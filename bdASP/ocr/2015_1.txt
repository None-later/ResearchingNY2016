ith climate change 
already affecting 
the world, the Uni-
versity at Albany is attempt-
ing to make a difference.
UAlbany introduced 
the Energy Campaign in 
the spring of 2007 as an 
electricity-saving competi-
tion among the six uptown 
residence halls. Now in its 
ninth year, the campaign is 
being expanded to include 
the Academic Podium and 
residential living areas.
Mary Ellen Mallia, the 
director for Environmental 
Sustainability, and Mary 
Alexis Leciejewski, the pro-
gram assistant for the Office 
of Environmental Sustain-
ability, hope to reduce elec-
tricity use the buildings the 
campaign is monitoring by 
10 percent from last year’s 
baseline.
While Mallia did admit 
that the goal is aggres-
sive, she also said that it is 
“completely realistic.” Last 
year the Energy Campaign 
attained an 8 percent reduc-
tion on campus. 
Eight percent may not 
sound like much, but each 
year the Energy Campaign 
saves around a million 
kilowatt-hours, or between 
$70,000 and $100,000 in 
electricity costs per year.
This year the Energy 
Campaign is pushing for 
joint action of students 
and staff to foster a more 

sustainable community 
at UAlbany. Residential 
Life has been increasing 
awareness of electrical 
waste, and it’s showing 
in the data. For example, 
Empire Commons and 
Freedom apartments 
have shown 30 percent 
reductions in electricity 
use over recent years. 
“It really is a focus 
on collective action,” 
Leciejewski said. “If you 
have faculty and staff 
setting the right example, 
the students who are 
working will carry those 
conservation habits with 
them for the rest of their 
life.”
Developing partner-
ships on the Academic 
Podium has proven more 
difficult, but it is important.
“We thought two things: 
First of all, we’re all in 
this together as a campus, 
so that doesn’t mean just 
harass the students and the 
residence halls. And only 
a third of our electricity is 
used there -- most of our 
electricity is used on the 
Podium,” Mallia said. 
This year, the Energy 
Campaign hopes to increase 
competitiveness among 
the academic buildings by 
rewarding the offices which 
cut electrical use by the 
greatest amount. 
“It is true that the resi-
dents earn a portion and we 
do try to fund it back with 
different green amenities,” 

Mallia said. “We want to 
try to make it something 
that can be purchased fairly 
quickly and can be used by 
students in the spring, be-
cause they’re the students in 
the fall who did the saving.” 
The Office of Envi-
ronmental Sustainability 
also takes a portion of the 
savings to fund their annual 
programs, such as the Give 
and Go Program, the Bike 
Share Program, and Docu-
ment Shredding Day, Mallia 
said. 
There are many ways to 
get involved in the  Energy 
Campaign. Starting Sept. 2, 
every two weeks the Energy 
Campaign will sponsor a 
new theme focusing on spe-
cific energy actions. One is 
“Think Outside The Bulb,” 
which students and staff can 

join in by replacing their old 
light bulbs with energy effi-
cient bulbs or by using day-
light rather than flipping on 
the switch. Another theme 
is the “Pledge to Conserve,” 
where students and staff can 
sign a lightning bolt con-
taining a method of energy 
saving that they pledge to 
practice this fall. 
   Anyone who posts a 
picture engaging in some-
thing related to the Energy 
Campaign with the hashtag 
#UAlbanyEnergy will be 
entered into a lottery for a 
$100 gift card. Every pic-
ture posted with the hashtag 
will count as an entry. For 
more information about the 
Energy Campaign, or to

campus, email gogreen@

Usage of My Involve-
ment has grown in recent 
years as features have been 
added to the platform, but 
data suggests it is not yet an 
integral part of the average 
student’s experience.
Michael Christakis, vice 
president for student affairs, 
has high hopes for My 
Involvement as a tool for 
administrators and stu-
dents and says he is happy 
with indications that more 
students are logging on. A 
total of 11,502 users signed 
in during the 2014-15 
academic year, account-
ing for about 1.4 million 
page views. The number of 
involvement markers com-
pleted– a central feature of 
the platform through which 
students map and track what 
they do outside their class-
rooms -- nearly doubled 
from the previous year.
The university contracted 
with the firm Collegiate 
Link to get My Involvement  
and it was primarily used 
for managing the rosters and 
events of student organiza-
tions when introduced in 

Fall 2007. 
New features have since 
expanded its reach, Christa-
kis says. These include pro-
grams that offer rewards to 
students who get involved 
and then track that in-
volvement. One of these is 
Pathways to Success, which 
allows students to swipe 
their ID cards to register as 

“involved” in events, and 
thus eligible for rewards. 
Applications for students 
seeking resident assistant 
and other jobs are also con-
ducted through My Involve-
ment.
“We were trying to give 
students reasons to get into 
the platform,” Christakis 
said. “What we were hear-
ing early on was that if you 

By KASSIE PARISI

Big things happened dur-
ing the year 1916. Activist 
Margaret Sanger opened the 
first birth control clinic in 
the United States. Journalist 
and pioneer fiction writer 
Jack London died at age 40. 
A baseball pitching, music 
playing elephant named 
Mary was put to death for 
trampling a man who was 
not trained in dealing with 
elephants. Almost a century 
has gone by, and even big-
ger things are happening. 
For one thing, in 2016, the 
Albany Student Press will 
turn 100.
The ASP is the Univer-
sity at Albany’s student 
newspaper (if you’re hold-
ing it right now reading 
this, that should be evident). 
This newspaper, which is 
independent and self-fund-
ed, offers a unique perspec-
tive of our school. We are 
allowed to say things that 
people don’t want us to say, 
and every so often we have 
the duty to speak for those 
who are not able to. Some-
times, in doing so, we make 
people angry.
The ASP does not exist 
to antagonize, despite what 
might be popular belief. It 
exists to tell the truth, and it 
exists to serve as the voice 
of all students. However, 

as I enter my fourth year 
working on this newspaper, 
it has become clear to me 
that the ASP has been miss-
ing something for years. It 
has been exclusive, and dis-
connected from the student 
body that, when established 
in 1916, it said it would 
give voice and truth to. 
I can’t pretend to know 
how every student on 
campus feels, but to me, 
100 years of the same-old, 
same-old is long enough. 
That’s why we’re giving 
UAlbany a new ASP. 
Thanks to a journalism 
visual design class from 
the spring 2015 semester 
(AJRL 392), the ASP has an 
entirely new look. A lot is 
expected from this news-
paper, and high standards 
have been set. Students 
last year spoke, and we 
listened. What we have 
now is a new, 21st century 
product that is more vibrant, 
exciting, and professional. 
After working all summer 
to prepare for our redesign, 
myself and the managing 
editor of the ASP intend to 
respond with a high quality 
product that will continue 
to grow, even after we’ve 
graduated at the end of this 
year. 
Looks only go so far, 
and so it was obvious to me

By MADELINE ST. AMOUR

There are two resources people 
generally use for help with a 
work-related issue: human re-
sources, or their mom. 
But there may be a third option. 
Many employers have Employee 
Assistance Programs, or EAPs, 
to provide extra resources for 
employees. 
The goal of EAPs is to ensure 
that employees can “be healthy, 
be successful, and be productive,” 
Brenda Seckerson, coordinator for 

the University at Albany’s EAP, 
said. 
Seckerson began her profes-
sional career 35 years ago as a 
high school teacher. She says she 
is a “helper,” and she earned a 
master’s degree in counseling in 
2000. 
“I’m here for human beings,” 
she said. 
This approach aids in two of 
EAPs’ main components: confi-
dentiality and neutrality. 
In UAlbany’s brochure about 
its EAP, it says that “no records 

are kept” to ensure complete con-
fidentiality for employees who use 
its services. Seckerson seconded 
this, saying that while she records 
attendance numbers for programs, 
she never records names. 
The EAP is neutral in that it 
serves everyone at its company or 
organization. Everyone employed 
by UAlbany can use EAP, from 
President Jones to teacher’s 
assistants (although students 
employed through work study are 
not eligible). 
“I’m trying to support all of us 
who are human beings,” Secker-
son said. 
UAlbany’s EAP gives em-
ployees a variety of options for 
support. Seckerson sends out a 
monthly newsletter, keeps an open 
lending library in her office, and 

holds various lunchtime pro-
grams. People can also meet with 
Seckerson one-on-one or, if they 
prefer, another EAP Coordina-
tor. All Coordinators within New 
York state can be used by any 
New York state employee. 
She’s helped people with dis-
agreements with other employees, 
getting financially stable, and just 
about everything in-between.
Seckerson tends to focus on 
financial wellness and elder 
care, as these are two topics that 
seem popular with and useful for 
employees. She aims to provide 
an array of information, though, 
to help as many employees as 
possible. Over the past few years, 
she’s hosted programs like “Un-
derstanding Your NYS Retire-
ment Pension Benefits,”  “Plastic 

Surgery: Getting Out of Debt,” 
and “Estate Planning, Wills, and 
Trusts.”
While EAPs didn’t reach New 
York until 1976 (the first was 
started in 1917), the state now 
has a Statewide Employee As-
sistance Program, dating back to 
1983. EAPs are funded by both 
the state and unions, according to 
Karen Dunn, program manager 
of the statewide EAP. EAPs are 
overseen by an EAP Committee, 
which is made up of represen-
tatives from unions as well as 
management. 
Workplaces outside of New 
York, both public and private, can 
have EAPs. As Seckerson said, 
this is a good benefit to be aware 
of when entering the working 
world. 

Code of conduct changes 
to adhere to Cuomo policy

EAP: A resource 
for future graduates 

By JANIE FRANK

The Community Rights 
and Responsibilities, Uni-
versity at Albany’s code 
of conduct for students, 
was updated this summer 
to provide more informa-
tion, clarify definitions and 
update procedures relating 
to sexual misconduct.
The changes made to the 
document were due in part 
to Gov. Cuomo’s Enough 
is Enough program, also 
referred to as New York 
Education Law Article 129-
B, which was signed into 
law on July 7. 
Nancy Lauricella, Execu-
tive Director of Community 
Standards, said the legisla-
tive decision was based on 
the SUNY Sexual Violence 
Prevention policies from 
December of 2014. 
“UAlbany, as a SUNY 
institution, had actually 
already adopted many of 
those procedures and 
guidelines into our code 
and had just a few changes 
to make in order to comply 
with the new state law,” 
Lauricella said. “We made 
those required changes and 
then notified all students 
and staff about the modifi-
cations [on Aug. 12].”
The required changes to 
the document were ap-
proved on Aug. 7, ex-
actly one month after Gov. 
Cuomo signed Enough is 
Enough into law. 
Chantelle Cleary, the Ti-
tle IX Coordinator appoint-
ed to UAlbany last year, 
was involved in changing 
and editing the code.
“I worked very closely 
with Community Standards 
to make the changes and 
ensure that the changes that 
were made comply with 
the changes required by 
the Education Law 129-B 
Amendment,” Cleary said.

Six new definitions were 
added to Section 2, “Defini-
tions,” including Reporting 
Individual, Respondent, and 
Title IX Coordinator. 
Cleary explained that 
word choice is important in 
these kinds of cases, which 
is why the definitions mat-
ter so much. 
For example, a student 
becomes the “respondent” 
only after they have entered 
into a judicial or conduct 
process. Before this, they 
are to be referred to as the 
“accused.” 
Previously, a part of the 
document entitled “Cases 
of Sexual Misconduct” was 
a bullet point under Section 
4: Student Conduct Proce-
dures. With the update, this 
has been made into it’s own 
section. This new section 
includes a Students’ Bill 
of Rights and a Policy for 
Alcohol and/or Drug Use 
Amnesty in Sexual Miscon-
duct Cases. 
The Bill of Rights 
ensures that the university 
will help students that are 
affected by sexual assault, 
harassment, or violence 
“regardless of whether the 
crime occurred on campus, 
off campus, or while study-
ing abroad.” 
One final change was 
made to the Community 
Rights and Responsibili-
ties to allow students one 
appeal in cases of sexual 
misconduct with no excep-
tions. 
This point, effective 
since the 2014 legislative 
decision regarding SUNY 
schools was passed, is not 
exclusive towards victims. 
“After the SUNY 
policies were implemented, 
both the reporting individu-
als and the accused students 
[received the right to ap-
peal],” Cleary said.
If a student is found to 

have violated the Commu-
nity Rights and Responsi-
bilities, this does not mean 
they have been charged 
with a crime. 
Certain steps are being 
taken to make sure stu-
dents are aware of their 
new rights. For example, 
an email outlining these 
changes was sent to the 
entire student body on Aug. 
21. In addition, Karl Luntta, 
the director of media rela-
tions at UAlbany, is helping 
to make sure that posters 
are being put up around 
campus. The posters, which 
refer to the Sexual Violence 
Victim/Survivor Bill of 
Rights, started to go up on 
Thursday, Aug. 27. 
“There currently are four 
on the Academic Podium 
and two in the LCs area 
– all permanently fixed,” 
Luntta said. “Soon, all RAs, 
Student Affairs, and Athlet-
ics will get them. They are 
meant to be displayed in 
spots where they are most 
visible to students.”
More than 120 of them 
will be posted in various lo-
cations throughout all three 
UAlbany campuses. 
The Community Rights 
and Responsibilities is not 
a document that needs to be 
updated every year, accord-
ing to Lauricella. 
“My office does review 
the document on a regular 
basis to ensure it is current 
and reflects our policies 
accurately,” she said. “If 
we find anything needs 
to be changed, we would 
work with the appropriate 
entities to get that done and 
approved.”
The last time the 
document was updated was 
Feb. 27. At that time, the 
document was 18 pages, 
including the cover. After 
this most recent update, it is 
now 21 pages.

OPINIONS.ASP@GMAIL.COM

By DIEGO CAGARA

The University at Albany cam-
pus is already so huge, yet it’s still 
expanding. As the amount of en-
rolled students here grows larger, 
it’s natural for some to become 
confused and lost, especially at 
back-to-school time.
   Whether an incoming fresh-
man, a returning senior or some-
where in between, it is helpful to 
plan ahead and try to get involved 
somehow—this will make the 
summer break-to-college transition 
much easier. 
   On the much-dreaded first day 
of classes on Aug. 26, there were 
already numerous tables set up 
throughout the Campus Center that 
were filled with brochures, hand-
outs, banners and helpful students 
who could inform people about 
their organizations.
   As the days go by, such groups 
continue trying to attract potential 
students who might have been 
hesitant at first. 
   Joining at least one club or 
organization will group students 
with other students who probably 
share the same interests, increasing 
the chances of making new friends 
on this gigantic campus. 
   Students should try to use this 
opportunity to reach out and see 
what interests them.
   This especially applies to 
incoming freshmen students, 
international students, and transfer 
students who are still acquainting 
themselves with the campus and 
the community here. Sure, a stu-
dent’s studies and classes are very 
important, but so is maintaining a 
healthy social life while in college.
   Commuters, like myself, may 
also find it a bit challenging to 
meet new people since we don’t 
live on campus so we can’t easily 
strike up conversations in dorms. 
   It was hard for me to make 
new friends as a freshman last year 
since I was too shy to join any 
clubs or organizations. I would 
huddle in a corner with my laptop 
in the Commuter & Transfer 
Lounge and just replay negative 
and miserable thoughts about how 
lonely I was on this campus. By 
spring 2015, I gained the courage 
to join the Albany Student Press, 
because of my dream to become a 
magazine editor one day. It still is 

challenging to make friends, but 
at least I pushed past my comfort 
zone to do something I ended up 
loving. 
   When I visited the Commuter 
& Transfer Lounge on my first day 
back from summer, I was surprised 
to find several vending machines 
and a table with a mini-buffet of 
sandwiches and iced water. The 
room had once just been filled with 
seats for the most of last year, but 
it was nice to see UAlbany was 
making an effort to welcome new 
students there, too.
 I was stunned to see various 
stands with useful guides and 
brochures set up in the Science 
Library. While getting involved 
is highly recommended, doing the 
best in students’ studies is impera-
tive. Since the university took the 
extra step to try to reach out to 
students, this further proves that 
starting the year with a prepared 
mindset goes a long way.
   After all, a good first impres-
sion is key.
   In order to get involved, one 
could also go onto MyInvolve-
ment.org, a website that lists all 
the clubs and organizations here at 
UAlbany. It has also undergone a 
redesigned layout, making it more 
visually appealing. If anyone is lost 
about how to get started, there is 
an interactive option at the bottom 
of the page that will easily guide 
them. 
   Furthermore, one can check 
the UAlbany Events Calendar 
online, which lists many significant 
events that are happening in and 
around campus by day, month, and 
even year. Students interested in 
sports and athletic activities should 
refer to UAlbanySports.com. 
   Overall, a lot is happening 
here at UAlbany, so students 
should be sure to research about 
events, activities and organiza-
tions that may personally or even 
academically interest them. 
   But always remember to 
practice good time management. 
This may sound clichéd, but it 
is essential to balance time for 
studying, getting involved and also 
for oneself— overloading your 
schedule with too many activities 
is unhealthy and strenuous. With 
classes back on, we all deserve 
some time to just relax and lounge 
around too.

n the days of Caesar, the 
politicians of Rome would 
borrow money from their 
rich friends in order to provide 
circuses for the masses, supply-
ing them with entertainment in 
exchange for their vote. 
Sound familiar? Today, the 
only difference is the form of 
the circus: the campaign itself 
provides our entertainment. And 
now, after so many years of 
dull, politically correct po-
litical theater, we finally have a 
clown: a tremendously wealthy, 
undeniably smart, unbelievably 
popular, and resilient clown. 
His name is Donald Trump.
Trump’s performance this 
summer has been impressive, 
to say the least. Not only did he 
quickly jump ahead of the entire 
Republican field—which feels 
like it stretches on for miles—
and maintain a strong lead for 
two straight months, but he did 
so while providing more enter-
tainment to the people than we 
could have ever hoped for. 
One standout moment of the 
campaign was the Lindsey Gra-
ham phone number give-away. 
Trump gave one of his usual 
speeches in which he attacks a 
wide range of Republican fig-
ures, and this time John McCain 
made the list. Trump claimed 
McCain is “not a war hero,” 
saying he preferred soldiers who 
weren’t captured. While it’s 
his opinion, such a slip of the 
tongue would have ended the 
career of any other politician. 
The next day a press conference 
would have been held where the 
politician or candidate would 
retract their statement and resign 
from the race. 
We’ve seen it a dozen times. 
Indeed, McCain’s “boyfriend” 
and lackey, Lindsey Graham, 
immediately demanded that 
Trump do just that, and called 
him a “jackass.” In response, 
at an event in Graham’s home 
state of South Carolina, Trump 
pointedly refused to apologize 
and slammed Graham in turn, 
giving away the senator’s cell 
phone number as proof that 
Graham had sought favors from 
him in the past. The audience, 
consisting mostly of veterans, 
greeted these insults with much 
applause. 

Another standout moment 
was just last week, when Trump 
called up a woman from the 
audience to tug on his hair to 
prove it wasn’t a toupée.  
On a more serious note, 
Trump has topped almost every 
poll for weeks now (Walker still 
barely beats him in Wisconsin, 
but Bush hasn’t had the same 
luck in Florida), earning three 
times the support of his runner-
up, Ben Carson, in the latest 
Gravis national poll (40/13). But 
why is he doing so unexpectedly 
well?  
One reason: anger.  
When Trump makes inappro-
priate comments and the media 
goes wild, his supporters don’t 
care. They don’t support him 
because he’s politically cor-
rect; they support him because 
they’re angry. When Jeb Bush 
calls him a fraud, pointing out 
his spotty record and argu-
ing that he’s not conservative 
enough, Trump’s supporters 
don’t care. They don’t support 
him because he’s conserva-
tive; they support him because 
they’re angry. When Frank 
Luntz shows a group of Trump 
supporters a video montage of 
his flip-flops, they really don’t 
care. They don’t support him 
because he’s consistent; they 
support him because they’re 
angry.  
This anger is not, as the 
casual observer might guess, the 
anger of old, rich, white people 
against young, poor, Hispanics. 
No, this is the anger of Repub-
lican voters against the political 
class. 
The average Republican hates 
(domestic) government. He 
hates politicians. He even hates 
Republican politicians. The rise 
of Trump marks a complete 
breakdown of trust in any politi-
cian, Republican or Democrat, 
incumbent or challenger, state or 
federal. In Trump, people see a 
choice between various politi-
cians or a businessman, and 
they’ll vote for anyone over a 
politician, even Trump.  
But still, why Trump? Carly 
Fiorina is a businesswoman. 
Ben Carson is a neurosurgeon. 
So why Trump?  
One small reason is the level 
of anger Republicans feel. It 
isn’t enough to elect someone 
who’s not a politician, they want 
to elect someone who will be a 

slap in the face to all politicians, 
especially the party leaders and 
the rest of the Establishment. 
They want revenge; since they 
gave the Republican Party con-
trol of the country, and nothing 
good happened, they’re going 
to give Trump control of the 
Republican Party.  
The other, greater reason is 
Trump himself, both who he is 
and what he’s doing. He knows 
how to play the game -- that’s 
why he’s masterfully controlled 
this election season since the 
day of his announcement. He 
absolutely dominates the media, 
causing many people to forget 
the names of half the candidates 
running against him. When he 
refuses to pledge support to the 
eventual nominee and threatens 
to run as a third party, he not so 
subtly informs the Republican 
Party that their only chance at 
winning the general election is 
to nominate him. 
And whatever the official 
estimate is, Trump is rich, and 
rich translates to success for the 
average American. If he was so 
successful at business, the voters 
reason that he’ll be successful 
at governing. More impor-
tantly, being as rich as he is, 
Trump can’t be bought, which 
means that he might actually 
do something meaningful, good 
or bad, breaking the monotony 
of no-change coming from 
Washington. It helps that he’s 
fearless. He says what he wants 
and does what he wants. This 
is a welcome change from the 
boring, canned statements that 
other candidates and politicians 
deliver. All this contributes to 
genuine support for Trump.   
I see Trump going far in this 
race. He does have a certain 
charisma, and as various candi-
dates start dropping out, I think 
many Republicans will join the 
message-sending movement that 
is Trump. And if he wins the 
Republican nomination, he’ll 
find a lot of Independents and 
even Democrats who are also 
fed up with all politicians. It’ll 
be even better if he runs against 
Hillary, the very incarnation of 
the political class. Trump’s got 
my vote for now, not only to 
piss off everyone else in Wash-
ington, but also because I’d like 
to see another four years of him 
entertaining us.

Students at the University at Albany are offered several ways to get 
involved on campus through clubs and organizations specializing in 
academics, volunteer work and social activities.

n today’s world, a student can 
learn from anywhere. They 
don’t have to be sitting in a 
physical classroom listening to 
a live lecture at their university. 
The internet has permanently 
altered the landscape of how 
information is provided.
The University at Albany and 
schools throughout the SUNY 
system need to catch up when it 
comes to providing programs that 
reflect the modern world. One 
way to do that is to expand the ac-
cessibility of cross registration.
Cross registration is when a 
student enrolls for a course at 
another school through UAlbany 
and is not charged extra tuition. 
The university has two cross 
registration agreements in place, 
one with local colleges (including 
private ones) in the Hudson-Mo-
hawk Association of Colleges and 
Universities, and one with SUNY.
Currently, a student has to 
enroll in at least 12 credits at 
UAlbany before they can cross 
register for an additional course at 
another college. For the Hudson-
Mohawk agreement, students 
can’t cross register for a course 
that is offered at UAlbany (in the 
SUNY agreement they can).
Additionally, a cross registra-
tion form has to be filled out and 
approved by both UAlbany and 
the college that will be hosting the 
cross registered student.
Considering that only 21 UAl-
bany students per semester cross 
registered for a course at another 
college in the 2014-15 academic 
year, this is too difficult of a pro-
cess with too many limits. 
Meanwhile, the options to 
benefit from doing so are abun-
dant. In recent years, SUNY has 

created a one-stop site for all of 
the online courses and degree pro-
grams offered throughout the 64 
campus statewide system, called 
Open SUNY. 
For the Fall 2015 semester, 
there are over 5,000 courses 
listed on the Open SUNY web-
page. Only 82 of them are from 
UAlbany. If a student from this 
university wants to take an online 
course, they are much more likely 
to find what they want through 
cross registering than from the 
current offerings here.
Karen Chico Hurst, the univer-
sity registrar, also would like to 
see more students take advantage 
of cross registration. According to 
Hurst, there has traditionally been 
apprehension among the univer-
sity staff when a student wants to 
cross register because it has been 
a complicated process in recent 
years, but has gotten better. 
Hurst is hoping for more 
awareness of cross registration 
among advisers, and for them 
to proactively provide students 
with information about existing 
options. 
“It’s kind of on the student to 
look. I’d rather it be [that univer-
sity staff say], ‘Hey, look what’s 
available,” she said. 
She also said that UAlbany 
makes an effort to be as flexible 
as possible, while some other 
colleges in the system may not.
For example, UAlbany allows 
students from other colleges who 
want to cross register here to fax 
in their application form. This is 
not a uniform policy throughout 
the system, and some campuses 
may require that a person bring 
their form in person with photo 
identification. Obviously, that 
is impractical if a student from 
downstate who wants to take an 

online course offered by a school 
in western New York.
The SUNY system revised their 
cross registration policies in 2013 
to advance their strategic goals 
of student mobility and degree 
completion after 40 years without 
any changes. However, there is 
a long way to go before it is an 
integrated system that works well 
for students.
If students are going to be 
able to take full advantage of 
new statewide initiatives like 
Open SUNY, further changes are 
needed.
First, students should not have 
to take 12 credits at their home 
college before being eligible to 
cross register. If they want to take 
nine at UAlbany and six online 
through other colleges (especially 
if UAlbany doesn’t have them), 
they should be able to. There 
needs to be a more lenient cutoff.
Second, advisers need to make 

sure students are aware of these 
options, as well as identify the 
best online courses in each major 
offered by colleges in cross regis-
tration agreements with UAlbany 
and suggest them to students.
Most of all, the process has to 
be streamlined and made easier. 
All applications and approvals 
should be moved to a standard-
ized online platform for the 
SUNY agreement that also allows 
for seamless information shar-
ing between the home and host 
school.  
The SUNY system is certainly 
working on becoming more inte-
grated and flexible for students, 
and UAlbany is playing a major 
role with that in many areas. 
UAlbany needs to realize that 
the future of higher education 
is flexibility, convenience, and 
individualized offerings for every 
student - and that future can’t 
come soon enough.

Expanding campus online

ACADEMICS

Madeline St. Amour / Albany Student Press
College students handle several responsibilities including work, classes and clubs and organizations. 
Most of their time is devoted to the responsibilities they acquire during their time in college.  

CAMPUS LIFE

Of course, I do not feel like my 
generation is portrayed accurate-
ly. I always come across indi-
viduals who try hard to defeat the 
perception of us that the rest of 
the population has. I believe more 
credit should be given to students 
in my generation.
Students have to perform the 
ultimate juggling act by balancing 
school work, jobs, clubs and or-
ganizations they may be involved 
in, handling their finances, and 
maintaining a decent social life. 
From a person who is in involved 
in this metaphorical circus act, I 
know exactly how hard it is.
I know that other students are 
in similar predicaments. I have to 
say that college students are some 
of the hardest working people 
that I can think of. It is a shame 
that we sometimes do not get the 
credit that we deserve. 
College is no joke. We have 
to juggle anywhere between one 
to six classes ranging from the 
basic 100 level to 400 level senior 
classes, and even some graduate 
level classes. We constantly have 
to be aware of readings, home-
work, and essays, we have to take 
notes during lecture and be talked 
at for an hour to an hour and a 
half. It also seems as though we 
really have no breaks, because 
even during those breaks, we still 
have to do assignments.
Over time there has been a 
steady increase in the enrollment 
of students in American univer-
sities. In fall 2015, “some 20.2 
million students are expected to 
attend American colleges and uni-
versities, constituting an increase 

of about 4.9 million since fall 
2000,” according to the National 
Center for Education Statistics 
(NCES). And of those 20.2 mil-
lion, NCES reported, “about 7.0 
million students will attend two-
year institutions and 13.2 million 
will attend four-year institutions 
in fall 2015.”
More and more young adults 
are taking on the responsibility 
that being in college requires. 
However, on top of being enrolled 
in university full time, most 
students tackle employment either 
outside or within the university.
In general, the number of em-
ployed people ages 16 to 24 years 
old increased by 2.1 million to 
20.3 million from April to July in 
2015,  according to the Bureau of 
Labor Statistics.
Students are also involved in 
several clubs and organizations 
on campus that can require a lot 
of attention. The University at 
Albany specifically requires each 
recognized club and organization 
to hold at least one event for the 
student body to participate in each 
year. Clubs also often take part in 
tabling events for recruitment or 
fundraisers, weekly or biweekly 
meetings. All of these events can 
take several weeks, if not months, 
to plan.
Some students also opt to live 
locally in apartments rented out 
specifically to college students 
who choose not to live in on-cam-
pus dorms. Those students then 
have to worry about expenses 
including rent, electricity bills, 
cable and Internet bills. 
I realize that not all students 

have to handle all of these pres-
sures, especially not all at once. 
Journalist Natalie Gil wrote for 
the Guardian in Jan. 2014, “My 
university is right to ban part-time 
work” because “there’s no way I 
could have held down a part-time 
job as an undergraduate. With 
relatively short eight-week terms, 
at least three essays constantly 
on the go, and a never-ending 
reading list, on top of the extra-
curricular commitments so crucial 
for one’s CV, I would have 
burned out.” 
Gil speaks for many undergrad-
uates who would rather not have 

to handle the pressures that they 
have to feel just being enrolled for 
a semester. And I fully agree with 
Gil that it is difficult to juggle 
these daunting tasks on a daily 
basis.
I must commend the strength of 
today’s young adults for this same 
reason. Maybe it is my naiveté, 
but this has been the highest stress 
situation I have ever been in and 
I am sure I am not speaking for 
only myself when I say that. 
Being a college student is 
proof of someone’s strength and 
determination, and not every one 
can handle it. 

T

his generation of young adults faces an 
eternal stigma of laziness and lack of 
motivation. No matter how much we 
do, we are thought of as not doing enough.

    Fifth Harmony stopped by 
the Albany Palace Theatre on 
Monday, Aug. 24 as part of their 
Reflection: The Summer Tour 
to showcase their music to local 
fans.
The girl group was met with 
a nearly sold out theater and 
screaming fans who sang along 
throughout the 70-minute set list 
in support of their debut album 
“Reflection.” It debuted at number 
five with 80,000 copies sold 
on the US Billboard 200 in late 
January.
The five ladies—Camilla 
Cabello, Lauren Jauregui, 
Normani Kordei Hamilton, Ally 
Brooke Hernandez and Dinah 
Jane Hansen—stand as the most 
successful act from the “The X 
Factor USA,” despite having 
come in third place back in 2012. 
Their multi-platinum single 
“Worth It” has peaked at number 
12 on the Hot 100 so far and 
recently won the Teen Choice 
Award for Choice Summer Song.
Opening the concert with 
“Boss,” Fifth Harmony managed 
to maintain an energetic and 
enthusiastic atmosphere, each 
member having her fair share 
of singing and dance numbers. 
They performed a mash-up of 
“Miss Movin On,” Queen’s 
“We Will Rock You,” Taylor 
Swift’s “Bad Blood” and 
Rihanna’s “Bitch Better Have 
My Money” which initially had 
the potential to be overwhelming 

but ended up sounding unique. 
Continuing with their synth-
pop hit “Sledgehammer” which 
was followed by a row of songs 
straight from their “Reflection” 
album, the ladies changed gears 
when they replaced the usual 
lively numbers with an emotional 
speech directed towards the 
audience.
“Now I want you to talk to your 
reflection…and tell yourself, I am 
brave…honest…and beautiful,” 
played an overhead narration 
which the five women had pre-
recorded, offering the mostly 
tween audience some heartfelt 
advice before performing the 
aptly-named “Brave Honest 
Beautiful.”
Fifth Harmony has frequently 
said that female empowerment 
and self-confidence are part 

of their overarching message.
Member Normani Kordei said 
in March, “that’s what our goal 
is…and people can definitely see 
that we incorporate that [in our 
music],” in an interview on “The 
Today Show.” 
After paying homage to 
singer-songwriter Mariah Carey 
as well with “Like Mariah,” Fifth 
Harmony once again slowed down 
and took seats onstage while 
close to the crowd with five lone 
spotlights on them, creating a 
more intimate atmosphere. 
Members Ally Brooke 
and Lauren Jauregui shined 
particularly with their vocals 
during a major acoustic mashup 
of Jason Derulo’s “Want to Want 
Me,” Carey’s “Dreamlover,” The 
Weeknd’s “Can’t Feel My Face,” 
Ed Sheeran’s “Don’t” and “You 

Need Me, I Don’t Need You” 
and Nico and Winz’s “Am I 
Wrong.”
The night’s penultimate 
number “Worth It” elicited the 
loudest screams and applause 
from the crowd as the members 
had fun dancing all over the 
illuminated stage with sass and 
abandon. 
Finally, after a brief encore 
break, the members reappeared 
one last time to perform the 
closing song “Body Rock.” 
During this, the whole theater 
briefly went dark. Only the 
ladies’ individual microphone 
stands suddenly lit up, shocking 
the animated Harmonizers 
before them. Member Dinah 
Jane was the highlight with her 
strong vocals, having led the 
concluding dance number amid 
falling confetti and deafening 
screams.
Although the ladies didn’t 
have enough time to intimately 
interact much with the audience, 
the overall concert was a highly 
energetic and visual spectacle, 
coupled with striking vocals and 
surprise dance routines. 
The concert had first opened 
up with three acts: Natalie La 
Rose, former “X Factor USA” 
contestant Bea Miller and 
Common Kings, all of whom had 
their own strengths. 
La Rose’s dancing abilities 
shone throughout and her single 
“Somebody” excited the tween 
crowd. Miller performed songs 
from her debut album “Not an 

Apology” and the atmosphere 
intensified when she performed 
a grunge version of Nick Jonas’s 
single “Chains” while ending with 
the anthemic “Fire N Gold.”
Hailing from Orange County, 
CA, Common Kings initially 
had trouble connecting with the 
audience who evidently weren’t 
familiar with their music but 
later livened the theater up with 
impressive guitar solos and 
performing a remix of DJ Snake 
and Lil Jon’s “Turn Down for 
What.” During one of their 
performances, Fifth Harmony 
member Dinah Jane Hansen 
surprised the crowd when she 
came onstage and danced with 
Common Kings. They ended 
with an emotional cover of Wiz 
Khalifa and Charlie Puth’s “See 
You Again” which had much of 
the audience softly waving their 
flashlight-enabled smartphones in 
the air.
This was the second time that 
Fifth Harmony has visited the 
Capital Region for a concert stop. 
They had performed at Upstate 
Concert Hall in Clifton Park for 
the original Reflection Tour back 
in late March. Despite their busy 
tour schedule, Fifth Harmony also 
managed to find time to film and 
release a music video for “I’m 
in Love with a Monster,”  an 
original song that will feature in 
the upcoming “Hotel Transylvania 
2” film.
Their current summer tour is 
scheduled to end at San Jose, 
Calif. this December.

Fresh-faced television writer 
Nic Pizzolatto bounced back from 
his stellar crime-drama success 
of 2014 with a second season of 
“True Detective” that premiered 
June 21, 2015 on HBO. The 
eight-episode series was again 
entirely written by Pizzolatto, with 
the directing handled by multiple 
parties, as season one director 
Cary Fukunaga did not return for 
the second installation of the show 
due to alleged rumors of drama 
that had arisen between the writer 
and director post season-one. The 
bulky cast included heavyweights 
Colin Farrell, Rachel McAdams 
and Vince Vaughn, along with 
newcomer Taylor Kitsch of “John 

Carter” (2012) and “X-Men 
Origins: Wolverine” (2009) laced-
fame.
“There’s no relationship be-
tween the stories and characters 
[from season one and two], which 
was the result of fully committing 
to something new, but I do think 
that the seasons have a deep, close 
bond in sensibility and vision, a 
similar soul, though this is a more 
complex world and field of char-
acters,” said Pizzolatto in a Q&A 
Session with HBO this past May. 
It became clear how true this 
statement was after viewing the 
first handful of episodes. Ferrell 
was transformed into the moder-
ately washed-up, substance-fiend 
detective Ray Velcoro (complete 
with the uncomfortable moustache 

style that graced the upper lip of 
Matthew McConaughey through-
out portions of season one), while 
McAdams filled the role of knife-
wielding, badass detective Ani 
Bezzerides. An aging, baggy-eyed 
Vince Vaughn was cast perfectly 
as an aging, baggy-eyed gangster 
Frank Seymon and Taylor Kitsch 
was molded into the character of 
the sexually-confused California 
Highway Patrol Officer, Paul 
Woodrugh. This overall dynamic 
cast of characters showed the vast 
differences between the freshman 
and sophomore installations of 
the series, because instead of the

The 20-year-old Computer Sci-
ence major and Latham native has 
been mixing and remixing music 
since the fourth grade. Much of 
the genres of music Lachhander 
works with combine a Caribbean 
vibe with an underground dance 
hall sound.
Music has always been an 
important part of Lachhander’s 
life. His familial heritage from 
the South American country of 
Guyana had a strong influence on 
the type of music he was exposed 
to growing up. 
Much of Lachhander’s style 
originates from reggae and dance 
hall CDs family members would 
listen to, as well as visiting 
Jamaica and learning more about 
the West Indian entertainment 
industry.
 “When I started hearing about 
the West Indian entertainment 
industry, they had their own Ca-
ribbean type vibe. But I had more 
of an underground dance hall vibe, 
so I helped bring a new style to 
the market,” says Lachhander. “I 
feel like I’ve evolved the style and 
then added other styles combined 
with it because I grew up here 
[in America]. Not a lot of people 
listen to reggae or dance hall, they 
listen to rap or pop, so I imple-
mented that type because I’m 
always exposed to it.”
In eighth grade Lachhander was 
able to sell his first CD to a record 
label and since then has been 
releasing mixes to the public. His 
CDs, under the name of Impact 
Soundz, can be found throughout 
New York, New Jersey, the Carib-
bean, and Canada. Lachhander 

estimates that thousands of units 
of his CDs have been sold during 
his active years.
Lachhander’s family has been 
supportive of his passion for 
music. “They didn’t expect it to be 
as big until they heard that family 
down there [in Guyana] saw my 
CDs in store, and then friends 
of the family saw the CDs too,” 
says Lachannder. “I remember 
when I went down to Queens all I 
would hear is some of my CDs in 
people’s cars blasting. And then 
stores would play it very loudly 
too.”
Through both mix and remix 
CDs, Lachhander has been able 
to express his music in different 
ways. He explains that mix CDs 
allow him to express creativity 
and tell a story through music, 
while remixing helps express 
emotions and allows people an-
other way to interpret songs. 
A lot of time and effort is 
required to make his music pos-
sible. “A mix CD could prob-
ably take me a couple of days, a 
remix CD could take me a couple 
of months,” says Lachhander. 
“Before I even start a mix, I make 
a story of how I want it to start 
and end. I want everything to be 
smooth. But with remix CDs you 
go in and only know a general gist 
of what you’re going to do. You 
start a remix and just play around, 
so it takes a while to be done.”
Creating the music involves 
the use of numerous computer 
software programs that were not 
available to DJs and remixers 
over a decade ago. As opposed to 
the traditional practice of using 

turntables, Lachhander uses a 
combination of Sony Asset Pro, 
Adobe Audition, and FL Studio to 
create instrumental sound, make 
beats, then master, render, and 
equalize the music.
Impact Soundz, Lachhander’s 

Soundcloud page, has nearly 
3,800 followers as well as 2.6 
million plays of his remixes, not 
including his CDs. 
On Sept. 2, Lachhander will 
be releasing his 33rd album titled 
“Remixer Paradise 2k15.” The 

album is the fourth of the “Re-
mixer Paradise” series, which 
has already released volumes 
one through three. The Remixer 
Paradise promotional CDs have all 
been released exclusively online 
and are available for free. 
Lachhander has chosen to 
release his music for free online in 
an effort to reach a wider global 
audience and to create a longer 
album. Typically when releasing 
a physical CD, there is a maxi-
mum cut off point of 80 minutes. 
The exclusive online release of 
“Remixer Paradise 2k15” will be a 
total of three hours and 23 minutes 
long, comprised of 53 tracks.
The new promotional CD not 
only features remixes from Lach-
hander (Impact Soundz), but also 
from collaborators such as DJ 
Supakid, Unique Soundz, Massiv 
Flo and others. Also featured on 
the CD is DJ JonOne, who has 
worked with famous EDM DJ and 
remixer Avicii in the past. 
“Remixer Paradise 2k15” 
will be the last CD Lachhander 
will be releasing publically for 
a while. Having just transferred 
from Hudson Valley Commu-
nity College, this will be his first 
semester at UAlbany. Lachhander 
plans to focus on his school-work 
until his expected graduation in 
Spring 2017, and wishes to pursue 
a profession within the computer 
science field.
When discussing the attention 
his music has attracted over the 
years, Lachhander expressed that 
his main motivation is his love for 
music. “I used to love the fame 
but as it comes down to it now, I 
just do it for the music. Nowadays 
some people are only doing it for 
the fame, and they don’t take a 
step back to take a look at the mu-
sic and see if it makes sense.”
Lachhander plans to continue 
mixing and remixing music in his 
spare time as a hobby, and looks 
forward to beginning his first 
semester at UAlbany this Fall. 
His promotional CD “Remixer 
Paradise 2k15” will be available 
online Sept. 2.

B

eing a full time college student can leave 
little time for outside hobbies, but that’s 
not the case for University at Albany 
student Sean Lachhander. “I have to find time 
for music,” says Lachhander. “Whenever I get 
stressed I put down the school work and just play 
around with it.”

Sean Lachhander, a junior transfer 
student, has been mixing music since 
he was in the fourth grade. Lachhander, 
whose family is from Guyana, said that 
his remixes take on a sound that is not 
the classic West Indian style. Instead, 
Lachhander combines a Caribbean style 
with rap, reggae, and even pop genres.

By ZOE HICKS
   
Life is full of little mysteries. While most 
don’t find their life filled with the kind of 
suspenseful capers that might draw Sherlock 
Holmes to the case or belong in an Agatha 
Christie novel, there are questions that rise up 
every day about the small details in life that 
nag at us, only to remain unanswered. Whether 
it’s why the car in front of you at the stoplight 
chose their vanity plate, or just how tall that 
actor really is, our curiosity is often tested but 
rarely satisfied. Until now. 
Enter Starlee Kine. Like many others, her 
childhood was spent obsessing over whodun-
its. Now, she spends her adulthood solving 
mysteries herself, but not just any myster-
ies. There are plenty of people to solve the 
high-profile murders and jewel heists. Those 
flashy cases with high stakes act as magnets for 
most sleuths, but leave a void of available and 
willing detectives to solve the more ordinary 
mysteries, which can often be just as interest-
ing and far more personal. 
This is where Starlee Kine has found her 
niche with her podcast “Mystery Show” on 
Gimlet. Every week she takes on a new case, 
giving answers to the questions that have been 
tugging at a person’s mind, but which they 
were unable to solve themselves. 
Kine isn’t like most other investigators. 
To preface her first case, “Video Store,” in 
which she sought the fate of a video store that 
seemed to vanish overnight Kine says, “I do 
not have a head full 
of encyclopedic 
knowledge. I am 
neither autistic, nor 
addicted to mor-
phine. I can only re-
member two jokes. 
But that won’t stop 
me. I will be talk-
ing to friends and 
strangers about their 

mysteries, big and small, and trying to solve 
them.” 
With neither the usual gimmicks in per-
sonality or case aiding the detectives on our 
screens and in our books, “Mystery Show” is 
able to capture its audience through the special 
emphasis it places on the process, rather than 
the solution. Kine doesn’t give a dramatic pre-
sentation of her genius a la Christie’s Hercule 
Poirot. In fact, more often than not, whether 
there will be a solution is a more interesting 
reveal than what that answer actually is.
 After chasing every lead and calling on ev-
ery favor to track down Britney Spears to find 
out why she was photographed with a certain 
book years prior, or scouring every record of 
the name found on a belt buckle to return it to 
the owner decades after it was lost, the thrill of 
“Mystery Show” isn’t found in why the book 
was read or how the buckle was lost, just if it 
can be learned at all. Kine is able to fulfill the 
desire everyone has to simply satisfy their curi-
osity. The mystery may not be life-changing or 
even important, but it is irritating not to know. 
Her only rule when taking on a case is that 
the answer can’t be found on the internet, so 
she goes through every channel she can with 
the time and the will to solve a case, embody-
ing the fantasy of the detective that can belong 
to anyone. As she solves the case through 
fascinating and mundane and obvious ways, 
not just talking to but also connecting with the 
people she comes across on the way, “Mys-
tery Show” brings to mind the old cliche, “It’s 
not the destination, but the journey.”

fresh from being put on 
leave due to allegations of 
accepting a sexual bribe 
from a high profile Hol-
lywood actress, discovers 
Caspere’s abandoned 
corpse and alerts the 
authorities to the scene, 
which includes Bezzeri-
des along with Velcoro. 
The plot continues into 
the next few episodes in 
a very broken manner, 
with all of the characters 
being told different things 
about what is going on in 
the investigation and how 
they should respond.
In the first episode we 
also learn of Vaughn’s 
character, Frank, his role 
in the city, and how he 
ties in with Ferrell and the 
now-deceased Caspere, 
who had apparently 
brokered money for the 
aging mobster in an at-
tempt to get him in on a 
rail corridor deal, which 
would guarantee mas-
sive amounts of money in 
return. 
As the episodes drag 
on, we learn that Caspere 
did much more than get 
killed; he had double-
crossed Frank, stolen 
more money than initially 
suspected and had a bit of 
a sex problem.  Although 
this “main” plot remains 
throughout the season, 
it becomes diluted with 
vague sub-plots of the 
numerous characters. 
From the broken home 
and drug use of Velcoro, 
the sexually confused, 
ex-“Blackwater” security 
officer Woodrugh, to sex 

parties for the elite in 
northern California.
We’re also filled in 
on the odd past of Bez-
zerides, her sex-camera 
performing sister, and her 
hippie father as portrayed 
by David Morse, which 
is a backstory that can’t 
seem to get out the way 
of itself. 
Although the cast per-
forms their roles perfectly, 
and T-Bone Burnett once 
again provides music so 
fitting for the mood, the 
season just doesn’t have 
the direction of the first. 
Maybe it was due to the 
fact that Pizzolatto created 
too big a monster to take 
on so early in his career, 
or due to poor directing 
and lack of consistency 
in literal direction and 
development of the story. 
Even before I watched 
the second season, I had 
to remind myself time 
and time again “this isn’t 
going to be anything like 
season one at all.” The 
beauty of the freshman 
installation of “True De-
tective” was the fact that 
there were two dynamic 
characters, each with 
their clear back stories 
and a killer plot (no pun 
intended). Season two 
just seemed too dynamic, 
too confusing and too 
long-winded. The theme 
and concept were there. 
However, the execution 
was much too shaky and 
broken, almost difficult to 
watch at some points. 
“I’ll usually have an 
end that makes a kind of 

emotional sense to me, 
but there’s always a big 
question mark next to it, 
because you need to be 
willing to throw your pre-
conceived ending out the 
window if the characters 
and story go in a direc-
tion you didn’t foresee,” 
Pizzolatto said during an 
HBO Connect interview.
One of the most com-
mon critiques was that 
throughout the first six 
episodes no one knew 
what was going on. To 
that point, the level of 
confusion the audience 
was feeling was the same 
level of confusion each 
of the characters were 
feeling. Pizzolatto did a 
fantastic job of capturing 
the essence of bureau-
cracy within local and 
state government and law 
enforcement. 
Even though this was 
a major criticism of the 
second season, it could 
have been done intention-
ally to illustrate just how 
in the dark mid-level civil 
servants are when faced 
with the interests of the 
upper-echelons of the elite 
ruling class. Perhaps the 
deeply introspective Piz-
zolatto created too-perfect 
of a story that couldn’t be 
given justice on-screen. 
Either way, a third 
season is in the works 
due to the contract that 
was signed between HBO 
and the writer. Hope-
fully the lukewarm second 
season can be a learning 
experience for everyone 
involved.

weren’t involved with 
a student club or orga-
nization you weren’t 
necessarily going to My 
Involvement.”
Involvement markers 
are a signature feature to 
get more students using 
My Involvment. Some 
3,124 students completed 
six or more involvement 
markers in the 2014-15 
academic year.
   But, that leaves 
nearly 15,000 students 
averaging less than two 
involvement markers 
completed each year. 
This suggests that most 
of the student body 
participates minimally 
in tracking involvement 
markers, which is a 
primary metric in judging 
the usage level of My 
Involvement. Nearly 
9,000 students completed 
no markers.
   This may be because 
students have had trouble 
interacting with the 

platform. Austin Ostro, 
treasurer of Hillel, said 
that last year there were 
occasional problems with 
administering his group 
through My Involvement. 
   More recently, in 
the week before classes 
started, members of 
Kappa Alpha Pi fraternity 
became frustrated with 
My Involvement when 
their page was unexpect-
edly made non-public, 
according Hans Hyppo-
lite, the vice president of 
the fraternity.
   Other students are 
more supportive of the 
website. Kelvin Andrick-
son, who graduated from 
the Emerging Leaders 
Program last year, said, 
“MyInvolvement is 
where all the clubs are, 
anyway, so it’s the easi-
est way to get involved.”
   Lindsey Chase, 
graduate student assis-
tant for the Leaders in 
Service Program, says 

she will use the platform 
to advertise her group’s 
activities. 
   “What we’ll be using 
it for is posting our flyers 
for our programs,” she 
said.
   Christakis acknowl-
edges that My Involve-
ment could be further 
improved, but he empha-
sized its current value. 
   “It helps me enhance 
the student experience if 
I’ve got good information 
in terms of what students 
want, what they are en-
gaging in, or maybe what 
I’m not delivering to 
them that I should deliver 
to them,” he said.
   And students, 
he said, can use My 
Involvement to print out 
comprehensive records 
of their activities outside 
the classroom. Such an 
extracurricular record 
can be an asset when job 
hunting and trying to 
show employers com-
munication, teamwork 
and other skills honed 
through activities outside 
the classroom.

New students can use My Involvement to mark their involvement in clubs at 
UAlbany, but numbers show that many students don’t use this feature.

something else must be 
fixed. I was an editor sitting 
behind a computer for three 
years and now, as Editor-in-
Chief, I intend to be outside, 
interacting, and communi-
cating with this school, as 
does the entire staff of this 
newspaper. The editors of 
this paper should not be the 
ones filling the pages every 
week, because we aren’t the 
only students on campus. 
This school is incredibly 
diverse, and the newspa-
per needs to reflect that. 
The paper should have the 
voices of the 200 plus clubs 
on campus. It should have 
voices from all of the dif-
ferent cultures that exist on 
campus filling the pages. It 
should have voices from ad-
juncts, full-time professors, 
and the student government. 
It should hear from the cam-
pus staff who frequently go 
unaccredited and unnoticed, 
but are instrumental in mak-
ing our time here special. 
I’m propping open the door 
to our office for the first 
time in three years because 
I want the school to flood 
in and make this paper what 
it should have been a long 
time ago.
Sometimes I forget that 
I’m a student because of 
this newspaper, but then I’m 
reminded of that fact when 
I’m told about a mistake 
I’ve made. But pushing 
forward through criticism 
and sometimes downright 
cruel remarks is something 
I’ve learned to do because, 
like I said, this newspaper is 
held to a very high standard. 
As much as I like to think I 
am, I am not infallible, and 

I will make mistakes during 
my time as Editor-in-Chief. I 
say this not as an excuse, but 
because I want this school to 
understand that we at the ASP 
are people with real souls and 
(very) real student loans, that 
you can reach out to.
I can’t force people to be 
involved with this newspa-
per… no school paper will be 
everyone’s cup of tea. But I 
can ask, and give everyone a 
guarantee that this paper will 
become a part of the commu-
nity, as it should be. 
All I can really do is come 
at this school with an obnox-
ious enthusiasm that burns 
like 1,000 suns and hope that 
it will be returned, because 
your voices matter to us. I’m 
asking that we take this climb 
up the ladder together, and 
that you celebrate 100 years 
with us. At the end of the day, 
this is our home, and we’re 
all Great Danes.

guard because 
one of the point 
guards for the 
Swiss national 
team got hurt,” 
Evnas recalled. “That’s how I ended up 
playing for that team.” 
After a brief stint in the Swiss second di-
vision where he averaged 38 points a game, 
Evans was called up to the top league in 
Switzerland, and it was nothing like he ever 
experienced before, both on and off the 
court. 
“It was a different style of play. The 
tempo is pretty much the same but you 
have more experienced players,” Evans 
said. “You have a lot of guys who have 
been playing 10 plus years profession-
ally. The basketball IQ is pretty high. I’m 
quicker than a lot of guys, so I was able to 
dominate that way.” 
Off the court, the adjustment was a little 
more difficult. 
“It felt like another world. The food was 
different but I had to adjust. I learned to 
speak a little French by finding things I 
could eat and learning them,” Evans said. 
“The first day they were trying to give me 
horse but I denied it. I told them where I’m 
from, we don’t eat horse.” 
While his pro career was just getting 
started, Evans’ old team was making a run 

to remember. Evans’ good friend anwd for-
mer teammate Peter Hooley sent UAlbany 
to the NCAA Tournament with a buzzer 
beating shot that made national headlines. 
Evans was watching, and he couldn’t be 
more proud. 
“It was priceless,” Evans said of watch-
ing that shot. “I was pretty amped up. Just 
to see that and experience what I experi-
enced and see what those guys did. It was 
unbelievable.” 
Now, Evans is taking his talents to a 
place he has never been to before: Mo-
rocco. 
“It’s going to be a totally different 
culture and basketball atmosphere,” Evans 
said of his upcoming move to Africa. “I’m 
just excited to have the opportunity.” 
Evans’ season in Morocco starts soon, 
and whenever he puts on the uniform, he 
knows it probably won’t be worse than his 
final uniform at UAlbany. 
“The uniforms overseas are pretty dif-
ferent because they have all the sponsors. 
They find a way to put the sponsors on the 
shorts. I have a lot of words on my shorts,” 
he said. “It looks pretty weird, but I like 
them. They actually look better than the 
two-toned uniforms, I have to say.” 
Evans is leaving for Morocco this week. 
His former team’s season doesn’t start until 
November.

goal is to establish the best 
attacking combinations and apply 
pressure with versatility, pace and 
movement. The Danes scored an 
average of 1.11 goals per game 
last season. Sophomore forward 
Afonso Pinheiro, UAlbany’s big-
gest scoring threat after a team-
leading seven goals and sixteen 
points in 2014, will accompany 
junior midfielders Leo Melgar, 
who scored four goals and 10 
points in 19 matches, and Pedro 
Espindola, who scored a goal 
and two assists in 18 matches last 
season.
Junior goalkeeper Michael 
Pizzuto will take over the starting 
role in net after allowing 1.97 
goals per game and making 14 
saves in four starts a season ago. 
Redshirt sophomore Eric Orologio 
returns to the lineup after taking a 
redshirt season last year. 
Highlighted among the seven 
offseason additions is freshman 
Nico Solabarrieta, a product of 
Santiago, Chile, who has been in 
the Chilean youth national pool at 
numerous under-21 age groups. 
Solabarrieta’s dynamic scoring 
ability as an attacking forward 

brands him as a constant threat 
and immediate impact player in 
the fall, according to Gorman. 
Reid Conde, a freshman from 
Manchester, Vermont also joins 
the 2015 squad and presents a 
flexible option in the midfield. 
Conde is a two time all-state se-
lection from Vermont who tallied 
39 goals and 30 assists with Burr 
& Burton Academy and earned an 
invite to the U.S Soccer Training 
Center.
UAlbany is scheduled to play 
the three-time defending confer-
ence champions, the University 

of Maryland, Baltimore County 
Retrievers, on October 10 in Bal-
timore. The Danes are responsible 
for UMBC’s lone in-conference 
non-victorious result last season 
in a 1-1 double overtime tie. 
UMBC finished 6-0-1 in the 
America East last season, became 
the conference’s first team to 
reach the NCAA College Cup 
and finished 2014 ranked fourth 
in the country. The America East 
coaches consider UMBC one of 
the favorites to repeat for the title 
again this fall. UMBC has not lost 
an in-conference regular season 

match since October 2012 when 
the Danes won 2-1 at home. 
UAlbany will have its hands 
full in a competitive America 
East field, but Gorman is overtly 
confident in his experienced 
team’s ability to fight like dogs on 
the pitch.
“We have a lot of older players 
who have significant match expe-
rience from their career; that kind 
of experienced depth is something 
we consider a major strength,” 
said Gorman. “The college soccer 
season is an intense grind that’s 
very physically demanding. To 

have so many guys prepared to 
handle it is something I’m excited 
about.”
The schedule consists of match-
es at George Mason on September 
5, the 31st overall team in the 
NCAA Division I preseason rank-
ings, and at Syracuse on October 
6, who is ranked 15th overall. 
After a tough loss to Villanova 
in their first game, the Great 
Danes rebounded with a 1-0 win 
over Rhode Island on Sunday af-
ternoon to even their record with 
one win and one loss.

WOMEN’S SOCCER

The beginning of August for most col-
lege students is a time to squeeze in as 
many beach trips, barbeques, mini vacations 
and maybe even work shifts as possible. 
However, for many Division I athletes, the 
beginning of August means preseason.   
For those of you unfamiliar with what 
preseason is, it’s a period of time before the 
season starts to prepare the team for their 
upcoming season. For the University at Al-
bany women’s soccer team, the preseason 
began August 4. Preseason means many 
things to a college athlete, a time that is 
exciting because it sparks the beginning of 
the best time of the year, a time of endless 
nervousness over fitness tests and playing 
time, and for most of us, a combination of 
the two.
Since I am now a senior completing my 
final collegiate preseason, I thought I would 
share what the UAlbany campus is like 
weeks before the rest of the student body 
comes. 
Colonial Quad welcomed us with it’s 
overwhelming beauty. The 19th and 20th 
floor of the tower would be the UAlbany 
women’s soccer teams home away from 
home for the next two and a half weeks.
Our team all filed in on the fourth, 
freshman with their bags, school sup-
plies, mattress pads and entire Bed Bath & 
Beyond sets. The upperclassman traveled as 
minimalists, no mattress pads, no extensive 
wardrobe, basically a bag with cleats, shin 
guards and a pillow. 
Over the years you learn to rely on the 

underclassman to 
bring the fan, snacks, 
bathroom products, 
and other necessi-
ties. The first day of 
preseason usually is 
filled with meetings, 
gear issuing, and all 
the technicalities 
before playing can 
actually start. 
Bright and early 
the next day, the 
pressure of fitness 
testing becomes a 
reality. All teams do 
their testing differ-
ently, for the soccer 
team we have a 
test called SEBCO 
and the beep test. 
SEBCO was our first 
challenge this year. 
After SEBCO was 
completed the day was far from over; we 
had a juggling test a gap in our day and then 
an afternoon session. 
The schedule during preseason goes like 
this: Wake up early, eat a light breakfast in 
the locker room (which you will end up not 
being able to digest), practicing or running, 
lunch at Colonial Quad, if you’re lucky nap 
time on your uncomfortable bed, practice, 
dinner (again at Colonial Quad) and then 
the most highly anticipated and highly 
rewarding part of the day: bedtime. 
Campus is incredibly quiet during the 
preseason; at least until the football team 

comes. It is typically 
only athletes and occa-
sionally some summer 
programs occupying 
the facilities, making 
it a great transition for 
freshman and transfers 
who are just coming 
into their sport season 
and want to get accli-
mated to the campus.
It is always an 
overwhelming transi-
tion when the rest of 
the student body comes 
and you can no longer 
walk into the dining 
hall at any hour and be 
first in line for a wrap, 
or go from one side of 
campus to the other in 
five minutes. But even 
more difficult is going 
from completely being 
focused on your sport and team and having 
to go into school mode with all the course-
work required. 
   The women’s soccer team was in two-
a-day practices for about two weeks. We 
went through grueling practices, mentally 
taxing classroom and film sessions, testing 
and all the blood, sweat and tears required 
to be in full stride when the season starts.
Our goal is to win the America East 
Championship, and with this goal in mind 
since the end of our season last year we 
have had our head down, eyes set, and grind 
in tact to do so. 

Every year preseason is different, and 
most of this has to do with how the players 
have prepared and showed up. Our sum-
mer is a lot different than most of yours, we 
have to play soccer, we have to train and 
maintain fitness, and sometimes we have to 
make up classes that we couldn’t fit in our 
schedule in-season because of traveling and 
practice times.
There really isn’t an off time when you 
play a Division I sport. Summer is techni-
cally an off time. But when you’re working 
towards something like a championship, 
your summer becomes the key building 
block for post season success.
I would describe it as that constant feel-
ing of when you’re not training you feel 
the need to be training. The anticipation of 
preseason eats you up when it draws near, it 
digs at you in almost every situation: should 
I really be eating this? Drinking this? 
Should I go for another run? What are my 
teammates doing? 
For four years those have been my 
thoughts when preseason is around the 
corner, and then once it starts it’s one of the 
most mentally draining, physically reward-
ing and exciting times of my life.
I can’t say I will miss Colonial Quad or 
fitness tests at the crack of dawn. But I will 
miss the feeling of fighting for something 
so much bigger than I can describe here. 
We may not have the summer, bronzed 
tan like many students, but we do have a 
shin guard tan that marks a month of hard 
work to hopefully bring home a UAlbany 
women’s soccer championship for the first 
time in program history.

we need to 
improve in red 
zone defense, 
some critical 
indicators,” head coach Greg Gattuso said. 
“We’re a little bigger this year. We need to 
have a good year defensively. They need to 
step up.”
Two guys that the Great Danes need big 
efforts from on defense are Zach Troutman 
and Sam Gray, two of their defensive line-
men. Troutman, a 6-foot-3, 265-pound nose 
guard had 27 tackles last season, including 
two sacks. Gray, a 6-foot-5, 265-pound 
defensive tackle played in nine games last 
season, totaling 21 tackles. With most of 
UAlbany’s returning starters in the line-
backing corps and secondary, the play up 
will be crucial in 2015. 
“We have some really good rushers off 
the edge,” Gray said. “(Troutman and I) like 
to tear it up with our power on the inside. 
Our main focus is stopping the run, we want 
teams to try to beat us with their arm.”

Schedule Gauntlet
 UAlbany opens the season 
Saturday at University at Buffalo, the Great 
Danes’ first Division I Football Bowl Sub-
division opponent, and the aura around the 
locker room is that UAlbany could start the 
season with a huge upset. 

   “The kids are excited,” Gattuso said. 
“It would certainly be a big upset, you got 
a team that has 25 more scholarships. We’d 
certainly like to have a chance to win the 
game. (If it’s close) in the fourth quarter, 
who knows?”
   On top of playing Buffalo, the Great 
Danes face the top four opponents in the 
CAA from a year ago in New Hampshire, 
Villanova, James Madison and Richmond. 
The latter two are road trips for the Great 
Danes, who were 3-2 on the road last year. 
   “I love challenges,” Crook said. “In 
order to get your name out there, you’ve got 
to play big opponents.”

New Threads 
Last week, UAlbany unveiled new 
alternate uniforms to be worn during their 
home opener against Rhode Island on Sept. 
12. Injured tight end Nic Ketter was the 
model for the uniforms which consist of 
purple helmets with “UAlbany” in an arc. 
The jerseys are Nike’s anthracite gray with 
purple numbers and yellow outline to go 
with gray pants. 
“The kids want to wear them as soon 
as possible,” Gattuso said in a statement. 
“They’d probably wear them at Buffalo if 
I’d let them, but we’re going to wear them 
against Rhode Island and then probably 
another game later in the year.”

ALBANY STUDENT PRESS

By CARL STRAUT-COLLARD

   After finishing fifth in the 
America East last season, the 
University at Albany men’s soccer 
team will use its foundation of 
depth and maturity to its advan-
tage with 13 upper classmen and 
eight starters returning this fall.
Head coach Trevor Gorman 

stresses consistency and execution 
of the little things, two objectives 
he believes will factor into the 
team’s aspiring contentions for the 
America East crown and NCAA 
postseason. 
   “This group has largely been 
together for a number of years 
now. It’s a mature team that’s very 
close on and off the field,” said 

Gorman. “We believe we’re good 
enough to play against, and beat, 
anyone out there if we’re perform-
ing at our best. Embracing these 
types of challenges is the mark of 
a mature, motivated, team.”
   The departures of starting 
forward Brandon Wilson, starting 
defender Dominic McGarr and 
starting goalkeeper Tim Allen is 

not expected to hurt the team in 
the fall. Gorman admits last year’s 
seniors were great representatives 
of the program and its philosophy, 
but says replacing them is part of 
the process and their impact on the 
players returning will remain in 
the team’s identity. 
   Junior defenders Keith 
Traut, Bernardo Mattos and Luke 

Palmateer started every match last 
season and will lead the way for 
a Danes backfield that allowed 
1.26 goals per game in 2014. The 
defense continues to develop its 
overall shape, positioning and 
ability to give opposing offenses a 
challenge in penetrating.  
   Offensively, Gorman says the 

  

The last time DJ Evans stepped 
on the floor as a Great Dane, he 
had the game of his life. 
Listed at 5-foot-9, Evans was 
the smallest player on the court 
when the University at Albany 
played top ranked University of 
Florida in the second round of the 
NCAA Tournament on March 20, 
2014. 
In that game, Evans was the 

star. He finished with 21 points 
to lead all scorers as his college 
career ended with a 67-55 loss to 
the Gators in Orlando. 
His performance on the game’s 
biggest stage opened doors for 
Evans, and his performance was 
recognized for his grit and dedica-
tion. 
After that game, legend-
ary baseball star Chipper Jones 
tweeted, “Albany had a good 
game plan. Beat the press a lot and 

their point guard DJ Evans can 
play on my team any day.” 
Now, Evans is taking his game 
to the next level. After graduating 
in 2014, Evans recently began his 
professional career in Europe. 
In early 2015, Evans got an 
opportunity to play in Switzer-
land for Fribourg Olympic, and 
he jumped at the opportunity.  
“One day, I got a call from my 
agent that a team needed a point

University at Albany head coach Greg Gat-
tuso named DJ Crook the Great Danes starting 
quarterback for its season opener against Uni-
versity at Buffalo on Saturday. A new quarter-
back under center and an experienced defense 
will help bring a lot of attention to UAlbany 
football. 
Here’s five highlights for this year’s Great 
Danes:
1       

Experienced  
Offensive Line

       

An experienced offensive line will help Crook & Co. 
adapt and get into a rhythm. Four of five starters return 
in Kevin Malloy, Matt Campion, Tim Wade and Adam 
Wierbinski, and each was a part of a Great Danes rushing 
offense that averaged 140.8 yards per game.
“When the defense is running games and stuff like that 
you know what the guy next to you is doing,” Malloy said. 
“He feels the same thing you do because you guys are kind 
of connected.  The leadership of the offensive line hasn’t 
gone unnoticed by the coaching staff. The big guys upfront 
know they can make a huge impact on the production this 
year.
“The offensive line is really hungry to be leaders,” Gat-
tuso said. “They want the pressure on them. They took a lot 
of pride last year in the improvement of our running game, 
and our pass protection. They’re ready to be leaders, and 
I’m happy with them right now.”

Youth at Skill Positions 
    Offensively, the Great Danes will have a young, 
new look at the skill positions.  Crook, a sophomore 
transfer from Penn State, will replace UAlbany’s all-time 

leading passer, Will Fiacchi, at quarterback. 
UAlbany will have a new starting running back in junior 
Andre Martin, while Brad Harris and Josh Gontarek, two 
sophomores, will anchor the wide receivers, giving Crook a 
set of young skill players to grow and build chemistry with. 
“We’re young, yes, but we all know how to play ball,” 
Crook said. “It’s just a matter of getting used to each other. 
Me knowing where they’re going to be, and them knowing 
where I’m going to be throwing the ball.”
Gattuso is confident in his stable of running backs which 
includes redshirt freshman Elliot Croskey and redshirt 
junior Power Lawrence. 
“We feel we have depth (at running back),” Gattuso said. 
“Running back is one of those positions where a committee 
can work. Until someone separates themselves, it’s going to 
be hard to replace Omar (Osbourne).”
3            

Defensive Familiarity 
UAlbany returns eight starters on defense from a 
unit that forced 34 fumbles, recovering 20 of them, and 10 
interceptions. Anchored by redshirt junior middle lineback-
er Michael Nicastro, the Great Danes defense is confident 
in their ability to build on last year’s success. 
“The kids on defense know what to expect from the run-
ning back and skill positions in the CAA,” Nicastro said. 
“It’ll be a good year defensively, we got everybody back. A 
bunch of guys have good chemistry and everything.”
The focal points for the UAlbany defense will be forcing 
turnovers, stopping offenses on third down and getting to 
the quarterback. The Great Danes topped the CAA in take-
aways with 30, but ranked last in the CAA in opponent’s 
third-down conversion at 47.3 percent, and were eighth in 
sacks with 26. 
“We really need to improve in third-down conversion,
