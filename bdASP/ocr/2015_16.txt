UAlbany, Covered in Snow 

By LINDSEY RIBACK

The Honors College at the University of 
Albany has less than a 30 percent retention rate. 
The barriers: a minimum GPA requirement, 
courses that don’t apply to all majors, and overall 
confusion about the program. 
The Honors College, which began in the fall 
of 2006, refers to itself as a “community of 
developing scholars” on its homepage, http://
www.albany.edu/honorscollege/who_we_are.
php. Roughly 125 students are admitted to the 
program after they are accepted to UAlbany as 
high school seniors. The program also allows about 
35 freshman to apply during their first year and be 
admitted as sophomores. As part of this smaller 
community, students must complete 18 credits of 
Honors College courses during their first two years 
- 12 if they were admitted as sophomores - and 
submit an original thesis at the end of their senior 
year, which they will research and write under the 

advisement of a UAlbany professor. 
According to Leslie Halpern, the interim director 
of the Honors College and an associate professor 
of psychology, the program typically has 140 
students each academic year. However, only about 
40 students will actually graduate from the Honors 
College come senior year.
She believes that the low retention rate is highly 
attributable to the thesis requirement which is both 
time consuming to write and difficult for students 
to accomplish, who have to seek out a faculty 
member and research a project that interests them.
To combat this, Halpern is working with 
Jaclyn Napoleon, the senior assistant director of 
Undergraduate Admissions, and Anita Hanson, the 
academic advisor for the Honors College. 
Napoleon coordinates the Honors College 
Ambassadors, a group of Honors College students 
who return to their respective high schools during 
the winter and spring breaks with the hopes of

AROUND UALBANY

By STEFAN LEMBO-STOLBA

An intimate group filled the 
Rotunda in Albany’s City Hall 
last Tuesday to celebrate Black 
History Month with a showcase 
of one of the city’s most historic 
black enclaves: Rapp Road. 
The interactions of the 
audience were not characteristic 
of a publicly held event at a city 
building. Members of the crowd 
embraced each other in a manner 
akin to a family reunion. By 
5 p.m. all of the 50 seats were 
filled. It would soon become 
clear that much of the crowd was 
family —some by blood, and 
some through the historic culture 
of the Rapp Road community. 
Following the movements of 
the Great Migration in the 1920s, 
Rev. Louis Parson of Shubuta, 
Mississippi bought 14 acres of 
land on Rapp Road in the Pine 
Bush section of Albany. Over 
the next several decades Parson 
grew the community, transporting 
black migrants from Shubuta, 
making Rapp Road a home 
away from home for a struggling 
southern population. 
The Rapp Road Historic 
Association (RRHA) is a group 
that was founded to honor 
Parson’s work in creating the 
Rapp Road community, and has 
taken great strides to ensure that 
Rapp Road would properly be 
acknowledged for its historic 
significance. 
In conjunction with the New 
York State Museum, the RRHA 
has created an exhibit on the Rapp 
Road community, which is on 
display in the lobby of Albany’s

Beverly Bardequez speaking at an event on Rapp Road on Aug. 15, 2015.

City Hall for Black History Month. 
Beverly Bardequez, president of the 
RRHA, and F. Maxine Fantroy-Ford, 
a second-generation resident of Rapp 
Road both spoke at the event. Both 
women shared fond memories of the 
community’s history throughout the 
past 60 years. 
Bardequez and Fantroy-Ford spoke 
about their personal experiences in the 
community, and why it is important that 
Rapp Road be placed in the forefront 
of the city’s focus. Bardequez referred 
to the community as an “endangered 
species,” and represented her work with 
the RRHA as her “fight to keep the little 
community in tact.” 
Fantroy-Ford read excerpts from 
her memoirs, including her accounts 
of the Rapp Road community and her 
experience of growing up in such a 
unique enclave of Albany. 
“Some people called it the country… 
sometimes there would be a pig or two 

in the road,” she said. 
In 2002, with the help of activists 
and community members, Rapp Road 
was officially registered as a national 
historic district, according to the 
National Park Service. The significance 
of this designation resonated that night, 
as this national recognition is a formal 
acknowledgement of Rapp Road’s 
historic value.  
Over several decades, the Rapp Road 
community has steadily decreased 
in size. Of the 28 families that have 
lived on Rapp Road, only 12 remain, 
according to Bardequez. The sharp 
decrease in population raises concerns 
for the neighborhood as properties 
deteriorate and developers sweep 
through the area, purchasing large 
swaths of land.
The story of Rapp Road aims to 
serve a greater purpose in Albany. In 
a closing conversation Pastor Richard 
Parson, the nephew of the community’s 
founder Louis Parson, summed-up their 
objective saying, “We want to keep 
the story alive… and recognize our 
forefathers and where they brought us 
from.”

With just a week under his belt as the new Vice 
President of Information Technology Services and 
CIO, Dr. Simeon Ananou took a break from his hectic 
schedule to discuss with the Albany Student Press how 
he became interested in the field of higher education 
and to discuss his future at the University at Albany. 

ASP: What prompted you to take the job here at 
UAlbany?

Simeon Ananou: What I would refer to as 
professional and personal growth, combined with the 
university’s mission as articulated by the president in 
the four stakes that he has laid out… UAlbany is an 
institution that is on the rise. I remember after my first 
executive committee meeting with the president and 
colleagues, picking up the phone and calling my wife 
to tell her how pleased and thrilled I am to have been 
chosen to be part of this institution. 

ASP: You’ve had a lot of different jobs in a lot of 
different places. Which were your favorites?

SA: Higher education is a small community. I’m 
proud to have been affiliated with all the institutions 
that are listed in my bio. The one not listed is Ohio 
State University, my alma mater, where I obtained 
my undergraduate degree and went on to work for 
a number of years. I was given the foundations of 
what it means to connect information technology to 
educational outcomes…I’ve been very proud of my 
interactions with the student community. Tangible 
accomplishments, which in my mind, have resulted in 
improving the lives of the students. 

ASP: Will you be looking to implement things from 
earlier in your career to your current position? 

SA: I don’t want to simply show up and start 
implementing things because they look good or 
because that’s what I’m used to. I am going to be 
very intentional in the technologies that we choose 

to implement. I know research is a very important 
component of this institution and I am already in 
contact with Vice President for Research, Dr. Jim 
Diaz…The questions I am asking are to identify how 
each request I receive is going to improve the learning 
outcomes for our students, or make this institution 
better in terms of research and community engagement. 
When a request comes to my attention that can be 
linked to any of those priorities, in my mind it is a very 
important request to take. 

ASP: You have a hectic schedule, what does or what 
will a typical day entail for you?

SA: I have the best job on campus. On a typical day 
I will be having a conversation with an academic dean 
to explore technologies that can attract the students 
into a particular program of discipline and help them 
graduate. Or, I could be       having a conversation with 
one of my own team members about a particular project 
that is currently underway related to information 
security and how we are going to improve the 
university.

ASP: Besides having the best job on campus, what 
else do you like about Albany?

SA: Being in the Capital Region is something 
that I find fascinating… I am a small town person 
and Albany is going to be one of the largest places I 
have lived in many years. Being centrally located is 
something I really enjoy, knowing I can get to those 
metropolitan areas fairly quickly, but I can return to 
the Capital Region to enjoy the quiet nature of Albany. 
Also, I love to golf and I enjoy cross-country skiing 
when the weather is appropriate, and I think I’ve landed 
at a place where I can enjoy those two hobbies nicely. 

ASP: What else do you enjoy doing in your spare 
time?

SA: I spend a lot of time in the kitchen. I love to 
cook... My wife is French so there are things I have 
picked up from the French culture and one of them 

is the cuisine. Cooking is something I find to be very 
relaxing, especially in this transition where I am by 
myself while my family is still in Maryland. 

ASP: Are there any changes you would like to see at 
UAlbany?

SA: As I talk to people on campus, I anticipate that 
there will be a transformation of some sort in the very 
near future. We have untapped potential in information 
technology. I will continue the discussion to see how 
we can initiate a transformation of some sort to be able 
to tap those potentials better.

ASP: Did you grow up in Ohio as well?

SA: Yes I did… My father was a university 
professor, so now you can connect the dots as to why I 
have a passion for higher education. I often joke that I 
knew the difference between a department chair and a 
dean when I was four years old. 

ASP: Did you always know you wanted to go into 
higher education?

SA: No. I went to Ohio State as a Battelle Institute 
Scholar, with an interest in electrical engineering, 
hoping that I was going to make a chip that would make 
computers or electronic devices. It wasn’t long into my 
undergraduate years when I applied for a student job in 
a research lab on campus. I was a freshman. They gave 
me a broom and asked me to clean the lab because they 
didn’t have anything else that a student would normally 
do. I was very persistent and eventually they started 
giving me technical projects and I became exposed to 
the IT organization…The irony is that I came to work 
in higher education information technology, while I 
was still exposed to the liberal arts degree and that gave 
me a completely different perspective.

recruiting graduating seniors to the UAlbany program. 
The thesis requirement is one of the main concerns she 
has noticed among incoming freshman, and she tries to 
put it into perspective. 
“‘I’ll say, ‘Listen you’re a freshman now, this is three 
years down the road. You’ll get the support that you 
need and the resources you’ll need to make you feel like 
wow I can do a thesis,’” Napoleon said. 
While the resources that Napoleon mentioned 
are available, many students are unsure of how to 
obtain them. To improve this, Halpern is currently in 
the process of working with Hanson to refine their 
developmental advising model. This model will allow 
Hanson to continue to advise Honors College students 
throughout all four years, working as a supplemental 
counselor to the advisor for their major, which will 
hopefully guide them in the right direction when it 
comes to the thesis. 
“A big part of what we are going to ask her to do is to 
act as the liaison to departments to help them [students] 
find research mentors for junior year,” Halpern said. 
Another issue the interim director is looking to 
address within the next year is better integration of 
Honors College courses with the honors classes specific 
to academic majors. 
Andrea Sanfilippo, a sophomore double majoring in 
financial analysis and accounting, made the decision to 
withdraw from the Honors College upon realizing she 
would not be able to fulfill both her Honors College 
requirements and those for the honors programs in her 
majors. 
 “I had no time to spare taking [Honors College] 
classes not applicable to my majors,” said Sanfilippo, 
who was initially drawn to the program because of its 
smaller community within the university. “Also the fact 
that it is unclear if students can double-count [the thesis] 
or not shows that there is a lack of communication.”
Halpern hopes that the lack of clarity and contact 
between the academic departments themselves and the 
students will be ironed out within the next year so that 
“the Honors College will improve and grow. That’s 
always the goal, to enrich the experience.” 

Connor Murphy / Albany Student Press
Some students feel constrained by the Honors College requirements, saying that they can’t fit their majors’ honors 
classes in addition to the Honors College’s classes.

e are now capable of simulating 
tragedies through technology.
Video games make the 
realistically impossible virtually possible. 
Video games enable people to create worlds 
where the imagination can roam free. 
However, not all video games nowadays are 
made to entertain. 
“That Dragon, Cancer” is a memoir-
style game developed by Ryan Green 
that simulates the experience of his infant 
son, Joel Green, who was diagnosed with 
cancer. The game itself has restrained 
controls, limiting the player on what they 
can manipulate and what decisions they can 
make. 
Nevertheless, the point of this game is 
to tell Green’s story. Its intentions don’t 
align with the essence of escapism, which is 
what most games follow. With this unique 

take, the evolution of technology is being 
exploited through his video game, creating a 
more practical use of technology.
The game is also just as beneficial. 
It’s essential in the name of expression. 
Ultimately, this game is dedicated to 
Green’s son. 
“We needed to find something we could 
do as Joel’s parents, since we could not heal 
him,” Green said to theguardian.com.
Video games do allow a degree of 
escapism for people, to distract oneself from 
the harsh reality. Escapism does benefit 
society, as life can get too hard and people 
need a distraction. However, “That Dragon, 
Cancer” strips video games’ association 
with escapism, revealing that video games 
aren’t solely forms of entertainment. 
This game will be revolutionary as it’s 
capturing an emotional experience and 
reveals the true evil of cancer. 
Admittedly, the overall concept of 

this game may seem overwhelming. 
Alyssa Hathaway, a psychology major 
at the University at Albany said, “[It’s] 
a little morbid, its intentions were good, 
its execution not so good… I feel like 
it’s a virtual reality, it’s making light of 
something serious, it’s not a joke, you don’t 
put yourself in that situation.” 
It may seem as though the game is 
exploitive of cancer, however we can’t 
overlook its context. 
“That Dragon, Cancer” is the closest 
experience to living with cancer or having 
a loved one with cancer anyone can get. It 
emphasizes the idea that life is intended to 
be amazing and one should not take any 
moment for granted. Some people are less 
fortunate than others.
These memoir games open the minds of 
people. It allows people to feel the epitome 
of empathy.
This game isn’t alone in its category. It 

is a breakthrough, but other memoir-like 
games exist. For instance, “Freshmen Year” 
by Nina Freeman creates the experience of a 
woman being sexually harassed while going 
to a bar. This genre of video games takes 
“stepping into someone else’s shoes” to the 
next level. 
And even though no one is eager to 
simulate these types of scenarios, they 
weren’t created to be fun because they 
aren’t fun. Video games give people the 
opportunity to pose as characters that have 
no consequences. And it’s nice to make your 
character jump off a cliff, as it can respawn, 
but now video games are capable of creating 
real-life experiences. 
They can broaden our understanding on 
certain experiences, experiences that people 
have to face in life. And unlike other games 
that treat death so loosely, this game takes 
death seriously. There is no respawning in 
real life.

The updated UAlbany app

By MILO VOTAVA
F

or the first time since its debut in 
2014, the University at Albany’s 
mobile app, available on both 
Apple and Android devices, recieved 
a much-needed update on Jan. 14. 
Besides changing the home screen from 
a tiled menu of different features to a 
background image of the main campus’s 
iconic fountains, the developers added 
some much-needed changes to the app. 
However, while it’s a lot better than it 
was, the app has a long way to go to be 
truly helpful.  
All the options are still there, but the 
way users access them has changed. To 
get to them now, users need to press the 
smaller list option in the upper left corner. 
All the options can now be found on a list 
that appears on the left side of the screen, 
overlaying the image of the fountains. This 
is a rather annoying feature since users 
cannot get out of this menu unless they 
press the home button on the bottom of the 
screen, but some students find the aesthetic 
appeal of the background image worth the 
struggle.

The UAlbany app also allows students 
to log on with their MyUAlbany account 
username and password. This gives 
students the option to check things such 
as their GPA and schedule straight from 
the app. However, this feature can also 

be annoying because it logs users off if 
the user closes the app, but not if the user 
switch tabs on their phone. 
One of the nicest options that the newly 
updated app has is a ribbon at the bottom 
of the screen. Its position is fixed, and 

even navigating to other pages of the 
app will not take it off the screen. This 
can be a problem, especially since users 
can’t get back to the previous page if they 
accidentally press the home button. 
The ribbon does have easy access to the 
features that UAlbany students used most 
on the original version of the app, like 
the CDTA bus schedule and the laundry 
application, which lets students check if the 
dryers in their building are available. 
Overall, the app feels like it’s more 
focused on aesthetics than function. While 
it looks a lot more streamlined, modern, 
and is a great improvement from what it 
used to be, some of the menu functions are 
more of a hindrance than an improvement.  
It is nice to see that the app creator 
listened to the suggestions he received from 
its users, and that he seems truly committed 
to giving all the relevant information about 
campus to those who need it. However, 
they have missed some essential functions 
like being able to access email. The next 
update should focus more on the functions 
of the app, and streamlining them to be 
easier to use, instead of focusing on how 
the app looks.

eligion and politics are two words that, when put 
together, make most Americans cringe. The issue 
of politicians leading with their religious values 
is a point of contest that summons the question: 
“What about separation of church and state?” 
Since this nation was established, religious rhetoric 
has found a way to creep into American culture and 
government. From “In God We Trust” to the Pledge of 
Allegiance, the word God infiltrates all levels of society. 
Unintentionally, phrases like “God bless you” and “God 
forbid” have been ingrained into our culture. These phrases 
aren’t inclusive, as some candidates are blatantly referring 
to Christianity.
God is not only ingrained into American culture but is 
also openly embraced by an overwhelming majority of the 
population. According to a report by the Pew Research 
Center, more than 70 percent of Americans identified as 
Christian in 2014. This statistic highlights the unbalanced 
proportion of Christians in the United States, which then 
influences the political elections. In fact, according to 
Pewforum.org, Protestants alone made up 53 percent of the 
2014 electorate.
The hope for any election should be to select candidates 
based on their policies and their ability to affect change. 

Unfortunately, with Christianity so deeply woven into our 
culture, the simple task of choosing a political candidate 
becomes blurred by religion. With the vast majority of 
the United States sympathetic to Christianity, politicians 
cater to the religious sectors of the electorate through the 
use of God in their rhetoric. In doing so, they identify their 
personal religious views in elections. 
On a simple level, this inclusion of God in political 
rhetoric consists of “God bless America” after public 
speeches, claiming that you pray before meals and attend 
church every Sunday. Simple uses of God in political 
speech are to appease the average American Christian 
citizen. And it works, as Christianity and the United States 
culture are basically intermingled.
When George W. Bush was president, the use of 
religious rhetoric in politics bypassed the casual use of 
“God bless America.” Instead, Bush started the wars in 
Afghanistan and Iraq after God told him, “George, go fight 
these terrorists in Afghanistan… George, go and end the 
tyranny in Iraq,” according to a report by Nabil Shaath, a 
Palestinian foreign minister. Uses of religious rhetoric like 
this bring personal religious views too far into the public 
and, in this case, global sphere, deviating from secular 
government, which is expected in a nation built of diverse 
immigrants with diverse religions. 
In this year’s presidential election, it is evident that 

candidates have not abandoned their effort to sweet-talk 
the large number of evangelical voters. Donald Trump 
recently received an endorsement from “one of the 
evangelical community’s biggest names,” Jerry Falwell 
Jr., according to a report by The Washington Post. Trump 
has briefly spoken about his religious views, stating he has 
“a great relationship with God” and that the Bible is his 
“favorite book.” Trump has also gone on record stating 
that he wants “a total and complete shutdown of Muslims 
entering the United States” in one of his common outbursts 
of xenophobia. 
In contrast to Trump, Bernie Sanders, the Democratic 
socialist, announced that he is “not actively involved with 
organized religion,” according to an interview with The 
Washington Post. If elected Sanders would not only be 
the first Jewish president, but a president who does not 
incorporate religious rhetoric into his political display. 
It is with this pivotal presidential election that we will 
see the direction our nation is heading in. Regardless 
of who is elected, if either Trump or Sanders end up 
in the White House, we may see the nation come to a 
religious crossroad: one being political secularity, the 
other being political bigotry. Regardless of which road is 
taken, it seems as though the nation will react in favor of 
inclusiveness, thus slipping away from the stronghold of 
conventional Christianity.

Are presidential candidates being religiously inclusive?

Presidential candidates should practice being more inclusive religiously. Some candidates put an emphasis on the representation of Christianity, which limits their 
connection to the American population.

dmit it, we love porn—well, at least 
those of us who actually watch it 
love it. However, things can get a 
bit distasteful as we look at the facts 
and logistics on what goes on behind the 
scenes in the porn industry.  
The porn industry is one of the most 
prolific and fascinating phenomenon. It 
caters to adults, both male and female, 
spanning several ages. It is inclusive to 
people of all ethnicities: It is essentially a 
menu of whatever turns one on.  
However, despite the growth and 
advancements in the porn industry, 
racial fetishization and racism are still 
widespread and prevalent. 
In pornography, minority women are 
most commonly fetishized and categorized 
by racial stereotypes. For instance, Asian 
women are continuously showcased as 
submissive and subservient to their male 
counterparts. Latinas are almost always 
labeled feisty, “hot and spicy” or “sexy 
senoritas.” Black women are always 
portrayed as aggressive, demanding and 
even “extremely ghetto,” as porn star Misty 
Stone puts it. 
The porn industry also plays into 
stereotypes of minority women as they 
always have a specific role within each 
individual ethnic group. A scene with a 
Hispanic woman would typically involve 
the Hispanic woman being a maid. When 
a black woman is on camera, she would 

be portrayed as a thug, or the aggressive, 
dominant type. Some videos featuring a 
black woman are labeled as “Black ghetto 
girl…” whereas when an Asian woman is 
filmed, she is either a masseuse in a silky 
kimono or an innocent schoolgirl, waiting 
for a command.  
In contrast, when white women are 
filmed, they play roles such as doctors, 
lawyers, teachers or other high status 

professions.
“The porn industry makes money from 
fetishizing minorities.  There’s no way 
around it. They sell this fictionalized idea 
on what minorities [are] and it affects 
how men perceive many women around 
the world,” said Maria Pareja Borsic, a 
University at Albany senior. 
In addition to minority women being 
fetishized, they are also some of the lowest 

paid actresses in the industry. Specifically, 
black women are currently paid the least, 
with Latinas and Asian women following.  
Similarly, minority men are also negatively 
portrayed, some of whom are not even 
given enough time on camera. Asian men, 
to be specific, are rarely in pornographic 
films, unless it is with another Asian 
actress. Asian men are also portrayed as 
weak or docile. Contrary to Asian men are 
black men in porn who, most of the time, 
are portrayed as aggressive thugs.
To make matters worse, white actresses 
demand higher salaries when they are 
asked to perform with a black man. 
In an interview for The Daily Show, 
porn star Lisa Ann said, “White girls will 
ask for double, triple and even quadruple 
to do an interracial scene,” and when they 
reject the offer to shoot with a black man, 
they say things like, “My parents don’t 
want me to do interracial.”
Today, the porn industry may appear 
to be racially inclusive, as it does include 
people of all colors.  However, it is 
continuously showing racial biases and 
stratification through its portrayal of 
women of color and how it pays them. 
“Although the porn industry has the 
diversity needed to entertain the whole 
ethnic spectrum, it is heavily stereotyped 
and that results in negative preconceived 
notions [of] women in different ethnic 
groups,” said Brent De Leon, a UAlbany 
sophomore.

RACIAL ISSUES

Porn industries reinforce racial stereotypes in order to please their viewers. In 
doing so they fetishize races, clouding the cultural value they have.

By MILO VOTAVA 

Isaac Chueke, professional Brazilian 
conductor, came to the University at 
Albany on Wednesday, Feb. 10 to host a 
talk about the history and importance of 
Brazilian music and culture . Chueke, who 
trained in music in four countries, said he 
“symbolically has a music degree in four 
countries,” though he got his doctorate of 
music in Paris. 
 Born in Rio de Janeiro, Chueke’s life 
started out musical, as it was an important 
part of his family life. However, his family 
considered music to be a hobby, not a 
profession. He had to fight them to be able 
to study what he loved. This led Chueke to 
cultivate an independent nature early on. 
His parents’ opinion on his profession 
has improved over time. In fact, Chueke 
seems to be highly motivated by his family. 
One of his most moving memories of 
performing was when his wife, a pianist, 
and his daughter, a singer, performed 
with him. Though they all have their own 
careers, he said that it was nice to be able to 
bring his family and music together. 
Besides his family, Chueke is also 
inspired by his home country of Brazil. 
He feels a personal responsibility to teach 
others about the country. He enjoys being 
a kind of ambassador for the diverse music 
that comes out of Brazil. This was what 
he focused on during his talk: the music 
of Brazil, how it evolved over time and its 
historical significance. 
 Chueke seemed to not mind that there 
was a rather low turnout at his seminar. In 
fact, he seemed happy to be able to reach 
out to more people personally. Chueke 
talked about the history of Brazil, especially 
how the country was under military rule 

in the 1960s, and how music was not only 
a form of entertainment but also a way 
to express yourself and rebel against the 
government. 
The language of Brazil has been 
Portuguese for hundreds of years but it was 
influenced by the many different cultures 
introduced to Brazil. Chueke believed 
that “language gives music impressions 
and rhythm, and a general impression that 
makes it different.” He also went over 
different types of traditional Brazilian 
instruments. 
Chueke then brought up some sound 
clips of various traditional and modern 
music. Two of the clips that stood out the 
most were a traditional violin piece, then 
the same traditional piece but remixed 
with faster electronic bass beats. The 
juxtaposition of the same piece in such 
different styles was nice to hear, and 
showed how the history of traditional music 
is not lost in the modern age. This also 
carries over to traditional dances, such as 
the samba schools that have annual parades 
and competitions, of which Chueke showed 
us some videos. The entire event is focused 
on how Brazil still honors its past while 
continuing to progress. 
The event ended with Chueke having 
everyone clap along to the beat of another 
traditional song. Throughout the entire 
experience, I was touched by how kind 
Chueke is. He shook everyone’s hands 
with a strong grip when they went to 
talk to him. He listened to everyone, 
asking them questions, and he seemed 
genuinely interested. For someone of such 
international prominence, he was humble, 
and welcoming to everyone. He brought not 
only the culture, but the spirit of Brazil with 
him, with his attitude and personality.

Hands Like Houses release 
powerful new rock album

REVIEW 

By AIDEN BEAN 

Australian rock group Hands Like Houses has never been 
one to stray away from a challenge. Their past two releases, 
“Ground Dweller” (2012) and “Unimagine” (2013), have 
pushed the boundaries of alternative rock and post-hardcore 
while still holding on to those anthemic choruses and peppy 
instrumentation, ensuring them lifelong success not only in 
small punk clubs, but potentially bigger arenas as well. All 
this hard work and steadfast dedication has finally resulted 
in the strongest album of their career. 
“Dissonants” sets a high bar for many other alternative 
bands to follow and likely fail. It takes everything great 
from their first two releases and uses these elements to 
create an album largely devoid of filler, resulting in an 
album screaming with memorable hooks, powerful vocals 
and authentic instrumentation from many genres. In a 
perfect world, this album would be Hands Like Houses big 
break. 
Album opener and first single, “I Am,” is the first of 
many anthemic choruses about outcasts and rebellion, a 
fairly clichéd lyrical topic, but Hands Like Houses writes 
them so well. Also evident on this track, unlike those from 
their past releases, is a hardcore-influenced breakdown that 
rears its head throughout most of the other tracks on this 
record. The guitars are in the forefront on this one, finally 
giving Matt Cooper and Alexander Pearson the opportunity 
to show off just a little bit past the genre norms. 
“Perspectives” is the perfect follow-up and an almost 
pristine example of a one-two punch. Electronica influences 

are few and far between, astonishing considering that 
this band was once labeled as “electronicore.” Listeners 
can tell the band is truly aiming for something different, 
long-lasting and memorable past the first few listens. 
With another exciting breakdown in this track, the heavy 
influences are intact but the chorus screams, “Put me on the 
radio” in the best way possible.
Their most recent single, “Colourblind,” is the highlight 
of the record. A perfect representation of their influences, 
this one moves through a Linkin Park-inspired intro, 
Jonny Craig-sounding verses, a huge pop punk chorus, 
an atmospheric middle section and an almost djent-styled 
breakdown. Mid-tempo track “Glasshouse” showcases the 
group’s technicality in the intro which leads to a crushing 
breakdown. An element that may shock core fans on this 
tune, and a couple others throughout the album, is the 
emphasis on drum-and-bass styled patterns, particularly 
on verses. However, unlike the trend in EDM music, 
Hands Like Houses’ style of drum-and-bass is 100 percent 
authentic and leads to a much fuller sound.
While the first half of the record was predominantly 
heavy, the second half showcases the group’s ability to 
meld various genres, particularly pop, into their hard-
rocking sound. 
“Division Symbols” has the most memorable chorus 
on the record and, if slowed down, could pass off as a 
late ’90s Backstreet Boys track. “Momentary” bends 
genres into R&B and may leave listeners wondering if 
it’s Justin Bieber they’re hearing. But he track is no love 
song or acoustic jam - the chorus still hits like a thousand 
bricks. “Motion Sickness” has a spine-shivering bridge 

and buildup, with emotionally strained vocals courtesy of 
Trenton Woodley—who has really come into his own on 
this record, often wowing the listener with vocal trickery 
and powerful pipes—and an interesting instrumentation, 
featuring the first guitar solo on the record.
As technically interesting and powerfully hard-
hitting as this record truly is, there are only two slight 
disappointments in the form of single “New Romantics” 
and later album track “Grey Havens.” “New Romantics” 
simply relies on everything Hands Like Houses is good at, 
breaking no true new ground and relying on the simplistic 
moments from many of their past songs. Other than an 
industrial-sounding and fairly interesting breakdown, “Grey 
Havens” is the same deal. A typical second-half filler track, 
the song doesn’t stand out and gets lost in the onslaught of a 
fairly long and adventurous album. On their own, these two 
songs would probably stand out as some of the best rock 
songs of this year.
Hands Like Houses never fails to disappoint but this is 
when we’ve finally seen them transform from post-hardcore 
little leagues to arena rock. Not many bands can rock a 
heavy sound and counteract that with influences ranging 
from pop to punk to R&B. Bands with this amount of 
diversity and intrigue are the ones who are usually capable 
of producing not only genre-shifting records from here on 
out, but also booking those bigger gigs, expanding their fan 
base, getting on the radio and bringing their sound to the 
mainstream. With “Dissonants,” a frankly astounding, well-
thought-out, well-produced, authentic, real and interesting 
alternative rock record, Hands Like Houses has finally 
crossed that barrier.

DEADPOOL DONE RIGHT 

FILM REVIEW 

By ELENA POLLACK 

If a shady guy in a shady bar hands you a shady business 
card and offers you a shady deal of becoming “better than 
better,” maybe you should walk away.
Ajax (Ed Skrein), the man behind the “shady” business 
card, has no intention of helping Wade Wilson, played by 
Ryan Reynolds. Wilson is a mercenary who is fighting for 
the little guy. He is no superhero. But when he’s diagnosed 
with terminal cancer, he will do anything to save himself, 
and therefore save his love, Vanessa (Morena Baccarin), 
from dying with him. 
But Ajax turns Wilson into a self-regenerating mutant, 
permanently deforming his skin. After developing these 
powers, Wilson takes on the vigilante-like name of 
Deadpool and tracks down Ajax, intending to both heal 
himself and kill the man who tortured him and hundreds of 
others for profit.
This two-hour movie was hilarious, bloody, and 
downright sexual. Reynolds does a fantastic job of 
portraying the childish, sexual and utterly crazy person that 

is the Merc with a Mouth. The character himself is very 
close to his comic rendition, written by Fabian Nicieza 
in 1991. He is inappropriate, deadly, childish, loves to 
kill, and continuously breaks the fourth wall by speaking 
directly to the audience several times throughout the film.
The action scenes were thrilling, but not too bloody or 
over the top. The fighting was good, although not entirely 
realistic. The humor was the best part. With references to 
other movies in the comic world, witty one-liners, sexual 
references and well-timed jokes, from the very first credits 
to the time the lights went up, no one in the theater could 
breathe for laughter. One of my favorite scenes was when 
Deadpool finally asked for help. He made a few allusions 
to some other movies and left me dying of laughter in my 
seat. As always, the beloved Stan Lee made a cameo in this 
movie.
On the romantic side of things, one could say it was 
a romantic comedy, in that Wilson’s goal was to avenge 
himself and find a cure so he could return to Vanessa. There 
is a damsel, who might not be much of a damsel, and there 
is lots of love—R-rated love, that is. I was apprehensive 

about the romantic aspects as the character is not supposed 
to be a very romantic person, but it worked. The romantic 
plot wasn’t too cheesy, and fit in nicely with the rest of 
the movie. The director, Tim Miller, rather than make the 
love interest a sweet and innocent girl who tries to save the 
“villain,” made Vanessa Wilson’s perfect match.
Two other characters in the X-Men universe made 
an appearance: Negasonic Teenage Warhead (Brianna 
Hildebrand) and Colossus (Stefan Kapicic). While the film 
introduced the former, the latter had already been portrayed 
by Daniel Cudmore in “X2,” “X-Men: The Last Stand” and 
“X-Men: Days of Future Past.” Colossus was definitely 
a hero and Negasonic lived up to her name as a teenager. 
These two X-Men attempt to recruit Deadpool as a 
superhero and then join in for the big finale. Unfortunately, 
we don’t get to see any other X-Men in this film, but one 
can only hope this new character will make appearances in 
the films to come.
Overall the film’s portrayal of this comic book legend 
did not disappoint. This was certainly Deadpool done right.

Coldplay, Bruno Mars, and Beyoncé 
unite for Super Bowl’s 50th halftime 

HALFTIME SHOW 

By AMANDA CASE

Chris Martin and his band Coldplay headlined the 2016 
Super Bowl Halftime Show, held at Levi’s Stadium on 
Sunday, Feb. 7, in Santa Clara, California. 
The show started with Martin on the field, surrounded 
by fans, running and singing Coldplay’s hit song “Viva 
La Vida.” Then, he hopped onstage with his band and 
performed “Paradise” and their new tune “Adventures of a 
Lifetime.” 
A marching band dressed in luminous yellow and pink 
uniforms surrounded either side of the stage and dancers 
twirled around brightly-colored flower umbrellas during 
Coldplay’s last two songs. The stadium radiated a plethora 
of colors from the audience and the performers, and the 
stage itself doubled as a video screen, pulsing with a 
whirlwind of colors under Martin and his band as they 
played.  
But it might have been Beyoncé and Bruno Mars 
who stole the show. Martin introduced Mars, who was 
accompanied by dancers and DJ Mark Ronson. Dressed in 
all black, wearing gold chains around their necks, Mars and 
his crew performed his hit “Uptown Funk.” He worked his 
way around the stage during his whimsical performance, 
showing off his funky dance moves.  
The excitement elevated as Beyoncé popped on the field 
to debut her new single “Formation.” She was surrounded 
by an army of dancers and a drumline. Beyoncé fiercely 
strutted her way to the stage where she and Mars faced off 
in a soulful battle, mixing their two songs together. Martin 
reappeared and the trio finished “Uptown Funk.” 
The pace slowed down as Martin jumped on the piano 
and played “Fix You.” The stage displayed a tribute video 
of numerous past halftime shows under their feet while 
Martin serenaded the crowd. 
Once again, Mars and Beyoncé came together to join 
Martin to declare “We’re gonna get together somehow,” 
ending the show singing “Up and Up.” Martin also tossed 
in lyrics by U2, Prince and Mars himself. At the end of 
the performance, fireworks and sparklers shot up from 
the edges of the field and the audience held up signs that 

spelled out the words “Believe in Love.” It was a high-
spirited moment as everyone was unified through the 
music.
There are questions, though, of what the true nature of 
the performance was about. It was obvious that Coldplay 
was trying to promote love, but some believe they were 
also standing up for gay marriage because of the colorful 
scheme throughout the stadium and some fans waving 
rainbow flags. 
It is also up for debate whether the performers were 
trying to break down racial barriers. But Beyoncé 
seemed to cause a stir because she and her back-up 

dancers wore outfits reminiscent of the Black Panthers, a 
revolutionary black nationalist and socialist organization 
active in the United States from 1966 until 1982.
However, Beyoncé and Mars still may have outshined 
Martin in almost every way. They worked the stage and 
the crowd in an electrifying fashion that mild-mannered 
Coldplay might have lacked. And as if Queen B didn’t 
dominate the show enough by debuting a new song and 
making a political statement, she also announced that she 
will be heading on a world tour this spring.
So while the stage was eccentric and the atmosphere 
nostalgic, Martin’s overall performance was 
underwhelming and left something more to be desired. 
Maybe bringing out two of the most memorable halftime 
show veterans was the wrong way to go. Fans were also left 
scratching their heads, wondering why Martin and Beyoncé 
didn’t sing Coldplay’s track “Hymn for the Weekend,” 
which B is featured on. 
Overall, it was an entertaining show, but it’s up to the 
fans to decide who they thought the real star was.

UPCOMING HOME GAMES

MEN’S

WOMEN’S

LACROSSE

By MICHAEL TURAY

It was brutally cold on Friday afternoon, but that didn’t stop the University at 
Albany men’s lacrosse team from defeating Princeton University 11-6 in a preseason 
scrimmage at John Fallon Field.
UAlbany battled with last year’s Ivy League champion, a team that came one goal 
short of clinching a berth in the NCAA tournament a season ago. 
As expected, the frigid conditions led to a sloppy start for both teams. Each squad 
struggled to settle into a rhythm offensively, as demonstrated by several dropped 
routine passes. However, the Great Danes found their groove on both sides of the field 

as the game progressed.
UAlbany, who will search for a new identity this year without Miles or Lyle 
Thompson to set the tone, shook off rust early, netting the first six goals of the game, 
and not looking back afterward. 
Sophomore attack Connor Fields, who broke the UAlbany single-season record for 
goals scored by a freshman last season, showed his accomplishment was no fluke after 
scoring the team’s first two goals. Co-attack Seth Oakes also contributed two goals, 
including a beautiful no-look back-handed shot in the first quarter. The tandem figures 
provide much of the offense for Head Coach Scott Marr’s team this season.
Senior captain John Maloney, who was recently drafted 51st overall in the Major 
League Lacrosse Collegiate Draft, added a goal in the first as well, giving UAlbany a 
4-0 lead after one. 
In the second quarter, the UAlbany defense proved it is to be feared just as much 
as the offense. Senior Blaze Riorden, who is believed to be the best goalkeeper in the 
country by some of his teammates, showed off his skillset with a few tremendous saves, 
and his teammates fed off of the intensity of the preseason All-American selection.
Princeton’s offense looked rattled at times by the stout UAlbany defense. Throw 
in freezing temperatures on top of that, and the Tigers were clearly frustrated for the 
majority of the game. That frustration led to careless penalties, which UAlbany used to 
its advantage to capitalize on multiple man-down situations.
In the third quarter the rising frustration displayed itself as the referees were forced to 
separate players and issue penalties. Princeton proceeded to score two goals, but a pair 
of goals by junior attack Jake Cullen in the fourth helped squash any glimmer of hope 
the Tigers had.
For the second scrimmage in a row, reserve goalkeeper Trevor Cross entered in the 
fourth quarter to give some relief of Riorden, who seems to be on the field at all times 
this season. 
With two scrimmages under their belt, the Great Danes (No. 13 in Inside Lacrosse 
magazine’s preseason poll) hope their preseason wins will translate in to ones that 
actually count in the standings. UAlbany, picked to win the America East this season, 
travels to the Carrier Dome Feb. 21 in its season-opener to take on Syracuse, who are 
ranked No. 5.

Morning runs. Sounds like something 
one might enjoy along the beach, in warm 
weather, perhaps casually stopping to pet 
a cute dog when it walks by, right?
 Wrong. At least to a University at 
Albany football player.
 After winter break ends the entire 
football program has a meeting where 
a draft takes place to select teams for 
morning runs. The captains get to choose 
the teams, meaning they want to pick 
the players they think will do the best 
in the running and speed tests, but also 
they also want to consider who will 
excel in the classroom because all these 
components are taken into account when 
the final points are tallied.
 It’s a 5 a.m wake up. The athletes trek 
their hardly woken bodies from any of 
the quads on campus or, for some of the 
upperclassmen, from downtown to the 
turf to condition.
 They are out on the field by 5:55 
a.m. on the dot. You don’t want to be 
late. Not only does that jeopardize your 
running team, but it could also mean a 
nasty punishment from Head Coach Greg 
Gatusso.

 “If anyone is late for anything they’ll 
get a 6 a.m. on a day we’re not running in 
the morning and your team will lose 50 
points. And if you’re late for runs, don’t 
even bother showing up cause it’ll be 10 
times worse for you once you get there 
so you just have to accept defeat and take 
the next 6 a.m.,” captain Mike Nicastro 
said.
 Morning runs separate the guys who 
are distracted in the offseason from the 
ones willing to sacrifice their time, bodies 
and mental toughness for the sport. It’s 
hard to think of a better test than forcing 
a group of college guys to wake up two 
or three times a week a the crack of dawn 
to run their bodies into the ground in 
Albany winter weather.
 “It’s freezing out, but once you start 
running around it’s okay,” Nicastro 
said. He also added how the first week 
can be unsettling because it’s not very 
difficult, but then the week after is when 
the conditioning coaches start dispersing 
trash cans around the field because 
everyone is puking.
 “I would say last year the second 
week of morning runs more than half the 
team puked, it was pretty gross,” Nicastro 
said.

 Connor Hughes, the main coach of 
strength and conditioning for the football 
team, runs the morning sessions. His 
voice projects in the same manner on 
the turf as it does in the weight room. If 
Hughes is out there he is going to make it 
worth his while to help make these men 
better.
 Morning runs don’t only put pressure 
on these guys to challenge their bodies 
physically, but they also force them 
to focus on their studies because a big 
portion of the point system is doing well 
in school.
 Nicastro says you want your team to 
be the fastest and the smartest, because 
the winner usually gets some exclusive 
gear from Gatusso.
 “Last year Gatusso got the winning 
team Nike bucket hats with ‘UAlbany 
Football’ on it,” Nicastro said. 
 It’s hard to imagine getting your 
body moving at its fastest so early and in 
negative degree weather. The turf must 
sting to touch - forget feeling your fingers 
and toes. It’s a mental battle above all 
else out there.
 The UAlbany football team was 3-8 
overall last season, so perhaps for the 
team and coaches they believe it’s the 

offseason that will be their best bet in 
improving in the CAA conference.
 The runs are set up like this each 
morning:
 Different stations switch up on 
occasion, however the main ones for 
running are called ‘Four Quarters’ which 
consists of four periods of a different 
running exercise for five minutes straight.
 After that a running test called 
“Gassers” might happen which is 
essentially from one end line to the 
other, or a half  gasser or quarter gasser 
which is just a shorter back and fourth 
sprint. Apart from just running, there are 
different stations like 5-yard-10-yard-
5-yard sprints, sled pushes, figure eight 
cutting drills, box drills, cone drills, 
tennis ball competitions, relay races and 
so forth.
 There are lots of different 
competitions that help build a better 
overall athlete and also test different 
components of the team’s athleticism.
 The football team is going into week 
two of morning runs, so be forewarned if 
you’re thinking of playing some pick-
up on Bob Ford Field. There might be 
dozens of trash cans and uneasy football 
player’s leftovers.

For student-athletes, Sundays aren’t 
a day off. It’s typically a game day, a 
practice day, or a lifting or conditioning 
session, depending on the season 
and the sport. This past Sunday was 
Valentine’s Day, meaning student-
athletes everywhere had to find the love 
and basketball spark to their otherwise 
fleeting college relationship or fling.
 The 2000 hit movie “Love and 
Basketball” is the quintessential college 
athlete love story: Male basketball 
player meets a female one, and while 
one succeeds, the other one struggles, 
providing an imbalance that creates 
an emotional nightmare. But at the 
University at Albany—as well as many 
other places—it doesn’t work out quite 
like that. But it’s still fun to see what 
some of the UAlbany student-athletes 
had in mind for the special day.
 Unfortunately the UAlbany women’s 
basketball teams had their hearts broken 
on Sunday, giving the team its first loss 
in conference play all season. It was 
a big-time matchup at Maine, a game 
which featured the No. 1 and No. 2 teams 
in the America East. The game proved to 
be more important than picking the right 
restaurant—the Danes fell 65-53 in their 
first loss in the America East this year.
 After losing to them on the road 
earlier this year, the men’s basketball 
team Danes welcomed Maine to SEFCU 

Arena for a revenge date. The Great 
Danes manhandled the Black Bears, 
winning 108-64, the team’s largest 
margin-of-victory this season. It is 
reasonable to conclude the game put a 
damper on the night of some of Maine’s 
players who may have had romantic 
plans for later in the day.
 But for those student-athletes who 
didn’t have to worry about a game, 
love—or something like it--was in the 
air. Some said they were swamped with 
work and would share the love with 
their assignments. As for others, they 
said certain beverages would be their 
date on Valentine’s Day, while a few 
recognizable names planned elaborate 
dates for their partners to make the day 
extra special.
 Football players like to give off 
the image that they are tough and 
emotionless. But surprisingly, UAlbany 
has a few romantics on its team.
 Offensive lineman and waffle 
enthusiast Kevin Malloy—who is known 
as an Ed Sheeran lover--said he had a 
whole day planned for his girlfriend.
 “There’s this little dive of a breakfast 
place called ‘Dan’s Place’ I love. We’re 
going to go there for breakfast and just 
spending the day relaxing and doing 
some work, sadly,” Malloy said. “But for 
dinner I’m cooking her a three-course 
meal here and then gonna give her 
favorite chocolates.”
 When asked about what was on the 

dinner menu, Malloy asked 
for good luck wishes. Why?
 “The meal is marinated 
shrimp, baked potatoes 
and steak. And for dessert? 
Cake,” Malloy said.
 The Albany Student 
Press will have to follow up 
with Malloy’s girlfriend for 
a review of Chef Malloy’s 
work.
 Kyle Sakowski, a junior 
safety for the football team, 
may surprise readers with 
what he had in store for his 
girlfriend, who is a member 
of the dance team.
 “I’m picking up an 
Edible Arrangement and 
roses for her on Friday. 
Then I’m bringing her to 
the movies on Saturday 
because she cannot go out 
due to a basketball game 
on Sunday,” Sakowski said. 
“Then on Sunday I’m giving 
her roses again after she 
performs at the basketball 
game and bringing her to the 
place I took her for our first date.”
 Sakowski and his valentine went to 
D’Raymonds—a Loudonville-based 
Italian restaurant--on their first date, so 
Sakowski said he would take her there 
after she danced at the basketball game.
 “It’s all a surprise--she doesn’t 

know,” said Sakowski, who was 
interviewed prior to the Sunday date.
 It’s no doubt the young woman 
will be pleasantly surprised about the 
date, especially when she realizes the 
whole school will know how much of a 
romantic “bad-boy” Sakowski can really 
be.

Following a tough loss 
Thursday night against New 
Hampshire, the University 
at Albany Great Danes 
(21-7, 10-3 America East) 
bounced back and defeated 
the Maine Black Bears 
(8-18, 4-9 America East) 
108-64 on Sunday.
The Great Danes 
dominated right from the 
start and the Black Bears 
never contested. Despite the 
Black Bears’ struggles this 
season, the Great Danes are 
coming off a loss the last 
time these two teams met 
up back on Jan. 15, when 
the Danes lost 81-79 up in 
Maine.
Ray Sanders led the way 
for the Danes with 22 points 
and three steals. 
“Our defense was solid 
tonight for the most part,” 
Sanders said after the game.  
“We wanted to bounce back 
after UNH and wanted to 
show what we were capable 
of defensively as a whole 
unit.”
Sanders made a great 
defensive play at the 10:52 
mark, making a steal in the 
backcourt which led to an 
easy layup.
After ending the first half 
on a 15-2 run in the final 
4:16, the Danes came out in 
the second half and scored 
the first 12 points.
At 13:30 Sanders made 
a nice pass in transition to 
Peter Hooley who threw 
it down for a big dunk. 
Seconds later, Sanders 
forced another steal and 
made the wide open dunk, 
sending cheers throughout 
SEFCU Arena. 
Hooley finished 5-9 from 
the field with 12 points 
before sitting out most of 
the second half.
Coach Will Brown 
was proud of his team’s 

performance. 
“We did a good job 
following the scouting 
report,” Brown said. “Our 
defense made stops which 
got us out in transition and 
got us easy opportunities.”
With the lopsided score, 
10 Great Danes got to check 
into the game and all 10 of 
those players scored. Dallas 
Ennema had a season high 
16 points in 20 minutes of 
action.
“It’s fun to see guys 
come off the bench and 
contribute,” Sanders said. 
“We just wanted to execute 
the gameplan and have a lot 
of fun.”
There was a scary 
moment when freshman 
guard Joe Cremo hit the 
floor hard going up for a 
layup at 13:06. He laid on 
court briefly before coming 
out of the game. The injury 
was not as serious as it 
looked and Cremo checked 
back into the game at 
the 7:06 mark with a big 
ovation from the UAlbany 
faithful. 
The 108 points is the 
first time the Danes reached 
triple digits this season and 
they tied UMass Lowell 
for most points in a game 
this season when they did it 
against Maine on February 
11th. 
The Danes continue to 
dominate at SEFCU Arena 
and are a perfect 12-0.
Now the Danes will be 
focused for their big game 
7 pm Wednesday night 
at SEFCU arena where 
they will face the Stony 
Brook Seawolves (21-4, 
12-0 America East). The 
Seawolves are currently in 
first place in the America 
East and have the longest 
winning streak in Division 
I college basketball with 18 
games.
