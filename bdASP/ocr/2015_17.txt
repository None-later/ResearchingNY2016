WHO ELSE LIVES IN 
THE STUDENT GHETTO?

t’s just past 2 a.m., but all is not quiet 
at the home where Laurie, a resident of 
Pine Hills, has lived since 1993. Rowdy 
students are making their way between bars 
and house parties, walking down North Lake 
Avenue right past her home.
   It’s common to hear students screaming 
late at night or urinating in the alleyways 
between houses, according to Laurie. Even 
the destruction of property and vehicles is 
not unheard of. 

By KEVIN FUREY

Laurie, who is originally from 
the New York City area, attended 
the University at Albany from 
1985 until 1990. She never moved 
back downstate. 
“I liked the city,” Laurie said.
Once considered a retreat for 
Albany’s elite and wealthy, Pine 
Hills has had many faces over the 
years. Although many permanent 
residents would agree that year-
to-year the neighborhood doesn’t 
change much, within the last 40 
years students have shifted the 
demographics of Pine Hills. Some 
of the permanent residents recall a 
Pine Hills that was not referred to 
as the “student ghetto.”
Even though the student 
population in Pine Hills is high, 
many non-students live there as 
well. Roughly 31 percent of those 
who live in Pine Hills are between 

the ages of 20 and 24, which is 
the largest age demographic in 
the neighborhood, according to 
AreaVibes, a website that gives 
locations “liveability scores.” 
Many older, long-term residents 
live in the neighborhood as well.
Today, Pine Hills is lined 
with deteriorating historic row 
homes, many dating back to the 
late 19th century. The streets are 
anything but quiet. The vibrations 
of EDM music can often be 
heard thumping out of basements 
where illegal underground parties 
frequently take place. Broken 
beer bottles litter the sidewalks 
and dirty sneakers hang from the 
telephone wires. 
Many home owners have seen 
their Pine Hills homes depreciate 
in value, so they can’t afford to 
leave and end up feeling trapped. 

Carolyn Keefe, 
president of the Pine 
Hills Improvement 
Group, noted that 
as more permanent 
residents age and 
die, their homes are 
often sold to people 
interested in renting 
to students, which 
reduces the number of 
permanent residents. 
Despite the loud 
noises, Laurie isn’t the 
only one who likes the 
neighborhood. 
Virginia Hammer, 
president of the Pine 
Hills Neighborhood 
Association, said 
she feels that many 
permanent residents 
enjoy the diversity of 
the neighborhood and 
have learned to put up 
with some periodic 
annoyances. 
However, those periodic 
annoyances have caused tension 
between permanent residents and 
the transient student population.
Hammer said that many 
permanent residents stereotype all 
students, often viewing them in a 
negative light. She feels that after 
the “Kegs N’ Eggs” Riot in 2011, 
the media painted a negative 
image of UAlbany students, even 
though a small number of students 
were actually involved in the 
event.

Keefe added that the common 
perception of students is that 
they are too immature to handle 
the responsibilities of living 
on their own and that they are 
inexperienced in urban living.
“Many residents express 
that they feel like they live in 
the middle of an unsupervised 
playground,” Keefe said.
Perhaps the biggest nuisance 
for many permanent residents 
is the noise level, especially 
late at night. Keefe said that 
there seems to be a correlation 

between the consumption of 
alcohol and the level of noise. 
She also added that when the 
drinking age was raised in 
the 1980s the noise problem 
worsened, as many students 
were pushed out of bars and 
into house parties closer to the 
homes of permanent residents.
Many residents feel a 
sense of dread as late August 
approaches, and a sense of 
relief in late May, according to

FASHION

By RUSSELL J. OLIVER

Students at the University at Albany 
who want to get opportunities in the 
fashion world, look no further. The 
Fashion Association of Collegiate 
Entrepreneurs, or FACE for short, is an 
organization that allows students to work 
together creatively and share their ideas 
about fashion. FACE also allows students 
to get in contact with professionals in the 
field that can lead to potential connections 
in the fashion world.
“FACE serves as an outlet for both 
professional development for students 
interested in pursuing a career within 
the fashion industry as well as… for 
creativity unlike any other at our 
university,” said Sofia De Luise, a 
student at UAlbany who is the president 
of FACE.
De Luise is a senior who studies in 
marketing and information technology 
management. She also said that FACE 
tries to offer different programming 
than other groups at the university by 
incorporating fashion, art, pop culture 
and social issues into what they do.
Co-Presidents Ashley Grant and 
Harvey Wong formed the organization in 
the spring of 2013. The past three years 
have seen FACE grow as an organization 
by continuously providing the campus 
with unique fashion events on a regular 
basis.

FACE holds weekly programs that 
focus on a variety of topics, such as 
careers in fashion and fashion in pop 
culture. They will be hosting their third 
annual Spring Fashion Week later this 
semester. 
During their annual fashion week, 
FACE has educational events. They table 
all week with recognition of student 
fashion on campus, as well as host 
giveaways for students.
Another event run by FACE is the 
Human Art Gallery, which has student 
models pose as mannequins throughout 
the campus wearing clothes from student 
designers.
“As a fashion organization we have so 
much opportunity to do a lot of cool stuff 
and again, it’s not all about clothes,” De 
Luise said.
FACE’s members have a variety of 
majors, as the group doesn’t have a major 
requirement for joining the organization.
By giving students an experience with 
fashion and getting them connections 
to professionals within the field, FACE 
gives students the chance to learn about 
the fashion world.
“By arming students with this 
knowledge and helping them connect with 
professionals, we hope to help as many 
students as possible to transition into a 
career in fashion if they wish to do so,” 
De Luise said.  “Even if someone wasn’t 
interested in moving into fashion as a 

career, there’s still so much that 
can be learned by our program 
offerings and events.”
FACE is currently looking 
for partnerships with other 
student organizations for this 
semester. They have monthly 
meetings where they discuss 
new ideas and are always open 
to new members joining the 
organization.

THEASP.EIC@GMAIL.COM

By MILO VOTAVA

If you have ever lived on one of 
the four main quads on campus, you 
have probably seen one of the stickers 
for a brand called “Chuga-Chaga.” 
Generally found above the card readers 
on the doors leading into the building, 
the sticker itself is almost a mystery, 
only displaying the company’s slogan, 
“Restore Repair Revitalize.” What you 
would not know just from seeing the 
sticker is that it stands for an independent 
student-run tea company based right here 
in Albany. 
The idea for the company was started 
by its now-CEO Luke Evans. While 
working under Juan Gomez in 2010, a 
chef in the Catskills who was interested 
in new superfoods, Luke was introduced 
to chaga, a type of mushroom that grew 
on birch trees in cold weather, just like 
the ones that grew in his backyard. 
Chaga is highly antioxidant-rich and 
contains more complex carbohydrates 
like polysaccharides that help stabilize 
blood sugars as well as melanin, an 
important component of your hair and 
nails. 
After going on a hike with Gomez 
and harvesting around ten pounds of 
chaga, Luke did some research and 
realized that for such a highly acclaimed 
superfood, chaga itself was not very 
well known.  He decided that it would 
be a good business venture to introduce 
more people to such a beneficial food. 
Luke ended up collaborating with his 
roommate and friends Mark Iskandar and 
Adam Kaiser, both also University at 
Albany students, and went on to turn his 
high school dream into a college reality. 
Marc Iskandar was Evans’ roommate, 
dorming with him on Colonial Quad; he 
remembers hiking for chaga with Evans. 
He says that while the initial hikes did 
not end up with them harvesting a lot 
of chaga, they all became better at it as 
time went on. Now, after many years of 
harvesting chaga, creating and promoting 
their company, they are finally ready 
to launch their final product in March. 
Their kick-starter is planning to end on 
the Feb. 26 and it is currently 86 percent 

funded. 
This business has changed all that 
have been involved with it for the better 
as well. Iskandar, the company’s head 
of Sales and Marketing, started here at 
UAlbany as a political science major. 
Now, after Chuga-Chaga participated 
in the highly competitive Food-X in 
Brooklyn, an international business 
acceleration program that focuses on 
long-term food ventures, the company 
has moved back to Albany. Iskandar has 
realized the impact of their business. 
“I felt that political science and law 
was going to be the way to impact the 
world. I met Luke and then realized that 
the real way I could do that was through 
business,” said Iskandar. 
Chuga-Chaga really is trying to impact 
the world. They have a program called 
One Tea One Tree Promise that states 
that they will plant a tree for every bottle 
of their Tree Tea that is sold. They are 
also teaming up with The Eden Project, 
a program that focuses on improving 
both widespread deforestation and 
poverty by employing impoverished 
people to plant trees. Chuga-Chaga is an 
environmentally conscious business and 
it’s important to note how much all the 
members believe in their business. 
While the Tree Tea won’t be available 
in stores for a while, you can preorder 
some off their kick-starter, and you can 
get it in places like Whole Foods Market, 
Fresh Market, and Price Chopper’s 
Market 32 once mass distribution starts. 
From stickers on door handles to making 
an impact on the world, it’s good to see 
how far these three UAlbany students 
have come.

A story in the ASP from Oct. 8, 1968, a tumultuous time.

Keefe. The neighborhood is less vibrant when the 
students leave, some businesses close temporarily, 
and more on-street parking is available. Of course the 
neighborhood is much quieter, as well.
“In the summer, it’s often so quiet, we can hear birds 
and crickets,” Keefe said. 
While some landlords take their responsibilities 
seriously, there’s no question that other landlords 
simply use their properties to make money, often taking 
advantage of their tenants, Keefe said.
To help handle problems within the community 
and to assist students who are living or plan on living 
off-campus, UAlbany established Neighborhood Life 
in August of 2014. Neighborhood Life does everything 
from talking with students who have been ticketed 
or arrested off-campus to assisting students with any 
problems that they have with their landlords. Prior to 
the establishment of Neighborhood Life, all off-campus 
issues were handled by the Office of Personal Safety.
According to Keefe, students began living in Pine 
Hills in the 1970s and 1980s, when UAlbany underwent 

expansion. Although she has only lived in the area 
since 1994, she has several neighbors who have lived 
in the neighborhood since before it was predominately 
populated by students. 
Keefe, who lives near The College of Saint Rose, said 
that she chose to stay in Pine Hills and raise her family 
there because she loves her home and the convenience 
of its location, near many shops and businesses. She also 
added that she feels safe in Pine Hills.
Hammer said that although many permanent residents 
have built negative stereotypes of students, when they 
have the opportunity to interact with students in a 
positive way, such as during neighborhood clean-ups, 
their perception of students changes for the better.
Neighborhood Life manages year-round neighborhood 
watches, which consist partly of students and partly 
of permanent residents. They report noise complaints, 
destruction of property, building code issues, as well as 
any other problems in the neighborhood. One time they 
even assisted a disoriented elderly man who was walking 
around in his boxers in the middle of the winter, possibly 
saving his life. 
While doing neighborhood watch patrols, students 
and residents have an opportunity to interact with one 
another, since they go out in groups. Any student of 
UAlbany or resident of Pine Hills who is interested in 

volunteering for neighborhood watches can. The only 
requirements are an application and a background check. 
Then there is basic training through the Neighborhood 
Engagement Program of the Albany Police Department.
Keefe said that she appreciates the efforts that 
UAlbany and the Albany Police put into managing 
issues between permanent residents and students. She 
also added that without those efforts she didn’t think her 
family would still be living in their home.
What Pine Hills residents such as Laurie, Hammer 
and Keefe want to stress to students, is that the 
neighborhood is not only comprised of students. Within 
Pine Hills there are families, senior citizens, people with 
special needs and people who have to wake up early in 
the morning.
Keefe had one final message to the students who 
reside in Pine Hills:
“This is your neighborhood too, so live here like you 
would in your family’s neighborhood, and live here like 
you plan to stay, maybe you will.”

ustice Antonin Scalia, top-
conservative voice on the Supreme 
Court of the United States, died 
recently leaving the burning 
question of who will succeed his seat 
and when.  
Scalia’s death leaves the Supreme 
Court evenly split between liberal and 
conservative justices. His death marks 
the end of an era in which conservatives 
held the majority of seats on the bench, 
and begins a period of uncertainty 
during which a new justice will be 
nominated. 
Amid the controversy aroused after 
Scalia’s death, the main conversation 
focuses on President Barack Obama’s 
nomination of a new Supreme Court 
justice. The majority of conservative 
thinkers feel that the opportunity to 
appoint a new justice should be reserved 
for the next president. Others assert that 
as president, Obama has both a right 
and a duty to nominate a candidate for 
the open seat. 
Regardless of how some interpret 
the Constitution, Obama has made his 
intentions clear and said, “I plan to 
fulfill my constitutional responsibility to 
nominate a successor in due time.”
I stand by Obama in that he should 
act according to the duties stated in the 
Constitution and select and appoint a 
new justice. The conservative push for 

the next president to replace Scalia’s 
seat is arbitrary and predicated on the 
hope for a conservative president and 
thus holds no ground in dictating the 
remainder of Obama’s term.
Obama’s plan to select a nominee 
is a proactive step for liberals as 
opportunities to overturn a majority 
in the court rarely come around. 
The Senate, currently controlled by 
Republicans, is required to approve 
presidential nominees for the Supreme 
Court. Since Scalia’s death, numerous 
Republicans have made it clear that they 
plan to obstruct any efforts to confirm a 
replacement and insist that this selection 
should be left to the victor of the 2016 
presidential election.
In these circumstances, gridlock 
seems unavoidable and the United 
States may see an eight-member 
Supreme Court for the remainder of 
Obama’s term. The prospect of an 
eight-member court leaves citizens on 
the edge of their seats as many await 
important decisions currently pending. 
What happens to these decisions in the 
case of a 4-4 tie? 
The Supreme Court has two options 
in such situations: they can vote to 
hear the case a second time when a 
new colleague joins them or they can 
hand down a one-sentence opinion 
that upholds the result reached in the 

lower court, according to a report by the 
Associated Press. 
If things go according to Republican 
plans, gridlock in the Senate will stall 
the process of filling Scalia’s seat, 
forcing the tied-court into upholding 
lower court decisions in many of their 
pending cases. In cases like Friedrichs 
v. California Teachers Association, the 
future for millions of unionized workers 
is at stake. 
The Guardian considered this case 
“virtually certain” to present a 5-4 
decision in favor of the conservative 
majority prior to Scalia’s death. With 
Scalia’s swing-vote eliminated, the 
deadlock within the Court may prevail, 
leaving the outcome of Friedrichs and 
many other cases uncertain. 
In the short time since Scalia’s 
death, top political and legal pundits 
have dissected all of these questions. 
It is uncertain what will happen in 
the last 11 months of Obama’s final 
term. While the United States awaits 
Obama’s nominee, the conservative vs. 
liberal debate roars on. As this year’s 
election is near, the importance of 
picking the best presidential candidate 
grows exponentially. A pivotal point 
in history, the upcoming decisions will 
dictate our nation’s ideological tone for 
the next several decades. 

Who should fill in 
Scalia’s position?

Upcoming presidential candidates for 2016 feel they should fill Scalia’s position on the Supreme Court instead of

here are many people 
who believe social 
media is just an 
outlet for personal 
feelings and sharing 
moments, but they could 
not be more wrong. Social 
media is infused into our 
everyday lives so much 
so now that opportunities 
come from it. 
Although social 
media is used mostly for 
documentation of our 
everyday lives, it is also 
a way of connecting with 
billions of people all around 
the world.
Having an active account 
on Twitter with engaged 
followers can increase the 
amount of opportunities 
a person can have. Since 
having a high follower 
count is like networking, 
the more followers users 
have the greater chance 
they have of important 
people seeing their tweets.  
One of our very own 
students here at the 
University at Albany, 
Zainub Amir, received an 
opportunity of a lifetime 
from music star, Taylor 
Swift - she was given the 
job of social media “fan 
ambassador.” According 
to Amir in an interview 
from shesaboss.org, this 
all started when she began 
tweeting about the singer 
and caught the attention of 
Swift’s team. 
“In 2012, her team asked 
me to come to New York 
for release week, that’s 
when it all started,” Amir 
said. “I spent a week with 
Taylor and now every time 
she releases an album, 
I provide social media 
updates.”
With celebrities using 
Twitter more to interact 
with their fans, it’s 
important to remember that 

anyone could see what you 
send (unless you’re private) 
when hitting the send 
button on a tweet.
A young woman named 
Raven B. Varona, also 
known as Ravie B, landed 
an opportunity taking 
photographs of Future, one 
of hip-hop’s biggest stars. 
What started off as just 
messing around on Twitter 
ended up providing Varona 
with the chance to start the 
career in photography she 
always wanted. 
In an interview from 
The Fader, Varona said she 
had just quit her job when 
she met Future. Something 
inside her told her to pursue 
her photography, but she 
never thought that Twitter 
would be the way her career 
would catapult. 
“Social media played a 
big role in connecting me 
to Future 100 percent,” 
said Varona. “It was cool 
because all these kids that 
follow me for photos of 
Future remember when it 
was just a Twitter thing.”
Varona’s opportunity 
with Future opened the 
doors for her in shooting 
other big celebrities such as 
Fabolous, Drake, Big Sean, 
Stephen Curry and LeBron 
James. Anyone can say 
that Varona might not have 
needed social media to be 
successful, but it’s possible 
her career wouldn’t have 
taken off as fast as it did if 
it hadn’t been for Twitter.
Social media is 
singlehandedly reshaping 
the world. Having an 
active account and active 
followers could only prove 
to be beneficial to you. 
It is coming to the point 
where social media is not 
just a social forum for just 
thoughts anymore- it can be 
used to further ambitions 
and a career.

How social

eing a college student 
is a life-changing 
experience. Students 
who go away for college get to 
experience making adult decisions 
for what may be the first time in 
their lives. But those decisions 
all come with a lot of financial 
weight. 
   For a quick breakdown, here 
at the University at Albany, 
we currently spend $6,470 per 
academic year for tuition alone. 
Add another $2,024 in all the fees 
that students pay plus $11,636 
in housing and up to $2,545 on 
a meal plan for those who live 
on campus. Add that all up and 
it comes to a cost that can be as 
high as $22,675, according to the 
university’s website.
   These numbers can be daunting 
and intimidating, especially for 

students. 
   We have to be able to cut down 
those costs. Financial aid loans 
are a first step in solving the issue.
   The next best solution, however, 
is to get a job. It just makes sense. 
It is a good way to make some 
extra money while in college. 
Typically weekends and nights 
are free for students to work part-
time on or around campus.
   The biggest question revolves 
around the capability of getting 
hired, especially as a current 
student.
   Well, according to the 
Department of Labor, the 
unemployment rate in the Albany-
Schenectady-Troy region has 
dropped from 4.6 percent to 4 
percent from December 2014 to 
December 2015. The likelihood 
of obtaining a job in the area is 
steadily increasing.

   I can’t say that obtaining a job 
is hard. Small retail stores in the 
mall always seem eager to hire 
students in the area. It keeps 
getting implanted in our heads 
that we should be wary of getting 
hired, that it will never happen. 
But, current employers are no 
longer thinking that.
   “Often a great business 
decision, choosing to hire a 
student or a recent college 
graduate gives all businesses 
much more job description 
flexibility,” an online article by 
the Undercover Recruiter says. 
“Probably the biggest advantage 
that hiring a student gives a 
business is the lower cost of the 
employees’ yearly salary.”
   The article also says that 
employers are more inclined 
to hire college students or 
recent graduates because of 

how comfortable they are with 
technology and because they 
are easier to manage, not feeling 
entitled as seasoned workers may 
feel.
   I feel more comfortable 
knowing that my age group has an 
actual shot at getting jobs after or 
during college.
   Now I know that there is a 
market for college students. It is 
a bit discouraging to know that 
I may get taken advantage of, 
but statistically, my chances at 
employment are improving.
   The balance between school 
and a part-time job is like hell, 
but the way I see it, the time to 
struggle is now. The window of 
opportunities for college students 
is slowly being cracked open and 
retail companies are jumping at 
the idea that college students will 
be beneficial to hire.    

   For students here at UAlbany, 
there are a few different shopping 
outlets ready and willing to hire 
several students for seasonal and 
part-time employment.
   I don’t think college students 
should commit to a job that 
devalues their worth and/or does 
not allow for the most benefits. 
However, if having the extra 
pocket change is needed, then do 
what it takes for now.
   The time to build a resume 
through silly retail or on-campus 
jobs, and full-time studies, is right 
now. As students, we will be dealt 
many blows, but they will all lead 
to the dream job that we have 
been striving for since stepping 
onto this campus. I would go 
through hell now reaching for 
my goals, rather than attempt the 
easy, and often useless, way out.

   Up until a few months ago, the 
Zika virus has been “spreading 
explosively” according to the 
World Health Organization. The 
hysteria is spreading rapidly 
through news outlets and health 
officials. The CDC went so far as 
to activate Emergency Operations 
on Jan. 22, as well as issue travel 
alerts, especially for those who 
are pregnant or are considering 
becoming pregnant.
   The declaration of a 
Public Health Emergency of 
International Concern by the 
World Health Organization 
(WHO) is an attempt to bring 

awareness to a virus that has been 
around since 50 years ago. 
   Carried by the daytime Aedes 
mosquito, the disease was only 
common in equatorial territories 
of Africa and Asia for decades. 
   The virus already had an 
outbreak in the French Polynesia. 
The virus will eventually spread 
across the Pacific at this rate. 
Most cases of the Zika virus exist 
in Brazil at the moment, where 
200 million people are at risk.
   It’s difficult for many health 
organizations to conceal their 
concern that the virus will spread 
like wildfire, once it officially 

reaches the United States. Cases 
are already being reported in 
the east and west coast as well 
as southern states. The CDC 
has already given notices to 
physicians and medical personnel 
on how to treat someone who 
has recently traveled to a country 
where the virus is active. A total 
of 23 countries and territories 
have claimed to have the virus.
   How does  one know if he or 
she has contracted it? 
   According to the CDC, 80 
percent of people with the virus 
are unaware they have it. In most 
cases it does not affect adults. 
The most common symptoms for 
adults are fevers, rashes, and joint 
pains. The virus mainly affects 
unborn children, putting them at 
risk of microcephaly. 
   Microcephaly is a condition 
where children are born with an 
abnormally small head as a result 
of incomplete brain development. 

This is a common issue in Brazil, 
which the WHO has directly 
attributed to the Zika virus. 
   However, many health 
organizations have called out the 
melodrama, saying that the risk of 
the Zika virus reaching the United 
States is unlikely. 
   According to The New York 
Times, “Health authorities have 
said a major outbreak in the U.S. 
is unlikely because many states 
have effective programs to control 
mosquitos.” The chances are low, 
especially with the country’s 
history of virus epidemics in the 
past. 
   The parallels between the Zika 
virus and Ebola are uncanny. 
Ebola, like the Zika virus, is a 
foreign disease that is more than 
half a century old, and yet the 
disease came to prominence when 
the chances of it spreading in the 
United States became a possibility 
a few years back.

   A very real threat in Africa, 
Ebola never evolved beyond the 
epidemic of fear infecting the 
United States. Many precautions 
were taken and there were daily 
news updates to prepare for the 
disease, but it ultimately infected 
four people in the United States. 
   With the most effective threat 
about the virus being that there is 
no proper vaccination as of yet, 
it is not difficult to see why the 
concerns are strong. Nevertheless, 
it is important to note that the 
virus has not yet been associated 
with any fatalities, but instead has 
been associated with the rising 
rate of infant microcephaly. Many 
South American countries are 
alerting women to put any plans 
of pregnancy on hold or to visit a 
care physician daily until WHO 
and other health groups can gain 
a better understanding of the 
fundamental nature of the virus.

D

uring this time of year, vaccinations and 
proper attire to accommodate the shifting 
tone in weather are all too familiar. With 
flu season currently in full swing, Centers of 
Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) are 
proposing certain precautions.

ZIKA VIRUS SPREADS HYSTERIA

Disney does represent 
minorities. It is not to our liking, 
but Disney went out and has 
captured other cultures aside 
from white culture.
Disney is very influential in 
the United States, and one of 
the things kids look up to the 
most are the Disney princesses. 
Children mainly look up to the 
white princesses, since those of 
other races and backgrounds are 
outnumbered four to eight. 
However, we have to 
acknowledge that the Disney 
franchise started back in the 
1920s, and the list of princesses 
began in 1937 with Snow White.
We didn’t see our first ethnic 
princess, Jasmine, until the ‘90s. 
However, Jasmine didn’t come 
into the princess scene until 
four other Caucasian princesses 
were added alongside Snow 
White. So we have to give 
Disney leeway. It just went 
along with the era at the time 
and decided to showcase other 
cultures. Entertainment didn’t 
revolve around diversity at the 
time, but instead focused on the 
mainstream.
And as the United States 
shifted, so did entertainment, 
which meant Disney started to 
create more ethnic princesses. 
It added Jasmine, Pocahontas, 
Mulan and Tiana, who were 
Arabian, Native-American, 
Chinese and African-American, 
respectively. It comes off as 
if Disney had met their quota 
for minorities. It was time to 
go back to their old ways, with 
princesses like Rapunzel and 
Merida. Nevertheless, people 
can’t appreciate what has been 
introduced for them. 
As of now, minorities aren’t 
being overly represented in 
Disney. However, a minority 
presence is visible and continues 
to grow. 
In fact, another Disney movie 
set to release in fall of 2016 is 
called “Moana.” Set in the South 
Pacific, the animated film is 

expected to revolve around a 
female character, possibly a new 
addition to the line of princesses.
We can’t limit Disney to 
just their princesses either. We 
have to take account for it’s 
other films, as well as their 
presence on television. We have 
to appreciate Princess Tiana’s 
pursuit of her dream restaurant 
with a New Orleans twist in 
the “Princess and the Frog.” 
We have to appreciate the dogs 
running around in Mexico of 
“Beverly Hills Chihuahua.”
And we can’t forget the 
Japanese-American Boy Scout, 
Russell, who follows an old 
man’s journey in “Up.” 
Even on television, Disney 
had shows such as “That’s so 
Raven”, which followed the 
life of the black Baxter family. 
“Wizards of Waverly Place” 
starred a half-Mexican family. 
And for all those who don’t 
know, Disney is international: 
Each international division has 
modified it to their culture. There 
are many versions of Disney that 
imitate plots of television shows. 
For instance, Disney Channel 
India has remade “The Suite Life 
of Zack and Cody” into “The 
Suite Life of Karan and Kabir.” 
This is globalization at its finest.
The main concern is that 
people not only want more 
ethnic Disney princesses or more 
representation of minorities, 
they also want a variety of 
people to relate to. For white 
people, multiple characters can 
be idolized, yet minorities are 
limited to only a few options.
It’s cool that Chinese kids 
who watch Disney have Mulan 
to look up to, yet that’s the only 
character they can relate to on 
a cultural level. It’s nice how 
black kids can connect with 
Tiana, yet that is still one person 
compared to the many characters 
white kids have. 
Disney is doing a good job 
trying to represent minorities, 
but it can do a better job. In time 
the representation should, and 
will, improve.

Allow me to introduce 
myself. My name is Jeffrey 
Rosenheck. I am a senior here 
at the University at Albany, 
preparing to graduate in May. 
Though I am not the most 
outspoken person on campus, 
I enjoy being active in various 
clubs and activities, as well 
as keeping up to date with the 
current events in the Albany 
Community.
Like most young adults at 
this school who are searching 
for their place in this world, my 
four years of college has seen 
both its ups and downs. I have 
received As in some classes, 
and come close to failing others. 
I have made lifelong friends, 
and met people who consider 
me an enemy. There are days 
where I feel like everything is 
going my way, and others where 
I feel like the world’s mission is 
to kick me while I am down.
Despite all of the positive 
and negative emotions endured 
during my tenure here at 
UAlbany, I never felt like my 
safety was threatened. Put in its 
simplest way: I felt protected. 
This opinion, though, has 
changed in the past weeks. 
On Jan. 31, 2016, you wrote 
an email to the student body, 
stating that three women the 
previous night were harassed 
and assaulted by 10 to 12 males 
and females on the 11 CDTA 
bus. You continued the email, 
stating that you would return 
back to the UAlbany campus, 
and work with the Albany 
Police Department to catch the 
persons responsible for this 
incident. Though all the facts of 
the case were not in front of you 
at the time this email was both 
written and sent, you took the 
women’s word that this event 
happened. 

Shortly after the email was 
sent, public outcry came from 
a local and national standpoint. 
There were protests on campus 
and social media. The women 
who were allegedly assaulted 
called for the 10 to 12 males 
and females to be indicted, as 
well as the bus driver on the 11. 
To avoid rambling on, I will 
once again put these events in 
its simplest terms: things got 
out of control.
Upon finding out that these 
three students could possibly 
be lying about the alleged 
assault, or  maybe even be 
the ones who started the 
fight (gasp!), you went to the 
UAlbany community once 
again, this time asking us to 
reserve judgment, be patient, 
and respectful of the ongoing 
investigation. 
But, how are we to follow 
this precedent when you, 
President Jones, did not reserve 
judgment,  have patience, or 
show respect?
How are we, as students, 
supposed to feel safe in this 
school, when our own president 
lines us up for execution before 
giving us a fair trial?
How are we supposed to turn 
a blind eye, when a student 
in YOUR care left YOUR 
university mid-semester, 
because he felt his life was 
threatened?
To me, this is not a racial 
problem. This is not a gender 
problem. This is not a black 
versus white, or male versus 
female, or student versus 
student problem. This is about 
what is right. This is about due 
process.
Regardless of what the 
outcome may be in the 
forthcoming weeks, no matter 
who is proven guilty or 

innocent, you did not provide 
the UAlbany community with 
due process. You heard a 
story, immediately took it to be 
true, and sent out an email to 
the student and faculty body, 
indicting 10 to 12 students 
for their crimes. You did not 
remain impartial, you did not 
provide adequate notice to the 
alleged perpetrators, and you 
did not give an opportunity to 
hear the 10 to 12 students’ side 
of the story (a direct violation of 
the Student’s Bill of Rights). 
This is not fair to the 10 to 12 
students being put on trial for a 
crime they might not have even 
committed. This is not fair to 
the student who left because he 
felt threatened. This is not fair 
to the student body. 
I believe that you should 
send a personal apology to 
the UAlbany family. We 
cannot, and will not, be the 
victims of something that has 
plagued our nation. We must 
reserve judgment until all of 
the evidence is brought before 
us. You must lead the way. 
You must prove to us that due 
process does not have a skin 
color. 
I appreciate the time you 
took in reading this letter, as 
well as the time you are taking 
to further this investigation. 
Unfortunately, due to my 
class schedule, I will not be 
able to attend your Critical 
Conversation on Feb. 23. I hope 
that all students, whoever they 
may be, that are guilty of this 
heinous crime, be brought to 
justice. 
            Forever a Great Dane,
                  Jeffrey Rosenheck

The presence of two Hollywood actors, a selection of 
musical acts ranging from experimental jazz to grunge 
punk, and a wide array of framed, tasteful nude photos 
spread throughout the house. Oh, and free popcorn. That’s 
what went down in a rather unassuming house on Morris 
Street in Downtown Albany last Thursday, Feb. 18. That 
house is called The World Citizen Party House, and for 
them, an evening like that isn’t out of the ordinary. 
Currently one of the many DIY house venues in the 
Capital Region, the WCPH typically hosts a bill of local 
and underground touring musicians at least once a month. 
However, unlike the standard basement setup of other 
DIY venues such as the beloved Treehouse, the WCPH 
melds many types of art and creative expression together 
in a layout that consists of both living room and basement 
performance areas. As one artist plays in the shockingly 
clean basement, surrounded by walls covered in regional 
art, “permanently borrowed” street signs, and local 
politicians’ campaign signs—one of which is altered to 
read “Erect Gay Boner”—the other artist sets up in the 
living room upstairs. Considering the low ceiling and small 
circumference, the acoustics of the room actually sound 
halfway decent and the positioning of the stage in the far 
left corner allows for ample viewing space.
On the other hand, the living room is much narrower 
and the presence of a large piano and a series of recording 
equipment takes up a good portion of the room, forcing 
attendees to squeeze together and kneel down in front in 
order to get a good view. However, given the exceptionally 
inviting atmosphere of the WCPH, there’s absolutely no 
reason to complain about getting closer with your friendly 
neighbor and striking up a conversation about the always-
eclectic lineup of musicians. 
On Thursday, the WCPH was proud to present Sons of 
an Illustrious Father, the somewhat bluesy and at times 
noisy indie rock band of actor Ezra Miller who’s known for 
his roles in “The Perks of Being a Wallflower” and “We 
Need to Talk About Kevin.” Astonishingly enough, actress 
Shailene Woodley of films such as “Divergent” and “The 
Fault In Our Stars” also made an appearance. However, 
both stars kept a low profile and could’ve been mistaken for 
any other member of the crowd. Rather than ducking away 

to support an ego, both of them respectfully listened to the 
other performers, all of which were particularly talented.
Rad Scientists, a funky, impeccably tight jazz sextet 
kicked off the night with an energized, and at times jaw-
dropping collection of original tunes. They consisted of two 
saxophonists, a guitarist, bassist, drummer, and an apparent 
frontman/keyboardist who introduced each song, one of 
which he said was inspired by a period of binging on NASA 
videos. Nerdy, classically trained and an unconventional 
experience for most of the punks in attendance, Rad 
Scientists were thoroughly intriguing and some of the 
keyboard, drum, and guitar solos were truly incredible 
displays of musicianship. 
Despite them being a tough act to beat, singer-songwriter 
Another Michael, accompanied for the first time live 

by three other musicians, followed with a familiar, yet 
distinguishing group of sunny day R&B pop. Their warm 
melodies were carried by a tender, unobtrusive backbone 
of piano twinkling, acoustic strumming, and occasional 
percussive thud. Most of the songs were short, easy to 
listen to and sort of just ended without developing into 
anything grandiose or pretentious. Another Michael’s 
simple, charming approach to an often tiresome genre was 
delightful, once again earning a thumbs up from members 
of the crowd who wouldn’t usually consider them to be a 
part of their musical spectrum.  
Once again, a stark change of pace ensued as the grungy 
Saratoga punks Candy Ambulance ripped into distorted 
riffs that brought the pace up a few notches. Although 
nothing particularly astonishing instrumentally, the band 
was inherently likeable and their blend of grunge, punk 
and rock had universal appeal. Olivia Quillio, armed with 
just an acoustic guitar and a beautiful set of pipes, followed 
with a sound that one attendee compared to Fiona Apple. 
Her bubbly banter in between songs complemented the 
good-timey aura of the packed living room and her songs 
were met with enthusiastic applause. 
Finally, the staunchly progressive, social justice-
infused three-piece Sons of an Illustrious Father capped 
off the evening with a style that’s difficult to place. 
Miller, positioned behind his drum kit, had somewhat 
of a spoken word vocal delivery, as he alternated verses 
with frontperson and guitarist Lilah Larson. However, the 
music teetered precariously between driving indie rock and 
experimental something or other. 
Regardless, the band didn’t seem particularly concerned 
with articulating a specific style, but rather focused on a 
socially conscious, albeit a tad ostentatious, progressive 
platform they wanted to convey. Despite being a bit heady 
at times, their music was intriguing enough for everyone in 
the room to take something from and the ones who really 
got what they were going for would’ve made the band 
proud. 
The WCPH definitely does things differently than 
most DIY spots. There’s a certain odor of creativity and 
individualism that permeates throughout the building and 
everyone who basked in it that evening left reeking of 
something special. Art is alive and well in Albany.

Finding your voice 
with Pitch Please 

CAMPUS CLUB

By ALLEN ENRIQUEZ

There are many groups and organizations at the 
University at Albany that many students may not know 
about. Some may include groups like the Laser Tag Club, 
the Equestrian team, or the first coed a cappella group, 
Pitch Please.
Pitch Please began in 2013 with only seven members at 
the time, a number that has now increased to 14. 
“They started the group because there was no coed group 
and they were all friends in the MTA department,” said 
current President Cyndie Piscatello. “They just wanted a 
group with musical theater influence and stuff like that.”
Piscatello, a junior, has been a part of Pitch Please ever 
since it was established. She described the group as a bunch 
of musicians who come together to showcase their talent 
and ultimately have a great time doing what they love.
Although the group’s main purpose is for artists to 
express their talent, there are more serious aspects to it. The 
group practices every Tuesday and Thursday for two hours 
and there are attendance policies within the group. The 

group runs on a “three strikes you’re out” policy that leads 
to an executive board decision of whether or not a student is 
in the group anymore. 
“We do have to be strict about it because if kids get lazy 
then they won’t know the music,” said Piscatello. “Then 
when we try to perform and the person who missed the 
practice doesn’t know the music, it messes everyone else up 
and it’s not fair to the group.”
There is an audition process to get into the group. The 
group’s maximum amount of members is 16, otherwise the 
group could turn into a chorus, Piscatello said. 
The audition process begins with the contestant singing a 
song of their choice, followed by testing how high and low 
the singer can go. The group then teaches one of their own 
songs to the singer who has to sing it along with the group 
to see if they blend well. Although a singer may have an 
incredible voice, it may not be the right voice for the group. 
“Sometimes, a voice is so unique that it stands out too 
much and you don’t necessarily want that,” Piscatello said. 
The group mostly performs gigs on campus, but do 
compete yearly in the ICCAS, a national a cappella group 

competition held locally at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute. 
The competition consists of many powerhouse music 
schools across the nation, which makes it tough for Pitch 
Please to achieve a national title, according to Piscatello. 
The group is set to take on the competition once again on 
Feb. 20. 
Not all students in the group want to have a career in the 
music industry. Piscatello, for example, is an accounting 
major and is part of the group for fun. There are only a few 
music majors within the group. The group also helps each 
singer improve in different ways. 
“It really helps train your ear,” Piscatello said. “With no 
background music and just singing, it also improves your 
voice and the ability to blend well with other singers.”
The group is open to new members every semester. 
It tables at the block party UAlbany hosts in the fall and 
also posts on social media when it’s holding tryouts. Pitch 
Please can also be contacted at pitchpleaseua@gmail.com 
or by emailing Piscatello at cpiscatello@albany.edu.

Many college students worry about 
where they may end up post-graduation. In 
the everyday hectic life of a college student, 
there are constant worries of how one 
will pursue a successful career at the end. 
Here’s the story of a University at Albany 
junior whose luck and hard work opened 
numerous doors after being recognized by 
award-winning musician Taylor Swift. 
Zainub Amir, 19, from Delmar, New 
York, graduated Bethlehem High School in 
the spring of 2014. She will be graduating 
a year early from UAlbany in 2017 with a 
bachelor’s degree in finance and marketing, 
due to transferred AP credits from high 
school. So how did Amir end up working 
for Swift even before graduating? 
Back in 2010, Amir began tweeting 
promotions and the latest news on Swift 
and her music from her personal Twitter 
account. When her tweets started receiving 
ample attention in 2012, Amir created a 
fan account called “SimplySfans” - “S” for 
Swift.
Swift noticed “SimplySfans” when Amir 
participated in a Google+ chat where she 
was picked to ask Swift questions regarding 
her album, “Red” (2012). A few months 
after, Swift’s team reached out to Amir 
and asked her to become an official “fan 
ambassador.” Shortly after, Amir spent a 
week in New York City with Swift to live 
tweet her appearances on “Good Morning 
America” and “Live with Regis and Kelly.” 
Amir also had the opportunity to attend 
the American Country Countdown Music 
Awards in 2014 to live tweet red carpet 
events and interview country artists.
Ever since Amir’s success with Swift 
started, many opportunities became 
available to Amir. Teen Huffington Post 
reached out to Amir and she began writing 
articles about entertainment and Swift. She 

also writes for MTV Voices, which is a 
platform where Amir can express herself 
from any perspective. Her article, “This Is 
What It Feels Like to Be a Muslim Growing 
Up in America,” debuted on MTV.com on 
Feb. 14.
Ambassador life for Amir isn’t always 
as exciting as it may seem, she’s usually 
waiting for a call from Swift’s team to 
promote her newest album which happens 
every two years. In the meantime, Amir 
promotes for other companies such as Good 
Morning America, MTV and Madame 
Tussauds.  
“It’s kind of like being a fangirl, but wait 
there’s more,” Amir said.
Trying to balance work with Swift, social 
media, homework and having a social 
life as a teen gets pretty tough for Amir. 
Ever since she decided to graduate early, 
everything in life has been coming at her 
fast, she said.  The only way she combats 
her busy schedule is by planning every 
single hour of her day to organize time for 
homework, tweeting, having a social life 
and family.
Amir’s next steps involve waiting until 
graduation to look into the MBA program 
here at UAlbany and in New York City. A 
publishing company, Simon & Schuster, 
recently signed her to be an official adviser 
for a Taylor Swift Fan Book, expected to 
launch in October of 2016, according to 
Amir. 
Amir’s use of social media helped her 
grow and create a network full of powerful 
contacts. 
At the end of the interview, she provided 
fellow college students with a little advice.
“Network yourself. Use social media to 
your advantage because it may be someone 
that you follow or like, and if they really 
inspire you career goal-wise, talk to them 
and reach out,” Amir said. “Social media is 
stronger than you think it is.”

A night with Oscar

ALBANY INSTITUTE

By ANALUCIA ZEPEDA
 

“Welcome, ladies.”
Diane Shewchuk, the resident curator of the Albany 
Institute of History and Art, beckoned our attention. On 
Wednesday, Feb. 10, a group of about eight women, one 
of whom was accompanied by her husband, sat around a 
conference table. The occasion? The Institute’s special 

Academy Awards-themed event, “A Night with Oscar.”
Several minutes later, she finally brought out what we 
were all waiting to see: an Oscar statuette. The award, 
we learned, was awarded to writer Edwin Burke for his 
contribution to the 1931 film adaptation of the 1928 novel 
“Bad Girl” by Viña Delmar.
The movie, whose title and poster insinuated a theme 
more scandalous than was true, centered around a couple 
who desired to live a comfortable life in New York City 
but became troubled by the realization that they will soon 
become parents.
The film, now 85 years old, still withstands the test of 
time. The jokes and wits force a laugh as well as a cringe 
with their misogynistic overtones while the protagonist 
resiliently promoted her independence at the same time. An 
ironic paradox of themes, “Bad Girl” attempted to redefine 
the meanings of feminism and domesticity, and still does. 
Back at the conference room, we got an opportunity to 
hold the Oscar. The signature gold shell was absent and the 
Oscar appeared in a muddy bronze color with an iridescent 
sheen. 
“He’s been cleaned to death,” joked Shewchuk.
The recipient of the award, Edwin Burke, won the Oscar 
back at the 5th Academy Awards held in 1932. Burke was 
born in 1889 in Albany, eventually moving to New York 
City to pursue his career as a screenwriter. Burke worked 
closely on writing many screenplays that starred America’s 
child star sweetheart, Shirley Temple, including “Bright 
Eyes,” “Now I’ll Tell,” and “The Littlest Rebel.”
In addition to his work in writing more than 30 
screenplays for film between the years of 1928 and 1936, 
Burke was also a successful playwright. He wrote the play 
that inspired the 1940 film “This Thing Called Love,” a 
racy romantic comedy about newlyweds who agree not to 
sleep together for a trial period, a topic considered risqué at 
the time of its release.
After a long and successful career, Burke passed away in 
1944 at the age of 55 in his home in New York City.
Now, nearly 84 years after Burke won his Best Adapted 
Screenplay award for “Bad Girls” at the 5th Academy 
Awards, the 88th Academy Awards will be held this 

upcoming Sunday, Feb. 28.
Although Burke’s films are long in the past, his work 
has been marked in motion picture history, and the Albany 
Institute of History and Art has the Oscar to prove it.

ALBANY LOSES SEASON OPENER 
TO INSTATE RIVALS SYRACUSE

LACROSSE

By CELIA BALF

In-state lacrosse rivals Syracuse 
University and University at 
Albany met Sunday in the Carrier 
Dome for their annual game, 
Syracuse won 16-7. The two teams 
have been playing every year since 
2004, Syracuse leads the series 13-
1. The last and only time UAlbany 
beat Syracuse was in 2013 in a 
double overtime victory 16-15. 
Last year UAlbany had their 
most successful season going 
16-3 overall and standing as the 
best offense in division 1 history 
with 325 goals. Syracuse remains 
a New York powerhouse every 
year and opened up last week 
with an 18-5 win over Siena. The 
Syracuse-Albany game has been 
a longstanding rivalry for players 
and fans alike, this year the Great 
Danes are Thompson-less, so who 
will step up?
In the first half it became 
apparent that Syracuse wasn’t 
going to go down easy. It’s their 
Dome, it’s the programs 100th 
anniversary, and they couldn’t lose 
to Albany, especially without the 

Thompson Trio. 
Ben Williams is known as 
the face-off master for Syracuse 
and freshman Zach Ornstein for 
UAlbany was tested early going 
against a player whose team ranks 
third overall with winning face-
offs, 66.2 percent. Williams won 
the first half with 11 face-offs to 
Ornstein’s 2. 
UAlbany fell behind early to 
goals by junior Jordan Evans for 
Syracuse and senior Tim Barber. 
Bennett Drake for UAlbany 
responded with an unassisted goal 
to put UAlbany on the board. 
Syracuse responded and tallied 
three more goals off of Derek 
Dejoe, Matt Lane and Nick 
Mariano. 
With the score at 5-1 Drake 
tallies another one for UAlbany. 
The spark from Drake got 
sophomores Reh and Fields into 
the game; the duo combined for 
two goals and two assists. 
At the half Syracuse led 7-4 
with senior captain Blaze Riorden 
saving 10 to Syracuse’s Warren 
Hill with one. 
In the second half Albany fell 

behind in the third period 6-12, 
however John Maloney and Eli 
Lasda each added a goal for the 
Great Danes. 
The fourth quarter caused some 
scoring problems for UAlbany, 
and Seth Oakes was the only Great 
Dane able to get one in the net. 
Syracuse converted four more to 
win the game 16-7.  
Sophomore attack Connor 
Fields said, “We really have to 
follow our system more.” By 
system he means their offense and 
how they move the ball. 
“Today we weren’t moving the 
ball how we usually do,” Fields 
said. 
Coach Marr agreed that it 
wasn’t their best game. “It was a 
tough day for us on the defensive 
end,” Marr said. “I don think we 
played well.”
Fortunately, UAlbany’s season 
has just begun and they have a 
handful of games to look forward 
to in the next few months. 
The Great Danes look to bounce 
back next weekend Feb.27 for 
their home opener against Drexel 
at John Fallon Field.

F O L L O W  U S  O N  T W I T T E R  @ S P O R T S _ A S P !

By KELSEY LUKE

Before my body even hit the ground, I knew. I tore my 
ACL.
It wasn’t until I started thinking about the implications 
of a torn ACL – at least eight months out of playing 
soccer, the surgery, the constant rehab – that I started 

crying. Sobbing, I should say. Of course, I still had a small 
glimmer of hope that I was overreacting and my knee was 
only tweaked. All remaining hope was gone by the next 
morning when I got my MRI results.
For the first half of that day, I sat, unmotivated and 
down. I called my dad to tell him the news. Soon, everyone 
in my family knew and I got calls, some saying how sorry 

they were and others like my brother, saying, “Adrian 
Peterson tore his ACL and came back to have a record-
breaking season the next season.” My mom and dad 
reminded me of how many of my friends from soccer have 
gone through an ACL recovery and came back just as 
good, if not better, than before. I tried to take their advice 
and see some light.
Something in my mind clicked. I realized there was 
nothing I could do to change the fact that I had a torn ACL, 
so there was no reason to sulk. Given my competitive 
nature, I decided that this injury was something that I like 
going to beat, just like an opponent in soccer.
A month later, I got surgery. My dad flew out from 
Colorado, where I’m from, to take care of me for the 
week. That is when I decided to look for a silver lining in 
everything through the whole process. This silver lining: 
getting to spend a week with my dad.
Surprisingly, surgery was the easiest part of the whole 
process. The months following consisted of hours of 
physical therapy every day. Despite the fact that I was 
dripping sweat solely from pain, PT was still not the 
hardest part. The hardest thing of it all wasn’t even 
physical, it was mental. The absolute worst part was 
watching my team play and not being a part of it.
Still, I found a silver lining. I had never taken a break 
from soccer that was longer than a couple of weeks in at 
least eight years. It was a unique opportunity to be able to 
just watch my team play for an entire season. I studied the 
players that play in my position (forward). I watched how 
they moved, how they passed, what they did well and what 
they could have done better. Now, I can honestly say that I 
understand my position on the field better than I ever have.
My team had an amazing season. They won the 
America East Conference and went on to face Penn State 
in the tournament. By that time, I had adjusted to being 
a spectator rather than a player, and I felt pure joy and 
excitement watching my team become champions.
I got an uncanny high the first time I was able to touch a 
ball again and actually dribble and shoot. In that moment, 
I knew that it was all of the pain, physical and mental, was 
worth it.
Ten months out of surgery now, I am a different person 
than I was. This was the first hard thing that I had to deal 
with in my life and I learned so much about myself, the 
game, and life in general. I know now that the gift of 
playing soccer, just like anything, can be taken away in a 
split second. Every time I step on the field now, I have a 
new appreciation for the sport and I am here to love every 
second of it. Even though I wasn’t on the field during the 
America East Championship, I still won – I beat the ACL 
tear.

What feels better: 
beating Stony Brook in a 
historic buzzer-beater shot 
to move onto the NCAA 
tournament last year or 
ending their longest active 
winning streak in Division 
1 men’s basketball at 18 
games this year? 
Both must feel pretty 
good. The University at 
Albany men’s basketball 
team beat Stony Brook 
Wednesday night in front 
of a sold-out crowd at 
SEFCU Arena 82-70. 
Peter Hooley stood out 
for the Great Danes with a 
double-double on the night, 
14 points and 12 rebounds. 
Freshman Joe Cremo had 
a team high 16 points for 
UAlbany. The game plan 
for UAlbany seemed to 
be pretty simple: defense, 
defense and more defense. 
A lot of that defense would 
be on Stony Brook’s 
all-time leading scorer 
in Seawolf basketball 
history, Jameel Warney. 
Will Brown’s team held 
him to 14 points and eight 
rebounds. 
UAlbany more notably 
was the second team all 
year to score 80+ points 

on Stony Brook, the other 
being Notre Dame. Hooley, 
Cremo, Stire, Sanders 
and Rowley all recorded 
double digit points on the 
night. The crowd loved 
Hooley’s three three’s and 
Singletary’s two threes. 
The football team dressed 
up as different super heroes 
and gave the basketball 
team the support perhaps 
they were missing all 
season.
Coach Brown thanked 
the football team in the 
press conference for their 
support, “How about our 
football team?!” 
Brown didn’t however 
congratulate his team, 
rather he said they executed 
their game plan but nothing 
has been won yet. Brown 
said Hooley was the one 
who reminded him of that, 
perhaps a reality check 
during the game when the 
game looked like UAlbany 
would walk away with it. 
UAlbany visits UMASS 
Lowell on Feb. 24 who 
is 11-16, 7-7 AE. They 
are looking to continue 
their momentum into the 
remainder of the season and 
win the America East for 
the fourth consecutive year.
