JONES SPEAKS OUT TO MEDIA

By CONNOR MURPHY

Amidst controversy surrounding the 
three University at Albany students set 
to go to trial for filing a false incident 
report among other charges, university 
President Robert J. Jones held a media 
roundtable in his personal office on 
Feb. 26. The afternoon dialogue was 
set to address some of the President’s 
remarks in open letters and videos to the 
student body over a weeks-long police 
investigation into the original reports.
“The events of the last several weeks 
have been very unsettling not only 
for this university but for the entire 
community,” Jones said.
The media event came a day removed 
from a new twist in the assault case, in 
which investigators said the original 
incident report filed by UAlbany student 
Asha Burwell was in contradiction with 
video evidence taken from the university 
shuttle bus. Burwell, along with the 

newly named defendants Ariel Agudio 
and Alexis Briggs, had claimed in their 
Jan. 30 report that they were the victims 
of a racially-motivated assault.
“I feel compassion for anyone who 
feels they are victims of the events that 
occurred over the past few weeks,” Jones 
said.
One major contention in the 
conversation was Jones’s Jan. 30 letter 
to the student body, in which he wrote, 
“Early this morning, three of our students 
were harassed and assaulted while riding 
on a CDTA bus on Western Ave. in 
Albany.”
Jones’s specific wording was 
criticized in an open letter by Jeffrey 
Rosenheck, in which the UAlbany senior 
student wrote to the President, “To me, 
this is not a racial problem. This is not 
a gender problem. This is not a black 
versus white, or male versus female, or 
student versus student problem. This is

Young activists rally to “ban the box” on applications

CAPITOL NEWS

By STEFAN LEMBO-STOLBA

A group of young activists held a “lobby day” in 
Albany’s Capitol building last Monday to ask politicians 
to support a Senate bill that would remove questions 
about criminal history from college applications.
Two-dozen members of Students for Sensible Drug 
Policy (SSDP), an international grassroots organization, 
came together from different universities throughout 
New York, hosting over 10 meetings throughout the 

Capitol. Senate Bill S969, sponsored by Sen. Velmanette 
Montgomery, would amend the current correction and 
executive laws and if passed would legally ban criminal 
history questions from appearing on college admissions 
applications. 
The activists were resolute in their assertion that 
education is a “common sense” means of reducing 
recidivism. 
“Writing off a potentially beneficial student because 
of their past is draconian,” said Emily Lipton, an SSDP 

chapter member at the University of Albany. Lipton 
explained that felons participate in society with everyone 
else and offering them unobstructed access to education 
not only affects the individual, but also benefits society 
as a whole. 
In a meeting with Maureen Centrino, chief of staff 
for Sen. Neil Breslin, the student lobbyists explained 
that citizens with prior criminal histories are in most

Hiring is on the rise and the University 
at Albany’s Office of Career and 
Professional Development is working to 
prepare students for employment both 
during their time at the university and 
afterward. 
In collaboration with the Student 
Association, Career Services hosted 
their job and internship fair on Thursday, 
Feb. 18. The university-wide fair drew 
in roughly 1,700 students who had 
the opportunity to meet with over 160 
employers, according to Noah Simon, 
director of career planning. 
About 60 percent of these employers 
were recruiting students regardless 
of their academic background. At the 
fair, Career Services also sponsored a 
LinkedIn photo booth so students would 
have professional photos to use on their 
profile. 
“Many students have a LinkedIn 
profile, but they don’t know how to 
utilize it effectively. It is about teaching 

students ‘How do I market myself and 
what audience am I marketing myself 
to?’” Simon said. 
Having this vast array of potential 
job opportunities at one time can be 
overwhelming for students, especially 
if they are inadequately prepared for 
the fair. To help, Career Services held a 
resume critique day on Feb 16. Students 
were able to go into the office and have 
their resumes evaluated by outside 
employers. In the days leading up to the 
fair, the office also hosted workshops in 
resume writing and how to effectively 
market oneself to potential employers at 
the job fair. 
“You don’t just wake up and say, ‘I 
know how to write a great resume,’ and 
that’s why we are here,” Simon said. 
“All of these areas we can help you 
with.”

as any internship or job opportunities

WEAPONS ON CAMPUS

By NICK MUSCAVAGE

On Aug. 30, 2013, Alana Urcia, along 
with her sister and friend, took a walk 
through Washington Park to pick hydran-
geas before the flower would be out of 
season.
A junior at the University at Albany, it 
was Urcia’s second year living downtown 
off the main campus and her first year liv-
ing in an apartment. She grew up in New 
York City and never felt unsafe, but her 
perception changed when she was attacked 
by eight teens that night.
They came from the other end of the 
park. Two of them were on bikes and rode 
ahead of the other six to harass and get 
closer to Urcia, her sister and friend - who 
was still clutching onto the freshly picked 
hydrangeas. 
“That’s when we realized something was 
up,” she said. Urcia’s group tried to ignore 
the eight teens, but they persisted, and the 
harassment escalated into an attack. The 
teens punched Urcia in the face, threw her 

friend to the ground, and stole her sis-
ter’s iPhone. The hydrangeas laid strewn 
throughout the street. Urcia remembers 
feeling “absolutely fucking terrified,” and 
two weeks later the three girls all purchased 
pepper spray for self-defense.
The exact number of students at UAlbany 
who own weapons for self-defense purposes 
is difficult to pin, but according to data 
collected by the University Police Depart-
ment between 2010 and 2015, there were 
32 students arrested on campus for having 
a weapon. Only seven of them were booked 
as intent to use. 
During the same time, UPD reported an-
other 26 cases of students found with weap-
ons that did not lead to arrests. Although 
case specifics are not listed in the data, 
according to the penal codes the weapons 
found were either knives, razors, stilettos, 
throwing stars, blunt objects or imitation 
firearms, such as pellet guns. 
“The vast majority of firearms are airsoft,

WRITERS INSTITUTE

By BRITTANY HORTON

Best-selling nonfiction author Jon 
Krakauer hosted a discussion of his new 
book, “Missoula: Rape and the Justice 
System in a College Town,” at Page Hall on 
Tuesday, Feb. 23. 
You may recognize his name from his 
bestseller “Into the Wild” or “Into Thin 
Air.” His newest book explores the ongoing 
problem of sexual assault on college 
campuses. 
The book investigates a series of rape 
cases that occurred in Missoula, Montana 
over a four-year period, focusing primarily 
on the victims and deficiencies of the 
justice system. Much of the book spotlights 
the mishandling of these cases and draws 
attention to the way these women are treated 
by police, defense attorneys and the public 
after reporting the sexual assault. It concludes 
that reporting rape is still a risky move for 
women. Krakauer, known for his obsessive 
nature in investigative journalism, follows 
these cases from beginning to end throughout 
the duration of “Missoula.”
Krakauer explained he was personally 
involved with the topic after hearing that a 
close family friend was sexually assaulted in 
college. 
“It’s a huge problem, the problem of 
sexual assault,” Krakauer said. “No one is 
paying attention to it except for the women. I 
was so ashamed that I was so ignorant of the 
problem. I was angry with myself so I set out 
to learn more about the subject and that really 
was the genesis of this book.” 

Indeed, it is a huge problem. The 
Department of Justice estimated in December 
2014 that 110,000 women between the ages 
of 18 and 24 are raped each year.
CNN reported that after surveying more 
than 150,000 college students in 2015 about 
sexual assault, 23 percent experienced some 
kind of unwanted sexual attention during 
their college years.  During the four years that 
Krakauer researched for this book, there were 
250 reports of rape in Missoula County. 
“I don’t mean to single out Missoula,” 
Krakauer said. “The rape rate is a little less 
than the national average. I think its problems 
with dealing with rape are pretty depressingly 
typical.” 
Much of the book details the difficulty 
of rape cases: There is a strong “he said-she 
said” factor that makes the trials drag on. 
“It’s not too different from other crimes,” 
Krakauer said. “The difference is in other 
crimes, the victim isn’t assumed to be lying.”
The backlash from the book made the 
University of Montana reexamine its code 
regarding sexual contact without consent. Its 
drop in enrollment is speculated to be directly 
connected to their handling of sexual assault 
cases and the media attention derived from 
“Missoula.”  Hopefully, this causes other 
universities to reexamine their code of ethics 
and the politics behind coming forward after 
sexual assault. 
If you have been sexually assaulted and 
need support, please contact the Advocacy 
Center for Sexual Violence located in the 
basement of Indian Quad.

paint guns, that sort of thing,” said Aran 
Mull, deputy chief of UPD.
Overall, there were 74 cases including 
students and non-students that involved 
weapons on campus between those years. 
Of the 74, only two resulted in a felony 
and both were non-students.
In 2010, the felon was a person 
arrested on Freedom Quad for having 
a rifle. In 2014, the felon was someone 
found with a weapon on University 
Drive West after a previous conviction.
When it comes to students arrested 
for weapons, however, Mull said the 
majority of them are found in their dorm 
rooms.
Ashley Jackson, a senior and first 
year student at UAlbany, was found 
with a Taser in her apartment on Empire 
Commons during the fall semester of 
2014. Two UPD officers arrived at her 
door to respond to a report of marijuana 
odor, she said. 
The police “went through a severe 
search and went through my personal 
wallet and found my Taser that was 
hidden and not anywhere in sight for it to 
even be a problem,” but did not come up 
with marijuana, she said.
“I was distraught because I have to 
have my record tarnished because of 
me having a Taser that I’ve never used 
and only have for protection reasons,” 
Jackson said.
Jackson is a transfer student from the 
University of Delaware, a college located 
in a state that permits people to carry 
Tasers, unlike New York.
“There’s been shootings, robberies, 
fights, kidnappings on that campus 
before,” she said, referring to UDel. “I’m 

actually a victim of someone breaking 
into my apartment and stealing my 
MacBook from my house, so ever since 
then I had a Taser.”
UAlbany follows all of New York’s 
laws regarding weapons and, in addition 
to that, it has its own set of rules under 
its code of conduct.
According to the university’s code of 
conduct, UAlbany prohibits any weapon 
on campus, which it includes as any 
object “designed to inflict a wound, 
cause injury, or incapacitate.”
“Those community standards are more 
restrictive than the laws of New York 
State, certainly,” Mull said. “If you’re 
going to carry a weapon, take the time to 
find out if that weapon is legal to carry 
and, frankly, realize that legality changes 
with every state. Every state has slightly 
different laws.”
In 2012, the FBI calculated Albany’s 
violent crime rate at 802 per every 
100,000, burglary at 887, rape at 43 and 
murder at 4.
The same data put the violent crime 
rate of Albany, a city with a population 
at the time of 98,187, at 802. When 
simplified, the chances of being a victim 
is one in every 123 violent crimes — 
which, in the FBI definition, includes 
murder, rape, robbery, and aggravated 
assault. 
Urcia considers herself 
“hypersensitive” now after she was 
attacked in Washington Park. She 
believes students should be able to have 
pepper spray for self-defense, but that 
there should be lines drawn on other 
forms of protection.
In a story she wrote for a class at 
UAlbany, she said, “Now, we all walked 
around with pepper spray in our bags, 
our phones tucked away in our pockets, 
and a small twitch of the eye that 
consistently checked our surroundings.”

   Thus NYSUNY 2020 began.
But has UAlbany passed the 
performance-based funding test 
to earn a renewal of the program 
in the eyes of Gov. Andrew 
Cuomo? Of course he would 
have to look at our school’s 
greatest accomplishments this 
year to be able to decide that.
UAlbany Pres. Robert J. Jones 
released the “2015-2016 New 
York State Enacted Budget” on 
the university’s website detailing 
overall expenses on a few things 
our school takes pride in. 
Construction of the NYSTAR 

Center of Excellence received 
$250,000 in funding. Upon 
completion of the center, it 
will become one of the largest 
concentrations of environmental 
and atmospheric researchers 
in the country. The Center for 
Autism and Related Disabilities, 
where students can visit for 
support and receive graduate and 
undergraduate training, received 
$1.7 million. The College of 
Emergency Preparedness, 
Homeland Security and Cyber 
Security got $15 million. The 
creation of these majors is a 
movement to introduce new 

employment opportunities to 
students. And $1.02 billion was 
awarded to UAlbany students 
through the Tuition Assistance 
Program (TAP).
If the school receives the 
projected $55 million, which 
will be a $20 million increase 
from what was received in 2011, 
it plans to enact programs to 
provide economic growth to the 
Capital Region. But how exactly 
will those millions of dollars 
affect UAlbany students? 
Based on the way the school 
has spent last year’s money, 
the best majors to get into right 
now are cyber security and 
atmospheric science. Business 
and law are also good choices 
now that the Albany Law School 
is open to UAlbany students for 
classes as of last year. Perhaps 
in the future, if the program is 
renewed, we could see money 
being used for other departments. 
Over the next few years, the 
school could become better-
rounded out with proper funding 
in the fine arts, computer 
science, medical, and journalism 
departments, just to name a few. 

Besides providing more 
money to renovate the plants 
that surround the fountain again, 
NYSUNY 2020 will also have 
a large impact on our tuition. In 
fact, according to UAlbany’s 
grant proposal in 2012, one 
of the primary functions of 
NYSUNY 2020 is to increase 
tuition by a set amount for every 
round of the program. 
The proposal promises 
that “[UAlbany’s] revenue is 
estimated to increase by $300 per 
year for in-state undergraduate 
students.” Graduate and out-
of-state students will have their 
tuition increased by a percentage 
approved by the SUNY Board 
of Trustees. This was the only 
source of revenue listed to cover 
spending on faculty, researchers, 
supporting staff, financial aid, 
and operational costs of new 
programs.
The problem for students is 
that if the challenge is restored 
under the same model, a student 
that is currently a freshman can 
expect to pay at least $7,670 in 
their senior year for tuition. That 
does not include fees, room and 

board, or meal plans. 
That student would also 
have had to move off campus 
by junior year to accommodate 
the wave of incoming students 
UAlbany expects for 2017-2018, 
as detailed in the proposal. To 
avoid that headache, they could 
apply to be a residential assistant.
The name of the game here is 
change. 
This challenge will make 
UAlbany feel completely 
different three to four years 
from now. There may be new 
buildings around campus, 
more subjects to major 
in, appropriately funded 
departments, and perhaps a 
Starbucks on campus. 
But of course the spending of 
the $55 million is up to Jones 
and the financial officers in the 
Board of Trustees. I hope they 
decide to use a portion of it for 
something that the collective 
student body can take pride in 
rather than something that a set 
group of professors will take 
pride in and present at the next 
board meeting for more money. 

T

he University at Albany was among three 
other SUNY schools in 2011 to evenly split 
$140 million given to them by the New 
York state Governor’s Office as a challenge. 
According to the SUNY website, the schools 
were told to use the money “to support capital 
projects in their region.” This was only round 
one of the five-year test to see if the governor can 
provide economic growth to a region through the 
funding of New York State schools.

they go to sleep. But who’s going to take a 
shower when the water is freezing?
It’s an added obstacle to the bathroom 
routine and, for those living on campus, 
it’s far more complicated. Students living 
in the dorms have to fight their roommates 
for the bathroom, but there’s a chance the 
fights become meaningless, as the victor 
might not be able to even use the bathroom 
properly.
There is the option of proceeding with 
life and accepting that showering will not 
happen, going about one’s day hoping no 

one smells any body odor in the meantime. 
It’s safe to say no one is going to reek if 
they don’t shower for a day, or at least I 
hope so. If anything, perfume, cologne and 
Febreeze can be of assistance for a while. 
Nevertheless, some people can’t go on 
with their day normally without showering. 
Although no one can necessarily tell if a 
person has showered or not, the person who 
didn’t shower knows. And for some reason, 
the slight layer of grime is preventing that 
person from operating at full capacity. 
Nonetheless, this is nothing to new to 
me. I grew up in a house that wouldn’t 
have hot water sometimes. When that 
situation arose, I would have an alternative. 
I would boil water and go on with what I 
refer to as a “pot shower.” However, there 
is no alternative here at the University at 
Albany: We are all obligated to play the 
waiting game.

It’s either “get ready and go to class” or 
“wait five more minutes for the hot water.” 
Five minutes becomes 30 minutes and still 
no hot water and now, the said student is 
both late and unsatisfied.
It’s a stalling process that starts a 
domino effect. For those who refuse to 
press forward and decide to wait for the 
hot water to return, it could potentially 
interfere with their schedule, which in 
turn could interfere with someone else’s 
schedule. Some people rely on the idea 
that the other person is on time so that they 
can operate. And if the person waiting for 
hot water actually gets it during another 
person’s showering time, conflict ensues.
For those who think they can shower in 
their friend’s room, chances are they don’t 
have hot water either and no one is going 
to trek to another hall or quad, nor should 
someone resort to doing that. 

People could actually attempt a cold 
shower and disregard the health problems 
for the sake of cleanliness. However, it’s 
highly unlikely someone is going to endure 
the cold water just to go out into the cold 
air. It’s winter and we want hot showers, or 
at least moderately warm ones. 
No one wants a shower to match winter 
temperature.
It’s fathomable for hot water to be gone 
a few times, but this occurrence has far 
surpassed that by now. It’s gotten to a 
point where students are assuming that 
the hot water will be absent, longer being 
a surprise. It’s hard enough being college 
students, but now we are dirty college 
students. Although it’s an exaggerated 
statement, college students are paying for 
this, so we don’t expect mediocrity from 
this campus lifestyle, and that includes hot 
water.

he Educational Opportunity 
Program (EOP) on campus 
provides economically 
disadvantaged college applicants a fair 
opportunity to apply and get accepted into 
a university that they could not ordinarily 
afford.
   According to the SUNY website, a 
student’s household income cannot 
surpass $21,978 for a household size of 
one, $29,637 for a household size of two, 
37,296 for a household size of three, and 
so on.
   The qualifications for an EOP applicant 
are far lower than that of the average 
student. The University at Albany grade 
qualification requirement is between 80 
and 89, or a general B average.
   In theory, the EOP program has plenty 
of quality attributes, providing students 
who do not have many benefits an equal 
chance to earn a good education. I don’t 
disbelieve that the EOP should not exist 
entirely. It offers a helping hand for those 
who did not believe that they could make 
it this far.
    “This program is one that provides life 
changing support that cultivates students 
from less fortunate backgrounds into 
successful professionals and leaders after 
graduation,” SUNY blog writer James 
Sanchez says.
   However, I believe that the 
qualifications limit some students who 
are not able to apply through the EOP 
program.
   “EOP could be problematic due to 
the nature of taking both income and 

grades into play. By taking someone of 
similar income and excluding them due 
to academic excellence,” 21-year-old 
communications major, Alexander Lopez, 
says.
    I have to agree with Lopez. It is easy 
to see how the program offers immense 
support for those who cannot afford 
higher education nor have the grades to 
get in. But, there are students on campus 
who may fit one or the other, but not both. 
Now we must shift our attention to those 
who have the qualifying grades to get into 
the university traditionally but do not have 
the finances readily available to afford 
college.
   Because GPA is also factored into 
whether a student can apply for the EOP 
program, a student who has above average 
grades loses a chance at one of 2,500 
spots open, despite being in a low income 
household with the inability to afford 
school without the need for thousands of 
dollars in loans.     
   It is also worth mentioning that students 
in the EOP program also get extra grant 
money, including stipends for books 
to help alleviate the costs of education. 
Meanwhile, traditional students are forced 
to either pay the pricey cost of textbooks 
at the bookstore or find alternative means 
to get a book cheap from a third party 
vendor.
   Lopez compared EOP to Affirmative 
Action, a bill that allows minorities to 
have a fair chance in college admissions 
and the workplace. The downside to 
Affirmative Action is that it may pool a 
collection of minority people who may not 
be as qualified as their white counterparts.

   Similarly, EOP is a smaller pool of 
students with specific, albeit somewhat 
underwhelming, characteristics that denies 
other, more qualified students of the 
financial benefits that they might need.
   This is not to say that EOP has done it 
all wrong. It provides a wonderful outlet 
to achieve the same level of success as a 
student who can get into school based on 
his or her merit alone. 

   But I’ll say it: I want to reap the 
financial benefits that the EOP students 
get to have, too. Money is just as hard 
to come by for me and I don’t think I 
am alone in saying that I believe other 
students should also get some extra 
financial advantage, especially when their 
income fits the bill for an EOP student.
   The fight to be fair isn’t quite there.

VIDEO GAMES

THE NEW HIT OF INDIE GAMING

By JARAN CHANCE

Independent game design is not as glamorous as it 
sounds. In fact, most of the time it’s really just a group of 
everyday people who decided to quit their jobs, rent an 
office space and make a video game. 
That is who Campo Santo are, the developers behind the 
new hit game “Firewatch,” which saw its global release this 
month on Windows, OS X, Linux and Playstation 4.
“Firewatch” caught a lot of eyes at last year’s Electronic 
Entertainment Expo amid the explosion of narrative game 
announcements. This is the first ever video game release 
for both Campo Santo and Panic software publishing. 
“Firewatch” is very much so an indie game with an 
underfunded team of average Joes working around the 
clock and should be received as such. 
In this first person adventure game, players take on the 
role of a volunteer fire lookout named Henry who decides 
to spend his summer in the isolation of the Wyoming 
Wilderness in 1989. 
The game introduces players to Henry’s past through 
a brief introductory menu. The menu is simply a purple 

background, pub noises and white text detailing the events 
in Henry’s life that led him to here. This feature feels like a 
last minute inclusion and does not fit comfortably into the 
gameplay. Luckily, this is the only time this menu appears 
in the game.
 After the excruciating menu sequence, players are free 
to enjoy the gorgeous world Campo Santo has created and 
what a vibrant world they made. There is also an entire 
original score recorded to accompany the player on their 
exploration, successfully emphasizing the beauty of some 
moments and the anxiety of the more dramatic ones. 
The graphics look very similar to that of “Team Fortress 
2” with blocky fingers and cartoony objects but the way 
they chose to present these graphics in such spectacular 
surroundings makes for a truly unique aesthetic. 
Campo Santo, the San Francisco based developer 
responsible for creating the game, is founded by Jake 
Rodkin and Sean Vanaman. Rodkin and Vanaman were 
the creative leads for the hit game “The Walking Dead,” 
produced by Telltale Games. The game play is similar to 
the recently popular entries from Telltale Games in which 
players are given a few dialogue choices and a limited 

amount of time to answer or face the dreaded “Fine, I 
guess you have nothing to say” option. Although just like 
Telltale’s design, these options have little to no effect on 
the outcome of the game. Each dialogue option craftily 
leads the player to believe they chose the path that the 
developer intended. 
Beside the narrative options, Firewatch shares little 
more similarities with Telltale’s games, instead sending 
the player on an exploration adventure. The gameplay is 
mostly hiking around the trails with a map, compass and 
walkie-talkie. There is no action or fighting as it is simply 
a narrative, uncovering a mystery and seeing it to its 
conclusion.
 The largest complaint seen for the game is the play time 
of around three to four hours. Yes, Campo Santo could 
have diluted the story, delaying the player from reaching 
their goal or making new ones, but in the end the decision 
to leave the story as it was rings truer than that of most 30-
hour narrative games. 
This is a truly promising sign from Campo Santo and 
with any luck, a clear indication of what to expect for this 
company.

Michale Graves, ex-Misfit delivers 
intimate performance at Madison Theater

By LOUIS SMITH

Albany’s historic Madison Theater was invaded by 
aging punks and hipsters on Saturday, Feb. 20 to witness 
the performance put on by estranged ex-Misfits lead singer 
Michale Graves. 
The New Jersey native joined the horror-punk pioneers 
in 1995 during the band’s reformation and then left the 
group with then drummer Dr. Chud in 2000. Since his split 
with the band, Graves went on to pursue a successful solo 
career, releasing a number of solo records and even teamed 
up with Marky Ramone to tackle vocal responsibilities 
during the “Marky Ramone’s Blitzkrieg” project and tour. 
The Madison Theater show kicked off his “When Worlds 
Collide Tour,” named after his latest solo album, and 
includes over 50 dates throughout the United States, with 
a second date in Albany later on April 28 at The Fuze Box. 
His current touring lineup consists of Loki, JV Bastard and 
Tony Bones.
Graves and his crew arrived at the theater a bit later 
than initially quoted by the staff, but none of the attendees 
seemed to mind. When an unmarked van arrived in front of 
the well-lit venue, Graves could be seen unloading amps, 
hauling drum equipment and helping to set merchandise up. 
The man was literally running around the entire venue, 
where a crowd of roughly 60 patrons patiently sat in the 
seats of the partially full movie theater, drinking their beer 
or liquor, and smoking cigarettes outside to give the band 
time to get set up. Green light bathed the vacant stage 
which sat under a dark projection screen. Motorhead tracks 
blared through the house speakers while the band members 
silently assembled their gear. In light of Lemmy Kilmister’s 
recent passing, someone in the crowd yelled “We miss you 
Lemmy!” right before the house music was killed for the 
evening. 
Sometime after 10 p.m., the demon known as Michale 
Graves emerged from a small opening in the wall behind 
the drums. No makeup, no fancy outfit—just a man with 
the voice of a god. Graves belted through renditions of 
classic Danzig-era Misfits cuts which included  “Static 
Age,” “Night of the Living Dead” and “TV Causality,” all 

of which were performed with eerie accuracy and stunning 
intensity. Graves and his band also performed songs from 
his time spent with the Misfits, which included sterling 
takes of “Living Hell,” “Fiend Club” and “Speak of the 
Devil.” 
Now 40 year old, Graves still possesses the stunning 
vocal abilities he had in his youth that helped rekindle the 
flame of the Misfits back in the ’90s. That very vocal work 
was almost hypnotic during their performance, while the 
band blitzed through their set list with a ferocity that rivals 
that of the current “Misfits” incarnation headed by bass 
player Jerry Only. 
“Walk Among Us,” “Scream,” “Die Monster Die,” 
and “Dig Up Her Bones” commanded massive crowd 
response and Graves ended his onslaught with an encore 
performance of “Saturday Night” which was the perfect 
way to cap off a night of Misfits tracks. 
Once their set list had completed, Graves jet offstage to 
the lobby-area where the merchandise table he had helped 
set up earlier was waiting and proceeded to autograph 

photos and thank everyone personally who came out to 
support him and the band.  
T-shirts, CDs, tour posters and photography were 
presented to eager fans for their purchase as Graves, armed 
with a silver permanent marker, took a vested interest in the 
individuals who had turned up for the show. Unlike other 
punk-rock idols who may go and hide on their tour busses 
or unwind in the infamous “green rooms” of rock-club 
venues, Graves was visible, coherent and present. A man 
who is truly there for the fans.
For those Fiends who missed this performance, make 
sure you come and support Graves in April when his tour 
revisits the Capital Region and occupies The Fuze Box. 
Being an avid Misfits fan for the past 11 years, and having 
seen Jerry Only’s touring version of the band twice, I 
can say that any regular fan should make a point to see 
Graves play. Unlike Only’s “Misfits” shows that rely 
on extravagant makeup, costumes and stage decoration, 
Graves simple rock-n-roll delivery easily overshadows that 
of the current Misfits touring performance.

POP CULTURE

By AMANDA CASE

Pop star Kesha Rose Serbert, formerly known as Ke$ha, 
28, has been fighting for her freedom after claiming that 
her producer at Sony Music, Dr. Luke (Lukasz Gottwald), 
drugged and raped her a decade ago and has been 
committing ongoing abuse toward her.
Last week, Manhattan Supreme Court Justice Shirley 
Kornreich denied the “Tik Tok” singer’s request to void 
her contract with Gottwald after she accused him back in 
October 2014. 
“You’re asking the court to decimate a contract that was 
heavily negotiated and typical for the industry,” Kornreich 
said to Kesha’s attorney, Mark Geragos.
Kornreich also told Geragos that prior information 
“decimates [his] argument” and added that her “instinct is 
to do the commercially reasonable thing.”
Gottwald denied all accusations and has reportedly 
invested $60 million into Kesha’s career. According to the 
New York Daily News, Kesha’s contract states she will 
have to produce six more albums with the label. 
However, after the ruling, Gottwald’s lawyer, Christine 
Lepera, released a statement, saying that “the New York 
County Supreme Court on Friday found that Kesha is 
already ‘free’ to record and release music without working 
with Dr. Luke as a producer if she doesn’t want to, any 
claim that she isn’t ‘free’ is a myth.”
The statement also brought up that Kesha never reported 
abuse or rape to any law enforcement authority or to Sony 
Music, and also had sworn under oath in 2011 that it never 
actually occurred. 
Back in June 2015, Los Angeles Superior Court judge 
Barbara Scheper noted that there was “no evidence to 
support her assertion that the agreements were not entered 
into freely or voluntarily as a result of arm’s length 
negotiations.” 
Geragos told Billboard in a statement that the lawsuit 
was “a wholehearted effort by Kesha to regain control of 

her music career and her personal freedom after suffering 
for ten years as a victim of mental manipulation, emotional 
abuse and sexual assault at the hands of Dr. Luke.” 
He went onto say that Kesha is “focused on moving her 
life and her career beyond this terrible time.” 
The ruling against Kesha has outraged her fans and 
resulted in the fan-led #FreeKesha campaign on social 
media. She has also received outpouring support from 
fellow celebrities such as Demi Lovato, Lady Gaga, Lorde, 
Kelly Clarkson, Adele and more. Singer Taylor Swift 
recently showed her support by donating $250,000 to Kesha 

“to help with any of her financial needs during this trying 
time,” according to a statement from Swift’s publicist.
“I’m on Kesha’s side,” said University at Albany senior 
Meagan Callahan. “I understand she is under contract with 
the producer, but Dr. Luke should face jail time.”
Michelle Minissale, also a senior at UAlbany, said “I 
can’t believe they won’t break her contract. She needs all 
the support she can get and it’s unfortunate she won’t be 
getting that from her label.”
Since the ruling, Scott A. Edelman, an attorney 
representing Sony, has spoken out saying, “Sony is 
doing everything it can to support the artist in these 
circumstances, but is legally unable to terminate the 
contract to which it is not a party.” The label can’t 
terminate Kesha’s contract because it belongs to Gottwald’s 
company, Kasz Money, which has a separate deal with 
Sony’s RCA/Jive subsidiary.
Earlier this week, Gottwald tweeted “I didn’t rape Kesha 
and I have never had sex with her. Kesha and I were friends 
for many years and she was like my little sister.”
Kesha also spoke about her relationship with Sony on 
Facebook this week saying “All I ever wanted was to 
be able to make music without being afraid, scared, or 
abused.” 
In the same post, she expressed gratitude towards her 
fans by writing “I’m so, so beyond humbled and thankful 
for all of the support I’ve received from everyone. Words 
cannot really express the emotions I’ve gone through 
reading and seeing how amazing everyone has been to me. 
I can’t believe that so many people all over the world took 
the time to show me support and love. Other entertainers 
who knowingly put their own careers at stake by supporting 
me, I will be forever grateful.”
She also encouraged others who have been abused to not 
be afraid to speak out. 
“I for one, will stand beside you and behind you,” she 
said. “I know now how this all feels and will forever fight 
for you the way perfect strangers have been fighting for 
me.”

RISING INDIE BAND PINEGROVE 
PLAYS AT SKIDMORE COLLEGE

Kesha has a six album-contract with Sony.

By ELI ENIS

Guided only by the minimal information provided on 
a Facebook event page that was created just days before 
and a lust for catching one of indie punk’s latest buzz 
bands, a flock of Albany kids congregated with Skidmore 
College’s best-informed hipsters last Thursday on the 
Skidmore campus. Pinegrove, the Montclair, New Jersey 
brainchild of frontman Evan Stephens Hall, have been 
gaining notoriety within the indie and punk scene over 
the past few months and just released their first proper 
full-length a couple weeks back via the respected Run For 
Cover Records (Modern Baseball, Turnover, Basement). 
The band has been playing various one-off shows 
at colleges and small venues since the album, titled 
“Cardinal,” dropped in mid-February, and Skidmore 
College was lucky enough to snag them for what appeared 
to be a very last minute arrangement. 
Unlike the cramped basement they played in Albany 
last October, the multi-purpose event hall at Skidmore 
was at least three times the size and actually included 
a small stage setup. Positioned in front of a gray stone 
fireplace that was partially strung with colored Christmas 
lights, the performance area was spacious and inviting, as 
the relatively tall ceilings opened the room up to provide 
proper lighting. The building resembled a generic town 
park lodge, and the fact that it was set off to the side of 
the other buildings and was surrounded by trees created a 

peaceful, natural atmosphere that was a pleasing contrast 
to the urban environment of Albany’s DIY venues. 
The first of two opening acts began their set with 
essentially no warning and the frontman, who dressed like 
he just stepped off the set of “Dazed and Confused,” asked 
the audience to “close your eyes and imagine you’re on an 
albatross flying through space.” 
Whether it was one of the audience members or the 
band themselves, the room immediately began to reek 
of weed as they jammed through a half-hour’s worth 
of psychedelic rock a la Jimi Hendrix. Although a 
completely different sound than Pinegrove, the four-piece 
were really talented and didn’t seem too out of place 
against the following acts. 
After their set the size of the crowd instantly tripled as 
roughly 50 students arrived to catch Mal Devisa, a solo act 
who roared through a series of tense, emotional songs that 
were carried only by the plucking of a bass guitar. Her 
powerful voice was capable of ascending multiple ranges 
within each short outburst and then quickly dropping 
back down to a murmur, sometimes pausing for upwards 
of five seconds, leaving the audience on edge before 
shattering the silence with her next line. Again, musically 
incomparable to Pinegrove, but thoroughly impressive. 
As Hall and company took the stage and began ripping 
into “Old Friends,” one of the catchier, upbeat songs on 
“Cardinal,” it was clear that most of the audience had no 
idea who Pinegrove were. Perhaps expecting something 

a bit more fast-paced, half of the roughly 70 attendees 
snuck out after the first few songs. The band remained 
unfazed, almost purposely unaware of the cluster of 
captivated audience members intently head-bobbing along 
to their twangy, mid-paced indie numbers. Save for a 
few moments of casual banter between songs, the band 
played through 12 tunes almost non-stop, which included 
a good portion of “Cardinal,” as well as some other back-
catalogue material. 
Pinegrove is a unique blend of indie rock, emo 
and punk, and a heavy splash of country and folk, 
which makes their audience just as mutt-like as their 
sonic output. Their narrative lyrical style can also be 
overwhelming at first, making it difficult to take it all 
in on first listen. It’s definitely easier to appreciate their 
live performance with a knowledge of their material, 
especially during the middle of the set when the slower 
songs start to mush together. 
They ended with “Cardinal” closer “New Friends” and 
older, fan-favorite “Recycling,” which are two of their 
rockier songs. The band picked up the pace during those 
two and ended the set with a smiling, satisfied crowd that 
mirrored the warm grin of the band and inspired a current 
of bodies to wash over their merch table and snag a token 
of appreciation. Seeing a band like Pinegrove do as well 
on the outskirts of the Capital Region as they did in the 
heart of it was a heartwarming portrayal of the ever-
increasing reach of DIY music in Upstate New York.

Although this was a relatively small show, Pinegrove are gearing up for their biggest tour yet next month with Into It. Over It. and The World Is a Beautiful Place & I am No 
Longer Afraid to Die.

about what is right. This is about due 
process.”
When asked if he would’ve changed 
the wording in the original letter, 
Jones replied, “Absolutely not…
hindsight is always 20/20 they say, 
but I would not at this juncture do 
anything different, because as I said in 
the opening remarks, we had to go with 
the information we had to go with the 
information we had in hand.”
In a few of the remarks Jones made 
during the roundtable, Jones seemed 
hesitant or forgetful in his review of 
the evidence. “I’ve seen the video from 
the news reports,” he said. Jones didn’t 
give an answer when asked of the first 
time he saw the video evidence, but did 
add: “I was not involved in the DA’s 
office.”
“In meeting with the police, they 

gave us a brief overview of the CDTA 
tape initially as the information became 
available,” Jones said.
On the question of whether or not the 
three students would be expelled, Jones 
explained that he could not comment 
on the situations of specific students by 
law and the student’s code of conduct. 
He added that the student conduct 
review process had no timeframe, 
citing that it was being handled on a 
systematic level. That review process is 
not related to the court process in any 
way, explained the President.
The alleged 19 year-old victim 
in the new case against the three 
UAlbany women is not a student of the 
university, according to Jones.
Jones closed the roundtable 
pointing out that the CDTA-university 
relationship is a crucial part of getting 
students to and from school. “As far 
as we know, they’re a safe form of 
transportation.”

cases less apt to re-commit crimes on 
college campuses. The activists went 
on to explain that barring access to 
education based on criminal histories is 
a detrimental practice that continues the 
cycle of poverty and oppression. 
“Access to higher education is 
highly correlated to economic stability 
and social mobility. It is also linked 
to reduced recidivism for people with 
past criminal justice involvement,” said 
Montgomery.
The campaign to remove questions 
about criminal history on job 
applications is a national movement 
known as “ban the box.” The movement 
has recently included colleges in the 
conversation, in hopes of clearing the 
pathway to education for people with 
criminal records.

The origins of criminal record 
inquiry on college applications date 
back to a 1980s murder of a college 
student at Lehigh University, according 
to The New York Times. In 1998 the 
SUNY system adopted the practice 
of asking about felony convictions 
and in 2006 the Common Application 
followed suit. 
When asked what compelled them 
to lobby for this issue one “lobby 
day” participant spoke of his friends 
who have criminal records and the 
trouble they encountered in the college 
application process. Robert Belpasso, 
a student at New York University, said 
his involvement was to “support [the] 
marginalized communities” that are 
adversely affected by bars to education. 
The SSDP chapter at UAlbany 
will continue to lobby for this issue 
and have another meeting scheduled 
in March to speak with Bill S969’s 
sponsor Sen. Montgomery.

According to a report released by the 
National Association of Colleges and 
Employers, the job market is expected 
to hire 11 percent more college 
graduates from the class of 2016 than 
it did from the prior year’s graduating 
class.
While this is good news, Simon 
still encourages all students to become 
familiar with online tools as well as 

those provided through Career Services. 
Freshmen can meet with a career 
adviser to figure out what major is right 
for them and the job opportunities that 
come with it, especially since students 
don’t need to major in the exact field 
they want to work in. 
“I always tell students in every 
industry there is every job function,” he 
said. “So understanding how to do a job 
search and understanding how to target 
it is critical.”
The next university-wide job fair will 
be held in the fall, but Career Services 
is open Monday through Friday from 
9 a.m. to 5 p.m. in SLG50 and is eager 
to help students in any step of the job 
application process. 
Whether students need help fine-
tuning their resume, preparing for 
an interview or are in the process of 
applying to graduate school and need 
assistance with their personal statement, 
all they have to do is log onto 
Handshake to make an appointment 
with a career adviser.

What an emotional roller 
coaster that was. This 
Drexel game was circled 
on our schedules for a long 
time. There always seems 
to be bad blood between 
us as programs and it even 
trickles down to the new 
guys on both teams. Safe to 
say that it was easy to get 
up for a game like this. The 
vibe all week at practice 
was very positive and 
upbeat, even despite the 
disappointing performance 
at Syracuse. The loss last 
weekend was not who we 
are as a team. We worked 
on simple things in practice 
and it really paid off on 
Saturday. 
The game itself was very 
back and forth. In the first 

quarter we came out strong, 
only to find ourselves down 
by two or three at one point 
in the second quarter. We 
had to dig deep and show 
some resilience to get the 
win. The older guys on our 
team knew that this Drexel 
team doesn’t quit so they 
made sure our minds were 
right. As a junior I tried to 
convey this message to the 
younger players. The back 
and forth affair continued 
to add to the energy all 
game long, this is what 
we play the game for. The 
whole bench was fired 
up all game long, giving 
us a much needed boost 
to help close that game 
out. The fourth quarter 
we dominated with seven 
goals to their one. This was 
UAlbany lacrosse.

ATHLETE’S CORNER

By LAMYA ZIKRY

The University at Albany 
Women’s Lacrosse team was itching 
to get its season started after months 
of practices and one scrimmage 
against Harvard. 
Despite excitement and readiness 
for their first test Saturday, Feb. 27 
against Cornell, the result did not 
end in their favor. The Great Danes 
fell 9-5.
Head coach John Battaglino hopes 
they can pick up where they left off 
last year. “We’re a pretty dangerous 
team. We can move the ball around 
well and I think we can be fun to 
watch,” he said.
“Practice has been tough mentally 
and physically especially since other 
teams have started playing games 
already,” said senior Rachel Bowles. 
“Having weeks of practices can be 
tiring for everyone. But I’m excited 
that we finally get to show everyone 
how hard we’ve been working.” 
Bowles certainly has been working 
hard and was recently named to the 
Tewaaraton Top 50 watch list. 
Dakota Savitcheff, a junior who 
plays on the attack agrees with 
Bowles. “So far practice has been 
going really well. We have practice 
Monday through Saturday and lift on 
Tuesday and Thursday which makes 
it both mentally and physically 
exhausting.”
The team’s practices have been 
focused around their offensive 
plays and moving people around 
to different positions to see where 
their chemistry is. They’ve also been 
watching film to help scout other 
teams. 
Savitcheff says they do a lot of 
shooting and transition drills to help 

them out with both their build up to 
the attack and then the final piece, 
scoring. “One thing that helps a lot 
is scrimmaging to see how we play 
full field and it’s also more game 
like which helps us get a better feel 
for playing other teams,” Savitcheff 
said.
Lacrosse falls in that awkward 
period between winter and spring, 
where the weather is hormonal, 
therefore the team has been adapting 
with the inconsistencies. 
Battaglino says that even though 
the weather has been warmer than 
usual, it’s very difficult to get things 
done. He says it has been very 
windy, cold, and rainy so it’s tough 
to get quality practices.
“You’re trying to teach and talk 
through things and you can’t in this 
weather,” said Battaglino. He also 
worries about the players and puts 
them into consideration since they 
don’t have gloves or helmets. “The 
wind goes right through them and 
they’re holding down on a metal 
stick, so it’s uncomfortable,” he said.
Savitcheff says they practiced in 
the bubble for the first couple weeks 
then went outside but it became 
unbearingly cold.  This past week’s 
practice has been at an indoor 
facility off campus. Playing indoors 
allows Battaglino to communicate 
clearer with the girls without the 
interruption of the wind, rain, sleet 
or snow. When they do play outside, 
Bowles said they stick to full field 
drills because it’s more realistic and 
beneficial than struggling to hear the 
coaches talk about tactics.
Savitcheff loves practicing with 
the team, but she also likes the 
competition and excitement of game 
day. 

Bowles is looking forward to 
the same thing. “This year we start 
out with tough games but it is good 
competition to see where we are at 
going into the season,” she said.
Bowles and Savitcheff, now 
as upperclassmen help the 
underclassmen with the transition 
from high school lacrosse to college 
lacrosse. Throughout the fall season 
is the time when the team gets 
close hopefully building a strong 
foundation for when the regular 
season starts. 
Someone to definitely keep an eye 
on is sophomore, Allie Jimerson.  
Bowles said she is an all-around 
great player. “She sees the field 
better than anyone on this team.  She 
knows when people are going to be 
open and is able to create plays for 
herself and other players,” she said. 
Savitcheff said another person 
to be on the lookout for is Bowles. 
Savitcheff said she has always been 
their key player and this is her last 
year playing with them. Savitcheff 
said being named in the Tewaaraton 
Top-50 watch list means Bowles 
is one of the best players in the 
country.
Bowles is honored to be named on 
the list. “I would never have received 
any awards or acknowledgments 
without the help of my teammates,” 
she said.  In her opinion, they are 
successful because they play well 
together on the field and she’s 
excited to see what they can bring to 
the table this year.
This season they have seven 
scheduled home games and eight 
away games. Their next game is 
an away game on Friday, March 4 
against Elon.

Women’s lacrosse gets

The Danes have recently been forced to practice inside due to inclement weather conditions, but that didn’t stop 
them from getting ready for their season, which started with a home game against Cornell last Saturday.

one of them--the 2014-15 
season. Stony Brook enters 
the postseason as the No. 1 
seed and favorite to qualify 
for the NCAA tournament.
Brown, who has brought 
five different UAlbany 
teams to the Big Dance, 
said he believes “his 
team is built for playoff 
basketball.” He is sure of 
it, because he knows his 
seniors know what it takes 
to win the America East 
championship. 
Sanders said the team is 
playing its best basketball 
right now. Hooley, who has 
won the tournament three 
times, knows the team can’t 
get ahead of themselves.
“We can’t take anything 
for granted,” the fifth-
year senior said. “We 
can’t even think about the 
championship right now.”
It’s all on the line for the 
seniors, whose UAlbany 
careers will end with the 
Danes’ next loss.
“It’s gonna be tough to 
leave this place. We don’t 
want to leave any time 

soon,” Hooley said.
Luckily for Hooley and 
the other seniors, UAlbany 
will play at SEFCU Arena 
for at least the quarterfinals 
and semifinals, should 
they win against Hartford. 
The location of the 
championship game 
depends on whoever the 
higher seed is, which 
would be Stony Brook if 
they advance to the final. 
A UAlbany-Stony Brook 
rematch is the contest every 
America East fan wants to 
see after last year’s miracle 
at SEFCU Arena, when 
Hooley buried the game-
winning three that will live 
in March Madness history 
forever. 
But for now, UAlbany 
will focus on the task 
at hand, which is a 
rematch with Hartford on 
Wednesday. The rest of 
the schedule is dependent 
on the results of the other 
games.
“This is a group that 
deserves to keep playing,” 
Brown said. 
If the 26-game win streak 
at SEFCU Arena is any 
indication, UAlbany has 
to like its chances of doing 
just that.

DANES WIN SENIOR SENDOFF

BASKETBALL

By TROY FARKAS

On a night the University at 
Albany honored the four seniors 
on its men’s basketball team in 
their last regular-season home 
game, Peter Hooley turned in 
one of his poorest shooting 
performances of the season.
But basketball is a team sport, 
and Hooley’s teammates picked up 
the slack in a 75-59 victory versus 
Hartford on Saturday night in front 
of a crowd of 4,408 people.
Hooley finished with five 
points, shooting just one of 10 
from the field, adding three free 
throws. 
“Evan [Singletary] and Ray 
[Sanders] don’t think too much. 
They just go out and play,” said 
UAlbany head coach Will Brown. 
“Peter is a heavy thinker. It was 
a lot for him today,” said Brown, 
referring to the emotions Hooley 
must have felt walking alongside 
several members of his family who 
flew from Australia to walk out 
with him on the court in the pre-
game ceremony.
Co-seniors Singletary and 
Sanders—who are playing in just 
their second seasons for the Great 
Danes—scored 19 and 16 points, 
respectively, in a win that extended 
the Danes’ home winning streak to 
26 games, dating all the way back 
to a loss in December 2014.
But perhaps most encouraging 
for UAlbany, which holds 
the No. 2 seed in the America 
East tournament that begins 
Wednesday, is the recent play of 
sophomore forward Greig Stire. 
He finished with a career-high 18 
points and added 10 rebounds, one 
game after posting a 16 point, 15 

rebound performance at UMass-
Lowell.
“He’s got a ton of confidence 
down there right now,” Brown 
said. “He’s got to be [America 
East] Player of the Week. He’s had 
two monster double-doubles.”
“He’s a man among boys right 
now,” Sanders said.
UAlbany came out to a slow 
start, leading the Hawks 33-29 
after the first half. With the Danes 
leading 46-40 with 13:43 left, Stire 
imposed his will on the Hawks, 
who fall to 8-22 on the season.
Stire scored UAlbany’s next 
seven points, using all of his 6’7” 
frame to bully defenders in the 
low post, pushing the lead to 10 
points in the process. UAlbany 
never looked back after that point 
despite the efforts from Hartford’s 
Pancake Thomas, who poured 
in a game-high 23 points for the 
Hawks.
“I’m proud of our team and how 
we fought and how we competed,” 
said head coach John Gallagher. 
“There is a reason they’re 23-7.”
Gallagher’s team will get a 
chance to redeem themselves on 
Wednesday  . They will come back 
to SEFCU Arena to play UAlbany 
again in the quarterfinals of the 
America East tournament. The 
Hawks hold the No. 7 seed.
Every sports fan knows it’s 
tough to beat a team three times in 
a season, which is why Gallagher 
knows his team can come to 
Albany again and give the Great 
Danes a run for their money.
“We’re gonna be a loose group 
on Wednesday night—the pressure 
isn’t on us,” Gallagher said. “We 
will be the more excited team.”
Brown doesn’t foresee either 

team changing its game plan. He 
says he knows what his team has 
to do to win, but recognizes it is 
playoff basketball now, which 
offers a whole different beast than 
the regular season.

“The regular season is over 
with. It’s survive and advance,” 
Brown said.
For a low-major conference like 
the America East, only the winner 
of the conference tournament will 

qualify for the NCAA tournament. 
UAlbany has won the last three 
America East tournaments, despite 
only winning the regular season in

 The University at Albany men’s 
lacrosse team bounced back after a 
disappointing 7-16 loss to Syracuse the 
previous weekend. Sophomore attack Seth 
Oakes scored a career-high tie with six 
goals. 
With a seven goal difference, the game 
was far from dominated by the Great 
Danes. The first half was consistently back 
and forth play, with both teams scoring 
often and playing fast lacrosse. Coach Marr 
said at halftime they had to make defensive 
adjustments.
“Defensively, we tightened up at 
halftime,” Marr said. “We only gave up 

five goals in the second half.” 
John Fallon Field lit up in the fourth 
quarter where everyone knew UAlbany 
lacrosse was present. The team outscored 
Drexel 7-1, and secured the win with 
selfless play and strict, organized defense. 
Senior midfielder John Maloney said he 
thinks the team is still working out certain 
kinks, however believes in his team and 
what they can do this season.
“I think we’re all just working together 
still trying to find our groove, but I like 
what we did offensively,” Maloney said.
Maloney had three goals against Drexel 
and overall 11 different UAlbany players 
scored. 
The UAlbany men’s team will play next 
at home Saturday March 5 against Cornell.

The 2016 women’s lacrosse campaign 
got off to a shaky start for No. 19 
University at Albany women’s lacrosse  as 
they fell 9-5 to Cornell. This loss was the 
team’s first home loss in over two years. 
The Great Danes struck 
first when sophomore attack 
Alie Jimerson scored 1:56 into 
the contest, but fell behind 
and trailed 4-2 at halftime. 
After last years points leader 
Dakotah Savitcheff scored with 
7:46 on the clock, that gave 
Albany a 2-1 lead, Cornell 
would respond with three 
consecutive goals to end the 
period. 
With momentum on their 
side, The Big Red came out 
firing to begin the second 
half, adding three more goals 
in less than four minutes and 
taking a commanding 7-2 
lead. UAlbany would not 
go down without a fight and 
showed signs of life following 
Cornell’s flurry. 
Junior Midfield Emily Mizer 
responded with her wheels 
and scored after taking it the 
distance. Veteran attack Julie 
Cryderman also tallied back to 
back goals narrowing Cornell’s 
deficit to 7-5 with 15:21 left to 
play. Cryderman had a career 
high two goals in the home 
opener.
But, with costly turnovers 
and penalties the Great 
Danes weren’t able to make a 
comeback.
Four crucial cough-ups gave 
Cornell multiple opportunities 
to put the game on ice and they 
did so with 1:57 left. They 
added a second nail in the 

coffin with less than 30 seconds remaining 
and UAlbany lost 9-5. 
The women’s team looks to improve on 
the road in North Carolina where they face 
Elon Friday, March 4 and North Carolina 
Sunday, March 6. tournament.
