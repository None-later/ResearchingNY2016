Telling genuine human 
stories and being competent 
in writing are two tips Univer-
sity at Albany alumnus and 
Esquire writer-at-large Tom 
Junod gave to today’s hopeful 
journalists when he revisited 
the campus on Sept. 10.
“The most precious thing 
is their story,” said Junod, 
who graduated in 1980 with a 
bachelor’s degree in English. 
“People entrust you with their 
stories and it’s the journalist’s 
job to handle them carefully.”
Another piece of advice 
Junod gave was that journalists 
need to learn “to write more, 
write faster and spread news 
immediately,” because we live 
in an increasingly technologi-
cal world with instant-publish-
ing machines like iPhones, 
Twitter and 
the Internet.
“Journal-
ism’s chang-
ing with the 
Internet,” he 
said. “Get-
ting news 
uploaded 
online has 
gotten 
faster…[but it’s] rarely edited. 
The editor-writer relationship 
has [also] changed. Being a 
reporter is practically a 24/7 
job now.”
Junod has been nominated 
for an all-time record of 11 Na-
tional Magazine Awards, win-
ning twice. Sponsored by the 
American Society of Magazine 
Editors, they are considered 
the most prestigious award in 
magazine journalism, similar 
to the Pulitzer Prize, and serve 
to recognize outstanding pieces 
of magazine writing. 
Junod held a seminar that 
spanned an hour at the Standish 
Room in the Science Library at 
4:15 p.m on Sept. 10th where 
he spoke about his experiences 
as a senior at UAlbany, his life 
post-graduation, and how he 
has gone on to write articles 
for numerous publications like 
GQ, Life, Sports Illustrated and 
Atlanta Magazine. 
The seminar was received 
with a packed room and the 
audience—particularly cur-
rent UAlbany students who 
hope to pursue journalism as

There are few places in the 
world more dangerous to be 
a journalist than the former 
Soviet Union. Opposition 
media outlets are frequently 
targeted and shut down by 
security forces, journalists are 
routinely imprisoned without 
trial, and there has been an 
alarming upsurge of violence 
against journalists.
Two journalists, Iryna 
Kyporenko of Ukraine 
and Ulviyya Akhundova 
of Azerbaijan, visited the 

University at Albany last week 
as part of a program called 
The Digital Communication 
Network, which is run by the 
State Department and carried 
out through the International 
Center of the Capital Region.
Their personal stories about 
reporting from conflict zones 
and inside repressive regimes 
are harrowing.
Kyporenko, a tall, 26-year-
old woman from the Black Sea 
port of Odessa, is a freelance 
multimedia reporter who has 
been covering the unrest in 
her country since the winter of 

2014. When clashes broke out 
in Odessa in May 2014 between 
supporters of the ousted 
Moscow-backed President 
Viktor Yankukovich and 
supporters of the newly-formed 
pro-European government, 
Kyporenko took to the streets 
and began shooting film.
The chaos and vehemence 
of the protestors are readily 
apparent in the video posted 
to the website and YouTube 
page of hromadske.tv, the 
independent outlet for which

One minute tall trees fill 
the courtyard area by the 
Science Library, and the 
next minute stumps and dirt 
take their place. 
Or at least that’s how it 
felt. But nothing is taken 
down (or put up) without 
planning or prior consider-
ation. 
The University at Al-
bany created a “landscape 
masterplan” around 2007, 
according to Mary Ellen 
Mallia, director of the Of-
fice of Environmental Sus-
tainability. UAlbany hired 
Trowbridge Consultants 
to take an inventory of the 
trees on campus and look at 
their condition. 
What they found wasn’t 
good. There were three 
kinds of trees on campus 
before 2008: Austrian Pine, 
Pin Oak, and Honey Locust. 
However, the vast majority 
of the trees were Austrian 
Pines, forming a monocul-
ture of trees around campus. 
From a biodiversity stand-
point, monocultures aren’t a 
good thing, Mallia said. 
One reason is when one 
tree gets sick, that sickness 
can spread to the rest of the 
trees of the same species. 
And the Pines got sick with 
a condition called diplodia, 
a kind of anamorphic fungi 
which makes the branches a 
brownish color. 
The diplodia spread to 
more than 75 percent of 
the Austrian Pines. Most 
of the infected trees will 
die within five or 10 years, 
Mallia said. 
While some trees are 
taken down because they 
are sick, most are chopped 
as a “consequence of ex-
pansion,” Mallia said. But 
because of the widespread

It started as 
SUNYPartyStories, then 
became USAPartyStories, 
and now it’s College 
Weekly. 
Despite the multiple 
brand changes, the Twitter 
account known for its week-
ly party picture competi-
tions has more than 101,000 
followers on Twitter and is 

spreading out to other areas 
of social media, including 
YouTube, Facebook, and 
Snapchat. It’s really popular 
amongst college students 
across the nation -- at least, 
that’s what the owners say.
The party picture com-
petitions will be continu-
ing, according to Curtis 
Michael, a co-founder of 
College Weekly. 
The main idea of the 

submission contest is going 
to be nearly the same as it 
has been the last two years 
-- students can submit pic-
tures or videos via twitter 
or email and the one that 
gets the most retweets on 
Twitter will win that week. 
However, Michael says a 
few things will change. 
“We are looking to grow 
our number of video sub-
missions and less of photo 

submissions,” he said. 
This year, weekly win-
ners will receive a College 
Weekly Swag Bag, which 
includes things such as ping 
pong balls, stickers, hats, 
pens, and lighters. 
Michael added that the 
organization may be adding 
to the types of content that 
they endorse. 
“We are looking for 
submissions that focus on 

Greek life, bid day, parties, 
philanthropies, campuses, 
interesting people doing 
cool things, interviews, 
sports, football games, 
tailgates, et cetera,” he said. 
“Anything that is college 
related and would be of 
interest to college students, 
prospects, and alumni.”

Director aims to ‘Start-Up’ campus

By JANIE FRANK

Limewire is a thing of the 
past. Downloading audio from 
Youtube is tedious. iTunes can be 
expensive. Spotify has advertise-
ments unless you pay a monthly 
fee. 
Trebel Music, a new smart-
phone application that will be 
available to University at Albany 
students this week, could change 
that for students.
The creator of Trebel Music, 
Gary Mekikian, calls the app 
the “the first free legit download 
service.” By listening to music 
and downloading songs to a 

device through the app, users 
earn points. They can then use the 
points to listen to music without 
ads. The more songs a person le-
gally downloads, the longer they 
can listen to music uninterrupted. 
And it’s all free. 
“It’s integrated,” Mekikian 
said. “It’s in one place so you 
can play all the music on your 
device.”
Over the last year, M&M 
Media, the company that owns 
Trebel Music, has been talking to 
students at colleges and universi-
ties across the nation to see how 
they could make the app better, 
according to Chief of Product 

Corey Jones. During this time, it 
was known by a different name.
“The company M&M Media 
was started at the origin of a 
couple of millennials,” Mekikian 
said. 
Mekikians’ two daughters, 
Julie and Grace, mentioned to 
him that their friends were getting 
music from YouTube converter 
sites and torrents. 
“The idea was to create a safe 
and fun place for young people to 
download and enjoy their music, 
and do that in a way that gets the 
artists compensation at the same 
time,” Mekikian said. “It’s for 
millennials, by millennials.”

Students who use the app have 
the option of organizing their 
music by placing it in different 
playlists, which can then be given 
moods such as “study,” “work-
out,” or “chillin.” New playlists 
can be made at any time. Any 
song being played can switch 
from the regular viewing screen 
to its music video to the lyrics by 
swiping left or right. 
Because it’s millennial-made, 
the app had to have a social 
aspect.
“You can invite people to join 
in on the app so you can start

New York has increas-
ingly made the higher 
education sector a cen-
terpiece of its economic 
development strategy in 
recent years. Earlier this 
month, the University at Al-
bany hired Matt Grattan as 
director of community and 
economic development to 
help the university 
better align with 
that strategy.
The signature 
program of the 
state’s higher 
education focus in 
economic develop-
ment is Start-Up 
NY. This program 
allows companies 
to operate tax-free 
for up to 10 years 
by partnering with a 
college or univer-
sity, locating near 
them and aligning 
with their academic 
mission.
During his last 
post at Schenectady 
County Community 
College (SCCC), 
Grattan devel-
oped the college’s 
Start-Up NY plan 
and helped attract 
companies to partner 
with the college. Attracting 
more companies to part-
ner with UAlbany under 
Start-Up NY will be one of 
his top priorities in his new 
position.
“I think it’s very benefi-
cial for colleges and univer-
sities because it provides 
an excellent opportunity for 
us to build in experiential 
learning, and I know Pro-
vost Stellar is really trying 
to advance opportunities 
for internships, co-ops and 
experiential learning,” Grat-
tan said. 
UAlbany currently has 
one company in the Start-

Up NY program, a pro-
ducer of digital educational 
resources called ClassBook.
com. Grattan hopes to see 
that number grow and says 
the university has more in 
the pipeline. 
“It’s a job creator… but 
in order for that to occur, 
what’s pivotal is that we 
have the buy-in of our 
faculty and our academic 

leadership so these compa-
nies align with the academic 
mission of the university,” 
he said.
 Start-Up NY came under 
fire earlier this year when 
reports showed only 76 
jobs had been created by 
the program. Gov. Cuomo 
and others are still confident 
in the program and say it 
is too young to evaluate 
fairly. Grattan also said the 
criticisms were unfair, and 
he still believes the program 
will be successful. 
“Start-Up NY capitalizes 
on what is clearly one of 
New York state’s strengths 

when it comes to economic 
development, which is the 
concentration of higher 
education,” he said.
Another program Grattan 
will focus on to leverage 
the university for economic 
development is UAlbany’s 
designation as an innova-
tion hotspot. Funding 
was awarded to UAlbany 
through the competitive 
Regional Eco-
nomic Development 
Council process 
to work with other 
local colleges and 
community partners 
to create an incuba-
tion space for new 
companies.
Grattan said 
they are currently 
developing the gov-
ernance structure, 
work plan, and bud-
get for the program, 
and he hopes to start 
soliciting compa-
nies to move into 
space in the Massry 
Center for Business 
this spring.
A third program 
that Grattan will be 
concentrating on is 
attracting compa-
nies to be research 
partners with the 
Atmospheric Science 
College, which was recently 
awarded seed money from 
the state as a center for 
excellence.
Grattan will be applying 
his experience from SCCC 
and 19 years at the NYS 
Department of Labor, where 
he focused on workforce 
development and business 
outreach, to try and make all 
of these programs succeed 
at UAlbany.  He believes 
that doing so will benefit 
students and the surround-
ing economy. 
“Public-private partner-
ships are the wave of the 
future,” he said.

DANES SAY WHAT?

 “I like the new Campus Center but I really do 
miss the old one because of Wholly Habaneros. 
That was my favorite place. This new campus 
center was definitely worth the money though. 
The fountain grill was a great edition. They 
serve breakfast all day and I love that. Overall 
the food has became a lot better. Cusato’s now 
offers a lot more and a lot of students think it is 
magnificent.”

- Sapphire Correa, Class of 2018 

This week, we asked students: 

What do you think of the new Campus 
Center addition that recently opened?

Compiled by Vaughnee 
Simmons

“I like the campus center but it is missing 
Asian food. That is my favorite food and I just 
feel like it was essential to have because it was 
popular with students. The new extension was 
definitely worth the money and construction but 
I just feel we can add more once the Campus 
Center is complete. I really enjoy the Fountain 
Grill though. The food is really good. Otherwise, 
the Cusato’s and the deli is the same as last year 
in my opinion.”

- Amber Henry, Class of 2018

 “I think the new campus center is 
awesome. I think the layout is amazing. 
The open area is much more appealing. 
The windows let in a lot of sunlight. The 
workers are much more friendly this 
semester than previous semesters. I think 
the extension was a beautiful add-on and 
worth all the money. The food is on-
point. This is something UAlbany hasn’t 
had in the past. Now that they have the 
Fountain Grill, I’m all about it.”

- Eric Schulman, Class of 2019

Broadcaster and writer An-
drew Collins wrote in a blog for 
Franklin Center for Government 
and Public Integrity, “one need 
only look at the challenges of 
journalists in nations where de-
mocracy is either in its infancy or 
does not exist at all… from Cuba 
to Russia and extending across 
continents—journalists face the 
very real threat of death for re-
porting what those in government 
do not want reported”
Journalists are often killed for 
reporting on people with power, 
or rather people who abuse 
power. According to the Center 
to Protect Journalists (CPJ), 74 

percent of the journalists that 
have been killed since 1992 were 
reporting on politics, and over 
half of the victims’ lives were 
taken by people in political par-
ties.
Wikileaks founder Julian 
Assange, describing his vision 
for the site, said, “It is the role 
of good journalism to take on 
powerful abusers, and when pow-
erful abusers are taken on, there’s 
always a bad reaction.”
These abusers will find ways 
to silence reporters. Egypt passed 
a law this June that makes it 
illegal to report terrorist-related 
events if the report does not 

match the official state report. 
There are currently 18 journalists 
imprisoned in Egypt.
The people who threaten, im-
prison or even kill journalists do 
it to control or stop the flow of 
information. They do it because 
they know that knowledge is 
power, and a journalist’s job is 
to give people that information 
-- that power.
The current situation in Libya 
shows what happens when jour-
nalists can’t safely report. Due to 
the danger that journalists face in 
Libya, most of them avoid it and, 
as a result, we don’t get credible 
information coming out. Instead 
of relying on reports that have 
been confirmed and investigated 
by people committed to inform-
ing the public, we get conflicting 
reports from warring parties with 
their own ulterior motives.
 I would mention the direct 
results of us not getting informa-
tion, but that’s the problem -- we 
just don’t know. There is no way 
of knowing what’s happening in 
Libyan cities, such as Darna. The 

violent extremists that control 
the city could be committing any 
number of atrocities. The lack 
of credible information makes 
it harder for other countries to 
intervene, and without know-
ing what’s going on, it is nearly 
impossible to justify intervention. 
The inspiration to write this ar-
ticle came from the tragic deaths 
of two journalists in Virginia. 
Television reporter Alison Parker 
and cameraman Adam Ward, 
both of whom worked for WDBJ, 
were killed during a live report 
last month. Vicki Gardener, who 
was being interviewed, was also 
shot and released from the hospi-
tal last week. The shooter,Vester 
Lee Flanagan II, killed himself 
shortly after the attack. Flana-
gan was a former employee of 
the station he attacked and had 
worked with both of the journal-
ists he killed. He was fired from 
the station in 2013.
Because of this tragedy, 
discussions about the dangers 
that journalists face in their work 
have emerged.

When I said that journalists 
doing a good job are probably in 
danger, I was making a statement 
about how the world is, not how 
it should be. In a perfect world, 
journalists would be protected. 
It would be safe for them to go 
after people in power because 
they know that the public and the 
government will protect them.
Hopefully the tragedy in 
Virginia will make people fight 
to keep journalists safe and will 
help to bring our attention to the 
great risks that journalists face. 
Hopefully it will lead to us pro-
tecting journalists, because if we 
don’t protect them, they won’t be 
able to protect us.
The CPJ is leading the fight 
to make it safer for journalists to 
do their jobs. On their website, 
they call on people to support 
the #RightToReport and ask that 
people sign a petition that calls 
on the Obama administration to 
take steps to protect journalists. 
To sign the petition go to 
www.CPJ.org and look under the 
“Advocacy & Action” tab.

I

f a journalist finds himself or herself in danger, 
it means what they are reporting is important. It 
also means that somebody with power will do 
almost anything to keep the information they are 
reporting a secret, which is exactly the type of infor-
mation that needs to get out.

P

aying for college is one of the 
most difficult things Americans 
are faced with. However, in a mar-
ket ever reliant upon education, it 
is a burden many are forced to bear. 
Let’s have an honest conversation about 
fully funded (as in completely free) college 
education. More than just being a popular 
point of rhetoric for liberal political candi-
dates, free higher education is simply good 
policy, as it’s both a societal benefit and an 
economic one. 
Let’s consider some historical context.  
It is no coincidence that the United States is 
becoming the world’s predominant power 
not long after it instituted guaranteed, free 
public education. Having an educated 
work force made us a more productive and 
competitive society. This policy reaped 
untold benefits for the United States over 
the course of the following half-century. 
However, in the past 30 years alone we 
have seen massive transitions in Europe 
towards highly subsidized, if not entirely 
free higher education. This gives Europe 
an economic edge as the Western world 
transitions away from blue- collar work 
into more specialized labor. 
In order to remain competitive globally, 
it is critical that we keep pace with the 
rest of the world. If we want to have any 
hope of continuing to be the world’s larg-
est economy, free higher education is an 
absolute must. 
Here is another consideration: student loan 
debt is the largest category of debt in the 
United States, exceeding more than $1.2 
trillion dollars. Even if someone files for 
bankruptcy, student debt will stick. If that 
wasn’t bad enough, interest rates on student 
loans are egregiously higher than those 
given to law-breaking banking institutions 
during the 2008 bailout. Some are more 
than 800 percent higher. 
Student debt tends to stick with its debtor 
for a great deal of their early adult life, 
often impeding many young adults from 
purchasing new cars or homes. As a basic 
economic rule, massive amounts of debt 
are an inherently negative economic force. 
It hinders young people from spending 
money, which in turn hinders the market 
and job creation. 
Free higher education immediately allevi-
ates this problem, ensuring that no family 
and no student would ever have to worry 
about saddling themselves with massive 

amounts of debt in order to have a fighting 
chance in the workplace. 
Many detractors of the idea cite a high cost 
as the primary argument against it. Howev-
er, providing free higher education is more 
affordable than one might think. In fact, it 
would cost the federal government roughly 
$30 billion dollars per year. Let’s consider 
a few facts here. The SUNY system creates 
$5 in economic activity for every $1 of 
state money allocated to it. Universities are 
economic drivers that  make investments 
in local and state economies. Additionally, 
$30 billion dollars is manageable when 
considering that overall federal outlays in 
2014 were upwards of $3.5 trillion. If the 
United States were to eliminate mandatory 
minimums for non-violent low-level drug 
offenses (the sale of marijuana), we would 
save around $80 billion per year alone. 
In short, free higher education is a matter 
of social justice in addition to being a smart 
economic policy. It is time for the United 
States to catch up with the rest of the world 
and fully fund higher education for all. 

DEBATE

By PATRICK GAREAU
W

e are more than just students. 
We are young adults and citi-
zens tasked with solving some 
pretty daunting challenges over 
the course of our lifetime. When politi-
cians think they can win our vote simply 
by promising free tuition, we should be of-
fended that they think we will just happily 
vote in our self-interest and won’t carefully 
look at the entire picture.
One of the defining factors of the entire 
picture is bleak government finances. The 
national debt is approaching $20 trillion, 
and state and local financial pictures aren’t 
any better. In this context, the creation of 
new spending programs, like tuition-free 
college, must be done judiciously, as not to 
put government financial health in contin-
ued jeopardy, which could lead to severe 
economic problems.
So, the question: is the need for tuition-
free public college (like Bernie Sanders 
wants) so pressing that it is worth using any 
budgetary wiggle room we may have?
No, it is not. Some struggling students 
are still able to receive a college degree 
with relatively low debt under the current 
aid program. Any reforms to higher educa-
tion finances should be specifically targeted 
toward the continued improvement of af-
fordability and access for students from low 
and middle income backgrounds. A free 
option for all is the wrong approach.
Over 4,000 of the 12,095 full-time 
undergraduate students at the University 
at Albany either did not apply for need-
based financial aid or were determined 
not to have financial need according to the 
university’s 2014-15 common data set. If 
students with no financial need were able 
to attend tuition-free, that revenue hole for 
the university would have to be closed with 
public money.
In general, a good practice for citizens 
is to be cautious about asking the public to 
pay more in taxes. Any taxing and govern-
ment spending should be devoted to firm 
public goods without individual beneficia-
ries that could reasonably take on a portion 
of the cost. Education is a public good, and 
this is why it is a good idea to subsidize 
public colleges with tax money as we cur-
rently do. Increasing that subsidization to 
some extent isn’t a bad idea either.
But, there is also a significant benefit 
that each individual student derives from 
attending college. This is why it is com-

pletely reasonable to ask students to bear 
a percentage of the cost. At current tuition 
levels, getting a college degree is still a 
great investment even when taking on debt. 
Getting an average lifetime income boost of 
$1 million for incurring $25-30,000 in debt 
should not be a cause for complaint.
If we want to be serious about solv-
ing educational inequality problems, the 
severity is much worse for younger age 
groups. A better use of the limited budget-
ary wiggle room we have is to increase 
resources to primary education and make 
access to preschool universal. Even in 
higher education there are better uses for 
increased resources, like developing better 
online learning platforms and maintaining 
old facilities. Cutting costs and curbing the 
exponentially increasing price of educating 
a student also has to be addressed, which 
doesn’t draw much attention in the conver-
sation for tuition-free college.
Needless to say, non-educational needs 
for the country, like increased funding for 
infrastructure, research and development, 
improving the healthcare system, invest-
ment in clean energies, national security, 
etc.
We cannot afford to have the govern-
ment provide every service imaginable, 
nor should we be eager to ask our fel-
low citizens for more money to spend on 
something that we get major benefits from. 
Issues of the day are always more compli-
cated than simply asking “does this benefit 
me?” We have to be asking what is good 
for the country, what kind of responsibility 
we each can take on, what the unforeseen 
consequences might be and what the alter-
natives are.
As current college students, it may sound 
right that taking on debt for education is 
unfair, and it may be easy to point to other 
countries around the world that do it. As 
citizens who take an informed and nu-
anced look at what we can and should do, 
a tuition-free college plan is less likely to 
make the cut as a priority.

Should higher education be free?

EDITOR: JULIA DAY 
ARTSENT.ASP@GMAIL.COM

The massive following refers 
to themselves as the “Zamily” and 
they know how to cause a scene 
via tailgating, which included the 
game of cornhole, red solo cups 
and blasting songs by the band 
they would see live in the hours to 
come. 
The reason I ended up at the 
concert was because the night 
before I was approached by a 
couple of friends I hadn’t seen 
since the spring. They said I 
should come along to the concert 
because “I love music… I would 
love the concert,” among other 
random arguments. 
I ended up not paying for my 
ticket, the only stipulation being 
I would have to buy my own 

food and drinks, and I reluctantly 
agreed. Little did I know the expe-
rience I’d be in for. 
Our troupe arrived at SPAC 
roughly around 2 p.m. The gates 
to the venue opened at 5 p.m., 
leaving us plenty of time to 
pregame, mingle and get inside 
to preserve our own spot on the 
lawn. As soon as we arrived in 
the main parking lot and linked 
up with people my friends knew, I 
realized I was in for a treat. 
The next five hours consisted 
of agonizing heat, warm beer, 
strangely pristine lifted pickup 
trucks, camouflage, men in tank 
tops, and Zac Brown Band music 
being blared from every “Zamily” 
group present in the parking lot.

We finally decided to meander 
into the venue around 7 p.m. 
amidst the massive migration 
of other patrons who had the 
same idea. I had no clue who the 
opening band was, and I don’t 
think anyone in my group really 
cared. 
After paying $11 for a beer, 
we worked our way to the lawn, 
which was occupied by various 
camping chairs, blankets, and 
belligerent fans. Not long after 
we found a small plot of grass 
to hunker down on, Zac Brown 
and his band took the stage 
and broke into his latest single 
“Homegrown,” followed by the 
feel-good summer hit of 2010, 
“Knee Deep,” which invoked 
massive crowd response. Fan-
favorites “Keep Me In Mind” and 
“Castaway” were performed with 
eerie precision, sounding exactly 
like the studio versions of the 
songs. Their first set also saw a 
rendition of The Marshall Tucker 
Band’s hit “Can’t See You,” 
which turned into a roughly 10 
minute jam between the members 
of the band. 
After a brief intermission, 
Zac Brown swooped back onto 

the stage and dazzled the now 
well-sauced crowd with hits like 
“Loving You Easy,” “Tomorrow 
Never Comes,” and ended their 
second set with yet another Jimmy 
Buffet-esque anthem, “Toes.” This 
happened after Zac Brown broke 
into cover versions of Queen’s hit 
“Bohemian Rhapsody” (which 
even had me singing along) and 
the Bruno Mars, Police-sounding 
single “Locked Out of Heaven.” 
The band even did a rendition 
of “Heavy is the Head,” which 
is a single off their latest album 
“Jekyll + Hyde” featuring Sound-
garden’s Chris Cordell. The track 
reeked of that Seattle sound that 
so well defined 90s rock music, 
and was performed very well 
by the band, and easily one of 
the only decent songs I heard all 
evening. 
After being called out onto 
stage for an encore by a tire-
less crowd, the band ran through 
another single “Beautiful Drug” 
off their new record, and closed 
out the night with the fan favorite 
“Chicken Fried,” which saw the 
entire audience singing along 
in drunken unison. At one point 
during the track, I turned around 

and scanned my immediate sur-
roundings and was pleased to 
see everyone captivated by the 
performance, dancing and singing 
along with Zac Brown and his 
band. Even though I was harassed 
multiple times for trampling on 
blankets, I could still appreciate 
the musicality behind the Zac 
Brown Band. 
As I trudged across the narrow 
bridge on my way to the parking 
lot at the close of the show, I came 
to the same conclusion about mod-
ern country music as I’d always 
had: I don’t like the fans associ-
ated with the scene and I don’t 
enjoy the music or the messages 
that are spouted off in the songs 
those bands perform. 
However, I’ve been playing 
music over the past decade, and 
I have been to numerous clubs, 
festivals and shows, seeing just 
about every genre of music in a 
live setting. I can appreciate just 
how talented these musicians are. 
If you’re a fan of modern 
country music, see the Zac Brown 
Band as soon as humanly possible. 
If you can make it past the rabid, 
rowdy fans you will indeed have a 
fantastic experience. 

L

et me set the record straight: I don’t particularly 
care for modern country music. I’m not sure if 
it’s the musicality behind it, or the sweaty and 
obnoxious younger fans, but I’ve never been 
impressed with anything about this movement. 
However, on Sunday Sept. 6, I found myself half-
dehydrated, overtired and completely overwhelmed in 
the midst of hordes of partially (and sometimes fully) 
intoxicated Zac Brown Band fans that had gathered at the 
Saratoga Performing Arts Center. 

CONCERTS

Zac Brown Band invades SPAC

By REECE WILLIAMS

It was no coincidence that 
Healthy on Lark opened on Friday 
June 12, the same weekend as the 
Capital Region’s Pride Parade and 
subsequent festival.
“Everybody is welcome,” says 
first-time restaurant owner Sharon 
Lastique. “I’m really working to-
wards establishing a super friendly 
vibe that’s also non-judgmental.”
Less than two weeks prior, Lil’ 
Buddha Tea Company and Vegan 
Café still held residence in the 
sub-600 square foot basement-
style store front at 274 Lark St. 
But on May 30, after deciding 
to pursue a career in education, 
owner Shannon Feeney closed one 
of the Capital Region’s few (if not 
only) 100 percent vegan establish-
ments.
Feeney originally approached 
Mike Sperduto, owner of Lark 
Street’s Ben & Jerry’s, about tak-
ing over the space, but soon after 
entered into negations with Last-
ique by Sperduto’s advisement. 
Lastique, a native of Queens, 
N.Y., became a vegetarian when 
she was 15, after reading “Diet for 
a Small Planet” by Francis Moore 
Lappé. The book documents 
the undesirable effects the meat 
production industry has on the 
environment and individual health. 
“That really set me on a path 
to becoming conscious of what I 

put into my body,” says Lastique. 
“When I was exposed to the truth 
about how animals were raised 
in this country, I decided I didn’t 
want to be a part of that.”
Lastique’s decision to abstain 
from most animal products was 
not well-received by her parents. 
“I grew up in a very cultural 
home; my father from Trinidad, 
and my mom Romania,” she says. 
“My mother told me [then] that I 
needed to learn how to cook.”
After graduating from Brandeis 
University with a bachelor’s 
degree in sociology, women’s 
studies and legal studies in 1995, 
Lastique went on to earn a mas-
ter’s degree in criminal justice 
from John Jay College. For the 
next 13 years, she worked as a 
project manager at the New York 
State Office of Court Administra-
tion. 
In 2011, Lastique enrolled 
in and completed the Certified 
Health Coaching curriculum 
through the Integrative Nutrition 
Program. Soon after, she joined 
The Quest for Optimum Health, a 
web-based healthy-living initiative 
established in Albany. 
Lastique targets “corporate 
women who want more energy,” 
offering weight-loss challenges, 
movement classes, and cooking 
classes. She also teaches yoga, nu-
trition, and discusses their shared 
relation to sociology through her 

“Healthy is the New Sexy,” pro-
gram, which encourages students 
to “take charge of their health.” 
She hopes to bring the class to the 
University at Albany in the com-
ing semesters.
But owning a restaurant had 
long been in Lastique’s plans. 
“Since I was young, I always had 
a vision—a fantasy—of having 
a café or a restaurant,” she says. 
Being approached by Feeney “was 
a very interesting moment that the 
universe said, ‘Well, here’s your 
opportunity; are you willing to 
take it, or not?’”
Healthy on Lark features a 
mostly plant-based menu, the two 
lone animal products being the 
free range eggs and assortment of 
goat and cow cheeses (both the 
eggs and the cheeses are locally-
sourced). 
“I will not consume eggs 
without knowing where they’re 
from,” says Lastique. “I need to 
know that they’re happy eggs from 
happy chickens.”
“In this country it often means 
hamburgers and mac and cheese, 
and fried food,” says Lastique. “I 
want to flip the script, and ask, 
‘How can we comfort ourselves 
with delicious food that’re going 
to make us feel good afterwards?”
But make no mistake—Lastique 
does not sacrifice flavor for health 
with her menu. The food must 
“make your taste buds sing,” she 

says. “If it 
doesn’t float 
my boat, I’m 
not serving 
it. That’s 
the bottom 
line.”
Break-
fast bur-
ritos bulge, 
stuffed with 
vitamins and 
additional 
protein 
from sweet 
potatoes and 
mushrooms.    
“Super-
foods are of-
ten an afterthought for people, but 
here, they’re the primary focus,” 
says Lastique. The most popular 
plates have been the Chickpea 
Burger ($8.50), and the Vegan 
B.L.T. ($7.50). 
Kennedy Johnson, 16, decided 
that she wanted to help out around 
the restaurant after she and a 
friend wandered in to what they 
remembered was Lil’ Buddha. 
“Sharon overheard us reading 
the menu and invited us in,” says 
Johnson. “I came back later that 
day and said, ‘I’d love to help if 
you ever need any.’”
On Sept. 19, Healthy on Lark 
promoted a limited menu featuring 
fresh juices for passersby, taking 
part in the area’s popular neigh-

borhood celebration, LarkFest. 
Sept. 20 was the restaurant’s first 
spoken word brunch, featuring 
local documentary filmmaker 
and farm-to-table advocate Imani 
Peterkin. 
Healthy on Lark is open Mon-
day and Friday 11 a.m.-7 p.m.; 
Tuesday through Thursday 10 
am.-5pm.; Saturday 12pm.-6pm.; 
and on select Sundays for brunch.
“What I want? It’s not too much 
to ask,” says Lastique. “Just a 
global shift in consciousness to be 
more kind to all sentient beings. 
People eat at least three times a 
day. So, the opportunity to get 
people to shift [their thinking] is 
during those times when they’re 
picking up a fork or a spoon, or a 
cup.”

FROM THE COVER8

TUESDAY, SEPTEMBER 22, 2015
ALBANY STUDENT PRESS

EDITOR: JANIE FRANK 
THEASPNEWS@GMAIL.COM

Junod candidly reflected on 
his journey leading up to be-
ing a journalist for Esquire. 
“[Junod’s] unafraid as a re-
porter and he’s eager to learn 
stories and tell them to a wide 
audience,” said Mark Koplik, 
Program Fellow of the New 
York State Writers Institute 
which coordinated Junod’s 
visit. “He writes maniacally 
and revises savagely…[and] 
is one of the finest American 
essayists.”
Junod’s writing has often 
dealt with themes of power 
and vulnerability. One of his 
unpublished works describes 
a real-life experience of be-
ing held at gunpoint while 
working as a salesman. The 
experience shook and inspired 
him to write about it from 
a personal and vulnerable 
perspective. 
Since then, Junod has been 
particularly remembered for 
his 2003 article, “The Falling 
Man,” where he discussed 
the controversial image that 
Associated Press photogra-
pher Robert Drew took of an 

unidentified man who leaped 
from the burning North Tower 
of the doomed World Trade 
Center on Sept. 11, 2001. 
Despite some objections from 
the public, the article has since 
circulated nationwide and 
Junod even read it aloud on 
Sept. 11, 2015—the day after 
visiting UAlbany—in honor 
of the attacks’ 14th anniversa-
ry at the Huxley Theatre in the 
New York State Museum.
Junod is no stranger to 
covering subjects that are 
eccentric and unconventional, 
such as when he profiled a 
jailed serial rapist, Mitchell 
Gaff, in 1995 for an article 
called “The Rapist Says He’s 
Sorry”. He also wrote “The 
Abortionist” in 1994 which 
discussed the life of an abor-
tion provider. Both of these 
were GQ articles for which he 
received a National Magazine 
Award. 
During the seminar, Junod 
found it ironic that despite 
how far he has come, he had 
taken only one journalism 
course in his senior year after 
transferring to UAlbany from 
SUNY Oneonta (the reason 
behind his transfer was to fol-
low his then-girlfriend, Janet, 
who has since become his 

wife). He explained in a Sept. 
9 interview with the Albany 
Times Union that he “went for 
love” and did not have a set 
career path at the time.
He also spoke about how as 
a senior he became invested 
in the craft of writing after 
taking courses that focused on 
intensive writing and history 
which further exposed him to 
literature. After graduating, he 
could not find any journalism-
related employment and be-
came a salesman. By the time 
he began writing for famous 
publications like Esquire and 
GQ, he was able to profile 
numerous celebrities like 
Matt Damon, George Cloo-
ney, Brad Pitt and Leonardo 
DiCaprio. 
Junod’s return to UAl-
bany for the free seminar on 
magazine journalism was 
coordinated by the New York 
State Writers Institute and 
cosponsored by UAlbany and 
the New York State Museum. 
Junod’s visit was the first of 
the Writers Institute’s Fall 
2015 Visiting Writers Series 
in which successful writers 
or filmmakers visit UAlbany 
to showcase and discuss their 
work to students and the gen-
eral public.

   been based entirely off of pictures 
and the occasional video of drunk 
people, parties, or people making bad 
decisions. According to Michael, the 
company is going on a tour during the 
Fall 2015 semester to 14 schools in the 
South in order to focus on developing 
College Weekly’s video submissions 
and increasing original content. 
    Original content from the last two 
years - when the page was still called 
SUNYPartyStories - included stu-
dents jumping off roofs, climbing into 
washing machines, and lying naked on 
floors, sometimes with FECAL MAT-
TER nearby. 
    The name change occurred earlier 
this year after rumors that the SUNY 
System had threatened to sue the SUN-
YPartyStories Twitter. 
In an interview from last September 
with The Spectrum, the University at 
Buffalo’s student paper, the then-
owner of SUNYPartyStories, who 
preferred to stay anonymous, stated 
that the SUNY System was giving him 
a hard time about the Twitter. 
“I know my rights, they can’t do any-
thing,” he said at the time. 
    SUNY has not responded to any 
requests for comment on this issue. 
    Now, Michael says the reason be-

entirely. 
    “We changed the name because our 
new company is College Weekly,” he 
said. 
    Michael would not explain why a 
new company was involved.
    “We prefer not to discuss the 
changed name because it is irrelevant,” 
he said instead. 
    College Weekly boasts more than 
100,000 followers on twitter, even 
though over a year ago they had only 
66,000. 
    Michael says he hopes College 
Weekly will give students the op-
portunity to show off their school and 
community. 
“[College Weekly] focuses on creat-
ing experiences for the college-level 
student to the largest socially driven 
online community,” he said. 
    Although Michael said the first 
competition was supposed to occur 
Sunday, Sept. 13, it never did. Michael 
has not responded to any questions as 
to why the anticipated start date has 
been delayed. 

The company’s website is College-
Weekly.com, but at this point the web-
site only acts as a way to sign up for 
emails from the organization, link to 
other social media, and submit pictures 
or videos for the competitions. College 
Weekly can be found on Twitter at @

Users can also view the most 
downloaded and most played songs 
on their campus. Other students us-
ing the app can be searched and fol-
lowed. Profiles and playlists have the 
option of being public or private.
“You can create a playlist and 
make them available for people to 
download,” Mekikian said. 
Mekikian explained that by shar-
ing music, other students will able 
to hear music they would not have 
found on their own.
“That’s the way for us to bring 
social music discovery to college 
campuses,” he said. 
If one student has been download-
ing a lot of music through Trebel 
Music and find himself or herself 
with an abundance of points, they are 
able to send those points to friends. 
Mekikian compared the point-sharing 
system to Venmo. 
“This is virtual currency,” he said. 
“It’s not real money, but people can 
share it as they’re using the applica-
tion.”
The application initially has an 
acid yellow and black color theme 
but this can be changed easily. By 

clicking on any album, that album’s 
color scheme will appear. Once the 
user finds album art with a color 
scheme he or she likes, he or she 
can shake the phone and the color 
scheme will be applied. Users can go 
back to the yellow and black theme 
at any time by resetting their settings.
Trebel Music also allows users 
to listen to music on or offline after 
they have downloaded songs.  
UAlbany was chosen as one of the 
first colleges where this app will be 
available. 
“We will be focusing a lot of our 
marketing on building an engaged 
community of users there,” Jones 
said. “Building user bases centered 
around universities where music con-
sumption is highest is important.”
Jones explained that M&M Music 
will be spending the first half of the 
school year partnering with different 
groups, such as greek organizations, 
local businesses, and student ambas-
sadors in order to raise awareness for 
Trebel Music.

Junod talked about his many exploits as a journalist, from drinking beers in Germany with 
Matt Damon, to accidentally “outing” Kevin Spacey in an article. 

diplodia, 
those trees 
were most 
likely sick, 
too.
Moving forward, the university has a 10-
year facility master plan, so the landscapers 
and planners try to plant where expansion 
won’t happen. 
“But there’s also an uncertainty,” Mallia 
said. Plans can change, and there are many 
more than 10 years ahead for UAlbany. 
This is why the university has always 
been hesitant about planting memorial 
trees, she said. 
Campus Planner Jason Kersch said the 
pressure to preserve UAlbany’s original 
design aesthetic was also something kept in 
mind, but ultimately discarded. 
UAlbany was designed by one person, 
Edward Durell Stone, who used the idea of 
a monoculture to plan the landscape. Now, 
Kersch said, they are moving away from 
treating every space the same. 
While Mallia admits that seeing trees 
disappear is “very jarring,” especially from 
an environmental standpoint, she said the 
goal of the university is to try to minimize 
the environmental impact by looking for 
ways to reuse the trees, through replanting 
or turning them into woodchips. 

“In some cases, there may be an envi-
ronmental impact that’s not desirable,” she 
said. “It’s a trade-off with construction.” 
Older trees can sequest more carbon than 
younger trees, meaning they can store more 
Carbon Dioxide long-term, which helps in 
the fight against global warming. However, 
there aren’t enough trees around campus to 
make a huge impact on the carbon footprint 
overall, Mallia said. And, on the other hand, 
biodiversity is increasing.
“It’s a much healthier ecosystem than 
five years ago,” she said. 
As for the area by the Science Library, 
trees will be planted there once again. Cer-
tain architectural changes will be made as 
part of the Campus Center project, Kersch 
said. More comfortable seating will be put 
in, and the fountain will be renovated. Eight 
Ornamental Pear trees and 10 Serviceberry 
trees will take the place of the eight Honey 
Locusts that were taken out. 
Ideally, Kersch said, they want to plant 
trees for every one taken out. Last fall at the 
Downtown Campus, about five trees were 
taken down, and 12 more were planted in 
their place in the spring. 
“We say, we know that building’s going 
up, so how do we do that in the most envi-
ronmentally sustainable way?” Mallia said.

A tree was being removed in Dutch Quad this past week. These are before-and-after shots 
of the chop. 

Kyporenko works.
“I saw a man die right next to me,” 
Kyporenko recalls.
Though Ukraine, particularly 
eastern Ukraine, is a source of 
regional unrest, it is more hospitable 
to journalists than Azerbaijan, the 
home of Akundova, 29. Azerbaijan 
ranks 162nd out of 180 countries 
in press freedom, according to the 
2015 survey by Reporters Without 
Borders.
Akundova used to report for 
the Washington-backed Radio 
Free Europe (RFE), a media outlet 
founded during the Cold War to 
broadcast uncensored news to 
audiences behind the Iron Curtain. 
Akhundova was kept in solitary 
confinement for four days after 
Azerbaijani security forces raided 
and shut down the RFE offices in the 
capital, Baku.
“They would not let me sleep 
or eat, and it was always the same 
questions – over and over – ‘who are 
you working for?’” Akundova said.
Responding to a question about 
press freedom in Azerbaijan posed by 
a student in an advanced journalism 
class, Akundova wearily responded: 
“We have no problems with 
democracy and human rights in our 
country because we have no human 
rights or democracy at all.”
With her job at RFE now non-
existent, Akundova spends a great 
deal of her time agitating for the 
release of a prominent Azerbaijani 

journalist, Khadija Ismailova. 
Ismailova was a correspondent for 
RFE and had uncovered corruption at 
the highest levels of the Azerbaijani 
government. She discovered, for 
example, that the 11-year-old son of 
Azerbaijan’s authoritarian president 
Ilham Aliyev owned nine properties 
in Dubai worth nearly $50 million.
Ismailova was sentenced to 
seven and a half years in prison 
earlier this month, in a verdict 
regarded by virtually all outside 
observers as illegitimate. Akundova 
sees Ismailova as an icon and a 
journalistic hero.
Watching a video of her on 
YouTube, through tears, Akundova 
said, “She is the most beautiful 
woman I have ever seen. She was so 
strong.” She then corrected herself.
“She is so strong,” she said.
This the first time both women 
have traveled to the United States, 
and they will be seeing Washington, 
D.C., New York City and Los 
Angeles before they return home. So 
far, most of their first impressions are 
good.
“Parts of this place [Albany] seem 
like a good place to raise your kids. 
A lot of trees and grass,” Kyporenko 
said, though Kyporenko said she was 
taken aback when, while waiting at a 
CDTA bus stop, someone tried to sell 
her marijuana.
“In my country, everybody wants 
to come to the United States and 
stay,” Akundova said. “But I tell 
them, you must build your own 
democracy around you. You must 
fight for it.”

second half to equalize the game. Leo 
Melgar, a junior, was also active in both 
halves, but saw his best opportunity in the 
62nd minute only to be saved by CCSU 
keeper, Nick Velleca. 
As the end of the second half 
approached, the Great Danes were 
dominating the possession of play. 
Pinheiro found the ball end line and beat 
his defender for a near-sided shot past 
Velleca to tie the game up, 2-2. 
“I feel like the team responded really 
well from being down twice in the game 
showing a good effort to get the result,” 
Pinheiro said.  The Great Danes just 
finished up three-game home field portion 
of the season (1-1-1) and will pack up to 
travel to Lafayette to play Tuesday. 
“We look forward to bouncing back on 
Tuesday,” Pinheiro said about the result, 

“and for our following games away from 
home. The most important thing is that 
we stick together, and then we will have 
success for sure.”
Sticking together through adversity 
seems to be a theme for the Great Danes, 
and their fans stand by them for it. Several 
injuries this season have made the team 
put a lot of responsibility in their younger 
players, and it is clear the response has 
been well all over the field. 
“Being one-third of the way through 
the season, teams are going to know 
what we do well. Central Connecticut 
State certainly jumped on us early, and 
we have to stop conceding quick goals,” 
head coach Trevor Gorman said. “I’m 
proud of our guys for fighting back from 
a deficit twice, but now we need to really 
execute to win with games coming up on 
the road.” 
The Great Danes lead the game in 
shots, 25-1 and corners 8-1 and look to 
improve their season on the road next 
week.

UAlbany’s defense was strong after allowing the first goal to the Blue Devils on 
Saturday night.

Heuser decided to stay at UAlbany. 
That decision meant that Primus 
would stay also.
“The first half-year is hard. 
You’re so far away from home. Your 
English isn’t perfect. The food is 
different, it’s the whole atmosphere,” 
Primus said.
But the transition didn’t turn out 
to be as difficult as she had thought it 
would be. 
With the help of Heuser, her new 
friend, the pair slowly adjusted 
together and learned the complexities 
of American life. Once they got more 
comfortable at school and with the 
team, the rest was history. Literally.
“You come here and you have 17 
friends. The team integrates you. 
They just help you out with whatever 
they can,” Primus said.
And it’s that kind of team 
chemistry that has made UAlbany 
into a national field hockey 

powerhouse. Primus said she loves 
how the team plays for one another 
on a daily basis. While Primus said 
she loves being a part of such a fun 
team, especially on the road trips, she 
said she and the team still have some 
unfinished business to take care of.
 “We definitely have potential to 
make it back [to the Final Four],” 
Primus said, recalling two games 
played this month. “We definitely 
kept on the same level as North 
Carolina, and we beat Maryland.”
With the Danes on the quest to 
win the America East outright and 
return to the Final Four, Sykes said 
he knows Primus has to continue 
playing at a high level for the Danes 
to reach that goal.
“It starts with your defense, 
in particular your goalie,” Sykes 
said.  “She wants to play against the 
best teams. She’s got a nice chip on 
her shoulder, and she uses it to her 
advantage. The tougher the team, the 
more she likes it.”
Even though Primus has racked up 
several awards and honors in career 
so far at UAlbany, her starting spot is 

not a lock.
Both Primus and Sykes rave about 
the skill and work ethic of freshman 
goalkeeper Melissa Nealon, a Capital 
Region product from Shenendehowa 
High School. Nealon provides 
Primus with competition every 
day and makes sure Primus isn’t 
too comfortable with her starting 
position because it could be taken 
from her at any time if Nealon 
outworks her. 
“In the past, we haven’t always 
had somebody behind her to 
challenger her,” Sykes said. “The 
backup keeps her on her toes and 
keeps her focused.”
But with that fiery attitude and 
aggressiveness that once convinced 
her German coaches to move her 
to goalie, Primus will continue to 
fight for the privilege to play for this 
team until the day she graduates. But 
before she does that, she wants to 
leave behind more of a legacy than 
she already has.
“[I want to be] the best goalkeeper 
UAlbany field hockey has had so 
far,” she said. 

In week 
three at James 
Madison, 
both Croskey 
and Ibitokun-
Hanks had strong games. In the second quarter, 
Croskey broke free for a 27-yard touchdown 
run to tie the game at 14. In the fourth quarter, 
Ibitokun-Hanks scored on a seven-yard touch-
down run. Croskey finished 102 yards rushing 
and Ibitrokun-Hanks added 75 in the 42-28 road 
loss. 
Both players should see their fair share of 
carries the rest of the season as the Great Danes 
young offense tries to win games.
“We plan on playing them both multiple 
series,” Bernard said. “Whoever gets hot, we’re 
going to ride him in the fourth quarter.” 
“I’m definitely just taking care of my op-
portunities. Once you get the opportunity to go 
in, just do what you have to do. But hey, we’re 
a family,” Ibitokun-Hanks said. “We’re all part 
of the UAlbany family. If one back does his job, 
that back does his job. You just stay behind him 
and motivate him and make sure he’s doing his 
thing.” 
UAlbany hosts Duquesne next Saturday at 3 
p.m. at Bob Ford Field.

It’s hard to replace a 
superstar. Just ask the Uni-
versity at Albany football 
team. Running back Omar 
Osbourne took a pile of 
accolades with him after 
graduating in May follow-
ing UAlbany’s 7-5 season 
in 2014.
In four years on the team, 
Osbourne finished with 
3,229 rushing yards to place 
third in the UAlbany record 
book. Twenty-nine career 
touchdowns and a first-team 
All-CAA mention make his 
act a tough one to follow. 
Now, UAlbany is relying 
on a pair of freshmen to do 
just that. 
“Omar was a special 
player and he did a lot of 
great things for us. He was a 
tremendous back,” UAlbany 
offensive coordinator Joe 
Bernard said. “We were 
fortunate in recruiting this 
year to get some quality 
backs.” 
The new running backs 
are Elliot Croskey and Eli-
jah Ibitokun-Hanks. Neither 
had carried the ball in a 
collegiate game before this 
season, but that isn’t getting 
in their way as they create 
a new path for the Great 
Danes. 
“Omar was a great 
back and just watching 
film on him, seeing what 
worked for him, and some 
of the things that he did, it 
definitely motivated me to 
want to be better,” Ibitokun-
Hanks said. “I feel as 
though he set the standards 
high, so it’s up to the next 
back to break it. That’s my 
main goal.” 
“From Omar, I learned 

patience, hard work, and 
his dedication to the game,” 
Croskey said. 
Last year, Croskey took 
a redshirt season to get 
acclimated to the UAlbany 
program. The familiarity 
with the team gave Croskey 
a lead on the competition 
for the starting job this 
summer. 
“I think just being in our 
program for a year and be-
ing a redshirt helped him,” 
Bernard said of Croskey. 
“The other guys were 
true freshmen. He’s been 

at practice, he knows the 
rigors of college football 
and that gave him an edge 
there.”
Even though Croskey 
earned the starting job in the 
offseason, it was Ibitokun-
Hanks who made a splash in 
week one. 
After Croskey struggled 
for just 32 yards on 12 car-
ries in the season opener at 
Buffalo, UAlbany brought 
Ibitokun-Hanks into the 
game for a spark. 
In his first collegiate 
game, Ibitokun-Hanks 

delivered. On just 11 car-
ries, Ibitokun Hanks ran for 
74 yards and a touchdown 
as Buffalo beat UAlbany 
51-14. Ibitokun-Hanks was 
named CAA Rookie of the 
Week for his strong perfor-
mance. 
“That being my first 
collegiate game, going into 
that game and being able 
to win that award my first 
week out, it was definitely 
motivating and I was glad 
that I was able to do that for 
the team,” Ibitokun-Hanks 
said. “I want to do whatever 

it takes to put the team in 
the best position to win.”
After a disappointing 
week one, Croskey was de-
termined to put that behind 
him heading into UAlbany’s 
home opener against Rhode 
Island. 

Croskey delivered by 
running for 141 yards and 
two fourth quarter touch-
downs as UAlbany crushed 
Rhode Island 35-7. Like 
Ibitokun-Hanks before him, 
Croskey was named CAA 
Rookie of the Week for 

his performance. 

“[The award] means 
a lot, but I need to give 
most of the credit for the 
offensive line for making 
it possible,” Croskey said. 
“The offensive line had a 
great push throughout the 
game, which created a space 
for me to run.”
“He was focused in. He 
got confidence as he got 
more carries. That’s why we 
rode him out in the second 
half,” Bernard said.

UALBANY FIELD HOCKEY

By TROY FARKAS

Growing up playing field hockey in 
Berlin, Germany, Maxi Primus didn’t play 
goalie. 
It wasn’t until some coaches in her 
homeland got together and decided Pri-
mus’s fearless playing style would make 
her a fine goalkeeper one day that she took 
up the position.
 Now, Primus is the junior starting goal-
keeper for the University at Albany team, 
currently ranked fifth in the nation. 
In 2014, Primus became the first Great 
Dane field hockey player to ever earn All-
American honors when she was selected 
to the National Field Hockey Coaches As-
sociation (NFHCA) All-American Third 
Team. Primus also earned the award for 

best goalkeeper in the America East after 
helping the Danes defy the odds to make it 
all the way to the Final Four before a loss 
to the University of Connecticut.
 Primus made her way to UAlbany via 
her club team. High schools in Germany 
do not have field hockey teams, so coach-
es from around the world recruit German 
players based on their performances with 
the club teams. 
Primus, described as a, “very good get,” 
by head coach Phil Sykes, sent her videos 
to several schools in America but finally 
decided on UAlbany as the right place 
because of the coaching staff.
 Although Primus now excels at 
UAlbany both on and off the field, there 
was a time when, as a freshman, she 
struggled to adapt to her new life in a new 

country.
 Despite loving the East Coast on a 
family trip to the United States seven 
years ago, Primus wasn’t so sure how long 
she would want to stay here to play field 
hockey.
 “I said to the coaches I was going to 
stay for four years,” Primus said. “I came 
here and Paula, because we’re in the same 
year, got a really close relationship and we 
talked a lot. I was like, ‘If she leaves, I’m 
going to leave.’”
Primus is, of course, referring to Paula 
Heuser, last year’s National Player of the 
Year, who also hails from Germany. Heu-
ser originally had intended to stay for a 
season. After loving playing with the other 
members of the team, including Primus,

UAlbany fights back to tie CCSU 

MEN’S SOCCER

University at Albany men’s soccer 
team (3-2-1) fought for 110 minutes 
against Central Connecticut State 
(2-3-1) for 2-2 draw at Bob Ford Field 
Saturday night. The Great Danes were 
down most of the game, however 
sophomore Afonso Pinheiro scored 
two goals on the night. 
There is a reason the UAlbany 
men’s soccer team breaks records 
when it comes to filling the bleachers: 
they have the ability to go down a goal 
and respond with flare and class. A lot 
of this flare comes from Co-Rookie-of-
the-Year, Pinheiro on the front line. 
The Great Danes went down a goal 
just three minutes into the game off 
of a deflection in the six-yard box. 
CCSU’s Ryan Taylor got the goal, 

and just like that the Great Danes were 
down 1-0. The response, however, was 
that of class.
Great Dane midfielder, Pedro 
Espindola, took the ball down the flank 
beating several CCSU players to find 
Pinheiro central. Pinheiro did what he 
knows best, and buried the ball to the 
tie the game up 1-1 about 10 minutes 
into the first half. 
“It feels great to help the team by 
scoring in a tough match,” Pinheiro 
said. 
Pinheiro said that since the begin-
ning of the season the mentality of the 
team was to always stick together, no 
matter the adversities. 
Adversity came in the minute 17 
when a CCSU counter lead the Blue 
Devils to another goal for the 2-1 lead. 
The Blue Devils got a penalty kick 

and the shot went far right while Great 
Dane keeper, Danny Vitiello, dove 
left. 
The Great Danes continued to find 
momentum forward after the half with 
lots of fresh legs rotating through their 
offense.
“We added some great players 
to our program this year,” Pinheiro 
said.“Nico and Moosah came to create 
an instant impact to our group. Our 
attacking players are really danger-
ous and that gives our coach a lot of 
options.” 
Nico Solabarrieta and Moosah 
Khanat have seen a lot of time for the 
Great Danes, and Saturday it was 
apparent. Solabarrieta and Khanat add 
depth to the front line and brought 
about several chances in the first and
