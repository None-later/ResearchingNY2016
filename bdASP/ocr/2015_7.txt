   40 percent of food in the United 
States goes to waste, according 
to the U.S. Food and Agriculture 
Organization. This number has 
only increased over the past 
several years as many industries 
contribute to it. 
   The University at Albany 
decided to take a stand and show 
students exactly how much food 

they waste with the Display the 
Waste program. University dining 
halls had students measure how 
much food they threw away by 
disposing of their food in specified 
trash barrels. At the end of the 
event the amount of food thrown 
out was weighed. This event took 
place during lunch last Friday on 
October 17 in service of World 
Food Day. 
A major portion of this waste 

comes from colleges that have 
buffet style dining halls. 
According to UAlbany’s 
official website the school 
disposes of 2110 tons of garbage 
per year. The school annually 
recycles 320 tons of mixed paper, 
10 tons of glass, plastic, tin 
produce, 1.5 tons of tires, 1.75 
tons of motor oil, 6 tons of kitchen 
grease, and a half ton of battery 
waste. 

“If we can encourage students 
to be more mindful of what they 
put on their plate,” said Lauren 
Mancuso, the marketing director 
of UAlbany dining services, “then 
we will have accomplished what 
we set out to do.” 
Mancuso reported that 164 
pounds of cuisine was wasted at 
the Indian quad dining hall during 
the three-hour period of the event. 
“Just the process of emptying 

your plate into a receptacle was 
eye-opening to many students,” 
she said. 
Michigan State performed a 
similar study by measuring the 
pounds of food wasted per student 
per week. The average student 
wasted 1.54 pounds of food a 
day, which resulted in the college 
wasting about 99,337 pounds of 
food per week at a school of about

In the midst of the three recent school shootings, 
University at Albany students, faculty and parents are 
left wondering what precautions the university is taking 
to prevent school shootings on campus and what the 
protocol is in case this ever becomes a harsh reality for the 
University at Albany community. 
Over the span of nine days, Oct. 1 to Oct. 9, the nation 
lost 12 students to gun violence. On Oct. 1, Christopher 
Harper-Mercer opened fire at Umpqua Community 
College in Oregon killing 10 students and injuring 20. Just 
eight days later, two more college students were killed. 
Shortly after 1 a.m. on Oct. 9 an altercation between two 
groups of students outside a Northern Arizona University 
residence hall left one dead and three more in the hospital. 
Later that day, Texas Southern University lost a student 
to gun violence following a dispute outside a campus 
dormitory. 
Aran Mull, Deputy Chief of the UAlbany Police 
Department, said that campus shootings have a “profound 
impact on community and national psyche,” which is why 
prevention is key.
UPD is credited with creating the first New York State 
Division of Criminal Justice certified active shooter 
response training course. Through this course and basic 
training, UPD officers are taught to handle incidents 
that include the possession of a gun, bomb or knife. 
UPD looks at situations involving an active shooter and 
campus security on a national level, implementing these 
observations into their training programs to make them 
more effective. 
Mull said that prevention is not just the job of UPD, but 
that of the community as well. He encourages students 
to reach out to UAlbany CARE Services if they know 
someone who they believe may need help. University 
employees are provided with a link on their MYUAlbany 

account that has resources to help students who are 
perceived to be in crisis. 
“You’re helping someone from going down that road to 
deconstruction,” Mull said. “Make it so we don’t have to 
call about an active shooter, make a call when you notice 
someone needs help.”
The UPD website contains resources for students and 
faculty on education, prevention, and mitigation. The 
UAlbany community can go to http://police.albany.edu/
AShooter.shtml to find the “Run, Hide, Fight” video and 
PDF versions of the “Reporting and Resource Guide” and 
“Active Shooter Poster.” All three detail what to do if an 
active shooter is on campus. The “Reporting and Resource 
Guide” lists warning signs for students who may need 
help which range from a decline in grades and bizarre 
content in course work to exaggerated personality traits, 
verbal abuse and threatening behavior. 
In the event of an active shooter, individuals should 
know the entrances and exits in their classrooms and get 
out of there as quickly as possible
“Don’t just run, run to safety,” Mull said, reminding 
students that if an incident like this occurs cell phone 
signals may be down due to overuse, so don’t forget about 
the blue lights and red phones that are scattered across 
campus. 
UAlbany has only encountered one incident of an 
active shooter on campus since its creation in 1844. On 
Dec. 14, 1994 Ralph Tortorici, a 26-year-old psychology 
student, entered a History of Ancient Greece class armed 
with a .270-caliber Remington rifle according to The New 
York Times article from Dec. 15, 1994, titled “Gunman 
Terrorizes Students in Campus Siege.” 
Tortorici held 35 students and Prof. Hans Pohlsander 
hostage for over two and a half hours, while police 
attempted to negotiate with him from outside the 
classroom. It was the efforts of two students, one who 
knocked the rifle out of Tortorici’s hand and the other 

who was able to back him against a wall, that allowed 
police to arrest Tortorici and efficiently secure the area.
 In wake of the recent school shootings, UAlbany’s 
Student Association plans to host Protect YOU Albany, 
according to Emma Schwab, a senior who is head of the 
Student Assembly’s Civic Action committee. There will 
be a memorial for the recent lives lost and UPD will be 
there to provide information on campus safety and gun 
violence. A date has not yet been set, but it will be held by 
the small fountain in front of the Campus Center.

The aroma of coffee and tea filled the air 
as University at Albany students, faculty 
and community members gathered at 
Professor Java’s on Wednesday night to 
engage in a conversation regarding race in 
the United States.
This was the first “Java and Justice” 
held by the UAlbany Cornerstone Campus 
Ministry, and it used the Moral Monday 
Movement and Black Lives Matter as the 
basis for discussion, focusing on America’s 
race perception, both on a national and local 
level.
The conversation was led by the Rev. 
Sandy Damhof, director of UAlbany’s 
Cornerstone Campus Ministry, the Rev. 
Dr. Roxanne Jones Booth, a lecturer in 
the Africana Studies Department, Emily 
McNeill, the lead organizer of the Labor 
Religion Coalition, and Nayram Gasu, a 
senior at UAlbany who is a peer minister 
for social justice with the Cornerstone 
Campus Ministry.
The background of the speakers made 
for a theologically-led dialogue, however 
religion was not the main part of discussion. 
Gasu and Booth, in particular, chose to 
draw on the prevalence of the unconscious 
bias in regards to race.
“In Ghana everyone is black so it wasn’t 
until I came to America that I saw how 
much of a problem [race] is,” Gasu, who 
was born and raised in Ghana, said.
Booth read a quote from a 1968 Martin 
Luther King Jr. speech in which he said, 
“I do not see how we will ever solve the 
turbulent problem of race confronting our 
nation until there is an honest confrontation 
with it.”
Both agreed that race perception and 
discrimination are issues that are not 
going to just go away. The tone of the 
conversation led to the agreement that as 
a society, we need to discuss these issues 
even if they make us uncomfortable.
“White progressive culture tends to be 
averse to being uncomfortable... for a lot 
of my life I believed in saying things in a 
polite way,” McNeill said. “To see change 
we need to get people more uncomfortable 
and outraged.”
Damhof opened the conversation 
up to the rest of the room, encouraging 
individuals to either ask questions or share 
their own experiences with racism.
Brittany Bobb, the youth president of 

Hudson River Frontier Missionary Baptist 
Church in Albany chose to discuss the 
aggression that movements like Black 
Lives Matter is generally attributed to. 
She compared the aggression to when the 
youngest child in a family desires attention.
“They’ll shout until they’re heard,” Bobb 
said, explaining that even though this may 
seem aggressive, it draws people’s attention 
to the issue at hand.
The Moral Monday Movement started 
in North Carolina in 2013 with community 
and faith leaders, including the Rev. 
William Barber, president of the North 
Carolina’s NAACP chapter.
According to McNeill, community 
activists gathered to protest the State 
Legislature’s decisions on issues like public 
education, raising the minimum wage and 
higher taxes on the wealthy.
This movement has since spread to 
various states across the country and 
McNeill participates in the New York 
Moral Monday Movement that is held in 
the capitol.
The Cornerstone Campus Ministry plans 
to host a “Java and Justice” on the first 
Wednesday ofevery month, at Professor 
Java’s located at 217 Wolf Rd. to discuss 
a topic of the Moral Monday Movement. 
Next month’s topic of conversation will be 
the “Fight for the 15,” a discussion about 
raising the minimum wage.

When University at 
Albany sophomore Clinton 
Olaniyi created the Students 
of UAlbany Facebook page 

last year, he hoped it would 
centralize the main idea 
behind Humans of New 
York (HONY).
HONY, started by 
Brandon Stranton in 2010, 

features photographed 
portraits of citizens in 
New York City. Often, the 
caption will be a quote from 
the person.
Olaniyi has been 
following HONY for more 
than three years.
“I wanted to recreate 
HONY in such a way where 
you as a student can make 
some kind of connection 
to the post even on the 
most basic level, as we are 
all students of UAlbany,” 
Olaniyi said.
Although the page started 
with just him, there are 
now six active members 
who contribute to posting 
photos.
A team of two people 
will go out together to get 
content for the page.
“Because two people 
go out and shoot together, 
we only go out when our 
schedules match up,” 
Olaniyi said. “So that 
could mean 10 plus photos 
one week, and only three 
another.”
Currently, the most 
popular picture on the site 
is of a male student smiling 
from April of this year. The 
caption explains that if he 
could have three wishes, he

El Niño could mean a milder winter for the Capital Region

By CHRISTINA DINOTA

As fall settles in and the 
days start to get colder we are 
reminded of one thing: Winter is 
coming.
The good news is that 
forecasters are predicting a 
much milder winter than we’ve 
experienced in the last two years.
Thank El Niño for that.
 El Niño is a weather pattern 
in which a shift in trade winds 
causes unusually warm sea-
surface temperatures in the 
Pacific Ocean and results in 

weather impacts worldwide. 
This particular El Niño, which 
some meteorologists are calling 
“Bruce Lee,” is the strongest 
we’ve seen since 1997 and could 
possibly be the strongest ever 
recorded.
So what does this mean for the 
Capital Region?
We can expect “warmer-
than-average conditions for 
most of the winter especially 
in the middle of winter through 
the spring,” according to Paul 
E. Roundy, a professor of 
atmospheric and environmental 

sciences at the University at 
Albany.
It may be warmer, but there 
is still potential for a number of 
coastal storms, or nor’easters, to 
head our way this winter.
“Nearly all El Niño winters 
in the past have featured an 
active storm track across the 
southern United States, with a 
turn up the East Coast to New 
England,” according to a report 
by meteorologist Doug Gillham 
of the Weather Network.
In the report Gillham 
suggested that an active storm 

track will likely persist through 
this winter as well.
“Should just one big coastal 
storm come inland and hit 
us we could have a very wet 
winter,” said Roundy. “Given 
the temperature though some of 
those storms could bring us rain 
rather than snow.
Roundy pointed out that 
though “statistics suggest a 
higher probability that more of 
the precipitation in this winter 
season will be rain,” this doesn’t 
eliminate the chance of major 
snowfall over the season because 

individual weather events may 
bring cold fronts.
The effects of El Niño are 
hard to predict. Past El Niño 
events can give us an idea of 
what to expect, but there are 
different factors that play a part 
in the development of each one.
“The most comparable events 
of the past are the El Niño events 
of 1982-83 and 1997-98, but we 
still don’t know what to expect,” 
Roundy said. “Strong patterns 
like this just don’t happen often.”

The University at 
Albany has partnered with 
Rochester Polytechnic 
Institute, and Union College 
in the fight to end hunger 
in the New York’s Capital 
Region. 
Through their Coffee for 
a Cause initiative, Sodexo—

UAlbany’s food service 
provider—will donate  cents 
to the Regional Food Bank 
of Northeastern New York 
for every cup of coffee 
purchased on campus until 
March 4. 
In 2014, the food bank 
donated 32.3 million pounds 
of food to 23 counties 
throughout the state, most 

of which—3,914,042 
pounds—went to Albany.
“We should be able raise 
enough for at least 4,000 
pounds of food,” says Alexa 
Eaglestone, Sodexo’s Area 
Marketing Coordinator on 
the UAlbany campus. “I’m 
confident that we’ll reach 
that.”

IT’S A CULTURE, NOT A COSTUME

By DANIEL PINZON

Halloween is known as a day to dress up, a 
day to be something either imaginary or real, 
a day to play pretend. 
However, some costumes that people dress 
up as are offensive. Out of all the costumes 
to choose from, how did race, ethnicity, and 
culture become choices?
Most of these costumes are based 
completely on stereotypes. There is no real 
reference to the culture, which is the problem 
when people try to dress up as another race. 
People may dress up as a stereotype for shits 
and giggles, but that doesn’t help society 
become less entrenched in stereotypes. 
It’s disappointing and damaging to dress 
as a stereotype and be identified as a certain 
race. For instance, if a person paints his face 
yellow and squint his eyes so people know, 
“Oh, I guess you’re Asian for Halloween.” 
Or if a person wears a sombrero with a 
mustache, others would see that as dressing 
up as a Mexican person. The simplicity of 
costumes encourages stereotypes. In reality, 
these stereotypes do not capture a culture’s 
essence. 
That’s the thing. It’s Halloween, and 
people can dress as anything imaginable. 
Whether it’s a last-minute idea or an 
elaborate attempt to be funny, I would rather 
people stay away from race as a costume 
idea. There’s more to these people than the 
color of their skin and their physical features. 
Why would anyone want to pinpoint the 
negatives of a culture and display that to the 
world? A person may argue that they have 
seen many of these people act a certain way 
and therefore the stereotype is true. That’s 
not the case. Stop generalizing. Take into 
consideration that other people also define 
the culture and that stereotypes aren’t true.
If a person is not a member of that cultural 

society, then they won’t be able portray 
that culture in its purity. They can observe 
another culture and study from what they 
learned, but it doesn’t make the person a part 
of that culture. A person can embrace another 
culture and allow influence in his culture, 
however that doesn’t establish a new culture 
for oneself. 
I’m Colombian, and if I were to see 
someone with a bag of white powder labeled 
“cocaine” in one hand and a cup of coffee in 
another, I would be offended that not only 
does one think that this simple equation 
equals Colombia, but also that the person 
disregarded all other aspects of that culture. 
Cultures and ethnicities, including 
Africans, Native Americans and Muslims, 
are generally the go-to “costumes.” These 
are the cultures the United States has had 
bad history with: We took the land from 
the Native Americans, we can never forget 
slavery of African-Americans, and a Muslim 
costume is typically linked to terrorism.
I’m against costumes that are blatantly 
stereotypical. If someone was to actually 
do research of a culture and portray an 
icon of that culture, though, I think that’s 
permissible. 
“WE’RE A CULTURE, NOT A 
COSTUME. YOU WEAR THE COSTUME 
FOR ONE NIGHT. I WEAR THE STIGMA 
FOR LIFE.” A the flyer on Eastman Tower’s 
lobby bulletin board best explains it, 
accompanied by a powerful photo taken by 
Leah Woodruff. The flyer was in all caps to 
show how upsetting it can be when people 
dress up as another’s culture.
Why take a chance and possibly offend 
someone when it’s just as easy to be a 
dragon, a zombie or a vampire? Halloween 
already lost its true meaning of scaring away 
the ghosts, so why not dress up as a ghost? 
Why be a human on Halloween?

Ahmed Mohamed made national 
headlines when a clock he built was 
mistaken for a bomb. The 14-year-old 
ninth grader from Texas received a lot of 
support nationwide with a Twitter hashtag 
#IStandWithAhmed, even receiving 
recognition from President Obama. 
Obama tweeted the young man, saying, 
“Cool clock, Ahmed. Want to bring it to 
the White House? We should inspire more 
kids like you to like science. It’s what 
makes America great.” 
He also received praise from Hillary 
Clinton and Mark Zuckerburg, the creator 
of Facebook. The story, however, doesn’t 
stop there. 
It’s barely been a month since the 
incident, but a costume company hasn’t 
wasted any time using this controversy 
to their advantage. Costumeish.com, an 
online costume retailer, launched an ad 
for a costume designed after Mohamed. 
It contains a NASA T-shirt, a pair of 
glasses, a clock, and a pair of handcuffs. 
The price for the costume was $80. 
Daily Mail had reached out to the CEO 
of the online company, Johnathon Weeks, 
and asked if people were actually buying 

them. “Yes, we have sold a few of them so 
far,” Weeks said. The company is known 
for making controversial costumes. 
Some people took to Twitter to express 
their distaste for the costume. One 
said,  “This year we should have a law 
permitting the slapping of anyone in an 
Ahmed Mohamed costume.” Another user 
said it was a terrible idea. 
Halloween is a fun time for many 
people, and costumes are generally 
harmless. Sometimes however, it is 
taken a little too far. Being a person that 
likes the more creative costumes, I see 
ones like this and not only do I think 
it is offensive and mocking, but I also 
think it lacks creativity. Even traditional 
costumes can be touched up to be unique. 
Halloween is that one day a year where a 
person can dress up as anything they want 
to. Why would anyone choose to dress 
up as Mohamed? I see it as degrading 
and embarrassing for Mohamed and his 
family.
All controversial costumes are going 
to be offensive one way or another, but I 
cannot help but wonder where the line is 
drawn. When do the people who come up 
with costume ideas ask themselves, is this 
going too far? That line should have been

Mohamed is just a child, so I do 
not think that this costume should 
have ever been up for sale in the 
first place. 
His family said in a press 
release that he has been severely 
traumatized by the whole incident. 
Now, with his religion being 
brought into the matter, it could 
be seen as racist, which is not a 
laughing matter. 
I find Halloween to be more fun 
when we think of the costumes 
ourselves and the ways we can 
make them stand out, not by 
turning a controversial issue into 
something less serious than it is. 
The Daily Dot, the website that 
initially created the costume, has 
since pulled it from their market. 
However, they went on to mention 
how easily people could make it 
themselves at home. Let’s just 
hope that nobody takes that route.

Pink ribbons 
symbolizing breast 
cancer awareness helped 
decorate the stage at 
Crossgates Mall on Oct. 
10. Models strutted down 
the illuminated runway, 
wearing high-end designer 
clothing and a wide range 
of colorful accessories. But 
these are not the typical 
kind of models one would 
see during New York 
Fashion Week. 
The 20 women who 
appeared on stage were 
breast cancer survivors, 
mostly middle-aged, from 
the Capitol Region who 
were previously diagnosed 
but managed to win 
their battles. The overall 
atmosphere during the 
third annual Breast Cancer 
Fashion Show was positive 
and hopeful, with survivors 
wearing smiles throughout 
the event. 
As October is Breast 
Cancer Awareness Month, 
the event was intended to 
reflect how beating the 
disease and maintaining 
confidence is possible, 
even if it seems scary when 
one is first diagnosed. 
Crossgates Mall helped 
raised money for To 
Life!, a local non-profit 
organization that provides 
support and resources to 
people diagnosed with 
breast cancer while aiming 

to raise more awareness 
about the disease to local 
people.
Sponsored by Lord & 
Taylor and radio stations 
Fly 92.3 and 100.9 The 
Cat, entry was free and 
open to the general public. 
“In most of the cases, 
the models that are with us 
today, they’ve completed 
their journey with breast 
cancer,” Eileen Howe 
Bird, the executive director 
of To Life!, said in an 
interview with WNYT. 
“So we’re here to celebrate 
with them and to focus 
on not just their outward 
persona—which is going to 
be improved by the clothes 
they have and some really 
fun stuff—but their inner 
peace and the journey that 
they’ve gone through.”
Throughout the 
fashion show, the emcee 
introduced each model, 
providing a brief backstory 
on what her battle with 
breast cancer was like, how 
she found out she had it 
and how life has been like 
since then. 
The women were 
styled with different 
outfits from designers 
like Michael Kors, Lord 
& Taylor, Calvin Klein, 
Ralph Lauren, Elie Tahari, 
Ivanka Trump and Jessica 
Simpson. Each survivor’s 
family and friends also 
attended the event, 
applauding and cheering 

to give support the entire 
time.
The emcee also offered 
the audience many tips on 
how to lower one’s risk of 
getting breast cancer, but 
stressed that there is no 
100 percent guarantee to 
prevent it.
“Keep a healthy weight 
level, exercise regularly, 
limit alcohol consumption 
to one drink a day and 
try to reduce exposure to 
radiation,” she said. “It 
is also really important 
that you go for regular 
checkups or screenings 
and you might think like, 
‘Oh I don’t feel sick, I’m 
healthy!’ But that’s how it 
usually is. It’s when you 
don’t feel sick that you 
do find something like a 
lump, so please go for your 
checkups.”
She also said that 
men should also go for 
checkups because, while 
breast cancer mostly 
affects women, it can also 
affect men. She concluded 
that everyone should get 
six to eight hours of sleep 
daily. 
The fashion show 
ended with all the breast 
cancer survivors returning 
to the stage for a group 
shot while To Life! was 
given a $1,000 check 
from Crossgates Mall, 
getting a standing ovation 
and applause from the 
audience.

Breast cancer survivors 
keep strutting forward

By LOUIS SMITH

Albany Barn, located in the Arbor Hill community, 
has been dubbed a “sustainable creative arts incubator,” 
offering a digital multimedia studio, lofts and studios 
available for artists, workshops, concerts and fashion shows 
among other things. 
Operating since 2006, Albany Barn has grown into a 
one-of-a-kind venue for the area, a movement that stemmed 
from Barn masterminds teaming up with the Albany 
Housing Authority and the City of Albany to generate 
the venue, renovating a decrepit and unused St. Joseph’s 
Academy to complete their vision. 
The ASP had the opportunity to chat with Albany Barn’s 
Director Kristen Holler, who shared various elements of 
her and her team’s special vision, one that has catapulted 
the non-profit to the forefront of the Capital Region’s 
independent music crusade. 
Albany Student Press: What has been the best vehicle 
for marketing your services to the artistic community?
Kristen Holler: I think social media has been huge for us, 
and not only marketing our services but trying to keep a 
vibrant presence on social media. So, we’re also sharing 
articles and tips on how to be successful as a creative 
professional. We’re [also] using that as an avenue to 
talk about available studio space, rehearsal rooms and 
apartments and things like that at the Barn.
ASP: Since its creation, what has been the biggest 
obstacle the Barn has had to overcome?
KH: From a purely logistical standpoint, the redevelopment 
of St. Joseph’s Academy was a massive undertaking. 
Communicating information that related to our plans and 
how that fit into the neighborhood plan and the housing 
authority’s plan in order to apply for funding, and making 
sure that all the partners were on the same page throughout 

this whole redevelopment process. I wouldn’t call that 
an obstacle, but it was a major area of growth for us as 
a startup, not-for-profit to be working with such a well-
established organization and to really be able to advocate 
for the artists’ community.
ASP: Would you say that overall education and 
awareness is an ongoing struggle for the Barn?
KH: It’s definitely an ongoing thing for us. We’re looking 
at ways to improve what we’re doing. Some things we’re 
looking at in the next year are overhauling our website and 
making it more obvious from the start all of the different 
facets of what we do and ways that people can involve 
themselves.
ASP: The art scene is massive, there’s all different types 
of arts, different mediums. When it comes to generating 
a community response, what art would you say really 
speaks to the community and gets a positive reaction?
KH: One of the big conversations we’re having is not only 
how do we get people to come out and enjoy, but how 
do we get them to participate and how do we get them 

to participate in a way that leaves them in a better place 
than they were than they started? We’re giving people a 
unique experience, an experience that allows them not just 
to consume art or to make art but to really develop some 
underlying skills. The response has been most positive 
when we are dealing with music, fashion and the culinary 
arts. Whenever we do live art making - when people can get 
a glimpse into the creative process - I think people really 
enjoy that also.
ASP: A lot of people say that when you’re starting 
businesses, location is everything. In your experience, 
would you have it any other way, in terms of the 
physical location of the Barn itself?
KH: I think that there is a real spirit to Arbor Hill, and it’s 
so historically rich and there’s just so much interesting 
stuff here - so much interesting history, so many interesting 
people that have been here. For me, I love where we are. 
There’s real vision here, and there’s real care here. When 
we first started talking about the Barn, there wasn’t a 
location. It was just that we were going to support artists, 
and they in turn would have an impact on the community, 
wherever that community would be.
ASP: From your personal experience, what is one 
piece of advice that you would give to this next up-
and-coming generation of artists, are really looking to 
branch out into the independent, local art scene?
KH: The people that I have seen that are the most 
successful do two things. Number one, they treat it like 
a job and they get up every day as their most authentic 
selves and they go to work. You have to work. I’m going to 
quote Ashton Kutcher - he said in some acceptance speech, 
“opportunity looks a lot like hard work,” and that’s true. 
Number two is, the people who are the most successful that 
I have seen are also great connectors of people.

ALBANY BARN FOSTERS LOCAL TALENT

By JULIA DAY

    It’s no normal weekend in New York 
City when you see Darth Vader buying a 
subway ticket, Princess Peach jaywalking, 
and Thor ordering a Frappuccino at 
Starbucks. No, ladies and gents, this can 
only be seen during the most wonderful 
time of the year, and I’m not talking about 
Christmas.
    Beginning on Thursday, Oct. 8 and 
ending on Sunday, Oct. 11, New York 
Comic Con took the Jacob K. Javits 
Convention Center by storm with record 
breaking attendance numbers. The annual 
four day pop culture event celebrated its 
tenth anniversary this year, the first official 
NYCC having taken place in February 
2006. Over the years the convention has 
exponentially grown, starting off with 
33,000 attendees in 2006, to now over 
170,000 attendees in 2015.
    Although not as highly publicized as its 
West Coast cousin San Diego Comic Con, 
NYCC has attracted several geek legends 
each year including Kevin Smith, Stan 
Lee, Joss Whedon, Adam West, William 
Shatner, Patrick Stewart, and others. This 
year a few notable guests included Nathan 
Fillion, the star of the ABC series “Castle” 
and fan favorite “Firefly,” as well as Bryan 
Cranston, Walter White from the Emmy 
award winning show “Breaking Bad.”
    While SDCC used to hold the title for 
largest North American fan convention, 
NYCC has quickly stolen the position. 
The San Diego Convention Center caps 
its attendance at 130,000 attendees due to 
the spacing of its venue. Now, NYCC tops 
that attendance by nearly 40,000 more. 
Part of the reason for this increase is due 
to the expansion to the off site location 
Hammerstein Ballroom which hosted 
several panels.
    Comic cons, or fan conventions for 
comic, television, film, and art enthusiasts, 
happen all throughout the United States. 
Albany Comic Con took place earlier 
this month on Oct. 4 on Wolf Road 
featuring vintage comics, toys, and other 
collectibles.
Fan conventions have increasingly become 
more popular all over the world.
    “Comic conventions in India and 
China, not previously considered 
hotbeds of fandom for these kind of 
pop culture properties, are approaching 
100,000 [attendee] levels and growing 
at a blistering rate, reflecting the vast 
population of those countries,” said Forbes.
com contributing writer Rob Salkowitz.
    NYCC lived up to its reputation this 
year, serving up fans numerous sneak-peak 
panels, meet-and-greets with celebrities, 
creative cosplays, and a massive show 
floor of vendors. Panel topics ranged 
from Nickelodeon’s “Teenage Mutant 
Ninja Turtles,” ABC Family’s “Pretty 
Little Liars,” Marvel’s “Jessica Jones and 

Daredevil,” and others. 
     Nathan Fillion, Jewel Staite, and Gina 
Torres returned for a special reunion 
panel of the cult-classic space western 
“Firefly.” Show creator Chris Carter and 
actors David Duchovny and Mitch Pillegi 
appeared at an exclusive panel for the 
‘90s sci-fi favorite “The X-Files,” which 
screened the upcoming season premiere set 
to hit television screens in January 2016.
     Numerous comic book artists and 
writers flooded the hall of Artist’s Alley, 
featuring original prints and sketches for 
sale. Stopping by a booth in the alley I was 
able to meet with Grek Pak, a comic book 
writer known for his work with Marvel 
comics, as well as the graphic novel “Code 
Monkey Save World.”
    Vendors on the main show floor 
were selling a wide array of pop culture 
merchandise including T-shirts, action 
figures, plushies, and of course, comic 
books. Some booths selling vintage comics 
had lists prices that climbed to thousands 
of dollars. One of the most expensive 
comics for sale was “Amazing Fantasy 
#15,” which was released in 1962 and 
known as the title that first introduced the 
popular superhero Spider-Man. The list 
price for this rare comic was $20,995.95.
     Perhaps the most exciting element of 
NYCC is the enthusiasm of the cosplayers. 
Many attendees this year dressed up 
as Marty McFly and Doc Brown from 
“Back to the Future,” in honor of the 
film’s 30 year anniversary. A hilarious 
impersonation of Peter Griffin from 
“Family Guy” appeared at Comic Con 
throughout the weekend. One group of 
cosplayers dressed as the cast of “Jurassic 
World,” with their very own Indominus 
rex.
     Actors Jared Leto, The Joker in 
“Suicide Squad” and Mark Ruffalo, the 
Hulk from “The Avengers,” also attended 
NYCC, but were able to go undetected 
by fans as they had cosplays of their own, 
masking their faces. On Leto’s official 
Instagram page, he posted a picture of 
himself cosplaying in a monkey mask 
alongside of a fan dressed as The Joker, 
adding the caption: “He had no idea.”
     University at Albany student Iris Brody 
attended the event on Friday along with 
friends. At the Konami booth on the main 
show floor, Brody was able to create her 
own personalized “Yu-Gi-Oh!” playing 
card.
     “Comic Con was everything I expected 
and more,” said Brody. “The fact that I 
have a ‘Yu-Gi-Oh!’ card with my face on it 
makes it all worth it…It was so nice seeing 
so many people with the same likes who I 
could nerd out with.”
     NYCC continues to expand and 
improve each year. The date for NYCC 
2016 is already set, and will take place 
next Oct. 6 to Oct. 9. One can only imagine 
what’s in store for next year.

By PATRICK TINE 

Brian Tolle was never supposed to be an artist. The 
51-year-old was supposed to graduate from the University at 
Albany and put his political science degree into practice. But 
like so many of his fellow students, past and present, long 
hours at the State Legislature not only burned him out, but 
also disillusioned him. 
In forgoing a career as a politico, he gained a subject which 
has defined him as an artist. “I used to come home from the 
State House and just draw,” Tolle recalls. “I did it just to 
decompress.” 
His early flirtation with politics drove him to a subject he 
has been exploring and examining since the 1980s. Though 
he has range (he was the artist behind the bewitching Irish 
Hunger Memorial in Battery Park City) the principal object of 
his attention is the United States. 
In a retrospective exhibition of his work at the University 
Art Museum entitled “Bordering Utopia” the public is 
treated to an enigmatic display of American abstraction. His 
works “Levittown” and “Simnai Didro (Twisted Chimney)” 

immediately confront and demand the attention of any visitor 
to this new show. 
“Simnai Didro” is a meditation on the American 
hearthside. Two towering stone chimneys made of Styrofoam 
are the first objects that greet a visitor to the gallery. They 
loom over the rest of the works on display and seem to 
criticize the death of American geniality and family life. 
On the wall to “Didro’s” left we are treated to Tolle’s 
most striking creation, “Levittown.” It is another looming 
piece (Tolle certainly favors a grand scale) but affixed to 
the wall. It is a black and white photograph of a Long Island 
potato farming family, with a blueprint of a monotonous 
suburb, Levittown, superimposed over it. This sprawling 
development, which would soon render the farmlands of 
Long Island permanently fallow, hangs over the family, like a 
massive and malevolent setting sun. 
Tolle’s artwork is challenging. “I am conceptual, not 
aesthetic,” he said. More than challenging, some of it is quite 
strange. On the second floor, disconcerting depictions of 
quintessentially American suburban objects dominate. Tolle 
uses lurid linoleum floors and twisted, colorful children’s 

bicycles to tell a sad story of American excess. 
“I realized I didn’t want to be a political scientist and for a 
moment wasn’t sure what to do,” Tolle said. So, Tolle went 
to New York City. “After I graduated from [the University 
at Albany] in 1986 I sold costume jewelry at Macy’s. And 
I kept drawing,” Tolle said. Eventually, friends of his who 
were in the process of “making it” in the cutthroat New York 
art world began complimenting him on his artwork and 
encouraged him to be more serious about it. 
Thus began a torrential amount of effort. Tolle took art 
classes at Parsons, The New School for Design in Manhattan. 
He honed his talents while continuing to work at Macy’s, 
surviving on just a few hours sleep a night. 
The work paid off and soon a style coalesced. His most 
famous work is not on display at the University Art Museum 
retrospective because it is literally monumental. His Irish 
Hunger Memorial in New York City, which almost literally 
teleports the visitor to the greenery of Ireland, is emblematic 
of his style. “I do meticulous research and I hope a good idea 
comes out of it,” Tolle said. 
That artistic discipline and dedication to research are 
evident in his “Levittown” pieces which make keen use of 
archival blueprints to create an unsettling commentary on the 
American suburb. 
Today, Tolle is a force in the world of American visual art. 
In addition to the University Art Museum, his work has been 
showcased at the Whitney Biennale and at the Tate Modern 
in London. When asked to recall the marathon six-hour art 
classes for which Parsons is famous, Tolle said: “I teach those 
classes now.”

There are four dining halls (Indian dining hall, State dining hall, Colonial dining hall, and Dutch dining hall) 
on the UAlbany campus, along with the Campus Center where food could be wasted.

Jazzman’s, the new coffee store in the newly opened UAlbany Campus Center, will donate two cents to the 
Regional Food Bank of Northeastern New York for every cup of coffee purchased on campus until March 4.

47,800 students. 
Virginia Tech students 
also performed a study over 
the course of two weeks. 
The campus had a total of 
169,055 pounds of edible 
food wasted and then an additional 202,797 pounds of compost 
waste. 
Many food organizations, such as End Food Waste now, believe 
that the all-you-can-eat aspect of many college dining halls is the 
reason for food waste. The unlimited amount of food encourages 
students to load up as much food on their trays. Many students take 
advantage of this system to get their moneys worth, but leads to 
larger mounts of wasted food. 
The End Food Waste Now organization believes that tray-less 
dining is a guaranteed way to decrease waste in dining halls. The 
organization has noticed this trend at multiple schools. American 
University wasted 14.4 percent less food after using tray-less dining 
and Alfred University saw a similar decrease of 30-50 percent.
The University of Maine at Farmington reduced its food waste 
by 25-30 percent when they got rid of their trays. This conserved 
290 thousand gallons of water from dishwashing and saved $57 
thousand worth of resources. Virginia Tech also noticed a 29 
percent drop in food waste in their first two weeks of tray-less 
dining. 
UAlbany has numerous recycling and waste reduction programs 
the school participates in on their website. UAlbany also has 
participated in RecycleMania for many years. The current 
RecycleMania race has reused an average of 5.401 pounds of 
material per person so far this year on campus. 
The Give and Go program is another event held every May at 
UAlbany. This program encourages students to donate unneeded 
items from their dorm room, such as old furniture, fridge, or 
television sets instead of throwing them out when it’s time to vacate 
the dorms. The dates and locations for the Give and Go program are 
announced towards the end of the spring semester. 
UAlbany also encourages students to get rid of their waste in 
other ways as well. Clothing exchange drives are held regularly 
throughout the semester. The university also encourages students 
to compost during the spring. These programs can be found at 
UAlbany’s Green Scene page.

This year the ASP turns 100!

According to Feeding 
America, a nation-wide 
network of food banks, 48.1 
million Americans lived in 
“food insecure households” in 
2014, including 32.8 million 
adults, and 15.3 million children. Such families must 
choose monthly between paying for food, and paying rent 
and mortgage bills.
Albany County’s poverty rate sits at around 25 percent, 
according to the Hunger Action Network of New York 
State. In 2012, the United States Department of Agriculture 
published a study by Feed America that found 14.8 percent 
of minors to be “food insecure,” or not having the resources 
to maintain adequate nutrition. 
“We help feed 325,000 people a year,” Mark Quandt, 
Executive Director of the Food Bank, said in an e-mail on 
Friday. Roughly 40 percent of those fed by the food bank—
about 125,000—are children.
UAlbany is one of the first three campuses to host the 
program, which Eaglestone and a partner developed “as 
a local community initiative to engage students, faculty 
and staff across different campuses in the region and bring 
awareness to the cause,” according to a press release on 
Friday.
“It’s something that people buy every day,” says 
Eaglestone on why the duo decided on cups of coffee to 
support the the agenda. 
“I think it’s awesome”, says UAlbany Baseball head 
coach Jon Mueller. “To see a kid not have enough food 
in their belly is a tough thing to handle. Anytime that 
you’re able to help out one of these organizations [make a 
difference] is a wonderful thing.” 
“It’s definitely a step in the right direction,” says 
UAlbany freshman Kevin Rupnic as he picks up his own 
warm brew at Jazzman’s Brew and Bakery in the Campus 
Center. “If they could donate more, that’d be great, but it’ll 
add up.”

to talk to sea lions.
“You do know 
you can wish to talk 
to animals, right?” 
one of the Student of 
UAlbany members asked him.
“If you can talk to every animal, then you would have 
to understand what every stupid pigeon on the sidewalk 
is saying,” the student said.
When Olaniyi asks someone if he can take a picture of 
them, he is always prepared to explain why.
“I tell them, ‘What we do is walk around campus and 
randomly select students to interview, take their picture 
and then attach a quote or something interesting that 

they say.’”
He starts talking to the person using small talk but 
finds that people quickly start saying more.
“Everyone has a story and wants to tell it once they 
feel comfortable enough with you,” he said. “The first 
few minutes is me building a level of comfort and trust 
with the person.”
Olaniyi tries to read the person’s emotions and ask 
them questions about why they are feeling a certain way.
“The interview turns into a conversation,” he said. But 
no interview is the same. “Usually we don’t try to have 
programmed questions.”
He has to be prepared to ask more universal questions 
if he finds a person is not very conversational. Olaniyi’s 

go-to questions include “What do you like or hate about 
UAlbany?” and “Tell me something about yourself that 
no one else knows.”
The Students of UAlbany page currently has nearly 
1,000 likes on Facebook. The first post was made on 
March 2. Since then, there have been more than 20 
pictures posted.
Olaniyi said he finds joy in what he does for Students 
of UAlbany.
“I have learned that everyone wants to talk and tell 
their story but there aren’t enough listeners in this 
world,” he said. “To be able to be that ear that someone 
so desperately needs is an amazing feeling, especially 
when you don’t know the person.”

The Great Danes struggled 
mightily on offense through-
out the game, but had their 
moments in the first half. 
With 11:18 left in the second 
quarter, with the ball at the 
Villanova 17 yard line, DJ 
Crook complete a pass to 
Zee Roberson. As Roberson 
picked up the first down and 
looked to be heading for a 
game-changing touchdown, 
he fumbled the ball at the 
5-yard line and Villanova 
recovered.  
UAlbany appeared to be in 
position to score once again 
with the ball at the Villanova 
2 yard line with 20 seconds 
left in the half. The Great 
Danes, with no timeouts 
left, scrambled to get a field 
goal attempt. Even though 
Patrick Toole’s kick was 
good before time expired, 
a flag negated the kick and 
UAlbany took a 10-0 deficit 
into the locker room. After 

the late flag, Gattuso chased 
down the referees on the 
field to dispute the call, to 
no avail. 
“I need better time 
management at the end of 
the half,” said Gattuso. “That 
was on me.” 
The third quarter saw the 
UAlbany offense implode 
as quarterback DJ Crook 
threw three interceptions. He 
completed 13 of 24 passing 
on the game but was yanked 
in the fourth quarter because 
of his multiple turnovers.  
“I got to go through my 
reads and I got to do my job 
better,” said Crook. “I wasn’t 
doing my job and putting my 
team in a good position.” 
Villanova scored on three 
consecutive plays between 
the third and fourth quarters, 
extending their lead to 37. 
The lone bright spot in the 
game for the Great Danes 
was a block on the extra 
point attempt by Gerard 
Smith.  
For the Wildcats, 
Bednarczyk was a perfect 
12 for 12 on the game to 

go along with 152 yards 
and two touchdowns. Six 
different Wildcats rushed 
for over 20 yards on the 
afternoon. 
After Crook was pulled 
from the game, UAlbany 
backup quarterback Neven 
Sussman had his first 
pass attempt of the game 
intercepted by Villanova’s 
Cameron McCurry. 
The Great Danes were 
flat in the second half 
and were outscored 27-
0. Villanova outgained 
UAlbany 421-232 and 
scored 20 points off 
UAlbany turnovers.   
“We had a great first 
half, but in the second half 
we crumbled,” defensive 
lineman Samuel Gray 
said. “We didn’t come out 
on fire like we should’ve 
been.” 
The Great Danes fall to 
2-5 with the loss, while the 
Wildcats improve to 3-3. 
The Great Danes’ next 
game is against Richmond  
on Halloween in Virginia.

game as Albany topped UMass Lowell. 

defense.         
About half way into the 
second half, senior Jake 
Barros brought some more 
flare to the game and roar 
to the crowd by burying the 
ball in the net via a header 
pass from freshman Nico 
Solabarietta. 
 “It felt really great to 
score that goal,” Barros 
said. “Nico left the ball 
behind; I picked up the 
loose ends and just put it in 
the net.”
By domination of play 
and leading the score 2-0, 
fans watching the game 
from the recently renamed 
Casey Stadium were 
confident that the Danes 
would finish up the chilly 
night with another victory. 
But UMass Lowell 
surprised everyone when 
the ball hit the back of 
the net behind UAlbany 
goalkeeper Michael Pizzuti. 
Confusion arose on and 
off the field, as the goal 
looked as if may have been 
offside, leaving the referees 
to review the play, and 
while the players waited 
anxiously.
The referees said the goal 
was good, and the River 
Hawks were on the board 
thanks to junior Guilherme 
Rodrigues, who brought a 
little hope and confidence 
back for his team. The 
team’s renowned ambitious 
energy certainly showed 
when they saw more time 
in Great Danes’ dangerous 
territory during the final 
minutes than they had the 
whole game.     

In the last five minutes, 
the Danes focused 
mainly on defending and 
reclaiming ball possession, 
however, keeping it mostly 
out of reach for UMass.
This left UMass falling 
short and UAlbany 
celebrating the win at the 
sound of the buzzer.    
“We just kept the ball 
and played smart the way 
we know how to. We 
played it long if we had to, 
but used short passes and 
communication too,” said 
Barros.
Another victory for the 
Great Danes means they 
need to keep up the hard 
work and maintain the 
energy they demonstrated 
so well this Saturday.       
“We’re really pleased 
to get another conference 
victory here at home. 
We have to now learn to 
how to play with leads 
in the second half when 
opponents start to press 
higher or take more risks,” 
Gorman said. “But, if 
we’re in that position, it 
means we’re winning, and 
it feels better to learn that 
lesson than it would others. 
We’ve been showing a lot 
of good signs over the past 
few weeks, and as for our 
winning momentum, we’re 
just going to try not to 
break it.”

game at Boston University

How much does it take 
to feed a 6’5”, 280-pound 
offensive lineman? 
Kevin Malloy, a redshirt 
junior for the University 
at Albany football team, 
needs a lot to fuel his 
body throughout the day. 
Malloy’s favorite breakfast 
is a serving of five to six 
scrambled eggs with ham 
and cheese, six to eight 
waffles, 10 maple sausage 
links and two pieces of toast 
with a glass of orange juice. 
He is eating all this after 
downing a 20-ounce, 64-
gram protein shake. 
Malloy wakes up to an 
old-fashioned alarm clock 
that blasts on his bedside at 
5:30 a.m. He pulls his body 
out of bed and heads to 
lift and go to meetings. By 
the time Malloy has lifted 
a combined weight of an 
entire women’s sports team, 
and studied the upcoming 
opponent for Saturday, most 
of us are still sound asleep. 
The Long Island native 
and Third-Team All-CAA 
Offensive Line looks 
forward to the after-morning 
grind because it means he 
can head back to his house 
downtown and cook up that 
big breakfast before heading 
back to campus for classes 
and practice.
Malloy got switched to 
left tackle from tight end last 
year. Malloy stood at 250 
pounds, which meant he had 
to put on about 30 pounds to 

fit the new position. 
“From forcing myself to 
eat a lot more I’ve gained 
the 25 pounds. I was 285 
pounds before the season 
but since we don’t lift as 
much as the off season I’ve 
lost a little,” he said. Despite 
Malloy’s small weight-loss 
in season, the coaching staff 
and he agree that 285 to 295 
pounds is a good range for 
him to be of ultimate use 
without losing too much 
speed.  
Malloy’s daily schedule 
puts a lot of emphasis on 
good diet habits. To play 
in the left tackle position 
size and strength is vital. A 
lot of students and student-
athletes brush off certain 
meals knowing that they 
don’t need to worry about 
dropping a pound or two 
here, but for Malloy and 
the UAlbany football team, 
eating is a form of training 
for them. 
Malloy drinks about two 
to four protein shakes a day, 
snacks on peanut butter 
and jelly sandwiches, and 
always has a protein-rich 
dinner. While eating is a 
part of Malloy’s schedule, 
training and going to school 
also fills up his day.
Every day is different 
for Malloy. Monday is the 
football team’s off-day, 
but he still uses the time 
to study film. Tuesdays 
he is up at 6:15 a.m. for 
meetings at 7 a.m., class at 
8:45 a.m., then back home 
to eat, study and prepare for 

practice later that afternoon. 
By noon, Malloy is back 
on campus to get treatment 
before meetings at 2 p.m. 
and practice at 3 p.m. 
Practice goes until 5:15 
p.m., and then treatment 
follows. Malloy said he’s 
usually in bed by 10 p.m. on 
weeknights because his days 
are so long. 
Each weekday is packed 
with meetings, lifting, 
classes, studying, practicing, 
treatment and eventually 
sleeping. Malloy uses 
reading, music and family 
dinners with his teammates 
to re-focus after long days. 
“I love Ed Sheeran, he’s 
amazing,” Malloy said. 
Saturday is game day, so 
for Malloy his weeks are 
centered around preparing 
for that one day a week 
during which he can wear 
the number 67 proudly and 
represent the school. Malloy 
said he is a completely 
different person on and off 
the field, so for those of you 
who see a 6’5” guy in the 
process of growing out a 
mustache that looks like he 
might steal your lunch and 
your girl, don’t be alarmed. 
He’s actually a big teddy 
bear off the field.
“I think on the field 
I'm relentless and really 
physical. I like hitting 
people and putting them in 
the ground. It's apart of the 
game of football and I love 
it. Honestly, off the field, 
I'm just a nice guy who 
happens to be a lot bigger 

than most,” he said.
A lot of Malloy’s strength 
and kindness is a reflection 
of how he was raised. “My 
mom is a preschool teacher 
at our local church. She’s 
the reason I’m so nice. 
All of my friends at home 
always call her a saint just 
because she’s so genuine,” 
Malloy said.  
Malloy’s father was a 
paramedic in New York 
City before becoming a 
police officer. “Growing up 
he taught me to be strong 
and to really just go out 
and accomplish things. He 
is one of the main reasons 
I'm where I am today. He 
enjoys coming to my games 
more than anyone I know,” 
Malloy said. 
Malloy’s kindness isn’t to 
undermine how hard what 
he does every day is and 
how seriously he takes his 
sport and education. “A lot 
of people don’t understand 
the challenge of playing 
Division 1 football, but it 
really is like a full time job,” 
he said. 
His dream is to play 
professional football one 
day, but he understands how 
difficult it is going to be to 
get there.  “Making it to the 
NFL is one of the hardest 
things to do so everyone 
has a backup plan. Mine has 
always been to become a 
police officer just like my 
father and his father before 
him. Just being able to help 
people is what I want to do,” 
Malloy said.

After the temperature dipped 
into the 30s for a late 8 p.m. start, 
the University at Albany men’s 
soccer team kept warm by secur-
ing a clean win of 2-1 against Uni-
versity of Massachusetts Lowell 
Saturday night at Bob Ford Field 
at Casey Stadium. 

The Great Danes proved their 
preparation and desire to win early 
on after senior Phillip Persson 
scored the first goal of the night 
just three minutes into the first 
half. 
Heavy excitement within the 
first few minutes quickly wore off, 
however, as the game fell into a 
steady pace as UAlbany (7-6-1, 

2-2-0 America East) maintained 
almost full possession of the ball 
while UMass Lowell (7-6-0, 2-2-0 
AE) struggled to enter to the Great 
Danes 18-yard box. 
With few shots on net by either 
team during the remaining min-
utes, the first half concluded with 
a stagnant, but dominating force 
from the Great Danes.           

“We started the game strong 
and dominated the first half and 
into the second,” UAlbany Head 
Coach Trevor Gorman said. “We 
imposed ourselves on our op-
ponents and made it difficult for 
them to make it out of their own 
end.”         
The Great Danes kicked off the 
second half with the same energy 

that allowed them to occupy the 
ball, giving little opportunity for 
UMass to make any progress. 
Through concise passing at a 
fast pace while moving the ball 
around the entire field, UAlbany 
kept their opponent working hard 
by forcing them to strictly play

UAlbany women’s soccer rookie-of-
the-year Vivian Vega has put her season 
here at Albany on hold to join the Mexican 
U20 National Team in CAR Centro de Alto 
Rendimiento in Tijuana, Mexico. Vega was 
invited to practice and tryout for the team 
in preparation for the 2015 CONCACAF 
Women’s U20 Championship in 
December.
Vega is leading the UAlbany women’s 
team with six goals on the season. She is 
the primary scorer for the Danes, tallying 
up 22 points her freshman year and well on 
her way this year. 
Vega heard the news from her mother, 

Susana Vega, who initially got the call 
from the Mexican Soccer Federation. The 
news was kept quiet until Vega made the 
decision to go through with the tryout.  
“I was really excited when I got the 
call and soon after I started feeling a little 
nervous and worrisome because I was 
going to miss some of my college game,” 
Vega said. The Great Danes and Head 
Coach Caitlin Cucchiella stand by Vega’s 
decision, although they will miss her 
finding the back of the net for them.
“I am so excited and happy for the 
opportunity that Vivian has been provided. 
This is the highest honor that a soccer 
player can receive from their country. I 
wish her the best of luck and I am grateful 

to have her representing not only Mexico, 
but our women’s soccer program and the 
University at Albany,” Cucchiella said.
Vega was part of Cucchiella’s first 
recruiting class and came to Albany from 
Santa Ana, Calif. Vega’s national team 
debut started at the U17 level, making her 
the first UAlbany women’s soccer player to 
ever play at the national level. 
“I feel the most prepared this time 
around because I feel I’m at my highest 
level right now,” Vega said.
Vega will return home for a couple days 
before packing up to train from Oct. 19 
through Oct. 23. If Vega makes the final 
roster she will compete with the Mexican 
National Team in Honduras starting Dec. 3.  

“I’m excited about getting the 
opportunity to represent the Mexican 
National Team and making my family 
proud. I’m nervous about going to a team 
I’m not familiar with,” Vega said.
The Danes will have to push through the 
remainder of the season without Vega. Best 
case scenario: she makes it and is back to 
join her team come playoffs.
The UAlbany women’s soccer team is 
6-8-1 overall, and 1-3-1 in the America 
East Conference. Team Captain Alexa 
Schneider said the team couldn’t be happier 
for Vega. “The team is very excited for 
Vivian. Obviously we are going to miss her 
but this is an amazing opportunity and well 
earned,” Schneider said.

The University at Albany football 
team was manhandled on Saturday by 
the #25 ranked Villanova Wildcats 37-
0. The Great Danes, who were playing 
host to CAA rival Villanova for the 
first time in program history, were 
rarely competitive in the game.  
The Great Danes lost their third 
game in a row, scoring just one touch-
down in their last three games, with 
two of the losses being shutouts.
Coach Greg Gattuso was visibly 
unhappy with himself and his coach-
ing staff after the Great Danes’ second 

home loss in as many weeks.  
“I have to coach my coaches better 
and they need to coach our players 
better,” Gattuso said. “We really need 
this off week. I have a lot of thinking 
to do.” 
The Great Danes have off this week 
and after the way they have played the 
past couple of weeks, it’s not coming 
a moment too soon. UAlbany has lost 
three games in a row by a combined 
score of 113-7. 
The Wildcats pounced early on the 
porous UAlbany defense, which ranks 
10th out of 12 teams in the CAA. 
Quarterback Zach Bednarczyk led 

the Wildcats downfield on their first 
possession, with a pair of first down 
tosses to Anthony DeCamillo and 
Kevin Gulyas of 17 yards and 10 yards 
respectively. 
Gulyas had a 106 yard, 2 touch-
down game last year during UAlba-
ny’s first ever game against Villanova, 
and he had another big game with 77 
yards and a touchdown.  
Gudzak scored the first touchdown 
of the game with a 10 yard run to put 
Villanova up 7-0 with 11:11 left to go 
in the first quarter.

Basketball season is just 
around the corner and the 
University at Albany men’s 
team is already preparing to 
defend their America East 
championship. The first 
chance for fans to see the 
new team was at the Purple 
& Gold scrimmage on Sat-
urday, Oct. 17. 
Despite the cold weather 
after the UAlbany foot-
ball game, fans gathered 
together to watch at 
SEFCU Arena, where Peter 
Hooley’s buzzer beating 
three-pointer gave UAlbany 
a championship in their last 
game in the arena. 
“I think we are going 
to be very successful. We 
have a lot of good talent 
and it’s a new group. We 
are very excited. I think [the 
4th title] is within reach,” 
Hooley said. 
Hooley, from Adelaide, 
Australia, is the returning 
star who made history at 
last season’s America East 
Championship game after 
making the winning shot 
with 1.6 seconds left in the 
game. 
He recently graduated 
with a bachelor’s degree in 
both journalism and psy-
chology, earning the Reggie 
Lewis Most Outstand-
ing Player honors for the 
second time and receiving 
the 2015 SUNY Chancel-
lor’s Award for Student 
Excellence Recipient. He 
is currently enrolled in the 
master’s program for com-
munications at UAlbany for 
his final season.

Also returning this 
season are Dallas Ennema, 
Greig Stire, Ray Sanders, 
Evan Singletary, Richard 
Peters, and Mike Rowley. 
“They did a fantastic job 
tonight. I like being on the 
team,” JP Honsinger said.  
Honsinger, a seventh 
grader, has childhood Al-
zheimer’s. He loves sports 
and was brought onto the 
team as a point guard last 
November after signing a 
National Letter of Intent 
with the UAlbany men’s 
basketball team. His mother 
and friend Riley Wisdowski 
watched the game with him.
“I’m excited for the sea-
son. We got a really great 
group of guys and we are 
looking forward in getting 
after it. Practices have been 
going well, workouts and 
everything,” freshman Joe 
Cremo said. 
Cremo is one of three 
new players on the team. 
He was a three-year team 
captain MVP from Scotia-
Glenville High School, 
where he led the Tartans to 
an overall record of 92-7 
over four years, averaging 
22.0 points, 11.5 rebounds, 
4.5 assists and 3.5 steals per 
game. 
“To be honest with you, 
we practiced this morning 
a couple hours so my main 
goal was for these guys 
to get up and down to get 
some conditioning,” Head 
Coach Will Brown said. 
“I thought they all showed 
flashes. This is really for 
our season ticket holders 
and our fans but I think 
each guy did something 
well.”
