#talkedmealplans during a live 
Twitter chat on April 21 that 
started at noon. 
   Using the hashtag 
#talkmealplans, staff from UAS 
and students on Twitter talked 
about the incoming changes, 
which are due to construction, 
and what new venues are going 
to be available to students next 
year. 
   Michelle Bowen, UAS’s 
senior director of Marketing 
and Communications, came up 
with the idea. Stephen Pearse, 
the executive director of UAS, 
said that Bowen ran the Twitter 
account, @UASAlbany, during 

the chat and discussed how to 
answer with Pearse.
   While UAS has open forums 
with the Albany Student 
Dining Advisory Council to do 
essentially the same thing, it 
gets “limited success from that,” 
Pearse said. 
   “Michelle thought that this 
might be one more (fun) way to 
get some dialogue going,” he 
wrote in an email. 
   Pearse also said that UAS will 
continue to do chats like this in 
the future if it continued to get a 
good response from students.  
   “This seems to be a very 
comfortable way for students 
to reach out and ask questions, 
share concerns, [and more],” he 
said.

The ins and outs of  NYSUNY2020

NYSUNY 2020
  The University at Albany re-
ceived $35 million over a period 
of five years to enact a strategic 
plan to improve the school. 
UAlbany has reported on what 
the NYSUNY 2020 grants have 
allowed them to accomplish so 
far. 
  The NYSUNY 2020 Challenge 
Grant Program is a partnership 
established in 2011 between the 
State University of New York 
and the Office of the Governor. 
SUNY schools propose projects 
that would be beneficial to the 
university, and the Office decides 
if they should receive grants, and 
if so, for how much. 

Tuition
   Part of the program is the 
rational tuition plan, which gives 
the SUNY Board of Trustees the 
ability to vote on whether or not 
to increase tuition by $300 at all 
SUNY schools each year without 
seeking the approval of the Leg-
islature. The Board has voted to 
increase tuition for all five years 
the plan has been in place.
   James Van Voorst, vice presi-
dent for Finance and Administra-
tion at UAlbany, said the first 
thing he looks for in the budget 
is approval for the tuition appro-
priation, meaning that UAlbany 
is allowed to spend the extra 
money it earned from tuition 
increases. 
   He said this plan helps SUNY 
schools plan their budgets ahead 
of time without the need for large 
tuition hikes, and allows parents 
and students to plan ahead. 
   “It lets us say, ‘Let’s draw a 
line and say that’s where we’re 
going to start,’” he said. “I’d use 
‘predictable’ rather than ‘ratio-
nal.’”

   When legislators began cutting 
SUNY funding from the state 
budget around 2007, times be-
came more difficult, Van Voorst 
said. The solution to this problem 
was the NYSUNY 2020 plan.
   From 2007 to 2010, tuition 
increased by $620, $4,350 to 
$4,970, according to informa-
tion from UAlbany’s Common 
Data Set. From 2010 until 2013, 
it increased by $600, $4,970 to 
$5,570.
   Compared to other state school 
systems, though, SUNY is easier 
on student’s wallets. The state 
college systems of Texas, Cali-
fornia, Ohio, Virginia, Massachu-
setts, Michigan, and Pennsylva-
nia all charge higher tuition and 
fees than SUNY. Van Voorst said, 
from a “CFO’s” perspective, he 
would prefer to be on the other 
end of the spectrum and have 
more money for campus expen-
ditures. 

Performance-based funding
   The second part of the budget 
is performance-based funding, 
which applies SUNY-wide and is 
different for each campus. 
   This lets SUNY schools prove 
that, “with a little bit of invest-
ment, I can do better,” Van 
Voorst said.
   There are some who argue 
against performance-based fund-
ing. When the ASP reported on 
SUNY’s announcement of the 
new SUNY Excels program, 
which uses performance-based 
funding to increase graduation 
rates, Fred Kowal, president of 
the SUNY UUP, expressed his 
doubt. 
   “Research shows the goals 
of graduating more students, 
improving student success, and 
getting them into the work-
force are not achieved by these 
performance-based funding 
mechanisms,” he said.
   Van Voorst accepted this cri-

tique, but said there are ways to 
avoid it.
   “The key is going to be that 
it doesn’t become a numbers 
game,” he said. “That’s one of 
the things we’d have to watch.”
   SUNY Chancellor Nancy 
Zimpher is hoping that many of 
improvements gained through 
performance-based funding and 
measurement are scalable and 
could be used to all campuses, 
Sheila Seery, associate vice pres-
ident of government relations in 
the Office of the President, said. 

UAlbany’s spending
   So far, UAlbany has spent 
money from NYSUNY 2020 
on campus construction, to hire 
teachers, give out more student 
aid, and to increase university 
research.
   UAlbany has hired 160 full-
time faculty members with the 
goal of improving the student-to-
faculty ratio. The current ratio is 
18.2 teachers for every student, 
according to UAlbany’s Com-
mon Data Set, down by about 
1.62 percent from the 18.5-to-1 
of fall 2011.
   A portion of the money will 
also go toward supporting faculty 
with supplies, money for travel, 
or assistants. This will also be 
available to adjunct and part-time 
faculty, Van Voorst said. 
   UAlbany has also put 17 per-
cent of the money from tuition 
increases toward Tuition Assis-
tance Program (TAP) aid, schol-
arships, and stipends for student 
research. So far, 71 percent of the 
tuition revenue has gone towards 
the faculty and student aid lines, 
according to Van Voorst.
   “I think we’re holding up our 
commitment,” he said.
   UAlbany has also created or 
expanded 29 programs, added 
153 more course sections, 
increased the number of com-
panies recruiting on campus by

   The University at Albany is 
teaming up with Albany Medical 
Center to create and deliver 200 
comfort kits, coined “survival 
kits,” to victims who have gone 
through forensic testing after be-
ing sexually assaulted. 
   The project, titled “We Care,” 
will consist of individual pack-
ages that contain small comforts, 
including clothing, toiletries, 
journals, hairbrushes, personal 
notes from the packers to the 
victims, and teddy bears. 
   Volunteers will make the pack-
ages, which will then be deliv-
ered to Albany Medical Center 
by the Five Quad Ambulance 
service and Albany County EMS.
   “The We Care project, planned 
to heighten awareness of 
April's Sexual Assault Aware-
ness Month, was supported by 
Albany Medical Center and the 
University at Albany with the 
support of community partners 
Rite Aid, Walmart, W.B. Mason, 
and CVS,” according to a press 
release.
   The optional forensic examina-
tion is commonly referred to as a 
rape kit, and is used by investiga-

tors to collect any DNA samples 
that may lead them to finding the 
perpetrator. The examinations are 
performed by medical profes-
sionals who have been specially 
trained, but the process can be 
invasive for a victim.
   “Victims are now allowed 
more time to decide whether to 
pursue their case, a decision that 
can be difficult to make at the 
time of the attack,” according to 
the website for the Rape, Abuse, 
and Incest National Network 
(RAINN). However, the statute 
of limitations for reporting a 
sexual assault varies from state 
to state, and waiting to report a 
case or receive an examination 
might lower the chances of ap-
prehending the perpetrator.
   In an effort to increase sexual 
assault prevention and awareness 
on campus, UAlbany instituted 
its own Advocacy Center for 
Sexual Violence on Jan. 22, 
2014. Before the Advocacy 
Center, UAlbany offered support 
for sexual assault through the 
Counseling Center. 
   The Advocacy Center spe-
cifically provides victims of 
sexual assault with a safe place 
to receive support and guidance, 
whether they received the foren-
sic examination or not. 

   The point of the Advocacy 
Center, according to Director 
Carol Stenger, is to give victims 
a place where they can feel like 
they’re safe and at home, as op-
posed to being in a doctor’s of-
fice. It provides protocol training 
for all students and faculty who 
want to become a confidant for 
victims, and has other programs 
as well, including assistance in 
dealing with STD diagnoses. 
   The Advocacy Center also en-
courages sexual assault victims 
to report the incident in any way 
that they feel comfortable and 
provides multiple ways to do so, 
including reporting it confiden-
tially, or reporting it to other 
university personnel. 
   “Especially in the case of 
sexual assault, but even in inter-
personal violence to a large de-
gree, all of your control is taken 
away,” Stenger said before to the 
ASP. “I want to put the control 
back in that person right away. 
These are all your choices, these 
are all your decisions.”
   The Advocacy Center for 
Sexual Violence can be reached 
at (518) 442-CARE.

   Graduation can create feelings 
of excitement and accomplish-
ment. Along with these positive 
feelings, you may also experi-
ence stress about your future and 
apprehension about change. 
   Those of you 
who are plan-
ning to graduate 
this semester 
are probably 
pursuing many 
different and 
unique paths. 
Some of you may 
be heading to 
further your edu-
cation through 
studying law, 
business, medi-
cine, psychol-
ogy, or another 
discipline. Others 
may already 
have a job lined 
up. Some of you 
may plan on 
continuing your 
education after 
gaining some 
work experience. 
And a large num-
ber of you will 
be looking for a 
job after moving 
back home. 
   In spite of the 
range of pos-
sibilities, you all 
have one thing 
in common - 
change. Change 
can affect several 
areas of a per-
son’s life. 
   But there are some ways you 
can deal with all this change.
   First, be aware that “good 
stress” is still stress. Enjoy the 
positive, natural high that you 
get from good stress, but also be 
aware of the toll it may be taking 
on your body and your mind.

   Second, check in with yourself 
once in a while and try to figure 
out what you are thinking and 
feeling.
   Third, take care of yourself 
physically by eating well and 
getting enough sleep and exer-
cise. Take steps to balance work, 
social activities, and relaxation.
   And fourth, keep an eye out 
for signs of stress - a change in 

your temperament, a change in 
sleeping patterns, or a change in 
eating habits. These signs may 
indicate that you need to find 
more ways to help yourself cope 
with the new changes in your 
life.
   Be aware that the transition 
from college to graduate school 
or the professional world may 

not be completely smooth. The 
lifestyle you have grown ac-
customed to as an undergraduate 
will be disrupted, and you will

   Joan Murray and Alicia Suskin 
Ostriker may not be crazy, but 
they do hear voices.
   The two women who visited 
the University at Albany on 
Thursday, April 23 as part of a 
New York State Writers Institute 
event, are poets. Both mentioned 
hearing the voices of their char-
acters.
   “I have to really listen,” Mur-
ray said.
   When she feels as though a 
character is speaking to her, she 
writes down what she hears. 
The poets explained that they 
believe it is their responsibility to 
share what is being told to them 
by characters they may create. 

   “We can get something said in 
lots of different ways but it's our 
obligation as poets to write it in 
the voice that was given to us,” 
Murray said. 
   However, the poets agreed that 
they face subjects that are dif-

ficult to share in their 
personal voices.
   “Usually when I get 
stuck with something 
it’s because I am trying 
to capture something 
in my net of language,” 
Ostriker said.
   For a poet, listening 
to voices they may 
hear is easy. Those 
voices tell stories. Us-
ing their own voices 
to tell the stories is 
harder. 
   Murray offered some 
advice to aspiring po-
ets trying to find their 
own voice.
   “Read poetry,” she 
said. “It can be so 
completely different but they’re 
all ways to hear what your voice 
is as a poet.”
   With countless different types 
of poetry, reading it can seem 
daunting. 
   Ostriker began writing poetry 
by counting syllables and lines 
before a friend of hers told her 
she wrote like she was stuck in 
the past.
   “You don’t write like you’re in 
the 20th century,” she recalled 
him saying. 
   From then on, she began 
writing free verse more consis-
tently. However, she never again 
referred to it as that name.
   “It’s open form,” she said. “It’s 
like improvisation.”
   Ostriker admitted that, in this 
sense, poetry is similar to jazz 
music. While there is an ele-
ment of music in her writing, she 
explains that there is a story as 
well.
   “Human beings love stories, 
human beings love narrative,” 
she said.
   The two poets agreed that 
poetry is not just song and not 

just story.
   “We’re making art here,” Mur-
ray said. 
   Poetry is made up of countless 
different pieces. 
   “When you write from your 
own depths,” Ostriker said, “If 
you find the language, if you find 
the music, if you find what trans-
lates the nonverbal stuff in you 
into language, then it will come 
across to other people.”
   While finding a topic to write 
about can be difficult, the poets 
agreed that it is something that 
comes from their own minds. 
   “What a poet does do if they 
want to be really powerful is pur-
sue his or her own obsessions,” 
Ostriker said. “Whatever you 
can’t stop yourself from brood-
ing about, that’s your subject.”
   Ostriker’s most recent book, 
entitled “The Old Woman, the 
Tulip, and the Dog” was released 
last year. Murray’s latest collec-
tion, “Swimming for the Ark: 
New & Selected Poems 1990-
2015” was published this year.

24 percent, and aims to improve 
the graduation rate. According to 
the Common Data Set, the six-
year graduation rate for the 2008 
class was 66 percent; for the 
2007 class, it was 66.4 percent; 
and for the 2006 class, it was 
62.6 percent. 
   The increase in grant and 
tuition revenue has also given 
UAlbany administration the abil-
ity to plan for the future more ac-
tively, rather than just “reacting.” 
Administration does not have to 
make “mid-year adjustments” as 
much anymore, Van Voorst said.

   “We were having conversations 
two years ago about next year,” 
he said, because administrators 
knew that the tuition plan was 
in place if state aid did not come 
through.
   Another benefit, according to 
Van Voorst, is that 83 percent of 
graduates are working in New 
York State after college. 
   
The final year
   “Part of this compact is we 
need to show how we use that 
money,” Van Voorst said. 
   All SUNY schools will present 
their results when the NYSUNY 

2020 legislation comes to an end 
after the 2015-16 academic year. 
The state will have to decide 
whether or not to renew the plan 
and offer more funding.
   “How efficiently and how ef-
fectively do the schools use those 
dollars? That’s what it comes 
down to,” Van Voorst said. 
   He said that UAlbany is try-
ing to hold its standards high 
with the money it received. He 
is uneasy about what the future 
would hold if NYSUNY 2020 is 
not extended.

OPiniOnS

 The 2016 
Presidential Elec-
tions are more 
than a year away, 
yet the speculations have already begun. On the 
Republican side, we have a large pool of potential 
candidates. Three of them (Ted Cruz, Rand Paul, 
and Marco Rubio) have already announced their 
candidacy, with many more planning to announce 
and forming exploratory committees.
   On the Democratic side, the field is less crowded. 
On the surface, there is one person who will run: 
Hillary Clinton. She is the only one that has an-
nounced so far. Despite possible options such as 
Vice President Joe Biden and Senator Elizabeth 
Warren, it is looking to be a coronation for the 
former First Lady.
   On paper, Clinton looks to be the best candidate 
the Democrats can offer up. Clinton is doing very 
well in polls for primary and general elections. 
According to Real Clear Politics (RCP), Clinton 
is 50 points ahead of any Democratic challenger. 
In general election polls, she beats all Republican 
challengers. The closest challenge, according to 
RCP, is from Marco Rubio, and she beats him by 
7.5 points.
   Clinton has a few qualities that set her apart from 
her challengers. Her biggest asset is the politi-
cal dynasty she forged with her husband, former 
President Bill Clinton. This empire has produced 
millions of dollars and political connections across 
the country. These connections led to her next 
asset: experience. As a former first lady, Clinton 
began eight years of seeing the inner workings 
of the White House. She later became a senator 
in New York, where she gained experience in the 
legislature. She later became Secretary of State 
under President Barack Obama, where she gained 
experienced in foreign affairs. This mix of dealing 

with domestic and foreign issues makes Clinton a 
good candidate. 
   On top of all of this, her gender is powerful as 
well. Its benefits are two-fold. Firstly, she could be 
the first female president. This status could drive 
people to the polls to vote for her. The secondary 
use is the shield from any or all attacks against her. 
Just like any critic of President Obama is spun as a 
“racist,” anyone who criticizes Clinton, no matter 
how legitimate the criticism may be, will be painted 
a “sexist.” The “war on women” portrayal has 
worked for Democrats in the past, and may very 
well work for them in 2016. 
   The obvious media support of Clinton may help 
her win the election. Two scandals have recently 
come out that would destroy any Republican in a 
media firestorm. First, Clinton operated out of a 
private email instead of a government email during 
her tenure. This is bad because these emails are 
not on record with the government. In the case that 
these emails needed to be checked or referenced, 
there would be no official record of them. The other 
big scandal was the massive amounts of foreign 
money donated to the Clinton Foundation, a charity 

run by the Clintons. By itself, it may seem mini-
mal. However, tracing back the donations, several 
decisions by Clinton as Secretary of State are called 
into question, such as a Russian nuclear energy 
company, Rosatom, buying a Canadian uranium 
company. Clinton signed off the sale and millions 
of dollars from high ranking employees of Rosatom 
have flooded the Clinton Foundation. Despite these 
troubling stories, the media saved their ferocity, 
initiative, and outrage for much more “impor-
tant” scandals. Such “scandals” ranged from Scott 
Walker not graduating college to Chris Christie 
possibly closing down lanes on the George Wash-
ington Bridge. The news media loves Clinton and 
they are shamelessly not afraid to show it.
   Unfortunately, there are some downsides to 
Clinton beyond those two scandals. Her experi-
ence while in government has been less than stellar. 
As First Lady, Clinton led the committee to push 
her husband’s healthcare reform plan. The plan 
was under fire from the right as well as the health 
insurance agency, and she was tasked with selling 
it to the American public. The task force ultimately 
failed and the plan was never passed. In Congress, 
despite her service, she voted for both wars in Af-
ghanistan and Iraq. Both of those votes came back 
to haunt her in the 2008 election, where she had to 
defend her vote to a party who disliked the wars. 
The entire 2008 election is pretty much an embar-
rassment to Clinton in general. 
   Going into the primaries, Clinton was seen as 
the inevitable candidate to win the Presidency. At 
first, Clinton was the leader in the polls. After a few 
terrible performances in debates, her numbers fell 
as Obama’s number’s rose. What once looked like 
a shoe-in turned out to be a major defeat. After the 
victory of Obama in 2008, she was appointed to be 
his Secretary of State, she accepted. Even without 
the faux Benghazi controversy, Clinton’s tenure as 

Secretary of State was far from stellar. Much of her 
tenure is unremarkable. Russian relations, despite 
her efforts, are no better than they were before her 
appointment. Despite her years of experience, she 
has very little to point to in those years to be proud 
of. At best, she was unexceptional at everything she 
did.
   Despite these flaws, her odds of winning the 
presidency are very good. While it is still very 
early, Clinton is showing an impressive start to the 
2016 campaign. Let’s see if she can finish the job 
this time.

#ReadyForHillary again?

“Shut the fuck up!” 
   I heard a student scream from 
the third floor of an Indian Quad 
dorm. It was a Sunday morn-
ing at 11 A.M., and I was in the 
middle of my second campus 
tour of the day. 
   As a tour guide, I recognize 
that the explosively loud voices 
of my 20 coworkers and myself 
can sometimes be intrusive in the 
early hours of a weekend morn-
ing. However, this was not a 
typical Sunday afternoon. It was 
Open House for accepted stu-
dents at the University at Albany. 
This was my second consecutive 
day waking up at 7 a.m., along 
with my fellow tour guides, in 
order to greet thousands of new 
students that were coming to visit 
the university. 
   The last thing I want to do is 
deprive anyone of his or her late 
afternoon sleep, when I myself 
have been awake since the crack 
of dawn. I walk backwards for 
hours throughout the campus and 
answer the same questions some-
times 15 or 20 times a day. 
   None of this ever bothers me: I 
accept it as a part of the job that 
I thoroughly enjoy and look for-
ward to doing every week. I love 
speaking about my experience at 
UAlbany, showcasing our unique 
campus and being in a position 
where I can convince others to 
attend as well. However, the part 
of my job that I refuse to accept 
is the constant encounters with 
students who feel it is acceptable 
to scream profanities or rude 
comments to the large groups of 
people who are receiving their 
first impression of the school. 
   If one is a current student, 
and has ever made a harmful 
comment to a tour group, he/
she makes our jobs increasingly 
more difficult. More importantly, 
he/she makes our university look 
bad as a whole. 
   “Don’t come here, the food 
sucks.” 
   “The TA’s here are terrible.”
   “Coming to this school was the 
worst decision of my life.”
   If my coworkers and I sat down 
to share our collective experi-
ence with the negative comments 
we receive, we would be truly 

bothered. Just know that this is 
our job, and although anyone has 
the freedom to state their com-
ments or shout their opinions, 
before one does, take a second 
to empathize with us. Especially 
to the students that are employed 
elsewhere, think about how you 
would feel if someone followed 
you around just to contradict 
everything you were trying to 
sell or promote. 
   As a tour guide, we truly be-
lieve in the product we are trying 
to sell, which is our school. We 
recognize that students can have 
bad days, and that maybe they do 
not have a great experience with 
all aspects of our campus. What 
we want people to realize is that 
they have an entire year compro-
mised of hundreds of chances to 
have a delicious lunch, for one’s 
teaching assistant to take the 
time to personally help him/her 
with an assignment, or maybe, 
one might step into the sunshine 
at Collins Circle and simply be 
grateful to be here.  However, the 
prospective students and fami-
lies that are following us around 
campus will only have one day to 
make their decision. They should 
be able to make it free from the 
influence of others.
   To those who felt it was okay 
to scream at families through 
their dorm windows, I wish they 
had realized the events that were 
going on. Sometimes, when 
thousands of people visit the 
school, it can be more important 
than that extra hour of com-
pletely peaceful sleep one can get 
on a Sunday morning. It is about 
putting aside one’s exhaustion or 
headache from the night before 
and realize that although these 
tours should be an expected part 
of campus life, they will not hap-
pen every day. In fact, other than 
last weekend, tours never happen 
on Sunday mornings on Indian 
Quad (they do happen Satur-
day mornings on State Quad at 
Fulton Hall- our sincerest apolo-
gies). 
   Open House is crucial because 
it happens to take place right 
before our Admissions Deposit 
Deadline. For many visiting 
students in the next few weeks, 
our campus tours will be the 
deciding factor in regards to at-
tending UAlbany. I ask on behalf 
of my coworkers, Supervising 

Tour Coordinator and Admis-
sions Counselors who I know 
work tirelessly to accommodate 
and interact with thousands of 
our visiting students that people 
please refrain from casually 
directing harmful comments 
at our groups. I only have one 
hour to showcase our university, 
and I would love to spend more 
time talking about our libraries, 
fountains, or resources, than do-
ing damage control because of a 
statement that was made. 
   Lastly, to anyone who intrudes 
on tours because they are truly 
unhappy with their experience at 
UAlbany, I encourage everyone 
to take advantage of the vast re-
sources the university has to of-
fer. There are over 200 clubs you 
can join, professional counselors 
you can speak too, personalized 
tutoring one can receive, or even 
just a different meal plan that 
will be more accommodating to 
your needs.
   And if one needs help, feel 
free to stop by University Hall 
and speak to a tour guide. We 
would love to help, and are more 
than willing to lend a hand when 
it comes to utilizing all of the 
resources UAlbany has to offer.

What is Autism?
   “Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a range of 
complex neurodevelopment disorders, character-
ized by social impairments, communication dif-
ficulties, and restricted, repetitive, and stereotyped 
patterns of behavior,” according to the National 
Institute of Neurological disorders and Stroke, 
which also reports that early signs of autism are 
found when babies are unresponsive to people or 
only focus on one item.
   There are also mild cases of Autism, such as 
Asperger’s syndrome where the central symptom 
is trouble in social situations, such as not picking 
up on body language or the inability to start and 
maintain conversations with other people.

How many people are diagnosed?
   One in 68 U.S. children are diagnosed with 
Autism spectrum disorder (ASD), according to 
the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention 
(CDC) in 2014. This is a 30 percent increase from 
two years ago where only one in 88 children were 
diagnosed, according to a report released by CNN 
in 2014.
   The number of people diagnosed with Autism is 
steadily increasing and the age by which parents 
start to see signs of autism and it is being diagnosed 
is decreasing. The CDC reports that the diagnosis 
of Autism by age two can be valid and reliable and 
parents begin to see signs of autism before a child’s 
first birthday. 
   “ASD is almost five 
times more common 
among boys  (one in 
42) than among girls 
(one in 189),” accord-
ing to the CDC and 
“on average, children 
identified with ASD 
were not diagnosed un-
til after age four, even 
though children can be 
diagnosed as early as 
age two.”
   
Why is Autism in-
creasing?
   The reason for the 
spike in Autism diag-
noses is in part due to 
the expanded diag-
nostic criteria for the 
illness. The Diagnostic 
and Statistical Manual 
of Mental Disorders 
(DSM) has increased 
the criteria eligibility 
for Autism. Accord-
ing to Disabilityscoop.
com, a research team at 
the University of Utah 
matched the diagno-
sis criteria in the 80s to the criteria in the modern 
day and found that “most who were deemed to be 
autism-free at that time would receive the label 
today.”
   “Thus, while it is well known that current DSM-
IV-TR criteria increased the identification of high 
functioning individuals, our results indicate that 
they also increase identification of ASD among in-
dividuals with autism and intellectual impairment,” 
wrote researchers in the study published online in 
the Journal of Autism and Developmental Disor-
ders this month.
   Researchers have also linked the increase in 
Autism to the increase in air pollution. The new 
Harvard study says that exposure to air pollution 
amongst pregnant women, more specifically in their 
third trimester, have an increased chance is birthing 
a child with Autism as reported by NBC news.
   There was also a recent study linking autism to 
the Mumps-Measles-Rubella (MMR) vaccination. 
This study has since been disproven.

Autism in Society
   People who are diagnosed with Autism are fairly 
young, most of the time before they enter school. 
For a long time, Autistic children are in the care of 
their parents or guardians.
   The economic hardships parents have to face to 
sustain a child are increased with Autism. 
   The CDC reports that, “It is estimated to cost at 
least $17,000 more per year to care for a child with 
ASD compared to a child without ASD. Costs in-
clude health care, education, ASD-related therapy, 
family-coordinated services, and caregiver time. 

For a child with more severe ASD, costs per year 
increase to over $21,000. Taken together, it is esti-
mated that total societal costs of caring for children 
with ASD were over $9 billion in 2011.”
   In this case it is far better to get a child diagnosed 
sooner rather than later. This way, the child will be 
able to get the medical attention he or she needs as 
well as learn how to better function in society while 
dealing with Autism.
   “The earlier a child is diagnosed with autism, the 
better their chances of overcoming the difficulties 
that come with the disorder,” according to CNN.

Autism in school
   First thing to know is that nearly one in three 
students report being bullied during the school year, 
according to the National Center for Educational 
statistics in 2013. 
   63 percent of children with Autism had been 
bullied, according to a survey of 1,200 parents who 
had a child with Autism conducted by researchers 
from the Kennedy Krieger Institute in Baltimore 
and Johns Hopkins University. It was also dis-
covered that these children were three times more 
likely to be bullied than their siblings who do not 
have autism.
   Other findings included: 61 percent of children 
with Asperger’s were being bullied and children in 
public schools were 50 percent more like to be bul-
lied than in private of special education schools.
   “One noteworthy finding was children with au-
tism may also become bullies themselves. Twenty 
percent of surveyed parents said their child with au-
tism had bullied others. Most were “bully-victims,” 

meaning they had also been bullied at some point, 
the researchers said.”
   Children with Autism are placed in regular 
classroom settings and their characteristic behav-
ioral traits are not in-line with non-Autistic student, 
which is indicative of their treatment from other 
students.
   
What do we do?
   The first thing to realize is that people with Au-
tism clearly need special attention. This means that 
in public schools, they need a regiment separate 
from the other students: a regiment where they can 
learn at their own pace and they are not troubled 
with constant teasing by their peers.
   People must also realize that people with any 
degree of Autism are still people.  Having Autism 
does not make anyone less of a person and those 
who tease people with autism probably have an 
Autistic person in their family and if it’s not okay 
to tease that family, then it is not okay to tease 
anyone else’s. 
   Dr. Paul Law said,“To experience teasing, taunts, 
ostracism or other forms of spite may make a child 
who was already struggling to cope become com-
pletely unable to function,” in a CBS news article.
   People need to increase awareness for those with 
Autism. It is not easy for them, their parents, or 
their family. 
   People with Autism are more importantly people 
in general and should be treated as such.

Be aware of Autism

   The college experience be-
comes a reality for most students 
once they step on campus. They 
see it on television, movies 
constantly exploit it, and students 
broadcast it on social media. 
   These cookie-cutter depictions 
of college are arbitrary because 
college is a culture shock for 
most incoming students. Think 
about it: people are always re-
flecting on what they could have 
done differently in college. 
The best way to make a smooth 
transition into college is to start 
on the right foot. 
   “You can think of college as an 
incubation period, where you de-
velop your skills and character” 
Quora user Ching Ho wrote in a 
post. “You are likely never going 
to have as many resources, like-
minded peers, free hours, and op-
portunities as you do in college 
again- so use them wisely.” 
   Each person’s experience in 
college is distinctively their own. 
It is pretty easy to dabble into 
too much or suffer from dorm 
room fever, but there are ways to 
create a medium. Students will 
definitely say that creating a bal-
ance is easier said than done, but 
this is a skill one acquires and 
develop over the course of four 
years. 
   One must manage his or her 
time. It sounds cliché, but life is 
a lot more relieving when one is 
conscious of what they can do in 
a day. Some of the common tips 
include writing down tasks, plan-
ning ahead, scheduling in time to 
relax and sleep, and the list goes 
on. The point is to set realistic 

expectations for yourself in order 
to remain satisfied and sane in 
college. 
   College is a journey for ev-
eryone, and it can get stressful. 
For instance, a picture circulated 
on Facebook a couple of years 
ago titled “Choose Two: social 
life, good grades and/or enough 
sleep.” 
   Stress comes with the territory. 
One should ease it by participat-
ing in activities that will keep 
him/her levelheaded like getting 
enough sleep, reaching out to 
others, or relieving tactics. It 
will leave someone with a more 
fulfilling experience knowing 
that he or she is able to take care 
of themself.
   Academic life in college is 
different from academic life 
in high school in that one has 
control over what courses he or 
she wants to take. Choose classes 
wisely and carefully. These are 
classes that one should enjoy and 
will help them complete their 
major or minor.  
   Succeeding academically is 
a two-way street (and some 
would say three-way street). 
Take classes with good profes-
sors. Pick their brain and see 
what they expect out of students. 
Likewise, have a helpful advisor 
that will keep one’s education in 
good standing.
   Students should avoid procras-
tination and all-nighters as much 
as possible by mapping out the 
work they have to do. I have 
heard too many horror stories 
about people staying an extra 
year or extra semester because 
they need to complete their 
credits. Schedule courses each 
semester in a way that will set 

up graduation by the time senior 
year rolls around.
   College life does not fizzle 
once people leave the classroom. 
Interact with people. It is refresh-
ing to know that students can 
leave high school in the past and 
start off with a clean slate: they 
should take advantage of it. This 
means student need to step out 
of their comfort zone and their 
dorm room. 
   There are plenty of people to 
meet in college and tons of ways 
to meet them. Eat with friends, 
talk to people in your hall, go to 
parties, attend events, take on 
internships, or study abroad.
   Most importantly, join clubs 
and organizations. They put 
blocks in peoples’ time for things 
that they are interested in. Orga-
nizational sociologist Daniel F. 
Chambliss at Hamilton College 
made a similar point in a New 
York Times piece.
   “Most people don’t make their 
friends in classes. It helps to join 
a large high-contact activity, like 
a sports team or choir, where 
people see each other at least 
twice a week.” 
   The list of clubs on campus 
that one can join is endless, 
plus one’s chances of finding 
more than one organization that 
matches their interests are pretty 
high. 
   Remember that students have 
four years to figure college out. 
The sooner they start, the better. 
It comes down to dedication and 
patience, which are probably the 
last two words that students want 
to hear, but will help guide them 
in the right direction towards a 
fulfilling college experience.

Understanding the 
college experience

   Classes are set in stone, but 
the way students spend the rest 
of their time in college is for 
them to decide. Use that time 
to participate in extracurricular 
activities.
   “The most basic reason for 
joining a club or team is that it 
gives you something better to 
do than staring at a wall, wan-
dering the hall, or napping all 
afternoon,” TeensHealth.com 
saod. Having an abundance of 
open time is a reality for most 
students, but clubs and various 
activities can and will fill those 
empty holes in their schedule.
   Extracurricular activities 
provide students a break from 
the academic setting. Students 
should remember that college 
is not solely about doing well. 
Instead of perceiving activities as 
a pastime from academics, view 
it as something that compliments 
academics. 
   “The things you do in your free 
time reveal a lot about you in 
ways that grades and test scores 
can’t,” Jeff Brenzel, the dean of 
undergraduate admissions at Yale 
University, claimed. 
   Realistically, students are not 
studying for the entire day. That 
does not mean that academics 
are insignificant, but college life 
encompasses more than school-
work. 

   The types of activities that indi-
viduals can enroll at the Univer-
sity at Albany in are endless. Ac-
cording to MyInvolvement.org, 
activities on campus fall under 
twelve categories: academic, arts, 
cultural, fraternity or sorority, 
media, political, pre-professional, 
recreation, religious, service, 
social, and university resources.
   They key to getting involved is 
finding activities that pertain to 
the interests and goals are for a 
student. The point is for students 
to expand, not confine, their 
horizons because extracurricular 
activities help them gain more 
exposure to what college has to 
offer them.
   This type of fulfillment is not 
only analogous to joining clubs 
and organizations. Internships 
and part time jobs are a satisfy-
ing way to gain work experience, 
professional skills, and compen-
sation at the same time. Resident 
Assistants [RAs] serve as the go-
to people for residents living on 
campus, and they receive perks 
like recognition and free room 
and board. Sports help people 
stay in shape in a recreational 
manner.
   Choose wisely. The amount of 
activities students take on is a 
personal decision, but their ac-
tivities should be something that 
they enjoy and help them reach 
their full potential.  
   “Establishing yourself in a 
few activities that you truly care 

about and where you are able to 
enlist yourself in a leadership 
role says that you have the abil-
ity to commit to a task and take 
charge of it,” Carolyn Cutrone 
and Melissa Stanger from Busi-
ness Insider said.
   Getting involved is also a way 
for students to be productive 
in college because they are in 
a new and unfamiliar environ-
ment. They might feel hesitant 
to become active out of fear and 
uncertainty of putting themselves 
out there, but taking the first step 
is worth it. That step will give 
students an immense amount of 
exposure to opportunities that 
help them get more familiar with 
their surroundings.
   They are forced to break out 
of their comfort zone and get in-
volved by leaving their room and 
resisting the urge to only hanging 
out with people in proximity to 
them.  Extracurricular activities 
ultimately make students feel 
more in touch with themselves 
and their college experience.
   “[The important thing is] are 
you getting something out of 
it?” Brenzel asked. “Are you 
enjoying it? Are you learning 
how to do it better? Has it taken 
you some places that you would 
not otherwise have gone? If so, 
you’re fine.”

They Might Be Giants rock the Capital Region

   Having just released a new album on 
April 21, They Might Be Giants has 
begun touring all around the country. 
On their tour, the band stopped by the 
Capital District on Wednesday, April 22 for an energetic and eclectic 
performance at Upstate Concert Hall in Clifton Park. The alterna-
tive rock band played a mix of songs both old and new, but mainly 
focused on their new album “Glean.”
   The band is on a very difficult touring schedule, which involves 
touring cities from Philadelphia to San Diego in support of their 17th 
album. They will then travel back to Brooklyn for the last Sunday of 
every month to play a hometown show. 
   Having formed in 1982, the band has a mix of fans from all gen-
erations. The audience at Upstate Concert Hall consisted of all ages, 
from high schoolers to their parents’ generation. The venue does not 
offer a lot of space for dancing, but jumping up and down seemed to 
be enough for most. 
   

The band certainly let their weird 
sense of humor shine through during 
their set. They fielded a pair of fake 
phone calls from Siri, Apple’s digital 
assistant program. Singer/guitarist 
John Flansburgh turned his back to 
the audience and used a robotic voice 
effect on his microphone to make the 
“prank calls” to singer/keyboardist 
John Linnell. 
   During the second set, Flansburgh 
admitted to the crowd that calling 
Upstate Concert Hall an Albany 
venue is a bit misleading.
   “I honestly have no idea where we 
are,” said Flansburgh. The band later 
thanked “Mr. Cliff Ton Park, our 
benefactor,” for bringing them there.
   TMBG played a few fan favorites 
such as “Istanbul” and “Birdhouse in 
Your Soul,” but made some surpris-
ing omissions. Despite bringing up 
former Governor Nelson Rockefeller 
several times, and explicitly stating 
that they would play the song, they 
did not play their tribute to Albany’s 
roundest landmark “The Egg.” 
Popular singles from the band such 
as “Ana Ng” and “Don’t Let’s Start” 
were also left out of the set list.
   Leaving out some older material 
certainly helped them make the case 
for their newest album, which was 
available for purchase at their mer-
chandise table. New songs like “Underwater Woman” and “Answer” 
were received just as well as older material from the band. 
   After a pair of one hour sets and two encores, the band said their 
goodbyes by giving out hundreds of band stickers to the audience. 
The stage techs began taking everything apart, so that the equipment 
could be loaded and taken to their next stop at the House of Blues in 
Boston.
   The Brooklyn-based band found an early audience through their 
Dial-A-Song method of recording songs. The phone service, oper-
ated by John Linnell and John Flansburgh, originally ran from 1983 
to 2006. New songs would be recorded on a voicemail, which fans 

could call in order to hear new music. 
   TMBG brought back Dial-A-Song for 2015, as well as a website 
for hearing their new material. The songs are updated every week, 
which will mean 52 brand new songs planned for the year. The num-
ber for Dial-A-Song is (844) 387-6962.
   With the release of their new album, revival of the Dial-A-Song 
service, and successful national tour, They Might Be Giants is back 
bigger than ever.
 

Hollywood preps for summer with a rush of trailers

   The summer movie season is looming 
ever closer, and with “Avenger: Age 
of Ultron” set to kick things off on 
May 1, studios have recently been in a 
rush to release shiny new trailers for their biggest blockbusters in the 
hopes of playing in front of one of the largest audiences of the year.  
“Star Wars: The Force Awakens,” Disney’s other gigantic, pop-cul-
ture-dominating sequel in 2015, recently debuted its second trailer to 
an ecstatic fan response on April 16, but the days following that also 
saw new trailers for just about all of summer 2015’s heavyweight 
contenders, and one from a release as far off as 2016.  Here now is 
a look at some of these new trailers and what they reveal about the 
films themselves.
   “Ant-Man,” Marvel Studios’ emphatically small “Age of Ultron” 
follow-up got its second trailer, revealing more of the plot and char-
acters and also addressing the complaints many had with the first 
trailer.  This new look at the smallest Avenger’s debut film played 
up the humor, an element that was mostly lacking from earlier looks 
at the film, and the result was a much clearer vision of the action-
comedy tone that all involved promised the film would have. One 
stand-out comedic sequence in the trailer saw a beyond-bite-sized 

Ant-Man (Paul Rudd) going at it with 
a similarly small villain on a rattling 
train, which turns out to be a child’s 
Thomas the Tank Engine playset. The 
trailer also offered the first look at the 
film’s main antagonist, Yellowjacket 
(Corey Stoll) in motion, and provided 
a better impression of what the world 
will look like from the hero’s point-of-
view when small. All in all, it was a 
very promising look at what is shaping 
up to be a solid adventure
   On a less promising note, 
“Terminator: Genisys,” the franchise 
reboot that everyone seems to have 
accepted despite never having asked 
for it, dropped a new trailer that left 
fans and pundits scratching their 
heads. The usual business was there: 
alternate timeline, Emilia Clarke 
in badass-mode, bus chase, Arnold 
Schwarzenegger back in the cyber-
netic-saddle. But in addition to all 
that was a reveal that seemed to give 
away a massive and game-changing 
twist. In the interest of those wishing 
to remain unspoiled this twist will 
not be shared here, but suffice it to 
say that something is definitely not 
what it seemed to be, and the implica-
tions of this for the franchise past 
and present will almost certainly 
be huge, if not necessarily good or 
well thought out. Nothing else in the 
trailer indicated that the film would 
be anything more than a generic action flick, but it will certainly not 
be without some intrigue.
   The new trailer for “Fantastic Four” had perhaps the most heavy-
lifting to do as the film is such a huge departure from both the 
previous FF movies and most superhero films in general, and the 
previous trailer for the film left a lot to be desired in terms of char-
acter and detail.  To its credit, the second trailer gives a much better 
sense of who the titular team are as characters, showed how they 
will interact with each other, and for good measure threw in some 
humor. On top of all that, the extra time needed to finish up the 
visual effects allowed the new trailer to show off each character’s 
powers in action. Less interesting was the first look at the film’s 
new, weirdly-shiny version of Doctor Doom.  While the market-
ing for the film is finally starting to give a fuller idea of what it 
is, whether or not such a grounded take on a traditionally big and 
vibrant team of characters like the Fantastic Four is a good idea 
remains to be seen.
   Strangely enough, easily the biggest trailer unveiled recently was 
not for a film coming out this summer, or even this year. The debut 
teaser for “Batman v. Superman: Dawn of Justice,” the follow-up to 
2013’s “Man of Steel” and precursor to the rest of the DC Comics 
Cinematic Universe, dropped in advance of summer 2015, despite 
the fact that the film itself will not be in theaters until March 25, 
2016. When the fate of an entire line of giant blockbusters depends 
on one film making a billion dollars, maybe it makes sense to start 
the marketing push well in advance. The teaser itself is just that, a 

teaser.  Little in the way of plot is revealed beyond what can be gath-
ered from the title: Batman, Superman, they fight.  As many expect-
ed, the fallout from the last film’s destructive ending has a lot of the 
world against Superman, none more so it seems than Ben Affleck’s 
Bruce Wayne. Suiting up in a heavily armored version of the bat-suit, 
he goes to face a very angry looking Superman asking him, “Do you 
bleed?” before assuring him, “You will.”
   The film definitely looks to be continuing the darker tone set by 
“Man of Steel,” an artistic decision sure to please and frustrate audi-
ences in equal measure, just as its predecessor did. Given the fact 
that “Man of Steel” made a lot less money than the studio was hop-
ing for, continuing the franchise without any significant changes in 
approach beyond “Just put Batman in it” seems like a questionable 
way to go.  Will enough people turn up for another movie with a 
neck-snapping Superman?  Do audiences actually want a Batman 
who outright threatens to make his opponents bleed?  There is a long 
way to go before those questions are answered, and the first teaser 
does not give a lot of hope for the future.

Poetry at its finest
“Hawaiian Shirts in the Electric Chair”

   Scott Laudati, a budding author 
and poet, writes with wonder and 
passion. His collection of poems 
entitled “Hawaiian Shirts in the 
Electric Chair,” is easy to read and connect with. Readers don’t 
need to be expert readers or poets to enjoy his work and there is no 
need to analyze every word choice or combination. These poems 
are simply for those who love the written word in all its artistic 
forms. The first poem in line, “Can We Live Like This,” is written 
in an open-ended style, leaving the meaning up to the interpretation 
of the reader. It could be about a lover who fell out of love, or it 
could be a case of unrequited love. It could just be that the narrator 
is lamenting on the loss of a good friend, with no romantic feelings 
involved.
   Another poem in the collection is “The Dog Days Are Over.” The 
narrator seems to be commending his dog for being calm and stead-
fast in the face of uncertainty and danger. He seems to take solace 

in the anchor that is man’s best friend. He thinks about how simple 
happiness can be. While some may require expensive gifts and 
travels abroad to bring them happiness, all this narrator needs is the 
dog. When it comes to poetry, many of us assume that all poetry is 
about love and loss or anger. Laudati shows us how to appreciate 
poetry from all emotions and thoughts, not necessarily the most 
passionate and debilitating emotions.
   Throughout the book, the poems are told in first person to better 
help the readers to connect with the emotions and situations con-
veyed. The characters seem deep and thoughtful, but their words 
are vague enough so as to leave their thoughts and emotions some-
what interpretable. The poems are creative and fluid, changing from 
one feeling at the beginning to entirely new feelings at the end. 
They are complex enough to entertain, but not inaccessible. 
   It is a very good read, especially for those who enjoy reading 
but want something lighter than our textbooks. They are sad and 
beautiful, but sometimes filled with hope and promise. The book 
is engaging, thoughtful and inspiring, and funny. There are poems 
about dogs, UFOs, cocaine, friendship, love, bravery and time. 
Some are political and some are lighter. 
   Laudati expresses the idea of death in one of the most fearless 
ways. He is not trying to be a world-renowned poet, rather he is 
simply expressing his voice and thoughts for others to read and cri-
tique. His writing is brutally honest and unapologetic, he says what 
he feels and thinks no matter how raw and gritty it may seem. The 
theme seems to be connected to remaining innocence, a will to pre-
serve it, and a fear of losing it.
   “Putting the Art Back in Kmart” is about art itself and how 
destructive and beautiful it can be. Not all art can be held to the 
same standard as “beauty is in the eye of the beholder.” 
   We all find different forms of art pleasing. The compilation of 
poetry in “Hawaiian Shirts in the Electric Chair” is wonderful, both 
for those who already love poetry and for those who want to test 
the waters.

Jon Stewart leaves
 The Daily Show

   Jonathan Stewart 
is an American 
critic, political sati-
rist, writer, televi-
sion host, and stand-up comedian. Born November 
1962 in New York City, he and his family lived 
in New Jersey after his grandparents immigrated 
to the United States from Eastern Europe. In high 
school, Stewart was the victim of anti-Semitic 
bullying along with his older brother, Lawrence. 
Stewart graduated from the College of William 
and Mary in 1984, where he had been a member of 
the soccer team and had studied chemistry before 
switching to psychology. 
   After finishing school Stewart worked a number 
of jobs, one of which was as a bartender at City 
Gardens where he learned that he was not a “giant 
weirdo” and that “maybe there are other people 
who have a similar sense of yearning for some-
thing other than what they have now.”
Stewart made his stand-up debut at The Bitter 
End, the same place where comedian Woody Allen 
began his career. This is where Stewart changed 
his name from Stuart-Leibowitz to Stewart, due to 
pronunciation and an estranged relationship with 
his father.
   In 1999, Stewart replaced Craig Kilborn on “The 
Daily Show.” While the show discusses the politi-
cal climate and pokes fun at certain political fig-
ures, Stewart considers it to be nothing more than 
“schnicks and giggles,” rather than a political opin-
ion to be taken seriously. However much of the 
information on the show is factual, and is delivered 
in an informal and accessible manner. 
   Save for several temporary instances Stewart has 
been the sole host for 16 years, occasionally giving 
the chair to comedians like Stephen Colbert and 
John Oliver. Stewart has won a total of 19 Emmy 
Awards for his role as host. “The Daily Show” won 
two Peabody Awards in 2000 and 2004 for cover-
age of the presidential elections. 
   In September 2001, Stewart addressed the 

attack on the World Trade Center by forgoing the 
usual introduction to the show, which consisted 
of an aerial view of the Twin Towers. He instead 
lamented on the attack, which he dubbed an attack 
on “the symbol of American ingenuity, strength, 
labor, imagination, and commerce.” He did how-
ever, go on to say that “the view from the south of 
Manhattan is now the Statue of Liberty. You can’t 
beat that.”
   This February, Stewart announced that he would 
be leaving “The Daily Show.” This was later con-
firmed by the Comedy Central president, Michele 
Ganeless.
   Stewart is Jewish, although he doesn’t prac-
tice the religion. He is married to Tracey Lynn 
McShane, and the couple have two children, 
Nathan and Maggie Rose. They have a cat and two 
dogs named Stanley, Monkey and Shamsky respec-
tively. While Stewart has been labeled a Democrat, 
he considers himself “more socialist or indepen-
dent,” and has voted for Republican candidates in 
the past. He is an avid fan of the New York Giants 
and the New York Mets, and he also admires Bruce 
Springsteen.
   Stewart’s replacement is Trevor Noah, a South 
African political satirist, host, media critic, and 
comedian. He was born to a South African mother 
and a Swiss father, and his family suffered dur-
ing the era of apartheid. His ethical background 
and experiences are often a part of his routine. He 
began corresponding with “The Daily Show” in 
December 2014, and on March 30 2015, Comedy 
Central announced that he would be taking over in 
Stewart’s place. Although his selection has been 
met with some criticism, Noah shows confidence 
in his new role and describes himself, like Stewart, 
as a political progressive.
   In his farewell on “The Daily Show,” Stewart 
joked about how this was the longest he has held a 
job “by 16 years and five months.” He said it was 
time to give someone else the opportunity to run 
the show and that he had “a lot of things, got a lot 
of ideas in his head,” 
jokingly naming “dinner 
with my family” as one 
of them. 
   After thanking the 
crew of the show and 
joking around some 
more with the audience, 
Stewart showed the 
viewers “A Moment of 
Zen,” where a monkey 
washed a cat in a sink. 
While the relevance of 
such a clip shall be left 
to the viewer, it is clear 
with the audience’s 
reaction during his 
speech that he will be 
sorely missed. We can 
only hope that Trevor 
Noah lives up to the 
expectations.

Hardcore bands perform locally at The Low Beat.

   Seasoned Albany-
area promoter 
CR OM hosted a 
legendary show at 
Albany’s very own The Low Beat on Saturday 
April 11, to a band of thrash-hungry mutants who 
were foaming at the mouth by the time local trio 
Sick Mind took the stage. Although technical 
problems with the bass player’s amplifier cut their 
anticipated set short, they blitzed through numer-
ous tracks before calling it quits and clearing the 
stage for Montreal’s modern-day answer to 80s 
metal, Metalian. 
   The leather-clad Canadian rockers burst into a 
set of searing guitar-work, perfect falsettos and 
chest thumping drum-and-bass syncopation that 
encapsulated the 
crowd of vari-
ous patrons. Lead 
singer Ian Wilson 
was spotted on and 
off the front moni-
tors, belting guitar 
licks just before 
returning to his 
microphone to kick 
off another run of 
reverb-saturated 
vocals. 
   Bass player 
Andres Arango’s 
face could barely 
be seen through his 
long locks of jet 
black hair, as he 
pelted the audience 
with an onslaught 
of effortless bass 
work, all while 
head banging in 
unison with the 
tireless drumming of 
Tony Cantara. 
   Lead guitar-
ist Simon Costa, who looked oddly like Danny 
Masterson of “That 70’s Show” fame, was jumping 
between coordinating perfect melodic guitar-work 
with Wilson and intense solos of his own. It was 
surprising to see the strings hadn’t been literally 
shred off his guitar. 
   Metalian’s set consisted of almost all originals, 
including “Conquest” which is six-minute music 
epic of varying solos, tandem guitar harmonies and 
aggressively shifting rhythms. Vocalist/Guitarist 
Ian Wilson’s banshee-like vocals screamed “Just 
look at your men, how fearful and frightened; our 
time has come to move on…” as the band prepared 
for the next transition of the track. 
   They plowed through a quick-paced rendition 
of “Sonic Attack” and completed a couple ster-
ling takes of their new material off their latest EP, 
“Metal, Fire and Ice.” Completing their set after 
two bonus encore songs left the crowd hungry for 
Cleveland, OH natives Party Plates. 
   Hardcore music is nothing new to this quintet, 

who blasted into their set with the velocity of a 
fighter jet, hammering the audience with lively 
stage antics and relentless speed. The tireless 
crowd responded multiple times by inciting a circle 
pit, while the vocalist delivered the lyrics without 
skipping a beat. 
   Party Plates style is reminiscent of just about 
every relevant hardcore band in the past 30 years, 
including Bad Brains, Minor Threat and even some 
tinges of D.R.I. at times. The ferocity of their set 
completed the evening in perfect form and it was 
clear that the Albany crowd who had gathered had 
received quite a show for the $7 cover charged 
they gladly forked over upon entrance into The 
Low Beat. 
   Upon completion of the final pint of the night, it 

was clear that the Montreal metal troupe Metalian 
had stolen the show outright. Their presence on 
stage, complete ownership of their highly influ-
enced style, and perfect form put them ahead of 
the equally entertaining groups booked for the 
nights. 
   It was a shame that Sick Mind encountered 
some issues early on in their set, as the crowd 
would have loved to see more of their material in 
action; they’re definitely a local band to keep on 
the radar. 
   Party Plates was everything to love about hard-
core music, from the herky-jerky movements of 
the lead singer on-stage to the constant barrage 
of distorted sound issued by the guitar and bass 
player. Metalian however left a void after their 
set. Their music reeked of 80s heavy metal, their 
sound comparable to the likes of Iron Maiden and 
Judas Priest among others. Without a doubt, the 
Albany area needs more international acts like the 
earth shattering Metalian to grace us with their 
presence.

   The University at Albany base-
ball team (11-19, 5-6 AE) came 
into three game weekend series 
at Varsity Field against Stony 
Brook University (23-12, 12-2 
AE) with the hopes of challeng-
ing the Seawolves for first place 
in the America East standings. 
The challenge was denied as 
UAlbany fell three times to 
its top in-conference rival and 
remained in second place. 
    Saturday’s first game of the 
doubleheader could not have 
gone any worse for the Great 
Danes, who allowed 15 runs on 
18 hits by the Seawolves, in a 
15-3 beating. 
   “We did not pitch well in game 
one,” said head coach Jon Muel-
ler. “We knew it was going to be 
difficult sledding and we really 
struggled with our bullpen’s 
effort.” 
   Stony Brook opened up the 
scoring in the fourth inning with 
a two-run double by Andruw 
Gazzola that sailed over a diving 
Will Miller in deep left-center 
field to drive in the first two runs. 
Jeremy Giles followed with an-
other Stony Brook run in the fifth 
inning after hitting a sacrifice fly 
to centerfield, allowing Casey 

Baker to score from 
third. 
   With the bases load-
ed and one out, UAl-
bany responded with 
a two-run double into 
the left-center field gap 
by Shawn Blake to put 
the Danes within one. 
In the same half in-
ning, Trevor DeMerritt 
followed with an RBI 
groundout to tie the 
game at three. 
   The Seawolves 
lineup, however, 
would not let up the 
run production. Stony 
Brook ensued with two 
runs in the sixth, three 
runs in the seventh, 
four runs in the eighth, 
and three runs in the 
ninth, outscoring the 
Danes 12-0 over the 
final four innings.
   UAlbany’s starter, 
Brendan Ryan, was pulled after 
allowing five runs, four earned, 
on eight hits over 5.1 innings. 
Terry Dugdale, Sam DeCelle and 
Cameron Sorgie appeared in re-
lief from the Danes bullpen and 
surrendered a combined ten runs 
over just 3.2 innings of work. 
   Stony Brook’s Toby Handley 
led all hitters with four hits and 
three runs batted in, while Jack 

Parenty ended the first game with 
five runs batted in on two hits, 
including a three-run double in 
the ninth inning.
   Eight of Stony Brook’s nine 
hitters recorded at least one run 
batted in and all nine recorded at 
least one base hit apiece. 
   In game two, the Great Danes 
hoped to keep the scoring from 
the opposing side at a minimum 
with Stephen Woods on the 

mound. Fortunately for Stony 
Brook, starting pitcher Daniel 
Zamora went head-to-head with 
Woods deep into the game, al-
lowing just one run over four hits 
and seven strikeouts in Stony 
Brook’s 2-1 victory. 
   Woods got off to a quick start, 
striking out six batters over his 
first four innings of work.
   Zamora matched Woods and 
was even more dominant with 

seven punch-outs 
and no runs allowed 
over the first four 
frames.
   In the second in-
ning, Stony Brook 
brought home the 
first run of the game 
on a fielder’s choice 
groundout that al-
lowed Gazzola to 
score from third. 
   Two innings later, 
Woods struck out 
the first two batters 
he faced before giv-
ing up a solo homer 
to Gazzola that put 
Stony Brook up 2-0. 
   In the bottom half 
of that inning, Trev-
or DeMerritt stepped 
up to the plate with 
the bases loaded, but 
grounded out to the 
pitcher and stranded 
all three runners for 
the Danes.
   After lead off hits by Eric 
Mueller and Karson Canaday to 
kickoff the fifth inning, UAlbany 
had another opportunity to score 
with runners in scoring position. 
With one out and runners on 
second and third, Alex Luska-
vich hit a sacrifice fly to deep 
centerfield that allowed Mueller 
to score the Danes’ first run of 

game two. 
   But that would be all the run 
support for Woods’ outing of 
seven innings, two runs allowed 
on three hits, and seven strike-
outs. The Danes would strikeout 
ten times in game two and strand 
six base runners in the one run 
loss. 
   “You tell me your pitcher gives 
up three hits and strikes out 
seven guys over seven and you 
think you’re going to win that 
game, but [Stony Brook] pitched 
a little bit better than us,” said 
Mueller after the pair of defeats.
   “We had a tough time against 
these Stony Brook pitchers 
today. We didn’t protect the plate 
good enough and we failed to 
cash in with runners on base.”
   In the third game of their series 
on Sunday afternoon, Stony 
Brook continued the offensive 
onslaught, beating UAlbany 12-2 
to finish off a three game sweep. 
   After a doubleheader at NYIT 
on Tuesday, UAlbany will con-
tinue America East play at home 
for a three game series vs UMass 
Lowell this weekend.

Women’s Lacrosse pounds UMBC on Senior Day

By KelSey auman 
Staff Writer  
sports.asp@gmail.com
 
   The University at Albany 
women’s lacrosse team (13-3, 
5-1 AE) dismantled UMBC (8-8, 
3-3 AE) 20-5 this Saturday after-
noon in their final home game to 
improve to a 9-0 record at John 
Fallon Field. 
 This season marked the first 
time that UAlbany has been 
undefeated at home in Division 
I play. The win was a perfect 
ending to the afternoon, which 
had begun with an emotion-
ally charged senior recognition 
ceremony.
   UAlbany head coach John 
Battaglino is proud of his se-
niors, who have developed into, 
“elite players in this league,” as 
he said. He is impressed with 
their work ethic and the career 
they’ve had, but he was also 
quick to mention that they, “ 
have more [work] to do.”
   UAlbany carried momentum 
from the pregame ceremony into 
the first half of the game, open-
ing the scoring less than three 
minutes into the game with a 
goal by Maureen Keggins. Soon 

after, Rachel Bowles made it 2-0 
UAlbany on a free point shot.
   UMBC was able to counter 
with a goal after a long posses-
sion in the UAlbany zone, but 
they did not have an answer for 
UAlbany’s relentless attack. 
A goal by Bowles on the man 
advantage gave the Great Danes 
a 3-1 lead and began an eight 
goal rally. The Danes were able 
to build momentum due to six 
consecutive faceoff wins in this 
span, with contributions coming 
from several different players.
   The Danes built their lead to 
13-2 at the half, with contribu-
tions from Dakotah Savitcheff 
and Alie Jimerson. With Sav-
itcheff’s two goals in the first 
half, both assisted by Keggins, 
Savitcheff became UAlbany’s 
all time leader in single season 
goals. She passed Jodi Battaglia, 
who had previously held the 
record with 56 in 2011. 
   The second frame began with a 
tally from Bowles on a laser of a 
shot. The ensuing three goal run, 
led by Keggins, gave the Danes a 
commanding 17-2 lead.  A costly 
turnover forced by Michelle 
Primomo was able to negate a 
UMBC faceoff win and result 
in another goal for the Danes, 

this time by Jimerson. Goals 
by Rachel Bowles and Emma 
Powlin rounded out the scoring 
for UAlbany with five minutes 
left in the game.
   UAlbany’s defense was able 
to hold off UMBC thanks in part 
to the goaltending of Courtney 
Henderson, who finished with 
seven saves in her 13th win of 
the season.  UAlbany also had 

only 6 turnovers, their lowest 
number on the season.  
   Senior Maureen Keggins had 
a record-breaking day as she 
led the offense with six goals 
and five assists. She tied Rachel 
Burek’s record for most points 
in a single game with 11. With 
85 points on the season, Keggins 
also surpassed Rachel Burek’s 
previously held record of 84 

to become UAlbany’s all time 
single season points leader.
   Keggins said that, because her 
parents were in attendance for 
the ceremony, this game was a 
little more special than most.  
   “Our energy was really high,” 
Keggins said. “We left it all on 
the field.” 
   The seniors were able to main-
tain their composure throughout 
the game, which Keggins cred-
ited to their experience.
   Battaglino, whose squad has 
now set a program record with a 
total of 369 points on the season, 
was very proud of his team’s 
effort. “I thought it was a great 
way to honor our seniors, to have 
our kids play that well.”  
   He is confident in his squad en-
tering postseason play. No matter 
who they will be playing against, 
he said, “they’re not afraid.” 
   “They’ve played some of the 
top five teams in the country 
and they’ve all been couple goal 
games.”  To finish the regular 
season with a game like this, in 
which his team was, as he said, 
“firing on all cylinders,” certain-
ly can’t hurt either.
   With the win, UAlbany 
clinched the number two seed 
in the upcoming America East 

Tournament at Stony Brook. 
They will take on Vermont in 
the semifinals on Friday, May 1 
at 7:30 p.m.  The winner of that 
game will play Sunday at noon 
in the championship game on 
ESPN3.

   The University at Albany men's 
lacrosse team ended one of the 
most successful regular seasons 
in school history this past Sat-
urday at Bob Ford Field with a 
20-9 blowout win over America 
East conference rival UMBC.

   Last week, UAlbany defeated 
Yale in front of a record setting 
crowd of 4,283 in the school’s 
first lacrosse game at Bob Ford 

Field. On Saturday, 2,514 fans 
packed Bob Ford Field to see the 
Great Danes earn their sixth win 
in a row.
   Ranked seventh in the coun-
try, the Great Danes (13-2, 6-0 
America East) never relinquished 
a lead that started just 27 seconds 
into the game off of a Seth Oakes 
score.   
   The Great Danes' offense was 
clicking early and often in the 
first quarter as they scored 10 
goals in the opening quarter, two 
more goals then UMBC (5-8, 1-5 
America East) has given up on 
average for an entire game this 
season.
   The Great Danes seemingly 
had the game wrapped up at 

halftime, as they held a 15-2 lead 
after two quarters. Connor Fields 
paced the Great Danes with five 
goals in the first half, and Seth 
Oakes, Lyle Thompson Tim Cox 
each had four points at the half. 
  Thompson, who continues to 
pad his record as NCAA Divi-
sion I lacrosse's all-time leading 
points scorer, had the crowd on 
its feet with several spectacu-
lar plays, including a highlight 
reel finish against three UMBC 
defenders. 
   The Retrievers were held 
scoreless the entire second 
quarter as UAlbany’s defense 
held strong, frequently forcing 
turnovers. Goalie Blaze Riorden 
had another strong game, one in 
which his dominance allowed 
UAlbany to give backup goalie 
JD Colarusso significant playing 
time, following Riorden’s game 
saving efforts against Yale just a 
week ago.
   UMBC rallied in the fourth, 
scoring five goals in a row, 
primarily against UAlbany's 
backups. But the deficit was too 
much to overcome. The Great 
Danes capped off a dominant ef-
fort in which his team converted 
on 21 of 33 shots and won two 
thirds of the faceoffs.
   The Great Danes were led by 
five goals from Fields and three 
each by Thompson and Oakes. 
Coming off the bench, Tim Cox, 
Tom Nuckel, and Kyle McClan-

cy each scored a pair of goals. 
Pat Young scored three goals to 
lead for the visiting Retrievers.
   The Great Danes honored their 
10 graduating seniors on Satur-
day. The seniors will finish their 
careers as part of a UAlbany 
program that has changed the 
way lacrosse is played nation-
ally. The fast paced nature of the 
Great Danes is something coach 
Scott Marr recognized.
   "They really have seen the 
evolution of our program from 
the time they were freshman to 
where we are now and the pace 
that we do play and how it has 
affected the rest of the game," 
Marr said. 
   This team has made an impact 
nationally and Marr recognized 
the accomplishments of his de-
parting seniors saying that other 
college teams try to emulate the 
way the Great Danes play. 
   “We talked everyday about 
playing our standard,” Marr said. 
“[Our seniors] saw the older 
guys holding that tradition, and 
we want to play at that same 
level and intensity.”
   Marr's squad has the nation's 
most potent offensive attack, 
leading the nation with over 17 
goals a game. The Great Danes 
goals per game average is three 
more than the second place 
Syracuse Orange. Seth Oakes 
and Connor Fields both rank in 
the national top 10 in goals per 

game average with 
over three each.
  This year’s team 
stacks up well nation-
ally on the offensive 
end, and that’s not 
even mentioning Lyle 
Thompson, who has 
the second highest 
assist total in NCAA 
Division I history to 
go along with the most 
points.
   After wrapping up 
their third-straight 
perfect America East 
season and taking 
home the regular 
season championship, 
UAlbany will host the 
upcoming conference 
tournament.
  The Great Danes' 
next game will be 
this Thursday against 
Hartford at Bob Ford 
Field in the semi-finals 
of the America East 
tournament at 7 p.m.
   If the Great Danes 
defeat Hartford, they 
will play in the Amer-
ica East Championship 
game on Saturday, May 
2 at 10 a.m. against the 
winner of Thursday’s 
game between Vermont and 
Stony Brook. 
    

Men’s Lacrosse crushes UMBC to finish regular season

            UAlbany will host America East Tournament at Bob Ford Field. 

Playing for the red, white, blue, purple, and gold

   
   It’s 7 a.m. on a typical spring 
day at the University at Albany. 
The majority of college students 
are still sleeping after long nights 
of completing homework, study-
ing for exams, and socializing. 
   Freshman field hockey star 
Anna Bottino is doing all of the 
above. Except she’s awake at 7 
a.m. and ready to attack the day. 
   She usually starts the day with 
a 30 minute run by herself just to 
get the juices flowing for the rest 
of the day. After she is warmed 
up from the run, she goes im-

mediately to spring field hockey 
practice at the athletic complex. 
   If she feels she hasn’t had a 
satisfactory morning so far, she 
likes to stay after practice to 
work on her individual skills 
before heading to her two classes 
of the day. 
   By the end of her classes, it is 
between noon and 1 p.m., and 
she has accomplished more in 
her day so far than the prototypi-
cal college student will for the 
entire day.
   To put it bluntly, Bottino 
knows the keys to success, as 
evident by her accomplishments 
on and off of the field.
   This past season, Bottino was 

named America East Rookie of 
the Year after starting 22 of 23 
games for a Great Danes team 
that reached the Final Four in 
October. She earned Second 
Team America East honors, as 
well as a selection to National 
Field Hockey Coaches Asso-
ciation All-Northeast Region 
Second Team. 
   Despite her constant work in 
the offseason to improve, Bottino 
never expected the amount of 
success she and her team had in 
her first season at UAlbany.
   “I thought I was going to be 
starting on the bench. The quality 
of play was very high and I had 
to get used to it,” Bottino said of 
the transition to NCAA competi-
tion. “I was really nervous the 
first game, but the team helped 
me adjust. If you do something 
wrong, they let you know.” 
   UAlbany won the America 
East conference to qualify for the 
NCAA tournament. Their team 
wasn’t expected to go as far as 
they did simply because UAlba-
ny isn’t recognized as a national 
powerhouse in field hockey.
   The Great Danes defied the 
odds by beating powerhouses 
Wake Forest and Maryland 
before falling to UConn in the 
Final Four. Bottino says her 
favorite UAlbany moment so far 
was when the Great Danes upset 
No. 2 Maryland to advance to 
play Connecticut in the national 
semifinals. They were the first 
UAlbany team in any sport to 
reach the national Final Four. 

   “We played our hearts out 
versus Wake Forest. To beat 
Maryland, we knew we had to 
play our game and play the best 
we could,” Bottino said. “It was 
the best moment of my career 
when the buzzer went off and we 
beat Maryland.”
   The Danes would go on to lose 
1-0 in the Final Four to UConn. 
However, Bottino and her 
teammates are proud of putting 
UAlbany on the map this year 
and are excited for the upcoming 
season in the fall.
   ”We are losing four seniors. 
But we have a very good class 
of freshmen coming in that will 
definitely add depth. We are go-
ing to need to take it one game at 
a time,” said Bottino. 
   Before even thinking about a 

second consecutive trip to the 
Final Four, Bottino is making 
sure her and her teammates are 
focused on competing in the 
America East first and foremost. 
Stanford will join the America 
East next season, which will cer-
tainly make the Danes’ trip to the 
NCAA tournament even more 
difficult than this past season.
   And perhaps even more aston-
ishing than the several accolades 
mentioned, Bottino was nomi-
nated to try out for the Under-19 
USA Field Hockey team this past 
January. She made the team in 
March, and represented the USA 
in exhibition games in mid-April 
for one week in Belgium.
   “It was an amazing experience 
to wear my country’s uniform 
along with some of the best girls 

in the country,” Bottino said of 
her recent trip. 
   She will continue to go to the 
team’s practice facility in Penn-
sylvania for four to five days 
every month for the next few 
months for team workouts and 
practices. She says representing 
the United States in the Olym-
pics one day is definitely a dream 
of hers. Just as she doesn’t like 
to speculate about how far the 
Great Danes will go next season, 
she insists on taking that process, 
“one day at a time,” as well.

   The Tewaaraton Foundation 
has announced that University at 
Albany attackman Lyle Thompson 
has been named a Tewaaraton 
nominee.
   Thompson, a 2014 co-Tewaara-
ton Trophy recipient with brother 
Miles Thompson, was one of 25 
men’s players selected as Tewaara-
ton nominees.  The field of 25 will 
be narrowed to five finalists on 
Thursday, May 7, with the 15th 

Annual Tewaaraton Award Cer-
emony being held at the Smithson-
ian on Thursday, May 28.
   It is the third year running that 
Thompson has been named a 
nominee. He was one of the five 
finalists in each 2013 and 2014.
   Thompson currently leads all of 
Division I with 6.29 points and 
3.79 assists per game, tallying 35 
goals and 53 assists on the year for 
88 points. He became the NCAA 

all-time leading scorer in Divi-
sion I and has led UAlbany to a 
#7 ranking in the USILA Coaches 
Poll and Inside Lacrosse media 
poll, the team’s highest placement 
since 2007.

   Graduation can create feelings 
of excitement and accomplish-
ment. Along with these positive 
feelings, you may also experi-
ence stress about your future and 
apprehension about change. 
   Those of you 
who are plan-
ning to graduate 
this semester 
are probably 
pursuing many 
different and 
unique paths. 
Some of you may 
be heading to 
further your edu-
cation through 
studying law, 
business, medi-
cine, psychol-
ogy, or another 
discipline. Others 
may already 
have a job lined 
up. Some of you 
may plan on 
continuing your 
education after 
gaining some 
work experience. 
And a large num-
ber of you will 
be looking for a 
job after moving 
back home. 
   In spite of the 
range of pos-
sibilities, you all 
have one thing 
in common - 
change. Change 
can affect several 
areas of a per-
son’s life. 
   But there are some ways you 
can deal with all this change.
   First, be aware that “good 
stress” is still stress. Enjoy the 
positive, natural high that you 
get from good stress, but also be 
aware of the toll it may be taking 
on your body and your mind.

   Second, check in with yourself 
once in a while and try to figure 
out what you are thinking and 
feeling.
   Third, take care of yourself 
physically by eating well and 
getting enough sleep and exer-
cise. Take steps to balance work, 
social activities, and relaxation.
   And fourth, keep an eye out 
for signs of stress - a change in 

your temperament, a change in 
sleeping patterns, or a change in 
eating habits. These signs may 
indicate that you need to find 
more ways to help yourself cope 
with the new changes in your 
life.
   Be aware that the transition 
from college to graduate school 
or the professional world may 

not be completely smooth. The 
lifestyle you have grown ac-
customed to as an undergraduate 
will be disrupted, and you will 
need to adapt accordingly.
   If you would like to talk to a 
trained peer about time manage-
ment or academic success, you 
can call the Middle Earth Peer 
Assistance hotline at 518-442-
5777. The Middle Earth Peer As-
sistance hotline 
is free, anony-
mous, and open 
when classes at 
the University 
at Albany are in 
session during 
the academic 
year (September 
through May). 
The 
hotline hours 
are from 1 p.m. 
to midnight 
Monday through 
Thursday and 24 
hours on week-
ends beginning 
on Friday at 1 
p.m. and ending 
on Sunday at 
midnight.
   If you would 
like to talk to 
a professional 
confidentially 
about this topic, 
there is a great 
option for you. 
If you are a 
UAlbany student, 
you can make an 
appointment at 
the University 
Counseling Cen-
ter with a mental 
health profes-
sional to discuss 
this subject further. To make 
an appointment with any of the 
psychologists at the Counseling 
Center, call 518-442-5800. Addi-
tional information about services 
that the Counseling Center offers

   Joan Murray and Alicia Suskin 
Ostriker may not be crazy, but 
they do hear voices.
   The two women who visited 
the University at Albany on 
Thursday, April 23 as part of a 
New York State Writers Institute 
event, are poets. Both mentioned 
hearing the voices of their char-
acters.
   “I have to really listen,” Mur-
ray said.
   When she feels as though a 
character is speaking to her, she 
writes down what she hears. 
The poets explained that they 
believe it is their responsibility to 
share what is being told to them 
by characters they may create. 

   “We can get something said in 
lots of different ways but it's our 
obligation as poets to write it in 
the voice that was given to us,” 
Murray said. 
   However, the poets agreed that 
they face subjects that are dif-

ficult to share in their 
personal voices.
   “Usually when I get 
stuck with something 
it’s because I am trying 
to capture something 
in my net of language,” 
Ostriker said.
   For a poet, listening 
to voices they may 
hear is easy. Those 
voices tell stories. Us-
ing their own voices 
to tell the stories is 
harder. 
   Murray offered some 
advice to aspiring po-
ets trying to find their 
own voice.
   “Read poetry,” she 
said. “It can be so 
completely different but they’re 
all ways to hear what your voice 
is as a poet.”
   With countless different types 
of poetry, reading it can seem 
daunting. 
   Ostriker began writing poetry 
by counting syllables and lines 
before a friend of hers told her 
she wrote like she was stuck in 
the past.
   “You don’t write like you’re in 
the 20th century,” she recalled 
him saying. 
   From then on, she began 
writing free verse more consis-
tently. However, she never again 
referred to it as that name.
   “It’s open form,” she said. “It’s 
like improvisation.”
   Ostriker admitted that, in this 
sense, poetry is similar to jazz 
music. While there is an ele-
ment of music in her writing, she 
explains that there is a story as 
well.
   “Human beings love stories, 
human beings love narrative,” 
she said.
   The two poets agreed that 
poetry is not just song and not 

just story.
   “We’re making art here,” Mur-
ray said. 
   Poetry is made up of countless 
different pieces. 
   “When you write from your 
own depths,” Ostriker said, “If 
you find the language, if you find 
the music, if you find what trans-
lates the nonverbal stuff in you 
into language, then it will come 
across to other people.”
   While finding a topic to write 
about can be difficult, the poets 
agreed that it is something that 
comes from their own minds. 
   “What a poet does do if they 
want to be really powerful is pur-
sue his or her own obsessions,” 
Ostriker said. “Whatever you 
can’t stop yourself from brood-
ing about, that’s your subject.”
   Ostriker’s most recent book, 
entitled “The Old Woman, the 
Tulip, and the Dog” was released 
last year. Murray’s latest collec-
tion, “Swimming for the Ark: 
New & Selected Poems 1990-
2015” was published this year.

24 percent, and aims to improve 
the graduation rate. According to 
the Common Data Set, the six-
year graduation rate for the 2008 
class was 66 percent; for the 
2007 class, it was 66.4 percent; 
and for the 2006 class, it was 
62.6 percent. 
   The increase in grant and 
tuition revenue has also given 
UAlbany administration the abil-
ity to plan for the future more ac-
tively, rather than just “reacting.” 
Administration does not have to 
make “mid-year adjustments” as 
much anymore, Van Voorst said.

   “We were having conversations 
two years ago about next year,” 
he said, because administrators 
knew that the tuition plan was 
in place if state aid did not come 
through.
   Another benefit, according to 
Van Voorst, is that 83 percent of 
graduates are working in New 
York State after college. 
   
The final year
   “Part of this compact is we 
need to show how we use that 
money,” Van Voorst said. 
   All SUNY schools will present 
their results when the NYSUNY 

2020 legislation comes to an end 
after the 2015-16 academic year. 
The state will have to decide 
whether or not to renew the plan 
and offer more funding.
   “How efficiently and how ef-
fectively do the schools use those 
dollars? That’s what it comes 
down to,” Van Voorst said. 
   He said that UAlbany is try-
ing to hold its standards high 
with the money it received. He 
is uneasy about what the future 
would hold if NYSUNY 2020 is 
not extended.

OPINIONS

 The 2016 
Presidential Elec-
tions are more 
than a year away, 
yet the speculations have already begun. On the 
Republican side, we have a large pool of potential 
candidates. Three of them (Ted Cruz, Rand Paul, 
and Marco Rubio) have already announced their 
candidacy, with many more planning to announce 
and forming exploratory committees.
   On the Democratic side, the field is less crowded. 
On the surface, there is one person who will run: 
Hillary Clinton. She is the only one that has an-
nounced so far. Despite possible options such as 
Vice President Joe Biden and Senator Elizabeth 
Warren, it is looking to be a coronation for the 
former First Lady.
   On paper, Clinton looks to be the best candidate 
the Democrats can offer up. Clinton is doing very 
well in polls for primary and general elections. 
According to Real Clear Politics (RCP), Clinton 
is 50 points ahead of any Democratic challenger. 
In general election polls, she beats all Republican 
challengers. The closest challenge, according to 
RCP, is from Marco Rubio, and she beats him by 
7.5 points.
   Clinton has a few qualities that set her apart from 
her challengers. Her biggest asset is the politi-
cal dynasty she forged with her husband, former 
President Bill Clinton. This empire has produced 
millions of dollars and political connections across 
the country. These connections led to her next 
asset: experience. As a former first lady, Clinton 
began eight years of seeing the inner workings 
of the White House. She later became a senator 
in New York, where she gained experience in the 
legislature. She later became Secretary of State 
under President Barack Obama, where she gained 
experienced in foreign affairs. This mix of dealing 

with domestic and foreign issues makes Clinton a 
good candidate. 
   On top of all of this, her gender is powerful as 
well. Its benefits are two-fold. Firstly, she could be 
the first female president. This status could drive 
people to the polls to vote for her. The secondary 
use is the shield from any or all attacks against her. 
Just like any critic of President Obama is spun as a 
“racist,” anyone who criticizes Clinton, no matter 
how legitimate the criticism may be, will be painted 
a “sexist.” The “war on women” portrayal has 
worked for Democrats in the past, and may very 
well work for them in 2016. 
   The obvious media support of Clinton may help 
her win the election. Two scandals have recently 
come out that would destroy any Republican in a 
media firestorm. First, Clinton operated out of a 
private email instead of a government email during 
her tenure. This is bad because these emails are 
not on record with the government. In the case that 
these emails needed to be checked or referenced, 
there would be no official record of them. The other 
big scandal was the massive amounts of foreign 
money donated to the Clinton Foundation, a charity 

run by the Clintons. By itself, it may seem mini-
mal. However, tracing back the donations, several 
decisions by Clinton as Secretary of State are called 
into question, such as a Russian nuclear energy 
company, Rosatom, buying a Canadian uranium 
company. Clinton signed off the sale and millions 
of dollars from high ranking employees of Rosatom 
have flooded the Clinton Foundation. Despite these 
troubling stories, the media saved their ferocity, 
initiative, and outrage for much more “impor-
tant” scandals. Such “scandals” ranged from Scott 
Walker not graduating college to Chris Christie 
possibly closing down lanes on the George Wash-
ington Bridge. The news media loves Clinton and 
they are shamelessly not afraid to show it.
   Unfortunately, there are some downsides to 
Clinton beyond those two scandals. Her experi-
ence while in government has been less than stellar. 
As First Lady, Clinton led the committee to push 
her husband’s healthcare reform plan. The plan 
was under fire from the right as well as the health 
insurance agency, and she was tasked with selling 
it to the American public. The task force ultimately 
failed and the plan was never passed. In Congress, 
despite her service, she voted for both wars in Af-
ghanistan and Iraq. Both of those votes came back 
to haunt her in the 2008 election, where she had to 
defend her vote to a party who disliked the wars. 
The entire 2008 election is pretty much an embar-
rassment to Clinton in general. 
   Going into the primaries, Clinton was seen as 
the inevitable candidate to win the Presidency. At 
first, Clinton was the leader in the polls. After a few 
terrible performances in debates, her numbers fell 
as Obama’s number’s rose. What once looked like 
a shoe-in turned out to be a major defeat. After the 
victory of Obama in 2008, she was appointed to be 
his Secretary of State, she accepted. Even without 
the faux Benghazi controversy, Clinton’s tenure as 

Secretary of State was far from stellar. Much of her 
tenure is unremarkable. Russian relations, despite 
her efforts, are no better than they were before her 
appointment. Despite her years of experience, she 
has very little to point to in those years to be proud 
of. At best, she was unexceptional at everything she 
did.
   Despite these flaws, her odds of winning the 
presidency are very good. While it is still very 
early, Clinton is showing an impressive start to the 
2016 campaign. Let’s see if she can finish the job 
this time.

Are you 
#ReadyForHillary again?

“Shut the fuck up!” 
   I heard a student scream from 
the third floor of an Indian Quad 
dorm. It was a Sunday morn-
ing at 11 A.M., and I was in the 
middle of my second campus 
tour of the day. 
   As a tour guide, I recognize 
that the explosively loud voices 
of my 20 coworkers and myself 
can sometimes be intrusive in the 
early hours of a weekend morn-
ing. However, this was not a 
typical Sunday afternoon. It was 
Open House for accepted stu-
dents at the University at Albany. 
This was my second consecutive 
day waking up at 7 a.m., along 
with my fellow tour guides, in 
order to greet thousands of new 
students that were coming to visit 
the university. 
   The last thing I want to do is 
deprive anyone of his or her late 
afternoon sleep, when I myself 
have been awake since the crack 
of dawn. I walk backwards for 
hours throughout the campus and 
answer the same questions some-
times 15 or 20 times a day. 
   None of this ever bothers me: I 
accept it as a part of the job that 
I thoroughly enjoy and look for-
ward to doing every week. I love 
speaking about my experience at 
UAlbany, showcasing our unique 
campus and being in a position 
where I can convince others to 
attend as well. However, the part 
of my job that I refuse to accept 
is the constant encounters with 
students who feel it is acceptable 
to scream profanities or rude 
comments to the large groups of 
people who are receiving their 
first impression of the school. 
   If one is a current student, 
and has ever made a harmful 
comment to a tour group, he/
she makes our jobs increasingly 
more difficult. More importantly, 
he/she makes our university look 
bad as a whole. 
   “Don’t come here, the food 
sucks.” 
   “The TA’s here are terrible.”
   “Coming to this school was the 
worst decision of my life.”
   If my coworkers and I sat down 
to share our collective experi-
ence with the negative comments 
we receive, we would be truly 

bothered. Just know that this is 
our job, and although anyone has 
the freedom to state their com-
ments or shout their opinions, 
before one does, take a second 
to empathize with us. Especially 
to the students that are employed 
elsewhere, think about how you 
would feel if someone followed 
you around just to contradict 
everything you were trying to 
sell or promote. 
   As a tour guide, we truly be-
lieve in the product we are trying 
to sell, which is our school. We 
recognize that students can have 
bad days, and that maybe they do 
not have a great experience with 
all aspects of our campus. What 
we want people to realize is that 
they have an entire year compro-
mised of hundreds of chances to 
have a delicious lunch, for one’s 
teaching assistant to take the 
time to personally help him/her 
with an assignment, or maybe, 
one might step into the sunshine 
at Collins Circle and simply be 
grateful to be here.  However, the 
prospective students and fami-
lies that are following us around 
campus will only have one day to 
make their decision. They should 
be able to make it free from the 
influence of others.
   To those who felt it was okay 
to scream at families through 
their dorm windows, I wish they 
had realized the events that were 
going on. Sometimes, when 
thousands of people visit the 
school, it can be more important 
than that extra hour of com-
pletely peaceful sleep one can get 
on a Sunday morning. It is about 
putting aside one’s exhaustion or 
headache from the night before 
and realize that although these 
tours should be an expected part 
of campus life, they will not hap-
pen every day. In fact, other than 
last weekend, tours never happen 
on Sunday mornings on Indian 
Quad (they do happen Satur-
day mornings on State Quad at 
Fulton Hall- our sincerest apolo-
gies). 
   Open House is crucial because 
it happens to take place right 
before our Admissions Deposit 
Deadline. For many visiting 
students in the next few weeks, 
our campus tours will be the 
deciding factor in regards to at-
tending UAlbany. I ask on behalf 
of my coworkers, Supervising 

Tour Coordinator and Admis-
sions Counselors who I know 
work tirelessly to accommodate 
and interact with thousands of 
our visiting students that people 
please refrain from casually 
directing harmful comments 
at our groups. I only have one 
hour to showcase our university, 
and I would love to spend more 
time talking about our libraries, 
fountains, or resources, than do-
ing damage control because of a 
statement that was made. 
   Lastly, to anyone who intrudes 
on tours because they are truly 
unhappy with their experience at 
UAlbany, I encourage everyone 
to take advantage of the vast re-
sources the university has to of-
fer. There are over 200 clubs you 
can join, professional counselors 
you can speak too, personalized 
tutoring one can receive, or even 
just a different meal plan that 
will be more accommodating to 
your needs.
   And if one needs help, feel 
free to stop by University Hall 
and speak to a tour guide. We 
would love to help, and are more 
than willing to lend a hand when 
it comes to utilizing all of the 
resources UAlbany has to offer.

What is Autism?
   “Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a range of 
complex neurodevelopment disorders, character-
ized by social impairments, communication dif-
ficulties, and restricted, repetitive, and stereotyped 
patterns of behavior,” according to the National 
Institute of Neurological disorders and Stroke, 
which also reports that early signs of autism are 
found when babies are unresponsive to people or 
only focus on one item.
   There are also mild cases of Autism, such as 
Asperger’s syndrome where the central symptom 
is trouble in social situations, such as not picking 
up on body language or the inability to start and 
maintain conversations with other people.

How many people are diagnosed?
   One in 68 U.S. children are diagnosed with 
Autism spectrum disorder (ASD), according to 
the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention 
(CDC) in 2014. This is a 30 percent increase from 
two years ago where only one in 88 children were 
diagnosed, according to a report released by CNN 
in 2014.
   The number of people diagnosed with Autism is 
steadily increasing and the age by which parents 
start to see signs of autism and it is being diagnosed 
is decreasing. The CDC reports that the diagnosis 
of Autism by age two can be valid and reliable and 
parents begin to see signs of autism before a child’s 
first birthday. 
   “ASD is almost five 
times more common 
among boys  (one in 
42) than among girls 
(one in 189),” accord-
ing to the CDC and 
“on average, children 
identified with ASD 
were not diagnosed un-
til after age four, even 
though children can be 
diagnosed as early as 
age two.”
   
Why is Autism in-
creasing?
   The reason for the 
spike in Autism diag-
noses is in part due to 
the expanded diag-
nostic criteria for the 
illness. The Diagnostic 
and Statistical Manual 
of Mental Disorders 
(DSM) has increased 
the criteria eligibility 
for Autism. Accord-
ing to Disabilityscoop.
com, a research team at 
the University of Utah 
matched the diagno-
sis criteria in the 80s to the criteria in the modern 
day and found that “most who were deemed to be 
autism-free at that time would receive the label 
today.”
   “Thus, while it is well known that current DSM-
IV-TR criteria increased the identification of high 
functioning individuals, our results indicate that 
they also increase identification of ASD among in-
dividuals with autism and intellectual impairment,” 
wrote researchers in the study published online in 
the Journal of Autism and Developmental Disor-
ders this month.
   Researchers have also linked the increase in 
Autism to the increase in air pollution. The new 
Harvard study says that exposure to air pollution 
amongst pregnant women, more specifically in their 
third trimester, have an increased chance is birthing 
a child with Autism as reported by NBC news.
   There was also a recent study linking autism to 
the Mumps-Measles-Rubella (MMR) vaccination. 
This study has since been disproven.

Autism in Society
   People who are diagnosed with Autism are fairly 
young, most of the time before they enter school. 
For a long time, Autistic children are in the care of 
their parents or guardians.
   The economic hardships parents have to face to 
sustain a child are increased with Autism. 
   The CDC reports that, “It is estimated to cost at 
least $17,000 more per year to care for a child with 
ASD compared to a child without ASD. Costs in-
clude health care, education, ASD-related therapy, 
family-coordinated services, and caregiver time. 

For a child with more severe ASD, costs per year 
increase to over $21,000. Taken together, it is esti-
mated that total societal costs of caring for children 
with ASD were over $9 billion in 2011.”
   In this case it is far better to get a child diagnosed 
sooner rather than later. This way, the child will be 
able to get the medical attention he or she needs as 
well as learn how to better function in society while 
dealing with Autism.
   “The earlier a child is diagnosed with autism, the 
better their chances of overcoming the difficulties 
that come with the disorder,” according to CNN.

Autism in school
   First thing to know is that nearly one in three 
students report being bullied during the school year, 
according to the National Center for Educational 
statistics in 2013. 
   63 percent of children with Autism had been 
bullied, according to a survey of 1,200 parents who 
had a child with Autism conducted by researchers 
from the Kennedy Krieger Institute in Baltimore 
and Johns Hopkins University. It was also dis-
covered that these children were three times more 
likely to be bullied than their siblings who do not 
have autism.
   Other findings included: 61 percent of children 
with Asperger’s were being bullied and children in 
public schools were 50 percent more like to be bul-
lied than in private of special education schools.
   “One noteworthy finding was children with au-
tism may also become bullies themselves. Twenty 
percent of surveyed parents said their child with au-
tism had bullied others. Most were “bully-victims,” 

meaning they had also been bullied at some point, 
the researchers said.”
   Children with Autism are placed in regular 
classroom settings and their characteristic behav-
ioral traits are not in-line with non-Autistic student, 
which is indicative of their treatment from other 
students.
   
What do we do?
   The first thing to realize is that people with Au-
tism clearly need special attention. This means that 
in public schools, they need a regiment separate 
from the other students: a regiment where they can 
learn at their own pace and they are not troubled 
with constant teasing by their peers.
   People must also realize that people with any 
degree of Autism are still people.  Having Autism 
does not make anyone less of a person and those 
who tease people with autism probably have an 
Autistic person in their family and if it’s not okay 
to tease that family, then it is not okay to tease 
anyone else’s. 
   Dr. Paul Law said,“To experience teasing, taunts, 
ostracism or other forms of spite may make a child 
who was already struggling to cope become com-
pletely unable to function,” in a CBS news article.
   People need to increase awareness for those with 
Autism. It is not easy for them, their parents, or 
their family. 
   People with Autism are more importantly people 
in general and should be treated as such.

Be aware of Autism

   The college experience be-
comes a reality for most students 
once they step on campus. They 
see it on television, movies 
constantly exploit it, and students 
broadcast it on social media. 
   These cookie-cutter depictions 
of college are arbitrary because 
college is a culture shock for 
most incoming students. Think 
about it: people are always re-
flecting on what they could have 
done differently in college. 
The best way to make a smooth 
transition into college is to start 
on the right foot. 
   “You can think of college as an 
incubation period, where you de-
velop your skills and character” 
Quora user Ching Ho wrote in a 
post. “You are likely never going 
to have as many resources, like-
minded peers, free hours, and op-
portunities as you do in college 
again- so use them wisely.” 
   Each person’s experience in 
college is distinctively their own. 
It is pretty easy to dabble into 
too much or suffer from dorm 
room fever, but there are ways to 
create a medium. Students will 
definitely say that creating a bal-
ance is easier said than done, but 
this is a skill one acquires and 
develop over the course of four 
years. 
   One must manage his or her 
time. It sounds cliché, but life is 
a lot more relieving when one is 
conscious of what they can do in 
a day. Some of the common tips 
include writing down tasks, plan-
ning ahead, scheduling in time to 
relax and sleep, and the list goes 
on. The point is to set realistic 

expectations for yourself in order 
to remain satisfied and sane in 
college. 
   College is a journey for ev-
eryone, and it can get stressful. 
For instance, a picture circulated 
on Facebook a couple of years 
ago titled “Choose Two: social 
life, good grades and/or enough 
sleep.” 
   Stress comes with the territory. 
One should ease it by participat-
ing in activities that will keep 
him/her levelheaded like getting 
enough sleep, reaching out to 
others, or relieving tactics. It 
will leave someone with a more 
fulfilling experience knowing 
that he or she is able to take care 
of themself.
   Academic life in college is 
different from academic life 
in high school in that one has 
control over what courses he or 
she wants to take. Choose classes 
wisely and carefully. These are 
classes that one should enjoy and 
will help them complete their 
major or minor.  
   Succeeding academically is 
a two-way street (and some 
would say three-way street). 
Take classes with good profes-
sors. Pick their brain and see 
what they expect out of students. 
Likewise, have a helpful advisor 
that will keep one’s education in 
good standing.
   Students should avoid procras-
tination and all-nighters as much 
as possible by mapping out the 
work they have to do. I have 
heard too many horror stories 
about people staying an extra 
year or extra semester because 
they need to complete their 
credits. Schedule courses each 
semester in a way that will set 

up graduation by the time senior 
year rolls around.
   College life does not fizzle 
once people leave the classroom. 
Interact with people. It is refresh-
ing to know that students can 
leave high school in the past and 
start off with a clean slate: they 
should take advantage of it. This 
means student need to step out 
of their comfort zone and their 
dorm room. 
   There are plenty of people to 
meet in college and tons of ways 
to meet them. Eat with friends, 
talk to people in your hall, go to 
parties, attend events, take on 
internships, or study abroad.
   Most importantly, join clubs 
and organizations. They put 
blocks in peoples’ time for things 
that they are interested in. Orga-
nizational sociologist Daniel F. 
Chambliss at Hamilton College 
made a similar point in a New 
York Times piece.
   “Most people don’t make their 
friends in classes. It helps to join 
a large high-contact activity, like 
a sports team or choir, where 
people see each other at least 
twice a week.” 
   The list of clubs on campus 
that one can join is endless, 
plus one’s chances of finding 
more than one organization that 
matches their interests are pretty 
high. 
   Remember that students have 
four years to figure college out. 
The sooner they start, the better. 
It comes down to dedication and 
patience, which are probably the 
last two words that students want 
to hear, but will help guide them 
in the right direction towards a 
fulfilling college experience.

Understanding the 
college experience

   Classes are set in stone, but 
the way students spend the rest 
of their time in college is for 
them to decide. Use that time 
to participate in extracurricular 
activities.
   “The most basic reason for 
joining a club or team is that it 
gives you something better to 
do than staring at a wall, wan-
dering the hall, or napping all 
afternoon,” TeensHealth.com 
saod. Having an abundance of 
open time is a reality for most 
students, but clubs and various 
activities can and will fill those 
empty holes in their schedule.
   Extracurricular activities 
provide students a break from 
the academic setting. Students 
should remember that college 
is not solely about doing well. 
Instead of perceiving activities as 
a pastime from academics, view 
it as something that compliments 
academics. 
   “The things you do in your free 
time reveal a lot about you in 
ways that grades and test scores 
can’t,” Jeff Brenzel, the dean of 
undergraduate admissions at Yale 
University, claimed. 
   Realistically, students are not 
studying for the entire day. That 
does not mean that academics 
are insignificant, but college life 
encompasses more than school-
work. 

   The types of activities that indi-
viduals can enroll at the Univer-
sity at Albany in are endless. Ac-
cording to MyInvolvement.org, 
activities on campus fall under 
twelve categories: academic, arts, 
cultural, fraternity or sorority, 
media, political, pre-professional, 
recreation, religious, service, 
social, and university resources.
   They key to getting involved is 
finding activities that pertain to 
the interests and goals are for a 
student. The point is for students 
to expand, not confine, their 
horizons because extracurricular 
activities help them gain more 
exposure to what college has to 
offer them.
   This type of fulfillment is not 
only analogous to joining clubs 
and organizations. Internships 
and part time jobs are a satisfy-
ing way to gain work experience, 
professional skills, and compen-
sation at the same time. Resident 
Assistants [RAs] serve as the go-
to people for residents living on 
campus, and they receive perks 
like recognition and free room 
and board. Sports help people 
stay in shape in a recreational 
manner.
   Choose wisely. The amount of 
activities students take on is a 
personal decision, but their ac-
tivities should be something that 
they enjoy and help them reach 
their full potential.  
   “Establishing yourself in a 
few activities that you truly care 

about and where you are able to 
enlist yourself in a leadership 
role says that you have the abil-
ity to commit to a task and take 
charge of it,” Carolyn Cutrone 
and Melissa Stanger from Busi-
ness Insider said.
   Getting involved is also a way 
for students to be productive 
in college because they are in 
a new and unfamiliar environ-
ment. They might feel hesitant 
to become active out of fear and 
uncertainty of putting themselves 
out there, but taking the first step 
is worth it. That step will give 
students an immense amount of 
exposure to opportunities that 
help them get more familiar with 
their surroundings.
   They are forced to break out 
of their comfort zone and get in-
volved by leaving their room and 
resisting the urge to only hanging 
out with people in proximity to 
them.  Extracurricular activities 
ultimately make students feel 
more in touch with themselves 
and their college experience.
   “[The important thing is] are 
you getting something out of 
it?” Brenzel asked. “Are you 
enjoying it? Are you learning 
how to do it better? Has it taken 
you some places that you would 
not otherwise have gone? If so, 
you’re fine.”

They Might Be Giants rock the Capital Region

   Having just released a new album on 
April 21, They Might Be Giants has 
begun touring all around the country. 
On their tour, the band stopped by the 
Capital District on Wednesday, April 22 for an energetic and eclectic 
performance at Upstate Concert Hall in Clifton Park. The alterna-
tive rock band played a mix of songs both old and new, but mainly 
focused on their new album “Glean.”
   The band is on a very difficult touring schedule, which involves 
touring cities from Philadelphia to San Diego in support of their 17th 
album. They will then travel back to Brooklyn for the last Sunday of 
every month to play a hometown show. 
   Having formed in 1982, the band has a mix of fans from all gen-
erations. The audience at Upstate Concert Hall consisted of all ages, 
from high schoolers to their parents’ generation. The venue does not 
offer a lot of space for dancing, but jumping up and down seemed to 
be enough for most. 
   

The band certainly let their weird 
sense of humor shine through during 
their set. They fielded a pair of fake 
phone calls from Siri, Apple’s digital 
assistant program. Singer/guitarist 
John Flansburgh turned his back to 
the audience and used a robotic voice 
effect on his microphone to make the 
“prank calls” to singer/keyboardist 
John Linnell. 
   During the second set, Flansburgh 
admitted to the crowd that calling 
Upstate Concert Hall an Albany 
venue is a bit misleading.
   “I honestly have no idea where we 
are,” said Flansburgh. The band later 
thanked “Mr. Cliff Ton Park, our 
benefactor,” for bringing them there.
   TMBG played a few fan favorites 
such as “Istanbul” and “Birdhouse in 
Your Soul,” but made some surpris-
ing omissions. Despite bringing up 
former Governor Nelson Rockefeller 
several times, and explicitly stating 
that they would play the song, they 
did not play their tribute to Albany’s 
roundest landmark “The Egg.” 
Popular singles from the band such 
as “Ana Ng” and “Don’t Let’s Start” 
were also left out of the set list.
   Leaving out some older material 
certainly helped them make the case 
for their newest album, which was 
available for purchase at their mer-
chandise table. New songs like “Underwater Woman” and “Answer” 
were received just as well as older material from the band. 
   After a pair of one hour sets and two encores, the band said their 
goodbyes by giving out hundreds of band stickers to the audience. 
The stage techs began taking everything apart, so that the equipment 
could be loaded and taken to their next stop at the House of Blues in 
Boston.
   The Brooklyn-based band found an early audience through their 
Dial-A-Song method of recording songs. The phone service, oper-
ated by John Linnell and John Flansburgh, originally ran from 1983 
to 2006. New songs would be recorded on a voicemail, which fans 

could call in order to hear new music. 
   TMBG brought back Dial-A-Song for 2015, as well as a website 
for hearing their new material. The songs are updated every week, 
which will mean 52 brand new songs planned for the year. The num-
ber for Dial-A-Song is (844) 387-6962.
   With the release of their new album, revival of the Dial-A-Song 
service, and successful national tour, They Might Be Giants is back 
bigger than ever.
 

Hollywood preps for summer with a rush of trailers

   The summer movie season is looming 
ever closer, and with “Avenger: Age 
of Ultron” set to kick things off on 
May 1, studios have recently been in a 
rush to release shiny new trailers for their biggest blockbusters in the 
hopes of playing in front of one of the largest audiences of the year.  
“Star Wars: The Force Awakens,” Disney’s other gigantic, pop-cul-
ture-dominating sequel in 2015, recently debuted its second trailer to 
an ecstatic fan response on April 16, but the days following that also 
saw new trailers for just about all of summer 2015’s heavyweight 
contenders, and one from a release as far off as 2016.  Here now is 
a look at some of these new trailers and what they reveal about the 
films themselves.
   “Ant-Man,” Marvel Studios’ emphatically small “Age of Ultron” 
follow-up got its second trailer, revealing more of the plot and char-
acters and also addressing the complaints many had with the first 
trailer.  This new look at the smallest Avenger’s debut film played 
up the humor, an element that was mostly lacking from earlier looks 
at the film, and the result was a much clearer vision of the action-
comedy tone that all involved promised the film would have. One 
stand-out comedic sequence in the trailer saw a beyond-bite-sized 

Ant-Man (Paul Rudd) going at it with 
a similarly small villain on a rattling 
train, which turns out to be a child’s 
Thomas the Tank Engine playset. The 
trailer also offered the first look at the 
film’s main antagonist, Yellowjacket 
(Corey Stoll) in motion, and provided 
a better impression of what the world 
will look like from the hero’s point-of-
view when small. All in all, it was a 
very promising look at what is shaping 
up to be a solid adventure
   On a less promising note, 
“Terminator: Genisys,” the franchise 
reboot that everyone seems to have 
accepted despite never having asked 
for it, dropped a new trailer that left 
fans and pundits scratching their 
heads. The usual business was there: 
alternate timeline, Emilia Clarke 
in badass-mode, bus chase, Arnold 
Schwarzenegger back in the cyber-
netic-saddle. But in addition to all 
that was a reveal that seemed to give 
away a massive and game-changing 
twist. In the interest of those wishing 
to remain unspoiled this twist will 
not be shared here, but suffice it to 
say that something is definitely not 
what it seemed to be, and the implica-
tions of this for the franchise past 
and present will almost certainly 
be huge, if not necessarily good or 
well thought out. Nothing else in the 
trailer indicated that the film would 
be anything more than a generic action flick, but it will certainly not 
be without some intrigue.
   The new trailer for “Fantastic Four” had perhaps the most heavy-
lifting to do as the film is such a huge departure from both the 
previous FF movies and most superhero films in general, and the 
previous trailer for the film left a lot to be desired in terms of char-
acter and detail.  To its credit, the second trailer gives a much better 
sense of who the titular team are as characters, showed how they 
will interact with each other, and for good measure threw in some 
humor. On top of all that, the extra time needed to finish up the 
visual effects allowed the new trailer to show off each character’s 
powers in action. Less interesting was the first look at the film’s 
new, weirdly-shiny version of Doctor Doom.  While the market-
ing for the film is finally starting to give a fuller idea of what it 
is, whether or not such a grounded take on a traditionally big and 
vibrant team of characters like the Fantastic Four is a good idea 
remains to be seen.
   Strangely enough, easily the biggest trailer unveiled recently was 
not for a film coming out this summer, or even this year. The debut 
teaser for “Batman v. Superman: Dawn of Justice,” the follow-up to 
2013’s “Man of Steel” and precursor to the rest of the DC Comics 
Cinematic Universe, dropped in advance of summer 2015, despite 
the fact that the film itself will not be in theaters until March 25, 
2016. When the fate of an entire line of giant blockbusters depends 
on one film making a billion dollars, maybe it makes sense to start 
the marketing push well in advance. The teaser itself is just that, a 

teaser.  Little in the way of plot is revealed beyond what can be gath-
ered from the title: Batman, Superman, they fight.  As many expect-
ed, the fallout from the last film’s destructive ending has a lot of the 
world against Superman, none more so it seems than Ben Affleck’s 
Bruce Wayne. Suiting up in a heavily armored version of the bat-suit, 
he goes to face a very angry looking Superman asking him, “Do you 
bleed?” before assuring him, “You will.”
   The film definitely looks to be continuing the darker tone set by 
“Man of Steel,” an artistic decision sure to please and frustrate audi-
ences in equal measure, just as its predecessor did. Given the fact 
that “Man of Steel” made a lot less money than the studio was hop-
ing for, continuing the franchise without any significant changes in 
approach beyond “Just put Batman in it” seems like a questionable 
way to go.  Will enough people turn up for another movie with a 
neck-snapping Superman?  Do audiences actually want a Batman 
who outright threatens to make his opponents bleed?  There is a long 
way to go before those questions are answered, and the first teaser 
does not give a lot of hope for the future.

Poetry at its finest
“Hawaiian Shirts in the Electric Chair”

   Scott Laudati, a budding author 
and poet, writes with wonder and 
passion. His collection of poems 
entitled “Hawaiian Shirts in the 
Electric Chair,” is easy to read and connect with. Readers don’t 
need to be expert readers or poets to enjoy his work and there is no 
need to analyze every word choice or combination. These poems 
are simply for those who love the written word in all its artistic 
forms. The first poem in line, “Can We Live Like This,” is written 
in an open-ended style, leaving the meaning up to the interpretation 
of the reader. It could be about a lover who fell out of love, or it 
could be a case of unrequited love. It could just be that the narrator 
is lamenting on the loss of a good friend, with no romantic feelings 
involved.
   Another poem in the collection is “The Dog Days Are Over.” The 
narrator seems to be commending his dog for being calm and stead-
fast in the face of uncertainty and danger. He seems to take solace 

in the anchor that is man’s best friend. He thinks about how simple 
happiness can be. While some may require expensive gifts and 
travels abroad to bring them happiness, all this narrator needs is the 
dog. When it comes to poetry, many of us assume that all poetry is 
about love and loss or anger. Laudati shows us how to appreciate 
poetry from all emotions and thoughts, not necessarily the most 
passionate and debilitating emotions.
   Throughout the book, the poems are told in first person to better 
help the readers to connect with the emotions and situations con-
veyed. The characters seem deep and thoughtful, but their words 
are vague enough so as to leave their thoughts and emotions some-
what interpretable. The poems are creative and fluid, changing from 
one feeling at the beginning to entirely new feelings at the end. 
They are complex enough to entertain, but not inaccessible. 
   It is a very good read, especially for those who enjoy reading 
but want something lighter than our textbooks. They are sad and 
beautiful, but sometimes filled with hope and promise. The book 
is engaging, thoughtful and inspiring, and funny. There are poems 
about dogs, UFOs, cocaine, friendship, love, bravery and time. 
Some are political and some are lighter. 
   Laudati expresses the idea of death in one of the most fearless 
ways. He is not trying to be a world-renowned poet, rather he is 
simply expressing his voice and thoughts for others to read and cri-
tique. His writing is brutally honest and unapologetic, he says what 
he feels and thinks no matter how raw and gritty it may seem. The 
theme seems to be connected to remaining innocence, a will to pre-
serve it, and a fear of losing it.
   “Putting the Art Back in Kmart” is about art itself and how 
destructive and beautiful it can be. Not all art can be held to the 
same standard as “beauty is in the eye of the beholder.” 
   We all find different forms of art pleasing. The compilation of 
poetry in “Hawaiian Shirts in the Electric Chair” is wonderful, both 
for those who already love poetry and for those who want to test 
the waters.

Jon Stewart leaves
 The Daily Show

   Jonathan Stewart 
is an American 
critic, political sati-
rist, writer, televi-
sion host, and stand-up comedian. Born November 
1962 in New York City, he and his family lived 
in New Jersey after his grandparents immigrated 
to the United States from Eastern Europe. In high 
school, Stewart was the victim of anti-Semitic 
bullying along with his older brother, Lawrence. 
Stewart graduated from the College of William 
and Mary in 1984, where he had been a member of 
the soccer team and had studied chemistry before 
switching to psychology. 
   After finishing school Stewart worked a number 
of jobs, one of which was as a bartender at City 
Gardens where he learned that he was not a “giant 
weirdo” and that “maybe there are other people 
who have a similar sense of yearning for some-
thing other than what they have now.”
Stewart made his stand-up debut at The Bitter 
End, the same place where comedian Woody Allen 
began his career. This is where Stewart changed 
his name from Stuart-Leibowitz to Stewart, due to 
pronunciation and an estranged relationship with 
his father.
   In 1999, Stewart replaced Craig Kilborn on “The 
Daily Show.” While the show discusses the politi-
cal climate and pokes fun at certain political fig-
ures, Stewart considers it to be nothing more than 
“schnicks and giggles,” rather than a political opin-
ion to be taken seriously. However much of the 
information on the show is factual, and is delivered 
in an informal and accessible manner. 
   Save for several temporary instances Stewart has 
been the sole host for 16 years, occasionally giving 
the chair to comedians like Stephen Colbert and 
John Oliver. Stewart has won a total of 19 Emmy 
Awards for his role as host. “The Daily Show” won 
two Peabody Awards in 2000 and 2004 for cover-
age of the presidential elections. 
   In September 2001, Stewart addressed the 

attack on the World Trade Center by forgoing the 
usual introduction to the show, which consisted 
of an aerial view of the Twin Towers. He instead 
lamented on the attack, which he dubbed an attack 
on “the symbol of American ingenuity, strength, 
labor, imagination, and commerce.” He did how-
ever, go on to say that “the view from the south of 
Manhattan is now the Statue of Liberty. You can’t 
beat that.”
   This February, Stewart announced that he would 
be leaving “The Daily Show.” This was later con-
firmed by the Comedy Central president, Michele 
Ganeless.
   Stewart is Jewish, although he doesn’t prac-
tice the religion. He is married to Tracey Lynn 
McShane, and the couple have two children, 
Nathan and Maggie Rose. They have a cat and two 
dogs named Stanley, Monkey and Shamsky respec-
tively. While Stewart has been labeled a Democrat, 
he considers himself “more socialist or indepen-
dent,” and has voted for Republican candidates in 
the past. He is an avid fan of the New York Giants 
and the New York Mets, and he also admires Bruce 
Springsteen.
   Stewart’s replacement is Trevor Noah, a South 
African political satirist, host, media critic, and 
comedian. He was born to a South African mother 
and a Swiss father, and his family suffered dur-
ing the era of apartheid. His ethical background 
and experiences are often a part of his routine. He 
began corresponding with “The Daily Show” in 
December 2014, and on March 30 2015, Comedy 
Central announced that he would be taking over in 
Stewart’s place. Although his selection has been 
met with some criticism, Noah shows confidence 
in his new role and describes himself, like Stewart, 
as a political progressive.
   In his farewell on “The Daily Show,” Stewart 
joked about how this was the longest he has held a 
job “by 16 years and five months.” He said it was 
time to give someone else the opportunity to run 
the show and that he had “a lot of things, got a lot 
of ideas in his head,” 
jokingly naming “dinner 
with my family” as one 
of them. 
   After thanking the 
crew of the show and 
joking around some 
more with the audience, 
Stewart showed the 
viewers “A Moment of 
Zen,” where a monkey 
washed a cat in a sink. 
While the relevance of 
such a clip shall be left 
to the viewer, it is clear 
with the audience’s 
reaction during his 
speech that he will be 
sorely missed. We can 
only hope that Trevor 
Noah lives up to the 
expectations.

Hardcore bands perform locally at The Low Beat.

   Seasoned Albany-
area promoter 
CR OM hosted a 
legendary show at 
Albany’s very own The Low Beat on Saturday 
April 11, to a band of thrash-hungry mutants who 
were foaming at the mouth by the time local trio 
Sick Mind took the stage. Although technical 
problems with the bass player’s amplifier cut their 
anticipated set short, they blitzed through numer-
ous tracks before calling it quits and clearing the 
stage for Montreal’s modern-day answer to 80s 
metal, Metalian. 
   The leather-clad Canadian rockers burst into a 
set of searing guitar-work, perfect falsettos and 
chest thumping drum-and-bass syncopation that 
encapsulated the 
crowd of vari-
ous patrons. Lead 
singer Ian Wilson 
was spotted on and 
off the front moni-
tors, belting guitar 
licks just before 
returning to his 
microphone to kick 
off another run of 
reverb-saturated 
vocals. 
   Bass player 
Andres Arango’s 
face could barely 
be seen through his 
long locks of jet 
black hair, as he 
pelted the audience 
with an onslaught 
of effortless bass 
work, all while 
head banging in 
unison with the 
tireless drumming of 
Tony Cantara. 
   Lead guitar-
ist Simon Costa, who looked oddly like Danny 
Masterson of “That 70’s Show” fame, was jumping 
between coordinating perfect melodic guitar-work 
with Wilson and intense solos of his own. It was 
surprising to see the strings hadn’t been literally 
shred off his guitar. 
   Metalian’s set consisted of almost all originals, 
including “Conquest” which is six-minute music 
epic of varying solos, tandem guitar harmonies and 
aggressively shifting rhythms. Vocalist/Guitarist 
Ian Wilson’s banshee-like vocals screamed “Just 
look at your men, how fearful and frightened; our 
time has come to move on…” as the band prepared 
for the next transition of the track. 
   They plowed through a quick-paced rendition 
of “Sonic Attack” and completed a couple ster-
ling takes of their new material off their latest EP, 
“Metal, Fire and Ice.” Completing their set after 
two bonus encore songs left the crowd hungry for 
Cleveland, OH natives Party Plates. 
   Hardcore music is nothing new to this quintet, 

who blasted into their set with the velocity of a 
fighter jet, hammering the audience with lively 
stage antics and relentless speed. The tireless 
crowd responded multiple times by inciting a circle 
pit, while the vocalist delivered the lyrics without 
skipping a beat. 
   Party Plates style is reminiscent of just about 
every relevant hardcore band in the past 30 years, 
including Bad Brains, Minor Threat and even some 
tinges of D.R.I. at times. The ferocity of their set 
completed the evening in perfect form and it was 
clear that the Albany crowd who had gathered had 
received quite a show for the $7 cover charged 
they gladly forked over upon entrance into The 
Low Beat. 
   Upon completion of the final pint of the night, it 

was clear that the Montreal metal troupe Metalian 
had stolen the show outright. Their presence on 
stage, complete ownership of their highly influ-
enced style, and perfect form put them ahead of 
the equally entertaining groups booked for the 
nights. 
   It was a shame that Sick Mind encountered 
some issues early on in their set, as the crowd 
would have loved to see more of their material in 
action; they’re definitely a local band to keep on 
the radar. 
   Party Plates was everything to love about hard-
core music, from the herky-jerky movements of 
the lead singer on-stage to the constant barrage 
of distorted sound issued by the guitar and bass 
player. Metalian however left a void after their 
set. Their music reeked of 80s heavy metal, their 
sound comparable to the likes of Iron Maiden and 
Judas Priest among others. Without a doubt, the 
Albany area needs more international acts like the 
earth shattering Metalian to grace us with their 
presence.

   The University at Albany base-
ball team (11-19, 5-6 AE) came 
into three game weekend series 
at Varsity Field against Stony 
Brook University (23-12, 12-2 
AE) with the hopes of challeng-
ing the Seawolves for first place 
in the America East standings. 
The challenge was denied as 
UAlbany fell three times to 
its top in-conference rival and 
remained in second place. 
    Saturday’s first game of the 
doubleheader could not have 
gone any worse for the Great 
Danes, who allowed 15 runs on 
18 hits by the Seawolves, in a 
15-3 beating. 
   “We did not pitch well in game 
one,” said head coach Jon Muel-
ler. “We knew it was going to be 
difficult sledding and we really 
struggled with our bullpen’s 
effort.” 
   Stony Brook opened up the 
scoring in the fourth inning with 
a two-run double by Andruw 
Gazzola that sailed over a diving 
Will Miller in deep left-center 
field to drive in the first two runs. 
Jeremy Giles followed with an-
other Stony Brook run in the fifth 
inning after hitting a sacrifice fly 
to centerfield, allowing Casey 

Baker to score from 
third. 
   With the bases load-
ed and one out, UAl-
bany responded with 
a two-run double into 
the left-center field gap 
by Shawn Blake to put 
the Danes within one. 
In the same half in-
ning, Trevor DeMerritt 
followed with an RBI 
groundout to tie the 
game at three. 
   The Seawolves 
lineup, however, 
would not let up the 
run production. Stony 
Brook ensued with two 
runs in the sixth, three 
runs in the seventh, 
four runs in the eighth, 
and three runs in the 
ninth, outscoring the 
Danes 12-0 over the 
final four innings.
   UAlbany’s starter, 
Brendan Ryan, was pulled after 
allowing five runs, four earned, 
on eight hits over 5.1 innings. 
Terry Dugdale, Sam DeCelle and 
Cameron Sorgie appeared in re-
lief from the Danes bullpen and 
surrendered a combined ten runs 
over just 3.2 innings of work. 
   Stony Brook’s Toby Handley 
led all hitters with four hits and 
three runs batted in, while Jack 

Parenty ended the first game with 
five runs batted in on two hits, 
including a three-run double in 
the ninth inning.
   Eight of Stony Brook’s nine 
hitters recorded at least one run 
batted in and all nine recorded at 
least one base hit apiece. 
   In game two, the Great Danes 
hoped to keep the scoring from 
the opposing side at a minimum 
with Stephen Woods on the 

mound. Fortunately for Stony 
Brook, starting pitcher Daniel 
Zamora went head-to-head with 
Woods deep into the game, al-
lowing just one run over four hits 
and seven strikeouts in Stony 
Brook’s 2-1 victory. 
   Woods got off to a quick start, 
striking out six batters over his 
first four innings of work.
   Zamora matched Woods and 
was even more dominant with 

seven punch-outs 
and no runs allowed 
over the first four 
frames.
   In the second in-
ning, Stony Brook 
brought home the 
first run of the game 
on a fielder’s choice 
groundout that al-
lowed Gazzola to 
score from third. 
   Two innings later, 
Woods struck out 
the first two batters 
he faced before giv-
ing up a solo homer 
to Gazzola that put 
Stony Brook up 2-0. 
   In the bottom half 
of that inning, Trev-
or DeMerritt stepped 
up to the plate with 
the bases loaded, but 
grounded out to the 
pitcher and stranded 
all three runners for 
the Danes.
   After lead off hits by Eric 
Mueller and Karson Canaday to 
kickoff the fifth inning, UAlbany 
had another opportunity to score 
with runners in scoring position. 
With one out and runners on 
second and third, Alex Luska-
vich hit a sacrifice fly to deep 
centerfield that allowed Mueller 
to score the Danes’ first run of 

game two. 
   But that would be all the run 
support for Woods’ outing of 
seven innings, two runs allowed 
on three hits, and seven strike-
outs. The Danes would strikeout 
ten times in game two and strand 
six base runners in the one run 
loss. 
   “You tell me your pitcher gives 
up three hits and strikes out 
seven guys over seven and you 
think you’re going to win that 
game, but [Stony Brook] pitched 
a little bit better than us,” said 
Mueller after the pair of defeats.
   “We had a tough time against 
these Stony Brook pitchers 
today. We didn’t protect the plate 
good enough and we failed to 
cash in with runners on base.”
   In the third game of their series 
on Sunday afternoon, Stony 
Brook continued the offensive 
onslaught, beating UAlbany 12-2 
to finish off a three game sweep. 
   After a doubleheader at NYIT 
on Tuesday, UAlbany will con-
tinue America East play at home 
for a three game series vs UMass 
Lowell this weekend.

Women’s Lacrosse pounds UMBC on Senior Day

BY KELSEY AUMAN

   The University at Albany 
women’s lacrosse team (13-3, 
5-1 AE) dismantled UMBC (8-8, 
3-3 AE) 20-5 this Saturday after-
noon in their final home game to 
improve to a 9-0 record at John 
Fallon Field. 
 This season marked the first 
time that UAlbany has been 
undefeated at home in Division 
I play. The win was a perfect 
ending to the afternoon, which 
had begun with an emotion-
ally charged senior recognition 
ceremony.
   UAlbany head coach John 
Battaglino is proud of his se-
niors, who have developed into, 
“elite players in this league,” as 
he said. He is impressed with 
their work ethic and the career 
they’ve had, but he was also 
quick to mention that they, “ 
have more [work] to do.”
   UAlbany carried momentum 
from the pregame ceremony into 
the first half of the game, open-
ing the scoring less than three 
minutes into the game with a 
goal by Maureen Keggins. Soon 

after, Rachel Bowles made it 2-0 
UAlbany on a free point shot.
   UMBC was able to counter 
with a goal after a long posses-
sion in the UAlbany zone, but 
they did not have an answer for 
UAlbany’s relentless attack. 
A goal by Bowles on the man 
advantage gave the Great Danes 
a 3-1 lead and began an eight 
goal rally. The Danes were able 
to build momentum due to six 
consecutive faceoff wins in this 
span, with contributions coming 
from several different players.
   The Danes built their lead to 
13-2 at the half, with contribu-
tions from Dakotah Savitcheff 
and Alie Jimerson. With Sav-
itcheff’s two goals in the first 
half, both assisted by Keggins, 
Savitcheff became UAlbany’s 
all time leader in single season 
goals. She passed Jodi Battaglia, 
who had previously held the 
record with 56 in 2011. 
   The second frame began with a 
tally from Bowles on a laser of a 
shot. The ensuing three goal run, 
led by Keggins, gave the Danes a 
commanding 17-2 lead.  A costly 
turnover forced by Michelle 
Primomo was able to negate a 
UMBC faceoff win and result 
in another goal for the Danes, 

this time by Jimerson. Goals 
by Rachel Bowles and Emma 
Powlin rounded out the scoring 
for UAlbany with five minutes 
left in the game.
   UAlbany’s defense was able 
to hold off UMBC thanks in part 
to the goaltending of Courtney 
Henderson, who finished with 
seven saves in her 13th win of 
the season.  UAlbany also had 

only 6 turnovers, their lowest 
number on the season.  
   Senior Maureen Keggins had 
a record-breaking day as she 
led the offense with six goals 
and five assists. She tied Rachel 
Burek’s record for most points 
in a single game with 11. With 
85 points on the season, Keggins 
also surpassed Rachel Burek’s 
previously held record of 84 

to become UAlbany’s all time 
single season points leader.
   Keggins said that, because her 
parents were in attendance for 
the ceremony, this game was a 
little more special than most.  
   “Our energy was really high,” 
Keggins said. “We left it all on 
the field.” 
   The seniors were able to main-
tain their composure throughout 
the game, which Keggins cred-
ited to their experience.
   Battaglino, whose squad has 
now set a program record with a 
total of 369 points on the season, 
was very proud of his team’s 
effort. “I thought it was a great 
way to honor our seniors, to have 
our kids play that well.”  
   He is confident in his squad en-
tering postseason play. No matter 
who they will be playing against, 
he said, “they’re not afraid.” 
   “They’ve played some of the 
top five teams in the country 
and they’ve all been couple goal 
games.”  To finish the regular 
season with a game like this, in 
which his team was, as he said, 
“firing on all cylinders,” certain-
ly can’t hurt either.
   With the win, UAlbany 
clinched the number two seed 
in the upcoming America East 

Tournament at Stony Brook. 
They will take on Vermont in 
the semifinals on Friday, May 1 
at 7:30 p.m.  The winner of that 
game will play Sunday at noon 
in the championship game on 
ESPN3.

   The University at Albany men's 
lacrosse team ended one of the 
most successful regular seasons 
in school history this past Sat-
urday at Bob Ford Field with a 
20-9 blowout win over America 
East conference rival UMBC.

   Last week, UAlbany defeated 
Yale in front of a record setting 
crowd of 4,283 in the school’s 
first lacrosse game at Bob Ford 

Field. On Saturday, 2,514 fans 
packed Bob Ford Field to see the 
Great Danes earn their sixth win 
in a row.
   Ranked seventh in the coun-
try, the Great Danes (13-2, 6-0 
America East) never relinquished 
a lead that started just 27 seconds 
into the game off of a Seth Oakes 
score.   
   The Great Danes' offense was 
clicking early and often in the 
first quarter as they scored 10 
goals in the opening quarter, two 
more goals then UMBC (5-8, 1-5 
America East) has given up on 
average for an entire game this 
season.
   The Great Danes seemingly 
had the game wrapped up at 

halftime, as they held a 15-2 lead 
after two quarters. Connor Fields 
paced the Great Danes with five 
goals in the first half, and Seth 
Oakes, Lyle Thompson Tim Cox 
each had four points at the half. 
  Thompson, who continues to 
pad his record as NCAA Divi-
sion I lacrosse's all-time leading 
points scorer, had the crowd on 
its feet with several spectacu-
lar plays, including a highlight 
reel finish against three UMBC 
defenders. 
   The Retrievers were held 
scoreless the entire second 
quarter as UAlbany’s defense 
held strong, frequently forcing 
turnovers. Goalie Blaze Riorden 
had another strong game, one in 
which his dominance allowed 
UAlbany to give backup goalie 
JD Colarusso significant playing 
time, following Riorden’s game 
saving efforts against Yale just a 
week ago.
   UMBC rallied in the fourth, 
scoring five goals in a row, 
primarily against UAlbany's 
backups. But the deficit was too 
much to overcome. The Great 
Danes capped off a dominant ef-
fort in which his team converted 
on 21 of 33 shots and won two 
thirds of the faceoffs.
   The Great Danes were led by 
five goals from Fields and three 
each by Thompson and Oakes. 
Coming off the bench, Tim Cox, 
Tom Nuckel, and Kyle McClan-

cy each scored a pair of goals. 
Pat Young scored three goals to 
lead for the visiting Retrievers.
   The Great Danes honored their 
10 graduating seniors on Satur-
day. The seniors will finish their 
careers as part of a UAlbany 
program that has changed the 
way lacrosse is played nation-
ally. The fast paced nature of the 
Great Danes is something coach 
Scott Marr recognized.
   "They really have seen the 
evolution of our program from 
the time they were freshman to 
where we are now and the pace 
that we do play and how it has 
affected the rest of the game," 
Marr said. 
   This team has made an impact 
nationally and Marr recognized 
the accomplishments of his de-
parting seniors saying that other 
college teams try to emulate the 
way the Great Danes play. 
   “We talked everyday about 
playing our standard,” Marr said. 
“[Our seniors] saw the older 
guys holding that tradition, and 
we want to play at that same 
level and intensity.”
   Marr's squad has the nation's 
most potent offensive attack, 
leading the nation with over 17 
goals a game. The Great Danes 
goals per game average is three 
more than the second place 
Syracuse Orange. Seth Oakes 
and Connor Fields both rank in 
the national top 10 in goals per 

game average with 
over three each.
  This year’s team 
stacks up well nation-
ally on the offensive 
end, and that’s not 
even mentioning Lyle 
Thompson, who has 
the second highest 
assist total in NCAA 
Division I history to 
go along with the most 
points.
   After wrapping up 
their third-straight 
perfect America East 
season and taking 
home the regular 
season championship, 
UAlbany will host the 
upcoming conference 
tournament.
  The Great Danes' 
next game will be 
this Thursday against 
Hartford at Bob Ford 
Field in the semi-finals 
of the America East 
tournament at 7 p.m.
   If the Great Danes 
defeat Hartford, they 
will play in the Amer-
ica East Championship 
game on Saturday, May 
2 at 10 a.m. against the 
winner of Thursday’s 
game between Vermont and 
Stony Brook. 
    

Men’s Lacrosse crushes UMBC to finish regular season

UMBC.............................9
UAlbany......................20

            UAlbany will host America East Tournament at Bob Ford Field. 

Playing for the red, white, blue, purple, and gold

   
   It’s 7 a.m. on a typical spring 
day at the University at Albany. 
The majority of college students 
are still sleeping after long nights 
of completing homework, study-
ing for exams, and socializing. 
   Freshman field hockey star 
Anna Bottino is doing all of the 
above. Except she’s awake at 7 
a.m. and ready to attack the day. 
   She usually starts the day with 
a 30 minute run by herself just to 
get the juices flowing for the rest 
of the day. After she is warmed 
up from the run, she goes im-

mediately to spring field hockey 
practice at the athletic complex. 
   If she feels she hasn’t had a 
satisfactory morning so far, she 
likes to stay after practice to 
work on her individual skills 
before heading to her two classes 
of the day. 
   By the end of her classes, it is 
between noon and 1 p.m., and 
she has accomplished more in 
her day so far than the prototypi-
cal college student will for the 
entire day.
   To put it bluntly, Bottino 
knows the keys to success, as 
evident by her accomplishments 
on and off of the field.
   This past season, Bottino was 

named America East Rookie of 
the Year after starting 22 of 23 
games for a Great Danes team 
that reached the Final Four in 
October. She earned Second 
Team America East honors, as 
well as a selection to National 
Field Hockey Coaches Asso-
ciation All-Northeast Region 
Second Team. 
   Despite her constant work in 
the offseason to improve, Bottino 
never expected the amount of 
success she and her team had in 
her first season at UAlbany.
   “I thought I was going to be 
starting on the bench. The quality 
of play was very high and I had 
to get used to it,” Bottino said of 
the transition to NCAA competi-
tion. “I was really nervous the 
first game, but the team helped 
me adjust. If you do something 
wrong, they let you know.” 
   UAlbany won the America 
East conference to qualify for the 
NCAA tournament. Their team 
wasn’t expected to go as far as 
they did simply because UAlba-
ny isn’t recognized as a national 
powerhouse in field hockey.
   The Great Danes defied the 
odds by beating powerhouses 
Wake Forest and Maryland 
before falling to UConn in the 
Final Four. Bottino says her 
favorite UAlbany moment so far 
was when the Great Danes upset 
No. 2 Maryland to advance to 
play Connecticut in the national 
semifinals. They were the first 
UAlbany team in any sport to 
reach the national Final Four. 

   “We played our hearts out 
versus Wake Forest. To beat 
Maryland, we knew we had to 
play our game and play the best 
we could,” Bottino said. “It was 
the best moment of my career 
when the buzzer went off and we 
beat Maryland.”
   The Danes would go on to lose 
1-0 in the Final Four to UConn. 
However, Bottino and her 
teammates are proud of putting 
UAlbany on the map this year 
and are excited for the upcoming 
season in the fall.
   ”We are losing four seniors. 
But we have a very good class 
of freshmen coming in that will 
definitely add depth. We are go-
ing to need to take it one game at 
a time,” said Bottino. 
   Before even thinking about a 

second consecutive trip to the 
Final Four, Bottino is making 
sure her and her teammates are 
focused on competing in the 
America East first and foremost. 
Stanford will join the America 
East next season, which will cer-
tainly make the Danes’ trip to the 
NCAA tournament even more 
difficult than this past season.
   And perhaps even more aston-
ishing than the several accolades 
mentioned, Bottino was nomi-
nated to try out for the Under-19 
USA Field Hockey team this past 
January. She made the team in 
March, and represented the USA 
in exhibition games in mid-April 
for one week in Belgium.
   “It was an amazing experience 
to wear my country’s uniform 
along with some of the best girls 

in the country,” Bottino said of 
her recent trip. 
   She will continue to go to the 
team’s practice facility in Penn-
sylvania for four to five days 
every month for the next few 
months for team workouts and 
practices. She says representing 
the United States in the Olym-
pics one day is definitely a dream 
of hers. Just as she doesn’t like 
to speculate about how far the 
Great Danes will go next season, 
she insists on taking that process, 
“one day at a time,” as well.

   The Tewaaraton Foundation 
has announced that University at 
Albany attackman Lyle Thompson 
has been named a Tewaaraton 
nominee.
   Thompson, a 2014 co-Tewaara-
ton Trophy recipient with brother 
Miles Thompson, was one of 25 
men’s players selected as Tewaara-
ton nominees.  The field of 25 will 
be narrowed to five finalists on 
Thursday, May 7, with the 15th 

Annual Tewaaraton Award Cer-
emony being held at the Smithson-
ian on Thursday, May 28.
   It is the third year running that 
Thompson has been named a 
nominee. He was one of the five 
finalists in each 2013 and 2014.
   Thompson currently leads all of 
Division I with 6.29 points and 
3.79 assists per game, tallying 35 
goals and 53 assists on the year for 
88 points. He became the NCAA 

all-time leading scorer in Divi-
sion I and has led UAlbany to a 
#7 ranking in the USILA Coaches 
Poll and Inside Lacrosse media 
poll, the team’s highest placement 
since 2007.
