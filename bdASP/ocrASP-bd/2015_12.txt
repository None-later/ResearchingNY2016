While details about the 
death of University at Albany 
student Johnny Paredes are 
still unclear, some students 
have taken to social media 
to remember his life.  The 
hashtag “#HelpFindJohnny,” 
was tweeted on Nov. 25 by 
14 people when Paredes was 
still missing. Eight of the 
posts shared the same picture 
with their tweet : an image 
of Johnny “J5” Paredes with 
text. “Johnny Paredes last 
seen Saturday. Left to NYC 
at 5:45 p.m. on trailway 

bus, phone is disconnected. 
Please dm me if you have 
any information about his 
whereabouts,” it said. 
Paredes’ body was found 
later that day, according 
to an incident report from 
the University Police 
Department. Aran Mull, 
Deputy Chief of UPD, 
explained that the university 
was checking with authorities 
to confirm a rumor. 
“We checked to ensure 
that the authorities there were 
talking with the family about 
it. Past that we stepped back,”

As the University at Albany continues 
its sprint forward to maintain its coveted 
“engine of opportunity” title, the school 
will quietly lose one of the features that 
makes it truly unique within the SUNY 
system at the end of December. The pipe-
smoking Podium Pat will retire on Dec. 30, 
after 27 years at the university.
Originally from Brooklyn, Patrick Hill 
has befriended countless students over his 
27-year career at UAlbany. He talked to 
students, he listened to students and, if they 
weren’t the chatty type, he gave them a 
friendly smile as they walked by him on the 
Podium. 
Pat, who can be found driving his 
red maintenance cart everywhere on the 
Podium, began his career at UAlbany as 
a clerk at the university bookstore where 
he worked for 10 years. He then switched 
to doing maintenance on the Podium. Pat 
said he switched because he loves the 
outdoors, and being outside gave him more 
opportunities to talk to students.

“I’m a talker. I like to talk,” he said.
Pat said he’s been trying to retire for 
three years, particularly during the long, 
gray winters, but he kept coming back 
because he enjoys the spring season on 
campus. His favorite place on campus is 
the East Garden, and he takes a lot of pride 
in keeping the Podium clean.
“The Podium is the living room of the 
university. It’s one room you want to keep 
clean,” he said.
Now, at 72, Pat has decided that it’s 
finally time to go. However, he won’t 
ever forget all his friends who took him 
to meet their parents at graduation and all 
his friends who chatted with him. He will 
never forget the students who thanked 
him for smiling every day, he said, and he 
wishes everyone the best of luck in their 
continued studies, their graduations, and 
their lives.
“I would like to take this opportunity to 
wish you all a goodbye. To President Jones, 
Student Association, faculty over the years 
who I’ve become friends with, and all the 
students. It’s been a real joy and it’s really 
kept me going, being able to speak to you 

and have you as my friends. You’ll always 
be in my thoughts and you’ll always be in 
heart,” Pat said.
I always knew who Podium Pat was, but 
I had never spoken to him prior to this story 
because I didn’t know how to approach 
him. As a journalism student engaging 
with strangers is something I’ve become 
less afraid of and I always saw Pat talking 
to different students, but the thought of 
speaking to him always made me nervous. 
What would I talk to him about? My 
problems? Who would care about the 
problems of one student out of 17,000?
As it turned out, Pat is the one who 
cares about the problems of one student 
out of 17,000. He talked to people about 
boyfriends, girlfriends, families, work, 
school, or anything else they wanted to 
talk about. For a few weeks while I was 
working on this story, Pat came to the 
newspaper office just to see how I was 
doing. I didn’t have to give him a grand 
answer about where my life was going and 
I didn’t have to pretend I knew what I was 
doing. I just talked, and he just listened. 
College students don’t have people who 

will listen to them anymore. They rarely 
have time to listen to each other. Under 
the crushing pressure of school, jobs, 
extracurricular activities and the dozens of 
other personal issues each student on this 
campus has to deal with, often, no one has 
time to say anything. More importantly, 
no one feels like they have anyone who 
is interested in their enormous struggles, 
which might seem mundane to any other 
person. Of course, there are places students 
can reach out to on campus if they feel 
overwhelmed or upset, but sometimes that 
might be too much. Sometimes the only 
thing a student needs is to stop and talk for 
five minutes.
During his career, Podium Pat was 
that person to many students. The act of 
encouraging college students to talk and 
to be open and kind to each other should 
not go away just because Podium Pat is 
moving on. It’s hard to find cheer on this 
huge campus sometimes. It’s easier to walk 
with your head down, but if we work at it 
and start by simply smiling at one another, 
we can continue the work Podium Pat did 
to brighten up this gray place.

Chemists at the University 
at Albany have found a way to 
narrow down a suspect pool in an 
investigation using bodily fluids 
left at the crime scene instead of 
waiting for DNA to return from the 
laboratory. 
Jan Halámek, an assistant 
professor in the chemistry 
department, along with his team 
of six undergraduate and graduate 
research assistants, designed a test 
which extracts the amino acids left 
behind in a fingerprint and allows 
not only forensic scientists, but 

potentially anyone, to determine 
the gender of the individual who 
left the fingerprint. By identifying 
the gender of a fingerprint left at an 
actual crime scene, professionals 
can shrink their suspect pool before 
the actual DNA results return from 
the forensics lab, which can take 
weeks or even months. 
To validate this process, the 
team created a crime scene and had 
three female volunteers leave their 
fingerprints along different surfaces, 
according to a press release from the 
UAlbany Media Relation’s Office. 
The chemists extracted the content 
left behind by the fingerprint sweat, 

isolated the amino acids and then 
analyzed them.
Halámek explained that a higher 
level of amino acids found in the 
sample indicates that the suspect is 
a female, while a lower level signals 
that the suspect is a male. 
The work done by Halámek 
and his group began a year ago, 
but this is just the beginning. They 
are writing grant proposals and 
looking for partnerships with other 
institutions so that they can further 
develop this technique. Their goal 
is to expand their population study, 
which will hopefully enable them

Carmela McNaught from Mastic, N.Y. 
is a senior at the University at Albany 
majoring in English. She is 22 years old and 
has been struggling with an eating disorder 
for nine years. She decided to finally open 
up and talk about her experience this year.
“I’ve always been a tall, bigger girl,” 
McNaught said. “I’ve always been insecure 
about that.”
During the summer of 2006, she decided 
she wanted to lose weight and look “good.” 
She began dieting and tried the “Special 
K challenge,” which replaces two regular 
meals with a bowl of Special K cereal. She 
lost 20 pounds quickly. 
“People kept telling me I looked good 
and I liked it,” McNaught said.
According to Dr. D. Catherine Walker, a 
licensed clinical psychologist and visiting 

assistant professor for Union College 
in Schenectady, N.Y., there is a social 
environment that sets up individuals who 
are predisposed to have concerns about their 
shape, regarding weight and disorders. 
   “There is an aspect where dieting is 
supported, fat talk is a cultural norm for 
women, and there is a negative stigma 
against those who are obese or overweight,” 
said Walker.
After continuing the diet for a few 
months, McNaught realized her body 
wasn’t functioning properly. She went 
to her doctor and was told she was 
underweight for her height. She was at her 
lowest weight at that time: 130 pounds.
“The worst part was, I didn’t think it was 
a problem,” McNaught, who is 5-foot-11, 
said. “I wasn’t phased, I didn’t get it. When 
you’re so consumed, you’re in denial. All 
I kept thinking was that I felt better when I 

was thinner.”
McNaught was then given the nutritional 
drink Ensure to help gain some weight 
back. By the end of that summer, she had 
gained 10 pounds. She maintained a healthy 
weight for a few years.
In August of 2012, she transferred from 
Suffolk County Community College to 
UAlbany to finish her college education. 
The following October, her father, James 
McNaught, was diagnosed with Hepatitis 
C and passed away that fall. She was very 
close with him and the loss hit her hard. To 
cope with her feelings, she started to binge 
eat.
Bulimia nervosa and binge eating 
disorder are two of the most common 
eating disorders, more than that of anorexia 
nervosa, according to Walker.
“I was not happy, I was out of control,” 
McNaught said. “I would hide the food in 

my room because I was so ashamed and 
embarrassed. I didn’t want people to see, 
it’s disgusting.”
To punish herself, she would restrict 
herself from eating after binging and work 
out excessively instead. She had hit her 
“rock bottom” this past summer.
“This summer was the skinniest I’d ever 
been,” she says. “I would look in the mirror 
and see my bones showing.”
This past summer, she decided to seek 
counseling. She realized that developing 
an eating disorder became her outlet for 
dealing with emotions and body image 
issues.
“My anxiety was really bad and it 
[eating disorder] was a reducer,” she said. 
“I noticed that my panic attacks stopped 
because that was my way of dealing with 
it.”

Depending on your major, finals week 
can be the most stressful time of the year for 
college students. This year it’s important 
to keep things on fleek when it comes to 
studying. Knowing the prime study locations 
during finals is key. Here’s a list of the best 
places to study around campus:
1

Libraries can be loud. Sometime your 
study group just needs their privacy. The 
best place for a quiet study group is in the 
Science Library group study rooms, known 
as “nerd rooms.” They can be reserved for 
free for three-hour intervals long as you 
bring a friend (study groups are for two or 
more people only). The Science Library is 
also a great place to study, as it’s normally 
not as crowded as the Main Library.

2 

Another hidden gem that not a lot of 
people know about is the Main Library 
basement. That’s another place to go if you 
need to work on a group project. It’s also a 
great place if you want to chat a little with 
your friends while you study. There’s a 
bunch of vending machines and bathrooms 
nearby, which we all know are necessities 
during finals week.

3 

There are many different help centers 
around campus that you can use if you 
need some assistance on school projects 
or papers. There’s a computer lab that 
you can go to through the Lecture Center 

filled with computers for work. Also in 
the Lecture Center is the campus ITS 
Services, that can help you with any 
technical difficulties. There’s also the 
Interactive Media Center in the Main 
Library basement. There, you can work 
on computers that have all your software 
needs: Adobe, FinalCut, Audacity, you 
name it. There are also people at the 
center to teach you how to learn all of 
these programs.

4 

Another great lifeline during finals 
stress are your teachers. Going to your 
teachers’ office hours is a great way to get 
the information you need straight from 
the source. Teachers don’t mind helping 
you either - they’re here for that reason. 
Some teachers offer extended office hours 
during finals week. Attending office hours 
gives you the chance to know exactly 
what your teachers expect and what kind 
of material they are looking for in texts 
and projects.

5 

If you can’t find that perfect study 
spot, roam through the halls and 
look for empty classrooms. Sometimes 
it’s great to study by yourself or with 
your study group in a room without any 
other interruptions. Just make sure there 
isn’t a class going on when picking your 
classroom. Also, if you’re studying in 
a classroom and someone comes in and 
says there is class, politely leave. It’s a 
common thing, so just go find another 
empty classroom.

Your college ID could save 
you up to 20 percent next time 
you’re shopping around or eating 
in downtown Troy, thanks to a 
Student Discount Program. 
The program, started in 2011 by 
the Troy Business Improvement 
District, gives students between a 
10 TO 20 percent discount at about 
49 local businesses ranging from 
restaurants to clothing stores to 
recreational classes. 
“I think the Student Incen-
tive Program is great because 
I’ve been able to get discounts 
at places downtown that I would 
never thought I could,” said Rachel 
Martin, a student at Russell Sage 
College. 
Some of the more popular stu-
dent hangouts that offer discounts 
are Plum Dandy on Sixth Avenue, 
which has buy-one, get-one-free 
frozen yogurt on Tuesdays and of-
fers 10 percent off every other day 
of the week; Spilln’ the Beans Cof-
fee House, which gives students 
10 percent off; and Muddaddy 
Flats Quesadillary, which offers 15 
percent off. 
According to Nationwide Mutu-
al Insurance Company, the average 
student only makes around $240 a 
week, so these small discounts can 
make a big difference. 
About 44 percent of Troy’s 
population is students and the city 
is trying to attract the 22,000 who 
go to school here.  
The downtown district has 
become a place where students 
frequently spend their downtime, 
so the city has decided to give stu-
dents an incentive to stick around.  
The list of businesses that 
participate is located on down-
town Troy’s official website: 
http://www.downtowntroy.org/
information-for-students/special-
incentives.html. 
However, students should first 
verify that the businesses on the list 
remain active participants. 
“Keeping this list updated is a 
significant part of our job, but a 
hard one to maintain,” said Elana 
Zinoman, an official spokesper-
son for the Troy BID. “We hope 
to have a fully updated list by the 
beginning of 2016. If business are 
going to make changes, we advise 
them to let us know.” 
Zinoman could not provide a 
figure regarding the amount of 
money the program brings in to 
the city and no other officials were 
available to comment. 
Most businesses that participate 
display a sticker on their doors or 
storefront windows that let students 
know if they provide discounts, but 
one problem students have come 
across is the lack of knowledge 
about discounts from the staff. 
This reporter recently tried to 
use her college ID at Bootlegger’s 
on Broadway.  The restaurant has 
the sticker on the front door, but a 
staff member told the reporter that 
they no longer give discounts. 
“I don’t know why they were 
denied,” said Nate Rock, owner of 
Bootlegger’s. “I’ll have to assure 
my staff that we still give students 
10 percent off.”

Jarius Jemmott grew up in a neighborhood where most 
kids didn’t attend college. With the support of strong mentors 
in his life, Jemmott not only attended college, he has used 
his college career to take leadership roles that allow him to 
change campus life and inspire youth to follow his path. 
Jemmott, 21, is the University at Albany’s Student Associ-
ation president, grew up in the north Bronx, N.Y. Jemmott has 
seven half-siblings, a sister and seven brothers. At an early 
age Jemmott was motivated by strong mentors in his life to go 
on to higher education. In kindergarten his father told him he 
would attend the prestigious Bronx High School of Teaching. 
Jemmott was a member of the wrestling team and toured the 
tri-state area competing in taekwondo tournaments. 
“My mom was always my biggest supporter. Everything 
I did she was in the front row,” he said. His mother’s uncon-
ditional support and his father’s disciplinary attitude molded 

Jemmott into the individual he is today. He graduated junior 
high school third in his grade and went on to attend one of 
New York City’s specialized high schools, the Bronx High 
School of Science. 
Jemmott is now a senior at UAlbany majoring in informat-
ics.
“Being the president is the biggest accomplishment I’ve 
had,” Jemmott said. He was elected president of the Student 
Association in March of 2014. His campaign slogan “Vote for 
Change” was more than just a slogan for him. 
“I wanted to be a leader, not just a president, I want to ad-
vocate for students who feel they aren’t heard,” he said. After 
getting involved with SA, he realized that his future would be 
in government. 
“I believe that I can make a direct change on people’s lives 
through working in the government, “ Jemmott said. 
President of SA is not the first leadership position he’s held 
since attending UAlbany. Jemmott is also heavily involved in 

Greek life at the university. He is president of the Delta Rho 
Chapter of Iota Phi Theta Fraternity Inc.  Besides being presi-
dent of his chapter, Jemmott was president of the National 
Pan-Hellenic Council Inc. and director of Fraternities on be-
half of the All Greek Council. He had to resign his position as 
president of the national Pan-Hellenic Council Inc. in March 
after he was elected president of SA. 
Jemmott intends to create a President’s Council with 30 
representatives elected by the presidents of SA groups on 
campus. The Council would unite all university groups and 
give them a way to directly engage in the law making process. 
Representatives would have a forum to express student’s 
concerns and provide their input to university officials.
Along with being the president of SA, Jemmott mentors 
students at the Albany School of Humanities. “One time, this 
teacher asked the students what they wanted to be when they 
got older, this one kid stood up and said when he grew up he 
wanted to be just like me,” he said.

COLLEGE OR HIGH SCHOOL?

ACADEMICS

The decreasing standards of the University at Albany

Mark Schmidt/UAlbanyphotos.com
The University at Albany is one of many colleges that has underrated its students capability and has constructed a curriculum that doesn’t challenge one’s learning.

By PAT GAREAU
A

t some point this semester, I realized I could get 
good grades with minimal effort. It may have been 
as late as mid-November when I slept through a 
quiz in the morning and my professor let me make it up 
without question, or it may have been as early as the first 
week when my statistics professor assured the class that 
everyone should do fine, regardless of their background in 
math.
This says much more about the University at Albany’s 
academic standards than about my particular ability as a 
student.
I transferred to UAlbany this fall from Hudson Valley 
Community College, where I was able to coast through 
classes and get good grades. I thought that was unique to 
community colleges, where the rate of students needing 
remedial education is sometimes more than 50 percent. 
What I’ve found is no significant leap in difficulty at this 
four-year research university that I commonly hear branded 
for excellence in academics.
To be fair, I am only in my first semester of my major, 
so perhaps I haven’t gotten to the challenging parts yet. 
Perhaps the lack of rigorous academics is limited to my 
majors of psychology and economics.
I think the more likely answer is that UAlbany is in lock-
step with the national trend in higher education of grade 
inflation and lower standards.
Studies have found that in the last 20 years, GPAs have 

gone up while the average amount of time spent studying 
has gone down. Some measures suggest that students aren’t 
learning a whole lot at college, and many surveys show that 
employers believe new entrants to the workforce are often 
inadequately prepared.
Going from an eyeball test after one semester at 
UAlbany, it looks to me like this would be an accurate 
assessment.
In many ways I appreciate the university’s leniency for 
subpar academics, as I’m sure many other students here do. 
I’m busy, so it’s really nice sometimes to know that I can 
skip classes and still do fine on quizzes with a quick review 
of the lecture slides the night before.
I’m also not too worried about the impact on me, 
personally, of what appears to be a common course model 
of catering to students that are either lacking the academic 
skill or unwilling to put in significant effort. I challenge 
myself in many ways outside of the classroom and make 
sure to learn independently. Thousands of students at 
UAlbany are doing the same and for people like that a 
lighter academic workload allows more time to be spent on 
passions.
But what about the students who need to be challenged 
academically? They will cut corners in class and do nothing 
on their own to cultivate personal and intellectual growth 
while in school. There are surely many students like that 
here as well.
There are a few options for the university if a big 
chunk of the student body is leaving here without a lot 

of intellectual growth because of middling academic 
standards. 
One of these is just to be honest. If UAlbany just markets 
itself as a place where the motivated can find challenging 
opportunities in research and high level courses, plus the 
slackers can get by too, then maybe we’ll see the spike in 
enrollment that the administration is looking for. In any 
case, stop spreading the myth that students will have to 
spend two hours outside of class for every hour in class. 
That is simply not true in most cases, and may dissuade 
students from pursuing work or extracurricular activities.
Another option, and one that I would suggest, is that 
UAlbany tell all departments that we’ll be moving to a 
more rigorous academic standard. Over the course of a 
few years, consciously make all courses more difficult. At 
the same time, make it easier for students to receive more 
credit for the productive things that they do on their own. 
Lots of activities develop skills as much or more than 
sitting in a lecture: working, being active in student 
organizations, or self-directed research, to name a few. By 
doing this, students could take four challenging courses and 
still receive 15 credits or more per semester by being active 
outside of class.
As I sit in my class on this Friday morning writing, not 
paying attention whatsoever to the lecture that my professor 
is giving about something related to economics in the 
developing world, one thing is clear: Something needs 
to be done to change the way academics are dealt with at 
UAlbany, and everywhere else.

Usually around late October 
and November, temperatures are 
very low and people are already 
taking the tunnels. But this year, 
during the colder months, there 
have only been 11 days where 
the temperature has been below 
50 degrees, compared to last 
year where there were 23 days 
according to accuweather.com. 
The lowest temperature Albany 

has reached this year was 39 
degrees on Nov. 30. 
The sun shining on random 
fall days makes the day feel less 
cold than it should be. These 
days are filled with students only 
shorts and a sweatshirt, thinking 
that summer and early fall 
weather is still upon us. These 
days are soon to be over.
Recently, it hasn’t been as 

cold as everyone at UAlbany 
expected coming into the 
semester. The weather has been 
pretty unbelievable.        
Upperclassmen know how 
cold this place can get, and 
even though it has been cold, 
the underclassmen don’t know 
what’s coming to them. 
Coming to UAlbany, new 
students most likely assume 
that it will get cold, but one 
never really knows how cold it 
can get until one experiences 
it. I remember my orientation 
assistant during my freshman 
year telling me how cold Albany 
can get and how early it hits. At 
first I didn’t believe him because 
the weather during the 2014 fall 
semester wasn’t terrible. But 
when late October hit, I brought 
up all my winter clothes.
The weather this year has been 

bearable - not really cold enough 
to justify taking the tunnels from 
class to class. Freshmen can be 
eager to know when the first 
snowfall of the year will happen, 
but trust me, it isn’t as enjoyable 
as it sounds.
Snow can be all fun and 
games for everyone, until you’re 
walking from your dorm room 
racing to get to the tunnels with 
snow flurries blowing into your 
face. The snow makes walking 
the simplest, shortest distances 
much harder than they need to 
be. The snow can also make you 
contemplate your every step 
when walking from destination 
A to destination B, thinking 
“why did I ever leave my dorm 
room,” or “the things I would do 
right now to go to a school down 
south.”
The only thing worse than 

the snow here at UAlbany is 
when the temperature gets low 
and the windchill is not exactly 
“chill.” Like the snow, when 
it is freezing and there is wind 
blowing in your face, winter 
quickly goes from your favorite 
holiday season to the top of your 
most-hated list. 
There is a solution to the 
winter woes, however. The 
tunnels can be your best friend 
during the winter season. The 
tunnels keep everyone toasty 
and warm, and become most 
peoples’ main path when going 
to different places on campus. 
Some may complain that the 
tunnels are too hot, especially 
when you’re bundled up, but I’m 
sure those students would rather 
be walking in the tunnels than in 
the freezing cold.

T

he University at Albany has been 
experiencing some strange weather 
recently. By strange, I mean that it hasn’t 
snowed all that much this semester. That’s 
something everyone at UAlbany isn’t used to by 
this time of year.

getting treatment they need.

O

n Nov. 27 an 
anonymous war 
veteran, only 34 years 
old, jumped to his death from 
the top of the parking garage 
of the Albany Stratton V.A. 
Hospital around noon. He had 
just been discharged from the 
hospital a few days prior.  
   On Black Friday, a day 
usually reserved for holiday 
shopping or spending time with 
family, this man chose to go to 
the roof of the 10-story parking 
garage and end his life.
   Unfortunately, this tragedy is 
common. 
   It’s a sad reality that veterans 
have an incredibly high rate 
of suicide. In a study done in 
2012 by the U.S. Veterans’ 
Association, it was found that 
every day 22 veterans commit 
suicide in the United States. 
   Annually, that number stacks 
up to an incredibly high 8,008 
suicides in total. The national 
total number of suicides so far 
in 2015 is 38,364, meaning that 
veterans alone make up about 
20 percent of all suicides that 
happen in the United States 
annually. 
   War is a terrible thing. 
Seventeen percent of veterans 
have Post-Traumatic Stress 
Disorder (PTSD) according to 
a 2014 study. The programs 
in place to help veterans are 
horribly lacking and don’t do 
nearly enough to help them get 
through the mental problems 
that war and the military cause.
   PTSD is caused by residual 
stress from traumatic and 
stressful situations, so it makes 
sense that war veterans would 
have a significantly higher 
rate of PTSD than many other 
demographics. 
   Out of the 17 percent of all 
war veterans who have PTSD, 
only 25 percent of them get 
care that is deemed “minimally 
adequate.” The rest do not seek 
help. 
   The majority of war veterans, 
people who have served this 
country and put themselves 
in dangerous situations, can’t 
even get quality care for the 
problems caused by their 
bravery. Many people go into 
the military expecting to serve 

their country, but they don’t 
realize that their country might 
not help them back when they 
when they need it. 
   The Veterans’ Affairs Center 
also gave an incredibly lacking 
response to the death of the 
nameless Albany veteran. It 
said it was “saddened to learn 
of the loss of a veteran,” and 
brought attention to its own 
suicide prevention hotline. 
   From a center whose main 
objective is helping veterans, 
the reply seems impersonal 
and cold. The section of 
the Veterans Affairs Center 
dedicated to PTSD is easy to 
navigate and find information, 
including well labeled videos 
with clear audio, such as 
“Understanding PTSD.” 
   The information is there, but 
there is no push for veterans to 
find it. From the low numbers 
of veterans that find their 
care and treatment for PTSD 
satisfying, one can assume 
there is no real emphasis put 
on it.
   The veteran from Albany is 
one casualty from a problem 
that continues to grow. It will 
only continue to do so until 
there are serious changes in 
the way the military and the 
Veteran’s Association treats 
PTSD and mental illnesses in 
general.

P

eople have a right to 
their opinions, but 
when their opinions 
result in death, it is no 
longer respected. 
   Lewis Dear had no right to 
kill three people at the Planned 
Parenthood in Colorado 
Springs, Colo. His actions 
transitioned him from a person 
who is pro-life to a terrorist. 
Even those who are pro-life did 
not see his deed as an act that 
was justified or necessary.
   “I think there’s a lot of belief 
that this qualifies as a form 
of domestic terrorism,” said 
Planned Parenthood’s Chief 
Experience Officer Dawn 
Laguens.
   Even the conservative 
presidential candidate Mike 
Huckabee called Dear’s act too 
extreme. 
   “What he did is domestic 
terrorism, and what he did 
is absolutely abominable -- 
especially to us in the pro-life 
movement, because there’s 
nothing about any of us that 
would condone or in any 
way look the other way on 
something like this,” he said. 
   Dear is an extremist who 
deemed his opinions as superior 
and sought to punish those 

who went against him. From 
his previous charges, such as 
his domestic violence charge 
against his wife in 1997 and 
charge for being a peeping tom 
in 2002, it can be concluded that 
he lacks some rationality.
   Dear is an example of a 
person who hasn’t come to 
terms that other opinions exist. 
This society is divided between 
pro-life and pro-choice. No 
matter what, neither is going 
anywhere, so we might as well 
just live in this society and 
acknowledge that there is more 
than one opinion.
   Lewis Dear claimed Planned 
Parenthood is just “baby 
parts.” But the organization 
goes beyond abortions. It’s 
an educational facility that 
specializes in sex. It’s a place 
that provides contraceptives 
and helps women to prevent the 
need of abortion. It even helps 
men with sexual problems. 
If woman wants an abortion, 
Planned Parenthood is there for 
more support and resources. 
   Planned Parenthood is a 
woman’s best friend, as this 
institution caters to situations 
specialized for women.
   Once we acknowledge and 
embrace women’s inherent 
deserved rights, rights which 
they should have had since the 
beginning, we will be a more 

humane and just society.
   Yet if humans have a right 
to do as they please with their 
body, why should abortion be 
excluded?
   Abortion is not something that 
I would personally encourage, 
however if a person chooses to 
do so, so be it. I would strongly 
encourage being cautious 
during intercourse, utilizing 
contraceptives and being 
mindful of what can happen 
during sex. Yet who am I to 
dictate another person’s sex 
life?
   I’m purposely disregarding 
the scientific evidence of 
when a fetus is considered 
alive or the benefits stem 
cells have. That argument can 
go back and forth forever. 
I’m strictly coming from the 
perspective that women have 
been acknowledged as humans, 
and just as men can ejaculate 
millions of potential humans, a 
woman can take control of her 
body.
   More so, a woman has a 
say on whether she wants to 
carry something in her for nine 
months, and those who are not 
her shouldn’t have a say. They 
aren’t carrying it for her. 
   At the end of the day, it’s all 
her choice.

I hope that this article doesn’t offend anybody, but with 
everything going on in our country and in the world, we can 
just shut that out. 
I say to hell with “safe spaces” at the university level. By 
initiating “safe spaces” on college campuses, the discourse 
on racism, classism, sexism, and more are stunted.
I shouldn’t feel uncomfortable using the word “black” 
or “white” in an academic setting because it is deemed 
politically incorrect.
An article for the National Review explains this concept 
best when writer Charles C. W. Cooke says, “A visiting 
speaker is skeptical of ‘rape culture?’ She’s a ‘threat.’ The 
College Republicans aren’t sure that Caitlyn Jenner is a 
woman? That’s ‘violence.’ Someone in your philosophy 
class disagrees with your politics? They’re literally 
imperiling your ‘safety.’”
I speak on this because the ability to have an opinion on 
an issue, whether the greater public agrees or not, should be 
granted to an individual. Not every opposing viewpoint is 
an individual attack on a culture, race or gender.

Hannah Oh, Steven Glick, and Taylor Schmitt, editors 
at the Clermont Independent at Claremont McKenna 
College, wrote in a recent article, “College is the last place 
that should be a safe space. We come here to learn about 
views that differ from our own, and if we aren’t made to 
feel uncomfortable by these ideas, then perhaps we aren’t 
venturing far enough outside of our comfort zone.”
Students need to be comfortable enough to speak their 
opinions freely without getting major backlash for it. It 
seems as though not much can be said without offending 
somebody. As an institution, however, it is important 
to figure out what is appropriate to say and what is 
inappropriate to say. In a classroom setting, people should 
not be offended when someone brings up racial cultures, for 
example. 
Of course, I would never say that people can be overtly 
rude or offensive, and claim it as free speech - that would 
be insane. I would never encourage racism or sexism or any 
similar idea.
Peoples’ ideas should not be hindered or hidden due 
to the possibility of it being offensive. Today’s society is 
becoming far too politically correct to the point where we 

can’t really say anything at all. 
The idea of a “safe space” should mean that students feel 
physically safe on their campus - that they can walk across 
campus and feel like they aren’t in danger, they won’t be 
antagonized by a factor that they can’t control outside of 
the classroom, and they won’t  be victims of assault in any 
form. 
A “safe space” is not one that censors someone’s 
opinion within the classroom that gives way to discussion 
or enhances an understanding of the subject that is being 
talked about. There are issues going on in the world and 
they do need to be addressed, on campus and off, but not 
every response to these issues comes from a malicious or 
hurtful place.
I just wish that the maturity level on college 
campuses would rise so that as college students we 
could appropriately assess the topics and protests going 
on regarding racism, sexism and different cultures and 
backgrounds. 
And again, I am not writing this piece to offend anybody, 
but at the same time I will not be censored just because 
someone, somewhere will be offended by the things I say.

Are campus ‘safe spaces’ too safe?

‘A CHRISTMAS STORY: THE MUSICAL’  
COMES TO THE CAPITAL REPERTORY 

By TENDRINA ALEXANDRE 

The Capital Repertory Theatre is hosting “A 
Christmas Story: The Musical” which will be 
showing until Dec. 27. It opened to a packed theater 
on Tuesday, Dec. 1 after a weekend of previews. 
The show, based off the 1983 classic film, “A 
Christmas Story,” takes place in the 1940s and 
follows the life of Ralphie Parker (played by Jake 
Goodman), a 9-year-old boy from Indiana. Ralphie 
is on a quest to obtain the most epic Christmas 
gift: an Official Red Ryder carbine-action 200-shot 
Range Model air rifle.
Narrated by an older Ralphie (Kilty Reidy), the 
audience is taken on an exciting journey through the 
boy’s life and vivid imagination. The story is colored 
with a series of dance numbers, hilarious lines and 
an overall perfect portrayal of the holiday season in 
the ’40s. Ralphie’s story entices memories of one’s 
own childhood, and his desperate attempts to receive 
his only Christmas wish is beyond relatable. 
Spoiler alert: this cast is a force to be reckoned 
with. They are fun, witty, character-conscious and filled 
with an unique energy. Ralphie’s mother, played by Julia 
Burrows, pulls at heartstrings in the most warming way. 
Her relationship with her father, Gary Lindemann, turns 
the theater into a love-driven home filled with lessons 
and happiness. Let’s not forget about Kara Mikula who 
plays Ms. Shields, Ralphie’s teacher. Her endless energy 
and serious spunk were a large percentage of the humor 

provided throughout the show. 
The kids in the show were phenomenal. Ranging from 
eight to 15 years of age, these Capital Region talents 
brought a spirited vibe to the play. Their impressively 
crisp voices and tapping toes left the audience in awe. The 
show belonged to them, and they are certainly a new and 

exciting light that all in the city should be a part of.
The play is a proper message about the importance of 
family and love. Ralphie’s crazy experiences speak to the 
child in all of us. As we watch his attempts to “stay good” 
before Christmas, while subtly reminding his parents of his 
only wish, we begin to share his same hope.

Topics like gender, rape, sexuality, 
abuse and post-traumatic stress disorder 
(PTSD) are often sidelined in live-action 
superhero films due to their sensitive 
nature. However, Marvel is finally 
addressing those topics upfront with its 
latest effort, “Jessica Jones,” based on the 
comic book character of the same name.
With all 13 episodes released on 
Netflix on Nov. 20, the series revolves 
around Jessica Jones (Krysten Ritter), a 
superhero-turned-private-investigator, who 
is forced to take action once again when 
an enigmatic, villainous figure named 
Kilgrave (David Tennant) returns to Hell’s 
Kitchen, N.Y.  
The series, created by screenwriter 
Melissa Rosenberg, is Marvel’s 
second collaboration with Netflix after 
“Daredevil” (2015) was released back in 
April to critical success, both of which 
encourage binge-watching. It is also the 
second effort in the Marvel Cinematic 
Universe (MCU) to have a lead female 
protagonist, after ABC’s “Agent Carter” 
(2015) came out in January, but Jones is 
nonetheless the first true superheroine to 
lead her own series.
While Jones has superhuman strength 
and flight abilities, Kilgrave can verbally 
control people to do his bidding. 
Kilgrave’s power may initially sound 
clichéd and even cartoonish, but it’s 
proven to be extremely dangerous as he 
often uses it to compel innocent victims to 
satisfy his selfish needs, treating them as 
slaves.
Marvel uses Kilgrave’s power to help 
darken the series’ tone as he verbally and 
physically abuse his victims. Examples 
include forcing an old man to throw hot 
coffee into his own face, instructing one of 
Jones’ neighbors to slit his own throat and 
making Hope Shlottman (Erin Moriarty), 
a New York University student, shoot her 
own parents. 
As a result, Jones, whom Kilgrave 
already victimized prior to the season, 
remarks that Kilgrave literally “leaves a 
trail of broken people behind him.”
Jones suffers from PTSD as she reveals 
that she was mind controlled, raped, 

manipulated and forced to murder an 
innocent woman under Kilgrave’s orders. 
Throughout the season, Jones suffers from 
vivid and haunting flashbacks to when 
Kilgrave abused her and she eventually 
decides to stop Kilgrave once and for all. 
Although there are no rape scenes in the 
first half of the season, Marvel already has 
pushed the envelope by mentioning rape 
alone.
Another new topic Marvel tackles 
is sexuality with attorney Jeri Hogarth 
(Carrie-Anne Moss), who is the first 
lesbian character ever in the MCU. Known 
originally as Jeryn Hogarth in the comics, 
her sex and sexuality change for the live-
action series also challenges the negative 
stereotypes associated with lesbians as she 
dresses in feminine outfits, wears makeup 
and is not a tomboy.
Gender is also brought up as Ritter’s 
portrayal of Jones does not conform to 
female gender stereotypes. She never 
really wears overtly feminine clothes, 
constantly uses foul language, is very 
assertive and frequently drinks alcohol. 
Her defiant no-nonsense and unapologetic 
attitude contrasts her from the more 
mainstream superheroes like Spider-Man 
and Superman. Jones’ persevering nature 
also connects with audiences, particularly 
with real-life viewers who have personally 
suffered from abuse, PTSD or rape. This 
makes Jones a more human character with 
flaws that differ from how superheroes are 
often perceived as ideal and perfect beings.
As the series is stretched into 13 
episodes, viewers are given more time to 
watch characters grow, understand their 
individual backstories and realize that 
there are comic book heroes and villains 
who, at the heart of it all, are still humans 
with faults. Doing all these things is harder 
in a single two-hour MCU film because 
viewers are given limited time to connect 
with the film’s characters and MCU films 
often favor action sequences over in-depth 
characterization.
While a second season has yet to be 
confirmed, the first season is currently 
available for streaming on Netflix.

Marvel’s 
‘Jessica Jones’ 
bravely tackles 
many topics

By RUSSELL J. OLIVER

Most Seth Rogen comedies are usually 
full of stoners who end up in comical 
hijinks they have to get themselves out 
of. Numerous Rogen-fueled movies have 
similar tropes, such as “Knocked Up” 
(2007) and “Pineapple Express” (2008). 
His new movie, “The Night Before,” 
doesn’t vary, but it does come with more 
Yuletide joy and Christmas flare.
Rogen stars as Isaac, along with Joseph 
Gordon-Levitt as Ethan and Anthony 
Mackie as Chris. Ethan’s parents died 
when he was young on Christmas Eve, 
which leads to a tradition of the trio of 
friends going out every year. As they grow 
older, this becomes difficult with Chris’ 
exploding athletic career and Isaac’s 
pregnant wife nearing her delivery date. 
Ethan agrees with them that this will be 
their final year.
Jillian Bell, best known for her role 
on “Workaholics” (2011-present), 
plays Betsy, Isaac’s wife. On their last 
Christmas Eve of going out, Betsy gives 
Isaac a box filled with different drugs so 
he and his friends can have one last crazy 
night together.
Of course, the trio runs into tons 
of crazy characters on their night out. 
Lizzy Caplan, from “Masters of Sex” 
(2013-present), plays Diana, who is a love 
interest to Ethan. Ilana Glazer, who plays 
one of the two queens from “Broad City” 
(2014-present), plays Rebecca, a girl with 
Grinch-like qualities. Notable stars such 
as Michael Shannon, Mindy Kaling and 
Miley Cyrus also encounter the boys on 
their night out on the town.
Ethan tries to keep the others focused 
on enjoying their last night out together, 
but Isaac keeps worrying about his 
family responsibilities and Chris is more 

concerned about his social media fans. 
After the trio has a few drinks and a 
couple of drugs, Isaac starts to freak out, 
even more so when he realizes he swapped 
phones with Mindy Kaling’s character.
Rogen, as the paranoid and eccentric 
Isaac, is the comedic highlight of the film. 
Isaac has numerous freak-outs throughout 
the night and his drug-induced anxious 
persona is hilarious to watch. At one point 
in the night, he has a vision into the future 
where his adult daughter is working as a 
stripper, while his wife, Betsy, shockingly 
eggs her on.
Eventually, Isaac runs away in a panic 
to find his phone and Chris runs away to 
catch Rebecca, who stole the gang’s weed. 
Ethan, angry at his friends, gets into a 
fight with two Santas.
The trio meets up again and argues 
about the distance that’s been created 
between them. This feels true to a lot of 
friendships that are struggling to stay 
intact when the life gets in the way. While 
the mishaps that take place during the 
night are over the top, the relationship 
between Ethan, Isaac, and Chris are 
accurate depictions of many friendships 
nowadays.
The gang forgives each other and 
reunites for one last party. Before the 
night is over, the film shows a flashback 
of Ethan on the night of his parents’ death. 
Isaac and Chris comfort him, convincing 
him to go out and enjoy their Christmas 
Eve together. The actors all play their 
younger selves, which sentimentally 
shows the viewer the beginning of this 
tradition.
“The Night Before” is definitely the 
kind of movie you should see in theaters 
with your best buds. The film was released 
nationwide on Nov. 20 and is currently 
playing in theaters.

Hillel and Shabbos House hosted Shabbat 360 to bring 
the Jewish community on campus together and to welcome 
in the non-Jewish community on Friday, Dec. 4. The 
massive Shabbat dinner was open to all and was held at 
the Campus Center Ballroom. There was plenty of food, 
great company and laughs. The Albany Student Press had 
the opportunity to interview Hillel President David Schnall 
and L’Chaim President Grant Hilsenrath, the masterminds 
behind the event.

ASP: What exactly is Shabbat 360?
GH:  Shabbat 360 is “mega-Shabbat” where different 
Jewish groups are trying to bring together the whole Jewish 
community at UAlbany. Our goal is to get 360 student[s] 
to come to this awesome Shabbat meal at the Campus 
Center.

ASP: What is the most important part about this 
program to you?
DS: It allows Jewish students who do not normally come 
to Shabbat dinner a chance to see what we do every Friday, 
while also allowing them to make new friends at the same 
time.
GH:  It’s definitely the possibility of reaching Jewish 
students who wouldn’t have otherwise come to any other 
Jewish event during their time here. 

ASP: What is the significance of 360?

DS:  Shabbat 360 is very significant because it is showing 
the UAlbany community that although we are labeled as 
Jewish groups on campus, we allow anyone to join our 
events.
GH:  The significance of Shabbat 360 is that it is an event 
like no other. UAlbany has never had an event like this and 
we intend to break some records. This is a chance for every 
Jewish student to feel more welcome than ever and come 
for a night of good food, good atmosphere, and general 
fun.

ASP: Would you do more events like this in the future?
DS:  I would love to do more events like this in the future 
because it will allow new students to see what the Jewish 
groups on campus can do when we collaborate on an idea.
GH:  I would love to make this an annual event. I would 
like to transform it into Shabbat 500 somewhere down the 
line and try to bring in at least 500 students.

ASP: What inspired this event?
DS:  This event has been something that I have always 
wanted to plan ever since I was the Public Relations Chair 
for Hillel my sophomore year. From talking to past Hillel 
presidents, I came to understand that not only was this 
something that they wanted as well, but it was something 
they tried to set in motion the day they were elected.

ASP: What message, if any, would you send to the 
student body?
DS:  If I could send a message to the student body, I would 

say: don’t feel discouraged from coming to any of our 
events, we are an open community that wants the entire 
UAlbany campus to enjoy our events.
GH:  I would say: “Just come!” The event will have an 
amazing atmosphere. Do not be intimidated for any reason. 
Whether you have practiced Judaism at home, just know 
you’re Jewish, or aren’t even Jewish and are just curious, 
just come! It will be a great event with great people. You 
have nothing to lose and everything to gain.

FILM REVIEW

Shabbat 360 brings students together

By NICOLE WALLACK

The word gangster often elicits images of 
bootleggers in Chicago in the 1920s and people like 
Vito Corleone ordering hits on rivals in New York 
City. Possibly the furthest from most people’s minds 
at hearing the word gangster is London in the 1960s. 
“Legend” shows that crime and gangsters are just 
as at home in London in the 1960s as they are in 
any dimly lit backroom of an Italian restaurant in 
America.  
“Legend” is a biopic of the Kray twins — vicious 
killers from the East End of London. Reggie Kray and 
Ronnie Kray (both played by Tom Hardy) ruled London 
for years, controlling clubs and casinos and even 
getting involved with the American mafia. Ronnie and 
Reggie, despite both being self-proclaimed gangsters, 
were as different from each other as could be. Ronnie 
was mentally unstable, paranoid schizophrenic, and 
openly homosexual at a time when being so was illegal. 
Reggie on the other hand, was suave, a ladies man, and 
the more likeable of the twins. According to the film, 
the twins were untouchable by Scotland Yard for years 
aside from small inconsequential sentences. The Krays 
were able to practically flaunt their organized crime 
because Ronnie ran something of a homosexual brothel 

in his apartment that a Member of Parliament attended. 
In order to prevent bad publicity and the necessity of 
arresting a Member of Parliament on homosexuality 
charges, Scotland Yard stayed out of the Kray brothers’ 
way until they could arrest them on serious charges 
which ended up being a murder charge for each 
brother. 
The differences between the brothers are really what 
show how extraordinary Hardy’s acting is in this film. 
The manic behavior of Ronnie juxtaposed with the 
easy elegance of Reggie shows just how comfortable 
Hardy is playing a variety of roles. Hardy wonderfully 
plays both roles, interacting with himself in an entirely 
natural and brotherly manner. 
In addition to the exquisite acting, the film is 
also rather artfully crafted. The film is narrated by 
the physically abused and neglected wife of Reggie, 
Frances (played by Emily Browning), who gives a more 
human perspective on the vicious Krays. She explains 
how she fell in love with Reggie and her experiences 
with Ronnie. Her almost omniscient narration provides 
more depth to the Krays and insight into their rather 
tumultuous world.  
However artful the film and great the performances 
by Hardy, the film falls short in terms of historical 
accuracy, as is common for biopics. It seems only 

fitting that a story about gangsters would further stretch 
the truth to make it more entertaining, and “Legend” 
does just this. According to the biography of the Kray 
twins, “The Profession of Violence,” on which the film 
is based, and those that knew the Krays, Reggie was 
not quite as sane as his brother was unstable. Reggie 
had his own psychological problems and emotionally 
abused Frances, allegedly dripping his own blood on 
Frances while she slept because he knew of her fear of 
blood and wanted to torture her. 
According to the biography and those that knew 
the Krays, Frances was the innocent and emotionally 
tortured woman who hated her husband’s criminal 
enterprises as portrayed on screen. Another area of 
contention with the truth of the film relates to the 
sexuality of the twins. Both twins were reportedly 
bisexual, with Ronnie leaning more towards men 
than Reggie. The film does play with the truth, 
but that does not mean that it is not enjoyable or 
riveting. 
“Legend” boasts wonderful on screen portrayals 
and an intriguing script. Despite its aberrations from 
the truth, the film is fully entertaining for its rather 
long over two hour runtime and does show how 
the infamous Kray twins became something of a 
legend.

to further develop this test and 
determine what levels in the 
bodily fluid left behind indicate 
the age or ethnicity of an 
individual.
“One day we can say the 
person was old, Caucasian or veg-
etarian, I hope,” Halámek, who 
was originally a biochemist, said. 
This type of testing will not 
only allow forensic scientists to 
quickly narrow down their sus-
pect pools while they wait for the 
labs to return with a positive DNA 
match, but it will also be helpful 
when the fingerprint sample is 
smudged and does not provide 
enough information for testing to 
make a confirmed match. 
At this time, forensic scientists 
see fingerprints as pictures and 
compare them with databases, ac-
cording to Halámek. He explained 
that with the tests he developed, 
a degree in forensic science is not 
necessary, as it works just like at 
home blood glucose and preg-
nancy tests. 
These are “prescreening tests to 
really narrow a pool of suspects,” 
Halámek 
said. “It 
does not 
confirm 
some-
body 100 
percent, 
but it 
gives 
direction 
and it’s 
quick, 
fast and it 
is cheap.”

He has also begun working 
with Averill Park High School in 
Rensselaer County, establishing 
a forensics lab within the school.  
Halámek hopes that these students 
will look to continue their work at 
UAlbany when they graduate. 
“If it is possible to identify 
excellent high school students 
interested in forensics, why 
should they go away [for col-
lege]? Why can’t they enroll into 
SUNY Albany and we can have 
them as undergrads and then as 
graduates if they like,” the chem-
ist said. “That’s the plan, that’s 
the dream.”
The initial funding for this 
project, which took half a year 

to develop, came from UAlbany 
when Halámek agreed to become 
an assistant professor at the 
university in the fall of 2013. The 
research group is in the process 
of writing grant proposals from 
outside sources like the Office of 
Naval Resources and the Partner-
ship for Clean Corporation to 
pursue other projects related to 
the chemical compounds in fin-
gerprints and bodily fluids. 
Halámek’s study has been 
published in Analytical Chemistry 
and his work has been featured 
in The New York Times and the 
Times Union, as well as on CBS6 
Albany.

Researchers at the University at Albany found a way to easily narrow 
down pools of suspects without using DNA. 

Although she is recovering, 
she takes it one day at a time. 
She compares her eating 
disorder to that of an addiction.
“It’s something I won’t get 
over,” she says. “I have to tell 
myself everyday not to skip a 
meal, not to just binge because 
I’m upset. You can easily 
relapse.”
Now, McNaught has taken 
the initiative to raise awareness 
for eating disorders. Through 
her experience, she learned that 

it is important to talk about, 
acknowledge and accept these 
kinds of struggles.
In efforts to encourage others 
to do the same, she created and 
filmed a video this October with 
the help of her sorority sisters. 
It shows that everyone has their 
own battles and conquering 
them is possible. In under three 
weeks, the video has reached 
over 2,000 views.
“At first, I was so nervous to 
put up the video,” she said. “I 
was ashamed, I felt weak, and 
embarrassed. Now I’m like, I 
am that person. I have this issue. 
This is who I am, and that’s 
okay.”

Yoga is a way to relax and release tension during finals 
week. It’s a good way to loosen up your muscles and stay 
focused while studying. Taking yoga breaks during study 
sessions is a great way to stay relaxed. There are yoga classes 
in the Physical Education building offered by campus on a 
daily basis. Most smartphones have yoga apps that can take you 
through the positions if yoga classes aren’t your thing.

It’s been proven that taking a break while studying is 
proven to increase tests scores, based on a study from Psych 
Central. They are found to improve attention span. Go home, 
get some food, or even take a short nap. Scientists have said 
that even short breaks from tasks can increase productivity on 
them.

3 

The University at Albany is also there for you during 
finals week. This year they have a #StressLess program to 
help students get through finals by providing stress relieving 
activities. These include free coffee, a chair massage, therapy 
dogs, and snacks.

4 

Sleep! Sleeping is so crucial to having an attentive mind. 
Most studies prove that sleeping rather than cramming 
all night improves test scores. A lot of people try to stay up 
all night studying the night before a test, but this can in fact 
decrease test scores. Also choose sleep over staying up all night 
to cram.

5 

Go out and grab a drink. Staying in the library all day can be 
stressful, so go out for a couple of drinks with your friends 
after. This can significantly relieve stress because having fun 
does that. Make sure you don’t go out the night before the test 
though.

Mull said. “In part so as not 
to interfere with any of the 
work being done by those 
looking into the cause, but 
more importantly to avoid 
negatively impacting the 
family further.” 
On Thanksgiving, Ian “Chi-
no” Peralta, another UAlbany 
student who knew Paredes, 
created a GoFundMe page for 
Paredes’ family to help with 
funeral arrangements. 
“He was very genuine, 
caring and fair to everybody. 
He was never one to judge 
anybody,” Peralta wrote in the 
GoFundMe description. “He 
welcomed anybody with open 
arms and an open heart.” 
The same day, a new 
hashtag was started:  #RIP-
Johnny. More than 100 people 

used the hashtag between 
Nov. 26 and Dec. 1. It was 
side by side with others, 
including #ForeverAGreat-
Dane, #MissYouLikeCrazy 
and #JohnnyLivesForever. 
Many of his friends chose 
to use #LongLiveJ5, sharing 
pictures of him and words of 
encouragement for those who 
knew him. 
On Nov. 30, the official 
UAlbany Twitter posted, 
“The #UAlbany community 
is saddened by the passing of 
Johnny Paredes,” with infor-
mation about a memorial and 
ceremony being held in his 
honor on Dec. 1. 
“To lose somebody you’ve 
known for a lot of your life 
really hurts and I am sure his 
unexpected death is hurting 
a lot of people right now,” 
Peralta wrote. “I am 100 per-
cent sure his soul is in a better 
place right now.”

The Saints (5-3) just had a four-
game win streak snapped with an 81-
80 loss to Cornell, but responded with 
an 89-54 trouncing of Metro Atlantic 
Athletic Conference rival Manhattan. 
Siena has won five of their last six 
since losing their first two games 
to national semifinalists Duke and 
Wisconsin in back-to-back games to 
open the season. 
On the women’s side, UAlbany 
(6-2) enters after blowing an 11-point 
halftime lead to Army West Point in a 
65-62 road loss. 
The Great Danes have two losses to 
NCAA Tournament quality opponents 
after suffering their first loss a week 
ago to fourth-ranked Tennessee. 
Shereesha Richards and Imani Tate 
continue to lead the team, while other 
threats look to emerge to help open up 

the floor for the duo. 
Three-point threat Erin Coughlin 
had nine points against Army and 
could be the key on the perimeter for 
the Great Danes.
After missing the season-opener 
against Pepperdine, Tiana-Jo Carter 
had 16 points and 10 rebounds against 
Rhode Island to help add to Albany’s 
offensive threat. Regardless, Head 
Coach Katie Abrahamson-Henderson 
has stressed since the beginning that 
the UAlbany offense needs to be 
productive outside of Richards and 
Tate in order to remain successful. 
The Great Danes will get a matchup 
with one of Siena’s conference 
members, Fairfield, prior to Saturday’s 
Albany Cup at 5 p.m.
Siena (2-5), a WBI finalist in last 
year’s postseason, seems to be finding 
its identity after winning its last two 
games. Led by the sophomore duo 
of Kollyns Scarborough and Margot 
Hetzke, the Saints would be looking 
for its top win of the season in 
Saturday’s matchup with UAlbany.

By CELIA BALF

The thick, humid air 
of August seems like 
forever ago as I now 
layer up for the cold and 
take the tunnels to class. 
In August, the 
University at Albany 
women’s soccer team 
was one of the few teams 
on campus a month 
before the rest of the 
student body, enduring 
the brutal yet necessary 
preseason. Earlier in the 
semester I wrote a piece 
about the “preseason 
experience”: the sweat, 
the commitment, the 
unavoidable tears and 
the excitement that 
overwhelms every 
athlete’s body as his or 
her season is about to 
begin. Now, I’m here—a 
slightly washed-up 
retiree trying to reflect on 
a season of my dreams. 
In August our group 
was jittery, but the 
anticipation of a season 
ahead was able to carry 
out great soccer. Practices 
flowed nicely and we all felt 
like this was our year— it 
was something about the 
way that we could connect 
the ball to one another, laugh 
during warm-ups and then 
transition to being fully tuned 
in for a session. There would 
be ups and downs ahead like 
any season, but there was 
this clearness in the thick 
summer air. We were sure of 
our goal: to be America East 
Champions. 
The next two months were 

a grind— we traveled to 
North Carolina for seven days 
beating Davidson and fell in 
overtime to Campbell. For 
our next games we traveled to 
Syracuse to play Colgate and 
Syracuse in one weekend. On 
paper, our first chunk of the 
season seemed difficult, but 
it just reassured us that come 
conference play we were going 
to dominate. It was the feeling 
of running beside a Syracuse 
player knowing that despite her 
noticeable difference in thigh 
muscle from mine, I could 

keep up with her. It was the 
feeling of making a tackle in 
the box and thinking I could 
just stay down right now and 
never get up, but I have to get 
up. It’s that feeling of Syracuse 
having to waste time in the last 
seven minutes because we were 
pressing them so hard. It was 
all of these feelings starting a 
fire that would burn through the 
fall season. 
Our out of conference play 
was all over the place—we 
won some big games, and lost 
to some mediocre teams. Our 

head coach had a baby, and 
our assistant coach took over 
as associative head coach. Our 
starting goalkeeper got injured 
and had to sit out the rest of 
her senior season. The ups and 
downs came in waves. 
The biggest wave, however, 
was the one that took us from 
a point where we may have not 
even made the post-conference 
tournament, to going all the 
way and winning the program’s 
first ever America East 
Championship. When I look 
at my teammates now I still 

get chills throughout 
my body from that 
championship game 
— we came back in 
a valiant effort to 
beat Hartford at their 
home turf 2-1. The 
moment the clock ran 
out our team embraced 
one another and 
screamed, cried and 
knew that everything 
up to that point was 
completely worth it. 
The dreaded beep test, 
the notoriously long 
SEBCO running test, 
the losses that made 
bus rides dreadful and 
awkward, the practices 
that ran rain or shine—
all worth it. We will 
never get this one-in-a-
million team back and 
I will hold onto that for 
the rest of my life. Few 
people can say they are 
champions, especially 
in college—but now, 
we can finally join 
the banner crew of so 
many other teams at 
UAlbany. 
The scariest part is 
now. Soccer is done, and the 
retired life is too real. I miss 
the soreness of a long practice, 
I miss the feeling of sitting on 
the bus indulging in pizza after 
a hard-fought game, I miss 
losing myself in my sport with 
all of my teammates. These 
feelings will continue to be 
missed when the spring season 
comes along and Bob Ford 
Field is used once again by the 
Great Danes, absent the eight 
seniors I played beside for 
four years.

Danes prepare for Capital city battle

BASKETBALL

By SHANE MARSHALL

 Get ready for a battle, Albany.   
 Saturday’s matchup at the Times 
Union Center is a showdown of two of the 
hottest men’s basketball programs in the 
Northeast. 
University at Albany enters the week 
with wins in six of its last seven, and an 
overtime win over Holy Cross, in which 

the Great Danes (6-3) shot a season-high 
27-for-30 (90 percent) from the free throw 
line, and tied a season-high with nine 
3-pointers. 
After averaging just 8.5 points over 
seven games, UAlbany guard Peter 
Hooley broke out for a season-high 20 
points in the 88-84 overtime triumph over 
Holy Cross on Saturday. Meanwhile, 
freshman Joe Cremo has provided depth to 

the Great Danes’ perimeter, averaging 12 
points off the bench for head coach Will 
Brown’s squad. 
Perhaps the biggest surprise from 
UAlbany has been the play from its big 
men. Mike Rowley, Greig Stire and Travis 
Charles all have contributed solid minutes 
to reinforce Brown saying this group is 
more talented than a year ago, despite 
losing America East first-teamer Sam 

Rowley to graduation. 
After improving to 2-3 on the road, 
UAlbany faces its toughest challenge since 
opening the season at Kentucky’s Rupp 
Arena, the Great Danes play Saturday 
against Siena. 
The Saints (5-3) just had a four-game 
win streak snapped with an 81-80 loss 

By AARON CHERIS

Joining the Albany 
Student Press was the best 
decision I’ve ever made in 
my entire life. 
The ASP has given 
me opportunities I never 
thought I’d have when I 
started as a freshman at the 
University at Albany in 
2012. 
The ASP has taken 
me many places, from 
Columbus to Cornell, 
Colgate to Buffalo, and to 
channel 23, The Weather 
Channel, on your campus 
television. 
I have been the sports 
editor since the fall 2013 
semester. My time as editor 
has been a whirlwind ride, 
but I wouldn’t have traded it 
for anything.
When I started as sports editor, I had 
no clue what I was getting myself into. 
The ASP was without a sports editor, and 
someone asked if I was interested in the 
position because of my love for sports. 
After an interview with then-editor-
in-chief Lauren Mineau, I was in. That 
year was a learning experience for me. 
I learned field hockey, soccer, softball, 
and many other sports I wasn’t too 
familiar with. 
Quickly, I was thrown into the fire. 
For the first time in decades, UAlbany 
made a football coaching change. 
The men’s and women’s basketball 
teams went on improbable winning 
streaks to take home the America East 
championships. 
I followed the pep band and 
interviewed the student inside Damien’s 
mascot costume who made headlines 
after fighting Stony Brook’s mascot on 
national television. 
Junior year was the most exciting. 

Coaches welcomed me into their offices 
to talk sports, and I was comfortable in 
my position. 
Last spring, I didn’t go more than 
two weeks without writing an article 
in the ASP. It started with an interview 
with UAlbany lacrosse player Lyle 
Thompson, arguably the greatest college 
lacrosse player ever. 
However, the highlight of my time 
at the ASP came in March. I’d seen 
UAlbany win plenty of conference 
championships, but that couldn’t have 
prepared me for Saturday, March 14. 
Championship Saturday: UAlbany 
versus Stony Brook. A sold out SEFCU 
Arena rocked like I’ve never heard 
before as the Great Danes and Seawolves 
battled for a spot in the NCAA 
Tournament. It appeared UAlbany’s luck 
was finally running out as they trailed by 
seven with under two minutes left. 
In a script too real for Hollywood, the 
Danes came back. In the game’s waning 
moments, the ball found Peter Hooley, 

the Great Dane who missed part of the 
season to go back to Australia when his 
mother died. 
His shot was a perfect swish, and 
UAlbany won. As the fans stormed 
the court, I fired off a tweet from the 
Albany Student Press account that would 
be retweeted and favorited dozens of 
times. The play was number one on 
SportsCenter’s Top 10 that night. After 
plenty of hugs and high fives on the 
court, it was time to get back to work. 
Leading into spring break, I knew I 
had to get to the NCAA Tournament 
game. Shane Marshall, my friend and 
fellow December 2015 graduate, offered 
me a spot in his car for the eight-hour 
drive to Columbus. I took it. 
In the days leading up to it, I was 
asked to appear on The Weather Channel 
for a segment about college basketball, 
the NCAA Tournament, and of course 
weather. During my interview with Sam 
Champion and Jim Cantore, I held up an 
ASP for the nation to see, and proceeded 

to talk about the Great 
Danes with The Weather 
Channel’s top talent. 
In Columbus, the 
Danes’ season ended, but 
it was a ride I’ll never 
forget and one I am proud 
to be a part of. 
Back on campus, 
Thompson finished off 
his Great Danes career 
with another title and 
scoring record. Lacrosse 
goalie Blaze Riorden 
made SportsCenter’s top 
10 with a goal of his own 
in the NCAA Tournament 
against Cornell, providing 
another highlight in a year 
stuffed with too many to 
count. 
This year, involvement 
in the ASP has 
skyrocketed. New writers 
and photographers eased 
my workload and made my job a lot 
easier. 
My search for a replacement led me 
to one of the athletes who I covered: 
women’s soccer player Celia Balf. She 
will be sports editor next semester, and 
I believe she will do great things for the 
ASP. 
Working for the ASP helped me get 
an internship with Anton Community 
Newspapers in my home on Long Island. 
It’s given me a chance to work for two 
professional sports teams, the New York 
Cosmos and Albany Devils. 
The ASP has given me the skills I 
need to move forward as I pursue a 
career in sports journalism. I have met 
some amazing people who have really 
helped me during my time at UAlbany. 
Lastly, the ASP has given me some 
of the best memories of my college 
experience. It has been a ride I’ll never 
forget. 
Thank you, Albany Student Press.
