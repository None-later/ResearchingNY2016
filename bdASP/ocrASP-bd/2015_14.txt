University at Albany police are 
continuing to investigate an altercation that 
occured on a CDTA bus early Saturday 
morning.    
According to a police report filed, three 
female students boarded the No. 11 bus 
early Saturday and went to sit in the back. 
Eye-witness reports said that a verbal 
argument broke out between the three 
women, who were black, and a number 
of other students (approximately 10-12, 
according to reports) on the bus, who were 
white. After the bus drove onto campus, 
the arguement became physical, said the 
eyewitnesses. During the fight, one of the 
women recalled a group of white males 
standing over her and kicking and punching 
her repeatedly while she was on the floor of 
the bus, according to the police report. The 
alleged victims claimed that nobody on the 
vehicle attempted to intervene to stop the 
fight, and that the attackers used racial slurs 
towards them.
Eventually, the bus stopped at the Social 
Sciences bus stop, and two of the women 
who were assaulted were taken to Albany 
Medical Center for evaluation. Both had 
“minor abrasions on their faces,” according 
to the police report. The third female in the 
party opted to not seek medical attention.
As earlier reported by the Albany Times 
Union, CDTA bus drivers are trained to call 
the dispatch center if an attack occurs on a 
bus. The dispatch center then would notify 
police.
Albany police and the university police 
are investigating the incident by going 
over the CDTA bus video footage. Law 
enforcement also has received additional 
video footage of the incident that other bus 
riders took on their cellphones. UAlbany 
President Robert J. Jones issued the 
following statement on Saturday.
“Dear Students, Faculty and Staff:
Early this morning, three of our students 
were harassed and assaulted while riding on 
a CDTA bus on Western Ave. in Albany.
The students, who are Black women, 
stated that racial slurs were used by the 
perpetrators, whom they described as a 

group of 10 to 12 white males and females.
I am deeply concerned, saddened and 
angry about this incident. There is no place 
in the UAlbany community for violence, no 
place for racial intolerance and no place for 
gender violence.
I am out of town today. I have decided 
to cut my trip short and will be returning 
to Albany as soon as I can to address this 
situation.
In the meantime, I have been in direct 
contact with the Provost and executive 
leadership team and have directed that the 
University respond rapidly and forcefully.

Our police, our student affairs personnel 
and our Office of Diversity and Inclusion 
staff are working together to support our 
young women.
We are working closely with the Albany 
Police Department to identify the persons 
responsible. If those individuals are 
UAlbany students, we will hold them fully 
accountable for their behavior.
I call upon all members of the University 
at Albany to unite. We must show the world 
that we stand for inclusiveness and stand 
against bias, violence and hatred.
Our annual Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. 

celebration will be held on the evening 
of Monday, Feb. 1. As we reflect on the 
principles and values that Dr. King stood 
for, let us come together in solidarity to 
reaffirm our values.
Now is the time to recommit to our 
principles of inclusivity and diversity and 
send a strong message that we will not 
tolerate bias, hatred and violence in our 
University.
Sincerely,
Robert J. Jones
President”

people boomed in the Campus 
Center by the small fountain

officials cut the ribbons off of the 
Blackstone LaunchPad. 

By CONNOR MURPHY

The sleek glass enclosure, decked out with customized 
tablet stands, a big-screen TV and other smart-room 
appliances has been labeled an “entrepreneurship hub” by 
both the university and the multimillion dollar investors 
from The Blackstone Charitable Foundation. 
The Foundation is a not-for-profit offshoot of the 
Blackstone Group, described by The New York Times as 
“the largest alternative investment firm in the world.” Its 
assets under management are worth over $300 billion.
“Blackstone LaunchPad is a critical part of a key strategy 
that you’ve only heard us talk about over the last year,” 
President Robert J. Jones said at the press conference. “It’s a 
key part of our strategy and our commitment to enhance the 
undergraduate experience.”
The LaunchPad opening marks a step towards a more 

profit-oriented environment for students of any discipline, 
coming off the heels of a $4.5 million shared investment 
into five New York schools including UAlbany. University 
and Blackstone officials said the program has the potential 
to create 4,000 new ventures and 6,000 new jobs across the 
state over the next five years.
“Blackstone is a leading global asset management firm,” 
said UAlbany ’83 graduate Michael Nash, now executive 
chairman of Blackstone Real Estate Debt Strategies. “We 
invest capital on behalf of literally millions of public 
pensioners worldwide. Because buying and improving 
companies is a core part of what we do, you can imagine 
that entrepreneurship is a critical and crucial element of our 
culture within our firm and our business.”
“When seeking out investment opportunities, we aim to 
bring our financial and intellectual capital to bear in a way 
that helps businesses succeed and grow,” Nash added at the 
press conference.
One university official emphasized the Blackstone Group 
as a separate entity from the Blackstone not-for-profit, as 
reported in a previous ASP article. The for-profit, which 
employs Nash, has been in the sights of federal regulatory 
agencies and the media for years. On Oct. 7, 2015, or 
roughly three weeks before the LaunchPad partnership was 
announced, Blackstone settled with the SEC for $39 million

The University at Albany 
has released the second 
version of its official mobile 
application after the app’s 
first release in 2014. The new 
version of the app contains 
numerous upgrades to the 
system, along with many of 
the original features.
The app’s redesign 
comes from a collaboration 
between UAlbany’s Office 
of Communication and 
Marketing and the Information 
Technology Services. The 
most prominent new feature is 
access to MyUAlbany within 
the app.
“It started with the 
MyUAlbany integration 
request and we had surveyed 
a bunch of students in the 
campus center,” Shivam 
Parikh, the original developer 
for the app, said.
The app’s integration with 
MyUAlbany allows students 
to check if they have any 
holds on their account, look 
at their grades, or check up on 
their class schedule.
“We’ve talked to students 
and they’ve taken pictures of 
their schedule for their first 
week,” Brian Smith, the web 
developer manager at the 
Office of Communications, 

said. “Well, hopefully this 
beats that.”
The developers of the app 
sat down with focus groups 
to find out what they liked or 
disliked about the redesign. 
They also took opinions 
directly from students to 
incorporate its new features.
“One of the most 
convenient things for us 
for testing was going to the 
Campus Center,” Smith 
said. “The Campus Center is 
awesome because students 
are just sitting there and they 
already have their phones 
open.”
The app includes previous 
favorites like Laundry View, 
SUNY Card updates, and 
events that are occurring 
around campus. They also 
improved the transit times 
as the previous app had 
inconsistent times for the bus.
The developers said that 
the support and leadership 
from their directors along with 
the freedom to work without 
interruption on the app 
allowed the two departments 
to work closely together on 
all facets of the design and 
development of the app.
Jeff Goodwin is one of 
the app developers from IT 
developement. 
“IT Services focused on the 

selection and implementation 
of the technologies to 
modernize the application 
and enable seamless 
integration with MyUAlbany,” 
Goodwin said, “which 
enabled Communication 
and Marketing to focus on 
enhancing the design and 
content for the application.”
The user interface has been 
completely redone. Instead 
of icons covering the entire 
home screen, a single picture 
of the University’s fountain is 
center, with drop-down menus 
to view.
“I think when kids come 
to campus the first thing they 
notice about it is the iconic 
fountain,” said Parikh. “It’s 
the fountain that is on the 
SUNYcard and it’s the place 
for everyone to be.”
The developers stress the 
use of the push notification 
function because it will only 
be activated for emergency 
purposes. Around two-thirds 
of students don’t have the 
emergency notifications 
enabled on the app, according 
to Smith.
“We don’t use it for things 
like to promote any events, 
just because it will drag people 
off. It’s for emergencies only,” 
Parikh said.

The Collaborative 
Transformation Project, a 
group that strives to lessen the 
oppression that can happen 
in professional spaces and 
especially universities, hosted a 
conference to start the year off 
on campus last week. 
The keynote speakers at the 
event, which was on Jan. 28 
in the Standish Room, were 
Dr. Betty Wambui, chair of 
the Department of Africana 
and Latino Studies at SUNY 
Oneonta, and Dr. Kathleen 
O’Mara, a graduate from 
Columbia University and a 
researcher of African and Near 
Eastern history. Unfortunately, 
Dr. O’Mara was unable to 
attend the conference due to an 

unseen hospitalization, so only 
Dr. Wambui spoke that night 
to what started as a group of 30 
or so of her fellow colleagues 
and peers, but branched into a 
gathering of almost double that 
number, faculty and students 
alike. 
Dr. Wambui, after an 
introduction by Oscar 
Williams, a professor here at 
the University at Albany in 
the Africana department, went 
on to explain her thoughts 
and ideas on marginalized 
groups, how they are perceived 
and treated in university 
spaces, and what can be 
done to advance equality. 
Using indigenous people as 
an example for most of her 
presentation, she went on to 
portray a scene of how these 

marginalized people are treated 
in universities.
Wambui said that many 
marginalized groups at 
universities often cannot speak 
their mind or talk about their 
negative experiences. This is 
out of fear of a professional 
attack, which could possibly 
lead to them being shunned, 
or even get them fired, 
according to Wambui. Many 
marginalized groups do not 
have a platform to speak from 
in the first place, such as a 
publication.
She also spoke about 
inequality on a more global 
scale. Wambui said in 
reference to the sorghum plant, 
“You cannot just look at it, and 
see a plant. You need to see all 
the woman that worked to keep 

it alive, and how it wouldn’t 
exist without their culture.”
She said that many cultures 
and marginalized groups have 
valuable experiences, but are 
ignored because they are not 
considered important by their 
colonizers. This sorghum 
example is only one.
Many cultures have their 
own traditions, be it the 
food they cook or traditional 
medicines that are forgotten 
because they do not have 
enough time to pass it 
down to future generations. 
Marginalized groups also do 
not have enough time and this 
harms them more, according to 
Wambui. By trying to fit into 
the Center (center being her 
word for the “non-marginalized 
groups”), those who are 

privileged (and in other ways 
trying to survive) do not have 
any time left for preservation 
of their cultures.  
One of Wambui’s final 
statements was that UAlbany 
should try to realize what an 
effect it can have on these 
marginalized groups and 
should speak up more. She is 
convinced that with enough 
time and effort, radical change 
can happen. 
Wambui closed her talk 
by emphasizing how the 
marginalized groups should 
not lose themselves and should 
avoid trying to become the 
Center, and instead stand in 
the Center while retaining their 
own experiences and cultures.

Students and faculty gathered to see the unveiling of the Blackstone LaunchPad, 
UAlbany’s latest initiative to spur student innovation.

after “they 
failed to 
fully inform 
investors 
about 
benefits that the advisers obtained from 
accelerated monitoring fees and discounts 
on legal fees.” 
From that amount a reported $10 
million was paid in a fine and $29 million 
awarded to affected fund investors, which 
ended the SEC’s probing.
“This SEC matter arose from the 
absence of express disclosure in 
marketing documents, 10 or more years 
ago, about the possible acceleration of 
monitoring fees,” Blackstone said. The 
practice has been reported as common in 
the industry, although the SEC has been 
critical.
“Full transparency of fees and conflicts 
of interest is critical in the private 
equity industry and we will continue 
taking action against advisers that do 
not adequately disclose their fees and 
expenses, as Blackstone did here,” 
Andrew J. Ceresney, director of the SEC’s 
Division of Enforcement, said in their 
2015 press release.
The Blackstone Charitable Foundation 
reported in 2013 tax filings that its parent 
company and four of its subsidiaries 
shared $400,000 with the not-for-
profit, or roughly over 20 percent of the 
Foundation’s value at the time.
University spokesperson Karl Luntta 
said there was a written agreement 
between UAlbany and the Foundation, but 
refused to state whether the contract was 
private or public information.
Multiple Blackstone spokespeople have 
refused multiple requests for comment.
After the LaunchPad press conference, 
a reception with refreshments was held 
with university and Blackstone officials 
on hand to give a tour of the business 
center. It also served to get students 
acquainted with LaunchPad employees, 

some of which were students 
themselves. One of these employees, 
UAlbany Graduate of ’87 Jan T. 
Woodcock, will be executive director 
of the program.
“My role is to facilitate the goal of 
the Blackstone LaunchPad, which is 
really to help all students understand 
what it takes to start a business,” 
Woodcock said. He explained that 
if students worked through his staff 
with a viable business idea, they could 
eventually obtain funding for their 
venture through the LaunchPad’s 
network.
Woodcock previously worked for 
one of the “Big Four” independent 
auditors Deloitte, a distinction shared 
by Nash, and has been an advisory 
board member for the university since 
2004.
“I am on the board of the business 
school,” Woodcock added. “I’ve had 
student intern teams work for me in the 
past, and I’ve been a judge on a lot of 
the business case competitions, so I’ve 
been involved in the university.”
One feature of the LaunchPad 
this year is a Student Business Plan 
Competition, which again stresses 
that students from all disciplines and 
departments can enter. Thirty-three 
prizes totaling $50,000 will be given 
out after tax day in 2016, although a 
one-page Executive Summary must 
meet the Feb. 12 nomination deadline 
and be selected by the competition 
judges.
Questions regarding the competition 
can be forwarded to Sanjay Goel, 
the principal investigator for the 
Blackstone LaunchPad Project, or at 
the email launchpad@albany.edu.

LaunchPad announcement report,

ndia is beginning to take progressive 
steps towards equality with its 
elected officials pushing for LGBTQ 
rights in the country.
Journalist Raghu Karnad of The 
New York Times recently reported that 
Parliament member Shashi Tharoor 
proposed a bill to “decriminalize gay 
sex.” And while the final tally was 24-71 
against Tharoor’s bill, the country is still 
making great strides for inclusion.
“Mr. Tharoor intends to change 
Section 377 of India’s penal code, a 
Victorian-era provision that punishes 
‘whoever voluntarily has carnal 
intercourse against the order of nature 
with any man, woman or animal’ with 
life imprisonment,” Karnad said.
Karnad reported that actual 
convictions are few, but the law is used to 
blackmail and harass gay and transgender 
people in India.
It is almost easy to assume, from the 

perspective of an American, that all other 
countries have made a steady progression 
toward equality for all sexualities and 
genders. America is proving that to be 
very true just by the recent Supreme 
Court decision to legalize gay marriage 
nationwide. In a country where equality 
is growing, albeit at a gradual pace, it is 
a hard pill to swallow to know that there 
are other democratic countries like India 
that have yet to grant equality to all.
“Section 377 remains for now, 
and as Mr. Tharoor learned, India’s 
dysfunctional Parliament is still some 
way from changing it,” Karnad said. 
“But the gradual accretion of support 
for reform from politicians of various 
persuasions is creating what a wise 
judicial decision might well have pre-
empted.”
Like the point that Karnad makes, 
a decision to radically change societal 
standards hasn’t been made, but the 
conversation surrounding the bill and gay 
rights is growing. It is sparking a national 
debate, or perhaps a re-questioning of the 

culture that has existed for centuries.
Clearly, one stark decision that would 
have drastically changed these laws 
would not have changed how the public 
perceives the law.
In the article, Karnad said, “it would 
have done relatively little to change the 
social stigma and institutional hostility 
faced by sexual minorities.”
This will have to be a lifelong struggle. 
The “sexual minorities” will, for a long 
time, have to adjust to the ever-changing 
society.
Rationally, the integration of “sexual 
minorities” does not have to be such a 
daunting task. I am a firm believer in 
accepting a person despite whom they 
choose to love, and in a perfect world, 
gay people, straight people and everyone 
else who falls on the spectrum can live 
harmoniously together. I don’t see why it 
cannot function this way in India as well.
And, while it is unfortunate that 
Tharoor’s bill did not pass this time, I am 
enlightened to hear that he will attempt to 
pass this bill again in the spring.

Karnad said, “[Tharoor] hopes that a 
full discussion in Parliament will be an 
opportunity to broadcast that L.G.B.T. 
rights are ‘not about sex but about 
freedom.’”
I fully support Tharoor and I see it as 
my responsibility to spread this message 
of equality that he is calling for in India 
on any platform available, as this existing 
law needs to be refuted.
And yes, the bill that he will propose 
will most likely have the same outcome 
as the last time he brought it up, but at 
least he is resilient enough to continue to 
fight for this. This fight is undoubtedly 
going to continue and it’ll be a long fight 
that will, in due time, gain momentum 
and a following that will drive the Indian 
Parliament to make the right decision the 
next time around.
The entirety of the social realm in 
India would change just to include these 
groups of people, but in order to change 
this society, this bill will have to be that 
first step.

Small steps to giant leaps: 
India’s push for LGBTQ rights

WORLD NEWS

Benson Kua / Wikipedia.org
Pictured above is the flag that represents the LGBTQ community. India has been trying to push a bill that would decriminalize gay sex in the country. The bill has not been 
passed since the last time it was proposed, but it will be proposed again sometime in the spring.

n order to speak “like a man,” one must bring up hid 
lust for women, and do so casually. There must be 
a constant reminder to others that they are men and 
they have to exert “machismo” behavior and withhold 
emotions.
   Being a man, apparently, is proving to others that one 
is not gay or a woman. Being called either would be an 
insult to a real man. Being a man equates to nothing more 
than the hormone in a man’s body: testosterone. 
   What’s so bad with being gay and a woman? 
   There have been many things that gay people and 
women have done that surpass being a man. Being a man 
dictates that to have a lack of masculinity is a problem.
   If someone identifies as a man, then that’s it. 
Nothing can define them as less than a man, or better 
for that matter. Social and gender norms cast overt 
heterosexuality and surplus masculinity as integral parts 
of being a male. Society should no longer abide by that 

social construct. 
   A social norm for men is to be dominant over women. 
That concept is out of the scope of today’s times. We are 
trying to establish that no gender is more dominant than 
the other. 
   Although men try to suppress their sensitivity, they 
often fail to do so.
   Just as a reminder, not all men do this, but most do. 
Does it really matter if a guy likes the color pink? And 
who are these people to define what makes someone gay 
and a woman? 
   Women aren’t always frail and dainty, and 
homosexuals aren’t always colorful and feminine. 
Why is it impossible for men to say “fabulous?” Is the 
existence of “meninism” truly necessary? 
   “Meninism” is men’s rights centered movement that 
has surfaced as a sort of counter to feminism.  But, 
contrary to belief, “meninism” isn’t even a male version 
of feminism. The people involved with this movement 
are the ones who condone male dominance, which is 
the complete opposite of feminism. Feminism is the 

enforcement of equality of the sexes. “Meninism” is 
based on people changing the too feminine prefix to fit 
masculine standards. 
   Did a “manly man” give women the right to vote? 
   No.
While a man with less power is not considered a man, 
a man with equal power isn’t considered to be a man 
either. Fortunately, that’s beyond wrong.
      If masculinity wasn’t so fragile, people wouldn’t 
need to defend it. Every time an assertion is made that 
masculinity isn’t fragile, it serves to enforce its inherent 
fragility. 
   And for those who will try to explain why men have to 
be masculine, don’t bother. Masculinity is a descriptor, 
not a necessity. It can vary in levels, and yes, no matter 
how masculine someone is, they are still a man. 
   Men who constantly feel the need to defend their 
masculinity should overcome their egos and realize that 
they are not hot shit. They are like everyone else and 
they are letting a simple word rule their lives.

According to UAlbany’s 
news center, historian and 
professor of the new course 
“History and Future” David 
Hochfelder said, “Our students 
will inhabit the future, a world 
that will present very different 
challenges and opportunities 
from today’s world.”  
Hochfelder makes a very 
good point. The world is 
changing and as it does 
universities nationally and 
internationally (UAlbany 
included) need to make the 
proper adjustments to their 
courses and the information 
that they feed to 

students in the current society 
to prepare for the world that 
they will encounter. It is 
no longer enough to teach 
students what is only relevant 
for today’s standards. If 
students are the future, then 
they need to learn about 
the future just as much as 
anything from the past.          
A 21-year-old senior and 
human biology major at 
UAlbany, who requested to 
remain anonymous, said, “I 
do agree that opening these 
courses is the right thing to 
do.” She explained that it 
shows “the school is thinking 

progressively.”   
This semester will also 
feature a new course revolving 
around the hot topic of 
climate change. The course, 
based on its description, 
will primarily focus on the 
scientific reasoning of the 
changing climate and the 
social understandings and 
conversations surrounding it 
both locally and globally. 
“It culminates with the 
Power Dialog, an organized 
public meeting including top 
state government officials 
discussing how to meet the 
goals of the Paris agreement, 
the national Clean Power Plan 
and New York’s commitment 
to clean energy,” according 
to the UAlbany news center 
report.
Another course that the 
university is implementing 
this semester is one based 
on cybersecurity titled, “The 
Threat Within.” The course 
will explore real life cases of 

the cybersecurity challenge. 
“As the Edward Snowden 
case, one of the largest and 
most damaging data breaches 
in U.S. government history 
has taught us, insider threats 
can surface at the strategic, 
operational and tactical 
layers of an organization, 
and require a solution that is 
comprehensive, logical, and 
balanced,” the UAlbany news 
center wrote.
The university is making 
some important decisions 
about the necessity of 
knowledge for its students. 
And never could I imagine 
that these topics would be 
relevant to UAlbany students 
in 1950. It is important that 
we touch on these issues now, 
because they are based on 
cases that students today are 
witnessing first-hand.
Students at the university 
are being properly prepared 
for the changing landscape 
for the world that they will 

inevitably face. UAlbany is 
looking past the standard of 
courses that was set centuries 
ago and is evolving with the 
changing culture that we are 
now living in. Of course, it 
could have been very easy 
to keep the same practices 
that have been in place thus 
far, but then there would no 
growth for the university or 
for its students.
If college is supposed to 
prepare students to face the 
real world, then right now 
UAlbany is doing a good 
enough job and making sure 
that its students know what 
to face when they leave the 
confines of this campus.
And all the while, these 
courses seem engaging and 
refreshing. I’m sure that they 
will have a long life at the 
university and get some great 
reviews from the students who 
have chosen to pursue them.

T

he University at Albany is now 
incorporating current and relevant social 
issues into its new Spring 2016 course 
listing. This semester is featuring courses dealing 
with cybersecurity and sustainability, among 
others.

WORTHY ADDITIONS TO UALBANY

By KAYLA POPUCHET
D

espite many noteworthy 
films with minority actors 
and actresses, the Oscars this 
year had an extreme lack of 
representation of people of color. 
All Stacey Dash, actress and Fox News 
correspondent of mixed race, had to 
say about the situation was that “Black 
History Month and BET shouldn’t exist, 
since they further divide us.  I feel like 
it’s hypocritical to say that we’re all the 
same, but then to self-segregate into little 
enclaves of society.  Also, I think the 
#OscarsSoWhite controversy is lame, 
because black people should not demand 
that every segment of society who 
watches movies be reflected in the number 
of Oscars given to actors and actresses.”
Dash has once again proven herself to 
be the poster child for internalized racism.
While it is true that division and 
exclusion between races in terms of 
media outlets does not work towards 
equality, the fundamental point of Black 
History Month and Black Entertainment 
Television seems to have flown right over 
Dash’s head. People of color, specifically 
black people, are underrepresented in 
history, media and politics. 
Black History Month is a necessity in 
our culture, for it seems as though that’s 

the only time people hear about black 
history other than the period between 
the Triangle-Slave-Trade and the Voting 
Right’s Act of 1965. 
History, especially in public high 

schools, is whitewashed. Only the 
struggles, as well as the history of 
Europeans who enslaved and exploited the 
vast majority of the world, are taught. Our 
country was built by Europeans’ genocide 

of the natives and the exploitation of 
Africans - that is what our culture has 
been founded on. 
But Dash is correct. Black people 
should not expect to see the amount of 
awards and recognition proportional to the 
amount of effort and achievement their 
works deserve. “That’s just not how the 
world works,” according to Dash.
Racism, by definition, is experienced 
by the marginalized group at the hands 
of the race with institutional and 
systematic power. But people of color 
can internalize that racism and project it 
onto themselves and their worldly views. 
Internalized racism attacks any other 
marginalized group being oppressed and 
underrepresented in this unspoken social 
caste system created to keep those at the 
bottom forever at the bottom.  
Internalized racism is a tactic used by 
oppressors to keep the marginalized from 
joining together and overthrowing the 
unjust and unbearable system never made 
for minorities. 
It is not BET or Black History Month 
that is keeping us divided as a society, but 
rather the deep-rooted racial injustices 
in all of the aspects of American culture, 
from our political structure to the way 
banks are run, the way home loans are 
given, and even our Oscars.

Stacey Dash is still clueless

order to for different races to socially integrate we must eliminate these things.

Actor Nate Parker plays the role of historical rebellion leader Nat Turner in the 2016 Sundance film “The Birth of a Nation.” 

FILM 
SUNDANCE FESTIVAL 2016 
Big sales amid streaming service takeover 

By THOMAS KIKA

The Oscars?  Those are old news, friend.  
With the Sundance Film Festival in Park 
City, Utah, concluded, the biggest and most 
interesting films that the indie scene has 
to offer for the next year and beyond have 
had their time in the spotlight, vying for 
the attention of film-lovers and distributors 
alike. It is far from hyperbole to call this 
a huge year for the festival, with record-
shattering sales and big moves by exciting 
new kids on the block, all of which teases 
an exciting near future at the movies.
The biggest success story of this 
year’s festival – and, indeed, of the entire 
history of Sundance – was “The Birth of 
a Nation,” starring, written, and directed 
by rapidly rising star, Nate Parker (“The 
Great Debaters,” “Beyond the Lights”). 
Based on the well-known slave uprising, 
the provocatively-titled film tells the story 
of Nat Turner (Parker), the man who led his 
fellow slaves in rebellion against plantation 
owners in 19th Century Virginia. After the 
premiere, critics enthusiastically praised the 
film for its impactful brutality and its strong 

sense of urgency, though some offered 
a more measured critique of the film as 
heavy-handed.  
Perhaps further propelled by the recent 
#OscarsSoWhite controversy, studios were 
quick to start the bidding war for the rights 
to distribute the acclaimed film. Nearly 
every studio in Hollywood was in the mix, 
including Sony, Universal, Warner Bros., 
Paramount, and Lionsgate, according to 
Deadline. Eventually, Fox Searchlight won 
the rights with a staggering $17.5 million 
bid, the largest in Sundance history, after 
Searchlight’s own $12 million bid for “Me 
and Earl and the Dying Girl” in 2015.  
Streaming giant Netflix bid as high 
as $20 million, but it was decided that 
Searchlight, the distributor of films like 
“12 Years a Slave” and “Birdman,” was 
more suited to push the film for awards, in 
contrast to the less experienced streaming 
service, whose first original film, “Beasts of 
No Nation,” was completely shut out at the 
Oscars this year.  No firm release date has 
been set, but Searchlight is expected to give 
“The Birth of a Nation” an awards-friendly 
fall 2016 release.  

It was not just the size of the deals that 
shook things up at this year’s festival, it 
was also who was making them. Ramping 
up their original content pushes, Amazon 
Studios and Netflix made big waves with a 
wide variety of distribution deals, including 
some very high-profile films.  
Amazon scored the biggest get, nabbing 
early critical darling “Manchester by 
the Sea” to the tune of $10 million. The 
film, a rare new release from celebrated 
director Kenneth Lonergan (“Margaret”), 
sees a man (Casey Affleck) forced to 
move back to his hometown and take legal 
guardianship of his nephew after the death 
of his brother. 
Along with praise for Lonergan’s 
expectedly exceptional sense of human 
drama, “Manchester by the Sea” has also 
drawn praise for what sounds like a career 
best performance from Casey Affleck. 
Amazon is expected to reteam with its 
“Chi-Raq” distribution partner, Roadside 
Attractions, to give the film a strong awards 
push this fall.  
Beyond that, Amazon also bought the 
rights to films like the well-received Jane 

Austen adaptation, “Love & Friendship,” 
and the rights to “Weiner-Dog,” the latest 
from provocative auteur Todd Solondz. 
While certainly making their presence 
known, Netflix came away with some 
less than exciting acquisitions, including 
the Ellen Page drama, “Tallulah,” and the 
Paul Rudd-Selena Gomez vehicle, “The 
Fundamentals of Caring.” While certainly 
liked by some, those films overall had much 
more muted receptions.  
Beyond all of the big, headline-grabbing 
events were the many other interesting 
films seeking exposure at the festival. 
“Swiss Army Man” put a dark spin on 
the “Cast Away” story, with Paul Dano 
as a stranded man who befriends a corpse 
played by Daniel Radcliffe.  “Southside 
with You” took a “Before Sunrise”-inspired 
look at Barack and Michelle Obama’s 
first date back in 1989. “Sleight” offered 
a sci-fi-tinged tale about a young street 
magician trying to use his talents to provide 
for his family. The list goes on, and anyone 
with an interest in independent cinema, 
or cinema in general, is certain to find 
something that peaks their interest in the 
Sundance 2016 catalogue.

It was about 35 degrees on the 
night of Jan. 28, but a cascade 
of warm air and geniality surged 
through the tiny dive bar The Low 
Beat as friends, bandmates, and 
strangers alike crammed together. 
The occasion? A mixed bill of four 
local musical acts performing for free. 
And although it was announced less 
than a week prior, the show managed 
to draw roughly 70 people, which 
easily feels like 100 in the small 
confines of the venue. Whether the 
strong attendance was attributed to 
the nonexistent entrance fee or the 
tremendous variety of styles between 
the performers, it was a great night for 
underground music in Albany. 
Pinesheets kicked off the show 
with an avant-garde selection of 
experimental synth pop. Armed 

with just a series of samples and 
a microphone strapped with an 
echo-like, distorted effect, the one-
man act had the room questioning 
whether they should bop their heads 
or focus all of their brainpower into 
dissecting the many sonic layers. The 
mediocre sound system most likely 
contributed, but nearly every lyric 
was indistinguishable. However, that 
didn’t seem to matter because the 
focus was more on the atmosphere it 
evoked rather than specific thoughts. 
Concert attendee Jaran Chance 
said, “This is next level indie,” 
meaning that it definitely didn’t 
appeal to everyone. 
Although Pinesheets’ “zone-out” 
tunes didn’t transfer particularly well 
in the live setting, it is thoughtful 
music worthy of a second chance via 
headphones. 
Hill Haints followed with a stark 

juxtaposition of loud, garage-esque, 
rock and roll that never once slowed 
down. Featuring an odd range of 
ages within the band—the white-
haired vocalist/guitarist and balding 
drummer looked to be twice as old as 
the bassist—the four-piece cranked 
out powerful, albeit repetitive, rock 
riffs coupled with screeching solos 
reminiscent of California stoner 
rockers Fu Manchu. The sudden 
increase in energy inspired numerous 
attendees to start jumping around up 
front and the temperature of the room 
seemed to increase by five degrees. 
Although not as fast-paced, the 
even noisier Scum Couch took the 
stage next and were thoroughly 
intriguing. Their heavily distorted 
blend of droning, rhythmic alt-rock 
with deranged experimental sections

without feeling pasted 
together. Vocalist and 
drummer Mark O’Brien 
was captivating to watch 
as he simultaneously 
wailed on his kit and into 
his mic, the latter of which 
used an effect to make it 
sound like a megaphone, 
before finishing the set by 
walloping up and down 
a keyboard positioned 
directly behind his drums.
Despite performing for 
only 15 minutes, Scum 
Couch were magnificent 
and would have been the 
highlight of the night. But 
then Throat Culture went 
on. Currently revered as 
one of Albany’s best up-
and-coming local bands, 
Throat Culture played 
a unique style of loud, 
groovy hardcore music 
that’s easiest to compare 
to another fantastic 
Albany hardcore band, 
Drug Church. However, 
Throat Culture has its own 
individual sound that differs 
from the more traditional, 
mosh-part-heavy 
hardcore of their Albany 
contemporaries Born Low 
and Trife Life. 
In fact, Throat Culture 
does not have a single 
mosh-part in any of their 
songs, instead focusing on 
bouncy rhythms and savory 
grooves. Nevertheless, 
their lack of china cymbal 
smacks didn’t stop the 
place from opening up 
into a chaotic pit that 
embodied the ’80s style 
of “slam-dancing” rather 
than modern “hardcore 
dancing.” Bodies were 
being thrown about and 
the tame, drinks-in-hand 
ambience of the previous 
set was instantly wiped 
from existence. However, 
no blood was shed during 
the ruckus and the only 
apparent victim was one 
of the other bands’ bass 
drum that multiple people 
got chucked into. Vocalist 
Seth Eggleston continued 
with the evening’s theme 
of vocal distortion, as his 
frantic yells were channeled 
through some sort of 
reverby effect pedal. 
Throat Culture was the 
perfect cap to an excellent 
night for the Albany scene.

    The 88th Academy Awards will be hosted 
by Chris Rock on Sunday, Feb. 28, meaning 
there is a month to speculate as to who will 
win. There are some phenomenal actors in the 
line-up this year, so the competition is running 
high.
   For Best Picture, nominations include “The 
Big Short,” “Mad Max: Fury Road,” “The 
Martian,” “Spotlight,” “Bridge of Spies,” 
“The Revenant,” and “Room.” 
    “The Revenant” is about explorer Hugh 
Glass (Leonardo DiCaprio) surviving in the 
wilderness to find his way home, injured and 
alone, in the early 1800s. “Bridge of Spies” is 
about an exchange of prisoners between the 
USSR and the United States during the Cold 
War, orchestrated by lawyer James Donovan 
(Tom Hanks) in order to secure the release 
of U.S. pilot Francis Gary, played by Austin 
Stowell. “Room” is about a young woman 
(Brie Larson) and her son (Jacob Tremblay) 
escaping from captivity and discovering the 
outside world. These three movies received 
rave reviews, and are only three out of eight 
contenders for the award. 
    For Best Actor in a Leading Role, nominees 
include Bryan Cranston (“Trumbo”), Eddie 
Redmayne (“The Danish Girl”), Michael 
Fassbender (“Steve Jobs”), Matt Damon (“The 
Martian”) and, of course, Leonardo DiCaprio 

(“The Revenant”). Eddie Redmayne, a British 
actor from Westminster, won this category 
last year for his role as Stephen Hawking in 
“The Theory of Everything.” He is also well-
known for his stunning performance in “Les 
Miserables,” and he has been chosen to play 
Newt Scamander in the upcoming “Fantastic 
Beasts and Where to Find Them.”
     Michael Fassbender, a German and 
Irish born actor, is most well-known for his 
role as a young Magneto in “X-Men”. He 
is also known for his roles in “Macbeth,” 
“Prometheus,” “12 Years a Slave,” 
“Inglorious Bastards,” among others. With the 
wide variety of his roles and many excellent 
performances, he definitely deserves to be up 
there with Redmayne and DiCaprio. 
     Speaking of DiCaprio, this is his fifth 
nomination for this category, and “The 
Revenant” was nominated in 12 categories. 
The American actor is well-known for 
his roles in “Titanic,” “The Wolf of Wall 
Street,” “Inception,” and “The Great 
Gatsby.” DiCaprio, despite his previous four 
nominations, has yet to win an Oscar, so many 
fans are rooting for him this year. With so 
many great films and so many nominations 
this year, none of the five nominees in this 
category are guaranteed the award.
    For Actress in a Leading Role, we have 
Jennifer Lawrence (“Joy”), Kate Blanchett 
(“Carol”), Charlotte Rampling (“45 Years”), 
Brie Larson (“Room”), and Saoirse Ronan 

(“Brooklyn”). 
    An American actress, Lawrence is well-
known for her roles in “The Hunger Games,” 
“Silver Linings Playbook,” “American 
Hustle,” and the “X-Men” franchise. 
Rampling, an English actress, played Kate 
Mercer in “45 Years,” Frances in “London 
Spy” and Lady Spencer in “The Duchess.” 
Ronan is an Irish-American actress, 
nominated for her role as Eilis Lacey in 
“Brooklyn.” The 21-year-old actress already 
has quite an impressive resume, starring in 
leading roles for films including “Hanna,” 
“Atonement,” and “The Grand Budapest 
Hotel.” 
    There has been a lot of controversy 
concerning the diversity of the Oscars, 
especially for this year’s selection. The 
membership at the Academy, starting after the 
2016 Awards, will be based on active work 
and award winnings. Membership will be 
renewed every 10 years, so long as the actor 
in question has remained active. Lifetime 
memberships will be given to those who 
maintain three 10 year memberships, or if they 
have been nominated or won an Award. 
    For those who do not maintain the 10 year 
activity requirement, they will still maintain 
“emeritus status,” but will be unable to 
vote. Also, three new governing seats will 
be created, and those seats will be filled by 
nominations from current President Cheryl 
Boone Isaacs, for three-year terms.

Rihanna strikes again 
with new album ‘Anti’

ALBUM REVIEW

By RUSSELL J. OLIVER

After years of teasing fans and 
withholding all information on her 
next studio album, Rihanna’s “ANTI” 
was finally released last Wednesday 
exclusively on Tidal, the music 
streaming service she has co-ownership 
in.
With a struggling marketing 
campaign backing the album, it 
originally leaked through Tidal last 
Wednesday evening. It was quickly 
removed after 20 minutes, but fans still 
had a chance to download it and tracks 
were then leaked online. The album 
was officially released later that night. 
Tidal also offered a limited number 
of fans a free download of the album, 
regardless of whether they were a Tidal 
subscriber.
After taking a hiatus from music for 
the past three years, Rihanna released 
three singles last year from the album. 
In the end, none of them made it to the 
final track list. Numerous speculative 
release dates had been made leading up 
to the release of the album.
Rihanna also promoted the album 
through Samsung, releasing cryptic 
videos entitled “ANTIdiary” leading 
up to it’s release. Samsung will also 
promote her upcoming Anti World 

Tour, which kicks off at the end of this 
month.
Sound-wise, “ANTI” is very 
different compared to her previous 
works. Rihanna is known for her 
bangers and chart-toppers, but “ANTI” 
is relatively clear of those kinds of 
songs. The most club-worthy song is 
“Work,” featuring frequent collaborator 
Drake. The song was released last 
Wednesday as the first official single 
from the album.
The rest of the album is very anti-
Rihanna, in a good way. She moves 
away from her dance-vibe to become 
a more chill and relaxed singer. The 
album isn’t a party-album, but instead 
has more of a relaxed tone, with a hint 
of a stoner vibe.
Rihanna begins the album 
confidently with “Consideration,” 
where she says “I got to do things my 
own way darling,” delivered in her 
Barbadian accent. In a way this line 
shows her approach to the entire album: 
it’s music she created for herself instead 
of her fans.
The album moves onto “James 
Joint,” the bad girls ode to her love 
of marijuana. Next on the track list is 
“Kiss It Better,” a groovy power ballad 
infused with ‘80s vibes. The single 
“Work” is next, which has a reggae-pop 

vibe to it.
The album then transitions into a 
slower-style, filled with many ballads 
beautifully sung by the songstress. 
This is perhaps Rihanna’s best vocal 
work on an album so far. She pushes 
the limit to her voice on many songs, 
in particular “Higher,” where Rihanna 
croons for a lover late at night. Her 
voice breaks as she belts out the chorus, 
which brings a certain realism to the 
pop star.
On “Same Ol’ Mistakes,” she teams 
up with Kevin Parker of Tame Impala 
to cover the bands psychedelic rock 
song of the same name. The song 
contains the same production as the 
original song and the same lyrics, 
except all sang by Rihanna in a woozy, 
aloof way.
“Love on the Brain” is another pop 
balled inspired by ‘50s music. Her 
vocals again shine on this track, which 
has a very Amy-Winehouse-vibe to 
it. She closes her album with another 
vocal standout, where she sings “Close 
To You,” a jazzy slow piano ballad.
Overall, the album has many strong 
songs that push Rihanna’s vocals to her 
brink. The album is not your typical 
Rihanna album, but pushes Rihanna 
away from being the hit-maker to more 
of a serious artist.

Two seniors of the University at 
Albany men’s lacrosse team, co-captains 
John Maloney and Blaze Riorden, were 
selected in the Major League Lacrosse 
(MLL) Collegiate Draft that took place 
in Baltimore on Jan. 22.
Maloney was selected with the 22nd 
pick by the Chesapeake Bayhawks. 
He will join UAlbany alum Matthew 
Bertrams, who played for the Great 
Danes from 2012-15. Riorden, the 
goalkeeper most famous for his coast-
to-coast goal scored against Cornell last 
season, was chosen by his hometown 
Rochester Rattlers with the 51st pick 
overall. Ty Thompson, cousin of former 
lacrosse stars Lyle and Miles Thompson, 
also plays for the Rattlers.
Both Maloney and Riorden have 
played lacrosse for more than a dozen 
years. Maloney started to play organized 
lacrosse when he was 6 years old, while 
Riorden began at the age of 4.
“I always dreamed of being able to 
play professionally,” Maloney said. “It 
was definitely a goal of mine, but you 
never know if you’ll get the chance.”
Riorden, a three-time America East 
Player of the Week in 2015, agreed. “I 
play this game because it’s a passion of 
mine and to be able to continue to play 
competitively after college is an honor,” 
he said.
Maloney said he found out about 
his selection in the draft when he was 
with his friends. “There was a lot of 
excitement,” Maloney said. “Not only 
did I get drafted, but my best friend 
and housemate Blaze Riorden was also 
picked, so there was a lot of celebrating.”
Maloney’s family was extremely 
happy and proud of him - the day in 
general was “pretty crazy” with all of the 
congratulatory text messages and phone 
calls pouring in. “It was really humbling 
to see all the people who went out of 

their way to congratulate me,” 
Maloney said.
Maloney said he is looking 
forward to competing against 
some of the best players in the 
world and having the chance 
to play alongside his childhood 
friends.
Riorden, who hails from the 
village of Fairport, N.Y. (about 
nine miles east of Rochester), was 
just as happy about his selection. 
When he heard his name called 
by the Rattlers, it felt especially 
awesome because of his ties to 
the Rochester area. “I grew up 
watching them play so it was a 
dream come true,” Riorden said.
The senior goalie is also 
looking forward to being a 
positive role model for the 
Rochester community.
Riorden said his mother is 
excited because she will be able 
to cook for him again since 
he’ll be so close to home. His 
father, who is yet to miss one 
of Riorden’s college games, is 
relieved because it means less 
travel for the family. 
But before the UAlbany seniors 
can start thinking about the 
pros, they have some unfinished 
business to take care of this 
season. UAlbany won its third-
straight America East Conference 
championship last year, but were unable 
to make it past the second round of the 
NCAA tournament, falling to Notre 
Dame, 14-10. 
For the first couple of hours after 
Maloney found out, it was hard to 
focus on the here and now. He said 
he was excited and actually had the 
chance to talk with his future coach 
and some teammates. But by the next 
day, Maloney said he was back and 
“100 percent” focused on the upcoming 

season. 
“I love this team and we have very 
high expectations for this season,” 
Maloney said. “So, until this season 
is over, I will put the pros in the 
background and lead our team as far as 
we can go, and then start thinking about 
my future.”
Riorden agreed.
“I am a Great Dane right now and 
that’s all I’m focused on. I owe it to my 
teammates and coaches to give it my all-
-day in, day out,” Riorden said.

Maloney and Riorden will be eligible 
to play in the MLL once UAlbany’s 
season concludes at the end of the 
spring.
UAlbany’s first game of the 2016 
season will take place at the Carrier 
Dome on Sunday, Feb. 21 at 4 p.m. 
They will face Syracuse, a team that beat 
the Great Danes in 2015 and finished 
the season at the number four position 
in Inside Lacrosse magazine’s end-of-
season rankings.

Maloney and Riorden to play 
professionally after season

The University at Albany track and field team is one 
of the school’s hidden gems. The men’s team is ranked 
fourth in the Northeast, while the women claim the 
eleventh spot, according to the U.S. Track & Field and 
Cross Country Coaches Association poll, which was 
released on Jan. 25. Because track and field is not a 
popular sport on campus in comparison to basketball and 
football, it is easy for UAlbany’s track and field stars to 
get lost in the shuffle.
Jonathan Eustache, a junior thrower from Rosedale, 
N.Y., won the men’s weight throw at the Upstate 
Challenge hosted by Cornell University on the weekend 
of Jan. 22. He won with a mark of 66’ 11.5’’ a score 
that placed him second overall in the America East and 
21st in the nation. He was named America East Field 
Performer of the Week with his performance at the 
Upstate Challenge. His throw broke the 65’ 6.25” school 
record set by Wilfredo De Jesus Elias back in 2011.
Eustache said his day starts at 6:30 a.m. He lifts with 
the team first thing in the morning followed by practice, 
class, and more practice. In the track and field event of 
throwing, the athlete is responsible for seeing how far 
he or she can throw a 16-pound ball that is attached to a 
handle with a 4-foot long chain. So to be successful in 
this sport, a big portion of Eustache’s success must be 
built in the weight room. For Eustache, his time is split 
between the varsity weight room and the PE gym where 
his team practices 
throwing. 
All of the time 
is geared toward 
accomplishing a 
singular goal this 
year: 
“To go to 
nationals,” 
Eustache said. “For 
the weight throw 
and nothing else. 
It’s possible and 
close and we’ll see 
how it goes,” 
Eustache said 
he commits every 
single day to his 
long-term goal 
of qualifying for 
Nationals. To get 

there, he said the most important part of being 
a thrower is trusting and understanding one’s 
body. 
UAlbany had another athlete rise to the 
challenge tournament at Cornell. Jordan 
Crump-King, a transfer junior (Hartford) 
holds the highest score in the northeast in the 
triple jump event after the Upstate Challenge 
meet where he achieved a distance of 50’ 9”.
Like Eustache, Crump-King wakes up 
early to start his day with a team lift. He 
receives treatment for any physical ailments 
from the UAlbany trainers, and then heads to 
practice, and class afterward.
Crump-King also stressed the importance 
of taking care of one’s body. 
“Lately after lifts, I’ve been doing my after 
treatment downstairs in the training room and 
working on my hamstrings to recover a bit 
quicker,” Crump-King said. 
Keeping the body healthy is essential in 
any sport. But in track and field, athletes 
exhaust the same muscle groups every day, 
so athletes like Crump-King understand 
receiving proper treatment from the training 
staff can go a long way. 
Also like Eustache, Crump-King puts a lot 
of pressure on himself to become the best at 
his craft.
“I just want to make my friends, family, 
and coaches proud and everyone happy,” 
Crump-King said. “To me it’s not much about 
me but more for the people I represent -- my 
school, coaches, and their hard work and 
dedication.” 
And for the rest of the student-athletes at 
UAlbany, Crump-King has a message:
“Give your all, anything that has your 
name attached to it,” advises Crump-King. 
“Label yourself as hard working, never to 
give up. I know that sounds so cliché but 
appreciate the process, the journey.”
“Stay motivated and optimistic throughout 
every competition and every practice. It’s 
important because you’re building character. 
Somewhere along the lines, you’ll become a 
champion.”

There are several gyms throughout the University 
at Albany campus, however one is specifically for the 
varsity athletes. When walking over to SEFCU Arena, 
it is common to hear anything from Taylor Swift to 
Fetty Wap blasting through the upstairs windows of 
the PE Building— that would be the weight room. It 
is open from as early as 6 a.m. to as late as the weight 
coaches decide to turn the lights off— it’s the space 
that never sleeps. The weight room is used for team 
lifts, individual lifts and is open to the athletic staff. 
It is rarely empty, nor quiet— the sound of weights 
pounding into the ground are accompanied with the 
strength and conditioning voices yelling and echoing 
throughout the two rooms. 
The strength and conditioning coaches are Connor 
Hughes (Director of Football and Men’s Basketball 
Strength and Conditioning), Tony Tullock (Assistant 
Director of Athletic Performance) and Bridget Pryal 
(Assistant Strength and Conditioning Coach) and AJ 
Levy (Strength and Conditioning Coach). Between the 
four of them they split up the different varsity teams 
they train: 
Connor Hughes: Football and Men’s Basketball 
Aj Levy: Track and Field, Baseball and Golf.
Bridget Pryal: Women’s Basketball, Women’s        
    Soccer, Women’s Lacrosse, Softball, Volleyball,     
    Cheerleading and Dance.
Tony Tullock : Men’s Lacrosse, Men’s Soccer,   
    Tennis and Women’s Track. 
All varsity team’s participate in some lifting 
program, however each team and sport differs. Many 
teams lift more off-season in preparation for their 
regular season. It is more difficult to schedule lifting 
times in the sport’s main season because often times the 
athlete’s are playing in multiple games a week. 
The importance of strength and conditioning is 
continuing to grow in terms of importance because it is 
now not just about becoming strong and powerful, but 
also about injury prevention. 
The Strength and Conditioning program at Albany’s 
mission statement is as follows: 
“The University at Albany Strength and Conditioning 
department is committed to improving athletic 
performance on the individual and team levels.  The 
department focuses on the proper development and 
combination of strength, power, speed, agility, mobility, 
conditioning and body composition to enhance 
performance in all athletic arenas.”
It is important to  note that most freshman student-
athletes come into college with no prior experience in 
lifting. It is always clear who the freshman are on teams 
because of the scrawny builds matched up against the 
upperclassman who put in multiple hours a week on 
building their muscle and fitness up. 
Bridget Pryal, who is responsible for coaching 
several of the women’s teams at UAlbany says that 
her main focus is making sure the athletes are staying 
injury free and strong all year round. With this in mind 
she says that her workouts are more or less the same 
throughout all the team’s she coaches. 
“Honestly I do the same exact stuff with all my 
athletes and teams. Total body exercises like squats, 
hang cleans and single leg stuff,” Pryal said.
Because Pryal mainly coaches the female teams 
she puts extra emphasis on firing certain muscles like 
hamstrings in particular. “With female athletes they 
have wider hips so are more susceptible to knee injuries 
so I try to build up those muscles with them,” Pryal 
says. However she says if she were to coach a men’s 
team she really wouldn’t change the workout routine 
much at all. 
Connor Hughes is the voice you often hear the 
most when entering the weight room— it’s loud, it’s 
demanding of attention and it’s just what is needed to 
train a football team year-round. Hughes said when the 
football team moved up a division to the CAA he didn’t 
change one thing about his program. The only thing that 
changed was the type of athlete the program brought in, 
which as a result just made the weight room numbers 
higher. 
The football team goes into the weight room multiple 

times a week, it is organized by position for when 
certain guys come in— because the weight room 
wouldn’t be able to fit everyone at once. Before “Spring 
Ball” the team is tested on their squat, hang clean, 
bench, vertical jump, 40-yd-dash and pro-agility which 
is 5-10-5 sprint test. 
These basic tests are used throughout most of the 
sports teams, however as you can imagine certain 
numbers should be higher than others depending on the 
sport and gender. 

The testing period in the weight room is used as a 
starting mark for an upcoming season, and an ending 
mark going into the summer where athletes are expected 
to keep up with their lifting routine. 
The weight room is an environment that not many 
people can picture— it’s run similar to a practice, the 
team is there and it is run by a coach, and in this case 
the strength and conditioning coach. For Pryal, she said 
she hopes that by showing the team’s she’s training that 
she is motivated and cares then eventually she hopes 
her athletes will buy in and see the importance of lifting 
like she does. 
For many athletes lifting can seem like a drag— it’s 
not the sport they fell in love with when they were 
younger and often it leave you sore with torn up and 
calloused hands. 
“When athletes start to see it all come together, I 
think that’s when they start buying into me and how 
important it is,” Pryal says.
Granted, coming together for one athlete could 
mean finding more success on the field, or a winning 
season— whereas for another it could be reaching that 
squat number that he or she never thought they would 
reach. 
Pryal believes that it’s what these teams do in the 

weight room that separates them from their opponents. 
When she motivates a team that is having a winning 
season she says, “Everybody is looking to get you, 
to beat you, you have to work harder than everybody 
else.” For a team that is having a losing season she 
tells her athletes to “forget about what just happened 
and focus on the next thing, the next task at hand. Push 
yourself today, because that little bit will help with the 
next competition.” 
These strength and conditioning coaches aren’t just 

there to tell the student-athletes to carbo load and throw 
around weights—they are also life coaches, inspiring 
these athletes to constantly better themselves.
Throughout the weight room banners of 
championships won by the UAlbany teams circle 
around the room, along with motivating quotes, 
nutrition tips, and daily tips. It could be seen as this: a 
reminder that what you accomplished is great, but there 
is always more to go after. So enjoy the championship 
banners but don’t ever get caught up—focus on the next 
task, the next year, the next weight.
Pryal says she enjoys training all of her teams, and 
said her job stemmed from just being a college athlete 
interested in fitness. Through her internships and 
volunteer work she began to realize she didn’t just love 
her job because of the working out part, but also how 
she was helping people every single day. 
A good team puts in the work behind-the scenes, 
and the weight room in the PE Building is where much 
of this after-hour work is put in. It’s sweaty, it’s often 
times defeating but it’s where it is okay to drop weights 
and fail—because the next time you will hit the rep, and 
you may be hanging a championship banner.
