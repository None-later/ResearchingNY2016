LABOR
UALBANY AND UUP REPORTS BEGIN TO 
FIGHT RELIANCE ON CONTINGENT LABOR

Contingent faculty are people who 
aren’t employed on a permanent 
or continuing basis - for example, 
a full-time lecturer who gets a 
contract for one year.
Provost James Stellar led 
a panel which looked into 
contingent staff at our school. 
The panel’s report, which was 
sent to President Robert J. Jones 
in October of 2015 and released 
online in November, includes 
many distressing figures, but also 
a few upshots and proposals to 
make things better. Unfortunately, 
Stellar couldn’t be reached for 
comment before deadline. 

Smoke Signals

The number of lecturers (part-
time and full-time) employed by 
UAlbany went from 376 to 535 

over four years, according to a 
dataset the panel received from 
Human Resources. Lecturers 
with 10-plus years of experience 
jumped from 98 to 181.
More classes and students are 
taught by contingent faculty. 
According to the same data, in 
the fall of 2014 more than half 
of lecture and seminar courses 
were taught by contingent faculty, 
which means 61 percent of all 
seats the university offered 
to students were taught by 
contingents.
The Albany Chapter of United 
University Professions had 
similar findings in its report on 
contingent labor, “Woven Into Its 
Very Fabric,” using a mixture of 
UAlbany data and data from the 
Modern Language Association 
(MLA). Tenure-line faculty teach 

36.5 percent of students, while 
non-tenure-line faculty teach 
63.5 percent, it said. It also 
found that most academic 
contingents are part-time - 26.6 
percent versus 8 percent.

Why is this a problem? 

Contingent faculty usually 
receive much less pay than 
tenure-line faculty and less 
stable paths to health insurance. 
Beyond material concerns, 
many contingent faculty 
and staff members feel less 
welcomed by the university 
and are often less informed about 
the university than their tenured 
counterparts. 
In UUP’s report, contingent 
faculty listed their top job 
concerns. The majority (76 
percent) marked “raising the per-
course minimum salary” as top 
priority. Here are the top five: 

1. Raising the per-course 
minimum salary (76 
percent)
2. Regular salary increases 
based on length of service 
(44 percent)
3. Ability to move into 
a position that has the 
possibility of tenure (40 
percent)
4. Ensuring health benefits 
(35 percent)

5. Longer contracts based 
on length of service (35 
percent)

Salary is important because the 
minimum pay rate at UAlbany is 
$2,800 for a three-credit course, 
and that hasn’t changed in over a 
decade. The national average is 
$2,987, reported by The Chronicle 
of Higher Education in 2013 using 
data from its data website, “The 
Adjunct Project.” The project 
also shows the wide variation in 
pay for adjuncts - some adjuncts 
reported making $1,000, while 
those at Harvard University make 
an average of $11,037. 
Adjuncts at UAlbany can only 
teach two classes. If they’re given 
two, they qualify for healthcare. 
Two classes per semester at 
$2,800 doesn’t make a very 

livable salary - it comes out to 
$11,200, which means they’d 
qualify for SNAP, New York’s 
food stamp program. 
Many adjuncts travel between 
campuses to work around the class 
limit. Rebekah Tolley, a fine arts 
professor at UAlbany, traveled 
between the Capital Region and 
SUNY Oneonta last year working 
as an adjunct. 
UUP surveyed contingents in 
November and December of 2014. 
From a pool of 496 people, a total 
of 38.5 percent responded. Using 
these responses, UUP estimated 
how many hours contingents work 
and thus their hourly pay.
The survey used self-reporting, 
really the only way to track hours 
for professors, so a completely 
accurate record isn’t possible.  

R

eliance on contingent faculty and staff 
has become a trend not only at the 
University at Albany, but in higher 
education at large in the United States. 
   In the fall 2013 semester, UAlbany ap-
pointed 535 new faculty members. The 
majority, 87 percent, were given part-time 
positions, and 73 percent got a job for one 
semester.

Some changes are being made to the 
original campus center reconstruction plan.
In an area near the 518 Market, around 
where Cusato’s Pizzeria and the H2O Zone 
used to be before construction began, a 
Starbucks will be added.
Stephen Pearse, director of Auxiliary 
Services at the University at Albany, said 
the decision to add a Starbucks is relatively 
new. 
“Originally we didn’t know what this was 
going to be” he said, “It was going to be 
more of a generic coffee station.”
Scott Birge, the director of Campus 
Center Management, said that Starbucks 
could affect other eateries on campus. 
“We may or may not keep Jazzman’s,” 
Birge said.
Bathrooms will be added near that 
location as well, including a women’s, 
men’s and family bathroom. 
The area that was originally supposed to 
be a two-story fitness center will now be 
made into something else entirely.
“The top part is now going to be a 
meeting room that will be a little larger than 
the Assembly Hall,” Birge said. “The bottom 
portion of it is going to be… a lounge.”
Birge explained that the lounge will have 
an open front. He hopes that there will be a 
bookshelf, board games, a television and a 
fake fireplace. 
The end date for the project has been 
extended. It was originally supposed to be 

finished by early 2017, but the expected 
completion date has now been pushed back a 
few months. 
“That got pushed back a little bit because 
of some of the changes that went on,” Birge 
said. 
The project is still expected to be finished 
in 2017. 
“That might be as early as January or it 
might be as late as the summertime,” Birge 
said. “The key is once the construction is 
complete, then there’s a whole lot of fitting 
out to do.”
He was referring to furnishing the new 
area, preparing the kitchen and making sure 
everything is ready for the grand opening. 
According to Pearse, once the building is 
ready the process of opening could take two 
to three months. 
The new addition will have a special place 
for ethnic food. Southeast Asian cuisine 
company Star Ginger has been confirmed 
for this location. There will be three separate 
styles of food.
“It’s got Thai cuisine, it’s got a noodle 
bowl and it’s got your more typical Asian 
- beef teriyaki, General Tso, that kind of 
stuff,” Pearse said.
The budget for the entire project, both 
reconstructing the original Campus Center 
and expanding it, is $62 million, which 
includes design, equipment, and asbestos 
removal costs.. The process is on budget 
according to John Giarrusso, associate 
vice president of finance for Facilities 
Management.

Science author talks 
relationships - animal 
and human

WRITERS INSTITUTE

By LINDSEY RIBACK

Just in time for Sexuality Month, 
University at Albany seniors 
gathered in their honors journalism 
class on Thursday for an exclusive 
opportunity to not only hear about, 
but also discuss the most recent work 
of Jennifer Verdolin, a behavioral 
scientist.
Verdolin is the author of “Wild 
Connection,” published in 2014, 
about dating and mating in the animal 
world and what it can tell us about 
our relationships. Despite a delayed 
flight into Albany, she managed to 
have enough time to not only discuss 
her work, which has been featured 
on BBC, National Geographic and in 

Smithsonian magazine, but the steps 
she had to take to get to where she is 
now.
Verdolin began by telling the room 
of 10 students that she made the 
decision to drop out of high school 
at the age of 16 after realizing she 
was not learning about the things 
she cared about. She began taking 
biology courses at a community 
college and after seeing a program on 
National Geographic about mountain 
gorillas, she decided that she wanted 
to study something she has always 
been interested in: animals. 
With her passion for primates 
in mind, Verdolin called as many 
scientists studying primates that 
she could before she received the 
opportunity to study capuchin 
monkeys in Argentina. 
“I get to Argentina. I was 
like, this is really nice to visit, 
but I do not want to follow 
monkeys around for 10 hours a 
day with 30 pound of bananas 
on my back,” the behavioral 
scientist said. 
Not a big fan of tropical 
rainforests, Verdolin decided 
to return to studying prairie 
dogs like she previously did 
for her master’s degree at 
Northern Arizona University.

and started to pursue her love of animals.Please see VERDOLIN page 2

ALBANY STUDENT PRESS

EDITOR: KASSIE PARISI
THEASP.EIC@GMAIL.COM

Bret Benjamin, president of UAlbany’s UUP 
chapter, said the number of hours “look a 
little high” to him, but the report notes that 
the results show “that contingent faculty 
subjectively feel themselves overworked, 
or to be working more than the 10-hour per 
week per course calculation that has been 
used to determine the percentage of their 
appointment.”
With that in mind, the median result shows 
that a lecturer estimates 268 hours of work 
per course per semester (about 14 hours per 
week when class is in session, and 11 hours 
for the weeks before and after) and has a 
median pay rate of $3,215.  
At this rate, a lecturer is making a median 
of $12 per hour. The full range is listed as 
$12 to $16 per hour.
“The point is that there’s real and 
valuable conversations about $15 an hour 
minimum wage everywhere and effectively 
we’re looking at people with Ph.Ds 
teaching at universities who are right at 
that point,” Benjamin said, “and that seems 
disproportionate and out of line with what we 
understand minimum wage work to be.”

Beyond the pay

Contingent faculty also feel less included 
in the university environment. UUP’s 
report highlights the lack of education and 
orientation given to contingents when they 
start at the university. Eighteen percent of 
part-time contingents did not know if they 
taught a General Education course or not, 
according to the report. Of the surveyed 
contingents, almost 40 percent didn’t know if 
they could get health benefits and 15 percent 
didn’t know if they had service obligations. 
“I think it’s just the ad hoc way that 
adjuncts are hired and utilized,” Benjamin 
said.
The contingency committee’s report 
also looked at workplace environment 
issues, surveying faculty and dividing 
them into subgroups of faculty versus staff 
and part-time versus full-time. The report 
found variability among answers, with 
generally positive reviews from faculty 
(although it noted there is “ample room for 
improvement”).
“Those other things… have to be 
addressed, but they’re secondary as far as I’m 
concerned,” Benjamin said. 

The solutions

The provost-led committee’s report lists 
14 recommendations. Regarding pay, it 

recommends raising the minimum per course 
rate to $5,000 over the next two to three 
years. 
When asked if he thought $5,000 per 
course is enough, Roberto J. Vives, the 
director of track and field who was on 
Stellar’s committee, said it isn’t, but “it is a 
move in the right direction.” 
The report also recommends asking deans 
and department chairs to try to assign two 
courses to contingents, so that they can get 
healthcare. Other recommendations include 
creating integration policies for contingents, 
creating a single place of information for 
contingents, providing a framework for 
longer-term employment, and establishing a 
Task Force to continue the committee’s work 
now that the report is published. 
“What is very important in the report is 
job security and moving those who have 
several years of good service to multi-
year appointments,” Vives said. “This 
illustrates confidence in your workforce and 
significantly improves the environment.”
The report recommends that contingent 
faculty and staff shouldn’t be given a 
position for less than one year when possible, 
and encourages giving contingents with 
good records multi-year commitments. It 
also says that part-time faculty should get 
appointments of increasing length and two 
courses per semester so they can receive 
healthcare, whenever it’s possible. Full-time 
non-tenure track faculty (FTNTT) “should 
be appointed for three years following three 
years of satisfactory service” if funding 
permits. Finally, the report says that FTNTT 
faculty should be able to “progress to 
permanence” after three years of “satisfactory 
service.” It is unclear where the funds for 
these paths to greater permanence would 
come from. 
Stephen North, a distinguished teaching 
professor in the English department and a 
member of the committee, said the committee 
framed it as an “issue of social justice.” 
“From my perspective, [calling it social 
justice meant] it trumped all the other 
priorities the university had,” he said. “If you 
say, ‘We are currently treating our employees 
unjustly and we admit it,’ you can’t keep 
continuing on in that way.”
Julie Novkov, chair of the department of 
political science, said the report “highlights 
the committee’s belief that developing fairer, 
more transparent, and more respectful ways 
of hiring, managing, and supporting our 
contingent faculty and staff is both a matter 
of simple justice and a critical step forward 
in creating a better learning environment for 
our students. I hope the report will enable 
UAlbany to become a leader on these issues.”
So far $400,000 has been allocated in the 
compact budget for 2015-16 to go toward 

raising contingent faculty pay. While it may 
be divided differently, assuming there are 
the same number of contingents the next two 
semesters as this (about 500), that comes out 
to $400 per person per semester. Another 
amount was put aside for graduate student 
assistantships. 
“I don’t think, at that level of funding, they 
get to their $5,000 in two to three years,” 
Benjamin said. 
“A lot will depend upon the state’s 
willingness to fulfill its civic obligation to 
support public education,” Novkov said. 
The Modern Language Association 
recommends a minimum per course rate of 
$7,000.
UUP’s report recommends a pro-rated 
salary portion of full-time Writing and 
Critical Inquiry lecturers, which comes out to 
$5,700 per course. To get 335 people at this 
rate, it would cost the university $1,215,576 
per semester, according to the report. The 
report puts this number in the context of the 
compensation costs for the 75 Management 
Confidential employees (the president, deans, 
provost, etc.), who made $12.2 million in 
2015. During the same year, 360 part-time 

lecturers collectively made $4.1 million.
UUP recommends a pro-rated number 
because it wants the university to stop 
depending on adjuncts, Benjamin said. If 
the university is spending the same on an 
adjunct as it would on a full-time, tenure-
track professor, then the system might switch 
back to pre-contingent reliance levels. UUP 
sees tenure as the solution to this problem, 
and wants to move back to the era when 
69.3 percent of faculty were tenure-line and 
only 30.7 percent were contingent (these 
percentages are from 1995 - now contingents 
make up 54.7 percent). 
“The committee’s report is far more 
substantive” than past reports, though, 
Benjamin said. “I think they see it’s in the 
university’s interest for a lot of reasons.” 
Members of the committee feel hopeful 
about the report, as well, but they also feel a 
sense of urgency. 
“I hope to see that if it’s not absolutely 
number one [on the list], that it’s in the top 
three on the list of priorities,” North said. “To 
me, it’s like a cancer. It will just erode this 
university from the inside out.”

Upon completing her Ph.D., she looked for a way to not 
only combine her interest in writing with her passion 
for science, but to also steer away from the technical 
and non-personal writing that scientific works typically 
entail. 
It was when a newly single Verdolin thought to 
herself, “Oh my gosh, I study social structure and mating 
systems in animals and I ended up making the worst 
choice. How is that possible?”
She explained that she took her experiences, both 
personal and professional, to Scientific American with 
the hopes of changing society’s way of thinking about 
animals from “this is how animals are like us to actually, 
this is why we are like them.”
Having read some of Verdolin’s articles on 
Psychology Today, senior Francesca McGuire asked her 
what aspect of animal relationships she enjoys writing 
about the most. 
Verdolin noted that when it comes to relationships 
we should be grateful to be human as opposed to other 
animals, “At least you’re not a praying mantis. Your 

head doesn’t get cut off.”
She ended her discussion explaining how amazing 
it is to her that the human species prides itself on its 
sophistication, yet it lacks the ability to effectively 
communicate in relationships, be them romantic or 
platonic. 
“If they [animals] are not communicating well they 
take a break,” she said. “They don’t keep beating the 
dead horse with a stick until everyone hates each other.”
Later that night, Verdolin re-shared her work and 
experiences with the rest of the UAlbany community at a 
free and public reading in the Campus Center. The New 
York State Writer’s Institute sponsored this event for 
their Visiting Writers Series in conjunction with Middle 
Earth Peer Assistance Program, University Counseling, 
and Psychological Services as part of Sexuality Month.

The Department of Residential Life at 
the University at Albany recently made 
some changes to the on-campus housing 
policy.
Freshman will still be expected to live 
on campus for the first year on either State 
Quad or Indian Quad. Now, students who 
were admitted as freshmen to UAlbany 
will also be expected to stay on campus 
their second year. These students will 
always be given a room on either Dutch 
Quad or Colonial Quad, but some 
sophomores will be able to stay on Empire 
Commons, Liberty Terrace, Freedom 
Apartments, or Alumni Quad, according to 
a spokesperson for ResLife. 
“It works out that Colonial and Dutch 
Quads have just enough space to provide 
our current freshmen to be housed as 
sophomores,” ResLife said in an email 
correspondence. 
After current freshman sign up for 
housing, upperclassmen can also live on 
Colonial and Dutch quads, according to 
UAlbany Director of Media Relations Karl 
Luntta. 
These changes to freshmen and 
sophomore housing do not affect students 
who commute.
“The policy is that if you live within 
50 miles of campus, you have the option 
of living at home and attending,” ResLife 
said.
Alumni Quad will now be available to 
more students.  
“We have added Alumni Quad to the 

choices this year for upper class housing 
selection,” Res Life said and later added, 
“Alumni Quad will still be used to house 
transfer and international students, there 
are no changes there.”
The changes are being made in order 
to make sure there is enough space for 
everyone on campus.
“When we have had a shortage of 
space in the past, this has impacted the 
new student areas,” ResLife said. “More 
so the freshmen quads, as we have had 
to increase rooms and occupy temporary 
areas.”
Upperclassman housing signup begins 
Feb. 22nd. Current freshmen may sign up 
beginning Feb. 29.

INCARCERATION EDUCATION

By DANIEL PINZON
A

n individual fresh out of prison 
really has nowhere to turn to.
Prisoners have negative 
connotations slapped on them by 
society. An ex-prisoner has to go around 
and remind themselves and others that they 
have been incarcerated, so employers see 
someone who is not worthy of employment.
   The Second Chance Pell Program was 
established in 2015 to give incarcerated 
individuals, who are due to be released 
in the next five years, grants for a college 
education starting this year.
Because society gives prisoners little 
to no value post-prison, it is fair that a 
criminal have access to basically a free 
college education.
   It should be noted that the majority 
of people who are incarcerated have 
committed drug offenses. According to 

BOP.gov, 46.5 percent (86,080) of inmates 
committed drug offenses last year. Drug 
offenses consist of possession for personal 
use, which is the majority of drug offenses, 
or intent to sell. These are relatively minor 
offenses to other criminal acts.
   In reality, we are giving people who 
had a little too much weed a second chance. 
   “Statistically speaking, most people 
that go to prison are from low-income 
neighborhoods and are in there for minor 
drug crimes, and to give them an education 
gives them a second chance [at] life,” 
Laura Evelyn said, a criminal justice major 
at University at Albany. “I’d rather have 
somebody come out educated and have a 
better shot [at] life than to come out and 
commit more crimes.”
   We must remind ourselves that a 
potential reason why criminals resort to 
crime in the first place is due to a lack of 
education, hence seeing crime as their only 

outlet to survive.
   The most an individual can get from 
this grant is $5,775, which is to be strictly 
spent on things required for the education 
program. 
   Whether we want to or not, Americans, 
as taxpayers, send taxes to the criminal 
justice system. So instead of paying to 
encourage incarceration as the only way 
to prevent crime, which doesn’t do so as 
effectively as we think, we might as well try 
and reform these criminals. 
   Incarceration doesn’t always prevent 
crime, which is what people want. We 
can put away as many law violators as we 
want in prison cells. It stops crime for that 
second, but will not necessarily stop crime 
in the future. Incarceration isn’t the only 
perceived crime prevention method. 
 Incarceration isn’t even the right 
correction method for some prisoners. Some 
are mentally ill, some are driven to crime 

as a last resort and some are convicted for 
some stupid act society deems as criminal 
activity. 
   The United States is known as the 
land of new beginnings and we should 
give prisoners the opportunity to reinvent 
themselves. If anything, this is something 
that can pull them away from doing crime.
   “America is a nation of second chances, 
giving people who have made mistakes in 
their lives a chance to get back on track and 
become contributing members of society is 
fundamental to who we are,” former U.S. 
Secretary of Education Arne Duncan said to 
PBS.org.  
   With the voice of society constantly 
reminding students that education unfolds 
opportunities, ex-prisoners are the citizens 
who need opportunities the most. A person 
pursuing education wants to be successful - 
anything other than being a convict.

’m so glad we live in a world 
where we’ve backtracked to 
denying proven science in 
favor of religion, celebrities and 
capitalism.
   Last month, rapper B.o.B. 
launched into a Twitter rant, saying 
that the Earth is flat and, in an 
even more bizarre turn of events, 
the “Airplanes” rapper released 
a song called “Flatline,” dissing 
astrophysicist Neil deGrasse Tyson, 
who had tweeted at B.o.B. that he 
was, in fact, wrong. 
   Tyson responded to the diss 
with a track of his own that he 
collaborated on with his nephew, 
and continued the dispute beyond 
Twitter when he freestyled on the 
late night talk show “The Nightly 
Show.”
   On the show, Tyson said that 
calculus and geometry prove that 
small objects on large curved 
objects will see those large objects 
as flat, which is why B.o.B. could 
not see the curvature of the horizon, 
which he had stated was proof the 
Earth was flat.    
   But there are ways to figure out 
the Earth is round. Some very 

obvious reasons include the ability 
to circumnavigate the globe, 
time zone differences and the 
disappearance of objects traveling 
over the horizon line. But I really 
don’t need to explain this to college 
students, the majority of whom 
have more scientific knowledge 
than I do.
   This is not a pressing issue, 
and bringing attention to it will 
probably only make it worse. But, 
what is worrisome is what this 
dispute signifies. 
   “There’s a growing anti-
intellectual strain in this country,” 
Tyson said before his mic drop. “It 
may be the beginning of the end of 
our informed democracy.”
 We all are entitled to free 
speech. But Tyson may be right 
about anti-intellectualism being 
on the rise. It’s not just “flat-
earthers” like B.o.B. and television 
personality Tila Tequila - our 
society allows those with some 
degree of power to make a 
scientific decision for us, even 
when they have no scientific 
authority.
In the past few years, laws have 
been passed in some states so that 
schools may teach Creationism, 

which is not a proven science. It, 
however, is a teaching that those 
certain religious groups are more 
comfortable with than a scientific 
fact that the Earth was not created 
in seven days. 
Presidential candidates and other 
politicians have denied the fact that 
climate change is real and stems 
from burning fossil fuels. Think 
tanks and propaganda machines 
have been created in order to deny 
that fossil fuels are, in any way, 
harmful in order to allow gas and 
oil companies to keep making 
more money. These people are 
not scientists. They have made 
these statements because it is more 
convenient and profitable.
Somehow, politicians and 
celebrities are getting the go ahead 
to make their own decision on how 
geography, meteorology, biology 
and physics work, and people are 
listening more to them than to what 
they were taught in school.
Scientists do not have the fan 
base of celebrities or the political 
and financial support of politicians. 
But someone who studies and does 
research to discover something 
deserves a little more support.

F

rench artist Olivier Ciappa decided that he wanted 
to portray homosexuality in a positive way. With 
his new photography exhibit, “Imaginary Couples,” 
or alternatively, “Couples of the Republic,” Ciappa 
takes heterosexual celebrities and has them pose as if they 
were in a homosexual relationship. This exhibit is already 
out in Paris and Lima, Peru, and is scheduled to come to the 
United States in the summer of 2016. 
   It is clear that Ciappas’ intentions are not harmful, 
and that he is trying to portray “peace and unity” in these 
couples. While Ciappa did capture photographs of some 
real homosexual couples, many of the photos are of French 
and American heterosexual celebrities, posing with others 
of the same gender. The exhibit helps bring positive 
publicity and combats the negative associations with 
homosexuality. However, if all of the couples who posed as 
homosexuals were indeed homosexual, the message would 
have been better.
   It’s not as if there’s a lack of homosexual celebrities. 
Many have their own partners or families and could have 
posed for this series of photographs.
   Screenwriter Francois Ozon and novelist Yasmina 
Bouraoui are both homosexual celebrities in France who 
could have easily sat for these photos. Yet this exhibit 
highlights straight celebrities, like actresses Eva Longoria 
and Alice David. It is taking the recognition for the LGBT 
cause away from the members of the LGBT community. 
There is no reason for Ciappa to have used mostly 
heterosexual celebrities for this project. 
   The pictures themselves are odd. While some of 
them portray loving, candid shots of families, others look 
downright uncomfortable. The models were in unnatural 
poses or staged in front of bright lights. 
   “The celebrities that I shot are heterosexual, but it was 
essential to me that you would believe these imaginary 
couples and families they portray were real,” Ciappa said to 
the Huffington Post.
   These staged photographs do not portray real families, 
and come across as nothing more than art pieces. This 
is completely the opposite of what Ciappa was trying 
to portray, and it could have been easily avoided by 
using actual gay people. It undermines what Ciappa says 
about the idea behind his exhibit: to portray real, loving 
relationships.

A LINK BETWEEN DATING AND DISEASES
Tinder providing STD testing locator to the app

Source: Denis Bocquet
Tinder is a very popular dating app, however it was criticized for enabling the spread of STD among its users.  It is now featuring a link to the site, Healthvana, which 
includes a free STD testing site locator for it’s users.

By KEVIN MERCADO
T

inder, a popular dating app used mostly for casual 
hookups, has added a new feature to ease the minds 
of those worried about spreading more than just 
love. 
   Due to recommendations from the AIDS Healthcare 
Foundation (AHV), Tinder has included a link to a 
healthcare site to provide its user with the option to locate 
free STD testing sites. 
   Public relations agency, CWR, distributed a press 
release explaining that Healthvana, the healthcare site 
now linked to Tinder, “is a cloud-based technology 
platform that improves communication between 
healthcare providers and their patients – leading to more 
efficient staff and happier patients.”
   AHV found a correlation between the app and a 
spike in STDs, and thus blamed the app for the increase 
and pushed for additional preventative information. 
   “In many ways, location-based mobile dating apps 
are becoming a digital bathhouse for millennials wherein 
the next sexual encounter can literally just be a few feet 
away — as well as the next STD,” AHV Public Health 
Division Senior Director Whitney Engeran-Cordova said, 
according to a CNSNews report. 
   The report also stated that “the Centers for Disease 
Control (CDC) reported that STDs were on the rise. 
According to the CDC’s data, cases of chlamydia, 
gonorrhea and syphilis had increased for the first time 

since 2006.” Tinder has about 50 million users according 
to a report from The New York Times.
   It’s good that Tinder has responded so positively 
to these accusations and it’s just as good that they have 
added these new features to ensure that its users are as 
safe as Tinder can allow them to feel. It is important 
that apps like Tinder provide the necessary resources to 
ensure safe sex because, strictly speaking, it is generally 
used for fast sex and easy hookups. 
 “Staying healthy in today’s dating world means 
getting tested regularly, practicing safe sex and having 
honest conversations about your HIV and STD status,” 
according to a Businesswire.com article, Healthvana 
CEO Ramin Bastani said. “Healthvana empowers people 
with actionable health information at their fingertips so 
they can make better decisions.”
   Healthvana seems to want to take a proactive 
approach in the spreading of information, as opposed to 
the spreading of disease. While this seems appealing, I 
have one question: Is this enough?
   It is a huge step for Tinder to allow outside 
information to be made readily available, but AHV seems 
to think that Tinder perpetuates an image that promotes 
careless sex, without second thought of the repercussions. 
   This thought was capitalized in the billboard 
advertisements that AHV plastered all across Los 
Angeles during the initial protests over Tinder. CBS 
News, among other news outlets, reported, “Billboards 
show a silhouette of a man labeled ‘Tinder’ face-to-

face with a woman’s silhouette labeled ‘chlamydia.’ 
A silhouette of a man labeled ‘Grindr’ faces a male 
silhouette labeled ‘gonorrhea.’”
   While I do not necessarily believe that there is a 
direct correlation between the app and STD increase, I 
do firmly believe that if there is a complaint that is easily 
repairable, then decisions should be made to take care 
of the problem. AHV had enough of a problem with the 
app to broadcast negative campaigns against Tinder and 
its homosexual equivalent, Grindr. That should be, and 
clearly seems to be, enough for Tinder to develop the 
necessary plans to solve the issue. 
   With an issue like STDs, Tinder needed to act 
fast. However, Healthvana simply isn’t enough. Tinder 
needs an entire marketing makeover and must cease to 
align itself with the idea that “dating” is equivalent to 
“hooking up” as well as the idea that being careless is 
O.K. In-house promotions that subconsciously promote 
safer sex could be an asset for the app as well as more 
information regarding safer sex practices. Letting people 
know about STD testing locations only helps, more so, 
after the act of unsafe sex has been committed. Tinder 
must approach safer sex practices prior to the action or 
require background checks in the form of STD diagnosis 
history or STD testing history (which, of course, may be 
too extreme) so that partners know exactly what they are 
agreeing to. 
   Healthvana is a small step for Tinder, but it’s not 
enough.

Donald Trump’s not-so-winning  streak

By LOUIS SMITH
A

s the sun rose on Feb. 2, it brought 
with it great news for any lover 
of freedom, common sense and 
liberty: Donald Trump had not won 
the 2016 Republican Iowa Caucus. 
However, it was also a reminder that it 
was time to face the grim reality that this 
dog-and-pony-show of an election was 
officially underway. 
   This stunning ballot result comes 
after the bold statements made by Trump 
on Jan. 31 to a crowd of supporters who 
had gathered in Council Bluffs, Iowa. 
   “We’re going to win, we’re going 
to win… we’re leading everywhere,” 
Trump said.
   Even with his rock-solid, yet simple, 
words of confidence, Trump couldn’t 
manage to coalesce the voters of Iowa, 
and instead, the Buckeye state chose 
slick-talking Texas Sen. Ted Cruz as 
the winner, who earned eight delegates. 
Trump finished second and earned seven 
delegates along with bright-eyed Florida 
Sen. Marco Rubio. 
   At this point, it is tough to determine 
whether Trump’s stunt of skipping out 
on the final Iowa debate attributed to the 
loss. After watching the debate, it was 
interesting to see how the candidates 
responded to having their statements and 
platforms scrutinized in real-time and 
watch them work to answer point-blank 
inquiries. This gave us voters a look at 
the real animals behind the masks of the 
presidential candidates and we caught 

glimpses of pure human emotions when 
they were questioned. The debate even 
showed Rubio and Cruz videos that show 
them supporting conflicting messages.
   In short, the seventh Republican 
Debate discussed topics of foreign 
policy, Medicaid, border security, 
radical Islam, and Obamacare. And to 
no one’s surprise, a little headway was 
made without the giant man-child Trump 
on stage making strange faces and 
lukewarm statements to eager viewers.  
   An interesting, yet not surprising 

development on the Republican trail was 
the document distributed internally on 
caucus day inside the Cruz campaign 
that read: “Breaking News. The press is 
reporting that Dr. Ben Carson is taking 
time off from the campaign trail after 
Iowa and making a big announcement 
next week. Please inform any Carson 
caucus goers of this news and urge them 
to caucus for Ted Cruz.” 
   Carson went public on Feb. 3 to 
voice his side of the story. The New 
York Times reported that he had been 

planning on returning to Florida the next 
day after the caucus to retrieve clean 
clothes. 
   Carson then went on to add, “It’s 
clear that there were people who tried to 
take advantage of a situation and tried to 
distort information.”
   Dirty tricks aside, America 
watches on as the GOP continues to 
sluggishly trudge ahead, with no signs 
of unification on the horizon. Rand Paul, 
Rick Santorum and Mike Huckabee 
have dropped their bid, which still 
leaves a bloated nine-candidate ticket 
for the voters of New Hampshire, and 
potentially South Carolina, to deal with.  
   On the opposite side of the fence, 
Hillary Clinton barely edged out the 
always haggard-looking Bernie Sanders 
by a fraction of a percent. Clinton 
received 49.9 percent whereas Sanders 
received 49.6 percent of the votes. As 
compared to the disorganized GOP 
ticket, it is quite depressing that the 
Democrats don’t have better qualified 
candidates than an aging Environmental 
Hawk who’s also a self-proclaimed 
Socialist and a crooked former faux-New 
York State Senator.
   Even though late-night talk show 
hosts and comedians would have people 
believe all this political uncertainty 
and shadiness is entertaining, those of 
us who are gravely concerned with the 
future welfare of this great nation see 
this upcoming election as one of pinnacle 
importance.

EXHIBIT

By ELIOR MOSKOWITZ

The University Art Museum opened its new exhibit, 
“Gerard & Kelly,” last Tuesday, Feb. 2, hosting 
acclaimed artists Brennan Gerard and Ryan Kelly, 
whose multidisciplinary works address questions of 
“sexuality, collective memory, and the formation of queer 
consciousness.” 
The presentation given on Thursday, Feb. 4 by Gerard 
and Kelly commenced with a live demonstration of their 
piece, “Timelining,” which was first presented as part of a 
solo exhibition at The Kitchen, New York, and later as part 
of an exhibition at the Guggenheim Museum in New York 
City in 2015. The piece consisted of the two artists circling 
the room in seemingly candid circles, simultaneously 
discussing personal events that converged only with the 
prepositional phrase “in front of.” 
The piece examined the binding force of memory 
both to one’s own narrative and to one another, while 
also exploring the elastic nature of time in its often non-
chronological patterns that weave in and out of one’s life. 
Themes of desire for belonging and kinship relations were 
directly investigated and leveraged through the instrumental 
featuring of performers who fell on all spectrums of 
intimacy. 
Their subsequently presented pieces, “Kiss Solo” 
(2011) and “Reusable Parts/Endless Love” (2012) were 
created in the image of Tino Sehgal’s work, “Kiss” (2010), 
displayed at the Guggenheim Museum in 2010. These 
pieces inquisitively deconstruct the heteronormative nature 
of Sehgal’s piece. In the former, a single actor performs the 
choreography described from Sehgal’s work, shifting and 

combining pronouns in response to the text, retelling the 
intimate steps of the kiss in his own voice. 
The latter piece includes the swapping of partners, 
moving the construction and focus of the piece beyond that 
of individual identities through its procedural, minimalist 
approach. The artists affirm that their goal was not to create 
a spectacle, but instead to question representations of love 
in how they are produced, narrated and consumed. 
These pieces were just a select few of the artists’ 
provocative repertoire, including other works such as 
“P.O.L.E. (People, Objects, Language, Exchange)” (2014), 
“Two Brothers” (2014), “Reverberations” (2015) and 
“Transcripts” (2014), which raise social commentary 
regarding our interactions with history, subjectivity and 
resistance. 
The politics of intimacy were a pervading theme of the 
artists’ work, examined in multidimensional contexts. The 
artists describe the effects on the ego in relation to intimate 
exchange to be of particular interest to them, as well as the 
ironic implications of distance and discomfort that intimate 
acts can forge for a person. 
Gerard and Kelly’s expressive and innovative works 
present stirring commentary regarding identity, personal 
narrative, and relations of objectivity and subjectivity that 
underlie and universally pertain to the human experience. 
The performance installation, “Reusable Parts/Endless 
Love,” will be presented on Friday, Feb. 12 at 7 p.m. at the 
UAlbany Performing Arts Center after a reception from 
5-7 p.m. at the University Art Museum.  A video exhibition 
displaying the artists’ work over the past five years will 
be screened as a single-channel video projection at the 
University Art Museum until April 2.

Grease: Live is still the word in 2016!

By LAMYA ZIKRY

Fox’s much anticipated “Grease: LIVE!” which aired on  
Jan. 31, was exceptionally good. It was Broadway meets 
Hollywood: a combination of the original 1971 musical 
“Grease” and its Paramount Pictures’ 1978 film adaptation, 
although it was more cinematic than theatric.
There is no comparison to the original, but it should 
not be seen as a remake. Even with rain trying to get in 
the way and a technical sound error, the live performance 
was still a hit. It reintroduced and re-imagined the classic 
musical numbers as well as including a few original 
numbers. 
New girl Sandy and bad boy Danny Zuko were played 
by Julianne Hough and Aaron Tveit. Hough is known for 
her roles in “Footloose,” “Rock of Ages” and as a judge 
on “Dancing with the Stars” and Tveit for his roles in “Les 
Miserables” and “Graceland.”
The production opened with Jessie J singing “Grease (Is 
the Word)” throughout the soundstage and then out into the 
rain. Boyz II Men were also in the opening, performing in 
the background. They later returned for their rendition of 
“Beauty School Dropout,” a song I no longer feel the need 
to fast forward through. The set and the costumes were 
perfect and stayed true to the ’50s era setting. 
Hough was a good fit for Sandy - some would say she 
even looks like Olivia Newton John. She used her dancing 
roots to nail the dance numbers. Hough also honed her 
singing skills and gave a great rendition of “Hopelessly 
Devoted to You.” 
Tveit channeled his inner John Travolta and nailed 
the Danny Zuko facial expressions and his “Greased 
Lightning” performance. Tveit may not have had the 
strongest voice but he knew how to play the part. Although 

there wasn’t that much intimacy between the two, their 
dance number was a hit until ChaCha (Yvette Gonzalez-
Nacer) steals Danny for the rest of the dance.
The Pink Ladies were led by Vanessa Hudgens, who 
played the role of bad girl Rizzo. Hudgens is known for her 
roles in “Gigi” on Broadway, “Spring Breakers” and “High 
School Musical.” Keke Palmer, from “Scream Queens” 

and “Akeelah and the Bee,” played the role of the sassy 
flirtatious Marty Maraschino. Carly Rae Jepsen, known 
for her hit song “Call Me Maybe” played the beautician 
wannabe, Frenchy. Kether Donohue from “Pitch Perfect” 
played Jan.
Hudgens stole the show - there was no performance 
quite like hers. Her father had just died the night before 
from stage-four cancer, so she dedicated her performance 
to him. She was both remarkable and memorable. She’s a 
very talented actress and performer, and you could feel the 
passion in her performance of “There Are Worse Things I 
Could Do.” Ironically enough, the original song performed 
by Stockard Channing wasn’t a favorite, while Hudgen’s 
version certainly is. 
Unlike NBC musicals, they weren’t trying to hide that it 
was a live performance. Viewers could see the cast zipping 
from stage to stage on golf carts and running around 
backstage. The drag race at the end was created using 
smoke and light trucks and several different camera angles, 
which made for a somewhat convincing scene. 
Palmer’s “Freddy, My Love,” a song added to the 
production from the original Broadway hit, stunned 
viewers and transformed Palmer into an absolute star. A 
strong number with a quick and simple costume change 
gave the viewers a little more insight into who Marty was. 
While Frenchy’s song “All I Need Is An Angel” was not 
what viewers expected, she still gave a good performance.
“Grease: LIVE!” was in production for more than six 
months and involved more than 300 people. The teasers on 
social media made the production look easier than it truly 
was. But when you watch it, it shows just how much time 
and effort were put into making it all look effortless. With 
the final scenes and the “We Go Together” performance, 
the excitement and energy is not just acted - it’s real.

COMEDY 

By JULIA DAY 

“Cut. It. Out!”
If you’re familiar with the widely popular ‘90s sitcom 
“Full House,” you’ll know whose famous catchphrase that 
is. Comedian and actor Dave Coulier, known for his role 
as Joey Gladstone, visited Albany on Friday, Feb. 5 to 
perform stand-up to a sold out crowd at The Funny Bone. 
From awkward airport encounters to bizarre bathroom 
mishaps, Coulier dished it all during his performance.
Although best known for his role on “Full House,” 
Coulier has had a long and varied career. Born in Michigan, 
Coulier grew up with a love for comedy and developed a 
skill for impersonations. Coulier also played on his varsity 
hockey team in high school. 
“I was always the funny guy in the locker room and 
when you get 20 guys sitting around, you have a captive 
audience,” Coulier said in a Buzzfeed interview.
At the age of 19 Coulier moved to California to pursue 
his comedy career. While discussing his start as a comic, 
Coulier referred to himself as a “professional copycat” 
during the show, banking on his ability to do hilariously 
impeccable impersonations. His voice talents scored him 
various roles in the ‘80s, doing voice work for cartoons 
including “Ghostbusters,” “Muppet Babies,” “Scooby and 
Scrappy-Doo” and “The Jetsons.”
Coulier got his big break when he auditioned for “Full 
House” in 1987. Little did he know the show would go on 
to have eight seasons from 1987 to 1995, accrue millions of 
viewers, and attain worldwide syndication. 
When describing the money he makes on “Full House” 
residuals, Coulier joked, “I don’t want to brag, but it’s 
enough to buy a T-shirt every week. Maybe even a long 
sleeve.”
Since then, Coulier went on to host “America’s Funniest 
People,” tour with comedy troupe Duck’s Breath Mystery 
Theater and do voice acting for “Robot Chicken” and “Bob 
& Doug.”
Flash forward to 2016, and Coulier has been touring the 
country performing stand-up. Coulier previously performed 
University at Albany students in October of 2014.
Performing on both Friday and Saturday night, 
Crossgates Mall was packed with long lines of people 
waiting to see Coulier’s performance. He didn’t disappoint. 
“It was my first time at a comedy club and Coulier and his 
warm up act really had me in tears the whole way through,” 
UAlbany student Erik Scheltinga said.
As the opening act, comedian Nate Weatherup warmed 
up the audience, opening his bit solemnly with, “I recently 
lost my best friend…” following with “he got married.” 
When describing his image as a child of the Underground 
Railroad being an actual underground railroad with Harriet 
Tubman acting as the conductor, Weatherup said “I’m not 
sure which direction I was going with that joke… but it’s 
probably north.”
Following Weatherup, Coulier stormed the stage, 
wearing a Detroit Red Wings hockey jersey. His set 
certainly did not disappoint. Coulier took the stage for 
nearly an hour, jam-packed with jokes. 
His impersonations ranged from SpongeBob 
Squarepants, Patrick Star, Bill Clinton, Robin Williams and 
Tom Hanks, among others. He joked that Scooby-Doo and 
Shaggy would make good airport security guards, having a 
keen nose for the scent of marijuana. At one point, Coulier 
impersonated Matthew McConaughey’s Texas drawl, 
saying “I’m Matthew McConaughey,” while pretending to 
undo his shirt.
He told the audience of an awkward chili encounter he 
had with Arnold Schwarzenegger at a picnic, where he 
accidentally spilled chili on Schwarzenegger’s shirt while 
laughing. Years later, he ran into Schwarzenegger in a hot 

tub on vacation in Hawaii, and immediately thought, “The 
Terminator’s here to kill me.” Referencing other celebrities, 
Coulier commented on his friendship with Bruce Jenner, 
saying “I knew Bruce Jenner… up until about eight months 
ago.”
Coulier talked about his dad’s “prejudice” towards men 
with long hair, and his assumption that they do drugs. He 
also talked about his son’s ability to play Xbox games all 
day, while the best he could do is Super Mario.
When an unsuspecting audience member got out of his 
seat during the show, Coulier jumped at the opportunity 
to make a joke. “That’s a poop walk,” said Coulier as he 
headed to the bathroom.
Coulier talked about a recent “miracle” he experienced in 
a Chicago bathroom, during which one of the people in the 
bathroom farted so loudly that they set off the paper towel 
dispenser. 
“You can’t choose where your miracles happen to you,” 
he said.
To conclude the show, Coulier played some blues beats 
on his harmonica accompanied by funny inaudible vocals. 
He also did his popular “water sprinkler” bit, where he spat 
water onto the stage while turning full circle.
“I was pleasantly surprised when he pulled out a 
harmonica towards the end of the act, and even more 
surprised by how skillfully he played it,” said UAlbany 
student Sarah Sabin. “It was certainly a memorable night.”
Coulier will be reprising his role as Joey in the Netflix 
original series, “Fuller House,” which will premiere on 
Feb. 26. His stand-up tour, along with his appearance on 
the “Fuller House” spin-off, shows that Coulier is back and 
better than ever.

ALBANY’S FUNNY BONE 

MOVIES

By DIEGO CAGARA 

Zombies have become a commercial plot device in 
today’s pop culture. Because they typically appear in 
contemporary contexts, it can be startling to imagine them 
wreaking havoc in a historical time period instead. But 
that happens with Burs Steers’ directorial effort, “Pride 
and Prejudice and Zombies.” Viewers are treated to an 
unusual juxtaposition of gore, romance, period drama and 
comedy - which surprisingly works.
Adapted from Seth Grahame-Smith’s 2009 book 
of the same name which was based on Jane Austen’s 
1813 classic, “Pride and Prejudice,” the movie is set in 
early 19th century London where a mysterious virus, 
revealed to have arrived at England’s shores via ships, 
has caused people to turn into brain-hungry zombies. 
The film centers on Elizabeth Bennet (Lily James) who 
simultaneously struggles with her growing feelings 
for Mr. Darcy (Sam Riley) and surviving the zombie 
apocalypse. While some may perceive the film as a 
corruption of Austen’s literary work, the injection of 
zombies into the lives of England’s landed gentry is 
certainly intriguing yet comical.
Having both become proficient zombie slayers, 
Mr. Darcy’s cold, judgmental and walled-up exterior 
immediately clashes with Bennet’s more lighthearted 
and hopeless romantic nature. Even in a universe where 
young women are trained to wield swords, guns and their 
bare fists to defend themselves, the light of feminism 
is not that bright yet as women are still expected to be 
married off to bachelors, something Bennet disagrees 

with. She would 
find herself in a kind 
of love rectangle 
as she rejects three 
men’s consecutive 
proposals, including 
Mr. Darcy, because 
she feels like she has 
not quite found the 
one yet.
While Bennet 
inadvertently falls 
for Mr. Darcy by 
the end, she and her 
sisters, Jane (Bella 
Heathcote), Kitty 
(Suki Waterhouse), 
Lydia (Ellie Bamber) 
and Mary (Millie Brady) mostly have no trouble fending 
off the undead. There is a brilliant scene near the film’s 
introduction where Bennet and her sisters are walking 
down an infested hallway, chopping off, slicing, stabbing 
and basically dismembering zombies around them, all in a 
Charlie’s Angels-esque slow-motion sequence. 
The fight scenes throughout look almost nonsensical 
and erratic yet it proves how Steers’ direction helps 
the film skate just comfortably between carnage and 
comedy. With blood and brains often splattering while 
staining dresses and breeches, one can’t help but feel a 
sense of adrenaline. The film is not meant to be taken too 
seriously since its source material is a parody of Austen’s 

acclaimed book, but it is just strong enough to stand on 
its own. As someone who has never read either Austen’s 
or Grahame-Smith’s books, I was still able to understand 
what was going on, thanks to the characters’ sharp wit 
and exhilarating action sequences. 
However, it felt a little rushed as all at once zombies 
flooded the big screen, Bennet and Mr. Darcy struggled 
to express themselves, and Bennet, a hardcore zombie 
repellent, simply settled down for marriage. Nevertheless, 
the film exceeded my low expectations as I had assumed 
that a movie that juggles romance, gore and the undead 
would just result in a mess. It may not be the most 
thought-provoking film of the year, but it certainly is 
entertaining.

Usually people between ages 18 and 20 are either 
starting college, working or just going about their day 
thinking what to do next. Not 20-year-old psychic-
medium, Tyler Henry, who connects with spirits in his 
new hit reality show, “Hollywood Medium,” which 
aired Sunday, Jan. 24 on E!  During the season premiere, 
Henry performed reading sessions for NBA player John 
Salley, TV Personality NeNe Leakes, and actresses Jaime 
Pressly and Bella Thorne.  The following week’s episode 
shows Henry’s session with TV personality Snooki from 
“Jersey Shore.” 
Henry begins his sessions by either receiving 
impressions from a personal object brought by the client 
or through a spirit that just connects with him instantly. 
Connections begin when the spirit shows him “random 
images and symbols.” Using a notepad, Henry sketches 
these symbols and writes down words and numbers to 
effectively deliver the message from the spirit. 
Henry first appeared on a “Keeping Up with the 
Kardashians” episode before his season premiere aired. 
He performed a reading for Khloe Kardashian while 
Kendall Jenner witnessed him connect with Khloe’s 
father, Robert Kardashian. Henry shocked Khloe and 
Kendall when he brought up a significant date in July, 
which turned out to be Robert’s anniversary with Kris 
Jenner.
The season premiere opened with Henry’s mom 
driving him to his appointment. Celebrities book 
appointments through Henry’s manager, Ron, who 
provides Henry with only an address – no names. 
This prevents beforehand knowledge of the client and 
eliminates skepticism. When Henry arrived to his first 
location, actress Jaime Pressly welcomed him to begin 
his session. He connected with Pressly’s grandmother by 
referring to her as “talkative” and the name, “Mary.” 
In a sense, being a medium is like putting a puzzle 
piece together to reveal the final picture. Henry revealed 
to John Salley that when he connects with the spirit, he 
opens his mind to images and symbols, and “downloads 
a bunch of information.” Henry said that he sets his 
intentions to connect with the spirit and mentally receives 
pieces of imagery to interpret. Once everything processes, 
he delivers the message to the client to create meaning of 
it all. 
“I wanted to help people in their last moments and 
comfort them, and then my medium career took off,” said 
Henry. 
During his reading for Nene Leakes, Henry 
experienced “Medical Mediumship” which is when he 
goes through the process of someone’s death and takes on 
their physical symptoms. Things got super intense when 
Henry connected with Leakes’ mother.
Henry’s sessions almost always provide his clients 
with comfort and closure. He reassures that their loved 
ones are at peace and are watching over them. It’s pretty 
clear that Henry touches the lives of these celebrities 
when a few sessions ended with tears of joy.
“Hollywood Medium” leaves audiences amused by his 
peculiar talent. Although it’s unknown whether Henry’s 
connection with spirits is genuine, the suspense is worth 
feeling. Skeptics may question whether Henry and these 
celebrities are paid to put on a show, but it’s up to the 
audience to decide if he’s the real deal.

STUDENT LIFE

By KELSEY LUKE

The life of a student-
athlete is hectic, leaving 
little time to focus on 
anything other than sports 
and schoolwork. The 
Student-Athlete Advisory 
Committee (SAAC) is an 
organization that each year 
tries to alleviate this stress 
on student athletes. It also 
tries to help them become 
positive and well-rounded 
individuals, both on and 
off the field. 
The committee serves 
as the voice of all student-
athletes and representatives 
receive encouragement 
to “provide insight on the 
student-athlete experience 
and offer input on the 
rules, regulations and 
policies that affect student-
athletes’ lives on campus,” 
according to NCAA.com. 
SAAC is an NCAA-
affiliated committee 
comprised of only student-
athletes. At the nationwide 
Division-I level—which 
the University at Albany 
participates in—one 
student-athlete from every 
school in the 32 athletic 
conferences is selected 
to represent his or her 
respective school. 
In addition to sending 
one of its own student-
athletes to SAAC to 
represent the school at the 
national level, UAlbany 
is one of many across the 
nation who has its own 
SAAC branch made up 
of only UAlbany student-
athletes.
This year, more so than 
in the past, UAlbany’s 
SAAC affiliate is focused 
on ensuring a fulfilling 
college experience for all 
student-athletes.
“A role [SAAC] 
plays here at Albany is 
promoting a positive 
image of student-athletes 
in the community and 
Capital Region with 
different community 
service initiatives, events 
or projects,” said Justin 
Berger, senior lacrosse 
player and president of 
UAlbany’s SAAC. 
The group has 
participated in multiple 
community service projects 
and plans to continue 
to do so in the future. 
From toiletry drives to 
conference-wide food 
drives, UAlbany’s SAAC 
works to show that student-
athletes can be leaders and 
helpful members in the 
community outside of their 
sport.
 “When we go out and 
donate a ton of toiletries 
to a homeless shelter 
downtown, we hope people 
see it and say, ‘Those 
kids stand for something 
good,’” said Berger.
On a national level, 
SAAC’s primary 

discussion centers around 
the time demands on 
the lives of student-
athletes. Student SAAC 
representatives throughout 
the country are pressing 
for policies that will give 
student-athletes more 
time outside of class and 
practice so they can help in 
the community, receive a 
sufficient amount of sleep, 
and have a balanced social 
life. 
“It’s about making 
sure that it is a healthy 
relationship between 
athletics, studying, and 
everything in-between,” 
Laini Leindecker, UAlbany 
volleyball player and 
SAAC vice president, said.
D-I athletes spend 
approximately 40 hours a 
week completing school 
work and going to class. 
An additional 40 - more or 
less - are spent on activities 
related to their sports. 
This leaves little time for 
any activities outside of 
academics and athletics.     
“SAAC is trying to 
find time for our student-
athletes to be students,” 
said Carl Anderson, 
associate athletic director 
for Student Services at 
UAlbany. 
The student-athletes at 
the D-I level collectively 
decided that strict time 
demands need to be looked 
at further, via a survey 
administered by the NCAA 
that had approximately 
28,000 responses. 
The NCAA is listening 
to the student-athletes of 
SAAC. 
“When we walked 
in, and the people that 
matter actually listened 
and actually cared about 
what we had to say, was 
incredibly inspiring,” 
Berger, who represented 
UAlbany earlier this 
year at the 2016 NCAA 
Convention, said. “The 
SAAC is driving the 
conversation. When 
change goes into effect 
next year, it’s going to be 
because SAAC did all of 
the legwork and all of the 
brainwork, which will be 
a really cool thing to be 
proud of.”
Berger is proud of the 
strides SAAC has made 
this year. He believes as 
long as the nation has 
student-athletes committed 
to the group—like 
he knows there are at 
UAlbany—it “can only get 
bigger and better.” 
SAAC’s next event is 
scheduled for Feb. 25, 
where it will help promote 
the “You Can Play” project 
at the women’s basketball 
game. The project works 
to ensure that all student-
athletes receive equal 
respect and treatment, 
regardless of their sexual 
orientation.

BASKETBALL
LEGENDS AT THE BIG PURPLE GROWL

By TROY FARKAS

On a night that the 
University at Albany 
honored its men’s basketball 
legends, a packed Big Purple 
Growl crowd at SEFCU 
Arena witnessed a vintage 
performance from the Great 
Danes’ current legends in the 
making.
 UAlbany squeaked by 
Vermont Saturday night, 
75-71, after fighting off a 
lackluster first half behind 
senior co-captains Peter 
Hooley and Evan Singletary. 
The win moved the Danes 
– currently second in the 
America East standings – to 
19-6. The Danes are seeking 
their fourth consecutive trip 
to the NCAA Tournament.
 The 2005-06 team 
was honored in pre-game 
festivities Saturday. That 
squad nearly became the first 
16th-seeded team to beat a 
No. 1 seed in the tournament. 
The team, which featured 
Jamar Wilson -- the Great 
Danes’ all-time leading 
scorer -- started a trend, 
becoming the first UAlbany 
team to win the America East 
tournament since jumping 
to the Division I level in 
1999. In 2006, the Danes led 
top-seeded Connecticut by 
as many as 12 points in the 
second half, but eventually 
fell 72-59.
 Fast forward 10 years: 
On Saturday, after a first half 
that saw Vermont shoot 67 
percent from the field, senior 
guard Hooley was disgusted 
with how the Danes played 
after trailing 41-31 heading 
into halftime.
 “At halftime we took a 
hard look at ourselves. We 
were really disgraced with 
how we played,” Hooley said. “I 
think we had no energy. In a game 
like this you really need to have 
energy.”
 Coach Will Brown took a 
surprisingly calm approach to 
motivating his team in the locker 
room.
 “I think they expected me to 
throw things off the wall, yell, 
scream, threaten with practice 
at 6 a.m. tomorrow. But I said 
to myself ‘Let’s see if I can fool 
‘em,’” Brown said.
 The Danes came out roaring in 
the second half behind the stellar 
play of Hooley and Singletary. 
The duo finished the game with 
20 points each. All of Singletary’s 
came in the second half.
 Hooley and Singletary 
singlehandedly brought UAlbany 
back into the game. The two were 
the only UAlbany players to score 
in the first seven minutes of the 
second half, cutting the deficit to 
two points in the process.
 A Hooley three sent SEFCU 
Arena into a frenzy with 11 
minutes left, which gave UAlbany 
its first lead since 7:47 remained 
in the first half. The Danes looked 
ready to pull away after going up 

by seven points with 7:29 left, but 
the Catamounts had other plans.
 Vermont, fourth place in the 
America East, clawed its way 
back to a 70-68 deficit after a 
three-pointer from Ernie Duncan, 
who finished with a game-high 
23 points. On the next possession 
following a Hooley missed lay-up, 
the Catamounts regained the lead 
on an old-fashioned three-point 
play from Cam Ward, who put 
the visitors ahead 71-70 with 1:48 
left.
 Four consecutive free throws 
by Singletary put the Great Danes 
in front by three points with 45 
seconds left. Ward’s three-point 
attempt on the next possession 
missed long, and UAlbany’s Mike 
Rowley grabbed the rebound 
before passing to Hooley, who 
was fouled. He missed both free 
throws, but Vermont’s Duncan 
was unable to convert from deep 
to tie the game. One more free 
throw from Greig Stire sealed the 
win for the Danes, who remain 
undefeated at home on the season.
 After a great first half for the 
Catamounts, Vermont was unable 
to make the plays it needed to 
upset the Great Danes in front of a 
SEFCU crowd of 4,538.

 “We battled in there. We 
played really well in the first 
half,” said Vermont Head 
Coach John Becker. “They’re a 
championship team. They had a 
great crowd here tonight.”
 Hooley and Singletary agreed 
it was the loudest they’ve ever 
heard SEFCU Arena, besides the 
victory over Stony Brook in the 
America East championship game 
last March.
 For Brown, this game also 
was about putting on a strong 
performance for the 2005-06 team 
that paved the way for all the 
success the UAlbany basketball 
program has enjoyed in the past 
decade. Brown said that when he 
addressed his team at halftime, he 
told them, “Guys, all I’m asking 
you is to respect the 2005-2006 
team that built this program. I 
need you to play the way they 
played.”
“Six turnovers, getting to the 
line 37 times, out-rebounding 
by eight -- that’s how you win 
games,” Brown said.
 Singletary was also able to step 
up when the team needed him.
 “We were all struggling in the 
first half,” Hooley said. “It’s the 
sign of a true leader to step up. 

He’s shown that he can in the last 
year and a half.”
 “I was surprised when he came 
out and wasn’t aggressive and had 
zero at the half,” Brown said of 
Singletary. “You saw how good 
he was in the second half. And we 
needed that.”
 The purple and gold will 

need similar performances from 
Singletary if the Danes hope to 
reach the NCAA tournament for 
the fourth consecutive year.
 “We know what’s on the line 
in terms of standings. Good teams 
win at home. Great teams find a 
way to win on the road,” Hooley 
said.

LACROSSE

By MICHAEL TURAY

The University at Albany men’s lacrosse 
team kicked off its 2016 campaign by 
hosting Colgate University in a preseason 
tune up Saturday at John Fallon Field. 
Despite cold conditions and a chronic wind 
chill, fans were thrilled to get a chance 
to cheer on their Great Danes who are 
ranked 12th in this year’s preseason USILA 
Coaches Poll.
The Danes are coming off yet another 
successful year under the helm of Coach 
Scott Marr who led the team to a record 
of 16-3, including a third straight America 
East Conference title. The Danes defeated 
Cornell in their opening round game in 
last years NCAA Tournament, only to fall 
to No. 1 seed Notre Dame 14-10 in the 
quarterfinals.
UAlbany started the game strong by 
scoring four unanswered goals and taking a 

commanding lead. The offense was spread 
and many different players were getting 
minutes. It looked as if the Great Danes 
were going to effortlessly win this one, but 
Colgate found their rhythm and came back.
Penalties costed the Great Danes and 
Colgate was able to convert goals on 
multiple man-down situations. 
“I think something we need to work on 
is not taking as many penalties, because 
we went up 4-0 and then we took some 
penalties that let them back in the game,” 
said sophomore attack Connor Fields. 
Fields scored two goals in the seesaw 
affair. After some spotty first half defense, 
the team looked sharp coming out of 
halftime and held Colgate scoreless in the 
third period. 
“I think we played well as a team 
yesterday. We set the tempo early going up 
4-0 within four minutes, which is huge,”
