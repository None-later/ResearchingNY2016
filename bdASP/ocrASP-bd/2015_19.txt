The CDTA bus incident 
was not the only talk on the 
University at Albany campus 
last Tuesday.
March 1 marked Super 
Tuesday, the day where 
13 states and one territory 
voted for candidates of the 
Democratic and Republican 
parties for the 2016 presidential 
election.
“I had a feeling that Trump 
and Clinton would likely take 
majority of states/delegates,” 
UAlbany junior Molly O’Bryan 
said.
Business mogul-turned-
politician Donald Trump took 
the most states with seven 
wins in the Republican race, 
and former Secretary of State 

Hillary Clinton prevailed on 
the side of the Democrats with 
seven states.
Ph.D. student and teaching 
assistant Charmaine Willis 
agreed with O’Bryan.
 “I expected that Clinton 
would win most of the 
southern states and Sanders 
the more liberal states, such 
as Colorado and his home 
state of Vermont,” Willis said. 
“The results of the Republican 
primaries were also fairly 
consistent with what I expected: 
Cruz took Texas (as well as 
neighboring Oklahoma) and 
Trump won most of the other 
states.”  
Junior Tatiana Kobe is 
pleased with Clinton’s win.
“I am beyond happy 
Clinton took the lead for 

the Democrats,” Kobe said. 
She also expressed concern 
that Trump remains the lead 
candidate for the GOP.
Freshman Natasha Makowicz 
disagreed with Kobe, saying 
that if Clinton wins, she is 
fleeing the country.
Not only are students 
reacting to the primaries, but 
teachers, like political science 
professor Anne Hildreth, spoke 
on what she feels about the 
outcome.
“I am fascinated that exit 
polls continue to show late 
deciders are less likely to 
choose Trump,” Hildreth 
said. “On the Democratic side 
I remain surprised with the 
level of competition Sanders is 
supplying Clinton.”

Super Tuesday is a Tuesday during the presidential primary season 
in which the greatest number of states hold a caucus in one day. More 
delegates can be won on Super Tuesday than any other single day during the 
primary calendar. Super Tuesday is said to represent a candidate’s overall 
electability, which is why winning Super Tuesday is so important duriny primary 
season. Many past nominees have been Super Tuesday winners.

On March 3, the Great Danes for 
Israel, co-sponsored with the Community 
for Accuracy in Middle East Reporting 
in America (CAMERA), hosted speaker 
Simon Deng, who escaped from slavery 
in North Sudan.
“Wrong is wrong, no matter how small 
it is,” Simon Deng said.
Deng began by clarifying that, even 
before the United Nations acknowledged 
it, Sudan was two countries, North and 

South. Overall, Sudan was overtaken 
by radicals who attempted to impose 
religious views on the African tribes. It 
took years for the people of South Sudan 
to gain recognition as an independent 
state, and preserve their culture in the 
face of an invading force.
Deng was 9 years old when he was 
abducted from his home village by his 
own neighbor and forced into slavery as 
a “gift” to the man’s cousin. At the time, 
Deng didn’t understand the meaning 
of slavery. He was beaten, humiliated, 

and forced to do hard labor. He could 
not “even say a word because [he] was 
owned by another human being.” 
“For three and a half years, it was hell. 
I was not considered a human being.” 
We, as free citizens, cannot image 
how he felt. Slavery is still a serious 
issue, and as Deng spoke, we should be 
concerned about it.
Fortune smiled upon Deng when he 
was nearly 13 years old. He ran into

As the safety of the nation’s drinking 
water comes under scrutiny, the 
University at Albany is working to do its 
part in alleviating the short and long term 
effects of this public health crisis. 
The presence of lead in Flint, 
Michigan’s tap water made national 
headlines this year and on a more local 
level, the Environmental Protection 
Agency (EPA) has advised Hoosick Falls 
residents against drinking their tap water 
due to the discovery of perfluorooctanoic 
acids (PFOAs) in the public water supply. 
According to Lawrence Schell, the 
director of the Center for the Elimination 
of Minority Health Disparities (CEMHD) 
and an anthropology professor at 
UAlbany, the presence of these 
contaminants in the water are a result of 
neglect on both ends: the government and 
manufacturing companies.
“Old cities have infrastructure that 
has to be maintained… when cities do 
not have the money to keep these things 
up then human health suffers,” he said. 
“We have to prioritize our health and 
security, and spend what is necessary 
to see that we have clean water that is 
not contaminated with chemical or with 
organic matter.” 
To help those affected by the unsafe 
drinking water in Flint, UAlbany’s 
Association for Black Social Workers in 
conjunction with the School of Criminal 
Justice’s Graduate Student Association 
has hosted Flint Week. According 
to a press release, members from the 
Association for Black Social Workers 
spent the first week of March raffling

week-long event on March 7 with a free 
showing of “Blue Gold: World Water 
Wars” in Husted Hall. All proceeds from 
the raffles, bake sale and any donations 
received at the movie showing will be 
donated to the victims of Flint. 

The closest that the UAlbany 
community has come to contaminated 
water was the presence of 
trihalomethanes in the town of 
Bethlehem this past summer, according 
to Schell. His main area of interest 
is centered around the effects that 
contaminated water can have on 
developing children. 
“I’m an anthropologist studying 
what human beings do to themselves 
indirectly,” Schell said. “We build an 
environment for ourselves, we live in it 
and it changes us biologically.” 
His past research has focused on 
the adverse health effects of lead and 
polychlorinated biphenyl, PCBs, on the 
development of Akwesasne Mohawk 
Indians on the St. Lawrence River. 
The anthropologist found that lead can 
decelerate the rate of sexual maturation 
in females, while PCBs accelerate it. The 
main issue with these two contaminants 
is that once they are in the human body 
they are very hard to get rid of. 
Schell will participate in a public 
panel discussion at SUNY New Paltz 
on March 15 titled “Toxic Water: The 
Poisoning of Flint, MI” along with 
Emily Garner from Virginia Tech and 

Michael Mascarenhas from Rensselaer 
Polytechnic Institute. Schell will 
discuss the research he conducted with 
the late Alice Stark during the 1990s 
on the effects of lead on the infants of 
disadvantaged women in Albany County. 
He also plans to present to his audience 
the federally recognized effects that lead 

can have on short and long term health. 
“What happened in Flint is terrible 
because unsuspecting populations were 
exposed to a very dangerous toxicant 
with well-known properties of health 
risk. The people who were supposed to 
protect them didn’t,” Schell said.

STUDENT PROFILE

By JANIE FRANK
 
Teah Sisti was 12 when she gave a 
presentation to her class about what she 
wanted to do when she grew up. Sisti 
told her classmates she wanted to walk 
in New York City Fashion week.
“Everybody laughed in my face,” 
Sisti said. “They were like: you’re not 
pretty, your nose is too big, you don’t 
have the right proportions.”
Sisti, a junior at the University at 
Albany, laughs when she tells the story 
now, but back then she was hurt.
“I was completely laughed at,” she 
said.
Sisti used that as her motivation.
“I’m the type of person when 
something like that happens, I fight for 
it so much more than I ever would have. 
I was like screw them, I’m gonna do 
this,” she said.
She went to open calls over the 
course of five years before she landed 
her first big job.
The first gig Sisti was hired for was a 
job she found via Craigslist.
“Things were much different then,” 
she said. “You can’t do that anymore 
because today everything is very 
sexualized. It’s like ‘Looking for Feet 
Models’ and you’re like, ‘Are you 
though?’”
After a year of going to auditions and 
castings, Sisti got a real job at the age of 
17. She was hired to work as a model for 
the International Beauty Show (IBS) at 
the Jacob K. Javits Convention Center.
“It’s so true in any industry, you’re 
told no a million times,” she said.
She believes that she was told no so 
often because of her body.
“Nobody chose me because my 
proportions for the modeling industry 
are off,” she said. “I’m considered 
plus… Standard high fashion is 00 to 4 
and I’m an 8/10.”
Sisti recognized that there is a big 
difference between being a plus size 
in the modeling world and actually 
being plus sized. She noted that she is 
still under the average clothing size for 
women in the United States, which is 
12/14.
The IBS was Sisti’s first big break.

“I made 
connections,” she said. “A few 
photographers liked me, I started putting 
together a portfolio and that was kind of 
my foot in the door.”
A photographer from IBS who liked 
her suggested she go to an open call for 
Fashion Week. Sisti went. She was 18 
and a freshman at UAlbany.
The man in charge of casting 
told Sisti she had a European nose 
which made him love her look. She 
immediately remembered her classmates 
telling her that she couldn’t model 
because her nose was too big. He 
offered her a spot in the show.
“It was one of the best moments in 
my life,” she said. “For me, it was such 
an incredible moment and from there

   Freshman 
Celine 
Thompson 
disagreed 
with 
Hildreth about Sanders’ competition, and 
was disappointed at Sanders’ take of four 
out of 13 states.
“I honestly thought Sanders would have 
done better,” Thompson said. “Everyone 
seems to be rooting for him.”
Freshman Lorrie Lord agreed with 
Thompson, saying, “I was hoping that 
Sanders would be passing Clinton after the 
voting was finished but was disappointed 
when I found out that wasn’t the case.”
The lack of support for Sanders was not 
the only surprise. Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, 
took home three wins. Sen. Marco Rubio, 
R-Fl., earned his first win in Minnesota.
 “I was surprised to see Cruz win as 
many [states] as he did,” said O’Bryan.

Historically, Super Tuesday was a way 
to regulate who became the Democratic 
nominee.
“The original purpose of Super Tuesday, 
at least on the Democratic side, was to 
moderate the party’s nomination process 
with a Southern stamp,” said Hildreth.  “I 
think it worked that way on the Democratic 
side, but on the Republican side it was not 
kind to the more conservative candidates 
and favorite sons.”
As mixed as reactions are, most feel that 
results gave a good indication of who will 
be running in November.
Willis said, “The results of Super 
Tuesday seem to be a continuation of 
the trends and primaries of the previous 
caucuses and primaries. I expect that 
Clinton and Trump will be the names on 
the ballots in November, barring a drastic 
change.”

Although Sisti still models on her breaks, 
she’s hoping to work in fashion marketing 
as her career.

it was 
mayhem. 
Sisti didn’t 
live in the 
city at that 
time so she had to travel in and out for 
fittings. She ended up walking in Fashion 
Week for 12 different designers.
Because Fashion Week was held over 
a school break, she only had to miss one 
day of class. However, she does feel 
like being at UAlbany has hindered her 
modeling career.
“It definitely limits me. Modeling 
while being at a university in Albany is 
virtually impossible,” she said. “I don’t 
have a car so I’m very, very limited 
here.”
Sisti knew going into college that her 
decision could affect her career.
“I could have been signed to a few 
different agencies but nobody wanted 
to hear the fact that I was going away to 
school.”
She chose UAlbany anyway.
“I really wanted to be in Albany and 
have this experience,” she said. “I could 
put modeling on hold, I wanted to focus 
on my education.”
She hasn’t put modeling on hold 
entirely though. Instead, she makes sure 
to book jobs while she is home on breaks. 
She usually does trade shows. Over 

winter break Sisti worked as a model for 
Accessories The Show.
“You get paid and it’s fun but it’s not 
couture, it’s not high fashion, it’s not 
Fashion Week,” she said. “That’s what I 
really miss.”
Even though she still loves modeling, 
she has become disillusioned by it.
“It’s just a very high demand industry 
and it is hard,” she said. “You have to 
have thick skin.”
At 21, Sisti is considered by some in 
the industry to be old.
“They really start you when you’re 
13. They train girls from very young 
ages.”
At 5’10”, Sisti is on the shorter side 
for high fashion modeling. She said the 
requirements usually ask from someone 
who is a minimum of 5’10” and a 
maximum of 6’.
Sisti said models have to have the 
look that a certain company is looking 
for.
“High fashion is constantly changing 
and you either have what they’re looking 
for or you don’t,” she said. “It’s not as 
fun for me as it used to be. You really 
are a hanger and that’s why they want 
you so skinny.”
Although Sisti has never suffered 
from anorexia or bulimia, she has seen it 
first hand, especially in Fashion Week. 

She admitted that she could get carried 
away from counting calories as well.
Sisti said modeling is very personal 
because models are judged on how they 
look, but it can be very impersonal as 
well.
“They’re not taking pictures of your 
face or even your body. They want the 
piece, they want what you’re showing 
off,” she said.
In fact, a model, unless she is well 
known, will rarely hear her name.
“They call you sweetie a lot in the 
industry… because they don’t care to 
know your name. They don’t care at all,” 
she said.
Sisti is not sure she wants to be a 
model for her career. “I realized that I 
actually love marketing so I think my new 
goal is to do something more like that.”
She hopes to go into fashion marketing 
and would love to intern over the summer 
for a company like Victoria’s Secret.
While she may have changed directions 
for her career choice, Sisti still feels that 
modeling has taught her a lot.
“I really believe that if you persevere 
and you believe in yourself that you can 
accomplish anything,” she said. “When 
you do achieve what you set out for, it’s 
such a satisfied feeling… It’s beautiful 
and no one can take that away.”

of his owners 
attended high school in a more populated 
city. These two men connected him to 
someone from his village, who secreted 
him away from captivity and back to his 
home, where he reunited with his family. 
Deng learned that his father had offered 
10 cows, a substantial reward, for anyone 
who could provide information or help 
find his missing son. The family was 
overjoyed to be whole again once more.
The first thing Deng did when he 
returned home was to have his tribe’s 
markings placed upon his face. Deng 
recalled how his slave master would tell 
him that unless he gave up his identity 
as a member of an African tribe, and 
joined his master’s religion, Deng would 
continue to be less than human. Deng 
took the markings to give himself an 
identity, something he considers just as 

important, if not more so, than freedom.
Deng has spent much of his life since, 
traveling parts of the world and speaking 
to anyone who will listen, about the 
horrors he lived through, and the steps 
we need to take to fix these issues. He 
has organized Sudan Walks across the 
United States and in the Netherlands to 
build support for his people. He thanks 
and supports Israel, as the only country 
in the world that gives freedoms and 
rights to immigrants and refugees. Israel 
was the first country to recognize South 
Sudan as an independent country, and 
South Sudan remains allies with Israel.

F O L L O W  U S  O N  T W I T T E R :  @ A L B S T U D E N T P R E S S

D

espite being brought up in Ontario 
and living most of my life in 
the United States, I knew I was 
considered a foreigner. I never paid 
much attention to it because no one treated 
me differently. I’ve always had friends from 
all ethnicities and I felt safe in this country. I 
felt comfortable knowing that I could be who 
I am, even if it was different from others. 
While I read through Jeffrey Berman’s 
book “Death Education in the Writing 
Classroom,” I came across one of Kasia’s 
experiences. I was left speechless. 
Kasia spoke about 9/11. She wrote how 
she was cutting through the towers as she 
always had with her sister, Katia, to go to 
school. But on that day, they stepped out of 
the train into “chaos.” Everyone was running 
around, and the two sisters didn’t know why. 
They asked a lady what the mayhem was 
about and she said, “there’s a fire.” 
They were able to get out of the area 
safely amid the shrieking and running 
people. Some screamed, “Look, there’s 
another one. Look!” but they couldn’t see 
past the smoke in the towers. 
Eventually, they did. 
She saw arms and legs falling from the 
building. Looking away immediately, her 
eyes were already in tears. She said that 
if it weren’t for her calm and brave sister, 
she wouldn’t have known what to do. 

When the second plane hit the towers, the 
ground shook like an earthquake and Kasia 
thought that “[they’re] going to die.” Her 
sister stayed calm and got them out of that 
horrifying situation and after four hours, they 
were finally home. 
Kasia said that “[she] had always known 
that the world was a dangerous place, but 
[she] never felt that fear until 9/11. [She had] 
never felt such hatred until 9/11. And [she] 
had never truly understood the value of life 
until 9/11.” 
Just like Kasia, I never valued my “former 
world” until it changed. 
I can relate to the lesson that Kasia 
learned from this incident because I can 
relate to 9/11 because it shattered my world 
too. 
We have frequently heard the news in the 
last decade, and it has impacted all of us in 
different ways, but I’ve never met anyone 
who was actually there during that day. I 
can’t fathom the fear that one feels when 
he or she sees bodies falling from the sky. 
That’s unreal to me. 
My sister and I learned something similar 
on that day. My sister used to wear the hijab, 
which is simply a head scarf, until 9/11 
happened. Suddenly, she was reminded that 
she wasn’t an “American,” that she was 
still somehow a foreigner and mostly, that 
despite being a little girl, she was treated as 
if she was responsible. 
After the incident, students from her 

school started harassing her, calling her a 
“terrorist,” pulling on her scarf, and treating 
her like she wasn’t human. She was just a 
little girl. She used to come home crying 
every day and started making excuses not to 
go back to school. My parents noticed that 
she was going through trauma at school and 
told her to take her scarf off. 
Her life became “normal” again. She 
wasn’t mistreated anymore although she felt 
unsafe no matter how friendly people were 
with her. Since 9/11, my sister realized that 
it wasn’t safe for her.
Eleven years after 9/11, my sister and 
I decided to wear the hijab. She wasn’t 
hesitatant about the idea because her faith in 
her religion was stronger than the fear that 
was instilled in her. 
Kasia wrote that “[she’s] not sure what 
she lost on that day but even though [she] 
always knew that the world wasn’t a safe 
place, that day [she] found out that it was a 
malicious one.”
I’m a woman who holds Islamic beliefs 
but I’m not quite sure of what people see me 
as. I don’t feel like a foreigner. I was raised 
in the United States all my life so why would 
I? However, there is something in the back 
of my mind that reminds me that I might 
never be accepted for who I am and I feel 
like I always have something to prove. 
I’ve always heard in the news that there 
are evil people in the world and we should 
be aware of them. But I never imagined that 

a few people who destroyed the image of my 
religion in front of the whole world would 
leave millions of Muslims behind to answer 
for their deeds. 
I don’t blame her for feeling the way she 
does because of it since millions of people 
in the United States, as well as in other 
countries, feel the same way. I was always 
too afraid to think about the impact that 9/11 
had on me because I felt like I was somehow 
to blame. 
It’s probably because whoever did it 
claimed to be “Muslims.” 
I couldn’t talk about 9/11 because of 
guilt. I wanted to apologize to those who lost 
friends, relatives, and family members, as if 
I was to blame. 
I had to realize that people, like myself, 
follow a religion that does not promote chaos 
and violence whereas others out there use the 
word “Islam” in the worst ways possible. 
There are incidents in our lives that 
destroy who we are within moments, and it 
takes years to put those broken pieces back 
together. 
This world may or may not be 
“malicious,” but I do know and am grateful 
for the people who put their differences and 
personal experiences aside, and see people 
for who they are. I realized that even though 
religion is impactful, there aren’t such 
“people” as Christians, Jews, and Muslims, 
but that there’s really just good and bad. 
 

ISLAM DOES NOT EQUAL TERRORISM

RELIGION

Source: Wikipedia.org
The idea that Islam is associated with terrorism is still relevant today. People need to learn to dissovle the association between the two, as there is not necessarily a 
connection.

Last month three young women, 
Asha Burwell, 20, Ariel Agudio, 
20, and Alexis Briggs, 20, filed a 
police report claiming that they had 
been victims of a hate crime. They 
reported that they were beaten on 
a CDTA 11 bus due to the color of 
their skin. They claimed that racial 
slurs were thrown their way during 
the altercation and thus, they were 
forced to retaliate.
It was the fight heard around 
campus. The story made campus, 
local and national headlines, 
inciting rallies, tweets and letters 
addressed to President Robert 
J. Jones and the three students 
themselves. Just on campus, 
a #BlackLivesMatter and 
#BlackGirlsMatter rally was held 
in front of the Campus Center at the 
small fountain. 
The story has been an ongoing 

development since it was first 
reported. 
It has even garnered the attention 
of presidential candidate Hillary 
Clinton who tweeted, “There is no 
excuse for racism and violence on a 
college campus.”
Finally, the CDTA footage was 
revealed on several formats and 
with several angles, all showing the 
fight was not exactly as the three 
girls claimed it to be. 
The three girls were reported 
to have started the fight, throwing 
the first punch and being the 
aggressors. No racial slurs could be 
heard based on the videos released, 
and the incident appeared to be 
false.
According to a recent Times 
Union report, “All three were 
charged with misdemeanor assault, 
punishable by up to one year in 
jail.”

The New York Times followed 
up in more detail, reporting that 
“Ms. Burwell and Ms. Agudio, 
who publicized the episode through 
Twitter, also pleaded not guilty to 
charges of making a false report. 
The judge who oversaw the 
arraignment called the charges, if 
proved, ‘shameful.’”
A letter addressed to Jones found 
in an earlier issue of the Albany 
Student Press called for an apology 
to be issued.
UAlbany senior Jeffrey 
Rosenheck, in his letter, said, “I 
believe that you should send a 
personal apology to the UAlbany 
family. We cannot, and will not, 
be the victims of something that 
has plagued our nation. We must 
reserve judgment until all of the 
evidence is brought before us. You 
must lead the way. You must prove 
to us that due process does not have 
a skin color.”
The letter also addressed the 
hysteria that surrounded the campus 
and how quickly Jones and the 
rest of the student body were to 
criminalize the students who ended 
up being victims.
Personally, I did not want 
to jump on the bandwagon of 
ostracizing the 10 to 12 white 
students who were being blamed 

for a very heinous crime. 
I needed the facts. And now that 
the truth is coming to light, I have 
only cemented my belief that with 
a radical claim, facts and backup 
information are much needed. It 
was far too easy to assume that a 
hate crime was committed. 
And with that, I do not want the 
person reading this article to ever 
believe that I condone hate crimes 
or think that this issue simply 
needs to blow over. I appreciate 
how quickly this campus came 
together, over one weekend, 
planned and threw a successful 
rally with a massive turnout and 
tons of media coverage. There was 
an overwhelming sense of unity 
and strength in numbers. Every life 
matters, and we need to do more 
to reflect the fact that black lives 
matter too.
Unfortunately, UAlbany’s 
newest mascots of this movement 
on the local level turned out to be 
frauds. More importantly, by lying 
and being the aggressors, they have 
perpetuated the exact idea that they 
were trying to shy away from: They 
became the stereotypical aggressive 
black girls whom most people 
want nothing to do with. They 
made a mockery of the movement, 
hindering it rather than promoting 

it.
Kevin Fadairo, 19, a UAlbany 
sophomore and human biology 
major, said the incidents “make it 
seem like #BlackLivesMatter is a 
joke. [The girls] made it look like 
a joke.”
“I feel like they tricked us. What 
does it mean for us now?” he said.
I encourage the university and 
the entire student body to continue 
to stand together and support one 
another. 
“The vilification of these young 
women is quite disturbing and 
scary,” Agudio’s lawyer Mark 
Mishler said, according to The New 
York Times. 
I agree. 
These girls deserve what the 
law is giving to them, but they 
are not wrong to shed light on an 
issue that needs to bathe in the 
sun. The same goes for Jones. 
The man has only said what he 
knows to be the truth, he has never 
sided with any particular student, 
but has sided with the notion 
that racial discrimination and 
hate crimes should never, under 
any circumstance, occur on this 
campus.
We must keep this notion alive 
and let the liars lie.

L

et’s finally talk about the elephant in the 
room. It’s been about a month since the 
infamous “CDTA incident” has taken the 
University at Albany and surrounding community 
by storm.

ASSISTANT EDITOR: DANIEL PINZON
OPINIONS.ASP@GMAIL.COM

The fire alarm has gone 
off more than enough times, 
specifically on the freshmen 
quads, State and Indian. Although 
it may seem as though an actual 
fire is upon us, it might just be a 
bag of popcorn that was burning 
in the microwave. This bag 
of popcorn triggers the alarm, 
forcing residents to evacuate. 
The problem here can either 
be that freshmen are too reckless 
or the smoke alarms are too 
sensitive, or a combination of 
both. As a freshman, I’m aware 
that my fellow freshmen are not 
adjusted to a life of a fire alarm 
being right next them at all times. 

Every room in a suite has a fire 
alarm. And even though we can 
get away doing certain things in 
our homes, those loopholes don’t 
apply here. But with the surplus 
of fire alarms, not only does it 
maximize security against fires, 
it also increases chances of minor 
things setting off the alarm.
“I feel as though fire alarms are 
a double edge sword because we 
hate them, we hate leaving our 
buildings at 5 a.m. on a Tuesday, 
but we can’t live without them,” 
said Kayla Popuchet, a freshman 
at the UAlbany living on a 
freshman quad. “It sucks, but 
how can you really complain. . . 

I mean I think the student body 
needs to get their shit together.”
If anything, it’s pretty easy to 
not set off the alarm. If someone 
needs to smoke, they can smoke 
outside. The weather shouldn’t 
matter - smoke outside. If 
someone is using the microwave, 
they need to pay attention to it. 
If they know the substance being 
used burns easily, watch it. Don’t 
go into the world and forget about 
the thing in the microwave.
With these constant non-fires 
occurring, it’s going to reassure 
the students in the dorms that 
the next time the fire alarm 
rings, it doesn’t have to be taken 
seriously. But it should be taken 
seriously, not matter the fire 
alarms’ history. An actual fire did 
occur on Feb. 23 in Oneida Hall 
on Indian Quad. It was caused by 
an unattended candle, which we 
aren’t even suppose to have in the 
first place. These fake fires are 
making residents too comfortable 
when fire safety is extremely 

important.
It’s a running joke for freshmen 
that they cause too many fire 
alarms. So in turn, not only do 
freshmen not take fire alarms 
seriously, no one is going to 
take freshmen seriously. It may 
come to the point that whenever 
the fire department gets a call to 
tend to State or Indian Quad, they 
may not expect an actual danger 
present. They will still tend to 
the matter, but they won’t be 
surprised when no fire is present.
More so, these incessant fire 
alarms are simply annoying, 
especially for a person that lives 
in the tower. The tower has 21 
floors of residents. I used to live 
in Eastman tower, and residents 
can agree that having the fire 
alarm go off in the middle of the 
night isn’t the best thing in the 
world. I’ve even experienced two 
consecutive fire alarms, both in 
the middle in the night. It was 
clear that the residents of Eastman 
tower were not happy. It also 

wastes time to evacuate 21 floors 
of the tower.
And some people are 
convinced they can get away with 
doing things such as smoking 
inside. Even if you think covering 
the fire alarm with a plastic bag, 
blowing smoke straight out of 
the window, or fanning the air 
will not set off the alarm, there’s 
a strong chance it will make 
about one hundred people have to 
evacuate. That’s not fun. Moral 
of the story: be responsible living 
on campus, acknowledge that 
there are other people living in the 
same building. Don’t be reckless. 
Don’t set your microwave to 
30 minutes on an item that only 
takes two minutes. Be mindful of 
indoor activities. 
The fire alarm is there for our 
safety. So we might as well let it 
do its job and keep us safe, and 
let it go off only during an actual 
hazard. Eventually, we will learn 
to live with the fire alarm in 
peace.

F

rom kindergarten to elementary school, 
stop, drop and roll has been engraved into 
our heads, as if being caught on fire was 
so common. For those students who live on the 
quads at the University at Albany, that may be 
plausible, or so it may seem.

CAMPUS LIFE
UALBANY’S ANTHEM IS A FIRE ALARM

By DANIEL PINZON

By KEVIN FUREY

Traditionally, freshmen at 
the University at Albany were 
housed on Indian and State 
Quads while sophomores who 
were admitted as freshmen 
were housed on Colonial and 
Dutch Quads. Transfers and 
International students were 
housed on Alumni while juniors 
and seniors had the option to live 
in university apartments or to 
move off-campus. 
However, ResLife is bringing 
some changes to the current 
housing requirements.
From now on, freshmen 
entering their second year at the 
UAlbany will be given priority 
registration for Colonial and 
Dutch quads and it’s only after 
all returning freshmen sign up 
for housing that Colonial and 
Dutch will be open for juniors 
and seniors to sign up. The 
university will also be allowing 
some sophomores to live on 
Alumni and several others to live 
in university apartments. 
Overall, what the university 
is trying to accomplish is to get 
more juniors and seniors to live 
off-campus so there is more 
availability on-campus for new 
students. 
As often is the case, freshmen 
dorms are overcrowded. Many 
rooms are forced triples, while 
some lounges are converted into 
living space. This can result in 
low retention rates for freshmen.
That’s why pushing more 
juniors and seniors off-campus 
is a good idea, but only if the 
university starts to take some 
leadership on the off-campus 
housing situation. 
Take a walk through the area 
where most students get their off-
campus houses, Pine Hills, and 
you will notice that some houses 
are in such dire need of repair 
that they are literally slouching. 

It goes further than that.
When my suitemates and I first 
started looking into houses off-
campus for next year, we noticed 
a few unsettling things. 
To start, most of the leases 
contained hidden fees, which 
can equal a costly bill once the 
leasing term is over. One such 
lease we looked at had a $300 
fine if the tenant forgot to clean 
underneath the refrigerator when 
they vacate the property. 
Other leases disclosed that 
the tenants were responsible if 
anything happened to the house, 
meaning that if the slouchy house 
collapsed the first day that the 
tenants moved in, they would be 
held liable. 
However, the worst was 
when we toured an apartment on 
Hamilton Street and saw that the 
landlord had allowed nearly 15 
people to live there, in a three-
bedroom apartment. 
UAlbany currently has an 
Office of Neighborhood Life that 
handles problems that residents 
have with their landlords. 
However, if the university wants 
to push more students into off-
campus houses, Neighborhood 
Life needs to be drastically 
expanded. 
My suitemates and I were able 
to find a perfect house with a 
perfect lease, but not all students 
are as keen about reading leases. 
Many students will learn the 
hard way that the lease they 
signed contains hidden fees and 
leaves the tenants subject to 
responsibilities that should be the 
landlords’. 
If UAlbany wants more 
students to move off-campus, 
perhaps they could create a 
registry where they keep track 
of all landlords, and their leases, 
that rent to students. That way 
less students sign leases with 
slum landlords who scam them 
out of money.

When did being a feminist 
and believing in female 
empowerment become more 
about advocating and justifying 
being a hoe?
In our day and age, being a 
hoe has become some sort of 
cool trend that females want 
to partake in. It has become 
normalized. Feminism is 
supposed to be the advocacy 
of women’s rights on the 
grounds of political, social and 
economic equality to men, but 
somehow it’s become a term 
to mask being a hoe without 
being called out about it.
NBA’s MVP Stephen 
Curry’s wife, Ayesha, got heat 
for a tweet she sent out a few 
months ago where she told her 
followers what she prefers to 
do with her body. 
“Just looking at the latest 
fashion trends. I’ll take classy 
over trendy any day of the 
week,” Curry said. “Everyone’s 
into barely wearing clothes 
these days huh? Not my style. 
I like to keep the good stuff 
covered up for the one who 
matters.”
That tweet sent Twitter into 
a firestorm. Some women on 
Twitter thought Curry was 
looking down on women that 
like to dress provocatively by 
somehow correlating “being 
classy” with the clothes you 

choose to wear. But you could 
not be more wrong. With 
this being a touchy subject, 
Curry was not suggesting you 
wear floor length skirts with 
turtlenecks everyday. What 
she was doing was voicing her 
opinion. The backlash she got 
was asinine and ridiculous. 
There was absolutely 
nothing wrong with what Curry 
said. Her choosing to dress 
“modestly” doesn’t mean she’s 
shaming other women. Your 
body is supposed to be your 
temple. That meaning, leave 
some to the imagination. You 
don’t have to be provocative in 
order to be or feel sexy. It’s not 
supposed to be something that 
you share with the entire world. 
With that being said, there 
is nothing wrong with wearing 
whatever makes you feel 
sexy or doing whatever you 
like as an adult, but to take 
the meaning of feminism 
and misconstrue it to fit your 
narrative is just wrong. 
There was an article in the 
Albany Student Press on Jan. 
26, 2016 by Daniel Pinzon, 
where he wrote that Cardi B. 
has had an impact on female 
empowerment. Cardi B. is a 
stripper who became famous 
on Instagram and is currently 
on “Love and Hip Hop New 
York” on VH1. 
“Cardi B. breaks the 
constraint on women and 

embraces harmful words 
such as ‘hoe,’ ‘thot’ and 
‘slut.’ She owns up to it, and 
acknowledges that being overly 
sexual is not abnormal for 
women,” Pinzon wrote.
While she’s taking those 
words away and not giving 
men (or other women for 
that matter) the power to 
degrade her with them, it’s not 
“empowering.” What you do 
in your personal life is your 
prerogative, but to sit there and 
call yourself a “hoe” is actually 
demeaning.
One of Cardi B.’s costars 
on the show, MariahLynn, has 
a song where the first couple 
lyrics are “once upon a time, 
not long ago, I was a hoe and 
I’m admitting it.” While the 
song is catchy, when did this 
become empowering?
This is not a judgment to 
these women at all, but it’s not 
empowering. I don’t believe 
that being a stripper or overly 
sexually active is something 
to be frowned upon, but it also 
doesn’t mean you’re a feminist, 
empowering or driving the 
feminism movement forward. 
It seems that millennial 
feminists want to partake in 
“hoe-like” activities without 
being labelled with the term. 
Somehow this has become 
the standard and something to 
look up to and that has to be 
changed.

The University at Albany Department of Music and 
Theatre’s spring production, “Bloody Bloody Andrew 
Jackson,” wanted to be both educational and offensive. It 
managed to accomplish both.
The satirical emo-rock musical, directed by UAlbany 
student Chad Larabee, began showing at the Performing 
Arts Center on Wednesday, March 2. The play introduced 
itself by saying they wanted to make sure that every group 
present would be a little offended by the end, including 
Celine Dion. 
Originally written and directed by Alex Timbers, the 
musical recounts Andrew Jackson’s rise to presidency, 
the creation of the Democratic Party, hardships he faced 
including the death of his wife, Rachel, and relocating the 
Native Americans through the Indian Removal Act.
Despite the heavy subjects, the show takes a light 
approach when conveying these times. Who wouldn’t want 
to see a closeted homosexual Martin van Buren, a bloody 
date and the narrator getting shot in the neck?
Nevertheless, at its core, the show intended to show 
UAlbany students that despite the political agenda 
being far different in the 1800s, similar characteristics 
still currently face the United States and its most recent 
presidents.
During Jackson’s presidency, he was forced to make 
a decision regarding an isolated and ostracized group 
of people. The show wanted to address groups today in 
similar distress. During one of the final scenes, images 
of Islamophobia protests, #BlackLivesMatter rallies, and 

LGBT protests were projected onto the back wall.
Despite doubling the size of the United States with the 
Louisiana Purchase, Jackson’s reign was tarnished because 
of the Trail of Tears, the forceful removal of Native 
American nations from United States territories following 
the Indian Removal Act of 1830. The relocation led to the 
suffering and deaths of thousands of Native Americans.
“I’m really proud of our cast,” said Larabee. “We 
wanted to produce [the musical] because of the presidential 
primaries. This show is so timely. We’re hoping audiences 
will be more involved in the presidential process.”
Larabee hopes that this show has moved students to go 
find the polls and cast their votes to make a difference in 
the upcoming presidential election. He was smart enough 
to do that through emo rock solos.
“Andrew Jackson” himself, mental health counseling 
graduate student Alec Lewis, 23, gave the presidential role 
a modern spin, donning tight pants, a musket, and lots of 
blood. Bloodletting is a metaphor for illness, according to 
the lyrics by Michael Friedman. 
This version of Jackson is all about his greatest 
achievement: equality.
“It’s kind of ironic that my last line in the play is ‘I 
hope you remember me as a man whose achievement 
was for everyone in this country: equality’ because the 
entire play is about him killing all these people who live 
in America,” said Lewis. “[His achievement] absolutely 
wasn’t [equality.]”
Computer science major Devin Chacho, 18, who 
plays John Quincy Adams, said that looking back at 
what’s happened throughout in the light of the message 

perpetuated by the UAlbany theatre program, it is best to 
try and avoid the mistakes of the past.
The production was unapologetic in showcasing a 
“lighthearted” massacre of pretty much everyone on stage, 
much like the initial narrator of the musical. The show 
even ends with one of the actors, Serena Zajac, getting 
shot by an arrow and lying dead on the stage floor until the 
audience left.
“I had a lot of fun,” said Zajac. “Some people were 
concerned with me dying on stage, but I’m fine.”
The show also has several fourth wall breaks including 
conversing with the narrator, the audience and the band 
that were hidden in the back corner of the stage. The songs 
were filled with comedic light, even with heavy context at 
times.
Katherine Kulikowski’s rendition of “Ten Little 
Indians” was both haunting and comedic, casually killing 
off ten “Indians” as she sang. The show also categorized 
several former presidents into fun archetypes. Chacho’s 
John Quincy Adams was awkward and in his father’s 
shadow, Sean Dolnick’s Martin Van Buren was humorous 
in his closeted homosexual activities, like sensually eating 
a Twinkie.
It was a production that called for no expectations, but it 
did deliver. 
“It was such a fun experience,” said Alexei Candreva, 
who played Lyncoya Jackson. “I would do it again in a 
heartbeat.”
After the performance, theatre department marketing 
supervisor Kahlia Taylor said that “it’s like watching your 
babies grow up.”

By DIEGO CAGARA

The Easter Bunny may bring colorful 
eggs to children but a different kind of bunny 
appears in Disney’s “Zootopia” - and this 
one strives to not be solely seen as cute or 
innocent. 
Since she was growing up in 
Bunnyburrow, Judy Hopps (Ginnifer 
Goodwin) has dreamed of becoming a cop, 
something her carrot-farmer parents found 
problematic since rabbits are believed to not 
be capable of such a physically demanding 
career. However, her determination and 
passion for achieving her dream career, along 
with her intelligence, help keep this fur-filled 
animated film hopping. 
In a world where civilized and 
anthropomorphic animals live in harmony 
regardless of whether they are prey or 
predator, they dress, talk, work, act and 
even park their cars like we humans do. The 
film focuses on Hopps becoming a cop in 
Zootopia, an animal-heavy metropolis akin 
to New York City. It is split into numerous 
districts like Tundratown, Rainforest District 
and Sahara Square, where different species 
get to live in their natural habitats, like in the 
real world, but still coexist peacefully—for 
the most part. Hopps is initially awestruck 
and excited about working at Zootopia 
but immediately realizes that her peers, 

especially her boss, Chief Bogo (Idris Elba), 
also believe that she, a small rabbit, does not 
belong there. 
The film often contains funny puns 
throughout such as when Chief Bogo 
addresses “the elephant in the room,” only 
for the audience to see the police wishing an 
actual elephant policeman a surprise happy 
birthday. Stores and products in Zootopia 
like DNKY (parodying DKNY), a Carrot 
smartphone (Apple), Preyda (Prada) and 
Hoof Locker (Foot Locker) help provide a 
background comedic effect and add to the 
overall metropolitan feel. 
The film does turn somewhat dark and 
serious sometimes as Hopps, fed up with 
just ticketing parking offenders, is tasked 
with finding a missing otter with Nicholas 
Wilde (Jason Bateman), a sly red fox and con 
artist with whom she initially clashes. Their 
adventure to locate the otter inadvertently 
leads them to discover numerous other caged 
animals who had been recently reported 
missing, all of which now behave erratically 
and “uncivilized.”
They realize that there is a mastermind 
plot behind these missing animals: to make 
all predator animals be seen as “savage,” 
hence dividing Zootopia and make prey 
animals believe they are dangerous and 
thus marginalize the predators. During a 
press conference, Hopps, under pressure, 

incorrectly assumes that the “savage” animals 
have deteriorated to their primitive ways. 
This severs her friendship with Wilde who 
feels offended and also divides Zootopia 
as prey animals distance themselves from 
predator animals and the film neatly links 
this to racism. There is a heartbreaking scene 
where a mother rabbit moved her child away 
from a nearby tiger on a train.
“Zootopia” provides great social 
commentary and teaches poignant life 
lessons about fighting ignorance, racism 
and inequality as well as the importance 
of persistence and proving one’s worth 
despite being bullied or frowned upon. Such 
messages may have become repetitive in 
contemporary culture but the injection of 
anthropomorphic animals makes it feel new 
again, showing viewers just how critical 
these issues are. While filled with hysterical 
one-liners and crime-based adventure, how 
it tackled racism and prejudice brilliantly 
champions the idea of inclusivity.
Goodwin’s voice emits optimism and 
positivity as Hopps while Bateman’s 
successfully projects the slick con fox’s 
rhetoric. Colombian singer Shakira 
portrays pop star Gazelle and her song “Try 
Everything” continues to spread the overall 
sanguine theme throughout the film. 
Zootopia, with all its districts, looks 
like an interactive theme park and the 

animation looks iridescent and effervescent to 
complement the many species that grace the 
screen, enriching its Pixar-level storytelling. 
As Zootopia’s inclusive amenities 
accommodate all from tall giraffes to small 
lemmings, the city itself is just an astonishing 
sight.
“Zootopia” is a refreshingly original film 
since recent animated films like Pixar’s 
“The Good Dinosaur” and 20th Century 
Fox’s “Home” have not received as much 
acclaim as past ones, with the sole exception 
of “Inside Out,” making critics wonder 
if animated movies have become stale or 
dependent on sequels. But the emotional 
and inclusive themes in “Zootopia” are 
entertaining yet revitalizing.

To conclude Black History month, the 
University at Albany hosted the Grammy 
award-winning musical ensemble, Sounds 
of Blackness, at Page Hall at the Downtown 
Campus on Saturday, Feb. 27. Despite 
the winter blues and cold weather, the 
auditorium was filled by warmth and 
energy with inviting music that ranged from 
African songs to gospels to spirituals to 
rhythm and blues.
“This is the Sounds of Blackness 
first performance here in Albany at the 
university under President, former Sounds 
of Blackness member, Dr. Robert Jones. 
We’re so proud of him and we are just 
so honored to be here. This audience was 
amazing; everything from their energy to 
their sing-along, their spirit, and we can’t 
wait to come back,” said Gary Hines, the 
director of Sounds of Blackness. Hines 
wore a royal West African, Nigerian and 
Ghanaian cloth - a binding tie between us 
connecting the continents ancestrally and 
spiritually.
The group was formed at Gary Hines’ 
alma mater, Macalester College, where the 
ensemble began.
“We always have that academic 
connection. When they brought me on as 
director, really the vision that God gave me 

was to continue the tradition like Quincy 
Jones and Duke Ellington and when you 
hear those names you think of jazz, blues 
and we should. They would say, ‘I do the 
music of my people,’” Hines said.
“The music is in all of us, sounds of 
blackness, the black music that we sing, 
all genres of black music bring that out in 
the people we perform it for. That’s what 
makes it all worth it, it’s healing music, it’s 
inspiring music, it’s honoring as you have 
experienced tonight,” said Sherice Jones, 
one of the singers for Sounds of Blackness.
Jones surprised the audience and joined 
in on the last two song numbers with 
Sounds of Blackness, his former group of 
which he was once a member.
“We were hoping he would and when he 
went up there, that just made the evening, 
it was just tremendous definitely,” said 
Roberto Vives, director of the track and 
field and cross country programs. “This was 
an excellent performance.”
“Once a Sounds member, always a 
Sounds member and you just never know 
when you’ll be called up on stage to 
perform,” Sherice Jones said.
“I told them I wasn’t gonna dig tonight 
but Lorissa came and insisted, then I got 
caught in the moment. I’m glad I did, it was 
for my soul, I enjoyed it, I miss these folks 
a lot,” said Jones. “That represented 30 
years of my life, singing.”

As the winter season begins to end, movie 
lovers everywhere gathered for the award 
show they cared about the most: the Oscars. 
On Sunday, Feb. 28, the 88th Academy 
Awards were hosted at the Dolby Theatre in 
downtown Los Angeles, as the world of film 
came together for one night to celebrate the 
best in the business. 
The show kicked off with a monologue 
by host Chris Rock, who wasted no 
opportunities to fit in an “#OscarsSoWhite” 
joke. The monologue went over well, and it 
seemed as if Chris Rock’s performance was 
well-received.
When the awards started rolling out, it 
was clear that the Academy was mad for 
a certain film. “Mad Max: Fury Road,” 
won six out of the first seven awards in 
which it was nominated, winning almost 
every award in the technical categories of 
the show. “Mad Max” would go on to win 
no more awards for the night, losing in the 
major categories of Best Picture and Best 
Director. Despite not winning these awards, 
“Mad Max” was the biggest hit of the night, 
winning the most awards and a surprising 
six out of their 10 nominations.
One of the biggest surprises of the night 
came during the presentation of the Best 
Visual Effects Award, with low-budget 
sci-fi thriller “Ex Machina” winning the 
award. This category almost always goes 
to a blockbuster film with a budget in the 
hundreds of millions, this year facing up 
against “Star Wars: The Force Awakens,” 
“Mad Max,” “The Revenant,” and “The 

Martian.” All of these films have budgets at 
least 10 times that of “Ex Machina,” which 
was only created with a mere $15 million. 
In fact, it’s the lowest budgeted movie to 
be nominated for Best Visual Effects since 
“Alien” in 1979, budgeted at $11 million, 
without even taking inflation into the mix. 
Relatively early in the show, the awards 
in the supporting acting categories went to 
Mark Rylance for “Bridge of Spies,” and 
Alicia Vikander for “The Danish Girl.” As 
the show started to move to its close, the 
big awards for acting in a leading role were 
finally unveiled. 
Brie Larson took home the award for 
Best Actress for her role in the indie drama 
“Room,” while Leonardo DiCaprio finally 
took home his long-awaited Oscar for his 
role in the revenge thriller, “The Revenant.” 
He finally took home the gold as this was 
his fifth nomination, receiving a standing 
ovation from the crowd, and giving an 
acceptance speech that could probably win 
him another Oscar in the process. “The 
Revenant” also stole the award of Best 
Director, going to the acclaimed Alejandro 
González Iñárritu.
With the biggest award of the night left 
to go, “Spotlight” took home the award for 
Best Picture. Focusing on the uncovering of 
the Catholic Church sexual assault scandal 
by the Spotlight team at The Boston Globe, 
the film was critically lauded and considered 
to be a frontrunner for the award for Best 
Picture when it was released. This award 
ended the night, as most of the celebrity 
attendees made their way to after parties, 
basking in the joy of the greatest night in the 
world of film: the night of the Oscars.

FILM
Another year, another Oscars

By ELI ENIS

They waded through the dense crowd 
of chattering twenty-somethings, stepped 
up onto the stage, and picked up their 
respective instruments.
From that description, this could be 
any of the thousands of bands that played 
in front of a live audience on the evening 
of March 2. In actuality, PWR BTTM 
(pronounced Power Bottom), who took the 
stage last Wednesday at The Hollow, are 
unlike any other band and by the end of the 
set. Everyone in that room could’ve told you 
why. 
Ben Hopkins, who uses the pronouns 
they/them/their, was clad in a tight red dress, 
tube socks with multi-colored frogs on it, 
black tights, and black Doc Marten boots. 
Their face had a streak of glitter painted 
down their upper right jawline and purple 
glitter lipstick on their lips. Liv Bruce, who 
also uses they/them/their, was wearing 
light blue overalls, a pink sports bra, and 
a subtler red lipstick than their bandmate. 
They both had stylistically untamed mops 
of hair, although Liv’s was partially dyed 
blonde. Despite being just a two-piece, 
they commanded the stage, switching 
instrumental roles mid-set and providing 
some hilarious banter that often referenced 
their queerness. 
But it’s not just that they’re queer that 
makes them unique. It’s that they’re so 
openly proud of it in a manner that’s 
incredibly refreshing, empowering and 
admirable. It’s their unbridled willingness 
to be true to themselves and stand for what 
they believe in a genre that always has, 
and continues to be dominated by straight 
and cisgender males. In a genre where the 
concept of “music with a message” has 
become trite, PWR BTTM found a way to 
not only avoid stereotypes, but to smash 
them. 
After their set, Hopkins and Bruce sat 
down in the venue’s backstage area to talk 
about how being queer affects the band, 
their fan base, and to reflect on their career 
since releasing their debut album “Ugly 
Cherries” last fall. 
ASP: Obviously your queer image and 
culture is very important to the essence of 
the band. But would you guys prefer to be 
called a “queer punk band” or a “punk 
band who also happen to be queer?” How 
important is that distinction to you?
Hopkins: My kneejerk reaction is to say 
both. Being a queer punk band denotes this 
idea of being fetishized. Like “oh they’re 
queer punks.” Some people see it as being 
lesser than. I actually take that as a badge of 
pride. Often in our society, it’s hip, in a way, 
to be queer but it doesn’t feel glamorous. I 
started calling myself a queer punk ’cause it 
was scary to me to embrace that as a public 
image.
Bruce: There are queer artists who don’t 
label their music that way, and that’s totally 
fine, that’s their right to do. The reason we 
were interested in doing it is ’cause it comes 
through in the music whether we affix that 
label or not. And just by putting it there it 
stabs away the thing where people are afraid 
to say it. If we say it, then no one’s gonna 
feel uncomfortable calling us that, ’cause we 
call us that.
ASP: You guys recently announced 
that you have a request on your tour 
rider for gender-neutral bathrooms to 
be made easily accessible for fans at each 
venue you play. How’s that been going 
since implemented?  
Bruce: It’s been really exciting to do so 
far and a lot of our fans have been really 
grateful to us for it. Not every venue can 
do it and when a venue can’t do it it’s 
complicated. We don’t want to make it seem 
like we should be like “fuck these venues 
even though we’re playing here.” There’s 

some venues that can’t do it because of laws 
and local ordinances. That’s the only place 
where we run into trouble.
ASP: What’s been your most 
rewarding experience that came as a 
result of being in PWR BTTM?
Hopkins: I wasn’t openly queer before 
PWR BTTM. It actually pushed me to come 
out of the closet and have queer experiences. 
The summer before we were gonna do the 
band I was like, “I’m sick of thinking about 
this every day, I’m just gonna do it.” So 
I downloaded Grindr and started fucking 
boys.
Bruce: It’s been a really exciting way to 
connect with other queers, to travel around 
the country and meet queer people. I never 
had a lot of queer friends in New York and 
Boston, where I’m from. It’s a whole other 
thing to go to Eugene, Oregon and meet a 
boatload of queers.
ASP: Is there a message or thought 
that you want straight, cis males, 
specifically, to take from your music or 
live shows?
Bruce: Straight cis males are the last 
people on my mind when I write my 
music. I don’t think about them when I’m 
writing it. I’m writing for myself. But it 
is sometimes exciting when I’m writing a 
song and then I think of a line I can imagine 
someone identifying with. Those people that 
I imagine usually aren’t straight, cis males. 
If there’s anything that I want [them] to get 
from PWR BTTM’s music is that we’re 
not writing for them, but that’s okay and 
they’re still welcome at our shows if they’re 
respectful to people.
Hopkins: I don’t think we write songs for 
queer people. I think we do, but I don’t think 
we write songs for just them. I think that 
would be a really shitty way to make art.
ASP: You guys released “Ugly 
Cherries” last fall. How do you feel about 
the record now after having months to let 
it soak in? Anything you’d change?
Hopkins: It feels old. Actually it doesn’t 
feel old, it feels right. It feels like a perfect 
chronicle of that period of time. I actually 
listened to it the other day and was like “oh 
this feels far away from how I’m feeling 
right now,” which is good because it feels 
like we have something to say with this new 
record we’re working on.
ASP: It seems like PWR BTTM has 
been getting a lot of media attention over 
the past few months in particular. How 
do you guys feel about the majority of the 
articles that’ve been written about you? 
Are the writers generally channeling 
your thoughts well or is there something 
that’s getting lost in translation? Is there 
something you want to say that’s not 
getting said?
Hopkins: A good interviewer feels like 
a collaborator. A lot of people helped 
us understand our band more through 
interviews.
Bruce: It’s really fun when we get asked 
questions that make us think about our work 
in a way we haven’t yet. You never really 
know beforehand who’s gonna give you one 
of those magic interviews. It’s kind of fun. 
It’s like playing the lottery.
ASP: Tonight marks the beginning a 
fairly lengthy run with Sun Club and Ra 
Ra Riot. Both of those bands are pretty 
different than the bands you guys usually 
play with so what are you looking to 
accomplish on this tour? 
Hopkins: Just to be visible. To show that 
our audience is no different than anyone 
else’s audience.
Bruce: To be very openly and resolutely 
ourselves in front of crowds that are not the 
same as crowds we always play in front of. 
Give PWR BTTM shows to people who 
don’t know they’re PWR BTTM fans yet.

HEALTH

By MILO VOTAVA
 
Last week was National Eating 
Disorder Awareness Week, but many 
people were unaware of that even 
though a 2006 survey by the National 
Eating Disorders Association revealed 
that 20 percent of all college students 
have or have had an eating disorder 
at one point. That means one in every 
five students has or has had an eating 
disorder.
Why is there such a high number of 
college students with eating disorders? 
Being constantly surrounded by people 
makes it difficult to not compare one’s 
body to everyone else’s, even though 
comparing bodies can be damaging. It is 
difficult for those with eating disorders 
not to see themselves as inferior to 
those around 
them.
Another 
factor that 
might cause 
the high rates 
of eating 
disorders in 
colleges is 
the sudden 
removal of 
a family 
setting. For 
most students, 
college is the 
first time that 
they are living 
away from 
their families. 
Families 
generally act 
as support 
groups for 
students, and 
can help them 
through tough times. When students 
are suddenly on their own with no one 
reminding them to come eat dinner, it 
can be a lot harder to keep a schedule of 
structured eating.  
The types of meal plans that colleges 
offer can also affect people. Faced 
with an open buffet-style dining hall, 
some people will find it hard to stop 
themselves from binging, and others 
will eat nothing but the fresh fruit 
and yogurt that is provided round the 
clock, which eventually will lead to 
malnutrition and unhealthy weight loss.  
Others, in the face of such an 
abundance of food, will shy away 
from it instead. Drew Anderson, a 
psychology professor at the University 
at Albany and head of the Weight 
and Eating Disorders lab wrote many 
articles on the thought processes behind 
food avoidance, noting that mindful 
eating can be harder when one is 
presented with many options, and that 

mindful behavior leads to healthier 
eating habits. Dining halls are effective 
in feeding many students at once, but 
those with eating disorders might find it 
harmful to their mental health.
Something that’s also worth noting 
is that many eating behaviors and diet 
tips that are passed around in college 
are incredibly unhealthy, yet many 
students follow them, thinking that they 
will be fine since so many others do it. 
A sophomore biology major ate nothing 
but salads for her freshman year, noting 
that she lost about 50 pounds, but was 
unaware of the health problems such a 
restricted diet would cause in the long 
run, such as malnutrition, fatigue, and 
anemia. 
If you notice a friend trying out a 
potentially unhealthy diet or avoiding 
the dining 
hall at 
all costs, 
talking to 
them about 
it can help. 
People 
with eating 
disorders 
often 
know that 
what they 
are doing 
is unsafe, 
and do 
not know 
how to 
stop. It’s 
important 
that 
everyone 
gets to 
enjoy their 
time at 
college, 
and eating disorders are serious 
problems that can take up all the time 
and energy of those they affect.

ATHLETE’S CORNER

By BENNETT DRAKE 

JUNIOR ATTACKMAN BENNETT DRAKE 
COMMENTS ON  CORNELL WEEK FOR THE 
MEN’S LACROSSE TEAM. 

Cornell week did not disappoint. After playing them 
twice last year, the energy was far from forced, we 
couldn’t wait to revisit a team we beat down last spring. 
All week, the word “team” was ingrained in our 
minds, we knew that this year especially we had to 
focus on our collective effort to win games. When we 
came out onto John Fallon Field Saturday we knew 
that Cornell was coming to Albany hungry and ready 
for revenge, however that didn’t scare us-- Coach Marr 
had prepared us all week for the opening minutes of the 
game. 
We won the first face-off against a perennially great 

face-off specialist and were able to score on that very 
possession on an absolute bomb of a shot from Seth 
Oaks. That momentum seemed like all we needed to get 
us going all game. From there, we continued to ball and 
make plays all over the field. Blaze had an incredible 
performance, making 18 saves, yeah that’s a lot of saves. 
Connor Fields anchored the offense with four goals, 
yeah that’s a lot of goals.
What a lot of people don’t know is that although 
this game meant a lot in terms of a re-match from the 
NCAA tournament, it also hit a few family chords 
within our own team. Starting back in the day with 
Brian Lasda, father of our very own midfielder, Eli 
Lasda (#41), played for Cornell and won the 1976 
national championship. Brother of Ky Tarbell (#42), 
Kason Tarbell plays for the Big Red currently, and 
John Maloney’s (#0) little brother Ryan Maloney is 
committed to join the Big Red next season. Needless to 

say, winning this game means a few of our guys can sit 
with their chests puffed up at the next family dinner.
The team as a whole showed up Saturday to get 
this win. It will be that kind of effort that we need on 
Tuesday as we head to Umass-Amherst for our yearly 
showdown with the Minutemen.

By MICHAEL TURAY

On Saturday two familiar 
teams faced off at John Fallon 
Field, as No. 15 University at 
Albany Lacrosse (2-1) hosted 
Cornell (1-2) in a rematch of last 
year’s first round matchup of the 
NCAA Tournament. 
The last time they faced off, 
senior goalkeeper Blaze Riorden 
scored on an amazing ESPN top 
10 play, taking the ball coast-
to-coast and stunning Cornell’s 
defense. This time around 
the Pre-season All American 
recorded 18 saves and led the 
Great Danes to a 12-8 victory 
over the Big Red.
Riorden also had help from 
a spread offensive attack. Six 
UAlbany players scored includ-
ing sophomore attack Connor 
Fields who had four goals and 
two assists, and junior attack 
Seth Oakes, reigning America 
East player of the week, who 
added a hat trick. 
Oakes put UAlbany on the 
board first scoring the first of his 
three goals less than a minute 
into the contest, off a great look 
from Fields. A few minutes 
later, Senior midfield John 
Maloney found freshman middie 
Jack Burgmaster who scored off 
a long distance shot for his first 
career goal. Cornell replied with 
a goal, however UAlbany closed 

out the first period 2-1.
In the second period, the 
Great Danes continued to play 
an aggressive offensive and 
sophomore attack Justin Reh 
contributed. Reh scored three 
minutes into the second off a 
pass from Fields and less than 
a minute later Reh returned 
the favor setting up Fields for 
a textbook UAlbany  4-1 lead. 
These two, along with fellow 
attackman Oakes have shown 
effortless chemistry already this 
season.
Just when it looked as if 
UAlbany was getting ready to 
run away with this one, Cornell 
scored back-to-back goals to 
trim the margin to one goal. One 
goal didn’t seem to threaten the 
Great Danes because minutes 
later Oakes had an impressive 
no look over the shoulder pass 
to junior Eli Lasda for a goal. 
Oakes also added another one to 
his stat sheet and after another 
Cornell goal, Fields split a dou-
ble-team Cornell defense and 
added another one for himself, 
giving Albany the last laugh to 
end the half.
At halftime it was UAlbany 
leading 7-4. 
The second half mirrored the 
first; with Fields scored two 
goals to start the third period, 
pushing UAlbany’s led to 9-4. 
However, Cornell responded 

with three consecutive goals 
trimming the lead once again, 
this time to two. 
Junior midfielder Adam 
Osika responded this time. With 
2:17 remaining in the period, 
Osika added another UAlbany 
point to the board. The Great 
Danes defense remained stout, 
Reh forced a turnover and 
Riorden made a buzzer beating 
save as time expired in the third. 
UAlbany clung to a 10-7 lead 
after three. 
Riorden continued his de-
fensive prowess in the fourth 
quarter stopping four Cornell 
shots at goal in the opening 
3:15. The aggressive Cornell 
squad connected with 10:27 left 
in the game, making it 10-8. But 
a transition dunk by Reh and a 
dagger shot by Oakes put the 
game away. Albany took the 
contest 12-8. 
Oakes extended his goal 
streak to 20 games in a row. 
He has netted a goal in every 
contest he has suited up for the 
Great Danes. Fields extended 
his game point streak to 22, 
which means he has scored or 
assisted in 22 games straight for 
UAlbany.
UAlbany will have little time 
to rest, as they take the road to 
face UMass in Amherst Tues-
day, March 8.

HOOLEY’S GOODBYE

BASKETBALL

By PETER HOOLEY
S

enior basketball player Peter Hooley 
offered an open letter to the Univer-
sity at Albany. This letter was writ-
ten after the UAlbany men’s team fell to 
Hartford in the America East Quarterfinal 
Wednesday night. Hooley told the newspa-
per he wrote this at 4 a.m., unable to sleep 
after the game.  

I don’t know where to begin. But, five years ago, I made 
the decision to come across the other side of the world 
and try my luck at college basketball in the United States. 
Looking back, never in my wildest dreams would I have 
envisioned the journey I have had, and I owe it to everyone 
who has been around me throughout my time. 
I was just a small country kid from South Australia when 
I was given the chance to come here to play basketball. I had 
no intentions of ever playing Division I basketball, but I got 
this chance. I had no intentions of ever having the success 
I have had over my time here, but I did. I had no intentions 
of ever gaining a second family across the other side of the 
world, but I have. 
I guess the normal trend of college sport is to come and 
play at a high level, get an education and then be on your 
way after that. But I never saw it like that. I saw a program 
and a community that took me in as one of their own and 
showed me an experience that I still cannot fathom. And for 
that, I say thank you.
From the moment I stepped foot on this campus in 2011, I 
could never have predicted how my life would turn out over 
the next five years. From championships on the court to dual 
degrees in the classroom, my life will forever be different 
because of my time here. Through all my ups and downs, I 
have seen the true value of life firsthand, and the fragileness 
of it as well. I have always believed that family is the most 
important thing in the world, and I am special enough to 
have two of them on the opposite sides of the planet. 
Thank you to all the fans of the program who have ridden 
every high and every low with me and our teams for the past 
five years. We do everything for you because we see how 
much we all enjoy success together. 
Thank you to the university for showing me how to 
not only get a great education and be surrounded by some 
incredible people, but to also show me that school goes 
much further than simply sitting in a classroom. Every 
student that has been through this university will forever be 
connected, because we all have this place together. I was so 

grateful to have the opportunity to speak on behalf 
of my graduating class last year, and I am so 
thankful to have been able to enjoy my academics 
as well as prosper in them. 
Thank you to all my coaches who I have had 
over my career for getting me to where I am today 
on the basketball court. You took a small town 
country kid from Australia and helped me achieve 
more success than I could have ever dreamed of. 
Three championships in succession, along with 
many other incredible memories. You helped 
me grow and you helped me shine, and for that I 
thank you.
Thank you Coach Brown, for not only helping me to 
reach my full potential as a basketball player, but for also 
being something much more to me as a person. I don’t 
think players are supposed to have had the relationship we 
had, but the way you watched over me and guided me in 
all my ways of life, I can never say thank you enough for. 
Whenever I struggled or fell, your door was always open 
to help me stand again.  You could have taken a chance on 
anyone else, but you chose me. You never knew who I was, 
heck, you probably didn’t even know if I could really play 
basketball, but you took a chance. We have been through a 
lot together, but the one thing that I will forever remember is 
how you have helped me become the man I am today. So for 
so many things, I say thank you. 
Thank you to my teammates, all of them who I have had 
the privilege of playing alongside across my time here. I 
shouldn’t refer to you as just teammates, because you are 
so much more than that, you are my brothers. Through all 
the highs and all the lows, you showed me the true value of 
a team, but even more so, you showed me the true value of 
family. I love you all. I will forever miss our locker room 
shenanigans and bus rides, but when we see each other again 
years down the track, I can’t wait to bask in the memories 
together. I wish you all the most success in your future 
endeavors you are all destined for greatness in so many 
different ways, and best believe I will be following your 
every move. Purplefam for life. 
Taking away all my on court and off court success, I 
have managed to have the time of my life here at UAlbany. 
I learned so much about myself along this journey that I 
have become a better man for it. I have made friends for 
life and a second home that will always be here for me. I 
don’t know how many people can truly say that, so I feel 
deeply privileged to have been a part of such a great school, 
program and community. I gave everything I had to this 
place, and my only regret is that I can’t do it all again. I hope 
that I have left my mark on some people’s lives and made 
them better, because that has always been important to me. 

I leave this place a better basketballer, a better student but 
perhaps most importantly, a better person. And ultimately, 
that’s all I could have ever asked for. 
I used to think that playing basketball at college in 
America would be the toughest challenge I would face when 
I first came here. But I was wrong. The toughest challenge 
was being able to take all the highs and lows that college 
throws at you and still stand. It was being able to realize 
that college is all about making mistakes and learning from 
them and growing and becoming better for it. College is 
a stepping-stone to your future, and I have left so many 
beautiful footprints behind me as I have stepped on forth.
If I had to give advice to anyone who was about to take 
a step towards their college life, it would be quite simple - 
enjoy every single moment. Laugh when you can and cry 
when you have to. Live in every moment and don’t look 
back, it’ll be over before you know it. And always... always, 
be thankful and put others first, because you never know 
what could happen next.
My time here is nearly at an end, and it truly saddens 
me to see it go. But all good things must come to an end, I 
guess.
I don’t know what God has in store for me next, but what 
I know for sure is that I will forever be a Great Dane and I 
will forever have a special home right here!

From the bottom of my heart,

Thank you, Albany.

Senior Ray Sanders’s 13 points weren’t enough for the Great Danes as they fell to Hartford at SEFCU Arena 
Wednesday night.

Tournament play cut short for UAlbany men’s basketball

By BRYAN SAUR

The University at Albany men’s basketball season came 
to a shocking end Wednesday night. The Great Danes were 
upset by No. 7-seeded Hartford (10-22, 4-12) 68-59 in the 
America East quarterfinals.
The No. 2-seeded UAlbany (24-8, 13-3) started slowly, 
shooting just 28.6 percent from the field in the first half. 
It was the complete opposite for the Hawks, who were 
seemingly making every shot they took. They shot 48.3 
percent, including an unprecedented nine of 13 from beyond 
the arc.
Before they knew it, the Danes found themselves walking 
into the locking room down 17 points at halftime.
“We lost that game in the first half,” UAlbany Head Coach 
Will Brown said.  “You can’t dig yourself a hole down 17 and 
give a team all of that confidence.”
Despite facing a large deficit, the resilient UAlbany squad 

wouldn’t go down without a fight.
Mid-way through the second half the Danes began to find 
their stride. Freshman Joe Cremo made one of his signature 
drives to the hoop and finished with a lay-in and a foul. The 
three-point play cut the Hartford lead to 11 and brought 
thunderous cheers from the fans at SEFCU arena, which were 
missing for most of the game. Perhaps the most disappointing 
was the absence of the football team. At almost all the home 
games, the UAlbany football team wo would take over a 
good portion of the stands with their big bodies dressed up in 
superhero costumes. This first tournament game could have 
used their superhero power.
The Danes turned up the pressure in the second half, going 
to a full-court pressure and doubling the ball as soon as it got 
over halfcourt, which the Hawks had trouble dealing with, 
resulting in several turnovers.
Cremo created another turnover at halfcourt and dished the 
ball off to Ray Sanders, who was fouled on a made layup. The 

three-point play cut the Hawks lead to five with 1:27 to play.
SEFCU was rocking with excitement, hoping this would 
not be the last game for the Danes and their senior class which 
features Peter Hooley, Evan Singletary, Ray Sanders and 
Reece Williams.
But the Hawks had other ideas.
On the following possession, the Hawks played keep-
away, passing the ball all over the court to keep it out of 
UAlbany’s hands. A swing pass to the corner found JR 
Lynch, who drained the dagger three-pointer that put the 
Hawks up eight points with less than a minute to play.
The shot brought a devastating silence to the fans cheering 
for the purple and gold. Meanwhile, the Hawks bench 
was ecstatic after realizing what they were just about to 
accomplish.
The reality then sank in. The Great Danes will not be the 
America East champions for the fourth year in a row. 
During free throws at the end of the game, Brown made 
substitutions for his three graduating seniors: Hooley, 
Sanders, and Singletary, who each received standing ovations 
from the UAlbany faithful.
Following the game, the whole team stood at halfcourt, 
listening to cheers from the fans who remained to say 
goodbye. All of the players walked off the court together for 
the final time this season, except for Hooley.
The senior from Australia squatted down on the UAlbany 
logo and took a moment for himself to reflect on the fact that 
he would not return to this court again as a UAlbany player. 
Then he walked off the court for the final time.
“Coach took a chance on a small kid from Australia and I 
ended up making a family here,” Hooley said after the game 
while fighting back tears. “I owe a lot to these people, but I 
can’t say thank you enough for what they have done for me.”
Despite the upset loss, Brown still found the positive in a 
first-round exit that is unfamiliar for his time at UAlbany.
“I’m proud of my team. This loss doesn’t define our 
season,” Brown said. “We were 24-8. This is extremely 
disappointing, but it’s been a great year.”
Even though the graduating seniors didn’t walk off the 
court the way they had envisioned, it does not change the 
careers they had and contributions they made to the UAlbany 
community. Hooley finishes his legendary career with three 
America East championships, while Sanders and Singletary 
won their first after transferring to UAlbany last season. 
Their time at UAlbany will end in a few months, but the 
legacy they left on this program will always be remembered. 
Especially for Hooley, who is one of the UAlbany men’s all-
time leading scorers. 
Although UAlbany will not qualify for the NCAA 
tournament, they still have a chance to receive an invitation 
to the National Invitational Tournament (N.I.T.) or College 
Basketball Invitational (C.B.I.), which cross-town rival Siena 
won two years ago.
