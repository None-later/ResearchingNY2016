T

he typical gender wage 
gap is turned upside 
down in Albany -- 
women are actually 
paid more than men, 
according to information from the U.S. 
Census Bureau. But salary informa-
tion shows that this is not the case at 
the University at Albany, where men 
are annually paid thousands of dollars 
more than women on average.
By using information such as 
median earnings from 2013 and five 
year growth in median earnings from 
2009-2013, researchers from Spare-

Foot, a blog that covers information 
relating to moving and storage, labeled 
the Albany-Schenectady-Troy metro 
area as the No. 1 Most Glass Ceiling 
Shattering City in the U.S. In the last 
five years, Albany women’s median 
earnings have raised 7.1 percent as 
a percentage of men’s, meaning the 
wage gap between the genders is con-
tinuing to narrow. 
This is not the case at UAlbany.
According to FindTheBest.com, 
a search engine owned by Graphix 
designed to organize data, male 
professors at UAlbany make almost 
$20,000 more annually than the fe-
male professors. While the men make 

approximately $158,000 annually, the 
women earn slightly more than an av-
erage of $138,000 across all UAlbany 
campuses. 
Other SUNY schools exhibit the 
same trend. SUNY Buffalo pays 
its male professors slightly above 
$21,000 more annually than the fe-
male professors, according to the same 
website. Binghamton pays $12,000 
more, Stony Brook pays $7,000 more, 
Cortland pays almost $3,500 more, 
and Potsdam pays $2,500 more to its 
male professors.

UALBANY’S 
WAGE GAP

The city of Albany ranks high among U.S. cities when it comes to closing the gender wage gap. But the University 
at Albany bucks that positive trend and exhibits the old-fashioned wage gap across many positions.

RESEARCH

By CONNOR MURPHY

If drones are a thing of 
the future, Alexander Buy-
antuev and a team of eight 
others at the University at 
Albany refuse to be left in 
the past. 
After receiving approxi-
mately $10,000 from the 
National Science Founda-
tion (NSF), Buyantuev, an 
assistant professor, will be 
using unmanned aircraft 
systems (UAS) to practice 
phenology—defined by 
Merriam-Webster as “a 
branch of science dealing 
with the relations between 
climate and periodic bio-
logical phenomena”—in 
multiple areas of Upstate 
New York.
“Primarily [drones] are 
just a tool for me to collect 
spatial data,” Buyantuev 
said.
A geographer and 
ecologist by training in his 
native Russia, as well as at 
Arizona State University, 
he expects the results of 
his research to end up like 
Google Earth, only cheaper 
and more specifically de-
tailed with drones instead of 
satellites.
“There’s a lot for me 

to learn,” Buyantuev said 
while rummaging through 
a box [with-OF?] one of 
his models, a First-person 
view (FPV) Precision 
Hawk. Luckily he has a 
drone simulator, as well as 
an in with the Albany-area 
drone community, to help 
him learn sooner rather than 
later.
Buyantuev and his team 
plan on working at Huyck 
Preserve, 25 miles from 
UAlbany’s main campus 
and the Albany Pine Bush 
Preserve. Huyck is an area 
the professor is comfortable 
with, as there are pictures 
of it on “Phenocam,” an 
academic website that has 
cameras set up across the 
country to snap pictures of 
an area over an extended 
period of time.
Pine Bush is trickier 
because of its closeness 
to Albany International 
Airport. Due to the FAA 
Modernization and Reform 
Act of 2012, drones can-
not be flown “within five 
miles of an airport unless 
you contact the airport and 
control tower before fly-
ing.” The research team’s 
conduct requires differ-

Small, clean, quaint and quiet: 
These are a few ways to describe 
the Fuller Road restaurant Dave’s 
Gourmet and Exotic Burgers. 
But Dave Kahn, owner and 
head chef, is the exact opposite, as 
he bellows out eccentricities and 
funny jokes. He’s a man without 
a filter. 
One example: if you ask for a 
burger cooked well done, he’ll 
bark, “If you order that I’ll have 
to shoot you!”. But it’s all in good 
fun, and it’s definitely worth put-
ting up with.

Kahn, with his 
short dark hair and 
salt-and-pepper 
goatee, makes the 
best burgers in town 
— and his personal-
ity is just as spunky 
and absurd as the 
items featured on 
his menu. 
Kahn special-
izes in exotic 
burgers. You can 
find rare meats on 
his menu ranging 
from antelope to 
alligator and wild 

boar to rattlesnake, 
and everything in 
between.
At one time, 
he even had lion 
on his menu. Yes, 
you read that right 
-- actual lion meat! 
The Albany Times 
Union wrote an 
article about how 
the animal conser-
vation demonstra-
tors protested the 
king-of-the-jungle-
burger right off the 
menu. 

The Times Union also profiled 
Kahn and his restaurant on more 
than one occasion and each review 
gave high stars to his cooking and 
the quality of his burgers. 
And it’s true -- the man knows 
how to craft a gourmet burger. 
Not convinced? See the reviews 
for yourself. Kahn has earned four 
and a half stars on Yelp.com.
The restaurant is a hidden gem, 
easily passable if you are not 
looking for it, off of Fuller Road. 
It’s a one-man operation -- Kahn 
manages and cooks everything by

UAlbany amps up 
intramurals offerings

The University at Albany added a whopping 24 programs this semester, bringing the grand total up 
to 36 intramural sports.

A petition on change.org aims 
to shut down Crossgates Mall this 
Thanksgiving. 
The petition, “Force Crossgates 
Mall (and other Pyramid Malls) 
to stay closed on Thanksgiving,” 
has nearly 1,000 supporters. It 
was created by Arthur Fudge, an 
associate manager at T-Mobile ac-
cording to his Facebook page.
“We are here to put a stop to 
the madness,” Fudge wrote in the 
description of his petition. “No 
longer should we allow corporate 
greed to influence our family and 
take away from the precious and 
cherished moments of our lives.”
The petition includes a letter 
addressed to Pyramid Manage-
ment Group Chief Executive Of-
ficer Stephen J. Congel, President 
Timothy J. Kelley, Crossgates 
Marketing Director Jennifer 
Smith, and the entire Pyramid 
Management Group.
“Forcing retail locations to 
remain open robs employees and 
their families the opportunity to 
enjoy the holiday,” the letter says. 
It later adds, “Please be thank-
ful to your loyal employees, 
customers and retailers in your 
mall locations and remain closed 
this upcoming holiday.”
Pyramid Management Group 

owns Crossgates Mall as well as 
15 other shopping centers in the 
Northeast, according to the port-
folio on the company’s website. 
This includes Destiny USA in 
Syracuse, the United States’ sixth 
largest shopping mall. 
Although Crossgates has closed 
down on Thanksgiving in past 
years, including 2012 and 2013, it 
opened from 6 p.m. last year and 
stayed open until the following 
night at 10 p.m. for Black Friday, 

according to the holiday hours 
listed on the Crossgates website. 
There is no word yet as to 
whether or not Crossgates intends 
to have the same hours this year, 
according to the Crossgates Mall 
Office.
The petition points out that 
opening at 6 p.m. means being at 
work at a time when most people 
would be sitting down for dinner 
with their families.
Alexander Flood, a junior at 

the University at Albany, works at 
H&M, a clothing store in Cross-
gates Mall. He shared the link to 
the petition on his personal Face-
book page and urged his friends to 
sign it. 
“It is absurd to think that my 
coworkers and I should be sacri-
ficing time with our families just 
because corporate America has 
decided it so,” Flood said. “We 
are people with families and we 
deserve our holidays off.”

He also believes that this is 
evidence of a larger problem. 
“All of this is indicative of how 
corporate greed and a couple of 
very wealthy people are ripping 
the American people off while 
everyday people struggle simply 
to get by,” Flood said.
Other students are choosing not 
to support the petition, such as 
Victoria Smith, a UAlbany sopho-
more who works at a children’s 
store in the mall. She receives 
special holiday pay from working 
on Thanksgiving. 
“I’d love to have Thanksgiv-
ing off but I also need the extra 
money,” Smith said. 
Not all retailers pay their 
employees extra for working on 
holidays. The New York State La-
bor Law does not require employ-
ers to give workers more money 
on holidays. However, Article 6 
of the law states that it is illegal to 
agree to give an employee holiday 
pay and fail to do so. 
According to the National Ar-
chives, Thanksgiving is a national 
holiday. It falls on Nov. 26 this 
year. 
Despite numerous emails and 
phone calls, Pyramid Management 
Group has not made a comment. 
The petition can be found by 
searching its title on change.org.

The number of programs open 
to students at the University at 
Albany tripled this semester. 24 
new intramural sports are being 
offered now.
Campus Recreation had only 
12 programs last semester, but 
now has a total of 36, according 
to UAlbany’s NewsCenter.
Previously, the only Intramural 
sports offered to students were 
flag football, soccer, indoor soc-
cer, softball, sand-pit volleyball, 
basketball, ultimate frisbee, and 
some tournament-style sports, 

according to the FAQ page on 
Campus Recreation’s page for 
Intramural sports. 
Karl Luntta, director of media 
relations at UAlbany, says sports 
such as kickball, tennis, badmin-
ton, lawn games, and a Friday 
Night Basketball League have 
been added to the list.
Women’s and Co-Ed divisions 
are being added to the program, 
giving leagues the option to have 
gender-specific teams. 
“In the past, all teams were put 
into the same league no matter if 
there were females on a team or 
not,” Luntta said.

Registration for most sports 
takes place between the beginning 
of September and the beginning 
of November. 
Intramural sports are played 
amongst UAlbany students. Any 
graduate or undergraduate student 
who pays the Student Activity 
Fee is welcome to join one. The 
policies and rules for 15 of the 
sports are located on the webpage 
for Intramural sports.

SAY WHAT?

 "I think that UAlbany having drones would be a great idea for 
the campus. It is being used in a way that prevents any human 
interaction with the wildlife that could potentially affect the 
results of study. Furthermore, it allows for better evaluation of the 
environment that couldn't be seen using previous tactics.”

- Francis Dougherty, 
Class of 2017

This week, we asked students: 

How do you feel about drone usage on 
UAlbany’s campus?

    “ I think it is a great idea in 
which it gives another option to 
observe and track environmental 
changes. With the way we are 
treating our planet, we could 
always use more options. 
However, I also believe that 
it can be used for non-related 
purposes. Once that type of 
power is given, it can easily be 
abused.” 

- Victoria Maresca, 
Graduate Student

t’s an old trope: The college student 
who never has enough money to eat 
or, better yet, lives off of the “Ramen” 
diet. If we take the time to sit back and 
think about why college students never 
have any money, we would all come to a 
similar conclusion—tuition is too damn 
high.
   I think I speak for most students when 
I say that tuition should be free. College 
students move away from home, many all 
on their own, and have to forage in un-
charted territory for the general necessities 
of life. A lot of college students cannot rely 
on their parents or relatives’ cash to get 
through a hard time. With the added factor 
of tuition weighing on their shoulders, this 
isn’t an easy path to take.
   At the University at Albany, tuition and 
fees for the 2015-2016 academic year are a 
whopping $10,164, a 4.6 percent increase 
from last year, according to the university’s 
website. And that’s only for in-state stu-
dents. Out-of-state students have to cough 
up $23,284, a 9 percent increase. These 
numbers don’t include room and board and 

meal plan costs. 
   I know what you’re thinking: What about 
financial aid? Yes, a lot of college students 
do receive a substantial amount of financial 
aid, but some don’t. Either way, allow me 
to take you to a place where you won’t 
need financial aid—Germany.
   According to a Washington Post article 
by Rick Noack, “The country’s universities 
have been tuition-free since the beginning 
of October, when Lower Saxony became 
the last state to scrap the fees.”
   I bet everyone is going to start moving to 
Germany. And in even better news, Ger-
man universities offer classes in English 
with “courses ranging from engineering to 
social sciences.”
   In the same article, appropriately titled, 
“7 countries where Americans can study at 
universities, in English, for free (or almost 
free),” the Washington Post lists a handful 
of other countries that a student can attend 
university for little to no money.  Other 
countries include: Finland, Sweden, Nor-
way and Brazil. 
   In the article, Dorothee Stapelfeldt, a 
senator in the northern city of Hamburg, 
Germany, said “tuition fees ‘discourage 
young people who do not have a traditional 

academic family background from taking 
up study.  It is a core task of politics to en-
sure that young women and men can study 
with a high quality standard free of charge 
in Germany.’”
   It is becoming possible to achieve a 
degree here in the states as well. The 
University of Illinois is creating a special 
iMBA course to be introduced in the spring 
of 2016. A student who is admitted in this 
program can take six for-credit courses 
toward a master’s degree in business all 
online. All one has to do is apply, given 
they have achieved a bachelor’s degree 
or equivalent. Neither the GRE nor the 
GMAT are necessary to get in, but are 
recommended. A student will also need a 
personal statement, letters of recommenda-
tion and proof of proficiency in English. 
   The University of Illinois’ website offers 
an interested student the chance to get more 
information on the program by clicking a 
further link. 
   “Like most free things, however, there’s 
a catch,” a writer in a Chicago Business 
article says. “While all the classes for the 
MBA will be available online, those who 
want an actual MBA from the University 
of Illinois, not just a certificate, will have 

to apply for admission to the full iMBA 
program and pay about $20,000 in tuition.” 
   But this is still a decent head start into the 
world of free tuition.
   Other schools, like Harvard, are moving 
into online business degrees as well. For its 
part, UAlbany has announced that, starting 
this semester, a bachelor’s of science de-
gree in Informatics can be earned through 
an online program. It is only a matter of 
time before schools all across the nation 
start to adopt online programs.
   Hopefully this leads to free programs, 
online or otherwise, in the U.S., like many 
other universities across the globe.
   Students are putting in the effort to jump-
start their lives and careers, though it’s 
increasingly hard when we are worrying 
about how to pay for school. It’s this prob-
lem that discourages the intellectual elite to 
look into the “Harvards” and “Columbias” 
of the world because they simply cannot 
afford to go there. It is time to end students 
having to pay for their intellect and allow 
them to attend university based on merit 
alone, without the added influence of the 
cost of tuition.

C

onsider what kind of impact the 
nearly 18,000 University at Albany 
students could have on this election 
if most of them were registered to vote at 
their college address and voted in the elec-
tion. The student body of our university 
would be a constituency that the county 
executive could not ignore.  
While the political focus of the nation 
and the media is “Trump this” and “Hillary 
that,” the 2015 elections are being over-
looked. It is typical for the country to be 
more engaged in national issues than local, 
especially among younger voters. Over 40 
percent of voters ages 18-29 voted in the 
2012 presidential election, and only about 
20 percent voted in the 2014 midterms. 
Rates decrease across the board as elections 
become more local.
This is a huge missed opportunity, 
especially for young voters at big universi-
ties like the UAlbany, where there is high 
potential to influence local politics. In this 
year’s election cycle, the Albany County 
Executive and county legislators are on the 
ballot. Incumbent Dan McCoy won in the 
last election with just under 50,000 votes.
Albany County makes policies and 
provide services that impact all students 
at UAlbany. These include property and 
sales tax rates, the county sheriff, county 
roadways and sewer districts maintenance, 
administering Medicaid and providing 
social services. It definitely makes the lives 
of UAlbany students better when rent is 
affordable, sewers are functioning and the 
poor are taken care of instead wandering 
the streets begging for food and medicine.
The College Democrats are one example 

of a student group that is involved 
in local politics. They are an excep-
tion to the rule that young people 
are unlikely to participate in local 
elections. 
“It kind of bugs me a little bit 
because people don’t understand 
that at the local level, that’s where 
things really happen,” Christian 
Chowdhury, president of the Col-
lege Democrats, says. 
The UAlbany College Democrats 
have been successful in influencing 
election results in recent years and 
have won the national chapter of the 
year award in 2011, 2013 and 2015. 
Chowdhury thinks that the larger 
student body at UAlbany can have a 
similar impact.
“I think we can change elec-
tions … I think it will give students 
a bigger voice in local elections. 
[Candidates] will be more likely to 
listen to us,” he said.
While there is high potential to 
influence local elections like the 
county executive’s race, the poten-
tial to influence county legislative 
districts is even higher. The cam-
pus is split between two districts: 
numbers 12 and 32. In 2011, Wil-
liam Clay won district 12 (which includes 
Colonial and State Quads) with 421 votes. 
The number of UAlbany students living 
in that district dwarfs that total, and the 
students can (theoretically) pick their own 
candidates. 
It is even possible to elect a highly mo-
tivated and competent student from those 
living areas, which would be a sweet part 
time gig for a student -- salaries average 
over $30,000. The other half of the campus 

is represented by Mary Lou Connolly, 
which would be a harder district to win 
with a turnout of over 1,100 in 2011. Still, 
there are enough UAlbany students in that 
district that if registered and active, could 
dictate who represents us at the campus 
level.
Getting involved and organized enough 
so that students routinely elect UAlbany 
students would take years, but it is possible 
by the next round of county elections in 
2019. Meanwhile, there is an interesting 

Democratic primary in the County Execu-
tive race on Thursday, where Dan Egen 
is challenging incumbent Dan McCoy. 
Egan has received high profile progressive 
endorsements, including Cuomo’s 2014 
primary challenger Zephyr Teachout, who 
won Albany County by a wide margin in 
2014. 
Fulfilling the potential of the student 
body to play a role of local politics has to 
start with simply taking interest in what is 
happening in the local environment.

changed for years is a huge deal. 
Sometimes it works, and some-
times it falls flat on its face.
The Albany Student Press is 
taking a chance with its newly 
designed paper, celebrating 100 
years of publication. The paper’s 

redesign could potentially bring in 
a new crop of readers who are en-
ticed by the lighter feel and pops 
of color. The ASP has a fresh new 
face.
This is not to say that it will 
necessarily work. But the ASP is 
in good company.
Other newspapers have tried 
their hand at redesigning their lay-

outs in hopes of revitalizing their 
paper. According to an article 
from June in the Guardian by Roy 
Greenslade, the Daily Telegraph 
decided to revamp its layout for 
its 160th anniversary, a decision 
similar fashion to the ASP’s. 
Chris Evans, the Daily Tele-
graph editor said in the article 
it,  “‘makes our articles far more 
readable.’” There is 
an increased text size 
that may cut down the 
content by a marginal 
amount, but Evans is 
willing to take that sac-
rifice if it can make the 
paper more readable for 
the audience. 
Audience involve-
ment and investment is 
the goal here. The ASP 
has many readers across 
campus, but a refreshing 
take on the paper and 
a visible difference in 
text, layout and picture 
quality can be key in 
drawing in a crowd of 
students who are other-
wise not looking for the 
newspaper. 
The local Times 
Union produces the 
new design of the ASP, 
featuring higher qual-
ity photos and colored 
pages, giving off more 
of a magazine-style feel 
and readability. 
I am always interest-
ed in change and finding 
a new groove that may 
be a better fit for the 
changing times. In this 
day and age, a physical 
newspaper really has to 

fight hard to combat all of the on-
line media sources, including the 
less credible social media outlets, 
like Facebook and Twitter.
The Chicago Reader is also 
getting a facelift, thanks to its new 
editor Jake Malooney. Accord-
ing to an article by Lynne Marek 
in Chicago Business, the news-
paper will rid itself of the “‘B 
Side’” back cover, which will be 
shifted inside the weekly, with the 
upside-down type in the back of 
the book turned around so readers 
won’t have to flip the paper over 
to continue reading.”
It seems like now is a perfect 
time for change and many news-
papers are taking that cue.
Of course, no one can forget 
about the biggest reason to put 
out a newspaper: to inform read-
ers. The best way to do that is to 
make a paper version that can be 
read across the board, from to 
the diehard sports fans flipping 
straight to the back cover to the 
newspaper enthusiasts. What ev-
ery paper needs to do is transcend 
all categories of people that they 
could encounter and make a paper 
that is easily accessible to all. 
A redesign can do just that. 
I only hope for the best for the 
ASP, but I certainly cannot say if 
the redesign will be the best in the 
long run. The ASP has been doing 
reasonably well for its first issue. 
Clearly the new look of the paper 
is resonating well (and maybe 
better than ever) with the student 
body at the University at Albany. 
Hopefully this stream of good 
fortune can continue to surround 
the ASP as they move forward. 
Only time will tell how suc-
cessful the redesign will be. 

A change has come: 
new design for new readers

There has been continuous construction at the university for a few years. The Campus Center construction 
has been ongoing since last year.

CAMPUS LIFE

As summer was winding down, 
I kept thinking about how the 
Campus Center would look and 
how different the scenery walk-
ing from Indian Quad would be. 
There would be no more loud 
construction near my building, 
no more workers buzzing around, 
and no more passing the adver-
tisement with false hope that it 
would be completed soon. 
Come move-in day, I was 
oozing with excitement. I’d just 
gotten settled in and I was starv-
ing. The dining halls weren’t open 
yet so I decided to grab a bite at 
the Campus Center, itching for 
a stuffed chicken burrito from 
Wholly Habaneros. With my 
mouth watering, I rushed to the 
main entrance only to find doors 
to a closed-off section with a 
desk of people directing students 
where everything is now located.  
Thrown off by how the Center 
was shaped, I walked downstairs 
still hoping for my burrito. When 
I got to the dining services, all 
I saw were walls and Cusato’s 
Pizza. I was vastly confused. I de-
cided to walk around the Center, 
only to see that there were walls 
blocking everything, making it 
look dull and boring. I went to the 
bookstore and saw the new East 
Addition, looking very promising, 
but still closed.
According to the university’s 
website in the facilities manage-
ment page, the newly designed 
East Addition is set to open 
Monday, Sept. 7. The East Addi-
tion will be a 21,000 square-foot 

addition with a double 
height dining room and six 
food service venues, a sub-
basement catering kitchen, 
a service tunnel and loading 
dock, and a below-storage 
space for the bookstore. 
New dining services will 
also surface in the East Ad-
dition, including: East Deli, 
Fountain Grill, Jazzman’s, 
Stalks and Stems, and a fa-
miliar face, Cusato’s Pizza. 
The Addition is only 
one phase of a two-part 
construction project, with 
the West Addition to be 
completed in late 2016. 
The West Addition will be 
55,000 square-foot addition 
with a 400 seat, multi-use 
auditorium, a multi-use 
rehearsal room, student 
group office suites, a food 
service venue, a two-level 
fitness center, a meditation 
room, student group resource 
spaces, and various lounges 
and meeting rooms.
The Campus Center is a place 
filled with energy where all 
students can enjoy different food 
venues, grab textbooks and all 
sorts of Albany gear, and most 
importantly, it’s a place where 
students can relax and hang 
around with their peers. But now 
whenever I walk in I get a dull 
vibe, since a majority of the Cam-
pus Center is now blocked off. 
One of UAlbany’s most impor-
tant features being closed is a big 
issue. Many students also go to 

the Campus Center to enjoy the 
variety of dining options it offers, 
as opposed to the dining halls 
With it being closed off, students 
are stuck using limited meal 
swipes at the dining halls. Some 
meal plans provide more munch 
money than meal swipes, so what 
are those students with those meal 
plans supposed to do without the 
Campus Center? The reconstruc-
tion of the Center gives students 
very limited space and few lounge 
options for relaxing between 
classes. Many groups on campus 
also advertise and hold meetings 

in the building, but the construc-
tion provides limited space for 
everyone to fit. 
So what are we, as students, 
supposed to do without the build-
ing, which won’t be finished until 
late 2016? Although the East 
Addition will be completed and 
open on Sept. 7, will it still look 
off-limits and dull considering the 
West Addition won’t be com-
pleted? 
While we can still enjoy the 
first phase of the Campus Center, 
are we willing to wait to see it 
fully completed? 

B

efore entering my sophomore year 
at the University at Albany, there 
were many things I was looking 
forward to: seeing my friends and the 
gorgeous fountain, living on my own, 
and going to the Campus Center, one of 
my favorite places in the university.

An eerily lit suburban street. 
Unsuspecting teens throwing a 
party. A mutant family attacking 
unsuspecting travelers. Any of 
these horror movie tropes seem 
familiar? That’s because they were 
all introduced by horror film leg-
end Wes Craven. The highly ac-
claimed director, writer, producer, 
and actor passed away on Aug. 30 
of brain cancer at the age of 76.
Craven was best known for 
directing and writing the popu-
lar film “A Nightmare on Elm 
Street,” which was released in 
1984 and featured one of the hor-
ror genre’s iconic villains, Freddy 
Krueger. Other notable mentions 
are his direction of “Scream” 
(1996), as well as “The Hills Have 
Eyes” (1977), “The Last House 
on the Left” (1972), “Red Eye” 
(2005), and “My Soul to Take” 
(2010). 
Craven was born in 1939 in 
Cleveland, OH and received a 
B.A. in Psychology and English 
from Wheaton College in Illinois. 
He went on to earn a master’s 

degree in Philosophy and Writing 
from John’s Hopkins University, 
then becoming a humanities pro-
fessor at Clarkson College in Pots-
dam, NY. He aspired to become a 
novelist or short story writer.
Growing tired of teaching, 
Craven made the decision to move 
to New York City where he was 
offered a job at a post-production 
job doing sound editing. He began 
making a name for himself in 
the film industry during the early 
1970s, with his first directorial, 
writing, and editing debut hit “The 
Last House on the Left.” The 
chilling slasher film was made on 
a budget of $87,000 and became 
a commercial success grossing $3 
million at the box office.
“The Last House on the Left” 
and “The Hills Have Eyes” were 
noted for being extremely grue-
some, gritty, and explicit films 
featuring brutal abuse, upset-
ting many viewers and critics. 
Craven divulged from this style 
into a more surreal, supernatural 
and humorous feel with his next 
installments.
“A Nightmare on Elm Street” 

was both written and directed by 
Craven, and went on to become 
a classic cult film. The movie fo-
cuses on recurrent themes in youth 
slasher films such as the conse-
quences of sexual promiscuity 
among teens and the immorality 
of drinking, drugs and partying. 
This also marked the introduction 
of dark humor in his films, with 
often comical death scenarios and 
the wisecracking villain Freddy 
Krueger. This sense of humor is 
also exemplified in “Scream,” the 
self-aware horror film that often 
references its own cliché and out-
rageous horror scenarios.
When describing his entry into 
the horror genre, Craven explained 
that he was not originally inter-
ested in writing scary movies. 
“It’s always struck me as kind 
of weird that I fell into making 
scary pictures,” said Craven in an 
interview with AV Club. “It was 
just that Sean had some guys with 
some money who wanted to make 
a movie that was interesting, and it 
had to be scary. I literally remem-
ber a conversation along the lines

Horror film legend Wes Craven on set for the documentary 
“Scream: The Inside Story.”

   The University Art Museum hosted a 
gallery of artworks from local artists in 
the Mohawk and Hudson regions. They 
varied in age and background, but each had 
a unique view of life and the world. The 
art ranged from oil on canvas, C-print, and 
mixed media on panel, to 3-D sculptures, 
cardboard encaustic, videos and poetry. 

What inspired you to create “Towards 
An Isle of Ever Fateful Humility and 
Then Some?”

Sarah Fuhrman: I think that I was read-
ing a manifesto about bio-politics when I 
dreamt up the scene in this piece. I was in 
grad school for my MFA, and I remember 
discussing the aesthetic philosophies of 
Adorno in tandem with this gender and 
bio-technology themed reading during a 
seminar. This was based on a silly little day 
dream that I had as I watched undergradu-
ate women dance around the extensively 
dangerous sculpture studio in tight, short, 
revealing outfits. 

What inspired you to create “Crimson 
Scape?”

Katria Foster: It is one piece out of a se-
ries of work. This work was born out of my 
desire to take mundane things and elevate 
them into something at least visually inter-
esting. I also wanted to create photographs 
whose space was strange—space that was 
unable to be judged in terms of scale. All 
of this work centers around the feelings as-
sociated with my spirituality. 

What inspired you to create “In Full 
Bloom and “A Place of Clear Water?”

Susan Crowe: I make the work to better 
understand my place in the landscape and 
to express what that experience feels and 
looks like. In both wall pieces I have re-
duced the pictorial and structural elements 
to the minimalist of forms as a way of 
highlighting the way in which the contours 
of form give landscape its visual power.  
The printed papers help to anchor us in the 
natural world through photographic images 
of nature and painterly depictions of it.  

What inspired you to create the “Love 
Series?”

Nancy Powhida: A real life love experi-
ence inspired me to make the love series. 
I was reunited with my first boyfriend and 
love. 

What inspired you to create “Shelter” 
and “Milk Drinker’s Blues”?

Brian Cirmo: Everything I make is 
sparked by what I’m reading, what painters 
I’m looking at, and what music I’m listen-
ing to at that time. “Shelter” came from 
the Bob Dylan song, “Shelter From The 
Storm.”

Why did you select your chosen 
medium?

SF:  Painting and drawing are the most 
sincere ways of storytelling for me. I find 
that through pigment application with 
brushstrokes, and gestural, repetitive mark-
making, I can fully express notions and 
scenes that I find important. 

KF: I enjoy the tactile qualities of 
working with paint or inks but I enjoy 
the altered reality I can create with a 
camera. So the process of creating this 
body of work gave me the ability to 
build and manipulate the materials I was 
setting in front of the camera and the 
control to manipulate the space further 
with the use of the camera.

SC: Constructing with forms out of 
cardboard came out of my teaching art 
courses at Queens College in New York. 

BC: Oil paint is alive to me. No mate-
rial smells, moves, conjures, or  fights 
back quite like oil paint. It’s sexy and 

stubborn all at once.

NP: I have found insulation board an 
easy medium for carving and composing 
with zip glue. I was initially just making 
maquettes for possible larger works. But 
the maquette works have taken on a life of 
their own.

Why did you choose to become an artist?

SF:   It was what I was best at as a child 
and a young adult, and because it was what 
I liked to do most. I am also a rebel, and 
a bit of a punk, so I do not like being told 
what to do, and have found that I often do 
the exact opposite of what I am told to do, 
without even thinking about it. As such, I 
have found myself in the shoes of an artist, 
whether it be for better or for worse. 

KF: I think what led me to art was that I 
kept making connections and falling into 
really great opportunities. This led me to 
believe it wasn’t a scary choice to study art 
in college and to become an artist.

SC: I became an artist because I have al-
ways found the engagement with materials 
and the process of discovery that occurs in 
the making of objects visually and mentally 
alluring.

BC: There was just no other option. From 
a very young age I was captivated and 
obsessed with drawing and painting.

NP: I am an artist be default. My mother 
was one and my son, William Powhida, is 
fairly well known in New York City.

Any advice or thoughts you would like to 
share with college students?

SF: Stop partying so much, read about 
Paul McCarthy’s White Snow Installation, 
and enjoy school while you can. School 
should and can be a sanctuary, and you 
do not need drugs and alcohol to enjoy it. 
Nothing is free, and everything needs to be 
questioned. Absolutely every little thing… 
especially those which you are told.

KF: It is important to form connections 
with professionals in your field. It’s also 
important to realize that if you are choosing 
a career, like art, because you really love 
it, you will have to take the bad with the 
good. All these days of working hard and 
working through challenges lead to the suc-
cesses. Sometimes it’s hard to accept that 
something you enjoy can be so challenging. 

SC: The active engagement in the arts, 
whatever form, encourages students to 
experiment, think outside the box and 
develop their own voice. The development 
and encouragement of creative thinking 
expands all horizons.

BC: Hold tight to your childhood - good 
or bad - your work is going to depend on 
it somewhere down the line. Read, and 
make sure you read some difficult stuff. 
And knock your mentors off their pedestals 
because you can’t get to where you want 
to go if you don’t. Don’t worry, you can 
always place them back up there when the 
time comes.

NP: To make a living as an artist today is 
very difficult. It takes lots of versatility, 
networking and social skills, as well as 
hard work and long hours.

of, ‘Sean, I don’t know anything 
about making a scary movie.’ 
And Sean said, ‘Well, you were 
raised as a fundamentalist, just 
pull all the skeletons out of your 
closet.’” 
Sean Cunningham was a 
longtime friend and collaborator 
of Craven. Cunningham served 
as producer for “The Last House 
on the Left,” and later went on 
to create the “Friday the 13th” 
series. 
Craven has expressed publicly 
that he felt guilty about creating 
his first film “The Last House on 
the Left,” due to the backlash it 
received for its intensely crude 
content. “I think the important 
thing about staying creative and 
staying sharp and original is not 
to look back too much,” said 

Craven. “But I have felt over 
the years a definite progression 
or arc from feeling guilty about 
what I had done…feeling like 
I’d done something horrible ‘I’m 
a despicable person and I’m 
perverse’ and all these things, 
to a sense of the power and the 
necessity, in a sense, of hor-
ror films and dealing with dark 
material.”
The 1999 drama film “Music 
of my Heart,” was the only film 
directed by Craven that was not 
in the horror realm. Starring 
Meryl Streep, the movie was 
about a violinist who teaches 
music to inner-city children.
Craven’s lengthy career 
spanned over multiple decades, 
and he is often credited with the 
revitalization of the horror genre 
with his films. His latest work 
included serving as an executive 
producer on the television series 
adaptation of his film “Scream,” 
which premiered on MTV on 

June 30, 2015. The show’s sea-
son finale, which aired Sept. 1, 
was dedicated to Craven.
Although many of his most 
famous films have been made 
decades ago, they are still 
watched by fans today. “Night-
mare on Elm Street was one of 
the first horror movies I loved,” 
said University at Albany senior, 
Rahul Saxena.
Despite being discontent with 
his path at first, Craven was 
satisfied with the impact he had 
left. “[Nightmare] and Scream, 
I think, are the only two things 
that have become part of the 
global culture,” said Craven in 
an interview with EW. “I just sat 
there thinking, it’s amazing how 
deeply into the culture that film 
has penetrated.”
Wes Craven will certainly be 
a presence that is missed in film, 
but his movies and characters 
will undoubtedly permeate for 
decades to come.

SUMMER MOVIES

THE BEST AND BRIGHTEST OF 
SUMMER 2015

By THOMAS KIKA

For decades, summer has been 
the time of year when movie 
studios unleash their biggest re-
leases to compete for box office 
dominance.  And big is certainly 
the appropriate descriptor: big 
budgets, big stars, big successes, 
big flops, and of course, big 
popcorn.  As fun as this can all 
be, with every release aiming to 
provide the most entertainment 
for your $12+ ticket, whether 
anything is actually good can 
sometimes get lost in the shuffle.  
Luckily, while summer 2015 
had plenty of flashy and incoher-
ent mediocrity to go around with 
the likes of “Terminator Geni-
sys” and “Fantastic Four,” there 
were also a generous handful of 
gems for audiences to savor.  
The awesome hit early and hit 
hard this summer with the release 
of “Mad Max: Fury Road” on 
May 15.  Director George Miller 
returned to the post-apocalyptic 
franchise that he created way 
back in 1979 for a fourth install-
ment that does not miss a single 
step. “Fury Road” is one of the 
best films of the summer, and of 
the year, full-stop. It is a master 
class in many ways: it shows 
how wonderful real locations 
and practical stunts can still 
be, it manages to seamlessly 
blend near-constant action with 
strong storytelling and character 
development, and most impor-
tantly, it demonstrates how future 
fiction can send strong, relevant 
messages with its anti-patriarchal 
themes. These themes are given 
flesh with Imperator Furiosa, the 
film’s biggest breakout charac-
ter, brought to life with stunning 
intensity by Charlize Theron.  
There was some concern as to 
whether a film like “Fury Road,” 
with its R-rating and $150 mil-
lion budget, could be successful 
in a very PG13-friendly envi-
ronment.  Happily, its wildly 
positive word-of-mouth seems 
to have put butts in seats, as the 

film has made close to $375 
million worldwide.  Hopefully, 
Miller’s promised sequel, “Mad 
Max: The Wasteland,” will not 
be too far off. 
The trend of strong sequels 
to long-running franchises 
continued later on in July with 
“Mission: Impossible – Rogue 
Nation,” the fifth, and possibly 
the best, entry in Tom Cruise’s 
19-year-old espionage series.  
There is a concern with film 
franchises, especially ones like 
“Mission: Impossible,” that are 
old enough to vote. The concern 
is over whether or not a new 
installment has anything to offer 
over its predecessors.  “Rogue 
Nation” had the benefit of good 
faith left by the series’ fourth 
entry, Brad Bird’s “Ghost Pro-
tocol,” but it also had the tough 
task of living up to it, as many 
considered it the series’ high-wa-
ter mark at the time.  Despite that 
pressure, director Christopher 
McQuarrie (“Jack Reacher”) 
shows no self-doubt, handing in a 
muscular sequel with two-fists of 
thrills and twisty intrigue aplen-
ty, narrowly edging out Bird’s 
film as the best in the series.  
The set-pieces are spectacular, 
with a mind-boggling sequence 
of Cruise, dangling from an 
actual plane, confidently breezed 
through in the first 10 minutes.  
The characters and their interplay 
are the best they have ever been, 
with newcomers Rebecca Fergu-
son and Sean Harris deserving 
hefty praise for their work as 
the mysterious British agent Ilsa 
Faust and the unsettling villain 
Solomon Lane, respectively.  
It would be a pretty sad state 
if sequels were the only summer 
movies that delivered, leaving 
original concepts to whither and 
fade.  After getting caught up in 
their own case of sequel-mania 
in the past few years, animation 
powerhouse Pixar released “In-
side Out,” an original film which 
could have been considered 
successful had it only surpassed 

their disappointing recent out-
put, but instead surprised most 
everyone by being one of, if not 
the greatest thing the legendary 
studio has ever created. Pixar has 
always been celebrated for their 
emotional storytelling, and in 
“Inside Out” emotion is not just 
the goal of the story, it is literally 
the story as we follow the per-
sonified emotions of a young girl 
dealing with her family’s recent 
move. The relative normality of 
the young girl Riley’s situation is 
a strength here as it helps the au-
dience empathize with her plight. 
That is important, because empa-
thy is the other goal that “Inside 
Out” strives for.  It does not just 
want the viewer to empathize 
with the story, but it also seeks to 
teach them why trying to under-
stand each other has value in real 
life.  At key points, “Inside Out” 
zooms into the minds of other 
characters, revealing that they 
too have little emotional avatars 
guiding their decisions, helping 
them overcome insecurity, and 
trying to interpret the actions of 
others.  “Everybody is person,” 
says the film, “with concerns and 
goals that are not far off from 
your own”.  As Devin Faraci at 
“Birth.Movies.Death” opined, 
“Inside Out’ is a film that will 
“make you a better person.”
Of course, a lot more than 
studio-driven blockbusters come 
out in the summer. The indie 
scene often sees the release of 
many notable films during this 
time, and while they may exist 
outside of the traditional “sum-
mer movie” paradigm, there are a 
few from this year that deserve a 
spotlight. John Maclean’s “Slow 
West,” Bill Condon’s “Mr. 
Holmes,” Marielle Heller’s “The 
Diary of a Teenage Girl,” and 
Thomas Vinterberg’s “Far from 
the Madding Crowd” all came 
out this summer, and each of 
them is a beautiful, unique little 
gem that can stand head-and-
shoulders above the vast majority 
of major studio releases.

Jill Scott gave a thrilling concert 
at Brooklyn’s Kings Theater on 
Wednesday, July 22 as part of her 
summer tour to promote her new 
album “Woman,” which dropped 
on iTunes Friday, July 24. 
There was not an empty seat in 
the house that Wednesday night. 
Her opening act, BJ the Chicago 
Kid, performed covers of Stevie 
Wonder and Lionel Richie songs as 
well as a performance of “Studio” 
by Schoolboy Q, which he is fea-
tured on. Interesting enough, BJ the 
Chicago Kid once sang back up for 
Jill Scott. 
Jill Scott hasn’t put out new 
music since her fourth studio album 
“The Light of the Sun” dropped in 
2011.  
Jill Scott, or Jilly from Philly as 
she is sometimes called, released 
her first album “Who is Jill Scoot? 
Words and Sounds Vol. 1” back in 
2000. Since that time, she has won 
three Grammy awards and three 
Soul Train awards, among other 
nominations. All five of her albums 
have made it in the top five of either 
the U.S. Billboard 200 or U.S. Bill-
board Top R&B/ Hip-Hop Albums.

band with great acoustics and an 
electric voice, Jill Scott came out 
singing oldie but goodie, “What-
ever” from her second album, 
“Beautifully Human: Words and 
Sounds Vol. 2.” Once she emerged 
from backstage, the theater was 
standing room only. Her smile was 
contagious and radiant. 
After getting the crowd ex-
cited with some of her old songs, 
she started singing songs off her 
new album “Woman” which was 
scheduled to drop two days after 
Wednesday night’s concert. She 
gave the audience a taste of “Can’t 
Wait” and “Prepared”. Being the 
poetic artist that she is, she gave 
the audience the words to the song 
before she brought the band to play 
the background music. 
Her band and backup singer, The 
Pipes, took the already wonderful 
concert to the next level. Scott has 
an all-male band with keyboard, 
drums, guitar, trumpet and electric 
guitar to name a few. The Pipes is 

also an all-male trio. They have the 
smoothest voices and dance moves 
that any backup singers could have. 
They’re also Jill Scott’s personal 
hype men. 
The audience exploded when 
the band started playing the 
instrumental to “The Way.” They 
sang along with enthusiasm to the 
semi-slow song off Scott’s debut 
album. Fifteen years later, the song 
is still a hit. She continued the 
concert singing, “Gimmie”, “Crown 
Royal,” “Hate on Me,” “It’s Love,” 
“Golden,” “Slowly Surely,” “A 
Long Walk” and “Cross My Mind.” 
In the midst of this she was telling 
stories about her childhood and 
her love for music and her love for 
love and her love of her son, Jett. 
She was so comformtable with the 
audience that at one point she took 
off her shoes. 
Scott gave the audience two 
more songs off her new album, 
“You Don’t Know” which is a love 
ballad with a jazz feel to it and 
“Closure” a song about ending a 
relationship with someone she’s 
been with for years. While the band 
was playing, Scott left the stage and 
the audience was still cheering. The 
Pipes said, “Y’all want Miss Scott 
to come back?” and the audience 
erupted in cheers and applause. 
“If y’all want her to come back, 
when we say Jill, y’all say Scott.” 
After about three times of call and 
response, Jill Scott came back on 
stage and closed the concert with 
an operatic style song of “He Loves 
Me (Lyzel in E Flat).” After that 
performance the audience again 
erupted into loud cheers. 
Scott’s summer tour was to allow 
her one day at Kings Theater, but 
tickets sold out so fast that they 
added another day which was 
streamed on Yahoo. Scott’s tour 
started July, 13 in her home state 
of Pennsylvania and ended on 
August 28 in Phoenix, Arizona. Her 
new album, “Woman” has already 
reached the number one spot on 
Billboard’s Top R&B/ Hip Hop 
Albums.

Albany that pays men more 
than woman either. The College 
at Saint Rose pays male 
professors $14,000 more than 
females. Maria College has 
a $4,400 difference per year, 
and Albany Law School offers 
$15,000 more to professors who 
are male. Albany College of 
Pharmacy and Health Sciences 
pays male professors nearly 
$34,000 more than female 
professors annually. 
‘Professors’ is not the only 
job title showing a wage gap 
between the genders at UAlba-

nearly $10,000 more, assistant 
professors make an extra $4,000 
and lecturers make an additional 
$16,000 if they are male. 
While there were no statistics 
about staff members available 
at this site, a file made up  of all 
the faculty and staff members’ 
names, department, base salary, 
annual salary, and job title was 

made available by a request 
through the Freedom of Infor-
mation Law (FOIL). 
Of the four female and 12 
male supervising janitors, the 
base salaries averaged out to 
almost identical numbers. The 
women were paid $2.58 more 
per year than the men. The 
cleaners had a similar outcome 
with a slightly larger difference, 
with women earning about 
$946.09 more per year than 
men. 
Both of these numbers are 
rough estimates, as some names 
were not included due to uncer-

treatment because of 
its expectations of flying 
the drones on numerous 
occasions. Buyantuev 
said getting cleared by the 

FAA might take months, 
but they have the time, 
as their research isn’t 
due to begin until spring 
semester.
In the mean-
time, the profes-
sor is still teach-
ing courses in 
geography and 
ecology, as well 
as continuing his 
own education 
on UAS. One of 
his goals for the 
semester is to 
have a short-
ened course that 
would essential-
ly be an “intro 
to drones,” as he 
put it. He said it 
could be open 
to students in 
his discipline, as 
well as anyone 
enthused by the 
Precision Hawk, 
or even the autonomous 
multi-rotor drone that 
he said was due in next 

week.
Buyantuev isn’t work-
ing alone, though. His 
equipment will back re-
search done by Catherine 
T. Lawson, chair of the 
geography and planning 
department and director 
of the UAlbany Visual-
ization and Informatics 
Lab (AVAIL), who wants 
to look into how UAS can 
study severe weather and 
disaster relief.
From moving from 
Russia to 
China to the 
U.S. and 
receiving 
two 
doctorates 
along 
the way, 
Buyantuev 
has come to 
know a lot 
about the 
environment. 
When it 
comes to 
climate 

change, he takes the 
stance that pluralism isn’t 
constructive. 
“The facts are there,” 
he said.
And when it comes to 
his overall body of work, 
Buyantuev is proud. “It’s 
a technology and also a 
science, and a little bit of 
art,” he said of his most 
focused field, remote 
sensing. It seems the 
professor will have his 
masterpiece soon enough.

himself.
The inside, however, looks 
brand new, with tan tiled floors

lamb, painted on them.
The inside, however, looks

that match sponged-painted beige 
walls. The walls have stenciled 
animal shapes and names of 
exotic meats found on the menu, 
such as camel, armadillo, and 
lamb, painted on them.
The exotic burgers range in 
price anywhere from $15.00 to 
$30.00, and they come with bot-
tomless fries. The fries are the 
best I have ever had, and accord-

ing to Kahn, the best fries in the 
world. With each spice carefully 
balanced to match the perfect 
combination of seasonings and 
salts, every mouthful is better 
than the last. The sheer thought 
of them is just making my mouth 
water now. Don’t let the prices 
scare you away.
If you are not into the $30.00 
gourmet burgers or perhaps a 
little wary of the exotic animals, 
there are regular burgers on the 
menu for only $2.00 (add another 
dollar for cheese) that are just as 
tasty. All of Kahn’s burgers come 
topped with his special sauce, 
which is unbelievably delicious, 
but he wouldn’t give you the 
recipe even if you begged.
I ordered the 100 percent Kobe 
Beef burger, medium rare. The 
taste was incredible. I have never 
had a burger like it. One after 
another, each bite filled my mouth 
with an explosion of flavor like a 
river of juicy goodness gushing 

over my taste buds.
Kahn has had plenty of time 
to perfect his delectable recipes 
and exquisite formulas. Formerly 
a body-builder, Kahn went into 
the restaurant business when he 
was just 18 years old, starting as a 
cook in his home country of India. 
He moved to many countries 
throughout his life, working as 
either a cook or chef throughout 
his 42 years.
He’s lived in Pakistan, Turkey, 
Hong Kong, Dubai, America, 
Egypt, Sri Lanka, and Singapore, 
each time taking something out of 
the cooking traditions and using it 
to shape his own style of cooking. 
Singapore, he said, would have 
to be his favorite. A country so 
clean, as he claims, one can walk 
barefoot with dirty feet down the 
street, to the subway, and it would 
be like you just showered.
He said his culinary style is 
also influenced by Greek and 
Indian cooking. Curiously, he’s 

disgusted by Italian food. He said 
it involves too many tomatoes, 
which, according to him, were 
first used in India and weren’t 
introduced to Italy until 400 years 
ago.
Kahn isn’t one to base judg-
ments off of race or appearance. 
In fact, he stated that he went into 
the exotic meat business because 
of racial judgments and profiling. 
He told me a story, as my mouth 
was watering from my burger, 
about when he first opened a 
restaurant that didn’t specialize in 
exotic meats.
“When I first started as a head 
chef in America, when people 
saw my face they asked for 
chicken curry because I looked 
Indian,” Kahn explained. 
He said when he started selling 
exotic meats people no longer 
cared about his face but instead 
were so interested in the menu 
items. He also said that Indians 
who own Indian restaurants are 

just afraid to leave their comfort 
zones, and he said the same of 
Chinese-owned Chinese restau-
rants.
Kahn has a special license 
from the New York State Health 
Department in exotic foods, and 
sometimes the meats are taxed 
more than the price he actually 
serves them for, causing Dave to 
lose money on certain burgers. He 
believes it is all worth it, and so 
do I. So, if you are a college stu-
dent looking to have a sit-down 
meal and eat fantastic meats, 
I suggest you come to Dave’s 
Gourmet and Exotic Burgers. 
After all, it’s right down the 
street, and your money gets you 
much more than appetizing food. 
Kahn is a show in himself and 
will always welcome you into his 
restaurant with a hospitable smile 
and a sincere, “Hey, how are you 
doing my friend?!”

with two days in between 
we’re going to feel that 
much better.”
After they got possession 
of the ball, the Red Foxes 
came in hard with the 
attacks from the start of the 
game. UAlbany held off 
Marist’s attacks. UAlbany 
got their shot at the 36th 
minute when forward Kiana 
Rugar got the ball in the 
near side of the box. Rugar 
passed it to forward Mariah 
Williams who kicked the 
ball right inside the goal, 
giving UAlbany a 1-0 lead. 
The goal was Williams’ 

second of the season.
“They were all over us. 
We were really behind the 
game for the first 25 or 30 

minutes. It’s good that we found a way to 
come out of that spell one nail up. That’s 
not easy to do,” Bochette said. “I think that 
speaks to who we are and the grit were 
willing to show to find a way when you’re 
under pressure to still come out and score 
some goals.”
With less than 10 minutes left in the first 
half, UAlbany had a few attempts with 
corner kicks in the final minutes of the half, 
but did not get another shot in. UAlbany 
went into halftime leading 1-0.
“We went into halftime needing an 
adjustment so we made a little bit of a 
tactical shift here and there but really how 
it got better was the response from the 
players. It’s the second game in a row we 
came out of halftime and we responded 
brilliantly. In the second half we decided we 
wanted to be the team controlling the pace 
and we were. I think we were in good shape 
after that happened,” said Bochette.
Bochette was right. UAlbany came out 
strong the second half. There were some 

shots by Rugar and forward Allison Carhart 
that were saved but lead to corner kicks. 
UAlbany scored another goal in the 60th 
minute. Marist diverted the ball to the far 
side of the box. Forward Krista Fitzpatrick 
recovered the ball, passed it to forward 
Vivian Vega, who kicked the ball right into 
the net making the score 2-0 in favor of 
Great Danes.
“I think getting a goal before halftime 
was needed for us because we were put 
under a lot of pressure for most of the half. 
So it was good for us to go into halftime 
one nothing. And it was great for us to 
come out two nothing with a win against 
Marist. I thought we responded really well. 
It was really good to get the win and I think 
we’re headed in the right direction,” said 
Brennan.
After two straight home wins, UAlbany’s 
next game will be on Thursday, Sept. 10 
against Dartmouth at 5 p.m at Bob Ford 
Field to finish out a three game homestand.

Mariah Williams scored in 
UAlbany’s win over Marist. 

After Moo-
sah Khanat 
cleared up 
field on a 
Patriots set 
piece, with Afonso Pinheiro leading a 
4-on-3 counter-attack to the other end. The 
sophomore played classmate Jake Barros a 
bit too far, and Kraus called defenders off to 
thwart the charge.
The Danes did not let up, as a Mason foul 
set up a free kick 25 yards out. Service fell 
outside the Patriots box, but Khanat fired 
low and wide. Philip Persson found Pinhei-
ro for another Purple & Gold shot shortly 
after, but the teams remained scoreless.
The game continued to pick up pace, 
as Mason streaked down the left side to 
put a shot on goal, but Orologio made the 
save. The ensuing Patriots corner kick was 
cleared away.
After Gorrie served up a set piece on net, 
and the rebound rolled out to Khanat. The 
sophomore transfer sent a pass up from 30 
yards out, connecting with Clark for the 
duo’s first career points in the Purple & 
Gold in the 75th minute.
Persson was taken down in the box mo-
ments later, and Leo Melgar made good 
on a penalty kick in the 77th minute. The 
junior scored less than two minutes after 
Clark to give the Danes a 2-0 lead.

The Purple & Gold held defensively for 
the closing moments of the game, securing 
a 2-0 victory and its second consecutive 
shutout.
Carlos Clark and Moosah Khanat 
recorded their first career points in the vic-
tory, while Leo Melgar notched his second 
goal to lead the team this season. Orologio

UAlbany began their season with a meet at Colgate.

Heuser, 
last year’s 
NFHCA Na-
tional Player 
of the Year, 
concluded 
the 2014 season leading the NFHCA in 
points per game (3.0). The junior is the 
first player in history to win America East 
Midfielder of the Year in back to back 
seasons. She finished last year with a 
team-leading 29 goals and 11 assists for 69 
points, including four game winning goals. 
Heuser says that her team is, “trying to 
find their identity this year,” after having 
so much success last year as the underdog.  
She is confident that the Danes will 
be able to achieve their ultimate goal of 
becoming America East Champions by, 
“setting small goals,” and, “taking it one 
game at a time.” 
Heuser also noted that, while this year’s 
freshman class is exceptionally large, they 
are talented and, “integrating well into the 
team.” 
Six of the seven newcomers have expe-
rience in national tournaments.
Last year, UAlbany won 20 games en 
route to its fourth America East Title in as 
many years. The No. 7 Danes have already 
been able to build on their nationwide best 
14-game winning streak last year. 

This past weekend, the Great Danes 
earned 3-1 victories at both Miami of Ohio 
and Ohio State on the road to open the 
season.
Phil Sykes and his team have a difficult 
schedule this season featuring only seven 
home games.  They play No.3 Maryland 
on Friday September 11 in a rematch of 
the NCAA Second Round.
In that game, the Danes prevailed 2-1 
to become only the second-ever team to 
defeat Maryland at home in the NCAA 
Tournament. 
UAlbany will have to adjust to a new 
America East format this season, as five 
West Coast schools have been added to the 
conference. 
The West Division consists of Cal, 
Pacific, Stanford, and UC Davis. 
UAlbany, Maine, New Hampshire, 
UMass Lowell, and Vermont make up the 
East Division.  
Four teams from each division will be 
eligible for the NCAA tournament, with 
seeding determined by the results of each 
team playing each other twice.  
The Danes face No. 2 North Carolina 
in their home opener at Alumni Field 
Sunday Sept. 13 at 1 p.m. The America 
East Championship will also be hosted by 
UAlbany this fall.

Taylor found the end zone from 
21 yards out with 7:19 remaining 
until halftime to give the Bulls a 
17-7 lead. Taylor, an All-MAC 
second teamer a year ago, rushed 
for 104 yards on 17 carries includ-
ing two touchdowns. 
“(Taylor) is outstanding,” UAl-
bany head coach Greg Gattuso 
said. “We’re certainly not going to 
see anybody better. You’ve got to 
give him credit.”
Just 2:28 before the half, Jordan 
Johnson punched it in from a yard 
out to make it 24-7 Bulls at the 
half. 
With UAlbany opening the sec-
ond half with the football, Crook 
threw his second interception of 
the game to give the Bulls posses-
sion on the Danes’ 22. Crook tried 
hitting Brad Harris on a comeback 
route, but Boise Ross beat Harris 
back to the ball. 
The Bulls put the nail in the 
coffin with Taylor’s one-yard 
touchdown run to make it 31-7 
with 13:16 remaining. 
“I have to make better deci-
sions,” Crook said. “(I have to) 
put my team in better situations. It 
was unfortunate, but I have to be 
able to move on from that.”
While Crook started to struggle, 

Licata kept finding receivers for 
Buffalo. The senior from Wil-
liamsville, N.Y., connected with 
Jacob Martinez for a 20-yard 
touchdown pass with 9:08 left in 
the third quarter to make it 38-7, 
Buffalo. 
Licata finished the game 
20-for-26 for 246 yards and two 
touchdowns, while becoming 
the Bulls’ all-time leader in total 
touchdowns. 
“He’s a mature quarterback,” 
UAlbany senior linebacker Colin 
Cooper said. “He’s played a lot of 
ball.”
Cooper’s linebacking partner, 
and Great Danes captain, Michael 
Nicastro sustained a possible knee 
injury in the first half. 
“We lost the heart and soul of 
our defense,” Gattuso said. “That 
was a hard thing to overcome. We 
have to get some kids to step up. 
(Losing) Mike Nicastro was a big 
blow. That was a hard thing to 
overcome.” 
UAlbany found the end zone 
again when Elijah Ibitokun-Hanks 
found the end zone with a one-
yard run to make it 38-14 with 
11:48 in the fourth quarter. 
Ibitokun-Hanks’ touchdown 
was the lone highlight for the 
Great Danes’ running game. Ibi-
tokun-Hanks rushed for 74 yards 
on 11 carries, all in the second half 
of his first collegiate game. Elliot 
Croskey got the start and recorded 

just 32 yards on 13 carries. 
“Whether something is work-
ing, or something is not, I need 
to find the answer,” Crook said 
about the lack of big plays on the 
ground. “I wasn’t able to find an 
answer today.”
In the final four minutes of 
the game, Buffalo second-string 

quarterback Tony Daniel had a 
one-yard rushing touchdown, and 
Jacob Martinez had the Bulls’ first 
punt return touchdown since 2002, 
making it 51-14, Bulls. 
Despite the large margin of vic-
tory, the Danes did acknowledge 
there were some positives to take 
away from the game. However, 

business needed to shift to next 
Saturday against Rhode Island in 
the Danes’ home opener at Bob 
Ford Field. 
“This is behind us right now,” 
Cooper said. “We’re going to 
come in tomorrow, watch what we 
did, improve off it, and get ready 
for Rhode Island.”

Two goals in less than two 
minutes gave University at Albany 
men’s soccer (2-1-0) its second-
consecutive win on Saturday night, 
beating George Mason (1-2-0) 2-0 in 
Fairfax. Carlos Clark and Leo Mel-
gar tallied the goals for the Danes.
“Tonight was a very solid perfor-
mance on the road,” said head coach 
Trevor Gorman. “George Mason is a 

good team, and put us under pressure 
early. I thought once we found our 
rhythm we were very good, and kept 
getting better.”
UAlbany was on the defensive 
early, as two Mason corner kicks in 
the first four minutes led to shots. 
Eric Orologio in his second start of 
the season made one quick save to 
avoid a 1-0 hole.

The Great Danes and Patriots 
traded offside calls mid-way through 
the half. The momentum swung in 
UAlbany’s favor in the 22nd minute, 
as Nico Solabarrieta had a shot saved 
by Steffan Kraus.
Both teams continued to be ag-
gressive through the midfield, and 
Mason had a look on net that hit the 
post. UAlbany responded with its 

own flick on goal with the counter-
attack, as Carlos Clark put a header 
towards the right side of the goal, 
forcing a diving save from Kraus.
The Purple & Gold kicked off the 
second half with some key take-
aways in their own end, but couldn’t 
connect to the forward line. The 
Danes won the time-of-possession 
battle through the midfield without 

putting any shots on goal through the 
first 10 minutes.
Mason managed a look from the 
top of the 18 in the 56th minute, 
but senior co-captain Martin Gorrie 
slid over to block the attempt. Keith 
Traut intercepted another Mason shot 
moments later to keep the score tied 
at 0-0.

After becoming the first University at 
Albany team to reach the national Final 
Four in 2014, UAlbany field hockey is de-
termined to make another deep postseason 
run. The Danes were ranked No.7 by the 
National Field Hockey Coaches Association 
(NFHCA) in their first poll, which is their 
highest all-time preseason ranking.
UAlbany coach Phil Sykes boasts an 
impressive lineup of both returning players 
and freshman. Goalkeeper Maxi Primus, 

who led the nation with a goals against 
average of 1.03, is back in the crease. 
Primus and returners Jaclyn Hibbs and Fiori 
Van Risjwijk anchor a strong back line that 
held opponents scoreless in 10 games last 
season.    
Offensively, the Danes are led by return-
ers Van Risjwijk, Laura Page, and Paula 
Heuser.  The trio led the Danes in points 
last season, and all three were selected for 
both NFHCA All-Region and America East 
First Team.

The Great Danes’ new era began 
with a touchdown, but Buffalo 
stormed back with 38 unanswered 
points en route to a 51-14 vic-
tory on Saturday afternoon at UB 
Stadium. 
“We had 38 unanswered 
(points),” University at Albany 
sophomore wide receiver Josh 
Gontarek said. “You’ve just got 
to keep fighting throughout the 
game.”
Penn State transfer quarterback 
DJ Crook marched the Danes 82 

yards on 14 plays on the Great 
Danes’ opening drive, capped 
with a four-yard touchdown pass 
to Gontarek. The Danes held a 
7-0 lead with 6:27 left in the first 
quarter. 
“It felt good (to score on the 
opening drive),” Crook said. “I 
wish it continued. We’ve got to go 
through this adversity and come 
back strong next week.”
Crook was 5-for-7 passing for 
57 yards, while converting all four 
of the Danes’ third down chances 
on the first drive. For the remain-
der of the game, Crook matched 

his first drive passing yard totals 
on 6-for-15 passing. 
Buffalo tied the game on the 
next drive with an eight-play, 60-
yard touchdown drive, ending with 
a nine-yard touchdown pass from 
Joe Licata to Marcus McGill with 
3:29 left in the first quarter.
That would lead to 31 more 
unanswered points for the Bulls 
as Adam Mitcheson converted his 
first career field goal attempt from 
40 yards out to make it 10-7 early 
in the second quarter.

UAlbany had plenty to celebrate at the end of last season, and they will need to 
work just as hard this year to accomplish what they did in 2014.

With only one day in 
between their first two home 
games, the University at 
Albany women’s soccer team 
came in more than prepared 
and defeated Marist College 
2-0 win on Friday night, Sept. 
4 at Bob Ford Field. 
“I feel like we were very 
prepared. We took it easy 
yesterday, we had a good short 
practice and today we had a 
nice walk through and prepared 
for Marist. We came in, we 
fought hard and got the win,” 
said goalkeeper Alana Bren-
nan. 
Brennan made six saves in 
goal and the back line made 
two team saves. 
“We fought really hard but 
in the beginning of the game it 
took us a while to get adjusted 
to their pressure. They were 
coming at us really hard and 
they had a couple opportuni-
ties but we stopped them,” said 
Brennan.
UAlbany acting head coach, 
Nick Bochette, feels thrilled 
about the game results.
“We won a game in which 
we didn’t play well for a large 
portion of it. You can never be 
upset with a win. Good teams 
can find a way to persevere 
even when they’re not at their 
top level,” said Bochette. 
He will admit though that it 
has been difficult. This early 
part of the year is a building 
time for the team. 
“We’re building fitness. 
We’re developing tactics that 
we’re going to use later in the 
season in conference play. 
Short rest is never fun but it’s 
also good for us to play when 
we’re not feeling great. It’s 
good for us to play when we’re 
a little sore and a little slower 
because then we have to figure 
things out differently,” said 
Bochette. “It’s not easy to do 
but when we do go on the road
