The life-saving overdose 
antidote naloxone is 
becoming more available 
throughout New York, 
including on SUNY 
campuses, through 
programs that help safety 
officials, students and 
others combat and prevent 
opioid-related emergencies.  
Earlier this month, a 
press release issued by 
Gov. Andrew Cuomo 
announced that independent 
pharmacies throughout the 
state can now sell naloxone, 
also known by its brand 
name Narcan, to customers 
without a prescription. 
Naloxone is a nasally 
administered antidote that 
blocks the effects of opioids 
on the brain, reversing the 
deadly consequences of an 
overdose. The increased 
availability of the antidote 
comes amid the spike in 
opioid related overdoses 
throughout the nation. 
In 2014, the governor 
signed a package of 
legislation aimed at 
improving treatment of 
opioid abuse, strengthening 
illegal distribution 
penalties, ensuring 
proper naloxone use and 
expanding public awareness 
campaigns. The signing 
of this legislation led 
both SUNY and CUNY 
campuses to “promote the 
Combat Heroin campaign 
on college campuses and 
train campus police and 
emergency personnel on the 
use of naloxone,” according 
to a press release from the 

Cuomo administration.  
Despite the national 
trend of opioid overdoses, 
Five Quad, the volunteer 
ambulance service that 
serves the University at 
Albany, has not seen any 
increase in opioid related 
emergencies or overdoses 
on the UAlbany campus, 
according to Director of 
Operations Noah Pilnik. 
Since 2014, UAlbany 
police and Five Quad have 
been trained and equipped 
for the use of naloxone in 
opioid related emergencies 
and both support the use of 
the drug.
“I think naloxone can 
be a great tool for when 
law enforcement responds 
before EMS,” said UPD Lt. 
Kevin Krosky. 
UAlbany has adopted the 
Good Samaritan 911 law, a 
law that protects individuals 
from prosecution for drug 
possession if they contact 
authorities in response to 
a drug or alcohol related 
overdose or emergency. It 
was introduced by Cuomo 
is September 2011.
Opiates include 
hydrocodone, oxycodone, 
morphine, heroin and 
opium. In 2011, 4.2 
million Americans above 
the age of 12 admitted to 
using heroin once in their 
life, and over 2.5 million 
Americans suffered from an 
opioid addiction in 2012, 
according to the National 
Institute on Drug Abuse. 
“The rates of 
opioid use are low 
but the consequences,

Reports of sexual assault on the University 
at Albany campus hit 150 in 2015 - a 200 
percent increase from the previous year, 
according to Chantelle Cleary, UAlbany’s 
Title IX Coordinator. 
UAlbany is taking a different approach 
from other schools, embracing the rising 
numbers. 
 “I know it sounds crazy to say, but 
we want reports to go up,” said Cleary. 
“We know it is happening and if it’s not 
being reported to us, we are not getting 
services to these people who have had these 
experiences.”
The former prosecutor for the Assistant 
District Attorney in Albany said national 
statistics indicate that one in four women 
are sexually assaulted on college campuses. 
UAlbany has an undergraduate student body 
of roughly 17,000 with an almost even male 
to female ratio. This means that there should 
be roughly 2,100 reports of sexual assault 
reported to the university each year. 
Cleary attributes the 200 percent increase 
in reports to the student body’s awareness 
of the resources available to them and 
recognizes that this is a great start. However, 
she also acknowledges that the number is 
much lower than expected so there is still 
much to be done. 
In 2014, President Robert J. Jones 
opened up the Advocacy Center for Sexual 
Violence with Carol Stenger as the director. 

Currently, UAlbany is the only school in the 
SUNY system with its own sexual violence 
resource center. The following year he hired 
Cleary as the university’s full-time Title IX 
Coordinator, and in March 2016 he added a 
second full-time Title IX Coordinator, Tricia 
George. 
The main purpose behind the center, which 
Stenger refers to as a “one-stop shop,” is to 
give victims of sexual assault a chance to 
be heard even if they choose not to press 
charges, along with providing any resources 
they may need. 
“The very first thing we are going to 
offer you is a good listening to,” Stenger 
said. “You just had someone take away 
your decision making, they’ve decided what 
you’re going to do with your body and with 
your space. We want to give you that control 
back, we don’t want to take it away from you 
and say this is what we’re going to do.”
Unlike the Title IX office, the Advocacy 
Center is completely confidential, so Stenger 
is only required to report the date, time and 
location of the attacks to the university unless 
the victim chooses to pursue an investigation. 
In the event that the student does come 
forward, Stenger will inform Cleary, whose 
job it is to then determine if the victim wants 
the university to conduct an administrative 
investigation, the police to conduct an 
investigation, both or neither. The purpose of 
the administrative investigation is to decide if 
any UAlbany policies have been violated. 
“When I reach out to a student after 

receiving a report, my mission 
is to ensure that they are aware 
of all of their options so that 
they can make an informed 
decision… and they’re in the 
driver’s seat,” Cleary said. 
For each incident, Cleary and 
George meet with the Sexual 
Misconduct and Response 
Team, SMART, to determine 
what is best for the campus 
community as a whole, but they 
also do their best to honor the 
victim’s request.
According to Cleary, the 
main driving force behind the 
university’s approach to report 
sexual assaults has been Jones, 
who “has been not only fully 
committed, but a leader on this.”  
Stenger also noted Jones’ 
and the university’s collective 
support, hoping this will make 
students more likely to come 
forward. 
“The university would not 
be funding a place like this if 
they wanted to shove this stuff 
under the rug,” she said. “Having 
a stand-alone agency says 
something about the university’s approach 
which I hope would also make people more 
comfortable.”
To confidentially report an incident 
of sexual violence or to seek support, the 

Advocacy Center for Sexual Violence is open 
from 8:30 a.m. to 5 p.m. Monday through 
Friday, and can be found in Indian Quad’s 
Seneca Hall basement. To file a report of 
sexual conduct to the university, Chantelle 
Cleary can be contacted at 518-956-8168.

Albany to get more handicap-friendly

By MILO VOTAVA
 
Changes may be coming 
to the University at Albany’s 
Disability Resource Center after 
the city of Albany announced a 
collaboration with the Northeast 
Americans with Disabilities Act 
(NE ADA) Center to make the 

city more accessible to disabled 
citizens.
Although the collaboration is 
not geared towards the university, 
many of the services that the 
NE ADA provides are already 
covered on the UAlbany campus 
by the DRC.
 In addition to the ramps 

and automatic door 
openers on campus, 
the university website 
is equipped with 
button-press and mouse 
navigation, making 
the site accessible 
to visually impaired 
students. Videos on 
the site are also fully 
captioned for those who 
are hearing impaired. 
The DRC is responsible 
for the upkeep of all of 
these tools.
The partnership 
between Albany and 
the NE ADA will 
mostly help Albany 
businesses. The NE 
ADA will help them 
make their websites and 
physical stores more 
accessible. 
Places such as parks 
and crosswalks are 
also expected to receive some 
changes. While the ADA is not 
an enforcement or advocacy 
group, it still has the ability 
to help Albany residents and 
students access their city better.

Over the course of the next six 
years, the School of Public Health at 
the University at Albany will receive 
$700,000 to aid the Alzheimer’s 
Disease Program, which is sponsored 
by the New York State Department of 
Health. 
This is part of Gov. Andrew 

Cuomo’s $67.5 million grant program, 
Alzheimer’s Disease Caregiver Support 
Initiative, which was announced earlier 
this year. It follows the $25 million 
plan that was enacted by the NYSDOH 
last year to support individuals 
with Alzheimer’s disease and other 
dementias, as well as their caregivers. 
UAlbany plans to work closely with 
the NYSDOH in coordinating an in-
depth evaluation of the initiative. The 

evaluation, currently in its first year, 
is expected to be complete in its sixth 
year.
Alzheimer’s disease is a large public 
health issue for the state. Approximately 
380,000 people in New York are living 
with Alzheimer’s disease and other 
dementias, according to the Alzheimer’s 
Association. By the year 2025, that

including potential death, are very 
high,” said Dolores Cimini, the 
assistant director of Counseling 
Services at UAlbany. “That’s why 
we need Narcan, because it’s life-
saving.” 
In the spring of 2014, UPD 
held a training session for 
university professionals to 
recognize the signs of opioid 
abuse. By the fall of 2016, 
both counseling staff and 
members of Middle Earth 
Peer Assistance Program, an 
on-campus peer based support 
program, will be trained on 
how to administer naloxone, 
Cimini said. 
Although naloxone 
receives widespread 
support from legislators 
and healthcare providers, 

it has been met with 
opposition. Some feel that 
this distribution may provide 
individuals with a proverbial 
“license to use,” according 
to a journal published for the 
American Nurses Association. 
UAlbany however, has 
not met any opposition, and 
is working to make naloxone 
and related opioid-use 
prevention programs available 
on campus. Health officials 
urge students to familiarize 
themselves with the Good 
Samaritan 911 policies.
“The existence of Good 
Samaritan policies on college 
campuses and in states offer 
the opportunity for students 
and ordinary citizens to 
seek lifesaving assistance 
for others,” Cimini said. 
“Such policies allow us to 
be empowered and active 
bystanders.” 

number is projected to increase 
to 460,000. The disease takes a 
mental, physical, emotional and 
economic toll on not only those 
with Alzheimer’s, but on their 
family members and caregivers as 
well.  
“Caregivers are poorly paid and 
often feel restricted,” said Darla 
Starson, a registered nurse and the 
branch manager of Visiting Nurses 
Home Care. “The initiative should 
help caregivers feel respected 
and serve as an incentive to make 
others want to move into the 
caregiver field.”
Some of the goals the initiative 
aims to meet include providing 
additional caregiver support 
systems across the state and 
expanding evidence-based 

interventions offered by the 
Alzheimer’s Disease Centers 
of Excellence and Alzheimer’s 
Caregiver Assistance Programs. 
 According to Mary Gallant, 
a dean in the School of Public 
Health, the school will be 
collecting information from all 
organizations that are funded by the 
initiative to better understand who 
is being reached by the evidence-
based services in place. The School 
of Public Health will be reviewing 
surveys and interviews to help the 
state determine how to best support 
organizations in the future.
This evaluation will also look 
at the effects of support services 
on caregivers. This includes stress 
and health burdens, any potential 
to reduce avoidable emergency 
department visits, and whether 
the initiative delays nursing 
home placement. The provision 
of recommended screenings to 
determine an earlier diagnosis will 

be one of the outcomes assessed. 
“We’re allowing New York 
State to work at a much greater 
level than before,” Gallant said. 
“We’re hoping that New York 
can be a model to providing 
comprehensive support and 
demonstrate its experiences so the 
results inform future practices and 
policies.”
Along with Gallant, the students 
and faculty at the School of Public 
Health will analyze the data and 
then publish their results. This will 
allow students to gain real-world 
experience in program-evaluation 
by looking at various types of data 
and the public health implications 
of Alzheimer’s disease. Although 
the school is now an independent 
campus with full-time faculty, it 
frequently collaborates with the 
NYSDOH from an academic angle 
to address various public health 
problems in New York.

P

rison regulations have been a 
controversial issue for years, 
especially since the recent spike 
in incarcerations. With Clinton 
Correctional Facility’s prison escape 
scandal last summer and recent events 
involving prison violence, the quality of 
prison regulations have been brought into 
question. 
   This is an issue that continues to grab 
headlines today. At a Georgia prison 
there were claims of prison violence and 
assaults taking place just a few weeks ago: 
An 18-year-old inmate was assaulted and 
humiliated by other inmates. 
   However, this systemic issue pervades 
in more places than just America. A viral 
video of a brutal attack on an inmate in a 
Brixton prison in London recently made 
the news.
   According to Zeehhan Aleem of Policy 
Mic, there has been more than a 400 
percent increase in prisoner incarceration 

from 1980 to the present day.
   To put it more clearly, according 
to Aleem, “the population of those in 
prison would be the fourth largest city in 
America.” There are almost three million 
people incarcerated in the United States, 
and more than 3,000 of those prisoners 
have no chance of parole for nonviolent 
crimes. 
   More than 75 percent of prisoners overall 
are likely to be rearrested and brought 
back into prisons. Much of Democratic 
presidential candidate Bernie Sanders’ 
focus recently has been to reduce U.S. 
prison incarcerations. 
   Sanders’ other main focus, regarding the 
prison and justice system, is to end racial 
segregation when incarcerating individuals. 
   “Today a male African-American baby 
born today stands a one-in-four chance of 
ending up in jail… So what we have to do 
is the radical reform of a broken criminal 
justice system,” Sanders said. 

   The broken justice system is evident 
since 40 of the 50 states spend more 
money on prison systems than they do on 
education systems. Even so, according to 
Aleem, more than 17 states’ prisons are 
filled beyond capacity. 
   The knowledge of ongoing prison 
violence isn’t new. In fact, there have been 
several movements and petitions in hopes 
of obtaining “restorative justice,” as many 
people believe it is a much better approach 
in creating a better justice and incarceration 
system.
   Three issues must be dealt with to 
correct the flawed incarceration system. 
Considering that more than 60 percent 
of inmates are in prison for drug related 
crimes, it should, therefore, be changed to a 
public health concern rather than a criminal 
concern. 
   To avoid similar attacks in the prison, 
such as the crimes in the Brixton and 
Georgia prisons, it is important to separate 

violent offenders from the nonviolent 
offenders. Mixing all kinds of inmates, 
from violent and nonviolent crimes, 
can cause an overwhelming amount of 
emotions that result in further violence. 
   Comedian Jeff Ross visited Brazos 
County Jail to talk with prisoners and 
prison guards. From that visit, he realized 
a lot of the things Brazos County Jail is 
doing right. One of the aspects that the 
jail must be commemorated for is their 
system of rehabilitation. If a prisoner is 
on his or her best behavior, then they are 
given rewards such as more calls home, 
allowance of personal property, more 
leniency with guard supervision and more 
access to rooms with televisions and 
Internet access. Such a system of inmate 
privileges is preparation for good behavior 
and has the potential to rehabilitate those 
who are incarcerated for long periods of 
time.

WHAT PRISON REGULATIONS?

REFORM

Some prisons overlook offenses including violence and assault between the prisoners, which sometimes lead to death or injury, calling into question the regulations set

T

he power of social media has dwindled physical, 
intimate communication and, more precisely, love. 

    

It’s convenient nowadays to contact someone 
through Facebook Messenger or text messages, but 
that limits seeing each other’s presence. 
   With the rapid rise of technology, keyboard 
shortcuts and abbreviations, handwritten letters and 
postcards have become more of a foreign concept. The 
generic Times New Roman or Cambria typeface has 
replaced the distinct, nonchalant cursive letter people 
once wrote. I often think about letters and how powerful 
they are nowadays. The thought comes at spontaneous 
moments. 
   Sometimes it’s nice to receive a handwritten letter from 
your family, friend or loved one rather than a typed one. 
It’s more personal. 
   It’s possible to see where the person messed up, the 
occasional ink smudges throughout the paper from their 
hands when writing the letter, the way the person wrote 
certain letters and words, and it can be kept. The beauty 
is captured in the written craft in a much more personable 
way. 
   Just a few months ago when I was in Japan my 
grandmother pulled out my grandfather’s letter to his 
parents from when he was around my age. There were 
about five sheets of paper, neatly written in Japanese, each 
character as graceful as ever. My grandmother read a few 
sentences aloud for me, mainly about how he was doing 
fine in college and how he aimed to study well. 
   Even though these letters weren’t directed to me, I still 

felt close to him. I imagined him at the time on his desk 
under the dim light, writing each kanji character with 
meticulous care. 
   Granted, it’s so much more convenient to use social 
media to contact people, but I often wonder what it would 
be like if we didn’t have social media. The millennial 
generation lives in the era of online communication. 
    When I was younger, back when we had word count 
limits for texts, I still remember that my mother’s friend 
had sent me handwritten fax messages with a small smiley 
face at the bottom. 
    Without Facebook Messenger, unlimited text messaging 
and Skype, among other communication methods, would 
we treat each message more carefully? Would we think 
about what to write a bit more? Would our handwriting get 
better? 
   Love was probably more powerful in the old days. 

   

There was neither Skype nor Snapchat so people couldn’t 
see each other’s faces, there was no text so people couldn’t 
communicate often, there was no Facebook so people 
couldn’t see each other’s sweetheart’s updates. 
   There was the phone, but sometimes it wasn’t enough. 
When seeing each other for the first time in months or even 
years, imagine how powerful and joyful a couple must be. 
   What comes to mind is Miss Breed. Clara Estelle Breed 
was a librarian at the San Diego Public Library from 1929 
to 1945, the era of the Japanese-American Internment. She 
was a lovable mentor for all the children who came to the 
library, including the Japanese-Americans. 
    Yet when she found out that they were required to 
be sent out to desolate concentration camps, she was 
outraged, and gave many of them stamped and addressed 

postcards on the day of their departure, encouraging them 
to write their experiences. More than 250 vivid and clearly 
written letters came. Today, most of them are preserved at 
the Japanese American National Museum in Los Angeles. 
   Of course I will continue to use Messenger or text 
messaging whenever contacting friends and family, but 
at times, it’s ideal to send a few handwritten letters as it 
allows us to see one another in a whole different, personal 
perspective. No one person has the same handwriting as 
anyone else. 
    Write on.

Siitting down and writing a letter can take on more 
meaning than sending out a text message or a tweet.

WELCOME
TO THE  
LARGEST PUBLIC 
COLLEGE OF  
TECHNOLOGY  
IN THE  
NORTHEAST

   The college’s online homepage 
explains that a “simulation is a widely 
used teaching technique in which 
students play specified roles in simulated 
real world situations. For example, in a 
simulation of a hurricane event, students 
could play the role of emergency 
managers and policy makers during 
the preparation, response, and recovery 
phases of the storm.”
   In just about a year since its 
introduction to the campus, the college 
has been taking firm actions to teach 
students how to act in cases like 
Hurricane Sandy’s vicious attack on New 
Jersey. I suppose with super storms like 
that now making their way to the Upper 
East Coast, it would be in students’ best 
interests to be prepared for a natural 
disaster of any kind.
   This course is designed to, at first, 
teach students about how to react in 
natural disaster situations and then give 
them hands-on training at a separate 
location. 
   According to the SUNY blog, “[Gov. 
Andrew Cuomo] has committed $15 
million to establish this first-in-the-
nation security college.”
   The money is now being used to 
allow students to indulge in first-hand 
knowledge and actual experiences with 

natural disasters 
as well as 
cybersecurity 
threats that 
they would not 
have ordinarily 
had. It is fairly 
interesting to 
know that this 
school is fostering such a program. 
   The only concern that I have is how 
much money the university is investing 
in this program. It teaches students how 
to act in the case of a natural disaster, 
yet in this region we don’t have to deal 
with many hurricanes, or disasters like 
tornadoes or earthquakes. 
   I realize that it shouldn’t be the case 
that someone would have to experience 
a tragedy of that caliber in order to learn 
how to respond in these cases. But, it 
seems a bit much to choose UAlbany as 
the “guinea pig” for this kind of program.
   “I’m no expert, but it sounds like it 
would be a good idea because if we have 
programs built to teach students about 
emergency preparedness, it only makes 
sense to have a course that simulates 
emergency situations where they can 
make practical use of their knowledge,” 
said UAlbany student Michaela Czerkies, 
22.
   Aside from my general concerns about 
where finances are going, the program 
does seem to be essential to the younger 
generation. Especially in cases like 
Hurricane Sandy, a storm that became 
more daunting than anyone would have 
assumed, through this program people 
would know how to handle themselves. 

   The SUNY blog also wrote, “This 
is the first step in creating a more 
knowledgeable society that is capable of 
combating the growing threats that our 
country faces.”
   I question if $15 million is sufficient 
for this program and how effective it 
actually will be. I am not certain that 
a simulation of natural disasters will 

accurately portray what a student will 
experience during a tornado situation. 
   I question whether these students are 
actually learning quality information 
from this program, especially 
information that will teach them what 
they need to know, and to be ready, when 
the time calls for it.

A 

new four-week “simulation” course was 
introduced for University at Albany 
students, taking the College of Emergency 
Preparedness, Homeland Security and 
Cybersecurity to the next level.

LOCAL CONCERT
GIMMIE LOVE, CARLY RAE JEPSEN

By DIEGO CAGARA

Illuminated smartphones and cameras were 
held up by frenzied tweens and teenagers who 
were eagerly waiting for the Canadian singer and 
songwriter to come onstage. It was evident that 
these fans did not care how loud, boisterous or 
excited they were. 
When Carly Rae Jepsen walked onstage with 
her bandmates to greet the audience, grinning 
with gratitude from the uproarious applause, 
cheers and the occasional “Slay me, Carly!”, she 
did not need a pretentious or theatrical entrance, 
humbly advancing to her microphone stand 
with glee. Her appearance was further hyped by 
opening acts Cardiknox and Fairground Saints. 
Jepsen visited the Upstate Concert Hall on 
March 22 in Clifton Park as part of her “Gimmie 
Love Tour,” promoting her third studio album 
“Emotion” which came out late last summer. She 
sported a mustard yellow blazer, matching yellow 
dress pants, a black shirt with faint white stripes, 
a simple necklace and black-and-white thick 
soled shoes. 
With her rebellious black bob and post-
modern sense of style, this petite 30-year-old 
displayed impressive vocals and frequently 
interacted with her fans, dropping down to take 
selfies, beckoning people to sing some lyrics by 
presenting her mic to their enthusiastic faces, and 
winking at others.
Opening her concert with “Run Away with 
Me,” the album’s saxophone-infused power pop 
second single, she invited her fans to forget about 
their troubles and enjoy the night, a theme she 
continued with “Making the Most of the Night” 
and “Good Time,” her 2012 top 10 summer hit 
with electronica group Owl City. 
Her album-namesake song, “Emotion,” further 
showcased Jepsen’s quirky disposition, while 
her guitarists and drummers helped to elevate 
the song’s pop production. As she continued 
performing other numbers like “I Didn’t Just 
Come Here to Dance,” “Boy Problems” and 
“Love Again” which never ceased to get her fans 
singing along, even if off-key, a highlight was 
“This Kiss” which exuded the appropriate amount 
of cheesiness and romance. As she stood to the 

side, two of her male guitarists playfully shared 
a quick and sweet kiss at center stage, eliciting 
an instant plethora of sharp screams, squeals and 
supportive applause. The slower, sultry ballad, 
“All That,” was acclaimed for its 1980s feel and 
aptly diverted from the largely upbeat set list.
Jepsen’s personal side emerged as she told 
an anecdote of a past relationship with “When I 
Needed You,” reminding her audience that they 
should not change for anyone else. Her message 
was clear with its lyrics “Sometimes I wish that 
I could change/But not for me, for you/So we 
could be together, forever/But I know, I know 
that I won’t change for you/’Cause where were 
you for me/When I needed someone?” 
Despite some poignant and darker lyrics, 
she bounced back with her signature optimism 
and positive nature with “Gimmie Love,” its 
pulsating bass and overall synth-pop melody 
breathing new life to the night. Remarking to the 
eager audience, she sang that “when I’m close 
to you, we blend into my favourite colour,” 
gesturing everyone to swing their arms up high 
and revel in how music united them all that one 
night. 
Her compact appearance and limited 
dance moves were overlooked because of her 
remarkable voice, which told her fans that she 
was confident she didn’t need to rely solely on 
“Call Me Maybe” to sustain her musical career. 
Speaking of which, “Call Me Maybe” 
obviously garnered the loudest response of the 
night as everyone knew the lyrics of the song 
that invaded 2012. 
Concluding the hour-and-a-half concert with 
the teasing and witty single, “I Really Like 
You,” Jepsen placed a hand over her chest, 
beaming as her fans cheered and iPhones thrust 
up to film her simply exit the stage. 
With no elaborate dance routines or Lady 
Gaga-esque theatrics one would expect at a 
pop concert, Jepsen’s girl-next-door attitude, 
relatively short build and only one wardrobe 
change indeed fashioned a sense of intimacy.
Perhaps her “Gimme Love Tour” was not 
only about promoting her junior album. It gave 
her fans a private show, its nature heartwarming 
enough to liven their nights up. 

DANCE
Team “Madd Shott” 
makes UAlbany debut

By KARISHMA PERSAUD

The University at Albany’s Jamaican 
Student Association (JAMSA) hit a 
huge milestone on Friday, April 1 when 
their first dancehall team, “Madd Shott,” 
performed for JAMSA’s sixth annual 
Dancehall show event.
More than 100 students filled up 
Lecture Center 18 as DJ Vibez kept a 
hair-raising atmosphere from the moment 
students walked in and found their seats 
to when the show ended.  
The event kicked off with Jamaican 
comedian, “Prince Marni,” who flew 
in from Ft. Lauderdale, Florida to host 
the event. For those who are unaware 
of “Prince Marni,” he’s widely known 
throughout the Caribbean community for 
his short-comedy videos on Instagram 
that mostly pertain to the daily lives of 
Caribbeans. 
“I love it man, it’s my first time 
hosting a college event and I had a great 
experience tonight. The place full ah 
talent, meh really wan come back again,” 
Prince Marni said. 
Dancehall is a style of dance music that 
originated in Jamaica and derived from 
reggae. Team “Madd Shott” made their 
debut, opening the show in black T-shirts 
with a Jamaican flag on each shoulder. 
Following team “Madd Shott,” team 
“Under Construction,” dressed in all 
black, showed off their wicked dancehall 
moves. Team “Onyx,” dressed in red 
crop-tops and shorts, performed mostly 
hip-hop songs with one dancehall song. 
One fascinating thing about dancehall 
is the ability to choreograph it into other 
genres of music because of its flexibility 
in its moves. The last team, “VXR,” 
showed creativity in their dancing when 
they dispersed into the audience as a part 

of their routine and danced their way to 
the stage. 
According to the president of JAMSA, 
Khadisha Smikle, the idea of creating 
team “Madd Shott” happened in the fall 
of 2015. Smikle was always inspired by 
the African Student Association’s dance 
team, “Umoja,” and always had a big 
vision for something “new and different” 
in JAMSA. 
During an E-board meeting, Secretary 
Vanessa Jean suggested that JAMSA 
should create their own dancehall team so 
the board members made it happen. Once 
JAMSA finished their original plans for 
fall 2015, they began developing “Madd 
Shott” during the following spring. With 
the hard work of Romario McDowell, 
“Madd Shott’s” instructor and founder, as 
well as JAMSA’s board members, they 
gathered their most talented dancers to 
perform in this year’s Dancehall show. 
“I wanted this year to be big and I feel 
like me, along my e-board members have 
accomplished that so I am very proud,” 
Smikle said. 
After the teams put on a thrilling show, 
students in the audience were welcomed 
on stage to show off their own unique 
dancehall moves with Prince Marni. The 
event ended with a short recognition for 
each of the board members who were 
commenwded with flowers for their hard 
work in keeping JAMSA together and 
successful. 
JAMSA’s dancehall show created a 
lively atmosphere and “Madd Shott” 
proved itself to live up to Smikle’s vision. 
Just when everyone thought the festivities 
were over for the night, it continued in the 
Campus Center Ballroom where everyone 
had a chance to show off their own 
dancehall moves.

Sally Field strikes back

Source: batman-news.com

By NICOLE WALLACK

“Hello, My Name Is Doris” 
is something of a coming-of-
age story for someone who 
technically should have already 
come of age. The indie film stars 
Oscar-winner Sally Field as Doris 
Miller, a woman in her 60s who 
has never truly lived, until she 
meets and falls for John Fremont 
(played by “New Girl” actor Max 
Greenfield), a man half her age. 
Miller lived a rather singular 
existence, caring for her elderly 
mother on Staten Island, while 
taking the ferry into Manhattan 
each day to be a low-level data-
entry employee. Miller’s life was 
centered on caring for her ailing 
mother, while hoarding discarded 
household items found on the 
street to populate the home that 
she and her mother shared (the 
claustrophobic house mimicked 
the trapped feeling of her life). 
When the death of her mother 
coincides with the arrival of 
Fremont as her company’s new 
art director, Miller begins her real 
arrival into the world. 
When Miller mistakes 
Fremont’s kindness as flirting, 
she begins to fall for him from 
afar, even employing her friend’s 
13-year-old granddaughter 
Vivian (played by “Better Off 
Ted” actress Isabella Acres) to 
create a fake Facebook profile to 
figure out what Fremont likes. 
The dynamic between Vivian 
and Miller proves to be quite 
comedic as the teenager shows 
the woman, who is old enough 
to be her grandmother, how to 
navigate the Internet landscape 
enough to flirt with Fremont in 
person. When Vivian points out 
an electro-pop band named Baby 
Goya and the Nuclear Winters 
(fronted by Jack Antonoff from 
the band fun.) that Fremont liked 
on Facebook, Miller begins 
to listen to the band to have a 
common interest with him. When 

Fremont notices that Miller 
listened to the band, the two 
begin a real friendship.
Miller is quite eccentric, yet 
this makes her a favorite among 
the hipster community that 
Fremont himself is a part of. The 
clothes that she has had since the 
80s have come back into fashion 
among the hipsters, to the point at 
which Miller becomes something 
of an icon to them as the highest 
level of authentic. 
When Miller attends a Baby 
Goya and the Nuclear Winters 
concert (which she knows 
Fremont will be at) dressed in 
the retro neon clothes that she 
has owned for decades, she 
attracts the attention of the band’s 
frontman and is made into the 
cover art for their next album. 
Miller and Fremont have a 
series of misunderstandings about 
the nature of their relationship, 
which really makes the audience 
empathetic to the plight of Miller, 
who’s lost in the world. Yet it is 
through her experiences that she 
emerges a more full person. 
Field is, as always, an absolute 
delight to see onscreen and really 
embraces the erratic, yet well-
intentioned nature of Miller. 
Greenfield, playing something 
of a kinder and softer role than 
audiences accustomed to seeing 
him on “New Girl” may expect, 
has a wonderful dynamic with 
Field, one that keeps the more 
plodding and unbelievable parts 
of the plot still captivating. 
The script is far from 
perfect, but it is engaging and 
heartwarming, made all the 
better by the electric chemistry 
of Greenfield and Field. There 
is an almost nervous energy 
surrounding the two when they 
are together stemming from a 
sometimes one-sided, seemingly 
forbidden lust. It is this energy 
and chemistry coupled with a 
well-meaning and comedic plot 
that makes this film a must see. 

FILM REVIEWS

By LEE McPETERS

The highly anticipated film, “Batman v. 
Superman: Dawn of Justice,” was released in 
theaters on March 25 to harsh reviews by critics. 
At the core, it was a very dark film — and that 
darkness prevailed throughout. The characters were 
shallow and confusion reigned at many points in the 
film, as there was too much going on at once. 
At a runtime of two and a half hours, the film 
was tiring and overwhelming. Fans were hoping for 
a well-packed runtime, but there was little to the 
overall depth of characters and content. There was 
so much information that it was almost too much to 
take in. 
The movie starts at the end of “Man of Steel,” 
which came out in 2013, in which they show the 
final battle between Superman and General Zod 
through Bruce Wayne’s eyes. The Wayne Finance 
building is destroyed amid the chaos and innocent 
people are killed, setting Wayne on a path to find 
and destroy Superman. 
Batman is played by Ben Affleck, a new face 
in the Batman world, while Superman is played 
by returning actor Henry Cavill. “Man of Steel” 
already established Superman’s origins yet the 
audience doesn’t get to see much of Batman’s 
backstory except for the night his parents were 
killed, which is a scene we have seen so many times 
it comes across as redundant and unnecessary. 
The audience is then brought into a world that 
is dark and depressing. Located in what seems to 
be an open cornfield, Wayne Manor is destroyed 
so Wayne lives in a small, glass, apartment-
like structure on the premises. This opens many 
questions, as we never learn why the manor is 

destroyed or why it was not rebuilt. 
Jesse Eisenberg plays Lex Luthor, a character 
who was disappointing to watch. Eisenberg 
portrayed a Luthor that was slightly deranged and 
silly, sometimes to the point of breakdown. Viewers 
never truly learn why he hates Superman and why 
he puts Batman and Superman at odds with each 
other. In the end Batman and Superman team up to 
fight against him and that alliance is a sight I wish 
more of the movie had been about. 
A new character that we have never seen before 
is Wonder Woman, played by Gal Gadot. While she 
is instrumental in the final fight sequence, she too 
does not have much of a backstory. The audience 
encounters her through Wayne a few times in the 
movie, but the only reason she is there is to recover 
a secret photo, which doesn’t seem to matter in the 
larger story. 
As a whole, the movie is very anti-Superman. 
Batman, Lex Luthor and even the government 
are against him. Although they all have different 
intentions, the message is clear: Superman must go. 
A question in my mind was “why?” This was 
never fully answered throughout the movie. We 
do get glimpses of future DC movies though, with 
quick cameos of Aquaman, The Flash, and Cyborg, 
which led to excitement and interest. There is hope 
that those movies will be better.
As a whole, the movie was entertaining to 
watch, but it didn’t reach the level of past Batman 
and Superman movies. If the time was filled with 
deeper, richer content it would have been much 
better. Viewers, though, can still have hope for the 
future with the glimpses we received of characters 
to come, as well as “Suicide Squad,” which is due 
to be released later this year.

BvS: Dawn of underwhelming 

By DIEGO CAGARA

Somewhere atop an apartment 
building in Hell’s Kitchen, Manhattan, 
a mysterious vigilante, equipped with 
a plethora of guns, grenades, hand-
to-hand combat and a foul mouth, 
is independently killing rival gang 
members, a risky endeavor even 
Daredevil is hesitant towards. Known 
as the Punisher, viewers would learn 
about his backstory to help explain his 
seemingly barbarous tactics which may 
depict him as mentally disturbed.
Neftlix began streaming the second 
season of “Marvel’s Daredevil” on 
March 18, welcoming fans back to 
its uncompromising, bone-smashing 
yet captivating environment where 
Daredevil (Charlie Cox) struggles 
to balance his life as Matt Murdock 
while encountering iconic comic book 
characters Elektra Natchios (Elodie 
Yung) and the Punisher (Jon Bernthal). 
Following in the footsteps of the 
acclaimed singularly-shot hallway 
fight scene from season 1 episode “Cut 
Man,” the action and fight sequences 
remain professionally filmed while still 
capturing the gritty nature. The show 
does not hold back when it comes to 
showcasing graphic and violent content, 
particularly when the unrelenting 
Punisher stands his ground against a 
dozen muscular, dagger-wielding men. 
The Punisher, real name Frank Castle, 
had witnessed his family die from a 
savage gang-against-gang shootout 
near a carousel at Central Park prior 
to the second season, pushing him to 
seek revenge on each gang member 
with brutal force, epitomizing him as 
an antihero. His belief in retribution 
contrasts from Daredevil’s preference for 
justice, this ideological battle enveloping 
the first four episodes. 
“You hit ‘em and they get back up, 
I hit ‘em and they stay down!” the 
Punisher defiantly declared.
Bernthal’s no-nonsense portrayal is 
one of the season’s highlights, viewers 
already confident in this casting decision 
after his stellar performance as Shane 
Walsh in AMC’s “The Walking Dead.”
Meanwhile, the close friendship, 

akin to a bromance, between Murdock 
and Foggy Nelson (Elden Henson) is 
one of the more outstanding elements, 
helping to drive the human aspect 
of the show. Nelson’s concern for 
Murdock’s well-being, now aware of 
his dual identity, succeeds in emotively 
challenging Daredevil as to whether 
constantly getting beaten up or feeling 
exhausted from his heroic duties is worth 
it. Romance is explored when their 
mutual colleague and friend, Karen Page 
(Deborah Ann Woll) develops feelings 
for Murdock, both sharing a passionate 
kiss under the rain, similar to Mary Jane 
Watson’s famous liplock with Spider-
Man from 2002. 
Murdock’s closely-
knitted bonds with 
those two are severed 
when Elektra, a former 
flame, shows up in his 
apartment and Nelson 
is reluctant to defend 
the Punisher in court 
after he was arrested by 
police, believing that 
losing the case would 
end their already-
troubled firm. The show 
manages to depict how 
pressured Murdock feels 
as Elektra asks for his 
help with dealing with 
the enigmatic Roxxon 
Energy Corporation. 
Flashbacks reveal that 
Elektra and Murdock 
once dated in college 
but parted due to her 
willing-to-murder 
personality and her 
signature sai debut in the 
tenth episode. 
To make room for 
the new characters, 
the season, however, 
suffers from the absence 
of murdered journalist 
Ben Urich (Vondie 
Curtis-Hall), and how 
nurse Claire Temple 
(Rosario Dawson) and 
incarcerated crime lord 
Wilson Fisk (Vincent 

D’Onofrio) appear in fewer episodes 
than in season 1. Temple and Page 
become stronger female characters as 
the former single-handedly fought off 
ninjas while helping Daredevil with 
her medical expertise while the latter’s 
curious disposition pushes her to pursue 
more investigative work, somewhat 
taking up the mantle from Urich.
To continue tying in with the larger 
Marvel Cinematic Universe, references 
to “The Avengers” (2012) and Netflix’s 
other binge-worthy show “Marvel’s 
Jessica Jones” (2015) are intermittent, 
hoping for viewers to still mainly focus 
on Daredevil’s narrative though. 
Perhaps New Yorkers should vacate 

the city as it’s become the epicenter of 
superhero-inclusive battles, damaged 
property and underground organized 
crime. Nonetheless, season 2 of 
“Daredevil” continues to thrill with 
new characters, expanding on existing 
relationships, fast-paced action and 
providing social commentary on the 
state’s justice system, all revolving 
around the Devil of Hell’s Kitchen. 
However, the season sometimes feels 
uneven as the core cast are somewhat 
pushed to the background due to the 
influx of new characters. Thus, if the 
show receives a third season, the writers 
should not forget the great chemistry 
among the remaining original cast.

The University at Albany Equestrian Team 
has 13 members, ranging from freshmen to 
seniors, but for student athletes who don’t want 
to compete and would rather just ride for fun, 
there is a UAlbany Equestrian Club.
Lessons take place at Hunter Way Farm, 
located in Delanson, New York, 30 minutes 
away from campus. Team members have one-
hour lessons twice a week while club members 
are only required to have one lesson a week. 
“Flat” lessons focus on how we look during 
the walk, trot, and canter. Focus is placed on 

how our body appears and if we can keep 
the horse moving using our legs. “Jumping” 
lessons focus on our position over the jumps, 
checking for distances in between jumps, and 
thinking about the speed of our horse going 
over the jumps. 
Horse shows take place back-to-back for 
several weekends, held at Skidmore College, 
Hartwick College and Morrisville State 
College. During show days, the team wakes up 
by 5 a.m., eats breakfast, then drives between 
45 minutes to two hours to get to the college 
where the show will be taking place. 
Normally, shows last between 10 to 12

hours, and the entire team stays until the last 
class to see everyone ride.
As a member of the team that’s 
competing at Regionals, I’m thankful for 
my coach and my teammates, since they 
made my experience being on the UAlbany 
Equestrian Team an amazing one. 
I rode when I was younger, but 
stopped because I wanted to focus on 
my schoolwork. When I first came 
to UAlbany last year as a freshman, 
I found out about the team through 
MyInvolvement. During my first semester 
here, I joined the club, and rode twice a 
week for an opportunity to start showing 
and preparing for the spring semester. 
I officially joined the team last spring 
semester and have been showing since 

(showing refers to competing.) 
Riding on the team has become one of 
my biggest passions in college not only 
because I love horseback riding, but also 
because the team and our coach provides a 
great support system. There will be times 
when we have a bad lesson or don’t do 
well in our class at the show, but because 
of the team’s encouragement and support, 
I brush it off and aim to do better next 
time.
“It’s so exciting to watch everyone 
grow and become a better rider as the 
seasons go on,” said co-captain Ally 
Herald, “I’m proud of the bond we have 
as a team, how we’re a family and how I 
now have a bunch of sisters I can turn to 
for anything.”

The University at Albany softball team finished the 
weekend with three wins over UMass Lowell. The team 
remains undefeated in conference play after the series 
sweep and last week’s two wins over Hartford.
 “We started off the weekend a little slow,” said head 
coach Chris Cannata,“But after we came back and won that 
first game 5-4, I think we were back to being the team I’m 
used to seeing out there.”
 UMass Lowell started off Friday’s series scoring 
quickly by taking a three-run lead over the Danes in the 
top of the first inning. But it only took Albany until the 
bottom of the third inning to cut the deficit to 3-2 with a 
big homerun from senior Maggie Cocks.
 Albany continued its strong hitting and came back to 
win the game 5-4. Freshman McKenzie Bump, sophomore 
Donna Conrad and Cocks all had multi-hit performances in 
the win.
 The Danes faced Lowell again Saturday afternoon in a 
double-header, despite the gusty winds and hail. Albany 
finished the first game of the day with a 5-1 win. Devin 
Durando, the sophomore pitcher, earned the win for the 
Great Danes. Durando allowed just one run, five hits and 
tallied six strikeouts on the day.
 But the real story came during the second game on 
Saturday with freshman pitcher Celeste Verdolivo. 
Verdolivo threw a perfect game and junior Mackenzie 
Cleary closed out the game in the bottom of the sixth 
inning with a walk-off grand slam.
 The Danes got on the board scoring their first three runs 
in the bottom of the second inning. Donna Conrad started 
the inning with a double up the left field line, followed by 
a walk from freshman Sarah Petzold that set up a double 
steal allowing Conrad to score. Freshman McKenzie bump 
and senior Kelly Costello both reached base on walks, and 
Maggie Cocks’ fielder’s choice and Liz Snow’s RBI walk 
propelled the Danes to a 3-0 lead.
 Bump added another run in the bottom of the fourth 
inning with a single up the middle, a steal to second, and a 
steal home off a wild pitch.
 Mackenzie Cleary would put an early end to the game 
in the bottom of the sixth inning with a mercy rule walk-
off grand slam. The early end to the game would secure 
Celeste Verdolivo’s perfect game, the first of her career 
and the first for the Danes since 2011.
 “It feels really good,” said Verdolivo. “I couldn’t have 
done it without my team. They made a lot of good plays 
behind me.”
Verdolivo finished the win with an impressive five 
strikeouts in just six innings.
 The Danes are back on the field Tuesday at Bryant and 
continue conference play next weekend at UMBC.

UAlbany to discontinue program after 2016 season

By TROY FARKAS

The University at Albany Athletic 
Department will not offer women’s tennis 
beyond the 2016 spring season.
The announcement, made last week 
by Athletic Director Mark Benson, came 
after two America East programs, UMBC 
and Hartford, discontinued their programs 
within the last calendar year. 
UAlbany has followed suit, determining 
it is in the best interests of the university to 
drop the program.
Benson and his staff have worked in the 
past few months to find a new conference 
for the UAlbany tennis team. They reached 
out to other conferences to see if UAlbany 
could join as an associate member, but no 
suitable options were found. The possibility 
of becoming an independent program also 
was on the table, but because UAlbany 

would be unable to win a conference 
championship to qualify for the NCAA 
Tournament, that option was nixed.
“We are here to graduate student-athletes 
and win championships,” Benson said. 
“It’s a big reason why athletes play college 
sports.”
The team found out about the news 
the day after Benson and his staff made 
the decision to discontinue the program. 
They first informed Head Coach Gordon 
Graham, and then at a routine team meeting 
the next morning, Graham delivered the 
news to his players.
“It totally came from nowhere,” said 
Mirielle Hermans, the lone senior on the 
team. “I was really surprised.”
The team will play out the rest of the 
2016 season. But with nothing to play for 
beyond this spring, the Great Danes will 
look to go out with a bang.

“The team is more determined to win the 
America East to show everyone they made 
a mistake,” Hermans said.
As a senior, the decision does not 
affect the immediate future of Hermans. 
However, the other eight women—seven 
of whom were born in other countries--
will have to decide if they want to stay at 
UAlbany to earn a degree or seek tennis 
opportunities at other schools.
Benson said the school will honor the 
scholarship of any of the women if they 
wish to remain at UAlbany. If a player 
decides she will transfer to play tennis 
at another school, UAlbany will provide 
her with a “blanket release,” meaning the 
school will willingly release the player 
and allow her to look at other schools, 
according to Benson. 
In most transfer situations, a student-
athlete must sit out a year before playing in 

games for their team, while still attending 
classes. But in this situation, any UAlbany 
tennis player who transfers will be 
immediately eligible to play.
Benson said it’s “too early to tell” if 
some of the players will leave, despite 
UAlbany already receiving inquiries about 
several players. Hermans meanwhile said it 
would be “logical” for a current freshman 
or sophomore to seek tennis opportunities 
elsewhere.
Graham declined to comment to the 
Albany Student Press, but in an official 
statement released to the school, he said: 
“I appreciate that UAlbany administrators 
had a tough decision to make and that 
they did what they thought was in the best 
interests of the university.  Naturally I 
am disappointed; sad for the players, my 
assistant coach and our many loyal fans.  
This program has made great strides in the 
last five years. And before we sign off, we 
are on a mission to win the last America 
East tennis championships.”
“Coach has worked so hard and he’s 
getting it taken away from him,” Hermans 
said. Benson said the school will honor the 
contract of the head coach as well as the 
assistant, Petra Ferancova.
The Athletic Department will reallocate 
existing funds into areas that will 
strengthen their Title IX position, the 1972 
provision prohibiting sexual discrimination 
in education. Residual funds will also go 
to other areas that will benefit all student-
athletes from a student welfare perspective, 
according to the press release.
UAlbany (9-5) has four more regular 
season matches, with the last one coming 
on April 16. The first three will be at home. 
The America East Conference Tournament 
is scheduled for April 22-24 at UMBC. If 
UAlbany wins the conference, they will 
advance to the NCAA Championships, 
which begin in early May.
