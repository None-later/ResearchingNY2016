After a struggle to obtain tickets to this 
year’s Parkfest, some students are demand-
ing a change to the system. 
The first 500 tickets to the spring concert 
were distributed to students during the 
Cultural Carnival on April 17 and the fol-
lowing days of ticket distribution resulted in 
students skipping class and work to line up 

as early as 6:30 a.m. 
On Monday, April 18, the first day of 
ticket distribution, the overwhelmed Student 
Association shut down further sales after be-
ing mobbed by the student body. To release 
their anger and frustration with the distribu-
tion, students took to social media. 
In a post on Facebook, sophomore 
environmental science major Madison 
Corbeil said, “I am a dedicated student 

and also hold a part time job. I should be 
rewarded for working hard, NOT penalized 
for going to class. Instead, I am excluded 
from the main spring social event because 
I can’t afford to skip all of my classes and 
spend hours waiting in line.” 
 Donavan Swanson, director of Program-
ming for SA and a senior public adminis-
tration major, immediately reached out to 
students and provided his email address to 

those who wanted to voice their concerns. 
One of the foremost complaints among 
students is that Parkfest ticket sales are not 
online. The University at Buffalo had its 
SpringFest tickets available for purchase 
through Ticketmaster.
 Swanson has addressed this issue and 
said online ticket sales will be available next 

ON CAMPUS
LIMITED PARKFEST TIX PROMPTS CHANGES

The growing popular-
ity of the online lodging 
service Airbnb has changed 
the way people list, find and 
rent overnight residency, 
but according to a study 
conducted by University at 
Albany alumnus Michael 
Luca, the increase in online 
anonymity may leave more 
room for discrimination. 
Luca returned to campus 
on Thursday, April 22 to 
speak about the research 
that he and his coworkers, 
Dan Svirsky and Benjamin 
Edelman, have conducted 
about discrimination 
through Airbnb. Luca and 
his team created 6,400 
accounts looking to rent 
homes in Washington, D.C., 
Los Angeles, Baltimore, 
Dallas and St. Louis, with 
each account named under 
stereotypical white and 
black names. 
The experiment aimed to 
see how the rental experi-
ence of an individual with 
a stereotypical black name 
would compare with the 
renting success of some-
one with a stereotypically 
white name, and the results 
showed that there were high 
levels of discrimination 
against black guests from 
both white and black hosts.
Under the study, the 
created accounts with 
black-sounding names, such 
as Jermaine and Tyrone, 
were accepted 15 percent 
less often than those with 
white-sounding names, like 
Allison and Brad. 
UAlbany students that 
are users of Airbnb said the 
results of Luca’s study are 
revealing.  
“This is eye-opening,” 
said Whitney Martuscello, 
a junior studying social 
welfare. “That’s not fair at 
all. I’d be pretty upset too if 
I were discriminated against 
just because of my name.” 
Both Martuscello and her 
friends use Airbnb.
Graduating with a bach-
elor’s degree in economics 
and mathematics in 2002, 
Luca’s choice to focus on 
race in Airbnb was based on 
its “fantastic example of an 
online marketplace.” Luca 
said that since the website 
lets users see the race of 
hosts that were anony-
mously participating in the 
study, the results are more 
accurate than a website that 
does not allow the host or

Discrimination

The abatement of asbestos in the 
Campus Center at the University at 
Albany is complete.
However, asbestos removal 
across the entire campus will not 
be complete for at least another 10 
years, according to Kerry Csontos, 
who is in charge of coordinating 
campus-wide asbestos removal. 
The asbestos removal on campus 
began more than 10 years ago, 
according to John Giarrusso, 
associate vice president of Finance 
& Administration for Facilities 
Management. 
The Campus Center abatement 

did not begin until the summer of 
2014.
“We on campus, like everyone 
in the country, are regulated 
for asbestos removal when it is 
disturbed,” Giarrusso said. “When 
the oversight and attention started, 
I’m not sure… We’ve been 
dealing with it on every project for 
decades.”
Abatement became a concern 
in the 1970s when organizations 
such as the U.S. Environmental 
Protection Agency, and the New 
York State Departments of Health 
and Labor began to regulate it. 
Stephen Pearse, executive 
director of University Auxiliary 

Services, said this is normal for 
most buildings built between the 
1950s and ‘70s.
“Most of this campus was 
built in the late ‘60s,” Pearse 
said. “Asbestos was a miracle 
substance back in the ‘60s and it 
appeared in so many of the building 
components: floor tile, wall siding, 
mastics and caulk.” 
In the Campus Center at 
UAlbany, much of the Asbestos 
Containing Materials (ACM) were 
in the glue used to hold down floor 
tiles, according to Csontos. There 
was also asbestos present in thermal 
duct insulations and exhausts ducts. 
Other SUNY schools have 

similar asbestos removal projects. 
The University at Buffalo has been 
dealing with abatement products 
since at least 2005, according to 
The Spectrum, UBuffalo’s student 
newspaper. SUNY Oswego has had 
projects involving asbestos removal 
since at least 2007, according to 
WTOP News 10. SUNY Canton, 
Binghamton University, and SUNY 
Geneseo also reference abatement 
on their websites.
“Asbestos removal is a highly 
regulated and rather routine part 
of virtually any significant work 
we do to alter or upgrade original 

Campus asbestos removal may take decades

New technology in the 
University at Albany’s 
Parking and Mass Transit 
Office is intended to help 
students avoid parking tick-
ets and improve customer 
service, according to the 
parking director. 
“At least two pictures of 
the citation will be down-
loaded into the computer 
through a ticketing machine 
which can help for the ap-
peal process giving visual 
evidence,” said Jason Jones, 
parking director at UAl-
bany. 
Various payment 
methods like meters, online 
visitor passes as well as 
physical passes that are sold 
at the parking office, and 
pay and display machines in 
SEFCU are also available.
 “We are moving toward 
mobile pay technology to 
replace meters. LPR sys-
tems are plate recognition 
that speeds up seven times 
the job for the enforcers,” 
Jones said.
One of the many ways 
Mass Transit is trying to 
help students from receiv-
ing tickets is upgrading the 
signs in the Colonial Quad 
parking lot, where many 
tickets are given out. 
According to Jones, 
they plan on changing the 
stripes to white and yellow

Workers in the Capital 
Region rallied together on 
April 15 with Citizen Action of 
New York at two McDonald’s 
restaurants to protest for a $15 
statewide minimum wage.
The first rally began at 8 
a.m. at the Hoosick Street 
McDonald’s in Troy. Another 
followed at the McDonald’s on 
South Pearl Street in Albany at 
5 p.m. 
These rallies came just two 
weeks after the release of the 
2016-2017 New York State 
Budget announced a minimum 
wage raise to $15 an hour by 
2018 for parts of the state.  
Mark Emanation, the 
community organizer for 
Citizen Action, has spent the 
last five years actively pushing 

for a minimum wage increase.
“We’ve been working 
for several years now to get 
the Legislature to raise the 
minimum wage…and this year 
we were successful in getting 
some of it done,” Emanation 
said. “New York City got $15 
by 2018, Westchester County 
and Long Island by 2019.”

Upstate exclusion 

Despite these victories, 
however, it seems as though 
the rest of the state might have 
been left out. 
Upstate New York will raise 
its hourly minimum wage to 
$12.50 by 2020. 
Emanation is not alone in 
his dissatisfaction with the 
significantly slower increase of 
minimum wage upstate. 

“It shouldn’t take graduation 
into it, it should take effect 
now,” said Jacque Jordan, 
a McDonald’s employee of 
seven years. “There’s no 
reason they [McDonald’s 
CEOs] can’t do it, they have 
the money.”
Jordan is frustrated with her 
current living situation, which 
is all she can afford with her 
wages. 
“I live in a hotel, I pay $250 
a week and my paychecks are 
$189 to $199 a week so I have 
to beg and borrow every week 
to make ends meet, which is no 
way to live,” she said.

Raising children on fast-food 
wages

The rally also had several 
strollers scattered around 

the location. According to a 
2015 Fiscal Policy Institute 
testimony, 26 percent of fast-
food employees have one or 
more children. 
A similar study conducted 
in 2013 by the UC-Berkley 
Center for Labor Research 
and Education, along 
with University of Illinois 
at Urbana-Champaign 
Department of Urban & 
Regional Planning, found 
that 20 percent of fast-food 
employees have family 
incomes below the federal 
poverty line with 23 percent in 
a “near poverty” status. This 
is defined as having an overall 
income between 100 to 200 
percent of the federal poverty 
line.
“I have kids to worry about 
and I need the union and I 
need benefits,” said Elizabeth 
Ritchie, an employee at Moe’s 
Southwest Grill. 

Concerns for raising the 
minimum wage

Critics of raising the 
minimum wage have predicted 
an increase in product prices, 
layoffs to compensate for 
high labor costs, and the risk 
of businesses closing, but 
proponent Joseph Paparonne of 
FOCUS Churches of Albany 
disagreed. 
“The arguments against 
raising the minimum wage 
have been the same since the 
minimum wage was instituted 
and they’ve always been 
wrong,” he said. 
FOCUS Churches of Albany 
hosts a number of food pantries 
and soup kitchens throughout 
Albany, and Paparonne often 
sees low wage workers at their 
doors. 

“When you give people 
who are living in poverty 
more money, they spend more 
money immediately. That is 
actually an economic driver 
and that increases demand 
locally and helps build new 
business and new jobs,” he 
said.  
William “Bill” Ritchie, 
president of the Albany 
Federation of Labor, had a 
similar view to Paparonne. 
He believes that an increase 
in minimum wage among 
fast-food employees would 
increase demand and allow 
employees to “spend their 
money immediately at places 
like McDonald’s.”
“As far as I’m concerned, 
if the price of a Big Mac 
has to be increased by 10 or 
20 cents so that people can 
have reasonable existences 
as workers, then I am for it,” 
Ritchie said. 

The Next Steps

While the future of the 
Fight for 15 in upstate remains 
unclear, protestors at Friday’s 
rally remained optimistic. 
According to Emanation, 
Citizen Action, with the help 
of local unions and churches, 
was able to find Jordan an 
apartment that she’ll move into 
at the end of the month. 
 “We’re gonna go back and 
continue to fight over there. 
Build rallies, get new people 
elected, if they don’t want to 
vote for it get rid of them and, 
and that’s what I think about, 
it’s important to keep this out 
here,” said Emanation.

FIGHT FOR FIFTEEN

By MIDDLE EARTH

College life places rigorous schedul-
ing demands on students. Students juggle 
various assignments and deadlines across 
multiple classes; they have extra-curricular 
schedules such as sports teams and clubs, 
and many students manage work and intern-
ship schedules as well. For many students, 
college is their first experience with such 
demanding and varied schedules. Add to 
these demands the challenges associated 
with being away from home, trying to 
establish new friendships, and discovering 
who they will be in the world, and it is easy 
to understand why the experience of feeling 
anxious is so common among the col-
lege population. While some of the social 
aspects of college life (e.g., friendships and 
self-discovery) unfold rather organically 
and require some patience, the ability to 
manage one’s time effectively can offer 
some relief from anxiety.
Some students manage their schedules 
without the use of any tools such as day 
planners or smart phone calendars; they 
keep track of it all in their heads. Many 
of these students report doing quite well 
managing their time in this manner, but 
managing anxiety is another matter. When 

people describe the emotional experience of 
anxiety, they often mention racing thoughts, 
problems concentrating, feelings of dread, 
and difficulty getting rid of worries that 
rationally they recognize as dispropor-
tionate. This is where time management 
tools can help. Writing down one’s tasks, 
deadlines, appointments, etc. and checking 
them off as they are completed essentially 
removes them from one’s head and reduces 
the clutter that those racing thoughts and 
overwhelming dread may cause. Written 
down or stored in an electronic scheduling 
device, these items are less apt to fuel the 
experience of dread and looming angst. 
The distinction between tasks can become 
blurred in one’s mind during moments of 
feeling anxious; multiple manageable tasks 
can morph into what seems like one enor-
mous and unmanageable chore. Checklists 
and calendar tools provide users a way 
to break things down. For example, that 
20-page paper due at the end of the month 
might look something like this:
Day 1: Brainstorm topics, preliminary lit 
review (2 hours)
Day 2: Finalize topic, deeper lit review 
(4 hours)
Day 3: Create outline of paper, reference 
prof’s guidelines from syllabus (2 hours)

Day 4: R&R (Gym in the morning, 
lunch with a friend)
Day 5: Write draft for two sections 
of the outline (2 to 4 hours)
Day 6: Write draft for two more sec-
tions (2 to 4 hours)
Day 7: Revisit and complete first 
two sections
Be mindful that none of this 
information is intended to suggest 
that anxiety is not a real and difficult 
struggle for many students. If you find 
that you are having difficulties with 
time management or anxiety, there are 
options for you.  If you are a Univer-
sity at Albany student, you can make 
an appointment at Counseling and 
Psychological Services with a mental 
health professional to discuss this sub-
ject further.  To make an appointment 
with any of their clinicians, call 518-
442-5800. For additional information 
you can access their website at www.
albany.edu/counseling_center.  
Also, if you would like to talk to a 
peer about additional ways to effectively 
manage your time, you can call the Middle 
Earth Peer Assistance hotline at 518-442-
5777.  The Middle Earth Peer Assistance 
hotline is open when classes at UAlbany 

are in session during the academic year 
(September through May).  The hotline 
hours are from 1 p.m. to midnight Monday 
through Thursday, and 24 hours on the 
weekends beginning on Friday at 1 p.m.

construction here on 
campus,” Giarrusso said.
Removal can get pricy. 
The budget for the abatement 
within the Campus Center 
was included in its extension 
project budget. The cost 
of abatement in only 
the Campus Center was 
$575,000, according to 
Csontos. 
It is unclear how much it 
will cost to abate the entire 
campus, as every project has 
its own budget.
“There is no way to get an 
estimate of cost,” Giarrusso 
said.

He also said the removal 
will be drastic because 
asbestos is assumed to be in 
the majority of the buildings 
on campus. 
“All of the older buildings 
on this campus, on every 
campus and in every 
neighborhood in this country 
likely has [asbestos] in floor 
tiles, plaster, construction 
glues and adhesives, pipe 
insulation, fire rated doors, 
roofing felt and glazing,” he 
said. 
The entire removal 
process will take “probably 
decades.”
“We have over 5,000,000 
square feet, so getting to 
every building will take 
time,” Giarrusso said.

year.
 “Student Association was not 
guaranteed that service as of this year, 
resulting in physical tickets and lines,” 
Swanson said. 
The fact that ParkFest is an exclusive 
event made the demand for tickets that 
much greater. As of Thursday, event 
attendance for a school with almost 
13,000 undergraduate students was 
capped at 5,000 people, and 1,000 of 
those tickets were available to students 
who do not attend the university. 
Sophomore Nicole Lvov, an 
environmental science major, spent two 
hours on April 20 waiting in line and 
did not received tickets. 
“We pay for this with the student fee 

and I think it’s absolutely ridiculous 
that we have to wait in a line and not 
every student gets to go,” she said of the 
mandatory $100 fee that all UAlbany 
undergraduates have to pay. 
While the SA is a nonprofit entity 
separate from the university, it is the 
university that determines the capacity 
since the event is held on its property, 
according to Swanson. 
 “In the future if there is such a desire 
to attend Parkfest such as this year, 
Student Association would be forced to 
hold the concert off campus and begin 
to charge students in order to pay for the 
venue,” said Swanson. 
After April 18, ticket distribution 
was capped at 1,000 per day and the 
University Police Department helped 
manage the line. 
On Thursday it was decided that 
there would not be a physical ticket 
distribution after the university decided 

to increase the maximum capacity. 
Instead, SA would raffle off the 
remaining 1,000 tickets.  
Despite students’ dissatisfaction 
with the distribution of tickets, Colin 
Manchester, next year’s vice president 
of SA, hopes students will look on the 
positive side of the event.
“As far as ParkFest goes, I think 
the lineup we have really reaches out 
through many genres and appeals 
to a broad amount of students,” said 
Manchester, a junior who is double 
majoring in financial market regulation 
and financial analyst. 
ParkFest was held on Sunday, April 
24 for a crowd of 5,000 students on the 
State Quad Field and was hosted by 
Terrence J and DJ Young Chow with 
performances by Pusha T, Timeflies, 
Hippie Sabotage, Jeremih, and headliner 
Future.

Passover this year was 
celebrated from April 22 to April 
30, beginning Friday night at 
sundown and ending Sunday night 
at sundown. It is customary for 
this holiday in particular to be 
spent with family. Many Jewish 
kids want to go home, and many 
Jewish families expect them home. 
For many Jewish students at the 
University at Albany, it is not an 
option to stay on campus in order 
to attend a concert instead of 
celebrating Passover.
“Jewish people are not supposed 
to drive or travel by public transit 
within the first two days of 
Passover, also the two more widely 

celebrated days,” said Irit Block, 
wife of Rabbi Jeremy Block of 
Aish NY.
Jewish students would have 
likely gone home on Thursday or 
Friday and come back up to school 
some time late Sunday or Monday. 
Parkfest was Sunday, April 24, with 
doors opening at 1 p.m.
In my case, I don’t particularly 
care for Future, the headlining 
artist. I also am not so serious about 
my religion that if Parkfest were to 
feature an artist I did want to see, I 
would travel during the hours many 
others wouldn’t. However, I am not 
the only Jewish student on campus, 
and I personally know plenty of 

Jewish people who both celebrate 
Passover and would have liked to 
see Future.
One such student is Bryan 
Nichols, who said he originally 
planned on going home for 
Passover, but decided to stay on 
campus this year so that he could 
attend Parkfest. He had been unable 
to attend previous years because of 
finals and end-of-semester papers. 
He’ll be celebrating Passover at 
Rabbi Block’s home Friday night, 
and Rabbi Gavriel Horan’s home 
on Saturday night.
Nothing is wrong with Nichols 
wanting to attend Parkfest, but 
some people are more observant 
of the holiday than him. Senior 
Jennifer Perlman went home 
for the holiday, even though 
she loves Future and had been 
looking forward to Parkfest since 
September. She said she didn’t feel 
like it was really a choice, because 
for her it was like choosing between 
God and a concert. Perlman feels 
it’s disrespectful to have the 
concert scheduled this weekend, 

when it could have been held any 
other weekend that didn’t fall on a 
religious holiday.
So then why, with Passover 
being a well-known Jewish holiday 
and UAlbany having a large 
Jewish population, would Parkfest 
be held during a weekend when 

many Jewish students could not 
be in Albany? Was the university 
unaware of the holiday, or did they 
not care that Jewish students would 
have to miss the yearly concert?
Whatever the case, plenty 
of Jewish students are feeling 
overlooked. 

I

’m sure many are familiar with the Jewish 
holiday of Passover. Many may have seen the 
“Rugrats” episode with Grandpa Boris talking 
about the Jewish exodus from slavery in Egypt. 
There is a chance most people have a Jewish 
friend who celebrates the holiday and has spoken 
about their Seder with them.

he First Amendment says: “Congress shall 
make no law respecting an establishment of 
religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; 
or abridging the freedom of speech, or of the 
press…” 
Therefore, censorship is a clear violation of our First 
Amendment rights. 
A Google search of the word “censorship” defines it as, 
“the practice of officially examining books, movies, etc., 
and suppressing unacceptable parts.”
Recently, the Albany Student Press received the 
unfortunate news that tour guides at the University at 
Albany campus were disposing copies of the paper 
because the word “assault” was written across the top. It’s 
believed that admissions didn’t want potential students to 
get the wrong idea about the university. 
Editor-in-Chief Kassie Parisi covered the incident for 
the ASP. The ASP obtained a tour guide group message 
which read, “Hi team! If anyone is in the LCs today and 
sees the ASP that says something about assault. Please 
remove them. Grab a stack and recycle them. I felt 
horrible doing it but it’s just not something we want to 
welcome our families with this weekend.” 
The censored article in question “focused on the fact 
that the reports are increasing because there are now 
more ways for students on campus to report and get help 
regarding sexual assault, such as the University Advocacy 
Center,” Parisi wrote.
This is just one example of how censorship doesn’t 

work. Had the article been carefully looked at, this 
entire mess could have been prevented. The article was 
in the interest of the university and could have been 
incorporated in the tours to say that the University is 
advocating for the awareness of sexual violence on 
college campuses and is actually doing something about 
it. The article’s message was lost under the discretion of 
the tour guide; it was a bad judgment call.
As reported in Parisi’s article, UAlbany Provost James 
Stellar responded to the incident, saying, “The decision 
was an inappropriate judgment call, and inconsistent with 
our values as a University. The free and open exchange 
of data and ideas is a principle on which we, and all 
universities, stand. I would like to take this opportunity to 
apologize to the ASP.”
UAlbany administration were fortunately able to 
recover the papers and get them back on stands fairly 
quickly, which is good news for the ASP.
But, the ASP is certainly not the first school paper 
plagued with censorship. 
According to David R. Wheeler in an article for The 
Atlantic, Lori McKown was an adviser for the school 
paper at Butler University in Indianapolis. This past 
September, she was relieved from her position. 
According to the article, “Her most recent employee 
evaluation, signed on April 13, 2015, had listed a rating 
of ‘above expectations,’ asserting that she ‘consistently 
performs at a level that meets, and often exceeds, the 
institution’s expectations.’”
It was later revealed that McKown had sent a private 
email which spurred her release from the adviser position. 

What tops it off - she was replaced with someone from 
the university’s public relations team.
“It’s a clear conflict of interest for a university public 
relations professional to advise a college newspaper,” said 
College Media Association President Rachele Kanigel.
Wheeler asks in his article, “In an era of tight budgets, 
and heightened brand consciousness, are administrators 
more afraid than ever to leave students in charge of the 
student newspaper?”
Maybe I can understand that a university wants to 
display its campus with the utmost esteem, but to hide the 
voice of its students is a violation of our rights. 
If the right to free speech is clearly defined in the 
Constitution, at the very beginning no less, then that right 
should be respected despite the “negative” repercussions 
it may have. 
According to an article in The Atlantic, Susan Zake, a 
journalism professor at Kent State University, wrote, “I 
still find it hard to believe that a bunch of smart people 
at a university can’t understand what a free student press 
should look like.”
Zake puts into words exactly what most of us are 
thinking. How can someone think that violating the 
Constitution can make the school look better?
And realistically, I don’t think a lot of those students 
would have stopped to look at the paper, especially during 
a walking tour. Even if they did, I’m sure they would 
have had the common decency to actually read at least the 
first paragraph or so.
 The ASP is another student paper that was silenced.

SILENCING THE VOICES OF STUDENTS

CENSORSHIP

Kevin Mercado / 
Albany Student Press

The Albany Student 
Press experienced  
its first-ever form 
of censorship that 
can be traced. Tour 
guides during the 
Accepted Students 
Open House were 
told to remove all 
ASP issues that 
featured the headline 
“Assault reports up 
200 percent,” as it 
looked bad on the 
university as a whole, 
despite the story 
speaking favorably 
for the university. 
Students are more 
open to report sexual 
assault.

C

ollege is the official practice run 
for life. And one of life’s many 
tasks includes being in charge of 
your own money. 
As the youth enter into young adulthood, 
we have been taught that money is 
important, it’s essential for a decent 
living. With this in mind, we either take 
that message seriously or as a joke. As a 
college student we are either overwhelmed 
in paranoia of being low on money or we 
spend without a care. Money is important, 
but it shouldn’t guide our lives.
As we were constantly reminded by 
our high school administration, the cost 
of college shouldn’t impact our decision. 
Yet how can we not let it? Simply being 
in college, a student is most likely in 
debt, setting the foundation for financial 
struggles. We don’t want to add on to this 
established debt.
I have experienced the life of the extreme 
sides of prioritizing money. I didn’t spend 
a single penny in the fall semester, however 
when the spring semester came around, I 
spent everything I had. It’s clear the ideal 
money spending habit is somewhere in the 
middle.
I have gotten to the point that I would 
think if I didn’t buy a pack of potato chips, 
I would save a dollar. I would save so much 
money if I didn’t buy anything, obviously. 
That is most definitely not the case. As 
much as a person would think that this 
dollar will stack up into millions, spending 
a dollar will not drown you in debt. By not 
spending money, you are restricting your 
potential of living. It’s good to save money, 
but what does one gain if all they do is 
save?
They may be able to afford one 
expensive object or experience, however 
the little experiences and expenses matter. 
Depriving oneself from buying snacks or 
buying new clothes is not experiencing all 
of life. It’s significant to point out that a 
student is able to buy a cup of coffee every 
now and then, and that won’t kill them 
financially. 

Nonetheless, no one should dedicate 
their life to paying off debts. Debts will be 
paid eventually, in theory. No one should 
dedicate all their money to debt, as it’s a 
part of life, not the entire span of it.
With that said, caution should still be 
used when considering going into debt. You 
can spend money, but not too much. You 
can buy some things, but not everything. 
If there is anything the majority of the 
University at Albany students spend fast 
or carelessly, it’s Munch Money. Many 
students treat Munch Money as if it’s not 
real money and swipe away, spending their 
$200 or $400 in the first month. And I 
think, when people waste it all, that is their 
first rude wake up call. 
Students continue the rest of the semester 
with no Munch Money, realizing that the 
next semester, they should be more cautious 
with their spending. Or they could be the 
person that adds on more Munch Money 
and indulge in their spending. 
“It’s so easy to keep buying things with 
Munch Money, but when you can’t buy 
anymore because you spent it all, that’s 
when I realized I need to calm down 
with the spending,” said Michael Chen, a 
UAlbany freshman. “I didn’t keep in mind 
my balance and I didn’t [waste] Munch 
Money for the second half of the semester.”
Mastering the art of spending is hard, 
especially for a college student, who 
is potentially putting all they have into 
education. Hopefully, this education 
will pay off in the end, and it should in 
theory. Nevertheless, going to college is 
already a risky move. Going to college is 
the equivalent of accepting debt. Unless 
someone is part of the lucky few who don’t 
have to worry about expenses, most are 
forced to accept debt. Congratulations to 
them, but I’m still going to worry about my 
money situation. 
I think it’s important to remind students 
that money isn’t everything. Don’t hinder 
yourself by not having money. But also, 
don’t hinder yourself by saving too much 
money. Ultimately, this is your money, this 
is your hard earned money. Spend it wisely 
and as you please.

BAND INTERVIEW
AMERICAN AUTHORS TO 
ROCK DOWNTOWN ALBANY

By NICOLE WALLACK

Rock band American Authors made a huge debut with 
their chart-topping single “Best Day of My Life” from 
their first album, “Oh, What A Life,” catapulting them 
into fame. Now, their follow-up album “What We Live 
For” seems poised to firmly plant the band in superstar 
status when it is released on May 13. 
I spoke with American Authors lead singer and 
guitarist Zac Barnett about the band’s upcoming album 
and their current club show tour, which will be passing 
through Albany at The Hollow Bar + Kitchen on Apr. 
27.

Albany Student Press: What motivated the small more 
intimate club shows for your tour?
Zac Barnett: We just wanted to start playing this new 
album. We’ve been working on it for so long that we 
wanted to do a tour leading up to everything else and 
really just make it a small intimate show where our fans 
can really come out, hear the new songs, and we can 
really start gauging a real reaction from people who 
know our music. 

ASP: Were you expecting the amazing success of those 
singles from your first album that prompted those big 
shows and all of that exposure?
ZB: Not really. We were just writing to write and we 
were just trying to write good, fun, exciting music for us, 
and we were trying to not hold back. And that was the 
first time we had ever done that where we weren’t trying 
to label ourselves or brand ourselves into any certain 

scene or genre, just kind of having fun. 

ASP: Did you feel any kind of pressure with that follow-
up album?
ZB: For sure…we just tried to really work as hard as we 
could and write the best songs that we could. And also it 
was important to us to not stop writing and not just feel 
like “Okay, we have some songs that are pretty good and 
stop.” …We’re still writing because you never know 
where something great is going to come from.

ASP: What is your writing process like?
ZB: It’s all super collaborative. You might get an initial 
idea, that’ll come from a certain person, but then we all 
bring it into a room and we all work on it together and 
make it into what the final product ends up being.

ASP: You were the Blue Pages, before you were 
American Authors, what prompted that name change?
ZB: We had just been a band for so long that we had 
been performing for so long under one name and our 
music had changed so much since the first day playing 
together. We were in a new city, we had moved from 
Boston to Brooklyn, and it was a new time and it seemed 
like the right move for a new chapter in our lives are 
musicians.

ASP: Do you feel that your experience going to Berklee 
College of Music helped you to develop your skills?
ZB: Berklee was great. Because for one, it allowed us 
to meet each other. Without Berklee, we wouldn’t know 
each other and we wouldn’t be in this band, at least not 

what it is today. So that’s huge right there. Also it’s nice 
because it does facilitate you with a bunch of tools that 
you may not use every day, but it’s always nice to have 
them in your back pocket ... I think that it just overall 
gives you a better understanding of music.

ASP: Do you have any advice for aspiring musicians?
ZB: Practice and having an open attitude about things. 
I know so many people who just stay in their own 
bubble and they’re not open to trying new things and 
are not open to doing things maybe a little differently. 
Music is changing so much nowadays, that you really 
need to have a good attitude and be open to always 
experimenting and always being willing to write with 
new people or experiment with new genres or try 
something that might be a little scary and a little different 
because without that you’re really just limiting yourself.

ASP: Who is your biggest musical influence?
ZB: I started out listening to classic rock, which is a 
huge part [like] The Beatles and Crosby, Stills, Nash & 
Young. That was always so huge. And then nowadays 
I’m always looking for new stuff. Our most collective 
influence is probably Coldplay. They’re just so great …
We’re taking so many influences from so many different 
places … while also staying true to who American 
Authors are. 

You can follow American Authors on Facebook, Twitter, 
and on weareamericanauthors.com for additional 
information on “What We Live For” and their current 
tour. “What We Live For” hits shelves on May 13.

LITERATURE

By JON MILLER

April is National Poetry Month, 
a time for bookworms and aspiring 
writers to celebrate the work of some 
of the greatest poets the genre has to 
offer. 
In correlation with National Poetry 
Month, the University at Albany’s 
own Leonard A. Slade, Jr. held “An 
Evening of Poetry” on Tuesday, 
April 19 to read and discuss his 
works. 
Slade is a professor in Africana 
Studies and English and the director 
of the Doctor of Arts in Humanistic 
Studies Program and Master of Arts 
in Liberal Studies Program. An 
expert in black literature and poetry, 
he is also a renowned writer with 
several published books of poetry. 
Slade read some of his best work 
to the crowd from his books “Sweet 
Solitude,” “God Put a Rainbow in 
the Sky” and his most recent book, 
“Nobody Knows.” In between each 
poem, Slade referenced quotes from a 
diverse group of poets. 
Some of the quotes from the 
mentioned poems included “Poetry 
is the spontaneous overflow of 

powerful feelings: it takes its 
origin from emotion recollected in 
tranquility” by William Wordsworth, 
and Slade’s personal favorite, 
“Poetry is the human soul, entire, 
squeezed like a lemon or lime, drop 
by drop into atomic words” by famed 
African-American poet Langston 
Hughes.
Beginning the night with a reading 
of “Acquittances,” much of Slade’s 
work tied back to his experiences as 
well as the people that he considers 
valuable to his life and work. 
Acknowledging those who inspired 
his work, he noted that many of 
his poems are dedicated to them. 
His wife, Roberta Hall Slade, to 
whom he dedicated his book “Sweet 
Solitude,” was also the inspiration for 
one of Slade’s poems in “God Put a 
Rainbow in the Sky.” 
George Hendrick, who donated to 
the Africana Studies scholarships that 
Slade is very much associated with, 
also influenced Slade’s poem, “My 
Professor.”  The poem is a tribute 
to someone that Slade considered a 
mentor and true inspiration when he 
was a studying student.
One of the most significant 

poems of the night was titled “Black 
Madonna” from “Sweet Solitude” 
which he owes his inspiration to his 
mother, Elizabeth Langford Slade, 
who he considers to have been his 
best friend. 
Much of Slade’s poetry covers 
social and racial issues of past and 
present. Significant in his work, 
it requires no arduous effort to 
see his true passion of African-
American history and the ways he 
incorporates it in his literature truly 
echoed throughout his three books. 
“Nobody Knows” featured references 
to the controversy in Ferguson, 
Missouri and the social injustices that 
accompanied it.
By far, the fiercest of  Slade’s 
work, “The Country Preacher’s Folk 
Prayer” was equipped in an almost 
gospel song and southern accent. As 
Slade sang and shouted the words, 
the crowd was able to feel and 
understand the compelling meaning 
behind each stanza. “The Country 
Preacher’s Folk Prayer” resonated 
with much of the listeners before 
Slade closed the evening again with 
Langston Hughes’ iconic quote.

Laura van den Berg visited the Writers 
Institute at the University at Albany to give a 
seminar for students last Thursday, April 21. As 
an excellent writer, van den Berg was bound to 
give the audience a treat, and that she did. 
Held in the Standish Room in the Science 
Library, the seminar started off with a 
spokesperson from the Writers Institute, who 
gave a short biography and started the discussion 
with few questions. 
The real treat came when the floor was 
opened up to the audience. Many students asked 
questions about everything from her writing 
process to more personal questions, such as how 
to work with struggles in writing, and how to get 
ideas as. Throughout, Van den Berg answered 
all questions in depth and with kindness. She 
was never aloof and never put down a question 
as stupid or irrelevant. 
“You can ask me anything…it is virtually 
impossible to embarrass me with anything,” van 
den Berg said. 
Van den Berg was raised in Florida and now 
lives in Boston with her husband who is also a 
writer. She is also a teacher - she expressed that 
she experiences much joy from both professions. 

She has written two short story collections: 
“What the World Will Look Like When All 
the Water Leaves Us” (2009) and “The Isle of 
Youth” (2013). 
“Find Me” is her first novel, released in 
2015, and she revealed that she has a new 
novel in the works as well as some new short 
stories. 
As a child, she did not enjoy school and 
eventually completed high school by finishing 
a GED. While attending night school, the 
idea of writing fiction never crossed her mind 
until she realized she didn’t enjoy her first 
major, philosophy, and decided to try a fiction 
workshop. 
Van den Berg also talked about her writing 
process. To her, she said, struggles and 
insecurities were things to embrace about 
the writing process, not a sign of weakness 
or insufficient talent or worth. While short 
stories are the format in which she enjoys to 
write most, she said that she enjoyed writing 
novels as well. 
For Van den Berg, a novel is a story that 
has too much to offer and a short story would 
not do it justice.

SPEAKER SERIES

By AMANDA CASE  

“The Jungle Book” is resurrected 
in the new action-packed 
blockbuster, which includes famous 
voices like Bill Murray, Scarlett 
Johansson, Christopher Walken and 
Lupita Nyong’o. 
Jon Favreau of “Iron Man” fame 
uses stunning computer-generated 
imagery to revive this classic tale 
by Rudyard Kipling, recreating the 
jungle animals we all knew so well.
For those of us who need a 
recap of the 1967 original movie: 
Mowgli, played by newcomer 
Neel Sethi, is a child who has been 
raised by wolves but finds out he 
is no longer welcome in the jungle 
by the menacing tiger Shere Khan. 
Having been harmed by man, 
Shere Khan promises to eliminate 
anyone he sees as a threat to the 
jungle. After abandoning the only 
home he’s ever known, Mowgli 
embarks on a journey to find 
humans, accompanied by Bagheera, 
a panther who has become his stern 
mentor. 
On his captivating voyage of self-
discovery and adventure, Mowgli 
encounters many jungle creatures 
including the free-spirited bear 
Baloo (Murray), seductive python 
Kaa (Johansson) and the persuasive 
orangutan King Louis (Walken). 
Some of these animals don’t have 
Mowgli’s best interests at heart and 
he finds this out through epic animal 
battles and suspenseful encounters. 
This live-action adaptation 
is much more dramatic than the 
original. There are moments of edgy 
violence and startling scares. Even 
the timeless tune “I Wanna Be Like 
You” comes at a tense time in the 
film, almost leaving the audience 
somewhat haunted.   
But even with all the action, the 
movie stays true to its Disney roots 
and maintains a light-hearted spirit 
with humor sprinkled in throughout. 

Some of the characters also offer 
a comfort that we’re used to from 
many Disney characters. 
The visuals are pretty mind-
blowing to say the least. The 
animals look very tangible, down 
to every last strand of fur. Their 
facial expressions are captured in 
a way that’s extremely realistic for 
animation. The entire movie was 
shot using motion capture and then 
the scenes were cut together. Using 
that footage, the effects team then 
built the film’s sets virtually. 
“Everything was mapped against 
the virtual sets,” Favreau told Wired 
Magazine. “We designed the sets 
like you would for a video game.”
The filming took place in a 
warehouse in Los Angeles while 
Sethi acted out the scenes on small 
sets created by the production 
designers. Other actors stood in 
for the animals and props and blue 
screens were also used during 
filming. Meticulous lighting was 
programmed to create particular 
shadows of the different animals as 
well. The creators definitely pushed 
filmmaking technology further than 
it’s ever gone before. 
Despite being created this way, 
similar to the methods used in 
“Avatar” (2009) and “Gravity” 
(2013), “The Jungle Book” 
appeared as if it was actually shot 
out in the jungle with real animals. 
It never seemed to be fake, only 
stunning. 
Since opening on April 15, the 
movie so far, has grossed over $300 
million worldwide and has become 
the highest grossing Hollywood 
release ever in India, with about 
$24.6 million since opening. The 
movie, which cost roughly $175 
million to make, continues to climb 
the Hollywood charts and is sure 
to pave the way for future Disney 
remakes.  

FILM REVIEW 
Dark twist for Disney


in the parking lot to show 
differentiation between the two areas.
Parking tickets at UAlbany are a 
big deal for college students who are 
often frustrated when a small piece of 
paper is left on their windshield with an 
amount they have to pay. 
To help student avoid tickets, Mass 
Transit offers a variety of source tables 
throughout campus with information 
as well as information on Uptown and 
Downtown campus parking through 
social media and its website. 
Jones said it is the student’s 
responsibility to understand the 
rules and regulations, although he 
understands that the information is 
not broadcasted properly and the 

department hopes to adjust signs. 
 Appeal citations are 
available for students online through 
MyUAlbany. Most students who 
appeal their tickets at the beginning 
of the semester have a high chance 
of succeeding, according to Jones. 
Appeals for tickets from Colonial Quad 
also have high success rates, since the 
signs are unclear.  
According to Jones, 90 percent 
of their customers enjoy the parking 
services, while the other 10 percent are 
dissatisfied due to tickets. 
It is common for vehicles to be 
parked closest to Washington Avenue 
because that is where the majority of 
traffic flows.
“The goal is to issue less citations, 
but if we didn’t do our job the way we 
do now, campus would be a mess,” 
Jones said.

renter to share a profile. With its 
“outstanding” reputation – roughly 
two million active listings – and a 
well-designed interface, Luca said that 
Airbnb is paving the way for room 
renting, generating over $25 billion 
since its creation in 2008.
Amanda Flood, a senior majoring 
in psychology, used Airbnb during her 
trip to Canada in March 2016. She said 
that her experience with the service 
was successful, but feels that with the 
results of Luca’s study, the potential 
discrimination between hosts and 
renters is a problem for the service’s 
customers. 
“If I got denied, I’d be upset because 
Airbnb is so affordable,” Flood said. 

“We’re in college, and we like Airbnb’s 
lower prices.”
Online marketplaces are changing the 
way in which customers buy services. 
One of Luca’s suggestions to reduce 
potential discrimination on Airbnb is 
to label discrimination illegal in the 
service’s terms and conditions. 
“My hope is that this paper will shed 
light on the implications of the choices 
market designers make,” Luca said. 
“My goal is to help online businesses to 
create a better - and fairer - society.”
Luca is currently an assistant 
professor of business administration 
at the Harvard Business School. 
According to the Harvard Business 
Schools’ website, he works closely with 
companies and cities, including Yelp, 
Facebook and the U.K., to help them 
become more data-driven.

LACROSSE 
DANES DEFEAT YALE 

By BENNETT DRAKE

This past week the 
men’s lacrosse team was 
lucky enough to play on 
Bob Ford Field at Tom 
and Mary Casey Stadium 
during the school’s annual 
“Spring Stomp.” The team 
always looks forward to 
these opportunities because 
of the atmosphere that 
comes with it, especially 
the 7 p.m. face-off under 
the lights. It seemed like 
Binghamton caught some 
of that big game energy 
as well and came out 
and matched us punch 
for punch all night long. 
On paper we knew we 
were the better team, but 
Binghamton made us prove 
it by not backing down at 
all. 

I think this was good for 
us because we had been 
playing just okay lacrosse 
up to this week and we 
needed a team to wake us 
up heading into Yale week.
As much fun as the 
atmosphere in Casey 
Stadium was last week, 
nothing can compare to 
the on-field energy at 
Reese Stadium during our 
top 10 matchup with the 
Yale Bulldogs this past 
Saturday in New Haven. 
We could have played this 
game out in a farmer’s 
field and I think it would 
have had the same energy 
and excitement that was 
brought by both teams. It 
was a game we have had 
circled on our schedule for 
a few weeks now because 
of the NCAA tournament 
implications that it holds 
for both teams. The win 
gave us what is called a 
“significant win” to add 
to our resume. This is the 
type of win that we were 
desperately in need of 
all year. The energy was 
present right from the 
pre-game as both teams 
were being vocal to each 
other in a classic SUNY 
versus Ivy way. There 
always seems to be an edge 
between us two for some 
strange reason. The game 
itself was best described 

as a “slugfest” with both 
teams going on mini 
scoring runs throughout the 
game. I thought it really 
showed how well we can 
play under pressure by not 
panicking during their runs 
and being able to answer 
right back with goals of our 
own. They carried all of the 
momentum into overtime 
because of their late goal, 
however the mood on the 
sideline never changed. 
I never felt like we were 
going to lose that game, 
and I believe the other 46 
guys felt the same way. We 
got two huge stops from 
Blaze in over time and one 
crazy outside shot from 
Seth, and that is all we 
needed to get the victory. 
Tuesday we are back 
in Casey Stadium to face 
our cross-town rival Siena. 
This game is always a fun 
one to play in because 
of how close both of the 
teams are together. Even 
though the Saints aren’t 
having their best season 
you cannot overlook them. 
Both teams know that this 
is a special game on the 
schedule. I am looking 
forward to getting back 
into the big stadium and 
playing in front of our fans 
for the last regular season 
home game of the year.

SOCCER  

By KIANA RUGER 
 
Last Friday, the University at 
Albany women’s soccer team had 
a game under the lights in Tom 
and Mary Casey Stadium against 
in-city rivals Siena College. 
Normally we would tackle this 
game as any other game against 
the Saints -- eager to play, 
anticipating a fight and expecting 
a win. Except, today, something 
was different. There was this new 
feeling --  a new drive in all of us 
that we never had before. 
As we waited for the first 
whistle to blow, we heard a 
5-year-old girl cheering her heart 
out among our fans. It was at that 
very moment that playing this 
game meant so much more.
Her name is Abby. We like to 
call her Amazing Abby, since it’s 
more fitting. Last year UAlbany 
women’s soccer proudly became 
a part of the program Friends 
of Jaclyn. The program allows 
sports team across the nation to 
“adopt” a child who is suffering 
from a chronic disease. This 
adoption allows the child to 
experience what it’s like to 
be a part of a sport and more 
importantly, part of a team. 

Last year we got the privilege 
of meeting Jaclyn, the inspiration 
for the foundation. This past 
week at our banquet we got to 
adopt Abby. 
As soon as we met her there 
was an instant connection. Abby 
is battling leukemia. You’d think 
all the therapy, hospital visits and 
battles she’s faced would bring 
her down, but Abby is quite the 
opposite. You would never be 
able to guess what this girl is 
going through. She has a bright, 
loving, carefree personality 
and is a stunning person on the 
outside as well. In fact, she’s way 
more of a people person than 
most of us, so we’re learning 
from her each day. 
Abby surprised us at our game 
and when we found out she 
was there, we all ran to her and 
gave her a big hug. She told us 
that she practiced how she was 
going to run up to us and we all 
complimented her on her Albany 
sweatshirt and number 10 jersey 
that the team gave her a week 
before. After our visit with Abby, 
it was time to focus on the game. 
As our coach gave her usual 
pregame talk, she said something 
that stuck with me. 

Sure we had fitness testing all 
week and were going into this 
game in a new formation, but 
Abby was there supporting us 
with a smile on her face as she’s 
battling leukemia. If she can do 
that, playing a 90 minute soccer 
game should be pretty easy. 
Unfortunately we didn’t get 
the result we were hoping for. 
We settled with a 1-1 tie with 
our lone goal coming from Cait 
Paltsios in the first five minutes 
and Siena’s goal coming in the 
last 10 minutes. On top of how 
awful it felt to not come out with 
a win, I was also concerned with 
how Abby would feel after the 
game. 
Sure enough her sparkling face 
came running to me and gave me 
a hug. She then made me race 
her. I could hardly get my legs to 
go after a long game, however I 
couldn’t turn down a race against 
Abby. Abby beat me in several 
full field races. 
The team couldn’t have asked 
for a more special person to 
adopt as a Great Dane.
