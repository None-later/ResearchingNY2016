The University at Albany announced 
last Wednesday that a $10 million 
grant awarded for training scholars in 
eliminating minority health disparities 
will establish an endowment that will 
remain with the institution forever. 
Unveiling the school’s largest grant 
yet from the National Institutes of 
Health (NIH), UAlbany outlined its 
plan to use the funds to create a system 
of ongoing scholarship to tackle the 
growing inequity found in health 
among minorities. 
The grant, which UAlbany President 
Robert J. Jones described as “highly 
competitive” and “prestigious,” allows 
the university to expand the existing 
Center for the Elimination of Minority 
Health Disparities (CEMHD), as well 
as establish a life-long program to fund 
research in the field.  
“It is set up as an endowment, which 
means it will continue to generate 
revenue and perpetuity,” Jones said. 
“This money will be here as long as the 
university is here.” 
Deans of six colleges within 
the university attended the event, 
underscoring the widespread impact 
the grant will have on the campus 
community. The transdiciplinary 
nature of the new program will allow 
for new and existing faculty and 
graduate students to focus and re-focus 
their attention on issues of racial health 
disparities. 
“The money will be used to expose 
faculty and students to state of the art 

knowledge, and recruit new graduate 
fellows who will become future 
experts in the field,” said the Dean 
of the Colleges of Arts and Sciences, 
Elga Wulfert. Speaking on behalf of 
the six deans involved in the initiative, 
Wulfert emphasized the collaborative 
effort involved in planning and 
properly utilizing a grant of this nature. 
Aligned with schools and 
organizations in the Capital Region, 
Jones had considerable support in 
obtaining the grant, which he hopes 
will help “solve some of societies most 
complex problems.” 
“This $10 million will fund 
initiatives to address a wide array 
of devastating challenges, inequity, 
and disparities in health outcomes 
among impoverished and minority 
communities,” Jones said. 
Jones further described the grant’s 
influence as having broad implications 
for communities beyond UAlbany. The 
university’s new research will rely on 
a cooperative relationship with local 
minority communities, many of which 
are in the City of Albany and Troy.      
“I am so excited about this 
partnership,” said Albany Mayor 
Kathy Sheehan. “UAlbany and the 
City of Albany are leading the nation 
in this, and I look forward to our 
continued collective impact together.”
Sheehan, who announced an equity 
agenda upon taking office, noted that 
it is crucial to take into account issues 
of racial disparity and social justice 
before making decisions about how to 
allocate resources in the community. 

The university became aware of this 
unusual grant in the spring of 2015, 
and worked diligently for the award. 
Eligibility for the funds required that 
the university maintain its status as a 
National Institute on Minority Health 
and Health Disparities (NIMHD) 
center, overseen by the NIH. 
Prior to the discovery of the grant, 
the program now receiving the funds, 
CEMHD, was slated to close. In an 
effort to remain a NIMHD center, 
UAlbany re-funded the closing-
campus program prior to applying 
for the grant, said UAlbany’s Vice 
President for Research, James Dias. 
If all goes as planned UAlbany 
could receive an additional $10 
million in grant money in the next six 
years, making this grant worth $20 
million. The NIH will be looking for 
the university to provide 10 trained 
minority health scholars by the end of 
the six-year period, said Dias. 
Aside from leveraging the current 
grant to obtain additional funding 
for research and implementation, the 
university hopes that the money will 
allow for the diversification of the 
schools graduate program. Currently, 
minorities account for 39.9 percent of 
the undergraduate population, while 
only accounting for 16.9 percent 
among graduate students. 
The university hopes this grant 
will allow them to close this gap, 
by recruiting and training graduate 
students from minority and 
underrepresented populations. 

RESEARCH
UALBANY AWARDED $10M

By LINDSEY RIBACK

Cancer and inflammation 
were the topic of 
conversation as Albany 
residents and University at 
Albany faculty and students 
gathered at the East Campus 
on Thursday night for the 
Seventh Annual Hogarty 
Family Foundation Lecture. 
Mark Nelson, a 
professor in the University 
of Arizona’s Pathology 
Department, was honored 
as the Hogarty lecturer for 
this year and presented 
his research titled “RAGE 
against the cell: Insights 
into how inflammation fuels 
cancer progression,” which 
focused on colon cancer.  
“This is a topic that hits 
close to home to many of us 
in this room, as well as other 
members of our community,” 
said Director of the Cancer 
Research Center, Martin 
Tenniswood, who went on 
to mention UAlbany’s own 
Peter Hooley. 
Hooley, who led 
UAlbany’s men’s basketball 
team to victory last year 
just weeks after his mother 
passed away from colon 
cancer, released a public 
service announcement this 
past March in conjunction 
with UAlbany, the New 
York State Department of 
Health and the American 
Cancer Society for Colon 
Cancer Awareness Month.
According to Nelson, 

colon cancer is the third 
most common cancer among 
both men and women in 
the United States, and a 
significant number of people 
lose their battle to this 
disease each year. 
The Hogarty honoree 
said that while the number 
of colon cancer cases is 
decreasing for men and 
women overall, the rate of 
this type of cancer among 
African Americans is 
still very high, even after 
controlling for differences 
in socioeconomic status and 
access to screening methods. 
He said that this indicates 
“there can be something 
still biologically different or 
lifestyle differences between 
races that keep this rate high 
and leads to disparity.”
Nelson, who received 
his Bachelor of Science 
and Ph.D. in toxicology 
and pharmacology from 
Washington State University, 
warned his audience that 
while there is a genetic 
predisposition to developing 
colon cancer, it is lifestyle 
activities and behavioral 
choices that can accelerate 
disease progression.
He explained that these 
risk factors include a lack of 
physical activity, diets low 
in fruit and vegetables, high 
in fat and low in fiber, high 
alcohol consumption and 
tobacco use.

LECTURE
Discussion on 
cancer research

ALBANY
Catching up with Ricky Styxx

Please see CANCER page 2

By NICK MUSCAVAGE

The rhythmic tick of drum sticks 
echoes through the streets of downtown 
Albany. The man behind the beat is 
Ricky Styxx, a native to the city who 
grew up on Western Avenue and Gar-
den Street and is now in his early 60s. 
He was the second oldest of four 
siblings, and had an upbringing like any 
other kid, he said. Even when liquor 
came into the picture, when he became 
an alcoholic at age 13, it did not affect 
his close-knit family.
Now, Styxx weeps for these streets 
and the lives lost on them, too. He can 
feel the pain of the people who live out 
on them as well. It brings tears to his 
eyes just thinking about it. 
“I care. I’m sick of hearing the bad 
news. It’s not fair,” he said with a lump 
in his throat.

He has seen the streets grow old and 
change over time just as he has. They 
grew up together, in some ways, and 
spent a lot of time together, even though 
he has not always lived in the nomadic 
style in which he does now.
He is a figure who has been shrouded 
in legend in the college community for 
years. Students recognize him when 
he is pushing his cart down the street. 
When he starts drumming, they may 
yell out, “Yeah Ricky! Go, Ricky!” and 
then chat with him for a minute or two. 
“I love them,” he said of the college 
students. 
There have been videos of Styxx 
filmed by students and uploaded to 
YouTube, such as the one of him drum-
ming near the stage at Tulip Fest in 
Albany in 2012. There is one of Styxx 
dancing against a group of students on 
the corner of Quail and Western, a cor-

ner he frequents that is in the center of 
the student housing area. In the video, 
everyone seems to be laughing and hav-
ing a great time.
However if the people filming were 
to spend a day with this iconic figure, 
they would find that his life is not 
exactly how it is portrayed in the videos.
One thing in the videos is true: the 
drumming. 
“I love drumming,” he said, and ex-
plained that he began playing when he 
was 10 years old, back when he lived in 
his childhood home on Western Avenue 
and Garden Street. He attributed much 
of his influence to Floyd Sneed from 
Three Dog Night.
Now, when he is not sleeping on the 
couch in his sister Tammy’s basement 
in Slingerlands, he said he spends most

Where else to 
study for finals

OFF-CAMPUS

By REECE WILLIAMS

Finals are right around the 
corner and panic is setting in. 
“Finals week?” said 
University at Albany senior, 
Ominayzha Alexander. 
“It’s stressing me out,” 
she said on Thursday, with 
still eight days left before 
the first exams are to be 
administered. “And it’s 
always way too close to the 
end of classes. We need a 
break in-between.” 
What future changes the 
school has planned for finals 
week scheduling—if any—
are unknown. But what’s 
important right now is that 
you make sure that you’re 
prepared for this semester’s 
exams. If you’re looking to 
maximize study time, and 
minimize distractions, here’s 
a tip: get off campus. 
The University Library 
is sure to be crammed 
with students; the air 
of desperation from 
possibly 16 weeks worth 
of procrastination will be 
unavoidable. “Club Libby,” 
the allegedly quiet study 
area on the third floor, is not 
a place condusive to saving 
your grades.  

The benefit of studying 
off campus is that you 
don’t have to worry about 
fraternizing with friends 
who are not as focused as 
you. Where should you go? 
Here are three options I 
recommend:

Psychedelicatessen
275 River St, Troy, NY 
12180

Of the three, 
Psychedelicatessen is the 
furthest from campus; but the 
trip is well worth it. It’s as 
cool as it sounds.
A cattle bell above the 
door rings to let who ever is 
behind the counter know that 
someone has walked in, so 
you don’t have to awkwardly 
try to get anyone’s attention. 
New York-style bagels are 
for sale, as are Cider Belly 
doughnuts. Enjoy one, or 
the other (or, order a one of 
the gourmet sandwiches on 
a bagel) with a 16, or 20oz. 
cup of coffee—$2.25, and 
$4.50 respectively. 
The shop houses seven 
tables varying in size 
throughout the spacious

After listing the risk 
factors associated with colon 
cancer, Nelson appropriately 
used Mark Twain’s quote, 
“the only way to keep your 
health is to eat what you 
don’t want, drink what you 
don’t like, and do what you’d 
rather not.”
“As we become young 
adults we develop our 
lifestyle habits. We need to 
develop healthy habits early 
on so that we can remain 
healthy later on in life,” said 
Heather Sabo, a sophomore 
biology major who works in 
Douglas Conklin’s cancer 
research lab on the East 
Campus. “With cancer, for 
the most part, you really have 
to start watching what you 
eat and do around the age of 
forty.”

Aside from cutting out 
these life choices that 
increase risk for colon 
cancer, Nelson mentioned 
screening as beneficial. 
According to the Centers 
for Disease Control 
and Prevention, it is 
recommended that everyone 
between the ages of 50 and 
75 receive a colonoscopy 
every 10 years. Those 
with inflammatory bowel 
disease or colon polyps 
may be encouraged by their 
physicians to be screened 
earlier than 50 years old. 
This lecture came 
just a day after UAlbany 
announced that with the help 
of a $10 million National 
Institute of Health (NIH) 
grant, the university’s 
Center for the Elimination of 
Minority Health Disparities 
(CEMHD) will begin 
research to address health 
disparities in the northeast 
region of the country.

of his time 
roaming the 
streets from 
Western to 
Central, to 
Jay Street to 
Delaware Avenue.
   He only lives in the basement when he 
wants to, and explained that it is comfortable. 
“I’ve got a nice couch and TV. I’m all set,” 
he said.
On other nights, he spends his time 
at Delaware Park on Delaware Avenue 
where he checks in on his friend who he 
calls Bam-Bam, a homeless woman who 
struggles with mental illness that he has 
known for two years. Bam-Bam, who is of 
Indian background, is not in good shape, he 
explained.
 “We put in her Albany Med every other 
night,” Styxx said, adding that Bam-Bam has 
been to Albany Medical Center around nine 

times last year alone.
“I help the homeless,” he said, adding that 
he would give them the clothes off his back.
Styxx, who has been admitted to Albany 
Medical Center himself, can relate to Bam-
Bam. He said he is a chronic alcoholic and 
started drinking at 13 “just because it was 
there.”
He keeps Bam-Bam company and plays 
his rhythms for her by drumming his sticks 
on the handle of his shopping cart.
When he thinks about homelessness, he 
said, “I never get mad, I get sad.” He got 
sad when he talked about his only marriage, 
too. It was nearly 40 years ago, to a woman 
named Kim.
She convinced him to stop drumming 
and leave his band to prove he was devoted 
to their marriage. “She said, ‘Ricky, give 
up your drums, give up your band, and I’ll 
marry you.” So he did. Not long after that, he 
received news that she had aborted their child 

and was with another man.
With tears in his eyes, he said, “How could 
your girlfriend do that you?”
Since then, he has been focusing on 
cleaning up Albany. He said he considers 
himself a protector of the homeless, kids and 
college students. Violence and crime break 
his heart and he will do anything to help stop 
it. 
“I’m not going to let them hurt them 
no more,” he said. “But I’m just one in a 
million.”
“I can’t stop it,” he said in a weary voice. 
His voice was cracked and hoarse, a reminder 
of a life riddled with alcohol and drug abuse. 
He used to huff glue and smoke crack, but 
quit years ago because he was growing 
too old. He sticks to beer and liquor now. 
Milwaukee’s Best is his favorite brew. At the 
time of the interview, he sipped on a mixture 
of Skol Vodka, beer and pineapple juice.
He took in a deep breath and then began to 

cry. “I’m sorry to cry,” he said. He continued, 
“I’m sick of these motherfuckers running up 
with a gun and a knife and saying ‘Give me 
your shit.’”
He said Albany police think that just 
because he pushes a shopping cart that he is 
“just a homeless drunk.”
He is treated like “a goddam derelict,” he 
said while lighting a Black and Mild cigar, 
but he cares about the lives of the people just 
as much as the police do.
He thinks that the police and Albany 
County District Attorney David Soares are 
doing the best they can. He also mentioned 
Charlie Muller, the head pastor of Victory 
Church who tries to stop gun-violence by 
offering a gun buyback program. Styxx hopes 
to offer help in any way he can to them.
“I want to keep these guys and gals safe. 
It’s about being safe.” He continued, “I’ll stay 
in Albany. It’s where I grew up, it’s what I 
know.”

tables are big enough for group study, or a 
really busy single study party.
But the best part of Psychedelicatessen is 
hiding around the corner. 
To the right of the main kitchen area is 
a living room, outfitted with plush, suede 
couches, and armchairs. There’s even a green 
bedrest pillow awaiting your recline in the 
window sill.
Most days, the shop—which is open 5 a.m. 
– 10  p.m. Monday-Friday, and 6 a.m. – 9 
p.m. Saturday-Sunday—is pretty quiet; seats 
are aplenty. 
But even after classes at nearby Russell 
Sage College and Rensselaer Polytechnic 
Institute let out—around 4 p.m. on week 
days—distractions are minimal; everyone is 
working. If it’s too crowded, sit outside. The 
Wi-Fi is strong, and the locals won’t bother 
you. 
Parking is generally hassle-free; there’s 
almost always a wspot on the street only steps 
from the door.
Need a study break? A unique mix 
featuring the sounds of Jimi, Bob Marley, and 
Collie Buddz dances through the speakers. 
So don’t worry, about a thing; because every 
little thing, is gonna’ be alright. 

The Daily Grind
204 Lark St. #1, Albany, NY 12210

While many students prefer to be all 
hipster, and passive-aggressively fight for 
a seat inside of Stacks Espresso Bar, you 
might find it more peaceful a few steps down 
the street, toward Washington, at The Daily 
Grind. 

The space downstairs is a little tight, but 
grab a cup of what some say to be the best 
coffee in Albany, and head upstairs to the 
retail shop. There’s a couch, plenty of chairs, 
and two tables (if you’re not working on a 
laptop). The one in the windowsill is great 
place to people watch, as you find inspiration 
to write that paper that you should’ve started 
two weeks ago. 
The lounge is often empty, and the tunes 
are quiet. 
But the best part about The Daily Grind 
is the coffee. And you’re catching them at a 
particularly good time, as they’ve recently 
released their newest and strongest coffee to 
date: DEATH BY COFFEE. As the t-shirts 
for sale read: “Friends don’t let friends drink 
Starbucks.”
Parking on Lark can sometimes be a pain, 
so maybe you should take the 12, 10, 114, 
or any bus that runs down Washington, or 
Western. 
The shop is open Monday-Saturday, 7 a.m. 
– 8 p.m., and Sunday, 7 a.m. – 7 p.m.

Arbor Hill/West Hill Branch of the Albany 
Public Library 
148 Henry Johnson Blvd, Albany, NY 12210

If you really want to get away from the 
student body, but remain local, head to the 
nearby Arbor Hill/West Hill branch of the 
Albany Public Library. 
No coffee or snacks for sale here, but there 
is plenty of space inside the 12,000 square-
foot area to stretch out and study, as well as 
three, small group study rooms. 
There isn’t any background music, as it 
is a library; but, the quiet giggle of young 
children serves as a sufficient offset for those 
opposed to absolute silence. 
Around 4 p.m. on week days, fourth and 
fifth graders come to read, play with Legos, 

and log on to “Whyville,” which, if you don’t 
remember, is a juvenile version of social 
networking. 
Maybe take a short study break and read to 
little, willing listeners; it’ll make your whole 
day to bring literary joy to little ears. Then 
let them know that you’ve got some studying 

to finish, and, if there’s enough time, you’ll 
watch that cat video. 
Parking is available alongside the library, 
which is open Monday and Wednesday, 10 
a.m. – 6 p.m., Tuesday and Thursday, 12 
p.m. – 5 p.m., Friday, 12 p.m. – 6 p.m., and 
Saturday, 12 p.m. – 5 p.m.

I’m not sure how to begin, 
so I guess I’ll start at square 
one. I joined the ASP the first 
semester of my sophomore 
year writing movie and TV 
show reviews for A&E. From 
there, I became an assistant and 
eventually head editor of the 
section. The ASP has given me 
so many amazing opportunities, 
from covering local concerts in 
Albany to interviewing an erotic 
science fiction novelist (yes, that 
actually happened!).
It’s hard to believe that this 
will be my final issue. For 
nearly three years, I’ve been 
fortunate enough to be a part 
of this staff of highly dedicated 
writers and editors, and it’s been 
an incredible experience.
I’ll leave off with this: in the 
words for Ferris Bueller, “Life 
moves pretty fast. If you don’t 
stop and look around once in a 
while, you could miss it.” Peace 
out, ASP. It’s been a blast.

ALBANY STUDENT PRESS EDITORS SAY GOODBYE

By MADELINE ST. AMOUR

The Albany Student Press 
has been the centerpiece of my 
University at Albany experience. 
I was lucky enough to realize 
what I wanted to do with my life 
shortly after I transferred here, 
so I joined the ASP to pursue my 
dream: journalism.
Working as managing 
editor has been one of the best 
experiences I’ve had so far. I’ve 
met a lot of people, covered a 
variety of stories and learned 
a lot about management and 
reporting. I’ve grown not only as 
a reporter and editor, but also as 
a person. 
The ASP has seen a lot of 
changes this year. With a new 
design, a new website and a lot 
of new staff, it feels like it’s 
a good time to move on from 
this adventure. Good luck to 
the new staff, and thank you for 
everything you’ve given me, 
ASP.

My relationship with the Albany 
Student Press has been one of the 
most significant in my life. I’ve been 
with the Albany Student Press since 
I was a freshman, and it’s consumed 
my entire life for a long, long time. 
I started as a writer then I worked 
my way up the ladder and ended my 
ASP career as Editor-in-Chief.
 It’s very difficult to put into 
words the feeling that comes with 
letting go of something that has been 
a backbone in my life for so long. 
Even though running this paper has 
been a hugely heavy responsibility, 
it’s made my life comfortable. It’s 
been the love of my life for years.
I used to love the ASP because 
it was a place where I could further 
myself and publish my own writing. 
This year I was able to take a step 
back and realize that the value of this 
paper goes so much deeper than that.
   There are a lot of people who 
don’t have the chance to have their 
voice heard, but the ASP gives them 
that opportunity. It has taught me 
to treat everyone equally, and to 
valwwue all ideas, regardless of my 
personal opinion.
The ASP has never been just a 
newspaper for me. It’s hovered in 
my life like some otherworldly, 
guiding force that I’ve been lucky to 
be involved with. Deep down I know 
I’m ready to leave, but even though 
I’m not quite ready to come to terms 
with the fact that it’ll continue to run 
without me, I’m incredibly grateful 
that’ll it’ll still be around other 
people to learn from and to love.

If I had to go back and 
review my time with the ASP, I 
cannot see myself doing it any 
other way.
My freshman year I knew 
that I wanted to write and 
that the ASP was around but I 
hadn’t found the courage to talk 
to the Editor-in- Chief about 
writing for the paper.
Nevertheless, I found a place 
in the Arts and Entertainment 
section, sending 500-word short 
stories in my sophomore year, 
and I got my first piece printed.
As an English major, I had 
already mastered MLA format, 
but AP style was a whole new 
playing field.
I wrote my first article, 
“When the Griffins meet 
the Simpsons” for the A&E 
section.
From there, I covered TV 
shows, movies, plays, comedy 
shows and more.
I became the opinions editor 
with my first article about 
Beyoncé not being a feminist.
And it’s been great ever 
since.
Goodbye ASP!

I’ve been playing soccer 
and writing for the same 
period of time now. The way 
the two have intersected 
for me at the University 
at Albany is something I 
will never forget. It’s as 
if my two favorite things, 
the feeling of being part 
of a team and playing for 
something bigger than 
myself, was the same 
experience while writing and 
editing for the ASP. 
We all had to show up-- 
we were sweaty, we were 
over caffeinated, but we 
always got the job done-
-together. I will forever 
treasure my experience as 
sports editor. 
I never knew I could do 
both in college-- however, I 
can honestly say I belong to 
two teams now. Thank you! 

THANK 
YOU

for reading the ASP this year. 
See you in the fall!

TRADITION. INNOVATION. EXCELLENCE.

By KEVIN MERCADO

The University at Albany has had quite the 
year full of ups and downs. The question at 
hand is whether the good outweighed the bad.
UAlbany has been featured in the news, 
for better or for worse, several times this 
academic year. We can start with the most 
scandalous story that I’ve heard in my four 
years on this campus: the infamous CDTA 
bus incident. 
We all remember the story of the three 
women who cried hate crime, claiming 
they were attacked by a group of 10 white 
students because of the color of their skin. 
The incident was certainly well-known, 
as presidential candidate Hillary Clinton 
managed to chime in.
Finding out that the story was proven false 
based on investigations was a pretty hard 
blow. However, the university acted fast 
on the matter sending out several e-mails 
explaining the ongoing investigation. 
The students on campus moved fast after 
the accusation, rallying together days after the 
event turning out hundreds of students by the 
Campus Center. The message was clear: we 
will not stand for crimes against race, color, 
or ethnicity. 
“We had to go with the information 
that we had at hand. We had to respond,’ 
UAlbany President Robert J. Jones said, 

remarking on his response to the event. “The 
community wanted to know, wanted to hear 
from me about what happened. We felt it was 
our responsibility to remind the community 
of our values.” 
In better news, UAlbany has established 
the Blackstone Launchpad on campus. This 
program is designed to help pioneer students’ 
ideas of creative business plans and make 
them into a reality.
Blackstone is spending $4.5 million 
over three years to establish LaunchPad at 
UAlbany in addition to Cornell University, 
New York University, Syracuse University 
and the University at Buffalo. This program 
is not limited to just students in the business 
department and will allow all students to 
market his or her own interests and ideas 
offering everyone a chance to become an 
entrepreneur. Though it is still in its inaugural 
year here at the university, the Blackstone 
Launchpad could have some promise for 
students at UAlbany.
A recent story from the Times Union by 
Claire Hughes said, “A $10 million federal 
grant will enable the University at Albany to 
train and hire researchers working to reduce 
health disparities in minority communities.”
The university is now making strides in 
trying to solve major health issues and also is 
adopting an atmosphere of inclusivity.
“The endowment will allow the university 
to train graduate students and faculty to 

conduct research that considers minority 
health disparities, Jones said. University 
officials hope to attract more black, Hispanic, 
Native American and other minority faculty 
with the designation,” Hughes wrote.
The university also wants to help reduce 
the amount of sexual assaults on campus. 
According to a statistic found by Albany 
Student Press writer, Lindsay Riback, sexual 
assault reports have gone up by 200 percent. 
“I know it sounds crazy to say, but we 
want reports to go up,” said Chantelle Cleary, 
UAlbany’s Title IX Coordinator. “We know 
it is happening and if it’s not being reported 
to us, we are not getting services to these 
people who have had these experiences.”
 Students are becoming more open to talk 
about sexual assault to whatever degree and 
finding ways to prevent it from happening to 
the next generation of college students.
This story brings me to my last landmark 
in this academic year.
Recently, the university’s independently 
run newspaper, the Albany Student Press, 
was hit by censorship when a Tour Guide 
supervisor decided to hide newspaper 
with the headline, “Sexual assault reports 
up 200 percent at UAlbany” because the 
word ‘assault’ would promote the school 
in a negative way. As the ASP has already 
addressed that story, I will not harp on it 
further, but I will say that it looks more 
negative for the University to hide papers 

than the word ‘assault.’ The university did act 
fast in retrieving the lost papers and getting 
them back on stands.
It is clear that the university as a whole 
knows what kind of image it wants and 
sometimes it is favorable to students. 
Nevertheless, the university has been in the 
news more times this year than I have ever 
seen it in four years of being a member of this 
campus community. 
To say the least, UAlbany has had quite a 
year.

Andrew Jackson, known more 
for his persecution of Native 
Americans and slaveholding 
practices than for his involvement 
during the Battle of New Orleans, 
is being replaced on the new $20 
bill. Maintaining his status as the 
face of the $20 bill since 1928, 
there are now plans to remove 
Jackson from the bill to replace 
him with Harriet Tubman.
Treasury Secretary Jacob 
L. Lew announced that by 
2020 Tubman’s portrait will 
take over the bill. President 
Obama welcomed the change 
and many consider it to be a 
quintessential movement into 
adopting a multiracial and 
multicultural acceptance during 
an underrepresented diverse 
part of history. Even Republican 
Presidential hopeful Donald 
Trump threw his acknowledged 
the change’s importance.
Of course, this did not come 
without controversy. Many were 
quick to declare that Tubman was 
oppressed by the very system that 
created our economy. Just a few 
years ago it was almost decided 
that Alexander Hamilton’s 
spot on the $10 bill was to be 
replaced. Let’s start off by saying 
that the person who played a 
substantial part in creating our 
current financial system and 
currency should never be taken 
off said currency; however, one 
has to acknowledge that black 
and women history is very much 
a part of American history, and 
still continues to be. Through 
the use of our currency, we can 
continue to recognize a specific 
part of history and remember it is 
still relevant. 
Harriet Tubman, who aided 

more than 300 slaves on their 
journey to freedom, was pivotal 
in the abolitionist movement. Her 
involvement in spying for the 
Union army and her continuous 
effort to bring about freedom 
to those in need— even putting 
her life in harm’s way to do 
so— makes her deserving of all 
the praise she receives in books, 
movies, and awards named after 
her. However, I can’t help but 
imagine other powerful figures in 
American history who can take 
her place on the $20 bill.
This is so much more of an 
improvement on the efforts of 
Civil Rights and other African 
American movements, such as 
the current Black Lives Matter, 
than any of the other movements 
to take place in American history. 
Such historical figures as Martin 
Luther King Jr. or Frederick 
Douglass are prime examples 
of people who’ve persevered 
through segregation, not only 
becoming incredibly well 
educated, but also devoting much 
of their careers to educating 
others within the community. 
However, Tubman would 
be the first woman to be put on 
paper currency since Martha 
Washington’s portrait briefly 
graced the $1 silver certificate in 
the late 19th century.
Interestingly, the $20 bill is 
not the only one to change. Other 
bills like the $5 bill will continue 
to have Abraham Lincoln 
as its main portrait, but will 
acknowledge others on the back. 
By 2020 Martin Luther King, 
Jr. and Eleanor Roosevelt will 
make appearances on these 
bills in order to further educate 
the importance of a variety of 
movements that have taken place 
in history. 

Changing the $20 billMentally ill students in college

COLLEGE LIFE

By AMANDA ZIEGLER-IANNOTTI
T

heir entire lives may 
lie ahead of them, but 
sometimes college 
students can feel that 
ending their lives is the only way 
to end their problems. New Paltz 
student Thomas O’Rourke must 
have felt that way. 
He grew up in East Northport, 
Long Island. He was described 
by friends as one of the most 
creative, kindhearted, and 
charismatic souls around. 
Countless people were affected 
by his suicide. They posted 
stories of quirky things he used 
to say or do. For instance, his 
favorite joke was “So, two 
elephants are in a bathtub. One 
elephant says, ‘Pass the soap.’ 
The other elephant says, “No 
soap…Radio!,” which his 
friend Meghan Prchal described 
as simple, nonsensical, yet 
hilarious.
College suicide has tripled 
since the 1950s.  The total 
number of college students 
that commit suicide per year 
is currently 1,100. This rise in 
suicide has caused families, 
college administrators, and 
doctors to reevaluate whether 
there is enough support and 
options available to mentally ill 
college students.  
University at Albany students 
can go to the Counseling Center, 
located on Patroon Creek 
Boulevard, with general mental 
health concerns or in extreme 
crisis. It doesn’t prescribe 
medication, but it does refer 
students to nearby prescribers. 
“The number of visits a 
student can have is not limited 
and counseling services are 
paid for by the student fees,” 

said Dr. Sarah Nolan, a licensed 
psychologist at UAlbany. 
Nolan said she believes 
that “the most important thing 
the center does for students is 
provide them with someone to 
listen…many students tend to 
feel like nobody cares or pays 
attention to them.“ 
Carlea Walker, a UAlbany 
student who has been to the 
Counseling Center, said, “The 
availability there is really 
limited. Like, obviously if 
you’re having an emergency 
they can usually get you in, but 
since it’s free, a lot of students 
take advantage of it.”
She wished she could see a 
counselor on a more regular 
schedule, but found it hard 
to both obtain and fit an 
appointment in her schedule. 
Therapist and Adelphi 
University Professor LuAnn 
Quackenbush explained that not 
enough is being done for the 
students suffering with mental 
illnesses. 
“Let’s compare it to a person 
that has a learning disability,” 
she said. “We have special 
services for them, and we don’t 
yet have special services for 
students that have mental health 
issues. If we’re going to respect 
the fact that people have learning 
disabilities, we have to respect 
the fact that some students have 
psychiatric disabilities.”
Quackenbush stressed that 
not all of the responsibility 
can fall on the schools to aid 
mentally ill students; the parents 
and the students need to play 
a role in helping out. The real 
trouble might be that schools 
have no record of combating 
mental illness and no policy that 
explicitly mentions it. 

The most important thing 
is that professors need to be 
more understanding and better 
educated on mental illness, 
opening the metaphorical 
door for communication 
with struggling students, 
because many won’t take it 
upon themselves to initiate 
conversation, Quackenbush said. 
College is described often 
as “the best four years of your 
life,” and for many, that’s 
absolutely true. Friendships are 
forged, knowledge is acquired, 
and countless hours are spent 
getting to know who you are. 
However, for others, these 
four years are spent in torture. 
Sleeping patterns, eating habits, 
ability to focus, desire for 
relationships with other people, 
among others, can be affected by 
mental illness. The stress from 
classes can exacerbate it. Many 
students who previously had a 
manageable mental illness have 
a high chance of going into crisis 
mode.
1,100 students take their 
lives every year. This could 
be prevented, if they had more 
support options available.
College supposedly provides 
students with a degree, setting 
them up for the rest of their 
lives. But for many, college 
makes it difficult for them to 
want the rest of their lives to 
happen. For those suffering with 
mental illness, it’s important to 
remember that your life matters 
to many, regardless of how you 
feel. If you are suffering, please 
reach out, and don’t be afraid.
Counseling Center hours are 
Monday through Friday, 9 a.m. 
to 4:30 p.m. The phone number 
is 518-442-5800.

In 2006, Kentucky natives Matt Shultz, Brad Shultz, 
Jared Champion, Daniel Tichenor, and Lincoln Parish 
came together to form the American alternative rock 
band Cage the Elephant. Ten years, four albums, and one 
Grammy nomination later, the band is gearing up to tour 
North America this summer to promote their new album, 
“Tell Me I’m Pretty.” Along the way, Cage the Elephant 
will be rocking the Times Union Center in Downtown 
Albany on Wednesday, May 11.
In an interview with the Albany Student Press, Cage 
the Elephant vocalist Matt Shultz described the band’s 
early years and formation of their members. 
“Me and Brad, our guitarist, are brothers, so we were 
always playing together growing up,” said Shultz. “We 
had known Daniel Tichenor because his father and my 
father used to play in the same folk-singer-songwriter 
circle when we were growing up…We met Jared in high 
school and started a different band, that was our high 
school band, but some of the other members left to pursue 
school further. That’s when Daniel joined, and Lincoln as 
well. That’s kind of how it took shape.”
Influenced by bands and musicians including David 
Bowie, The Beatles, Pixies, and Talking Heads, Cage 
the Elephant’s style has encompassed sounds from 
alternative, punk, blues, and indie rock. The band’s latest 
single, “Mess Around,” ranked as Cage the Elephant’s 
sixth Billboard Alternative number one spot. The title has 
likened the group amongst heavy hitters including Red 
Hot Chili Peppers, Linkin Park, Foo Fighters, Green Day, 
R.E.M, and U2 as one of seven bands to hold more than 
five number one singles on the Alternative chart.
At the beginning of their career the band moved to 
London, where they released their self-titled debut 
album “Cage the Elephant” in 2008. The album’s single 
“Ain’t No Rest for the Wicked” launched the band onto 
mainstream radio airwaves, reaching number three on 
the Alternative songs chart in the U.S. and number 83 on 
Billboard Top 100.
Cage the Elephant’s sophomore album in 2011, “Thank 
You, Happy Birthday,” spawned the single “Shake Me 
Down,” claiming number one on both US Billboard Rock 
and Alternative Songs and earning a nomination for Best 
Rock Video at the 2011 MTV Music Awards.
The release of the band’s third album again led to 
number one charting singles. “Melophobia,” released 
in 2013, had success with songs “Come a Little Closer” 
and “Cigarette Daydreams.” The album earned Cage 
the Elephant a Grammy nomination in 2015 for Best 

Alternative Music Album.
Ten years after their formation, Cage the Elephant is 
back and better than ever in 2016. Their fourth album 
“Tell Me I’m Pretty,” has launched the band with its sixth 
number one single and a national summer tour.
In addition, “Tell Me I’m Pretty” comes with a new 
twist. Dan Auerbach, guitarist and vocalist of the award-
winning rock band The Black Keys, produced the album, 
helping with creative contributions during recording.
“Dan has the incredible ability to go on his first 
instinct…he’s like a musical encyclopedia” said Shultz. 
“We would cut a track, and then once we cut it he’d have 
everyone come into the control room and we’d just spin 
records…Once we were all vibing on different things, 
maybe it was a baseline that stood out, or a beat, we’d 
say ‘Alright let’s cut this song again.’ And whether it 
changed the song in composition or completely in feel, it 
definitely changed the spirit. It was a really great learning 
experience.”

“Tell Me I’m Pretty” has received positive reviews 
by critics. Rolling Stone claimed the album as “their 
best yet – melodically taut garage rock with psychedelic 
flourishes and a fighting edge.”
“It’s a much rawer record than we’ve ever made 
before,” said Shultz. “There are definitely a lot of 
elements of toning the beat back…It holds much of the 
same intensity that we had in the past but is restrained.”
Shultz encourages aspiring musicians to work hard at 
what they love.
“Play as much as you possibly can…and write as much 
as you can,” said Shultz.
This summer on tour, these “caged elephants” are 
being let loose. Cage the Elephant will make their way to 
cities including New York, Nashville, Los Angeles, and 
dozens of others while on tour. On May 11, the elephants 
will rock Albany in a performance that’s sure to be 
unforgettable.

AWARD CEREMONY 

By DIEGO CAGARA 

Three confident University at Albany students proved 
that words alone were powerful enough to reduce an 
audience into sobs and laughter, each reading a captivating 
story during the second annual Writing and Critical 
Inquiry Essay Contest on Apr. 27 at the Campus Center 
Assembly Hall.
WCI lecturer Amanda Girraca and secretary Kimberly 
Nava were among those who helped organize the event to 
recognize students’ writing and congratulate their bravery 
to share their essays with a crowd mostly comprised of 
strangers. The contest was also a way to involve students 
outside the classroom.
“Last year, [I] randomly liked the idea of a writing 
contest,” said Girraca. “I got a crew of three other 
professors and together decided on this model of collecting 
essays and it was a way of celebrating student writing.”
Prior to the event, students who took the WCI class 
(UUNI 110) had to pen essays and encouraged to 
voluntarily submit them into the contest. Nine WCI 
professors read the entries and judged which should go on 
in terms of writing quality and reader impact. Afterwards, 
the approved entries were judged by actual WCI students 
in the spring semester who discussed which should be 
the finalists and winners for three categories: Personal, 
Analysis and Argument/Conversation.
The event unexpectedly began on an emotional route as 
student Ashley May’s story poignantly revolved around 
her mother’s battle with lupus which caused members 
of the audience to choke in tears, their weeping barely 
suppressed. Her essay, “Goodbye Blue Sky,” won the 
Personal Essay category.
“I hope that she dies knowing how strongly her memory 
will live on in all that she comes to know,” she concluded 
her piece, pausing intermittently throughout to compose 
herself while her family, including her mother, sat in 
the front row, also touched. “I hope I get a chance to say 
goodbye, I hope one day she will find peace…I hope she 
feels loved, she is loved. What a wonderful, beautiful 
woman and what a tragedy: my mom is dying and there’s 
nothing I can do about it.”
After a cathartic applause as May’s family embraced, 

Kendra Baxter came up and read “Modern Day 
Factories” which won the Analysis category by providing 
constructive commentary on the American public school 
system. She wrote about author and former school teacher 
John Taylor Gatto’s argument that the public education’s 
rigorous timeline—five days a week, sitting in classrooms 
for 12 years—is like a “factory employee from the 
Industrial [Revolution].” Her essay further criticized 
public schools for being “deliberately designed to produce 
mediocre intellects…and to ensure docile and incomplete 
citizens.”
Scarlet Brown’s “Obscene Kayaks and Violent 
Pornography: Censorship in Japan” piece discussed the 
hypocrisy of censorship standards there, winning the 
Argument/Conversation category. Her insightful critique 
concerned a Japanese artist, Megumi Igarashi, who was 
arrested for “distributing the 3D printer code for how to 
print a kayak in the form of the artist’s vagina” while in 
the city of Kawasaki, there is an acclaimed penis festival 
called “Kanamara Matsuri” which is not subject to 
censorship.
Despite garnering several chuckles from the crowd, 
her intriguing essay also brought up issues of sexism, 
objectification of women, and body image. She also 
wrote that in modern, capitalist societies, women become 
insecure with their bodies due to constant exposure to 
advertisements and commercials that advocate a certain 
sexualized body image. This makes female viewers 
buy products to try to “improve their bodies and hating 
themselves when they can’t meet society’s unrealistic 
standards.”
The contest encouraged students to write about 
practically anything, Giracca saying that any story “is not 
too out there.” She confessed that since writing in itself is 
subjective, judging which essay should win or be a finalist 
was challenging. This year had almost 150 essays while 
last year had under 100 but Giracca credited this year’s 
increased attendance to positive word of mouth as only 
about 60 people attended last year.
The third annual essay contest will happen next April 
and WCI students may submit essays before May 31 and 
the three winners would receive a $75 gift card for use in 
the University Bookstore.

FAREWELL GAME
WOMEN’S TENNIS ACES FINAL SEASON

By JULIA DAY 
I

n March, the University at Albany 
women’s tennis team announced 
that the 2016 season would be their 
last. However, that didn’t stop the 
team of nine determined UAlbany student 
athletes from finishing their final season 
with a championship.
On Sunday, April 24 after a weekend 
of nail-biting matches, the UAlbany 
women’s tennis team became America 
East Champions, beating Stony Brook 
4-2. The team effort from the girls, 
assistant coach Petra Ferancova, and 
head coach Gordon Graham resulted in 
the program’s first Division I conference 
championship. The team’s final record for 
the season was 14-7.

“This is one of the most amazing 
college teams I’ve even been associated 
with in my 34 years of coaching,” said 
Graham to UAlbany Athletics. “The 
obstacles this team overcame not only 
today, but over the season would have 
floored anyone. This group has been on a 
mission since September.”
UAlbany is the third team to win 
the America East women’s tennis 
tournament. Since its formation 15 years 
ago, Boston University held the title 
consecutively from 2002-2011, followed 
by Stony Brook’s three year reign from 
2013-2015.
The weekend long America East 
tournament included UAlbany, Stony 
Brook University, Binghamton 
University, University at Maryland 

Baltimore County and Hartford. The first 
match of the weekend pitted Binghamton 
against Hartford, where Binghamton 
won 7-0. UAlbany went on to play 
Binghamton in the semi-finals, and won 
4-0. After Stony Brook’s victory against 
UMBC in the semi-finals, it was left to 
the two SUNY schools to battle it out for 
the title in the finals.
The Great Danes started the match 
with a 3-1 advantage over the Seawolves, 
with freshman Jovana Kenic, sophomore 
Ana Glumac and junior Paulina Torres 
sweeping each of their singles matches. 
Stony Brook fought back and won 3-2 
over UAlbany senior Dajana Ognjenovic.  
The final two matches, played by singles 
players Alba Sala and Isidora Pejovic, 
each went to a third set with the title on 

the line. Freshman Pejovic 
fought hard and won her 
match, suspending Sala’s 
game and winning with 
the advantage of 4-2 over 
Stony Brook. 
Now the America East 
victors, UAlbany will 
advance to the NCAA 
Tournament this May, 
pitting the girls against the 
top 16 teams in the nation.
Following their well-
deserved victory, UAlbany 
players Kenic, Ognjenovic, 
Sala, and Torres were 
named part of the America 
East All Conference Team. 
In addition, freshman 
Kenic was awarded Rookie 
& Player of the Year. 
America East also awarded 
senior Mireille Hermans 
the Elite 18 Award, and 
junior Paulina Torres Most 
Outstanding Player.
“One of the best feelings 
is seeing your hard work 
pay off,” said Torres. 
“[The award] could’ve 
gone to anyone on the 
team, we all deserve it.”
Teamwork was a key 
component as to how the 
team achieved a storybook 
ending to their final 
season.
“I think it really matters 
that we were a really close 
team and we fought really 
hard this semester,” said 
Hermans. “Especially 
after we heard that the 
tennis team was going to 
stop next year, I think we 
got more powerful and 
determined to win it.”
The decision to end 
the women’s tennis  
program at UAlbany stemmed from the 
announcement that UMBC and Hartford 
would discontinuing their programs in the 
America East Conference. Their departure 
left the conference without enough teams 
to qualify for the NCAA Tournament. 
Unable to find a new conference to enter, 
the team made the difficult decision to 
end the program. Determined more than 
ever, UAlbany was presented with their 
last opportunity to sweep the title.
Only a month after the news, 
UAlbany’s women’s tennis has proven 
themselves as the new queens of the 
America East Tournament. And with their 
continuation onto the NCAA Tournament, 
the team now has the chance at capping 
its final season with a storybook ending: 
an NCAA title.

OFF THE FIELD

By CELIA BALF

She sucks her stomach in as the trainers pinch her fat. She 
tries to tighten her arm muscles hoping they can’t detect her 
weight gain since getting on birth control. She looks at the 
numbers, compares them to her teammates and can’t help but 
feel insecure.
He doesn’t feel like himself anymore—he doesn’t want 
to go out and celebrate after a win, he doesn’t want to get up 
in the morning for practice, but the last thing he can do is tell 
someone. He’s supposed to be the strong one, the manly one, 
the Division 1 athlete who can take on any challenge. Yet 
here he is, insecure.
Mental health includes our emotional, psychological and 
social well being. For college athletes, mental health has 
always, perhaps more than the public at-large, had a stigma 
surrounding it –something teams know they have to discuss, 
players know they need to be aware of—but as a result, it is 
often just avoided.
It may have all started during a pick-up soccer game 
at a park or maybe some wall ball in the backyard—but, 
somewhere a little boy or girl fell in love with a sport. What 
may have begun as a lighthearted game soon became a full-
time hobby,
eventually an obligation, and then a job. Part of being 
a serious athlete is the dust the dirt off, kid and get back 
out there mentality that requires you to say you’re okay, 
even when you’re not. While sports are known for building 
commendable character traits—it
is also fair to say that they could also be known for hiding 
important truths. 
The NCAA recently published a book, “Mind, Body and 
Sport” which is used for college teams to understand and 
support student-athlete’s mental wellness. Though many 
college athletes seek to cultivate an image of invincibility, a 
survey by the American College Health Association found 
30 percent of the 195,000 respondents reported having felt 
depressed in the last 12 months and 50 percent felt anxiety.
At the University at Albany, student-athletes have felt 
depressed. They have also felt anxiety. Despite the hard front 

and confident stature that you may see in passing, they very 
well could be battling a mental illness. Every Tuesday, the 
Student-Athlete
Academic Services has a program called “Let’s Talk” 
which encourages athletes to stop by between 11a.m. to 
1p.m. to talk to one of the sports psychologists. Dr. Joyce 
DeWitt-Parker and Dr. Joe Monserrat are the two providers in 
psychological services to student-athletes.
The athletics department have implemented programs like 
‘Let’s Talk’ in order to provide athletes the choice to seek 
help if they need it. Dr. Parker and Monserrat will meet with 
teams throughout the semester to give the necessary guidance 
the respective team may need.
At the University of Michigan, three student-athletes 
created a video to promote mental health awareness and as a 
way to reverse the stigma. The three women worked with the 
University of Michigan School of Public Health, Depression 
Center and the Athletic Department to create Athletes 
Connected, an “Outreach and education program for student-
athletes to increase awareness around mental health issues, 
reduce the stigma of asking for help, and promote positive 
coping skills.” The video features different athletes as they 
share their personal battles with mental health.
For female athletes in particular, body image is a serious 
mental health issue. There is the outside pressure of society’s 
preoccupation with skinniness, which has to be weighed 
against the nutritional demands of training, namely building 
muscle. While body image impacts female athletes all over 
the word, ten to 25 percent of males have eating disorders too. 
Nick Bochette the assistant coach of the UAlbany women’s 
soccer team spoke to the Albany Student Press about the role 
coaches play in terms of student athletes mental health.  
“We are extremely conscious of our teammates mental 
well being,” Bochette said. “And often make considerations 
like extra days off, yoga, lighter training days, relaxed travel 
atmosphere, etc. to try to provide everyone with the time and 
support they need to maintain a healthy mental state.” 
Yoga and mental training have become an integral part of 
several teams at UAlbany. Coaches are constantly looking 
for ways to improve the performance of their athletes in all 

aspects by mixing up their training routines. Men’s lacrosse 
and men’s soccer have begun integrating yoga into their 
training regimes. The sheer fact that these grown men are 
taking to the yoga mat in order to find a zen place shows how 
far approaches to mental health in athletics have come. 
“If true mental health issues are involved, we encourage 
all of our teammates to seek the proper professional care they 
need,” Bochette said. 
“My aim as a coach has always been to draw attention to 
all the potential the player has and all the great things she can 
accomplish,” Bochette said. He said the act of trying to reach 
these standards will create a team who can succeed under all 
the greatest of pressures.
Bridget Pryal is the strength and conditioning coach for 
several varsity teams at UAlbany. “One of the main goals 
of a strength and conditioning program is instilling mental 
toughness in college athletes,” Pryal said. 
This toughness is challenged in the weight room every 
day. The lifting tasks that Pryal gives her athletes are both 
physically and mentally challenging. Her support is similar 
to the varsity coaches in how committed she is to challenging 
the athletes, but also making sure they are mentally prepared 
to handle the pressures.
Co-captain Kelly Kempf of the women’s soccer team 
said she thinks the topic of student-athlete mental health 
is a delicate subject. “You never want to seem weak [nor] 
put yourself in a situation that could affect your chances of 
playing,” Kempf said. “We put so much stress on ourselves 
by trying to always appear perfect because student-athletes 
strive for perfection.”
Every single day, student-athletes wake up with the feeling 
that they need to do more. Even if you play on the women’s 
basketball team and have won consecutive championships, 
not enough has been done. Even if you are a straight-A 
student and captain of your team, the job isn’t even close to 
being done. They though they may seem superhuman based 
on their feats on the field, student athletes grapple with mental 
health issues just like any other students, with programs 
like Let’s Talk the university has started a very important 
dialogue.
