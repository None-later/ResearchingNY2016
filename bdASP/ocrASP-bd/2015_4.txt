The University at Albany Inter-
faith Coalition held a candlelight 
vigil at the small fountains in front 
of the Campus Center. Students 
gathered despite the cold Saturday 
night to witness the first peace 
vigil at UAlbany.
“We are here tonight because, 
statistically, we are lucky enough 
to have woken up this morning 
and been alive. We are talking 
about peace, plans for peace, and 
how to be more peaceful stu-
dents on campus,” Derek Healey, 
president of the Interfaith Coali-
tion, said. He is a sophomore who 
is studying anthropology and 
religion.  
The goal was to make 1,000 
peace cranes in time for the vigil. 
The story of a Japanese girl who 
made 1,000 cranes in Japan was 
their inspiration. Despite some 
cranes getting stolen, more than 
1,163 cranes were made.
“Students… have been folding 
cranes and helping us get to our 
goal [since the block party]. Vari-
ous faith groups on campus were 
really instrumental in helping us… 
We were also in partnership with 
the peace action group on campus. 
Our focus for this week was to 
bring awareness to gun violence 
and hate crimes,” Healey said.
To support World International 
Peace Week, which began Sept. 
21, the Interfaith Coalition hosted 
activities every day to create a 
compassionate and more harmoni-
ous campus. Students got to sign 
a peace board to write about mean 
things which were said to them, in 
hopes to create greater peace and 
understanding for each individual.
World Peace Week promotes 
nonviolence throughout the world 
beginning on the UN International 
Day of Peace every year, ac-
knowledged by the World Council 
of Churches.
“Love yourself and love oth-
ers. Today we come together, 
many faiths and many people, 
in acceptance and love of one 
another despite our differences,” 
Jordan Emily Elizabeth Zavesky, 
president of the Newman Catholic 
Association and member of the 
Interfaith Coalition, said.
Many people from different 
faith groups attended the cer-
emony, including Cornerstone 
Campus Ministry pastor Sandy 
Damhof, Rabbi Mendel from 
Shabbos House, Muslim Student 

Association members Nikhil Jain 
and Swami, and various members 
of the Newman Association.
The vigil was complemented 
with peace cranes that hung on 
strings and covered the grounds 
near the podium. Names of 
victims of gun violence were read 
aloud with a moment of silence 
and some stories were shared near 
the small fountain.
“I want everyone ‘to call it 
when they see it’ when they see 
oppression. There were so many 
people in the 1930s and 1940s 
and throughout history, not just 
the Holocaust, who saw horrible 
things going on and didn’t take 
action or call it out. I don’t want 
people to just feel peaceful, but 
to also call out people who are 
impeding peace because that is 
the only way to make the world 
a better place,” Austin Ostro, the 
treasurer of Hillel, said.
“I’m just so grateful for the 
turn out and I’m very proud that 
students on campus realize the 
importance and value of peace 
-- in the broader world and inner 
peace. We came together tonight 
to try to further that dream and 
make peace,” Rachel Gomez, vice 
president of the Interfaith Coali-
tion, said.
The peace vigil was Healy’s 
idea, she added. Many students 
appreciated the ceremony, saying 
that the event was beautiful.
“I think it was beautiful, the 
candles and everything. I loved 
the atmosphere, it was very peace-
ful.” Elvis Agborcogo, a senior at 
Binghamton University, said.
The Interfaith Center strives to 
facilitate interfaith activities and 
encourage spirituality for students, 
faculty, staff and alumni. For more

A dead body was found in 
the tunnels at the University at 
Albany. 
On Saturday, Sept. 19, the 
University Police Department re-
ceived a report of a deceased male 
in the tunnels. 
The Deputy Chief of University 
Police at UAlbany, Aran Mull, 
said the report was of a univer-
sity employee who had a heart 
attacked and ultimately died. The 
employee was working at the time 
of his death.

“A community member found 
him collapsed in the tunnels and 
called us,” Mull said.
Upon receiving the report, UPD 
responded immediately, began 
CPR and called for medical as-
sistance, according to Mull. 
 “UPD, paramedics and other 
emergency medical personnel 
worked for almost an hour but 
they were unable to revive the 
employee,” Mull said.
The Albany Student Press will 
be updating the story online as we 
receive more information.

CAMPUS NEWS
Fewer meal trades, more 
problems, say students

CAMPUS DINING

By JANIE FRANK

This semester, the University 
at Albany has eliminated meal 
trades.
In previous years, meal trades 
allowed students to eat some-
where on the podium rather 
than in a residence dining hall, 
without having to rely on Munch 
Money. 
Executive Director of Univer-
sity Auxiliary Services, Stephen 
Pearse, said meal trades are no 
longer possible due to the reno-
vation in the Campus Center. 

There are not as many eateries 
open to students.
“When you look at the sheer 
number of transactions through 
meal trades… with the reduced 
number of locations, there were 
not enough locations to handle 
that type of business,” Pearse 
said. 
Pearse said students would 
have to wait in line for absurd 
amounts of time to get their 
food. 
“It would be crazy. You could 
never even get into the place,” 
he said. “It’s the sheer nature of 

having to do the renovations in 
the Campus Center.”
Many students are not happy 
with the new meal plans. 
Jessica Michel, a junior at 
UAlbany, created a petition on 
change.org entitiled “BRING 
BACK MEAL TRADES.” The 
petition has almost 400 support-
ers. 
“I am upset with the univer-
sity,” Michel said. “The school 
didn’t give out proper warning or 
a proper reasoning for not allow-
ing meal trades anymore.”

Derek Healy, president of the Interfaith 
Center, came up with the idea for a 
peace vigil. Over 1,000 paper cranes 
were made for the ceremony.

“ 

I don’t want 
people to 
just feel peaceful, 
but to also call out 
people who are 
impending peace 
because that is the 
only way to make 
the world a better 
place.”

of Hillel

DANES SAY WHAT?

 “I definitely prefer Uncommon Grounds. 
It is an inexpensive place and has a lot more 
options compared to Jazzman’s. The beverages 
at Uncommon Grounds are better tasting and are 
not watered down. I wish we could have kept it 
on campus.” 

- Calisa Grant, Class of 2015 

This week, we asked students: 

Do you prefer the new Jazzman’s Cafe 
or the old Uncommon Grounds?

Compiled by Vaughnee 
Simmons

“I totally prefer Uncommon Grounds over 
Jazzman’s Cafe. It promotes a more local 
business and their bagels are amazing. Jazzman’s 
cafe doesn’t have a vegan option, which is 
essential to those on campus that have different 
eating preferences.”

- Emily Buis, Class of 2018

 “I like Jazzman’s Cafe better 
compared to Uncommon Grounds. It 
was a great addition to the new beautiful 
campus center wing. Jazzman’s Cafe 
not only does beverages. They also have 
the ready to go salads and sushi. This 
selection is great.”

- Chloe Sumner, Class of 2017

“I think Jazzman’s was a great addition to the 
campus center. Jazzman’s is something new, 
whereas Uncommon Grounds is found locally 
in Albany. I just think it is great to have a new 
campus establishment so that way maybe it 
could lead to a bigger business. Also Jazzman’s 
drink and food options are awesome. Having a 
different variety is essential for a large campus 
like UAlbany.”

- Jenessa Wilson, Class of 2015

Late for life:
What should I do?

Dear Middle Earth,

I need help! It seems 
like I’m always late for 
things – class, meetings, 
work, and other things. I’m 
not a morning person, and 
it’s hard for me to wake up, 
but the lateness problem 
doesn’t just affect me in the 
morning. Whenever I go out 
with my friends, I show up 
later than I said I would – 
I’ve been left behind more 
than once because people 
got tired of waiting for me 
or thought I wasn’t going 
to show up. My boss has 
already talked to me about 
this at work once this se-
mester. People get annoyed 
with me about this, and I am 
driving myself crazy, but I 
just can’t seem to get places 
on time. Any suggestions? 
Thanks! Annoyed with 
Myself

Dear Annoyed,

Lateness is a problem 
that affects many people, 
both those who are late, 
and those who wait for 
those who aren’t on time. 
Sometimes problems 
with lateness have ways 
of correcting themselves 
because the consequences 
for chronic lateness can be 
severe (i.e., loss of a job, 
lowered grades, etc.).    
By asking your question, 
however, it seems as if you 
are interested in addressing 
the problem before more 
serious consequences arise. 
Planning a daily schedule 
may help you organize your 
time better. In making the 
schedule, however, it is 
important to be honest with 
yourself about how long ac-
tivities will take. Allow for 
extra time for unexpected 
events, and take activities 
into account that take little 
time, but are necessary 

(such as needing to get 
gasoline or cash on the way 
to meet friends). If activities 
always seem to take longer 
than you think, add extra 
time into your schedule for 
each activity. 
It may help you to try 
thinking about your tardi-
ness as a sign of disrespect 
to your friends, colleagues, 
and professors – a sign, per-
haps, that you are somehow 
better and more privileged 
than they are, and, there-
fore, exempt from social 
norms about prompt arrival 
with which most other peo-
ple comply. Some people do 
view other people’s lateness 
this way! You may want to 
ask yourself whether you 
really care enough about the 
people and organizations in 
your life to follow through 
on your commitments, 
whether they are official 
commitments or unspoken 
ones. We am not trying to 
make you feel guilty! We 
are simply offering you and 
other people a different way 
to look at this extremely 
common social, profession-
al, and academic problem. 
If you do seem to have 
a problem with not having 
enough energy in the morn-
ing, you may want to try 
going to bed earlier and see-
ing whether that helps put 
some spring in your early-
morning steps. Exercise and 
meditation may also help 
give you an energy boost in 
the A.M. hours. Starting out 
earlier to compensate for 
procrastination and unex-
pected interruptions in your 
schedule can help you get 
where you want to be once 
you get out of bed.
Your lateness may also 
be due to difficulties with 
time management. A great 
deal of stress in students’ 
lives revolves around time. 
Procrastination is one major 

difficulty many people ex-
perience in managing time. 
Time management has a 
great deal to do with deter-
mining short- and long-term 
priorities and setting goals. 
It’s important to remember 
that it is never too late to 
remedy chronic lateness, 
and by asking your question 
you appear to be motivated 
to do so.
If you feel that you are 
constantly in danger of 
drowning in the sea of time, 
or if your lateness has led 
to negative consequences in 
different areas of your life, 
you might want to consider 
talking to a trained peer by 
calling the Middle Earth 
Peer Assistance hotline at 
518-442-5777. The Middle 
Earth Peer Assistance hot-
line is free, anonymous, and 
open when classes at the 
University at Albany are in 
session during the academic 
year (September through 
May). The hotline hours 
are from 1 p.m. to midnight 
Monday through Thursday 
and 24 hours on weekends 
beginning on Friday at 1 
p.m. and ending on Sunday 
at midnight.
If you would like to 
talk to a professional 
confidentially about this 
topic, there is a great 
option for you. If you are 
a UAlbany student, you 
can make an appointment 
at Counseling and 
Psychological Services 
(CAPS) with a mental 
health professional to 
discuss this subject 
further. To make an 
appointment with any of the 
psychologists at CAPS, call 
518-442-5800. Additional 
information about services 
that Counseling and 
Psychological Services 
offers can be found at

FROM THE ARCHIVES

MIDDLE EARTH

From the Sept. 21, 1975 issue of the 
Albany Student Press:

   Leakage into the lecture centers 
forced the University at Albany to 
spend approximately $200,000 to 
chop down trees around the podium, 
along with the removal of some 
shrubs and soil around the area. 
   Recently, trees around campus 
have been removed due to 
construction. Many of the trees that 
were recently removed also were 
affected by diplodia, which is a fungi 
that rapidly spreads through trees.

A

llow me to explain a concept that 
has been ingrained in our heads for 
centuries, but is now commonly 
misconstrued and misunderstood: 
feminism.
   I feel the need to explain what this term 
truly means because it is no longer being 
used to properly explain what it means or 
what it is supposed to do.
   First, the Merriam-Webster Dictionary 
defines feminism as “the belief that men 
and women should have equal rights and 
opportunities,” and “organized activity in 
support of women’s rights and interest.”
   This means that there is a belief system 
in place that would rather women and 
men have access to the same rights and 
opportunities. This would essentially 
substantiate women in the same regard that 
men have been in for centuries. 
   Now, it is no surprise that men have been 
known to be the dominant sex for many 
generations. In this day and age, this does 
not have to be our only truth, and that is 
where feminism comes into play.
   The first-wave of feminism occurred in 
the late 19th and early 20th centuries.
   Martha Rampton wrote, for the Pacific 
University Center for Gender Equity: 
“The goal of this wave was to open up 
opportunities for women, with a focus 
on suffrage. The wave formally began 
at the Seneca Falls Convention in 1848, 
when 300 men and women rallied to the 
cause of equality for women. Elizabeth 
Cady Stanton drafted the Seneca Falls 
Declaration outlining the new movement’s 
ideology and political strategies.” 
   Men and women alike recognized the 
need for women to have the right to vote 
as a basic human right, man or woman. 
From there the second and third waves 
of feminism occurred, giving women the 
opportunity to be granted equal rights 
regardless of sex and to be able to take 
ownership of their sexuality, putting to rest 
terms like “slut” and “bitch” (in theory). 
   I make this historical contextualization of 
the beginnings of feminism brief because I 
want to make a point in today’s culture of 
the true importance of feminism. 
   Of course feminism, for people who 
do not study it or think about it, is often 
associated with “bra burning.” This is an 
act that some women took in the 1960s to 
showcase their independence from men in 
support of women’s rights. This is one of 
the more radical protests that women have 
undergone, and quite possibly the most 
remembered. 
   This doesn’t mean that all feminists were 
burning their bras. In fact, it is it said that 

only a few women were, according to a 
Time article written by Jennifer Lee. 
   “Bras were never burned at the 1968 Miss 
America protest, but that the image persists 
shows how full of holes our knowledge is 
of the Women’s Liberation Movement,” 
Lee wrote.
   This association needs to be amended in 
society’s image of feminism.
   Feminism at its core simply seeks to 
appropriate women to the same standards 
as men. I believe that everyone should 
have the same mind-set in this society. 
I also firmly believe that, when trying 
to understand feminism, the role of men 
should not be undermined or diminished. 

   Feminism is not an attack on the male 
culture by any means. Feminism does not 
aim to relieve men of the standard that 
they have been living at for centuries. Men 
should not be reduced to nothing in order to 
bring women up higher in society. 
   Feminism does not create this imaginary 
scale that needs to dip to one side in order 
to create a fully functioning society. 
Feminism seeks to raise the standard for 
women in their all-around basic human 
rights to reach the level that men have been 
at for centuries. 
   I think this generation needs to open 
up a book or two and understand the 
history of feminism and what it means 

to be a feminist. It is not solely praising 
women and forgetting men, or thinking 
that women are better than men. We need 
to erase what we thought of feminism 
and the associations that it came with and 
understand that every human has rights that 
must be upheld.
   So please, turn off the “female 
empowerment” songs that completely shit 
on all men by labeling them as cheaters, 
liars, abusers and downright horrible 
people and start to empower women 
to reach the pinnacle of status and the 
pedestal that men have been standing for 
ages, because there is plenty of room for 
women.

THE TRUE DEFINITION OF FEMINISM

WOMEN’S ISSUES

Source: Pixabay
Feminism is defined as “the belief that men and women should have equal rights and opportunities.” Feminism promotes the 
empowerment of women that has spanned several waves throughout history.

Source: Wikipedia
Pope Francis paid a visit to the united states and addressed 
several critical challenges of our time. Students should actively 
engage in organizations that help resolve these issues.

It is truly refreshing to see a 
global figure with such popularity 
based in high moral standing, 
especially when the norm 
of leadership in this country 
often feels much the opposite. 
Unfortunately, expecting 
members of our political class 
to instantly turn over a new leaf 
is like expecting to walk to class 
tomorrow without having your 
ears assaulted by construction. 
It’s not going to happen.
Our politics are what they 
are, and followers of the early 
race for the presidency could 
argue that it is getting worse. 
According to Gallup, over 80 
percent of Americans disapprove 
of Congress. Closer to home, the 
leaders of the New York State 
Assembly and Senate were both 
indicted this year. 
It is a mess. 
The type of ethic the pope 
is suggesting stands in stark 
contrast to reality. Our political 
system is marked by powerful 
special interests, misleading 

partisan rhetoric, and a lack of 
constructivism. Little is being 
done to address the critical 
challenges that we have to deal 
with. When looking for leadership 
and direction, Americans don’t 
have anywhere reliable to turn to. 
So where does this leave us as 
college students? 
We’re a generation that 
often gets criticized for being 
narcissistic and caring for nothing 
beyond funny videos on the 
Internet. There’s a grain of truth 
there, but it is still unfair. Any 
apathy that is happening among 
young adults is more a reflection 
of current leadership than it is the 
character of millennials.
There is also plenty of evidence 
that college students have what 
it takes to do better than our 
current leaders. Here at the 
University at Albany, there are 
dozens of student organizations 
with hundreds of students who 
volunteer their time to worthy 
causes. In the next few weeks 
alone, there are events on campus 

to raise awareness for sexual 
assault victims and breast cancer. 
There are also a slate of service 
events scheduled in October for 
Community Engagement Month. 
Places like UAlbany are the 
training grounds of the leaders 
of tomorrow. Observing the best 
of what is going on around here 
is cause for optimism about the 
future. However, if the leadership 
of the future is going to improve 
to where these big issues will be 
realistically addressed, the bar 
still has to be raised.
It is unlikely that problems like 
climate change and violence will 
have disappeared 25 years from 
now. We are more able to tackle 
poverty, but that will probably 
still exist too. Further, the future 
will bring about unforeseen 
challenges that will be every 
bit as difficult as the ones that 
aren’t being solved currently. 
Rapid technological advances 
will displace jobs, increasingly 
invade privacy, and make war 
more lethal, while geopolitical 
power shifts may threaten global 
stability.
In this context, we have to 
be as good as we possibly can 
be now so that our generation 
represents a new and improved 
ethic of leadership in the future. 
Current UAlbany students may 
not be in Congress, but many 
will be leaders in their offices, 
communities and families. A 

mass culture of civic-mindedness 
is needed from the bottom up to 
navigate the storms of the future.
The remarkable part about 
the present is that for every 
difficult problem, there is a 
hopeful development. Poverty 
around the world is decreasing, 
and technological advances 
should give us the tools to 
tackle issues more effectively 
than ever. Examples of this 
can already be seen with the 
crowdsourcing efforts bringing 
previously unattainable resources 
to innovators in the developing 
world.

More things like that are 
needed, and the idealism of young 
adults can provide a lot of it. 
What student leaders at UAlbany 
and around the country are doing 
today in preparation for tomorrow 
may be the difference in tipping 
the scales of the future toward 
extraordinary progress and away 
from disaster.
Just for context, Pope Francis is 
78. The average age of a congress 
member is 62. Making sure the 
coming decades are filled with 
progress is much more real to 
those on the Podium than those in 
the Capitol.

L

ast week Pope Francis addressed the U.S. 
House of Representatives and spoke about 
many of the critical challenges of our time: 
serving the poor, world violence, and climate 
change. He urged the power brokers of D.C. to 
approach these issues with all of the ideals of 
public service.

Student artist Ashley Powell hung 
several signs that read “White Only” and 
“Black Only” around the University of 
Buffalo campus in mid-September.This 
artist’s creation is real. It makes people 
talk, because it’s not something that has 
dissolved into the past. Real in the sense 
that it’s still present in society. 
“Our society still actively maintains 
racist structures that benefit one group 
of people, and oppress another… Forty 
to fifty years ago, these structures were 
visibly apparent and physically graspable 
through the existence of signs that looked 
exactly like the signs I put up,” Powell, 
an African American student, said in a 
statement to The New York Times. “Today 

these signs may no longer exist, but the 
system that they once reinforced still 
does.” 
This is true. Although society has 
progressed in its desegregation, forms 
of segregation still exist. Powell is 
just exposing the reality of things, as 
people insist that we have fixed those 
circumstances, when we are merely 
recovering. She amplified this message 
in the simplest of methods, using signs 
to say that it’s easy to be unnecessarily 
racist. With just a sign, a race of people 
were restricted, and even though we have 
evolved from that era, there are things 
today that replace that sign. 
Some of the areas in which the signs 
were placed include near restrooms or 
fountains, thus effectively portraying 

an image dated before the civil-rights 
movement. And of course this causes 
discomfort and controversy. 
This is much needed controversy. People 
have claimed that the project is, in itself, 
an act of racism. Powell intentionally 
brought out the emotions of racism. Powell 
voiced what society tries to hide, exposing 
society’s skeleton in the closet.
I had a coworker who had a similar 
concept in her university, though it 
wasn’t an art project. Instead, the LGBT 
community decided to explicitly label 
areas that were free from judgment with 
a colored paper. Any place with colored 
paper reinforced the idea that one can be 
who they are, whether it be gay, lesbian, 
queer, gender fluid or so on. 
A group on campus decided to actively 

protest this. They said every part of the 
campus should be a place in which people 
can be who they are with no fear. But the 
purpose of this project was to acknowledge 
that not every place is accepting of people.    
 These stories may pertain to different 
oppressed groups, but the point they are 
trying to stress is that even though we go 
on as if everything is fine, that doesn’t fix 
anything. 
I applaud Ashley Powell for voicing 
her message. She is making people talk, 
she is making people feel uncomfortable, 
and she is encouraging people to embrace 
themselves and pursue a culture of 
inclusion. She brings up this inequality 
because, simply, it still exists. She 
acknowledged it and she wanted others to 
acknowledge it, too.

As a University at Albany student, 
each one of us is bound to have a mix of 
great professors, some of who we enjoy 
learning from and some who we dislike
However, there is at least one thing 
all professors have in common: All 
professors hold office hours where they 
can assist students face-to-face or clarify 
anything a student didn’t understand 
during class time. 
Typically at the start of a semester, a 
professor will hand out a syllabus that 
outlines what students are expected to do, 
what the deadlines are, and the overall 
grading criteria. Also included are their 
office hours, which are a hidden gem. 
Often, the professor will discuss them 
briefly before moving on to a monologue 
about exams or his or her policy 
regarding in-class electronic device 
usage. 
Office hours can be a better option 
than simply approaching a professor 
right after class. It is possible that one 
may immediately have to rush to his or 
her next class, have time-consuming to 
discuss, or the professor may already 
be bombarded with other students who 
have questions of their own. Also, if 
a professor’s office hours clash with a 
student’s own schedule, it would be best 
to inform him or her so a compromise can 
be found.

Naturally, there are some students 
who are more introverted than others and 
are more likely to be shy or intimidated 
when alone in a room with a professor 
that is well versed in a particular subject. 
As individuals, we hate coming off as 
unintelligent if we have questions about 
something, making it feel daunting to 
approach a professor who could perceive 
you as such. 
There are many benefits of attending 
office hours even one time. If a professor 
is approached, a number of the following 
benefits will be earned:
1. One will be able to understand 
something he or she didn’t quite get from 
class and the professor can reiterate the 
misunderstanding with more detail the 
second time around.
2. Approaching a professor for help 
shows him or her that the student is 
indeed concerned about his or her grades 
and takes the class seriously.
3. The professor will actually learn 
the student’s name, remember it and get 
a feel of who that person is as a student, 
especially if that student makes regular 
appearances at the office. They won’t just 
be some name on an attendance list.
4. If the class is relevant to one’s 
major, the professor could, in turn, 
help that student by writing a letter of 
recommendation for an internship. 
5. The professor could perhaps serve 
as a mentor and give professional advice 

because they know what post-graduation 
life is. 
6. If a student’s personal life has 
a negative impact on their academic 
performance, going to office hours will 
give the professor the opportunity to 
know the student better.  The professor 
could even give some personal advice. 
A professor can indeed truly surprise a 
student.
7. Once a student graduates and 
becomes successful in a career, they 
may decide to keep in contact with that 
professor. The student can then support 
the former professor by returning to the 
campus to speak to the current class, talk 
about how they succeeded with the help 
of that professor, their office hours, and 
the course as a whole. This can inspire 
students to perhaps do that same thing.
Last year when I was a freshman, I 
used to go to the giant lecture halls for 
classes and they would always be filled 
with hundreds of other students. I felt 
swallowed up in the crowd and was 
frequently lost with what the professor 
taught. Thus, I found myself having to 
return to the old-fashioned textbooks 
to answer my questions, but even they 
didn’t always help.
At one point, I dared to finally see 
one of my professors during his office 
hours for help because a major exam 
was rapidly approaching. However, 
my professor was busy helping another 

student in his room at the time and I 
impatiently decided to walk away and do 
my best in the upcoming exam. Needless 
to say, I did not get a very attractive 
grade in the end, but it taught me to be 
more willing to seek help whenever I fell 
behind. 
Nicole Glass of USA Today wrote 
“From Professor to Lifelong Mentor: 
How to Establish the Connection” in 
January 2013, which outlines how 
beneficial approaching a professor via his 
or her office hours is for not only getting 
higher grades, but having a better overall 
college experience. While the article is 
two years old, its themes and content 
still applies today, and Glass includes 
numerous real-life examples of students 
who have succeeded. 
“[My professor] shared some of her 
own personal experiences and how she 
battled them and encouraged me to stay 
positive and think highly of myself,” 
Vanessa Jade, an American University 
graduate said. “Ever since then, she has 
always checked in on me, asked me how 
I was doing and always told me she was 
proud of me.”
Don’t be shy if there is a question 
that needs to be asked in class. Take the 
initiative and seek the professor’s help 
during office hours. It feels significantly 
better to get answers than to drown amid 
all those questions.

Why students should attend office hours

Signs speak louder than words: Art project goes awry

Reaching out to professors during their office hours is a great way to get to know a professor and it becomes beneficial to learn from their expertise and get their advice 
regarding one’s overall college experience.

“Breathing Lights,” a public 
art piece led by University at 
Albany’s Prof. Adam Frelin, 
architect Barbara Nelson, and 
managed by arts management 
expert Judy Gilmore, is utilizing 
economically disadvantaged 
spaces in Schenectady, Albany 
and Troy as a canvas to open a 
dialogue about vacancy in urban 
areas within the Capital Region. 
Hundreds of buildings are 
constantly left vacant by former 
inhabitants who relocate from 
these areas, leaving a lifeless feel 
to the cities while decreasing the 
property value of the neighboring 
homes. Vacancy is an issue that 
is prevalent in the Northeast, 
typically in former manufacturing 
hubs. 
There has been a large effort on 
the part of these towns to revive 
these cities and restore their former 
vibrancy through renovation. The 
Breathing Lights project, expected 
to show in the fall of 2016, takes 
a novel approach to restoration 

through creative artistic display. 
The construction of the project 
involves miniature LED strip 
lights that will be bound in 
adhesive fabric and affixed to the 
interior windows of these vacant 
homes. The lights, which will be 
fueled by batteries and rheostats, 
will illuminate the buildings one 
by one, creating the illusion of a 
breathing presence still occupying 
these homes through its cyclical 
warm glow. 
Frelin said that the idea for the 
piece was originally generated 
for the Bloomberg Philanthropies 
Public Art Challenge, for which 
the prize is a $1 million grant. In 
collaboration with Nelson, Frelin 
wanted to create an inventive 
display with a meaningful 
message while taking advantage of 
technology. 
While reflecting on what this 
particular region has to offer, 
Frelin and Nelson thought of the 
history of lighting, which the 
Capital Region contributed to 
substantially (General Electric, or 
GE, in Schenectady was formed 

in 1889 by Thomas Edison and 
investors). Moreover, Frelin 
wanted to design a project that 
would unite communities from the 
grassroots up to the policyholders 
in a captivating and digestible 
way. 
Frelin said that the intention of 
the project was for viewers to want 
to seek out more information on 
the issue as a result of stumbling 
across the project “by accident.” 
Unlike many platforms for social 
issues, “Breathing Lights” is an 
attempt to subtly and beautifully 
lead its audience into discussion 
out of their own interest and 
curiosity. 
Frelin said that the project is 
designed to “suit more than one 
need.” With the many contributors 
to the production including 
architects, students, engineers, 
artists, product developers, and 
policy makers, “Breathing Lights” 
is a multidimensional project 
meant to serve many purposes 
to many different people. Frelin 
specifically wanted to weave art 
more cohesively into the fabric of 

our everyday lives. 
“I want people to feel the 
experience of living amongst art,” 
Frelin said, “We don’t have much 
of that here.”
In addition, Frelin said that the 
team hopes to “create leverage and 
provide a platform for others to get 
on board.”
The project has been met with 
immensely positive responses 
in all corners of the Capital 
Region. The College of Arts and 
Sciences at UAlbany, as well as 
the Albany Foundation, are given 
a particularly notable mention 
in this effort. The mayors and 
organizations in each targeted 
city have also been extremely 
supportive. 
The production team has 
partnered with an organization 
in each city that it extends to. 
There is a hub of community 
engagement located within each 
city that will utilize a given portion 
of the allocated funds towards art 
outreach specifically as pertaining 
to issues of vacancy. It is up to 
each organization how they choose 

to develop their own unique 
curriculum of arts education and 
advocacy. 
At the culmination of the 
project, there is a projected event 
that will take place at Proctor’s in 
Schenectady, joining the people 
from these neighborhoods with 
policy makers and others in a 
series of discussions about the 
issues of vacancy and art. 
With the money that could have 
been allocated to renovating about 
four houses, Frelin and the rest of 
the team generating “Breathing 
Lights” have managed to create 
an extensive network of outreach 
and impact the lives of many in the 
Capital Region. Frelin emphasized 
the importance of artists to “go 
with [their] gut.” 
“Keep close contact with what 
you’re feeling and what motivates 
you,” Frelin said. 
This advice can be universally 
applicable to anyone who would 
like to make a difference in the 
world and a positive, lasting 
impact.

Residents of Westeros can 
rejoice as the beloved fantasy 
series “Game of Thrones” finally 
won the Primetime Emmy Award 
for Outstanding Drama Series this 
year after five consecutive years 
of nominations in that category. 
“Game of Thrones” also set a new 
record with most awards during 
one year by winning 12 awards 
out of its 24 nominations.
The 67th Primetime Emmy 
Awards ceremony recognized the 
year’s most outstanding American 
prime time television shows and 
was held on Sept. 20. The show 
was hosted by “Saturday Night 
Live” alumnus Andy Samberg 
for the first time. While his band 
The Lonely Island didn’t appear, 
Samberg did open the show with a 
musical monologue that parodied 
many of the nominated televi-
sion shows and continued with an 
opening monologue that began 
with a forewarning that “Justin 
Timberlake isn’t coming.”
Samberg skewered the likes of 
Bill Cosby, Donald Trump and 
Paula Deen during his mono-

logue. 
“Is it just me or does Bernie 
Sanders always look like his flight 
is delayed?” Samberg had also 
joked of the democratic candidate.
HBO owned the night by 
winning a total of 43 Emmys in 
multiple categories from both the 
Primetime and the Creative Arts 
Emmy Awards. The network won 
for its shows “Veep,” “Olive Kit-
teridge,” “Bessie,” “Boardwalk 
Empire,” “Silicon Valley” and 
“Game of Thrones”.
“Game of Thrones” and 
“Veep” both took home Outstand-
ing Series in their respective 
categories. Julia Louis-Dreyfus 
won for Outstanding Lead Ac-
tress in a Comedy Series for her 
role as President Selina Meyer 
in “Veep.” Peter Dinklage of 
“Thrones” and Tony Hale of 
“Veep” each won for Outstanding 
Supporting Actor. Both shows 
also won awards for Outstand-
ing Writing and “Thrones” also 
managed to pick up an additional 
Outstanding Directing award.
HBO’s lauded miniseries “Ol-
ive Kitteridge” managed to sweep 
the limited series categories, 

winning awards in Outstanding 
Series, Writing, Directing, Lead 
and Supporting Actors.
Viola Davis also made history 
by being the first African-Amer-
ican woman to win for Outstand-
ing Lead Actress in a Drama 
Series for her role in “How to Get 
Away with Murder.” During her 
speech, Davis quoted African-
American abolitionist Harriet 
Tubman while pointing out the 
disparaged opportunities in the 
industry for African-American 
women. 
“The only thing that separates 
women of color from anyone else 
is opportunity,” she said. “You 
cannot win an Emmy for roles 
that are not simply there.”
Jeffrey Tambor won for Out-
standing Lead Actor in a Comedy 
Series for his role as a transgen-
der woman in Amazon’s series 
“Transparent.” This is the second 
time the Emmys have honored an 
actor with an award for portraying 
a transgender character. 
“Thank you for your patience,” 
he said, dedicating his win to the 
transgender community. “Thank 
you for your courage, thank you 

for your stories, thank you for let-
ting us be part of the change.”
Jon Hamm received a standing 
ovation from the crowd when he 
won for Outstanding Lead Actor 
in a Drama Series for the final 
season of the AMC drama “Mad 
Men.” Hamm had been nominated 
for his role as Don Draper seven 
times before and had been nomi-
nated for a total of 16 Emmys 
overall before finally winning.
Rising comedian Amy Schum-
er won her first Emmy ever for 
Outstanding Variety Sketch 
Series for her Comedy Central 
show “Inside Amy Schumer.” She 

was also nominated for Outstand-
ing Writing, Directing, and Lead 
Actress for the same series.  
“Thanks everybody who has 
helped me…the girl who gave 
me this sort of a smoky eye,” she 
quipped about her eye shadow 
during her acceptance speech.
The 67th Primetime Emmy 
Awards was a landmark year for 
television, breaking numerous 
records for multiple television 
shows. Andy Samberg summa-
rized this when he sang in his 
opening musical number, “So 
many shows…and so little time.”

The Capital Region’s hardcore, 
metal, and punk scene is currently 
in a state of distress. Over the past 
few months, attendance at shows 
has been much lower than nor-
mal, thereby contributing to some 
major losses for the promoters 
and the decision by many bands 
to skip the once-hotbed region on 
their touring routes. 
On Sept. 13 Dan Asylum and 
Mike Valente, the owners of 
Upstate Black N’ Blue - Albany’s 
chief booking and promotion 
agency for hardcore, punk, and 
metal shows - hosted an open 
meeting to discuss the state of the 
scene and to exchange ideas on 
how to improve attendance. The 
meeting was held at The Fuze 
Box on Central Ave. in down-
town Albany, which has become 
the primary venue for shows since 
the closing of the beloved Bogies 
on Ontario Street last May. 
“This year has been really 
rough,” Asylum said to the crowd 
of 30 to 40 people. “It seems that 
after Bogies closed a lot of people 
were displaced.”
The 34-year-old has been 
booking shows in Albany for 
10 years, which has given him 
insight to the fluctuations of the 
scene as well as what’s needed 
to fix it. When he began book-
ing shows the internet wasn’t a 
feasible option for promoting. 
Instead, the seemingly-abandoned 
method of “flyering,” the distri-
bution of mass amounts of paper 
event flyers outside of venues and 
around the city, is what fueled the 
strong attendance. 
“Social media isn’t the answer 
to everything,” said Asylum. 
“Facebook is letting us down 
now.”
According to Asylum, Face-
book is making it increasingly dif-
ficult for Upstate Black N’ Blue 
to promote their events. Facebook 
now caps the number of people 
one can “invite” to an “event” at 
1,000, regardless of how many 
“friends” said person has. There-
fore, Asylum and Valente are only 
able to invite roughly one-fifth of 
their potential customer base to 
their Facebook event pages. 
Asylum said that many people 
come to him after a show has 
happened and tell him that they 
weren’t even aware it was tak-
ing place. He and Valente both 
agree that going back to the old 

fashioned way of flyering is the 
solution to this problem. 
“If you’re in a band, flyer,” 
Valente said. “Fuck Facebook. It’s 
nothing but bullshit.” 
Valente, who refuses to reveal 
his actual age, has been involved 
with booking and promotion since 
the ‘80s. He’s also a member of 
the local metallic-hardcore band 
Brick By Brick. He spoke numer-
ous times at the meeting about the 
importance of local bands promot-
ing their own shows. 
“I’d rather have bands flyer-
ing than selling tickets. I think 
that having bands sell tickets is 
borderline insulting,” he said, 
referring to a practice many other 
promoters utilize in which local 
bands are forced to sell a certain 
amount of tickets in order to play 
the show. 
Asylum and Valente embody 
the true spirit of hardcore and 
punk music in that neither of them 
is in this business to make money. 
The two actually often lose money 

on shows but being in this busi-
ness has given them, and most 
of the other frequent attendees, a 
sense of purpose.
“I don’t mind losing. I expect to 
lose,” Valente said. “I do it ‘cause 
I love the music. It makes it so I 
can sleep at night.”
“Booking shows brought me 
out of my shell,” Asylum said. 
“I used to be so anti-social that 
people thought I was mute.”
Nevertheless, neither of them 
can afford to take $1,500 losses 
on shows that flop because no one 
comes out. Last month Valente 
booked the metalcore band 
Unearth to play Upstate Concert 
Hall. However, not nearly enough 
people showed up to cover the 
costs. 
“I do my research,” said 
Valente. “I was looking at how 
many kids Unearth was drawing 
on every other date of the tour and 
it was averaging between 300-400 
each night. I thought I’d be able to 
get 200 kids easy [but] there were 

barely 100 people in there.” 
According to Asylum, metal 
shows cost roughly double what 
any hardcore show costs to put on. 
He said that the average cost for a 
hardcore show is about $1,000 but 
with the recent lack of attendance 
even the smallest shows can be 
risky to put on. Therefore, Asylum 
and Valente have been passing on 
many offers solely because they 
don’t think they’ll be able to draw 
enough kids. 
“We can put it together, but 
it’s up to you guys to decide what 
you want it to be,” Asylum said, 
addressing the room of intent lis-
teners. He said that if people don’t 
come out then there’s going to 
continue to be less and less shows. 
Taylor Blake, a 17-year-old 
show-goer and a freshman at the 
University at Albany, was encour-
aging every member of the scene 
to share events and flyers just as 
much as Asylum and Valente do. 
“It’s not fair to put it all on Dan 
and Mike. It’s up to us to pro-

mote as well,” she said. “We all 
have thousands and thousands of 
Facebook friends. We should be 
sharing all the events that we can 
in order to reach the people that 
Dan and Mike can’t.”
By the end of the meeting, the 
most agreed-upon ideas were that 
everyone should be flyering and 
sharing events on social media, 
trying their hardest to bring new 
people into the scene and make 
them feel welcome, and for there 
to be more shows consisting of 
only local bands.
Valente, Asylum and the rest of 
the group were all hopeful that if 
those techniques were employed, 
the scene would begin to flourish 
once again. 
“Albany always had the reputa-
tion for having a great scene,” said 
Asylum. “We need to bring that 
back and live up to that.”
“The scene doesn’t need to 
be saved,” Valente said. “Just 
educated.”

FILM REVIEW

By THOMAS KIKA

“The Visit,” the latest film 
from “Sixth Sense” director 
M. Night Shyamalan and 
the next in a long line of 
attempted comebacks for the 
beleaguered auteur, never really 
accomplishes anything it sets out 
to do.  
After a decade-and-change of 
duds like “Lady in the Water” 
and “The Last Airbender,” this 
new effort sees Shyamalan 
going small for a micro-budget 
found-footage horror thriller, 
full of the sort of character study 
and drama that pervaded his 
early successes.  Unfortunately 
for Shyamalan’s career and 
the audience, “The Visit” is a 
non-starter, built on character 
drama with unlikable characters 
and a misbalanced attempt at 
the tricky horror-comedy sub 
genre.  Still, in the end, one gets 

the sense that even with another 
failure, Shyamalan seems to 
finally be headed in the right 
direction.
Told in a deeply unnecessary 
faux-documentary style, “The 
Visit” finds two children, Becca 
and Tyler, visiting grandparents 
they have never met while their 
troubled mother is away with 
a new boyfriend. Becca, an 
aspiring young documentarian, 
believes this is her chance to 
make a film that will repair the 
rift between her mother and 
grandparents, a rift created after 
a violent argument caused them 
to become estranged years prior.  
Tyler, her little brother and an 
amateur rapper on YouTube 
is more interested in mucking 
with her attempts at sincerity.  
Things start off on an odd note, 
as “Nana and Pop-Pop” first 
come off as strangely distant 
and absent-minded, but soon it 

all takes a turn for the bizarre 
as their grandparents behavior 
grows more disturbing and 
violent. 
The first problem with all 
this becomes evident in the 
early minutes of the film.  
These characters, as sketched 
in Shyamalan’s script, just 
do not work. Becca is mostly 
a one-note cliché, an overly 
proper and serious know-it-all 
type, too stiff for the audience 
to gravitate towards.  
She fares much better 
than Tyler, however.  
Everything about his character 
seems miscalculated, as 
if Shyamalan mistook 
obnoxious for endearing on 
every level. A self-proclaimed 
“rapper,” Tyler relishes every 
opportunity to share some 
his skin-crawlingly awful 
rhymes and to boast about his 
buzz on YouTube.  The most 

dread-inducing thing about “The 
Visit” is the realization that there 
is nothing you can do to stop his 
pre-pubescent sexual braggadocio, 
short of leaving the theater in a 
mad sprint.
The grandparents are not much 
better themselves.  Peter McRobbie 
and Deanna Dunagan are to be 
praised for committing fully to 
the off-kilter creepiness that their 
roles call for, especially Dunagan, 
whose character goes to some 
much more uncomfortable places.  
Unfortunately, Shyamalan is in 
too much of a hurry to get to the 
creepiness, so these characters are 
played as strange and unnerving 
from the first second they appear 
on screen.  A little bit of that 
sort of thing for foreshadowing 
is all well and good, but the way 
Shyamalan presents them one 
has to wonder how the kids could 
gravitate toward them at all.  
“The Visit” might have hoped 
to withstand the fundamental flaws 
in its characters and be able to 
function on some basic level had 
it been able to deliver some solid 
scares. Sadly, it can’t even do that 
right.  The film fancies itself more 
of a horror-comedy, that eternally 
tricky sub genre that has sunk 
many a film in the past. The best 
horror-comedies work either as 
straight-up larks with the aesthetic 
and story trappings of horror 
cinema, or as genuinely affecting 
scary movies with light touches of 
dark humor.  
“The Visit” ends up 
uncomfortably in the middle, with 
scenes meant to be wholly sinister 
and others meant to be wholly 
comical coming back-to-back with 
little sense of flow or cohesion, and 

ultimately each of these only serve 
to diminish the other.  It is a shame 
because while most of the humor 
lands with a pronounced thud, 
a fair amount of the tension and 
drama is legitimately well done, 
seeming to indicate that the raw 
talent Shyamalan once displayed 
has not disappeared completely.
While Shyamalan the director 
might still be in there somewhere, 
Shyamalan the writer still seems 
to be out to lunch.  “The Visit” 
aspires to some lofty heights in 
terms of theme, using its pitch of 
being in a strange new place with 
people you are unfamiliar with 
to explore ideas about familial 
abandonment, guilt, and insecurity.  
Ambitions are to be commended, 
but in “The Visit” these themes 
never click. For all the tender 
and sometimes deeply affecting 
dramatic scenes the film has to 
offer, it has just as many scares 
that do not have anything to do 
with what the film is trying to say. 
That is how the film feels as 
a whole, a wasted opportunity.  
Still, the very fact that it feels like 
there was any opportunity in “The 
Visit” at all indicates a positive 
new direction for Shyamalan.  
After so many years of finding 
new and even deeper barrels to 
scrape the bottom of, that he has 
tried for something with the sort 
of character, atmosphere, and 
thematic ambition that once made 
him a young filmmaker of note is 
reassuring.  
“The Visit” may be a failure, but 
it feels like a noble failure, and for 
the first time in forever one feels 
safe looking forward to what is 
next from Shyamalan.

Who needs office hours?

PROFESSOR’S PODIUM

By ROSEMARY ARMAO

It sounds like heresy but 
here it is: Office hours are a 
waste of time.
We post our open-for-
business hours on our doors, 
publicize them in syllabi,  
keep track of them in required 
Faculty Activity Reports, and 
we camp out dutifully in our 
offices during our denoted 
visitation times.
And mostly we just wait 
around for students who do not 
come. Office hours mean alone 
time, a chance to grade papers, 
catch up on email, do our own 
writing. Sometimes somebody 
lost in the Humanities Building 
will knock at my door looking 
for directions. Men trying to 
buy back old texts or peddle 
new ones stop by. Exam time 
and registration bring in a few 
visitors, true. But mostly no 
one.
I thought it was something 
off-putting about me back 
in 2008 when I started at the 
University at Albany, but 
colleagues report the same 
lack of visitors. Then I figured 
that office hours were another 
outmoded idea like syllabi 
on paper that students ignore. 
They don’t need to visit on my 
schedule when they can text, 
email, tweet or call my cell 
phone.
But last May an English 
professor at Emory University 
wrote an op-ed in The New 
York Times asking “What’s 
the point of a professor?” 
Students, bemoaned Prof. Mark 
Bauerlein, no longer look up to 
professors as mentors or think-
ers whom they hope to learn 

from and emulate. Engagement 
beyond a couple hours a week 
in class and completing assign-
ments, he wrote, is minimal.
A third of freshmen re-
port that they never talk with 
professors outside of class, he 
wrote based on national statis-
tics, and a quarter of seniors 
don’t bother either.
  Response to his column 
was heated. Students never 
really adored professors, some 
commenters said. Others 
pointed out that professors 
nowadays are far busier than 
in the past because of heavier 
course loads and new demands 
that they supplement their own 
salaries with grants or, because 
they are adjuncts, are forced 
to work several jobs to keep 
health insurance in force and 
food on the table. And still 
others noted that students are 
different now from decades 
past when we were their age – 
less elite, more burdened with 
debt, less idealistic and more 
job focused. 
All of these detractors make 
good points. But I can’t help 
but be sad that most of our 
students don’t talk to us, but 
find us, to be brutally honest, 
mostly irrelevant to their cur-
rent lives and futures. I do re-
member thinking up questions 
as an excuse to sit in the office 
of especially brilliant teachers I 
wanted to hear more from. We 
were thrilled to be invited to 
retreats or off-campus meetings 
with professors who talked in 
those less-rigid settings about 
their own experiences and life 
strategies.
Not to get overly maudlin  
about the good-old days, but I 
have been thinking about what 

exactly professors could share 
of value with students who 
came to visit. Here’s my list.
1. We can teach and tutor 
you in areas where you are 
weak – grammar, strong writ-
ing and how to study in the 
case of my students. Office 
hour lessons are private and 
non-judgmental.
2. We can guide you in in-
terpreting those hideous audits 
and using them to craft a four-
year college career far richer 
than the gen-ed and minimum 
credits requirements that many 
students seem willing to settle 
for.
3. We can talk you off the 
ledge. We’ve seen plenty 
of students overworked and 
rattled by anxiety, trying to 
cram in too much in too little 
time. We’ve dealt with the 
grief, failure, and fear that too 
many students seem to think is 
unique unto them.
4. We are objective outsid-
ers, not your parents or your 
bosses, who can listen to ideas, 
give feedback, and help you 
plan a future you want.
And professor-student con-
versation ought not to be one 
way. I want to hear from my 
students about new artists, new 
technology, new TV programs 
and drinking games, new entre-
preneurial  ideas.
And if any of you can ex-
plain me how to use my remote 
control, I might be willing to 
discuss extra credit during of-
fice hours.

ment (rarmao@albany.edu).

Michel does not find the food in 
the dining halls to be as good as food 
served elsewhere on campus.
In her description on the petition, 
Michel mentioned how the lack of 
meal trades is changing her eating 
habits.
“My munch money decreases with 
every meal,” she said. “Because of 
this, I am limiting myself to fewer 
meals so that I can save my munch 
money. I barely eat at the dining hall 
because the food they serve isn’t as 
appetizing or fresh to me.”
Michel also mentioned that the 
dining hall hours are inconvenient 
for her. However, Indian Quad did 
receive extended dining hall hours to 
help accommodate students, accord-
ing to Pearse. 
Other students are disappointed 
in the meal options this semester as 
well.
“Meal trades were great, espe-
cially as an incoming freshman. I 
relied on these more than the dining 
hall,” said Teah Sisti, a junior. “It’s 
ridiculous that the school got rid 
of them. I know a lot of people are 
upset about it.”
Alison Shimel, a senior, says she 
did not get a meal plan at all this 
year because meal trades have been 
eliminated. 
The change in meal trades being 
offered has occurred over time. Meal 
trades have been lessened on meal 
plans over the last few years. 
“The meal plans that had meal 
trades had been reduced,” Pearse 
said. “The number of locations didn’t 
change, just the meal plans.”
Hope for students like Michel is 
not all lost. 
Pearse says that, in their prior 
form, meal trades will probably 
never come back to the UAlbany. 
However, alterations may be made to 
meal plans in the future.
“We’re looking at major changes 
to the meal plans when the Campus 
Center reopens,” he said. 

UAS is getting feedback from 
students to see what things should 
be changed, according to Pearse. 
They are also looking into what other 
campuses have done with their meal 
plans. 
“Students want a retail component. 
We understand that,” he said. “It’s 
just a matter of trying to figure out 
what’s the best way to get there.”

UAlbany junior Jed Shattuck said 
not having meal trades is a huge 
blow, particularly to upper classmen 
who remember the meal trades from 
a few years ago. He said finding 
meals is difficult now because now 
he has to be careful not to spend all 
of his Munch Money.
“It sucks because I do like the new 
addition to the campus center and I 
know that it takes money for projects 
like that but losing all the ameni-
ties we once had makes the dining 
experience a little less accessible 
every year.”

After 12 years as the head coach 
at Duquesne University, University 
at Albany head coach Greg Gattuso 
finally got a chance to compete 
against his old squad. 
His current squad was barely better 
on Saturday afternoon as UAlbany 
defeated Duquesne 17-14 in front of 
a crowd of 6,227 at Bob Ford Field. 
“It was the most difficult game 
in the world for me,” Gattuso said. 
“It was really weird. It was just not 
something you could prepare yourself 
for. It’s just odd.” 
The game started off favorably 
for the visiting Dukes as UAlbany 
(2-2) had to punt after just three plays 
on its opening drive. On their first 
drive, the Dukes (2-2) marched down 
the field. After multiple third down 
conversions, running back Rafiq 
Douglas dove into the end zone from 
a yard away for a touchdown to put 
Duquesne up 7-0. 
Late in the second quarter, 

UAlbany answered. On a first down 
play, UAlbany running back Elijah 
Ibitokun-Hanks scrambled and lost 
11 yards.
On second down and 21, UAlbany 
quarterback DJ Crook fired a deep 
pass toward receiver Brad Harris. 
Near the sideline, Harris made the 
34-yard touchdown catch in the end 
zone to put the crowd on its feet and 
put the Great Danes level on the 
scoreboard. 
“It was tough, I went out there, I 
ran by [the defender], I looked back, 
and the ball was right there. I turned 
around, put my arms up, and I got it,” 
Harris said.
Harris finished with a career-high 
122 yards receiving on seven catches.
As halftime approached, the Dukes 
regained their lead. Quarterback 
Dillon Buechel found top receiver 
Chris King for a 42-yard gain to the 
UAlbany nine-yard line. A couple 
plays later, Beuchel found King for a 
touchdown to give the Dukes a 14-7 
halftime lead.
“I told them, ‘We’re 
not playing well. They 
punched us in the face. 
Let’s see what kind of 
team we are.’ I was very 
curious to see how we 
would play in the second 
half,” Gattuso said of his 
message to his team at 
halftime. “They came out 
and fought their tails off 
and won the game and I’m 
proud of them.” 
In the third quarter, 
neither team could do 
anything on its first drive. 
Two minutes into the third 
quarter, UAlbany’s Jon 
Martin sent a punt high 
and deep toward Duquesne 
returner Bobby Guistine. 
Guistine couldn’t handle 
the ball, and UAlbany 
linebacker Julian Cox was 
able to recover the ball to 
get UAlbany possession. 
“These young guys keep 
going in and playing well,” 
Gattuso said. “Those kids 
stepped up. They were a 
little down and out this 
week and they went in and 
played their tails off.” 
On the ensuing drive, 
Crook found freshman 
receiver Zee Roberson for 
12 yards on third and 10 
to keep the drive going. 
A few plays later, Crook 
aired one out toward 
Roberson in the end zone. 
While being interfered, 
Roberson was able to 

make the diving catch for the game-
tying 29-yard touchdown. It was 
the first touchdown of Roberson’s 
college career. 
“Once the ball was in the air, in 
my mind it was mine, and I wasn’t 
going to be denied that,” Roberson 
said. “I just made sure that I got in 
position to make the catch.” 
“Our offense is still a work in 
progress. We’re still working on 
everything,” Crook said. “All that 
matters is that we got the win today.” 
Roberson finished the game 
eight catches for 71 yards and a 
touchdown. Crook finished 19-for-
32 passing for 261 yard and two 
touchdowns. 
Later in the third quarter, UAlbany 
was able to take the lead on a Patrick 
Toole 28 yard field goal, his first of 
the season. 
The rest of the game was a 
defensive battle, with neither team 
able to muster anything on offense. 
In the fourth quarter, Cox sacked 
Buechel to force a Duquesne punt. 
After UAlbany turned the ball over 
on downs with under a minute left, 
the Dukes had one last chance at a 
miracle. 
As time expired, Buechel’s final 
Hail Mary pass toward the end zone 
was intercepted by UAlbany safety 
Chris Johnson. 
For Duquesne, Buechel finished 
18-for-32 in the air for 213 yards 
and a touchdown. Douglas added 38 
yards on 13 carries on the ground. 
King led all players with 11 catches 
for 153 yards and a touchdown. 
UAlbany’s defense held the Dukes 
scoreless in the second half in the 
win. For UAlbany, running back 
Elliot Croskey was held to just 56 
yards on 24 carries. 
“The offense did well. The defense 
played an incredible second half,” 
Gattuso said. “We were fortunate to 
come out of here with a win today.” 
In their next game, UAlbany 
will travel to play Holy Cross on 
Saturday, Oct. 3 at 1 p.m. UAlbany 
defeated Holy Cross 14-13 last year 
in Gattuso’s first game as UAlbany 
head coach.

DANES DISPATCH DUKES

GREAT DANES FOOTBALL

By LAMYA ZIKRY

For a person who 
is constantly under 
the spotlight, Alana 
Brennan, goalkeeper for 
the University at Albany 
women’s soccer team, 
always finds a way to stay 
positive. 
“She is someone who, 
everyday, you can count 
on to have a smile on her 
face [and] go about her 
work enthusiastically,” said 
acting head coach Nick 
Bochette. “She does so 
and maintains that positive 
mentality while still 
striving to be the very best 
she can.” 
Maria Randazzo, 
Brennan’s friend and 
apartment-mate, said 
Brennan works just as hard 
off the field as she does 
on. Brennan is a human 
biology major and plans on 
going to graduate school 
to become a physical 
therapist. 
“She’s one of the most 
humble, down to earth 
people I’ve ever had the 
pleasure of knowing,” 
Randazzo said. 
Growing up Brennan 
played soccer every day. 
She enjoyed going to 
tournaments. “I knew my 
whole life that I wanted to 
go to college and play a 
Division I sport, and soccer 
ended up being my decision 
since freshman year of high 
school,” she said.
Brennan started playing 
soccer when she was 5 
years old. She also played 
basketball and softball, but 
soccer became her main 
sport and focus in high 
school. When she was 
younger, she hated playing 
goalie. 
“I just loved scoring 
goals, which is funny 
because now I never do 
that,” Brennan said. 
When Brennan was 
about 10, one of her 
coaches put her in the goal, 
and she’s been there ever 
since. 
“I love going one 
versus one against a 
player. Saving a shot or 
playing a tough game and 
keeping your team in it 
is the best feeling. They 
always say defense wins 
championships. I just love 
the pressure of being the 
one back there to save it,” 
Brennan said. “When I’m 
about to save it, I’m not 
nervous or anything. It’s 
so exciting when I save a 
nice shot because the whole 
team gets pumped up and it 

pushes them forward.”
Her coach is equally 
impressed with her play. 
“Alana is willing to take 
on new responsibilities, 
learn them and challenge 
her comfort zone and go 
well outside it to better 
herself and her team to put 
them in a better scenario to 
win,” Bochette said.
Brennan picked 
UAlbany because she really 
enjoyed the school, the 
girls on the team seemed 
close, and she liked the 
coaches. The coach that 
recruited Brennan had 
something in common with 
her, too -- they’re both 
short. 
“I thought it was cool. 
She was so small and she 
was going to recruit me 
when I’m a small goalie 
and it’s pretty hard to get 
recruited when you’re only 
5-foot-4 and there are girls 
that are close to 6-foot that 
some coaches prefer in the 
net,” Brennan said. 
She says it’s tough being 
a short goalkeeper. You 
have to be prepared to go 
against girls who are bigger 
and stronger. 
“On corner kicks and 
free kicks you just have to 
be fearless and ready to go 
up for it no matter what. 
I am small but I can get 
height when I jump. When 
I go up with my hands I’m 
taller than a lot of the girls 
that are just using their 
heads,” Brennan said.
Brennan started goal-
keeping halfway through 
the season her freshman 
year and has stayed in the 
position ever since. 
“It’s good to go against 
the odds,” Brennan said. 
“It’s exciting proving 
everyone wrong.”
Alana Olivieri, a fellow 
goalkeeper on the UAlbany 
squad, said that Brennan is 
one of the nicest girls she’s 
ever met. 
“As a goalkeeper, you 
have a different and special 
kind of relationship with 
each other. In practice, 
goalies are secluded in a 
way from the entire team. 
We really rely on each 
other for training and 
development,” Olivieri 
said.
So far this season, 
Brennan has played every 
second of the year in net 
for the Great Danes. She 
currently has a 5-5-1 record 
in UAlbany’s 11 games.
UAlbany’s next game is

Binghamton at Bob Ford
