CAMPUS EVENTS
#JUSTASK: HOW ELSE WILL YOU KNOW?

By LINDSEY RIBACK

A little rain could not keep 
University at Albany students 
from stopping by the #JustAsk 
Rally for Change on Wednesday 
to learn what they could do to 
end sexual violence on college 
campuses.
 The uptown campus #JustAsk 
Rally for Change took place 
in front of the Campus Center 
Fountain and drew in over 
1,000 people, both students and 
faculty, according to the Campus 
Programming Board. 
Rallies were also held on the 
Downtown Campus at Husted 
Hall Café and in the George 
Education Center Lobby on 
the East Campus. The Campus 
Programming Board hosted 
#JustAsk as part of their Podium 
Series, and tables featured campus 
organizations and services like 
Middle Earth, Project SHAPE, 
the Advocacy Center for Sexual 
Violence, and Mentors in 
Violence Prevention (MVP). 
“This is a way of getting 
people talking about the issue,” 
Carol Stenger, the director of 
the Advocacy Center for Sexual 
Violence and Project SHAPE, 
said. “The amount of violence that 
is occurring is appalling… the 
statistics are much too high.”
Senior Erin Hill, a Middle Earth 
volunteer, explained that even 
though rapes are under reported, 
students who are or have been 
victims of any type of sexual 
violence will still attend events 
like #JustAsk. After seeing the 
support from both the university 
and their peers, the victims will 
then seek help from the various 
university counseling and violence 
prevention programs. 
“This event is important because 
we should know how to protect 
ourselves, how to report it and 
how to react. Some people don’t 
know what to do. I know I don’t,” 
sophomore Timothy Seguia said. 
UAlbany is unique because it 

is the only SUNY campus with a 
stand-alone advocacy center and 
a full time Title IX coordinator, 
according to Stenger. 
By collaborating with the Office 
of the Title IX Coordinator as well 
as the sexual violence prevention 
organizations on campus, the 
programming board is working to 
ensure a safe living and learning 
environment for its students, as 
well as to educate students about 
their rights on and off campus.
“We live in a sheltered society 
that refuses to inform people about 

sexual violence due to it being 
uncomfortable to talk about. By 
informing people about sexual 
violence, less people will get 
hurt on and off campus,” Joseph 
Wozlonis, a sophomore, said. 
To raise awareness, each table 
was covered with flyers and 
pamphlets providing visitors with 
resources on how to recognize 
sexual violence, how to prevent it 
and where to go if they become a 
victim of sexual assault. The tables 
also offered free temporary tattoos, 
buttons and a t-shirt with the 

#JustAsk logo to raise awareness 
for the cause. 
Students were also invited to 
have their photos taken in front of 
a #JustAsk background holding 
up their personal messages on a 
whiteboard. They were encouraged 
to post their pictures on social 
media with the hashtag #JustAsk.
Sam Parra, a senior who works 
for Student Affairs, supported the 
campaign and the university’s 
incorporation of the hashtag.
“It’s good to use a hashtag 
because it gets people from other 

schools involved too,” Parra 
said. 
By the entrance to 
the Campus Center, the 
programming board set 
up a television playing a 
video for the campaign 
posted on their Facebook 
page. Titled “Join Us: The 
JustAsk Rally for Change,” 
it reminds viewers how 
common sexual violence 
is on college campuses: 
1 in 5 women and 1 in 33 
men are victims of sexual 
assault, and 1 in 3 students 
experience violence within 
a relationship. The video 
can be found on UAlbany’s 
YouTube account as well as 
their Facebook and Twitter 
pages.
Project Shape volunteer 
Kristen Azzopardi told a 
student visiting her table 
that “The only thing that 
can count as a consenting 
encounter is two consenting 
adults.” She continued on 
to explain that under New 
York state law, if a person is 
intoxicated in any way, they 
cannot legally consent to 
any sexual actions. 
“Just asking is something 
we should always do,” 
Edmund Timmons said. 
He is a graduate student and 
brother of Alpha Phi Alpha. 
As part of his fraternity, 
he participates in Project 
Alpha which promotes sexual 
health. Like Azzopardi, Timmons 
explained that individuals may feel 
as though lines, regarding what 
constitutes as consent, become 
blurred when alcohol becomes 
involved. 
To confidentially report an 
incident of sexual violence or 
to seek support, the Advocacy 
Center for Sexual Violence is open 
from 8:30 a.m. to 5 p.m. Monday 
through Friday and can be found 
in the Seneca Hall Basement on 
Indian Quad.

Former WNBA star shares mental 
health message with UAlbany

SPEAKER

By AARON CHERIS

On Tuesday night, the University at 
Albany welcomed former WNBA star 
Chamique Holdsclaw back to campus. 
After speaking at the school last 
year, Holdsclaw returned for a screen-
ing of her new documentary “Mind/
Game: The Unquiet Journey of 

Chamique Holdsclaw.”
Even though Holdsclaw has a Hall 
of Fame-worthy resume as a basket-
ball player, the event focused on her 
journey and mental health struggles 
throughout her career on and off the 
court. 
Coming out of high school in 
Queens, Holdsclaw was one of the 

top recruits in the nation. In 1995, she 
chose to attend the University of Ten-
nessee and play under legendary Head 
Coach Pat Summit. 
While at Tennessee, Holdsclaw led 
the Lady Vols to three straight national 
championships between 1996-98, the 
first time a women’s team had ever

STUDENT ATHLETE
A day in 
the life of 
Laini 
Leindecker

By CELIA BALF

What is a typical day like for a student-athlete 
at the University at Albany? It is very common 
to see, or even smell, a student-athlete from a 
mile away - they often travel in packs and drink 
out of bright, blue Powerade bottles. But behind 
the full sweatsuits and plates piled high with 
food is a student, too. 
Laini Leindecker is a junior from New Phila-
delphia, Ohio. Leindecker is a biology major as 
well as an outside hitter for the UAlbany volley-
ball team. A day with Leindecker starts well be-
fore most students even cue their coffee maker. 
She wakes up before 8 a.m. every morning.
“I don’t like to get used to sleeping in,” she 
said.
Her typical morning begins with a hearty bowl 
of oatmeal or scrambled egg whites. Leindecker 
even admits to putting “eat” on her to-do-list 
because her day gets that busy. 
“I’m a list maker,” she said. 
Leindecker aspires to be an occupational 
therapist one day. She admits to being stressed 
out at times, especially during her first couple of 
years in college. 
“My first two years it was stressful to go 
to practice, but this year I just focus all on 
volleyball for those three hours, four if it’s 
weights. It’s draining, but I focus my energy,” 
Leindecker said. 
She discussed how being present at each task 
and that task only is important. It is easy to be 
scattered when you’re trying to balance a sport, 
school, being president of the Student-Athlete 
Advisory Council (SAAC), and trying to have 
individual time too. Leindecker said that despite 
the stress of it all, being busy helps her. 
“Being busy helps me stay on track. You don’t 
have time to mess around,” Leindecker said. 
She even gives up Netflix during the school 
year, a sacrifice not many of us could say we 
would make. 
Volleyball practice lasts around three hours 
every day. This year practice is at night, and

WOMEN’S SOCCER

By AARON CHERIS

Soccer is widely regarded as the 
most popular sport in the world. 
Here at the University at Albany, 
student-athletes from all around the 
world are coming to the Capital Region 
to lead the Great Danes to victory in the 
game. 
“Soccer is a global language. Soc-
cer is something that brings everyone 
together,” UAlbany Head Coach Trevor 
Gorman said. 
The UAlbany roster includes players 
from five different countries, leading to 
a melting pot on the field, which Gor-
man said is similar to New York state 
itself.
So far, the results for the Great 
Danes have been good on the field. In 
10 games, UAlbany has five wins to go 

with four losses and a draw. 
However, the results wouldn’t be 
possible without the foreign Danes, 
who are led in scoring by a dynamic 
Brazilian duo. 
 Junior midfielder Leo Melgar and 
sophomore forward Afonso Pinheiro 
have combined for 12 of the team’s 14 
goals this season. Both started play-
ing at a young age in the country that 
hosted the most recent FIFA World 
Cup in 2014. 
“In Brazil, we are practically born 
with a soccer ball in our feet,” Melgar 
said. “I had pictures playing with a soc-
cer ball at a young age.”
After years of playing in the streets 
and with club teams, players had to 
make tough decisions on how to con-
tinue their careers, and the path from 
Brazil to UAlbany was waiting. 

“There’s a good tradition of Bra-
zilians coming to the United States 
now,” Gorman said. “It’s become more 
popular in Brazil as they found out that 
there were ways to continue soccer 
development while also getting a high 
level education.” 
Melgar was one of the first Great 
Danes to come from Brazil. In 2013, 
he came to UAlbany with defender 
Bernardo Mattos, as the two had known 
each other back home. 
The next year, Pinheiro and mid-
fielder Pedro Espindola joined the 
UAlbany squad. 
“Coach saw me playing on a DVD 
and I started to talk to him through 
Skype and he convinced me this would 
be the best idea. I talked to my parents 
and I decided it would be a great idea to

With Krista Fitzpatrick assisting goals for 
the University at Albany Women’s Soccer 
team, UAlbany defeated Binghamton 2-1 
on Thursday night, Oct. 1 in the conference 
home opener at Bob Ford Field.
Fitzpatrick set a new assists record for 
the program. It was between Fitzpatrick, 
Schneider, and Kiana Rugar. 

“It’s exciting to set a new program re-
cord. We were close all season so we were 
joking around on who’s going to beat it 
first. And it’s our first conference win so it 
feels really good,” Fitzpatrick said.
Head Coach Caitlin Cucchiella said she’s 
happy to get the win. She thinks the weather 
played a a factor in how they came out but 
it’s a good learning experience for them. 
“It wasn’t our best performance but we 

found a way to win and get the result,” she 
said.
Out of 10 shots on goal for Binghamton 
(1-9-1, 0-2-0 AE), Alana Brennan saved 
nine. UAlbany (6-5-1, 1-0-1 AE) didn’t 
have as many shots, but were able to score 
two.
Schneider thinks it’s really positive that 
they were able to pull out the 2-1 win. “It 
definitely wasn’t our best game, but to be 

able to pull out a win when we weren’t our 
best is still a really positive thing,” she said. 
She says they trained really hard on set 
pieces and crosses. Both their goals came 
off set pieces which she says shows what 
they had done in practice worked.
Albany managed to pick up a few corner 
kicks in the sixth minute but the attempts

DANES SAY WHAT?

“I would be shocked... Tobacco is legal. If you 
are of age, you should be able to smoke it freely, 
especially since we have an open campus. There 
are a lot of places where you can smoke and it 
won’t affect people. If UAlbany does choose 
to start enforcing tobacco rules, they should 
be more strict when it comes to areas where 
students are able to smoke. Otherwise, I think 
tobacco on the campus is not a problem.” 

- Clinton Olaniyi, Class of 2018

This week, we asked students: 

The University at Buffalo recently banned smoking on 
campus. How would you feel if UAlbany did the same?

Compiled by Vaughnee 
Simmons

“I would think it is too much of a drastic change. 
I do think that UAlbany should be more strict 
when it comes to smoking near the academic 
buildings. During classroom hours, it is a pain 
to smell tobacco and other fumes when walking 
on the podium or sitting in the classroom next 
to a window. As long as students and faculty are 
mindful of others, I don’t think having tobacco on 
the UAlbany campus is a problem.”

- Raphael Henriquez, Class of 2015

“I would be fine with UAlbany banning 
tobacco on campus. It is the way of 
the future. You see, before I was born, 
people were allowed to smoke indoors 
and on planes, which now is not allowed. 
Banning smoking in certain places is the 
new wave. It keeps everybody healthy. 
Today in society, everyone is more 
conscious of health. I think it would be 
great to have a smoke free campus.”

- David Darang, Class of 2015

EDUCATION

By MEGHAN MAHAR

This September, the University at Albany 
was given the title “Engine of Opportunity” 
by the White House in a new online college 
scorecard.It was given this title due to its 
accessibility and economical costs for low-
income students. 
“Being recognized by the White House 
as an Engine of Opportunity affirms the 
University at Albany’s long history of 
providing high quality, affordable higher 
education to a diverse group of students,” 
President Robert J. Jones stated in a press 
release following the announcement. 
“We’re proud that at least 30 percent of our 
student body will be the first in their fami-
lies to earn a four-year degree.”
The news release also stated that in order 
for an institution to fall under the Engine of 
Opportunity category, they must serve an 
above-average share of Pell recipients. Pell 
Grants are often given to students who can-
not afford to pay all or most of their college 
expenses, one of the most common reasons 
students are unable to attend college.
As the College Scorecard showed, 
UAlbany makes it possible for low-income 
students to still obtain a college education 
while also lessening the loan money a stu-
dent would otherwise need to borrow from 
the federal government. Because grants, un-
like loans, do not need to be repaid, this also 
helps ease the amount of student loan debt, 
thus allowing more students to maintain 
financial security after graduation. 
The Office of the Press at the White 
House released a fact sheet encouraging 
students to research colleges to find the one 
that is right for them. This sheet included 
information about the College Scorecard.
“At a time when America needs colleges 

to focus on affordability and supporting all 
students who enroll, many existing college 
rankings reward schools for spending more 
money and rejecting more students,” the 
report said.
This is what President Obama wishes to 
change, according to the report. While some 
students prepping for college might think 
that the schools that are more selective or 
cost more money each year are the ones that 
will benefit them in the future but, with the 
creation of that College Scorecard, students 
can see that this is not necessarily true. 
The scorecard offers grades for more than 
3,500 colleges in the United States based 
on average annual cost, graduation rate, and 
salary after attending. UAlbany fared well. 
The average annual cost is just under 
$16,000, less than most private schools and 
even other public schools in the country. 
Even amongst SUNY schools, UAlbany has 
a cheaper average annual cost. For example, 
SUNY Binghamton has an average cost of 
almost $1,000 more per year, and SUNY 
Cortland is $2,000 more. However, UAl-
bany is not the cheapest, as schools such as 
SUNY Buffalo, SUNY Potsdam and SUNY 
Delhi are thousands of dollar less per year. 
The average annual salary of a student 
who graduates from UAlbany accord-
ing to the online scorecard is $50,900 and 
the graduation rate at the university is 65 
percent. Both of these rates are above the 
national average, but are not the highest in 
the SUNY system. SUNY Binghamton has 
the highest graduation rate among SUNY 
schools at 80 percent and SUNY Downstate 
Medical Center has the highest salary after 
graduation at $121,500.

college scorecard website

Albany defenders of free speech dare to read banned books

By PATRICK DAY TINE
A

bout 40 defenders of 
free speech turned out 
on Wednesday night 
at the main branch of 
the Albany Public Library for the 
New York Civil Liberties Union’s 
(NYCLU) annual “Banned Books 
Read Out.” The event featured 
11 volunteers from around the 
Capital District reading passages 
from books frequently challenged 
around the United States. 
The volunteers read from a 

variety of challenged texts. James 
Yeara, a longtime English and 
acting teacher at Bethlehem High 
School, read a scene about sex be-
ing a “political act” from George 
Orwell’s “1984,” a volume that 
has been a mainstay on banned 
books lists for decades. Melanie 
Young, a state employee and new 
mother, read Shel Silverstein’s po-
ems, “Blame” and “Little Abigail 
and the Beautiful Pony” from his 
collection, “A Light in The Attic.” 
This might sound like tame 
fare, but the book has been chal-

lenged on the grounds that it en-
courages childhood disobedience, 
and one hysterical school district 
in Wisconsin accused Silverstein 
of “glorifying Satan, suicide and 
cannibalism.” 
Bob Resnick, an assistant 
librarian at the APL and a local 
musician, read from the most chal-
lenged book of the year, a young 
adult title called “The Absolutely 
True Diary of a Part-Time Indian” 
by Sherman Alexie. Though the 
passage that Resnick picked was

CAREER
Networking 101: UCAN connect to alumni for help

By RUSSELL OLIVER

“No one gets ahead without 
a mentor or guide,” said Phil 
Rosenthal, professor of pediatrics 
and surgery at the University of 
California, and an alum of the 
University at Albany. “This net-
work can help prepare students for 
their future with knowledge from 
someone in the know.”
This is exactly what the UAl-
bany Career Advisory Network 
can do for this university. Also 
known as UCAN for short, this 
free online network can connect 
students to thousands of alumni 
to get guidance for their future 

careers.
Rosenthal, like many other 
alumni members of the network, 
have been a part of UCAN for 
years. 
“I’ve been a part of the network 
for about six years,” Martin 
Bender, who works with U.S. 
Border Protection, said.
Melissa Samuels, director of 
Alumni Programs, said UCAN 
is a great resource for students. 
The network allows students to 
connect with alumni from around 
the world to ask about interviews, 
advice, and networking. Students 
can seek advice about everything 
from career paths options to future 

job insights. UAlbany also up-
dates the UCAN homepage with 
upcoming alumni events and news 
about the university’s alumni.
“Students are making key 
connections and building that all-
important professional network,” 
Samuels said about the network.
The UCAN network was started 
back in 2012 and had around 
700 alumni advisors. Now they 
have more than 2,000 advisors 
from countries across the world 
in various industries. There have 
been over 1,000 connections made 
between students and alumni 
through UCAN since the network 
launched.

All of the alumni who are apart 
of the network are volunteers. 
“They realize they are in a unique 
position to give back and make a 
difference in the life of a student,” 
Samuels said.
The UCAN was created when 
the Alumni Association started 
to receive requests from students 
to connect with alumni in their 
prospective career fields. Making 
connection between the two was a 
slow and difficult process, so the 
Alumni Association decided to 
create an online network for it. 
“I think the network helps 
students to see what the real world 
looks like, both good points and 

bad,” Bender said. “It’s also help-
ful to remind them that nobody 
starts at the top, and it’s important 
to listen while learning from the 
ground up.”
Steve Rogan, a member of the 
UCAN network and director of 
research at NBC Universal, agrees 
with Bender on the network’s 
usefulness. 
“The network gives students 
access to people in the field they 
are interested in and allows them 
the opportunity to get informa-
tional interviews, ask questions, 
ask for advice and gain a mentor,” 
he said.

The plates include multiple 
representations of the highly 
controversial Confederate flag. 
While this flag has often been 
considered symbolic of racism, 
it is still represented on current 
Georgia license plates today. 
   While this is not the required 
license plate for the state, that 
it is even an option for a license 
plate shows the problems relating 
to racism and intolerance that 
continue to emerge 
   The atrocious tragedy of the 
Charleston shootings sparked a 
redesign in these license plates. 
During the evening prayer service 
of June 17, Dylan Roof opened 
gunfire on the Emmanuel African 
Methodist Episcopal Church. 
During the attack, Roof killed 
nine innocent African-American 
churchgoers who were at the 
service. In the aftermath of his 
horrendous hate crime, Roof was 
arrested and pleaded not guilty to 
the events.
   Photos of Roof holding guns 
with the Confederate flag in the 
background began to surface on 
the Internet after his arrest. Roof 
also released his own manifesto, 
which talks about his “white 
supremacy leanings.” Roof 

clearly believes in the racism 
and intolerance that surrounds 
the Confederate flag. On Sept. 
3, 2015 Roof was sentenced to 
the death penalty on federal hate 
crime charges.
   Soon after this tragedy, Georgia 
officials decided it was time to 
redesign the license plate and 
cut down on the display of the 
Confederate flag. They halted the 
sale of the Sons of Confederate 
Veterans plates in June after 
the Charleston shooting. Gov. 
Nathan Deal officially ordered 
the redesign in June, however 
representatives from multiple 
states such as North Carolina, 
Virginia, and Tennessee have 
announced this summer that 
their goal is to phase out the 
confederate flag from their 
license plates as well. 
   The symbol of the Confederate 
flag has been a major issue in 
the fight against racism in the 
United States. The depiction of 
the flag has been making history 
in recent years as many states 
and companies have limited its 
presence. For example, Wal-Mart 
has removed all merchandise 
emblazoned with the Confederate 
flag and Apple has eliminated 
every app that has any sign of 

Confederate imagery. This has 
created a mixed reception from 
the general public. 
   I, however, agree with these 
decisions. The Confederate flag 
is not something that needs to 
be shown because it represents 
a time of racism in our country. 
Georgia should have followed in 
the examples of its fellow states 
and phased it out as well.
   According to Time magazine, 
3,500 drivers have already 
ordered the redesigned plate that 
still features the Confederate 
flag. The Sons of Confederate 
Veterans themselves have said 

they’ve seen a spike in interest in 
the plate. 
   The new plate is almost 
identical. The only difference 
is that the background has been 
removed: it still features a 
Confederate flag.
   The fact that Georgia has 
decided to continue to include 
the Confederate flag on their 
newly redesigned license plate is 
ridiculous, offensive, distasteful 
and flat-out racist, especially 
after the events in Charleston 
this past June. The redesign of 
the plate was announced due to 
this tragedy, and because of it, 

the new plates shouldn’t have 
the Confederate flag displayed, 
period. 
   Georgian officials decided 
to tone down the imagery on 
the plate because of how the 
Confederate flag was negatively 
linked to the Charleston tragedy. 
In that case, why even keep 
any signs of the flag on the 
redesigned license plate at all? 
   If you ask me, this is hypocrisy. 
This license plate is another 
ignorant reason of how some 
states’ governments do not 
account for racism’s prevalence 
in this country. C’mon Georgia!

T

he state of Georgia has always offered an 
alternative to their traditionally peachy 
license plate. This alternative is particularly 
used by members of the Sons of Confederate 
Veterans.

“So, which colleges did you get into?” 
 “Do you like it?” 
“What are you studying?” 
From high school until college 
graduation, everyone and their mother 
want to know the details of one’s academic 
life. And sometimes one can answer these 
questions, and sometimes one just doesn’t 
want to. But of all the questions asked, one 
of them is especially stressful. 
“What am I going to major in? What do I 
want to do with my life?”
Now we have to think. 
We have to think about the now and the 
future, and not just tomorrow or next week. 
We have to think years down the road.
What job do I want? Which major is 
going to get me there? What if I want to 
change my mind? As a sophomore, I’ve 
changed my mind several times within the 
last two-and-a-half semesters, and I know 
this is not an easy question to answer.
I came in as a freshman, undecided 
and free to explore. But everyone I knew 
had already picked their majors, and were 
deep into their respective requirements. 
The psychology students were taking their 
prerequisites, and the anthropology and 
English majors were deep into their classes. 
I knew I wanted to interact with people. 
I didn’t want to sit at a desk all day and 
have more connection with my computer 
screen than the people around me. I knew 
I liked psychology, so I considered being a 
therapist. But wait -- maybe I wanted to be 
a teacher? I could also be a lawyer. After 
all, my uncle once told me that I didn’t 
need to major in anything special to go to 
law school. 
“You could major in underwater basket 

weaving,” he said. A nice thought, but I 
had a feeling I didn’t want to spend my 
hard earned tuition dollars on that.
My biggest concern was that I really 
didn’t know what I wanted to be when I 
grew up, and I didn’t want whatever major 
I chose to hold me back once I graduated. 
How could I choose just one thing when 
there were so many things I wanted to do? 
How could I major in math, if maybe I 
wanted to be a doctor? How could I major 
in anthropology if I wanted to go into 
business?
Now, I realize that things aren’t that 
strict. Many jobs do require certain areas 
of study, but many don’t. Many master’s 
programs don’t require certain bachelor’s 
degrees. If I want to get a master’s 
in public policy, I can do that with a 
bachelor’s in Spanish. It’s quite freeing to 
think about it this way.
At the moment, I’m double majoring 
in English and psychology. At one point, 
anthropology, history, and political science 
had made their ways onto my list, but I’ve 
settled for these two, and I think I’m happy 
with my choice. Enjoying a few classes 
isn’t how you should choose your major. 
I chose my majors because they made me 
think, and read, and write. They make me 
think about people, and who and what we 
are. 
I’m not majoring in English and 
psychology to get certain jobs. I’m 
majoring in them because they intrigue me 
and because they are helping me grow as a 
person. I’ll find the right career when I’m 
ready to take that next step. But for right 
now, I need to figure out me. 
So I would say not to stress too much 
on picking the “right major.” Eventually a 
career will make itself known.

very university has its own bill 
of rights for its students. The 
University at Albany has gone a step 
further, placing a large sign on the 
podium detailing the rights that students 
have on campus.
Some of these rights include: being able 
to make a report to local law enforcement 
or state police, protection from retaliation 
by the institution, any student, the accused 
or respondent and their friends, family 
and acquaintances that are within the 
jurisdiction of the institution, and the 
exercise of civil rights and practice of 
religion without interference.
These rights are generally in line with 
the rights that we have as human beings in 
the United States. Therefore I think that it is 
important, if not crucial, that we know what 
these rights are at all times. 
“People don’t look this stuff up, and in 
the case of an emergency it needs to be 
accessible,” Kay Broughton, SUNY System 
Communication intern and UAlbany 
student, said. 
She explained that the SUNY system 
has just launched a database that helps to 
prevent sexual assault and offers resources 
on what to do in the aftermath.
I do commend the university for 
plastering these rights on a giant glass case 
board on the podium. I commend them for 
making it visible to the public and, more 
specifically, the student body. I commend 
them for understanding that as students and 
as people, this is something that needs to be 
broadcasted and made visible to us. 
The only thing I question is… why now?
For years I have passed by this board 
and have only seen UAlbany alum Carolee 
Carmello, the Broadway star, as the image 
that UAlbany students should aspire to be, 
along with other alum including human 
rights activist Harvey Milk and “Wicked” 
author, Gregory Maguire. 
The university is shifting its focus less 
on the success of the graduates of UAlbany 
and more on what the current students need 
to know. Perhaps the university is taking 
a more proactive approach to handle any 
sexual harassment or assault cases on and 

off campus. 
There have been some cases of theft and 
assault in the downtown area according to 
recent emails sent out by the university. 
It seems as though the university wants to 
maintain a solid image of itself as a campus 
that cares about its students’ well being. 
And while I do not think that the campus 
does not care about its students, it just 
seems as though the university is trying too 
hard.

Nevertheless, I fully support the 
university promoting the awareness of 
students’ rights on campus. I only hope that 
students will read the podium board and 
learn the rights that they have.
It is now becoming more crucial for 
people, especially students, to know that 
they have specific rights that need to be 
upheld by both the university and the city 
of Albany.  
The university is allowing for easily 
accessible rights for the students on campus 
and it is now taking the necessary steps to 
improve awareness and to prevent unlawful 
harassment and assault on campus. 
UAlbany is taking a progressive step 
forward in a very subtle way.

Out with the old and in with 
the now: Learning your rights

ACADEMICSON CAMPUS
A ‘major’ effect on one’s 
career and future

Janie Frank / Albany Student Press

   Though I cannot give my 
full support to either side, I 
sympathize with Trayvon Martin, 
as death should never have been 
the end result. 
   The media have warped these 
two and made compelling 
arguments for both sides. 
I’ve heard that Martin was a 
delinquent. He was said to have 
had a record, which was later 
dispelled by the authorities 
according to the Associated Press, 

and had a bad 
reputation, which 
could be why 
Zimmerman kept 
an eye on him. 
   On the other 
hand, Zimmerman 
has overreacted 
to some situations, like calling the 
police for minor cases or things 
that seemed wrong only to him. 
   With that being said, a person 
with poor judgment confronted 
Martin. And each side continues 
to add on. The question that gets 
prioritized is who triggered the 
other. What we should focus on 
is the horrible ending of it all. 
Death should not have resulted 
from this. A gun should not have 

been brought up in this scenario. 
But it was, and in the courts it was 
justified. For some odd reason it 
was self-defense. 
   However, Zimmerman embraces 
his act, saying that it wasn’t an act 
of self-defense. 
   If it was an act of self-defense, 
there would not have been any 
other reason to react other than 
the presence of clear danger. 
Preconceived thoughts that are 
not based on facts, but are instead 
based on stereotypes, should not 
justify self-defense. Prejudice 
isn’t self-defense. And if there 
is one thing Zimmerman is, it is 
prejudiced. 
   His Twitter account, 
@TherealGeorgeZ, is an abundant 

display of his biases. Tweets 
include: “Gee... I sure hate 
offending people that have plotted 
and tried to kill and my family…” 
and “Cops lives matter, black 
slime doesn’t.” 
   Included in some of his tweets 
was a “WhiteLivesMatter” tag, 
which doesn’t acknowledge the 
oppression and damage done to 
black lives, but instead implies 
that white lives are the ones at 
risk.  
   Both tweets from September, so 
recent and relevant, amplify how 
he does target black lives and, to 
this day, is criticizing them. 
   Zimmerman’s personal tweets 
are nothing compared to what he 
retweeted. Martin’s dead body 
was retweeted with the caption 
“Z-man is a one man army.” 
   I’m furious that there are people 
applauding Zimmerman’s actions. 
I’m furious because I know 
Zimmerman could have tweeted 
this himself, yet he settled for a 
retweet. He obviously agreed with 
what the person said by retweeting 
it. 
   So why didn’t he tweet it 
himself? Maybe he thought it was 
a way to seem less offensive, and 
to portray that he has supporters. 
Nevertheless, I’m furious because 
to me, this confirms that Martin 
was killed by and because of 
an extremely biased man. This 
retweet is saying “I’m finally 
getting praise for my prejudiced 
act.” 
   I don’t know what’s worse: 
Zimmerman being glorified with 
the name “Z-man,” or that he was 
compared to an army. Armies 
fight intentionally, yet I thought 
his act of self-defense was just a 
last minute reaction. 
   Zimmerman’s retweet shows 
that he takes pride in killing an 
unarmed teenager. 

L

et’s set the record straight: 
the media has butchered 
the Trayvon Martin-George 
Zimmerman incident.

verybody’s favorite talking anthropomorphic 
puppets are back for the new half-hour ABC 
comedy series, “The Muppets.” 
The lovable group, first created by 
puppeteer Jim Henson over 40 years ago, has become 
an American icon. Since then, Kermit and the gang have 
appeared in multiple television series and eight different 
films. The recent reboot to the series, the successful 2011 
film “The Muppets,” was the leading force that made 
producers decide to bring “The Muppets” back to the 
television.
The pilot episode of “The Muppets” aired Tuesday 
Sept. 22 on ABC. The show follows the behind-the-scenes 
of the fictional talk show “Up Late with Miss Piggy,” 
with Kermit acting as producer. Many other popular 
Muppet characters work on the show including the species 
ambiguous Gonzo as head writer and Fozzie Bear as 
Piggy’s sidekick and announcer, much like Steve Higgens 
is to Jimmy Fallon.
“The Muppets” follows a mockumentary-style series 
approach, heavily drawing from influences from the 
popular NBC show “The Office.” The use of cutaway 

segments to one-on-one interviews is used as it gives the 
Muppet characters a chance to give extra commentary. 
“You tell the camera how you really fell, and then it 
cuts back to you saying something completely different. 
I hate these interviews!” Fonzo declares, before the show 
cuts back to him in the group with Fonzo promptly saying, 
“I love these interviews!”
The show also draws influences from other shows such 
as the show-within-the-show approach of “30 Rock.” 
The syndicate late night talk show aspect is obviously 
influenced from NBCs “The Tonight Show.”
Old-school Muppets fans may be shocked by some 
of the adult-themed jokes never before seen with these 
Muppets. The dramatic breakup between Kermit and Miss 
Piggy was a big surprise. This acted as a nice narrative 
push that made viewers think deeper into the Kermit and 
Piggy romance than ever before.
Kermit maturely jokes about ‘cross-promoting’ with his 
new girlfriend Denise, who is also a pig. 
“What can I say?” Kermit admitted. “I’m attracted to 
pigs.”
The show also does a great job of carrying over the 
personalities of each Muppet to represent their job on the 
show. Of course, Miss Piggy is the diva who is the host 

of the show, Kermit is the man in charge who is doing 
his best to keep the show from falling apart (a nod to Liz 
Lemon from “30 Rock” is when Kermit mentions his 
stress eating). However, one detract from the show is that 
viewers who are unfamiliar with the characters may not 
find them as humorous as most of the jokes are character 
driven.
As usual for a Muppets production there are guest stars 
galore. The pilot episode included guests Elizabeth Banks, 
Imagine Dragons, fitness entrepreneur Tray Anderson, and 
“Dancing with the Stars” host Tom Bergeron. More big 
names are planning to drop by in upcoming episodes such 
as Josh Groban, Jennifer Lawrence, Sofia Vergara, and 
Liam Hemsworth.
The voiceover work and puppeterring is also top notch. 
The series is shot in Burbank, CA at the Walt Disney 
Studios. All of the sets are required to be raised four-and-
a-half feet so that the puppeteers can have enough space to 
work. Multiple long-time Muppeteers work on the show, 
including Bill Barretta, Eric Jacobson, Dave Goelz, and 
Steve Whitmore who also voice the plethora of characters 
on the show.
“The Muppets” airs every Tuesday night at 8 p.m. on 
ABC.

The exhibit, which opened Sept. 4, contains art from seven different video games designed by studios all over the world.

Gamers rejoice: your passions have been turned into art.
The video game realm lies in a peculiar limbo between 
the tangible and the illusory. One cannot hold the end 
product of a video game, such as graphics and characters, 
in one’s hand because they are digital. If we reduce the 
criteria of art down to one simple rule, it is not art if it 
is tangibly conducive to another purpose, then we may 
consider the video game to be art after all.
What a way it has come. Most may fondly remember 
the archetypal Super Mario Bros. and Pac-Man games. 
These modest beginnings were perhaps some of the first 
video games to take aesthetic into account, as they began 
including themes and “worlds.” The “worlds” of the video 
games shown at the Opalka Gallery at Sage University 
encompassed an obscenely new and beautiful standard of 
video game design.
“From Concept to Console: Art and Aesthetics in 
Video Game Design” began showing at the college 
gallery on Sept. 4 and continued throughout the month. 
The show displayed the art and origins of seven video 
games and their artists. The design studios hailed from all 
over the world including the United States, Sweden, the 
Czech Republic, and the U.K. Aesthetic ranged from as 
minimalist as a white screen can be to as cluttered as you 
may imagine the brains of these artists may be. 
The way the creators of “Machinarium,” a puzzle 
point-and-click adventure game, drained their resources to 
produce a simpler second game, “Botanicula,” insinuating 
what must be the exhaustive nature of video game design. 

For these video game artists, obsession and exhaustive 
design is the name of the game. A perfect and beautiful end 
product for these artists can only be the product of tedious 
work. 
If we consider the end product to be the thing to 
criticized, then we may say that of all the games shown in 
the gallery, “Skylanders: Swap Force” was a belly flop. 
The intentions implied by the concept drawings were some 
of the most captivating. Soft-edged yet vibrant landscapes 
full of contrast grabbed the attention of the gallery-goer 
from the door, even at the back of the room. Yet, of all 
the concepts, this game had the steepest degradation on 
its way to execution. With all the promise it showed, and 
the budget at its finger tips, “Skylander’s” end product – 
demonstrated by the trailer provided – showed the roughest 
edges and was a sore-eye for the lover of aesthetic and fun. 
It seemed to have devolved a decade or two in the way of 
artistry and design.
“Botanicula,” “Transistor,” and “Tengami” showed the 
greatest elevation from intention and concept to execution. 
Like the resources of the artist may run out from game 
to game, perhaps the artists conceptual capabilities are 
limited too and must be parceled out in order to leave the 
more beautiful products for the end. Successfully executed, 
these games rendered some of the cleanest lines, sharpest 
images, and most charming story lines (if a charming story 
line is important to your video game criteria). 
“Botanicula” took the soft-edged yet vibrant concepts 
of “Skylanders” and implemented them into the finished 
product with the most integrity. Though simpler in their 
approach compared to other examples, the artists at 

Amanita Design produced a stunning game. 
The artists of “Transistor” claim the most overt artistic 
inspiration, admitting their attachment to Gustav Klimt. 
This gothic example of a heroin was advanced further by 
the lack of her sexualization, a trend (only temporarily 
paused by the “Metroid” series) which many know 
has weighed down females in video games. The game 
succeeded in producing a vibrant and even sexy landscape.  
The most category-less game displayed at the show 
was undoubtedly “The Dream Machine.” The brain child 
of Anders Gustafsson and Erik Zaring, of the Swedish 
studio Cockroach Inc., combined the tangibility of hand 
crafted artworks with the intangibility of a virtual game. 
Their characters and landscapes, hand made by the pair 
using mostly clay and other house hold items, conveyed 
the most meta message of the whole show. Dreams, which 
seem so real to us in our sleep, are simply fabrications 
of an overactive sleeping brain. The Dream Machine’s 
combination of materials and digital rendering supplied an 
eerie echo for the gallery-goer to admire. Would this game 
be performance art perhaps, since these tangible materials 
did in fact serve a purpose? Or would our definition of 
art require an expansion to accommodate this exceptional 
example?
Definitions aside, an artist’s intent is always considered 
first. For video games the end product should be judged 
by the scale assumed in the concept model.  The layout of 
“From Concept to Console: Art and Aesthetics in Video 
Game Design” was more reminiscent of a museum than 
of an art show, and displayed that scale to the viewer with 
both remarkable and devastating results.

Fiction writer Ann Beattie and “Salmagundi” editor and 
poet Peg Boyers spoke about their respective works, their 
shared passion for writing and also gave advice to hopeful 
writers during a seminar on Sept. 29 in the Standish Room 
at the Science Library, their visits being coordinated by the 
New York State Writers Institute.
Beattie has written several short stories including “Park 
City” (1998) and “The New Yorker Stories” (2011) as well 
as several novels like “Chilly Scenes of Winter (1976), 
“Picturing Will” (1989), and “Mrs. Nixon: A Novelist 
Imagines a Life” (2011). She has won the 2000 REN/
Malamud Award for Excellence in the Short Story, as well 
as the 2005 REA Award for the Short Story. She has been 
featured in John Updike’s “The Best American Short Stories 
of the Century” (2000), and “The Best American Short 
Stories” (2014) by Jennifer Egan. She has even had an entire 
generation named after her called “Beattieland” which is 
notable for being a countercultural milieu.
Boyers is an editor for the “Salmagundi” magazine, 
which is celebrating its 50th anniversary this year. Born 
in Venezuela to Cuban and Irish parents, Boyers spent her 
childhood traveling the world, living in places like Libya, 
Indonesia, Cuba, and Italy. When she was an adolescent, 
she fell in love with the Italian city of Venice. She was so 
inspired by the city that three of her collections centered 
around Italy, notably “Hard Bread” (2002), “Honey With 
Tobacco” (2007), and “To Forget Venice” (2014). Boyers 
currently teaches creative writing at Skidmore College.
Beattie encouraged writers to never give up despite not 
always getting recognition right away, although she still 
acknowledged that “we want to think that brilliance is 
appreciated” at some point. She said that people don’t get 
to see anything unless the work is published. She used the 
example of fellow writer Edith Pearlman, who has been 
writing for years and yet has only recently been recognized 
by literary enthusiasts for her work. 
Beattie said that a writer must first “approve of oneself” 
and not elsewhere. Both writers believed that aspiring 
writers should not care too much about the public’s or 

critics’ reactions to their works. One’s work should satisfy 
oneself and not necessarily everyone else. Boyers added 
that a good writer also “reads and rereads.”
Boyers then jumped in with a story of a group of women, 
who were truly passionate about writing, continuously 
attending a writers’ workshop even though were told by 
the instructor that they should just give up. Boyers said the 
women were furious, and rightly so, but they ignored the 
instructor’s words.
Beattie, who has written short stories, said that she was 
always an avid reader and as she grew up. She said she 
“loved books more and more.” 
“The world you know is largely the world you think 
about,” she said while discussing how she chooses her 
subject matter. “[I] can’t have my attention directed [at just 
one subject].” 
She acknowledges that a writer could write whatever his 
or her mind fixates up, and she personally uses real places 
and information in her work so that she won’t “have to 
come up with names.” 
Both Beattie and Boyers agreed that focusing on just one 
subject for inspiration only limits one’s creativity and it 
“makes you arrive at a predetermined conclusion.” 
Boyers also warned that just because one is familiar with 
something, one shouldn’t “assume you know everything 
about it”.
Regarding word selection, Boyers said that it “varies 
from poem to poem” and editing also affects the process. 
Beattie then described that she tends to write late at 
night and she has to have the “right things on the desk, and 
in the right configuration”: a number of bird figurines, a 
telephone, and a shoe filled with paper clips, all of which 
are arranged to her personal liking on her desk. 
Boyers talked about her multiple writings in Venice, 
saying that it stemmed from “a lifetime obsession” with 
the city. She’s been frequently visiting the Italian city for 
50 years. Beattie also talked about why she chose to write 
about Maine, saying that she wanted to “de-mystify” the 
city, and all of the stereotypes of people eating lobster every 
night and such.

Leindecker likes this timeslot 
more because it gives her more 
flexibility with classes. A vol-
leyball practice generally starts 
out with a good portion dedicated 
to film and scouting the team 
they will be competing against, a 
skill and tactic-oriented portion, 
and then a competitive part that 
prepares the team for situa-
tions that could happen in the 
match. Leindecker adds an hour 
to her practice before and after 
to receive treatment on nagging 
injuries.
“Do I want to pursue volleyball 
past my four years? Yes. Can my 
body handle it? No,” Leindecker 
said. 
This junior captain has been 
nursing nagging injuries since 
joining the team. The amount of 
time she spends taking care of her 
body in a week may exceed the 
time college students study for a 
final exam. 
It is an easy assumption to 
think athletes just practice and 
then play games without consid-
ering how much off-the-court or 

field time is put into their craft. It 
is very common to see a student-
athlete in the training room 
reading a textbook while getting 
heated or treated by a trainer. 
Multitasking is what they do, and 
for Leindecker it’s just another 
part of her day.
“I’m really independent,” she 
said. 
Her goal for the remainder of 
her time at UAlbany includes 
staying on top of her schoolwork 
and putting herself in a good 
position to pursue graduate school 
for occupational therapy. She also 
couldn’t be happier about who 
she has as her teammates. This 
season, Leindecker said, is the 
closest the team has been. 
Tatum Jungsten is the lone 
senior on the volleyball team and 
co-captain. Jungsten described 
Leindecker as “ambitious and 
dedicated.”
“When [Head Coach MJ 
Engstrom] saw her, she was goofy 
footed, she was right handed, but 
she took a left handed approach,” 
Jungsten said. “Which is bad. 
So MJ told her that she wasn’t 

going to offer her a scholarship 
unless she changed her footwork. 
Changing your footwork entirely 
is something that you wouldn’t 
think she would do. But she 
walked around her house in high 
school working on her footwork.” 
Leindecker was offered a 
scholarship to come to UAlbany 
under Engstrom because she 
was willing to do the seemingly 
impossible.
 “I think that shows how 
ambitious and dedicated Laini is,” 
Jungston said. 
“I was never the best. It 
was always a maybe for me,” 
Leindecker said.
Maybe she’ll make it to a 
Division I program, maybe she’ll 
be one of the best outside hitters 
to play for UAlbany and maybe 
she’ll become an occupational 
therapist. But all of these maybes 
have given Laini that bite and 
preparation for any challenge 
thrown her way.

weren’t enough for a 
goal. Then Binghamton 
had a few shots, all saved 
by Brennan. Both teams 
tried initiating play in the 
midfield, but neither got a 
strong offensive chance.
In minute 43, a free 
kick by Fitzpatrick was 
deflected by the keeper to 
Schneider for a rebound 
kick right into the net, 
making the score 1-0 go-
ing into halftime. 
“We weren’t playing 
that well and they had a 
lot of opportunities. I think 
it’s good when you’re not 
getting a lot of opportuni-
ties, but then the momen-
tum automatically switches once 
you get that first goal, so I think 
that was huge before halftime,” 
Schneider said.
Binghamton took advantage of 
the wind in the second half but Al-
bany got the first chance at a goal. 
Rugar aimed for the goal 25 yards 
out, but goal-keeper Katie Hatziya-
nis caught the ball.

In minute 68, Binghamton’s Aly 
Falinski scored her first goal of the 
season. A free kick by Katherine 
Corcoran was blocked by Brennan, 
which led to a corner kick by Falin-
ski that was deflected by UAlbany, 
giving Falinski a second shot. The 
ball went into the left post, tying the 
game at 1-1.
Fitzpatrick got a free kick five 
minutes later. It deflected off of 

Schneider to Vivian 
Vega, who shot the 
ball into the right 
post, putting UAlbany 
in the lead 2-1.
There were a few 
more attempts by 
Binghamton but none 
held, leading to the 
Great Danes’ victory.
Cucchiella thinks 
Binghamton is a 
good team and they 
were definitely 
challenging at times 
so she’s happy to get 
the result. “I think 
Binghamton at times 
put us under some 
good pressure,” she 
said. 
Schneider couldn’t 
agree more. “They 
pressured us a lot. It 
was hard to get on the ball for three 
or four touches which made us get 
out of our game for a little bit,” she 
said. Once they adjusted they were 
able to play. “But props for them 
for being able to get us out of our 
game,” said Schneider.
UAlbany will be on the road 
for the next two games. Their next 
home game will be Thursday, Oct. 
15 at Bob Ford Field.

WNBA

won three titles in a 
row. 
After graduating, 
Holdsclaw was the 
first overall pick by the 
Washington Mystics 
in the 1999 WNBA 
Draft. During her 
long WNBA career, 
Holdsclaw earned 
many records and was 
a six-time WNBA All-
Star. 
“That was my dream 
when I was a kid,” 
Holdsclaw said of her 
top selection in the 
draft. 
At one point, 
Holdsclaw was called 
the female Michael 
Jordan because of her 
star power and athletic 
prowess. 
But her time in the 
WNBA is when her 
life took a turn for the 
worst. When playing 
with the Los Ange-
les Sparks in 2006, 
Holdsclaw tried to 
take her own life. She 
was diagnosed with 
bipolar disorder and 
depression, and needed 
to step away from the 
game. 
“Having to walk 
away from the game 
when I had those 
struggles with mental 
health,” Holdsclaw said 
of the low point of her 
career, “to know that 
something that brought 
me so much joy over 
the years, it was killing 
me that I had to step 
away to take care of 
me.”  
The sequence of 
events in her life were 
chronicled in the 
documentary that was 
shown in the Campus 
Center ballroom to 
about 200 students, 
faculty, and commu-
nity members. 
After speaking at 
UAlbany last year, 
Counseling and Psy-
chological Services 
were happy to bring 
Holdsclaw back again. 
“She is so authentic 
in the way she speaks, 
and the way students 
react to her is great,” 
Heidi Wright, a staff 
psychologist, said. 
“[The film] showed 
her story in a differ-
ent way. We got to see 
different people in her 
life.” 
Before the 
documentary was 
screened, Holdsclaw 
briefly talked about 
her life and the journey 
she took to becoming 

a mental health 
advocate. After the 
screening, Holdsclaw 
took questions from 
the crowd, and many 
students were eager 
to hear from the 
former Olympic Gold 
Medalist. 
“I just love young 
minds and how they 
break it down. This 
is mental health and 
we’re trying to spread 
the conversation,” 
Holdsclaw said. “These 
kids hit it from all dif-
ferent angles and I love 
that.” 
Holdsclaw has been 
spreading her message 
of mental health since 
she retired from the 
WNBA in 2010.
“It’s about a journey. 
Being with college 
students is amazing be-
cause these are the peo-
ple of the future that 
are going to continue 
to change the conversa-
tion,” Holdsclaw said. 
“I use my platform to 
get it out there. I’m 
going to make people 
real uncomfortable to 
help bring some atten-
tion to this and help 
de-stigmatize it.” 
Toward the end 
of the event, one 
student stepped up to 
the microphone and 
talked about her own 
struggle with bipolar 
disorder before asking 
Holdsclaw a question.  
“It’s really powerful. 
You’re in school, 
you’re shy and you 
don’t want to talk in 
front of people but she 
recognized that this is 
who she is. The fact 
that she recognized it 
is admirable because it 
shows she’s working to 
be better,” Holdsclaw 
said. “People are 
empowered. They’re 
saying it, claiming it 
because they want to 
get better.”

study here and play soccer at a high 
level,” Pinheiro said of his decision to 
come to UAlbany. “Bernardo [Mat-
tos] started everything. I’ve known 
him since I was 9 years old and it all 
worked out.” 
“The soccer world is a very small 
world,” Gorman said. “It’s amazing 
who you know and how players all 
know each other and they like the 
idea of playing together.” 
Gorman knows what to expect after 
having seen many players make the 
transition themselves, but that doesn’t 
make it any easier for the players. 
“It’s not easy for anybody, no 
matter how good you are or how 
talented you might be. It’s a difficult 
transition,” Gorman said. “You’re 
in a completely new environment, a 
completely different country, a new 
language. You have to get used to 
those things.” 
The transition to American life was 
a tough one for the players, on and off 
the field. Like many other students, 
the Brazilian duo were surprised as 
the calendar turned into winter. 
“I thought my English was better 
than it actually was. When I got here, 
I saw that it’s hard to communicate,” 
Melgar said. “The cold weather, for 
me, is the worst. In Brazil, it’s never 
cold like that. My first winter was 
horrible for me. I missed home every 
day.” 
“For me, it was funny at the begin-
ning. We’d go to classes and have 
no idea what’s going on. You think 
you had good English,” Pinheiro 
said. “The first month was the most 
difficult but you get used to it. Then 
the winter comes and, oh my God, 

I’ve never 
experienced 
anything like 
that before.” 
Despite the 
cold weather, 
Pinheiro fin-
ished his year 
on a hot streak 
by winning the 
America East 
Rookie of the 
Year Award by 
scoring seven 
goals in his 
first season. 
Now, he al-
ready has eight 
with at least 
nine games to 
play. 
Even though 
the individual 
numbers were 
good, the team 
failed to reach 
its goal as they 
fell to Vermont 
2-1 in the 
America East 
Quarterfinals 
last November. 
Now, the team 
is focused as 
they try to 
write a better 
finish to their script this year. 
“This year, we set a goal to stay 
first or second in the America East,” 
Pinheiro said. “I want to host the final 
here in our stadium so we can have 
our fins in a good environment. We 
all know we can do that. That’s our 

goal.” 
“The goal is to get better every day 
and every game,” Gorman said. “Ulti-
mately, the only game that matters is 
the next one you play.” 
For UAlbany, that next game will 
be on Saturday, Oct. 10 at UMBC in 
an America East conference match.
