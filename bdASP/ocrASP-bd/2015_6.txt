The new school year means 
a new round of outreach and 
protests from contingent facul-
ty fighting for better treatment 
from the administration. The 
Albany chapter of the Union of 
University Professions (UUP) 
is treating contingent issues 
as a high priority this school 
year, citing higher pay and a 
path to tenure as its goals, and 
contingents are serving on the 
front lines. 
“I’m tired of complaining. I 
want to make things change,” 
says Holly Mckenna, a contin-
gent professor, although she 
rejects that title.
“I don’t even let my students 
call me professor because I 
don’t feel like one,” she said. 
“It’s a constant fight in a well-
paid profession, and I’m at the 
bottom.”
Mckenna teaches two 
classes, serves on the faculty 
senate, and makes so little that 
she qualifies for food stamps. 
She relies on her husband and 
her side job as a babysitter for 
additional income. Her experi-
ence as a contingent professor 
inspired her activity in the 
UUP in its ongoing campaign 
to raise working standards for 
contingent faculty. 
Around half of UAlbany’s 
faculty is contingent and the 
starting pay per class is around 
$3,000. Contingents do not 
have tenure, and often lack 
long term contracts with the 
university. Contingent pay 
has mostly remained the same 
for the past decade, while the 
amount of contingent staff to 
tenured, contract professors 
has risen. 
“The administration likes 
to say it’s hurting for money, 
but look at the new Campus 
Center,” McKenna said. “If 
you can’t pay your mortgage, 
you shouldn’t renovate your 
kitchen.” 
“I get that you have to save 
money, but they’re going about 
it the wrong way.”
Rebekah Tolley is another 
contingent professor and an 
officer for the UUP with a 
focus on contingents. She’s 
been teaching for 10 years and 
currently gives art courses at 
UAlbany and in Oneonta. She 
receives no additional payment

Journalism can sometimes be a traumatic 
job. Five journalists, including Richard Drew, 
the photographer of “The Falling Man,” echoed 
this throughout Saturday during a workshop 
about covering trauma in journalism. 
There is “a lot of trauma in the newsroom 
today,” David Handschuh, with the New York 
Daily News at the time, said. Handschuh was 
on his way to teach his first day of class at 
NYU when he heard his police radio screaming 
“planes just hit the World Trade Center.” He 
called the school asking them to leave a note on 
the door saying the professor would be late.  
“I didn’t realize I’d be nine months late,” 
Handschuh said.  When he ventured out to 
photograph 9/11, he realized very quickly that 
he was in a dangerous situation, but he knew 

it was his job to, as he said, “document the 
truth no matter what the consequences.”  For 
Handschuh, the consequences were a shattered 
leg, bruises, and burns that kept him in the 
hospital for nine months.  He was crushed 
under the rubble of the first tower as it fell, but 
he still made sure to get the shot.
Drew spoke next. “It is our job to record 
history every day,” he said. Drew was 
photographing Fashion Week when he heard 
the news that a plane hit the first tower, so he 
headed to the World Trade Center. He began 
photographing the towers, and then the people 
as they fell. 
“It may be distasteful, but it’s my job,” he 
said. When asked how he feels about what he 
did that day and the pictures he made, he said 
that it’s not about doing the right thing, it’s 
about doing the thing. The thing is showing 

the truth of what happened, even when it’s 
traumatic.  
Both photographers admitted that the field of 
journalism can be dangerous and safety can be 
compromised.
“Trying not to get shot, but trying to get 
the shot” is often the case, Handschuh said. 
“Committing journalism may be dangerous to 
your mental health.” 
The workshop, which was organized by the 
New York State Associated Press Association, 
took place at The College of Saint Rose, and 
after a break for lunch, Danny Spriggs, a 
former Secret Service agent and the current 
vice president for global security at AP, spoke 
about precautions journalists can take to protect 
themselves from trauma when it happens.  
As a former agent, Spriggs went through

When fellow employees at 
the University at Albany spoke 
to Dexter White, he would avert 
his eyes in shyness. He kept to 
himself at work and outside of 
work. He polished floors, set up 
for events, and broke-down the 

setups once they were finished. He 
did this every night when he came 
in to work: the third shift from 
10 p.m. to 6:30 a.m. when the 
campus is still and lifeless. He did 
his work quietly and never once 
complained. And, on Friday Sept. 
20, he passed away quietly in the 
tunnels where he has worked for 

more than 15 years from a heart 
attack. He laid there on the subter-
ranean concrete floors outside of 
the Campus Center until he was 
found by four students passing by 
at 4:27 a.m.
White was more than just a 
quiet man. To his coworkers, he 
was the tall and stylish man who 

was dedicated to his work. He 
stood just above 6 feet and had 
a muscular build. He had a dark 
complexion and a long black 
ponytail that usually hung from 
the backside of a Kangol flat cap. 
He didn’t wear the shoes a cleaner 
would wear. Instead, he wore 
shiny black dress shoes. He wore 

a leather jacket too, and carried 
a leather briefcase to work every 
day except for Fridays.
Lena Thornton, a third shift 
cleaner who worked with White, 
remembers that the briefcase was 
filled with magazines he was read-
ing at the time. It was also stashed

DANES SAY WHAT?

“It’s great to vote. Not voting 
silences you and makes you 
have to follow our government 
blindly. Not voting removes 
your power to make a difference 
inyour community and in your 
country. There are many nations 
in the world that don’t allow 
their people to be heard. So to 
not take advantage of voting 
rights is not only ignorant but a 
disrespect to the millions who 
would do anything to have such a 
privelage.”
-  Juliet Shinney, Class of 2017

This week, we asked students: 

Do you think it is important for college 
students to vote and why?

Compiled by Vaughnee 
Simmons

“It is absolutely important to vote. 
Everyday people complain about 
how corrupt politics is. When we 
vote, we have the power to choose 
who we want in office and who 
will run the country. Right now, 
our country needs a lot of change 
so I hope all people use their right 
to vote for the good of the United 
States.”

The difference between 
the brain and the mind

training to prepare for protecting 
the president, and he was there 
when Ronald Reagan was shot. He 
learned how to protect himself and 
others, and now he sends journal-
ists to training camps to learn 
self-defense and how to protect 
themselves in traumatic situations.  
He also standardized protective 
gear for AP journalists to wear 
in dangerous situations. Spriggs 
adopted a quote, which he now 
uses as his mantra, “proper plan-
ning and practice prevents poor 
performance.”  He wants all of his 
journalists to have all the practice 

and planning they need to do this 
high-risk job safely.
The last event of the day was a 
panel of speakers who have cov-
ered traumatic assignments in their 
careers as journalists.
Julie McMahon, a crime 
reporter for the Syracuse Post-
Standard and Syracuse.com, won 
a New York AP award for best 
feature in 2014 for her story about 
a woman who had lost her face in 
a traumatic accident. On covering 
such a traumatic story, McMahon 
said it didn’t hit her right away, 
but if it doesn’t hit you right away, 
it will catch up with you. She said 
it’s important to have a buddy 
for traumatic stories so you have 
someone to talk to about what you 
just saw.

Eric Hoppel, news director for 
NewsChannel 13 in Albany, said 
covering trauma is hard because 
you have to call people who 
have just experienced a difficult 
situation and you often get one 
of three types of people. The first 
will hang up on you and be angry 
that you called, the second won’t 
know what to say because they 
still haven’t processed it yet, and 
the third will say thank you and 
be happy you called because they 
want their story told.  
“It is for those people that you 
call all these [other] people,” Hop-
pel said.
Reporting on traumatic topics 
isn’t easy at first. “I never thought 
at the beginning I’d be able to deal 
with some of this stuff,” Chris 

Brunner, former news director of 
NewsChannel 9, Albany, said. 
Both Brunner and McMahon can 
only recall one time when the job 
got a little too traumatic and they 
each had to turn away. McMa-
hon once saw the aftermath of a 
suicide, and Brunner when he cov-
ered Ralph Tortorici when he held 
LC5 in the University at Albany 
at gunpoint in 1994, and Tortorici 
wanted to speak to him.  
Knowing when to step away, 
according to the panel, is as impor-
tant as knowing when to jump in.  
Both recall experiences messing 
them up in the head for a while, 
but taking time to recover got them 
through it.
“We really have to look out for 
one another, we are our own best 

support system, and we have to 
help each other,” Hoppel said.

Science writer Casey 
Schwartz gave a seminar 
to over 40 people on 
Oct. 6 in the D’Ambra 
Auditorium at the Life 
Sciences building. What 
separates the young writer 
from previous visitors is the 
subject matter of her first 
book, “In the Mind Fields: 
Exploring the New Science 
of Neuropsychoanalysis.” 
Looking through the 
lenses of neuropsychologist 
pioneers, Schwartz 
accomplishes what Writers 
Institute Program Fellow 
Mark Koplik called “the 
first venture of its kind, and 
an adventure into unknown 
territory between the brain 
and the mind.”
Schwartz never saw it 
coming, though. “If I had 
said to myself at 20 my 
first book would be about 
neuroscience, I never 
would’ve believed that,” 
she told the crowd. “This 
is a topic I stumbled into 
completely on accident.”
There’s no accident in 
Schwartz being a journalist. 
Her father Jonathan 
Schwartz has been a radio 
personality in the New 
York City market since 
the 1960s, and her mother 
Marie Brenner is a writer-
at-large for Vanity Fair. 
The accidental part is the 
scientific part.
Schwartz was always 
interested in psychology 
and showed it when she 
enrolled in a University 
College London graduate 
program that gave her 
access to the Anna Freud 
Centre. It was there that 
the antiquity of Freudian-
thought dawned on her, and 
in the following year she 
flipped her research over to 
the study of neuroscience at 
Yale University.
“It was that combination 

of seeing those two 
disciplines side by side 
that I first began to think, 
‘okay there might be a story 
here,’” she said. “‘There 
might be a book.’”
It was only when 
Schwartz met Mark Solms 
that the book finally had its 
bearings. Solms, a South 
African neuropsychologist 
with a huge personality, 
would become the major 
character. Schwartz 
would be the observer 
and occasional participant 
herself.
“I did want to be there,” 
she said about this literary 
device. “I was dealing with 
such scientific material, 
but I wanted the reader 
to engage with it through 
me… I could hold their 
hand and give it a personal 
experience.”
The response to her 
book so far has been 
overwhelmingly positive 
in several communities. 
Joshua Kendall of the Los 
Angeles Times writes, 
“Schwartz explains in her 
thoughtful investigation… 
a small coterie of mental 
health professionals, led by 
South African psychologist 
Mark Solms, have made a 
compelling case that Freud 
should not be relegated to a 
footnote.”
Scott Stossel, editor of 
The Atlantic (a magazine 
Schwartz has contributed 
to), said, “‘In The Mind 
Fields’ is a brilliant and 
enthralling exploration 
of a scientific and 
philosophical conundrum 
that has preoccupied 
thinkers from Descartes to 
Freud to Oliver Sacks: the 
relationship between brain 
and mind.”
Schwartz said that apart 
from her peers’ adoration, 
psychoanalysts have 
reached out as well. She 
hasn’t found the same, 

warm welcome from the 
neuroscience community 
as of yet, although to date 
she can only recall one 
scene where they directly 
engaged her. It was at 
a Columbia University 
workshop composed of “90 
percent young, brilliant 
post-doc neuroscientists, 
and 10 percent random 
writers and journalists who 
sort of drift in and out,” as 
she described it.
“I workshopped the 
first chapter of [my] book, 
which is highly Freudian, 
although it brought in some 
neuroscience,” she said. 
“They shredded it to pieces. 
They were so offended. 
They asked, ‘why are you 
writing about Freud? Who 
could possibly still care 
about Freud?’ I think it was 
because I was daring to 
engage neuroscience in that 
context.”
Apart from her current 
national book tour, 
Schwartz has written for 
Newsweek, The Daily 
Beast, and is a current 
contributor for The New 
York Times Magazine. As 
far as being stuck with the 
label “science journalist,” 
she’s unsure of her next 
move.
“I don’t envision a 
career writing books about 
science, and I don’t know 
if I ever will write about 
science again at book 
length, because it’s so 
dependent on the people 
involved,” she said. “For 
me it’s more about the 
characters than the fields or 
ideas.”
Aside from her seminar 
at UAlbany, Schwartz also 
gave a reading from her 
book, which came out Aug. 
25, at Huxley Auditorium 
in the New York State 
Museum at 8 p.m. For 
more information, visit the

e have arrived at the halfway 
point of the semester: midterm 
point. 
All of the students at the 
University at Albany are dusting off their 

textbooks and penciling in review days to 
get themselves prepared for the upcoming 
exam hell.
Now I am not going to say that midterms 
are a joke and that we don’t need them. 
Quite frankly, we need midterms. At this 
point students realize how well they’re 

doing in their courses. Midterms are a mi-
crocosm for final exams and final papers.
I like to know how well I did on a 
midterm because it lays out for me where I 
stand in class, and in turn how much effort 
I need to put in for the rest of the semester. 
Midterms give me a direction to go when, 
up until then, I have generally no idea 
where I’ll end up. 
“It is important to keep midterm grades 
in perspective. They provide valuable in-
formation to students at an important point 
in the semester. Students who make sure to 
check these grades, and who consider what 
they mean, know whether they are advanc-
ing smoothly or whether they may need to 
make some changes,” Vicki Nelson says on 
her website, collegeparentcentral.com.
Midterms are a necessary facet of any 
college course and I greatly appreciate 
what a midterm does for me in theory. 
What I will say is that, while midterms are 
important to have, they are most certainly 
not fun.
Who enjoys sitting for an exam that’s 
worth about a quarter of their grade, shak-
ing with nervousness thinking about the 
great pressure to do well?
At the same time, there is usually more 
than one. I have four midterm exams and 
essays this week alone. This multiplies the 
pressure immensely.
“It’s so stressful, there’s so many things 
you have to do. [Exams] all happen at the 
same time.” Fiona Wang, a senior at UAl-
bany, says. “No one likes midterms.”
Midterms are a bit of a drag. They are 
exhausting, sometimes hard to manage 
and just plain awful. And at the same time, 
if students think like I do, then they are 
already worried about finals, because finals 

are midterms times two. 
Essentially midterms are the experiment 
of the semester, showcasing how well one 
will do on the final. And once they are 
over, there will be some reprieve knowing 
that half the semester has gone by and we 
are still alive after it. 
But, midterms are a key part of the se-
mester for the same reason: half the semes-
ter has gone by and that only means that 
the workload for a class will only increase 
as we near home stretch––finals.
Yes, they suck, and yes, no one wants to 
take them, but it’s not like they are going 
anywhere any time soon. The best thing 
that any student can do is suck it up, study 
hard, and make it through the exam. I can’t 
imagine that the exams or papers are that 
hard, at least if students properly prepare 
for either. 
We shall take this opportunity to learn 
and understand what the professor expects 
out of us and just how the next exam or 
paper will work. It might actually help in 
the future.
In a nutshell, this exam, although is not 
pleasant to think about, will act as a forma-
tion of the rest of the semester. Take this 
time to fully craft how the rest of the se-
mester will go because this paper or exam 
is going to extend beyond the parameters of 
the week and will reflect on the final grade 
for the overall course.
But, I do and always will sympathize 
with all of the students at UAlbany and on 
other campuses around the world who will 
be taking an exam or several exams this 
week or in the weeks to come. Push on and 
stay strong, it’ll be over soon.

Winter is coming. 
While University at Albany students 
don’t have to worry about the imminent 
threat of White Walkers, get ready for 
three to five months of chilly temperatures, 
unpredictable snowfall, nasty road 
conditions and using the underground 
tunnels as much as possible. The upcoming 
winter is dependent on what Mother Nature 
decides to throw at us.
Last year was cold. It was a very 
chilly winter for this region and, as many 
weather outlets noted, February was the 
second-coldest February on record for 
the area. Last winter was noted to have 
frigid temperatures as low as the teens and 
negatives and unpredictable snowstorms, 
especially in the second half. Many 
climate analysts have already predicted 
that this wintertime will have fewer frosty 
conditions.
According to an early weather report 
from Matthew Holliday of First Hand 
Weather, the northeast will have an overall 
milder winter. He said that warm waters 
will create a heightened jet stream that 
will push Arctic air south. The amount of 
snowfall is hard to predict but the region 
should expect much less compared to last 
year.
Science stuff aside, it sounds like we 
won’t be shivering as much this year. This 
will be noticeable in the early months as 
the later months of the season are harder 
to predict. Albany’s winters are usually 
random and unpredictable. As an Albany 
native they can go either way: harsh and 
long or mild and short. There have been 
winters with constant snow and winters 
with barely any.
On average the temperature is 25.6 
degrees Fahrenheit for the Albany area, 
according to data collected by the National 
Weather Service. Past winters, such as the 
2001-02 and 2011-12 ones, are in the top 
10 warmest winters of the area. Maybe this 
is a sign that this winter could be a nicer 
one.
Still, it’s important to prepare for 
whatever is to come. Don’t wait until it’s 
too late to get winter clothes: go out and 
get plenty of them as early as possible. 
No one wants to go winter shopping in 
February and have everything sold out 

(this has happened to me).
Remember that layers are everything 
this time of year. They are the key to 
staying warm. Make sure to have blankets, 
a heavy jacket, and other winter essentials. 
I’m talking about fuzzy socks and furry 
mittens.
Driving in the winter can also be 
treacherous and it’s important to prepare 
for this. Two words: snow tires. They make 
such a difference in driving during this 
time and it’s a good investment to keep 
people safe. This is highly recommended 
for commuters like myself out there.
Another tip for commuters especially is 
to save those precious unexcused absences 
for when they are really needed…in the 
winter. These can be lifesavers during 
tough winter times, like when a street 
doesn’t get plowed for some reason or 
classes aren’t cancelled even though there’s 
a blizzard, for example. We’ve all had 
those days trekking to class in the snow 
when we don’t want to.
And have fun during this time. It’s easy 
to become a hermit during the winter but 
one can still enjoy the snow. The UAlbany 
Ski and Snowboard Club takes regular 
trips to nearby mountain resorts to ski and 
snowboard during the season. If skiing 
and snowboarding is not an option for 
someone, then go sledding with friends one 
weekend. There are plenty of activities to 
participate in to enjoy during the winter 
while school is out. But, most importantly, 
remember to stay warm.

t was a Thursday evening 
and I was in the middle of 
watching the Steelers vs. 
Ravens game when the 
news appeared on my television: 
There had been a shooting at a 
community college in Oregon. My 
first thought was “not again.”
Chris Harper-Mercer, 26, shot 
and killed nine people and injured 
seven at Umpqua Community 
College in a matter of minutes 
before taking his own life during 
a shoot-out with police, according 
to CNN. 
In witness statements for the 
New York Post, it appeared that 
the gunman asked people if they 
were Christian and, if they were, 
shot them in the head. If they were 
not or refused to answer he shot 

them in the leg. 
In an article released by CNN, 
said that this is the 74th school 
shooting in an 18-month time 
period with an average of one 
shooting every five weeks. Seeing 
that this number is so high, I was 
shocked to learn that the school 
had just one security guard who 
was unarmed. As a student, I 
would feel much safer knowing 
that the campus I was on was 
protected by armed security. How 
many lives could have been saved 
if all schools had armed security?
The Huffington Post took a 
statement from the gunman’s 
mother who admitted that her son 
had been struggling with mental 
health issues, but did not go into 
further detail. 
This is no excuse to murder 
innocent people. This also raises 

the question - if his mother knew 
he was in possession of firearms 
and knew that he was battling 
mental health problems, why 
wasn’t more precaution taken? 
CNN reported that investigators 
found 14 firearms connected to the 
gunman, all of which were legally 
obtained by the gunman and other 
family members. It is scary to 
know that a person capable of 
shooting up a school was able to 
legally obtain guns as well. I am 
not attacking gun laws, but I am a 
gun owner myself and I remember 
the process of background checks 
before I was allowed to purchase 
one. It was pretty easy. 
That is where I think the 
problem lies. It is too easy to 
obtain guns. These days, most 
Wal-Mart stores sell guns. Like 
other gun stores, they also run 

background checks, but even 
background checks will not 
necessarily show a person’s 
history of mental health, so one 
of the most important factors of 
whether a person should own a 
gun or not is often overlooked. 
I think that all guns should 
require permits the way pistols 
do. A pistol permit requires a 
person to have four references 
and their signatures vouching that 
the person applying is capable 
of holding a pistol permit. They 
also require a person to complete 
a safety course and to provide 
fingerprints. It also asks questions 
directly about mental health. I 
know some people probably think 
that they could always lie, but then 
there are still those four references 
that one would need to vouch for 
them. 

Had the process for all guns 
been like this in the first place, I 
don’t think that we would have 
just had our 74th school shooting 
in such a short period. Parents 
send their children to school to 
be educated and to thrive in the 
world. Instead, we live in a society 
where many parents have to worry 
about whether their child’s school 
is going to be the next school 
shooting target. 
According to the New York 
Post, President Obama gave a 
statement saying, “I hope and pray 
that I don’t have to come out again 
during my tenure as president to 
offer my condolences to families 
in these circumstances… but based 
on my experience as president, 
I can’t guarantee that, and that’s 
terrible to say, and it can change.” 
Let’s just hope it does.

’ve lived near New York City for a great deal of my 
life and it is almost impossible to not hear of it’s 
“stop-and-frisk” program or the appalling stories of 
racial profiling and harassment that have resulted 
from it. 
The “stop-and-frisk” program has been in action for 
more than a decade, with well over a quarter of a million 
stops a year. Claiming to help maintain a better and safer 
city, it still creates a good deal of controversy - and it isn’t 
hard to see why.
Imagine walking home from school or work and being 
stopped by a police officer for looking suspicious because 
you’re wearing a hoodie. The question is: what is the 
point of this program? Nine out of 10 stops result in the 
discovery of no illegal activity, so it isn’t bringing the 
crime rate down either. Those selected for this random 
search-and-seizure are usually either African-American 
or Latino.
Since 2002, the imbalance of individuals selected 
for the program has never been more obvious. Just 
last year there were almost 14,000 “stop-and-frisks” 
conducted. More than 80 percent of those stops found no 
weapons or illegal materials. What is more startling is 
that more than 50 percent of the individuals chosen were 
African-Americans. In fact, more than 50 percent of the 
individuals chosen in the past 10 years were African-
American. 
Luckily, I have not been selected for a search while 
in the city, but I have been profiled before, as age also 
plays a major factor in the “stop-and-frisk” program. 

Our fourth amendment right has always been a source of 
controversy. 
Originally proposed by Thomas Jefferson in 1792, 
our search-and-seizure right has gone through revision 
after revision. This topic has been controversial, to say 
the least. The main questions being: “what constitutes 
as suspicious” and “when the person is seized, what 
constitutes as a search?” The fourth amendment, a part 
of the bill of rights, prohibits unreasonable searches and 
seizures without a warrant. 
Turning on the news, one is more than likely to hear 
about tragic stories the have resulted from the “stop-and-
frisk” program than positive stories. 
The idea of a police officer stopping me simply 
because I look a certain way or am acting a way that 
they deem suspicious, resulting in a search, seems like a 
violation of my rights. 
The process gives the officer the authoritative right to 
stop anyone they think may be involved in some illegal 
activity. Once the subject is seized, a proper search has 
commenced. After finding no signs of illegal activity, the 
officer must fill out either a paper report or an electronic 
form that explains the reason for the stop as well as a 
description of the behavior of the occupant. A receipt 
is given to the subject and released. There are several 
options on the paper report such as “Engaging in a Drug 
Transaction” or “Casing Victim or Location.”
When New York City had announced its “stop-and-
frisk” program there was a plethora of social and political 
outcry. It’s easy to argue that this was racial profiling 
with legal means. Segregation has always been both a 
massive and unfortunate element in our nation’s history. 

With incidents against African-American citizens that 
occur even to this very day, the opposition was more than 
warranted. 
My basic constitutional rights are very important to me. 
The idea that I am protected to write about my opinion in 
this very article is inspiring. It is important to remember 
the rights that each and every person is entitled to and it 
is equally important to never be encouraged to resort to 
physical violence when it feels like a person’s or one’s 
own rights have been violated, like in so many tragic 
cases that have occurred over the years. 
With the “stop-and-frisk” program constantly being 
brought before the judicial system to be dismantled, I 
think I speak for a lot of people by saying I can only hope 
that there is, at the very least, some sort of mutual ground 
that respects the rights of everyone.

TWO POPULAR ALBANY 
MUSIC VENUES CLOSE 

LOCAL MUSIC 

Bogies and The Armory close, music will continue 

Source: relentlessaware.com
The Washington Avenue Armory hasn’t hosted a concert since stabbings occurred during a Migos performance last Spring. 

By BRIAN LAZARO 

Throughout the past several years, the 
city of Albany has attracted a diverse range 
of well-known musical artists. From world-
class DJs to iconic rappers and a variety of 
bands, the musical richness of the city has 
kept college students around the area wait-
ing for the next big act. However, through-
out this past year, the Washington Avenue 
Armory and Bogie’s, two of Albany’s big-
gest music venues, have closed down. 
The Armory was popular amongst col-
lege students as being one of the best and 
most convenient venues in the city. It had a 
large capacity, an impressive sound system, 
creative stage set-ups, and was located right 
off Washington Ave, making it an easy trip 
for University at Albany students. It was 
able to hold approximately 4,000 people, 
attracting big name acts to perform there. 
Although not as big as the Times Union 
Center, it did host concerts that were more 
affordable, thus bringing forth many college 
kids. The venue hosted a large slew of acts 
such as Skrillex, Deadmau5, Nas, Rick 
Ross, Korn, Slayer, and many more.
This past spring semester the Armory 
stopped operating as a music venue. During 

the past few years there have been cases 
of domestic violence which have led to 
numerous problems for the venue. “There 
were too many instances, probably about 
10 incidents…many that people weren’t 
even aware of,” recalls ex-promoter of the 
Armory Ted Etoll. 
Some of these instances, like the Barstool 
riot back in Fall 2012 and the stabbings at 
the Migos concert earlier this year, have 
caused outrage throughout the city. People 
within the local neighborhood and police 
authorities complained about the violent 
outbursts that occurred throughout the 
concerts. 
Etoll states that the combination of poor 
management and ineffective security led to 
these incidents. “It was run as poorly as any 
concert venue in the history of the country,” 
said Etoll. “But most importantly it was the 
worst security ever known in the business.”
Aside from the persistent complaints, 
the venue even lost its liquor license as a 
result of the incidents. With all these issues, 
it remains unclear if the Armory will ever 
re-open. 
“The local neighborhood was angry 
along with the police… I think all of that 
plus losing the liquor license, I don’t know 

if they will come back,” explains Etoll.
Furthermore, Bogies, an underground 
music venue located right in Ontario Street 
was also shut down this year. Bogies was 
well-known as a hard-rock/metal themed 
venue as it contained dark lighting and a 
long, narrow floor space that allowed music 
to echo effortlessly throughout the structure. 
Bogies was inferior to the Armory in terms 
of size and attracted smaller crowds, but its 
goal was not to bring the most people, but 
rather to maintain itself as a hub for music 
lovers. Bogies hosted a variety of bands 
throughout its tenure such as Blink 182, 
Green Day, The Acacia Strain, Exodus, and 
many more.
“Bogies was on an upswing and had 
potential to do bigger things,” said Mike 
Valente of Upstate Black n Blue Promo-
tions.
Bogies was definitely one of the most 
unique venues in Albany as it differentiated 
itself from the mainstream. However after 
experiencing tax issues, the venue would ul-
timately shut down. According to Valente, 
“It had nothing to do with the venue or my 
production company. Bogies shut down 
because the owner of the building owed 
$80,000 in back taxes.” 

With the Armory and Bogies no longer 
remaining, other venues such as Upstate 
Concert Hall and the Times Union Center 
have stepped up. Upstate Concert Hall, 
located in Clifton Park, recently released 
plenty of new shows. Throughout the next 
few months they will be hosting a variety of 
bands such as New Found Glory, The Devil 
Wears Prada, Emarosa, and more. DJs to 
perform there include Griz, Borgore, Party 
Favor and Tommy Trash.
The Times Union Center has a few inter-
esting shows during the semester as well. 
This fall they will be hosting Darius Rucker 
and Dead & Company, a collaboration be-
tween John Mayer and The Grateful Dead.
Valente’s Black n Blue Promotions 
will be booking shows at Trickshots, The 
Fuzebox and The Loft and The Chance in 
Poughkeepsie.
The recent shutdown of venues like the 
Armory and Bogies will be missed. Nothing 
could ever replace the rich culture of Bo-
gies and the grandiose of the Armory. Both 
venues played a major role in maintaining 
Albany’s music culture. But perhaps this 
will initiate a new era of musical upbring-
ings within the city. As always, the music 
lives on.

After a summer-long hiatus, Saturday 
Night Live has returned with an overall 
mediocre premiere episode. 
Miley Cyrus returned to host the show 
for her third time. While she did fine as a 
musical guest she didn’t have the comedic 
chops to make SNL’s 41 season opener 
memorable. Previous hosts such as Tina Fey 
and Alec Baldwin have done a better job at 
bringing the laughs to season openings.
Cyrus played to her strengths in her 
opening monologue by singing. The melody 
teased all the people who escaped SNL’s 
skewering radar this summer, including the 
likes of Kim Davis, Rachel Dolezal, and 
Walter Palmer. Her self-referential jokes 
have been recycled from previous events (we 
get it Miley, you smoke a lot of weed).
After a summer of Donald Trump candi-

dacy headlines, the opening unsurprisingly 
featured Taran Killam as the aforementioned 
Republican and Cecily Strong as his wife 
Melania. “Welcome to our humble gold 
house,” Strong quips in a foreign accent as 
Melania.
The opening was funny, but not as 
strong as it could have been. It made fun of 
Trump’s political views on immigration and 
his relation with the media. “He knows that 
if he says the craziest things, he will go up in 
poll numbers,” Strong said.
Since Strong’s departure, Weekend Up-
date has been struggling. Fortunately, Colin 
Jost and Michael Che show promise in the 
new season in the way they interact with one 
another. The segment featured Jost embrac-
ing his white and wispy demeanor much to 
the chagrin of Che, who at one point after 
Jost made a blackface joke said, “I begged 
you not to go with that one, man.”

This bit worked on more than once 
occasion during the segment and showed a 
much-needed dynamic into the relationship 
between these two co-hosts. Additionally, 
Pete Davidson and Leslie Jones appeared as 
correspondents on the show doing their usual 
stand-up bits. Kyle Mooney also appeared as 
his ongoing Pope Francis impression, but his 
jokes were not on target even after a recent 
stateside visit from pope himself.
Cyrus sang songs from her recently 
released free online album “Miley Cyrus & 
Her Dead Petz.” Miley wore her usual kooky 
outfits while she sang her surreal ballads 
“Karen Don’t Be Sad” and “Twinkle Song.” 
They were, like Miley’s persona, strange and 
outlandish, but that’s expected of her at this 
point.
The sketches were misfires. The passable 
ones were “The Millennials” sketch and the 
“Abilify For People Who Think They Can 

Be President” commercial, while the major-
ity of the other sketches were unimpressive.
The highlight of the show came from a 
presidential-centric sketch, which featured 
Kate McKinnon as Hillary Clinton, and 
Clinton herself as the bartender Val. In the 
sketch, Clinton goes for it completely, even 
at one point doing her own Trump impres-
sion and never breaking character.
“I could’ve supported it sooner,” said 
McKinnon as Clinton about gay marriage. 
“Good point,” replied Clinton.
In general this episode was a mixed bag 
and does not bode well for future episodes, 
as many critics have noticed the quality of 
SNL has been declining in past seasons. 
Hopefully upcoming episodes will benefit 
from the featuring of prominent comedians 
Amy Schumer and Tracy Morgan as hosts. 
Saturday Night Live airs every Saturday at 
11:30 p.m. on NBC.

The album is the first without founding member Peter Hook.

New Order, a band birthed in 
the ashes of the iconic post-punk 
experiment Joy Division, released 
their 10th studio album on Sept. 
25. “Music Complete” marks the 
first release since the departure 
of founding Joy Division and 
New Order member, bassist Peter 
Hook, whose signature melodic 
bass-lines helped define the sound 
the U.K. musicians worked to 
master throughout the bands 35 
year tenure. Even with missing 
elements, keyboardist Gillian 
Gilbert returned to the band after 
a 10 year hiatus to record and tour 
with the group.
“We needed [to record a new] 
album to keep New Order a 
vibrant, vital band,” guitarist, 
singer, and frontman Bernard 
Sumner said during an interview 
with Idolator.com “This quote 
will probably come back and 
haunt me in a few years, but if 
you don’t continue writing new 
material, you become simply a 
performer and stop being a musi-
cian…”
“Music Complete” clocked 
in at Number Two on the U.K. 
Album Charts during its first 
week, which could be a fantastic 
sign that the group has overcome 
the heat of continuing as a band, 
even without founding member 
Peter Hook. Co-founding member 
Sumner spoke with TheGuardian.
com about his estranged relation-
ship with his former bandmate. 
“He [Hook] was angry- he’s 
an angry man- and the anger was 
inside the band. And a lot of the 
anger was focused on me and that 
isn’t very nice to have to deal with 
on a day-to-day basis…he said it 
himself, he’d got to an age where 
he felt he couldn’t compromise. 
He wanted things done his way or 
not at all…”admitted Sumner.
Even without the signature 
bass-work of Hook, “Music 
Complete” successfully fuses 
the classic sound that helped 
to define them as a synth-pop, 
alternative powerhouse along with 
modern-sounding electro-work. 
The first track on the album, 
which coincidently the first single 
released, “Restless” utilizes cease-
less basslines, strumming acoustic 
guitar and synth engineering 
that wreak of ‘80s-era Gillian 
Gilbert-beauty with cheeky lyrics 
delivered by Sumner; “I feel so 
restless/A’int got no interest/I 
could care less/Can’t be a suc-
cess.”  
New Order teamed up with 
multiple music-industry hotshots 
to support the completion of 
this record, including La Roux 
singer Elly Jackson for the dance 
mega-track “Tutti Fruiti” which 
is reminiscent of mid-80s New 
Order fame. The Killers frontman 
Brandon Flowers is featured in 
the closing track of the record, 
titled “Superheated” and provides 

an upbeat sendoff for the album, 
delivering harmonies with Sumner 
during the chorus, complete with a 
fantastic vocal solo near the close 
of the track. 
“Well, with every record you 
make, you just do the best you 
can. Somewhere in your head 
there’s always this thing- and 
it’s pointless denying it- that you 
really want it to be massive. But, 
at the end of the day, there are so 
many other forces involved mak-
ing it a success of making it tank,” 
Morris said during an Oct. 6, 2015 
interview with TheQuietus.com.
Garage-rock Godfather Iggy 
Pop dictates eerie-poetry in “Stray 
Dog” proclaiming; “They say the 
secret of our happiness is uncon-
ditional love/Brotherhood and 
trying to be good and trying not 
to drink/But I can’t stop drink-
ing, it’s in my blood.” Chemical 
Brothers mogul Tom Rowlands 
provides production on two 
tracks, which really showcase his 
dancefloor lust; see “Unlearn This 
Hatred” for reference, which takes 
elements of modern dance music 
and collides it with the classic 
New Order hooks.
“Singularity” is also produced 
with Rowlands, and keeps the 
essence of classic New Order, 
joining ceaseless, thumping 
basslines of New Order rookie, 
Tom Chapman, with the strange 
atmospheric synth arrangements 
by Gillian Gilbert. The track also 
explores the beauty of [Stephen] 
Morris’s signature drum machine-
emulating percussion, while con-
taining the melancholy lyrics of 
Sumner; “One day at a time, inch 
by inch/For every kiss, on lovers’ 
lips/For all lost souls, who can’t 
come home/Friends not here, we 
shared our tears.” 
With a sold-out, eleven-date 
European/U.K. tour kicking off in 
November, it would appear that 
New Order is back to “business 
as usual” even with the absence 
of Peter Hook, who has spent his 
time touring with his new group, 
Peter Hook & the Light, perform-
ing classic Joy Division and New 
Order songs. “Music Complete” 
gives fans eleven new works of 
sonic art to cherish, and these 
new releases add to the group’s 
already-sterling repertoire. Morris 
commented on the album title, 
and cleared the air of speculation 
concerned with Music Complete 
being New Order’s “swan song” 
to Idolator.com;
“The title [‘Music Complete’] 
was supposed to be based on the 
music style…It was only after-
wards we thought, ‘Oh my god, it 
sounds a bit final.’ ‘Music Com-
plete’ has a lot of different things 
on it. It’s not all dance, it’s not 
all guitar; it’s a bit of everything, 
really. That’s why we thought it 
would be quite a good title, not 
because it’s going to be the last 
thing we do.”

“Et tu, Brutus?” 
The line from William Shake-
speare’s famous play, “Julius 
Caesar,” has been heard around 
the world, remade in numerous 
adaptations, and is now being 
produced by the University at 
Albany. The Performing Arts 
Center has teamed up with the 
American Shakespeare Center, 
whom are performing in 20 loca-
tions in over 10 states. The show 
will take place Oct. 20 at 7:30 
p.m. Advance tickets are $15 for 
the general public and $10 for 
students, seniors and UAlbany 
faculty-staff. 
The play is being supported 
by the Writers Institute and the 
College of Arts and Science and 
will include live acoustic music 
and a performance true to Shake-
spearian style. The following 
interview with Chris Bellinger, 
who will be portraying Caesar 
himself, discusses what this play 
will bring about.
Q: How is this production 
bringing something new to this 
story?
Chris Bellinger: I think 
that every production brings 
something new just because of 
who’s doing it, that changes 
from production to production. 
I actually think we are trying to 
put something new by bringing 
something old which has to do 
with Shakespeare original lines 
and towards this show in particu-
lar - they have period costuming. 
So this is as close as people get 
to seeing the show as it actually 
looked. And I think that is actu-
ally pretty exciting and fun to 
see. It’s far more fun than what 
your English teacher leads you 
to believe.  
Q: Who in the show is most 
like their character? 
CB: Gosh, nobody in the play 
is really nice so I hope no one is 
like their character... Josh Innerst 
plays Brutus, I guess he would 
be most like his character. Bru-
tus is a steady guy, you know? 

He thinks everything through, 
he’s kind of private. That sounds 
like Josh, not that I think Josh is 
going to stab me in the back any-
time soon but Brutus has a lot of 
great qualities so I’m going to go 
with that since everybody else’s 
in the show are not as nice.  
Q: Are there any similarities 
with you and Caesar?
CB: Of course there are for 
me, that’s kind of how you 
play a character, one of the first 
things you do is find out how 
they are like you. You can’t just 
put Caesar as ‘that guy’ who’s 
the jerk, he is more like ‘that 
guy’ who knows everybody’s 
name, who’s actively involved 
in the people that he deals with 
but ultimately has people who 
think that his vision doesn’t 
match up with the vision of the 
people around him. Even when 
he’s angry it’s not because he’s 
a jerk it’s just because he wants 
desperately for things to go well, 
I think we can all relate to that. 
There is a quote I go by that goes 
“You don’t have to like your 
character but you have to love 
your character.” Nobody ever 
believes that they are evil, not 
just on stage but in real life, you 
have to understand because they 
have to have reason to do things 
beyond, “I’m evil and I’m going 
to do this because I’m evil,” 
nobody thinks like that because 
that’s not how real people func-
tion.
Q: What is the biggest 
challenge about taking on this 
role?
CB: The biggest challenge is 
that he’s temperamental and so 
there are a lot of moments when 
he is nice but stern and then he 
switches out on a lot of people. 
When his emotions change you 
have to justify in your head all 
the reasons why he suddenly 
gets mad or upset. And that’s 
a challenge, just going through 
those changes and that’s prob-
ably the thing I’ve worked the 
hardest on over the course of the 
rehearsal.

Q: How long did you re-
hearse for the show?
CB: We rehearse for about 
two and a half weeks to each 
show that we do. We spent about 
two months with those three 
shows and touring. We not only 
rehearse the show but also the 
music that we play throughout.
Q: Do you ever get star-
struck?
CB: I manage not to get too 
starstruck. I might have to take 
big breathes before I go see them 
but the cool thing about theatre 
is I think it helps me realize 
that they are just people even if 
they are people you respect and 
admire but at least it helps you 
think before you speak.
Q: What is the last thing you 
do before you go up on stage?
CB: Well I take deep 
breathes, especially in Shake-
speare where you have these 
long lines and such. Another 
thing we do is go up and stretch 
and some people do yoga just to 
help them relax. I try to say my 
lines before the show and take a 
moment to be still and take deep 
breathes.
Q: What do you enjoy most 
about your job? 
CB: I love everything we do, 
I love the traveling, I love the 
performing. In about 1996 I was 
in high school and I saw them 
perform the first live Shake-
speare and I said to myself “I 
want to do that!” and I put it off 
for about 20 years until my wife 
convinced me to. So this is like 
my dream job ever since I was 
young, so the best thing I like 
my job is the fact that I have my 
job. Just being able to be on that 
stage and do Shakespeare the 
way we do Shakespeare at this 
company with the original stag-
ing and it’s just really fun… it’s 
just really cool.

for extra 
time spent 
with 
students, 
for her 
additional 
contact hours teaching a three hour course, or for 
her work on art exhibits that she says improve her 
abilities as a professor. She has no office of her 
own, and often has to carry her laptop with her 
when she leaves her room because she has nowhere 
safe to keep it. Since she only teaches one class 
at UAlbany, she is dependent on her husband for 
health insurance. Tolley can’t afford to return to 
school or look elsewhere for work for fear it may 
compromise the security offered by her husband’s 
job.
“I’m hesitant to encourage my students who tell 
me they’re interested in teaching,” she said. “Some 
of us have Ph.D.s but struggle to get jobs.”
Tolley echoed Mckenna’s belief that campus 
expansion was a poorly prioritized allocation of 
funds when contingents are earning so little.
“You can’t beautify things on campus while the 
inside rots,” she said. 
Tolley expressed a desire to teach more classes 
but felt with the current rate of pay, it wasn’t worth 
it. 
Adjuncts and contingents are especially 
difficult to organize because of the nature of their 
employment, typically balancing other work and 
family life. 
“They have other jobs and a family at home. 
They don’t have time to march,” Tolley said, 
referencing a teacher at Hudson Valley who 
recently had a child and only brings in around 
$24,000 per year. 
Another issue is the lack of job security 

while criticizing the university. Without tenure, 
contingents can risk losing their jobs if they speak 
out. Tolley says she’s aware of the dangers but says 
she has little to lose. 
“I feel more prideful of my work to the union, 
contributing ideas,” she said.
Last school year, the UUP held numerous events 
on campus to call attention to contingent issues, 
including a union workshop to discuss the state of 
contingent affairs and tabling during International 
Workers’ Day. At the contingency workshop, it was 
discovered that many contingents falsely believed 
they were unionized with the UUP. 
Tolley attributes this confusion to a contract 
between the university and the UUP that gives 
all workers, union or not, benefits such as health 
insurance if they teach two or more classes. As a 
result, some contingents believe they are union 
despite them having no vote or say in union affairs 
such as the UUP’s upcoming contract negotiations 
with the administration. 
President of the Albany chapter of the UUP Bret 
Benjamin believes this semester will be better for 
the fight for contingents and said they are being 
kept in mind for the upcoming contract negotiations 
with the university. He says the UUP is hoping to 
raise the per class salary to $5,000, and wishes to 
see the per class rate pegged to the salary of full 
time lecturers who make around $40,000 per year. 
He also stressed the need for a path to full-time 
positions and tenure for those who want it, pointing 
out tenure as especially important in a career closely 
associated with speaking out against injustice. 
“The whole premise of academic freedom that 
underpins the university relies on tenure,” he argued 
against the idea that tenure isn’t often provided for 
other professions. “You don’t want to race for the 
bottom, you want to race to the top.”

with double mint bubble gum and 
prepackaged cakes and candies. 
She had known White since 
she was 15, when they lived in 
the same housing complex in 
Albany. She said he was even 
quiet back then. “He never came 
outside. He’s always been quiet. 
He was friendly, he just kept to 
himself,” she recalled, tears in 
her eyes.
White had a deep and smooth 
voice that every man wished he 
had, Scott Birge said, director 
of Campus Center Management. 
Birge knew him 11 years ago, 
back when White worked at 
Executive Cleaners, the private 
cleaning company that cleaned 
the Campus Center before 
UAlbany switched to in-house 
cleaners. White worked the night 
shifts back then as well. Birge 
put in a recommendation for 
White to stay with the university 
once it transitioned.
He had an offbeat sense of 
humor, recalled Ann Trudeau, 
head janitor for nights. “It wasn’t 
your ordinary sense of humor,” 
she said. “He thought it was 
funny that when we needed an 
emergency contact number that 
he would give us a pizza shop’s 
number.” 
Earl Crichlow, an employee 
in the receiving department, 
worked with White during the 
Executive Cleaners days and 
was one of the three employees, 
including White, who were 
kept after the transition. He said 
White was a muscular man who 
had a special sweeping technique 
that could clean floors better 
than a vacuum. He remembers 
him being quiet but, when he did 
speak, he had a speaking voice 
similar to Barry White’s.
They would talk about sports 
since they were both Knicks and 
Giants fans. Crichlow said, “I 
liked playing basketball and he 

would say, ‘I’m going to come 
out there and show you how to 
do this.’ He never, ever did but 
I’m quite sure that if he would 
have, I would have had my hands 
full.”
 Above all else, even above the 
quietness, White was a dedicated 
worker. 
The setups in the Campus 
Center for any event Monday 
through Friday were most likely 
done by White. Even though 
people may not have known him, 
he did things for them.
He took a lot of pride in the 
way his floors looked, especially 
in the terrazzo of the Campus 
Center, Trudeau explained. “He 
had it looking the best that it has 
in a long time, even through all 
that construction work that’s 
been ongoing over there. His 
floors always looked good,” 
Trudeau said.
White never called in sick. 
“We had to force him to take 
time off,” Trudeau said. He 
would give his days off to 
coworkers, she explained. “He’d 
give up weeks at a time because 
he’d never use it himself. He was 
very generous like that to people 
he did not even have any contact 
with.”
“He wasn’t particularly 
outgoing at all. He kept to 
himself and he did great work,“ 
Birge said. “A conversation 
with Dexter was fairly short, 
it was fairly quiet, but it was 
always pleasurable. He was a real 
gentleman.”
The custodial staff penned 
a statement after the news of 
his death. “It will be hard to 
replace him,” it read. “There are 
absolutely no words to explain 
the loss we are feeling. He will 
be sorely missed.”
White was a man of few 
words, but will be remembered 
for his dedication to his job. He 
worked meticulously, finding 
pleasure in his completed tasks, 
and he passed away in the place 
where he showed the most pride.

On Thursday afternoon, the home of the Great Danes’ 
sports teams got a name change. 
Thanks to a $10 million gift from The Bernard and 
Millie Children’s Foundation, the University at Albany’s 
main stadium was named Tom & Mary Casey Stadium. 
The field will now be known as Bob Ford Field at Casey 
Stadium. 
“This is a historic day for our athletic program and 
our university history,” UAlbany Athletic Director Mark 
Benson said. “This is a gift that’s going to impact all 
of our student athletes, all of our programs, the campus 
community, and the Capital Region. Not just for this 
moment, but for many generations to come.” 
William Duker, a member of the UAlbany class of 
1975 and son of Millie and Bernard Duker, established the 
foundation with his wife Sharon and their son West. The 
stadium was named in honor of Sharon (Casey) Duker’s 
parents. 
The $10 million gift is the largest one in university 
history, according to UAlbany President Robert J. Jones. 
“This gift reflects the wonderful values Tom and Mary 
Casey instilled in their children about the importance 
of education and service to community,” Jones said. 
“Through the Casey name, the stadium will represent the 
opportunities that are possible through excellent public 
higher education and outstanding collegiate athletics 
programs.” 

The gift will be used to care for the stadium and other 
facilities, increase student-athlete scholarships, and 
support athletic initiatives. Benson mentioned the need 
to renovate the SEFCU Arena, home of the men’s and 
women’s basketball teams.
“We need to renovate SEFCU [Arena] and make it 
another… world class facility,” Benson said. “That will be 
a high-priority project that we will look at but there will be 
many others.”
At the unveiling event on Thursday afternoon, the Casey 
family had a chance to marvel at their name high above 
the field on a beautiful fall day. Thomas Casey is Sharon 
(Casey) Duker’s sister and graduated from UAlbany in 
1978.  
“I’m still trying to get my arms wrapped around it,” 
Thomas Casey said. “To look up and see my family name 
up there, it’s just absolutely wonderful.”
Getting her chance to say thanks was UAlbany 
volleyball team Captain Laini Leindecker. She was the 
only student-athlete to speak at the event.
“I know that my fellow student athletes and I will 
benefit tremendously from the generosity of this gift,” 
Leindecker said. “I’m confident students will see the value 
of what was given to them here at the University at Albany 
and will get back in the future.”
Leindecker also introduced a new sandwich named after 
the Casey family. The Casey corned beef sammy will be 
served at concession stands throughout the facility. 
Toward the end of the event, before the football team 

practiced in the newly named stadium, the team walked 
down the field carrying two banners thanking the Casey 
family for their support. 
“I think $10 million certainly gives you a chance to call 
a few plays if you want,” UAlbany football Coach Greg 
Gattuso joked. “We certainly will accept the help.”
In their first game in the newly renamed stadium, the 
Great Danes may have needed the help, as they were 
crushed 39-7 by Maine on Saturday afternoon.

By DIANA HYMOWITZ

A Saturday afternoon that started 
out filled with excitement and emotion 
quickly turned sour as the Maine Black 
Bears pummeled the University at 
Albany Great Danes on homecoming 
weekend with a final score of 39-7 at 
Bob Ford Field at Casey Stadium.
The homecoming game was a 
sellout - 8,500 fans came to cheer at 
the first game since the stadium’s name 
was changed on Thursday afternoon. 
However, most fans went home 
disappointed as the game turned into a 
rout. 
“We’re not a very good football team 
right now in a lot of ways,” UAlbany 
Coach Greg Gattuso said postgame. 
“But I assure everyone we are working 
very hard trying to fix the problems that 
we have.”
The first drive that each team 
composed was indicative of how the 
rest of the game would go. 
The Great Danes’ first drive was 
filled with mediocre protection for 
quarterback DJ Crook, mental mistakes 
and penalties that resulted in a punt. 
On the flipside, the Black Bears’ first 
drive was filled with great protection for 
quarterback Dan Collins, with effective 
downhill running and a touchdown pass 
to Jordan Dunn that put the visiting 

team up 7-0. 
The fast start by the Black Bears (2-3, 
2-1 CAA) and Collins was too much 
for the Great Danes (2-4, 1-2 CAA) to 
handle. By the end of the first quarter, 
they were down 20-0 after one-yard 
touchdown runs by Dan Collins and 
Nigel Beckford. 
However, the offense was able to 
construct a drive with two minutes and 
21 seconds left to go in the half, cutting 
the Black Bears lead to 20-7. 
Crook and the Danes, trying to use 
the momentum of scoring a touchdown, 
began going downfield using a fast, no 
huddle offense. But with 13 seconds left 
to go Crook threw a crucial interception 
that the Bears quickly converted into a 
field goal to take a 23-7 halftime lead.
 Coming out of halftime, the Danes 
were able to force Collins into throwing 
an interception by Rayshan Clark on the 
opening drive, but the offense couldn’t 
capitalize on it and were forced to go 
three and out. 
The rest of the third and fourth 
quarters were filled with the same 
type of play as the first two: Sloppy, 
inefficient playing by the Great Danes 
and effective, punishing football from 
the Black Bears, which led to a final 
score of 39-7 Maine. 
Although the Great Danes did not 
have many positives to take away from 

their play against Maine, they were able 
to witness a breakout performance by 
freshman Zee Roberson. As Crook’s top 
target, Roberson hauled in a career-high 
nine receptions for 102 receiving yards 
and a touchdown. 
UAlbany’s offense managed just six 
first downs and a total of five rushing 
yards on the day. Maine outgained 
UAlbany 469-172.
 One positive note was redshirt junior 
cornerback Rayshan Clark, who tied 
a UAlbany Division I record with 18 
tackles in the game, 17 of which were 
solo tackles. 
The past two weeks have forced the 
Great Danes to rely more and more on 
young players, such as Roberson, to 
produce veteran numbers against tough 
opponents. 
 “It’s kind of a catch-22 in the sense 
of we have limited packaging because 
we are so young and we’re playing 
against teams that are pretty good,” 
Gattuso said. “We’ve just got to keep 
working on what we’re doing and 
hopefully we can start expanding our 
packaging.”
UAlbany hopes the young players 
can step up to fill some of the voids 
left due to injury as they head to next 
week’s CAA clash against Villanova at 
Casey Stadium at 3:30 p.m.
