Students gathered around the Main Fountain by the Lecture Centers on Thursday to honor Sunny Kim, a UAlbany and Kappa 
Phi Lambda alum who was murdered in South Korea over the summer. 

By JONATHON 
PETERS

University at 
Albany’s Asian 
interest sorority Kappa 
Phi Lambda was 
disturbed to discover 
what happened to one 
of their sisters this past 
summer.
Alumna Sunny Kim 
was murdered by her 
ex-boyfriend in South 
Korea. Her body was 
taken to a desolate area 
and buried in cement, 
police reported. Kim 
ended their relationship 
days before because 
of his prior domestic 
abuse.
Kappa Phi 
Lambda’s publicity 
chair, Tianna Le, 
wanted to know how 
something like this 
could have happened. 
“Her death sounded 
like something right 
out of a horror movie,” 
Le said. 
The members of 
the organization’s 
Upsilon chapter 
visited the UAlbany 
administration. They 
believed something 
needed to be done 
about Kim’s death, as 
well as all the other 
domestic violence 
cases around the world.
The organization 
hosted “Shine the 
Light,” a week of 
open events to spread 
awareness of domestic 
violence and to educate 
the community on the 
lasting effects it can 
have on the victims. 
The week consisted of 
self-defense training, 
workshops, movie 
screenings, and was 
concluded with an 
honorary candle 
lighting at the Main 
Fountain on Thursday.
People gathered 
at the fountain to 
hear speeches, and 

the sorority sisters read 
poems.  As they lit the 
candles, there was a 
moment of silence for 
Kim. Kappa members 
then encouraged anyone 
who had been or knew 
a victim to share their 
experience.  “She was 
an alumna and from my 
chapter,” Le said. “We 
had to make sure we did 
this night right.” 
UAlbany was one 
of 10 schools selected 
to host a “10 Points of 
Light” candle lighting in 
memory of a domestic 
violence victim.  Take 
Back the Night is an 
organization working 
to raises awareness of 
sexual violence. Every 
April and October, 
chosen schools host the 
“10 Points of Light” 
event on the same night.
Many students and 
faculty came out to 
support the sorority’s 
cause. Student 
Involvement Assistant 
Director Arleny 
Alvarez-Peña said 
everything ran smoothly 
from the sideline on 
Thursday. “Tonight 
provides healing for our 
community,” Alvery-
Peña said. She said it’s 
ceremonies like these that 
bring people together and 
help them grow. 
The chapter spent the 
month raising money 
and collecting supplies 
for women that have 
been victims of abusive 
relationships. A colorful 
assortment of products 
- beauty supplies, 
shampoos, soaps, and 
toothpaste - were laid 
out at the entrance of the 
candle lighting. People 
made care packages with 
personalized messages to 
send to Equinox, a shelter 
in the Capital District that 
assists domestic violence 
victims as well as victims 
of substance abuse and 
mental illness.

UAlbany, pronouns, 
and gender identity

President Jones gives 2015 
State of the University address

By MADELINE ST. 
AMOUR

After Yoonhee Kim, 
a University at Albany 
senior, “chopped her hair 
off,” people sometimes 
called her “sir” when she 
worked at Stewart’s. Once 
customers heard her talk, 
they’d correct themselves. 
Kim said she felt “out of 
place.” 
“It’s actually really sad. 
It’s like, ‘Um, I don’t know 
who you’re talking to,’” 
she said. 

For some students, 
their gender identity isn’t 
something that crosses 
their mind.
“That’s what privilege 
is,” Courtney D’Allaird, 
coordinator for the Gender 
and Sexuality Resource 
Center at UAlbany, said. 
“When you have some-
thing, and you never have 
to think about it.”
But for others, gender 
identity matters a great 
deal. Being free to choose 
what they are called is im-
portant for some students, 

and a college’s policies can 
either help or hinder this.
As originally reported 
by The Harvard Crimson, 
Harvard University’s stu-
dent newspaper, Harvard 
now allows students to pick 
their preferred pronouns 
when they register. They 
can choose from tradi-
tionally male or female 
pronouns, as well as write 
in others, using given 
examples like the gender-
neutral “they, them theirs”

University at Albany 
President Robert Jones de-
livered his fall 2015 State 
of the University address 
Tuesday. The president 
spent the hour highlighting 
the university’s achieve-
ments as well as future 
goals. 
Among the achieve-
ments. was a National 
Science Foundation grant 
of $4.5 million awarded to 
a team of atmospheric and 
social scientists which in-

cluded UAlbany’s Everette 
Joseph. The grant will go 
toward research in early 
warning systems for detec-
tion of large storms. Jones 
also praised the launch of 
the College of Emergency 
Preparedness, Homeland 
Security and Cybersecurity 
in response to a call from 
the governor for university 
programs in those fields. 
He also mentioned an af-
filiation agreement made 
this month with Albany 
Law School and a $1.6 
million grant given to 

a joint faculty team for an 
international health law 
project from the Global 
Institute for Health and 
Human Rights.
Jones praised what he 
called the university’s 
commitment to diversity, 
claiming that 42 percent 
of the freshman class 
were students of color. He 
expressed a desire to enroll 
20,000 students by 2020, 
saying that developing pro-

DANES SAY WHAT?

“For me it’s 50/50. I feel safe walking around 
the UAlbany campus because I know that there 
are safety precautions taken in case a shooting 
or another major tragedy were to occur. UPD 
is constantly doing their job by patrolling all 
of campus, so it makes me feel safe that they 
are out during all times of the day. Then again, 
there could be that one student or outsider that 
can enter our campus freely and potentially be a 
danger to the UAlbany community. It is a scary 
thought, but I just have to assure myself that 
everything will be okay.

- Crystal Matos, Class of 2016

This week, we asked students: 

In light of recent school shootings, do you feel safe on 
UAlbany’s campus?

Compiled by Vaughnee 
Simmons

“With so many assaults and shootings happening, 
it’s hard to feel safe on campus. It makes you 
wonder if you’ll be the next student in an email 
sent by UPD. Personally, I do not feel 100 percent 
safe on the UAlbany campus. When I am coming 
home from rugby practice or from the library at 
night, there’s always a little bit of doubt in my mind 
that something could happen. I understand that 
this is a public campus and anyone can be here, 
but I  believe UAlbany should put more effort into 
keeping their students safe on campus.  Sending out 
emails informing students on how to stay safe on 
campus during the school year is not enough. UPD 
should be more productive! The only peace of my 
mind I get on this campus is when I ask God for 
protection and to keep me safe daily. “

- Janay Bailey, Class of 2016

“I do feel safe on the UAlbany campus. 
Sometimes I do come across people that I 
am wary of, but overall I feel fine. I don’t 
think there needs to be armed security 
guards all over campus or anything, but 
I feel that a safe environment should 
be promoted. UAlbany has a safe 
environment and I don’t feel like I am in 
danger.”

MIDDLE EARTH

Dear Middle Earth,
 I’ve been thinking about 
going to Counseling and 
Psychological Services to 
talk with somebody about 
some problems I’ve been 
having. I feel weird about it 
though. My life isn’t easy, 
but I’m not completely fall-
ing apart either, so I don’t 
even know if counseling is 
really something I need. I 
guess I really want to talk 
to someone, but I’m afraid 
that if I go I’ll be seen as sort 
of messed up, like there’s 
something really wrong with 
me. Also, if I get counseling, 
will it show up in my uni-
versity record? I don’t really 
want my parents or anybody 
else to know – could they 
find out? How much does 
it cost, and how do I pay? 
I have health insurance 
through my parents, but like 
I said, I’d rather not have 
them find out. Will they just 
recommend taking medica-
tion because I don’t think I 
want that! Any information 
you could give would help. 
Thanks!
- Wondering
Dear Wondering,
I’m so glad you asked 
these questions! If you have 
these types of questions 
about Counseling and Psy-
chological Services (CAPS), 
you’re probably not the 
only one on campus who is 
wondering these things. First 
of all, I want to assure you 
that if you want to talk about 
problems you’re having, 
CAPS is a good place for 
you to come. Acknowledg-
ing that you want some help 
with difficulties you are hav-
ing is sometimes hard, but 
it is the first step in working 
to resolve those difficul-
ties. Every year, hundreds 
of students seek help for 
both personal and academic 
concerns, and thousands 
of students participate in 
our educational programs 
involving residence halls, 
student groups, and orienta-

tion programs. 
Anyone who is currently 
enrolled at the University 
at Albany may use CAPS, 
and counseling is free. The 
staff at CAPS includes 
licensed psychologists and 
psychology interns and 
advanced doctoral students 
who provide services under 
the supervision of licensed 
staff psychologists. You can 
view pictures and bios of 
all the staff on their website 
(www.albany.edu/counsel-
ing_center). What you tell 
a counselor at CAPS is 
confidential. Your visits 
and conversations do not 
become part of any other 
record. CAPS is located at 
400 Patroon Creek Blvd., 
Suite 104 and there is a free 
shuttle that leaves from 
Collins Circle and the Social 
Sciences bus stop approxi-
mately every 30 minutes. It 
is open all year. During the 
academic year, hours are 
from 8:30 a.m. to 5:00 p.m. 
Monday through Friday, 
and during the summer and 
inter-session, it is open Mon-
day through Friday from 
8:00 a.m. to 4:00 p.m. You 
can call 518-442-5800 or 
come to the reception desk 
to make an appointment. It is 
also O.K. to request a specif-
ic staff member, or request 
the gender of the person you 
meet with if that is important 
to you. CAPS also offers 
couples counseling and 
various therapy and support 
groups each semester.
When you arrive for the 
first time, you will be asked 
to complete some paper-
work on one of the secure 
computers in the wait-
ing room which will help 
describe your concerns and 
provide other information 
that will assist your clinician 
in getting to know you. The 
focus of your first appoint-
ment will be to speak with a 
clinician to understand the 
issues you are facing and to 
consider a plan of action for 

dealing with those issues. At 
the end of that appointment 
you can decide together how 
to proceed, which may be to 
make another appointment 
with that staff member or 
another option.
You also asked about 
medication which is a very 
good question. This is a per-
sonal decision and the staff 
at CAPS will respect your 
views on the use or non-use 
of medication to assist with 
your concerns. For some 
situations the use of medica-
tion could be suggested as an 
additional treatment option 
by a referral to the doctors 
at Student Health Services. 
The decision will be yours 
and we encourage you to be 
open with the psychologist 
and discuss your feelings on 
this.
Another option is the 
Let’s Talk program. This 
service provides informal 
and confidential conversa-
tions with CAPS staff at 
various locations on campus. 
No appointment is neces-
sary. Let’s Talk could be a 
good way to try out what it 
might be like to meet with 
a psychologist or to get a 
different perspective of a 
particular situation.
Finally, the Middle Earth 
Hotline is also available to 
talk more about the ser-
vices that CAPS provides 
or to further discuss how to 
decide if it would be a good 
idea to make an appoint-
ment. You can reach the 
Middle Earth Peer Assis-
tance hotline at 518-442-
5777. The Middle Earth Peer 
Assistance hotline is free, 
anonymous, and open when 
classes at UAlbany are in 
session during the academic 
year (September through 
May). The hotline hours 
are from 1 p.m. to midnight 
Monday through Thursday 
and 24 hours on weekends 
beginning on Friday at 1 
p.m. and ending on Sunday 
at midnight.

The race for Albany County Executive is on

By PAT GAREAU

Incumbent Dan McCoy 
(D-Albany) is facing off against 
candidates Joseph Vitollo (R- 
Coeymans) and Dan Platt (Green 
Party-Albany) in the race for 
Albany County Executive.
While McCoy ran unopposed 
in his first election in 2011, 
this year he faced a contentious 
Democratic primary against Dan 
Egan (D-Albany), which McCoy 
was able to win with 60 percent of 
the vote. 
McCoy is a heavy favorite to be 

reelected, and one of the things he 
would like to do in his second term 
is engage University at Albany 
students. He believes it is important 
for students at the university to be 
aware of what is going on in the 
surrounding area.
“You need to pay attention to 
where you live because you are part 
of the community,” McCoy said 
about students. A specific example 
that he said had been considered 
by his team is to partner with the 
university to provide a bus tour 
of the area to new students at the 
beginning of each academic year.

McCoy said the county 
government already interacts 
with the university in many areas 
including emergency services, and 
described the relationship between 
the two entities as a “partnership.” 
McCoy, an Iraq War veteran, 
was a firefighter before being 
sworn in as Albany County 
Executive in 2012.
Dan Platt, who was involved 
with Occupy Albany while the 
group was active, said he is running 
to “occupy the ballot.” He said, 
“I didn’t want Dan McCoy to run 
unopposed.”

Platt wants to localize 
the economy and introduce 
participatory budgeting in to the 
process, where funds are set aside 
to be voted on at the community 
level. He believes the government 
should take a more active role in 
producing food and energy locally. 
Platt hopes to make progress on 
these issues over the long term and 
wants to reach out more to younger 
residents of Albany County.
Vitollo, 59, currently works as a 
registered nurse.
UAlbany College Republicans 
President Pat Cronin believes 

the Republican’s lack of 
competitiveness in this election 
is due to insufficient outreach in 
urban communities. “There is 
nothing about Republican ideas 
that are antithetical to urban voters. 
It’s not a policy issue, it’s more of 
an approach and messaging issue,” 
Cronin said.
Vitollo and Platt have each 
spent less than $1,000 on the 
election, while McCoy has spent 
over $400,000, as reported by the 
Albany Times Union.

Homelessness isn’t just a 
problem for adults. During the 
2013-14 year, 2,000 school-age 
children were without homes in 
the Capital Region, as reported 
from data compiled at New 
York’s Education Department. 
This information takes into 
account children living in motels, 
shelters or staying with other 
people, along with those who 
don’t have any place to stay.
“From New York to Buffalo, 
homelessness has been on a 
trajectory that’s unsustainable,” 
William Gettman Jr., the 
executive director of St. 
Catherine’s Center for children, 
said in a 2014 Times Union 
article.
The amount of children 
without homes has been 
increasing over the past five 
years, according to data from the 
New York State Technical and 
Education Assistance Center. 
There were 90,596 children 
identified as homeless in the 
years 2010-11 in the state. By the 
next year the number jumped to 
98,174, and by the last recorded 
year on the website, 2013-2014, 
the number had climbed to 
116,847 children without homes 
in New York.
Overall in New York the 

amount of children who 
are considered homeless 
has doubled in a five-year 
span. It’s sad that we live 
in a state (and country) 
where child homelessness 
is becoming a major issue. 
This is a problem that we 
must actively try to prevent 
from getting worse. There 
are a number of things 
that New York can to do 
decrease the amount of 
homeless people out there.
The Coalition for 
the Homelessness is 
a New York-based 
organization dedicated 
to helping homeless men, 
women and children. It says that 
permanent housing assistance 
is less expensive than shelter 
or institutional care. These 
successful programs can come 
from federal housing assistance 
or from permanent supportive 
housing, which both provide 
long-term housing options for the 
homeless.
The Coalition also mentions 
that making sure homeless 
people and families can maintain 
their new housing is crucial, as 
many homeless people are often 
unable to have stability in these 
situations. Eviction-prevention 

grants are one way to allow new 
tenants the ability to pay their 
rent so that they don’t get evicted 
and become homeless again. 
Another way to prevent this is 
to provide low-income families 
and people with housing lawyers 
that they can afford.
There are many other 
things that can help decrease 
homelessness in our state. 
Raising the minimum wage 
will help low-income families 
afford their expenses. Career 
programs for low-income and 
homeless people are crucial, as 
many of these people need jobs. 
Also, just a general awareness of 
homelessness and its increasing 

numbers should make people 
want to contribute and volunteer 
to prevent it from worsening. 
All of these suggestions would 
help out, but programs that get 
people into houses are the most 
beneficial to the issue. 
Albany has many homeless 
shelters available for those in 
need. 
The Capital City Gospel 
Mission is a non-profit charity 
located on South Pearl Street. 
Its mission is to proclaim the 
teachings of the Gospel and Jesus 
Christ to the needy and homeless 
in the Capital Region. It provides 
a cleansing of the “body, mind, 
and spirit” so that the people who 

come through its doors can rejoin 
society as a mature Christian 
citizen. 
“I was homeless in Albany and 
addicted. Now I’m a sinner saved 
by God’s read,” a person named 
Bobby said on the Capital City 
Gospel Mission’s website. 
Another option is the Homeless 
and Travelers Aid Society of the 
Capital Region, which has two 
locations on Central Avenue 
and State Street. Both are open 
24 hours a day to make sure 
someone has a place to stay. They 
welcome homeless families and 
their children, teen parents, and 
youths to their shelters.
 

T

he truth about homelessness is that it’s 
becoming a major issue in New York 
state. The number of homeless people 
has been notably increasing over recent years 
for the state overall.

Actress, singer and “The 
View” co-host Raven-
Symoné has recently 
received backlash for 
making controversial 
comments regarding race 
and police brutality on the 
talk show. 
Her name may sound 
familiar to young people 
who grew up watching 
her hit Disney Channel 
television show “That’s 
So Raven,” while older 
generations may recognize 
her from “The Cosby 
Show” from around the 
early 1990s. Now she’s 
getting attention for a 
negative reason.
Perhaps the most 
recent controversy 
involved Raven-Symoné 
commenting about the viral 
Spring Valley High School 
incident in which a sheriff 
violently sent a student to 
the ground during class 
time.
While reviewing the viral 
video during an episode 
of “The View,” Raven-
Symoné believed that teens 
“should put [their] phones 
away” and that they “have 
to understand authority.” 
This stirred up angry and 
negative responses from 
viewers over Twitter 
who believed that Raven-
Symoné was saying what 
the sheriff did was O.K.
Both the student and the 
sheriff were at fault for 
their individual actions. 
While I understood how 
Raven-Symoné argues 
that teens should respect 
authority, I would have 
focused on the sheriff’s 
actions more than the 
teenager’s. 

When the incident 
grew viral, the hashtag 
#SpringValleyAssault 
was used. This hashtag’s 
wording focuses on the 
sheriff’s assault on the 
student, not the phone-
wielding student. So, to 
deviate from the main issue 
- the sheriff’s violence - 
seems to ignore how the 
sheriff truly treated the 
student.
Raven-Symoné’s 
comments, regardless of 
causing controversy, did 
actually touch on how teens 
need to learn when are the 
appropriate times to use 
their electronic devices, 
something I thought was 
the only redeeming thing 
about her take on the 
incident. 
I believe that teens 
should understand how 
imperative getting an 
education is. While I 
know how tempting it is 
to secretly use my iPhone 
in class, I try to push it off 
because getting a higher 
education costs a lot of 
money. So, it’s important to 
recognize and embrace the 
fact that we, as University 
at Albany students, are 
lucky to go to college in the 
first place. But we should 
still never be victims of 
police brutality.
Raven-Symoné also 
was the center of another 
controversy during another 
episode of “The View” 
when she said she would 
not hire anyone who has a 
“black-sounding” name, a 
statement that deals with 
institutional racism.
“I’m not about to 
hire you if your name is 
Watermelondrea,” she said, 
“It’s just not gonna happen. 

I’m not gonna hire you.”
Her comments came off 
racist and discriminatory 
against people with such 
names and I am completely 
against what she said. It 
is tragic when a person, 
despite potentially having 
a great resume, still would 
not be employed because 
a potential employer 
may equate their “black-
sounding” name with a lack 
of intelligence. 
Growing up, I vividly 
remembered that a 2005 
“That’s So Raven” episode 
dealt with racism and 
that the Disney Channel 
had been praised for 
addressing such a dark 
subject to young viewers. 
The episode titled “True 
Colors” was about how 
Raven-Symoné’s character, 
Raven Baxter, attempted to 
get a job at a store but was 
rejected despite proving 
how qualified she was. 
Instead, her character’s best 
friend, Chelsea Daniels 
(played by Anneliese van 
der Pol), who is white, 
got the job despite lacking 
experience. 
Raven-Symoné then 
deduces that she was 
rejected only because the 
manager was racist and 
she and Chelsea eventually 
confronted the racist 
manager. The episode 
managed to educate viewers 
that racism is wrong but 
is still present in modern 
times. Fast forward 10 
years to 2015, when Raven-
Symoné says she would 
not hire someone with a 
“black-sounding” name. It 
is heartbreaking that this is 
where she has come.

That’s so rude, 

Raven!

hina’s decade-old policy of 
limiting a family to one child 
has ended, but I don’t think that 
is enough. 
The New York Times reported recently 
that the Chinese Communist Party 
leadership decided to revise a policy from 
the 1970s which limited a Chinese family 
to only one child. The policy will now 
allow a family to have up to two children. 
Chris Buckley, author of the article, 
said, “The decision was a dramatic step 
away from a core Communist Party 
position that Deng Xiaoping, the Chinese 
leader who imposed the policy in the late 
1970s, once said was needed to ensure 
that ‘the fruits of economic growth are not 
devoured by population growth.’”
In 2013, according to the New York 
Times, the policy was eased a bit allowing 
a family to have two children if one of 
the parents was an only child, though 
oftentimes the parents would refuse to 
have a second child on their own saying 
it would be too expensive to raise two 
children in the Chinese economy.
Perhaps coming from a larger family 
gives me a different outlook on the 

bearing of children, but it seems ludicrous 
to take away the right of a couple to bear 
more than one child. 
It has also severely affected the male-
to-female ratio in China, favoring boys 
and men. 
However, I suppose this new policy is 
a step in the right direction. The Chinese 
Communist leaders are giving the Chinese 
population more power over their own 
human rights.
Buckley writes, “Thursday’s 
announcement was the highlight of a 
party meeting at which President Xi 
Jinping sought to display his control over 
a flagging economy after a jittery summer 
of tepid indicators, deepening skepticism 
about official data and a tumultuous slide 
in the stock market.”
This policy change is going to have 
a drastic change on population in 
China as well as the funds necessary to 
support more children. Buckley reports, 
“Abolishing the one-child policy would 
‘increase labor supply and ease pressures 
from an aging population,’ the National 
Health and Family Planning Commission, 
which enforces the policy, said in a 
statement issued after the party meeting. 
‘This will benefit sustained and healthy 

economic development,’ the commission 
said.”
This is most certainly necessary for the 
development of China’s freedom laws. 
However, I still fear that the Chinese 
would still not exercise this new law. 
The old policy has been ingrained in the 
culture for a long time and may be hard to 
break out of. 
As much as I would love to see the 
Chinese population grow from this new 
law, it is solely up to the people of China 
to make the decision to have more than 
one child.
My second fear is that this just simply 
isn’t enough. 
Allowing families to have another child 
is better than just the one, but still is far 
too limiting on people’s freedom to bear 
children. 
Perhaps the American perspective 
plays a huge factor in how I perceive this 
law, but I still feel like having children is 
a personal decision that should be made 
solely by the partners having children. 
Chinese policy has taken a necessary 
move toward a limitless world, but they 
are just not moving quick enough. 

One more child please

College partying is something we may not 
all take part in, but we all certainly hear about 
it. It is one of the reasons many students 
are eager to go to college. Unfortunately, 
it is also the reason some will never make 
it to graduation. According to the National 
Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism 
(NIAAA) roughly 1800 college students ages 
18 to 24 die each year from alcohol related 
injuries. A majority of the deaths are people 
under the legal drinking age. 
Last year the University at Albany had one 
of  its own students, Trevor Duffy, die as a 
direct result of alcohol consumption. 
Incidents like this raise a lot of controversy 
over who should be held responsible. Should 
the university be blamed? Should the people 
consuming the alcohol be blamed, or the ones 
who are of age and who are providing it to 
those who aren’t?
When a student enrolls in a school, it is 
their responsibility to follow all the school’s 
policies. It is against UAlbany’s policy to 
have alcohol anywhere on campus in the 
presence of minors. No school should be 
held responsible for what happens outside 
its grounds. The moment students leave 
campus, they can make choices to their own 

discretion, which should not reflect on the 
school.
Most students who take part in drinking 
know the effects of alcohol. They are fully 
aware of what excessive consumption can 
lead to. I think what some don’t know is 
their own limit, and others persuade them 
to keep going through peer pressure like in 
Duffy’s case. We all hear about those who 
die from alcohol poisoning and we all think 
it’s something that won’t happen to us, until 
it does.
After the death of Duffy, the Times Union 
reported that “Duffy was promised by the 
brothers of an underground fraternity that no 
one was ever killed while pledging.” 
Unfortunately, that is no longer true. 
Although his drinking was a result of hazing, 
alcohol was still the cause of death. It is still 
connected to one of the main problems on 
college campuses.  
The Times Union also reported that a 
student testified the brothers of the frat 
argued over whether or not they should call 
the cops. This is another issue surrounding 
alcohol-related deaths. Although I have 
never experienced alcohol poisoning, I have 
witnessed it. 
A close friend of mine in high school 
drank an excessive amount of liquor. By the 

time she was 
taken to the 
hospital, 
she was in 
an alcohol-
induced 
coma. 
Luckily she 
survived, but 
doctors told 
her mother 
that had they 
not called for 
help when 
they did, she 
would have 
died. 
If ever in 
this situation 
it is important 
to remember 
that a simple 
phone call can 
be the matter 
of life and death. 
In an interview with the Times Union, 
Michael Christakis, interim vice president 
of Student Success said, “The institution 
cannot be everywhere all the time… the most 
powerful deterrent is peer-to-peer.” 

Peers have the most influence over each 
other in social situations. It is O.K. to tell 
your friends that you think they have had 
enough or that they shouldn’t do something, 
even if you are the only one who feels that 
way. 

CONS OF UNDERAGE DRINKING

College students often binge drink because they are unaware of how 
much alcohol their bodies can handle. Underage drinking can result 
in legal problems.

This time of year, many legends 
of ghosts, serial killers and pol-
tergeists pop up to get people in 
the mood for Halloween. Some of 
these urban myths have their basis 
in our very own Capital Region.
The Albany area has decided to 
follow the popular trend of haunt-
ing tours. During the entire month 
of October, Albany residents 
could take the Capitol Haunting 
Tour. The expedition took people 
throughout the New York State 
Capitol Building downtown, 
showcasing all the places where 
paranormal activities have oc-
curred. The tour also informed 
guests about the history of the 

building.
“While we certainly do talk 
about the ghostly sightings, we 
also talk a lot about the history,” 
Stuart Lehman, one of the tour 
guides, said. “Every one of these 
stories is connected to events in 
Capitol history.”
While showing some behind-
the-scenes Capitol Building 
action, the tour also comes across 
a few supernatural disturbances. 
The Capitol is home to many mys-
teries, such as the ominous 1911 
building fire that took out much 
of the State Library, the cause of 
which still remains unknown. The 
watchman who died during the 
fire is said to still make his rounds 
at night.

The tour also showed a hidden 
carving of a demon in the build-
ing’s molding. 
“A stone carver was so angry 
with his boss one day that he 
decided to put a curse on the entire 
building by carving a secret devil 
into the stonework,” said Lehman.
Lehman also showed pictures 
taken in the building that have 
some ghostly-looking shapes in 
them. The tour was more history-
oriented, but there were still a few 
frights.
The Capitol Building could 
definitely has a ghost or two float-
ing around. 
“Many people have reported 
that if you work here late at night, 
you might hear the noise of doors 

closing,” Lehman said. “You 
might even see the doorknob to 
your office being turned.”
Lehman went on to say he has 
had some guests on the tour report 
some spectral sensitivity, but not 
to the extent they’ve had to leave 
the group.
“I really enjoyed the tour,” said 
Stephanie Oberting, an Albany 
resident. “I went with my family 
and enjoyed it so much that I went 
back to take the tour the next week 
a second time with my friend.”
Lehman, who is mostly called 
“steward” during the tour because 
of his outfit, has enjoyed being a 
tour guide for this event for over 
10 years. The demand of the tours 
this year was unexpected, causing 
more tour events to be added.
“The tours get reserved very 
quickly when they’re opened up,” 
he said. “We advertised it, expect-

ing that we’d get about 30 people, 
and 3,000 people called so it kind 
of grew exponentially from there.”
Lehman said that an average of 
1,500 people have taken the tour 
every October in past years. 
“All Capitol tours are free,” he 
said. “The tour doesn’t have a lot 
of special effects so it doesn’t cost 
a lot.”
“I think it’s great that the Capi-
tol has tours like this one for free,” 
said Oberting. “It’s smart that 
Albany tries to get its community 
involved with events.”
Lehman added that his favorite 
part of the Capitol Haunt is the 
mysterious 1911 fire, however he 
also mentioned that he does not 
believe in ghosts. 
“There certainly are a lot of rea-
sons to believe in ghosts,” he said. 
“But my experiences have been 
very subjective in nature.”

BRAVE ENOUGH TO 
FACE THE CAPITOL?

There isn’t any other band that 
embodies the college-age years 
like The Front Bottoms do. These 
late adolescent times are strange, 
fast moving moments that are deci-
sive of our futures, while equally 
regarded as the best days of our 
lives. 
As months feel like weeks and 
we have trouble recalling what 
happened last Saturday night, we 
long for something tangible to 
cling to. What we need is someone 
to shove the proverbial mirror in 
our faces, record our self-critical 
reactions and play that clusterfuck 
of emotions back to us in a way 
we can make sense of. We need 
someone who gets it.
Brian Sella, vocalist and lyricist 
of The Front Bottoms, gets it. He 
and his bandmates have developed 
a loyal, cult-like following, filled 
with like-minded adolescents who 
swear by Sella’s terrifyingly relat-
able and brutally candid lyrics. 
There’s something unique about 
TFB fans. Finding out someone is 
into them exceeds a shared appre-
ciation for pop-punky, emo rock. 
It confirms that he or she is wired 
the same way and subscribes to a 
similar lifestyle. It confirms that 
that person also gets it. Roughly 
1,000 of those types of people 
flocked to Upstate Concert Hall in 
Clifton Park, N.Y. on Oct. 17 to 
laugh, cry and scream together as 
TFB performed.
But before the titans of the 
evening took the stage, the crowd 
was treated to an eclectic couple 
of opening acts. Neo-shoegaze 
unit Elvis Depressedly kicked off 
the night with some upbeat, rocky 
renditions of their otherwise foggy, 
lo-fi recorded material. Stylisti-
cally, they were the odd band 

out on the tour, but the modified 
versions of their songs supplied 
enough oomph to keep a majority 
of the heads bobbing throughout.  
However, their performance was 
quickly outshone by Australia’s 
The Smith Street Band who went 
absolutely berserk for a full 45 
minutes. Displaying more energy 
onstage than both TFB and Elvis 
Depressedly combined, the folky, 
big-room punk quartet seemed 
to win over most of the room as 
the applause grew exponentially 
throughout the set. 
Although The Smith Street 
Band took home the gold for 
enthusiasm (mainly because their 
songs are faster than TFB’s), the 
crowd’s reaction for the evening’s 
stars was unmatched. Addition-
ally, Sella and Co. were strikingly 
tight musically. Their 20-song set 
list consisted of the near entirety 
of their new album “Back On 
Top,” as well as the obligatory fan 
favorites (“Twin Size Mattress,” 
“Flashlight” and “Skeleton”), back 
catalogue deep cuts (“Tattooed 
Tears,” “Rhode Island” and “Be 
Nice to Me”) and even “Wolfman” 
off of their recent record with rap-
per and companion GDP. 
Obviously, the band had been 
dying for a chance to play new 
material after steadily touring on 
2013’s “Talon of the Hawk” since 
its release, but what made the 
songs from “Back On Top” so spe-
cial was that they’re designed for 
the live setting. The fuzzy riffs in 
“Summer Shandy” and “Historic 
Cemeteries,” the infectious chorus-
es of “Laugh Till I Cry” and “West 
Virginia,” and the colossal sing-
alongs in “Plastic Flowers” and 
“The Plan (Fuck Jobs)” were done 
justice by the passionate crowd’s 
response. Even the more laid back, 
summery vibes of “HELP” and 

“Cough It Out” fit nicely alongside 
their older material. 
The most likely intoxicated 
Sella kept his irreverent banter 
between songs relatively short (ex-
cept for his one Blink-182-esque 
quip about wearing women’s 
underwear), as he took the time to 
glance back at his bandmates to 
giggle at inside jokes.  However, 
when he did address the crowd, 
it was to express his gratitude for 
their support and to make note of 
his love and admiration for his 
tour mates and behind-the-scenes 
crew. The band’s easygoing 
onstage demeanor was equivalent 
to how they project themselves in 
their music videos and interviews, 

which added to the authenticity of 
their overall character and made 
their songs that much more love-
able. 
The highlights of the evening 
were when the whole sweaty mass 
was synergistically shouting back 
quintessential lines like, “Hey man 
I Iove you but no fucking way,” 
and “When I am sad, oh god I’m 
sad - but when I’m happy, I am 
happy” at the top of its collective 
lungs. That crowd, which had 
become one entity, was unlike 
an ordinary group of music fans. 
These were people who were 
visibly tearing up, uncontrollably 
smiling, and almost instinctively 
swaying, flailing and jumping to 
the songs that had shaped their 

very identities. 
Is that heavy handed? Are TFB 
really some sort of magical, all-
knowing, all-healing power who 
touch the lives of each pair of ears 
their music graces? Are they the 
solution to late-teen, early twenty-
something angst? Was this concert 
a divine, life-changing experience 
destined for the history books? 
Probably not. But that concert 
demonstrated to all 1,000 attendees 
that they’re all in this awkward, 
stressful, continually intoxicated 
stretch of life together. TFB fosters 
a niche audience that connects with 
their music on an abnormally deep 
level. And that audience and I are 
proud to say we’re creatures of the 
culture that they create.

Streaming titan Netflix is venturing into 
new territory with the release of “Beasts of 
No Nation.”  
The film, which debuted on the service 
on Oct. 16, is the first feature film to ever 
premiere on Netflix alongside a limited 
theatrical release. This new release 
paradigm has raised a lot of eyebrows, and 
generated as much controversy as it has 
excitement over what it means for the future 
of the film exhibition business.  
Traditionally, theaters expected a period 
of at least 90 days between theatrical 
and home media releases.  When Netflix 
announced its plans to debut films on their 
service, major chains like Regal, AMC, 
and others refused to play their films.  For 
audiences however, Netflix’s inaugural 
foray into film distribution sends a strong 
message and hints at an exciting new 
frontier for the ubiquitous entertainment 
service.  
Amplifying all of the conversation 
surrounding the film’s release is the fact 
that “Beasts of No Nation” itself is a 
stunning film - probably one of the best of 
2015. 
Set amid a deliberately vague civil war 
in an unnamed West African nation, the 
film follows Agu, a young boy whose 
peaceful life with his loving family is torn 
away from him by the slow encroachment 
of war.  Separated from everything he has 
known, he is brought into a rebel militia led 
by a charismatic and power-hungry man 
only ever referred to as the “Commandant.”  
From that setup, the film is a slow descent 
into the violence and moral ambiguity of 
being a child soldier, one of the modern 
world’s most heinous truths.  The audience 
is never spared any of the gruesome details, 
from the horror of Agu’s first kill, to the 
indiscriminate murder of civilians on the 
thinnest of pretenses.
The film’s director is Cary Fukunaga, a 
rising auteur talent in recent years, late of 
films like “Sin Nombre” (2009) and “Jane 
Eyre” (2011) whose profile exploded after 
helming the first season of HBO’s “True 
Detective.” As those credits might suggest, 
Fukunaga has never been a filmmaker 
afraid of facing mankind’s dark side, and 
“Beasts of No Nation” is certainly a film 
that requires such creative bravery.  While 
the shocking and often abrupt violence is 
one thing, Fukunaga is also keenly aware 
that such darkness works best when the 
other side is represented.  
The film opens with an extended look at 
Agu’s life before being thrust into the role 
of a soldier. Fukunaga perfectly captures 
the little details and moments of childhood 
fun that makes his life relatable. Agu starts 
the film going around to adults in his town, 
trying to sell them an “imagination TV,” the 

outer shell of a television behind which his 
friends act out everything from soap operas 
to kung-fu movies.  Fukunaga also took on 
the role of director of photography and the 
result is a film with an incredible sense of 
control.  The colors in Fukunaga’s frames, 
both vibrant and earthy, are wonderfully 
rich and give each shot a depth of beauty 
that makes the violence all the more 
horrifying.
Idris Elba is the big name talent being 
pushed in the film’s publicity, and he 
certainly has the showiest role as the 
Commandant.  Elba has proven himself 
to be one of the more charismatic leading 
men in the business today and here that 
magnetism is used in a subversive way, 
creating a character who uses his charisma 
to manipulate young men into becoming 
killers.  However, while Elba might be the 
film’s big movie star, its biggest asset is 
young newcomer Abraham Attah as Agu.  
Like most stand-out child actors before him, 
Attah has a screen presence and a grasp of 
emotion more befitting a performer much 
older than him.  The film follows Agu over 
a very dynamic time in his life, and Attah 
nails each beat, from the joy of childhood, 
to the tortured and broken soul he becomes 
by the end.
Being such a powerful film, “Beasts 
of No Nation” has been a major focus of 
awards season speculation, with particular 
interest in possibly going all the way to 
the 2016 Academy Awards.  Fukunaga 
is a bona fide triple threat in this regard, 
with Oscar buzz for his roles as director, 
writer, and cinematographer for the film.  
Elba is the film’s major player in the acting 
category, considered one of the front-
runners for Best Supporting Actor.  Attah is 
admirably being pushed in the Best Actor 
race, despite being the smaller name, but in 
that field he is considered more of a long 
shot against a field of veterans.  
No matter how many nominations 
the film ultimately garners, the fact that 
it’s being considered gives legitimacy 
to Netfix’s move into original film 
programming.  When the company started 
its venture into original series development, 
their first offering was the forgettable 
“Lilyhammer” and it was not until their 
second series, “House of Cards,” that they 
became major players at the Emmys. 
“Beasts of No Nation” sends a much 
more promising first impression for the 
company’s original film slate, even if their 
next scheduled films do not inspire much 
confidence. The company has a four-
picture deal with Adam Sandler’s Happy 
Madison production company, the first 
of which, “The Ridiculous 6,” debuts on 
Dec. 11.  After that, an ill-advised sequel 
to “Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon” will 
debut in early 2016.

“Hello, it’s me.” 
These are the first lines British singer 
and songwriter Adele sings from her 
much-anticipated comeback song titled 
“Hello” which was released on Oct. 23 
along with its accompanying music video. 
“Hello” marks Adele’s return to music 
after a three-year hiatus.
“Hello” is a haunting and emotional 
ballad with elements of pop and soul that 
lasts almost five minutes. It was officially 
released as the lead single from her 
upcoming album “25,” scheduled to arrive 
on Nov. 20. 
With Adele’s signature powerful 
vocals, the song deals with love, regret, 
nostalgia and past relationships that have 
since failed. Her familiar smoky voice is 
accompanied by the piano and soft drums 
as well as some additional background 
vocals during the last chorus. 
Upon first impression, the mid-tempo 
song sounds similar to her past work like 
“Someone Like You,” but it nonetheless 
marks a new chapter in Adele’s music 
career. “Hello” sounds refined yet raw, 
giving off the impression that Adele 
worked hard with co-writer Greg Kurstin 
to pen it. Rushed work would not have 
been warmly welcomed by her fans, who 
had to wait three years for her return. 
Her long-awaited return has also earned 
her a positive commercial response, as 
the song quickly skyrocketed to the top 
of iTunes, outselling the likes of Justin 
Bieber, Drake and One Direction. Within 
hours of its release, “Hello” also topped 
iTunes internationally in places like the 
United Kingdom, Australia and Russia, 
showing that Adele is still an international 
force to be reckoned with.
Its music video attracted over 27.7 
million views within 24 hours of its release 
on YouTube, breaking Taylor Swift’s 
Vevo record for the most views for a 

single video within such a timeframe. 
The “Hello” video also reached over 
100 million views in just five days, the 
quickest on record for Vevo, and it has 
been viewed over 133 million times as of 
Oct. 29.
The sepia toned music video was 
directed by Xavier Dolan and was the 
first music video filmed with IMAX 
cameras, which can capture footage with 
a much higher resolution. Also featuring 
American actor Tristan Wilds as Adele’s 
past lover, Adele is shown making a call 
with her flip phone—an obvious sign that 
her relationship with Wilds’ character 
happened in the past—while sadly 
roaming around a petite house. 
The song’s release was preceded by a 
typed letter that Adele had published to the 
public through her Facebook and Twitter 
accounts on Oct. 21 in which she discusses 
how her upcoming album, “25,” will be a 
“make-up record”, unlike “21” which was 
a “break-up record.” While “21” dealt with 
her separation from her past lover, Adele 
wrote that “25” will instead deal with how 
she personally misses her past and how 
she regrets not having done certain things, 
like savoring her childhood. She also 
apologized in her letter to her fans about 
her three-year hiatus.
Between her two album releases, 
Adele became a mother, underwent throat 
surgery, experienced writer’s block, 
and won multiple times during the 2012 
Grammy Awards. 
Today, the big question among Adele’s 
fans is no longer when will she return from 
her three-year hiatus - it is now whether 
Adele’s upcoming album “25” can match 
the massive success that “21” had back in 
2011. Since “Hello” has been positively 
received by fans and music critics alike, as 
well as made a large commercial impact 
on the Hot 100, Adele’s music career 
seems to be steadily headed toward the 
right direction.

The University at Albany hosted the Eastern New 
York Chapter National Association of Teachers of 
Singing (ENY/NATS) in celebration of the Art Song 
Festival. The NATS is a series of competitions and 
programs which are celebrated across the United States, 
divided into regions. The three-day event began on 
Friday, Oct. 23. 
The first day was full of rehearsals in preparation for 
the individual voice performances on Sunday. Students 
and adults both from the university and outside of it 
performed. 
Saturday was the heart of the weekend. There was 
one-on-one coaching with singer/voice-instructor Jeffrey 
McEvoy for each individual. Michael Clement and Todd 
Sisley were featured pianists.
“[I] love to sing but learning to perform is something 
else entirely,” said Lisa Burianek who sang “Sephestia’s 
Lullaby (Britten).” “It’s very scary to be out of one’s 
comfort zone. This event helps all of us, students and 
adults.” 
The voice professor of the music department, 
Frances Wittmann, had most of her voice students 
from both UAlbany and her own studio participate and 
perform. They sung a collection of art songs in different 
languages including French, Italian, and German.
“What a wonderful opportunity to be in a beautiful 
auditorium and with expert coaching,” Robert Willard, a 
senior student who sang an Italian piece, said.
Overall the event left both students and aspiring 
singers with some valuable experience.

“Have you met Henry yet?”, a girl in 
Professor Wulff’s Fall 2013 nutrition class 
asked her friend.
“Who?”
“My hedgehog, Henry.” The two 
laughed. The girl told funny stories about 
Henry the hedgehog - how he curled up in a 
ball in her hand, how he slept in the pockets 
of her hoodies, and how much he loved 
treats.
“What happens if your RA finds out,” the 
friend asked.
The girl shrugged.
“My roommate is the RA. She loves 
him.”
Tropical fish are the only types of pets 
allowed in dorms, according to the Depart-
ment of Residential Life Terms and Condi-
tions of the University Residence Halls. But 
that doesn’t stop many students, including 
Resident Assistants (RAs), from purchas-

ing other kinds of pets to live in their rooms 
with them.
Many students who spoke to the ASP 
on the condition of anonymity admitted to 
having pets like rabbits, hamsters, gerbils, 
guinea pigs, hedgehogs, and cats while on 
campus. One student even reported owning 
a dog.
When a student is found to be in posses-
sion of an animal other than a tropical fish, 
it is up to the Department of Residential 
Life to make sure the student gets rid of the 
creature.
“The [RA will] tell them to remove them 
if they’re not legal,” a ResLife spokesper-
son said. “They have 24 hours.”
RAs are not allowed to comment on this 
topic. 
The Mohawk & Hudson River Humane 
Society adopted out 3,600 pets last year, but 
they will not allow college students living 
on campus to adopt.
Michael Buckley, the director of devel-

opment, says they have not historically 
seen a lot of animals being surrendered by 
students who could not keep them in their 
dorms.
“If someone says they live in a dorm 
in UAlbany, we will not adopt to them,” 
Buckley said. “Certainly, there are good 
pets for college students as long as you live 
in an environment that can have one. One 
of the residence halls is not a good environ-
ment.”
However, this does not always stop 
students from adopting new pets. Some stu-
dents will lie about their address, or use the 
address of a friend who lives off campus.
Students who do not live on campus 
adopt pets as well.
“If students live off campus, it’s hard 
because they give us their address and it’s 
hard to know if they’re a student or not,” 
Buckley said.
Whether or not a student lives on cam-
pus, taking care of a pet is a difficult feat.

Avita Tarachand, a senior at UAlbany, 
has lived off campus for the last two years. 
She adopted a Yorkie a year and a half ago.
“It’s very hard. I feel bad sometimes,” 
Tarachand said. “I wish I could take him 
outside more. When I’m not home my 
housemates are there but they don’t really 
play with him so it’s sad.”
Buckley stressed that adopting a pet is 
not a decision that should be taken lightly. 
“It takes a lot of work. It’s a big commit-
ment. It’s a big financial commitment and 
it’s a big time commitment,” he said.
This is true for almost every animal, 
regardless of how easy it may seem to take 
care of one. For example, many people say 
cats are low maintenance, but Buckley said 
that is not the case.
“I don’t think people oftentimes, no 
matter what age they are, realize how much 
work having an animal can be,” Buckley 
said. “Get a fish if you do decide to get an 
animal.”

or “ze, hir, 
hirs.” 
Call-
ing some-
one who 
identifies as female “he” not only insults 
and diminishes her, but also, according to 
D’Allaird, distracts her from class, causes 
stress, and can have adverse academic ef-
fects.
The university has policies that let stu-
dents indicate a preferred name, according 
to Karl Luntta, UAlbany spokesman, and 
photos of students now accompany their 
names on rosters, D’Allaird said. How-
ever, UAlbany’s data management system, 
Peoplesoft, which collects students’ infor-
mation, doesn’t include information about 
preferred pronouns. 
“At this time we aren’t contemplating a 
change in gender pronouns in the registra-
tion process,” Luntta said. 
Kim, the president of Pride Alliance and 
a staff member at the GSRC said that UAl-
bany should be doing something to change 
that. “It’s a must for our registration,” she 
said.
A must, but registration forms are only 
the first step, Kim said. “I think it should 
just be a daily thing, like ‘Hey what’s your 
name? What’re your preferred pronouns?’” 
she said.
Vik Strutinskaya, vice president of Pride 
Alliance and a staff member at the GSRC, 
agreed. While for some people pronouns 
might not matter, for “someone who is con-
stantly misgendered, having that little box 
in the registration form to say ‘These are 
my pronouns,’ that could mean the world to 
them,” she said.
If there was a place for students to 
mark their preferred pronouns, “then you 
wouldn’t have to ask or wonder. You would 
just be able to see… I’ve never thought that 
more choice is a problem,” D’Allaird said. 
Research shows that the professor often 
sets the tone for inclusion in a classroom, 
followed by the other students, and it’s the 
same for exclusion, D’Allaird said. “If a 
teacher openly refuses to correctly gender 
someone… that sets a tone for the rest of 
the students as to whether or not they will 
respect the student.”

D’Allaird said that recent Title IX 
changes cover transgender people under 
anti-discrimination policies, including that 
a transgender student doesn’t have to suffer 
a hostile class environment. A professor ad-
dressing a student with the wrong pronoun is 
creating a hostile environment. 
Strutinskaya said that she hears from 
students who encounter two types of profes-
sors. One makes an effort to use the correct 
pronouns and truly tries to learn. The other 
doesn’t much care.
“It’s been a thing where the professor 
doesn’t acknowledge it and is like, ‘I know 
that these aren’t the pronouns you like to 
use, but I’m using these anyways because 
that’s what I want to use and that’s how I 
think you should identify,’” she said.
Luntta said that there is no clear or set 
answer for what happens if students are 
faced with a professor who refuses to use 
their preferred pronouns.  This is dealt with 
on a case by case basis. 
“If the student has a problem with 
anything a professor says, there are a series 
of steps they can take. Essentially that is, 
go to the professor first, then your advisor, 
the chair of the department, the dean of 
the school… It’s a succession of faculty or 
administration officers who would be able 
to help resolve the situation for the student,” 
he said. 
Mount Holyoke College, a women’s 
college, began accepting any student who 
“identifies as a woman” in 2014, including 
people born as men who identify as women. 
Dean of Students Marcella Runell Hall, who 
has worked in higher education for 15 years, 
said, “As the national conversation on the 
issues of gender identity continues, people 
of all ages likely will feel more comfortable 
identifying outside of the gender binary, 
and personal pronouns will be a small 
but important part of that conversation. 
Colleges and universities and the nation as 
a whole must continue the discussion about 
how to share information about personal 
pronouns in order to offer more inclusive 
environments.”
On Campus Pride Index, a tool that ranks 
campuses on LGBTQ-inclusiveness and 
helps schools find ways to improve, UAlba-
ny has a 3.5 out of 5 star-rating. Its highest 

score was LGBTQ student life with 4.5 stars 
and its lowest was LGBTQ academic life 
with 2.5 stars. Not every school is in CPI - 
for example, Saint Rose College and Siena 
College are missing.
UAlbany is also one of 150 schools in the 
country that D’Allaird knows of to have a 
GSRC.
CPI has a list called “LGBTQ policy in-
clusion,” which tells what the school does in 
its policies to be inclusive. Two areas where 
UAlbany is lacking are: the ability to self-
identify sexual orientation on application or 
post-enrollment forms, and the ability to do 
the same with gender identity.
However, the SUNY system is work-
ing on fixing this. In September the SUNY 
Board of Trustees approved a more inclu-
sive policy, as well as a new data collection 
tool. With this new tool, all SUNY students 

could choose to self-identify their gender 
identity, sexual orientation, and additional 
statuses (such as veteran status). Accord-
ing to Casey Vattimo, director of public 
relations for SUNY, the next step is for each 
SUNY school to create a plan to put the new 
policy and data collection into effect.
“I think creating more space for people 
to identify does two things,” said D’Allaird. 
“One: If you do identify as such, you have 
a space to claim… Two: It exposes people 
who have no idea that pronouns even exist, 
even though they are using pronouns… but 
never have to think about it.”
Kim, who holds events often as presi-
dent of Pride Alliance, introduces herself 
with her name and her pronouns. Adding 
an option to identify pronouns would make 
more people aware of the issue and stop the 
confusion she’s often faced with, Kim said.

fields will make his goal 
possible. Jones also 
referenced a plan from 
the provost to increase 
retention by 10 percent. 
“Retention is absolutely 
critical to our enrollment 
goals. This is where we 
can make a big difference 
in our numbers,” he said. 
Jones stated that $8.8 
million would be spent 
on new investments 
for 2016-17, with 
more than half of the 
funding going toward 
academics. Future goals 
include the creation of a 
UAlbany B.S. program 
in computer engineering 
and a new Advanced 
Data Analytics Institute. 
Jones also highlighted 
a desire to grow health 
sciences and biomedical 
research. He stressed that 
he wanted to continue 
funding the humanities 
as well and announced 
the development of the 
Institute for History and 
Public Engagement. 

“This will 
be fertile 
ground for 
collaboration 
across 
disciplines, to attract 
grants, host colloquia, 
and develop experiential 
learning programs,” he 
said. 
Jones also announced 
the investment of $2 
million in the College of 
Engineering and Applied 
Sciences, an initial 
investment of $400,000 
for contingent faculty pay, 
and $250,000 for graduate 
student stipends. Jones 
also intends to expand 
the university’s EOP 
program and has applied 
for a SUNY grant that 
he expects will grow the 
program by 30 percent.
 “As the allocation of 
state resources to SUNY 
has declined, more and 
more we find ourselves 
in fierce competition for 
public funds,” Jones said, 
“So more than ever, we 
have to be targeted in our 
requests and we have to 
continually show a return 
on investment.”

The University at Albany 
Women’s Basketball Record 
Book might as well be called the 
Shereesha Richards Book. 
In just three years at the school, 
Richards has dominated on the 
court for the Great Danes and 
climbed into the top 10 of nearly 
every major program record. 
She is currently the program’s 
all-time points leader, and she 
still has a season left to rewrite 
the record that former teammate 
Ebone Henry set in a historic four-

year career. 
Henry’s number five now 
hangs in the SEFCU Arena rafters, 
and it’s all but certain Richards’ 
number 25 will be there shortly 
after her graduation. 
For now, Richards is focused on 
her senior season at UAlbany, and 
she intends to make it a great one. 
“We definitely want to win and 
continue the tradition of winning,” 
Richards said. “We’re looking 
forward to having a great year 
overall and getting back to the 
[NCAA] Tournament and winning 
a game, making it to the second 

round.” 
UAlbany Coach Katie 
Abrahamson-Henderson lets the 
team’s seniors dictate what the 
team’s goals are going to be. This 
year, Richards and fellow senior 
Erin Coughlin are going to be the 
team’s leaders on and off the court. 
Knowing it is her last go around 
with the Danes probably won’t 
bother Richards.  
“There’s no added pressure 
because I know I’m always going 
to have the target on my back,” 
Richards said. “As a player being 
out on the court I’m always going 

to be pressured so I can’t 
be focusing on that.” 
Over the past four 
seasons, the UAlbany 
women’s basketball 
program has turned into a 
juggernaut, winning four 
straight America East 
titles to reach the NCAA 
Tournament. Richards 
was a part of the last 
three championship 
teams, and the chance to 
earn a fourth in a row is 
one she will relish. 
“It would be great 
to be a part of this 
and it would mean 
we were able to 
continue the tradition 
of succeeding for the 
program,” Richards said 
of a potential fourth 
championship in a row. 
While Richards and 
the Danes have taken 
home a lot of hardware, 
one thing still eludes 
them - an NCAA 
Tournament victory. 
Last season was the 
closest UAlbany got to 
success on the national 
stage. In a tough, hard 
fought battle at Cameron 
Indoor Stadium in 
March, the Duke Blue 
Devils escaped with a 54-
52 victory over UAlbany 
in the first round of the 
NCAA Tournament. 
The loss was a tough 
one to get over, but it will serve as 
motivation for UAlbany heading 
into the upcoming season. 
“It’s always something that’s 
right there. It’s like that bug that is 
buzzing in your ear and you can’t 
get rid of it. It’s always going to be 
there and it’s always going to be 
heartbreak,” Richards said. “You 
wish that you could have won the 
game but at the same time you 
have to move on, you can’t dwell 
on the past.” 
Over her career, Richards’s 
stats are mind-boggling. She 
boasts the two highest scoring 

seasons in program history. She 
is the only Great Dane to score 
40 points in a single game, and 
she has also scored 20 or more 
points in a game an astounding 
37 times, the equivalent of a full 
season. Her rebounding numbers 
are almost as good, topped only 
by former teammate Julie Forster, 
whose number 11 also hangs in the 
SEFCU Arena rafters.
However, what may be her most 
important asset can’t be judged in 
a stat sheet or record book.
“Just seeing her work ethic, she 
comes in every day working, she’s 
getting better,” Coughlin said. 
“She’s becoming more of a vocal 
leader this year too, which is big 
for her because she has so much 
respect from her teammates just 
from her talent alone.” 
That talent has led Richards to 
two straight America East Player 
of the Year awards after a Rookie 
of the Year award her freshman 
year. Richards has come a long 
way from playing netball in her 
home, Jamaica. In fact, she didn’t 
even play basketball at all until she 
came to America for high school. 
“She’s developed so much more 
when she got here,” said teammate 
Imani Tate. “Everything that she 
does now as a basketball player 
is completely different since her 
freshman year or even before 
that.” 
“She can lead with her actions 
and now with her voice, that’s 
big,” Coughlin said. 
Richards has rarely been 
stopped in her career, and that job 
falls to scout players in practice. 
Since few coaches have the answer 
on how to stop her, it begs the 
question, could Richards guard 
herself if given the opportunity? 
“That’s a good question. I really 
don’t even know how I could 
guard myself. I don’t really think 
I could, unless I really wanted 
to guard myself. I think it would 
be really hard to guard myself,” 
Richards said. 
The first test for UAlbany will 
be on Sunday, Nov. 15, against 
Pepperdine at SEFCU Arena at 1

Richards is now UAlbany’s All-Time leading scorer.

By SHANE MARSHALL 

If Peter Hooley has a limited shot range, he doesn’t know 
it. Either that or University at Albany men’s basketball coach 
Will Brown hasn’t addressed it. 
Whether the fifth-year senior guard has “Jimmer-range” is 
another story. 
“The [shot] in the Oklahoma game was pretty deep,” 
Hooley said. “Let me test that theory and get back to you, 
we’ll figure it out.”
One thing Hooley has figured out is how to hit the big shot 
when UAlbany needs it. After all, he hit the game-winning 
3-pointer with 1.6 seconds left, the Great Danes’ only 
triple, to knock off Stony Brook 51-50 in the America East 
Tournament to send UAlbany to the NCAA Tournament for 
the third-straight season. 
Then there was the first-half shot against Oklahoma to 
bring the Danes within two of the Sooners with 8:56 until 
halftime. UAlbany would lose 69-60, but Hooley provided a 
lot of energy all season. 
“When our backs are against the wall we can all bond 
together,” Hooley said. “The strongest part about UAlbany 
basketball is we’re a family together. There’s going to be 
times when our backs are against the wall and we’ve got to 
make sure we come together.”
Now the page has been turned. It’s a new chapter for 

Hooley and Co., and it’s not an 
easier one by any means. They 
open with No. 1-ranked Kentucky 
on Nov. 13. 
“I’m always more confident 
playing the higher level teams 
later in the year,” Brown said.  “I 
think that our teams, especially 
recently, have really gotten better 
as the year has gone on.”
UAlbany returns four starters 
from last season with Sam 
Rowley being the lone loss from 
last year’s roster. Rowley was an 
all-conference first-teamer and led 
the Great Danes in scoring. 
Returning with Hooley on the 
perimeter are Evan Singletary and 
Ray Sanders. Both transferred to 
UAlbany from junior colleges last 
season and played crucial minutes 
for the Great Danes en route to the 
Big Dance. 
Sanders was recently named 
a captain along with Hooley and 
senior walk-on Reece Williams. 
In the frontcourt, Richard Peters, 
Greig Stire and Mike Rowley all 
return from last year’s team. The one 
called upon to fill the middle will be 
based on production.
“We just need to get some offensive production on a 
nightly basis,” Brown said of his big men. “Those guys can all 
defend, rebound and help us win, they just have to contribute 
offensively.”
The Great Danes added depth this season with junior 
college transfers and freshmen recruits. 
Travis Charles, a 6-foot-6 junior forward from Brooklyn, 
has shown the most talent on the offensive end. Charles 
transferred from Howard College. 
Freshmen Kyle McKinley and Joe Cremo could provide 
solid minutes for UAlbany.
McKinley is a 6-foot-10 forward from Stillwater, Minn. 
Guard Reece Williams says he’s the biggest guy on the team 
since John Puk graduated in 2011. Cremo is a 6-foot-4 guard 
from nearby Scotia, who is regarded by teammates as a gym 
rat.
Both have helped add depth to a UAlbany roster that has 
added size for the upcoming season. 
“I do think there is more talent and more depth on this 

team than there was a year ago,” Brown said. “But, you can 
only play five guys at a time. I do think we’re loaded on the 
perimeter, and we have a bunch of big bodies up front. It all 
comes down to production.”
Brown says the Great Danes will have to be strong in 
transition defense, limit turnovers, and force the Wildcats to 
be a jump-shooting team in order to leave Lexington with a 
win in the season opener. It’s a matchup that is bringing a lot 
of motivation to UAlbany. 
“I’ve been thinking about Kentucky since I found out we 
were playing them in the summer,” Williams said. “I remind 
the guys when we do drills. I might say ‘Isaiah Briscoe‘ who 
is one of the guys who may start, or play a lot of minutes 
against us.”
Along with Williams, Hooley has the chance to become 
one of the first players in UAlbany history to make the NCAA 
Tournament four times. 
“This is it for him,” Brown said. “His last go around. I want 
to make sure three is not good enough for him. Complacency 
kills and we can’t afford to become complacent. The minute 
we do, that’s when we’re going to struggle.”
