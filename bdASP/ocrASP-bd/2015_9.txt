There were capes galore at the 5K race this past 
Sunday at UAlbany. The sprint raises money for the 
Starlight Children’s Foundation, which helps support 
sick children and their families.

The Superhero Sprint

By LINDSEY RIBACK

Money, media and politics were on the minds of the 
students and faculty members who attended Professor 
Rosemary Armao’s discussion Wednesday in the Standish 
Room. This was the second of the University at Albany 
Libraries’ “Campus Conversations in Standish” series, which 
began last spring. 
The purpose of the series is to “showcase faculty research 
and expertise” and to foster conversations on different topics 
among members of the UAlbany community, according to the 
UAlbany Library website.
Armao, who is the director of the UAlbany journalism 
program and a panelist for WAMC Public Radio, began her 
presentation titled “The 2016 Election: What Happens When 
New Money Converges With New Media” by explicitly 
stating her biases and the flaws she sees in media coverage. 
She acknowledged her feminist bias to the 20 or so 
individuals gathered at the table with her, saying that she is 
likely to vote for Hillary Clinton because “I would like to see 
a woman president.” 
Armao also believes that the best presidents are 

professional politicians and the average citizen does not do a 
good job of reporting in general, especially when it comes to 
politics. 
The problem with the current media, Armao explained, is 
that political coverage focuses on quirks and personalities.
When media does cover political issues “it is so freaking 
boring that no one reads it, and if they do struggle through it, 
they don’t remember it,” she said. “We still don’t have the 
talent for writing about boring topics in an interesting way.”
Another problem is that presidential candidates have the 
ability to command the coverage they are receiving. Armao 
mentioned the role of money in Republican candidate Donald 
Trump’s campaign. Up until this point all of his interviews 
have been on the balcony of Trump Tower, almost as an 
advertisement of himself and what he has attained over the 
years. 
The media needs to step back and focus on the actual 
politics rather than on the sensationalism, Armao said. 
“I think media has the responsibility to say, these are the 
serious candidates - let us concentrate our coverage on that,” 
she said. 
When it comes to coverage the media does get a lot right, 
Armao said. She cited an article by The New York Times last 

month which revealed that more than half the money donated 
to the 2016 presidential campaigns comes from only 158 
families. This allows the wealthy, who are putting exorbitant 
amounts of money into individual campaigns, to potentially 
have a large influence on politics. 
The journalism director also said that reporters are doing 
a good job of holding candidates accountable. For example, 
many Republican nominees claim to not believe in the theory 
of evolution and so reporters have brought other professional 
voices to debates this. 
This brings up the question of balance. 
“Does the media have a duty to be balanced in coverage 
if one side is clearly correct?” asked attendee Martha Rozett, 
a professor in the English department. Rozett explained that 
in class if a student presents an answer to a question that is 
clearly incorrect, she tells the student that the answer is wrong 
and doesn’t sugarcoat it. 
Armao explained to her audience that even if reputable 
news sources are not providing the other side, it can be found 
on the internet, although it may be inaccurate. 
According to her, “balanced journalism is a form of 
unfairness.” In well-established sources of media the other 
side should be noted, but not necessarily given equal space.

AMERICAN MEDIA AND POLITICS
What reporters get wrong, and what money has to do with it

By RUSSELL OLIVER

The University at Albany’s 
School of Social Welfare is 
collaborating with the newly 
formed HEARTS (Healthy 
Environments And Relationships 
That Support) Initiative to increase 
research and create programs to 
aid people who have experienced 
early childhood trauma, frequently 
referred to as Adverse Childhood 
Experiences (ACE).
“We want to turn this into a 
social movement, engaging all 
community members and reaching 
policy-makers statewide,” Heather 
Larkin, an associate professor at 
UAlbany, said.
Studies show a strong link 
between ACEs and developing 
financial and social problems 
later in life. Traumatic childhood 
experiences can put stress on a 
developing brain, thus causing 
behavioral troubles, learning 
disabilities, and poor health. ACE 
and its after effects have become a 
huge concern in New York state.
HEARTS agencies researched 
and collected data on ACE from 

schools in the Capital Region. 
LaSalle School discovered that 
40.7 percent of its students are 
suffering from ACE. St. Anne 
Institute had many students 
suffering from ACE in a study 
among 125 girls in their residential 
treatment facility. They found 
that 65 percent have experienced 
physical abuse, 70 percent have 
experienced sexual abuse and 96 
percent reported a family member 
who abused drugs or alcohol.
An outpatient substance abuse 
service named Senior Hope 
scored those 50 and older on their 
ACE. Fifty-four percent of them 
were suffering from ACE-related 
problems in their lives, with higher 
percentages for females. Findings 
have also uncovered the impact 
of ACE on the homeless adult 
community in Albany, with over 
half of those surveyed suffering 
from their ACE. These statistics 
show that the number of people 
suffering from ACE has increased 
in Albany and New York state.
Larkin has been a pioneer in 
research on ACE in this area. 
She has been broadening ACE 
research into programs, practices, 

and policies. The ACE Study, 
conducted by Larkin, was one 
of the largest investigations ever 
performed to notice connections 
between childhood mistreatment 
and later life problems. She 
plans to expand her research into 
disadvantaged groups and to 
emphasize social workers’ ACE 
response within these groups to 
advocate community resilience. 
According to Larkin, agencies 
around the Capital Region are 
improving their services for 
those who are in need the most: 
people with high ACE scores and 
numerous associated health and 
social issues. These agencies ask 
“what’s happened to you” instead 
of “what’s wrong with you.” They 
focus on being compassionate and 
addressing people’s strengths to 
influence improvement.
“We now see how pervasive 
ACEs are in society and how 
we can work together to create a 
culture of health that reduces the 
high human, social, and economic 
costs associated with ACEs,” she 
said.
Larkin said the HEARTS 
Initiative was created based on 

public interest on the matter. The 
original ACE study authors held 
presentations at the university 
starting in 2007, which were 
widely attended. Many attendees 
noted that the ACE characteristics 
mentioned in the presentations 
were noticeable in the community. 
For this reason Larkin started 
holding ACE Think Tank and 
Action team meetings.
“These quarterly events brought 
together community members 
and providers interested in 
translating the ACE research into 
policies, programs, practices, and 
community supports,” Larkin said.
The Think Tank and Action 
meetings soon developed into 
the HEARTS Initiative. Many 
organizations and schools from 
the Capital Region are part of the 
HEARTS Initiative, including the 
Center for Disability Services, 
the Community Hospice, 
Prevent Child Abuse NY, and St. 
Catherine’s Center for Children. 
UAlbany acts as the “backbone” of 
this alliance, according to Larkin.
UAlbany has recently been 
gifted a $300,000 grant to expand 
research and services at the 

HEARTS 
Initiative, 
according 
to a press 
release. 
Larkin 
believes 
that this 
grant will 
help raise 
social 
awareness 
on this 
problem.
“This award significantly 
recognizes the great work being 
done by Dr. Larkin and her team,” 
Darrell P. Wheeler, the dean of the 
School of Social Welfare, said in 
the press release.
The HEARTS Initiative plans 
to utilize this grant by focusing 
on the Capital Region’s highest 
scoring ACE population, including 
people with disabilities, children in 
minority groups, and the homeless.
“We also want to do more 
outreach to schools and 
healthcare,” Larkin said. “We want 
a comprehensive approach where 
we are all working together to 
create a culture of health.”

STUDENT ACTIVISM

By FRANCESCA MCGUIRE

Beny Poy, a junior from the 
Bronx, N.Y., is used to making 
an impact on the University at 
Albany campus. He’s a Resident 
Assistant and Senator for Dutch 
Quad, a member of the campus 
club MAP (Minorities and 
Philosophy) and was the Assistant 
Residential Director for this year’s 
EOP Summer Program. 
However, last month he made 
an impact at UAlbany that will live 
on for years after he graduates. 
Poy helped draft and present a bill 
to the Student Association that 
changed the UAlbany recognition 
of Hispanic Heritage Month, 
celebrated from Sept. 15 to Oct. 
15, to the more inclusive Latino 
Heritage Month.
Last February, Poy and 
Christopher Ortega, the co-sponsor 

of the bill, studied abroad in Cuba 
where they connected to their 
Latin roots. They came back to 
the United States with a renewed 
sense of pride. They began to 
recognize the cultural barrier that 
Hispanic Heritage Month creates.
“In Cuba I learned what it 
means to define yourself and 
the empowerment of certain 
terminology,” Poy said. 
Upon his return, Poy began 
to take various classes in the 
Caribbean and Latin American 
Studies Department at UAlbany. 
The classes offered insight 
regarding what it means to be of 
Hispanic descent versus Latin 
descent. 
He described the use of the 
term Hispanic as an identity for 
those who have heritage coming 
from the Iberian Peninsula, speak 
Spanish, and have Spaniard 
heritage. 

“It generally means those who 
are Puerto Rican, Mexican or 
Dominican,” Poy explained. 
According to Poy, the American 
government uses this identity to 
easily group people together for 
the census. 
The term Latino refers to those 
within the Latin American region. 
“Using Latino is almost like 
an umbrella,” Poy said. “ It’s 
a regional reference that even 
includes Brazilians, for example, 
who are typically excluded from 
the term Hispanic.”  
Poy, who is Dominican and 
Puerto Rican, also maintained 
that Hispanic is considered a 
“top-down terminology,” whereas 
Latino is considered “bottom-up.” 
“Identifying as Latino is a form 
of self-empowerment,” Poy said, 
citing this as something he learned 
in his Latinization of U.S. Cities 
course. 

To change the UAlbany 
recognition of the month, Poy first 
went to the department of Latin 
American and Caribbean studies. 
He quickly received support from 
professors and a letter from the 
department chair, Pedro Cabán. 
He also gained support from 
the director of the Educational 
Opportunities Program, Maritza 
Martinez, and from Fuerza, the 
largest organization on campus 
that celebrates Latino culture. 
After drafting the bill, the 
Office of Intercultural Student 
Engagement, which for the last 
decade has celebrated Latino 
Heritage Month instead of 
Hispanic Heritage Month, backed 
Poy.
To Poy’s relief, the bill passed 
unanimously. However, there was 
one amendment.
“The bill was slightly changed 
to be inclusive to Latinas as well,” 

Poy said. “Simply because the 
word Latino is more specific to 
males.”
Hispanic Heritage Month will 
now be celebrated as Latino and 
Latina Heritage Month, to include 
both women and men of Latin 
descent.
Although Poy celebrated the 
bill being passed on the UAlbany 
campus, he sees it as simply the 
first step in changing federal 
recognition of an important 
month. He and Ortega hope to 
spread the change to the entire 
SUNY system, New York state, 
and maybe one day the federal 
government. 
Next year will be Poy’s senior 
year at UAlbany, and he has a lot 
to look forward to in the month 
celebrating his heritage.
“I hope to see a lot more 
diversity in the Latin culture that is 
celebrated,” he said.

W

hat is now known as the 
“Spring Valley Incident” 
happened on Monday, Oct. 
26. A 16-year-old student was refusing 
to give her phone away to her teacher, 
thus disrupting the class. Deputy Ben 
Fields, the school’s resource officer, was 
called into the classroom to remove the 
girl from the class and he overreacted to 
the extreme. At least three videos were 
taken of the event and became viral 
globally after they were posted online. 
   Fields’ attorney, Scott J. Hayes, has 
spoken out about the officer’s actions in 
the Spring Valley incident, defending 
Fields in a press release statement he 
posted last Wednesday. 
   “We believed that Mr. Fields’ actions 
were justified and lawful throughout 
the circumstances of which he was 
confronted during this incident,” he said 
in the release.
   I have one question for Mr. Hayes: Do 
you have eyes? Because the videos that 
went viral show Fields flipping the girl’s 
chair to the ground with her in it, before 

pulling her out of her chair and across 
the room.
   Hayes then continues to say, “To 
that extent, we believe that Mr. Fields’ 
actions were carried out professionally 
and that he was performing his job 
duties within the legal threshold.”
   Again, are you sure you can see Mr. 
Hayes? I don’t think anyone who saw 
these videos would deem Fields’ actions 
as “professional.” Also, I wouldn’t 
consider dragging a student-aged girl 
across the ground within the “legal 
threshold.”
   Leon Lott, the Richard County Sheriff, 
suspended Fields immediately after 
the incident. Fields was fired two days 
after that. However, the sheriff wasn’t 
completely on the student’s side.
   Lott believes that the student has 
some accountability in the situation 
because her  disruptive behavior is what 
caused Fields to enter the classroom and 
remove her. 
   “When a classroom is disrupted by 
a student, that disrupts the education 
process and the students can’t learn and 
the teachers can’t teach,” Lott said in a 
recent CNN article.

   Hey Sheriff Lott, do you know what 
also disrupts classrooms? A violent 
police officer dragging a student across 
the room. It amazes me that so many 
people are trying to focus a portion 
of the blame on the student, when 
Fields overreacted to the situation 
tremendously.
   Don’t even get me started on Raven-
Symoné. Haven’t you already said 
enough controversial things for a 
relatively new host on “The View?” 
   “The girl was told multiple times to 
get off the phone,” Raven said during 
the roundtable discussion. “There’s no 
right or reason for him to be doing this 
type of harm, that’s ridiculous. But at 
the same time, you gotta follow the rules 
in school. First of all, why are there cell 
phones in school? This shouldn’t even 
be a problem to begin with.”
   You know, you’re right Raven. The 
real lesson from this incident is that cell 
phones shouldn’t be in school. That’s so 
not right, Raven.
   The girl from the incident was arrested 
afterwards for “disturbing schools.” 
Niya Kenny, 18, was also arrested in 
class that day for the same charges. She 

spoke out to CNN about the incident. 
Kenny said that she told her classmates 
to get their phones out because they 
knew of the officer’s reputation. 
Kenny’s attorney, Simone Martin, said 
that a number of students refer to him 
as “Officer Slam as opposed to Officer 
Fields.”
   Kenny later described Fields as a 
“dangerous man to get involved with” 
in the interview. It seems like this guy 
has a history of violence. The fact that 
he is the resource officer for this school 
is scary. 
   Let me just be the one to say it: Ben 
Fields,  you’re an asshole.
   The fact is that communities aren’t 
taking police brutality seriously enough. 
There have been way too many reports 
of police officers taking it way too far 
and using brutal force or even gunfire 
in situations where it’s unnecessary. 
We need to address this issue because I 
think that the more stories we hear, the 
more fear we feel about the police force 
as a whole. They are the ones that are 
supposed to be protecting us, not the 
ones we need protecting from.

ACADEMICS
‘Unbundling’ higher education at UAlbany

By PATRICK GAREAU
T

he ground is shifting beneath 
institutions of higher education, and 
not just because of tractors moving 
dirt around the podium at the University 
at Albany. Innovative organizations 
are increasingly putting pressure on 
traditional colleges and universities to 
change the way they deliver education to 
students.
   I had the opportunity to attend the 
annual SUNY Critical Issues in Higher 
Education Conference on Oct. 29 and 
Oct. 30. The event felt like a reckoning 
or an identity crisis for schools in the 
SUNY system. As I listened to a number 
of experts in higher education discuss the 
disruptive forces at play and the trends 
in the sector, I found myself wondering 
where UAlbany will fit in this changing 
landscape.
   One of the developments changing 
education is the availability of free online 
courses from top global universities 
through online platforms like EdX. Anant 
Agarwal, CEO of EdX, participated in a 
panel at the event. 
   “Higher ed. needs to reinvent itself,” he 

said.
   Agarwal suggested that each college 
and university focus on what they do well, 
and allow students to receive credit for 
subjects outside of a given institution’s 
specialty through free online platforms. At 
a comprehensive university like UAlbany, 
this suggestion may not be as relevant as 
a specialized liberal arts school or tech 
school. However, it does call attention to 
the power of improving online learning 
platforms and the lack of online course 
offerings at UAlbany.
   As a new student this semester with a 
busy schedule who could really benefit 
from being able to take a couple of classes 
online, I was absolutely baffled by the 
void of offerings when signing up for 
courses. I had assumed when coming here 
that, since this is a large university and 
it’s the 21st century, it must be making an 
effort to offer a lot of online courses. Then 
when trying to cross register an online 
course through Empire State College, 
my department said it would not apply to 
my major even though the course had the 
same title as the one offered here.
   UAlbany has to focus on developing 
its online course offerings or risk being 

outcompeted by others that have gotten 
off to a head start. At the very least, if the 
university does not want to develop their 
own online course material, they need to 
make it easier for students to take courses 
elsewhere.
   Another topic that was much discussed 
during the conference was a concept 
called “unbundling.” This is where parts 
of what are included in a traditional 
degree are offered separately instead of 
keeping everything bundled in an one-
degree program. This often takes the form 
of offering certificates for certain skills. 
SUNY Chancellor Nancy Zimpher said 
the system needs to start thinking about 
unbundling. She announced the creation 
of a task force on micro-credentialing 
during the conference to address this.
   Like with online offerings, UAlbany 
could do better to keep pace with this 
trend in higher education. While a number 
of graduate certificates are offered, the 
university should start moving quicker 
on offering certificates that can be earned 
in the process of obtaining a bachelor’s 
degree.
   While our university is lagging behind 
in the areas mentioned above, UAlbany is 

doing better than most in some areas that 
were often discussed at the conference, 
such as forming partnerships with other 
local colleges (like the recent partnership 
announcement with Albany Law), 
working closely with businesses (such 
as Start-Up NY) and expanding applied 
learning opportunities.
   However, as a lifetime resident of 
the Capital Region, I would like to see 
UAlbany be an aggressive innovator in 
higher education so that it can continue 
to be a positive driving force in the 
community. It is probably too late to see it 
happen while I am a student, but UAlbany 
can certainly become a leader in cutting 
edge practices if that is made a priority in 
the next five years.
   At the conference, Facebook co-founder 
and publisher of “The Atlantic,” Chris 
Hughes, said he believes higher education 
is heading toward a crisis point. Many 
experts in attendance shared that sentiment. 
UAlbany has to start reevaluating how they 
operate in many areas in order to make sure 
that the university not only survives these 
disruptions, but also thrives in a new higher 
education environment.

veryone has a different sense of style. But are all 
these possibilities acknowledged by the public? 
   No, they’re not. There are established styles, 
but there are some that we tend to disregard and treat as 
abnormal and inferior. 
   Clothing is a norm that society has warped into 
gender-specific attire which we are expected to follow. 
The styles we disregard are those that don’t follow 
gender expectations. 
   Men and women are expected to dress in certain 
ways, but that doesn’t have to be the case. In fact, as the 
continuum of sexuality and gender begins to unravel, we 
see that people can wear whatever they want, and they 
do so flawlessly. We wear the clothes - the clothes don’t 
wear us. 
   These pieces of fabric have so much power to define 
people, but they shouldn’t. Clothes are made as a form 
of expression— they aren’t the absolute definition of a 
person. There is more to that person than his or her shirt 
or shoes. 
   Fashion Week is a time when what is considered to 
be the epitome of style goes on display. But the well-
known, glamorous fashion undermines alternative 
apparel. There is nothing wrong with the celebration of 
upcoming trends, but it’s troubling that it’s seen as the 
role model of human attire. While Fashion Week isn’t 
blatantly forcing its fashion onto its audience or the 
world, it’s claiming to portray what the highest form of 
fashion is. 
   There’s nothing wrong with Fashion Week, but there 
are styles outside of what walks the catwalks during 
those weeks. And I’m glad that fashion week is slowly 
introducing other styles, and gender fluidity, to the 
runway show. 
   Fashion Week is in the process of stepping into a better 
direction, as it’s beginning to mesh masculinity and 
femininity onto either sex. Yet they aren’t taking it to the 
extent they could be in this modern day and age.
   Thus, I bring attention to The MarcoMarco show. 
Although it’s just a not-so-popular underwear brand, 
the creator hosts runway shows that exploit gender 
fluidity and sexuality in a complementary spotlight. The 
MarcoMarco show’s significance lies behind the models 
wearing the clothes. 
   The models are transgender, drag queens, and people 

who fall on the spectrum of homosexuality. I love this. 
I love the fact that this runway show went outside of 
the box, and didn’t focus on what people were wearing 
(although the clothes were stunning, too). It focuses 
more on the model and the impact they have on the 
attire. 
   MarcoMarco really takes this style of 
“genderfuckness” and shows how it can be beautiful. 
After all, gender is something we have control over. And 

just to make it clear, “genderfuckness” shouldn’t have a 
negative connotation: it’s a statement that clarifies that 
there is no certain way one gender should look. And 
unlike other runway presentations, MarcoMarco doesn’t 
ignore that people come in all different shapes and sizes. 
   His progressive step toward diversity is sending 
out a message that society needs to act on. This show 
eliminates the standard of beauty and allows people to 
define beauty as they please.

By DIEGO CAGARA

Award-winning Hollywood 
actor, director and screenwriter 
Edward Burns got low grades and 
almost couldn’t graduate when he 
went to the University at Albany 
back in the late 1980s.
“I was spending too much 
time downtown and not enough 
time on campus and my grades 
reflected on that,” he said. “I was 
called in…to have a talk with [my 
adviser] because my GPA was 
like a 1.8.”
Burns, 47, returned to 
UAlbany for a seminar on Nov. 
6 to reminisce about his days 
here, speak about his journey 
to the Hollywood scene, and 
also promote his new memoir 
“Independent Ed,” which is 
like a how-to guide for aspiring 
film students that details his 
experiences as a filmmaker. The 
Writers Institute coordinated his 
stay, and his appearance was free 
and open to the public.
As the seminar began, Burns 
recalled how his academic adviser 
recommended he minor in film 

studies to complement his English 
major and boost his failing grades. 
Burns also struggled financially, 
as his father could not afford to 
help him transfer to New York 
University, where he’d dreamed 
of going, after taking all the 
relevant courses at UAlbany. This 
led Burns to eventually transfer to 
Hunter College instead, where he 
was able to take more film-related 
courses.
 An assignment Burns had 
while at Hunter College  pushed 
him to try his hand at acting as 
well.
“My professor asked the class 
if [anyone wanted] to be directors 
and all of us raised our hands,” 
Burns recalled. “He then said, 
‘How many of you have any 
acting experience?’ and nobody 
raised their hands. He then said 
‘How would you know how to 
work with actors if you’ve never 
spent one second in their shoes?’”
The professor assigned Burns 
to act out a scene with several 
classmates. Burns said he was 
initially “terrified” but then “fell 
in love with” acting. This laid 

the foundation for his career as 
an actor later on, in addition to 
his passion for screenwriting and 
directing. Burns would eventually 
get cast in successful films like 
“She’s the One” (1996) and “The 
Holiday” (2006).
During college, Burns looked 
up to veteran directors like Steven 
Spielberg, Martin Scorsese and 
Woody Allen for inspiration. After 
collaborating with Spielberg, who 
directed “Saving Private Ryan” 
(1998), Burns learned something 
from him about being a great 
director.
Burns recalled how Spielberg 
did not give much direction to 
him and his co-stars during the 
first two weeks of shooting. This 
convinced them that “[Spielberg] 
hated our performances and was 
eventually going to fire us.” But 
on the 11th day of shooting, 
Spielberg began actively directing 
them by filming more takes. 
Burns then approached him to ask 
why he had not done so from the 
beginning.
“Spielberg explained that his 
approach when handling actors 

was to hire actors who he knew 
could already do the job, and 
he liked their past work but 
he didn’t want to step on their 
toes which would have created 
creative differences,” Burns said. 
“Only when [Spielberg] sees that 
the actors go way off in a crazy 
direction, then he has to step in. 
But other than that, he knows how 
professional actors are and they 
don’t need his help.”
Burns would use this approach 
as a director. He collaborated with 
Spielberg again, who is a co-
producer of the TNT police drama 
series “Public Morals” (2015), 
which Burns created, wrote, 
directed and starred in. 
Inspired by his father and uncle 
who are retired New York City 
policemen, Burns told Spielberg 
about his fascination with “what it 
was like to be a cop in New York 
in the ‘50s, ‘60s and ‘70s” while 
filming “Saving Private Ryan.” 
Spielberg then encouraged him to 
create a film about it. 
Over a decade later, TNT would 
approach Burns in 2015 about 
creating a new TV series for its 

network about either “gangsters, 
cops or zombies.” Realizing 
that this could be his chance to 
create the period cop drama like 
he’d envisioned, Burns pitched 
his concept to TNT, which then 
ordered 10 episodes to air. Its pilot 
broadcast on Aug. 25.
In addition to his free seminar, 
Burns travelled to UAlbany’s 
Downtown Campus to screen two 
episodes of “Public Morals” for 
free. 
Despite his successes and 
failures over the years, as well 
as how many times he and his 
pitches were initially rejected by 
distribution companies, agencies 
and film festivals, Burns attributed 
his climb to Hollywood fame to 
both his constantly supportive 
father and his UAlbany academic 
advisor who inadvertently pushed 
him to minor in film studies as he 
was about to flunk out of college 
due to low grades. 
Perhaps what every struggling 
student needs is a simple wake up 
call.

UALBANY THEATER

By KEVIN MERCADO

The University at Albany Theater 
program is tackling the controversial issue 
of rape and rape culture with the play 
“Good Kids,” in a current way: how social 
media and new technology play a key role.
Written by Naomi Iizuka, the play is 
based on the real life events of the 2012 
Steubenville High School rape case in 
Ohio. A high school girl went to a party 
that a classmate was hosting. After a few 
alcoholic drinks, she woke up in a different 
house completely naked with no memory 
of the night before, only to find out she 
had been sexually assaulted. The events 
were then posted online via Twitter and 
YouTube. 
“Many people, whether they talk about 
it or not, have gone through this or knows 
someone who has,” said Kim Stauffer, a 
professor at UAlbany and the director of 
the play. “[It’s] an issue that I’m also pretty 
fierce about.”
Years ago, Stauffer worked as a 
volunteer at a sexual assault crisis 
intervention hotline and said that the stories 
she heard really stayed with her.
“I’m new at UAlbany, but this was 
something that the theater program was 

talking about doing… I didn’t pick it to 
make it divisive,” Stauffer said. “[It’s 
a] huge factor in the lives of students on 
campus.”
The play was originally written in a high 
school setting, but for the purposes of the 
production is geared toward for a college-
aged audience and cast. 
Stauffer explained that auditions 
began in the first week of September and 
rehearsals began about a week or two later. 
She said that there are no “key” characters 
but that it is an ensemble cast, with each 
character getting about as much stage time 
as everyone else.
“I picked the people who I thought were 
best for those roles… Like Sarah Vargas, 
she’s a firecracker and so is her character,” 
Stauffer said. “I don’t just want actors, I 
want people who are ready to be student 
leaders.” They will be seen on campus, 
Stauffer pointed out, and they will be the 
ones who continue the conversation.
“[It’s an] important play to talk about,” 
said Kay Broughton, 21, who plays mean 
girl Briana, “Some people will come with 
preconceived ideas of what to expect.”
“To me, I don’t think it’s about rape, 
it’s about people’s reaction and how they 
respond,” said Lisa Warner, 21, who plays 

Skylar, the girl who blows the whistle on 
the case.
The play takes a very 21st century 
approach to rape. The Steubenville rape 
case was thrust into the national spotlight 
because the assault was recorded, live-
tweeted, and posted on several other social 
media platforms.
Warner said that she thinks this is a 
play about “how much power media has in 
society.” 
Having the case displayed all over the 
Internet was humiliating, but also brought 
sympathy to her case as well.
Tyiesha DeJesus, 20, plays Chloe, the 
rape victim, says “One thing I learned 
is that the accused have their own story 
and they do have a background, but that 
regardless of their background, they are 
still responsible for their actions.”
The victim of the assault was demonized, 
according to Stauffer, especially by parents, 
coaches, and reporters.
“The play does do a good job of having 
scenes that break up the tense moments,” 
said DeJesus. 
The play incorporates rewinds, pauses 
and an omniscient character who controls 
the cast, according to Cameron Rivers, 
25, who plays star football player Connor. 

These scenes are referred to as the “Good 
Kids” chorus scenes, where the cast 
assumes different roles in brief scenes to 
explain the public opinion on the matter 
and then resume their given roles.
Straker hopes that audiences understand 
what is and what is not rape. Straker tried 
not to relate to it too much and simply said 
that “it’s just acting.”
Rivers added that the cast tries to keep a 
positive attitude afterward and be “sensitive 
to [their] fellow actors.”
What should audiences expect when they 
see this play?
“Great acting, great lighting, great 
sound,” some of the cast said. But most 
importantly audiences should “come in 
with an open mind.”
“Good Kids” began running Thursday, 
Nov. 5 and will continue to run this 
upcoming weekend. There is also a 
“Talkback” after every show where 
audience members can discuss what 
they’ve seen, heard, and felt with Stauffer, 
some cast members and Carol Stenger, 
director of the Advocacy Center for Sexual 
Violence.
“Hopefully, [audiences] walk away 
feeling like they’re a part of it,” said 
Stauffer.

Are you an under-the-radar comedian 
who’s looking for a chance to get up on 
stage and get some laughs? Make Me Laugh 
Albany is perfect for aspiring comedians in 
the Capital Region.
Make Me Laugh is a nationwide program 
established by comedian Dan Frigolette, 
known for creating the Hoboken Comedy 
Festival. The program is a friendly 
competition between local comics to laugh-
battle it out to see who is the funniest. Make 
Me Laugh has traveled nationwide to find 
undiscovered comics, visiting cities like 
Binghamton, N.Y., St. Louis, Mo., Denver, 
Colo., and Anchorage, Alaska.
“Make Me Laugh is basically an amateur 
talent hunt looking for the funniest comedian 
in whatever city we go,” Frigolette said.
Auditions for Make Me Laugh Albany 
were held last Tuesday, Nov. 3 on the 
University at Albany campus, where eight 
students showed off their comedy skills. 
Laughter was bouncing off of the lecture 
center walls as the performers all brought 
their A-game.
The Make Me Laugh Albany semifinals 
followed on Thursday, Nov. 5. The event 
took place at The Albany Comedy Works, 
one of the small number of local comedy 
clubs besides the newly-opened Funny Bone 
Comedy Club at Crossgates Mall. The lack of 
comedy venues in Albany was a major reason 

why Make Me Laugh came to Albany to give 
a chance for unknown comics.
“What happens is [that] in a small market, 
the amount of opportunities for young comics 
is very tiny,” said Frigolette.
 Small market cities like Albany and 
Binghamton lack the needed opportunities 
and establishments that large metropolitan 
areas have, such as New York City. Make 
Me Laugh gives comics living in these 
small market cities a chance to hone their 
comedic skills as well as get some much 
needed publicity. The program also attracts 
the attention of local media so the comics 
participating get some coverage.
“When you start it’s a hard thing to try 
to figure out how to get your ideas out in 
the funniest way possible, the cleanest way 
possible, the fastest way possible,” Frigolette 
said.
Unfortunately, the only UAlbany 
semifinalist who attended the semifinals 
show was Joe Foti, a member of The Sketchy 
Characters, an improvisational group on 
campus. Nonetheless, Foti was ready to show 
off his comedic chops. 
“If I can make some people laugh, that’s 
the best part,” Foti said on the night of the 
semifinals.
Comedians Jaye McBride and James 
Myers opened and closed the show, 
respectively. Various other comedians and 
reporters rounded out the judging panel, 
including Amy Nolte of Proctors’ Mopco 
Improv group and Robert O’Leary, publisher 
of the Saratogian, along with Frigolette 
himself.
Frigolette believes that to become a 
successful comedian, you have to keep 
performing. 
“Every time you get on stage you will get 
funnier,” he said. “It’s going to suck for a 
while. Eventually, the pieces are going to fall 
into place.”
The Make Me Laugh Albany finals will 
be held this Saturday on Nov. 14 at the Glen 
Falls Civic Center. 

LOCAL LAUGHS
Filling Albany with laughter:
Make Me Laugh finds talent

By AMANDA CASE

The stars of the hit comedy television 
show “Impractical Jokers” hit the main stage 
at Proctors Theatre on Thursday, Nov. 5 
for a night packed with uncensored humor, 
embarrassment and contagious laughter.
The jokers, also known as the New York-
based comedy troupe “The Tenderloins,” are 
made up of four lifelong friends: Brian “Q” 
Quinn, Joe Gatto, James “Murr” Murray and 
Sal Vulcano. The guys visited Schenectady 
for the second show on their hilarious 
“Where’s Larry?” Tour. 
These four have taken their TruTv 
hidden-camera series, which they created 
and produced, to new heights and turned 
it into a live performance full of improv, 
never-before-seen video clips and whimsical 
personal stories. 
“I love performing live even more than 
making the show,” said Murray. “It’s a 
really great feeling being able to interact 
with an audience.” 
“Impractical Jokers,” shot mainly in New 
York City and New Jersey, follows the 
jokers as they compete to embarrass each 
other through ridiculous public pranks. If 
they refuse to do what they’re told, they 
lose. The person with the most losses at the 
end of each episode is punished and, most of 
the time, in an outrageous fashion.
During the live show, the jokers shared 
some of their favorite memories from the 
last three seasons, which included bonus 
footage from their challenge “A-Whole on 
Wheels,” a clip of Murray eating dog poop 
for $250, and pictures of their embarrassing 
tattoos that came from one of the more 
recent punishments.  
Last season, Gatto punished the other 
guys during an episode by making them get 

permanent tattoos that he picked out. None 
of them knew what their tattoos were until 
they stepped outside to reveal them to the 
cameras. 
Quinn’s tattoo was a picture of a cat on 
his inner bicep that read, “38, lives alone, 
has 3 cats,” and Vulcano had Jaden Smith’s 
face permanently inked on his thigh.
However, the packed audience was able 
to really feel up-close and personal with 
Murray when he pulled down his pants to 
reveal his tattoo of a ferret skydiving on his 
thigh.  
That wasn’t the only time someone pulled 
down their pants on stage.
As part of the show, the guys took an 
audience member’s phone to demonstrate a 
game they like to play when they go out. But 
they took things to the extreme when Gatto 
pulled down his pants to take a picture of 
his butt and send it to someone in the fan’s 
phone. 
It was one of the more outrageous 
moments of the show and the crowd was 
almost crying from laughter.  
These playful guys from Staten Island 
have proven they’re not afraid to cause a 
scene, even in front of 2,500 people. 
After the show, the jokers stopped by 
their bus to meet and hangout with some 
fans before they hit the road again. 
It turns out they are the same quirky guys 
in person as they are on-screen. They were 
able to connect with their fans in a charming 
way that made everyone feel like they were 
a part of the group. 
“Impractical Jokers” is currently in its 
fourth season and is rumored to have a fifth 
season on the way, proving the guys might 
have even more ingenious pranks up their 
sleeves.

Great Dane-
turned-K.C. Chief 
living NFL dream

By AARON CHERIS

On Saturday, Nov. 
1, 2014, tight end Brian 
Parker and the University 
at Albany football team 
played at Cowell Stadium 
in New Hampshire and 
lost 49-24 in front of 3,536 
fans. 
Exactly one year later 
on Sunday, Nov. 1, 2015, 
Parker made his NFL debut 
for the Kansas City Chiefs 
at London’s Wembley 
Stadium in front of 83,624 
fans as the Chiefs defeated 
the Detroit Lions 45-10.  
The year in between has 
been full of ups and downs 
for the former Great Dane, 
and now he is getting the 
opportunity to live the 
dream of many Americans. 
“I’ve always pictured 
myself playing in the 
NFL,” Parker said. “That’s 
obviously always what I 
wanted to do.” 
During the Chiefs bye 
week following their game 
in London, Parker and his 
agent Kevin Gold, also a 
UAlbany graduate, returned 
to campus to speak at an 
Albany Sports Business 
Organization meeting on 
Thursday night.
The duo spoke of how 
they met a few years ago 
while Parker was a student. 
Their relationship has 
carried over to the NFL, 
where Parker was the third 
Great Dane to play in a 
regular season game. 
“I had the opportunity 
to come back to campus 
last year and give a speech 
about sports business and 
getting a job that you’re 
passionate about,” Gold, 
a member of the class 
of 1989, said. “While I 
was doing that speech, 
Brian Parker was in the 
audience. I knew a little 
bit about him, talked to 
him afterwards, and I was 
fortunate enough to have 

him agree to help him on 
his journey to the NFL.” 
During his final year at 
UAlbany, Parker impressed 
NFL scouts with his size 
and skill. After he wasn’t 
selected in the NFL draft, 
he signed a free agent 
contract with the San Diego 
Chargers in May. 
“I chose San Diego 
because it was the best spot 
for me roster wise, being 
undrafted,” Parker said. 
“I really liked what they 
had planned for me. I did 
a workout here with San 
Diego, so I knew they liked 
my talent first hand.” 
Parker said he thought 
he was impressive with 
the Chargers during the 
preseason. But being 
impressive couldn’t help 
him beat the NFL numbers 
game. When the Chargers 
cut their roster from 90 to 
an NFL mandated 53 for 
the regular season, Parker 
was one of the casualties. 
Before he could sign 
with the Chargers practice 
squad, he had to pass 
through waivers, where all 
31 other teams in the NFL 
would be able to claim 
him. The Chiefs claimed 
Parker, and he had to drop 
everything and move his 
life to Kansas City. 
“I got a call from Kevin 
and he told me that I’m a 
Kansas City Chief,” Parker 
recalled. “I had to get up 
and go, this is 10 o’clock in 
the morning. I was planning 
on being in San Diego, not 
expecting to move my life 
away.” 
Once he got to the 
Chiefs, he had to wipe out 
everything he learned in 
San Diego and start all over 
again. 
“It was a tough 
adjustment. Just kind of 
starting all over. I’m behind 
everyone,” Parker said of 
the transition. “But I think 
I’ve been doing well and 

learned as much as I can.” 
With the Chiefs, Parker 
made the 53-man roster but 
wasn’t one of the 45 players 
who dresses for the game 
for the first seven weeks 
of the season. Although 
he wanted to play, Parker 
thinks the time on the 
sideline prepared him for 
game action. 
“I started getting into a 
rhythm. I’m trying to do 
everything I can and help 
the team,” Parker said. “I 
was a little stressed during 
the week not having to 
expect to play on Sunday.” 
After a long wait off the 
field, Parker’s opportunity 
came calling in London. 
Once Parker found out he 
would play in the game, it 
was a moment of joy for 
both himself and his agent. 
“It was the greatest 
feeling,” Gold said. “To 
wake up, to watch a game 
at 9:30, and see a guy you 
saw a year ago, just an 
Albany student, now he’s 
playing at the highest level, 
it’s an incredible journey 
and an incredible story.” 
During his first game, 
Parker didn’t make a catch, 
but made several key 
blocks that led to Chiefs 
touchdowns in the victory 
over Detroit. Now that 
he’s had his taste of NFL 
action, Parker is going to do 
everything he can to stay in 
the lineup. 
“You could never take a 
play off. You’re not going 
to keep your job very long 
if you’re not giving it your 
all every chance you get,” 
Parker said. “In the NFL, 
they always want guys to 
keep improving because as 
soon as you stop, they’ll go 
to the next guy.” 
Parker hopes to be in 
the lineup for the Chiefs 
next game when they go to 
Denver to play the Broncos 
on Sunday, Nov. 15.

Brian Parker is the third former Great Dane to play in an NFL regular season game. 
He is the first offensive player to do so.

“Frederike 
Helmke, 
Jaclyn 
Hibbs, 
and Laura 
Paige, I thought played excellent the 
whole game under some pretty big 
pressure at times,” Sykes said. Bottino 
was named the tournament’s Most 
Outstanding Player for her strong 
performances in UAlbany’s three 
victories. The championship is the second 
straight one for UAlbany, and the first 
one since the America East conference 
realignment prior to this season. 
    “Winning this back to back and 
showing that last season wasn’t lucky, it’s 
great,” Heuser said. “It feels very good.” 

    As time expired, the Great Danes 
piled on top of Primus before hugging 
and dumping a cooler of water on Coach 
Sykes.
    “When I started here, we were one of 
the bottom five worst teams in division 
one. To get out of that scene and move 
up to finally winning, that is pretty 
satisfying,” Sykes said. 
    Next, the Great Danes will begin the 
NCAA Tournament against Boston 
College on Saturday, Nov. 14 at 2 p.m. at 
the University of Connecticut. 
    “Our motto all year has been one game 
at a time. As with anything, we’re going 
into the game trying to do our best that 
day, and hopefully good things come our 
way,” Sykes said.

right post to make it 1-0 Hartford.
    UAlbany picked up the pace as the 
minutes went on, putting some pressure on 
the Hartford back line.  Mariah Williams 
and Krista Fitzpatrick each tried to connect 
on crosses, but the Great Danes could not 
get shots on either.
    Paltsios took a corner kick in the 21st 
minute and placed the feed just outside the 
goal box. Williams put a header on the ball, 
just missing above the crossbar. Williams 
almost had another chance on a later feed 
from Belak, but the ball was picked up by 
Hartford before a shot came off.
    Hartford had another counter attack in the 
35th minute as a blocked shot eventually 
turned into a corner. After UAlbany 
defended against the corner, Elise Galipo 
tried a ground ball shot from outside the 
box, missing left. The two teams went into 
halftime with Hartford leading 1-0.
    Early in the second half, UAlbany 
pressed and got four corner kicks in less 
than eight minutes. On the fourth, Hartford 
cleared outside the penalty box. Kopp 
blasted the ball back in towards the left 
post, missing just left in the 54th minute.
    On a fifth attempt, Fitzpatrick’s feed 
bounced in the box to Paltsios. Paltsios 
kicked off the second touch as Jurg made 
the stop.
    UAlbany kept getting possession but 
was unable to penetrate the Hartford back 

line on crosses. Kiana Rugar got a look 
in the 70th minute and had a long curling 
shot towards the right corner of the goal, 
missing high. Minutes later, Williams shot a 
line drive to the left post with a falling Jurg 
saving the ball.
    The chances kept coming for UAlbany 
as on a free kick, Kopp got the feed alone 
in the penalty box. She got tangled with 
a defender and lost the ball as the chance 
ended.
    Hartford got a look the other way as 
the Hawks went for a quick strike. Sidney 
Spremullo fired hard at the net from long 
range, sailing the ball high.
    In the 82nd minute, Paltsios sent a free 
kick into the box.  The ball got loose as the 
keeper went forward. Carhart got a tap on 
the ball, turned around and put it into the 
net for the score, tying the game at 1-1.
    The home team looked to attack in the 
coming minutes. UAlbany’s defense held 
and did not allow a shot in that time period.
    Back the other way, UAlbany went 
quickly to the offensive end. As the ball 
approached, the goalie moved up as the ball 
came out to a scrum. As a Hartford defender 
tried to clear out the ball, Kempf emerged 
and kicked towards the goal with her left 
foot, scoring on the open net with 2:17 left 
to give UAlbany the lead 2-1.
    Hartford had a final gasp with a corner 
kick in the Julia Carr’s curl went out of 
bounds on the near post to end the threat.  
UAlbany took home the 2-1 comeback 
victory over Hartford.

By AARON CHERIS

After a thrilling run to the Final Four last season, 
the University at Albany field hockey team took the 
first step toward a repeat run by clinching the America 
East conference championship with a 2-0 win over the 
University of Maine on Sunday afternoon at Alumni Turf. 
“We thought Maine would be a little fatigued from two 
overtime games coming in, but they were not, they played 
awesome,” UAlbany Head Coach Phil Sykes said. “We 
were very thankful to hang on.” 
In the first half, UAlbany (19-2, 8-1 America East) 
opened the scoring about 10 minutes in after earning a 

penalty stroke. Leading scorer Paula Heuser stepped up and 
converted into the bottom left corner from the spot to give 
the Great Danes a 1-0 lead. Maine (19-4, 7-2 America East) 
goalie Emma Cochran dove the right way, but couldn’t 
make the save. 
“I was a little bit nervous but at the last second I decided 
to switch to the other corner,” Heuser said. Maine came 
close to an equalizer after a couple penalty corners. 
However, UAlbany’s defense, led by goalkeeper Maxi 
Primus, denied all opportunities to the Black Bears. Three 
of her four saves came in the first half. As the first half 
drew to an end, the Great Danes capitalized on another 
good chance. Anna Bottino made a good pass from the 

endline to Kelsey Briddell in front of the Maine net. 
Briddell went one on one against Cochran, and scored after 
faking a shot to give the Great Danes a 2-0 lead at halftime. 
In the second half, the Great Danes defense tightened as 
Maine desperately tried to get back into the game. A pair of 
penalty corners for the Black Bears weren’t converted, and 
the Great Danes held on for the 2-0 victory. 
Sykes was pleased with how his team’s defense stood tall 
in the tournament, as UAlbany allowed just one total goal 
in three tournament victories. 
“Our whole defensive back four from Fiori Van Rijswijk, 

WOMEN'S SOCCER

The University at Albany women’s soccer team earned 
its first-ever league title in dramatic fashion on Sunday 
afternoon, rallying with two goals in the final nine minutes 
to notch the 2-1 victory at Hartford to win the 2015 
America East Championship.
UAlbany (11-8-1), which has earned its winningest 
season in its Division I history and tying the most-ever in 
1981 with 11 victories, has earned a berth into the 2015 
NCAA Tournament. 
The Great Danes were down 1-0 with nine minutes 
remaining against Hartford (11-4-4) at Al-Marzook Field at 
Alumni Stadium. Allison Carhart netted a goal in the 82nd 
minute off a Caitlyn Paltsios free kick, then Kelly Kempf 
scored the eventual game-winner off a scrum from long 
range in the 88th minute. Carhart and Kempf, each seniors, 
came off the bench during the game and earned their goals.
“Winning the America East title feels incredible, and it 

was a collective effort,” said UAlbany head coach Caitlin 
Cucchiella, who takes the Great Danes to a league title in 
her third season at the helm. “The team decided, no matter 
what the situation, that they would stay focused and get the 
win.”
Kempf, the tournament MVP, Paltsios, Caroline Kopp 
and Savanah Courtney were named to the 2015 America 
East All-Tournament Team.
“I know a ball went up into the air, and I just took my 
chance and went for it,” said Kempf of her game-winning 
goal. “We knew we had to stay positive to come back, and 
it is the best feeling in the world to win.”
“It feels absolutely amazing, and it is one of the happiest 
moments of my life,” said Carhart. “We have worked so 
hard this year and put a lot past us, and it feels great.”
UAlbany will enter the 2015 NCAA Tournament having 
won its last five games, including two comeback wins in 

the America East Tournament.
In the game, UAlbany outshot Hartford 13-6, including 
10-1 in the second half. Alana Olivieri earned her fifth 
straight victory in goal, playing all 90 minutes.
Aaliyah Ingram scored Hartford’s goal in the 6th minute 
off an arc shot off a feed from Kylie Hoang. Jessica Jung 
got the loss in goal, saving four shots in 90 minutes.
In the first half, UAlbany primarily played with 
possession while Hartford went for quick strike counter 
attacks.
UAlbany got the first look on a slow counter as Shelby 
Belak got a pass to Vivian Vega just outside the goal box 
in the fourth minute. Vega tried a quick turnaround shot, 
missing wide of the post.
In the sixth minute, Ingram got the feed outside the 
box near the right corner from Hoang. Ingram kicked a
