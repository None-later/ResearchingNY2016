The numerous lltl)l4.‘..s‘ which the work lsontulns, it is hoped will be found useful
and correct. Some of them have l.,w(m copied with little variation from Morse
and Malta Ilrun, and others have been arranged with much care and considerable
labor, expressly for the work.

In giving this little volume to the public, I cannot but entertain the hope that
I shall contribute in some degree to our improved method of teaching a. science
to necessary and popular as that of Geography. But how far I shall have the

Interaction of seeing this hope realized, the public must determine.
