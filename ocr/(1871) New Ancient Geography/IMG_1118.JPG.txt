INTRODUCTION.

 

ANCIENT GEOGRAPHY is a description of that portion of the
earth known to the inhabitants of the ancient world, from the
remotest times to the ﬁnal overthrow of the Western Empire.

There is a striking uniformity in the earliest notions enter-
tained by the nations of antiquity in reference to the form of the
earth. The general opinion held by each nation was that its
inhabitants occupied the exact centre of an immense plane
surrounded by water, and that the earth itself was the centre
of the visible universe. An examination of the views of

Hebrew, Hindoo, Chinese, Persian, and Grecian authorities,
proves conclusively the general recognition of this predominant

idea.
The history of ancient geography may be divided into four

periods :

I. The mythical period, extending from the remotest ages to

the time of HEn0’D0'1‘Us, about 450 13.0.
In regard to this period but little is known deﬁnitely, the

principal source of information on the subject being tradition

and fabulous tales.
According to HOMER, who ﬂourished probably about 1000 B. 0.,
