description of Asia, though not equally precise, contains an

Libya, which he had personally visited, are described very fully.
Subsequent to the time of Hero’dotus, THUoY'DIDEs of Athens

(born 471 13.0.), the author of the history of the Peloponnesian

War, and XE/NOPHON (born at Athens about 444 13.0.), in the
Ana’ basis and O‘:/ropcdla, added much valuable and accurate
information to the sum of geographical knowledge. NEARCHUS,
who accompanied the Asiatic expedition of Alexander the Great

(325 B. 0.), sailed down the Indus, and from its mouth round
the southern coast of Asia as far as the mouth of the Euphra’tes.
The results of his observations during the voyage, which lasted
ﬁve months, were taken down and preserved. The expedition,
of which he formed the directing chief, furnished a vast amount
of information in regard to India, its extent and its resources.
During this period, the erroneous opinions, which had pre-
vailed in regard to the earth’s form, were successfully dissipated
by the various schools of philosophy, and the idea of the earth
having the form of a globe was gradually adopted by persons

of education :
