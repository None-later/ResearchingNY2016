positive ideas on the subject; but as man advances in civilization, A»
and in proportion as history becomes useful and important, its cer

Vari.o"us notions have been formed With respect to the population
of the antediluvi-an world and its physical appearance; but as these
are rather matters of theory than of fact, they scarcely fall with-
in the province of history; and they are of the less consequence,
because we are certain that the state of those antediluvian a es
could have had no material inﬂuence on the times which succee ed

them.
The books of Moses alford the earliest authentic history of the

ages immediately following the deluge.

About 150 years af;er that event, Nimrod (the Belus of profane
historians) built 1:3-abylon, and Assur built Nineveh, which became the
ca ital of the Assyrian empire.

inus the son of Bolus, and his queen Semiramis, are said to have
raised the empire of Assyria to a higher degree of splendour.

From the death of N inias the son of Ninus, down to the revolt of
the Modes under S-ardanapalus, a eriod of 800 years, there is a
chasm in the history of Assyria and abylon. This is to be supplied
