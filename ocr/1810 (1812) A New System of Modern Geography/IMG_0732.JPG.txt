of science and literature. They are gay and thoughtless:
and though subject to violent passions, they ‘are mild,
and fond of amusements, and the gentle arts of ingenious
fancy. They would not dare to drag the huge pines from
the snowy mountains, or pursue the Whales ‘to Green-
land or the southern pole. Accordingly, Providence has
planted their ﬁelds with the bread-fruit tree, the cocoa,
the banana, the plantain, and many delicious fruits, which
spontaneously furnish these indolent nations w.ith,pleas-

blossoms and fruit all the year. Their leaves, some or s

The portion of the temperate zone between the 35th

and 45th degrees of N. lat. seems to be the most delight-

are all the most famous places on the earth, rich and pop-
ulous countries, ‘renowned for their achievements and
knowledge, their refinement and virtue. Some part of
Africa, the greater part of Asia, and North America, all
Europe and the United States, lie in this happy region
of the. globe. In this favourite situation, the religion of
man is most pure, his attainments most splendid, his
character most elevated; here “ he has displhyed the
extent of his genius in literature, in policy, in commerce,
