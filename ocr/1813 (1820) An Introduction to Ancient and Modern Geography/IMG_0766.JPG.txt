PREFACE. " V

The ssntne may be said"With respect to the latitude
and longitude, and the bonntlm-ies of places. Should
the boundaries of all the countries and kingrlomsin
the world be learned from the book, which the pup}!
will always prefer to learning them from the map,
they would not long; be recollected, nor would there
be any distinct idea of their extent and situation; but
if taken from the V map, they cannot but be recollect-
cd, and if faithfully studied two or three times over,
a picture of the ea1'th’s surface will always be distinct
and familiar to the mind.

The maps, which accompany this geography, are
engraved from VV1lkinson’s, whose authority was, by
the late Rev. Mr. Buclnninster, pronounced as good
as could he followed: and although some of them
may appear too full of names for the use of learners,
the inconvenience, should it be thought one, may ca-
sily be remedied by drawing a black mark with a pen
u.nrler~«.tlmc>e words. to which grarticuI§t“""“n’ff‘éﬁ!15n is
required. This suﬁiciently distinguishes the most
important words. and for use, the maps will be rather

. beneﬁted, than injured or defaced.

Besides Goldsmith and Guy, the authors. who
have been consulted in making this compilation, are
Pinkerton, VVall<er, Adams. Reeves, Evans, Sec. In
the part relating to the projection of maps, much as-
sistance has been received from a learned and much
respected friend.

Tlxefalzawing observations are dceigzwti to assist teacé»
crs, who have ylzadv bu: imﬁerfeet, on-rm geagrgfnﬁieal
iustryction, and «mo may wish to ad-ifzz a marked,

~  tiasbcerz atzgndcd with great sizrccsa.

iIn t;t§cl:ingi_ geography lot the pupils always aid
with  ﬁnes toward {he north.
