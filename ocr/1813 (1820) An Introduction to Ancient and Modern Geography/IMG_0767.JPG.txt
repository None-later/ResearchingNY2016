Learners should always be required, for a considera- 
ble time at least, to point out the place asked either
with their finger, or something they may hold in their
,.hand for the purpose. In this way the pupils must al-
ways see the place, and the teacher will know it is seen.

tlicsc become familiar, as they will in a few minutes,
ifaskcd in haste and with proper variation, add a few
more questions, by naming some of the largest islands
or seas. Then proceed to ask the principal divisions
in Amca, and in N. and S. America; ﬁrstpointing
out the names of the places, and then requiring the
ﬂu/lils to do it, as fast as the questions are asked ; al-
ways obliging them to name in wliiit part the place is
situated, according to the following examples.

Where is Lapland ?———In the north of Europe. _
Where is Patagonia ?—At the southern extremity of

S. America. _
