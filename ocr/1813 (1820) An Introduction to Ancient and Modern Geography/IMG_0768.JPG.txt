nia should be required; and the rivers, the moun-
tains, the N. S.  and W’. capes, and the several
clusters of islands and their situation. The teachers
will, by the book and the map, be able to point out the
answers to all the above questions, without any dill}-
culty- _ .

in South America, the boundaries may be omit-

ted; but in most of the divisions, two, three, or more
towns should he ggivcxig and those most important

are found in the book. printed in Italics. The moun-

tains, the large rivers, the islands, and especially the
West Indies, and their situation, and the N. S. E.

and W. capes, should be carefully studied; likewise,
the British and Spanish Dominions in North America,
with their principal towns, rivers, lakes, &c. and
some of the largest islands in the several clusters in
the Paciﬁc ocean; but it will not be necessary to
oblige the learner to commit them all to memory.

The course may be completed with the map of
Great Britain. This country is so important in its
relation to almost every part of the world, '
should be studied with particular attention.

After becoming acquainted with the maps, lati-
tude and longitude will easily be learned. It will be
best not to teach them both at once, or on the same

day, lest, as the words are somewhat similar, the mean-
ing of them be confounded.
