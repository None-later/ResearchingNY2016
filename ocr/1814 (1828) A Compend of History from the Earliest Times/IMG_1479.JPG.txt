ceased, and all the Lhristuan acquisitions in Asia had fallen their Pm d the Prmtmgn

into the hands of the Turks. The wheels of commerce
had just begun to move, and numborless enterprises and
improvements were yet in a state of embryo, when a disco-
very was made of the highest importance to the com-
mercial and literary world. The diiliculty and danger of
voyages at sea, had, from the earliest ages, operated as a
powerful impediment to navigation. It frequently hap-
pened, that a long continued obscuration of the heavenly
bodies, in stormy seasons, was attended with the most
dreadful consequences to whole ﬂeets, which were driven
on shore, without any possible means of foreseeing or
avoiding the danger. The invention of the Mariner’s
Compass, in a great measure remedied these evils. In the
year 1300, the magnetic power to give polarity to iron;
was discovered to he of importance in navigation; and 3
compass vvas constructed, which, at all times, would in-
atantly refer the pilot to any point or course, he wished to-
know. , This truly great and wonderful discovery W33
made by Gova, at Venice ; and may serve to give mankind
a ‘list idea of the supereminence of the Venetians, in ‘naval
