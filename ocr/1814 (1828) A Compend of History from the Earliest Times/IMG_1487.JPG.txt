ignorance. The governments of China, India, Persia and

Arabia know as well the state of their neighbors, as thoseof
Europe do.

best for nations to be ignorant. If knowledge will set men
to killing one another with diabolical rage and infernal ma-
lice; yea, if it will make men, in this respect, worse than
devils, it had better be let alone. Our Saviour aﬂirms, that
therejs a degree of ' union in Satan’s kingdom; and a- great
poet declares,
