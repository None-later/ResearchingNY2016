in itself, and necessary to man’s eternal well—being, that God

When God’s character and pcrfections are once disco-

vered, we then can easily perceive traces of them in his
works; but if God had never revealed himself to man in
any special way, it is extremely doubtful, whether tk
llllml of man ever would have reachecldhe first cause, even
in conjecture. We often hear it observed, that pure Deism
is the most rational and self-consistent of all religions. But
