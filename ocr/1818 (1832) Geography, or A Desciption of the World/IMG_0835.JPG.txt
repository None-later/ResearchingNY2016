In extent it exceeds each of the 0th€_1' qua’ d Ur . its
world. Its mountains are of astonishing gra; 8 M St
lakes and its rivers are unequalled ‘on the glo e. d 0
of the metals, minerals, plants,‘ fruits and trees, foun on

in greater quantities and in higher perfection. . .

America remained unknown to the inhabitants of the other
hemisphere, until about the close ofthe ﬁfteenth century,

tive of Genoa, who, conceiving the bold design of sailing‘
to India by l.he;IVeSI.,, procured three ships from tiiigﬁoart
of Spain, and heroically ventured his lifegin
