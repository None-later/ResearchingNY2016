THIS work, in its original form, was ﬁrst published in
1819 ; since that time it has passed through many editions
and impressions; and it is now for the third time stereo-

typed.
Modern geography is a branch of science that is continu-

ally changing ; and it is necessary that an elementary trea-
tise on the subject should, every few years, undergo a care-
ful revision.

This work, in the form in which it is now published, has

been revised throughout ; a great part of it has been writ-
ten anew, in order to accommodate it to the present time
and to introduce improvements ; and the most of the book
may be expected to continue for a considerable time with-
~ -I '- p out any great alteration.
” p p T ‘J The statisttcal information, which is the portion that is
most liable to change, being placed in a separate division,
may be altered as occasion may require, without alfectineg
the rest of the volume.

The department of ﬂncient Geography has also been
. revised ; and the portion of Scripture Geography has been
_  o  ‘ M i . T materially enlarged.

3'“ '-"-’«._f   V 5, _  The Modern and ﬂncient ﬂtlasgs which accompany the
" '“’- _‘  T A “Elements” have likewise been revised and improved ,
and the Ancient Atlas has been enlarged by the substitu-
tion of six small maps relating to Scripture Geography,
_ _s _ instead~of the single map of Palestine, which has hereto-
   ‘ _ . fore been contained in the Atlas.
’ V This work has long been in use in many of the most re-
. speetable schools, academies, and seminaries in this com);-
‘ ~.;;‘§.‘.’ try; and it is hoped, that, in its present form, it will be
" found less7unworthy of the patronage which the D0555
have been pleased to give it.
