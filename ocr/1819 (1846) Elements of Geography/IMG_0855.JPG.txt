6. The Hzmmwleh or Himéﬂlaya .Mountains, which sep-
grate Hindostan from Thibet and Tartary, extend about
1,400 miles in length, and are supposed to be the highest
mountains on the globe. The most elevated summits may
be seen at the distance of 230 miles.

7. Some of the largest rivers are the O’by, Yenisei (yen-
e-se’), and Le’na, in the north ; the ﬂmour (a-moor’), Ho’-
ang-H0’, and Ki’ang-Ku’, in the east; the Cambo’clz'a or
Mecon’, Ir1'awa_d’cly, Brahmapowlra, Gan’ges, In’dus, Eu-
phra/tes, and Tt'grzs, in the south.

8. The largest lakes or inland, seas are the Cas’pt'an,
./Tral, and Bii’i/cal.

9. The soil in the northern and central parts isemostly
sterile; but in the southern parts, with the exception of
theisandy desertsin the southwest, it is, for the most part,
extremely fertile. A

10. The climate embraces every variety; and it is ex-
tremely cold inethe north, and hot in the south. The transi-
tion from a-hot to a cold climate, is very sudden, owing to
the great elevation of the central parts, and to the ranges
of high mountains;

11. The islands connected with Asia are very numerous
and important. Those which lie to the southeast of the
continent have been classed in three great divisions, name-
ly, the Eastern ./irchipelﬁtgo, ./lustrwlia, and Polyne’sia;
and they have also been considered as forming a ﬁfth divis
ion of the globe by the name of Oceanlica.

19 In the early ages, Asia was superior to the other
parts of the globe in military strength ; but, in the time of
Alexander the Great, Europe obtained the ascendancy,
which it has ever since possessed, and Asia has continued

comparatively weak. _
‘I3. Asia is,‘ however, esteemed the most fruitful and the

richest part‘ of the globe, and it contains more inhab-
itants than all the, other divisions. Yet the central and
northern parts, including more than half‘ of‘ the continent,

are mostly sterile, and very thinly inhabited. These parts

have but little communicaticrt with the civilized world, and

are, comparatively, but little known.
