side,-_ of‘ the Nile, ennltmexl between two ridges of moun

wins, which are hordererl hy deserts.
5. The only river of Egypt is the celebrated Nile, which

forms the most remarkable feature of the country, and to
which it owes nearly all its fertility.

6. This river annually passes its banks, and overspreatls
the alluvial land hor<lerin;,r upon it like a sea, carrying with
its waters a Fertilizing mud; and almost all the country
that is not thus inundated, is barren, and a great part of
it C0l1..~'i.~‘.t.-§‘Ui' sandy dc.-sert.~'.

7. The lumls which are inundated are celebrated for
their t'ertiiit_y, are cultivated with great ease, and produce
corn and rice in equal perfection.

8. Some of the principal productions besides rice, wheat,
and other kinds of grain, are sugar-cane, cotton, ﬂaw, indigo,
and a variety offruits, particularly dates, which afford the
chief subsistence to a great many of the inhabitants.

9. The climate is peculiarly characterized by an almost
entire absence ofrain, the falling ofieven a few drops being
a rare occurrence. The temperature and ‘appearance of
the country at some seasons are delightful; yet the sum-
mers nreevery hot, and the ravages of the plague ‘frequent.

10; The Great and Little O’ases, which are fertile tracts
in the midst of the desert, are situated to the west of Siut
and Dendera. V

11. The inhabitants are much subject to the ophthalmic, a
severe disease affecting the eyes; and in the spring they
are often annoyed by the simoom or samiel, a hot, suffocat-
ing wind from the desert.

12. The language chieﬂy spoken in Egypt is the .f.lraIn'c ,
andaho_ut two thirds of the inhabitants are ./flrabs, who are
Maihoinﬂétans. The other inhabitan«ts are Capts, who are
d'cscen,ded fromthe ancient Egyptians, and profess §hris-
ti.a'n‘ity ; also" Turks and Jews, who are found mostly in the
cities. -- ‘ _

13. Egypt has been considered,‘ in modern times‘, a‘s_£orm-
ing a pa.rt¥ofhthe‘”I"urkish or Ottoman empire; and it has
beengoverned by a pacha in the name of the Porte ; butt
Mohammad Ali‘ Pacha, some years since, renounced allegi-
ance to the sul‘t§n.r-g  ‘M i
