1. Abyssinia, which lies west of the Red Sea and the
straits of Babelmandel, and contains the eastern sources of
the Nile, is a country of considerable celebrity, though it
has been visited by few modern travellers, and is but little
known.

 It is an elevated and mountainous country, and much
of it is well watered and fertile; and it is rich in animal
and vegetable productions. M

try, the streams of Water, and rain-s, is much cooler than
that of Egypt. '

early period, and are of the Eutychian sect ; but they are

a dark olive complexion, and are noted for their singular

and barbarous customs.

‘g-allus,‘who are far more noted for their ferocious armors
and save e‘-customs‘.
