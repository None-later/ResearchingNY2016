SAHARA, OR THE GREAT DESERT. 

SAHARA, on THE GREAT DESERT.

1. Si»ih’ara, or Zéi’ara, or the Great Desert, which lies
south of Barbary, is about 1,000 miles broad, and, reckon-
ing from the Atlantic to the Nile, about 3,000 miles long;
but the name is commonly limited to the main body, which
lies west of Fezzan, and which is about 2,000 miles in

2. It is raised but little above the level of the sea, and
appears as a vast ocean of scorching sand, having here and
there some oases or -islands, which afford water andivegeta-
tion, and serve as resting and watering places to the cara-
vans that travel over it ; and in some instances they sup
port a number of inhabitants.

3. This vast and dreary abode of solitude and desolation,
is traversed, for purposes of commerce, by caravans, that

roceed from the towns of Barbary, and from Cairo in
Egypt, conveying salt, cloths, and various kinds of Euro-
pean goods to Tonibuctoo, Bornou, and other places in
Central Africa, and receiving, in return, slaves, gold, ivory,
ostrich feathers, civet, and some other articles.

WESTERN AFRICA.

1. Western Africa comprehends all the countries on the
coast, which lie between the desert of Sahara and Bangui’-
la; and it is noted for being the principal theatre of that
inhuman and disgraceful traﬁic, the slave-trade.

‘ 2. This region includes many diﬁerent countries and
kingdoms. The kingdoms of Senegambiri. are in the north ;
those of Guin’ea, in the middle; and the countries of L0
an/go, Cori/go, .ﬁngo’la, and BenguE’ln., in the south, _

3. The principal rivers are the ./Viger, Sen’ega.l, Gam'lna,
Grind, Jl1esurii’do, and Zaire or Con’g'o. _

4. This region lies wholly within the torrid zone, and the
climate is extremely hot, and to Europeans very unhealthy.

5. Much -of the soil is exceedingly fertile; and the coun-
try iscovered with a luxuriant vegetatiori. _

A6. This ‘part of Africa abounds in various animals, pat-
d antelopes; it is also in .
