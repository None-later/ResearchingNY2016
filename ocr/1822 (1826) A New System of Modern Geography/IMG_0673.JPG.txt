Another mode of assisting the memory is by an ingengo
combination of the initials of names. The word VIBGYQIE
contains the initials of the seven primary colours,jn1h
order in which they appear in the rainbow. This methoﬁ
may in some instances be successfully applied to Geogpuph,
For example: the three large towns, Boston, Albany aﬁld
Detroit, are near the same parallel of latitude, and U,
initials spell BAD. Montreal, Albany and New York are
near the same meridian, and the initials spell MAN. The;
six towns, taken together, form a cross, on which BAD MAN
is extended. Expedients of this kind may be proﬁtable in
some cases, yet if they are pursued very far they win
become frivolous, and rather burdensome than useful. The
same remarks are applicable to r/z_z/mes.
., There are various other methods of aiding the ’m*e’moi~
I but the most valuable, where the subject admits oft lhexi,
. are clasn:/ication and a lucid order. These are the method:
; adopted in all the sciences. They are the methods which
 the" memory loves, and which make the acquisition of
knowledge easy and delightful.

communicate to the mind a clear and impressive view of

Geography. . .
It has become customary of late, in Geographies designed

for schools, to omit boundaries and the description ofrixers.
In this work they have been inserted. It is true, that maps
with a series ofjudicious questions, supply in part the place
of a description. Yet they do it imperfectly. In the best
maps, especially in those on a small scale, errors are so
numerous, that the mind cannot rest with conﬁdence in their
testimony. We want the conﬁrmation of the book.—-
Besides, a good description of a river, is the result of much
study, and always suggests the best associations for the aid
of the memory.

The publishers have preparedan Atlas to accompany
this work. The maps are executed in a style of engraving,
superior to what is common in works of the same kind.

The map of the United States appears to be remarkably
well done.

./Fidvertiseinent to the twenty-third edition.

The twenty-second edition of this Geography was pre-
pared for the press with much care, re-written on an im-
proved plan, and accompanied with anew Atlas adapted to
the work. Few alterations have been found necessary in

the present edition. The principal improvement is the
addition of a System of Ancient Geography, accompanied

with an Ancient Atlas of five maps.
