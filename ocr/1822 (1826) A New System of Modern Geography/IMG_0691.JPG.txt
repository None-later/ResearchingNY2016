chic Towns. Sennaar, the capital of the kingdom of

the same name, is on a branch of the Nile, and is said to
n 100,000 inhabitants. Suakem, a port on the Red
considerable trade with Arabia, Eg pt,'and the
. Dongola, the capital of the king cm of Dan-
the Nile, 280 miles S. of Syene.

The climate of this country is hot and un-
healthy. The simoom, or poisonous blast from the desert,
often proves fatal to those who are overtaken by it. The
only resource for the traveller, when he sees it coming, is
to fall ﬂat upon the ground,“ with his face to the earth, till
the noxious wind has gone by. Another curious phenome-
non of the desert is the lofty pillars of sand, which some-
times move across the desert with such rapidity, that the
swiftest horse would in vain attempt to escape them.
