The following opinions of the peculiar plan and executio Ofthls
work are from the most respectable sources, and princi al ’ in
gentlemen whose lives are devoted to the interests an a \_'__ C-

ment of education. . .
From the Journal of Science and Arts, by Br.i\.iAMiN Sn. .iiviAN of

Yale College. _

The principal object of the author, was, to give Geography that

scientiﬁc arrangement which has been so successfully applied to oth-
er branches of study. Little or no use has hithertp been made, by
the greater number of writers, of the important principles of clas_sz-
ﬁcation, in reducing geography to thejbrm ofu science, and thus in-
creasing the facility ofacquiring and retaining its details. The work
is accompanied by an Atlas on a new and ingenious plan. We think
Mr. Woodbridge has succeeded well in his design, and deserves the
thanks and the patronage of’ the community.

Rev. ASHBEL GREEN, D. D. late President qf'Pr2'nceton College.

The plan is ingenious and quite original. Itis admirably adapt-
ed to the capacities of the young ; and cannot fail to arrest and ﬁx
their attention. The study of geography will no longer prove an
irksome task, to perplex the mind and burden the memory ; but will
become a delightful exercise, a sort ofmental recreation, which will
continually cheer and enliven the pupil's exertions, and prompt him
forward, almost unconsciously, to the attainment of one ofthe most
difiicult, useful, and ornamental branches of education.

Rev. ZEPHANIAH Swirr Moons, D. D., late President of Amherst
College. A

The plan is new, ingenious, and interesting. The author has
formed his plan with a due respect to thelaws of mind‘. A correct
classiﬁcation and arrangement ofthe objects ofknowledge, compri-
sed in any ofthe sciences, is of primary importance. The work is.
in my opinion, the best ﬁtted of any thing I have seen, to excite in

the learner an interest in attending to the science of Geography, to .

facilitate his progress, and to discipline his mind.
Rev. CHAUNCEY A. GOODRICH, Professor in Yale College.

Mr. Woodbridge"s Geographical Works are, in my view, distin-
guished by a rich variety of matter, a felicity of classiﬁcation, and
an accuracy of detail, which render them peculiarly valuable as
text books in the instruction of young persons of both sexes.

Rev. THOMAS H. GALLAUDET, Principal of the American ./lsylum -

for the Deaf and Dumb.
, I have no doubt, one month’s trial of it will satisfy the father ofa
' family, or the intelligent master of a school, that it combines ad-
vantages, which render it superior to any book of the kind, for a
similar purpose, now extant.

I

£Eleven editions of this work,’ consisting of more than 125,000 co-

.  fies, have been disposed of since its ﬁi st publication, and the demand :

still increasing. It is claimed that more intelligence, and a greater
mount of knowledge can be drawn from this work and retained in
0 mind, than can be procured from any similar work for schools
,ant.——An elegant edition has recently been published in Eng-

V dhginder favorable prospects of a general introduction in that
