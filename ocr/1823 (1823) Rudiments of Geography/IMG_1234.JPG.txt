he learns that the Northern Countries of’ Europe “have nei-

told again that this is the case in Sweden, Norway, and Lap-
land. By this method the time, and space, and effort of mem-
ory, which would be necessary in repeating‘ the statement
under each country, are saved, and the comparison renders the

idea more valuable to the learner. . .
In acquiring a knowledge of Physical Geography, this

method is particularly useful. When subjects so unchang-

On these principles is founded the plan which forms the

basis of the following work, ofobliging the pupil, by metns
uestions, to acquire his knowledge of natural geography
almost entirely from an atlas. In order to furnish 8 more
complete delineation of noiintrieai, the class of each object is
marked upon it in the iiizips of Llil‘~ work; and by means of
distinct riuinhcrs mid «;'riar.'ii~trer'~'. Lliey exhibit, not only the
place of rivers, mountain:-2 and cities, but their size, the
capitaLs of countries, and the seats of universities. In the
Cliart of the inhabited world, not only the situation and Out-
line: of countries are slioxyn, but their population, government,
religtrin, and stair of crmlizalwn. In the View of Region:
and (,.llIl]i1lCS, the same countries are exhibited with ﬁn“
Ilrk their riimnte, and point out in the list of animals
