A second edition of this work was required within six weeks

after the publication of the first, and no time was allowed for
discovering defects, by its use. The unexpected demand for a.

third edition before the expiration of ii year, cullsfor the grati-
tude of the author to those who have favoured him with their

30l1l1t.€‘112l!1(‘.e and reiiizirks. He has endeavoured to make the

only return in his power, by correcting the defects discovered

by the aid of their experience and observation, and hopes the

work will better deserve the approbation it has received. He
has been careful, however, to make such alteration: only as

an experienced teacher believed would produce no serious

inconvenience to schools, and to preserve the same paging,
except in ii few crises where an alteration was indispensable.
