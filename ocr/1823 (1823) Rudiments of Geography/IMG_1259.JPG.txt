various Couiitries, the degree of heat is not always .

proportioned to the distance from the equator. (Ser-,§

are marked on the general view of the climates and
productions of the earth. (See the Atlas.)

422. It will be observed that the limits of these re-
gions extend from eight to twelye degrees farther north
on the eastern continent than in America ; and also;
that they are much farther from the equator on the
Western coast of each continent, than on the eastern-

their situation and climate, and the wants of the in-
