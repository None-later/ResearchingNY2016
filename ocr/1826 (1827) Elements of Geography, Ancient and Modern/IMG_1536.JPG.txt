for the grateful acknowledgements of the author.
In this third edition the volume has been carefully re-

vised; the arrangement in some cases altered; and the

quantity of matter increased.

A chart of Sacred History, which was wanting to com-
plete the system, has been added to the Atlas. Some of
the other charts have been much altered; and they now
present a complete view of the succession of sovereigns
of all the most important monarchies, both of ancient and
modern times. The whole work, consisting of the history
and the atlas, it is hoped, will be found, in its present state,
more useful and satisfactory than heretofore, and less un-

worthy of the liberal patronage which the public indul-
gence has given it.

preceding the chart of Sacred Histor . But as it now
 5m"(_lS» instructers, who think it advisable, can, without
a any inconvenience, direct it to be studied in that order.

'.-[file chart of Biograp/iy may be omitted till after the
pupil has been through the volume, or the ancient part

may be attended to before the study of Modern History is
commenced. ' .

After a survey of the charts in connexion with the Ele-
ments, they should be thoroughly revised. A series of
questions is inserted, in order to assist the teacher and the
learner ; but in reviewing, the teacher will probably ﬁnd it
expedient not to limit himself to the use of the printed ques-
tions, but will extend the system of examining his pupils
upon the charts, as far as he shall ﬁnd it advantageous.
