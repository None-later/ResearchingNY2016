I1. Sztcred llistory goes back to the rentotcst period of
time, and commences with an account of the creation of
the world, which, according to the commonly received
clirtittttlotgy, took place 400-t years before the Chris-
tian era. !

12. The earliest profane historian, whose» works are
extant, is .Hcrad’ott1s, who is styled the Father of History.
llis history was composed about 445 years B. (3., and com-
prises every thing which he had an opportunity of learning
respecting the Egyptittns, Persians, Greeks, lonians, Lydi-
