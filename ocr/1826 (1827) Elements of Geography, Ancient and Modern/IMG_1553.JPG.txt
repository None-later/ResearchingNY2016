 manners. In the East, particularly in Constantinople, the
crusaders became acquainted with modes oflife superior to
that they had been accustomed to in their own countries,
and of Which, on their return, they were ready to recom-

CHIVALRY.

1. Chivalry was an institution in which valour, gallantry,
and religion were strangely blended. It constitutes one
of the most remarkable features in the history of European
nations in the Middle Ages, and, during several centuries,
it produced a wonderful inﬂuence upon their opinions,
habits, and manners; the eﬂects of which may still be
traced. Its distinguishing features were a romantic spirit
of adventure; a love of arms, and of the rewards of minor;
an eagerness to succour the distressed, and to rednlﬁ
wrongs; high sentiments of honour and religion; and 8
devoted and respectful attachment to the female sex. ,
