‘V PREFACE.

similar to that adopted in the author’s Epitome of G
ography; a plan which is very simple, and perfectlii
easy, both to the teacher and pupil, and which W31
readily unfold itself as the work is perused,

The Epitome and the accompanying ﬂtlas are to be
used throughout in connexion; and the matter is all
along arranged in the order in which it is deemedmost
advisable that it should be studied.

The study of Geography ought always to precede
the study of History ; but a pupil who has made him.
self well acquainted with such a treatise as the Epitome
of Geography above mentioned, may with advantage
attend to this abstract. i

This work has been made concise, in order that it 

might be adapted to the wants of such as have not
heretofore been accustomed to attend to the subject
while at school, and that the expense might be so small
as to place it within the reach of all classes. Butthough

the plan is concise, it is comprehensive ; and the Book, ii

together with the Atlas, will be found to contain much 

important historical information, and will give the pupil
a general view‘ of the rise, progress, revolutions, de-
cline, and fall of the principal states and empires, and
furnish him with a connected series of many of the
most interesting events, from the remotest ages to the
present time.
It is highly important that the study of History and
Chronology should be generally introduced into our

common schools, that young persons of both sexes may
be instructed in their outlines. This is desirable, not

so much for the sake of the knowledge thus to be ac-
'‘’?quired, as for the beneﬁt which it may afford as afoun-

dation for further improvement, by enabling the pupil
to pursue the study with satisfaction and advantage.
