continued and vigorous perseverance by men of intellectual
powers of the highest _order;. and from their discoveries, es.
pecially those of the distinguished Cuvier, we learn the fol-
lowing facts respecting the formation and the revolutions of
the earth.

To the origin of the solid nucleus of the earth no date can
be assigned. _Water invested it; and the acotyledonous
plants, and . staceous tribes of ﬁsh, were the commence-
ment of vegetable and animal life. A violent revolution of
nature annihilated these incipient creations, and their re-
mains combined with other substances to increase the stone’
of the earth. In the various successive periods appeared the.

mollusca, the ﬁshes, the amphibious animals, all of‘ gigantic: »

size; and all after living their appointed period were de»
stroyed, and their remains employed as the materials of addi-9
tional surface For the advancing earth. The mammalia of the
waters, sea-horses, sea-lions, whales, and their whole kindred,
formed the next step of the progression. The violent mos
tions and agitations of‘ the waves destroyed these also, that
they might add their huge carcasses to the inanimate surface
of the earth, which now attained that state in which it sent
ii vegetation adapted for the support of animals of the land.
Dllature now put forth her strength in the production of the
monstrous megatheria, mastodons and mammoths, whose re-
mains excite our wonder andbur curiosity. This race, too,
after having possessed the earth for an indeﬁnite period, saw
its appointed end come: the waters rose once more, and in-
volved them, like their predecessors, in the clay, sand, and
gravel, which they swept along; l)}l}.lel'. no rptelry sgmgmm
