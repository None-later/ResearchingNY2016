I4 OUTLINES OF HISTORY. PART L

mankind perished, save Noah and his family, some’ how
ever, contend, that the words of the_ inspired writer are n ;
to be taken so strictly, and that as his information was de:
lined iiir a particular portion oﬁmankind, it may have been
only intended to instruct them in the history of the race to
which they belonged, while that of other races may have
been passed over in silence. Hence they would infer that we
are not precluded by the Mosaic writings from supposing, that
at the time of the great inundation other portions of mankind
may have saved themselves in different manners and places
'f‘hey therefore look to the higher regions of the earth, and
find three elevated ranges in the neighborhood of the three
distinct stems into which we ﬁnd mankind divided. The lofty
range extending from the Black Sea to the east of India has
lwfln at all times regarded as being, either itself or the lands
t~'1)llT,h of it, the original seat of the Caucasian race. Still
more cast, heyonil ’I‘ibet and the desert of Cohi, rises another
range, regarded as the original seat of the Mongol race which
dwells nroiind it: and the Mountains of the Moon and their
branches are thoiiglit to point out the primitive abodes of the
N cgro race. America, it is probable, was not, till long after,
zidapted for the abode of man.

These, however, are all questions of curiosity rather than
of’ historical importance. At the dawn of all history we ﬁnd
the various races of mankind distinct, and no‘ history informs
us of the origin of the diﬁerences. We have therefore only

to consider them in their separate states, or as intermingled

with and ziifecting each other.

Another point which has given occasion to a good deal of
ingenious conjecture, is the original state of mankind. Philo-
sophers, on surveying the human race in its different situa-
tions, have traced out four distinct states,——those of the mere
fruit and plant-eater, the hunter, the herdsman, and the cul»
tivator,—and have generally inferred that man has pro-
gressively passed throu h all these states, commencing at the
lowest. Yet this is stil but mere conjecture, unsupported by
any historic evidence. N o tribe has ever yet been found to
civilize itself; instruction and improvement always come to
it from abroad; and experience would rather lead to the in-
ference, that the savage is a degeneration from the civilized
life. In the very earliest history, that of the Bible, we ﬁnd
the pastoral and agricultural life coexisting almost from the
commencement of the world; at all periods we ﬁnd m
possessed of the useful and, necessary arts, the master of

It is to the Caucasian race that the liistory of the world
must mainly conﬁne itselﬂ, for with that race has originated
almost all that ennobles and digiiiﬁes mankind: it is the
chief depository of literature. anderﬁe great instructor of
philosophical, political, and reel’ ions systems. We shall re-
