Babylon and Assyria.

We now begin to tread on more solid ground for in the
earliest portion of the far most credible ancient history that
of the Hebrews, we observe a recognition of the empirias of
Babylon and Assyria. From them, too, we may infer, that
Babylon was the_ more ancient, for the city of that name is
mentioned at a time while the Hebrews were still in the no-
madic state. We hear not till long after of Nineveh, the
Assyrian capital on the Tigris.

The Babylonians dwelt on the Tigris and the Lower Eu-
phrates, and their industry had made their land the garden
of Asia. They were a peaceful people, as is hown by their
manufactures, and their provisions for watering their land;

Herodotus describes them as a luxurious traﬁicking people,
fond of splendid dress and ornaments. Various dynasties of
kings of the sun-ounding nations are related to have ruled in

@ylon. This wealthy state must have been at all times ex

the yoke, and attained the power we have just described. Of

the Assyrian history little is known. _ . _ '
A caste of priests named Chaldeans, disti ished for their

knowledge of the order and courses of the eavenly bodies,
the objects of Babylonian worship, was to  found here ;_ but
the early establishment of despotism permitted not a. division
of the people into any other castes. These Chaldeans were

divided into several orders under ahead appointed by the
king. Birth was not a necessary qualification for admittance’

into their body. Vic ﬁnd (as in the case of Daniel) Jews
placed in the hijest rank among them. They derived their
support from lands assigned to them. The nature of the oc-
cupations of the Babylonians made a race of men of import-
ance, who pretended to a knowledge of the ways of the gods,
who measured the land, marked the seasons, and announced
the hours of good and evil fortune: yet almost all their boasted
wisdom was mere Jugglery and deceit.
