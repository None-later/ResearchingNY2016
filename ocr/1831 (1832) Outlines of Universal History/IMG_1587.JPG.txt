At a very remote period of antiquity,
caste in B_iibylonia liiid begun to spread
the noinailic t.ribes of the land, a man named Abraham dis.
tinguished by wealth, wisdom, and probity, in obedienize to
the commands of the Deity, quitted the land of his fathers
and 'ourneyed with his family and his herds towards the land
of Lanaan. His faith in the only God, and his obedience to
his will, were here rewarded by increasin wealth and num-
bers. His son and grandson continued e same nomadic
life in Palestine which Abraham and his fathers had led. By
a surprising turn of fortune, one of the sons of Jacob, the
grandson of Abraham, became vizier to the king of Egy t:
he brought his father and ﬁimily to that country, and ii ( is-
trict in the north-east of Egypt was assigned to them by the
lﬁin for the sustenance of themselves and their ﬂocks and

During 430 years their numbers increased exceedingly. A
new dynasty now ﬁlled the Eg ptian throne, and they feared
the power of a numerous peopie attached to the former line,
and dwelling in the key of the land towards Asia. They
sought, therefore, to change their mode of life, and by impos-
in heavy tasks upon them to check their increase, and grad-
ua ly to wear them out.

During this period of 0 pression Moses was born. The
Egyptian monarch had 0 ered all the male children of the
Israelites to be destroyed at the birth; and the mother of
Moses, alter concealing him for some time, was obliged to
expose him. The daughter of the king found him, and reared
