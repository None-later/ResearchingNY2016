ties of the surrounding nations, feasts were held three times
in each year to commemorate their emancipation, the giving
of the law, and their abode in the desert. At these festivals,
all Israel was required to attend, that the bonds of brother-
hood might be kept up among the tribes by participation in
social enjoyment.

Thus, many years before Con-fu-tsee gave the Kings to
the Chinese, long ere any lawgiver arose in Greece, Moses,
directed by God, gave to Israel, in the wastes of Arabia, a
constitution, the wonder of’ succeeding ages, and ever memo.
rable for the inﬂuence it has exerted on the minds and insti-
tutions of a large and important portion of mankind.

During forty years, till all the degenerate race who had
left Egypt had died oﬂ; Moses detained the Israelites in the
deserts of Arabia, accustoming them to obey their law, and
preparing them for the conquest of‘ the land assigned as their
possession. At the end of that period their inspired legislator
led them to the borders of the promised land, and having ap-
pointed Joshua to be his successor, he ascended a lofty moun-
tain to take a view of the country he was not to enter: he
there died in the 120th year of his age. Under the guidance
of Joshua, Israel passed the Jordan; the God of Moses was
with them, and inspired them with valor to subdue their foes.
A speedy conquest gave them the land. No ﬁxed govem-
merit had been appointed; the people gradually fell from the
service of Jehovah to worship the idols of the surrounding
nations; and Jehovah gave them up into the power of their
enemies. At times there arose among them heroes, denomi-
nated judges, who, inspired with patriotism and zeal for the
law, aroused the slumbering tribes, and led them to victory.
Then, too, arose that noble order of prophets who, in heaven-
inspired strains of poetry, exalted the Mosaic law, and im-
phressed ilts precepts, its rewards, and threats, on the minds of

e peop e.
