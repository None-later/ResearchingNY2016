331. Darius Codomanus, the Persian colossus was thrown to th

earth by the arms of Greece. e

For when Artaxerxes II. mounted the throne, his younger

brother Cyrus, who was governor of Lydia, Phrygia, and

Ionia, under pretence of quelling some disturbances in Cﬂicia

, and Pisidia, collected an army in which were 10,000 Greeks,
c 401, and with it marched against him. The armies met at Cu_
naxa, in the neighborhood of Babylon, and victory declared
for Artaxerxes, as Cyrus fell in the action. The Greeks had
on their side been conquerors: they were now deserted by
their Persian confederates, deprived of their leaders by
treachery; yet without guides, they‘, through the midst of a
hostile nation, barbarous tribes, mountains, deﬁles, and deserts,
reached with triﬂing loss the coast of the Euxine. This, when
known in Greece, betrayed the internal weakness of the Per.
sian empire. Agesilaus the great Spartan had collected a
Grecian army in Lesser Asia, the ax was apparently laid to
the root of the Persian monarchy, when Persian gold eﬁ'ect-
ed what Persian steel could not: bribery armed a confederacy
in Greece against Sparta, Agesilaus was recalled to the de-
fence of his country, and the fate of Persia was delayed for

a season. ‘

The Persian dominions at the period of their greatest ex-
tent embraced India west of the Indus, and all the country
between it and the Mediterranean, Lesser Asia, Thrace,
Palestine, and Egypt: Arabia paid tribute; the mountain-
tribes of Caucasus and the Turkish borderers were number-

’ ed among its subjects. Yet, as the instance of the Carda-
chians or Koords proves, there were many tribes in the very.
heart of the empire who yielded but a nominal submissions
maintaining nearly total independence. Under Cyrus, each
subject state was left its own form of government, only bound
