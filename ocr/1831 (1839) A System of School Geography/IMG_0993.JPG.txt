The religion of some savage nations

consists only of certain absurd supersti- 
tious notions, some of them derived from i
the preceding systenis, and others appa- i
reiitly the invention of their priests. In
general, it may be remarked, that all these
various schemes are characterized by the
grossest absurdity in their doctrines and
ceremonies. The practical morality of
them all is of the lowest and coarsest kind,
and their effect is uniformly to debase the
mind and corrupt the heart. No elevat-
ingand purifying principle pervades them ,
and their only use seems to be that of fur-
nishing knavish and designing priests
with the means of deceiving and ruling
their deluded followers. The whole mim-
ber of Pagans in the world is probably
about 500,000,000, including the greatest
part of the human race...
