m'sz'0-ns.

1. EUROPE is bounded on the north
by the Arctic Ocean; on the east by the
Ural Mountains, the River Ural, and the
north-Western shores of the Caspian Sea;
on the south by the Black and Mediter-
ranean Seas; and on tl1e west by the
Atlantic Ocean. It is more indented by
seas, gulfs, and bays than any other quar-
ter of the globe, and therefore abounds
in islands, peninsulas, and isthmuses.

2. The ‘White Sea lets in the cold
waters of the Arctic Ocean to Northern
Russia, from which it separates Lapland.
In South Russia, the Caspian, the largest
salt lake in the world, dashes its waves
upon the Volga plains, and the Sea of
Azof ﬂows far up into the plains of the
Don. Azof Sea on one side, and the
Black. Sea on the other, enclose the

charming peninsula

3. The Gulf of Botlima and the B31. 
tic Sea with its outlet, sepm-ate the _ _
famous Scandinavian peninsula, consisting
of Norway and Sweden, from the rest
of Europe ; while the peninsula of Dem
mark divides the North Sea from the
Baltic. The Sea of Marmora, with 3
strait at each end, connects the Black
and Mediterranean Seas, and separate;
Europe from Asia. The Archipelago,
dotted with lovely islands, rolls its purple
waves between Asia Minor and Greece,
Greece, a kind of epitome of Europe, like
it, is intersected by many gulfs and buys.
Boot—shaped Italy divides the Gulf of
Venice from the Tuscan Sea and the
Gulf of Genoa. The Spanish peninsula,
consisting of Spain and Portugal, pushes
far to the south—West, where it is separat-
ed from Africa by the narrow Strait of
Gibraltar.

4. The islands of Europe present a
vast variety of climates from the ‘isles
of drear Lutfoden,’ the stormy Ork-
neys and volcanic Iceland, to the sunny
shores of Candia, Sicily, Sardinia, Cg;-.
s1ca,MaJorca, and Minorca, and the moist

but equable temperature of England and
Ireland.
