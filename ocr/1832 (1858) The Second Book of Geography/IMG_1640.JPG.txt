ple can walk from one to another, the
whole length of a street. The popu-
lation is about 100,000. The sovereign
of Morocco is styled emperor, and rules
despotically. His state is founded on
very ancient Oriental principles of gov-
ernment. One of its customs is, that
the emperor takes as many of the daugh-
ters of his nobles as he chooses for
wives, and thus the government is a
family interest. Embroiled in a con-
test with France, in 1844, the Emperor
of Morocco was obliged to yield to her
demands, after Tangiers and lllogador
had been bombarded, and his army

routed.
