Geographical knowledge, more than any other, is in Jill: natpre
progressive. The field it embraces is large, and has as yet ccn tut
superﬁcially or partially surveyed. Of many parts of t e world we
are still extremely ignorant. They are yet to be explored. And as
travellers and adventurers are becoming more numerous, ii_it.e1ligent,
and faithful, new degrees of light are afforded, and fresh discoveries
made, so that the subject excites a continually increasing inte rest.

PREFACE. V3’,

poet, have perhaps in the school-room, ﬁrst imbibed a love for history,
eloquence, and poetry, and begun to pant with ardor after distinction
in the favorite pursuit. Many a noted voyager and benefactor, like
Columbus, has, in the prosecution of his geographical studies, inwardly
burned with the desire and resolution to circumnavigate the globe and
to satiate his curiosity by visiting all countries and nations; and how
many valuable discoveries and noble deeds have hence resulted! No
doubt many a pious youth, while reading or hearing impressive descrip-
ations of ‘the vices and miseries of pagan millions, has formed his first
resolve to become a missionary, and devote his life and talents to the
iJ1'lOSt benevolent and sacred enterprise of publishing abroad the joyful
ziews of redemption. These are some of the happy effects of the use
of well written geographical school books. It is therefore gratifyinﬁto
perceive the more general attention, which, for several years past a as
ineen given in schools to this branch of knowledge, the greater facili-
ties aﬂ"orded for the study of it, and the more rapid progress generally
exhibited by learners.‘

It is the author’s design, in the following work, to co-operate with
other authors in endeavoring to excite and encourage the attention of
youth to a branch of learning which is every day becoming more and
‘more important, and to lend them assistance in their application to it.
“He considers a familiar acquaintance with maps as the ground work
of all geographical knowledge, and as preceding in the order of nature,
any particular statement of facts; at the same time he would avoid
‘burdening the memory of the scholar, or wearying his patience, by
being tediously minute or prolix, in questions or travels on the map.
It is not to be expected that any pupil can long retain in his memory
very great proportion of the names and words on every map, nor is it
worth while to lay upon him this task; but the distinct outlines and
boundaries of countries, and the most prominent points, features, and
places, should be particularly and repeatedly noticed, and perrnanelttl-iy
ﬁxed in the mind.

There should be also, in the author’s opinion, considerable descrip-
tion in our geographical books, especially for the older class of pupils;
-something to inform their understandings, increase their stock of'know-
ledge, awaken and sustain their interest in the subject, and least} to
practical advantages. The study, instead of being rendered dry, dim-
cult and irksome, may be, and ought to be, made easy and agreeable.
The proposed limits of this work would not admit of many minute and
copious descriptions. Conciseness and brevity have neeessarilyglmien
consulted. It is however hoped that a considerable variety of aw "
ant facts may here be found stated with correctness, and in as a =
not materially, deﬁcient in perspicuity and interest. , p 1 .
