f these inferior divinities or idols, are the avowed

In order to conciliate their favor, or avoid their Wrath, the de-
ften use the most ridiculous and odious rites,

luded worshippers 0 _ .
endure manv voluntary tortures. or plunge into all the abomina—

tions of vicious indulgence. The number of these idols cannot
be computed. The Hindoos alone make their boasts of more
than 300 millions. Besides many idolatrous images, there 13

mal, insect, or vegetable, which is not superstitiously adored in
Asia, instead of Jehovah, the true God. The religion, however,
of these people is, to a great extent, mere Atheism, and found~

ed on a belief in the eternity of matter.

‘The Asiatics are remarkable for the obstinacy and tenacity
with tvhich they cling to their ancient superstitions, and indeed
to their customs and manners generally. Their style of build~
ing, the fashions of their dress, their forms of civility, their
amusements, occupations, and habits, have changed but little
for many ages. In each nation, they dress, a pear, live, and
act. much as they did thousands of years are. ' hey staaifase
