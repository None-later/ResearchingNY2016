tooling name, was the am-in Ira mm
pears to have been founded in 1 limit: »
{ectto Argos, but was seized upon and ’

rived in Greece. The Phoeiiicians were _enterpr_is-
ing navigators, and became early acquainted with
the shores of the Mediterranean sea. Iiiachus,
their leader, founded a city which he called Argos,
atadistaiice of about twenty miles from the re-
sent town of Napoli. Upon this early eriot of
r Grecian history, the fancy of the pools of tlint nation
 has luxuriated. According to their accounts, the
primitive Grcciaiis wandered lawless in the woods,
clothed in the skins of the beasts on which they
fed, and occasionally eating the ﬂesh of the pn-
soiicrs llIt‘._y took in war.

The fabulous histories state that Uranus came
to Greece from Egypt or Pliuanicia. He became
king, and had a _liimil of riniits called Tituiis,
who robelletl against t cir athcr, dethroned him
and their brother Saturn, and reigned in their
stead. Jupiter, who was saved and brought up
Rf Crete, tlnally_coni_iuerod the Titans and divided
but dominion: with illl brothers Pluto and Neptune.
His palace was at mount Olympus.
