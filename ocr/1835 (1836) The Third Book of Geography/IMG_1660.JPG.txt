that he never found this eau de vie. The
dynasty of Him, after lasting, under twenty-

called the II;:oii—l_lan dynasty. China was
divided into three einpircs, governed by
branches of the sixth dynasty, which divi-

ended 420 years A. C. This was called
the dynasty of Tcin-ou-ti, and included
tilteen emperors.

power over all the members of his family,
whom, however, he had no authority to put

all. Each district was governed by a
mandarin, who had absolute power over
the inhabitants, but could not inﬂict capital
punishment without the concurrence of

the emperor. _ _
