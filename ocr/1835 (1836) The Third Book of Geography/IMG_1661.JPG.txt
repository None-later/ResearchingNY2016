while they were overwhelmed with guilt
and grief. For their sake the earth was
cursed, and its tillage was a work of the
hardest labor. The guilty pair were ex-

were planted in their frames, thence to be

bond shalt thou be in the earth. Cain then
went from the presence of the Lord into
the land ofNod, in which he built a city,
called after his son Enoch, to the east of
Canaan?‘ The murder of Abel occurred,
as is supposed, about one hundred and
thirty years after the creation of the world.

12. During this time, Adam and Eve
became doubtless the parents of mrmy
children, and after the death of Abel, they
had a numerous offspring, the eldest child
ofwhom was Seth. The descendants of
Seth, from his and their piety, were called
the ‘children of God,’ while the wicked-
ness, turbulence and impiety of the de-
scendants of Cain procured for them the
name of the ‘children of men.’
