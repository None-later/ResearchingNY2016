The practice of our colleges ' . . _
that to teach well it is l'l(‘,('/t':'is‘Su[‘y in trike :1 ivcn period of time, and lay
out at definite course of study tor the pcriot . In the auth0r’s school, this
period is twenty—oiic weeks. This history is intended to be studied in two
such ieriods ; Ancient and Middle History in one, and Modern History in
the ot er.* It is customary to hegiii with ancient history. In many instan-
ces this takes all the time which the pupil can devote to this branch of
study. It is true that by so heginniii v we go from causes to effects; but
this con:-iidcrzition, seems to he overba unced by the fact that every man

is necessarily the centre of’ his own system, and acquires the most useful
knowled e when helearns that which is most nearly connected
Hence, i but one of the two could be studied, the preference should be iv-
an to the Modern History. Although expecting that both will be studied
in my school, I have still wished to liuve :1 workiso arranged that the study
may, at the option of the iozuzlier, he begun with the Modern, as it might
prevent the necessity oi‘ forrning two r:Ia’so-os in any one term.
