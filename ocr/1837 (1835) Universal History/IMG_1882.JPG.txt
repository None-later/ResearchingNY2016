CHAPTER I.

T HE face of the whole earth, with a few exceptions, is now known.
T he family of man is divided by natural distinctions, into different
races; and by the boundaiy lines of the countries which they in.
habit, into different nations, each governed by its own peculiar laws.

If we take a series of maps representing the entire world, and
inquire concerning the length of time which the nations it now pre.
sents, have been known, we shall ﬁnd in looking back to different
periods, that by degrees, their names and places disappear.

In 1491, A. D., the whole continent of America was, as to those
from whom we derive the knowledge of history, as though it were
not. A little before the birth of our Saviour, Great Britain, the land
of our ancestors, was unknown, as was the whole of the northern
part of Europe, the southern part of Africa, and the eastern part of
Asia. If we go back ﬁfteen hundred years from the Christian aria,
no traces of inhabitants are to be found on the face of the earth,

except a few comparatively small nations, around the eastern extrem-
ity of the Mediterranean Sea..*
