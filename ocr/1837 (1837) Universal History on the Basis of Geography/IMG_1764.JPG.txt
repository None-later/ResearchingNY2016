it  t PREFACE.

Tun idea oi’ emhracxiig in the compass of these two little volumesyacy thing him
a tolerable outline of Universal History, would doubtless excite a smile on the lip
of a college professor, should he ever coridescend to peep into our humble title-page.
But let my object be clearly understood, and I hope the attempt I have here made
may not be deemed either ridiculous or presuming.

A work which gives in de,ail the history of mankind, must necessarily be volumi-
nous. It is 'therei'ore beyond the utmost stretch of the youthful intellect to eompass
it; the young reader shrinks back in despair, even from undertaking the task of its
perusal. He looks upon the formidable row of octaves, in which such a wilderness
of lore is collected, as a maze in which he is sure to get lost, and he therefore
prudently resolves to keep clear oi it. V

Abridgments of general history have been usually liable to still greater objections.
They are little more than dry lists of dates, presenting no pictures to the imagination,
exciting no sympathies in the heart, and imparting few ideas to the understanding.
If, by dint of labor, a meagre chronological table is extracted by the reader, and fixed
in the memory,  is of no practical use. It is but‘a skeleton, without flesh, sinews, or
soul : a mass of words, to which the mind can assign no clear deﬁnitions.

And yet it is very desirable that every person should, at an early period of life, have
imprinted on his mind, in bright and unfailing colors, a clear outline of the story of
mankiiid, from its beginiiiiigiit the plain of Shinar, down to the present hour. The
advantages of this are obvious. It makes all ‘subsequent reading and reflection on the
Iuhject of history both useful and interesting; it becomes a stimulus to research; it
is ever after a thread to guide the inquirer through the labyrinths of historical lore.

The task of preparing a work which may accomplish this desirable object in respect
to the young‘, is doubtless diflicult. To steer clear of bewildering diﬂliseness omthe
one hand, and repulsive chronological brevity on the other——the Scylla and Charyhdia
which beset the adventurer -n this atteinpt-—and at the same time to weave into tr Kev;
pages, a clear, vivid and continuous tale of the great human family-—oiie that may be
both comprehensible and entertaining to the young readei-v—-deinands a nicer antler-
atanding of the youthful heart and intellect, and more art inlthe adaptation of lan-
guage to simple minds, than can often be at the command of any man. But thnueh
