pupil by every available art. I wish him to read, and as he reads,.to think and feel.
It he does this, he will gain a knowledge of events, and extract useful lessons from
them, and thus the end I have desired will be attained. .

There is one feature of the Work upon which I wish to add a few remarks. Before
giving the history of any country, I tell the reader where it is; I give him a sketch of
its present condition; I direct his attention to its place on the map, and ask him to
observe its position in relation to other places. Having thus given the country a
"local habitation and a name,” in the mind of the reader, I proceed to relate its story.
Thus it will be seen that I have made Geography the basis of History; :1 point of
much importance, as I think, in teaching this subject to children. In a larger work

it is less necessary, for it may be presumed that older readers are acquainted vzitt
