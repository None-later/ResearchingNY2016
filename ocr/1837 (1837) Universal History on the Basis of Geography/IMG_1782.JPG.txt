ASSY RYA. 

2. This region,,_receiv_ed the name of Assyria. 
was the ﬁrst. of tlfe nations of the earth. Its boundl-

ries varied at different times, but its place on the map
may be seen in the vicinity of the two rivers T1513

and Euphrates, northward of the Persian Gulf.
3. Ashur, the grandson of Noah, was the first rule:

of Assyria. In the year 2229 B. C. he built the 
of Nineveh, and surrounded it with walls 3 hllﬂdmd
feet high. Itiwas likewise defended by ﬁfteen hun-
dred towers, each two hundred feet ‘in height. 
city was so large that 2!. person would have travelled a
hundred miles merely in walking round it.
4. Biiit the city of Babylon, which was built 8. Ihﬂ!
time afterwards, was superior to Nineveh both in size
and beauty. It was situated on the river Euphrates!
The walls were so very thick that six chariots drawn
by horses could be driven abreast upon the top, with-
out danger of falling off on either side. In this ebull-
try we do not surround our cities with walls; but in
ancient times walls were necessary to protect the
people from their enemies.

5..=‘In this city there were magniﬁcent 
belonging to the royal palace. They were mn-
structed in such a manner that they appeared to h
