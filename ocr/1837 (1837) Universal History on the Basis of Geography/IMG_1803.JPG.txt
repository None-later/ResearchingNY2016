so fmnous for his gi-<=:st l'i('i|(‘5 that to this day we say,
“As 1‘i<:h us Cru:.s‘11.s'.” But, in spite of his wealth, he
was conquered by Uyrurs, king; of l’er:~;i:t, 5118 B. C.

Asi:LMino1‘,continued subject to the l’«-.rsinn empire
till the time of Alexander, about 330 B. C., when it
was conquered by that famous lender.

15. Three hundred years before Christ, Pontus,
which [and once been a part of Lydia, became an in-
dependent country. It continued to ﬂourish for many
ye-urs, and Mithridntes VII. successfully maintained a
war with the Romans for a long time.
