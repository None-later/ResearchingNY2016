CHAPTER CI.—-Ennorn cotrrnmnn.

Sequel Qf the Turkish history.

1. Tm; reigns of most of the Turkish Sultans have
been full of crime and bloodshed. Sultan Selim, who

began to reign in 1512, invaded Egypt, and conquered ,

it. The Egyptian soldiers were called Mamelukes,
of whom I have told you in the history of Egypt.
Thousands of them were taken prisoners.
~~ 2. After the victory, the sultan ordered a splendit’
throne to be erected on the banks of the river Nile,
near the gates of Cairo. Sitting on this throne, he
caused-all the Mamelukes to be massacred in his sight,
and their bodies to be thrown into the river.

3. Mohammed the Third, who ascended the throne
in 1596, had nineteen brothers. All these he count!

to be strangled, so that they mi ht n t tt i to rob
him of his power. 8 O a em“
