6. The Chinese ladies are chieﬂy remarkable for tip‘
little feet. A grown woman in China is able to Vii-1"
lmaller shoes than a young child in America. But tliieii
feet are kept merely for show, and are almost good ﬁn
nothing to walk with.

7. Religion among the Chinese is in a very sad condi.
tion. The people are given up to idolatry. Almost all
religions are tolerated, although but little reverence is paid
to any. There are more temples than can be easily
numbered.

8. When a Chinese wishes to be married, he buys a A

wife of her parents, but he is not permitted to see her till
she is sent home. The youn I lady is brought to her hus-
band’s door in a pzilankeen. ﬁle puts aside the curtains of
the palankoen, and peeps in at his new wife. If he does
not like her looks, he sends her back again.

9. In China there are some very singular punishments.
Sometimes a wooden frame, weighing two hundred pounds,
is put round a man’s neck. He is compelled to carry it
about with him wherever he goes; and-, so long as he
wears it, he can neither feed himself, nor lie down.

10. One of the most curious customs of China is that of
excluding all foreigners from the country. A few Ameri-
can and European merchants are permitted to reside at
Canton, but they are ‘obliged to leave their wives at
Macao. No other strangers are permitted in the kingdom.
The people think that their manners and customs are the

best in the world, and they do not wish foreigners to come 1,
and introduce new notions. The)’.   ation 3;
