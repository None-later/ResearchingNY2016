Review of the History of Jlsia.

1. Lu‘ us now go back and review the history of Asia
In this quarter of the globe, the most wonderful events if,

3. It was in Asia, that the religion which teaches us

that there is one only living and true God had its origin;
and here Jesus Christ appeared, to establish this religion,
id seal the truth of revelation with his blood.
 « 4:. It was in Asia, that Mahomet corpmenced and estab-
lished his religion, which is now believed by more tliﬁn
halt‘ the human race. Several other religions had their
origin in Asia.

5. In Asia, some of the greatest empires have existed,
of which history gives us any account. The Assyrian
3 , em ire, as I have before said, is the first on record-
. i This was followed by the Persian empire, which seemed '

to swallow up all the surrounding nations. China, thﬁ

most populous empire on the globe, has endured longer
than any other.

, many countries, had their origin in ‘ Asia. The Turk!»

11. But in Asia it IS not so. \Vlioever is king, the

people are but slaves. Education makes no progress,‘
liberty is unknown, truth is little valued, virtue is
prized, and that thing which we call comﬁort, and whiﬁ 9 ;

makes our homes so dear to us, is not to be fonndin ' ; *
