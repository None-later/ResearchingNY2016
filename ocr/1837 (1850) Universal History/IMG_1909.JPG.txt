PREFACE.

-———

Universal history, as a cience, isvgreat in itself, grea. t in its conso-.  ‘
quences on human conduct and happiness; and, at this moment, particu-

larly important to the citizens of our republic. .
The belief, that much experience in imparting knowledge would ena-
ble the author so to arrange and illustrate this vast subject, as to make it

less diiiicult to acquire and retain, was the moving spring which at first

produced this work, and which now presents it to the public in an_iin-
proved form. This volume oﬂers, in the combinations of the sub_iect-

matter, and the arrangement by which it is presented, some original fea-
tures; and in its illustrations, we believe it will be found to solve the

problem, what is the best form of presenting the grand outline of chro-
nology. We refer, for this solution, to the plan, of which a sketch is 
presented in the frontispiece: and which we call the Temple of Time; 
and to the enlarged view of the ﬂoor-worlt of this Temple, contained 
in the Chart of “the Course of Time, or Picture of Nations.” Here is 
addressed to the eye, on a small scale, a plan strictly scientiﬁc, (perspec-
tive being an exact science,) which is to the whole of history, as it exists
in time, what a small map of the world, with its few lines of latitude and
longitude, is to the same science as it exists in  If but few cities
are set down on snch.a map, whoever understands geography, having
any other city given with its latitude and longitude, can refer it to its true
situation on the map, and thus know its position relative to other places.
Such will our Temple of Tina be, in respect to the dates of events to
those who understand it; and persons already acquainted with history
comprehend it at a glance. Such a help, the most profound and culti-
vated mind need not despise; for how often does it occur, that the con-
templation of characters and events as they exist with other; heron 0,-
‘n“ ‘hem: 10868 to profound conclusions, concerning the causes and
consequences of man’s conduct and destiny. But to learn such a method
in youth,  become accustomed thus to refer all events to a vhibla
