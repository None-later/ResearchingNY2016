lV PREFACE.

The repeated requests, that they mi

use our work in their schools, have led to their preparation,

tain, especially those which relate to the middle ages,

historically interesting, not easily found on other maps,
In the written work, an attempt has been made t

proper relative proportions. The painter allows g

‘ I as those obyects recede into the distance.
Such is equally the order of nature in regard to objects as they exist in

timr-. Yet the mountain which is distant must have more room in the
picture than the dark valley that lies near. Thus tower Greece and Rome,

amid the dimness of antiquity, and thus sink the dark ages, though nearer
to the foreground.

There are two methods between which, in a book for reading, not for
reference merely, the writer must choose; the ethnographical, by which
nations are separately described, and the chronographical, by which the
order of time is strictly preserved. When writers of universal history

follow the etlinographical method, the reader is naturally led to consider
contemporary events as consecutive, and to seek for some plan by which
they may be placed together. This is to produce the chronographical
arrangenient which he is apt to think should have been followed by the
writer. On the other hand, where the chronographical method prevails,
the reader complains of a confusion arising from mingling together the

histories of different nations,—~selects the scattered parts belonging to each,

and having put them together, produces the ethnographical plan. He
now thinks that, because he has come to a good understanding of the sub-

ject, his method alone is good; not reflecting that he has had the advan-
tages of both. The truth appears to be, that history cannot be well under-
stood, unless the reader can, with the one method, trace every great nation
by itself through all its most important changes, and with the other, con-
ceive liimsell placed in any of the most noted periods of time, and glance
through the whole range of contemporary events.

For such a comprehension of the subject, we refer to the illustrations
already noticed; where we have at the same glance both methods pre-
sented to the eye. In the text, we have pursued either, or combined both,
as the occasion seemed to require. When a nation has had little connec-
tion with other nations, its history has been treated separately. When
several nations have been blended, by reason of their relations with each
other, as in case of war, their history, for the time, has also been thrown
together.

To make this book easy: to teachers, questions are placed at the foot of
each page. By the manner in which these are put, passages of history
which, from the imperfection of language, cannot be clearly expressﬁd
with the brevity to which our limits conﬁne us, are made perSpICl10U5-
