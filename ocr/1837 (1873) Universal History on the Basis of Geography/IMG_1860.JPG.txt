they sought to take his life. ’

3_ They brought him before the judgment-seat of
Pontius Pilate, who was then the Roman governor of
Judea. Pilate sentenced him to death, and the Saviour

of the world was cruciﬁed between two thieves. He»

days, and ascended into heaven!

length of the Medite

rranean Sea.
