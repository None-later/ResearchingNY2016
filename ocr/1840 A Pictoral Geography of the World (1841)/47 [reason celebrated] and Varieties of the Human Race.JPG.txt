in the skull; color and nature
of the hair; &c. Some nat-
uralists, taking complexion as
the basis of their division, dis-
tinguish the human race into
three Varieties; 1. the white
or Caucasian; 2. the yellow
or Mongolian; and 3. the
black or Ethiopian. Others
adopt the form of the skull as
the characteristic, and make
five Varieties; 1. the Cauca-
sian, including the European
nations and some of the. West-
ern Asiatics, in which the
head is almost round, the face
oval, and the features not Very
prominent; 2. The Mongo-
lian, in Which the head is
almost square, the cheek-bones
prominent, and the face broad
and ﬂattened ; 3. The Ethio-
pian or Negro, in which the
head is narrow, the forehead
convex, the nostrils wide, the
jaws lengthened, the lower
part of the face projecting, the
nose spread and flat, and the
lips thick ; 4. The American,
in which the cheek-bones are
prominent, the face broad, the
forehead low, and the eyes

deeply seated ; 5. And the
Malay, in which the forehead
is slightly arched, 
jaw projecting, and the pfeatgyea .
