tiamtv tcztclics, that the Mt:-ssialt, pronnsctl by

the Jcwisli proplu.-ts, has come, and brought
a new revelation to men, and that Jesus Christ
is this .\lcssial1 ; the New Testament contains
the revelations of this divine Teacher.

Among all the religions of ancient and
modern times, there is none which will bear
the test of a rational investigation, except
Christianity. This is the only system which
can pretend to a divine origin, and the only
one to which mankind can look for a remedy
against the various moral evils which are seen
to pervade every branch of the great human

Greece, Hungary, and part of Turkey. The
Roman Catholic, Latin, or Western church, maintains the supremacy of the Pope, prevails
in many parts of Europe, and has a considerable number of followers in North America.

‘New AT.efstament as their guide. They are divided into many sects, of which the principal
areLutheraas, Methodists, Presbyterians, Episcopalians, Congregationalists, Baptists, Qua-
lcers, Unitarians, and Universalists. The Protestant religion, in its various forms, prevails
in the United States, England, Scotland, Wales, Holland, and some other European coun-
ries.
