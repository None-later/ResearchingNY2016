bary is, “Peace be with you.” Merchandise is measured by the arm, from the elbow. The
females when they would honor a person, as the emperor, raise sudden and piercing shrieks,
and the manners and customs, generally, are those of a very rude state of society.

The Jews in Barbary are a numerous and much oppressed class. The house of a Jew,
and all its sacred relations, is open to every Moor who will violate it. A Jew may be beaten
by men, and pelted by boys. ' When riding he is forced to dismount, if he meet a Moor; to
make humble obeisance to one of distinction, and to walk with bare feet in cities. Even the
females are compelled to do this. The Jews perform most of the trades, and monopolize the
commerce. They form the only industrious class in cities. In no other country are they so
much depressed as in Morocco ; iet here they are distinguished for being well formed, and
the females are considered as some of the most beautiful in the world. _

The Arabs chieﬂy occupy the plains, and they exhibit the same. pastoral and migratory
habits, the same simplicity of manners, and the same union of hospitality and plunder, that
characterize their countrymen in Arabia ; they live in tents, a numbercf which forms a camp
under a sheik, and several camps often acknowledge a chief, called einir. _

Some of the Berbers or Brebers have the same migratory habits as the Arabs ; their food
consists of camel’s milk and dried camel’s ﬂesh, that animal constituting their S018 Wealth-
They wear woolen gowns which cover but a part of the body, and sometimes leather Calla“

woolly substance, obtained from the date palm. . 1 I follow an the Ordi_
