dering pastoral tribes live in tents. The food is generally plain and simple, and the general
population temperate and abstemious. Coffee is almost a necessary of life, and many tribes
live almost entirely from the produce of ﬂocks and herds. The Koords eat a bread made of
acorns: The most common spirituous liquor is arrack, and it is often drunk to intoxication. Few
£eople are addicted to opium. The diseases are of almost every kind that are common in

urope. In sandy districts, ophthalmia is common, and the plague commits ravages in cities.

contract, or rather by tribute: on the routes of the chief cities, even asliiar as from Constantino-
ple to Bagdad, but these are not to be had by travelers, unless they put themselves under the
care of a Tartar courier, who goes with despatches. For a certain sum, the courier takes

and marble. The tomb of Ilns is a high, conical tumulus, of a remarkable size. Other im-. e V
mense tumuli bear, somewhat douhtfuliy, the names of Hector, Prism, and Paris. Near Alex-e 
andria Troas, which is full of antiquities, is a granite column, nearly 38 feet long, and 5 feet 3.. ' T
inches in diameter. The enormous masses of the aqueduct of Herodes Atticus, the  »-
