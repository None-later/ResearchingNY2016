Sepulchrc of the Kings.

Jerusalem. On tl1e.east of Mount Zion, is the pool of Siloam. It is under an arched vault
of masonry. In the valley of J ehoshaphat are ediﬁces called the tombs of Zachariah, of Abra-
ham, and of Jehoshaphat. The pool of Bethesda remains with its original facing of large stones.
At Bethlehem, a convent built by Helena marks the spot of the I’tedeemer’s birth. The edi-
ﬁce has been so often repaired, that it contains probably few of the original materials. Nonelof
the consecrated places are pointed out with so much certainty as the spot of the Nativity ‘; and
of this spot, which is worn by the feet of pilgrims, there is no ground for skepticism’.

10. History. The name of Palestine seems to be derived from the ancient Philistines, but
the country is more commonly known in Scripture ﬁrs: as the Promised Land and the Land
of Canaan, and afterwards, when oc.c;upied by the 12 tribes of Israel, as Judea. The people
of the Phaanician States, on the northeast, ‘were early wealthy and commercial, and were
generally on friendly terms with the Israelites, while the people of Syria were generally ‘hos-
tile. At a later period,’—alZl thesettregions were c.onq;uemd~ by t‘;h®lBal_ry'l0Dianvs» the Pemlansa
