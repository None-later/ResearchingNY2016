is the number of caps, which sometimes
amounts to 15. The poor, l"10\VC\’C1‘, Wear
but 2, and their chief clothing is a linen cloth
round the middle, and a woolen one over the
shoulders. This also serves them for the
covering at night; though sometimes they
sleep in bags, for protection from insects.

in their cloak. The Arabian females stain their eyelids with a dark substance, and their cheeks
and hands with a yellow C‘Ol0I‘. The language is the Arabic, but it is not sp'ol<.en in its ancient
