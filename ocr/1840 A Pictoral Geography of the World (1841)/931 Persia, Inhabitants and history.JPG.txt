’l‘he royal palace, or the Takh-em
Jtmt.s‘}tctd, Consists of a number
of supvrh buildings, forming both
a ptilum; of ample magnitude, and
a citadel or bulwark for the capi-
tal, on a situation of the most com-
manding aspect. It consists of an
ttrtilicial platform, 1,426 feet long
by 802 broad, on the south, and
926 feet on the north side, chis-
eled out oft: muunmiu, and liming,‘ u lti3.;lwr part of the same mountain connected with its east-
ern side, the other three Sl(i(.‘S prusent.iug perpendicular precipices from the subjacent plain. On
my nmuntaius to the vast, called by Diodorus the royal mount, and which still preserves the
muuo Slut]:-lm/a, or royal mount, are the tombs of the kings, excavated in the rock. The only
mg’ to the summit is by an ttsctmt of steps on the western thee, forming a double ﬂight. The
SW23 are broml and .~:h:tllow, 10, and S0lllt‘litl1(.‘S 1--1, being; cut out of one block of marble. So
easy is the ttsvottt, that (3 lmrsotuvn tnaty ride abreast to the top of the platform. Niebuhr de-
clares this staircase to be the most splendid, sublime, and durable ever reared by human hands,
nmn_y of the stones being 27 feet long, and many on the wall 55 feet long by from4 to 6 feet
higli. (ln retteliing the platform, the first objects that meet the eye are 2 colossal bulls, of a
noble liirttratttl flllltlltit‘, sculptured on the lofty sides of an enormous portal. Other symbolical
mpmstttztttttotts tn grranito, in basso-relieve, are found in different places. On a near approach
to the hall ol‘coltmuts, the eye is riveted by the grandeur and beautiful decorations of the double
stttirmtse, \\‘ltlt.‘ll leads up to them. Beyond this, and rising from the landing-place, is another
double staircase, but smaller; the windings of these staircases are covered with sculptures -of
htttmttt ilg,‘tll‘GS, and a duplicate representation of a combat between abull and a lion. What ~
ttrttst sculpturutl ‘tilt’? nfonderlitl procession on the winding walls of the staircase is unknown, but .’
it seems to he ot V|i()l!‘al¥ workmausltip. At any rate, the finishing of the parts, and the grace V
and truth oi: the ‘lmss-t‘eltel“.s, proclaim a retinement worthy of the master Chisels of Greece. As
for the p.latl-erut ttseli, nothing can be more striking than the View of its ruins ; so vast, so mag-
mttcettt. so fallen, so mutilated, and silent. But every object is as desolate as it is beautiful ;

awakening; the most poignant feelings, that a pile of such indefatigable labor, such complicated, ,

iingfeatzitvt should be left untenanted and unnoticed. in the desert, or if noticed, be doomed to
