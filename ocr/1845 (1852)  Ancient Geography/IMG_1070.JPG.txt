3. Biibylonia formed a province of the Ass ' ' -

Ni'nus, when it became an independent State. The \'n0iﬁ)trtei(?.;‘(lﬂ();‘l:sflil\‘) of

was Nol_iiicliadiio7.’ziir; his dominioiis comprised Babylonia Mcso wings

and Syri:i,incli1ding Phoenicia and the kingdom of Judah. l3elsha1i’:arniii:
granclson, i_ind_thc last Babylonian monarch, was subdued by Cyrus  C
538, and his kingdom was added to the Persian empire. ’ '

4. The Biibylonians were a partially civilized nation 2000 years B C
Twelve hundred years later, the Chalduaans, or Kasdim, either conqueieii
or became incorporated with them. The priests were renowned for their
skill in astronomy and astrology; commerce and manufactures were on.
courrigcd, and great wealth was acquired. Marriages were usually made
by pureliase, and the sick were exposed in the streets to receive the advice
of the passers-by.

5. The religion of the Babylonians was Sabianism, or the worship of the
sun, moon, and stars. Their supreme deity wa_s.Ba/al, or Bel, and was sup.
posed to personity the sun: Mylit'ta was the principal female divinity; her
worship was gross and liccntious. Cruelty and obscenity were the most
InIlI‘l(t‘(l attributes of Babylonian as well as of Assyrian idolatry. Human

victims were sacriﬁced, and the most obscene practices enjoined as a reli-

gious duty.
6. Biibyloii, the capital, stood on both sides of the Euphrates river; it

was the first city that was founded after the ﬂood, and was one of the most
iiiiigiiilicciit of ancient times. It was 60 miles in circuit, with walls 200
ciibits high and 50 thick, and a hundred gates of brass. Among its most
rciiowned structures, were the temple of Be’lus and the Hanging Gardens.
The former, originally, it is believed, the tower of Ba’bel, was an eighth of
a mile in diameter at the base, and 600 feet high: it consisted of eight sto.
ties, gradually diminishing as they ascended; 3. sloping terrace on the outside
of the building served as a means of ascent and descent.

7. The Bubylonians having provoked a war with the Medes and Persians,
Cyrus laid siege to the capital, but the citizens, confiding in the strength
of their walls, laughed their enemies to scorn. At length, during a grand
festival, when the besieged probably relaxed their wonted vigilance, Cyrus
diverted the waters of the Euphrates into an artiﬁcial channel, marched his
troops by night through the dried-up bed of the river into the city, and

overcame all opposition.
