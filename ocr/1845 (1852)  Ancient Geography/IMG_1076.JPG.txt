6. The principal lakesof In-terior Lib’ya were, the Nigri’tes, Chelon'i'des,
and I_.ib'ya. The latter is supposed to be Lake Tchad. Various towns are
nientioned by_Ptolemy, but none of. them can now be recognised. Nigfm-
Metropolis, dGira-Metropolis, Is’cheri, Tagama, and Thuppae, are some of
those name .

7. The Mandrus, Caphas, and Thala, were mountains supposed to form a
portion of the great chain that is now known to extend across Africa from
east to west. That part in which the Nile was supposed to rise,~was called
by Ptolemy the Lu’nee Montes (Mountains of the Moon), and the name is
still retained.

8. THE Foiirum’-rs: INSULJE, or FORTUNATE ISLANDS, now the Canaries,
derived their names from their delightful climate, and the abundance of
their ﬁne fruits, and other products. The ancients described them in the
most exaggerated terms, and believed them to be the islands of_ the blessed,
or Elysium. Centu’ria lay nearest the African coast; Cana'ria was noted
for its larrre dogs and Purpifriae for its purple dye. Niva'ria is now Tene-
riﬁ‘e. Itsb lofty peak is always covered with snow; hence the name of the
island. Hi'ero or Ferro was the most western of these islands. The ancient
geographers chose it as, the first meridian. They reckoned their longitude
from it; and it is still occasionally used for_that purpose. Further south,
was the island of Cer’ne. Here Hanno, in his celebrated voyage of disco-

‘ very, planted a Carthaginian colony ; it was long held by that people as a.
A commercial depot.

ETHIOPIA, OR, ETHIO'PIA INTERIOR.

9. ETHIO'PIA INTERIOR was the most remote part of Africa
known to. the ancients. The inhabitants were called 1Ethi'opes
Anthropoph’agi. They were a race of cannibals. Here some
geographers place Agyzymba; a country of which nothing more
isxlmown than that it was reported to be the southern limits of a

-*Roman expedition. Others suppose it to be the country now

called Ag’ades, or Agdass, an oasis on the Southern edge of the
