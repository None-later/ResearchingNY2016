6. Palestine “is a land of hills and valleys” (Deut. xi. 11);" it is

traversed by two ranges ‘of mountains, one on the western, and
the other on the eastern side of the river Jordan. Of these

tains Leb’anon is the highest; Her’mon, Gil’ead, and Car’
the next most noted.

7. Leb’anon is a magniﬁcent mountain, and is always covered with
snow. Its height and grandeur, and the fertility of’ its valleys, are often
alluded to by the Hebrew writers. It was famed for its

_ ﬁne cedar trees
but they are now, as predicted by the prophet (Isa. x. 19), nearly all de:
at yed. These trees were the resort of eagles (Ezek. xvii. 3),

and the lofty
summits of Lebanon, as well as the adjacent mountains, were the haunts
of ‘ lions and leopards. (Sol. Song iv. 8.)

8. Eastward of the Jordan are the mountains of Her’mon

, Ba’shan, Gi1’ead,
and Ab'arim. The summits of Her’mon,

like those of'Leb’anon, are covered

9. Ba’sha.n and Gil'ead were famous for their rich pastures, and the abun.
