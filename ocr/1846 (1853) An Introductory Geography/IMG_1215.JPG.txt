Progression is among the original laws of our being. The eye is not satisﬁed

turns: to be a learner, seeking new sources of knowledge—eager to push his
researches into new ﬁelds of discovery ; and though he may not expect to become

a Newton or 11 Looks, he may become a “learned blacksmith,” or at least an intel-
ligent and useful citizen.

nothing that it cannot understand? We answer, very

possible use could it serve?

.. The evils which have resulted from this defect in education, are of the worst

kind. The loss of time already alluded to, is the least of them. N01‘ is EVE“ the
loss of knowledge the greatest of them. For the very disposition to know, theyery
desire of acquisition is taken away. Much of the ignorance of the community is
to be traced to this kind of learning. How many dull scholars, too, have been
made so by unintelligible instruction? The abused mind still gives this testimony
to its intrinsic dignity, that it cannot be interested in what it does not understand.
Words that neither teach nor signify any thing to it must be dull; they ought to
be dull. It is, and it ought to be, a dull business to commit them to memory, and
to repeat them, though with ever so much ﬂuency and eclat."
mom THE JOURNAL or xnucnrox.

A writer in this work speaks of an examination of a class in geography, which
astonished the spectators by the readiness and ﬂuency of their answers. A person
present happening to ask one of the class, a bright little fellow, “ Where Turkey
is i" (a question not in his book,) he replied, “Turkeyl why ! in the yard, among

the poulta.”
ANECDOTE or Jorm norms: rooxz.

The effect produced on the learner by this mode of teaching, is admirably illus-
trated by nn anecdote of the celebrated John Home Tooke. When at 
he was one day asked by the master, why a certain verb governed
