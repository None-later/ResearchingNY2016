bring his iiiiagiiiatioii to the aid of his understanding,
the main 1‘cat.1ii-cs of the lessons are also pictorially
presented in a series of numerous designs exquisitely
drawn and engraved, that while they serve to instruct,
they may also contribute to elevate and reﬁne the taste
of the pupil. This feature of the work Will be duly
appreciated by every teacher who has had occasion to
lament the 1’URPOSEL'ESS CARICATURES that deform many
of our class-books, and Waste the attention of scholars.
Small portions of descriptive Geography are likewise
iiitroduccrl, at desirable intervals, as a means of relaxa-
Q tion to the student. The maps are clear and large, and
as the studies progress, throughout the Series, are
