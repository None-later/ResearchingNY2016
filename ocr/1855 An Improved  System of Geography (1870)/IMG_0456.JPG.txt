Asia is noted for its high mountains, its great rivers,
its extensive table lands, plains and deserts, and for its
%' immense salt lakes or inland seas.

It has every variety of soil and climate, and is distin-
guished for the number and value of its mineral and
vegetable productions.

It contains more than one-half the entire of the popu-
lation of the globe, comprising three distinct 1-aces, viz. :
the Caucasian, the Mongolian and the Malay.

The people who occupy the western portion of Asia
belong to the Caucasian race; those of Central and
Eastern Asia are principally Mongols with a few Malays. :

There has been very little change, since the earliest
times, in the institutions or the manners and customs
of the Asiaties. The governments are despotic.
