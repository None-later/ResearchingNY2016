 AFRICA.

Africa is noted for its immense deserts, extensive
table lands and torrid climate.

Owing to its burning climate and savage inhabitants,
‘ and its want of deep bays and navigable rivers, this
country has never been wholly’ explored, and much of
the interior is entirely unknown.

The vegetable productions are abundant and various.
The gigantic baobcb, the teak, acacia, mangrove, ebony,
cocoa-nut, the date and the oil-palm abound in the
forests. Tropical fruits and other products are also
found in great perfection.

The political divisions of Africa are chieﬂy petty
states, governed in the most despotic manner.

The inhabitants consist of several races, differing
greatly from each other in form, stature and color.

In the north, Moors, Berbcrs, Jews, Turks, Arabs,
Copts, Gallo and Somaulis are found; in the central
{ parts, the negro; and, in the south, the Caﬂre and
} llottentot.

2‘ Agriculture and manufactures are in a very rude
; state. Commerce, on the coasts, is considerable, but is
} ca.rrir- l on entirely by Americans, Europeans and Arabs.
{ The internal traffic is carried on across the Great Desert
E by means of camels.

Of the minerals of Africa very little is known, (johl

BARBARY. ‘

Barbary derives its name from the Berbers, the
original inhabitants of the country, Whose descendants
still inhabit the Atlas Mountains.

Thc cities and the country in their vicinity are in-
habited by the Moors; the remoter districts are occu-
pied by wandering tribes of Arabs, Whose wealth con
sists in their ﬂocks and herds.

The climate in the north is excellent, and the soil
fruitful, yielding all the grains and fruits of S. Europe
in the greatest perfection. The S. and E. parts are
mostly barren.

The foreign commerce is considerable. A large cara-
van trade is also carried on with Central Asia and
Eastern Africa.

The chief manufactures are leather, carpets, dress
fabrics and woolen caps, soap, pottery and saddles.
