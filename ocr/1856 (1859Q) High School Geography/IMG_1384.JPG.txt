It is claimed for this “ High—School Geography ”__.

from the most recent and reliable oﬂicial records. .

These are a few of the prominent features of the system here set forth. .,
There are others hardly less important, but want of space prevents their . l :
enumeration. It is believed that the accompanying Maps also possess superior
claims to consideration; that their design greatly facilitates the pupil’s labors,
and that their execution is free from those perplexing errors and inconsistencies
with the text, which are a fruitful source of annoyance in the most popular
atlases of the day. Further discussion of these points, however, and of the
other advantages which it is claimed that these Maps possess, must be left for
the l’reface of the Atlas, to which the reader is respectfully referred.

The present volume is divided into three parts, to which is added an Ap-
pendix, containing the “ RULES FOR DESCRIBING mm NATURAL DIVISIONS or
LAND AND or Warm, mcwnmc DEFINITION or Tamas, EXAMPLES, E-rc.,"
together with “ Dmncnons FOR Mnmomzme ram Corrrnms or A MAP.” _

Pam‘ I. embraces Descriptive Geography and exercises on the Maps in the

accompanying Atlas. PART II. treats of Mathematical Geography. PART III.
is an outline of Physical Geography. '
