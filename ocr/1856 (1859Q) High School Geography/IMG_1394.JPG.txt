' ’ deﬁcientmm ticle of food; the other grains, except oats, are also Culti\'ute(l to a

limited extent. In feeding their horses, they use barle_v and be:ms
instead of oats.

Inhabitants, etc.-The Arabs are divided into two classes, the dwellers
in the towns, and the inhabitants of the desert; the latter are called
Bedouins. They live in tents and lead a Wandering life. There are
several tribes in Arabia, each independent of the others, and governed
by its own slzcilc or chief. The leading object of industry is the raising
of camels, horses, goats, sheep, etc.

Traveling Facilities.——The caravans of pilgrims and other travelers
who cross the Arabian deserts must buy the protection of the various

tribes through whose territories they pass, as the only means of secur-

ing themselves against robbery and loss of life.

There are regular halting-places in the deserts, where the tents of
travelers are pitched and the camels rest after their day’s journe_v,——the
