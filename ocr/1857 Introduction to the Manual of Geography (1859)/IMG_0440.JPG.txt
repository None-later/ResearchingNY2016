Tmc Nuxomu. GEOGRAPHICAL Smuss heretofore consisted of three grades of textbooks,
vi»: Fms'r LISSON3 IN (inoomxrxrr, the MANUAL, and McN.u.LY’s SYSTEM or GEOGRAPHY.

Aﬂm We years of the most. gmtifyirig success of the Manual, it was deemed advisable to intro.
duoo large and newly engraved maps and illust.rat.ions, together with many important additions to
the Map Exercises; the whole resulting in a work larger, more advanced, and, consequently, more
expensive, than the book in its original form. A
Hence, the space between the Fmsr Lrzssoxs and the Manna; was increased to such an ex.
tent as to warrant. the use of an intermediate work, as an I2\"X‘RODl.“C‘TION TD run MANUAL.

 

This book, while it possesses an advantage in an economical point of view, renders an easier
gradation from the Fmsr Lxssoxs to the Mason; thus _aﬁ‘ording greater facility and satisfaction
to both teacher and pupil.
