that which is most important concerning the (_3‘reograpli_v of the
states and nations or-cilpying the several continents.

In other words, our aim is to give to the pupil whose
(zirciiinstarices in life allow him it complete course of scliolastic
training, that which he most needs as a ba.92'.s' of/u'_«;/2.er Gro-
gyrap/zical stzzdy ,‘ and to i'urnish him, whose opportunities for
school study are limited, a mmlez/3 arounrl which the various
facts in regard to the people and countries of the earth, which
he may in future obtain by miscellaneous readin;’_r, shall :1rrnn,e,'e
tlietnsclves so as permanently to enrich his mind, and, in the
end, impart. to him an enlarged and ititelligeut knowledge of
the eartli and its inliabitants.

The “ (1munon-School Geograpl1y"" is arranged in reference
to the wants and capabilities of classes ave1‘:1.g_rin,<: from nine or
ten to twelve or thirteen years of age. It will be perceived
that this book consists of four distinct parts:

Part. I. being I/zfror/I/ctory Iiessrms ,' Part II. SZu(]_I/ of)‘/z.«.z
(.'oi1tz'2wn./.9,‘ Part III. Stu/Iy qf I/I/’ I7nz'tr.=rl Sz‘r.tte.s,' and Part.
IV. Illat/z.«7m(ttz'mI, or A.s-h'()21.rn27.z'r.'al (}'(—o_r/mp/2_z/. It will be
remarlzed also that the .~:tu(l,\' of‘ each continent consists of three
distiiut Sec-tions:~tlie “.\‘t11rly of the Mup;" the “I’li_vsic:tl
Clmracter of the Continent ; ” and the “ People and Countries "’
l11(:lIId€i«‘.l within it.

It‘ the pupils in whose hands the l:>ool< is placed :i.re.yoI1n{_-‘er
than ten years, or it’ from any cause tliey are less developed
,4. than the average of pupils at that age, their first course of
study should embrace, in Part I., only t/re yirst six lessom ,
i()gUlll€T with Sections 1.. II., IlI., IV., and IX., of the seventh. E
In Part II. their attention would be conﬁned to the “Study of
4 the Map ” in each continent. These subjects require, on the part

of the pupil, simply perception, with the proper use of imaginar
tion and memo7’t , and the study of them can be pursued by
even the very young. This being done, they return to the
beginning of the book, and go through it in course, studying
each portion in the order in which it is there presented.

Part I. and Part II. embrace the entire work properly

belonging to this, the perceptt'1:c grade. The “ Geograpliy of
the United States ” has been added for the sake of those pupils

who will not pursue the study of the subject farther than the
“ Common School Geo ; for it is desirable that they

graphy”
should possess a. fuller knowledge of the Geography of their
own country than could consistently be given them in the :
general st.udy_of the continents.
Astronomical or Mathematical Geography is here presented,
n.°5_ 9/3 belonging properly to this grade, but for the same reason
which caused the addition of the second lessons on the United v
for the next grade. It is there

is diﬂ'ereut from that heretofore presented to the young;
as many things are here treated much more fully than em
before in a text-book for the young; the matter contained in
the “ lo1mnon—S<:-.l1o0l Geograpliy” is equally important and
valuable to the present class of pupils pursuing the study 0;
(}(=,0g‘1'£t.lJlly in our more advaiicetl schools. l t is, in. fact, inch
pensalnle as a prcparatioii for the study of the R11l>J€Ct from ,,
scientiﬁc point of view. These pupils would, however, take
the various portions of the study in a diﬂ"ervnt order from um
in wl;iich the book is zirratiged. Part IV. would he the ﬁg-¢
studied by them. They would then comment’-.e Part I, ,
Lesson lV., omitting the first three lessons, and also the ninth
and eleventh. Part III. would he studied immediately afte,‘
or in place of’, the lessons upon the United States given in
Part Il., under “People and Countries of North Axnericaf‘
In connection with the position and size of each continent, and
of each. country in the continents, the advanced pupils would
be required to give the latitude and longitude of its prominent
points, and its area; while younger pupils would give simply
its relative position and comparative size.

The general plan to be pursued, in presenting to pupils the
various subjects embraced in the “ Connnon-School Geography,’
in.-iy be found in Section I. of the " Teachefs Guide,” entitled
Gift)‘/]7‘(lA])/ethrtl Term/1/7224,]. In Section ll., entitled Prqmzr-aim;
IiIzwm'ses, are suggestions for the illustration of separate l¢:;~;~‘~.on|.
Each lesson should be tliscltssctl with the <_-l:i.<s, in the manna
indicated, before the pupil :=tu<lies it in the text. The olsjecto.’
these exercises will have been made apparent by the <liseusr-ion
