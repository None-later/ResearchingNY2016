there are not navigable waters on the route which is to be
traversed; for goods are more easily carried by water than
over land. Railroads are built in order that the same distance
may be more quickly travelled.

DIFFERENT MODES OF LIFE.

I. Civilized People.—In our own and many other
countries, not only are all those occupations which supply the E
wants of the body carried on with the greatest skill, but great I
care is taken to provide books, schools, and churches, to in-
sti'uct the people ; to make laws which shall order all tlllI];Z‘.5 in
the best manner; and to provide in every way for the welfare
and liappiness of all. The people of such countries are called
Ci’L"i'[’i5€d people.

I]. Savag'es.——In some parts of’ the World the people
live in huts covered With twigs of trees, or with sl/ins.

They obtain their food almost entirely from the wild fruits
of the earth, and the ﬂesh of wild animals; and clothe them-
selves With skins. They, therefore, rarely carry on any of

these occupations, except ﬁshing. They are all hunters. Such
people are called savages.
