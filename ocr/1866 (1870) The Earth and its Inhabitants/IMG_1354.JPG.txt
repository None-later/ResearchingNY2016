PEOPLE AND COUNTRIES OF AFRICA.

L E S S O N I. 3
mi: PEOPLE. 

[_ Neg-roes.——A1"rica is the home of the black and woolly 
haired, or negro race. All that part of the continent south
of the Sahara is occupied by them. Those who inhabit the
moist belt of the continent, called Soudazz, are more civilized
and intelligent, and are of ﬁner form and appearance than
those of other portions. They cultivate the soil, and carry on
some manufactures with considerable skill, but in the greater ;
portion of the continent, the negroes are nearly, or quite savage. ,

II. Whites.—1. The greater part of the Sahara, and the T
region north of it, are occupied by the white race. The native
people, called Berbers, have, however, been conquered by the
Arabs, who came into the country from Arabia, several hun-
dred years ago. The Arabs possess the valley of the Nile,
and most of the Mediterranean coast.

The Berbers are still very numerous, particularly in the
Sahara. They live in the mountainous portions, and in the
Oases, where they cultivate the date groves, and otten build
large cities.

2. The A7-abs of the coast live also in cities, and in the
western part are called Moors. They are the merchants of
the country. Those of the desert do not, like the Berbers,
cultivate the soil, but are a nomadic people. They own large
ﬂocks and herds of sheep, goats, camels, and horses, With which
they wander from one oasis to another, Wherever they can ﬁnd
pasture. They consider themselves the noblemen of the land,
and greatly despise the industrious Berbhrs, and all others who
obtain their subsistence by cultivating the soil.

Companies of Arab merchants are also constantly travelling
over the desert. They go from the coast cities to the princi-
pal towns upon and south of the Sahara, carrying with them
their merchandise, which they exchange for the produce of the
interior. These companies of travellers are called ca/ra/va/ns.

The goods are carried upon the backs of camels.

3. Wandering Berbers.—There are also some wandering tribes of Berbers on
the desert. The Tuaregs on the west, are the principal of these tribes. They watch
for the caravans of Arab merchants, which are frequently crossing the desert from
the  country to Soudan, and require them to pay for the privilege of
crossing their territory. If the travellers do so, they are guided and protected by

which formerly occupied nearly all the region of the Cape of
Good Hope, but are now much reduced in numbers. They
are of a yellowish brown color, somewhat small in size, with
ugly triangular faces. Some of them have been partially civ-
ilized by Christian missionaries. One of their tribes, called
Bushmen, a very miserable and degraded race, are entirely
savage, are great robbers, live in wretched huts and caves, and
feed upon roots and game.

V. Religion.-1. The people of north Africa have not the Bible, but in-
stead of it, a book called the Koran. It was written by a man called Mohammad,
who was born in Arabia, about six hundred years after Christ; and who claimed to
be a prophet, sent by God, as were the prophets of the Bible. His followers are
called Mohammedarhs. They believe in God, but not in our Saviour, as they believe
Mohammed to be the true prophet and teacher, instead of Jesus Christ.

2. The blacks worship serpents and other animals ; idols of wood or stone ; the
spirits of their relations who have died, and other things. ‘They are, therefore,
pagans or heathens.

3. There are now Missionaries in many parts of Africa, and many of the natives
are becoming Christians. They are learning the habits of civilized life, and are
fast improving in character and manners.

COUNTRIES or AFRICA.

There are no such great and powerful states in Africa, as
in the other continents which we have studied. The people
are not sulﬁciently civilized to organize governments capable
of controlling large countries. There are many small IlatiV8
kingdoms; and on diﬁ'e1-ent parts of the coast are colonies 66v
