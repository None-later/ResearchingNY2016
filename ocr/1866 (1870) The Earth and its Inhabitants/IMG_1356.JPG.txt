EASTERN ASIA.——THE CHINESE EMPIRE AND JAPAN.

 

THE people of the great
body of eastern Asia are of
a brownish yelloiv color, with
black eyes, set obliquely, with
straight, black, and thin hair;
and they are of a somewhat
smaller size than the white
race. They have spread from
the plateau of Mongolia, over
all eastern Asia, and are,
tlierefore, often called the
Mongolian race.

The Chinese Em-
pi1'e.—The whole great cen-
tral highland of Asia, and its
eastern slope, together form
the Chinese Empire. This is
in extent the second empire on the globe, its area being about
once and a half times that of the continent-of Europe. It con-
sists of China proper, and a number of smaller states, under the
control of the Emperor of China, or paying-tribute to him.

1. China Proper, which is the Warm-temperate portion
of Eastern Asia, consists of the extensive plains drained by the
Huang-ho and Yang"-tse-kiang; and the mountain lands south
and west of them. These plains, which are very fertile, are
more densely peopled than any other region on the globe.
Not only is all of the land occupied and cultivated, but multi-
tudes of people construct gardens and houses upon rafts on these
two great rivers, and the many canals which connect them,
and thus live on the water. It is thought that more than two
and 3. half millions of people live in this way.

Tine Pmlrwrlpal Occupation of the people is agriculture,
but it is carried on with only the simplest and rudest imple-
mag}; The most important products are nice and millet,-the

The Domestic Commerce is immense. A network of canals

even extending to the northern and southern extremes of the
country. These are constantly thronged with vessels. 136- ‘° 4‘
