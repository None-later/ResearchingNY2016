IV. The Indian 0cean.—This ocean differs from both
the others, in extending only as far northward as the tropic of
Cancer. It is, therefore, only about half the size of the Atlan—
tic. As it is small and surrounded on three sides by the con-
tinents of Africa, Asia and Australia, it may almost be called
a mediterranean ocean. No bands of islands line the shores,
and, therefore, no border seas are found in the Indian Ocean.
Two large gulfs, the Gulf of Bengal and the A rat7)2'(1n Seal,
between the southern peninsulas of Asia, are the principal

Europe, Asia, and Africa,

In Asia, the ye‘ZZ02.1: or Mon-

upper portion.

The home of our ﬁrst parents, from whom all mankind are
descended, is believed to have been in the western part of Asia
(Armenia), in the region in which the three continents are
joined together. Spreading from this central point, their de-
scendants, after ages had passed, ﬁlled the continents, forming
