]]l, Goren-nment.—The civilized nations ot the earth

have two very different forms of govern ment,——the 1i)¢f])2£l/l'2'C(l7l
overnment, or Democracy, in most of the countries in the
New World; and the jllonarcﬁy in those of the Old.

1. In a Democracy, the people govern t/cemselves, making
their own laws, and choosing their rulers according to a
constitution, or plan of government, which controls all. The
country so governed is called a Republic. The United States
is the most perfect example of a Republic.

2. In a lllonarc/zy, the people are governed by one sover-
eign ruler, who inherits his oﬂice, holds it during his lifetime,
and, at his death, leaves it to some member of his family,
usually the eldest son. Under an absolute, or entire, monarchy,
the people have no part whatever in making the laws. There
is no constitution to protect them from the oppression of the
sovereign, whose will is the only law; and who disposes as he
may choose of the life and the property of every one of his
people. All the Asiatic governments, and several of the
European, are absolute monarchies. '

Under a limited monarchy, the people have a part in
making the laws, especially such as relate directly to tl1e1n—
selves, or their property. They are protected from oppression
by a constitution, which gives them certain rights, and limits
the powers of the sovereign. All the most highly civilized
countries of Europe, except the Republic of Switzerland, are
limited or constitutional monarchies. The government of

Great Britain is considered as the best, and most free, of mon-
archics.

IV. ReligiolIs.—There are among the nations of the earth four distinct
systems of religon, the Christian, Jewish, jllohammedan, and Brahminic, all of which
have originated with the white race.

Europe, are all Christian.

Europe it passes north of the head of the Gulf of Bothnia, and
over the Wliite Sea; and, in Asia, over the head of the G. of
Obi, and near East Cape.

Africa is the hottest continent; Asia the coldest. Europe
is the warmest and most moist of the northern continents;
South America the coolest and most moist of the southern.

III. The most luxuriant vegetation is found in «the moist
portions of the torrid zone; that is, in’South America and
India. In the temperate zone, we ﬁnd the hardy forest—trees,
and all those plants most used by civilized man for food, and
as material for manufactures: as the grains, potatoes, fruits;
cotton, ﬂax, hemp. In the frigid zone we ﬁnd no vegetation,
except a few stunted shrubs and mosses.

IV. The largest and fiercest land animals, as the elephant,
lion, tiger, are found in the dryest continent of the torrid
zone; that is, in Africa. The largest sea and amphibious
animals, as the whale and walrus, are in the frigid zone.

Nearly all those animals most useful to man in performing
labor, or in furnishing him food and clothing, are natives of
the temperate zone. _

V. The most highly civilized nations are found in the tem-
perate zone. The frigid is not ﬁtted for civilized nations, be-
cause the climate is so cold that their most important occupa-
tions cannot be carried on. The torrid zone is also unsuited
to them, because the climate is so warm as to make people
weak and indolent.

In the temperate zone, we ﬁnd not only all those plants
and animals most needful to civilized man, but also a great
abundance of the most useful minerals. The climate, too, is
such that man can easily perform the labor necessary to obtain
and make use of them.

We thus learn the wisdom and
who not only made man,
