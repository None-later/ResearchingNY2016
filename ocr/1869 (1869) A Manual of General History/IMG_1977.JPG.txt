5011 Of 011511, and graiidson of Ham. It was situated on
the river Euphrates, and became the capital of Bab;/.l0’nia
or 0haldc'o,——a region lying along that river, and originally
called S/n'9zair.

hunter,” and is supposed to be the same as the Bdlus of
whom the historians speak in connection with the early
history of this country, or the Bel, afterward worshipped‘
as -a god by the people. The constellation Ori’on is thought .
to represent this celebrated hero. '

7. The line of Babylonian kings becomes exactly known
to us from the year 747 B. C. The “Canon of Ptolemy,”
an astronomical Work of the great geograplléf: gives 113*
from this date the succession of monarchs to 330 B. 0., when
Babylon became a part of the dominions of Alexander the
Great. The inscriptions discovered among the ruins con-
ﬁrm the truth of this Work.

8. The date of the commencement of the reign of Raha-
nas’sar is precisely fixed by the record of certain astronmm
ical phenomena, made by Ptolemy. This date, called the
Era of Nabonassar, is very famous in history. It is the
year 747 B. C. (more particularly, Wednesday, February ﬁﬁﬂl
of that year).
