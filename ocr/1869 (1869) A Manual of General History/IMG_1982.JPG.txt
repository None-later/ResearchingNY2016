t‘ Solomon (1015—9"i5 B. C.) was the most
the Jewish history. For him was re-

He formed alliances with the surrounding nations, opened
an active. trade with Egypt, and, to facilitate his~commer-
Cm Objects, erected Tad’m0r in the desert, which ai‘ier-
ward became so renowned as Palmyra. He also built 9.
superb navy, at a port (E'.zi7-on—ge'bcr) which he est.ablishe.d
at the northern part of the Red Sea. The history of his
Wisdom, his prospei'ity and wealth, and his fall into idol-
atry and sin, is greatly interesting and instructive. (1 Kings,
ii.—xi.)
54. After the death of Solomon, the kingdom was di-
vided, in consequence of the tyranny and insolence of his
son Re-ho-bo'am, against whom ten tribes revoltcd and fol-
lowed Jer-0-bo'am, who established himself at Shfichein, as.
king of Israel. To Rehoboam were thus left only two
tribes, forming the kingdom of Judah. A desultory War
was maintained between the two divisions during mesh
of the reign of J eroboam, which lasted twenty-two years.
