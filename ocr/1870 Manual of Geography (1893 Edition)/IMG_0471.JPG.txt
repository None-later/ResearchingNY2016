our views and ennobles our enjoyments." \Vhile, therefore, the author has

The Maps and the Map Studies are arranged to face each other.

The Map Studies are not more questions on the map, but are among the
most important pages of the book, on which the utmost care has been be-—
stowed. To give them greater brightness and value, much pleasing matter
has been thrown into them.

Pronunciation of difﬁcult names has been gene‘rall}‘- given where they are
first met with in the text ; but there has been added at the close of the book
a carefully compiled and judiciously selected Pronouncing Vocabulary.

Full Tables of Statistics have been appended to this work, but a large num-
ber of striking statistical data have been interwoven with the text.
