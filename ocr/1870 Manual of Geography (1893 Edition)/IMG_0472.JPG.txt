grains (wheat, corn, rye, oats, and barley), with hemp, ﬂax, and
many other useful plants. Among the trees are the beech and
the chestnut, the elm, oak, maple, and many fruit—trees.

5. Frigid Zones.—The vegetation of these zones consists
chieﬂy of lichens and mosses. None of the great agricultural

staples, except perhaps barley, will grow there.

6. Animals, like plants, have their geographical range. In
the Torrid Zmzz’ we ﬁnd the largest and most powerful land ani-
.mals, as the elephant, lion, and tiger; in the Zkiigzﬁrrate Z0724’, the
animals most useful to man, as the horse, the ox, and sheep; in
the Frzgzh’ Zone, the polar bear, the reindeer, and the walrus.

7. Geographical Range of Man.—Man, unlike other animals,
can live almost everywhere, in the Torrid and in the Frigid
Zones, in the depth of the mine and on the mountain top.

The city of Pasco, among the Peruvian Andes, is nearly three miles above
the sea.

Near N. lat. 55°wcﬁnd, in Siberia, the large and ﬂourishing cities of Omsk,
Tomsk, and Tobolsk; while in Russia, Moscow, in about the same latitude,
has 350,000 inhabitants. St. Petersburg itself, on the parallel of 60“ north
latitude, contains more than 500,000 inhabitants. Hammerfest, in Nor-

way, is within the Arctic Circle.
