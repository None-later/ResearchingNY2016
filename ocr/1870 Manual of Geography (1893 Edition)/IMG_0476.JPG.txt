Asia has been the cradle of all tiic prominent religion-: wt’ the

vsorld.

    

‘.5.

The last three are the prevailing forms of religion throughout Asia.

5. National Rank.——The native empires of Asia are the most
L populous in the world, but there is not one that has risen to im-

portance as a commercial or naval power.

China, with her magniﬁcent sea-front. and a population exceeding that of
all the nations of Europe eornbined, has never been able to command the

respect abroad that is accorded even to a second-class naval power of
Europe.

6. Political Geography.—Large portions of Asia belong to
Russia and Turkey. Not counting these, the countries of Asia
may be divided into three groups:

I. The four native independent nations.

These are China, japan, Persia, and Siam. Except japan they are absolute
monarchies. \Vith their dependencies they embrace about one-third of
the area of Asia, and nearly two-thirds of its inhabitants.

II. Countries belonging to foreign powers, as India, Burmah
and parts of Cochin-China.

III. Districts, such as Arabia and Afghanistan, which are oc-
cupied by tribes that have no responsible government.

7. Modes of Life and Civilization.——Thc Hindoos, Chinese,
and Japanese have attained a high degree of civilization.

Most of the scattered tribes, l’,owe\'er, lead a sort of half-civilized. half-
savagre l1Te—tending their ﬂocks, but robbing their neighbors, and plun-
dering the helpless.

Everywhere throughout Asia woman occupies a degraded position.
