1. AFGHANISTAN AND BELoocH1sTAN.—Afghanistan and l
Beloochistan occupy the zastarzz portion of the Plateau of Iran, l

and are for the most part desert.

Some of the mountain valleys are, however, well watered and

fertile. '

These valleys are inhabited by a settled population, but the country gen-
erally is peopled by warlike nomads, some of whom resemble in charac-
ter and habits the Highlanders of Switzerland and Scotland.

The chief caravan routes between India and VVestern Asia lie

through this region, which is separated from India by the Sulei-
man and Hala mountains.

The two great passes through these mountains, the Khyber Pass leading
to C a. b u l,
and the B0-
lan leading
into Belon-
chistan, may
be called the
north - west-
ern gates of
India.

2. PERSIA.-—Persia occupies the western part of the Plateau
of Iran.

It is a dry country, requiring for the most part artiﬁcial irriga-
tion; but wherever there is " the scent of water ” the little hills
-rejoice on every side, the valleys are clothed with waving corn
or fragrant roses, and the pastures are covered with ﬂocks and
herds.

Water is conveyed to the plains from the mountain springs
long underground aqneducts called break.
