ern Asia, and extends from the Black Sea to the Pacific Ocean.

it imiludﬁs Silmiria. Trans-Caticnsia. and Russian Turkestan.

5. Siberia.—Siberia is larger than all Europe, while its popu-
lation is only a little more than that of Scotland.

The climate in the /zorf/'2 is intensely cold, and in some parts
the mercury is frozen for two months in the year.

The rt/zlral region consists of a part of the great forest belt
which extends from the Baltic Sea to the Paciﬁc. It abounds
in fur-bearing animals, and hunting is an important occupation.

In the 50212‘/zcriz portion the climate is milder, and agriculture
is successfully carried on. The summer heat is often intense.

Here are found vast numbers of sheep, horses, cattle, and camels.
is raised in large quantities.

Grain

The Ural and Altai mountains are rich in emeralds and rubies,
gold, silver, platinum, copper, and iron.
The population consists largely of Russian exiles and their

descendants. The mines are worked chieﬂy by them.

The Steppes in the south are occupied by roving Kirghiz; the north by
tribes who, like our Eskimos, are in the lowest state of barbarism.

The exports are furs, the products of the mines, and fossil
ivory, which is found all over Northern Siberia.

Trade Route.—An extensive trade is carried on between Peking and St.
Petersburg through Siberia. It passes over the longest inland trade
route in the world. The supply of tea for Russia is transported on the
backs of camels from Peking to Maimatchin and Kiachta, and thence
through Irkutsk, Tomsk, and Tobolsk to St. Petersburg by boats on the
rivers in the summer, and in the winter by sledges drawn by dogs or rein-
deer. The transit occupies six months. (See Trade Chart, p. 124.)

North-east Passage.—In I878-9, Nordenskiold sailed from Sweden to Ja-
pan through the Arctic Ocean ; making what is known as the “North-
east Passage." (See map, p. 106.) It occupied fourteen months. This
passage, therefore, cannot supersede the route above described.

Irkutsk is the capital of Eastern Siberia; Tobolsk of Western.
Barnaul is a large mining town containing 120 furnaces. Tiumen is ex-
tensively engaged in the manufacture of Russia leather and woollen fab-

rics. Omsk and Tomsk are important towns.

6. Trans-Caucasia, formerly Georgia, lies on the south side
of the Caucasian Mountains. The valleys are fertile. The prin-
cipal products are the mulberry, the vine, and cotton.

The people are celebrated for their handsome features, and be-
long to the Tatar (la/z'tar) race. Tiﬂis is the capital and chief city.

Bakou is famous for its wells of petroleum, which is used as fuel by the
steamers on the Caspian.

7. Russian or Western Turkestan embraces the larger por-
tion of the territory lying between the Caspian Sea and the Al-
tai Mountains. The only fertile sections are the valleys.

Bokhara. is an immense thoroughfare for caravans trading between Persia
and China. It is noted also for the number of its mosques and schools.
