is the series of events that has brought the world up to its

present standard of enlightenment and knowledge?

These are questions that we have learned to ask only in
comparatively recent times. The asking of them and the
answering of them have given us history in its modern
sense; that is to say, history as a showing forth of the life of
nations, in place of history as the mere biography of kings,
or the record of battles and sieges, of dynasties and courts,

The theory of this book may be stated in a single sen-
tence: it is, to bring to the treatment of history for elemen-
tary instruction the same method that has proved fruitful
and interesting in the larger classic works. Such treat-
ment is in marked contrast with that of the compendiums
in ordinary use, which consist mainly of catalogues of facts
and of chronologic data. The author believes, however,
that the judgment of progressive teachers will fully coincide
with his own in this: that far more valuable and more
lasting results can be secured by giving scholars a vivid
general view of the institutions and civilization of the
greater nations than by cramming the memory with ever
so imposing an array of isolated facts and dates.

This book has grown out of a great deal of experiment-
ing with classes,—-testing of 70/tat pupils can take in and
assimilate, of what becomes fruitful in their minds, and of
what, on the other hand, is retained with difﬁculty or for—
gotten with ease. Care has been taken to cast the para- ’
graphs into such a form that the subject-matter of each
may be easily grasped by the pupil and the same readily
elicited by means of the marginal notes, — a device which
nwns to be better suited to a work of this grade 313”

call attention to the maps: they have been drawn with great
care by Mr. Jacob Wells, and will be found both accurate
and ample. The engmvixig-work, which is exceptionally
excellent, is by Mr. john Karst.

In addition to these features there are two salient points
to which notice is called: 1. This manual is made from
modern material, and presents the fruit of those researches
that have so essentially modiﬁed and so greatly enlarged
our views both of antiquity and of more recent times. 2.
It is written in the spirit of the modern m:z‘fzaa’,—-—that
method which deals with the broad, vital facts, rather than
with the pedantries of history.

As, by the courses of study in our public schools, general
history is not taken up until after several years’ work on
the history of our own country, it would have been quite
superﬂuous to insert here an imperfect compendium of
what has already been gone over in detail; hence in this
book the history of the United States is treated only in so
far as it touches that of other nations. ,

The author is deeply impressed with the conviction that
history, studied in the right manner, is of fundamental im-
portance in the growth of the mental a.nd‘mara.l name.
And he believes that such study is of especial mew: in
our own country, as a preparation for citizenship in in 
self-governing nation : for how can we appreciate what we
enjoy, unless we know how it mum’ in hi In the 
hope that this survey of the pmvidential ordzinﬂ-’o1ﬂ
human affairs may prove helpful, both to in 1 ’  ‘ 
and the formation of character, it is
