with but one grand division of the human fam_

tions, as also the states founded l)y European (0/0/zzkls, all
litnloiig to this <-.tlmologi<:al division. Thus we see that his-
tory ])rop<‘t‘ ttoneerns itself: with but one highly developed
type of inaiikiml ,; for though the great bulk of the popu-
lation of the glolie has, during the whole recorded period,
l)t:l()l1g(:(l, and does still belong, to other types of mankind,
yet, the (faiictasians form the only truly lzistorzkal race.
Hence we may say that civilization is the product of the

brain of this race.

The real his»
torit. race.

Of the peoples outside of the Caucasian race that have made some
ﬁgure in civilization, the Chinese, Mexicans, and Peruvians stand alone.
"tut though those races rose considerably above the savage state, their
civilizatiuii was strltionary, and they had no marked inﬂuence on the
general current of the world's progress.

6. Modern scholars divide this historical stock—-the
1;. mm 4,, Caucasian race———into three main branches:
‘’‘'‘°'"’‘ 1. 'l‘he A’ryan, or Indo-European branch;
II. The Semit’ic branch ; III. The Hamit’ic branch. This
classification is a lmguz'st1'c one,——that is to say, it is 3
division based on the nature of the languages spoken b)’
the three families of nations,———but at the same time it

”represents three distinct civilizations.

selycg belong: it lll<‘ll1(lt‘S Ilt';1l'l}':lll the pres~
cnt and past nations of l7,i,1rope,—~ the (lrecks,
Latins, Gerinans or 'l'cn"tons, (felts, and Sla\'o"iiians,-—-to-
gether with two ancient Asiatic. peoples, namely. the Hin-
doos and the l’ersians.

man, Slavonian, Greek, and Latin tongues all v1~,,e,,,,,,-,,y'
bear a 1’emarkal)le family likeness, and that h°‘” p"°"°d'
they share this likeness with the Sanscrit, which was the
ancient language of India, and with the Zend, the ancient
language of Persia. it is quite certain that the forefathers
of the l’ersians and of the llindoos and the forefathers of
all the European nations were once one people, and lived
together somewhere in Western ;\sia. This was at 21 time
long before the beginning of ]'L*(‘()r(lt'?(l history (for we know
nothing of the Greeks, Latins. (,}er1naiis, Celts, etc., as 51::/2,
until we ﬁnd them in /..':lll'(7/ll’) ; but still it is proved by the
evidence of language that their original home and native
seat was Asia.

9. The Semitic branch includes the ancient inhabitants
of Syria, Arabia, and the Tigris and liuphrates
countries. The leading historical representa-
tives of the Semitic branch are the Hebrews, Phcenicians,
Assyrians, and Arabs.

10. The Hamitic branch has but one prominent repre-
sentative,—the Egyptians. It is probable,
however, that the ancient Chaldze’ans also be-
longed to this race.

the Aryan, Semitic, and Hamitic races. It is c°.,,p.,;..,., 0;
