5, The real theater of Asiatic history, namely, South.

f  western Asia, may be subdivided into three m,,;,;°,, of
E regions: I. that west of the Euphra’tes; 2. the W-"""“ ‘MI-

  valleys of the Euphrates and Tigris; 3. the region be-
’ tween the Zagros Mountains and the In’dus basin inclusive.
_ 6, West of the Euphrates we have: I. The peninsula of
 ' f Asia Minor, the seat of several nationalities (of Fi V
which that of Lyd’ia was the most important) 9 m fawn’
and of various Grecian colonies ; their history is, however,
connected as much with Europe as with Asia. 2. Syr’ia,
bordering on the eastern shore of the Mediterranean Sea,
and comprising three distinct parts: (1) Syria proper; (2) «
Phoenicia, including the narrow strip of cdast between
Leb’anon and the sea; (3) Pal’estine, south of Phoenicia.
3. The peninsula of Arabia, stretching southeastward. This
last is of comparatively little importance in ancient history.
7. In the basins of the Tigris and the Euphrates were
several distinct territorial divisions: 1. Arme’-
nia, or the highland region between Asia Minor sﬂownﬁmi
and the Caspian Sea. 2. Assyria proper, which lay east
of the Tigris River and west of the Zagros 
3. Babylonia, comprising the great alluvial plain an
the lower course of the Tigris and of the Euphrates, 
stretching westward to the Syrian Desert. 4. Chailcwai,  S
country at the head of the Persian Gulf, stretching   M
ward from the lower waters of the Euphrates tn the! T
Desert. A, ‘5._ Mesopeta’mia,  ‘ '9
