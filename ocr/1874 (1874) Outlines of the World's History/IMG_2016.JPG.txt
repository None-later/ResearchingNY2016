least an approximate starting-point. 'l‘hus, it ‘em,’
is known that Abraham visited Egypt in.the zeth century

standing, and modern scholars are agreed that these struc-
tures were reared by kings of the fourth dynasty,--at a
time not later than the middle of the 25th century B. C. It
is evident from the monuments that the civilization of Egypt
at this early date was in many respects of an advanced
order and hence we must seek its origin still farther back.
But lzowi far back? According to the native historian
Manetho, twenty-six dynasties of kings ruled the country
from Me/nes the first king of the ﬁrst dynasty, down to the

the hieroglyphic characters were /at/er-signs, the characters I, 2, 3, 4, in ~ 
Ptolemaios should correspond respectively with 5, 7, 4, 2, in‘Kleopatra

(theﬁrrt letter in Ptolemaios being the ﬁft/z in Kleopatra, etc. ). In this

way several letters were discovered ; by means of other groups the whole -
alphabet was made out, and ﬁnally it was proved that by this phonetic: 7
alphabet the characters and groups could be resolved into the Coptiéil *
language of Egypt, which was already understood by scholars. It should

not be forgotten that the great work of deciphering was mainly effected
by the Fren savant, Champollion. it
