marked. In England LOCke’s [Essay on 1/1: phnouphy.
Human Urzr/erslanrling had at the time a great
repute; but the book has not held its place. Bishop

Berkeley propounded a form of idealism, and Reid on the
other hand put forth his system of Common Sense. The
contributions of Hume have probably had a more lasting
inﬂuence than those of any contemporary English phi-
losopher. French philosophy was almost wholly of a
negative and destructive character,——and hence had but

greatest name is that of Kant, whose system laid the basis
of all subsequent German metaphysics,
