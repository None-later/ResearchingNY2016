The study ofgeography is now, much more than at any.f0rm€1' PE“
riod, an essential element in education. It is second In importance
only to reading, writing, and rudimentary arithmetic. The new5Pal3*3l‘
is and must continue to be the chief source of that knowledge of cur-
rent events which is indispensable to every intelligent person. Its
telegrams and other items and articles necessarily assume that the
reader possesses a knowledge of certain geographical facts. It is the
aim of this work to present and impress these facts.

To this end the careful selection and arrangement of topics have
been regarded as matters of prime necessity in order to insure such a
unity of plan as to present a simple, yet practical, deﬁnite, and coher-
ent view of the subject.

The geography of commerce has been made the leading line of

thought, because commerce, domestic and foreign, is becoming more

and more a -dominant interest in the affairs of the leading nations of _.

the world, and because no other department of the general subject
presents in such bold relief their rivalries and mutual dependencies.
It involves a systematic presentation of the resources and industries
of countries as dependent upon climate, soil, mineral deposits, and
other physical conditions. It also includes all important information
concerning cities and towns as commercial, manufacturing,

and mining
centres, and an outline of the system of transportation,

domestic. and
international. The tables of reference show the total imports and
exports of all the maritime nations, and particularly the commerce of
each of these countries with the United States.

The work is essentially in two distinctparts-—-a ‘physical geography
and 3 P011993} geography. The physical geography is treated veg
