 

IN submitting this work to the public, we beg
leave to ask attention to a brief statement of its
leading features, confident that they will be found
to answer the requirements of the most intelligent
and experienced educators:

1. It is designed to be an introductory text—bool:,
as its name imports, to prepare young pupils who
are beginning the study of geography for the use
of a more comprehensive manual. With this aim
in view, both the kind of matter selected and the
style in which it is presented have been adapted to
the age and capacity of those for whom the work
is intended. Some topics——essential to a manual
for rm-aturer minds, but not suitable to be placed
before beginners—have been omitted ; and details
that would be dry and pointless to such youth

it have been expressed in suggelstive and enlivening
generalizations. These adaptations have been ef-
fected in conformity to a consistent ideal, so that,
while introductory to a larger manual, the work is
symmetrical and complete in itself.

2. An elementary geography should be as at-

tractive as it is useful; its subject-matter should
be presented with the continuity of an engaging -
narrative, calculated to stimulate curiosiity, as well
35 tfiiﬂfﬂrm the mind. This mode of treatment is
consistent with [the true pliilosophy of the su“};)jeg_t_
