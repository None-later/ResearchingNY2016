A

Fnon the title-page of this book may be gathered an idea
of its design, scope, and method. Prepared in accordance
with the views of advanced teachers, it is believed to embody
the most natural and philosophical system. It treats the
subject objectively,amakes knowledge precede definitions, and
presents facts in their logical connections, taking gradual
steps from the known to the unknown. It is offered to the
public in the hope that it will lay a substantial foundation
for the subjective development of this branch of study in the
HIGHER book. « '

In this volume the aim has been, not to teach much, but to
teach what beginners can understand and digest. It has been
sought to lay no unnecessary burden on the young learner;
to sift out the useful from the unimportant; and so to link
geographical facts with striking facts of history, of natural
history, and of social life, that they may be permanently,im-
pressed on the mind. Special attention is asked to the. system
of reviews, to the written exercises interspersed, to_the para-
graphs in heavy-faced type summing up from time to time
what is most necessary to be remembered, and to the ocea-
sional references introduced for the encouragement of more
extended reading oninteresting points.

The Introductory Course is designed to make subsequent
instruction intelligible, by giving the young pupil deﬁnite ideas
of position, direction, and distance; of the natural divisions
of land and water, and the manner of representing them on

maps; of climate; of the vegetable, the animal, and the iniu— :
_ oral kingdom ; and of the occupations and conditions of men. .
No formal deﬁnitions are given, but the new and necessary 

PREFACE.

ideas are imparted in reading-lessons, or are drawn out orally
by questions leading up from things ‘already familiar, mus,
trations are furnished on which to base such questions, and
model oral exercises are presented, which may be extended by
the teacher as time and circumstances allow. The pupil is
led out from the scenes of his every-day experience; and his
circle of knowledge is gradually widened till it embraces coun.
try after country, and ﬁnally includes the entire world. It is
believed’ that, ‘even with a partial preparatory course like that
here oﬁered, the pupil will be able to cope with the diﬁicul.
ties of the subject far more intelligently and successfully than
by commencing in the old-fashioned way with the earth as a,
whole and with abstract deﬁnitions.

The beginner is taught in this book to appreciate distance,
to apply the scale of the map, and to draw simple outlines by
the use of the scale and by imitation. The maps of a first
book in Geography should be distinct, unencumbered with
names, accurate, and attractive. Such We have tried to make
the maps in this volume; as regards the questions on them,
we" have sought to present a sufﬁcient number to familiar.
ize the pupil with their contents, Without overloading his
memory. ,

The authors trust that this little volume will be foun
eZemenz‘ar_z/, not merely in name and size, but also in the style
and quality of its matter, and above all in its development of
the subject; that the distinctive features of arrangement and
treatment may help to a more easily-acquired, thorough, -and

lasting acquaintance with the elements of Geography than“ ’

has heretofore been generally attained by Primary classes.
