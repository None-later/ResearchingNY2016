IN preparing this volume. thv aim has been to nomhine hemitny of typngm.
pity, omqﬂzlnaax of ’I:”?l3(7'(lH!*?i, attrm~ti\‘r- maps, and every vlelncnt of mech:'mi—
mil superiority, with :1 \-:Jri«~t_\* of original fmitnres. nml the improved nit-tlmrlcz
followed by the most .~mc<‘cssf1il te:,\c.li«-rs of the cl:rv. In furtliemnr-v, of this
objoot., no pains lmvu- lit-en spared tn st‘('\I|‘(' the :i,lilo,qt 11:.‘-4i_k;f_;u]t,q in (.\»,.nv,,1,‘.,
}\3.Hn\(,‘hl., and thv .-rirl of tl1«».-«- lw.-'~'t qtxulifiml to render service with their ~criti—
eisms and .~mggv.~tions.

This lliglwr (i(‘O_‘..{l‘!l])ll}‘ is not :1 repetition of the Elen1entar_V, either in its
matter or in its uimh» of «leveluping the sul)_jo('t.. In this book, the earth,
viz-wed from :1. stmnlpnint. \\'l'\l(‘ll the somewlmt muturer mind bps been t}IlﬂlJl(-ftl
to retrain, is ctmsidvre-«.l tir.~:t us a whole. It ms been :1 pritn:i.ry ()l)jL‘(3li from

and the (lCp(.‘l1tl(*l1(‘(*. of the facts of Political, on those of Pliysical, Gcogrnpliy;
for it is lu-licvml that these facts will be readily remembered, if the reasons
underlying them are properly comprehended. Geography thus taught. (“L’ilS(‘.'~‘
to be a. dry nsscmbl:’tge of isolated details, to be forgotten as soon as learned,
and is made to appear in its true light——as 21. science based on p1‘i11('iplc.~; which
explain its facts and connect them in :1 consistent whole.

Geriornlizzrtioli in the descriptive matter is another distinctive feature of
this work. By treating together sections that are alike in their general (-lnnu
uctcr, distuste_ful repetitions are avoided and space is S:1V(‘(l for much interest-
ing matter. An opportunity is thus gained for so linking gcogr:1.pliic.-Ll facts
with striking facts of history, natural history, ethnology, and social life, as to
impress thenr pemiancntly on the mind.

The prmniucnce given to :1 consideration of the leading Industries, as the
results of certain physical conditions, and especially to Commerce, will hardly
fail to be tL('(‘\‘.pt-{Ll)l8 in this practical age. The pupil is taught to what the
great cities owe their growth, the main routes of travel and traﬂic, where and
how our surplus products ﬁnd :1 market, whence we obtain the chief articles
of daily use, and the exports which the leading commercial cities contribute
to the world‘s supply. Peculiar industries of general interest are also explained
and illustrated with grtwhic designs; for examples, see the matter and engrav-
ings relating to silk, cotton, tea, coal, petroleum, and the industries of Europe
(p. 93), Asia (p. 101), and Africa (p. 110). This information is not only of
great: value in itself, but will impart fresh life to the study of Geography.

The introduction of occasiomil references to standard books is 21 new fea.~
ture, by which it is sought to form in both pupils and teachers a habit of
reading on interesting topics. T hose I‘g‘fP)'€i1(‘(’8 are not made to sz1.;npI3/ any—

In culling out the most important. matter for the text, an uns:1.tisfact.ory mea-
gerness has been avoided on the one hand, and cumbrousness of detail on the
other. Suggestive questions requiring independent thought lnive been intro-
duced from time to time. The pronunciation of diﬁicult proper names is given
where they first occur, as well as in Reference-Tables at the end. Various new
and useful matters are brought before the notice of the pupil ; such as the time
at different places when it is noon at Washington, the successive acquisitions

The (‘onin1¢:r('i:1l Map of the \Vorld and the llistorieal Maps will also be found ‘
of great value for reference. I
The illustrations are fresh. graphic, and lr1.~'truCiiVe works of art, on which
the pencils of VVaud, Gil)son, Beard. and other eminent designers, have been
employed. It nmy be mentioned as u proof of the value of these illustrations
and of the Pl1_\'SlCitl Maps, that some of their features were plagiarized even
before the Work was fairly in the hands of the public. ~ _
As to the use of the book a few suggestions may be in place. Let the »
deﬁnitions be perfectly mastered at the outset. Use the globe for purposes of
illustration wherever it is possible. VVhcn a town or any natural division is‘
mentioned at recitation, let the pupil describe its situation and point to it on"
a Wall~m-up or on the globe, that a habit of constantly referring to maps may
thus early be formed: to make such reference necessary, the situation of the
places mentioned is for the most part omitted from the text. Recitation by}
topics is recommended; but questions are supplied for those who desire them,t *
as well as for the convenience of the pupil in testing his own knowledge; »
Frequent reviews are desirable; for these, the questions just referred to an
the Statistical Tables afford facilities (pp. 64, '76, 94, etc.); or summaries ma ,
be prepared according to the models on page 9, and topics assigned to diﬁeraii j.
ent members of the class in turn. As a Written review, require a Table to  -
prepared by the student, with different columns, in which, after the names of,
the countries that have been studied, shall be set forth in succession theiéf 4,
boundaries, natural divisions, climate, soil, productions, exports, govemmenti,-A q.‘
capitals, chief cities, etc. _ '
The publishers trust that the two books which form this series 
found of material assistance to the teacher in imparting, and the WW1
acquiring, a thorough and lasting knowledge of Geography.
