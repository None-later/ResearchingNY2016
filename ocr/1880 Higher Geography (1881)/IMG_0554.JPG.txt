-Garlands belief in Brahma, “the soul of the universe,” and
 the “thrice eleven " gods of the Ve’da,s, or ancient books
‘Aﬁfhldia, regarded by the people as inspired. Among the
ﬁﬂftinguishing features of this religion are the doctrine of
the transmigration of the souls of men into the inferior
' annuals, and the division of the people into four distinct
autos (B1-ahmans, soldiers, farmers, and laborers), separated
from one another by impassable barriers.——(Consult Quack-
eubois “History of Ancient Literature,” p. 3.1,.) '

The doctrines of Brahmanism are rejected by a large
Sect of educated Hindoos, who have recently attempted to
free the national religion from superstition and idolatry.
This sect avowsits belief in one God and in the immor-
tality of the soul, respects the Bible, and regards Christ as
the wisest of prophets, but denies his divinity.

Buddhism, the religion of China, Thibet (tib’et), Indo-
ina, Japan, and Ceylon, derives its name from Buddha,
who, in the fifth century before Christ, introduced a simpler
fmtii to take the place of Brahmanism. Buddhism en joins
"h-3"‘? toward all men and the conquest of self,»
tines the most abject idolatry.
the Grand Lafma, believed by his followers to be the in—-

£90!!! temple he is worshiped by crowds of devotees.
