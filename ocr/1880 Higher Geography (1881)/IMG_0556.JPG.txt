S7/lif]".4CE.

Central and Northern Asia. »—(12?gfer to 15/16
01?,/,3;/1; ma/2.) (Icntral Asia, the highest part of the
Grand Division, consists of plateaus traversed by lofty
mountain-chains. The l.’LA'rr:A U or THIBET is the most
elevated region inhabited by man, being higher in
parts than the top of Mont Blanc.

This plateau is bounded on the south by the lof-
ticst mountain-range on the globe, the Himalayas,
having Mount Everest (29,002 feet) for their culminat-
ing peak. On the north, the Kuen-Lun (lcwcn-Zoon’)
chain separates it from the IIiouLANns or TURKES-
TAN, which are continued to the northeast in the MoN—
oomAN PLA'rIcAu.

Along the northern margin of the latter, extend
the Altai Mountains. Their northern slopes merge in
5 lower plateau, which in turn descends to the GREAT
SIBERIAN PLAIN; and this extends along the whole
of northern and northwestern Asia, terminating in the
lauthweat in the I’1.AxN or TURKESTAN.

On the east, the Plateau of Thibet descends to a
haves table-land, intersected by several mountain-
 which extend to the Cunu«:s1«: PLAIN.

RiVers.——Asia contains many large rivers, distin-
guished by great length, rather than by having exten-
sive basins or numerous tributaries. Rising mostly in

the central highlands, and following diiferent slopes,
they form four systems; these consist of,

I. The rivers that ﬂow into the Arctic Ocean and
its arms: these streams, while large, are frozen during
much of the year, and are comparatively unimportant
for commercial purposes. II. The rivers that flow
into arms of the Paciﬁc Ocean; these are of the great-
est importance as seats of internal commerce. III.
The rivers that ﬂow into arms of the Indian Ocean.
IV. The rivers that flow into inland bodies of water.

Lakes. The Caspian Sea and the Sea of Ar’al
seem once to have communicated with each other
and with the oceanic waters. N ow, cut oﬁ° from the
ocean, they are really salt lakes. Both contain stur-
geon and seals. Lake Balkash (ha/Ll-/ca/as/L’) is also

salt. Lake Baikal (bz"Ica/ll) is the largest fresh-water
lake.

The Caspian ﬁsheries are very proﬁtable; the salted
roe of the sturgeon is esteemed a delicacy in Russia, and
from the air-bladder of the same ﬁsh isinglass is prepared.

Climate.-—Asia, extending nearly to the equator
on the south and beyond the Arctic Circle on the
north, has every variety of climate. The Himalayas
and the ranges that join them on the east and west,
make a marked separation between the tropical coun-
tries on the one side and the temperate and cold regions

on the other. Extremes of heat and cold mark the
climate in the interior.

As regards the amount of rain

, great contrasts are

Vegetation.—1n the south the ve,9_jcfa.tion is
tropical, embracing rice, cotton, Sllgitl‘-(;}lll(_‘., (-otlcsii-,, in-

acteristic of the warm-tcm

peratc regions in the eastern
part. In higher latitudes,

the usual grains and fruits
of the temperate zones replace those of the tropics;

and still farther north vegetation becomes less luxuri-
ant, then sparse, and ﬁnally almost entirely t§llsa.pp

Minerals.—Tl1e metals, as well as the precious
stones, are widely distributed through Asia. The
slopes of the Ural Mountains yield large quantities of
gold, silver, platinum, and iron. The Altai Mountains
contain valuable deposits of the precious metals, cop-
per, and lead, though as yet they are but little developed.

- Coal and iron are found in China, India, and else-
where. Lead occurs in China, Siberia, and Turkey;
tin, in the Malay Peninsula.
