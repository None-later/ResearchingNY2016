ASIATIC RUSSIA.

HOW compose-.d.—To the Russian Empire belongs more
than one—third of Asia. This vast domain is made up of Siberia,
in the north; Russian Turkestan (toor-/ces-ta/an’), south of western
Siberia and extending from the Altai Mountains to the Caspian
Sea; and Transcauca’sia, between the Black Sea and the Caspian.

Siberia includes the icy wastes of the far north, where,
though there are no glaciers, the ground is perpetually frozen to a
great depth, the summer thaw affecting only the surface.

Along this ice—bound coast, the Swedish explorer, Nordenskjold
(nor'den—sho'ld), in 1878 -’79, succeeded in making the “Northeast Pas-
sage ” from the Atlantic Ocean to Behring Strait, though imprisoned in
ice for 294 days. It is thought that this northern route, as far as the
Le’na River, can be utilized for purposes of trade.

The only inhabitants of northern Siberia are native tribes of the
Mongolian race ; they wander from place to place, driving their herds
of reindeer before them in search of the scanty nourishment which the
Tundra affords. Some of these natives carry on an active barter with
Russian traders, receiving from the latter tobacco, knives, etc., and giv—
ing in exchange furs which they have themselves prepared, or which

they have obtained from the Esquimaux by voyages in skincovered
boats across Behring Strait.

Fossil ivory, consisting of the tusks of mammoths (large animals
now extinct), is procured in great quantities on the New Siberia Islands
and near the mouths of the rivers in the Tundra.—(Consult Simmondsls
“Animal Products,” 10. 5'44.)

For the areas, etc., of the countries of Asia, see Table on p. 103.

Siberia is valuable chieﬂy for its minerals and furs. A large
part of the population is composed of exiles from European Rus-
sia and their descendants; criminals and political offenders are sent
out every week from Moscow in convoys of two hundred or more.
Some of these are compelled to labor in the mines.

Siberia is the seat of an immense overland trade with China.
Teas, silks, satins, porcelain, etc., are obtained from the Chinese,
in exchange for furs, lamb-skins, metals, cottons, linens, and other
goods. Kiachta (Ice-a/z7c’ta/1) is the chief emporium of this trade.
The great caravan—route from Pekin, China, to Moscow, nearly
4,500 miles in length, passes through Inmrrsx (2'r—Icootsk’), the cap«
ital of Eastern Siberia, and ToBoLsK, the capital of Western Siberia.

Russian Turkestan embraces regions lately acquired ‘by
Russia in Central Asia. It includes extensive steppes occupied
by wandering tribes. These nom’ads (that is, wanderers) are of the
Turkish stock and the Mohammedan faith; they live ‘on the prod-
Ilotﬂ of their sheep, goats, and camels, and by plundering caravans.
' A TASHKEND’ is the capital of Russian Turkestan. Samarcand’
was once the metropolis of a great Tartar empire.

Parts of this region were formerly embraced in independent khan-
ates-——tha.t is, petty states governed by khans or chiefs. Bokhara (bo—

kﬁrmhy, though under Russian control, is still nominally independent,
and with large‘ , hilly tracts inhabited by barbarous Turcomans, const1—

In the strip of Arabia under Turkish rule are Mecca and M ' .
(me-de’n¢,1), which were respectively the birthplace and the burial- 13% 
of Mohammed, and are therefore held sacred by his followers Eli» .
year these cities are crowded with pilgrims from all parts of the Moham .0
medan world. Mocha is noted for exporting excellent coffee. 

Arabia consists principally of a parched and barren plateau, ‘
bordered by low mountain-ranges. Oases are found in the neigh- 
borhood of springs, and fertile valleys are formed on the interior *
slopes, where streams from the rain-collecting heights irrigate that
soil before they are absorbed by the sand. N edjed is an extensive
kingdom in the interior, noted for its ﬁne breed of horses.

The Ar-’abs that dwell in the open country are known as Bedbuins,

and are divided into tribes, each ruled by its own sheik, or chief. They A
raise millet and other grains, but their main employment is the care ‘ V’
of their horses and camels; caravans often suffer from their attacks. 1
Dates and tamarinds, frankincense and gum~arabic, are found in 
bia. Sponges, coral, ambergris, tortoise—shell, and especially pearls, are if
obtained by ﬁshermen on the coast. 
C The carrying-trade of the Arabs is large ; they gather tl16iie*I‘
products of Africa and Persia, in exchange for cotton-goods anti
other manufactures obtained from India. Muscat, said to be ‘£313
hottest place in the world, enjoys a large share of this traiﬁca bl’
reason of its excellent harbor and convenient position near the 811',
trance of the Persian Gulf; it is the capital of the Sultan of 
(0-ma/on’). A’den, the Gibraltar of the East, belongs to the B“l'**»
