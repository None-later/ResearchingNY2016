NOTE.

 
    
     
   
     

 THIS book forms an introduction to the author’s “Grammar School Geography," and
is two books furnish a complete course of geographical study for common schools.
The plan of this “Introductory” is similar to that which has met wide approval in

H

 author’s “Elementary, or Brief Course; that is, it combines reading-lessons (to
 rliven and stimulate) with recitation-lessons (to emphasize and fasten).
 its moderate size, simple style, and close relation of matter read to matter recited,

 aafis suited to the capacity of beginners, while the text is so graded that the "‘ Intro»

tory” connects with the “Grammar School Geography” without the need of any

 mediate manual.
