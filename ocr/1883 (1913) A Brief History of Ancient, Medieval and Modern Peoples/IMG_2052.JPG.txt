Aryan Dispersi0n.———How long our Aryan forefatllers
lived united in their early home, we have no means of know-
ing. As they increased in 11umbe1.'s, they would natural,ly
begin to separate. When they moved into distant regions,
the bond of union would become Weaker, their lltllguagg
would begin to var , and so the seeds of new to11g'11es and
new nations would be sewn. To the south-east these Aryan
e1nig'rants pushed into Persia and northern India; to the
West they gradually passed into Europe, whence, in a later
age, they settled Australia and America. In general, they
drove before them the previous occupants of the land. The
peninsulas of Greece and Italy were probably earliest occu-
pied. ’.l‘hree successive waves of emigration seem to have
afterward swept over central Europe. First came the Celts
(Kelts), then the ‘Teutons (Germans), and ﬁnally the Slaves.”
