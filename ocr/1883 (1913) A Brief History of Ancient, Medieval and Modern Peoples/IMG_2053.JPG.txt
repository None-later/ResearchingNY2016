1. THE POLITICAL HISTORY.

The Origin of the civilization which grew up on the
hzmks of the N llfé is 11ncerta.i11. The earliest accounts repre-
sent the country  divided into names, or provinces, and
having a regular government. About 27001 B. C. Manes
(me’-neoz), the ha.1f-mythical founder of the nation, is said
to lmve conquered Lower Egypt and built Memphis, which
he made his capital. Succeeding him, down to the conquest
of Egypt by the Persians under Camby’ses (527 B. 0.), there
were twenty-six dynasties of Pllaraohs, or kings. The his»
tory of this long period of over 2000 years is divided into
that of the Old, Middle, and New Empires.
