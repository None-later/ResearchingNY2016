Judah (975 to 586 :: 389 vea-rs) reta.ined the national
religion. Its twenty kings, save one usurper, were all of
tlie house of David in 1' lgular descent, But it-, lay in the
})ﬁ.tl1\E'1L)' of the mighty armies of Egypt and Assyria. Thrice
its elleinies held J L-rusuilein. At last Nebuoliadnezzam de-
slmoyed the city, and carried many of the principal inhabit-
ants to Babylon.

The Captivity lasted about seventy years. The Jews
pmspered in their adopted country, and inany, like Daniel,
rose to high fax-'01-.

(1),. 51), was friendly to the Jews,’ and allowed those who
chose to return to Judea and rebuild their temple. They
were g'!‘ea.tly cliziiigml by tl1ei1'bond:1.ge, and henceforth were
failihful to their religion.
