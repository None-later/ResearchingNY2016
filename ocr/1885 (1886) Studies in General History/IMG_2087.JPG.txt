Descr2'pt27rm of Tyre.

“Thy borders are in the midst of the seas, thy builders have
perfected thy beauty. They have made all thy ship hoards of
ﬁr trees: . . . they have taken cedars from Lebanon to make
masts for thee. Of . . . oaks . . . have they made thine
oars; the company of the Asshurites (Assyrians), have made
thy benches of ivory. . . . Fine linen with broidered work from
Egypt was that which thou spreadest forth to be thy sail; blue
and purple from the isles of Elishah was that which covered
thee. The inhabitants of Zidon and Arvad were thy mariners:
thy wise men, 0 Tyrus (Tyre), that were in thee, were thy
pilots. . . . Tarshish (Tartessus) was thy merchant by reason
of the multitude of all kinds of riches; with silver, iron, tin, and
lead they traded in thy fairs. . . . ' Syria was thy merchant by
reason of the multitude of the wares of thy making: they occu-
pied in thy fairs with emeralds, purple, and broidered work,
and ﬁne linen, and coral, and agate. Judah, and the land of
Israel, they were thy merchants: they traded in thy market
wheat, . . . and honey, and oil, and balm. . . . Arabia, and
all the princes of Kedar, they occupied with thee in lambs, and
rains, and goats.” — Ezekiel xxvii.
The prophet also names, among articles of merchandise, the
“ persons of men,” “ vessels of brass,” horses, horsemen, mules,
“precious horns of ivory and ebony,” wine, white wool, iron:

cassia, “precious clothes for chariots.”
