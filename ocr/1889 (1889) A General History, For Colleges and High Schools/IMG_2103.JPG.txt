PREFACE.

HIS volume is based upon my A rzdezzz‘ flzlvlory and M€dz'r2zval

and Mo([cr7z Hzklory. In some instances I have changed

the perspective and the proportions of the narrative; but in the

main, the book is constructed upon the same lines as those drawn

for the earlier works. In dealing with so wide a range of facts,
and tracing so many historic movements, I cannot hope that I
have always avoided falling into error. I have, however, taken
the greatest care to verify statements of fact, and to give the

latest results of discovery and criticism.
Considering the very general character of the present work, an

enumeration of the books that have contributed facts to my
narration, or have helped to mould my views on this or that
subject, would hardly be looked for; yet I wish Here to aelmnwl»
edge my special indebtedness, in the earlier parts of the history,
to the works of George Rawlinson, Sayce, Wilkinson, Brugsch,
Grote, Curtius, Mommsen, Merivale, and Leighton; and in the
later parts, and on special periods, to the writings of Hodgkin,
Emerton, Ranke, Freeman, Michaud, Bryce, S,-ymonds, Green.
(J. R.), Motley, Hallam, Thiers, Lecky, Baird, Mtiller.

Several of the colored maps, with which the book will be found
liberally provided, were engraved especially for my Ancient Eu-
