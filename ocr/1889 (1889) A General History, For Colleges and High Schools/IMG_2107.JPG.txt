THE RACES AND THEIR EARLY MIGRATIONS.

Divisions of History. ~—- History is usualiy divided into three
periods,—-Ancient, Meclizevzth and Modern. Aneient History
begins with the earliest nations of which we can gain any ecrtzun
knowledge, and extends to the fall of the Roman Empire in the
West, A.D. 476. Medieeval History embraces the period, zthout
one thousand years in length, lying between the fall of Rome and
the discovery of the New World by C0iUmbtlS,'A.I3. r492. Mod-
ern History commences with the close of the Medraevai period
and extends to the present time.‘
