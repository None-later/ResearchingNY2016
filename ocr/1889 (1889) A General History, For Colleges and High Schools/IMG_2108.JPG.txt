The polished stone implements found in the caves and river-

ravcls of Western liurope, the shell—mouiids, or kitclien-middens,
he Baltic, the Swiss l;ike—h:ibitatioiis, and the
ii all parts of Europe, are sup-

iipon the shores of t
. barrows, or grave-mouiids, found i
 posed to be relics of a prehistoric Turzinian people.

Although some of the Turaiiiiiii peoples, as for instance the
Chinese, have made considerable ailvaiice in civilization, still as
a rule the peoples of this race have made but little progress in the
arts or in general culture. Even their languages have remained
undeveloped. These seem immature, or stunted in their growth.
They have no declensions or conjugations, like those of the lan-
guages of the Caucasian peoples.

The White Race and its Three Families. -The White Race
embraces the historic nations. This type divides into three fami-
lies,-the Hamitic, the Semitic, and the Aryan, or Indo-European
(formerly called the japhetic).

The ancient Egyptians were the chief people of the Hamitic
branch. In the gray dawn of history we discover them already
settled in the Valley of the Nile, and there erecting great moiiu~
merits so faultless in construction as to render it certain that those

who planned them had had a very long previous training in the
art of building.

‘ The Hungarians and Turks are Turanian people: that have thrust them-
selves into Europe during historic times.
