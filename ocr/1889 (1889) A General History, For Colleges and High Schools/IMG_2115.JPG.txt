Basin of the Tigris and Euphrates. —The northern part of
the Tigris and Euphrates valley, the portion that comprised ancient
Assyria. consists of undulating plains, broken in places by con-
siderable mountain ridges. ‘

But all the southern portion of the basin, the part known as
Chaldrea, or Babylonia, having been formed by the gradual en-
croaeliment of the deposits of the Tigris and Euphrates upon the
waters of the Persian Gulf, is as level as the sea. During a large
part of the year, rains are infrequent _; hence agriculture is depend-
ent. mainly upon artiﬁcial irrigation. The distribution of the
waters of the Tigris and the Euphrates was’ secured, in ancient
times, by a stupendous system of canals and irrigants, ewliigzh, at the

present day, in a sand—choked and ruined condition, sflriead like a
perfect network over the face of the country (see cut, p. 4.1),.

The productions of Babylonia are very like those of the Nile
valley. The luxuriant growth of grain upon these alluvial flats

excitedﬂae wonder of all the Greek travellers who ‘visitedthe East. =

Herodotus will not tell the whole truth, for fear his veracity may
be doubted. The soil is as fertile now as in the time of the histo-
rian; but owing to the neglect of the ancient ‘canals, the greater
part of this once populous district has been converted "into alter-
nating areas of marsh and desert.

The Three Great Monarchies. ~—— Within the Tigris-Euphrates
basin, three great empires -I--the Chaldaan, the Assyrian, and the
Babylonian —- successively rose to prominence and dominion.
Each, in tum, not only lextended its .auth(;rit_y Over the valley, but

also made the power of its arms felt throughout the adjoining
regions. We shall now trace the rise and the vztriecl fortunes of
these empires, and the slow growth of the arts and st‘ien(:es from
rude beginnings among the early Chalclzeans to their fuller and '
richer development under the Assyrimi and Bztbylonizm monarcliies.

The Ghaldaeans a Mixed People. -— In the earliest times L0we1'
Cll{ll(l£‘€{l was known as Shumir, the Shinar of the Bible, while |
Upper Clialclrea bore the name of Accacl. The original inltabv ‘
rants of Chaltlsea were of ’l‘uranian race, and are called Accadians. l
