The Patriarchal Age. Tm» Hebrew history begins with the depart-
ure of Abmlizmi out of Ur of the (lhnhlecs, about moo R.(‘.. The
story of Abralmm and his ne-"phew Lot, of lsztmt and his sons jacob
and Esau, of the sojourn of the (les('.cn(l.1nts of _Ia.eob in Egypt, of
the Exodus, of the Conquest of Canaan nml the tippurtionment of
the land among the twelve tribes of Israel,-—-—-all this n1:1l'Vt.‘.ll01lS
story is told in the Hebrew Sctriptures with ‘.1. charm and sitnplieity
that have made it the familiar possession of Childhood.

The Judges (from about r300 to r095 n.t:.).-—A long period.
of anarchy and dissension followed the conquest and settlement of ‘r
Canaan by the Hebrews. “There was no king in Israel: every '
man did that which was right in his own eyes.” I)uring this time
there arose :1 line of national heroes, such as Gideon, _E¢i'.[)l1El’t&l'1,,
and Samson, whose deeds of valor and daring, anti the timely
deliverance they wrought for the tribes of Israel from their foes,
caused their names to be handed down with grateful remembnmec
to following ages.

’l‘l1e:»;e popular leaders were called judges because they usualiy
exerciserl judicial functions, acting as arbiters between the different
tribes, as well as between man and man. Their exploits are new
rated in the Book of Judges, which is a collection of the fragn1t€t1‘-
tary, yet always interesting, traditions of this early and basic 
of the nation's life. The last of the Imlgeswaé  ‘BREE 
embraces the close of the anarcliical age and the   '
monarchy. _ V A W i  W ’  _ . »
