lli:lL’1tll3'f7,7.;’!.T, in revenge for an uprising of the Jews, besieged
and captured Jerusalem, and carried away a large part of th
e

people, and their king Zedekiah, into captivity at Babylon (gee .
58). This event virtually ended the separate and political life   1

the Hebrew race (586 n.c.). Henceforth Judah constituted 
simply a province of the empires——Babylonian, Persian, Mace‘ '3:
donian, and Roman—wliich successively held sway over the
regions of Western Asia, with, however, just one ﬂicker of national
life under the Maccabees, during a part of the two centuries pre_
ceding the birth of Christ.

It only remains to mention those succeeding events which be-
long rather to the story of the Jews as a people than as a nation.  .3
Upon the capture of Babylon by the Persian king Cyrus (See P. 
60), that monarch, who was kindly disposed towards the Jews that if
be there found captives, permitted them to return to Jerusalem 
and restore the temple. Jerusalem thus became again the centre
of the old Hebrew worship, and, although shorn of national glory,
continued to be the sacred centre of the ancient faith till the

second generation after Christ. Then, in chastisement for re-
peated revolts, the city was laid in ruins by the Romans; while‘
vast numbers of the inhabitants——some authorities say over one
million-were slain, or perished by famine, and the remnant were
driven into exile to different lands. ‘ H ’
Thus, by a series of unparalleled calamities and persecut»i6ns,:
the descendants of Abraham were “sifted among all nations” T’
but to this day they cling with a strange devotion and‘loye2'1ty. I

Out of this old exclusive, formal Hebrew religion, transformed

and s irituali7ed by the Great Teacher, grew the Christian faith.
Out 02" the Old Testament arose the New, which We 550315 thmk

of as a part of Hebrew literature: for although written in the
Greek language, and long after the close of the political life of the
Jewish nation, still it is essentially Hebrew in thought and doc-
trine, and the supplement and crown of the Hebrew Scriptures.

Besides the Sacred Scriptures, called collectively, by way of
pre~eminence, the Bible (The Book), it remains to mention espe-»
cially the Apocrypha, embracing a number of books that were
composed after the decline of the prophetic spirit, and which ,
show traces, as indeed do several of the later books of the Bible,
of the inﬂuence of Persian and Greek thought. These books are
generally regarded by the jews and Protestants as uncanﬁnical,
but in the main are considered by the Roman Catholics as pos-
sessing equal authority with the other books of the Bible.

Neither should we fail to mention the Talmud, a collection  1
Hebrew customs and traditions, with the comments  T ‘
the rabbis, a work held by most Jews next in   ;
