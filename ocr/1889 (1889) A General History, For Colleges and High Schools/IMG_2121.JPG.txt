Tyre and Sidon. —— The various Phoenician cities never coalesced
to form a true nation. They simply constituted a sort of league,
or confederacy, the petty states of which generally acknowledged
the leadership of ’l‘yre or of Sidon, the two chief cities. The
place of supremacy in the confederation was at ﬁrst held by Sidon,
but later by 'l‘yre.

I From the nth to the 4th century B.(,‘., Tyre controlled, almost
without dispute on the part of Sidon, the affairs of Phoenicia.

Phoenician Commerce.—When we catch our ﬁrst glimpse of
the Mediterranean, about 1500 iz.c., it is dottéd Will! the Sails Of
l’ho3nici.'1n navigators. It was natural that the people of the Phoe-
nician coast should have been led to a seafaring life. The lofty
mountains that back the little strip of shore seemed to shut them
out from a career of conquest and to prohibit an extension of their
land domains. At the same time, the Mediterranean in front in-
vited them to maritime enterprise; while the forests of Lebanon
in the rear offered timber in abundance for their ships. The
Phoenicians, indeed, were the ﬁrst navigators who pushed out
boldly from the shore and made real sea voyages.

The longest voyages were made to procure tin, which was in
great demand for the manufacture of articles in bronze. The
nearest region where this metal was found was the Caucasus, on
the eastern shore of the Euxine. The Phoenician sailors boldly
threaded the Arlrrean Archipelago, passed through the Hellespont,
braved the unknown terrors of the Black Sea, and from the land
of Colchis brought back to the manufacturers of Asia the coveted
article.

Towards the close of the 1 1th century B.C., the jealousy of the
Pelasgic states of Greece and of the Archipelago, that were now
growing into maritime power, closed the Algean Sea against the
Phoenician navigators. They then pushed out into the Western
Mediterranean, and opened the tin-mines of the Iberian (Spanish)
peninsula. When these began to fail, these bold sailors passed the
Pillars of Hercules, faced the dangers of the Atlantic, and brought

lgack from those distant seas the tin gathered in the mines of
main.
