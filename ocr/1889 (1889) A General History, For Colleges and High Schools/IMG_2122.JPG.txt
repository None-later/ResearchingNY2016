trihution of the arts and the spread of culture among the early
peoples of the Mediterraneart area. “Egypt and As_syria_,” says
Lenonnant, " were the birthplace of material civilization; the
Canaanites [Phtenicians] were its missionaries.” Most prominent
of the arts which they introduced among all the nations with whom
they traded was that of alphabetical writing.

Great Enterprises aided by the Phoenicians.—-While scatter-

ing the germs of civilization and culture broadcast over the entire
Mediterranean area, the enterprising Phtenicians were also lending
aid to almost every great undertaking of antiquity.

King Hiram of Tyre furnished Solomon with artisans and skilled
workmen, and with great rafts of timber from Lebanon, for build-
ing the splendid temple at Jerusalem. The Phoenicians also pro-
vided timber from their ﬁne forests for the construction of the great
palaces and temples of the Assyrians, the Babylonians, and the
Egyptians. They built for the Persian king Xerxes the Heilesponw
tine bridges over which he marched his immense army into Greece
(see p. 81). They furnished contingents of ships to the kings of
Nineveh and Babylon for naval operations both upon the Mediter-
ranean and the Persian and Arabian gulfs. Their ﬂeets served as
transports and convoys to the expeditions of the Persian monarchs
aiming at conquest in Asia Minor or in Europe. They formed, too,
the naval branch of the armaments of the Pharaohs ; for the Egyp-
tians hated the sea, and never had a native fleet. And it was
Phoenician sailors that, under the orders of Pharaoh‘-Necho, ciao
cumnavigated Africa (see p. 26) —— an undertaking which, although
attended perhaps with less advantage to the world, still is reckoned
quite as remarkable, considering the remote age in which it was
accomplished, as the circumnavigation of the globe by the Farm-
guese navigator Magellan, more than two thousand years later.
