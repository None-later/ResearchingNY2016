MOSQUE AND CAABA AT MECCA. (From aphotograph.)

Mohammed possessed a deeply reli;_.;ioiis nature, and it was his
wont often to retire to ii, cave :1 few miles from Mecca, and there
spend long vigils in pra_ver. He declared that here he had visions.
in which the angel ("xahriel appeared to him, and made to him
revelations which he was commanded to make known to his
fellow-men. The sum of the new faith which he was to teach was
this: “There is but one God, and Moliainined is his Prophet.”

Mohammed communicated the nature of his visions to his wife,
anclslie became his ﬁrst convert. At the end of three years his
disciples numbered forty persons.
