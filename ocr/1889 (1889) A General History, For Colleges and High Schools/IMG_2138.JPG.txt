ports of Europe and the towns of the Syrian coast. Moreover,
various arts, manufactures, and inventions before unknown tn

scarcely less noted Englishman, Sir John Mandevillc, to 

the most remote countries of Asia. Even that spirit of   

enterprise and adventure which rendered illustrious the ﬁfteenth

century, inspiring the voyages of Columbus, Vasco dc Gama, aﬂ  
Magellan, may be traced back to that lively interest in   

eal matters awakened by the expeditions of the crusaders.
