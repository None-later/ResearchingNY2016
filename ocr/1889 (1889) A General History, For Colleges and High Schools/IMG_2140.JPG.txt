llnring the last fifty years the distinctive features of society have
wholly cli:1n;;<:<l. The battles now being waged in the religious
and the political world are only faint er-hoes of the great lonttles of
the sixteenth, seventeenth, and eighteenth cenmrieu‘. A new
movement of human society lms licgun. (fivilization has entered
upon what may be called the lndn.<tri;1.l Age. or the 1\g:: of Mn-
terial ].’rog1'ess.

The decade between 1830 and 1840 was. in the phrase of
Herzog, “the cradle of the_ new epoch.” In that decade several V
of the greatest inventions that have marked human progress were
ﬁrst brought to practical perfection. Prominent atnong these-
were ocean steam navigation, railroads, and teileg.raph<4.' in the
‘  year 1830 Stephenson exhibited the first really suoctessful lawma-

 tive. In 1836 Morse perfected the telegraph. In (838 ocean:
steanisliip navigation was first practicall_\' solved.
The rapidity with which these inventions have been introclucedv
into almost all parts of the world, partakes of the mawelflmts.
During the last ﬁfty years the continents have been coated wish
:1 perfect network of railroads, construtted at an erwrmnous cost

of labor and capital. The aggregate  of tin! %!l£!'3 mm L. j‘
