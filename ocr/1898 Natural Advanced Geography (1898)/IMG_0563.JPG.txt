TEE Natural Advanced Geography forms, with the Elementary book of this series, a complete and rational
school course in the study of geography as recommended by the Committee of Fifteen.

In its newer aspects school geography demands much that is not to be found in the older text-books, as

T a. glance through this volume will indicate. One of its prime requirements is the arrangement of the apparently
isolated and unrelated facts of geography into such order that their correlation may be perceived and the
unity of nature recognized. Wlien the subject is thus studied in orderly sequence, it unfolds itself naturally
and logically, each lesson preparing the way for those which follow, and for this reason the new geography
is found to be not only more interesting and useful than the old, but vastly more intelligible, and hence much
easier for both the pupil and the teacher. ;

Throughout the Natural series the central thought is Man in his relations to his physical environment, but
the plan of treatment is essentially different in the two books. In the Elementary the young pupil is led to
observe the peculiarities of man and nature about his own home, and with these standards of comparison he is
gradually led to a conception of the world as a whole. This Advanced Geography, however, treats first of the
earth as a Whole, and of the general manner in which its physical features, its plants, its animals, and its
human inhabitants have reached their present condition and distribution through centuries of change and
development. This part of the subject has been presented with considerable detail, because‘ of its funda- ,
mental importance. No country or people has attained its present condition unaﬁected by the inﬂuences of
other, and often of very remote _regions. The remainder of the book is devoted to the various parts or
countries of the earth. The development of each part is studied and analyzed in the light of the preceding
lessons on the Earth as a Whole, and thus true relationships are established.

The Topics for Oral and Written Work and the exercises in Correlations and Comparisons which have

been inserted at convenient intervals in this book not only serve as reviews, but are so framed that they stimu-
late thought and lead the pupil to view what he has learned from a somewhat dilferent standpoint. They form
a nucleus for the “laboratory work ” now recognized as an essential feature in the study of geography.
T The optional Supplemental Work at the ends of the various sections is not essential to the course, but
 abounds in suggestions for appropriate collateral reading and for variations in the exercises of the class or
of individual pupils. This work the teacher may use to the extent which time and circumstances permit.
