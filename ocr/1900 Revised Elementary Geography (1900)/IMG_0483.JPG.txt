P’UBLISHER’S PREFACE.

Marrrusw F. Mwnv won fame not merely as a geogra-
pher, but as a scientist. It was in recognition of his Work
in making geography a science, that ‘every nation of
Europe honored him with degrees, decorations, and medals,
and that Humboldt, the great naturalist, asked Prussia to
add to these a duplicate of the Cosmos Medal of Science,
which had been given to Humboldt himself.

In his series of geographies, Maury refused to follow the
plan 01 all the accepted text-books of that day. His plan
was to present, in simple Words and in the form of a
story, interesting facts about the diiierent people of the
earth, their homes, their industries, and the lands Where
they live ; and at the same time to call attention to those
physical laws which largely determine the condition, the
character, and the industries of a people. As he himself
expresses it: “While the author has reproduced in the
pupil’s mind the same vivid pictures of the various parts,
places and objects of the globe, which as an eye-witness he
himself retains, he has constantly aimed at pointing out
geographical laws, and at giving learners glimpses into the
terrestrial machinery.”

When published, these geographies were such a radical
departure from the old methods, that many teachers were

not prepared to accept them ; but leading educators have
gradually come to Ma-ury’s position, and to-day the prin-
ciples that he advocated are endorsed by the Committee
of Fifteen of the National Educational Association.

The special features to which attention is called are :

1st. The Home, the Centre of Thought:-—-Tlie study of
the world is begun at the home of the pupil, and other
countries and places are presented in their relation
to it.

2d. The Earth as a Umli.-—In the ﬁrst thirty pages the
earth is presented as a unit, and in the pages that follow,
this conception of it is at all times kept before the pupil.

The continents are then taken up more fully, and after

  
 

the pupil is familiar with the details of each continent,
a review is given which leads him to look at the continent’;
as a whole and in its relation to the earth as a unit. T

3d. Relief Maps.-—Political maps teach the names of
political divisions, of mountains, rivers, etc., all of which
are purely arbitrary. After these names are learned, relief
maps follow. These picture to the eye the physical
features of the continents. By locating upon the relief
map those features With which he is already familiar, the  A. 
pupil can see the physical reasons for many of the facts .. T’
that he has learned. If preparatory oral lessons are given,  
the relief map should then be used ﬁrst. _

4th. The Earth as the Home of Jlfam.-—-The idea of the ; .
earth as the home of man is the chief thought of the book. : f 
The full-page colored illustrations serve to accentuate this  ,  i
thought by giving vivid pictures of the people of each 
continent and of the homes in which they live. i t

5th. The Lessons.——Each lesson presents interesting 
facts in the form of a story to be read by the pupil. Tho.  
teacher may talk with her class about each lesson, and may  V
ask her own questions to develop thought and ﬁx impor-
tant facts in the child’s mind. For pupils too ‘young to»
formulate answers for themselves, -a. part “For Recita
tion” is added in which answers are formulated.

6th. I llu.stratz'ons.—The illustrations are all from pho-
tographs and are accurate. Each picture teaches some
deﬁnite idea, and the descriptive text under many of them
makes the pictures an integral part of the lessons.

The colored relief maps are used by permission of Mr.
C. L. Patton, Who designed them and who also Seleﬁﬁea
the new illustrations and planned the course of instmﬂﬁail
which they embody. We take pleasure also in acknowlcdg“
ing the valuable suggestions received from several iﬁsﬁn‘
guished educators, and in thanking all-F’00F1'e3t?0"de’fts in
all the leading countries of the world who ]I§_r3V° cﬁumlshﬂd
