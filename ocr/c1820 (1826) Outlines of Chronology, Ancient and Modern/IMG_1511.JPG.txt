This work in introductory to a series of Histories, now preparing on an
improved plan, calculated to render the study easy, interesting, and per-
nianentl useful. The following will appear soon-—viz.

B air’s Outlines of Ancient History.
Blair's Outline: of Modern History.

Blair's Outlines of the History of Greece.
B|air‘s Outlines of the History of Rome.
Blair’: Outlines of the History of England.
Blair‘: Outlines of Ecclesiastical History.

Mr These works are entirely original, but a~re_called Blair's, (hein
partly on the ‘plan of his celebrated ‘hooks for education,) for the purpose 0
giving an uni oriri and connected series, a title designating such connexion.

IT is . . .
()bs‘e1‘V8.tl0|1 of most persons, that few individuals, of

[hose even who have made History a_careful study,
ever obtain a clear and distinct general view of the sub-
ject. Many, indeed, understand well a few sepafatﬁ
points, but with most, if its whole details are not
speedily rejected from the memory as a load ‘too hur-
dcnsonie to be supported, they lie in the mind in a
state of obscurity and confusion. In such cases the
recollection of events is ditiicult and uncertain; the
separation of even leading events, from the tangled
mass, can scarcely be effected; and the formation of
analogous facts into classes, for the purposes of reason-

ing and inference, is a thing not thought of.
The reason of this is, doubtless, that the ﬁeld of Gene-

ral History is too large-—its details too multifarious;
they are presented also in a shape too mazy and com-
plex to be distinctly comprehended even ;——much less
to be treasured in the memory. In order to be effect-
ually understood and preserved, they must be arranged
into classes, _or grouped into periods under some general
characteristics, which maytie them togetherb asso-
ciaItion, and preserve them for the call of meal ection.
n the present work an attempt has been made to
iutcizh a classiﬁcation as is needed. The subject
