It consisted of three stories, and was divided into
many small apartments, for its intended inhabitants.
At the appointed time the family of’ Noah, and all
kinds of beasts, birds and reptiles, by pairs, entered
the ark, and God caused the earth to be so overﬂowed,
by rain from the skies, and by breaking up the foun-
tains of the deep, that every creature without the ark
perished.

After floating on the water 150 days, the ark rested
on one of the summits of Mount Ar’arat, though it was
several months afterwards that the waters entirely
departed from the earth. ’

According to the computation of time used in Scrip-

tiii'e,‘Noah and his companions continued in the ark

one year and ten days.

Trarlitioiis respecting a general deluge have been
handed down among almost all nations, and the earth
bears visible marks of having experienced some great
convulsion.

separate for some time, but were at length unit-

Tlio mime of Assyria is derived from Ash’ui', the se-
