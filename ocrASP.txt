Given to all Candidates
for Entrance in

The phenomenal growth of
State College has received no
check this year. On the con—
trary. it seems as it it has
gained added impetus. This
yeal's entering ela‘s has out-
str vped any of former years in
respect to numbers. Up to
Monday morningr 330 applica-
tions for entrance had been re-
ceived. an: it i 1 safe true
that by the time the college has
been opened and classes are
well under way this number
will have been far snr .sed.
t'\ ren1al‘kahle feature. and one
that comes as .1 good omen. is
the presence of over {)0 men
among the randidtnes for
entrance The proportion of the
men in the college has been
growing steadily with every
new class. lirom about In to I
in the Hi s‘ favor only a very
few yttlrs ago. it has now
reached the 5 lo 1 mark. There
are now in State College stuv

increasing as well as the num-
ber of the states represented
here. At present there are
people enrolled .lrom Mas,

deuce of the good reputation
