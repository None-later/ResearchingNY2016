stitution can best serve the
coming generation by turning
out better students to meet the
many great and serious prob-
lems this nation will have to
face. We used to believe our
nationalism was turning into
internationalism, but now the
war has poralized nationality
and this is bound to have its
effect in the high schools. In
continuing he called attention
to the fact that Europe to—day
is making tremendous sacri—
fices that influence the inmost
life of the people, whereas we
Americans are living in case
and comfort. There is a great
dang. in a Europe prepared
and hardened as compared
with an America not ready or
lit. Things will be decided by
experiences. We have none,
therefore we must learn to
voluntarily make great sacri-
fices since they are not forced
upon us. More Dr. .|5rubacher
referred to the late Dean Blue
as one who had made sacrifices
and was prepared. .ln him the
college had an ideal teacher
who lived for the service he
could give and who left noth—
ing undone, as long as he could
thereby increase his value to
the students. In closing. the
President said that Dean Blue
possessed the professional vir—
tues, professional honor and
professional sincerity, and he
urged the students to make
these virtues their own and to
emulate Dean Blue by map-
ping out and followng an ideal
of service.

A Few of the Many Appointments
of Former State College
Students.

nus. was appointed to a similar
position in the city of llridge-

port, Conn.

Speaking of l‘lridgeport
makes us wonder how many
know that a State College man
is filling the position of Super~
intendent of schools in that
busy New England city.
Samuel J. Slawson is the man.
He graduated from the State
Normal College in 1894 and
has held since his graduation
many important teaching posi-
tions. He was at one time
Superintendent of schools in
Rensselaer and, before going
to Bridgeport. superintemled
the schools of Clean, N. Y.

Sarah Tarshis ’16, whom
many students will remember

 

as “Dot” in last year's Dick-
ens play, “ The Cricket on the
Hearth,” is teaching Home
Economics in Solvay, N. Y.

the largest that ever heard l'rof.
lx‘isley lecture on the history of.
linrope. Over 280 are now
registered and it is safe to say
that the total number will reach
close to 300. Ilut not only the
required courses have a large
attendance, but the elective
courses are also well patronized,
which points to an ever growing.
interest in history. During the
opening days of the college
