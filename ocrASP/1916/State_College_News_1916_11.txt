PRESIDENT BRUBACHER
TALKS 'I‘O FRESH»
MEN.

Transition From High School to
College Life Abrupt.

 

On Friday morning, Oct. 6,
the Freshmen were given a
special welcome by Dr. Jim-
hacher. The large class of 1920
was characteristically a Fresh-
man class in that it crowded
itself into one corner of the
auditorium as far away from the
platform as possible.

'Dr. Brubacher called the
attention of the class to the
danger that lies in the misuse of
the freedom they have so sud-
denly gained. Up to now the
members of the class have been
under the fostering care of some
kind teacher both in and out of
the schoolroom. in college that
must necessarily be different. it
will be impossible to know much
about the outside life of the stu—
dent. Great harm might come
from this abrupt transition from
the close supervision in the high
school to the freedom of place
in the college. The President
urged the Freshmen to use their
free hours for self—education;
only in that way, he said, can
scholarship be attained. He
further advised them to spend
their free time in the best place,
and as one of the very best he
named the State Library, an in-
stitution the opportunities of
which are hardly equalled any-
where in the college, and he
urged the students to use that
library with scholarly intent and
purpose.

After his speech of welcome,
Dr. Brubacher called the stu-
dents’ attention to the fact that
the churches of all denomina-
tions in the city desired to have
the students join them during
their stay in Albany. In order
to enable the churches to get
into touch with the various in-
terested members of the class,
those who cared to do so were
asked to give their name,
address and the church of their
choice. Many responded to the
rcquest. The *hurches of
Albany feel that this is an
important period in the life of
the young man or woman and
that the connection with tl‘l(
church should not be broken
now.

LETTERS TO

We herewith publish a letter
sent to us for that purpose. In
doing so we wish to state that
the column of the “ News ” is
open to all under one condition,
that all letters he signed. This
does not mean that the name
will be publishc .

Editor of State College News:

N. Y. S.  T. is no longer a
normal school, she is a college.
Don't for get this! The student
athletic activities show that our
college has taken her place with
the other colleges. Our basket—
ball schedule speaks for that.
llut there are many things that
must be changed wit/tin the col-
lege. And one oi the greatest
of these is the matter of cla.s
rivalry and class rushes.

Everyone will admit that in
past years, particularly in the
year of 1915—16, the rushes have
not amounted to much. This
could easily be l‘Cl'llCdlCd.

Upper classmcn should have
charge of such matters as in
other colleges. Why would it
not be a good idea for the Presi-
dent of the Senior class to

 

THE EDITOR

appoint three Seniors and twa
juniors, or possibly more, to
attend to this? These men could
get together early and plan for a
couple of “ rushes ” or “ scraps ”
to be held " soon.” The “scraps”
could take place in a few days
and the supremacy of one or
the other class could be estab-
lishcd.

Then the committee could
also decide as to the extent of
class rivalry during the period
from the opening of college to
Moving—Up Day.

Now, class rivalry may be
harmful if not carried out in the
right manner. But if it is
carried out in the right manner
it would put life in the college.
It would awaken spirit, which
seems to be taking a snooze. It
would advertise the college and
would be a greater beneﬁt than
we realize.

Freshmen and Sophomores,
consider this matter, Mr. Senior
l‘resident, since you hold the
highest undergraduate position,
you look carefully into it.
