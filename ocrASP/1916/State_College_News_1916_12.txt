IMPROVEMENTS IN
AUDITORIUM.

/\ bit of news that will be
welcomed. especially by the
would-be Southerus and Mar-
lows of the college, is about an
inmrcwcment that has been
made in the auditoritun. The
platform which last year was
temporarily enlarged by the
members of the Dramaties
class, under the supervision of
'l'rofessor Kirtland. has now
been permanently brought up
to its new size. The two iron,
somewhat: ungainly lonking.
rods that were used to hold the
wire supporting the curtain
and which were situated on
earh side of the platform. have
been displaced by two artistic
appearing posts that are in
mnrh better keepng with the
atmosphere of their surround—
ings than were their predeces-
sors of iron.

BOOKS 1va LIBRARY uow
CLASSIFIED.

State Library Method Is Carried
Out.

All students who have been
much delighted on many oc~
-asions with the facilities pro-
vided for them at the New
York State Library, and who
were especially aided by the
very convenient method of
classiﬁcation which is in use
there, will no longer have to
look upon the Education
'l‘3uilding as the only place ex-
tending those facilities. Right
in our own library in the col-
legc building you will ﬁnd now
the State Library system dupli-
cated. Miss Cobb, who gained
valuable experience as a Incin—
hcr of the staff of the State Li-
brary, has completed here the
classiﬁcation of the books he—
uun last year under the direc-
tion of Professor Kirtland. so
that any book wanted can he
found with case and speed.
l’icsides Miss Cobb will 'have re—
served in special places, which
will be designated as such, all
books needed for special refer:
encc work. Our library will
always be in close connection
with the State Library. which
means of course the enjoyment
of many specia.’ advantages by
the students.

The library will be open from
S A. M. to 5:30 P. M. and may
be opened evenings if the de—
mand proves great enough.
Mary Blue ’19 and E. Punder-
paugh ’19 are assisting,r Miss
Cobb.
