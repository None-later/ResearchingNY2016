ATHLETICS.

There happened to come to
our ears the other day a remark
that some kind- friend made
about our ﬁrst issue. It was his
only criticism and was to the
etiect‘that the “News” must
contain something on athletics.
Rost assured, James, athletic
notes there shall be. As it was,
'our ﬁrst issue was crowded, and
then, good things come slow,
you know. But, coming back to
athletics, we wish to remind
everyone of the fact that so far
there have been no contests or
activities of” any kind. How-
ever, now that the cenfusion
going along with the opening oi
'college has subsided, interest in
athletics is coming into.its own.

FOOTBALL.

Sept. 30, S. C. vs. Stevens at
lloboken.

Oct. 7, S. C. vs. llobart at
Geneva.

(let. 2!,  C. vs. h‘liddlehury
at h'liddlebin'y.

()et. 28, S. C. vs.
’l'ech. at Potsdam.

We could not restrain our-
.selves from putting the above
schedule into print. it is the
schedule State (Tollegc was to
have followed, but which was
sadly left in the lurch. h'lanagcr
llohaus deserves credit for one
thing, he is a good diplomat. for
none but a diplomat could have
secured games from the above-
namcd colleges without'having
a team to back him. Also
h’lanager l‘lohaus has foresight,
for he was wise enough to pro-
vide {or a possible abrogation
of all contracts, which came him
in good stead when such action
became a necessity. So 011'
dream of football in State Col-

Clarkson

lcge has again gone up in
smoke. It is very doubtful if
the postponement of college

opening was alone to blame for
the failure. This paper may
some day be a daily. but it will
have to grow gradually. Just so
football will have to ﬁrst creep,
then stand, then walk, and some
(lay it may run. We would sug-
gest a Freshman team this fall.
augmented from the ranks of
the other football enthusiasts in
the college. There could be
scrub games now and contests
with secondary schools. Next
year we could have our ﬁrst
inter-class games and in lQIQ
our longed for 'Varsity. What
a chance for some 1920 man. if
you feel you have it in you,
start the team and accomplish
for your college one of the
biggest things ever undertaken
here"

 

LAWN TENNIS.

Every tennis player in college
is urged to take a part in the
tournament. It is bound to be
an interesting ﬁght. We should
say that on the face of things
Gowey ’18, last year’s champ,
will repeat this year, but sur-
prises are always in order. By
the way, we have excellent
material for a tennis team.
With proper care in the selec-
tion of a team we ought to be
able to hold our own with many
a college. This is another open—
ing for somebody; why not you?

CROSS COUNTRY RUN.

The time is drawing near
when the animal cross country
run will be held in \Vashingtor
Park. This is to advise all who
have ambition along that line to
go‘into training atouce. To win
you’ll have to heat Sutherland
'10 who ran a splendid race last
year and won handily over a big
held, Cassavant ’m beng second.
Talking about opportunities.
why not have a regular track
team here. Again it takes a
man to turn the trick. ‘Don't
think and talk about these things
and their possibilities, remember
deeds count. Look at our
basketball team. Take for your
example a man like h’Taguire ’16
or Pearsall ’17 and do for the
olhcr sports what they did and
are doing for basketball.

LOOKING OVER SITES
FOR ATHLETIC FIELD.
The board of trustees, which.

with Dr. Pnrubachcr as chair—

man. consists of Prof. Risley.

Prof. Sayles. Physical Director

Swaim and John McNeil ’IG,

and that is looking after the

fund started by the class of

1016 which is to buy an athletic

ﬁeld for the college. had a meet—

ing Saturday in which plans
were discussed. After the
meeting the committee looked
over some’prospective sites. but
no deﬁnite action was taken.

The work of the board will be

watched with interest.

 

 

COLLEGE CLUB.

the College Club Friday after"
noon, October 20, at 3 :45. Col-
lege Club is an organization to
which every student ought to

structive as well as interesting
and special speakers are pro-
cured for each meeting. The
