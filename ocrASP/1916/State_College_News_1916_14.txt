VOLJ No. 3

Prospects for B. B. Season Bright
. ~Manager Pearsall Has
Good Schedule

 

State College's big sport,
basketball, will be ushered in on
Friday, when Manager Pcarsall
will hold the annual basketball
tag-day. it is a truly sad feature
of our college life that our team
m'ust‘ be equipped by such means
as. a” tag-day, and it is hoped
that future years ivill bring a
remedy for this evil. However,
a future ideal state of affairs
will not help now, and the best
must be made of present condi~
lions.

Everything is set for the most
successful year in basketball old
State College has ever seen.
The material in men at the dir-
posal of Captain Jones and our
prospective coach is ﬁrst-class
and not'scarce. Three of last
year's regulars are back, Jones
'18, Goewey ’18 and S. Fitz-
gerald ’17, also two other letter-
men, namely I-[ohaus ’17 and
Fitzgerald ’19. Besides these
five men, who alone would make
up a corkingr good combination,
there are many other experienced
players, all eager to make the
big; team. Some capable candi-
dates are represented in Wink-
lot '17, Connors ’17, Cohen '18,
Dcdicke ’18, Gi'ecnblatt ’18, Van
Dcrworker '18, Carr '19, Mason
’19, Cassava11_t,'19”and Miller
‘19, who was a star. at the Al-
bany High a few years ago.
The Freshmen have some very
promising men, but, of course,
it is impossible at this early date
to know anything definite about
the abilityof any individuals.
The call for practice will be out
within a week and a record-
breaking squad is expected to
answer.

.-1\'lanager Pcarsall has been
able to secure the Albany l-lig‘h
gym for practice and games.
This is a decided advantage over
last year. when 'iﬁo‘s’t'of‘the prac-
ticing had to be done in em own.
comparatively small gym, which
was by no means proper prepara-

tion for' a game to be played on

the A. H. court.

tions, 15‘ the change" in 'coach“.

NEW YO K. STATE COLLEGE FOR

ALBANY, N.Y., OCTOBER :18. 1916

BASKET BALL TAG—DAY—FRIDAY, OCTOBER 20

Arch Swaim, who has resigned
his position as physical director
here to take up a similar posi-
tion with the Troy public schools,
leaves a vacancy which is to be
filled by a man who is expert in

coaching. Swaim was an ideal
gymnast, but there are those

who believe that his manage-
ment of the teams could be im-
proved upon. Be that as it may,
a new coach is sure to work to
better advantage and the men
are eagerly waiting for the an-
nouncement of the name of the
chosen man. Rumor has it that
one of the Wachtcr brothers of
Troy is to be engaged, which if
true, means an ideal coach, at
least as far as basketball is
concerned. ‘

Manager nest-3511 has ar-
ranged a schedule, the like of
which was never before seen at
State College and which two
years ago would have been
looked upon as an utter impos-
sibility; He should be given
credit for his excellent work,
and above all he should receive
the hearty support of every stu-
dent in the college. So when
Friday comes, do your bit; help
to raise a large amount, for it is
needed to equip the team. The
boys will work hard for you and
the honor of State College all
winter long. Show your appre»
ciation of their services Friday.

 

CHANGE OF FRIDAY

PROF. RISLEY RATED AS “A”
IN SPAULDING'S LIST OF
FOOTBALL OFFICIALS

 

It is irony of fate that we,
who have no football team in
our college, yet can boast of
having a man on our faculty
who is looked upon as an au-
thority on the game throughout
the states. In perusing Spauld-
ing’s Ofﬁcial Football Guide for
1916, we were pleasantly sur-
prised to find Prof. Risley rated
under “A” in the list of ofﬁcial
referees. This is a distinctive
honor. The list of approved
ofﬁcials is given out by the Cen-
tral Board on Ofﬁcials for the
convenience of football man-
agers. The list of eastern
referees includes over ﬁve hun—
dred, of these only about forty
are rated under “A,” and that
Prof. Rislcy is one of the few

justifies us in elassing him -as-

one of the leading referees of
the country, one of the big men
of bootball. Prof. Risley was
in his college days one of the
stars on the Colgate team. He
has in former years ofﬁciated at
many of the big games in the
East, and will undoubtedly be
called upon again this season.
