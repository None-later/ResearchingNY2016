'the committee congratulates itself on having made a perma-
nent agreement with Jesse Smith, ’17, whereby he will take
charge of the Komick Kolyum. judging by his work in the last
issue and in this one, we consider him a valuable addition to our
stall, and hope that his laughing muse will sustain his efforts as
well in the future.

It has been decided to continue the temporary name of this
journal, “ State College News.” Originally we had planned to
make this a four-page paper. The great abundance of material
compelled us to give out six-page editions up to date. Begin—
ning to-day the “News” wrl come out in the size originally
planned. Lack of space com}, elled us to drop much interesting
material. and to avoid this it the future we are planning to
change the size of the paper, making it about ll”x17”, instead
of 10"x 14”, which it is now.

LETTERS T

In reply to the letter sent to
the editor. signed “ Soph,” I
beg to state that the matter
has been deﬁnitely taken up re-
garding the rivalry between
the Freshman and Sophomore
classes.

The suggestion has been made
that the Sophomore class make
2‘!) a so-ealled “ Bulletin of De-
fiance," in which they agree to
meet the Freshman class to de-
termine which lass is superior or
N hOSS'lI

It is, further suggested that

THE. EDITOR

something along the lines of a
Flag Rush be the manner 0
procedure. ‘

if this suggestion is followed
out and it is still the pleasure oi

those concerned that I should

appoint or at least suggest a
committee to carry out the
necessary details, the following
are submitted: Reinhard Hohans
and Joe Sproule. I suggest that
the Junior President also nomi-
nate two husky Juniors.
‘ Respectfully,
SENIOR PRESIDENT.

The Dying Hebrew’a Prayer
Tune: “ Where the River Shannon
F lows."

Where the river Shannon's ﬂowing
Let my korpse in peace repose,
Beneath six feet of the auld sod—
With a shamrock on my nose;

For the devil will be trying
To ﬁnd me, I suppose,

And he‘ll ne'er look for a Hebrew
Where the river Shannon ﬂows.

Gee, that kids klever‘——-but
that isn't all. He’s a man of
sorrow at times and oft cloth he
moralize on subjects which to
less comprehensive intellekts,
would present a formidable
array of multitudinous intri-
cacies. To prove our konten-
Lions, read the weekly proverb,
and observe the maxims by
which he so greatly prospereth
and hath attained such a pin-
nakle of greatness. Lookll

Proverb
A certain Prof. once told me
\'.itl1 a sweet, selfkonscious
blush
That one hair upon the dream-
tank is worth two hairs in the
brush.

 

Gadzooksl thy faithful skribc
lccleth in lyrikal mood to-day.
Nor kan he restrain his splitter-
ing pen from writing an ode to
the Freshman klass. (O thou
great and only Omar! Forgive
me this!)

Ode

I sometimes think that I have never

seen
‘Such fresh as this year's Freshman
lass doth seem;
That every konntenance the lot

possess .
Would make a pie with jealous rage
turn green.

While we're thinking in that
oriental strain let's write a song
‘of fate:

, Kismet!

iOh, “what is written is written,”
‘ And lwrsh-thrs worerwritten, too,
'For I fear me much I have bitten

Oﬁmnro thanJ'm able to chew.
I started to write you a sonnet

ln marvelous metre and rhyme;
Blithcly began‘l upon it,

And not stuck at the second line.
