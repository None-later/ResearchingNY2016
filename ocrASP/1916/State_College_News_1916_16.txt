THE JOSEPH HENRY
, r SOCIETY

The Joseph Henry Society
was organized last February
under the auspices of the Physics
Department. The aim of‘tlie or-
ganization is to gain a in'oadet‘
knowledge and appreciation of
modern scientiﬁc movements
through current scientiﬁc litera—
ture and personal information
from scientiﬁc men.

Though our society is only in
its infancy with no longstanding
traditions. we anticipate a year
of activity which will be a great
source of beneﬁt to each menr
her. It is with delight that we
look forward to welcoming the
several prospective new members
into our society.

Y. W. C. A. RECEPTION
‘ QCT.2oth

 

Rev. Motdenliawer to Speak at
Next Regular Meeting

 

The ﬁrst regular meeting of,
thc‘ Young Woman's Christian
:‘\ssociation was held on Wed-
nesday, October H, in the audi-
torium. Jn order that new-
comers might innlcrstaiid the
work of the V. W., the duties
of each committee of the asso-
ciation were explained by its
respective chairman. Marion
lilodgett, in a talk, invited all
1920 girls to become members
of the Y. W. C. A. Faith Wal-
lace drew a vivid picture of the
many advantages memberships
would bringr in the shape of good
times and wholesome fun.

The Y. W. C. A. will hold
its‘annnal reception on Friday
evening. October 20. The very
large number of students en—
rolled, in the college and the
limited room in the gymnasium
make it an impossibility to
:chomodnte all, much as such a
thing is to be desired. The invi-
tation had to be limited, there-
fore,‘ to‘ include only all Fresh-
men and the members of the
association. All of these should
attend and strive to get ae-
quainted. An excellent program
has been arranged and a pleasant
time is guaranteed. ‘

At the next regular meeting
of the Y. W. a rare treat is to
be offered. The association has
been fortunate enough to secure
the Rev. J. V. Moldenhawer as
a speaker on that occasion. Rev.
Moldcnhawer is widely known as
a very interesting speaker and
he is sure to have a message to
deliver which it will be well
worth your while to hear. It will
be a rally meeting and a large
attendance is requested.

The Y. W. C. A. lunch counter
is open daily. If you have not
yet tried it, do so without fail.
Good lunches are furnished at
reasonable prices.

Students wanting work, and
people wanting workers, are re-
quested to ﬁll out cards in Dean

H. E. DEPARTMENT

The Household Economic stit-

dcnts are advised to keep a per-
sonal account of'money ex-
pended. Therc is a Personal
Account llook which is pub-
lished by the V. \V. C. A. of the
country, which it bought in
dozen lots cost ten cents apiece.
in several of the courses this
year this keepingr of an account
is to be required. One of the
tendencies ot education has
turned toward thrift; the basis
of thrift is account keeping.
. The students will ﬁnd very in—
teresting material in, the Forc-
msl, a magazine which is on
our' magazine table. ‘

Thereis a book now published
called “Efﬁcient Living,” by

which are in the Independent.
