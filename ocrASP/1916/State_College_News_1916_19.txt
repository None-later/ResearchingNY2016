LETTERS TO

[Editor of State Calla/c News:
it is indeed gratifying to see
that the letter of two weeks
ago had some results. Now if
something is done besides
talking about it, everyone will
be more pleased.
At the student assembly last
Friday, Mr. Hohaus spoke in
regard to class rushes. It is
rather difﬁcult to agree with
Mr. l-lohaus in all that he said.
He seemed to look with (lis-
favor upon real scraps and ad-
vocated wrestling matches or
something of that kind. Let’s
get away from pctticoat in-
fluence and'have State College
known ias a men’s school as
well as a women’s school.
Now zit State College, with
its large number of female,
students, it might not he just
proper to be “rude and rough,”
and have a regular scrap. it
is sad indeed to think that the
men should be so influenced by
the female element as to hesi-
tate to indulge in a rush for
fear of spraining a thumb or
something like that. Horrors!
At Yale University the
matter was considered as to the
advisability of allowing the
men to impersonate women in
the college plays. it was
feared that they would become
effcminate.

 

THE EDITOR

With the great ntimher‘of
\vonien here, are we not in
serious danger of' the same
thing?

'l‘hese few observations are
to he taken for their face value.
it is'not the intention to dis-
courage any good work, for
any sort of class rivalry would
be a distinct relief from that
which has existed in the past.

Let us have some action
along with the talk.

”S.\.\ii-: Sorii."

 

Edi/or of State Collar/c News:
Following the suggestion of

the Senior president, that l
nominate two members of the
_lunior Class to assist the mem-
bers of the Senior committee
in carrying out the details in
connection with the Freshmth
Sophomore rivalry. i would
submit the following: Jesse
Jones and Joseph \Valker.

Respectfully,

JUNIOR PRESIDENT.

Notfor nothing did Bean

COLLEGE CLUB.

 

Prof. Risley Speaks on the Spirit
of ’76.

 

The ﬁrst meeting of the Col—
lege Club was held on .li‘riday,
October 20th. Prof. Risley
spoke to the Club on "The
Spirit of ’76." In a town hall
in New England there is a pic-
ture showing the three ages,
Youth, Middle Age, and Old
Age marching onward together
to war. What was it that
animated these men? it was
the spirit of ’76, which had
grown from the philosophy of
the time, a time when people
were thinking about the indi—
vidual rights of men; a time
when the freedom of the press
was beginning to he i‘ccogi
nixed, and it was decided that
"'l‘ruth cannot be liln-leil.“
How much of the spirit of ’70
have we in I916? Could we
draw a picture of the young.
middlemged, and old marching
together to war? What would
force men into action like that
of ’76? Certainly not an em;
phasis on the individual, in»!
the commercial element, not
military training, nor interna—
tionalism. The greatest need
of the people of this country is
self-denial. The Boy Scout
movement is doing a great deal
to encourage self-denial and a
feeling for the rights of others.
The boys have some way of
showing whether they have
done anything for someone
else during the day. it would
he a good thing if all college
students thought of this and
had some way Of reminding
themselves to think of others
and do something for someone
else. in addition to self-denial.
we should cultivate a whole~
sonicness of attitude towards
everything, cleanliness in
everything, in our city and in
our government, and this atti~I
tude should help make us good
citizens. it is by developing
these principles that we can
make the spirit of 1916 as great
and far—reaching as that of ’76.

College Club was fortunate
in having Prof. Risley, its
organizer, an the fll‘lSt speaker.
All those who attended for the
ﬁrst time will want to come
again. VVate‘h the bulletin
board for a notice of the next
meeting!
