it is our sad duty to report
in this, our first, issue the
death of Dr. Leonard A. Blue,
since 1912 the dean of State
College. Dr. Jllue died at 11
o’clock on the morning of
August 18th at his home in
this city. He had been ill but
a few .w‘eelrs, apparently from
a complete breakdown caused
by too close anapplication to
his duties and study.

Dean Jllue was regarded as
one of the leading educators of
the day. He had received a
thorough collegiate training
and was looked upon as an au-
thority on pedagogy. He was
an indefatigable worker, a
zealous student, a man of pro<
found learning and exceptional
ability; as a lecturer and iii-
structor he was brilliant and
scholarly. He was an active
leader in the Trinity M. E.
church and Sunday school and
president of the Trinity Bible
class.

Dean Blue. was a native of
the state of lowa. He received
his early college training at
Cornell, from which institution
he graduated as a Ph. ll. in
1892 and as Ph. M. in 1893.
After leaving Cornell he en-
tered the University of Chicago
as graduate—student. Later he
went to the University of
Pennsylvania. where he was
awarded his Ph. D. in 1902.

'Dr. lllue began his pedago—
gical career in the west as Pro-
fessor of Political and Social
Science in Iowa \Vesleyan Uni-
versity. Later he was made
a Fellow in Political Science.
University of Pennsylvania;
Professor in Morningside Col-
lege, Sioux City, Town; Pro-
fessor in Goucher College;
Fellow by courtesy. Johns
Hopkins University: l'louof-
ary Fellow, Clark University.
and since 1012 Dean of our
own State College for Teach—
ers.

FACULTY

New Head of Commercial
Department.

As is commonly the case this
new college year brings with
it several new faces among the
faculty. The unprecedented
growth of the college during
the last year and the existence
of vacancies .made an ex-
ceptional large number of ap-
pointments necessary, there
being seven new members to
get acquainted with. Hard as
it is for anyone starting in a
new place to adapt himself to
the new conditions and en—
vironment, we are confident

that State College spirit will

soon make all new faculty
members feel at home here,
and like a full—fledged member
of our family.

Miss Mary E. Cobb New
Librarian.

The grinds will soon dis-
cover a new face in the library.
Miss Mary TC. Cobb will be
there daily to look after their
need and that of the library,
and anyone looking over her
experience and preparation
can’t doubt her ﬁtness for that
task. Miss Cobb graduated
from Syracuse University in
1012. whereupon she entered
the New York State Library
School to specialize in library
work, graduating from that in—
stitution in 1914. She gained
her practical experience on the
staff of the New York State
Library 1013—15, and in the
Brooklyn Public Library 1915—
iﬁ. she having had charge in
the last named place of the

History of the College

Crowded College Means That
Scholarship Test May be
Given to all Candidates
for Entrance in
Future.

 

The phenomenal growth of
Statc.C1)llege has received no
checkthis year. On the con-
trary, it seems as if it has
gained added impetus. This
year's entering class has out-
stripped any of former years in
respect to numbers. Up to
Monday morning 330 applica-
tions for entrance had been re-
ceived. and it is a safe guess
that by the time the college has
been opened and classes are
well under way this number
will have been far surpassed.
A remarkable feature, and one
that comes as a good omen, is
the presence of over 60 men
among ‘the candidates for
entrance The proportion of the
men in the college has been
growing steadily with every
new class. From about 10 to 1
in the girls' favor only a very
few years ago, it has now
reached the 5 to 1 mark. There
are now in State College stu—
(lcntsfrom every county in the
state and our number of stu~
dents trot: other states is also
increasing as well as the unin—
ber of the states represented
here. At present there are
people enrolled .lrom Massa-
chusetts, Vermont, Pennsyl-
vania,’New Jersey. Maryland.
Connecticut, and Michigan.

While this ever increasing
influx of new students is evi-
dence of the good reputation
our college is enjoying and a
ﬂattering testimonial to its ex—
cellentmanagement and its effi-
cient faculty, and as such
should be welcomed, yet it is
rapidly bringing on a serious
problem, which to cope with,
the authorities have already
made plans. That is the
*problem ' of aecomodating a
studentbody that is fast out-
‘growing 'its present quarters.
The trustees of the college are
hoping to add more land to the
college grounds and to enlarge.
'in that way, building facilities.
‘ln the meantime. however,'Dr.
Brubacher is introducing. in an
