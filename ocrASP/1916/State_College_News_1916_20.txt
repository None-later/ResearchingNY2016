in order to get the best out of

undivided support of the stu
dent-2. Not only is the money
needed which their attendance
at the games would bring, but
also the helpful cheering of a

to the 'l‘ag—l )ay fund.

The last speaker was Rein-

llohaus asked that the present
classes get away from the cha-

planned and supervised series
of contests, these contests to he

which seemed to find much
favor with the audience, was

team would be drawn into the
lake.
