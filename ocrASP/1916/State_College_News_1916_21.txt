PRATT INSTITUTE ART
" EXHIBIT.

Saturday morning, the Art
Department ‘opened the Pratt
Institute Ex'hibit of ant work,
done by students. Entering
Miss Perine’s room, one sees
the work done in the ﬁrst and
second year of designwthe
use of charcoal, water-colors,
and the {combination of the
two, ending with the more
complicated designs of stain-
glass windows. These are par-
ticularly interesting.

Pen sketching, and the
water—color and charcoal coin-
bination, make the section in
magazine illustration a lively
rival for admiration. An illus-
tration for ” Hiawatha.” in par-
ticular, draws the attention.

The poster work is exceed—
ineg attractive, and shows
cleverness as well as artistic
talent.

The water—color representa-
tions of Ilmvers ~— roses. chrys—
anthemums, dahlias, and others,
made one wish to stay longer,
and admire the beauty and
splendid technique of the work.
The pictures in oils Were tine.

" Pratt " can be justly proud
of this exhibit.

MEETING OF NORMAL
SCHOOL PRINCIPALS
WITH PRES. BRU-
BACHER.

Last Thursday President
ltrubacher called a meeting in
his ofﬁce of a number of Nor-
mal School principals who were
in town. The purpose of the
meeting was the seeking of a
more satisfactory set of rules
governing the entrance of Nor-
mal School graduates into State
College. The discussion cov—
ered three things:

I. The relation between the
entrance requirements of both
the Normal Schools and State
College for Teachers.

2. The credit properly to be
assigned to a graduate of a
Normal School upon his en—
trance into State College.

3. The relative value to be
placed upon the academic and
the professional work accom-
lished by a Normal School
graduate.

The meeting was a very in-
terestng one and will probably
result in slight modiﬁcations
of the respective rules in next
year’s catalogue.

Last Saturday the lease was
signed for the practice house
for the H. E. Department. The
house is situated at 429 Wash~
ington avenue.
