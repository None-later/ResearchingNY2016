A WEEKLY JOURNAL
VOL. I No. 5

MR. SAMUEL G. LANDON
SPOKE ON LIFE
INSURANCE.

.___.
Gave Introduction to a Series of
Lectures on Same Subject.

in the auditorium Friday
morning Mr. Landon gave the
first of a series of lectures on
life insurance. Mr. Landon,
who is an able speaker. called
the students’ attention to the
responsibilities they will face
when they go out to teach.
How they will work hard and
learn to sacrifice for those
given into their care. When
that stage is r :ached everyone
should realize how great was
the care and the responsibility
embodied in his own educa~
tion, and that he is under
great obligation to someone.
The responsibility of wiping
out that obligation should be—
come a blessed privilege to all.
The surest way to guarantee
the successful carrying out of
the repayment of so important
a debt is through life instit—
ance. Life insurance to-day
means saving money. No
matter how much money you
pay for a policy. it is returned
to you or yours before, or after
your death. Mr. Landon said
he believed the teachers’ pen—
sion to be a fine thing when
resting on a firm foundation,
but only as far as it goes. for it
provides for this life only and
not for those who depended
upon you while you were
living. ~.

ALBANY, N.Y., Novcunea 1, 1916 '

CROSS COUNTRY RUN.
Friday, November 3d.

The cross eotmtry run this
year bids lair to outdo all
former races by far. The
earnestness displayed by the
various men in training shows
they mean business and keen
competition is assured. it is
this year harder than ever to
predict: the winner. Suther-
land ’tg) has been running Ill
good form, but faces the dan—
ger of gt.)iiig stale unless he
shortens his daily routine of
training. L'assavant '19 seems
determined to make good, and
judging by his last year’s per—
formanrc, when he entered ills
prepared and finished second,
he. stands a good chance.
Ludwig ’2o looms up as a
strong contender who will
seriously have to be reckoned
with. Zcilman ’19 has all the
stamina in the world and may
spring a surprise, though the
hill near the finish will in all
probability give him much
trouble. Harrigan ’19 and
(lreenblatt ’18 have both gone
around the lake in good shape
lately and should do much
better than last year, espe-
cially the former. who up to
the last half mile was the
leader last year. After all it
is almost impossible to predict
the winner as so many dark
horses are entered. However.
it is sure that he who wins the
cup will have defeated a
tough squad of runners.

The race will take place at
5 o'clock Friday afternoon,
November 3d. and it will pay
everybody to be out along the.
course to watch the race.

class teams, in swimming,
basketball and baseball. For
four years he was a member of
the Amherst track team and
during the last. three years
