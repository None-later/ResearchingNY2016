LETTERS Torsional:

college functions and their
pleasures, are deprived of
those privileges and pleasures.

Is there not some means of
keeping this crowd from our
midst, so that our college peo-
ple may be able to enjoy our
college functions? i would
suggest that tickets be given
out for these receptions, and
that these tickets be required
for entrance into the gymnas-
ium at such times.

Let us hope that the pro-
moters of the reception which
is to be held November 3, will
seriously consider this sugges-
tion. and hence do away with
such a mob of outside pleasure
seekers as the Committee of
the Senior reception was con-
fronted with. A Senior.

 

ADMISSION TO JUNIOR-
FRESHMEN FROLIC
TO BE BY TICKET.

"in a joint—meeting of the
Social Committee of the
Faculty and that of the Junior
Class with President [tru-
bachcr, it was decided that the
admission to the Junior—Fresh—
men Frolic .on Friday evening
should be by ticket only.
These tickets can be secured
by members of the Junior and
Freshmen classes and are good
only for the admission of
bearer and one friend, this
friend being any‘body the
bearer of the ticket wishes to
designate. The name of the
classmcmber and of her or his

 

 

guest must be written upon
the card. Absolutely no one
without a ticket will be ad-
mitted to the lfrolic. This
action was made necessary by
the shameful way in which the
hospitality of the classes has
been abused at former affairs,
especially by outsiders.

COLLEGE GLEE CLUB.

A glee club is being,r organ-
ized by Dr. 'l‘hompson, which
bidsfair to become one of the
mosli flourishing organizations
in the College. Already a
large number of men have
been tried out and about thirty
have been accepted, if you
are interested see Dr. Thomp-
son.
