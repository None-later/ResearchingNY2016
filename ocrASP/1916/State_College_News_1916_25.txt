SENIOR'RECEPTION
A SUCCESS.

The reception given by the
Seniors to the Freshmen and
Faculty Friday evening, was a
great success. The gym 'was
decorated in keeping with the
linllowe'en spirit with corn»
stalks and pumpkins and the
lights dimmed with red, the

r9|7 class color.
Zita’s Orchestra furnished

music for the occasion. The
only unpleasant feature was
the crowded condition on the
liner, it being almost impos-
sible to (lance in‘comfort. The
committee in charge of the
affair consisted of Reinhard
llohaus., James \Valker, Caro-
line l‘tennett, and Bessie Staats.
