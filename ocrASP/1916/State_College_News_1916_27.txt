PROF. WOODARD AD-
DRESSES COLLEGE
CLUB.

 

Topic is “ Flowers."

 

The regular meeting of Col—
lege Club was held last Friday
afternoon at 3.45. The speaker
was l’rof. Woodard and his
topic was “ Collecting Flow-
crs.”

Mr. Woodard began his talk
by describing his summer va»

cation, which he Spent in
traveling through Mass,

Conn., New York, New Jersey,
and Long island on a search
for new varieties of flowers
and plants. lie was successful
in obtainingr some 300 speci—
mens, some of which were
shown. greatly adding to the
interest of the lecture. Some
dismay was evident among" the
audience as certain formidable
Latin names were announced.
but when a strange term
proved to be merely the famil—
iar blueberry, the bewildered
looks gradually vanished.

Among the various speci-
mens shown, a large number
were of interest because of
their economic value—alfalfa,
wild indigo, flax, bayberry—a
plant from which the familiar
bayberry candles are inade—
and many others.

Prof. Woodward then pro—
ceeded to describe the tools
used, methods of mounting and
methods of classification. One
of the most essential objects in
Mr. \Voodard’s vacnlum was
a lunch—chiefly composed of
“ (log biscuits.”

Mr. Woodard concluded his
talk by advising everyone to
get a hobby—something for
which he worked for sheer love
of the thing and not for the
compensation received—even
if one became like a tranmp in
the attempt——one who dis-
carded all the conventions of
society which the law allows
him to and forgets compensa~
tion in the delight of living a
free life. “ But above all," was
the ﬁnal advice, “go below the
surface if you would ﬁnd any-
thianr worth while.”

The speaker next week will
be the Rev. Mr. Moldenltawer.
His subject will be announced
later.

PROF. RISLEY WRITES
ON INTERNATIONAL
LAW'.

 

Head of History Dept. Says Pres-
ent Conﬂict is the Result
of Public Opinion.

 

is there such a subject as
international Law? asks Prof.
A. W. Risley in a very inter-
esting and illuminating article
in the October issue of the
journal of the New York State
’l’caehcrs' Asso. Mr. Risley
answers his own question by
proving in a very clear and
concise manner that interna—
tional Law not only still exists.
but that never before was
knowledge Of it so widespread
and appreciated.

He goes very carefully into
the details of his subject, ex-
plaining such termsand prob-
lems as Neutralization, Neu-
trality, Neutral Commerce,
Right of Search, Contraband,
intervention, and Good Ofﬁces.
This  done with the same
force and vivacity with which
he handles European History
and when through he has made
his complicated subjects as
clear and fascinating as the
Reign Of Louis XIII in famous
History II. The reason for
this is that ‘Mr. Risley has the
faculty Of saying a great deal
in a very few words. as Shown
by the following: “ The main

reason why neutralization is

Sutherland ’19 Wins Cross Country [is '

Establishes New Record for
Co rse.

The annual cross country
run was successfully held last
Friday afternoon at the sched—
uled time, 4.30 l-’. M. The race
was run under fair conditions,
the going being good and the
weather satisfactory. A little
before the appointed time nine
men faced Mr. J‘lubbard at the
start. All of the contestants
were trained to the minute and
presented a line picture of
health. With the crack of the
pictol Sutherland took the lead
in a spurt that carried him to
the first turn in thirty seconds,
remarkable time for so difﬁcult
a race. Dewitt 'l‘ownsend fol—
lowed elosely behind with the
rest of the men in hot pursuit.
Down the hill and around the
east end of the lake 'l‘ownsend
closed in and the quarter mile
mark was passed with the
junior only a stride behind the
’19 man, with l'larrigan ’19,, a
good third, but apparently
runningr under difﬁculties. The

position of the ﬁrst two had
nOt changed as the runners
passed the half mile mark, but
l—larrigan was here closely
pressed by 'Cassavant and Lob-
dell. The latter especially was
running strongr and soon over-
took both Cassavant and Har-
rigan, who was dropping back,
so that at the three—quarter
mile mark Lobdell was third,
Cassavant fourth and l'larri—
gan fifth. All men held these
positions at the mile point near
the lake house, but here
Sutherland began to draw
away from Townsend, in a
beautiful spurt up the hill.
Lobdell was coming strong,
but was unable to make up the
gap of about ﬁfty yards which
the early sprinting 0f the lead-
int;r pair had opened. Suther-
land ’19 crossed the finishing
line in the very good time of
5 min. 171/5 see. This is a
new record for the course.
'l‘ownsend ’18 was second, his
time being 5.333/5. Lobdell

FIRST FOOTBALL WORK-

 

Coach Hubbard Gave Good Sized
Squad Valuable Instruction.

 

Football got its
State College last Saturday
morningr when about twenty
men met Coach l'lubbard at
lx‘idgefield Park to receive their
first instruction in the sport.
This response to the call for
men is very encouragingr and
it is beginning to look as if a
team will become a reality
here. It was the ﬁrst oppor-
tunity many of the men had to
get acquainted with Mr. Hub-
bard, especially in a profes—
sional way, and the consensus
of opinion was most favorable.
The men were given instruc-
tions in the rudiments of the
game and a lot of preliminary
practice was indulged in,
Coach Hubbard showing the
men the best way in which to
throw the ball for a pass, to
recover a lost ball. and to hold
the ball while advancing. lie
also explained the duties of
each player and various posi-

 

start in .

 

tions and plays were illus—
trated in practice. In all the
work—out was most profitable
and many of the men learned
more from that morning’s
work than they had ever hoped
to know about football.
Practice will be held as often
as possible during the next two
or three weeks, and every man
should come out. It’s a won-
derful time out in the open.
Among the men taking part
in Saturday’s work—out were
l-lohaus ’16, ‘Cassavant ’19, D.
Townsend ’18, Dedicke ’18, R.
Townsch ’18, Springman ’20,
Lobdell ’20, Case ’19. Hoffman
’20, Schneider ’20. Cotton ’29,
Bliss '20.
