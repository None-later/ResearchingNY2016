COACH WACHTER IN
CHARGE.

 

Basketball is fast hitting its
stride and will soon be going
along at full speed. The ac-
quisition of Ed. VVachter as
coach, which was announced in

‘last week’s issue. has put new

life into the men with the re—
snlt that they are working

harder than ever and with a de-

gree of determination and com
ﬁdencc never 'before attained.
Anyone at all familiar with
basketball conditions in the

country knows the VVachter,
brothers. For years they were‘

the mainstay of the Champion
Troy five, the team that»re-

pcatedly won the State League-
championship and also that of
the world. A few seasons ago,
Coach Wachter took part in at
barn-stormingr trip which can)

ried the Troy team far into the
middle West and which estab-

lished, without question, the'
superiority of that aggregation

over any other ﬁve in the land.
Coach Wachter brings to State
College the experience gained

in hundreds of games played in:
the fastest of company and the,
‘aid of his generalship and

training, together with the
prestige of his name, ought to
do much towards placing the
Purple and Gold up among the
leading college ﬁves of the

country. . I

will and active response on the
part of the student body that
it is hardly necessary to add
much hereto the plea made by

Pcarsall at the student meeting

last Friday. The classes are
taxing the members twenty-

ﬁvc cents each, this contri’bu-‘

tion to go to the treasury of
the basketball management.

Up to the time of this writ--

ing the Juniors and'Freshmcn
had taken action on the matter

and were already busy collect?

ing the fees. The Seniors and

Sophomores were expected to
take similar action at their next.

meeting. No one should dodge
this tax, but look upon it
rather as a privilege.

PROFESSOR KIRTLAND>

TO GIVE WEEKLY
RECITAL.

Everyone who has ever had
the pleasure of hearing Pro-
lessor Kirtland in a song re-.

cital will receive with gratifica—
tion his announcement that he

noons of each week. The pro—
gram will be selected and will

cussing of interesting poems
and lyrics and the rendition of
songs. Everybody who possi-

bly can be there, especially all‘

Freshmen, are cordially invited
to be present. Herc is a rare
opportunity to hear an {mooni-
plished artist, and you’ll be the
better for having heard him.

Our Weekly Proverb.
Uneasy lies the tooth that
wears a krown. -
(This proverb is an example
of Bean Swift’s loftier style,
written in the golden autumn
of his glory, when all his
teeth were gone.)
Notice: Pair 0’ Dice Lost.
Once I dreamed I went to
heaven, '
The reason was, you see,
'l‘hat I passed the pearly por-

 

tals
For one who looked like me.
And I heard a rag-time
rhythm

“Floating to me from afar—
(“Yaaka Hula Hickey Dula”)
On a heavenly guitar.

Not a sign of toil or textbooks
From the ceiling to the floor,

And in every nook I stumbled
O’er a golden kuspidor.

And I yelled in high elation;
llut no ccho reached my car.
“ This is heaven,” read a sign-
board,
“And-you'll ﬁnd no ‘Echo’

here."
So [ went below to ﬁnd it,
Down in Pluto’s dreary
home;
Where a shore of praktice
teachers
Were instructing blocks of
stone.

And a skorc or more of kritiks‘

Were methods
new
Through a haze of burning
brimstouc
\‘thrc their notes were read
———-and blue!

suggesting

There was an H.  Depart—
ment
And i shuddeer as I looked,
The poor girls there had to live
on
What they themselves had
cooked.

Charles kept the cook stove

going,
("l'was a good thing that he
did,
Or else Dixon would have
taken
A siesta on the lid.)
Johnny .lccker’s ghost was
singing

’Ncath a sulphurous canopy:

' “When the sun goes down in

Delmar.
Life begins in Albany.”

And I went into a gym klass
Of Arch Swaim, lately dc-
ceased,
(Now I've

heard “ nilnisi

 

'bonum,”

 

 

it

Should ‘be said, do
mortuis.”)
But his task was getting Fresh-
men '

(Whose numbers had in~
kreased)
To akquire the art of klim‘bing
Up some poles but lately
‘greased. '

Archie ordered me to try it,
And the" pole beneath me
broke
And out of bed, upon my head
I thankfully awolu.

THE PRESS CLUB

 

Organizes With Over Thirty
Members.
On

Wednesday afternoon,
with the briefcst advance no-
tice. the Press Club was organ-
ized by Professor l—[astings and
those students who were able
to meet him at the hour as—
signed. Professor *l'lastings
outlined the purpose of the
club as threefold: (I) to furnish
news concerning the college to
the newspapers; (2) to regu—
late the student publications of
the college through coopera-
tion of their editors; (3) to
give instruction in practical
journalism to all who have an
interest in writing.

Many other students, who
could not attend the ﬁrst meet—
ing, have expressed their in—
terest and expect to join the
club. Immediately after elec—
tion, when the papers are less
pressed for space, the club
hopes to begin its work.
Meanwhile Professor Hastings
expects to lay the plans for
organizing the means for secur—
ing college news effectively
and for communicating it to
the papers. He is anxious to
talk with all students who wish
to have a share in the venture,
and is keeping special ofﬁce
hours for this purpose. These
hours are posted on the bulle—
tin board.
