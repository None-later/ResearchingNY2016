ever entered into, is protection,

to the guaranteeing state
rather than to the guaranteed

state,” the "object of war is_

not directly to kill as many of
the enemy as possible, but to
establish permanent peace.”
Neutrals are like the servants
in Moliere’s comedies, with
their backs always turned
ready for a rain of blows.” In
speaking of the United States
and disarmament, he sums
up the case thus, “ Surely
Samson shorn would he power—
less."

His conclusion is a strong,r

point for education and the

training of public opinion.
“The present conflict is the
result of public opinion. No
other prevention offers than
the growth of public opinion.
To awaken it from its perverse
course. a shock is needed and
the very war that is the result
of public opinion will furnish
the shock that will
make future wars impossible
if anything can accomplish
such a longed—for consumma-
tion.” It is too bad, for the
good of our country, that the

money spent in the present
Presidential campaign for
biased political advertising.

could not instead ‘be used to
place this article in the hands
of every voter. As this is im-
possible, every student of State
College should consider it his
duty to give it careful study
that he may be able, as a
teacher, to disseminate not
only the important facts it
contains, but also the spirit of
fairness and justice in which
it is Written.

THE ART OF THE
DANCER.

Alone; with the great interest
that is beingr aroused all over
America for the development
of a higher art in Classic Danc-
ing, comes the announcement
that right in our midst Miss
jack Wilbur and Mr. idwyn
Jolmstone will meet all those
of the student body who like to
dance. at 4.30 p. m. on Thurs-
day, November 9th, in the col—
lege gymnasium. lMiss Wil-
bur and Mr. Johnstonc are
known to the State College in
connection with the produc—
tion of Shakespcarian Dances
last year. They also lectured
on Modern 'l‘endencies of the
Social Dance and taught a
Saturday Night Class in the
gymnasium. It is their desire
to briug'before the students the
immense beneﬁt derived from
the careful consideration of
both the Classic and the Social
Dance. The matter of the
foram-tion of classes to be held
in the gymnasium in accord-
ance with the schedule and pri-
vate instruction will be taken
up this afternoon. This is an
excellent opportunity for the
training of numbers for the
class programs of the year,
eliminating the necessity of

crowding an extra lot of wOric

in a few days before such
events. There is also poise
without grace and step-work
without form in the Social
Dance of to-day, grave errors
worthy the attention of the
most adept students of the art.
All those who dance, as well as
those who desire to dance
better, will promote interest in
dancing: by attending the meet-
in}: this afternoon, with Miss
Wilbur and Mr. Johnstone,
