FORMED,

F m Twu Games;

An InterclaSS Basketball
League has been formed and
games are to be played every
Monday and Wednesday after~
noon all winter long. In this
way the championship will not
be decided‘by one game, as in
former years. The ﬁrst game
was played last Monday when

the Juniors defeated the
Seniors Iby'a score of 38-8.
This large score was due

mainly to the fact that the
Seniors played with only four
men. Before the game Dedicke
was elected captain of the
Junior ﬁve. Cohen was the
principal scorer, making twenty
of his team’s points.

On Wednesday afternoon
the Fresh beat the Seniors
399 in an exhibition game.
The league game was forfeited
by the Seniors, as they were
unable to put a team on the
floor. The Freshmen then de-
feated a combination team.
The 1920 ﬁve worked well, the
work of Springman and Peck-
ham on the ﬂoor being par—
ticularly brilliant. IColton. who
played only one half, is very
fast and a quick shot. VVelI-
worth and Merchant also are
good men.

’20 was third in 545. Every
man who started finished, the
others coming in the following
order: 4, Cassavant ’19; 5,
Harrigan '19; 6, Zeilman ’19;

7, Merchant ’20; 8, Greenblatt‘

’18; 9, Wren ’20.

The fact that all starters
ﬁnished the race speaks well
for Coach Hubbard’s
which he rigorously enforced.
that no man be allowed to
enter the case without ﬁrst
undergoing a thorough medical
examination. Last year only
about half of the
ﬁnished and one of those who
did became violently ill. This
year no contestant felt any ill
effects from the race. As a
ﬁrst and second prize silver
cup will be awarded the win-
ners by the Men's A, A. in the
near future.
