GOOD WORK DONE IN
GERMAN DEPART-
MENT.

100 Per Cent of Those Majoring
Secured Positions Last June.
In an interview with Pro-

lessor Decker, the head of the

German department. one of our

reporters brought out some

very good reasons why every—
body who can possibly do so
should take up German as
major subject. in the first
place, from the all important
dollars and cents view point, it
ought to ‘be a great inducement
to any student to follow up
('icrman, when he or she knows
that last June one hundred per
cent of all those majoringin the
department secured positirms,
and most of them with a good
sized salary. Under present
t‘tlllflll'lt.)llS a position can al—
most be guaranteed to any stu-
dent successfully completing
the work required in the col—
lege ctn'riL‘ulum for a Major in
fierman. As a matter of fact
there are at the present time
two requests for German
teachers which cannot be filled
for lack of candidates. One of
these openings is in one of the
largest high schools in the

State.

The trend in Modern Lan-
guage Work in recent years has
been towards placing a greater
emphasis on oral work, and the
importance of spoken language
has been recognized by the
State Department which now
gives. every year, an examina—
tion for oral credit. \Vhilc it is
not exactly impossible to ob—
tain any position as modern
language teacher without hav-
ing secured this oral credit, yet
it is a fact that all positions

SEATING PLAN FOR
CHAPEL MEETINGS
ON FRIDAYS.
Friday morning Miss Pierce
explained to the student body
the plan by means of which the
seating problem in the audi—
torium has been solved. About
the. plan in general Miss Pierce
said that it must be put into
operation before it could be

known how successful it is.

The fact that the men will not
be together ought not to
weaken the cheering, but that
the girls should loin heartily in

’the cheering and singing.

There are ill the student
body llO more than there are
seals in the auditorium. There-
fore one or two extras had to
be assigned to each row. if a
row is found fullv occupied,

Football is here! The
longed-for sport was success—
fully ushercd into State Col—
lege life Saturday afternoon,
when, for the first time in the
history of the college. two
teams made up of S. C. stu-
dents met on the gridiron.
The game came as the re—
sult of a long carried-on agita-
tion in the sport’s behalf on the
part of some of the student
body and Faculty, because of
the work in that direction by
Alfanager flohaus and above
all, through the aggressive
leadership of Coach ‘f‘l'ubhard.

The game was, of course, no
masterpiece, but in spite of the
inexperience of some of the
men it was fairly fast and well
played. It was really not as
one-sided as the score would
indicate and except when Jesse
,fones tore away with the ball
for long runs, the Freshmen
field their opponents quite
even. in the first quarter,
after the Freshmen had reached
the Upper Classmcn's 20 yard
line by strong consistent play—
ing, Jones carried the ball on
an 80 yard run for a touch-
down, kicking the goal there-
after. 'l‘he second period re-
sulted in no change of the
score. In the third period
Jones again went through on a
long run after catching a punt,
but was downed on the Fresh—
mcn’s5 yard line. On the next
play Fitzgerald carried the ball
across the line on an end run.
Jones failed to kick the goal.
in the fourth quarter Jones
took the ball on a 45 yard run
and with good interference suc-
ceeded in making another
touchdown. He also kicked
the goal, bringing the score up
to 20:0. In the last two min—
utes of play Burns, the left end
of the Upperclassmcn was hurt
and had to be helped off the
field. He has recovered, how-
ever, and will the out to take
part in next Saturday’s game
between the Upperclassmen
and the Sophomores. The
game will be played in the
afternoon.
