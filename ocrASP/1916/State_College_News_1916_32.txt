To the Students of State Col-
lege:

In the past history of our in-
stitution the athletic world has
never been set on ﬁre by the
cheering of our student organi-
zation. It is true that the spirit
has shown itself in cheering
our various teams to victory,
but every year sees some
change taking place, thus ne—
cessitating the learning of new
cheers.

This year it is to be the aim
of the writer to gather together
a collection of cheers which
will put State College within
the foremost rank. It cannot
be done by individual effOrt of
your cheer leader, but must
come from the Student organi—
zation. What we need is some
short, snappy yell. 'Cheers
which, when heard, will bring
back old memories of College
days—campus life, and pic-

turcs of athletic games won by
the spirit of our organization.

80 it is to each one of you
that I appeal. You have your
College "News" which will
gladly publish all cheers sub.
mitted to them. Let us have
an inﬂux of College yells. Let
us make the walls of the gym-
nasium ring with our renewed
efforts.

Show your college spirit by
at least submitting one cheer
and then as they are presented
to their organization as their
yells, to the college as their
cheers, learn them, and give
them with all the vim and vigor
of a true State College student.

Again let me make this
earnest appeal for support and
trust that your Ihearty coopera-
tion may be given in the effort
of making State College noted
for its cheering. \

E. PUD‘ER-BAUGH,
Cheer Leader.

 

INDUSTRIAL CLUB FORMED
Continued from Page 1
the Faculty viewpoint Profes—
sor Douglass said that an In-
dustrial Club would be heartily

supported.

The men of the department
showed much enthusiasm over
the prospects of organization.

Fitzgerald ’ ’17 was chosen
temporary chairman and Van

Der Warker ’18 temporary'

secretary. A committee con-
sisting of the two men men—
tioned and Pattinson ’17, was
appointed to recommend a con-
stitution for the club. Sproule
’17, Wheeler ’17, and Spring—
man ’20 were appointed as
temporary program committee.
The chairman gave an cxtcm-
poraneous talk on the object

 

and probable policies of the In—
dustrial :Club. The meeting
was then adjourned until Mon-
day, Nov. 20, 4:35 P. M. It is
important that every man of
the Industrial Department be
present at the next meeting,
when a permanent organiza—
tion will be formed.

SENIOR MEETING.

At the Senior class meeting
held last \Vednesday, it was
voted that each member should
pay the $.25 assessment toward
the coach fund. The photo—
graph and snap shot of each
member must be submitted to
the committee before the end of
this week if they are to appear
in the Pcdagogue.

They‘d think they’d have a treat.

But they'd leave the table hungry—
For he is too tough to eat.

It’s history to learn, ‘ _ ’

He ought to get away wrth 1t-—-
For he is too green to burn.

THE SONG OF SONGS.
“ Dulce est desipere in loco.”

Hearken ye unto the litany of
the Freshman (which he chan—
teth in secret).

” 0 why do ye mock me ye
Sophomores, and ye that be
Juniors or Seniors? What
grievous sin is it that I have
done? Whercin have I of—
fended in thy sight? Lo, why
do ye smile on hearing the
words of my mouth and upon
seeing my form, why make ye
jest among yourselves? Am I
not fair in thy sight, that I ﬁnd
not favor in thine eyes—is it
that my feet remind the learned
over of those things which ﬂoat
upon the artiﬁcial water ways?
0 why should ye despise me
for that my breath could run a
flivvcr and for that in mine eye
lurketh all the mordant pathos
of a (lying duck?” Thus do I
commune with myself in
silence until my spirit rebellcth
within me and prompeth me to
say, “ 0 ye Seniors, what mean
ye that ye speak of teaching as
that which fulﬁllcth thy ‘lofty
ideals?’ For in thine heart
thou hast said ‘Lo, we teach
for that it insureth the posses-
sion of mcaltickcts.’ 0 ye
Juniors, what mean ye, that ye
say, ‘ Lo, we be humble.’ Doth
not thy conscience arise and
smite thee, saying, ‘Lo, thou
art 'weak?’ 0 ye Sophs, hyp-
ocrites! for that ye cannot
countenance a class rush, why
say ye that ‘ye ancient custom
is undigniﬁed?’ Doth not a
still. small voice assail thine
cars in the watches of the night
and upbraid thee, saying, ‘Lo,
thou art afraid,’ and at the
prospect. doth not thy knees
smite together? Thus do I
commune in solitude till the
clay returneth and the dread
prospect of an 8:10 class
such mutterings
from my heart—but mark ye
well, ye upperclassmen: we be
in number as the sands of the
sea and in strength, as the
breath of much garlic and for
that revenge lurkcth ever with-
in _ the bosom of our sport

shirts—some day shall our,

wrath :burst forth upon thee
with all the fury of a quizz in
History 2—wit‘h results alike
in mortality.

' “The Teacher as Dogmatist."

 

At the meeting of the College
Club on November ID, the
speaker was the Rev. Mr. J. V.
Moldenhawer, who is already
known to many students by the
kind interest he has taken in
College Club.

Mr. iMoldcnhawcr’s subject
was “The Teacher as Dogmat-
ist.”

The speaker said that we are
swinging too far from the old
dogmatic standards of learning.
The aim of modern educators
is the self—evolution of the
pupiI—-the gradual unfolding
of the youthful mind. The old-
fashioned educator, with his
ﬁxed and narrow circle of learn-
ing, is held in contempt to-(lay.

While this new system has
its advantages, it must be
recognized that it is not all~
sufﬁcient for complete educa—
tion. The fundamentals of
knowledge must be learned;
hence the necessity of some-
thing like a deﬁnite and correct
fund of information on the part
of the teacher.

The high school graduate
should show an intelligent
knowledge of the English lan-
guage. he should be able to
read and write correct English;
yet few such students of to-day
can do this, owing to a lack of
deﬁnite training

Youth will always respond,
where it ﬁnds intelligent guid—
ance.

The teacher of tomorrow
should the a dogmatist with the
ﬁxed training of the old school,
plus a wider and more sympa—
thetic knowledge that will ﬁll
the higher needs of the pupil.

College Club promises an in—
teresting speaker at its next
meeting.

PROF. KIRTLAND
GAVE RECITAL

 

On Monday afternoon Prof.
Kirtland gave a very pleasing
recital in the auditorium, which
was attended by a large number
of students. Prof. Kirtland will
not be able to give recitals every
week, as was announced in last
week’s News, but will have to
limit them to fewer occasions.
An announcement of the next rc—
cital will be given. It is hoped
that it will be soon,

Miss Pauline Mandigo, who
has charge of the Home Econo~
mics Page in the Knickerbocker
Press, has entered the Depart—
ment to take up some special
work this year.
