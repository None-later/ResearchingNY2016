worth while are ﬁlled only, or
preferably, with candidates
who have successfully taken
the State test. It is one of the
objects of our German depart-
ment to prepare its students
for that test which is given an—
nually here in the college. Of
how successful the department
has been in this can be seen
from last year’s results, when
over ninety per cent of all who
tried, passed the examination
All but one of those who passed
had a mark of over seventy, and
all, as was stated before, se-
cured good positions. This is a
remarkable record when com—
pared with what the members
of other colleges did. The ex—
act ﬁgures could not be found,
but it is known that the num—
ber of institutions which sc-
cured a better than ﬁfty per
cent passing grade is very
small, if there be any, which
speaks much for the methods
used in the German department
of State College. There are
those who think the work
somewhat difﬁcult, but they are
fonul in all branches of college
111K. in all walks of life. “ The
Oral examination is no cinch.”
one girl put it, ” but when one
is here a year or two and has
developed a greater sense ol re-
sponsibility and realizes that
the examination is a key to
some good position, one gladly
does the work necessary to pre-
pare and not only ﬁnds it easy,

but pleasant as well.”

Students who are chosing
their Majors and Minors
should seriously consider Ger-
man; it would pay.
