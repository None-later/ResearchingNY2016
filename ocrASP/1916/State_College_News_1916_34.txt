Team. , Won. Lost. Perct.
“‘Sophomores .  2 0 1,000
'*Juniors ..  2 1 .666
“Freshmen . .  1 2 .333

Seniors........’ 0 2 .000

The above standing includes

a game in which the Sophs de-
feated the Freshmen early in
the season before Coach Hub-
bard arrived and before the
present schedule went into
effect. The Sophs claim credit
for the game, whereas the other
teams want that contest thrown
out as was done with a later
contest: betweui the Juniors
and Seniors. The protest is
being eonsidt cd by the ex-
ecutive commi..ce of the Men’s
A. A.

Last Monday afternoon the
,luniors had to forfeit a game to
the Sophomores because some
of their men were unavoidably
absent. in that they had to go
home to vote. The matter of
whether a postponement of the
game should have been granted
under those circumstances is
also being,r decided by the ex—
ecutive committee.

JUNIORS BEAT
FRESHMEN 15:11

 

On Wednesday afternoon the
Juniors defeated the Freshmen
by a score of 15:1! in a game
which was not particularly in-
teresting. The Freshmen
showed by far the betterpass-
work, but had the weight
against them. Cohen was the
star, he making II of the
juniors points.
