THANKSGIVING FIELD
DA

Soph-Frosh Contests Arranged.

ftecause of the one day
’l‘hanksgiving vacation the
committee in charge. of
activities between the lirosh
and Sophs thought that it
would be a line occasion to
hold a, lirosh-Soph Day.

Realizing that it is next to im—
possible to play any games
after a 'l‘hanksgiving dinner,
the committee decided to coin-
menee the games at 10 a. m.
The events will ‘be a relay race
between the two classes. a tug—
of~war. and the main feature of
the day. the football game to
decide the supremacy between
low and logo. Whether there
will be any other events has
not yet been definitely de—
eided.

The games will be held at
lx‘idg‘cfield l'ark. the time as
said before, at to a. m. Ridge?
field is on Partridge street.
about three Ibloeks south of
L\'ladison avenue. Patridg'e
street is four blocks west of
the college. All the college
people who will be in Albany
over 'l‘hanksgiving will be ex—
pected to be present, as not
only will the i11\‘i§,ror:ttiner air
be a good appetizer. but also
good sport will be witnessed.
‘l‘he Sophomore adherents will
be expected to take. north side
of the Field during,r the events.
and the lirosh supporters will
locate themselves on the south

side. This will enable the
classes to have concerted
cheering. and a contest of

cheering ought also to result
from this.

 

CONSTITUTION OF MEN'S
A. A. TO BE REVISED.

 

At a meeting of the Mens’

Athletic Assnctation held on
Tuesday. November I4th,

President Townsend was an-
thorized to appoint a committee
which is to revise the constitu—
tion of the association. This
ancient piece of literature has
been the cause of more trouble
than was good for the A. A.,
and that it is at last: to be re-
vised is indeed good news.
The committee appointed is
made up of three Faculty and
two student members, namely
Professors Risley and Mahar
and Coach Hubbard and Jesse
Jones ’18 and Ernest Pudel‘-
paug‘h ’19. From the work of
this committee the Ibest results
are expected.

The, Sophomores sprang a
big surprise on ISatnrday after-
noon when in a well-played
came they defeated the Upper-
classmen by a score of 9:0.
After the showingr made by the
Upperclassmen last Saturday a
(let-lat for the Sophs was surely
looked for. However, the ab-
sence of Jones and Nolde from
the backfield of the i7—i8 team
and the presence of Cassavant
and .\'olde in the Soplmnmre
line-up threw the scales the
other way. The game this
Saturday wa an improvement
over last week's contest in that

 

ENGINEERS INVITE STU-
DENTS TO LECTURES.

 

Mr. Douglas \‘Vardlop, editor
of “Aerial Age." crave a very
interesting illustrated lecture
on “ Flights in the Air,” belore
the Eastern Society of Engi-
neers at Keeler's, Friday evon—
ine‘. Mr. \\"ardlop traced the
development of the airship
from the earliest attempts at
flyiin‘r to the modern Zeppelins.
He showed the importance of
the airship in the present war
by actual photographs and de-
clared that the German fleet
was saved from destruction at
Jutland only by her Zeppelins
There are at present between
So,ooo-ioo.ooo machines in use

at the front. England has
7,000 men in her aviation

corps; lirance 6,000, and Ger—
many 9.000. Each man has
three ships in England and
France and four in Germany.

This would give England
21,000 planes, France 18.000,
« and Germany 36.000. l‘he

United States has at present
200 and that. in spite of the fact

‘that our own Wright. Brothers

are really the inventors of the
“heavier than air plane.”

Mr. ‘\\f. W. Grifﬁths, of Al-
bany, secretary of the Associa—
tion, informed the “ News”
that there are usually six
lectures held by the Society
each year; three in Albany and
three in Schenectady. He very
kindly extends an invitation to
Professors and students of
State College interested in
aviation or science to attend
these lectures and in order that
they may do so, will hereafter
notify the “News " of the, time
and place of future meetings.

 

the plays executed seemed'
surer and better understood by
the men. Although' the
ground was soft and slippery
not many fumbles were made,
except in many cases when the
forward pass was attempted.
The. contest throughout the
first period showed little ad-
vantage either way. The'play
ebbed up and down the ﬁeld
without coming dangerously
near either goal line and the
quarter curled in a scoreless

tie. The Sophomores made
the only touchdown of the
game in the second quarter

when Cassavant, the ’t9 quar—
terback, intercepted a forward
pass on his own 35-yard line
and ran the ball 65 yards over
an open field for a touch—
down. lfe failed to kick the
goal. hit for this misplay
the score would have been 3:0
in the Sophs‘ favor, which
would have better represented
the strength of both teams.
in the third quarter the Upper—
classmen, with a series of line
plunges, advanced to the
Sophrnnm‘es" 8 yard line, but
were held there in a pool of
mud for the fourth down. In
the final quarter Cassavant,
who played a brilliant game
throughout, kicked a beautiful
field goal from the 30—yard
line, which was the ﬁnal score
of the game. the contest ending
9:0 in favor of the Sophs. Be-
sides Cassavant, Nolcle did
good work for the second—year
turns and Bliss featured

men.

for the opposnion.
