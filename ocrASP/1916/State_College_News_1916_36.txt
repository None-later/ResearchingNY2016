After all a has been
printed in the columns of this
paper and after all that has
been spoken from the platform
in the auditorium in.regard to
the urgent need of thc coopera-
tion of all students with Man-
ager Pearsall in his campaign
to raise enough money to pay
for a coach for our basket-ball
live, that it should be neces-
sary for us to again take up
our pen in an attempt to stir
the delinquents to action, is a
task which to us is obnoxious
and which to the majority of
students must be humiliating.
But such is the case. After
three weeks of hard work only
about one-half of the amount
which is to come from the stu-
dents has been collected. in
other words, only about ﬁfty
per cent. of the students have
paid. To that half who have
met their obligation no thanks
are due. They have done their
duty, which is not more or less
than anyone ought. But what
about that half who are either
neglecting this tax or else
shamefully attempting to
dodge it? The most we can
say for them is that they ought
to be pitied. Either we must
pity them for the selfishness
and narrow-mindeduess they
display, or else for the igno-
rance which must be theirs.
And since we are of the
optimistic sort. wc pity them
for their ignorance, for igno—
rance we may contend with.
“ Ein steter Tropfen hohlt den
Stein,” the German says. Per—
haps we will at last make an
impression.
There is not a single great
college in the country which is

     

 

 

,not prominent in athletics. As

a general rule the fame of an
institution reaches as far as the
reports on its athletic contests.
The growth of a college de-
pends upon its fame, its repur

tatiou. if Colgate is now
known from coast to coast it is
because of a maroon Football
team that has ranked high for
years 'back. The same is true
of all other colleges the repre-
sentatives of which have done
{Jrcat thing's on the gridiron.
the diamond. or the basketball
court. You must grant. there-
fore. that the best means of ad-
vertisin‘g7 which a college can
have. is a good representation
in the athletic world.

if you (meaning the hanger-
hackl. if you were interested in
a biqlbusincss, it’s a ten to one
shot that you’d advertise.
\Vith the welfare of your con-
cern in your heart and with a
desire for gain to be satisﬁed
you’d engage an advertising,r
manager at a salary ranging
into the thousands. if you
wished to keep in the race this
would be indispensable. You
must grant this point also.

How about your college?
To those of you less favored
hv fortune, who have strug-
Lrlcd hard to gain the privilege
of being here. we put this
question knowingr full well that
cant answer will be that your
college means everything to
"on. To all others we want to
say that this ought to be their
answer also. but since it is not,
we have another question.
Have you not enough interest
in your Alma Mater. not
enough respect for your
faculty. not enough love for
your fellow students to con-
tribute the sum of tivcnty~ﬁve
cents toward the welfare of all?
Look deep into your hearts.
if there you can discover one
drop of red blood. if there you

can ﬁnd anything resembling

gratitude and loyaltv to your
Alma Mater. take oﬁ‘ that coat

 

of indifference you are wearing
and fall in line.

The ﬁrst syllable of each

out a half minute or so, the
sccond syllable to be Short and

'l‘hc spelling of State College

no means slow. Something
like chssclacr in the R. P. I.
yeil. State should be long
drawn out. College short and
snappy. Team. ctc., fast and
short.

How do you like these? if
you can beat them you are
welcome to try. '
