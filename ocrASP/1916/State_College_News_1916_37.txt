PROMISING OUTLOOK
FOR WINTER SPORTS.

Good Hockey Team Locked For.

Winter represents for some
of us a time of little illtCl‘tini. ’n
the world outdoors. We in-
stinctively turn to the ﬁre and
to inside work in the gym and
to our studies. Literally we
make of ourselves what they
call. in slang phraseology, “ in-
door sports.”

This year we are undertak-
ing to establish permanently
outdoor fall and winter sports.
which will liven up the in—
terest of the men as well as the
young women. We want to
see the tan of the summer re-
placed by the rosy checks of
winter.

The men of the college have
thus far responded with great
zeal and enthusiasm to foot—
ball. our fall sport. and now it
is hoped that the awakened
spirit will not he chilled to numb~
Hess by the approaching cold
weather, for we are planning on
having a hockey team here
which will hold its own on the
ice against all opponents. The
team will no longer have to go
to Raft: Lake. as it did last year.
for practice, but will have a
rink of its own, barely a bun-
dred feet from the college.

This skating rink is a great
surprise to most of you. but
you would he more surprised
to know the small amount of
money it will cost us. and how
reluctantly the Men’s A. A.
appropriates money for such a
worthy undertaking,

The city of Albany bought
the lulnbcr for the rink, which
will be r20xﬁo feet and 2 feet
high. The remaining expense
for grading the lot and for the
hockey cages, etc... will be
shared by the College and the
Albany High School.

Monday afternoon the sec-
tions of the rink were put to—
gether and staked in the
ground by the men of the
Freshman gym class. Soon we
will begin wetting the ground,
preparatory to ﬂooding the
rink. and then the prayer for
cold weather will begin.
Manager Burns is doing his
best with the limited resources
at hand, to arrange a ﬁne
hockey schedule.

The women of the college
will be at liberty to use the
rink for skating whenever the
hockey team is not practicmg

there.
