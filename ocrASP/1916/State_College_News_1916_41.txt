Mr. Wong first contrasted

Hence the life of the Chinese

llcr education along intel—
lectual lines was brief, but her
moral training was definite and
detailed. She was taught re-
spect for her elders. diligence

She had few pleasures. liven
her married life was not in her
own hands. lior not only was
the marriage arranged entirely
by her parents, but after the
wedding she lived with her hus~
band’s family and was under
the control of a inotlmr—iirlaw.
'l'hough this life in general was
not happy, the Chinese Woman
found some compensation in
the respect shown her during
her old age.

Mr. Wong spoke of the my
fluence of missionaries on
Chinese life. He appreciates
the good they have done, but
regret their attempts at politi—
cal reform which have hindered
the progress of Christianity,

lu conclusion.,Mr, \Vong
mentioned the prcscntalay ten-
dencies of life in China. In one
respect that country is more
progressive than An‘lcrica, for
in [OH Chinese women were
given suffrage by the govern—
ment.

Mr. Wong is in favor of no
man suffrage. though he is in—
clined to think American girls
a little “headstrong and talk-
ative,” and too much “under
the influence of Dame Fashion.”

AN INTERESTING BOOK

Mr. David M. Kinncar has
just completed an interesting
book, “High School Days and
the Old Philologians.” The pur~
pose of the hook is to aid in
securing funds for the erection
of memorials to the ﬁrst two
principals of the school, Profes-
sors Bradley and Robinson. The
hook gives much historical mat-
ter concerning the High School
and the Philologiain‘ and is well
illustrated with school views and
pictures of principals and gradu—
ates.

Pancoast Kidder on Life In-
surance.

Gave Interesting Lecture in Audi-
torium

 

()n Friday morning. Novem—
ber 24., in the auditorium, the
studentbody had the privilege
of hearing an expert talk on the
" Development and (irowth of
Life Insurance.” It was the
second lecture of the series on
life insurance which has lhceu
arranged for the benefit of the
students. The speaker on firi—
day was Mr. l’ancoast Kidder
ofthc l’i-nn Mutual Life Insur—
ance Company. Mr. Kidder
said that life insurance is the
scientific distribution of a loss
and that a life insurance coin-
pany is the highest expression
of an organization of the peo-
ple. for the people, and by the
people. Some of the facts with
which the speaker acquainted
the students are as follows:
The old style assessment insur—
ance is impracticable and ob-
solete. in this method of in—
surance a group would insure
the life of any one member,
which while comparatively
easy at first, is found hard to
keep up when time reduces the
group materially in numbers.
T.ife insurance is vbased on mor»
talitv. The individual life is
uncertain. but it has been dem—

 

of a group. p

insurance had it first feeble
beginning ‘- tlie‘ twelfth een—
fury in Venice. when the first
marine policies Were issued.
Later, in the fourteenth cen-
tury sortie policies are found in
flelgium. llnt these are, how-
ever, transactituis between in—
dividuals only. England is the
true birthplace of insurance, for
it was there in Lloyds that the
present systems were mainly
developed. Lloyds was then a
coffee house (artmnd I350).
Owners of v asels and other in-
lcrcsted par es met there and
took to thefting on the arrival
or non—arrival of this or that
cargo, and laid thus the be-
ginning of insurance in general,
and life insurance in particular.
lior graduallly the insurance
system was taken away from
chance and based on such laws
or taibles as could he estab-
lished. In 1664, ~lohn (.irant
wrote the first life insurance
laws, but his deductions were
imperfect. In 1693 lid flaley
studied the records of Ilrcslau.
Silesia. and made up tables on
the average length of life. This
table was incomplete and
elementary, Seventeen hun-
dred lifty~fi re brought the first
life insurance governing laws
in England. A man named
l’ricc was the first to develop
the fact that life insurance
tables must [be :based on ex-
perience.

In [842 l’cli founded the first
American life insurance Culll~
pany in New York City. (ircat
re. rictions were put upon the
insured person as to traveling,
living, manner of employment,
etc. in 1850 ii. Wright estab'
lished the first State super—
vision of life insurance in
.\lassachusctts. This has since
spread over the whole Union.
in recent years life insurance
business has grown enorm—
otisly.

.\t the present time over 43,-
ooo,ooo policies are in force.
Life insurance has reached a
point where its stability and
permanence can no longer be
doubted. lo the last twenty-
five years there has not been
one failure among life insur»
ance companies. When this
record is compared with that of
our banks, which are greatly
trusted, the result is obvious.
In closing, Mr. Kidder pointed
out that life insurance to~day
means a safeguard of family,

 

 

 

business, and old age. fits

social and economic value rests
in its fortification of the State,
in that it eliminates worry,
thereby take: a burden from
the shoulders of society and in
that manner increases efﬁci—
ency.

 

 

Over forty people were in-
itiated into the Il’rcnnethean
Literary Society last 'l'hursday
evening. Although it was a
rainy night, a good number of
the members were out to wit-
ness the fun. The next literary
meeting will be held November
7th, place and program to be
announced later,
