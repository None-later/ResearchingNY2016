Big Time Thnniulvln' Day
Conllnued from Page I
but it also ﬁts in very nicely
with the campaign now being
made for concerted cheering in
the college.

If the weather is at all
pleasant, a large crowd .should
be preSent, for 'both of the
underclasses have signiﬁed
their intention of being out in
a body to root for their team.
The rivalry between the
classes has shown itself to be
quite strong, and as this is the
first opportunity [or either
class to gain a decisive victory,
both ’I9 and ’20 will be watch-
ing for the result with great
anxiety.

As to the probable outcome
of the games. there are strong
arguments pro and con on
either side and any prophesy
would. be vbut guesswork.
Concerning lboth the tug-oi—
war and the race, nothing is
known. as ’l‘hursday will he the
first time anything has been
held along either line. The
ioothall game, which will be,
of Course, the main feature, is
sure to the an exciting one.
Iloth classes have played this
lall and in their games they
have showed up about even.
lioth teams have strong back
fields and many sI'iectacular
runs ought to result. in lIliss
and (lassavant each team has a
man who is quite adept at lor~
ward passing, and conse-
quently there will be plenty of
open play. An open game al—
ways is interesting“ and the re—
sult is usually in doubt until
the ﬁnal whistle. lirom all ap—
ocal'ances, both classes are
very overtly matched, and in all
proba'bility victory will be
brought to either class by some
unheralded hero. Here is a
chance for you, Soph and
li‘rosh gridiron warriors, For
one of you to have your name
go down in State College his—
tury as “The Man of the
Hour."

lithe liicld Day Thursday is
a success. it is the intention of
the Hopli~l"I'osli Activities
Committee to make the “rub«
'ber” Ibasketball game also a
gala event. Each class has
won a game and the deciding
one will be played sometime
before Christmas. The com-
mittee is planning on staging
this game, with some other
contests between the classes.
some evening after 'I‘hanksgiw
int,r and there‘l‘rv give the loser
of to-morrnw’s events a chance
to regain some lost laurels.

Results of Games.

Last .A/londay, November 20,
the Seniors forfeited their game
to the Sophomores. In a prac-
tice game the Sophs beat a
combination team by the score
oi 3: :23; the ofﬁcial score for
the league game being 2:0.

Last \‘\"'ednesday the Fresh-
men defeated the Seniors 29:17.
This was the first time that the
Seniors have had a full team on
the ﬂoor and judging by the
slimving‘ they made. it is saie
to say that they would have
been serious contenders for the
championship had they been
together all season. The
Seiiioi‘-l"i‘osli game was intcr~
estingr througlumt. The Sea—
iors. not havingr played to-
gether before this season, put
up a good game individually,
but they could not surpass the
ﬁne pass—work which Captain
Springman insists upon having
on the brush live. The hard
playing of Walker for the
Seniors and a shot from beyond
the middle of the ﬂoor by
I‘lager must be mentioned. as
well as the quick work of Col-
ton. who not only scored seven
baskets, but also titted in well
in the ﬂoor work
