STATE COLLEGE vs R. P.
FRIDAY, DECEMBER 8.

Purple and Gold Five in Shape.

 

 

 

Friday evening, l.)eceniber
8th, the State ‘College llasket—
ball live will open its season by
playing R. l”. l. in illi'oy. For
the ﬁrst time in the history of
the college, an expert coach has
been engang to tliring the team
into shape and it is said that
Coach Wachter’s efforts have
resulted in a machine which it
will be hard to defeat this year.
The IlF’urple and Gold has long
had the desire to heat R. P. l.
and this year this ambition may
be realizedf The exact line«iip
has not been decided upon as
yet. but the following men will
probably form the squad that
will be taken to Troy: Cap—
tain Jones. ’18, Fitzgerald ’17,
tioewey ’18, Fitzgerald ’19.Mil—
ler ’19, Peckham ’20, ifoliaus
’17. Colton ’20, S-pringman ’20,
and Cohen ’18.

A record crowd is expected to
accompain the team to Troy.
All should try to go on the same
train as the Varsity. Watch
the bulletin board for an-
nouncement-s. Once over there
all S. C. rooters should sit in a
bunch and. as largely as pos-
sible. all men together. Every—
one should help to make the
season’s opening an auspicious
one.

 

EXHIBIT IN THE ART DE-
~ PARTMENT.

The exhibit from some of the
high schools in New York City
shown in Miss Perinc’s room,
should be visited by all stu—
dents interested in art. A wide
variety of work is represented.
fl'here are sketches from ani—
mal life and still-life. poster
and advertising designs, nia—
chincry parts and costume
models. Some of the most iii-
teresting‘ drawings are those
made of objects seen under the
microscope. .th is quite evi-
dent that patience and perse-
yorance as well as talent were
requisite in the work. All stu—
dents of the college are invited
to inspect this exhibit before it
is returned.

 

 

Q‘So'pll's Trim Fmsli in lnterclass 

 

. 'l‘he Sophomores proved
their superiority over the
Freshmen on the gridiron, and
in track and field sports when
on 'l‘hanksgiving Day morning
they took their rivals into camp,
defeating them in every con-
test scheduled. The ﬁrst event.
the tug-ol-war, was hard
fought and only after about a
ininute and a half of the kecnest
sort 'of "ompetition (lid the
l‘d‘tlh‘ll yield to the superior
\vveight. The relay race was a
walk-away for the Sophs. Their
runners got away good and

HASTINGS SPEAKS
OF PRESS CLUB.

Dr. Hastings addressed the
st’udenti‘body ’Friday morning
during its regular weekly as~
senilin in the auditorium.
l'lis topic was the Press Club.
:l)r. l'fastings said that in
State lCollege one is impressed
with certain facts, among
which is the youth of the col—
lege; State ICollege has no tra—
ditions; its roots do not go
,back into the eighteenth cen—
tury; there is no picture gal—
lery of a famous alumnae. It
is a new place with no tradi—
tions. The institution has but
[recently been changed from a
Normal School into a college.
'We are therefore in a transi-
tional stage and the college,
therefore, especially deserves
the loyalty of faculty and stu—
dents at this time. A college is

DR.

an idea and an idea associated.

with the college is the idea of
self-expression. Self-expres-

 

sion can be given in college
magazines and papers. The
new Press Club, Dr. lrifastings
said, has three purposes; ﬁrst,
to give the students who write
for the “'Pedagogue,” the
,“Echo,” and the “News” a
convenient meeting place. In
the second place, it affords a
chance to all those who are
interested in that self—expres-
iuon which evidences itself in
the written word, and thirdly,
it will send out news about the
college to various papers in
the State.

_ The club has been organized
with Stanley Heason ’18 as
fli’resident and with the editors
of the three college publica—
tions as an executive com-
inittce. Dr. “Hastings called at
’liellllOll to the fact that there

'are difﬁculties to be overcome.

’fn this transitional stage of
our college it is hard. for one
iii-hing, to ﬁnd a proper meeting
jplaceand time. ._ .

 

were never in danger of being
passed. The banner event was
the football game and hardly
ever has a better gridiron battle
been staged. For two quarters
the Fresh crowded back the ’19
men and time and again were
kept: from scoring only by the
utmost efforts of Captain Cas—
sa 'ant andhis team. After half
time. however, they seemed to
have spent their force and the
tide gradually swept the other
way. A The Soplis put the game
on ice in the third quarter when
Cassavant shot a beautiful for-
ward pass into Fitzgerald’s
arms and the latter ran a‘bout
thirty-ﬁve yards for a touch—
down. Cassavant kicked the
goal. Score 7:0. In the last
quarter the ‘Sophs, With re-
peated end runs, drove the
Fresh .down the ﬁeld and,
crowded for time, Cassavant
kicked a ﬁeld goal from the
twenty-five-yard line ’that
looked good for ﬁfty. [‘his
brought the score to its ﬁnal
standing, 10:0. iCassavant
easily was the star of the game.
It was a pleasure to watch his
clean. coollheaded, yet forceful
playing. in fact, the whole
Soph backfield, with Logan,
Miller, and Fitzgerald, scented
to be in the best of shape. In
spite of their defeat, the Fresh~
men did great work. 'lhey
had a heavier team against
them, but in spite of. these odds
at all times were in the fray,
tenaciously holding every inch
of ground. On their side Bliss,
Goldenkoff, and H. Goewey
featured. The Fresh took
their defeat graciously and

proved themselves good

‘sportsmen.

; The threatening weather
Neverthe-

kept many away.
less about 200 watched the
games, and the cheering was a
feature on the day’s program.
fl‘lius State College ﬁrst foot-
ball season was closed in a
Tvery auspicious manner. May
the next open as well.
