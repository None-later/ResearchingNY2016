Mr. Champlin, of the New
York State Library, in a re-
cent address in the auditor-
ium, made the rather startling
statement that some twenty—
ﬁve books have been taken
from the library without per—
mission, presumably by Stll'
dents of this college, and have
not been returned. These vol—
umes were placed at the easy
disopsal of students in certain
courses given here, and as
they were not missed until the
shelves had been ch.-cked up
shortly after college closed, it
is quite reasonable to suppose
they were carried ..way by
persons over-anxious in their
desire to succeed in last June’s
ﬁnal examinations.

With the approach Of the
mid-year’s examinations it may
be 'well to again take up the
topic.

It would be both useless
and unnecessary to discuss the
indifference of the guilty ones
to a certain precept of the
decalog, but the fact that such
an act is most unfair to a great
number of students, who,
through the selﬁshness of a
few, are denied a share in the
beneﬁts that the latter have
“bogged,” will bear some con-
sideration.

Is your own success (a
trivial success, too, when one
considers the principle for-
feited in obtaining it in such a
manner) the biggest thing you
have gotten out of your years
of study? Is that 'all your
early teachers did for you? Is
that all the high school did for
you? Is that all this college is
doing for you? Haven’t you
yet learned to think‘oocasion-

ally of the needs of others?
If not, you have missed one of
the greatest aims of education
and your time has been badly
misapplied. Moreover, unless
you are capable of putting
aside this selﬁsh tendency. you
are decidedly in the wrong
pew. You can't be a success—
ful teacher and lack moral
equipment. A thousand times
more than what he knows, a
teacher is what he is. If you
really mean to persist in teach-
ing for a livelihood, get started
right now, and forever after—
ward play the game fair.

Editor State College News:

The basketball season is ap-
proaching and our ﬁrst game is
out of town, at Troy. We
want to and we expect to win
this game. The support of the
students is needed and good
support and good cheering will
undoubtedly spur our men on
to greater effort. SO let’s have
a large crowd to go with the
team to Troy. And when we
get there let’s keep together. I
would suggest that the man-
ager of basketball would ar—
range to have a section of the
R. P. I. gym reserved for State
College students. Last year at
the Union game there were a
few State ’College supporters
present. Ibut those were scat—
tered throughout the Union
gym and con. equcntly thc
cheering was lacking.

Now let’s keep together. It’s
the only way in which we can
do any good cheering and
cheering helps to win games.

Keep together and cheer!
'chccrl cheer!

Now heed my warning word to you

KISMET.
(Sic parkae volnerc l)

Once I said to timid Tyson:

” Nolde is coming apacel

And he’ll make a wreck

Of your swanlikc neck

And ruin your ﬂorid face.

He’s armed with a large Lim~
‘berger,

A krowbar is in his hand,

And he says he’ll camp

On your frame and tramp

Your dignity in the sand l "

And. the sad-eyed, tearful
Tyson

Siglted and said: “Merry me,

I didn’t know Nolde was angry,

Dear, what kan the matter be?

Since he’s peeved let him come
and slay me

And here by my door 1’“
wait -—.”

(For what is written is written,

And nothing kan alter fate.)

Once I said to tth hard-hearted

Hohaus,

“Crecn’blatt is seeking your

This morning he purchased a

in heaven and sea and ground,

That ‘ihc’ll ﬁnd out what is in-

That makes

GOOD IDEA.
(" The poor have ye always
with you”)

Lest the “ News ” ‘be thought
(lilatol'y in manifesting the
modern spirit of philanthropy,
this opportunity is being taken

 

  

to assure the publik that “ Rag-
time” ‘Smiuh is a most worthy
objekt of charity and urges all
kindhearted individuals to sub-
skribe liberally to the relief
fund, which the “Echo” has
charge‘ of. A fellow feeling
makes us guess that the
“ Echo’s ” own experience in
existing without subskriptions
probably akkounts for the kind
sugestiou.

Girls’ Basketball Games to Start
This Week.

 

At a recent G. A. A. meet-
ing, the association voted to
appropriate five dollars to be
used by the Men’s A. A.
hockey committee toward cx—
penses for the new rink.

The managers of the girls’
basketball squads have sched-
uled three of the interclass
games to he played off before
Christmas \v'acatiou. The
series will start December 7,
when the Sophs will play the
Seniors. December 14, the
Juniors will play the Seniors,
and l.)ccemlber 19, the Sop‘hs
will play the juniors. All of
these games will be played
during the noon hour. The
rest of the games will not be
played until after mid—year’s,
for by that time the Freshman
squad will be in line shape, and
exams will not have suffered
from athletics, and vice—versa.

Coach Austin has held three
Freshmen practices. From the
appearance of their material
the .l’reslunen are justiﬁed in
bidding the upperclass teams
to ” Beware!” But, please, 0
Frosh, don’t be carried away
with the idea that you don’t
need practice!

FROSH-SOPH DANCE.

 

The Freshmen entertained
the Sophomores at an informal
dance in the college gymna-
sium, Friday evening, to pay
for their defeat Thanksgiving
morning. The paramount
feature of the eveningr was the
songs and cheers given ‘by the
rival classes. 1920 proved that
they were “ good sports” :by
taking their defeat good na—
turcdly and treating their rival
guests royally. The chaper-

ones included IMiss Pierce,
Prof. and Mrs. rRisley and
Prof. and Mrs. Thompson.

Music was furnished by the
college orchestra. Everyone
was pleased with the affair.
and it is hoped that it may
establish a precedent for com-
ing years.
