- INDUSTRIAL ORGANIZA-

TION GROWING
RAPIDLY.

Electimi of ofﬁcers took place
at a meeting of the industrial
Organization a week ago. At
this meeting the executive
committee submitted a new
constitution to the members of
the organization. The consti«
tution was read, amended and
adopted. The following ofﬁ—
cers were elected:

President, Leslie ll. Van Der
Walker ’18; Vice—President,
Stanley lt‘itzgerald ’17; Secre-
tary and ilfrcasurer, Edward
Springmann ’20; Reporter,
Henry L. Green‘blatt ’18.

The object of this organiza-
tion is to promote the welfare
of the students interested in
industrial education. For pro~
moting such interest, the mem'
bers decided upon one of the
best means, which is to bring
before them some of the most
prominent men who are devot-
ing their lives to this compara-
tively new and fast progressing
branch of education.

it is perhaps interesting to
those who have apparently lit-
tle knowledge of the industrial
work, that the demand for men
to teach these various indus—
trial subject is greater 'hy far
than the present supply.

in order to,establish closer
relationship among industrial
students of State College. it
has been decided to add several
social functions to the program
of the new organizatirm. .lt is
hoped, however, that this will
prove more successful than
before.

To the Students of State Col-
lege:

f wish to take this means to
express to you my appreciation
for your support at our Cheer
Practice.

It really was gratifying to
see at least two hundred 5tu~
dents gathered in the gym
ready to do their share of mak~
ing athletics a success. it is
true that the Cheer Practice
has not assumed a deﬁnite
form or method of procedure
as yet, but that will come.

Now that we have made a
good start, let us keep it up.
Do not lag. The spirit of a
true student is always at fever
heat when he can go anything
for his College. Let us all he
true students!

Respond as heartily in the
future to all calls for Cheer
Practice. \Vatch the bulletin
boards, also the weekly calen—
dar in the “ News."

Remember College life is not
all “take,” 'but requires a little
“give.” So give your voice for
cheering.

of their appreciation of his rare
athletic skill.

sometime in the schedule in
which those interested in Classic

Social Dancing is given. if a
large enough class can be
formed without conflicting
with su'hjects in the. curri—
culum, the classes will go on as
soon as organized. Watch the

ments concerning these dances
and dance classes at the State
