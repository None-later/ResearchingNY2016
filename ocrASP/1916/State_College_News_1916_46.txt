STATE COLLEGE NEWS, DECEMBER 6,‘ 1916

IN'l ERCLASS BASKET-
BALL LEAGUE.

Dispute Settled.

Standing of the teams:
W

Team . L.

Sophomores . . .. 3 I 750
Freshmen . .  4 2 666
'J'uniors . . . . . . . .. 3 2 600
Seniors. . . 5 000

 o

The above is the correct
standing up to and including
Friday, December Ist. The
various disputes were an—
nounced as settled in the fol-
lowing manner: The protest
of the Freshmen, who wanted
the. lirst game of the season
thrown out, was not allowed.
Although their claim that the
game really was played before
the seam! ofﬁcially opened is
recognized, yet the fact that
the game was regularly played
and fairly won, and was under—
stood. by both sides to be a

league game, makes its with-

drawal inadvisable.

The contention of the Juniors
that the game soheduled be~
tween them and the Sopho-
mores on the day before elec—
tion should have been post-
poned was accepted. because
unavoidable conditions existed
on the day the game was to
have been played which were
not taken into consideration
when the game was scheduled.
This game between the Juniors
and Sophs will have to be
played later.

RESULTS OF GAMES.

Last Monday, November 2",
the Sophs beat the Juniors in
a poorly played game 29:17.
The Juniors simply could not
get started and put up the
worst exhibition so far seen
this season.

Last \Vedncsday, November
20, the Frosh defeated the
Juniors 29:16. The score at
half time was 20:3 in the
lirosh’s favor, but the Juniors
came back strong and out-
played their opoueuts in the
last half.

H. E. DEPARTMENT.

York City, ol’ﬁcc Secretary of
