TAX LECTURE BY
JOHN Z. WHITE

John Z. White, of Chicago.
an authority on municipal and
federal taxation. was the first
speaker at the series of civic
lectures which opened last
\\'ednesday night in the audi-
torium of the college. The

of the college, in co-opcration
with the Civil League. The
topic of Mr. White's lecture
was “ The Single Tax."

The speaker was introduced
by President A. R. Bruhachcr.

"' Land and human industry
arc the only two successful tax-
able things in this country.”
declared Mr. White, “ and un-
til taxaticu is confined to these
alone, the progress of the mu-
nicipality or the country at
large will be handicapped."

'l‘o further illustrate this
point Mr. White cited in-
stances in the city of Chicago
where. he said, 69 per cent. of
the building lots are now va-
cant because of the high im-
provement tax rate.

“To tax public improve-
ments in a community is to
lower the value of the land, and
with this comes a disastrous
blow to the town or city,” he
said.

Municipal Taxation.

the season. which was played

in 'l‘roy. The score of the con-
test was 45 22!.

About three hundred stir

panied the State College team
to 'l‘roy and loyally stood by
the live during all stages of the
game. The game started fast.
and a whirlwind pace was kept
up for about liftccn minutes.
During this time the Slate (‘ol-
legc ll\‘c was li. l'. l.'s equal in
every department of the game.
'l'hcir passing was accurate,
their Iloorwurk fast. and their
judgment good. In the first
few minutes lx’ensselacr shot
ahead to a four point lead. but
State t‘ollegc immediately tied
the score. Again and again the
engineers would forge ahead,
hut the wearers of the Purple
and (iohl would even tip the
count. The score stood lltl I.
The large bleachers on both
sides of the gym seemed to he

cheer came from the followers
of both teams. liach side felt
sure of victory; the crisis of the
ganu- had come; the team now
getting the break would win.
The realization of this fact
brought forth renewed yells.
The men on the floor were
doing their utmost; the State
('ollcge livc was playing be-
yond expectations. Hope he-
gau to rise in the heart of every
supporter of the Purple and
Hold. 'l'hcn the break came,
and it favored l\’. i’. i. Peck-

trouble with his side. Captain

game. would mean the break.
He had hoped his pivotman
would recover. but when he
saw his team slowed up 'by the
center's inability to keep up the
pnt‘t', he called for time out.

game State College by no
means gave up. but fought the
'l‘rojans to the, finish. making
them work for every point
won. l'lut they simply could
not hit their stride again. Only
when li‘. li‘itzgcrald was sub-
stittlted for fioewey at forward
and Cocwey went in at center
in l’cckham’s place did their
playing again resemble that of
the first fifteen minutes.

The score at half time was
2f713 in favor of R. P. I., and
the true final score should have
been in that proportion or
better. S. Fitzgerald had a
bad day at fouls‘hooting, mak-
ing good only in one out of
eleven trials. A better record
in this department would have
made tbc score look better.
For R. P. l. Ewing starred
with eleven baskets. This,
however, was made possible
only by the good floor work of
\\"oolscy. who was hardly ever
covered aftcr the ﬁrst part of
the game. The VVoolsey—Par-
rott—lhving combination com-
ing down the floor was too
much for the State College dc«
fence. although both Jones and
Miller did all in their power to
stop them. It was simply a
case of two against threc with
the natural result. Miller, a
new man with the Purple and
Cold, played a brilliant game.

from any of the other men, it
