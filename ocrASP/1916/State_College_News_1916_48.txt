THE JOSEPH HENRY

SOCIETY.

.-\t the regular meeting held
Nov. 22 (iuy V. Bruce gave an
interesting discussion on “The
Physics of the Earthquake,” a
brief synopsis of which is given
here. The ancients believed
that the earthquake was the
visitation of an angry deity.
Even amongr tihe civilized pcoA
ples of a comparatively modern
age. such absurd and amusing’

ideas were held. About the
middle of the 19th century
japan started the first real

scientiﬁc investigation to find
the true cause of the earth-
quake. in brief. the scientists
of to—day say that an earth-
quake always means a yielding
to stress, \which is the result of
an unstable condition in gravi~
tational equilibrium. This un-
stable equilibrium is due to the
cooling and contraction of the
earth’s interior, which causes
the outer crust to buldge out
and ﬁnally fracture, and return
to its former state of equilib—
rium with a grant shock. The
“dislocation earthquake” is
caused by the earth “caving
in." and this sometimes leaves
a visible crack or fault. The
area embracing the ac‘ual dis«
placement is comparatively
small in any earthquake, while
the shock may be sensibly felt
over an entire continent.
What becomes of the enor-
mous amount of cncrg‘y‘of the
earthquake? Omitting details,
the energy is reflected within
the crust and transmitted back
and forth through the entire
mass of the earth in form of
faint tremors, that may con-
tinue for hours, and ﬁnally
fritter away in heat.

CHEMISTRY CLUB.

 

Mr. 'l‘aylor. of the Lansing-
burg lligh School, and form~
crly chcmisl with the Diamond
Match Company in their fac-
tory in Oswego, N. Y.. ad-
dressed the Chemistry Club on
Friday. Dec. 3. Mr. Taylor
showed the development of the
match, beginning with the old
brimstone match, which was
made by dipping splints of
wood in sulphur and igniting
this with the spark from flint
and steel. Following this came
the “chemical " match, which
was made of an oxidizing
agent. sulphur and sugar. and
was ignited by dipping in
sulphuric acid.

Later there was the “fric-
tion ” match. and this was the
one that was used universally
until the early part of the twcn-
iicth century. The modern
“safety friction ” match is the
friction type that is now used,
while the “safety” match. a
Swedish invention, has been in
use for some ﬁfty years.

Mr. Taylor told about some
of the methods that are used
in analyzing the materials and
ﬁnished products. At the close
of the meeting he was elected
to honorary membership.

The following members were
elected to serve as ofﬁcers of
the Club: President. Miss
Stewart; Vice-President. Miss
Payne; Secretary, 'Miss Mur—
taugh: Treasurer. iMr. Wink-
ler; Librarian. Miss Johns;
Counselor. Mr. Kennedy.

The Club is still growing
ranidly. the following students
being elected to membership:
Tessie Lane. Edna Woodward.
Ruth Patterson. Harold Lob-
dell, Walter Fraser, Nelson
Force, Verna McCann and
Edith Sullivan.

NEW FEATURE IN IN-
DUSTRIAL DEPART-
MENT. -

Last year a new course in

plumbing and electric wiring

was added to the industrial
work. The students of that
class have successfully carried
out their plans to the best of
their ability within the class
room. it has been a perfect
success as far as general prac-
tice is concerned, but this year
the industrial Department has
undertaken a new project
which has' many advantages
over the former work. This
project has brought to the stu-
dean a more practical under-
standing of the work, as they
are reinstalling the plumbing
and electric wirng necessary
for the completion of the house
selected by the Home lico-
nomics Department of the Col-
lege.
The students taking this
course are very fortunate in
procuring such practical means
for putting their theoretical
training to a test, and are
showing their appreciation by
the earnestness evidenced in
carrying out instructions.

The practice house is di-
rectly opposite the College at
429 Washington avenue. The
girls of the Home Economics
Department have already
started to furnish it. \Vith the
combined efforts of both De—
partments. it is expected that
in the near future the facilities
for putting all theoretical train-
ing into practice will be greatly
improved.

CHARLES ZEILMAN ’19

HOLDS WEBER, R. P.
I. MAN. TO DRAW.

 

Chas. Zeilman ’19. State Col-
lege’s strong man. went to
Troy last Friday evening and
there. between the halves of
the R. P. T.‘Stﬂf(‘. College game,
gave a wrestling exhibition
with R. P. f.’s crack wrestler.
Although VVober seemed to
have a little the better of it, yet
Zeilman was never in danger.
The exhibition was clean and
interesting. It is to be hoped
that Zeilman and some of the
other State College wrestlers
will have other chances to
show what they can do.

INDUSTRIAL ORGANIZA«
TION GIVES RECEP-
TI

 

Saturday evening the recently
formed Industrial Organiza—
tion entertained the Senior
Home Economic girls at a
party given in the industrial
building. The affair was an
all—around good time, and
everybody present enjoyed it
immensely. The main object
of the affair was to make every—
body acquainted, and in order
to achieve this purpose prizes
were offered to those who stic—
cceded in making the largest
number of acquaintances. Miss
Palmer succeeded in carrying
off the premier honors, while
Miss l-Talleron received the sec—
ond prize. A consolation prize
was given to the person in the
room known to have met the
least number of new people.
Mr. Goff modestly accepted the
token. Among the faculty
members present were Prof.
and Mrs. Smith, Prof. and Mrs.
Douglas and Prof. Burke.

The Junior Prom. Commit—
tee is working on its plans f0r
