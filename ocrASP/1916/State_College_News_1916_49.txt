can be said that he was the best
man on the team. Illness pre-
vented Coach Wachter from
being at the game and un-
doubtedly that was one reason
for the defeat. Again, the men
may have been overtrained
just a little, so that the very
large court in Troy was too
much for them.

In spite of the defeat the
team is lookingr forward to the
Union game on Saturday with
the greatest of conﬁdence.
The ice is now broken. Coach
\\'achtcr will go with them to
Schenectady, and the Union
court is much more to their
liking. Besides it is the opin-
ion of many, that the Union
team this year is not quite as
good as R. P. L’s. Also, 1“.
'fiitzg‘erald will probably have
recovered from his injuries by
then.

The large crovd of State
('ollcge folks who went to
Troy was encouraging. About
300 were over there. if this
same interest prevails for the
home games, the basketball
management will not have
much to complain about.

The Sophomores made their
lead in the Basket IIall League
more secure during: the past
week 'by winning. both games
in which they took part. They
are now leading the Fresh-
men, who are in second place,
by one game. The Juniors are
now in third place, two games

 

behind the leaders and one be—
‘hind the Freshmen. The
week’s playing showed a re—
markable reversal of form on
the part of the Senior team.
They now have a very fast and
hard working aggregation and
the other teams will have to
reckon with them. There have
been rumors to the effect that
the Seniors have been dropped
from the league, but since
they now have a good live to-
gether and are anxious to con-
tinue in the ﬁght they will in
all probability carry out their
part of the schedule,
RESULTS OF GAMES.

Last Monday the Sophs
played the Seniors. Both
teams were weakened. the
Seniors by the absence of
[lager and the Sophs by the
loss of Honey Miller. who.
since he is a varsity man, is
barred from class games. The
game was the best played in
the series this year. The score
was close at all times, causingr
intense excitement amongr the
spectators. ;\t halftime the
Sophia lead ttzto, then the
Seniors surged ahead, due to
some good floor work by
Walker and some ﬁne shots by
llohaus. ‘In the last few min—
utes of play \Cassavant, who
was the mainstay of the Sopho-
mores throughout, made two
g‘l'eat shots from the middle of
the floor, thus saving the game
for his team. ' he final score
was 20:I5.

On \Vedncsday afternoon
the Sop‘hs beat the Juniors by a
score of I3 :6. The Juniors,
not having Cohen, who is on
the varsity squad. and without
anyone ready to substitute.
played the game with but four
men. The contest was not at
all uninteresting: The second
half, in which the Juniors out—
played the Sophs 6:2, was
especially fast and full of life.

New Engli-h Syllabus Adopted
t'nnltmu'd Jrom l'upn l
dent John ll. Finley was au<
thorixed to appoint a com»-
tuition to prepare a syllabus
for these grades, 1

President Finley, in cont
mcnling‘ upon the syllabus
adopted, said it would have de-
cidcd emphasis on oral liltiglish
in that it will aim toward the
better and more accurate use of
the language in eteryday life.
He said:

"The most impcn‘tt'tnt fea~
lure of the new English sylla—
bus is the emphasis that is
placed on oral English, which
is for the first time included in
the general linolish syllabus.
This consummation is the most
notable constructive action re-
latiucr to the teaching of line'—
lish that has been taken in the
United States. it is directed
primarily not toward public
speech, but toward the better
and more accurate use of Ting»
lish in everyday life, recogniz-
ing: the fact that in life. oral (‘x-
pi . ion is'nsed much more ex-
tensively than written expres~
sion and should therefore be
given much attention,”

The propos .1 revised syllabi
in Antodern languages and in
Latin were referred to Dr.
li'inlcy with authru‘ity to res
formulate and present to the
Hoard of Regents for adoption.
The chief characterization of
these syllahi is the vocabulary.
which every student will be ex-
pected to know at the end of
the second year. Tn the Latin
lists there are I,ooo words and
in the German 2.500. The
French and Spanish lists have
not been submitted, but it is
expected they will include
about 2,500 words each.

A list of 5,000 words for use
in the elementary schools was
presented and a passingT mark
of eighty-live per cent. will be
required in spelling.

The requirements for the
college entrance diploma in
arts were moderated by adding
second year Greek to the
electives as a third foreign
language.

ing to the lecturer, -“ all in-
comes are the result of land
and toil.

“We have passed the point'
where taxation of improve-
ments will be an incentive to
build, and in order to protect
the interests of the municipali-
ties we should retreat to the
point of land taxation.”

The city of Victoria, Canada,
was one of the first to adopt
the municipal land taxation
method. doing away with the
improvement tax, and as a re-
sult the city is one of the most
progressive in the Northwest.

The improvement tax is driv-
inp' people away from the
farms and into the cities where
they are forced into the world
of industry to the expense of
the agricultural World. This.
accordingr to Mr. White, will
lower the standard of the
Country in both an economic
and military sense. for he de-
clarcd further “a country that
is first in commercial activity
is bound to be successful in its
military endeavors."
