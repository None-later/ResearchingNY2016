He Ronville spoke first of life in-
surance laws. lle said that the
laws of New York were intended
to avoid confusion. extrava-
gance and waste caused by loo
rapid growth of life insurance

ness of the companies is limited

for that year. Mr. De Rouville
held that the life insurance laws
of New York are better than
in any other State. The law ap-
plies to the crnnpauies when
transacting business in other
States just as much as it does
here. However. the speaker
complained that the tax on life
insurance is an injustice for. he
said. life insurance is a form of

camp last Saturday evening, Dc-
cember trill]. The game. was
played on the Union court and
ended in a 29:16 score. The
game was exceptionally fast
throughout. After a few Illin-
utes of play Union went into the
lead when Yovilz made good a
shot from the foul line. Im—
mediately alter Coewey made a
basket from the field bringing
State College into the lead. For
about live minutes the contest
was even, with the fastest; kind
of work on both sides. Then,

$1.50 PER YEAR

however, the State College men
began to abandon the close
guarding game which they em-
ployed in the beginning and as a
result, the Union men being free,
the Garnet team rolled up a big
score, There seemed to be a dc—
sire on the part of: some of the
State College men to make
baskets. it would hardly be just
to name any one of the offenders
nor would it be of advantage,
but the. fact remains that: in the
ﬁrst half there was altogether too
much individual playingr on the
State College team. Useless
dribbling was indulng in when
passes would have advanced the
hall much faster, and long, im-
possible shots were often tried
when men were free right near
the basket. Coach Waehter
recognized the faults of the team
and between the halves gave the
men a sound lecture. and good
advice in regard to the style of
play to be used in the second
half. As a result the men came
back strong and from half time
on were every hit the equal of
the Union live. The reversal of
form was remarkable. Soon
after the whistle Gocwey came
through with a basket and with
S. Fitzgerald making good from
the. foul line in his usual wonder—
ful manner and every man on the
team playing to the best of his
ability the Union team was out-
played throughout the ﬁnal
period. Captain Jones had the
right spirit in the men and he and
Miller were playing a ﬁne guard
game. F. Fitzgerald was faster
than ever. not only doing his
part in the offensive, but also
guarding his man closely when-
ever Union had the ball.
Coewey played much better in
this half also. He was fast on
the floor and played the much
heavier Galbraith well. S. Fitz—
gerald, in addition to makingt
e‘ood in eight out of eleven
trials from the foul line, played
a good all—around game on the
ﬂoor. The second half ended in
a 10:9 score in favor of State
College.

The Union men were very
favorahlv impressed by the fast
work of the Purple and Gold.
it is their opinion that the State
(i‘ollce‘e team is much better than
the ('larkson Tech. ﬁve which
was defeated by Union by a
score of 32:16. Clarkson, how—
