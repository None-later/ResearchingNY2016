On account of the Christmas
vacation the next issue of the
“ News ” will not appear until
Wednesday, January 10. Be-
ginning with that issue single
copies of the “ News ” will cost
seven cents. The advance in
price is absolutely necessary
since the cost of printing alone
amounts to ﬁve and a quarter
cents per COPY» so that a sale
price of ﬁve cents means a loss.

The, committee wishes to
thank all those who, in agree—
ment with their contract, have
paid the $1.50 for the year’s
subscription to the “News.”
It wishes to remind all those
who have not yet paid of the
fact that it also has obligations
to meet, and that, in order to
do, so, it must secure every
cent that has been promised.
The committee realizes the
handicap under which some of
the students are working and,
therefore, has been patient in
its dealings with the delin-
quents. However, it expects
and it demands that everybody
pay up the debt immediately
after the Christmas recess.
The committee takes this op—
portunity to wish for the
faculty and students a Merry
Xmas, a Happy New Year and
an enjoyable vacation.

other school in the whole United
States.

faculty and Dr. Henry Hun,

Albany Boys’ Academy, are re—
cciving congratulations on the
triumph of the academy and its

DR. DUGAN ADDRESSES
COLLEGE CLUB.

On Friday, December 15th,
Dr. Dugan, already well known
to many of us, addressed College
Club. His subject was: “ The
Place of Educated Men and
Women in Public Life.”

Dr. Dugan said that there is
to-day a great need for the edu—
cated person to project himself
into what is called the common
life. Public affairs are greatly
under the inﬂuence and guidance
of the uneducated, of people who
have not been trained to think.
This is due mainly to the ten-
dency of college graduates to
hold themselves aloof from 0th-
crs, and live. selﬁshly. alone.

A connnunity has a right to
look to the educated man as its

 

representative, for cooperation
and help in public affairs. The
advantages of learning are given
to be used unsclﬁshly, and pres-
ent; conditions need just the up-
lift: and reﬁnement that the cdu-

‘catcd man alone can give.

Dr. .Dugan concluded with a
plea to us as college students to
break down artiﬁcial barriers and
enter into public life with energy
and interest; not to hold our—
selves apart from the world, but
really live in it. The time is now
ripe. for working out our ideals;
for the world has grown broader
nowadays and will receive the
help we can give.

PRESS CLUB HOLDS IN-
TERESTING MEETING.

At a meeting of the State Col-
lege Press Club held last Mon—
day evening. Dr. Hastings spoke
on " Types of Newspaper
Articles.” Dr. Hastings said
that maximum information in
minimum amount of space is an
absolute requirement for news-
paper work. He pointed out:
that a newspaper should be so ar-
ranged as to arouse the curiosity
of the reader. and that: a good
headline is the most essential
and, in fact. the most valuable
part of a paper.

Stanley l-Teason, President of
the club, explained to various
new members and committees the
duties they are to perform. The
following; new members cn-
rolled:

Florence l‘lolgcrson, who will

H. E. VDEPT.

 

The practice house has been in
use since last week Monday. The
ﬁrst problem carried out was
the testing of meals planned by
the dictettcs class according to
the average food requirement of
each group. This was a valu-
able experience for all as it was
found that the standard was too
high and a readjustment is being
made.

Several groups have remained
over night at the house with
Miss Van Licw, the ﬁrst stu~
dents being Marguerite Stewart
and Ellen Van Clccf. Others
who have been there for the
night are Marion Payne and
Mildred Bentley. Margaret
Brown and Anna Holloran.

For the past week a group at
ﬁve Seniors have been preparing
and serving meals in the house.
doingr their own planning of
meals, marketing and work. An
accurate account of time and
money spent is being kept. Im-
provements are beingr made in
the arrangement of kitchen
equipment and utensils in order
to facilitate rapid work so that
meals may be prepared and
served with the least cxpcndi~
lure of time and energy as pos—
sible. The group working now
is Louise Goldberg, Margaret
Tlrown, Anna 'l’Tolloran, Anna
Harlow and Mina Davies, with
Miss Wilson as faculty member.

The Dietetic Class has made
plans for Christmas food boxes
for the Charities Organization
this year. The basis for this
work is the study of foods for
the greatest amount of food
value per unit cost of foods.
Some of the foods selected are
shoulder of pork. loin of mutton,
bccf heart, cabbage, carrots, po—
tatoes. beets, dried peas, peanuts,
dates, oatmeal and cornmeal.

GIRLS l

 

All the girls who have any
college spirit at all are expected
to attend the S, C. T.—St. Law-
rence game Wednesday evening
in the A. H. S. Gymnasium. The
varsity has been defeated in its
ﬁrst two games, but that is no
reason why our next game
shouldn’t result in a victory. A
little enthusiasm from the side—
lines goes a great way and if we
can help our team in that way
let's get out and show the follows
that we are behind them.

Y. W. C. A. MEETING.

 

The weekly meeting of the Y.
W. (T. A. will be held at the usual
hour in the auditorium Wednes-
day. This is the Christmas meet-
innr and will be devoted to sing—
ing: Let all the members try
to be present as this is the
last time together before sepa—
rating for the holidays.
