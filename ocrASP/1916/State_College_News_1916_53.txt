SENIORS.

Seniors Again Fail to Score.

 

'l‘hursday noon the champion
girls’ team of last year again suf—
fered defeat. This time at the
hands of the juniors. The game
was rather one—sided and very
rough. Nevertheless the ’18
team are just a triﬂe proud of
their victory over their old
rivals. The good work of the
centers {or the ’18 team kept the
ball in their end of the court
about two—thirds of the time. D.

the 12 points for the Juniors, and
R. Moseley gained all of the
Senior points on fouls. The

BASKETBALL DANCE.

 

The second Invitation Dance
held for the‘beneﬁt of the basket-
ball treasury, last Friday even~
lug, was a very pleasant and en-
joyable affair. About forty
couples were present. Among
the patrons and patronesses were
Dr. and Mrs. Hastingr and Pro—
fessor and Mrs. Randall. The
music was furnished by Greg-
Way’s orchestra.

 

Mr. DeRouville Speak! On Inaunnce

of the investigation in 1905 and
1906 there is to-day no business
so thoroughly safeguarded as
that of life insurance.

The total alnount of life insur-
ance carried to~day in the United
States alone equals $32,580,-
064,000. T’ully tln‘ee-quarters of
this amount is held by the legal
reserve companies, the speaker
said, and the balance by fraternal
and cooperative companies.
This indicates the enormous
growth of the life insurance
business. .In 1860, according to
Mr. De Rouville, 49,000 policies
were in force, representing
$t4 r .ooo,ooo. ’l‘o-day 27,000,000
policies are in force, represent-
int,r the amount stated above.
This is a greater amount for the
United States alone, than is rep-
resented by all the life insurance
companies of the rest of the
world combined.

The life insurance ﬁeld forms
a good opportunity for invest—
ment. it is made secure by
law, and in a great many num-
ber of years there has been no
loss. At the present time
about $5,500.000 are invested
in this business. 'In this
connection Mr. De Rouvillc
spoke very highly of the in—
tegrity of life insurance collec-
tors. saying that in the collection
of about $ooo,poo,ooo there had
been hardly any loss. He (‘Oll'l-
pared this record favorably with
that of bank employees. The vo-
cational opportunities of life in-
surance are greater than those
of any other line of business.
In the insurance business per—
soual achievements count for
much, and there is liberal com—
pensation to individuals for all
work done. The success of a
man is limited only by his own
limitations. A recent: investiga-
tion among the members of
Yale’s 1906 class, made four or
ﬁve years after graduation,
showed that among them the in«
surance men received the highest
compensation.

in closing Mr. De Rouville
said, that life insurance is a
social service which has grown
to such an extent that to-day the
combined net earnings of all the
railroads in the country could not
pay the total premium. It is a
growing business, for in a period
durianr which the population of
the country has only doubled, the
volume of business done by life
insurance companies has in—
creased ten~fold.
