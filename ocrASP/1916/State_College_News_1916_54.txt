STATE COLLEGE NEWS, DECEMBER 20. 1916

HOCKEY OUTLOOK
PROMISING.

Rink in Shape—Big Squad Out.

Since the weather has become
more favorable hockey is taking
up more interest as one of the
sports of the college. It is sur-

prising to see with how much

earnestness the men are taking
up the game. Manager Burns
is trying to get several nearby
teams to come here to play, but
he is handicapped by the late
season and by the lack of funds.
The rink is now completed and
ready for use. it stands as an
exaniple of what can be accom—
plished when the necessary push
is behind the undertaking. In
this case mneh credit must be
given to ( ant ’19 who has
u-orketl hard to make hockey in
State College a reality. It is to
he hoped that his etTorts will sue-
eet-(l, 'l‘hc city authorities made
the rink a possibility by supply-
inp' the lumber and loaning to the
men 300 feet of ﬁre hose by
means of which the rink is
ﬂooded.

.\ game had been scheduled
with lx’. l‘. I. for lust Saturday,
but was cancelled by the engi-
neers, probably on aveount oi
the lack of a rink. The game
will be played later, however.
Everythingr points towards a
good team. :\ big squad has
been out practicing for over a
Week. Several of the candidates
for positions were Formerly
stars in the scholastic \vorlrl.
('assavant, who was a member of
the Albany ll. S. team, seems to
be one of the best men out.
Among the others on the squad
are: ll. l.ohdell ’18, Le Grys
‘17, Williams ’20, Springman ’20.
Zeilman ‘19, V. Lobdell '20,
\\’all<erl17, Snyder ‘2o. Suther-
land ‘Io, limbs '18, l), ’J‘mvnsend
‘tﬂ. Nenner '20, Curtin ’19,

u‘ortb ‘20, Machlahon ’20, and
