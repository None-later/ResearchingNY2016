those who are least qualified
from entrance. it will in all
probability not be necessary to
enforce this method of limiting
the number of students this
fall, but next year with the
limit reached it is sure to go

NO SUCCESSOR ’1‘0 DEAN
BLUE HAS YET BEEN
APPOINTED.

No final action on ﬁlling the
vacancy caused by Dean
Leonard A. liluc’s death has
yet been taken. Dr. Rrubacher
will need considerable time to
canvass thoroughly the candi—
dates for the position and in
the meantime the dean’s duties
will be divided among various

members of the faculty.

 

STUDENTS FROM OTHER
COLLEGES ENTER 8. C.

Come Here to Finish Their
Courses. .

The number of upper class—
men from other colleges who
entered State College this [all
also greatly exceeds that of
former years. Another boost
for State College! When any
student, leaves his Alma Mater,
his first love as it were, and
in preference chooses State
(.‘ollege for the institution
where he wishes to earn his
degree, it. generally is a fairly
sure indication of what is
thought by them of our college
in comparison with other in‘
stitutions of learning. This
year’s contribution comprises
students from the College of
the City of New York, Hunter
College. the College of New

Rochelle. Elmira College,
Hamilton College. \Velleslcy

College, and Syracuse Univer-
sity.

SORORITIES.
Five at State College, All in
Flourishing Condition.

All newaomcrs among the
girls will undoubtedly be in-
terested in a brief statement
about the sororities of the col-
lege, although, if the male
element of 1920 is up to S. C.
standard, this interestrwill by
no means be monopolized by
the weaker (E) half of that;
class. There are now five
sororities among the girls of
State College and all of them
are splendid organizations,
thriving and prosperous, and
doing much to make college
life more college-like. They
are named below according to
their age, the name of the
present incumbent of the presi-
dency of each being given
opposite the respective soror—
ity. (To avoid any possible
misumlerstanding we wish to
reiterate right here. that the
order is according to the age
of the .s‘ororflfcx and has abso—
lutely nothing to do with the
age of the five presidents.
This caution is being taken
because the volume of business
so far has not been sufﬁcient to
enable the ltditor to take out a
life insurance policy.)

You have thus been properly
introduced, let us acquaint you
also with the manner in which
these above named sororities
fight for the privilege of mak-
ing you one of the fold “’c
warn all that this is legalized
warfare, governed by a set of
inter—sorority rules. which are
held very strict-and must be
obeyed carefully by all. The
importance of these rules
makes their publication at this
time and in this opportune
place almost a necessity.

one rush party within five

YOUNG WOMEN’S CHRIS~
TIAN ASSOCIATION.

 

Something About the Organi-
zation.

One of the livest organiza—
tions in the college is the
Y. W. C. A. No one at all in-
terested in student activities
can long be in college without
coming under the spell of its
its members
will make it their duty to look
you up, but if you care to be
associated with a real live-wire
society make it your own to
look up them.

This fall as in former years
the Y. W. C. A. has published
a little handbook which con—
tains much valuable informa—
tion and which every new-
