COLLEGE ORCHESTRA
PROMISING.

Arnold NoIde is Getting To-
gather a Good Organization.

Prospects for an efﬁcient and
successful orchestra in the col—
lege this year are very bright.
“Chief” Nolde ’19. who re<
organized the orchestra last
year and put it on a “ sonnrl ”
footing, has made great plans
for the coming season and says
it will not be his fault if they
don‘t come true. He is plan—
ing a regular concert—orchestra
of ﬁfteen or possibly more
members and has acquired a
good selection of concert num-
bers. it may be arranged to

’have the orchestra play during

chapel exercises in the audi-
torium once or twice. a week.
Most of last year’s members
are back; at least there is a
good nucleus to start with.
Ilesides havingr a concert or—
chestra there will be a second~

I ary orchestra made up of the

cream of the main organizze
tion. The mission of this
smaller combination will b, to
supply music for dancing: its
good work last year 111akes a
successful season a certainty.

-co1ner ought to maketit her
business to get. Many were
sent out by mail, but if you are
one of those .who did not re-
ceive one see Miss Ethel
.lIouck ’17, and one will be
handed to you.

At the first activity of the
year, a- weekly meeting, to be
held next Tuesday in the
auditorium, the purpose of the
organization. its work 'here in
college, and the 111eaning and
(:1blig'ations of membership will
be explained. Every girl in
the college is most cordially
invited. Freshmen and other
new students, this means you
too.

Duringr the summer the
Y. W. C. A. sent a delegation
to the Annual Eastern Field
Student Conference held at
Silver Bay, on beautiful Lake
(ieorge. There are eighteen
girls in college to whom the
mere mention of Silver Bay
suggests rippling waters, whist-
pering trees. sports of all
kinds, evenin sings with six
hundred and seventy—five g’it‘ls’
voices, and all sorts of whole-
some work and play. Those
fortunate enough to enjoy
these pleasures this summer
were: Dorothy Craning‘er,
Laura Smith, Mary lClla blue,
Carolina [.ipes, Lorisa Veddcr.
h'larguerite Stewart, Mildred
llentley. Marion Payne, Helen
Kelso, Eleanor Dunn, Marion
I’ntnam. Clara Slot-k. Anna
Harlow, Ruth Kimmey, Eloise
Lansing. .\lla Sahler. Nina
johns, and last. but by no
means least. the president of
the Y. W. (I. :\., lCdith \Vallace.

One important and sun ss-
ful feature of the Y. W. C, A.
\vork in the college is :1 lunch
counter, which is conducted
by .'\t45tlt‘itllinll girls in the
basement of the Science build-
ing’. They furnish there good
\vholesmne food to the college
people. at prices within the
bounds of reason.

It is the desire of. the V. \V.
t'. A. people to give every pos-
sible assistance to the girls of
the college. The fact that it
was a V. \V. girl \\1 ho met you
at the station, or that it was a
Y. \V. girl who helped you
make out your schedule or
helped you find a boarding"
house is abundant proof that
thev are succeeding:

watch the v. w. (7. A. bul~
letin board in the lower hall
and also the columns of the
State COIICLI‘C News for notices
: of further activities.
