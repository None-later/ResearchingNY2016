NEW YORK STATE COLLEGE EOR‘TEACthg

DR. BRUBACHER WEL-
COMES STUDENTS.

Auditorium Crowdcd to Limit—-
President Makes Address.

On Thursday morning, Oct.

5, during:r the ﬁrst chapel exer~ v

cises of the year, Dr. Brubacher

took occasi n to welcome in'

his own name as well as in'

that of the faculty the student— ‘
body to its work renewed or‘
in the once so very'

begun.
large seeming auditorium every
seat was taken. and this, the
l’residcnt said in opening his
address. made us realize that
the college is rapidly becoming
crowded beyond its facilities.
in continuing he pointed out
that this is a particularly in-
teresting time to enter upon

college work. a time that has a.

certain fascination previously
not known. The present day
preparedness propaganda,

which is not limited to miliw

taristic lines. suggested the

idea that the students of State
College, also, should prepare.’

Theirs should be an educa-

tional preparedness. a mobiliza— '
tion preparatory to taking up-
their life’s work. In doing this.

the student should shrink from
excessive mobilization along,r
some one specific channel, for

like the special trained cavalry"

has been found useless in the
European war and has had to
be trained anew- for other pur-
poses, so would the average
student who specializes in ex-
cess be found useless as a
teacher in most high schools
to—day. Dr. Brubacher said he
was reminded of his own ex-
perience as a country school
teacher. when he not only
taught all subjects, but acted
as his own janitor as well.
Versatility is really of greater
value than specialization. He
pointed out the tendency of
students to take up those sub—
jects which are called for in
the high school curriculum.
But courses like Sociology,
Economics, History of Phi-
losophy and Fine Arts have
large educational values, and
he urged the students not to
neglect these ﬁelds when
mobilizing. Enlarging upon
this topic the President stated
that there is nowa large ,call
for teachers, and that this in-

PASSED AWAY.

Was Prominent Educator—At
One Time Member of S. C.

Professor Le Roy Clark

bers of State College Alumni,

stitution in 1855. died on Sep—
tember 20. in his eighty—fourth

After leaving the then State
Normal School in 1855 Pro--

WIRELESS STATION A”!
STATE COLLEGE.

Installed Under Supervision of Dr.
Hale and Edward Long ’x7.

Perhaps only few of the
students know that we have
means in our college to get into
direct communication with
places hundreds, yes thousands
of miles away. The wireless
station which has been added
to the laboratory equipment of
the Physics department is that
means. It was installed last
spring under the supervision
of Dr. Hale and Edward Long
’i7. For some time a high iron
pole that had been erected on
top of the Science building re-
mained a mystery to many.
until one day there was seen a
number of shining wires ex-
tending from the top of the
pole across the space between
the Science building and the
boiler house to the top of the
high brick chimney, when it

V was clearly established in the

minds of all that these wires
constituted the aerial of a wire-
less outﬁt, but only a few have
found out the details given to
a “News” reporter and pubs
lished here. .
The transmitting apparatus
is installed in the inneroﬁice
of the Physics department and
from there messages can be
sent to stations as far as two
hundred miles distant. The
transmitting apparatus has a
capacity of V; K. W. The re-
ceiving set has a range of
several thousand miles, so that

‘S. C. station is in touch with
all coast stations, ships at sea'

and even some of the large

1 European stations.

The station is primarily to be
used in connection with Phys—
ics courses 9 and II. For .that
purpose two sets of receivers
are provided for the use of
instructor and student.
But it may serve many other
purposes. ,Already the stand-

ard time is being received'from '

the Arlington station and the
clocks of the Physics,‘depart-
ment are set by wireless each
day. Also there is a possibility

, of communicating with.other
: colleges.
