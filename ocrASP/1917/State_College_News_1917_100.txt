friends of the college, among

compresses and 715 sponges
have been made. under the able
direction of Mrs. Kinnear. So
far oiily 43 people have signed
up for this work. Considering,r
the number of girls registered
in college, this is much too
small a number, 'l‘herefore.

CROSS COUNTRY RUN

 

 

On Saturday, Nov. 2;. at 2
p. iii., will be held the annual
cross country run. The run—
ners will start at the end of the
park and take the route around
the lake. it is a matter of
speculation as to who will carry
off the prize. Sutherland, the
winner for the last two vans.
is still in school and has been
practicing for the past month.
“ Dewey ” Townsend, who won
Second place last vear. is c ii<
sidel'ed as a possible winner.
He did first ‘ate work last sea—
son. ln practice he is coming
along in line shape. but so far
he couldn’t sprint at the tin‘sh
strong enough to outrun Suth-
erland. Little Fitz of basket-
ball fame has entered the ranks.
He is setting an example for
the rest of the varsity basket—
ball men by his training for
Faturday's race.

Coach M aroney has asked
every basketball :andidatc to
get in training and cnten the
race. He says that it is a line
form of early season basketball
training. There is no doubt
but that a fellow's “ wind " is
put in better condition by it——
and this is all important for
every man who gets out on the
court.

Other fellows who are con~
sidered as likely winners on
Faturday are Harry, the speedy
forward; Cohen. one of the fast
men on last year's squad; Lich-

Miss Arnold Speaks at
Collggli Club

A record attendance crowded
to hear Dorothy Treat Arnold
give the story of her expe-
riences at the front. Miss Arn-
old began with the old sayingr
which is very appropriate now
~r-” Every man has two conn-
tries—his own and France."
The streets of France are
marked by wounded men. The
god-mother idea — that of each
one of us adopting a soldier
and writing to him twice a
month. is becoming very popn~
lar. Miss Arnold described the
delight the soldiers take in this
friendliness and asked us to err
ter into it.

Miss .-\rnold said she went to
the war zone in May. Signs
marked the ruins of churches
askit'ie; the passersby to re—
member the sacredness of the
spot. In the ravaged towns,
houses and streets have lost.

returning to them 'annot
recognize them. One very
prominent sign is that of

lly the nature of it. people cati-
not tell its pre:-'cnce. The eyes
water however and that is a
:ill‘ll to put on the gas mask at
once. The chateau of the farm
ous Cinssey family which
Richelieu could not blow up be—
‘anse France did not have
enough powder. was wrecked
by the Germans. Sixty thou-
sand pounds of powder were
used to blow up the central
portion.

The soldiers love attention of
any kind—pink and blue pa—
jamas delight them. and are
made more acceptable by a
present in the pocket. For the
refurces. friendship and sym—
pathy are more pleasing than
charities. One who ‘an go
throuin these ruined homes
and spread cheer and love is
doing; a great work.

Perhaps the most exciting
exi‘iei'icnce Miss Arnold de-
scribed was the time she saw
a German aeroplane dropping
bombs. It was spotted by a
searchlight so clearly that the
iron cross on its under side
could be seen. The French
guns opened fire on it. but to
no avail.

 

The most important thing to
the Alsatians is to be French
again. They are willing to pay
the price. The suffering all of
these great people endure, is
endured not alone for F mice
but for civilization. Many of
the students present, examined
and translated some of the
signs which the Germans had
posted in Allied territory.
which has since been evacu—
ated. ()ne of these was in re-
;l‘ai‘d to the execution of F.dith
Cavell and her coll tagues.

Many of the girls asked Miss
.‘\l'lltiltl what they could do that
would be. of service. She told
them of the dire need for surgi-
cal (.lressings. which can be, and
are beingr made right here in
the lied Cross sewingr room in
college. The need for surgical
dressings is constant.-«~ for in
many instances woniids are so
large alid of such area that
dozens of gauze sponges are
used at each dressing, and these
wounds have to be dressed
three and four times a day.

Anyone hearingr Miss Arnold
talk, could not help vowing to
him or herself, to spend every
spare moment down in that lit—
tle sewing room in the lower
hall. making surgical dressings
for the Red Crr It takes a
person who has been “over
there” to bring home to us the
importance of even so humble
a service as making surgical
dressings.

SPECIAL ASSEMBLY

 

 

Tuesday morning at
o’clock, a special student as-
seinny was held for the pur«
pose of bringing the general
student body into action along
lines needingr immediate atten—
tion. Now that the basketball
season is to open the first week
in December. it is high time we
considered the matter of cheer-
ing at the games. At a recent
meeting of M yskania, three
men were nominated to run for
cheer-leader — Merrill Sauer-
brei, Lawrence McMahon. Ed-

A vote by ballot was taken,

STUDENT Asssmistii

 

On Friday, November six-
teenth, the student body list-
ened to a stirring address by
Prof. Rislcy on the subject
“Americanism.”

.l’rof. Rislcy began with the
oft—repeated but as yet far
from realized statement, that:
we are at war. This fact has
been borne in upon us as we
have seen the streets of this
very city crowded with men
having:r for service. To the in-
telligent mind the question
must occur, “Why is it worth
lighting for?” In the asking
and answering of this question
there is no disloyalty, but only
a strengthening of the faith we
have. The past answers this
question for the historian, since
he deals in the past. For him
the examples of the men who
fought in the Civil war are
enough to cause him to answer
that it is worth ﬁghting to keep
what these men died for.

lii the past, we, as a nation
have iiinch neglected the traits
of Aniericanisin. The traits of
other countries have interested
as to the diminishment of our
own development, \Ve have
thought we had nothing worth
the light to maintain. Our
schools have thought that citi-
zenship was not worth culti-
vating. They have often neg-
lected to emphasize the good
side of men and politics, and
have sent students forth aghast
with knowledge of public viec
instead of aglow with surety of
the victory of virtue. The
schools have often taught
American history from a biased
viewpoint. Even abroad we
have disgraced our citizenship
by exposing our worst side. In
foreign lands we are known as
curious. rudely provincial,
boastful of our political corrup-
tion, blustering, without spirit.

7“ is not to be wondered that

we are considered unable to
light, pacifists by nature rather
than choice.

But there are positive Amer-
ican traits decidedly worth cnl-
tivating. First, consider our
boundless energy—that of a
young people. \Ve have. in—
deed, made many mistakes due
to this energy. bit we are a
pioneer nation, and our pioneer
mistakes will be corrected by
pioneer common—sense. A sce«
ond trait is our sure belief in
the natural rights of man. A
