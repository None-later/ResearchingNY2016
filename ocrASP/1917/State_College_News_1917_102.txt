i‘ OFFICIAL NOTICES

V The library has recently been
the recipient of a gilt of about

’40 volumes and a number of

magazines and pamphlets from
Miss Christine C. Fowler.
They are on professional sub-
jects and will he of decided
value to the students. Besides
this, the spirit in which they
were given is peculiarly en-
couraging at this‘ time. Miss
Fowler said, “I feel that the
library has suffered so many
losses at the hands of the
students that we should do
what we can, individually, to
offset this.” This is the sort of
college spirit which will make
possible an adequate college
library.
