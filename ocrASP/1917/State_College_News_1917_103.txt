SPECIAL ASSEMBLY.

the contest was extremely
close—220 for Saucrbrci, and
288 for McMahon. The songs
and yells which will he uscd
this year will be in the
“News” next week.

Christmas is coming tool It
is time to get ready soldiers’
Chirstmas boxes. The meeting
was called on Tuesday, instead
of waiting until Friday, as it is
necessary to have the money
collected Friday morning.
Omicron Nu is to have charge
of' buying for, preparing. and
mailing the boxes. As our
honor men are scattered all
over the country it is most
necessary to start the work im—
mediately. Merrill Saucrhrci
proposed that each student
bring ﬁve cents to chapcl Fri-
day morning for the purpose of
sending to each of our honor
men. a Christmas box. This is
a chance [or every student to
show his or her appl‘cciatirm of
what these men are doing, It
is a way too. in which we can
show them that ” State College
spirit " still livcs.

late cxamplc of this was Wil-
son’s reply in August to the
Pope's peace proposal. Third—
ly, we believe in fair play.

This is a trait we possess to“

a remarkable degree. We can
even hear dclcat. if need he.
” Hit the line hard, fear God,
take your own part " is a typi-
cal American slogan. America
puts its women first; Germany
docs not. America believes
that right makes might. Since
the cause is just. we will be
hard to defeat. Fourthly. we

are willing to sacriﬁce. a trait

founded by American mothers
for the liberal education of
their children. The practical
test of this trait is: how much
are we who rcmain behind. not
slackers but those left, going to
do to make the boys over there
feel that America’s philosophy
and spirit is worth ﬁghting
for?
