The exercises began in the

inspiring service at the main cu-
trance of the building.

l)r. Iirubacltcr’s introductory
remarks were as follows:

"Our interest this morning:
centers in the idea of service.
From our midst have gone some
thirty choice young men at the
call of country to defend the
principles of free government.
government by the consent of the
g‘m‘crnment: to redress the.
wrongs of weak nations: to de—
fend womanhood against vio-
lence: childhood against in—
l‘ut‘nun cruelty: a free people
against slavery, Knighthood
was never more distinctively dis-
played than by these young,r men
who are now enduringr the
dangers, hardships and stiffer-
ings of grim war. So severe are
the conditions of their service, so
great is the physical strain, so
hitter the anguish of some that
these princely young men could
not endure except as they are
nerved by high resolve and by
high devotion to duty.

” We are paying heartfelt
tribute, hnm-bly expressed, in the
flags which will proudly wave its
stars, each star vocal with praise
and promise. It is our pledge to

these boys who have gone forth

to dare, that we will he true to
them at: home. We pledge to
them a united nation, resolved to
devote to the common cause
every bit of wealth and energy,

 

and wisdom and loving devo-
tion, to the end that. humanity
may be free to pursue happiness
and to enjoy liberty. And we
pledge to ottr boys by this flagr
that we will keep the homeﬁres
burning for them where we hope
and pray to receive them after
the heat and turmoil of the bitter
years.

"()111‘ boys have gone. forth
into a noble cause. animated by
niotiycs that differ from those
that have in other times urged
men into wars. instead of con-
quest and aggression, we seek
justice for oppressed lleleium
and Serbia and France; in place
of military glory, we seek the
grandeur of an abiding; peace; in
place of indemnities, we seek to
establish tnerely assurance of
safety for common humanity; in
place of the cruclties of war, we
seek to establiin the qualities of
mercy; in place of inflicting,r suf—
fering and slavery on a van—
quished people, we are goingr
forth to rescue the oppressed
and the unfortunate; in place of
irresponsible autocracy. we
would secure freedom and the
blessings of political liberty. in
honor of the boys who are striv—
ing for these high achievements.
we shall unfurl our service ﬂag.”

'l’rofessor Kirtland read an
“Ode on the 'l‘arting of Our
Troops for France," by John T.
Chapnutn. We quote it here. in
part. but no one can really ap-
preciate its greatness until they
have heard it read the way it was
this morning:

And prayers went up in many a
tongue,
And sects dreamed, and poets
sung
And sages prophesied.
And lo, before the echoes died
Of that great pacan, there
arose
A state that to the dream re-
plied,
And gave the saints repose.”
11: 1: 1r a: It!

“Go, Western Warriors! Take
the place
The ages have assigned you in
a strife
Which to have died in were
enough of life, ‘
For you there waits. a quest
Such as no paladin or hero

<new
Of all who lifted sword or
wielded mace
Since George the Dragon
slew ;
For you a sacramental
feast
Too rich, too happy, too fulﬁlled
Of all that man c’cr craved or
God hath willed
Too blessed to be offered save
to you."

Spectecular Race

Barely Beat: Barry, ’51:; itgﬂacketball Squad who
come: in Secon

With Dean Homer’s “go” the
Io men started in the initial spurt
with Town-send ’18 leading off
at a pace which broke all records
for the ﬁrst quarter. As the
runners rounded the upper end
of the lake, Townsend still had
a good lead over Sutherland ’19,
who was gainingr fast, Barry ’21
and Fitzgerald ’20 coming next,
but several yards ahead of the
bunch. Sutherland, keeping a
constant pace, gained steadily on
Townsend and at the bridge they
were running evun. 0n the level
stretch between the bridge and
the boathouse, Sutherland led
away from Townsend, who was
showing results of his fast start.
Their positions had not changed
as they reached the half—mile
mark. but Barry and Fitzgerald
were in hot pursuit of Townsend.
h'fcrchant had weakened and
fallen in the rear. Masson and
Nicholson were grimly ﬁghting
for fifth place.

\thn the boathouse was
reached the order was Suther—
land, ’.tewnsend, Barry, Fitz-
gerald, Ma:sbn, Nicholson, with

 

Castilleno bringing up the rear.

With a ﬁnal spurt up the hill,
Sutherland maintained his sub-
stantial lead. Townsend, fast
dropping behind, was passed by
Barry and Fitzgerald. Suther-
land crossed the ﬁnish line in
5 minutes 25 1/5 seconds. Barry
crossed three yards behind, a
close second. Fitzgerald was
third. Every man who started
ﬁnished, the others coming in in
the following order: Masson
’19, Townsend ’18, Nicholson
’2r, Merchant ’19, Lobdell ’19,
Neuor ’19 and Castilleno ’2!.

The extreme coldness slowed
up the race. Sutherland fell
behind his record breaking run
of last year by 8 seconds, while
Townsend last year rounded the
course in 5 :33, as second man.
The short interval between the
winner and the last man,
together with the ﬁne condition
in which each man ﬁnished,
speaks well of the efﬁciency
which marks .Coaeh Marooney's
training. Great interest was
manifested by both students and
faculty who lined the course at
the ﬁnish.
