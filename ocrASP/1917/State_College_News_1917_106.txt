S. T. C. FURNSHES STATE
TEACHERS" ASSO. WITH
SPEAKERS

The 72d annual convention of
the New York State 'l‘eaehcrs'
Association will be held in Syra-
cuse Novmnber 26-28 inclusive.
There will be three general ses-
sions besides the meetings of
twenty-three auxiliary bodies.

This :ssociation is of particu-
lar interest to State College stu—
dents because of its relation to
the problems of teachers and be—
cause of the part Dr. .Ilrubacber
has had in determining its recent
policy. [.Tntil lol3 the meetings
were. intended primarly to brim,r
educators together for discus-
sion of cdncaliomti matters and
to renew acquaintances. in this
year In. iirubacher, then super-
intendent of scin'tols at Schenec—
tady, was elected president. He
set out to make the association
an active factor in the better—
ment of teachng and the
teachers’ condition in this State.
For this purpose the entire or~
ganizatiou "was changed. Local
county associations were formed.
each sendng delegates to the
central convention while the can
tral convention. through its ex—
ctutive and legislative commit—
tccs, worked for such progres-
sivc measures as “'i‘eachers' i-‘en-
sions," “A Code of lithics,”
“ improve Sanitary Conditions,"
etc.

As a result of his active policy
of reform i)r. lirubacller was
prevailed upon to accept the
presidency a second time that his
work might not be interrupted.
The result is scen in the 'l'cac.h~
ers' Pension Law and the present
smooth workng of the associa-
tion.

APPEAL T0 STUDENTS
AS CANDY-ENTERS
AND CANDY-
MAKERS

'i.‘he approach of the holiday
season generally means a greater
demand for candies of all kinds
and therefore an incrc ‘ l stip-
ply of them. Owing to the scare-
ity of granulated sugar, and to
the necessity for conserving it
as much as possible to prCVent a
sugar famine in the country,
food conservation workers ask
and urge the cooperation of
everyone in carrying out the fol-
lowing suggestions.

The reason that this is being
asked is this: liefore the war,
li‘rance. italy and Belgium pro-
duced as much sugar as they
used, while lingland drew most
of her alpply from what are now
enemy countries. New France
and itaiy are producing less than
they need, while. England is cut
off from the source of seventy
per cent of her usual imports.
These three allied countries must
now draw two million pounds
more of sugar than they (lid be-
fore the war from the some
sources frqu which we draw our
supply. We must divide with
them. We can do it by econo-
mizing. The. usual American
consumption per person is just
double that of France.

With these facts in mind, it
behooves us all to mould our
conduct accordingly. Let us,
first. create a demand for and
purchase only candies made
without the use of granulated
sugar. Let us in making" candies
ourselves, use brown sugar, mo-
lasses, maple syrup, corn syrup.
honey. etc., as substitutes for
white sugar. Let us cooperate
with Inanufm-turcrs to make this
movement a success.

This appeal may be personally
applied in a variety of ways.
Cannot popcorn, nuts and fruit
be as l in partial substitution for
candi s Cannot cakes be
frosted in moderate proportions
—~or, better still, not at all?
Cannot honey, maple syrup and
dark syrups for hot cakes and
wafﬂes be used without butter
or sugar? Cannot YOU use less
sugar in the tea and coffee?
Think it over.

it is not necessary to go with
out candies. it iS necessary to
do some straight thinking before
satisfying the demands of one’s
sweet tooth. Regard it as a
privilege rather than a privation
that you, as a patriotic student
of the times, may supply your
wants and those of your friends
without retarding the efforts of
your country to feed itself and
its allies.

.iesides—here’s a chance for
you to be original. Send War
Candy to your friends with an
explanatory note, instead of the
customary granulated sugar pro—
ducts. Try making honey and

 

 

 

 

nut bars with one cup huts or
cocoanut, two cups raisins, one-
fourth cup honey; grind nuts
and raisins in a food chopper,
mix with honey, pack under a
weight for a day, then cut into
bars. Or make one of the many
Karo candies, such as this one:
One cup brown sugar, one cup
Karo corn syrup, two table—
spoons meited butter, one table—
spoon lemon juicc, cook all to—
gether without stirring till brittle
when tested in cold water; pour
into buttered pans till cool
enough to pull.

With these suggestions, face
your conscience. The result re-
mains with you.

FORMER S. T. C. MAN
RAPS “ CROOKED
THINKING”

Ext-Senator Ralph W. Thomas
Gives Stirring Patriotic
Address

One of the ﬁnest addresses
ever listened to by State College
students was given last Friday
morning in student assembly by
the lion. Ralph W. 'i.‘hom-as, of
“ham. .ln introducing the
speaker, President Brubachcr
said that he is an ex-senator, ex-
college professor and is at pres—
ettt a member of the New York
State Tax Commissitm.

in his opening remarks Mr.
Thomas said that he felt at home

‘in State College, having been a

student here when it was the old
Normal on \Viiiett street. He
paid a glowing tribute to our
former president. William i.
Milne, in the following para—
phrase, “ (liven a room and two
chairs, a student in one and Wil-
liam J.-)lilne in the other, and
you have a college for teachers."

The speaker pointed out an
Athenian traditional oath which
was taken by every young man
when reaching manhood, one
sentence of which is especially
signiﬁcant for Americans to-day,
" i will not leave my country less,
but more. and better, than i
found it." The sentiment is
active, not passive. Each indi-
vidual must [)0 something.
American patriotism lacks this
element. We are a well»meaning,
patriotic people, but we are drift—
ing, subject to the gusts, as is the
brown October leaf. Everyone
who takes that oath has a patri-
otic duty to perform and a sac-
riﬁce to make. America should
bring out this classic patriot-
ism. ‘

It is impossible to name all the
things which constitute this.
There is one element which it is
the duty of every State College
student as a future teacher to
consider, namely, straight think-
ing, the intellectual power to see
a goal and the determination to
go there. This is the only
patriotism worth while.

 

Truth as a principle is clearly
differentiated from error by Wal-
lace in “lieu blur,” where he
says that truth is a straight line,
always straight, and error is like
a circle, ever round.

“An old fault in education,”
said Mr. Thomas, “ is in not
teaching pupils to think straigl‘lt.
l'npils can demonstrate a geo-
metric problem from- proposition
to conclusion correctly, yet can-
not arrive at a correct conclusion
concerning life.”

Several examples of the
American failure to think
straight was cited. In one case,
the speaker heard a young, ap-
parently well-educated man rea—
son that if $r3,5oo.ooo were put
aside yearly by the working class,
it would not be long before there
would be no money in circula-
tion. lie further called attention
to an agitation] urging that the
l'. S. government issue enough
greenbacks to make every man a
millionaire. The fault with the

W. \V.'s is that they think
crooked, putting,r their salaries
ﬁrst, They need to learn to
think first things ﬁrst.

Another example of inability
to think straight and to see that:
wrong and right exist, and that
wrong should be righted, is seen
in the pacifist of to—day. A
pacifist may not be a soapbox
orator. Anyone who wants to
conclude a German peace, who
wants to bring a renewal of the
cataclysm of to-day a century
hence, is a pacifist. The woman
who wrote in the Century Mam
usinc for October, “What has
this loathcsome war to do with
us? What is this wickedness
to you and me?” speaks the
thoughts of every pacifist
When we. remember Edith Ca-
val, murdered through German
planning, is not such a paciﬁstic
thought impossible?

Recently ltaly lost in three
days what. she has struggled for
two years to keep, all because of
weak, crooked thinking. It is
true that such thinking is not pre—
valent to an alarming degree, but
it is too common. While such a
condition exists, every American
teacher has a mission. We are
glad that the classic patriotism is
dominant. Let us help to keep it
dominant! it is our duty to
overcome the psychological bar-
rier which is felt by every
American soldier. It is only a
little which we can do for those
who have gone to give their
lives', perhaps, for God and truth.

In a closing address to the
studenntbody Mr. Thomas said,
“ Teachers, go forth and try to
overcome the tendency for
crooked thinking, and to lead to
straight thinking. Everyone can
do his bit to turn our future
Americans who will think
straight. Let us take this oath,
‘God helping us, we will not
leave our country less, but more

i and better than we found it,”
