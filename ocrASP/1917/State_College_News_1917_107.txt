S. C. T. Honor. it: Recruits

Continued from Page I.

Joseph Walker ’18 acted as
student representative and said
in part:

“it is entirely ﬁtting and
proper that this great hour
should call forth from our stu-
dcntbody an expression of appre-
ciation, devotion and loyalty to
our brothers, whose names have
been here honored this morning.
The task, however, of expressing
what we all feel— what I know
we all feel— is not an easy one.
We know that these men have
stepped from our very sides
into the whirling maelstrom of
carnage and death, that has been
gradually drawing to itself
more than half of the peoples of
the earth. Out of an atmosphere
of culture, reﬁnement and intel~
lcctuality, they have gone to
suffer and to die, perhaps, that
we, who remain, may continue to
enjoy the heritage of freedom
that has been left to us. They
have gone —— we remain to watch
and wait for the call, the call
that eventually must come, to
make some sort ‘of contribution
to the cause from which they
have withheld not even their
lives.

 

” We are devoted to them be-
cause they rcprcscnt our an-
swer, the answer of this institu—
tion, to the challenge of fright—
lulncss, that has been thrown
into the face of civilization.
We are devoted to thcm because
they represent real [\nicricanism,
the old love of justice, the tra‘
ditional sympathy of America
for the oppressed. We are de—
votcd to them because they did
not fail to recognize their rc—
sponsibility and duty, as Ameri—
can citizens, to take a part in this
‘loathsome’ war. They did not
stand back and ask ‘What has it
all to do with us?’

“And ﬁnally, to those who have
not sought or who have not been
selected to lill a place in the na-
tion's service, bear in mind, that
there is small chance that ulti-
mater the opportunity will not
be given us. And while we wait
for that opportunity, let us keep
ever in mind the need of intense
loyalty to the nation and to those
who are maintaining its honor
and integrity. Great as are the
sorrows that this war must
necessarily bring, we must never
allow ourselves to question the
justice of America’s cause or the
need of forcing the war to a
victorious conclusion. Back up

 

our faith in these boys whom we
have [0-day joined in honoring,
with a greater faith that in the
eternal illness of things this war
can have but one cud, an end that
shall, through a new era of na—
tional honor and righteousness,
heal the scars of this struggle.
silence all hymns of racial
hatred, and make of the world a
brighter, happier place to live
~ 11

Dr. Harold ’l‘hompson lead in
singing “America, the Beauti-
ful,” after which the faculty and
sludcnts marched to the main
entrance of the college for the
unfurling of the ﬂag. Dr.
Richardson ollcred the follow—
ing impressive prayer:

0 Almighty God, Who art a
most strong lower to all those
who put their trust in Thcc: Bo
now and cvcrmorc our defense;
direct and prosper the cause of
our Country and of our Allies.
Give wisdom to our leaders and

to theirs that they may both

perceive and know what things
they ought to do and also may
have courage and power faith-
fully to perform the same. Take
under Thy protection our
soldiers and sailors, and all
those, who in any sphere of
action, are working together with

,.

 

them. lllcss the chaplains and
lllosc who minister in holy
things; inspire with skill and
tenderness the doctors and
nurses and help all those who do
service to the troops on land or
sea.

And cspccially do we com-
mcnd lo Thy gracious care our
lnothcrs. students of this Col-
lcgc, in conuncmoraiion of whom
we now raise this Scrvice li‘lag.
Nay their example of devotion
to duty inspire us and lead us to
endure all hardships and perils
in the holy cause which we and
our Allies are pledged to main-
min, and grant that this Emblem
may make us mindful of the
high resolve which we and they
have taken, to labor for the
relief of the oppressed and for
the blessings of Liberty, justice
and Honor among all men.

Lct Thy glorious 1najcsty,.O
Lord, be upon us. Prosper Thou
the work of our hands upon us.
0 prosper Thou our handiwork.
Amen.

Amid profound silence the
ﬂag was unfurled and thrown
to the brcczc, and as it straight—
cncd out its folds, thus bringing
its stars into view, all joined
with one accord in singing
“ America."
