COLLEGE CLUB

The room was taxed to its
capacity to hear Judge Brady

Friday afternoon, who spoke of -

the work of the Juvenile court
with which he. is connected.

He said that the court system V

of our country has undergone
radical changes in late years
and gradually the authorities
have to realize the importance
of treating the child not as an
adult hardened criminal but as
a child who is not really re-
sponsible for its behavior. It
is not right to place a child in
Drison to be with the men and
women old in crime. He said,
—“ If I were asde the quick-
est way to send a child to Hell,
id say put him in jail. What
he does not know of crime
when he goes in, he will learn
before he comes out."

Now, the court tries to be
tender with these unfortunates
and help them to become the
right sort of men and women.
The court asks the aid of the
child’s church and school an—
tlmritics. Some of these chil-
dren live in homes that are dis—
graceful and some homes are
broken up by the authorities.
He told the story of “ Jimmy,
The Rat” who came from one
of these miserable homes, and
shipped school because the
boys called him “The Rat.”
if the home is at least half a
home the child should be al-
lowed to stay there. if possible,
to be taught by the parents.
The teacher has a great in<
ﬂucncc on the child’s life and
the parents can tell the charac-
ter of the teacher by the table
talk of the children at home.

Then he told several stories of
cases he had met in court and
said thatalthough there is a
grout deal of sorrow in this
world, yet even in the court—
room there are many glimpses
of sunshine and fun.

DRAMATICS

tion to be stagcd by the Dra—
matics are in progress. The

duction under the direction of ‘
