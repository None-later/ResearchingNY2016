” SILVER BOX " A SUC-

CE ..

Given by Dramatics Class Before
Teachers’ Association.

The class in dramatics at
State college lived up to its
good reputation last Friday.
when it gave a clever perform~
an-ce of ~lohn tialsworthy’s
modem play. “"l‘he Silver
llox.” t is a drama which
deals with modern day life and
the faulty way of dealing out
justice in linglanrl. li‘inished
acting was necessary to enable
the audience to fully appro-
ciate the play. and the hearty
applause was testimony enough
that the players were not lack"
ing in that respect. \Vhile the
work of all was most satisfac-
torv. the very clever interpre»
tation of their parts given by
Kolin D. llagcr. Lois H. Knox.
and Mi: .Toseph Lasker must
be mentioned above the rest.
The following took part in the

play: Lois fl. Knox, May

and determined to make. their
opponents work for every point
gained. The two weeks’ rest
seemed to have done the men
a World of good. ’lfhey had
laid off for a whole week alto—
gether, but the week before the
game (,Toach lid Wachter had
the men out working hard.
The victory over St. John’s was
won with (ioewey, who res
ceutly umlcrwent an operation,
out of the game. l'lohaus, who
was substituted, played the
game of his life, being much
better than at any other time
this season.

The game was played on
Saturday evening. Febrnm'y
3rd, directly alter the Junior
banquet. The score of the
contest was 30:39. St. john’s
scored two baskets in quick
successitm and it began to look
like another defeat. However.
after about eight minutes ol
play the State College men hit
their stride and from then on
outplayed the St. John’s live in
all departments of the game.
The guarding of the Purple
and Gold was clearly the
feature of the contestant] the
main cause of  John’s defeat.
This is meant in regard to all
live men. \Vhenevcr a St.
John's man got the ball into his
poss sum the Purple and Gold
at once formed a wall across
the court which all the cun—
ning and skill of the Brooklyn
boys could not: break. It was
the style of play State College
fans have been waiting for and
which Coach W'achter is very
much in favor of having the
team use. Had the men relied
upon it in their game against
Springfield Y. M. ‘. . Col-
lege. it is safe to say they
would never have doubled the
score.

As regards the individual
efforts in the St. John’s game,
all that can in justice he said
is that every man did his best
and sacrificed his own interests
for those, of his team. Very
few useless shots were taken.
which is more than can be said
about most of the other games.
“Honey” Miller seemed to ﬁt
in well at center and he may be
drafted to that position perma-
nently.
