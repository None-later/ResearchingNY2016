Dr. Dugan Addresses

Not All Slacker: Are
Draft Evade"

“ Not all slackers are included in
the draft age," said the Rev. George
Dngan, chairman of the district ap-
peal board for Albany county, in an
address on “The Slacker" yester-
day afternoon before the College
Club.

"it is hard to deierinine who are
the patriots and who are the. slack-
ers in these days, but we are cer-
tain many more people come under
the category of the slacker than
have tried to evade the military
draft law. That percentage, all
things considered, was extremely
low according to the estimates
made by national boards". The men
who did evade the law were in most
‘ases mistaken or perhaps ignor-
ant, but the Illt'tl who are c\ ry day
evading moral responsibilities are
legion.

"The significance of the word
slacker is not profound. it means
one who is slack. lint the word as
it has come to be recognized every-
where sincc the English used it as
a term of contempt for men who
eradcd the call to arms, has a
greater significance than can he
well determined in words. its new
content will have a big part to play
in the vocabulary of the future and
its meaning will not be misunder-
stood. The man who is loosely
put together is not compactly bttilt,
and lacks backbone; the fellow who
agrees with the ideas of everyone
he meets and hasn't the stamina to
stand up for his own convictions:
the man who never br -asts the tide
but slides along on the drift of
opinion. there is the slacker for
you, He has no character and no
realiyaiion of the responsibilities
\'.'hi.'h are resting on him.

‘We used to have a forgiving
spirit for the man or woman who
went along in his or her own gait
in an easy. careless, selﬁsh sort of
way. We treated them with indul-
gence. llut that time has long since
passed. The man or woman who
evades responsibilities is just as
much a slacker as the chap who
plays tricks on the exemption
boa ( e are passing through a
critical period and it is up to each
one of us to discover our own
measure of responsibility and then
fulfill it,

"There are more slackers in the
churches of Albany than ever came
before the exemption board. The
women who sit at cards all day
when there .are great issues at
stake are as worthy of contempt
and we have just as much cause to
ostr'cize them from society as the
military cvadcr. The man whose
religion is in his wife's name is just
as liable to harsh treatment as the
man who tries ti lose weight so
that he may be exempted from scr~
vice. What are people thinking of
when they evade the tasks which
are before them? They say they
will not consider the many things
which need doing nowadays. They
have no time, their business. that
of keeping the home or earning
money, takes all their energy and
strength. Some one has to do the

 

 

 

 

Red Cross can 'assing. some one
has to go to headquarters day after
day, some one has to take care of
the soldiers‘ families and the sol-
diers‘ welfare. ho is going to do
it? Not the slacker but the people
who do not help in the good cause
are slackers and the sooner we can
brand them as such, the better for
the community."

 

DOCTOR ALFRED
THOMPSON ADDRESSES
STUDENT ASSEMBLY

Doctor Alfred Thompson of
llrockport, N. Y., addressed the
assembled students on Friday
morning, December seventh. Doe-
ior Thompson ranks high in ctlu~
cational circles of the State, and
has had experience in all kinds of
educational work. His subject was
“The School and the Job." in
brief, he spoke as follows:

"Opportunity stays but a mo-
inent, passes quickly by, may he
seized only as met, and when once
passed can never be caught.

"Our great public schools are our
chief defense, our bulwark of demo-
cracy, our opportunity. At the head
of the ptiblic school system stands
the high school. The high school
should fit not only for higher edu-
'ation, but for the active duties of
life as well. One of the most im-
portant aims of the high school is
to prepare students for college.
Whether a high school accom<
plishes this or not, is a sure test of
its efficiency. College gives depth
of knowledge and breadth of view
necessary in this age of keen com-
petition. (‘ollege gives traditions
which will help keep a man straight
while he is struggling for ground
to fight on. The time has gone by
when any btit college trained men
and women can hold important
positions.

“Many people cannot go to col—
lege. it is the duty of the high
school to fit these less fortunate for
their jobs, as well. The actual
duties that these people will have
to perform in their several posi-
tions cannot all he taught by the
high school, but certain principles
can be instilled into each pupil
which will help him whatever his
later occupation. Efficiency,
promptness. push and patriotism
are. among the these principles.
(liven these and the proper coord—
ination between head, hand, and
heart, and the individual has the
tools with which to erect a happy,
useful life.

RED CROSS NOTES

 

There is a greater demand than
ever )r surgical dressings. Mrs.
Kinni tr is at the Red Cross room
every Tuesday and Thursday from
f to 5. She will have the mater-
ia's with which to make the “front
line packets" for individual sol-
dicrs. These are very essential,
for every soldier who goes into the
first line trenches has one of these
packets with him. All who possibly
*an, come to room Bi, Tuesdays
and Thursdays, and help make
them. Girls, you who do not help
when you have the available time
are just as much “slackers” as the
men who are trying tavevade the
draft.

MEN’S 7&T}OGETHER "
GREAT SUCCESS

 

 

.\t t'lt‘\t'll o'clock Saturday night
a bunch of State College men gath—
ered in the Essex were asking one
another “who would have believed
it?” “What has brought about this
change?" “i never saw such col—
lepc spirit here as shown last night
and to-night." Sonic held that it
had been brought by the Fresh,
some that the new Dean was the
cause and others that Dr. Brn-
hachti's plans were beginning to
work. Whatever their ideas as to
cause, all agreed that the Men's
Get-to-Getber had been the biggest
social event for men in the past
three years.

The event was engineered by
Coach Maroney who covered him-
self with glory. Prof. Risley was
master of ccreinonies,—~enough
said. About seventy l‘aulty mem-
bers and students )articipatcd.
Coach Maroneybegan 1is program
with a punch, Ncuner and Wren
gave an exhibition of pugilistie
skill that made even Dr. Brubacher
come around with congratulations.
if you don't believe our Dean is
some sprinter you shouldliave seen
him take Doc. Conwel down the
floor in the three-legged race in
