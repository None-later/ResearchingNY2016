MERRY CHRISTMAS!

Real snow, slcighbclls, a group
of youngsters making a Santa
Claus snow man, and at last—
even though brought about by a
grim. cruel war—a real Christmas.

hcn, as youngsters. we used to
hear "grandpa" tell about " the
good old days," we wished we
might have lived in the time when a
fellow got that new pair of skates,
a good heavy toboggan, and big
" wooley " gloves, instead of a copy
of “ Hill, the Paddler," a stack of
red Neckties and a pair of sus-
pcndcrs in his stocking! liven to—
day we wish that for a day we
might forget the suffering and
horrors of war, and remember only
thc lofty, the beautiful aspects Hf
life. lint then, after this desire has
fairly gripped us, and we read or
think of Verdun aml Alsace, our
conscience condemns us. And then
a new idea springs to the front of
our reflections. Christmas is near!
We will make this a real risi-
mas by putting all of the iincncss
and the beauty we have into the
spirit of our gifts. And nmv when
we give, we’ll give for the sheer
love of giving to add just a bit more
of cheer and godliness to the livcs
of those who need it——-and they are
legion.

This year Slate (‘oilegc has the.
most wonderful tihristmas spirit it
has had in years! Our Red Cross
work, the soldiers‘ Christmas
boxes, and last and greatest, the
way  C. T. has startled the world
by its generous support of the Y.
M, C. :\. liund, shows that we’re

giving to-day as we never knew we

could give. And even though in
our gifts, necessity is the ruling
factor, our spirit is such that our
homefolks, as well as the boys in
camp, are going to be surprised at
our checrfnlness. We have
learned to give. Havingr really
tasted the happin-ss which comes
from making othch happy, we have
a peace of mind and vision enough
to make the whole world optim—
istie. [it’s such fun to dcny one’s
self in order to give someone some«
thing needed. Happiness. real hap»
pincss, obliterates the hardship of
self-denial, and makes the pure gold
shine out brilliantly against the
royal purple. With deepest pride in
our college and its Christmas
spirit, the “News” lioard extends
to all of its readers a most hearty
" Merry Christmas and Happy New
Yearl”

 

THE 1:15) CROSS ,

You have all heard that no one
has the right not to be interested in
anything. You all believe it, don’t
you? Then why not be interested
in. the fact that the Red Cross is
canu'iaigning for ten million memv
hers before Christmas? Members,
I say. The organization does not

ask for ten million dollars, no
matter how, but for ten million
members, who will bring interest
and ability as’wcll as dollars.

l‘erhaps you have sewed for thc
lied Cross, but it has another job
for you in ('hristmas vacation.
There is a call for every college
student to give at lcasl two of the
holidays to helping the Membership

here’s a chance for you. Men. you
haven't sewcd or made surgical
dr ings or knit socks. Don't
leave it all to the girls: this is your
chance.

Thcrc is no nerd to explain the
work [if this organization. We all
know where and how and wily il
works. Sincc wr- know, can we be
without our share in it? li‘rom now

retirement waitingr for a summons
to the trenches. Everyday they fol-
low the samc routine tirelessly.
lint, when rest time comes, they
have time to think and grieve of
their homes and families now scat-
tered all ovcr the land; some dead.
others missing, and ntbcrs captured

this drive anyone mad? These
soldiers reccivc very few letters of

unhappiness they go out into the
darkness of the evil night to a
verdict worse than dcath in its
harshness. You are needed here!
\«Vrilc to them, cheer them, give
them hope and a desire to live and

battle and the soldiers crawl
wearin into their dugonts. where
many times there is a foot of
waler, and where rats and mice
make their abode and it is oh, so
cold——thcn they would like a bit
of gladness to enlighten them. a
friendly snack of encouragement
and a bit of fun to enliven their
