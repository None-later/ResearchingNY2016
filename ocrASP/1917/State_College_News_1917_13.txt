DR. SKINNER ADDRESSES
STUDENT ASSEMBLY.
That the present linropean

war has vindicated the priir

ciples of democracy and shown
that as g1 ' men are produced
by democratic societies as in
monarchical was proven by Dr.
Avery l). Skinner. of the State
lidueation l,)epartntent, in
student assembly Friday morn—
ing. in. Skinner lirst dis-
cussed the historic background
of the war quite refuting the
idea that the, present catastro-
phe is the result of the :tssassi‘
nation of the :\nstrian l‘rince
and his consort or the desire to
preserve any humanitarian
aspect of civilization. Instead,
its causes were traced back to
the Congress of ISIS and the
revolutions of 1843. since which
there have grown up in lCuropr'
two types of nations, the one is
the “state with a soul," like
(iermany, in which the individ—
ual is sacriliced to the general
good. The other type is that:
in which the state exists for the
individual. The present strut:-
g‘le is a clash between these
two types of governments.
litom the geogrardiical point
of view Dr. Skinner called at-
tention to the great similarity
between the relations existing
between the European powers
and Africa in out and the rela—
tions between those powers and
North America at the time of
the colonial wars. He pointed
out: that if the development
from the steel into the electri—
cal age had not been partially
accomplished ltaly would not
have entered the war. it is
due to electrical generatingr
power of ltaly’s short moun-

tain streams that she. is now a

mannfacturint.r nation and ﬁght—

ing for colonial markets.

Although just at present.
line'land has become nearly as
absolute as Germany this is no
proof that democratic institu-

 

 

antocratic power is needed that
the nation may exert every
ounce of its energy in a crisis.
but when the crisis is passed
the country. it is believed by
many. will become far more
democratic than ever before.
it‘onrernine' the United
States. he believes that both
the Allies and (Tentral l’owers
are expectingr us to live up to
our lot] ' .‘ ablishcd reputation
for just ‘ ,, fair play and honor.

PROFESSOR YORK AD-
DRESSES COLLEGE
CLUB

()n liriday, February 9th.
l’rofessor York addressed Col-
legc Club. He spoke of the
value of business training to
college students.

lA‘rofessor York said that the
day of commercial education is
slowly dawning: The old
method of self-education by
means of apprenticeship is too
costly and too slow for men of
to—day. Gradually people have
become interested in business
education, and little by little
business schools have devel—
oped and courses in type-
writing', stcnoeraphy and book—
keeping;r have been introduced
into our schools and colleges.

'I‘hcse courses have a real
educational value and train
the mind in observation. con-
centration and imagination, as
well as do classical and scien-
tific. courses.

The teacher needs a business
as well as a classical education,
for it furnishes a practical
knowledge of the ways of the
business world, systematizes
the teacher’s habits of work,
and enables him to get better
results and hold higher posi—
tions.
