:\t the meeting of the Asso-

in the State. Education lluild—
ing Friday. a committee. of live
was appointed to devisu a
means for more ell'eetual con-
trol of college athletics. The
committee is headed by Chan-
eellor ('has. /\. Richmond. of

mcuds a sharper inquiry. both by

Team Plays Good Ball On Trip

 

Defeated but not Disgraced—Holds all
Opponents to Close Scores

Altl'tough the fact that the
Purple and (iold basketball team
did not win any of its games on
the New York trip just cont—
pleted may be a source of dis»
appbinment to some, yet the
more conservative observer will
be very much satisfied with the
record made. since the men suc—
ceeded to hold the teams of three
well-lotown colleges to close
scores on their own courts. ln

City.

until the final minutes of play,
and l'ratt also had to work hard
for every point scored. One
bright feature of the games was
the shooting from the foul line
by S. l'Vitzgerald. “ Iii};r Jiitz”
scored 32 points out of a possio
ble 40, which is a wonderful
record. Local sport scribes are
justly proclaimng him the cham-
pion foul shooter of inter-
collegiate basketball. and it may
