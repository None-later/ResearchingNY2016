TUSKEGEE SINGERS GIVE
SPLENDID ENTER-
TAINMENT.

Interesting Talk on History and
Purpose of Institution.

 

 

The Tuskegee Singers who
appeared before the students
during the regular chapel
period on last Friday morning
rendered a program which was
in keeping with the ﬁne repti-
tation they enjoy, of being,r one
of the best groups of negro
singers in the country. 'I‘he
most interesting part of their
program. however. was a talk
given by their leader on the
history and purpose of the
'l‘nskegee Institute.

The institution. the speaker
said, was founded only thirty--
five years ago by Booker T.
\‘\'ashington. Mr. Washington
at that time taught about thirty
boys and girls and used as a
schoolhouse an old. dilapidath
church building. It is said that
on rainy days one of the boys
had to hold an mnhrella over
Mr. Washington's head while
he was teachng the rest of the
class. The next buildingr added
was an old chicken house
which. the story goes. an old
negro cleaner] out at night. he
not beingr used to cleaningy out 'a
chicken house in the daytime.

The growth of the school has
been of surprisingr rapidity.
'I‘o—day there are over one hun
dred large. and small brick
building's, and the property of
the institution comprises
thirty-ﬁve hundred acres. /\n
interestingr fact about the build-
ing‘s is that the-students built
every one of them. they even
making their own bricks on the
premises. In fact the students

of 'l'uskegce do all the work?

necessary to run and maintain
the institution. All cleaning,
repairing. decorating, garden-
ing, etc., is done by the boys
and girls enrolled there. The
number of students has grown
from thirty to seventeen hun—
dred.

The speaker said that con‘
trary to the idea commonly
held in the North. there is noth-
ingr at all mysterious or strange

about this wonderful progress

of the negro in the heart of the
South. l-Ie defended the white
people of the South, saying that
in the North one never hears of
the best of the South. but that
the papers have a tendency to
emphasize the weaknesses, and
that hardly ever is an account
of the good (lone given. The
muthern white people, he said.
believe in the advancement of
the negro. As the white race
does much for them. so do the
colored people do much for
themselves. Examples are
common of poor negro parents
workintr hard and sacriﬁcing
much in order to be, able to

give their children an educzv
tiou. ' '
Tuskegee emphasizes indus-
trial and agricultural courses
for the men. The girls take up
cooking, millinery, dressmak-
ing. etc. The institution aims
to train all students to become
useful members of society. .It
stands as a monument to the
generosity of both races. The
speaker ended his interesting
talk by stating that the leaders
of the colored race realized that
their fellows represent in mine
hers oneieig'hth of the popula-
tion of America, and that their
one ambition is to have them
also represent onewighth of the
dignity of the country, one
eighth of the beauty, and one-

eig‘hth of all that means
America.
