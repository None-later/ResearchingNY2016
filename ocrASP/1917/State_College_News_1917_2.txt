in respect to spirit he L‘otnpared
t'ornell to State t'ollege, saying

school spirit and student eo—
operation.”

Niagara Wins Thrilling Game

of the opposing "lives," will
live long in the memories of
the lovers of the sport.

Never before was such a
brilliant spectacle enacted on
the high sehool eourt. 'I‘hrouglu
out the struggle there was not
a single dull moment. The
spectators, of which it seemed
nearly seven hundred were
present. were thrilled by the
brilliant Work on both sides.

The gymnasium was literally
packed: "the house was sold
out.” The Niagara men had a
mud number of loyal sup—
porters. even if they were a hit
tough and unreasonable. .\nd
plenty of cause they had for be—
ing so; State t'olleg‘e led the
seore up to the last few minutes
of play. 'l‘hisalong‘ with other
stimulants is enough to make
any one tuireasonable.

The game was eleanly played.
The Niagara live, be it said to
their credit. took defeat as
nicely and gentlemanly in the
greater part of the game as did
our boys in the end.

l’erhaps the greatest gratili—
ration to State College routers
was the most astounding leap
forward our men have taken in
the mastering of the sport.
They more than ever before dis-
played tlte skill and subtle
knowledge of the tricks of the
game essential to good basket
hall. Never before has there
been such absolute lack of in-
dividual work. The team
played as if the live were one
conglomerate hasket hall de<
mon. 'l‘hrougltout their spee-
taenlar playing, both on the (it‘-
lenses and when attacking,
there was evident the wonder~
fttl coaching of Ed. \'\"aehtcr.

The first score of the game
was made by S. lit‘itzgerald. who
caged the hall front the foul
line. The College crowd liter-
ally went wild.

Lynch of Niagara then scored
a field goal. placing them one
point ahead, but their joy was
short lived. Coewcy followed
with two ﬁeld goals. From
then on State College held a
eontfortahle lead to the close of
the first half. The score was
ten and six. The cheering was
deafening; never hcfore had
State College showed such
spirit.
