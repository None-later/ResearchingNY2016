CHEMISTRY CLUB.

 

 

At a meeting of the Chem-
istry Club. held recently, John
MacCracken gave a very inter—
esting talk on “ Industrial Alco-
hols." He mentioned briefly the
various sources from which
alcohols are obtained and told
about some of their uses. such
as solvents for different sub-
stances. their use in explosives.
and particularly their use as a

 

fuel in internal combustion en-
gines. The difﬁculties of listing
it for this last mentioned pur-
pose are: first, a source of ob-
taining' the alcohol without
using,r up any of the needed
food-stuffs from which it may
be manufactured; and second,
a substance that will be en-
tirely satisfactory as an agent
for dcnaturalimtion. there be-
ing large prizes offered for such
a substance. Of course. a
specially constructed engine
must be used, as the ordinary
gasoline engine will not work
satisfactorily with alcohol.

Miss Verna McCann was ap-
pointed as reporter for the
Club and will assume the duties
at once.
