different from the ‘anxious pa—
ticnee’ of Tebruary 26. 1917.
There is no established stand—
ard of adequate cause of war.
it is always an independent act
to be determined by the. con—
ditions of the time. and largely
by the ‘ animus fu'andi’ of the
aggrieved state. ltaly’s causes
of war against Tripoli do not
seem adequate; Austria’s ulti—
matnvm to Servia in [014. was
precipitate Causes of war
have often been trivial and have
generally been lost sight of be—
fore the war was over.

” Great Britain practically at—
tacker] the United States in the
matter of the Caroline. Daniel
\Vebster, then secretary of
state. laid down the accepted
rule ‘the necessity of self de-
fense must be instant. over-
whelming. leaving no choice of
means and no moment for do
liberation.’ Thus a nation may
perform an act of war to pre-
vent possible harm to itself.
The Virginius is another case
in point. Hence war oiten is
begun. not only from causes
that appear trivial. but even to
prevent an act. This indicates
that. the United States has not
lacked cause for action. pro—
vided that action is demanded.
\‘Vhen a hot headed maniac. in
the last throes of desperation.
runs amuck up and down the

 

streets of nations, something
should be done at some time.
Undoubtedly there would bet
some who would say that wei
were drunk with our own'
phrases, and that we had con-
fused parrotism with patriot—
ism.

“ But this intoxicant is not
served up to the American peo-
ple by the addresses of Presi-
dent ‘Wilson to Congress. it
we know how to read, it seems
that any talk about adequate.
cause for war is beside the1
mark.

” Read the message of last:
Monday; in it are ‘the neccs»
sity for detinite action may
com: at any time. if we are in
fact and not in word, merely, to
defend our elemental rights as
a neutral nation.’ ‘Only the
method and the extent remain
to be chosen, upon the occasion.
it occasion should indeed arise.’
This might lead to action. lint
note further, ‘l am not now
proposing or contemplating war
or any steps that may lead to
il.’ Armed neutrality is a
stopping place between peace
and war; while no one is anx—
ious for war, one wonders just
how many more stopping places
may be established. The con—
clusion of armed neutrality
came as a surprise. with a sense
of shock at its unexpectedness.

“The term armed neutrality
has been applied to the case of
a nation, a neutrali that keeps
an army, as Holland. but this is
an error. The term should be
used to apply to neutrals who
band together to obtain some
desired privilege from the hel-
ligerents and who threaten
arms if necessary. if the term
has any value it should he used
in this historical sense and not
be used indiscriminately. l: be—
lieve the United States lays it«
self open to criticism in this
matter. The privilege congress
has given our l‘rcsident is that
of armed defense and not armed
neutrality.

“Certainly it seems that any
discussion of adequate cause of
war arising from Germany's iii-
sult. to us is hardly in point
when the matter of armed neu-
trality o' armed defense is the
extent of our violence."

Prof. Stinanl Given Lecture on Cuba
Continued from Page |

 

 

never boast of a lirmly estab—
lished government. and it was
in that period that the Span-
iards acquired many of the
traits now manifest in their
Cuban descendants. Almost
from the beginning the Cubans
have looked upon government
as an instrument of oppression.
The taxes imposed upon them
during the nineteenth century
were indeed very excessive and
in the last half century the
Cubans were incessantly re-
volting against Spain. With
such lack of training on the part
of the Cuban it is 'hard to ex-
pect. Professor Stinard pointed
out. that they should exercise
the same cool-headedness and
self~control as the Anglo~
Saxon. The tendency towards
political unrest and revolution
is born within him.

'l‘he lecturer said that the
(‘ubans iavored Mexico in the
conflict l)ClWL'(’li that country
and ours. The North .'\meri«
cans are a foreign race to them;
they know us only from the
mouths of demagogues or from
American adventurers. The
Cubans hate to he reminded ol
what they owe us. They
claim that 'they have in added
trade amply repaid the United
States for what she has done.
They believe they Would have
won their freedom alone.

However. the educated class
believes that the (‘Ulili‘Ul oi
Amcina has saved them many

 

 

millions and much drudgery.
()ne Chiel cause of the present
rebellion is, said Prof. Srinard.
the fact that the present execu-
tiVC was educated in the United
States and seems to favor the
Americans.

in speaking of the com-
mercial side of Cuban life, the
speaker pointed out that since
Cuba has become a republic its
commerce has increased ma-
terially. In volume of trade
lriavanna now surpasses all
American harbors with the ex—
ception of New York. Sugar is
king on the island, with to-
bacco next. Contrary to com—
mon belief, Cuba does not ex—
port cot‘t'ce. in fact it does not
raise enough to supply its own
demand. .

Cuba represents an extensive
market for American goods.
especially dry goods. To speak-
ing of the causes of the appar—
ent superiority of European
salesmen over the American,
Prof. Stinard said that the
American made. the mistake of
trying to sell that which he
wanted to get rid of. instead of
curleavoring to supply that
whirh was needed. Also the
American is 'much too exacting
about: credit. which tends to
hurt the Cuban’s pride. flaw—
ever. of late. conditions have
been growing better and the
North and l..’illll-.‘\liit‘l‘i tans are
slowly arriving at a better
mulerstamling.
