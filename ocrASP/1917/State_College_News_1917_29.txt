VOTE “ YES " FRIDAY MORNING.

 

Friday morning the proposition of a tax on the students will be
brought up before the studcnt assembly. The students will be
asked to express by vote whether or not they favor such a tax.
The vote will in no way hold any one responsible and is not ﬁnal,
since no amount will be decided upon, that phase of the proposi-

ttion having been deferred until later.

So much has been said and written about the proposed tax that
any additional argument seems superﬂuous. l lowcvcr, we want
to point once more to the votes taken in the junior and Sopho-
more classes recently, both of whom were overwhelmingly in
favor of it. W'c are sure that the student assembly will deal
likewise with the proposition, which promises to revolutionize
conditions in the student body at Statc College. li'riday morn-
ing’s gathering will make State College history. lic present and
vote ” yes.”

MILITARY COMPANY AT STATE COLLEGE.

The action‘takcn by the men of State College last Friday morn-
ing. when a committee was appointed which is to take ‘tcps
leadingr to the establishment of a military company here. is in
keepingr with their standing as (20“ch mcn. Records show that
college men have always been among,r the lirst to rcspond to the
President’s call in time of need. For instance, it is known that
over twenty-three hiindrcd University of ll'cnnsylvania men took
part in the civil war. Again to-day. as another serious crisis is
threatening the peace and safety of our country, tlic collch men
are makingr the most determined demand for universal military
training. The men in all the universities, great and small, have
drawn a valuable lesson from the great war in Europe. They
are willing to sacriﬁce their lives for their ﬂag. demanding; at [be
same time, however, that they be not iisclcssly slaughtered by
nnprcparedness. They ask for the protection which training and
the guidance by trained ofﬁcers give. if ever they will have to
ﬁght they will have to ﬁght a trained cncniy. They have a right
to expect enough training,r before the battle to make the odds
even, man for man, when thc ﬁght begins.

College men are expecting Congress to act. T-licy arc expect—
inf,r Congress to pass an act providing for universal military
training. in the meantime. however. many colleges are takingr
the initiative. in that there are being;. formed among the students
military companies, designed to train them for active service.

The men of State College are proud of the part they are taking
in this movement. They are grateful for the chance that has
been promised them, which will enable them to do their bit if
the need arises. They hope for peace, but ifit is to be war they
will go in a body and ﬁght as (lid the men who left this institu-
tion a half century ago for southern battleﬁelds.

 

 

n,

We hope that the " Committee on a Military Company, lip<

. pointed last Friday, will, with the aid and advice of President

llrubachcr, be able soon to give us means to train.

 

Editor, State College News:

There are many things for which the student hotly of a college
is responsible. Its good sportsmanship often forms thc basis for
judgment from outsiders. is it not poor sportsmanship tor the
students to applaud at a basketball game when the opposing team
fails to score a foul? At the game with Hobart the poor spirit
of several S. C. T. students led them to cheer when a Hobart
man was ‘allcd out. The student, body as a whole undoubtedly
ilisapprovcs of such a demonstration. We hope that, during the
coming" baseball season. the general spirit of good sportsmanship
will prevent any student from cheering at. the hard luck of our
opponents. M. ll.
