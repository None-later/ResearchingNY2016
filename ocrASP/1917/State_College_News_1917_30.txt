legcs for the purpose of Work-
ing for the movement on its last

road to victory. This is the“

generation of sulfragettcs. The
way has been paved and work-
ing‘ for suffrage will soon be a
thing of the past. Ncw York is
the most inﬂuential State,
therefore it is important to win
New York. Miss Grant closed
her talk with 21. pl -a to the stu-

and that additional salaries of
from $400 to $800 are offered
regular teachers who are quali-
lied to train boys alou‘gr the lines
required. Also the speaker
praised the building-up powers
of the military training. he hav-
ing cxpcrit‘utced its beneﬁcial
effects upon ‘his own body while
with the State militia.

Alfred Miller ’19 then also
spoke in favor of the proposi—
tiou. The speaker said that
since it was he who had rc~
ccutly distributed the pamph-
lets of the "Collegiate Anti-
Militarism League" he was
glad to be able to speak now
for the other side. He cont--
pared the warring masses of
men in liurope with the in-
matcs of lunatic asylunms who
have broken out, and said this
country would have to be ready
to use force in order to prevent
those " wild men turned loose "
from disturbint‘r our peace.

Joseph A. Walker ’IS was the
last speaker. llc endorsed the
stand taken by the previous
speakers and added the wish
that State College might at
once go on record as favorith
military training and thus. fol~
lowingr the example of (."olgatc.
Cornell. )"litldlchury and other
colleges, be prepared to answer
the country’s call at any time.

Action was then taken and a
committee appointed by l’rcs.
linger consistingr of Vernon
('lule, .Tos. A. \\"'alker. and /\l-v
frcd Miller. This committee is
to take further steps leadiue;
toward the perfection of a mili-
lary organization at State Cob
lctre. Since all three members
are lunch interested, early re—
sults of their work are looked
for.

CONSUMERS’ LEAGUE
FOR SHORTER HOURS
FOR WAITRESSES.

The Consumers’ League of
S. C., as part of the National
organization, is busyiug itself
just now in an elTort to have
the hours shortened during
which women employees are
compelled to work in restart—
rants. .lx'estauraut workers are
the largest group of women
without the protection of the
law as far as hours are conv
corned.

l"i|‘ty~cight per cent. of wo-
men employed in such places
work cuch week beyond the 54
limit set by law for women in
stores and factories. While a
twelve hour day and a seven
day week is the lot of one—fifth
of the workers, a liftccn hour
day and a seven day week is not
at all uncommon.

'l'his overwork is a menace to
the public health. Lone; hours
mean the spread of infection by
those whose vitality is affected
and resistance lowered.

'I‘he Graves Restaurant bill,
the hearing on which was held
March (uh at Albany, asks that
the restaurant workers be given
the protection of the 9 hour day
and the :4. hour week on the
same basis as the store and
factory workers. Also that
they be not employed between
the hours of to p. m. and n a. m.
and that they shall have one
dav’s rest in seven.

'I‘wcnty-ouc States have pro-
tected their restaurant workers.
