STATE COLLEGE NEWS. MARCH 14. 1917

 

CHEMISTRY CLUB.

 

The Chemistry Club held its

regular bi-Weekly meeting. tiri—
(ln afternoon, March 9th. At
this meeting two new members
were elected, tMiss Bessie
Wood and Miss lflertha West.
Current topics were given by
Mr. Burns, Mr. Bronson. Miss
Daley and Miss llreen.
I Miss Mildred O’Maiiey read
a very interesting paper on
“Steel.” She said in part that
when man first turned to metals
our so~called civilization began.
We do not know why steel
hardens. Yet on this hardening
of steel one whole civilization
may be said to depend. l’ure
iron is almost a useless metal.
'Ilut add to it some carbon, with
or without one of the rarer
metals, and all its qualities
are immediately transformed.
Steel, then. may be defined as
an alloy of iron and carbon not
found in nature and of the
greatest industrial importance.
.liut important as carbon steel
has proved itself throughout
the past century, its alloys far
outrank it at the present time.
The chief of these are nickel
steel. manganese steel. chrome
steel, molydcnnm steel, and
tungsten steel. The qualities
sought in all these steels are
strength and hardness
ductility, and this they are,
without. a doubt, able to fur—
nish.

STATE COLLEGE GIRLS
TO AID THE RED CROSS.

At the chapel exercises, field
liriday mornin 3' for the girls of
the college. kliss Springs-steed
gave a talk on the work of the
Red Cruss Society. it is the
desire of the United States to
enlist one million members;
ten thousand of these to be re—
cruitcd by the Albany chapter.
A plan was suggested whereby
each student may enroll in any
or all of special classes to be
formed if the demand is stifli—
rictll to warrant it. These
classes will probably include:
A class for trainng in lirst aid
to the injured; second, a class
in the preparation of supplies
to be used in relief work; third,
a class in camp cookery.

The girls were urged to join
the Red Cross Society, The
dues, payable at Miss li’iercc’s

office. are only one dollar.
This does not obligate the

members to serve, but merely
shows their interest in the
furtheram-e of this work,

Miss I’icrce asked the girls to
be more courteous in their re~
lations to each other and care-
ful about the illlpt'CSsimlS made
upon visitors. Miss l’ierce de«
sires the cooperation of the
girls of the college in keeping
the conditions as pleasant and
sanitary as possible.
