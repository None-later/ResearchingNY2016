INDOOR TRACK MEET
FRIDAY.

Men Preparing for Annual
Struggle.

With the basketball season
closed and hasehall not yet
claiming attention, track ath-
letics 'have a good chance to
come into prominence. Al!
though little has been heard of
track activities yet. for a matter
of fact. a group of men have
been training" daily in prepara—
tion for the annual indoor track
meet, which will he held on
Friday evening. March 23d.
that is to say, the day after to"
morrow.

in former years the track
meets have never ctmnnandcd
much interest among the stu-
dents in general. and the girls
in particular were conspicuous
hy their absence. This year.
however. matters promise to
take a different turn. Coach
l’luhhard and Atlanag'er of
'I‘rack Futherland 'have ar-
ranged a set of events which
will hrine' out the hest material
in the college, liven in practice
keen rivalry has sprung up
among the men and added to
that is the fact that the meet
will he an interclass contest, as
well as one beween individuals.
On account of the unequal dis-
trihution of men amongr the
different classes. the men will
line up as representin the
combined ‘Henior and Sopho-
more classes on the one hand.
and the lunior and Freshmen
on the other. The l7-Io com-
bination is much the stronger
as far as numbers are con—
cerned. but the Juniors and
Freshmen claim that they make.
up in quality what they lack
in quantitv. if this is true, of
course. only the meet will tell.

SCHOOL jOURNALISM.

 

 

Paper. Read by James Wingatc,
Dist. Supt. of Schools, Schenec-
tady, N. Y., before Press Club
of the State College for Teach-
ers, March 17, 1917.

School journalism in the gen-
eral acceptatiou of the term is
usually applied to efforts out-
side of the school to circulate
educational information among
persons interested in the teach-
ing; profession through puhlica~

and art of teaching and to Cit"

from good to indifferent and

llut the school journalism
which we will attempt to dis-
cuss is something very differ—
ent. it relates to efforts inside
a particular school or institu-
tion, to make use of the printed
page, composed by memhcrs of
that particular school and cir-

PRESIDENT'S REPORT
SHOWS LACK OF
FUNDS.

Dr. A. R. Brubacher Points Out
That Efﬁciency of College
Is Threatened.

The failure of the State to ap-
propriate sufficient money an—
nually for the maintenance of
the State College for 'I'eachcrs
(threatens to seriously impair
its efficiency, President Dr. A.
l\’. llruhacher made known in
his annual report. The report
shows that the appropriation
has not kept pace with the
growth of the student hody and
the faculty, the amount appro-
priated per student fallingr from
$17; in ion} to $l2.t in 1917,
this figure representng from
one-half to onesuuartcr the ex-
penditure per student in other
colleges of the State. The difﬁ-
culty under which the collch
is lahoriue; is emphasized by
the assertion of Dr. llrubachcr.
that the normal capacity of the
present plant is approximately
500 students. while its enroll-

'ment for the year 1916 was 910

students, or almost twice its
capacity.

Following: discussions of con-
ditions, the report points to
certain well delindc needs.
