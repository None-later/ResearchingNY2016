N. ‘Y., before the Press Club last Friday afternoon.

Although

it is usually our practice to give but a brief account of a speech
of this kind, we lmd that the contents of Mr. \Vingatc's paper
are interesting and of such practical value that we deem it advis-

able to publish the text in its entirety.

We recommend its read-

ing to all students connected with the “ News,” the “ Echo ” and
the Press Club, as well as to others interestch in newspaper work.

 

S. C. ALUMNUS AUTHOR
OF INTERESTING BOOK.

Clarence A. \il’ood. an alum-
nus of the State College ior
Teachers, read a paper \Vcd—
ncsday, li‘ebruary 28. at Boston,
before the fourteenth annual
convention of the Religious
Education Association on Re;
ccnt Developments in the Cor-
relation of ltible Study with the
\IVork of the Public Schools.
The paper was based on infor-
mation which Mr. \‘Vood has
been collecting for more than a
your relative to the country—
wide movement to give credit
in public schools and colleges
for Bible study pursued in
Sunday schools, parochial
schools, vacation iliblc schools.
Y. M. and Y. W. C. A., etc. A
book embodying complete in-
formation about this significant
movement by Mr. Wood. en-
titled “School and College
Credit for Outside ’iiblc
Study" has just been pub-
lished. (Sec advertisement in
the April issue of the “ Echo")

The plan of correlating Bible
study pursued out of school or
college with the State systcm
of education was ﬁrst applied
in the State Teachers College
at Greeley, Colorado. in mm.
Prof. E. A. ICross. head of the
department of Literature and
English at that college. which
corresponds to the State Col—
lege for 'l‘cachcl‘s in this State,

 

wrote Mr. Wood. .li‘cbruary 9,
con ,crning the (.npcration of the
plan that “ it is accepted here
as a permanent success. and we
just cxpc 't 't to go on doing its
work. ()f the 232 who
enrolled in lots—16 one hundred
and live got college credit.
'I‘hcrc are enrolled this your
something more than 260.”

]t is interesting to note that
the plan was first adapth .to
high school sudcnts in the State
of North Dakota by a native of
Cortland. a graduate of the
Cortland Normal School, and
an instructor of Mr. Wood at
the Uncrmta Normal School.
Dr. Vernon P. Squires. now
Dch at the Univcrsity of
N-ort'h Dakota.

Dr. Squires wrote the intro-
duction to 41'. Wood’s book in
which he says, “Mr. Wood has
set forth with great care the
hintory of this rcnmrkal‘)lc
movement and its present
status. ‘ * i‘ it is fortunate
that hc has gathered up thus
early the facts which have at—
innrlml the inauguration of this
great educational movement on
the part of the church and the
now rcci'i'rnilir’m of thc valuc.
of Biblical and rcligicus train-
incr bv ilic educatime authori-
ties of our country."

The book cnablcs the reader
to get a hirdHcyO view of a na—
tional movement. There are
chapters telling whv lhc l‘dblc
should be studicd ' by school

children, and there are excel-
lent courses of Bible study
given to rether with very ad-
mirable ( irections as to the best
way to secure 'State or munici-
pal action.

Mr. Wood took A. B. from
the State College for Teachers
in i909. Pcd. ll. in Igio and
l’ed. M. last June. He also has
the degrees of lf’h. ii. and ll. D.
from thc University of Chicago,
Ph. M. from Syracuse Univers~
ity and LL. M. from the State
University of Maine and from
the University of Buffalo. He

COLLEGE M USICAL CLUB
ORGANIZED.

 

New Organization for the Music-
ally Inclined.

inst Dccctnbci', in English
IA, the desirability was dis—
cussed of having in this college
an organization for the purpose
of gathering together the
musically inclined. As an out-
come of that d' ussion the
colich Musical Club was
formed with about one-half of
that class as a nucleus. l‘iy
means of a small monthly as—
sessment a piano is being
routed. and intcrcsting iiifornml
meetings arc held in room in.
at 3:45 on alternate Mondays.

It is planned to have each
program consist of both lilcrv
ary and musical numbers, with
the emphasis strongly on the
musical. The cxccuiivc work.
arrangement of programs, and
other business is carried on
through committees. the organ-
ization being kept as simple as
will serve the purpose.

The society consists at pres—
ent of forty—two active mem—
bers. Every member must.
noon cnti'ancc. signify his wil-
lingness to pay the assessments
lor lhc piano, and to scrvc. on
the programs whenever called
upon. Names of candidates for
membership are submitted by
nicmbcrs of the club. together
with a statement of the kinds
of contribulions the candidates
are willing to make to the pro-
grams. The aim is not to have
only the accomplished. but
rather those. who are i‘cadv 10
do what they can. and will be
rongcnial members of the
group.

At the meeting of March it).
the program was:

Pcading— lsabcllo Johnston.

FRESHMEN PARTY.

The Freshmen party took on ‘
a different aspect this year than
ever before in that its members,
neither fellows nor rirls, were
evading the Sophs or fear of
abduction. , In former years
this annual event of the Fresh-
men’s first party has interested
the whole student body. Many
exciting stories might be told
of the strenudus rivalry which
has previously existed.

The gymnasium was well
decorated with evergreen
boughs, yellow roses and crepe
paper. The color scheme of
yellow and white was further
carried out in the yellow and
white ice cream served in
boxes bearing 1920 stamped on
the cover. and in the dance pro—
grams. i.)al"fodils wcrc prc~
sentcd to each one as they cu—
tcrcd the door.

An excellent program took
place during intermission.
Miss Amy Shelley sang “ ("far-
mcna," accompanied by Miss
Dorothy ilanncr. Miss lilor-
cncc Stubbs gave an interesting
reading from James Whitcomh
Riley's poems.

The committee in charge of
the dance consisted of the
Misses Jean Amos. Hazel Pear-
sall, Amy Shcllcy. Marian
Mason~ Dorothy ilanncr. Mar—
ion I’iaskins. and Elton ilukcs,
Ernest 'l‘ripp, Edward Spring~
man. lx‘hodcrick lllcssiug and
