STUDENTS FRIENDSHIP
FUND.

All this year throughout the
land a movement has been on
foot among American colleges
to show our sympathy for sin--

dents of Europe whose life, but V

a little while since, pleasant
and lovely as ours. has been
transferred from campuses to
prison camps. The Interna-
tional Y. Kl. C. A. has under-
taken the raising of a fund for
the aid of these prison camp
sufferers. Let this he under—
stood: The money is used in
the camps of both sides and the
necessities and supplies are, it
goes without saying, dis—
tributed to all persons alike.
On Friday. in Student Assem-
bly. Mr. Galloway, of New
York City, will present the
matter to State College stu-
dents. Let our response to him
be generous.
