The basketball season was
ﬁnally closed last 'l‘hnrsday
afternoon when the 'Ii‘reshmeu
took the Milne l’lig‘h School
live into camp, the score being

31 :23.

The ﬁrst hall of the game.
due perhaps to the absence of
Captain Springman, was very
close, the period ending with a
score of 11:10 in the college
men’s favor.

in the second half the lirosh,
with SpringIn-ann in the line—up,
had little trouble in running
away from the High School
boys. l'eckhatn featured the
game with several clever shots
from tho llt'ld. For the High
School boys Davidson, Axle—
road and \Vard were the stars.
