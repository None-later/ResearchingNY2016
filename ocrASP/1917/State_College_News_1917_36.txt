STATE COLLEGE VS.

Purple and Gold Nine to Play
Army Saturday
The State College baseball
season will open Saturday
when the team will travel to
\\7est l’oint to play the Army.
Inclement weather conditions
have so far kept the men from
playing outdoors so that it is
quite difﬁcult to say just who
will make the trip and in what

condition the team will be. it ,

stands to reason. however. that
the l'urple and (iold aggrega—
tion will be badly handicapped.
'If the. weather is favorable,
Coach llub‘hard will endeavor
to give. Captain tiioewey and his
team workouts at Ridge-field
one or two days before Satur—
day. There seems to be a lot
of material to pick from this
year, since almost all of last
year’s men are back and in ad-
dition Inany new faces are on
the squad. [1 is probalde that
the regular line-up will not be

CITIZENS 0R SOLDIERS
IN 1917?

Interesting Comparison of Wash-
ington and Wilson.

l’rofessor Risley showed
clearly in his recent speech in
chapel that although \\’ashing—
ton was distinctly " the
lighter." he too resolved to toi-

erate “such pulsillanimous di-
plomacy " in I704 as Wilson is
eritiri' l for tolerating in H)l7.

   

lint .\’lr. Risley pointed out also
that the United States in ll)l7
is not the infant republic of
I704, At that time '\\I’ashing-
ton in his anxiety for the wel—
fare of an unstable nation was
ready to choose the pen. to re-
pudiate the sword.

in comparing the policies of
\\"ashineton and \r\"ilson, l’ro—
fcssor Risley showed that con-
ditions in I794. when France
and [England were at war. were
much like those now; that then
lingland. by her blockath of
neutrals. ‘had placed the United
States in the same critical posi—
tion in defense of neutrals into
which Germany has forced us
to-day.

He gave the popular conclu—
sion, in comparing \'\".'Ishington
and \\"ilson. “ \\'ashington the
lighter. Wilson the writer:
\\'ashiugton the warrior. \\'il—
son the worrier." Is it just to
picture Wilson in the constant
attitude of one nroving the neu
mightier than the sword? is it
just to picture \Vasthington in

RED CROSS IN S. C. T.

 

The purpose. of the Red
t'ross Society is perhaps not
generally understood by the
students of State College. 'I‘hc
Red Cross is the sole agctu'y
directly commissioned by the
.\‘n1crican government for relief
to its sailors and soldiers in
time of war. In times of peace
it is one big dependable organis
zalion for prompt relief to com-
mIIn-ities overwhelmed by
floods. fires, famines. carth—
quakes or other (“ l'

The American Red tiross So-

should be willing to do their

(I3 girls had enrolled. That is
a very poor showing from the

the part of the 19I7—1919aggrc-
gation, yet it is a ' ' that the
number of first places were al-
most evenly divided among
both sides. The odd numbered
classes won the pole vault, the
broad jump, the relay race, and
the shot put, while the even
classes carried first place in the
high jump, the potato race, and
the I5 yard dash. The losers
wcre handicapped in that: they
did not have enough men com—

to yield many second, third,
