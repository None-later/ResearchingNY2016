't‘h: act of li‘cbrnary 3, 1917. is
next door to action ; it unites an

l’rt’rfessor Itisley quoted
freely from the farewell addre

off when we may defy material

,injury from external annoy-

ance; when we may take such
an attitude as will cause the
neutrality we may at any time
resolve upon to be scrupulously

making acquisitions upon us

may choose peace or war. as our
interest: guided ‘by justice. shall

We listen to these words as
from a prophet. a man of sound
judgment who is stating pnlill‘

'l‘hey have been wisely con—

against a necessary unavoidable
war. in fact. it is expected;
nothing against preparedness.
rather it is urged; nothingr

liance at least temporary. if the

 

interest of harmony and liberal
intercourse should, in the mid-
ance of the present or o the
future demand such an alliance.
If the maintenance of peace, in
our best judgment, should call
for a League of Peace, the fare—
wcll address would sanction it;
yet our judgment. should form
slowly, surely, since no better
deterrent: than the present war
is needed to keep us out of
European disputes.

in order to train the children of
the country into true manly
patriotism, she must he placed
on the same level of citizenship
with man. The key to the
whole situation is to give. her
the right to vote. The l'resi-
dent urges the women of the
College to become interested in
the question and in order to
organize this interest. he gave
permission to the suffrne'ists
present to form a club. He.
places but one restriction on
the organization. and this was a
restriction which met with up—

SCHOOLEBURNALISM.

 

Paper Read by James Wiugatc.
Dist. Supt. of Schools. Schenec-
tady, N. Y., before Press Club
of the State College for Teach-
ers, March 17,1917.

(Continued from last issue.)

Since functioning is such an
important part of our school
effort 10-day. we may well ask
ourselves what is the function
of a school journal of the type
that we will discuss? I take it
that among; the functions of
such a paper. the followingr
may be denominated: (1) To
disseminate news; (2) to stinnr
late and strengthen a whole-
some. college or school spirit,
without which no institution
can be successful; (3) to moti»
vate or furnish an incentive to
students for making practical
application of English training;

(4) to stimulate an interest in

the broader subject of general

journalism; (5) to develop
business efficiency lllTlt'mg its
publishers. '

in order to successfully put..-
lish such a paper it is necessary
to have. an efﬁcient organiza-
tion. in modern jmirnalism.
the. day when individual eftort

could successfully publish a

newspaper has gone by. and it

is everywhere recognized that

a modern successful newspaper

can only be 111aintained and

re ‘l'l its highest degree of
efﬁciency throueh combined
and cooperative effort. There-
fore. it might in well for 11s to

study the organization of a

modern newspaper and make

some comparisons with a

school paper. Most of our

laree and modern papers are
to-~dav owned by ,e'roups of in»-
dividuals tirnanized into a cor-
poration. in this cruincction
the college or institution itself
should stand in the same posi—
tion to the school paper as the
controlline‘ or owniurr corpora~
t'ion does to a Q‘t'Ctll‘ dailv. The
functions of the two are very

 

similar. namelv. to educate.‘

elevate and to exercise a whole-

 

some inﬂuencr: upon mankind
in general and upon the cons
stitucncy to whicheach appeals
in particular. The corporation
publishing a newspaper has
hundreds of thousands of dol-
lars, possibly millions invested
in its plant and equipment.
The college or institution has
similar amounts invested in its
plant and equipment, while not
particularly maintained for the
publication of a journal, yet,
nevertheless, such publication
would vim impossible without
the college plant. The corpo—
ration controlling a great daily
operates with the hope of ﬁnan-
cial reward. The college or in-
stitutional paper should operate
with the hope of a reward that
cannot be measured by the dol-
lar sign.
Continued next issue.

'l‘herc will be a meeting; of
the l’ronu-tlu-au literary So—
ciety this 'l.‘l1ursday eveuiue,r at
