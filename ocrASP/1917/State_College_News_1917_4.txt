made by Heason and a vote
taken showed that the student-
bndy was unanimously in favor
of the new proposition. When
the meeting was adjourned by
President Hager the Freshmen,
for the first time in the history
of the college, remained seated
until all upper classmeu had left
the auditorium.

 

1\ short lull and the battle

already intense excitement.
Niagara slowly forged ahead.
though still behind. Then came
the dreaded blow. lones. cap-
tain. and half of the powerful
back ﬁeld was taken out of the
game because of four persmtal
fouls committed. The team
was materially weakened. l’eck—
ham was substituted. but all
feeling of conﬁdence seemed to
have been taken from our men
with the removal of Jones.

Niagara tied the score; l>cd~
lam broke lose. The; garnered
another basket. then still an»-

hoped. l‘eckham shot a clean
basket. The roof was near fall--
lug. Little Fitz had to leave
the game; llohaus took his
place. Again team work was
interrupted. Niagara tallied
another tield goal; they were
four points ahead. 'l‘hcn Fitz

CLOSE SCORE.

The State College live. met
with defeat at the hands of the
St. Lawrence quintet in a very
fast and exciting game played on
Wednesday evening, l,)ec,ember
goth. in the Albany High School
gymnasium. it was the third
game of the season and the third
defeat for the l’urplc and (told.
This. however. is by no means a
disgrace nor should it be a dis-
appointment lo anybody. for it
must be considered that three of
the strongest teams in the State
have been met. The game with
St. Lawrence brought hope to
all close observers of the game.
for a decided improvement in
the work of the team could be
noticed. tToaclt \\‘achter tried
different combinations. He
started the game with l’ecldtam
at center and (ioewcy at forward
and S. Fitzgerald in a guard
position. Later lioewey played
center with S. Fitzgerald as a
forward and Miller as guard.
Later. when S. lt'itzgerald was
taken out on account of four
personal fouls which he had
commillt'd. (loewey again shifted
to forward and Springmann was
given a chance at center. in the
last few minutes of play lloltans
went into the game as forward
in F. Fitzgerald's place. of all
these combinations, the second
one. with the two Fitzgeralds as
forwards. (ioewcy at center. and
_lones and Miller as guards.
seemed to work best.

The score:

St. Lawrence.
