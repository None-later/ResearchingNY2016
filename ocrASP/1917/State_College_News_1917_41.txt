nasr Stooge]~ COUNCIL

Appointed by Faculty Committee
From Among Seniors

/\t the general meeting of all
students gathered in student
assembly last Friday moining,
the first student council in the
history of State College was
called into being. For months
a faculty committee had the
plan under consideration and
the action taken on Friday last
was the result of their labor.

STATE COLLEGE LOSES
TO ARMY.

West Point Wins by 15:0 Score.

The State College baseball
team opened its season at West
l'oint on March 31 with a de—
feat at the hands of the Army
by a score of 15:0. While the
score truly indicates superior-
ity on the part of the cadets.
yet it must not he understood
to interpret great weakness of
the State College team. While
the Purple and (iold men were
outclassed, this was due
mostly to the lack of practice
on their part as the early sea-
son and the consequent in-
clemency of the weather made
outdoor practice an impossi—
bility. This was noticeable in
the erratic playing of the men
who made more errors in that
one game than they probably
will in all the remaining games
combined.

The game opened with
\Voolever catching and Case
on the mound. However. the
latter was unable to locate the
plate and as a result of a few
minutes’ work four men were
passed. a batter hit. and a balk
committed. so that three runs
were scored by the cadets
without the use of the bat.

box and the affair began to

been taken and that a body of
Seniors had been selected to
take charge of the duties of a
council. The year is advanced
and limited time will hinder
this council from doing much.
yet the work it will do will be
very important. as it will lay
the foundation upon which the
work of all succeedng councils
will be built.

Dr. Hastings then spoke in
behalf of the faculty commit-
