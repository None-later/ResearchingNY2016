tice was to blame, Unly three
hits were gathered from the
delivery of the two pitchers the

his credit. the other going to

senooi. JOERNALISM.

 

Paper Read by James Wingate,
Dist. Supt. of Schools, Schenec»
tady, N. Y., before Press Club
of the State College for Teach‘
ers, March 17, 1917.

(Continued from last issue.)

Next down the scale of a
newspaper organization comes
the general manager. somcr
times known as the l'msiness
editor. He is a man who has
usually come up through the
ranks from possibly a cub re-
porter to city editor, sporting
editor. editorial writer, and so
on. In other words. he has
had experience in many of the
departments, and he brings to
his position a special knowl-
edge of many different depart-
ments aml a broad general
knmvlcdge on the whole sub—
ject of journalism. He has
been in close touch with the
constituency which the paper
strives to serve. It would,
therefore, seem that the mana~
ger of a college paper should
have warned that position
through promotion in the vari-
ous departments of the paper
and not because he is popular
or belongs to this or that so-
ciety or fraternity. This would
also seem to make it necessary
that; such manager should be
taken from the senior or possi~
blv from the iunior class and
that he should have shown
e‘recutive ability in the par—
ticular line of school iournal—
ism as well as nerhaos in other
student activities. He must be

you’re absolutely the-

 

a person who is able to get
along well with his associates,
arouse enthusiasm for the work
and inspire confidence; one
who realizes that in order to
make the paper successful it
must be made worth while, and
one who does not depend upon

'the loyalty of the students, the

alumni or the friends of the
college for the success of the
paper, but who starts out with
the proposition. “ I will make
the paper worth while and then
it must be successful.”
Another essential part of a
modern journal’s organization
is the news department. Tobe
successful. a daily paper must
be what its name implies, “
Newspaper.” The news de-
partment of every paper main—
tains a rcpcrtorial or “news
gathering” staff of considera—
ble size. The members of this
staff reach out in every line of
human activity for sources of
news. They circulate person-
ally in their own city among
the different departments of
city and county government.
