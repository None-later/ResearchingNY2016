CHEMISTRY CLUB.

Flag Presented — Picnic Planned —
Final Talk by Prof. Bronson.
‘The Chemistry Club held its
regular bi—weekly meeting on
Friday, April 27th. at 3:45
o’clock. Mr. Kennedy pre—
sented the club with a flag,
which was unveiled at this
meetingr and enthusiastically re—
ceived. This flag will remain
in the Chemistry lecture room

for the duration of the war.

The annual picnic. will be
held on Saturday, May IBlll. at
Miss (iauger‘s home in ('iilder-
land Center. At this nu-eting
ofﬁcers for the coming year will
be nominated. A nominating
committee composed of Miss
l’ost. Miss ()‘uVlallcy and Mr.
Fraser. was appointed by the
President.

Professor llronson gave the
final talk of the year on the
" Constitution of Matter." He
said that this subject has been
a matter of interest from the
earliest times. The earliest
theories were largely spccnlw
tion. but in the last twenty
years. since the discovery of
the X~l{ay, great developments
have been made in solving this
question. Formerly it was be
lieved that the atom was the
smallest particle of which inat-
tcr was rotltpost'tl. lint now We
know that there are still smaller
particles. one of which has one
seventeen hundredth of the
mass of one particle of hydro
gen. Also it has been discov~
cred that the mass of these pars
licles is variable and depends
upon the velocity or lllt' rate at
which the particle is movinv'
it is evident that many of 1w"
theories must be changed.
Especially the old theory of
valency must he done away
with.
LECTURE ON MISTAKES
OF PRACTICE TEACHER.

 

At a recent meeting of the
industrial Organization. Mr.
li‘ink. l’)irector of industrial
Arts in K‘chencctzuly. delivered
a splendid lecture on the " |n~
itial Mistakes oi the l‘ractice
Teacher." He said that the
greatest trouble teachers have
when going through their first
practice experiences is the
lack of conﬁdence. He also
mentions the fact that sympa-
thetic coordination with the
faculty brings success. He
urged all the practice teachers
to “ mix " with the students as
well as with the faculty. He
added that bv ioiniu': in social
functions and takine‘ an active
part in athletic activities. a sure
success is possible. He con-
cluded by saving that “Mis—
takes are costly. but neverthe—
less they are necessary toward
buildingr up success."

NEWMAN CLUB.

RevcrcndWilliam R. Charles
gave the second of his lectures
on ethics in St. Patrick’s Insti-
tute, i\l'(mday night, before the
Newman Club of State Col-
lege. His subject was " The Ra—
tional and Supernatural Basis
of Ethics." [father Charles
pointed out the fact that the
peoples who founded their
ethics chiefly on intellectual de—
velopment and untrammelcd
will, found their system in col—
lapse. and pointed as an exam-
ple to the Egyptians, the
(lrceks. and the tlx’omans.

I'revious to the Christian era,
man benefited mankind for his
own good. but with the advent
of Christianity man learned to
aid mankind in obedience to a
higher command. The lecturer
said that Christianity made a
life of unselfish service possi-
ble. in speaking of Christ as
a teacher. Father Charles made
a distinction between the
method of the Nazarene and
that of other teachers. the Mas-
ter showingr men their great—
ness by pointing out their er—
rors. while the other teachers
appealed to men’s pride and
their intellect.

SCHOOL JOURNALISM.

 

Paper Read by James Wingate,
Dist. Supt. of Schools. Schenec-
tady. N. Y., before Press Club
of the State College for Teach—
ers. March I7, 1917.

(Continued from last issue.)
They have special rern‘csenta—
lives at the seat of the State
and National governnn-nt. .\'o
locality is to small to escape its
notice. Where reporters can»
not personally cover the field.
stations are de 'gnatcd in
schools, news rooms. cigar
stores. etc., where all news
items of interest to the. eonr
munity may he left. Your
whole student body udder a

 

number of competent leaders ’

should be upon your repertorial
staff. 'l‘hey should interview
for news the heads of your
college departments, of your
fraternities and scan your ex-
changes. So many items of
news should be presented to
the news editor previous to
each issue that it would be pos—
sible to publish only a small
part of it. The news editor
could therefore. make his linal
selections as to what is really
the most vital news and. there—
fore, what should he published.
The reading public to—dtay are
more alert than ever and de-
mand the best quality in a
newspaper. No successful
newspaper reaches an ideal to-
day whieh should he the ideal
of to—morrow. More news.
trrcatcr variety of it. clearly
and comprehensibly written.

 

 

well and carefully edited with-
outbias toward anyone, is the
order of the day in newspapeh
dom. Here is a great ﬁeld for
the application of English
training in order that you may
boil down and clearly and con-
cisely express the news you
aini to publish.

To-day long items of news
are uninteresting to the aver—
age reader. People do not care
for long articles of ordinary
news. They want brief arti-
cles. more of them, with snappy
headings. This is also true of
the readers whom your paper
would serve. My general
criticism of the ordinary col-
lege paper is that it does not
contain enough small news and
that such small news is
grouped in a column or two
without proper headings. Your
readers. your students and
alumni demand that you make
your paper attractive to the
eye. Glance over a modern
daily and you will find that the
headlines frequently occupy as
much or more space than the
news itself. This is done for
two reasons, ﬁrst, to attract the
attention of the reader. for if
you do not do this your news is
of no value. and second. to give
him an opportunity to select
the news that is of inniortanee
to him and that he thinks is
worth while for him to read.
