LECTUREION ST. THOMAS
AQUINA

The Newman Club met at St.
Patrick‘s Institute Monday night
to hear lt‘athcr ()‘Urien lecture
on St. Thomas Aquinas. 'l'be
lecturer treated the subject in a
way that never fails to interest.
by telling incidents in the life of
the Saint. In discussing the
works of the Saint, Father
()‘llrien drew attention to that
part of the “ Summit 'l'heologia "
which treats of war, and showed
that America's entrance into the
war with (iermany is justified
when we apply the tests of
’l‘homas: (I) The sanction of the
lawful autlmrity; (a) The jus-
tice of the cause: (3) 'l‘he right-
eousness of intention.

SCHOOL JOURNALISM.
Paper Read by James Wingare.

Dist. Supt. of Schools. Schenec—

tady. N. Y., before Press Club

of the State College for Teach—

ers. March 17, 1917.

(Continued from last issue.)
You can scarcely carry this
item of attractive headlines to
the extreme. (lly attractive
headlines. I do not mean the
mammoth sensational headlines
as seen in some types of daily
journalsf) You waste paper by
not interesting the readers. bv
filling up your columns with
tong—winded accounts. 'I‘hcn.
too. a greater variety of news
means that you interest a

 

greater number of people.
which logically means more
readers. I. regard this as one
of the most important facts in
connection with the publication
of a paper, either school or a
modern daily. You :annot err
in this direction for if you give
gr ‘ttlet‘ variety you are bound
to attract and please more
readers and make the paper
more influential. ‘Mittlvc the
paper fairly sparkle with lit.th
stuff.

(the of the greatest essentials
in a reporter or news ga-therer
which must not be overlooked.
is that he must get the facts.
This is the tirst requisite. He
must get them accurately and
ext“ s them so clearly that
there can be no mismulersttuul-
ing of those facts. livery day
reporters call at our ofﬁce and
l have been much interested in
the impressions that these dif»
ferent individuals make tlpon
me. Some inspire contidence in
me and lead me to talk freely
to them about anything of im-
portance that transpires in my
own department or any matter
of news that l might know
about outside of my depart~
tnent. In fact. they make me
feel like racking my mind to
think of something that would
make a good news item or
story as they call it. Uthcrs
seem to irritate one. to make
one more reserved in his couv
versation with them. i believe
this difference comes from the
fact that one can be sure that
the former will truly and ac—
curately report. and that the
latter may be expected to
iumble the ,account. 'l‘herev
fore. let me again say to those
who are interested in this p:tr~
ticular division that you should
get the. facts and accurately
and truly express them. When
vou interview your president.
the heads of departments. your
trustees or anyone whom we
might term a source of news of
interest to the college. you
should inspire such persons
with conﬁdence in you. If you
are told that a certain thing
will lmppen in the near future.
but that it is not yet time to
publish that fact, you should
not- violate that conﬁdence
either orally to your associates
or through your printed page.

  

Another essential in a re-
porter is the follow-up work.
:\ paper reports many items of
news about events that ,are
going to happen and it is absrr
luter essential that an account
be given after the thing has
actually happened. When you
have mentioned in one issue
that some event will'trauspire
or smnctbing' will occur in the
future. the reader has a right to
expect that he will be given an
opportunity to follow that

 

event through to its conclusion
or consummation.

l. have spoken somewhat at
length upon this matter of
news, because I, regard it as the
most essential feature of a col-
lege or any other paper. In the
Field of school journals pub-
lished outside of institutions
and affecting the teaching pro-
fession generally. l am sure
that I. am right in saying that
got/t.» of the readers will turn
ﬁrst of all to the news column.
If I might mention individual
papers, I would say that this
particular feature. the news de~
partment. has made the School
llnllctin, published at Syracuse.
attractive to its readers. Some
y'ars ago i was for a short
time acting editor of American
Education. and during that
time | established a county
news department covering the
counties of this State. and know
that no division of that paper
was read bv more people than
this particular department.
