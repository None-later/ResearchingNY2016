MYSKANIA.

 

This issue of the News"
offers a last opportunity to set
before thwsttulculs the purpose
of Myskania. it is especially
lilting to do this here, because
the past year has brought us,
with many other advantages,
Myskania.

For the heuelit of the alumni.
we Would say that .\lyskauia is
an honorary student Council
consisting of not more than
twelve or less than ten mem—
liet‘s‘. live of whom are chosen
by the faculty and the rest by
the retiring council. The pur—
pose of .\’lyskauia is to regulate
student activities such as class
and college elections, sorority
and fraternity matters, certain
athletic questions, and other in—
terests of the same kiml.

Many other colleges have
bodies of this sort. and we feel
that the organization of Mys-
kania is a decided step forward
in our college life.

 

COLLEGE CLUB.

The meeting of 'Collcge Clu’h
on Friday, May lh’th, which
was the last meeting of the
year. was particularly interest-
ing. Dr. Wyer. State Librar-
ian, spoke and read about
literature of the war. Dr.
Wyer said that war fills our
minds now. and for some time
to come. it thrills the mind of
the poet and gives him inspira-
tion for what is called “war
literature." Unfortunately,

though, only a little of this

 

 

 

work will stand the test of
years.

Dr. \\'yer read some oi the
hest of the war poems, written
during the present struggle:
“The Foldier." thy Rupert
llrooks; ".-\ugust, l9l4,” hy
John .\'faselie|d, and “Search—
ligltts," thy Alfred Noyes.

Itr. -.\lyer. then spoke of the
relation and attitude of French
canadians to the present war.
and read several poems in the
charming tfzut-arlian dialect,
