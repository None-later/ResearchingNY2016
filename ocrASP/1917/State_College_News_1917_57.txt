SCHOOL JOURNALISM.
Paper Read by ames Wingate.
Dist. Supt. of chools, Schenec-
tady, N. Y., before Press Club
of the State College for Teach-
ers, March 17, 1917.
(Continued iroin last issue.)

Another departlnent in the
organization of a modern news-
paper is the editorial depart-
ment. Nmnerically speaking,
this department has fewer em~
ployees than the news depart
ment: and, comparatively, it is
of less importance. The edi-
torial demands an entirely dif—
ferent style of writing. lt
should be less factual. taking a
particular subject and using a
few basal facts, making an ap—
peal to the reason with the aim
of influencing the reader to
r 'hnthe conclusion you would
have him reach through your
discussion of the few facts.
Your conclusions should not be
definitely stated in the edito«
rial. You mu give the reader
credit for sufficient inte genee
to reach the conclusion that
you would have him reach
through your editorial discus»
sion. The editorial should be
free from personal bias. its
subject should be treated in a
broad general way. in this de-
partment. as in the news dc—
p‘artmcnt. the reading public no
longer tolerates long-winded
articl . in fact. in general
newspaperdtun. the editorial
has declined in influence. The
time was when the \\'eekly
Tribune. the Toledo lilade
and other papers of their class
exerted through their editorial
columns. a powerful influence
in molding public. opinion.
lint to—day the reader desires
to form his own conclusion
after reading the news items.
Of course we must admit that
we have not the powerful
editorial writers to~day that the
preceeding generation had.
(ii‘eely. Weed aml Dana were
strong and potent writers.
and l know of no editorial
writers to-day that can be com-
pa'ed with thcln. Their in—
fluence was personal through
their own editorials. int
times have changed. and the in—
fluence of a paper to-(lay is im—
personal. lcaving its readers to
think and conclude for them-
selves thrt'xugh the fairness of
the general news. ‘nther than
throuin the editorials of an in—
dividual. ’l‘ihe editorials. there—
fore, in each issue should be
short and few in number. I
would suggest that a good way
to stimulate interest in your
paper would be to have one
signed editorial in each issue
written by a person interested
in the college and generally
known to the readers of your
paper. For instance. I would
suggest that one issue contain

 

 

   

 

 

a short editorial over the sig-
nature of your efficient presi-
dent, another over the signa—
ture of the Commissioner of
lCdncatitm. of your dean, of the
heads of departments, of the as—
sistant commissioners of edu-
‘ation in the State. You might
even persuc this further and
secure a short signed editorial
froln persons prominent in the
State government. There
should be no difﬁculty in secur—
ing signed editorials that would
be worth while for each liltin—
her. This would prove. in my
judgment. an attractive and
valuable feature of a school
paper and the reader upon rc-
ceipt of his paper Would turn
at once to see who had written
the l 'ading signed editorial aml
would desire to know the sub-
stance of it.

The condition of the financial
affairs of any [gr-at daily de~
pends largely upon the etli~
cienry of its advertising depart-
ment. No newspaper fo-day
could continue to exist without
the income derived from ad»
verlising. This is a legitimate
field of service fo' a newspaper,
a service which brings the
buyer in touch with the seller.
So. too. any school journal or
newspape ‘hould see to it that
its advertising department is
Well organized, 1\ school paper
would. therefore, do well to
hav ‘ an advertising dcparfment
presided over by an advertis-
ing manager. He should have
the assistance of several of his
colleagues. There are many
firms and merchants whose
business it is to sell goods that
your college needs. in the line.
of books. equipment, pictures
and appa ‘atus; goods that your
students need in the line of
wearing apparel, banners. pins.
school supplies. etc. There is
a large. variety of needs and
your appeal could be made to a
large number of advertisers.
in soliciting your advertising.
do not make the mistake of ask—
ing for it out of sympathy. giv—
ing as a reason that your paper
is not a paying oroposition.
that the. advertiser ought to
help the college. and various
other sympathetic appeals, No
person to-dav does business on
svmpathv. It is a plain busi-
ness proposition. Convince
vour advertisers that it will pav
them to adverfiSP with you and
if you can make if pay them to
do so there will be no doubt
about vour Wettian the busi—
ness. i recall heinn' with a ref)-
resenfafive of a school paper
when he solicited advertising
irom the manager of a lame
tmok company. To oresentincr
hi: prnooqition the solicitor
made this remark. " You know.
Mr. Rlank. that our n‘aoer is
not a paying proposition. that

 

 

ny work is largely a labor of

I
love.” The advertising man—

ager of the book firm steed up,
presented his hand and said,
" The Lord bless you. I have
been laboring for love all my
life. We will exchange compli-
ments and :ancel any obliga-
tions,” and he bid the solicitor
good day. The appeal was
wrong for the very reason that

have indicated above. He
should have said. " Our paper
r :aches a large number of
readers who buy your goods.
it will pay your firm to'plaec
an add in our paper, and .I. will
show you how it pays.” Your
advertising manager should
s‘an your exchanges and other
school papers. Make out a list
of the names of firms and mer~
chants who advertise in other
papers. .l'lace on your list the
firms and merchants in your
city whom your student body.
your faculty and the college
officers patronize. You should
never be satisfied with the
amount of advertising you
have. but should strive to in~
crease it in the next issue. The
more you can show in your
paper the more easy will it be
to secure additional adver ‘
ing. Sue s brings more sne-
eess. This particular depart—
ment should be an excellent
field for business training. You
will ,e meeting,r lmsiness men.
You will learn how to approach
them upon a ‘lmsiness proposi-
tion and you will get much en—
joyment from making this de~
pai‘tment more and more suc-
cessful.

The circulation department
is another important depart—
ment of a successful daily
paper. It is relatively import—
ant for a successful school
paper. Here is another field
for m‘ganization and business
efﬁciency and many plans may
be formulated which would in—
crease your circulation. For a
school paper it is fundamental
that a large percentage of the
student body subscribe to your
paper. This is a field for per—
