sonal canvass. It is important
not only to the success of the
paper, but to the success and
growth of the college itself that

'a large percentage of the

alumni subscribe to the paper.
This fact should be impressed
upon the various senior classes
as they are about to leave the
college and join the ranks of
the alumni. Your appeal to
the large body of alumni, how—
ever, must necessarily be made
through correspondence and
the sending of sample copies.
This is another field for busi-
ness management and for the
application of your knowledge
of successful business corre¥
spondcncc. Your letters to the
alumni should not be ordinary.
There should be some feature
about each letter which will at-
tract the attention and make
its recipient feel that it is his
duty both to himself and the
college to subscribe to the
paper.

Advertisers demand circula—
tion. Your school paper he—
comes of more value to each
subscriber as its circulation in!
creases.

There is another valuable
feature of school journalism
which should not be overlooked
in any discussion of this sub-
ject. Your press committee
should see to it that the various
daily papers. at least those
published in the Capital Dis—
trict, as well as the great New
York dailies receive news items
regularly. These items should
be well written and in a style
and manner that would be ac-
ceptable by such papers with—'
out further editing. Here
again they should be short,
clear and concise. Another
ﬁeld for the application of your
English training and perhaps a
ﬁeld for another department in
your organization. This would
prove a valuable means of
keeping,r your college and its
work before the public through
the medium of the daily news-
papers. ’ .

I have attempted to outline
to you in this discussion the
organiiation of a successful
daily newspaper and to point
out to you that the same organ-
ization is applicable to a school
paper. if you will organize
your work of publishing a
school journal along the lines
indicated, I feel conﬁdent that
vnu will produce a paper that
will vitally function in the life
of the institution and approach
the aims indicated in the be-
ginning,r of this paper. namely:
you will disseminate news. at-
tractively, clearly and concisely
written which will appeal to
your circulation; you will
stimulaﬁ: and strengthen a
wholesome college spirit; you
will develop an enthusiasm for
the college and an interest in

all of its varied activities that

may reach even beyond your
loudest hopes; you will furnish
an opportunity for a’large
number of students to make
practical application of their
English training; you will
stimulate an interest in the
fascinating subject of general
journalism, and with it all you
will be giving courses in busi-
ness and business administra-

tion which can not help but

equal in interetr and in value
any formal course in busmess
administration.
