()wing to the snow and rain of
the last few weeks, which was
followed by a warm spell, the
hockey squad was unahle to use
the new skating,r rink. l‘racticc
was held during this time itt the
gym and an unusually large num~
her joined the squad fora tryout.

last Saturday afternoon, how—
ever, the ringr being in fairly
good condition, the squad began
us outdoor work. 'l‘here were
enough nten present for two
teams and a lively practice game
and stiff workout showed that
the indoor training of the men
had proven a success. Coach
Iluh'hard expressed his approval
of the way itt which the squad
handed themselves on the ice.
The defense trio. consisting,r of
the l.ol:dell brothers and led—
tnan. was on the job. astrl few
plays riteseeded in piercing their
line.

On t'atnrday. Jan. 13. the
hockcv squad went to Troy
and played the lx‘. l’. l. varsity.

great hope for the establishment
of hockey as one of our major
winter sports. as we have all the
prerequisites necessary for its
success in the future.

reserve three dates in your en—
gagement hook. liehruary Ist,

mid—years will he over then,
and you will welcome the
chance to recreate yourself.

Junior week! We have
heard about it ever since we
first cattle to S. t‘. 'l‘.. and we
have heen told. “ You will only
he Juniors once, so remem-
bcr'.” Now that we are
juniors let us say that. while
we have enjoyed the process of
development immensely, we
have no desire to evince our
devotion to our 'College by re—
maining‘ juniors for another
year. So let the slogan be
“ now or never." but let’s leave
the “ never " off.

The Junior reception will
take place in the gym. 'l‘hurs-

their banquet was not exactly
as successful as their l’rom.

that contention. On top of
those experiences now comes
the northern trip with uu‘
precedenth “ hard luck.”
Clarkson Tech Wins, 41:27.

The team left Friday morn-
ing. January 12th, for l’ots-
dam. This village is situated
in the far north of the State
and the men were on the road
from six«thirty in the morning
until about five at night. After
these ten hours of continuous
travel the men were iii no
shape to play. When they
took the floor against the
Clarkson Tech live they
seemed to have lost all life and
"pep." to use the technical
term. The game was very
rough. The umpire. though
impartial. was very lax. and
this gave the (lat *m men a
decided advantage. since they
were much heavie‘ and hotter '
accustoli to the r(itl§.{lt,Stle
of game. Nevertheless. the
State College men held their
opponents even in the first half,
after which the Tech men drew
away. liy half time they led
with a score only 22:t7. in
the second half the Purple and
Gold rapidly fell behind. Cap:
tain Jones was about the only
man to play up to the usual
standard. He played an ex—
cellent ﬂoor game throughout
and scored three baskets from
the field. The contest ended
with a score of at :27 in Clark-
son's favor. This score is a
much better one than that of
last year. when State College
lost 48:16. The score:
