however, therefore, the follow-
ing:

;\|'ter graduating front the.
Albany l'ligh School in 1012,
.‘ l’utterer spent four very
sue 'siul years with usw
years in which she did as much
for the college as the college
did'lor her. She \‘tIH al\'ays
(frIlt‘t‘llely prmuiueut wherever
her skill in writing. singing or
actiu'r was needed. She, was

‘ reporter her sccottd ye: ,

.dent of l’rontethean her
third year and editor of the
licho her fourth. She took part
in'the operetta and the lit-ho
play each year. Many of us

She comes here now, par-
ticularly well equipped for her
work havng studied both
winte‘ and snmmc~ at it'Ttilnm-

RESIGNATION UT? MISS

EDNA I. AVERY

Miss lidna l. .\vcry, who has
been instittctor in Domestic
.\rt at State College since 1013,
has resigned her position here
in order to accept a place in the

 

l'niversity of Cincinnati. Her

what she has been doing here.

Mary A. McClelland

Mary Anna McClelland is in
her forty—eighth year of cott-
tinuous service at the State
College for Teachers, Miss
McClelland was appointed
teacher of English and history
in 1861), and has been a mem-
ber of the regular teaching
faculty since that time.

TO THE STUDENTS:

l have been asked by the edi-
tor of the “News” to say a
word of greeting in these col-
utnns to the students of the
College. All summer long I
have been conscious that my
mere paper acquaintance with
you is very inadequate. The
records of upper classmen and
the credentials of new students
have been much in my mind in
recent weeks. The immediate
prospect of making the per-
sonal acquaintance of every
student is doublv gratifying to
me at this time. People are
more interesting than records
and personal interviews more
satisfactory than correspond—
ence. I have found pleasure
and interest during the summer
in the paper approach to the
work before me, but I am glad
the college year is opening and
:011 are comind. Empty col-
lege halls, l must: confess, do
not much inspire me.

'[ am quite serious in the (le-
sire to know personally and to
be of some possible service to
every student in the College.
I shall be much itt need of your
help in realizing that ambition.
I shall plan to be in my ofﬁce
every week-day morning ex—
cept Saturday from 10 to 12
o'clock. and shall be happy to
see students at other hours by
aimintment. We enter upon a
year which is inevitably to be
oi great moment in the history
«11' our country and of the
\vorld. We. can all do our
" bit ". in part at least, by mak—
ing the year’s college Work
thoroughly productive.

\\’ith kindly greetings and
very best wishes to all. I am

Lfordially and sincerely

yours.

llarlan Hoyt llorncr.
