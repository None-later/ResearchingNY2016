A WORD OF WELCOME

There are no moments of our life which bring more happiness
than those spent with friends, in forming new friendships or in
renewnig of old ones. For this reason the opening days of

Colic re are milestones in a student’s life never to be fiil“"t)l:tcll.
. h I

The warmth and sincerity of the welcomes lilis one with an' iii-
explicaiile joy, which can be gained nowhere else.

At this time the. " News " claims a share in the rejoicing”
and extends to the lfaculty and to each and every student a most
hearty welcome. \ e have assembled here under circumstances
which are entirely dill rent than those marking other semesters.
With our country at var, it is quite natu all that the edu :ational
institutions should be the first to be affected. State College,
however, continues on its way, increasing its educational service
to meet the new demands with the noble aim of increasing the
student’s availability for national service. This should be your
aim also.

At-nu time has the college student body distinguished itself
as in this recent gr'at military undertaking. There was a all
for leaders and no class of people responded more imigniiicently
than the. college man. His success has been remarkable.

Alloreovcr. there is another field of service for many of us who
are too young or otherwise disqualified for military Work. The
college classroom work is not useless and unavaiiing; it has not
ceased to he of value and of interest. in it there is service which
will he of infinite value in the future. “The college man must
be the protector of idealism through the dark days of war and
in the period which will ensuc after peace is declared.” This—
liis share — will he an important factor in solving the problem of
democracy.

So with the word of greeting goes the ardent hope that every
student will persue his work eagerly and follow his ideals so
that he will be well fitted to respond to the call of his country
when needed.

OUR HONOR ROLL

There is an honor roll in this paper, on which are the names
of those men from our College who have dcdi Vated their lives to
the service of their country. .‘\ re we going to do the same?

Most of us feel that we cannot go on living our plain. common.
everyday lives while those we love are ” somewhere in France.”
We feel that we must suspend our usual labors. give. up our
little happinesses. and do something heroic—as they are doingr
over there. iliit there are different kinds of heroism, and ours
must be another kind.

We must live normal. healthful, happy lives, if we would
serve the nation. The time may come when we feel that life
holds for us no more real joy -- then we must live and be happy
deliberately.

The men at the front deserve a place on the nation’s honor
roll for their bravery. They must he brave, “ for there is much
to dare.” Shall we deserve a place on that same roll of honor
for out" strength? We must be strong, “for there is much to
sul'fcr.‘

 

THE BIRTHDAY OF “ NEWS " v

To our newcomers we wish to state that this is the ﬁrst i)ll'ti14
day of the “ News." We feel sure that’the publication has passed
the stage of infancy and is now stepping ont'for greater things.
’l‘iiough it is safe to say the " News ” is quite healthy, it still

needs your support.

. THE FIRST SUMMMER
SESSION

 

The first Summer Session of
the College. winch was held

from ~l'ul‘y 2 to August ii, mm:

was a distinct succc s- ro—
nouncement of the session was
not: made until about the first
of May. but the registration ‘in
many of the courses was quite
as large as could be permitted.
in all 250 students were eu-
rolled, the registration in |Eng~
lisli being particularly heavy.
The. personnel of the student
body was also very gliliift’ill‘u.‘
to 'lilL‘. College authorities.
There were 8o college grad-
uates. 4.3 normal school grad—
uates. and .i.t State College
students in the list. Among the
whole number were 106 high
school teachers. i2 high school
principals. 7 iiiin school pI‘C'
ccptresses. i2 elementary
school principals and super-
visors and 32 elementary school

    

 

 

‘ teachers.

«\luch interest was mani-
fested in the special lectures

and conferences and social
gatherings. A special couvo«
nation was held in the audi-

toriuin on liulv .itii at which
i’resideiit Iii-ubacher delivered
an address on ” Causes of the
War".

Dean l‘lorncr who acted as
director of the session gave a
course in iiiducationai Adiiiinis»
nation. and expressed his grati~
fication at the enthusiasm
exhibited by botii students and
faculty througimiit the session.
Other members of the faculty
were:

l‘rolessors \Voodard. birch-
enougii. iiccker, ix’isiey. Kirt-
land. Smith. in: Halo. Van

The College authorities hope
to widen the offerings for the
next summer session and to
make earlier announcement of
the courses. it is probable
that graduate credit will be
given in certain courses next
summer. College students will
be admitted to certain courses
but the summer sesion will be
devoted priinariiy to the needs
of teachers in service.
