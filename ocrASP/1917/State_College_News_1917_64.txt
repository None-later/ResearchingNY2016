l)r. Ili'u‘lmcher took for his
>Lll)jt‘.t‘l. ‘.\11ttu:oiiistic ideals
lit'llllltl the “far.” llis aim was
to set before the students who
are preparing to be teachers
and guides of the youth of the
nation the fundamental antag-
onisms between autocracy and
democracy. He said in part:

”.\merica entered the war be-
cause her democracy was
theratened by the pi 'ttical
practices which made war on
Iltill-t‘tittt‘lltlltlllt women and
children aml invaded the inner
sanctity of friendly nations. We
are keenly alive to the menace
against integrity of free peoples
and constitutional govrnment.
We recognize an inherent an-
l“ﬁonimn between a govern-
ment that engages in such un-
ethical practices and the des—
tiny of our democracy.

“The war had joined the is—
sue between a free government
and an absolute autoc‘acy. The
autocrat with airplanes, subma—
t‘lltes. Ilainc 1'n'ojectilcs, gas
bullets. among peace loving
democracies. is like the high-
wayman with a six‘shooter,
amongr peaceablc. unarmed vil~
age folk. liither the autocrat
must be restrained or democ-
racics must cease. .\ud the
event is not a foregone conclu~
sioir .v\utocracy has the virtue
of age and achievement. De-

 

.mocracy has the \V‘akness of

blunderine‘ youth.
Democracy Looks to Teachers
" To the teacher this is a very
responsible moment. For he
hind and beneath the struggle
lie antagonistic educational
ideals. .~\ntocracy uses educa—
tional means of a distinctive
kind to secure efﬁciency and
obedience to its units. llemoc-
racy uses its own appropriate
means to secure its enthusiasm

 

and individual initiative. .‘ihall
democracy renounce oibedi-
cure? Shall autocracy win the
day because it an command
the. slavish obedience of an
efficient man~pmver?

“ it is generally accepted that
(icrntany is lo-day reapng the
fruits of a well-defined philoso—
phy of life. effectively taught.
by its schools and universities
during the last fifty y 'ﬂl'S. a
philosophy that has dominated
its ruling class for two cen—
turies. 'l‘he Herman nation ex-
ent-plilies this philosophy to-
day; the masses exemplify it in
that wholesome nncouscimts—
ncss which Nietzsche cont-
mends in them; the military or
efficient class exemplifies it and
skillfully inculcates it as a na-
tional system. as a national
educational creed. it is espe-
cially desirable. therefore. that
the teachers in our great dc—
niocracy should fully comprc
hem] this educational creed of
autm'racy,
tiermany by its whole edu-
cational system g’lorilies the

exceptional man, to whom it
subordinates the great human

mass which counts for nothing;
save as cannon fodder in the
army. .‘\merica on the other
hand glorified the common
man: seeks to educate him, to
increase his comfort and his in-
dividual worth to himself.

” The educational system
carefully provides for the main-
tenance of the distinctions be.-
t'ween the cultured class and
the bread winners. The high
exponent of the doctrine of the
superman says: "the future of
iiertllttlt Kultur rests on the
sons of Prussian ofticers.’ :\nd
'i, titl.’ "l‘he masses were born
to serve and obey; and every
moment in which their limping
or crawling or ln‘oken—wimled
thoughts are at work shows
what trade mark (naturcl
branded thercon.’ He says the
masses are lit primarily for
‘canmnI—hidder' while the inas~
tcr caste are the ‘hie‘archy in
the kingdom of the intellect‘.‘
|"or them is reserved the ‘arisA
tot-racy of culture.’

" The purpose of education in
an autocrarv is clearly defined
by Nietsche's philosophical ar~
tg‘umcuts therefore, it is to
make lite master conscious of

Let this be your slogan for

is to teach the masses that the

Goethe’s Germany Gone

“ 'I‘hc Germany of Goethe
and Schiller and lleethoven has”
given way unconsciously on the
part of the masses, consciously
and ('lesitfnedly on the part of
the autocracy, to a nationof
cruelty. of unscrupulous ambi-
tions, of almost superhuman
ingenuity. The philosophy of
.‘Vietzsche has found concrete
expression in the Herman peo—
