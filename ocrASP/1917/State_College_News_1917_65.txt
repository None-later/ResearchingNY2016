One of the most, important
steps in the development of
student spirit and power in

munication between the stu-

represent the opinion of the
student body.

body composed of Seniors who
have won places of promi—
nence in scholarship and stu-
dent activities. and who have a
capacity for leadership.

which was appointed by the
faculty consisted of Kolin

Edith Wallace. Margaret
Christ, Willard l’earsall, Stan-
ley G. Fitzgerald, Edward 1...
Long, Edith ‘E. Rose, Emma
H. Cray. Marion M. Payne,
Guy V. Bruce.

’l‘his Council. as will all sub-
sequent councils, had seats
upon the platform at student

assemblies; governed inter-
class contests, other than
athletics; administered the

rules governingr the various
competitions for officers; ad~
ministered the college cus-
toms; and made recommenda-
tions to the student assembly.
On Moving—up Day the second
Student Council was chosen.
Five members were appointed
by the faculty and live by the
outgoing.r council. After the
customary u/l’ovintrup Day
