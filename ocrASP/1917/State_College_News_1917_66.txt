STUDENT CONVOCATION

Dean Pierce addresses Freshmen

(tn 'l‘hnrsday last the formal
opening of the College took
place. Dr. A. lx’. .lh‘ubacher
presided and Dean ii. if.
llorner. Miss Anna l3. McClel—
land and Dr, L. Richardson oc—
cupied seats of honor. After
the singing of “Matcrna” by
the student body, and the read—
ian of the Scripture by Dr.
Richardson, Dr. A. R. Bru—
liacher and Dean llorner (le~
livered addresses. The exer-
cises were closed with the sine;—

'illg‘ of “America.”

Dr. liru‘bacher took for his
subject "Antagonistic ideals
lit'llillil the War." His aim was
to set before the students who
are preparing to be teachers
and guides of the youth of the
nation the fumlamental antag—
onisms between autocacy and
democ‘iacv. l‘lc said in part:

".’\ll'l('l‘lt‘zl entered the war be—
cause her demoe-acy was
theratencd by the piratical
practices which made war on
Illill-t‘tllll‘llilllllll women and
children and invaded the inner
sanctity of friendly nations. We
are keenly alive to the menace
against integrity of free peoples
and Constitutional govrnment.

.‘|.\’e recognize an inherent an—

tagonism between a govern—
ment that engages in such un—
ethical p ‘aetices and the des—
tiny of our democracy.

“ The war had joined the is—
sue between a free government
and an absolute antocracy. 'I‘he
autocrat with airplanes. subma—
rines. tlame projectiles. gas
bullets. among peace loving
democracies. is like the high—
waymau with a six-shooter.
among; peaceable, unarmed \Iilv
lac-je folk. lCither the autocrat
must be restrained or demoe—
‘acies must cease. .\nd the
event is not a foregone conclu-
sion. :\utm‘racy has the virtue
of age and achievement. De-

.Inocracy has the weakness of

blunderiug youth.
Democracy Looks to Teachers
" To the teacher this is a Very
responsible moment. For he-
hind and beneath the struggle
lie antagonistic educational
ideals. .=\utocracy uses educa-
tional means of a distinctive
kind to secure efﬁciency and
obedience to its units. Democ-
racy uses its own appropriate
means to secure its enthusiasm

 

and individual initiative. Shall
dcnioci'acy renounce orbedi-e
ence? Shall autocracy win the
day because it can command
the slavish obedience of an
cflicicnt: nian—ptnvcr?

“ It is generally accepted that
tieriuauy is toalay reaping the
fruits of a well—defined philoso—
phy of life. effectively taught
by its schools and universities
during the last fifty years. a
philosophy that has dominated
its ruling class for two cen—
ti'rics. 'l‘he German nation ex-
emplities this philosophy to—
day; the masses exemplify it in
that wholesome unconscious—
ncss which Nietzsche com»
mcmls in them; the military or
efficient class exempliﬁes it and
skillfully inculcates it as a na—
tional system. as a national
educational creed. it is espe~
cially desirable. therefore. that
the teachers in our great de-
mocracy should fully comiprc:
bend this educatiomil creed of
aiumracy.

" (iermiauy by its whole edu—
cational system g‘lorilies the

exceptional man. to whom it

sulmrdinates the. great human
mass which counts for nothing
save as cannon fodder in the
army. America on the other
hand glorified the common
man; seeks to educate him, to
increase his comfort and his in—
dividual \vorth to himself.

" The educational system
carefully provides for the main-
tenance of the distinctions be—
tween the cultured class and
the bread winners. 'l‘he high
exponent of the doctrine of the.
superman says: "l‘he future of
licrinnn lx'ultur rests on the
sons of l'russian ofﬁcers.’ .--\nd
again: "I‘he masses were born
to serve and obey; aml every
moment in which their limping
or crawling or l)l'lll((3l1—\VlllllL‘tl
thoughts are at work shows
what trade mark (naturei
bramch tlmreon.’ lle s is the
masses are lit primart.y for
‘canmni-fodder' while the mas-
tcr casti- are the ‘hie'varchy in
the lvcing‘doni of the inte ‘t.’
lior them is reserved the ‘ai s-
tocracy of culture.’

ominous. That a nation can in

is a c ‘eat tribute to its schools

propouation of the doctrine of

lack of sympathy for his lot.
