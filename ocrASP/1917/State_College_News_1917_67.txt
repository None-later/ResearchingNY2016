COME OUT FOR THE NEWS

It is with deep regret that we ﬁnd that four members of the
“ News ” board have not returned to College. Alfred E. Dedickc
’18, Editor-in-chicf of the paper last year, whose untirint,r efforts
and ability made the State College News a reality and successful
enterprise, is a commissioned ofﬁcer in the Regular Army.
Henry L. Grecnblatt ’18. who devoted so much time to the man-
agement of the “ News ” has been appointed manager of a local
business establishment. Kathryn Linehan ’19 and Arnold N01th
’20, although they had been elected only recently, had displayed
ability which would be of great value to us this year. We wish
them success in their new undertakings.

In accordance with the management of the publication their
places must be lillcd by students who demonstrate capacity for
the work. The only way to exhibit one’s ability is to write
articles [or pnblicatimi and elections will be made solely on this
basis.

No previous newspaper experience is necessary although it is
very desirable. Any students who desire to enter the competition
are requested to report to one of the Senior Editors.

To those students who lean toward college journalism, and to
those who have been connected with other school publications
the work will be most attractive.

Remember it is the students’ paper and must he supported by
by them. Its columns are open to all students and their contri-
butions are always welcomed. Now is the time to enter the race
for it will last only three weeks.

To the Editors of S. C. News:

Expressing the general opinion of youngr women students, I
arise to protest the usurpation of the test room. Many of us have
schedules which begin at 8:10 in the mornng and continue inter-
mittently until 4:35 or 5 :30. This makes a long, tiring (lay pill“
tieularly if one carries her lunch and is compelled to remain in
the building from morningr until night. The Rest Room has in
the past afforded a convenient place for a student to eat and at
the same time relax for a few minutes between classes. Often
if a student feels faint or sickly a half hour of resting; will often
improve matters. This is a much better policy than waiting for
an interview with Miss Pierce and perhaps missingr classes, while
a few minutes of rest would be sufﬁcient. :-\ visiting physician
remarked a short time ago that it was nothing less than cruel to
maintain such a small rest room for hundreds of girls. If a small
rest room was considered cruelty what about no rest room at all?
