STUDENT CONVOCATION
Continued from page I
attained in the battlefields; the
masses have slavishly served as
caution fodder; the military
supermen have been above
morality. as shown in the Lusi-
tania episode, by the insolent
and wanton destruction of
property, by the cruel treat-

ment of conquered civilians.

“ You, the future teachers of
our free people. are at the apex
of rlcmtn‘racyin tryng to edu-
cate the masses. and it is for
you to reverse this sad and dis-
couragintr picture.

“ In carrying otit this educa-
tional purpose of democracy
you are in a very real sense at
war with autocracy.

" in carrying out this pro-
gram of sweet reasonableness,
human sympathy and intellec«
tnal humility into the lives of
the great human mass, you are
comiliatling the vicious philoso-
phy of that autocraey whose
engines of war are daily dealing
death to our brave boys on the
firing" line. We are all enlisted
in the cause of humanity in its
struggle to free itself ﬁnally
from the incubus of an arrogant
and cruel. selfsappointed master
class.”

Dian llorner then read the
names of the youngr men of the
College who are in military scr-
vicc, while the students stood
in honor to them.

.-\fter which he tried to im—
press upon the students the im-
mensity of the cost of the war
both in money and in casual—
ties. He emphasized the fact
that we had scarcely felt as yet

any of the hardships of war and

were il\’lllg‘ our lirw in much
the same way as Ill tunes of

 

peace. He urged us to start

now to prepare ourselves in'

practices of economy and thrift
and thereby lessen future sul—
ferintr.

Dean Piercc's Address

Miss Anna ii. Pierce, Dean of
Women, met the members of
the Freshmen class in the Audi-
torium on Friday morning last.
She reminded them that in pur—
suing their college course they
must prepare themselves for a
part in the period of construc-
tion and rectmstruction which
is to follow the war. In speak—
int;~ of the new life at college
she. compared their cases to
trans-planting" from gardens
cared by those with whom
their life had been so far spent,
to new gardens surrounded by
hundreds of new lives. After
the period of wilting which is
sure to follow transplanting,
sht- assured them that they
would raise their heads and
find the same glad old sun and
many loving. helping hands.
From that time they will feel
at home and very happy.

She urged them to set about
adapting themselves to. their
environments with a determin-
ation to make a clean sweep
of all weaknesses and to estab-
lish virtues in their places,

and at the same time to get in

the game of real living; and not
to become intellectual grinds.
fihc pointed out the value of
usthr good couuuon sense in
matters under their control by
sleeping. eating and dressing
properly and then doingr their
appointed tasks courageously
and conscientiously.

in closing Dean 'lf'ierce said:
“ [for your new life take for
your motto the watchword of

the Camp Fire Girls, “‘Wohelo,”

the double initials of work,
health, and love and may your
college course he a wonderful

blessing to you.

 

‘ SCHOOL OF PRACTICAL
ARTS

Miss Wilson met the if. E.

Seniors Friday at one o’clock,

and discussed plans for living
at the practice house. Marion
l’eterson, Carolyn Dirge, Clare.
i.ally, Mabel l lolliday, and
.r\_t;'nes .li‘oster are living at the
house now.

Miss Van l.ic\\' is director of
the .\lh.'lny city food conserva-
tion movement. Madge Blood-
good ’I5 is assistant director.

The State lirlucation Depart-
ment is launching a plan to
reorganize all teachers’ courses
in Home licouon‘li‘ \Vhen
t‘rnllplctt'd to the satisfactirm of
the Department. none but four—
)ear courses will he offered in
any of the colleges in the State.

The registration in the men's

 

 

night School cl. ‘ses is particu-
larly heavy. More than can be
accepted have applied for
admission. A careful selection
will have to [be made, to clim-
iuatc enough to make the
classes of manageable size.

in answer to advertising pro-
paganda put out last week,
thirty men have made inquiries
crmrerning‘ the day courses. A
meeting was held Friday night,
and Professor Smith discussed
the courses. liour men have
already enrolled and others are
considering.

Professor Smith has started
a plan for Work by which a man
works in an industrial shop for
a half-day. and comes to college
for classes the rest of the day.
This system of working on a
cooperative basis is used with
great success in the engineer-
ing courses of the. University
of Cincinnati. Two men are
now studying at this college
under this plan. They are
employed at the Consolidated
('ar ‘Co. One works in the
mornng and comes to college
in the afternoon. while the
other attends college in the
morning and works in the
ttli‘CI'tluntl. Every ofﬁcer of the
(,‘onsolidated Car Co, from the
president down. have shown
great interest in this plan,
which promises to make quite
a change in the future registra-
tion. Mr. Smith is confident of
its success.
