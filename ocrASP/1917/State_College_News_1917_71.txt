STUDENT ASSEMBLY

1918 Myskania Presides For First Time At The
Student Assembly On September 28th.

.Ioscplt A. \'\/'alker, President
of the Senior Class and mem-
ber of Student Council, ex-
tended a welcome to those
present and addressed them on
the subject of the Student's tax.
He said that we have come to
collch at an opportune time,
for since great things are being;r
done in the world so also they
ought to be accomplished in
this college. Just as the
United States last spring
adopted a system of universal
service, conscription, so like—
wise did State College devise a
scheme by means of which
every man and woman regis-
tered here would be able to do
his or her hit. l‘lerctofore the
volunteer system had been in
practice, which produced many
strong supporters and some
slackers. Among,r the latter
may be numbered the man who
reads a college publication over
someonc’s shoulder. The many
college units which depended
upon these voluntary contribu—
tions for support often failed to
realize their object. Conse—
quently last year the four
classes then in attendance
voted a student’s tax.

The members of Student
Council have gone over the
estimated expenses offered by
the various organizations, and

 

have found the “following
ﬁgures as items:
“ The Echo ” . . . . . . . . . $800
“ State College News ". 900
Freshman Manual . . . . . 100
Press Club . . . . . . . . . .. 100
basketball . . . . . . . . . .. 1,200
Total . . . . . . . . . . . . . . $3,100

A tax of live dollars per
capita, levied on each of the
six hundred and ﬁfty people
registered, will cover the
necessary amount and leave a
balance to be used as a con-
tingency fund.

All colleges use this system
of taxation to put thier. organi-
zations on a sure footing. Stud-
ents here have no tuition to
pay. and no expenses except

 

personal ones. Yet they leave
this colich well endowed with
a professional training. Let
everyone do what he can for
the college that is doing so
much for him. Let each hope
for a spontaneous general pay-
ment, so that a precedent may
be established of which all may
be proud.

[Followingr Mr. Walker’s
speech, Mr. ‘Maroney, the new
physical director, greeted the
assembly and spoke briefly of
the athletic situation. State

't'ollege has been seriously af-

fectcd by the present crisis,
as have all colleges, and conse—
quently the future of football
and baseball here is uncertain.
There remains no reason, how-
ever, why a basketball team
should not be organized. It is
important that every man try
out for the team, and that
cvey student push morally and
ﬁnancially to insure a prosper-
ous year.

Dean llorner then requested
‘ach student to consult the re-
vised list of classes on the bul—
letin board, and advise him of
any errors found there.-

Mr. Christensen, President
of College Club, spoke of the
aims and requirements of the
organization. There are no
dues asked of the members,
outside of interest and attend-
ance. Any student may be-
come a member. Suggestions
concerninganen in the vicinity
capable of handling an interest—
ing subject in an interesting
way, will be appreciated by the
officers of the club.

Miss Schcrmerhorn spoke a
few words concerning the Y.
W. C. A. reception.

In conclusion Dean Pierce
advised the students of the
compulsory attendance at
chapel on Friday mornings,
and of the new seating list.
Any reasons for irregular
attendance or excuses for
absence should 2belilcd in Miss
l’ierce's ofﬁce where they will
receive eonsideraion. A plan
for [Ol‘llllllﬂ' a Red Cross unit
was also offered.

MANIFEST

“ When people do well, they
should be praised for it " has
been said by seine sage. It is
impossible to refrain from ex-
pressing pride at the splendid
way in which the students of
State College have responded to
the payment of the ﬁve dollars
tax.

“ You can’t expect to get the
majority of students to pay the
ﬁrst day,” was the phophesy of
many. But at three o’clock
Monday, 553 students out of the
total registration of 765, had al-
rcadypaid. When the office
closed the magniﬁcent sum of
$2,850 had been collected.

STA'YI'E. COLLEGE

New York State Secretary E.
Galloway, of Student Y. M. C.
A., was at the College last Fri-
day afternoon in the interests of
the College branch of the as—
sociation. This organization is
one of the newest in the College,
yet promises to become one of
the most important. Early last
spring the State College branch
was organized, with Theodore
W. Cassavant ’19 as President,
Ernest Trippe ’20,, Vice—Presi-
dent, and Allen L. Gillett ’19,
Secretary and Treasurer. The
army and farm cadet service
soon took a number of the mem—
bers, including the President
and Secretary-Treasurcr; and
the work was dropped for the
spring term. During the sum-
mer two delegates, Theodore
Cassavant and Ernest Trippe,
were sent to the Student Y. M.
C. A. conference at Northﬁcld.
This fall an attempt is being
made to form a strong branch at
State College.

Duringr the next few days
some member of the association
will approach every man of
State College and ask his sup
port in this undertaking. Men,
this is your opportunity for ser—
vicel Be ready to join when
you are asked! Toward the end
of the week a meeting will be
called for the purpose of ex-
plainiug the conditions for mem-
bership and the proposed work
of the society. All men of the
College, especially men of 1921,
are urged to attend. Watch the
bulletin board for announce-
meut.
