CONSUMERS’ LEAGUE
. CONTEST

, , The New York State 'Con-
sumers’ League offers ﬁve dol—

. lars to the person who writes the
j best ” Shop Early ” jingle, to
_ be used in the annual State cam-

paign for early shopping.

Jingles from four to eight
lines are most effective. Em-
‘phasize the point, "If you buy
‘a X’mas present, buy it early,”
.for the public may not shop as
extensively as usual in war
times. Give your jingle to one
'of the ofﬁcers of our College
League before October 12th, and
she will see that it is sent to the
; State headquarters.

Here is. a sample:
l’vuy before the rush comes.

‘Rily before the slush comes—

Duy your presents now!

 

Mr. Wood wishes to acknowl-
edge the very valuable services
rendered by Myskania in the

collection of the blanket tax.
