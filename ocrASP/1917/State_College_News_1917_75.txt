STUDENT '

ASSEMBLY

October 5th

Miss Cobb Addresses Freshmen

Dean I-lorner opened strident
assesmbly with the following
announcements:

Beginning Friday. October
[2. the Friday morning assem—
bly will be compulsory and
students will he required to
seat themselves according to
the plans posted on the bulletin
boards. The assembly next
Friday will take the form of a
” College Sing.”

In accordance with the cus-
tom initiated last y ‘ar all fresh-
men have been assigned to
their Faculty Atlvisors. The
purpose of this assignment is
that the faculty may become
more intimately acquainted
with the students. and there—
fore'more in a position to ren—
der assistance in case of
trouble. The students should
realize that the faculty desires
to help anrl should feel at
liberty to consult not only their
advisors. but any member of
the faculty.

After these preliminary an-
nouncements Miss Cobb spoke
a few moments of the library
accommodations. There are,
besides our own college library,
the State library, the Prynn,
the Y. M, A. and the Pine Hills
branch of the Public Library.
The work in the State Library
and 'the College Library must
be chiefly reference as they do
not loan books. However, the
(‘ollege Library does allow
books to be taken out over
night or over Sunday. Students
should learn to consult the
catalogue first. in looking for
l'umks. This saves much time
for it shows whether the book
is in the library or not. and if
it is. the card gives the call
number and shows where to
ﬁnd it. There are three kinds
of cards in the catalogue: first.
those which classify according
to the author’s names; second.
those which classify accm‘ding
subjects; and third. those
which classify according to
titles. The system used in all
Eastern libraries '
or decimal classiﬁcation. There
are two numbers on the cards
—— the ﬁrst number. or the top

 

' one denotes the class. the lower

is the Dewey

 

 

number refers to the author’s
name. '

This is but a suggestion of
the numerous requirements for
the use of libraries. In order
to better acquaint the students
with these requirements IMiss
Cobb will meet the freshmen in
groups of twenty. The assign-
ments for these meetings will
be posted on the bulletin boards
and the students must report at
their scheduled time. They will
be excused from student assem-
bly for this purpose,
