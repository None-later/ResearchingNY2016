THE GREAT RESPONSE

i_'l‘l1e disheartening reports coming from all sides were greatly
offset last week by the action of the students of State College.
Like so many other individuals in the world they were afforded
an. opportunity to show what they really were when put to
the 't‘est.‘ ’

The results of this test have been wonderful. First of all.
it‘ has reinforced the democracy which is the, pride of State
Collge. it has produced an example of our College loyalty to
which we may always refer with pride—nincdenths of the
students responded immediately in the payment of a self—im-
posed tax. It has cleared up the question forever that there
were ,“slackei-s" in our midst. Finally, it has brought about
adiatmosphere of congeniality and cooperation which will work
wonders for our college. just think of the delightful times
we will have together at the basketball games! Then too,
everybOdy will have the “ Echo” and the “News,” which they
will cherish. more each year after leaving college. in brief,
everybody will have a share in the intersts of college life.

Now aren’t you proud? You have every reason to be so.
Niev‘er have our colors been of such‘ pure gold and royal purple!

. ' IT'S UP To YOU

About ten minutes" ride from Albany there is a firm brown
road which winds in and out between corn lields dotted with

«golden pumpkins. It is bordered by gay red sumach, pretty

wild asters. and golden glow. in the distance russet hills
lean against‘a' hazy sky." The leaves are turning red and gold
0151f, there how, and the fruit hangs heavy from the trees. ‘

Have you, too, seen the good old furrowed earth yieldingr
the last of her golden harvest? Have you felt the keen October
wind out there bring a glow to your cheeks? Didn’t it ever
occur to you that the country is just as delightful in the autumn
as, it is in- the summer? in fact. October is the most wonderful
month of the year. Why don’t vou take advantage of the country
now as you did (luringr the slimmer? Surely you could not find
a more ideal time for hiking. The air has just enough mug in
it,':and the sun is never too hot. 'i‘his vicinity is. well supplied
with beautiful roads leading in every direction. it’s up to you
to discover them.

"When you go to the theater these days you are not sure
whether you will be pleased or 11ot,— you simply pay your
money and take the risk. Whether it is a mediocre drama or
whether it is only a “ movies ’-’ in some stuffy amusement place.
_\'1:tl call it'recreation. You are always invi:rn_rated lry a brisk
walk in the country, with a campfire perhaps. near a charming

little creek. You. know this, yet —. , Well, why waste a couple
of hours in the afternoon 'after classes or on Saturday doing a
little bit of everything and not much of anything. It’s up to
you to see those leaves before the frost bites them from the
trees, and it‘s up to you to feel that ﬁrm brown earth under your

 

 

 

and hike l

 

‘fcet before'the'snow comes. So—get out your hiking tags,—

'l‘|u_: students of the college take this opportunity to express
their appreciation to Mr, Chester J. Wood for the great service
be rendered them in collectingr the student tax.
