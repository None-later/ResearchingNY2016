STUDENT ASSEMBLY

The ﬁrst ” College Sing" of
the. entire student body was a
reimrkablc success and brimful
of hearty fellowship. Joseph
Walker, President of the Senior
Class, spoke a few words in
praise of the new State College

efforts of the committee who
prepared it. The alumni of the
older colleges consider the songr
books of their alma mater as
priceless'posscssions for they
bring back memories of under—

to inaugurate “College sings”
so that when we have gone out
from State College; we may
have memories that willrmcan
much.
