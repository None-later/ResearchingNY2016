It is ‘our aim to become
acquainted with the labor and
social conditions which sur-
round us. Should we not all be
vitally interesth in the prob—
lems which affect each and
every one of us? It is our task
as college students to do all in
our power to educate the pub-
lic -l:y inducing them. when pur-
chasing. to demand articles
bearing the white label. This
signiﬁes that such articles were
made under sanitary condi-
tions.

At the present time the Con—
sumers’ League is confronted
by the gravest crisis in its
history. There is danger that
its achievements of a quarter
Century may be largely undone
in a low \VL'L'h‘H in the effort to
