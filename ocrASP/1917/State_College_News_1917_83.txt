NEW YORK STATE COLLEGE FOR TEACHERS
ALBANY; N. Y.,Oe'roasn 24, 1917

DR. FINLEY GIVES ADVICE

Must Prepare for Peace in Time of War

The majority of the students
attended the 'J.‘hursday and liri—
day evening sessions of the con-
vocation. 'l'he distinguished
representatives of our Allies
presented the audience with au-
thentic accounts of the rela-
tion of the school to the war.
Henry Van Dykc gave an in—
[trusting discussion of the sys-
tem of education that made the
war possible. Now as never
before, the influence, results,
and value of the different edu-
cational schemes are facing
judgment, and eventually con-
demnation or approval in the
minds of prominent as well as
obscure educators. We must
face a different problem than
we might have, had no war oc-
curred, and from our great
leader, Dr. John H. Finley, in
an article recently published,
comes the keynote of the edu-
cational problem of which we
must do our part:

“ For three years i have been
urging that we should compel
a general mobilization of our
youth as well as of our adults
for the common defense of our
ideals; a universal conscription
for training and for service. I
have objected, incidentally, to

making the schoolboys take the

gun end of the proposition ex-
cept as a ﬁnal necessity, be-
cause 1 did not want them to
carry into a new generation the
idea that fighting with a gun
was the only form of valor for
means of patriotic service.
With remarkable unanimity
and prevision, the State has
risen to the higher conception

and deﬁnition. Before the (311-.
action of the federal law of se-‘
lcetive draft for service, the'
State of New York had enacted
a law for compulsory training‘

under which every boy between
the ages of Sixteen and nine-

teen, whether in school or not,;
is required to be preparing himv'
self for some vocational scrvrce;

useful to the State, either mili—
tary in the narrower sense or
industrial or agricultural or
commercial.

This, in turn, rests upon an—
other law of even wider scope
or vastcr inﬂuence, the law
which requires the physical

 

training and help the educalion of
every boy and girl in the State
over eight; years of age, whether
in public or private school.

These laws, the first and
foremost measures of their
kind in any State give intima-
tion of the great democratic
basic provision, in addition to
the mental and moral training,
which the State of New York
is making for its future service
to the nation. For in this ser-
vice I am coming to think of
every school not only as a com—
munity centre but a national
centre.

To Prepare for Peace Needs

In this day of the nation’s
war need we must firmly estab—
lish and practise this relation—
ship so that, in the days of as
great peace need, the schools
will be ready for a service com-
parable with that which they
are even now rising. to give in
the promotion of their coliti-
try’s defense.

It is on this common founda—
tion of training that we are to
form the ‘ sacred union’ of all
Americans, to save and serve
America and. through America,
the world, for the freedom of
which we are now ﬁghting.
And what an opportunity and
responsibility comes to the
teacher. [t is so great an oppor—
tunity, so grave a responsibil-
ity. that one cannot seek to
teach in these days from any
low motive. I wonder how
there can be petty squabbling
or personal haggling on their
part or that of boards of educa-
tion in the face of such oppor«
tunities and responsibilities.
There has come out of the crisis‘
a realization of the supreme
importance of the teacher and a?
recognition which we must rise'
tomcet. - ‘

Our schoolmaster Presidenti
has made a special appeal to
the teachers, asking,r them to
aid ‘a deeper understanding: of
the meaning and aims of de-
mocracy’ and the ’problcms
of national life.’ ‘These * * *
lessons of the war,’ he says.
‘must be learned quickly if we
are intelligently and success
fullv to defend our institu-
tions.’ ‘

Dangers of Situation

There is danger that we shall
find our own minds distracted
and our long-cherished moral
values disturbed by the events
of the war, but there is greater
danger that we shall fail to
take advantage of the new val-
ties that are rising, that we
shall be blind to opportunities
for spiritual enrichment and iii-
dustrial renovations, that yve
shall go on livingr and teaching;
in a narrow, selﬁsh, horizon
when the most momentous
(lays in the world’s history are
comingr to one eternity and go—
ing into the other. if we. are
beyond the age of the draft,
we are none of us beyond self-
conscription. it is to the teach-
ers after the soldiers and the
men who are to feed and equip
them that the President has
made his first special appeal
that we conscript ourselves.-

There is a twofold obliga-
tion on the teacher. First, it is
essential that we defend the in-
tellectual frontiers of our de~
mocracy. We must ‘dig our-
selves into' their trenches and
hold them. Second, the schools.
public and private, teachers and
pupils alike, must take an act—
ive part in helping the nation
in the ﬁght.

\Vith rceard to the ﬁrst obli—
gation: We must teach the
truth about the war. Teachers
must instil and nourish in
their millions of pupils a spirit
of unselfish sacriﬁce. to the end
that they shall be united in
support of this world cause
which President Wilson deﬁned
for all of us and‘ for all time
when he said:

'Thc object of this war is to
deliver the free peoples of the
world from the menace and the
actual power of a vast militarv
establishment controlled bv ir-
responsible e'overnment. which,
havingr secretly planned to
dominate the world, proceeded
to carrv the plan out without
rceard either to the sacred ob—

STUDENTEEMBLY

Patriotic Rally

The students met on Friday,
October 19th, , to discuss and
pledge Liberty Bonds under the
guidance of the Liberty Bond
Committee of the faculty.

Mr. Joseph Walker opened
the meeting,r with announce-
ments. The Senior Council and
faculty in charge of the student
tax recently levied have been
checking up the names of those
who are recorded as not having
paid. The list of Freshman has
been gone over, and the lists of
the other classes will be treated
likewise soon. So far the Coun-
cil has the names of 64 people
who, perhaps because of a jus-
tiﬁable reason, have neglected
to do their part in the cam-
paign. It is desirable that
these people make their posi-
tion clear, and to that end they
are requested to hand in at the
Registrar’s oﬁicc either the five
dollars due or a written state—
ment to Mr. l‘lidley, in charge,
stating the reason for their de-
lay. Later the list, revised,
will be published.

The members of the Senior
class are asked to write up their
biographical sketches for the
“ Pcdagoguc.” These should
include the name of the high
school or preparatory school at-
tended,'thc year of graduation
from that school, the names of
college organizations with
which one has been connected.
and other data of interest.

After November Ist the four
meetings of Student Assembly
occurring,r during,r each month
will be assigned as follows:
The ﬁrst to class meetings, the
second and fourth to assemblies
in charge of Student Council,
and the third to an assembly
not in charge of Student Coun-
cil. Attendance at all of these
will be compulsory.
