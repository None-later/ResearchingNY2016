Miss Van Liew’s mother, 01
Seattle, Wash” is enjoying an
extended visit in town.

The 't‘ollowing members of
tlie_Seuior class in Home Eco-
nomics were initiated liito
Omicron Nu on Monday even—
ling, October 22: Caroline

Dirge, Nellie Britten, Lillian,

iussy, Amy Dayton, Edith
Wood-roll, Iilsie Crissey, Mabel
Laur, Mabel ,lrlolliday, Elmetta
Van Deloo.

This is the largest number
that has been taken into this

organization at one time. We

feel that this is due, not only
to the size of the present Senior
class, which is larger than‘
usual, but also to the higher
standard of scholarship which
has been maintained within the
last two years. This meeting
was held at Mrs. Frear’s, 598.
Madison avenue.

Miss Marion Gemmill. of the
class of i916, has a position in:
the lillis Hospital, Schenectady,
as dietitian. Miss Rachel Har-
rison, of the class of i915, is
now teaching Home Economics
in the Chaihani Episcopal Ii1—'
stitutiou, (Thatham, Va. Miss
Harrison has complete charge
of her own department, has
planned the work, purchased
equipment, and is assisting in‘
supervising the girls’ dormi-
tories. i"

 

/\ Community Kitchen has
been opened in the County,
Court House in this city, under
the supervision of the Execu-
tive Committee for Food Con-'
sei'vation in the City of Albany.
Lunches are being served in the
kitchen daily. The following
Senior students are having di~
rect supervision ol this work
under the city agent. Miss
LVIIHIQ'C l'llootlgood: Elmetta
Van Deloo. Geneva Pawel. Nel—
lie Tyrrell and Nellie Britten.
The Junior students who are
now taking Cookery 3 are hav-
ing an opportunity to get lunch-
room practice in this kitchen.
This is distinctly a commercial
problem. and the experience
gained is exceedingly valuable.

Gymnasium EXHIBITION

The exhibition last Wednes-
day for the entertainment ot‘
the State Superintendents of
Schools was all that we could
have hoped for. The girls had
had but two (lays’ practice, yet
there was the same “ pep ” and
snap to the work that charac-
terizes all of Miss Gray’s
classes. The unusual success
of the ‘liurried preparation is a
great credit not only to Miss
Iiray, but also to the girls.

There were three numbers
on the program. The ﬁrst was
a (lance by six girls of last
year’s junior gym class. The
second was buck work by rcp-
resentatives of all the classes.
Lastly was a wand drill. This,
too. was given by girls selected
from all the classes.
