STATE COLLEGE

RED CROSS

At a meeting of the executiVe
officers and chairmen of the
committees of the, Red Cross
Auxiliary of the college, plans
were formulated for an active
membership campaign. The
slogan is, “Every member of
Qtate College a member of Red
Cross."

TWO of the committees are
already engaged in active work.
Y-arn has been given out for the
knitting. Room P—i, in the
lower hall of the main building,
has been given over to the Red
Cross.

The work in surgical dress-
ings was started Tuesday, Oc-
tober 16th, under the direction
of Mrs. Kinncar. who has had
char-go during,r the summer of
the Red Cross headquarters in
Albany. Our ﬁrst afternoon
[03 compresses were made,
which was a very good begin-
ning. At our second meeting,
'l‘hursday, 160 compresses were
made. This work is done every
Tuesday and Thursday after-
noon from 1 o’clock until 5:30
o'clock.

As the Albany Chapter does
not furnish materials free of
charge to any auxiliary chap~
ter, and as we had no money
with which to buy gauze, we
were at a loss to know what to
do. Miss Laura Townsend of
Albany hassupplicd us with all
our materials, for which we are
most grateful. The least we
can do to show our apprecia-
tion of lMlSS Townsend’s kind-
ness is to send to the Albany
Chapter the best work it has
ever received.

STUDENT ASSEMBLY
Continued from page I

In Room [l-I, opening,r off
the lower hall in the Main
Building, the Red Cross work—
ers meet on Tuesdays and
'.l.lhursdays, and will welcome
assistance.

Professor Decker, chairman
of the Faculty Committee on
Liberty Bonds, was then pre-
sented and conducted the re—
mainder of the meeting. He
put before the students brieﬂy
the duty that we owe our
Honor ‘Men in backing,r them
with funds to carry on this war.
He said that although the indi—
vidual means at the disposal of
each one of us may be smaller
than those of students in other
colleges, yet we in larger units
might purchase a Bond and ﬁt
its denomination to the re-
sourccs of the unit. He sug-
tbat the customary
Memorial Fund be given in the
form of a Liberty Bond. I

Following this appeal, the
various class presidents arose
in turn and spoke for their or-
ganizations. Plans have been
perfected or are in the making
for each, class to purchase a
lloud of large denomination.

Mr. Earl Sutherland then
gave a report of real sacriﬁce.
The Athletic Council decided
to cut down the appropriation
for the basketball team one
hundred dollars, and have de—
cidcd to use that one hundred
dollars to buy Liberty Bonds.

One sorority, Psi Gamma.
has also applied for a Bond.
