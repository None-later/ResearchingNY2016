VOL. II No. 7

With the departure
State College of lf-‘rot. Harry
Bradley Smith, A. 15., l’d. M.-,
Director of the School of
Practical Arts, a great loss is
incurred. Duringr the years
which Prof. Smith has spent»
here he has been the center of
a circle of influence whose area
can never quite be computed.
Students who have worked
with him have found him an
inspiring teacher, a fair judge
in any dealing, a friend with
sincere motives. Those who
have not been fortunate enough
to be connected with him in
class work have achnired,
among other qualities, his uu~
failngr interest in his work and
instant cooperation with any
plan conceived for the better—
ment of the college. Just as
everyone is sorry he is going,
so everyone wishes him well in
the responsible ﬁeld he will
enter. *

tional Education of \\'ashing—

State College Loses Professor Smith

Director of School of Practical Arts Accepts Fine Government
' Position

l'rof. Smith came here in
1910, the ﬁrst of lJ‘ebrnary.
'l‘rior to that time no Home
Economics or industrial work
of any kind had been done in
the college. Prof. Smith

men Were registered in the
industrial Departmmt. Mr.
Smith taught everything in this
department. with assistance
from Mr. illrke in woodwork-
ing, barging, and foundry work.

 

 

 

 

Machine Shop, I 9/7 t

recalls walking tl1rt.)ug'h the
rooms, devoid of any equip»
ment or furniture, with Dr.
Milne. lirom February until
the next summer Prof. Smith
had charge of the Physics
Department during the illness
of Dr. Wetmore. and also
organized Courses for the new
branch of college, bought
equipment and litth up the
rooms ready for use.

in September, 1910, the ﬁrst
classes began. Miss Garrison,
Mr. Burke, Miss Peters—now
Mrs. Van Horne—and the
present director were then the
only teachers, but the registra-
tion was so large that Miss
Steele was hired the next
month. There were seven sub-
jects taught in the H. 'E.
Department. The three classes
of girls engaged in- the work
were: ﬁrst, the one-year girls,
college or Normal graduates;
second, the two-year regular
1'1. E. students; third, the few
four—year students most of
whom graduated in 1913. Nine

 

/\ student, l.. H. leach, 1912,
was hired for half a year to
assist in the machine shop.
This shop was ﬁtted up
temporarily with one tiny lathe
and secondhand machinery
from the Fairbanks Co. Miss
Perine, of the Fine Arts De.
partment, taught drawing for
men and women. Through the
organizing ability of Miss
Peters, the cooperation of Miss
Perine and Prof. Bronson, and

Mr. Burke’s ability to adapt»

himself to lines of mechanical
work in which he was not a
specialist, Prof. Smith was able
to make the ﬁrst year a success.

Domestic Science developed
rapidly until rwer two hundred
girls were 1'( ‘ed, mostly in
the two-y .ourse. This
course was found unsuited to
the high grade of work aimed
at, so after 1913 the three and
four—year courses were estab-
lished. Different subjects have
been added from time to time
to increase the scope and
efﬁciency, until now there are

 

 

$1.50 PER YEAR

twenty—nine individual courses,
many of advanced type. The
number of instructors has been
augmented, likewise. Of these,
Mrs. Frear, Miss Wilson, Miss
Van Liew and Miss Lantz
remain. This force is now
wholly inadequate, as there is
immediate need for a super—
visor of girls who are practice
leaching, and for :1 Domestic
Science specialist to relieve
h'liss Van Liew. '

In the men’s department, in
addition to the original two.
year course. there were taken
on the four-year course leading
to the ll. S. degree; the one—
yenr course open to skilled
mechanics desiringT to teach
one subject: the three-year
romierative course, in which
the students work alternate
half~days in college classes and
lnlmratories, and in the Con-
solidated Car Heating Co.
shops.

in 1915 courses in plumbing,
sheet metal and electric wiring
were established with Mr.
()lsen as instructor under l’rof.
Douglas’ supervision. About
the same time, Mr. Randall, in
rrunieration with Mr. Kennedy
of the Chemistry Department,
founded a course in the chem-
istry, metallurgy, and heat
treatment of steel. Previous to
