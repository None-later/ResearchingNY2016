Continued from Page I.
this Mr. Randall had equipped
srx
worth of

thousand dollars

'machines necessary for ﬁrst

claSs instruction. From
Thatcher Bros. space was
rented in their foundry for In-

'struction in molding, and now

the entire course in foundry
practice is in this commercial
foundry.

in mm arrangements were
made with the Blakeslee Sash,
Door & Blind Co. for advanced
students to spend half a day
each week in their factory to
promote familiarity with
special woodworking machin-
cry.

l,‘crhaps the most important
of all changes made since the
beginning arc the outside

aililiations in the form of ex-‘

tension work. in the early
days of thc dcpartmcut young
women were sent to teach in
the South End , Settlement,
Trinity Church Scttlcmcnt and
(iirls’ Club. Later Y. W. C. A.
was included in lunch room
and cookcry‘work. A recent
development is the conserva-
tion kitchen in the ‘City Hall.
Classes from Milne High
School were taught in the
H. Ii. Department’s classrooms
and kitchen. Classes for men
in woodworking were also
formed in -Milnc High School,
but the ﬁrst practice teaching
ol'l'crcd to men outside the
building was in the 1Manual
'l‘rainingr Department of
Schools Eleven and Twenty-
iuur. in the basement of School
'I‘umnty-four. This was in
1912. thrco years before the city
schmls maintaincd such a
course. Mr. Davey, er.
O’Brien and the principal of
Fchool Twenty-live then sup-
ported this practice teaching
unit without expense to the
city. Prof. Smith remembers
oitcn having to help carry
material in sacks or baskets to
thcsc schools, in order to have
means for continuing the
course.

There arc now thirty¥cight
girls and nine men during the
day, and thirteen men in the
evening, obtaining their
practice teaching through co—
operation at those in charge of
the city schools. Some are
doing this work in the Albany
Orphan Asylum and St. Vin-
cent's. Others have been paid
for teaching in the Troy Boys’
Club. Also teaching is being
done in a rural school on the
Schenectady-Albany road.

The Home Economics De-
partment, after failing to obtain
permission to start a lunch
room in the Education Build-
ing. started one at college.
This has been successful and
self-supporting. Also, in-
dependent of the State as far

 

as daily upkeep is concerned,
the large Practice ‘House at
429 Washington. Avenue was
leased by Prof. Smith, who is
personally responsible for ex-
penses incurred. Here one
teacher resides with ﬁve girls
at a time throughout the year.
Each Senior must spend four
weeks in the house, doing her
share of the management and
helping to pay expenses.

The night school, established
by Prof. Smith in 1912. is in—
teresting and important. A
two-year evening trade train-
ing course is offered to prepare
skilled mechanics to teach in
trade and industrial schools.
Practice teaching is given in
evening classes run by the city
and in apprenticeship classes
run by the college at city cx-
pcnse. There are now twenty-
two graduates of this course
teaching in the United States,
and at prescnt twenty~four men
registered for the year 1917-18.

The graduating class in
Home Economics in June, [917,
numbered twenty-ﬁve. Of
these twenty have been placed
in positions. The demand for
mcn is so overwhelmingr that
not only was every graduate of
the day and night schools
placed, but also every man who
had taken even a partial course.

Mr. Smith has therefore, in
seven years, dcvclopcd the
School of Practical Arts from
a scrics of empty, unequippcd
rooms, into an eﬂ‘icicntly
organized, and well managed
department, of which State
College is justly proud.
Students in the school feel that
with Mr. Smith gone there will
be a bigr void in the organiza—
tion. but they are all hopingr
that it will be filled as
cﬂiciently in the future as it has
bccn to date.
