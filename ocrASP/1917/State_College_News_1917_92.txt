VICTORY
FOR UNDER
CLASSMEN

First Football Game of Season

The first football game of this
season between the Upper Class
team and the Under Class team
resulted in a victory for the lat
ter with a score of 2—0. .lt was
a hard-fought game and a very
good sample of what the fellows
will be able to do after more
practice.

The Upper Classmen scored
their two points on a safety dur—
ing the third period, when Gor-
don tackled Walker and threw
him over the Upper Classmen's
goal line. At this time Gordon
was slightly injured. but rallied
his Scotch grit and stuck it out.
Walker, Cnrtin and I'larry were
undoubtedly the stars.

The student body and faculty
were represented at the game.
but the side lines were by no
means crowded. The fellows
wantto know that the college
students are backing them up in
their efforts to develop football
as a State College game. Come
over to Ridgeﬁeld Park this Sat-
urday and add your support.

Raymond Oscar l.ud‘wiek. of
.Class '20. died in the hospital at
Gettysburg, where he had been
in training. He was one of our
ﬁrst young,r men to enlist.

 

 

 

 

NEW YORK STATE COLLEGE FOR VTEACl-‘IERS
ALBANY, N. Y., NOVEMBER 7, 1917

OUR FIRST OPPORTUNITY

After preliminary announce—
ments, the conduction of Student
Assembly on November 2d was
given over by Joseph Walker of
Senior Council to I'rof. John
Sayies.

Prof. Sayles' sincere, direct
appeal presented the. proposition
of raising State College's share
of the million—dollar Student
Friendship War Fund. Briefly
he enumerated the purposes of
the [fund—to build hostess
houses near U. S. army1 canton-
ments in this country, to propa—
gate Y. M. C. A interests at
home and abroad, and to better
prison camps abroad. Accounts
come back from across the water
of men sleeping in the stable
with cattle, in cots placed so
closely together that there is no
space between. To nights such
as this and to days of gruelling
drill, Y. M. C. A. brings the one
touch of sunlight. Arthur Guy
Empey, in his remarkable book.
“ Over the Top," speaks of Y. M.
C. A as the only home the sol—
dier has. It goes into shell tire
with him; it provides hooks, ree-
reation, hot coffee, paper and
postage, warmth, dryness and
shelter. The men who have gone
across are takng care of our

line. Italy and Russia have
failed. lirance, England and the
United States cannot fail. It is

a privilege to bring to the br 's
“ over there " the only American
touch which will ﬁnd them.
Miss Kyle Adams, State Sce—
ret'try of Y. W. C. .»\.. was then
introduced by Prof. Sayles, and
spoke with deep feeling. Miss
Ad'nns regards the raising of the
[Fund as the biggest challenge
which students have yet received.
and one to which they must
measure up. The sole and most
inn'ortart aim of the campaign
is not to raise the needed money.
but rather to touch the lives of
those who are privileged so that
they “may give because they have
seen and felt. and in giving thus
pain a clearer and deeper concep»
tion of the- war. This effort to
interest college students every—
where hrts the emphatic sanction
of coileee presidents tln'imvhout
the United States. The i’und
will he devoted to the most hu-
manitarian work possible. regard»
less of creed. Not a small por-
tion of the Fund will be utilized
to help the women in the war.

 

one phase of which will be the
hostess houses. The students of
America must so ﬂy the flag of
friendship that the enemy can-
not tire any more because of the
flood of brotherhood expressed.

Mr, Gallmvay, State Secretary
of Y. M. C. A., was then pre-
sented. He spoke of the preva—
lent‘ inability to comprehend the
numbers of men who are bearing
arms. fighting, (lying. These men
beg for, Y. M. C. A, representa-
tives to keep up their morale.
Everyone wisth to do srnnethingr
for men of other nations, as well
as our own. The only means of
dong this is through Y. M .,
since it. is the only organization
working to—day in all the Allied
Nations.

The privilege of receivingr a
pledge card was extended to
everyone at the close of the meet-

ing.
