| OFFICIAL NOTICES I

Dr. Hathaway will begin the
physical examination of the
members of the Sophomore class
during the week. Sophomores
should consult the ofﬁcial bulletin
for their appointment hours.

Work in Physical Education I
and 2 for men and women in the
Freshman and Sophomore classes
has begun, and all Freshmen and
Sophomores not formally ex-
cused are required to take the
work. Any student subject to
this requirement who may have
been overlbokcd in the assign-
ment of sections should see Miss
Gray or Mr. Maroney at once.
Assignments will be found on the
ofﬁcial bulletin board.

 

Some caution to students con—
cerning the use of corridors
seems necessary. While classes
are in session the common inter-
est demands that quiet be pre-
served in the corridors. This is
especially trite of the ﬁrst tloor
of the main building, where so
many students are obliged to
congregate. Instructors as well
as the students in the classes are
entitled to the thoughtful con-
sideration of those in the cor—
vidors.

ITEMS OF INTEREST

 

Dean Ilorncr will deliver two I
addresses before the Columbia
County 'I‘eachcrs’ Association at:

on Russia on last Tuesday even-
ing was well attended. His next

day 'evcnin§:, .November t4.
Thereafter, if interest in the lee-
tures is strong, Mrs. De Forte
will lecture every two weeks on
Russian literature, Dr. De Porto
alternating with her on Russian
history. A class in the study of
Russian language was organized
