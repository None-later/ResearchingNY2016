MARY A. SMITH

The new supervisor of I’rac-
tice Teaching in the II. l3. De—
partment is Miss Mary Alma
Smith. rMiss Smith is a grad-
uate of State College for
'I‘eaehers of Colorado. She has
taught in the University of
Porto Rico and in theftatc
University of Idaho, and was
recently connected with State
Department of .Iidncation of
\A'iseonsin.

On Friday afternoon, No-
vember ninth, Miss llonnie
Fnow of Milliurn.  Y., gave
a most interesting lecture in
the Science Iluilding' on “ The
Correlation of Ifine Arts with
Home Economics.” Miss Snow
is the author. with Hugh liroe-
lick, of the industrial Art text
books published by f’rang, Ac-
companying her lecture was a
decidedly attractive and in—
genius exhibit, of especial in-
terest to teachers in its sug-
gestion of simple Ways of

 

approaching children. Those
present were graduates of the
II. Ii. Department teaching
within a short distance of Al—
bany. several Art teachers from
Schenectady. rep  .ntatives
of the State Department and
the resident ll. 17.. faculty and
students. Miss Snow laid
special stress on Costume De-
sign. llousc Decoration, and
stilclu'ry in design. Fhe urged
Jhe making of articles which
are instructive. useful. and
beautiful rather than those
which complete a problem
alone. Articles made by hand
should find a place in the deco-
ration of house or costume, In
presenting problems for chil-
dren to work upon, supply
materials which are quickly
\vrn'ked up and yet present the
required color qualities. As an
example of this wool for em~
broidering is much more desirv
able than silk or cotton lloss.
belt and paper applied on
proper backgrounds are charm—
ing mediums for gaining real
artistic effects in color and line.
Miss Snow illustrated her lee--
tiire with samples of work
done by children in an i'n'dinary
school, and thus proved con—
elnsively that this work can be
planned so as to be suitable to
small children.

GYM Home

The frolic Friday night was
by far the most enjoyable one
C. A. A. has ever given. 1921
was certainly treated to a
grand show. First. in order
was the peanut hunt, which
was followed by a lollypop
song and- scramble. The ﬁrst
of the stunts was a short series
of sou-gs by the Back. Fence
Glee Club. The ,' selections
were witty, new and highly
entertaining. The second
stunt, under the leadership of
Iillen Donahue, was a panto—
mime. The leading part—that
of a batehelor advertising for
a housekeepcr—was very ex-
cellently _taken by Dorothy
Wight. In succession. an lrish
washerwoman. a society lady. a
siilTi'11gist. a silly young thing,
and a college girl applied. The
last was chosen and won the
man’s affection.

The third stunt was the dis-
play oi the family album. This
was in charge of Katherine
McCarthy. who also acted the
part of interpreter oEthe “ still
life ” portraits. The girls are
to be commended for, their
skillful make-up as well asifor
their control.

The final stunt. under the
leadership of Agnes Dennin.
was a basketball game between
ll.  and A. II. The former
won the hard fought game of
I2 to ‘10. ll. S. led the ﬁrst
half and A. R. apparently.-
eould not get the ball' the
second half. Miss Gray was
referee. . . . V

Dancing followed. Kathryn
(Tole led cheers and songs for
G. A. A. leaders. Miss Pierce
disappeared at the time a
speech was requested and Miss
liray tried to follow suit but
failed. I'Ier speech was short
and to the point: “Join G!
A. A. and you will get all‘that
is coming to you—and a little
bit more.” Dorothy Austin;
president of G. A. A., sp'oke 
few words of greeting t'ol't'h'e
Freshmen and the line for
adjournment was formed.

Those of the Faculty present
were Miss Pierce.» Miss Gray,
Miss liarnham. and 'Miss Vals
entine. The cmnmittee in
charge was Katherine Me-
Carthy, chairman; Agnes Denv
nin, and Ellen Donahue.
