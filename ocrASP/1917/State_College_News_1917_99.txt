COLLEGE CLUB

At the last meeting, “our
friend,” Dr. Richardson, Spoke
on ” Home Factors in the War."
He declared that sentimental
Americanism should not blind
our eyes to the greatness of
other nations. The two prin-
ciples on which states have
been founded of the ages are:
First, the state is for the
people; second, the people are
tools of the state.

He said that the later policy
has been rognant in Germany
for several centuries. That is
the principle we are. lighting.
The German state is medieval

 

in foundation, resembling the
feudal organization of olden
tunes. The most striking thing
that Dr. Richardson said was
that a reorganization of Ger-
many into a republic would be
possible only after uncondi-
tional surrender, reparation,
and indemnity. ’Vththcr we
win or not depends on every
one of us. We must back up
our soldiers with every dollar
we have.
