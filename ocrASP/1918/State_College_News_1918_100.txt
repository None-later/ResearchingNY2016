THE SIGNIFICANCE OF
THE CASUALTY LIST

Of the hundreds of readers of
the daily casualty list who anxious-
ly search for a familiar name, then
turn away with a sigh of relief, or
who foolishly and inancly exclaim
at the frightful length of the list.
how many see the hidden signiﬁ—
cance of the roll of America’s hon-
or men?

Each day the report contains
such names as Brown, Wellington,

 

t.- Claire, Devercaux, .l’ulaski,
Berenstein, Mailioncy, O'Brien,
Douglass, Contento and Schwin-

(lclbaum. A rapid glance over the
list shows a name representative
of practically every nation in the
world—all ﬁghting together as
brothers in a common cause.

While these men are Americans,
still the blood of other nations
flows in their veins, and, through
countless generations, their fann-
ilies have been loyal to other na-
tions and other principles. But
now tribal or racial differences are
forgotten in the concentration of
effort for general principles—prin-
ciples which concern all men, rc-
gardlcss of the individual. These
men have proven themselves ready
to make the supreme sacriﬁce to
light together for the common
goal

Is there not, then, grounds for
the hope that ﬁghting Europe may
some day be tinted in a common
effort to reach a common goal?
Is the analogy too far fetched to
be used? The answer is, plainly,
no. Just as men alone have for-
gotten the bitterness of the past, so
can nations forgive and forget in
the supreme sacriﬁce that peace
and prosperity may come.

A GOOD SIGN

 

One of last year’s, graduatesp

who returned for a visit during the
. ast week, was heard to remark:
‘I don’t know.what’s the matter
with.people; they’re too industri-
ous even to VlSll."'

Have you noticed ‘it we? One.

does not see so many people stand-
ing about the halls or stairwnys or

e New York State,

 

sitting on the beiiclies-—tnerely
idling away time—just visiting.
All about the place the familiar
khaki bespenks 'action, service,
striking the keynote for the entire
atmosphere of college. Knitting
needles lly, and girls who aren't
knitting are busy, too. Class work
seems to progress more rapidly.
Some professors have said they
had to work hard to keep ahead
of their classes. Industry. pros-
pers everywhere.

he lessons of the war are
many. Each day new ones appear.
Not only colleges, as other groups
of people, but also individuals feel
and manifest the slow but sure
evolution of characteristics—an
evolution resulting from the war.
The change is for the better. You
have heard the remark that the
folks back home will have to work
hard to be worthy of the boys
when they return. Though the
preparation may not be startling,
it is none the less certain in its
forward movement.

Never was Tenuyson's immortal

" yet we trust that some-
how good will be the final goal
of ill”
more fervently uttered than during
the days through which we have
passed and are passing. And,
through the darkness there can be
seen the faint signs of the dawn of
the day when " good will be the
ﬁnal goal of ill."

it is poor patriotism that up»
plauds the flag, hisscs pictures of
the kaiser, and fails to buy a Lib-
erty Bond. The ﬂag is deserving
of all reverence and respect; the
kaiser is a ﬁt subject for hissing;
but the business of this war is
ﬁghting. There are two classes of
ﬁghters—the boys abroad and the
dollars at home. if you can’t go,
draft your dollars. They are
needed.

 

The United States of America is
the richest corporation in the
world. Yet it still is possible to
purchase a share of it'. The price
is kept at par. A ‘dollar a week will
start the investment. If you want
a mortgage on the wealth of the
American continent and a share in
the task of making the world fit to
live in, invest! Agents of the
Fourth Liberty Lord will explain
the details.

Fight or buy bonds! Many
Americans are doing both. Many
others are not able to ﬁght—but
they can save money to buy bonds.
buying bonds is practical patriot-
ism, plus proﬁt.

The best celebration of Ameri-
can victories abroad is the pur-
chase of Liberty Bonds. .Thcy
make the ultimate triumph pos-
Sible.

DOES THIS APPLY TO
YOU?

It is a matter of great incon-
venience to many that some Stu-
dents allow mnil addressed to them
to collect in the mail box in the
basement at the foot of the main
stairs. The room in the compart-
ments of the box is limited at best,
but when taken up with week~old
letters it becomes an unknown
quantity. In these times we should
endeavor to save'the other fellow
as much tronblc‘as possible. Get
into the habit of looking over the
mail every day or so. You may
ﬁnd unimportant letter for your-
self, who knows? In any case,
you will no doubt save someone
else much exasperation.

 

QUERY

Where is last year’s music 3 class
that promised Professor Balding
they'd return this fall for the pro-
duction of “ The Japanese Girl,"
which was unable to be presented
last spring? We have the music
learned. Let’s rush through the
few rehearsals necessary for the
presentation of this extremely
clever operetta and make of it a
great success. Remember, you
students of last year's music 3
class, you gave your wordl

HOME ECONOMICS
DEPARTMENT

 

The Home Economics Practice
House is located at 45 South Lake
avenue, and will be occupied by its
ﬁrst group of resident girls Sunday,
Oct. 13.

For the beneﬁt of those not ac-
quainted with the House, let it be ex~
plaiucd that it is a means by which
the Seniors of the Department can
carry out in practice the theories
which they have imbibed during their
four years here. Practical work in
planning and serving meals, in acting
as hostess, in caring for the fur-
nace—in fact the entire management
of the home is carried out by the
girls. The Department is most for-
tunate in securing so efﬁcient and
sympathetic a House Director as
Miss Eva Wilson, a member of the
Home Economics faculty. The girls
of the Department consider them-
selves favored to be able to live un—
der the ideal home management su-
pervised by Miss Wilson.

Each girl of the Home Economics
Department has an opportunity to
spend four weeks in the house during
her Senior year. The ﬁrst group to
live there this year are Harriet
Church, ‘19; Amelia Gosicr, ’19;
Fanne Plusch, ’19; Erma Baldwin,
'19; Satie Winne, ’19.

 

 

At tea Sunday evening, Sept. 29th,
after a guessing competition, the
names of the several rooms of the
Dormitory, at 390 Ma son avenue,
were divulged by their owners. Such
names as “Blighty,” "No ‘Man’s
Land," and “Anti-Blues," wlule ap-
propriate, proved very balliim.r to the
contestants. As guests of the even-
ing were Miss Van Licw, Miss
Wilson and illiss Tuttle.

The Dormitory entertained Miss
Eunice Pcrinc at dinner Thursday
evening, Oct. 3. V

The girls living at the Dormitory
are: Seniors, Satic anc, Amelia
Uosicr, Marion Curtis, Mary Ann
llardcnlmrgh, lidna Woodward, Ger—
aldine Jennings, Grace Hunt Beulah
Hunt, Grace Uriffen, Mildred Hoteli—

Elizabeth Ferguson, ’18, \vasua rc—
ceut visitor at College. Miss l‘crgu-
son has completed her course in di—
ctctics at Long island Collegehl’srook-
lyn, and will now take a position at
Nathan Littaucr Hospital, Glovers-
ville, N. '. 1

Marion Peterson, ’18, and Rachael
f-Iendrickson, ’18, are studying at
Long Island Hospital, Brooklyn, N.Y.

The Seniors of the Department
have entered upon their practice
teaching. Miss Mary Smith, of the
faculty, acts as critic.

Several Juniors of the Department
are teaching in Trinity and South
find Settlements, and at the Girls'
Club. This teaching docs not give
any collcgc credit and is purely vol-
untary. lt nllortls, however, valua—
hlc experience to aid subsequent
practice teaching. Juniors are also
assisting Miss Madge liloodgood in
prcparini,r and serving meals in the
War Kitchen.

CHEMISTRY CLUB

The ﬁrst meeting of the Chemistry
Club for the year will he held on Fri~
day afternoon, Oct. 11, 1918, at 4:10
in room 250. Current topics in chem-
istry and a consideration of plans for
the growth of the Club for the year
will be discussed.

The Club has lost a large number
of members through graduation and
induction into the service, and as
there is but a small list of eligible stu—
dents, the increase will probably be
small. However, such a condition
will make little difference in the
Club’s program, as “ Quality, not
quantity," has always been the motto.

It is planned to erect an Honor
Roll, in the near future, to those
members of the Club who are in the
service of the government. With
the probable exception of the frater-
nities, Chemistry Club can boast .u
larger percentage of its membersm
service than any other organization
in the College. Of this fact It is
justly proud, and will endeavor
throughout the year to show how cs-
scntial chemistry is to the successful
completion of the war.
