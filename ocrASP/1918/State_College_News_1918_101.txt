fiance?"

Liza pondered a moment, then
lieiit over the tub mice more, “ N0,
mai'am," she said, "lt ain't been
in the wash yet."

A Japanese schoolhoy's compo-
silinii on the cat: "The cat is lit—
tle cattle. When first she secs a
rat she illuminates her eye."

"’[‘onmiy, isn't it rather an ex—
travagance to eat both butter and
jam on your bread at the same
time."

“ No, Iua'am, it’s economy. The
same piece of bread docs for
bot I."

The teacher was taking a class

"It had ears, but could not—"

" Hear,” was the answer.

could iiot—"

“Speak,” once more replied the

‘Wipc it,” shouted the children.

Essay on Pants

l‘alits are made for men and not
for women. Women are made for
men and not for pants. l'alits are
like molasses; they are thinner in
hot weather and thicker itt cold
weather. There has been much
discussion as to whether pants is
singular or plural. Seems to us
that when men wear pants it is
plural, and when they don't wear
pants it is singular. if you want
to make pants last, make the coat
first.

The new recruit walked into the
orderly room and made himself at
home with the clerks there.

“ ay, who is the (lateral Staff I
hear so much about these days?
see his name in the pape almost as
much as General . hiiig's. [never
heard of him before.”
" lc's a son of Major Operations,”
said the sergeant-iiiajm‘.

“And a brother to Corporal 'llun»
ishmeiit,” said the post corporal.

“Also a cousin to Private lin—
trance," said the orderly clerk as he
threw him nul. “ Didn't you see their
names on the door as you came in? ”

A girl was asked to parse “kiss,”
and this was the result:

" This word is a noun, but it is
usually used as a conjunction. It is
never declined and is more common
than proper. It is not very singular,
in that it is usually used in the plural.
It agrees with me.” ‘

Professor Walker, in a chilly class-
room: "Any teacher when given real
responsibility should be as cool as we
are this minute."
