dressing station. Every man that
goes into action carries a ﬁrst-aid
dressing sewed in the lining of his
coat. The statement that the Can-
adians had insufﬁcient dressin s is
untrue. Your work of the Red ross
shows to the greatest adVantage at
the advance dressing stations: The
men when brought in are sufferin a
great deal from expOSure, but a ter
a change of clothing, and a cigarette,
Tommy is perfectly happy. The ﬁrst
question he generally asks is, ‘Am
busted u enough to go to Blighty
(Londonllp If the doctor says he
is; Tommy immediately begins to joke
about his wounds. One fellow who
came in Well peppered with shrapnel,
was asked how he received his
wound. 'Well,’ he said 'I saw a can
of sardines in front 0 the captain's
dugout and I went after it. When I
was coming back a shell exploded
and blew the can right out of my
hand. I wouldn't have cared a hang
it I hadn’t have taken all that trouble
to get the thing.I ’

“At the station, the wounds are ex-
amined. They used to pour pure
iodine in the raw wounds, but
now they‘have something else that is
more soothing. The danger of
wounds lies, on account of the highly
fertilized soil, in the contraction of
tetanus. So the stretcher bearer tn-
jccts an anti-tetanus scrum into the
wounded men, afterwards marking
their foreheads with the letter T With
an indelible pencil to show that the
men have been inoculated. The men
hate this inoculation and swear pro-
fusely. I had just inoculated one fel-
low und had turned ’i'ound to do the
same to a wounded German when I
felt a tug at my coat as I bent down.
and, turning, I asked the fellow what
the matter was. He didn’t answer,
so I bent over the German again. An-
other tug at my coat. ‘Well,’ I said,
‘what is it? What can 1 do for
you?’ The follow answered, ‘Say,
how much will you take to let my
jab that into him? ’

“A medical card, waterproof, is
buttoned inside the coat pocket, On
it is written the man's name, regi-
ment. whether previously Wounded,
when given morphine, and Whether
inoculated. 'This is put into an en-

' velope and sent with the man to the
next dressing station 50 that the
wounded man is not bothered to an-
swer a- lot of questions. Generally,

 

the wounded man is asked of what
religion he is. ha y I asked a
wounded man his religion. 'Oh,’ he
said, wearily 'Roman Catholic,
Church of lingland Presbyterian,
trench mortar or mac inc gunl'

“In a war ambulance, there is
room for four stretcher cases and
two walking cases. When the wound-
ed arrive at the station, it there
is no necessity to change the dress-
ings, the men are rushc to the C. C.
5. and attended to there by special-
ists.

“Up in the salient we had an ad-
Vancc station in a sand-bagged but
which was safe from riﬂe ﬁre ant
shrapnel fragments. There we gath-
ered our wounded, and worked at
night. Then we would rush the
wounded out to a narrow gauge rail-
way, put them on trucks and rush
them to the ambulances. Fritz had
an eye on this track, and had ma-
chine guus trained on us, but we
never had one casualty.

“In his front line trenches, oppo—
sitc ours, Fritz was always putting up
placards with messages that he was
going to do something to the Cana-
diansdu June. No one paid much
attention to these, but on the second
of June Fritz opened up a terriﬁc
honibartmcnt. Two hundred and
ﬁfty cannon were trained on us. The
casualties amounted to thirty thou»
sand. The Germans took our front
line by surprise and went on to
Calais. There Fritz hesitated, when
he had the road open, and this was
his undoing, for reserves came up
and the Germans were swept out of
the territory they had gained. These
reserves were composed of English
and Scotch soldiers. Although this
Victory was attributed to the Cana-
dians, it would have been impossible
had it not been for the reserves. The
English soldier has no equal. Tommy
is a splendid tighter and the best
sticker you could ever wish to ﬁnd.

“In the stretcher hearers' squad
no man was allowed to sleep until
he was thoroughly exhausted. He
was obliged to work day and night.
Some of the wounded Iiad been lying
in the rain for three days and when
they were picked up, they were found
with maggots alive in their wounds.

“Now, in regard to gas attacks.
Fritz has two methods. One is the
cloud, and the other the shells. The
ﬁrst he used when the wind was
blowing in the direction of our
trenches. He has pipes laid out
along the ground and when the con-
ditions are favorable he releases the

gas. As soon as the gas-guard, who
is on duty continually, hears a hissing
sound at night, or sees a cloud roll-
ing along the ground in the day,
he sends out a warning to put on the
gas masks. The artillery immediately
begins tiring into the cloud on ac-
count of a possible attack from Fritz.
“II should like to, correct an erro-
iicous statement about Canadians not
taking prisoners. The Canadians
know what regiments are opposite
them, and if these i'cgii’rients are
guilty of atrocities to any of our com-
rades they have no mercy on Fritz,
but ﬁght him to the death. Let me say
that the Saxons have never been
known to have committed any atroci-
tics,"
