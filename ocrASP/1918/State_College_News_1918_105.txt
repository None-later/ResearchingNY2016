WELCOME BACK!

welcome to faculty and students

longed quarantine. With victory

THE MIRACLE

 

All through the long and dark
four years, since August, 1914, the
peoples of the allied nations—and
who knows but that the same has
been truc among the [Inns—have
lonng and prayed and hoped for
peace, but each succeérliivr,r day and
year 1136 seemed to make the and
seem farther away. The foremost
critics and prophets have had noth—
1m,r for inquirers but promises of
years of struggle ahead. The only
hopeful words have become “A
miracle will surely happen."

When the news of surrender
came on Thursday last it seemed
the miracle had happened. The
contradiction of the report brought
genuine sorrow to many, and
quenched the fires of enthusiasm
which ignited at a moment's notite
all over the wrirlrl. But a hope had
been born ~—- a hope so constant and
strong and true that faith in thc ul-
timate glouous victory waxed
stronger each hour.

\thn the ofﬁcial announcement
rang out through the darkness of
early Monday morning the nation-
wide response was characteristi-
cally American. Parades, noise,
joy, prayer ruled the (lay. Truly
the miracle had come.

Amid the hilarity and expres—
sions of thankfulucss there has
been the undcrcurrcut of doubt of
the sincerity of the Hun signature.
\Vc fear the “ Kamerad " stunt be—
cause we have learned the trick.

But it is up. to us to trust the allied‘

representatives. Their sincerity in
the belief in our enemies in this
new move cannot be questimicd.
Our caution is natural and typically
patriotic, but underneath it all let

us have faith that thcdivine miracle-

has come.

 

S'l.‘A'l‘l?. C(i)l.1.l£(iil§£ NEWS, NOVEMBER 14, 1918

To Albany Law Students:

Although a bit late, due to nn~
avoidable circumstances, the
"News" is none the less sincere
in t‘xlcllt‘llllK to Law School men 01
the S. A. '1‘. C. a hearty welcome
from State College.

In ‘hc past the relationship be—
twccn these two 1111])0‘.Ellll.' Schools
of the Capital City has been too dis—
tant. This was not due to en—
mity, but to neglect, The war,
with its immediate needs, has at
last brought a proper feeling,r of
friendship between the two schools.
State opens wide licr arms to quar-
ter Law men as hi‘otl ,l‘s with her
own sons of the S. A. 1‘. (1., and
Law is sure to respond wholeheart—
edly in the new relationship. Al-
rt-udy she has adopted the Fresh-
man rce’ulantion. used by Stale and
has shown her "if ready for scr-
vicc licsidc the men of her adopted
,\lnia Mater.
lloth Law and State men alike have
shared in the joys of camp life and
have borne equally the hard
things impost upon all soldi ‘s.
lloth men have stood shoulder to

 

 

 

shouldcr in tho c:er of the sick of

both schools, united by a strong
bond of sympathy and human kind-
iiess.

Sn. throughout. tht var these men
shall stand together, forgetting that
a dividing line ever existed, And it
is certain In follow that after the
war Albany Law School anrl State
College shall never allow the few
paces bclu'ccn the respective build-
ing's to cause neglect of the broth~
crly relations between the two cob
lcgcs.

(lure again. then, thrice welcome,
Alba-Hy Law!

 

 

. A SHINING EXAMPLE

The value of lilt‘ student tax at
State College can well be illustratcd
by a condition which has arisen at
out- of the largest of our sister uni—
vcrsilics of the Empire State. At
this college the individual sub-
scription stem is used. and is the
only nit-ans of financial support
(outside of ads), for the college
publication. The board of editors
of the daily have decided that it
will be necessary to have 1500 sub-
scribers or the publication of the
paper must cease. After a vigorous
campaign the managers I'eporl that
it is practically impossible to get
subscriptions owing’ to hard times
amt uncertain conditions. Thus it
is probable that the paper will be
discontinued.

How different here at Sta-tel The
student tax fund supplies the neces-
sary money and the " News" and
Echo appear regularly, liven dur-
int,r these hard times the student
press organs are issued on time
and continually hclp State College
grow.

There is a moral connected with
this story. l-[ccd it, one and all!

f yr-u haven’t paid your 1018—19
blanket tax, shell out $5.00 Nt'll-V!

    

To the Editor of the News Board:

it occurred to me the other day
that inasmuch as there is going to
be a nation-wide campaign on Fri-
day, November 15, for music (rec—
ords, plionograplis), for the soldiers
and sailors, it would only be fitting
that State College take an active in—
terest in this as she alwa-y's has
done in patriotic projects. if every
student in State would contribute
ten cents, or more if he wishes, to
a siccial college fund. A Victor
ltllklng‘ machine could be pur-

 

chasedand the remainder of the
money spent for records. ()1
course. this drive must have the
eo-opcration of every student, and
considering there are over (1111] here,
we ought to be able to put the [111111;
through with a Great .llig l'ushl
And may 1. be allowed to stigncsl.
Mr. Editor, that, the “ News"
board he made the head of this
drive? hope that this plan will
meet willi your approval and that
a drive. will he made that will be a
splendid succc‘s. M’ZO.
