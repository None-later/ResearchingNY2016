EDITORIALS
ARMISTICE IDEAL

News comes from all sources—.-
aibroad, home training- camps, cm-
zen activitics—everywhere the
same, that the signing of the ar-
mistice has brou ht forth a dc»
cided cessation 0 war work. It
seems the tendency is to lay off—
to ease up, The soldiers are re—
ported to be thinking now of the
home coming instead of the DVCF
seas trip. Citizens are reported to
be failing to buy war savings
stamps and to have stopped pay-
ments into the War Chest, lied
Cross, Yu M. C. A and K. of C
funds.

To be true, this reaction is only
human—and "we’re only poor,
weak mortals after all"—~but we
have learned through the past
hard months to work and have
forgotten how to rest on our oars.
The spirit, attitude and actions of
the American public have merited
world-wide praise and :ulmiration.
Efﬁcient service has become the
American ideal—and Americans
have lived up to their ideal.

The fact that hostilities have
ceased and that [)‘act: is in sight
is no reason for relinquishing our
ideal. .Beyond any question the
(lays ahead are to be the most try-
ing ones since August, 1914. With
reconstruction ahead the only pos—
sible slogan is ” EiiiCiCllt Service."
It is expected that America, who
has suffered least. will sacrifice
most in the stupendous task. it is left
for America to ﬁght on now—it is
left for her to atone for the two
.and a half years of her inactivity
:at the opening of the war. Her
experience after the Civil War pe~
culiariy fits her for the present
needs. But the work is to be in-
ﬁnitely greater.

This country's position among
world powers is due to the per-
fect ctr-operation of its millions of
individuals. Otherwise, such

topian transformations could
never have come, Every person
has saved and served to the limit
and then has saved and served
more. And each individual is go-
ing to pick up the battle and light
as he never has fought before.
Once more each one will take up
the slogan. “Eﬁicicnt Service,"

Europe and its forgotten battle-
