SAILORS WIN
BASKETBALL GAME

luniors Attend Game In a Body

State met the strongest team
that has appeared against them
this season, Saturday evening,
it being composed of some of the
best intercollegiate and profes-
sional players in the country.

State College did not play up to
usual form. Several of the players
passed the ball wildly and were
unable to hold it after taking a
pass. The sailors took advantage
of all these blunders and many
counted for field baskets.

After about two minutes of play
in lhe opening half llarry dribbled
the ball the length of the court
and scored the first field basket of
the game. Wakefield put the
sailors on even terms with the [\l-
hanians by scoring from under the

basket, ll. O'lloyle followed a
minute later with another field
basket, llarry again dribbled the

ball the length of the court and.
scored, tieing the score. Cohen.
took a pass from Barry under the
basket and scored, putting State
College in front again, Fitzgerald
scored from the foul line and gave
the Teachers a three point lead.
Holt-r, Pelham’s big center, scored
two field goals in a row and gave
the visitors the lead again, which
they retained throughout. State
(‘ollege was able to score but one
foul basket during the remainder
of the half. while Wakeﬁeld scored
twice from the foul line and H.
O'Boyfc registered a ﬁeld basket.
The score at half time was 12 to 8,
in favor of the Pelham team.

Fitzgerald took the ball on the
tip off on the second half and
scored from the side of the court,
cutting the visitors’ lead down to
two points, The sailors then.cut
loose and State College was out-
classed in all departments. The
visitors passed the ball with light-
ning speed and field baskets were
scored from all parts of the court.
l-lofcr carried the hall all over the
court and proved too big a man
for the State College men to stop.
Every member of the Pelham team
scored from the field in this half.
Ilofer's shooting in this half was
excellent. He caged the ball three
times on spectacular shots. Fitz-
gerald did practically all of the
Teachers' scoring in this half,
getting three ﬁeld goals and two
foul baskets. Cohn came through
with a ﬁeld basket near the end of
the half.

The O‘Boyle brothers, who per-
formed with the Georgetown uni-
versity basketball and football
teams for the last three years,
