Lost from the second term st
lation days due to extension of the
tirst term.

It is thought advisahle ttot to at-
tempt to recover these as the only
ways of doing it are:
' ion of the sprint: ‘e‘ ss. ‘
ion of the tinal examinations.

lixtension oi the college year one
week to June 2 .

()r a combination oi the three.

We feel that the sprint,’ vacation of
one week is a necessity for hotlt the
faculty and students, especially this
year. its the actual teaching work will
have no intertn 5i oi mty kind
frotn Jan. 3 to :\pril 16. To otnit the
recess would mean the teaching wottld
continue front Jan. 3 to May 30.
which is too tom: a period.

The tinal examinations in June
should not he omitted, especially since
the examinations are omitted itt Ian-
nary.

The colleue year should not he ex-
tended to June 23, as this would give
only two weeks" rest hefore the hegin-
nine of the summer session. More-
over. many of the students will he
needed again this year as they were
last year for farm work.
