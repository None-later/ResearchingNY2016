all those who can eat before or

STUDENT ASSEMBLY
Continued from Page 1

Mr. Alling‘ said in part:

“ There are so many things i
should like to tell you that l feel
like an Egyptian mummy —
pressed for time. I was in Wash-
ington when news of the signings
of the armistice came, and as I
stood upon the steps of a buildingr
a soldier came up and said, ‘Say,
it they don’t send us home soon
1'“ put up a bowl that they’ll hear
twenty miles oif.’

“And that is just the spirit of
the boys over there. That great
group of men will put up a howl
that will be heard for 3,000 miles!
And yet it will be over two years
before they can come home.

"I want you to visualize that
army; it is the sight of a lifetime.
There are the great American
made railroads. docks, freight
cars, machine shops, etc., all the
way from the coast to that Front
where our army would have put
the war where it l)elonge(l-—On
German soil. this made a
great impression in France. ‘A
nation that can do this cannot be

 

Illfilli‘ll,’ they said. ‘Thank God
they are our allies.‘ "

strict precautions taken on board

iships going back and forth and
declared we could not give too
much praise to the American

Navy, but for whom our lrmes
never could llll'vt' gotten across.

“:\nd lt‘l us not forget llll' .\I-
lied armies,” Ilt' cautioned. “ lx’e-

“The Germans thought we

or, ‘ " . they got me, but I got

“Are We worthy the sacriliec

Mr. Allint,r then remarked on
the leveling: of classes among" the
boys over there and the disap-
