EDITORIALS .
THANKSGIVING

 

To the student body the "News"
extends cordial good wishes for a
happy 'I‘hanksgiving.

Thanksgiving day, November 28,
1918, is no doubt the most memorable
one for many decades. Since 1914
people have prophesied and hoped
and prayed for peace before Thanks-
giving and the holidays of each year.
And 1918 sees the fulﬁllment of'the
prophecies, the realization of the
hopes and the answering ' of the
prayers of the past four years.

To American forefathers the day
was one of genuine thanksgiving—-
truly a holy day. lint, through the
centuries since the first 'l‘banksgiving
(lay, custom has changed the signiﬁ—
cance of the day to one of jollity and
merrymaking, neglecting the real
meaning of the day.

It cannon be otherwise than that
this week Thursday will assume
much of the character of the early
Thanksgiving days. Mcrrymaking
will take place throughput the land,
but the joy will be tinged with a sin-
cere feeling of gratitude for the peace
which has come. it will be a day of
humble prayers to the Almighty who
has brought victory and peace and
néw hope for the future. it will be a
(rite Thanksgiving (lay.

FORGETTING

It seems the supreme irony of fate,
as displayed in the twentieth century,
that the allied and American nations
are now called upon to consider the
German nation as being once more a
member of the family of nations. It
is irony because of the unspeakable,
inhuman actions of that nation
against the other members of ‘ the
family of world powers.

Already plans for showing mercy,
for offering food, clothing and other
necessities are under way, and the
most uncivilizcd group of peoples in
the world is to be given civil, Chris-
tian treatment. At first it seems un-
fair and impossible, yet it must he so.
The allies and America have been
fighting for Christian principles and
against barbarism for four bitter
years, Now that victory has come on

 

STATE‘COLLEGE NEWS,” NOVEMBER 28,1918

the side of the Right, the winners of
the tight must display the principles
for which they have fought. Perhaps
the most divine of all principles is
that of “forgivin and forgetting,"
yet it is the most ifficnlt one to apply
in real sincority.

It is strange that the first applica-
tion of the rule come between the
lines of enemies abroad. American
papers printed stories of fraterniz-
ing in less than twenty-four hours
after desperate fighting ceased. 'l‘he
bitterness of the struggle was quickly
forgotten by those most concerned.

How we as a nation shall learn to
forgive is not conceivable. To pro-
phcsy how we shall forget is still
more difficult. But both must and
will come in the great plan for the
working out of things—sometime,
somehow.

The question of degree enters here.
Can we absolutely forgive and for-
get, leaving the retribution to the
Divine? Are we superhuman enough
to conquer our desire for "paying in
full"? The Germans must learn a
severe lesson, but not in a spirit of
revenge. Are we going to say'wc
have forgiven and then proceed to
administer huan justice? The final
answer is awaited anxiously by the
whole world.

Whatever he the decision, it re-
mains for us, singly and collectively,
to conscientiously strive to work out
those ideals for which American sons
have fought and bled and (lied, and
which have been won so gloriously.
Perhaps we shall forgive, but shall
we not make the forgiving complete
by forgetting?
