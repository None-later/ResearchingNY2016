STATE COLLEGE GRADU-
ATE DOES INTEREST-
ING WORK IN FRANCE

Kolin finger, a State College grad-
uate and member of the Class of ’17,
is with the Second Pioneer infantry
in France.

For a. period of three months the
Second Pioneers were stationed near
Bordeaux. While there Mr. linger
aided greatly in the entertainments
given at the local "Y." He partici-
pated in several vaudeville shows and
song contests. When last heard from
he was assisting in the direction of a
musical comedy in which he was to
have a leading part.

Before the Second Pioneers moved
from the Bordeaux region Mr. Hagar
was most pleasantly surprised by a
visit from Captain Jesse Jones, cx-'18.

particular. Important? Why not?

hen a college body is going to vote
for a song leader, and the candidates
for the position are all well qualiﬁed
for it, is it a wonder that an atmos-
phere of excitement filled the Audi-
torium? 'Dr. Brubacher and Mys-
lcania were present. Lyra Water-
housc, acting President of 1919,
opened the contest by announcing that
Elizabeth Archibald, Junior candi-
date, would try out first. it is not

necessary to describe the "pep" and
enthusiasm Miss Archibald put into
the songs. Her spontaneity was

 

catching, and everybody sang "Pack
Up Your 'l‘rouhles" as though he or
she meant it. This song was followed
by “A Long, Long Trail.” This, too,
was Well sun , as was "Smiles."
After singing tie chorus of the latter
through twice, it was whistled and
bummed. When it comes to putting
life into a crowd and making things
go with lots of "snap," just leave it
to Betty Archibald. Inasmuch as the
other Junior candidate. Edward
Springman, had withdrawn his name,
Jeanette Relief, one of the represen-
tatives for the Senior class, took the
floor. Owing to the illness of the
other Senior contestant, Hariot Poole,
Miss Rellcr was the only representa-
tive for 1919. She led off the singing
with "America, the Beautiful." This
was follosved by “Keep the Home
[fires Burning." Miss Rellcr hit upon
the unique plan of making Myskania
sing the first verse, with the students
joining in only on the chorus. An
even if Myskania were few and far
between, there was a noble responscl
Evidently the song leader believed in
variety—or should it be said, varia-
tions? f’or, apparently pleased with
the Myskania rendition, she madethe
Frosh sing alone. They did it cred»
itably but politely. Then the Sophs
bad a try-out. They surely could
sing! They raised their fresh young
voices 'till “sure ‘twas a din to fright
a monster"! (Let us not complete
that quotation. else the Sopbs will be-
comc conceited.) Just when the
Juniors Were getting ready to give
the Mosh a lesson in singing and the
Sophs a squelching. the leader an-
nounced that the Juniors would
whistle or hum the chorus. The least
said about this performance the bet«
for, but the Juniors joined all the
more heartily in the final united
chorus as a result of their disap-
pointment. There was no question in
regard to Miss Rellcr's ability to lead
a student body in singing. for she
displayed admirable qualities neces-
sary for a successful leader.

This ended the contest. The re-
mainder of the hour was taken up by
consideration of renppropriation of
part of the Student Tax. This matter
will be voted upon again in the future.

ALBANY MEN LOSE
Continued from Page 1

 

Kline and Scrafford of the Mount
Pleasant aggregation were the stars
of the game. Klein, the quarterback,
was a consistent and gainer and
scored three touchdowns. Bueno,
liarry and Diedrich were the main-
stays of the Army team. The win-
ners gained constantly, their men out—
weighing each of the Army men by
forty pounds.

The ﬁrst period ended 0-0. with the
Mount Pleasant on ,the Army’s 21—
yard line.

The home team lost the ball on the
Army’s l—yard line and Diedrich
kicked from behind his goal. Kline
brought it back to the 17-yard line
before he was downed. Tawney was
hurt, but continued in the game.
Baker got Kline comingr around his
end and stopped him for the fourth
down. Barry was tackled on his 1-
yard line and Diedrich kicked out of
bounds on the 18. With but three
yards to go, Klein carried the ball
over for the first count. White failed
to kick the goal, the ball hitting the
post above the cross bar.

hite kicked off to the Army’s
goal and Barry carried it back
yards before he was brought down.
Diedrich gained three through center
and then lost seven when the Army's
fine failed to hold on a forward pass.
The weight of the Schenectady team
began to tell. and when Dicdrich
kicked to their 40-yard line they car-
ried the ball right down the ﬁeld on
wide end runs. When within three

carried the ball over. White‘s attempt
to kick the goal went wide of its
mark.

Klein broke through for 25 yards,
the longest run of the game. Barry
then intercepted a forward on his 30-
yard line and ran it back 10. The
Army lost the ball when Volkman
blocked Diedrich’s kick. Klein took
the hall for eight yards and fumbled
as he was tackled, Mauserbergcr rc-
covering it. Klein carried it over for

must he kept up. After-war work
dunands constant and enormous con--
tributions. But the present issue in-'
volvcs other considerations. The con-
sensus of opinion is that the S. A. T.
C. will be dcmobilized before Christ-
mas. In that case, college athletics
will boom—and money will be needed.
No one can definitely say that more
than $800 will be needed, but is it
wise to take the chance?

Also, shall we initiate the policy of
re-appropriating funds already set:
aside_for a deﬁnite purpose? How
soon would the student fund thus be
depicted? On the other hand, shall
we fail to make a contribution from
some source to the worthy cause?
