INTERESTING LECTURE
Continued from Page I

 

Dr. Brubacher ﬁrst introduced
Regent Alexander. who has charge
of the ambassador‘s program
while here. The Regent then ex—
plained brieﬂy how the French
nation has sent these distinguished
men to be distributed from coast
to coast and placed at the disposal
of the various universities. The
list of honors and distinguished
offices which Professor Reinach
has held was a long one, among
them being several cditorships of
noted magazines of ancient and
modern art.

Professor Reinavch said in part:
“ All of you have heard of the
horror caused by the Germans in
the cities and towns of France and
Belgium. I know that public sym—
pathy in America is high; and no
sympathy, no pity was ever better
justiﬁed. Never since the days of
the Huns and Vandals of history
have there been such crimes
against civilization and art. It
would seem as if that quotation, ' A
thing of beauty is a joy forever'
has been lost to the German mind.
These ravages you have heard
about are no outbreaks of the un-
disciplined soldier, but are the re-
sults of systematic planning on the

 

‘ her let.

part of those in charge." Pro-
fessor Reinach proved this point
by reading extracts from a Ger-
man magazine, in which the writer
declared that the French army
'must either 0 forward and be de-
stroyed in, Germany, or fall back
into the barren wilderness which
they had deliberately made of
Frantic.

“ We of France have an im-
portant duty—to show how large
was the artistic and historic merit
of our relics. Some of these are
lost forever; only a few will be of
use in the future, which shall ariso
out of bleeding shattered Franco."
Thus Professor .Ix'cinach stated the
ﬁrm hope of his fellow countrymen
and then went on to tell of three
speciﬁc treasures of France: The
Castle of Coucy. the Town Hall of
Arras. and the Cathedral of
,~ eims.

" The Castle of Coucy belonged in
period to the Middle Ages and was
an excellent example of military
Eastern art as brought in by the
Crusaders from Palestine. Its lofty
tower was the highest of its periodw
and now it is a heap of stones. Ger-
many slrove not only to conquer
France,” said Professor Reinach,
“ but to mutilate and destroy her so
that the veneralion and admiration of
other lands should be taken from her.

“ The town hall of Arras, a beauti-
ful structure with its dignified arched
windows and stately bell'ry, is an ex-
ample ol the period when civic spirit
was prominent in the free towns of
the Middle Ages, This structure, too,
is crushed and broken; only here and
there a skeleton wall remains.‘

Concerning the Cathedral of
Rhcims, Professor Reinach said that
he had not the time to enlarge upon
its former beauties and present state
of destruction. It is a matter of great
gricl to France that a building so
rare should he trampled beneath the
sacrilcgions feet of the Hun.

QUEER QUESTIONS

Dear Editor: .I have just been is-
sued my new \voolcns. I put them
on last night and they tickled so
much i, laughed all night and
couldn't sleep. if I don’t get more
rest I will be unable to drill. What
shall I do? Bee V. Dee.

Worried Bee V. Dee: If the situ-
ation is desperate and you must es—
cape from the woolcns, sneak out
some dark night with your rifle and
hold up a moth. he does not
submit, immediately strike him on
the head with the butt of your gun.
Take your prisoner back and stow
him into your woolens. After sev-
eral days he will begin to starve
and will start to eat the underwear.
Let him eat. Messy Editor.

If you can hold your head up while

Are drooping theirs from

If you can drill in dust that clouds

And still be tit to hike another

The long black nights, the lone-
some road, the blues; '
If you can choke back all the
gloomy wishes
0f home that seem to spring
right from your shoes;
If you can laugh at sick call and

\Vhen all the other lads are
checking in;
if you. can kid and jolly all the kill-

If you can grin and snicker at the

Oi some bone play connected
With your name;
If you succeed to keep your knees

At the thoughts of all the bullets

If you can do these things and
really do 'em,
You’ll be a regular soldier yet,
