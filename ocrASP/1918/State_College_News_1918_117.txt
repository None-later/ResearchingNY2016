Cunard, 'le.
l'rofessor Cameron gave a very in-

teresting and instructive lecture in

French on “ harles I’cguey."

Pegacy's death on the immortal bat—

tlclield of the Marne was an inspira-

tion to his fellow countrymen. His
works are not well known here.

They deal with the life of the labor—

ing class and show how the French

are devoted to their duty, never
leaving it until it is honorably and
well done. -

The religious side of chuey’s
nature shows his desire to return to
that ideal of which Joan of Arc was
a type. lie was not an orthodox
Catholic, but he loved the church and
its associations.

French students may be interested
to read his work on "Mystere de la
Charitc dc Jeanne ‘D'Arc."

Turkey-Day Football Battle at Ridgefield
a Score-lens Draw

The S. A. T, C. football team, of
State College, and the Centrals of
Albany, battled their way to a score-
less tie on Thanksgiving Day at
Ridgeﬁcld Park. A real battle it
proved to be, for the teams struggled
for an hour in a vain effort to put
across a score that would net victory.

It was a contest well worth seeing.
Excellent defensive work by both
teams, when a touchdown seemed

imminent, marked what
gruelling gridiron combat.

The individual honors were taken
by Sergeant Barry of the S. A. T. C;
eleven. Twice when the Centrals
attempted forward passes, which, if
successful, would have placed the
team in a fair. way to snatch victory
tflrom the soldiers, Barry intercepted
