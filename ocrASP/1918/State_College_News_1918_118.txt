BOOMING COLLEGE

Since April, 1917, State College has
shown her patriotism iii lumdreds‘of
ways and has succeeded in placmg
herself in the list of hundred per cent
American colleges. insides establish-
int,r a splendid army cantouiuent on
her campus, besides giving practically
every man of her student body and
alumni association to uclc Sam.
and besides placing herself at the
(liSposal of the United States govern—
meat for every possible service, she
has done scores of other things that
have counted for something in the
long run.

liacli separate service deserves
Special mention, but only a brief list
is possible. Among things worthy
01 notice—«and many will be over-
looked—arc: constant h't-tl Cross
work on the part of faculty and
students, large contributions to every
war relief fund, large plii'Chases of
Liberty Bonds, voluntary giving up
. of all elaborate social functions.
sending forth of Y. W. . A. cantcen
workers, giving of many kinds of
personal services—«and others ad in-
ﬁniturn.

livery student and member of the
alumni and faculty can but read the
foregoing list with pride, it is, in—
deed, a reputation of which to be
proud. Also it is a reputation to be
lived up to.

To live up to the reputation of an
hundred per cent American college
is not going to be an easy task. Yet
it will not be more difﬁcult than the
services rendered during the time of
desperate need. We have already
begun our response to appeals of the
reconstruction period. it is not to
be questioned whether we shall con-
tinue or not. It is certain that we
shall.

But just as charity begins at home/
so does service and loyalty. Besides
our duties to the world at large, we
of State College have duties and oh-
iigaiions to our college world. First
in our lives should he the matter of
keepingr State College at the front,
We should spare no effort to boom
and pnsbfthe college. There is al—
ways the opportunity to' speak a good
Word ‘for Alma Mater. There is
always the chance to advertise the
college broadcast. Then there is the
chance to pay the student tax, to sup-
port teams, publications and other
student activities.

S'l‘ATE COLLEGE NEWS, DECEMBER 5, 1918

With the disbanding of the,S. A.
’I‘. C. and other army cantonmeiits,
there is the certainty that men will
return to college, and the probability
that State can once more take her
place in the intercollegiate basketball
world. It will be a most diﬂ‘icult
proposition to organize and develop a
team. But with the prospective
stars, and such capable leaders as
Lobdell, ’20, and Fitzgerald, ’19, a
team of which State- can be proud,
will be organized. The team must
be boomed and cheered and bragged
about, and given ﬁnancial support.

And so with many other things.
it‘s a case of boom, push, shove, pull,
yell, cheer, brag, advertise, pay up
and work.

THE SAME OLD STORY

 

It's the same old story in the same
old way. This year's student tax is
not yet paid by everyone. A few
who are always loyal and faithful
have paid—other are slinkin out of
To think that
there are people of that type in this
colic - is a loathsome thought, but
necessarily so. And they are not the
people who don't do anything. On
the list of slackers are the names of
some of the most active of college
pcople— people who stand before the
student body as leaders and have the
"brass" to try to "put it over."
liut there are people who know—
and their knowledge is going to
spread.

i\1yskauia is considering taking
radical measures to rollcct back
taxes. Something must be done at
’HlCC. The list of those people who
have not paid will be publicly an-
uonnccd, and perhaps published in
the “News.” Still more radical
measures may b" .aken.

it is past tune for slackers to slide
in, just in time to saw-e their skins,
but there is still an opportunity.
This chance will he closed soon, and
then wnc unto those who have been
so despicable as to sneak out of a
paltry $5.00 duty.

The above article emphasizes the
need for money. The matter has
been discussed and advertised and
there is no excuse for those who fail.

As a gentle hint and a strong sug-
gestion-~scc Mr. l'lidlcy AT over:
and pay up. Above all things, be
square.
