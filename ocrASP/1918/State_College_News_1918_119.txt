S. A. T. C. GAME
t'oniinnt'd from Page 1

In the second period the soldiers
carried the hall to within the shadow
of the Centrals’ goal posts, but their
march for a truichdown was nipped
in the bud when the whistle [or the
end of the ﬁrst halt hlew. This was
the S. A. T. C. elcven's golden op-
portunity. Thereafter tltey were
seldom in position to start a drive
for a touchdown.

The Centrals. too, were denied vic‘
tory by the timer’s whistle at the
close of the game. in the last quar-
ter the Ceiitrals gained the hall, in
the solrlicrs' territory. by holding,r the
S. .I\. T. C. men for downs. A
march down the ﬁeld brought them
to the twenty-yard line. Here Schill-
intr tried a ﬁeld-goat but failed. The
game ended a minute later.

worthy of it. Next. the college at‘
tempted to sing, " l :\in't Got Weary
Yet,” but until alter the second time
the cnllce‘ nave it. it would be hard
to convince any one that the stn~
dents meant what they were singing.

given iii a rousing,r manner, and the
“sing” was tittingly ended with
“S. C. T. Has Cultivated Me." send,

LETTER FROM FRESHMAN
t'ontintied from Page l
pretty ,Qﬂtitl protection from the sea.
The town itself was picturesque, but
the worst part of the whole thing
was the ban on .‘llnl'C liberty except
when accompanied by an ntlicet‘. * ’i‘ *
There were some tine old churches
that l should like to have visited.
Style of architecture is the square
box kind with frescoed walls and
lialustrades. The stores. as much
as l could gather from a paSSing in-
spection, made a fairly successful at-
tempt at heing modern and some-
what American. The natives go
barefooth practically all the time.
yet they wear. heavy overcoats and
wrap up their heads in bigr mufflers.
