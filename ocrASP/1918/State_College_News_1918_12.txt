mediately available for every man,

. , I _ What They Are
{War-Savings Stamps are the
. answer-of a great democracy to the
demand for-s democratic form of
government security. They are
‘5 little baby bonds." Like Liberty
Bonds, they have behind them the
entire resources of the Government
and people of the United States.
They have the additional advan-
tage that they steadily increase in
value from the date of purchase
until the date of maturity, and
increase 'is guaranteed by the
Government. These stamps are

automatically increase in value a
cent a month every month there-
after until January 1, 1923, when
the United States will pay $5 at
any post ofﬁce or at the Treasury
in Washington for each stamp
afﬁxed to a War-Savings Certiﬁ«
ente.

When you purchase a $5 stamp,
vou must attach it to an engraved
folder known as a “War-Savings
Certiﬁcate,“ which bears the name
of the purchaser and can be cashed
only by the person Whose name
appears upon the certiﬁcate, except
in case of death or disability. This
certificate contains 20 spaces.
these are all ﬁlled with War-Sav-
ings Stamps between December 3,
1917, and January 31, 1918 the cost
to the purchaser will be $2.40, and
on January 1, 1923, the Govern-
ment will pay the owner of the
certiﬁcate $1oo—-a net proﬁt to
the holder of $17.60. This is based
on an interest rate of 4 per cent
compounded quarterly from Jan-
uary 2, 1918. The amount of War-
Saviiigs Stamps sold to any one
oerson at any one time shall not
exceed $100 (maturity value), and
no person may hold such stamps
or War-Savings Certiﬁcates to an
aggregate amount exceeding $1,000
(maturity value).

If the holder of a War-Savings
Certiﬁcate ﬁnds it necessary to
realize cash on it before maturity
he may at any time after January
2, 1918, upon giving 10 days’ writ«
ten notice to any money—order post
ofﬁce receive for each stamp afﬁxed
to his certificate the amount paid
therefor plus I cent for each
calendar month after the month of
purchase of each stamp. A regis-
tered certiﬁcate may be redeemed,
however, only at the post ofﬁce
where registered.

in other words, the plan is
simple. straightforward, and cer-
tain. The holder of the certiﬁcates
cannot lose and is certain to gain.
He is buying the safest security in
the world in the most convenient
form in which the security of a
great Government has ever been
offered to its people.

Why You Should Buy Them

The main reason for the pur-
chase of War-Savings Stamps is
because your country is at war.

which every man woman, an
child can save and lend in order to
feed, clothe, arm, and equip the
soldiers and sailors of America and
to win this righteous war in de-
fense of American honor and the
cause of democracy throughout the
world. ,

if we are to win the war, we
must win it as a united people.
The savings ofcvcry man, woman,
and child are necessary if we are
to hasten the victorious ending of
the war. or Savers are Life

“ SMILEAGE BOOKS ”

 

Ever proud of our men in the
service and anxious to do every—
thing possible to make camp life
agreeable, the college is endeavor-
ing to raise a sufﬁcient sum to pur‘
chase smileagc books for each one
of our absent boys. These books
contain some admissions to the
Liberty theatres established in the
camps and cost one dollar each;
if every student will contribute
ﬁve cents to this cause a sufﬁcient
sum can be raised to purchase it
book for each man. Payment may
be made at the table now main-
tained in the main hall for this pur-
pose or at the general collection to
be taken in chapel Friday morn-
ing. Is ﬁve cents too much to help
make ourrboys a bit happier? They
are doing their hit for you; can
you afford not to do this lunch for
them? ‘ .
