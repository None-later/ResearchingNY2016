Mr. Brown ——“I had a queer
dream last night, my dear. I thought
I saw another man running off with
you."

Mrs. Brown—~“ And what did you
say to him? "‘

Mr. Brown—"l asked him what
he was running for?"

Up to Date

Hooverizc? "
I'Ie — “ Hooverizc? ”
She—“Take a little roll with

honey."

Quite Impossible

 

Wix—“I see by this paper that
more than one-hill of the world’s
population is feminine."

ix—~"l don‘t believe it. If it
were so how (lo you account for the
fact that one-half of the world
doesn’t know how the other half
lives?”

Truthful Scot

A lawyer was examining: a Scot-
tish farmer. "You’ll allirm that
when this happened you were going

ome to a' meal. Let us be quite
certain on this point, because it is a
very important one. Be good enough
to tell me, sir, with as little pre<
varication as possible, what meal it
was you were goinr.r home to?"

“You would like to know what
meal it was?” said the Scotchman.

“Yes, sir; i should like to know,"

Father Dunney's Subject Is
Ferdinand Foch

 

Father Duiiney’s rcceut address
before the Newman Club was one
of great interest. The subject was
well chosen. for there are few men
in the public limelight to-day more
talked about than Marshal herdi-
nand Foch. Yet the public knows
little of his life history. Everyone
is marking,r his deeds of valor, and
consequently everyone is curious to
know of the influences that shaped
such a character as his. Father
Duiiucy spoke authoritatively, Since
he has made a close study of the
life of France's hero.

Ii‘athcr Dunni-y said in part:

“Recently lhc forlimcs of over
5,000,000 Allied soldiers of licl—
giiiui, France, ltzily, Siiplaiid and
America have been placed in the
hands of this one man; upon his
brains, ability, strategy rests, hu—
manly speaking, the success of our
iirniirs lighting for democracy,
cleansingr the earth with their
blood in order to makc it :i decent
spot lo livc lllmtI. Seldom, if cvcr
in history, has such trcluciidous
responsibility devolved upon a
llllil‘llhl man. lint how, you may
ask, how can this roinc to pit. ‘
I aim: that commander is ch )
inch a man, every inch a soldier.
every inch a patriot, every inch :1
commnder. Naturally enough the
questions rise to your lips: .Who
is be, where does he come lrom,
what have he done, wiiy is he whcrc

' The answers to those
quciits furniin the lesson that is
So well worth learning.

“ll‘crdiiiand linrh was born in
Tarbcs, 66 and a half years ago,
and was bred in that little triangle
of territory, “risque-Land, which
has produced such immortal com»
mnndcrs as Ignatius Loyola and
l’rant‘is Xavier.

“I'ro Ilt'il cl l‘atrizi was the
vzry .\. l. (S. (if the boy’s upbring»
iup. Even as a youth the talent
for mathematics was noted, as
also was his passionate love for
history. Now, llUlIlillg is clearer
than the lriitli [hail environment
and early cdurntion arc the chief
determinants of character. Young
lfoch’s surroundings and early
lessoninus were such as implanted
religion and patriotism at the very
bases of his Cllill'i' tcr. He was
taught as you \vcic taught, that
pzllrintism is no mere matter of
voice and show; it is an affair of
the iuind. the heart, the will; it is
a virtue; an enterprise of the
\\'lil)l(‘ soul. linch learned that |cs~
sou well. Ilc was a I00 per cent
patriot. Graduate from a Catholic
collr , whch history and innthc-
mat  were his pet subjects, he
entered the army. lie was sig-
nally endowed with the ‘gcomct—
rlc’ mind, and while at the Poly~
technique showed the stiitf-—nicn~
tail stuff and moral stuff—of which
.. made and was cvcrywhcrc
regarded as ti clean, straight, up-
standing, exemplary fellow, who
was bound to make good. Don't
think for one moment, however,
that his path was an easy one. it
was uphill lighting most of the
way. It took him 34 years of solid
service in the French army before
he became a brigadier conii‘naudcr
of artillery in the Fifth army

" In 1914, when they were ready
to cuter the High school he was
appointcd (:oiiiimindcr of the
Twentieth corps iiL Nancy.

""hrongl‘i long days, 45 '5,
he was with his beloved soldiers,
teaching them the :1er of war, iii-
spiriug them for service in lhc
stirring their faith in
France and rukiudling deep in

“When llC was asked how he
could do those things he ausW“

I'Ilt' first he was a man of prayer.
‘\Viilch and pray' was his watch-
word. He fought his lirst great
battles for his religion. He stood
up always and everywhere for his
faith. Stcadily and surely be
forged his wa-y to the front be‘
cause he was a man of prayer and
ti man of perseverance. No mat—
ter how hard the way, how cruel
the setbacks, he came back fresh
and strong. 'lx’cpulse' he always
maintained ‘is the half-way house

the ascendancy csl. blislicd by the

MOTHER GOOSESTEP

I love those dear Germans,
Their hearts are so warm,
And if we disarm them
They’ll do us no harm.
We'll send them new clothing
And shiploads of food.
They’ll divide with the Allies
Because they’re so good.
—From N. Y. Tribune.
