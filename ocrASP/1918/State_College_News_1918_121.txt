FRESHMAN PENALTY
DAY FRIDAY

Three Hundred Upperclassmen
Watch Fresh Clean Sidewalks

Never was the fact that State
College is really making history
more evident than lasl Friday
afternoon. While traditions here
are few, there are going to be many
established during the current year.

As soon as the S. A. T. C. was
demobilized the \ . . young sophs
refused longer to accept army ex-
cuses for failure on the part of the
li'rosh to keep the Freshman rules.
Since Tuesday the Soph vigilance
committee has been busy "getting"
the violators. Friday, at assembly,
a notice was read stating that
lireslnuaiu penalty day would he
put illlu effect at 4:15 that after-
noon.

l'roniptly at the stated hour a
group of evil It'rosh. whose names
had appeared on the bulletin board
during the day, gathered in the ball.
A day's fall of snow made the
Choice of time excellent, Armed
with shovels and brooms, and led
by Charles. the master of cere-
ioon s, the line of criminals
marched through the back door and
around the campus to the front cn-
trance. 1|ere they were ordered to
clean steps and walks for the criter-
tavimncnt of about three hundred
upperelassmen.

While the spirit of '2! deserves
the same praise it received last
year. it is only fair to say that the
hrosh are jolly good sports. They
accepted their punishment grace-
fully and did their work with a
spirit that is a credit to '22. It is
the kind of spirit that will give to
alumni a feeling of reverence for
college memories.

There was one unruly child who
quite resented tho indignities
pressf‘d upon her independent self
by Sophs, but, luckily, her kind are
in the minority. And she will learn
by harder experiences that it is best:
to be a good sport. Added years
and college associations will some
day make her a real college mem-
ber and a member of '22 of which
her class will be proud.

V LOOMING UP

Manager Lobdell Making Arrange-
ments for Late Schedule

at the eollege and the uncertainty
of the continuance of the S. A. T.
C., Manager Lobdell has found it
impossible to present a varsity
schedule at this time. The man-
ager has games with the following
teams pending: . r

r. Lawrence at Albany; Massa-
chusetts Aggics at Amherst and at
Albany; Williams at Williamstown;
Union at Schenectady; R.‘ P. I. at
Troy. Then there remains the New
York trip which, in past years, in-
cluded games with Pratt Institute,
Manhattan College and Stevens In-
stitute.
