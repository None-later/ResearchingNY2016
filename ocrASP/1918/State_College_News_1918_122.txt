CHRISTMAS, 1918

A walk down town, the sight of
stluw-cuvct‘cd pavements and
lawns, thc smilng faces of passcrs—
by. thc prospective vacation a week
ahead—all these things remind us
that December 25th is not far
away.

(iay red and green decorations,
holly covered boxes. various sized
packagcs—all show its that the old
spirit of Christmas is coming back.
Luxurious gifts will be the rule
again, perhaps, and thoughtless,
meaningless giving may rulc, too—
bnt this .‘icCIlls impossible.

Just as y ’avrs of peace and pros—
pcl‘ity made Americans lose sight
of thc meaning (if 'l‘hanksgiving
dav so also have they taken away
some of the true significance of
Christmas ’ Christmas cards and
booklets, sermons and scriptures
tell us that it is the birthday of the
Prince of l’cacc and the anniver-
sary of the night when the star of
Bethlehem shouc so brightly, and
angels sang "l’cavcc on earth, good
will toward men." We have heard
and read these things. then forgot-
tcu them again for the more attrac-
tivc cxtcrnal things.

int this year it must be different.
Americans never knew the incan-
int,r avud valuc of peace until they
lost peace and suffered the grim
horrors of war. Then they longed
for the spirit of the Christmas sea-
sou and the lasting establishment of
peace. _

December 25th of this year may
see the signing of treaties of peace
that will end the hideous night-
mare of the past four years. Cer-
tainly it sees the signing and effect
of the armistice of November 11th.
It sees the day. “that day of peace
and love," that bringshack boys
for whom countless prayers have
been offered. It marks the time
when peaceful reconstruction will
take the place of ruthless destruc-
tion in Europe. It marks the time
when silence reigns over battle—
ﬁelds where peace once seemed a
mockery. . v - _

Perhaps never before, and, cer—
tainly ncvcr since 1865, has Christ:
mas come so near to meaning what
Christ intended it should.“ it does

with Christmas. but let us remem-
her that these things are only side
lines—only material accmupauia
incnts to the spiritual significance
of the day.

As we sing the carols of the
Yuletide and whisper the magic
keynote of the sca-snn—“l‘cacc”—-
let us not forget the (liver of that
peace and the King whose birthday
we are ctnnmcmoratiug.

ashiuucd to say, of our deﬁciency.
To think that the most of the stu-
tlt'ufs showed such utlcr disrespect
to the sprakcrs is a disgrace to the
name of State College. When Dr.

constantly. is it to bc wondered at
that we say the reputation of the
college hangs in the balance? Stub
pose you, who were so bored liri-
day that you felt it your duty to
mad“! as much disturbance as pos-
sible in order to let the speakers
know just how you felt about their
speeches, were asked to speak be-
fore a student assembly on some
matter of vital importance? Then
suppose the student: body treated
you as if your words were not
worth listening to, and as if they
were in a hurry for you to “get it
over with"—~pcrhaps you would
then lcaru what courtesy means,
and practice it.

it does not cost you anything to
be courteous. Remember—if you
develop the habit of listening cour-
teunsly it will be a quality that will
he to your advantage. Don't be-
have like the Germans. for they
have the happy faculty of showing
just that same egotistical inditicr~
once to speakers as we have been
doing. Shall we let this indiffer—
ence grow into a college tradition?
It is becoming one, for when the
Freshmen see this rudeness of the
upperclassmcn they, too, will prac—
tice it as each year goes by. Then
let us fi ht this menace and stamp
it out. hen we go out: into the
world we shall then desire to carry
with us associations and memories
of State College that will be open
to the world to judge~zmd if its
judgment is adverse, the discredit
will reﬂect back to State. ’20.

ONE OF OUR FRESHMEN
SPEAKS HER MIND

in the Class of '22 l doubt if
there is one who, although col-
lege has been in on only
cigllt weeks, would write, like that

 

 

“lfrosll of ‘19." “State College IS a
brick building. There are three of
them," instead, each one would
say, “S. C. ’1‘.. winning rather than
losing. but winning or losing,
5. C. ’1‘."

How has this chaupe in ideas
come about? llas it not been
caused, perhaps, by the lirosli-Soph
rivalry? No one can go far wrong
by following: the best of all books,
the Biblc. Thus, no lirosh can go
far wrong by followng the Fresh~
man Bible. But just as the rules
of the Bible are sometimes broken,
likewise the regulations of the
Freshman Bible are oftentimcsdis-
rcgardctl._ Then comes the fun,
The Fund! of '22 strolled boldly
through the front entrance of col-
lege, or disrespectcd those high and
mighty personagcs, class ofﬁcers.
aml the members of the worthy
body, Myskania, merely to afford
the Sophs an opportunity to fulﬁll
its desire—a desire to hold a Pen-
alty Day. Therefore Penalty Day
took place Friday. December 6th.
Preceded by a “pee-rude," as a
whole, it was a “gala event,” al-
though brought to an early close
by the coldness of the Sophs’ feet.
Per-hops, next time, the Sophs will
hold it in a warmer place and it
will last longer.

But. Froshl attentionl Live up
to your Bible, or, if, accidentally
on purpose, you forget it, take your
medicine like a sport! ‘Then Sen—
iors, Juniors. and even Sophomores
will say, " '22 is,indeed as class."

f IN ANSWER

 

Jloom collegel Yes. indeed, we
want to boom our college in every
way. May We add a word to last
week’s thought?

Fellow students, is there a better
way to put our college on the map
than to have outside people know
such a college exists? We. within
it. are all HUMAN; we out, we
sleep, we study, we read news«
papers; in a word, we are not so
different from the folks on Western
and Madison avenues round about,
us. Many of these people think of
us as “Tl l l': N(,)l\’.\|,.'\l.." Wt‘. can-
not blame lhcnI as loin,r as we
ti.‘\.\'N(‘)’l' show them Slate Col-
lege is our guide through warring
days and peace days.

Now that the crisis is over. we
look forward with heart’s content
to new times. Are we to be nar-
row, be made narrow (cducation
supposedly points the other way).
by having jolly hours by i'ntrsclvesi
l say we ill‘t' human, therefore are
cutitlcd to human rights. Let us
cxcrt some of tho-ac rights NOW,

“good old days" of \\'llit.l history
