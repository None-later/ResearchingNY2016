And so I didn’t swallow itl

But oh! it makes my mother squirm,

Becanso she “thinks” I ate that

“No,” replied Yank, “it's to rest

the jaw after answering questions."

SOLDIERS

 

With apologies to the author of
“Smiles”

 

There were soldiers who were
naughty,
There were soldiers who were
good,
There were soldiers who were seen
out walking
When the orders did not say they
should!
were soldiers who could
ne’er remember ,
Thch were proper times to be
I I
So they spent their days in scour-
ing kettles,
Or in guarding the walks instead).

recent wndidntc far State senator,

ley, president 0 tie College Con~
sumcrs’ League. Mrs. MacMillan

showingf its importance. “The
pcoplc,‘ she said, “are the ultimate
employers of labor and are respon-
sible for the conditions under which
the employees work." he ex-

Miss Blair, in behalf of the club,
thanked Mr. Kennedy and Miss
Grace Wavgcr, ’18, who took so
much interest in the compiling and
designing of the Honor l\'DlI.

The meeting was then turned
over to Mr. Kennedy, who gave a
talk on explosives. He began his
SpCCCll with a brief history of the
use of explosives, dating back to
the Chinese and Hindus many ccn-
turics before Christ, and to Greek
lire, a form of gunpowder used in
the time of Alexander the Great,
308 A. D. The ﬁrst chemical for-
mula was found in the works of
Roger llacon. Following this brief
survey, Mr. Kennedy discussed the
manufacture of the three modern
kinds of gunpowder: the propul-
sive, which sends the shell out of
the gun; the disruptive, a violent
powder used for blasting, in tor-
pedo heads, or inside the shells;
and the detonators, a very hrusnuc
actioncd powder and used to ex-
plode the shells. The steps taken
in the making of black powder and
nitro—ccllulosc were also discussed.

Mr. Kennedy’s talk was very in—
tcresting and instructive. It is a
matter of regret that more mem—
bers were not present, but it is to
be hoped that more will be present
at the next meeting, Jan. 3d, at
which Miss Maurion Baker will pre-
sent a paper upon “Gasscs Used in
Modern \Varfarc and Some of thc
Uses of the Gas Mask.”

tokens of the feeling of Company
A men toward their ofﬁcers.

In spite of “K. P.," “Fatigue,”
and other scores against the men,
for which the ofﬁcers have been to
a great extent responsible. the men
felt genuine regret at the enforced
severing of connections with
Knighton and Gabclcin. Company
A was made up of college and Law
School men—all greenest of green
rookies. But with steady work and
concentrated effort the command-
ers have made a company of which
to be reasonably proud. Their per-
sonal influence on the character and
soldicrly bearing of the men is
greatly appreciated. Company A
extends sincere thanks and hearty
good wishes for future success to
their ofﬁcers in command.

ing Will he held to elect ofﬁcers
and to discuss plans.

The program of the club has not
yet been decided upon, but it is/
expected that the meetings will iii-
ciudc discussions and the reading
of papers pertaining to the subj‘egt
of mathematics. ,‘

The mathematics department is
to be complimented upon its dis.-
play of interest in its particular
science. The formation of the club
will no doubt add enthusiasm and
zest to study, as well as adding an-
other social group to those already
here at college.

MODERN PROVERBS

 

A stitch in time saves embar-
rassing exposure.

People who live in glass houses
should dress in the dark.

As ye saw, so shall ye rip.

Where there's a will there's a
IaWSuit.

It's a: long lane that has no ash-
arre.

Not all who carry hammers are
blacksmiths.
