MCMAHON ELECTED
CHEER LEADER

Last Year’s Leader Gets Lead of
46 otes

As a result of Monday's all—day
balloting, Lawrence M. McMahon,
’20, was elected cheer leader by 46
votes. Ralph ' Ilaker, '21, the
other candidate, will hold the po-
sition of assistant cheer leader.

The success which McMahon
had last year undoubtedly won the
election for him. Baker. beingr a
new and untried candidate, came
in second in the race, but his work
in the position of assistant will
surely show up his ability. With
two such leaders as McMahon and

akcr, State College will surely
hold its own in noiscmaking at
games and assemblies.

On Friday last, 10 and behold,
dear old Santa came to visit many
happy children at State College.

even go-carts. They were good
little children, too, from babies in
long dresses to little boys and girls
of ten, and Santa gave everyone of
them a present.

Three of these children were
made doubly happy by a pleasant
surpriso from Mi55 Bennett. They
were the winners of the G. A. A.
song contest. One of these three
little girls who brought honor to
her.class before in the Junior song
