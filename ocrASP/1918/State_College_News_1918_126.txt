IS COLLEGE TO BE A-
DEAD REFORMATORY?

Everyone knows that the spirit
of State College is unprovlng. ’Rcal
college spirit has been born here,

and organizations are going to nur»

turn it along until we have famous
traditions the same as any college.
The students are "playing up”
remarkably. The Fl‘OSl'l have
shown that they are really with us
———and the other classes have been
“ there ” all the time. The men are
working hard to make a team.
They have worked hard all year to
keep a college spirit going wllilc
they were in the S. A. T. I.
or is is admitted, world-wide,
that " All work and no play makes
Jack a (lull boy." The men of this
college do not do about with an in—
jured air, nor are they consumed
with self-pity. But they are justly
indignant that all they can do is to
work. For some absurd and idiotic
social events. especially
dancing is desired, are
branded in this institution as
though they were to be responsible

.for some hideous plague, Yet how

harmless such things really are!
Consider the Jllnior—Frosh Re-

ception. Did anything unlawful

happen? Was there ever a nicer

"‘party" ‘held in our gym? And;

there were men, some of them out-
siders, there tool Was there ever
a more digniﬁed and delightful ball
held than either of the two military

College is dubbed by outsiders us
an reformatory. All students know
that. And we begin to wonder
ourselves if it isn’t to become such
a place. True, the girls can have
very proper little parties where
they play infant games, and may
even dance with each other. But a
maul Shivers a-ud horrors! Peda-
gogical dignity of future teachers

PAGE 2, COLUIVIN 4

Yes, look! Page 2, column 4.
is headed “tax slackers.” It is a
column that is a disgrace to State
(Tollcgc, yet is one of those " tlcccs—
sary evils," app ‘c t y

In all, thirty~sxx hours have been
givclt over by hlr. l:l.idl‘ey to col-
lccllug the strident tax. The
“News” has bccn‘giving weekly rc—
minders, student assembly notices
have emphasized the importance of
this: duty, and common conversation
llilSlllCld the matter in constant at-
tention, Yet thirty or more people
have shown themselves ,slackcrs.
Some of these are honor men who
have returned since the last day of
collection. Accordinglyut’hey have
one more chance, and their names
are omitted from today’s list.

The matter of excuses is easily
disposed of. The above paragraph
shows that ignorance of the matter
is not possible. It may be hard
for some to get $5.00, but others
have done it, and it is only fair that
all do so. hrl‘mcovcr, during the
live—weeks period of vacation any-
one could llavc earned $5.00.

Particularly disgraceful is the
fact that the upper classes have the
longest lists. This is too small a.
matter to comment on. ~~

“’hile the entire college suffers

a black eye by a weekly slacker list
ill its publication, far worse is‘thc
effect on the individuals. They are
marked people whose only chance
to drop out of the limelight is to
pay up— when it is almost too
c.
It is to be hoped that the issue of
January ninth will contain no such
column as the one which inspires
this editorial. Christmas vacation
offers a chance-to earn $5.00. Who
will fail to do so?

PUNCTUAL ATTEND-
ANCE AT ASSEMBLY

r

 

’5‘
a.

At the end of the notice concern—
ing to-morrow's lecture on “ Italy
in the VVar,”‘which was sent to the
“ News " by President Brubacher,
there occurs an exhortation from
the President himself that students

epidemics.

 

be punctual in their attendance at
assembly. This was. no doubt.
added to the announcement as a
hint concerning the feelings of our
President on the matter of student
attitude toward the weekly assem-
bly periods.

Last week's "News" contained
an editorial comment on the lack of
courtesy ill student attitude toward
speakers. It is not necessary to
re-llash that matter. and it is un—
fortunate thzl-t this new phase of
the question has to come up, but
when more than half a semester is
gone and people have not learned
to be prompt, it becomes necessary
to take some action.

To lecture to college people on
such a subject as punctuality is
ridiculous—so ridiculous that the
“ News " will not attempt to do so.
There is not a person ll"c who
needs to have the net: t and
even decency of rcspcctful punctu-
ality pointed out.

T‘hcreforc it is only necessary to
state that every student is e. cctcd
to be ill his or her seat promptly
at 9:05 every lfridny morning. And
every student must and will be
there.

A FROSH SPEAKS— FOR
RED CROSS

 

 

 

 

>\\v'vllilc we are making,r pl‘rpllra-
[lens for a: Merry .Cllrist'lllas, we
should not forget that there are
many people who are suffering,r and
who need help from us all. We
are given an opportunity this week
to show olll' tlu’mghtfulucss of them
bv doing something for the lx‘t-tl
Cross. /\ Red Cross h‘lClllllCl‘Slllp
Drive is beingr hell in rollcge under
the leadership of several captains
and their lieutenants. These pco~
plc will be sure to look us all up.
and when they come to us we
should be ready to say good-bye
to our dollar bills with a smile.

Perhaps, now that the war is
over, we think the work of the Red
Cross also ceases; but, very much
to the contrary, it goes on just the
same. There may be no sick and
wounded soldiers to care for ill the
future, but there are always home-
less and needy ones, put in such
conditions by fires, earthquakes and
it: is always the Red
Cross that is on hand at such times.
Although we personally do not
know of these misfortunes, never-
theless they exist all over tllc
country.

A great effort is being made to
have a one hundred per cent mem~
bcrship ill the Senior, Junior,
Sophomore and Freshman classes,
as well as in the faculty. There is
a desire that each person in State
College may be seen wearing a
Red Cross button. While we are
buying our Christmas presents, let's
be sure to lay aside ONE dollar for
the good cause; and let’s make a
decision that that: dollar is. not to
be touched for any other purpose.

Cone on, Freshmen, and every—
one! Let‘s have a record that will
be worth showingr to those outside
of our College! ’22.
