Santa Claus gave each one of them

Everyone voted the party a huge
success.

easily, but the rest! We decided to
hold a second meeting. It met: in
the Auditorium, December 2. We
acquired a treasurer that time,
Gladys Lodge, and a vice-president,

meet again for our other oliicers.
On December 6 we nominated song
leaders who aren’t elected yet, and
cheer leaders, Winifred Dunn and
Kathryn Merchant. Finally, on
December 13, there evolved a secre-
tary, Marjorie Maxwell, :1 re orter,
Sophia Rogers and a. cheer coder.
Kathryn Merchant. We still have
a song leader to come, and we still
want to elect all of our candidates!
