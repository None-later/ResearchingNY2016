Dr. Matzki, medical-adviser of
women at Cornell, was then pre-

of the government to advise wov
men in matters physical. The de-
mands of war brought forth woman

in this capacity, health is neces-
sary. In order to prevent women
from returning to their old super-
ﬁcial point of view, the govern-
ment is taking steps to educate
them. A campaign has been insti-

time." But as time went on it be-
came evident that artists not only
were giving the most valuable serv—
ice in the way of maps, camouﬂage
work, etc., but also by their pic-
tures and cartoons were doing
more than anything else to break
down the German morale. Louis
Raemakcrs alone produced one
thousand cartoons of such bitter-
ness and appeal that the Kaiser of«
fcred twelve thousand gulden for
his body, dead or alive. At ﬁrst
all the work was purely voluntary,
but after a while the various gov-
ernments appointed several artists
Iliijm each country to work offici-

a y.
Professor Zug then showed a

long series of pictures and cartoons '

representing work of artists of
England, France, Italy, and Am-
erica. Among the British artists
were Muirhead Bone who has pro-
duced a book written on the West-
crn Front; Joseph Penncll, who
has been working on an artistic
record of the war; Frank Brang-
wine, famous for this lithographs;
Bairnsfather, noted for his humor;
and Nevenson. who is thought by
many to be the greatest artist of
the war. There are two striking
characteristics of Nevenson's work:
Its deep pathos and its new theme.
namely. liic seen from an airplane.
The French were represented by
many artists of equal grade; of
whom Foraine, Fadet and Favre
stood out most prominently. Pro-
fessor Zug is inclined to judge the
poster, “We'll Get Them,” by
Favre as the greatest poster of
the war.

In closing, he said that England
has produced the most picturesque
work, France the most tragic, ,Italy
the most beautiful, and.I.ouis Rae—
makers, representing Holland. the
most commanding and effective.

SPANISH CLUB
Continued from page 1
interesting to note that although
Spanish is spoken in the countries
along the western coast of South
America, Portuguese is the ofﬁcial
language of the whole of the east-
ern part of Brazil, and that pure
Indian is still spoken in the in-
terior, while dialects of English,
French and Dutch are spoken in

the Guianas.

Professor Stinard also described
very vividly for us the social con
ditions 'now existing in South
America. He demonstrated how
many centuries must pass before
the races can become absorbed
sufﬁciently to bring about such a
unity of feeling that South America
can progress as North America has
done.

DR. ARTHUR G. WARD
Continued from page I

Dr. Ward, who survived his wife
by only three years, leaves two
daughters, one ﬁve years of age
and one three. One sister, who re-
sides in Syracuse, also survives.

The funeral services were held
from his late home at 851 Myrtle
avenue last Tuesday morning at
eleven. A large number of stu.
dents and faculty attended

Dr. Ward came to State College,
occupying the chair in French, in
1911. Previous to that time he had
taken A. B.. M. A. and Ph. D. de-
grces in Yale University. and had
studied in European universities.
From 1901 to 1911 he was an in—
structor in Yale.

At this time it seems ﬁtting to
quote a paragraph from a tribute
paid to Dr. Ward which was
printed in the issue of October 3rd:

“ * * "' such students
whose rare good fortune it was to
have come into daily contact with
him there is a distinct sense of loss.
To work for him was a constant

leavsure. His courses were not
imited to the material contained
within the covers of the books
used. They were educative in the
largest sensa of the word, They
were a constant appeal to intensive
and extensive study. His kindliness
and enthusiasm were infectious.
One could not remain long in his
presence and heindiﬂ'erent to the
inspiration of his ersonality. We
fee that we have ost touch with a
very near-and true friend."

Their song is well worthy of being
known by every G. A. A. girl.
Learn it. It is tuned to the chorus
of "Smiles."

There are clubs enough in College,
here are clubs of every kind,
There are clubs that delve in “lit”

and science,
And they surely do improve the

There are clubs for music, French

their way ,
But there‘s one that brings us all
together— .
And that one is our G. A, A.

G. A. A. will bid you welcome,
For no matter who you are
We are sure that you will find

Much credit is due them for their
clever songs. Catherine Boland
stands out not only for her clever-
ness in song writing, but as a cheer
leader too, for she was elected such
unanimously by G. A. .

Much praise is due to the com«
mittec in charge for the unusual
success of the party. They were

Dunn, ’22. Everyone enjoyed the
cleverness of Santa, whose roll was
played by Miss Futterer.

During the evening each class
gave a clever stunt. The Fresh—
men class, represented by Eunice
Rice in baby clothes. was brought
to the party in a go-cart by her
bigger sisters, and they recited a
piece about the " Freshmen class.
