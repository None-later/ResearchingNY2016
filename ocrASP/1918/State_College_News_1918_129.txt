Music Club Entertains with De-
lightful Program.

After the customary singing of
Alma Mater last Friday morning
at Student . . mbly, the College

surprise being: an entertainment by
the Music (flub. Miss llclcn lteitz,

few words about the club's activi‘
tics, and concluded with a cordial
invitation to all the students to
join.

. Lucille Smith, '19, began
the program with a piano solo.
Mis. Smith has a delightful touch,
and her number was cucorcd
heartily. The reading following, a
selection from Pollyanna, given
by Gertrude (irecn, 'Ztl, deserved
all the t'tttltttsiasllc applause it re-
ceivcd. Miss (ireen's interpretation
and character work were excellent
The ncxt number was to have been
a violin solo by Gertrude Sonthard,
’21. but Miss Southard's violin cvi-
dcntly developed a fit of stage
fright, for it broke one of its strings
during the tuning-up process.
Miss Southard plays exceedingly
well, and it is to regretted that we
were deprived of the pleasure of a
solo by her. Florence Stubbs, ’20,
sang very charmingly. Site was
ably accompanied by Dorothy

Purple and Gold Quintet Open Basketball
Season by Scoring 28 to 15 Victory

BARRY CARRIES OFF INDIVIDUAL HONORS

State College basketball team
opened its season last Saturday
lliglll by winning from Williams,
in an exciting: contest, by a score
of E‘s-IS, in tho \\"illiauis tiollcgc
gymnasium.

The Albany live presented a
speedy pair of forwards in Harry,
’_’I, and Fitzgerald, '10, who car-
ried off the night's honors, The
star of l.ltc evening was llarry,
State's left forward, who st‘orctl but
one point lrss turn all n Wil-
limns' tram put together. He had
a total of fourteen points to his
credit when the game ended.

The State boys cut loose in the
first half. scoring sixteen points,
while live w . the best Williams
could do. Williams was the tirst
to st'orc. however, getting at our.-
point load after llt'c minutes of
play. “ Fitz " came right. back at

 

 

them, lnaltitlg the count one all,
and then put his tram in the lead
by scoring the tirst field basket Of
the u'atnc. After that most of the
play was in State's territory. Barry
dribbled through Williams' defense
and Lichtenstein followed with a
long shot, licforc the half cndcd
tarry and Sprintt'inann divided fottr
llt'ltl baskets between them, and
“Fill” counted oncc more from
the foul line.

Williams showed better form in
the second half. but was unable to
mmpctt' with the Albanians. The
t ‘lttll work of the Albany boys was
excellent despite the fact that it
was their first game of the season
and that after only one week’s
practice. Harry played sensational
ball this half, scorng four more
baskt'ls from the ﬁeld. Williams

Many pcoplc at'Stalc College have
been only vaguely interested in the

"The distinctive pnrposo of this

dancing class of last year? Were
not many of you who attended
enabled to enjoy the Collch flinc-
tions all the more after having'
learned ltow to dance? '

For those who did not havc,thc
pleasure of attending this class, a
short review of the reasons for the
class and the work accomplished may
be worth while.

and even some of the upperclassmen,
did not enter into the spirit and fun

the class parties which were
