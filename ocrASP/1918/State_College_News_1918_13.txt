Lost—Henry Vaughan (in 50

else that is lost probably belongs
there too.

The following, clipped from an

some of us at not having chapel
exercises any more.

THE HOME OF THE BRAVE

 

0h! Say can you sing from the
start to the end
What so proudly you stand for
when the orchestra plays it?
When the whole congregation. in
voices that blend,
Strikes up the gm 1] hymn and
tortures and slays it,
How they bellow and shout when
they’re ﬁrst starting out,

'Tis "The Star Spangled Banner”
they're trying to sing,

.liit they don’t know the words of
the precious old thing.
Hark! The “twilight's last gleam-

ing” has some of them
stopped,
liil tbe valiant survivors press
forward serenely
To “the ramparts we watched "
Where some others are
drnppcrl
And the loss of the leader is
manifest keenly,
Then "the roekcts’ red glare" gives
the bravest a scare
And there’s few left to face the
“ bombs bursting in air"—
"l‘is a thin line of heroes that
manage to save
The last of the verse and “the
home of the brave."

his thoughts wander to summer

Wright—Shelley

 

Mr. and Mrs. Charles‘E. Shelley
01' 102 Jay street announce the mar-
riage of their daughter, Amy
Jenclte Shelley, and Alfred M.
Wright, formerly of New York.
The marriage was performed Jan-
uary 23 by the Rev. Charles C. l-Iar-
riman, rector of St. Peter’s Episco-
pal church. The bride was at-
tended by Miss Bertha M. Tate of
Ogdensburg. Sergeant Merritt Lee
Allen was best man. The wedding
was hastened owing to the possi-
bility of the Albany base hospital
going to France, the bridegroom
being a member of the unit.

The bride was graduated from
Albany Academy for Girls in 1916,
and is completing a course in
household economics in the New
York State College for Teachers,
class of 1920. Mr. Wright is a
member of a contracting ﬁrm in,
Albany and Pittsburgh. He at-
tended Cornell University. Last
June he entered the military ser-
vice. '
