STATE’S VICTORY

Page one announces that State
College was victorious in the first
gamc of the scason. Three rousing
cheers for State, for Coach Maroney
and for every member of the team!
It is the personal duty and privilege
of every student to congratulate and
praise the men who put the purple
and gold at the top.

To thcse mcn much praise is duc.
Out of a hopeless maze of athletic
discouragcmcnts which arose from
war conditions, a quint has grown

which State will be justly proud.
After only four days’ practice under

OUR POLICY

The “News” has been criticised
recently for its failure to publish a
set policy which it proposes to fol-
low. The fault is acknowledged, and
the only excuse to offer is that the
material published week after week
has served to set forth as deﬁnite a
policy as can be maintained by any
paper under the existing conditions
and nnccrtanitics of the past year.

In the ﬁrst place. the "News
aims torbc loyal to the United States,
its government, its ofﬁcials and its
policies. The ideal of loyalty Is
aimed to be practiced down through
State and local governments to the
organizations, traditIOns, customs and
interests of the college which it
represents.

In complete] - representing the
State College, t e ” ews" aims to
be thorough and accurate in depict-
ing the ideals for which the college,
the faculty and the students stand.
It aims to publish accounts of all
the social, religious and administra-
tive affairs pertaining to college life.
Each report is carefully written and
edited so that four volumes of the
"News" will contain the college
life-history of every student who
spends four years at State.

0n the editorial page the Board of
Editors strives topublisb editorials
and articles which show the attitude
of the student body concerning vital
questions, both national and local.

 

 

STATE COLLEGE NEWS, JANUARY 16, 1919

Here should be voiced student opin-
ions, ideas and suggestions concern-
ing an ' phase of college life. "To
the E itor” letters are always Wel-

-come, and will be publishid if prop-

erly compiled and ,SIGN .‘D.

By way of summary, the "News"
aims to be loyal, truly representative
and just. it aims to bc a repre-
scntativc organ of and for the Col-
lege. it further hopes to so honor
State College that she may maintain
her place among the great colleges

of America.
THE EDITORS.

SHALL THE STUDENT
BODY INCORPORATE?

For some time, there has been
discussion among students concsrtr
ing the formation of a legalized cor-
poration, embracing all student
ﬁnancial affairs. A careful consid‘
oration of the matter leads one to
see the advisability of such a course.

Such an incorporation could in-

clude the student tax fund, alumni'

athletic field fund, cafeteria moneys
cooperative book store moneys, and
other similar student finances. While
the actual budget sums of each in—
dcpcndcnt branch would be kept
separate. and under the direct stlpcr-
vision of the local trcasurcr, cabinet
or governing body, thc whole would
be subjcct to thc directorship of a
board of trustees, composed of stud—
cut and faculty members, and pos-
sessing a treasurer of the common
fund.

it is difficult in a brief editorial
to present the merits of the system
mcntioncd above, or to argue in its
favor. A few of its many advan—
tages arc:

First, State College would take
one more step for equality with
such other collcgcs as Syracusc,
Corncll, Rochester, and Columbia.
In all of these institutions the sys—
tem has worked out excellently.

Secondly. the financial status and
standing of cach member of tho
corporation would be firmly cstab-
lishcd. That is, Ct‘t'tiilﬂts of each
individual member would be rcas—
surcd couccrning thc reliability of
that member, if a part of a large
corporation, lcgally certified by the
Secretary of State of New York.

Thirdly. such important arguments
as the one concerning thc rcccnt ap-
propriation of the $400 from athletic
funds would be determined by [he
board of trustees rather than by un-
necessary public discussion and vote.

Again, unpleasant situations over
non-payment of student tax would
be taken care of. Membership in
and privileges of the student associa—
tion would be determined by pay-
mom of the tax.

And so on——indcﬁnitcly. We
need the incorporated assorintion.‘we
want to have it—-—we ought to have
it. What shall we do?

THE QUARTERLY

While we do not maintatin an
exchange or "critic" rlrnartmcnt,
we are this week making some
comments on the new “ Quarterly ”
which made a recent debut at
State College.

In a very short time after the
ﬁrst copies of the "State College
Quarterly" were in circulation.
much of favorable comment was
to he heard about the halls. Be-
yond anv doubt these criticisms
were lust and well deserved. The
ﬁrst issue of the new magazine
marks a big upward stride in col-
lctrc publications and college life.

For manv years the college was
served ‘lw the "Echo." which an-
nearcd monthlv venr after year.

Then in the fall of 19l6 the weeklv-

‘lNcws” began publication. serv-
ina better the immediate needs of
the student body. After this. the

 

 

publication of tho~ "‘Echo” be-
came much more difhcult. Only
thoso who have served on the
" Lclto ” board during the past two
ycars can begin to realize the un-
mense amount of work and lack
of appreciation expertcilccd ‘by
those in charge of the publication.
‘A two-year trial seemed to prove
that a monthly literary publication
was an impossibility. ‘

Accordingly, thc editorial stall
of the “Licho” and several faculty
members have spent much timc
and labor in the organization of
a ncw and better literary publica-
tion. The first edition is a most
worthy result, and Is greatly ap-
prccialcd by the student body, As
is shown by this copy, it is far
better to publish a large, complete
and fairly cliuliurtttc magazine
quarterly rather than a thin,‘ rather
cinpty monthly periodical.

This only adverse criticism, and
onto which seems to be generally
made, concerns the title adopted
for the publication. The common
opinion is that the scvcrc gray
cover, bearing the title “State
Colic-go Quarterly" should appear
on a tttisslouttry or Sunday school
paper rather than a iivc, active
college publication. Many students
fuel that lbs: "Echo" is such a
traditiouai part of this college,
having for yours bccn connected
with the collcgc, that it should
continue as the name of thc publi-
cation now called the Quarterly.
The. suggestion scents worthy of
cousidcraiiou. llccausc of its
youth, the college has few tradi-
tions, and it might be wcll to re-
laiu the traditional name mcu-
tioued.

It is outside of the business of
tho “ News" to criticise too harsh-
ly. However, it is to be hopcd that
some otbrr uamc replace the one
now used on this splendid ncw
publication which has appeared
among collcgc organizations.
Whatcvcr happens, the "News"
extends hearty congratulations to
the “ licbu” board, and a hearty
welcome to the ncw quarterly.

To ‘I/m Editor of the Nun/r and

r [yr/(twin ;

W“ printing the list of Tax
Slackers of the last issue of. the
“News” justifiable? Should not the
people whose namcs appear thch
have been notified individually bc-
forc being pcrmancnlly recorded as
Tax Slackers?

You may answer that notices were
posted on thc bulletin boards and
that the tax was talked about in
Studcut Assembly and in the halls.
All 01 these are perfectly legitimate
methods of notifying students of
college doings, but had there been
at any tune a reading of the names
in Student Assembly or had the
uames_becn posted on the bulletin
hoarde Both of these methods are
less .dl'astic mcthodsvthan the list as
it did appear. As some of those
named may have been too busy to
stop and road all the notices on all
the bulletin boards to find one among
the many, and, too, perhaps some
good reason prevented attendance at
Sunlight Assembly, should not the
individuals have been finally notiﬁed
and given a chance to make good
before printing a list in a College
publication which would constitute a
permanent record?

And were the College Registrar's
Recordsconsultcd before the names
were printed? Was it right to call
people who have left this institution

slackers ” and to record them in
the annals of the College as such?

ortly after the tax was called
for, one of the persons whose name
appears on the ist had the amount
of the tax and sought in vain for
someone to take that tax. Finally
she met one who told her that she

 

 

would be notified when and'whcrc
it could be paid. That notification
never came, except as indicated
formerly, and when hcr name ap-
pcurcd as a Tax Slacker she was
justly indignant. This person is one
who cannot spare the tune to search
out every notice on the various bul-
letin boards and has a legitimate
reason for not attending Student
Assembly. is she a Tax Slacker?
NO!

A SENIOR.

IN REPLY

My way of reply to the above let-
tcr, it should bu pointed out that
h-lyskauiu has neither time nor
moans to notify personally cvcry dc.
liuquent in the matter of tax pay-
ment. Notice was given in asscnp
blics, on Bulletin Boards and in
several issues of the “News” that
some drastic action would be takcn.
'lgnorancc of the law excuses no
one, and Myskania cannot be ex-
pected to force every student to road
notice published in various places.
The f ‘t that a student did not read
an (illlCiEli notice from the Dean
would not cxcusu him from rcspousi-
hility in thc mtltlcr concerned. The
cascs are parallel.

The Registrar‘s rccords were con-
sultcd at the time the lists Wch
COtttpiiCti. Any names which should
not have appeared, but which did,
\vcrc thcrc bcczuisc the office had not
been of” ia‘lly notified of the stud-
cut's having dropped out. h'lyskania
and tho " News" board rcgrct thc
errors in last week's list, but studcnts
cannot expect the oflicr: to drop
names from lists until officially in-
formed.

The matter of informng the writer
of the above lcttcr as to the time and
pl:th for payment is explained in the
ﬁrst paragraph. Plenty iof notice

was given.
