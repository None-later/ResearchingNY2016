THE AMERICANS
CAN FIGHT

“Anti They Said We Wouldn't
right." This is equivalent to
“Couldn't Fight.” Well, we wouldn't
tight from desire. But we can ﬁght
wltcn forced.

That we can light has seemed to
be a matter for general surprise
front colonial Louisbttrt,r to current
Chateau-'l'hierry. A fter every
American virtory has eonte tltc re-
llcctiou: “The Americans showed
tltat they could light.”

Astonishment attd (:xultation at
our lighting ability never wcaries
even by oft-repeated victory. Listen
to the unvaryint; story.

After the marines, iisltcrtncn of
New England, lighting,r under Pep—
perill, had taken Lonisburg in 1745.
that so-callcd “ Dunkirk of Amcr~
ica," the sole reﬂection was surprise
tltat so strong a fortress should yield
to a force so unknown.

The militatry eott'nnent on the
.l’renelt and Italian War is again
that the Americans showed that they
could liaht.

Betti. nin Franklin with grim
humor wrote on the liritish retreat
from Concord, "a most vigorous rc-
tt‘eat, twenty miles in three hours,
scarce to he paralleled in history, and
the l't'rhlt' [\llll‘l'll'ltllS, \tho pelth
them all the way, (:ould warm-1r keep
up with them," Lexington Common
amazed the world that minute men
would light and could light.

Bunker Hill stirs the historian
.erky to " that untrained
militia could await calmly and could
stand against British t't'ttttlitl'n’.

"ht: some old surprise at victory
tltat by tltis time ought to have been
expected shows old time rigor,
wln-n at New Urleaus, Andrew Jack.
son proved that backwoods lcries
could worst regulars, trained in the
Spanish l'eninsnla.

How many times, Old Hickory,
must we repeat this to make it an
old 1" ' l' story?

Within our own day, the world
\\'U|ttlt't'tl(l at the (logged and intrepid
persistence of the dangerous charge
at San Juan .llill. The victory of
Santiago Harbor appeared so amaz-
ing a feat of accurate gunnery tltat
song and solgan celebrated the sur-
prising achievement of “The Man
Behind The Gun."

Shades of Paul Jones and Perry!
Wlty astonislnncnt!

So recently tltat not all the names
of dead heroes are known, the
Marne, Chatean-Thicrry and St. Mi—
hiel surprise us with the stale an-
nouncement that “Americans can
light.” America in the heart of
France stands true to its proud
record. Let the marines tell it to
us that there is no such word as re-
trcat in tltc marine vocabulary. We
refuse to register surprise when one
German ofﬁcer says, "You can kill
them, but not stop them," and an‘
other, “What kind of people are
you? Every time we fire, you
charge.”

We remember with pride Lookout

Charge. Surely these are proof

enough of American valor. With
pride we remember, but not with
boast, for we have not always ex-
hibited our best. Even Washington
could learn from his defeat at Great
Meadows. Bladcnsburg Races and
First Bull Run were sad lessons.
But Washington was never caught
again. New Orleans wiped out
Bladensburtz. while the events fol-
lowing Bull Run proved that the
Civil War could not be conducted on
a picnic basis.

We are not braggarts; neither are
we cowards. c are not bullies;
neither are we quitters. Slow to
anger. we are deadly in action. They
not only thourvht that we wouldn’t
ﬁght, but that we couldn’t ﬁght.

Away with our own surprise at
ancient phenomena. Vcctory is our
habit.

G. A. A. APPEAL

Basketball! llavc you ever
heard that word before? Yott
wouldn't think so if you saw how
few people turn out for practice.
You all want inter-class games,
don’t you, girls? Of course you
do, but you can't have teams with-
out players. Show a little more
enthusiasm about the game and
come out with your respective
classes. It doesn’t matter if you've
ncve _cd before. Every good
player had to begin, and had to
practice too. They don't just drop
out of the sky. yott know! Show
your class spirit—everybody out.

Fresltmcn.—— Monday noon hour.

Tttniors.——-Thnrsday noon hour.

Seniors— Vi’cdnesdav noon hour.

Sophomores— h'lontltty at 4.

if you can’t come with your own
class come with one of the other
classes.

Everybody out!
