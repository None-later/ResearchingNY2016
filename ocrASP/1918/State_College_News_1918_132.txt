SATURDAY DANCING CLASS
Continued from page 1
attended as few or as many times
as the pupil wishes. It became evi-
dent that :1 class in dancing was
desired, for the class was well at-
tended from the very beginning.
And, indeed, many of those who at-
tended the class came not to learn
how but to improve their dancing.
Those who had no idea of how to
dance before entering the class were
soon (and it was surprisingly soon
in many cases) able to lead and be
led by a partner, without stumbling
or endangering newly polished foot-

Wear.

Beginning next Saturday, this class
will be resumet. The instructors
will teach the eleiiteiitary steps of the
waltz, the one~step, and the J'oxvtrot.
No atteuipts will be made to teach
fancy steps of any kind.

All college students who want to
learn how to dance or improve your
dancing, come and see if you don’t
think that the class is worth while.
Remember the tithe: Saturday after-
noon, from three o’clock to half-past
four; the place: the College Gym-
nasium; and the price: the reason-
able one of fifteen cents per person,
payable at the door.
