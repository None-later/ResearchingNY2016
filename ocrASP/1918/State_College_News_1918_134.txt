VICTORY AFTER DEFEAT

The Colgate game was defeat
after victory, but that is past now.
It is regretted that ten points above
State's splendid score of twenty-
1our took the laurcls from the
Purple and Gold, but it is the future
not the past that concerns us. With
such men as Springniann and
Lichtenstein laid up, and with
Barry and Merchant ill, and many
other (liscnuragcmcnts which we
are too good sports to mention. it
is not to he wondered that we lost.

Friday’s game will surely turn
the tables. Victory after defeat
will characterize the play. So let's
forget the Colgate defeat, and go
“on to victory " Friday night.

CHEER!

lt‘was quite a surprise to every-
one, even ourselves, to hear the
lusty chccrs last Friday morning.
With no practice this year,
McMahon led the assembly with a
cheer rivalliug in noise and pcp any
cheers of the season of 1917-18.

Of all good signs that’s almost
the best. A college isn’t a college
without its cheers, and a game is
lost before it starts without the
vocal support of‘its spectators at
every winning shot. ' ,

The cliccr leader cannot make all
And Friday seemed to
show that he wouldn't have to. But
will students come out for special
practice? Often they will not.
But this year it must be different.
Assembly periods are too full for
practicing. yet we must practice
before, not at games, The leader
anti his assistant will give much
energy toward successful yelling,
and students will have to respond
when special practice periods are
announced; the gym must be
packed, even if lunch must-be swal-

Vlowed and yells given in the same

breath.

Friday night brings the ﬁrst
home game. Practically every stu-
dent owns a student tax card which
will admit him to the game, There-
fore every seat on the bleachers
should be taken by real fans, people
out to yell till threats are sore.

Out, everybody! ” S-t-a't-e C—o-l-

LETTER FROM ﬂoss. - ,
DENT BRUBACHER
Jan. 18, 1919.

To the Editor State College News:
Your editorial on the subject of
Incorporation of the College Stud-
ent Activities has greatly interested
and pleased me. You have taken
advanced ground on the subject

and have exhibited a kind of leader-,

ship which will mean a great deal
for the student life of State Col-
lcgc. l congratulate you upon your
foresight in Ithc matter.

it has long been clear that cer—
tain athletic interests should be in-
corporated. The Graduatcs' liicld
liuud'canuot go on much longer
without incorporation. So far ithc
fund has been inactive. no expendi-
tures whatever being made, but the
time is near Wilcll'lilis condition will
change. The wisdom of incorpora-
tion of athletic ﬁnances is equally
clear. Your further suggestion
that other studcnt activities should
be added is exceedingly good.
Funds are handled in connection
with student publications, with the
cooperative lunch club or cafeteria,
and with the cooperative book store
as soon as that can be organized,
it seems eminently wise, therefore,
to effect a membership corporation
of all extra curriculum activities
under some such name as the “ Stu-
dcni Association " of State College,
This will provide for thc making of
an annual budget for each activity,
for ﬁnancial responsibility, and for
annual audit.io thc Secretary of
State.

1 want to assure the student body
that steps will be taken by those
immediately interested to have such
an incorporation made. if there
are no legal obstacles thc incorpor-
ation may be accomplished in the
near futurc. Cordiall yours,

A. It. BRJBACHER.

FACULFY, PLEASE NOTE!

To the Editor:

just in the midst of Regents’
week, the atmosphch at college has
seemed rather artificial. We have
been "jogging along " in the usual
way with very little to interruptth
calm until now. To disturb this
equilibrium of ours, a growing
rumor has found its way out into
student groups. it is the announce-
ment of tcsts—-tests to be given
the last hour of every course.

This brings us face to face with
a question. Tcsts, though perhaps
not the immediate desire, in a sense
are the ultimate desire of all stu-
dents. Evcry pupil wishes to know
at some point what goal he has
reached, what success he has at-
tained. Examinations, or tests in
these abnormal conditions. are the
most adequate method of getting
this information, But the question
is: is it fair to the students to
crowd six or seven hour-tests into
the last two (lays of the semester?
There are many who must take
four or ﬁve such tests in success:
ivc hours on the same day. if
these people can write their test
papers under such conditions and
still do justicc to themselves, they
are unusual. it is safe to assert
that the average student, after he
had written two tests, could write
little more of value. Besides
worthless pa ers we would have
what we dont wavnt—thc sunken-
cyed “crammcr.”

But all this amounts to naught if
we don’t suggest a way out. In
courses that are to be completed
this semester, let the tests be given
the last hour in the course; but 'in

courses that will continue thru
the second semester, let the
tests be given previous to the
last hour in the semester at

the convenience of the instructor.

 

 . STATE COLLEGE NEWS,,.J,AN,UARY 23, 1919

Tliough «this suggestion may not
lighten the wor of all. students,
still it will benefit the majority. By
such a plain there is justice to both
faculty and students.

Vill those in power at lcast'iign-

sidcr our suggestion?

CONCERNING AN .
' ATHLETIC FIELD
The Editor of the State College

News:

Dear Sir,——State College amust
have an athletic field. This is an
old topic, we realize, and one sceni-
iiigl settled. But once havmg it
settiisd that sometimc we shall get
one, ivc have packed the idea away,
and gone about other business.

it seemed to be an established
nrcccdcnt for each senior class to
subscribe toward the field. The
Class of 1919 seems to have its gaze
llXCLl upon another object, namely,
a memorial window to the late Dr.
Blue. it is just and proper that we
honor the memory of the man who
did so much for the college. No
one will gainsay that. But why
honor him by a stained glass win~
(low? Why not keep him in the
memory of the college by dedicat—
ing the athletic licld-to—bc to him?
This would be more indicative of
the man who worked so long and
so faithfully for democracy in edu-
cation. Which, thcn, shall we
choose, a cold, silent, light-dim-
ming piece of glass or a field re-
flecting and fostering the spirit of
the college he founded, and of the
grcat university which sometime
will rise from it?

it is not necessary to discuss in
this place the value of such a hold.
Everyone knows wllavt an impctus
it will give to athletics; what pres-
tige it will bring to the college;
how it will attract high school
athletes, and he of permanent
source of income to our Athletic
Association. But most of all, it
will be a college institution, a part
of our college life, the center of
student activity! What better inc-
;uoPrial for Dcﬂill Bluc could there
)c

Let us suggest, therefore, that
our athletic field be dedicated to
our late dean, and that Myskania
pass a resolution to that effect.
“Blue Field " let it be. Then will
the memorial for him aid in the
growth and development of the col—
lcgc into a university.

A COLLEGE MAN.

 

COLLEGE SPIRIT

We‘re hearing Z11 lot about class
spirit—college spirit—0r at least
i we're not we ought to; and yet,
if i were a betting man, I’d bet my
week’s allowance, that none of us
—-mysclf included, you understand
——know what class spirit is. Oh,
i know you “rah” when some one
thIS'you to “rah,” and attempt to
Sing when somebody waves a
pointer at you, but then you sit
back and say, “ Class spirit? Surel
That’s me all over.” But there
you’re wrong -— dead wrong!
That's a part of it—the rahiug
and the singing—if you really
mean it, but it's not enough, not
near enough! You're a slacker if
you stop there, and, worse than
that you're a hypocrite. Those
are strong words, aren’t they?
But I'd make them stronger if I
dared. Listen! If you've a good,
sensible, workable idea, that will
beneﬁt your class or college, and
don't do everything in your power

to further that idea and put it into

practice. aren't you a slacker?

Surat-thing you knowl And then
if you go to a class meeting and.

sing all about loving dear old nine-
tccn—somcthing—or other—

,wheu you don't for if you didﬂ oh

 

 

you’d work for‘ her— ou'rc a
nypocritc,'aren't you? ure vou
arc. Come on, then, if you’ve a
thou ht, an idea, an inspiration, :1
hunct maybe—l don't care what
you call it—give the rest‘ of us
the beneﬁt of it. And say—did
you ever try to make a thing go,
to make something a success, and
have everybody dragging you back
instcad of giving you a cw shoves-
uow and thou? Try it, and see if
you think it's fun. There’s a great
deal more work than glory in be-
ing' a. class ofﬁcer simply because
people drag so. it’s a funny rule
that works only one way too.
you want backing when it comes
to putting your Idea over, if you
want people to push you, you’ve
got to return the favor and do a
little pushing on your own account.
All ready now. Everybody push!
Freshmen, a little more pep. Sophs,
don't lct all your smoke go up the
chimncv. Juniors, are you suiicrv
ing from ennui, or what? We
haven't heard much from you or
about you. Seniors—but here I
hesitate. l—‘l—wcll, I guess I
haven’t the nerve to go on. '2].

A PLEA FOR
DORMITORIES

Mate Collcgc, we need dormi-
torics and need them badly. We
have one, and it's a howling suc-
ccss. Its very building cries out
cheer and comfort. Have you seen
it? Have you seen the bigr living
room with its cheery ﬁreplace. with
the davcnport (with accommoda-
tion for four, at least), in front of it
where inspirations can be found in
the blazing logs? Have you sccn
the dining-hall with its immense
iahlc around \vliich’io gather at
the call ’of that most welcome bell?
bell?

Oh. State College, why can't we
have morn: of this life? There are
dozens of houses just suited to this
purpose. Dormitories give. advan-
tages not found in any otlicr way,
socially and individually. They
offer means for development. Why
can't lhcir value he recognized,
heeded? .

This is not only a plea but also
a. petition, State College, and we
bag that it be heard. '20

A.~K. C.

i wonder if the college as a
whole has made a New Year's reso-
lution? If not, here’s a suggestion
for one. Let us form an “Anti-
Knockers’ Club," and have every
student in State College a member.

hc membership pledge for this
club would be, “if I cannot find
something good to say of a per-
son, I will keep still, unless i can

give constructive criticism or un—

less it is necessary to spent for
protection.”

but good does “knocking” or
sarcastic criticism do? As rubbing
a sore place makes it grow worse
and spread, and as hitting one’s
head mach a bump swell, so pick-
ing out the faults and peculiarities
of a person, and airing them with
no idea of aid or correction, gener—
ally makcs them worse.

I confess I have the habit of
“knocking,” and I think the ina-
.ioriiv of the people in State Col-
lege have it. Let us make “A,<K.
C." a slogan, a watchword. Every
time the hammer appears let some—
one cry “A.-K. ." Thcn would
State College soon be a modern
Utopia. , .

“Even so, the tongue is a little
member and boasteth great things.
Behold how great a matter a little
ﬁre kindleth!"

"Speak not evil‘ one of another."
“ Grudge not one against an-
t cr." ’7
