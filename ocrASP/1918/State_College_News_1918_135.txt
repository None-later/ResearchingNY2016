ABOUT THE CAFETERIA

Rumor has come to the Home
Economics department that there
are people in the College who are
criticising the price of the lunch
that is served in the cafeteria at
noon. The ilepavrtiiient wishes to
call certain facts to the attention
of such persons.

The need of this cafeteria has
long been felt, and although it
does serve as an excellent oppor-
tunity for practical work for the
classes in Home Economics, the
thought behind the cafeteria was
one of accommodation to faculty
members and students. The food
is purchased from the best food
houses of the city, and the patrons
can be assured that, in every case
of the service of food, the best
quality that is obtainable is served.
This includes milk, meat, butter,
eggs, and vegetables, etc.

When the cafeteria was ﬁrst
started, it was announced that it
was run at no proﬁt whatsoever.
The idea was to make it self-sup-
porting only, and what little proﬁt
might be made would be turned
back for improvements. This is
true as it is being worked out now.
The accounts are balanced daily
and are open to inspection at any
time.

it was thought the reason for
the criticism came through com-
parison of the small luncheons
that have been served in the de-
partment in other years. It will
be recalled. that very excellent
luncheons have been served for the
price of from twenty to twenty-
ﬁvc cents. At that time, the thought
was one of meeting the expense of
food only. No service entered the
budget of previous years as the
students in the class-room did all
of the work. This was entirely
possible, because of the smaller
number fed. Now as many as 170
are being served at noon, This en~
tails a larger amount of service,
and four regular people are em-
ployed to carry the burden of this
work. This, in itself, would add
to the cost of the meals. In spite
of the fact that buying is done
wholesale, thus securing a lower
price, it must be remembered that
prices have increased in the last
year 25 per cent.

A careful calculation has been
made to ascertain whether an over»
charge has been made; but, in
figuring up the cost of food and

 

the service rendered the price for
