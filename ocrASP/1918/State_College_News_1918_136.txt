it only in the form of ridicule.
You have not understand him nor
has he understood you. Between
you lies a. big gulf, for you speak
a different language. . There
are whole sections in our country
where only a foreign tongue is
spoken. Facts vital to the interest
of the nation have to be printed
in a foreign language. The war
has brought us face to face with
startling facts. Do you know there
are 5,650,000 people in our country-
,who can not read or write, and
that there were 2,000,000 men in
the draft who could not read their
instructions? Do you know that
in New York State there are 597,-
000 non-English speaking illite-
rates? The task is'here and now.
It is not one for the future. One
wise man has said, 'If knowledge
callcth unto practiccf—well; if not,
it'gocth away.’ Have you faith in
your foreign neighbor? Do you
believe

'It’s coming yet, for a' that.

That man to man, the world o’er,
Shall brothers be for a' that? "

many violated this by the use of
cloud attacks of chlorine gas. This
was followed by other chlorine at-
tacks, often disguised in smoke
clouds. Chlorine is an asphyxiat-
ing gas. Later tear gas, was and,
sent over in the form of shells.
Still later mustard gas. which is
the most deadly known. was em—
ploycd.

In some cases the protection
against these gases, was chemical,
but in the majority of cases the oc-
clusion of gases by charcoal was
employed. Samples of the various
gases—prepared by the advanced
organic chemistry class, were
shown at the meeting. -

 

 

Following this there was an open
discussion. Lieutenant Curtin
demonstrated the 'is mask drill,
after carefully explaining the spe-
cilic functions of each part of the
mask. 'l)iii‘ing an impromptu talk
by Professor Kennedy, Lieutenant
fftirtin was given a surprise attack
to get on his mask in maximum
time to allow sufficient protection
from any llltl air lloaiing around
the room.

 

l‘lnus for initiation of new mem~
hers were discussed and arrange-

ments made for next Friday, but
owing to a haskelball gavme sched-
uled for that date, initiation was
postponed.

SMILES

The twins had gone in swim-
ming without mother's permission,
and they anticipated trouble.

“Well,” said Tommy philisoph-
ically, “we‘re both in the same
boat, anyhow."

"Yes," returned Ray, the hu-
morist of the family, “but I'm
afraid it’s a whale boat."

The lawyer was trying hard for
his client and was setting the
points otit in a logical manner.
There was one thing he was not
clear about.

" Now, sir, ‘you state that my
client knocked you down and
then disappeared in the darkness.
What time of night was this?"

"I can't say exactly," the plain-
tiff answered with a, smile; “your

client had my watch.”
