STUDENT ASSEMBLY

Father Finn Gives Interesting
dress

The first of the lectures on topics
of the day was delivered in chapel
Friday morning by Father Finn.
His subject was the “Irish Prob-
lent.”

Father Finn pointed out that the
Irish question rests on the principle
first emphasized by America in
1776—that taxation without repre-

‘sentatiou is tyranny. The old
American principle of freedom is
now a world principle.

He said that the accusation that
lreland has been pro—German is
shown to he false by the fact that
there has not been an instance of
an lrishman fighting for Germany
in this war. On the other hand.
Ireland has given one-eighth of her
population for the Allied cause.

The war has been fought to pre-
vent Germany from imposing her
power on other nations and to in-
sure that all nations have self deter~
mination. The Poles and Czecho-
Slovaks, oppressed by Germany, are
sure to have their claims recog-
nized. "if 'Irclaud had been under
Germany, no man can gainsavy that
5116 would be free. Is it just to say

THREE PLAYS TO BE
GIVEN FRIDAY NIGHT
IN THE AUDITORIUM .

The Dramatic class is to present
three one-act plays Friday evening,
January 31, in the auditorium.
They are " The Rosette,” "Neigh-
bors," and "The Maker of Dreams."
Agnes Dennin has the lead in "The
Rescue." The play is well worth pre-
senting. Miss Dennin’s role of Anna
is difﬁcult but very well done. "The
Rescue " deals with a psychological
problem and solves it satisfactorily.
Mary Goodrich plays the part of an
old family servant. Marie Wend-
ling is the aristocratic aunt, the
last of the Wardens.

“ The Maker of Dreams " is
charming. Ethel McKenna, as
Pierrettc. has a delicate touch, and
you will not blame her for falling

 

in love with l‘ierrot, Florence:
Stubbs. Laura Marliarlane. who
plavs “The Maker of Dreams," .Iiu-
ishes the cast.

" Neighbors " is a country play
by Zuna Gale. It is very funny.
The yrumtr heroine. played by
Florence Van Ness, is well done.
The plot is simple. Elizabeth
(iurdner plays a character part with
her usual ability. Reginald Bruce
is the hero, Peter. As you watch
him you will remember maqu
Peters just as funny and just as
helpless. even if they chose some-p
thing else beside chairs to stumble
over. The other characters are
well taken, especially the self-satis-
lied lady acted by Gertrude Grcene..

The admission fee is 25 and 35
cents; reserved seats 35 cents;
Tickets can be obtained from any
member of the class. They will
also be on sale in the main hall.
Thomas O'N'eil's orchestra is to
furnish the music. We want every
student there who can come early
enough to get in.

INTERESTING LETTER
FROM PLYMOUTH.

Former Teacher or State College
Tells of Unique Experience

The following letter is from Miss
Gertrude Valentine, telling of an un-
usual and thrilling experience. It
reads:

"Yesterday was one of our fright-
fully stormy days. so I didn’t plan
to go anywhere, and was mighty glad
I hadn't, for I fell into luck here.
A mystery ship, or ‘Q ,boat,’ as it is
sometimes called, came in, then two
of the surrendered German U-boats
werebrought in, and in spite of the
howling of the wind, and the pour-
"1g of the rain, they had quite a
naval parade by way of celebration.
About 40 ships of all kinds, mostly
British, but some American chasers.
were in bne. 'Cruisers. trawlers, dc-
stroyers, launches. patrol-boats, ob-
servation balloons and subs. I gum
the U-boats never expected to come.

way. They looked old and weather-
beaten, and could probably tell some
