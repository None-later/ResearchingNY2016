EDITORIALS
GIVE US A SQUARE DEAL

 

Reports and rumors of harsh
and unkind criticisms of things
published in the News have for
several days been drifting into the
publication oﬂ‘ice. It isn't the fact
that we're criticised that annoys;
it is the manner in which the criti-
cisms are offered that brings forth
this. editorial. I

No one'about college is more
aware of the weaknesses of the
News than is each member of the
board of editors. Every pa er has
its weak points, and the ews is
not above the average. Our policy
was set forth in the ﬁrst issue of
the new year.. If we fail to meet
this policy it is because we do not
see our fault. , , ,

Just as ‘we know there is chance
for improvement, so are we anxious
to ma c that improvement. Criti-
cism is welcome— yes courted.
But we do ask that suggestions
come direct.to us who can remedy
defects, instead of being publicly
v discussed and allowed to reach us
in the form of- exaggerated rumors.

_Tw’o faculty members h'aVe made
comments directly to us which have
resulted in changes in the cases
mentioned. Likewise have we
proﬁted ‘by student suggestions.
We earnestly desire to modify our
policies after -further wise advice.
All that we ask is that kindand

ﬁrst,"tb'¢:n_ ﬁnd its place _in,public
discussion if We fail to respond. It
is justianother case of “Square

back the pltrys. and further push
student activities. A .
After careful consideration, Mys-

kania has ruled that since the dra-

matics class exists merely as a class
of the regular college curriculum,
and not as an organized student
activity. possessing a constitution
and duly elected ofﬁcers it could
not now share the stu ent fund.
Appropriations in the annual stu-
dent fiind budget are made only to
recognized official organizations.
here is, perhaps, no more de-
serving student activity than dra—
inatics. It is a kind of activity that
booms and advertises the college,
and should have a strong represen-
tation in the student fund. Then,
why not organize a dramatics club?
Other colleges have such clubs, and
State College has the best kind of

chance to rival any college on that‘

point.

The dramatics class as it now
exists would serve as a fertile nu-
cleus for 'a: strong club. Member-
ship can be Open to all students.
A constitution can be drawn up and
Ofﬁcers elected, and the club as-
sume a regular place in Organized
student activities. Then it can ask
for an appropriation each year in
the student fund budget, and be
supported by the fund. All rc-

ceipts will go directly to the fund.

Myskama is anxious to see such
an organization exist, and will glad-
ly entertain in student petition to
that effect. Myskania cannot form
the club, but is anxious to help.

' Then why not a dramatics club?

Be There Tomorrow Night
MORE ABOUT COLLEGE
SPIRIT

 

The game Friday night between
Hobart and State Colle e was ,3
atter, but
not only the team did credit to our
college. The student body was
well represented, and they brought
their college spirit with them. They
cheered faithfully throughout the
game. There could have been more
volume to it, but they did well for
the ﬁrst home game of the season.
How could they spare much time
for cheering when they were so
anxious to watch the playing?

It was not only the cheering for
State College, but the cheering for
the Hobart team that showed the
spirit of the crowd. Of course it,
is hard to cheer the opposing team
sometimes, but they did it—a
thing to make the college proud of
her sons and daughters.

May the same spirit prevail
throughout the year whether in
time of victory or defeat. Let us
hope it will always be victory.
Three cheers for S. C. T. ’22.

 

A SUGGESTION

, __
Dare a Freshman make a sug-i

gestion for the improvement of our
college publications? We do not
want the other classes to think that
we lack interest and enthusiasm in
our college publications—indeed.
we want to do our share in making
them the best in the country. It
is in this spirit that the following
suggestion is'offcred:

In many college publications, one
page or one column is'usually de-
voted to the different'c‘lass and so-
ciety‘oﬁicers, and entitled "Who's
Who." . On that page can be found
t e names and classes of all the
ofﬁcers of the, student Organiza-
tions. At a‘glai‘ice one can tell
“Who's who" in college. Would
not this be an im rovement to our
callege paper or 'Quarterly”? Let
the board of editors think it over
and then act accordingly. '22

 

 

(1. ﬂ  ll

 

State College has a wonderful
reputation as a pedagogical institu-
tion. What it.iieeds tolbecome a
“ regular place" is a little more
pep, and pep advertised as such.

Embryo teachers aren’t really
such slow, stale creatures as is
generally the opinion of students
pursuing other courses than ours.
We wonder if we can’t change this
crude idea by being allowed more
liberty in arranging places and
hours of social affairs,_in issuing
invitations to the same, in spending
our own money? What is it that
holds "numerous exuberant spirits
from enjoying our few social func-
tions in the way they please? Is it
custom, is it indomitability of will,

'or stalcncss of ideas? Mayhap it

is fear of arousing adverse criti-
cism. We wonder if it’s ever been
tried. l'iavc such disastrous results
ensued that it’s " nay for ever-
more?" Just imagine a junior
prom in the Ten Eyck ballroom, a
sorority or frat rushing party at
Farnham’s, a real banquet most
anywhere!

This is, we suppose, an old, old
plea brought on by being accused
of being a product of the "Normal."
We hope that the holders-down of
seats of authority in this, our Alma
Mater, will consider this bewail-
ment the next time an entreaty is
entered for a party or dance of our
own liking;

Times 'ave changed since '98,
and young people nowada 5 dance
from 9:00 till—say 2:30 in other
institutions) instead of 8: 11:00.
They make their own arrangements
as to "eats," music, and whom they
shall invite. The moral of this
might be “ We may as well be dead
as out-of style." (We belong to
the A.HK.-C., but this isn't knock-
ing.) '20.

 

Don’t Miss the Entertainment

B. S. STUDENTS — TAKE
NOTICE

 

If you are a major or minor stu-

dent in English do not bother to read'

any farther, for if. you do you will
possibly be indignant to be “af-
fronted thusly.” This article is di-
rected toward those students who are
majoring in sciences. The majority
of the B. S. people think that as soon
as they have dragged thru torturous
(?) freshman English, they have ful-
ﬁlled the obligation both to them-
selves and to the college catalogue.
But have they been fair to them-
selves? No, emphatically, no!

Just try to suggest to those stu-
dentsa course in English or Ameri-
can literature, and you will be re-
warded with thunderous looks for
your adVice. You will be told that
“I got all the reading I need, and
anyway I haven’t time to bother with
that stuff." Do they know how to
read? And what to read? And are
they wasting time “ bothering with
that stuff?"~ Well, hardly. In any
one of the literature courses one at
least assimilates ti fair knowledge of
good books,_ and besides, there is
brought to life. tin-interest in another
ﬁeld. You Will become critical of
what you read, and you are going to
form Judgments that would have sur-
prised you once upon-a time.

Asxde from obtaining. the idea of

big to derive a cultural beneﬁt. and
that is one of the greatest beneﬁts
you, should work for. hat good is
a college education tonny of us if
we don t: try to-get joy out of life?
We are not here, let us hope, to get
just a knowledge of this and that in
order to 'help us earn our daily bread;
we want something that is going to

 

make us bigger, better, and happier
women and men. When we go out
into the world we shall have to rub
shoulders with all kinds and condi-
tions of life, and that person should
be counted at failure who does not
help make that life a nicer and more
beautiful thing to live With.

UNDER THE BLUE AND
WHITE BANNER

 

There is something solemn about

,a Freshman class, solving its prob-

lems, adjusting itself to a strange
environment, and getting under head-
way. The grave, young ofﬁcers, al<
ready solemn with their great re-
sponsibility, the leadership of a class,
are somehow impressive. Perhaps it
is the new care in their eyes. For it
is an iiivportant care, indeed, and lies
close to the heart of every officer—
this undertaking the guidance of the
Freshmen. I-Iow wise and careful
and vigilant this head must be!
There isn’t going to be any time for
personal wishes. There is just the
class and you, who selected those
ofﬁcers, haven't you begun to treat
it gently too—that class feeling!
Do you know that it is going to
grow warmer every year you are in
college—and that it is‘going to
mean protection and friendship and
love and succcss——for you——all
these? Class S)lrlll It isn’t just
“ meetings ” up in the science room
and it isn’t just " talking a lot " as
I’m doing now! But it is standing by
the class oﬂiccrs and it is cultivating
a loyal affection for State College
and all that it holds out to you. Let's
not attempt to be wonderful—the
Class oﬁ’ZZ—but use our time and
energy in being merry and wise
enough “for to-day" and in keeping
"open house” for all our college
friends—under the blue and white
banner.
