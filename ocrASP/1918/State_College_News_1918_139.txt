INTERESTING LETTER

(Continued from page l)
tale. The had a larger British
Union-Jac' hoisted above the Ger~
man imperial flag. and it looked
good. I guess the whole population
turned out to see them. I shall never
forget the sight.

“Later I went all over the mystery
ship. It is a British boat, H. S.
Nettle, and was dressed up to rep-
resent an old tramp ship. None of
the armament shows, and the idea
was to go out and let themselves be
torpedoed, then they would send off
a ‘panic party,’ and when the U-boat
would come up and cavort about
gleefully, they would drop down the
sides, and up and at her. They gen-
erally got her, too.

"This afternoon I went all through
the U-lOI h, the perpendicular
ladders I climbed, the holes
squeezed thru, the conning towers
I scaled, the slippery decks I slid
overll I wouldn’t have missed it
for anything. They warned us par-
ticularly not to touch anything for
they were afraid that the Germans
might have left a bomb or so on
board! Nice cheerful little thought.
I don‘t wonder the Germans sur-
rendered. The British said that the
boat was the ﬁlthiest thing ever
when they got it; that no self-re-
specting English jig would live in it.
They say that the Germans at the
last ﬂatly refused to go out and they
had to drive them on board. In one
of the ofﬁcer's bunks they found a
loaded revolver, and in another a
ca-t-o-nine—tails, all blood stained. So
it must have been used! Looking
down thru the periscope was the
most fun. If I had to be on a
U-boat, I'd apply for that job, but
I can think of lots pleasanter places
to live and surely to die."
