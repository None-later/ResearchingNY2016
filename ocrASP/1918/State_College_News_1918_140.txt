RED CROSS APPEAL

 

The ‘following communication
from :the Albany Chapter of the
Red Cross is‘being sent out:

Since the signing of the armistice
the idea has become prevalent that
the work of the Red Cross is about
to cease. The natural result is that
many of our workers have lost iii-
terest and have discontinued their
services. The fact remains, ‘how-
ever, that one of our hardest tasks
is now before us—-—the makin of
refugee clothing, theneed of w ich
is tremendous. Albany's quota of
these garments is very large.
Therefore, unless the workers con-
tinue their past interest and co-
operation the quota cannot be ﬁlled,
and Albavny will for the ﬁrst time
fail in its charity.

Is not this appeal of the Red
Cross a sufficient reason for Col-
lege girls to get busy? For some
reason or other our College unit
of the Red Cross has been neglect-
ed this year, and it is high time
that we organized it again. Many
of us waste an hour or two wander-
ing about the building between
classes, because we are not in the
mood to study. Would not our
time be more proﬁtably 5 cut mak-
ing garments for our litt e refugee
sisters'across the ocean? Let every
girl give this question a serious
thought, and then get busy. '22.
