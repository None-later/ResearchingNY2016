SORORITIES TO OPEN
THE SOCIAL SEASON
AT STATE COLLEGE

Rushing Committees Are Getting
Busy And Psi Gamma Gives
First Dance

The sororities and fraternities
believe that since examinations are
now past and passed (P) a few
good times are necessary to wrpe
from our brains rnemr'n'ies of the
“' late nmdcasantncss.”

Freshmen are the most import—
ant people just: at present, and
rushing is now in order. Each
sorority will have one big party to
which they will invite the Fresh—
men in whom they are most m—
tcrcsl‘ed. The parties will all be
held on different nights, so that if
one girl is lucky enough to be
asked to more than one party, she
may attend each one.

The committees thus far ap-
pointed for the “Rush " festivities
are: Delta Omega. Alice Lewis,
chairman; Jessie Gifford, Tiernicc
Tlronner and Carol'ena Lipes;
Kappa Delta, Jean f'lungcrford,
chairman; Lois Knox, Elizabeth

TEAM BREAKS EVEN ON
NORTHERN TRIP

Win Hard Fought Contest at
Clarkson But Fail to “ Go Over
the Top ” at St. Lawrence

’l‘hnrsday, the basketball team
left on its animal northern trip to
take revenge on Clarkson for their
victory of December 14th, herC.
t‘oach Maroncy had the boys in
ﬁne mettle. The ﬁrst game was
played at Clarkson with the usual
line-up. Townsend and Nicholson
were used as substitutes. During.r
the ﬁrst half our men were handi-
capped by the unusual type of
basket used on the Clarkson court,
yvt were led at the end by only
three points, the score beingr
twelve to nine. The second half
was a continual ﬁght, neither team
ever having more than a two point
lead. With less than a minute to
play, State led by one point, when
Wilson of Clark-son made a spect-
acnlar shot and Techs seemed
certain of victory. Cohn got the
jump on Carroll and bounced the
hall to Fitzgerald, who passed to
Harry, Harry made a long; one
hand shot and caged the hall for
two points in the last half—minute
of play. making the ﬁnal score
22-21. Fitzgerald showed his usual
good form in shooting fouls. Cohn
played an unusually good game at
center. The Clarkson forwards
were held to few baskets by the
close guarding of Curtin and Polk.

The next night the team opposed
St. Lawrence in a tired condition
from the previous game and the
loin.r journey, The play was
rough throughout. State took the
lead at the beginning, but the half
closed with St. Lawrence leading,
15-11. Early in the second half
Fitz was disqualified for four per-
sonals, and' though the men put
additional pep into the ﬁght they
could not overcome the loss of
their captain and the game ended
with St. Lawrence victor, 3624.

The Student Assembly, Friday,
l-‘cbruary 8th, was entirely given
over to the discussion of matters
particularly important to the stu—
dent body at this time—Thrift
Stamps, Smiieage Books and Inter-
class Rivalry.

Mr. Miller spoke first and en-
deavored to clear away some of the.
misundcrstanding which has exist.-
ed as to the purpose and working
of the 'l‘hrift Stamp system. Mr.
Miller is a government agent here
at college and in that capacity he
cxplaiucd‘just exactly how a stn~
dent could buy these stamps, when
and at what place. lie especially
emphasized the fact that while
these investments art- in them-
selves payng affairs. the real aim
of the buyer is to do his hit to help
win the war.

Another topic of allied interest
is that of Smilcage Rooks. Joseph
Walker, president of the Senior
class, told us why the college
wanted to send these books to our
men. and by what means we would
be. unaided to do so.

.Vir. Walker then introduced the
chief subject of the morning. lie
spoke of college traditions and
their gradual change from year to
year, owing to the changing needs
of the college. New ones are added
from time to time, some old ones
are enlarged upon. and some old
ones disappear. This year is the
ﬁrst we have had a student tax, a
son),r leader or cheer leader. “’0 are
already planning improvements in
these lines of advancement. There
is one tradition which we have
been gradually losing during the
last few years, that of interclass
rivalry. \thn the Class of 1018
ﬁrst entered college, there was a
Wt'il deﬁned spirit of rivalry he.-
twccn the Freshman and Sopho~
more classes, which has since dis-
appeared.

Mr. T'leason discussed the matter
more in detail. Both the faculty
and the student council have been
considering the question and they
believe that certain kinds of rivalry
would be a good thingr for the col-
lcgc. In the ﬁrst place, the col-
lege needs the advertising this
would bring. Many people still
think of us as merely the Albany
Normal School and they must he
made to understand that we are
now the State College for Teach-
ers. Most colleges are known to
the average outsider only through
their athletics, or some particu-
larly unique traditional event—
such as the painting of the idol at
Union. Our athletics are doing
their best, as witness the fact that
a friend of St. Lawrence has re—
(‘cntly taken the trouble to attend
our basketball games in order to
give St. Lawrence pointers on our
weak places, Some of the fondcst
memories of many almnni are of
“scraps” between the Freshmen
and Sophomores in their old col—

 

lege days —and in after years they

\ .it their Alma Mater at the times
when these important affairs are to
take place.

The question is for us—what
sort of rivalry shall we have?
[first it is wise to ﬁnd out what
is done at other colleges. Mem-
bers of our faculty will address its
on this subject from time to time.
in order to get the student view-
point, the president of each class
will appoint two wide-awake
people from that class to learn the.
opinions and get suggestions from
all its members. The results will
be reported at the next Student
Assembly. Mr. Henson suggested
that a girl and boy be appointed.

Dean liorner spoke next. First
he remarked that there was one
State College tradition of which he
thoroughly approved—the one
which required Freshmen to re-
main scaled at meetings until the
upper classmcn pass out. In this
way, he said, the Freshmen would
lcarn patience and fortitude, and
that their patience would now be
rewarded in that they would re-
ceive their report cards at once,
whereas the upper elassmcn must
wait till Monday. The Dean was
pleased also with the enthusiasm
manifested by the Sophomores
over their ﬁrst class “sing,” and
he approves of all such “sings.”
.\t his college it was customary for
all students and facility to pour out
on the campus, the first evening of
spring, and sing. He suggested
that we might try something of the
sort here, provided that spring ever

came. \rVe might also have a
"l‘ost Exam Jubilee" (if the

Juniors would give their permis-
sion), on the Saturday night after
nn'd—ycar exams. .At this jubilee
professors (in efﬁgy) and un-
popular honks might be burned.
The boys could have a " ball push ”
on the campus, using a very much
enlarged football or basketball.
Two other activities which were
prevalent when Dean Horner was
at college, but which he does not
advise for us were: Onc~thc
