SMILE SOME

Up to Friday night there had
been contributed to the Smileage
campaign the sum of $17. ' his is
about half the amount needed to
purchase a book for each one of
our boys. It has therefore been
thought wise to continue the sub.
scriptioiis throughout this week.
it is hoped that those who did not
get an opportunity to “drop a
nickel in the slot " will hunt up the
Smileage box and do so now. That
there are still a goodly number of
such persons. a simple application
of the. multiplication table will cs-
tablisli, for at 5: each, seven hun-
dred students should be able to
raise a sum considerably in ad-
vance of $i7. Let us all do it over
again if necessary, for State Col-
lege must in no way neglect her
soils who are giving so much for
the cause of our country.

USEFUL INFORMATION
TO SENIORS AND
ALUMNI

 

 

Doubtless many of our readers
know something of the United
States Employment Service, that
branch of our national government
operating some 85 public (free)
employment ofﬁces throughout the
United States. We believe, how—

ever, that very few know that at
one of these ofﬁces. that at Chi—
cago, “L, a section has been set
. apart for the sole beneﬁt of pro-
» fessional men and women, known
‘ as the Teachers and Professional
Service Division. Through this
v division the government.endeavors

to ﬁnd suitable posmons for
teachers and professional engi-
neers and suitable persons for

school ofﬁcers and employers need-
ing such help, In a. few words,
this division is a Teachers' and
Engineering Agency, operated by

the United States government.
Dr.,P. B. ’f’rentis, acting director
of employment for Illinois. under
whose jurisdiction this division is
operated, reports that during the
past year it has been found im-
possible to ﬁnd enough teachers to
supply the need, and many attrac~
_ tive positions .throughout the
:. United States have been unﬁlled
for this reason. It has frequently
happened. however, that imme-
diatcly after a position had been
reported ﬁlled through other
1, ' - sources, zi‘suitable candidate would
‘ . effect registration. f course it
was then too late to nominate the
teacher for that particular posi-
tion. Dr. Prentis earnestly hopes
that such occasions may be quite
infrequent during the 1018-10. apv
pointnicnt season. This can only
be accomplished by every available
teacher being registered in the
division before the openingr of the
appointment season. We therefore

THE MARRAINE
MOVEMENT

 

 

Dear Editor:

There has been some discussion
in the ” News" lately as to the mo«
tive of the young women who un-
dertake to be marraincs. re—
ccivcd a name from the New York
bureau last November. i wrote the
second of December, The answer
to that letter has just come, since
it takes a month each wa. l
quote from the letter. trans atiug
as literally :is possible:

“i beg you to excuse me,
Mndamoisellc. for what l am going
to ask of you: it is not a very great
thing. but it will give me much
pleasure. If you would be kind
enough to write me quite often,
you will give me great pleasure
and will make me very happy, for
i should like to have many of your
letters.”

He closes the letter thus: “I
end my letter, Madamoisellc. by
and sends you from far away the
assurance of his best wishes.”

lfis second letter received a week
later closes as follows: ' am
waiting for news of you; receive
Mademoiselle, the assurance of the
best regards of a little French
poilu who again thanks you very
saying that your godson, a little
French poilu, does not forget you
much for your good letter."

These letters deﬁne the position
of a marraine. This boy is wait-
ing to go back into the trenches.
if our letters van cheer such boys
any in the. few months they may
ihave to live and to suffer, we
should he only too glad to send

 

 

‘tlieni. it seems- that these 22-year-
old poilus, understand our motives,
while our American classmates do
not.

Washington, D. C., Jan. 17, 1918.

To the Editor of the “ State Col-
lege News,” Albany, N. Y.:

My Dear Editor.—- For some
time i have been debating as to
who is or are the proper person. or
persons to thank for the cheering
Christmas box which I received
from the “ Faculty and Students of
N. Y. S. C. T. " and l have at last
decided that this can best be done
through the columns of your paper.
The gift was a welcome hint at the
spirit “back home}: and, needless
to say, was fully enjoyed by yours
truly, who is most grateful for hav-
int: been remembered.

Having done more or less work
in connection with the "News"
last year, it seems like old times
and like reviving old habits to now
be writing a bit that is to appear
in its columns. l have not seen
very much of the sheet this year,
and yet enough to know that it is
still living, for which i am glad.
it would have been a shame to see
the enterprise die after so much
time and labor had been devoted
to it last year. With the tax
putting an end to all ﬁnancial.
troubles. the course of the “ News ”
ought now to be comparatively
smooth. l wonder how much sup-
port you are receiving from the
student body? 1 mean the kind of
support that spells work. pre-
sume in that respect conditions
have not changed much. it has
always been up to a few to work
for the many, and until the many
realize just what they are missing,
they will be satisfied to remain
merely " the many " and wonder
why so—aiid-so or sucli-aiid-such of
” the few" seem to be getting
ahead.

How is the Press Club faring?
i hope it is coming into its own.
I am a ﬁrm believer in the 100 per
cent American maxim, “ it pays to
advertise," and in my opinion the
Press Club should be the advertis-
ing: medium of State College.
Here‘s a wonderful opportunity for
someone to get out of the rut and
do something. The Press Club is
bound to exert a mighty influence
some day, and if i may borrow the
well-known advertising slogan,
“Eventually—why not now?”

it must be near the time for mid-
ycar’s at college. Time flies and
before a very great while Moving-
Up Day will he with you and
Myskania will select the members
of next year's body. So it may
after all not be untimely if i say
a few words on what i think of the
system of tapping used last year.
in my opinion it was dead wrong.
That was a method of elimination.
not selection. [ known from my
own experience that it does a great
injustice to many a student. The
average student does not mind, per-
haps, walking across the platform
in front of faculty, students and
visitors, only to leave said plat—
form on the other end, he or she
having not been found ﬁt to be a
member of Myskania. The aver-
age student excuses himself with
the thought that he has not had a
chance to do things. But take a
student, who like myself last year
and the years before that, had
every imaginable chance given him,
had some of the highest ofﬁces his
class and his college could honor
him with bestowed upon him, do
you suppose it is pleasant for him
to run that gauntlet? For him
there are two verdicts-if he

 

zitays on the platform he has made
we best of his opportunities; if he

 

 

 

r .
3 turned back he is a failure. That
5 pure and simple logic.

is it necessary to ptiblicly brand
anyone a failure? l say no. Even
Myskania may make a mistake,
smiictinic—io err is human—and
the old method of tapping would
in such a case only add insult to
injury. it is quite enough to just
select the new members. Read
" Stover at Yale " and you will read
of a beautiful ceremony 21 certain
society there uses, whose old mem-
bers go out among the juniors,
pick their men and lead them back.
That, it seems to me, is the better
way to do.

in closing 1 wish to take up an-
other little niattcr that has been on
my mind. During the early days
of the "News," in fact before the
paper existed, i secured the con-
sent of Dr. lirubacliei' to have the
words “ Founded by the Class of
r018" appear on the front page of
the "News." it was one thing
among others that i had planned,
but which the outln‘cak of the war
and my joining the colors put an
end to. l trust, however. that this
matter can be arranged. There can
hardly be any objection, as ours
was the idea and ours was the
work that brought the “State Col-
lege News ” into existence.

What was intended to be a short
note of thanks has grown into a
lengthy cpistlc, so [ will hiii'ry this
to an end. in closing i wish to
once more thank everyone con—
cerned for the splendid Christmas
box. i will be glad at any time
to hear from old friends at college.

Very sincerely yours,

Alfred E. Dedickc,
Jil(l l..icut., 50th U. S. infantry.
