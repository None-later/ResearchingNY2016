the part of thc catltss crowd, but
really, all the lamilics had reason
to be proud, and most especially

SOPHOMORE CLASS
NOTES

The second sing held last li‘ri-
day in the rotunda was well at-
tended. The songs in which the
great majorin at the class par-
ticipated lillcd the whole building.
Dean llorner’s recognition and
praise of the first sing only served
to increase the spirit of the second
sing. Few undertakings of any‘
class have resulted in such whole»
hearted enthusiasm and success as
the Sophomore sings.

The class was well represented
in the Junior week functions. Many
prominent members attended the
festivities.

A class meeting was held
Tuesday afternoon. President
l'lcalc announced that Miss Fut-
tcrer would give a reading March
Ist, and urged all Sophomores to
go. A committee Im- drawingr up
a constitution was appointed.
Preparations for the Sophomore
party were continued. This affair
will be emphasized all the more
sint‘c the Sophomores are not per—
mitth to have a Sophomore
Friday.
