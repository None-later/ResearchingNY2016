a stream which ran hy the college
grounds. The steam was called the

hrook was quite deep—as Dcau
Horncr himself could testify.

li'rol. Douglass also described
"pushhalt" contests, but he
thought that the girls could take
part in this—here gcncral clap—

' The ball would not he
hcavy, but it would hotlnce off in
the most unexpected directions.
The host way to push the hall is to
not up undcr it. A ” Flag Rush "
might work out wcll here. At
Cornell three teams were chosen
from cach class, light wcights,
middlc weights and huavy weights.
Just two minutes was given for
Leach contest, the team won which
had thc most hands on the flag at
the end of that time. That class
won which had two victorious
teams. Cornell also had an annual
Springr circus, the purpose being to
raisc money for athlctics. There
wcrc plenty of opportunities offcr-
cd at thcsc to spend money, and
all lltc townspeople wcrc. invited.
The law students were policemen

charch thcy could think up. At
one tinic. the Dcan was arrcstcd
and lined a dollar for being present
without a lady. Another faculty
lilcntlttll‘ was arrested for not
ispfnding enough moucy on his

All these interestingr stories

tirc college hody, and loft cvcrynnc
looking eagerly forward to the
