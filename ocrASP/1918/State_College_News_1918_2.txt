classes fought ltard for the great—
est number of members, the
Juniors winning by two. The
Sophomores were next and then
the Seniors and Freshmen. A few
outsiders were geiierons enough to
give us their membership and otir
Red Cross Auxiliary wishes to
thank them.

.\‘uw that the campaign is ended,
we hope that those who did not
join during the campaign week.
will not think that tltey cannot
join. lied (Truss will welcome all
to its membership.

On Friday last, State College
students had the honor of being
addi , l )r. Finley. who was
introduced as our “courier” to
lt‘i'ancc. Owing'to the. time of
year. Dr. Finley started to wish
the roll ' a ” Happy New Yen',"
bitt hesitated and wished instead
that we have a ” flood and Great "
New Year. In order that this
might come to pass, he admonished
its all to keep our faces happy for,
be quoted, " When things are not
chcerfiil, people must he.”

Then in his pleasant conversa-
tional way. be related some of his
experiences in France.

The primary aim of this journey
was to study the schools of France
and, as he said. to learn from
France, whereas on a former trip
he had gone there to teach France
something. it is interesting to
note here, that the University of
France was probably modeled on
that of New York, for the latter
was founded much earlier, and the
two are much alike.

ilt' spoke of two great armies,—
Ilie army of Present Defense, and
ilte army of Ftiture Defense. Al—
though it' was his purpose to visit

 

 

 

 

ilie latter, nevertheless it was ttlt~
avoidable. that he see more or less
of the former, inasmuch as he
traveler] along the whole length of
its front frmu the North of Bel-
gium to Saint Die, The travelingr
was done in a military car, and
most of the way there was :1
cammitlagc of trees. He saw many
ruins and his first air battle. in
speaking of ” No Man’s hand." he
said that it should rather be called
“ Ft'ei'yinan’s Land." At Paris he
witnessed the triumphant arrival of
General Pershing.

One little anecdote is of especial
interest to Albanians. An ltalian
woman remarked one day at a
luncheon that. according to tile
greatest antboritv in the world. the
word “ America ” was first printed
at Saint Die. The authority quoted
was ,lobn Boyd Thatcher of
Albany. N. .

No discussion of the war in
France is complete unless the
women are mentioned, for by their
efforts. support is given to the men
at the front. Much has been said
of the various kinds of work they

Dr. Finley Brings Report to S. C. T.

Keep the School Open to Prepare “The Army of
Future Defense,” his Advice

ticularly noticed their extreme
politeness. For instance, a woman
subway gtiard always says " Thank
You" when she punches a ticket.
[tore be broke off for a minute to
compare his experiences in buying
a paper frnnt_a French women and
from a lloston women. The former
said, "Good
him the paper, told the price, said
“'I‘liank You” and "Good Day."
The latter did not even notice him
until he spoke; then she merely
pointed to the paper and said,
“ two." A friend of Dr. Finley's on
being told the story said that the
remark, “ two." showed inefﬁciency
on the woman's part ——shc should
have raised two ﬁngers.

To return to the “ Army of
Future Defense "—one Frenchman
said that the schools must be kept
open, unless the military authorities
forbade it. The schools follow the
trenches. Sometimes they are only
two kilometers from the front. and
never more. than ten. These
schools must ofneccssity be carried
on under the greatest difficulties.
Sonic cl are held in caves and
at times i has been necessary for
lllt' children to wear gas masks.

liit France's future army is show-
ing as brave a front as her present
one, and the schools are kept open
in spite of everything. One rector
of a University personally told Dr.
Finley the story of the school upon
which shells were being fired and
the teacher marched the children
away between shots—just in time
to escape a shell which ruined the
building. About 30,000 French
teachers have been called out: since
ihe beginning of the war, and of
these about 4,000 have received
special honors for bravery. It
makes us proud of the teaching
pro . ion.

\\"e are also proud of the fact
that the French children realize the
ext. net: of North America and
the. friendship of the United States.
more titan ever before. President
Wilson’s proclamation was posted
on bulletin boards tlirotigout the
country, and read in the schools.
('bie small boy was so elated over
knowledge of American history
that when asked who was a great
friend of “’ashington, he replied:
" Wilson." “Vive l' Ameriquc" is
the call of the French children.

The interest in schools, which is
being kept alive “over there " '

 

 

 

  

is
marvelous. Dr, Finley attended an
exhibition of the work of the
school children during the war.
This exhibition was held at; 7:30 in
the morning—and the President
of ilie republic was there. Shall
we close our schools because of :1
Coal shortage? Better close sonic-
lhini,r less important.

Last. but most important of all,
Dr. Finley told of the messages he
had carried to and from France.
lie carried over messages from
about 120 colleges and universities,
from President Wilson and Ex-
