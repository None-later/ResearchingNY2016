The Grind

 

Now. if your mark scents mean and

Let memory the reason show:

’l‘cll how the drudgng grinder

To earn her A mnrk duel set,

When in one night she earns by
rote

(llcr drivcn ht'uin hath throttth
each notr

Whnt ten loin,r t’ortnight’s could
not end:

Then lit-s her down the hopeless
1‘I' 1

And tinds stretched through her
drcruns the length

OI reigns of kings, their dccds and
strength,

And. ht'nin-tnll, oil to school shc

lire tho tirst hcll its summons
rings.

Yon. early off to had you crept

You hoped for luck and soon you
slept.

\\‘ith apologies to Milton’s goblin.

 

Dazed

 

Rally round the bulletin,
Rally once again,

Don't let any change of time get
hy you: .
You read the thing at nine o'clock.

Inok once more at ten,
Titttt's a consolation none deny
you.

Now are you straight girls?

Now are you sure.

test no hack, and question not

The St‘llctlllllsilc lure.

You'll lind the some folks gathered
there.

Still feeling insecure.

Blessings on the bulletin and‘

changes!

 

Roses are red,
Violets hluc.
Painter’s pink.
What are you?
Ask the Soph. president what hap-
pened to the roll of bandages?

I cannot liltigei‘ longer in the N. Y. S.

I've a note from Doc. Brubaeher
And he says they’ve busted me.
And my bloomin’ heart is aching

’Cause I cannot stay no more
In those stately halls of learning

Oh, the N. Y. S. C. T.. that's where I

I can see its lights a-glcaming
On the hills of Albany.

Oh. the, N. Y. S. C. ’l‘. and its hlootn-

And this I say in parting, " Hung the
man who busted me.”

Take the hack to dear old Delmar
where my doting daddy dwells,

l’ttr away from that State College and
its bunch of hlootniuu hcllcs.

'l‘ltcrc let me soltly :tlumhcr in tlte
