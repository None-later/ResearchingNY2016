TO FUTURE TEACHERS

The writer of this letter is a boy
of twenty, who has had live years
of English in school. lle has
eagerly seized all opportunities for
further English study outside of
school hours. The letter gives his
lirst impressions of Manehnria,
where he is studying.

Sep. 23th, 1917.
Dear Miss -———-, Santa:

i received your letter with many
thanks and joy or gladness. How
happy you are! It, is happy to live
with family, alter long ahscnco. lt
is natural that your tlict‘cs joy to
you. Reading: your letter on which
happyness of home is represented,
l have eotton homesick, I could
not read it without recalling my
little brothers. '

I am studyingr engineering. De—
sian is inturtiug to me but it is
very painful. Dynamics, cugin and
chemistry are inlct‘csting too. I

it is curious to see Chinese
women. They have very tiny feet
in the shape of A, about 5”-(i” in
length. 'l‘hcy have rings on their
cars, which used to hung: beautiful
halls, 'l'hcy married at I: or 13 or
Lt or 15 years old, most of them
so. So that they have no pleasure
time as a girl. 'l'hcy scents to he
treated like an animal. 1 think one
of the most miserable in the World
is a chincat: woman.

The lower classes of chincsc is
very mis’crahlc one, 'l'hey live with
pigs in a dirty ntnddmt, and that.
it: is hotter kind of labourer who
have a house to live. Most of the
kurii, chinese laln'iurrr, have no
hut to live” One night i wont to
lshi Saudo see the moon. llut [

old battery, so that on the Way
home i lost my home way.

I saw a some lilack hody in my
way. At lirst l thonng it was a
stone. lllll‘ to my surprise i found
it a man. i went on, and i found
many man herc and there. They
all laid on the stone and [)ClllCS cx-
pose their hndy in the silvery moon
liuht. After that i heard they have
no house to live, and have no
family. They spend day and night
in open air. They say that they
can spend a day with only 5 son.
if we went to ClllthSt‘. village. we
will ﬁnd that all the chinese from
old man to child are smoking.
('hildren come around us and ask
