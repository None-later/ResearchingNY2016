RECITAL OF v
WAR POETRY

Dr. Thompson, Assisted by Mrs.
James Taafe, Entertains
Promethean

One of the most enjoyable as
well as profitable evenings ever
spent by the society, was at its
last meeting, Thursday evening of
last week. The entire program
was in charge of 'Dr. Harold
Thompson, of the English depart-
ment, assisted by Mrs. James
Taafe, alto soloist at the First
Presbyterian church. The subject
of the evening was ” War Poetry."

l'resitlcnt Margaret Shevliii pre-
sided at the meeting. After an‘
nouncing that the next meeting of
l’romethean would occur on March
seventh, and that election of oili-
cers for the second semester wotild
take place at that- timc. shc intro-

introduction, Dr. Thmllpsoll said
that he did not intend to present a
lecture. but rather wished to
present: a few examples of the dif-
ferent types of poetry that the war
has brought out among the Allies.

As a keynote to the whole pro-
gram, Dr. 'l‘hoi'npson read fials-
worthy's “ Courage." Next lol<

spirit of each of the countries on.

this same subject. England was
best: represented by Kipling, whose
poetry first gave us the word
“Him” in its present usage. Dr.
f’iulcy’s poem, “The Red Cross
Spirit Speaks," is an excellent illus—
tration of the American spirit.
After this was read, Mrs. Taafe
sang the selection, as set to music
by l-foratio Parker of Yale. Two
'I‘r‘rench poems, “Vine L‘lirancc”
and “The Soul of Joan D’Arc,"
were next read. The latter cx-

Professor Risley ’ Addresses
Student Body

 

Tries Interesting Historical Experiment —William The
econd’s Verdun Addres-

Oii Friday morning, February
22d, Student Assembly was opened
by Doctor Briibaclier. "America ”
was sung. Doctor llruhacher then
introduced Professor A. W. Risley,
who had been liftineg chosen to
speak to the student body at the
joint commemoration of VVashing~
ton’s and Lincoln’s birthdays.

l'rofcssor lx‘is'ley's subject was
“Made in America.” .llc pleaded
for the celebration of all national
holidays. and urged especially the
study of Lincoln’s fietlysbnrg ad-
dress each 12th of February.

llc declared that a new em-
phasis on our Revolution could be
gained from the present experi-
ence of Russia with llolslieviki. lle
styled Wt Iiiigton “a very pros-
perous looking gentleman,” say-

    

ing, “it is a part of our valuable

inheritance that our Revolution
was not left to the lower classes,
that a prosperous looking gentle-
man with other prosperous ones
like Alexander Hamilton, were our
leaders. We had our Bolsheviki,
soap box curators, radicals desiring
a change, little matter what sort,
the populistic element, but these
were not the class of men to whom
we entrusted the task of forming
an enduring government. Lct tis
be proud of the things we have,
no longer minimizing the dignity,
conservatism and solid information
of a Washington, nor the cou-
striictivc financial genius of a
Hamilton.”

Mr. Risley then tried the his-
torical experiment of placing
words of \Villiam the Second in
Washington’s motith. with the
effect of bringing into bold relief
the difference between the two
men. “History is generally and
safely interpreted from the known,
but the known emerges from ob«
scurity when viewed in the light of
history as it was not, but as it
surely might have been. Take
away from Washington his sound
common sense and lack of sel
seeking, place upcurling mustaches
upon him, set him aloft as a sharer

with God of the secrets of the tiiii- ‘

verse, fill him with undying and un-
pitynu;r ambition, and instead of the
fatherly admonition and wise ad-

vice of the Farewell .Arldrcss, you.

will have the bombast of a \Vib
linm the Second. ﬂoor the
changed Washington, ‘ You Ameri-
cans have only one will, and that

is my will; there is only one law.,

and that is my law there is only
one master in this country, and

that is l. \Vhocver opposes me,‘

I shall crush to pieces,’ The lan-
guage of liberty is far different.
The real Washington says, ‘l hold
the maxim no less applicable to
public than private affairs, that
honesty is always the best policy.’
Honesty is so 'Made in America’
that it takes the place of necessity
in Germany."

Considering Washington’s policy
of neutrality, and the portions of
the Farewell Address which are the

 

present-day basis of non-interven-
tion, hlr. lx’isley said, “Non~inter-
veiitiou is self determinism, the
right of each people to develop in
its own way without outside inter-
ference. '

“ Viewing the present emphasis
on the personality of rulers, who
shall say that with a man of the
dictator stamp in the highest
UlllCC. with a military personage
leading a disallcetcd army, the
whole background of the Revolu-
liUll might not have. been tlisrcr
garded? it staggers the imagina—
tion to think of Washington as the
forerunner of Napoleon Bonaparte
and of William llolienzollcru, so
different from them was his whole
character. Let us glory _in our
possession as a national heritage of
the memory of the plain. country
gentleman, who longed for his cs—
tatcs even while in office, and who
rejoiced to go back to his farm,
his horses, his dogs, as soon as re-
lease from oftice came.

“A slight View of history as if.
was not makes us glad that our
lfather of his Comitry was neither
a radical nor a royalist."

Mr. Risley then regarded Lin—
coln in the light of present dc-
vclopments, saying that Lincoln's
attitude toward Seward's early ad—
vice now assumes a wholly new
aspect. "Seward urged Lincoln
to make foreign war as a ctire for
internal disscnsion, a policy in
favor with foreign rulers from
l-‘rcderick the Circat through Bis-
marck, to William the Second.
lint apparently this is not the kind
of policy made in America, for
Lincoln never gave it a second
thought. The sole recourse of
Germany was totally foreign to
Lincoln’s character and to Ameri-
can genius.”

The Gettysburg Address was
lauded for its universality, its
special application to democracy
today—particularly as Lincoln
spoke in the closing sentence,
” That this government of the
people, by the people, and for the
people shall not perish from the
earth," Mr. Risley, then, by a dar-
ing paraphrase of the address cm-
phasized Lincoln's patriotism. “ sci:
us imagine that the Kaiser is de—
livering an address at the battle
ﬁeld of Verdun, spoken with his
customary bonrhast, irreverence,
and lack of respect for popular
government, it would have been
a physical and psychological im-
possibility for him to have thought
out one line of an address of the
sort’ Lincoln gave. Lincoln’s was
made in America.

“ I‘. .such an occasion as we
have imagined, William the Second
might have spoken thus: ‘Two—
score and eight years ago. my an-
cestors brought forth on this con-
tinent a new nation. conceived in
autocracy and dedicated to the pro-
position that I am it. Now we are en-
gaged in a great illegal war, test-

25 Defeat in Hard Fought Game

Superior passwork and shooting
enabled the Pratt Institute quintet
to defeat the defenders of State
College in the Albany High
School gymnasium, Saturday last.
l’ratt‘s victory was a spectacular
one, {our of their field baskets
being made from inidconrt. The
contest was one of the best ever
seen on the High School court,
and although the home team went
down to defeat it was not until it
llllll put up the hardest kind of a
fight and displayed a good brand
of basketball.

l‘ratt was the lirst to score,
Captain Van Lcyen scoriugfrom

the whistle blew. Fitclson soon
followed with a ﬁeld basket, and

for State College by dropping one
in from the foul line. Both teams
added to their score by baskets
from the penalty line. With the
score 8-3 against State, Fitz came

VARSITY GOES ON NEW
YORK TRIP THIS
WEEK

Purple and Gold to Play Man-
hattan, Pratt and Stevens

Manager Sutherland will take
his basketball warriors on their
New York trip this week. The
boys will leave Albany early
Thursday noon, and play Man-
hattan in New York Thursday
night. Coach Maroney predicts a
victory over Manhattan, because
the h‘lauhallan-Stalc College game
played here was won by only a
two-point margin. Coach Maroney
deserves great credit for the big
improvement in the team since the
beginning of the season. He has
worked wonders with the available
material at the College. Speaking
of the matter recently, he said,
“They are the best bunch of fel~
lows 1 ever handled. They're al-
ways fighting and ready to take
any suggestions, and that counts :1
whole lot."

Friday night will find the State
College defenders lined up against
Pratt Institute. Previous to their
northern trip, the Pratt five had
won nine straight games.

Captain Fitz and his men will
clash with Stevens institute Satur-
day night. The I-loboken quintet
have been meeting with great suc-
cess this season, having won
eleven straight games.

The trip will certainly be a
tiying one, as three games in a
row is hard for any team. How-
ever, if the team keeps up the
record of its recent northern trip, the
best record made of all trips taken,
the time and effort will have been
well spent.
