NEW PLAN FOR DISTRI-
BUTION OF THE
" NEWS "

Owing to some dissatisfaction
with the present manner of weekly
distribution of the “News,” a new
method is adopted with the cur-
rent issue. As soon as received
on Wednesdays, the "News" will
be placed on tables outside the
Publication Ofﬁce. From this
supply each student may take the
copy he or she is entitled to. with-
out going through the formality of
presenting a blanket tax card. The
Board advances this plan to solve
the present problem, and feels
assured that the individual and
collective honor of the students
will be equal to the occasion.
Faculty copies will be delivered as
usual.

TO CONTRIBUTORS

It is requested that anyone hand-
ing in articles for publication con-
taining names of present or former
students, shall add after each name
the class numerals Of the person.

 

Owing to lack of space the Col-
lege Calendar is omitted from this
issue. The Calendar will be found
posted on both bulletin boards.

SENIORS WIN EXTRA
PERIOD CONTEST

Fresh Drop in Last Place in

Inter-Class Games

Mondayhthe eighteenth, marked
the ﬁrst big change in the stand—
ing of the teams in the inter«class
games. The Fresh met the Seniors
and went: down to defeat in the
hardest fought game ever seen on
the court.

The Seniors were the ﬁrst to
score and they held their lead
throughout the ﬁrst half. Town-
send, Lobdell and Sauei'brei were
responsible for the Senior counts
in this half. Hawthorne, the big
Freshmen center, scored the only

Frosh points. When the whistle

 

was sounded at half time, the
Seniors were leading 9-4.

The second half opened with the
Freshmen lighting furiously for
the lead. Field baskets by Rabiner,
.iucci and i'iawthorne soon placed
them there by a one point margin.
Dewey Townsend tied the score by
cagiug the ball from the foul line.
The Seniors again took the lead
when Dewey scored again from the
foul line. Rahincr tied the score,
making it 11-”, by counting from
the foul line just before the whistle
blew for the second half.

Owing to the factthat the score
was tied ‘at I! all, an extra ﬁve
minute period had to be played.
Saiierbrci brought the Seniors
ahead on a neat one-hand shot
from the side of the court. Rabiner
immediately tied things up again
by scoring a ﬁeld basket for the
Fresh. Dewey driliblcd the length
of the court and gave the Seniors
21 two point lead. The best the
Frosh could do, before the ﬁnal
whistle sounded, was to score from
the penalty line, making the ﬁnal
count, Seniors, i5; Frosh, I4.

STATE COLLEGE OBSER-
VES UNIVERSAL DAY
OF PRAYER FOR
STUDENTS

The ofﬁcers of the World's
Student Christian Federation ap-
pointed Sunday, February 24th as
the universal day of prayer for
students. Our college through the
Y. W. C. A. observed this day of
prayer by a meeting of the students
in the College Auditorium, Sunday
afternoon. Maud Rose led the
meeting, Mary Whish sang.

Many college students have an-
swered the call to arms and some
are “over there" now. Those
students remaining behind must do
all in their power to “keep the
home ﬁres burning." It was to
keep our minds open to this fact
that the day of prayer was held, to
pray for the students “over there,"
and over here, and for all those
who are leaders and teachers of
students.
