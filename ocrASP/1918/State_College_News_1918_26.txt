KYLE' ADAMS SPEAKS

Thursday afternoon the Y. W.
girls were treated to fifty minutes
radiation of Kyle Adnms’ fire {IIK
enthusiasm. Her talk was a chal-
lenge to the young womanhood of
America. She said there was no
need for girls to lament inability
to do their hit, with a khaki uni~
form to reward their efforts. Miss
Adams showed that the individual
contribution of each American girl
is just as valuable and just as
necessary .as that of the American
man. The speaker 'urged unity of

purpose and deepening of personal

consciousness and sincerity. A

‘very rousing climax was reached

when Miss Adams led the girls in
singing Over There." A novc
chorus with the theme “ Over
Here" was supplied by Miss
Adams.
