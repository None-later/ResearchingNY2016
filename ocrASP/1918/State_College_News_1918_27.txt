RECITAL OF WAR POETRY
Continued from page I
sang the popular song, ” My Boy."
The selection, " Wife of Flanders,”
wonderfully portrays the part that
Belgium has played throughout the
past three and one-half years.

The next natural division was
poetry describing incidents of the
war. To illustrate this kind, sev-
eral selections were read. Wilfred
Gibson's “ Between the Lines,” and
Robert W. Service's "Flcurette
were best. I

The spirit of peace is always
manifest in the minds of pea le
during wartime. The poetry of his
type which has come out during
the present struggle is hardly the
usual type. Instead of reading any
of this, Dr. ' hompson accom-
panied Mrs. Taafc in a vocal solo,
" Grant Us Peace," :1 modern rc-
vision of a seventeenth century
composition.

in closing, Dr. Thompson spoke
of the universal interest in a very
few masterpieces which have been
given to the public, The real
masterpiece of this period seems to
be the work of Lawrence llinyoun,
an English poet, entitled, " The
Spirit of England." The poem is
divided into three great move-
mcnts, as follows: " The Fourth of
August," “To Women,” am ” For
the Fallen." Sclcctions from each
of these were read, and then Dr.
Thompson played the symphony
written by Sir Edward Elgar for
the poem. The poem with its
musical setting is certain to bc<
COl‘llC an immortal classic.

LECTURES ON DEMOCRACY
Continued from Page .'

trance into the war locusscd the
attention of the civilized world
upon us and upon our govern—
mental ideals. Our Democracy, as
championed by President \Vilsnn,
has been acccptcd as a worthy
idea] by England, France and
ltaly; and Russia is even now
groping about in the darkness of
.rcvoluntionary chaos after this
same Democracy. Even Germany
comes forward With a claim that
she too has heard of Democracy
and even insists that she has made
it part of her system. The world
is ﬁghting for Democracy.

But What is Democracy? Can an

ideal of government embrace suclr

diversity of forms as are repre-
sented by the Allics’ governments?

The lccturcston Democracy by
the State College faculty will try
to answer some of the questions
that promptly arise when we think
of Democracy. The speakers will
try to interpret the various phases
of the subject, and will surely
stimulate our thinking on this
momentous matter.

 

RISLEY ADDRESSES STUDENTS

ing whether that nation or any
nation, so conceived and so dedi-
catcd can-long be endured. We
are met on a great battleﬁeld of
that war.’ We have come to dedi~
catc a portion of that ﬁeld as a
final resting place for cannon
fodder. It is altogether ﬁtting and
proper that I should say this.

"‘But. in a larger sense, they
cannot dedicate, they cannot con-
secrale, they cannot hallowthis
ground. The bravo mcn, living and
dcad, who struggled here, have
,consccratcd it far less than our
great power will do. The world
[will little note nor long remember
'what they did here, but let it dare
to forget what I say here. It is
for us the living, rather, to be
dedicated here to the unﬁnished
\work which my ancestors have
thus far so nobly advanced. It is

rather for Us to he here‘dedicnted
to tho great task rcmammg before

us—that from these honored

words you take increased devotion
to that task for which I have not
yet given the last full measure of.
words; that you here highly rc-
solve that I shall not have spoken
in vain; that this nation, under ME,
shall have a new birth of autoc-
racy; and that government of the
Hohenzollcrns, by the Hohcn-
zollcrns, and for the Potsdam gang,
shall not perish from the earth.’

" Let us thank God at least twice
a year for the blessing of living in
a country whose heroes are Wash-
ington and Lincoln, not Frederick
the Great and Bismarck."

Mr. Risley then spoke of the
difficulty of oodrow Wilson’s
present task, "Washington's prob-
lem was to make a nation free, Lin-
coln’s to keep a nation intact. But
Wilson must preserve a nation
from a foreign foe, and so manage
its internal affairs that we may be
leaders of foreign thought as we
always have been."

Mr. Rislcy deplored the whole—
sale optimism into which so many
of us have been lullcd. and urged
that we "ﬁght the kind of ﬁghting
that is made in America."

in closing, Mr. Rislcy suggested
that cach of us, as he or she enters
our college building, shall salutc‘
the. ﬂag that was made in America.
“The stars in that ﬂag stand for
our‘undividcd country, the red for
the blood shed by the boys of yes—
tcrday and today. the white for the
purity of our purpose, the blue for
the souls of men like the valiant
Washington and the martyred
Lincoln."
