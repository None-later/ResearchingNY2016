taiuly fortunate in having such an
authority on the subject as Miss Van
l,ie\v within its own doors.

Some people feel rather resentful
over the fact that we are constantly
sending food ahroad and going with-
out it ourselves, hut such people do
not realize the seriousness of the
situation. Miss Liew was
aliroad when the war started. She
reached l’aris almnt two weeks after
the French army was Innhilized. Ile-
fore reaching there. the only food oh—
one roll a meal and one
, liven in l’ar tit-re, was
enough food. America is in no
such condition as this. \Ve are in
no danger o s ration, hut we must
readjust our hahits of ealing.

“The food shortage did not clnnl.‘
with the w' nor will it end when
peace is declared.” The up; crop
was the third largest America has
ever produced. The one crop. how»
ever. was very small. 'l'herefm'e.
when the allies called for help, we
sent them some, of the former. The
citizen at; 1y must feed the army and
navy so that they can light the Kaiser.
We have adopted a huge familv, a
famin of alwut thirty million men,
and their families. They are lighting
our light and they can’t light and
provide at the same time. These
men are consuming frth go to do
per cent. more food than hefore,
hecause of their violent occupation.

America is in the practical shipping
d‘ 1e 0 the warring countriea.
They must have wheat, animal pro—
ducts and sugar. Formerly Russia
led the world in the production of
wheat. hut she herself Consumed live»
sixths, leaving only one- xth to he
she has none for
t . The .-\llies consumed
ahont one hillion hushels. six hundred
million of which they produced.
Their 19:7 crop was deﬁcient, and
they need 550,000,000 hushels. They
used to import wheat from the United
States. Canada. .-\rgcntina. lndia.

‘r'dia, Cuha and Java. Of all
supplies are only available now
the United States and Canada.
The surplus of these two countries
together is so small that there is still
a shortage of ahout 320.ooo,ono hush-

 

 

      

    

 

  

  
 

 

  
  

eis. If we save one pound a week we
can lower this delirit to about 150.-
eoo,ooo hushels. We can do this by
using as snhstitutes corn. oats. buck
the soldiers must he that which we
do without.

The demand for meat has in-
creased hecause there are more men
and wotuen in active industries who
therefore require more. The source
of supply has, on the contrary.
diminished because. the shortage of
lahor, the high price of feed, the lack
of fertilizer and the low price of milk
have made it more protitahle for peo»
pic. to kill their cattle than to keep
them. (lnr meat export is now
douhle what it was in the three years
previous to the war. We send pork
to the warring- countries hccause it is
easily preserved, lends itself to coin—
merrial handling readin (for exam-
ple. hacon and ham). and is rich in
fat. Something must he done to stop
the wholesale Slaughter of heeves.
We tnust have dairy products for
children. sick soldiers and for meal:
suhstitutes for all. In fiermany hut-
ler is K s a pound and mil: 5o cents
a l|llttll. We are exporting an enor—
mous amount of dairy products. three
times Is much hulter as in the three
year pr 4—war period, elet't‘tl times as
use and nine times as much
condensrd milk.

 

 

r:

Sugar was the first thing affected
by the war. More than one—half the
heel sugar of the world used to come
from liermany, .'\nstria and RIL. .1.
Now the shortage of 2,000,000 tons
must come from new sources. Our
country has llt'f‘ll consuming one-fifth
of the world’s sugar production,
eighty-live pounds per capita per year
or four ounces a day. l’rance has
only consumed twenty—one pounds
per captla per year. We are asked
to save one ounce a day.
enahle us to send |.mo.ooo tons per
year over there. We have no actual
food shortage now. The high prices
are due to a demand for the surplus.
which is less than usual. This has
lead to speculation.

  

\\"e've got to feed our allies and
ourselves now. and perhaps, after the
war, our enemies. :\ntoerac_v thinks
that we are too sellishlv individual—

The war tactics of the

that of the army of fighters. The
strength of the men at the front de-
pends on us!
