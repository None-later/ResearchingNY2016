A PRAYER FOR THE .
NEW YEAR

BY DEAN HORNER

Give us here in this College, we
pray Thee, Almighty God, as we
go about our humble tasks, an
awakened realizing sense of the
poricntious import of the New
Year which lies before us. Help
us somehow to understand that
our all—our heritage and our
future—is wrapped up inevitably
in the unfolding days, weeks,
lllOlltllS—ycal‘s it may lie—that
are to come.

lustil no “hymn of hate in our
hearts, no thirst for blood, no
desire for revenge, no dream of
conquest. Rather help us to think
often and with fruitful purpose of
the rights of little children, cold,
hungry, desolate little children who
feel the pinch of war the world
over. Keep us mindful—for it is
already our portion—«of desc-
cratcd shrines, stricken homes, and
maimed soldiers. Let the spirit of
the Red Cross permeate our
thought and action day by day.

And while the whole world is
sad help us to go about, for thus
we can best serve it and Thee,
with such light hearts, hopeful
faces, and cheerful vorccs as we
can command. Teach us how to
sacriﬁce, gladly, wtllingly, intelli-
gently, Give our calling new
dignity and higher resolve as it
faces new purpose. Help us to
make the day's work count not
only for ourselves but also for all
mankind for whom we have taken
up the sword; and let no one of
us forget that his day’s work
honestly done, faithfully (lone, un-
selfishly done, carries the nation
forward. V

Permit us a just pride in the line
spirit of loyalty to state and nation
which characterizes us and help us
daily to remember the bravery and
patriotic zeal of our own number
who even now carry that spirit to
the battle line. They are our
visible offering. We would giye
ourselves— we do pledge ourselves
——as wdlmgly.

Give us speedin to know that
there is no turning back, no devi-
atinn from the straight path ahead
of us, and no compromise with
modern barlrirism.

Bring peace to the world in 1918
if it is Thy will; but teach us, even
in the face of this mighty holocaust
of war. to pray fervently that
peace, at whatever cost, shall not
come until it may come with justice
and with promise of endurance,

Shrill bugle blasts, beating
drums, the tramp, tramp, tramp of
marching feet, and the new year is
ushered in, to Time. But the 1918
cherub Wears doughboy shoes over
his pink toes, and a khaki uniform,
instead of a pair of wings and a
mass of curls. Do we see an old,
bent, haggard form leaning on a
cane, and passing out of the ﬁeld
of vision with slow palsicd step?
Ah no. 1917 wears khaki, too,—
somewhat worn perhaps. Hlsillnir
is grizzled, but his form defies age
and is crccl, soldicrly. Just so his
spirit. Hard set jaws and eyes of
steel-like determination, tell of ex-
periences that were costly. He
hands his rifle to the new
young soldier, right~about faces,
and matches on. As he goes—we
are aware that it is dark; dark all
around us. There's an inspiring
gleam in the young soldier’s eyes—-
he sees something we do not.
There’s more than mere darkness
for hiln. His eyes are trained,«—
he has a vision for he is LOIS; we
are still in the darkness of 1917.
We fail to see a streak of light
thru this darkness, but can we not
remember that the darkness which
just precedes dawn is more intense
than any other hour of the night?
Ve are young in the experience of
what war brings and therefore
know not what we see. Our
vision is not sharpened as to our
own individual parts in the great
struggle, list a few do not try
hard to see“ Now as we salute
H.118, we must sharpen our vision
and give it a chance. There is
light, if we but know how to see it.

Every failure, every weak spot
must serve its purpose as an
example of what to avoid in the
future. We must make our college
more and more a part of the world
of big things. The “gown " must
become a part of the “town.”
Humanity is undergoing much——
among other things, taking a
“collegiate course in war."

New Year resolutions coine—
aud go. like a blaze of magnesium.
They seldom burn deeply. instead
of resolving to make the world
over by batting our heads against
a stone wall, let us get a vision. A
vision—that is keen enough to see
a streak of light, even thru the
smoke and mud and gases, “over
there.’l cs, get a vision, and then
advance toward that streak of light
in the east!

ATTENTION. SANDWICH
EATERS!

 

Don't you tire of eating dry,
tasteless sandwiches for lunch?

you know there was such a place
here at College? The Junior
Cookery Class serves lunch every
day except Saturday in the base-
ment of the Science Building.
They do this primarily to gain ex—
pericncc in the manipulation of
food materials, but anyone may
take advantage of this opportunity
offered, by signing on the list
posted on the main bulletin board.
Above the list is stated the date,
menu for the day, tilnc of serving,
cost, and number of people that
can be accommodated. The time
is five minutes past twelve, and
the cost from twenty to twenty-
lii'e cents, Anyone desiring to
become a regular attcnilaiil at these
lunches may make arrangements
aud'thns forch the formality of
signing.

’l‘hc lunches nrc ‘snbsiantinl
meals. well prepared, well served,
and always contain at least one hot
dish. Here are some of the menus
that have lccn served already this
year: c lopcd salmon, rofiec,
bran muffins, sweet pickles, prune
whip: vcgclablc chop sncy, bran
gems, maple nut custard, wafers,
(ca: scalloped oysters, g'aham
bri'ad, cclcry. pincapplc gclatinc,
lea; rrram of celery soup, scltllnpcd
rice and ci‘ullisb. cornmeal rolls,
coffcr, cornstarch pudding, choco-
kilo saiicc: tomato soup, codlish
cakes. chow-chow, graham bread,
fruit compote,

Students who Illli'lt‘l‘~llillll'lsll
lhcmsclvcs physically cannot hope
to be cflicicnt mentally. Do not let
another day go by without becom-
ing acquainted with the advantage
open to you. iicc having known
the ioy of the absence of that
hnmzrv feeling about three o'clock,
yrnr will never bring a cold lunch

again.

 

 

To the Editor of State College
News:-

flaring read the editorial of the
last issue of the News éntitled,
” Have You a Carlson?” i wish to
call in the attention of those
interested in acquiring godsons to
the following announcement in the
New York papers of last week.

(icncral Pershing urged that the
Soldiers‘ Godmother League cease
its organized attempt to introduce
into the American Army the insti-
lnliou of bllcul and marrainc. His
chief reason is that the correspond-
eni'c between the soldiers in France
and their godmothers on our side
of the water would clog the trans-
portation of necessary mail
supplies. His second reason is that
be docs not want his soldiers Corre-
sponding with strange women.

it seems to inc that State College
letterwriting girls had better heed
General Pershing's request
thus save our soldiers from
cmbarrasing positions. These god-
son seekers do not do this because
they are fired with so much
patriotic zcal but on the other hand
these girls rather like the mild ex-
citement of receiving their ﬁrst
letter frqu a man. It makes no
difference whether that man is in
France, Hawaii or Albany, “'l’ro~
prictics as usual " is a good slogan.

Respectfully yours,
May Flower.

The Editor of the "State College
’ icws”:

Dear Sir.-~ What is the highest
compliment that can be paid? f
:ave wondered about it often, and
only recently did i discover the
answer.

i opened the package from State
('ollcge on Christmas morning.
Home made fruit cake and stuffed
dim-5 and jam and ginger bread—-
didn't it all look great? So i called
in tile four or live men who work
with the in the I'ost Exchange,
chums and " buukics” for the time
being, and invited them to fall to.
(if course, i did too.

()nc of those men was a general
prisoner—a soldier who had been
mnrt martialcd and sentenced to
the military prison on (invcrilor's
island. ('onscuucully, he had not
seen his friends or his home, had
not had any luxuries for over a
year, .\nd zlfli'r he had eaten his
share of the fruit cake and the
jam, hc linokcd at me and said.
“ loy, that tastes like home."

.\nd ibcrc you havi- it, My poor
and i('l‘lllL' i'il‘nrls in Illanlt lllt‘
aritlly and students of. State ['of
loge for their interest and their
good wishes sink into insignilirauri'
hcsidc that phrase: “ toy, that
tastes like home.” And the best I
can do is It! adopt them as my own.
“Ladies and gentlemen, i thank
you for the taste of home you gave
me.”

Sincerely yours,
