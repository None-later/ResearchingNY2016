EDITORIALS

We really have hope tliat_sprlng is
coming; Barnum and Bailey’s ad-
vance agents are in town.

Three of a kind will beat two pairs
in poker, but not in basketball when
the pairs are Maroney and Suthera
land, Barry and Fitz.

A home game with the Massachu—
setts Aggies will close a season dur<
ing which our team has often been
beaten, but never defeated.

We wonder if the 30«niinutc lunch-
eon period, ﬁlled with class and com—
mittee meetings, was invented by
Hoover.

 

How many War Saving Stamps do
you have?

CONTINUE EFFICIENCY

The " News ” desires to congratu-
late Promethean and its president,
Margaret Shcvlin, upon the efficient
work which they have done during
the past semester. The meetings have
been digniﬁed and were conducted to
carry out its educational and literary
aim. The programs rendered have
enabled State College students to en‘
joy excellent music and literature
” without money and without price,”
and so have filled a pressing need to
the many students who have sacrificed
music and theatre to war-giving.

Since the constitution of Prome-
thean determines that its ofﬁcers shall
be changed each semester, it is the
duty of each member to be present
Thursday night to see that oﬂicers
who will continue the present efficient
policy are selected.

HAVE WE FAILED?

Some three weeks ago a Smileagc
Campaign was inaugurated at State
liege, as a result of which seven-
teen dollars has been received. Since
' our registmtion is practically eight
hundred students. it means that we
have given on the average a little
better than _-two cents per capita.

. May it not be worth our while to try
to ascertain why we have so miser-
ably fallen down in this matter?
Since entering college last fall there
5 been one continuous demand for
money. We have given to the ,Stu-
dents' Friendship War Fund, to ,to-
bacco funds, .to the
nished boxesand bought bonds and
thrift stamps. We have denied our-

Red Cross, fnr- '

 

selves (which is well) and continually
solicited funds from our parents,
many of whom have had these same
charities to meet at home. At the
some time we hear of millions of (lol-
lars being spent for tobacco, and
army ofﬁcers tell us that the men are
smoking so much that they are actu-
ally injuring themselves. 'In the
theatres and other places of amuse~
nient we see numbers of soldiers
spending more money than ever be-
fore. We learn of men earning be-
fore entering the army $50 per month
now receiving from $360 and main.
tenancc to $2,100 per year, and 0f the
government contractors making $9,-
ooo,ooo commissions. We are not
lacking in respect and honor for our
soldier boys, hilt when we realize that
the war, from present appearance,
.may continue for several years yet,
may it not be well to conserve some of
our energies for two or three years
from now? Have we fallen down or
are we acting in the light of reason?

‘ARE WE EQUAL TO IT?

Last Wednesday a goodly number
T. students showed their
professional instincts by attending the
hearing on the Township School Bill.
They were afforded a splendid op-
portunity to catch a glimpse of an
attitude which they will need to com-
bat in later years, not alone in rural
districts, but in cities as well,——and
incidently some dozen or so of Pro—
fessor Kirkland’s fallacies.

We wonder how many of these
future teachers asked themselves if
they will or could have a part in
overcoming rural prejudice and bet-
tering rural conditions. There is no
doubt but that added expense is the
farmers‘ main objection to the pres-
ent school law. When we take into
consuleration, however, that in the
majority of those 3,800 school dis-
tricts mentioned is employed a young
girl teacher, usually between 18 and
25, with an education not much in
'excess of the ﬁrst two years of high
school and a year in a training class,
and with a ” heart interest ” “to teach
long enough to buy some clothes to
get married in." we are better enabled
to understand the shouts of last
Thursday. Add to this a district su-
perintendent who Visils his schools
often enough and long enough to de-
liver the animal report and sign the
aegister. and _we do not wonder that

12mg” 15 misunderstood.

If State College can instil into its
graduates ideals lofty enough and
strong enough to go forth and com-
bat these conditions, to strive to raise
the qualiﬁcations for rural teachers,

schools as a city experiment station,

OPPORTUNITY

When you graduate from college
you will he thought of by many as a
person who is educated. But when
you begin to talk with people you
will- show your narrow fund of
knowledge and interests. Should an
educated person be well versed on his
major and minor subjects of college
only, and be allowed to feel that he
may excuse his ivnorance and lack of
interest on all other subjects, seine of
which are really vital to his own
existence and welfare?

College life lasts only four years.
Your interests are narrowed and in-
tensified in the time of life when
you should he broadening your inter-
ests. You should make use of every
opportunity to inform yourself on all
subjects that interest the mind of
man. Especially is this true of us
who are planning to become edu-
cators. All educators should help
their pupils to find life interesting
and helpful in developing potential
capacities. Can a narrow person do
tiis.

Have you found all the avenues of
activity by which you may be useful
to society and through which you
may demand the regard and respect
of your fellows? Why not make use
of the opportunities offered here in
college

Why do you deprive yourself the
opportunity for broadening your in-
terest and development of leadership
in the College Club, the most cosmo-
politan organization in college? lt
interests itself in all activities ofman.
Make use of the lectures which are
to be given under its auspices by the
faculty. You do yourself and your
college an injustice when you absent
yourself from such meetings. Show
our professors that their labors in
our behalf are appreciated and made.
