PROFESSOR MAHAR

ADDRESSES NEWMAN

CLUB

Speaker Shows Importance of

eltlc History

Newman Club held its regular incul—
int.r last Friday. A committee was
appointed to arrange for the New
man Dance, to be held April 13.
llr~causc of the lectures on Democ-
racy, the club meetings have been
changed to the ﬁrst Wednesday of
the month at 4:10, instead of the
first Friday,

Professor John Maliar, the
speaker of the afternoon, gave a
most interesting account of Ireland
and her early history. The Irish
are the main representatives of the
Celtic branch of the Inclo~Europeau
family, who migrated to Europe
about 2000 R. C., before any other
people. This is shown by the fact
that the important rivers in Ger-
many, France, Ireland, England
and Spain bear Celtic names. The
Celts were early famed for their
power and their education. They
traveled through Africa to Spain.
hlilesins, who migrated from Spain
to ireland in i698 B. C., is the
ancestor of the present Irish race.
The dynasty founded by him lasted
until the coming of the Anglo-
Norniaii,——2,85o years,—-—it is the
oldcst of all dynasties that have
ever existed.

In a future lecture Prof. Mahar
expects to discuss Irish literature
more fully.

PROFESSOR WALKER

the Association of Collegiate Alumnae
