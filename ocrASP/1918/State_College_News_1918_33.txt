DR. RICHARDSON
DELIVERS FIRST DE~
MOCRACY' LECTURE

The faculty lecture series began
Friday when Dr, Leonard W.
lx’ichardson spoke on “|,)eiuocracy
and the individual." it seems par.
ticnlarly fitting that the tirst lee—
ttn'e should be given by the most
revered professor on the faculty.
His innate love for truth, learning.
and the principles for which a trtie
scholar lives, make his words more
forcible with such a background to
strengthen them,

Dr. Richardson traced the
growth of democracy in linglaud,
and the greater improvement. nti
America's inheritance, discussing
the comparison of government in
the two countries. In speaking of
way" of manifestation of tile demo-
eratie spirit, |)r. Iticliardsmi said
that America was not synlpltlhelit'
with an established church but be-
lieved in the right of private ,ludg~
ttlt'tll. The attempt to interpret the
visible world in its relation to man
is distinctly detiiorratie. A third
manifestation is the American
habit ol free inquiry, The speaker
stated that there is no eivnillt'l be-
tween science anti religion and that
this belief will be strengthened by
the awakening that is to come.
“We must meet the emergencies of
tlie eiiiergieucies

 
 

 

   

 

the present as

\rere met in the past," said Dr.
Hi, =ardson. “We must bear the
brunt of purest war. ' ruse

   

of civilization versus
liberty Versus despotism. Will we
permit the spirit of tierniany to
prevail or shall we do what we can
to make the world sale lur democ—
t‘zlt'yv by paying the price.”

of the Exchange Department until
taking up the new duties here at
State College.

()ur former registrar, Miss Edith
todley, retired from active. schIce
the lirst part of February. The
students who know this unusual
woman will hilly agree with Dr.
lirubaeher's sentiments: “Miss
llotllcy has retired after tliirty-two
years of loyal amt faithful service
to the college. probably no one is
so well and kindly renterbered by
the students who have passed
through the institution between
1H85—iiii7. She was a friend to
everyone. and had the interests
at the students and the college at
heart."
