I’rcslnneu had more workers than
any other class. The Seniors were
represented by all of nine. Is it
lli‘L'illlsc the lircshmeu have more

WHAT IS To BE 0011 92'

Last week the Board tried a new
system of distributing the State
College News. The copies were
placed in the hall and the students
merely had to help themselves.
This method was employed so that
forgetful students who had paid
their BlankctrTax should receive
the paper due them without going
through a lot of red tape. This
method also seems advisable since
the members of the Board were not
always able to be in the publication
ofliec to accommodate the student's.

However, we find that this
method is not entirely satisfactory.
It seems rather hard that the ma.
jority of the student hotly should
suffer inconveniences just because
a few unloyal students have not
paid their Blanket Tax. However,
Myskania decrees, “ inasmuch as
thirty people have uot'pairl their
Tax the publications must not he
put outside on the table." It is
quite evident that Myskauia is
right.

We put it up to you, Student‘

Ilody, can you suggest any easy
method of distributirm? For the
next few weeks the Publication
()llice Will be open all Wednesday
afternoon for giving out papers.

More Leaders Needed for Democ-
racy Discussion Units

 

The college sltldeuls are re-
quested to “sign up " under the
topics concerning democracy in
which they are most interested.
'l'licse lists are posted on the main
bulletin board. A few capable
students hayc voluulered as group

leaders lull more are needed. The
following leaders and topics have
already been selected: .
_ . ahe Albee, 'Il'i—Womau. and
Democracy.

Agnes Moore, ’18—Society and

Detuucracy.
Lillian Hussy,
and liduralion.
l'n'act' Smith, yIii—«Religion and
l’olilics.
Marian Moore—Religion and De-
mocrucy.

To the liditor:

Moving-up day should he a time
of rejoicing for the Student llody.

.\lost of the Juniors think of if as
:1 day when there is u long, long
proc anion, marching up the audi-
torium platform and down the
steps on the other side, for most
of the Juniors will march down‘ou
[be other sidev Is the honor and
happine's givrn to ten members of
the class who are, as it were,
caught up in to heaven, worth the
feelings of lbc opposite nature that
the ninety or more must feel?
Most of us like lo invite our
friends to watch the festivities that
day—«but l wonder how many
Juniors will do it this year?

isn’t there some way in which
the future members of Myskauia
could bc as much honored, without
over-cmpbasizing the number of
tl osc who are lcft over? Would it
not be much more exciting if that
dignilied body should leave the
platform, just once. choose its
future members from among the
audience, and accompany them to
the platform?

This letter is merely a sugges-
lion to the student burly as a whole.
'l‘l‘ink it over! If the entire stu—
dent body agree with' the ideas
here expressed, its opinion must
surely count for somclhing!

FORMER INSTRUCTOR
CLUB ON ANTITOXINS

At the Chemistry (Ilub Friday
aflerntnm. March 1, current topics
were given by Mr. Kennedy and
l’rofcssor llronaou. Miss Dal
read a poem written by N. V.
L‘lutc, :1 former member of Chem-
istry Lflub, now stationed at Spar—
lanbnrg. '

Mr. Chester Wood, former .m-
structor of Chemistry at Statutol-
lege, now employed at the State
Bacteriological Laboratory, gave a
lecture. on "Antitoxin." lle dealt
to some extent on the subject of
iuuuunity. There are two kinds
of immunity—active and passive.
Active imuutnity is obtained by
having the disease; passive, by
being injected with the antibodies
produced in the body of a diseased
animal.

In rnakim.r diibthcria antiioxiu,
diphthcria is protncrd in the horse.
in 111:4 the new id -11 was to take the
blood plasma from the animal and
concentrate it by fractional precipita-
tion with runouinnt sulphate, liy this
procch simply lhe psetuloglolndius.
antitoxiu aml albumins are obtained.
The aniittwiu alone is then obtain l
by precipitating the psetuloglohulius
and nlbumius. After it is made the
.uuiloxlu is stcl‘ilizrd, ctutccntraled,
filtered through paper pulp and llcrk-
lcldt fillers and‘diolysed. 'l'lte dialys<

Mr. Wood was well qualified to
lecture on this subject, since he is

THE GYM FROLIC

About a hundred girls including
Miss l'icrce and .\li.s firay at-
tended the gym frolic Friday night.
The stunts were unusually gout]
and were thoroughly enjoyed by
tl-c audience. Mae 'l'auzy’s aes-
thetic dancing was most fetching.
Imagine while robed airy dancers
bravely enacting some very clever
doggri‘cl composed by Mac 'l‘nuzy
b If and read by the inimitable
K lhcrine La lx’osc, otherwise
designated, master of ceremonies.
Here's to you, Mac.

The big affair was a basketball
game—the real series game be-
tween the Seniors and brush. lu
spite of a hard light which held
the half time score to 1} to 7, the
l’rnsh lost badly by a final srore
of .‘lS lo 27. llut the Freshmen are
sports. they play bravely, they lose
gallanlly. Some day they will win
gloriously.

Later Miss Pierce spoke to the
girls on the subject of clmngint.r
to W. A, A. 'l‘be volc. taken as
the girls went out, was against the
change, so the olllcial title remains
G. A. A.

Miss (Tobi) introduced her snbicct
by the astounding statement that
in New York State alone there are
a half—million aliens over 21 years
of age, 400.1200 of these being
illiterate. It is the problem of tie

the names of books very uuu'h

amples of this were the room t:

Days of Frappe." “Venus Adnoids"
and “Uncle 'l‘om's l'lavcliu."

Through the medium of the chil-
then the parents are Father easily
reached. The real problem is to
leach those who are too old or too
lazy to learn. The libraries try to
supply these with the best litera-
ture from their own country and
secure their interest by the means
of movies with the natiouai SnllL..
