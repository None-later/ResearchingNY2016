The Junior-Soph contest was the
only interclass game played last

Seniors were unable to get their

Senior—lirosh game was postponed
to a later date. in the Junior-Soph
game the Sophs were the tirst to
score, and they maintained their
lead throughout. but were never
far enough ahead to make them
feel sure of victory.

Very soon after the contest was
under way, the Sophs jumped into
the load by scorinr,r once from the
held and foul line in rapid succes-
sion. ("astallano made the first
score for the juniors by counting
from the foul line. lloth tcanH
scored again, Merchant and Whit-
nt-y cach being,r credited with a ﬁeld
bas-kct. The Sophs finally found
their stride and had little difficulty
in keep the ball in their possession.
At this point the Juniors defense
went to pieces and it was not long,’
hclorc the Sophs added six more
points to its lead. four points being
made by Carson on llL‘l(l goals.
The l‘alf ended [14, in favor of the
