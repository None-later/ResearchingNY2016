THE ORIGIN OF DEMOCRACY

 

Dr. Hutchinson Given Second
Lecture of Faculty Series

(in Friday afternoon at. four
o'clock occurred the second lecture
in the facility series. when Dr.
David Hutchinson discussed the
"Oripin of Democracy.“ [fe be«
can with Aristotle‘s deliuition of
democracy which says that it is a
government in which supreme
power is indeed in the whole
people or a majority of the people,
Two kinds of denmcracy occurred
in Greece, pure or direct democra-
cy. and federal democracy. The
first in its most complete form is
found in the records of the Grecian
('ity Slate. The reforms of Drace.
Solon. chisthcncs and l‘criclcs
perfected this democracy in
.\thcns. 'l‘ht-tuistoclcs inunted the
caucus which came into great
prmninrnce and was in constant
use. The recall provided for re—
calling offic'ils who were for any
reason unsatisfactory, and an op-
portnnity was given every thirty—
si\' days to put the machinery of
the recall in operation. Contrary
to the general opinion, recent in—
vestigation has shown that repre‘
sentation was in constant use, a: in
the Council of Athens.

 

'l'he democracy which has spread
over the whole world. and for
which the. whole world is lightinr
to-day, is true representative de~
originated in
England. In this we have repre-
sentative govcrmueut, appointed
hr, and responsible to the people.
There are two things to consider
in the development of this form of
L'overnment. First. the use of the
lin'l'lish parliament Second. the
triumph of the legislature over the
crown. Parliament was practically
completed by 1203. The struggle
between (‘rmvn and Parliament
was complicated by the doctrine
of divine riubtmbrnueht in by
[antes First. The attempt to en—
force this doctrine brought on the
Fivil \Var and the, Tlcvolulion of
1683. resulting in the complete and
final victory of the Legislature

.over the Crown, The conflict be-

tween the two was harmonized in
the, cabinet. or executive commit»

'tec of England, which is appointed

by and responsible to the majority
of Parliament. A recent custom
holds that the cabinet is immedi-
ately responsible to Parliament, as
the lialfonr Ministry of 1005.

\Vhat power has the King? Tie
has the right to be consulted.
\thn? :\fter the cabinet has held
a meeting and decided what it is to
do. The Kim.r must then do what
the cabinet insists on doing:

This democracy was not bor—

jrnwcd by the United States. It
‘ was as much American as Tlrilish.
‘it was theirs in the colonies. and

 

was what' they insisted on havin
as their birthrieht. -

Ancient democracy was crushed.
not because it failed to govern well.
but because it' was destroyed by a
(treat military power, Macedonia.
Modern democracy faces the same
situation to-day.

Dr. llart spoke at: the invitation
of Dr. A. R. llrnbacher. president
of the college. and of Dean Harlan
ll. Horm-r, president of the asso—
cialion.

“We have been saturated in

we were in the midst of it," said
lir. Ilartt " ‘ilism by some
l'oens lifll‘llS ha. unc to mean the
opposite of patriotism. and rightly
so, allhonu’h peace is [the thngr
which is nearest our hearts, if it
be a righteous peace. The ob-

to certain well-defined heads which
are the most serious issues of the
war.

 

    

 

 

 

   

Germans Feared Slavs.

"The crux of the situation cen-
ters in the disposition of indepen-
dt-ueics and powers which will re-
suit in the settlement of peace
terms. The 3o,ooo,ooo slavs of
('rnlral Europe must have a voice.
in the government, other nations
which have come to he looked
upon as dependencies in the inter-
national plan of things must have
their rights as individuals and
must be given their independence.
The reason for the war was the
fear of Germany and Hungary that
the Slav tribes within their borders
\rnuld go beyond bounds. Ger-
many now is supportng small
dnebies and dependencies in every
spot she can semi one of her
llohenzollcrns to rule. with the ex-
press purpose of added power in
the event of peace. Here, again.
the United States must set the. ex-
ample by relinquishinz any riqhts
to government of smaller nations
which are within her immediate
territory and the islands and racial
governments which she nmv holds.

" The Germans went into a six
months war, not a three or four
vcars’ siege, They have learned a
few things which are. maven upon
their in: s: one that they cannot
seize the world without the world’s
obiecllnns, another that the can-
turn and destruction of the western
nrnvers is impossible, Now the
mainspriiu.r of any peace moves re-
solves about the question as to
whether Germany can find some
other political interest save that of
colonization

 

 

Germany Crushed on Seas

“The two points on which the
allied world is centering its atten-
tion is the maintenance of the
wcsfcrn front and the questions
which have recently arisen in the
far east. livery one seems to have
lost sight of the fact that one of
the greatest aims of the German
government, the increase of sea
power, the strengthening of com<
pierce, has been forever broken.
\\"e hat ‘orgnttcn the bulwark of
life Allies, t‘hc iirilish fleet, which
have swept every German Iner-
chanl marine, every battleship,
which bore a (ierinan ling, off the
seas of the entire world. if Ticl~
e'ium stood bctwecnr democracy
and ant‘ocracy in the first year of
lhe war, then England's fleet is
standing now between those same
two forms of government, tlp’hold-
int.r the one. and utterly puttine’ to
rout the other. liut one ‘uotable
victory‘ has come to the (icrman
tleel'. during the past three years—
anrl to celebrate that they scuttled
back to their snug harbors and
and have never been heard of since.

“l'eacc at the end of the war
is not the I aim of the Allies.
it must be pt ce for our children
and their children, enduring for—
ever. For this reason it can only
come in one manner, in the total
crushng of German power. it
must be a decisive peace which will
separate that possible hierarchy be—
tween Turk. (icrman, fiultrar and
Austrian. The war will not be
won by the protection of the wash
cm front. but it will be certain
victory when the Allies can reach
into the center of Europe and take
llulgari'zl by the throat.

“ Who is going to annex terri-
tory at the end of the war? Ger-
many's commerce is forever dead
unless the Allies choose to return
it to her. She always had plenty
of sea ports. but she wished to
hold naval ports from Scandinavia
to lndia, rather titan from Berlin
to lingdad. Are the Allies to an-
nex territory? There have been
hints of annexation in the 'secret
treaty' of Russia and France de-
mands the return of Alsace-Lor—
raine. lint annexation will not
help matters. The Allies have
every parcel of German territory
outside of Europe. and they need
no more to clinch the argument. '

“As to indemnities. what will he
the outcome? Germany has seen
that territory must indeed be cap-
tured before an indemnity can be
levied with any expectation of its.
payment. But can the Allies de-
mand indemniticsi‘ Ifthey can drive
Germany from Belgium and France
and can push them back into their
own country, they will have ac«
complished their ends. and indemni-
