EDITORIALS

EXCHANGES — AND
PRINCIPLE

A marked copy of the “ Campus,"
a sheet published at the University
of Rochester, has been received at
the publication ofﬁce. in a half
column article entitled “Influence
of Campus 011 Other College
Papers," the State College News
receives quite a “ rap " for model-
ling some short “cditorialcttes”
after some of, the same literary at-
tempt which occurred in a recent
issue of the “Campus.” We ac—
cept the rebuke gracefully, but we
'do resent the unsportsmanlike
spirit evidenced by the sarcasm of
the last paragraph of the article.
The News is not a “follower,” but
a contemporary—and we do have
proof readers! (Or was it faulty
grammar that mode that last para—
graph so incoherent?

PERSONALITY vs. BRAINS

Examinations exist now only in
our memories—wand on our re-
port‘ cards. Some of our Freshman
friends are gone (requiescant in
pace), but most of them are still
with us. It is to these that we
must give attention.

Shl the Freshman who man-
aged to get several A’s be praised
by faculty and students until her
head becomes enlarged to such a
size that it refuses to function?
No, certainly not! ,But shall we
ignore her so conscientiously that
she says, “What’s the use, any-
way? The people Who don’t know
anythingr get all the honor here?"
Dccidedly not. It is our duty to
give her the encouragement and
help which will make her grow into
broader intellectual life. '

Greater than the number of such
prodigies, however, is the number
of the mediocre. We surely have
a duty with regard to them. There
are so many of them who can, by
wise helphrise above that class.
Don’t you know Freshmen (yes,
and upper classmen, too) whose
personality is A, though their
scholarship is D? Many of these
D's are due not to idleness but to
ignorance of the correct way to
study. Do you. you upper class—
men with A scholarship as well as
A personality, feel that you are do-
ing your duty, when you shake your
head and say,'"lt surely is too
.bad?" The -ones, too, whose

 

scholarship is high but personality
low need your help.

This collcge doesn't aim to turn
out encyclopedias; but it can’t aim
to turn out butterﬂies. What is
college, if not a place for the blond-
ing of those two extremes, a place
for the rounding 0f angles and the
development of personality? The
faculty are tryingr to accomplish
this aim. but they can’t do it all.
Give :1 little of the lime which you
now spend in gossiping with your
friends to getting acquainted with
Freshmen. Find what they need
and how you can supply that need.

if you earnestly do this, you w1l

considerably lessen the college
problem of " Personality vs.
lirznns."

To the Editor of the State College
\ie vs:

There has been much adverse
criticism among College students
on the rstnblishmenl of the pro-
posed chapter of Kappa Nu fra-
ternity at State College.

The News of last week printed
four rules governing the procedure
in the establishment of a fraternity
or of :1 sorority. Two of these
rules may be applied to the present
occasion.

is there a distith social need for
the fraternity? No—thcre are al-
ready two fraternities in College.
The war has greatly depleted one
of them and a great part of the
men who are left makes 11p the
other. in the second place, there
is not :1 sufﬁcient number of pros-
pective members in State College
to warrant the establishment of a
Jewish fraternity.

in regard to the standing of the
fraternitv in other colleges, the at—
titude of the other colleges is sig-
nificant. Both the college and
student councils of some other in-
stitutions have refused to recognize
Kappa Nu. This refusal came
after repeated demands on the part
of members for formal recognition.

Therefore. it would hardly seem
that our President or Myskania
should admit a fraternity which is
not recognized by colleges whose
standing is equal to ours and one
for which there is no particular.
need.

STUDENT ASSEMBLY

Second Lecture on‘ Food Conserva-
tion Series.

011 Friday morning, March
fifteenth, Student Assembly was
given over to the second of the
food conscrvtion lectures given by
Professor Marion 5. Van Licw.
The subject of the day was food
substitutes.

In the course of her remarks
Miss Van Licw laid stress on the
fact that we must save fats, meats,
sugar, wheat, if we are to select
one rule for war economy, lot it
be “ Choose Wiscly.’ This neces-
sitatcs the knowledge of substitu-
tion, hasch on the composition of

these foods. We are asked to have.

one whcatless meal a day and two
whcatlcss days a week—Monday
and Wednesday. This means no
crackers, pastry, macaroni, break-
fast food made of wheat, or wheat
flour, for any purpose. Let us rc-
1ncmbcr the foods the soldiers
need, and use for ourselves. the
foods we have in abundance. Fol-
lowing this :1. list of food values of
various crnnmndilics was given,
with a list of substitutes. One
barrel of flour will bake about
four thousand one hundred and
seventy—nine slices of bread. The
students in this institution number
over eight hundred. if each of us
saved a slice of bread a day, we
would altogether save sixty bar-
rels of flour a year. We are
asked to have one meatless day a
week—'l'ucsday. This means no
rattle, hog or sheep products.
011 other days use mutton and
lamb instead of beef or pork.
in addition there are two porlr~
less days in observc~'i‘ucsday
and Saturday. This means no
pork, bacon, ham, lard or pork
products.

To the Editor:

A few lines to say that we have
been doing nothing heroic.

This is a rapidly, developing ad-
vanced ﬂying camp, where we are
staying until our day comes. Then
we go to an elementary school at
first. This i believe is the third
llll)\'C, illlfi one more COIlICS IlftCl‘
this before the front.

The winter here is somewhat
milder than in New York State,
but not much.

_ There is about four inches
of snow and good roads for sleigh—
ing, but no sleds—nothing but the
cumbrnus two-wheeled carts, a'fcw
autos, and our own army autos and
trucks.

Talking of sport. our Cadet Com-
pany ran off with the football
championship of this camp, and
now we have but one more game
ahead, which, if they win, will mcan
the basketball championship. An
believe me. that is no small thing,
for we've an unusual number of
" big league " athletes at this camp.
if we are here much longer, we are
going after the baseball lbanner
too. I know there are at least two
"big league” ball players in our
outﬁt. and think there are more,
besides crack college men.

Every day there are several air—
planes in the air at each held
(several ﬁelds at this centre). We'd
be lonesome without the constant
rising and falling drone of those
engines above us. Fancy tricks,
you’d break your neck to see the
performance in the air, as part of
the regular training.

Hoping that my companions
have not forgotten me,

rcmain sincerely, ‘
Cadet Edward Potter,
3rd Aviation Instruc-
tion Centre, A. E. F.
Written to L. V. B.

BASKETBALL REVIEW
1917-1918

When we compare the basket-
ball tcnm that ﬁnished the season,
with that with which we began, we
certainly should appreciate the
wonderful team that was de-
vclopcd. ./\llho the team did not
win many games, we could see a
decisive improvement as the
season progressed. Coach Murouy
certainlyxlcscrvcs a lot of credit
for the development shown by the
lCillll.
