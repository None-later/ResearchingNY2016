The Rubaiyat of a Student
I sometimes think that never felt
so sure, my‘throat,
As when S. Assent-hiy’s o'er;
From each direction, like a spear-
‘point came
:\ rasping cough, which made my
throat so raw.
And some there were. the brightest
and the best

of zest,
And tried to hear thelspcnker'S
message therc-
But only heard the coughing of
the rest.

I sent my ears through the ether,
between
The rougher and me and then
and there it did seem
That every single cough was hut a

a (e, ‘
:\ slacker's tribute. not a patriot's
esteem,

You may have no money, hut I
know someone who's I-Iadcrup.

Did ever a Mann llaight to take

Cookery advice: If you would
eat the (‘orr of a llaldwin or Bart-
lctt,~Stewart.

 

II the miserly spinster kisses the
Indian on every penny, what does
Mildred Ilotchkiss?

Would one have to Force a Ford
Moore or less if there were a
Russel of Skirts hehind the wheel,
if the tank were I’uller gas, and if
there were no Knox in her car-
buretor? I'll Wager she Wood
llunt up some excuse to balk.

Is Mildred I-Iaswell?

She's a Kerr in most of. her deal-
ings, but the nice part of it is, she’s
always " Glad."
