ProfessOr Risley’s Lecture

A Study in Comparative Government

The third in the series of democ-
racy lectures was given by Profes-
sor lx’islcy, Friday. Those who
looked forward to'his usual orig—
inality and enthusiasm were not dis-
appointed. Speaking in the patriotic
and vibrant; mood he always has,
Professor Risley said mtiny things
we will "long remember."

"A study of comparative govern-
ment, that is the eovei-niiieirts 'of
other countries, has its place in a
survey of. deiuocr v inasmuch as
it becomes ticee 'y to test the
sincerity of governments lighting for
democracy principles by Seeing
whether or not their structure of
government is democratic.

 

“Such a government as Russia has
cannot be dignilit-d as a (itllllUClnLy,
despite the fact that it represents the
will of the people, We hailed the
Russian revolution as the beginning:
of democracy there. To our short-

 

sighteduess, autoeracy’s end meant
nothing more than the dawnede-
iiiocracy. From that time we date our
slogan of making the ‘world safe for
democracy.‘ .

“After the. revolution of March 17,
1918, the l)uina continued in power
under Lvol’f and Milukoli‘, This

PROF. DOUGLAS
GIVES LECTURE

Talks on “ Industrial Education
Convention ” to Industrial
tudents

Tuesday. the 19rh, Prof. Douglas
gave a lecture on the eleventh annual
convention of the National Society
for the Promotion of Industrial Edu-
cation. The convention, which re—
mained in senion (hiring Feb. ill-23,
brought to Philadelphia :1 number of
the most distinguished vocational
training experts in the country.

Dr. C. A. Presser, director of the
Federal Board of Vocational Educa-
tion, was one of _ the principal
speakers at the opening session. In
his address Dr. Prosscr characterized
as “foolish” that part of the draft
law which already has taken into the
army hundreds of young instructors
whose services are essential. for agri-
cultural and industrial work.

Several speakers agreed that the
operation of the S-mit‘h-I-Iiighes law
would mark the opening of a new
era in the educational history of the
United States. Already, they dc-
clared, there are indications that
after the war the trend toward
federal control will he a dominating
feature in all educational activity.

The need for highly specialized
workan for the war was empha-
sized by Dr. Arthur L. Williston,
director of the. Wentworth institute,
Boston. Dr. Willistoa predicted that
before the war ends 7,000,000 such
men would have to he sent to France.
and that ﬁlling their places would
require the training of additional mil—
lions here.

E, E, McNary, a U. S. Shipping
Board expert on industrial training,
told how the navy trains men to
become specialists in ship work.

Much of the time of the conven-
tion was devoted to a discussion of
war emergency training, the need of.
which Prof. Douglas summarized in
his lecture. r

potting,r a two-point lead on free

line. This was as near as the Juniors
came to winningr the game. Merchant
was the lirst man to score a licld
basket, dropping: our in from under-
neath the basket, The Sophs gradu-
ally drew away from their opponents,
which was the result of their superior
team work and Merchant's shooting.

basket in this half, Caslallano scoring;r
but three times from the foul line.
When the whistle sounded for half
time the score was Sophs 10, Jun<
iors 3.

in the closing period the Sophs
showed a flash of the form that gave
them the Championship last year. The
team passed the ball in great style
and the Juniors found it hard work
to get past Captain :Lobdell and
llakcs, stellar guards of. the Yellow
and White. Carson, Merchant and
Spi‘ingniami were the scorers for thc
Sophs, while Masson accounted for
nine points for the losers.

The Junior team went to pieces

CHAMPIONSHIP

The determining game of the series
was played Thursday when the Sophs
and Seniors met in the most hotly
contested game of the season. ’Dot
Austin made the ﬁrst score. Then
the Sophs sailed in and gained a
folir‘point lead for the ﬁrst half.
The score was 9 to .

In the second half the battle was
renewed. The eniors could not
break through the Sopli passwork.
Dot Austin was well guarded and
failed to score in the entire half.
Florence Bohnc did excellent work
for the Sophs and made all but .one
of the points for her team. Beulah
Cunningham as guard and Mad. Cmn~
mines as side center did much to gain
the Soph victory.

The ﬁnal score was 13 to 6. This

the Sophs have won ﬁve out of the
six games and their nearest competi-
(ms, the Seniors, have already lost
two. Miss Gray was referee.
