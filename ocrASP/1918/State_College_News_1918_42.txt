To the Editor:

Since the Kappa Delta Rho Frater—
nity is the largest purely men’s or—
ganization in the college, we itlt‘llllltll
we should state brielly our position
on the admission of a new fraternity.
We believe:

First. That a fraternity based on
sound principles and properly con-
ducted is a means of moral and sacral
betterment 10' its members and the
college as a whole. ,1 w . '

Second. aﬁﬂhzit‘hhe'rnlcs governing
the admission of fraternities to State
College, just published, are very com-
plete and fill a long felt need.

Third. That the acceptance or re-
jection of. a fraternity by some other
college is in itself no cause for like
action here. We should be governed
by the President’s findings and our
local needs. '

Fourth. Sine'eK. "D. R. has found
that even ‘in our l'r-st colleges
lodges not greatly exceeding thirly
active members are most efﬁcient, and
since there are many men in college
who do not care to pledge themselves
to conform to the principles on which
our fraternitypis founded, we feel
that if they have a desire to organize
along lines in» which they have a com-
munity of interest. we cannot and
should not deny them the privilege
which we demaan for ourselves.

To the Editortofthc “Neivs”:

',r.lt| lir’the last issue' of the paper there

appeared a letter which called atten<
tion to the fact that there was no
social need for the establishment of
a chapter of Kappa Nu fraternity at
State College. The validity of this
contention is to be tested by an ex-
amination of what conditions a social
need. It seems that the need would
spring from the desire of those who
seek a closer fraternal relationship.
A social need cannot be determined
by any other criterion. Do we want
ourselves organized? Our desire is
always, when this questidn is‘put, to
be satisﬁed from our own point of
view. . .
As to the new fraternin being
turned out at all colleges, this is dis-
proved by the fact that it is taken in
in Harvard, Johns Hopkins, Colum-
bia. Pennsylvania and New York

U. Why the Jewish young men who
seem to he excluded from college fra—
ternai life cannot have their own fra-
ternity is, a question which Seems
hardly debatable.

Resolution Adopted by Ath-
letic Council and by Mys-
kania

Since the students of State College
who have gone to war have thought
it unwise to ask for rebate of student
tax, it is the opinion of the Athletic
Council and of Myskania that it
would be unwise for students who
leave college for other reasons to ask
for a rebate.

FORMER STATE cor.—
LEGE STUDENT SUR-
vxves TUSCANIA

Robert McCarthy, a former student

of the college, is one of the survivors
of the Tnscania. A letter received
fronrhis mother describes his experi-
ence: .
"Robert had a very narrow escape,
as he was among the last to leave
the boat, and in helping some of the
others to tie the ropes he was pushed
overboard. He struck against an
overturned life boat, which dazed
him. but in the water he became con—
scious and was ﬁnally rescued by a
rope thrown from one of the de—
stroyers. He landed the next morn—
ing, and since then he has been all
over the llritish Isles. lie is new a
draftsman in an aviation camp in
Scotland."

Dear Prof. Douglas:

No, i haven’t fallen from a plane,
been shot by a spy nor anything like
that. but i have been so darn busy l
have hardly had time to draw my pay.

I have had lots of experiences since
i left the old S. C. T; When i said
goodbye to old Albany the govern—
ment gave me a ﬁne Pullman ride to
Pensacola. Everything was ﬁne anti
1 had the time of my life. When 1
reached there i found it much over-
crowded. They had no equipment for
us and no place to swing a hammock.
My bed was on the floor under a
table, but as the room was a school-
room I was perfectly at home. After
ﬁve days of nothing to do but sit
around and grow fat, 1 was trans—
ferred to Hampton Roads. For a
while we had it kind of tough here.
sleeping on ﬂoors, no warm water,

 

but we managed to make a joke of it

 

and pulled through. Aftcr‘the first
week conditions improved. and every-
thing went along well. e had a
great bunch of men and a dull mo-
ment was seldom experienced. This
is some life. it’s fall in, fall out and
stand by. We hit lllc deck at 5:30
A. M. and lights are out at 9 P. M.,
when we are supposed to pipe down.

While l was studying for the quar-
tcrtnastcr exam I was also busy pre-
paring for an exam for entrance to
the Ensign School here. By rare good
luck T was successfuh Yesterday I
moved my bag and hammock to this
school and tomorrow i start work.
Tell the boys to study math, if they
want to get anywhere in the army or
navy. Had i never studied trig. I
would never have made the school. i
also found that mechanics was a great
help in the aviation school. Make the
boys work hard, for they will appre-
ciate the value of it when they get
out. Wish i had had more of the
stuff.

The life here has certainly agreed
with me. i have already gained about
fourteen pounds. We get line chow
and a hammock is not at all bad to
sleep in after you learn how. The
chief requirement is to lay fast. for
the deck is six feet below and quite
hard. All our clothes are kept in a
sea hag. A more unhandy thing
would be hard to find, for the article
you want is always at the bottom.

l have had quite a lot of guard
duty since i have been ilL'l'C. You
start out with a gun and come back
with a cannon.

Yours sincerely,
Ralph W. Floody.

JUNIORS WIN

FROM FROSH

The Frosh played their last and
best game Wednesday, losing to their
sister team by a score of 18 to 13.
The first half was well fought by
both sides and the result of the game
was still doubtful when, at the end
of the ﬁrst half, the score was 6 to 6.
in the second half the Juniors
brought in swiltcr pass work and
stronger guarding against the Fresh

away from their opponents and won
by a safe margin.
