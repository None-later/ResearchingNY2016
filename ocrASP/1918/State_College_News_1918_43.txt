NEWMAN

This is that interesting, all-import-
ant information The Newman song
contest is on, but the time is drawing
to a close. The prize is twenty
dollars, and you need not write both
words and music. lf‘you write music
but simply can’t write words, why not
collaborate with some of the more
poetically inclined members? We
have lots of talent, and at least there
is nothing lost by trying, and you
stand an excellent chance of ﬁnding
there's lots to gain. If you wish any
further iufonnatinn, ask any member
of the council or the committee,
Margaret Miller, Aileen Russell and

illiam Merchant.

The Newman dance is April 13th.
Don’t forget!
