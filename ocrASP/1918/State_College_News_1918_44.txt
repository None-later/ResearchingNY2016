So be it. Away with plirascand sub:

"it is not unfair to assert that at

“ Our positive distaste for the fund-

the mood of the German. Surely, a
government of its known autocratic

sort, even though it represents the *

stretch of the imagination, be termed
a democracy. Hence, the deﬁnition

“ What is a real deﬁnition of de-

it and has always put it into open—

government which allows a minority
to become a majority. The working
of this practical deﬁnition will pro-

duce and ﬁt democracies that suit our .

notion of the will of the people. A
democracy allows the 'outs’ to bc—

to grow and to be tested. It produces
change that is gradual. It is that
form of government which allows
