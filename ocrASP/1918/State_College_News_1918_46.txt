Professor Walker's inspiring lec—
tnrc last Friday brought home to
us aeain the fundamental beauties
of the system we fight to preserve.
After comparinpr the movement
of democracy to that of Christian-
ity 1,900 years ago, the speaker
went on to prove that democracy
really isspreading.

“ The movement toward denim
cracy is world \vide andtidal. it
has gone on for a century and a
quarter, and has invaded every

literature or baseball players.
