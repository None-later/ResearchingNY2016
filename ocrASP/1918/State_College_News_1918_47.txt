NOT ONLY — DO YOUR
BIT; BUT — DO YOUR
BEST

, The Third Liberty Loan is here.
It is for us who remain iiere to
make this drive successful—our
armies in France are just beginning
.to make themselves felt. What can
we'do to help them? Several hun-
dred of, our own boys have died
doing honor to our flag.
many more lives are to be lost, de-
pends on how each one of as does
is share—give and after you have
given all you have. find-and give
some‘more. America has only be-
gun. v Our devotion, our endurance,
has in no proportion been tested.
hen we are called upon to give
up necessities of food and shelter,
when those we love are dead in
France instead of asleep in Spartan-
burg, when we, the ones at home,
have nothing left but life, then*we
can say that the War has asked us
much. ut now when our only
“sacriﬁces” have been gains and
not sacrifices, we must not regret
lending the money our nation
as enabled us to make, to the
preservation of that nation and the
young men who love her banner.
he German morale will be
strengthened if they find one soli-
tary thing for hope. In the past
three years and a half, they have
had_but very few real successes.
Their history has been a history of
repeated failures—~21" their trump
cards have proved to be smaller
than those in the hands of our
no'lli‘Le al’llies. , .
e t ird liberty loan is a t to
be hurt by the. fact that manyphave
and'a're spending for thrift and war
savings stamps what they would
otherwtse have spent on a bond.
.et us not shirk. Our all is; at
stake—life. honor, love.

What is the pleasure in a new
suit compared to the thrill we get
when, the boys on the" corner cry
out about German loss and repulse?

n Dr. Finlcy’s hook- on. " French
Schools in War Time," he quotes a
youngFrench teacher as saying
she preferred to put a gun in the
handsof a soldier rather than buy
a new dress. The large sums will
have to be given by the wealthy——
let ,us give even in small amounts
fol-they total to a large sum.

‘Oh, say, will you see in the future
years, the American flag still flying,r
so'fondl over our still careless
heads? ' row can we doenough for
’our country? What sacrifice is
‘grcat enough to be sufﬁcient?

TO THE STUDENT BODY

The News is anxious to publish
the views of the students of the col-
lege concerning the war, and our
part in the sacriﬁces necessary for
its successful completion. You
have heard the various suggestions
offered in student assembly last
Friday morning, and you have
heard rumors that all college social
functions may be given up. These
suggestions have had some sort of
reaction in your minds, singly and
collectively; Will you not give us
your viewpoint? if you feel that
we should give up all our social life
will you not present your argu-
ments, and if you fch that this
course would be an unwise one, will
‘you not defend this View? We
hope to publish a series of letters
from students, deﬁnitely showing
the general feeling at State College,
Will you not send us one such let-
ter? Make it short and to the
point. The name of the writer must
be known to the board, but will not
be published unless so desired.
Let us hear from you before next
Monday morning.

HOW DOYOU
FEEL ABOUT IT?

i didn’t do any Red Cross work
last week. i didn't have time.
Monday afternoon during the scw~
ing hours i attended phychology
and draniatics classes. 1The inter-
vening period l devoted to reading
some plays required for dramatics
class. Monday evening when the
sewing rooms were open. l studied
biology, collected notes for a
thesis, and translated German, un-
til 12 p, in. i couldn’t help with
surgical dressings Tuesday after-
noon, either. There was an inn
portant meeting of a dance commit~
tee; then another play to read for
draniatlcs; and after i had studied
college algebra awhile, there were
only a few minutes before English
i6. After that classyi had to go
home and study for a mathematics

test to be given on \iVCflllCS(lily,'

That is an cxainplc‘ of how my
hours were filled every day.

My work for the week had to
be .vcry methodically scheduled;
there was so much of it,——1nd it
was so very important. On my
written plan the words appearing
most often were “ dance commit-
tee," “phychology,” “college alge-
bra," and “dramatics.” " Liberty
loan " was there in one place. i
think it accounted for about one-
half hour.

l have made a new schedule for
this week. At the top of the
I have written a'quotation rent
one of the professors of the col-
lege, ‘.‘ [u the interests of the suc-
cessful outcome of this war, and of
efﬁciency in civilization after this
war. the schools of the United
States must be interfered with radi-
cally, and in vehement seriousness;
This interference should begin with
the colleges." '

in the new schedule, "Red Cross
Work,”, and “canvass for the
Liberty Loan” are writteujii sev-
eral of the little square divisions.
A large number of the hours are
given to research work on “The
Control and Assignment of Labor
During the air." There were
some things on last week’s schedule
that do not appear on this week's.
Perhaps it would not be wise to
name them.

At thr- end I have copied the fol-
lowing personal comment from
my English ll notebook: "i wish
i was not burdened with mechani-
cal college work and unimportant
tasks. so that i might have time to
think, to study the history of to-
rlav. and to help my country, right

SENIOR VICTORY

The final game of the girls’ series
was played last week when the
Seniors in old style defeated their
opponents by a high score. D. Austin
made the first basket. in quick suc-
cession she piled up others until at
half time the score stood l() to (i.
The second half went better for the
,ltmiors, but they suffered a last (le-
fcat to the former champions. The
score was 29 to 18. Miss Gray was
referee. -

Much can be said in praise of the
Senior team During the four years
in college this team has won the
championship once and approached
it all other years. "his year the
Seniors have had too many difﬁcul-
ties to stand up to form—noon
classes, teaching. and barrier work
have kept them from practice. They
have lost two games, both to the
Sophomores. it is noteworthy that
the same personnel have constituted
the team from the beginning. Last
year. Mildred l-lull, a valuable new

player, appeared, and the team was‘

weakercd when she failed to return.
