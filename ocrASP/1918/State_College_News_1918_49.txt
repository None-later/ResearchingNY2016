is' possible~peaee by surrender,
.audpcace by Victory. The former

takes money. A small way in
which we might serve would be to
'curb .soeial affairs in the College.‘

Professor Decker then an,-
rnonn‘eed that the Junior Class of

‘ I [919 had already signiﬁed its ‘llltcll‘

tion to purchase a liond, and was
the first to get in line.

A challenge by Dean Homer to
the whole 'student body followed.
He expressed his appreciation of
what the College had already done
in the previous campaigns. but said
that we must awaken much more
and respond accordingly to the
present' need. The holiness oi'
'iiiight is now arraigned against the
holiness of right on the Western
llront. The right must win there
or else'some day on our own soil.
When we ask ourselves how much
we have sull‘ered personally, the
answer is revealingr We find we
have not gone hungry. nor without
what we deem necessaries. Hence
there is no ream-iii why any institu-
tion or organization cannot ﬁnd
means to buy at least one bond.
We must do not only our hit, not
only our duty. but all that is in us
to (lo-in every way.

The session closed with the sing-
ing of the National Anthem.
