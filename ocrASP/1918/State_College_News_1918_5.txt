STATE COLLEGE NE

Dr. Finley Brings Report
Continued from Page 

President Roosevelt. He brought
back messages from almost all the
universities of France. These
hutcr wcrc beautifully decorated.
l)r. Finley read a translation of one
of the most eloquent of these. It
was written by a young girl but it
will be read and landed all over
this country. She describes a
narrow stream, with a great army
on either side of it, but the
distance between these armies was
great for it was all the distance
which exists between right and
wrong. Then she describes the
great ocean. but the distance from
shore to short: is very little because
its people are united at heart——
America and Francel

CHEMISTRY CLUB

.\ meeting of Chemistry Club
was held at 3:45 Friday afternoon,
January 4th. At this time Miss
Duly, 1hr.- prcsidcut, spoke to the
club on the subject of water. The
thrco most important things of life
are air, food and water. Water is
of the greatest importance, both
chemically and physically. Miss
Daly spoke of the main sources of
water for drinking purposes and
explained the necessity of its being.'
pnrc. l‘urc water is necessary
because it doesn’t remain in the
stomach long enough to be pttri<
lied. Many diseases are caused by
drinking impure water. in 1800
there was an epidemic of typhoid
fever in the cities along the Hud-
son River below the Mohawk. This
led to the present system of mu—
nicipal puriﬁcation. ()ur drinkng
water is most commonly purilicrl
by methods of ﬁltration. The slow
sand ﬁlter is of English origin,
while the rapid mechanical ﬁlter is
an American invention.
