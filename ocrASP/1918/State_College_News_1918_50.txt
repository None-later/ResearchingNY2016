“Although our wounds may bleed,
Although our voices break, ,
Louder than the storm, lou‘der
' than the guns,
Sing of the pride of our defeats
’Neath this bright autumn sun,
And sing of the joy of honor
When cowardice might be sweet.
To the 'sound of the bugle, the
sound of’ the drum,
On the ruins of Aersehot; of
Dinant and Termondc.

“Dance, Belgians, dance, '

And our glory sing.
Although our eyes' may burn,
Although our brain may turn '
Join in the ring!

Pres. IBrubacher Makes Sixth Address ‘

of Democracy Series .‘ .

 

“Education in :1 Democracy”

subject of lecture Commemo-

rating Patriot‘s Day.

The sixth lecture of the series
on Democracy, being given at the
college by the faculty. was given
by l‘resideut A. R. Bruhacher last
l‘riday afternoon. The subject
was “Education in a Democracy,”
The speaker took a few moments
at the beginning of the hour to
discuss the relation of l’atriots
Day to the development of de-
mocracy in America. On April
l‘Jth, one hundred forty-three years
ago, a few Massachusetts farmers
insisted on their individual liberty
to the extent of 0])cnly'ilgll‘iltig
the llritisli army in the village of
Lexington. 'l‘hev thereby demon-
strated that the government in the
United States must rest in the con-
sent of the governed, This act
was a demonstration of unity made
significant, in the Declaration of
Independence on Jilly 4th of the
following year, and laid the foun-
dation for a denmcratic form of
government in the United States.

Early in the lecture, Dr. Bru—
harher defined three phases of
democracy and later showed that
each phi c has a special signifi-
cance for education. He said:
"ft is first a philosophy of‘life;
then it is a form of government
established solely for the purpose
of giving full force and expression
to that democracy: and finally it
is a distinctive social conscious-
ucss by which a people knows that
the government to which it con—
sents gives concrete expression to
that people's philosophy. i go to
our own Jefferson for a definition
of that philosophy: "l‘hut all men
are created equal, that they are
endowed by their creator with cer-
tain inalienable rights; that among
these are life. liberty, and the pur—
suit of happiness.’ I'go tO'the
prophet and high priest of demoe—
racy. the martyred Lincoln. for the
formula of governmeutr. ‘Goveru—
meat of the people, by the people,
and for the people.’ and T go to an
Ameri'an poet and patriot. James
Russel Lowell, for the social credo:
‘Every man has a chance and
knows that be has it."’

"After the philosophy of free~
rlom and inalienable rights finds
formal expression in a government
‘of the people, for' the people'and
by the people’ established to se-
cure the rights of this philosophy.
it follows inevitably that such gov-
ernment cannot endure, unless the
mass of the people is conﬁdent its
rights are secure," continued the
speaker. “The social conscious-
ness that each has a chance is the

 
 

real test of (lettiocracv. The con-'

dition of social Justice must be
insured by a government if it is
to be an enduring formula. As a
more philosophy. democracy may
endure even in- the minds of sorelv
oppressed people under autocratic
Hovermneuts. \Vitness the Rus~
sinn and even German democratic
erniins. s a government it can
endure only as it justiﬁes itself to
the peonfe and becomes a means
of social _satisfactinn throughout
the populace,”

 

The speaker next made note .of
the fact that wherever men extst
in groups there naturally springs
up some form of unity in govern-
ment. He spoke of examples in
half. civilized clans and tribes,
where some definite ritual and
ceremonial observances are com-
mon, Denioc’raey' bas'dcv'cloped
certain :ritualsvand Observances on
which it sidisists.

The Business of} Education to Pre-
pare Youth for Democracy

Dr. ltruhiwhcr, proceeding to-
ward the object of the lecture,
said: "It is the business of educa-
tion to prepare the youth for clan-
life, to understand its peculiar sig-
iiili‘ance, to learn loyal service to
its requirements. Education is,
therefore, charged with the specific
duty to induct the young. into the
ranks of citizens by giving them
a complete knowledge of all the
ideals, institutions, and observ-
anccs for which democracy stands.
Adjusting to the clan—life of de-
inocraey is the chief business of
education, determining the con-
tents of its program, aud‘its
methods of procedure. Democracy
differs frontother forms of govern-
ment in the demands it makes
anon individuals. 'It gives him
rights and demands from him
heavy duties and responsibilities.
For example, it gives him liberty
and expects from him voluntary
service and observance of law and
order. Education ill a democracy
must, therefore, adiust the indi-
vidual to these peculiar conditions.
How may this be done?

“Public health is paramount.
Every citizen is a part of the state,
a potential ruler, a protective
agent. That he may be useful to
himself, an efficient EOClal.,tlltit.
self~respecling, fit to do his,part,
he must know how to conserve his
health, which is his capital in
stock and trade, Accordingly, ed-
ucation must acquaint him With
the laws of hygiene, in order that
he may come to his task of citizen-
ship and community responsibility
with a sound body. The most
democratic tendency in education
is compulsorv health service in the
public schools." The speaker fur-
ther pointed out that education
must discover all' the talents and
capac es wliidh make the i‘udivid»
ital what he is. ,lt must reveal
men and women to themselvts.
and enable them to givetheir own
particular powersat their best, to

their environment. I

   

After dw‘elling'apon the train-
ing of 'thc' individual at some
length. the speaker emphasized the ‘
necessity for the trainingr of so-
ciety as a who e, The natural
method in this field is civics. it is
the science of community service.
in conclusion, he said: “Educa—.
‘tion needs but to look-about itself
'for a profusion of means to teach
cooperatibu and responsiveness in

'n

the social unit. -
