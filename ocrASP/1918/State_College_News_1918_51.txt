a few minutes each day in reading
a newspaper if one were available.

As «far as I am able to ascci-
tain at present I do not know of
a normal school in the State
which does not furnish at least
one paper for the use of the stu-
dents. ()iic of these schools rc-
ceives three N. Y. newspapers, the
Times, the Tribune. and the Sun,
which are placed d“ the school
reading room as soon as received,
not the day aficr.

If some alicutinn were given to
this matter at State College the
students, l am sure, would be most
grateful. ' i

says..“1\ll work and no play make

singularly applicable lit-re, With
social functions removed college
will mean nothing to students but
drudgery—and that will kill the
college spirit we are striving so

To the Editor of the News:

in the last issue of the. News
you asked the views of individuals
in him student body concerning' our
social life here as affected by the
war. lylv opinion is that it would
he decidedly unwise to stop the
dances all together. The colleen
people. beingr human. need some
recreation. it is denied them in
one place. they often seek it in
one more olijectionahle. Of

 

 

 

course i am' not defending expen-
sive dances, or even as expensive
ones as they had here in the last
few years; At the Senior Hop and
the Suph Soiree the only expense
was the music; in neither, eiise did
that exceed twenty dollars. Those
present had ii fine time.

i admire the patriotic spirit
which induces a fraternity or u
sorority to give up a dance, btit
what if the individuals of that so-
ciety then plan to attend a more
expensive dauee outside of col-
lege instead? Why not have al
least one big dance a year which
any N. ‘ '. '1‘. student niie'bt
atend and invite an outside guest?
Let the expense of this dance be
fairly heavy. say about: three dol-
lars, aiiil the proceeds given to the
lied Cross or some patriotic work.

Surely there would be enough
students glad to attend such a
dance.

Another suggestion—if the p;an
were open for informal dances on
liriday evenings just for college
people and a nominal snin were
charged for admission, the pro-
cccds to be ‘v'ded between music
and lied . perhaps there
would be less If satisfaction about
the quality and quantity of our

dances.

'l‘o the Editor:

I say, why have college rings
at all? Of course. i realize that
they mean ii Went deal to most of
iis—wc would he very proud Ul
them when we are alumni. vlltit a
golden cii'clcl about the llllRL‘l’ will
not mean anything for our country
and “our boys" wbilc, six golden
dollars would put a halo around
the head of anyone who sacriliccil
them for a Liberty l’ioiid or Thrift
Stamp.

in the ﬁrst place we don’t need
these rings and most of us are
agreed that luxuries should he
“cut out” till we “win the war."
lll ancicnl times a seal ring,r was
used in sealing docuiiicuis. bui
now we have not even that excuse.
Secondly. many people will never
wear their rings after they leave
college and they will be mislnid
and lost and thus be worthless.

Again. probably we wouldn't eivc.

six dollars toward a Libertv Bond
if we didn‘t buy a ring, but isn't
that evidence of our selfishness?
lillilllv. what a spirit is ours when
we will lcl “our boys" sacrifice
all—their courses which we have
the peaceful opportunity to con-
tinue. their friends. their homes.
their very lives. and we pay six

dollars for a bit of gold for
vanity's sake? Can’t you hear
them calline across the waters?
