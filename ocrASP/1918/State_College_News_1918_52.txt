varies greatly With the seasons. As
the . season advances and the
weather conditions become more
settled we lilltl iiioi‘c regularity in
the bird movements.

Birds mostly migrate by night
for the protection that the dark-
ucss affords. Usually tiicy travel
in flocks and on dark nights, lly so
low that their calls as they main-
tain their groups may be plainly
heard.

Thch Prof, Bronson gave
statistics Concerning the length of
trips taken by different species of
birds and explained their routes.
lie also emphasized the unestimu-
his value of birds to immunity,
giving definite data to prove his
statements. The lowest estimate
concerning the savinp,‘ of birds to
agricultural interests is $l,250.000.
For economical rcasons as well as
scutimculul ones, our birds should
receive protection.

I’l‘hc lecture was supplmnentcd
by lantern slides of colored birds.
