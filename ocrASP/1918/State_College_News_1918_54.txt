LAND ARMY CALLS
FOR VOLUNTEERS

State College to Furnish Unit

Miss Stevens, a Senior from
Barnard College, addressed the
student body last Friday morning,
in behalf of the Woman’s Land
Army of America. Site described
the sort of girls needed, and the
kinds of work they will have to do,
by relating some of her own in-

teresting experiences on farms,
last summer.

The Land Army needs forty
thousand farmerettes. It also
needs girls who can cook and
girls who can run cars. College

people are especially in demand
because of the fact that college
spirit cr‘ates enthusiasm where-
evcr it goes.

A “unit” consists of a group of
girls living together under the
supervision of a House Mother.
They are hired out daily to the
farmers in the vicinity am] are
carried back and forth in liords,
every morning and evening. Each
farmerette receives fifteen dollars
a month besides living,r expenses.

Miss Stevens explained that
while the girls might get very
tired at first because of the hard
work, they would soon obtain ad-
ded strength and joy in their
labors. ller unit, last summer
bad to clean up the house and
other buildings in which they were
to be quartered. The corn crib
made a very comfortable room for
four—except when it rained. The
girls knew little about agriculture
at first, but they soon learned that
vegetables generally grow in rows,
weeds grow anywhere, snakes are
valuable to farmers, cows must be
milked at regular intervals and
hens lay only one egg a day. They
hoed potatoes, cultivated, picked
fruit, cut and shocked corn, and
did all the work that a hired man
would do except mowin" and feed-
ing the silo. The girls in this
group called the Bedford Unit
also had quite a bit of unique ex-
citement over the fact that some
of their neighbors thought them
to be front the liedford Reforma-
tory.

Women can do farm work, and
have done it abroad for some time.
The question is whether the
American women will get busy
and make a success of it.

H. E. Department to Support
Movement

Miss Van Liew then assured
the students that She would stand
back of this work. She believes
that it is of particular interest to
H. E. girls in that they may help
the nation and gain valuable ex-
perience at the same time.

The girls interested were asked
to see Miss Stevens and Miss Van
Liew and discuss the proposition
of having a State College Unit.
Surely our College wll be as well
represented in this war activity as
it is in all others.

The News offers its congratula-
tions to the professors who have
received in the form of a slight in-
crease iu salary, state recognition
of their efforts. This has been
done by a recent act of the Legis-
lature.

Utopian Democracy

Professor Kirtlund, In Seventh Democracy Lecture,
Plea-es Large Audience

Professor Richmond H. Kirt-
land, head of the Eu lish Depart-
ment, presented file seventh
lecture of the Faculty series last
Friday afternoon in the audi-
torium. Always a favorite speaker
with the students and with the
Capitol District public, be was
greeted by a large and attentive
audience. In his usual forceful and
pleasing manner he discussed
Democracy as it is, as the Utopian

would have it, and brought out
clearly the lessons of the great
war.

in opening his speech, he said:
“We have little heart, now, for the
discussion of ideal democracy as a
thing remote; while the very exist—
ence of free institutions is in
hourly jeopardy; while the future
of liberty depends on the part
America plays by deed of hand,
not by word of month; while fel-
low-kindness is once more before
i’ilatc, and we must all prove or
deny discipleship, it seems an idle
thing to give hour upon hour to
there words. \Vc would hurry
from this place of discussion if we
knew where to make deeds out-
weigh speech.

"Yet we have faith that the
British line will hold; faith that
where Frenchmen stand, the Ger-
mans shall not pass; faith that to
the dauntless heroism of the
.b‘itou and the Gaul shall be
added, before it is too late, the
dominant note of a conquering
third. Only such faith can justify
our present academic use of time,
our attempt to look beyond war,
seeking to formulate a few of those
principles of change which events
are thrusting upon us.

"In this tranquil place, removed
from the strain of compulsory
choice between ways of life and
death, harsh judgments; are un~
becoming,—- notably in ~th  ace of
so great a national achievement of
solid results where all was to
learn, all to plan, all-"to be done.
The. criticism of America by Azmer-
icans must look constructively
forward. If we attempt to‘cauter-
ize our faults, it must be for pre-
vention and cure."

in consideration of war's inroads
upon democracy, the speaker con—
tinued: “War’s one lack, as we
have already known it, and as our
Allies have suffered through it for
more than three years, has been the
lack of concerted leadership and
concerted policy. Only under fierce
impact of a final German drive has
a commander-in-chief of Allied
armies been chosen. American
leaderships found itself compelled,

or thought itself compelled, to
wait more than two ‘neutral'
years while the popular will
hardened for war. Those two

years have cost civilization dear!
We are told that debates resembl—
ing those of happier times delayed
the choice of machine guns for
almost a year; it took nearly an
equal time to prove to our biased
judges that French 75's are the most
effective guns of their class in the

 

 

world; we have held that Amer-
ican motors must drive American
planes; for this, and certain other
reasons, we have as yet contributed
little to the air service, beyond a
vicious speeding of German con-
struction. The competitive, gov-
eminent-hampered system of rail-
road management, the individual-
istic control of food supplies,
through supply and demand, alike
broke down early.

“Our reactions from such costly
inefficiencies as these have brought
great changes, all in the direction
of unit control for unit purpose.
l.’lainly, when a democratic nation
approaches the climax of a gigantic
war, national democracy, at least.
becomes Utopian, a thing of
dreanis. it may be doubted
whether America has yet muddled
her way through to any clear con-
ception of the size of the job in
hand. We do not even know what
are the resources at hand; we have
no adequate industrial census; we
have permitted or required half a
million young farmers to enter the
army and navy, and have enticed
as many more away from the farm
by our ill-advised handling of
wages in factory work; we have
not attempted a reasoned distinc-
tion between and among the neces-
sities of peace, the comforts of
peace, the luxuries of peace, and
the requirements of successful
war.”

l.’r.ofessor Kirtland then took up
the discussion of the lessons of
war, by asking whether we are to
admit that democracy is unsafe;
that only the strong arm avails;
that equality is only a dream; that
the will of the people is a myth;
that society always has been and
always will be made up of leaders
and the led; and whether we shall
confess that the primal instinct for
war survives yet,—— that a healthy
young,r man loves war, even this
wan—even this war more than all
others. His summarizing query,
“shall we therefore say, back to
the good old days of each man for
himself, and the devil take the
hindmost, only let us keep a good
army and navy, and a better look-
out when the next war comes?"

With the statement “ Democracy
is unsafe in any nation which holds
aloof. seeking its own ends, and
giving only where it may expect
return with interest. That nation
is unsafe which remains unfore-
warned, incredulous, unprepared,"
the speaker proceeded to name
several of the lessons of this war.
Among these were listed (I) the
necessity of the unity of all peoples
for neutral defense and service;
(2) the need for general disarma-
ment; (3) the need for even terms
of trade and intercourse; (4) the
need for regulated, non-individual-
ized management; (5) the necessity
for economic system; '(6) that we
consider “ofﬁce” no longer simply
an honor, but a grave duty; (7) the
need to teach broadly effective
citizenship; and (8) the need of a
