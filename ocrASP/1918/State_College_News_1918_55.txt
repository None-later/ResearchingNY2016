STUDENT CO-OPERA-
TION NEEDED

How many of the student body
ever stop to think of the enormous
amount of work that has to be
done by the Faculty in order that
everything may run smoothly?
Very few, sad to say! Well, think
about it now—and keep thinking
about it 1hard for the next couple
of weeks. Read the official- notices
on the opposite page, and on the
bulletin board! Learn theml. Show
the Faculty your appreciatiomof
till their niitiring work, by carrying
out promptly all the instructions
received from headquarters.

 

WAR WORK AND FUN

“.l'm having too goodp time for
' said guiltin

war days," a girl
yesterday. And don't you have to
admit she‘s very nearly right?

Isn’t there something about the
good fellowship of Red Cross ser-
vice that brings college nearer and
leaves you with a warm sense that
you are working for the cause?
It raises your self—respect. You
grin across a tableful of gauze, and
exchange gossip for an hour, and
then Settle down to psych with a
positive thrill. There’s a satisfac~
tion in “ stamping out the Kaiser"
with the quarter we could have
spent on movies or car fare, and
most of us enjoy “tooting the ‘toot’
in substitute," for the war breads
are [unexpectedly delicious. And
we sometimes stop to wonder, as
we “ knit two, purl two," if we
aren’t really having the time of our
lives, instead of shouldering a
man's job.

To most of us the sufferings of
war are only rumors. We want to
feel the burden—to do something
vaguely big. And how we hate all
that talk about the, "only-stami-
and—waitcrs." We tramp streets
after the elusive Loan, and long to
tire ourselves out with endless
hours of weeding and freeing. We
worry over intricate bandages and
wish we were at the front applying
them.

For we're having such a wonder—
ful time getting together" and know-
ing people. that it doesn't seem as
if we could he doing so much that
we are really indispensable. But

can't get along without us. Let's

not feel guilty, then, but make the
most of the happiness that comes
from helping. Our turn is coming
for more conspicuous work.

ECHO ELECTIONS

Do you think it’s just that elec-
tions to "The Echo" board should
be by vote of the student body?
True, “The Echo” is for all of the
students, but do the rank and ﬁle
of readers know who can do the
best work, who have the most
literary ability? How many
students think of this when they
vote? "The Echo“ is our only
lilei'ary production, and election to
the board ought not to be by popu-
larity. social standing. class poli-
tics, sorority spirit, or any other
superficial consideration. Since
the only way of determining real
merit is by actual work, Why not
institute a system of “try-outs"
similar to that used by the "News"
last fall when new members were
chosen for the hoard? At that time
several people tried out for the
hoard and had the satisfaction of
feeling that the. probability of
appointment rested on their own
ﬁtness for the position. Our liter—
ary publication cannot in the
broadest sense be representative of
our college unless-it represents the
best talent and ability in the col—
lege. So why not election by trial
rather than by unrestricted vote?

To the Owners of Liberty Bonds:
Something has come to my
notice recently that I think should
be brought to the attention of all
those who have bought Liberty
Bonds—«specially the organiza-
tions. Everyone at some time
must ask himself just which one of
the various needs for money he
shall respond to. Most of us can—‘
not remand to all. Here is a
chance bv which money may be
elven to help win the war and to
feed those whom the war has made
destitute at the same time.

Give your Liberty Bonds to the
American Committee for Armenian
and Svrian Relief. These bonds
will then he used as security
against drafts drawn and used for
food in Western Asia. Think it
over, and then act!

' ‘  WOMEN INFLUENCE
. . LAW

 

 

 

There is one very important or«
ganization in this country whose
work seems to be little understdm
or appreciated by the world at
large—the Consumers’ League.
One part of its work is that in
which its influence is exerted to
"boost" laws which will benefit
labor conditions, and prevent the
passage of those which would be
decidedly non-beneficial.

Due undoubtedly to the fact
that women now have political
power, the Assembly, in its closing
hours, after a bitter light on the
part of the opposition. passed the
Nicoll Messenger Service Bill,
94-10. This bill, which had the
support of most of the prominent
women's organizations, including
the Consumers’ League, New York
State Woman Suffrage Party,
Council of VVonien’s Organiza-
tions, VVomen’s City lub,
Women‘s Municipal League and
the \Vonien’s Republican Club,
prohibits the employment of girls
under 21 years of age as messen-
gers: for women over 21 years of
age it limits employment to 6 days
a week, 9 hours a day and prohibits
their working between it) p. in. and

a. m. ,

The bill, although opposed by
the messenger service companies,
passed the Senate early in the
week. It came up for vote in the
Assembly late Friday night, and,
due to the lateness of the hour and
amidst much confusion. the opposi—
tion through Assemblyman Welsh
carried a motion to rccomiiiit the
bill. :\ motion immediately made
to reconsider the vote was lost and
the b'll was considered dead for
this ssion.

Not to be easily defeated, Miss
Jane l'iiiciis, Executive Secretary

 

 

  
  
 

 

of the Slate Cons‘umérs' League,
who was ending the ﬁght for the
bill, started action to gett e Com-
mittee on Rules discharged. On a
roll call such a motion was sus-
tained late on the closing day of
the session and the committee was
discharged by a vote of 79-23.
This is said to be the ﬁrst time
the Rules Committee has been dis-
charged since 1912. The women
won out on the ﬁnal roll call,

Upon being asked whether
women received more considera-
tion this year from the Legislature
than in preceding years, Miss Pin-
cus said: "There was a marked
'hangc in the treatment of women
this year at Albany. - Our Repre-
sentatives were much more ap-
proachable and we were able to
talk to them on a different plane.

"We found that they were eager
to know how women felt about
certain bills and wanted to know
of the action taken by women's
clubs. Despite the fact that there
was a recognized unwillingness on
the part of the Legislature to pass
any new measures, we were able
to pass the messenger bill against
great opposition and were able to
defeat three vicious bills breaking
down the restaurant law. Behind
the Sonic restaurant hills, extend-
ing the closing hours for women
in restaurants from it) p. m. to

York State Restaurant AssocizitiOn
and only the active opposition of
women's organizations to any
breaking down of our present
standards prevented the passage of
these bills. Considering the on-
slaught that has been made this
year on labor measures, we feel it
was illl accomplishment on the part
of the women to have retained on

A HOPEFUL MOMENT
it is well to remember, when our
war worries seem almost more
than we can bear, that Tennyson
almost a hundred years ago
looked far into the future and saw
not. only this great war with “the
natioiis' airy uavics grappling in
the central blue,” but saw also the
time when the war-drum should
throb no longer, and there should
be a “Parliament of Man, the
hedcralion of the World." When:
'The common sense of most shall
hold a fretful realm in awe,
And the kindlycarth shall slumber,
lapped in universal law."

ATHOUGHTFUL

MOMENT

Chance

The massive head is bent over an
old book.

The candles show the features of a
SCCl‘.

This man has poise and power. A
seeking look

Proves that no sluggish peace is
harbored here.

Some crude idea from a careless
phrase

Seized by his master mind grows
great.

His face is tense,

He lifts his fiend, and turns his
gaze .

Upon the glowing center of the
candle ﬂame,

As in its ﬁre gather all the rays.

50 now the ideas of a lifetime coii-
centratc,

For one still wondrous moment,
like a god,

He knows; he understands.

Flutter of soft brown wings before
the paint of light,

In through the lattice, out into the
t.

The man is only man again, his
glance
Followed the little but a second;

now the flame

Brings no recall of his high
moment.

“Br chance we gain he sighs.

‘and lose by chanced’
