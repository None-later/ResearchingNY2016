UTOPIAN DEMOCRACY
Continued from page /
new school discipline, having
culture and efficiency its aim.

Perhaps the host liked and most
appealing part of the lecture came
toward its close. We quote the
last two paragraphs in full:

“The paganism of Germany does
lcss harm in its conscription of
God to be the devil's pander, than
in its uplifting of beastly power
and its overthrow of the pitiful
privilege all we mortals need of
making the most of our sunshine
and brooks, clouds and trees,
flowers and birds, books and
friends, while they and we last.

“In the end, it is true that
remedies of law and economic
organism can only palliate the dis«
ease of our body politic, for our
ailment is of the mind. “it: are
needing once again the same old
gospel of Galilee, stripped of the
credal complexities, which unlit it
for our time, made again of and for
Uhc simple ﬂesh to dwell among
men."
