Mr. Decker spoke primarily on
the changes wrought on an indi-
vidttal by camp life. Although, as
he said, he had nu thrilling from
line experiences to tell of. still he
had felt all life knocks of camp
training. He gave an exceedingly
entertaining; as well as pertinent
account of life in camp as he had
known it. The fact that Y, M,
C. .\. has made camp as near like
home as p. . ble was emphasized.
Mr. ,cker said in conclusion that
one of the most valuable lessons he
had learned was that the best way
to get something ottt of the game
was to put all you have into it.

The next 5]) ‘akcr of the day was
Mr. Davisan. who has spent muci

particularly of the need of war pro-

of the most wasteful influences of
the war. Since the President can-

Democracy and  

Dean Homer Given the Eight Lecture

Friday afternoon the Dean dc-
liveretl a very interesting lecture
on " Democracy and \'\"'orld
t'eace" For the most part the
spemer was optimistic. hoping for
a real \ u‘id peace. lint he stated
emphati .ally that he believed such
a peace could be gained and pre-
served only by the sword. in part
the Dean said:

 

 

“A thousand agencies were at
work throughout the world that
made for peace. The twentieth
ceutnr has dawned upon man in
possession of many marvelous new
secrets of nature, and nations
showed a singular generosity in
their free excitatth of discoveries
which looked to the bettering of
human conditions the world over.
Here in this country we were
nnietly. persistently at work
against “all the ills that human
flesh is heir to.‘ am] the secrets of
our medical laboratories in New
York and iilllililol and instant
tn-day were the pus ons o . s—
tcr laboratories in l’atts amt Vitth
na and
whole world was Crtl‘llltli: happin
to believe“barringr the House of
liohcnzoilern—that no little cor-
ner of it dared create a monopoly
contributed to
fuller and better living; among; tnen.
\Ve. we Americans and other lib-
erty-lnvinyr peoples. somehow had
the pleasant but inherently un-
founded conviction that there was.
without the prospect of conflict. a
comfortable ‘place in the sun’ for
every people on the earth.

 

 

    

 

“\\"'e have overlooked the one
great fact of all history. 1‘ ow
mankind shall be governed is the
issue of the tie-es. That should
have foretold the present war to
the man in the street. it is in no
sense a new conflict except in its
volume and in its intensity. The
destinies of mankind throughout
the. history of the world have large-
ly been controller] by wars, and
almost every great physical con-
flict among nations has determiner]
whether a higher or a lower phiL
osoplty of life and govermuent
should ‘hreside over. the future of
the race. This is only the repro—
tlection of the drama of the aszes.
The staee is raster than it has ever
been before. the streams of human
blood are more turbulent. the re»
fined crueltics of science more aeo-
nizine‘. the lust for power and the
extension of domain less restrained.
but the issue has come down
through the centuries unchanged.

. ” The only rav of hope that finds
its way thromle this awful mias-
matic cloud of .war is this: it may
he that a new volume.in the. world's
histnrv is about to be indited'. that
the whole current oi.the record of
mankind.isahout to be chanced.
and that the issue. nf.the as: s. how

of ours may be His chosen agent
in changing the current of human
history. (Jut- democracy, which we
thought invincible, is to be pill to
its supreme test by this war.

“I choose to call the forces itt
conflict the ‘will to power’ and the
‘ will to serve.’ The ‘ will to power’
' ates fiod in its own image. dc-
L‘ tres that a prince should have no
religion save his own interest and
glory. believe in a policy of ' blood
and iron.’ elevates the _‘snperman'

life or for the priceless treasures of
mankind. observes no rule in war-
fare. rohs. lies. plunders. poisons,

“ The ‘will to serve’ bows before
the (iod of the Universe. claims no
alliance with Him. seeks to know
His will anrl to make it prevail
upon the earth, helievcs that the
State exists not for itself but: for
its people. hates war and fights
only for honor, justice and peace.

habitable for man.

“This thought i would drive
home. These conflicting currents
of human life can never 5:0 for—
