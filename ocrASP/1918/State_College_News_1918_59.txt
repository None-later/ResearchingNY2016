Prohibition —— What It Means

It must he confessed that that

hackneycd expresston, “prohibi-
tion,” is becoming~ somewhat of .a
bore. However, if we class this

word under “ conservation " we be—
gin to sit up and take notice.

Do you realize as you read the
following facts—absolute truths—-
that they are the kind that rise up
and strike one between the eyes?
Do you realize that this question
of prohibition-—-conservalion, if
you prefer the other termwmeans
that we must regard it seriously,
and stop ignoring it as we have
done heretofore?

Just think! In l917, the brewers
of the country used over 3,000,000
tons of coal. And our factories.
business places. and homes needed.
and need it! Then it requires over
200.000 freight ‘ars during the year
to haul the products used and pro-
duce by the breweries. “'l‘he
shortage of labor title to drink is a
big factor in the freight tie—up.”

Secondly. The breweries use
64,000,000 pounds of grape sugar,
and we are short of sugar.

Thirdly. “There are over 300,000
employed in the making, handling,
andsclling of the brewery products.
This is a time that the country is
crying out for labor for useful in~
dustry. if the drink supply were
stopped a large number of idle
workers would be restored to the
ranks of workers." Would not the
result be evident in more efficient
and steadier workers?

Fourthly. “ The animal retail
drink hill of the United States be-
fore the war was $2,400,000.000!
This would take up our ﬁrst Lib~
erty Loan, and in addition pav the
entire cost of the Panama Canal.
This waste of money now makes the
ﬁnancing of war vastly more (lif-
ﬁcnit, The country's animal firc
loss is about $250,000,000. but the
direct cost of liquor is nearly ten
times as great. and the indirect
cost is beyond computation."

Fifthly. “If drink were abol-
isbed, labor conditions on farms as
well as with farm machinery, fer-
tilizers, and transportation would
be so improved as to increase pro-
duction at least ﬁve per cent. This
would add 34,000,000 bushels of

wheat. or 232,0“),000 bushels of all

kinds of grain." .
stly, if we fail to enforce this
branch of conservation it will

mean that we must have with us
Heatless davs — idleness. loss of
production and proﬁts.

 

Wheatfcss days.

Lightless days—Burglary, crime.

Meatless days.

War bread—Less bread.

Food riots—Coal riots. I

ltums at home—a menace, unlit for
military or other service.

A long war followed by poverty.
degeneracy. and business de-
pression.

Must we be forced to pay that
price for our failure to do “the
right thing at the right time?”
These are not idle statements. but
real, live facts that are clamoring
for our attention now. Let us all
join in the movement. and help
gain one of the greatest victories
that ever confronted us.

SARCASM

One or two so-called witty no-
tices have been put up on the stu-
dents’ bulletin board lately and
bare caused considerable comment.
mostly adverse. No one should
forget that strangers are continu-
ally in our halls. Sarcastic, mean
spirited notices on our boards will
do much to unfavnrably impress
these visitors. ()ur own students
read the boards. ,and these notices
serve only to cause contempt for
the writer. Probably the action has
been merely thoughtless on the‘ part
of the offenders and will cease
when attention is called. Sarcasm
and wit at anothcr's expense are
the tools of the boor. Let us be
well bred.

COLLEGE YELLS

You may judge a college by the
tone, the number and the variety of
its yells. A college yell is an ever-
lasting toast to that of which we
hear so much—college spirit. No
other means of expressing loyalty
is more simple: no other so cffcc.
tivc. The student who always
knows the college yells, and always
return: hoarse from athletic games.
is the one who is well liked by both
faculty and student body. He is
the one who is alive. who lives. not
because he chanced to be born. but
because he loves life and its in-
tcrests.

Tn our college the majority of
rivalry games seem to be interclass-
Picture a basketball game where it
is a half minute till time is up for
the second half. The referee tosses

 

the ball. The score stands 8-7 in
favor of the upper classmcn. Yon-
der dishevcllcd' Freshman is grit-
ting his teeth and making an iron
resolve to throw a field basket.
The game begins with a rush. t-lis
teeth still are set; his heart leaps
as he catches the glorious prey in
his arms. For a hare instant he
hugs it to him, so glad is he to
possess it, so sure of success. He
bounces it once, twice, three times,
and pauses before the basket. ['l'e
slips under his guard and with a
bound throws the ball. Just as the
crowd see it fall gracefully through
the not the timekeepcr’s whistle an-
nounces that the game is over.
There are two classes of people
in that ball and they are divided by
a line of demarcation more distinct
than any human power could draw.
I heard a lecturer last week say
that there is no class of people
divided so distinctly as a class in
geometry. This class, he said, is
divided into two clean-cut part-s—
thosc who see and those who do
not see. in my mimf. it is much
the same at an athletic game.
There are those who see. and cheer;
and those who do not see, and do
not cheer. The non-elicerers at-
tend the game for some unknown
reason. and do not see, do not un«
rlcrstand, the spirit of the game.
But the checrcrs—they of the
happy hearts and valiant lungs, who
dare and love. to exhaust their
voices in landing skill, whether of
their fellows or rivals-let us speak
of these. They are the flower of
the college: they are the alumni-to—
be who will return to alma mater
in love and reverence long after the
non-cheerers have forgotten they
were college‘bred. The chcercrs
are they who later will make their
names felt and known in their na«
tive spheres. They are the ones
who, as they were loyal to their
college, will also he to thcir coun-
try, lifesst are the chccrcrs. for
thcv shall he cheered. College
yells are for the students. and of
the students. therefore for them be

'by the students.
