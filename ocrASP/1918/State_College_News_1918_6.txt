PROMETHEATN '

The first meeting of the Frame
thean Literary Society, for the new
year, was lteld in the auditorium last
Thursday evenin". The program
dealt with modern war literature atid

iiiusic. President Margaret Shevlin
presided.
After a vocal solo. "Keep the

Home Fires Burning," by Florence
Sttihbs Miss Slievlin introduced Miss
Jane ones, English critic of State
College, lntrot 'ig her subject,
"War Poetry," Miss Jones spoke of
a new word just added to the literary
critic’s vocabulary. "he word. is
vitainine, and it ori inates in the field
of chemistry. Here it is applied to a
class of food which falls under none
of the present classifications. its
literary ' significance is practically
identical. l’oeins under this head are
neither good works of literature, nor
entirely worthless. They possess
some of the qualities of literature,
and ii great deal of human feeling
and interest.
Miss Jones then
vitaiuincs, as follows: ‘ _
“ H; .t In l‘landcrs,” by Lliza-
betli Driscoll; "To llarry Lauder,
by Amelia llurr: “A Prayer," by
Amelia llurr; ” The Name of
France," by Henry Van Dyke;
“ Righteous Wrath," by Henry Van
llyke; making interesting comments
and explanatory remarks upon each
one. .
She paid an especially fine tribute
to Harry Lauder for his excellent
work "among the soldiers. The
selection, “A Prayer,” was, perhaps,
most worthy of note. It has an
unusual human appeal and teaches a
splendid mural. in a simple manner.
Several numbers on the program
had to be omitted, owing to the
absence of several people on the
program. The remainder of the
lime was spent in singing popular war
songs and patriotic melodies.
The next meeting will be held
after mid—year's. Stanley lleason
and Alice llrown have charge of the
program.

The Girl With The Green Eyes

Dramatics Cast

The first of a series of plays, to be
eivtn by the Dramatic Class of State
College, was presented last Saturday
CYClllllL’ iii the Albany High School
aitditOi nu, before a large audience.
"to all. was of considerable iii-
tcrcst, since it is the first play staged
and coached by Miss Agnes Ftilterer,
the new instructor in di'amatics. Miss
"tiltcrcr is well known to Albanians
for her excellent acting in several
plays given during her course as a
strident at the college. The. presenta-
tion Saturday evening gave evidence
of the same Charming interpretation
and enthusiastic work. From start to
finish the play was a huge success.

The work of Miss Sarah Roody, in
the role of “Jinny” Austin was
perfect throughout the play. As the
beautiful bride in the ﬁrst act, and
as the jealous wife in the other three
acts. her interpretation was faultless.
[t is unusual that an uiidcrcfassman
C’ll‘l take a leading role and score so
heavily. iler evident popularity with
the Albany audience, who are
accustomed to seeing Albany's young
people in the leading roles of college
plays, speaks well for her success.

Alfred Miller, as the husband of
“Jiiniy.” did some very clever act-
ing. and his work in the interests of
"Jiuiiy’s” brother deserves especial
commendatimi. ‘

Joseph Lasker, as Geoffrey Tillman,
Jinny’s brother, the unpleasant
character of the play. was excellent.
The part was very difficult, and Mr.
Lasker's interpretation and acting
were exceptionally fine. Margaret
Becker, as Maggie, Geoff's first wife.
and maid at the Tillman Mansion, did
some excellent work. Much praise
is due llazel I'lengge. who,'in the role
of Ruth Chester, Geoff’s second wife,
played well a difficult part.

 

 

“ Susie,” Jinny's cousin, was one of

Scores Big Hit

the best parts of the play, and was
admirably played by Ruth Lambert.
llt‘l’ iiiake—np was perfect, and her
ailing as the mischievous youngster
—aud laler in the pathetic farewell

scene with Jinncy—brought well
deserved praise from all who at-
tended the play.

George Scliiavone and Hester

Weaver as Mr. and Mrs. Tillman,
Jinuy’s parents, were very good.
Margaret lx’eunning, as Mrs. Cull~
ingham, a doting, societyscekiug
tuother, and William Merchant, as
l'i:ter, her dyspeptic son, drew many
laughs from Ihe audience.
Lapp, a travel—worn " Cook
't afforded niitcli amusement.

Coach’hlaroney's grand workis to
be commended. Taking raw material
as he found it, he has developed a
b: kethzill team of which all State
tire is proud. This game perhaps

   

_more than the others plainly shows

the. results of his etiicient coaching.
Williams has .the. material from
which to cheese, with Dayton and
Wright of last year's varsity men.
liesitles that they have the coaching
of \lla'ehter, known throughout the
state asra basketball coach. Coach
Maroney bucking against both brains
and brawn came thru with a splendid
victory. All praise to the work of
lllO‘Slzth College coach!

The team worked like a machine.
every pass was with lightning speed
and exactly placed. Captain Fitz-
gerald and Barry wol‘ked"with
percxsion, as if they had been playing
together for years: Many times the
ball was taken tip the entire length of
the. court for baskets: ,Colien,roiit-
weighed, kept up his end of the game
and’eaged .the llilll‘lll the second half
or SIX points. i :

Usually only those who know the
game notice the work of the guards.
Aew York State College rooters
when they glance down the court and
see Polt guarding the opponents’
basket settle back on the bleachers
with a feeling that his line of defense
is impenetrable:  '  '

V On Saturday night,_Williams 'was'
forced to try for the basket with long —
shots, -Curtin (lid not allow Captain
Dayton to score a field basket, a feat -
everyone .thought impossible.» Day-
ltl‘ll'ls said to be Williams’ crack shot.
When interviewed yesterday, Coach
Maconey expressed his great satis-
l‘action with the work ofthe’ team.

‘ he, team _ did. wonderfully ﬁne,

work: We expect torcgistcr another -
victory next Saturday night against 7
St. Lawrence."
