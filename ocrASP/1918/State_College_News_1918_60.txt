GYM EXHIBITION

The annual gym exhibition took
place Friday night in the Albany
High School gymnasium. But it
was not likc any exhibition before.
1918 starts a new cycle in gym work
in State Collcgc. From start to
finish the program was one grand
succcss~uo mistakes, no hitches—
thc cntirc work went on oiled
wheels. The two lower boards of
the bleachers were reserved for the
partakcrs, and still there was not
room for them, At the signal from
Miss Gray the girls came down the
stairs, one line on each side of the
room. Thc then followed. After a
very clfcctivc marchng formation
the performers sat down, March-
int,r tactics were ﬁrst, the girls and
thcn the men. Both were cxccllcnt
——not a discordant note in either
group.

The first of the three drills was
the dnmbhcll drill by the girls.
hliss lillcn Donohuc ‘20 and Miss
Katharine MacGarahan ’21 were
h-adcrs in all three drills. Miss
Dorothy llanncr ’20 was at; the
piano. The drill was done by over
a hundred t' I.‘ and took well with
thc enthusiastic audience.

The English country dance was
very pretty and interesting. The
girls all sccmcd so chi-apt in their
work and apparently had a wondcr—
fnl time.

The Indian club drill was donc by
the men and girls at thc same time.

I'crhaps the most spectacular
number was the work of the men
on the long horse. .'-\wciuspiring
hrcak uch haudspriugs, and somcr-
saults forward and backward. made
the audience clap and shriek its ap—
proval. The girls' apparatus work
was good. but was overshadowed
by the fact that the men were do«
ing‘ more exciting work at the same
time.

The relay was a potato rate
among; the four classes. with two
girls running for cach class. The
audience chccrcd thc aspirants for
first place. and the race resulted in
a tie between the. Seniors and thc
Juniors.

The biggest hit of the evening:
was the aesthetic dancing. The
audience clamoer for an encore.
but none was given. The entire
Junior gym class took part, and the
whole performance was very pleas-
mg.

Miss Gray and Mr. Maroncy dc-
scrvc the credit of the success.
They have worked all year long,
with every. faculty possible, to make
the exhibition a good one. But they
could not have dreamed of such a
landslide as they had Friday night.
The Albany gym was never before
so crowded. The poise and assur—
ance of the two instructors were rc-
ﬂectcd in the students with whom
they have worked. hey may well
be proud of their success. State
College is certainly Droud.

'thn the end of the program
name dancing was cnioyed until ll.
Dorothy Banner and Leon VVood-
ruff played for the others to dance.
