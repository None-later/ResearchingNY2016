DEMQCRACY AND PEACE
Cambium} from page 1

peace. There can be no safety in
the world for peacefully disposed
peoples so long as the peril of i'rus—
vsianisln exists. if the world is ever
to see peace, the forces of dcnmc-
racy must not only triumph in the
immediate issues of this ‘t‘oulliet,
but they must an armed to the
teeth so long as there-is a Beast-
abroad anywhere on the earth. A
league of nations devoted to World
peace may come: it will he a pur-
poseless thing if it is not prepared
liy force to assert its will. The way
for us to “achieve and cherish a
just and lasting peace" with all ua~
lions lies hopefully in the willing
nuss of every patriotic Ameriran
to give ‘thr last full measure of
devotion’ to that noble end.

“ n his famous Springﬁeld
speech in lRSS, employing the
Scriptures. as he often did, Line'qu
said: ':\ house divided against its
self cannot standl i believe this
government cannot endure perma-
nently half slave and half frec.‘
The very spirit of that great dis—
riple of human freedom -« pole star
of democracy. which has hovered
so tenderly over the. American na—
tion for the last 53 years, tells us
in unmistakahh- terms tn—day that a
world divided against itself cannot
stand. that the peoples of the earth
cannot exist permanently hall slave
and half free, that the ‘will to
pou-er' and the ‘will to serve ’Cau—
not aizide together indeﬁnitely upon
the earth. that there can he no
compromise between peoples who
believe. on the nne hand, in the
hr‘iliness of Might. and on the other
in the holiness of Right. and that
[it-arc for the world depends not
upon the triumph of the alleged
‘diviuc right of kings.‘ but in the
.iustiiiration hy force (if the theory
prorlaimod hv our forefathers upon
this western hemisphere. that ‘ now
vrmuents derive their just powers
from the Consent of the gm’t‘rned.‘ "
