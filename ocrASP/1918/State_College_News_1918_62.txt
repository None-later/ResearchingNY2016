was formed during tlte year 1016-17
under the leadership of Professor
l\'irtland. in the two short years of
its existenc its membership has
greatly lllL‘l ased, until it now in‘
cludes students from all classes and
depz 'ments of the college. The
side of life at State is de—
plorahly meagre. and students gladlv
welcome such a splendid organ
tion. If there were any doubtt
to the ins‘iticatirm for such a club
they have disappeared. Music Club
is thrice welcolne at State College!

Those who were among the last to
leave the building were favored with
a style exhibition by Charles. While
not a club member, Charles contrib-
uted a great deal to the entertain-
ment.

insure a success. Besides the .-\hna
Mater. everyone should know num-
bers 14, .46 and 5' in the Songbook.
Freshmen are responsible for mun-
hers 40'and in the leaflet, thc
Sophomores for 19 and 21, the Jun-
inrs for 18 and 29. the Seniors for

will make everyone familiar with
them and able to join in heartily
when the time comes.

The annual picnic and outing of
the Chemistry Club was held at the
"Devil's Den," \'\7atervlict, on Satur-
day, May 11, 19l8. To say that those
present had a good time is putting
it very mildly. and it was with sad
hearts that they left the place for
home.

JUNIOR SISTERS

 

It has been the cus‘om in most colv
leges to give evei‘y Fresh an into
the care of a Junior. The names of
tl‘e new class come in usually any
time after the beginning of the year
and the members of the present
Sophomore class select from these
names. There are two phases of the
attestion, the qualiﬁcatitms and the
duties,

The qualiﬁcations can easily be im-
agined. fiach prospective big sister
or big brother must be healthy, men-
t’allv. morally and physically. l'lis
class work must be up to par. llis
el‘al'at‘ler must be of a sort to guar-
antee the best interests of the Fresh—
man in his L‘lHll‘Q‘C. No student of
weak habits would be fit to lead an-
other in the right way. He must
have a good physique and able to ex-
emplify all that the good normal life
will do for an embryonic college
student.

The duties will vary with the indi-
vidual. Each Junior is supposed to
meet his Freshman at the station or
else '0 attend to the matter through
an agent. He must take the Fresh—
man to registration, see that he is

 

 

 

 

 

. students.

 

lodged in comfortable (punters, and
then keep him under his care for the
tryint,r lirst months.

Many questions arise in the mint
of a Freshman, and the Junior is '
pected to aid in decisions, Many
l“l"'5lltltell are so inexperienced that
a city the size of Albany and the tin-
accustmned freedom are a source of
grave danger. The despondency over
low marks, the lonelin 's and home-
sickness of the tirst leave from home,
the aptitude to break loose and the
ease with which one may get into
the wrong couniauy,—~all these iti-
duce failure. The Junior can (In
much to cheer his Freshman, to ad—
vise in study. and :0 guide in amuse~
ment.

(tn the other hand, the Junior
should guard against overshadowing
the Freshman. Strong characters
can help to develop others without
mping their own initials on the
shed product. The Juniors should
likewise be careful not to influence
the opinions of his charge in regard
to courses, professors or natural in-
clinations. The talents of each new
student should be fully nurtured.

The work is purer voluntary and
each Sophomore wishing to take a
l‘l?) in charge should consult Dean
T'ierre.
