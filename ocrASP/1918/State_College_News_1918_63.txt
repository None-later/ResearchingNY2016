THE DAY OF DISASTER

May Seventh is a Day of Dis- '

aster to Americans. We shall live
to see it a Disaster Day to Ger-
mans.

That day, three years ago, the
Lusitania went down with 114 citi-
zens of the United States.

Then we stopped the
livered thinking of neutrals.

That murder was deliberately
planned in cold blood, it was known
so far ahead that you Bcrnstorﬁ’,
01: representative of a frightful
nation, advertised in our papers a
warning to citizens not to embark.
Germany rejoiced openly in holi-
day attire at the death of women
and babes, and struck off a medal
in commemoration, needless re-
minder to us of a nation educated
only to be bestial in its cruelty.

We waited till April sixth, nearly
two years later, before we acted.
No one can accuse this big, patient,
generous nation of unseemly haste,
of angry action. Now, after three
years. our last lingering doubt of
Germany's intention has faded. We
are decided, determined, devoted.
Slow mounting anger blazes into

wh itc

fierce indignation.

Our feelings are unleashed. Re-

straint is removed. It comes as a

 

 

release'to think as we have long
wished to think. The pallid cast
of thought crimsons to the red
badge of action.

We hesitate no longer in fear of
a legacy of hate; let the future
take care of this legacy.

Our one determination now is to
WIN THIS WAR.

There are no clogging side issues,
no halfway thoughts, no doubting
Toryism, no yelping yellow (log-
gism. Outraged America shricks
for revenge.

Stark Americanism stalks abroad.
Patriotism outdistanccs Jingoism.
in thought we range alongside
great Americans who dared to be
extreme; with Franklin, who could
be humorous at the enemy tvho rc-
trcated so last that the weary
Americans could “scarce keep up
with them, pelting them all the
way;" with the intrepid Samuel
Adams, who, conservatism flung
aside, shouted “what a glorious
morning for America!” with \Vash-
ington, who deemed suicide the
best way out for a Tory; with
Lincoln, who forced issues with
iron disregard for protests; with
Grant, who hammered all summer;
with Sherman, who made his name
a thing of horror. Win the war,
all also well forgot.

“in peace there’s nothing so be-
comes a man

"As modest stillness and hu-
utility;

“But. when the blast of war
blows in our cars.

“Then imitate the action of the

tiger:

“Stiffeu the sinews, summon up
the blood,

“Disguise fair nature with hard—
favour'd rage.”

Rage now disguises fair nature.
Peace Days change to War Days.
Harry Lauder's wife rejoices that
her child was a boy and that -shc
could give him for her country.
There are a hundred ways to die:
one is sweet,——-for one’s country.
Better that; a thousand should die
nony than that one should die
pitiably.

This is no time for so—called
open-mindedncss.

We are right, Germany is wrong.
The day has passed when we could
seeone iota of right in Germany.
Our ,allics' plans are ours, Our
highest ofﬁcer is the Frenchman
Foch. We rejoice in the unusual
spectacle of American troops
marching under British command.
Race diﬂ'erences are submerged in
Americanism. 'It is ll-Demoeracy
against All-Despotism.

 

 

 

We are against the German war
code, against German militarism,
against the' German type of educa-
tion, against the German system
of government, against the German
system of diplomacy, against the
German disregard for accepted in-
ternational practices. We expect
to see the German race a pariah
race, outcast among nations, “a
punishment to be a German.”

Does this shock you? I, too am
shocked, but only at our half-
hcartcdness as 1 think of our boys,
my friends, your classmates, our
countrymen, giving their last full
measure of devotion. We need a
new Declaration of Independence
which shall be a new test for partial
loyalty, a new standard to rally
patriots.

We conﬁdently expect “another
Sedan" inllictcd on Germany in-
stead of by Germany, a veritable
Disaster Day for our encmies.

We are for our own country, and
for our allies; we have one idea, to
win the greatest war in history,
the War for Peace and 1-[umanity.

1919 MYSKANIA

 

The matter in which most of us,
especially the Juniors, are litter-
ested on Moving-up-Day, is the
selection of the 1919 Myskaula.
Each little group of us has its own
hero, its leader, who in our estima—
tion possesses exceptional quali-
ties. We are absolutely sure that
he or she should, without question,
become a member of Myskauia.
This student is, perhaps, a leader
in athletics, scholarship, ability for
organization, or a genius in some
particular phase of student activity.
liccausc we know him thoroughly,
and our immediate friends recog-
nize his talents, we have no doubt
about his eligibility for the Senior
Council.

When h'loving—up-Day 15 over,
and the highest honor of our cols
lcge has passed him by, can we be
big enough, can we be broad-
miudcd enough, can we be generous
enough, not to express our disap-
pointment, our disgust, or even
Worse, our disloyalty to our col—
lege? When the student body ac«
ccptcd the organiaztion of the
Senior Council by the faculty, no
objections were raised as to the
proposed method of selection. Why
shall we not now have sufﬁcient
faith in our faculty, and sufﬁcient
coulidence in the Council, chosen
by the faculty and the previous
Myskania, to enable us to accept
their decisions as just, and
prompted only by fairness?
Granted, a student has held high
ofﬁces in class or society, or has
had an enviable scholarship stand~
ing, or has made a record in
athletics, should this alone cause
his election to Myskania? Let us
rather think that he has had his
share, perhaps, in college laurels.

if we courteously receive the dc-
crec of choice, and refrain from ad-
verse criticism, would it not be a
step toward the culmination of that
“college spirit," to which we are
so eager to attain? Real democ-
racy is a state in which the citizens
have developed that degree of in—
telligcnt “fellowship,” which gives
the greatest aid to intelligent
leadership in the accomplishment
of the highest ent.

“Anon.”

Editor’s Note—Members of
Myskania should be chosen not as
representative of any one group,
or for any one reason, but for the
qualities in him which indicate that
he is truly representative of the
best manhood and womanhood in

our college. Election to Myskania
should not he a “spoils” system of
handing out lnurels, to people who
by common student consent have
not earned them. ‘

 

SOPHOMORE CLASS
MEETING

 

At the meeting,r Friday morning,
Dean I’ierec presented the Junior sis—
ter plan to thc‘elass. Ac.iug on her
suggestion, it was decided to have a
conmntlee to take care of the matter.
Lovlsa ‘Vcddcr was made chairman
to appeal. three or live assistants.

Sophomores were urged bv
l'lazcl‘ Pearsall, chairman of the song
committee, to come out for song prac-
ticc Ill prclnn‘ation for Moving-Up
Day.

A rousing sing lasting twenty min-
ulcs ended the hour.

‘ 1n the absence of the President,
Sarah 1\'D(ltl_\' conducted the meeting.

THINK

 

When you see the Food Adminis-
tration sign "Food Will Win the
War,” THINK—of the 68,000,000
bushels of grain wasted last year
111 making American booze.

When you recall last winter‘s
bentless days and shiver at the
thoughts of those coming next
winter THINK—01 the 7,000,000
tons of coal used last winter in the
United States to manufacture and
sell booze.

When you hear that there is a
shortage of men in mnnition fac-
tories, ship yards and on the farms,
and sec women doing mcn’s work,
THINK—of the 289,000 men, all
able-bodied, in America who are
wastingr their time in the manufac-
ture and sale of booze. Then, too
think of the mnuber made inelli-
cicnt by its use.

When in the wonderful Liberty
Loan drives you are told that a
single $50.00 bond will buy 1,000
pounds of flour, or three wool over-
coats, or 1,000 rounds of ammuni-
tiou for our boys. just stop and
T l-llNK—how much the $2,000,000,-
000 of American money spent an-
nually for booze would buy.

thn you hear that the rail-
roads arc over-loaded and that all
transportation is congested,
THINK—of the 200,000 freight
cars used during the year by the
booze business.

THINK. The students of the
nation, along with other citizens,
are thinking, and this is leading
them to act—to show their Sena-
tors and Congressmen at Washing-
tou‘, by PERSONAL LETTERS,
that the colleges of America stand
with that strong element in Con»
gress which is seeking to obtain
Prohibition for the Period of the
1 ar. Have you written your lot-
ter? \VITE it. NOW.

Delegates from 14 leading col-
lcgcs of New England, including
Brown, Yale, Harvard, eslcyan,
University of Vermont. Williams,
and four prominent women’s col-
leges, Simmons, Radcliffe, Welles-
lcy and Mt. Holyoke. attending the
Convention of the intercollegiate
Prohibition Association, passed
strong resolutions in favor of pro~
hibition during the war and for one
year thereafter.‘ They were sent to
the President, both Houses of Con—
gress, the Food and Fuel Admiu~
istrators and the Director General
of Railroads.
