ConquerED.”

WIN THE WAR ”

 

" When harle is taken to the
miller, (10 per cent becomes flour
for human food; 40 per cent be—
comes offal for cattle food.
“When barley is taken to the
brewer, 25 per cent: only becomes
offal for cattle food; 75 per cent
is wasth in making a deleterious
drink,"——Lord Davenport.
