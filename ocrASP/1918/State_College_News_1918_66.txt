MISS PERINE'
ADDRESSES
COLLEGE CLUB

“Losses of Art During the War”

Miss l'erine spoke to College
Club Friday on the losses of art
during the war, l-lcr lecture and
the pitiful ruins of Rheinis make
one hate the titans more than ever.

Miss J. rine said in part :

“if we would understand the na-

ture of the loss that has come to
the world through the destruction
of so many of the towns of Belgi-
nm and northern France during the
present war, we must call to mind
the wonderful history of this
region, as writen in the art, of
which the Rheims cathedral stands
forever in the memory as the
wonderful expression.
"As the German armies have
trampled aml desecrath and
polluted this lovely land between
the Rhine and Seine Rivers the
world has stood aghast at the ir-
reparable loss of the monuments
\ve hare come to know as our
greatest treasures and whose ruins
we will continue to mourn with a
grief that we cannot even realize
at the present moment,

"it has been said that, 'long
memories makci a great people’
and that antiquities, art, and arch—
aeology are the illustrations in the
hunk of history. to visualize the
act-a of the past. Buildings and
objects created in any age have a
value equal to the written docu-
ments of the age. and give a record
that books are unable to furnish,
so that art and history go hand in
hand in forming for us our just con-
cepts of the peoples of the past.

swim ASSEMBLY

After Miss l’iercc announced
about the parade for Saturday, Dr.
Brnbacher introduced Dr. Hopkins.
The speaker advocated that the war
be dealt with in a business way
and with thorough organization.
The way to do that. he said, was
through the \var chest. The ex-
penses of the campaign have al-
ready bccn met by private contribu-
tions so that every cent collected
will be used for actual charity. In-
asmuch as the Albany people be-
hian the movement are of excellent
standing. we can he sure that the
money will be used in the best pos-
sible way. " The war chest is the
weapon of those behind the lines,"
said Dr, Hopkins. “Everyone can
contribute.”

The speaker declared that Ger-
many‘s main efforts are spent try-
ing to weaken the morale of those
behind the lines. He said, " On the
ground of simple justice we must
support those who stand between
us and infinite peril. For our own
self-respect after the war, we must
do this.”

Dr. Hopkins told about the visit
of Harry Lauder to the grave of his
soldier son. Mr. Lauder said he
wished he might see his boy just
for a moment to thank him for
what he had done for the Lauder
name and for humanity.

Dr. lirnbacher then called upon
Dr. Richardson to speak. The white-

BASKETBALL BANQUET
Wind-up of Girls’ Season

l‘riday at six 1). m. some forty
girls armed with a spoon and a
cup attended the basketball ban—
quet in the gym. .l.’crhaps the food
was portioned less generously,
perhaps there was less of it than
usual. No one seems to know.
The mere matter of food was not
considered. The members ate in
order to stay. in fact they must
have eaten, for a number of
empty paper plates remained after-
warr. _

Sometime during this process of
cleaning plates—probably after it
was over—Lorna Austin rose. She
was toast mistress so she could
talk as long as she wanted and no
one could interefere. After a few
preliminary jokes, Lorna launched
forth into a very tine speech on
"l‘atrintism," which sounded the
note for the entire evening. it was
a jolly meeting. but it was above all
a patriotic meeting of girls, whose
loyal hearts were 100 per cent
American.

Lorna (maybe you know her as
Agnes) introduced Aileen Keefe,
senior guard, to explain what tenac-
ity meant. Aileen showed her usual
hrilliancy by translating the term
into English. It is hard to believe,
but tenacity means “sticktoitive—
nus“ or, as Lorna added “grit” or
"sand." Aileen's audience will re-
member the importance of the qual-
it V.
3Catherine Roland was the next
orationer on the subject, ” Leader-
ship.“ l'ler swift puns were too
much for her listeners. This sort of
thing abounderl: "Death is al—
ways fatal." "A jeweler working
after live should not be paid for
working over time." A rapid tire,
lasting,r a couple of minutes, left the
girls weltering in tears.

WAR CHEST PARADE
Great Date in College History.

Nine-tenths of the State College
students bravely marched in Al—
bany's great parade Saturday, mak-
ing the finest showing in the his—
tory of the institution. The great
banner made by the Sewing De—
partment, precedch the Faculty
women. The l9l8 banner and ser-
vice tlag followed and then the
Senior Class. almost in a body, and
wearing their impressive caps and
gowns, followed. The faculty wu-
men were dressed in caps and
gowns and hoods.

'l‘he Juniors carrying their ban-
near. the Sophomores with their
banner and service flag, and the
Freshmen with their banner, came
in succession. There were a great
number of smaller ﬂags carried in
the ranks of girls. Class colors
were prominent on the white ap—
parel. The faculty asked for a rep-
resentation of four hundred. This
was undoubtedly surpassed by two
hundred.

The College girls bore the march,
and particularly the long wait, well.
They have done much for the War
Chest. Many can do little more,
but those who can do more must
measure up in this week just as
they did Saturday.

MISS Jl"..\.\'.\'i£ .\i. ('ih’AY

After three years of work in State
College, during which time she has
endeared herself to all, Miss Gray,
at the‘l'hysical Education Depart-
meal, is leaving. Few instructors
ever become so vitally the embodi-
ment of all the things they wish
to teach as has Miss Gray. She
taught comradcship. fair play, the
art of being a good sport, not from
books or by precept. but by a liv-
ing example before all who knew

During three years Miss Gray has
built up four strong class teams in
basketball each year, with the
games a true, clean expression of
natural rivalry. She has taught
the girls to play for the sake of
playing—Part pour l'art—not
for the glory of winning. To her,
good playing, and by that is meant
clean and hard playing, is an art
and is taught as such.

lfer ideals of honor have been re-
flected in the girls whose lives she
has touched. This past year. the
culmination of all her efforts, has
come nearer to her ideals than ever
before. Each girl is expected to
measure up to standard. and, there—
fore. each girl does all she can to
reach that standard.

.\liss Gray has guided, often un-
consciously, the ideals and thoughts
of “her” girls—they loved to be
:alled “hers.” She has done more
than teach classes how to do
marching tactics and drills, She
has shown them how to do these
things well only as a preparation
for the greater life that is to fol-
low.

The girls have seen her in times
of stress, or danger, or trial, come
through victor, master of herself
and the situation. And her charac~
tcr has radiated into the loving
hearts of those whom she leaves
behind.

No success will be too good for
her No success will be beyond her
power. in her new held her old
friends wish her a success beyond
her dreams. They could wish for
those who have her in the years to
come, no greater blessing than just
that.

Miss Gray came unheralded and
will go so, but she takes with her

 

 

the admiration and friendship of
hundreds of State College girls who
will gr ’llly miss her.

Al‘ilSS (tray was graduated from a
Liberal Arts course in the Pennsyb
rania College for AWomen in 1913
and from the Sargent School for
lfhysiral [Education two years later.

2 was happily secured for the
State t'ollegc Faculty the same
year. tier new position is in the
University of Wisconsin. It is a
titling.r award for her worth, and she
will well till it.
