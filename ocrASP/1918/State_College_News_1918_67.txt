Again the fearful two weeks
crowd their ugly undesired faces-
into ours, and reaching out their
Spectre arms, iiiss, “ Now we've got
you. Now you can’t get away. R.

. K— can’t save you by sub-
stituting something you like better.
H. H. can't do any good by say-
ing he doesn't make 1113 questions
as hard as possible on purpose.
You’re done for. We got you."

Well, maybe they have, but let
us be cheerful. It is only tWO
weeks and I do not suppose any-
one has more than sixteen exams
in one week. It. might be worse.
Seniors, remember these are prob-
ably your last. Juniors, these
exams make you Seniors. Sopho—
mores, oh, gay young Sophomores,
pass theso exams or for you there
shall be no Prom, And Freshmen,
these are only a beginning and are.
therefore, not to be feared. We
can pass these Hun exams, whose
secret evils trample down so many
of our numbers in four years. Ex-
aminations are given us by fate to
keep us from being too carefree.
Let us mow them down and wm.

 

 

There are only ten days more of
college. What do you say if every
student makes up his mind to get
to every class on time? Can it be
done? It is neither good business
nor good manners to interrupt. the
professors. Remember—on time,
every class for ten days, everybody.

 

Can we as true Americans and
students of S. C. T. fail to help ﬁll
, the War Chest? Can we day .by
, day see signs and bulletins calling
us to “Haltl the Hun," and fail to
measure up to our‘former standards
made in Red Cross, Student Friend-
ship and Liberty Loan drives? .

By all means, no! Most emphati-
cally, No! It is our last chance to
give as a student body, and let us
give not grudgingly but freely and
fully. Remember what‘ America
has done and what she still has to
do and do not fall short of the goal.
It is for us, the students of S.  T.,
each and every one, to be 10918per

cent Americans.

 

Class of 1918: Have you consid-
ered the fact that by this time next
year we will be separated With per-
haps no possibility of our ever
meeting together again as a class?
Does that thought mean anything
to you?‘ if so‘why not plan for a
reunion now, while there is an op-
portunity? Alumni Day does not
mean much to one unless the mem-

 

bers of his own class are present,
and we probably all look forward
to wining back some time. It is
practically impossible to get so
large a group together after they
have once been separated unless
plans are made in which the whole
class can take part.

Let us tiiink about it, talk about
it, and plan for a hundred per cent
class reunion some time in the
future. Ask the president to call a
meeting and let every member be
ready to offer a plan. ’18.

LARGE CROWD OF
HIKERS GO ON FIRST
BIOLOGY EXCURSION

100 COLLEGE STUDENTS
TRAMP TO McKOWNS-
VILLE WOODS

 

The ﬁrst of the general Biology
excursions of the year occurred
Thursday afternoon, when nearly
a hundred college students and
their friends, accompanied by Pro-
fessor Woodard and Miss Raferty,
journeyed to the grove beyond Mc-
Kownsvilie. Many were unable to
leave at: three when the ﬁrst detach-
ment started, but ii strong rein-
forcement, headed by .Miss Rafer-
y's lab assistants, the Misses
Aldrich and Kinnc. joined the ﬁrst
group about hali~past six. Lunch
was the first thing on the program
for the late arrivals, while the early
comers examined and classiﬁed
specimens already collected.

The crowd broke up into small
groups to look for specimens. All
were then brought back and identi-
ﬁed by Miss Raferty, or the crack
students of the class in Biology 4.
Once in a while these infallibles
were stuck as to Latin names. but
eventually everything was properly
classiﬁed.

nearby for frogs, tadpoles, and
other curios. The one unfortunate
move of the day. was the failure to
see the tree assmg signs, and the
consequent ’reaking of the law.
But the appearance of the property
custodian, in ﬂaming robes and
with equally ﬁrey temper, added
much amusement to the party. The
poor “High School Breds" of the
group were hit prety hard. but they
enjoyed the amateur burlesque im-
mcnsely. If you don’t believe it.
ask to see their diaries for May 16.

Those of the crowd who were
forced to return early, missed the
most delightful part: of the excur-
sion, namely, witnessing the sunset
from the Jewish cemetery on the
hill.’ At the same time it should be
mentioned that the movie acted by
Peckham & C0,, with the Wild west
Scenery' of the sand hills, was
superb.

The happy, dirty, dusty appear-
ance of the crowds that went back
on the late Country Club cars spoke
well for the splendid time everyone
had. ‘Icc cream cones, purchased
at the country store near the ter-
minal, added to the characterization
of joy supreme. But along witih all
the good times. many valuable les-
sons were learned. identiﬁcation,
with common and Latin names was
perhaps the greatest, but methods
were no less important. In this
connection we should remember
the careful directions concerning
the gathering of specimens—-
namely, to gather only a. few of
each variety. One great fault in
such trips is the total annihilation
of certain plant families in a sec-
tion by the ruthless gathering of
whole armixils of plants, leaving no
chance for reproduction in that
locality.
