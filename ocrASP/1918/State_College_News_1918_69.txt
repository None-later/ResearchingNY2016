STUDENT ASSEMBLY
Continued from Page .

haired English scholar thrilled his
audience when c cried out, “ Halt
the Hun!” That poster, he said,
will be on the door of the Latin
room as long as the war lasts. The
barbarous Germans must be halted
and free people assured a right to
live. The scholar mind lamented
the fact that a nation oncc capable
of producing the wonderful Cocthc
could be led by lust of power into
such a monumental wickedness,

“it is the English llcct that has
saved America,” Dr. Richardson
said. "We must know that only
the British ships have wardcd off
attack of our shores following the
destruction of our noble allies. We
owe everything to England from
whose loins we sprang and whose
very close friend we now arc.”

.\lr. Maroney announced the ﬁeld
events for Moving-up Day and
urged the students to fill the lists.

The speaker scheduled did not
appear.

BASKETBALL BANQUET
Continued from [mgr /

Nellie Parkhurst spoke on “Co-
operation." She said that at the
ﬁrst Soph-Frcshman game, just
before second half, one of her team
was seen to be shaking violently.
“ Trembling for yourself? " she was
asked. ” No, I am trembling for the
Sophs, They don’t know I’m here.”

Maybe it was a challenge. At
any rate, Ellen Donahue extended
her five feet seven perpendicularly
from the floor and harangucd. She
revived dim memories for many
and smote the Freshmen hearts
with fear as she assailed the cars
of all with the following description
of Sophomore organization:

“When the stimulus is sounded
all nerves are at attention.
diater the end bulb of Krouse rc-
ceives the impulse, transfers it to
the afferent nerve by a.d1agonal
route. which passes it directly to
the brain center, and this brain cen-
ter sends it by the most permeable
pathway (usually over the heads of
the guardsl to the corresponding
brain ct'v“ v- which causes immedi-
ate rm :1 and the impulse ma-
jestical' .ends into the basket.”

Ellen suggested a required schol-
arship standing, Sopl1~Frcshnien
rival quizzes in rules With a sleigh-
ing party as forfeit. The four teams
should be organized With the cham-
pionship team as conned.

Dorothy Austin presented letters
to M. Cummings, B. Cunningham,
E. Donahue. F. Bohne, S. Adriance.
I. Johnston, M. Barry, M. Andrae,
M. Curtis.

Numerals were awarded to E.

Miss Gray and Miss Pierce gal-
lantly responded to pleas for
speeches and following them Doro-
lhy bade farewell to the girls whose
leader she has been for four years.

Dancing followed till 930, at
which uncarthly hour the girls
wendrd homcward.

MISS PERINE ADDRESSES CLUB
Call/Mun] from [rage I

“Dr. Weingall calls history the
‘Silver thread that. passes from
the hand of man back to his crca~
tor, and woe to him who breaks
that thread.’ This wonderful
mcdcvial period of history speaks
through its great cathedrals and
Civic buildings, and its lovely
homes, with a voice that men of all
races can understand. in the great
commmrlanguagc of the senses, of
a past rich in the very foundation
elements of Democracy.

“Art in all its varied forms is
the most reliable history of an age,
sunply because it does not deal
with concrete facts, but gives us
the work and the play of men and
. women who lived at the time; their
very handwork that we may see
I what sort of folks they must have
lbccn, to have created their archi—

tecturc, sculpture and painting,
[their great poems, dramas, music
I

 

and hand craft, all .so intimately

connected with their acts, civic

E life and worship.

 

 

The girls wish her all.

 

 

 

' TO"'T1-1E STUDENTS OF‘

THE STATE COLLEGE ‘

 

The students of the State College
who have cameras or kodaks. and
have been having their ﬁnishing
done at L. G. Schneible. corner of
Western and Lake avenues, and
still desire to get the same high
grade of work‘that is done by a
professional with sixteen years of
experience, can have same by leav-
ing their ﬁnishing at the following
places. which are acting as my
agents: Thos. J. Brennan, corner
of, Washington and Lake avenues,
Wm. Speldel, corner Central ave—
nue and Quail street, Geo. Speidel,
203 Central.avenue, or 'at L. A.
Baldwin’s store on Madison ave~
nue, just above Quail street.

24-hour service in kodak ﬁn-
ishing cannot be furnished unless
parties doing it are amateurs and
have no regard for the keeping
quality of the negative or the ﬁn-
ished picture. So take your ﬁlms
where you know that they will get
the proper treatment from start to
ﬁnish, and when you get a picture
from the ﬁlm it will keep as long
as the paper that it is printed on
will hang together.

If. G. Schneible has not been
acting as my agent since May 3rd,
and if you still wont A1 ﬁnishing,
take your pet roll of ﬁlm to the
persons that are acting as my
agents, where you will, get duality
of workmanship before speed.

Thanking the students of the
State College who have in the past
patronized me through my former
agent. and trusting that I will have
the pleasure to receive their ﬁnish—
ing through some of the other
agents, I am,

Yours for Good Work,
