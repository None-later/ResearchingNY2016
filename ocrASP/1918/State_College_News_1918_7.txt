MAIL-BOX

 

 

To the Faculty and Students of

', State College:—

Your Christmas box came on Dec.
28th and was very much appreciated
both by myself and friends. I took
it with me on the train to Portland.
as I was going there on a three days’
leave over New Year’s. It was Well
for me that 1 had it, for the train
was six hours late, and took about
eleven'hours to go the 126 miles.

lt'has' been raining almost continu-
ously since we crossed the Rockies.
The trains are all held up by wash-
outs,_so the mail is long in coming.

The camp P. O. is so filled with
m‘ail,that it'is-a’lmost a hopeless job
of getting it all sorted. There are a
great' many by the same name.
believe there are 87 John Smiths, so
it is a problem to ﬁnd the right
owner of the mail.

it would not have seemed much
like Christmas if it hadn't been for
the boxes and cards received. I miss
the snow‘and only occasionally get a
glimpse of some on Mt. Rainier on a
clcarvday. r

I saw plenty of holly and roses in
bloom in Portland and could not help
feeling sorry for the boys in the cold
army camps in the East.

Asyet I haven't been assigned to
my, company but will be in a week or
so-probab y. We have been spending
our time studying array paper work
and court-martinis, also having a
littlephysical and close order drills
each.qu to keep, us in trim.

To the Faculty and Students of
State College:—

Plcasc accept my thanks and ap-
preciation for the Christmas box. I
enjoyed the contents immensely.

.With best wishes for the New
hear, 1 beg to remain,

Very truly yours,

Licut. Inf. R. C.

To the Editor of the State College
News:—

in regard to the adoption of "god-

soiis ” which was so strongly attacked
ill. the last issue of the "News," we
wisli to point out the fact that in the
previous article referred to, the main
appeal was not for our own boys but
for the branch. This is plainly evi-
dent from the reference to the
bulletin-board notice and from the
description of the sufferings of these
men, whose loved ones are “some
dead, some missing, and others,
perhaps. captured by the Huns."
. l'or three years the “Oeuvre Mon
Soldat" has maintained its offices in
Paris for the sole purpOse of dispens-
ing cheer and comfort to the men at
the front, especially those from the
invaded district. These bits of cheer
have been in the form of letters and
packages sent by men and women
who were actuated by a sincere de-
srre tom: of service. The gratitude
which is their reward can be realized
only by reading the letters which they
receive in return.

Shall we girls who are privileged
to be students of French, and who
are anXiotis to do “ our bit" for
l-raiice, fail to help in this good work
because we fear someone will accuse
us of being over anxious to receive
our ‘ ﬁrst letter from a man”? in
these tronblous times "think for
yourself” is a good slogan.
