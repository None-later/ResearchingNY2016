DRAMATIC CLASS
PRESENTS PLAYS

 

The three one-act plays presented
In .lﬂriday evening by the Drainatics
Lila for the lieiietit of the Red
Cross were very successful. The
audience was large and enthusiastic,
and the proceeds most encouraging
to the Red Cross workers.

The “Play-Goers," by Sir Arthur
Prieru, was presented as the lirst
number on the program. All the
parts were well interpreted, and the
humorous situation was cleverly sus-
tained throughout. Special com—
inciidatiou is (hie the work of Miss
Spengler and Miss l"ischei', who, as
the parlor maid and cook respectively,
were particularly good. The part of
the bewildered husband was cleverly
played by Lawrence McMahon.

The second play was the produc—
tion of its star, Miss Ruth Fischer
‘18. Apart from the interest of local
authorship, we feel that Margaret
was commendable on points of real
merit. Many of the lines were clever,
and the parts were well assigned,
and consistently portrayed, Miss
liistlicr’s interpretation of the leading
role formed the nucleus—one might
say the entire interest—of the play.
it could not have been other than
naturally done. The promise of the
beginning was destroyed by a weak
curling. We wonder if tiiiiidity had
anythingr to do with the decided
pianissinin of the ﬁnale!

lior the third play, Lewis licach's
“The Clod," we have only the highest
commendation. The leading role was
played with real artistic ability by
Miss Doris Sweet. The part was an
extremely dithenlt one, but was most
realistically portrayed. Miss Sweet's
support was also excellent. the work
of George Scliaivone, William Mer—
chant and Joseph Laskcr livill‘f
pai 'cularly good, The greatest
praise we can extend to the cast of
"The Clod“ is to say that it left
nothing to be desired. For an
amateur performance it had unusual
merit and tinesse.

 

 

FROSH WIN
BANNER RUSH

Big Crowds Out to Witness “Tam—
ing of the Sophs"

One of the most exciting rushes in
the history of State College took
place last Wednesday night when all
honors were carried off by the Fresh.
in the lirst few minutes of the fight,
Wow ’21 succeeded in placing the
liresiinan banner on top of the 75—‘
foot smoke stack. Hand to hand
scraps followed in which, too, the
lirosli seemed to have the upper hand
of their foes. Were the Sophs down-
hearted? No! With all odds against
them, they planned and fought to the
end. never despairing, At 12 o’clock
1920's banner ﬂoated from the
ventilator of the main building. but
that building being only 60 feet high,
victory belonged to the Fvosh.

Tiattle scared heroes with smiling
faces are still dismissing the rush
and suggesting that State College
have them more frequently.

’l‘aire ’l‘t-isen 'lR Arthur Woodward
'18 and Gerald Ciirtin ’19 acted as
judges.

livery college student has at least
one l'rofessor for whom he has the
most intense regard. The seniors
often feel that they are losing these
very important inlluences, when they
graduate. But on the contrary they
might be disillusioned, if they were
to remain in college indeliiiitely. As
it is their memories will always be
exalted ones.

Most students have for some pro-
fessor at least what might be called
a “negative hero worship." in this
case, their teaching stands for that
sort which the student intends not to

Myskania '18 and ’19

Moving—up Day this year was hv
far the best in the history of the
college, and great thanks are due
to Myskania, which managed the
alfair, and to the members of the
faculty atid the stud int body, who
worked bind and complislietl a
great deal on the various commit-
tees.

Eleven o’cloCk on the morning
of May 23 marked the beginning
of the most successful Moving-up
Day State .ollege has ever seen.
At that time the student body,
about 80” strong, marched slowly
into the auditorium.

With the exception of the

 

 

Seniors, the girls were dressed
in white. EaCh l'rCSl'lmﬂl‘l girl
wore a bright red ribbon on

her hair, which hung down her
back, it is here to be noted that
one wayward child who wanted to
appear grown up did not have her
hair down in the morning. She
did put it down before the day
was over. Each l'irosh boy wore
a bright red necktie, The 1921
banner led the line of march into
the chapel, proudly carried by the
marshals.

The platform was occupied by
the facultv and the 1917-18 Mys«
kania. Visitors tilled tip all va—
cant seats and quite a bit of stand-
ing room.

The program proper then began.
Ruth Fisher described ” The Ideal
Seniorz" Hazel llengge, ” The
ideal Junior." and Sally Roody,
" The Ideal Sophomore." Each of
these speeches were very original
and clever. Miss l-leiiggc closed
her remarks: “After all, the ideal
Junior is best described by the fol-
lowing list of Juniors, one hundred
per cent. An lt.lllZ David Aaron.
Allan Cillett. Nicholas Clute. Ver-
non Clutc, Theodore Cassa'ant,

After Joseph Walker, the presi-
dent of the Senior Class, had atl-
drcssed the assembly, the class

NEW MYSKANIA CHOSEN

The most important and most
exciting event of the day was
when the digniﬁed members of
Myskania, one at a time, descended
from their seats of honor on the
platform, and marching to the
place where the selected Junior
sat, announced the name, pinned
purple and gold ribbons upon her
(or him), and then both proceeded
back up on the platform aga n.
The chairs of the men in service
were covered with ﬂags. ‘

Myskauia, it should be explained
for the sake of those who may not
have heard of it, is:

“An organization coin-inset] of
not less than ten or more than
twelve Seniors. This body gov-
erns student activitics~0ther than
athletirs. Ou'v Seniors who have
good scholarship and have shown
abilitv in student leadership are
eligible for election. V

” Tive members of this organi-
zation are elected by the faculty,
the remaining by the active mem-
bers of Myskania. Election to
Myskzinia is the highest honor ob-
tainable in State College. 'The em—
