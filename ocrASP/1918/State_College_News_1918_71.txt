. This issue of the State C011ch
News is the last for the year 1917-
18. in spite of many trying internal
conditions, the secoml year of the
kite of the News has been largely
successful and everyone feels that
it has come to stay. The retiringr
hoard of editors wishes to hespaik
to the students and faculty its thanks
and appreciation for the linancial and
material aid given by them during
the college year! But few people

realize the great and constant lahor'

connected with the editing and pnh-
11511ng of the News. And to those
few who have 11nrlerstood,——an(l have
helped lift and push, the hoard is
especially grateful. We earnestly
seek and hope to win the interest and
help of the entire student hody and
faculty for the new hoard of editors
for 1918—19. Boost the College News!
'Workl Hand in material! Criticiso
constructively!
1 ow, in completion of the year’s
- work, the hoard of editors extend
hearty good. wishes for a good re«
port card, a happy summer, and a
‘successful year to come.

THE BIG ISSUE

Several weeks ago an article ap-
peared in the News, concernng the
expected publication of a twelve-
page issue of the News. Since this
has not materialized some explana-
tion seems to he necessary.

At the time of announcement,
plans were well under way, hut a
series of unfortunate circumstances
have made do publication impossible
this year, First, the heard of editors
is not completely elected, The new
_.'1dministratinn offcers are powerless
to complete the election until advised
to do so hy Myskauia. Accordingly,
there are mo few people in pa 'tion to
continue the work of a spec‘ issue.

Secondly, the aid promised hy
Press Cluh has been unavoidath
withdrawn, The president, Ray
Townsend, has‘gonc into the service.
Other work has prevented the secre-
tary, Doris Sweet, from assuming,r
the responsibility. And now June
examsare upon us—aud no big issue
can he worked up at this date. it
is greatly to he regretted that such
a worthy effort has been blocked
and hindered.- rather than pushed, but
"there is no use crying over spilt
milk.” Let us hope for netter things
next year!
