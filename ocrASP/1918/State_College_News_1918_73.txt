THE LITTLE RED cRoss
IN THE WINDOW

 

I walk through the streets of the
city '
In daylight and dark, sun and rain,
And the little red cross in the win-
(low,
I see it, again and again.

It reeks not of rank nor of station,

it cures not for wealth or its lack.

lint the little red cross in the win-
(low,

Has all, rich and poor, at its back.

It speaks of a oneness of purpose,
Of a cause that is dear to each

heart.
Oh, that little red cross lit the win-
(low,
Shows that each one is doing his
part.

Now. all are not gifted nor littctl
'l‘o tiiltc tip the work “Over
There," ’
lint a little red cross in the window,
Says “At least, i am having a
share."
So here's to the work that's so noble,
.-\nd the workers. far over the son.
And dear little red cross in the win-
(low,
Here’s a prayer for the cause and
for thee!
