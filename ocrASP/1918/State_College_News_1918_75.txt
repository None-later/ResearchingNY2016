The great war has already drawn
heavily upon the resources, both ma—
terial and human, of the colleges
throughout the country. We have
visibly, at least, felt the strain less
than many of our neighbors. The
current of our college life has run
so smoothly during this year our
country has been at war that the
casual observer would be inclined to
say we have not been affected by it.
An examination of the college cata—
logues will show, however, that our
Freshman class numbered 346 in Sep-
tember, 1916, and 182 in September,
1917. This is the direct result of the
war. Our attendance of upper class
men has been remarkably good, and
the ‘Dean reports that with a very few
exceptions, all of the three lower
classes have registered for next
year. Undoubtedly *we shall experi~
once a further drop in registration
with the enrollment oi the incoming
class in September.

To the outsider we have gone on
for the year much as before. and
every member of the faculty and
every student knows that we have
been constantly thinking and acting
in our small way upon the issue of
the ages. The sixty or seventy stars
in, our serviccﬁagnspeak eloquently
enough of onr‘patrio'tisni. .The gen-
erous way in which students and
faculty have given of their time and
of their means for one worthy cause

'dence are on trial.

or another has given us new respect
for ourselves and new conﬁdence in
the ultimate success of the cause for
which we willingly work and give.
Students have observed with much
pride and satisfaction the splendid
response of the faculty in the various
compaigns that have been made dur-
ing the year.

But we have donemore than mere-
ly to give the limit of our time
and bur resources. Members of the
faculty presented in recent weeks a
notable course of lectures upon the
general subject of " Democracy,"
which did much to give us renewed
conviction that this business of mak—
ing the world a lit place for free
men to live in must be carried
through. The sum of our patriotic
endeavors, of our willingness to sac—
riﬁce, of our determination to pro-
serve the heritage of" our fathers
may be relatively small, but its
weight will be found in the balance
and on what we ﬁrmly believe to he
the right side, Our way of life,
our free institutions, the very founda—
tions of our faith in Divine Provi—
Here at State
College we mean to do our part to
see the trial: through and to hasten
the judgment in the interest of the
civilization for which our country is
at war.
