FOREWORD

 

Th " big issue " has materializedl
In spite of many adverse and dis-
couraging conditions, the hopes of
the Press Club and News Board have
been realized with the publication of
this ﬁnal edition of the State Col-
lege News. The purpose of the work
is to advertise State College. A
copy will be sent to each of the nine
hundred high schools of New York
State, in an attempt to interest_pros-

pective college students in coming to ’

the ﬁnest college in the State. An
attempt has been made to represent
every branch of college life, and to
give a resume of the scope, inten-
tions, and work. of the various de-
partments of instruction. The work
of advertising is started, and much
remains torbe done by loyal students,
alumni and faculty.

he task of compiling and pub-
lishing so extensive a résumé has
been stupendous, and much credit is
due those who have undertaken it.
The'editing‘ and compiling has been
supervised by the Board of'Editors
for the years 1917-18 and 1918-19.
Invaluable assistance was rendered
by Miss Doris Sweet '18. Secretary

' v . of the Press Club of the College, and

by Miss Christine C. Fowler. ’18.

~ student body, sinng and collectively,
t

of fomier‘ years. is to be greatly
regretted that the relationship be-
.tween alumni. and present student
body is not stronger—void it is to be
hoped that bonds .of contact shall be

' made and stress thened rapidly in the

coming. years. nthe publication and
circulation of this issue, the present
student body is making the ﬁrst ad-
vances.- Will the alumni (and alum-
nae) do their share?

While the primer purpose of the
as been stated
above, to advertisethe college and to
interest pros ctive students to come
to’ State Colege, there is a second
reason for the ﬁnal publication. A
cop of the big issue had been prom-
ise to each member of the Alumni
Association who paid his dues, and
it seemed to be necessary for the
student body, represented by the
News, to keep this promise. Accord-
ingly, the big issue, published at
student expense, is hereby put forth,
and copies are to be sent to loyal
alumni. '

The question now is, will the
alumni meet us half way? The
News and Echo both have received

l but little alumni support in the past.

The alumni mailing list of both is
pitiably short. Only recent graduates
show their interest. The publication
of the June number of the Echo
presents a typical example of alumni
support. This was called “Alumni
and Faculty Number." The faculty
responded whole heartedly and loy-
ally to appeals for articles, but out
of thirty-ﬁve personal letters of up
peal to alumni, only three were even
answered. 15 this loyalty? The
answer is obvious.

It is not necessary to illustrate
further. It can but be evident that
it is necessary for co—operation be
tween alumni and student body. Will
not every member of the Alumni As-
sociation meet his or her obligation
by subscribing to the News and to
the Echo - Y? Then will they
not show a bit ol personal interest

Members of the Alumni Associa-

WHAT ARE YOU DOING
TO HELP WIN THE WAR?

 

This is not a war alone of the
army and navy; it is not a war just
for men from 21 to SI years old;
it in not a war only for those who
have the time and inclination to
prosecute it. This is the war of
every American man. woman and
child. This is your war, if you are
an American. Are you doing your
bit, orare you going ahead as usual,
uuieting your conscience by saying.
“ The government has not called
one?” The government may not have
mentioned your name: but your
country called you the day war was
declared.~ Defense of your country
is identical with the defense of your
home. Are you letting your neighbor
defend your home without any as-
sistance from you? Are you letting
someone else ﬁght your battles for

- you?

Can you say, when the war is over,
“1 have done my‘bit? 'f

" This great State College of ours
was once a small college. With a
steadily increasing number of stu-
dents, courses and activitieswere
graduallyrextended, until to-day the
boundaries of the student—lite iii-
closc stretches reaching from the
Chemistry Club to the Promethean
Literary Society, from the Athletic
ﬁeld to the Auditorium, from the
Library to the Gymnasium, from the
Senior to the Freshman, and so on.
from one extreme to the other,
touching upon scores of independent
groups, each with a different inter-
est and none visibly connected with
another. The close observer must
discover now the presence of that
same threatening danger in our
student-life, which history shows to
have once existed in the United
States—a decided trend toward sec-
tionalism and away from centraliza-
tion. We have by no means reached
a crisis. but there is a great need
for some moans liy which there can
be brought to bear upon our student
body a similar influence to that which
is being exerted upon the nation by
the railroads. the telegraph, and the
telephone. There has arisen a need
for a means of bringing each ex-
treme of our student life into direct
touch with the other, of making this
heterogeneity into which we have
grown a solid unit, a single collegiate
family. What better means than a
newspaper, such as the State College
News, to achieve the desired results?

“ Thus do we launch this journal
on its course, with every conﬁdence
that it ﬁlls a long felt want, and that
its policy, ‘to make each faction of
our student organization know and
appreciate all others, to upholdthc
maintenance of fraternal regard and
friendly rivalry among all, to work
for co-opcration between all sections
and for the solidiﬁcation of the now

separately wasted energies in the pro--

motion of a real, distinct, and en-
thusiastic spirit of loyalty to State
College,’ will in time do much toward
placing the record of our achieve-
ments outside of the classroom on a
plane in keeping with our standing
as America’s leading teachers col-
lege.

Class 0 1918, on
Publishing a Weekly

THE LITTLE RED CROSS
IN THE WINDOW

 

I walk. through the streets of the

City,
In daylight and dark, sun and rain,
And the little red cross in the win-

ow. _ I
I see it, again and again.
It reeks not of rank nor of station,
It cares'not for wealth or its lack.
But the little red cross in the win‘
ow, . .
Has'all, rich and poor, at its back.

it speaks of a oneness of purpose,
Of a cause that is dear to each

cant.
Oh. that little red cross in the win-

ow, ; _ ,
Shows that each one is doing his

 

 

Thus began this student enterprise
which has developed inthe course
of two years into a dynamic force
behind college spirit and unity.

These beginnings were a mere
dream of the Class of ’18, in the
spring of 1916. With the reopening
of college, Alfred Dedicke had in-
itiated the dream into realization, and
with a committee appointed by Pres-
ident Brubacher, the News began to
appear weekly. The following peo-
ple wcre members of that ﬁrst com-
mittee on publishing a weekly news-
paper:

Alfrcd Dedicke, chairman; Doro-
thy Austin, Stanley Heason, Eloise
Lansing, Lillian Magilton, Joseph
Walker, Henry Greciiblatt, Kathryn
Cole, Mildred MacEwan, Benjamin
Cohen, Ray Townsend, Maud Rose.
ElmettaVan Deloo. This committee
was later divided into sub-commit-
tees according to the principle of
"differentiation of labor,” Alfred
'Dedicke became Editor—in-chief, and
Lillian Magilton Business Manager.
Willi two such capable students at
the helm, the paper was well man-
aged and edited.

With autumn, 1917, came a greater
change. The ﬁnancial worries of the
News vanished with the appearance
of the Student Tax. When war was
declared a year ago, the rush of
State College men to the colors in—
cluded many of those connected with
the News. Since this was a new
venture, and not ﬁrmly established,
Myskania appointed a board com-
posed of persons who had been on—
lhusiastic workers on the board of
the ﬁrst year. These were: Senior
Editors, Lillian Magilton, Kathryn
Cole, Mildred McEwan, and Stanley
Henson; Junior Reporters, Caroline
Lipcs, Alfred Miller, Donald Tower,
Dorothy . Banner, Bernice Brenner,
Dorothy Wakerly. Miss Magilton's
resignation early in the year was ac-
aceptcd‘ with regret by the.board, for
her work had always been of the
ﬁnest. The paper was edited in " ro~
tation " by a Senior Editor and two
Junior assistants.

Next year's board will have, Edi-
tor—in-chicf, Donald Tower, 19; Man-
aging Editor, Bernice Bronner, ’19-,
Business Manager, Caroline Lipes,
’19; Assistant Business Manager,

Van Allen Lobdcll, 20; Associate Ed- ‘

itors, Edward T. Springman, ‘20;
Dorothy M. Banner, 20, Kenneth P.
Holben, "20, Bertha West, '20, Elsie
Hanbury, '20. '

Now, all are not gifted nor ﬁtted
To take up the work "Over
There."
But a little red cross in the window,
Says “At least, I am having a
share."

So here’s to the work that’s so noble,
And the workers far over the sea;
And, dear little red cross in the Win-

(low,
Here's a rayer for the cause and

tort eel
