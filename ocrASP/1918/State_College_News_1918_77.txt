MYSKANIA

 

One of the most important steps
in the development of student spirit
and power was the organization, in
March, 1917, of a Student Council.

The purpose of the Council is to
serve as a means of communication
between the students and the faculty.
It is an honorary body composed of
not more than twelve nor less than
ten Senior members who have won
places of prominence in scholarship,
athletics, or other college activities,
and who have capacity for leader-
ship. The members are elected as fol-
lows: Tbe faculty appoints ﬁve
Juniors before the spring recess of
each year; the outgoing Council adds
ﬁve, six or seven to this number.
The President of the Senior Class
becomes a member cx-oﬂicio, if he is
not one before election to the class
presidency. The duties and privileges
of the Student Cotincil are: To have
seats upon the platform at student
assemblies; to govern interclass con-
tests, other than athletic; to admin-
ister the rules governing the various
competitions for ofﬁces; to admin—
ister the college customs; to control
fraternity and sorority practices; to
call the Freshman Class meetingr
for electing ofﬁcers; to govern all
class elections; and to make recom—
mendations to the student assembly.

The 1918 members of this year’s
council were, May Fillingham, Lieut.
Irving Goewey, Stanley Heason, Cap;
tain Jesse Jones, Eloise Lansing,
Verna McCann, Lillian Magilton,
Agnes Moore, Maude Rose and Jo-
seph Walker.

The 1919 members are: Harriet
Church, Agnes Dennin, Francis Fitz—
gerald. Caroline Lipes, Dorothy Rob-

rerts, Gertrude Schermerhorn, Earle

Sutherland. Donald Tower, Lyra
Waterhouse, Winifred Wcmple and
Henry Wood.

The Young Women’s Christian
Association is one of the largest
organizations in State College—hav—
ing about 350 members. Any woman
in college who is a member of an
Evangelical church may become_an
active member of the Association,
Any other may be an associate mem-
her, The regular devotional meet-

' in!“ are held in the auditorium every

Wednesday afternoon at 4.40. The
leaders are students, members of the
faculty or prominent outsrde speak-

ers.

The executive body consists of a
cabinet of ﬁve oﬁicers and eight com-
mittee chairmen. The cabinet has
portant business and to procure for
themselves the inspiration they Wish

  

to pass on to their friends both in
the Wednesday meetings and else-
where. The oﬁicers for this year
were: President, Verna MoCaun. ’18;
Vice-President, Caroline Lipes, '19;
Secretary, Anna Fortinier, ’20; Treas-
urer, Louise Burleson, ’18, and An-
nual Member, Lovisa Vedder, '18.
The committee chairmen ‘were: 50-
cial, Gertrude Schermerhorn, ’19;
Religious Meetings, Maude ,Rose, ’18;
Social Service, Mildred Guernsey,
'18; Conferences and Conventions,
Jennie Muhlemann, '18; Association
News, Beulah Kittle, ’19; Voluntary
Study, Anne Smythe, ’18; Missions,
Lyra Waterhouse, ’19, and Lunch
Counter, May Fillingham, ’18.

As few people realize the amount
of work accomplished by. this Asso-
ciation, a. few notes are in order.
The Vice—President is chairman of
the Membership Committee. In the
past it has also been her duty to see
that letters were written in the sum—
mer to entering students, that they
were met at trains in the fall, helped
to ﬁnd rooms and adjust themselves
to their new life in various other
ways. It is the duty of the Annual
Member to keep the Association in
touch with other Associations all
over the country. The Social Com-
mittee entertains the Freshmen when
they ﬁrst arrive, gives a large res
ception shortly after the Faculty Re-
ception early in the fall and several
parties during the year. The Social
Service, or Extension Committee, is
one avenue through which C, A.
serves the community and thus
passes on to others something of the
joy, inspiration and spiritual help
which we receive at college. *Marion
Moore, who has charge of this work
next year, is planning to enlarge the
work so that there will be sub-com-
mittees working with or for such in-
stitutions as the Rensselaer Street
Mission, the City Association, the
Deaconess’ Home, the Red Cross, and
the old Ladies' Home. The Voluntary
Study Committee takes charges‘of
Sunday School classes for college
girls, Bible and Mission Study
Classes. Owing to the lunch counter,
which has been run by the Associa-
tion for the last four or ﬁve years,
our ﬁnancial budget has always been
very extensive—this year it in-
cluded sums adding up to about
two thousand, The money is spent
in running the various committees,
the Lunch Counter and for Confer-
ence. Among other things, we gave
a couple hundred to the Armenian
Fund this year. ,

The Advisory Board is: Chairman,
Miss Anna E. Pierce (Dean of was
men), Miss Lillian Templeton, Mrs.
