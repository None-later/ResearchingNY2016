DRAMATICS r .

 

The Dramatics, Class, although a-
part of the college curriculum, is
essentially a club’ to which all stu-
dents may belong with the consent
of the instructor. Here all those
who feel that they have dramatic
ability may ﬁnd an opportunity to
display it. The class puts out at
least one standard play each
semester, in which parts are taken,
managing is done and stagework
superintended by students.

Miss Futterer, the instructor, is a
splendid interpreter of dramatic art
and succeeds in giving the class
that interpretation. She is recog-
nized in the capitol district as a
charming and capable artist in her
work, and not the least among her
appreciative audience are the stu-
dents and faculty of State College.

. With her valuable help and criti-
cism, the class has given two pro-
ductions this year. The ﬁrst was
" The Girl with the Green Eyes," by
Clyde Fitch, in’ which Sally Roody,
'20 and Alfred Miller, ’19 had the
leading parts. They were well sup-
ported by a large cast including
joseph Lasker, '19, Hazel Hengge,
’l9, William Merchant, ‘20 and Ruth
Lambert, ’19. The play was pre-
sented before a large and appre-
ciative gathering of students,
faculty and Albanians. '

Second semester at different plan
was attempted. Three one-act
plays were given, each interesting
in its own way. The first, "Play-
goers,” by Sir Arthur Pinero, was

resented by May Leonard and

awrence McMahon, '20, assisted by
Alice Spengler, ’18 Ruth Fisher, ’18,
Gertrude Simmonds, '18 and others.
Following this was “ Margaret" b
Ruth Fisher, ’18, who took the lea -
iiig part. This play received special
attention on account of the author
and leading part. Others who sup-
ported Miss "Fisher were George
Schiavone, '20, Almeria Becker, '20,
Sally Ready, '20 and Hazel Hengge,
'19. The last play of the evening
was “ The Clod" by Lewis Beech.
This was different in that it was a
tragedy, while the others were
comedy. Tragedy by amateurs is
usually a failure, but “ The Clod "
was a phenomenal success. The
leading parts were taken admir-

‘ably by Doris Sweet, ‘18 and Joseph
Lasker, ’19, who were aided in their
interpretation by William Merchant,
'20, George Schiavonc, ’19 and Law—
rence McMahon, ’20.

In the presentation of the plays,
much credit is due the stage and

property managers for their cﬂicient .

work. They were ably assisted by
Iz’aliul Mauvi le, ’21 and Ralph Baker,

Besides this work of putting on
plays, the class spends some time in
technical study of the drama and'
the works of standard dramatists.
-The class is kept informed of
artistic productions to be given in
the capitol district, and various
members see and report on plays.

 

V _ SOCIAL ACTIVITIES

 

The student life at State College
is not all work. here are many
social events which take place dur-
ing the year, making the feeling of
cooperation and fellowship among
the students and faculty{ stronger
and of more real value. eceptions
for Freshmen are the first things on
the program. These are given by the
faculty, Y. W C. A., the Senior and
the Junior classes. In addition each
class has one party which is for that
class alone. On thcsc'occasions the
gymnasium is put into use for
something entirely different from
the daily gym classes.

 

All classes but the Freshman are
given a week-end in. which “to
strengthen their class spirit. Junior

week is the ﬁrst. This is always held ,.
immediately after first semestcrex-w
' The festiviv’. I

nminations are over. I
ties include a reception,‘ banquet,

prom. and basketball game. The :
Sophomores come next with a re-

ccption, soirc'e‘ and basketball
game. Senior week is at commence-
ment time in June. It includes
Class Day, Alumni Day, Bacca-
laureate Address, Commencement
Exercises and Senior Ball.

COLLEGE PUBLICATIONS

 

The students of the college sup-
port four publications. Perhaps of
chief importance among these is
the State College News, a copy of
which is here represented. The
paper is published weekly through-
out all the college year. It aims to
represent all of the interests and
agtivities of college life. It is dis-
tinctly a “ news ” publication.

The oldest student publication is
the Echo, a literary magazine pub-
lished monthly by a board of
editors elected from the student-

ody. The articles, poems, etc., are
the work of college students.
The alumni department of this
magazine is the only alumni pub-
lication. ,

The Pcdagogue is the annual
yearbook, published by the Senior
class. It contains a record of the
class history, the student activities
of the college as a whole, and for
the current year, and humorous or
satirical impressions of college life.

The College Songbook is a col-
lection of songs of our own Alma
Mater, of those of other colleges,
and of familiar songs. The price is
$ '00. Books may be ordered of
Miss Lois B. Knox, chairman of
the Songbook Committee, at the
college. If book is to be mailed
add 25 cents for postage.

COOPERATIVE BOOK
STORE

 

Next year we .are to have, right
here in college, a real live book
store. Neither professors nor stu-
dents arc to be bothered any more
with book-hunting. When books
are needed they will be ordered
through the college ‘book store.
Students may buy them at cost.
Stationery, note books, pencils,
and other things interesting to stu-
dents of S. C. T. will be sold.

Peo it: who have frequented the
Red ‘ross room this spring have
noticed the good~looking shelves
and counter that have been placed
there lately. ext year these are
to be used by the book store. Re-
member the place, room 13 l, on
the lower ﬂoor of the main build-
mg.

,The committee in charge consists
of three faculty members, Pro—
fessor Decker, Professor York and
Professor Sayles, and two student
members, Lyra Watcrhouse, repre-
senting ’19. and Margaret Kenning,
representing ’20,

MOVING-Up DAY

 

Of all the festivities of thccollcge

‘Eyeur none is more important and

more enjoyed than the annual. Mov-
Day, which occurs in the
latter part of May, This marks the

’ ' of commencement festivi-

Iiitcr—clnss rivalry ends at midnight
of the day preceding, usually with a
good stiff scrap between the Fresh
and Sophs. College work is sus-
pended for the day. In the morning
the formal exercises take place in
the audiorium. Music and speeches
occupy the ﬁrst part of the program.
Then follows the “moving up "
process, when the Freshmen take the
seats assigned to Sophomores, and
so on through the classes.

Next in order comes the choosing
of.Myskania, the senior honorary
council, for the next year. The
classes then form an aisle down the
chapel steps and down the walk,
through which the other classes pass,
in turn. ,

Each class stages a “ stunt" on the
campus.

The entire afternoon. is given over
to athletic meets of various sorts.

This year a new movement was
started, in the nature of a Campus
Sing. This took place in the even-
ing, and was successful to the nth
degree, There was community sing-
ing and “step singing ” by the va«
riotis classes. Tth followed a
couple of hours of dancing on the
campus. This feature of the day
will be remembered almost more
than any other—and it is a feature
that has come to stay.

INTERCLASS RIVALRY

 

Freshmen Victorious

 

The men at State, though few in
numbers in comparison with the op-
posite sex, do not lack in pop and
(lcviltry. From the very ﬁrst of the
year the Freshmen and Sophomores
start a good natured rivalry, which
continues until the supremacy is
finally settled on Moving—up Day in
the spring.

When the Fresh enter in the fall
they are rcquestedU) to wear pur-
ple and gold caps and follow the
rules in the “Bible” presented them.
These apply to the girls as well as
the men, although they are to wear
buttons rather than the caps. Woe
to the one who disobcys and is
caughtl

A little later the Basket Ball Sca-
snn begins and then there are many
battles royal for the winning of the
championship. This year the Sophs
carried off the honors.

An attempt of each class to “cop ”
the banner of the rival is the chief
point of contention. This may be
obtained, according to this year‘s
procedure, by hook or crook, but
legitimately there were two banner
rushes. This coming year ﬁve rushes
have been planned, including salt
rushes, cane rushes, etc.

The deciding contest comes on
Moving-up Day at the athletic field,
when the fellows participate in vari~
ous events, with a baseball game as
the wind-up. Then, in the evening.
at the step—sing. the judges announce
the winners of class rivalry. This
year the Frosh came off ,VlClOl‘lollS
and will work to the utmost to keep
their hard~carned laurels.
