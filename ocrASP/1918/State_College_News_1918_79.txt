Hold Tltle for Second Con-
secutive Your

 

Wednesday, the 20th of March,
brought the» 1917-18 Inter-class bes-
ketball season of State College to a
close. The Class of 1920 was de-
clared “ Champions,” they having de-
‘eated the Junior class, the ” runners-
up " in the league. The '20 men hold
the title now for the second consecu-
tive year, having won the “Cham-
pionship” last year.

The series played was the result
of a “get-together" of H. . so:-
bell '18, N. J. Force ’19, L. M. Mc-
Mahon ’20. and F. .R. Bliss ‘21, man—
agers of class athletics, aided by A.
C. Manncy, athletic coach of the col-
lege. At a meeting of the Board of
Managers in the fall of '17, it was
decided that an inter-class series he
played between the four classes of
Ftate College. The board drew up
1. schedule, which was as follows:

DATE TEAMS scour:
Feb. .

4 Frosh-Soph 4-28
6 Junior-Senior 20—7
11 Frosh-Junior 13~21
13 Soph-Seuior 36-9

March

4 Frosh‘Senior 1216
6 Junior-Soph 10-13
11 Fresh-Junior 5-25
13 Soph—Senior 25-10

Also, six rules governing the play
of the series were drawn up and
agreed to by all members of the
ioard.

The ﬁrst game, as may be seen
from the schedule, was played the
ﬁrst Monday after mid—years. The
series played proved to be very in-
tcresting’, as the teams, according to
their standings of “won and lost,"
were tied four different times during
the season. In fact, the teams at the
end of the season stood as follows:

Team Played Won Lost Pc.
Sophomores .  6 5 1 .833
Juniors .  . 6 5 1 .833
Seniors .  6 2 4 .333
Freshmen . 6 6 ‘ .000

 

The “tie off" game was played a
week after the schedule closed.

The Sophomores, led by Captain
Lobdell, simply walked away with the
game, the score being 31—12.

Fitzgerald, Burk Polt, Gui-tin, Nicholson, Cohen, Coach
a

Mo ronoy,

Those are the men of whom State
College students are justly roud be-
cause of the great work which‘thcy
have done on the basketball court
this season.

At the close of last season the
prospects for the 1917-18 season were
the brightest they have ever been for
any. We hoped to have Jesse Jones
and lrving Goewey, of last year’s
team, back in the fall, but their en-
listment caused the expectations of
State College enthusiasts to take a
tumble.

However. when Coach Maroncy is-
sued the ﬁrst call for practice, a large
number of former members of the
class teams and also several new men
at State College, reported. The ad-
dition of Barry, the former Troy
High School star, to the squad, gave
Purple and Gold stock quite a boost.

Coach Maroney certainly accom-
plished wonders for State College.
He came here a stranger to Stale
College and State College activities.
Ry hard work and skillnt application
of his knowledge of basketball he
built up a strong, hard-working bas-
ketball team from inexperienced men.
The team which he formed was the
best that State has ever had from
the standpoint of games won, and
also from the standpoint of clever
playing.

State vs. Manhattan

State opened the season by losing
a hard fought contest to Manhattan
by a score of 24-26. The game was
closely contested from start to ﬁnish
and. although Stutc lost, it only
served to make her men all the more
determined to win when they met
Clarksou the following week. Again
State played in hard luck and on the
small end of a 27-29 score when the
ﬁnal whistle put an end to a game
which was thrilling in the extreme.

tate vs. Union

Then came the Union game. Cap-
tain Fitzgerald led his team-mates
against the undefeated Union ﬁve at
Schenectady. Although Union won,
State made a splendid showing
against the Garnet men. It was a
great struggle, with Barry and Fitz-
gerald playing in whirlwind fashion.

State vs. Williams

On January 12 the team went to
Williamstown to play against the
Williams ﬁve, which was being
coached by Ed. Wachter. our former
coach. Everyone expected Williams
to win, but the attack launched by
our men was too strong for them to
checld, and our guards held their for-
wards down in splendid fashion.
Fitzgerald and Barry “cut loose”
and scored from all angles of the
court. When the ﬁnal whistle sound~
ed. the score stood 33—23 in favor of
Coach Maroney’s men.

State vs. St. Lawrence

This was followed by a victory
over St. Lawrence, at Albany, in one
of the fastest games of the season.
The game was close throughout. but
the superior floor work of our men
brought them out on top.

State vs. Pelham
Then the Pelham Naval Training
School team, composed of former col—
legiate basketball stars, came to A1—
bany and defeated our team in the
fastest game played on our home
court.
State vs. Clarkson
On February 8 our men traveler]
to Potsdam. where they defeated
Clarkson for the ﬁrst time on a
northern trip. Barry and “Fitz,” as
in previous games, played a sterling
article of basketball. and their fast
accurate passing and shooting were
too much for the Clarkson guards.
The defeat of Clarkson on her home

 

ruler Sutherland, Stars of ’17-’18.

court was almost as great a surprise
as was the defeat of Williams at
Williamstown. '

The strain of the trip and the
gruelling of the night before weak-
ened our team and they lost to St.
Lawrence at Canton on'li‘ebruary 9,
after a desperate attempt to check
the scoring of their fresher oppov
nents.

State vs. Pratt

This was followed by a defeat by
Pratt, at Albany. Our fellows put
up a splendid ﬁght and played a great
game against their opponents when
one considers that Pratt has won 12
consecutive games this season. Van
Leyen proved to be too much for
the State guards and rolled up a
score of 18 points, chieﬂy through his
accurate cagiug of the ball on long
shots. Captain Fitzgerald gave a re—
markable demonstration of foul
shooting during the game when he
scored thirteen points out of four-
teen tries—a percentage of .929.

Southern Trip

The southern trip, which was taken
the next week, was marked by three
hard games. The ﬁrst was lost to
Manhattan 2427. The next night
0111' fellows lost their second game.
to Pratt. “Fitz” and Barry played
sensational basketball. but lacked
strong support, and were unable to
pile up a large score against the
strong Pratt quintet which has not
lost a game on its home court this
season. The following night the
team played against the undefeated
Stevens team in [*Ioboken. The long
trip and the preceding games told
their story. Our men were nimble to
put forth their best article of basket—
ball aud lost the third contest of thc
trip.

State vs. Aggie!

The season was brought to a ﬁtting
close on March 9, when Barry, Fitz—
gerald, Springmann, Nicholson and
Polt defeated the Massachusetts
Agricultural College team in one of
the best games of the season. " Fitz "
and Barry scored almost at will in
the second half, each caging ﬁve ﬁeld
goals in the period. it was the good
work of Springmann at, center which
enabled State to roll up such a score.
lle outiumpcd Whittle of the
“Aggies” and his floor work was
great, it was a fast. clean game and
a splendid victory for State.

Taken as a whole. this season has
been the best we. have ever had, in-
stead of one of the poorest, as early
indications seemed to point out that
it would be. We have won more
games and bigger games than ever
before and throughout the season the
spirit has been better and the playing
as a rule has been superior to that
of former seasons. When one con-
siders that the men were all inex-
perienced at the beginningof the
soasnn, there is inst cause to be proud
of the ﬁne work that they have done
under the clever leadership and able
coaching of Mr. Marouey.

As we look back over the College
year certain activities stand out
more prominently than others be;
cause of theimmeasurable fun and
pleasure they afforded us. Among
these. we ﬁnd that girls‘ athletics
holds a prominent place. It has
been one of the most successful
years that the Girls’ Athletic As-t
sociation has ever had. e have
had all those activities which go to
make up the pleasantest part of
college life—«basketball games,
hikes, gym frolics, hockey and
tennis games, and association with
girls who were full of life and‘ col-
lege spirit.

ur ofﬁcers this year were:
President, Dorothy Austin, ’18,
Schenectady; vice-president, Har-
riet Wolsey. ’20, Utica; secretary,
Agnes Denuin, ’19, Albany; and
treasurer, lsabel Johnson, ’20, Al-
bany.

One of the best affairs of the
year was the gym frolic of mem—
her 7. Tim girls in their gym cos-
tumes rompezl through a glorious
evening of stunts, games, eats and
dancing, it was such a success
that another one had to be given in
the spring.

The, basketball season was un-
nsnally line this winter. During
her three years at State College,
Miss Gray has bitilt up four strong
class teams each year with games
that have been true expressions of
class rivalry. She has taught the
girls to play for the sake of playing,
not for the glory of winning. The
Class of 1920 won the inter-class
championship. No liner team
work or speed could be found in
any college than that which the
Sophomore squad exhibited on the
basketball court at State College.
The captains of the squads were:
Senior, Dorothy Austin, Schenec-
tady; junior, Agnes Dennin, A1-
bany; Sophomore, Beulah Cunning-
ham, Chasm Falls; Freshman, Mary
Austin, Troy.

The tennis championship has not

yet been won. The victor will be
awarded a silver loving cup.
‘ Friday, May 17, at 6 p. 111., some
lifty girls, armed with a spoon and
a fork and a cup, attended the has-
ketball banquet in the gym. Per-
haps the food was Dortioncd less
generously, perhaps there was less
of it than usual. No one seems to
know. The mere matter of food, or
Mr. Hoover, was completely . for—
gotten. The toastmistress, Lorna
Austin ‘18, sounded the keynote of
patriotism, which rang through all
the other toasts. Aileen Keefe ’18,
Catherine, Boland ‘19, Ellen Dona-
hue ‘20, and Nellie Parkhurst '21
gave toasts. The president of the
association presented the college
letters to the members of the cham-
pionship team and to three Juniors,
Marie Barry, Magdalena Andrae.
and Marian Curtis.

Those who won their class num—
erals were: Adelaide Hill, ’18,
Catherine Fitzgerald, ’19, gnes
Dennin, '19, Catherine Boland, ’19,
Caroline Lipes, ’19, Anna Burrell,
’19, Ellen Donahue, '20, Isabel John-
son, '20, Sarah Adriance, ’20, Wini-
fred Darling, ’21, Jessie Darling, '21,
Mary Gral-m, '21, Helen O’Brien, ' ,
'bzllary Austin, ’21, and Isabel Neville,

Miss Gray, our instructor in
physical education, and Miss

ierce, the Dean of Women, re-
sponded to calls for speeches.
The ]party was saddened by the
know edge that Miss Gray was
there for the last time. This past
year, the culmination of all her
efforts, Miss Gray has brought us
nearer than ever to her ideals of
