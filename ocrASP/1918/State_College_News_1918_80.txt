NEW REQUIREMENTS
FOR GRADUATION

 

D’urin the year the Faculty
Council lias materially modified the
requirements for graduation and
’limited the bachelors' degrees
without reference to individual de-
partments to A. B. and All
candidates will pursue a speciﬁed
number of required subjects and
will: pursue a major subject with
not less than 30 nor more than 40
hours, and a minor with not less
than 20'nor more than 24 hours.
All candidates for the A. B. de—
gree must take one year of science
work and at least two years of one

of the foreign languages studied

in high school. All candidates for
the B. S. degree must take at lcas:
two years of science work and one
year of a foreign language.
Further distinction between the
two do rees is made by limiting
the sub ects which may be chosen
by candidates for each degree.
Thus in the A. B, course majors
may be chosen in English, French,
German, History, Latin, Mathe-
matics, and Spanish; and in ‘the
B. S. course in Biology, Chemistry,
Commercial Education, Fine Arts,
Home Economics, Industrial Edu-
cation, Mathematics, Ph sical Edu-
cation, Physics, Frenc , German
and'Spanish. _One hiindr_ed and
twenty-four hours are required for
graduation in‘ all courses.

a radical‘modiﬁcation in the re-
qiiiremcnts for the Master’s de-
gree. One, year of successful

SUMMER SESSION

 

The ﬁrst summer session at the
college, which was held last year,
was distinctly successful both in
point of numbers and in the per-
sonnel of the student body. Two
hundred and ﬁfty students were
enrolled, many of them normal
school and college graduates with
several years’ experience in teach-
ing. The second session, which is
to be held from July 8 to August 17,
will offer enlarged opportunities
for profitable summer work for
undergraduates who wish to ac-
cumulate credits, for candidates for
the Master’s degree, and for both
elementary and high school teach-
ers who seek to improve. them-
selves in service. In all 45 courses
will be offered by 26 instructors.
Members of the regular Facility
will give the greater number of
the courses. Visiting instructors
will include Mr. Lamont F. Hodge,
assistant superintendent of schools
of Yonkers; Miss Lillia W. Olcott,
specialist in drawing in the State
Education Department; Dr. Albert

Greene, Albany; Miss Ruth G,
Slocum, supervisor of physical
training in the. Albany public
schools; Miss Francisca Martinez,
teacher of Spanish in the Dunkirk
high school; Miss Emma K. Fitts
and Miss Clara Perley from the
Sargent school, Boston.

Dean Harlan H. Horncr, who
hail so large a part in the organ-
ization and success of 'the ﬁrst ses-
sion, will be the director. He in-
vitcs correspondence with prospec«
tive students.
that the second session will out-
strip the First in point of numbers
in spite of war conditions.

CAPITOL DISTRICT
‘ ADVANTAGES

 

Albany and its vicinity offer
many advantages both education-
ally and socially. College should
broaden the lives and minds of its
students and State College surely
offers such inducements.

The Education Building contains
a large reference and reading room
in its library. In addition there
is the periodic reference room and
the law and medical libraries.
Chancellor’s Hall is in this build-
ing, where lectures by brilliant men
and women are given. On the top
floor is the museum containing an
unexcelied collection; worthy of
especial-mention isthe 'Inilian ex-
hibit. Besides this building there
is the Albany Historicnl and Arts
Society, several splendid libraries,
the State Geological Hall, and the
New York State Capitol. The
students have a coriiiai invitation
to take advantage of those oppor-
tunities.

Outside entertainment is oﬁered
by Harmanus Bleecker Hall, which
presents standard plays, musical
comedies and cxce tionally fine
concerts. Proctor's r>anlehcatre
has vaudeville and moving p_ic~
tiires, with the bill changed tWice
a Week. There are several
“movie” places, chief and bcst'of
which are the Colonial. Hudson.
Pine Hills, Clinton Square, Leland
and the Regent.
