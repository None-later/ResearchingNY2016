" Lit. Dig.” in turn was hurried thru,
And B. B. Breese attacked;

With awful venom glared he then,
But soon his mind enrapt

With rods, and cones, and lens and

suc
l-le most forgot to curse that Dutch.

Just then a mighty din was heard
(Themeighhor’s cat was out),
The Wind joined in, the curtain

appet- .
Hurrah for the second boutl
Hc wrestled and writhcd with Atkin-

son
As Laokoon of old;
His pen, it spurtcd with ﬂuid rare,
His teeth gnashed, tho ﬁlled with
gold.
How terrible his accent
As he read “ The Argus" aloud:
His landlady in the room below
No more to drink, avowed.

Now Psych and all such terrors past,
Ulysses yawned with sleep;
His drooping ears and glowless eyes
Told of his meditations deep.
The clock struck one, yet—
ll is not gold that glitters:
One last fond‘ lrmk he needs must

ave
At the text on "Balsam’s Bitters."
The goo was eaten, the dish mas-
sage , v
Our solitary grind undressed:
He donned his robe of newspaper ads
And laid him down to rest.

Financial Aid in the War

In a time of war not only energy
must be expended, but money must
be given. State College has been
as unselﬁsh in this service as in all
others. The students and faculty
have responded in a remarkable man—
ner to every request for funds.

The ﬁrst call was for the Student
Friendship Fund, to which all col-
leges were asked to contribute. The
faculty and students may well be
proud of their record, since State
College was the third on the list of
New York State colleges in amount
of contribution, although the enroll-
ment of students is comparatively
small. Counting faculty and stu—
dents the sum in round ﬁgures of the
gift was $3,000

Next came the three Liberty Loans.
in which the faculty have been 1
per cent. For the ﬁrst loan the sum
of $5,000 was collected, and for the
other two_$10,000 in each drive. The
students have been splendid in their
res onse to demands for economy
an sacriﬁce.

The War Chest drive for the city
of Albany included State College,
although the majority of its students
do not claim Albany as their resi-
dence. However, they together with
the factulty, contributed $2,800 for
the Chest. Once more the faculty

 

were 100 per cent” and the students
nearlyvso.

In addition to these there have
been many other requests for funds.
Contributions have been made, to the
Knights of Columbus and other or-
ganizations. besides many yearly sub-
scriptions to the Red Cross.

Red Cross

I The latter half of this semester has
In some classes been devoted almost
entirely to war work.

The members of the ﬁrst year
Dressmaking Class have made twen-
ty boys’ suits, consisting of waist and
trousers, and the Freshman Sewing
Class, eight infants' laycttcs, each
consisting of- the following articles:

2 dresses

1 jacket

1 bonnet

3 flannel bands
3 ﬂannel waists
3 muslin waists
3 shirts-

2 pair bootces
l blanket

12 diapers

The boys’ suits and the infants' lay-
ettes are to be sent to the Belgian
Relief, The Handwork Classes have
made thirty‘six pairs of socks for
the Red Cross. '

Since March 18th. nine lessons
have been given to a volunteer
group of college students (not in the
Home Economics Department) on
the following subjects:

War Breads (including yeast

breads and quickbreads)

Cakes and Cookies

Desserts

Meat Substitutes

Candies
These lessons were given in the
form of demonstrations by the
Senior irls in the advanced cookery
class wro have made a special study
of this work.

An attempt has been made by the
Department to assist the matrons who
are feeding the college students to
adjust themselves to the demands of
the United States Food Administra-
tion. Miss teele has given ﬁve
demonstrations to these women on
the following subjects:

Quickhreads
Desserts

Salads

Meat Substitutes
Canning and ‘Drying

Two general lectures have been
given before the student body by
Miss Van Liew on the food situation.

The women of the faculty have
met once each week for Red Cross
work. The following shows the re-
sult of these meetings:

40 pairs of socks
23 sweaters

6 scarfs

6 pairs wristlets
3 helmets V

4 pairs pajamas

Dean Pierce, with the assistance of
faculty and students, has made and
donated one afghan, and another is
nearing completion.

MEN'S ATHLETICS

 

Continued from Page 5

Manager Sutherland deserves the
praise of all. hen he took up the
work where it had been dropped by
Manager Dedicke he was forced to
devote a great deal of his time to the
formation of a schedule. State Col-
lcge owes him a great deal for the
splendid work which he has done,
Handicapped by conditions at the
start, he nevertheless built up one of
the best schedules we have had. His
business ability was reflected in the
manner in which he handled the
games and in which he took care of
visiting teams. ’
