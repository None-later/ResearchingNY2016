RED CROSS AUXILIARY
The college Red Cross Auxiliary
has completed a successful year.
Organized late in the fall, rapidly
gotten under way and loyally sup-
pOrted by faculty and students, it
has been doing work that the col-
lege may'well be prbud of. Every
Tuesday and Thursday afternoon
girls in Red Cross caps and aprons
have met in room B to make sur-
gical dressings under the direction
of Mrs. Ronald Kinnear. Monday
and. Wednesday evenings and
_ Monday afternoons the girls have
made hos ital garments and
v clothes for elgian children. Girls
who couldn't sew did their bit by
pulling bastings. Girls who neither
sewed nor made dressings did
knitting—in the corridors, on the
street, even in classes!
We already have .gifts of $50
from the Dramatics' Class and $5
from the Spanish club with which

to buy materials for next year. v

Now we need girls to use that
material'every afternoon they can
spare and work in'the rooms in
Milne High School. If every wo—
man plans to do her bit next year
the Auxiliary will have a more
successful year than the past one
has, been and our boys will feel
that the girls in State College are
backing‘up their work at the front.
