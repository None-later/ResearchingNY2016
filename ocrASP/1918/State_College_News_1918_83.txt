Then they hiked to the top of the
mountain. .Lunch over. the bikers
divided into groups, some seeking
ﬂowers, some to go over the bear
trail, some to the cavern. A col-

dogs for the upper classmen. The
rain on the liomeward trip did not
dampen the girls' spirits any. It
was a perfect day, and some (le-
