BANNER RUSH

 

Hy Marion A. Beale, ’20
Long ago there was a fresh class
In the halls of alma mater.
Which so smartly and so kindly
Wished to start some college spirit,
Never thinking, oh, those children,
That they were still young and

foolish. _
Then it was they stole a banner
From the Sophs, a yellow banner;
Stole it, hid it, yelled and shouted:
“ Look at us, oh, Sophs, and wonder
At our brain, our nerve. our sinew."

Then the council, wise and pow'rful,

Said the Fresh could keep the
banner

if by might they could defend it.

Said,'oh, Fros‘h, get a committee,

And. oh, Sophs. you must do like-

Thus it ‘ appened that the Fresh-

Met the Sophs in deadly combat

It was raining, cold and windy. ,

That while cute and even cunning,
They were not yet past their child-
