Pres. Brubather Makes Official Announce-
ments Concerning Student Amy
Training Corps

fi'hc \rVar .l)epartvment has ap-
pointed a committee on education
and special training for the purpose
of maintaining the educational in—
stitutions of the country at their
highest possible efﬁciency through-
out the period of the war. The
committee has two sections.
l’rcsidcnt Mcl.aurin of the Massa-
chusetts institute of .Technology is
director oi the college training;
(I. R. Dooley is director of special
training: i'rof. C. h’. Mann, for-
merly head of the department of
physics in the University of Chi-
cago, now in the same position in
the Massachusetts institute of
Technology, is the educational scc-
retary of the general committee.

The War Department looks to
the colleges of the country to turn
nisb educated men for commis—
sioned officers as well as to pro-
vide men with technical training in
engineering and chemistry and
such constructive activities as are
needed behind the battle lines. in—
cluding machinists. electricians,
Carpenters, plumbers, signal corps
men, etc. The Student Army
Training Corps is the agency by
which these different phases of
training will be provided by the
college. The Corps is divided into
two parts, Section A consisting of
the regular college men of the
country who have matriculated in
their respective colleges on the
usual basis of eiitrance‘require-
inents, namely, high school gradu-
ation or its equivalent. This sec-
tion will receive ten hours a week
of military training in addition to
fourteen hours per week of regular
college work, The list of aca-
demic subjects approved by the
War Department is as follows:
English, French, German, Mathe—
inatics, Physics, Chemistry, Biol—
ogy. Physiology, Geology, Geog-
raphy, Topography and Map Mak—
ing, Meteorology, Astronomy, l'ly«
giene, Sanitation, Descriptive
Geometry, Mechanical and Free
Hand Drawing. Surveying, Eco-
nomics, Accounting, History, In-
ternational Law, Military Law.
Government. It is hoped by this
program to give the basis of intel-
ligence. judgment and character
which is required of commissioned
ofﬁcers. All men in Section A are
potentially ofﬁcer material and
will be sent to Oﬂ‘iccrs’ Training
Schools if they can demonstrate
that they possess the necessary
qualiﬁcations in personality and
training.

Section B of the Student Army
Training Corps consists of men
selected by the draft hoards of the
country on the basis of rammar
school training and certain voca-
tional and industrial experience.
These men are distributed among
the colleges of the country which
have equipment for the teaching of
industrial subjects. Their training
is entirely along mechanical lines.
The men in State College are

 

trained as machinists, automobile
mechanics, surveyors, electricians,
sheet mctal workers, plumbers,
carpenters and bench wood work-
ers. They also receive instruction
in war aims.

The Student Army Training
(anps will be organized about Oc-
tober lst. liy that time the bar-
racks and mess hall on the prop-
erty adjoining the college building
will have been completed. Until
that, time students of the college
must provide their own housng
and subsistence. Notice will be
given through the State College
News and on the Bulletin Boards
regarding the {physical examina-
lions and the date of induction to
service. Men should begin their
college duties as in other years and
not allow the prospect of their new
status to interfere with effective
work in the early days of the term.

Section A of the S. T. C. is
organized by the voluntary induc—
tion of college men into the ranks
of the army. A physical examina—
tion is required just as rigid as that
required for entrance into the
United States Army on any other
basis. After induction the college
men will receive quarters, susten-
ance, uniforms and equipment from
the government. The War Depart-
ment will pay for their entire col-
lege maintenance. These men will
remain in college until the War
Department orders the command-
ing ofﬁcer of the college to detail
them to other service. It is the
intention of the War Department
to leave the men at their college
work as long as possible, but no
guarantee is given for any speci-
ﬁed period. It is likely, however,
that men 18 years of age on or be—
fore September thh will be able to
finish the college year; that men
l9 years of age at that time will re-
main in college until next spring.
and that men 20 years of age at
that time will be in college until
Christmas. The college yea-r will
be divided into three terms. The
terms end respectively December
let, March 22nd, and June let.
it is the expressed intention of the,
War Department to ﬁll the places
of men called from the colleges by
properly qualified men from depot
brigades. This would mean that
the college will have a full quota
of men in training throughout the
year. in the case of Section B.
however. the men have a deﬁnite
period of training, namely, two
months. As one detachment is
graduated another one takes its
place, being sent to college by the
various draft boards of the country.

be college men of Section A
have ﬁve possibilities open to them
at the time the War Department
calls them from college into other
service. They will be selected at
that time according to their per-
formance and assigned to military
duty in one of the following ways:

ing some of the number. The
greatest enrollmcnts were in the
English, Education. French and

The fundamental purpose of the

but rather a high quality of service
to those who were fitted to profit
by the instruction offered. it is
hoped that provision may be made
next year for wider offering.» to
particular groups of teachers and
supervisory school ofﬁcers. The
State CollegeAbas a unique oppor—
tunity to be of distinct service to
the schools of the future through~
out the State. .
