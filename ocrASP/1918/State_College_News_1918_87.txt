ALMA MATER

 

Four years ago, when the Senior
class ﬁrst entered State College.
its members were green, scared,
homesick Freshmen. too. Among
the ﬁrst tasks assigned to one of
the sections of English I was to
write on the topic, “A Freshman's
Idea of His_Alma Mater."

One “Frosh,” who never did any-
thing in or for college, and who
alteerard went home—sick, blue
and discouraged—wrote:

."State College is a brick building.
There .are three of them."

That was all his alma mater
meant to him. Three cold brick
buildingslr  i .

Meanwhile the other members of
’lQM stayed, by, worked, played,
laughed and lifted. Before many
days State College meant a home,
a mother, a place of joy, a place for
serivce—a true alma mater. And
the days and years since have
served to strengthen that view.

Year after year State College
holds Out the same welcome to
Freshmen. Juniors play the big
sister and brother part, Seniors
watch the little ones with deep. in-
terest, and the Sophs make the fun
to keep the newcomers cheeredup.

But much rests with the Fresh-
men themse ves. They must come
half way. They, too, must work

and play and laugh and lift. rThey\

must learn to enjoy. their pleasv

REMEMBER YOUR
GOVERNMENT

With the return to college this
year there is a line of duty to
country and Alma. Mater which, if
each student read the signs aright,
he cannot but see open .to him.

111 April, 1917, this nation took a
decisive step and entered the great
conﬂict Which has now for four
years rocked the foundations of
civilization and liberty. In Octo-
ber of that year active participation
had so far advanced that many
students had gone into the service,
fall athletics were practically at a
standstill and the Second Liberty
Loan had begun.

This October rounds out the
ﬁrst college year of the war. And
it is right to consider a college
year in connection with so gigantic
a conﬂict as this war, for the Ser-
vice Flags that fly from the pole of
every university and college
throughout the Union, the empty

’i rooms in every dormitory,.bear ac-

tive witness to the men institutions
of learning, large and small, have
contributed to their country.
Indeed, the war has so decimated
the student bodies of many of our
colleges as to leave but a handful
of men who can return. And what
of their part? Many of them are
doubtless as anxious to serve as
their fellows who have left their
mark on every ﬁeld of Europe from
Belleau Wood onwards. And serve
they can. It is wholly right and‘
honorable for them to return to
their studies if they will do their
share in the work which the‘gov-
ernment has called others to fight.
Their share is to subscribe to the
Fourth Liberty Loan. Not that
many students, if any, would berapt

.to deny this statement, but there

are those who would plead inability
to subscribe on many' grounds;
And there is no excuse!  .

Since the day George Washing-
ton called Alexander Hamilton. a
graduate of Kings College, to act
as his private secretary because
of the marked lack of educated
men fit to perform such a task, our‘
colleges have contributed many of
their best men to‘ the' service of
their land. and the government, in
return. has done its best to assure
freedom of thought and liberality
of education for all who so desired.

50 at the beginning of the sec-
ond collegeyear ofr'the war let
every student remember this fact
and make it his individual duty to
subscribe to‘his country's loan. '

it JUNIOR srsrna's
‘ ADVICE

 

No doubt. Frehsmen, you have
been told time and time again that
we welcome you to State College.
Has it really become monotonous
and meaningless? But we do mean
our cordiality because, although
you cannot take the «place of those
who were graduated last June, you
can ﬁll the gap and enter into all
the activities that will make you
one of us.

Homesick? Naturally. In two
weeks’ time you will have forgot-
ten all those “surreptitious tears
and queer feelin's" when you are
launched in the midst of studies
and good-natured rivalry with the
Sophs. Wait 'tiil you hear Profes-
sor Risley’s opening lecture on his-
tory, and how to take notes, and
billet dotle That is an awe-inspir-
ing time, ‘Frcshmen, and the joys
of high school history classes will
fade into oblivion. Now here is a
secret: If you are very good (cm-
phasis on the very), perhaps Pro-
fessor Rislcy will teach you the
rough, naughty song that is sung
in the wild and Woolly West. He
taught it to us in summer school,
and we were enthralled, for we did
not have to take a single note ‘on
it—the teacher supplied those!

Now, in regard to studying,
please do not take life so seriously
that your brow will wrinkle up like
corrugated iron at the word " recre-
ation,” It is not necessary to stay
bumped up over your books seven
nights a week to get “A’s” and
"B's." Chances are you will get
"D's" and a disappointed view of
college life instead for the simple
reason that you are mentally tired.
Please do not make the mistake
thinking that we do not advocate
studying. We do, but we also ad-
vooate a mixture of pleasure with
that studying that will make remin-
iscences of college life happy ones.
For instance, in regard to recrea-
tion. there is Y. W. Join Y. W.
and see what splendid meetings are
held every week. The parties given
by this association are events‘to be
remembered. he Newman Club
is another society. Anyone may
join this Catholic club. A series
of lectures is given during the win~
lcr months that is well worth at
tending. The Canterbury Club
(Episcopal) membership is open
to all who care to join. Informal
parties and lectures constitute the
program for the year. Last, but
not least, is G. A, A. You must
jam that! What with hikes and
gym frolics that are more fun than
a three-ringed circus, our lives
would be a dull lot without these
bright spots to cheer .us up. Gym

frolics are—well, you Join G. A. A.‘

to find out. and you will never re-
‘gret it. These are just suggestions
for you newcomers. These socie-
ties, together with Promethean and
the Music Club. stand out foremost
for the socialside of State College.
-But life should not be dull for
you Freshmen. Remember. the
Sophs are your sworn enemies. and
the paces they are planning and
conjuring up to put you through
are sure to he terrifying to any-

‘ to see

 

. 1' v ‘I .
one—butyou! The upperclassmen
are' looking forward-with interest
What you are going to do to
the Sophs. Every time you can
“put one over ’em,” that is a score
for your side. Be sure to take this
“rivalry business" good naturedly.
Do not get sore. but put your heads
together instead and spring some-
thing on your friendly enemies that
shall call forth'cheers from your
spectators, the upperclassmen.

it must he confessed that this is
not very stirring in its appeal—for
ours is not the ability to arouse to
valorous deeds, but it is a hint of
what is expected of you. Again,
Freshies, welcome—and go to it!

A JUNIOR SISTER.

GREETING FROM
PRES. BRUBACHER

 

I greet the State College young
men and young women at the open-
ing of the new college year with

igh hopes and courage. The year
will be a momentous one. Our
country is in the heat and turmoil
of a great and righteous wa-r. Our
men under arms and all good citi-
zens are dedicated to sacriﬁce and
service. For the first time America

“,will be able to bring to bear a
I cons1dcrable

percentage of its
strength against the enemy. With—
111_ the present college year America
w1ll be able for the ﬁrst‘time to
stand fully armed for the great
cause of Democracy. College men
Will contribute an important part
to this end. State College through
the Student Army Training Corps
w1ll train and Send forth within
the year about 2,000 young men,
some as commissioned oh‘icers.
some as trained technicians, some
as privates, all as loyal Americans.
It is a great task; it will be a
memorable year. All college stu-
dents, men and women, will have
delight in after years in looking
back to the events of this year;
we may sayin the words of Aeneas,
" fora-rm ekhaer olim meminisse inva-
hit.” We are moving ‘forward
through high endeavor to a vic-

torious end. I
A. R. BRUBACHER.

GREETING FROM
THE DEAN
To the Students:

5 I sit down at my desk at the
college to respond to_1he request
of the Editor of the News for a
word of greeting to the students.
a dozen squads of men .in khaki
are marching .back and forth in
front of‘the main building. I can
hear distinctly the attempted
rhythm of their tread, as they
march across the concrete walk.
The command which I hear most
frequently is: "Squadsl Right
about! March!”

It occurs to me that‘this 'com-
{hand is symbolic of all'that is tak—
mg place in these momentous days
throughout the country. A little
over a year ago the American peo-
ple. after enduring to the very
shreds of their patience and for-
bearance the aifronts and insults
and deliberate atrocities oi'the
Germans, gave themselves the de-
cisive command. "Right about!
March!" And that gratifying com-
mand is to prevail, and we are all
dady to respond to it, until this
war is triumphantly and unquali-
ﬁedly ended in the interests of the
civilization for which we entered it.

We are proud here at State Co!-
!egc of the response of our own
number under the colors to the
country's command. We are
proud. though we are deeply sad-
dened at the~thought, of the new
golden star that has been added to
