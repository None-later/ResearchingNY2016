our service ﬂag in’ recent Weeks.
We are proud that our honor roll
will soon contain a hundred names.
And We are all ready to answer
the ever-present command of the‘
country. Indeed, we shall be an-
swering it every day in the ensuing
year; even though we do not wear
uniforms and go to the battle
front, if we “carry on" with
patience and with determination
and with honesty of purpose the
tasks which fall to our daily lot.
We shall have cause enough for
keeping a firm grip upon ourselves
during the coming year. Many of
us will scan the casualty lists with
very tlccp concern. it is a high
time for making the most of things.
I hope that the year will be rich
for every student in the satisfaction
which springs from the possession
of hard but justly earned accom-
plishments. Very sincerely yours,
HARLAN H. HORNER.

STATE COLLEGE
HONOR ROLL

 

Aid of Students Demanded

 

During the past few months the
going to the colors of many more
State College men has made the
official list incomplete. Dean l—lor~
her and Myskania are endeavoring
to prepare a complete and authentic
list at once. Any student who can
give the address of any 5. C. stu—
dent or alumnus in the service to
the Dean Will kindly do so at once.

RED CROSS NOTES

 

The following announcement,
which was omitted from the ﬁnal
June issue of the “News,” will be of
interest to the college.

Contributions to the College Red
Cross Fund were made by the fol-
lowing: Class of 1918, fifty-so: dol-
lars and forty-three cents; the
Dramatics Class, fifty dollars, and
the Spanish Club, ﬁve dollars.

The Red Cross workers of the
summer session at the State College
for Teachers have worked hard this
summer, and ave made 500 kit
bags, 15 pairs of socks, and have
ﬁnished 80 pairs of socks made by
the ﬁremen of Albany. These
were told off, labeled and wrapped.
Miss Marian Van Liew has been
in charge, assisted by Mrs. E. F.
Peterson and Mrs. F. Frear.

DOCTOR DEGREES
CONFERRED IN JUNE

Dun Homer Given Pd.D. Degree

Several Doctor of Pedagogy de-
grees were conferred at the com-
mencement exercises in June. 0f
great interest to the students is
the‘ fact that the name of Dean
Har an H. Hornet of the college
occurred on the list.

 

Others upon whom the degree
was conferred are:

Herbert Seeley Weet, A

Suvp’t of Schools of Rochester,

N. Y.
Harry DcWitt DeGroat, ,
Principal of Cortlaan Normal
. School.
Samuel J. Slauson,
Sup't of Schools of Bridgeport,
_Conn.

PRES. BRUBACHER MAKES
ANNOUNCEMENT.

Continued from page 1.

A. Transferred to a central Ohi-
ccrs’ Training Camp; or,
' B. Transferred to a noncommis-
sioned Olliccrs' Training School;

or,

C. Assigned to the college where
they are registered for further in-
tensive work in a specified line for
a speciﬁed time; or,

D. Assigned to Section B of the
S. A. T. C. for technician training
of military value; or,

E. Transferred to a cantonment
for duty with troops as a private.

It is noteworthy of attention
that the scheme is genuinely demo-
cratic. College students are not
given deferred classification. They
will be called from college soon
after a majority of the men of the
same age outsith of the colleges
have been drafted. A man in Sec—
tion ll may be transferred to Sec-
tion A on the demonstration of
ability and litness, thus opening av
way for every man to a commis-
sion on the basis of character and
efﬁciency. These facts should jus-
tify the S. A. T. C. as a scheme of
military training and it should pro-
vide the country with a sufﬁcient
number of trained men as commis-
sioned ofﬁcers. it is unfortunate,
of coanc, that men have to be
commissioned before they have
completed their college Work, but
this is due to the war emergency.

State College has pride in the
work it is thus able to do. It has
already sent some hundreds of
young men into the ranks from
Section B. They will prove their
worth as technicians along various
lines. In addition to our list of
men in the service who have won
commissions both in the Arnly and
the Navy we shall hope to send
forth men to Oﬁicers' Training
Camps who will have the requisite
basis of high character, intellectual
acumen and patriotic devotion. It
is for the young men of State Col-
lege to demonstrate that they have
thgse qualifications. It will then
he a pleasure for those charged
with this ditty to admit them to
this high opportunity of winning a
commission in the United States

Army.
A. R. BRUBACHER.
