 THE SUMMER SESSION

. Continued from page I.
large enrollments, however. in both
the French and Spanish classes»

Courses in Physical Education
\vere offered in summer session
this year and were planned with
twu purposes in mind: First, to
afford special teachers opportunity
,for advanced gymnasium practice
and for training in methods; and,
second, to meet the needs of teach~
ers of other subjects who expect
tohave charge of the physical
training work in schools in which
a special teacher is not employed.
Mr. Arthur C. Marouey. regular
college instructor in physical train-
ing, had charge of the courses un-
til July 18th. He left college to
respond to the call of his draft
board at Springﬁeld. \lass. From
there he went to Camp Devens.
Miss Emma K. ths, visiting in‘
structor, supervised the courses for
the remainder of the summer.

The institute for the Training of
:Teachers for Foreigners, which
was conducted at the college each
morning from 10 to 12 o’clock for
the first three weeks of the summer
session. received enthusiastic_sup-
port. Sixty-one teachers were reg-
istered in the course. which was
under the supervision of Mr, W. C.
Smith and his assistant, Mr. A. J.
Rejall. This work is being offered
by the State Education Department
in several summer schools and is
the direct result of legislation en-
acted at, the last session. Dr.
'l‘hnm'as E. Finegan, Acting Com—
missioner of Education, calls upon
every educator in the State to do
his part to make “ English the lan:
guage of every American citizen.”

Entertainments of a social na-
ture were held in the college gym-
nasium each Friday evening during
the summer, Mr. C. hristen-
sen was chairman of a splendid

committee who worked ceaselessly'

to make these affairs a success.
The program of entertainments for
the Friday evenings included army
night. faculty night, a circus, a
gymnastic exhibition, and a fare-
well party at the end of the session.
On July 27th the students had an
excursion to Kingsth Point.
While the need for amusement and
periods for relaxation was not
overlooked, nothing was done
which entailed great expense.
Wartime economy was practiced
throughout the session.
