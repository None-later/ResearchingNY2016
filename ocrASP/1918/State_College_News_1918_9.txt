I CAMOUFLAGE I

Heard in Physics quiz.

Prof. to Ed. S.—What is a vacuum?

Ed,—] have it in my head but I
can’t explain it.

 

Several of our readers have asked
for the meaning of this word

Of late the scene paintcr's art—
tcchnically known as camouﬂage—-
has raised the concealment of batteries
and their observation posts to the
realm of the uncanny. According to
Major Wagstnffc, you can now dis-
guise anybody as anything. For
instance, you can make up a battery
of six-inch guns to'look like a ﬂock
of sheep, and herd them into action
browsing. Or you can dispatch a
scouting party across No Man’s Land
dressed up as-pill-hoxcs, so that thc
deluded l-lnn, instead of opening ﬁre
with a machine gun, will merely post
letters in them—valuable letters. con~
mining military secrets. Lastly, and
more important still. you can disguise
yourself to look like nothing at all,
and in these days of intensiﬁed
nrtilicry fire it is very seldom that
nothing at all is hit. '

Poem from Spartanburg

It is not.

 

The wonder grows—What is the
liaskct Ball Manager doing up
Western Avenue at all hours of the
night? Pop Henson says Red is so
busy he is making his dates in the
early morn.

(mists at its recent meeting in
