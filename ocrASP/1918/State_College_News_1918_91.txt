PAY YOUR DEBT!

It is but seldom that State Cpl—
legc students are avS'L'L. to give
financial support for strictly col-
lege affairs, One of the few occa-
sions is at hand. On another page
the blanket tax collection is an-
nounced and explained.

Last year was the first attempt
and the success of the venture was
very decided. There was practi-
cally a 100 per cent response, and
the treasurer was able to meet all
bills.

The response must and will be
equally as hearty this year. Ath-

‘ letics are needed and student pub-

lications must appear. The latter
are essential as moldch of opin—
ion, media for self expression,
means of announcements and rep—
resentatives of State College in the
inter—collegiate world.

The individual subscription sys-
tem is a failure; the blanket tax
system is .1 proved success. The
tax system is dependent upon a
100 per cent student support. it is
neither a matter of inclination nor
of mild duty, but of debt. Every
student receives a free college edu-
cation of the highest type and en-
joys all the privileges of college
life. For the latter there must be
some small fee. $5.00 is a small
fee for the privileges it brings.

Students. “ Tcnshun 2" You
have a debt of $5.00. Your chance.
to pay is at hand next Tuesday.
Show your colors. Will they he
trnc blue or yellow? It is a case
of “Eventually, why not now?"

THE DOOR MUST

Since Plato wrote his ” Rc nb-.

lic;” since Aristotle gathered want
him his little band of followers,
the freedom of the individual has
depended largely upon the main—
tenance of freedom in thought.
The early Attic schools of philoso—

phy were he precursors of the
'modcrn'collcge which today stands

THE COLLEGE MAN
AND THE S. A. T. C.

With the opening of colleges for
another year the man of college
age is again confronted with the
problem of what he shall do.
While the possibility of enlistment
is not open to him, the probability
that he will be drafted is great.
"hits he is uncertain as to how to
act.

State College, in accepting the
proposal of the War Department
to establish hch a branch of the
Student Army Training Corps, of—
fers to the prospective Freshman,
or to the returning upperclzissnian,
a solution of the problem which is
facing him. By the terms which
the Government offers. as fully
explained by the President in last
week’s News, the young man of
draft age may seek voluntary iii-
diiciion into the S. A. T. C., and if
accepted may become a soldier of
the United States, receiving the
pay. privileges, care and dniies of
a private. But he is allowed to re-
main in college until the Govcrin
mcnt needs him in another field.

By this means a man may be
gaining his necessary education
and still be training, under compc<
tcnt directors, to lill his individual
place in the scheme of defeating
the Hun.

in the face of the above briefly—
mcntioncd facts. thcrc isbnt one
course for the young civilian to
take. He should enter college,
faithfully perform his duties here.
and accept his glorious opportu-
nity for service. The need is
great. the opportunity is at hand,
and the men must and will re-
spond.

Every State College man in the
S. A T. C.!

STATE COLLEGE NEWS, September 26, 1918.

C. A. and K. of C. in camps. ,Ev-
cry one has lieiird tlic‘story of the
frequently displayed sign, “ Have
you written to mother?” and near-
ly every one knows the splendid
result. '

Certainly, this is one lesson of
the war for the college student.
Too often does the letter to the
home folks become a
homcsick Freshman days. Too
()flcll'tbe increase of work and
pleasures causes one to neglect to
writc,~perhaps to forget to do so.
But them: at home do not forget.
They still are making sacrifices
that the boy may have an educa-
tion. Greater ones are made each
day. Can they not have a letter
at least once a week.

Will not each college student
place conspicuously in his mental
landscape the sign of the service
camp, ” Have you written to
mother?"

Student Tax $5.00.
