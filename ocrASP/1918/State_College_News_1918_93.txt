POPULAR SONG .

If you don’t like beans and hard-

ac , .
If you don’t like your slumgullion
stew,
No matter what you eat, the table's
always neat, .
There’s no kick a-comiug from you;
If you don‘t like yourtliirty monthly,
If you're sore at your new attendant,

too,
Just remember, my boy, it’s not
lllﬂllllnii,
It’s your Uncle Sam that‘s feeding
you.
From “ The Bayonet,"
Camp Lee, Virginia.

Positive knowledge have I none,

But my aunt's washerwnman’s sister‘s
son,

Board a policeman on his beat

Say to a laborer on Sycamore street,

That he had a letter just last week

Written in the finest Greek,

From a Chinese Cooley in Timbuctoo,

Who said the. negroes in Cuba knew

Of a colored man iii 5'. Texas town,

Who got it straight from a circus
clown,

That a man in Klondike heard the

1 ws
From a gang of South American
Jews.

About somebody in Borneo,

Who heard a man who claimed to
know,

Of a swell society female fake,

\h’liosc mother-iii-law would tinder-

take
To prove that her husband's sister’s

niece

Had stated in a printed piece,

That she had a son, who had a
friend, ‘

Who knew just when this war Will
end—Exchange.
