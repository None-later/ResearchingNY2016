A recent issue of one of Albany‘s
daily papers printer! a sarcastic
editorial comment entitled “Aw
thor Factories," The object of the
paragraph was to ridicule one of
the courses offered this year, for
the ﬁrst time, at Columbia Univer-
sity. This course is meant to train
students of the English department

 

in the “art of ﬁction or noch writ-
ing.” ‘Our contemporary feels that
this is an idiotic course. The edi—
tor insists that the public is too
much lluodcd with "fiction" and
“novels,” and he scathineg re-
marks that a college should retain
from attempting to produce even
one more author to pour out ad-
ditional gush of this type.

A TRIBUTE

 

it was with genuine sorrow that
we read in the lirst issue of the
" News" of the continued ill health
and resulting absence from college
of Dr. Arthur (2. Want To such
students whose rare good fortune
it was to have come into daily con-
tact with him there is a distinct
sense of loss, To work for him
was a constant. pleasure. His
courses were not limited to the
material contained within the cov-
crs of Illt' bunks used. 'l‘hcy were
educative in the re sense of
the word. The}! were a constant
tlppelll to intensive aml extensive
alndy. llis kindlincss and cllthtlsi~
asiu were infectious, One could
not remain long in his presence
and be indifferent In the inspiration
of his personality, We feel that we
have lost touch for a little while
With a very near and true friend,
it is our sincere hope that he is
well on the road toward a spci‘dy
and complete recovery of his
health.

RAYMOND T. CLAPP

 

it is with deep regret that
the “ News " announces the
death of Private Raymond
T. Clapp. a former student
of State College, at the Base
Hospital at Camp Devens,
on Tuesday, Sept. 24th. The
funeral was held at: the home
of his parents in Greenﬁeld,
Mass. Sept. 26th. The de-
ceased was just 25 years old
at the time of his death.

Private Clapp lived in Me-
chanicville for many years.
While there he attended and
was graduated from the Me-
chanicville High School. He
spent four years in Hamil-
ton College and later two
years at the University of
Grenoble, France. He was
a special student at State
College, working for a Pd.M.
degree, when he enlisted in
the army. Before entering
State College Private Clapp
taught for two years in the
Mercerburg‘ Academy, The
Hill School. v

The “News” extends its
sincerest sympathies to Pri-
vate Clapp's parents, Mr. and
Mrs. Walter Clapp, in their
very sad bereavement.

 

 

 

“'l‘hat burglar insulted me."
" How?"

"He demanded my money or
{1...
u I."

"All I. had with me was sixty
cents and he took that in prc‘fer-

 

encc to my life."
