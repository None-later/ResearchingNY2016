Will Be Sent to Camps

Tire unit will begin training un-
der Captain C. L. Reid. Although
the men must live in the barracks,
they will be allowed to devote part
'of their dav to college work. The
students will gradually be sent in—
to active service, or transferred to
other camps, some leaving at the
end of three months, others after
six months, while others will
complete their college work.

On October 15 about 450 men
will he sent to the college by the
various draft boards. These rrren
will compose Section B of the Stu-
dent Army Training Corps, and
will receive vocational training,
which will ﬁt them for overseas ser-
vice in about three months.

The following lieutenants have
arrived to aid Captain C. L. Reid
in organizing the new rnn : First
Lieutenant C. R. Warner, and Sec-
ond Lieutenauts S. A. 'Knighten, F.
E. (iaehclein, E. F. iiannon and D.
Fortune.

Fraternity Activities Cease

Owing to the organization of the
Student Army Training Corps the
fraternity problem is facing the
colleges of the country. All fra<
ternin activities must cease and
houses must close, since the men
must live in the barracks. Tire
question before the fraternities is a
difficult one. There are two possi-
ble solutions, either a certain ner.
her of men under eighteen years
of age may be chosen by the fra-
ternities from Sophomore Class
each year in order that there may
be active chapters in each college
after the war, or the fraternities
may depend upon alumni to re—
build the chapters after the country
has returned to normal conditions.

e same problem faces the fra-
ternities of State College. and in all
probability they will follow the
plan of discontinuing all activities
for the period of the war.
