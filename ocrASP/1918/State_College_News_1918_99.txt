Formal Inauguration of the S. A. T. C. at State College.

 

Dr. Brubacber Addresses S. A. T. C.,

Tuesday, October lst .

“ in organizing the Student Army
Tlfrainiug Corps to-day we are joiu~
iug hands with four hundred sister
colleges from each of the forty~
eight states in a movement of large
signilicance. We are here and now
givingr sttrety for a victorious army.
We are here and now dedicating
the educational interests of Amer~
ion to public service. We are here
and now consccrating the youth
of the land to the intelligent and
efﬁcient prosecution of the war.
We are today serving notice on
the sinister forces of ant'ocracy
that the will of a free people has
decreed justice and mercy to the
oppressed nations of earth.

” i am particularly happy in wel~
coming you, our friends of the AL
hany Law School, who come to us
under the orders of the War De-
partment. Standing shoulder to
shoulder we propose to do the task
our country wants done,

” All of us present here are par~
ticipating in an epoch-making event.
The colleges of the country have
accepted the commission of the
War Department to prepare ofﬁ—
cers and experts of various kinds
for the army. Our entire eduea~
tional equipment, the country‘s cu-

tirc educational resources. are thus
placed at the disposal of the gov-
crumcnt, The work of the colleges
is modified to suit the demands of
the hour. Courses relating directly
to war work take the place of the
courses offered in times of peace
and give sure guarantees that the
army will have men trained in
those specialties which modern
warfare needs. The secrets oi
science and' the mysteries of me-
chanical skill unite to break the
power of that. ruthless and cruel
militavry machine that has so long
threatened the. well-being of hu—
manity the world over.
“Education has been classed hy
the War Department as an essen—
tial occupation. That the schools
and colleges are necessary to the
military success of the country is
to-day fully recognized. \Ve have
pride that State College can make
its contribution to the great cause
and that the Law School will now
share so handsomely in the contri—
bution. We have sent a very large
percentage of our boys to the
front. Of 155 registered when war
was declared, more than 100 are
with the colors. The Law School

STUDENT ASSEMBLY

 

Captain Swindlehurst Ad-
dresses Student Body

Dr. Brubacher was most fortunate
in securing a very interesting speaker
for Student Assembly Friday morn-
ing. Captain Swindlehurst, a native
Canadian, after having been intro-
duced by 'Dr. Bruhachcr, said: "It
gives me a great deal of pleasure to
be here this morning to tell you the
simple story of our work at the front.
It is really easier to light than to

talk.

“l. enlisted as a private in the Am-
bulance Corps, attached to the
stretcher bearers oi the Second Bri—
gade of the Royal Canadian Regi-
ment. This regiment is made up of
Americans who enlisted before the
United States entered the war, Even
the olliccrs are American, We were
sent to England and quarantined, but
two days later the quarantine was
lifted and we were rushed to France.
in France We were put in box cars
and Crowded so closely that we were
obliged to stand up all night. From
Baupaume we had to march up to the
town of Ypres. The salient of Yprcs
was shaped like a triangle—and there
is not an inch of that ground that is
not lilied with (lead.

“ Now the Ambulance Corps in the
Canadian Army works like this:
The t are in first line trenches four
dressin r stations. These are some-
times dugouts or Sandbag huts. The
Regimental Aid Posts have a surgeon
and a squat! of stretcher bearers.
Four trenches lead to the main dress—
ing station, and this leads to the
Casualty Clearing Station, from
which the men are sent to the
hospitals in France or England,
At the Casualty Clearing Station
are the Red Cross nurses, for this is
as near the front the women are al-
lowed to go. But they are by no
means out of/daugcr, because the
Red Cross is a target for the German
airmen. The Huns train their ma-
chine guns on the nurses if they are
near enough. A man wounded on the
front line is first given first~aid by
the stretcher bcarer, put' on a

  

,strctchcr, and rushed to the advance
