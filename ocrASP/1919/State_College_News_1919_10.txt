their efforts were highly success-

The orchestra, O’Neill's four-

SYRACUSE GAME T0 - NIGHT

Massachusetts Aggies Saturday Night

Syracuse University’s basketball
team will clash With the Purple
and Gold in the Albany High
School gymnasium on Thursday
night, the 20111. The game will be
called at 8-15 o’clock. Syracuse
has a well-balanced team, Barsha
and Martin are veterans, and Mar-
cus in center is a shifty player. In
their game with Union, which they
won, Marcus and the two guards
did all the heavy work for Syra-
cuse. Syracuse lost to Colgate, at

Hamilton, by two points, the last
week in January

Manager Lobdcll has secured a
game for Saturday night, the 22d,
with the Massachusetts Agricul—
tural College_ from Oreester,
Mass. This will be State’s second
meeting With the Aggies audit fast
game is expected. -We ended our
season last year with the Agricul-
tural College, winning by the score.
of 35-27.

HISTORY OF 1920

 

“l‘llttt‘t' up, ’20! Don't be blue
herause you're green. All Fresh—
men are alike." That's what ey
told us when We were lfi'esltitie11.
We believed then, but we know
better now: we have seen two
Freshman cl .05 since.

We made an excellent start by

 

electing Ernest Tripp president.
The Sophomores told us that

17'1't-slnnan nftiecrs should be chosen
for their looks, so we elected Jean
Ames Connors, Spencer Peckham,

 

l‘larglaret Gray and Albert Luff
for \’lt't‘.~])l'(‘Sl(l 11, secretary, 1reas~
lll'tfl' and reportr especlively.

 

The things we remember most
clearly about that year include
not the fact that we lost to the
Sophomores in the athletic contest
on Thanksgiving Day, but the
party we gave them because of it;
the basketball championship and
the indoor track meet that we won,
and the fact that we organized the,
first-class football team. We still
have memories of the class twins
of '20 on Freshman Friday, too.
and of our class dance. Then we
were “moved up” and became
Sophomores.

Good things are the ones that
continue to improve. Under the
"peppy" guidance of our Sopho»
more president, Marian Beale, we
gained a reputation for starting
things. \Ve bought two Liberty
bonds. We originated the class
sing and several new- songs to
make it interesting; than we pro—
duced two. champion basketball
teams, Some enterprising young-
sters from ’21 proceeded to steal
our banner, but we regained it m
a. ﬂag rush. Because we had won
that rush we let the Fresh have
the next one, on the night trefore
moving-11p day. That left us with
a free conscience to win the track

Slate won its fourth game of the
season when it met and defeated
Middlebnry in the Albany High
school gymnasium lard. Saturday
night by a score of 491.

Stati- started the scoring early,
l\lidd|ehury not being able to pass
the home team at any stage of the
game, the l‘nrple and Gold team
was never hard pressed. Slate's
forwards played a great game and
between then ' .counted for forty—
three points, each man scoring nine
times from the tield.

State's pass work was fast and
the men worked the hall down the
rourl in good shape, nearly all of
