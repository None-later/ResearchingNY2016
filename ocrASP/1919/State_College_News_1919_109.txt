Secretary llakcr who said:

students the great educational and

Secretary taker paid tribute to
“the glorious part player] by the
colleges of this country in the
recent struggle." He said that ” it
is to the collegiate institulions of
the nation tltat we must always
turn to sn‘wly the material front
which the rommissiont-d otlit‘er
personnel for our innuense citizen
armies must be developed. More
than fifty thousand of our Army
and Navy oftieers in this war were
drawn from one hundred and fifty
institutions of learning. And at
the early trainng camps for offi—
cers there was evident one very
striking face,— lhat the youinr men
who had come from schools and
colleges where military training
had previously prevailed were the
men who most. quickly amt readily
became available for active and
efficient service. With the hour
of battle only a few weeks distant,
the value of the training.r they had
already received while at college
was rtf immense importance. Mod-

ern warfare demands of its officer,

professional skill and a careful and
thorough grounding in the funda-
mental principles upon which to

probability always be those of citi—
zenry drawn to the colors when
the emergency arises, it follows
that the bulk of our ofﬁcers must

of discipline and the principles of
leadership. 'l‘his lrainintr aml ex-
perience it is believed can best be
secured through the military in-
struction which can be imparted in
the schools and colleges.”
Secretary linker declared that
“ it has not been in the past, nor is
it now, the idea or intention of the
Government in relinstitutintg a 5y5<
tem of military training for stu—
dents to develop a militaristic spirit
in our people. There is a wide gulf
between military proﬁciency as
typiﬁed by the American citizen
trained to arms and confident of
his proﬁciency and that militaristic
spirit which the l'rnssian system
developed during the past forty
years, It is our idea to develop in
the nation a citizenry trained and
capable of efficiently hearing arms
for the national defense. To train
and to lead this citizen army we

"The training of officers de~
