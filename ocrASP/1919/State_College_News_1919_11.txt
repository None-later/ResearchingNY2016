EDITORIALS
OUR JUNIORS

r

‘ The senior editors of each of the
'News” this week have turned the
publication of the paper over to
the Junior associates. This seems
a most llllllll‘; way to round out
Junlor week; Except for a couple
of editorials, this week's issue is
entirely lllc work of the juniors,
whose ability to carry the ” News "
through a victorious year next year
Is unquestionably displayed.

leewisc is it titling that some
tribute be paid to this jolly class.
The success of last week's events
needs no mention. They‘re capable
of speaking for themselves.

While looking through the copies
of the "News" issued during the
past two and one—half years, I
could but notice the number of
times 1920 figured in college life
during that period. \th seniors
are not to think that 'l‘) is, and
was, the banner class. And, with-
out changing this view. we must,
and do, acknowledge the splendid
qualities of '20. State College has
benefited immeasurably by the
spirit of ’20.

Evidences of this spirit are so
numerous that it is impossible to
list them. Chief among these is
good sportsmanship. The fresh—
men of the fall of 1916 were the
largest class that ever entered. State
College, but their clean sportsman-
ship made. the interclass rivalry
between '19 and ’20 a thing of de-
light and a credit to the Yellow
and White banner. And when ’19
was forced to stand aloof from the
freshman—sophomore scraps of last
year, the same spirit was manifest.
'20'5 class songs and yells showed
all the other classes "how to do
it "—«a ﬁne example of leadership
in the matter of class'spirit.

And ’20 has given much to her
Alma Mater. Men for the teams.
basketball and hockey, stars for
drainawtics. workers for publication
boards and strong supporters of
every branch of college activtty.

Anrl,,last but not least. the Yel-
low and White banner has served
its country. The number of ser-
vice stars on ‘20’s flag is a ﬁne
demonstration of her spirit
gold star shows that she has made
the supremesacriﬁce. '

And so onv-fad inﬁnltum. But
space prevents. Then, 1920, here's
go you] THE EDITOR.

 

STATE'COLLEGE NEWS, FEBRUARY 20,4919

DID YOU KNOW THIS?

Say folks, do you know who
prepares the lunches served in the
cafeteria? It’s the juniors oi the
Home Economics department. It
is they who are responsible for the
salads, soups and other dishes——
served so promptly at 11:30. They
work in squadcs of live or six—-
froth 9:00 until 1:00—ea-ch squad
with its supervisor, who plans out
the work for the rest of her hclp<
crs—and all working together,
prepare the lunch.

And do you know that these
same juniors do settlement work
in the city? Teachng cooking and
sewing to those whose opportuni-
ties arc limited; teaching with the
experience obtained as the only
remuneration.

if you don’t know these things
——wakc tlp—tllc juniors are some
class

THE AFTERMATH

Everyone's dead this week, that
is, the juniors. it’s been a lot of
hard work but indeed worth while.
How can we properly thank those
instructors who have been so leni-
cnt with 1920 int-miners this last
week end? And bowironld we
have had such a wonderful recep-
tion and prom without the cili—
cicucy of the different. crunmillccs,
and the invaluable aid of “122?
Everything went as smoothly as if
waxed. And perhaps best of all
we haven't heard a single adverse
criticism. We're wondering,r now if
those students on committees who
had to cut classes last Thursday
and Friday might not be excused?
We're juniors only once in four
years, and this year we didn't have
any rest between semesters to plan
social allairs. Have a heart!

 

A WELCOME CRITICISM

A large portion of space in the
"News" has been given over to
articles on collch spirit, advertis—
lug State, College and college func—
tions. Much of the criticism has
been destructive. A more pleasant
job is now in order. Junior wcck
cnd fulfilled our highest hopes. I:
measured up in every way. Never
did the gym look better, never was
the music quite so peppy, never
did things no as smoothly as they
did last week end. There was a
finish to the manner with which
the reception and l’rom were
handled that was a joy to all of
us. The most suceessful Student
Assembly of the year so for, if
you judge by the, college spirit
generated, was held Friday morn-
ing. We felt during Junior Week
End no necessity for an apologetic
attitude We were proud of State
College and of our abilitly to put
on a From which will long be rc~
membercd by the fortunate class
of l920.

We Juniors feel that fortune

. favored us last week end in many

ways. A rare treat was provided
in Student Assembly. A member
of the faculty not only sympathized
with our desire to have worth while
dances after the games, but actu-
ally put in working order a scheme
which will improve our dances and
entertatin our guests. We are glad
that the last Student Assembly
came during our Junior Week
End.

SELAH

There have been Proms and
Proms but never one like ours!
We mean it without any super-
fluous, egotistical pride. too. We

 

have all heard how loudly every-
one boasted about last year‘s Prom
(with the present seniors doing the
biggest share) but even thesa dig-
niﬁed superiors have toppled off
their lofty perches to congratulate
us upon our .l’roml And as for the
sopbs who attended—well, they
are still going around with their
mouths wide open from amaze-
ment. The committee deserves all
the credit it received and more, too,
because it was their nntirlng efforts
that has made ’20'5 Prom a real
State College tradition. What
cla55 will dare fall below the stand-
ard set by the class of 1920 when
it Collies to Proms? Surely not our
arch enemy 1921, and again in
turn their sworn enemies 1922 and
so on 1923, 1924 (doesn't that
sound funny? lint then 1920
sounded funny when We were
freshics but it doesn’t now because
it means a great deal to us).

To those who were tumble to
go to the From we extend our
sympathy. Eslecially to those
who were uuab c to get men. it
is a safe bet that quite a few who
planned on this; junior event and
were "slipped up " at: the last mo-
ment shed more than one tear as
they packed away the shimmery
satin and tulle that were deprived
of making; their debut.

We have reached the climax of
our cullch life, and now we are
looking; forward to the next great
event, our graduation, toward
which we must plod and plug
through nmuutaius of methods
and practice teaching. Sclaltl

AFTER THE BALL

Silence over the ballroom settles
Robbed of its soul of tone.

Low lights fall on flower petals
’l‘ramplcd and careless strown.
l‘alms bend over the waxcn iloor
With an almost orient ornate:
Bringing thoughts of an hour be-

fore ——
Of silks and silver lace,
The glint of light on jeweled
rings,
.c: is of the tint of gossamer
wings, .
Measures of music, rhythmical,
Keeping time to the rise and

fa l
Of fluttering.r dresses, and dancing

cc ,

And smiles, and laughter—Jove
complete;

'l'oo real for a memory, unless——
One by one the lights go out;

Night winds breathe, and all about
Dark shades fall

Embracing: all
in vast forgetfulness.
