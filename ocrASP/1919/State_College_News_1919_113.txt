I’rulesscir Ix‘isley then addressed
the students on heltall' of the Stu-
dent Hoard of Finance. III: dis—

the “News.” As Mr. Ix’isley later
on revealed his IItttIIII of reading
avidly the contents of this "t‘t‘ltlill‘li-
ahle" paper, it is strange that he.
missed such an iinpnrtaiit iteiu. III
discussing the hudnet for this year,
.Ir. lx‘isley spoke of the mistaken
heIieI on the part of several stu-
dents concerning the existence of
a large sum of tax money. “ IIII eI ,"
he said, “ uo stieh eoiiIlitinii ex z"
()n the other hand, there is It (le 'it
of some, two hundred dnllars, but
there remains after the payment id

Honda. \Ve wonder why this
amount. and more, was invested
in this way? (It itnnrse i|
was the patriotir thing," to do. and
quite the reverse now to have In
ezuivert the hoiids iiitn eash. Yet
the stttdettts paid in this money for
student use, not as an investment
