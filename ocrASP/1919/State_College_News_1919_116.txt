EDUCATION AND DELA-
WARE

 

 

 

 

liown in Delaware scvcu thou-
sand farmers have pctitioncd Gov.
John G. Townsend. and a thousand
have invaded Dover, in an cl'fort to
intimidate the Supreme (fourt. The
object is to have repealed—or (ch
t‘larcd unconstitutional -—2t law which
they say is “revolutionary" and
“ violates the Constitution by intcrt
ferinr,r with their personal rights.”

This law is the “New School
Code." which was I. d by the
Legislature : lcr investigation by Dr.
Abraham lTlcxncr and Dr. lirank P.
Bachman. both of tlu- (it‘lll'l‘ill
Education lloard of New York. had
found that the schools wcrt- run as
miscrly as possible. the teachers un-
trained and attendance compulsory
only from three to live mouths of
the year.

There are four reasons why
Delaware farmers want the new
school law repealed. liirst. it will
cause an increase in their taxes;
second. it will take the children
away from farm work for eight
months and, "if they read about
them big cities. they'll want to go
thch and therc'll be no holding
thent'," third, since there are few
competent teachers in Delaware,
their children will be subject to
” foreign " influence: and fourth. it
will cause the sacrilctzc of tearing
down tlte antiquated frame scltool~
houses of their great grandfathers.

Judging.r from the above reason-
