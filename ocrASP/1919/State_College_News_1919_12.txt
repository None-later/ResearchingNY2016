SPANISH CLUB

 

We tried a new scheme at our
last meeting of the Spanish ffluhon
February 13. We had a real Span-
ish meeting in which hardly a word
of English was spoken. First we
tried playing an adapted form of
"Bird, beast, and fish." That
didn't uecrssita-te very much talk-
ing on the part of the members
but it certainly was grind practice
for the one who attempted to lead
the meeting to explain the games
in Spanish. it is hoped that this
first attempt will be an incentive to
further efforts mi the part of our
tnemln-rs, in really using the Spati-
ish language in lllt‘ few opportuni~
lies that are given us.

The latter part of the meeting
was given over to Prof, Stinard
who showed us some stereopticnn
views of Cuba and spoke to us in
Spanish about his experiences on
the island. \Ve enjoyed it a lot
and we hope to have more ta-iks
like this in the future.

Do you know, girls, that we have
a mighty loyal supporter in Prof.
Stinartl? lie is very anxious to
make the club just as profitatbie to
us as it can possibly be made.
Let’s back him up, girls, and show
him that we can have a real Span-
ish club. in which every member
(lees her part, not just by respond-
ing when she is asked to help out,
but by coming forward with any
suggestions, no matter how simple,
that might serve to make our
meetings more interesting or more
profitable.

 

JUNIOR RECEPTION
(Continued from page 1)

music, leave it to Tom O’Neill. He
even had Charles, the invulucranble.
fox-trotting 'round instead of walk-
ing in his usual military stylel To
refresh the thirsty dancers, there
were two huge bowls of ice cold
punch at each end of the room.
And everyone imbibed freely, for
it was a sample of Bertha West’s
skill in that line.

Among those in the Faculty re—
ceiving line were Dean Homer and
Mrs. l‘foruer, Dean Anna E. Pierce,
Professor Bronson. Professor

York, Mrs. York, and Harriet Ris-
ing. president of the class.
