feeding,r all the Republican political
news from headquarters to the pub-
lic which it will swallow.

.-\nd that has been no simple task,
it has required pioneer work, for
heretofore there has been no regte
iar director of publicity. The public,
always a psychological problem, has
demanded education as well as in-
formation along political lines. We-
men, the new element of the elector—
ate. have needed political food very
different from that dealt out to men
readers. Mr. Franklin, however, has
turned the trick. He is going to tell

the Press Club how he (lid it. He
will talk for a half hour, and what
he has to say will be worth while.

Notice of the room will be posted.
Watch the bulletin board.
