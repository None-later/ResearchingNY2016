CONGRATULATIONS

We should like to take this op-
portunity of congratulating thi-
people who have Cflllll'lltlllt'll st '1
splendid posters for the bulb
boards. .\'ot only ilo those posters
add a cheerful note to our hulls,
but they claim the attention of
cr your. 'l‘hcrc is only one thing
lackini,r in most of tltcsc posters.
and that is the initials of the artist.
We should liki: to be able to tell
these artists how much we appre—
cialc their work. lly thi- way, who
math that clever poster for the
Thanksgiving' Dance? If that
doesn't attract people to tlu- dance.
What will? It is one of the biggest
“drawing cards" of the dance, for
surely. no one can look at that:
poster without knowing,r he is goingr
to have the time of his lift: at that
affair. \Vc think that the people
who do such praiscworthy work
for our llllllt’lill hoards ought to
sign their names. or at lcast their
initials. iii a conspicions place so
that due credit may be given them.

\Vc also think that congratula—
tions are iti order for the Milne
High orchestra. \\’c had ample
proof last Thursday evenini.r of
tht-ir talent and ” pep." Everyone

evidenced by the fact that most
