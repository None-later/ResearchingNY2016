Mr. Chtunpliu. State Librarian.

in the State Education liuiltliug.
He explained the location antl use
of each. and asked those who use
the libraries to be careful of hooks.
and to avoid “concert” work tltcre
for the sake of others. While stuv
dents are always welcome at the
Education Building, the observance
of these rules would help create
better tcztlnowtnk between State
