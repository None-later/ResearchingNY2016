THE FIRST TIME

in last week's “News” a blank

‘half—colmnn appeared on the fourth

page with an explanation preced-
ing it.

Assignments ware given out for
write-ups calculated to more than fill
the paper. These write-ups were so
brief that the blank space was the
inevitable result. There surely was
material enough in the activities of
the Convention alone to more than
fill our four pages, but some of the
members of the " News " board
though-t vacation extended over
some six days or so. The board of
managers declines to hold itself re-
sponsible at any time for such results
when the cause is in other hands.
We should here and now like to
thank those who did do their write-
ups completely, Criticism of blank
space is serious. but we want the
student body to know the actual
cause. As was explained last week
we had “Smiles” enough to fill that
space, but the results of publishing
those the week before caused us to
make more rigid our censorship.

 

A NEW ONE

What are our chances for a new
mail box outside the " News ” office?
The present one is overwhelmingly
inadequate, especially at this time of
year when the presence of billet doux
seems prevalent. Why couldn't a
regular set of pigeonholcs, alphabet-
ically tabulated, be fitted into One of
those window spaces of the publica-
tion ofﬁce?

In. the present mad scramble for
mail some is lost, some mutilated and
some just disappears. Just an ordi-
nary wooden framc with twenty-six
spaces ought to be easy to secure and

establish, with a live class in car-

pentry. Maybe someone would like
the job of playing postmaster. This
could be managed thr‘u one of the
aforesaid windows and perhaps
stamps might be sold there also—a
fully recognized need. What do you
think-of the new idea? Iset‘s,2l10ear

“ eo-opennrron "

,We frankly admit that the above
title was stolen. We found it first
on a neat lit-tie sign in the locker
room, urging every man to help
build the hockey rink. Soon after
we heard it used in a short talk re-
garding that same rink, it wasn't
long before the boards inclesing our
prospective ice pond were all nailed
in place, and We decided that "co-
operation" is a good .Wnrd.

Working together can accomplish
things, but any other kind of work
means wasted energy, What chance
would our basketball team have nl
winning any games if each man;
tried to carry the ball up the llour ‘
without passing it to his teamd
mates? Or what rltaure would a
football team have without concerted .
action

We hear a lot of e '
the "Quarterly." Cr . is :1!
right. (loud comumu-. use, picking—
to«pieces, examining, and judging as
to the" merit of things is always val—
nable. in! this particular kind of
criticism that is used in regard to
our College paper can hardly be
classed as valuable. For ‘ustancenve
have heard several people say, ” What
good is the ‘Quztrterly'? never
read it," What can you call an atti-
tude like that but just plain mule-
ishness? if. on the other hand, these
pcrsous'would read that papcr, com-
pare it with the papers of other col-
lcgcs. decide what they did and did
not like about it. and report to the
“Quarterly” ioal'd. that would be
" ctr—operation."

Next Ifriday night there will he a
big indoor athletic meet in the Ar-
mory. Syracuse, Colgate, Union.
R. l’. l., Hobart, and State College
will have representatives. if we
could get a State College section and
give some good old-time cheers for
our men. what sort of an impression
do you think we would make on the
men from these other colleges and on
the people of Albany? But we have
a basketball game with Clarksnn that
same night. How can we be in both
places? Where is the “co-opera-

   
     

"i~nt about

These are not the only examples
of lack of team work. Examples
are furnished every day. Of course
we are not wholly bad, but bad
enough. We are only a small col-
lege, but if every department. every
class, every club, every fraternity
aml sorority, every publication, and
every student would "co—operate"
with the others for the good of the
College. we could make ourselves
known from one end of the State
to the other. '21.

WHERE WERE THE MEN?

Where was the Minstrel Show so
widely advertised for Saturday night
at the Bazaar? Many persons in—
quired about it, and what answer’
could we give? “They got cold
feet!” Boys. we thought you were
braver than that. The girls have. it
“all over" you when it comes right
down to business. Where was the
pop-corn machine? If we had
waited for the men to decorate the
gym the Bazaar would never have
Iaken place. Credit must be given
where it is due, and we must " hand
it" to the girls for the success they
accomplished alone.

A Y. W. Member.

To the Editor of the " News ":
in your issue of November 26, you
published sortie three columns of ma-

- tcrial entitled “Smiles.” Very likely v

you have heard the diverse criticism
thus‘ aroused. For my own part I
enjoyed them thoroughly, but a good
many classmates and quite a few.
faculty members have looked at them ‘

in an altogether different light, and
are almost, you might say, disgusted.

.linmor says that these okes were

copied entirely front pub icntions of
other cu-ed. institutions. it this be
true it is easily understood how they
ware allowed to be published in the

News.’

Hut, you know, State College. is
not comparable to other institutions
in its attitude towards such attempts
at fun, and so this letter is an at-
tempt to advise a stricter censorshii
of future " Smiles “ items. As I nah.
i enjoyed them myself but have ae-
quircd a set-tirineg depraved taste in
so announcing the fact. Let's have
jokes, Mr. liditnt‘, but go easy on
that “rough stuff" at) publir, ob»
jcctiouablc to State Cullcge inmates.

NEWMAN CLUB

:\n .\luumi Assurinlitul of the
Newman Club was recently organ<
lzcd. .\lr. ih-yu being chosen presi-
dent. In order that the present Inclu-
hm.- of the Club may become better
acquainted with it, this association
has taken action at l)llL'(.' Monday,
November ﬁll at 4 :30 a special meet-
ing of the . ewman Club was called
in the auditorium. Miss l"ilzgcrald
spoke to those present cuneeruingthc
future plans of the alumni. She an
nounced that on January fl, 1920.
there is to he an in formal dance at
rthc Vincentian institute. This will
be an opportunity for the Newman-
itcs to meet the alumni. The tickets
are $1.50, Anyone who is not a mem—
ber of the Newman Club, but who
wishes to attend the dance may get
a bid by consulting any of the mom»
bcrs. The tickets are limited, Get
yours early.

The monthly meeting of the New-
num Club was held Monday, Decem-
hcr l, at 4 o’clock in the auditorium.
During the short business meeting, a
committee was appointed to consider
plans for the establishing of a bul-
letin board for the Club in the lower
ball. A pleasing feature of the en-
tertainment following the business
meeting was two solos, "Lead
Kindly Light ” and “Ave Maria," de-
lightfully rendered by Margaret
Markham, ’20. Father Dnnney then
gave a most interesting talk on the

 

"’Life of Cardinal Newman."

The second Quarterly Communion
was received by the Club at St. Pat-
rick's Church, Sunday, December 7.
An excellent breakfast was served by
the social committee and the. coun-
cilors in St. Patrick’s I-lall, after the
mass. There was a goodly number
of the members and alumni there.
We were most honored by having
the Rev. Father O’Connor, pastor of
St. Patrick's Church, breakfast with
us and speak to us so encouragingly.
Also were we pleased to be addressed
by Father Dunney and Mr. Dcyo.

. This Quarterly Communion was even

more successful than the ﬁrst, Keep
up the spirit.

REPLY TO UNION

State College, Albany,‘N. Y.
Dear Egg: ' ’ '
You said you're not feeling well.
Our dog’s been sick, too. You both
ate so much Tl‘llanksgiviug i don’t
see ltow you cotlld eat any more for
a week after. Now. Egg, 1 don't
want you to "cast any asparagus ”
at my fudge. Maybe if you'd left
some for somebody else it wouldn’t
havu affected you that way.
es, all the. girls at the College
were kidding me about "that fellow
with the spots.” One of the fellows.
down here must luwc seen you, too.
for he said:

"Gee, when a fellow wears his hair
parted in the middle. that ain't so
bad, but when his hair is parted and
he wears spats, too, oh boy!”
guess they’re all crazy about yntl,
Egg. every one of ’cm, but you luVL'
me. don't you? There, I'm getting
serious! No, they won't follow your
style, ligric: lln-y’re real nice fellows
down here. ‘ _

Speaking against my handwriting.
why don't you tell al the other girls
to put their names on the outside
and then you won't be disappointed.

u always know yours and says to
me when i come in, “ llcre’s u lttllcl‘
from your stickin’ plaster."

Oh, gosh, ligg! I think you‘re an
awful goop. i guess you found out
all right by now that the Dean didn't
want you to eat with him. I guess
you had to explain to him that you
ain’t been feeling well. i guess he
says you’d better hurry up and get
some interest in your work. Huh?
We women have lots more perspicu-
ity than you men. The Dean asked
ill(' to call on him, too, but: i knrw
what he wanted, He just told me
how line l was getting along. You
b‘cttcr'd ask him to the Mohawk,
. y r

 

New, Egg, i just been wondering
about that Soiree. It's from 9:30 to
3 :30, ain’t it? And l’m going to save
you some money, cause ['11) going to
stay with my .'\unt over night so as
f'll be ableto sec Static beat Union
Saturday night. Our coach says
we’re going to win. It’s kinda tough
for you to have to lose the ﬁrstgamc
you play with us but-it makes it
easier when you know it’s my col-
lege, You said you'd give me any~
thing.
, Well, Egg, i got to iron a middy
blouse for gym. He uses an awful
lot of 'cm. f'll only be able to write
once a week cause Ma says she don't
want anything serious and it costs
too much for stamps. You'll write
twice as usual tho. won’t you?
[Yours till Dick asks Inc to marry
rm,

Rose.
P. S.—— Sorry, but all that "Save
the Baby" Ma used on the dog.
You’d probably need something
stronger anyhow. Pa swipes it at
the store and the boss has been there
regular. 'anasou in!“

MILNE HIGH
SCHOOL DANCE

A very pleasant informal dance
was given in the gymnasium by Quin-
tilian and Sigma, Milne High School

number from college attended.

Decorations consisted of high
school sorority and fraternity ban—
ners, State College banners, Christ-
mas hangings, and colored lights.
Reynolds' Jazz Orchestra furnished
the music—a pleasing variety of
One Steps, Waltzes and Fox Trots.
There were eight dances in each half.
During intermission and throughout
the evening punch and wafers were
served. Patrouesses were: Mrs. ‘J.
M, Sayles, Mrs. M, J. Le Comptc,
Mrs. A. H. Kirtland. Mrs. H. E. Hill,
