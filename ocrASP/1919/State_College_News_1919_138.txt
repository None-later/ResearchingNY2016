ILLUSTRATED LECTURE

Germany. Mr. Alexander showed
many slides. made from photo-
graphs. most of which be snapped
himself while on the trip. hcsc
slides, with Mr. Alexander’s ac—
companying talks, nortrayed the
various phases of work done in the
different schools of Munich. He
said that ﬁfty—four different trades
were being taught in these schools,
In fact the men of every trade had
the opportunity to attend a con-
tinuation school. in which they
could make themselves better citi-
zens and more efficient workmen.

 

ATTENDS CONVENTION
Continued from page 1
that the columns in all college
papers will be of the same width.
In this way all colleges will charge
the same rates for advertising
space, thereby increasing the num-
er of advertisers. Mr. Gorham
said that last year the G. E. Com-
pany had to make ten different
plates for the 200 college publica-

 

tions through which it advertised.
’ his year it has one sized plate
for 900 )npers. Mr. (lorhant and
Mr. Little are working to get the
big advertisers interested in un-
dergraduatc publications. llt'CiltlEit!
the greater number interested. the
greater the benefit to both parties.

Some very interesting sugges—
tions were made by. the various
delegates in regard to the methods
employed by the different colleges.
For instance, in lltlrvartl, four
lirosh are permitted to try out inl‘
business manager of the “ Harvard
Crimson." They have to work for;
three years getting “ads.” and
only (me man is finally chosen at
the end of the Junior year. The
colltlleliliou is so keen and ex-
citing that the l’rosh prarlit‘ally
fall over one another in their en-
deavor to get “it! s," “ 'l‘he ltoeh-
L‘ster Campus" (ix‘oebester Univer-
sity) has a circulation o Still.
the alumni of that college
agitated the project of starting a
paper of their own the “ tinnitus"
editors persuaded the alumni to
join forces with them. The propo-
sition proved snii‘factory and to-
day the alumni have a page in the
" Campus.”

Another worthy project started
at the lx'orhester L'niversity is an
honorary journalistic fraternity,
After a person has served two
years or more on any of their col-
lege publications be is eligible for
member‘hip in this frnl, and he
receives a ltey in recognition of the
honor. 'l'he Rochester University
is aiming to make this frat national.
so that to be a member of a stu~
dent publication board will be
something really worth Working

the demand in the eastern part of
the. Suite for training,r along industrial
lines does not seem to be great. and
so the State is not justified in main-
taining a department here for such
training.

If this bill is passed by the Legis-
lature. and there is little doubt but
that it will be, it means that all the
equipment of the industrial Depart-
ment will be transferred sometime
before September, and that the Col-
lege loses about twenty per cent of
its men. Whatever work is done
along industrial lines will be by lec-
ture and observation courses in con-
nection with a regular four-year
schedule.
