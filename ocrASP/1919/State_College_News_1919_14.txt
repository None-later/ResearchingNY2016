PROFESSOR KIRTLAND
ADDRESSES STUDENT
ASSEMBLY

 

The entire hour of Student As~
semhly on Friday, 7m. 2], was
given up to Professor Kirtlaud, ‘
who spoke on the League of Na-
tions.

lie began by telling,r of the com-
plexity of causes in all cases, and ‘
he used for an example the act of
getting water from the spout of a
well, showing the cmnplexitics that
made it possible. He applied this
to the causes of the \Var. which
were of two kinds, causes of condi-
tion and dynamic causes.

The principal causes of condi—
tiou were: the meat armaments,
the centralization of government,
and the inlerminulinrz of peoples.
The dynamic causes were the Aus—
trian control of Sci-via, poison ofl
suspicion, money lust, war lust.
trouble over Alsace~Lorraine, and.
the murder of an heir to the Aus- l
trian throne. To be free from war 
we must he free from causes. ‘
Many of those causes still exist. as,
for instance, suspicion, money lust,

LECTURES ON
UUKAPH Y

Professor Kirtland Discusses Com-
posrtlon in Picture-Taking

FIRST OF
PHOT

On Monday afternoon in the
auditorium, tel). .54, l‘rol'essor it.
ll. .[xirtland gave a very inlercst-
mg lecture, touching on the general
points to consider in taking,r a well-
hala-nccd picture. Accompanying
the discussion lantern slides were
shown to illustrate the salient
points.

This lecture was the lirst of a

series to be givun by Professor
lurtlzmd, The second will occur on
Monday afternoon, Mar. 3, at 4:45
1’. ‘M. The subject will be “Devc —
oping and Printing." l’rolessor
Kirtland i: an authority on this
SlllJJCCl, and will demonstrate his
methods.
. Concerning composition, Pio—
lessor .lx'irtlaud said that in order
to insure that the picture be per-
manently pleasing, one should take
care in the choice of subject. Pic-
tures haphazardly snapped of one's
iriemls, or of some casual scene,
will soon lose signiﬁcance. To
make a picture lasting in quality,
one should choose scenes whose
light, shade, masses, etc., are
adapted to picture making. A lit—
tle experimenting will make one
capable of includingr in the picture
only the desired portion of the
scene, In case any unnecessary el-
ements creep in. they may be elimi-
nated by blocking out in the print~
in;r process. The slides shown
were taken from pictures which
Professor Kirtlavnd took himself.
and were charming examples of
artistic photographic principles.
