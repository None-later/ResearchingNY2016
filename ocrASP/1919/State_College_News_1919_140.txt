MISS MANNER GIVES
LAST READING

   

 

 

 

The members of the senior class
of State College were invited to
attend the last reading in the series
given by Miss Jane Manner, Satur-
day evening at 8:. The pro-
grant was made up of three one—
act plays, Leon Kobrin's “The
Secret of Life," Percival VVildc’s
“ The Finger of God,” and F.
Frankfort Moore's “Kitty Clive."
The three plays are in ctttit‘cly dif-
ferent moods, the first being a sym—
bolic representation of the strife
between head and heart: the. second
a tense, episodic portrayal of a
man's self—mastery. and the third
a delightful farcical comedy.

MEMBER OF ASSOCIATED
PRESS TALKS TO PRESS
CLUB

Russel l'lathaway, manager of‘
the Associated Press in Albany,
gave an interesting talk before the
members of the Press Club last
Monday. llis topic was “What the
Associated Press 15;” explaining
the methods and uses of the Prices.
Mr. Hathaway traced the develop-
ment of news getting from the day
when the news was brought from
the incoming shipsto the coffee
houses to the extensive system of
the preseut'times. The ﬁrst Ameri-
can news getter was Topliﬁe, who
formed the plan of meeting the
ships in the harbor, thus obtaining
the news before the people at the
coffee houses. Later carrier
pigeons were used to transport
messages from Albany to New
York. The invention of the tele-
graph greatly facilitated the trans-
er 0 news. To avoid the indi-
vidual expense of telegraph rates
six New York publishers formed
an association, from Which de~
veloped the present Associated
Press.

The Associated Press now has
a membership of 1,228 publishers,
through whom the news of every
section of the country is covered.
Mr. Hathaway gave several clever
illustrations proving how perfectly
i fr'ce from bias and accurate in news
getting the Associated Press is.
