UNDERCLASSMEN,
ATTENTION!

The following editorial is copied
verbatim from the December 2
issue of the " l-lamilton Life.” We
are glad to discover such . senti-
ment prevailing in another institu-
tion than our own. While it may
not be completely applicable to us
its general trend of thought is an
expression we feel to be local.

“ Whether or not college customs
shall live on depends to a great ex~
tent on the attitude of the two
lower classes toward them. Per-
haps this cry or plea is too often
repeated, but nevertheless it is al-
ways applicahlc it seems, this fall.

Freshmen. you are not remem-
boring that Hello. Don’t forget
you are to be the first to speak and
the louder, the better. Sopho—
mores. do not make the attitude of
‘Mightier than God,’ so prevalent
in every sophomore class, unbear-
able. Your duty in college is com
structive and not destructive. Your
work is the furtherance of upper-
classman authority, which you are
next year to exercise. A policy
which is exactly contrary to college
customs cannot hope to live.

College life is not going In the
(logs, no matter how prevalent the
rumor among us may be. [t is
stronger and healthier this year
than ever before. Today is a time
for optimism and boosting. not of
eternal crabbing. Underclassmen.
your duty is a deﬁnite thing. it is
up to you to live up to your tasks.
With our increasing number, the
Hello and underclassmeu spirit is
of greater importance in keeping
the democratic nature of college
life of which we have so often
boasted than ever in the past."

 
   

The more you'loau the Govern-
ment, the less your taxes will be.
Ever think of that? Better' buy
Thrift and War Savings Stamps.

Dear Egg—1 guess i shan't say

nothing more about you and the
Dean for you two can’t
Only, Egg, don’t get put out of
college before the Banquet less you
introduce me to somebody else.
Don’t forget! Ain't it so, Egg?
Always when you're bright they
try to tell you you ain’t. l was
telling somebody how I got a blue
ribbon diploma from grammar
school (that ought to last me my
life) and then this person says.
“You ain't got nothing to brag of
in that." What do you think of
that.
\Vclls l'm kinda glad that girl
did as I told her. i wrote her and
says. “Don‘t bother with that
boiled Egg. He's awful hard."
’n‘ i mentioned that even if you
hadn’t asked me yet. l'd made up
my mind to marry you. You'll
Come to your senses soon.

Now. here it is Sunday night and
all the excitement of the Soirée is
over. i feel just like anybody
after a nightmare. i had a swell
time; i got a headache. and sore
feel and my hair net’s won’t last
half as long as usual this week. i
made some money, too, Friday
night. i was matching pennies with
that Dean fellow—not your
Dctlll~l1 E. I mean.

And what do you think? This is
terrible.» Egg. Some fresh fellow
by the name of "Jud " says to me,

agree. :

I was wondering if you had a sore
foot, but when you got nearer to
me I saw you was with 'Jel’f’ Bom-
bard." Ain‘t that awful? It’s an
ole joke but ain’t that mean of him
to make fun of him that way? I
think “Jeff’s” awful sweet and
dainty.

You know, Egg, I‘don‘t know
why our coach says we was going
to win, we didn’tl You know that
George Brucker? Well, he hadn’t
ought to have anybody else on a
team when he plays. He's an
awful hog. He keeps doing An-
nette Kollcrman dives and putting
the ball thru the basket all the time.
He don’t play fair, either. He
never gives the ball to S. C. men.
Not once did hcl I was a. swell
sport, tho, wasn’t I, Egg. I cheered
for him and then he never asked
me to dance.

Don't you think I've got swell
college spirit? Every girl that
wants a man for the Junior Prom
down here went to the game. Tint
most of the fellows were kinda
slow about asking ’cm to dance.
’l‘hey mustn’t be bashful. If you
pass by the faces Of S. C. T. girls
and look at their souls, they're :1
line lot of girls.

You was askng me what to give
your sister for Xmas. i'd suggest
a box of candy; i love candy.

Well, i gucss that's all now.

Yours for :1 while.
