ELASTICITY

One gleaming star of heaven,
From its place in the murky depths,
Shonc i'uddily on the scene.

The telephone kept ringing,

The door swung noiselessly,

The books began to jazz

To the time of limburgcr cheese.

The night was wild and woolly,

And the lights had all gone out,
The pickles stood in the jar,
The cat was wound and set.
The beds were yet iuimadc.
The curtains were not drawn,
The walls shrieked loudly anew,
And the dance waxed lustily.

“Oh, for a day in summer,”
Shrieked the mirror in the hall.

“Alas, alack, poor orick,"
Moancd the gas-jet at this ball.

All will soon be Over. ahl

, Never you fear, old tackhead.

Was this all an hallucination?
Yea ho, but not in vain,

For the little toads of the avenue
Came creeping out at the rain.

A Senior ﬂopped him over;
e snored a brand new tune.
And shadowy glimmers and glim-
mery wisps
Filled the erstwhile tidy room.
