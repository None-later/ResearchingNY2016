THE SIGNIFICANCE OF
THE CONFERENCE

“State College on the Map" has
been our desire since time im-
mcmorial. Of all things that have
helped to do this, the Student Vol-
unteer Conference of last week'has
done most, perhaps—certainly
much. Three hundred delegates
from other colleges,—Cornell,
Syracuse, Wells, Colgate, Hobart
and others—were guests of State
College, housed by College people,
fed at the College cafteria. and en-
tertaincd by the Students’ Associa-
tion at the basket ball game Sat-
urdayiiight after the evening ses-
sion of the convention.

Three hundred people have now
returned to their respective alma
maters after visiting State college.
The real signiﬁcance of their Visit
will come years later, perhaps,
but the .present signiﬁcance is great.
State College is in a position to
entertain a convention.

THE AGGIE GAME

A real treat to fans came Sat-
urday night at the game betwccn
State and Massachusetts Aggies.
For the ﬁrst time in our history
State had to play an extra term of
ﬁve minutes to decide the contest
above a sixteen-all score. A
more tense period is seldom seen.
It was a real case of stiﬁ ﬁght,
but Fitz’s foul and basket brought
the purple and gold score to nine—
teen, against cightccn as run up
by two fouls on the Aggie side.

Clean sportsmanship pays in the
end. State College glories. in the

rinciples of clean play eVidenced
by her men in last week's games.

THE PHOTOGRAPHY
LECTURES

 

I The announcement in last week's
“News” that Professor Kirtland
would' give' a' series of talks on
photography was read by all 'of his
devotees‘with great joy. To those
who have been so fortunate as to
listen to his delightful rambling pn
this pct subject of his, ‘thc promise
of more seemed a special treat.

lege, does not consist of classroom

 

 

 

STATE COLLEGE NEWS, FEBRUARY 27, 1919

lectures and study alone, but of
great advantage as the extra‘cur-
riculuni lectures, concerts and talks
which are held frequently in our
auditorium. Last year's superb
series of democracy lectures given
by our faculty, and'thc year's
series on the peace conferences are
splendid examples of cultural ad-
vantages.

To the Frcshmcii and those up:

pcrclassmen who do not know
Professor .Kirtlnnd intimately, we
wish to urge attendance at the.
Monday photography lectures. In
ndidtion to absolute material values
to be gained, those who go will
ﬁnd a distinct pleasure in the per-
sonal contact and informal rela-
tionship with Mr. Kirtland.

FRESHMEN, THIS MEANS
YOU!

Several weeks ago the “News”
published an editorial on the scum-
ing lack of respect shown by the
student body as a whole to the
speakers who address us in assem-
bly on Friday mornings. l—lowcvcr,
things may have improved siiicc
then in other parts of the audi-
torium. the Freshman section
seems to be growing noisier every
week. And to think, li‘rosh, that
before we were complimented be-
cause it was not our side of the
room from which the disturbance
came. Although we are so far
to one side that we cannot hear
how much talking the upperclass-
men do, certainly we are well
aware of our own faults. If the
other classes have shown a marked
improvement during the past few
weeks, surely we do not wish to
be so far behind them in the matter
of showing respect to the speakers
which favor us from week to week,
or in showing consideration for
others. And if those other classes,
who should be our teachers in all
such things, are no better than we
are, let us try to show them that,
evcii if we are "green," we have a
little common courtesy about us.
And so, regardless of whether the
rest need criticizing along these
lines, or not, let us try, this week
to show Professor Rislcy, and
everybody else, that we know how
to be polite.

THE RED CROSS

 

When the proposition was laid
before the Freshman class. that
we have a Red Cross unit in Col-
lege. there was a large number of
people who raised their hands. sig~
nifying that they would support it.
Well, there are just about a dozen
or pcrlia-ps fourteen of these peo-
ple who come out to the meetings
and help sew. That is a very small
representation of a class as large
as ours.

Perhaps many of us have the
idea that it will be a bore to come.
but instead, it is really a lot of fun.
We have not forgotten the adage,
“All work and no play makes Jack
.1 dull boy." and we play games
after our work is done.

You mav not know how to sew
well, but that doesn't make any
diﬁ‘crcncc. You can at least make
an attempt. and you will be sure to
ﬁnd a great many others in the
same predicament. Come on,
Freshmen. and help along the
movement which we have stagtzedl

 

 

 

 

 

MISSING

Three days, it seems, is a short
time in ighicliI big things might
happen. ig tiings (l. iappcn a
State College, beta. 2 , '2, 23.
We wonder how many “folks”
at College know about them, now
that their happening is past. We
can t‘cslily that many Statc Col"
lcgc girls came to ﬁnd out what
Was going on, over Washington’s
birthday.

We wonder, too, how many of
our faculty realize that there came
to us—to our own College herc,over
two hundred students, representing
eighteen different colleges through-
ou.t..New York State. We won—
der if even a small percentage of
our faculty consider that there
came, as well, many prominent

speaker; of this land and other

lands, some of them leaders of in-
stitutions throughout the world. .

Would it not seem strange to
these new people to ﬁnd an in.
stitution made up of students
alone? State College made an ini-
pression upon these earnest sisters
and brothers of ours—perhaps a
one-Sided impression. Many of
them had never heard that such a
place as State College existed. '

i‘hcy noticed and mentioned the
hospitality of one faculty member
who kindly opened the library for
their use. We wonder, with this
thought in mind, where others were
to give their hand of welcome.
These others were missed by no
small part of the two hundred
travelers who came to a new coun~
try for these days.

COLLEGE COURTESY

We’ve been terribly busy at Col-
loge this year~cvcry one of us. In
fact we've been so occupied with
work that we couldn’t even ﬁnd
time to talk to our friends as for~
merly. liut it does seem a shame
when we become so industrious
that we have no time for courtesy
—iiot the Sir \antcr Raleigh cour~
tesy, that would force the men to
lay their coats around the halls for
the girls to walk on, but just plain
thoughtfulness for others. It
doesn't take much more time to be
considerate and not only does it
create . a much more cheerful,
friendlier atmosphere but it also
names the standing of our college.

in the ﬁrst place there's our
cafeteria. Of course we often have
only half an hour for lunch and
there are a number of things to do
before one o’clock—and most of
all it’s so tiresome waiting in line.
Biit how many of us consider the
girl ahead? She may have even
less time than we have. and if she’s
at all meek or retiring she has
probably been pushed back at least
a dozen times. However, what do
we care? “Let's walk over her and
get up by Mary." Really, the cafe-
teria will soon be a ﬁne example
of the survival of the ﬁttest. It
seems that we would get through
the line just as quickly if we stood
in place—~or if we are unusually
hurried why not ask to be allowed
to step ahead. If We're polite
enough to ask, the other person
naturally couldn't be so rude as to
refuse.

Our library also seems to he a
scene of frequent forgotfuluess. Be-
cause it is the only place we have
to study, some of the student body
appear to consider it .1 recreation
room. It is very convenient to
discuss the lesson with the person
on the other side of the table, but
I ll‘llllk'mOSt of us realize how hard
it is to study with these discussions
in progress—unless we are one of
the participants. Occasional ques-
tions can be excused, but for the

 

lengthier conversation lct'S depart
to the hal .

Most oi all we need courtesy'nt
our games. There the public
watches, criticizes and judges us.
There the visiting team meets us,
notes our actions and reports them
when it returns to its home college.
The games are our udvcrtiscuiuiit
for State College, and we don’t
want, to be advertised as “rouglu
iiccks.” Above all things don’t let
us lower ourselves by clapping
when the opposing team fouls. Give
them that hand clapping in sports—
manlikc appreciation of good play-
ing. Due to our college spirit, we
certainly are overwhelmed with cx~
citcment at the games and then
when someone shoots a basket and
just misses everyone unconscious-
ly sighs and givcs forth a despair-
ing “ Oh.” but not trying to label
this act with the Discourtcsy Sign.
It isn't because we are at all dis—
gruntled or discouraged, we simply
forget ourselves. it must be rather
hard on the boys, though, to hear
the bleachers groan over'a lost
basket when six have already been
madc in ten minutes. Of course
they understand—but if we just
keep still or grin. there won’t be
the slightest doubt but that we're
back of them “for better or for
worse.” '21.
