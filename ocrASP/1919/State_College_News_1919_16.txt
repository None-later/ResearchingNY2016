jects of passing interest. He would
have them used every day as a
starting point from which to study
the subject at hand. They should

dent's interest, not merely in the
pictures themselves, but in ﬁnding
out more of the subject. They
should help the pupil organize his
material and should teach him ob-
servation if he is made to discover
everything he can find in them. Af-

the scoring for the Aggies by a
score from the foul line. l’arkhurst
showed he was there, too, by mak—
ing a neat shot from the field. The
Aggies were now in the lead. but
only for a minute, for Bowling
picked the ball from the air and
made the most sensational shot of
the evening, from the center of the
lield. State was now one point in
the lead, but Smith soon put the
Aggies ahead by making a ﬁeld
shot. Fitz. seeing a good chance
to get even, put the ball in the
ring from the foul line and tied
the seore—S~S.

Dowling soon came through with
another ﬁeld basket, and was a1-
nfost immediately followed by one
of Barry's nifty shots, which he
made after breaking up the oppo-
nents' pass-work in his usual
speedy manner.

McCarthy made a few more shots
from the foul line, Fitz ended up
the first half with a shot from the
foul line and made the score 10 to
S in State's favor.

Second Half

1n the second half Barry simply
picked the ball from his opponent's
hand and threw the ball through
the ring. McCarthy brought up the
Aggies’ score a few points. Then
Dowling made another sensational
basket from the jump ball. Park-
burst and Smith scored for the r\g~
gies again, and tied the score.

The score remained a tie for sev—
eral minutes. Curtin was there in
keeping the Aggies from scoring,
as he guarded the Aggies’ best
man.

Barry was everywhere. Again
and again he broke up the Aggies'
pass work, and suddenly he went
tip the floor and broke the tie.

The Aggies came in with two
more points and again the score
was a tie. And so ended the sec-
ond half, With a score of 16 to 16,
and both teams ﬁghting hard.

exist at present, they are liable to
conic buck.

World peace is desired. An at-
tempt to gain this is being made
by the formation of a League of
Aations, the program of which is
as follows: every nation shall send
delegates to meetings which shall
be held at stated intervals. There
shall be an executive council con-
sisting of the representatives of live
great allies and representatives of
four other states. There shall be
a Secretary General and a body of
his assistants, a permanent com-
mission to decide upon military
and naval questions, an interna-
tional bureau of labor, a court of
arbitration, and a permanent com»
mission to assist in the manage—
ment of colonies.

Professor Kirtland then read a
few of the most important of the
twenty-six articles of the consti-
tution and discussed them, show-
ing that they violated the Doctrine
of Washington, Monroe’s Doctrine,
the Constitution of the United
States, and the sovereignty of the
United States. He said that those
principles were usable when we
were an isolated nation, but now
that we have grown so much, they
do not apply“ We should practice
neighbor iness, and should think
of other countries besides America.
