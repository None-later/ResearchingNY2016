Couldn’t Faze Ethel

Etth had her quick wit working
that minute!

She was sitting with a gallant
captain in a charmingly decorated
recess. On her knee was a dimin-
utive niece, placed there pour ‘les
convena-nces, In the adiormng
room, with the dooropen, were the
rest of the company. Finally the
littlc‘hiecc was herd to say in a.
jealous and very audible voice:
“Auntie, kiss me, too."

“Certainly. dear," returned Ethel.
“But you should say twice, dear;
two is not grammar.”

Thoughts From a Favored Brain
(With Apologies)

When Pat's Inst paper is ﬁnished,

and the themes are marked and

(one,
When all the errors are red-inked
and the ponrest pupil has won,
I shall rest, and faith ,1 shall need
it, lie down for a month or two.
Till the Department down at Al-
bany shall put me to work anew.

Then I shall go to the movies, and
sit in a nice easy chair,

And see things that aren’t literary
and my brain won't have hard
wear,

And only the 'l’rinny shall praise
me, and only the Prinny shall

lune,

And no one shall work for honor
and no one shall work for fame,

But each for the joy of the money,
each in his separate school.

Shall teach the thing as hc sees it,
for an exam that is sure to fool.

SALE

Omicron Nu will hold a sale of
