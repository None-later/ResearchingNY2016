STUDENT ASSEMBLY

 

Faculty Entertains Students

After the customary singing of
Alma Mater last Friday morning,
everyone was pleasanlly surprised
by a delightful musical program
from the faculty.

Dr. Harold ’J‘lieinpsoii gave seve-
ral piano selections. We all know
what Dr. Thompson can do, and it
is needless to say that he wi eu—
eored heartily. Miss Card sang
very beautifully a “ Hindu Slumber
Song.” Masseuet's “Elegy” was
also sung in French, and her inter—
pretation of the language was
most perfect. Tllt‘ll eaiiie f’rofes-
sor Kirtlaiid. Everyone will ad-
mit that Stevenson’s ver '5
well rendered, both in vvr
song. "e wonder if
Ilirehenougli can solve
Ix'irtlaiid's problem?

it is to he regretted that, owing
to illiie ‘, neither Miss lleiiuett nor
Dr. Hastings were able to appear
in their respective places on the
program. Myskaruia will perhaps
plau another facility program in
the near future. and then we shall
no doubt have the pleasure of hear-
ing both.

Miss Marion l-leale, ’20, certainly
deserves credit for the manner in
which she encouraged everyone to
come to the plays Friday night.
She convinced its that she was cap-
able of taking all the parts of which
she told us.

The Senior class remained a few
minutes in assembly for an import-
ant class meeting.

The three plays given by the

February lsl. were enjoyed by a

students and visitors. The per-

about the family troubles, and very
