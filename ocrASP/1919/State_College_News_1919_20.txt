EDITORIALS
LOYALTY AND CRITI-
CISM

Of all things to be gained from
Professor Risley’s lecture of last
Friday morning, perhaps the most
helpful is the realization that we,
as individuals of a nation, still pos-
sess the right to criticise our lead—
ers. The audible gasp which tol-
lowed the spcakcr’s warning
against the allowance of too great
power to' the President of the
United States. was evidence of the
fact that wc are partisans. or that
we have not awakened to the fact
that war-is over and we are not
bound by blind devotion to the
principles of our leader. American
support of the administrative poli-
cies of the war was. no doubt. a
great factor in the victory. Loy-
alty MUST still be our attitude.
but unquestioning loyalty is not to
be demanded of anyone.

Not one of us has any fccling of
disloyalty. But, as Mr. Risley said,
our education gives us the right to
question, to discuss and to express
our just opinions. The fact that
Mr. Wilson has acted is not sufﬁ-
cient grounds for silent acceptance
of the act. To rank partisans this
will‘be rank heresy. But free edu-
cation shonld make non-partisans
of us. The analogy between Bis-
marck. “the honest(?) broker.” and
Wilson the mouldcr of European
opinion was startling, but was the
jolt wevnecdcd to wakcn us to a
realization of our rights of citizen-
ship.

Wc appreciate Professor Rislcy’s
emphasis on this point. and hope
that the spirit of the lecture will
grow.

NOT MISSING

In contrast to conditions noted
in an editorial contribution from
" sisters '19 and '21." published last
week. was the faculty action at the
Hamilton game. And back of this
is a faculty act worthy of high
commendation. Through the cf-
forts of Dean Homer a .petition
was circulated, asking for the reser-
vation of a men's section with the
State College “renters.” The direct

result was a solid section of State
College men on the north side

bleachers, whose lusty voices sup-

ported chccr leader McMahon m
yelling the purple and gold over the

But that is not all. With the men
of the college sat a delegation of
faculty men. headed by our Presi—
dent and our Dean. it is unfor-
tunate that these men could not
have heard the expressions of ap-
proval and delight which came
from the student body.

To.thosc students who are so
fortunate as to have consultations
with the faculty ollicials, the act
was not unexpected. They have
found the extremely human side of
these men already. But there are
hundreds of students who leave
State College without the knowl-
edge of the existence of this human
side. The men's “get-together"
of last year was a s lendid start to-
ward unity of lec'ng, And this
was instigated by the faculty. it
is to bc regretted that the move-
mcut was not kept up this your.

Faculty interest in student extra-
curricnlnm activities is awakening.
A full realization of “common
ground" for faculty and student
body will do more. perhaps, for
State (folk-go spirit than any other
thing. Now that interest is started.
let us stiumlatu it. Let us do our
ball, yes. our two-thirds. of the
part in trying to lind and keep the
common meeting ground of faculty
and student body.

TWO LETTERS OF
APPRECIATION
S. Ralph Harlow and W. Q. Swart
Write of Student Volunteer
Conference

 

President irubachcr has given
to the " News " for publication two
letters of appreciation of State Col—
lege’s hospitality duringr thc Stu-
dent Voluutcer Conference of last
week. The lctlcrs follow:

My Dear Dl'. Brubucller:

l want to thank you. both for the
State Union and for thyself, for the
kind hospitality which you cx~
tended to us during the Conference.
We appreciated very much your
personal interest and all that you
did for us. The girls who worked
with us showed splendid manage-
ment and cooperation and you have
a right to bc justly proud of them.

Sincerely yours.
“I. Q. SWART.

 

Dcar Dr. Brubachcr:

Please accept my hearticst
thanks for your kind entertainment
during the Conference. In cvcry
possible way T was made to feel
at home, both here at the club and
at the college.

it is my goodl fortune to attend
many of these State Conferench
throughout the country and it is
exceptional where the welcome to
the delegates is not most cordial,
but let me say that in few coniciu
cnccs have I felt a warmcr. more
wholesouled. welcome than that
given us by your students here at
State. The atmosphere of the col-
lege has been most cordial. Let me
in particular commend the young
ladies of the cafeteria who served
us delicious meals throughout the
Conference and who were con-
sistcntly eager to please and serve.
Much credit is due them.

Be sure that this entire group
of students and leaders will carry
away splendid thoughts of Albany
and of State College.

Thanking you again. I am.

Cordiallv yours.

 

S. RALPH HARLOW.

Several times tlis year editorials

Freshmen. Who answered them

Where are the other classes? Are
they going to let the Freshmen

looks so. Ono junior has kindly

ISN'T IT SO?

 

Say. folks, do you realize that we
are hidng our light under a bushel?
it’s at lactl "hut's the worst of
college, There are just a few who
sing and play. at our different func-
tions. We sure do enjoy and ap—
preciate their cllorts, but it's a
shame to (all on them continually.
And here's whcrc the hidden light
comes in. There is just heaps of
talent in State (jollch that is kept
in the dark. l‘crhaps the talented
ones are Shy. perhaps they are
modest and unilcrcslinmtc their
gifts. Wouldn’t it be just great if
we had a series of pro nuns. or
something on that order. in which
we might hear our singers per—
form? (That isn't our suggestion.
but it is the suggestion of one of
our fa-cully who is interested in the
latent talent of Slate Colclgc.) So
think it over. everybody. if you do
not sing or play perhaps you know
someone who liﬂcs, and if we cvcr
do have such a thing as a series of
“try-outs" just hand in the name
of that person to the committee in
charge.

Can't sing? Catr’tplay? Aw g'wanl
Quit yer kirldin’l If you're scared
to pct-form alone. how about a duct.
a trio. or a quartet? You could
all hold hands for moral support
and warble like sangsters. (Hum-
ming birds excepted!) But all fool-
ing aside, this is :1 worth while idea
even tho so lamer put that it needs
crutches to support it. Think this
over. and if you have an additional
idea don't be afraid to express it
through your own publication. the
“ News! "
