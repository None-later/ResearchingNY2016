STATE COLLEGE NEWS,

STUDENT ASSEMBLY

do not expect to gain all they
claim. They are talking in the lan-
guage of boundaries. " Human na-
ture," said Professor Risley, " is
not opposite but different. It is
now possible to understand higher
motives. We can appeal to better
nature."

He reminded us that the treaties
of Vienna and of Berlin, whose
work was territorial, failed. But
that from this fact we must not
think that treaties can never be
kept. We need only to remember
the agreement between America
and Great Britain concerning the
Great Lakes. The first-named two
treaties were made by autocrats.
Professor lx'isley said that the new
treaties must be based on lasting
principles, race, the existing broth-
erhood of man, democracy, open
diplomacy and looking forward to
the future. He named certain
ghosts of the past that rise as
warnings of the future: the rebirth
of a subdued nation, the tragic re—
turn of a conquered despot, and
the domination of one man at a
peace conference.

.v regards the Monroe doctrine.
l’roft-ssor lx‘isley pointed out that
isrdation has alreadv been given up,
but that non—intervention must be
a base of the League of Nations.
Arbitratimi is not intervention.

He asked that American public
opinion be allowed to express it—
self, and says that it is demanded
that we wake up and think.

INTERESTING EXPERIENCE
(Continued from page I)

was prepared. 11 was a big bomb-
ing plane with two motors —— a per-
fect beauty. We were bundled up
to our ears and wore goggles and
helmets. I had a fur—lined coat.
Helen sat beside the pilot in the
bomber's scat where she had levers
beside her to set off the bombs. I
sat in back all by myself. There
was nothing to strap me in and the
pilot told me when we got up high
I might stand up if l was careful."
Like Trip in Auto.

“Last night when l was out of
the hospital mess for dinner one of
the majors told me how awful it
seemed for the first five minutes up,
but when our propellers started to
go around and all of a sudden we
shot acorss the field and began to
ascend I felt only the sensation of
an auto trip. It was glorious. Then
i began to look down on the tiny
miniature towns below. We flew
over the forests and towns and
were so high up that the canals and
rivers looked like narrow pieces of
thread. The one landmark we had
was the River Marne."

“ How far we went or how high
I do not know though Dan said we
were little specks in the clouds.
However, we did not go above the
clouds because they were so thick
we might not have found our way
back and also we had several
bumps which dropped us swiftly.
The sensation was not as bad as
in an elevator to me though. The
worst motion was that of the wind
which rocked the plane from side
to side and was dangerous enough
for our pilot to decide he must dc—
sccnd. Never did I expect to leave
the earth, but now I want to fly
again and again. I love it as noth-
ing I have ever experienced. Even
the droos did not bother or sicken
me an I was so sorry to have it
over I called 'eneore.’ However,
the mechanics told the pilot when
we landed that he was wanted at
the headquarters for ﬂyin on such
a day,”and he was not al owed up
again.

Chance of a Lifetime.
"\thn the boys at the hut
learned what We had done they
were proud, because they said it
takes an American girl, etc. The
French .pilot came to tell us that he
had been summoned before his
connnandcr for going up when fly-
ing was forbidden, also that it was
against the regulations to take
women up. Therefore, we feel we

put one over on the others."

PROFESSOR WALKER’S
LECTURE

 

(t'ontiuued from page l)
native inhabitants of those areas
were succeeded by the lrish when
lrish immigration set in. These
were displaced by the Italians and
Jews, who in turn are being dis-
placed by (irccks, Syrians and
others. Slum conditions from the
standpoint of congetsiou were
dealt with as to the number of
rooms per apartment, number of
persons per household, nmnber of
persons per room and number of
persons per sleeping room, to-
gether with the effect of these c0n~
ditrons upon self respect, cleanli—
ness and decency. The fact that
the household of the foreign born
usually contained a large number
of boardch was considered in the
same connection."

“The slum as a ll’tllllillg ground

for citizenship or for effective in—
dustrial efﬁciency is a failure.”
‘ ” Upon wages. it is probable that
immigration has had a depressing
effect as a whole. and certainly has
prevented the natural rise in
wages which the native workmen
had a right to expect in the last
half century."

"Paupcrisnrhas been increased by
immigration. There is no satis—
factory evidence that immigration
has resulted in an increase in crime
out of proportion to the increase
of the adult male population. But,
on the other hand, the character
of crime has been changed and in
the direction of personal violence
and away from crime against prop—
erty. The insane whose main-
tenance by the State constitutes
an appreciable public burden has
been increased by immigration as
a result of racial traits, change of
climate, change of occupation and
habits of life."
