Second Broker: "And the man
who is born with plain common
sense is one of them.”

From Willie’s Essay
We oughta eat more ﬁsh, The
ﬁsh is a clean animile you will
never see it romping in the dusty
road or scratching in the dirt and
it takes a bath every day whether
it needs it.or not."

Just Like Dad's
"Now, my littl man," said the
barber, “how wou d you like your

"Just like papa’s," little Joseph
replied, “ with a round hole at the

So Do Most of Us
"How (lid the seed get into the
orange? ” asked Evelyn.
“ Why, silly, it grew there," said
Mary.
“ V'ell," Sit-Id Evelyn, “I wish it
had grown on the outside."

 

Given Away

Conjurer.-—“ Now, to help me
with this next trick, i want the
services of a boy—just any boy
in the audience. Yes, you will do,
my little man; come along. Now,
you’ve never seen me before, have
you?"

Boy (innocently),——” No, fatherl"

 

Not So Foolish

Sambo had been haled before the
court on a: charge oi chicken-steal-
ing. A great deal of very damaging
testimony had been submitted to
substantiate the charge. There
was no lawyer present to‘defcnd
Sambo, and when the prosecution
had completed its ease the judge
turned to him and said:

“ on are charged with stealing

chickens; have you any wit—
nesses?”
“No, suh!” answered Sambo.

“\thn I steal chickens I don't
have no witnesses! ”

 

Flattery Did It
“You seem aide-bodied and
healthy; you ought to be strong

enough to work." she remarked
scrutmizmgly.
“Yes, ma’am, I know. And you

seem beautiful enough to be on the
stage; but evidently you prefer the
simple life.”

Mr. Blank—“Did you tell the
cook that the beefsteak was
burned? ”

‘Mrs. Blank——~"Mcrcy, no! She
would leave instantly. I told her
it was just right. but that we pre~
ferred it a trifle umlcrdone."

One of the German grand dukes

"Germany will win the war, Mr.
Gerard, with perseverance: for, as

you know, perseverance always
conquers.”

"Always?" asked Mr. Gerard.
“How about the hen on the china
egg?"

Getting Even
Butcher: "This pound of butter
you sent me is three ounces short.”
Grocer: “Well, 1 mislaid the
pound weight, so I weighed it by
the pound of chops you sent me
yesterday."

 

Pure Immagination

The teacher was trying to give
her pupils an illustration of the
word “perseverance.”

“What is it," she asked. “that car-
ries a man along rough roads and
smooth roads, up hill and down,
through the jungles of doubt and
through the swamps of despair?”

There was a silence, and then
Johnny, whose father was an au—
tomobile dealer, spoke up:

“Please, ma’am,” he said, “There
ain’t no such automobile."

Well, Willie Couldn't!

“Why, Willie," said his mother,
“how is it you only got sixty in
mathematics this month, and last
month you got ninety?"

“it ain't my fault; the teacher
moved the boy in front of me to
the lirst seat.”

 

Constant Variety
Crawford: “Don’t you lind that
home-cooking becomes rather
monotonous?”
(Trabshaw: “Not at our house.
My Wile has a new cook every few
weeks."

They Clean Up Just the Same

“I shouldn't say a word about
our army, 1 know,” said Mrs. Muf-
l'm, “but. really, they must be sadly
in need of a good, competent
housekeeper at those camps—it’s
something scandalous the way the
papers tell about them (lining in a
mess all the time."

The Wrong Direction
A teacher was explaining to her
class that if one wished to do any-
thing well one had to begin at the
bottom, when a voice from the
back interrupted her:
“How about swimming. teacher?”

The young bride went to th
grocery store to do her mornng
marketing. She was determined
that the grocer should not take ad—
vantage of her youth and inexperi-
ence.

“These eggs are
small," she criticized.

"I know it," he answered, "but
that’s the kind the farmer brings
me. They are just fresh from the
country this morning."

"Yes," said the bride," and that’s
the trouble with those farmers.
They are so anxious to get their
eggs sold that they take them oi?
the nest too soon."
