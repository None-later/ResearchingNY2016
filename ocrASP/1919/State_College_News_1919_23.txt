istry (‘lnb ' ield on Friday, ‘
March 7. Miss Carniody, one of the
instrnrtt in the Chemistry Depart-
ment, gate a talk on perfumes, touc lv ‘
in: on the history and nnmufarturc'
of them. i
' Perfumes were. first used in the‘
flrienlal countries, especially China
and lndia. .\fter a time their use
spread into Europe, and grew very
much there. Ancientfireece and Rome
were the chief centers of the indus-
try. At the. time when the. films and
(hubs invaded the country, the man-
ufacture was almost entirely obliter—
ated. \\'hen the C Isades were taking
place, however, it cattle hack and has
grown ever since. At one time laws
were passed in the English Parlia—
ment to prohibit the industry. At
present the countries most engaged
in it are France, ltaly, and England.
They rank in the order in which they
are named. (irasse, in France, leads
the other cities of Europe in the pro-
duction of perfumes.

Four methods of extraction of oils
are used, They are expression. dis—
tillation. maceration, and enflum'agc.
These methods were diseussed quite
extensively. Very few perfumes con-
sist of the individual perfumes for
which they are named. Perfumes
are of two kinds, natural and syn~
thetic. The natural ones are of veg~
viable and animal origin. The ani~
Iual perfumes are, musk. civct, and
amhcrgris. The synthetic consist of
proper mixtures of various organic
compounds most of which are of
higher carbon content. Several sam-
ples of perfumes made by a class in
organic chemistry were inspected.
