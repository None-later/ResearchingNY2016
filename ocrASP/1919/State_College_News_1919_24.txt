IN THE MATTER OF
APPOINTMENTS

in Ed. |l l’rof. Saylcs stresses
the matter of ltcepii i, appointments
until there is no excuse for a senior
who is late in keeping an appoint-
nicut. At least he knows better
than to be late or to cut. if he.
does so, Mr. Saylcs can’t be blamed.

Seriously though, l‘llCl‘L' is noth-
ing more exasperatiug than to Wait
endlessly for some person to keep
his appointment, To be on time
and then to he kept waiting is good
reason for anger and disgust.

Common courtesy demands that
we, as students, wait at reasonable
length of time for faculty fulfillment
of engageiu its. But does it de-
mand that the period of waiting be
indcliiiite in length? Take a case
in point. If a practice teacher have
a two o’clock appointment with a
critic, should he be required to wait
until three for the critic to come?
is it not just that the practice
teacher concerned considers that
the critic has broken his or her
part of the mutual verbal contract,
and that the appointment is can-
celled? Should he be blamed if he
leave. after waiting a reasonable
length of time? Again common
courtesy intruder. its demands. If
one party must he an hour late, or
is unable to keep an] appointment,
courtesy insists that the other
party be notified. -

Another phase of the question:—
If a student have an appointment
with the President, Dean, or Dean
of Women, and it he he punctual
in keeping the appointment, should
he be forced to sit outside for a
half hour, or more, while other
facult members make urgent or
casua calls upon the other party
concernch in the appointment?
Any student would be reasonable
enough to step aside for a few ino-
ments if asked to do so by a faculty
member. But to give way before
three is an imposition —— especially
when one or all of the three usurp
the time without even a "pardon
me." 7
True enough. " faculty are fa~
culty." but it is equally true that
“ appointments are appointments.”

STATE COLLEGE NEWS, March 13,1919

PEDAGOGUE SLAMS

“Slants”, are funny. They are
often the most entertainingpart 0
college publications, They have a
legitimate place in all such publi-
calions, hilt. like all good things,
they have a limit in their places.

Apt jokes, classroom brilliaiicics
ti), favorite quotations. kindly

humorous charactcrizatious are
allowable. llut the borclcrliiud lies
clusc. Upperclussmcii wdl rciucin—

her the famous “ l\'o|lctch Kolulu”
which ran for some st-vcral weeks
in the tirst volume of the "News."
At first it was purely amusing, then
it beciunc so harsh and personal
and cutting, that President llru—
bacher had it dropped from the re-
gular departments of the "News."
This measure was preventive rather
than curative. II was a highly cinn-
menilaldc measure.

The l't-tla'guguc slams are final.
They cannot be currd, nor can they
lie prt-vcnlctl.

The spirit of the board of editors
as cvidenc‘ed thus far seems to bc
praiscworthy. There is one. in-
stance to the contrary. is it really
funny, and is ii not a hit unkind to
plclttre and annnunce in the college
year-book the person who is the
bigch lilutfcr? .'\u extreme case,
perhaps. but an instance is known
in which a student lost an oppor-
tunity ior a good nosition because
he was considered by his col-
leagues . t.

Again, it is generally Irue that
every person knows his own weak
points. his own faults. lit-tier than
his associ. es know them. It is

     

     

nnnc ssary, then. for a collch
publication to "rub" these sorc
spots.

Yes. we knmv it is true that

“people who lit'c in glass houses
shouldn’t thrth stones." The
“News” has been guilty of this
saun- otft-nsr. lint it is our honest
effort to be careful in this respect.
And as the medium of student ex-
pression. the “ News" should
make this suggestion.

.iccziiise the Pedagogne slams are
final, it: is to lie. hoped that they
will be moderate. it is most
ardt-ntly desired that no student
shall have the lump memories of
four years at State érillcgc obliter-
ated by nasty slams in the year-
book. And it is to be hoped lhat
tlic l9l9 Pedagogue will be a book
which every student will be proud
and anxious to show to all his
friends, not such a book that hurt
pride will cause him to conceal it
from even his closest friends,

 

AGREE?

How about it, folks—don't we
all feel the same way—that sniftly.
snuffly " sprig is cumbing" feeling?
Of cotirse Spring is cmning——(just
notice the hats if you doubt it)—
but wouldn't it be better to sniff it
naturally instead of thru the folds
of a handkerchief? It's only a inat-
ter of personal care. Just,curb for
a while that desire to bring forth
the rcgarnis'lied old last year’s suit,
or to present the new to pttblic
gaze. Low shoes are es eciavlly
conducive to colds. Just because
the “flu” epidemic is over is no
reason for carelessness in dress.

c all know that poor health
works in a direct ratio with ponr
work, and lowers the standard of
the college. Therefore, let's be
careful. Take the necessar pre-
cautions. and give the State Con ege
our best.

 

’21, HERE’S T0 vom

'l‘lic iutcrclass meet last Friday
night was one of the best exam ilcs
of'class spirit seen in State Lol egc
fora long time. We cannot let this
oc'iortunity slip ‘lly without coni-
ineiitiug highly upon that spirit.
hivcu though the frosh surpassed
the stiphs, did the loyal supporters
of the latter sit back and :iiile
Not much! They aiplaudcd just
as vociferously for tie opponents
as they did for 'ZI. They gave
credit where credit was due. And
then. when the annnuiiccincnt was
madcthat thc ii‘nsh wcrc victorious
—-a: faint clapping from the snplis?
. n. The words were scarcely ut-
tered before the suphs gave the
best, snappicst. and the peppicst
yell for '22 that you would ever
wish to hear.

’Zl, we’re proud of you, and of
your splendid sporttnanship. We
hold you up to the college as an
example of tlie real spirit that
should In.- manifest in all otir
rivalries. Again, '21, here‘s to you!
