STOP, LOOK AND LISTEN!
Bargain Day on Song Books

Someone has said that “opportu-
nity knocks frequently and she
sometimes Wears mittens.” This
may be trite in some cases, and it.
certainly is-n't true in regard to
YOUR opportunity to buy a Col-
lege 50m,r book at a reduced price.
Just think of it! You who have
begrudged a dollar for (me. of the
best song books on the market can
change your tune now because by
purchasing a book this month you
will save a quarter—and you can
buy a thrift stamp with that change
if your patriotic conscience nricks
you.

Surely, you are not going to let
a bargain like this slip away.
Here’s your chance. to get your
money’s worth. Let people see

that we are a real college by show-
ing them that we have a song book
full of tuneful melodies that can
take their places beside those of
any other live, progressive college.
Then beg, borrow
seventy-ﬁve cents!

or earn that

Slide: it’s the home of the reckless
l~l)un't—('aa‘e, where the (Viive—lt-
lips abide. The town is as old as
the human race, and it grows with
the llight of years; it is wrapped in
the for; of the idler’s dreams, its
streets are paved with discarded
schem s. and are sprinkled with
useless tears. ~—('opied.
