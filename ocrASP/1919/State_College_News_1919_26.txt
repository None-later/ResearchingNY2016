Cause for Tears.

 

The youngest came crying to his
motier.

" Why. desiriel“ she exclaimed,
"what is the matter ’ '

“ Dad was lifting a big hex and
it fell on his toes." explained the
child between sohit.

" tut," continued the mother,
“ that is hardly anything to cry
alinoul; you should have laughed at
i

“ .I did,“ said the hey.
There's a Reason
“llut why did yoti name him
Hill?"
“Well, you see he was born on

the ﬁrst of the month."

Intellectual Test

 

It‘s quite stylish these days for
collhge profs to invent intellectual
tests. The would-lie student takes
’em to see if it's worth his pulcr’s
pocketbook’s ivhile to send him
through college. If he Ilops on the
attic tests, according to the profs,
there ain't no use in him going
through college except with a
broom as junior janitor. Here‘s a
savniple, brother, liet out the pen-
cil and ticker. If you can't go
through it in 30 seconds without a
stumble, there‘s nothing left for
you to do but he a hallplaycr.

Mark with yes or no. Is rasp—
herry jaiii a jelly?-—Il eggs were
selling for Lie a dozen, could you
get two dozen for a cent and n
quarter?—ls corned beef and cab-
bage a fruit? If so, write PEEP
backwards—if not give the last
name of the gent who invented the
Ford—If ll mole can wink, cross
the f in cough, and if the 4th of
July falls on the 5th give the right
answer to this wrong problem,
2x7 equals 9—.

The college irot“s got the wrong
rope. If a tel ow can‘t pass those
tests, he ought to go to college and
get something driller] into his
Copied.

His Point of View

 

"\Vho can tell me a thing of im-
portance that did not exist a hun-
dred years ago?" asked the new
teacher.

" Me,” piped the small boy in the
class.

 

No EXcuse Accepted

 

The evangelist was entreating his
hearers to flee from the wrath to
come.

.“l warn you," he said, " there
WIII he weeping and wailing and
gnashing of teeth.“

t this point an old lady in the
gallery stood up.

“Sir,” she interrupted, "I have
no teeth."

"Mada‘in," said the evangelist,
sternly, teeth will be provided."

 

Shameful

 

Two verypretty girls met on the
street and kissed each other raptor.

‘ously. Two young men watched
. the meeting. "There’s another of

those things that are so unfair,"

said one.

r“ What is that?” said his friend.
He pointed to the scene: "Wo-

men doing men's work!"

with an admiring glance at the

'girls, "you sure have the right

hail."

Joe: “ Why, father, I think she
has seen the notice: ‘Now is the
time to lay in coall‘ "

The Hand to Hold

 

If I might hold that hand again,
Clasped lovingly in mine,

I’d little care what others sought—-
That hand I held lang syne!

That hand! So warm it was and
Soft! Ne’er was a softer thing!
Ah, me! I'll hold it ne‘er again—
Ace, ten, knave, queen and king.

look in his eyes?"
"Yc9 H

“I know that fellow. He’s prob-

ably wondering where he’s going

to get the mom: to pay the next
installment on his car."

Not Much Bait

Two men were discussing as to
what Noah did to pass away the
time on board the ark. ‘ guess
he did a good deal of fishing,” sug—
gested the ardent angler.

But someone is always ready
with a wet lilainket. " He couldn’t
do much fishing with only two
worms," was the retort.

In a Friday Quiz at 3:25
Dr. Beik: "On what ground did
Luther nail his theses?"
oice: " Pardon me, Dr. Beik,
but he nailed them on the doorl”

Lickin’ and Larnin’

 

A school teacher in one of the
counties of New York State re-
cently received the following note
from the mother of one of her
pupils:

“Dear Mis. You writ me about
whipping Sammy. I hereby give
you permission to beet him up eny
time it is necessary to learn him
lessons. He is just like his father.
You have to learn him with a club.
Pound nolegc into him. I want
him to git it and don’t pay no aten-
shion to what his father says, I'll
handle him."

A Clever Plan

lie—"Dearest, I’ll go to your
father and ask his consent at
once!"

She—“Wait until after the ﬁrst

of the month when my dress-_

maker's bill reaches him, He will
he more willing to part with me
then.”
