The entire hour of Student r\s«
selubly on liriday, .\lnreh M. was
given over to the third of the Hericr‘v

encc questions. .\lr, llidley spoke
on “The Near 15:1 and the Peace
t.‘oufercnee." llis lecture was in
part as follows:

“Anyone who undertakes to ur-
nanizc a lecture out of the chaos of
misiuformation and opinion relat-
int,r to lllt' .\'ear Eastern situation
runs into the danger of not know-
ing what he is talking: about, espe—
cially because of the tlood of pro-
pauantlis material that has swept
over this country since the opening
of the documentary contlict now
wae'cd for ,\merican support of
claims, boundaries, economic op.
pnrtunily, etc. So far the confer-
ence l 'tS maintained a silence about
the Near East that is disturbing,
particularly to those who want the
truth. hilt lllltl it so distorted by
partisan argument.

"The purpose of the Jugo-Slav,
t‘ointniﬁnion to the United States
is not so much the truth about the
South Slavic peoples as what they?
want and why they expect to re-
ceive it at the linal settlement.‘

AMERICANIZATION
INSTITUTE

 

 

 

 

The institute was addressed last
Saturday. March 14, by Dr. Hutchin-
son of State College, and Miss Har—
riet. Dow of New York. .

The former lectured on “Citizen—
ship by Naturalization." 'He said
that only whites and blacks could re«
eeive naturalization papers and that
this excluded Chinese and Indians.
The latter, however, may become citi—
zens of the United States by a special
treaty or act of Congress, or if he
leaves his tribe and adopts civilized
life. llc also took up the case with
women, to whom the same laws ap-
ply, except that if she is the wife oi
an alien man, she cannot be natural—
ized duringr the marriage existence.
Dr. Hutchinson will continue the
same subject next Saturday.

.‘ iss Harriet 'Dow, Field Secretary
of 1c Yorkville Neighborhood Asso-

the morning.

PROFESSOR RISLEY
SPEAKS BEFORE CITY
CLUB

On Saturday. March 15, l‘roics-
sor liisley spoke before the lunch-
euu of the City t‘luh at the llatup-
ton Hotel.

In said, in part:

“There is no real oppositiou'iu
the United States to av league. if
this were the only plan to be pre-
sented, it would be the patriotic
duty of every man and woman to
support it without, reservation. The
s; rilice of our boys, the crimson
stars and the gold stars in loyal
Albany call clearly for some safe-
guard against a repetition of ruth-
less war.

“But this is not the last possi-
bility for a league, this now pre-
sented. Do we, who unhesitating-
ly favor this plan, do so with the
desire to do a ‘big' thing rather
titan a good and wise one?

“ All plans for settlement resolve
themselves into three classes, the
impossible, the fairly adequate and
the clearly acceptable. History
would class with the impossible a
repetition of the quadruple and
quintuple alliance of a hundred
years ago. There is a hint of this
in the league, in so for as it pro-
vides for a majority of ﬁve states
m the executive council. Likewise,
the Hague conference has shown
its inability to stop wars. The
present plan differs from that in
providing for economic coercion,
and a partial scheme for disarma—
ment and for military coercion.

" Senator Lodge has summed up
the criticisms fairly in stating that
the league draft is like the draft of
a preliminary committee, and that
it needs revision, with clear and
positive statement. Therefore the
league falls into the second class,
the fairly inadequate.

“Supporters of the league point
out to- ay the analogy of the adop-
tion of the federal Constitution and
