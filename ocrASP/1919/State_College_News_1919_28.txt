THE FRESHMAN PARTY

mumhcrs ml the class Hf '33. L
are not far wrng whcn we say that
thurc is much indignation amongr
thc upln-rclassmcn.

it is tough luck. to say the least,
that '22 cannot haw;- hcr chance to
show off her talcnt and ability in
tho lit-Id of sncial crcnts. .\ftcr a

in "proper conduct at social

even it: 'c their own party, to make
practical lllL‘ll' training. The snit—
i~uing suggestion that Junior l'rnm
and Senior liall will comp uycutu-
ally is prctty flimsy solacc.

Suppose lllc frosh have bot-n cn~
tcrtaiuul a great deal! What pos-
sihlc harm could a dozen more
parties do? Suppose. they did miss
live weeks of cullch he'ansc of the
“ tlu " epidemic! All tho morc rea-
son for making up for lost time.

Causes for nppt-r lassman indig-
nation are many. l‘lI‘SL thorc is the
cumulative causu of many such
manifesto-tian of an anti-nood-timc
policy. Secondly, upper-clasmicn
want college traditions. Thcy have
worked hard for thc cstnhlislnncnt
of traditions. .-\nd so few pcrma-
ucnt ones have resulted that thc loss
of even one means much. (.Tlass
partics urn firmly established tra-
ditions. in fact thcy are probably
the Oldest.

sorority hall is to he held at the

" good to he true," \‘Vit'hholth
ing the frcslunau class party proved
the lie.

This is not merely a pl-a for
freshmen. Nor is it just a hit of
indignation over one affair. it is
a case of “last straw.” ln (inmo-
ttralic America it is hard to submit
to arbitrary rule without even rcp-
resentntiun,

is it democratic that a student
body submit to such a policy? Rap-
rescntatiou and the right of appeal
arc granted (no, BELONG) to all
tltc governed. Why are these privi-
