OUR TEAM

After last Saturday night’s battle
and victorious score of 29—27,
there's no doubt but that " our
boys are there." With the possible
exception of the R. P. l. victory of
two years ago, never was excite-
ment so high pitched as at the
State-i ’avy game.

And ncvcr did State have a team
more dcscrviiig- of cheers and
praise. They're putting State Cob
lcgc on the map and honoring the
Purple and Gold in a wonderful
way. Minerva and her six hundred
rooters are proud of the men who
have won three out of four games
thus far this year.

 

“HOME INDUSTRY"

While we’re bragging up the
team, the Quarterly. the News, the
Pedagoguc. and others of State’s
glories, let us .includc draniatics.
The crowd which lilled the auditor-
ium last Friday showed that we pat-
ronize “ homc industry." Likewise,
let’s praise it.

Under the able coaching of Miss
Agnes Futtcrcr, ’16, a graduate of
our 0er college and a dramatic critic
of wide renown, thrccrsplcndidly
produced plays were given in the
auditorium. The casts were made
up of " our own ” people, the plays
staged and managed by “our own "
people. and the scenic and lighting
effects done by “home industry."

The success of the plays was
largely dependent on the efforts of

Marion licolc. Emma Gray and
Isidore Purth as directors and
managers.

Wit-bout the work of Manvillc,
’19. andBaker. ‘21. the added charm
of scenic and lighting effects would
have been lost. They deserve
great credit for their splendid
work in this ﬁeld.

No one could possibly have ren-
dcr‘cd the ” arden ” atmosphere
of “The Rescue" better than Agnes
Denuin, Marie Wendling and Mary
Goodrich.

 

' STATE COLLEGE news, FEBRUARY 6. 19:9

Whoever has lived in a small

town knows that ” Neighbors ” was
superbly interpreted by llctty
Gardner, Peggy Van Ness, lgcg.
Bruce, Vita Merritt, Ethel Mclxcn-
na, George Schiwvouc, Gertrude
Green and Harriet Doyle.

The true art in Laura Macfurlanc,
Ethel lchcnua and lflorciicc
Stubbs’ presentation of “The Maker
of Dreams," needs no comment.

The point to be made is that
Friday’s plays were the product of
" home industry "—a product to be
proud of, and an industry that
magnifies Stiiic College.

A HELLO SOCIETY VS.
AN ICEBERG SOCIETY

 

One of the greatest needs of
State (Lullch is the organization of
a Hello society. This is one move-
ment in which every studcut could
and should share, Such a society
has no constitution, no ofliccrs, no
dues, mcmlmrsbip being dependent
on good will. its object is recog—
nition of State College students by
State College students.

In a college of this size it should
not take longer than a semester
to learn fuccs—cvcn if names are
never lcarncd. Yet, there are some
seniors who have known other
seniors for seven semesters, and
still offcr no Sign or recognition at
a facc~io—i'ucc inccling. Evidently
thcsc fuir maids belong to an ice«
licri,r society, Om: fairly shuddch
with the chill of their atmosphere.
And some of those people have
served on connnittccs with others,
yet :icquniutunccsliip ceases with
duty.

\‘Vhilc wc all admire modesty, we
do dislike an ovcrdi'ziwu shyness.
Perhaps it is “proper” to wait for
u properly chapcroncd, formal iii-
ti‘oductinu. but let's don't be
proper.

A good start has been made by
'21. in the list of freshmen rules,
freshmen have to speak to sopho—
mores and Myskaiihi members.
And there is no cmbarrasnrcnt felt
by zniy of the parties concerned.
it is far plt‘zlsantcr to a freshman,
or to a Mysknnia member, to go to
a test after a dozen or more “lick
105" on route, than after steering
himself carefully around and away
from a bunch of iceberg girls.

One of the greatest joys of going
home is the cheer of friendly greet-
ings; and one of the greatest causes
of the “blues” is the forlorn feel-
ing of knowing no one, and zinger
at wilful failure to Show rccogui~
lion adds to the disugrccnblc fccl-
ing of loneliness. Seniors do not
experience that because they have
made enough worth-while friends
that icy snubs don’t count. But
freshmen mush laugh to themselves
at the written and spoken welcomes
given in September and the chilly
snubs in June—and succeeding
years.

Why can't we, of State, remedy
this? A simple nod or “Hello”
costs nothing and does much, No
loss of dignity is necessary, and
much spirit is gained. Let us then
say “ Hello" to everybody from
State—in the spirit of
“Are you from State, are you from

State "

“Well, I’m from State College too."

And don’t forget the faculty. Our
President has often expressed a.
wish to be spoken to in the balls or
on the street. Others feel the same
way.

Let the ice melt, the dignity dis-
appear, and snobbishncss cease to
exist. A Hello society vs. an Ice-
berg society will help to make State
College

 

OUR OTHER HALF

Altlro‘ this college of ours is a
perfect whole yet, in it there are
twu distinct divisions—limolty and
Strident. These are coiigcuially iii-
tcrmiii led in every phase of col-
lege li . State College now has
true spirit in the making—fast lll
tlur making.

Everybody at our game Saturday
night will testify to that. The
bleachers at both borne games
shook beneath the cheers of one
division mentioned above. We
missed our faculty. We felt in-
complete without them. Surely
our competition with other colleges
is a vital part of us here. We
know ihut our faculty are just us
proud of our splendid team as we
arc—«we want to feel that they
share that pride with us on the
spot. Game with Colgate next
Saturday night! '19 and ’22,

We’d leave all our dignity as teach-

have an ice carnival on the park
lake maybe (that is if it keeps cold
long enough). We could have

between classes, and freezing of

make us forget, Anyhow let’s do
something drastic. What do you

SOPHS, READ THIS

In the matter of enforcing,r our
freshmen rules, some of us are
rather disappointed because of the
way it; is ——or rather, is not—done.
Half the fun of the first two years
of college life is thc Freshman-
Sopliomore rivalry. and the more a
class is tormented its ﬁrst year,
the more will it appreciate its ad-
vantage when the tables are turned
the second year. For this reason
some Freshmen, at least, are disap-
pointed at the apparent lack of ob-
servance and enthusiasm iii our
most worthy opponents in this in—
ter-class rivalry.

The way in which they fail to
observe instances in which we
break rules is simply astonishing.
For a Soph, an officer at that, to
allow a Freebie to drink at the
fountain while she stands calmly
by and waits for the Frosh to ﬁnish
and then does not post the delin-
quent's name for penalty, is cvi—
deuce of nire's failing to use oppor—

 

tunities given. There are sortie of
us li‘rcslmicu who have worn high
school insignia all the car, just for
the privilege of wearing the pen-
alty, a safety pin, for a while, and
yet a loyal Sopli has not yet put‘ni
an appearance with the safety pins
to bestow upon us. Surely this
rival class of ours needs to have
its eyes tested.

But even Wllcl1.tlle class DO
notice a rule being broken, it is
about as enthusiastic as claims in
penalizing the culprit. 'Il‘hc hrst
penalty day was rather cXClting, nud
tllcl‘c were quite a number of Soplis
in attendance. By the third limo,
however, interest in “ having some
fun with the brush" bad so far
waned that only the officers in
charge wurc present. liven they
did not have enough enthusiasm
to think up some new penalty, or
even to arrive on time. And now
we ii;ch not been worried by u
penalty day for some weeks, which
is a great pity, because now we
lircshics will never fully upprcciutc
' 22.

our privileges next year.

WHAT DO YOU SAY?

You know—Abe llllL‘Sl :issct going
is a smile. Gloomy fa‘ccs mean sad
and bitter hearts. And with such a
feeling you can’t possibly dig up a
smile. Sn. iuslcad of happiness,
there’s idncss given—if only for
a while. if, instead of scowling,
we would always have a smile——
iliinkpf all the gludireSs we would
pass along. if only for a while. Of
course exams iirc horrid, of course
we’re feeling glum, But just the
same, a smile would help ourselves
and others at least some. Lot's-
when we meet each other-«in the
class or in the hall—let’s smile, and
create an armor that‘s iuvulucrablc
to cxilms and quizzes and all.

 

We have an i\—K-—C and u“Pcp"
club—Let's have a smile club too.
