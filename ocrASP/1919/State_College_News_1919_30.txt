'STUDENT ASSEMBLY
(Continued from page I.)
was organized not primarily to

’ spread all the authentic informa-

tion, but to produce arguments to
prove that Italy's claims are those
of redemption—of history—and not
of conquest. ‘T’llc Truth about
Bulgaria‘ has just appeared in
print. Magya-sb have opench bead-
quarters in Berne, Switzerland, for
their campaign of ‘publicity.’

»“ It is clear from the mad rush to
get evidence arid counter-evidence
into the hands of the grand jury of
American opinion and from Em
ropc‘s expression of faith in Amer-
ican honesty, and from the part we
professed to play in the Great War,
we cannot avoid the duty of know-
ing something about this plague
spot of Europe. Here are a few of
the problems and difﬁculties, the
settlement of which may contain
the germ for a future war and pro-
vide Germany with an opening,’ for
menacing the treaty of ersailles:
’l‘he ltallan lugo-Slav quarrel, Ru-
manian—Serbian cliflicreucL-soverthe
Banat of Tcmesvar, the relation of
Poles to Germans and Czechs, the
Julgarian boundary, the Gracco-
ltalian controversy regarding Al-
bania and the Dodccancsc, and the
passini,r of Turkey.

" The chufercncc will need ﬁrst to
recognize the facts as they are. A
settlement that ignores them is
bound to be a cause for war. ills-
tory teaches that an imposed peace
will create now and vcxini: contro-
versi s. li’cacc conferences of the
nineteenth century are persistent
reminders that an arrangement (lis—
regarding absolutely the practical
situation and proceeding from iblind
adherence to principles and then—
rics or from the pressure of ma-
terial interest is a powder magazine
that is ready for a new spark. Self—
determination, so far as it leaves
with the peoples concerned the
marking out of new boundary lines,
will transmit to the future disquiet-
ing controversies. Conditional
self-determimition with a view to
establishing an anti-German barrier
and promoting the common wel-
fare and security appears now to be
the least hazardous.

"I speak of an anti-German bar—
rier because the new Germany aris-
ing out of the flame of war is the
Germany of old, unrepentant, ready
to plot, intrigue, and form secret
alliances with the discontented and
dissatisﬁed new states. I speak of
conditional self-determination in
the sense of full liberty of judg—
ment in domestic matters consis-
tent with the common welfare, .of
giving a bearing to all demands, of
securing adequate authentic infor—
mation by means of an expert com-
mission to be named to study the
facts from every angle, and, then,
after a careful, impartial consider-
ation of race, geography, natural
resources, and commercial outlets,
of proceeding from the evidence to
a. decision. In fact the most satis-
factory boundary ever drawn be—
tween Serbia and Bulgaria was that
recommended by a commission of
experts sent by the Congress of
Berlin in 1878 to study the problem.

“ But the congress discarded the
information and erected a military
and stragetic frontier against Bul—
garia. Byside-stcpping the prac—
tical situation the Congress of Ber-
lin «brought forth not a settlement,
but a scrap of paper—to be torn up.

"A procedure that takes into
consideration the facts as they are,
makes sure that the evidence is all
in, and arrives at an impartial ad-
justment with a” clear vision of
what the future should mean, is a

   

 

tremendous break with the_paet.
Snell a procedure, therefore, gives
the situation a complete hen-ring m
the court of open diplomacy.

"Nothing will so adequately forc-
stall a recrudescence of the con-
fusion and hatred and rivalry
which provided capital for Pan-
Cicrman intrigue in the decade be-
fore the outbreak bf the war in
l9l4. lf selﬁsh partisanship or nar-
row favoritism enter for a moment
into the making of a putter: for the
Near East, the result will be a
crime against civilization, a scrap
of paper that will provide the new
lqu. tliirsliup; for revenge, with
SDIllCtlllllj: to tear up.

" Finally. the new concert of
powers or lcau'ne of nations—-
whatever form or name the new
international order takes—-will have
to exercise a supervision over the
arrangement, will need to aid the
new states to prepare themselves
for that form of free government
which Abra-ham Lincoln deﬁned in
his first inaumlral as a government
by ‘n majority held in restraint by
constitutional checks and limita-
tions. and always changing casin
with deliberate channg of popular
opinions and sentiments,‘ this is
‘the only true sovereign of a free
people: whoever rejects it does of
necessity lly to anarchy or despot—
ism.’

“Unanimity is impossible, rule
of the minority as a permanent
arrangement is inadmissible, reject-
ing; the majority principle, anarchy
or despotism is left.

" Having noticed the dangers in-
volved in making a settlement, and
having pointed to a 1 ‘clbonl of pm—
cudnrc. i will sum up the reasons
for hope and optimism in respect
to the Near East as ' see them:
Trust in the United States; an im-
partial iutelligent judgment reached
by the procedure outlined above; a.
permanent commission of experts
to study and give advice regarding
alterspcace problems; a conviction
that the American people play fair
and that, whatever the new inter—
national structure, if the United
States of America is one of the con-
tractinar builders of it, it will be a
safe place for everybody, every
nation to live in; the developmcnt
of that kind of free government
Lincoln so perfectly defined, and
the formation of a United States of
Central liuropc with Czecho-Slova-
ltia as a nucleus. and of a United
States of the Balkans with Ru-
mania or Greece as a nucleus
(though these proposed groups
lack racial and linguistic bases for
unity, yet the ind of free govern-
ment described is a strong bond of
union); and. lastly. a new interna~
tional order constructed out of the
American principles of majority
government, non-intervention, arbi—
tration, open door, and open (lip—
loma-cy.

“Assuredly it is with a sense of
pride that we can watch the actual
transit of the ideals of the New
World moving out across the At-
lantic to aid in redressing the
balance of the Old.”

“Of course, you have studied the
Baconian theory?”

"No." said Mr. Stormingtoa
Barnes. “i don't believe that tak-
ing Shakespeare’s name off the
program and putting Bacon’s on
would bring a single extra nickel

into the box office.

Percival—“Gosh! Isn’t it rain-
mg!"

Pansie—“cher mind, boysie;
take father’s umbrella, then per—
haps he won't so much mind your
coming ltack."
