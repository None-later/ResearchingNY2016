colleges have tricd'to do away with
this event, because it is so danger-

the onlookers. We are pleased to

 

see this event discarded. Another
change will be the awarding of
princes for lirst. second. third and
fourth. instead of just first. second
and third. :\ll other events and
rules governing the events will be
the same as the New England Col—
