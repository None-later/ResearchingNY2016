A NEW ALMA MATER

this rcuson it will always have its
place in any collection of Stutc
College songs. Dnuhtlcss it will
he one of the few most sung.

The call for a new almu mater
comes hccausc of several reasons.
Thu one we now use, uud the one
mentioned ahnvc. is writtcn too
high, or has too great a range for
the average collt‘gc student. lior
proof of this, listen to flu: distinct
falling-0H of voices at the “high
spots" duringr unison singing.
Again, it is too dillicull. or else
otherwise faulty. clsc why docs not
everyone know his» .alma mntcr?
We need an almu mater which
everyone can, and will learn.

Moreover, it is not .in cvcry dc-
tail a true alma mater. lt‘is not
distinctly a State College song, for
its musical setting is adapted from
another source. ()nr alma matcr
should hnvc words and music he—
.longing'st‘rictiy to State College.

liar some time students have
been stic‘gcsting a change. Many
wish to have " College of the Elm
pirr State" adopted. Perhaps this
would be wise. Yet it has seemed
mlvisahle to open a contest for new
and original songs.

Because of the deep-felt nccd for
a distinctly State College song, and
because of frequent student peti-
tion for a new ttlma mater, Mys—
kzmia has inaugurated a contest.
This contest is open to all students
and faculty. Wnrds and music are
most desired. but contrilmlions of

  

words, with suggestions for
adopted settings, will he con-
sidered. No pecuniary prize is of—
fcrcd. hut thc distinct honor of

being the cnmposcr of nnc’s alum
mutcr should he a sufﬁcient impetus
for many contributions.

The contest closes April 25th,
the liriday after Easter vacation.
Cousirlt'ring the number of musi-
cians and poets among faculty and
students. it is to be hoped that a
splendid ncw State (Jollch ulma
mater. will be written and chris—
tcncd moviug‘up day.
