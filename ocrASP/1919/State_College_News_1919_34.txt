Mi5s Baldwin's second year Eng-
lish class entertained Miss McCon-
nell’s class and Miss Jones at a
Sophomore Banquet. Miss Loretta

, Weldon )resided as toast-mistress.

The foluwing responded with
toasts:
Mr. iJnrrett. The Class History.
Miss lluckmaster, Class Proph-

y.
Miss Mcdwin. Class Will.

Mr. Elliott, Class Athletics.
Miss Emeriek,‘ lClass Spirit.
Miss Smith, Class Ambitions.
Mr. Miller liten gave an exceed—
ingly appropriate poem entitled
“Jane Jones,” Miss Jones gave a

delightful toast which brought all

members of the class into a closer
bond of friendship with "the critic."
.‘\fter refreshments were served
Miss Whitten brought the event to
a very pleasing close by singing
two delightful solos. Let us fur-
titer this interest in Oral English!
instead of the monotonous hum-
(Il‘lllll assignments let us give in-
teresting ones to bring out each
pupiis' individuality and spon-
taneity.

CAMERA TALK

land advised the use of Am print-
ing paper, not the Velox which
works too quickly for practical
purposes. By actual demonstra-
tion again, Professor Kirtland
showed just how printing is done,
and how to bring out cloud effects
in our pictures by using a

“dodger.”

At the end of the hour an enthu-
siastic audience voted for the next
lecture 'on "Indoor and Outdoor
Exposures," which will be given
April 7 in the Chemistry Room at
4: Even to those people, who
hitherto have had little interest in
photography these lectures are ab-
sorbineg interesting, so conta-
gious is Professor Kirtland's cu-
thusiasm, and so clear are his ex-
pianntions.

AN ERROR

The information in last week’s
issue that Dorothy Baehcller had
secured the position at Chevy
Chase Seminary, Washington,
D. C., is incorrect. The item was
put in without the knowledge of
the Department. The "News" re-
grcts the error.

FITZ’S FACULTY FIVE

(Continued from page 1)
Juniors last year. Larry McMahon
will take care of the other guard
position. Milne i'Iigh has two very
clever forwards this year and
faculty guards will have plenty to
do to prevent them from scoring.
Milne's center is the best man on
the team and is a consistent scorer,
but “Red” is in good condition and
should cover him effectively. Mctz-
ker and Captain Sexton are very
capable guards who will make Fitz
and Baker extend themselves to
the limit.

“Emmet” Dowling, who refereed
the Frristhilitc game last Fri—
day, will handle this game in the
same efﬁcient manner. Iioth teams
will practice hard this week and
expect to be in the best possible
shapewmn the whistle blows to
start the game.

was so exciting that they did not
have time to ask.

Milne had much the better of the
team work, but Miller and Fergn~
son overcame this by their wonder~
fui shooting. Johnson jumpng
center for Milne High and Lobdell
jumping center for the independ-
ents furnished a treat all by them-
selves, Both were in the game all
the time and each was the back~
bone of his respective team's offen~
sivc and defensive play. Johnson
is new at the game. but is very
promising. Mctzker shot fouls in
truly masterful fashion, making
seven out of eight tries. I'iloody
and 'Kirk played well, but lack the
necessary weight and experience.
Sexton, Miine’s captain, was a reg-
ular stonewall on the defense. Cas-
tellano, Bliss, and Baker played
good guarding games. This year's
team is easily the best that has
