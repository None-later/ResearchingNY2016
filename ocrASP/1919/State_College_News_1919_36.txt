OF LIFE ON SUB
CHASER

May Be Discharged Soon

A letter received from Ensign
Forrest N. Case by Prof. Douglass,
gives us some interesting news of
this cx-Senior. Mr. ("ase left Col—
lege in December, 1917, enlisting
in the Navy. His commission was
conferred early in August, 1918.

‘lr. Case hopes to be released
this spring, and to return to (,‘ol-
leee for the fall term. He is now
stationed on the U. 5. Sub Chaser
No. 20, which expects soon to
leave for duty in the North sea.
Mr. Case enclosed a picture bf this

ROOSEVELT
COMMEMORATION

Dr. fl‘h'onipson will lecture on
“Theodore Roosevelt, His Life
and \Vorks" next Friday morning

seem rather a late date for such a.
commemoration, but we trust Dr.

address that will revive all our
memories of this, our most famous

Juniors Win Championship
Sophs Put Up Stiff Fight

She is without a doubt
one of the best and cleanest play-
crs ever developed at State College.

For the second consecutive year
the Junior girls have won the in-
terclass basketball championship.
Last year it was from the Senior
team, but this year it was the
Sophomores whn disputed their
claim to the title. In the first
game, Monday, the Juniors Won by
arscore of 28 to 15. Both teams
fought hard for supremacy, but tlu
Juniors were the stronger and
won. This game spelled doom for
the Sophs, for Jessie Darling, the
clever forward, hurt her knee so
badly that she was unable to play
in the second game. The deciding
.game was a thriller frmn start to
finish, the Juniors winning by a
score of 28 to 10. Lillian Hopper,
who took Jessie Darling's place,

surprised even her own admirers

by playing a splendid game. The
real treat was the playing of Ellen

latiou, and even the Sophs are
praising her line playing. Florence
flohne, though not as spectacular
as her team mate, played a good
game and scored consistently.
Winifred Darling,r and Catherine
hall, the Soph guards, played ex-
ceediugly good games, and did
their best to stop the whirlwind
playing of their opponents. Such
playing is only typical of ‘thc
Sophs, and they can truly consider
themselves defeated, but not
beaten. The second game was
considered by those who saw it as
one of the best ever played by the
girls of State College and it gives
much promise for next year.

 

The new members were chosen
on a strict basis of merit, accord-
ing to the constitution which
governs "News" elections, deter-
mined by the records of service for
the paper.

Commencing with this issue and
continuing until May, the “News”
will be actively managed and
edited by the junior members of
the board, under the supervision of
the Senior Editors. This will con-
stitute the try—out for the senior
editor positions.

PURCHASE OF LAND
ADJACENT TO COLLEGE

Legislature Passes Bill

it is now up to Governor Smith
as to whether State College ob-
tains the land between it and the
Albany High School. A bill pro-
viding $75,000 for the 'purchase of
this land has passed the Legisla~
ture and now awaits the Governor’s
signature. ' .

It seems almost too good to be
true, to have at least the land for
our assured expansion. Ever since
State College was founded stu-
dents here have visualized several
new buildings on this lot. Repre-
sentatives of the four classes have
been to the Governor to inform
him how much We students need
and want this bill signed.
