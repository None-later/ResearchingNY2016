weakly-put-ovcr traditions. When

RUMORS, WE HOPE

.

Amusing rumors Of a coming
fashion show or model show have
been afloat about the halls for sev-
eral days. Like all rumors, these
stories have different contents, but
the general impression is that a
number of nppcrclasstnan girls
have been selected .to appear be-
fore a group of Freshmen, for the
purpose of slimviiig correct apparel
for school. street and eveniin,r wear.
At first we thought somebody was
“kidding” us into believing,r that
spring display week or the Empire
model show had moved up from
down town. lint the pcrsistcnqy
Of the rumors leads us to wonder
if there be serious consideration of
a State College gown display. '

'l‘he consenst of opinion is that
nothing quite so absurd will ever
happen. at any rate. there has been
no ollicial. public announcement to
this effect, "

  

lite scheme, as rumor
has it. would he decidedly insulting
to the Freshmen. it implies that
they are incapable of judging,r pro-
priety in dress. At least it implies
that they fail to exercise such judg-
ment.‘ While it is a decided com-
pliment to those girls who belong
to the “ chosen few." it is keenly
felt by the remainder of the Col-
lege girls as an insult to their judg—
ment. Not to be chosen implies
deﬁciency in the matter of proper
( ress.

But the worst feature of the
whole plan is that it will put State
College on the basis of a female
college. it is distinctly a “co-ed "
College, and will grow more
“co-ed” in the coming years. if
not made too etfcminate. A gown
display is proper at Vassar. W'clls-
lcy. Ml. liolyokc, and other wo-
men's colleges. but at State College
it is decidedly out of place and un-
welcome. This women's seminary
or finishing school affair is in-

consistent. with the distinctly " co-
ed” rating that our basketball
team 'has secured for us. it puts

a “ha~ha” on the men who have
played on the team.

As we said before. the fashion
Show is only a matter of rumor
tints far. and we sincerely hope
it will stay a matter of rumor, for-
ever and ever. ‘ ' -

How’s the song contest coming?
We presume cveryhotly’s busy

(J Ye Editor!

Does it seem possible that there
are in College, yea verily. even in
our College, such belughtcd crea«
turcs that they know not. the
citizen’s code of morals? ‘lt
seemeth as though the poor. nus-
guided things have no respect for
the property- rights of others.
They pay unwelcome visits to un-
locked lockers; they gently ab»
sti'act from therein such small, in—
consequential things as pocket-
books and lunches. yea—lunches!
Ln, i say unto them. how is a per—
son to live if both money and
lunch are extracted from her
pocket?

Let the guilty repent them of
their wicked ways and vow they
will sin no more. Selah'
