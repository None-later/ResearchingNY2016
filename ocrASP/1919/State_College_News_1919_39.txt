PRES. BRUBACHER

Continued from page 1
it was indeed a great privilege‘to
be able to sit at a banquet table
and so hopefully discuss an art of
peace. In closing, be praised the
pushng attitude. taken by the
President in the matter of College
athletics.

Dr. Brubachcr described the situ-
ation at the beginning of the year.
He said, "We had only 35 men at
the beginning of the season—a bril-
liant evidence of our patriotic sup-
port of the war," He then praised
the work of Coach Maroney, who
brought a victorious team out from
dark discouragement.

Speaking on the subject “The
Athletic Future of State College,"
Coach Maroney recalled the condi—
tions in 1917, when we had basket-
ball, baseball, hockey, track and
tennis. Then came the war and the
crippling of athletics. Mr. Maroncy
said that this year's success was
but the beginning of a glorious
future for State College. He proph-
esied the time when the number
of'mcn would be greater than the
number of women. He said that
only a few years hence we would
be known in intercollegiate circles
for track, football, baseball, tennis
and hockey, as well as basketball.
By way of conclusion. the coach
gave his personal testimonial of

 

The college courser

lmchcr and the‘faculty in general.
He stressed thchitLglven by the
Athletic Council, csgiecially em-
phasizing the value 0 the training
table. Lastly, he landed the spirit
and work of the men ull the team.
Dr. Brubachcr next introduced

Captain Fitzgerald of the team, who

spoke on “The College Back of
the Team.” “Fitz” praised the
support of Dr. liru‘bacbcr, Prof.
l\’isley and the Athletic Council in
every move the team has tirade.
He emphasized the immense im-
portance of the training table as
a social advantage. He mentioned
student attendance at games,
faculty attendanceat games, the
collection of the student tax', and
the cheering and support of the
College as a whole. In closing,
“li‘itz” bespoke the thanks and
appreciation: of the team for the
backing received, and for the honor
of the evening.

The next speaker, the Editor of
the “News,” Donald ’owcr. rc-

sponded with the toast “ Whatthe

Team Has Done for the College."
Among the points brought out
were, that the team made possible
the collection of the student tax,
that the team had set a splendid
example in clean sportsmanship
and sticktnitivcness in the face of
discouragement. Further than
this. the team has brought the
student body together, and has
strengthened the bonds between
students and Faculty. After Incu-
tionng the importance of the col-
leges listed on the 1918-10 sched-
ule, and after stressing the signi-
l'ieancc of the fact that State (Zol-
Icge was in a position to refuse to
join a State league, and that she
now belongs to the Eastern Inter-
collegiate league, Mr. Towner con«
cluded‘his remarks with the sum-
marizng sentence, “The team has
put State College on the map.”

Several rousing cheers for
“Prexy” and coach ended one of
the most signiﬁcant events in the
history of State College. When a
college president entertains a
group of men in honor of the Col«
leg/c team, there can be no doubt
for the future of the team and of
the College.

INTERELASS
BASKETBALL

 

Soph-lirosh game to~day, 4:40.
The much talked of intcrclass
basketball series has been started
at last and promises to be very in«
tcresting. The ﬁrst game took
place yesterday betwccn the
Seniors and Juniors. The second
game takes placc.to-day when the
Sophomore team plays the Fresh-
men. The fur is bound to lly in
this game, because the two classes
have not met in any contests yet,
and there is a lot of stored-up
energy waiting to he released. The
rivalry is keen and it is sure to
come out at this game. Both teams
are in good condition and seem
evenly matched so a lively game is
assured. On Friday afternoon the
Juniors will try to teach the Frosh
the proper method of playing, and
the Seniors will give the Sophn~
mores a few of the ﬁne points. It
Is a fight between the under". and
upper classes and only the game
itself can show which teams are
best. It will be a good chance for
the royal rootch to size up the
different teams and decide what
chance his or her team has for the
championship. The lll‘St name Fri-
day between the Juniors and Fresh«
men will start at 4 o'clock, and the
Senior-Sophomore game will fol-
low. Let everyone come out and
give some real, old cheering. On

 

the loyal support of President Bru-
