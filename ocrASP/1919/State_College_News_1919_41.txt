EDITORIALS

_ A FRESHMAN

REITERATES

All too often we hear remarks
like the one mentioned in the
“News” of last week, " isn’t this
the deadest hole you ever struck?"
and it does our *hearts good to hear
soncone say, as one Freshman did
just after assembly last Friday
morning, “You can talk about any
college you want to, but for my
part I’m glad I’m‘here. Weren’t
you proud of our classmate who
received his letter this morning?"
There was at least one representa-
tive of every class who received a
letter that morning, but how many
of us echoed the sentiments of that
Freshman? if we all felt that way,
and made such remarks more
often, we should all feel very much
more loyal in a short time. When
we expect to find a " dead holc”
here at college we make it that for
ourselves at least. if, however, we
think it a pretty good old college,
we shall ﬁnd something about us
all the time which will make us
believe it more and more. and we
shall all be saying soon, " [for my
part, I’m glad I’m here."

HOW ABOUT A MAY-DAY

 

Let's gossip about traditions
again. We have not discussed them
much lately, so in order that we
shall not forget that we have
established some “awfully” good
ones, allow me to- present for your
Inspection one that's new for
State College. This "tradition" was
proposed by an athletically—in-
clined Miss who had heard that
mostwbig colleges (women's, of
course) have a May-day every
year. So she suggested that State
College have one. How does it
strike you, collegers? What do you
do? Oh, excuse me, I’ll proceed to
explain to the best of my ability.

May-day is really a dance day.

Not the ball-room kind, but the

fancy, aesthetic kind we learn in
P. E. 3. Can you imagine anything

'pr'etticr than these fancy steps

danced in costume on'thc college
lawn? At manyof the colleges the
prettiest girl is chosen to be Queen
of the May—and State has material
galore when it comes to beauty!
It seems as though some Satur-
day afternoon in May could be'de-

 

voted to carrying out this affair,
and then how about winding up the
afternoon with-a picu c supper and
dance on the terrace? Tliis‘lnst is
suggested asa means by WhXCh'ti'le
male element of our college mi ht
MW :1 chance to disnlay 1t§ abi ty
in the art of Tcrpsichore. 1'ar be it
from us to allow jealousy to gnaw
tlic Vitals of our men, for when it
comes to dancing (other than
aesthetic) they stir the envy cf the
onlookers. And now, everybody,
do we or don't we have a real May-
say?

VOLLEY BALL

 

Now that the basket-ball season
is over we want something to take
its place. Volley ball is that some-
tliiiig. Don’t forget that there is
practice every noon at 11:45 a. 111.
A series of games will be played
between the classes just as in the
case of basket-ball. Girls, come
out for Volley Ball practice cvcry
noon so that we may have some
good teams.

ALBANY BRANCH_ OF
STATE COLLEGE ALUMNI
HOLD MEETING

 

Take Action in Regard to Alumni
Quarterly

An enthusiastic meeting of the
Albany branch of the alumni of the
State College took place in the
guilitorium of the college, March

Thc'Albany branch has a mem-
bership of more than 300 and has
pledged itself to the financing of
an alumni quarterly. The need of
such publication has long been felt
by the college. The fact that the
institution is a State college has
been rather a handicap in forma-
tion of a very active organization.
But the example of other state col—
leges and universities shows that
it can be done successfully.

The meeting was opened with
the singing of college songs. Geo.
D. Elwell was leader and Mrs.
Elwell at the iano.

Willard H, carsall, president of
the Albany branch, gave the open-
ing greeting.

Charles N. Waldron, secretary of
the Union College Alumni Associa-
tion, gave some interesting experi-
ences he has had in the formation
of the alumni association in that

‘

 

college. He said the idea of an
alumni association was distinctly
American. The same feeling,r for
one’s Alma Mater does not exist
in any of the foreign universities,
he said. The work of the associa-
tion should 'be twofold, according
to Mr. Waldron, first for the pure-

‘ly selﬁsh gratification 'of a good

time, renewing old associations
and friends; second, and more seri-
oiisly, to do‘things for the college.
The need of an official publication
to keep the members interested
ivas emphasized. The publication,
he said, should aim to be primarily
a disseminator of news. The at-
tractiveness of this paper some-
times means the making or break
ing of an organization. The prob-
lems of individual colleges vary
with given conditions but without
exception, the great problem is to
hold the interest of the members
by getting up a newsy quarterly.

r. Fiorncr, (lean of the college,
then said a few words on the prac-
tical problem of starting the pub-
lication soon. A prospectus is to
be sent to all the alumni inviting
their cooperation in the undertak—
ing.

Mrs. Edward Cameron, as chair-
man of the membership committee.
appointed a group of special work
ers. Among them are Miss Louise
Weidman, Miss Fanny Sheridan,
Miss Anna Pierce, Miss Eunicc
il’eriue, Mrs. Lester Helnics, Miss
Jessie Luck, and Miss Mary
Eddy.

There are more than 4,000 alum-
ni of the State College and the
prospects for an active and strong
organization are very bright.

SPELLING CONTEST IN
MILNE HIGH SCHOOL

Liiglish .classes of practice

SYDD-UM HALL PARTY

delightful reading, which was

closed with "The Bachelor’s Re—
verie.” Although this may sound
out of place in a girl's dormitory,
it was, nevertheless, successfully
carried out. After the program,
