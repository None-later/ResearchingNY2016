ing the year 1919—1920. Changes in
schedule will be permitted only in
cases aichting the welfare of the
student, and each case will be carc-
fuliy scrutinized by the Dean. It
is therefore urged upon each stu—
dent that he register carefully, con-
sidering his own comfort so far as
possible. For example:

a. A commuter should inform
himself about train accommoda-
tions, and take care not to regis-
ter for work at hours when he
will be unable to be at the col-
lege.

b. A student who plans to en-
gage in outside work should con-
sider the hours that will be
needed for that employment and
should not register for college
work at those hours.

7. Read these directions carefully,
observe the procedure outlined and
thus help to reduce confusion and
tiresome waiting in line to a
minimum.

STUDENT ASSEMBLY
Continued from page 1
material you have developed a
team that has met at least two of
the best teams in the State and in
the country, and has fought splen-
didly and cleanly. The team has
cemented the college together so
that it has found itself. it has been
a pleasure to be loyal to the team

you have made.

“\that these players have cx—I

hibitcd Ill clean sport, poise, speed,
lirilliau'cy, accuraney, hard light-
ing, cool nerve and team work, is an
exact picture and rellcction of your
own/position in athletics. We are
to be congratulated in having a
coach who possesses these attri-
butes, and who has the ambition
and ability to bring them out of his
men. '

“In grateful rhetzgnition of your
unselﬁsh services, the students give
you this $50 Victory Bond. A1~
though the money for this bond
was paid by the students at the be-
ginning of the college year, it is
no less spontaneous and enthusias-
tic than if it were collected yester-
day by individual subscription.

“This tribute has its signiﬁcance.

"The Victory signiﬁes the work
of the team under your direction,
and the Bond is the symbol of your

relation 'with the student body." ’
