A PROMISE. T031922
The class of nineteen twenty-one
. Wouch praise the freshmen class
"=sorbolc, '1 _.I
For. daring to make that promise
Though you’re not yet eight
month old.

 

 

Oh, we know you’re youngand
' ’ tentcr, . p

- .So. We’ll handle you With care;
But we promise you 'must go some,
.If you’ll beat this class so fun.

CHORUS
Hear those frosh ﬂesillglllg,
While our laughtcr's ringing,
’Tis the biggest joke we’ve heard
In many a day. I -
We’ve earned a Vlctor’s crown,
And you’ll be upside down
When you’re up against the Sophs
On' Moving-Up Day.

'Home Fires Burning") —'21.

I hear they had cheese at our
part '

l tell you, I don’t think its fair.
' Think-all of that good entertain-

 

ment, .
And I didn’t know it was there.
Oh, you are too slow, really Fresh-

men; ‘
You brought in your trimmings
too ate.
Don't you know you
started early,
Or awful will be your sad fate?

50 I’ve a suggestion to offer,
Which would make your stunt
‘ seem extra line.
Instead of at half past eleven,
Why not bring the cheese in at
nine?

Tell us not in boastful accents
How you stole a strip away,

Just a strip from our‘loved banner,
At the Sophomore Soiree.

All that ragged strip of crimson
Possibly to you can seem
Is a symbol, not of vict'ry,

,But the failure of your scheme.
And we're prouder of our banner
han we ever were before,

For it shows us how it always
Will withstand the test of war.

And if, all unsought by others,
It was dear unto our eyes,
When it's wanted by the Fresh—

men,
So much dearer is our prize.

' But a little word of warning,
Ere that word may be too late;
Freshmen, make no more such
blunders:
Or we tremble for your fat§.l

midable. Once someone began the
” Watch on the Rhine," hut a chair
hurled by the skillful hand of Pro-

fessor Kennedy silenced him. The,

affair ended in a basketball game
between the Odds and Evens. No
score could be kept because of the
swift pass-work of the teams and
the incomprehensible attitude of
the umpire. Before the crowd
went home the' air was blue——
Camels! Some fellows enjoyed the
more gentle arts of howling (bas-
ket balls and Indian clubs) and
fencing (wands). A ﬁnal sing sent

It is seldom that State College
has an opportunity to hear two
such distinguished artists. A large
audience bespoke the appreciation

Mrs. Crahshaw—“W'by do they
have that awful bass drum in the
band?”
Crabshaw—J‘ it’s all for the best,
my dear. If it wasn’t for the drum
you’d hear the other pieces.”

 

A fellow said to a famous sprint-
er, “ [’ll race you and beat you if
you'll let me choose the course and
give me a yard’s headstart."
“Fifty dollars to one that you
don't," said the sprinter confident-
ly; "name your course.“

longer.

A Matter of Taste
There was a young lady called Ida,
Who said she just loved apple cida,
But when a small sip
Of champagne wet her lip,
Her mouth opened wida and wida.

 

A Little Hint

Janet, aged nine, was taken by
her mother to lunch at the house
of a friend.

The hostess was of a talkative
variety, and, in her enjoyment of
certain interesting little incidents
she was relating, quite forgot to
give Janet anything in the shape of

After a lapse of several minutes,
Janet could endure the situation
no longer. So raising her plate as
high as she could, she demanded
in a shrill voice:

“Anybody 'hcrc want a clean
plate?”

“Have you a warning signal on
the front of your car?"

“ Yes, i have a little round thing
that says 'Dmlgc Brothers!"

“ l-lcr teeth are like stars." gushed
the love-smitten youth,

in a murmur ofjoyous delight.

And when they were married he
found 'twas the truth,

For, like stars. they came out
every night.

What's the Use?

“icon and you’re called a baby,

Laugh and you’re called a fool.

Yield and you‘re called a coward,
Stand and you’re called a mule,

Smile and they’ll call you silly,
Frown and they’ll call you gruff,

Put on a front like a millionaire
And some guy calls your bluff.

 

Changed in Transit ,

One of the methods of communi-
cating from oneo cer to another
in the trenches. was to give the
message to one of the privates and
tell him to “pass the word along”
‘the line until it reached its destina-
tion—the ofﬁcer at the other end.
The following story will Show how
a serious message can be distorted
on its journey from' mouth to
mouth:

Lieutenant Doc, in charge of one
end of the British line, told the
private in front to "pass the word
along” to Lieutenant 13.: “ We are
going to advance. . Can you send
us reinforcements?"

\Vhen Lieutenant B. received the
message it was like this: “We are
going to a dance. Can you send us
three and four-pence?" ‘
