The program began with marching
tactics by the Sophomores and
Freshmen. The next number was
a wand and dumb-bell drill. This
drill was made very effective, by ar-
ranging the dumb<bells and wands

dances. “Varsauvieune." Illlt "
.llnups." by the I: 'Tlllllt‘tl and
Sophomores were well received.
An Indian club drill followed the
datn‘es. I’erhaps the most Ct'jtty-
able event on the program was the
military l' ' s by teen girls.
Jesse Darling. 'Zl, aLt as top
sergeant, and lillen Douohue. ’30,
and Nellie l’arkhurst "’ were
l'l)l‘|)t.lt‘(tl.'i. The girls shout-d quick
response to the commands. and
their lllttl‘t‘ltlll!’ was highly coin-
nictulable.

Following, this was an athletic
llru dance by the Soplioinoi ..
The next llttlltlit't' was apparatus
work. The work done on the

parallel bars by the women and on .

the long horse by tlte men showed
evidences of much practice. Aes-
