EDITORIALS
THE OLD AND THE NEW

 

  

With this issue of the “State
College News" the new lloard of
Editors tacos office for tlte re-
mainder of the year, and for the
year 1919-20. The publication of
tlte big issue will ch lllt' term of
other: of the outgoing senior board.

The Seniors who are leaving be-
hian the work of the “ News" to
the newly-elected juniors, wish to
thank the student hotly for tlte
hearty support and assistance given
to us during the ye: . ‘. have
tried to make the “ News" wurtlty
of our great college, and if our
efforts have succeeded, it is be-
cause the student body has stood

 

   

)y us.

In addition, we wish to hespeak
the same spirit of cooperation for
the new board of editors. Through
constant and excellent labor
throughout the year these people
have won their new position on
the board. Strict records have
been kept, and positions were
awarded according to merit. The
College is indeed fortunate to have
in charge of its student publication
such loyal and splendidly equipped
people. The College must and will
:sttplmrt the new board.

Welcome, New lloard! Success
to you! Student Body, we say
again “Thank you” then adios!

The ’19 Members of the Board
of Editors.

A THOUGHT

 

"Isn’t it a grand and glorious
feeling?" We're almost there, all
of us. l’rosh won't be so verdant,
Soplts will have attained the right
to he called upp‘erclassmen, Juniors
will be grand old Seniors doing
practice teaching, and the class of
1919 will have become historv.
Isn't it tragic, in a way? The as-
sumption of new responsibilities,
the divinity of heretofore hidden
secrets, the achievement of stip—
poscdly impossible problems—all
those coming to pass in just a few
weeks. Things have fairly flown
alum: this year; perhaps. an ac-
count of the first semester, per-
Imps, on account of world affairs
of huge dimensions which are rush-
ing along with such strides, or
maybe our appreciation of overv—

Soon it will he Moving-Up Day,
then finals, then Commoncement. a
brief respite, and we return to our
chosen labors again; to the making
of new friends, we hope. We shall
miss 191.9 and the faculty members
who are not to return. To them
we shall extend all good wishes for
the best of success, and to those
who are entering we shall tender a
hearty welcome. Thus we meet,
forget, and renew friendships as we

pass along life's highway.
