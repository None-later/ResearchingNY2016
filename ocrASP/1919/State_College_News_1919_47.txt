.\ meetingr oi Newman (fluh was
held Monday. The husiuess was
the uontina ton of ofﬁcer. ‘
of the eandidates will he pos '
the litlllelltl hoard durini,Ir the Week,
and the election will take place in
the rotunda lt‘riday. Don’t forget
to vote!

:\t'ter nominations, Father
lluuuey gave a very interesting lee-
ture on “ Spiritisin." llc presented
the historical background of the
movement, starting with the l'lahy~
lonia ' ltl t1‘:lt‘lttl.': the eourse, to
the Spiritisni ot' to»day. He stated
the attitude of the Catholic church
on the subject, and showed how
consistent its stand has been.

HOW ABOUT A FRESH-
MAN SING?

Since College is so near over and
Moving-Up Day is coming so soon,
it will he only a short time that we
are still Freshmen. Don’t you
think we should get together and
have a good sing? it is an estab-
lished fact that we are all excel-
lent singers and don’t need any
practise at all to be able to drown
out the entire College, but it would
he rather pleasant to meet and have
a good time singing.

The Juniors and Sophomores
have both had their sings and we
can’t fall far out of the right path if
we follow closely in their footsteps
as“ all good children should. ’22.
