‘A'I‘E COLLEGE NEWS,

MILDRED McEWAN ]
BELIEVE!) DROWNED ,

Popular 1913 Girl 'Ehought To Be
Victim of Accident

State College was shocked Mon-
day to hear that Miss Mildred
Lippet McEwau is believed to be
drowned. Up to the time of go-
inp; to press no news of the finding
of bodies leads authorities to thin
that Miss MeEwan is drowned.

.~\cemnp.’n‘tied by a young lien-
tenant, Miss McEwan starter! rm
a canoe trip up Dtsego Lake last
Saturday. Late that afternoon an
overturned canoe, later identiﬁed
as ‘Ilt'l’ own. was found drifting.r on
the lake. Subsequent investigation
located the place where the. two
young people had landed and
started to prepare lunch. it is be-
lieved that aeroplane manoeuvres
over the lake induced Miss Mt‘~
Ewan and her companion to pad-
dle out on the lake in order better
to watch the aeroplanes. and that
lhc canoe overturned. Although
Miss Meliwan was a good swim~
mer. the cold water doubtless crip-
pIt-d hcr attempts to save herself.

Miss Mclflwan will be remem—
bered by all upperclassmen as
'Iillie.” She was graduated last;
June and during her four years
here was considered extremely
brilliant and popular. ' was one
of the founders of the ' ate (Viol—
