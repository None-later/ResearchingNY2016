Faith and Works

One Monday morting two little
girls, aged seven and nine, were on
their way to school. Fearing they
would he tardy. the seven-year-old
said to the nine—year-old: ” Let’s
kneel down and pray that we won‘t
be late."

The nine-year-old said to the
seven-year-old: “ Let’s keep on
hiking and pray as we hike!“

  

Better the First Time

A man asked a friend who was
hard of hearing if he would lend
him IlVC dollars.

“ What?” asked the friend.
“Will you lend me ten dollars?"
“ h, yes," replied the friend,
“but I wish now I had heard you
the ﬁrst time!”

And Then No One Spoke
"Pa,"?said little Willie, "what's

an echo.’

"An echo, my son,“ answered his

father, casting a Side glance at
Willie’s mother, “ is the only thing
on earth that can cheat a woman
out 0f~her last word!”

“Another definition of an CCIIO,
Willie,” observed his mother, “is
a man who goes to old patent-
mcrlli'eine alinanaes for his alleged
Wit.

Had Been There

“I once knew a man who went
hungry in order to buy feed for his
horse,” sai Jones.

“I can understand his senti-
ments," said Smith. “Mauy's the
time I have cut down on meat and
potatoes in order to luiy gasoline."

Back Again

Isaac wished to consult a physi—
cian and asked a friend to recom—
mend one.

"And what does he charge?"
asked Isaac, making.r a note of the
doctor's name.

“Five dollars for the first visit.
three dollars for sueeceding calls,"
was the reply.

Half an hour later lsaac entered
the physician’s ofﬁce and gave this
greeting: “Good morning, doctor.
i’xu back again.”

“Are you sure it does?”

“ch, lady; get right on.”

“lint it says ‘Aslimont and Mil—
ton’ on the side.”

“We ain't; going sideways, lady;
get right on."

Not that Kind I

“Gi‘iggs and his wife are not get.
tint,r along very smoothly, i hear,"

Beats the Hen

Two men were hotly discussing
the merits of a book. Finally one
of them, himself an author, said
to the other:

“No, John, you can't appreciate
it. You never wrote a book your-
self.”

“No,” retorted John, "and i
never laid an egg, but i’m a better
judge of an omelet; than any hen."

Not Keen About It

"My, but you will be glad when
your time is up, won’t you?” said
a sweet nineteen-year-old miss to
a. prisoner in jail, r

‘ can’t say I'm very keen about
it, Miss,” was the Answer. "l‘m in
for life.”

A little present
Home to the missus
She will not think
You are trying
To cover up a crime
With it.
