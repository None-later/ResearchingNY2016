EDITORIALS
LAST YEAR

Last ycur we were only Sopho—
mores, to hc sure. and wc lost the
banner rush. hut what a Wonderful
time we had. The ycar hcinrc
when we u'crc l’rnsh. " Moving—tip
Day” hadn't mcant \'cry lunch to
its. Perhaps it was the rain or
pcrhaps it was just hccuusc we
hadn't lmcu hcrc long enough yet
to appreciatc what “ Moving-up
Day" really means. This ycnr
wc'rc hcgiuning, just now, to
realizc a little Inorc what it. means
to develop suddenly from unc class
to .anothcr. Our memories ul last
year and the year liclurc arc all
the sweeter now that another rcd-
letter day is nearly hch. \Vc'vc
bccn praying for weeks for
weather like May, l918. and we're
sure our prayers will hc answcrcd.
'-We have only one more stcp to
‘ta'kt-thc longest. and most dith-
lcult oi all—hetorc wc'll hc “out
-ou .0qu own." To think of nor haw
ing with us those very good friends
of 1919 is not pleasant. Wc must
work hard to equal their achicvc-
mcnts. but we have contidcuc‘ and
lmpc to be their cnuals or nmyhe,
thcir hcttcrs. Who knows?

The traditions of college days
liL‘COll'lC dearer when. even a taint
reminder of how soon thcy will he
but lilClllUFlCn' come to us. 'c
must always kcep them fresh and
ncur to us when we have become
“grand old Scuiors" and ulti~
matcly passed out into " the wide,
wide worlr."

Can we forget either of our pre-
vious “Moving—up Days?" The
ﬁrst one held in the gym when
“ Bcalc’s" brass hand made its
dchut? 0r last year’s second rush
the night before. when '21 hccamc
victorious by about tcn feet of
chimney and pole?

‘his year we are to be but up-
prcciative onlookers at thc rush.
hut " Moving-up Day " we will he-
gin to assume our importance and
dignity and to wear our Stalc Col-
lcgc seals. ’c will he no longcr
juniors, hut Seniors of the class of
1920.

’21, DO YOU REMEMBER?

 

Well, ’21. how do we feel about
it?

Just great! lint then why
shouldn’t wc.

Just rcllcct a fcw moments——
lirst on last year's banner rush the
night hct‘orc “Moving—up Day,"
then on the splendid way in which
’21 showed up in thc athlclic events
at lx’idgclicld "ark, and lastly on
thc titlingr way in which we cuded
our " Pcrlcct Day” hy winning thc
inter-class sing at night!

Doesn‘t il just thrill you to think
of what we have donc? And
doesn't it till you hrim-full oi cn<
thus 15m to do as much and morc
twilight and to-inorrmv?

Do you rcmcmhcr the splendid
spirit of our s stcr class ’l9? Can
any of us ever nrget that? '19 '21—
what do those numerals not recall?
‘19, the hcst sistcr that ’2l or any
uthcr class could crct‘ hopc to
have.

them? lla\cu't they always hccu

TO A FRESHMAN

:\s a Freshman the thoughts nt'
" .\lnving-up Day " arc \‘cry strangc
indccd. 'l‘hcy arc mingled with :1

 

it 'np,‘ ul woudcr as to what is
really going to happen and a tool—
int: n!" rcnt cxcncmcut. Just slop

   

to think that on that \voudcrlul
day \\'(' won't hc rcnl lirnsh any
longer. it will he thc dawn of :t
iu-w day when we can go in and
out the front dr-or without glan 'iug
around to scc if someone is watch
iug.r us. Wc can hcniu to plan how
we will llrit' thc littlu l’rosh who
will arrivc next fall.' :arcd and
just as green as wc \Vt‘rc.

Wc look lorwurd tn " Moving—up
Day ” with a little sndncss tun. Wc
hate to think that thi ' will
change and won't always hc thc
s; nu as whcu wc \Vcrc II‘rosh. \Vc
iatc tn scc the Scuinrs lcarc us and
an out into the “ widc. widc n'nrld."
(in the whole they htth hucu vcry

;\'c 'thclcss. with thc expccta-
tinu of u tin-l time uppcrmnst in
