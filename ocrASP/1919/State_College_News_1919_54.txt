STATE COLLEGE NEWS, MAY 17, 1919

KEEP THE FAITH

The realization here at College
that conditions are gradually re-
turning lo something like normal
ought to remind us of how such a
thing has been made possible. We
may think it's all'ovcr, now that
peace terms are being prepared,
and some of our own boys are
home. Just to know that these
things are happening and better
things promising ought to be
enough to make us sacriﬁce a little
more to insure prompt and calm
pletc action.

There are some million and a
half donghboys still across the
pond who are just as anxious to
get back home as our boys were.
it costs money to keep them there
or to bring them home, and we
are the ones who must help supply
it. We've done our bits in supply-
ing men, women, and funds for
previous emergencies, and We must
not fall down here.

Just feeling thankful that the
worst is over and better times
coming isn’t enough at this stage of
the game. We must assure our
representatives, both overseas and
in the home camps, that we're
back of them, up reciativc of all
they have done. Vc also have to
realize at the same time what a
narrow margin between wages and
living expenses there now is. On
the other hand, put yourself in a
returning Sammy’s place—glad to
be home, expectant of some help
according to our promises before
the war was won, but out of a job,
and desirous of a little rest, per-
haps. We simply must pinch our‘
selves awake to necessity and then
pinch our pocketbooks to round
up enough for one more bond.

it has never bccn'quitc deﬁnitely
decided whether necessity or lux-
ury is the mother of invention. It
doesn't matter in this case because
the inventing has to be done rc-
gardless of who the ori inators of
necessity may be. We lich a rep-
utation; we must retain and in«
crease its magnitude if possible.

“Keep the Faith" is an apropos
slogan for this, our Victory Loan,
as it signiﬁes our faith in our men
in service and should insure them
of our intentions in regard to their
future welfare. We must buy bonds
to bring our boys back!

 

OUR SIX GOLD STARS

Of the two hundred stars in our
scrviceflag, representinl service
in army, navy, marines, .M. C. A.
and Y. C. A. canteen work, six
have been change to gold stars—a
silent remembrance that six brave
men of State College gave their
all. While the loss of these men
is surely felt, the sadness of the
fact is lightened by the knowledge
that they made the supreme sacri-
ﬁcc willingly and gladly, and by
our pride that our own Alma
Mater gave freely to her fullest
cxlcnt.

As each star was added, the sc~
riuusncss of the situation im-
pressed itself upon the College
more and more. Everywhere the
sadness was accompanied by a
given determination to ﬁght
harder, to work more nnccasingly
than ever, in order to bring about
the eventual victory. The spirit
of the beautiful poem, "in Flau-
dcrs Fields," served to grow
stronger and stronger as gold star
after gold star appeared, As i
to asster the dead that the. living
would “carry on,” and that their
sacriﬁce should not he in vain. the
College increased and magniﬁed
her efforts toward scrviCc.‘ Red

College answered the challenge.
To the right of the main en»
trance hangs a bronze tablet cum-
memorating the men who fought
or fell from 1861 to 1865. The stu-
dent body has purchased an en-
graved honor roll which will serve
to conunemoratc the veterans of
l914-lti, until the list is absolutely
complete and correct, when a more
lilting memorial can be secured.

ABOUT ERRORS

it is a simple law of human na-
ture that human beings make this»
takes. Thus it is not strange that
errors are. found in the columns of
the "State College News.” Some-
times they result from misinforuut-
lion, sonic-titties through fault of the
prooircadcra, and sometimes through
the fault of the printers. Whatever
the cause, errors are most certainly
not intentional.

ltcucntly a grave error resulted in
the omission of the name of one o
the candidates for Senior President.
Immediately the blame was placed
against the other candidate, or
charged to fraternity politics. in
spite of the fact that public an-
nouncemcnt that the error was
purely typographical was made in
Student Assembly and Junior
Class Meeting, a few willful scan-
del-mrmgcrs still accuse the above
named parties.

The character of the accnsml
persons should make further words
concerning the matter unneces-
sary, However, the “News” wishes
thus publicly to state that this
error was purely accidental and
that personal influences and par«
flSitllhllip of any sort can NEVER
be used for a purpose of this kind
in the “State College News."

To the Editor:

Alfred Milli-r, L'X-’l9, deserves
worthy mention in our columns.
lie is meeting with marked suc-
cess at St. Mark’s Episcopal
Church, Philmout. New York,
where he is now located. it was
with great pleasure that i listened
to his two sermons delivered on
Easter Sunday. He has won the
conﬁdence and love of his laymen
through his talent and personality.

work being done by one of her
members. Through the "News"
we extend "Al" our sincerest wish
for his future success.
