THE STUDENT TAX

.\u innovation at State. (ltlllﬁ'gc
last year was the student ltl;llll(t,‘l
tax, (to October lst each student
eot..i'ilntte.d a sum to a general
fund. which used to covrr
the expert: the col-
lege ptthl , including,r the
"Quarterly," the “State (.ollege
Ix. its, the. t’olltzgu weekly, and
miter college projects.

The fact, that every student paid
his amount into th s fund of vol-
untary taxes is sitllitient proof that
the student tax is an institution
whirl! hit) come to stay. Further
more, the students have been well
pleased with the results of the tax.
:\ll|lt'llt7.’i, especially haskethall,
hare heeu earried on in a manner
which would not have been pm

it'r'eivt'd copies of the Quarterly "

Nothing else has ever hut-n such

usual advantages to those coming
to State College, not only from the
educational httt "r, from the so-
ti and commercial standpoint.
Around its name cluster traditions
a~ old as the country itself. Quaint
hnildings depict its early history
as a Dutch city.

To students of State College,
Alhany gives freely. .\'o place of
interrst or value is denied them.
First of interest comes the Educa-
tion ltttildiug where is found one
of the largest reference libraries
in the country, the periodical
rot-tn, the law, medical and legis-
lativr lihraries. Here, too, is the
State Museum which cannot be ex-
llt'tl in its collections. Of espe-
t interest are the lndian groups
