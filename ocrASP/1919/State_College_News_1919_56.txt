STATE COLLEGE NEWS, MAY 17, 1919’

STA TE COLLEGE HAS AN UN.
’USUAL YEA £91 BASKE TBA LL

State College had decided, to-
gether with the other leading col-
icges and ui‘iiversitics of the coun-
try, to attempt no organized ath-
letics. In fact, there was nothing
else to he done. Practically every
athlete of the College was engaged
in the greatest game of all. But
when the armistice was signed by
the belligerent nations, every col-
lege was confronted with the same
question, "What can we do with
athletics this year?"

What State College (lid in the
sport then in season can be seen
in the space devoted to statistics.
With scarcely forty men left to
worﬁflor her, she enteer the col-
legiate basketball world to strive
for victory against teams repre-
senting colleges whose enrollment
was often ten times as great. The
victories achieved would have been
a credit to the biggest college in
the country. To gain victory in
college basketball means to have
the three elements of the team
working in unison, the coach, the
team, and the scrubs,

The Coach

Arthur C. Maroney has by his
work with the Purple Quintet,
built up a reputation as a first class
college coach. For him it was
work, work, work, from the time
the squad first reported until the
whistle blew for the last time at
the Hamilton game. l’ive nights
out of the week he was coaching
his men, urging, illustrating, driv-

mettle of his boys on the court,

above all, in the clean. sportsman-

Captain Fitzgerald. for four
years played a type of college has-
ketball to be envied by any man
interested in the game. in the two
years of his captaincy he proved
himself beyond a doubt. the fastest
forward in the East. With his
speed he has combined a remark-
able cleverness in shooting. light-
ningvlike passwork, unusual cool-
ness in tight places; his clean fast

that is not enough to show .1161“
high appreciation for the Little
Captain.
Curt
Another man who has played his
last game for the l’urple and Gold
is Curtin, the grand old guard of
State College. in the two years
(lilting which he lhad played with
the Varsity. it can be stated that
his man never got by him. We
will always remember him as he
appeared when he broke up the
Syracuse passwork at the end of
that game. Vith a minute to play
the Wes-tern players Were holding
the ball under our basket. Then
Curt went in. Slowly. on his toes,
shoulders high, head low—the dan«
gcr signal. it was his lighting at—
titude, the attitude that always got
results—and the ball.
Barry
State College does not boast of
her men; she shows records and
lets one judge from them. Rec-
ords show that "Marty" Barry is

ranked among the cleverest for—
wards of the country, being first
among those of the East. Though
not so fast on his feet as his part<
nor, with other forwards of the
Empire State. he compares most
favorably. it is his shooting which
gained him renown as the Minia-
ture Forward. There was no shot
too difficult for 'him to try; and.
with due credit to other players of
the country, there is probably no

 

forward of his time who has made
so many difficult shots. In fact,
there is one so decidedly original
that we speak of it as "Barry’s
Own." 1n him We have a litting
cantain for next year‘s squad.

“Flip”

Holy Cross lost a most capable
player when “Flip” Dowliug came
to State. At the pivot position he
tapped the hall almost at will to
his mate. In the passwork his
presence was more than notice<
able. Iiis clever overhead shot
has helped to put more than a few
games in cold storage, since it is
impossible to interfere with it,
once it has started on its journey.

his senior year he will undoubtedly
captain the f'urplc and Gold.

The Scrubs

Although they had no opportu-
nity to display their mettle on the
court, the Scrubs deserve much of
praise and honor. Their steady
work and rapid development as-
sures us that there will be plenty
of material for next year's team.
These men are: Ralph Baker,
Wade Miller, Arthur Ferguson,
Samuel Lichtenstein, Thomas Cas-

,tellano and Edwin Nicholson.

INTER-CLASS RIVALRY

The men at State, though few in
numbers in comparison with the
opposite sex, do not lack in pen
and rleviltry. From the very first
of the year the Freshman and
Sophomores start a good natured
rivalry, which continues until the
supremacy is finally settled on
Moving-up Day in the spring.

When the Fresh enter in the
fall they are requested (i) to wear
buttons and follow the rules in the
"Bible" presented them. Woe to
the one who rlis‘ol)cys and is
caught!

A little later the basketball sea-
son begins and then there are
many battles royal for the winning
of the championship. An attempt
of each class to “cop” the banner
of the rival is the chief point of
contention,

The deciding contest comes on
Moving-up Day at the athletic
ﬁeld, when the fellows participate
in'various events, with a baseball
game as the wind-up. Then, in
the evening, at 1:110 step-sing, the
judges announce the winners of
class rivalry.
