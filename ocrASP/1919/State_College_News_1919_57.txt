IN TER-CLASS BASKETBALL

Juniors Win Championship For
The Third Time

Although the games were played
after the regular season was over.
the inter-class scrie this year was
one of tlte bt-st series of class
games ever lteld in State College.
On paper the teatns seemed evenly
ntatched and for once the dopesters
were right. livery team was as
good as the others, and ottly tlte
breaks of tlte gatne gave the juniors
the championship. in the case of
the first Junior-Senior game the
Seniors made two more baskets
that! their younger fellow students,
but Merchant’s foul-shooting won
the game. in this game he shot
eight fouls out of nine. [11 all the
rest of the games Merchant’s play-
ing and sltooting kept tlte Junior
team in the lighting. and ﬁnally. in
the last game to decide the chant-
pionship. his foul—shooting again
defeated the ﬁghting Settlers.
“Red” Sutherland. '19. the track
star. was a consistent point gather-
er for the Seniors, and his all-
round defensive playing was a con~
staut menace to the other teams.

Maroney is lucky to have such
promising material for next year's
squad. The Freshmen lost to the
Sophs by a score of 18 to l5. but
came back the next game and beat
the Juniors iii an overtime game,
when Brown shot a basket front the
middle of the floor. The score was
22—21. in the next game they fell
before the strong Senior team in
another overtime game by a score
of 19 to IS

The Sophs were represented by
“Shorty” [-lathorn. linker. Bliss.
Bruce, Bttcci and Brody. After
beating the Freshmen they tell be-
fore the Seniors to the tune of 16-
14, and were defeated by the Inn-
iors by a score of 20-17 without the
services of " ltorty" lfathorne.
“Shorty” and “ Bak " were the big
guns for the Sophs and both
showed good grit and plenty of
talent and ability.

The Juniors were represented by
Merchant. Ferguson. Hoffman,
McMahon and Wellwortlt. This
team was well balattced. Merchant.
Ferguson and Wellworth fortned
the most powerful scoring machine
in the league, and worked the ball
no the floor for baskets time and
again. Wellworth was entirely too
fast for the opponents' guards. and
broke up several games with his
shots. He had a way of coming
tltrtt with his baskets just when it
looked darkest for the Juniors, and

 

iii the lilltlll Junior-Senior game lte
dribbled the ball the entire length
of the court twice. putting the Jun-
iors in front each time. McMahnu
and Hoffman cornered their tneu
effectively and it was their splendid
guarding that enabled the juniors
to will the championship.

The Seniors individually were
the best players. but they lacked
the team work which is necessary
for a championship team. even itt
class contests, ” lx'etl " Sutherland.
Costellano attd Cltessen played
good basket ball and passed the
ball around, but [’argot attd Lich-
enstciu resorted to individual tac-
tics.

This is the third consecutive
time that the Juniors have won the
champimtship. Though they have
lost mctt from the team each year,
they always managed to “ eop “ the
the pennant. Ed. Springman is
largely responsible for the success
of the team. for in the ﬁrst two
years his playing was the feature
of the games. This year he only
coached and advised. but the well-
balanced team and the display of
aggressive and unselfish team-work
can be traced back to Ed.

Coach Maroncy and Dr. Powers
ofﬁciated in the most satisfactory
manner. They handled the games
very ellieiently and kept the cou-
test fast. clean and interesting.
About three htmdred students saw
each game and the faculty were al-
so well represented. Professor Kitt-
land was the ofﬁcial scorer and Mr.
Deyo was official timer, wltile
President llrubaeher and many
other members of the faculty
watched the games with keen inter-
est. All were neutral except Pro-
fessor Rislcy. who was kept busy
going from one section to another
He believes in rooting for the los«
ittg team, bttt declares it is very in—
convenient.

 

Ft'om every point of view the
series was most gratifying and suc-
cessful. Clean. etlost‘ly contested
games were the rule. These games.
which testetl the gamencss and
sportsmanship of the men. showed
clearly that State men are made of
of the right stuff. The enthusiasm
and good-natured rivalry between
the several classes never sltowerl
up to better advantage.
