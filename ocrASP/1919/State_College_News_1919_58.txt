the incomng classes for the next
two years. in recent years. ath—
lctics have won a place of more or
less prominence among the e'irls.
so much so in fact, that a real cri«
sis in the field is now recognized
by lovers of the College—either
the new classes will be allowed to
slip down and the place athletics
'has be lost. The fact that a lull
four years’ course in physiral edu—
cation has been introduced at the
College is attracting the attention

schools of the State will lead fur-
ther to havng athletic leaders
among the personnel of the ('ol-
loge.

lctics is an iutcrclass basketball
tournament 'held during,r the winter
months on the indoor court. Two
games are played between each
