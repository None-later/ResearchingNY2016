THE

STATE COLLEGE NEWS, MAY 17, 1919

STA TE COLLEGE DURING

WAR

 

 

S. A. T. C. Barracks

As in every institution of our
country, both public and private,
State College underwent great
changes during the war. The big
Freshman class of 1916 had given
great promise of the spread of our
alulnni, the increase in our build-
ings and subsequent rating as a
college. The following September
the entering class lacked some two
hundred members of reaching the
record of the year before. bring-
ing our total registration down to
eight hundred. This year, l9 8-
lOl‘), has seen our ll even less
well-lilled, the registration being
less than seven hundred. Despite
this fact the past year has been the
most successful in many ways, and
with men returning every week.
we hope our numbers will be in-
creased next September beyond
the farthest expectations.

lletween the outbreak of the war
in April. 1917, and the signing of
the armistice, November ll. 8,
State College. contributed 159 men
to active military service, besides
several nurses and war workers.
Of this number six gave their
lives. We are proud to publish
their names here as we know they
were glad and willing to make the
supreme sacriﬁce. ur six gold
stars are forlidward Francis Pot-
ter, ’lS; Raymond Oscar Ludwig,
'20; Frank Bronk Story, ’21; James
Oran Johnson, ’2]; Earl John Van
l'loosen, '22, and Raymond Temple
Clapp, graduate student, ’

Here at College some seven
hundred men were trained for
transfer to ofﬁcers' camps. The
men consisted of two groups, sec-
tion A. comprising 110 students
from Albany Law School and
State College, and section B con-
sistin" of some six hundred drafted

 

 

men. There were twelve officers
in charge. The commandant from
June to October 1918. was Captain
IE. L. Reid,'and from November
l9l8, to January 1919. Captain
Harris D. Rush. The other offi-
cers were First Lieut. Arnold J,
Grant, First Limit. Lemuel J. Cod~
by, medical ofﬁcer; l’irst Lieut.
Joseph 'I‘. l‘latnpel. dental ofﬁcer;
First Lient. Charles R. VVaruer.
l’irst Lient. Timothy E. Wood:
ward. quartermaster; Second
Lieut. Frank E. Gnebelin, Second
Licut. Dewey R. Fortune, Second
Lielrt. Edwin F. Hannon, Second
Lient. \Valter C. Fielder, Secoan
Lieut. Samuel E. Knighton.

All the facilities of State Col-
lege were placed at the disposal of
the War Department. During the
summer the College Cafeteria was
used as mess hall and the Albany
High School gymnasium for bar-
racks. later a permanent mess
ball and permanent barracks were
built on the ground between the

ollcge and High School, ficvet'«
wka Park was used as drill field.
The garage in l'ludson Avenue
was used for training in motor re<
pair, wireless and signal work. lie-
fore the permanent barracks were
completed, section A used the Col-
lege gymnasium. Sprague chapel
in \Vashington avenue made an ex-
cellent hospital, where section A
men were in charge under First
Lieut. L. J. Godby. Several
nurses donated their services. The.
men of section A were inducted
into service on October lst. They
were discharged December 4th.
and nearly all returned to their
studies the second semester. Since
then men who were in other
branches of the service have been
coming back one or two at a time,

 

 

Inauguration of the S. A. T. C.

 

until now conditions resembling
normal exist. Credit was granted
to returning students for the first
semester's work on the basis of
previous attendance and scholar-
ship at College. The members of
the S. \ 'l‘. C. were able in some
degree to carry on their regular
schedules. During their training
they were divided into three
groups. according to age: twenty,
nineteen and eighteen years old.
The first group was scheduled for
transfer to active service on or
before January lst, 19l9, the‘ see—
oud for April lst. and the third
for July lst. Instruction in war
issues. hygiene and sanitation. to—
pography and surveying, military
law and practice, and a choice be-
tween lirene'li. physics, chemistry
and nuttheinaties was given.

State ('ollege is proud of her
number of commissioned ollicers,
t\vent.y~eiglrt', including one fac-
ulty member, Claude M. llnbbard.
past physical instructor. She is
also very proud of the tremendous
response made to every appeal to
purse and energy. Red Cross
6 ses have proved highly suc-
eessful and are still continuing their
work.

During this period of change
and stress State College has strug-
gled along, hopeful for better and
fuller years. She has been proud
and willing to do her war work but
is now anxious to “carry on” her
peace activities.
