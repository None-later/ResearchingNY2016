MYSKANIA

 

One of the most important steps
in the development of student spirit
and power was the organization,
in March, 1917, of a Student Conn-

Cl .

The purpose of the Council is to
serve as a means of communication
between the students and the fac-
uity. It is an honorary body, com-

posed of not more than twelve nor ,

less than ten Senior members who
have won places of prominence in
scholarship. athletics or other col-
lege activities, and who have capac-
ity for leadershi . The members
are elected as fol ows: The faculty
appoints five juniors before the
spring recess of each year; the out~
going Council adds five, six or
seven of this number. The presi-
dent of the senior cla becomes a
member ex-ol’ﬁcio, if he is not one
before election to the class presi~
dency. The duties and privileges of
the Student Council are: To have
seats upon the platform at student
assemblies: to govern interclass
contests, other than athletic; to ad--
minister the rules governing the
various competitions for ofﬁces: to
administer the college customs;
to control fraternity and sorority
nracticcs: to call the Freshmen
Class meeting for electing ofﬁcers:
to govern all class elections; and
to make recommemlatious to the
student assembly.

e 1919 members are: Harriet
f‘burch, Agnes Dennin, Francis
Fitzgerald. Caroline Lipes. Doro—
thy Roberts, Gertrude Schermer-

 

horn. Earle Sutherland. Donald'

Tower. Lyra Waterhouse, Winifred

OMICRON NU

 

 

Omicron Nu is a national honor-
ary society. organized for the pro-
motion of home economics. Only
juniors and seniors who have at-
tained at high standing in courses
leading to a college degree are eli~
gible. The promise of future
achievement after leaving college,
as indicated by the scholarship,
personality, and attitude of each
student. during the college course,
is a determining factor in the elec-
tion to membership.

The past year has been one of
growth to Beta chapter at State
College. As a climax to the activ-
ities, the Fourth Annual Conclave
will be held at State College, June

19, 20, 21. lx’eprcsentativcs will be
present from chapters in lndiana.
Ohio, iowa, Nebraska, Michigan.
Wisconsin, New York, Oklahoma,
and Florida.

The members of Omicron Nu for
the year 1919-20 are: Ruth Weir,
Margery Edgarton. Emily Hamil-
ton. Mildred Wellcr. l

uring the preceding year there
have been live petitions for new
chapters: Cornell, Florida State,

gan State.

THE DRAMATICS AND
ART ASSOCIATION

 

For some time there has been a
Dramaties Class at State College,
which produced usually two plays
each year. Composed of a small
number of students, it has done its
work as part of the college curri-
cuhnn. During the ﬁrst seinester
this year the class presented, under
the direction of Miss Agnes Fut-
tercr, tbrec one-act plays. "The
Rescue.” “The Neighbors," and
“The Maker of Dreams." Recent-
IV a need has been felt to open the
field to those whose programs do
not permit of dramatics as a course
but who are interested in the work
for its own sake.

With this idea in mind the. Dra~
matics and Art Association has
been formed. with Miss butterer
and Miss Eunice A. Pcrine as ad—
visors. it is to be closely con—
nected with student activities. will
be governed by an advisory council
of facultv and students. and will
have a status similar to that of the
Athletic Association. The two dc-
partments of Art and Dramatics
are working together, feeling that
they have some interests in com-
mon. The art students will study
stage effects and help in the scen-
crv and stage-setting.

Each year the association plans
to produce two plays as hereto-
fore. with the Dramatics Class as a
nucleus. it will also bring here
three or four outside lecturers on
topics of interest to the members,
and will present members of our
own facility in readings and lec—
tures. A four or ﬁve days' visit to
New York is planned when the
students may visit the Metropoli-
tan Musenm of Art, and see several
of the best plays under the guid-
ance of the instructors.

On Tuesdav, May sixth, the As-
sociation will present Miss Fut-

terer in George Bernard Shaw‘s
"Pygmalion," a modern play built
around the idea in the anctent
Greek legend of that name. It re-
ouires clever, strenuous acting. and
Miss [Tatterer reads it with a charm
that we who know ‘her recognize
as hers alone.

The play to be presented by the
class this semester is "The Yellow
Jacket.” a Chinese play which holds
one ofthe highest places in the
opinion of critics. it is an ambi-
tious production, and the class s
confident of making it a success.

After dinner comes “rest hour"
