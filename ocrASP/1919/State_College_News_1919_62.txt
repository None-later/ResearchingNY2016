STATE COLLEGE NEWS, MAY 17, 1919

COLLEGE PUBLICATIONS

The students of the college sup-
port four publications. Perhaps of
chief importance ainonr these is
the “State College News,“ a copy of
which is here represented. The
paper is published weekly through-
out all the college year. it aims to
represent all 0 the interests and
activities of colic e life, It is dis-
tinctly a “ news’ publication.

The "Pedagognc " is the annual
yearbook, published by the Senior
class. It contains a record of the
class history, the student activities
of the college as a whole, and for
the current year, and humorous or
satirical impressions of college life.

The College Songbook is a col-
lection of songs of our own Alma
Mater, of those of other colleges,
and of familiar songs. The price is
$1.00. Books may be ordered of
Miss Lois 13. Knox, chairman of
the Songbook Committee, at the
college. If book is to be mailed
add 25 cents for postage.

new publication which ap
peared this year is the “State Coi-
lcge Quarteer." This magazine is
purely literary and artistic, cori-
taining the original work of the
students and faculty. The “Quar-
terly” is a rc-birth of the “ Echo,"
a former monthly publication, and
is a decided improvement over the
"Echo," as Well as a creditable
publication at the college.

The Alumni Association is now
working on the ﬁrst issue of an
alumni publication, to be known as
the "Alumni Quarterly,” The ﬁrst
issue is expected to be ready for
distribution by July ist.

HISTORY OF “ STATE
COLLEGE NEWS ”

The " State College News " occu-
pies a position of peculiar import-
ance at State College, since no
other publication performs the
same function of recording college
happenings and expressing college
opinion.

The history of the "News"
harks back to Moving-up Day, 1916,
when the class of 1918 presented
as its stunt an allegory, the object
of which was to Show the advan—
tages of the introduction into col—
lege life of a weekly newspaper.
This idea happily concurred with
a plan of President Brubacher‘s.
and as a result the president of
1918, Alfred E. Dcdicke, was an-
thorized to publish a college week—
ly. A committee was appointed
with Alfred Dedickc as Chairman.
The ﬁrst issue of the " News " was
published October 4, 1916, headed
by the following letter:

” This great State College of ours
was once a small college. With a
steadily increasing number of stu—
dents, courses and activities were
gradually extended, until to—day
the boundaries of student-life in-
close stretches reaching from the
Chemistry Club to the Promethean
Literary Society, from the Athletic
ﬁeld to the Auditorium, from the
Library to the Gymnasium, from
the Senior to the Freshman, and
so on, from one extreme to the
other, touching upon scores of in-
dependent groups, each with a dif—
fercnt interest and none visibly
connected with another. The close
observer must discover now the
presence of that same threatening
danger in our student-life, which
history shows to have once existed
in the United States—a decided
trend toward sectionalism and
away from centralization. We have

 

 

by no means reached a crisis, but
there is a great need for seine
means by which there can be
brought to bear upon our student
body a similar influence to that
which is being exerted u on the
nation by the railroads, tie tele-
graph, and the telephone. There
has arisen in need for a means of
bringing cac‘h extreme of our stu—
dent life into direct touch With the
other, of makin this heterogeneity
into which we .iavc grown a solid
unit, a single collegiate family.
What better means than a‘news-
paper, such as the ‘Statc College
News,’ to achieve the desired rc-
suits?

" In it will’ be pictured with in-
sistent regularity and in install-
ments quickly following one
another, the history of each unit
of our college life. In its columns
you will feel the pulse beat of «the
student body. .lt will be as a mir-
ror standing at an angle into
which a body peering will not see
his own, but rather the image of
another.

“Thus do we launch this journal
on its course, with every conﬁdence
that it ﬁlls a long felt want, and
that its policy: to make each fac-
tion of our student organization
know and appreciate all others, to
uphold the ‘lllilllllCliflllCC of frater-
nal regard and friendly rivalry
among all, to work for co-opcraiion
between all sections and for the
solidliciition of the now separately
wasted energies in the promotion
of a real, distinct, and enthusiastic
spirit of loyalty to State College,
will in time do much toward plac-
ing the record of our achievements
outside of the classroom on it plane
in keeping with our standing as
America’s leading teachers’ college.

“ (Signed) The Committee of the

Class of 1918, on Publishing a
Weekly College Newspaper.
“ ALFRED DEDiCKI“.,
Chairman."

Thus began this student enter-
prise which has developed in the
course of three years into a dyna-
mic iorcc behind college spirit and
unity.

Thcsc beginnings were a mere
dream of the class of '18, in the
spring of 1916. \Vith the rc»opcn-
ing of college, Alfred Dedicke had
initiated the dream into realization,
and with a committee appointed by
Fresidcnt Brubachcr, the “ News "
began to appear weekly. The fol-
lowing peoplc were members of
that ﬁrst committee on publishing
a weekly newspaper:

Alfred Dcdickc, chairman; Doro-
thy Anstin, Stanley Henson, Eloise
Lansing, Lillian Magilton, Joseph
VVailrer, Henry Greenbiatt, Kath—
ryn Cole, Mildred MacEwan, Ben—
jamin Cohen, Ray Townsend.
Maud Rose, Elmctta Van Dcloo.
This committee was later divided
into sub-committees according to
the principle of “ differentiation of
labor." Alfred Dcdicke became
cdilor—in-ciiief and Lillian Magii-
ton business manager. With two
such capable students at the helm.
the paper was well managed and
edited.

With autumn, 1917, came a great~
or change. The ﬁnancial worries
of the "News" vanished with the
appearencc of the Student Tax.
When war was declared a year ago
the rush of State College men to
the colors included many of those
connected with the “ News." Since
this was a new venture, and not
ﬁrmly established, Myskania ap-
pointed a board composed of per~

THE CONSTITUTION FOR
THE “ STATE COLLEGE
QUARTERLY ”

The necessity for a new consti—
tution for the literary publication
of State College was clearly seen
last spriu '. A new constitution has
been drafted which bases election
to the board entirely on competi-
tiou. In this way publication
boards of other colleges are select—
oil, and to make election to the
board an honor to be worked for
has proved a distinct advantage.
The constitution follows: ‘

“l. "The State College Quarterly’
is a literary magazine, published
four times a year and devoted to
the publication of the best poetry,
and prose written by the faculty,
alumni, and student both.

“2. The Publication Board shall
consist of an Ed‘itordn-Chief, ﬁve
Assistant Editors. a Business Man-
ager, and two Advertising Mana-
gers.

.1. Tile duties of the Assistant
Editors are to be outlined by the
Etlitor-in-Chief.

b. The E'ditordn-Chief and Busi-
ness h‘lanagcr shall be members of
the Senior Class.

c. Election to the board, except
in the case of candidates for Busi-
ness Managership shall be deter«
mined by the number and quality
of the published contributions of
each candidate and service ren-
tiered.

"3. The liilitor-invChicf shall
prepare a record of contributions
and report this to the board at their
annual election in the spring of
each year, with liliS nominations of
new members based upon this rec-
ord. From this list of nominations
the editors shall make their clcc—
tions.

"4. Election to the Business
Managership shall be determined
by the Board of Editors, but the
Business Manager shall nominate
for the position the students who
have offered themselves as candi—
dates for the position and have
assisted the Business Manager
most efﬁciently in conducting the
ﬁnances of the paper. When no
such candidate has presented him-
self, election shall be made from
the existing board of editors.

“ The Erlitor-in-Ohief shall
have general supervision over the
publication of the paper; shall, with
the assistance of those Assistant
Editors whom he may select, read
and pass upon the manuscripts
submitted; shall appoint the As—
sistant Editors to their :depart-
ments, and shall be responsible for
the printing and proof—reading.

“6. The Business Manager shall
conduct the ﬁnances of the paper.
shall receive all moneys, and make
an annual report of his accounts,
properly drawn and audited by the
treasury of the student fund, and
be printed in the "News."

SOCIAL ACTIVITIES

Without a doubt, almost every—
one is interested in “good times,”
and State College has quite a few

notony of daily routine. The
i’i'cs‘hnien are especially fortunate,
because the faculty and upper-
classmen are so anxious to make
the newcomers feel at home that
receptions are given to accomplish
this purpose.

The ﬁrst reception is given by
the faculty, This may sound as
though it is a stiff, formal affair,
but such is not the case. Every—
