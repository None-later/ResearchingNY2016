COllege Work

With Americanizatiou- fast as-
suming a place on tile peace time
program of even greater impor-
tance than it occupied among ac-
tivities of the war period, the serv-
ice given by.Siate College in this
preemineutly interesting field be-
comes of special interest. It is
not the purpose of this article to
give a history of the Americaniza-
tion movement but merely to set
down such phases of it as are in—
cluded in the teacher training
course in immi rant education
offered at the colege and which
have been marked by closest co-
operation with the State Education
department and With the Albany
agencies interested in the subject.

While not generally known it is
a fact that the first professional
course offered for the training of
teachers in immigrant education
was given at State College and
about forty students enrolled. This
was in the autumn of 1915. Amer-
icanization was a comparatively
new subject at the time but the
fundamental ideas of the move-
ment were given by William C.
Smith, supervisor of immigrant
Education, tatc Education De~
partment. through whose efforts
the initial course proved a success.
and by Prof. H. H. Goldberger of
New York city, and Robert ’
Hill, professor of economics,
Union College, both of whom have
spoken before Americanization
students since that time.

chief (liﬁieultics to the progress of

ent colleges and universities in the
State are doing much to obviate
that trouble. in this work State
College has made a most valuable
contribution and the Americaniza—
tion work here has gained a name
for itself throughout the country.
One of the features of the course
has been the work of students who
have volunteered to teach home
and neighborhood classes in Al-
bany under the direction of Miss
Clara B. Springsteed. assistant su-
pervisor of immigrant education,
and more than a score of home
classes are being taught as a result.

Because of the success attained
by these home classes. taught by
student volunteers, Secretary of
the Interior Franklin l\’. Lane re-
cently sent a representative to A1-
banyito study this phase of the
work, it is said that her report
will speak highly of the situation
in Albany which is considered one
of.the best in the state from the
paint of view of Americanization

work. The Council of Jewish‘

aided the Federal and State pro-
grams in the Capital City, and the
Americanizatlon courses at State
College have provided a most
practical means, of co-opcration by
which field work is provided for
students.

While night schools and factory
classes have heretofore been tl‘c
chief means of reaching the adult
foreign born. the work of home
visiting in Albany has proved it~
self to he one of the most effective.
if not the most effective, Amcri~
cauizing iullucnccs as it reaches
the mother as well as other adult
members who are unable to attend
factory classes or night schools by
reason of home duties or long
working hours. The home visiting
plan has found a welcome in every
foreign home where il has been
tried and the achievements of State
College students in this connection
are very likely to have a marked
influence in the shaping of A1ncri~
cauization programs in the future.

hat these students have
learned as to the usefulness of
home visiting is contained in a
memorandum of ten points, copies
of which have been forwarded to
the Americanization Division at
Washington as follows:
Reasons for Conducting Home and

Neighborhood Classes.

1. They make it possible for
those who are unable to go to
night school to study English and
become better acquainted with
American laws, customs, and
standards of living.

‘here are four classes of people
who are unable to go to night
sc too : ’

a. Men who work during the
nigit.

h. Men who work too late in the
evening to reach night school on
time.

c. Women who cannot leave
their homes because of small chil-
dren and household duties.

(1. Girls who work in stores and
factories. whose parcnts will not
permit them to go out to night
school alone.

2. The home and neighborhood
class overcomes the natural shy~
ness, timidity, and fear of the for-
eign born by giving them instruc-
tion in their own environment.

3. They open up a direct and
friendly approach to:

a. Better hygienic and sanitary
conditions.

). Cleaner and better prepared
for) .

c. A morc balanced diet.

d. Greater attention to proper
care of babies and children.

4. The home and ncighhonhood
class means a one-language home
with fewer misumlerstandiugs and
better discipline.

5. The home class gives better
opportunity for consideration of
the individual and for response to
this peculiar needs.

6. The home class gives the
teacher the opportunity to find out
more quickly and more easily than
she could in the classroom about
tibc previous life in the Oh] coun-
try. T‘his knowledge is essential
to the satisfactory progress of the
class.

7. Through the home class the
teacher may become the connect-
ing link between the foreign man
or woman and the proper outside
agencies which they need to help
them. Thus she can help the for-
eigner to come out of his all-tom
foreign environment and ioin
hands with the native American
for the common welfare.

8. The home class gives the for-

College.
cign man and woman the opportu-
nity to show their hospitality to
the native American. This reacts
in turn to strengthen llhe sympa—
thy bctwccu the two.

9, By giving the foreign mother
in the home the opportunity to
learn to speak. read and write the
language of this country and of
her children, the future citizens of
this country, we. are helping to
make a nation of sturdy, loyal
Americans.

10.Thc eagerness and enthu<
siasm of those attending . the
classes prove that the undertaking
is meeting a dclinile need, and that
it is meeting it with the whole-
heartcd response of the foreign—
born. leC request for a lessnn
every day instead of only twice a
week is often heard and speaks
volumes for the responsiveness of
members of these neighborhood
groups.

These ten points epitomize but
one phase of the Americanization
program which is probably one of
the most vital. signilicaut educa<
tional movements in the country
to-(lay. There are other sides to
the problem, notably the stimu<
lation of the native-born Ameri-

 

    
 

cans to a fuller re' ation of the
worth and useful] of their fel-
low citizens of foreign birth or for-
eign extraction. in striking at
adult illiteracy the movement aims
at breaking down what is probably
the grcales obstacle to assimila-
tion that cxtsts among our foreign-
horn ln-(lay. When the illiteracy
figures of New York State alone
are cm idL-rcd the proposition] that
Aincricanlzalion workers face is
truly formidable. The federal ccn<
sus of 1910 listed 597,012 non-
linglish speaking over ten years of
age and the same census gave the
number of illiteratcs as 406,020 of
whom 362,025 were of foreign
birth.

Legislation now pending in New
York State provides for ‘l system
of zones with
teachers in each speci ng on
eliminating adult illiteracy. The
bill provides $100,000 for the work,
money which could hardly be bet-
ter spent, and it is worthy of at-
tention that missionary work done
by State College students in co—
operation with Albnny agencies
was probably the cdiicf contribut-
ing ct ise for favorable action by
the legislature.
