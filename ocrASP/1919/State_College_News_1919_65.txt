SOCIAL ACTIVITIES

Continued from Page 10

this occasion—platnting novel ways
and means to get the students ac-
quainted \Vlltll t-he >llthC0ll1C". The
Seniors and Juniors do not wish to
be left out of all tlte fun, so etch
of these classes gives a reception.
These receptions are very informal
and consequently, very enjoyable.

lint festivities do not end with
the above mentioned events. There
are others all through [the year.
For instance, each class has a
party just for itself. These are
generally informal dances. Then
besides these parties, each class
except the Freshmen, is given a
Weekend. The first is the Junior
Week-end which follows the mid-
year examinations. 'l‘be events
that take place are a reception, the
prom, a banquet and a basketball
game, ‘

Sophomore \Vcek—cnd comes in
March. The festivities include a
reception, a suiree and a basket-
ball game.

Senior Week comes in June. it
is then that Class Day, Alumni
Day, Baccalaureate Address, Com-
mencement and the Senior Ball
take place.

Those are the big events of the
year, and there are also many tili—
nor ones. Foremost, perhaps, of
these are the G-irls’ Atlbletic Asso-
ciation parties. No need to cont-
ment upon these, for the mere
mentioning of "gym ft‘olics"
brings pleasant memories to all
State College girls, Then, on Sat-
urday afternoons frotn 3 to 5
o’clock there is dancing class coit-
ducted by some of the College
girls. Talking about dancing is a
reminder in regard to basketball
games. Dancing always follows
after the Varsity games in the Al-
bany High School gymnasium.

The sororities attd fraternities
also have their festivities. These
iltclude an intersorority tea soon
after College begins, rush-parties,
annual banquets. and a formal it'l-
tersorority ball.

One of the new social events he-
guu this year by Dr. Brubacher
was the Men‘s Annual Basketball
banquet. Another event for the
men is the smoker given by the
faculty men. This is a very enjoy-
able “get-together” ai’fair to pro-
mote fellowship among the faculty
and students.

‘his basrbeen just a brief restuné
of State College activities which
help to develop the social side of
College life

inasmuch as the majority of
tthese social times are over at ll
o’clock the students’ work can in
no way suffer.
