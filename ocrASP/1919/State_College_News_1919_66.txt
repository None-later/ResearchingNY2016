INDUSTRIAL EDUCA TION

The importance of Industrial
Education is being recognized
tnore each year by both State and
Federal governments, The Smith—
llugbes Law is a symbol of the
l’ederal (.ioverninent’s recognition
of the value of industrial education.
By providing federal aitl the law
will prove a great stimulus to
tiianual training and increase the
demand for teachers along indus-
trial lines.

To become an efficient teacher
requires not only trade and indus-
trial knowledge, but also a good
general education. Such a prepara—
tion of industrial teachers is given
at State College.

The trade knowledge or indus-
trial training given in our own in~
stitn-tion is as good as may be ob~
tained in any college in the coun-
try. ln the summer of 1918 over
live hundred men were trained iii
all lines of mechanical work at the
industrial department of State Col-
cge. The training received here
was recognized by the War De-
partment as beingr equal to that re-
ceived in any college, such as Cor—
nell, l’rat-t, Clarkson, etc. This
proves that our equipment and our
instructors are of the very best.

Our equipment is modern and
up to date. We have a fine work-
shop with all modern machines.
Our machine shop is equipped with
such machinery that the student
will receive training in nearly all
the principles of machine shop
practice. Besides We have the
forging, plumbing and drafting
rooms. The shops are kept fully
equipped and up to date by adding
new machines each year.

Two excellent courses are of-
fered in industrial training, the two
year course and the four year
course. A candidate for the two
year course must have had three
years of hiin school work or its
equivalent. in the two years he
Wlll receive instruction in all lines
of work necessary to prepare him
to’ teach in any industrial school.
ll-lis training includes wood-work
mg. machine shop practice,
plumbing, mechanical drawing,
forging, moulding, pattern-mak—
ing, history and principles of
education, as well as a course
in methods and practice teach—
ing of inductrial subjects. He
will also be trained in mathematics
and mechanics necessary for the
teacher in industrial schools. Up-
on thc successful completion of this
course the student will receive a

 

 

 

DEPA R TMEN T

life certificate to teach industrial
subjects.

The four year course includes all
of the above subjects with the ad-
dition of a minor in some other
subject. A minor of physics, client-
istry, mathematics or physical edit-
cation is the best for an industrial
student. llesides a minor in a dif-
ferent subject, the student registers
for enough subjects to give him the

. S. degree upon the successful
completion of the four year cotirsc.
He also receives his life certificate
to teach industrial subjects and
such other subjects as he may be
qualified to teach.

The salary ior men being gradu—
ated front either one of these
courses is from $l2tll) to $1500 to
start. The increase after his first
year‘s teaching will depend upon
the titan. The salary for a two»
year man may be the same as a
four-year student, but the four~
your man receives his ll. S. and has
a much better chance for advance-
ment, because of training received
in more subjects and a better gene-
ral education. However, if a slit-
dent finds he has insufficient counts
to enter for a four—year course, he
may at the end of a two~year course
transfer his work to a four-year
course, and by taking a few addi—
tional subjects necessary, he may
receive his 13.  degree.

The profession of teacher of iii-
(ltistrics requires the possession of
a mechanical turn of mind in ad—
dition lo the teaching ability. With
these a young man can hope to
prepare our future men to be more
efficient citizens.

classes then form an aisle down the
chapel steps and down the walk,
through which the other classes

pass, in turn.

Each class stages a
the campus.

The entire afternoon is given
over to athletic meets of various
Sorts.

Last year a new movement was
started, in the nature of a Campus
Sing. This took place in the even-
ing, and was successful to the nth
degree. There were community
singing and “step singing" by the
various classes. Then followed a
couple of ‘hours of dancing on the
campus, This feature of the day
will be remembered almost more
than any other—and it is a feature
that has come to stay.

The Home Economics Depart~
ment was established in Septem»
ber, 1910. The first cotirse was but
one year in length. Since that time,
the course has expanded and itn~
proved to cover four years, culmin-
ating in a llacllelor of Science de-
gree. ' ‘
Courses are given in clothing, in-
cluding plain sewing, dressmaking,
millinery, textiles and handiwork.
All of these courses are correlated
with the art department, in which
courses of elementary design, cos-
tume design and household decor-
ation are given.

The courses in foods include
preparation and service of meals
for family and larger groups, with
practical work in the college cafe-
teria. Work is also given in his-
tory of foods, demonstration and
experimental cookery and nutri-
tion. This work correlates strong—
ly with the science departments.

A recent addition to the equip-
ment of the department is the cafe-
ter'i, which has a two-fold pur-
pose. to provide a practical outlet
for cookery class products and
practice in management of a school
lunch-room and to provide good
and reasonable food to college stu-
dents. [I] this way the student diet
is tipci‘viscd and affords practice
or L s in nutrition. The equip-
ment, which is practical and elli—
cietit, is being constantly improved
to better serve the needs.

The (lrc smakiiig shop is another
new project, and is the laboratory
for the use of the sewing and dress-
milking classes. it also is equipped
well with foo and powcrmacliiiies,
work and cutting tables. Class iii-
struetion is given, as usual, in the
class-room in the college, but held
work, amounting to from three to
six hours a week, is conducted in
the shop under the supervision of
a practical dr ‘ 1'. All types
of work are done for children and
adults. from alteration and re-
modeling, to the construction of
new garments.

The Practice House is now three
years old, Ilere small groups of
seniors live fora month, two weeks
the first tester and two weeks
the second incstcr. While they
are living here they organize and
conduct all the household activities,
each serving in ttirii as hostess,
cook, waitress and chamber-maid.
This work is all under supervision
and is a culmination of the very
work which they have been doing
in classes during the previous three
years.

About a liftcciivmilllltc walk,
across the park from the college is
the dormitory, "Sydilnni Hall,"
housing twenty-two girls. This
home is under the direct super-
vision of the department, one of
its faculty living with the girls, as
house-inot'her, This is the first real
dormitory which has been set up
in connection with the college, and
it has proved a decided success.
The lll use is large, airy, and coin-
fortifblc, with a living—room which
affords an opportunity for social
gatherings of various kinds. The
girls’ rooms are pleasant atid neat-
ly furnished. At the back of the
house is a yard of considerable
size, which is enjoyed during the
spring and summer days.

As a source of remuneration, the
department offers three fields of
work. Any student who applies
may sccnre work in the dressmak—
ing shop, in the :afcteria, or the
dormitory, alid will he paid by the
hour, Because all of these pro-
jects are run under the direct super-
vision of the department, it is felt

 

 

 
 

 

 

 

 

DEPAR TMEN T

that the students who seek work,
can find no more dc. rablc condi-
tions.

Although the purpose of the
Home lironoiiiics Department is
to train teachers. the graduates will
be found in SCVcl'lll other fields of
eeinployineiit. Many students have
found large opportunities in hospi~
lalS, not only in New York State,
hilt M' ' 'hiisetfs and New Jersey,
as dietitians. They are doing
splendid work, and receiving exch-
leiit remuneration. Other gradu-
ates are directors and workers in
cafeterias and lunch—rooms in vari-
ous places throughout the State.
This, also, has been found an ex»
celleiit m‘ans for using education
received in college. Scientific 1a-
boratory work has called a fewer
number. These girls have been
found especially valuable and bin
portaiit during the war and recent
epidemics.

This illustrates the scope of the
work presented by the department.

FINE ARTS

During the past year lllt‘ Art
Department has succeeded in pro-
diicing some very fine Work.

Tivo very interesting courses
given are: The History of Ancient
and Medieval Art and Art Appre-
ciation. lioth of these are open to
the students generally and form a
good cultural background for : iy
work they happen to be spccialiv-
ing in, Much of the course is done
in connection with the i-xhihi .
the Historical and Art Building as
well as the two cathedrals and
other objects of local intercs l‘liich
year the students look forward
eagerly to the trip to New York,
where a study is made of the Met»
ropolitan Museum of .\rt and any
other places of artistic interest.

The class in methods is one of
the most practical in college, for
it is run parallel to the teaching in
the Junior High school, and thus
teaches not only theory but actual
experience. incidentally, the indus-
trial side of school art work is
brought out, and litany problems
such as work in enamels, linoleum
blocking, rnginaking, etc,, are pro-
duced.

The three remaining classes are
technical in nature, where the stu-
dent has a chance to perfect him-
self in d . and representation,
and learn the use of various nic-
diuins such as pencil sketching, pen
and ink, charcoal, watcr~coloriug.
These classes have been of the
greatest l)Lll(‘fll to the college, for
dozens of posters of various kinds
have been made for innumerable
happenings in the college; even
(lance orders to the extent of .‘lflfl
or more were made by the linoleum
block process. Most of the cuts
for the “Pedagogue” were also
made in one of these classes, as
well as the Scenery for the plays
given by the Dramatics Class dur—
in},r the year.

We, as students in the depart-
ment, feel that from the classes—
espccially Art Appreciation—we
gained a wonderful new point of
view, one which enables us to take
a more intelligent enjoyment in
not only the art of bygone ages,
but in objects of local interest. its
influence has beep felt about col-
lege in many ways, the better
grade of printing which has ap-
peared of late y ‘ars. for instance.
in conclusion, we consider the Art
Department one of vital import-
ancc, not only to those within it,
but to the whole college.
