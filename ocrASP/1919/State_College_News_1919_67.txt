h. The Jlead of the Department
of Business Administration will act

in April, Myskania made further
additions, granting the petition of
the “ News " board for several
changes in its constitution:

Article one, section A, is amend
ed to inchtdc in the list of
board members a subscription mau—
agcr, who shall he a senior, and
the mailing list each week, to cor-
rect aitunni lists to date, and to
direct the competition for subscrip
tiou manager.

Article one ection 1.), paragraph
Lhree now reads " March ” instead
of “February” for announcing the
uudcrclassmen additions to the
boart.

 

The number of juniors on the
board is increased front live to six.

The appropriation of $11K) al-
lowed to the .f’rcss Club for assist-
ing the publication of the annual
big issue of the "News" is not
claimed this year, since the club
has not organized. ln order to
publish this issue, it is necessary
for the “News” ltoarti to have
this money. Therefore, Myskania
has voted to allow the board to use
this money for this pttrpose.

In order to have all social events
properly reported in the “News,”
Myskania has ruled that the board
of Editors shall have the right to
send a representative from any
class to any function, said person
to be admitted by regulation ticket
issued from Miss l'ierce’s olliee.

THE JUNIOR BIG SISTERS

The entering class ‘ach year' is
fortunate in the greeting tendered
them by the Juniors. in the smu-
.mer preceding the comingr of the
Freshmen, ‘ach Junior writes to
a prospective student, and offers
assistance in any way possible—
such as securing a boarding place,
meeting the train, etc. Later the
Juniors acquaint the Freshmen
with the points of interest about
the College and the city, and act
as general guardians until the
Freshmen become acclimated.
