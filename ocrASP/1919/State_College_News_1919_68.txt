ALBANY ITSELF
Continued from l‘nge 3

Then there is the State Capitol,
around which is associated the nat-
ural interest connected with such
a building. Here one has an op-
portunity of seeing ihc practical
workings of the State in all its com—
plexities. Here are civics and gov~
ernment, not an abstract theory
but an actuality. Sessions of the
Legislature are open to the stu~
dents and many oi the discussions
carried on are of great value.

Reminders of Revolutionary
days ‘may be seen at the Historical
Arts Society Building. Likewise
here may be found relies from a
much earlier period, brought from
lands much older than America.
To those who like to, browse
among the reminders of the early

settlement of Albany, the.Schuy-’

ler Mansion would be of, interest.
This building has been preserved
intact since Philip Schuyler and
Alexander Hamilton freqtiented it.

And now to touch upon the
amusements and recreation which
Albany offers. .l'lariuanus Blecckcr
Hall presents standard plays, coin-
edies and concerts Especial at-
tention is called to the Franklin
concerts in which such artists as
Martinelli, Galli Curci, McCor-
inack and others are presented.
There are several good places for
“movies” iiicltidiiig l’roetor’s with
its vaudeville, the Colonial, lind—
5on, I-‘ine Hills, Clinton Square
and the Leland. Construction of
21 Strand is under way on North
Pearl street. This is to be the
largest theatre of its kind in the
country. its seating capacity is
to be greater than that of the New
York Strand.

Albany oFfers many opportuni-
ties from the commercial stand-
point. lts large department stores
are excellent for shopping. its
factories give opportunities for
studying the labor question besides
observing the technical processes.
To the industrial and Home Eco-
nomics students it offers a Iicld for
practical work. To the book lover
Albany presents greater possibili-
ties, for here are book stores cs—
tablishctl in the 18th and 19111 cen-
turies, which are known even in
Europe as stores of repute. Like-
wise there are stores selling and
displaying antiques, and there are
gift shops and tea rooms. In fact.
Albany can offer advantages com~
mon to any large city, but espe—
cially attractive here in this very
old capital city.

A FREE TEACHERS’
GENCY

 

It is well understood that the
United States Employment Service
.has been very severely cut, on ac-
count of the adjournment of Con.
gress without passing the neces«
sary appropriation bills. Certain
branches of the Service, however,
are still working under full pres-
stire.

Notable among these parts of
the Federal organization which
have shown vitality strong enough
to persist in living, is the section
for the placement of teachers,
which had been organized under
the guidance of the Federal Di-
rector of the U. S. Employment
Service for M liusctts.

When the national crash came.
which closed all but lifty-six of the
seven hundred and fifty ollices in
the United States, the Chief of the
’i'eachers' Section at the Boston
office offered to continue the work
without salary, provided oilice
space could be furnished. At this
point Huston University came to
the rescue to ihe extent of giving
quarters for this I’rce 'I‘cachers'
Agency in the lltlilrllllg of the
(.‘Ulgidifilﬁ ()I" ilUnlNIiSS Al)~
h'llNlS'I‘RA'l‘IUN. 525 loylston
Street. Moreover. the privilege of

” dollar—a~year man "

 

workingr as a
was accorded in the Chief (II the
Section.

This lioston office is now the
ZONE ()I'I‘ILIIF. for all the lerri~
tory lying cast of Chicago, and
those in charge here wish all tcaeh~
crs and school ol'liei: ls—cspccially
those in New [England—to know
that the office is still open and its
services free.

 

TRAINING OF TEACHERS

T-he fundamental purpose of the
New York Stale College for Teach-
ers is to give the basis of scholar~
ship and special method now
deemed necessary for secondary
school teachers. Courses are ar-
ranged in such a way that all stu~
dents must lay a broad foundation
of informative and cultural studies
before they devote themselves to
specialization, The scheme of
major and minor studies allows
thorough preparation in one sub~
jeitt or in several closely related
subjects. The courses in the
Theory and Practice of Teaching
cover all hiin school studies and
are followed by practice teaching
in the Milne High School. Each
senior student teaches his major
subject during a period of twenty
weeks. This practice teaching is
preceded by observation of model
lchons given by the supervisors of
practice teaching. The student sees
the sucessful application of correct
methods of teaching and has a
share in working out educational

experiments under actual high
school conditions.
DEGREES

The College offers to those slu-
dcnts who meet the conditions of
admisston, four-year courses lead-

ing to the degree of Bachelor of,

Arts and liachclor of Science cov~
cring the studies ordinarily pur-

gether with certain requirements in

of successful practice teaching till-
der supervision. It also provides
four-year courses preparing stu-
dents to teach special subjects in
