Moving-Up Day _

 

'l'bt- iirst event srhcduled on the
Moving-up [lay pr .gram was the
Frosb-Soph banner h. For the
second time the Sophomore men
have defeated their opponents in the
Moving-up Day tlag rush. :\ year
ago the class of '21 flew their flag
above that of 1920. This year it
was the elas of '23 that felt the
lnuuiliatiou of defeat, for shortly
after the start linker. '21, gained the
chimney top and unfurled the Soph
banner. llaker was loudly cheered
by the hundreds of students who
watched the rush. The remainder
of the time was spent by the Frosh
in trying to get on the boiler house
roof, but the Sophs were able to keep
them oil.

This scrap was not such an excit-
ing affair as the one held last year,
but this was due to a misuudcr»
standing.r by the Freshmen upon the
place chosen by the powers-that-be
as the highest point. Nevertheless,
the lirosh put up a good, clean tight,
and may possibly hare won had it
not been for this misunderstanding.

l"'ich Moving-up Day at State is

SHAKESPEARE CLASS

INTERESTING PROGRAM
Acted Scenes from “ Twelfth
- Night"

The Shakespeare class presented
three scenes from “Twelfth Night,"
a comedy, last Monday afternoon,

. in the college auditorium. To say

that the scenes were well done is
putting it mildly. The different
casts in each seeue deserve credit
for their splendid work. The first
scene given was the one showing
the meeting between Olivia” and
Viola. Marian Runny made a
charming Olivia, who was bored to
death with the attentions of Duke
Orsino. Elizabeth Archibold was
delightful as the boyish Viola, who'
carried love messages from the
duke to the lady of his heart. The
other members of this cast were'-
Maria, rcry saucily acted by Eunice
Myers; the austere Malvolio,
Lillian Johnson, and the ladies-ire
waiting, Madeline (iouardf Eileen
Russell and l’-arl Stark.

The second scene had only two
actors, Duke Orsino and Viola.
Dorothy Maybew was very enter-
tainiui,r as the love-sick duke. Jean
Antes Connors took the part of
Viola. and although her interpreta-
tion of this character (littered from
Miss .~\rchibuld’s, it was equally as
pleasing.

The third scene was the one in
which Maria, this time played by
Lorna Collins, “plants” the letter
for Malvolio. Dorothy Wight as
Malvolio was a scream. ller inter-
pretation of this part was exceed-
ingly comimudable, for it was a

- hard character to portray. Harriet

Doyle, as Sir Toby, did some clever
acting. Her make-up and “fat”
laugh provoked more than one real
laugh from the audience. The part
of the third couspirator in the joke,
Fabian, was taken by Betty Beck-
wrth, who was a distinct contrast
