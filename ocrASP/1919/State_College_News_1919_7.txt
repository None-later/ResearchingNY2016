' THE OTHER VIEW

\Vhilc we admit that wc were
fairly and squarely dcfcalcd last
Saturday, let us look at thc othcr
self-evident side.

State's mrn playcd a rousing
good game. livery prcss rt'ptll‘l
cmnplimcntcd Colgate on its vic
tory over the splendid dcfcusc of
Slalo Collcgr. (‘nlgutc's coach told
L'oach Maroucy that it was his
stiffrst game, and that our tram had
improved ﬁfty pcr ccnt. sinrc our
ﬁrst clash on thc Hamilton court.

And not a spcctat’nr thvrc but
was thrilled by the shots " Marty "
and “Fitz” madc. Only once did
Colgate go more than two in the

lead. State's tenacious guarding
hcld tho opponcnts' lcad until
"Fitz" or “Marty” could even

up the scorc. Just a few seconds
before the whistle sounded on the
last half the SCt'll‘C board recorded
a tie. Then one shot by Colgate,
thc swift passing,r of the ball to
the State College cml of the court,
and the whistlc.

Colgate wmt~truly a grcal vic~
tnry. But Stale did not sull'cr a
great loss. Slutr can play basket-

WE PROTEST

Wc, Us 8: (T ., everybody at
‘Statc College, wish to make a vig-
orous protest against another exam
week like the our just passed. it
is too late for this protest to effect
this semester’s results. but it is not
an ‘inopportunc time to protest
agamst a repetition of the 19l9 mid-
years.

One hour exams at regular class
time sound “snappy” and " cinchy,”
but they're not. A student must
be prepared on exactly as much
material as for a regulation three—
hour exam. with no between-time
periods to rust and study. Under
the old system twn exams might
come on one day, than one or
two days' respite before the next.
But this year from two to ﬁve dif-
ferent exams wcrc liable to come
in succession, with perhaps only
the lunch hour for intermission.

 

In this connection. we express our
appreciation to those faculty mem—
bers who kindly gave their tests
on the ﬁrst rccitation hour of the
