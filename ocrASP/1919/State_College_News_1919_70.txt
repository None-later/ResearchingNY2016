A WORD TO THE KNOCK-
ERS ,

With the issue of the “big
'News’" has come a considerable
amount of adverse criticism. We
are ver sorry to hear this. We
acknowledge various minor errors
which are necessarily inevitable in
an extra-sized number. Omission
of names or events, or mistakes in
numerals should never be attri-
buted to personal spite or careless-
ness. ,

For one thing we are very glad—
a good share of this criticism has
been made directly to the editors;
but when such remarks or sugges-
tions are felt to be necessary we
wish our critics to please have a
heart, now and then, and consider
the difficulties under which the
various numbers of the "News" are
issued. One thing more — our
“Smiles” column has been called
stale-and dry. When really funny
things happen in class, or any-
where, please jot them down and
we’ll be only too glad to publish
them.

STUDENT DISCUSSION

Did you ever hear any sleepy—
eyed college student emphatically
express his opinion of the inven-
tion-thatmakes him come to the
auditorium at 9 o’clock every Fri-
day morning? Or did you ever sit
in the auditorium on that morning
and Watch a gleeful look come into
the faces of the students as some
long-winded speaker talked far into
the time suppoSed to be spent re-
citing before some impatient prof?
Of course you have, but these are‘
only momentary displeasures and
joys caused by our Student Assem-

blies. Every State College student *

deep within himself is mightily
pleasedbecanse there are Friday
morn'inglassemblics. Just as we
would miss our class meetings or
our sorority and fraternity meet~
ings,_so we would miss our college
meetings. 1

But‘ although our assemblies
mean a great deal to us now, we
, can make more out of them if we

on the part of the student body to
speak on questions that are pre-
sented-to us to discuss and vote on.
There is often much heated (llScllS'
'sion in the halls and locker rooms

' before and after the astiembly, but

' cl a ee when such discus—
scuc y p p I We feel
free to talk in class meeting; why
not in Student Assembly? A little
honest discussion on matters
brought 'before us would put new
life into our Friday "gatherings."

To-morrow we shall have a
chance to talk on the question of a
Board of Finance. Let’s show that
'we have opinions to express and
the ability to get them over. '2l.

To the Editor:-

It may be out of place for a.

Senior to expreSs. an opinion upon
a matter of more direct concern to
undergraduates, but. being a nat-
ural "butter-iii,” I can't help writ-

ing‘ this.

iriday the students are to‘ vote
upon the matter of establishing a
ﬁnancial board to regulate and con-.
trol the student‘tax. Having seen
the working of the tax since its
inauguration, I can but say that the
idea is the best one advanced for
some time. Such a board has been
needed for some time.

Before voting. I hope all the stu-
dent body will read the articles of
the proposed constitution, posted
on the main bulletin board. In my
opinion there are many excellent
features proposed. But there is one
that has objectionable qualities

The membership of the board is
limited to seven. Apparently only
three of these seven are to be stu-
dents. Three are to be faculty
members elected by the students,
and the seventh is to be a treasurer,
appointed by the President of the
College. Of course, and properly.
this treasurer will be a faculty
member. That leaves the “balance
of power" with faculty members.
This hardly seems right. If stu-
dent money is to be spent, students
should Spend it. For instance, in
case of an appropriation request
similar to the one for charity which
came this year. should come,
students, NOT faculty, should de-
cide the matter.

Since by the constitution pro-
posed four out of ﬁve members
present at any meeting shall decide
a matter, it can be seen that the
four faculty members will control
the student money.

It is proper and necessary that
the faculty he represented. But is
it right that students shall be out-
ntimbered on the board of con—
trol?

I hope. Mr. Editor, that the stu-
dents will reflect upon this before
voting. The constitution can be
changed if the students wish it
changed. The students should be
satisﬁed when they vote.

A SENIOR.

 

To the Editor of the “ News “:

Regarding the proposed, consti—
tution for a Student Financial
Board, upon which I understand
we are to vote tomorrow, I won~
der how many of the students rcal~
ize the following facts:

1. The tax is paid by the students.

In the last three years only part of-

the faculty have paid. Even if all
the faculty were to pay the tax in
coming years, their money would

,make only a very, very small per

cent. of. the whole.

2. .This proposed board for con-
trolling student money has three
student members, not one of whom
may 'be a. voting member of a board
using money from the tax. Is this
fair, and is it necessary? The

members of our boards work very
hard and spend a very great deal
of time for the sake of the College.
And \vhat'do they get out of it?
A littlehonor and a great deal of
criticism. They know as much and
more about College needs than
most of us. Surely we .can trust
tllem‘to be fair-iiiinded members of
a financial board. . g
. There are four faculty mem-
bers on this board for controlling
student money. Five members out
of severiinust be present to consti-
tute a quorum and the vote of only
four is necessary to pass a measure.
Perhaps the faculty think that
the students do , not yet know
enough to control the expenditure
of their own money. That may iri-
deed be true, but in that case it
surely is time we learned a thing
or two before going out into the
"wide. wide worlt " and having
enormous salaries thrust upon us.
What do you think, you people
whose money is under discussion?
Wouldn't you rather have a board
having about six student members
and one faculty member, who
Would be treasurer? Certainly that
faculty member's advice would! be
a ‘most powerful factor if he were
as generally respected as most of
our faculty are. Just as a sugges-
tion, why not the treasurers of the
three upper classes, the business
managers of the “News” and
“Quarterly,” and a member of
Myskaiiia? A Senior.

HAVE YOU A ,
PEDAGOGUE?

 

The 1919 “Pedagogue” coincs out
the last week of this month. It is
to be two hundred and thirty pages
long—and that’s an increase of
about twenty pach over last year's,
you know—and will fairly bristle
with surprises. A few extra copies
were ordered, and so. if you haven't
already signed up for one, see Ger-
trude Sclicrmcrhorn or any other
member of the “l’cdagogue” board.

on never really appreciate a
"Pedagogue" until you have one of
your own.
