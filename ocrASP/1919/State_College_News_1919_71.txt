vice tlag was carried by Bertha Tate
and Hazel ,Brimmer.

The program opened with the
Alma Mater, led in Elizabeth Archi-
bald, '20, the Colege song leader.
This was followed by speakers from
each class. Martha Stuart, ’19, be-
lieves that the class of 919 ap—
proaches as nearly as possible, the
ideal Senior. Van Allen Lobdell,
’20, was certain that ’20 had reached
the idealistic stage. Nellie Park-
hurst, ’21, recalled incidents of class
spirit which proved that the Sopho-
mores were striving toward- an
ideal,‘and Clara Knickerbocker, ’22,
spoke of the dutiful ohedience of' ’22
to ’21 and- begged forgiveness from
the faculty for the times when ’22
had failed to be ideal Freshmen.
Hazel Hengge, ‘19, then presented
the Senior gift to the College, ask-
ing that the three hundred dollars in
Liberty honds go toward the fund
for an athletic ﬁeld in memory of
Dean Blue. Dr. llruhacher accepted
the gift for the College and ex—
pressed his pleasure in the choice of
the name for the ﬁeld. Earle Suther—
land, Senior president, in his fare‘
well speech expressed the thoughts
of the Senior class most admirably,
The classes then “Moved-up” in
traditional manner, each class tale
ing its new place, singing “Where,
Oh Where, Are the Verdant Fresh-
men." The Myskania for 1919-
20 consists of Elizabeth Archi—
bald, Katherine ‘Dcitz, Ellen Dona-
hue, Kenneth Holhen, Van Allen
Lohdell, Vera Matlin, Marian
Moore, Marcella Ryan, Sarah Roody.
George Schiavnnc, Edward T.
Springman and Lovisa Veddcr, The
old and new Myskania led the stu-
dent body from tile auditorium to
the campus, where each class formed
its numerals.

The class stunts began with a re-
view of State College days by the
Seniors. The good old Normal
days were portrayed by Hazel Byers
and Dorothy Roberts in charming
old-fashioned costumes. The State
Normal College days came back in
all their glory with Mary Carney
and Thomas Castellano. Last, and
best, was State College of 1919. with
its clubs, athletics, publication
hoards, sororities and fraternities.
The various organizations were
represented by Olive Woodworth,
Donald Tower, Veta Merritt, Edith
Morrison, Francis Fitzgerald, David
Aaron.

The Junior stunt. consisting: of a
Grecian dance. was delightfully exe-
cuted by (lancch in white Grecian
costumes, with yellow ribbons and
garlands of smilax. The dancing to
the tunes of the pipes of "Pan"
(Earle Hosdowichl delighted not
only the May Queen, Miss Dorothy
Banner, ’20, but every spectator.
Those who took part were: Flor-
ence Van Ness, Madeline Cummings.
Elizabeth Archibald, l-l'elen Leitzell,
Agnes Rahe, Elsie Hairbnry, Ellen
Donahue, Mary Stripling, Florence

op‘lomores followed with an-
o. .. big success. The May pole
bearing aloft the Sophomore colors,
red and white, was danced around
by girls, daintin dressed in white
tarlatan with red ribbons, The May
pole dance was exceptionally suitable
to the occasion. and its graceful in-
terpretation delighted the large an-
dience present. Among the partici-
pants were: Nellle Parkhurst, Ger-
trude Southard. Beatrice Buchanan,
Alida Ballagh, Esther Cramer. Flor-
ence Stanbro, Kathryn Ball. Mar-
