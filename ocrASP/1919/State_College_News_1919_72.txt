in the evening there was a Campus
sing with “step singing " by the
various classes. The judges of the
singing were: Miss Jones, Miss
Bennett and Professor Douglas.
After keeping every one in sus-
pense as to who really won the con-
test, Professor Donglas ﬁnally an~
nounced that the decision ’of the
judges rwas unanimously in favor of
the class of 1920.

A new feature of this year’s sing—
ing was the SeniorJunior Moving-
up., The Seniors singing their fare-
well song gave over their places on
the steps to the Juniors; 1920, sing-
ing their new step song, took their
places as Seniors, The step song of

1920, which was very beautiful, was

given in ﬁne style.

The singing. was followed by danc-
ing on the Campus until 11 o’clock.
Greg'ware's orchestra furnished the
music.
