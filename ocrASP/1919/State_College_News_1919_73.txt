“The Yellow Jacket”

Min .Futterer Taken Leading Role

.\'n amount of praise is too much
for the work of l . .lfutt‘crer in
producing "The Yellow Jacket"
last l’riday evening in the Albany
High school alulituriniu. Besides
conducting the entire play, she was
compelled at the last minute to in~
t‘ct‘pt‘et the leading character her-
self. Several persons had at‘
tempted this part, but no one cap—
able conld be secured. Within
three days Miss l“tlllCl't‘t' mastered
the lines and put more ” pep " into
the whole cast titan had been evi-
denced before.

Everyone has highly couuneinlcd
the beautiful stage pictures brought
about by the magnilicent costumes,
elaborate stage properties aml light
ing ell'eets. Much of the material
was secured thrn the influence of
Miss Marl": ‘ c mem~
bers of the l"a st aided
in the make-up of the characters.
After the play an informal party,
with many "rats," was enjoyed by
the members of the cast, ushers,
and others who assisted in the
production.

Now that we have dealt with the
play as a whole, it is only titling
that we treat with each member of
the cast separately. and give to
them the personal mention due to
them. The biggest: aml pleasant-
est surprise of the evening was the
appearance of Miss Agnes Futtcrer
as the hero, \rVu llho Git, of the
play. Her interpretation of the
character was cleverly done. One
thing that made Miss li‘utterer's
acting so delightful was due to the
fact that she brought out the
poetry of the lines and got them
over to her audience. Another
member of the cast whose acting
was exceptionally line was Miss
Laura Macliarlane. Everyone en-
joyed listening to her lines, for her
voice is so clear and musical. Law—

From the moment he announced
the opening of the play on the

 

Chinese gong he had the audience
interested and amused. His was
surely a case where " actions speak
louder t " . r. i was
ably ' _ two assistant
property men, llenry Lacey and

Lawrence McMahon acted the
part of Wu Sin Yin, the pompous
governor of the province, very ad-
mirably, so that one does not won-
der why llne Jung liah, his little
second wife, was so desperately in
love with him. ll'rauees Duly por-
trayed [)ne Jung l’ah very daint-
ily. l'losely connected with the
second wife was 'l‘so, lter maid.
'l'his part was taken by Gertrude
(ireen, who showed the audience
that she could do clever character
work. (it was a shame that she
was beheaded so early in the play.)
Martha Stuart was the lirst wife
of \\'n Sin" Yin. She did some
splendid acting. The audience was
highly amused when she went to
heaven via a stcp~laddcr at the
command of a most realistic angel
(Vela Merritt.)

Reginald lJruee, as Tai li‘ah Min.
father of llue Jung halt, was all
that one could ask for a solicittwus
parent. The team work, if it might

   

he called that, of Suey Sin halt
(; ncs Nolan) and Lee Sin (Geo.

Schiavonc) was certainly
inendablc.
Second to Mr. Hill as an amus-
ing character, stands William Mer-
chant, Wn liah Din. lioth voice
and actions were made to suit the
part of this el'femina‘te young
prince. The four little llower girls
were See Quae Fab (Frances
Daley), Yong Soc Kow (Florence
Van Ness), Chaw Wan (Ethel
McKenna), and ‘Mow Dan Iiah
(Agnes Dennin.) To pick out the
sweetest was just as much a great
task to the audience as to the
young hero of the play. His ﬁnal
choice, Chaw Wan, proved to be a

MEMBERS OF FINE ARTS
DEPARTMENT VISIT
NEW YORK

 

liive of the girls of the Fine Arts
Department enjoyed a trip to New
York with Miss l’erine the week-
end of May 9th. They left liriday
night on the night boat, sitting
out on deck until about ten o'clock,
watching the search-light play on
the houses and trees along the
river. Sleeping in a state room
was a new experience to many of
them, and it was long past the
hour of midnight before their
laughter quieted down.

Saturday morning they left the
boat at seven o'clock. and went up
ll wit to the \Voodstork hotel,
where rooms had been reserved.
.’\t.tt-n o'clock they were met by
.\li:~.~‘ litlitlt R. Abbott, one of the
special instructors of the Metro-
politan Museum of .\rt, and who,
for the past four years, has met
State College parties. l~'or two
hours various styles of architecture
and painting were studied under
her guidance. Most of the alter~
noon was spent going from one
room to another, seeing the very
things they had been studying
about in the various classes. in the
evening they attended the Hippo-
drome, a novelty for all “newcom-
t-rs” to New York, so in spite of
the pouring rain a very enjoyable
day was spent.

Sunday morning there was a
visit to St. John the Divine Cathe-
dral, after which the girls went
down to Greenwich village for
dinner. A trip to Chinatown and
a ride on the liifth avenue bus lin—
ishcd the events of the day. They
took the eight o'clock train for
home. arriving in Albany tired but
happy.
