KEEP IT UP

We Were delighted to see the
interest displayed in assembly last
Friday morning in the proposed
constitution of the lloard of Fin-
aiiee. We are complimenting our—
selves on the results of the two let—
ters from seniors published in last
week's issue. Students actually got
excited over something preposed
in a Friday morningr assembly! It
was the disposal of future money
belonging to students we were vot-
ing upon. Perhaps this was the
incentive for the “ free speech ” we
were so glad to hear. At any rate,
opinions were voiced, valuable stig-
gestions were made, and a genuine
interest in and a ~knowlcdge of
what was going on were evidenced.
It’s rather late in the year, perhaps,
to encourage a continuation of this
sort of thing. Maybe now we‘ve
once started we won't need further
“moral snasion." it's as it should
be: students interested in student
affairs.

 

GO TO IT

Who said we wouldn't be glad
when the next two weeks are over?
Exams. this year loom tip rather
formidably. Profs. seem to think
they let us all pretty easy first semes-
ter, so will renew their efforts to
flunk us all this time. \Ve aren't
worrying though; we trust to
divine providence and last-
minntc cramming to pull us
through, 'That rainy weather has
'actuaily been a boon for hitherto
slackers. When it’s impossible to do
anything else, studying is a. rather
handy foi‘m'ot’ entertainment, and
,quite apropos just now. For once
‘wc're doing just the right thing.
Let's dig in and finish up with true
State College pep. Nothing has
failed during this unusual year.
.Don't spoil our record now.

MUSIC CLUB

 

The results of Music club elec-
tions, May 26, are as follows:

o. A. a. Home

‘Those‘oi us who were looking
for adventure last Saturday cer-
tainly got it. Alter a most de-
lightful. (i) ride of abont‘twentya
live miles, We hiked about live more
in nice, soft iniid. Once at the
ladder, we played a game of in-
door baseball, out of doors Then
as the furnished mob asked for
something to eat, we attempted to
build a lire to cook supper, but the
rain came and added to our num-
erous troubles. The "hot-dogs"
were eaten cold, and the toilet: and
sugar were brought back (exclud-
ing the amount dropped on the way
from the leaking wet bags). When
we came to our dear old trunk,
forty of us proved too many, and
half the crowd hiked to the state
road, Then when the gang was all
in. either standing or sitting, we
began our festivities once more.
Despite the mud on our shoes and
the rain on our backs, we all ar-
rived home a happy and cotitcuted
crowd. ‘22.
