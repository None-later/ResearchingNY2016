Last Friday morning in Student
Assembly the remaining articles of
the lioard of Finance were voted on.

as read. ‘

pleasure in noting the students’ in-
terest in such a measure as the board
of finance. '

The election of next year's board
was decided to be left until next
September.

The chairman of the Senior Ball
committee again urged everyone to
get a bid for the senior ball and to
use itl

cluded by singing "l Was a Little
l’rairie Flower."

NOWHERE IN PARTICU-

Dcar Big Sister Departments:

Did you know that you have a
two-year‘old baby sister? Well, you
have. Unlike the babies Dr. l’ainter
talks about, your little sister has re<
flexes and has always had them. The
interest of the instructors in the dc-
partment has been a constant stimu-
lus, and the infant’s reﬂexes or re-
actious are ever original and start-
ling.

Your baby sister's latest, most dur-
ing, and, let us hope, most successful
enterprise, has been the founding of
society like none we know of in any
of the eastern colleges—'l‘lw Physical
Education Society. “ llumphl" you
say, "that‘s nothing.” lint wait tin-
till you hear our aspirations and, later
on, our achievements. Many colleges
specialize in freshmen athletics. Due
to the war, We haven’t done as much.
even. as usual; but now, this society
wishes to bring hack the cross-coun—
try run. Vc wish to have a baseball
tcain, a football team, a tract meet
and other athletic events for fresh-
men only. One of our biggest dreams
is to see girls‘ athletics where it be-
longs—on a par with men’s. To ac-
complish this We would like the help
and cooperation of the athletic coun-
cil. Another dream is tn sec athletics

This is, of course, an immense
undertaking for a youngster, two
years old, but when you see the un-
usual wisdom which thc infant used
in chasing officers, you may have
conﬁdence that our dreams will be
realized.

The tirst meeting was held Thurs-
day, .\'lay 2‘), at noon. Those whom
we shall register as charter members
are all people, than and women. who
are intensely interested in physical
education. The most important busi-
ness of the meeting was the election
of officers. With keen foresight for

so young a child, Ed. Springman, _

’20, was elected president, and as his
right-hand assistant, the vice-presi—
dent, a most athletic and capable
young.r woman was elected—Ellen
Donahue also '20. he remaining
remaining otlicers are :~Secretary-rc-
porter. Lucile Rouse, ’21, and treas—
urer, Alida Currey, ’22.

Our sponsor, Mr. Maroncy, was
elected nnaimously as honorary
president for the ensuing year,
although he will not be con-
nected with the department. We
sincerely regret the loss of Mr.
Maroney as one of our instructors,
but we are most happy to say that
we‘re sure we will still have his io‘
tcrest. We still have Miss Bennett
and Miss Card as members, and we
know for a certainty that with such
instructors to stimulate us, our dream
will not vanish in smoko

Here's to ironing that you will hear
as much from us in the future as our
enthusiasm leads us to think you will.

COLLEGE srno AND
DANCE

Last 'l‘hursday evening another
college sing and dance was held on
the plaza from 7:30-11 :00. Not many
were out for the singr but a large
crowd enjoyed the dancing later.

One more event of this sort will
be held this year—on June 14, Alumni
Day. These are times we all like to
remember, especially just before
exams. c are sure they have come
to stay, and are 'hoping to have
some more as soon as college re-
opens next fall. Not many oppor-
tunities are afforded for get-togetl'ters
of the whole college except at games
and student assembly.

These (lnﬂCES are different in de-
sign and effect, We hope to im-
press '..3 with the idea of having a
gnod time here next year at the same
time they are going thru the intricate
"newness" of nuttriculation. We
have established a custom—a good
one backed by both students and
faculty.

 

LOST, STRAYED OR —--!

The editors of the "News" have
been very proud until recently of'two
bound tiles of the “News,” 1916-17,
1917-1918. These tiles have been Very
valuable, not only for reference, but
for the records they contain of all
State College activities (lining the
past two years. Just recently, these
copies, when they were urgently
needed, were unable to be found.
The publication otth was thoroughly
searched, but no bound copies could
be found. The editors are unwilling
to believe that these two volumes
have been stolen, so they now make
an appeal to the person or persons
who borrowed them to return them
immediately.

How To Mail a Letter

After writing it, place it in a
square or oblong envelope—round
ones are no longer_fashionablc. Seal
it on the back and write a legible ad~
dress on the front; then take a three—
ccnt stamp (two cent after July 1),
give it a good licking and retire it to
the corner—the upper right-hand cor-
ner, on the outside—never inside, as
the postmaster is not a clairvoyant.
Drop it in a letter—box and trust to
luck. If it’s a love letter it will
probably reach her all right, for
Cupid is a faithful postman and
carries a stout pair of wings. If it's,
a bill, by all means have it regis-
tered: otherwise, your debtor will
swear he never got it. If it's cash
for your tailor, heed the post-ofﬁce
warning: ‘Don't send money thru

. the mails.” Wait until you happen to

meet him on the street. If he sees

you ﬁrst, you lose.
