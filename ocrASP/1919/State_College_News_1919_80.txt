ALUMNI CONCERT

Irish and Scotch Melodies Were
Sun

Last evening in the Auditoriqu
a delightful musicale was given
umler the direction of Professor
Samuel 13. ﬁelding as part of the
commencement festivities. The
quartet consisting of J-ancttc Rel-
lcr, soprano; Lyra Waterhouse,
alto: Dr. Thompson, tenor; and
Professor Kirtland, baritone, rc-
peatcd the Scotch Cycle so much
enjoyed at the concert last month.
Most of the songs sung were an—
vient melodies with words by
Thomas Moore and Robert Burns,

The program was as follows:

Irish song's: Quartet, “Kath-
leen .\lavonrnccn; " soprano. ” |\'il-
larucy:" quartet, “The Minstrel
lioy;" baritone, “The Fields of
liailyclare;” quartet, "The Cruis-
keen Lawn;” tenor, "Avcnging and
llright;" quartet, “The Harp That
Once." ‘

Professor Beldingr was at the
piano. While the concert was
given for the alumni the public was
invited free of charge. We hope
that-next year able substitutes can
he found for the two senior ment-
bers of this delightful quartet.

 

THE. PEDAGOGUE

In this last issue of the “News”
we want to praise our 1919 year-
book. It’s all it was promised to
be and more. That clever border
around each page; the surprise of
the dedication; the numerous
sketches and snap shots, to say
nothing of real jokes! We don't
know who deserves the most credit.
We realize the amount of time and
energy that must have been spent
in securing advertisements, in col-
lecting and originating material. in
getting together the whole thing
and delivering it. before college
closed.

We advise any alumnus who.
hasn’t a.copy to see if one can be
secured. They're greah'and we ex;
tend. most hearty congratulations
to the editors, each and all. ,
