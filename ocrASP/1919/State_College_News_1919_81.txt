Goon-BYE AND
WELCOME

The present board of editors has
never before had an opportunity
to express its appreciation to the
old 'board for the Valuable aid given
it in continuing the publishing of
our “ oracle of student opinion.” It
has never made public its universal
grief at temporarily suspending the
close friendships established in our
work in the little ofﬁce under.,the'
stairs. It wishes to admit the diffi-
culties in maintaining the stand-
ards set 'by the members of the old
board. 1919 has established the
custom of surrendering the pub-
lishing of the ” News " to the new
board as soon'as it is appointed.
For this‘wc arc'very glad. It has
given us an opportunity to work
by ourselves with experienced
helpers to explain'difﬁculties. ‘

The present 'board also wishes to
thank the faculty and the student
body for their ‘ consideration in
criticising our ﬁrst attempts. We
hope to return in the fall with re-
newed zest. and clever ideas for
continuing the ” News;” a real, live,
student paper. We ask for the
hearty support of everyone, under-
graduates and alumni, so that, as
in this past year, each member of
State College will on Thursday
afternoons be eagerly watching the
table in the lower hall outside the
publication ofﬁce, or be watching

is mail for a small publication in
a government folder.

We are ﬁnding it difficult to wel-
come alumni and at the same time
bid good-bye to 'the‘ members of
’19. As doubtless others have
wished our present alumni the best
sort of luck in their application
of State College methods but in
that hackneyed place, f’ the wide,
wide world,’ so we too wish the
same for all our graduates. but

more especially for 1919.

 

AT ,THE END OF 1. PER;

rEcT YEAR

Yes, we ,know it wasn't abso.
lutel perfect. Nothing ever was
abao utely. perfect. 'But 1918-1919
has been so near the mark that we
are sure weeshall be forgiven if we
come' right out and call it perfect.

 

 

,’ When there was a war to win,

State College sent men into every
branch of the service. Then to
cap this she turned her campus
.into a drill-field and her buildings
into a combination barraCks and
mess-hall, and enlisted the rest of
her men in,thc S. A. T. C, And

when the armistice was signed she -

gave her attention just as cu-
thusiastically to bringing back
peace-time standards. '

In athletics State College sprung
_a sensation in the form of a ﬁrst
class basketball team. Statistics
show a record of 256 points in her
favor ‘against 203 for her .op-
ponents. She also backed that
team by some mighty cheering,
and she succeeded in establishing
a men's cheering section. She also
sent representatives to the annual
trackmcet, and, although they did
not’gct a place, they were there
just the same. And when it came
to intermural athletics there was
the same pep shown in interclass
contests.

in the social world the College
has established the traditions of a
campus (lance, and a senior ball
at the Armory. There has also
been a high standard of class func-
tions. Most important of all, the
New York State Student Volun-
teer Union held its annual con-
ference at State College.

In student government there
have been two innovations, namely,
the Dramatic and Art Association,
and the Student Board of Finance.
Have we been improving? Well.
I guessl

" You boast too much, someone
says. It was only a few days ago
that we heard a student from Wis«
consin University say, “ Some peo-
ple, who do not understand what
school pride is, give us the name
of being stuck up because we are
always boosting Wisconsin Uni-
versity. But we have something
to be proud of." So have we, and
it is only natural that we should
be proud of it.

On another occasion we heard
a State College student exclaim.
" Now. if we only had a.school like
that, we could have school spirit
and pride." We have enough now
to invoke school spirit and with a
little will and push we can have
more.

Then let's boost. Let’s root all
summer, wherever we are, for State
College; and when we return next
Fall keep on rooting. ’21.

PHYSICAL ED.

it

Welcome, thrice welcome to our
newest organization, the Physical
Education Society, and may it live
up to its ideals. especially in the
promotion of athletics at State C01-
lcge. The lack of greater activity
in college sports has been caused
as much by lack of interest, that
is united voiced interest on the part
of the students, as it has been due
to the lack of material in college.

With the material in college this,

spring it would have been possible

to have had a good varsity baseball,

team, but “ On account of the war"
We were unable to arrange a
Schedule because of the uncertainty
of the return of men from service.
it will also be impossible to have
varsity football this fall, but why
not have an appropriation and get
the necessary material and get an
idea of the ability of our men?
We might have interclass games,
as we have in the past. or play iri-
dependent teams, As for hockey
this winter and baseball another
spring, it is an accepted fact that
we are to have teams in both these
sports. ‘ .

As has been said before the real
reason why athletics have not had

 

a greater. place in college is the

 

 

 

 

’Vlack of a. demand for them on the

part of the students. A great num-
ber of the faculty have expressed
themselves as being in favor of a

ood athletic schedule at State Lol-

ege.

Let‘s all boost and not only put
State College on the map, but all
over the map!

SENIOR BALL’

One last plea for our final
splurge—the Senior Ball, Monday
night at nine o’clock in the State
Armory.

if it's possible that any alumni
haven't heard of this affair before,
hcark ye nowi it‘s the first real
affair to be given outside of col—
lcgc. lt is a sure advertisement
that State College is growing and
needs new and larger buildings. It
is a positive guarantee of the best
time yet, and the price is only $3.50
a bid (plus, of course, the ten per
cent war tax). If you‘re in town
to renew old friendships, greet new
alumni, and recall pleasant mem-
ories of this, your Alma Mater, see
a member of the dance committee
immediately! We want you all
there. Each organization of col-
lege is to have a booth in which it
may entertain its guests who do not
dance.

CLASS DAY

Class Day exercises took place
in the college auditorium at three-
thirty o'clock yesterday afternoon.
The editors of the " News " regret
that they were unable to secure for
publication, copies of the Class
i'rophccy and History before this
issue went to press. The following
are the Class Will by Fannc Plusch
and the H. Louise Stewart.
