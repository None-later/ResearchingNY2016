CLASS POEM

Herc will we~carve our names. We

 

gained the right by toiling
higher,

Lighter ’twas to rest us at the
noonday

By the riiis;
Or in the cold of winter sit beside
the cheerful fire.
But we climbed onward yet on
the way
Up the hills.

Carve our names here.
they‘ll be forgotten
As we pass on. Thousands will
come this way;
. lie onward hurled.—
Pass on! Let us go higher!— and
if we would not be forgotten,
Carve our names dccpcr— on the
world.
——1-f. Louise Stewart.

IS THIS YOUR TRUNK?

About a thousand pieces of per-
sonai bagga c go astray, each
month, accorr ing to a recent state-
ment by an express ofiieial. Very
probably, the trunks and suit cases
if college students are among them,
particularly at this season. There-
fore, it is important that you start
your trunk right, safeguarded with

‘the proper kind of address labels

and tags.

Most of the trouble is due to the
fact that trunks, unlike the stu—
dents, cannot spcak for themselves,
when the address label or tag
comes off. “ Old marks " from prc<
vions trips are confusing to the ex
pressman who usually send the
baggage some place where it
oughtn't to go.

if you do not want your vacation
ruined, or a romance shattered by
a lost trunk, follow these general
rules: '

Remove or cancel all addresses

of former trips.

Don’t entrust your lineries to a
single tag. The expressmen will
not accept your baggage unless you
have a label on it, in addition to a
strong ting.

Lie sure it is a strong tag. One
with a reinforced eyelet, and at-
tached with a heavy cord or wire,
is best.

Use good ink, never lead pencil,

.in writing the address, and do it

legibiy, giving all of these details:
Name of shipper; where from;
name of consignee; local address,
street and number; destination,
city; value (state in full), and date
of your shipment.

As an additional safegtiard,'piace
your name and permanent address
on the insitlc of your trunk; on the
lid, for instance.

se the same common sense
rules' when you ship a suit case, a
handbag or other baggage, and you
will see your best clothes again!—

Bureau, American Railway Ex—
press, 63 Broadway, New York.
