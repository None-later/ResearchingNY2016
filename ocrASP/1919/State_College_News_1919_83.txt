A SOPH’S *VERSION OF
STEP-SINGING

Moving-Up days may come and go,
Step singing has come to stay.
Bring out each good old song, boys,

Sing out each good old lay.

First come the grand old Seniors'
50111
With original words and tune,
Then Juniors' song so tender and
sweet
With the very essence of June.
. III

The Sop‘homores' song is merry
and gay
And full of life and pep.
0 Fresh are very good
youths
And are sure to make a rep.

for

Now all sing ” Solomon Levi "
And " Hail Professors Dear"
And “ College of the Empire State ”

in voices loud and clear.

And we- ﬁnish with Alma Mater,
The song we love the best;
The song books are fondly cuddled
And hugged close to each onc’s
breast.

Three cheers for old State College,
Faculty, students, and a .
And we’ll sing again right merrily
Wlheiil we come back again in the

ALMA MATER
(Tune: “'Where the Flag is Full
Stars ") -

it‘s fine to see the college halls
throughout our Empire. State;

And know the seats of learning that
have made its name so great;

We're proud of, them and what
they've done, wherever they
may be, ,

llut still, for us, there’s ornly one,—

and that’s our 5, .

Chorus

So, we hail thee, Alma
dear,—
To thee our pledge we give
That day by day, along life's way
To honor thee We'll live.
We will spread in Song and story
the fame of S. ‘. T.
That the world may know thy

i: cry.—
Alma Mater,——-here‘s to thee!

it's great to watch the busy town
from old Columbia’s gates,

And every Vassar girl the joys of
campus-life relates;

Cayuga’s waves are ever hlnc when
viewed from proud Cornell,—

liut to our own wc’ll e’er be true,—

ller praises we’ll haste to tell.

Within thy halls we've learned to
love the noble and the true,
And SERVICE shall our slogan

be, whatev’cr we strive to do.
May we. in all our deeds fulﬁll thy
purpose in our heart,
And follow where thou leadest still.
thn’ from thee we must part.
