interesth in competitive athletic:
than pink teas, attd organized his
work along these lines. Mr. Edward
Long, instructor in physics at State,
was Mr. Kennedy’s assistant manager.

It was due to the efforts of the
two managers that an employment

the soldicts. sailors and marines home
from service were placed in good
postttons.
