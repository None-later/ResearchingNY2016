new champions of the cloth of green
are to follow the numerals 1923. r c-
cording to hieroglyphic derivation
“23" means a rapid cxodus. Hitherto
the green and white cmhlems have
been borne aloft by vigorous and
noble spirits, \Vitli C}l..‘  'ant

:\ll(l welcome to our halls, \Ve hope
you’re going to crowd every room
so that the most pcniirioiis of gov~
crniiicnts must needs recognize our
crying needs for more space and
equipment.

(let posted early! Learn traditions
and get used to the idea of being
loyal to them. Our annual plea for
forming new ones is now indirectly
evident.

Don't let anyone bdittle your
opinion of your importance at col—

Get started early, Fl'liﬁlll in your

able to instil a portion into the
minds and beings of llllll-"t students,
to mingle with our fvlhiws in en-
thus' stic and impartial labor and
play, and \vithal to pain for ourselves
