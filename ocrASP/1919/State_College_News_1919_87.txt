The Passing of Cinderella.

THE quaint little childhood tale of the
poor kitchen maid is not so far removed

from recent reality.

For we all recall the staggering piles of
dishes, the dust-strewn floor, the tubs of
clothes, the treadmill task at the sewing
machines! Yes, Cinderella-like was the
housework of yesterday.

And now, the girl of 1920 looks to elec-
tricity —-most tractable of handmaidons—
as the fairy prince who makes life easier

and fuller.

tric motors sweep, wash dishes or Clothes;
clean. scour and polish; make ice or ice
cream, run the sewing machine and play

The development of the miniature motors
for the kitchen and electrical devices was

in the application of electricity for every
