Miss Ridwell, who is a most en-
thusiastic history student, was a
special student at State Colle c
three years ago. hile here, slie
was a pupil of Professor Rislcy's,
and to her are the history students
indebted for the many line maps of
Europe seen no the bulletin board
in the upper hall.

The “Times” also pays Miss
Bidwell a tribute which reﬂects
great credit upon Professor Risley.
for it reads: “Her comprehensive
grasp, and cleav entertaining pres-
entation makc tic study of history
a joy instead of a task."

community: I believe that they
are more -lgnorant III that regard
than almost any other part of the
State, where the full sigmhcance of
a degree from the teaching institu-
tion rated among the highest in the

country, Is known.

“ It ought to be your especial
task, as members of the Albany
branch. to support the college, and
to make it a force in this city.
Most people think of the institution
as it was in 1890, not as the college
licensed lo confer degrees as high
as any in the Slate, and ranked
among the foremost institutions of
learning by the boa-rd of regents.

"Just by way of comparison as
to our 1) ace in the community.
look at the war record we have
maintained. Our girls have done
remarkable work back home. but
it is to our boys that we look with
especial pride. During the Civil
War, of the possible 560 graduates
of the college, there were ninety-
nine who volunteered. in l917, of
the possible 335 graduates within
the ages of twenty—one and thirty—
one, thirty-four responded. There
were twelve undergraduates out of
sixty—six. who went in the Civil
\Var, but of the HS undergraduate
men in 1917, 117 joined the colors.
This did not, of course, include the
members of the S. A. 'l‘. C.

" And we are proud of our
ninety—nine per cent. undergraduate
response. We had a ﬁne war spirit,
and we have a ﬁner peace spirit
now, which \vill contribute toward
the greater realizalil'uns oi the col—
lege future.”

The ﬁrst deﬁnite accomplishment
of the Albany branch will be the
publication of a quarterly, which
will contain the news of all alumni.

Several of those present spoke
before the assembly. Letters were
read from presidents of the Utica
and New York branches of the as-
sociation. It was mentioned that
several ways in which the Albany
can act are: In hastening appro-
priations by the legislature, in sup-
porting athletics, in fostering dor-
mitories and needed buildings, in
preparing for the anniversary in
1920 of the founding of State Col-
lege.
It will doubtless be the'special
privilege of this branch to aid State
College. in any undertaking. and in
so doing it will be ﬁlling a long-felt
need.

said Dr. lirubarchcr.

“"ic League proposes a plan
which shall contain (1) an Inter-
national Court to adjust justiciablc
questions; (3) a council of concili—
ation for tum-justiciablc questions:
(3) an internatiomvl congress to
meet periodically for the formula-
tion of laws. rules or code of inter—
national relations; (4) an executive
body to administer the affairs of
the League.

"The court is to be composed of
eminent jurists. men who represent
justice. rather than nations. The
Council of Conciliation is to in-
clude rcprcscnlativcs of the major
nalions, enlarged from time to time
by adding,r representatives of the
purlicnlar nations who may have
questions under consideration. The
congress would contain representa-
lives of all nations in the league.
The league would use two powers
to enforce its decrees“economic
pressure and military force. No
standing arinivs are vt'inlcnmlatctl.
but the nations would be expected
to provide quotas’ for any army
whenever an emergency might
arise, in accordance with the war-
makiug powers of each nation. Un-
der our constitution congress
alone cuin declare war.

“The League would be an asso-
ciation of civilized nations. cauch
agreeing tn live under international
laws of comity and fair dealing.
No nation would resign its soveiu
cignty but each nation would re-
nounce practices that are delined
by the League a-s barbaric, uncivil-
izcd, unjust—therefore prohibited
by international law. The League
would stand toward individual na-
tions much as the nation stands
toward an individual citizon. Each
enjoys liberty under clearly do-
hned laws. That is, the League
would seek to give (leliiiiteiiess to
such international law as is now
and has long been recognized by
all civilized nations; and an offend-
ing nation would become an out—
law nation, subject to such restric-
tive measures as the League could
bring to hear on that nation.”

“The League would probably in-
ternationalizc some important wa-
terways," said Dr. Brubachcr. "The
German colonies and Turkish prov—
inccs would be similarly inter—
nationalized under various mem-
bers of the League as so-called
Mandaturies or‘agents. These are
the matters which many Ameri-
cans consider ‘entangling alli—
