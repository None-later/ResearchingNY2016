ARE WE WAKING UP?

In last week's “ News" an article
called “We :\rc \\"aking Up" was
publisiicd. We may bc—aloug cer-
tain iiucs, but so far. developments
in some other (iii'i'cliriiis arc absu—
hiicly "ing. Take. for ‘ ."invc.
the matter of our ldaukt-l tax. Of
course, We realize the ticlay neces-
sary in thc ch-rtion of our new [fi-
nance ioard, but it is now a week
since the members wcr L't tcd anti
no developments have as yvi becn
t-viuccd. Nothing can he carried on
without money, and the cxpcnscs nf
collch activities ‘4: secured thru the
board of himmt .' ‘tllllCSl for
budgets has been rcccivcd: there-
fore we suppose nothing has as yet
bccn done towards calculating the
amount of the tax.

Another line in which activity is
at a standstill is undc ssmen
rivalry. Where are the caps and hut~
ions that bclong to the restless
limsli? Why are the members of
'23 allowed to break every rule in
the "iiiblc" and 0. 'pc with no
chastiscmeni wliatsocic :\ little

The one branch in which we all
seem to he making most licai w: is
that of studying. Vcry good, Eddie,
but that is taken for granted. \Ve
would-he school trachch must neces-
sarily dclvc into pedzgogicai depths
rcgtiarly, but we mus ‘ . l revive
om" V ing mcnlaliti ju regu-
larly with social affairs. What has
happened to our former lunch-period
dansants? And is it a new rule that
even on Friday nights our gym must
be darkened at li):30 o’clock instead
of the former half-hour later?
Please, cvcrybody out to maintain
our standard of equality of work and
play. and let’s go~in cvcry direc-

This issue of the “News” might
be called the revival number. We
bopc every member of llic faculty
and student body will “hit: the trail"
and stay hit.

NO EXCUSE

From now on there will he abso-
lutely no caiisc for every student not
knowing his Alma Mater. With the
current issue of the "News" is a
supplement, slightly smaller than a
page of the College Song Book, on
which is printed the new tune. “Try
it on your piano ” and learn it and the
three verses that go Wit it.

STATE COLLEGE NEWS, OC'I‘OiilLR 9, 1019

H  U

Yes, it’s an old, old subject; hilt,
since there is no one who has too
much “pop,” and Economics 4
teaches us that “suggestion is
powerful in proportion to its mass
or volume." we venture to add this
modest hit to what has already
been salt.

We hope you will not make the
iuistak of thinking that. we con~
sidcr State College lacking in
"pep." She, as a College, and her
students, as classes and imliriduals,
have shown abundance of it. And
where much has been done, more
can be done, but satisfaction is a
dangerous thing. We must not bc
ciilirciy satisfied.

State College has grown in spite
of cramped quarters ainl inadc~
unatt- equipment. Last year she
put a winning basketball lcaiii on
the floor, and competed in the
inter—collegiate track meet, al-
though she had only forty men and
no basketball court or a track of
llt‘l' own. 'l'lii-rc's “pcpi” lint
with .'l little more of the same vim
and punch she can force stubborn
i-xccutivt-s to gi“ ll her more room,
and she can register enough lllt'tl
so that she will he recognized in
all sports.

.\nd as for the ela . .. ’2” has

big sistt-is ('(lll do for the Frosh
and how a l’rom should lic con-
ducted.

'22 has burn a good class, but
this year, as Dr Painter would
say. the odds art- against her. Sin-
will need to llt' “ on her toes" all
the time in ordcr to keep Minerva
from being (it-sccraled and the
campus from being trampled down.

.\iid “MW, ’23, we are hardly .' ‘
quainch with you, but we feel sure
that in spite of your numerals you
will hc here after mid-years. and
that you will keep the Soplis
worrying all the while.

So much for the classes, but it
is for the individual that we really
wrote this. We cannot analch all
the students in college to see if
they have “pep,” but we can ask
questions. Art- you going out for
athletics? .-\rc you helping run
things in your class. or are you
“too busy "5‘ Are you taking part
in collcge activities. or do you let
some one else do it? Maybe in days
trom- past you have taken part in all

official title, you feel discouraged.

so, you should read this r
from Gracc (i. Pinstwick’s poem, cuti-
ticd "Pep":

DID IT DIE ?

During a discussion among a
number of upperclassiiicn recently,
thc subject of ” Prmnelhuau " was
brought up. It is only among
upperclassnicn that such a subject
can be discussed. for i’rnuiethcan
seems to have just faded out of

past tivo years. [fond memories of
jolly lltcctings of this literary aml

These meetings were held on al-
ternate 'l.‘hursdny evenings in the
auditorium, and the programs prcu

large majority of the students in

took part, and the initiation of new
members always afforded a great
amount of fun.
