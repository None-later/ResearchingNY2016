WHY BE A “JOLLY

cs if it were not for one thing—-
llohhic forgot that the “jolly
junior" is also a part of t'r'dlcg'c.
He is the antidote for dullness, and
the om- hig means of preventing,r
our hallo of learning from hccom-
ing as .linrns described thcm.

Last week “as junior wcck in
State College. Who Within these
four walls does not know it? Who
did not participate in the anny-
mcnt of that week artually. or in
looking hack with nt Incum-
tics or thrilling,r in anticipation of
his own junior week? If thch he
.‘tltynttc, it is to him that we espe-
cially dedicate this message.

The “jolly junior" should have

 

 

 

his beginnings in the freshmen
partics: he should hud m the
sophrnnorc sotrccs: llt‘ should

 

lilossmn forth in gnat splendor in
the junior reception and prom;
and he should ripen into fruit in
the senior hall. 'llr: docs not than
hclong to anv om- cl _ . hot to all
of them. We call him “junior”
liccausc he is most evident during
the third year in college. hut he
stands for all our social life.
There an- those who tell us that
it is sinful extravagance to have
parties, $0er05 and prams. They
detract from our study. in short,
it is a lot of “ tnmmyrot." Those
people are the ones who would
have us “gang in stirks and come
out asses.” Our college vocahu-
lary furnishes us with names for
these neoplc, such as "grinds,"
“hook-worms." They are a most

 

unpornllar hunch. and their educa-
tion fails because they are out of

 

 

touch with humanity in general.
It were hotter, We sometimes think,
to go to the other exreme and ac-
cept Itorhhic Littt'ns' doctrine as he
expresses it in “Willie Uruwctl a
neck 0‘ Maul," when he says:

" It is the mmm, .l ken tIcr horn,
'l'hat's lJlllllilll in thc lllt sac lttc,‘

bhc shines sue ln-ight to \Vilc us

The second term has hcgtm and
we're i.- 'k again to scheduled time.
The re‘ord of aecmnplishmunts for
the lirsl. semester are more or less
satisfactory. "l‘wcnty-onc has
li\'c(l up to her reputation for
“pop.” and so far has more than
held her own wilh tltc junior
classes of previous years. " Well
hegun" counts. and with our he-
giuning there is no reason why this
nt‘ltlcsltrr should not be marked by
a superior showing on the part of
'Jl ’c arc in good training as a
result. of our ” warming up" last
term and we should he ready to‘

A SOPHOMORE SOIREE

The biggest event of lllc junior
year has Just passed. ‘or two
y *ars and a half the class of llJJI
has llccn planning for this week—
end, and the class is to he eou~
gralttlalcd upon the results. While
those memories of good times tll‘t‘
still with us, it . This as though the
time is propitious to liring up the
question of a sophomore soirec.
lt will he rcmemlm-cd that l‘JL’
was not allowed to have a party on
; count of war conditions, The
freshmen \rt-rt- "In-irks.’ for they
gave up their Ullc hig tinn- without
a murmur. 'l‘hcy consoled them-
sclrt's with the fact that this year
they would malo- up for it at the
soirec.

Acrording to the latest rt nrls.
lhc soplnnnores are not going to
have this hig function for the sim-
plt‘ l‘t-asrin that outside men are
lahoo. What fttu is a soirer where
there are to hr only a handful of
men to ahout a hundred girl
would mean that most of the girls
would hr ohligt-d to dilute together,
and that is not fair. (lirs in State
('olleg'c have all the omtortunitics
they want and don't \\'ant-—to
dunrt' with th‘ln, and only a few of
them have had tl - t)])])fll'lllllll)’ to
go to nppcrrlass functions with
"outside men." hence the reason
for vc'toing the Filll't't'-

Ve arr- at a loss to understand
why outs lc guests art- not allowed
to attch “no of the (,‘ollege func-
tions. The soirct- is not a cl;,.<
p.’ , hut a tradition. Does this
t‘nrlailment of men guests Incau
that at some future day we are
to have “tnanlt-ss” proms and
senior in s \\’e appl‘t‘clalt‘ the
fact that cass- parties ht- kept
striclly to llt' memhcrs of the
class, hut our svmpathy u'ocs out
to the class of l922. who have had
no party at all. 'l‘hcy have not
had one opportunity to show whal
lhev can do in the wav of a hi1.r
social affair. and as the victory
class of Stale College they deserve
at least a chance this year.

   

     

     

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

ROTARIANS VISIT COL-
LEGE

 

The Rotary Cluh of Alhauy was
entertained at College liriday,
January 23. l,.unchc0n was served
in the cafeteria at one to over a
hundred lintarians. After lunch a
short program was given in the
gymnasium hy mcmhcrs of the
physical education department.

 

 

 

 

My Dear Dr. l.lt'ttl)thltL‘l‘:

lege t‘tm’) you may be interested to
know that i am one of the Ittlecn
New York City teachers sent t|\‘t:l"
seas to visit the hatllcliclds, and
tltcrchy you are represented.

it is a privilege I so apprcriatc.
for every hit of the ground is really
sacred to our own country as well
as In our Allies.

ll \vould indeed he hard to de-
seriho my feelings while viewing
miles and miles ot shcll-torn Iields
with muddy, twitcr-lillcd trenches
aml Ina 'cs o harhcd wire, tanks,
and dcln knowing that it was
here that many of our own hoys
gave their lives for lltc lit‘tllllL't'—

to row after row of White crosses
with the Stars and Stripes floating

 

   

 

ahorc thcm, makes a sad picture
that years can never tlllll. I can
realize now why the hoys have

nothing to say alnmt it—thc horror
of it could never he put into words.

We were indeed proud when we
5 w the German stronghold in the
Argonne that our lioys capturrd
and hold. lt was the headquarters
of l’rincc lx'uprccht and we since
refer to it as "l)ltg‘ou ' (lt‘ link."
for they were all plastt‘l‘t‘tl. sonic
painted aml others papert-d. had
floors, fireplaces and even a marhle
hath room! We went down
through the pa go from the en-
trance to one of the several exits
cuch carrying a lighted t‘audlc.

We also wcnl all through l"ort
Van. .ml saw the galleries whcrx.

'l‘he (ill-fool, gallery of the Hill-

interesting. There were carvii ‘

Anothrr thing we saw was the

ready to go over the top when a
