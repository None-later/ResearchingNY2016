'The Line‘He Clrried

Biéhop,,Watterson, of Nebraska,
was never at a loss for an answer
to impertincnt questions. One day
he met'a man on the train who mis-
took him for a traveling salesman,
and started in to. quiz the Bishop. "

“ Do you represent a big house?
he began as an opener. ,

“The very‘ biggest on earth,’ re-
plied theBishop, with a twmkle Ill

“ V hat’s the- name of the IIrm?"
continued the questioner.
' “Lord and Church," smiled the

houses anywhere? ' V
“ Oh, yes, Indeed; branch houses
all over the world.”

“,l—lum! 'l‘hat's queerl Never
heard of them. Is it boots or
shoes " ,

" Neither.“‘

“Oh. I see: dry goods, I sup-
pose?”
" Well, yes; they do call my ser-

Did I! She Was Told
“Now remember, Mary.” the

.teacher said just before the school

exercises. “if you forget some of
the words when you are singing
your song don't stop. Keep right.
on. Say tum-tum-tummy—tum, or
something like that, and the words
will come back to you and nobody
will know, the, difference. Now
don’t forget.”

On exhibition (lay little Mary
electrified her audience with
". and she wears a wreath of

roses
Around her tummytum-tnm.”

He Lived There, All Right

An anxious father got “wind of
the rumor that his son was leading
rather a convivial life at college.
But the son strenuously denied the
charge in letters to his fatherfﬂ‘ti'll
unsatisﬁed, the father made an un-
expected visit to his son’s lodging-
plaec. and giving the bells manly
pull was met by a grim-laced laud-
aty. ~ .
“,Does Mr. James Smith live
here?” asked the father. ', '

“ He does," replied the landlady.
" Bring him right in." '

Not Famous. but Should Be

Mr. and Mrs. John Rovin, of
Temeswar, Hungary, are not
famous, but they have every reason
to be when one thinks of what they
accomplished: the husband dying at
the age of 172 and the wife at the
age of] . hey had been married
for 148 years, and at.- their death
left a wee little orphan child-—
aged 116 years »,

 

 

He Followed the Text

The father wanted to test the
generous nature of his son. so as
the boy was going to church one
morning he said:

" Here. Benny, are a quarter and
a penny. You can put whichever
you pleaSe inth contribution box.

Benny thanked his papa and went
to church.

Curious to know which coin
Benny had given, his papa asked
him when he returned, and Benny
replied: , ’

“Well, Papa, it was this way.
The preacher said the Lord loved
a cheerful giver, and l knew I
could give a penny a good deal
more cheerfully than I could give a
quarter, so I put the penny in.”

. What His Mother Knew

Mrs. Ruth .VlclEnery Stuart’s imi-
tation of thenegro dialect is excel-
lent. and her small son. who was
very proud of her accomplishment
in this line, frequently boasted of
it among the other children. Once,
when some of his schoolmates were
rauutini,r the accomplishments of
their several mothers, he was over-
heard to declare:

"Well, my mother is smarter
than any of yours. She can speak
two languages.”

“ What are they?" demanded his
companions.

“ White and colored."

 

Inst 3 Starter

r\ crotcher old farmer had
trouble with his neighbor, and as a
result sought his counsel.

“ want yeow ter write him a
letter an‘ tell him this here foolish—
ness hex got ter stop," he declared
lirmly. “i know what I want ter
say, but I ain't got the larnin’ ter
put it just right."

" What do you want to say? " the
lawyer asked.

“ Wa-all. begin by tellin’ him that
he's the durudest. lyin'est, thievin’-
est, low~d0wnest skunk on airth—
and then work no."

 

He Had One Question

Three men had come to see a
prosperous shoe manufacturer of
Rhode Island. He had invited
them to go over his new factory.
The day was warm. and one of the
guests was stout. At the factory
they took an elevator to the top of
the building, the seventh floor.
where the cutting was done. Mr.
Blank then conducted his guests
through the factory, following the
course that a pair of shoes would
take _ in the process of making.
When the party at last reached the
hrst ﬂoor the stout man wiped his
heated face and turned to his host)

“There is one question, Mr.
Blank, that I should like to ask."

“And what is that, sir?"

“I should like to know if we are
still in the State of Rhode Island?”

 

Thus a Coolness Arose
‘f Did you ever have a cold," ins
qutred the plain citizen, "that you
couldn't get rid of?"
"No," answered the purist, “If
I had had I would have it now.”

 

Her Valuation

Ifittlc Mary looked at the penny
which had been given to her for the
collection plate with evident satis-
faction. and then. nestling close to
her aunt, whispered: “How much
are you going to give? "

Her aunt, Opening her hand, dis-
played a quarter of a dol ar.

‘-' h," exclaimed h’laryexcitedly,
“don't do it! It isn‘t worth it! ”
