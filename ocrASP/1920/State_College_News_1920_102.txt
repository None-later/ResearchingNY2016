BASEBALL

 

in assembly Friday the (liitET‘
tion arose as to whether baseball
should be supported as a State
College sport. The question was
ﬁnally answered by votingr an ap—
propriativ’ui of six hundred and
twenty-live dollars for this branch
of athletics. But thoth the bud~
get was passed, we do not think
it was passed with enough spirit
on the part of the student body.
There was a good deal of hesita-
tion, and in some cases students
did not think that baseball should
be supported at all.

‘Now. let us consider last year's
baseball record carefully, and see
if this attitude on the part of stu—
dents is justlied. The very first
game playul last year was with
St. Stephen's on their diamond.
it was an overwhelming victory
for State College. To logical
minds this should show that with
the same amount of practice the
Purple and Gold men were able to
more than hold their own with
colleges far.outnnlmberini;r them
in material to pick from. it is
true that later in the season the
same team defeated State by a large
score. but that was due to prac-
tice only. Our nine had not had
the advantage that hours of drill
gave their opponents.

his year we have as good, if
not better, material than last ycar.
VVC know this maicrinl will l)t‘
properly developed. \Vith the ad
vantage of a year’s experience our
nine is goiiu.r to make a record of
which we shall be proud. Are we
going to hesitate about appropriat-.
ing the small sum of six hundred
and twenty-live dollars on these
prospects? Instead we should get
behind these men, and show them
that we are going to back them up
with the good old spirit of bygone
d

ays.

Rather than mince over a budget
of six hundred dollars. it would
be more like State College to raise
it to a thousand, and say, " Go to
it, boys! We’re back of you, win
or lose! Your interest is our in-
terest!"

FRESHMEN ADVISORS

One of the recent State Col-
lege institutions which deserves
especial praise is the freshman ad-
visor system. This is an arrange-
ment by which the youngest class
in the college is divided into small
groups, and a member of the
faculty is assigned to each group
as a spatial guardian. .This fac-
ully member acts as a big brother
-.*r sister, as the case may be, and
be carefully considers the welfare
of his group and answers any ques-
tion or straightens out any difﬁ—
culty which may arise In any
branch of college activity. The atl-
vantages of such an arrangement
can readily be seen. The freshman
is made to feel more at home. He
no longer feels like an outcast, and
he has someone (in whom he can
depend in case of any unforeseen
trouble,

And the best part about the ad‘
visor system is that it has worked.
it is not one of those beautiful
theories that don‘t amount to any—
thing. in this year's class there
is only one freshman who has not
made the acquaintance of his ad—
View:

ALL OUT FOR THE STATE
COLLEGE ORCHESTRA

3 \\'ho is there : State. College or
anywhere else for that matter, who
d u-s not enjoy good music? (ll
course there may be some who do
nut. lull on the whole everybody
likes to hear a good orchestra
play. State College is making,r an
rlTort to have that hind of an or—
chestra. and we all know that it
met with sure ‘5 last year. This
year it is going to meet with
greater snr . if each one who
possibly run will make an effort
to llt'lp the cause.

If you are not professionals, or
very nearly professionals, in play-
ing some musical instrument, don't
stay at home, but come to orchestra
practice just the same. You can
all do your hit to help the Orchestra
alone and incidentally get some
practice in playing at the same
limc.

lianjns, mandolins, guitars, and
all other iuslrtnuenl‘s of that kind
are needed. if you do your bit for
the orchestra. you will also be (lo-
in;r your bit for State College and
for your Alma Mater.

 

 

THE COLLEGE
CAFETERIA

 

From a Student's Point of View

While the rollce'e lunch room is
maintaiucd as a field for student
practice, lunch room planning,
., Hing. serving, and accounting;
in the Home Economics Depart—
ment, it has also as its purpose the
accmunmdatiou of the faculty and
student hotly of State College.
This is done by serving regularly,
live days a week, a noon-day lunch—
I.ahoratory products from
ass in foods are from time to
limc used as a supply to the menu,
thus furnishins: a practical outlet:
for the class work. Combined with
this, are the efficient services of
th- regular lunch room force which
result in appalling and reasonably
priced products. Everyone must
have noticed the attention that has
been paid in regard to the attrac-
tiveness of the room itself which
is well arranurtl and lighted.
Flowers add to the air of hospital-
ity and welcome that pervades.

 

  

Our lunch room is an index to the

 

principles for which the Home Eco-

uomics Department stands and
these are worthy principles. May
we appreciate the college lunch
room, and accept its welcomel

MEN‘S CLASS IN

 

CHORUS SINGING
ORGANIZED
When we heard Professor

Thompson had started a class in
chorus singing, we all feltthat at
ast we were going to get a founda--
Lion on which we might build some
real good college sings, But we
find we have the ﬁrst story of our
buildingr as well, or a class, in
chor singing for mcn.has been
organized.

Mr. Candlyn, organist at St.
Paul‘s Church, is directing the work
of this class. lc says. although
twenty members of the Men’s Glee
(Llub have enrolled, he would \vcl»
roll“: as many more Illt'tl. if he
would get them. He will be par—
ticularly interested in men who can
sing, lirst tenor or second bass, as
there are not enough in the class
who can sing; lhcse parts. The
work the class will cover has not
yet been planned, as the nature and
the amount of work done will de~
pt'lltl, to a great extent, upon the
llllt'l'trﬁt shown by the men and by
the duuree of their attainment. The
class meets in the auditorium nu
‘v'edncsd r and 'l‘hursday after-
noons at 4:50,

lCri-ryont- rill llt' glad to hear
that the men s quartet has bt‘cu rc-
organized. 'l‘hcodorc t'ussavant
will sin).r first tenor, John ...i—
rant. Second tenor, Charles Reilly.
‘ , and t'harles ("irubeL sec-

 

 

 

 

 

 

hare enrolled in this class, but it
seems as though even more might
talte an interest in this work. It
means college credit for the men,
and better sings for the college.
Help the college and. incidentally,
help yourself by joining up.
