The Donkey May Ride

The jocular old party was about
to board a street car on a pouring
wet (lay. "Ah. conductor," he in-
quired, " is this Noah’s ark of yours
lull?” .

“ No, sir," the conductor in-
stantly retortcd; “ there’s just. room
for the donkey. Come on, Sir."

“ See the dancing snowflakes."

“Practicing for the snowball I
suppose.” I
A Poor Catch

The station master, hearing a
crash on the platform, rushed out
of his room just in time to see the
cxprcssthat had inst passed through
disappearing ’round the curve and
a disheveled young man sprawled
out perfectly flat among a confusion
of overturned milk cans and the
scattered contents of his traveling
bu -'.

EWas he trying to catch the
train? ” the Station master asked of
a small boy who stood by, admir-
in};r the scene.

"He did catch it," said the ‘boy
happily, “hut it got away agatnl"

 

Feminine Diplomacy
” Well, Dorothy,” said her father
on Sunday afternoon, “shall we
have a walk or a car ride? "
” I razer walk,” little Dorothy re-
plied, “if ’on will carry me."
She Wanted the Best
"Madam," said the doctor, “I
shall have to paint your husband’s
throat with nitrate of silver."
"Please use nitrate of gold, (loc-
tor,” exclaimed the proﬁtcer’s wife.
“The expense is quite immaterial."

 

Lad and Gentleman

A smart y dressed woman was
sitting in an omnibus when a quiet-
looking young man, in getting in,
accidentally trb on her dress.

She talked to him for ion minutes
and wound up by saying: ”
gentleman would have apologized.
The young man bowed and calmly
' "A lady would have given

Obviously
“My friends," inquired the long-
laced orator, “what would you do
if you expected the end of the
world in ten days?"
From the gallery floated a voice:
“Wait ier it."

 

'l‘oimuy—“ I'a,>w,hat is an equi‘
nnx?"

l’a—=~“ Why er—it is——ahem!
For goodness‘ sake. Tommy, don't
you know anything about myth-
ology at all? An equinox was a
fabled animal, half h'orse, half cow.
Its name was derived from the
word ‘equine’ and ‘ox.’ it does
seem as. if these public schools
don’t teach children anything now-

5 Customer—-“ What do you mean
by selling me that stuff you called
hair-restorer, and telliny,r me it
would restore my head to its orig-
inal condition? ”

('hemist—"Didn’t you like it?"

Customer—~“No, I didn't. If ‘I
had kept on much longer, I should

Many stories are told of a former
Canadian hishnp who had passed
his youth in Scotland. but ﬂattered
himself not' a little (in his speech
and manner. One day he met a
Seotclunan, in whom he said at last,
ahruptly, ” lloo lam;r hae ye been

“I don‘t know; why? " ‘

he gets stuck on himself."

Couldn’t Eount His Ribs

“How many ribs have you,
johnny?" asked the teacher. “I
don’t know, ma'am,” giggled

Johnny, squirming): around on one
foot, ” n so awful ticklish I
never could count ’cm,"

 

Handing ’Em Down

Johnny. \\"licn are you going,r to
