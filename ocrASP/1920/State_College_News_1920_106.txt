ANOTHER FORM OF
RIVALRY

 

Who's going to be the first to
,pay his blanket tax? That is an
important question at this time.
Freshmen, do you know that it’s
an honor to be ahead of the other
fellow in this? Well, it is, and the
class all of whose members pay
their blanket tax lirst is the honor
class of the year. So start saving
your money now, and put it away
where it will be handy when the
office on the second lloor opens for
business.

’24, here's a chance for you to get
the start of Abuse sophomores.
"23, it would be a shame if you let
the irosh beat you to it. And
juniors and seniors, you surely are
not going to let the umlcrclassnien
“put one over on you, \ ' io': going;

tion as soon as possible.

Perhaps that is why so many of the

would be better to find out first if
'such things were worth going to.
Anyway, thch were not nearly as
many students there as might have
come if they were really interested

le.

The students that did come were
not nearly noisy enough. In fact,
1hc only organized cheering was
done by a small group of frosh dur-
ing the entire program, and by the
sunk and fresh teams that took
part in the tug-of-war. This lack

ONCE AGAIN

 

On the voting on the budget
which took place last Week and the
week before there was much dis-
cussion over the “Quarterly.” In
the end nearly everyone voted in
favor of it, but still there Seemed
to be seine feeling against it. it is
perfectly true that many of us do
not care‘to read the Quarterly or
would not miss it if it were not
published. lint there seems to be a
way in which we can look at the
subject more broad-miiidedly.

We are all interested in our Alma
Mater and in the things which help
in its advancement. The "Quar-
terly" is one thing which adds to
the breadth of State College. When
we stop to think of the number of
affairs and of the number of inter-
ests at State College, the more we
can count, the more pride we feel
in llt‘l' achievements. If the
“ Quarterly ” were not in existence,
we would have just one less thing
to enumerate. Of course the tax
may be a little larger, but before
long we shall have forgotten that
we had to pay that extra dollar or
two, lint, on the other hand. pco-
plc from outside will look at State
t‘ollugc with more respect \vhrii
they realiZi- tlial she is able to sup»
port a paper of its high a standing
as the “ Quarterly",

So don’t you all agree that we can
.~a ritice our own personal fi-clings
against it, if Wt‘ have illl)’, and think
of the cause as a point in favor of
State t'ollcgc? ln doing,r this we
can trivi- the Quarterly our livarticst
support.

 

TRIP TO SCHENECTADY

Seniors juiiioi., sophomores,
fri-shiiii-i myriu'vc always intended
to go to he‘: nicctady ever since you
came to Albany whether it was livv
wet-ks ago or a hundred and ﬁfty-
live. And it’s always been the some

you'd do with yourself, if you
should get there. \'Vcll here‘s your
chance; tn—inurrow meet at college,

to take lllC 111th) car to Schenec—
lady. As for the. crowd, of course.
we haven't goth-ii them all tagged
and czttttlogtlt‘d, at quite this early
date, but tliei'v’ll be a crowd there,
don‘t worry, and Miss hay is going
to clizipi'ron us, and incidentally
clear up all the points on the local
history of Schenectady that we're
doing to know after we've taken
Course ll. Oh, one thing more,
probably not the least thing either,
if you had your breakfast at

just to'fortify our historic legs for

than putting salt on its tail and
