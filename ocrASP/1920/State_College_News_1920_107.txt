team. , .

'l'he tttu-ol-war between the

vantage over the trash—perhaps
20 yards or more. The rivals
t‘llt't'l‘(‘(l each other heartilv, and all
made their way to the t\. ll. S. for
the intcrc 's basketball game.
This game was entirely onc-
sirlrd. The senior team managed
to hold itself far in advance of the

 

other team consisting of Linclc, ’22;

Johnson, ’23, Reilly, '23, Flynn, ’23.
The thin! score was 18-3 in favor of
the seniors. This last event ended
the athletic events of our first
("ampns Day.

The activities for the evening
started with a dance on the pave-
ment, for which the Milne High
School orchestra tnrnishcd the
music. Then a sing was held in
the college auditorium for about an
hour. Mr. Cadlyu played. and the
State College quartctte gave sev—
eral selections. The members of
the quartette were Charles Reilly.
Theodore and Joint Cassavant, and
Gruble. Their singing was very
much enjoyed and ardently ap-

 

,
plaudetl. We sang all the old songs
til the college son hook, and
tht'yutIe felt that col egc sings are
really worth while, and we should
have more of them.

Campus Day closet! with a dance
ill the gym, which lasted until
eleven. Milne High orchestra
played, and everyone had a good
little. Campus Day has certainly
proved to he a success, and it is
hoped that this institution will he
kept up attd made a college tradi-
tion. '
