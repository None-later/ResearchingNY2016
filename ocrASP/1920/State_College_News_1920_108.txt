Nobody Likely to Remember
in the United States, Scotland
has a great reputaton for learning,
and a lady who went to that coun—
try Irom Boston expected to ﬁnd
the proverbial shepherd quoting
Vergil and the laborer who had
Burns by heart. She was disillu-
stoncd in Edinburgh. Accosting a
policeman she inquired as to the.
whereabouts of Carlyie’s house.
"Which Carlyle?" he asked. .
“Thomas Carlyle." said the lady.
" What does he do?” queried the
guardian of the peace.

“ l- was a writer——but he's
dead.” she faltered.
“ Well, Madam." the big Scot in-
formed her. “if the man is dead
over live years'there‘s little chance
of ﬁnding out anything about him
in a big city like this.”

 

He Knew His Friend
I Berkowitz and Sternherg. travel-
ing salesmen, met on the train.

“I ave just come from St.
Louis. where -1 did a tremendous
business," said Berkowitz. " How
much do you think I sold?”
“How should I know?” replied
Sternberg. '

."‘Of course you don't know, but
vhat do you guess?"

“ Oh. about half."

" Half of vhat?"
