DRAMATICS AND ARTS
ASSOCIATION PLANS

_ The Dramatics and Arts Associa-

tion plans for the college your
always attract a good deal of atten-
tion, and this year's plans are
bound to receive their share of in-
terest for they are particularly
good.

The big event, of course, is John
Drinltwater's lecture which will be
given Tuesday evening, February 8,
in Chancellor's Hall. This English
playwright, whose great play,
" Abraham Lincoln," has been
awarded the highest praise in ,Lon-
don and in New York, will talk to
us on "An English Dramatist's
View of Lincoln.” The association
is getting this famous lecturer
through the Lee Keediek lyceum
bureau. Although this bureau

our association hopes that the
students here will aid in this
work of advertising both here
and in the neighboring cities.
The lecture will cost the asSociation

student fund, and the remainder, it
is expected, will be raised by the
admission fees. . C. '1‘. students
will be adtnittcd free of charge, but,
out of courtesy, it is expected they
will take balcony seats, so that the
orchestra will be left for the out-
siders, who will be asked an admis~
sion price of $1.0 .

The Dramatics Class will present
three onc'act plays about two
‘wceks before mid—years. The plays
have not yet been chosen, but the
class is working over plays now
and will decide upon three, very
shortly. In June, the long play—
lhree or four acts-— will be given.
'l‘hese plays will be presented in
the Albany High School auditor—
ium, and S. T. C. students will be
admitted free.

will read “Quality Street," by
James M. Barrie. This is a charm‘
