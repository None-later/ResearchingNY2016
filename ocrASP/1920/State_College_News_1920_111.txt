the "News" for this year. Boost
ourselves; boost each other; boost
our activities; and, in so doing,
boost our college.

A SINGING COLLEGE

 

Last Friday, State College stud-
enlts were given a treat by Way of
a real live musical program, given
under the direction of Dr. Thomp-
son, At the end of the chapel
period, Dr. Thompson announced
that this is the beginning of a
movement to make State College-
"a singing college " like Prince-
ton, Hamilton and others. We
think that especial credit should be
given to those who are the leaders
in this worthy movement. If there
is anything Which will make as-
semblies more interesting and
brighten up the whole aspect of
college life. it is music. The entire
student body should got behind the
Music Department, and make it
possible for them to continue their
excellent beginning.

INTERCLASS BASKET-
BALL

How many State College stud—
ents have read the basketball sched-
ule published on the bulletin board
in the main hall? There are some
good games yet to come in the
lnterclass League, and all of them
will be played in the Albany High
Gymnasium. where there is plenty
of room for everybody. Class
spirit hasn't been very noticeable
this year. So, seniors, juniors,
sophomores, and freshmen. here is
a chance for you to make up for
your very evident lack of ” pep "
during the ﬁrst month of the col-
lege year, Corre out to these
games in a body. Get some rousing
cheers, and.givc some organized
class, yells. College will never
really be college without class
spirit. So get in line. Last week
there were‘ from ﬁﬁty to seventy
ﬁvestude-u‘t’s outta the basketball
games. This week there should be
ﬁve hundred.‘ ‘

ﬂowers. why not go to Danker‘s or '

 

HELP YELL

 

Rooters are invited to visit the

. ll. 5. gym and help the boys in
their endeavors. A little noise in a
basketball game means a lot in a
cl05e ﬁnish for your class team.
Join the throng. Use your voices.
,Wa‘bch the results.

" Take for example" that 1921
cheering sqluad. Note the deep,
rich, contra to yells. Four years
ago they had regulation “high-
pitched, squeaky Frosh voices. See
what four years attendance and
cheering at interclass basketball
games has done for them and their
team.

Said the senior to the freshman
(Reply to Oct. 14, 920):

“Twixt you and me is a mighty
chasm,

We represent the Cx‘tl‘clnCS, my
ricn

You the beginning, I the end.”

The Freshman made reply,
As he winked his honest e e;
” Well, when I hear you cicer, old

man
Gee, I'm glad that I began."
A Side-Linc Jo'hnny.

ON SUNDAY

 

Some say—and they comprise
the majority of State College’s
most loyal students—that we as a
whole lack true College spirit. Just
as there is reason for the predomin-
ance of certain ideas among us,
there are causes justifying those
who have arrived at this conclusion.

We must admit that State Col-
lege, unlike other colleges, does not
have dormitories to make us feel
like In. college unit. Sundays of all
times are days when we fall apart.
We wonder what would be the re-
sult of Sunday afternoon got-to-
gc‘tliers. VVou‘ld these be a means
of bringing us in contact with one
another in a pleasant way? Would
not the Green room make an ideal
place to write the " h‘omc letter " or
to read a good magazine? Would
not your letter have less of a home—
sick tone if you had your friends
about you when you write it? How
would you like to gather in some
such a way as a Sunday got—itc-
gielt‘lier?

PATRONIZE OUR ADVER-
TISERS

 

Perhaps it is a wcl‘l-iworn phrase!
Does that make it less applicable?
We voted tor the “News” appro‘
priat‘ion, bwt our responsibility for
its success does not end there.
Without the money gained through
advertising the “News” would not
be able to go on. We can’t expect
business men to give us their sup—
port and we give nothing in return.
When you buy stationery, pens,
notebooks, elte., remember Schnei-
Me’s, Brennan’s and Clapp's. If
you are looking around for a Prom
dress, why not let Cot‘trell & Leon-
ard’s or Stecfel Bros, or Hicwe-tt's
Silk Shop show you what they
If you are buying Her

Eyre’s? if our ﬁavoritc store does
not advertise, tell the " News "
about it. They owe us an ad. Be-
fore you start shopping, glance over
the “ News ‘ " adventiserments.

And when you do shop just men~
tion that you are from State Col-
lege, to show people that their ads

are bringing results. It would be _

lots easier for us ail—seekers, if
storekeepers only knew by experi—
ence and not by our word alone.
that State College patroiiizes them.

“ COOPEROATE WITH
THE CO-OP ”

No college undertaking can be
the success that it should he unless
it is supported by every last stud-
ent. It holds true in the cascpf the
Devon Book Shop as well as in any
other organization. Not but that
the student body has been support-
ing the Co-ops, and most hcan’til‘y
too, because they realize more and
more eae‘h day what a wonderful
privilege it is to have such a shop
in college. But a few of the stud—
ents order books and then forget
or neglect to call for thciii. They
little realize how greatly this incon-
veniences the C'o-op. In the ﬁrst
place, all bills must be paid within
thirty days or it is necessary to re-
turn thc books. This means that
the books MUST be called for just
as soon as they come in. if you
are not sure whether or not the
book you ordered has come, look at
the lists posted on thc bulletin
board outside of the Shop door.
That will tell you. Please give
your attention to this matter, and
a little more promptncss. Cooper-
ate with the Co-op.
