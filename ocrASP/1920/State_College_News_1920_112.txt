TOMS are so inﬁnitesimal that to be seen under the most
powerful microscope one hundred million must be grouped.
The atom used to be the smallest indivisible unit of matter.
When the X—Rays and radium were discovered physicists found
that they were dealing with smaller things than atoms—with
particles they call “electrons.” .

Atoms are built up of electrons, just as the solar system is
built up of sun and planets. Magnify the hydrogen atom, says
Sir Oliver Lodge, to the size of a cathedral, and an electron, in
comparison, will be no bigger than a bird~shot.

Not much substantial progress can be made in chemical and
electrical industries unless the action of electrons is studied. For
that reason the chemists and physicists in the Research Labora-
tories of the General Electric Company are as much concerned
with the very constitution of matter as they are with the devel-
opment of new inventions. They use the X-Ray tube as if it
were a machine-gun; for by its means electrons are shot at tar-
gets in new ways so as to reveal more about the structure of
matter.

As the result of such experiments, the X-Ray tube has been
greatly improved, and the vacuum tube, now so indispensable in
radio communication, has been developed into a kind of trigger
device for guiding electrons by radio waves.

Year may thus be spent in what seems to be merely a purely
“theoretical” investigation. Yet nothing is so practical as a good
theory. The whole structure of modern mechanical engineering
is reared on Newton’s laws of gravitation and motion—theories
stated in the form of immutable propositions.

In the past the theories that resulted from purely scientiﬁc re-
search usually came from the university laboratories, whereupon
the industries applied them. The Research Laboratories of the
General Electric Company conceive it as part of their task to ex-
plore the unknown in the same spirit, even though there may be
no immediate commercial goal in view. Sooner or later the world
proﬁts by such research in pure science. Wireless communication,
for example, was accomplished largely as the result of Herz’s
brilliant series of purely scientiﬁc experiments demonstrating the
existence of wireless waves.
