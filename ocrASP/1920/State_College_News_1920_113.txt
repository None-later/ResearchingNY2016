étive the Fraternity corresponded
with over two.hundred- and ﬁfty

’ high school principals in- the State,

-to obtain the names of men in their
graduating classes who might be
interested in entering the State Col-

Land to that end it desires to make
:the college as attractive as possible

DRAMATICS AND ARTS ASSO-
CIATION

Continued from Page 1.

: lis'h critic has said that after read-

ing this. one feels as if he had been
laid away in lavender.

The association is also planning
another trip to New ‘ork—even
a bigger, better one than last year’s.
This trip is for morn-hers of the dra-
matics class and for any upper
classmcn who-are interested. Those
who go to New‘York will see one
or more of the best plays that are
on, and will do some extensive
Journeying about the city to places
of interest. ,

.Due to the fact that ao much of
the association's fund will be used '
for dramatic urposes, the art side
of the assomation is planning to'
save its energies'till next year when '

art will be emphasized.
