THE “ NEWS " FILE

While there is much being said
about college spirit and college
traditions, we would like to say ll
few words which we consider
closely applicable to both. There
is, as probably most State College
students know, a lile in the
“ Tcws" ofﬁce containing the
papers for the years 19l6-I9 7,
1917-1918, and 1919-1920, and this
file is supposed to be a complete
record of college activity for those

We say, “is supposed to
It would be except for the
fact that some unscrupulous person
took it upon himself to remove
Volume ll front the office without
permission, and returned the same
in a badly delapidated condition
:and without the copy for October
17, 1917.

Now those 'bound copies of the
“ News " are the only written iis—
tory of State College, They should
be guarded as jealously by the
student body as the old Domesday
Book is guarded by Britain. Any-
one should consider it a disgrace
to in anyway tamper with or de-
spoil these records. Hitherto we
have left these books open to stu-
dents, as many occasions have
arisen when they were the only an—
thorities to which one could refer
to settle certain difﬁculties. We
trust that the- students will cor
operate with us in this matter, so
that we will not have to put the
ﬁle under lock and key.

Remember this. State College
people. Respect the "News" ﬁle.
Guard it carefully for it is one of
your most treasured possessions.
And, if you have a, copy of'thc
“News” for October 17, l917,
bring it to the Publication’s ofﬁce
so that we. can .completesVohime II

- .thn ’ybu hear 'a State. College
orchestra.- mentioned, pr ' see" a
notice of oréhestrajpracuce, do‘you
eder think of a group"of girls, each

 

with it stringed instrument, antimi-
by it lake playing and singing
song's , old and new, under it won—
derful "harvest" moon?
you do not. You would be apt to
think of'it, tlio', if you had joliied
the orchestra ii few Weeks ago.
You can have a part in such lacks
and better ones if you join the
orchestra now. v

Think of iit—a college the size
of State with six nienrbersi Win-re
is our college spirit? livery one
who plays any instrument shows
his lack of that spirit every time
he does not come to orchestra prac-
tice Wednesday nights, Will there
be an orchestra we can justly be
|)l’tlll(l of this year? it depends on
us; on you—yes——on you, with
that mandolin, violin or guitar at
home. Your alum malcr calls you.
Aren't you coming?

WANTED!

Well, what’s wanted nowi‘ List
and you shall bear. We want
more, and lots more at that, "gin-
ger and snap " in upholding our
college traditions. livery real col-
lege has traditions. State is cur-
lniiily it real college, and we have
traditions, and we want in make
these same traditions “ really real "
by upholding them with all our
might and main. Now, freshmen.
the Clarion call is to you who are
not as yet fully acquainted with the
customs of tlic alum mater. Even
willi all the excitement of mid-
semestcr tests, rcmcin‘bcr this one
thing: On Friday morning you
must remain seated in assembly un~
til all the other classes have passed
out of the auditorium. it may
seem irksome and exasperatiiig :it
ﬁrst, but just remember that it is a
duty which you owe to our college.
Just remember that every freshman
who does this is both “class-otic”
and “college-mic.” Just rcmcin»
‘her that lasting traditions must be
upheld by each entering class. ’23

The club was started last spring
and has progressed rapidly. The
members are all nonifratcruity men

ciety represented in the interim-
ternity council.

The situation at liensselaer has
been a peculiar one. There are
only twelve recognized fraternities
in the school and the percentage of
students who are illulillilt‘i'ri is about
thirty. The neutrals, as the iiou~
fraternity men are called, have not
shared in l'llu social life and student
activities as fraternity men have
and one of the principal reasons
for the organization of the Com»

give the iionfriiteruity man a
chime lfrom lime to time, during
the history of the institute, the
neutrals organized on purely politi-
cal biisis and, although successful
for n time, such organizations
lacked the ideals and qualities nec-
essary for permanence and on los-

graduation or loss of interest dis-
solved.

made for recording what each class

going to e a thermometer like
affair on the bulletin board, with
class colors for mercury, which will
indicate the progress of each class

Then the sing began. After a
little scnior-soph versus junior-
frosh competitive singing of the
alma mater, Miss Underwood
taught us ” Swance " and " Bye-lo."
The sing was closet] by "Hail,
Professors.”
