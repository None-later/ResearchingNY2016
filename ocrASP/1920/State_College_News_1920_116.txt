ANNIE WHITE
STRATHEM

Teacher and Social Worker for 55
Years-Former Normal School
Graduate

Miss Annie White Strathcm, 73,
years old, died-on Thursday even-
ing, October 21, 1920, after a linger»
ing illness. Miss Strathem was
born in,France and she received,
hpr education at 'the.Albany State,
borrhal School. from which‘ she
graduated in 1870. .

he was a pioneer worker of the
Children's Aid Society, beginning

\

 

her career as a teacher in the So-
ciety in lliﬁfi, and she served faith-
fully for 45 years. After serving
as a tear-her in t -' (lertnan school
in blast Second Street. New York
City, she was appointed principal of
the Henrietta School in East
’I‘wenty-lirst Street, and when the
building was taken over by the
loard of Education for a 'l'ruttut
School, she was -appointed us Sell
Ilenlent Worker on East Sixteenth
Street. .‘x'ot content with the daily
routine of duty, she I't'tlt‘lled out
for further opportunities of service,
which she soon found in evening
work among the young people of
the ueighlmrhood. in her early
tee s site even gave up her Sunday
evenings to work with the boys in
the lodging ltutlses. During her
summer vacations, she spent her
time with “her children " as she
liked to call all her pupils at the
liresh Air llrauches, ’l‘hirty years
or more ago Miss Stratheul started
what was probably the first Work-
ing (iirls' Vacation Home, through
furnishing and equipping a farin-
house at lladlyme, Connecticut,
where her young people and their
friends could pass the brief vacation
days.

In 1908 she organized the Moth-
ers' lleipers Association, where she
trained "little mothers” in the art
of houseke ' ging. In the afternoons
she had clubs for the younger boys
and girls still attending school, and
in the evenings for the Working
men and women. For litany years
she felt the need of a work of this
chart "lct'; since then other organi-
z: ions have follower] her example.

livury Shrove ’l'uesday, a reunion
was held of Miss Strat'hem’s for-
mer pupils whom she held together
through her happy, enthusiastic
leadership while man were en-
couraged and personally aided to
fit themselves for real leadership.

n this occa.‘.iou the pupils sang
old songs. talked over old times,
drank coffee and ate doughnuts,
and always ended up the evening
with “Autd Lang Sync." Those who
were unable to come wrote letters.
Not only did boys and girls of years
ago come. but they brought their
children and gramlchildren. Plans
were under way to celebrate the
Fiftieth Reunion next year.

All those who came in Contact
with Miss Strathcm will suffer an
irreparable loss in her death. For
55 years she has radiated her in-
fluence to thousands of boys and
girls. She was a noble character.
possessing a sweet. kind disposi-
tion, always Sacrificing herself for
the benefit of others. She was a
power ill the neighborhood which
will be hard to replace.

The blessings of all her boys and
girls follow this noble Women. it
is ho ed that all her former pupils
and riends will continue the work
thereby establishing a memorial so
that the memory of her love and
labor may be perpetuated.
