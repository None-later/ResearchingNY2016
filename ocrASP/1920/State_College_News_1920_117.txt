Illustrating I Deﬁnition

in proving a match to the [now
heating lawyer the Woman Witness
is mohaiin in the inajoritv. At'a
recent case in court a woman wrt-
nch was giviu, very damaging cVI-
dencc against tIe prisoner, and the
attorney for the defense, nettied at
her manner, decided to embarrass
her if he could.

“ in giving your testimony, ma—
dam, i observe that you are con.
stantly using the word 'irony,‘
May i ask if you comprehended
its true meaning?"

” Well. i think i do. l will iilus:
irate. if i were to call you a gen-
llcmau i should unquestionably be
indulging in most decided irony.”

 

Big Hats and Old Age

In opening the services one Sun-
day recently, the pastor of one of
the fashionable churches Said:
"For three Sundays .l have asked
the women in this church to re-
move their hats during service.
My appeal has hcen nnhccdcd, and
now i 500 wherein I was wrong.
was inconsiderate of the comforts
of Ihe aged and inﬁrm, so I have
made :I new rule. Hereafter all
women of forty years of age or
over will in: permitted to wear their
hals during,r the service,"

Wilhiu twenty seconds every wo-
man in the church was bareheaded.

Life in a Flat
“ Hello, ’I‘om, old man, got your
new flat litth up yet ”
" Not quite,” answered the friend.
"Say. do you know where I can
buy a folding,r toothbrush P"

 

 

Tommy's Inspiration

They were at dinner and
daintics were on the table.

" Will you take tart or pudding?"
asked Papa of Tommy.

“Tart,” said Tommy promptly.

His father sighed as he recalled
the many lessons on manners he
had given thc 'lmy.

" Tart, what?" he queried kindly.

lint Tommy’s eyes were glued on
the, pastry.

"Tart. what?” asked the father
again, sharply this time.

" Tar first,” answered Tommy
triumphantly.

It Was Hopeless

" Be careful," said the foreman of
the construction gang to a green
hand who had just been put on tile
Joli, "keep your eyes open. When
you see a train coming, throw down
your tools and jump off the tracks.
Run like blazes! "

“ Sure!" said Thomas, and began
to swing the pic .

In a view minutes the express
came whirling along. Thomas
throw down his pick and started
up the track ahead of the train as
fast as he could. The train ovcr~
took him and tossed him into a
ditch. Badly shaken up, he was
taken to the hospital, where the
foreman visited him.

“ You blithcring idiot!" said the
foreman. " Didn't I tell you to take
care and get out of the way? Why
giﬁn't you run up the side of the

l . '

“Up the Soidc of the hill, is it,
sor?” said Thomas through his
bandages on his face. 3‘ Up the
soide of the hill?
I cannot hate it on the level, let
alone running‘ up‘hlll!”

 

Pullman porter (to aged man as
train #11115 into a depot)—“ Brush
you 0 . sir?" '

Aged man—" No, 1'" get off the
usual way.”
