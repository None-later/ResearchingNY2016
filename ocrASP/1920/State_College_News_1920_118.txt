NEW LOCATION FOR
HOCKEY RINK

Class Teams to Be Formed

The time is fast approaching
when preimrations for our winter
sports will be under way. The
hockey and skating rink will be
located in a most convenient place
on the campus, near the boiler
house and Washington avenue.
Preparation for men's and girls'
class teams has started. This year
great interest was shown in liech
hockey on the campus and it is ex-
pected that this same enthusiasm
will be extended to ice hockey. The
individual classes voted to support
hockey this year rather than to
have a college appropriation. ft is
not expected that State College will
have a varsity hockey team this
year since the desired appropriation
was not given by the student body.

ing" as a means of expressing this
loyalty.

Dr. Brtlbacher impressed upon us
the fact that in college, of all places,
appears loyalty, for the cultivation

portunity should be seized.

The following points were given
explaining our opportunities to ex—
press our loyalty. We should be
loyal to our college because it is
“ours.” We should have pride in
Everything in college and throw all
into the maintenance of college
tradition. The fact that we have
