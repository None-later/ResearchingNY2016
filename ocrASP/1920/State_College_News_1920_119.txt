WHY NOT?

Although student assembly is
held in the auditorium and not; in
the library, a great many students
seem to be under the impression
that the 11:35 period is designated
as a general study hour. Why can—
not this time be given freely and
whole-heartedly to student inter-
ests other than Study? Is not that
the reason for student assembly?

Vc realize that some people will
say that many of the things dis-
cussed there arc of no interest to
them, so they feel they must apply
themselves elsewhere. If one :1 us

tcrcsts are those of every student-w

Again, a student may say this

SAVE TIME —'— AND SMILE

-/\t State College we ﬁnd fault a
great deal with the amount of
study that is required of us. Some
people are always scolding and
talking about all the work they
have. to do.- It oes seem to be a
[State College tradition that the
faculty shall do all in their powor
to prevent time from hanging. on
our hands. Scold all you like about I

and breath for doing it.

them. Keep smi ing and be cheer-

you need to do is to maintain your
happy dispositions and don't waste
time. Worrying about things only
injures your physical' and mental
health and that of all your friends.
If you are cheery and sweet-tem-

in half the time. As to wasting
time, that is the easiest thingr in
the world. You hang around the
balls a couple of hours. 'ou go
home and sit around for an hour
before dinner, and then an hour
after dinner. These hours add up.

THE MUSIC CLUB

How many of you if asked if you
belong to the Music club could look
your questioner straight in the eye
and tell him “Yes ”? Or are you
one of those who. would start
slivering up the corridor floor and
chase around wildly through your
brain for an original excuse that
would run something like this:
"Well, no-o-o, but I've been gmng
to join for ever so long" (you
might think the club had been
founded a hundred years ago);
"but you see I just haven't had the
time'and I'm so busy with ' (prac-
tice. teaching if you’re a senior;
juniors, fall back on your commit-
tees, thosc dreadful sophomore pro-
gramswthey’ll know better next
year, and the poor swamped troshl.

h, well, just the same old tale.

But that isn't it. Busy or not
busy, practice teaching or only the
anticipation of practice teaching,
the Music club needs your support,
and the Music club deserves your
support. The (bias won't "break"
you, that’s certain, and you'll surely
have an hour of genuine pleasure
if you attend the iii-weekly meet—
ings.

Yon complain that State College
needs more clubs——wel|, here‘s
your chance to support one that she
has. it is more than just a Music
club. too, you know. if you care
for literature, it you are interested
in the cultural, join the Music. clu‘b.
ntlc’nd its meetings, help it “carry
on.‘

The more we think about it the
more we are convinced of its truth.
