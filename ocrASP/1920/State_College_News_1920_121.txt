STUDENT ASSEMBLY

Continued from Page i.
the rare opportunity of being one
of a chosen group to do the big
things in life should thrill every
student, Loyalty to our friends
will leave lasting memories in
years to come. Mistaken loyalty
was explained as the lowest sort of
loyalty and we were warned against
subscribing to it.

Princeton was mentioned as an
example of a college which showed
the ﬁnest loyal spirit. They ex—
pressed this spirit in singing as was
suggested to it. The einolinn with
which a group of Princeton
students sing their college songs in
the midst of (lClI'IIl in a game. can»
not do anything but arouse a simi—
lar emotional feeling among other
spectators. If we, like them, could
singr when we are failing, our spirit
would he one of which to he proud.
We tried to realize the weight of
the feeling cxhihited by an immense
Princeton group, when they sang,
hy trying one of their songs,
” Ilurrah for Old Nassau.”

SWIMMING PARTY

 

For the second time this year. a
group of students met to accom-
pany Miss Fay to the swimmin‘
pool, last Friday afternoon. There
will be chance for only one more
“duck” before Thanksgiving.
Come ahead, sign up on the
“Co-op" bulletin board, and join
with us to-morrow.
