DR. JOHN H. FINLEY
RESIGNS President Wilson Proclalms Thanksgivmg

Dr. John H. liinley, Slate Com-
missioner of Education and l‘resi-
(lent of the University of the State
of New York, resigned his position
November 18, " to enter an impor-
tant advisory and editorial relation
with the New York ‘Times.’ " His
resignation will not take effect
until January 1, or as soon after
that as his successor is named.
This will be done at the meeting
of the Board of Regents in Dc~
cem‘bcr.

Dr. liinley's reasons for resign—
ing were that he was anxious to
enter the profession for which he
was especially prepared at Knox
College, and that he thought he
could ill: of service to his own
generation in having a part in solv-
ing the problems oi to-day. lie
believes that the press has a good
opportunity to help the cause of
education.

Dr. liinlcy, who was president
of the College of the City of New
York, before becoming education
Commissioner in 1913, is widely
recognized as an authority on edu—
cation. His work has received ofti-
cial recognition from three foreign
countries, France, ltaly, and Japan.
Ills work in the World \thr was
extensive, especially in Red Cross
work in Palestine.

Dr. Finley is titty-seven years of
age, and is a native of lllinois. lie
was graduated from Knox College
in 1887. He has received honorary
degrees from many American uni-
versities and colleges, including
Johns llopkins, University of Wis—
consin, Princeton, Williams, Darte
mouth, Columbia, Brown, Colgate,
and New York nivcrsily. He
was president of Knox College
from 1892 to 1899. He was a mem—
ber of the Princeton faculty for
three years, and in 1903 he was
elected president of the College of
the City of New York.

Dr. Finley says that. while the
seven years that he has held this
ofﬁce. have not been very prosper—
ons years in the world's Ihistory,
nevertheless, they have been‘years
of progress in the educational
world. Better schools and better
school facilities have been insti-
tuted for the children of the State,
both rural and urban. Higher edu-
cation in universities and colleges
has been encouraged, and the pro»
iession of teaching has been raised
to a far higher level than before.

Dr. Finley will be remembered by
many college students as being a
most interesting speaker. He has
spoken at college at different times,
one time being at the celebration of
the 75th anniversary of the ionnd~
ing of State College. He has many
personal experiences which are
very fascinating and his sense of
humor is strong enough to hold any
audience.

Dr. Finley says that he has de-
clined many good positions none of
which seemed comparable to that
of the educational field. But he
feels that the new ﬁeld that he is
entering oﬁ'ers as good opportuni—
ties for service as the one he is
leaving.

BASKETBALL PRACTICE
STARTS

With one week of practice he—
hind us the outlook for basketball
is encouraging.

The prospects for a winning team
at State College this season are
fair. The practice the past week
was hindered by the, absence of
Captain H athorn and the temporary
disability of T. Cassavant and
Baker. The absence oi these men
from one or more practices gave
the coach an opportunity to see
how his second string men would
work if they were needed. The
work of the whole squad showed
need of serious study and hard
work. The passing and shooting
were woefully erratic and wild.
There was a decided tendency to
dribble needlessly which always
breaks up teamwork. These faults
are im outgrowth of the interclass
games and should be speedily cor-
rected. The most promising fea-
ture of the whole practice was the
realization 'by the men of their
shortcomings, and the spirit mani-
fested in their' efforts to correct
them.

There is not a wealth of material
by any means and more men are
needed. v

asked to gather at one end of the
room and the sophomores at the
other end facing the seniors.
While they were arranged in this

program was a solo by Charles

ray, Miss Phillips, Miss Martinez,

As the crowd was about to leave

brave attempt to get the sopho—
morc_ banner. The sophomores
were too much for them, however,.
and saved it, alter having had a
very narrow escape from losing it.
