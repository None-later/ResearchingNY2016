THANKSGIVING

To all its readers the “ News "
extends good wishes for a happy
Thanksgiving.

Just three hundred years ago the
Pilgrims set aside a day in order
to return thanks to God for their
safe arrival in America. Since that
ﬁrst Thanksgiving that little band
of Pilgrims has grown into
colonies and the colonies into a
mighty and prosperous nation.
There is much more to be thaan
ful for now than there was then,
but that first Thanksgiving with
its simplicity and sincerity was the
only true 'l'hanksgiving that Amor-
ica has celebrated. As the years
have passed by, the last Thursday
in ,Noveml er has been set aside as
a day for jollity and festivity.
People have come to look upon
Thanksgiving as a day to pay
homage to Mr. Turkey.

Now we do not think that this
is so far from the purpose of the
(lay. ,We can sometimes best ex-
press our thanks by being happy.
But still it would be more like the
'true spirit of the day to save a
few minutes for serious contempla-
tion of the things for which we
should be thankful. And in that
time we should try to think how
we can best become useful citizens.
for that is probably the greatest
way to thank God for his blessings.

LET’S BEAT YALE AND
HARVARD

In Chancellors' Hall on Tuesday
evening, February 8, John Drink-
water is to lecture on “An English
Dramatist's View of Lincoln."

his English dramatist has been
presented at both Yale and l-lar-
vard. Now, come. students ‘of
State College. let us heat those
colleges in the turn-out we give Mr.
Drinkwatcr. Let every student be
present! ' ‘

,In the first Place, this poet is of
interest to us as the author of the
play. "Abraham Lincoln," which
was presented under. his vsupervi-
sion in both New York and London
with the greatest success.

 

In the second place. letfs come
to hear this lecture for historical
and patriotic reasons“ It is said
that ,Mr. Drinkwuter ives ‘fa
heart-gripping picture 0 the dis-
tinctive personality and sublime
leadership of the great president."
' e New York “ Evening Tele-
grnm'ﬂstatcd that this essayist
alone “ has a big enough heart to
measure the signiﬁcance of :1 Lin-
coin for the world." r

But, for all our interest in liter-
ature, history, ‘ and dramaties,
fascination for this man rests upon
his powernt personality. A per-
sonality great enough to attract
even his critics.

So. on February 8, let us, State
College students. I‘ill to overﬂow-
ing the balcony of Chuncellors'
Hall. We would like to offer the
famous advertisement, “if not
satisfied. every penny will be re-
funded " but students are admitted
free of charge.

SIGN UP FOR RED CROSS

Present reports indicate that 1921
Red Cross membership at State Col-
lege is failingsr behind that of 1920.
ll looks as if the student body will
have to wake up and support the
drive if they wish to retain their
reputation. The response of the
family deserves connncndalirui. and,
without a doubt. thcir subscriptions
will reach 100%. The freshmen
seem to bc a bit disinterested and as
yet are “bringing tip the rear."

that this is (Jllt! of the omiortunilics

the other classes. there seems to be
some diiliculty: perhaps it's only a
misundcrstaiulinu. because many
have had their subscriptions credited

BILLETS DOUX

’l‘hc billet doux habit is common to
all walks of college life. We do not
mean that these beloved notices are
necessary adjuncts to ouc's career.
but that they are accidents that have
their place—an important one, at
that. When one goes to college he
wants to experience all the thrills it
can excite. Here is one of them.

These thrills vnrv in quality. for
each victim reacts differently. There
is the fatalist who feels he never
did know anything,r and never will—-
so what’s the use? This type is rare.
for most of us have a snrt of idea
we are brilliant—in somethinu, even
if it be something other than S, C, T.
work. Again. we have the careless
Bean Brununels~they may be girls,
too—to whom study is a side issue
and billet doux part of the day’s
work. This sort of stude is rare at
State, also. Now, the third type
is the serious student who feels as
he gazes mournfully at his billet
doux that he shall just have to stop
grainy.v places——-even on Friday night
——and not to work instead. Here’s
trouble. The type of person—un-
like the ﬁrst two varieties—did not
really deserve a billet doux. Getting
one means he cramps his activities
and “bones” all the time. This
happens, if it happens at all, in the
freshman year.

So. to whom it may concern:
Don’t welcome your billet doux like
you would the crack of doom. it is

Everybody will have the proper

whole instead of in little packages.
Only two weeks remains, so that

WAR ORPHANS
l wonder how many in collch

have ever heard about our support“
in}: l\th litllc French orphans. f'vr—
ltaps you were not llt'rt‘ two years
auo when through thr French Club
the collect: adopted these children.
if perchnnct‘ you who were here do
not remember, may l recall the facts
to vour minds.

The occasion of our takimr these
T’rrnch children was the deplorable
conditions imposed by the war upon
the French people. many of whom
were left destitute of homes. and
what we consider essential to life.
such as food and clothing. At this
time the two orphans that State
College adopted wore victims of
these conditions. Mario Jacob, aL'ed
ii. and Francois l‘olh‘l. also need
ll, returned to the devastated rcuiovis
to live in temporan homes built by
the Americans. The college sent
supplies to them and these were
orutcfnlly received. Little Mario and
Jacob both come from larrre families.

Recently word has been received
that they still need help. Are they
WolllL’ to stiffer because Stale Colic.er
is not livingr up to her promise? lt's
up to vou. are we L'Olil‘?‘ to continue
this noble service? When vou re—
call the millions of children in
l'inrnpc now actuallv at war aoaiust
death. do you not feel it your dntv
to help them out of the strnvolc?
if each one when he came back from
his ’l‘hanksnivinLr vacation would
brine somethiae. however small. to
(rive. just think how much we would
have to make two "ruith orphans'
hearts hannv. Miss Pierre or Elisa
Priwouard will gladly recoive any con-
tributions.

RULES FOR STUDYING
EFFECTIVELY

 

The editors think it advisable at
this thin- of the year, when there
are so many outside attractions. to
give to lilt' students a plan whereby
they can economize their study
time. The following rules which
appeared in the Rutgers “'I‘nrgnm"
wcrc clipped from a copy of the
“ Hamilton Life."

The rules wrrc taken from "Edu-
cational Psychology" by Dr.
Daniel Starch. who quoted from
(i. .\l. \'\’hipplc's “ How to Study
Eh’t-ctivcly.” 4

The rules follow:

1. Keep yourself in a good phys-
ical condition.

2, Attend to. remove or treat
physical defects that often handi-
cap mental activity, such as defec<
tlvc hearing, defective icctli, ade-
noids. obstructed nasal breathing.

3. See that external conditions of
work (light. temperature, humidity,
clothing, chair, desk, etc.), are
favorable to study.

4. Form a place-studying habit.

5. Form a time study habit.

6. When possible, prepare the
advance assignment in a given
subject directly after the day's
recitation in it.

7. Begin work promptly.

‘8. Take on the attitude of atten-

tron.

9. Work intenser when you
work. Concentrate.

it). But, don't let intense applica-

Itioln become flustcr or worry.

V 0 your work with the in-

tent to learn and to remember.
Seek a motive or, better, sev-

eral motives.

13. Get rid of the idea that you
are working for the teacher.

14. Don’t apply for help until
you have to.

.15. Have a clear notion of the

lti. Before beginning the advance
work‘, review rapidly the previous
lesson. ‘
