“I see V th' paper," says Dilly
O’Dodley, “ thot a conductor Ib' th’
name 0' John Cows has married a
girrnl b' th’ name 0’ Mary Waters.
Mebhe they intiud ter start a milk
wagon.”

 

Angry Man: " time, what do you
mean sending me this bill for ten
dollars? Didn't you say that I had

no case against the railroad com-‘

tinny?" . .
awyer: " My dear sir, that is
what the bill is for—advice.”

 

-Old Way Would Do
An Obliging Conductor
"Miss," said the conductor, 59-
verely, "if you are going by this

‘train you must get aboard at once.”

it," gasped the dear young
thing, who had been chatting with
another damsel ever since the train
arrived, "do let me have a minute
more: I must kiss my sister."
“Get aboard, miss; gct aboardl”
said the conductor, obligingly, " I'll
attend to that for you.”

A Rise Out of Him
Jones—You’re just like a baker,
Smith.
Smith—How's that?
Jones——Always loafing.

The Little Dears
Edith—’Dcar, Jack is so forgetful.
‘Maud—Isn’t hel At the‘pnrty

last night I had to keep reminding
him that it’s you he’s engaged to
and not me.

 

He saw her stepping from the car.
And up to her he spe .

" May I help you to a—light?"
“I do not smoke,” she said.

. This Is Why
Curious—Why is a ship always
spoken of as she?
Anxious—Give it up. Why?
Curious—Because it takes a man
to manage her.

 

Some Cow l
A Long Island animal was ad-
vertised for sale by her owner:
" For Sale, Cow that gives ﬁve
oiiarts of milk a day also two grind-
stones, one set of harness and a hay
rake.”

Between Stations

The conductor was walking
through the coach when a nervous
old lady tapped him on the arm.
"Please, sir,” she said, “ do you
think this car is safe? A little while
ago I thought the wheels acted
bumpy."

"The car is perfectly safe, ma-
dam,” assured the conductor. ” The
little hump you felt was caused by
the car passing over a frog."

“ Oh,‘ the poor little thingl" she
exclaimed, ” What a shame!"

 

Engineer McGinty says:
It's aisy enough ter be happy
When ﬂoatin’ down th’ stream.
But th' man with while,
Is th' man with a smile,
Whin he can't git up th’ steam.

I Can't
“I Can’t” lacks in nerve, he's too
faint of heart,
To pitch in like a man and do his

’part. I '
Hes none'of the spirit that lights

and Wins;
He admits he’s beaten before he be—
gins.

I Will
“I Will " has a punch hid in either
Ianc,

He has training, strength and a
heap of sand.
I'Ic swings his hard ﬁsts in the
world's grim face;
And bangs away till the world
gives a place.

The Professor had just ﬁnished
an evening talking on Sir Walter
Scott and his works, when a lady
said: "Ohl Professor, I have so
enjoyed your talk. Scott is a great
favorite of mine." "Indeed," said
the Professor, " What one of his
books do you like best?" “Oh,”
answered the lady, "I haven't
read any of his books, but I am so
fond of his Emulsion—I've used a
lot of that.”

Tight Wads

A young clergyman was com—
plaining to a friend that his con-
gregation was made up of “tight
wads.”

"They are so stingy," he said,
” that when I ask them to sing
'Old Hundrcd’——they sing ‘The
Ninety and Nine ’."

“Who was this ’ere Nero, Bill? "
asked a costar of his friend as they
gazed into the picture shop.
“Wasn’t 'e the chap that was al-

' No, that was Zero," was the
answer. "Another bloke alto-
gether."
