FRANCOIS POLLET —
STATE COLLEGE’S
PROTEGE

During the war, State College or-
ganized and maintained an active
Red Cross chapter. A contribution
of $194.58 was made to the college
chapter by individual subscribers
and the following organizations.
late in 1918'. Pcdagoguc lioard,

 

Class of 1918, Dramatics Class,
and Spanish Club. Miss Mildred
Carswell, ’18, who was the chair-
man of this organization, author—
ized, with the approval of other
members, that $73 of this balance
be Sent to “ The Fathcrlcss Chil-
dren of France, Inc.” for the adop-
tion of two orphans, and Miss
Charlotte C, Loeb, head of the
French department, was made the
custodian of the correspondence be-
tween the child.en and the college.
The balance of the iund, $l2l.58,
has just been sent to renew the
subscription.

It is of interest to know that the
orphans are a little boy and girl
each 11 years old. They are Marie
Jacob and Francois Pallet. A small
photograph of our little protege is
shown above. The letters which
have come to us from the children
have shown how much the help
was needed and how deeply the
friendship of the “god—parent " was
appreciated. Below are translated
a few passages from letters re-
ceived which will emphasize the
great need and the spirit of grati-

tudc.

(Se t. 9, l920)——“t have just re-
ceive the check which you were
kind enough to send me and I want
to thank you most sincerely for
your great kindness. We haye just
returned to our devastated city. I
you could but imagine how sad it
all is. There isn‘t a house left. All
has been completely destroyed.
Only wooden barracks stand in

JOHN DRINKWATER To"
LECT

URE

:

Presented by Dramatic and Art
Association

Through the efforts of the Dra—
matics and Arts Council John
Drinkwater is coming to State Col-
lege and Dr. Clarke is to be pre-
sented in student assciirbly on De-
ceniber 3. Dr. Clarke is going to
show us the advantages of the llis~
torical and Art Society from a
student’s viewpoint.

This year the Draniatics and
Arts Council has adopted the old
maxim of “quality versus quantity."
That is, the council of 1920 aims to
concentrate their resources on the
procuring of a few really noted an-
thorities in this ﬁeld of art rather
than to present a larger number of
less influential lecturers.

he faculty members of this
year’s council are as follows: Miss
Futtercr, Miss ’erine, and Miss
Murray. The ollicers of the. coun-
cil of 1920 are: Miss Gladys
Thompson, president; Miss Marion
Hunter, secretary; and Miss Edith
Weathcrwax, treasurer. The other
members of the cotincil are: Miss
Myfawny Williams, Miss Agnes
Smith, and Miss Grace Fox. From
time to time the members of this
council intend to ask various mem-
bers of the student body to co—
0 crate with them. So, let us
aways remember who the mem-
bers of the council are, and let us
determine to give them the assist-
ance of the whole student body, if
the occasion demands it.

Purple and Gold to Oppose Strong Team

 

State opens her basketball season
Saturday, December 4, when the
Varsity meets St. Michael’s on the
Albany High court. From all re-
ports the Vermonters havc a stron r
aggregation of basket tosscrs, anii
this opening game will be well
worth seeing from all standpoints.

Coach Snavely has had the squad
out for some stillc training every
night. l’tistork is better handled,
and the men are not depending so
much on dribbling. These things
make the prospects of victory

bright in spite of the fact that. sev-
er; of the men have missed prac~
tice because of illness, and Baker
wtll belcntirely out of the game for
some time because of an injury to
his knee sustained in an interclass
football game.

The following Saturday the
Purple and Gold will tackle Union
at Schenectady. Plans are under
way now to charter cars so that
State College students can attend
this game in a body.

 

 

LAW SCHOOL PLAYS
ST. MICHAEL’S FRIDAY

Friday evening, December 3, the
Law School quintet will open their
season with St. Michael’s. The
game will be played on the Albany
High court. " Marty" Barry,
ex-’21, who was a star forward on
the State College team for two
years and who is well known in
‘iaskctball circles. is coaching the
Law School live. The team is
composed of men who have won
athletic honor in high school or col-
lege, and a good game is predicted.
0n the following night St. Michael’
will play State College.

 

MUSIC OF THE POLISH
PEOPLE

 

In the auditorium on \Vedncsday
evening, December 1, a concert was
given in connection with the exteri-
sion course treating with “Immi-
grant Backgrounds and Home—
lands " which is under the direction

Dr. De Porte. This concert was
a coordinate with the previous
musical given by the Russian choir
of St. Basil’s Church. However,
this concert dealt exclusively with
the music of the Polish People.
The cooperation of the “Echo”
Polish Choral Society of Schenec-
tady, which is under the direction
of Stanislaus Kosinski, was secured.
The program included the Polish
national anthem, selections from
the Polish opera "Halka" by
Moniuszko, piano solos, and several

Polish folk songs. The Polish na-‘

tional dance was effective in bring-
ing to our attention the customs of
a foreign country.‘ Such a concert
is not alone of value to students of
mtisic, as it helps the Americaniza~
tion campaign by creating sym-
pathy on the part of Americans for
the ideals of foreign countries.
