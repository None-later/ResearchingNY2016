[STATE COLLEGE AND
ATHLETICS

 

The following article, entitled
"Winnng Grid Team llelps Penn
State," was clipped from the
” Knickerbocker J:’ress ":

" The value of a good coach who
turns out good football teams was
never more plainly to be seen than
in the ease of Penn/State College

and Hugo liczdek. Penn State has

[ad more applications from pro-v
spective students for the term
which begins in September of 1921,
than in any previous year of its
history. And strange to. relate.
Penn State has no organization of
former students to bolster attend-
ance.
“Athletes from all of the leading
high schools oi‘the east have shown
‘a preference for Penn State Col-
lege, and apparently for no other
reason than that Penn State turns
out a first class grid machine
coached by a past master. The en~
trollment for Penn State in Septem-
ber’ of next year promises to be the
'greatest the school ever hail. Does

.winning football pay? ”

In this article a proposition is set
.forth'which is applicable not only
to Penn State and iootbali but to
all colleges and all college sports.
Do college athletics pay? Un—
doubtedly they do, for they are one
of the best possible advertisements.
'Not 'only do they attract athletes,
buttmcn who have never taken a
very active part in sports or, _even
further in the case of co«ed insti-
1utions,'girls like to go to a college
where athletics‘have a prominent
"place. for‘they form the nucleus
about which. college spirit and
loyalty are built up. Penn State.
Harvard, Yale, Princeton, Colgate,
and other institutions realize this
and‘ they all haire their special ways
,for letting the world know about
their activities in this ﬁeld.

.‘ v'Now New 'York . $t‘ate _College
has started a campaign for more
’men next year. Inzconnection With
this campaign an athletic ibulletin
Flies been planned. Ihis‘butletin
( ill be. sent’ to high schools
tthroughout the Stale-in order to

'Idveftisc State College. Would it .

 

not also be wise to take another
step along tliis‘samc line? Why not

ave an athletic press agent? Th 5 »

cotild be prov ed orln much the
same manner as‘the ofﬁce of cheer
leader. The holder of ants ofﬁce or
his assistants would make all trips
with,teanis, and he would be en-
titled to a minor “5.”. His func-
tions would be to co-operate with
the daily papers and the “News” in
publishing all sporting items of in-

terest.

The need for such an ofﬁce can
readily be seen. This year there
was an Interelass Basketball
League. How many of the games
were given to the‘daily papers?
This year also there was a wall
played football match between the
upper classmeu and the lower ciass~
men. as there any mention of
that in the daily papers? Varsity
basketball practice has started, a
captain has been elected, and the

first game comes next. Saturday,

night. What has been done to let
people know about these events?
Colgate, idea, and the am
School have already started to ad-
vertise basketball. Who is to
blame? Certainly the daily papers
are not to blame? They cannot be
expected to publish those things
unless State College takes some
pains to keep them informed in re-
ward in them. The Albany papers
have always had it good deal of
civic pride, and State (Toilette is a
part of Albany. They have always
given space to State College
athletic news. and there is every
reason to think that they will con-
tinue to do so if we co—operae with
them and bring them items of in—
terest.

So the blame clearly resls with
State College,‘ lint still it. is not
possible to pick out any particular
individual and say that he is at
fault. The fact is that there is no
one whom we can hold responsible
for neglcot to advertise Slate 10l-
letre events. if we intend to not
those men next year, it seems as
though one of the firs-t things for
us to do is to remedy this situation,

VATTEND THE UNION
GAME

A week from Saturday Sta-to plays

Union at Schenectady. As ‘has
been the custom in previous years,
special cars will ‘be chartered in
order to take the State College
rootci's over in a body. iiere is a
chance for everyone to show that
he is back of the team. The ex-
pense will not be great, but the
conﬁdence which will be given the
team, if there is a good cheering
section, will help them to win this
game. So everybody Sign up for
this trip.

CHEER PRACTICE HELD

 

Wednesday afternoon 'State Cob
lege students gathered .1“ the Al-

bany High gymnasium ttl order to-

praotice cheers for the St. Michael's
name. At this time also tryouts
for cheer leader and assistant cheer
leaders were held. One ofthe new
features «this year is that girls may
try out for. cheer leader. Enthusn—

‘asm is great among,r the students.

and undonlbtedly one of the fea-
tures of "he ﬁrst Varsitv game will
he the Purple and Gold cheering
section, ‘
