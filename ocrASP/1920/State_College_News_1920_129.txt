While cotnpzn'ative scores and

‘An analysis of the records of the
various college elevens of the
east develops some interesting

 

 

and confusing data. The West
Point cadet team, although de-
teated by the Navy and Notre
Dame, managed to roll up an
aggregate score of. 314 points
which, so far as scoring is con-
sented. gives the Army tirst place
in the section totals. Williams,
wi-lvh lienny lioynton, the star in-
dividttal scorer of the east, is next
‘in line with a total ref (“2 points,
although defeated in three out of
the eight games played. These are
the only com‘hinatious to cross the

nell are third and Howell respect—

From a delensive standpoint,
