Mother Goose — Modernized

Hi diddle, diddie,
The cat and the ﬁddle;

The cow jumped over the moon,
And when she looked back
Where the motor cars track.

She hadn’t jumped 33 too-soon.

A The Fighter

, No man is a failure until he loses
his, ambition. As long as he can
hope and strive for greater things
—,-as long as his eyes are still upon
the goal he set out for, he is poten-
tially a. success.

No than is down as long as there
is tight left in him. It may be a
long Ways back or up but he' is
, never beaten until he cries “quits.”

Come back! ‘Why. no manever

went so low or. failed so uttitly'but‘

hat it was possible for him to
stthhisvway to the very top’ the
co rage” and his ambit ons.

You Can be e Caesar in Your

Caesar was captured, placed in
chains, and put in a boat to be
taken to Rome and thrown into a
dungeon. Before he got there he
talked himself out of his chains,
made himself captain of the boat,
and the crew took him where he
wanted to go. , —— Ex.

Just Before the Fight

The Mack-haired boy had a
mighty contempt for the tow-
headed boy.

“Huh,” he said, "your mother
takes in washing."

" course she does,” the tow-
hended Satirist replied, “you didn‘t
think she would‘leave it out at
night unless your father was in
jail, did you?”

It Said So; and He Did

A‘German took out his ﬁrst nat-
uralization papers. As he was
about to leave the courtroom he
was observed to scan very closely
the official envelope in which had
been inclosed the document that
was to assist in his naturalization.

In a few days he turned up again.
Presenting himself to the clerk of
the court he bestowed upon that
dignitary a broad Teutonic smile.
saying:

"Veil, here I vos.”

" Pleased to see you. I'm sure,"
said the clerk with polite sarcasm,

"Would vou mind adding who you‘

are and why you are here?”

e man seemed surprised. He
exhibitor! his ofﬁcial envelopc.‘ " It
says, ‘Redurn in five days,’ " he ex-
plained, "und here I vosl "

Little Davey was forever askinz

a

 

his tired motherﬁn y told him

a cat. you now."

Davey was so impressed with
this that-he kept silent for three
minutes. Then: “Say, Mother,
what was it the cat wanted to
now?"

“I’m chagrinedﬁ‘ complained the

For I feel so small and futile
And embarrassed— since the
