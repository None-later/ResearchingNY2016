COLLEGE NIGHT A
GREAT SUCCESS

The. evening of December 3
came. and wiili it came “College
.\ighl." that iiiysterions affair
which had been so cleverly adver-
tised for the last few weeks. The
interest of the audience was oh-
tained right “off the hat" ‘hy the
distinctive programs. The loyal
“spunk” and tidelity of State was
illfllﬁt‘tl in the college songs when
. ' Underwood. song leader, and
Miss tall. pianist. led us in sing-
ing the Alma Mater and in vigorous
cheering for tnir “ l’rt ” atttl
Dean. "he representativ seenes
were divided into two groups. lit
the n 1023 Miss llungerfm'd, as
l’rincipal of High School. and Miss
l"irtlant|. as npervisor of l’art
’l‘iine ‘lucatitin. recall the college
activiti of 1920. and in the sec ind
part they .see the interests of our
students in l925.

The Y. W ta’ihles revive that
dormant craving for llershey hars
and incidentally for dimes. 'l‘lie
rush to the mail hox and the honor-
ahle or dishonorahle relr-at recalls
that gnawingr fear on the appear—
(nice of “ llillCts Dons." ’l‘he ‘lias—
kt-thall nirls revive that evu
' s rivalry and those esc

g "el'sv games." 0n the. ap—
pea Inee of the tennis champions.
we can even imagine ourselves at
\\"as|hin:,nton l’ark watching a tennis
tturnanient. The in y skating
party recalls our fiendish tles re for
vero weather and that niatl l h to
the lake when skating is lirst al—
lowetl The hockey team reminds
us that in IQZH State was in. ie-
, lining to awaken in the pos '
ties of llll‘il sport. And then comes
tl'e V. \V. (f r , reception and with
it that uncomfortable feeling that
passed over you when, as a fresh-
man. you shook hands with the re-
et-iviiie line. Mary (‘irnhn speaks
on “ Modern l'hotngrapliy” and it
reminds one, of the. interested start:
of a freshman during the program
and also of posing for the picture
to send “home,” 'l‘l‘e l'ltlllH‘ lico-

all other teas. Some of which are
eninyed and some of which are
endured. We concede that the

eianis. and at this particular tea

minded that at sorority dances we
