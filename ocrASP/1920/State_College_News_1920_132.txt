JUST A WORD OF PRAISE

The "News" does not "make
any bones " about criticising; and,
as We criticise, so we should praisc.
Last week chuc.~day night, when
the varsity staged an exhibition
game and there was chccr prac-
tht', in spite oi the heavy rain and
the lnct that the time cncroachcd
on the dinner hour, State College
students came out to cheer lot
their team Such spiritshould not
go unnoticed. if there is anyone
thing which will make a winning
team, it is the feeling that there is
a strong collcgc spirit behind them.

ii the student-s continue to Show
the same spirit, and attend the
Union prune as they attended both
the praulicc game and the St.
Michael's contest, there is no rea—
son w'hy State College should not
rapture Union‘s scallp next Satur-
.day. ,

WONDERING

For over three years we have
been comng to student assembly
—ttittl wondering. And cvcry Fri-
day our wonderment increases,
~ Last week We sat duringr Dr.
Clarke‘s talk and still wondered.

1 Within a radius ol three yards
were

3 people correcting: papers;

1 person making' an orgaudie
colar;

l person (loin: shorthand;

2 people knitting;

3 people readng the “News:"

1 person reconstructing her
beauty per powder puff. A

We refrain from mrntioning the
number in an-a-pparcutly soul satis—
fying state of coma or what might
have been noticed for a. mere
stretch of the neck.

We wonder if our speakers ever
wonder~what student .assenybly
is. .

if it is a study room—-— why not
have it more convenient? num-
her of desks would assist the prac-
tice teacher, with plenty of paper.
ink and red pencils scattered
around A sI-winrt machine or two
in the shaded light of the stained

 

especially necessary because of the
small percentage of men here, why
not a cutcx set in each song book
rack? A ut-ancel ought easily be
given in the hall hour—and it
surely isn’t any more distracting to
the speaker than Sll'ill‘llllg.

Iii, instead, student. assembly is
simply a nice little recreation
period and social hour, why not
l'cllll'lblSll the chapel with easy
“lt‘h't‘r cha s and ht'cplaces? The
seats al-low little stretching for a
,.nod snooze. And most of all we
nccd rclrcshmcnts for everyone.
Some bring their own now—but
it's rather hard on those who have
already consumed thcn sandwich.
ll they've forgotten their sewing
too or are troubled with insomnia
~thcy have nothing to do but
listen. And that's ttttbcnl':tblc———_
we want everyone to enjoy student
assembly—so. it you have any
more suggetinns just drtnmtstratc
them next Friday.

   

 

 

STUDENT ASSEMBLY

Dr. Clarke Addresses College

Stit‘luly of Albany and director of
the State Museum. Miss l’t-rinc,
who lllll‘OtlllCt'tl_ll‘l(' pnakt-r, told
us of Ur. Clarke's Slit‘ ai interest
in the things oil history and of art
that our college city affords.

tion, is the product of beings—the
result of cxt -rtcnce. Under this
heading, many things may be
called art, I’irst. |)r, Clarke spoke
about our Empire State. wlizsu
dinnily and desire for the. hotter
things is so well lypillcd itl its
seal. 'l hen, he turned to our great
natural resources. our rich min-
cal stones and our lcl’lllc valleys
which constitute, to a great cmtcut,
the wealth of the State. llisltory dc-
pcuds on the soil and the rocks bc-
lmv, The history of our State is
closely knit, also, with that ol the
tgrcal lroquois nation, which had
worked otu such a code of ethics,
government and religion before the
white man came, that it might be
called a civic State, Nature and
art, our speaker said, are claslv
allied. And contact with nature.
which of itself brings interest and
appreciation, is a great aid in the
art of teaching.
