What Is Air?

EFORE 1894 every chemist thought he knew what air is. "A
mechanical mixture of moisture, nitrogen and oxygen, with
traces of hydrogen and carbon dioxide, ” he would explain.

There was so much oxygen and nitrogen in a given sample that he

simply determined the amount of oxygen present and assumed the

rest to be nitrogen.

One great English chemist, Lord Rayleigh, found that the nitro-
gen obtained from the air was never so pure as that obtained from
What was the “impurity”? In
co-operation with another prominent chemist, Sir William Ramsay,
it was discovered in an entirely new gas—“argon. ”
discovery of other rare gases in the atmosphere. The air we breathe
contains about a dozen gases and gaseous compounds.

This study of the air is an example of research in pure science.

Later came the

Rayleigh and Ramsay had no practical end in view—merely the dis-
covery of new facts.

A few years ago the Research Laboratories of the General Electric
Company began to study the destruction of ﬁlaments in exhausted

lamps in order to ascertain how this happened.

scientiﬁc undertaking. It was found that the ﬁlament evaporated

—’noiled away, like so much water.

It was a purely

Pressure will check boiling or evaporation. If the pressure within
a boiler is very high, it will take more heat than ordinarily to boil the
water. Would a gas under pressure prevent ﬁlaments from boiling
away? If so, what gas? It must be a gas that will not combine

chemically with the ﬁlament.

The ﬁlament would burn in oxygen;

hydrogen would conduct the heat away too rapidly. Nitrogen is a

useful gas in this case.
Better still is argon.

It does form a few compounds, however.
It forms no compounds at all.

Thus the modem, efﬁcient, gas-ﬁlled lamp appeared, and so argon,
Which seemed the most useless gas in the world, found a practical
application.

Discover new facts, and their practical application will take care
of itself.

And the discovery of new facts is the primary purpose of the
Research Laboratories of the General Electric Company.

Sometimes years must elapse before the practical application of a
discovery becomes apparent, as in the case of argon; sometimes a
practical application follows from the mere answering of a “ theoret-
ical “question, as in the case of a gas-ﬁlled lamp. But no substantial
progress can be made unless research is conducted for the purpose of
discovering new facts. '
