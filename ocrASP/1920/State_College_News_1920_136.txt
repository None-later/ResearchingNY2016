A VICTORIOUS DEFEAT‘

 

As strange as it may sound,
nevertheless it is paradoxically
true that State won a defeat in
last Saturday's game with Union.
:‘\nd that is not to the disorcdit of
Union either, for the (‘iarnets
played a hard game and won fairly
and squarely. lint the Purple and
Gold quintettc showed a brand of
basketbtll playing which will al-
‘ways the remembered by State Col-
lege and by Union, too. With the
game aparcntly lost in the ﬁrst
half. State came backwith a rush
in the second half. The team rc-
fused to call themselves beaten,
and they pressed their opponents
hard right up to the iiual whistle.
with the result that Union had to
travel at topmost speed in order
to come out on the long end of
the score.

With a team that can give such
an exhibition of wholesome light-
ing spirit, and pure grit, State Col-
lege folk are looking forward with
enthusiasm and conﬁdence to the
remaining games of the season.
There is not a student in the Alma
Matcr'who is ashamed of Satur-
day‘s defeat. Rather, everyone
regards it with pride. Everyone
is looking forward to the big game
of the year, the Colgate game,
with the feeling that he can de-
pend On his team to put up a hard
ﬁght.

HOW “TOULD YOU FEEL?

 

if a week after Christmas you
discovered you had forgotten to
include in your Christmas list one
of your very best and dearest
'friends? And if with the knowl-
edge that to this friend you owed
much more than you could‘cver
repay, there came the realization
that you could never repair this in-
jury—how would you feel? Cha-
grined. perhaps. at ﬁrst. Later—
repeulaut. And finally, after you

had passed through the "helpless
feeling" stage you Would end by
being thorou lin ungr with your
self. lint wliai weak that avail?
Ve‘ril , preventiou's the thing—-
cspcciu iy if there be no cure.

Do we. at State College look
upon our Alma Mater as a friend
whom we love? be we realim our
indebtedness to her who prepares
us for and starts us out upon
Our Journey without making any
demand? i think wctlo. And we're
all agreed that we Wouldn‘t will-
ingly forget her when the spirit
of Christmas is impcliiug us to
show our love for our other
friends.

Well—mow is the acceptable

tim‘: put “(lift for Alma Mater”
on your list. right uuw-and avoid
possibilities of remorse in the
future. .
The kind of gift? Something
personal is always most kindly re-
ceived—Why not You—just you
yourself in some activity that will
help make State College one of the
very tinest?

Just now there. is hardly an or-
ganization that needs you as much
as does the college orchestra. Less
than a year ago it was born of the
allll‘ll oi the Class Hi '21. 'i'o-day
it consists of ill members repre-
senting . student body of over 500.
\‘Vot'ds are lutilc things; but are
those numbers? is it fair to Alma
Mater.

if you have a mandolin, a guitar.
a 'ccllo, a violin, a birujn or some
other instrument at home, won't
you bring it back to State, join
lllu orchestra and make it a tillrist-
mas nll'cring? if you lack the in-
strument but possess the willing-
ness, bring that back and possibly
the Orchestra will b' able to ob-
tniu the other essential. And it
you have neither lllt' instrument
nor the desire to make your ol'fcr~
ihg through the orchestra, don’t
draw a line through “(lift for Alma
.\|alcr;" there are other ways.
Think about them while you are
at home; decide what you ought.
to give and then come back and
give il—«wholchcartedly.

MERRY CHRISTMAS!

 

GAMES A6 SPIRIT

We hear a great deal about lack
of college spirit at State, but that
kind of “spirit” was certainly not
lacking at Union Saturday night.
\Vhat is it. if it's not college spirit,
that will intptrl two or three car-
lttads of people to ride from Al-
buny to Schenectady and not ar—
rive home until Sunday morning,
in order that they might see a
basket ball game? You may say
it was just for want of a good
time that they went. but then good
tithes have been had right in /\l-
bauy.

Stale was very well represented
at the game, anyway, and quite. 2|
lot of noise was made on that side
of the gym. Of course, it didn't
equal the Union cheering, but what
could you expect? We had just as
much of a feeling of loyalty and
support for our team as they did,
even if it didn‘t sound so well.

College spirit was in evidence
not only in the side—lines, but
upon the court as well. Everybody
knows that that istrne—‘that is,
everyone who was at the game,
lint, of course, everyone knows
it Whether he was at this partic»
ular game or not. for he has surely
seen other games, am] it is always
the same.

Let’s continue showing this col-
lege spirit at all of the coming

 

'varsity games!
