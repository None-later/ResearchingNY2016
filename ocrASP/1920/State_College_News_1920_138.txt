in draws. The lirst light was staged
between “Knockout” Flynn and
“K. L‘. (Knock 'cm Cold)" Dobris.
These well-known pugilisls gave
an exhibition of terrific slugging,
and when the final gong sounded
they were clapped lung and loud
by the fans. The second battle had
for its principals two of State's
famous fentherwcigbts, “Zlattliug”
licillcy and “Kid” Netiuer. Reilley
was applauded for his quick foot»
work, He certainly could prance
up to, and away from his opponent
with lightning speed. Ncuner
also got a hand for his rapid-lire
system of punching. Not all of
"Kid‘s" blows found their mark.

but he certainly let them rip.

Professor Risley refereed both
lights. Professors Hastings and
birchenough judged the lirst ,cou-
test, while Professors Saylcs and
Hale decided the second.

With the smoke of battle still
in the air the quartcttc, composed
of T. am Cassavzmt, Reillcy,
and Grubel gave two particularly
appropriate songs, namely “Stars
of a Summer Night” and “He's not
Dead Yet."

The next event was a volley ball
game betwcn a faculty and a stu-
dent team. Birchenough, lioysou,
Brown, Hastings, Kennedy, and
|<isley vollcyed for the faculty,
while Iialdwin, Gray, Hill, Ncuncr,
Osborne, and Strain juggled the
ball for the students. The faculty
put it all over the students. as is
their habit, to the tune of 21 to
ll. Coach Suavcly refereed the
game, and Putnam acted as scorer.

Next on the program was a
wrestling demonstration by Coach
Suavcly and Flynn. Rislcy acted
as referee and Kennedy as timer,
The coach showed how the “Fly-
iug Marc." and "me hold.” the
"body scissors," and other famous
holds are worked.

Reilley then sang a solo, and
following that came a gymnastic
exhibition by Baker, ’1‘. Cassavant,’

Pnlt, and Strain. These four
athletes did some clever work on
the parallel bars and the horse.

The finishing touches were given-
The ﬁrst;

was between Professor Saylesp
Mr; Brown, and Mr. Kennetly.‘
Mr. Kennedy came in first, and‘
Mr. Brown in second, The sec-‘
and was a race between stu-.
dents in three preliminaries and a
ﬁnal heat. The ﬁrst. heat between
Bruce, Himmcl-stein and Zuckcr—
man was won by Bruce. The sec-
ond heatpbetween Link, Barker
and Hakes, wasrwon by Link.‘ The
third heat, between Putnam, Sher-

 

ley‘aud [{hciugold was won by
Sherlcy, The. final heat, between
lll‘llCL‘, l..iuk,and Sherley, was won
by Link. 4 -

A good deal of credit for the
suct‘css of the evening also goes to
Professor Kirtlnnd, for he was the
oflicittl photographer of the get-
together. Professor Kirtland sc-
cured some excellent flashlights of
the events, among which was one
of Coach Suavcly demonstrating
the “body scissors," and another
of H. Pull: in inidair on a hand
vault over the horse. These pic-
tures will have a prominent place
.u the records of college activities.

_ JUNIOR PROM

Owing to the fact that many
students prefer to postpone sign-
ing up for the junior prom until
after the holidays, the time for sign—
ing up has been extended to iu~
ciude the ﬁrst week after the
Christmas vacation. However, as
the approximate number of favors
needed has already been ordered,
the number pnrehasabie then will
be limited. You are advised to sign
up early before the supply is ex-
hausted.

ACID FUMES FOR COLDS

The Chemistry Club was pleased
to bear in its meeting of Friday,
December 3, that acid fumes had
been found beneficial for colds and
tuberculosis. ' hey are used as
remedies in German hospitals and
sanatoriums, and have been found
to render the acid factory workers
immune from these diseases

Some of the other topics re—
ported on were the manufacture
and uses of a smokeless coal; tl
use of asbestos in automobil
keep away poisonous gasc
the important part that Uhe vacuum
plays in the preparation of dried
beef.

Lincoln's Keen Interest

Just after the second Battle of
Bull Run the Boston Chamber of
Commerce decided that President
Lincoln was not prosecuting the
war with enough celerity to coin
serve the interests of business, and
so it appointed a committee to go
to Washington and remonstralc
with him upon his dilatory tactics.
The committee was headed by a
Mr. Pierce, who thus described the
interview:

"We found.” he said, "a man
who looked as if he had lost all the
friends he ever had in the world,
who invited us to take seats and in‘
quircd our business. As I was the
spokesman I opened our case, and
as I proceeded the President’s face
relaxed: by-and-by,-he smiled and
betrayed actual interest, and by the
time I concltitlcdwhc was almost in
abroad grin. After I had finished
he inquired if that was all I had to
say, and on my saying that I
thought it was, he asked if some of
the other gentlemen wouldn't like
to say something. They replied
that they thought I had :fully cov—
ered the ground. And then.” cou-
tinucd Mr. Pierce, " what do you
suppose this solemn man did?
Well. he just moved his chair over
to mine, smoothed his trousers over
his knee, then reached over and
smoothed mine down too, and then,
‘with a queer look, which none of us
will ever forget, is said: ‘Mr,

r‘l’icrce, did you ever notice what a

difference there is in lcgs?’ What
did we do? We grabbed our ham

"and took the ﬁrst train for Bos-

ton—and we nevcrdared to re-

portl "
