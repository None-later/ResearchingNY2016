much better game during this half

the playing of State. Besides the
playing of Springmaun and Cassa-
vant the playing of Lobdell against

the game. llrandhurst played a

matched, and Iully ten minutes
elapsed before there was any scor<
ing. The lirst goal was made by
I'Vadswurth of Union. Several
times during the tirst half, through
the good passwork of Cassarant
and Kaag, Stale carried the puck
down the length of the rink, but
was unable to cage it. Union made
three more goals in the tirst halt.
The continual snow handicapped
both teams in playing their best.
The second half opened with a
very close defense game on the
part of State and held Union down
to two goals. State outplayed
Union in the second half in team

work, but was unable to score.

"Inst what's It got. that strap
around its waist for?”

“Oh. that?” answered the instruc-
tor. “ Well, you see, cavalry horses
have :1 distinct sense of humor.
They like to laugh, and sometimes.
when there are recruits around, we
have to put on those straps to keep
'em from bustin' their sides.”

visitor came through.

“My dear boy." said the lady,
“your neck is in a dreadful con—
dition. isn't it? ”

“ Yes. ma’am; all raw,”

"Dear. dear," she said, “it is
simply dreadiul. isn't it?”

"Yes. ma'mn.” replied the boy.
“That’s why they call us rough
necks, you know."

“ Is it now?" solicitionsly asked
the lady. “And how. pray. (lid
your neck get him such a terrible
condition. "

“ Why, it was caused by wearing
a sweater that was knitted by an
American lady. ma'am." -
