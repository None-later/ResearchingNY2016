OUR ALMA MATER

if you were at the home game
with Colgate and necessarily no—
ticetl the way we don’t know the
new tune of our Alma Mater, come
to the publication office and get an-
other copy of the music and take it
home and learn it.

' you weren‘t there you cer-
tainly have heard how our voices
didn’t follow the stmg-leadcrs' tli-
rcctions, and how we had to sit
down feeling, at least, ashamed.
The biggest crowd of the season
out and we tlcnimistratcd‘our lack
of loyalty by not knowing: the tune,
and in many cases not. the words,
of our Alma Mater.

If yru must do so, sacriﬁce learn—
ing: that new " rag" or "jazz ” and
practice State College stings. At
least, become familiar enough with
the tune that so. "stand up " to
recogui'lc it when ll 5 played and to
kuow what to do. and why!

 

A BUSINESS MANAGER

 

What's happened to 192‘. workers
for the “ News"? Last week’s
number shows what the juniors can
do, but in planning for next year's
junior issue we're at a loss to dis-
cover any applicants for the job.
We need especially an applicant for
business manager — see Ellen
Donohnc, 1921. and get busy! We
need workers for other positions,
too. The ” News ” is the represen-
tative publication hch and every
class should maintain its share of
expressed opinion each year by put-
‘ting its best members on the board.

Jug? CRITICISM

in last week's issue of the
" News " we have a criticism of tho
“ Knickerbocker Frcss" in regard to
getting names right in the write‘up
about the Prom.

The criticism was a good one and
well founded. but it did not go quite
far eunuch. erhans everybody has
not noticed that the “Knickerbocker
Press" has not been very profuse
in publishing articles about State

Prom, as last

College and those printed have
shown lack of proper interest.

When our team scored for the
li’rst time, there was no mention of
the game on the sporting page
or any other page. They have
ﬁlled columns with material in writ-
ing tip the defeats and telling how
the opposing teams were far su-
perior and had the game from the
beginning, doing 'just as they
wished with the hall and that their
passwork was much better than
ours. etc, Granted all this, but why
overlook the victories?

The play given by the Dramatics
and Art Association was merely
mentioned and surely it was Worlh
as much space as any production
at the [fall so far this winter.

The junior reception was hur-
ricdly passed over with a number
or erroneous statements. The
week’s “ News "
stated. was very poorly done, This
is one of the events of the college

year, and "the leading.r newspaper

of Albany 'and The Capitol Dis~
trict" gives preference to other
things when it cauld bringr benetit
to Albany in educational as well
as political lines. State College has
grown but how many people in
Albany realize it? How are We go-
lugr to make them my 2e it if we
cannot show them what we are. do-
ing through the only common med-
ium, the newspapers? We must
have all of them back of us.

fnses to have an oliicial correv
spondeut in the college, but pro-
fesses to handle the work from its

all Well and good, why don't they
do it efﬁciently? if a matter is
called to their alteniinn' they make
a bold promise and forget it entirely
or give it hastv attention. We
don’t mean to criticize unjustly, but
we do want fair (reatment, 'Zl.
