COLLEGE NOT TO CLOSE
Continued from page 1

“ News" has attempted to inform
the student body of the condition
of affairs at present.

On the authority of the Dean of
\Vonien we make the foilt’iwiug
stateittents: The number of cases
of ahscnces due to illness is not allv
normal, considering the weather
conditions of the past month. Al'
thouin there are quite a mimhcr of
faculty and students detained at
home. because of colds or light at-
tacks of the grip, there are no cases
serious enough to warrant alarm oti
the part of the student hotly.

 

it is reportd that a certain State
College eirl counted nine moons on
her way home from the Manhattan
game.
