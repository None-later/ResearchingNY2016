been done has already borne fruit,
for many of the younger converts
are becoming ministers. Marion
Moore's topic was Latin-America.
She spoke particularly of the In—
dians there who, it seems, have not
yet found a religion in which they
can express their faith. The Latin-
/\mericans are, however, ditl’ci-eiit
from the heathen, for the former
have philosophical and reasoning
minds, Then, Harriet Holmes
spoke about the Near East. More,
the need of medical missionaries is
felt most, for the condition of the
pepple is deplorable. Alida IIal-
Iagli, Harriet Holmes and Eunice
Nice gave short talks on the mis-
sionary spirit—its usefulness at
home and iii the foreign Iields, its
relation to education. its demands
on the life of a missionary and its
inﬂuence on the Christian mind.
Lastly, Theodore Cassavant gave a
description of the missionary ex-
hibit, He, said that the posters
used there were particularly worthy
of attention. One, for example,
asked if education were to he used
sell'ishly or for all the world. He
quoted, as proof of the value of‘
missions, an authority as saying
one missionary is better than a bat-
talion of soldiers to quell distur«
banees among the natives.

During the afternoon two confer-
eIIec hymns were sung by a quartet.
The meeting was concluded by
benediction, sung by Mary Whish.

SANITARY LOVING

We used to be a jolly bunch,
Real loving little misses;
Now we got a foolish hunch.

And we put a ban on kisses.

It’s all because the Ilu's around.
Along with strepto-cocei;
The little bugs in folks are found
Which' make their heads go
roe 'y,

And'as we go about each day.
We dare not touch each other:

Tlio' love each other as we may
Our kisses we‘do smother.

So. we've become hvtrcnic now.
(int out all mush and driving,

\Ve meet each other with a how——
That's SANITARY LOVING!
