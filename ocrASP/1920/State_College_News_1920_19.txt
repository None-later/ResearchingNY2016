line of the stunt was as follows:
Frances Stilson, as representative
of the Stunt Committee, was tirst
seen endearoring to [ind some plan

lady and gentleman of Colonial
days appeared on the stage. They

.

:\t the last meetng of the As-
sociation of Collegiate Alumni on
Saturday, February 7, Dr, llasi<
ine's was the speaker of the day.
His topic was “lllasco lbanez."
[n his usual scholarly fashion Dr.
Hastings discussed, first of all, the
possible classiﬁcation of Ibanez's
novels as “ prt’rvincial ” or “ cosmo—
politan." He concluded that they
certainly are not strictly provin-
cial in the sense that they deal
with the life of a single districl
without attempting to relate it to
the larger life of the world. To
be sure, lbanez does show us in
detail the life of a single province
and a single class. as when he por-
trays so vividly the peasant class
in " La Bodega.” But he is upt
lacking in the larger outlook which
makes it possible for him to in—
terpret the life of these people in
the light of the world's experience.
Ibancz is, therefore, more truly
cosmopolitan than provincial.

In classifying this author the
speaker discussed two ‘ypes of
mind that we may consider, first
