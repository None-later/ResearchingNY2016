A REPLY

With reference to last week’s
“Just Criticism” we make this
statement: it was undoubtedly
too severe in its criticism of the
attention given' the Dramatics and
Art Association's production. Sew
eral photographs were published
previous to the performance and a
very good write-up followed.

The write-ups of junior week-
end were undeniably poor. This
has been accounted for by the
regular reporter being,r ill on that
date. Profusencss of routine af-
fairs is acknowledged, but we feel
that when things do really happen
here they should be written up as
such. Our first live defeats in
basketball were played ith and not
a word of our first victory incu-
tioned. A very good account of
the Manhattan game followed.

We cannot dictate the policy of
news gathering of any paper ex-
cept our own, but we do feel that

, if regular reporters become ill, as
in the case of the reception, prom
and Pharmacy game, capable sub-
stitutcs should be employed to
cover such affairs. Last year a
student reporter covered our ﬁeld
and satisfaction ensued.

We might suggest to Albany's
newspapers in general that stu-
dents of State College like to be
regarded as such in academic,
social and athletic circles. We are
students in a college, a pedagogical
institution. We are proud of our
profession or we shouldn't be here,
but we are still undergraduates and
would like our immediate environ-
ment to realize this fact. ,

' e don’t mean to criticize un-
justly. but we do want fair treats

WASHINGTON, LINCOLN.
V AND THE'TEACHER

This is the great inspirational

‘month of the year, the month in

which the birthdays of We of our
greatei’it American leaders come. »
It is the time when a great many
students are prone to let their
thoughts wander from the pages of
their textbooks and picture them-
selves in terms of washington and
Lincoln. It is, therefore, lilting al
this time that we should devote a
little space to the appreciation 01
these men.

We have a proud feeling' that
there is not one student who does
not know thelives of Washington
and Lincoln forwards and back"
wards. We do not doubt but there
are many who could tell just why
these men were worthy of honor in
a more pleasing manner than we
can. And so we hesitate about say-
ing more; and yet there is a ines-
sage which these two national
heroes are sending throu 'h the
years to that rroup of war (01's in
which State College is especially
interested. .ln our meager way we
shall try to interpret the bearing of
that message upon the present day
problem of underpaid teachers.

The problem is a vital one. With
the advance in the prices of neces-
sities there has been a decided atl-
vnnt‘e in the wages of everyone ex-
cept the teacher, The result is that
while attractive salaries are being
paid in other lields, the educator
must worry along with a pay enve-
lope barely large enough to keep
him from starvation. What shall
we do? Shall we continue to study
for teachers when aflcr a short ap-
prentieeship we might secure a
much more lucrative position in the
industrial world? in New York
city a great many of the teachers
are resigning, “The Evening ‘uu
for February 13 in an editorial en-
titled “Tbc Teacher Retires." t‘c-
ferring to the retirement of Dr.
Edgar Fahs Smith from his post as
Provost of the University of T'enn-
sylvania. says: “ When the self—for»
getting teacher retires permanently,
the world will shut up shop for
awhile as has happened once or
twice in history."

But what do \Vashingtou and
Lincoln have to say? \Vnsbiugton
gives us an example of supreme
sclf~sacrilicc when he took the posi-
tion of Commnnder-in-Chief of the
American Army without pay, and
helped to linance the Revolution
out of his own pocket at the risk of
becoming ruined. if you would do
something noble (and what is
more noble than combating ignor-
ance?) it can usually be accom-
plished only through self—denial.
This does not mean that the peda—
gogue should necessarily teach
without pay or that he should not
ask for more pay; but simply that.
if he is fitted for his work and
likes it, he should not forsake it
thonin it is not at present very
remunerativc. As for Lincoln, his
message may be summed up by
one quotation, “T‘le sticks through
thick and thin: l admire such a
man." ’21

To the Editor of the News:

With the opening of the second
semester there came a distinct 3
change in the attendance rules and .
regulations. it is not our purpose
to criticize these regulations. but
we feel that they will work an in—
caleulable harm to the college un-
less modified in one particular.

This realization was brought
home to us not a long time ago
when we asked if these regulations
made an exception of athletes eli-
gaeed in carrying on an approved
college schedule of out of town

 

I - . - STATE COLLEGE NEWS, FEBRUARY 22_, 1920

games. We were informed that
this was not the case.

The case then is this: in. a nor-
mal athletic season the team repre-
senting our major sport will make
severalltrips to rival colleges. in
other words the athletic schedule
will deprive these men of their al-
lotted number of cuts. Any ab»
sence thereafter will be excused
only on the presentation of a doc—
tor’s certificate. We feel from our
own experience that there are
cases when a student would like to
absent himself from class under
conditions that would not permit
of a doctor's excuse. Again an un-
excused tardiness would constitute
a cut. In either of the above men~
tioned cases the person would be
considered over-cut and would lose
credit for the particular course In
which he was credited with an ex-
cess number of cuts. .

The risks taken accompanying a
team on a trip are, then, great.
Men are here to secure an educa-
tion; athletics are only incidental.
The problem will resolve itself into
these two alternatives: Either they
must sacrilicc their education or
they must give up their athletics.
In either alternative the college
must suffer. It certainly is not fair
to the men who sacrilicc so much
to put State College on the map.
it is with the hope that these men
may be given some consideration
that we are addressing this letter
to you for publication in the
"News." '20, 'Zl, ’ 3

THE FACULTY TEAS

 

There are teas and teas, as we
all know, but the Saturday after-
noon teas held in the gymnasium,
are more than enjoyable affairs.
There’s dancing for those who feel
so inclined. or card tables for those
who do not. The beauty of these
teas is that they are so delightfully
informal. One does not have to
don one’s best “bib and tucker" to
meet the faculty. in fact the
faculty hostesses want the students
to feel that these affairs are “home-
time" hours. if you have been
skating. shopping or studying, they
want you to drop in for a cup of
tea and a pleasant hour.

MILNE HIGH JUNIORS

GIVE DANCE
A St. Valentine’s dance was

given by the juniors of Milne High
School Saturday night, February 14,
in the, college gymnasium. The
committee in charge was James
McDonough, Virginia Hill, l'lelen
Kirtland, Helen Wurthman, john
Hecox. The patroncssos were
Miss Martinez, Mrs. it. 1-1. Kiri-
land. Mrs. C. j, McDonough, Mrs.
H. E. Hill.

The gymnasium was appropriate“
and cupids and red toy baloons.

ON THE COLGATE TRIP

The team stopped at a hotel
where every room is npcncd by the
same key. it is further reported
that "spooks" paid a visit to this
hotel.

Some people attribute our Cub
gate defeat to a jar of stewed
prunes which was missing when the
game began.

Te Cassavant wants to lie on
both sides of a bed before deciding
which side he intends to sleep on.

Ask hicCal‘ferty what he was
dreaming about. He kept talkng
in his sleep all night.

The basketball management is
greatly indebted to Van Lobdt-ll
and Louis Masson for their great
engineerng feat. They operated a
car between Clinlon and Utica. a
distance of nine miles in three
hours. They are planning to own
and control this line.

lingo Polt is contemplating writ—
ing a book on the “Philosophy of
Femininity.” How he got this
notion at a place whcr girls only
appear in conversation is beyond
US.

What is a trip without a deck of
cards, steam-candy, salted crackers
and breakfast? Ask the team.

 

SENIOR SONG CONTEST

tunity while in college to write a
