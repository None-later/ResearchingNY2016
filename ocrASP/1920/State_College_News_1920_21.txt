Dear Egg:

Yes, Egg, that‘s right. l wasn’t
hintin’ for you to Send me my
ticket, to the l’rom, but o’ course I
suspected you would. You never
could see lhru things in time, .and
anyway that new Betti Kappi tclla
asked me, an' I was there, too.
saw you with that Woolworth girl
and she looked like just what she
was meant ttl—~lO cents, Course,
Egg, i won’t never throw beans at
anybody, but she ain’t nice as I am,
and she don’t never wear a hair

 

net anyway. Girl. iii ’t girls with-
out hair nets, lsggu—ynn ’know
that: not now, at least, cause

there's too much besides their own
hair to hold in, ch? Nice girls!
Why, Egg, l bought five hair nets
just for that From, three to wear
and the other two to catch a man
with—you always catch lish with
nets, y’know, Egg. I ‘

Maybe you don’t think it's expen—
sive for us girls to go to the Prom,
too. Why, Egg, i had to have my
finger nails, shined and then that
wore off so I had 'em done twice
more before I got up there.
guess the shine comes off at the
dinner table. 'kuow I_ always
have my ﬁngers in the pie, so’to
speak. That’s quite a funny paint,
ain’t it, Egg? I didn’t: ge't that
joke about you being apitcher,Egg.
I wouldnt admit I was hollow even
if I was like you. What did Marie
say to you when you told her that
joke? You fellas must have a ﬁne
time at college. All I heard about

from those Betti Kappis was Mary,
Cora, Lingerie, Creix. dc Guerre,
Blanche, Bring the sctssors, Alice,
Come down off that hill,‘ Don‘t
drop that, Si, and such expressions

as them. Now, Egg, do you see
anything to them? Why every-
time 1 said anything somehody'd
say, "Joe, leave the table”-—«‘l Joe,
what’s your excuse?" or "’l‘hein’s
like our pigs.” You up at Union
are goin’ to the dogs. I hope you
keep out of a buucli like that.

i don't know where you got the
idea that you an' me’d get married.
.I kinda had that idea myself.
really am kinda ecouonncal-we
had oysters on~tlic-half~shell for
lnncli today. I didn’t even buy
the whole thing, Egg.

Talk about bein’ a marked man.
I'm beginnin‘ to get cold fct't, I've
had so many zeros. Hope you’re
not too frozen to get that, Egg.
Funny things do happen down
here. Yesterday we was out
walkin’ and we passed a house that
said 745 on the door. I says that's
too early for me, and went right
onl

That was a pretty good tea at
the Gulf Club, Egg, [ didn't see
you there. it was a shame, 'cause
it didn’t CUSl us uothiu'.

l tlio't those two (llsltcs they
gave us were pretty, but I couldn't
find nothin’ on 'em. All of the
sudden | Huh I'd see how the
spoon looked on the other side and
if there wasn't some ice cream un—
der the pattern on the handle. It
was almost melted at that, so I
didn't like to eat it, The tea was
very good tho', ligg, but I don't
believe anybody got any. I heard
there was some in the kitchen—
somebody spilt it. That's kind of
a joke, Egg, lint i don’t s’pose
you‘ll look at it that way. I got a
spoon out a that, tho’ Egg, lni
collecting silver for our hope chest
—-nnt because we can’t buy any
other kind, but just to remind us of
plates we're been.

We went to the batik to get some
money afterward, Egg, so's we
could get some dinner. Gee, that
fella's fresh at your bank, He
says, “how are you gotta get any
dough when he hasn’t none in
here? I says, “you think you
can say anything with that 4%
semi—annual smile of yours.” He
was squelchcd. Cute of me, wasn’t
it? We had some swell dinner,
Egg, bologna, jelly rolls 11’ every-
thing. We was tellin’ about you ’n
'l‘im (that's my lietti Kappi fri'endl
killin’ all the Germans, and Tim
says, "That's not the only dead
language now." l says what else,
He says, “What are you gonna
have?” Funny, eh? Tim’s pretty
lively. Comiu home we took a
car. It was awful crowded with
ruff-necks and so ’l‘im got on first
and told me to pay the fare. He
always tries to protect me. He
says come on, I guess we can
squeeze in here. I says alright
but maybe we’d better wait till we
get out of such a crowd. Gee,
those cars are so crowded, Egg.
It‘s not so bad when I’m with'you,
as they need extra hot air like you
to warm them tip a bit,

Gee, I think the Prom was swell,
didn't you? At ﬁrst, I told Jim I
didn't have no dress, but he says,
“Never mind, lots of them come
like that. I see some dresses cut
too low, some too high, some not
at all and I didn’t go any further."
Over at our house the housekeep-
er’s cat died, so we had a funeral
for it. It was awful sad, Egg.
You should have been there—
you'd have enjoyed cryin', too.
She says, “ The dear little thing,
what will I do without it?" I
says, “Ketch ’em yourself." But
it was pathetic. She says, "The
Bible says if you lose your salt,
what: are you gonna salt with?
What’ll I do without him?" That
spoilt the whole week~end for me.

Our chaperone was swell, but

she said seine kinda peculiar
things, too. She was tcllin' about
walkin‘ out in Jakou's garden
(that big held over by the stone
wall) and a big cow, from the col-
lege dairy .l a’pose come and
scared her awful. Slie tlio’t that
was frightful and I says, " A mouse
run up my skirts oncc.’ She was
mad and says, ” Well, I’d rutlicr

time than a cow." l tlio't that was
kinda a funny thing to say. don't
you. >

you in pencil, but the pigs are usiu'
