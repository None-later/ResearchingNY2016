"SOPHOMORE STUNT” .
Continued from page 1
nor, Frances Recks and Helen

Walsh. ‘

‘ Theneame Lindy and Rastus to
suggest the birthday of Lincoln,
the great emancipator. Catharine
Drury and Isadore Ill-eslau repre;
sent‘ed these colored folks. After
the valentines returned as college
girls, Cupid was very sad, but this
sorrow was soon changed to glad-
ness when she was asked to be
class mascot and was givan a cap
and gown. The stunt ended with
the singing of Alma Mater by
everyone.

.All those who took part are to
be complimented ttpon the clever-
ness and ability which were dis-
played in the dialogues, songs and
dances.

Previous to the stunt voting for
the “ Pcdagogue " took place. Bab
lots were cast for the most popular
faculty and student, the biggest
grind, the laziest faculty and stu-
dent, the nerviest, the most eccen-
tric, and the most conceited stu-
dents.

DR. HASTINGS

Continued from page 1
the conservative who stands pat
{or things as they are, and second,
the radical, the reformer. The
ﬁrst term most certainly does not
apply to Ihancz, the second does.
But again, there are two types of
radicals. One would tear down.
destroy, sweep away abuses, but
he has nothing to suggest with
which to fill the void he creates.
It is to this type that Ibancz ap-
parently belongs. We find no
justification for admitting him to
the higher order of critics, who,
while they still tear clown, yet lay
the plans, at least, for a better,
nobler structure than that which
they destroy.

The charges so often brought to
bear against Ibanez—chargcs of
brutal realism, of lack of reticcncc,
of poor art—theSe Dr. Hastings
treated at length in connection
with his discussion of “The [Four
Horsemen of the Apocalypse." He
spoke of the old Greek tragedies.
which. though noted for their de-
piction of bloodshed and cruelty,
still never allowed scenes of this
kind to actually occur before the
audience, but insisted that they
take place all the stage. Dr. [last-
ings quoted from Hazlitt as an ex-
ample of the accepted standard of
art which holds that there are
some scenes before which "the
veil should be drawn.” Certainly
[bancz offends most seriously any
who hold this opinion and cling to
the doctrine of “ good manners " in

ill" .

In concluding Dr. Hastings dis-
cussed the answcr which Ibancz
gives to the question, "Where so
much has been destroyed by war
what remains to which mankind
may cling?” He finds the author's
answer in the cloaing pages of
“The Four Horsemen,“-——in that
scene among the graves with the
old couple grieving for their dead
son and with their daughter, ignor-
ing their grief, absorbed in
thoughts of her own life and that
of her husband. Loyalty, then,
and the physical instincts,—thcse
things, according to lbancz, are
the ones that endure. --

In keeping with the Spanish at-
mosphere of the meeting a cos-
tume dance was given under the
auspices of the Spanish Club.
Those who took part were: Ellen
Donahue, Florence Bohn, Peggy
Van Ness,.Madeline Cummings,
I'Iarrict Woolse and Alice Brown.
The meeting clhsed with a vocal
solo in Spanish by Florence
Stubbs.
