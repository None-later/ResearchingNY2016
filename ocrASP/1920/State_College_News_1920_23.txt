sailles. the result o! our vote. 261
students and 25 faculty for a com-
promise between the positions of
the Democrats and the Lodge
reservations, compares with that of
the majority of other colleges in
the country, especially those in the
liastern States. :\ few southern
colleges care a plurality to ratili-
cation without any changes what-
soever. while Michigan and some
other colleges and universities of
the Middle West supported the
Lodge program. in almost every
instance the advocates of rejection
were a poor fourth. An interest-
ing phase of the straw vote lies in
the fact that the facility members
of the colleges and universities dis-
tributed the votes in the same
ratio as the students at the same
institutions.

Senators Lodge and Hitchcock
lioth approved of the form of the
questions and ballots. and the
presidents of Columbia, l-lart'ard,
Princeton and Yale acted on the
