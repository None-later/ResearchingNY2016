AN EXPLANATION

The reason for last week’s late-
ness in issuing the “News” was a
delay in getting the copy to the
printer. it left the publication
office on time but the hitch oc-
curred between here and Hamilton
street.

 

THE CUT SYSTEM

For the past week or so a pre-
ponderance of the small talk in-
dulged in during leisure moments
has been upon the attendance rules.
More than half the student body
have already been compelled to use
their precious cuts, due to the
recent weather conditions and ill-
ness. The thought of wasting
such perfectly good excuses seems
distressing to the economical soul.
Then, too, there is the altitude of
the faculty to be considered. How
are they to know whether one is
unavoxdably or intentionally ab-
sent? It is generally understood
that a cloud of discredit hangs over
the intentional absentces. The
tendency now is to use the cuts
immediately so as to take advan-
tage of them. It seems fair that
a student should have the privilege
of a certain number of cuts, but it
has also been suggested that ex-
cusa‘ble absences should not take
up these cuts.

THE LIGHTS

 

Coleman has been provoked to
the point of anger a number of
times lately because the lights in
the locker rooms persist in remain-
ing on for two hours or more
every night. Those who use the
“'libe" evenings have been asked
to switch OR the lights in the lock-
ers when they are through with
them. This is a reasonable re-
quest. Th‘at “we-should-worry-
we-don't—fpay-forJem," attitude is
not commendable. Such a spirit
could not be carried to its logical
conclusion without disaster. t is

A} ATTEMPT

This Week we are attempting a
new venture filling a seemingly
long~felt need. We shall endeavor
to maintain a column in this paper,
similar to flint of large city dailies,
in which delicate, general and per—
sonal questions may ‘be asked, and
upon consultation with authorities
we shall attempt to answer. We
ask that all coinmnnicnfions be ad~
dressed to "Miss Annabelle libel "
and delivered at the publication
office before noon of each .\'luud_ay.

 

The name signifies nothfng~suu~

ply a null] dc plume in general for
a committee of several catering to
the students and faculty of State
College, Published below will be
found some items indicative of
what we profess to aftcmpt in the
future.

Dear Annabelle:

Excuse this seeming familiarity.
but i feel as thouin l had known
you ever since i pann- to college,
This column offers me an oppor—
tunity to breach :1 question which
hitherto I have kept hidden in my
diary. "To be or not to be“ is
the gist of it all. Do not answer
lhis plea hurriedly but deliberate
over it nights on your pillow.

Should a really nice girl of a
discreet age allow an unusually at-
lrnfivc and very young man to stay
later than 1030 when calling on
Sunday evening?

Senior Prue.

Your inquiry is typical of State
College seniors. Before answering
your question deﬁnitely we must
know if this is not your ﬁrst gen-
tleman caller. Ver likely he feels
the need of a guidiii
Is he, by any chance, a Union
freshman?

Dear Annabelle Ebel:

i am a freshman but I believu I
have attracted the attention of an
iifpper-classman. What shall I do?

Pcrplcxed Dido.

If the young man continues his
attentions ﬁnd out from reliable
sources his ﬁnancial status and, if
satisfactory, go to it; if not, ignore
him and seek further.

Dear Annabelle Ebcl:

Should a senior in college (my
room mate) dye her hair? And am
l expected to pay the taxi driver

, when I ask a young man to accom-

pany me to a formal party? '21

If that'is you; room mate’s only
chance of salvation advise her to
use sage tea daily. Your second
question is diﬁ'icult to answer. It
all depends on who the young man
ia—your brother or some other
girls'.

Dear Annabelle Ebcl:

What would you do in a case like
this? I went to a tea not long ago.
A faculty member handed me some”
tea and crackers. I bit a cracker

g sister hand. ,

 

which was stale. Should  have
eatcnit? Would social obligation
cause me in such a case to risk
indigestion? I

Me.

We desire some detailed in-
formation before we can risk an-
swering such a query.

CHEMISTRY CLUB

Chemistry Club incl Friday at
four o’clock. William Strain, ’Zl,
read a paper on “ Coconuuts." Af—
l’er describing the appearance of
the cocoaniit tree he gave a de
tailed account of the different uses
made of the plant. Rope is made
from the fibre, and the leaves zirc
used for thatch. 'l'he juice dis-
tilled from the flowers is made into
cocoanut wine. The cocoanut it~
self was then considered. During
the war itricoaiiiil shells wurc used
as a source of carbon for gas

'. An interesting and novel
ca me of the cocoauut was ex-
plained, it seems pearls are often
found in L‘ocuamifs having the
same. chemical composition as
lhose found in oysters. Mr, Strain
remarked that this was :1 vrry
timely subject.

After a short business meeting
ibc chib adjourned. ‘

  
 

Professor lirouson has been
home a week with a severe attack
of laryngitis.

Dorothy lianncr, Edna lf‘arshall
and Earl Dorwaldt have charge of
classes in chemistry and general
science at lhc Albany High School.

The second issue of (In: “Her—
inoiic ” will be ready in a week or
two, It has been found advisable
to charge a subscription fee of lif-
feen cents, or live cents per copy,
for the rest of the semester. The
issue will be limited to those who
have paid on or before the date of
publication.

 

SYRACUSE CONFERENCE

Many Teachers Needed

Yes, "Des Moines again at
Syracuse!" Some folks laughed
when the bulletin board said that.
but' it was quite true. The Des
Monies message was brought to
us in several ways many of the
students at the yracuse conven-
tion had been out there; Dr. Sher—
wood Eddy and others of the
speakers spoke to us; we had ac-
cess to .part of the much—talkcd-of
and mysterious “ Exhibit."

Saturday night at the banquet
we were very thankful that we had
had a cheer contest. You should
have heard those colleges yell!
Eighty Cornell delegates. twenty
Elmira girls, twenty—ﬁve Union
men, and all the rest—<t‘hev made
a great showing. Our chance

came When Colgate gave State
College a rousing cheer and we
res ondcd with "l-loi-‘ya, Rahl

Ra l Rah! —— Colgate." We used
most of our yells. Elmira's clever,
peppy songs made as green with
envy. ‘

The student assembly program
for last Friday morningr was quite
varied in its character. After the

lisiin,r the new air of the “Alma

dents to watch the bulletin board

short cheer practise, and urged all
the students—the men, especially
~to support State at the basket—
