Dear Egg1~

Yours of last week received.
Don't be trlliu’ me no more about
' \\'ool\vorlh—l don’t like
her. (hit‘ sewin' club had a party
last '.l.‘hnrsday afternoon an we
lhn’t we'd get our glimmcrs on a

i few girls we'd seen hangin’ around

 

l’earl street. They call that

‘ “ rushin’ " in college, but I don't know

why less it’s cause We're such a
fast bunch. (ice. ling, they‘re some
bunch. They all (5 of ’em) come
(:licwin' unm an blushin' in some
spots '11 gettin' pale in others—-
nice girls! i tho't Marie must be
one of 'em but l didn’t know there
names so 1 walked by them an
says "Egg" softly, but it didn't
seem to make any impression on
them, so .\larie couldn’t been there.

I’m glad you got your marks.
it kinda cheers me up a little. i
you think you got by, 1 must have
gotten A's at least, if not more.
I was kinda sheered fer awhile
here. l'll admit the dean is at»
ways a sociable fella lint lately he's
been a little more intimate with
some. Why he ain't satislicd un-
less he's got a hole hunch outside
his door an‘ then, after waitin’ that
long for him, he tells 'em they’re
apt to go skatin’ too fast on such
thin ice, an they better go home
'till they grow some more, or. to
wait till the rest of the place
ketches up with 'em. He’s always
niakin‘ such personal remarks.

You’d likc'thc teas we have down
here, Egg. They call 'em student
activities or somethin‘ like that.
Gee, there swell, Some girls flit-
ters away on the piano an' a couple
more are teachin' the fellas ‘how to
lead. l guess by the looks most
of the fellas down here are used to
bein’ lead, cause if you say any-
thin’ to ’em when they’re dancin’,
they have to begin to count 7 all
overagain. I heard them teachers
get about 25 cents learnin’ the rest
how to shimmie. but I wouldn’t
give my feet away for 25 dollars
an’ neither would you, Egg. We
got candy aii’ cookies an' tea fer
nothin‘ tho', so it didn’t turn out
so worse. You can play cards too,
Egg. but you got to do it quiet.
cause if you get: botsterous an
slamm-in' your ﬁsts on the table or
rattlin' your cuff buttons or takin’
off your coat. they’re apt to get
suspicious au’ ask you what your
playin’.

I’m glad to hear you been
shovelin’ snow—that will be good
for you later, Egg. But don’t_gct
in the habit of doin’ it all night
cause you'll have to have a better
excuse than that, Yes. I see it's
part out of charity your dom' it.
but when it comes 3 a. 111.. remem-
ber what Pat. Henry said. “Char—

 

ity be his at home or least comes
back tiere.”

don't see why you got G.
Washington's birthday off an’ we
didn’t. (ice, they don’t give you
nothln‘ you don't take down here.
,I bet George was awful mad when

he heard we wasn't cellebratin‘ his.

birthday, but l‘m goin‘ to have one
soon an‘ maybe We’re goin' to have
that off. Of course, Egg, we
kinda specialize in brain develop-
ment down here 50's we couldn't
be ncspected to have so much vaca-
tion as you, could we. eh, Egg?

They had a picnic from here to
Syracuse last week-end. Confer-
ence er somethin‘ like that, they
called it. Somebody come up to
me :m' says. “your invited." llut
then I found out later you had to
pay. an' i had my suitcase all

tred, too. Anyway l. says to
.elf, well. anyway, all the decent
-1 team fellas are engaged so
no sense in me guin', C‘ll
So I unpacked it an' began
life anew in this dump.

i hope you been sick, Egg, Most
cvurybody has so yUll may as well
be film. I come up on the ear with
a man :m’ be was sayin', “ Yes, 5
times from Al :1. m. to 9," So many
people been feelin' like that a lot.
lately. it must he the high cost
of llVlllR’—-'lllCl'0‘S an' epidemic of
that here too. i felt awful sick the
last 3 days but l don’t know what’s
the matter. One of the neighbors
been bringin’ me broth ’n stuff—-
l guess that made it worse. She
said somethin' about flew, I don’t
remember lirst what, but. .[ guess
did, cause l ain’t felt that way
since.

l hate to talk about myself, Egg,
but birthdays will be birthdays an'
they will come on the same day
each year air—mine comes next
Tuesday. 1 got cnuf stockings but

  
 
 
     

' 1 do like gloves.

Yours represSedly,
r \OSL‘.
l", S.—-—Some of the fellas up
when. you are come down to see
their girls ucashunally, Egg—yes?
lx'emenrber, don’t tell me about that
In cent girl no more. never
could stand girls which said, “My
Cawd "—that’s plzijeriziii’,l_‘]3gg.

Distressing Subject

“ What would you like to drink,
sir?” the waiter suggested.

“ Now, see here,“ the patron ex~
claimed peevishly, “what is the use
of wasting my time in telling you,
merely to satisfy what can be only
an idle curiosity, what I would like
to drink? Just; bring whatever im-
happy wetness you are afflicting On
a helpless public at this time, and
say nothing about it."-—Judge.

“ Was the cat on the track?"

" Oh, no. ma’am,” assured the
