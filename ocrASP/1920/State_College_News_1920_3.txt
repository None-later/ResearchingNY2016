GREETINGS

if it’s not too lulu here's the
" .\cw5” board wishing everybody
a Happy New Year! We came
back too late for an issue last
Thursday, but we feel sure the ma-
terial published here will amply
reconipense for last week's loss,
and for the lack of publications
during the next two weeks of
exams. The next number of the
" 'ews” will be the annual junior
issue, to be edited entirely by the
junior members of the board and
published February 5. In the
number following will be published
the list of new "News" board
members from whom a maximum
of ﬁve sophomores will be elected
in May to positions of Associate
Editor for 1920-21. Those who are
trying for these positions should
join Press Club and get busyl

    

 

bon'T WORRY

“The fateful time approaches,

The hour is drawing near.”

No, we have been back at Col-
lcgc only two weeks. although it
does seem a year when we think
of the “ bright prospects ” immedi-
ately before us. Christmas vaca-
tion was so-pleasant and so gener—
ally opposed to study that the con-
trast now seems overwhelming,
But.‘in truth. should we feel that
all pleasure lies behind and only
disaster ahead? We have not for—
gotten everything we ever knew,
and besides we have taken
“ exams " before. In fact. vacation
itself has helped to prepare us to be
equal to the occasion. No matter
how we have spent it—all in
pleasure. all in work, or some of
each —‘we are better prepared be-
cause of it! However, if we have
made a proﬁtable and sensible use
of those days away from College,
so much more will we, conscious of
it or not, reap their real beneﬁt.

During each. semester we have
small VﬂCﬂll()llS-—‘-Ollr. week-ends.
There is some- wnrk to be done
then. it, is trueJnit it is not as in-
tense as through the week. We

is almost the end of this Weekl
there is something doing both Fri-
day and Saturday evening. Give
one or both of them your support
and don't worry about exams.

mastic—Ems DEBATES

We think- a word of praise
should be accorded those who have
been responsible for the inaugura-
tion of inlereluss debates. Here Is
something; which should be entered
into with enthusiasm and winch
should find a permanent place in
our College activities.

These debates will bc.a great
factor in promoting intercluss
rivalry. There are many students
who are loyal supporters of their
classes at all times. but who are un-
able to take an active part in
basketball or other forms of com-
petition where certain physical at—
tributes are essential. Yet some of
these students may be convincng
talkers, just the ones to hold a
place on a debating (cam. in the
Inture they will have a chance to
prove their spirit by takng part.

Moreover, debates will keep us
posted on the important happen- I
logs of the (lay. 'l‘hcy will teach
us the right way to reason. lily
l'V'llllplt: and practice they will
tea 1 us some of the essentials of
public speaking. And lastly they
should prove of as great interest to
the faculty as to the students and
in that way bring them into cltrscl‘
relationship with each other.

If the intcrcluss debating teams
are a success. why not select a
[cum to represent State College?
We could then compete with the
other colleges havng [cams and in
this way make ourselves better
known. We could make it such an
honor to be one of those debaters
that there would be k n cmnpcli—
lion among all lhr eligible candi-
dates.

SPANISH CLUB

   

 

 

Oh, come ye youths and maidens
all, and hear me while l to .
Of all the joys of Spanish Club, for

Last Friday niuht that dear old

thoroughly dispelled.

FEDERAL DEPARTMENT
OF EDUCATION

  

\\"idcspread imcr st throughout
the country—especially in peda-
gogical clrc . —-«hns been aroused
by a bill. which is now before Cou-
g’rcss, to establish a department of
(‘Illlt‘llllllll with a secretary in the
President's cabinet, and lo author—
izc the amn‘oln‘lulion of $lllU,(ll.l(l,(lllll
hy the Federal government to en-
cunrauc the Slates in the promo-
tion of education. '

This bill (loos not mean that the
lfudcrnl government proposes In
assume the control and administra-
tion of education. Such an attempt
would be clearly unconstitutiomll.
nor would it be for the best in-
terest of our public schools. The
Federal government would set up
standards and Show why such
standards should he accepted, but
the authnrity of linal decision in
all educational matters would re-
main in the States, where it is
placed by the tenth amendment to
lhc (‘nnstilutiow

'l'ht- csl'ahllslnncnt of a depart-
ment of education with a sucrotarv
in the President's cabinet would
give to education the recognition
which it justly deserves because of
its vital importance from lht' stainl-
point of national welfare. Through
such a department the Federal gov-
ernment could promolc education

 

 

as it has promoted other great in— ‘

icresls over which it does not have
control. Examples of promotion
without control are found in the
Departmrnl of Agriculture and the
Department of Labor.

MANUAL ARTS CONFER-
ENCE

 

 

Speaking of ‘the high standards

set for industrial teachers at the ,

Manual Arts Conference at the

University of Cincinnati, Professor ,
Douglass. who attended the Con- V

forcnce, stated. that it was de—
clared that college graduation

ought to be required for certifica- 5'

firm to teach manual training in the
«high school. Professor Douglass
was particularly interested in the

report of the Committee in Certifi- .

catinnvof Special Teachers. This
committee would have teachers of

.ellge‘the following new exchange '

 

manual'training well prepared m
professional subjects, both in the
general field of education and ill
their special lieltl. Teachers of
technical subjects are in great de-
mand. but notwithstanding this un-
precedented Scarcity of teachers
and the demand, teacher training
institutions and State ,cducational
authorities should not lower the
standards cvcn temporarily. ~

Professor Douglass says that the
general feelingr expressed here at
Collch is in favor of the four
years' course and its value is rcc«
llR'lllZCfl, but since only two years
are required by the State it is hard
to gut men to stay four years; also
considerini.r that [be two year men
can demand as high a salary as the
four year mun.
