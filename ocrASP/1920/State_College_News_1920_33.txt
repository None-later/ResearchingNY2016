SOMETHING TO THINK
ABOUT

We have had something.r “ undcr
our hat" {or a long time; and we
have kept it there not so much be-
cause we were afraid to say it as
because we hardly knew how to
express our feelings in such a way
that they would not be misunder-
stood. A letter to the editor of
the "News" printed in the issue
for March 4. although not exactly
dealing with the same subject.
brought the matter so vividly
home to us that we are going to
come out with the thing, trustng
that if we are wrong we may be
corrected but not too severely
criticized.

There is a somewhat general
feeling that teaching is a woman’s
job. The great patience and gen-
tle, reasoning faculty which arc
the necessary complements of
modern pedagogy seem to be {mind

 

mostly in women. Yet we do not
agree that. this is cntlrcly a prrr
icssiou for the fair sex. We feel
that there is a great need for the
man teacher. The boy of [0—day
nt'cds someone to act as a big:
brother. Who is more adnplcd
than the man lcuuhcr? if all the
instructors in the United States
were women, do you think than:
would be an adequate developuwm
of those vigorous clntracturislics
which live oung nicn impart In a
country? ch are talking t‘spt'cl-
ally of the u'ainmnr school and

faculties of our higher cdmratinmtl
inslitutions lllll what We always
think of the instructor of a collegi-
class in terms of Hill)” hair, beard,
and trousers.

ll' touching is not distinctly a
woman's position and Int-u arc

why i* it that a man who t‘ngnncs
in it is l‘ugttt‘tlctl as cl'l'cniinnt 
Maybe you think this is uouscns
but we I'ch thal is a rathur (h.-
plorahlo fact. lior instance, this
other day a man whom Wt' rc-
spt-c. id asked us, “What collect:

“Why, l'm goinl,r Io Stan- t‘ol»

“Ah—h. i Sct‘, studying to liL' n

do think that ii a man is constantly
in the society of women, hr will
either partake of the gentle man-

spair to some isolated island or
wilderness far from society, in
either case he is uniittcd to be-
come a teacher, for what boy

is likewise true that a woman cou—
stantly in society with men may
become mannish. Either case is
lamentable. '

The remed We propose is sim-
pic. in colleges like our own

men’s get-togethers, smokers.

TARDINESS AT

it is absurd, to stt)‘ lllu least, for
its Io curlan lllL' aunoyaucc of hav-
ing so many sltldcnls rominp; latr

tardy people outside. .\'o strict
rule can bc' cnl'orcud causing stu-
dents lo either be on time at those
' 'scmblics Ur stay away. A par-
tial honor systcm in this rttspcct
ought be ciicctivc, but it's up to
the student body as a whole to
rt‘alizn that such a system is in
operation.

.\'o drastic steps can be taken if
students absent lhcmsclvos from
I'riday assembly, but nont- should
be necessary. These meetings are
practically the only occasions \rht‘n
we are all together to give ovi-
dencc of what loyalty wc have for
State College.

Effective measures for curing
annoying tardiness can he executed
and certainly will be, when an
audience comprised of our follow
students plainly shows its disap-
proval and disgust occasioned by
habitual tardiness and annoyance.

Friday assembly period begins at
9:05. A good suggestion is that
some class, say l923. sci the ox—
amplc of being in their seats at

dent of voluntarily rcmaiuim:

tainly the rust of us can follow.
