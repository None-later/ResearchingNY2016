IBUT IN THE MEANTIME

 

 

. it's the same subject, handled in
the same old way, but we have a
feeling that it_wi11 fit in now as
well as it has on former occasimis,
We are wondering what has hap-
pened to the undcrclass rivalry.

True it is that the spirit of rivalry
has been kc t alive in various ways
this year. First thcre were several
hazing episodes. Then there was
basketball, and lastly, there were
class days and class debates. But
just at present there seems to be a
lull. It may be that it is the quiet
that precedes a storm. Perhaps
both sides are storing up energy
for a grand outburst.

But ill the meantime, sophs, the
pathway to the eastern entrance
of State College needs shoveling.
And, frosh, there are many little
ways in which you can show that
you are very much alive. It's the
task of the younger students to put
plenty of the spice of life into these
halls of learning. The uppcrclass-
men must “put their noses to the
grindstonc" more and more, and it's
the duty of the underclassmen to
see that they have plenty of diver—
sion, in order that there nerves may
not be shattered by quiet and mo-
notony. '2 ,

AN UNBALANCED
RATION

The function of a teachers’ col-
lege. we are told, is to develop the
teaching personality, since without
this important quality a teacher is
not a teacher but a sponge, who
has managed to sop up some knowl-
edge but cannot of his own power
pass it on. That is all very reason—
able, we must admit, and we fur-
ther admit that this aforesaid and
highly desirable teaching personal-
ity includes more than just the
ability to transmit knowledge. It
demands also the highest mental,
physical, and moral qualities, clean,
forceful manhood and womanhood,
and, above all, a broad knowledge
of the world, a fair understanding
not only of things and their forces,
but of men and their ways. We
come to a teachers' college in order
to develop this personality, but—
after some little experience in the
process of this development, we ﬁnd

we don't approve, and we venture '

 

to state our reasons for the general
nmuscincnt of the puma, ‘
As we meditate upon the subject
at hand, we can't help remarking
the similiarlty of our own views
and those. of our friend, Montaigne,
whom We had the pleasure of meet-
ing through History of Educa-
tion. He did not approve of strenu-
ous methods in education and
neither do wc—iind We aren’t es—
ccinlly lazy either. Only we can’t
just see the efficiency of some of
the things we are forced to do in
this developmental stage and the
first thing that meets with our dis-
approval is, what we feel to be, an
excessively high standard of marks.
We grant that a high standard of
scholarship is desirable, but when it
gets so high that, like the cost of
living, it becomes uncomfortable,
we object. For it necessitates
"grubbing" to maintain a satisfac—
tory average, and somehow " grub-
bing“ has a tendency to inhibit
sunnincss of our disposition and
foster an undesirable irritability,
the result ‘of the continued drain
upon nervous energy that " boning"
requires. Also, it very effectively
curiails general rcadin r, since a
tired brain absolutely rc liscs to be
interested in anything that requires
mental effort.. Worst of all, in our
humble opinion, we are forced to
stop thinking—or, call it philos—
ophiziug, if you will, for we mean
the thinking that does not concern
itself with the subject-matter of a
textbook—and that is the crown-
ing blow, for thought seems to us
to be essential for the true develop-
ment and orientation of self.
Therefore, we object to an exces-
sive standard of marks, and we
wonder why we have one in a
teacher’s college or in any college.
While we are at it We also vcn—
ture to look somewhat asknnce at
assignments. We realize, of
course, that we have only four years
of college and that our assign-
ments are adjusted to cover a cer—
tuin length of time. Vcry wcll, bin;
why try to teach us all about a
subject now? We haven't any Vt’l'y
great desire to acquire as much
knowledge as possible about each
course we take in college—at least
not to the exclusion of everything,r
else. We need a pretty good new
cral knowledge for a foundation,
but we are even constrained to be-
lieve that a smaller foundation in
book knowledge is preferable to a
limited foundation in life knowl-
edge. whether we are going to
teach or whether we are going to
do something else. Consequently,
when it requires something like ten
or fifteen hours a day for classes
and the preparation of assignments,
we object once more. if so much
is to be used for these, when, we ask
you. are we to read, to study, to
think, to live. And where and how
are we to acquire the higher quali-
fications of a teacher if the develop—
ment of these quaiﬁcntions is sacri-
ficed to the garnering of subject—
inattcr and the preparation of as-
signments? If we are to teach it is
obvrous that we are not the only
ones who will feel the effect of the
conﬁning, narrowing influence of an
excessively high standard of marks
and too long assignments. Think
it over. ' ’21.

ABOUT STUDENT
ASSEMBLY

Friday morning Assembly is get-
ting to be a very pleasant affair of
late, since the interclass debates
have begun, The ﬁrst one was ex-
tremely interesting, as well as the
second. Undoubtedly those which
follow will be 'just as pleasant.
Usually, unless something out of
the ordinary is going to happen,
everyone is glad of an opportunity

 

 

 

to stay away. But no one is heard
mentioning such a thing when one
of the debates is scheduled, ‘

Debates are not the only attrac-
tion, but [hero I are the class
“ stunts " as well. These show the
(1011ch some of the talent that she
really has, and make the students
more enthusiastic, for they have a
real part to play in the life of the
institution.

Since we have seen the success
which comes from the plans which
have thus far been carried out, we.
should be anxious to do our part in
Continuing them, That does not
mean during the rest of this year
alone. but in the years which are
coming. ~22.

To the Editor of the News:

Undoubtedly the majority of the
student body appreciates the nt‘
tempt which has been made to con-
duct interclass debates in student
nuscmbly. Both debates have been
worth while, from the viewpoints
of the participants and of the audi-
ence. The value of such work is
not to be questioned. Nothing
should be said to discourage such
debates.

But, there seems to be it general
feeling on the part of the students
that the preparation evidenced
might better have been devoth to
a question of more general interest.
There are many vital problems in
our student life about which differ-
ing opinions are held. A debate on
such a problem would be doubly
valuable. The students Would gain
just as much in reasoning ability,
organization of material and tech—
niquc of debate. The audience
would be interested and attentive
from another reason than a sense of
duty.

The final debate between the
seniors and the freshmen will
arouse interest. if it is about some
local qucstioii we'll all be in chapel
Carly. —’20.

THAT SOPHOMORE
, SOIREE

 

A meeting of the sophomore
class was held Friday, March 12,
at which time the soirec was dis-
cussed. it is to be held on April
19 in our college gymnasium and
will be formal. Sophomores, this
is a chance to show our class spirit!
Everyone was well pleased at the
way in which our stunt went off.
Let us make our soircc equally suc-
ccssful. And if it is to be .1 success
each niic's support must be given.
We must go into it wholeheartedly,
and make it an entire class affair——
not one of a few couples. We
should not fail to realize that we
are helping to establish one of the
sophomore class precedents. For
future sophomore classes it SDll’Ce
Will be as certain as is a junior
prom, if the clnss of ’22 makes its
snirce a success. ——'22.

 

 

KEEP A-SMILING

 

u

Fate uscd me nicnnly, but I looked
at her and laughed,

That none might know the bitter-
ncss of the cup I qiiaf‘fcd.

Along came joy, and paused bc-
stdc me, where I sat,

And said, i came to sec what you

were laughing at."

'Whosc_ patience has not been
tried during these past weeks by
storms and cars and drifts and all
such things. Then, there seems to
be something always going wrong
and we wish everything might be
perfect. How numerous are the
bothersome things if one sets out to
find them: Tint after all, "a
troublc’s what you make it." Let
us smile at our trials handed down

 

from " Fate ”— not a dcfiant, [-
don’L-czirc sinilc~but one of cheer-
ful acceptance. Thcn "joy" Will
be standing- beside you sooner than
you expect. ~’22.
