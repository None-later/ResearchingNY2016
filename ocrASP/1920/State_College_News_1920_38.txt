has been head of the School at Du-
quesne, I’cnn. Although greatly
interested in educational work, he
took note of the possibilities of-
fered in the gas well district and
organized a small company to lin-
ance the drilling of three wells on a
portion of land he had leased. Two
of the wells have been drilled. the
second being:r one of the best pro—
tlttcvt‘s of natural gas in that (lis<

 

drict. If the third well, which is‘

nearly completed, turns out to be
as productive as the other two, Mr.

wealthiest l’eimsylvanians.
