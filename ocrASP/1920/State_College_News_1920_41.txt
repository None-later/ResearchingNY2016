THE Purina" AND GOLD -

” When the Iroquois roam‘ed in the
days that are past,
Ere our fore-fathers came o’er the

sea,

Where the Hudson rolls mightily
down from the North

Stands our dear Alma Mater, S. C.

Minerva has guided her wisely and

we ,

May she guard her for ages un-
o ,

Till thousands will sing as we sing
ere to- ay '

To the praise of the Purple and
Gold "

Thereiii lies a text. From it an
eloquent and Interesting sermon

'thait would ﬁll a good-Sized book

could be‘ written apropos to the
fact that State College has lived.
in living, and will live. And, though
lacking talent, time, and space,
there is something in that text
which’c‘oinpels us to express our
thoughts and feelings in our rough
and Inadequate way.

State College is not a large place.
Rather, she is a homelike, little
Institution, where everybody knows
everybody else; where everybody
waves his hand at everybody else
and says, "Hello"; andehere

   

I had, on smile-non to the

her of the'

 

 

everybody calls everybody else by
his nick-name. ' It is'not a [see
where grand and specious ha] 5 in-
spire awe, but a Place where a wou-
ilerl'ul spirit of )rotlierhood greets
the newcomer. State does not
aspire to the greatness of Yale or
HarVard. She‘ sincerely respects
them, but yet she does not‘trino
copy them. They have their ind
of greatness, and she has. here.
It is an independent and individual
greatness.

Within the walls where [the Pur-
ple and Gold hold swa is a true
democracy. Each stutent has a
part to play in the activities of the
whole. No one is left out. There
is equal reciprocity. The Alma
Mater makes the students, and the
students all help to make the Alma
Mater. They are not great in num-
bers, but they have a spirit which
distinctly belongs to State College.
It is this spirit which enables her
,to successfully compete With insti-
tutious of greater size. It is this
spirit which keeps all the organi-
sations within the college going,
promotes class rivalry, and makes
her one of the liveliest institutions
in the Empire State.

Then there is. sonicthlnghigger

’in that State College spirit. All

the students have the greatest
reverence, for their colors; but,
when the country calls, the Purple
and Gold merges into the Red,
White and Blue. .The war record
was one hundred per cent. The
peace record will equal it; for
what is more patriotic than devot-
ing your life to the training of
American citizens?

And those students who have
gone forth‘from Statc'College are
still loyal to the colors. They are

- a wonderful bunch of good fellows,

those Alumni. Wherever they are
'_th’ey' boost their Alma Mater. The
undergraduates of the college can
appreciate this lOyalty. When they
ﬁnally go'forth 'to do their duty
in the school of life, they too, will
b005t; and, wherever they are, they

twill always take off their hats to

the Purple and Gold. .

' BUSINESS MANAGERSHIP

 

4 If .you have not already been
business or advertismg manager of
a high school publication, you have

“no idea of the joys and opportuni-

ties this work holds, 1 have had
considerable experience getting ad-
vcrtisements for a high school pub-
lication besides the work done for
the “ News " and know that I have
proﬁted thereby.

You meet business men‘ in a busi—
ness way and get a view of affairs
in the outside world which any
amount of studying or other work
in college can never give, It gives
a better idea of various types of
people to study a method of ap-
proach for each individual; a ready
mud to think out arguments to
show that it is of beneﬁt to adver-
tisp. in' your particular paper; an
ability to write business letters in
the mad effort to induce enter.
prises outside the city to advertise
in your paper with a favorable
reply to your appeal. It develops
a sense of responsibility in that
you handle large amounts of money
and must keep an account of it,
also to keep track of the terms
for -which the advertisements are
to be printed, ‘

' It has been difﬁcult to get stu-
dents mtcrestcd in this work and
to get them to try out for business
manager; but if they knew the
benefits derived therefrom, we
should have a great number of stu-
dents asking us about it instead

   

 

of our being compelled to go to
them. So, 1924, be, interested lll
lhis work not only for your own
benefit, but for the benefit of the
“ News " and State College. ’

as YE GIVE, so SHALL YE
RECEIVE

it is the old law of compensation
——au eye for an eye, a tooth for a
tooth. If the fullness of life is
yours, it is because you have given
your utmost and best. And we
want people like that here; people
who have the big vision; people
who realize the worth of the indi-
vidual and individual groups, yet
who see them but as a part of a
perfect whole. We want here .at
State College the person who
values knowldege, not as a means
of satisfying personal ambition, lint
who values it for its own sake.
We are holding our standards high.
We are asking each to measure up
to the highest star. In short, we
are asking him to Give, to Do, to
Be; and in return we promise hap~
piness and contentment.

THOUGHTS 0N TEACH-
ING

 

One of the greatest services ‘hat
anyone can render to the peop'... of
his own generation, and to the peo-
ple of the generations to come is
the passing on of knowledge and
of truth which has been handed
down to him from his ancestors.
Every man is a teacher in some
measure then, even if he has no
desire to be one. Yet, a teacher
proper, that is, one who has taken
up this vocation as his life work——
stands upon a different plane en-
lirely. A teacher, in this sense of
the. word, passes on the knowledge
which has become part of him in
such a way that the mind of his
pupil is nnprejudiced and left open
for the formation of its own con-
clusions. Of course, the teacher's
ideas and standards do inﬂuence
his pupil's attitude to some extent,
but he strives hard to teach his
charges to think and to act for
themselves. He tries to mold their
standards of right and wrong, in
political and economic questions,
not into the path of his own ideals
but into the forms recognized by
the best authorities. Then, too,
one of the greatest purposes of‘a
worth-while teacher is to instill
into these eager minds that have
been placed under his guidance, a
great desure to use their talent and
their ability for the honor and
glory of their native land.

 

 

It is an awe-inspiring thou ht
that comes to us w en we realize
that in the hands of our school
teachers lies the future of our
country—for the school children
of to-day are the men and women
of the great tomorrow. The suc-
ccss or failure of America, when
she is exposed to the dangers and
trials of this readjusted world, lies
in the hands of these children—
zmd in their teachers of to-dlay.

COLLEGE YEARS THE
BEST

 

This appeal leads naturally to the
consideration of college life not in
its individual, but in its social
aspect, and to this we now turn.
After all, the most pronounced in—
dividuality would have no signiﬁ-
cancc if it were not for the rela~
tionships in which it is placed. it
is the interplay within these rela-
tionships that gives human life its
value. Here are worked out the
great ideals of society. Here human
interests are cultivated, inﬂuence
is exerted and progress is made.
One of the things young folks go
to college for is to study these
relationships, the laws which gov-
ern them, the ideals of life which
may he developed out of them,
and the modes of conduct best
suited to attain these ideals. This
large field of achievement comple-
ments that of formal knowledge,
and is of highest importance in
lifting the college graduate for his
work-in the world.

It is no mistaken judgment which
has led to the oft-repeated remark
that the four years spent in college
are “ the best years of one’s life."
To make them truly the best, each
student should endeavor to grasp
as comprehensively as he can the
significant relationships which col~
loge life affords.

In the ﬁrst place, he should hold
precious the relationship which he
creates in coming to college—the
one the new student thinks most
about is the ﬁrst days at college,
namely, the relationship with home
and the dear ones whose interest
fondly follows him. It is wrong to
think of going to college as break-
ing home ties. As an institution in-
fluencing young life, the college
should aim to deepen the student’s
love for those he has left behind,
and to strengthen his devotion to
that one spot on earth, however
humlilc it be, which he reverently
calls home. As the pursuits of the
scholar lead him into realms of
knowledge far aﬁeld and develop
within him ideals and tasks possi-
bly transcending those of his home,
let these not cstrange him, or in
any wise lead him to despise the
days of his youth.

In the first days at college, Stu-
dents' hearts will be disturbed a
little with excessive feelings as
new associations crowd rapidly in
upon them, but they should feel no
misgivings with reference to the
outcome. The members of the
faculty, their fellow-students and
the people who make up the com-
munity in which the college is lo-
cated, all want their life here to be
happy and successful. Every stu-
dent can safely take that for
granted, But inﬁxing his attitude
toward lhese newly-made friends.
he should not assume that he is to
the sole beneﬁciary, He is in- col-
lege not only to get, but to give.
There is not one who does not
have some talent to invest, some
hidden grace to bestow, that shall
permanently add to the ever row-
ing and enriching spirit whic we
call “college life."
