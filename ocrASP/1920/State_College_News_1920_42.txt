SEND THE GIRL TO-COL-
LEGE

 

College education for wbmcn
isn’t a fad any longer; it is an
economic necessity. It has so
many advantages, in this extremely
complex modern life of ours, that
every parent who can, nowadays,
gives his daughter a course at one
of the institutions of higher learn—
ing.

And why shouldn’t a girl go to
college? The Ol( theory about
women's brains being so much
smaller than men’s that obviously
lliltlll‘c llCVCl‘ lTlClilli \VOlllL‘fl [0 (ii)
anything intellectual was exploded
long ago. _Whether we like it or
not, women are entering more and
more these days into the work of
the world. And the great war,
which involved as as it involved
England for over four years, has
made women‘s part in the world's
aﬁ’airs more pronounced than ever
it was before.

No need to enlarge upon the al-

most limitless ﬁelds of endeavor
now open or opening to women. in
every intellectual occupation you
can think of you will ﬁnd eminent
women workers. Women have
gone far tn science. There are
many women practitioners of law.
Women have turned their hands
to literature and have scored more
successes in some of ils depart~
tnents than men.
' It is a mistake to suppose that
the proper kind of college train-
ing unflts a woman for domestic
life. it is perfectly true that you
can ﬁnd feminine extremists, en-
thusiastic followers of a thousand
fads and "isms," who have suf-
fered in- their womauliness by the
channels into which their minds
have been turned. But these are
abuses rather than uses of feminine
education. Proper higher educa-
tion for women should be founded
on the ﬁrm and broad basis of a
recognition of woman’s ﬁrst mis—
sion —that of keeping a home and
raising a family.

With this as a starting point,
education can only make woman
more womanly, more helpful in the
home and in the larger circle of
social and civic life. Women-’5 col-
leges, and the great universities
as well, offer courses which ﬁt
women for splendid and useful
parts in life.

Take the domestic science
courses, for instance. Out in our
big Middle West you will ﬁnd many
a farmer’s wife who has gone
through college. Has she proﬁted
by her ft ' years there? Doesn't
it seem a rather ludicrous waste
of time for a woman who is going
to marry a farmer, who is going
to be tied for the rest of her life,
to the strictest kind of domesticity?
Look at her husband’s bank ac-
count, analyze the methods pursued
on his farm. reckon up the tally of
efﬁciency shown there, and you will
ﬁnd the answer. The wife's col-
lege course has lifted the mortgage
on many a farm.

Obviously, a “college course for
women” has_taken on a very dif—
fereut meaning of late years from
that which one attached to it. Be-
fore womcn awakened to the possi-
bilities of modern life a “college
course " meant some polite school-
ing in studies that were of little
practical use. Now women who
go to- college do so for a very
deﬁnite purpose. They go because
they have mapped out for them-
selves some deﬁnite career.

Every year more women enter
upon- business life. The modern

tendency is for women to be self-

Utilizing Nature’s Power

ELECTRICAL energy generated by water power
has grown to be one of our greatest natural
resources—and We have only begun to reach its

wheels of industry, drives our street care and lights
The power obtained from
Nature saves many million tons of coal every year.

supporting. In our grandfather’s
day the woman who “worked for
a living” was rather frowned upon
The conservatives of her day felt
that she somehow lost her woman’s
birthright by getting into business
New women can’t keep out of busi-
ness if they want to. The demands
of present-day affairs make women
a necessary part of the economic
system. Women are out of fashion
if they do not do some kind of
work. Even wealthy women are
seeing the wisdom and advantage
of ﬁtting themselves for careers,
even though they should never
have to make use of their knowl-
edge. And the wise woman, real-
izing that what is practically an
economic law forces her into work
of some kind, endeavors to ﬁt herd
self by proper schooling for work
that will be congenial, elevating
and at the same time proﬁtable.

 

CREATIVE GENIUS

“ l-Iave women any real creative
genius, or have men a monoply?
How does the feminine mind differ
from that of man. And,were Rosa
Bonheur, George Eliot, and Mm.
Curie abnormal? Dr. Kristine
Mann, one of America’s most dis-
tinguished _wome'n' physicians,
answers these questions in a sur-
prising manner in the Pictorial
Review for April. Dr. Mann was
appointed to supervise the health
and moral welfare of the Govern-
ment's thousands of women war
workers, and she knows what she
is talking about”. ,This article
should be of great interest ‘to
State College students.
