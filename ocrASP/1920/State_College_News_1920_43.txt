Coach Clark
VARSITY- BASKETBALL

State College faced a difﬁcult
problem at the opening of the
basketball season. Four of the men
who made up last year's team had
graduated, and it was necessary to
form a team’out of new material.
But with the ” never die" spirit
which has. always characterized
her, State faced the odds and built

up a team which, though it did'not'

quite equal the brilliant record of

last year, was one'to be proud of.
I The Coach

W. J. Clarke came toState Col-

lege at a time when expert ability,

was needed. While other colleges
were getting back their star athletes,
the Purple and Gold had lost some
of her best. There was grave dan-
ger of a slump'in athletics which
would have lowered the high
standard State has set up for her-
self. How the'coach ﬁlled that
need and entered into the spirit
of the situation is a long story.
Through indefatigable eﬁ‘orts and
great patience, he made a team
which in- passwork was superior to
any that the college has had.
State College indeed owes a great
deal to Coach Clarke.

The Manager

Manager Schiavone arranged a
ﬁne schedule for the year. The
list included such colleges as Col-
gate, Union, Middlebury, Clarkson,
and Tec . here were thirteen
games, nine of them were home
games. The way in which
Schiavone looked after all matters
necessary for the success of these
games indeservin of. praise. He
was aided byAssistar‘it Manager’s
Bliss and Strain and underclass
assistants _Linck and Foster. '

Polt
Captain Pelt (‘l Dutch ") returned
to State College after a year’s ab-
scence; and, when the basketball
season'opened, he was one‘of the
ﬁrst to don a suit. As a guard he
is one of our trusties. He plays

' an aggressive game, and is a man-

who can be absolutely relied upon.

His motto is always "get that,

ball." We are sure of a successful
season in 192041, 'for "Dutch"
will be here to lead the team.

Springmsnn .

would remain un aralleled. ‘
is an expert payer..and ranks
among the very best in the State,

U I. but unfortunately helis handicapped

byazbsd knee. He would have
wan' his letter in previous years:
but, While. playing on the team in
two successive seasons, he re-
ceived i'n‘urics to his knee which
preveute further .playiiig. But,
when he knew that the Purple and
Gold needed his services, he for:

' got his own inconvenience. By
the ind-ofAscvcral‘bandagcs,"s‘pliccsT

and braces he ﬁxed up his, knee,
and led the offensive of the team
in all itscourt contests. His pass-
work, dribbling, and shooting feat-

» tired every game; and he heads the

list of individual records. There
is a case of pure grit. There is one
of the best exam les we can cite

‘ of true 'State Col ege spirit. This

is ,Springmann’s last year. State
will miss him when he goes; but
she is proud to claim him as one of
her men, and feels sure that he
will make good anywhere.

Cue-vent

“Ted” showed up in ﬁne style
rm the floor, and he made a record
for himself. He is thetﬁrst State
College man to score seven ﬁeld
baskets against Col ate, and he did
it on their court. e is a consist-
cnt player, and a big point-getter.
We are looking for some great
work from him next year,

, .. Manon

Masspn is a true product of the
class' teams. This was his ﬁrst
regiilarla pearance in the varsity
line-up. e proves that interclass
basketball does bring forth ﬁne
varsity material. Sw1ft and sure
of shot he was a strong addition
to the team. A streak going up
the floor, that was Masson; and,
when once he got started, there
was no holding him as Manhattan

.found out to their sorrow. He is

another man that State will miss
next year. '

Lobdell

“Van” was the only man left
of last year’s team. e is the
same “ Good Old Van,” always on
the job. He has a way of getting
the ball and passing to the right
man at the right moment which
has made him one of the best back
court.men State has ever had.
“ Van " also leaves this year. The
college will always remember his
ﬁne work on the team.

Johnson '

“Jack” came to State College
from Milne High School, where he
made'a record as a good all-around
athlete. He showed up in ﬁne
style on the squad this year, and
we are counting on him for one
of our strong men next year.
" Jack " is a heady player, and he
knows exactly how to ﬁt into all
the plays of the team.

McCluer

“ Jack " McCluer came from
Cornell. Immediately upon his ar-
rival at State College, however, he
entered into the spirit of the Pur-
ple and Gold as if he had been
here right along. As a basketball
player he is fast, clean, and always
wide awake. He is another good
man for next year's team.

Hathorn
" Shorty " would have easily
made his letter this year if he had

not unfortunately been taken sick
right in the middle of the season.
He is showing up mighty ﬁne and
can fool any guard with his 'lcit

hand shot. He will make a good 4

center for the coming season.

McCafferty .

guards that State has ever had.
He is always after the ball with
all the vim and energy he has.

Miller
Last year "Wade" was a
“ scrub," doing ﬁne work opposing
the varsity in practice but not get-
ting an opportunity to play in the
big games. This year he won a
berth on the regular squad by his
hard work and perseverance. and
he is forging steadily ahead. Go
to it, " Old Boy," and the best of
luck in the coming seasons.

The Cheer Leader

If anyone doubts that "Gus"
Crablc is a peppy cheer leader he
should watch him lead the "Sky-
rocket" or the “Locomotive.”
You have to yell when‘ he's up
front, for he works hard himself
and he makes you work. And not
only did ".Gus ' show great leader-
ship in cheering the team on to
victory, but he also wrote this
year’s prize yell.

Assistant cheer leader Fiscus has
already shown us what he can do.
We have the greatest conﬁdence in
-l1is ability to ﬁll the bill as cheer
leader for 1920-21.

BASEBALL

Due to the war, State College
has not done much in the line of
baseball for the past few years.
This year, however, baseball has
a prominent place on our athletic
program, and although our sched-
ule does not consist of a great
number of games, we are, neverthe-
less, playing some of the bigger
colleges of the East. _

We open our season on April
24 with St. Stephen's College at
Aniiandalc. Our ﬁrst home amc
is on May 7 when we play or-
cester Tech. on the Ridgeﬁeld
Park diamond.

Much enthusiasm is shown by the
fellows for baseball this year. At
the ﬁrst call for practice by Coach
Clarke, on March 15, ﬁfty men
made their appearance on the gym
floor, and the way they are digging
in gives abundant evidence that we
are going to have some baseball
team.

Several men are trying out for
"pill slingers" and they are show-
ing ﬁne ability. Amongthese are:
Johnson, last year's star pitcher 0n
the Milne High nine; Bliss who
has had several year’s experience
in the box, and Pep Hathorn who
has the making of a good pitcher.

Several men are showing ex-
cellent receiving ability. Spring-
mann will, perhaps, occupy ﬁrst.

Talk about ﬁelding, the old vet-
eran, Cassavant, knows how it’s
done. Many men are out for the
other positions and Coach Clarke
says it will be a problem to pick

. the best ones, for they’re all good.

TRACK AT STATE COL-
LEGE

Beginning with September, 1919,
track has occupied a place in the
athletics of State College, and con-
siderable interest has been shown.

During the ﬁrst week,’ Coach
Clarke entered a' team at Ridge-
ﬁcld Park in the Twilight athletic
meet. Notwithstanding the fact
that the boys had had no training
whatever, they started off with the
spirit of winners and captured sec-
ond place in a relay race. The team
was composed of Hathorn, Baker,
MeCIuer and Neuner. Hathorn
wnn third place in a 440.

Throughout the early fall much
training was done in preparation
for the annual cross~county run
which usually occurs during the
latter part of October. The day
wet, and unfavorable for distance
selected for the event was warm,
