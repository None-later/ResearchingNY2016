a dozen men were ready to com-
pete. First place was taken by T.
Bentley, second by J, Neiiner and
third by L. Masson.

State also entered a team at the
indoor track meet at the Armory
in January. On account of the fact
that not many men were available
for track wiiile basketball was in
full swing, the splende attempt
made (.‘lt that occasion did not
bring victory. .

In March, Coach Clarke issued
his ﬁrst call for the spring track
practice. well-reinforced team
will he sent to compete in the in—
tercollegiate meet at the Armory
on March 27, and it is also thought
that the State boys will enter the
intercollegiate meet at Springﬁeld
later in the spring.

n Moving-up Day a general
college track meet will be held,
all four classes of the college pnr‘
tieipatiug.

The students of the college have
supported basketball in an admir~
able fashion throughout the sea-
son. Since no one could venture
to say that track is not every bit
as interesting in all of its phases.
the trackm'en are eager to have

'the same interest shown toward

their line of work.

HOCKEY

 

Under the management of Cassa-
vant, hockey was revived at State
College this year. A new rink was
erected but difﬁculty was encoun-
tered in ﬂooding it, so opportunity
for practice was restricted. Still
with the usual spirit of State, the
team played its schedule.

Although State came, out second
in the games played, the team put
up a strong ﬁght in every instance.
Union, especially, remembers how

 

Cassavant, ably assisted by Kaag,
Neuner and Gray, repeatedly car-
ried the puck down the rink and
threatened her goal; while Fergu—
son, Lobdell and Hoffman put up
an impenetrable defence. The
teams played represented institu-
tions with much greater facilities
for turning out strong teams than
State. They were West Point
Military Academy, Union and
Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute.

Kaag, Ferguson, Hoffman, Neti-
ner, Gray, Cassavant, Lobdell, Mil-
ler, Foster and Levine deserve
credit for the showing of the team.
And it is expected that the experi-
ence gained this year will be of
great value in the formation of a
team next year.

INTER-CLASS BASKET-
BALL

 

Seniors Champions Four Years

 

This year's inter-class games
were the best that State College
has ever bad. They were all evenly
matched and spirited contests.
When the regular schedule for the
ﬁrst semester was ﬁnished there
were two ties, one between the
seniors and juniors for ﬁrst, place.
and one between" the sophs and
trash for thirdplace. Two extra
games were' played. in order to de-
cide these ties.- First place went
to the seniors in a close game by a'
score of 18 to 16. Third place went
to the sophs by a score of 12 to
[0 in another close contest.

Before varsity practice starts all
the men in the college may play
on the class teams. After practice

 

 

starts, however, the men on the
squad do not play in the inter—class
contests. This means that a large
number of men have n‘chance to
take part in this form of sport.

This year the seniors were repre-
sented on the court by Springs
mann, Masson, Ferguson, Lobdell.
Nicholson, Force, Holman, Mc~
Malion, Costellano, Schiavone and
Levine. It was Coste'llano’s foul
shooting that won the champion-
ship for the seniors. ‘

The juniors were represented by
H. Polt, Cassavant, McCluer,
Hathoru, Baker, Bliss, Bucci, Sher-
lock, Hakes, Bentley, E. Polt,
Strain and liruec. Bucci's shoot-
ing won an overtime game and
tied the juniors with the seniors
for ﬁrst place.

For the sophs, there were Mil—
ler, Linck, Keenan, Schoenberg,
Hiinmelstein. Baldwin, Breslau and
Foster. Keenan‘s neat ﬁeld basket
won the underclass championship
for the sophs. -,

And last but not least the fresh
were represented ,by' Johnson,
Stewart, Fiscus, Riley, Dobris,
Landon, Hill and Gray. Stewart
was a good all-around man for the

The‘rc was'not a‘sccond semester
series, but the odds and 'e'vens com-
bined and 'bad a preliminary to
one of the varsity games. 'It was
a close game, and' the‘;o'dds.w6n

by a score o;f'6‘to '4. ., .

The li'ne~up fOrilbzi-23 was' Bliss,
Bucci,. Sherlock, Fiscu's,‘ Riley and
Gray. Sherlock was the»~'ii‘idiyidual

' star. ‘

The lineaip' for 1920-22 “.was
Nicholson, Ferguson, '.Co‘stell'ano,
Holman, Force and Linck. 'Linék
was the indigidual star. . ‘ * ,i

The grand ﬁnale of the se‘asdn
Will be a game between the two
upper classes with the varsity men
playing. This will be the fastest,
closest, and most interesting con-
test of the season.
