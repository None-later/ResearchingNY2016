Basketball has always been the.
ma or sport at State for both men.

an ‘women. ac wintentwelve
inter-class games are playgd on the
indoor court.‘ The winning team
receives the championship honors.
The squads for each class are
chosen in the fall and, are we
captained and mana ed. It is cus~
tomary for the junior captain to
coach the members of the fresh-
man team. Letters are awarded
those who played on the champion-
ship team and numerals to those
on other teams who played in three
whole or seven half games. ;
*There is a rent deal of rivalry
between the c asses over the teams
they put forward. The games are
fast enough to interest not only
the women but the men also. This
year there is some question about
the awarding of the championship
—both junior and sophomore
teams being fairly evenly matched.
Youth and old age, as represented
by the freshmen and seniors, are

out of the race. "'Everybody has.

his day "-— the seniors in the past
the freshman, let us hope, in the
future.
The line-up of this year‘s team
is as follows:
Senior Team——
Florence Bohne, forward.
Ellen Donahue, forward.
Sarah Adrianne, forward. ,
Dorothy Mulholland, guard.
Madilene Gonard, guard (Jan-

uary .

association is supported by nominal
dues and by an appropriation from

elected early in the fall and. they,
with the advice andassistance of
the physical education instructors,
plan the work 'for the coming

ear. .
y Last October, G. A. A. planned
and carricd'out a series of hikes.
’ hese trips to various places
around Albany were taken on Sat~
nrday afternoons. There are al‘
ways "cats" and songs and an
abundance of good fellowship.
During the winter, the major
sport is basketball. The series of

alntcr-class 'games exmte great
tivalry. This year the. juniors and
and sophomores are evenly

matched. Both teams are striving
valiantly for the championship.
it's a great pity they cannot both
be victorious. . .

The frolics are the affairs fos-
tered by G. A. A. most universally
attended. ,Evcryone comes pre-
pared to have a good time, and they
have it! Dean Pierce comes and
smiles benignly upon us, and we
all believe she has as good a time
as the rest of us. Sometimes Miss
Bennetts sings or Miss Card
dances. Besides we have a great

' deal of local talent when one looks

carefully enough for it.

In the spring when young folks’
fancies lightly turn toward out-of-
doors, the tennis tournmcnt is run
off. As in basketball there is a
great deal of competition; but nii-
like basketball it is only individual
competition. (Why can‘t we have
an inter-class series? We can if
more of you girls will come out and
learn to Wield your rackets.)

It is unnecessary to dilate fur-
ther on the many duties of the as-
sociation. It’s a most vital part
of State. Its success and the suc-

cess of girls' athletics depend upon
it. May the incoming classes sup-
port it_as well as the classes now
upholding it.

A Good Place to Hike
HIKES

 

“ Merrily we wzilk along, o’er the
rocky ma 5

Merrily we sing State songs, when
we ride in loadsl”

Who is the most unfortunate girl
in college? I shall tell you, She
is the girl who has so many
academic duties that she can't go
on G. A. A. hikes. Strange to say
the grciitcst'numbcr of grils like
this are freshmen. On all our hikes
we find it few of them. a few more
sophs, still more juniors and a
great many seniors. Of course,
this is due not only to the greater
Wisdom on the part of the seniors
in putting off: work to be done,
but it is due also to the fact that
they have awakened to the knowl-
edge that they have missed many
jnlly times.

Every year G. A. A. holds two
big hikes to Indian Ladder beside
the smaller weekly ones. Several
loadsful of girls, with lunch boxes
and cameras start off in big trucks
early iii the morning. Disembark-
mg after a very jiggly ride, in
these same trucks, which we whisw
per _we strongly suspect of having
carried morc aromatic spirits in
their day, everyone takes excel-
lent care that the freshmen are
loaded to the gunwales with skirts

 

 

and cameras and last but not least

 

 

the lunch boxes. The older meni-
hers of the party, mostly seniors,
jog slowly up the-trail, but the
nndcrclassmcn run, c'iicli trying to
outclimb the * other. If is the
undcrclassmen, too, who. pursue e
the trails at breakneck speed to the
horror of the se'niors‘vwho wish to
gaze at the familiar places for per-
haps the last time. At even, wc
descend the mountain tired and J},
dirty' but happy and content.
intcr's grasp is broken now,
and tho' it’s unpleasant, we are
willing to Wilde knee deep in trick—
ling water siHCe we know it's really
spring that is approaching and
with her return, again we hike.
course, we cannot always ‘go to
Indian Ladder, but the shorter
hikes to Normanskill. chssclacr,
Troy and the Country Club are
just as full of fun. All out, ye who
would make your colle e days rich
in experiences and joly times.

SWIMMING

 

The Physical Ed. Society has
established a new custom. On the
iith of March the girls of State had
the first of il series of swimming
parties. The first night the event
look the form of it party upon to
all who could and couldn’t swim.
Since then regular instruction has
been givcn to those ‘wishing to
loiirn the different strokes. 'Undcr
Miss Card’s very capable super-
vrsion the learning process prom-
ises to be soon accomplished. This
instruction is open to all college
girls. Notices are posted on the
locker key bulletin with full par-
ticulzirs. Watch for them and sign
up, if enough girls are interested
a competitive, either class or indi- P.
vidiial, meet could be arranged.

Why should we not rival each

other in this phase of atlilctics'as

well as in basketball or tennis? 1
Everybody out and give Miss Ciii'd

a chalice to show you how it is

done.

RECRUITING TEACHERS

Continued from Page 1

below full registration. The New

York State Normal Schools have

50 per cent or less of their usual v
registration. State College has 73
per cent-of its pro-war registration.
The present status of teaching
might be presented under the fol-
lowing heads:

:1. Salaries have increased ‘Lr
over 1915 by 100 per cent to
mg per cent as shown by the
salaries so far obtained by the
class of 1920.

b. While these increases are
larger than for other profcs“
sious and vocations the great-
est encouragement lies in the
fact that tcacliers’ salaries are
not likely to decrease when the
break in prices comes. '

c. The teaching service is
rapidly coming into its own, to
he recognized as ii public scrv— .1
ice greater in value than the
service rendered by physicians,
lawyers, engineers, etc. The -.
welfare of our country is in .v
very large measure in the
hands of the teachers. This
gives dignity to the profession \
and is daily increasmg public
respect for teachers and teach-

mg.

The President wishes the State
College students to make a special
plea for the Norma-l Schools where
the need is especially great. After
the Easter recess every student will
be invited to report on the succes's

obtained.
