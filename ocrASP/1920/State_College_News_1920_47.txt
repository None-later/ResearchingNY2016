CHEMISTRY CLUB

Chemistry Club was founded
December i3, ion, for the purpose

of fostering a spirit of chemical

research. All students in advanced
chemistry courses are eligible for
membership, and such students in
chemistry as present original

Adviser—William 0. Kennedy.
Although Chemistry Club is the

oldest organization in college, ad-

vanced age does not interfere with
its activities, scientiﬁc or social.

Meetings are held twice monthly,

when the students read papers rc—

latiug to chemical problems of in-
terest. The two most popular
events on the club calendar are the
annual initiation and dance in the
fall, and a picnic in the spring.

Last year, the picnic was held in

the woods at Castlclon, N. Y., after

the members had node a tour of
inspection through the plant of the

Fort Orange Paper Company.
The club colors are red and sil«

vcr, and are used in the club pin,

consisting of the naphthalene ring
and a retort.

Another evidence of " chemical
action " is the publication of the
“Hormone,” issued “every now
and then—mostly then," by a
board of editors chosen from the
upper classes. The paper is not
entirely of a scientific character.
and either scientific or humorous
contributions are accepted from
members of the club.

NEWMAN CLUB

The Newman Club of State Col-
lege is one of a chain of Catholic
clubs oyei- the land in nearly every
big university and college where
Catholic studcnts attend. The club
takes its name from John Henry
Newman. ii man whose courage of
great decision and passion for great
causes and mastery in great
thoughts have made him one of the
most striking ﬁgures of the nine-
teenth century. or of any century.
The purpose of the club is to pre-
serve in education and elsewhere
the principles and atmosphere of
Catholicism.

The Newman Club
founded in the fall of 1916 by
Father Dunncy, whose encourage-
ment and sympathetic assistance
are a most important factor in

here was

 

making the club successful. The
Newman organizations of the vari-
ous colleges throughout the staic
have been grouped into provinces
by the clutcr-Nationnl Association,
each province with a particular
club as leader. The Newman Club
of State College has bccii chosen
leader of file Eastern New or]:
Province—this includes Syracuse
Universityu lCorncll, Runsscluci‘
Polytechnic Institute and Colgate.

A desire to preserve Catholic
principles and a Catholic atmos—
phccr has led to Quarterly Corpo—
rate Communious. The social ac—
tivities of the year have includ
reception of freshmen in associa-
tion with V. C. 1\.; bikes, and
a sleighridc and dance. The
monthly meetings have been un<
usually interesting, due to the iiii~
tiring efforts of the social commit-
tcc which has planned most enter-
taining programs.

The officers for 1919-1920 are:
President, (icorgc Scliiavonc, '20;
vice-president, Mary Patterson, '20;
secretary, Laura McCarthy, ‘21;
treasurer, Katharine Wunsboi‘o, ‘21;
reporter, Martha Parry, ’22.

"Flu: Newman Alumni have rc-
ceirtly been organized by Catherine
Fitzgerald, 'ii‘, cx~prcsidcnt oi
Newman. This body has a large
and an enthusiastic membership.
It pleasantly entertained the club
at a dance held in the Viiiccntinii
Institute in January. The club is
most fortunate in having this or-
ganization to aid in its activities.

The Newman Club of State Col—
lege is affiliated with Catholic clubs
in the various other leading col-
leges not only of the United States
but also of foreign countries in«
cluding Auckland, New Zcillﬁllii,
Cambridge University; Cambridge;
Edinburgh University, Edinburgh;
McGill University, Montreal; Mel-
bourne University, Australia; and
Oxford University, Oxford.

   

CANTERBURY CLUB

During the three years of its ex—
istence, Canterbury Club has shown
itself active in its threefold pur-
pose: Socizibility. spirituality, and
service. Dr. Creighton R. Storey
of St. Andrew's Episcopal church
has been the energetic and inspir-
ing adviser of the society. All
Episcopalians are urged to join. At
present we number about ﬁfty
members. The meetings have been
made interesting by speakers of
note on topics of ciiurch and public
concern.

Oiliccrs for the year are: Presi-
dent, Dorothy Banner: vice~prcsi~
dent, Mary Whish; secretary,
Charlotte Lynch; treasurer, Mary
Stripling; roportcr, Elisabeth Malta

SORORITIES AND
FRATERNITIES

State Colcge has seven sororities
and three fraternities, for the pro-
motion of good fellowship and
friendship. They contribute to the
social life of the college; the sorori-
tics by holding an animal lutcr~
sorority Tea, an Intersorority Bull
in the spring and individual sorori-
ty dances, and the fraternities by
holding animal dances. The sorori-
ties furnish something of dormitory
life. since all but one maintain
houses where as many girls as are
able to do 50. live. The fraternities
gave up their houses on account
