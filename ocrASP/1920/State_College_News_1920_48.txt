as well as profit, to the members of
the club. Not only enjoyable kinds
of entertainment have been pro-

struetivc talks.

One new feature has been the
lise of Spanish proverbs in an-
swer to the roll call. Another
which has been very delightful is
the learning of Spanish songs.
Social meetings have also been in

of this kind was held in the early
part of the year. French and
Spanish clubs ioined together in
an evening meeting which was held
in the college auditorium. Alter

of tableaux, dances, and songs, rc-
frcsliments were served. Another

our clothes, can our food, sell our
merchandise, riin ottr elevators,
operate our telephones. and deliver
our papers are some of the topics
t‘iillsltlt‘l't‘ti at the monthly meet—

111 the gym.

initiations were in order, at the
last meeting. Whether a “good
time was enjoyed by all" is a
question one must ask the initiates.
Certainly the initiators enjoyed the
spectacle. If you ever have the
blues, get Shorty Hathorne to do a
pathetic dance for you. The blues
will vanish instantly.

Several social affairs besides the
regular routine worlc have been
planned. Rumors of week-end trips
up the Mohawk Valley and perhaps
to Indian Ladder have been ﬁlling
the air. Swimming parties for the
girls have already been established.

COLLEGE PUBLICATIONS

The students of the college sup-
port thrcc publications. Perhaps
of chief importance among these
is the " State College News,” a
copy of which is here represented.
The paper is published weekly
throughout the college year. It
aims to represent all of the inter-
ests and activities of college life.
It is distinctly a "news" publica-
tion.

The “Pedagogue” is the an~
nnat year book, published by the
Senior class. It contains a record
of the class history, the student
activities of the college as a whole,
and for the current year, and hum-
orous or satirical impressions of
college life. -

The third publication is the
“State College Quarterly.” This
magazine is plirely literary and ar-
tistic, containing the original work
of the students and faculty. The
"Quarterly" is a re-birth of the
“ Echo," a former monthly pubiicnv
lion, and is a decided improvement
over the " Echo." as well as a very
creditable publication. -

The Alumni Association now
maintains an alumni ublication, to
be known as the " lumni Quar-
terly." Three numbers have now
been issued and much credit iii due
the board of editors.
