ALBANY ITSELF

Albany, the oldest chartered city
in the United States and the sec-
ond oldest city in America, is of
interest to the newcomer chieﬂy
because of its being the capital of
New York, the Empire State of the
Union. However, apart from all
claim to interest in that point, Al-
bany is a histpric old Dutch city
which otters much of interest and
proﬁt to those coming to State
Collige. whatever the personal
tastes may be.

First of interest comes the State
capitol which gives to the student
an opportunity of seeing the prac-
tical workings of the State govern—
ment. The sessions of the legis~
lattirc are open to the students and
man of the discussions carried on
are intensely interesting.

he New York State Library, in
the Education Building, ranks
among the first twenty libraries in
the world. Here the student is
privileged to use one of the largest
of reference libraries in the coun—
try, the periodical room, the law,
medical and legislative libraries.
Besides this great library, the stud—
ent has access to the V. M. C A.
and Pruyn libraries and several of
the smaller libraries in other sec-
tions of the city. In connection

geological. mineral and botanical
collections which cannot be ex-
celled. The life size groups illus-

nations of the Iroquois Indians is
of-espccial interest.

and take keen pleasure in living
over and imagining the past, Al-
bany will delight you because of
its quaint traditions and historic
past. Although most of the quaint
old buildings have been displaced
hv more modern structures, a series
of bronze tablcts has fortunately
been erected to record the ancient
names of streets and locate old
landmarks. The old Schuyler
Mansion, at ﬁne historic residence,
which is famous for the hospitality
r of General Schuyler and wherein
the wedding of Miss Schuyler and
Alexander Hamilton was cele—
7 lirated.. has been preserved intact

past scenes and events on the part
V of the many people who have
visited it because of its connection
with the early settlement of Al-
hany. '

TRAINING OF TEACHERS

 

\The fundamental purpose of the
New York State College for Teach-
crs is to give the basis of scholar-
ship and special method now
deemed necessary for secondary
school teachers. Courses are ar-
ranged iu such a way that all stud-
cnts must lay a broad foundation
of informative and cultural studies
before they devote themselves to
specialization. The Scheme of
major and minor studies allows
thorough preparation in one sub-
ject or in several closely related
subjects. The courses in the The-
ory and Practice of Teaching cover
all high school studies and are fol—
lowed by practicc teaching in the
Milne High school. Each senior
student teaches his major subject
during a period of twenty weeks.
This practice teaching is preceded
by observation of model lessons
given by the supervisors of practice
teaching, The student sees the
sucecssful application of correct
methods of teaching and has a
share in working out educational
experiments under actual high
school conditions.
