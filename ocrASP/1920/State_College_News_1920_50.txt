TEACHERS APPOINT-
MENTS COMMITTEE

Abram R. Brubacher, Ph.D.,
President, chairman; Herbert M.
Douglass, M. E., Ph.M., Professor
of Industrial Education; John M.
Sayles, A, B., d. B., Professor of
Secondary Education, Secretary;

arion S. Van Liew, .. Pro-
fessor of Home Economics; George
M. York, A. B.: Professor of Com-

mercial Education.

The purpose of this committee
is the adjustment of State College
graduates to suitable teaching po-
sitions. It aims also to bring to the

attention of school boards and

others employing teachers, prop-
erly prepared candidates for the

 

positions which they are seeking
to fill. While the college makes no
guarantee of position, no pains are
spared to secure acceptable and
rolnuuerative ones fer those who
graduate from its courses. '

During many years, the aim of

the committee has been succesr‘
fully carried out. Thereis greater
demand at present than alter before
for professionally trained teachers
and the Appointment Committee is
ready to_.serve by recommending
adequately prepared teachers.

 

. Social Activities

Last year the six sororities of
college banded together and gave a
ball Jointly instead of holding their
individual dances. This plan met
with such success that the same
scheme-is to be followed this year.
lutersorority Ball is to take place
in the lcu Eyck l'lotel, April 23.

The following are the committees
in charge:

Arrangements — Psi Gamma.

Dance Orders —— Delta Omega.

lx’clreshiuents — Kappa Delta.
invitations—~Alpha Epsilon Phi.
Taxi—Chi Sigma Theta.
Music— Eta Pill.

Soon after college opens, the
faculty gives a reception to the
student body but especially to the
freshmen. At this reception the
freshmen discover that instead of
severe, slcrn individuals they have
pictured the faculty are cordial
human beings. This reception is
followed by the Y. W. C A. recep-
tion which is a delightfully in-
formal occasion ill which the stud-
ents and newcomers get acquainted
ill the most novel ways. Newman
and Canterbury clubs give similar
receptions. All of these events take
place on Friday evenings and are
most pleasant ways in which to end
a wee .

The juniors wishing to start the
Freshman socially as well as along
other lines give a jolly Junior rc-
ceptiou ill their honor which is fol-
lowed on Saturday afternoon by a
Junior-Freshman sing. This sing is
followed by the various class sings,
the college sings in the auditorium
and last and finest of all, the college
campus sing on the night of Mov—
ing Up Day. ,

These informal events are fol—
lowed by lhe more formal class
week ends, each class having its
respective week elld.

The first is the Junior “’eek-
end which follows soon after the
mid‘ycar examinations. The Junior
festivities are opened on Thursday
night when the members of the
class give a reception to the faculty
in the college-gymnasium. Friday

 

night the Junior Prom—the big
event 01 the college year—is held
ill the ballroom or tile 'l‘cn Lika
hotel, the closing event of the
week is the " Junior Night ” at the
varsity basketball game. I

Sophomore Week-end comes ill
March. the festiVlLies include a
solree and a basketball game.

Senior Week comes lll Julie. 1t
15 at this time that the Senior Class
JJay, Alumni Day, Baccalaureate
Address, Commencement and the
Senior ball take place. Last year’s
Senior Hall which was held ill the
State Armory was a decided suc-
cess. As we celebrate the 75th an-
niversary of our Alma Mater this
June, special exercises are to be
held in connection with the celc~
bration.

Of course the Freshmen aren't
allowed to have a week-end, but
they are privileged to attend the
Y. M. ‘ A. and Y. W. C. A.
thanksgiving Hop.

These are but the big events of
the year, aild there al'c‘also several
minor ones. Lhicfcst of tllcsc are
the four “gym li‘olics” given by
the Cil‘ls' Athletic Association.
"Liym frolics" just can’t be ex-
plained, they simply have to be
experienced iii order to be appre-
ciated. Then on Saturday after-
noous during the months of Febru-
ary and March there are held what
is known as the informal “Satur-
day 'l'cas ” for the college students
at which facility women and wives
are the hostesses. These teas are
given ill the gymnasium from 3 to
5 o'clock, and dancing is ill ordcr.
Writing about dancing is a rc-
lninder that dancing always follows
the varsity games which are played
in the Albany High school gym-
nasium.

The sororities and fraternities

make merry during the year. Early .

in tile fall the sorority girls give
an llllchOl'Ul‘ll'y tea to which they
invite the faculty and students.
Soon after this ruslhparties, re—
union week ends. banquets and a
formal Intersorority hall and like—
wisde formal intcrfratcruity ball are
iel .

THE MILNE HIGH
SCHOOL

 

One of the largest and most im-
‘portant parts of State College is the
Milne High School, which is
housed on the third floor of the
main building. This school is a
model practice school ill which
seniors of the college do prac-
tice teaching for at least one semes-
ter.

The model school gives a two-
year junior high school course fol-
lowed by a regular four-year Re-
gents high school course. The
faculty of the school consists of its
principal, John 1. Sayles, several
critics or supervisors of practice
teaching—Miss Charlotte Loeb.
Miss Elizabeth Shaver, Miss Lydia
Johnson, Miss Jane Jones, Miss
Smith. Mr. James AleXander,“ and
Mr. Edward Long—~and the fifty
or more seniors who are practice
teaching. '

Physical education, athletics.

 

recreation and social activities are'
stressed ill the school. The latest
methods ill teaching are applied

with great success.

The standard of Millie High
school is very high. Each year a
number of State scholarships given
to Albany county are won by its
graduates, in competition with

those of several large high schools ‘ "

in the county. Oral credit is well-
to the‘ school, and the Englisl de- ,
purluient is certified, so that credit
is‘givcn to each student for litera- r
lure read. and he is required to
answer only the grammar and colli-
position divisions of tllc-Regcnts’
examinations.

lll addition to giving Seniors an
opportunity for doing practical
work in the teaching profession be-
fore leaving college, the school
offers a splendid opportunity for
making up entrance conditions. It
is a “ prep” scllool for any college,
and is an ideal “prep” school to
attend before entering State Col-
lege.

COLLEGE HONORS

 

The regulations governing the
system of College Honors appear
in the College Catalog and read as
follows: The Faculty shall dcs~
igulltc fur honors each year
those students of the Senior class
completing the requirements for
graduation who have maintained
notably high standing iii their
studies.

” Method of Designation. In de-
termining- the number of students
to be designated for honors, the
registrar shall compute the stand-
ing of each eligible candidate by
counting a, points for every scmes~
lcr hour ill which he secures credit
with a grade of A, 3 points for B,
3 for C, and l for D; and shall
then divide the total number of
points thus secured by the total
number of semester hours included
in the. calculation. Only those
candidates who attain an average
standing upon this basis of at least
3:50 shall be designated for honors.

“Anuouncemcht. The names of
all honor students, ill alphabetical
order, shall be printed upon the
commencement program and in the
College catalogue each year.’
