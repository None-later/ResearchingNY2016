PRACTICE HOUSE

In i9i6 the Home Economics De-
partment started a new phase of
work in the form of a Practice
House. The ﬁrst house was lo-
cated at 429 Washington Avenue,
but since 1918 it has been at 45
South Lake Avenue.

The aim of the Practice House is
to provide a Working home for the
seniors, a place in which the may
obtain practical ex erience in the
management of a 0115:, in plan-
ning and cooking of meals, and in
the ordering of supplies and super-
vision of household duties.

The house is under the direction
of Miss Eva Wilson. a member of
the Home Economics faculty. For
four weeks out of the senior year
groups of from four to ﬁve seniors
occupy the house. thus obtaining
their practical experience.

SYDDUM HALL

 

Syddum Hall was the first iris‘
dormitory started at State Co iege.
it was founded by iss Marion
Syddum Van Liew, of the Home
Economics Department, in the year
'0").
Avenue. it is a large house and
accommodates twenty-two girls.
The bedrooms are large and airy
and well equipped. Its living room
boasts of a cozy ﬁreplace and com-
fortable davenport.

Social activities are often held at
the Hall and are chaperoned by
Miss Steele. the house mother. She
looks after the social welfare of
the girls and affords for them some
very goo times. The girls them-
selves often have "bedroom lunches
sub was." and many other things
which one "reads about."

But the best part of Syddiim is
that it gives the girls a better ad-
vantage to ct out of college all
the college life available. There iS
class rivalry, and frosh-soph strifcs
and struggles often take place. it
allows the new girls to become ac-
quainted with a number of the col-
legc students more quickly than if
they boarded alone.

Syddnm, in our language, is a
great place, and we hope she will,
for a long time to come, be the
same as she is to-day. Long live
Syddiiinl

ATHLETIC COUNCIL

The Athletic Council was found-
cd in the spring of 1917 for the
purpose. primarily, of taking charge
of State College athletics; but, since
there was not at that time any
provision for the handling of the
student finances, it also took charge
of that. Board of Finnnce.how-
ever. has been established since that
time, and the Athletic Council can
now devote its whole effort to
athletics.

in the brief time of its existence
the Council has done remarkable
Work. The ﬁrst year by its care—
.l'ui supervision it insured the suc-
Cons of the student tax; and by its
c icient dealings with athletics it
has put State College on the inter-
collegiate map. its prompt atten—
tion In all important matters, and
