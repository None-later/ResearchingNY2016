DRAMATIC AN‘D ART
ASSOCIATION

The Dramatics and Art Associa-
tion was founded in 1919 for the
purpose of. arousing a greater in-

terest in dlramatics and the ﬁne arts_

and 'of giving the students more ad-

vantages in~both these ﬁelds. It‘

wasthought that the college dra-
matics'class. already highly suc-
cessful. could accomplish still more
ambitious projects if backed by an
organized support; that the depart-
ments both of dramatics and of fine
arts could be augmented with ice-
tures on dramatic and art subjects
and with exhibitions and other atl-
vantagcs not attainable save
through an associated body of stu—
dents interested in‘ these things;
and ﬁnally. that a more complete
correlation of the two kindred in-
terests would be brought about by
their union in a single organization.
it was with these ends in mind that
the Drainatics and Art Association
was founded.

The payment of the student tax
automatically makes each student
a member of the Association. Thus
it includes practically the entire
student body and insures to every
one an equal share in the beneﬁts
derived. The Association is
ﬁnanced by an appropriation from
the student tax fund. Whereas in
former years all plays, lectures, etc.,
were ﬁnanced independently and
required the payment of an admis-
sion fee by each student who at-
tended them. the student tax card
is now the ticket of admission to
the college plays. to the art and
dramatic lectures, and to all events
and functions supported by the As-
sociation. It is a far more econom-
ical. more convenient. and more
efficient means of securing to the
entire student body the enjoyment
of these functions.

The control of the Association
rests with the Dramatic and Art
Council of nine members. Toward
the close of the second semester.
two students are elected from each
of the thrce‘uppcr classes to mem—
bership in the Council for the en-
suing year—one member from each
class representing the dramatic in-
terest, the other the art interest.
in addition to these six students.
the Council contains three faculty
members—the head of the dramat—
ics department. the head of the art
department, and one other faculty
member appointed by the President
of the college. The Council elects
its own ofﬁcers—president, secre—
tary. and treasurer—at the begin—
ning of the ﬁrst semester. It makes
its own laws and transacts all the
business of the Association.

This, the ﬁrst year of the Dra-
matic and Art Association. has
proved the practicability of the pro-
ject. The support of the college
plays has increased; interest has
doubled in all dramatic and art af-
fairs givcn'in the college. The
students have had the opportunity
to hear lectures unequalled in_ their
particular spheres—Dr. David 
Robinson, of Johns Hopkins Uni-

riversitv. the eminent archeologist.

and Clayton Hamilton, the fore-
most dramatic critic in America.
Other attractions are rapidly being
planned. under the encouragement
of this 'year’s success. It is hoped
that next year will ﬁnd interest
even more alive. that more and
more noteworthy events will be
brought about. and that a few sea~
sons will ﬁnd State.Colle'ge the
center of dramatic and art interest
.not only in Albany but in the whole
community.

 

INTER-CLASS DEBATES

This year a new phase of inter-
class rivalry is taking lace in the
form of inter-class ~ e ates. The
ﬁrst one took place in Student As-
sembly. March 5. ‘The freshmen
won this debate, the topic being.
“Should the United States Own and
Control its. Coal Mines?” and their
Speakers. Agnes Smith. Helen Mc-
lx’enua. and Elizabeth Renn'cr, fa—
vored the afﬁrmative. The junior
members speaking for the negative
were .lamcs Biicci, Marjorie Potter.
and Nellie Parkhurst. The judges
were Dr. Hopkins, Dr. Creighton
Storey and Mr. 'Hidlcy.

The second of the series took
place in Student ASSembly. March
12, when the sophomores lost to
the seniors. their topic being
“Should Congress Prohibit Injunc—
tions Against Strikes?” The sen—
iors favored the afﬁrmative and the
speakers were Sarah Roody, Louise
Van i‘orstrand. and George Scliia-
voue. The sophomore speakers
were .lsadorc Bi'eslau. Clara Belle
Knickerbocker. and Eunice Rice.
Dr. liriibacher, Dean Homer, and
Miss Jones were the judges.

The final contest will he held
some evening in the near future in
the College Auditorium, when the
freshmen and seniors will debate,
the topic of which has not yet been
decided.

This phase of rivalry is one of
the cleanest. most constructive im-
aginable. and we hope to hear many
more debates as lively as these two
have been. v

THE COLLEGE
ORCHESTRA

 

The college orchestra was started
in the latter part of February’of
this year. Rehearsals have been
held regularly on \Vcdncsday cven~
ings (!\'(‘.l‘ since. and probably it
will not he a very long time before
it will be ready in play in public.

Dr, Thompson. a professor in the
English department and choir-
inaslcr and organist at tile First
Presbyterian Church of the city, is
acting as director. He has had ex—
perience along this line and is ex-
cellent help in giving the ﬁrst col-
lege orchestra its start.

Caslella fines is the Chairman of
the organization: Eunice Rice. Sec-
retary, and Myfanwy Williams,
Treasurer. The number of meni-
bers is about eighteen. The in-
struments making up the orchestra
are ﬁrst and second violins. ﬁrst
and second mandolins. guitars. and
a ﬂute. together with the piano, it
is honed that other instruments can
he added later.

if each member takes it upon
himself to be present at each re—
hearsal and to do his best to help
the cause along, there is no reason
why a college orchestra should not
become a permanent organization.

The members are as follows:
First violins. Caslella i‘iecs. Grace
Aronowitz: second violins. Herman
Stanb. Katherine McGarra’han; ﬁrst
mandolin. Alida Curry. Lela Cack-
encr. Dorothy Mulhollanrl: second
mandolin. Marion Vosbiirrrh. Bern
trier: Ci'isﬁelrl. Marian Benedict;
niiitar. Eunice Rice. Gladys Lodge.
Amics Underwood: ﬂute. Castel—
lnnn: piano. Katherine Ball. Dorm
thy Dang-remand. Louise Persons.

JUNIOR SISTERS

The entering class each year is
fortunate in the greeting tendered
them by the juniors. In the sum-
mer preceding the coming of the
freshmen each iurrior writes to a
prospective student. and offers as“

 

sistance in any way'possible—such
as securing a boarding place, me’c’t-
ing the new student at the train.
etc. Later the juniorsvacquaint the

freshmen with the points of interest

about the college and the city. and
act as general guardians until the
freshmen become acclimated.

FINE ARTS DEPARTMENT

 

The Art Department, in addition
to providing an opportunity for
those who like to specialize in [the
work. offers a number of courses
which make a good background for
maior work in history of ancient
and nicdiaeval art, both in Europe
and in this country. The latter has
been a new feature this year. bring-
ing the realization to the students
privileged to hear the lectures that
America has a real aboriginal art
history. Then. modern art has
been studied with a view to under<
standing the new movements. such
as Cubism. Futurism. Synclironism.
etc. In this connection. the work
and lives of later artists have been
presented. The annual trip -to New
York to study the exhibitions and
places of artistic interest has been
postponed until after Easter. when
a group of students expect to spend
a part of the holidays instead of
taking the time during the regular
session of second semester.

The class in methods is one of
the most practical in college. for it
is run parallel to the actual practice
teaching in drawing. thus making
the lectures and examples very con—
crete. Each year the class takes
up some new form of handwork
which is being used in the schools.
Last year the special problem was
booked-rug-making; this year it is
the study of batik work and other
methods of hand-dyeing.

Thethree remaining classes are
technical in nature, in which the
student has a chance to perfect
himself in design and representa-
tion. and to learn the use of various
mediums. such as pencil sketching,
pen and ink. charcoal. and water
color. Here. also. there has been a
chance to turn theory into practice.

 

for many of the problems httve been
posters for Americanintlon work.
and other activities. . ’

The purpose of the department ll
to train teachers for supervisln '
work in the grades and-_ in big
schools, success of which is shown
by the great demand for such teach-
ers year after year.

Questions
Where did Flo Stuhbs' lunch go
to the other day?
Wli is Mary Grahn a rotundity?
(Perp excd frosh.)
if we wade in water long enough
will nature provide us with ﬁns?

W'ly did M'iss Murray flunk a
theme entitled "Jerry, Our Old
Horse"

W‘hat's Adalcne Hall mean by
going around saying. "Oh, isn't it‘
lovely and grand." "Oh, I'm per-
fectly thr-r-illed, aren’t you?"
Wherc'd she get that stuﬁ. huh?“_

 

A frOsh writes to
friend back home: ‘. .
when anyone asks what is going on
Friday morninv all you do is yell
‘Oli. llcll.’ an they get you. Of
course. Flossie. dear. that isn't
meant to be swearing, for you see

her bosom

it's like this. . .

 

Echoes

What’ll I‘ write a theme about?
Qh. please give me a topic for a
theme.

Why. I don't see what she got
mad at that for.

Makc it interesting.

These marks are hideous.

If you were boys I’d curse you.

Your approach is wrong.

How'd' I know? Why. I’m tak-

The mathematical mind can't ap-
preciate poetry. Once a mathema-
tician who began Tenn son's stir-
ring “Half a league. but a league.
half a league—" put down the vol-
ume. contemptuously muttering:

f the idiot means a league and
a half why can’t he say so?”

 

A certain woman's husband was
going to sea. so she asked the min-
ister to read this announcement:

‘ man going to sea, his wife
desires the congregation: to offer
prayers."

“This is the way the notice was
read: "A man going to see his wife,
desires the.congregation to offer
prayers."
