Inous'rn’isli DEPART- .
MENT

The Industrial Department ofl‘cr‘s
two courses in industrial training,
a two—year course and a four-year
course. 1\.candidate for the two~
year course must have had 'three
years of high school work or its
equivalent. in two years llCVWlll
receive instruction in all lines of
work necessary to prepare him to
teach in any industrial school. This
training includes wood working,
machine sllop practice, plumbing,
mechanical drawing, forging,
moulding, pattern making, history
and principles of education, and a
course in methods 'and practice
teaching. On the successful com-
pletion of this course a life certiﬁ-
cate to teach industrial subjects is
granted. r .

’l‘he four-year course lllciuthS the
subjects named above, with the ad-
dition of a minor in some other
subject. The industrial student
usually minors in physics, chem-
istry, mathematics, or physical ed-
ucation. Upon the completion of
this course the student is given a
B. 5. degree and a life certiﬁcate to
teach industrial subjects and such
other subjects as he may he quali-
lied to teach.

The department is now training
three men for the Federal Board of
Vocational Education which has
charge of placing every wounded
soldier in new training,

Men are going out from this de<
partnieut this year with salaries
ranging from $l,5oo to $i,800.

There is a possibility of the In-
duslrial Department being trans-
ferred to the Buffalo State Normal
this fall, in which case only a gcn~
eral industrial course will be given

in connection with other four—year.

courses. The aim of such a general
course would he to acquaint pros-
pective high school principals with
the different phases of vocational
work.

HOME ECONOMICS DE-
PARTMENT

 

The Home Economics Depart-
ment was established at State Col—
lege in September, 1910. As ﬁrst
given the course was completed in
one year. Since then it has ex-
panded and improved, now covcr~
ing four years and granting a
Bachelor of Science degree.

The course in clothing includes
plain sewing, dressmaking, textiles,
handiwork, millincry, costume de—
sign and history of costume. house
planning and decoration. These
subjects are closely correlated with
the art department. ,

The courses given in foods con-
sist of selection, preparation and
service of food, microbiology, die-
tetics and nutrition, This work is
correlated with the science depart-
ment.

’.he Practice House operated in
connection with the department is
now four years old. The seniors
live here, in small groups, for one
month, two weeks each semester.

While living here they organize

and conduct all household activities.

his work is under supervision of
one of the teachers of the depart—
ment and is a general summarizing
of their classroom work.

A college cafeteria has recently
been added to the equipment of the
department, rvThis has a two-fold
purpose—to ‘provide a practical
outlet for cookery class products
and practice in, lunch» room man-
agement,.,and to provide good and

. economical meals for college stu-

 

 

 

dents. The equipment is being con-
stantly enlarged to meet the needs
of the cafeteria. . I

Another new project is the es-
tablishment of a dressmaking shop,
which is used as a laboratory for

tile dressmaking and costume de-'

sign classes. It is well equipped
with foot and power machines, cut-

ting and work tables and a ﬁtting'

room. All types of work are done
for children andadults, from alter-
ation and remodeling to the con-
struction of new garments.

About a ﬁfteen-minute walk,
across the park from college, is the
H E. dormitory, Syddum Hall,
housing twenty~ﬁvc girls. The
house is under the direct super-
vision of the department, one of
the faculty livin with the girls as
house mother. "he house is large,
airy and comfortable, with a living
room which affords an opportunity
for social gatherings of ,various
kinds. This dormitory was the
ﬁrst to be set up in connection with
college and has proved a decided
success.

Although the purpose of the de-

partment is to train teachers, it

places its graduates- in many other
ﬁelds of work. Laboratory and
hospital work, cafeteria and lunch-
room management, designing and
dress-shop work are some lines in
which graduates have been success-

THE JOB OF THE'UNI-
VERSITY

 

What does it mean to go to a
college or a university? What ad-
vantage does higher education
offer? You spend four of yourbcst
years at an institution of learning.
You subtract four years from your
active business career. on give
your fellows in high schooh who
will be your competitors, perhaps,
in after life, a four years' handicap.
is it worth while?

Really, the answer rests with the
individual. The “college man" has
been madc.the subject for, per-
haps, as many jokes as the prover-
bial “mother-in-law." And proba-
bly he deserves this attention of
the jokesmiths just about as much.
You can go to college and waste
four perfectly good years of your
life, graduating with a diploma that
means absolutely nothing but wast-
ed time and cash. r you can go
to college and come out standing
head and shoulders in intellect and
resourcefulness above your friends
who have not enjoyed this advan—
tage. it's up to the man.

hat college or university train—
ing is desirable, is proven pretty
conclusively by the universal con-
sent of people everywhere. Par-
ents will make untold sacriﬁces to
send their children to college. Am-
bitious young men will spend four

.years of the hardest kind of work——

washing dishes, waiting at tables,
selling magazine subscriptions, do-
ing whatever comes to their hands
———for the purpose of paying their
wav through college.

A practical question which every
prospective student at the higher
educational institutions must decide
for himself is whether to go to the
“small college" or the "big univer—
sity." Both have advantages pecu-
liar to themselves. on go to a
university. and are one of, perhaps.
several thousnnd students—a huge
army of young men, representing
every condition of society. every
degree of moral and mental devel~
opment. every possible outlook
upon life and what it offers. The
university's cosmopolitan quality is
one of its evident advantages, It
surely helps a man to rub off the

‘sity as he would in any walk of

life. If he has qualities of leader-
ship ‘he can taste in advance in a
very real way the joys of success.

On the other hand, the student in
the university is left very much to
his_ own devices. He may sink or
swim, and no one much cares. ex-
cept his immediate friends and the
folks back home. here classes
are large it is difﬁcult to give each
student strictly individual attention.
Much must be left to assistant pro~
fcssors, qtnz masters, etc. If a man
wants to study, he has the best of
masters. If he wants to loaf, he
can do so without causing much
comment.

On the other hand, the smaller-

college offers inducements which
are lll their degree unique. Un-
doubtedly 'for college spirit you
must go to the small college. For
the unity of thought and action that
does mue‘h to form and inspire the
minds of young students you may
well go to the small college. For
Indivtdual attention to students the
small college often can justly claim
an advantage over its larger and
more powerful rival. And for the
atmosphere of hard, concentrated
study, the small college often is

 

superior. That is natural enough,
of course. Where classes are small
attention is focusscd 0n the indi-
vidual. He will know every one of
his classmates, probably by their
lirst names. He is interested in
them, and they in him. If he falls
down on a recitation everybody
knows it and comments on it. And
it ‘happens, too, that professors of
astonishingly adequate qualiﬁca-
tions for their work are found in
comparatively obscure colleges.
The matter of the branch to be
studied must, of course, be a factor
in determining where to go. The
university offers to teach practically
every branch known to science or
letters. There are, however, col-
leges which devote themselves en-
tirely to the teaching of one of the
branches of science—colleges of en‘
ginccring or medicine, for instance.
The big job of the university, in
the ﬁnal analysis. is not so much to
turn out men who are skilled in
their chosen lines, whether that
line he classics, or advanced busi—
ness, or one of the professions—as
it is to educate men up to their
chosen life work; to make out of
them men of broad minds, ready
sympathies, quick and incisive
grasp, men qualiﬁed for leadership.
