DEPARTMENT

, __

To the young man or woman
looking forward to teaching as
their life work, the commercial de-
partment in our college offers un-
usual opportunitics. Since its or-
ganization some six years ago the
demand for its graduates has
greatly exceeded the supply. Sec-
ondary school superintendents and
principals are constantly asking for
college trained commercial teachers
with the result that many of the
most lucrative positions in the high
schools of the state are to be had
by teachers qualifying in this ﬁeld
of education.

The course in Commercial'Ed-
ucation consists of elementary and
advanced accounting, commercial
geography, commercial law, ele—
mentary statistics, economics,
money and banking, stenography
and typewriting. Pupils complet-
ing this course are able not only
to teach, but are qualified to hold
positions in commercial and secre-
tarial work in the business ofﬁce.
The courses in accounting are de—
signed to prepare for courses that
qualify for examinations in the
ﬁeld of higher accountancy.

A student may also elect a
minor in this department, either
along the lines of accounting or
stcnography. The first choice cou~
sists of elementary and advanced
accounting. commercial geography,
law, elementary statistics and
methods; the second choice con-
sists of elementary and advanced
stcnography, commercial geogra-
phy, commercial law and methods.

in addition to the regular col~
lcge work, ample opportunity is
offered for practical application of
business principles in the business
ofﬁce of the college and thc Milne
High School.‘ The work in the
business ofﬁce is most helpful, as
actual ofﬁce conditions and prob-
lems are met with and solved. in
the Milne High School, classes in
bookkeeping, typewriting and sten-
ography afford the practice teacher
the necessary experience in teach-
ing commercial subjects.

able pictures and slides will be

tory service,

A Sure Thing
The workman was digging. The
wayfarer of the inquisitive turn of
mind stopped for a moment to look

on.

"My mart," said the wayfarer at
length, “what are you digging for?"

The workman look up. "Money,"
he replied.

"Moneyl'i ejaculated the amazed
Wayfarer. "And when do you ex—
pect to strike it?”

“On Saturday,” replied the work—
man, as he resumed operations.

 

"There Was a Little Girl”
There was a little girl who had a

it c cur
Right in the middle of her forc-
lcﬂt,
And when she was good, she was
very, very goat,
But when shewas bad she was
horrid.

She stood on her head, on her little
trundle bed.

With nobody by for to hinder;
She screamed and she squalled, she
yelled and she hawled,

And drummed her little heels on
the winder.

Her mother heard the noise, and
thought it was the boys
Playing in the empty attic. ,
She rushed upstairs, and caught her
nnawarcs, '
And spunde her most emphatic.

 

The trolley was terribly crowded,
as trolleys will he. The passengers
were literally sandwiched in.
stout woman tried vainly to get
her fare out of her pocket, which
she had lightly buttoned as a pre‘
caution against pickpoclcets. For
several moments she worked at the
buttons, and then the man next to
her said: “Allow me to pay your
fare. madam,"

"No, thank you," was the reply;
and once more she began at the
buttons on the pocket.

After a while the male passenger
once more asked: "Won't you al-
low me to pay your fare, madam?"

“Certainly not," was the acrid
reply’; “I have my {are if i can get
at it. '

"i, only suggested it, madam,"
was the quiet reply. “because you
have already unbutt‘oned my sns-

penders three times.

 

"Did you ever see a dog cry?"
“No, but i have seen a moth-
hull."

Gone But Not Forgotten

“Arc caterpillars good to eat?"
asked little Tommy at the dinner
table.

“No,” said his father; "what
makes you ask a question like that
while we are eating."

"You had one on your lettuce,
but it's gone now," replied Tommy.

 

The Limit >

A New England housewife was
so painfully neat that she made life
miserable for her family. One of
her rules was that all members of
the household must remove their
shoes before entering the house.

“Bill,” she said one day to her
husband, "I found a grease spot on
one of the dining—room chairs, and
I think it came off those pants you
wear in the shop,”

A brief silence ensued. then a
volcanic eruption: “Well, irandy,
for the last ﬁfteen years I have
taken off my shoes every time I
come into the house, but I’ll be
hanged if I’ll go further."

 

Housewife—"If you love work,
why don't you ﬁnd it?"

Tramp (sadly)—“Alas, lady, love
is blind."

rs. Dimpleton—"Best I over

lelng It I' Name
Bacon—"When a thing is bread-
ed, what do you call t?‘
Egbert-“What sort of a thing?”
"Meat, for instance."
“Well, when meat is breaded I’d
say it was a sandwich."

 

The Eternal Masculine
"Mamma, why's papa no hair?”
"Because he thinks so much, my

dear.”
"But why have you so much?"
"Because:ng away and do your
lessons. you naughty boy "

 

Laying Down the Law
The young wife regarded the
breakfast table with a critical eye.
“Phyllis,” she said, sternly, to
her handnmiden, "how often have I
told you that when you lay eggs
you must lay spoons tool"

Wei—"Are you a Latin scholar?"
Frosh-"No, Iris‘h.”

 

"So you want to be my son-in—
iaw, do you?” asked the man. with
as much iicrccncss as he could as-
sumo.

"\Veli,” said the young man, "I
dolt‘t particularly want to, but 'i
suppose [ shall have to if I marry
your daughter."

A young man, while writing some
letters. happened to mix up two.
ilis washcrwoman received a note
asking hm- to accompany him on
an auto ride the next day. llis best
girl t'cct‘ivcd the following: “Say,
it you don‘t stop massing up my
shirt fronis l'll leave you."

 

“How many kings will be left in
ten years from now, do you think?"
asked an American.

“Five.” replied the Britishcr.

“Five? Which "

“The King of Hearts, the King
of Spades, the King of Clubs, the
King of Diamonds, and King
George."

 

Junior—“Why did they build the
right hand on the Statue of Liberty
clevcn inches wide ’

Sop'h—"Haven‘t the
idea."

Junior~“Why, because if they
built it another inch it would have
been a foot.”

Farmer—“Do you guarantee this
clover seed?" .

Merci)ani-—"Guarantecl My dear
sir, if that seed doesn’t come up
you bring it back, and I'll repay
your money.”

 

Mrs. Wickwirc—"if a woman
were given the credit site deserves,
i don't think men would he so
prominent in the world’s history."

Mr. \Vickwire—“I guess you’re
right. if she could get all the
credit she wants he‘d be in the poor
house."

Mrs. :\.—“You say you kept a

cook for a whole mont . How in
the world did vou manage it?"

Mrs. B—"We were cruising on
a house-boat and she couldn’t
