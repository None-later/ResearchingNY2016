BILLS BEFORE LEGIS-
LATURE

Important Clause Included

Lockwood amendments to the
teachers’ salaries' bills, which are
before the Legislature now, will
provide an appropriation by the
State of about twenty millions in

villages anti districts of from two
hundred, to three to six hundred
dollars, according to the size of the
municipality.

The amendments also specify
minimum salaries and will carry a

dents, and it will also make it pos-
