THE OVERALLS MOVE-
MENT

Overalls have taken the country
by storm, The vogue has spread
rapidly until it has invaded not
only the city street but the business
office, the school, the court, and
even Congress and the pulpit, and
with the popular spread of the
movement, there has come much
talk in regard to it.

Governor llickett of North (Taro~
lina in rejecting an invitation to
join an overalls club denounced
the movement saying: “There is
no good in it. it will run the
price of overalls up to a tigure that
cannot be paid by those who of
necessity must wear them. i think
that the members of such a chib
ought to agree not to buy an auto-
mobile until prices have dropper]
twenty-live per cent. So long as
people are willing to pay any price
for the things they want and are
not Willng to practice sclhdcnial.
all talk about cutting down the
high cost of living is gobble.”

if everybody adopts the idea
after the manner of a certain
Billy Rose who, according to the
“New ork Tribune,” paraded
down Michigan Avenue, Chicago,
in trousers and juniper of blue
denim. but with a two dollar silk
handkerchief peepingr from a
pocket, a twenty dollar silk shirt
visible above the rolled back collar,
and a ﬁfteen dollar hat on his head,
we cannot help agreeing with Gov-
ernor Bickctt. ' rented in this
manner the movement becomes a
foolish fad which can bring harm,
but no possible good,

But on the other hand, if this
movement is treated in, what the
“ New York Tribune” calls the
“overalls spirit." then we feel that
the movement should be heartily
indorscd.

The “Tribune” in an editorial
says: “Overalls are not only
cheap and economical clothes; they
are a perfect symbol of just the
sort of economizing and thrifty iii-
dependence that cvcry American,
young and old. ought to learn—-
the sooner the better.”

And farther on it adds: “ Now,
for various reasons it is highly im-
portant. that we should get a new
paint of View. We need to realize

luxury or waste, and that all We
really iiecd,,to be comfortable and
happy, is il far smaller and far
more simple equipment of clothes,
food, everything. Simplicity should
become fashionable—not as a fad,
a foolish affectation, but as the only
safe, sensible, and comfortable way
of living in the present state of
prices and strikes and taxes."

As future teachers it might be
well for State College students to
get the “overalls spirit,” not only
for their own good, btit to pass on
to the young Americans who will

,.

come under their guidance. 21.

TENNIS

\ ___...._.

 

\Vlicn spring comes. one begins
—almost at once—to think oi tcn~

his 'balls and racqucts and such
things. The department of phys-
ical education has done some

thinking along these lines, and it
has made some very definite plans
as well. Chief among these is a big
tennis lottrn(intent—possibly a
Moving-Up Day feature. An op-
portunity to sign up for this will
soon be given to all those who
wish to compete. The winner will
be awarded a silver cup. The dc-
partmcnt is also hoping most fer-
vently that some day some one or
ones at the State, Department of
Education will permit our lawns—a
little bit of them anyway—in be
cut up into tennis courts so we may
practice at home. Until this day
arrives. however, We must be con~
tent with the courts at \\'ushington
li'ark. These courts will be ready
for use by May 1, at the latest.
Everyone who can play tennis is
urged to sign up for this tourna-
ment which we must ma.er a bin
thing—and a great success. ")3
YOUR ATTENTION,
PLEASE

The following is a limiter in
which every student at. State Col—
lege should be interested and it is
for this reason that it is brought
to your attention.

As you all know State College
closed its basketball season sev»
oral wet-ks ago in wliirlwiitd
fashion, with splendid victories
over Manhattan at New York and
Hobart here. So far as we were all
concerned. the basketball season
was a thing of the past, but there
was another matter that has not
yet been settled which concerns the
men who had worked unseltishly
for us all winter to make the season
a successful one. it is in that con-
nection that this artich is written.
Rumor has it that the basketball
treasury at the ctid of the season is
empty. i hear some of you cx‘
claim: “W'ell, what's wrong if it
is empty? You didn't expect to
have a balance left over to buy
Pierce-Arrows for the players?"
Right you arc—we didn‘t expect it
—bnt if you will consult your mem-
nrics or brush up on State College
customs and precedent, you Will
discover that at the. end of the sea-
son the players who worked for
State and for you fvc nights a
week from October t the middle
of March receive. as a token of
their efforts in behalf of their col-
lege, their letter—a. purple S—in
close proximity to which is a
sweater. This, as you can verify
by consulting the proper ofﬁcial
records, has been the custom at our
college in past years.

Our proposition can now he
stated as follows: Have the men
who represented State College on
the court this year earned the cus-
tomary reward for such effort? if
so, how are we going to give it to

6. Importance of Careful Regis-

n
'1

a l

Each student should bear in mind
that he is registering for the Work
he is actually to pursue during the
your 1920-1921. Changes in sched—
ule will be permitted only in cases
affecting the welfare of the student,
and each case will be carefully
scrutinized by the Dean. Each
student is therefore urged to regis-
ter carefully, considering his own
comfort so far as possible. For
example:

1 A commuter should inform
himself about train accommoda-
tions, and take care not to register
for work at hours when he will be.
unable to be at college.

(b) A student who plans in an
gage in outsith work should con—
sidcr the hours that will be needed
for that employment and should
not register for college work at
those hours.

7. Read these directions care-
fully, observe the procedure out-
lined and thus help to reduce to a
minimum confusion and tiresome
waitini,r in line.
