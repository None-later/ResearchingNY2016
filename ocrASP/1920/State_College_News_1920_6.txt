Chemistry Club held its meeting
on January 9, James ltneri gave a
paper on rnhher. lie g'av: a short
history of it amt the countries
where it is found. When first dis-
covered no one had any use for it.
Sir Francis Drake saw the Indians
honncingr something. He took it
hack to England where they tf'ieti
to make cloth of it but were an-
successful. Priestly found that it
erased a pencil mark, hence the
name rtthher. its original name he-
ing catehue. Later England made
use of the material for
cloth, helm;r unarhlc to use it for the
cloth itself. Macintosh first dis—
covered this use ——hcncc the name
of ottr raincoats. it came to New
England with the pilgrims—who
found that in summer it became
soft and in winter hardened and
cracked, Goodvcar in playing with
it, tossed it accidently on the stove,
where to his surnrisc it hardened
into a mass. He thus became fain-
ous in the discovcrv of vulcani-

zation.

coal and ashes on the hank of a
small river. This was the State

was to get registcrcdp—‘a SCl‘itHIn

spend the afternoon in the line

The first meeting was most impres—

40 nations and 1.000 institutions.

In this generation." "The old
order has changed.” said Dr. Mott,
“and it is for the students to de-
termine what shall he the mould of
the new world." Every evening
there was a splendid meeting in the

The people of Des frtoiues Were
most cordial and hospitable audit
did us good to get the Western
point of view. New York is really
not nearly as important as Liln‘
cago! The western universities
have a spirit found nowhere in the
final. lint western cities are much
(litigier tlltttt our cities. for in all of
them they burn soft coal.

\‘VU'SltU‘tctl East again Sunday
night on the' lloston Special. We
spent most of Monday in Chicago
where we had a husy day sight-
seeing, The Union Stock Yards,
Marshall Field's, Moody Institute,
llnlt House and the University of
(hicago were the points of great-
est interest. Tuesday ultrning we
stopped altont fifteen minutes at
Niagara, Ontario, and had a
glimpse of the Horseshoe Falls,
the rapids of the Niagara and the
Whirlpool, The only thiui,r we
slept through was the. Mis, '
After hrief stops at lx'oe

glad to be back home and feeling
that the task of getting over to the
