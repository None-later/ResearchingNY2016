CLAYTON HAMILTON
TALKSUPON THE
THEATER

On Thursday night, March 18,
the Dramatic aml Art Asswcintinn
presented Mr. Clayton Hamilton,
who gave a talk on the economic
condition of the theater. i\lr.
Hamiltonywho has seen all the
noteworthy plays for the last
twanty years, said that a prosper~
oils theatrical season from the
standpoint of the box ofﬁce was
usually a poor season for the
drama. This year has been just
such a ﬁnancially prosperous time,
for people crowd the theatres rc-
gardless oi the plays that are
shown. People complain because
there are not enough scrious and
important plays produced. They
say that American authorship is at
fault; but they do not understand
the situation. For there are plenty
of important and serious plays
written; but they cannot produce
enough money weekly to stay in a
theater in New York. So the plays
that draw lhc crowds are given:
bedroom Infccs and “who killed
cock robin " pints. [For cvcn with
the price oi tbcalcr lirict-ts doublc'!
these plays can run indclinilcly.

Mr. I'Iamillon cxplniui'd hrirlly
‘thc aim and history of the theater
guild. To satisfy the desire that a
great many good people ham- to
see great and classic drama. a
number of artists, actors and (le—
signcrs organized a llleatcr guild
whose aim was to produce grunt
plays by great authors. The
thcatcr guild realizcd that its
greatest problcm was an economic
one, and made it [)nssihlc to save
money by ('limiualinlcr lhc Slam-
managcr. 1\ insincss manager
only was hired

Their ﬁrst great success was
“ John Ircrgusun," which has taken
its placc as a great play only
through the guild. So, in so tar
as it can, this organization has
solved for itsclf the cconomic
problems of the theater.

Mr. Hamilton named the best
plays now running in New York:
"Beyond the Horizon." “Mam-
ma’s Affair,” “Clarence.” “’l‘ht:
Famous Mrs. Fare," "Wedding
Bells," “ Abraham Lincoln,” “Jane
Glenn." Then Mr. Hamilton talked
delightfully of what makes plays
or any literature great. “The ma-
terial is not important,” said Mr.
Hamilton, "but the mind ol the
author through which the matc‘ial
passes."

Knowing the enormous drain on
the time and energy of the squad
while it was cnd‘cavoring to uphold
State’s reputation, and appreciat~
ing the sacriﬁces and restrictions
undergone by the men while doing
so. we cannot help but grant that
the customary reward has bct-n
earned by them in the full sense
of the word. ‘

That brings us to the question,
how can we perioan our duty on
an empty treasury? Several ways
suggest . themselvcs~wc might
have a tag day for this purpose;
or we might give a dance. the pro~
cccds of which could be applied as
above stated; or the autumn neccsv

it was appropriated.

In considering the ways here
suggested we can pass over tin.-

tax there should be no necessity for

this year we appropriated $l,lli)ll

seems that we owe thanks to lhc
management that We are as well off
