LECTURE SERIES ENDED

Father Slattery delivered the last
of the series of addresses on Dante
Friday morning. llis subject was
“Dante’s Paradise." This talk, as
well as those which have preceded,
gave an excellent review of the
poet's works The great amount of
preparation which has been neces-
sary to bring these lectures before
the students is duly appreciated.
During the. college year, when so
much time must he devoted to re-
quier work. one has little oppor-
tunity for gaining knowledge along
these lines. The talks have, in
part. furnished such an opportunity
attd in addition have stimulated a
greater'itttercst in Dante.
