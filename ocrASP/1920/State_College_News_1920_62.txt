MYSKANIA ELECTION

To-morrow morning in assembly
the Student llody will have a
hitherto unprecedented opportunity
to express its opinion in the elec—
tion of two members to next year‘s
Myskania. Ballots with places for
two names will be provided and no
ballot containing the same name
twice will he considered. This elec-
tion is a new phase of student rep-
resentation and careful thought
should be exercised by everyone in
his voting. Vote for the two people
whom you think most deserve this
honor, not the ones you're afraid
won‘t be appointed in any other
way. Show your appreciation to
those people who have State Cob
lcuc foremost in their minds as
evidenced by their activities in alh~
lctic, social, scholarship. religious
and other fields. lie fair to your
self and to the capable members of
the Junior class. The votes will
be collected by classes and statis-
tics kept in that way. The usual
method of announcng Myskania
members will be followed out on
Moving-Up Day, May 2 .

Previous to this election Profes-
sors Walker and llutehison will
discuss the Lusk bill now before
the Governor. preparatory to the
Student Body’s expression of its at-
titude towards this hill. Professor
Douglass will also speak.

To the Editor of the “News”:
Most of us have memories of
former Moving-Up Days when we
rushed around vainly tryinLr to see
everythimar on time. We had
classes in the morning. then the
Moving-Up Day ceremonies fob
lowed by class stunts. it was too
late for lunch at the boarding
houses so we not an ice cream cone
and went up to liidgeﬁcld. \Vc
got back in time for a hurried din-
ncr and then came to the sine.
Were we all in? T’ll say we were.
Now for a proposition. Why not
on this—«the biggest day of our
college year -— dispense with
classes? le beginning the care
monies at nine o'clock we would
have time for everything. Plans
are already under way for several
additional features this year. May
we have time to enjoy them?
SENTOR.

 

FAIR PLAY TO OUR MEN

In last week’s issue of the
"News," a matter was brought to
the attention of the student body
which was a surprise to many 0|
W. and which, at the same tune,
is of importance to our college. The
matter referred to is that of the
varsity basketball men not l‘CCCIV'
lug sweaters this year, as they
customarily do. The reason [or
the lack of fluids in the basketball
treasury is very evident after one
notes the tigures that were quoted
week. Our basketball appro
t ‘i tion was at least $400 too short,
Iignring on the proportiomltc basis
of last year's appropriation, and
those of other years. How we
came to make such an inadequate
appropriation this year, matters ltl—
He; the question is how are we go-
int)r to straighten the matter out
now?

Athletics has done much to put
State College on the tnnp——-and
basketball has bad the biggest share
in doing the trick. The labors or
our teams during past years have
been gladly rewarded at the cod
of the scasou-—do we want to go
down on record as having new
[cctcd our duty to the men who
worked so faithfully for us all win-
fer?

:\ very simple and logical method
out of the difﬁculty was suggested
last week—2t I‘cttpproprlttllun of
the necessary amount from items
in our budget where the amount
can be spared. There are items
which have a surplus——tnorc than
rice ‘3' to cover the basketball
deli llL . Such a suggestion,
therefore, could be carried out, on
a motion before the student body
on lfriday morning.

[(Cl. us show our gratitude and
loyalty to our boys by a unanimous
vote in favor of the necessary rc-
appropriation. Unless we do, we
shall be guilty of ingratitude of the
worst kind and the fate of basket
ball at State College will be scaled.

A PARABLE

Once upon a time in a city lar,
far away in ,lllinois. there lived a
man who could read. write and
cipher. licsides, he had some
knowledge of Greek conjugations,
Latin declensions. nem’oucs. axones,
and some Facts in history. He was
clothed very raggedly~baggy
trousers, run-down heels. ragged
cuffs, and his appearance was one
of deep dejection. By trade he was
a professor as you might have
guessed before this. For thirty
long y-ars. he had dispensed edu-
cation at Crabb University, Ka-
hoochec, ML, and yet he was unable
to line his stomach with a decent
meal.

On this anniversary of his thirty
years of service at the above-men-
tioned institution. we find him walk-
ing; along the main street of Ka»
hoochce with a springy step and
the air of one who has successfully
solved a long—insoluble problem——
he was on his way' to the poor-
bonse. r1\s he was about to ascend
the steps of the building whose in
mates have little concern about in-
come taxes and the high price of
liver and gasoline, a rough hand
struck his shoulder. a cheery voice
struck his ear, and he was whirled
about face to face with one of 'his
former students.

"Well, if it ain't my old friend.

 

Professor lma Sucker! You re:
member me, don't you? Jones or
the class of ‘Utl. Well, well, well!
it this isn’t a surprise. What are
you domg here—conducting ex-
tension courses? "

“ r-ycs,-— hereafter all I my
courses \Vlll extend entirely wlthm

buckcr, in a hollow voice. which
seemed to re-‘ucbu from some lll-
tcriur cavity within his bony frame.

" You don‘t say sol (ice! that's
too bad. Say, L’rof.. you was al-
ways good to mc~remctnbcr?—~
Iuinked me every y hr in l‘sycb.

of a pl‘ul. I re always been grate
ful to you for that.~and it scents
that fate has tnrmvu me in your
way to repay you. l'm a city con—
tractor now. and l'll get you a job
with a salary—not wages like
you've been gettiu'. all your life.

implements.
