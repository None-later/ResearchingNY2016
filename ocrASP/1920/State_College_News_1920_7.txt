the place for the next convention,
when they will try to outdo Theta

On the afternoon of January 2
Kappa .\'u Fraternity. meeting itt
convention in the auditorium. was
addressed by Dr, Brnbachcr. The
subject of Dr. Brnbaclter's dis-
course was “The Function of the
Fraternity in the New Educational
System," and the pertinence and
timeliness of the topic invested, it
with a personal quality which
brought every word home to the
assembled delegates. The audi-
ence, comprising students of all the
leading universities throughout the
t‘ttttntrv and 'gradnatcs in every
walk of life, unanimously agreed
that seldom had they heard a man
with such advanced ideas on the
great educational problem of
American Democracy.

ntutn of Words amt of time.

Dr. llruluteher said that the who '

cational system of Io-day cannot
endure for Its fundamentals are nt-

compatible with the ideals of dc~ I

tttncracy. It is lutilded on a
foundation of human weakness, of
schish desire. ’l‘n-day when a
high-school graduate comes to his
instructors for advice. he is tohl to
adopt that profession or trade
which will bring hint the greatest
tinaucial returns. the highest nta~
tcrial success. lie. is educated to
believe that his personal welfare
alone is to he considered, and that
his education is merely a tool
when-with he may secure Illinlll'
latte over his fellow man itt the
business of life. When he gradu—
ales froth college he is informed
that the world is at his feet to be
conquered or lost. according as he
is proiicient or unverscd in grasp-
ing the opportunities which all men
are constantly striving’ for.

Such ideas strike at the very
heart of democracy. whose plat—
form is built on altruism, brother-
hood, and love. Deutocracy de-
mands that every man think for his
own wclfarc. only after he has cott-
sitlcrud that of the State and his
it-llows. it requires not competi»
that and advantage but considct'ar
lion and generosity. .A\ democracy

educational syslettt may endure for
a year or for a century. but tltc
crash will conu- eventually for it
cannot go on indefinitely.

ing render vitally necessary radical

ble destruction, Any organization
