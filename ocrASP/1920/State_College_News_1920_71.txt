Hoover, as well as General Wood
and others (it the candidates, stands
:or a hudget system.

Itis attitude toward socialism is
sociologtieally sottud.’ lIe regards
it as a European theory of despair
caused hy caste attd economic
wrong. Our social organization is
entirely tlit'l‘rrent from that 0|
liurope, for We have a system of
open classes which is the h; is for
equality ol‘ opportunity. We need
not fear socialism. He has said:
“- (‘Ittpltatic cottolttsion is that
socialism as a philosophy of pos-
sihle human application is hank<
rttpt.

Ilc favored the League of Na‘
tious. though his own conception
of a league was far more simple
than that of We 'dent Wilson.

Mr. lloover has handled hig- jttltﬁ.
\Ve need a Iuan of good common
sense and learlessness as the head
of our nation for the next four
years, We should he glad that Mr,
Hoover will consider a nomination.
He is not looking for personal
honor; he does not care for party
politicswhe still wants to serve.
llis motto may well have hreu:
" l.ive pttre. speak true. right

wrong. follow the I;ing‘—~

Else, wherefore horn 1’"

;\ friend of Hoover's has sa l:
“ llooret has succeeded l)t'(“
would never touch an entt tsc

He has always wanted to do things:
III a new way. and he won't hother
with anything else. .\ml when he
is set to solve such a prohlem. he
inv‘ 'ahly comes hack witlt a plan
that scores little men to death he
