Friday
part.

State t’ailt-d to score a run, as the
pitrln'ne' of Hunt, and ﬁelding 0f
the players, was too much for the
State nine. Nernrtheless. the old

allege nine lost its
. game in hasehall last
altt'rtlnon at Ridgelield

State College lighting spirit was ‘
evidenced throughout the game:
and we have good reason to be

proud of a team who inne'llt so
earnestly, and played so hard, as
did our nine at last Friday‘s game,

Agpics at Amherst. \la.
