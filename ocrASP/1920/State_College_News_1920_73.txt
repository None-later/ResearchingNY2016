TENNIS COURTS

Exercise is one of thc, necessities
of health and strength, and every
student should have at least one
hour of outdoor exercise each day.
The authorities have decided that

 

there are not enough facilities 'at
State College for securing thls.
(hit: of the pleasautcsteways of
exercising is playing tennis. there-
fore. the plan of havint,r tennis
courts on the college campus ts

till: city courts are too far away [0“
us. The courts in Washington
I’ark are within less than a tivc
minute walk of collcg'c. and we can
play there any time wt: wxsh to.
It docs seem as if anyone who
wanted to play very badly could
walk that far. and if ttxcrcisc is
