censor which may he due us for
not having liccn more tart-ful to
get all the facts, we do not think
that it is entirely our fault that
these errors were not corrected
sooner. We (lid not know Iliat
there were errors until it was too
late to make corrections in the
following copy of the. ” News." Had
we known the facts we should hare
licen glad to make corrections In
the student assemhfy infntudiatcly
following the printing of the
article. 'l‘hcn. allhonph it is our
firm l)('llt‘f that Ilie students would
have found some way in which to
award sweaters to the ha. thall

\"C also feel that a role-st Is ill
order at this time. We happeni-
Io he present when a State College
man addressing a small liIiIlV of
:lllllt'lllﬁ and faculty members sa’
words to the effect that in Ullt' of
lln- student publications :in article
had appeared which made errin
cons sIatenu-nls: that the (ion-rum
had just recently signed a hi
makingr it punfshahlc Ir.) puhlisli
statements of this sort. and. if it
were so desired charges could he

which We first learned Ili:iI any
mistaki- had her-n made.

Now lt'l us first consider Iln-
last part of that spt't't‘li to the
effort that the artielt- should ht:
ignored. hecauso that is the part
which seems to us most iinporIanI.
The "News" is a college pulilit tiltill

THE OPE]: MIND

 

The expression. " an open mind "
trouhled us a little when we first
' force. It was one of
that the. faculty and
tilt! snien let fall most
. ———I. if it weri a common
L' eiyday sort of idea. Now we :iro
finding.r out what a few of Iliesu
II ings mean. and have formulated
some idea of what an opt-n mind is.
We wonder, however. if our con-
ception (32' it is the same as that oi
the ma‘ I y'»— as we want it to he.
'lo us opt-n mind " means a
mind as I'm-c from prejudice as
human nature will permit. it will
give (trt-ry idea lironp'ht to its
ultrnliun a critical, yet impartial
survey lirfort- it will consider in
corporatina this new thing into its
scheme of thought. It s a mind
that is t I‘ In pain a
most useful knowledge, ml one
that is desirous of maintaining
Iruth ere-n though iI rome- into
direct ronllict with one’s fnrincr
ideals and plans. ‘ in all Ihe
l'llL‘ll mind means I.in' play—in
llUllleli. in word. and in out] ‘ok.
We wonder lit-\V Iiiany of our
Il‘lllli" students have the open
