THE LAST OPPORTUNITY

 

 

 the college year dr. vs near
to its close, we like to |'L\[l€\V all
that has happened. This has eci”
tainly been a great year. 'l‘herc
have been many opportunities for
State t'ollcec folk to show their
spirit, and they have done it in a
iIiu_niii-r which has given the college
a hue reputation. Last week. with
thi' Moving-hp [Jay cxcr
tennis tournament. the
panic. and the play. is sinipli .ni ex~
ample of the llllt‘ spirit which has
prevailed all year.

college spirit. llr, llruhachi-r has

We, iiinctccu twenty-three.
neither rejoice nor regret that we
are Sophomor s. rrout the mar
ment we \\‘t‘l‘t elected by our sister
class until Murine-Up Day we
thoroughly enjoyed the role of
Freshmen. 'l'hcrc is somethng
unique about being a Freshman, be-
cause it i> quite different front any
other experience—and it is an ex—

Thcv 'cherish the notion that
Sophmnorcs i)(‘lllllt' to a class of
bold. meddlrsomc individuals, and
resolve that it is their mission as
Freshmen to squelch thc Soplim
mores with whom they come in
contact. As Freshmen. \vc lacked
nonr- of the aforesaid details. Day
by day we have become acquainted
with collch traditions, and have
learned to love S. C. T.. which

thing but what we had expected.
lcucc, according to the old prov-
erb, we have “lived and learned."
Then, oh, then, you “gay young
Sophomores!" we were disillu-
sioned about you, for you really
were. not the awful creatures we
thought you. tin the contrary, at
times you were quite amiable and
almost dear. We forgive you,
t\\‘t.'llly-l\\'ii, for all your pranks and
misdeeds, although—pcrliaps it was
not your Iault—you have not done
much to he forgiven for. course,
we are not a bit sorry for anything
we have done to you, but regret

lo the liditor of the News:

In order to forestall the natural
questions which are llcillg asked of
lllt' l‘edagogne l’ioni‘d concerningr
the appearance of the year book,
\\'(_' ft-l that a statement of our
prouress so far is in order. The
book, proof read and ready for pub-
lication, has been in the hands of
the printer for sci weeks.
With, as we thought, reasonable
good fortune, students would have
their copies by examination time.

The paper for the book was lost
in transit. The printer states that
he cannot get other . icr immedi-
ately, but that every effort is beini;r
made to ,cht track of some as soon
as possible. itt'clltllitll)’ the stit-

the college campus.

' hc “Sophs,” overjoyed by their
success in the competitive Fresh—
iiian—Sophomore stunts, raised their
banner on the ﬂagpole contrary to
all college traditions. This act
aroused the anger of the "Frosh."
who, urged on by upper classmrn,
resolved to raise their colors higher
than those of the rival Class, This
feat was accomplished by Julius
Fiscus. who, despite the frantic ei«
forts of Coleman, mounted the roof
of the. boiler house and proceeded
to climb the dizzy heights of the
chimney.

Several hours passed before any
movement of troops could be dc»
tected; then "Eddie" Link climbed
tip the side of the boiler house and
got on top of the roof. After a
garlic struggle hc was securely tied
with clothcsliue taken from the
neighboringr yards. The unpleasant
odors of carbolenc and hydrogen
sullid were detected, and it was
learned later that Jack Johnson
had a tube containing,r this mixture
broken in his pocket.

At 12-30 the “lirosh” decided
that the “Sophs” had left the field
of battle. and went home. it hap~
pencil, however, that just before
leaving liisciis climbed tip the stack
and plaeed white beneath the green.
Fink was thcn released and made
to pi'iitiliSi', that he would go home
and give no information.

llut the stories vary. The
“Sophs” say that \Vadc Miller
climbed up the inside of the Cllilll"
iiey and took the colors off, while
the “brash” say that the “Snphs”
were afraid of them, and that they
waited until the "Fresh" had gone,
lln-ii climbed the stack from the
outside and took the colors. [I
must be admitted, however. that thc
"Sophs" usctl strategy.
