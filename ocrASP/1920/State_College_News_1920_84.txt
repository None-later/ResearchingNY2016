hear iii mind that lntsic change. in
industrial and social life calls for
a littlt‘lttlinlll which strives to incor-
[)ltl'alt‘ the truths of modern life
into lilt‘ structure of our govern
tncnt.

'l‘vhe Iirst duty of our patriotism,
therefore. is to (ltflk‘ tine what the
actual needs and t '1 lion» oi our
little are; how tl dil t'l' from the
needs of a day that is past; what
new developments have come which
catl for new adjustments.

lf we are not to he merely L’to«
plans, pretending to change social
relationships. we must I'ect‘ignize
lllc hasic. conditions upon which a
society in atty historic period is
hased,

Hire of the most strikingly
i‘hanued conditions of modern life
is the phenomenal industrial devel»
opmetn oi the leth century. (lite
hundred years ago we would have
found industry in little groups, little
workshops mostly in the homes or
heside the ltotltes oi llte men who
worked itt them. (iraduallv IheSe
little units were tttt'rtted into lar tr
units tttitil this industrial evolution
lltlaily culminated in the ,'.:i '
trust eonthinations of ottr day.

To the unthinking. this concen-
trating of industry has seemed t‘lt
unmitigated menace to the peoplt
.\ little analysis, however, will show
that cotithinations of this character
are prerequisite conditions for a
greater development of civilization
and democutcy.

"lih' concentration of indnstrv
has eiminated wa'teful competi—
tion, waste, oi time. lalmr and ma-
terial and tends to eliminate all in~
ellicienl methods of production.
This industrial evolution tends to
specialize Ialmr and machinery to
their highest point (It elliciency attd
thus has marvelously increased the
production of all human neces.
ties upon which the pursuit of life.
liherty and happiness depends.

We have, then, iii the United
States a sound 'onndatinn upon
which it is possible to re. a social
