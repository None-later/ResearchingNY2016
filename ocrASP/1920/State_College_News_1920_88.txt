FACULTY RECEPTION
Opens Social Season

On Friday evening. Sept. 35, the
lirst social event of the college year
was held. when the faculty gave a
reception for the freshmen and
their junior sisters and brothers.
The afliair was very informal since
there was no receiving line as there
has usually been on previous years.

The gymnasium looked its best,
as it was .prettiiy decorated with
evergreens, palms. flags and ‘ban-
ners. including the. junior banner
and sorority and fraternity ban-
ners. ("in one side of the gym-
nasium were the numbers, 1924.
lighted with electric lights.

The iirst part of the evening was
spent in getting acquainted. Each
person wore a slip of paper upon
which was written his or her name.
Dr. llrubachcr gave a short talk in
which be. welcomed the freshmen
and in which he gave the class of
1924 the name. the f’iigrim Class.
He did this since i920-2i is the.
300th anniversary of the landing of
the Pilgrims in America. Dr. Bru-
ba‘cher's speech was followed by a

most interesting talk by Dean
Horner. He compared the career

of a college student to Christian's
journey which is described in Run—
yaii’s Pilgrim‘s Progress. The
closing part of the program was a

"sing" led by the college song
leader, Miss Agnes Underwood.
Music was furnished throughout

the evening by Miss Kathryn Bali

and Miss Grace Aronowuz. After
the program ice cream and cake
were served. Those who were

present are indebted to the faculty
for a very pleasant evening.

CO-OP BOOK SHOP

 

it is safe to say that within the
past few days every member of
the faculty and student-body has
had occasion to become acquainted
with the new ACO—OD Book Shop, and
has come to know how very handy
and useful it is to have such a shop
in the building at which they can
.i'iurchase everything from Casseil's
Latin Dictionary, Meritory Books
and fountain pens to penny pads
and thumb tacks.

However, there seems to be a
mistaken notion about that the
Book Shop is under the supervision
of Y. W. instead the “Co—op" is
ﬁrst, foremost and last a Faculty
Book Shop, thought of by the Fac-
ulty, organized by the Faculty and
supported by the Faculty. Miss

 

i‘lelcn i’ay of the College Faculty ‘

is in charge of the Book Shop, and
it is due to her untiriiig efforts that
this new plan has been such a won-
derful success.
