welcome to the class of l924. We
are sure that as soon as yoli get a
chance to look around after the
hustle-bustle of registration that
you will be as proud of your Alma

' Mater as any of the rest of us. We

‘ start things.

certainly are glad to see the famil-
iar Yellow and W'liilc brought back
to these halls by such promising
looking guardians. >

And now will'yon accept a little
suggestion from your elders? e
are depending on you to show
plenty of life and pep. Yes, he sure
that you know your History II.
when quiz day comes around, but
save a little time to enter into so-
cial activities. Don‘t be afraid to
‘ The rest of us are
becoming somewhat old and seri-
ous. Even the Sophs are weighed

. down hytheir responsibilities. We
, need a little of your youthful ag—

gressiveness and vigor to stir us up

, to our former enthusiasm.

 

FRESHMEN, BELONG

One of the best things about col-
lege is belonging to its organiza-
tions and clubs—because that is
belonging to college. And belong-
ing to college makes college belong
to your. So, Freshmen, start early
and belong.

There are so many things for us
and Our interests and they‘re all
waiting for you, Freshmen. First
of tall are our religious organiza—
tions, to one of which every college
student should Ibelong—Y. .
C. A., Newman Club and Canter-
bury Clu‘b, and Episcopal Club.
These clubs not only further re-
ligious interests,r‘but do much in a

- social way for the enjoyment of the
Y students.

' lar organizations at college.

G. A. A... the Girls Athletic As-
sociation, is one of the most popu-
The

‘ dues are small, the membcrsip 'un-

 

restricted. and- the good times
many. G. . . provides a line
comrader atmosphere and the op-
portunities for'new and enjoyable
friendships. .
' Then, there's your own class, ’24.
You'd want that to, he the best

 

 

 

'cliiss yet—so make it the best!
Get in on everything your class
does; attend your class meetings.
help on your committees, and work

Beside these biggest things there

are clubs for all and every special
interest. Amon r these are the
Chemistry Club, blathematies Clu'b,
French Club. Music Club. Spanish
Club, the Drniiiatics and Art Asso-

ciaiionhPoliiica‘l Science Club, and.

Press Club.
Even with all this'ive have one
more thing we want you Freshmen
to do. Try out for publication
boards. There are two college pith—
lications open to you— the " Quar~
terly," a literary magazine, and the
“ News,” a weekly newspaper. in
Whichever line your interests lay
let us know soon by handing your
namvs tn the senior editors for try
outs. ii you have never tried re-
porting.r or writing before. start
now. The “ News " wants so many
Fres/hnien reporters that it will
have to start a daily. '

Come on, Freshmen. and start
belonging—to everything, and

your Alma Mater.

OUR WAY

State Collegel has always been
lrientlly—(lun't you Freshmen ﬁnd
it so? lint let's make it even more
friendly, by gettingr the "Hello"
spirit.

Say “ llellol" say it seven bun»
tired and lifty-nine times a day if
necessary, but say it. Don't walk
around like a Spliinx-smile and
then say “Hello!” Freshmen. never
mind if you (loiiit know every single
one of us or just whal our names
are —speak to us, please. And uip-
per~cl s. n and Sophomores, let's
not make the Freshmen speak lirsl.
The “Helios” won’t p' ss unheedctl.
especially when ’24 sees that that is
the State College way.

llcllo, Freshmen!
