OUR POLICY

“’0 believe that it ban been the
custom in previous yrars for the
editors of the “News” to state a
definite policy at the be'inning of, the
college year. 'l‘hcrcf c in ordcr
to avoid any possible nusumlcrstaml—
inﬂ. we wish to set forth as briefly as
possible our aims.

in the first place it is our policy to
try to maintain the high standards of
loyalty to nation, state, and college
institutions, which have been set up
by the cditnrs of former years.

in the second place we uhnll cu-
dcavor to bring heforc the faculty
.and students a newspaper edited as
promptly and as neatly as possible,
which shall excite greater intcrcst in
State College and State College al~
fairs. in order to do this we must
have co-opcration on the part of all
college reporters. All notes should
be in by Monday noon, and they
should be written leginy on one side
of the paper only.

Through our editorial columns we
aim to express State College senti-
ment in regard to all matters. and in
order to the fair we want to know all
sides of important issues. So we will
be glad to publish any leltcrs properly
compiled and signed.

ith cooperation on the part of
the student body, we hope to put
forth a publication which will be a
record of college life well worth
saving. ‘

STATE COLLEGE’S GLEE
CLUB

One thing which \Vc lack al Static
Collcgc and which we ought to have
is a College (ilcc Lllub. Must col-
leges of pond standing have one, and
it has been found that it in a great
addition to college life. We certainly
have material for the formation of
one, and there is no [Hason why we
should not have it. Such a club
\vnuld nlcan a lot for our collcgc.
especially at the present time. Thu
industrial dcpartmcnt has been re-
nmvcd from here. and that meant
that the number of Iucn enrolled is
greatly diminished. thus fairing away
from our athletic activities. A good
glee club would give us another in-
terest and contraction with intercol-
lcgiatc circlcs. it would also be of
grcat aid and help In us. and would
give studch with musical ability an
upt‘mrtunity in make more of llu‘ir
talcnt.

it in a success. to farm a basis for the
formation of a State Collcgr f‘ilcc

ing in chorus singing. and from it a
chorus for t‘niit'gu concerts is to in:
formcd. This will he a splendid
start. and crcry student who can

LETTER BOX

 

11:35 ON FRIDAY
llcar liditor:

Why in it nrrcssary in say so much
about lhosc lifty minute.» cvrry iiri»
day? l ' is it that students drrad
to go to . s Iubly and so nflcn takc
in buok< and papers In read? it is
llt‘t‘flllst'. student anscmhly is uni what
it should be. 'l‘hc stndcnts get
cnuugh dry lectures during the week
and i should think anscmbly should
he an hour of itttt'rcst and pleasurc
rather than a dull one. i have seen
an assembly where attendance was
not required and every scat was oc-
cupicd and outsiders would often
come to see the program. Why was
this assembly successful? Hero is
the general division of time. The
first twenty minutes were given to
the song leader, who led in the slug-
ing of school songs. class songs and
popular songs. Then ten minutes
were given to devotional services and
the remaining time was given to some
live speaker. who would speak mostly
on current events or give a‘ reading.
This latter part of the time was in
charge of the president of the col—
logo and was always instructive and
interesting. i wish that State Col—
lege might have an interesting and
Instructive assembly and that the
song leader might have from ﬁfteen

 

   

to twenty minutes each Friday to'

help us cuter into the spirit of song.

VESPERS
Dear Editor:
‘For all college students, but espe-
crally freshmen, Sunday afternoons

are long and lonesome: they are
actually dreaded because there is

 

"nothiut to do." Oflcouruc there
are the home time iman at the Find
Presbyterian Church, but [very few
college students attend. Minn Stan:
College needs is amncllung‘ that the
student body tau claim as their own,
will feel perfectly frcc to cnmy,
Why not Sunday afternoon Vcspcrs.’
There were lhrcc. or four Vesper
services last year, and how they were
enjoyed by those who attendedl
There was for one the excellent
'Ilhanksgiving service at which llr.
ix‘ichardson spoke. Ilut what we nccd
is murc of them, somelhin *' in which
the studcut body can too forward
regularly. If it isn't always possible
In obtain a speaker, what (i s it
umttcr? Let it be on thosc ucc ‘imm
an informal get-together and sing.
'I‘hcrc‘s nothing in the World anyway
to chccr the honwsick heart like some
of those good old-fashiom-d thymus.

And now in just the right time of
flu! year, too, at which to start foh"
per st'i‘\'icc,~‘. Soon it will be 1m) cord
to take long afternoon walks, and the
aftcrnonus themselves will be too
short. Lct us have Vespers and get
the habit for the winter. until liaslcr
at least.
