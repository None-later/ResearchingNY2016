of ’24 at a “ get wise meeting."
large ‘Ct‘ttll'tl of sophomores and
freshmen were present and also
some npperclassmen. while Dr.
t'roasdale and l)r.. Evans repre-
sented the faculty.

Each fresh was met in the ball
by a sophomore who blindfolded
him and led him toyhis doom. All
were branded with their mark, '24,
and initiated into all the curiosities
of State College. Some. begged for
mercy and others demanded it, but
no quarter was given. Rut. al-
though some were quite frightened
and there experiences were really
terrifying, on the whole the frosh
showed great fortitude and self-
possession.

At last their blindfolds were re-
mm'cd anti they opened their eyes
upon a very pretty scene. The
gym was prettily decorated with
Japanese lanterns and the lights
were soft and colored. The large
flag was draped on one side of the

it is an honor to be a member of

All freshmen and sophomores

OH, FROSH!

Said the senior to the freshman:

“Twixt you and me is a mighty
.chasm.

We represent the extremes, my
friend,

You the beginning, I the end."

The freshman made reply,

;\s he winked his honest eye:

“Well. when I look at you, old
man.

l'm rather sorry i began."

l not sure no freshman of S. C.
'l‘. holds such an idea of our
seniors; instead i feel positive that
every one of '24 wants to do every“
thing in his or her power to be like
the class of ‘21. Every member of
'3l knows the college songs, ‘.4,
do you? if not. why not? The
(‘nllegc Song l'look, on sale in the
tails, contains them all.

WESTERN ,ALUMNI
BRANCH IN PROCESS
OF ORGANIZATION

 

.‘\t a recent informal gathering
of the six State College alumni
who are t'nching at North Tona-
wauda, plans for the formation of
a western branch of the Alumni.
.\ iation were brought up and
tlthlh‘Sk‘ll. with a view toward gets
ting all alumni in that part of the
state in touch with each other, for
their mutual benefit and the wel~
fare of their Alma Mater. Atztltc
present time the Utica branch is
the one farthest \Vcst. leaving all
the alumni located in the vicinity
of Rochester and Buffalo without
an organization. This means that
there can be no concerted effort on
the part of these alumni to keep
alive the ideals of their college and
to " boost State " as it deserves to
be boosted for its earnest endeavors
and worthy aecomplishments.

  

There are without doubt many
State College graduates teaching
or residing in the above-mentioned
locality. who would be more than
pleased at such an opportunity for
reunions, and a chance for advcrj-
tising their college and spreading
itstprestige as it has truly deserved.
For this reason an effort is being
made, through the courtesy of the
“News.” to get in touch with as
many alumni as possible, in order
that their opinions and suggestions
for such an organization might be
obtained.

Commnnieations will be glaudly
received by any of the following
alumni: Mabel Wade. '14; F. ller-
rick Conners. 'l7; Beatrice M.
leard, ’19; Jean Antes Conners,
'20: Louise Stacker, ’20; Louis T.
Masson, 'ZO—ztddress High School,
.\'orth Tonawanda. New York .

Let all who are interested join
this movement with the usual Spirit
of the Purple and Gold, and make
State College the pass~wnrd from.
Albany all the way across the state
to the western border. '
