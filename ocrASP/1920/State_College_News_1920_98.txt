TO STATE COLLEGE MEN

 

To the half hundred or so men
in State College this article is
especially addressed. ‘Your nun»
her is not great, but your possibil-
ities are many, It is practically in
your hands to decide whethel‘, with
the end of this year State College
Will remain a co-cd institution.
With the removal of the industrial
Department to Buffalo there was a
great decrease in the number 'of men
registering this” year. Moreover,
nearly half of the present number
are members of this year's g‘l‘tltill'
atiiig class. 'That ineaiis'tliat un-
less something is done to attract
the .attention of eligible young
men, State College will be without
any male representation in a very
few years.
iThete is 'only one way to pre-
vent such a thing. That is for
every man to do his level best to
make State College more of a
man's college. First of all there is
the major sport, basketball, Every
man stould be out for the inter-
class contests. Aud‘when the call
is issued for varsity practice, every—
one should be there to help make a
team, Then there are the minor
sports, baseball, track, and hockey.
There must be equal spirit shown
in regard to them. Furthermore
there is the Men’s Glee Club. which
is about to be instituted. That
must not be neglected. And how
about a gel-together or smoker?

These are only a few of the ways
in which it can be done. if any-
one knows anything new alon ' this
line. he should let the rest inow
about it. Start a campaign for a
hundred new mcn“ucxt year, and
get, them!

ARE COLLEGE pm].
BEST DAYS?

 

Our friends, who are a great deal
older than we are, tell us, our col-
lege da 5 are the best days of our
lives. {Va think that perhaps they
are right, for they have lived longer

 

than we have, but we cannot really
believe that ‘their statements are
quite true. We argue that the
future —-the dim, far-off time when
all our dreams are to be realized,
so we liope—-must hold more for
us than the present does.

Whether our college days are
our best days, or whether they are
only foundation stones upuii which
We plan to build a wonderful future,
the necessity of getting the most
out of them is just the same. At
college we learn to understand and
to appreciate. to some extent at
least, things that were before only
names to us. We liiid that it IS
really the fair play spirit that
makes athletics worth while. But
aside from these things-thepnes
we usually stress too much~—if we
make own one or two real friends
while we are in college, we have
done a great deal towards making
our life there successful. For,
after all. is it not our friends that
do so much to make things pleasant
for us, in school and afterwards?
To have friends, one must be a
friend, of course, This implies our
need of sympathy, consideration,
and kindly interest for our friends’
welfare. If we all tried to cultivate
these qualities, what a spirit of
friendliness would pervade our col-
lege. Do you think that anyone
would ever mourn because there
was too friendly a spirit here? We
are friendly—but let's be. even

OUR ADVANCES

 

livery your State College is ac-
quiring something new which
makes the college bigger and bet‘
ter. This yctlr its new acquircmeiit
is a fine book store—the Co-op
llook Club. People would surely
be even more appreciative of .the
book store if they had to do Witli~
out it. So many colleges, if not all,
have stores where they can buy
books, that without it State College
was hardly on an equal basis with
them in that respect. All of the
students ouglit‘ to he very grate-
ful to the faculty for conductingr
the Comp Book Shop.

Besides being able to buy new
books there has also been a good
opportunity for buying and for put-
ting on sale second-hand books. It
is a relief to be able to have onc's
books sold without having the re—
spriiisiiiiiity of selling them and try-
iiig to liud customers. From the
customer’s point of view it is con-
venient to have some place to go
for books. Freshmen especially,
do not know who has books to Sc”,
and with the second-hand store
they have no need of knowing.

of course everyone has patron~
ized both departments of our new
store. but I think everyone needs
a little reminder that the new
establishment is one which we truly
should appreciate and of which we
have been in need for so long.

YOUR “ QUARTERLY ”

The “Quarterly” at the begin-
ning of a new year solicits the sup«
port and co-operation of the stu-
dent body. It would have you feel
a personal interest in its meander-
ings. If you disapprove, it wants
to know, If you are pleased, it
wants to know that. The “Quar-
terly” proﬁts by your criticisms,
positive or negative. »

Out of courtesy to new students
it might be well to explain what

 

 

 

the State College "Quarterly" is.
First, it is the college magazine,
We stress the iltljcclch, for it is
essentially a home product.
Next, the "Quarterly " repre—
sents the highest achievement in a
literary way of which we as n col~
logo, are capable, but—still main-

‘tniniiig its literary excellence—it

also aims at popularity in the
rarer sense of the word. While.
perhaps more intimately connected
with the English department than
any other, it would serve and iii-
tercst all departments. While not
wanting to please someone with
everything all of the time, it would
please everyone with something
once in a while.

This. briefly, is the “ Quarterly,”
a magazine finding its conception in
the natural need of expression by
a few, but living only through the
approval and expressed inlercst of
the multitude.

LETTER BOX

Dear Stale College:

This is not a distinctly new dc-
partnient because we have always
been pleased to print any letters to
the Editor. lint—it is a very
deﬁnite space which \Vt' waiil to
set aside for everybody all the time
and We want it jammed full of stu-
dent expression. l'lcase write for
it. Whenever you have a new idea,
feel proud of anything State Col-
lege has done. or have crilicisms
of any part of college life, let the
rest of us know it—this way we
will print any class or personal
sentiments, so long as they are not
malicious, in this column. Let's
hear frnni you, ‘
Dear Editor:

Do you know, ’24 may have
thought that '23 was going to let
things drift on just as they were.
'l‘liey know differently now; ’23 has
Shown her spirit, and no tame one
is it either. The freshmen made
up their minds that they weren’t
going to let the sophomores out
of the Science Building onc cer-
tain memorable Wednesday after-
noon. but they soon discovered that
grit. not numbers, counts, and
hereafter we are sure that they will
be good, kind obedient, little frosh
when they ﬁnd a group of sopho-
mores collected at the front door.
for that was another lesson they
learned that memorable Wednes—
day. that the sophomores intend to
have their rules obeyed.

As a kindly suggestion. and well
meant, we hope that the freshmen
will study English 1 B faithfully,
for they really need to if they ex-
pect us to know what they are yell»
ing when they get together on the
campus and bowl.

And please, ’24, don't forget to
speak when you meet our officers
in the corridor or on the street.
it’s only courteous to be gracious
to the Faculty. Myskania, and our
officers. But above all remember
that the spirit of '23 is' on guard.—
Beware! '23.
