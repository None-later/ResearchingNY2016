room and the banner of '23 hung
in the center. l,)r. Evans and Dr.
('roasdnlc beamed down upon the
fresh, and they felt quite at home
when they saw the skeleton in the
corner. Then the music started
and everyone danced. Kathryn
Ball and Grace Aronowitz played
the tirst part of the evening, Sher~
bet and wafers were served. and
after dancing until eleven. every—
one went home feeling that they

had really 'had a good time.

No Wonder

Men get along better with men
than women do with women. At
least we think they do, says a
writer in “ Life." And the reason is
that men are more used to liberty
than women are antl readier to con-
cedc it. Women also seem better
constituted to live with men than
with women, which is just as it
should be. One grown woman is a
fairly comfortable provision for any
house — not counting servants
(who have their own troubles about
getting along with one another).

Frequently women who have had
fifteen or twenty years‘ experience
as the sole grown-up woman of the
house have daughters grow tip on
them. We would like to see statis—
tics of the proportion of families in
which that makes trouble. it is a
natural trouble. The boss~womau
who has been sole despot of her
branch of the. domestic kingdom
has gradually to yield indepemlencc
and a vote to another grown
wotnan living under the same roof.
The boss-woman has to learn to
live with another grown-up female
after being twenty years out of
practice. And that‘s not easily
done. No wonder mothers anti
daughters have their conﬂicts.

When Steadiness is Golden

“What attracted you to your
bride?" asked the judge, after the
ceremony.

“Well. salt," replied the ebony-
hued bridegroom, “de fust time I
seed Dinah here she kinder tuk my
eye. She wuz such a likely lookin’
woman an' so handy wid herself,
but when l learnt dat she wuz
doiu’ steady washin’ for seven fami-
lies. sah, right den an’ dar I sur-
rendered.”

First Magazine Editor—"l be-
lieve my youngster is cutout for an
editor."

Second Editor—“Why so? "

First Editor—“Everything he
gets his hands on he runs and
throws into the waste-basket."

The Elaborated Spook
“So you believe in ghosts?"
“Not in words of. one syllable.
But I attach great Importance to
psychic phenomena."—— Washington
