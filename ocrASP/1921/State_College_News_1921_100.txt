1925—- Back to Work Class

herited as rush of .‘ t' ' We
sung the Alina .\late- of course.
'l'hett we all joined in singing to
President lirulnicher. Someone has
been heard to remark that the son):

written to the tune of "Smiles."

in}.r class of ’25.

Mr. Schwah believes that half of
the difﬁculties of these trying years
of the Reconstruction period would

“Back to Work" class. This is a
