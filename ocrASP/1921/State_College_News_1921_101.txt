1925 ATTENTION!

 

Now then you frosh lend me your
best car and seriously meditate on
what i have to impart to you. Open
your “Freshman Hand, hooks," turn
to page 35 and read what you will
see there, provided your eyesight is
good. When we say “The follow-
ing have been accepted as Liollegc
traditions," we do not mean ac-
ccptcd by the class of '34. or the
class of ’ We mean that they
have been acccptcd by every class
that ever helped wear a path to the
mail box outside the News oflicc.
Also, we mean that they are to be
accepted by the class of ’25,

You as freshmen should feel as
much of a thrill when you fulfill one
of these traditions as you will when
you break a sophomore rule. Do
not expect the sophs to enforce
traditions. Enforce them your-
selves! The sophs have a measly
150, as Compared to 260 in the class
of ’25. What chance have they of
enforcing traditions? None at all!
Therefore get busy. Sec to it that
all your fellow and sister frosh live
up to every tratlition‘ from number
one to number ten inclusive.

Also in conclusion let me state
that we expect you to startuow and
keep right on enforcing these tradi-
tions until June 25, 1925.

E. C. Osborne, '22.

A SHORT TRIP ON 'A
THOUGHT LIMITED

The talk which Doctor Graves
gave in the ﬁrst Assembly certainly
opened the way for considerable
cngitation upon it worth while sub-
ject. Every one of us who claims
even' a passing acquaintance with
self must have been aware that the
announcer of is or her trains of
thought reported the opening of
several old and new lines and an-
nounced that very special accomo-
dations would be made up at the
will of that subjective self that
wanders so purposiver thru the
realm of consciousness; Unfortun-
ately, however, the nature of thcsc
accomodation-spccials is such that,
while the lines of thought are open,
the trains cannot be dispatched
without the volition of this strapgc
traveler, who‘ is not only a passen-

  

 

ger, but also engineer and conduc:
tor. All aboardl ,‘-‘

Especially interesting is the idea
that the elements of character exist
or function in antithetical pairs;
that character, or nature, or self,
as you will—is never simple but
always complex, We are each of
us poascsscd of a dual personality.
Who is by nature hottest, is also
dishonest by nature, but the mani-
festation of the one element or the
other is dependent upon habit of
thought. We are all acquainted
thru personal experience with the
varying quality of honesty manifest
under differing circumstances
With our dearest friends we are
certainly more square than with
those to whom we are iu-dill'ercnt.
Yet honesty in any final analysis
or ideal sense must be absolute.
We are hottest or we are dishonest,
according as we react. The line

between honesty and dishonesty is

sharp and well defined, and our re-
actions place ns irrevocably on the
one side or the other, according as
they are in strict accord with an
intelligent ideal of honesty, or are
in some phase or other of doubtful
fairness. [t is well, then, to give
a little thought to the various
phases of our dealings with others,
a: least until we have developed
habits of thought that will permit
of deviation from the right side of
tl‘c line. if we would be square to
ourselves, we must be square to
others,

Station is Space-limit! All
change to your own individual
trains of thought for other points
.'lutlg the line. ’22
