the numerous spots of local histori-
cal interest. Then there is just one
other “burdensome duty" of a lrosh.
That is to reserve sullicicnt time for
recreation. Not that it is a burden
to choose a jolly good time, but it
is tlillicult to choose a really worth
while amusement when there is a
movie house on each corner. and it
is so convenient to 20 lo the
"Colonial" when a person has only
seventeen cents to his name.

THE VICE-PRESIDENT
ON‘THE CLASSICS

(From Youths’ Companion.)

Although Greek and Latin are
having a hard time of it to maintain
their position as essential founda—
tions of a liberal education, they are
not without friends. The Vice—
Presitlcrit of the United States, who
is a graduateof a New England
college where the classics still have
as much honor .15 they have any»
where in the country, is the latest
eminent champion to come to their
defense. We have no room even to
summarize his excellent address be-
fore the American Classical League,
but we can call attention to a few
of the reasons that he gave for lcccp—
ing Greek and Latin ﬁrmly fixed in
the college curriculums,

The study of the classics serves a
double purpose-it is a means of
culture and is a mental discipline.
An acquaintance with the poetry
and philosophy of Greece, with the
literature and legal learning of
Rome. and with the history and
tradition of both countries. is indis-
pensable to a really liberal cultui .
Our literary standards, our political
standards. our artistic standards.
our standards of thought and rea—
soninrﬁr and scirntilic inc-thud, ari- es—
tablishcd on the classics "Without
them," as ,\lr, Coolidge said. “there,
can be no interpretation of langnac'c
or lilcraturc, no adequate Cllllllll'l“
heusion of history, no understand
ing of the foundations of philosi‘lphy
and law. :\nd the natural scirnces
are so much the product of men
trained in the vi sics that without
that training their very terminology
cannot be hilly nntlerstr‘rod.”

llnt it is true that the classics,
though imlispcnsablc for culture.
are not wholly taught for their cul-
tural value and are sometimes
taught without any proper insistence
on that value. lint even when they
are taught pcdantically, when it is
the syntax of the language on which
the teacher spends his pupils' tinn‘.
when the tll‘)‘ bones of the study
rattle mninnnsly in the classroom—
cven then there is sturdy mental (lis«
(ziplincs in memorizing, in rcas 1-
ing, in concentrating, in acwlnpli 1--
ing srnncthing diliicult against your
inclination, that maltes the \‘lassics
a far more effective means of
strengthening and tougheningr the
brain tissue than some of the less
exacling' studies that are offered to—
day as substitutes for them. The
proper thing. of course. is to teach
both syntax and literary apprecia-
tion; one who has had the luck to
get his Greek and Latin from a
teacher who is at home in both
fields has gone through an cduca~
tional experience that has no equiv--
alcnt.

It is not necessary that everyone

 

 

 

 

Ih'llolllll study the classics. but some

In eve.y generation should. From
them we draw much of our faith in
liberty. in democracy and in order
under the law; from them springs
our interest in literature and the
arts: without them our religious he‘
liefs and practices would be widely
different from what they are. If
the leaders of our intellectual and
social life ever become as a hody
unfamiliar with the classics, our
civilization will become a more sor-
did and rapaclous thing than the
world has yet seen. Our modern
culture heng with the revival of
classical study in the ﬁfteenth cen«
tury. No one will assert that that
culture has become a finer or more
healthy thing during the half cen-
tury in which it has become fash-
ionable to turn up the nose at the
classics.
