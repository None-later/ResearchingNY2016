FACT OR. FICTION?

\\'i: know what it is to lose like
a orntleman, or to win like a
gentleman; to yield a point grace-
Hilly. or to score one modestly.
\\c all pride ourselves on at least
attempting to conduct our lives m
accordance with the ahovu rules of
gnutl sportsmanship. One of the
csujllll'dl qualities of thorough-hrqu
nnmhood and womanhuml is the
ahility to " meet with ’l‘riumph and
Disaster and treat those two im-
pustct's‘ just the same."

A large and hitter dose, that. yet

than we are taking a small matter
of industrial readjustment.

Our State College is a dcmocrm
tic institution. it is a good place
in which to get wise to ourselves.
The spirit of the times is " hack to
work.” it is only an infant spirit
in' this country as yet, just as the
“Back to Work" Class is an in-
fant class in State College. t is
for us all, then, to be real good
sport's, to play the game, and to
help the spirit oi ” hack ,to work ”
to grow in'college. in home. and in

TO MUSICIANS

 

There has been some talk about
College concerning those people
who sidestep different musical ac-
tivities. These people have talent
and they her: to be excused, saying
“Oh, .I have too many studies to
attend to, without attending chorus
practice, or orchestra rehearsal,
etc.. etc., -— "

.‘ow. you people who have been
shirking‘, let‘s see you step out with
the others. ll you have musical
talent, use it hy all means. The
College Orchestra, Girls’ Glee Club,
and .\leu's Chorus other you every
opportunity to learn the beauty of
music and the value of musical in-

lerprelation.
don’t he a slacker

Moreover.

when we sing at Chapel excrci. .
ll you feel that you are not a
tialli-Liurci or a John McCormark.
at least hum the song‘s over to
yourself. .ll you merely fuel the
spirit of our college song's it will
ltelp you lo study harder and play
the “game” hotter at State.

it is strange that people in eol~

material handed in, they are not
able to. Again we repeat that all

CONCERNING COEDS,
ED. SAYS:

Gee, Lottie.

Neither do i. tint, gosh darn these
vanrps-ln-the-hudl .‘lhout a dozen
times a day they hand me out for
not saying "Hello" to some ment-
her oftthc penalty committee or put
me out of a seat in the rotunda——
you know what it rotunda is, Louie;
it'. '1 sort (ii—well, you know what
it is. Anyhow, the freshics aren't
supposed to sit in the rotunda.

I got sonnnhin’ funny to tell you.
|.uuic. The other day I not stalled
on the top lloor oi the, lab. huildiun.
l: hadda gel. one 0' these lanes to
help me lind my way out. Alter
she liually got me headed for the
door, I thought she'd hit it 1:0 Ill
that. She inurer on. though. till l
had to say, "You needn't hothor
shuwin‘ me out."

"tlh," she rhortlvs. “’laiu't no
lrunhle tn show you out. Ha Ha."
ivt-ryhndy lnught-tl. hlt‘hht' l'nl
thick. Louie, hul' hall the slull they
spring around here, goes over the
luv.

Then I llt'ntls for tln- it‘ll side of
one of Hit- doors and 21 whole mph

“Who’s the valodietoriau from

Wouldn’t lhat give you harhed—

ruse nit-‘0' not ch-anin' those pink
galters what Aunt Arabella sent
me, hut when I get on that'hrown
Sears~l<ochuck suit, those Mont‘
