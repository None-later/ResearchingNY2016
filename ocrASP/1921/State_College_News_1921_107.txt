classes are working cvcry after—
noon in the gym. Although it is
early to predict, several of the new—
comers are showing up well. Some
good ’varsity material is being de«
vclopcd.

NEW JAZZ ORChmsTRA

 

A new orchestra—one devoted to
jazz music only—has been organ-
ized at State. It made its ﬁrst ap-
pearance at the soph-frosb “get-
wisc" party, and everyone is talking,’
about it yet.

safari: COLLEGE '  oc'ronER 10,1921

The men and girls who make up
the orchestra, have been having
regular rehearsals for some time,
and they feel that they can now
offer their services to State. Al-
though the ranks of this new or-
chestra are Illlt‘tl by State. people
only. it is in no way connected with
|ln- regular college orchestra. These
jazz artists are full of the idea of
boosting .‘H‘tatti by providing “the
real thing" at. the dances and has-
ketball games this winter. "l'he jazz
orchestra has come, and all the
dancers at State want it to stay.

The members oi the orchestra are
well known at State as among the
best of jazz playrr~. Here they
are: piano, Vivian llart, ‘25. vio—
lins. Grace .‘\rrmr,nvilz, '23. aml ller-
bert Morning, ‘25, lutnjo-mamlolin,

passed over without wetting us.
We were well repaid for our
