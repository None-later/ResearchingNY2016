TO THE PACIFIC IN
'80 DAYS

By Dr. Gertrude E. Douglas
To complete the western picture,
some cowboys sprang up from no-
where and gave us a line exhibition
of liorseniansliip. We appreciated
this the more later. when we missed
the round-up at Cody by a single
day. owing to car trouble.

"he Yellowstone trail led us
through some wicrdly beautiful
country in Wyoming, over prairie
roads, mere trails in many cases,
through rugged red and yellow
almost hare of vegetation
aiid with very few traces of hninan
habitation. We wondered indeed
where the childrein lived who at-
tended the line rural schools which
we passed frequently—and still
more who paid the taxes to keep

and farther into the desert and
realized the hardships which they
must have endured. Ve entered
the park from the east, through
Cindy and the Shoshone canyon.
and, let me advise you, if you are
contemplating a trip to the park
some day, to go this way by all
means. As far as scenery goes,
the rugged canyon of the Shoshone
river can boast of more beauty than
the park itself. Cali you imagine

first time in a real primeval forest

I am appalled at the idea of telling
you anythingr about the Yellow-

book descriptions are not overdone,
and that the photographers can
never do it justice. You must go
and see it for yourselfl I smile
