A PLEA FOR THE
FUTURE

 

The interest of the world will
shortly be centered upon the con—
fcrcnce on the limitation of arma-
ments at Washington.

That the young people of this
country realize the magnitude of its
importance to them and to future
generations is evidenced by their
attitude at the present time. One
of the farthest reaching religious
organizations, embracing the youth
of several nations, has taken for its
slogan “A Warless World by 1923.“

A few weeks ago President
f-fibben of Princeton University,
in his matriculation sermon, stig-
gested that an association of stu-
dents in the nation’s universities be
formed to assist the Washington
conference to end the international
race for supremacy in armaments.

As a result 1,200 students of Penn
State College have unanimously rc-
solvcd to challenge the students of
Europe to join the undergraduate
bodies of America in such a con-
certed effort that there will be no
doubt that the men of the future
desire permanent peace.

They further propose that every
college in the land send delegations
on December .3 'to the Disarmament
Conference to present their pleas in
the name of the nation’s young
manhood to “end wars."

When one considers that war
cats at the foundation of the future,
that it claims the young men as its
victims, such resolutions and move—
ments have particular signiﬁcance.

 

THE LIFE OF ABBIE A.

r

 

Abbie Augusta is a junior;‘ yet
no one is really aware of the fact.
The reason for such a calamity is
this: Abbie came to college with
one desire, “to go through" college,
and that is precisely what she is

. title "a senior."

 

doing, 'just as she might walk
' through a park, unchanged and un-
changing. When she was a fresh-
man s c was afraid to go anywhere
for fear of spilling ice cream on her

secoud'best, or. being obliged to get -

acquainted wttt someone. She
never went to a class meeting,
never used the front door, never

spoke to an upper cla'ssfllrln and'

never, never did anything for any-
one but herself. And all this time
the other Co-Eds were having the
time of their lives, making friends,
teasing the sophomores and getting
."hillets doux." Sophomore ycar
Abbie Augusta kept right on “going
through" college, with only a few
people, such as registrars and pro-
fessors, knowing she existed. As a
junior, even the professors regard
her as a mere name on a class card.
To climax her college career she
will be listed in the I'cd. under the
‘ Could any college
biography be more pathetic than
this? No, never!

Now dear Abbie A’s in the bud
or flower, because there arc a lot
of you right here now. Wake up!

what class you are in; do some—
thing for someone if it be only

A QUESTION

 

Win-n twenty—two was a fresh~
man class, June ‘exams began June
second; by the end of [he first week
the freshrnan’s year was over, and
by the end of the next, upper class—
men were free. The large number
of girls who had planned to go to
the Silver Bay Conference wcrc able
to go. State College sent a dele—
galion of about thirty, enough to
compare favorably in numbers with
the groups sent from Mount
I'Iolyoke, Vassar, Wells anti other
colleges of the vicinity.

In the year l919~1920 it was de~
cided to give us two weeks’ vaca-
tion at Easter, and to prolong sec-
ond semester-one week in )unc.
Students favored the longer Easter
vacation enough not to object to
the later close of the semester.
Although a. large number of girls
had planned to go to Silver Bay,
the delegation was reduced to two.
Examinations conflicted with tihc
conference. Consequently we heard
much less about Silver Bay last
year, and received less from the
delegates’ contact with students of
other colleges.

Last year the Easter vacation
seemineg snapped back to a one~
week period automatically, and as
june approached inquiries brought
out the fact that the time of closing
in June was not to snap back a
week. Y. \V. girls who were able
to go to Silver flay at all, did so
only after arranging for special
exams. The delegation numbered
tcu. The girls who attended the
conference very naturally observer!
that we were among the very last
colleges in time of closing. Most
colleges were closed at least a week

. before State. Perhaps it is a matter

which onl those who'intend going
to Silver ay need consider, but the
objection to the lengthening of the
college year seems to become more
general as time goes on.

May we hear the opinions of
others who may or may not have
a different point of view? '22

 

ED SAYS: .

Gee, Louie, .

I may have been a wreck when I
came here, but .I sure am reckless,
now. Yep, they want me to be on
the football team, now. I told you
that I'd get there some day'. And
'tain't because they's only eleven
men in Collidgc, neither. 'I‘hey’s
twclvc, countingr a lame guy. Leave
it to me, Lomc, ch? They can’t
keep a good man down, can they?
Here’s one they can’t—by jiminces.

Say, Louie, did I tell you what
happened to me last week? I was
goiu up the stairs right in back of a
swell pair of Janos. All of a sud—
dcn, one of them dropped her
‘hankachif. i don’t suppose you'd a
known what to do in a case like
that, would you, Louie? I didn’t
think so. But I didn‘t buy Pumper-
nickcl’s "What to do in Parlor or

‘i; '. and at I'aradcs" for nothing.
No sn‘ce, bob. I just leaned over
nachal like and got it for her;

’ou'd ortcr heard the compli—
ment she paid me.

"Gee, he looks as if he had a
strong back," she says aloud to her
friend. Then she said snnipiu more
under breath that I couldn’t
quitr: h. Alls I could hear \ Is
sumpin about “mind.” jut she was
tclliu her girl friend that sin:
thought i must have a strong mind,
too, ch Louie? it kinda makes a
feliah feel good to hear some one
besides hilnscif talk about how
slick he is once in a, while, ch
Louie? You boll

Then, “You saved my life,” she
says kinda thoughtful like.

i knew shc was goin to say that.
Leave it to me, Louie. i can tell
what theyre lhinkin', can't I, Lon' '
You bet. So's i was ready for lief.

“Give rue a nickel, thats all its
worth," I says meanin thats all her
life was worth, Louie. l’rclty good,
illllt/lt? I'll say so. Besides you
know how devilish I am, Lottie.
I‘m just so full of the devil that I
can’t keep it in all the time, can I
Louie. You're right, I, can’t. I just
got to let it out once in a while.

And, would you believe me,
here's what she slings back at me.
“Where was you when that was
pulled off first?" she says, sarcastic
ike. “I know when: you was. You
wasn't," she says. “That stuff may
be new in Cobocs,” she says, “but
It was passe in the Mayflower."
Can you beat that.

Well, sir, you could a knocked
me out with an elastic crow bar, I
was so goldarued riled up. Ilut
you gotta admit that when it comes
to handin it back as fast as you get
if, f'm like the handle on a teapot,
Louie—I’m there, ch? You bet.
Not always there and never in it,
either.

“Your folks don’t keep a pig any
more since you came to Collidge,
do they?" I says just as sarcastic
as her.

And I’ll be gosh hanged if she
didn’t. luff right out in my face.
Yes stl'cc. Thats what she did.

She kept on a Iaffin so that f
commench to get hot up around
the ears. And she would stare at
my coilar'which i just had sharp-
ened—or I mean cleaned—at the
laundry. '

All to once she says, “Look out,"
she says, “or you'll set that cellu-
loid collar 0 yourn on fire if you
don’t stop blushin" she says.

‘ . I declare, Louie, these wimmen'll

be the death 0' me yet. Aw Shncks,
when they’re handin’it to me t‘hcyrc
laym' oﬂ‘a somebody else, what do
you say, ch? Aint that right.

The Prof that teaches me my
same old sore is the one that taught
the French to ‘say "They shall not
pass.” Am havin’ an awful time
With the course.

f-lopin' you’re the same, EDDIE.
