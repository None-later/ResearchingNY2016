springs, curious mud volcanoes and
wonderlul geyscrs. These there
wcrcvbut the greater part of it IS
primeval pine forest, covering the
slopes of the Great Divide. In it
is an exquisite lake in a setting of
snow—capped mountains and the
(irand Canyon, linth in all varic~
tics of bull, orange and rod, into
whose depths drops a stream of
clcar aquamarine. It has also hit.
Washburn, upon whose sides are
the gayest flower gardens I have
ever seen. Only a few spots were
barren, and here are the deservedly
famous green and blue hot pools

and geyscrs.

ders of these were extremely inter—
esting to the botanists of the party,

mcntcd algae, living plants, which
have acquired the characteristic of
enduring: temperatures just under
the boiling;r point. We were lor—
tunatc in seeing the Giant, the larg-
est 0f the gcyscrs. erupt, as he only
pours forth his mighty stream of
boiling; water every 14 days. Even
he with his tremendous volume,

sheer beauty to Old Faithful whose
graceful stream rises 150 feet into
the air every 60 or 70'minutes, true
to his name.
