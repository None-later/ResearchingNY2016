count of ten per rent to all student
members of the assot'iation ttpon
presentation of a membership card
at the time ol purchase.

Membership iii the. association is
tiltt‘ll to all students and members
of the faculty. The advantages of
tnembe in in the association are
tet'y plain. it is safe to say that
every fellow and girl in State (‘ol-
lt'gt' makes a number of purchases
in .\lbany during the "hool year.
He surely would apprectate a dis‘
count of text per cent on his pur-
rltases, and this is pos;"ble through
membership in the association. ;\
discount of ten per cent will mean
much to every student, and the best
part of tlte association is that it in-
rhtdes in its list of merchants grant-
ing" this discount, leaders in their
respective lines, and representing
every line of business ill the city.

Membership cards will be altered
to the students this week by Harold
