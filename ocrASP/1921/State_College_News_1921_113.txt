ON VOTING!

George William Curtis, in “The
Public Duty of ilducatcd Men,"
says: “l'ublic duty in this country
is not discharged, as is often sup-
posed, by voting. A man may vote
regularly, and still fail essentially
of his political duty, as the Pliariscc
who gave tithes of all that he pos~
sesscil, and fasted three limes in
the week, yet lacked the very heart
of religion.” How many of us fail
essentially of our political duty——
how many fail even to vote at all?
Ignorance oi the issue, indifference
to the issue, and pure laziness on
the part of the competent and intel-
linen-t voters—these are lllc causes
of rotten politics and undesired
legislation. livery son and daugh-
tcr of State is, or will be, a voter,
and it is up to every one of us to
acquire the habit of conscientious
discharge of public duty. But if
present habits are any prediction of
future ones, it is time someone set
an alarm for dormant consciences.
Take this matter of adopting a con-
stitution for the Student’s Associa-
tinn. Consider a moment. it is a
matter of student self-government.
in our present status, it is even
more vital to each one of us than
is the government of the country.
Cast a retrospective glance into the
assembly where we are considering
the matter. Count the number who
are votingt on a question that con-
ccrns them personally. What is
the answer? Ignorance of the
issue? Indifferencc to the issue?
'Purc laziness? Suit yourself, but
in the name of college spirit and
public spirit awake to the issue.
Get the habit of awaking early to
every issue that concerns you or
your country. Think, talk, and,
finally act. f-favc convictions and
have the courage to live up to them.
if you haven’t you're a public
corpse, '22.

 

 

A SUGGESTION

Two very interesting games of
inter-class basketball were played
in our College gym last week, but
the number of people who were
conspicuous by their absence was
very large. Without a doubt the
criticism that the men would get
because of their dcadness if they
did not play these games would
not come in small amounts. Since
the men cannot be accused of this
lack of class spirit, don’t you think
it , up to the girls to LLch tliciii ii
little backing? .

There was a schedule of these
nantcs published in the “News” a
couple of Weeks ago, Look up the
dates and plan to be present if pos—
sible. if your own team isn't play-
llltt‘, go just the saints. The larger
llic crowd, the better the men will
be able ‘to play, for in tlic cstiiiiatinii
of just so many more people will
they rise or tall as basketball ‘LIlJCII.

tees.

liclcii Walker, ’22. was toastniis-
tress of the evening. The first
number on the program was a solo
by Rutth Van Zandt, ’25, which was
directly followed by Eunice Rice’s
talk on the work of bile committee
members, llclcn Walker then
awarded the ribbons to the tliffcr~
cut committees—green bows to the
membership committee because it
is their duty to enlist freshmen in
Y. W. work; yellow bows to the
publicity committee because that
symbolizes the "yellow journal;"
blue and pink to bite social commits
tee for gaycty; silver gray to the
conference committee, as the color
symbolic of Silver Bay, and so on.
Miss Pierce spoke last, and her ad-
dress was followed by the Silver
Bay song. “Follow thchleam.” -

 

"To a king-lit in the days of old, .
Keeping watch on a mountain
height,
(lame ii vision of holy grail
And a voice through the waiting
night.
Saying 'li‘iillow, follow the gleam,
llannrrs unfurled over lllt‘ world;
liollow. follow, follow the gleam
Of the chalice that is the gi‘iiil.’

“And We who would serve the king,
Keeping watch here at Silver Bay,
in the consecratc silence know
That llll' challenge still lives lo-

ilay. ,
