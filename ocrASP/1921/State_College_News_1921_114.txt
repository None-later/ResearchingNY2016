TO THE PACIFIC IN
80 DAYS

By Dr. Gertrude E. Douglas

The animals of the parlc are quite
tame atul in addition to the indie-
Ines in the corral we had the good
fortune to see a hert of elk, a few
marumts, a coyote, a pelican and
several hears, The, latter frequent
ly stray into the tourists' camps,
and one rouple was st) afraid of
them that they piit‘ltctl their child-
ren's tent on top of their limousine!
These animals are unite tame, how-
ever. and it is usually possihlc to
see them at sundown at their feed-
ing grounds in the hotel garbage
pits. We watched a succession of
them one evening itt hack of the
Canyon time]. A little cinnamon
fellow was there when we arrived.
Soon a bigger hlack hear came
alongY and Little Cinnamon decided
that discretion was the greater part
of valor and sneaked away. Big

ered other claimants to the feast,
when two htth silver-tipped grizz-
lics stole in from the woods. An
argument started but Rig,r Black
Bear soon decided that it was not
wise to measure his strength against
the bigger grizzlics and followed
the worthy example of Little Cin-
