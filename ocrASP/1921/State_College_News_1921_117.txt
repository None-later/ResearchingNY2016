CO-ED?

 

;\'ow that the number of men at
State College has visibly increased,
we seem to have another problem
to overcome. Are we going to be
separated in two distinct groups in
our activities and college spirit as
well' ' assembly? The first evi-
(lcncc of any disscnsiuu occurred
when we discussed athletics in re»
gard to the budget. Some loyal
and alert students recognized the
trouble and came to the rescue.
Athletics are for all, not for the
boys only. lint besides this evl~
(lL‘llt'C \\’(' have what the sopho—
mores term the “general attitude."
Let‘s get over the “hnuiph” habit
in word or action every time State
College men are mentioned. This
resolve may apply to the men in
regard to the girls as well. it is
true that co-educatiou is spelled
with a hyphen, but let us do our
best to eradicate the hyphen anrd be

ARE YOU COURTEOUS?

It seems strange that we should
'have to speak of courtesy—just
common, ordinary, overyvday cour—
tesy—to college students. and yet
sometimes it would seem as if they
needed a lesson along this line
more. even. than high school fresh—
mcu.

Every once in a while we have
a most remarkable exhibition of
,the grossest kind of discourtesy,
annoying and interrupting a pro-
fcssor in his lectures. Of course
thumb: the temptation to whisper
when you cannot, hear, the tem -
ta'tlon to ask your nextdoor neig —
bor‘ what he'said,‘bnt; have you" ever
stopped to‘ consider that while you
are tr f,_ '20 find out'~the point. that
the ,‘lecturer ' has ,‘made. you are
losing themoin ’hat he is making,

and making the students around
you lose it, too ‘
“Lint I get so bored."~—-Well, to
be sure, that's a pity, but too
chances to one it’s your own fault.
You wouldn't be bored if you didn't
allow yourself to become bored.
And even if you are bored, that is
no excuse for you to be so discour—
teous as to immediately begin to
whisper. That is pure selﬁshness.
It will not be many years before
you will be a school teacher your-
self. Thcn, if one of your students
talks, you will order him to keep
still in no uncertain terms; you will
detnund that 'he Show this courtesy
to you as his teacher. The good
old golden rule still holds, “Do unto
others as you would have others do
unto you."

SILVER BAY VERSUS
COLLEGE CALENDAR

 

A couple of weeks ago an article
appeared in the "News" lamenting
the fact that our college year over-
lapped tbc dates of the Silver Bay
Conference. This made the .State
College representation very small
as compared with other colleges
which close earlier. We surely
want -onr college represented as
well as other colleges in intercol-
legiate affairs. Some colleges open
a week before State: so if the extra
week seems necessary. it might be
added to the beginning of our year.
Most people are about ready. t-ren
eager, to return to college after
Labor Day: whereas, no one would
regret the fact that college closet]
a week earlier than usual, liven if
we don‘t go to Silver Bay, we
would like to give other girls the
opportunity.

Set. ary l'lnghcs wrote to Presi-

necessity of removing the docu-
ments from the State Department.
and the President has signed an
executive order authorizing the
transfer.

State Department officials have
been worried often over the possible
fate of the Declaration and the '
stitution. Former Secretary Bain-
bridge Colby addressed a long
memorandum to Congress asking
for special steel ﬁreproof cases, but
his request was refused.

MINERVA MUSES

 

1 had a long chat with Minnie
one day last week. l‘oor woman,
she gets lonesome standing there in
the rotunda all day, watching "us
stttdes” rush past. but it gives her
lots of time for reﬂection. Now.
doesn’t it? Some fresh frosh once
remarked that Minnie was too
stupid to wash her own face, but
don’t be misled. Her face may in-
dirty, but her brain is clear. You
know Minnie's quite well known
around here; she's an impr‘taut
woman. There are two interesting
facts we ought to remember about
Minnie. She was never married,
She was the Goddess of Wisdom,
Now, don't jump at any conclusions
———don'tl l imply no connection be-
tween these two fztcts‘nrmc what—
ever.

However, as l was saying—«l
talked with Minnie quite a while
last Friday, and she unlmrdcned
her wisdom—weary mind to me
thusly: ,

Said slit‘, in her Rmnan manner,

“Long have 1 these halls of state
adm‘ncd——and long expect I' still
them to adorn.

“th never think i such a sight
again to see as this day wit-
nessed i."

She paused—while l' was all agog
to hear the rest——

Perhaps some man and maiden

did you see? .
for answer' came—“A portly
professor. then. saw l with tray in

 

lionlf Scullioull'?’
