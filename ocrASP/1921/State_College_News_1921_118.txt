{1”— How Do Hot Things Cool?
\ \
\ \ \
\ HE blacksmith draws a white-hot bar from the forge.

It begins at once to cool. How does it lose its heat?

Some is radiated. as heat is radiated by the sun; but
some is carried away by the surrounding air. Now suppose
the bar to be only one-half the diameter; in that case it loses
heat only half as fast. Smaller bars lose in proportion. It
would seem that this proportion should hold, however much
the scale is reduced. But does it? Does a ﬁne glowing wrre
lose heat in proportion to its diminished size?

The Research Laboratories of the General Electric
Company began a purely scientiﬁc investigation to ascertain
just how fast a glowing wire loses heat. It was found that
for small bodies the old simple law did not hold at all. A
hot wire .010 in. diameter dissipates heat only about 12 per
cent more rapidly than a wire .005 in. diameter instead of
twice as fast as might be expected.

The new fact does not appear very important, yet it
helped bring about a revolution in lighting.

It had been found that a heated ﬁlament in a vacuum
evaporated like water and that this evaporation. could be
retarded by introducing an inert gas such as nitrogen or
argon. But it had long been known that the presence of gas
in the ordinary incandescent lamp caused so much heat to
be carried from the ﬁlament that the lamp was made use-
less. The new understanding of the laws of heat from wires,
however, pointed out a way of avoiding the supposed necessity
of a vacuum.

By forming the ﬁne tungsten ﬁlament into a heliir the
heat loss was made much less prominent. The light radiated
is then about the same as if the wire were stretched out, but
the heat loss through the gas is very much less. So the
tightly coiled ﬁlament was put into the gas-ﬁlled bulb——
and a new lamp was created. At the same cost it gave more
and better light.

Thus pure research, conducted primarily to ﬁnd out
how hot things cool, led to the invention of thegas-ﬁlled lamp
of today—~the cheapest, most efﬁcient illuminant thus far
produced.

Sooner or later research in pure science enriches the
world with discoveries that can be practically applied: For
this reason the Research Laboratories devote much time to
the study of purely scientiﬁc problems.
