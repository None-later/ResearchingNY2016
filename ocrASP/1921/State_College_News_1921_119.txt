Well, she org-led me with her eyes
for about ten minutes till 1 got 59
unoumfortablc I, had to change my

is my family motto. ,

When I got in N Yawk l was
surprised that nobody knew my old
man & I near had a hemrag‘c when
no one even heard of him. I went
into a drug store & the teller there
told the to look in one of these tele-
phone books with only the street
numbers & I found the name.

to go up on the elevator so I (lid.
As we was rushihg‘ by thirty third

St first thing I knew I was under-
ground overgronnd & underground
again. I near hollcred uhc lirst
couple of times I was so scared but
when I seen all the city doods look~
ing at me sort of funny, I says to
myself, I) old top you gotta
show theses city tellers that you
ain't no liacluvoodsman. Cousc—
quent I pulled out a cigarette & tho
it made me pnrty sick smoked it
with my feet up by the collar of the
man ahead. (ice, I wished the folks
at old S. C. T. could of sccn Inc. l

huddy knew I was ever from

Well the fcllcr in the uniform let
me off somewhere near the end of
Long- lsland called the llroux & I
started walkint.r across the street.
Suddenly sonictlliug‘ hit up- an unw-
ful whack & for a minute I that our
old bull had whacked me an awful
whack bnt'it was only a taxicab.
.‘\s I was sprawled out on the cur-
Iine a fuller rushed up & said “Arc
you hurt? Wall, I says. l guess it
Iain't done me no good!" TIIL‘III
