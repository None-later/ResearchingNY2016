“JOLLY JUNIORS ”

Witt" oh \vh 'c, are the "Jolly
.luniors.’ " Well, they have been hav»
tug one round of good times and
fun. and showing State what a lot
of “pep” they’ve got. They went
into 'atus. with a zeal which lie rly
surpassed any of the other class s,
and then they were off to make
Junior week-end the best ever. They
were at the l’ost-l‘ am, Jubilee in
full force and heh d to make Ulllt,‘
of the noise whiclt was so prevalent
there. Then on 'l‘husday night they
did something quite out of thc ordi-
nary and llt'lUUk themselves to the
Hampton where they ate as no other
junior cIaSs ever ate. And last, but
ttot least, they went to their own
Prom, which was the best l'rotn
State has ever seen. On Saturday
nigllt they liuishcd up a busy week by
going to the Alumni State game and
the dancing afterwards, :\nd this
week they're all back at college,
just as full of “pep” as ever—if
not more so. They’re all ready to
start the second semester even hctter
than the first and show their :\|ma
Mater what they can do.

,lsn't 1922 the best junior class
ever?

Where, oh where, are the “ Jolly

Juniors ?”

   

   

 

    

A CHALLENGE

This is the beginning Week of the
second semester, lt is a week
which brings a challenge for every
student in college, Exams are over,
and there is the temptation to lie
down on the job until another
"crammng season." However, let
us all make “new-semester" reso-
lutions: to prepare our work daily,
to put ourselves into our work, and
to be alert to the many educational
possibilities of the curriculum.
Neither must we allow ourselves to
be"‘swallowcd up " by our desire
for learning. There are the social
functions which must be supported.
No one cares for “ the grind" any
more than he cares for the frivolous
“gad-about." The frosh can now
become more enthusiastic over
their prospective success now that

.

 

the effects of the first terrible
“reign of terror " have “ almost "
vanished, and we give the seniors
their one last chance to contribute
the ry best that is in them to
their Alma Mater. The sophs are
egotistical, and the juniors are gay
accordingr to tradition, but they will
expend their energy in making this
a live institution. .‘\t the end of
this, a successful year, may we all
be able to shout: llurrah for State
('ollegel

 

ANOTHER "DON’T"

We are proud of our Alma Mater,
aren't we?

\'\"e have lots of college spirit
llt'l'C at State, loo, haven't we?

And we know that there i
better place to display this spi
than at a basketball game, don't

no
rt!

‘0.
Well, then, cheer as lhough you
meant it, and when the hall does a
neat little turn around the edge ol
the basket and doesn’t go in, don't
groan!

POST—EXAM JUBILEE
Continued from l’ng‘c l
attended by a very tuiprt'ciativc and

appropriate audience.

This scene was in deep contrast to
the following ones when the orches
tra took their st t.'. and the gather
; nbled about them to watch
the class stunts.

The seniors showed in a striking
manner the c. rccr of a girl through
her college cour . How well they
pictured to us lllt' “hua‘hc rs " of
rach successive year! The finsh put
up a hard struggle with required
courses. History ll and Mathematics
1 proved almost fatal, but [English 1
came along to save her from the sc-
verc initiation, lireese's sophomore
psychology and Painter's little child
had to be encountered during the
second year. The junior struggled
with I'Cquircd education and methods.
The senior battled incessantly with
practice teaching; which forever fol-
lowed lu-r about. Not even little
green hugology. the senior's friend,
who had remained with her front her
freshman year. could separate the
pest from her. The senior bravely
passed through a course in higher
education and psychology till gradu-
ation finally seized and threw her 0111
to battle in the world.

The juniors presented a tragedy.
The whole scene was very dramatic,
Court was held and we experienced
the trial and cxccltlinn of Frank

 

 

 

 

 

 

Pierpont (iraves, William Billings
Aspiuwald, and liaitlt l'lope Disap-
pointment. (.iravcs was convicted
and pleaded guilty of writing "A
Student’s History of Education,"
and Aspinwald was convicted and
pleaded guilty of writing “Outlines
of the History of I‘lducation." Dis-
appointment was convicted and
pleaded guilty of the crime of being
the sixth J’rotn. man to desert one
hopeful junior girl. The three cab-
bage heads were scvvred and the
judge and executioners took part in

c h nlarch about the v'
‘ophomorc stunt was sue 5»
int in ‘auntsi'ng the audience. .\
freshman and sophomore, upon cu-
lcriug the Dean's oilice to obtain
their marks, were cmnpletely dazed
to learn that they were to take an»
nllun‘ lest, Dr. I. ls'uowthenuts, from
the Slate .\sy|um, had comt‘ to c.\'~
amine the students. The frosh and
sophomore were put through very
strenuous intelligence tests. 'l‘hcir
marks were then given out, One .4
was given to the sophomore: four
lf'r went to the sopllotllOl‘t‘; two C’s,
three IJ'r. and one I" wcnt to the
freshman. 'l'he " appeared in
groups. and were exhibited by study,
song', dance. comedy. and mourning,
rc )ectivcly,

The frcsluucn gave the winning
stunt. Tin-y rlmn-r ' staged two [cc-
' t5 famous Wed—

c, s llistory ll lecture.
The class showed rctuurlt'ahh- skill in
impersonation not only, but l'('.'ttllllt"s<
to respond to the iudrut‘tion derived
from the lectures, \Vt' foretell for
them a hr, hi and prosperous future.
