ANENT AN ABODE

__

One of the vital problems of the
student who enters an institution
of learning at some little distance
from the paternal abode is to dis-
cover a suitable place in which to
sojourn sometimes when sleep is
imperative. or a stocking must bv
darned. or there is nothing else
to do. and nnwhcrre else to so.
We are all familiar with th: diffi-
culty of getting located in a place
that is convenient to the college.
not too absolutely deficient in
modern improvements. nor too big
a drain on llhe pa‘ter’s bank ac-
count it is a problem and a seri-
ous one here at State. We wonder
it somewhere. somehow, we can—
not start something that will lead
to a couple of dormitories, or at
least to a serious consideration hr
the powers that be of the necessity
for some housingr plan that will he
more comfortable than the present
one of taking what we can get.
whether we really like it or not.
Are not dormitories the most suc-
cessful and interesting homes for
college students? Are we suffi-
ciently interested to get behind
this idea and try to work it out so
as to accomplish something. if not
for ourselves. for those who will
follow us?

CAMPUS DAY DEMANDS
FRESHMAN INTEREST

Dear freshman. if you have never
heard or thought of ‘Campus Day.
lend a willing car now. Do you
realize that one-quarter of Campus
Day is meant for you, and that a
big share of your college future de-
pends on it. All the upper-class
men come out for it and if. in look-
ing over ‘the crowd. they miss
Your {25 button, you will he as
nothing in their eyes. You will
never be noticed. The list of
events‘ is not merely posted to he

  

 

looked at. but to he entered into;
It is your place to try out and
show what spirit and love of fun
you have by signing up for as
many events as you can manage.
Campus Day is the one big con-
centrated expression of college
spirit which will mean more to you
in after years than an A in His-
tory .
Don't be among the missinng‘

A rowing WORD
ON SILVER BAY

i am not among those who go
to Silver Bay, but i agree most
heartily with the writer" of last
week's editorial, We do want as
large a representation there as any
other college, lll' proximity has
any part in determining the num-
ber of delegates that a college
sends we should have more than
almost any other college, for we
rank among the first in ncarncss
to Lake George. We are fifty
miles nearer than Vassar. a thun-
dred miles nearer than Wellcslcy
or liaruard. it is at these large
conventions that we meet the
other colleges and gain fa-
miliar intercourse with them. And
what is more, every college of any
size is there, too. is State Collch
to be represented as well as the
others, are our delegates to be
there on time? lint how can this
be done if we do not close until
(lite Students' Conference at Silver
liay is over?

SAY SOMETHING

Girls:—

Arc we tlSlt'Cll or are we going to
let our eighty or eighty-live State
l'ollcge men conduct all our legis-
lation? We cannot afford to take
a back seat. When asked why she
didn't get up in chapel and voicv
lu-r opinions one of us has said:
"They didn’t give us a chance.”
We ‘have the some chance as the
mcn do to say something. if we
live hundred or more can't show
more CUliCIYL‘ spirit. we ought to be
ashatncd of ourselves! Upper class-
men and sophomore girls, show the
freshmen that we're on the map.
Ve talk enough around the halls.
Why get bashful the minute chapel
is called on l’riday? When you
have something worth while to say.
stand up. address the chair. and say
it. Do not turn to your neighbor
and mumhle something. We have
a chance only once a week. Never
miss an opportunity,

We shall not take an antagonistic
attitude toward our men at State
College. We merely want :1 tier
mocracy. ‘23

THE FRENCH RESTORA—
TION FUND

The following is a portion of a
letter which Dr. Brubachcr received
from John Erskine. chairman of the
university committee for the
French Restoration Fund. inc:

“it is now proposed that our4

college and university students
join in contributing a fund for the
rebuilding of the 'Univcrsite Du
Travail’ at Lille, which will be a
popular technical institute to teach
all arts and crafts: and we hope
that your institution will approve
of the‘ plan and take part in it.
We do not wish to suggest a drive
or an appeal for charity; we hope
merely that the- youngr linen and
women in our colleges and univers-
ities. mindful of the distress of
Europe and remembering the gen-

 

erous hospitality bestowed upon
our soldier-students in the French
universities durinr the armistice,
will take this practical way of show-
ing our good will toward the young
men and women of France for
whom the war still means a loss
of educational opportunit .”

The students of State College are
asked to bring contributions for
this .fund to Assembly next Friday.

MORE WORKl YE GODS,
MORE WORK!

Wantt-d.——.»\ few millions of tlll‘
conditional Amcnicau citizens. men
and women. who are for the U. S.
lirst. last. and all the time.

I wonder if such an advertise—
ment could fail 'to catch the in-
terest of a prospective teacher.
Assuming that it could not, let us
consider it a moment Teachers
are. or should be. to a large ex—
tent thc chief factor in determin-
ing the kind of citizens [bat the
coming generations will be. Sucir
influence as may be theirs should
be directed toward making.r uncon-
ditional Americans of their pupils.

For the nexd few years we shall
have for our pupils boys and girls
who are growing up in an atmo+
phcre of scilish (lesil‘t's—slrikr's.

promote the interests of self. re-
gardless of neigihbor. state or
country. .\re we going to take
cognizance of llllc inevitable effect
oflthis spirit upon the coming gun—
cratiou and do what we can to
imbue our pupils with a spirit of
co-opcrativc patriotism and instill
in them a few grains of common
sense.

Just to show the importance of
this, let us consider a single in~
stance of the effect of this c-tcrnal
wrangling over wages. prolits and
transportation charges upon the
(‘xpurt trade of our country. Much
of our national prosperity is due to
our ability to market our products
and manufactures in foreign coun-
tries. South America is one of
the natural tnarklc‘ts for our prod-
ucts. Should we. then. not be
alarmed Ito note that during two
months of this year as compared
with the same two tnotvths of last
year. our South American trade
alone fell off $69.00!].000. (Inc to our-
inabilitv to compete with the prices
of German commodities? Nor i
this market the only one to be af-
fected. Think it over and out.
to promote a spirit of co-opera-
tion for national prosperity.

LECTURE ON ETCHINGS

“ 'l'he Appreciation of Etchings "
was the subject of a lecture given
by Miss. Perine in the Auditorium
last ’l‘hursday evening. The lecture
was accompanied by lantern slide
illustrations. it is regretted that
more of the studentscould not have
been there to receive the valuable
information concerning the pro-
cess of etchings.

few " pen and ink" slides were
given to show the character of
the tolls and the different back-
grounds used in etching. The vari—
ous technical terms, mosotint. aqua-
tint. soft ground etc-hing, dry point,
blank lDOillt. eighth century etch-
ings. and tones were delightfully
explained and illustrated.

The wonderful works of Louis
()rr were shown. it is known that
many of his works have been pur-
chased by the French government.
Since the war ‘lte has been com-
missioned by the gow'rument to
etch eminent cathedrals.

Orr has become wcll known
abroad btc. lse of the works.

Another interesting picture which
we saw was the first lithograph
cvcr printed in the United States.
This appeared in a magazine pub-
lishrd in Philadelphia when Wash-
ington lrving was editor of the
magazine.

liy comparing the various prints
the audience was acquainted with
the methods used by the artists——
how they made their works effec-
tive, and how much their person-
ality went into the making of a
good picture. ’ aid that the

artists derive a great (Pill of pleas-
ure In this more personal form of

The talk put the student in a
position to enjoy with a new vision
the prints in the rotunda. giving him

the ability to appreciate and judgv'

certain things. After becoming ac-
quainted with the style of an artist.
n was possible to go into the ro-
tunda and recognize other works
by the same artts. An artist’s
works are just as characteristic of
him as a person's handwriting is
characteristic of him.

All students are invited to come
to the exhibition in the rotunda and
be able to appreciate it intelligently
