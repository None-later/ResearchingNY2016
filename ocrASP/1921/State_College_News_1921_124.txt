meal into round cakes of bread.
The man has just rcttvrncd from
tishing and is ready to lunch.

The next group shows some of
the industries that engage the busy
red-man. Sheltered in a shady
oak-grove, the entertainer is an
arrow-maker, and while he tells his
amusing Itale, as the chips the limits,
one woman weaves a basket, an-
other is working out the design on
a beaded 'belt. In a corner of the
grove vthc potter moulds this clay.
With his sharp-edged instrument
the wood-carver shapes a bowl, and
beside the pool the maiden sews
her moccasins.

The false-face ceremony is de-
pccted yin tthe vthird setting. Is it
not a wicrd scene? However, con-
trary ito appearances, the masked-
men convey good-cheer, for they
are performing the traditional
mid-winter purilication rile. 'l‘hcsc
grotesquely clad lndians have
burs-t into this cabin, throwing
wide the doors and windows. The
medicine-man follows the young
girl. blowing white ashes throngih
his ﬁngers upon ‘her head. An-
other intruder scatters ashes upon
the hearth and kindlcs a new tire,
while a horribly masked dancer
begs a reward of a pipe bowl of
tobacco front the Frigthtened lad.

The cabin is comiortalﬂy lur-
nishcd and its occupants are well-
clot‘hed. representing the period
when the New York Indian had
trader's clo'th and itools.

(As conferences are in vogue to-
day so the Indian resorted to vari-
ous councils.) The Turtle Clan
chicis have assembled in tilte bark
lodge of their Firckcepcr to discuss
a tribal subject. The interior is
extremely ‘bare. The presence oi
the lone Indian woman excmplilics
the privilege that the Iroquois
woman possessed—~bhe right to
voice her opinions in all councils
of the nation. Sihc tears that .the
council’s action is adverse to her

. interests and is asking her spokes—
man to interccde' f r her.

On this thill. over coking the pic~
turesque Mohawk and facing the
Adirondack ’foo‘tthills. appears an
advance parity of Moha‘wk‘ warriors;
notedrior‘their cruel wirfare; ‘Onc

ing up the hill holds Ollil; a string

at the right, represent a portion

wall. A Mohawk dbief, in (full war
regaliia, leads a prisoner, while in
the background, anotltor ludian
motions more warriors Ito a hilltop
council.

This is atypical Seneca fannin
gathered about: lltc 'yard ol its
hunting-lodge. Over the door of
the cabin protrudes an animal's
head, and a illtlgc black bearskin
serves as a door. The old father
is just returning from the (hunt
with illlL‘ body of a lawn slung over
his shoulders. The mother, who is
skiving a dccrskin, and the daugh-
ter. who has been cutting strips
of venison to be sun-dried, look up
from their tasks to see wlhat luck

ground one son is practicing his

REPORT ON ARMS CONFERENCE
(Continued from Page 1.)
met-ting, showing the incstiumblc
disasters caused by wars. The
United States alono spends llll]L‘l)'-
three per cent of its taxes cithcl‘
paying for illtlSl wars or in prepar-
ing for future wars. The tax on
tobacco alone would pay all the
civil expenses of the country. After
it wtts decided that the resolutions
of the conference should be made
general. rather than schillC. the
liar Eastern question was discussed.
it was decided that something must
be done by the international cou-
fercncc to settle this question he-
cuusc it is'thu our part of the peace
treaty in which there is cause for

future wars.

:\ decision was made to have a
permanent organization of the
northeastern colleges. J. A, Flynn
of Columbia, was appointed secrcA
tary of the executive board of this
organization, which can succeed
only with the cooperation of all
the colleges. it was also decided
that men only were eligible.

A banquet followed the business
meeting. At this lime the resolu-
tions were read. adopted and
signed. After the banquet the dele~
gates were addressed in Alexander
hall by four spcaltcrs,— Colonel
D’Olier who fought in the Spanish
American war, General O’Ryan of
the World war, Vernon Kelloggr
or active worker in lielgiau and
Russian relief work, and Dwight
Morrow.

The conference was closed by
President Hiban who said, 4“ The
day has come when each must learn
how nation may live with nation
in mutual understanding and in
permanent peace.”

And he never can; t a bite,
But when someone brou ht a “Pad”
He was soon console , all right.
