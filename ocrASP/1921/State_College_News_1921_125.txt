music.

Students will ‘be admitted on tip-Er

dent of this city. The faculty of
the Colch are cordially invited to

The names of November 7 and
9 resulted in a victory for the senior
and sophomore girls. The seniors
played against the juniors. and the
sophomores against the freshmen.
'l‘be juniors put up a good fight.
but could do nothing against the
superior playing of the seniors.
The ﬁnal score was 27 to 6.

ln the second of the girls’ inter—
class basketball games between the
sophomores and freshmen, the
freshmen showed the promise of a
line team. They are. well trained.
and their passwork is well worthy
of commendation. The slight over—
confidence of the sophomores in
the first half allowed the frosh to
lead by a score of 7-3. but in the
last half the spectacular shooting
of Billy ‘l‘lcinetnaa saved the game
for the sophomores. The game
was closely contested throughout.
and both teams appreciated the
support from the side lines.
