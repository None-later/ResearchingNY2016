INNOCUOUS PERSIFLAGE

“Silence is golden and a closed
mouth catches no llics"——neverthc-
less we must talk; if we didn't, Wt:
lli'\'l‘l‘ wonhl say anything. Some
of us talk from force of habit,
others because we 'have something:
to say. .\lost of us talk a little, and
sooner or later we all are guilty of
indulging in innocuous pcrsitlatzc.
it is good e.', 'e for the vocal
organs and a ple. s'
brain. We are not infrequently
drawn ou— iron :1 fair listener as
an incentin to trivu loose rein to
our imaginativr faculties, with the
result that the harmless small talk
becomes at times rank prevarica-
tion. To this, even, there is no
real serious objection, for most
everybody loves a cheerful liar. But
here is the rubl

Sometimes a statement made in-
advertently, or jokingly, as between
friends, comes to the ears—we
won't mention their excessive
length—of one who sees [it to use
said bit of information in order to
slam" one of his of -her dearest
friends. Alas, the thoughtlessncss
of the unthinking! Feelings are
hurt, hair is ptillcd, amt “call-
downs" are handed out gratis and
promiscuously. Eventually the hor-
ribly disfigured statement comes
back to its author, who. not in the
least recognizing it, promptly dis-
owns it. Then the chaotic storm
begins anew. and some bright
cynic proudly proclaims that “all
men are liars." Well, so they are,
but wh" advertise it?

We know that discreet silence is
humanly impossible. We do not
advocate a restriction of innocuous
persillage. But. if we are of those
who like to have somethingr on the
other fellow, let us look farther
than the mischief of the moment
and consider the possible conse—
quences to non-combatants. if we
must repeat let us be as parrot—like
as possible and stick to the original
form of the original statement.22

APPLY LOYALTY

 

There are so many people with
high school minds in State College
that high school tactics need no be
employed. Must we have faculty
police patrolling our aisles in as
senibly Friday morning to enforce
loyalty to Alma Mater? The pro-
cession out of assembly during its
meetings in the last two weeks
proves [halt the loyalty we, have
for Alma Mater does not even ex~
lend to courtesy. Of course, the
loyalty of the students who wish
to hear the speeches in assembly
is not of enouin valilc do he ron—
sidcrrd by those who are willin:
to enjoy pleasures, but are un--
willing to work for the pleasures.
Of course the main purpose in
having: a senior presiding in sun
dent assmubly i to try out tIhe
stunit of "stickil teacher" accord-
ini,r to Milne 5h devices And
equally taken for granted is the
fact that all ‘of our men who prac-
tice. those (lL‘Vit'CS know parliamen—
tary law so well and have so much
poise 'that they would be. irre-
proachable as presiding otlieers.

'l'he sue ‘ of our student as-
semblies depends on loyalty and
courtesy. Whatever student of
State '(‘olleizc is unwilling to aid
in llllt' improvement of our vul-
legc is t‘llllt'l‘ too dliildisli to be
here or ion stingy of his time to
nay a lillllt‘ of the debt he owes
State College.

To be loyal, we must know what
is inning: on in student assemblies
if some students prefer .'\llllll
.\later as a legal guardian inst ill
of our edlit‘.’iiioual mother. let tlir-m
deal with her in their courts; hut
ll'l viii-m not attempt the rxtimu
tioii of loyal love to Alma Mater
in those who are interested in her

welfare.

READING

Someone has said. "Tell me
what you read in college, and i
will it‘ll you what kind of edi '-
lioii you have." Let this be * it
may. \\'(- must recognize the tact
that reading: that is done from
“N y, and especially that
which is done from choice exerts
a great inflneiirt- on the intellec-
iual thouuht of the reader.

We. as college people. trust tba‘
we have started upon the task of
becoming t'tlncuit‘rl. lidtiration
aims to give men a broader view
of life, a broader field upon whirli
to meet other men. and, in the last
analysis. to give men the spirit of
true understanding. \Ve cannot
expect to gain an ideal education
from books alone. Education. ll‘tl'
"lit's years of careful thought and
lllt‘clillﬂs‘ with all kinds of people,
in our college years. however, we
niav meet inyi'iads of people who
will be glad to start us right on
the. road to true education. We
can read the old masters who are
really not dry-asulnst after all. for
they did think and wonder even
as we do. Then we can make
the acquaintance of the thinkers of
our own time whose work is con-
tained in our ncwt‘r books and
periodicals. \Vc cannot find all the
answers to the many problems
that present themselves in books,
of course, but books, like true
friends, give us somethingr to
start on. “Io know what has been
done. what has been thought. and
we may go on from here niakinar
use of their tliscoveries and avoid—
ing their mistakes.

How much time can you steal
from required readingr and neces-
sary recreation to broaden out on

    

 

 

lines you ﬁnd yourself at sea upon,

so that you inny say, as a truly

educated person, some day: "Noth-
. ..

ini,r human is loreign to me.

BOBBED HAIR—
PRO AND CON

:\s the time goes faster and faster
and feminine members of colleges
grow older and older, every girl
arrives sooner or later at the point
when she has to decide for or
against bobbing her hair. It takes
such a short time to fling hair into
place. and one looks so much
younger—if the hair is short.
Susie goes home Friday night. tired
to death and looking, ()h. at least
twenty-six. Monday mornng she
arrives at an eight-ten : how-
ever. fresh as the overworked rose
and looking sixteen years old if a
day. Gladys sees Susie, has a
thought. and the next Monday
morningr Gladys, is transformed,
and so on and on until all the
toiletri- girls have bobbed heads:
until some cannot be told from high
school people: until some suddenly
become the best lookingr things, and
until some lose that worried and
downtrodden twenty-six year old
look.

Ilou'ever, the time comes when
positions must be secured by
troubled seniors. it is rumored
that bobbed hair is the one thing;
upon which certain unreasonable
superintendents will not com-
irriulvisu'. Susie writes an applica-
tion. sends a picture, aml is refused.
siuwrinti-mlent asks to .u
(iladys. but the short hair is all he
wants to know of her when she
mines to the office. He wants dig-
nity and capability and a certain
amount of efficiency to character e
[be appi-ar.’inre of the teacher he 5r»
rnri's. llr runlides to his faliiily on
his return thal he had a vague fer-b
lllL: that Gladys was not the type of
person to wear bobbed hair, any—
how. Her face was too large, or
:toilll'lliiiizz. ;\nd (iladys and the
remainder of the s not included
in the "same" art saddened by the
Ihounht that they possess a rr'r»
lain iueonu‘rnity of looks because
their hair is not long. no i wan'
short hair or not?

Dear Louie,

5.1 Louie, i want a tell you

Well. it's it kinda “heavy” subjeck
