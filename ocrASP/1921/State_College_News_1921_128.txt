tlte problem in 1878. For a year.
lte experimented,making an ocea-
sional forward stop.

He thought *a carbon thread
would make tlte best filament. But
it had to operate in a more nearly
perfect vacuum than any obtainable
at the time. So he built a superior
ptuup to secure such a vacuum.
Then he struggled for weeks to ﬁnd
the right sort of‘material to carbon—
iae into a tilament, using,r bamboo.
eottou thread, and linally cardboard
paper. '

Having made his line lilament,
atnl secured a stilliciently high
vacuum on which it might operate
inside a glass ltnlh, l’ltu next dill]-
cnlty was to get the filament sealed
inside the bulb. The connection
between tlte tilameut and the cur-
rent wire outside the bulb had to be
made of some material that would
expand and contract at the same
rate as glass in order that the glass
would not crack. llc produced an
alloy of platitnun and iridittm which
filled this need.

Then the lirst I‘Cdisou lamp was
tnade October 21, 1879. When it
was attached for a trial. employees
in the lidisott laboratories at hlettlo
Park. N- l. wagered ' dly over
the number of minutes it. would
burn belore the fragile lilament
broke. lt burned 45 hours. Mr.
Edison knew he had succeeded.

Since then other epoch making
imprtwetnehts have been made in
the incandescent lamp. Dr, W. l).
Coolidge of the General Electric Co.
in 1910 discovered how it.) make
tungsten, that brittlcst of all metals.
ductile so it could be drawn out into
tilament of any size ranging down
to a gauge six times liner titan
human hair and tougher than any
known substance for lamp use, The
tungsten lamp then replaced the far
less efticient carbon lamp,

A few years ago Dr, Irving Lang-
m‘nir discovered that if lamp bulbs
were lilled with argon, one of the
most inert gases in our atn‘tnsphet'c.
the tungsten filament would operate
at even higher temperatures with
even longer life. This resulted in
the gas-tilled lamp which. in vari-
ous forms, is one of the highest
products of electric lamp makers
to-rlay.

Thus. one thingr and then another
has been tried by experimenters in
lamps just as prehistoric man made
his crude efforts in his own behalf.
Constant research has given man a
better and better lamp so that the
most modern ones among the more
than four hundred million which
glow every 24 hours all around the
world, are giving eight times as
much light for a given input oi,
current as Mr. Edison’s original
lamps. and the cost of lighting in
1919 was but three per cent of the
cost in 188].

Dean, New York State College for

ltotary Club,

 

Abraham Lincoln once wrote his
stepbrother, a shiftlcss fellow. who
never learned how to settle down to
steady work: "lf you intend to go
to work, there is no better place
than right where you are; if you
do not intend to go to work, you
cannot not alone: anywhere.”

here is no secret or mystery
about success. Work, just plain,
hard WOrk is its beginning, Some
people spend their lives chasing the
pot of gold that is said to be at the
foot of the rainbow. Others watch
constantly for the expected bend in
the road that is to bring them good
fortune. Still others sit idly by the
seaside of life and wait for a ship
to come in. Fortunately for the
progress of civilization, there are
others who take off their coats, roll
up their sleeves, and go to work at
the ﬁrst task that comes to hand.

They are the ones who do the
construction work of the world.
Boys and girls will ﬁnd. of course,
that many things count in success;
but work is the foundation. And a
determination to work bravely and
honestly at the job one ﬁnds before
him to-day is the best proof of his
ability to handle a more difﬁcult
task to-morrow. This is just as true
in getting lessons, in running er—
rands, or in doing chores around
home as it is in later life, in writing
a hook, in building a railroadhin

' pleading a law case, or in managing

a business. Diligence in the day‘s

work is the primary promise of a

successful life work.
