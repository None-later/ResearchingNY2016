State to which we can return.

A PROPHECY AND
ITS FULFILLMENT

"Then let us pray that come it
may—

As come it will for a’ that——

That sense and worth, o’er a' the
earth,

.\la,v bear the gree, and a‘ that;

For a' that, and a’ that,

That man to man, the world o’er,

Shall brithcrs be for a' thatl"

And on November ll delegates
from all the great civilized nations
of the world met in conference at
Washington to discuss the ques—
tion of the limitation of the vast
armaments oi the various powers,
and such limitation of armaments
is the first great step toward the
elimination of all possibility of
great wars in the future. Will that
step be taken in the near future?
There can be little doubt but that
all of the thinking, progressive in-
dividuals of all the nations of the
world are hoping against hope that
it will be taken. Yet many of us
who acknowledge the hope are
conscious of a strange hesitancy, a
veritable lack of enthusiasm. when
We face the issue of actually relax-
ing our‘nation's attitude of pre~
paredness and allowing our light-
ing strength to be diverted into
other'channels. Why? Certainly
not because we want war. It is
universally conceded that war is
abominable, impractical, useless;
that another war in this day and

 

age would be so far-reaching in its
dire consequences as to frighlen
the most reckless of us into an
earnest desire to avoid it. Nor
can it be that we harbor any very
potent distrust of the other nu-
tions concerned, for we are all in
one and the same boat. Is it not,
perhaps, that we SL'llSC instinctiver
—rather than actively consider——
the broader issue embodied in the
proposition of limitation of arma-
ments, of cessation of all wars, of
amicable settlement of all contro-
versies. tlle tmiversal brotherhood
of man? We are imbued with the
spirit of conservatism, of our na-
tion's individuality, are conscious.
as Americans, of our power. our
ability, and there is a natural con-
llict of ideals as we rise to this new
proposition. We must play the old
game under new rules; must put
our shoulder to the wheel, and
push for universal rather than na-
tional welfare. '22.

HOW ABOUT IT.
FRESHMEN?

0h, frosli, why did you do it?
it surely could not have been pre-
incdilatedl ‘\'Vc mcnn the outrage
dom- Minerva on Campus Day.
Don’t you remember the getrrwisc
meeting? Why do you suppose
that lirst, before taking you through
so much fear-inspiring experience,
we made you bend the knee before
Minerva? Are you so green that you
don't know even now what Min-
crva symbolir "‘ Minerva sym-
bolixcs college irit; so you bent
your knee to college spirit. Allcr
that you should have supported
college spirit as was becoming so-
phisticated freshmen. .Instead, on
liriday you cattle with your tawdry
streamers and wrapped them about
our patron; you smndgcd her face
and hands with crimson; you
nearly toppled her over in your
mad surging. brush, what were
you thinking about! Does Slate
mean nothing,r to you? Then you
rushed the front door knowing that
the front door rule is a tradition.
\on did it to pick a light with the
sophomores. You paid them a- big
compliment in expecting them to
seek vengeance for such wholesale
llannting at traditions. llnl how
about that kind of class spirit?
Did you enjoy that riot in the
rotunda? Do‘you cxnlt over your
exploit? it is time you realize that
there is a collch spirit that should
be held inviolalc. The class of ’24
is back of it. Are you going to re-
fuse to boost that spirit just be—
cause the sophs are trying to boost
it? If in trying to flaunt them you
smash through traditions and dis—
regard college spirit you are faster—
ing that kind of class spirit which
must not exist in State.
Now come on. '25, be sportsman-
likc, college-spirited frcshmcny!7

IN GREAT DEMAND

1\ superinlcmlcnl of a New York
State hiin school callcd Dr. lrn—
bacbcr on the telephone one day
and said that be needed a ncw
teacher for a certain subject. He
wanted no (Mic but a State College
graduate if he could get one. "if
you have one who is qualiﬁed for
the position, please send her down
immediately."

Dr. lirnbacbet' answered that he
had a teacher for the position. A
girl was sent who proved a success-
ful and satisfactory teacher. This
illustrates the way in which State
College graduates get positions.
There are a large number of su—
ncrintcndents in New York State
who alwavs come here or a
hl'ﬂcl'lt‘l‘ before they look anywhere
C so.

The demand for our teachers is
greater than we can satisfy. lunch
year about ninety per cent. oli'th'e
graduating class secure pasinons
as teachers. Of con . , there is al-
ways a small percentage of a class
who get below seventy per cent.
in practice teaching. The appoint-
ment bureau cannot recommend
these people except for certain po-
sitions which they can fill ade-
quately, but many of them are
placed through agencies. Students
having a grade over seventy-live
and willing to teach in any part of
the State could usually be placed
twice over. Only six members of
last year's class were unable to se-
curc positions, and some of these
failed because they did not wish to
teach away from home.

New York State Collch gradn~
ates are teaching in every county
in the State. A larger percentage
is found in the eastern than in the
western part: for every one lum—
tired cast of Syracuse there are
about ten west.‘ A great number of
State College people lunch in the
Hudson valley, especially near New
York 'Cily. New Jersey has n gt 1
many of our teachers. The higher
s; i paid -in the Metropolitan
District draw them there.
