ORGAN IZA TIONS

 

 

 

French Club

lirench Club held its first initia-
tion party Saturday afternoon, thus
teaching the freshmen a few things
about French that they never knew
before. It was all decidedly inter-
esting for everyone there.

Plans for the Fete to he held
December 2 are well under way.
and so far the liete promises to bc
a great success. Get your ticket
now, from any one of the French
Club members.

Fun Club

Forty—ﬁve students have now
joined Press -Club. Sign up and
help make the meetings Successful.

A regular business meeting was
held Wednesday. Miss Murray
. The next meeting will be
Dec. 14. The speaker will be an-
nounced later.

 

N H, Club

Chemistry -Club was fortunate in
having,r Doctor Douglas, of the
Biology Department, talk about her
western trip at their last regular
meeting of the club Wednesday
evening. November 15, at 7:30
o‘clock.

Many slides, nearly all of which
were snapshots taken by Doctor
Douglas herself, were shown.
Those who were present saw pic-
tures of the places Dr. Douglas so
vividly described in the News. Only
a few of the more interesting pic—
tures can be described here. Sliding
down a deep snowhank in August
on one day and the next day cook-
ing a meal in a geyser seem like
fairy tales, but the snap—shots prove
them to be true.

Think of a chimney over 500 feet
high. One picture showed such an
enormous chimney used in a smelter
plant. You can readily imagine how
large an ordinary man looked he-
side it. Then imagine an oak tree.
under the spreading branches of
which 7,800 people can stand. This
is supposed to be the largest oak
