INFIRMARY PRIVILEGES

Dr. l’irubachcr announces to the
News lioard that inhrmary privi-
leges for students who have illncss
serious enough to require hospital
attention can be arranged for with
an Albany hospital. Details of the
plan, which involves :1 contribution
from each student, will be laid be-
fore the sludcnt body by .Dr. Brn-
bacbcr and Dr. Cronsdalu iii Stu-
dent Assembly on December 2.

Few of us are fortunate or care-
ful enough to spend four years in
college without suffering some sort
of illness due either to exposure or
accident. Generally speaking, none
of us really can, or cares to, allord
thc cxpcusc of being Sick,cspcci—
ally if the nature of the illness is
such as to demand hospital atten-
tion. Vcry frequently this hugbcnr
of expense kccps a student from
seeking the proper attention dur-
ingr an illness and the result is often
a long torment of after effects, an
unnecessary drain on nerves and
strength, or even a permanent dis-
ability, Assurcdly, then, Dr. Bru—
liachcr's announcement- will be
looked upon with much favor by
the student body.

In most institutions of collegiate
rating the sludcuts are required to
pay a ycarly inliriiiary fce. Con—
sidcriug the matter of a contribu-
tion on the part of each student in
the light of a vcry reasonable fee,
there should be no hesitancy on the
part of the student body to sup-
port any movement that is directed
toward. and so directly bcncficinl
to each one of us. The advisav
bility, yes, the necessity of some
arrangement for inﬁrniary privi-
leges for the students here is ob-
vious. We should, however, give
some .thought to the matter so that
we will be prepared for further de-
tails of the present plan.

SEINOR’S VIEWPOINT

During the past few worth every-
one has been expressing his or her
opinion on State College traditions.
It seems that thclast word has been‘
said, but the seniors still wish to
add their hit. Since they have been

 

in college they have learned noth-

iiig hotter than that traditions are
to be kept and to be distinguished
from sophomore riilcs. Since a
week ago Friday no one has been
able to truthfully say that he could
not make this distinction. ’l‘hc scu—
iors feel that when the uudcrclass-
men have been at State as long as
'22 they will appreciate the feelings
which exist toward these traditions,
It is these very traditions which
will make our Alma Mater :1 sclf<
conﬁdent and dignilicd institution.
Senior.

UPPERCLASSMEN AND
SOPHOMORES

Do you realize that the most or
citing girls’ basketball games in re-
cent history of State College are
bcing played right now in our
college gymnasium on Mondays
and Wednesdays at live o'clock?

’l‘lic freshman team is unusually
strong and has put up a stiff ﬁght
against all comers. The Yellow
and \Vliitc team has beaten every
team but that of the seniors, al-
though the scores have been very
close. iJ\t vtlic beginningr of the sea-
sou, clue to the fact that lllcy had
liven unable to prtlcliuc to—gcthcr.
thc juniors \vcrc considci‘cd the
weakest tcam. Yl'l‘ in [his last
game the shooting of Captain Scy»
mour almost spelled dcfi'at for the
Blue and \Vhilo. Alinost~—bnt not
quite. The Seniors and tho sopho-
mores have beaten every team
against which they have played.
'l'licy lllCt‘l each other on \Vcdncs-
day. Will you be there to sue them
play?

The freshman know they have a
team. They come out and support
it. Do we others do as much? if
as grcat a percentage of the girls
as the men of State. College sup
ported those games the players
would have something for which
to work. The schedule of games is
posted on the (i. A. bulletin
board. Notice [be close scores,
llicn—t’Tomc out and cheer your
team to victory!

WOULD YOU CALL
BLACK, WHITE?

if a pcrsmi is discourtcous, is be
courteous? A icw “'0ch ago there
was an article in tho News re-
garding the discourtcsy of walking
out from Student Assembly before
being dismissed by the chairman
of the meeting. The following
Friday even greater numbers of
students trampcd noisily out of the
Auditorium during our period of
Student Assembly. it would sccin
that State College students are dis—
courteous.

Last year it seemed advisable to
make a ruling which barred the
entrance of books. papcrs, lunches,
knitting and needlework to the
Auditorium during Assembly per-
iod. is it not more courteous to
knit quietly during this time than
to stir up confusion by walking out
of the room and thus plainly show-
ing tlisiiitcrcstcdncss? Yet we
made this ruling and enforced it.
Since there' seems no other way of
getting the desired results, let us
make a ruling barring students
from leaving the auditorium dur.
ing Assembly period except for ill-
mass—and let us enforce it!
