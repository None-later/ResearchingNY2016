SHERWOOD EDDY

DESCRIBES MISERY OF
EUROPEAN STUDENTS

 

“ Student life, as it exists today in
liurnpr, cannot be pictured," said
Sherwood Eddy, just back from
three months over-seas. "imagine
the despair of a student returning
aftrr four years of fielding," he
said, “to fall into hopeless misery,
with no food. insuflieient clothing,
and no work. After being sup-
ported by his fatnin for twenty
y wars. with high hopes of his
lltlllt‘t‘. the student is unable to earn
a livelihood, or obtain it from his
parents.”

Mr. iiddy visited the European
studen ' in their mre. impoverished
(pnu'tt-rs. llt' said, “There are stu-
dents in ix'us i'ol.’u|d.and in Cew
tral Europe, sleeping in parks or
railway stations, glad of a dry floor
or a little spare in whirh to pass
the night. There are students in
cold, cheerh-ss murets and rooms
this winter and many more wlm
envy these students even a cold
room or a bed without sufficient:
covering.

“in Vienna 'l interviewed the
students and student leaders. Matty
are working as laborers, mechanics
anti wood cutters to appease their
hunger, but after four years of un-
d‘erfeedintr they have not enough
strength for effective manual labor.
If they tutor, it requires ten hours
daily to earn a living, and competi—
tion is such that no one can obtain
so much work. Some are sellingr
newspapers on the streets, getting
one-fifteenth of a cent profit on
each paper and sometimes small
tips. But it is demoralizing to
stand for hours on the noisy streets
and live on tips.

“Matty of the students i met had
had no daily breakfast since 1917
till the Students Relief work was
begun. Now some 5.000 Austrian
students have been helped with a
daily breakfast at a charge of one-
third of a cent a meal. More than
1,500 women students have been
given clothing. Some were in such
pathetic poverty they had not evEn
the price of a piece of soap or a
bath and were verminous from
sheer poverty.

 

     

 

"Many of the men were wearing
their old army field uniforms, now
frayed and threadbare. Others had
a thin overcoat buttoned up tight
to the neck, without shirt or under-
wear. Matty are left with tubercn~
losis or malaria. Students who
have to wait for ten minutes in the
bread line sometimes become faint
and cannot stand. If a student
tutors for three hours daily he
earns but ten cents for it, or
twenty-six dollars a college year.
liven if a student gives up his
studies altogether and devotes his
whole time to manual labor he can
earn only from twenty to fifty cents
a day, which is not enough to per-
mit laying up money for his next
year's study.

“'l'housands of students in (ﬁen-
tral and Eastern Europe are stiffer—
in},v aml will continue to suﬂ'er
through the coming winter from
cold and hunger, insufficient food
and clothing, and from hopeless
despair. The students of some
thirty countries are uniting to come
to their relief. The Student Friend—
ship liund whirh is beint,r raised
now by the young men and women
in the srhools of the United States
is :I challenge to fulfill our moral
obligations to the students of the
world.”

FEATl—IERED FRIENDS
IN NEED

   

tt‘opied from .\lluu * Journal)

Albany nature lovers through the
lone stiltllllL‘t' days like nothing bet
ter than to comp: . notes on their
hobbies. The lovers of feathered
creatures, for example, are asking
one another. “:\re the birds in Al—
bany county diminishing? How
many spettes did you observe. last
sprine‘? What are some of the rrn»
son. for your emiclusious?” .-\n-
swers to these questions have been
attempted by Prof. irrnard .‘irou-
son of the department of ehemis '3'.
New York State (.Iollee'e for Teach»
ers. who has for an :tvocation, or
hobby, the study of birds.

When he was asked by the Jour-
nal man if the number of birds in
this vicinity is diminishiui.r l’rof.
ltrunson I‘t'lllt‘ttt‘d an emphatic
" lior proof Prof. 'llronson
suggested a visit to the museum in
the State Education building: where
the implirer will lind birds mounted
and lit-mint.r small cards containing
surll information as “Once com-
mon, now rare," “b'are.” and "No
longer found in this vicinity."

The Reasons

The reasons for the diminution in
the number of birds hereabout Prof.
Bronson explained as various:
Meteorological. the depletion of
woodlands, enlargement of cities,
and thc nutraudint: house eat. Un—
der meteorological causes are
classed the storms which catch
many birds on their migrations. .«\
year ago last spring flocks of robins
and other birds on their way north
were caught in a sleet storm. The
storm lasted for some time, the
birds could not get any food on the
ground, and many perished. In
Washington park after the storm a
considerable number of dead mi-
grants were found.

The disappearance of woodlands
is illustrated by operations going on
at the present time along the east
bank of the Hudson river between
chsselaer and Troy. A number of
Woodsman are systematically de-
nuding the hills and ravines north
of the old Forbes Manor grounds
of trees and even bushes. The re~
sult will be that hundreds of birds
that ﬁnd nesting places in the vicin-
ity will be driven out and they may
