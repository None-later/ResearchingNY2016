never return to the section. The
destruction of the woodlands means
the elimination of nesting places
and the departure of birds from the

vicinity., A third cause for the’

diminution .in dire number of our
feathered friends is the marauding
cat. In the country a hunting cat
can easily destroy on an average
two to three birds a day. At the
end of a season the aggregate for
one cat is considerable. "Birds
must have nesting places and must
be protected in some measure from
marauders like small boys and cats
if they are to continue with us,"
is the conclusion of Prof. Bronson.

Species Seen

How many species of birds
visited Albany last spring? Varied
ansivers are given by nature lovers,
but Prof. Bronson, who arose early
many mornings to look for them
with an eight-power prism binocu'
tar, reports that he observed 140
species. The number of species is
the same as I’rof. Bronson observed
in the spring of 1920, but in the
totals of individuals there were
fewer than a year or two ago, Prof.
Bronson believes. In other words,
although the number of species this
year was unchanged over that of
1920, the individuals in each species
were less. The decrease this year
was particularly noticeable amng
the warblers.

The first birds that came here last
spring were two weeks earlier than
usual, due to the mildncss of the
season. The 'robins were here
March 5 and 6; then came the blue.
birds, nteadowlarks, bobolinks,
crows. hiuehirds, and IE to IS spe-
cics of sparrows. The average date
for the appearance of the robin at
Albany is March 20. The robin is
not like many birds in his migra-
tion from the South in the spring.
The robin follows the 34-dcgrce
line north and is to be found in
such places as New York ‘City from
8 to IO _\" earlier than in Albany.
It is a curious coincidence that bird
lovers here have asked Meteorolo-
gist George '1‘. Todd for the mean
temperature of March 20 since the
weather bureau was established in
1874, and have found it to be
degrees.

After the first birds came last
sprng there was a lull and then
the rarer birds began to arrive more
like stragglers than methodical mi-
grants. The reason for the delay
is unknown. Some birds which
make their appearance here in the
spring did not show up. Among
them were the red breasted nut
hatch, American corn bill, pine sis-
kin and the red polls. One reason
suggested for the non-appearance
of these birds hcrcabout was the
mild weather of last winter. Few
of them migrated south last fall but
spent the winter in the northern
country.

Some Rare Birds Seen.

Local bird lovers have been re-
wardcd this summer by getting ob—
servations of a few birds rarely
found in this section. On Saturday.
July 23, at Valley Falls, Prof. Bron—
son saw a mocking bird. The
habitat of this bird is in the South
and there are few records of its
having been seen in New York
state. On July l8, a local observer
visiting in the Heldcrhergs near
where those mountains begin to
merge into the Catskills. saw four
pergrine falcons, a male, female
and two young birds. These fal-
cons are to be found in only four
or ﬁve places in New York state,
and are rare here. On June 22.
along the Schenectady road. a boy
shot a great horned owl, a bird that
was believed to have disappeared
from this section.
