CHRISTMAS SPIRIT

As the holidays draw near, we
should not forget that the true
spirit of Christmas is giving—not
receiving. There are many places
where we can hn sh our spare cash,
but lots of us don't spend it in the
RIGHT place. Any of the Alpha
Epsilon I‘bi girls can tell you what
this RIGHT PLACE is, for they
have charge of selling Ited Cross
stamps for the tuberculosis fund.
Is there any cause more worthy
than this one which is always
brought before our minds at this
time of year? Give it a boostl

  

 

ON OVERWORKING
A FEW

There is a tendency in every or-
ganization to impose upon the
leaders or upon a few members,
whose ability has been satisfacll‘ory-
ily demonstrated tbrn some pro-
cedure of the organiV'ltion, all of the
problems and tas of any great
imprn‘lancc that a c in the pro-
cedure of its businc s 'tnd the carry-
ing out of its pner as an or-
ganization. it is natural to look to
them for the solution of problems
and it is natural for them to accept
the tasks imposed upon them, since
they are the leaders. Moreover,
there would be no occasion to quc5<
lion such practice if experience had
not taught us that there is a point
of maximum efficiency.

We recall that, according to an
old proverb, a camel was once load-
ed so heavily that Ithe addition of
a single straw broke the animal’s
back. To be sure. the ‘human ani-
mal will not usually permit himself
to be as heavily loaded as the camel,
but he not infrequently allows so
much to be asked of him that he
cannot possibly do it all satisfactor-
ily and efﬁciently, and as a result
both himself and the work suffer.
The mere fact of the victim's wil-
lingness to attempt to do all that is
asked of him does not excuse the
asking.’ We should provide for a
more judicious distribution of the
work of the organization, both for
the sake of the overworked few, and
for the sake of more efficient and
satisfactory results. The exact point

 
 
  

 

 

 

of a man's maximum efficiency is
hard to locate, and the business of
an organization seldom requires that
any particular member be‘ worked
up to that point. A fair tl(lJllS_l‘lthllt
will prevent trouble, but a ftur ad-
justment is possible only when each
one is willing to do his s'hare.

ACHIEVEMENTS

 

Most of us, sooner or later, come
to feel that the achievements of
State College are. our achievements;
that what we do individually is for
the sake of our college connnuxnty
and becomes a part of the whole.
It is natural for us, then, filled with
a strong sense of college spirit and
community life, to be over-enthusi—
astic about what is produced here
in different lines of work; yet no
t't)l(l-ll)l00tl(.‘(l outsider can accuse us
of un\\-'arranted partialin for the
November issue of the “Quarterly”
because it is really deserving of
high p‘aise. Now is your chance,
all you public-spirited collcgc boost-
ers, whether you are lCnglish lovers
or not, to spread abroad your up-
preciation and enthusiasm for real
State t'ollege achievement.

.\ good college magazine must
have variety, both in subject-matter
and in form, ()nr "Quarterly" con-
tains a number of poems, some scri-
ous, wine in lighter vein. As to
prose, it offers us short sfori s, in-
formal e.". ys, descriptive sketches,
a legend, and three book reviews.
The subjects range from the humor-
ous and the fanciful to a real depth
of serious thonng and feeling. of
course, varicty and scope do not
mean much without quality. Let
us. then, think for a few moments
about the quality of the material
presented to us.

There is nothing much more
glorious and soul—satisfying than
humor in the best sense of the word,
To experience within one' elf that
delicious sense of the ridiculous,
which is gained sometimes through
actttal L "‘eriencc, sometimes
through reading, is more refreshing
than anything else to the average
individual. To be sure, some types
of humor are boring or rather vul-
gar. In "Diary L-aves” the author
treats us to the charming picture
of a soiled stocking descending on
the head of an unsuspecting caller,
I hope that the purpose in recount»
ing this incident is to make us laugh.
for that gives some excuse for writ-

 

  

.r

 

   

 

ing such a detail at all. The gii'l'~.

diary Is too trivial and too much
like other such diaries to be either
interestingr or funny. “More Diary
Leaves" t'omvs near ‘ to achieving
its purpose. It is in the story.
“Jerusalem and the investigating
Sch cc." and in the essay, "The
Semi—.-\nnnal .’\ll‘lt'l'lt‘illl Turmoil,"
that we get real humor most suc-

"fully portrayed. Cannot you
im gine yourself in the little boy's
place clutching 'tbe rooster and mt
mnring, “You gotta be ‘strangc,
Jerus’lem"? This story fulfils the
promise of its excellent beginning.
You cannot read the essay on house-
cleaning without having that mys-
terious sense of the ridiculous thor-
oughly delight you.

The “Legend of the Catskills,"
"lda May's Pilgrimage," “Rain-
drops,” the little poem, "Such
Fun,” "Elbean Songs," are notable
for their imaginative, fanciful char-
acter and originality. The legend
is not only original, but its theme
is made most vivid and clear by the
use of interesting, clear-cut detail.
“lda May’s Pilgrimage” conveys to
us. through its fineness of descrip-
tion and delicacy of feeling, a sense
of indescribable, sacred beauty. The
account of Joint Burroughs is very
pleasing, while the book reports are

 

 

  

  
 

 

 

 

interesting and make us want ‘to
read the books told of.

Especially to be p'aised are the
two poems, "Milkweed" and “After
Storm." We should feel proud fu—
tlcetl to feel that these poems, with
their ‘trong, imaginative appeal and
their richness of thought and feel-
ing, are contained in a magach
representing State College. '1 be
little peem, “The Deceiver," is well
worthy of notice. “The Ballade to
State College" must be near to the
hearts of seniors. in view of the
short time left to us here, these
lines have a special si tilicance for

 

   

us: ‘

“We‘ll always go eouu'adcly-wi‘sc

And share nttr snulcs—lhcre’ll be
no srghs."

STUDENT SECRETARY
AT COLLEGE

 

Miss Ruth Roche, one of the
several travelingr secretaries of the
Student Volunteer Movement for
Foreign Missions visited State ("oi-
lcge the past week.

Miss liot‘llc talked before the
Student Volunteers, at a V. \V. ('.
A. meeting, and also at a latg
cabinet meeting.

Since all t‘he missionary work
done is by educated persons, a di—
rect challenge comes to us as col-
lege students. in order to go to
a foreign field, a volunteer must
be under thinty years of age, for
under this age limit they are better
(rifle to acquire the new language.

it is the duty of the secretaries

to tell the cnllege students about
the tremendous needs so that if
they see the way Clear to go. they
may make preparations before if is
too late.
_ There is a big need for workers
in various professions. Not only
are those needed who have been
trained in the ministry, medicine,
or in teaching, but there is a big
demand for business head‘s. Set:-
rcfartcs and stcnographcrs are
wanted.

Educational leaders are needed
in the departments of Home Eco-
nomlcs, Music, and Physical Edu—
caf'on among others.

While it is a great mission [to go
to some foreign ﬁeld, we must not

 

C

    

 

think that there is the only need for
volunteers. We can do much at
home.

tory, especially during the last half.
