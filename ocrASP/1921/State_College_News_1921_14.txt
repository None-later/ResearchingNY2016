Large Audience Hears English
Dramatist's Address on
“ Abraham Lincoln,”

 

 

"The two outstanding person-
ages of the last live hundred
years. ltllltlllt" the English-speaking
peoples, were (Ilin-r t'ronnvrll and
x\lil‘.’tl1illll Lincoln," said John
Ili'iiikwatt-r. English dramatist and
poet. to a large audience at Chan-
cellor’s Hall Tuesday night in the
roiirse of his lecture on " .v\u Elig-

was given under the direction of the
Ilraiiiatie iiiid .\rts ;\‘ “'ttiou of
the State College for I tehers.

dramatist. .\lr. Driiiltwairr euiiiiei~
ated his conception of the artist’s

lives 0i r ' ,' ' 'y people
characteristics, instincts and trends;
that he translates these into terms
that appeal t0 readers or hearers
and that he is min It good artist so
long as he is faithful to this idea.
The writer who “gives the public
what it wants " need not neces-
sarily he an inferior artist, he said,
but often is an excellent one who
prostitutes his art to his idea of
popularity.

Driiiltwater. a young Englishman
of line presence and dirlion. spoke

The dramatist’s talk was con-

“Abraham Lincoln," but rather
