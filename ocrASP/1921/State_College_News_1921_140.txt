Chemistry Club

.\t the meeting.r of November 30.
Mr. Frederick Scott presented a
paper on chemical warfare In view
of the peace conference. it is well
to note the following facts which
were brought out:

l‘revious to the last war 995/.
of the weapons used consisted of
explosive projectiles or bullets.
Now 55% of the materials used in
warfare consist of poisonous gases
used in chemical warfare.

2. in the last war 12 times as
many men recovered from gas eas-
nalties as from bullet or projectile
wounds.

3. Chemical warfare caused 35%
of the German casualties.

4 it is estimated, that had the
war continued one month longer.

 

the United States would have pro-
(lttced more gas than the entire
wor<.

5. livery dye factory is a latent
gas factory. This should he re—
tnetttbered when the embargo on
tierutan dyes is discussed.

Five new members were initiated.

The ceremony of receiving tlte
new tnetttlbers was followed by an
infornral cocoa party where selen—
til' ubjeets became delightful con-
vetsalion.

FEATFI—E—RED FRIENDS

tt‘ontinued frotn last week)

   

()n the same day a pair of the
birds was seen on the \"estern
turnpike two miles beyond the
L'ouutry club. The great horned
owl is a had bird and it is
Well for peace and harmony
itt eonntry barnyards that be is
rare. Last winter several short
r d, or marsh, owls were ob-
served near the end of [lelaware
avenue. Some of these owls were
~hot by hunters and lmys who did
not know that these birds are both
rare and useful and should l)t' pro-
leeted. :\u Albanian who was down
the river about l5 miles one day
in the middle of June reported
seeing a common tern. 'l‘ltis bird
is known in Il)!‘ vicinity oi New
York and around the Great Lakes,
but to see it so near .\lbany was
a surprise to the observer.

Long Flights

Observers . tell many strange
things about birds. |')uc (5 have been
shot in western New Yoi with an-
digested rice from Loni. ta liclds
in their stomachs. it i known
that ducks are capable of digesting
a r' meal within 1.2 hours. The
observers who examined them came
to the .onclttsion. then, that the
birds must have completed their
long flight in about eight hours.
'l‘bos who study the habits of the
miut‘mts from the far North say it
is a matter of record for some of
these birds to start from their
homes in the .‘. "tic circle and never
set foot anywhere or take food or
drink until they alight in the south-
ern polar regions—a sustained
flight of 13,000 miles, or half way
around the world. Since July 4,
Albany observers report, birds from
the North have been migratng to
the far South to spend the short
summer now rapidly approaching
there.

ST. MTCHAEL’S GAME

 

     
  

 

 

 

 

 

St. Michael's basketball team got
revenge for their defeat last year
when they defeated State by a score
of 26-15 Thursday night in the Al-
batty High gym. This was the lirst
time that the varsity men played
together in a real game, so part of

their defeat can be. excused on the
ground of inexperienee.

in the tit-st hall St. Michael’s got
away front our men and began to
break through their defenses. in
this period they managed to score
15 points, ll of which were scored
by shots from the Iield. The men
from Vermont surprised the spec—
tators by the good exhibition of
basketball wltieh they gave. The
lloorwork of the team seemed to
ltave itnproved greatly sinee their
last appearance here. The WHI'b' of
" aek" Johnson featured. ’I‘ime
after time be snatehed the ball out
of a dangerous itnatiou and ad—
vanced it toward his own goal. He
also scored State's only point in
this half when he made good on a
free throw. The defense ot‘ the
Vertnouter' set-med impretuntbleto
our players. Often the hall was
advanced to within striking distauve,
httt the ball was intettepted on care-
less passvs, flnring this half .\le—
(jitter \\ retired atul Sherley took
his place.

Soon after the beginning of the
second half State began to show
what they were capable of doing.
The offense was started when Mr—
tiraw eat, d a long shot from the
center of the floor. Then things
began to hunt. “Marcus ’l‘.” Haley,
who was playing a good game,
broke through to score on another
field shot. Another field goal by
Metiraw and a free throw by
lloruune, who replaced Landon at
center. brought the total up to ll
polllls belore St. Michael's manaet-d
to score. Ilnt after this flash of
speed the gattte slowed up again.
St.‘ Michael's team got into their
stride auain and pulled away from
the l'nrple and (iold. .\it-(iraw and
Landon scored from the tield. while
Juilllstttl and lforunng divided three
tree throws between them. .\t the
end of the game the score was 30.15
