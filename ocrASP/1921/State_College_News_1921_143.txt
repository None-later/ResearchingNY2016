INFIRMARY PRIVILEGES

Arrangements harc but-n made
with tho Albany (‘in Hospital for
State t‘olluuc students to havc iu-
lirlnnry privileges lllcl'c if they so
choose. This plan would include
lllt' medical attendance of thc head
of the hospital staff, a private room,
care by the ward uur. .. board, and
the attendance of the interne. On
a basis established by previous
years’ records, each student might
avail himself of hospital "are
through ll\'t' days of illness each
year. Of course we are rcry glad
all of us do not rcqnirc fire days
hospitalization. but it is good to
have the assurance that we may
have adequate care if we are ill.

i\'ow that the obligations of the
hospintl have been explained, what
are our obligations for these lit-ne-
fits? fly a system of blanket taxation
each student is to pay one dollar
and a half. The saving of this sys—
tem is very clearly seen. The mini-
mum price for five days' illness in
the Albany City Hospital with such
provisions are planned under thr-
ncw system, is thirty dollars. Surc-
ly a saving: of twenty-eight dollars
and fifty cents is worth while.
Nor ncctl anyone fcar that he is
living on somconc cs: money
while he is in the hospital. Mary
Jones is ill ﬁve (lays this year; she
receives treatment from the infirm»
ary fund». Jane Smith is ill next
year and receives infirmary cart- for
which Mary Jones has helped pro-
vide. So Mary 1 s paid her debt
in helpingr others receive benefits
such as she had.

These privileges are for positive
illness. and a system such as this
must be arranged: one of our col-
lcgc doctors will certify that the
student needs hospitalization, that
is. she is ill cnondh to require it.
Then thostudent will be admitted
to the hospital. it is a question
whether or not nose and throat
operations should be included in
this fund. lf acute illness requires
an immediate operation, then of
course the infirmary fund takes
cart- oi the expense, 'But if a stu~
(lent should have an operation per-
formed for adenoids or removal of
tonsils. should the infirmary fund

   

 

 

 

 

 

also talrc care of that? The person

is not acutely ill; he is but taking
a healthful measure. When he has
his teeth filled. he is also taking a
healthful measure, but should the
inlirmury fund cover a students
dentistry? ’

Students living,r at home are llltt‘,‘
ly to say. “if I am ill, my parents
will Uth care of me.” livr-n when
people are living in their own
homes, hospitalization is some-
times necessary, or at last pru-
ft-rablc. Students living in this
city or community from the vicin-
ity are permitted inlirmary privr-
lt-gcs the same as those lft'l‘mlllt‘ll
the other student

Studcnts may say they can go
bonw if they are ill. It is the pol-
icy of our medical tlcparfnwnt to
solid home a student who is not
physically fit to be carrying on his
collth work. but who is not ill
enough for hospitalization. if a
physician slatcs that a student is ill
enough to be in a hospital. it is
surely unsafe for him to lower his
resistance pnwcr by travelling at
long distmicc on llltf tr: n.

'l‘hcrt: is but one remainng oh-
jcctioll. Thcrc are still tins —~icw
in number. \\'c hopc—who a pm"
viucial enough to have a dread of
a hospital. an’t'ly an institution
which will so carefully provide coup
fort and aid for us. is beneficial.
The aim of the hospital is to 5: re
lifc and aid toward phy. cal bin
and in a permnally frind way.
.\ftcr all, do we not wish most of
all for aid and comfort in time of
illnt-s and is not a hospital thc
Inosl cllicicnt placc to provide those
csst'nlials?

   

 

 
 

 

   

 

  

A Senior.
STATE, A MUSICAL
COLLEGE

\\'hun wr- ist» ovvr the list of
nofctl colleges in the country, harc
we not tht- fcndcncy to character

intcrcsts? \\'hcn wr mcnti‘on \"alc.

not think immediately of the vari-
ous types of colic-gr which they
represent? Certain ones are of the
athletic typc. sonic are of the blot"
ary type and others excel in musi .

State College, besides being a
tcacht-r’s college, is characterized
by its literary publications and its
music. Cripplcd by our nature we
cannot excel in certain lilies: how-
ever. in thcsv, our dominant inter‘
csts. we arc qualified to cnmpctt‘
with any other college.

ur ,. ion as a musical
collcg‘t‘ has llLUl affected largely by
the cfforts of our department di-
rector, Dr, Harold 'l‘hompson.
Moreover, very fortunate for the
college is the fact that wc havc as
instructor‘in music and accompa-
nist. an artist and composer of note,
l'u‘ofcssor 'l‘. f’rcdcrirk 'Candlyn.
whose scrviccs harr- l)('('|] given to
collca'c in various concerts.

State has a collcoc chorus which
can compare lnvorwbly with that of
any other college. \\’ho of you
attending,r tho (Vulgate-State con-
cert (lid not judge our numbers on
a par with Colgate? Our Chorus
excelled in many respects and is
worthy of praise for the general
impression it grave.

The college orchestra has always
been held in high regard by stu—
dents. lts appearance in public is
at all times enjoyed and apprcci-
uted. which shows the general de-
sire for and interest in good music.
Our large orchestra this year shows
talent amour.r us.

lege Music Association to promote
State College's musical reputation.

it provides us with concerts by vari-
ous artists. Motley for this pur-
pose was unaninunisly voted by the

of the first concert of the year, that
