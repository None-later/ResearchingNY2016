SOPHS AGAIN

    

The Sophomore girls scored a
vietory of NH" over the  , men
last ,\londav. Although the Fresh-
men have made tine progress. the
snperiority of the Yellow and
White was made apparent early in
the game. The rapid pass-work
and guardine‘ of Lit-bieh. the
Sophomore center. made seorina
almost impossible for the liresh~
men. The score at the end of the
first half was 10—3 in favor of the
Soplis.

llnring: the second half of the
aame the Sophomores scored three
baskets in rapid sureession. This.
roused the l'il‘eslttnan forward who
retaliated with two baskets. \\'lt(-u
the linal whistle blew the st'ore
