ing a minimum of useless affairs to
which to give our time and our at-
tention and otir energy. :l‘llcn, if
there is atiy particular subject that
a few hours of deliberate alld
patient concentration will lift from
the failure class—well, anyone who
has tried this form of ciitertaiir
nlcnt knows {list how highly satis~
tying it is. iinally| let us reserve
a few hours for day-dreaming,
musing, renewing our acquaintance
with self. We haven't had time to
keep in touch with ourselves as
closely as we should, and the care-
frec hours of vacation afford an
excellent opportunity for the rev
orientation of self and a chance to
make some little rcadjustmcnts in
our cosmos that may have a dc-
cidcd inllucncc on our reactions ill
the future.

of course we kilow that no one
will be foolish enough to follow
our suggestions. All we hope or
expect to do is to get someone to
look back at what they are looking
forward to and perhaps change
some minor detail so as to permit
a more cilicicnt waste of two glori-
ous weeks, so we hope tllat cvcry-
one, ourselves incliiilcd, Will have
a jolly and delightful vacation.

LISTEN FROSH i

it may seem a bit strange for
the sister class of '25 to pilSs any
adverse criticism upon '35. llow-~
ever in this case, the freshmen
seem to have merited the rebuke.
l'crhaps the situation in question
may have arisen from a misunder-
standing of the spirit of the upper-
classincii toward our varsity team.
l'crhaps tllc freshmen thiilk that
because our men llavc failed to will
the first games played that we as
the college are ilot standing back
of them. Let this serve to remove
forever any such illusion froill the
minds of the freshmen.

'l‘hc freshmen who declare that
thc nlclubcrs of the varsity tcaln
do not seem to be interested are
judging very unjustly. if two or
three hours of hard practice night
after night following a day of col-
lege work and dinner at half past
seven or eight o'clock, show lack
of interest, we can only say that
indeed, the freshmen hare peculiar
ideas of what intcrcst means.

Then, too, ’25 seems to have as«
sumed another unfair attitude in
continually praising the work of
their basketball team in high school
while criticising the work done by
our varsity team at State. Sup—
porting your high school team was
all right and still is, except when
you let that loyalty to your hiin
school team surpass that for your
varsity team at college. In be-
coming a part of the student body
of State you have signified your

DOORS OF CHRISTMAS
HEARTS

Years and years ago there was a
hostlcr of a stable who was very
careful of his cattle. He gave them
clean straw for a bed. and called
them each by name, One night.
after he had done all this. he heard
a call outside. He was tired from
his day's work. aild he did not
wish to answer the call: blit it
might be the king calling. and he

 

might get a reward, He opened
wide his door, and there he found
strangers asking for shelter. l’cr-
liaps his voice was a little gruff
when he said “Come in;" perhaps
the shadows bid a kindness on his
face. When he Allitd thrown clean
straw in all empty stall, he had
made ready for his guests, and he
had given his best for them.

The hearts of men are shelters,
too, and the keepers thcrcof rc-
nicnibcr that host of years and
years ago, for on tllat cvculug
every year they open wide their
hearts doors to those asking for
shelter. And on that evening of
every year to each one who gives
the best of his heart for shelter,
comes the spirit of that long ago
keeper's guest—'I‘hc Christ Child.

“Unbar your heart this evening

l:\nd kccp no stranger out, .

Take from your soul’s gri-at por-
tal

The barrier of doubt.
To hiilnblc folk and weary
Give hearty welcoming.
Your breast shall be tnmorrow
The cradle of a King."
