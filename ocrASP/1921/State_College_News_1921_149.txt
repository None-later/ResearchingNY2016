ince, probably the most severely
stricken of all those in the famine
regions, are a little people of a
world apart.

Starvation has left an indelible
ilnprint on their frail bodies, and
they carry themselves (lcjcctcdly,
apparently not at all concerned
with what goes on about theln. In
the ways of the world they are

administration entered this country
to feed them they were compelled
to forage their food or die. lint—

The American relief administra-

its ("hristmas plans for this yearcon—
forming to its set policy of spring-

Prince of Peace.

What matter if the population is
divided in creed? What matters that
Mohammedans of Kaau and those
of the lewish faith are here in
strong numbers as are those of the
Orthodox church? Christmas has
come to have its Significance among
all the nations of the world, and
Russia is no exception, Nor does
