POPULARITY

 

The desire to be popular explains
a multitude of good things and also
a multitudc of sins. it is the punch
behind old man l’nblic Opinion.
At the same time it is the evil spirit
bllilt keeps alive such villains as
Neglect of Duty, lixtravagmtce,ctc.
Nearly everyone is alllictcd with
this desire in a more or less violent
form, yet, like most things coveted,
popularity is the possession of the

ew.

Now there are various ways in
which people seek to be popular.
Some try to be tlillt't‘ctll, and to
gain inllucnce by this IlltJilllS. They
develop into “wise guys" and
“smart Alccks.” They try to be
superior. They use the slang at to-
day or to—morrow and sheer at
those who use the slang of last
week. Some of them brag about
the ex iling‘ pcoplu thcy know, al-
wnrs using a nickname. .-\5 the
New York Tribune says, ” The cen-
tral point is they are, publicly or
secretly, puffed up by the thought
that they are not as other men.”

Generally 5pc ‘ing. the people
who seek popularity do it in a Sullv
ish way. It is a selfish motive
that impuls them. Yet it is as the
Knickerbocker Prch says: “ There
is one royal road to [Ilil‘tlllill'lly
which is plain and yet which few
scum to tind. '.' tho path of
personal, vital intcrt ‘t in loll: them»
so res; a \rillingr a ‘

 

.. to hstru to
their talc oi woe or of joy; to weep
wbuu they weep, to laugh when
they laugh, and do it' with a hearti-
nrss that can come only with entire
scli—forgctfulncss. For everyone
who is willing to clinic his own
desire to be the centre of attraction,
there are ten thousand who will
not. To be popular requires a dc-
grce of unselfishncss that is as rare
as it is charming; to ‘bc interestcdly
unselfish is to be immensely popu—
lar."

Tobe popular, then, you must be
one of the " dubs " whom the New
York Tribune deﬁnes as "those
livable, friendly. personable folk
who keep the world turning while
the quippy intellectuals and the

 

.1;

wise guys and the smart Alecks
pick at them and sniff."

To bring the matter down to col—
lcgc life, a student who would be
popular must get down off the
pedestal of wisdom once in awhile.
He must leave the world of books
once in awhile and take part in
student activities. He must even
sacrifice the pleasure ol an A or
two in order to get better acquaint-
ed with his fellowtncu. This last.
however, is a dangerous remedy,
because the patient is very prone
to swallow the prescription, bottle
and all, and then to no longer have
need for popularity. it should be
used in moderation. The fact of
the matter is, however, that educa-
tiou is not merely book learning.
:\ 'ociations with college profess-
ors, classmates, fraternity brothers,
and roommates count it whole lot.
So while one is following the road
to true popularity, he is not neces-
sarily sttct'ilicing education, and he
may be a great help in carrying
on college activities.

 

 

Al the last two or three basket
ball games the freshmen have been
couspicions for their absence from
their usual place at the far end of
the bleachers. You may have
passed your Itiitlymirs. freshmen,—
you may have passed all your
courses at A, bill you still are
freshmen, and by no right of col-
lege tradition or sophomore rule
are you to sit with the other class-
mcn. ’l'hcn, ton. why is it that we
no longer sing “ lireslttttcn, li‘resh-
mun, Don't lit-cl Blue“? 11 was a
regular part of every game last
year. The freshmen looked for it,
they expected to stand up while it
was being sung. and other ciassmeu
lookc‘d forvnrdcd to it too. We
are all busy. but we should ttcver
br too busy to enforce our collcgc
traditions. and make the lrcs‘hmcn
r.t th‘ that they are still freshmen,
and must keep their proper place
at our games.

State College is taking many
lol‘ward steps tin-so days, and
'\ .ryonc h s noticed this with in-
creasing pride. However, to stead»
ily progress it is ary that
no negativc, (ill-sctling lmn'clllellls
bt- made. And all this is inst an
introduction to the inquiry, " What
has becontc of our t'l'l ' '-
'l‘hc g't‘t‘ttlcl‘ part of this is rxpoctcd
to be shown by the iri-slmn-u and
sophomores. but at the l'ost Exam
.lnbibro the upper classrs were the
ones that displayed anything that
rrsrtnblcd ‘spi And what has
brcome of the penalty lists and the
stern sophs marching arr-mid timid
lrosh? 'l‘hrrt- used to be a rule
that freshmen were to be sn'grc—
gatvd at baskrtdiull games. The
mombrrs of '24 have ch-u been
won routing out of chapel before
the other thru- cltts’srs burr dc»
parted. Juniors and seniors are
busy people and have litth time to
:ittrnd to such matters. Anyway,
it is the sacred privilege .‘tll(l duly
oi the sopbs to su that the lrosh
ubvy rules. This is just a little
reminder, '23!

To the Editor of thc “ News "1
Students are just beginning- to
realize that Easter is March 27,
and that our so-callcd Easter vaca-
tion starts April 5: also that last
year we were held a week longer
in june because of the celebration
of the 75th anniversary of the Col-
lege. and in compensation for that
week we were given extra time at
Easter. This year, we are being

 

held over without any increase

 

whatsoever. Our vacation lasts
exactly seven days; we are not
even given the bcnclit of the week-
end beginning Friday, April 1.. A

Many students are of the 0|)lltl()tl
that classes should not be. but
lloly Thursday and (mod l'rtdayl
because religious observances wll
necessitate a great number of ab
sellce's on these days.

Why do we not return to the
practice of having an Easter vaca-
tion? Do students want it‘? Lets
hear some more on the subject.
