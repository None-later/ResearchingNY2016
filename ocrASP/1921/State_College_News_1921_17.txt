“Master of Paradox " Will Give
Lecture in Vincentian
Institute.

 

Ker-n interest is manifested in
the appearance Saturday night of
the noted English author. (iilbcrt
|\'. Uhcstcrtnn, in Vinccntian lusti-
tutc. This will be ‘his only appear-
ance in The Capital District and
ermtps are plannng to come from
Schenectady. Troy, Amsterdam
and other nearby cities to hear
him.

As an interesting figure in tltc
world of letters to—day, Mr. Ches-
terton must be accorded a “high
place, it is ttot often that one
man combines so many gifts.
Lamb was an essayist; Shakes-
pe’are, a writer of plays; Dickens.
a novelist of purpose: ﬂood, a poet

 

 

 

of a magnetic lecturer, in itself
virtue enough for one ntau.

Those. who know his works best
feel there is a deep purpose be-
hind all ‘lllS utterances; that his
rhymes are not just. nonsense
verses, attd (that his play “Magic,”
would be sufﬁcient alone to crown
hittt. As a controversialth he
crosses swords with the kcenest
minds of the, world. turd is a recog-
nized master of paradoxes.

i\lr.ItThc‘stcrtmt is under the man-
agement of Lee Keedick, and the
opportunity to hear “him is adored
by tltc Catholic Wmueu’s Service
League of Albany, the proceeds to
be added to the league's charity
fttnd. Tickets may he obtained at
Clnett‘s atvd Walsh's, as Well, as at
the clubhouse, 162 State street.

WAS'i‘ED EDUCA—TION

 

 

 

In this age of democracy and
lltds‘hcvism it is probably heresy
to declare tltal the theory that
every boy should ltavc a college
education is thoroughly untenable.
ltut any man who has had any ex-
perience or practical contact with
college students knows that the
tltcot'y is untenable. There are
those who are actually harmed by
going to college, Sonn- are wholly
spoilt-ti, 'l‘bey furch whatever
habits of industry they may ‘hnve
had and they cultivate extravagant
tastes. if they were learning
something the situation wouldn't
be so bad. but usually they are the
very ones \\’ll() take, the most care
not in ex mse themselves to educa-
tion for fear that they may catch it.

Then too there is the other type
of boy who is industriou.. am«
bitions, conscientious and tries hi5
hardest to learn, but simply has
not got tltc brains [n gt) thruttgh
the task. lie is really a pathetic
lignrc, lL' is wasting valuable
money and even more valuable
little. httt he is so serious and faith
in] about it that everybody hates
In ll'll ltint that he ouphl to be
\vurking‘ in tl blacksmith shop or
a factory. it is hair that he often
succeeds in obtaining a degree,
lull he would be just as well off
without it. He is the one who has
caught education. lntt, having
caught it, doesn‘t knnw what to do
with it. He cannot make it serve
any useful purpose. it is unfor-
tunate, of course, that the cftsl of
citing to college has followed the
rust tli livingr in its upward llight.
lint c\'('tl nmv tln-rc is nothing iii
the situation to discourage the poor
bttt bright boy. The doors of
higher t-dttcatiun are still open to
ltint and the sact he will have
to make is cmntmratively no greater
than that of live years ago.
