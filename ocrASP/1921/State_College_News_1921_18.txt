dotes and toasts for those who have
to make public addresses, a gener-
ous list of biographies of famous
women chosen because of the in«
spiration of their lives, and other
subjects of vital interest to girls
and young women.

A large number of critical anno-

workers in these fields in making
exact selections of books for their
own selfvimprovement, for the use
of those under their care, or to en-
rich private, public or institutional
libraries.

A consistent use of the help af-
forded by this compilation cannot
result otherwise than materially to
increase the efﬁciency and useful-
ness of the user, Those working to
establish in girls good habits and
high ideals as to health. morals and
work, will ﬁnd many useful refer-
ences in each of these fields, and
their work can be made much more
effective if this catalog is used to
select appropriate literature to place
in the hands of the girls and young
women, to rccnforce the advice

Associates or subordimitcs can
be sent to this catalog to liml ma-
terial fut' entertainments, games
decorations, for costumes, etc. llltt
thus directors and advisers can be
relieved of the burden of detail and
left free to concentrate on the
larger problems of their work.
lsers of the catalog who are
called upon to address girls or
young- women frequently will liud
many ‘bonks and periodical articles
llslrd suggestive in both style and
content for such addresses.

So many references are given tin-
drr earll topic that some of them
will surely be found in every li-

A copy of the book can he obs
