serving them up again with
l'iilllt-Ol'll and litiss as relief pitchers.
The position behind the hat will he
well taken care of with l-lakcs, the
veteran of last year's team, and
Dooley, who comes to us with a

with Dotbris an all around man to

hold down the initial sack. How—
ever, he has a strong contender for
tile position in Dobris wlho rcglo

Around second and short J. Cas—

Coach Snavcly should be able to
