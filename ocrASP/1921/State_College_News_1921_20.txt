LYING

.\oi so many years ago We heard
it teacher instructing a fourth grade
class about Washington. First she

picked out Hill, and said, “ William,
tell us the story about yount,r
George and the cherry tree."

And Bill replied, “ Well, George,
he chopped down a cherry tree, and
his father saw it, and he got hold
of George, and (ieoree said he done
it, and his father didn't lick George.”

Then the teacher said. “ Yes,
that's right William, And now,
children, you remember that it pays
to tell the truth ali'ays. Never lie."
And the children all seemed to
agree. But after school Bill walked
home with his friend Jack, and
they talked about automobiles,
)acic began to ‘lll‘zll,’ about his Dad’s
.new Studebaker car. “Aw, that's
.nut‘liiu’.” said Bill. “ My Dad’s
principal of the Sarcbush high
school; He gets tcu tiousand dol-
lars 'a year, and we're going to
have a Hudson Super Six." Oh,
the imagination of youth!

"hat teacher is not the only one
who holds up \Vashiiigtoii for the
emulation of youth with the warn-
ing note, “ Always tell the truth,
‘never' lie." Many parents and
teachers of today do the same
thing. Still. if the young George
'lived-today and studied his life as
it is now presented, we wonder
which he would 'llllllk the more
,heroie, George’s truthful answer. to
,his father, or this famous tricking
.of thrliiiglish forces when he left
his camp ﬁres burning and marched
‘on Trenton. in regard to Wash—
ington and the cherry tree he would
probably say, " Aw shucks, George

-'knew his father and he. knew he
I was caught, so Ihe took the easiest
.’ way out.” I

' But‘ what’s the use of bring-
» ing' Washington out of his grave,
Just imagine in those Revolution-
ary days that the fate of the whole
'Amcrican forces rested on tellingr
i one little lie. Would he have been
Clike the sister in Victor. Hugo’s
'Jainous novel- "Les- Miserables,"
'twho saved Jean Vatican's life with
. a lie, or. like~Wistcr s famous hero,
.theg .Virginiait, who saved. the

 

' judge's property in a"dnel of wits

 

wlt'h‘tlie villuln Linmpas, or like
T'Wlllll's “ Huck" Finn, who saved
his black friend Jim's life by a
small-pox score: or would he still
have been just " Trutiiful‘" George?

“But tililat's only a white lie,"
someone says. Well, then, what is
a white lie, and how shady must it
be before it becomes a black lie?
And as far as that's concerned what
is a lie'ﬂttll Wihat is the truth?
Well, this is getting too deep for
us so we’ll stop.

And the point to this editorial.
Frankly, there isn’t any. 0 sim-
ply want to remind you that Tues-
day was Washington’s Birthday.

 

TO ‘23

Following the many suggestions
and reminders which they have re-
ceived, the sophs made the fresh-
men sit in the section reserved for
them at ulte basketball game Satur-
day and stand while "ll‘res‘hnicn,
freshmen, don’t feel blue ” was
sung. To give l‘llclll a good dose
they sang the song over twice so
that the frosh would get a good
taste of their medicine. It really
seemed good in see the soplis wake
up and show it little class rivalry.
We have illl heard about it before
coming to college and are rather
disappointed when we see so little
of it. 'l'thcrefiire we feel that. prob-
ahly, down in their hearts, l'llt'
fri-slunen were rather glad to be
made to sit alone.

We were very much pleased to
see how graciously they not up
and went to thr' section when told
Io. 'l‘liey also made no "kicks"
when they had to stand during the
singing.

Now that the sophs have begun
to make the freshmen obey rules,
let them keep up the good work.
liven if l'llt‘l'e is only one more
game at which to make them hc~
have. there are many other oppor-
tunities for showing their authority.
M1 the good work go on, '23!

  

DESIRE FOR
POPULARITY

 

Like the light slraiv lhe tickle
fellow floats upon the stream of
popularity for a time, and then we
Wonder what has happened to the
straw.

livery community has it man who
courts popularity—a man who
seems overwhelmineg anxious to
do anything that will put him in
the limelight. He is always up
front in every public meeting—
always subscribing for more than
he can pay for.

in his desire to be popular, 'hc
neglects his own business interests.
in his failure to keep this promises
he soon becomes unpopular.

No man can live on popularity
longer than it boy can live on cream
puffs.

My suggestion to the man with a
craze for popularity is to go 5 my
and settle asnhc goes.

Contracting for more than you
can pay for is a crime against your
own interests. and a chance for the
public to call your bluff.

" Silent Partner.”

_ FINESSE

 

 

.‘Fiuesse is not a common word,

but it has. an uncommon meaning.
it is the reﬁnement of draWing dis-
tinctions, and the delicaCy,of mental
action, It is clearness, sometimes

cunning. [but always stratageni.

o .ﬁ'n’esse when we use our

“meansm ﬁt our circuiiistauces—

when We graciously grant what we

 

cannot refuse—when We concil-
liite those we cannot conquer.
This does not mean that we must

necessarily surrender a principlep

but it does mean that we must bend
a little or break.

The fool’drives through the until
in the lowlands for twenty miles
because he will not detour and then
ride where the roads are high and
dry. The foal will not change his
eourae until l)llllk('(l off the plank.

t know a man who seems to en-
joy opposltion. in his stubborn
way he will stand out against the
entire meeting. lie has won a
reputation for always being on the
opposite side. He lacks finesse, and
every time he stands on his hind
legs and starts to talk the boys say.
“ There he goes again." .

The unfortunate part is that this
man is often right, but nobody
seems to take him seriously. in
his lack of finesse he has lost favor,
and when you lose favor, you lose
much of your influence.

Sometimes We gain more ittlvtlll'
[age by bending a bit than we do
by constantly challenging every
subject that comes up, Just- the
same as a man gains more credit
by hiding his ignorance. as coni-
pa'-il Willi an awkward attempt to
exhibit his education.

Finesse finds a way without. spill-
in}.r the beans.

The best of lali-nls often prove.
fatal without finesse, ln act
finesse supplies the place of many
talents.

The man without finesse is like
the farther who had a sundinl on
the front of his house. llis neigh-
bors and the passengers could see
the time of day while going by, but
he, the ancient, had in on outside
the house to tell the hour. Al
niehl he had to guess.
The snudial has some excellent
dual" s and is very serviceable
iiuiler right conditions. and so it
is with a man who inch” finesse.
llut the sun does not always shine.

if you want to remove most
obstacles. rail in the man of fact.
Some call it finesse,

ART COLLECTION —- IN-
TERVIEW WITH MISS
PERINE

it is through the Dramatics and
Art Association that we have had
so rare an opportunity, during the
past two weeks. to see so many re—
markable copies of the famous
paintings of the old aiiil the modern
masters.

The collection comes from the
American Federation of Arts, one
of the greatest organizations in this
country, which has for its purpose
the educating of people in the ap-
preciation and the llll(l(tl‘Si:lll(lllll,’ of
art. They send out traveling ex-
hibits, such as we have had here,
and publish several periodicals that
contain articles and pictures, which
treat of art and its appreciation.
Miss Pcriue calls to our attention
the fact that one of their publica—
tions, “ The American Magazine of
Art." is placed in our library rack
each month. it cannot but interest
anyone who feels the least love for
art, for it contains proposed war
memorials. notes on the art gal—
leries, ‘and articles on all sorts of
art interests. .

In this collection of between
seven -lrundred and, eight hundred
pictures we have represented for.

us the werk of about one hundred;

and ﬁfty-ﬁve artists, a great many
of whom are .modern..Ameriean
masters. These-pictures .are re—
productions pf the famous originals

‘by the best prnitniakcrs in the

world. As proof of the remarkable.
accuracy of the work, We have only
to compare the one original that
was sent us with its print, as Miss
l"erine did for us last "riday. There
are various kinds of prints in the
collection, color prints, lithographs,
photographs, enlarged photographs,
and photn uravttres.

’l‘he prints from lltc old masters
have attracted a good deal of at—
tentiou—especially,‘ Da Vinci's
“ Mona Lisa," Gninsborough's
" Mrs. Graham," and Rubeu's “An«
toritratto." lirom another period,
that of the profoundly religious
l2th and Lilli centuries, we have
several good representatives.

Perhaps the best English win!
we have is liacbnrn’s lovely tiiuu,
" lioy with Rabbit,” lironi the
French school, we have Carol’s
"Landscape." h'lfi‘llvc'ﬂ " Hack to
the Fold,” and others quite as
charming, ’l‘he Scandinavian prints,
a little unusual in their clear. bright
coloring, nuurbi-r among them
Lnrsson's " lilyl," and “The Hat'-
vest," as well as Zoou's “Chieiicf-
skulla." The Abbey pictures,
especially that of “ Kim,r Lear" and
"(inliliad the Di-liveret'” have
called fot'tli"a good deal of faviirnblp
comment.

in the .'\lll(‘|‘lt‘1lll school, we llllll

SOME PHILOSOPHY

 

 

The past cannot catch me, the
present will not crush me, the
future is in come.

The past points out my errors,
I2he present loans lllc my chance.
the failure will find me ready wlicu
it comes.

Out of the mistakes mended out
of ‘lO-(llly attended and with tor
morrow blended with hope, i am
happy to be here.
