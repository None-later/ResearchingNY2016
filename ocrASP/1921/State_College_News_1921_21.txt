“Pictures are wor ed out by
three laws of shape, size, and color
or tone, in order to et tin: most
beautiful expression 0 a theme on
paper. " .iu ‘F'og Warning’ by
Homer, the oval shape of the boat
was the dominant point, subordi-
nated by the threatening clouds
and roaring sea. Homer paints
waves with pow-er as no other
artist docs."

Miss l‘crinc explained the picture,
” Curitas," ‘by Thaycr, who uses his
own handsome daughter as his
nuulel. The idea of charity is
uniquely expressed. Like the ivy
uverurowing the oak tree which
supports it. little children are in
this picture supported by a rugged
woman. W'hen organized society
gives. it gives not for pleasure but
for satisfaction. This is nutuifested
in the expression of loveliness and
kind hearterincss of the girl.

The. subject of standard rings for
the college was then presented by
Harriet Holmes. The lirst queer
tion voted upon was whether we
wanted seal or letter type. As the
seal Minerva. has been our symbol
siuee i’Jiii when we became a cob
lege. it was voted to adopt the
uni type. ’

The second question was the
style of the, ring. The student lmdy
adopted the oval shape with a black
barkm'ouud.

ALBANY GUILD FOR
PUBLIC HEALTH
NURSING

it has recently come to our notice
that only a few college students
are aware of the advantages of the
Albany Guild of Nursing. This
Guild cmploycs all hospital graduate

nun-3&5 for the scrvrcc of anyone,

desiring nurscs' care. This service
can he obtained at any time and
for any length of time, the
patient paying a moderate fee of
any sum he desires. The Guild
aims not to make money but to
treat all sick people. both the needy
and others, unable to obtain the
service of a full time nurse. Any
college stutdcnt desiring a nurse’s
care for certain hours of the ‘day
or for only one hour can obtain
this scrvicc‘in Ihcr home from the

Albany Guild for Public Health

Ntirsing,.15 Washington Ave.
The work of this organization
must necessarily depend to a large
extent upon volunary contribu-
tions. In return for its service to
you and your sick and poor it
asks your support. Can you not
give some small contribution to
this cause? An'y contribution. 'how-
ever small, is very welcome, and
can be leﬁt in Dean Piercc‘s other).
