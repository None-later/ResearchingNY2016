rise in the world of business by
doing just what he was paid to do,
and not one mite more. Sinithers
was a consistent chap, and this idea
of "gettiug-before-you-give" had
become a habit with him. One

to feed the furnace. He decided to
dicker with it just as he dickered
with t'he boss, so he opened the
door, got a shovel of coal, and said
to the furnace: “Now, you give
me some heat, then I'll give you

He didn't know that the ﬁrst law

planted before the harvest. If we
want "moratzmnncy, we must "ﬁrst
give a helping measure of service
for our present salary.

If we want a raise. we'll never
get it h following the Smith'ers
plan. a will get more money
only by doing more than we are
paid to do. There are no Vcrop
failures in the ﬁeld of service.
Your boss doesn’t determine your
salary. You dol
