DR. J. B. HOWE LECTURES
0N JOURNALISM

Dr. John ll. Howe, of the editorial
stall of thc ‘yracuse “l-lerald," of
Syracuse. ticllirrt‘tl a most instructive
and interesting lecture before the
Student Assembly Friday morning.
Dr, Howe spoke on “Newspaper
Duty and Service.“ and dclirercd a
most. illmnit'iating message to his
hearers. Dr. lon'c came here under
the auspices of the Press Club and
Miss Murray's class in journalism.

in introducing the speaker, Dean
i'ioruer said that, contrary to custom,
he was going to present the audience
to the speaker instead of the speaker
to the audit-nee, for in the audience
1: the editors, proofu’t‘nders and
' taut editors of three college pub-
lications. the “News,” the “,Qnar~
tcrly" and the “Pedagogne.” On
this account the audience would be
an appreciating one ln that it cons
tained fellow-wodters of the speaker.
hit: llowe said: "i deeply appre~
ciate the honor of addressing the stu~
dents of the Sitttc'Colicge for Touch-
ers, under the auspices of its Departc
nicnt of Journalism. As a veteran
newspaper man l am always delighted
to learn of the advent of a college
class in journalism or of the popu—
larity and prosperity of an older
claSs. because the course of study and
training here supplied is intended to
satisfy a long-standing and urgent
nccd of our pro fession."

He further said: “Newspapers be-
long to one of the most democratic
of professions in that this profession
is the easiest to enter. To anyone
with talent, pencil, paper and ability
to write a good story the door is
open. The work is distinguished
from other kinds by the fact that
there is no preparation or test for
the newspaper employee. He proves
his right to remain later. The Op-
portunities for advancement are free

ATHLETIC COUNCIL PRO-
POSES A CHANGE,OF
COLORS FOR STATE
COLLEGE

Student Body to Decide Whether
Purple and GoldvWiil Remain
-—Quéstl0n ‘to be Discussed

are

In a meeting with Dr. Brubachcr
in the President’s ofﬁce Wednesday,
February 23. the Athletic Council
petitioned the President for consid—
eration of a change in the colors of
State College. The main‘ objections
to the present combination were pre-
sented by Coach Snaveiy. First, he
said that in the Capital District there
are at least live secondary schools
which have Purple and Gold. namely,
Christian Brothers' :\cadamy, Cathe-
dral .-\cadcmy, La Sallc, St. Bernard
and the Johnstown l-llgh School.
This fact makes it hard for the local
newspapers to simply use the colors
when writing up State College ath-
letics, for it would be very confus-
ing. In this way State loses the dis~
tinction that Syracuse has when it is
referred to as the Orange, or Har-
vard as the Crimson, and Colgate as
the Maroon.

Another reason for the proposed
change was that oach navely
found it hard to fill orders for has-
ketball, hockey and baseball equip-
tnent. l‘nrple and Gold are not stock
Colors, and when they are obtained
the purple especially is not a good
ye. Consequently it cannot be
washed without running and chang~
ing in nearly all the colors of the
rainbow.

After hearing the reasons for such
a change, Dr. lirnbacher opened the
Contimwd on page 4.

PHYSICS DEPARTMENT
PERFECTS
WIRELESS STATION

Student Body Invited to Hear Con-
certs and Time Signals

Under the special direction of Mr.
Long. the Physics Department of
State College has perfected a wire-
less station in the Department odices,
so equipped that messages front great
distances are transmitted and ampli-
fied, so that they can be heard in the
lliology Department at the further
cud of the second floor corridor in
the Science Building.

in order that the faculty and stu-
dents of the college may share in the
beneﬁts of the wireless station, a
shelf has been ﬁxed outside the door
of Room l54 on which the horn of
the receiving apparatus will be placed
nearly every day, so that anyone who
wishes may hear the accurate time
signals from Arlington. Virginia,
and set his watch accordingly. These
time signals are sent out by means of
a system of dots and dashes. Be-
ginning ﬁve minutes before noon, for‘
four minutes a dot is transmitted
every second except for the twenty-
ninth second and the ﬁfty—fifth to
the fifty-ninth seconds of each min-
ute. The last minute before noon a
clot is transmitted for each second

except the twenty-ninth and the last
