THE PURPLE AND GOLD

In considering the proposed change
in colors for State College many
practical reasons were set forth as
to why such a move would be benc-
ﬁciai. First. it was argued that more
distinction would be given the col-
lege by such a change. Then it was
shown that athletic supilies could be
purchased more readiy and more
reasonably, and that the dyes on these
goods would ,be more permanent.
And the only objection offered
against relinquishing the Purple and
Gold was simply that these colors
have been a part of State College for
a long time and a great deal of tra-
dition and sentiment is attached to
them.

Now, we ask in all seriousness, is
it shallow sentimentality to advance
such an objection in the face of the
common sense reasoning of those
who want different colors? II it is
mere sentimentality, does it not. even
50, play a large part in the life of a
college, yes, and the life of a nation,
an(l._,t\he world in general? If a pro-
posal were on foot to change the
colors of the Stars and Stripes be-

.»,cause_ othercount‘ries use the same
‘ combination, do you suppose true

Americans would leave Betsy Ross
and their feelings out of the argu-
Oi course the Stars and
Stripes are much dearer to State Col-
lege students than the Purple and
Gold, but nevertheless there is some
degree. of comparison. Or just sup-
pose that the world were turned over
to cool-headed business deals without
any of the familiar sentiments of
home and mother, what a queer thing
life would be?

So in deciding this matter shall
we not give some attention to the
person who says. "I have no real
reason for not changing the colors,
except that deep down within me is
a great love and respect for the Pur-
ple and Gold."

‘ STUDENT DISC—USSION

 

Students. uow‘is the time for you
to prove the wisdom' of 'the student '
vote 'in Friday morning Assemblyl
0n Marclr 11 there will be brought

on application to the l

 

before you for consideration a pro-
posal to change the college colors.
This is a question vital to everyone
in State College. How are you go-
ing to decide it? Up to the present
time student meetings have made a
decidedly poor impression on the
faculty and some students them-
selves. It seems that chapel hasbecn
a place of entertainment and not for
serious, thoughtful discussion of
questions involving the college wel-
fare. Here, then, is your great op-
portunity to correct this impression.
And. in the meantime, if you‘ have
any ideas on the subject, write to the
“News.” v

GRADUATE ATHLETICS
MANAGER SUGGESTED

With thc development of a perma-
nent athletic policy at State College
a graduate manager becomes a neces-
sity. l'lerctoforc each manager.
when he assumed control, entered on
his work with no experience. From
your to year it was a succession of
alumni meets, not a \vcllsdcveloped
continuous aim. A graduate manager
will provide the needed connecting
link between the seasons. The man
chosen should be a mcurbcr of the
Athlclic Councii and a graduate of
the college. .A man in this position
can be a vcryrgrcnt help to the devel~
opmeut of the athletics of the col-
lege, assisting the student managers
in avoiding mistakes so easily made.
in distributing .‘lllllt. C funds he
would the able to direct the student
manager so no losses would occur
and the greatest beneﬁt could be dc~
rived from the expenditures.
