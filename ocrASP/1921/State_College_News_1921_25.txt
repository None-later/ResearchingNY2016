\2 What Is Air Pressure?

bombard you from all sides. A thousand taps by a
thousand knuckles will close a barn door. The taps
as a whole constitute a push. So the constant bombard-
ment of the air molecules constitutes a push. At Sea-
level the air molecules push against every square inch of
you with a total pressure of nearly ﬁfteen pounds.
Fressure, then, is merely a matter of bombarding mole-
cu es.

When you boil water you make its molecules ﬂy off.
The water molecules collide with the air molecules. It
takes a higher temperature to boil water at sea-level than
on Pike’s Peak. Why? Because there are more bombard-
ing molecules at sea-level~more pressure.

Take away all the air pressure and you have a perfect
vacuum. A perfect vacuum has never been created. In
the best vacuum obtainable there are still over two billion
molecules of air per cubic centimeter, or about as many
as there are people on the whole earth.

Heat a substance in a vacuum and you may discover
properties not revealed under ordinary pressure. A new
ﬁeld for scientiﬁc exploration is opened.

Into this ﬁeld the Research Laboratories of the General
Electric Company have penetrated. Thus one of the
chemists in the Research Laboratories studied the disin-
tegration of heated metals in highly exhausted bulbs.
What happened to the glowing ﬁlament of a lamp, for
example? The glass blackened. But why? He discovered
that the metal distilled in the vacuum depositing on the
glass.

This was research in pure science—- research in what may be
called the chemistry and physics of high vaeua. It was undertaken
to answer a question. It ended in the discovery of a method of ﬁll<

ing lamp bulbs with an inert gas under pressure so that the ﬁlament
would not evaporate so readily. Thus the efﬁcient gas-ﬁlled lamp

THE air is composed of molecules. They constantly

of today grew out of a purely scientiﬁc inquiry.
So. unforeseen, practical beneﬁts often result when research is
broadly applied.
