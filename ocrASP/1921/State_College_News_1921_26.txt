t “A profession easy to enter is like-
wise easy to leave. Newspaper men
leave their posts often because of the
strong demand outside for men of
application, energy and intense alert-
ness. Men yield reluctantly because
they are fond of the work, but some—
times pass into one of the following
ﬁelds of ﬁnance, medicine, commerce,
law or even the ministry. The en-
tranoements of the newspaper work
are manifested in the variety of in«
terest, To the editorial writer new
experience is i-nfoldcd daily. No one
ﬁtted for the task is bored.

” It is the duty of all newspapers,
besides the publishing of news and
editorials, to help the community.
Too many are satislied with miscel-
laneous writing and advertisements.
In order that a city wrong he riglited
public opinion must be aroused to re
spond to a sense of justice. This oc—
casion is supplied through the news.
paper. Whenever a great evil. either
of the political, social or industrial
life, is committed, ii is to the right
kind of newspaper that the people
look for the righting of the wrong.
Frequently this service is performed
with the risk of antagonizing the
public.

V”The moral issue presents an un-
limited ﬁeld for servicc, which is,
ﬁrstly, to protect property, and, sec-
ondly, to grant security,.utility and
contentment to the public. For ex-
ample, if a private tradesman charged
exorbitant prices, it is not the busi-
ness of the newspapers, but when the
distributor of milk does this, it is
their duty to correct the injustice.
injury, then, to the public is the
newspaper’s concern, and likewise, to
keep watch on the political adminis—
tlration, the city government, is their

uty.

“in writing up accounts of crimes
a reporter must use with discrimina-
tion in' dealing with the facts. ‘He
must exclude all but the pleasant
ones. RepuIsive details must be left
out. Contrary to the procedure in
writing ﬁction, crime must not be al-
lowed to go under false cover.
‘ “ The editorial page has been
called the 'mold of public opinion.’
This is a wrong view, for in the
present times people mould their own
opinions. We should think of edi—
torials as interpretations. Whether
right or wrong. both should be
spoken. In case of disputes in the
social, economic or industrial life,

 

there is often no one side totally right 7

or wrong. . 7 I

ATHLETIC COUNCIL

matter to general discussion, and
some objections to relinquishing the
old colors were recorded. The chief
of these was that a mass of tradition
has been built around the Purple and
Gold in the past and a change would
do away with this. In connection
with this it was pointed out that tra»
Eliition is an important part of college

l C.

After carefully summing up both
sides of the question Dr, Brubacher
decided to refer the question to
Myskania, and a committee of men
from the various athletic teams, for
further consideration, and to ﬁnally
put the matter to vote in Student As-
sembly Friday, March 11. The Com-

mittee appointed includes Coach
Siiavely, chairman; Edward Linck
and Harold Baldwni, 22; linrles

Reilly and Adrian Johnson, ’23, and
Oliver Putnam, ’24. Maurice I'laihorii
was named as general chairman of
the two bodies.

Among other colors suggested, :1
dark blue and gold, blue and gray,
seemed to meet with the most ap-
proval, as they involve less change
than other combinations. and at the

same time overcome all the objections\

to the Purple and Gold.
