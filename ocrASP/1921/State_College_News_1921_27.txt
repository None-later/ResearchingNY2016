The, theme of the farce was in-

four scenes. In the tirst scene we
were transported to the nominating
convention. No one would deny
that the “
“lapel bouquets " of the delegates
had a momentous inﬂuence on the
convention. mmlct‘tt air was
created in the session by the pres—
ence of a “feuiiuiuc roscbud.”
Cox and his one adherent made an
impression. but I’l'arding's titan was
the ‘hit. The convention atnncd
for its past evils by preserving the
ancient reﬁnement of the Greek
style of voting.

In the second scene we were ac-
quainted with the joys of a presi-
d’cntial campaign. Even ” elia”
began to pity the harassed Hard-
ing. However, the president's
problems are all solved when he
accepts Mary O'Callahan as Secre-

THE DEPARTMENT OF
HYGIENE

 

Federal Assistance Withdrawn

 

The Federal Government has dis-
continued the ittlCt‘tlcptu‘tmcnlttl
Serial Hygiene ltuard. During the
war and up to amt through the
present collect: year, the Federal
ltuarrl has carried on extensive
work in Hygiene in many colleges
and universities throughout the
United States, State College
shared in this work, as did Cornell,
Harvard, University of l'ettttsyl-
vauia, and a score of other colleges.
The ("continuance of the Federal
appropriation will necessitate im<
portaut changes. Either the sev-
eral States must assume the finan-
cial burden of the work or the work
must be dismntinued.

It is quite probable that most
colleges where the work was 4rr~
ganized by the Social llyeieuc
lloard. will continue the work.
This is due to the excellent results
obtained so far. In every case. the
work has proved very satisfactory.
The work of the State College lly-
gieue department was singled out

AGGIES SATURDAY

In what will probably be one of
the best exhibitions of basketball
on local courts this season, State
will pit her strength against the
clever Mass. Aggie quintet in the
A. H. S. gymnasium next Saturday
night. A game was scheduled with
Hobart for this date, but owing to
cancellation of other games, thus
making the trip impracticable, the
Orange and Purple team was unable
to meet State. Manager Bliss.
however. was able to book the
strong Aggie team in its place.

The hilassac‘husetts team has won
favorable notice because of its
speedy ﬂoorwork, clever passing,
and accurate shooting. It ranks
among the best college lives in this
section.
