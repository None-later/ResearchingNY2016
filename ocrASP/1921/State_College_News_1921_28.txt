THE COLLEGE MAN

F‘— t
in the “Saturday Evening Post,’
for February 5, Nathaniel Butler
has an interesting discussion on
“What a Man Gains in Going; to
College.” Admitting lirsL oi all
that there are some for whom a
college education is economically
out of the question, some “whose
full measure of culture anti attain~
ment, so far as school can help
them at all, is reached before the
college stage," and some who he-
cause of mental or physical feeble-
ncss should he excluded from
higher institutions, he still effec-
tivcly answers those who think,
that a college education is a waste
of time, and true instruction com-
mcnccs with graduation.

In clinchng his point that higher
training: is worth while, L\lr. llutlcr
hrst proves that a college educa-
lion has actual mom-y value. l’rom
statistics compiled ivy the liuitcd
States Bureau of Education he
shows that the college men receive
the highes average wages in all
ticlds of commcr l and industrial
enterprise" llt‘ cut-s .\lr. (fharlcs

ltowdnin Collette. .\lr. llydt- left
on record a rlassical enumeration
of what a man twins in this re—
spect from going to college:

“in l‘L' at llillllt' in all lands. and
all ages: to count Nature a familiar
acquaintance and .\rl an intimate
fricnd' to gain a standard for the
.ntion of other men's work
and the criticism of one's own; to

dents who are gentlemen; and to
form chara' under professors
who are tfh lians——thcsc are the
returns of a college for the hcst
four years of one's ite.‘

.\lr. liutlcr goes on
say:

“The characteristics which are
sometimes regarded peculiar to the
college hoy—imlitTcrcuce, vanity.
cgoism, argument, slang—arc in
fact those of youth, whether in or
out of college. "iere is room for
a wide difference of opinion as to
whether between the ages of eigh-
teen' and twenty-tour the youth
gets these thing‘s knocked out of
him and gets some sense knocked
into him more effectively in hush
ness or in whom."

And in conclusion lle sums up as
in owe:

“Statistics of college attendance
and of college endowments, the
judgment oldendingr men in eom~

aucrcc and industry, the expres-

sions of conﬁdence at the Alticrican
people in their colleges, and the
degree in which the graduates of
American colleges have led in
every walk of public and private
life testify to what a man gains in
going: to college, in his ability to
get the host things out of life. to
stand for the host things in life, to
lind his place and do his work."

PRINCETON MORALS
IN STUDENTS' CARE

 

FacultyCives Senior Council Power

graduates

 

SEQUEL TO HONOR SYSTEM

Cheating at Examinations Almost

Years

Princeton, Felt. Ill—«Princeton L’ui-
\'t‘l‘\ll)’ this work took a long: Step to-
ward complete student control of the
morals of the nudergradualrs when
the Faculty unanimously approrrd a
resolution giving to the Senior Coun-
cil, the student governintr hody sc-
lcclcd hy lllt' undergraduates, power
of dismissal from the university
without a statement of cause to the
Discipline Committee or any other
hotly connected with the Faculty.
The Princeton Senior Council under
this rulng will have power to deal
umnolcstcd and without reporting anv
evidence with any cases which in
their estimation “ tend to lower the
inor'al tone and good name of Prince—
on

President llihhcn today issued a
statement commending the new plan.

The resolution adopted hy the Fac~
ulty on the subject requires a three-
quarters umjnriu' oi the Council role
to convict a student.

That the crring undergraduate will
find no easy Jury to [ace him when
he is brought to trial by the fifteen
members of the Council is to he seen
from the severe nature of the penal-
ties which are always inflicted by the
undergraduates. ‘Dean h’lcCleuahau,
In'eonnnentinf.r on the new rule, said:

"Their'attitude toward their fel-
low-students is exactly what one
would expect. They are, on the

 

whole, more severe in their judg-
ments titan are the members of the
“acuity, and are even more hlood-
thirsty than f.”

This drastic action is the result of
the gradual development of the
Princeton honor syslem, L‘stzihlishtad
twenty—eight years ago. Under this
system all examinations are c n-
ducth without i’acnlty supch n,
and the student is at liberty to talk
with others during the examination,
or even to leave the examination
hall for a smoke or to get the morn‘
int: mail at his room, the onir t‘c-
slrirtion livingr a signed plat of
honesty at the end of the paper. .\

in the entire [\t'cttly'ciglil years “ thr

esty lltiplll almost he collated on the
lingers of two hands.” in the rltlllli
statement the Dean, who was an inn
derm‘adualc at. the time of tth in~
rcption of the honor system, duhht-d
crihhinty as "one of i'riucctrm's la-
vnritc indoor sports” prior to this
time.
