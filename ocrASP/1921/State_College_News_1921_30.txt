Summary: Score at half time,
State, It); Clarkson, 6. Referee,
Sisson. liouls committed, Clark-
son, 9; State, 8. Time of periods,
twenty-ﬁve minutes.

St. Lawrence started out with a
whirlwind attack in the Saturday
night tilt, and scored live points hc«
fore Stale got hcr hearings, The
Purple and Gold, however, tight-
cncd ils defensive and opened up
an offensive which took the St.
Lawrence live off their feet and
gave State a tl‘lrcc—point lead. This
advantage did not change until
near the cud 0f the half when St.
Lawrence spurted and Lied the
score at 12 all. Cassavant broke
this deadlock in favor of State with
a long shot, but Weller came
through for the home team even-
ing things up again. The score rc-
nntincd tied at 14 all until the and
o. Il'lC period.

The second half opened with
some fast lloorwork. State worked
up a thrcc-point lead. but lost it
after about seven minutes play
when St. Lawrence forged ahead
by 5 points. Baker started a rally
for State when he dropped in a
clean basket from the middle of
the court. \Vith the score 25 to
21 in favor of the home team,
Johnson was fouled while shoot-
ing. The goal was counted, and
Cassavant made good on the two
foul tries, ticing the score. lla—
thorn sent State to the front again
from the field. St Lawrence licd‘
again on a long shot and score rc—
maincd at 27 all until the final
whistle. Towards the end of the
half l’olt was fouled out on per—
sonals, and Dobris replaced him
at guard.

In the extra ﬁve minutes the fast
game of the night before, and the
speedy pace set by' the St. aw—
rcnce team had its effect. State’s
defensive went to pieces, and the
home team was able to score seven
points in quick succession. The
best the Purple and Gold could do
was one foul shot, and they were
forced to admit defeat by a count
of 34 to 27.

Weller and Barker were the big
guns for St. Lawrence. Cassa-
vant and Hathorn played a hang-up
game for State

strenuous appliance to either golf

Inauguratitm was the subject of
thc linal Scene. The hand, the
cabinet, ilignilicd, as well as un—
diguilicd friends, the old maid, and
the tense were all tlu-ru. liven
Cox, though mentally (lcrangcd,
did his share by selling “extras.”
During,r the parade the wife 0f lhc
|.‘rcsiclcnt as liclitting one of llCl'
importance was drawn about by
coach and four. The judge so im-
pressed Hardin}.r that he not only
kissed the “lliblc,” but read his
favorite passages. The inaugural
speech was voted :1 great success,
but the crowd could say with Hard-
ing, “ Darucd, if I know, do you?”

The stunt CUlllmlllt'v included
Dorothy Dungrmnond, Grace Ma-
guirc, Gladys llayncr, Maybelle
Jochnmscll. Adrian Johnson, and
Charles Reilly.

The committee thanks the class
for its cooperation in making the
stunt a success.

WIRELESS CONCERT

to jazz. Undcr the cxpcrt manipu-
lation of Mr. Long lhc Ht't' was
lulu-d so that the high, clcar notes
of AllllC. (ialli—t'urci, soprano, the
full rich tones of Iiniilio Dc inr—
grirza, baritone. and the noisy con-
Lrlomcration of sounds produced by
the Dixieland Jazz Band were
heard as distinctly as if the Vic-
trola were in the mom. One of the
operators announced each selcc~
lion llUTOl'C it was given. The pro-
gram was wrll balanced with
classical, semi-classical and popular
music.

After the Concert was over. most
of those present waited till 10
o'clock to the got the correct time
signal from the navy station at
Arlington, Va. Following this the
reports of weather conditions along
the Atlantic coast were received.
A few college students who were
present decided to [ind the limit of
audibility of the signals, Accord-
ing to them the signals could be
plainly heard in the auditorium.
This fact is remarkable and shows
the rapid advance that has been
made along wireless lincs since the
war.

An event of this sort is a novelty
to State College, but it is hoped
that more students will become in—
tcrcstcd. At future concerts there

should be a greater number of col-I

legc people present to enjoy this
secmin miracle of science. Much
credit is due to Mr. Long and the
other members of the Physics Des
partmcnt for their cnahllnn‘ State
College to have a real wireless sta-
tion of its own.
