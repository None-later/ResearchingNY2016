PHYSICAL EDUCATION

'l'hc proposed change in the tics
partmcnt of l'hysical fidnration rc-
ported in the l: t issue of the
News" is necessitated by a re-
action in State policy. The war
clearly showcd tlic nccc‘sity of
health education, and thc ptihlic
schools attacked their new problem
with vigor and good hope of suc-
cess. Ncw York State was prompt
in providinir nlcdical inspection of
school children and systematic

 

 

physical trainng from the kinilcr—
gartcn through th

e High School.
The work in pliy ~ -’ ' ,r was
especially well organized and ex—
tended to the rcmotcst school
house in the State. t'ity and coun-
try child shared equally in the
benefits of the recreational and
physical activities.

The present reaction undonbh
t-dly aris from the fact that too
iuttch was attempted at once. The
rural co-iniminitics do not accept
the doctrine of prescribed cxcrcise
kindly. l’arm chores and the long
walk to and from s hoof appear to
make. physical training unneces-
sary. The large c.‘ nditure for
supervision and nistration of
physical education in these rural
communities has therefore caused
much unfavorable criticism and the
demand for rcirt-ucluncnt became
insistent.

The State College c/ursc in
Physical Education was enlarged
in 1918 to provide for the training
of special teachers and supervisors
in response to the State demand for
such training. President llrubachcr
says the work of the department
has been exceptionally successful.
“The staff of teachers has been
notably efficient and their profes-
sional enthusiasm has been vcry
hirzh" in the president’s opinion.
"But." as. he further says, I’thc
technical work was given to satisfy
a speciﬁc demand for specialists,
and much as I regret it, it must be
modified for the present, because
that demand is withdrawn. l have
great satisfaction. however, in the
fact that the efficient gymnasium
staff can be retained and used in
the regular College work and that

it has been said that the best
stories ever written have brcn
thrown into a waste basket. Some
which have been rejected by mic
editor or published have been ac»
rented by another as masterpieces.
Finding a market in this way is a
matter of luck, for it is certain that
other stories just as good have
been thrown into the discard and
lost forever. On a newspaper you
will write something that will be

away. This will happen and you
will feel hurt. but there is a swcct
