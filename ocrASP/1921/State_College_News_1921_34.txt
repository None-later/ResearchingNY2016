:\ VCry competent suitor was on
his knees to the girl. She had rc-
iused him. but still he remained.

“Really, I cannot," she added.
“And lest some one may come in

ram.

" Do you ever take anythng when
you get chilled and soaked through

“ 'Vell. wait here in the vestihulc
a moment," said the philanthropist
as she opened the door of her house
and vanished, to reappear a moment
later.

“ Here, my poor man,“ she said,
putting a small envelope in the
man's outstretched hand. “These
are two-grain quinine pills; you take
him of them now and two more in
half an hour.”
