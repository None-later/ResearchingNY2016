there is no rcason for our unwill-

and faithful practicing, you. too,
might become a member of this
select little group. (fan it be that
you arc afraid to ask to come to
rehearsals? Don’t wait to be
coaxed. We say coaxed, because
you have already been invited to
come.

Everyone knows it is not lack
of musical talent that is our draw-
back. There are at least lifty pco-

THE POLITICAL SCIENCE
CLUB

Only one ycar ago. a great many
students interested in public and
political administration and matters
pertaining to such. exhibich this
interest by m‘ganizing a Political
Science Club in State College. if
it is true that all good things die

young. all is well, but broad-
mtndcd State College students
know better and therefore look

with hopeful eyes to a revival of
this interest.

it was with great pride that the
Political Science Club was organ-
ized last year by the class of '20,
for it was chieﬂy through its efforts
that the organization succeeded.
Are we as students now to rc'ect
the ideals of the class of ’20? erc
their eﬁorts in vain? No, not so,
for there are still in college those
whose initiative has already
brought the organization to life.
Juniors. yes. charter members of
the club, are striving to follow the
example of their sister class, They
hope ~that all interested in political
science will join the club. History
majors and minors, here’s an op-
portunity to give and get some

 

to further the ideals set before us.

TRADITJ ONS

l'i'rhaps soun- \\'ill say that wr
:tri- like thr rims» who played sale
by always telling his men to do
snlllL'llllllL' “in-r he saw that they
had already startvd to do it. when
we start to tall; about traditions
again, lint we are not going to
proposi- that old traditions be
lx'cpl~llit.‘ mpportcrs of the l‘urplc
and (laid have shown that they
\villwrmly that now traditions bc
made. Furthermore we believe
that the saying, ” Strike while the
iron is hot.” though old and trite.
IS too true to be thrown in the
waste-paper basket.
so may we suggest that perhaps
while we are standing so ﬁrmly
behind our colors and our ring,
there are some other things which
would make line college traditions.
For-example, what about a really
traditional Alma Mater. as was
suggested recently in chapel? it
has been reported that at Alumni
meetings the song leader is
ashamed to ask for the Alma
Matcrbecausc it brings forth such
a variety of tunes. And a ain.
what about making a real tradition
out of that resolution to leave books
and papers outside of chapel? We
ave. noticed that students are
starting to fall down in this already.
nd lastly and most important of
all, maybe, why not get ‘hchi (1 Dr.
ompson and the music repart-
Inent and make such chapel exer—
cises as wore presented last Fri~
