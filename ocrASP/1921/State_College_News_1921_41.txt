DR. BRUBACHER SPEAKS

befOrc the Parents' Association of
the Glovcrsville schools on “Co-
operative Education."

RAH FOR STATE COL-
LEGE

Are some State College people
ashamed of their Alma Mater?
They seem to the, but why? We
have a president and dean who are
beyond any reproach. Our faculty
cannot be equaled. They have Phi
Beta Kappa keys, good dispositions
and all the necessary requirements.
ii We were to do everything they
tell us we would khaw lots more

than the graduates of some of the

 

“ famous " colleges. If you think
State has no silt-it go to a gante
and hear us yo I. As to friends-—
State Inns it all over any other col-
lege for friendliness. Every one
knows every one else, and what is
more, likes them, too. If you don't
enjoy the lproud times State has its
your own anlt. Wake up, you pen-
plc who don't realize what a. line
Alma Mater you have; you never
could have a better one if you
searched the world over. Wake up
and shout the praises of the best
college lhcrc is—your own 5. LI. ‘I‘.

THEIR ~iiESIsi‘ING
VIEWS

 

How many of you upper class-
meu saw the demonstration given
by the freshman class after chapel
on Friday, when their men were
presented with caps by the sopho-
Illnl'c president? A line showing.
wasn't it? Are we to allow such
poor sportsmanship to get a start
in State College? It has not ex-
istcd here before, and are, wc going
to let the class of '24 inlrudnce it?
It would be discrt-ditablt- to us as
chl as to then) to fall down in this
respect. Iirosh, it's not that we
don‘t like to hear from you (met: in
a while. \thn you get a brilliant
thought and think you have somc~
thing good to give us for example,
a good debate or b kutbull gumc,
we're glad to H it. That's
what we call trying to have the
proper inﬂuence on lhuse about
you.

If, however, you think that this
new rapcr of yours which has to do
with breaking rnlh-ge tradition is a
good one. We shall have in elevate.
your ideals and rid you of these
had thollghls. II is only cuunnon.
you know, for the green, iu-com-
ing class in be taught a lesson or
two from their elders, so you're
not out of the ordinary afler all as
ar falling below in your stand-
ards is concerned.

Now, uppvr clussmcu, look after
these lmsh. It’s true that Ihey
must have felt very strange and
timid upon lirst mining to colicgc
and tried In make a good impres-
sion. but let's not allow them to
get too good a start with these re-
sisting views. ’23.
NEW BILL REQUIRES

Assembly Passes Halpern Measure;
“Fool Bill," Says Donahue

If the Halpcrn bill. which the As.
scmhiy passed yesterday by a vote
of 98 to 3!. becomes law, teachers
in the ptrhlic schools will be, re—
quircd to take an oath of allegiance
before beginning their work. ()p-
position to the measure was led by
Minority Leader Douohuzt, who
tcrincd it “a fool bill."

“ I was inclined to think the hys-
teria which prevailed last year,
in this chamber especially, had
passed.” he said. “It wottld seem
that, unless a man wraps a flag
around his body he is not an
American."

Assemblyman Ralph Halpcru.
Republican of Queens, said the
legislation would provide an avenue
to get “those teachers out of the
schools ” who have no respect for
American institutions. lle charged
there were teachers in New York
City on the public payroll who dis-
regarded tllc ideals and institutions
of the State and nation.

Under a bill, introduced by As-
semblyman F. W. Judson, Repub-
lican of Monroe, which the Assem-
bly approved. Albany is granted
power to establish a purchasing

 

department or agency. Another
Judson measure, pnssctl yesterday.
would provide for the creation of
a dcpartnunn of health in second
and third class cities of the State
to replace the 1'II'Cstllll hoards of
health,
