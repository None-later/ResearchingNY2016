MR. CHESTERTON'S
FAVORITES

 

Gilbert K. Chesterton said that
if he were to he marooned on a
desert isle he would take with him
three books to relieve his loneli-
ness, namely, the HibIE, Shakes-
peare's plays and Dickens’ "Pick—
wick Papers." This third choice
of Mr. Cliesterton’s has not been

passed by without criticism. Here

are one critic's views:

 

its. a perennial booster of
t‘haries Dickens, of course, Mr.
Chesterton would take some
I.)il‘l(l‘ll3 work or other. And while
‘lJaVid t.'lip|iei'licld' or ‘l.larnahy

than ' l'ieltwit‘le'
