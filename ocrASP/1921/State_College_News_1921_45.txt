We regret the illness of the
JEditor-in-Chicl‘, l". Reginald Bruce.
Mr. Bruce has been out of college
for over three weeks, “is condi—
tion is improving and it is expected
that he will be able to return soon.

 

.l‘o the Editor of the “News”:

My Dear Slit—The freshman
class, that is the girls of the class,
are to be congratulated upon the
unusual and attractive stunt which
was presented by them to the stu-
dent body in the chapel on April I.

The ycarliugs did certainly give
us the surprise treat which they
promised. It was an entirely diflcr-
font type of class stunt, These little
1924‘s are not so green or not so
inactive as the snpbs would have
lls believe.

The men's committee of ‘24 did
slightly more than its share so far
as their Stunt is concerned. It is
really a shame that such unusual
talent as that demonstrated by the
men of ’24 should be wasted on a
college audience. Why do they not
join the Columbia circuit and ap-
pear in such theatres as the Empire
where their extraordinarily clcvcr
talent as well as their consummate
ncrvc would be more apprecialcd.

Perhaps it- is our fault that we
con't appreciate the last part of the
performance, but it seems that it
would have been better for State
and for 1924 had the fresh stunt
closed with the impressive banner
scene.

From what we've said, .\lr. Editor,
do not get the idea that we don’t
like our 1924 men. Quite to the
contrary. We think they are a
Inightly line crowd. \Vc think also
that there is a limit and trust that
the men‘s stunt is merely an evi-
dence of the extreme folly of youth.

Yours for State College,

 

The Dramatics and Art Associa-
tion have changed the date of the
pre‘sentatiou of its play from May
28, :This recent communication rc-
ecivcd by the Editor proves that
this change will be appreciated by
the students.

Dear Editor:

In the last issue of the "News"

the dramatics class announced that

the would sings their play May
28t 1. Now ‘May 28 is on the Satur-
day night which comes within our
Decoration Day vacation. Without
doubt the dramatics class never
thought of that, and yet they really
should have because it is the self
same blunder that they made last
year. Of course all of the students
‘cannot take advantage of such a
short vacation, but many can, and
many do. Perhaps those who do
are not even a majority of the
student body but at any rate they
are a considerable minorit , a min-
ority which very much eels that
they should have the chance of see-
ing these plays wlthout having to
give up their vacation.

it were a basketball gamc,'or
an ordinary party given by some
one of the organizations or clubs, no
one would especially object, because
there are plenty of others of the
kind. But we have a chance to sec
tbc (lramatics class plays just twice
each year. They are alwuys well
attended. They are a thin},r that the
student body looks forward to with
no ordinary expectation and prom-
isc of delight. And the possibility
of either missing them or its vaca-
tion is a thing that the student body
looks forward to with no ordinary
apprehension. It looms up like a
decider] catastrophe.

But the date is the 28111, Saturday
evening. ii the 26th or 27th is not
taken we wonder if it would he too
much to ask the dramatics class to
rush their preparations by twenty-
fonr hours or so. Even if it were
liriday night, almost any loyal
State (Iollcg‘ccr would be willingr lo
sacrillcc that much of his vacation
for the chalice and pleasure of sec-
ing “ A ' ‘bouszind Years Ago.”
it does rather see as tho' il were
a reasonable request and might be
arranged, doesn’t it.

H. E. SENIORS VISIT
WEIDMAN, WARD & CO.

 

A most interesting and instructive
visit to the wholesale house of
Weidman, Ward & Co. was re-
cently enjoyed by the seniors oi
the Home Economics Department.
The visit included the inspection of
the entire building, together with
explanations in detail as to the
methods employed throughout.
Talks were given by Mr. Ward, one
of the heads of the ﬁrm, and by
Mr. Tictchnm, the tea and coffee
expert,

Acquaintance with the establish—

 

ment gave cvtdence of airport plan-
ning both in construction of the

 

 

 

building and in the methods em-
ployed in the handling of goods.
The building being located directly
beside the railroad tracks eliminates
transportation charges, while the
system by which goods are received
through one door and discharged
through another eliminates conges-
tion and- waste of time in handling.
.l-iydraulic conveyors enable one
man to move immense loads of
goods from the receiving door to
any place on the same floor, while
spiral chutes and elevators each
opening into a room on either side
make transportation from one ﬂoor
to another simple and rapid. In
addition to efﬁciency in system and
equipment the building,r is also sup-
plch with etllcicncy in the form of
safety devices.

it is as nearly fireproof as pos-
sible, being built of brick and hav-
ing concrete iloors. Protection
from fire is insured by automatic
sprinklers, together with an auto-
matic lire gong and a device for
closing doors in order to prevent
ﬁre from being drawn up the stair-
way.

One of the most important duties
of the wholesale house is the re-
ceiviug and shipping oi tea and
coffee. The coffee is roasted on the
top floor of the building and is
tested, graded, and blended by the
tea and coffee expert. The packing
department in operation demon-
strates thc indispensability of the
wholesaler, for it is from this dc-
partment that goods are shipped to
merchants unable for ﬁnancial rea‘
sons and lack of storage space to
buy in large quantity from the pro-
ducer. Goods from all parts of the
world are received and shipped by
this establishment.

Efﬁciency is obviously the key-
note of the establishment. Time,
energy and money are intelligently
concerned with ultimate benefit to
the consumer as a result of reduced
costs.
