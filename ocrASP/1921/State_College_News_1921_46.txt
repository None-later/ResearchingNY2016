LEARY PUTS UNION
COLLEGE THROUGH
SPRING GRID WORK

Union College of Schenectady is
not going to be caught napping
next fall when the football Season
gets underway. Coach Perry Leary
arrived unexpectedly at the college
during- the week and sent out a call
for football candidates. Thirty incn
responded. among them several vet—
erans, and they were put to work
chasng the pigskin, puntng and
tackling.

At thc opening of tho IOZU season
the coach found a lot of incxperi»
cnccd material and tho schedule was
pretty well advanced before the
squad found itself and bcuan to
show the steam and opposition of
other Union teams. By means of
spring practice the men will be
thoroughly grounded in the rudi-
ments of the game and will be ready
in the fall to begin team work,
signal practice and the study of
formations. _

John H. Murray, Jr” is captain of
the 1921 team and will have several
veterans with him and plenty of
good material to draw from. The
team will feel the loss of Captain

 

Gregory llomer Gall, Brucker and
Jones. all powerful men in the line
and backfield last year. Coach
Leary left the college at the end of
the week and practice was left in the
hands of Captain Murray.

COLGATE IN SPRING
GRIDIRON PRACTICE

Hamilton, April l7.—~’.‘l‘hc spring
football practice of the Colgate Uni-
versity eleven opened yesterday
with liftccn men in unilorm. Most
at“ the early aspirants for positions
on next fall's varsity were of the
lresllman class, but it is expected
that the squad will be doubled this
week by the addition of loolball
melt who at present are on the
lacrosse and baseball squads.

l'ractice was staged under the
supervision of Dr. E. C. Hunting-
ton, director of Colgate athletics,
Manager l’hilip Jackson of Bullalo,
and Captain Bob Webster, who was
not in uniform but; led the squad in
the lip-ht workout consisting of
kicking, passing the ball, and break-
ing away. No tackliui,r or bucking
the line was undertaken, and it is
not expected that any strenuous
form of practice will he indulged in
before the arrival of Ellery llunt«
iucton, head coach of the Colgate
eleven.

Amour,r the men in uniform were:
Dourly, a hugh 25f] poundcr from
New York, who has played in the
lirowu hacklicld in recent years,
and who has quite a reputation as
a plunging fullback, Ray Burke, the
lilllt' ball back from ltoslon, who
played a sensational name for thc
Maroon last fall; Stan Vosc,
weighty guard. who was one of the
main‘ ays of the Colgate line last
season; and liabc Kraus, another
huge fullback.

'l‘bu sclcrtion of the permanent
varsity nine by Coach llill Reid of
the baseball team to open the Col—
;xati- diamond season to»morr0\'.'
with 'l‘tlfts will undoubtedly release
many of the football mcn who have
been working under him.

The professor undoubtedly had an

In order to show a modern ap-
plication of the discoveries of the
alchemists, the audience 15 al-
lowed to sec a “blind tiger joint"
conductcd by a rough looking,r in—
dividunl named Strain. The wines
were d guised as watcr, but could
he ch’ h- d to their original form
when needed. Three. persons in the
audience were thirsty enough to call
for some of the beverage. Their
names are withheld from publica—
tion in order that they may not get
into trouble with the prohibition

.\ftcr this exhibition a line or-
cbt-stra struck up a “jazzy” tulle,
and the audit-nee turned their thots
to dancing. Meanwhile members
oi the ('hrmislry Club had booths
for the sale of ice cream cones and
“ pop." At other booths those who
desired could have silhouettes made
or their palms read.

The party was a distinct novelty
and made a favorable impression
on every one who attended. The
persons who aided in the entertain-
ment and the entire Cbemntry Club
membership deserve great praise
im- oiving a real good timc. Tt is
hoped that there will he more of
these parties in the future.
