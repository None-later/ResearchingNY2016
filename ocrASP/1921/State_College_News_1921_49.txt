ARE COLLEGE DAYS
BEST DAYS?

Our friends, who are a great deal
older than we are, tell us our col-
legc days are the best days of our
lives. We think that perhaps they
are right, for they have lived longer
than we have, but we cannot really
believe that their statements are
quite true. We argue that the
future~the dim, far-off time when
all our dreams are to be realized,
so we hope-must hold more for
us than the present does.

hcthcr our college days are
our best days, or whether they are
only foundation stones upon which
we plan to build a wonderful future,
the necessity of getting the most
out of them is just the same. At
college we learn to understand and

 

to appreciate, to some extent at
least, things that were before only
names to us. We find that it is
really the fair play spirit that
makes athletics worth while. lint
aside from tlieso things—the ones
we usually stress .ioo much—ii we
make even one or two real friends
while we are in college. We have
done a great deal towards making
our life there successful. For,
after all, is it not our friends that
do so much to make things pleasant
for us, in school and afterwards?
To have friends, one must be a
friend, of course. This implies our
need of sympathy, consideration,
and kindly interest for otir fricnds’
welfare. if we all tried to cultivate
these qualities, what a spirit of
friendliness would pervade our col-
lege. Do you think that anyone
would ever mourn because‘tliei'c
was too friendly n spirit here.’ We
are friendly—but let’s be even
more so.

THE DAILY PAPER ‘

Did you ever think of our var-
ious bulletin boards as comprising
a daily college newspaper in which
each board represents a page or
section?

The topics of general interest to
all students are written upon the
lirst page which may be read upon
entering the front door. Club and
class meetings are announced with
big headlines. News telegraphed
from the business ollicc announc-
ing the arrival of scholarship
money, or from the college doctor,
summoning some to appear for ex-
amination, or from the dean, news
of this type from our college no-
torities may be read on the lirst

page.

The crime column is found on
the second sheet. Fortunately, this
is very short, consisting only of
the freshman penalty list. published
by the sophomores.

On the page of social activities
we read of the coming prom,
soircc, or party.

The latest opportunities for cin-
ploynient are listed also on one of
the lil‘Sl pages. This section is
very popular with the seniors.
Everybody in college reads at least
these pages.

' hen if you (lid not have lime
to read your paper at home before
coming to school you may lind cur-
rent cvents upon the history lnil-
lctin board. An interesting edi—
torial column is also conducted
here.

If you are interested in science
and invention, you may read on the
physics and chemistry bulletin
boards of the wireless station re-
ccntly set up in the science build—
ing or of the “ llarnionc.”

Religious activities are
lished through the Y. W. C. A. and
Newman Club bulletin boards.

' hc Sport settion posts news
about basketball games, gym
frolics, W. A, A. hikes, and swim-
ming.

On the advertising page we have
the “Lost and Fonm " section. the
section where the Co-op Book
Store announces its latest books,
and a section where the cafeteria
lists its menu.

To you who have not been ac-
customed to reading our bulletin
boards we say wake up to the op-
portunity of getting acquainted
with every phase of college ac-
tivity in this way.

LARGE DEMAND
FOR COMMERCIAL
TEACHERS

The demand for college trained
commercial teachers has never been
greater than at present. ’i‘o—day
thert are 704 high school coin-
‘lili positions in 207 different

   

inerc ,
public schools in the State outside
of New .York City. These posi-
tions olfei' salaries ranging from
$l,l00 to $3,500 accordin r to train-
ing and experience. Tiat school
authorities are anxious to obtain
college graduates for commercial
leaching positions is reﬂected in
the calls that have come to State
College for such instructors. Of
thuse in this year's class who have
commercial teaching positions for
next year the lowest is $1,200 and
the higllicst $1,800.

The new continuation school law
pnsscd by the Legislature last year
will be an important factor in in-
creasing this demand for commer-
Clili teachers. it is estimated that
by 1925 when the law will he in
full operation, 300,000 boys and
girls of uch 14, 15, 16 and 17 years
will be enrolled in the part-time
school. Of this 300,000 at least
25% or 75,000 will be commercial
students. Add this 75,000 to the
50,000 now enrolled in one or more
ColllilllCI'Ciili subjecls iii the all-(lay
public schools, and one gets some
conception of bin: tremendous op«
portunity that is developingr for
the commercial teacher in the
future.

AFTER VACATION

Now that our brief vacation has
come illiii ﬂOIlL‘ \VC Ell'C Once more
settled down to our college work.
.However, with the yet distant, but
inevitable linal examinations in the
backs of our minds, there is danger
that some of us are going to be too
settled. it is true that there is al—
ways plenty to be done and social
affairs should not detract too much
from the accomplishment of the
fundamental purpose of our pres-
once licre. Nevertheless, there is
one thing for which we should—
wc must take time. That is out-
of: doors recreation. One may
think that no urging is necessary
on this point, but many are the peo-
ple who are within doors at their
books when the most beautiful
hiking weather is waiting to be en-
Joyed. This is just the best season
of the year. Choose your way of
making the most of it! Remember.
the busmst people have time for
lots of things, and those assign-
ments will go twice as last after
you have breathed in a copious
amount of fine. fresh oxygen.

 

 

MISS FUTTERER READS
“ QUALITY STREET ”

Last Tuesday evening in the col-
lege auditorium, Miss intlcrcr
read James M. Barrie’s "Quality
Street " to a large and appreciative
audience.

" Quality Street " is a whimsical
comedy that has about all the frag-
rance of an old-fashioned English

 

ardeii. it carries one far away
rom this work-a-dny world. yet suc-
ceeds in keeping its readers close
to its people that have the appeal
of realism softened by the gentle
charm that is Barrie’s.

The play is laid in the period of
the Napoleonic wars and is writ-
ten about two women, Miss Susan
and Miss Phoebe, whose standards
of ideal womunlincss llli most of
their thoughts. Miss Susan, the
elder by ten years, is the nnder<
standing heart to whom Phoebe
COIIiitiCS her love for the dashing
Valentine Brown. When he goes
away to the wars, all unsuspectin
that the little ladies had cxpecte
him to offer himself to Phoebe.
they decide to hide this as well as
the fact that they have lost tiic half
of the income which had been iii-
vested at his instigation. When
the dashing Captain Brown comes
back after an absence of ten years,
he is surprised to find his flower-
gardcn girl an old. care-worn
teacher. But Phoebe has kept her
wedding dress. the gift of Susan,
and at times she dressed in it to
make a fairy picture of the girl of
the flower garden. Now, she
masquerades in it as Miss Libby. a
niece of Plidcbc's. By licr modern
airs and graces. she is such it con-
trast to the captain's picture of
Phoebe as a girl that he cannot
but love the tired, but womanly,
teacher. The soldier secs through
the scheme and when all explana-
tions are made, Phoebe finds she
does not hate hint at all but that
she still loves him.

“Quality Street" is the type of
play that Miss liiittcrcr docs ex-
ceptionally well—perhaps it is but
cause her voice has in it the same
sort of charm that Barrie's plays
have, or perhaps it is because she
is so natural, so unaffected in all
her work. Her reading was en-
joyed by all, and students. fac-
lllty, and our outside friends join
with the "Knickerbocker Press "
in saying Miss Futtercr has added
another success to her long list of
achievements in dramatic reading.

MAY MUSIC FESTIVAL

 

In May will occur the ﬁrst An-
nual Spring Concert of the
Women’s Chortis of State Col-
lege. Dr. Thompson, head of the
music department, will conduct and
Dr. Candlyn, a composer of note
and assistant in the department,
will be at the piano. The concert
promises not only to be particularly
worth while but most unusual.
Numbers by such composers as
Grieg, Gounod. Tschaikowsky, and
others of like rank will be sung.

Vc all know what the chorus
can do. having heard them sing bee
fore the Albany Alumni, at the
Hamilton Concert, and twice be-
fore the stnrlcnt body in chapel.
Each of these four minor appear-
ances has demonstrated to us the
remarkable progress the chorus is
making along the lines of tone.
quality and technique.

The chorus is rapidly pushing
State forward musically. Let us
all back to the limit this our ﬁrst
May Music Festival.
