THE RESERVE
BASKETBALL TEAM

 

It was for the purpose of keeping
those basketball players who came
out for practice regularly but who
were not skillful enough to he
placed on the varsity squad, inter-
ested in playing and perfecting
themselves that a reserve schedule
was originated this year through
the efforts of Coach Snavcly and
assistant manager, Edward Linck.

At the beginning of the year the
team was organized, Edward
Shirley being elected captain and
Edward Linck being assigned to
the management of the reserves.

The line-up varied as new players
entered and was often weakened as
good players dropped out or were
taken for use in the varsity games.
Linck, J. Cassavant and Shirley held
the forward positions. Baldwin and
Donahue took turns at center while
Reilly and Strain were thc foremost
guards. Flynn and Neuncr were
also on the squad and later Mac-
Farlane, Dooley and Rutinan be-
came strong competitors for posi-
tions on the team. Linck and
Shirley were the principle point
getters for the team.

The games played were:

Jan. 7. R. P. 1. Reserves at Troy.
22. St. Joseph’s Academy at
’ State.

Feb. 5. Milne High School Varsity

at State.
10. Milne High School Varsity

a in e.
24. St. Joseph's Academy at
St. Joseph’s Academy.
Mar. 5. Rensselaer High School at
Rensselaer.
12. R. P. 1. Reserves at State.
Although the team was several
times defeated it has shown great
progress and cﬁiciency in signals
and passwork. The hard games
played and heavy training has put
great vigor in the players, prepar-
ing them in the best possible way
for varsity positions next year. It
has also started great enthusiasm
for a second basketball team as well
as a ﬁrst at State College. It is
hoped that with this start even a
larger and better program may be
prepared for next year's reserve
team.

 

OUTDOOR BASEBALL
PRACTICE STARTS
WITH VIM

 

With the basketballs carefully
packed away for next winter. and
the robins chirping cheerfully in
the campus elms, Coach Snavely
has led forth his band of husky
pill swatters for the ﬁrst outdoor

 

 

practice. Mitch interest is being
taken in the development of this
year’s nine, for with the students
backng baseball stronger than ever
before, and with a better schedule
than usual prepared by Manager
llill, this year’s record may put
the all-American sport in line for
a major place at State College,

As a nucleus about which to form
a good combination are: Hathoru,
’ . Cassavan-t. Johnson, Bliss,
Hakcs, Sherlock. and Baker of last
year's squad. Johnson will be in
the box again this year with Bliss
and l'lathorn as relief pitchers.
The position behind the bat will be
taken care of with Hakes, the
veteran of last year’s team, and
Dooley, a new-comer. “ Short ”
Hathorn will undoubtedly
sway over ﬁrst. but he has a strong
contender in Debris, who regularly
plays ﬁrst. ‘

J. Cassavant, Bliss, Sherlock, and
Carrolan are in line for second and
short. 11 of them are experienced
men and Coach will have no difﬁ-
culty in keeping these positions
well su plied. Third base will be
ably he (1 down by Captain "Tice"
Cassavant, one of the mainstays of
last year.

In the outﬁeld will he Holmes,
Osborne, Hill, acFarlane, and
Baldwin, supplemented by some of
the squad.

Coach Snavely has put the men
through some light batting drill,
and a lot of practice in ﬁelding in
order to st them used to the feel
of the ba 1. He is going slow in
the elimination process, and the
very evident ability of all candi-
dates makes it plain that only the
hardest possible work will earn a
berth on the team.

The ﬁrst tilt will take place
April 23 at Ridgeﬁeld Park with
St. Stephen's as the attraction.
Last vear State defeated St.
Stephen’s in the ﬁrst game bv an
overWhelming score, but it is
known that St. Stephen's has excel-
lent material this yrar. and only a
"bane-up " ﬂood exhibition of base—
ball will enable the Purple and Gold
to carry off the honors this time.

jUNIOR SISTERS

The enteringr class each year is
fortunate in the greeting tendered
them by the juniors. In the sum<
mer preceding the coming of the
freshmen each iunior writes to a
prospective student, and oﬂ'ers as-
sistance in any way possible—-
such as securing a hoarding place.
meeting the new strident at the
train. etc. Later the iuniors ac-
quaint the freshmen with the point:
of interest about the college and

‘the city. and act as general guardi-

ans until the freshmen become ac-
chmated.
