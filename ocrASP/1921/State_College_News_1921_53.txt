WOMEN’S ATHLETIcs
ASSOCIATION

 

The future of girls' athletics in
State College depends greatly on
the incoming classes for the next
two years. in recent years, atlILctics
have won a place of more or less
prominence among the girls, but
since the physical education depart-
ment is being taken from the col-
lege all the more interest should be
centered in the major sport, basket-
ball, and the girls’ athletics in gen-
era.

At present athletics are directed
by the Woman’s Athletic Associa-
tion. The Association is supported
by nominal dues and an appropria—
tion from the student tax fund.

The biggest feature of girls“ ath-
lctics is an interelass basketball
tournament held during the winter
months on the indoor court. Two
classes are played between each two
classes, totalling twelve games.
The winning claSs receives chain-
pionship honors. ’

With the close of the basketball
season the teams are glad to an-
nounce the champion team this year.
the senior team. For the second
time the team of '21 are proud to
hold this honor. It is very unusual
for a senior team to win the cham-
pionship because for lack of inter-
est, spirit or players in its last year,
the team falls down. The seniors
should be highly commended for the
spirit that t cy have kept for their
team, class, and college. They have
had regular practice weekly, with
practically every member of the
squad present each time. All six
games played by the senior team
were won with the best sportsman-
ship that could possibly be shown.

Letters are awarded members of
the champion team and numerals to
all those who have played three full
or seven half games. There is a
great deal of rivalry between the
classes over the teams they put for-
ward.

The line-up of this year’s teams is
as follows:

Senior Team —

Lucile Rouse, captain

Beulah Cunningham, manager
Winifred Darling

Jessie Darling

Frances Lawrence

GYM FROLICS

'41 —— I

The frolics'are thcqttiairs fostered
by W. A' . most universally at-
tended. Everybody come prepared
to have a good time. and they have
litl Dean Pierce comes and smiles

licve she has as good a time as the
rest of us. The entertainment each
time consists of singing. vaudeville
stunts, games. or races. Every per-
son forgets her'dignity‘and plays
hard. Pop-corn, cider, peanuts, or
lolly-pops are served.

 

SKATING

 

The park lake and our hockey
rink on the campus furnish excellent
places for skating. This year the
girls who were majors and minors
in physical education were also
taught the rudiments of iee'hockcy.
if the ice had lasted longer prohahly
a girls’ team would have been
started.

TENNIS

Spring is coming! Yes, indeedl
Old winter caught her without her
snow shovel and stalled her for
awhile, but snow shovels are not al—
ways in order and spring will come.

Then out will come the tennis
rackets. W. A. A. girls are off to
the courts to practice for the tourn—
ament. . Queer how that ball will
pcrsrst in going everywhere except
over the net. A little patience and
the old cleverness and strength in
your wrist will come back.

The spring tennis tournament is
another big event for W. A. . A
silver cup is awarded the winner.
It you play tennis don‘t fail to sign
up. Every girl in college should
know the rudiments of the game by
the end of her freshman year.
There is a net in the gym that any-
one is welcome to use. Do not
leave college without having felt the

exhilarating effects of that best ole
sports—tennis. There are several
good courts in the park as well as
ours' right here on the campus.

 

W. A. A. ofﬁcers this year are:
Lela Cackener, ‘22 president; Wini-
fred Darling. ’2 , vice—president;
Beulah Cunningham, ’21, secretary;
Alida Curry, ’22, treasurer; [‘anline
George, '22, cheer leader.

HIKES

 

“Merrily we walk along, o'er the
rocky roads

Merrily we sing State songs. when

We ride in loads! ”

Every year W. A. A. holds two
big hikes to lndian Ladder and sew
cral smaller hikes around Albany.
These hikes are taken on Saturday
afternoons, but on the ludiau Lad<
cler hike a crowd camp out over
night and what a jolly time they do
havel Ask some who went. Sev-
eral loadsiul of girls, with lunch
boxes and cameras start off in big
trucks. Discmbarking after a very
jiggly ride, in these same trucks,
everyone takes excellent care that
the freshmen are loaded to the gun-
wales with skirts and cameras and
last but not least the lunch boxes.
The older members of the party,
mostly seniors, jog slowly up the
trail, but the underclassmen run,
each trying to out-climb the other.
it is the underelassmcn, too, who
pursue the trails at breakneck speed
to the horror of the seniors who
wish to gaze at the familiar places
for perhaps the last time. At even,
we descend the mountain tired and
dirty, but happy and content.

All out, ye who would make your
college days rich in experiences
and jolly times. Come, and hike
in the spring when young folks'
fancies lightly turn toward out-of-
doors.
