CLASS RIVALRY

 

_ Class rivalry has been expressed
Ill one way by class stunts. Each
class tries to'out-do the previous
class in putting on the Annual
Chapel Stunts.

On November 19 the seniors
started the series of stunts by pre-
senting theirs. It consisted of a
series of scenes representing the
chief holidays of the year. They
depicted very effectively New
Year’s, St. Valentine's Day. May
Day, Fourth of July, First Vaca-
tion Days. Midsummer’s Day. the
First School Day. Hallowc'cn,
Thanksgiving and Christmas.

Among the features were: Baker,
as the fisher-boy in " The First Va-
cation Day”; Gertrude Burns. as
Statute of Liberty in “The Fourth
of July." and several clever dances.
as the dance of the witches on
broomsticks and jacl<-o‘-lantern in
" l-Iallowe'en."

The performance was well
worked out under the leadership
of Amy ('lubley, chairman. and
each scene recenved a great deal
of applause.

On March ‘lth the class of ’23
did “some stunting" in their
"(‘lose-up of inauguration,” an
original play composed by Dorothy
Dangremoud. liour appmpriatc
scenes showing periods in the life
of the “man of the day” were por-
trayed by clever actors and actres~
ses.

la the first scene we were trans-
ported to the nominating conven-
tion. No one would deny that the
“green derby " and the " lapel
bouquets " of the delegates had a
momentous influence on the cou‘
volition. A modern air was created
in the session by the presence of a
” feminine rosebnd." Cox and his
one adherent made an impression,
but Harding's man was the hit.
The convention atoued for its past
evils by preserving the ancient rc«
ﬁncmcnt of the Greek style of vot-
ing.

In the second scene we were ac-
quainted with the joys of a presi-
dential campaign. Even "Delia"
began to pity the harassed Hard~
ing. HoweverI the president's
problems are all solved when he ac-
cepts Mary O’Callahan as secre~
fury of state.

In the third scene President and‘
Mrs. Harding are enjoying their
vacation at Palm Beach. We feel
sure that the "solicitous wife ” will
prevent the President from too
strenuous appliance to either golf
or federal affairs. However, he has
a relapse upon hearing from the
paper that his caddie for the past
weeks was found out to be Cox,
who (in a crazy frenzy) had re-
sorted to cadtlying for his rival
candidate.

Inauguration Day was depicted
in the final scene. The band. the
cabinet. dignified as well as undig-
niﬁed friends. the old maid, and the
tease and even Delia were all there.
f‘ox. though mentally deranged.
did his share by selling "extras."
During the parade the wife of the
President. as beﬁtting one of her im-
portance, was drawn about by
coach and four. The judge so im-
ores=cd Harding that he not only
kissed the “Bible,” but read his
favorite passages. The inaugural
soecch was voted .1 great success.
but the. crowd could say with Hard-
ing. "Darned if i know, do you?"

The stunt made a decided hit.
