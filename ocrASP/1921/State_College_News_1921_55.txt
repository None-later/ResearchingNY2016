STUDENT ORGANIZATIONS

 

’1 MYSKANIA

 

One of the mast important steps
in the development of student
spirit and power was the organiza-
tion in March, 1917, of a student
council.

The purpOSe of the council islto
serve as a means of communication
between the students and the fac-
ulty. It is an honorary body, com
posed of not more than twelve nor
less than ten senior members who
have won places of prominence in
scholarship. athletics or other col-
lege activnies, and who have capac-
ity for leadership. Three of the
members are elected by secret ballot
in student assembly. This provi-
sion became effective for the first
time last year.

The president of the senior class
becomes a member ex-officio, if he
is not one before election to the
class presidency.

Some of the duties and privileges
of the student council are: To have
seats upon the platform at student
assemb ice; to govern inter-class
contests, other than athletic; to ad-
minister the rules governing the
various competitions for offices; to
administer the college customs; to
control fraternity and sorority prac-
tices; to call the freshman class
meeting for electing officers; to gov-
ern all class elections; and to make
recommendations to the student as-
sembly.

The 1921 members are: Katherine
Ball, Alida Ballagh, Reginald
Bruce, Theodore Cassavant. Mary
Grahn, Maurice Hathorn, Harriet
Holmes, Hugo Polt, Marjorie Pot-
ter, Florence E. Stanhro, William
Strain, Katherine Wan-sham, and
Mary Whish.

proved so successful that it has
been enthusiastically continued.
Chemical literature of every type,
serious or funny, is published, to
the extent of four or ﬁve times a
year in this aper.

The club itself holds its regular
meetings the second Friday after-
noon and the last Wednesday eve-

papers this year have been: “ Uses
of Waste,” “ The Concentration of
the Hydrogen Ion," “Artiﬁcial Fla-

are the informal ones held in the
spring and fall, the spring being the
time of the “Chem Club Picnic,"
and the fall, that of the big initia-
tion and dance.

At this initiation those people are
taken into the club Who are taking
