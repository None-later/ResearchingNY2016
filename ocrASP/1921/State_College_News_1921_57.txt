boarding place for State College
girls. This year. as last. the house
is situated at 747 Madison Avenue.

" e " Y“ bias eightevn members
and a house mother; it is a very
friendly. cheerful place where a
timid little freshman has no chance
to get lonesome. and even a digni—
fied senior is not bored to death.
The rooms are sunny. with splendid
accommodatious for studying, in
the way of tabl s book-eases. and
well placed lights. There is a large
parlor where all sorts of good times
are held. from informal house
dances to Christmas frolics or liri-
day night romps.

Now and then the “ Y " entertains
a distinguished guest. We were
very happy this year to have Dr.
Brubachcr to dinner with us. and
also at various times throughout the
year we enjoyed the company of

can Pierce. Professor Sayles, Dr.
Croasdale. and several other fac-
ultv members.

SOCIAL ACTIVITIES

 

Without a doubt, almost every-
one is interested in " good times,"
and State College has quite a few
during the year to relieve the
monotony of daily routine. The
freshmen are especially fortunate
because the faculty and upperclass-
men are so anxious to make the
newcomers feel at home that re-
ceptions are given to accnmplish
this purpose.

The ﬁrst reception is given by
the faculty. This may sound as
though it is a stiff. formal affair. but
such is not the case. Everyone
learns—the freshmen in particu-
lar—that the faculty are very hu-
man and cordial. and any conceived
dread of crustv profcsesnrs is
quickly dispelled, The following
week. for all festivities of this sort
are given on Friday evenings. the
V. . C. A. gives a iollv reception.
One would be pleased to know
how much time the V. W. girls
spend planning for this occasion—
planning novel ways and means to
get the students acquainted with
the newcomers. The seniors and
juniors do not wish to be left out
of all the fun. so each of these
classes give a reception. These rc~
ccptions are very informal and con-
sequently. very enjoyable.

But festivities do not end with
the above mentioned events. There

 

are others all through the (year.
Each class has a party or ance
during a given week.

The first is the Junior Week-end
which follows close after mid-year
examinations. The junior festivi-
ties are 0 encd on Thursday night
when u anqnet is held at the
Hampton Hotel for members of the
class only. This year the first ban-
quet was held and it is hoped that
the following classes will make it
the custom. Friday night the
Junior From. the big event of the
college year. is held in the ball-
room of the Ten Eyck llotel. The
closing event of the week is the
"Junior Night” at the varsity
basketball game. The “Jolly
Juniors ”——-every single one—enter
into these activities with the utmost
of jollity and high spirits.

Sophomore Week—end comes in
March. The festivities include a
soiree and a basketball game, liven
though their Soiree is not equal to
a Junior Prom. the sophomores
thoroughly enjoy it. for the frosh
cannot have as much. They do not
have a Week-end.

Senior Week comes in _lune. [t
is at this time that the, Senior
Class Day. Alumni Day. Bacca-
laureate Address and the Com-
mencement take place.

Tile sororities and fraternities
make merry during the year. Early
in the fall the sorority girls give
an lutcrsnrority Tea to which they
invite the faculty and students.
Soon after this rush parties. rc-
union week-ends, banquets. and a
formal lntersorority Ball are held.
The ball is held in the Ten Eyck
ilotel. This year it will occur
May 6.

Committee for lntersonity Ball:
Arrangements. Delta Omega; re-
freshments. Kappa Delta: decora-
tion, Gaunna Kappa Phi; music,
Alpha Epsilon Phi; taxi. Chi Sigma
Theta: invitations, Psi Gamma;
dance orders. Eta Phi.

The fraternities hold their an-
nual dances sometime during the
winter. Another event for the men
is the smoker given by the faculty
men. This is a very enjoyable “get-
.together" affair to promote fellow-
ship among the faculty and stu-
dents.

This is a brief resumé of State
College activities which help to de-
velop the, social side of college life.
Inasmuch as the majority of in-
formal social times are over at It
o’clock, the students’ work can in
no way stiffer.
