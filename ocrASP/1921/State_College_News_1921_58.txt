countng four points for every
semester hour in which he receives
credit with a grade of A, three
points for 13, two for C, and one
for i); and shall then divide the
total number of points tints secured
by the total number of semester
hours included in the calculation.
Only these candidates who attain
an average standing upon this basis
of at least 3.59 shall be designated
for honors.

“Announcement. The names of
all honor Students, in alphabetical
order, shall be printed upon the

Fearful Struggle

They were discussing the war.
“I suppose this is [the most fearful
struggle the world has ever seen."
said the traveling salesman.

“Oh, i don't know." replied the
)ostmatstcr. “I once saw two Jew

urglars trying to take money from
a Scotchman."

 

 

 

 

Moving-Up Day, 1920
(President llrubachcr)

MOVING—UP DAY

Moving-Up Day is our biggest
annual “All College" Day which
occurs sometime in May. The en-
tire day is given over to the
festivities.

First come the more formal
events in the chapel. Dr. Bru-
bachcr olliciates and our entire fac-
ulty are seated upon the platform.
At this time a representative from
each class speaks—sometimes
formally. sometimes otherwise.
Then occur the Moving-Up process
when each class takes the seats
formerly assigned to the preceding
one, the seniors taking those vacated
by the freshmen —— for they are new
and young in a world by them-
selves. During this impressive
ceremony the Moving~Up Day song
is sting.

Next in occurrenca is the pre-
sentng of pins to the new senior
“ News" editors in recognition of
their services. This will become
traditional. the ‘21 editors having
been the ﬁrst to receive these pins.

By far the most important event
is when the members of the new
l'iysltania are announced for the
lirst time. The old Mysltania, one
at a time, descend from their seats

 

ot' honor on the platform, march to
the place where the selected junior
sits announces the name; pins on
him the purple and gold ribbon, and
leads him to his position upon the
platform.

The seniors then lead the way to
the chapel steps, forming an aisle
through which the following
classes pass, each class as soon as
it passes through, forming the aisle
along the walk. The old and new
hfyskania then pass through the
aisle and lead the way to the platit-
ing of the ivy. A feature of last
year’s prog'am was the planting of
several ttrces upon the campus, Dr.
Richardson officiating in thc dedi-
cation ceremony.

Class stunts close the morning ac-
tivitics.

In the afternoon the college walk
to Ridgeﬁeld Park for the sports.
There is considerable rivalry in
these contests. and this assures a
truly exciting afternoon. The basc~
ball game closes these events.

in the evening all assemble on
the front steps of the college for
the biggest college. sing of the year.
Class song contests are a special
feature, a rizc being awarded the
winningr cass. Following this a
dance is held on the terrace.

From a Student’s Point of View

 

While the college lunch room is
maintained as a tielti for student

in the Home Economics Depart-

This is done by serving regularly,

the class in foods are from time to
time used as a supply to the menu,
llllls furnishing a practical outlet
for the class work. Combined with
this, are the ellicicnt services of

DRAM—EPICS—ANI; ART
ASSOCIATION

The Dranintics and Art Associa-
tion was founded in 1919 for the.
purpose of arousing a greater in—
tcrcst in tlranuitics anti the line arts
and of giving the students more
advantages in both these ﬁelds.

hc payment of the student tax
autotnatically nutkes each student a
member of the .t\ssnciation. Thlts
it includes practically the entire
student body and insures to every—
one an equal share in the benclit-s
derived. The Association is ﬁnanced
by an appropriation from the stu-
dent tax fund.

The control of the organization
rests with the Dramatics and Art
Council of nine members, three
faculty members and two studenlts
from each of the upper classes.
The council elects its own ofﬁcers
and transacts all the business of the
Association.

The events put forth by the
Dramatics and Art Association this
year have attracted lunch attention.
The big feature was John Drink-
water's lecture here on February 8.
The four one—act plays presented
just before mid—years were Of un-
usual interest. Iust a few weeks
ago Miss Futtcrcr read in the col-
lege auditorium “Quality Street,”
by James M. Barrie. Every one on-
joyed the traveling art exhibition
of copies of some of the paintings
by noted artists. The annual New
York trip was arranged to include
some of the best plays of the sea—
son. in addition places of interest
throughout the city were visited.
Preparation is now being,’ made for
the long play to be given in June.

Due to the fact: that so much of
the Association‘s fund has been
used for dramatic purposes, the art
side of the Association is planning
to save its energies until next year
when art will be emphasized.

 

 

Two men were discussing as to
What Noah did to pass away the
time on board the Ark. “i guess
he did a good deal of fishing," sug—

But someone is always ready
with a wet blanket. “He couldn't
do much ﬁshing with only two

 

,worms." was the retort.
