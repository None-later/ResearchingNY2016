THE CO-OP, OUR BOOK
STORE

State College is a live, wide-
awakc institution. but nothingabout
it is wide-awake or more progres-
sive than the new cooperative book
shop. However the Co-op is more
than a mere book store where we
pay to buy our histories, geometries
and latin dictionaries; it is the stu-
dent supply shop in their busy col-
lege life for everything, from push-

pius, crasers and stamps to station-
ery, memory book-s, pennants and
banners. The stock is continually
bein v enlarged until we sometimes
wont er into what sort of a depart-
ment store our little shop is going
to grow. The Co-op was started
last fall, more. or less as an experi-
ment, but within two weeks it had
so well proved its need and worth
that we knew that it had come to
stay, and now we wonder how we
ever got along without it through
all these years.

 

COLLEGE PUBLICATIONS

The publications which State Col-
lege boasts are three in number:
The " News,” the “Quarterly,” and
the “Pedagogue.”

The " News " is ublished weekly
throughout the col ege year and its
aims are to represent all of the
activities and interests of State.

The history of the “News” has
its beginning on Moving~up Day,
1916, when the Class of 1918 pre-
sented as its stunt an allegory,
the object of which was to show
the advantages of the introduction
into college life of a weekly news-
paper. This idea 'happily coincided
with a plan of Dr. Brubacher's, and
as a result the president of 1918,
Alfred E, Dedickc, was authorized
to publish a college weekly. The
ﬁrst issue of the " News " \vas pub~
lished October 4, 1916. With
autumn, 1917, came a great change,
when the ﬁnancial worries of the
paper were vanished with the ap—
pearance of the student tax.

be following constitution was
adopted by Myskania:

lege, devoted to the publication of

The “Quarterly” is State Col~
lege's literary publication. As is
suggested by the name, it comes
out four times during the college
year. Last lull this paper had a
hard tight for its life, but it came
out victorious. The "Quarterly"
is an addition to the college and
brings here many good exchanges
from other colleges.

The constitution for the "Quar-
terly" is based purely upon com-
petition and is as follows:

four times a year and devoted to
