FRESHMAN ADVISORS

One of the recent State College
institutions which deserves especial
praise is the freshman advisor sys-
tem. This is an arrangement by
which the youngest class in the
college is divided into small groups,
and a member of the faculty is as—
signed to each group as a special
guardian. This faculty member
acts as a big brother or sister, as
the case may be, and he carefully
considers the welfare of his group
and answers any question 'or
straightens out any difficulty which
ma arise in any branch of college
activity. The advantages of such
an arrangement can readily be seen.
The freshman is made to feel there
at home. He no longer feels like
an outcast, and he has someone on
whom he can depend in case of any
unforeseen trouble.

And the best part about the ad-
visor system is that it has worked.
It is not one of those beautiful
theories that don’t amount to any—
thing. in this year’s class there

is only one freshman who has not
made the acquaintance of his ad-
visor.

 

 

 

Sigma Nu Kappa Chapter House
SIGMA NU KAPPA

Sigma Nu Kappa is the oldest
fraternity in State College. Since
its founding in l9l3 it has been ac-
tive in promulgating college spirit
and good fellowship amongst the
men. The alumni of the fraternity
ntunber about 75. About two-thirds
are teaching in colleges and second-
ary schools throughout the United
States.

During the war practically every
meltlbcr joined the service, altd as a
result Sigma Nu Kappa was at low
ebb during that period. Soon after
the war, however, some of the old
members returned and with new
ones added, the fraternity again be-
gun to flourish. This year the ac-
tive members llll(lCl‘l00i( the con-

 

structiott of a fraternity house on
the college campus.

To Dr'. trttbacher the fraternity
is indebted for the gift of one of
the old military barracks, from
which ltllc members constructed the
first campus fraternity house. The
house is just what the men needed
as it furnishes not only dormitory
accommodations for several inch,
but also a line study hall and social
center. The new members taken in
recently are (iny llaskins, '23, John
(fassavant, ' 4, Alsten, ’24 and lier
lired Scott, '24.

A reception
alumni and new members at the
formal opening of the house. Plans
are now underway for a reception
to the faculty. but as yet no definite
date has been set.

 

ALUMNI ASSOCIATION

 

The Alumni Association of State
College has been very active this
year. lesidcs the general assoeia-
tion we now have four branch as—
sociations, the New York City,
Utica, Albany, and Western Asso-
ciations, the Western branch hav-
ing been organized this year.

The purpose of the Association
is to make some connection between
State College graduates and their
Alma Mater and to help the college
in any way that it can.

The Altnttni Association has
erected in the rotunda a memorial
tablet in llOllOl‘ of the State College
men who lost their lives in the
great war. They were able to do
this through the individual su‘b—
scriptions of the Alumni. This year
a very excellent “Alumni Quar-
terly " has been published which has
proved successful in every way. A
geographical file is now being made
of all State College Alumni, in
which they are classified according
to states and counties. This is in
addition to files according to classes
and alphabetically. Every State
College graduate should become a
member of the Association nearest
him and asubscriber to the “Alumni
Quarterly," which, besides contain~
ing many interesting articles. gives
much State College news and forms
a strong connection with college
students and alumni. From the
class of 1921, at least 100 names
should be added to the list of mem-
bers of the Association.

HOME ECONOMIES
DEPARTMENT

The Home Economics Depart—
ment was established at State Col-
lege in September, l91f). As first
given the course was completed in
one year. Since then it has been
expanded and improved, now cover-
ing four years and granting a
Bachelor of Science degree.

The course in clothing includes
plain sewing, dressmaking, textiles,
handiwork, millincry, costume de-
sign and history of costume, house
planning and decoration. These
subjects are closely correlated with
the art department.

The courses given in foods con-
sist of selection, preparation and
service of food, microbiology diet-
t-tics and nutrition. This work is
correlated with the science depart-
ment.

This year several new courses
have been given for sttIdcttls who
are not majoring in Home Eco-
nomics, and have proved very pop-
ular and successful.

The Practice House is operated
in connection with the department.
Here the senior students live for
two months, one month each semes-
tcr. They organize and conduct all
the household activities under the
supervision of one of the teachers

>(tf the department.

The college cafeteria is another
part of the Home Economics equip-
ment. It provides a practical outlet
for cookery class products and
gives practice in lunch room man-
agement. at the same time furnish—
ing good and economical meals for
college students.

The dressmaking shop on Central
Avenue is used as a laboratory for
the dressmaking and costume (le—
signing classes. it is well equipped
with foot and power machines. cut-
ting and work tables and a fitting
room. All types of work are (lone
for children and adults. from altera-
tion and reconstruction to the con-
struction of new garments.

About a fifteen—minute walk
across the park from college is the
H E. dormitory. Syddnm Hall,
housing (\VClliy‘fh’C girls. The
house is under the direct supervi-
sion of the department. one of the
facility livingr with the girls as house
mother. This dormitory was the
ﬁrst to be set up in connection with
college and has proved a decided
success.

Although the purpose of the dc-
partmcnt is to train teachers. it
places its graduates in many other
fields of work. Matty graduates
have been successful in laboratory
and hospital work. cafeteria and
lunch room management, and dc-
signing and dress-shop work.
