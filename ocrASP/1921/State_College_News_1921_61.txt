CLOTHING
DEMONSTRATION

A demonstration of clothing con~
struction for children was given in
the window of W. M. W‘hitncy &
Co, on Saturday, April 2, from 2 to
5 p. m. The aim was to show
simple and suitable clothing de-
signed to give style and satisfac-
tion and to save time, energy and
money in construction.

The demonstration was in two
parts. The cutting was done to
emphasize saving of material and
time“ "he second part included
principles of machine work and tin-
ishing. The dresses, aprons and
hats worn by the little girls were
made by the State College students
who (lid the demonstrating. The
students were members of the
clothing department. The children,
Betty Tcmpany, Ann Graft, Fred»
crick Graft, were brought from
Schenectady by Miss Ann Tem-
pany, of State College, to he the
models for the occasion. Both the
students and cildrcn did their parts
excellently, and made the window
demonstration a success.

The event at W. M. Whitney &
Co. was the culmination of an inter-
esting study of clothing design,
given under the direction of Miss
Grace 1’. Gillett, head of the home
economics department, and Miss
Anna Randolph Kcim, instructor.
At ﬁrst, a visit was made to the Al-
bany Orphan Asylum where, thru
the cooperation of Mr. Breeze, the
students met the children, and sc~
lectcd different types for which to
plan dresses. A trip to the Whit-
ney store, as a class group, gave the
opportunity to choose wisely the
materials and accessories for these
garments, which the store lur-
nished. At every step, the busy
mother and homemaker was con-
sidered, and in the construction
short cuts, without loss of wearing
satisfaction, were used. The gun
ments are to be given to the Al<
bany Orphan Asylum.

Such a plan as this is used to ad-
vantage by colleges and merchants
in large cities, that thru the co-
operation ol the merchant, the stu~
dents specializing in the clothing
subjects in home economics may
have a realization of the real prob-
lems of the homemaker. In their
specialiation, the hope is to make
clothing design and construction an
interesting and easier part of the
home duties. To get in touch with
the points involved, it is necessary
for the student to know and work
for real children, considering the at
trac‘tivc and practical type of gar-
ment. The senior students at
State College for Teachers were
given this opportunity thru the as~
sistancc of Mn Whitney and Mr.

rceze. The value of the use of
such educational principles was
satisfactorily demonstrated to the
public on Saturday.

COMMERCIAL
DEPARTMENT

To the young man or woman
looking forward to teaching as their
life work, the commercial depart-
ment in our college offers unusual
opportunities. Since its organiza~
tion about seven years ago, the de-
mand for its graduates has greatly
exceeded the supply. Secondary
school principals and superintend-
ents are constaitly asking for col-
lege trained commercial teachers,
with the result that many of the
most lucrative positions in the high
schools of the state are to be had
by teachers qualifying in this held
of education.

The course in Commercial Edu-
cation consists oi elementary and

advanced accounting, commercial
geography, commercial law, etc-
tnentary statistics, economics,

money and banking, slctiogritphy,
and type-writing. t’upils complet-
ing this course are able not only
to touch, but are qualiﬁed to hold
positions in commercial and secre-
tarial work in the business oliicc.
The courses in accounting are de-
signed to prepare for courses that
qualify for examinations in the held
of higher accountancy.

In addition to the regular college
work, ample opportunity is oliercd
for practical application of busi-
ness principles in the business oi-
ticc of the college and the Milne
High School. The work in the
busincs ollicc is most helpful, as
actual oilicc conditions and prob~
lems are met with and solved. in
the Milne High School, classes in
bookkeeping, typewriting, and stc-
nography afford the practice
teacher the necessary experience in
teaching commercial subjects,

ART DEPARTMENT

The Art Department of State
College has been very active dur-
ing the past year. its inﬂuence has
been felt about college in many
ways. One of the biggest things
which it has done for us this year
was to help bring the excellent art
exhibit here which everyone cri-
joyed so much a few weeks ago.
The trip to New York this year
took place at the beginning of the
spring vacation, when a study was
made of the Metropolitan Museum
of Art and many other places of
artistic interest.

The courses given in this depart—
merit include The History of
Ancient and Medieval Art and Art
Appreciation. These are open to all
students and form a valuable sup~
plement to any course. Classes are
given in design and representation,
and in the use of pencil sketching,
pen and ink, charcoal and water-
coloring. These classes have been
of the greatest bcnelit to the col—
lege, for dozens of posters have
been made for various happenings
in college and most of the ’eda-
gogue cuts have been made by art
students. The art department is
therefore considered one of vital
importance, not only to those
within it, but also to the entire col»
lege.

DRAMATICS AND A‘RT
ASSOCIATION

PRESENT DRAMATICS CLASS
MAY 26!}:

 

” One Thousand Years Ago "
To Be Played— Charming Chi-
ne5e Drama by Percy
MacKaye

 

Here is something more to look
forward to along with Moving-Up
Day and examinations. May 20
the Dramatics and Art Associa-
tion presents the Dramatics class
in “One Thousand Years Ago,”
by Percy Maclx’ayc. The play is a
charming story of ancient China—
“(lhina where all the world lies
a-drcam, and the place of our
dreams is eternal.” Under the able
direction of Miss Agnes Frittercr,
the cast has been chosen and re-
hcarsals are already well under
way. The role of Turaudottc, the
Chinese princess, will be taken by
Marjorie l‘ottcr and those who saw
her sympathetic interpretation of
the White Faced Girl in tllc " Will
0' the Wisp " will look forward to
seeing her work in the atmosphere
of China and dreams. The part
of her lover, Coly, Prince of As~
hrakan. will be taken by Margaret
Kirtland whose ability and force of
feeling in dramatic work is well
known to the student body. The
part of Cappocomico, :lcader oi the
band of italian players who wander
thru China. will he handled by
Miss Helen Leonard. Miss Leonard
is a newcomer to State College
dramatics but has had extensive ex-
perience in productions in Vassar
Tollcge. Her characterization of
Capoeomico is distinct and pleasing.
The remainder of the cast is as
follows:
