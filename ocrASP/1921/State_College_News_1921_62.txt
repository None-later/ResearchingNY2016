PENIN G GAME

 

TRIUMPHS OVER
ST. STEPHEN’S

 

,State opened the baseball season
yesterday by scoring an 8-7 win
over St. Stephen's. “Jack” John—
son pitched clleetive ball in spite
of the moist weather, and allowed
only ten scattered hits, while State
nicked Caldwell and Wolfe-rt for
eleven sale ones. Six times the
St. Stephen's lads whil'fed, when
Jack cut loose some real stttlf, and
eight times the valiant Sluggers for
State retired on strikes.

The game started between show-
crs with State in the lield. St.
Stephen squeezed one man across
the home plate in that llI‘Sl: inning.
After that both sides drew blanks
until the last of the fourth, when
McCluer singled to right, went to
second on a passed ball. and
crossed the plate for State’s tirst
tally on Dohris’ lhit. Dobris fol-
lowed over with the second and
alter a long struggle State let two
more die on hasu. St. Stephen's
came back with one, on it passed
ball. and State came back after
some more. 'l‘ed Cassavant reached
first safely, and landed on third
when Bliss slammed the hall for
two. McCluer came. up with horse-
shoes in his pocket, went to strike
at one, slipped, threw the hat at it,
and when “he nit-lee was over stood
on the second sack while Cassie
and Illiss counted one each. State
kept alter the pill until three more
had tallied, then gave way to St.
Stepln-n's. Nolhittg‘ loath the An-
nantlale lads gut next tn Jack and
the score read 7-4 when State came
in and scored her last one. in the
seventh St. Stephen‘s worked three
men across. while State was
blanked. In the eighth neither side
counted, but in their half of the
ninth, St. Stephen's flew the danger
signal witlh a man on second and
third and only one out. ,laek set-
tled down and struck out one big
boy. The next one popped up in
front of the plate and Nl't'ffluer and
Johnson ran together. The ball
drnpped. but Johnson dove for it,
made an impossible throw and
caught St. Stephen’s asleep at third,
and it was all over.
