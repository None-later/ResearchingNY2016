BASEBALL FANS—
ATTENTION!

 

State won her ﬁrst game Satur-
day. but the team’s pleasure at wm-
ning was considerably dampened,
not so much by the intermittent
showers as by the realization that
the visiting team had more loyal
fans with them than turned out for
State. We grant that the weather
was sufﬁciently uncertain to justify
grave doubts as to the probability
of the game being played, yet it
would scorn that it were no more
difficult or laborious for the fans to
turn out than it was for the players
to get into togs and brave the
weather. So what must the visiting
team have thought of the spirit at
State College? To the handful of
loyal fans who were at the game
we are grateful, for they saved us
the ignominy of having to announce
that State College was )laying.
Even so, the question is sti | sting-
ing in our cars, here are your
banners, your yells, your crazy mob
of fans, that are evidence indisput—
able of a real spirit of loyalty to
college and- the team?

MoO[.UER, 22.

Don't let the heading. ” baseball
fans," keep you from reading the
above editorial. :VVc think it's a
good one for all of us. especially
for us “ginls.” Do you think it's a
bit unfair or unjust that the boys
should ask us for our support?
"Of course not." you’ll say; and
that's just the point—you'll say
and never get beyond the saying,

Why is it that girls are such
enormoust big “talkers” and such
unbelievably small “doors”? We
stand around in attractive ging—
Inuned groups, and “collegiately”
express our desire for State College
to grow in size and magniﬁcence,
and then, just to show that we
know all about “ colleges and
things.” we throw in little asides
about the Doha and the D U’s.
Union (although we generally
choose one farther aWay—it's
safer) and the other colleges, as far
as we can remember their names.
Sometimes we vaguely wonder why
we grow so slowly, but we usually
give it up. It’s quite an unfathom-
able question.

In the .meantime, do you realize
what our men are doing? Usually
rushing to Beverwyck Park or the
Albany High gym, practicing hard
for two or three hours, not eating

Unromantic, perhaps, but good,
hard work, and deserving of our
loyal support. Did it ever occur to
you, oh, foolish virgins, that forty-
two men do more to make this a
real college than ﬁve hundred girls?

Athletics are having a struggle
at State College. Shall we let them
starve to death from lack of sup-
port—or lend them a hand and a
voice? The boys aren't ashamed
that they’re playing for a bunch of
girl rooters, so long as these girls
are sincere and loyal. Our aim at
all times is the same—the glory of
State College. Girls, show your-
selves to be good sports. and he
