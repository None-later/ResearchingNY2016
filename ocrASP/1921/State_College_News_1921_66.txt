WELCOME

strange place where there is no one
to welcome you? State (Jollch

dred extend to you the heartiest
kind of a hearty Welcome, and

leges in the world, and not only that
--it's ours. We want to make it
yours also. but we can do that only
when you come half way. Do your
share and we'll try to do our best to
make you very happy and welcome
in our .-\lnia Mater.

The most effective way to make
people feel that college is of vital
interest to all is throuin Stlltlenl
sell-expression and suggestions.
The way that you can all express
your opinions as to State's faults
and good points is through the
columns of our "News." which is
always more lliaii glad to publish
the things which you most want to
get over to your fellow students.

want to tell you how happy they.
especially. are to have you at
