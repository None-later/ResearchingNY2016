DEAN OF WOMEN

Broadly speaking, the general
welfare of the women students is
the task assigned to the Dean of
Women.

meat. To this group add four
hundred or more other young
women who have advanced to the
upper t: tsses but still have proli~
leins which they bring to the otliee
of the Dean «ii Women. and no im—
agination is needed to see that the
task is thus increased.

The adjustments to be made by
the freshman might be roiiuhlr
grouped under two heads; first.
those of livingr conditions which
hitherto have been determined by
her patents: second. those of work-
ing conditions which have largely
been directed by llt‘l' trarlters.

OU R PUBLICATIONS

 

First Summer " News "
Now that you have elaneed
through the first ' . of the
“State College News" that has
ewr ’ltt'l'll published in the summer
session, perhaps you would like to

    

5‘

know something of the paper‘s
lii~lory.
l‘lie “ News" is published

weekly throughout the t'tillt'er year.

 

and it aims are to represent all of
the activiti s and interests of
State.

The t‘Ullt‘jJC weekly had its he—
gltlttihp‘ on Moving—Lip flay, lf’lti.
when the class of lOlh’ pi'esrntml as
its stunt an allegory. the olijeet of
whirli was to show the :tdraiitaees
of the introduction into college life
of a weekly newspaper. This idea
happily coincided with a plan of
Dr. liruliacher's, and as a result
the president of lDlB, Alfred E.
Dedicke. was authorized to publish
a college paper. The first issue oi
the" News " was published October
4, lﬂlﬁ. With antnitin, 19l7, came
a e'r 'it change, \vllvii the financial
worries of the paper were vanished
with the appearance of the student
tax. its roustitutiou, which was
adopted by .\lyskaiiia, provides for
an editor—invchief, a managing edi-
tor. a business manager, a sub-
scription manager, two assistant
business manage s associate edi—
tors, and reportms.

The “Quarterly” is State Cob
lee'c's literary puhliration. :\s is
suggested by the name, it routes
out four times during the college
year and is a valuable asset both
because of its contents and because
of the good exchanges brought here
front other colleges.

About Moving-Up Day everyone
looks forward to the publication of

 

 

 

 

history. the student artivities of the
whole college for the current year.
humorous or satirical expressions
of college life. and lots of jokes on
college people. _

There is still another puhlicatimt
which belongs to State, hut which
is not published by students who
are here now. it is the “Alumni
Quarterly,” and is published by the
