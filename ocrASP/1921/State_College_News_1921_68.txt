STUDY WE MUST

 

l'lcasant as it is to study about
the campus, it is equally enjoyable
to do reference work in our college
library which is well equipped. We
are sure you will tind everything
convenient and comfortable. In
order that you may get that history
assignment prepared the library
will be open from nine until live
each day.

The Pine Hills library on Ontario
street, the Y4 M. A. library in the
Harmanus~Blcccker building on
Washington avenue near Lark
street, and the State Education
building are nearby and may be of
some help to you. Spend one of
those rainy afternoons—perhaps
there will be a few this summer—
cxplnring not only in the libraries
at the “ Ed.” building but also in
the museum.
