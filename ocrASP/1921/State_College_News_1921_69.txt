IMMIGRANT EDUCATION

Interesting Plans for the Course

 

The, University of the State of
New York in co-operation with the
State College for Teachers is giv-
ing four courses: at the State Col—
lege in immigrant; education. The
aim of these courses is to prepare
the student for teaching the for-
eign-born and for supervising
classes taught by others. These
ciaSscs are held daily in Room 250
at ll o’cloc .

Dr. Joseph De Porte is giving a
very interesting course in Immi-
grant Backgrounds. The cultural
value of this course is very great
and the atmosphere which Dr. Dc
Forte is able to bring to the course
makes it well worth while.
