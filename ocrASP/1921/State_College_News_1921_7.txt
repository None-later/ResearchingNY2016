WHEREIN OUR
WONDER CEASETH

 

Much as we hate to appear
boastful, we surely have to be
proud of the evidence of State
College spirit shown in student as—
seiiibly last Friday morning. Gone
now are the visions of a “Morris
chaired” chapel—and they were re-
linquishcd without a sigh, For
when it comes to a tinal decision
State College stands pat for every-
thing that’s right, for all that’s
courteous, for all that's fair and
square, and for ideals worthy of
State College. Nor is it a sancti-
nionious attitude~its enthusiasm
and pop, without rowdyism, but
with loyalty and devotion to our
Alma Mater, and kindlincss and fair,
play to all. Thus is State College
spirit—«much talked of, often seen
of unlimited quantity, and everlast-
ing quality.

 

MORE CHAPEL

 

How good it seemed to have
everyone vote in favor of the mo-
tion that was brought up in as-
sembly two weeks ago—namely,
that no one should bring.r hooks,
lunches. etc. to chapel. But how
much better it seemed to have this
vision realized. No one forgot, but
everyone came empty bonded. with
nothing,' to do 'but give his best
attention to what was going on.

“Io imagine everyone was glad
too that he had nothing else to do,
since we had such a line speaker to
whom we could listen. Undoubt-
edly he appreciated the interest and
attention which he received from
the student body as a whole. But
probably he would have appreciated
it far more if he had spoken here
several weeks ago and had had
occasion to come back again last
week. He could not have helped
but notice the marked difference.

It's crtainly true that the stu-
dent body should be praised for
standing back of such a movement.
But then doesn't it always do what
it starts out to accomplish?

 

’SPECIALLY
SOPHOMORES

Does '23, luck pep? Sophomores,
you are the ones to determine that
it docs not. Let's do it.

Repeatedly during the term some
Juniors and Freshmen have come
to me to say emphatically that the
Sophomore class hicks spirit. They
try to Have their statement by
saying tliat even some Sophomore
or Senior will acknowledge the fact.

When a Sophomore or a member
of our sister class says anything
about our spirit, they do not say
this to discredit us. i they say
we need more class spirit, they
mean to arouse us to possvss more
than in: already have. There arc
unbounded limits to the amount
one can have, and these people
have so much themselves that they
believe everyone should have as
much.

Sophomores, it is up to you to
show the good that is in you. Let
your class spirit shine so that oth-
ers may SL‘L! it. Let's attend every
class lllL‘t‘lllLL', conic and cheer at
the basketball games, come to all
the cvllcgc activities, and lastly cii<
force the lircslinnui rulcs.

 

THE POST-EXAM.
JUBILEE

At this timc of the year we
have a sickening sensation within
us that donutcs that mid~ycars are
approaching pell—meli. in two
wot-k5 time those tcrriblc exams
will be passed or Ilunkcd. and each
and every one of us will be pos-
sensor] with an insane frenzy to
cclcbratc.

(illlm‘ years we have been coni-
pcilcd to find an outlet for our
“vivacious spirits" by going to
the "Hall" or by “eating.” in
either case we were usually dis-
satislicd or uncomfortable for some
time. However, this year we are
going to have the opportunity to
have a real jubiloc, and every stu—
dent in State Cullch may celebrate
with every other student in State.

The expenses of tliejubilcc are to
be divided among the classes. and
it is not expected that the affair
will result in the bankruptcy of any
class. Myslranin has also appointed
committees from the classes: The
Freshmen have barge of rcfrcsh~
incnts, tlic Sophs havt- charge of
decorations, the Juniors have
charge of the music, and the
Seniors have Charge. of door and
entertainment. Each class is to
prescnt a stunt, and these stunts
are to be the best that have ever
been concocted within tlic heads of
college students, and each class is
to vie with the other classes in
putting on the winning stunt. l’tir~
therinorc. the whole affair is to be
conducted as a carnival, and we
all will be covered with confetti for
once in our lives. An added at-
traction its the probability of a
great deal of " noise."

This jubilee is an experiment as
far as State ollcgc is concerned,
but Post-Exam festivities are held
in many other institutions. We all
feel sure that February 2nd is
going to be such a success that
it will be a precedent for annual
jubilccs. Let us all join in making
it popular of Moving Up Day.
No outsiders are invited. They
could not appreciate the hilarity of
the occasion, but let all students be
present and prepared to show in a
material way the joy which takes
possession of one‘s soul at such
a time.

 

To the Editor of thc State College

"Slows," State College, Albany,
Dear Sir;

At present there are seven sor«
critics and three l'atcrnitics at
State College. The total member—
ship of the seven sororities is about
150, and the fraternity iiicmberslup
at present is approximately

Each week these 185 people or
rather llic groups to which they
belong arc usurpitig space in thc
"Nuivs" for personals. The ques-
tions that i should like to ask these
fraternal groups on this subject are
as follows:

l. is it of llllUl't'Sl to the college
at large that some one group has
had Sunday callers, that another
group has had an informal birthday
party for one of its Iiicuihcrs, or
that scvcral of the members of a
group Sllt'lll lllL! week end at their
rcspcctivt- hrniics?

2. is any of the material cited of
particular interest to even one of
the scvcrai crillcgcs with whom, I
am on to understand. we ex-
change ' v'” regularly?

3. is it i r to thc neutrals who
by far t‘olilpuﬁn the larger part of
thc student body?

a particular group has rlonc
sonicthing iiilcrcsting' or worth
while lrt us rcnd about it in thc
“News.” if new members are
pledged, a honsc party is licld, or
individuals of a particular group
have done solitclliing rucriinriuus,
h-t us read about that too under the
sorority and fraternity uotrs, But
~if we han group personals let us
run them as such nndcr College
pci‘snuals and in? dour: with it.

Appreciating the lact that the
Sororities and fraternities are 0
vital importance in tlic lilc of a
college and that State is first in
lllL'll' interests, would it not be a
good plan to have the Sentiments
of these groups on this subject cx-
prcsscd through tllt‘ “Ncws”?

Yours for ” Statc College,"

A Sorority Senior.

IDEALS

 

is tlicrc anyone who has not at
least one ideal in which he believes
heartily and for which he strives?
{\nd it is necessary to strive. for
it] the pursuit of ideals one must
lacc often the criticism and ridicule
of those whosc sight is blinded to
the finer things. However, if the
standard is wnrtli while, and if one
has tlic powcr of his conviction,
he will advance toward the goal
and pcrhnps gain it wliun the op-
pmicuts are just beginning to rcal~
l7.(‘ what a good thint,r it is after all.

\Vc may have many ideals, and
we may change them as We develop
in character. in» an interestinn
discussion the other day, it was
pointed out that the possession of
ideals is one of the factors in per—
souahty. it would seem that col-
lege life contributes the means to
acquire almost all of the elements
that go to make up personality, and
not least among those are the ideals.
May we .scizc upon the opportunity.
choose ltlculs worthy of us and
work for them.

 

LIEUT. WIERZBICKI
SPEAKS T0 STUDENT
ASSEMBLY

 

in Friday morning assembly we
had the opportunity of liearinp,r
about conditions in France from
one who had come directly from
that country. Dr. Brubachcr in-

troduced the French High Com-

 

missioner, Lieutenant Vincent Wi—
ci'zbicki, who explained in a very
forceful mauucr why France has
always been able to carry on her
reconstruction so easily. The
president and other members of tho
Alliance tt‘rancaisc of Albany were
guests upon the platform.

Lieutenant Wicrzbicki cited cx-
amplcs from French history show--
ing France a Country of "ups and
downs." After a great fall it rc~
gained power and built tip spur-(lily.
Attcr the hundred y tars wnr lirancu
was saved by the power of Ullt',
u'onian, Joan of Arc, of whom \vc
all know the story. She :lccotn-
plisiiL-(I what it took two men to do
at u later date. in 1870, after the
l’i'ziiicn-t’riissiaii war, when l-‘rancc
lost llcr two dcnrly ltivcd provinces
of Lorraine and A 3 cc, siic l'ccuv—
cred midcr the direction of thc
ablcst of lircnch kings, Louis XIV
and his minister, Sully. Again in
1921), France is carrying on a mnr~
vclons rccoustruction pcriod. The
year l9l9 was one to Sec the
preparation for this new pcriud for
at this time factories \Vcrc bulb and
minus \vcrc rccovcrcd.

liy bcinpr shown thcsu hit'
ifl‘L‘llCll history, we were inipr s:
with the spirit of the French ]lt‘tl[|lt‘
against their loin,r lasting cut-my,
with whom thcy had to struggle
from the time the lluiis Wt‘l't‘ roe
pulled by Attila in their invasion of
Europe.

  

France was able to carry on her
reconstruction so efficiently at
flu-sc- various times for four rea-
sons. First’, it was their love for
lllt‘ soil. Although the soil was
cxhaustcd through many years of
work, it continued to yield products
because of thc unrestrained efforts
of the people. Secondly, it was be-
causc lirancc was a country of
meat \VUI‘h’CI‘S. We were told that
thc children of France carried on
much of the works in the ﬁelds and
in the stable. Children scvcn,
clcvcn, and fmirtccn continued the
work which their father, disabled
from war, left for them to do.
Then because France is so small.
being equal in size to our Statc of
l‘lcxas, it still remains a unit. The
diverse climates make possible a
large range of products. Lastly,
eiiipliasrs was laid upon the great
men in France in contrast to the
gay and frivolous. We mistake the
breach people when we put stress
upon the society of the Capital
City. France, indeed, is a country
of hard workers—not mcrcly a
busy people in the American sense.
The French hclicvc in intensified
work and pleasures along:r with it.

 

 

CHEMISTRY CLUB

7. At the last meeting of the
Llicniistry Club on Friday after-
noon Margaret 8th and John Mac-
Grcgor prcscitlcd papers on “The
Concentration of the Hydrogen
inn" and “'Artilicial Flavoriiigs”
respectively.

At the curl of the meeting John
MacGrcgor and Joseph Zcpf were
blindfolded with towels. hclnieted
with scrap baskets, and armed with
rolled newspapers. The two com-
batants were then twirlcd until
their sense of direction was lost
before being sent at each other in
deadly battle. More injury, how-
ever, was done to the onlookers
through uncontrollable laughter
than to the warriors themselves.
