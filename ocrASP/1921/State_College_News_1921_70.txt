A PROFESSION

On the first few days at summer
school it has been impressed upon
us more than ever before that
teaching is really a profession.
Those who realized it before now
appreciate it more fully, and those
who (lid not consider it so before
are—,—many at least—beginning to
awaken to that fact. When We see
large munbers who are teachers or
prospective teachers combining
their efforts to find better methods
of helping pupils, to solve problems
of importance, to increase their per-
sonal knowledge for the benefit of
the younger generations can we
help seeing that teaching truly is
a profession?

Just as doctors study new de-
vices for working miracles on the
lmman body, so teachers seek new
devices that effect the human mind.
Just as physicians study that they
may diagnose cases correctly, so
teachers attempt to diagnose the
psychological conditions of pupils,

in all of the professions we find
the most capable and able people,
and this is no less true in the pro-
fessinn of teaching—at least it
should not be.

if there is strength in numbers
the profession which State repre-
sents should indeed be very strong.

PATRONIZE THE
ADVERTISERS

If you have looked through your
"Ne vs” carefully, you have un-
doubtedly seen several columns de-
voted to advertising. The willing-
ness of these business houses to
advertise in our paper has made it
possible for us to have such a
"News" which has probably been a
help to you in your ﬁrst days at
State.

if you are a stranger in Albany
and don't know where to go for the
articles you want to buy. why not
give these places a trial? They
'may have exactly the things you
want. When you go to them, tell
them you saw their advertisements
in the State College News, It will
please them and help us at the same
time.

MOVING-UP "DAY
Choosing ofmgrania Special
Event

 

Moving-up Day which occurs
sometime in May is our biggest
annual "All College“ day. The cu~
tire day is given over to the festivi-
ties.

First come the more formal
events in the chapel. l)r. l'iru-
bachcr ofﬁciates and our entire
facility are seated on the platform,
At this time a representative from
each class speaks-«sometimes
formally, sometimes otherwise.
Then occurs the Moving~Up proc-
ess when each class takes the seats
formerly assigned to the preceding
one, the seniors taking those va-
cated by the frcslnncn——~—for the
"grand old seniors" are new and
young in a world by themselves.
During this impressive ceremony
the Moving-Up Day song is sung.

Next in occurrence is the pres-
entation of pins to the new senior
“News” editors in recognition of
their services. This will become
traditional, the 'Zl editors having
been the first to receive these pins.

By far the most important event
is the announcement for the first
time of the new Myslcania. Each
member of the old Myskania, one at
a time, descends from his seat of
honor on the platform. marches to
the place where the selected junior
sits, announces the name. pins on
him the purple and gold ribbon, and
leads him to his position on the
platform.

The organization of this council
in March. 19l7, was one of the most
important steps in the development
of student spirit and power.

The purpose of Myskanin is to
serve as a means of communication
between the students and the Fac—
ulty. lt is an honorary body, com-
posed of not more than twelve nor
less than ten senior members who
have won places of prominence in
scholarship. athletics or other col-
lege activities, and who have capac-
ity for leadership. Two of the
members are elected by secret bal-
lot in student assembly.

The president of the senior class
becomes a member ex-oﬂicio if he
is not one before election to the
class presidency.

After the council is chosen the.

seniors lead the way to the chapel
steps, forming an aisle through
which the other classes pass, each
in their turn lengthening the aisle
along the walk. The old and new
Myskania then pass through the
aisle and lead the line to the plant-
ing of the ivy. A feature of last
year’s program was the planting of
seven oak trees on the campus as
a memorial to the State College
students who gave their lives in the
Great War. Dr, Richardson offici-
ated at the dedication ceremony.

Class stunts close the morning
activities.

in the afternoon the college
marches by classes to Ridgeﬁeld

' Park for the sports. There is con- V
siderable rivalry in these contests '

and this assures a truly excitian
afternoon. The baseball game
closes these events.

in the evening all assemble on the
front steps of the College for the
biggest College sting of the year.
Class song contests promote much
interest since a prize is awarded the

 

winning class. Following this danc-
ing is held on the terrace. Thus
ends one of the busiest, most excit-
in_ and happy days of the year.
Tf‘lc settlers aml juniors return
home in a 'ather serious frame of
mind for newly acquired dignity is
upon them, while the sophomores
and freshmen are conscious of a
very friendly feeling between them
since rivalry is over, and peace is
to prevail henceforth.

OPPORTUNITIES FOR
SWIMMING

 

Parties Arranged

it will be of interest to summer
students to know that there is an
excellent swimming pool at the
public bath, on the corner of Cen-
tral Avenue and Ontario Street.
The baths are open to women on
'i‘uesday afternoon, Thursday
morning and Friday afternoon,
Men's hours are on Monday after-
noon, Wednesday afternoon and
Saturday afternoon.

'i‘hroughout the Session swim-
ming parties for women will be ar-
ranged. in fact the first one is
already planned. All tllDSc desiring
to have a good time at the pool
meet at three o'clock 'l,‘ucsday at
the Cwop. Suits are supplied if
you didn’t bring yours with you to
Albany. (lips may be purchased
at the Co-op.

Notices of other parties will be
posted later.

 

PASS THE WORD ALONG

You Need a Ticket

if you have been so neglcetfnl
as not to have bought your sum-
mer association ticket, don’t fail to
do so at once. if there isn't a table
in the rotunda ask somebody about
them. You will be able to find
some one of the college students
without a doubt. After the fine
time you had Friday night you
shouldn’t hesitate very long. Next
Friday night has better things yet
in store for you, but this week you
can’t get in without a ticket or .15
cents. Don’t you think a ticket is
better than paying at the door?

Miss Agnes E. Futterer

TO READ
“QUALITY STREET”

Reading Followed by Step Sing

On Friday evening in the audi-
torium James liarrie’s "Quality
Street" will he read by Miss Agnes
E. liutterer, instructor in Oral ling-
lish and Dramatics.

Miss iiiitterer is a g'aduate of
State College, and after doing
graduate work at Columbia Uni-
versity and at the American Acad-
emy of Dramatic Arts. she became
a member of the College Faculty.
She has been especially active in
connection with the Students’ Dra~
maiie and Fine Arts Association,
which among other activities, pre-
sents three one-act plays the first
semester and one long play, second
semester.

Miss Futtercr’s ability as a read-
or has always been gr-atly apprc~
ciated by the student body. "Qual—
ity Street" is a whimsical comedy
that has about it all the fragrance
of an old-fashioned English garden.
It carries one far away from this
work-a-day.world, yel- succeerls in
keeping its readers close In its
people that have the appeal of r ral-
ism softened by the gentle charm
that is Barric's. This is a type of
play that Miss linttcrcr docs excep-
tionally well, perhaps it is because
her voice has in it the same sort of
charm that liarric‘s plays have. or
perhaps it is because she is so
natural, so unaffected, in all her
work. No one should need to be
urged to attend the first reading on
Friday evening at 8 o’clock.

 

At the conclusion of the reading
everyone will be invited to take
part in an activity which is exceed-
ineg popular throughout the year
here at College—a step sing. You
will have a fine time this evening
at the Community Chorus—on Fri-
day there is offered a similar pleas-
ure with the additional attraction
of its taking place onl-nf—doors on
the steps,

Whatever time remains will be
given over to dancing on the
plaza—much after the custom of
Moving-Up night.

The committee in charge of the
Friday evening programs, consist-
ing of students of the senior class;
is as follows: Margaret Meyer.
chairman; Robina Moore-Smith,
Sylvia l'otter. (‘arnl ’l“aver, Marion
Brennan, Margaret Smith and
Katherine Merchant.

Elizabeth Carey, ’22, has charge of
the music. and refreshments will be
taken care of by Queene ffmnan,
'23; Ethel lluntcr, ’22; Pauline
linker, ’22; Jack Johnson, ’23; Mary
ifayes, ’22, and Winifred Dunn. '22.
