OUR DEAN

(Tune. "Siniles")
'L‘here are Deans in every college,
Every one throughout the land”
There are Deans who overﬂow wtth

knowledge

Which they always have at their
command.

'l‘here are Deans with nasty dispo-
sitions.

There are Deans with foolish
thoughts and ways,
ltut the Dean who's everything he

should he

Is Dean Iloriiet‘ of S. (,1, T.

Here's a song that we sing to
Dean llorner during the regular
College session. We usually sing
it at haskethall games which he
very often attends and at which he
shows an interest in our sports.
What do you think of the sugges-
tion that we sing it to him this:
summer?
