ATHLETIC REVIEW
1920-1921

it can never be said that State
Co'leae lacks spirit when it comes
to athletics, The real State spirit
is shown both by the men on the
teams and by the hundreds oi
rnuters \\‘llO cheer their teams to
victory if possible, or, if the game
goes wrong, cheer anyway. State
("allege students are always loyal
to the lentils that are building up
the reputation of their Alma .\later.

This loyalty has been rewarded
during the past year, for in every
branch of sport the men wearing
the Purple and Gold commanded
respect.
Basketball.

lasketball has always been the
major sport at State. The 1920-
lillll season has been one of the
most successful in the history of
the college. There were many dif-
tieulties to overcome. but they were
overcome and the result was the
struuuesl team that has ever rep-

See The Famous Indian Ladder

The bike to Indian Ladder is
He most popular annual hike at
State College. This year we want
to introduce this beautiful place to
our Summer Students.

We go by bus to the end of the
state road and then hike across the
country roads to the foot of the
mountains where a wonderful
camp site will be spread out before
us. The clifT—like mountain sides
have hnue cavities with sandy floors
at their bases. The place is guaran-
teed rain-proft’ and cool under all
conditions.

The spot derives its name from
the fact that the ascent is so steep
that in places the Indians used to
use fallen tree trunks for ladders
on parts of their trails over the
summit. Tradition has it that this
was a favorite camping ground

 

uith the lndians, relics of whose
stay may still be found. lirom
here the Aboriginies watched fer
an opportunity to add a Dutch
scalp or two to their collection.

After a little rest we will take
the trail to the top of the Holder-
bergs from which a wonderful view
can be enjoyed. Albany, Schenec-
tady, and even Troy on a clear day
can be seen nestled in the Hudson
and Mohawk valleys, surrounded by
the fertile farms once tilled by the
workan of the Patroous.

A small cascade of pure, cold
water dashes over the trails, add-
ing: materially to the attractiveness
of this natural park which the State
has set aside as a reservation so
that all may enjOy its unlimited
beauty.

MISS FUTTERER’S
READING

Mary Whish, '21, Soloist

   

it is absolutely mince sary to
speak of Miss Futtcrcr's ability as
a : ler to all those who heard her
read “Quality Street ” last Friday
evening. They all join in saying
that she has added another success
to her loin,r list of achievements in
dramatic reading. This Friday
evening at 8:30 o‘clock Miss lint-
lert-r will read Tennyson's “Elmch
Arden." To those who were not
with us last week, a word—there
are no classes Saturday. and com-
mutters can just as well arrange to
be here as not. Ask those who
came, and they will say that they
wouldn't miss a single one here-
after.

lit-lore the reading vocal solos
will be given by Miss Mary Whish
of Albany. Miss Whish is a State
('nlleee alumna. having been gradu-
ated in June 192]. She has always
delighted the student body with
her clear soprano voice when she
took part in stunts and programs.
It will be a treat for you to hear
her on Friday. "

The rest of the evening will be
given over to campus dancing.

 

COMMUNITY CHORUS

The second step toward making
this a singing;r summer session will
be made tonight. The attendance
at the [irst Community Chorus was
excellent but a spirit of titnidity
characterized the singing. You
may not be an opera star but don't
let that keep you from joining in.
College singing is one of the big
things that bind students together
and makes for that elusive feeling
known as College Spirit.

Mr, Ernest Hesser is the soloist
tonight. He is director of music
in the city schools of Albany and
soloist in the First Presbyterian
Church. Community songbooks
will be availabe. Do not miSs this
splendid opportunity of getting to—
gether. Be at the Auditorium.at
8:30 tonight.
