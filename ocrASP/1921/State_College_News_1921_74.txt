ovations

This week there are found in
the paper articles concerning ath—
lelies. llul there- are other games
than these purely physical ones.
Deﬁning work from the standpoint
of one's mental attitude toward it,
we may say that occupation which
is irksoine is work while that which
is pleasant is play. It is to be de—
sired that all of us who are pre-
paring for or are already engaged
in lhe teaching profession look up-
on it as the finest one in the world.
Yet there are teachers who have
been known to discredit their oc-
eiipatiou to people about to enter
it. Whatever is the cause of their
(1' itisfaetion, might it not be that
these teachers have not been caught
in the .tide of enthusiasm and de-
light of helping others that makes
leaching a pleasure. The spirit of
all who have gathered here this
summer can not be questioned.
Each is seeking to renew his
strength, to keep theienergy and
skill in his game. l.’erehanee we
have adopted this as our motto~
‘f l'la up! Play upl and—~Play
the game i "
