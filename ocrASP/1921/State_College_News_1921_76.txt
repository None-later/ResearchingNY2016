ATHLETIC REVIEW
Continued from Page 1
resented State College. The team
work was so good that even before
the season opened the team made a
very favorable impression in ath—
letic circles. When the season
opened the quintet lived tip to its
reputation. [n the ﬁrst game our
men met St. Michael's College
team and defeated them most dc-
eisively. Then there was the Union
game which will be remembeer as
one of the fastest and most thril-
ling games played in the Union
College gymnasium. As the sea-
sou went on the team continued
to show good form and turned in
decisive victories over Manhattan,
St. Stephen's, Pratt, and Clarkson
chk. The Purple and Gold also
played Colgate and St. Lawrence
Universities and allho defeated
made the .victors work hard for
their victories. The latter game
had to be decided by an extra ﬁvé
minute period. Great praise is due
to Coach Suavcly for his splendid
training and instruction, to Captain
Hathorn for his ﬁne leaders-hip,
and 10 Manager Bliss for his ei’ﬁe—V
icnt handling of the business mat-

tors.
The prospects for next year are
very bright. There will probably

 

be three of last year’s letter men
on the squad.
a nucleus the Coach hopes to form
a strong team. A tentative seheth
ule including St. Michael's, Clark—
Hon, Union, Colgate. St. Stephen’s,
Norwich. Pratt, University of Ver-
mont, Middlebury, and possibly
Williams, Trinity. Dartmouth, and
West Point has been made.
Hockey.

The lnildncss oi the winter forced
Slate to cancel all but one game
of a heavy schedule including such
colleges as I‘Iamillon, Union and
Ix'cnssalaer Polytechnic institute.

.It is hoped that next seson the
weather will he more favorable as
several lettcrmen will he in college.
A strong team is assured.

_ Track.

Track was somewhat neglected
during lhcvpast year because of lack
of sullicient material. The annual
cross country run was staged on
(Tunlpus Day. Neuner ’21 was an
easy winner. Several track events
for men were staged Movint,r Up
Day. The Seniors captured Iirst
honors in this meet. ‘

Tennis.

With the coming of sprng all
State College begins to think of
tennis. A college tournament for
men is held. From the men mak-
ing the best showing in this tourna-

ment a varsity team to represent.'

lhc Purple and Gold is chosen.
The big event of last season was the
annual intercollegiate tournament
with St. Stephen‘s College of An-
nandale. A large crowd saw the
representatives of State take every
match both in the singles and in
the doubles. This was the second
consecutive time that this has been
done.

The Purple and Gold is lucky in
this sport also. Next year three
of last years team will return to
college. With such a strong ad-
vantage as this it is likely that a
more extensive schedule will be
carried‘ out. ‘

SEE THE INDIAN LADDER
Continued from Page 1.

Thompson's Lake, one of New
York's many mountain jewels, is
only one and a half miles from the
Ladder. The W. Camp and
Camp Pinacle are nearby. Numer-
ous sanitariums and cottages are
scattered'ovcrdhe hills. On the
trip we will see the pretty little
villages of Delmar, Slingcrlands,
and Altamont. v

Each person will bring the food
necessary for his or her comfort.
The expense of the bus will de-
pend on the number who go, and
will probably be between ﬁfty cents
and a dollar. Get your tickets this
week in the rotunda.
