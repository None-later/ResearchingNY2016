LECTURE

book heroes and proud youths who
chop down cherry trees and gain
fame by confessing to it later you
will agree with Mr. Dooley when he
says, “History is a post-mortem ex-
amination. It tells us what men
died oi. I want to know what men
lived of." Come to the auditorium
at 12 o’clock. Thursday, and hear
Professor Risley's lecture on "What
Men Lived Of."

THE HUDSON RIVER
EXCURSION.

Each summer at State there are
a great number of hikes. excursions
and trips, but there is one excnsion
that beats them all. That is the all
day sail to Kingston Point and re-
turn.

The excursion this summer will
be held Saturday, August 6. This
trip is one of the most popular out-
ings that a person can take. Each
season thousands of tourists use the
Hudson River Day Line in order to
see the Hudson by daylight. Can
you imagine anything more pleas~
ing than to sit back comfortably in
a deck chair on a swiftly moving
steamer with nothing to do but iuv
hale the fresh breezes and enjoy the
scenery of the "American Rhine?"

Of course you can't. So remember
the date, August 6. The fare will be
very small in comparison to the
value of the trip. It will be your
last chance this summer to get to-
gether. In a few days tickets will
he on sale. Save yourselves a life—

time of regret by buying one and
get ready to come with us August 6.

 

 

Dr. G. M. Conwell

TO TALK ON EINSTEIN
THEORY

 

“A mail in a faded gra raincoat
and a flopping felt hat ttat nearly
concealed the gray hair that strag-
glcd over his ears stood on the boat
dock of the steamship Rotterdam
yesterday. timidly facing a battery
of camera men. in one hand he
clutched a shiny hrier pipe and the
other clung to a precious violin. He
looked like an artist—a musician.
He was. .

But beneath his shaggy locks was
a scientific mind whose deductions
have staggered the ablest intcllccts
ol Europe—a mind whose specula-
tivc imagination was so vast that its
great scientific theories puzzled and
appalled the reasoning faculty."

This is the New York Times’ ac-
count of the arrival in this country
of Dr. Albert Einstein whose theory
of relativity has been so much dis—
cussed.

We are to have the opportunity to
hear about this noted scientist and
his theory on Tuesday at 12 o‘clock
in the auditorium. Dr. George M.
Conwell. professor of mathematics,
of the State College faculty. who
heard Mr. Einstein speak at Prince.-
ton,‘ will give a brief talk on the
subject. All summer students are '
urged to attend.
