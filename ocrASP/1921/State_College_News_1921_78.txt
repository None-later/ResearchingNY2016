FOUR THINGS

liour thin vs a man must learn to do
if he won d make his record true:
To think without confusion clearly;
To love his fellow—men sincerely;
To act from honest motives purely;
To trust in God and Heaven se-
curcly.‘ Henry Van Dyke.

THE SPIRIT OF—STATE

 

As>State has caught the spirit of
good fellowship in all forms of
work and play, so she has caught
the same spirit among her religious
organizations. in other parts of the
paper you have read something
about them and possibl you may
have read between the lines a little
about the kindly feeling that ex-
ists between them. it makes no
difference what church one repre-
sents—Catholic, Jewish, or an
kind of Protestant church. its
all the same with one's classmates
no matter what yotir religious be-
liefs are. What you yourself are
is what counts. Your friends like
you for what you are and for your
friendship, gooil sportsmanship,
good nature, etc., but they very
seldom stop to think what church
you attend. Don’t think that re-
ligion does not play an important
part at State, for it does. It‘s just
the fact that religious differences
do not loom up as big problems
that makes for such fine conditions.
Don't you think that this spirit is
representative of State, and her at-
titude toward other things?

Y. W. C. A.

One of the biggest and most in-
llucnlial m'ganizaliiiils of State is
the V. \V. (I. . it's purpose is to
promote tfhr tian ideals and activi-
ties on the campus and in our col-
lege community. Our organization
is niiiliatcd with the National Y. W.
C. A, and the \\"orld's t'hi'istiau
Student Federation.

The ﬁrst thing that Y. W. does in
the fall is to help make the fresh-
men feel at home. Soon after col‘
lege opens the Y. W. girls give the
entering C’ a reception in the
gymnasium. in thc month of Dc—
cembcr. not long before Christmas,
a bazaar. which is very attractive
indeed. is held. Lrsually a large
amount of money is made from
this.

 

 

 

Eunice Rice

At Christmas time a party is
given for the children from the
settlement and at various times
groups of girls visit the orphanage,
the old ladies' homes. and places
like that. These give one an in-
sight into a few of the worth while
things that the Y. -W. girls do.

The Y. W. C. A. house, which is
located at 747 Madison Avenue has
been very successful and has helped
to solve the problems of (formi-
torics. it is very popular among

 

the students as a place to live.
Miss Augusta Knapp, ’22, wil ic
house president for next year. The
officers of the association for the
year l92l-22 are: Eunice Rice, ‘22,
president; Louise Persons, '22, Vice

i president; Marion Hunter, ’22, sec-

rctury‘ Mae Wood, '23, treasurer;
Ruth \‘iiinney, 23, annual member.
During the winter Y. W. has sold
cakes from the bakery, candy, pea-
nuts and collere stationery. The
girls had a tab c in the lower hall.
Next winter they expect to have
charge of the tin-op. The selling
of cakes has been a line business
for V. W. and an asset to college.
Every A’Vutlllt‘stllly at 4:45 the
religious meetings are lield——-usu~
ally in the auditorium. Sometimes
they are wholly conducted by col-
lege students and many times good
speakers from different parts of the
city are broughl lierc.
liacli spring the Eastern Student
Conference is held at Silver llay,
'l'his yeaF ten delegates went from
here. The line speakers one bears
and the inspi'ation'one receives,
aside from the many good times
one has. pay a person well for go-
ing. ’l'hese conferences are big
things in the life of a college girl
interested in Y. W. (T. A. Some of
the inspiration received on beauti-
fiii Lake 'ieurge in the summer
makes Y. W, C. A. betl'c‘ at college
in llic winter.
