Fortunate. Wasn’t It?

At a banquet of churchmen a cer-
tain bishop had as his left-hand
companion a clergyman who was
completely bald. During dessert
the bald-headed vicar dropped his
napkin and stooped to pick it up.
At this moment the bishop, who
was talking to his right-hand neigh-
bor. felt a slight touch on his left
arm. He turned and, ~bcholding the
vicar’s pate on a level with his
elbow, said: "No, thank you; no
melon."
