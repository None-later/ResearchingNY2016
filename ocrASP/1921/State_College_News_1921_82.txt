'aus‘c of their sameness, we are go-
ing to have something entirely dif-
ferent this Friday evening. Docs-
n't the word carnival appeal to you?
That's what is awaiting you this
week. Early in the season we gave
you a little idea of what a big thingr
the usual carnival is. This was a
great eveitt last year and we hope
to make it as hi3: a one this sum-
mer.

()ne of the interesting things
that will take place is the stunts by
some of the regular college stu—
dents. They're good at these. for
stunts are one of the hit: attractions
at college in the winter— both for
those. taking; part and for those

 

looking on. lf they aren’t good it
won't he hecattse of lack of prac—
tice. There will he hooths in the
gym where things will he sold and
the llL‘Sl part of it all will he the
decorations. in short it will he just
as you would expect a real carni-
val to he. it would take tor) long to
tell Uf everythinp,r that can he ex-
pected, Come anywa' and he, sur-
prised ! Everyone. old and young.
is asked to have a “foolish” time for
one evening of the summer ses-
sion.

At noon Miss Futterer will give a
reading. “ Modern Verse." It is not
necessary to say anything more
about her charm and ability. That
would he superﬂuous as any of you
who have attended her other read-
ings know. Tell your friends about
her and brim.Y them too.
