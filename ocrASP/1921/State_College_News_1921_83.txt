MORE ENTHUSIASM

 

 

The instructors, in Summer
School certainly know how to give
long assignments and lots of work,
but one can't be dissatisﬁed when
he stops to consider the short time
in which the material has to be cov-
ered. it is to be expected that we
have to work quite a lot, but we
mustn’t forget that there is another
side to the six weeks that we spend
here.

The Community Choruses, the
liriday night entertainments with
the get—to-gethcrs afterwards, the
organ recitals, the excursions, and
everything else are planned to take
care of that other side of life, The
attendance at all of the affairs so
far has been quite satisfactory, but
still there is a little lack of inter-
est and enthusiasm. We need a
iitte more pop and fun to make
conditions per cot—they are nearly
perfect now. Everybody come to
everythingl Leave the dignity at
home and have a good timcl Then
no one can go home without some
pleasant memories aside from those
of work.

"A little nonsense now and

Hen
Is relished by the best of
men.”

POSTERS

 

If you are at all observing, you
have all noticed the ﬁne posters
that have been serving a two-fold
purpose in decorating our bulletin
boards and in helping the publicit
committee. They represent much
work, abiity and good-will on the
part of the art department, for
which the committee and the col-
lcge in general are very grateful.

The productions look very inter-
esting and.thc place where they are
produced is even more interesting.
The work of this department is a
worthwhile part of State's program
this summer. We feel that the at—
tention of the students should be
drawn to the importance of the
work to avoid the feeling that the
good looking posters just happened
to be on the bulletin boards.

RURAL SOCIAL
PROBLEMS

 

The new course in Rural Social
Problems given by Professor Adam
alker of the Economics De-
partment of State College, is prov-
ing to be a decided success. The
course includes lectures and open
discussions of rural problems.
Rural life is considered from the
social. economic, religious, and ed-

 

ucational viewpoints. Its advan-

tages and disadvantages, as com-

pared with tit-ban life, are carefully

considered. 'From time to time, in-
formal, oral reports, based on as-
si ncd readings in binoks and pcri-
o icals, are given by the students.
The material presented is based
upon fact and actual experience as
far' as possible, an effort being ma e
to avoid the empt theory which
has caused so mile of the misun-
derstanding which now exists be-
tween the tirban and rural dweller.
This course is of interest and value
not only to those who are brought
in contact with rural life thru their
work, but also to those who thru
environment have been acquainted
with only one type of community.

- WE WANT YOUR

IMPRESSIONS

 

As the Summer Session is almost
two-thirds over we believe that
everyone has formed by this time
some impression of life at State
College in the summer. Nothing
would delight as more during the
next week than to have a host of
comments pour into the “News
Oflicc" which is near the mail box.
Your honest imircssion and criti-
cisms will be oi great interest to
every other member of the Summer
Student Body.

OPPORTUNITIES FOR
BACHELOR’S DEGREE

The large number of normal

school graduates curolicd this year
in the Summer Session will be in-
terested in the fact that the College
offers special opportunities to them
to earn a bachelor’s degree. A
graduate of a New York State Nor-
mal School is ordinarily able to
earn the College degree in two or
two and one-half years. Normal
school graduates who look forward
to becoming high school tenchch
are expected to qualify for a major
and minor in the usual way and
must satisfy the announced require-
ments for the major and minor.
V Provision is also made for nor-
mal school graduates who expect
to become supervisors, principals
and superintendents to earn a do
grce without a major and minor,
One who elects to do this fol-
lows a general course to meet his
own individual needs and the cred-
its he must earn are determined
upon after consultation with the
Dean. Some ﬁfteen or twenty nor-
mal school graduates have already
submitted their credentials under
this latter plan and are expecting
to return for future summer- ses—
sions and possibly during the next
College year. -

THE MASTER’S DEGREE

 

An increased mtmbcr of gradu-
ates of other colleges are seeking
the Master's degree at State Col-
lege, The Dean has received crc—
dcntiais this summer from several
candidates of other institutions who

'expcctto return to future summer

sessions to earn the degree. It is
now possible for one who is a grad—
uate from a recognized college to
earn the Master's degree in (our
summer sessions. One who comes
from another college, who has
taken the general arts course, ﬁnds
it desirable in working for our
Master's degree to do spacial work
in the general field of education.

STUDENT ORGANtZA-
axons

in addition to the honorary and
secret socities State College sup-
ports several student organizations.
These clubs are connected with
various departments in that they
have been organized to promote in-
terest along special lines.

CHEMISTRY CLUB

The Chemistry Club was founded
December 13, rpm, its purpose be-
ing to promote the spirit ofvchem-
ical'rcsearch. it is now the oldest
existing club in college. Last year
it cs‘sayed to publish a paper,"Thc
Harmonc” which proved so suc-
cessful that it has been cnthusi~
astically continued. Chemical lit-
erature of every type, serious or
funny, is published to the extent of
four or live times a year in this
paper. '

The club itself holds its regular
meetings the second Friday after-
noon aud the last Wednesday even-
ing of cvury month. At these meet-
Ings reports are made on current
magazines and papers are submit-
ted by the members, But more
popular even than these formal
meetings are the informal oncs held
llldilc spring and fail. the spring
being the time of the “(Thom Club
l'icnic.” and the fall, that of the
bi}.r initiation and dance.

At this initiation those people are
taken into the club who are taking
advanced chemistry courses and
desire to join and those who,
thouin still unadvanccd who are
willing.r to present a paper before the
club as a token of their desire and
ability to join.
