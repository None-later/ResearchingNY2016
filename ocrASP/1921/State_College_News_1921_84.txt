FIRST SMOKER FOR MEN
Sigma Nu Kappa Entertain:

 

With the Dean holding himself
res onsible for Thursday's storm
am the coolness which followed it
that evening, everyone else who at-
tended the men's get-together had
better attach himself to some
responsibility which made this
featherless party a huge success.
The affair, fostered by the Sigma
Nu Kappa fraternity at .whose
house it was held, was the first of
its kind in the history of State Col-
lege summer sessions. The house
and the immediate campus were
prettily decorated with Japanese
lanterns, flags, and electric lights,
while Victrola music, a handshake,
and " Camels ” greeted each guest
as he arrived,

The fireworks of the evening
slnrirtl when the factilty hom-
hardetl the students in a game of
Serve-Us Ball. Again and again
the students returned the fire, but
the heavy artillery under the com-
mum] of Professor Rislcy and
Coach Snavely soon proved too
much for'the opposing light bri-
gade, and the latter was ﬁnally
forced to retreat with great loss.
The referee featured in the victory.

Lest the excitement might ahate
too soon .\lr. llCSSt'I‘ continued the
war by singing " lrish Names ” and
“ Give a Man a Girl lie (fan Love.”
Mia Lfaudlyn assisted him at the
phno

Dean llorncr then continued the
barrage with a series of articula-
tions during which he continually
reminded himself that he was not
dreaming but that the large gather-
ing of men before him were really
students at State College.

The feature event of the eveningr
was a sleight-of—lland performance
by Mr. Miller, which successfully
disproved all the laws of Nature.
Not even the facnty dared to ask
him questions, lest he might work
his magic spells on them.

Both armies took the above omen
as a sign from heaven to cease lins—
lilities, and all joint-ti in chorus
singing under Dr. '.|‘honipson, War
and peace songs were. the feature.
To make the treaty more secure,
cigars, ice cream and cakes: were
served, and, when they could hold
no more, the armies disbanded.

The committee in charge iii-
cluded: George Schiavnnc. chair-
man; Lester 'l‘, llnbhard, l7. Her-
rick Coniiers, llarold Baldwin,
Alden Marks, Edmund Osborne,
llarold Holmes, Richard O'l‘lrien
and Charles Grubcl.

“The Recitation”

On Wednesday evening, jnly
27th, the principals held their fourth
meeting, Mr, lloleomh, of the State
Department, spoke on “The Recita-
tion." He mentioned seven guides
to successful teaching. The teacher
should he definite in dealing with
his subject matter. He must inaiu-
tain good posture and stand on his
feet during at least part of the reci—
tatimi. Assignments of lessons
should be deﬁnite with references
for collateral reading and the as-
signmeuts should he made at the be-
ginning of the recitation period. if
the instructor himself shows inter-
est, it is not a difficult matter to ob«
tain and hold the interest of the
class. All instructors should be
sure that the pupils grasp a ﬁnal
summary of a discussion which is
correct. It is such an easy matter
for pupils to obtain an erroneous‘
idea from a hit and miss conclu—
siou. Lastly, the teacher should
hold to the point. Mr. lloleomh’s
ideas were based upon practical ex-
perience and of value to all teachers.

ct everyone come to the next
meeting. it is not deﬁnitely de-
cided whether Mr. Skinner or Mr.
Wiley of the State Department is to
be the speaker.

SISTER CLASSES

While we are busy studying and
having line times during the sum-
nier session, there are throughout
the state and possibly in other
states a host of young people who
are planning to be freshman at State
College in the fall.

in a few weeks they will he re—
ceiving letters from members of the
iiiiiior class welcoming them and
offering assistance in any possible
way. This is the ﬁrst evidence of
the kindness and helpfulness of a
junior sister.

0n the opening days of the first
semester, ’23 wil greet its sister
class and assist in finding boarding
places and in makqur the new-com-
ers at home. Numerous questions
come up which the freshman
ﬁnds her junior sister can almost
always answer, and she is sure of
knowing at least one at the begin-
ning of social affairs. Although
active guardianship ceases after the
Junior—Freshman party, the sistcrly
feeling remains; and when the
juniors have become seniors and
are about to he graduated, it is the
siﬁter class that regrets it most of
