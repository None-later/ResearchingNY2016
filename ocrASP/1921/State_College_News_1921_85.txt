THE TEACHER’S " IF ”

 

If you can take your dreams into
the classrooms.
And always make them part of
cach day‘s wor —
If you can face the countless petty
problems
Nor turn from them nor ever try
to Shirk--
If you can live so that the child
you work with
Deep in his heart knows you to
he a man——
If you can take "I can't" from out
his language
And put in place a vigorous "I

If you can take Love with you to
the classroom,
And yet on I’lrmncss ncvcr shut

If you can teach a child the love of

we make it,
That he himself can he his only

If you can tell him something of
the heavens
Or something of the wonder of a
star—-

If you. with simple hits of truth
and honon

Hi5 hcttt-r scli occasionally

And yet not overdo nor have him

As one who is inclined to ever
preach—

If you impart to him a hil,of liking
