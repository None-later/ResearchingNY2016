DRAMATICS AND ART
ASSOCIATION

 

'l‘he Dramatics and Art Associa—
tion was founded in 1919 for the
purpose of arousing a greater in-
terest in dramatics and the line arts
and of giving the students more ad—
vantages in both these liclds. The
paymént of the student tax auto—
matically make each student a
member of the association, Thus
it includes practically the entire
student body and insures to every—
one an equal share in the benefits
derived, The ass ciation is ﬁnanced
by an appropriation from the stu-
dent lax fund.

The control of the organization
rests with the Dramatics and Art
Council of nine members, three fac-
ulty members and two students
from each of the upper clascss. The
council elects its own ofﬁcers and
transaets all the business of the as—
SUCialiOll.

The events put forth by the
Dramatics and Art Association this
year have attracted much attention.
The big,r feature was John Drink-
water's lecture here on February 8.
The four one-act plays presented
just befan mid-years were of un—
usual interest.‘ in April Miss Fnt
terer read in the college auditorium
"Quality’Street," by James M. Bar-
rie. Everyone enjoyed the travel-
ing art exhibition of copies of some
of the paintings by noted artists.
The annual New York tri) was ar—
ranged to include some of the best
