A WORD FROM THE
DIRECTOR

 

The Fifth Summer Session at
State College. which will come to a
close at the end of this week, has
been'an unusual ouein many ways.
The enrollment has been particu-
larly gratifying. That something
over eight hundred "teachch and
prospective teachers are ﬁnding our
courses attractive and "helpful is
proof of the sound development of
the summer school' idea at State
Collette and convincing_evidence

that the Summer Session should be

a permanent institution.
Mere numbers are not our object,

'hbiiIéver. 'lt' Isl now clear, from .the
‘gyowth-uf the Summer Session dur—

in]: the last five years, that students
wdl come as rapidly as'wc‘can plan

 

to care for then}. The quality of
our work, the size of our classes,
the way we actually meet the necds

’ of teachers, the building, of u. repti-

tatiou for thoroughness and help.
fulncss in everything; we do, are of
vastly more importance than num-
bers. 'l‘he enrollment of men this
summer is a good sign. it is an
unusual sight to see one hundred
scventy~livc men in our corridors.
They are very welcome. The
teaching profession needs them
and State College plans its work in
both summer and winter sessions
to be of service to them.

’.f‘he personnel of the enrollment
is interesting. About one hundred
of our regular students are lit at-
tendance. This means that only
about 12 per cent. of the enrollment
is drawn from our regular student
body and that over seven hundred
students have come to us this sum~
nier from the outside. The College
is glad to be of service to a lilil~
ited number of college students in

the Summer Session and to afford-

them an opportunity to make up
deficiencies or to gain time, but the
keynote of the Summer Session is
ilie teacher and his problems, The
character and experience of our
friends from the outside this sum-
mer may be noted from thefacts
that there are in the number one
hundred fifty college graduates,
about one hundred normal school
graduates, seventy-the superinten»
dents and principals. one hundred
fifty high school teachers and two
hundred and thirty elementary
school teachers.

‘f‘nc daily attendance upon i: scs
has been remarkably good, Many
of the audilors who elected courses
for visitation at the opening of lhe
Session have not missed a single
day. and the Director has hardly
been called upon to lSSllt' a dozen
excuses for enforced absences on
the part of students seeking credit.
The spirit of work and attention to
business has been splendid. The
student social committee has been
intelligcilll' active in providing en-
tertainment and diversion and is en-
titled to Very great credit for mak-
ing the Session a pleasant one for
everybody. The cililors and man-

 

:igcr ol the News have done a good .

piece of work and a very unusual
one. There are few summer ses—
sions in America that can point if)
such a snec ssful, entci'prising col-
lege paper. i could say more. if
the space permitted, about the line
spirit of our student body and the
zeal and enthusiasm of our instruc-
tors. ficnuine teachers almcvs cn-
joy teaching those who enjoy being
taught. A number of our regular
faculty have stood by the Summer
Sc ‘ion from its beginning. Our
int: instructors this year have
enriched our work and have fitted
in harmoniously and happily to our
scheme,

I hopt‘ sinrerely that instructors
and students alike will have an en-
loyablc Vacation before the work
of the schools and colleges begins
in September. it has been my
wish duriniz the Session to make
the acquaintance of all of our stu-
dents. 'l‘hat has been hardly pos-
siblc. but i think i have, in the
course of the day's work met
nearly every one. and i. mean it as
a-tributc to the teaching profession
when i say that not one in the
nearly eiitht hundred wlimri l have
met has been out of sorts or dis-
gruntled or disagreeable. So much
good nature in hot weather is truly
remarkable.

\N’ith best wishes and with the
hope that'lhc Sixth Summer Ses-
sion may see many of' you here
again, l ‘am,

V 'V'ery siuccrclv yours.

MY IMPRESSIONS OF
s. c. ’1‘. IN 192i

Anyone wl.o wishes a summer in
which cdu‘atiou, social, and were-
ational life are combined in the best
proportions . iould spend six Weeks
at the summer session of some
college, preferably the New York
Stale College for 'l‘aichers.

The curriculum hcre is broad and
varied. 'lll addition to the regular
classi' 'pcriuds which are held
live days a week, there are lectures,
ineetin,s, and informal talks on
subjects connected with thc'school
work. lliit in spite of the'euipha-
srs put upon studies and the
amount of work accomplished in
six weeks, the social and recrea-
tional side of life i not neglected,
flue has only to glance at the front
page of the College News where
events for the. WCt'lt are listed to
see how many good times are
planned for_the students at the.
summer session,

lnt one of the finest things about
the college is the spirit of friend~
liness and good fellowship which
is everywhere evident. Many of
the regular students are present. at
the summer session, and all show
by word and action that they are
willing and anxious to maintain lhc
reputation of the rolleu- for high
standards of scholarship. genial
companionship and wholesome fun.

WHERE LIFE IS WORTH
THE LIVING

 

To exist is one thing; to live is
quite another. And often we do
not realize that we have merely
cxisfcil until we conu- re ly to live.
lior life is so much a series of cou~
trusts,

When one comes to S. C. '1‘.,
when one becomes a member of its
summer so sinn, one begins to r ’l
iii/C that living.r is a very pleasur—
able mailer and he feels that he has
been content before with mere ex-
isting.

There is so much vital interest in
it all. The vii'ilc yet Sylllpflllll‘llt:
stimuli of classes. both in the more
formal aspect of their instructor
and also in their comradship,—tbc
ncnuiuc pleasure of the College
i'afherings and excursions so
deftly cmnmiutcle work and play
that one enters into the former
with the same zest that he goes
about the latter.

College never was so winsome
than in our beloved State.

 

   

IMPRESSIONS OF
SUMMER SCHOOL

 

An impression is tlrfincd as “the
immediate effect produced upon the
mind by a sensation, passion; or
emotion; an indistinct or vague no-
tion. remembrance, or belief," One
cannot, "however, have exposed
himself to the'various associations
of life at. State College Summer
Session for four summers without
generalizing those impressions into
a (lelinite. deeper significance.

 

- ,WhaHirc they expecting to gain,
these eight hundred bits of "indi-
vidualizcd chaos", (excuse please,
Mir. Philosopher)? Is it merely a
little inenuil lumber to replenisii a
depleted stock to use next fall )er-
haps as scaffolding by eager little
i)fllltlL‘l‘S of new mansions? is it a
degree to lend’ professional prest-
ige? Or do those eyes, old with
aims of desire, see a promise of
f’isgali iii the distance?

There have always been philisop-
hers to interpret for as experience,
to tell us how to adjust to life with
the least, or perhaps greatest, in-
convenience to sell. "Eat, drink,
and be In y.” says one. “(Tuiti-
vale an indifference to everything.“
says another. “Sack cloth mid
ashes," says a third. Some are so
far above the' ordinary, w-ak little
accidents of nature that they scorn
even to give advice and look with
satiric pity from the safe height of
“Weissuichtivo” upon the dumb
show of life.

 

Pilli none of these oft expressed
philosophies will our experiences at
State College supply .data for sup-
port of their them" The play,
the work, the .oeiations, the
ideals, point a way through the
truths of the body, the mind, and
llu’ heart to a vision of the
Promised Land. We catch a
glimpse of that first requisite of all
teaching, how to live, "to lch
broadly, fully, completely, on an
active responsiveness to life at
every point.”
