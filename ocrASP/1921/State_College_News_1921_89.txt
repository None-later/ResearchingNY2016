DR. VWILEY TALKS

On Wednesday evening. August
3. Dr. Wiley spoke to the princi-
pals and supervisors in Room ill
on “Some Problems in School Ad-
ministration am] How We Are
Meeting Them." His talk con-
tained some interesting facts about
the great progress in the’South.
It was clearly understood that the
school is a vital part of the
community and as such is deserv-
ing of much more attention than
it has been receiving. The small
4 increase in. the cost of maintaining

schools I9l9—20 over the cost in
‘ 916-17 was compared to the great
increase in commercial cost in the
same years. The reat scientiﬁc
problem is that of Inding suitable

 

teachers, ones who can meet the
individual needs of the he s and
girls in the right ways. Tie fact
that one out of. every
teachers is attending summer
school somewhere proves that the
profession is raising its own stand-
ard and that cheap certiﬁcation is
a thing of the past. Dr. Wiley pre-
sented some worthwhile plans for
better coo oration betweenthe nor-
mal schoo and the rural teacher.

The hygiene syllabus and the
English syllabus are now in print
and will be out before September I.
Committees are now working on
other syllahi but these will not
be out until later in the fall.

On Wednesday evening, August
ID. at the last meetingr of principals
and supervisors Dr. Downing. As-
sistant Commissioner of Higher
Education. will‘ talk on "Some Es-
scntials for a Good School."
