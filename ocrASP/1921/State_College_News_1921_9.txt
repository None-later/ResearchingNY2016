Perfectly Sale

“I reckon you have to watch
your pocketbook nn' overcoat au’
watch, 2111' so on, pretty close, don‘t
you?” a western visitor to New
York asked a friend, a native oi
that metropolis, as they were stark
int: out to view the city; and, de-
spite the citizen's assurance that no
more than Ol‘tlit‘lil" vigilance was
required, the wes t'ner proceeded
“ to keep his eye skinned.” much to
his friend’s amusement.

Presently they entered a Cafe for
luncheon. The New Yorker was
discoursiug unyly upon the great-
ne55 of his native city, when he nb«
servctl that the other had an ex-
pression on his face much like'that
of a cat at a mouse-hole.

“What are you watching so
closely?” he inquired.

“Just keepin' an eye on my orer<
coat,” the other replied.

The New Yorker laughed. “ Oh.
the coat's all right. I’m not worry-
ing about mine, you see, and they're
hanging together.’

"No, they ain't,” the westerncr
drawlcd. “Mine’s still there, but
yours is gone—teller walked out
with it ’bout ten minutes or so
ago.”
