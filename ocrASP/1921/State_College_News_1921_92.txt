useful career. lllit for some pur-
pose hidden from worldly eyes he
was called froin this life.

While he was at allege he
worked uuceasingly fol ' r'
in the routine of stu.

best. He lead the 1921 'Varsity

ager. In football. basketball and
track he helped to bring honor to
his class and his college. Never
seeking personal glory, he worked
ill his own quiet way.

member of Kappa Delta lx’hn Fra-

gymnasium work as an assistant
instructor alid as an expert in up-

With his passing everyone who
knew him feels a loss. Those who
were his friends have lost a true
friend and helper. 'llut they can
never fail to retain the sincere qual-

To those whose loss is greatest,
whose grief is deepest. to his
father. mother. sisters and brother,
may the kind Father in Heaven
give consolation and comfort.

Aside front posters and hulh-tiu—
hoard announcements the medium
through which everyone learned of
the above-mentioned events alid
many other matters of importance
was the summer edition of the
“State College News." The pub-

students was a feature that particle
lavrly characterized this ion.
The venture proved successful
from both the reader’s and staff's
viewpoint. ft is hoped that volume
1 is just the beginning of a per-
manent summer paper.
