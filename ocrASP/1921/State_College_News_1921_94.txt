S. C. T. LETTERS
The New Point System

This article is merely a gentle
reminder to former State collegians
that last. year we adopth a new
point system by which every State
College girl can win her S. (I. T.
letters. Let this little bit of in-
lormation serve as a “pusher” to
every freshman. Get your class
numerals sometime, anzl the year
’21 is ireferable to the year ’25.
Think how nice it is to be able to
wear a big purple and gold S. C. T
on your sweater and let people
know you belong to State. G. A. A.
now has a way by Which you can
all earn your numerals and letters,
that is, if you work hard enough.
Last year a few girls won their lot-
ters by playing basketball, but now
we have a system by which with
a little perseverance, you can say:
"I: won these at_State College."

G A. A., under the supervision of
Miss Bennett and Miss Card,
worked out the following “point
system:" By coming out for dif-
ferent events you earn so many
points. and upon gaining 40 points
you win your class numerals, and
the girl winning the most num-
ber of points at the end of the year

 

wins a cup. All those winning 60
or more points will receive 5. C. T.
letters. These numerals and letters
Will be different lrom any others
you may have won in basketball or
elsewhere, so it is up to everyone
to try out for this. At the end ol
the year the girl having the most
pouits receives a cup given by the
. A. A.

The following are the points
given for each event:

For each basketball practice at—
tended, 1 point.

For each basketball game played
in, 2 points.
