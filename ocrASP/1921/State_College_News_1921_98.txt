“The thing that impressed me
most in all France was the art, the
wonderful art in historical monu-
ments, splendid paintings and un-
usual architecture. All the build-
ings are beautiful, even those rnosl
simply designed. Of course, much
relief is now going on all over in
France and the warmest sympathy
exists between America and France.

Send-OK for Legionnaires

“When the 104 Legionnaires were
leaving France all the orphans from
miles around—the war orphans
adopted by Americans—came to
Saint Lazare and cheered the boys.
Each child carried an Ameri-
can flag and all shouted three cheers
at the tops of their voices. . Bands
played patriotic airs. The station
there was elaborately decorated with
American flags. Tile scene, upon
the boys' departure from France,
was so impressive that it brought
tears to many eyes. As the train
stopped at Roucn the mayor deliv-
ered a farewell address, and at
l-lavre they were accorded a cordial
welcome.

“On reaching New York the wel-
coming contingent occupied the po-
lice hoat with Mayor Hylan. The
tire department hand, from the bow
of the police boat, greeted the 'Lco—
poldina' with The Star Spangled
Banner,’ and greetings from both
boats were exchanged across the

' water.

“John G. Emory, national com-
mander of the American Legion, is-
sued a statement immediately after
stepping ashore saying that the wei-
come extended the Legionnairc-s
abroad exceeded all expectations.

“The [.egionnaires duringr their
stay overseas spent nineteen days in
France and two days in Belgium.
While with Marshal Foch they were
given assurance that he would come
to America for the disarmament
conference in time to be the guest
of honor at the third annual conven-
tion of the Legion at Kansas City.

France extended from B0rdeaux to

"Paris is ﬁlled with Americans.
At the University there were 250
foreign students and 75 of these
were Americans. The University is
a big international league in itself.
Politicsin France at present is, as
you know, upside down.

“I attended a very interesting
meeting of the lower house of Far-

the London conference. The meet-
ing was unusual from many angles
and decidedly interesting and in-
structive.

"This summer I visited many
cities in southern France which are
so rich in Roman history. Some of

DR. GRAVES DELIVERS
ADDRESS

The Principals of the Normal
Schools of New York State. Dr.
Wiley, the Assistant Commissioner
of Education, and the faculty of
New York State College were pres~
cut at the ﬁrst Student Assembly to
welcome the new Commissioner of
Education, Dr. Frank Picrpont
Graves. Dr. Thompson led the
strident body in singing "College of
the Empire State." Then Dr. Bru-
bacher, after inviting the surplus
freshmen to occupy the front seats,
introduced Commissioner Graves.

Dr. Graves delivered a very inter-
esting address on the subject,
“Character.” Character is what we
are, have been and shall he. The
two great elements which enter into
the formation of character are
habits and ideals. Character is a
combination of habits, some good
and some bad. Each habit which
we form is an asset to us or a lia-
hility. it is either a useful. obedient
servant or a hard, cruel master.
i-iahits are hard to form, but when
they are once made it is very difﬁ-
cult to change them, whether they
are good or bad.

Our habits are determined by the

Aristotle’s ideal was that we should
show the mean between two ex-
tremes; we, should follow the mid-
dle course. Another historical ideal
is that when we do anything we
should consider what would be the
result if everyone acted in the same
way; if our act were universal.
This is an intellectual and unemo—
tional ideal. Tire greatest ideal of
the world is that \vliiclnvas taught
by its greatest teacher.
“Whatsoever ye would that men
do linto you, do ye also unto them."
