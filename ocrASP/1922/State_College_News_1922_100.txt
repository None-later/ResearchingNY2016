MISS BICKING EXPLAINS
USE OF PHONOGRAPH
On Friday, Jilly 28, Miss flicking.
supervisor of music at Evansville.
Indiana, spoke to the students in the
auditorium. Miss ﬂicking gave an
interestingr demonstration and discus-
sion of the “Place of the Phono—
graph in Class Room instruction in
.Vusic." Several records which are
used in the different grades were

played on a Victrola.
uce public school music meant
vocal music alone. Today the child
is taught how to use his voice to the
hest advantage, how to sing well, and
how to appreciate music. There are
some children who can not express
themselves so well through the voice
as by some musical instrument. It is
for them that free instruction in in
slrumental music is given in many
public schools.
“Did you know." asked Miss Rick-

MR. RICE GIVES EXPERI-
ENCE IN R. E. C.

()n 'l‘hnrsday. July 27. hir. Rice
gave an interesting talk on his expe-
rience with uneducated amt illiterate
foreigners in the army. Mr. Rice
spoke of the work done in a Recruit—
ing Educational Center.

Psychological tests were given the
men shortly after their arrival, and
they were classilietl according to their
standing, A. It, _ , ‘

The work done at‘ the i. ii. C. was
in connection with the man's army
life. The main purpose of the school
was to make soldiers. and a second
ohjevt to teach English to make good
soldiers. Not much time was devoted
to arithmetic. hut more to spelling
reading, writing, interpretation and
oral work. J .

Mr. Rice cited the followingr ttndcr
lvinr! psychological principles for the
basis of the school:

i. llumnn appeal.

2. lly su'r'rcstihility.

a. Teaching that he should put
forth his hest effort ior the govern;
ment which was helping him so much.

3. fly camouﬂagng suggestions for
proper hahits. virtues and duties.

4. Advertising the American army
h_v letters which the men wrote home.

5. Promoting a broader mastery of
Foolish and a higher esteem for
ideals through this army school. '

The work of the school was divided
into grades. Each grade was snhdi-
vided into ﬁve sections. There was
a special English class in conversa-
tion for those who had no knowledge
of English. The direct method was
used almost entirely. Examinations

A VARIETY OF SELECTIONS

 

GIVEN BY MR. CANDLYN—

MR. HESSER ASSISTS

A large number of students were
present at the organ recital August 2.
l’rof. Candlyn's rcnlering of the or-
gan selections was highly enjoyed.
Mr. Hesscr gave two solos in his
usual charming manner. Before the
beginning of the recital, Prof. Catni-
lyn spoke of a change in the etched-
uled program. “Deep River," a

'uegro spiritual. was to be given as

No.4. Instead of this selection, Mr.
Hesser favored the audience with
vocal solos. The program was as fol-
lows:
l. Fantasia and Fugue on
B. A. C. H.  . . . . . . . . ..Liszt
This piece is founded on the notes
B flat, A, C and B natural. it being
the Gertman equivalent of B natural.
The letters forming llach’s name
have attracted many composers, in-
cluding Schumann and Reger. The
particular example 'hy Liszt is unlike
the usual academic Fugue; in fact it
can hardly be called a Fugue in the
strict sense of the word. It is decid~
edly dramatic in style, and shows the
influence of the romantic school in
music.
2. An Indian Legend.  .. .Candlyn
The ﬁrst theme is formed from
the notes of :I Pcntatonic scale——-G. B
tlai. C, D, F. Many Indian, negro,
Scotch and Chinese tunes are written
on some form of Pciitatotiic scale
(for instance, “ Living Law ” and
“ Auld Lang Srnc"). The key
changes to the relative major for the
second part amt an “ astiuato ” figure
of four notes can he heard against the
theme played by the right hand.
There is the usual return to part one,
the piece ending,r quietly.
3. Spring Song  . . . . . . “Hollins
light number [IV the accom-
plished-blind organist of Edinburgh,
Scotland.
4. Two Sacred Songs.
(.1) A Saviour of the Woritl...Buck
(h) Arise, Shine, for Thy Light Is
Come . . . . . .  .l\lacl)crmid
Mr. Ernest G. I’lcsser I
5. Taecata from 5th Symphony..
Widor

One of the most popular pieces
ever penned. The use of 16th notes
continues the toccata. and a digni-
ﬁed theme (somewhat Gregorian in
tlavor) is heard in the pedals.
