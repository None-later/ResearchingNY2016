LET’S HAVE PEPI

Sninnicr school not only furnishes
the opportunity for intellectual devel-
opment, but it affords us limitless
changes for physical development.
Washington park is not ﬁve minutes’
walk from the college, and the tennis
cotirts are free to the students as
well as to the inhabitants of the city.
We are entitled to the use of these
well-kept courts for tivo hours, and
that with no remuneration on our
part. Let us all make the most of the
park and its amusements. Let us
resurrect our old tennis shoes or buy
a pair of new ones, and either play
or make a stab at playing tennis. We
want good times as well as work at
summer school. and even if our main
aim is educational, do we lose any.-
tliing by the few hours devoted to
sports? Indeed, we do not lose. We
ream. Sports and exercise develops
an alert and active mind. It also
strengthens us bodily and improves
our health. If we engage in outdoor
exercise we have better muscles and
moral tone for the long winter
months. aml tennis is one of the
sports that is not too strenuous for
the hot summer days. So let us chal-
lenge our friends to a little. fun and
exercise for the next few weeks.

 

OUR STUDENT ASSOCIA-
TION

Immediately upon entering summer
school we were asked to invest one
of our dollars. and the interest 'has
been accruing on everv Friday night
since we parted with our money. The
little whit" card has given us en-
trance to the auditorium, where we
have heard concerts, whistling and
the “human phonograph," and at the
Student-Faculty reception we became
acquainted with our faculty and our
fellow-stiulcnts. One of the ad-
vantages of the Friday night enter-
tainmeuts s the fact that we meet our
friends u ion the" are in a jolly mood
and have forgotten all the disagree-
able incidents of the class-room and
the cmharrasmnents of poor recita-
lions.

It has also been the work of the
Student Association that has made
possible the organized trips on Satur~
days. The various Committees Iiave
seen to it that we have not left suin-
mcr school without an his‘orical
knowledge of the battlefield of Sara-
toga. The association has also seen
that plenty of husses were hired to
carrv us to Indian Ladder and along
the Mohawk Trail. and it will also be

AN iupnnssmu or SUMMER
scnom.

Years ago I used to hear that
one of the advantages of the teach-
ing profession was the long summer
vacation, when one could wluttle
sticks all day and read novels all
night. Nowadays, however, the
teacher does not hetakc himself to
the pasture fence with his Jack-
knifc, or to the easy chair, the
reading lamp, and the latest fiction,
when June releases him from the
professional routine. Instead he
goes to summer school and works
hard. He does work respectany
hard, but over the summer session
hovers a genial spirit which makes

is work easy. The spirit of va-
cation pcrvadcs the summer ses-
sion, touching work with a spirit of
play and impartingr an informality
which the longer sessions of the
college year lack. In this way the
teacher of to-(Iay makes his va-
cation prolitablc. and at the saute
time pleasant—H. W. l'Iastings.

 

RETURNED COMPLIMENTS
Life is but a GOLDEN DREAM,
Things are seldom as they seem.
Pianos hung upon the wall
Sometimes take a sudden fall.

The BEAUTY of the blotter
That rests upon your desk,
When spattcrcd with piano keys

If filled with notes, no doubt.

INDIAN LADDER TRIP

The “Indian Ladder ” hikers
It'fl. the college in husxcs last Sat‘
urday morning at 9100. After a
pleasant ride of about eighteen
miles, they were ready for the mile
walk along the old Indian Hill to
the ton of thc I'Icldcribcri: Monti-
tain. Nearly everyone was par-
tially fatigued from the long walk.
but some ventured to: go down the
historic ” Indian Ladder” for the
cold spring water. Then the party
ate the nicnic dinner and enjoyed
themselves in snappy conversation
for about an hour. - A number of
snapshots were taken of the differ-
ent groups while eating their
lunch. After dinner the IIiology
students gathered many specimens
of different rocks and plant life.
liven thouin everyone was pro-
vided with a whistle, a few strayed
away and were thought to be lost
for a while. The hot sun of the
afternoon soon induced many to
assemble under the cool shade of
the large trees and hich rocks and
play games. When groups of peo-
ple are somewhat tired they usu-
ally fcel silly. This was found
true in this case. Everyone felt; in
the mood of cheering and singing.
When the party arrived at the col»
lege all 6:00 I". M., everyone had a
self-assurance that it was the end
of a “perfect day.”
