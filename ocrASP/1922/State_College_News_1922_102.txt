Many of the students of the sum-
iner session wiio are living in board-
ing houses are undoubtedly wonder
mg any State College has no system
of residence halls adequate for the
needs of the students during botii the
college year and the summer session.
It mayiiiterest theih to know that the
Alumni Association of the college is
conducting a drive to raise, funds to
secure for State College proper and
adequate residence halls. Up to June,
192.5, somewhat over $50,000 has been
pledged or paid in. it is hoped that
nefore tiie drive is eoiiipieted next
fall that $300,000 will he raised. One
of the properties which the commit-
tee is considering is the Cooper estate
directly apposite the Science itiiildiiig
on Western avenue. To carry on he»
gotiations for any property, the coni-
mittee needs more funds and iiioi'e
pledges. It is consequently appealing
to the students of the summer is ion
to help.

The committee believes that many
of the ' miner school ; w ‘
ccive ' ‘tlllCC in their proi'
preparation at State Lollete,
wiio know the actual needs of resi~
deuce balls at State College, will he
glad to plcdg‘e thenisthcs to give a
minimum of teii dollars. wii.ci_i may
he pad in tive animal instaliiiieuts. in
other words at the rate of two dull ii's
per year. The pledge lieiizg asked
from every alumnus oi the Loticg‘c is
$100.00, payable in five years. There
is no objection to any other group of
interested people, like .siiimuei' scs
sion students, making the same
pledge. In case one does lllvl wiin to
pictigc any deliiiite amount, lie may
contribute whatever he washes.

Since this is a State institution.
there may he a ion regai‘iirii:
the necessity of raising this snin
aiiioii;,r tiie alumni and students. (,iov-
eriior Miller and the Chairman of the
Senate l“lll\‘lllt‘t' Lommittee have as—
sured the Aiiiiiiiii ‘ that
tile State of New York is opposed to
erecting residence halls for its teaciicr
traiiiiiiU institutions. Therefore any
property purchased by the Alumni
Association for this purpose will he-
loiig to the association, and resnleiice

‘ wliicii may he erected by the
ociation will he lmder its manage-
ment, for the benefit of students of
both the summer and winter 5 ..ioiis.

The movement has the endorse-
ment of the former Coiliinissionc‘lz.
Dr. Finley and Dr. lime 'in. and of
the present Commissioner, Dr.
Graves.

When a pluti‘VL‘. card comes to you,
give or pledge as much as you can.
if money and pledges enough arc sc~
cured to consummate a purcht o
the ( .tl property. there will be, in
all likelihood, residence for a bun-
dred or more students available for
next summer.

Cards and money may be deposited
in the main hall in a box provided
for the purpose, or left in the Alumni
Association oflicc, Room No. 10 .

DR. PATTON SPEAKS TO IM-
MIGRATION CLASS

An interested group gathered to
hear Dr. ’atton's talk Thursday at-
ternoon. He gave it brief history of
the State Department of Labor, which
was organized in 1883. Progressive
steps in the development of the de-
partment were taken in 1886. 190],
1916 and 192], wiieii, with other ad-
ditions. a hireau of liiimigration
was added.

Some of the work which the La-
bor Department is responsible for is
making reports of labor conditions.
of the State Insurance fund. of the
linrean of Employment, o'f the Bu-
reau of the industrial Code. This
department also makes out the rules
and regulations for the safety of
machinery, and has connected with it
a Ilnreaii of Women in industry.

Practically all occupations are cov—
ered by the compensation law. The
exceptions to this are farm labor and
domestic service, both of which Dr.
i’attoii feels should be included. Did
you know that if four people in man-
ual labor or factory work in a firm.
the people in that lirni come under
the compensation law?

Did you know that if a person in
a firm was injured his employer must
report the injury to the ilep.’n'tinent
of Labor, also the employc must re-
port to his employer and to the lle»
partment of Labor?

These and many more interesting
facts w ic told its by llr. l'atlon. and
at the close of the hour time was
given for questions.

 

MY IMPRESSIONS OF STATE
COLLEGE

\\’iien Ellen Terry, yielding to a
sieg of iinporttintics, had finally
rim. iited to write the story of her
long and eventful life, she paused
in dazed ‘ wondering

    

irresnlntion.
where and how she should begin
ifrom this state of utter loss and
bewilderment, site was rescued by
the matter»of-fact advice of one of
her friends, “Iii-gin with the first
thing you remember," and her
autobiography roiniiieiiccs. “The
first thing i remember—"

The first thing i remenvber when,
for the first time. I saw State Col-
lege on the morning of July
tenth. was the thought, “What a
beautiful building. how well placed;
what a smooth and well—kept lawn.
and what a clear blue sky!" The
buildings of State College, with
their clean and simple lines, their
many windows. and their spacious
rooms, stig.r .ted that here work
would he a joy even if it were hot!
lfor i had been told that .\|bany
was hot! lint. despite catumiiiation
the weather man has proved otir
friend, the kiy auto trips would
seem the . .ai province of Hal-
cyone, and the sun shines even
when it rains!

lint almost. if not quite, at the
beginning come the sttidciil., inter-
estingly varied, to be sure, in age
and sex and costiiiiii: aml cl; ft'ure.
of varying purposes and desires,
experiences and ambitious; but
alike, all, in courtesy and friendli-
ness, response and appre tion.
On Friday of tiic ﬁrst week the
Faculty became apparent, on the
succeeding Friday. they were dis
tinctly visible. and there ' every
reason to beli-ve they will iemain
above the horizon to the end, and
that by the eighteenth of August,
their luminosity will have so pene-
trated the dark spaces that the end
of a happy “ may not prove
the end of a sorrmviiig student.

SUCCESSFUL SUMMER FOR
COLLEGE CAFETERIA

lf number of patrons. signifies
popularity. certainly State Loiiegc
Cafeteria is a popular place to eat.

The summer of 1921 was the first
time that the cafeteria had been open
for the convenience of summer ses
sion students. We felt it would meet
a need, and not only for the noon
luncheon, but for breakfast and sup-
per as well—so three meals daily
were served last summer. During
1921 summer school over 5000 meals
were served. This year will show a
decided increase Over last. An aver—
age of 3C0 meals are Served da.iy,
cscludinv Saturday and Sunday. _

The cafeteria is not run as a proht-
makingr enterprise. it is our purpose
to serve at a minimum cost the best
of food, wholesomely and properly
prepared. Any surplus money is ex-
pended for the purchase of new or
better erinipnienl.

"‘hc cafeteria is directly under the
management of the Home l'iconrmics
Denar‘ineiit of State College. Here
the Home Economics students re-
ceive their trainingr in cafeteria and
institutional management.

The management wishes to express
its appreciation of the splendid man-
ner in which the students have co-
operated in making the summer of
1922 a banner year for State College
tafeteria.
