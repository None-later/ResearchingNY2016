only two can listen? In music there
are three things for which to listen.
nationality. form, and expression."
To illustrate these characteristics.
two records \verc played—one from
a Scotch composer, the other an In-
dian love song. The composer must
have in mind a deﬁnite outline of his
selection; his phrases must balance.
The pupil gets an idea of musical

form as the record is played.

American music has its origin in
Indian and negro songs. In the
negro music we tind rhythm. melody
and harmony. The constant repeti—
tion in negro music often thecomcs
monotonous. However, this difficulty
may be overcome by bringing to-
gelhcr phrases showing light and
shade. as has been done in "Deep
River."

In the overcrowded curriculum of
the public school more attention
needs to he given coordination. Why
not coordinate music and composi-
tion. After hearing “ The Swan
Song ” a child of the sixth grade can
give you a written composition on
his reactions. Tone poems will stimu-
late imagination. Hence the pupils
cencenlrate on a piece as it is played.
then ask how many times a certain
designated phrase is repeated. lioys
and girls of the upper grades will
watch for tone colors.

The realm of music is one of the
most beautiful things in this world.
Music didn‘t just happen; it is the
result of growth. We want to listen
to it as a beautiful whole. Don't
listen from the intellectual lull front
the emotional standpoint.

were held every two weeks. There
were special hooks written for each
grade. To pass from grade to grade
the followinc standards were re-
quired: Reading, 80 per cent.; spell-
ing, 80 per cent.; writing, 70 per cent.
In the tirst grade the men were
taught to read simple sentences.
(iradually the complexity of the sen-
tences increased until in the filth and
sixth grades biographies were read.
Many immigrants found consolation
in the fact that Americans them-
selves were descendants of Euro-
peans, and that the Indians were the

only Americans.

In addition to their school activi-
ties the men cnioyed community sing-
ing twice a week. “ Movies” were
provided ior their entertainment.
There was an opportunity for them
to purchase ice cream, cigarettes, pic,
candy. etc. Each day a library was
open. where a teacher read to them.
assisted them in writing.r a letter home.
or played Ltamcs with them.

The It. Ii. C. has been discontinued
on account of the immigration law
and the army regulation which pro<
hibits illitera:es from military service.
