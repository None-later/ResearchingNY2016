INFORMATION ON THE
NEAR EAST RELIEF
Dr. A. C. McCrea.

.\ small but very interested
group gathered on Tuesday eve-
ning and listened to a splendid lec—
ture by [)r. :\, C. McCrea, of the
Near lCast Relief. McCrea
talked of his experie in the
'[‘rauscaucasian republics. where
famine conditions have been rant-
pant since the war. As the guest of
the Itolshevik govermnent', |)r. Mc-
Crea had an opportunity to ob-
serve the misery of the. unfortunate
people of "illis, l“. i n and .'\lex-
andropol, and ltad share in re-
lieving their distr '
tion of life in th' t. cit

skeleton bodies. thot
refugees throng the. cit
they hope to obtain help. llut

there is no help in the cities, for
there, is no sanitation, no water
system, not even a light at night.

Despite these awftll conditions.
Dr. McCrea believes that there isa
better fntttre in store for these peo-
ple, especially if America cou-
tinues to help them dttring the
time in wltich they are evolving a
democratic form of government.
They are done with czars and are
suffering what every nation suffers
after a mighty revolution.

After the lecture, a moving pic-
ture, Alice in llungerlan'l, was
shown. The picture added to what
Dr. McCrea had already said, and
gave an e. ' llent idea of the work
accomplished by the Near East
Relief in the operation of feeding
stations, hosnitas, and orphanages
where a million unfortunates have
been cared for. "here are s'ill

FOURTH ORGAN RECITAL
OF THE SERIES BY MR.
CANDLYN
l’rof. Caudlyn gave. the fourth of

his series of organ recitals on Au-

gust 9.

The program was as follows:
1. Grand Choeur |)ialogue......
(iigout.
liugene Gigoul is organist at St.

Aug‘ttstiu's, Paris. This “Dialogue”
was written for ttse at St. Augus-
tin's, where, as in most French
churches, there are. two organs. In
this e. and contrary to custom,
these organs are connected, so that
the "Dialogue" produces a strik-
ing effect.

2. Chanson. . . 

3. Festival Toccata . .. .Fletcher

4. The Angelus . .. ....Massenet
:\ popular number iIt which the

organ chimes are. freely used.

5. (a) l‘astorale

These two movements represent

(iuihuant at his best, although the

Iiinale is sometimes conventional

in the type of passage work em-

ployed
(at is a typical example of the

French school. The middle section

is hymn-lin in character. with

figures from the first theme inter"

DR. WHEELOCK TALKS ON
JUNIOR HIGH SCHOOL

Dr. Charles F. \Nheelock, assist-
ant commissioner of education,
spoke to the principals and superin—
tends last Wednesday evening on
” The Junior High School." Ac-
cording to Dr. VVheelock, there are
three essentials; opportunities for
varied minds, groups. its seventh,
eighth, and ninth class in one room
for administration. and advances
are made by subject and not by
grade; which is still an oppor-
tunitv. and not yet an achievement.

“Rochester and Detroit have al—
most perfected their junior high
school systems. but according to
renorts received in my office, those
of Detroit are not the kind wanted
in New York State." declared Dr.
Wlteeloek. “since they try to en-
tertain and amuse the student too
much in their subjects and make it
too easygoing for the pupils them—

APPRECIATIVE AUDIENCE
ATTEND READINGS

Last lfriday evening's entertain-
ment under the able direction of

tunity for displaying their highly
developed dramatic capabilities.

SIGHT-SEEING ON THE MO-
HAWK TRAIL

Saturday morning, August 5.
dawned clear and warm‘, much to
the surprise of those’who had
planned to spending the day by
seeing the sights the historic
Mohawk Trail had to offer. Two
large bus loads left the college
promptly at nine o'clock, as bright
and gay as the day itself. The
party cro..ed the Hudson, went
through Rensselaer to 'l'ittsfield
and from there to North Adams.
That ride was wonderful, but
manv little knew what was in store
for them at “Whitcomb’s Summit."
They stopped at the foot of the
“Trail” to eat lunch in the large
shady lawn of some. very accom-
modating people, who served coffee
for the party.

Then began the long climb to the
highest point on the trail. The
first stop was at the famous "flair—
pin Turn," where. such exclamatious
as; “ How long would it take to
drop down there?" " How far you
can see!" “\‘Vlmt a wonderful
view!" and “It make me faint to
look down here!” were heard from
the top of the tower. z\fter re—
freshing themselves with cold
drinks and ice cream, and buying
some souvenirs. the party again
started heavenv'ard, in this case
prices rose as they proceeded to—
ward leaveu, for at the next stop:
“Western Summit,” ten cents was
charged to go up in the tower.
From that tower three states and
seven lakes could be seen. Mount
Gt‘evlock, 3,605 feet high. loomed
up high above the opposite horizon.
But still the too had not been
reached. Front “\h’hitcomh’s Sum-
mit," the highest point. both sides
of the. mountain can be seen.
