APPRECIATION
The NeWs Board wishes to
thank the members of the faculty
and those students of the summer
session who have so kindly acted
as reporters or voluntarily con-
tributed articles to the ollege
News. We r‘alize that the sum-
mer session means a busy season
for, the majority of us, and in View
of this fact, we appreciate your ef-
forts all the more. We feel that
we should especially acknowledge
the services of:
iss Janet Anthony, Helen Fill-
ley, Elsie Kenney, Mildred lilcnis,
Agnes Smith, Ruth Kimmcy, Miss
Marie Weedon, Mr. Hcth C'.
Coons.

OUR FINAL WORD

if the events of summer school,
both pleasant and scholastic, have
not entirely ﬁlled your minds, you
Will remember that six weeks ago
we told you of the opportunities
that could be realized. As the
weeks have raced by. we have met
time after time, both in class and
out of class. There have been the
entertainments and parties every
l'riday evening to refresh the
brain, worn out by a week's hard
work. The Saturday trips have
done their hit to straighten out the
kinks produced by overwork in
stuffy libraries. Everytime that
the sociability urge came along
there was the big opportunity to
make friends.

. ow, when it is time for the col-
lege doors to close after the sixth
summer session, we feel that we
must say something appropriate to
the occasion. We could say good-
bye and get quite sentimental. lint
we are not going to.

’Wc hope that this summer ses-
siou has meant much to you both
mentally and socially. Some peo-
ple have hold themselves aloof.
For them we are sorry. Others
have shown that even the most
hard boiled school teacher can be
human when he is among friends.

'c hope that you will carry this
friendly spirit with you when you
go home. State College will mean
so much more to you when it is
peopled with pleasant memories.

. e hope that yoti have enjoyed
this summer session so much that
you will come again. We have en-
ioyed your friendly spirit of inter-
est. ft is our hope that we have
in. some way at least pleased you
with our publication. if this is the
case. then we will rest peacefullv
in the hope that we will see you
again.

 

 

STATE COLLEGE NEWS. AUGUST l5. l922

THE DIRECTOR'S AU REVOIR

Several days ago a. representa-
tive of the“ News ” came to the di-
rector’s office to inform him that
it was customary for the director
of the summer sion to write an
epitaph for the last number of this
summer’s " News’ before it and
the. summer school “ passed down
into history.” This seemed at first
a very simple matter. The di-
rector thought that all this implied
was the writing of some such
phrase as, “The end of a perfect
over his signature. The
writer of the paragraph in last

:n
r:

 

week’s “ News," describing ilie trip ‘

to liidian Ladder, “ beat him to it,"
and appropriated this expression.
To praise the summer session was
also out of the question, because it
might smack a bit too strong of
Aeneas” modest description of the
fall of Troy: “Quartim reruni
niagna pars lini." Yet there is cer-
tainly a place for praise in iliis final
greeting of the director to the
facility and students of the summer
session of 1922.

There has been a splendid spirit
of co-opei‘atiou manifested iy
faculty and students, which has
lightened the duties of the director
and made his work pleasant. Re—
quests from his office have been
quickly and cout’tcoiisly cur 'ed out
and regulations piinctiliously ob-
served. [for this he thanks
faculty and students. it certainly
has created “a genial spirit which
makes his work eay." llc feel.
too. that the Students Couiuiitte
who have arranged so many de-
lightful excursions and iuade nur
Friday evenings so enjoyable,
merit the especial thanks of the en-
tire faculty auil student body.

In closing the director hopes that
every student in the summer s
sioii will return home with a [)lL s-
ant impression of State College
lingering in his memory. llc trusts
that in spite of credits earned or
lost, each student Iuav take with
him the eager and persistent desire
to learn more about some one
branch of burning. If he has this
love of learning in his heart. the
summer session will have done
more for his future success as an
inspiring teacher than it could do
in any other way. This. then, is
the director's "an revoir."

PLEDGE FOR THE DORMI-
TORY FUND

Students are asking the why and
the wherefore of the pink cards
that were distributed on Thursday,
August 10. We are askingr the en-
rolled studonts of summer school
as well as the regular students to
contribute toward the dormitory
fund which has been constantly
irrowing under the supervision of
the Alumni with the comperat’on
of the students.

Many of the people who are in
it‘tcndaiice at the session this stim-
mer, have been here previous years,
and many of the people who are
here this summer anticipate rc'urn-
ing for future sessions. Now we
hope that voti feel thai you belong
to State College. indeed. we hope
that you have such a strong iii-
eliiiation for the institution, that
you will want to express that feel‘
incr in a substantial way and con-
fribtite toward the fund for build
ing dorms.

'ow please do not argue that
the dormitories are of benefit to
students of the regular session but

st sion, has supervised recreation
in such an efficient manner as to
matt'ially add to the success of

Sight-Seeing on the Mohawk Trail

(Continued from page 1)

Many pictures were taken from
there.

After everyone had enjoyed the
sights of the Trail, the party
started home by the way of llen~
niugton and Troy. When they
reached lcnningfon, everyone
wished to climb the monument
marking the battlefield where John
Stark made the liritish retreat.
This monument is among the
highest in the world.

When the tired. but satisfied
bunch finally arrived at State Col-
lege, even though the party was
four hours later than was
pected. everyone felt that
money had been well spent.

REPORT CARDS

The envelopes that contain re-
port cards are always opened With
an attendant anxious feeling, but
still very few of 115 would m‘ss the
opportunity to land our successes
and lament our failures. Therefore
if you wish your report card sent
to your home, please leave a
stamped envelope in the Registrar's
office. The envelopes of regulation
size, may be purchased at the
Co-op.

needs of students and compare such

dition of roomingr houses \'Vc

jure up in your imagination a dorm
which your money has helped to
build, you will be willing to con-

tribute toward the good cause,
even though your con‘ribntion

may be small. lliif_lct our motto
be: ‘ “l‘ile the Pennies," for dorms
at State College.
