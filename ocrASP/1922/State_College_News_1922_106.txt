No. 3—The Historical and Art
Institute
There is only one more week of
summer school left-30 let its make
the most of the short time that is
allotted us. Perhaps you have al-
r :ady visited the Capitol and the
Education building‘ but. if you
have, let that he an added incentive
to explore the l’listorical and Art
institute which is on Washington
Avenue, above the Education build-

ing.

Here. you may gaze at the old
mahogany clock that used to hang
in the old Capitol and wonder if
the pendulum is cut glass or just
plaitt glass, or you may look in the
wonderful mirrors in the main hall
and lament the fact that yottr
rooming house affords no such
marvelous looking gl' s.

It yott are in a romantic mood,
there is the wedding dress of the
Flapper of 1775, who wore such
extreme high heels and had such
tiny feet and whose gown was so
lavishly embroidered and whose
skirt was so long and full.

And if yott ever had a fancy for
tans, here is the opportunity for
indulging aforesaid fancy. There
are wonderful, carved ivory fans,
or Japanese fans, or silk fans, or
in fact. most any kind of fans.

Then too, there are the huge
locks and keys which were for-
merly used on forts in Albany. and
we are immediately glad that \\'e
do not have to attach such cum-
hrous keys to ottr keyringswal-
though we admit that there is one
advantage. because with a key of
that ‘ we would not be liable to
loss it as often as we are accus-
tomed to misplace our house, lab.
and locker keys.

"here are mammoth cantile-
sticks which remind us of the
piano lamps of to-day, and there
are the cradles in which the good
old mothers of New Amsterdam
rocked their babies to sleep.

' here are displays of silver,
jewelry, chinaware and pewter,
that would please the heart of the
most fastidious examiner, and. i
you are blessed with an historical
turn of mint]. you may view the
pictures of all the ex-prcsidents of
the United States in the lecture
hall of the Institute, and hesidc
each picture lt~ the original hand-
writing of the ex-president.

Last but not' least, it is rumored
that among the many \vontlcrs oi
the second tioor are some real
mummies. l started to use the ex-
pression " real live," but I guess
that tl‘c mummies are far from
alive.

“There is altogether too tnuch
teaching being done in our schools

The consciousness of the pupil of
his own personal power has not
been developed and not tttttil this
is done will our schools come up
to the proper standard of edu-

guided too far in their work. This
must stop.

“Special emphasis should be laid
upon the teaching of general
science in the junior hiin school.
So far this course in the senior
high schools has not been henc-

been crammed to the extent that it
exceeds the mental capacity of the
average fourteen year old pupil.

” In the junior high school this
subject should he taught for a
three year course. being given in
the seventh, eighth and ninth
grades. in this way a more speciﬁc

would have a greater knowledge of
science rather than more infor-
