. THE LITERACY TEST

Tuesday, August 8, at 1:30, Mr.
Alfred E. Rejall, of the State De—
partment of Education, spoke to
the Immigrant Education class on
the new literacy test law passed by
the last legislature, which affects
all who vote this fall for the first
time in New York.

The law itself is in two parts.
The lirst provides for testing the
ability of the applicant to read and
write English, on registration day.
The Secretary of State in accord-
ance with the law, has prepared one
hundred extracts from the New
York State Constitution, approxi-
mately ﬁfty words each. These are
to be printed by each district "on
uniform pasteboard slips in double
small pica type and the slips shall
be kept by the inspectors in a. box
so constructed as to conceal the
slips from view.” The voter shall
draw out one of these slips at ran-
dom and read aloud intelligently
the extract found there. The in—
spcctor then selects ten words from
the extract for the voter to write.
The slip is then returned to the
box and the contents shaken up by
an inspector.

There is another method pro-
vided to determine the literacy
qualification. The new voter may
present a certiﬁcate of literacy
si med by the principal of a public
sciiool recognized by the State De-
partment. This certifies that
the voter can read and write Eng-
lish and that the signature appear—
ing on the certilicate was made in
tile presence of the principal. The
voter presenting such a certilicatc
will he required to make his sig-
nature in the presence of the in—
spectors. If it corresponds to the
other on the certificate he is not
required to take the Secretary of
State's test unless an inspector de-
mands it. The last sentence pro-
vides that “The board of regents
of the University of the State of
New York may adopt and enforce
rules governing the issuance and
further authentilication of such cer-
tilicatcs of literacy and the prepa-
ration and examination of appli—
cants therefore."

Mr. itcjall is chairman of the
committee that has been devising
the test to be given by the Regents.
The latest principles of psychology
have been followed in trying to de-
visc the best possible scheme.

The standard set was that of the
ability of a child just completing
the fourth grade. The tests have
been tried out in several cities. The
committee chose seven topics on
which to base their selections for
testing. These topics are (1)
America; (2) Americanization; (3)
America's History and Govern—
ment; ('4) Citizenship and Naturali-
zation; (5) Civic Duties. Virtues.
and institutions; (6) industries
and Occupations: (7) international
Relationships. Ninety-three con-
crete types have been chosen based
on the seven major topics. A par-
agraph is written on some of these
topics, Questions are formulated
on the paragraph. Six. of these par-
agraphs have been chosen for the
examination to be given this year
du_ring the week of October 2. The
principal or superintendent in each
district will decide as to the details

of time and place. The applicant is '

given very clear instructions before
beginning. The idea of this test is a
reading —— writing —— comprehen-
sion test. He is to answer the
questions in writing and as briefly
as possible.

The examiners have very definite

instructions about marking the
papers. I‘Iach person taking the
test will receive either the certifi-
cate literacy or a card saying he
has failed to pass the test but is not
dcbarred from taking the Secretary
of State's test at the polls.

The purpose of the law is a very
commendable one. it is impossible
to say how the law. as it now ex-
ists. will work. Mr. ltejall tried to
impress upon everyone the need
for co-opcralion and suggestions
for improvement. There may be
several loopholes for abusing the
law. and if so it will have to be
amended.
