ALL ABOARD, 1926

Fresh, we are glad to see you. As
you are the newest class in college. you

 

'DR. BRUBACHER WELCOMES
FRESHMEN

l gladly accept this opportunity of-
fered by the State College News to
say a word of welcome to the l’resh-
urn. You enter a splendid company
*if earnest young people who are en-
gaged in the absorbing quest for
truth and wisdom. You come into a
place devoted to work and dedicated
to the highest things in life—knowl-
edge, culture, friends. [ hope you
will lay hold on these high things and
prepare yourselves for the great sar—
vicc which is before you in life. You
will go out as teachers later, teachers
in a new world. There you will need
the most accurate knowledge of
which you are capable; you will need
‘be broadest and deepest culture; you
will find friends a source of pleasure
‘llttl comfort. The diligent college
nan and woman has here a miniature
vorld in which to prepare for the
larger world beyond. 1 hope the
t..‘lass of l926 will test the capacity of
State College as a source of im
spiration, as a place of prepartiou, as
a place of great beginnings l wel-
come you to State College.

 

WANT HELP?
See Dean Pierce
Duringr these trying first days of

college, the otlice of the Dean of
Women is a good place to go to for
advice and counsel, especially if you
are a freshman who feels a bit
strange in this new place of hustling,
bustling people.

It will help Dean Pierce very‘ much
if each freshman will write his or her
name and city address on a slip of
paper and leave it at her ofﬁce as
soon as possible. This is an impor-
tant matter as very often calls from
home or other almost as urgent mat-
ters come in. These might be
straightened out much more quickly
and easily if this information were at
hand. Any freshman who feels she
is not happily located, should see
Dean Pierce at once regarding any
change, since no one may change her
boarding house after this week with-
out a consultation in the office of the
Dean of Women.

Beginning next week. Dean Pierce
will meet the freshmen once each
week in an open conference at which
further suggestions for adapting one-
self to new work and new homes, will
be made,

llean l’ierce is in her office every
morningr from 9:30 to 12:00, and
everv freshman owes it to herself to
avail herself of Miss l‘ierce’s advice
and friendship—~takc it from. one who
knows!

 

DEAN HORNER TO 1926

There are fifty hopeful faces in the
line at my ofﬁce door and the Editor
of the " News ” breaks in to remind
me of my promise, now three weeks
old, to say a word of greeting to the
new students in his Iirst issue. You
can see, Freshmen. how earnestly
anxious we are to help you here at
State College, l greet you with the
suggestion that you should not put,
of? any task which confronts you in
these new and interesting days until
to-morrow. Do it today! The false
start in college seems to me respon-
sible for ner disaster than any one
other thing. Sometimes failure is due
to lack of brains, sometimes to over-
work, sometimes to poor health, but
more often to dilly-dallying and l)ll'~
ting 0 until to—morrow what should
clearly be done to-day. And so the
Editor of the "News" has made a
horrible ample of Inc just by way
of expres. ng the hope of State Col-
lege that you will really begin your
work in earnest at the beginning.
There is a good time waiting around
the corner for you. it may even hap—
pen that the happiest days of your
lives will be spent here. That's all
possible, coupled with hard work and
persistent and constant attention to
the business that brings you to col—
lege. You have the best credentials
of any class that has ever entered this
institution. That means we shall ex-
pect much of you to-day. Cordial
greetings and all good wishes.

 

   
  

 

 

 

 

are also the largest one. As such, you
will have a big part to perform. You
will find that there is a place for you in
the life at college. In that place you
will find plenty of work and plenty of
fun.

You will not have to rtm the college,
neither will you be expected to. Leave
that to the Sophs and let them try to
do it. it sometimes happens that a
freshman at college fails to forget that
he was a high school senior last year.
So he starts in with a “high and
mighty " attitude. He soon comes to
grief, however, when he ﬁnds that it
doesn’t work. No one else realizes his
bigness, and the disappointment makes
him hermitlikc as he withdraws from
the association of his fellows. Such
instances are becoming rarer, however,
as the modern young person does not
ordinarily feel an overbearing sense of
his own importance.

When you come to State you will find
evcrrone friendly and kind to you. if
