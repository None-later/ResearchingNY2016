NEWS FOR THE FROSH i

When you tirst opened the door of
college this fall wasn‘t the tirst words
you heard. “ Have yoti seen —-———
my ft‘cslttttatt sister." llut long be
fore now every junior has met his or
her freshman sister or brother aml
most all of the 303 members of 1926
have been escorted and introduced
and sting In. First it was registration,
then the Faculty Reception, then the
sing on Saturday afternoon and the
Vesper service Sunday. lot are the
intiiors through yet? Not at all.
'l'hey may cv i help out the soplts a

 

bit by advising that the Freshman
Handbook be read more thoroughly.

.‘\nd haven‘t you noticed the way the
ittniors smile when the words " fresh-
man," and “ party," and "last of ()c«
tobci' " are iiictttioticd? if you haven't

just mention them and see. it may
be that the juniors are planning
something nice to makc up for the

sophomore get-wise meeting.

MEMOIRS OF SUMMER SCHOOL

So often we think of memoirs as
connected with events that belong to
the coiiipar.’itirely dead past btit
little connected with the fiittirc. lllll
the memoirs of summer school is a
living. vital record. lict‘attsc the stutt-
tll(’t' school is a growing institution
with an enrollment that increases
.-vcry recurring year. ltoartls of edu-
ratio” are beginning to see the iii-ces-
sin of hiring up to date teachers and
’lt'L' willing to defray a fraction oi the
cxpcii' of the members of their
faculti s who attend the summer
session or are willing to increase the
salary of teachers who spend a protit,-'
able summer in an educational insti-
tntion.

Fxpcriettced teachers are not in a
class by theniSi-lvt's when it comes to

 

 

 

a recognition of the value of summer
work. lx’egiilarly matriculated college
students are lint-king to summer
school. l‘erliaps. it is the ambition to
takc a few extra courses or the aim
to tinish college in a shorter period
then the required term, or it may lie
the painfttl necessity of iitakitig up
lltinked hours.

We are especially proud of our own
summer session. .\ majority of the
departments of the regular session
are represented. We have a student
organization which provides enter-
tainments for Friday evenings and
plans trips for the Saturdays. This
summer the Music and English dc-
nartmctits were right there when it
came to amusing the students, Then
there was the organization of the
School Superintendents and Wind-
pals which held its weekly meetings
and provided interesting speakers, and
for the second summer otir college
paper has been issued.

We feel that a gr fill deal is to bc

, ing.

SILVER BAY MEETING

ium, there will be a Silver llay meet-

snapshots taken at Silver llay, these

plained by Winifred Dunn. livery
one is cordially invited.
LIBRARY NOTICE

copies of tin-.bonks for which there is
the greatest demand. Since it will be

of their exp ice and kindne. and
there does seem to be an iiideliiiablc
<ntlltfllllllg that attracts the teachers
to the pupils—perhaps it is the, bony-
ant spirit of youth for as one man
said. "The works of man are never
so beautiful as when they are falling
to decay; the works of God are most
beautiful when they are young.”
While there are a few who both
tottsciottsly or unconsciously do their
best to discourage students from
teaching, we always meet many who

   

 

 

gained by the aSsociation of teachers
and college students. The students
are attracted to tile teachers becattst‘

make us more than glad that we are
training for the profession which we
l‘ave chosen.
