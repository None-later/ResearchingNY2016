ideas go. In the ﬁrst place, there was
:nough red-hot romance in a walk,
knapsack on back, over 200 miles of
old anti historic country, td start any-
Jody's head to jigging and to make
myiwdy's heart do nose-dives and
jail spins, And both of our hearts

To proceed. We worked a whole
ivening planning a route. We studied
he map of Massachusetts until we
:ould rcci‘te it backwards and both
vays from the middle. We had a six
lard list of places that we planned to
isit. Outlits, knapsaeks, camp cook-
ng—we lived in atmospheres of them
or days. We even dreamed about
cm at night. I used to have a favor-
te nightmare in which a pair of khaki
valking l)l‘(:c(‘llCS chased me down an
ndlcss road carpeted with aluminum
rying pans, That was the way of
