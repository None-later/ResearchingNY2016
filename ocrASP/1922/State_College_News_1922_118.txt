a national authority on football and
a referee of note. gave a most inter-
esting talk on the American College
game. Besides being an expert's
opinion on football. it also was a
masterpiece of description. l‘rof. [tis-

well as a historian and athlete. His
versatility of expression madet a great
hit with the frosli. History 2 people
and ineideutly with everyone else.

Dr. llrubaeher was next introduced.
He expressed the ambilioiis of the
faculty’ in hoping that Slate's prowess

as the best known member of the
faculty. He took up the athletic pos-

gentle hint to get out by turning otit

what a splendid reception it was!

everybody enjoyed eyeryboily else—~—
so how rould t‘l affair help but be a
bowling success!

greet Dean l’iercc and a few smiling
members of the faculty. The rest ot
