RESOLUTIONS

The opening of the college year, like
the lirst of January, is characterized by
a host of good resolutions. lint collegi-
ate resolutions are formed as a result of
previous experience and a certain
amount of earnest thought, whereas
New Year's resolutiolts are often a con-
sequence of watching the old year out
and the new year in. Resolutions that
are as serious as our collegiate reforms
should consequently last longer and
show greater results than the “new
leaf" of the new year. When we say
that we intend to keep our work caught
,up this year let us at least not leave the
first week's work—just because it is
easy— until the following week. When
a junior says that he intends to be a
real friend to his fresh sister or brother,
let him not forget this injunction, al-
though his tasks are many and heavy.
And when the sophs say that they in—
tend to chastise the fresh let it not be
an idle boast whose vagueness of pur—
pose will he seen long before Moving-
np Day. So let us each and everyone

make our resolutions—few or many as
we choose—hut let us stick to them like
a fly to molasses,

 

 

 

 

 

MYSKANIA

At the receptions lately, when timid
freslnnen have pointed out an attrac-
tive senior and asked their junior sis—
ters, " Who is that?H they have been
baffled by the reply, “W'lty, that's
Grace liox; she‘s on Myskania." ()I‘
when they come running back to a
waiting junior to proclaim “I just
met itetty Renner; isn’t she nice?"
they hear again, "Of course she is;
she's on Myskania." in the hall they
hear vague comments—“ Dot has a
new chain for her Myskania key,H or
“There goes May Wood—Myskania

member.” And naturally the fresh-
mcn wonder just what Myskania
means.

Myskauia, dcar freshmen, is an hon-
orary body composed of not less than
eleven and not more than thirteen
seniors chosen annually for high
scholarship, leadership, college spirit,
anti general pnpttlnt‘ily. From the day
they enter college these students have
stood out for sincere effort in raising
the standards of State College in any
antl every way. On .\loving-np Day,
when juniors become seniors, the new
Myskania is chosen from the new senior
class. It is one of our highest rites. and
everyone sits very tense and still while
the old Mvskania members, one by one,
choose their successors. And when
Myskania has been chosen, it becomes a
great and quietly active power in our
college world. No one, perhaps, ,‘ s
its influence directly. but one always
feels it when eager scholarship rises;
when athletics, sports. and social events
stand out Intrticularly line, clean, and
happy: when college publications be—
come truly literary; and when the spirit
of sincere friendliness is most evident.

Sometimes Myskania appears in as-
sembly, arrayed on the nlatfonn in cap
anti ﬂown. with the .\lyskania key, sym~
bol of the honor due, gleaming against
the black gown. And when they appear
so before us we realize most deeply the
extent of their silent influence. We
like to see them there. We would like
to see them there every Friday morn-
ing. Why not? Let's ask them to come
in cap and gown and sit on the plat—
form every week this year.

speed, less hair.
