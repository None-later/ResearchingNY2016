from the first game to the last a

only describe as listlessnes. although
it was something less tangible than
that: a failure, rather, to give the '
ounce, to light for the last inch, which
was and still is an absolute necessuy
for a winning football team. .

I have become convinced that it
is a stark impossibility to develop a

SILVER BAY
’Continued from page I)

llreakfast over, we went to the
chapel for morning Worship. the most
beatitifiil service of the whole day.
You can begin to appreciate it when
you hear that one girl said she loved
to sit in the gallery for she could
fairly see the prayers mounting
lieavrnivard like smoke.

After cltapel we had discussion
groups followed by other meetings of
various types. and tlieu dinner. The
dining liall was furnished with round
tables jest b’g enough for four: and
usually two of us would bunt around
tttitil we found two girls front some
other college with whom we Would
eat. thus making many acquaintances
and hearing the ueus of other
—rliools.

boating and tennis and swimming.

which was always a welcome time.
for exer ' will put edge on appetite.

 

'l‘hen came an hour's sing in the
apt”. S’x hundred girls formed a
hollow square. college banners were
llying and every college vieing with
all the others to see which had most
college spirit. State had it in abund-
ance, btit it was not easy to prove it

sang Silver lay song's, " l’nllmv the

:\nd the moon comes stealing near

o'er the silvery water,

We sing songs that cheer us.

We have. dear friends near us,

\Ve could see the moon rising over

the mountain tops and gilding the
calm smooth lake, and old Sunrise
Mountain outlined against the sky,

And we were fairly caught by the
spirit of Silver lay.

'l‘hcu \\L‘ [locked into the audito-
rium to hear some of the most able
speakers in .\meriea. The messages.
brought to the conference by Dr.
Collin and Dr, l1U$tilei both of New
York (by, were helpful and inspiring.

After the evening meeting we had
a delegation meeting in soincoue's

bedroom or on the roof under the

 

stars. llcrc lletty Reuner, our
“dele” leader, passed on any bits of
inforimition she had heard at "date"
lvaders‘ uteeting during the day,
while the rest of us consumed ginger
snaps aml cheese, iiabiscos, cheese
tidbits and any other edible tliiug we
could buy. borrow or steal, to stave
otT threatened starvation, Then, with
blessings on the man who invented
sleep, we sought rest either in the ap-

pointed rooius or on a slanting,
graiwl-envered roof and after some
hours dropped off to drcatnless
slumber.

The most unique event was the
dedication of a chapel in memory of
Helen Hughes, daughter of lion.
(‘harles III. Hughes. The chapel holds
only three hundred; so the girls who
could not gain entrance dressed in
White and formed an avenue through
which p used Secretary Hughes and
his family, the leaders of the confetu
L‘Itt‘e and the choir singing "All Hail
our King Eternal." It was certainly
a beautiful and iiupr ' ceremony
that will not soon from our
memory.

 

 

fade

There was a humorous side to our
trip as well as a seriotis side. imagine
planningr a party with your room-
males, only to find all the refresh-
ments, such appetizing things as
'ackers and more crackers, had been
broken up and sprinkled between the
sheets of your beds. Or picture, if
yoii can, two girls, one quite tall and
the other somewhat shorter, emerg-
ing from their room in one pair of
slippers attd one bat’hrobe and eti-
countering, not a mad bull, nor a
bear, nor even a stern-faced matron,
but a bilge night watchman with a
mammoth spotlight.

 

And then try to imagine the feel-
ings of fifteen weary girls anxious to
retire when they discovered. bed-
steads sans blankets, sans sheets,
sans pillows, in fact sans everything
but a mattress and a spread. Two of
our numbers had conﬁscated all our
comforts. lint—let me whisper it so
the unfecling culprits will not hear~
we had a better sleep that night than
on any other.

And so the (lays sped by, each one
richer and fuller than the day before,
until the last morning came, when we
discovered that there were so many
places we had mean-t to visit, so
many nooks that had become so dear
to us that we hated to leave them.
lot we comforted ourselves with the
hope that perhaps next year we may
all be permitted to go again to Silver
Bay, and we are hoping that we may
be permitted to take You witlt us.
