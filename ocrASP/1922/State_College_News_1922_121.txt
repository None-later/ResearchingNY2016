SPIRIT BEHIND THE ELEVEN
(Continued from page fl)

is not it would he a physical impos-
sibility to watch the menttbers of the
team to see if they are observing this
very simple bttt necessary rule.

It has been my experience that the
coach who turn- detectlve tones
most of his inﬂuence away. and no
coach can afford to forget that a
good football player means a pretty
good citizen, and that it is impossible
to develop the one without some in-
telligent effort to develop the other.

llut if the football coach has taken
t'he trouble to develop or started to
develop. the proper football spirit in
the institution. he will find that the
non-football players will do this work
for him; though in the vast majority
of instances it won't be necessary.
They will see to it that a football
player caught smoking becomes so
unpopular that once is enough, as far
as this' player is concerned.

Football is distinctly a game of
willing subordination of seltis'h
motive to the cause of the team.
which in reality personifics the school
or university behind it. And the
coach who does not realize it is mere-
ly inviting defeat for himself and his
team. iut once the proper spirit is
developed in the college, the job is
half done.

Don’t Overlook Unpromising Men

The task of stirring enthusiasm he-
hind a team during the playing sea-
son is a relatively simple affair if
gone about in the proper manner.
The excitement of the game itself
intakes it fairly easy to wake an tip-
roar of cheers and songs at mass
meetings and parades at practice
games and these all have their share
in producing the winning football
atmosphere. ‘

Sometimes I hear well-meaning
people-—-peoplc who know a little
about the surface of the game itself——
speak slightingly of this enthusiasm.

“Sideline and grandstand spirit"
they call it, and if it were true that
such an atmosphere bred a tendency
to take one‘s only exercise on the
bleachers i should agree with them,
in part at least. llut l have found it
strongly effective in exactly the op-
posite direction. The more the loot-
ball coach can arouse enthusiasm in
a man utterly unable to play the
game. the easier it becomes to
persuade that man to develop his
body and keep it in decent running
repair.

it certainly needs the right football
atmosphere to make the players real-
ize their obligation to themselves ant:
to their schools. This spirit. once
wakened. will bring out a squad of
candidates which includes every pos-
silvle niece of football timber.

lt is of the utmost importance that
every candidate who comes out for
the team be given a warm welcome.
and the coach should cc‘rtainly try to
put careful and special effort on those
showing little immediate promise.

desire for further information is what
makes for a life full of happiness and
service. And it is up to the scholars
of the present generation to solve the
problem of scholarship and happiness.

Ruth 'I‘eiTt made several announee-
meuts concerning the 1923 Peda-
gogue. Instead of individual pictures
of members of college organizations,
there will be group pictures of all
sororities, clubs, and associations.
(Professor Kirtland will take the
group pictures and Mr. Lorey will
take the individual pictures.) Groups
to have individual pictures are the
senior class. Myskania, Onuicrun Nu,
Finance Board. class presidents and
the oiliccrs of Student Association.

a ulcer and more amusing imperson-

were the well-known characteristics,
such as glancing over the eyeglasses
and the low whispers of the voice.
Mutt and Jeff followed on the pro-
gram—we gazed at Dr. l‘lastings.
played by Emily lleltling. and l’rol.
Kirlland. played by Mary Congtlon.
"hese two honored members of the
faculty proved to he most human and
entertaining in their musical dialogue.
Little did the fresh suspect the jolly
humor of our profs. And last but not
least. Priscilla .lones as one of our
janitresses with pail and broom in
hand hustled out on the stairs and
sputtered at us in angry. shrill voice.
Tints ended six reels of snappy fun.

During the remainder of the even-
ing we ate orange ice and danced.
When eleven o’clock struck. we did
not want to leave the hospitality of
Y. W.. but in this world “there is an
end to everything." and the best of
friends must part. so necessity forced
us to follow the 'homeward trail.
Some of the best players ever devel-
oped were drawn from this class of
candidates —- men who failed to make
prep school teams because of rela-
tively slow development, and who as.
freshmen or sophomores were still
well behind their mates in football
knowledge and experience.

Such men are sometimes slow to
take hold on the field. and the iirst
impulse of a coach. overwhelmed with
the distraction of trying to distinguish
between a hundred strange faces, is
to clarify his problem by eliminatng
them at once.

There could hardly be a more seri-
ous blunder. The experienced and
conﬁdent player is sure of himself.
while the beginner feels shy at the
best of it and needs encouragement.
not only for his own sake. but for the
effect on the rest of the squad and
the undergraduate body behind it.

No coach can afford to give any-
body a legitimate reason for feeling
slighted. Such grievances damage
the morale more effectively than any-
thing else.

Trying to pick an eleven on the
first day or in the ﬁrst week is im-

 

possible and unwise.
