'26 Guests of Honor

The Wmnen‘s Athletic Association
will hold the first gym frolic of the year
on Friday evening, October 20, at eight
o'clock. There will be stunts, games,
refreshments and dancing. livery metri-
her and every prospective member is iii-
vited to attend. It is customary to wear
bloomers and iniddies with class colors,
if possi ile. Freshmen girls are expected
to wear their hair down.

Point System

For the benefit of those students who
either have. never heard of or do not
understand the "point system " of our
Athletic /\ ociation, this is written.

Of course, every girl wants to win
class numerals, or college letters, or
both; so we must get to work right away
to earn them. For every hour of active
exercise, such as soccer, tennis, basket-
ball, baseball, hockey, horseback riding,
swimming, organized hikes, and iii the
winter, skating, skiing and snow—shoc-
iiig, we get one point. In order to ob-
tain credit for your hour it is necessary
to hand in your name and the number
of hours you are claiming credit for to
the captains of the different sports. '1‘
names of the captains will be posted on
the ti. A. A. btilletin hoard soon. Watch
for them!

In order to obtain class numerals one
must have fifty points; for college let-
ters, seventy. If one obtains the college
letters for three years, one gets as re-
ward a heavy, white slip-on sweater, a
gift'froin the G. A. A. Besides all the
above—mentioned rewards, there is one
more—the girl who wins the highest
number of points of all gets a beautiful
silvcr loving cup. Last year the cup
was given to Lela Cackner, of the Class
of ‘22. who attained the large number of
one hundred and eighty points.

Freshman initiated at
Noisy Party

Blue and White the Color Scheme
for Facial Decoration

On Friday night, October 6, the
sophomore class gave its “(jet-Wise
any to the great-in-nnmbcrs and un-
initiated class of 1926. This class has
been smilng about the halls, confident
in the knowledge that many of them llﬂt
not been identified yet as mere “ frosh.”
After the party, those who live to tell
the tale will still smile. but there will be
wisdom in the smile.

The sophs started off the evening's
entertainment with a bang. Instead of
leaving it to the frosh‘s honor as to
whether they should enter the front
door or not. soph guards kindly but
firmly directed thctn to the back one.
Then, several froin had to have their
hairpins removed by force, which proved
to be a highly interesting incident.

Yow the initiation started in force.
After being led about the building by
many devious routes, the new inmates
. . T. were brought to the gym.
Here those who were not too frightened
to remember gave their names to the
recording ofﬁcer and received in ex«
change a button of blue and white,
bearing the insignia ’26. Next, a gallant
sophomore caused them to swear fealty
to the class of '25. The water was wet
and seemed to be an entirely new liquid
0 sortie of the newcomers. After being
dried off, they were handed to the sign
painters. Some struggled, and the re-
sult wasAdisastrous. in rapid succes-
sion came the features of the evening
for each member of ’26. They tried out
the chute the chutes, the roller-coaster
the whirling chairs, twisting swings,
scissor grinders. the eatingr of pickled
bones, and, last but not least, the ghost
cliamier.

Of course, there is no question of the
courage of '26, but many things, humor-
ous to contemplate, occurred during the
evening. Several refused to eat bones,
and many came from the ghost chamber
with the fixed griinace of one who is

Frosh Seize Soph Banner

After repeated efforts at the “get
wise ” meeting of last Friday night to
get the soph's banner, the frosh finally
succeeded in gaining possession of it.
When the party broke up shortly after
eleven, the {rush gathered together their
forces outside the college to consider
matters. They did not know whether
the sophs would attempt to remove their
banner that night or leave it in a safe
place until an Opportunity presented it-
self to remove it from the danger of
re 'apture.

At any rate, they determined to get

that banner that night. After several
false alarms, when ‘26 thought that the
sophs uerc trying to smuggle out the
banner. the sophomores left the college
at about twelve o'clock, leaving the ban-
tier in the hands of Charles, who was to
put it in a safe place. in some myste«
rioits manner the frosh learned the. loca-
tion of this hiding place, and. after
Charles had departed, they started to
\\‘or'.
They removed the screen from the
window of the typewriting room and
raised the window, which was iiufas-
teued. liisidc, they forced open the door
of the closet in which the banner was
hidden and seized the banner.

Where the banner lies hidden, and
whether the banner will he recovered or
not, remain a mystery which only time
can unravel.
