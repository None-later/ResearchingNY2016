CLIFF HAVEN NOTES

[For those rnlh-ec freshmen him are
just beginning to be associated with
.\'ewiiiaii clubs, for upperclassmeu and
alumnae who not only wish to keep in
touch with proercss made, but also to
llt‘t‘tltlll' more aninia ed with true " New-
man spirit." tin-re is no better place to
en llian to the l‘.t'll 'atiou convention,
which is held at (Tlilf llaveii each year.
So many helpful SitLt‘Hcstiuns are gained
from the exchange of ideas that every
tlelceate upon leaving the convention
coiilidcully lllt forward to the most
ful year yet in the history of his
rt-s'ietlt 'c club.

(hie hie‘ factor which made this year's
convention such a lltl’ snc that
all formality was dispensed i tli. At
the “get together meeting," which was
held on the uieht of our arrival at Cli
ll:|\'t'l|, :uiuonncement was made that
everyone Would he expected to comply
with the morning custom at Cliff llavep
—~" Smile and say good-morning." Wha,t
better way cont have been devised tp
create at once a friendly atmosphere?

The convention was formally opened
on Monday, lulv 3. with a high mass.
[father ,\|ac.\|illan, the pastor of tile
church, urged the deleeales to avail
themselves of the many opportunities
both for spiritual and social recreation
and enjoyment. .

On Monday, also, occurred the open-
inu exercises of the Catholic Summer
School. which all as people from al
parts of the country to he. ‘ lectures of

the lectures g1 cii b Iiatlier llriihl, a
noted lecturer and wri'er, and by Father
Spaiildinc, who has written everal
books on Sociology in which he ably iii—
terprcts socioloc problems from the
Catholic viewpoint. . 1

Business nieetincs were conducted each
day after the morningy lectures and
aizain after lunch. There was much
