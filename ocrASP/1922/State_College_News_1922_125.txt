It was decided by a vote of the stu—
dent body that the balance on hand
from last year should he applied to the
present budget, thereby decreasing the
grand total. The budget as a whole
was then accented. The tax per student
cnmpulcd from the ﬁnal total was $11.78,
but, acting upon a suggestion that, as
the $11.78 was an ineolleetahle amount,
the individual tax be raised to an even
$12, the student body legalized its levy.
Thus the student tax for the year 1922-
25 is $12 per student.

Duringr the remainder of assembly
period we all enjoyed a jolly good sing.
conducted hy our college song leader,
l'ldna Shafer. Then we adjourned to
