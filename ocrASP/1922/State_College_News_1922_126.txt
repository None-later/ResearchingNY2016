was, "Authority in the State." He
defined democr cv as the form of gov—

the extreme necessity of making a
careful study of the relationship of
these two factors of popular govern~

Coach Snavely Working Hard With
Men

(in Saturday afternoon the 'Var-
sity football team will liltL'l the l\'()t‘li-
ester School of Optometry eleven on
the latter's gridiron. in spite of the.
opponents' greater experience, the
men are confident of a favorable ont-
C(llllt‘.

'l'he lx’ochestcr team is reported as
having its backfield intact from last
year and being very fast. The team
is light, however. They have been
playing football about three y'ars,
which is an advantage State does not
pos- s I'lowevet‘. State looks for-
' rd to giving them a hard battle.
('oach Snavely has been instructing
his men in new formations this week
and correcting the mistake shown up
in the Union game. If the squad
works hard this week, the outlook is
bright fora good game.

.\ ntnnber of students are planning
to accompany the team. Only a haml-
ful of rooters supported the team at
Union. The football spirit seems to

bunch of hikers, not the least jolly of
whom were Dr. tiroasdale and Miss

an hour's ride the buses reached their
destination and the girls disembarde
to climb about the mountain and ex-
plore everything explorable or unex-
plorable to be found, and there was
quite a considerable number of things
to be examined, for the indian Lad-

State's men

The Union frosh team, composed
nlirely of experienced former hiin
school players, started off the first
period in whirlwind fashion, but failed
to discourage the Purple and Gold
jerscyed players. The Prosh kicked
off in the first quarter to a point be-
hind State‘s goal line. The ball was
then put in play on the twenty-yard
line and on the play the yearlings
gained the ball on the twenty-five
yard nutrk on a fumble, but lost it all
three straight downs.

State, unsuccessful in their two at-
tempts to pierce the Union defense,
resorted to drop kicks, Union ob«
tained the ball on their thirty-yard
line and went over for a touchdown
on the next two downs. Makofski,
speedy Union full hack, ran the ball
over the goal line in the second per-
iod for the second and filial six-
pointer made by the l"rosh.

(.‘aton, State's full back, showed up
the Union team in the third quarter,
when he made a spectacular eighty-
fire yard end run for a clean IOUCli‘
down. marking State's only tally in
the game.

This play revived the fightingr spirit
in the Purple antl Cold warriors and
held the Garnet to three points in the

last half, Loughlin booting the ball
over the goal or a “flukey” field
kick.

With the result of Saturday's game,
Coach Snavely, who deserves the
credit for putting State College on
the football mat) for the first time in
the history of the college, is confident
of a good grid squad this year. State
will tackle the Rochester School of
Optometry Saturday at Rochester and
from present indications the “bacon
will be brought home to Albany."
