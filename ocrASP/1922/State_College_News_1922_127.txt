WHEN DO WE CHEER?

How about a [Soosters’ Club? Don't
you think there should be a real live
bunch of fans at State r
'l‘here ltas been no cheer practice this
fall. and the football season is well
under way. A week from Saturday
the first ltotnc game will be played
at the Ridgetield gridiron. You are
all going to the game to back up the
team. Individual cheering may help a
lot', but a big volume of well regu-
lated noise will help a great deal
more.

If we want to have a good cheering
section for the game, we will have to
practice soon. There should be
plenty of fellows ready to try out for
the job of cheer leader. Why not de»
vote part of a chapel period at least,
to a good cheer practice? We are all
boosters. All we need is a chance to
show it.

HELP WANTED

in the issue of September 28, the
” News" issued a call for tryouts for
reporters from the two under classes.
The response has been good, but not
good enough. More freshmen and
sophomores are needed. Up to the
present time journalism, as a branch
of student activity, has been sadly
neglected.

We want to make the “News” the
Iinest representative of State. We
want our paper to be just as good as
that of any other college. To do this
we must have help. Now. fresh and
soph, if you have any ability at news
getting, come to the ofﬁce for an
assignment.

OUR COLLEGE TRADITIONS

To the freshmen, college traditions
are those things Mys auia talks so
much about and over which the
sophomores make such a lot of un-
necessary fnss. To the large majority
of the rest of the student body, they
are those legitimate rules the disre-
garding of which by the frosli entitles
the sophomore class to inﬂict punish-
ment consisting of many a torture,
cmlmrrassmcnt. and inconvenience on
the part of the orring frosll.

But how many of us take the true
attitude of respect and love that
obedience to the traditions of the col-
leg- means?

The traditions we have were not

made by some spiteful soph in the
years past, as many a soph supposes,
nor were they made for the purpose
of bringing rebellion into the hearts
of us, They were, instead, made by
students who ‘have lived here at State.
who have sought in their ('tlllC'llttt]
here to learn the truth of life. and
Who have loved State ('ullege. and.
having loved her, have instituted rus-
toms to be handed down yearly to
the incoming class to be kept by each
one all through his sojourn here.
'I‘liey hespcztk of the dignity of our
Alma Mater and give to her a human
response that she would lack were she
not to have them.
"reshnien, sophomore juniors. sen<
im's,-—thcy are your traditions. What
are you going to do with them? If
you disregard them, you make the
name of your college resound ridic-
ulously in the ears of standers-by. If
you love them, because they are your
traditiot ,- you make of your Alma
Mater a sacred thing.

if hmen, do you want to make
your Alma Mater a joke in the eyes
of others by disregarding those dc-
niamls which are legally atid tradition-
ally hers to demand?

Upperclassnien, are you going to
laugh when you see a freshman “get
-away" with something, or are you
going to explain to that freshman just
what it means to break a tradition?

The way you answer these ques-
tions will show the depth of yottr love
for State College, and the height of
your own self-respect, for in lowering
a thing that should be an ideal in our
college life. we lower ourselves as
we .
So frosh—obey the traditions, show
State College hotv much you respect
her.

And upperclassmen—yon who have
been here longer, who have come to
love your Alina Mater—make your
traditions a living, vital institution
and give them the place they should
have in your college life. ' .'

 

 

 

 

 

 

   

 

FRESHMAN IMPRESSIONS

The initiation of a young mall or
woman into college life marks the
birth of a new epoch upon the thresh-
old of which he pauses atid timidly
surveys his future. The impre
made upon him the first few wce s .
a “ frosh ” are lasting and may affect,
in many ways, his
career.

The first and most pleasant perhaps
is that mode by the hearty and sin-
eere spirit of welcome and 'ongen
ity which marks the reception of each
and every individual enteriiigi'S. C. 1‘.

the upper classes, excluding, of

 

 

course, his immediate predecessors,
the incorrigible “sophs.” who utterly
lack every vestige of sympathy or
understanding. The institution of
"junior sisters " is a splendid example
of the desire of the students to lend a
ielping hand. It is indeed no easy
ask to lake itt lllllltl three hundred

men and enable them to meet and en—
joy the company of entire strangers.

and to conduct themselves in accord-
ance with traditions seemingly di-
rected against their comfort and well-
beiug. Yet this is precisely what our

however numerous, we are welcome,
that we have found a new home in
our Alma Mater and that to' be true
college students we must live up to
her traditions and pass them on to
those who are to follow its.

Another fact fully impressed upon
us is that every one works in college.

t THE ’25-'26 PUMPKIN RUSH
; It is rumored that a Freshman-
‘Sophomore pumpkin rush was at
tempted Saturday night after the G.
-\. .-\. bike. it seems that some of the
ﬁnphs anticipated the desire of some
members of the class of '26 to reach
their lock rs by the main entrance
since college was not in session. They
formed a reception committee on the
front steps to eminnand the lirosh to
use the side doors. 't‘ired and hungry
the lfrnsh found the side doors locked
and in their hurry forgot just where
the sidewalk was situated at the cot"
ner. Thus when they reached the
back door the Sophomores with arms
outstretched asked them to enter and
give names, For a moment it seemed
as if pumpkins and sticks, relics of in»

door at the unlucky Sophs, but a bet-
