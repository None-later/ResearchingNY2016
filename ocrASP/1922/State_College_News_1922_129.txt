SCHOOL OF CITIZENSHIP AT

plirey, of Trinity College. "‘ Modern

Democracy."

l'rofessor M. Mahmoud, president
of the Oxford lnteriiatinnal assciiihly
of stttdent delegates. addressed the
evening sessiont lie spoke on
“America and the League of Nations"
and said in part: “Those who argue
that America should not join the
League of Nations hecaiise of the pos-
sihility of eiiihroiliiig the United
States in international politics, are the
Rip Van Wiiikles of politics who arc
Iiotli out of titne and out of tune,
horn one and one-half L‘cttttiries too
late,"

“There can he only lWO point.. of
on the League of Natioiis,-—the
iitioii aiitl the results which its
cs have produced. l‘hc reasons.
which the United States_gives and
has gizcii for its i‘ion—participation ‘III
the League sounds like ‘Iieads i win.
tails you lose.”

Mr. M ahmood presented foiir prop...
sitions for the Consideration of the
school. The first, he said, was the
I'lt". that the League reorestnt; a pro-
ssive ideal which tli: world can not
.orc. and which the United Stainu
is accepted. ’l‘lie League is the
only pci‘iiianent institution for the ex-
prcssiou of the International ideal of
the cultural tinity of humanity.

The second was the fact that the
League is not onlv ideal, hut one
which has; product d results; which
represents not only the solidarity of
lalior, htit that of lahoi‘ and capital to»
gctliei‘. .

The third was that the League is
not only a political proposition, hut is
devoted to such humanitarian micr-

l as an international code ol ins-
and the development of edu-
cation and civic. improvement III all
countries.

'l'he foiirtli was that by its re
letter to the League,
States has ollirially recognized the ex-
istent-c of that hotly and can, having
rccoznizcil its existence. go farther irith~
out making a declaration of its policies
in regard to it.

Then l’i‘ofcssor Walker presented
licfore the school the, stilijeel. " inimi-

as invasion, conquest, colonization.
and immigration. defining each move-
ment and giving it its place in history.
“ Lahor." said l’rotessor Walker, "is
alwavs moving up. and our limitations
on imiiiigraliou Will necessarily result

traetors will complain of lack of lahoi'
and housewives Will complain of a
