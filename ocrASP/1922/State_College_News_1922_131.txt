CAMPUS DAY

Well, Fresh, are you not just a
wee bit weary of grinding over the
“barbarian migrations” and of buy-
ning the midnight oil in a vain
attempt to develop an Inspiration for
that long theme'.’ Are you a triilc
bored with stereotyped receptio’ns
punctilious “ muffin - struggles . ?
Have you become so fatigued with
study, social functions, and acting
nice that you feel as if your own
natural sell" just had to burst forth?
Do you not just want to break the
bonds of adult convention and be-
have the way you did when you
were young and free? Oh, for the
thrill of a whole afternoon. and eve—
ning of complete relaxation from
all studious and social duties, and for
the rc-creatwn of our natural habits.
Would not such a release of tension
be wonderful?
but all State collegians loudly second
the motion. . _

ehevious trick of running outat times

circumstance we must watch it con-
stantly. Fate usually wills, when pep

stimulus which, if applied, Will rescue

It seems to me that some of the
female folks around . C T are
missin a lot of the joy of life. They
dutifu ly parade the halls. Oh, yes,
and they dutifully absorb or don't

absorb the gems of wisdom presented

to them by the hard workng pro-
fessors. They are content to work
or be amused all day long', eat board-
ing house food, and just exist. I
know all about them because I was
one of them for a long time. Now
I am a changed woman! I consider
myself vitally alive! The reason?

It happened not long ago that a
gay yopng athlete possessed herself
of me (very lz'orceiibly), and placed
me on the campus in the midst of
bloomered and sneakered individuals
who seemed to have at once a liking
and an aversion for one lone leather
basketball. They chased the poor
object around at an.awl'iil rate of
speed, and, when they reached it,
they fell over it or kielred it violently.
So did I for two e citing hours.
Since then I have played it so much

they seem big. Altho the budeet has

is too late for any comments other
than the usual “what might have
been ” that always permeate the
air after any event of note has taken
place. We do not intend to dip our
pen in vitrol, tritely speaking, nor do
we wish to use whitewash: but we
would like to direct your glances to
the amount of attention that the
budget pays to the masculine con-
tingent of S. C. ’I‘.

e have delved deep into what we
can remember of eighth grade
mathematics, and we ﬁnd that the 150
men' (of whom State College is
justly proud) are receiving approxi-
mately $15.00 apiece for athletics.
Not that we disapprove of men’s ath~
letics. Dear me. no! We are
with the rest of the college as far
as baseball and basketball teams are
concerned, and we will stand behind
our men to the last hoarse yelp. But
what we are coming at is a question
of fair play. These men, represent-
ing one—ﬁfth of all C. T. are get-
ting $2,350 for their athletics. The
Womens' Athletic Association, which
stands for four-ﬁfths of State Col-
lege, receives $250, or the magniﬁ»
cent sum of forty-one cents apiece
for each' member.

The girls have no varsity teams.
All they can do is cheer for the men.
And would it not be better if they
could have something worth while
spending energy upon, as they would
have if the men should bend their

efforts seriously to one major sport
without trying so many?

‘ It 150 men are to represent the
whole of State College on the “ field
of honor ” with other institutions are
they, or are they not to have the
entire jurisdiction oyer whether 0"

wasn't there that day, she ha: evi<
idently been thinking seriously about
,certain athletic matters ﬁnancial and
otherwise. However just her claims
may seem to be, they fade rapidly
when viewed in a penetrating light

The ﬁrst objection is that the men
receive $2,350 for athletics while
,the women receive only $250. That
[is unfair when Viewed supcrﬁmally.
,But what does that $2,350 do? Do
lthe men receive any enioym'mt from
it? They may, but only indirectly
Sas a. result of their own work. Not
one cent is spent to provide "gym
fi'olics" for the men: The greater
part of this money is spent to provide
ihome games. to supply an orchestra
il'or dancing after the games, and to
furnish comfortable accommodations
for the spectators as well as for the
team. A game away from home costs
the student body nothing. Every ex-
pense is covered by the guarantee
,liurnishctl by the home team.
the greater part is spent to provide
entertainment for the student body.
four-ﬁfths ‘of which is made up of
the-feminine contingent. To provide
this entertainment, if it may be
thought of ‘as a niafter’of 'dollar
and cents, most of the” men: spend
strenuous practice hours day after
ay. Do they enjoy it? Of course
they do. but it is no fun for them.
Their time and their energy is not
spent for self glory or pleasure, but
for to bring honor to'their’college.
During the past week one of the
members of our football tea}n,ywas

Was be trying to do his best or was
he not. The question does not have
to be answered. And after the
season is over no athletic team has
a banquet in its honor. Its reward
is the praise of the student body be-
!ind it—and sometimes it doesn't
get that. ‘ '

The second objection seems to be
that the girls do not have any power
ove‘.‘ the work of any men's athletic
tr-am. Yet they compose four-ﬁfths
of our college population. We do
not know how much time ’25 has
spent in the serious consideration of
this problem. She contends that the
'rirls should have more iurisdiction in
athletic matter, but in the Very same
sentence she states that “ all they
can do is cheer for the men.” We
think that she underestimates 'the
tapabilitics of the rest of the girls
‘nywav. The gi“ls should have and
do have more power in these mat-
ters. The writer of the above article
gives as‘a reason for the failure of
State’s teams too {vreat a number of
‘naior spo‘ts. That is easy to say,
but harder to prove, No two sports
are carried on at one time. Does
she know the real reason for the.
failure of our basketball team last

year? It was girls. While the
coach had certain training rules.
none of which were seve 'e. the

athletes. or at least seine of them.
found it much mo"e pleasant to
spend their time with membe's of
the four-ﬁfths maiority than to he
in bed at ten o’clock as the rules
called for. And they were tolerated
with the result -above stated. Why
can’t our girls use their influence
to" upbuilding the teams? Girls in
other co-ed colleges. like North-
western and Chicago Universities, are
'loine' it. State College oue'ht to do
the same. Girls, ﬁnd out what the
training rules are. and help the men
observe them. Each girl can do
more than cheer. Ilia can make or
rank any team. This, '25, is the
