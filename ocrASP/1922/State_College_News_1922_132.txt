business meeting in which candidates
were nominated for the ollice of vice-
president, which had been left vacant
when lietty Bach became president.
It was also decided that the reiiuire~
nents for running letters and numer-
als be changed. This year one hun-
dred counts will be required instead
oi‘ the seventy-two counts ol‘ last
year. in this way the girls who want
letters will have to work a little
iarder to earn them.

After the meeting the entertainv
ment committee staged an imitation
of student assembly in “What
Might Have Happened ” ii" the repre-
reprcsentativcs of each of the major
sports had demanded more money
for his sport. Football caused a
great deal of excitement by being so
aggressive in a demand for more
money, for it seemed to think the
Future prospects would require it.

The depressing iniluence of “What
Might Have Happened " was re—
lieved by a lively basketball game be-
tween the ilappcrs and the greasy-
grinds. The rest oi" the evening was
given over to dancing and a general
good time.
