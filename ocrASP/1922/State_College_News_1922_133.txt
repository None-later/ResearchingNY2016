not have to go thru a receiving line,
and we shall not have to be affable to
people “ whom we just can’t stand.”
0h joy 0 joys, won’t We have
oodles of fun?" And of course,
dear freshies, you are going to Join
us in all these thrills—We can not
possibly get along without you and
we know that you will just love to
come and have a jolly good romp
with us. So do you wonder that not
one of us can hardly wait until
Saturday, October 29, at 12:30 when
the big fun begins? There will
surely be one stimulus by which each
individual of State College can re-
juvinate and pep up his morale.
Here goes—-just take your pick —»—
athletic sports of every nature, cheer—
ing for our team, singing, dancing,
and eating. Now, “ain‘t we got
fun”?!

Do we
whisper in

hear a verdant freshman
subdued tones to her
locker-mate: “Is there a Campus
Day each year? " Yes,, there is. in
1920 some one was struck with the
happiest inspiration that could come
to mortal mind and that inspiration
materialized in our ﬁrst Campus Day.
We all had such a perfectly glorious
time that Myskania decided to make
it a college tradition.
Day symbolical of that wonderful,
a real get-
together on the campus for a day of
sport and recreation early in the
college year.

THE TEACHERS' CONVOCATION

On 'l‘hursduy and Friday of the
past week, the principal division of
the convocation was held in the Edu-
cation building. 'l‘hursday erening
Governor Miller spoke on “’l‘hc Needs
of the Public Schools of the State."
He brought out in his address that
the country schools were suffering
from poverty, which is due to a poor
method of taxation, and the city
schools were lacking in building
facilities, caused by local political in—
ilucnce. He ﬁnished by saying that
he bclieVed that the State should go
as far as necessary in aiding finan-
cially the schools, even if it had to
maintain them wholly.

On Friday morning, a discussion
of the rural school survey was held.

bers brought a report before the con-
vocation, which was adversely criti-
cised by Charles F. Wheelock, Sec-
ond Commissioner of Education, who
showed that the survey was wrong
for country high schools. Friday
afternoon, Commissioner Wyley and
Superintendent Kinn spoke favorably
for the survey. ’l‘hey urged the
legislature to carry out the report of
the committee. '
Henry Suzzallo, President of the
University of Washington spoke.

O'Hara— And are ye going to
leave this pile o’ dirt here all night?

O'Mara—Begorra, phwat will 0i
do wi' it, man?

“Dig a hole and shovel it in.”
