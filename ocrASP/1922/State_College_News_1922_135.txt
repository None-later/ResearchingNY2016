'State Entertains Congress of
Mothers

MRS. H.’ 0. HOLLAND ADDRESS
FRESHMEN WOMEN

Last 'l‘hursday a meeting of the
New York Congress of Mothers was
held at Chancellor’s Hall, when a long
interesting program was presented.

In the afternoon, the Home Eco-
nomics Department of State College,
under the auspices of Miss Grace
Gillette, extended a cordial invitation
for the delegates to come and visit
State College. The invitation was
accepted with enthusiasm and over
a hundred delegates enjoyed the hos-
pitality oi' the college. 'l‘hese guests
were weiconied by Miss Gillette, Dr.
Croesdale, Miss Pierce, and Miss
Frear. Tim was served in the Home
Economics Department by his
Steele, Miss Filiinglmm, Miss Salton,
and iss Thompson, who were
assisted by the newly organized Home
Economics Club.

Later in the afternoon, Mrs. Henry
Osgood Holland of Buil‘alo, the
national vice-president and former
president of the New York Congress
of Mothers, address the freshmen
women at the usual lecture in the
auditorium.

Her ciiariiiing manner won the iii-
stant attention of all which did not
waver for one solid half hour. She
warned them of the danger of under-
estimating their ability for leader-
ship. The girls of today will be the
leaders of tomorrow and each has a
place awaiting her. They should re-
view often what they have been
doing to see if they have been suffer-
ing from underestimation of their
powurs, and correct it With more self-
confidence.

Mrs. Holland said everyone exerts
some influence or “ iii-flow-encc " as
she liked to pronounce it, on those
about them. Their lives should be
so full that something good from
them would overflow into another.
Girls, she said, have a greater _in-
iluence over boys than they realise.

boys who are incessant smokers, who

for Troop Captains

COURSE OFFERED AT STATE

 

Mrs. Eddy, of New York
National Chairman of the Girl Scout
Organization, made a plea in usscin'
biy Friday morning to the girls of
State College for Girl Scout captains.
A brief history of the movement was
given, which started in England at
the time of the Boer War, and since
then has spread rapidly throughout
the Old and the New World. The
aim of the movement is to teach per-
sonai hygiene, a few first aid rules,
and the. minor household arts. A
Girl Scout’s pledge is three-fold — to
do her duty to her God, her country
and herself; and her tenderf'oot laws
involve honor, loyalty, cheerl'ulness,
thriftiness, and cleanliness in thought,
word, and deed. 'l‘his organimrtion
with such great purposes in view and
with ii membership of over 110,000
girls is now cramped for want of
leaders. Mrs. Eddy ended her
speech with a teaching little story
illustrating the trustworthiness of a
scout, which in itself was an appeal
for captains. Announcement was
made that there would be courses for
Girl Scout leaders Tuesday evening
from 7:30 to i) :00 in the Chapel of
the First Presbyterian Church, and
’i‘hursday afternoons from Al :00 to
5:30 in the College Auditorium.
interesting speakers will deliver ad-
dresses. Ali college girls are urged
to attend.

Parent-Teachers Association
Meets in Albany

DEFINES TEACHERS STANDARDS

 

The National Congress of the
Parent Teachers Association held
during the past week here in Albany
is of special interest to the student
body of State College in view of the
fact that soon it will be attempting
to cope with the problems this asso-
ciation is attempting to solve throuin
organized efforts.

The ﬁrst National Congress, t..'~n
called the National Congress of
Mothers, was held twenty-six years
ago under the leadership of Mrs. 'l‘hc-
odorc Burncy. Mrs. Burney, a young
gifted mother realized that, with the
progressing age, time and place were
being given to and laws passed for
the care of ﬂowers, animal life, aml
practically everything else except the
development of our future citizens.
But she lacked the money to ﬁnance
her dream of an organization through

which such problems might be solved. 2

Mrs. Phoebe Hurst, the woman who
ﬁnanced the ﬁrst Christian kinder“
garten in America, agreed to ﬁnance
the proposition for two years and
await results.

The New York Branch was started
the following year. It is one of the
