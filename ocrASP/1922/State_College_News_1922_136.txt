THE KNOCK OF OPPORTUNITY

How many of us recognized the
opportunity with which we were pre-
sentcd on Friday’.’ Between the lines
of the address which was delivered
in chapel, how many of us‘found the
solution to that problem of how we
might best be of service to our fel-
low-men while here in college. There
is no doubt but that our interest was
aroused. The question we must now
consider is “ was that interest merely
a passive one, or are we going to
respond actively to this splendid ap-
peal for service to the youth of
Albany through the medium of the
Girl Scout Organization? "

In a lesser way, State College has
these same ideals of comradeship and
kindly aid embodied in our Junior
Sister movement. No junior is ever
too busy to stop to untangle for any
freshman one of the many tangltis of
college life. But not all can proﬁt
by i. The sophomores, for ex—
ample, have no outlet for those fre—
quent, overpowering desires to serve
humanity in however mangled a
form. The freshmen see their every
care vanish before the magic of
Isisterly solicitude, and yet, they too
are at a loss to determine the best
method of student service. So a.
kindly fate, sensing all these difﬁ-
culties and realizing that they must
be cleared away to make room for
those,caused by “billet doux," sent
to us this opportunity.

And the ﬁnest thing is that this
opportunity will not be purely an
altruistic one. For through the de-
sire to aid will be our main ob-
jective, still, none of us will turn his
back on the numerous good times
which will be found along the way-
side of service. Then, too, this inti-
mate contact with the adolescent
youth will familiarize us with his

ATTENTION FRESHMEN!

Now that the ﬁrst weeks with their
mad rush are over, you are bcg'ln-
hing to look about and wonder what
you can do to help your college.
Many of the clubs are open only to
the upper classmen. But here is the
answer to your question -——Serve the
Quarterly. .

The Quarterly is the college liter-
ary magazine, published, as the title
suggests, four times each year.
has been the policy of this publlcxv

.—
er

 

tiou to allow freshmen a chance to
serve on the stall‘ by having them
assist the advertisimv,’ managers.
Many of you come from schools
where they have a your book or a
college paper, and bare rotten ads
for that. To you the wor will not

be entirely strange. Then there are
those of you who have always

wanted to do this kind of work, but
have never had the opportunity. To
you we otfer the chance that you
have always wanted. The contest for
you begins today; and if you are

 

interested or wish u. fuller explana-
tion than it is possible to give here
see Wilhelmina Westbrook or Ervo
E. Littell in the Co—op, or leave a
note for them in their mail boxes.

Ones life should not be bounded
by studies alone, because he misses
the noblest thing that college has to
offer—the chance to serve. For It
is only thro' such service that you
can come to the fullest and ﬁnest
understanding of all that college
means.

 

 

 

A SUGGESTION

‘Xlll you open your college 50m:
boo s and sing- the Alma Mater?
Now will you sing College of the
Empire State? Just stop and think
about them. Which has the more
dignity? Which has the easier range
for al voices? Which is in every
way the more suitable? College of
the Empire State, of course, you say.
You had never thought of it, now
had you? Have we ever really had
an Alma Mater, handed down by tru-
dition'l No, the time has been
changed to suit the fancy or the pass-
inp; whim of a few students who in-
llucnce the student body. ldven the,
words are twisted about so that the'
song is unrecognizable. The men
either keep quiet durinp: the sineine'
of it or strain unsuccessfully to reach
the high notes which, even the women
find diilicult to master. When we are
called upon to sing; a eollcu'c song;
it is not our Alma Mater we sing
but College of the Empire State.
Why have an Alma Mater which is
not an Alma Mater?

With how much more zest and
vim we sinp; College of the Empire
State? It is more dignified; it is
more beautiful; it was composed by
a former student of State College.
It is far more suitable for an Alma
Mater than the one We now aim: as
such;

Think it over seriously, students.
Talk about it.’ Give this suggestion
thoughtful consideration so that our
college may be improved in still an-
other. way, so that we may have an
Alma Mater to love and be proud of.

FIND YOURSELF IN SPORT

’l‘hoso who are interested in ath-
letics will never cease tlppealinpr to
others who are missinp; what they
consider one of the keenest enjoy
ments of life. We make this appeal
not primarily to the so-called “nth-
letic girl," but to the average col-
lege student who is searching: out the
best her school affords.

e have heard many college
graduates say that of the four years
spent at their Alma Mater they value
most the friendships they made while
there. Almost every student recon;-
nizes the truth of this and attempts
to become acquainted with girls of a
congenial personality; but the atmos-
phere of tho'eluss demands a certain
amount of reserve. and dignity, which
one must maintain, or otherwise be
considered foolish. Outside the class-
room. group activities conceal her
individuality, and she remains, to the
girls whose friendship she desires,
like all the others about her. What
can she do to gain recognition? She
cannot rush up frantically and de-
mand it; but she can meet them in-
formally, nnd reveal her true self in
athletics where reserve g'ives place to
naturalness. if she forcgoes her
