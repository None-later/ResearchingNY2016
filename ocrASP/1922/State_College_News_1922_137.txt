Y HOLDS ANNUAL BANQUET

Wednesday night, October 25, the
Y. W. C. A. gave a banquet in the
cafeteria for the cabinet officers and
their committees. It was a most dc-

Iightt’ul all'air, iI’ the enthusiastic p

praises of those who went indicate a
good time.

The very adaptable cafeteria tables
were assembled in the form of a huge
Y, around which the banquetcrs were
seated in such a way as to get the
entire benefit of all the speeches and
songs. During and between courses
the huge human Y would burst into
songs and cheers, lead by Marjorie
Blythe.

Speaking in terms of food, the
banquet was quite suiliciently and
deliciously satisfactory. Speaking in
terms of good cheer and fun, the
banquet was infinitely successful.
Helen Leary, the toastmistress gave
to each committee more than due
praise for the work it had done for
Y. W. and college, along with an
explanation of the duties of each
committee, and its share in further-
ing the work of As a token
of appreciation Y. W. gave to each
committee member a bow of ribbon
of the color symbolizing the purpose
oi her work,—- Nor were the oilicers
forgotten in the presentation of sym-
bolic ribbons. lilacli officer received
a bow of appropriately colored rib-
bon for her sei'Vices to the organiza-
tion —-although she attempted to
prove herself unworthy of praise.

After each committee had been
decorated and complimented, Betty
Renner talked .about Silver Bay,
making every girl more enthusiastic
than ever about it, and making each
resolve to do her best either to go
herself or to get some one else to go
to Silver Bay next year.

Miss Pierce, Mrs. Stinard, Mrs.
French, Miss Scotland, Miss Wallace,
Miss Arnold, Miss Cobb, and Eunice
Rice, members of the advisory board
and the faculty declared their inter-
ost_in all the Y. W. work, and pledged
their sincere support at all times to
all of Y. W‘s activities.

The banquet ended, and the girls,
after signing their neighbors’ place
cards, .wcnt home with the thoughts
in their hearts of one of the songs
sung during the banquet—

“ Who welcomed us as freshmen?

Y .

Who gives the pop to college?
. . C. A.
Who gives as deep inspiration ?

’I‘hat'siwhy we should all belong to
Y. W. C. A.

THE COLLEGE ORCHESTRA

With so much pleasant chatter
flitting,r back and forth through the
pages of our College News, some of
us are let to wonder whether we, too,
cannot add our wee voice to the
chorus and bring before the general
ublic of our institution ll. college
organization which up to the present
writing, has remained modestly and
serenely in the background. ’I‘hey of
our number, who have returned to
us for another year’s fun (and
work), will recollect that, somewhere
in the misty oblivion of Inﬁll-22,
State College had an orchestra.
Seine of our particular friends may
even condeseend to magnify minuti-
recollections to such an extent as to
tell us that they have even heard
that orchestra perform.

Be that as it may, last year has
passed, but 1922-23 has found the
orchestra again with its toes on the
line and, then, away, keeping pace
with the other college classes. Under
the careful and competent guardian—
ship of Professor Candlyn, the or-
chestra has had a thorough work-out
every Tuesday evening and expects,
in the very near future, to make its
ﬁrst public appearance of the season.

At a meeting of the orchestra on
'I‘ucsday evening, October 17th, the
following Ofﬁcers were elected for
the year IEIZ‘Z-ZB:

President, G. Aronowitz, ’25);
librarians, A. Sohns, ’26; A. Wallace,
‘24; director of settings, S. Merritt,
'25

Our enrollment consists of Ill
members, as folows: Piano, I).
Dangermond, ‘23; 1st violinist, G.
Aronowitz, ’23; I‘. Briggs, ’26; E.
Pcrsk, '26; A. Sohns, ’26; 2nd violins,
F. Gillett, '2“; S. Merritt, ’25; cello,
It. Johnson, ’25; saxophones, J.
Anderson (special), B. Dunn, ’26;
mandolins, H. Arthur, ‘26; A. Den—

Hoyt, ’25; I‘). Layton. ‘26; It. Ogs—
burg (special); M. Van Buren, ’23;
A. Wallace, “24', tenor banjo, II.
Cussler, ’26.

We do not attempt to conceal the
fact that we have received splendid
reinforcements from the class of '26,
nor do we hesitate to say that we
would gladly welcome any college
student. musically inclined, who
should desire to join} our number.
'l‘hough he may not aspire to take the
course forcredit, we assure anyone,
with pure red blood and human in-
telligencc, that he will find himself
well repaid by the good fellowship
and congenial spirit which predomi—
nates at our weekly meetings, taking
into consideration, also, the excellent
musical drill he will receive. Let
him come and see for himse " ,
Tuesday evening, from 7 to 9, in
Room B and . bring his instru—
ment. —’25

 

SOPHS SLING PAINT
'I‘he Sophs staged an important
“get wise " meeting for the beneﬁt
of those freshmen attending History
2 lecture on Monday. They set the
stage by locking and guarding all
exits of chapel. 'I‘Iiis kindness to the

M class of ’26 was much appreciated

as it forced all Frosh to attend their
class meeting. At the end of which
an immediate rush for the doors, dis—
closed the fact that the Sophs meant
business. With frantic efforts the
Fresh forced the door back of the
rostrum only to be met by two Sophs
who arrogantlv demanded their
names. However, it is the belief of
’26 that if the Sophs use this list for
penalties, it will contain names
utterly foreign to those on the
Freshman roll. ’I‘hcn someone had
the heaven-sent idea to jump from

on the Sclienectiuly road. The bug
is typical. being covered on the outer
edge with high bluehe-‘y bushes, thin
leather-leaf and further in with cran-
berries and swamp willow, and lastly
with sphagnuin moss. 'I‘his mess is
an antiseptic and was used as such
during the war. Due to the acidic
excretions. which defuse through the
water, killing the bacteria. this moss
keeps the entire bog sterile.

started by those of the alumni and
faculty who realized the great need
of State for dormitories. ’l‘hey saw
that, although the college was grown
ang and becoming more and more
eﬂicient, it would gain a better stand-
ing and would gain it sooner if some-
thing were done to solve the question
of boarding places, which Ii. been
a great handicap to the college. The
campaign which they launched was
supported so enthusiastically by
everyone that the committees hope
for a great success.

During the summer very little
actual campaigning was done, but
new plans are being made which de-
mand rigor Iii-cause of the lull; and
