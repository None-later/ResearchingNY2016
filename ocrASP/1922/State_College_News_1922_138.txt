drink, and lead a rather wild life in
general, they will do just that. But,
if girls demand a better type of man-
hood than this, they will then seek to
attain it.

Another thing she spoke of was
cheerfulness. You can always help
out the other fellow with a cherry
smile. When, for example, you get
twenty per cent in a quiz and are
feeling just about ultramarinc blue,
repeat the following bit of poetry:

“ ’l‘he dog’s in the pantry,

The cat's in the lake,

The cow’s in the hominock, ‘

But, what difference does it
make? ” ‘

She said that that might possibly
help to make them forget their mis-
fortune and smile in spite of it, with
the hopes of doing better next time.

Last of all, she told the Freshmen
to climb, and to keep on climbing on-
ward and upward. They must never
forget their ideals formed early in
life, and, as they grow older, ever
seek to attain them. For, is it not
our high ideals which mold our lives?

oldest branches of the organization.
Since that time the Association has
continued to grow until there are
now over ﬁve thousand affiliated

clubs in the country.

As a result of the Congress, ap-
peals are being made for larger
salaries for teachers of rural schools
in order that the advantages of rural
districts may be as great as these of
city schools.

Recommendations were made that
all fraternities and sororities be dis-
continued in high schools because of
the great problem they present to
the teacher and parent dealing with
the adolescent child.

Also, recommendations were
passed, that public speaking be made
a compulsory course in all colleges
in view of the fact that this pro-
gressive age demands that everyone
be able to stand before an audience
and give an intelligent address.

The attitude of the Association to—
wards teachers’ colleges is clearly
shown in the statement made by Mrs.
John D. Whish, former president and
present member of the board of
directors, in an interview recently:
“We fully realize,” stated Mrs.
Whish, “that the teacher is a most
important factor in the training of
the child, and that without their co-
operation we cannot reach the goals
we strive to attain for our children.

Our purpose is to do all we can
to cooperate with the teachers. To
many of us the character of the
teacher is even of more vital im-
portance than her teaching ability.
We feel that the standard of our
teachers should be 100 per cent
Americanism, high standard of
morals, and most of all, great love
i'or her students and her work.

In fact, the Whole organization is
an organized effort on the part of
both parents and teachers to co-
operate in the education of the
children of the nation." '

sportsmanship, would in no way on-

because she fears ridicule of awk-

change her attitude, and realize that

accomplished before the Sophs dis-
covered their mistake in not locking
the windows, opened the front door.
At once a mob of hungry, anxious
Fresh rushed out, surprised and
gaining confidence at finding no
Sophs, they sought the stairway to
the basement. Here consternation
reigned. 'l‘he Sophs evidently had
decided to tighten up a bit on their
rather liix enforcement of college tra-
ditions for careless, buttonless Frosli
were profusely decorated with blue
paint. Any deﬁant member of ’26
was forced to submit by ii ﬁrm grip
on his hair. The last of the Fresh

were outnumbered, but an opportune
dash of cold water from the boy's
locker room dampened the ﬁghting
spirit of the Sophs and at the appear-
ance of Myskania they scattered.

way. The oii‘ice of the "
Hall Campaign has been changed
from Room 103, where it was last
year, to Miss Pierccs’ ofﬁce, due to
the very crowded conditions which
have been caused by a large fresh-
man registration.

On October twelfth, this statement
of the progress of the campaign was
given out:

Number of persons pledged, 634.

Total amount pledged, $56,906.47.

Total amount received, $6,463.89.

[t has been suggested that those
who have pledged themselves to aid
this campaign will renew their cfl‘o‘ts;
to earn money and consult the dif-
ferent committees in charge; and
also, that those who have not yet
pledged themselves will do so very
soon.
