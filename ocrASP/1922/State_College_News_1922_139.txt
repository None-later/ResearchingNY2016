Dr. Bernard Clausen ol Syra-
cuse Addresses Student Body

SPEAKS 0N “RELIGION AT
TWENTY-ONE" AT REQUEST
0F Y. W.

’l‘hursday ulternoon, October M
the student body was given he
opportunity of hearing Dr. Bernard
C. Clausen of Syracuse, who spoke
under the auspices of A..
Dr. Clausen who, at twuntyunine is
recognized all over the country a.‘
one of the most forceful preachers
of the day, spoke here at college on
“Religion at ’l‘wenty-omn"

)i'. Clausen’s talk was "ei'y
informal, beginning with his descrip
tion of a strange and vivid advent—
ure which he had evpei'ienced for a
year, when he lived in the midst of
ii tribe of natives whose problems
,arc forever I ting the world. L‘pon
ithis tribe depends the future of the
ih'ingdom of God. If it is converted
so is the world, otherwise ruin results.
And yet this tril is the eternal pu7
izle of all outsiders. They do not

  

 

 

 

iundei'stand the language, the cus«
items, the music, the attitudi- of
1 the tribe members. They cannot

loll‘er a solution for this independent
iinass, therefore they label the tribe
las lit only for eternal'dainnation.
[This strange people which so per-
lplexes the world is bounded on the
north by youth's courz on tln.
south by youth’s enthus .' on the
east by youth‘s dreams, and on the
west by youth’s ideals. It is called
“ ’l'wenty-one.”

Although ’l‘wentv-one uses much
the same languugi as the rest of the
world, the meaning of the words is
so dil'fe-ent that it makes a gap be-
tween ’l'wenty-mn: and the rest of
civilization which is greater than that
