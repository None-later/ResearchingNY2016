A QUESTION OF COMMON SENSE

During the past few years the
(Iuestion whether the “Alma Mater,
as we know it, has the characteristics
of a real college anthem, has come
up for discussmn at various times.
’l'hc contest has waged from onesule
to another, and in the end the Situa-
tion has remained unchanged. Noth-
ing; has been (lone.

Now the question has. come up
again. A new song; book is about to
be published. Shall the Alma Mater
be included as State’s own college
song? There are many reasons why
it shouldn't be.

In the first place the average per—
son ﬁnds it ” unsingable.” If he isn
a Galli-Curci, he can‘t get up to the
top notes with a step ladderz The
extraordinary ranch makes it un-
popular. And so it isn’t heard very
much at student assemblies.

The tune is a borrowed one. It
does not primarily belong to us.
’l‘hcrel’ore it does not stand as
characteristic of State College. Any
other college or group of students
anywhere has the same right to use
it as we have.

At the present time “College of
the Empire State " is usurping the
honors as our college anthem. it IS
sung cverytime a group of students
get together. It is popular because
it is everything that a real college
song should be. It has a majestic
swng to it that “Alma Mater ”
with its jerky rythm cannot equal.
It is expressive of the college spirit,
the loyalty that typiﬁes State.

“ College of the Empire State " has
a tune of its own written by an
alumnus. No other group can use it.
It is written so that all voices can
reach it and it harmonizes well With
mixed voices.

The question is coming; up whether
We will retain “Alma Mater ” or re-
ject it for "College of the Empire
State.” This is a time for common
sense to rule over a foolish and mis-
taken tradition.

BILLETS DOUX PREMONITIONS

Billcts Doux are like measles——
you feel them coming; on but you
can’t get away from them no matter
where you go; you are perfectly dis-
gusted with yourself for getting them
and yet you couldn’t seem to be
it. And just as measles leave be‘
hind them effects felt long; after, so
billets doux leave behind sorely tried
hearts and disgusted nientalities that
stick with us oven until mid-years.

In a very few short weeks these
inevitable phenomena. will be upon
us with all the force of the history,
English, matehematics and other
equally terrifying departments. The
freshmen fear these phenomena, the
sophomores expectantly await them,
having realized their fate at the first
physics lecture, the juniors take them
as calmly as juniors take all things,
and with the senior they have become
“old stuff."

And meanwhile, what are you
going to do about it‘.l When you
receive your little notice, are you
going to give up all hopes and just
lie down and let the rest of the col—
leee sweep past you, or are you
going to prove to yourself and to the
college that, it takes more; than a
billet doux to put you out of the
race? Are you going to rave about
the unfairness of your profs or are
you going to take an inventory of
your own intelligence and find the
reason for that billet doux'.’

Are you, freshmen, going to let the
world say that you could stay in the
COIICQC only until they gavo a few
tests and that then you had to move
out, or are you going to get out of
your college course the very most by
takinp: your medicine when it comes
to you and proﬁt by it?

Billets doux do not mean that We
have failed. ’l‘hey do mean, however,
that unless we put more ell'ort into
our work, we stand a pretty good
chance of making a mess of thing's in
the future.

All of us get billets doux in time—
in a way, it’s a sort of systematic dose
of intellectual sulphur and me-
administered with the hope of hunt,
ing' us to the place where we will
realize our deﬁciencies and of offer-
inc; a startim.r place for correction.

So when billets doux come out this
year in State College, let’s not moan
or ravd or give up-— but instead,
let’s show the faculty we appreciate
their efforts; that we realize that
more of the fault lies with us than
it does with them; and put into those
subjects in which we are billets
douxed a little more conscientious
ell’ort, a little less indill‘erence, and
make the course in spite of the over-
whelming force of a billet doux.

LACK OF SCHOOL SPIRIT

For a few moments, I am going to
ask you to lay aside all class pre-
judice. A student who will not do
so for the good of his school should
be forced to leave his school.
am ging‘ to ask you to detach your-
self from prejudice of all kinds, to
surrender your ﬁxed ideas, and to
put your treasured convictions to the
test of facts, in a word, to discuss
this problem of causes of this lack
with an open mind.

When a freshman enters State he
comes with the idea of the big things
he is to do for his college. He comes
with the fixed conviction of being: a

 

men have discovered the fact already.

The Upper classmen, or so-called
Upper classmen do all in their power
to kill the “ Spirit " In the fi'osh. It
is their duty to foster the ideas of
the freshmen and help them grow
into the stages of the reality, instead
of drowning them in an overflow of

School Spirit is buried in an ovcr~
flow of so—ealleil class Rivalry. Class
Rivalry should give birth to School
Spirit and not kill it. [t is up to the
Upper classmen and the Sophomore.
What are you going to do about it?

GUILD 0F ORGANISTS HOLD
MEETING AT COLLEGE

'l‘he guild of organists of which Dr.
Thompson is the Dean, met at col-
lege Wednesday evening, November
l. The members were quests of Dr.
Thompson on that evening; and en-
joyed refreshments in the college
cafeteria. Plans were made for a
program for the work of the year.
There is to be a recital some time in
December. A deﬁnite date has not
been set. An investigation is being:
made of the history of church music,
organs, organists and choirs of all
the different churches of the capital
district. A history will be written
which will be most interesting and
which will instruct in the rise and
development of church music.

CHEMISTRY CLUB

At a meeting of the Chemistry
Club, Friday, November 3, Queenc
Homan explained to us the attempt
to utilize garbage. Experiments have
been performed which show that by
adding; creosote and coal dust to
street sweepinp's we get a very good

according to Mr. Childs' original
plan. Mr. Douglas pointed out some
of the deﬁnite reasons which have
helped to make the restaurants fam-
ous. For example, he said that the
waitresses were organized into a class
in which they are carefully informed
about the rules of waiting on table.
Each waitress is an intelligent, high
type of girl to whom courtesy is not
on unknown virtue. Mr. Douglas
said that rig-ht here was a line oppor-
tunity for a Home Economics girl to
enter into the field of restaurant
iiianauement. He spoke further of
the extensive plans, which are in
operation, to change the color scheme
of the restaurants from a pure white
to a bull' color. More changes are
now being: made to educate the pub-
lic as to the right kind of food to
rent. Mr. Douglas took the last few
minutes of his time to answer any
questions which came up.

Miss Gillett, who in her series of
talks has taken the students with her
through the European home, con-
tinued her lecture, telling at this
‘weck’s meeting; of German life. Miss
‘Gillett supplemented her talk 'with
'pictures and other illustrations.
