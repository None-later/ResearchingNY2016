IPSE DIXIT
and GALILEO

There was much learning but
little real knowledge in Galileo’s
time (1564-1642). Aristotle was
swallowed in bad Latin transla-
tions. Ipsedixit. Noonechecked
him by what seemed vulgar,
coarse experiment.

Galileo fought against the
dead hand of tradition. He did
not argue about Aristotle, but

at him to the test. Aristotle led

is readers to believe that of two
bodies the heavier will fall the
faster. Galileo simply climbed
to the top of the Leaning Tower
of Pisa and dropped two un-
equal weights. The “best peo-
ple” were horriﬁed; they _even
refused to believe the result—
that the weights reached the
ground in equal times.

‘.‘ Look at the world, and ex-
periment, experiment,” cried

Galileo.
The biggest man in the 16th

General.

 

century was not Galileo in pop-
ular estimation, but Suleiman
the Magniﬁcent, the Ottoman
Emperor, who swept through
Eastern Europe with ﬁre and
sword and almost captured
Vienna. Where is his magniﬁ-
cence now?

Galileo gave. us science—
established the paramount
right ,of experimental evidence.
Suleiman did little to help the
world.

Hardly an experiment is made
in modern science, whichdoes
not apply Galileo’s results.
When, for instance, the physic-
ists in the Research Laboratories
of the General Electric Company
study the motions of electrons
inrariﬁed atmospheres,or exper-
iment to heighten the efﬁciency
of generators and motors, they
follow Galileo's example and
substitute facts for beliefs.
