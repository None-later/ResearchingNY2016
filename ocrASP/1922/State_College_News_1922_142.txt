forbidden, indeed, it will not be
dictated to in negatives. Snid Dr.
Clause-n, “We are fools if we nag.
it is our duty to translate negatives
into affirmatives which will satisfy
the demands of Twenty-one.”

Life, not death is what youth is
interested in. The religion of life
and enthusiasm will appeal to youth
il' rightly presented, but the hideous-
ness of death, regarded too piously,
it can not understand and will not
. respond to.

Twenty-one can find in Christ
the only answer to its demand for
‘i'lrul‘less enthusiasm. He came to a
world of negatives which he answered
ed by saying, “Thou shalt love God.
Thou shalt love thy l'ellowmen." in
Christ there is undying youth. He
spoke youth’s language and faced
its problems with all the enthusiasm
of ’l‘wenty-one. ln him can Twenty-
one ﬁnd the answer to all questions.
He belongs to youth.

Dr. Clausen, after his talk,
answered several questions which
cleared vague doubts in the minds of
many of the students. llis very
personality seemed to inspire his
listeners who left the meeting, wish-
ing that they might have the good
fortune of hearing him again.
