Dr. Deporte Speaks on Russia

RUSSIAN ART STRESSED

 

Dr. Deporte addressed the Political
Science Club at its regular meeting,
Wednesday, November 8. His sub~
,iect was “ Russia in Europe.”

In answer to questions put by the
students, ,Dr. Deporte ﬁrst talked in-
formally .on Russia's government,
past and present. Before the World
War the government, like that of
Turkey, was an absolute monarchy, in
which the people had no voice. As
early as 1812, after the invasion and
subsequent defeat of Napoleon, there
began to be a change in Russia.
Soon ()IIieersw ol‘ the army, the edu-
cated class, were sent to Western
Europe to study various types of
government. They returned with
lofty, yet perverted ideas of estab~
Iishing' a democracized monarchy in
which they hoped to realize the bene-
ﬁts and escape the evils of the

lState Has 25 Men Trying

5 Out for Varsity Basketball

EFIRST CLASS FIVE EXPECTED

Basketball for the last ten years
has been a major sport at State and
at one time the college was repre-
sented by one of the strongest col-
l,lep‘e lives in the state. Marty Barry,
Stanley, li‘itze'erald and his brother
Francis, Edward Spring-man and
‘and Van Lehdell composed a stellar
quintet just before the war.

Since the war men have been
scarce at State and only last year
was any great increase in the num-
ln-r noted. This year it is even
greater, and with a squad of twenty-
live nu-n from which to pick a first
squad of ten men Coach Snavely ex-
[n-cts to lIilVU one of his best court
teams in the last iivu years.

Manager Robert C. It. Mach‘arlane

:has booked basketball games with
jCole-nte University, Union College
land St. Lawrence University as the
chief attractions at Albany. A trip
to New York City will he made early
in January. when teams representing;
[Pratt Institute and other second-class
jeollea'e court teams will be played.
2 With the exception of Captain
\drian Johnson, who has taken up
luties as a school principal at
Schenectady, last year’s varsity court
ﬁve remains intact. But none except
Edward Sherley, recently elected
captain to succeed Johnson, is sure
of a steady birth on the teams be-
cause ol' the competition olTered by
the freshmen.

From present indications John
Gainer, a newcomer, will likely give
Floyd “Slim” Landon a good battle
for the varsity center berth. All
other positions will be similarly con—
,tested between the twenty-ﬁve mem-
bers ol.‘ the squad. Herbert H.
Hornung and .William Breslaw, sopho-
mores, are again out for the forward
positions, and Edwin Juckett and
Charley Reilly for the guard berths.

‘ DeWitt Christy, star guard on the
lMilne Iliin School live for three
lyears, looms as a most probable
1selection fora e'uard berth. Benson
lHowe is also showing- good form in
lpreliminary practice at either for-
.‘ward or guard, while Warren Daley,
,a junior who played two games last
lyear, has reported for a forward or
‘n'uard choice. -

, Other members of the squad in-
.‘clude C. H. Cole, Ii. C R. McFar-
1lane. Ralph A. Beaver, Frank J.
IMcMahon, Harold Ferguson, Harry
jltude, J. 12). Smith, Robert Nolan,
zJaeob Braun, George Iiershaw, Ul-
rich Newner, Ernest Wagner, Henry
Cussh'r, and 'l‘heodore Hooker.
