[:BEEIERZ _____ 
THE NOVEMBER QUARTERLY

.The November issue of the Quar-
QarIy maintains the standard‘of exce
Ience which has brought this maga-
zine praise in the past. We trust the
contest announced in the number will
remedy the publication’s most rious
fault by making it more representa—
tive of the college as a whole. One
step toward the accon‘rpllshmem. oi
this ideal has been taken by the cre-
ation of the editorial section The
Merry Roz.

Twenty-two is grateful for the
Quarterly's reminiscent mood which
led it to present the baccalaureate
sermon and the class poem.

The other poems are varied in con-
tent and quality, although Nature has
not the tilt and freedom from forch
rhyme which should characterize a
joyful lyric, Down and Up possesses
dainty, whimsical charm. Poplar:
and The Derrick in the Oil Field seem
amateur. one, because of its obvious
second stanza, the other because of
its mixed hopes. Before the Storm
is a poem with a salt sea tang and a
vigorous sincerity. This same sin«
cerity we ﬁnd in ltuth Moore's prose
and are glad that she will relate more
Wild nec ates.

White Leghorn: and Pumpkin Pics
and Wild Honey are as delectable in
prose as in reality. The form
characterizations in the ﬁrst make us
think of Hamlin Garland’s Ma and
Ethel Ripley. Author of A Per-
verted Sense of Humor, your humor
is not so badly wrong side up as you
believe, else you could not smile so
genuinely at yourself.

Do you approve of the project
method of teaching? Have you ever
read that conglomeration of sounds
called the Congo, written by Lindsay?
Did you think This Freedom true to
life? Is Babbit better than Main
Street?

Some of these questions may be
answered by reading the section
headed Book Reviews, and others by
reading the books listed in this num-
ber which are recent acquirements of
our college library.

STUDENT ASSEMBLY

’I‘wo matters of importance to the
entire student body were brought up
in student assembly Friday, Novem-
ber 10.

The ﬁrst was concerned with the
refunding of student tax to students

semester or the early part ol‘ the see

Board called to the attention of the
students the fact that should there be
much refunding the amiropriations
[or the various student activities

ﬁnally decided by almost unanimous
vote that (me-hall" the student tax,
minus the tax for inlirmary fund

left before or at mid-years.

slight knowledge of French, attempts
to order a dinner in a French restau-
rant. The waitress, Dorothy Bennit,
shows her amusement at the cus~
tomers struggle and stupidity, and
invariably produces the wrong article
of food. This pantomime gives us a
sample of the very interesting pro-
grams that are being planned for this

with other members, and most of all
to come and enjoy themselves.
