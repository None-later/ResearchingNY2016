DR. DEPORTE SPEAKS 0N
RUSSIA . ‘

(Continued from page 1)
Their
lirst attempt at reform was the abo-
lition of slavery. These slaves, by
the way, were not of a dilI‘erent race
or nation, but white and Russian. In
this way the seeds of revolution were
sown, and by the class which was to
sun‘er most when the red flag was
raised years later. In 1905 an un-
successful revolution broke out and
this was followed by extreme depres-
sion. At the beg-inning of the World
War, therefore, Russia was in a terri-
ble condition, and the soldiers who
must defend their country were
wretchedly equipped. Russia's [ral—
lant part in this War, while she was
eiIective, is well known as is also the
[act of her revolution in 1917 and
the suil'ering‘ and desolation caused
by the ascendency of the Bolsheviki.
Russia’s motives, or rather the
motives of her true leaders, are high
and noble enough, and even the B01-
sheviki are not as black as some of
us have been led to believe. Still,
conditions are as they are, for the
people, starved for years, are too
weak physically to resist, even
though they are extremely dissatis-
lied with the present government.

The Russians have the accepted
European idea of the Americans.
’l‘hey regard as as people uninter-
ested in art, and chiefly concerned in
practical thing's, money getting in
particular. 'l‘hcy fully appreciate
what America did in [892, and what
she is now doing to relieve the food
situation. There is also almost an
aﬂ’ection between America and Rus-
sia, dating back, perhaps, to the Civil
War, when Russia surprised the
world by sending; her fleet to visit
New York. Still the Russians are
surprised at the- childlshness of
America, as shown by the noisy en-
thusiasm she exhibited at her football
and baseball games.

The Russian children are very
different from the American children,
for their outlook has been influenced
by things of which the American
child is entirely ignorant. Under
such abnormal conditions the child~
ren too, cannot help but be ab~
normal. They are much older'in
their actions, and students of sixteen
and seventeen are the power and
leading inﬂuence in Russia.

Again and again Western Europe
and America have been astonished by
the art Russia has produced. For
somehow they still consider Russia

I lean back in my chair,

And I think, and I think;

And I wonder if I’ll ever know

The wheres and the whens and the
whats of the world,

And the why's of its beinp; just so.

Now when you are sure

You've settled a what

And you cant remember just Where,

You throw up your hands in righteous
disgust,

And say, “I don't know as I care."

But that doesn’t tell you

The why of the what,

Orvthe whenncss of its being where,

So you settle right down to think it
all out;

But when do you chr get there?

Then think right along
To your own hearts content.
While I puzzle awhile on a why;
And when you’re sure of what, when,
where, whyness of things,
The log-ician will only say, ” Fie.”

the committee also discussed the
progress of the negotiations which
they are now carrying; on in refer-
ence to a possible site for the dor-
mitory itself. Report was made that
the senior class campaign had already
begun. Up to date their pledge
amounts to $7,500 from 76 seniors,

seniors for the co-operation they
have given and the college spirit
they have shown.

The greatest violinist and the second
greatest pianist of today are Rus-
sians. The actors and actresses of
Russia are famed throughout the
world, for a company of Russian
actors is a company of artists, each
equally great. There are many rep-
resentatives of Russian art now in
America. Dr. Dcporte closed his
talk by urging all who could to attend
the wonderful Russian play which
will be presented in New York some-

 

time m January.
