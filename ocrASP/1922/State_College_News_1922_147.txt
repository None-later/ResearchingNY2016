Brings St. Stephen’s
Victory

STATE UNABLiTTFSTOP PASSES

 

State went to Anandale Saturday
with high hopes of victory, but they
met an eleven whose fast passing
they Were unable to stop, in spite of
a hard and clean fought battle.

in each of the first two periods St.
Stephen’s scored four touchdowns,
but State was unable to score. Dur—
ing the intermission State woke l l
and the lteds curried no more p.’i“cs
across the line. State’s fumbles cost
her a number of scores and opened
up the way for St. Stephen's. ’l‘he
swift, hairvraising passing of the full
blooded lndian warrior, Deloria,
practically won the day for the
“ Rectors.”

Christie and Crane put up a game
defense, but tl y were unable to keep

 

 

   

back the pa ol' the St. Stephen’s
eleven. State's line work was

splendid. Not once could St. Steph-
ens gain on rushes. Hayes pushed
back the opposing team again and
again. Smith and Howard played
their regular strong games.

Juckett and Hornung, who were
working the ends kept back most of
the plays in their territory.

The backﬁeld was a bit weak in
the ﬁrst half, but bucked up diring
the second. The tackling was much
better than at the beginning of the
season, and the game was a hard
light to the ﬁnish.

Christie and Smith were taken out
during the game on account of in—
juries and State thereby lost two hard
ﬁghting men.

Banquet and Stunt: Feature

 

With an attendance of ilii per cent
of its umlergradunte members as
well as several alumni the Chemistry
Club staged its annual initiation party
on Wednesday afternoon. The ail'air
opened with a club song followed by
a few stunts. The initiates then
served supper to the club members
and then entertained them by stunts
and contests. The two biggest bits
of the evening were Harvey lt‘enner,
dressed as a colored boy, telling the
story of “ Goldy l.oeks:” and Muriel
Dagget, dressed as a colored girl,
singing a truly negro spiritual with
the characteristic slides. ’l‘here were
athletic dancers, impersonators and
other specimens more viewable than
describable, who performed with vim.
’l‘he initiates were then served supper
the club members. When they
were sufliciently nourished with soup,
ham. salad, cake, and ice cream they
pledged their loyalty to the club by
repeating the sacred oath after the
president. The constitution was then
signed by the new membersz—Hen—

Dramatic and Art Association
To Present Gerrit Beneker
SUBJECT TB—BEMRT AND

lNDUSTRY "

Under the auspices of the Dra-
matic and Art Association, on Tues
day, November 28, State College Will
have the opportunity of hearing Mr.
Gerrit Beneker at Chancellor’s Hall.
He will give an illustrated lecture on
“Art and industry.”

. Mr. Beneker is an artist of that
class in which the world of today is
apt to put most struggling artists who
truly pursue art—the? seeker after
an ideal who will not produce work
without an underlying inspiration.
The respect, howm'er, in which Mr.
llem-ker diil‘ers from most of those
in this class, is that he has made the
world recognize his work. He is one
of those rare persons who combines
success in commercial art and the
highest art ideals. He puts not only
his personality into all that he does
but also the personality of his model.

 

Every one of his posters “tells a
story ;” a story of industry, of labor,
of the lives of those hard-working
men who are building the material
foundation of nations.

it was during the war that Mr.
Benckcr‘s work first came before the
public. His typical “Sure we’ll finlsll
the job ” poster became known
throughout the country. of all the
wartime artists, Mr. Bencker stands
at the head of the list of those who
sought ,to interpret the laboring class
in a true and symfpathetic manner.

In 11 Cleveland actory, where Mr.
Benekcr has his studio, is Peggy
Hirsch. the typical and favorite
Bcneker model. It is in this factory
that Mr. Bencker finds most of his

the men, not as workmen, but as men,
