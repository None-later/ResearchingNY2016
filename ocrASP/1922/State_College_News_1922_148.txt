A CHANCE FOR ’23

Ever senior haslbcen asked to wear
his or or cap and gown to chapel on
Friday mornin . Whether this shall
become a trad tion depends entirely
upon the action of '23. The present
senior class can set an example for
future classes to follow if it has
every member conforming to the new
idea. But it only has to take a half-
hearted interest, and the proposed
plan will die an early death.

The seniors have.a great oppor-
tunity to start something that shall
last as long as State College itself.
Other classes have set customs that
have become traditions with the pass-
ing oftime. They have become
monuments to those classes. The
“News ”. stands as a monument for
’18, its founder. The orchestra con-
tinually honors ’21. the class that
made its existence possible. Here is
an opportunity for ’23. What is she
going to do about it?

 

IN THE LOCKER
ROOMS

Upon seeing us rushing and push—
ing about in the locker rooms during
lunch hour, a chance observer might
well liken us to a pack of noisy geese.
Such cries as these are characteristic:
“Someone’s stepped on my foot;"
“Hurry up;” “ We'll have to stand
here all day-,” " Move along;" “I'll
never make that 12:15 at the rate
we’re going." And thus the talk
runs up and down the line.

We cannot wait. We shuﬂic from
one foot to the other. accidently
shove our neighbor, or, extremely im-
patient, hecdless of everything and
everyone, we attempt to push ahead
only to collide with some over-
burdened person. Perhaps we say
we are sorry, but in the doing We
manage to clash into another un-
fortunate victim; Thereby the whole
process is subject'to repetition.

STATE COLLEGE

TO THE STUDENTS
The article of two weeks ago pub-
lished in this paper obtained t e re-
sult for which it was intended. There
is some "‘ Spirit ” in cvory college.
If there was not there would he no
college. The “ Spirit " had been
laying dormant in State and it needed
to be awakened. have found in
my former school life that the best
way to make poo lo show their
"Spirit," was to tcl them they had
none. I think it attained results.
Let’s keep the good work up.
good many of our people must have
read their papers before chapel last
week. The cheering practice in
chapel could not be improved upon
without ,quite a little practice, some-
thing I hope we get more time for in
the uture than we haVc in the past.
I felt, fellow students, that the
article of two weeks age should be
written. I hated to be the one to do
the nasty trick. I knew that some of
the students would do just what they
did do, look at it as'thoutrh (as
someone expressed it) that I was
taking my toys and going home.
Such a. thing,r as that would make me
fight for your conﬁdence mor- than
anything else could do. I am sorry
that some of the students did that.
but I suppose it was the most natural
thing to do, and we humans always
follow the line of lease resistance.
The " Spirit " is awakened now and
I hope that we are able to keep it
so. Let’s do our best.
~J. J. Lulor, ’26.

 

 

 

 

COLLEGE SPIRIT

As the football season draws to a
close we again begin to hear about
basketball. For the older students
this causos an amused and cynical
smile and some such comments as
these: “ S-t-a-t-e means victory!
Good joke,” or ” Yes, State is on a
par with Yale. nave" won a name last
year.” Is this Colleen Spirit? if
so, then ’26 has a right to attack it.
College Spirit is not something- frat:-
ile, to be carefully put. away and
brought out only on special occas-
ions, but it is something to be show1
at all times, in defeat as well as in
victory. Certainly it is as encourag-
ing to play before empty, silent
bleachers as it is to address rows of
empty seats or to sing to a noisy
chattering crowd. Let’s do a little
encouraging! When the class games
start, '26 can show her class spirit,
and a ﬁne outlet for the dammed up
sophomore-freshman rivalry will be
provided. Let's start now and learn
our basketball songs and cheers.
Then let’s go to every game and yell
ourselves hoarse, and show ’26,. our-
selves, and everyone else that we
have College Spirit. Let's make
S—t-a-t-e mean Victory!

 

At last we have reached our rc-
spcctivo lockers. Because we have
paid the sum of twenty-ﬁve cents for
their use, have we not the privilege
of scattering our books and other
parphernalia over the door? The
other fellow can get by as best he
can. But woe unto him if he dis-
turbs one of our precious books! We
are so egotistic that we cannot realize
that we, too, are greedy geese.

After we have carried on a lengthy
conversation with one or two others
in the same row about our math. or
history problems, we leisurely collect
our belongings from the floor, and
proceed to eat our lunches in the

 

vicinity of our lockers.
“Oh, well. I’m not in unyono's

NEWS, NOVEMBER 24. I922

END OF INTERCLASS RIVALRY

intorcluss rivalry between the
‘ .‘ i, and Freshman classes is
over, at least for the prosont. Mys~
kania at the instigation of President
Brubachcr, read to the assembled
Sophomores and Freshman classes a
decree forbidding inter-class rivalry
as it has previously been carried on
and announcing that it. less strenu-
ous form would be suggested some-
time after Christmas. What do the
classes think of it? There are ex~
cited discussions on both sides. Who

if we of the class of ’25 are for-
bidden to do it, or what use is thL
destructive rivalry which we’ve had
previously? There are arguments to
be found in each case. But what
we should be chiefly concerned with
is that, now that Myskania in ac-
cordance with Dr. Brubacher has
asked, amt in fact, insisted that we
carry out this decree, there should be
no licsituncy. We must place college
spirit above cIaSs spirit. It’s the
unity of theI whole which makes the
college. Let's do our best to live up

hard it may be.

LOYALTY TO ALMA MATER

Are you loyal or disloyal to your
Alma Mater? Some one will disptito
that there is any need for discussion
upon the subject. But. I think that
there is. Of. course, the upper class-
men who have gone through the
struggles of being a freshman have
come to a fuller realization of the
pleasures and the responsibilities in
their work and they love their
college.

Some of us are coming- to College
from so great a distance that it is
impossible for us to get home as often
as we should like. We wish at times
that everything would fade away and
leave us standing: free and alone.
Others of us who commute feel that
we are not getting as much of col-
lege life as we should. We should
prefer g‘oinp: miles away to college in
or.lc:“to cxnericncc l? '13 away from
home. We are discourafred perhaps
because we are not progressing; as
we had hoped. Teaching does not
appeal so strongly to us and we pre-
fer to prepare ourselves for some
other profession. Also State College
may not brim: to some all that they
had dreamed a college life should be.

Come, let us forget our potty
grievances, our likes and dislikes, and
make the most of every minute that
we are at College. Let us remember
that State College means to us a col-
lege education and we owe her our
sincere love and loyalty.

| So there we stand in the way of
,other hustlers, roccivinp‘ now a jolt,
,now an insinuating “ lxcuse me,

l Luncheon disposed of, (we become
once more one of the pushing, jost-

way, but of course, we are in no one

privilege? I wonder did the other

upper halls become our goal, while
the locker rooms stand deserted.

EDISON ATTACKS MODERN
COLLEGES

 

Inventor Does Not Think They Are
What They Should Be.
Princeton, N. .l., Nov. 18.—-—'l‘liomas
A. Edison does not think modern col-
leges are what they should be. He
disapproves of the present day col-
lege graduate and is of the opinion
that a college graduate objects to
work, especially if it. is dirty.
llin viuv.".. r/fric'i have caused a
furor among," faculty and undergrad-
uutcs of Princeton, were obtained ill
iin interview be granted to the Daily
Princetoniun.
“ Take the average college man, ”

said Edison, “His knowledge of his"

surroundings and environment is
usually inadequate. What young-
mon need is a broad trenerul under-
standing- of every little thing; in life,
such as would fit; them to be able to
answer my questionnaire.

“ It" It college man gets a position,
he expects to be appointed foreman
at; the end of the sixth week. Most
the men working; for me have
never gone to college. 'l‘hosc college
graduates i have, have usually shown
a lack of imagination.

“They scarcely have any sugges-
tions to make in their daily routine.
which might lead to improvement in
their various departments. '

“ There are plenty of openings l'or'

ambitious men in this country. Why
is it that we have so few $i0,000 a
year men? [t is not that there is a
lack of such positions, but 'zitho.‘
that there is a scarcity of men of
sufficient caliber to fill these open-
ings.

“l have found out. that whatever
a man is during- the first six weeks
after he gets a. job, he will be the
same after sixty years.

“The main quality for success, in

vmy estimation, is ambition with a

will to work. "
