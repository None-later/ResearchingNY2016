COACH SNAVELY EXPLAINS
CHANGES IN BASKETBALL
, ' RULES

i m .
,I'mporlnnt Change: In Rules

’l‘he first change that will be noted
by the spectators this year is in the
marking of the court. The I'oul lines
(free throw lines) are continum
entirely across the floor at each end.
The floor space between this line and
the end of the court is knoivn as the
tool zone,.,, When the defense
commits a personal ton! in the goal
zone, their opponents are giVen two
free throws regardless of whether or
nththe player was i‘oulcd while
attempting to shoot.

The second change of importance
is the elimination of many technical
fouls. instead of calling a technical
foul when a player runs with the
ball, drops his hand while jumping,
or~"h‘m‘ps‘ ’Out of the ring, the OIl'icals
wil now. call a violation and give the
halite tic opposing.tenm at the
neare'st’siiie line.

A third change is one affecting
substitutions. Incoming substitutes
may not communicate with the other
players before play again commene

The rules are positive this year
instead of negative or even indiffer-
ent as in the past. ’l‘hey are a big
improvement over last year’s set.
The game as. a result will be cleaner
and faster than ever before.
FRESHMAN GIRLSi OUT FOR

CHAMPIONSHIP

From the spirit and zest of the
candidates who are turning out for
p ‘acticc, the basketball season looks
bright for the I‘reslnnen girls. Who
can wonder at their high hopes i'or
the championship when she learns
that the captain of the team played
center last year for Renssciacr High,
the 's‘cHOol which carried off the
Eastern League honors, and that the
two best forwards, despite their
youthi'ulness, are quick and deft,
excellent in passwork and in sheet-
ing, while the guards are as they
should be: tall, large and formidable.

’I‘he Freshman Class can look for-
ward to the coming conflict not only
with confidence in the skill of their
team but also with pride in their
good sportsmanship.'

’ 26 caution the upper classmen to
beware of their dignity and honor
and warn the sophomores to antici-
pate the approaching day, November
22, with fear and trembling!

REFLECTION.
’I‘he freshman tumbled into bed,
"Another day is done! ” she said.
ut scarcely had she closed her eyes,
’I‘hen she decided otherwise.
“Tomorrow I have History 2,
What next will ‘ Itis' ask me to do?
Study the Normans and the Danes,
Know all the kings and their domains,
Review the history of France
'l‘ake fourteen centuries in advance.
An English them:- ‘I must prepare;
Go to sleep—why i just don’t dare!
I’m sure I wouldn’t wake on time,
And that would be an awful crime.
Yet I must have my eight hours sleep
If I my health record would map.
And there’s my math. I do not know,
But to that class i have to go.
The Devil's Collin sure is deep,
Oh! can I ever go get to sl "
My French I simply must go through
01' I will get a billet doux.
Prof. Woodard’s sure to call on me
For something in biology.”
And then at. last she went to sleep,
Just as the birds began to peep.
Four year of this will spell her doom.
Will someone please put on her tomb:
“Herc lies the girl who thought she

and

n

 

 

woud
Do ALI. the profs. said that she
should!” ——Edna Layton, ’26
