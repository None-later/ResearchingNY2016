CIVIL WAR

January 30

As the junior ediloi's 0f the
"hows" are working their heads
off on this issui- of the paper, the
seniors are sitting peacefully by
watching aml .‘ hie—occasion-
ally. By way of cheering them up
and giving them a little added iii-
spiration the senior editors would
like to say that they apprei tie the
cooperation and interest that the
juniors have, shown in the publica-
tion of the “News” so far. and that
they wish them lurk in issuing the
Junior number. The seniors feel
that the paper will undoubtedly be
very good this week, but they
know that it “couldn't” come up to
the usual standard of the previous
weeks. lleie's to the juniors! !

Junior Note—The above com—
ment can be better understood
when it is known that the Senior
lioard contributed the mater ll.

As the coming week end is de-
voted to junior exploits, it might
be well to attempt a definition of
the term “lolly Juniors." “"0 do
not, of course. votieli for the (icon:
racy of our definition, it is not
done in exam week.

person who has experienced the
ups and downs of college life, and

So he think‘ at lens. lle

psych to the full~of
course. he does not admit he used
to laugh in the wrong places; he is
now sleeping peacefully in Ed 1,
and dreaming blissfully of his
brilliant future among the Milne
high seraphs.

Our‘juniors are jolly. They have
to be to succeed. There, are profs
to jolly; freshmen to jolly; and,
last. but not least, themselves to
jolly along. Jolly carries with it
the idea of good fellowship. 800d

true perseverance, might we not
turn our attention to our fresh-men.

val of waiting with nothing to do

STUDENT FORUM

The practice of havingr student
forums in Assembly has been
started at State tlollcge this year.
The purpose of the forum is to
train students in public speaking.
After they leave college. students
will often be called upon to make
speeches on different questions.
The .work of the English depart-
ment is valuable in this respect but
does not develop the same ability
as the actual experience obtained
in a free disci sion of this kind.

The questions which will be
talked upon will be either of local
interest, such as the Honor Sys-
tem, to l)t‘ discussed next time, or
tiurrent l‘ivents, such as the Dis-
armament (.Ionicrcnce. the subject
of the last forum

it is hoped that a true expression
of Sltltlelit opinion will he devel-
oped in the consideration of col—
lege problems. Informal speeches
of this kind, if carried out as ex-
pected, ought to tLlYt' a clearer and
more complete idea about what the
student body really wants than the
present system of decidingr college
' liveryonc must take
part in niakiin.r llli' forum a success
or ibis aim will not be realized.

The discussion of public (pier-
iions should slimiilalr (til iIiIervst
in national and intrrimtional af-
fairs. it is often said that there
are few .\llltlL‘llls outside the his-
tory department who have any
ndiiit; of these Apro‘nletiist
llere s an opportunity for us all
to broaden our knowlrdue of world
al‘faiis. To eel the greatest benefit
from this work some time must he
spent on the study of the topics,
but the subjects are given out some
time in advance and material on
them is placed in the library.

.\l the first forum. on the Dis-
armament ('onfercuc two
speakers were elected to sp ik five
minute. each, and there \vrre sev-
eral speeches from the floor. it
was felt that this method did not
give opportunity for enough people
to talk. ;\t the next forum. which
will be on l’i-liruary l7, the entire
tiilie will be given over io open and
informal disci of information
upon llle 4uliject of the Honor
System can be obtained at the (fol-
L Library and the State Library.
There arr some students who
have attended colleges and unive
sitics where the Honor System ‘
followed. Their first hand infor-
mation should he of more weight
than that acquired from reading.

The publi‘ speating and current
events class 5 take up the different
subject» of the student forum and
have (‘1; swork on them. The
whole student body should come
to assembly prepared to talk and
the studeni forum will become a
strong factor in State College life.

INTELLECTUALITY

The true test of our intellectual-
ity i., after all, our ability to ex-
press ourselves, either through the
medium of speech or that of writs
ten material. This was an idea
heard in class recently. After con-

 

A FABLE—BY AESOP, JR.

Once upon a time in the land of
loan ago, there was a maiden whom
the gods had favored with beauty
to please the race of man. And
this maiden was so admired that
she became vaiii and wished to be
still more beautiful.

tine year there was to be a great
festival for the. young men and
maidens in the sacred grove. [\llt
each young man was to choose his
mate from the beautiful maidens in
the grave; and it was to be :1 Sign
when the flutes began to play. that
each man was to choose his mate
for the dance.

Now this beautiful maiden prev
pared for the (ltitll'e fora lone, long,r
time. She took rose petals and
put lliein iii a Stone jar; and once
at change of moon, she ground the
petals between the palms of her
hands. in the Spring she. gath-
ered the blood-root llower and pre—
served its blood J\ll(l she put in a
stone jar the juice of the black-
berry. And when the festival time
came, she arrayed herself in her
most beautiful gown: and she took
the powder of the rose petals and
rubbed it on her face so that it
would be soft and scented. Then
she took the juice of the hen iiid
stained her brows rind lashes that

 

 

they might be dark; and she
stained her lips and checks with
the blood of the flower.

And she went forth to [lie festi'
val and stood in a high place where
all men might see her beauly. And
the other maidens in lowly places
were silent as the lliites began to
play: but the beautiful maiden
stretched oiit lic‘ arms, and leaned
toward the young men, singing.
"Choose me for the dance; choose
me for a mate. i am beautiful;
choose me." One by one the
lovely maidens were chosen by
their mates, and beauty alone was
left on her pedestal. All alone she
\\'-'lS through the dance, and then
the young men and maidens
wandered together tliroiinh the
5. ‘red grove. Whereat the beauti—
ful maiden lifted high ln-r llt'll(l. but
the red stain was faded in one spot
by :i lear.

Then the gods smiled, and rail-
in},r her to Olympus, tt'ttvc her her

      

reward of life: "Let her alw m
beautiful: let her be always llttlitir
than the other immortals; and let

her always sine, ’(‘lioose me:' and
let young men forever be in her
Sltflll-—-ltlll with their ha
toward her.” And the 3 I .

inn opposite her name in the book
of men. found a new word and
wrote, beuinninu: "Shi- iliat

together very true and at least to
us, it little startling. We think that
it may strike you the same way i

Then perhaps the condition can be
remedied.
I The college song's that are sung
in chapel are, in most cases, pitched
so high that very few male voices
can get up to them without a step—

in college is so small that it can be
counted on the lingers of one hand
For other men than these the high
notes are impossible, The out-

t'an’t you girls reali‘xc that the
three score or more of llilSSt‘\ and

the left side of the auditorium
