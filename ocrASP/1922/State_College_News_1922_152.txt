on “Art and Industry." Mr. en-
eker‘s talk was most informal. He
was so interesting in his subject that
he made his audience feel as he did
toward the honest, grimey, toilers he
so charmingly painted. He made
them understand the psychology of
poster-making,—that something which
appeals to the deeper emotions of
mankind rather than to the super-
ﬁcial, passing fancy. He showed that
art, employed for an humanizing end,
such as rucol‘dlnp; the personalities
and lives of every-day laymen, is just
as much art as the statue of a beauti-
ful woman.

tory. The slides of his own pictures
and posters, which he showed, were
the more facinating', magniﬁed to the
size of the screen. His painted peo-
ple made an appeal of their own.
Mr. Beneker ended his talk by mak-
ing an earnest plea for sympathy,
understanding: and cooperation be-
tween the world at large and those

SUBJECT I5 “CLASS RIVALRY"
In view of the fact that there has
been so much agitation and talk
about college these last few weeks
over class rivalry and the acts as-
cribed to its influence, Dr. Bru
bachcrs talk on Class Rivalry and
College Spirit was welcomed in Stu-
dent Assembly Friday, November 24.
Dr. Brubacher stated that person-
ally hc was neutral that freshmen
and sophomores look alike to him,
but that events leading up to last
Friday morning could not be ignored,
and that it seemed necessary to dis-
cuss, in an intimate manner, what
constitutes class rivalry and in what
way it is related to class spirit.
There were three main reu
why these rivalries this year could
not be ignored.
1. Their interference with ordin-
ary recitation periods.
2. Their resulting: restriction of
freedom of a member of the faculty.
3. The destruction of college prop-
erty. ~
Since we are the custodians of this
property, we surely can not have the
rig-ht to injure it.
Dr. Brubacher realized a halt must
come, and so he appealed to the
seniors and to Myskania. The result
was the request that class rivalry be
suspended for the present while an
inventory might be taken.
‘ It seems,” stated Dr. Brubacker,
“that there are various delusions.
The first, is that class spirit will build
