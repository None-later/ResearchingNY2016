Plans were made to arouse
the interest of those unfortunate
people who do not know what a glor-
ious place Silver Bay is. After the
meeting we sang: the songs we learned

girls, was at Silver Bay and popped corn over

the log fire. We were all glad that
Miss Scotland and Miss Rice, both
loyal “ deles " could be with us and
we hope they will come again. We
are also hoping that at our next meet-
ing we may have more 01' the people
who have been at Y. W.‘ conferences
at Silver Bay. We want you to share
our good times.

pletely to l‘orm water and nothing

proved that natural and artiﬁcial
carbonates of copper are always
constant in con‘iposition.

"There must be some law in
this," reasoned Dalton (1766-
1844), the Quaker mathematician
and school teacher. That law he
proceeded to discover by weighing
and measuring. He found that each
element has a combining weight
of its own. To explain this, he
evolved his atomic theory—the
atoms of each element are all
alike in size and weight; hence
a combination can occur only in
deﬁnite proportions.

Dalton’s theory was published
in 1808. In that same year, Na-

   

General

 

poleon made his brother, Joseph,
king of Spain. This was considered
a political event of tremendous
importance. But Joseph left no
lasting impression, while Dalton,
by his discovery, elevated chem-
istry from a mass of unclassiﬁed
observations and recipes into a
science.

Modern scientists have gone be.
yond Dalton. They have found
the atom to be composed of elec-
trons, minute electrical particles.
In the Research Laboratories of
the General ElectricCompany
much has been done to make this
theory practically applicable so
that chemists can actuallypredict
