be a rivalry of boys versus boys and
girls versus irl .' v

Then Dr. rubacher made the sug-
gestion that a committee representing
the three upper classes be appointed
to stud the situation and to formu-
late ru as under which freshmen and
sophomores may live together with
rivalry certainly— but a rivalry
modified in some forms.

" The first purpose of class rivalry
is to produce class solidity. It is not
indispensible but it is highly desir-
able that there be a class spirit. It is
good for the freshmen to be denied
Certain privileges. There are certain
courtesies .. freshmen owa. to up er.
classmen. It is also highly desira in
that the freshmen be tau ht to lay
aside childish things, that t ey should
bd”ﬁi‘§piﬁﬁi"iﬁ an orderly way to
take their places in the co lege com-
munity. Under the old system, this
preparation centered around a group
of resisters, a thing which is not done
in a well behaVed college community.
The freshmen must be made to under-
stand that college is a place of work.
Such matters as have to do with

are properly desl ed for this and at
once set the fres men class by itself
and will thereby solidify it and teach
it the respect for coming dignities.

The penalties, of course. must be
put on a basis where freshmen will
see it as a wise thing to obey them;
but on such a basis a so that , if they
do not obey, they will not be
‘ spanked ' but rather ostracized and
denied the opportunities of leadership
that may be theirs, To have the
freshmen held in disrepute by the
uppernclasamen should be the punish-

As for college spirit, Dr. Brubacher
stated that hundreds of colleges have
good college spirit'—’ manifested by
the way in which it sings its Alma
Mater. There 'is nothing better on
which to build our college spirit than
on our Alma Mater. And this has
nothing to do with violence of any
kind, but it does have a lot to do with
our life here in the college commun-
ity. College life, like family life,
demands that if we can’t say anything

STATE COLLEGE NEWS. DECEMBER 8. l922

DRAMATICS CLASS PLAYS TO BE

PRESENTED IN JANUARY

‘ (Continued from page 1)
Frederick Fenn and Richard Pryce, is
a pathetic little drama rendered
amusing by Amanda’s air-castles and
cockney dialect. Six persons take
art in this play—"Manda," Orrin,
adame Celeste, Clem and Rose.
The third selection is The Mall-r of
Dreams, by phant Downs. It is
a delightful fantasy that has a repu-
tation for charm. The three charac-
ters of this play are the Manufac-
turer, Pierrot, and Plerret.

The selection of plays this year is
a particularly happy one, for they
give an o portunity for thirteen
actresses. The unluckiness of this
number- is offset by the fact that
there is one actor.) The Dramatics
class is unusually large this year and
competition for the diil‘erent charac—
ters is keen. The tryout for The
Maker of Dreams will take place on
Tuesday evening, December 5, for
Miss Tuuy on Wednesday after-
noon, December 6, and for ’Op-a-
nae-Thumb on Thursday evening, De-
cember 7. The announcement of the
results of the try-outs will be pub-
lished, if possible, in the next issue
of the News.
tops of the College News and yell how
rotten a place this is ” said Dr.
Brubacher in regard to the various
“mud slinging " articles that have
up cared lately.

r. Brubacher closed his talk with
the reminder that each of us was a
custodian of State College which we

were representing and with an offer ‘
of his schIces if, at any time, in any ‘

way, he could contribute to the

betterment of our undergraduate life. i
