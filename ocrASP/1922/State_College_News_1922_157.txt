A WORTHY APPEAL

At the Christmas season the promi-
nent that in the mind of mankind the
world over was one of getting. As
the yours went on the spirit of selfish-
ness passed and gave way to a finer
spirit of helpfulness. Getting has
given place to giving. We delight in
making gifts to our friends and neigh-
bors, most of whom are fortunate in
the possession of health and strength.

With the bells and tinsel of Christ-
mas time there comes an appeal that
cannot help but temper the boisterous
feeling that the season always brings.
It is the appeal to help the unfortu-
nates who lack that priceless jewel,
health. For them the joyousness of
others can only bring sadness. In
many cases shut up far from friends
and the homelife that brightens the
holiday season they must bear their
heavy burdens in silence. But the
voice of humanity has spoken. It
has appealed to our generosity. In
the most joyous time of the year
that voice, the Red Cross, asks for aid
for those stricken by the white plague.
The appeal comes to everyone who
has partaken of the beauties of life.
A worthy cause deserves a generous
response. ,Let everyone remember
the words of Him whose birth we
celebrate at the Christmas season,

of these, ye do unto Me." When
asked to help by buying Christmas
seals let us respond with the true
