of all things, ills is a faded glory,
a lost kingdom. i in whole
thought was of material things;
land. castles, money, aoldiers. llis
life's amhition left no place for the
depths of love; he thought of it as
merely an attraction helWeett the

ttttt'iilltu conscience. lieleu speaks
of the Slimline as the one who has
i>ren ever present to reveal the
shallowne" ol‘ her lite, the one
who has shattered her dreams.

all love is without Ira-dc reality or
the glory of a dream?

who are not alt-aid of facts, nor
unresponsive to the magic of
