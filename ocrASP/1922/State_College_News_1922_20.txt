JUST A COMMENT

We all know that as the athletics
of a college are branded so also, to
a large extent, is the college
branded. It is a good college to go
to, or it is absolutely out of con.-
s‘itlcration for the live, wide-awake,
sub-.frcsilmian, according as the
teams it sends forth into the inter-
collegiate field are winners or
losers, lighters or fusscrs. I '
necessity, therefore. whoever is m-
lcrested in the welfare of the col-
lege is interested in the promotion
of her athletics. In connection with
athletics, questions arise which can-
not he settled .ofthand. This is
especially true here at State, where
athlc‘rtics, the kind that advertise,
require that practically every man
in the college shall serve an active
bit, and yet are supported bnan-
oially by the women. l'lerc’s a
sample question, and a pertinent
one, too: Do the State College girls
want ﬁghters or fussers for the
money that they IllﬂVE invested in
athletics?

In this issue the reader will fund
a new column under the head of
Bachelor Badinage. 'l‘he contrib-
utors to this column will endeavor
to bring to the attention of the stir
dent body questions concerning
State College athletics, which is
almost equivalent to saying, ques-
tions which concern State College
men. The column will be open to
contributions. and its contents to
comment, either of which may or
may not be printed.

NEXT SEMESTER

Well, folks, here we are, all ready
for a new semester. The slate has
been washed clean. Let’s write
something worth while on it this
time. Of course, this is not meant
for those world-heaters who did
A work in everything, but rather to
{those who rated at B or bill: few
who were so unfortunate as to get
C. there were any who got D
or E, which did not mean ex

 

cellent, of course, we most humbly
ask them to lend a listening car
also.

We stand now at the beginning
of another lap in the chase of that
elusive article. Knowledge. Let
us start out witlh a rush and keep
going at high speed all along the
course. You know, folks. our profs
are great believers in the law of
averages. in other words, they
believe in what sporting men call
“dope.” For example, they lignre
that a student who gets it) this sem-
ester. will get C next semester, and
the next, ad infinitum. What we
are asking of you is that you help
us jar them loose from their smug
beliefs. Go at them so strongr that
they will have to throw away past
records and start to write the book
all over again. In other words,
let's stage a “como-back," or, as
Dantc might have said, “Lettus
fool 'em."

SENIORS GET FIRST
PLACE

:\t the post-exam jubilee last
\\'edncsday night the judges de-
cidcd that the senior stuul was the
best and lllilll lhe sophomores
should receive honorable mention.

Catherine l’cltz was chairman of
the Senior stunt committee and put
on a clever interpretation of a
senior practice teacher's life around
exam time. Catherine Drnry, with
h:r electric curlers and Education 2,
made everyone howl. 'l‘ircd out,
she goes to sleep, only to dream
of her .\lilne llig'h class that she
had to teach next morning. ller
Milne llig’h "ehcrnbs"'\vcre like
the real article, doing all of the
things that they do in everyday life.
In the midst of the uproar Prof.
Sayl‘cs in the form of Katherine
l'clll, and Katherine .\Icr rant, as
a sentimental snpcrintcmlcut in
Search of teachers, walked into the
room.

in spite of her confusion the su-
pcrinltendcnl was very much
pleased with her work and engaged
her. In the midst of all her hap-
piness she awoke to llll(l that her
alarm clock had not gone off and
that it was nearly time for the
fatal Ed. 2 exam.

BACHELOR BADINAGE

The Donkey and the Oyster

 

Among,r the various types of our
associates there are two which are
readily discernible — the donkey
and the oyster. The former type
we generally endure, because, while
we must admit that the braying
often becomes monotonous, we
nevertheless recognize that there is
considerable kick in every good
donkey. The latter type we prize
the more, because, in spite of the
fact that it is characteristically
close mouthed. there is disclosed,
when it can be persuaded to open
up, a really worth-while morsel, and
now amt then a pearl of some value.

 

A FABLE BY AESO'P, JR.

Once upon a time, in the land
of long ago, the king had a mighty
counsellor among this adv‘isors.
Now this counsellor was stricken
ill and died, wherczvt the king
mourned much. And he sc’ll‘chcd
for a new counsellor to advi him.
One young man was favored espc~
cially by the king, but the other
counsellors shook their heads
wisely and Inul‘mnredl, “little
things.” And the counsellors pro-
posed to the king that he bring
to the palace those men from
whmn he would choose his chief
counsellor and test their wisdom.
So the king brought together cer-
tain men and questioned them con-
ccrnim,r their wisdom in the affairs
of the kingdom. And each man
chipped his answers on a stone tab-
lct. And as they were together in
the room, the king gazed with af-
fection on the young man whom
he favored. lot as ln‘ was gazing,
he closed his L s to >lllll out what
he had seen. r the favored one
was casting his cyrs on his neigh-

 

r:

  

bor's tablet, and chipping, as his
ncigilrbor Chipped, .- nr the king
wept. And next day he sent a
message to lll‘c young man to meet
him at the city gates. And when
the young man app ‘ared, the king
rose in his chariot in great scorn,
and, pointing to the city gates, said,
“Get there hence, and nevermorn
shall thy face be seen in tlhesc gates,
for he that s‘tcalcth the twoipence
bath lost his honour as if he had
stolen the price of the kingdom.”

And llhu young man wandered on
the face of the earth all his days.
And at last tllc gods called him to
Olympus, and the gods gave com—
mand that he was to be chosen
oftimcs to a high place, and he
would always fail because he lacked
the wisdom himself. And then Zeus
gave command: “ lictwecn the test-
ing times let him forever copy these
words from a neighbor's tablet,
‘What shall the profit of a man‘s
gain be if thereby be losclh his
soul?” And the scribe in writing
opposite this name in the book of
men. paused. then he smiled a
twisted smile and wrote: “ lie that
cribbnth ' "

 

 

Moreover. the kick of a donkey is
quite as frequently disastrous as it
is beneficial; whe‘ . the meat of
a real live oyster is almost always
wholesome.

  

I

As we consider lln- past term in
retrospect. we note that [the donkey
type seems to have overrun the
place, kicking up considerable fuss,
but doing little to promote the \ch-
fare of the college. If anything,
they have hindered it, by pawng
up a few leaky excuses for mal—
fensancL‘, which nevertheless held
water enough so that thcy got by.
We propose now to use this column
as a wedge and open up a few of
our oyster-type as<ociate~¢. men and
women of the cats-open, month-
shnt kind. in an effort to disclose
some serious thought and a few
pearls of common sense.

 

Here is a hit of a. conversation
that took place between—never
mind whom:

(3.: Do you think that the type
of men who come to State College
compare favorably with the type
of men that go to other colleges,
especially colleges where men are
in the majority?

A,: if ym take the men in a
l'reshm  at State College, and
multiply the 1, ligurativ -ly speaking,
until you have a class equal in
size to the freshman class of any
m'm's college, -yon will have a
l hman class that will l‘ltllk even
with that to which they are
compared.

Q: Then why don’t they make
good. comparatively. as the men in
the other college: make good?

What is the answer? The dis-
cussion begins in the next issue.
