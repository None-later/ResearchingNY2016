From

A Faint Blue Glow

To Modern Miracles

EDISON saw it first—a mere shadow of blue light streaking across the
terminals inside an imperfect electric lamp. This “leak” of elec-
tric current, an obstacle to lamp perfection. was soon banished by
removing more air from the bulbs.

But the ghostly light, and its mysterious disappearance in a high
vacuum remained unexplained for years.
Then   Thomson established the electron theory on the trans-
mission of electricity in a partial vacuum—and the blue light was
in a very high vacuum, however. the light and appar-

understood.
ently the currents that caused it disappeared.

One day, however, a scientist in the Research Laboratories of the
General Electric Company proved that a current could be made to pass
through the highest possible vacuum, and could' be varied according to
But the phantom light had vanished.

ﬁxed laws.

Here was a new and definite phenomenon—a basis for further re-

Search.

Immediately. scientists began a series of experiments with far reach-
ing practical results. A new type of X-ray tube, known as the Coolidge
tube, soon gave a great impetus to the art of surgery. The Kenotron
and Pliotron, followed in quick succession by the Dynatron and Mag-
netron. made possible long distance radio telephony and revolutionized
radio telegraphy. And the usefulness of the “tron” family has only

begun.

The troublesome little blue glow was banished nearly forty years
ago. But for scientiﬁc research, it would have been forgotten. Yet
there is hardly a man, woman or child in the country today whose
life has not been beneﬁted, directly or indirectly, by the results of
the scientific investigations that followed.

Thus it is that persistent organized research gives man new tools.

The meetings for the discussion
of our entry into the economic
conference at Genoa are but a part
of a deﬁnite program of collegiate
discussion of international eocnomic
problems Plans have been made
to hold frequent meetings in con-
venient centers throughout the
country and in individual colleges
in order to discover and record the

sentiment of the colleges on the
questions of the day.

The lirst conference for the dis-
cussion of disarmament and the
economic problems growing out of
it was held at Princeton University.
A second conference at Chicago
where 178 delegates from the de-
nominational colleges discussed
similar problems. resulted in the
permanent organization of the Na-
tional Student Committee for Lim-
itation of Armaments.

The entire movement is a hope-
ful sign of awakening student in-
terest in public aﬂ'airs. There is
every reason to believe that the
students of America are learning
to apply the economic principles of
the class—room. to problems of
active politics, and to voice their
opinion freely in international mat-
ters.

And there is reason to believe
that expressions of their opinion
