WHAT’S THE USE?

'l'here wa.~ once a time when the
if some famous “5; re” to
c that a woman's hair is
her crowning glory was accepted
by all of the gentle sex. lint times
have Cll:tllt.'.‘ctl. 'l‘he barber is at his
work and. oh, what man can note
the devastation and remain un-
moved.

.\'nw this is not meant as re-
proof. A girl might as well be out
of the world as out of style. lint
it make; a prior fellow wonder what
is coming next. It used to be nice
to think tha: in this small college
a person could know everyone else.
Now in these halls. he sees some
new pet‘iltlt'. They are not really
new because they have a strangely
familiar limk. Who are they?
.\iter some thought. he gets it. They
ar_ 'Ulllt: of the old faiiii ll' girls
who have had the cnnace to de’
capitute their ldmidt: or brunette
locks in i", to that austere
goddess, Danie Fashion.

.‘neh oi cours is the way of
things. llz'ir will still be bobbed
and wicn‘ will still he worn till the
end of time. Men will always won~
dcr how they do it. but what's the
use? Women always were a Intuit;

CodﬁTESY

llmr well versed some of the
students of State College are in
all the ordinary rules of etiquette!
One may note it anywhere, in the
halls, in the classroom, in the Cafe—
teria. Some students are so polite
in this Ill-'lil rush for knowledge
that they cannot spend extra effort
enough to say, “excuse me, please,"
or “pardon me.”

Shall we allow this comment of
an onlooker to stand and never
show cause for an amendment? “it
is to be regretted that State Col-
lege does not offer a. four year
compulsory course in common man-
nch with an examination con-
ducted in the State College office
and cafeteria waiting lines. This
course would he of beneﬁt to State
College because it would eliminate
a certain class of hours which it
now possesses.”

Due to the fact that so many
\Jeople think. that because material

the “News” is asking that hereafter
all contributors be kind enough to
co-oierate and have everything in

WASTING TIME

ll is a recognized fact that wast-
iut.r time in the sitinplest thing in
the world to do, providing it is
done unconsciously; but just try to
plan doing it and set about it In a
t dike manner. The result
, 'prising to a marked degree.

A student finds himself with noth-
int.r to do for one hour; no math,
no psych, no nothing! (0f eour e
this is a purely an imaginary stu—
dent used as an example.) lie im~
ttlediately starts to form an elabor-
ate plan for wasting his lune hour
in an appropriate manner, with the
result that he makes a complete
failure of doingr it. He does noth-
ing but thinks about it and spends.
what seems to him, days and (la

NOTICE

ENGLISH TEACHERS

One of the first problems which
the English teacher faces when she
begins work on a piece of literature
is the question of what reference
material to use and of where to
secure it.

Every week there will be an ex-
hibit in the library, of books, pic-
turcs, and clippings to be used in
connection with the teaching of a
certain piece of literature pre-
scribed for high schools.

TERPSICHORE

..__.._..

How much do we, as a college,
contribute to the idea that is fast
heemning prC'alcnt. to the point
of newspaper publicity, that colle e
men and women are the ‘lIlOHl rec <-
less of jaw. hounds? A few years
ago it was popular belief that all
college men were druukards. 'l‘herc
wt probably no more foundation
for such a belief. than there is for
the idea concerning the way in
which college ulndents dance. it
only happened that when college
men did drink they us y drunk
in a bunch, and con ntly at-
tracted attention. V. likely that
is the reason why the dancing,r at-
tracts attention because it it us~
uall ' a group affair. Ilut whatever
the reasons for the growth of such
an idea, it has a certain dis/edit-
int.r inllnence that should not he
passed over lit-.‘htly. The belief in
Ilic general depravity of college
men provides a handicap not only
in colleges. but to individuals. and

THE FIRST ANTIDOTE

In considering the case of inan-
Inmd Versus elfeminuey we find the
Illn~l ohvious cause for the latter
in he a question of numbers, in
any system til cnedlwalimi a ratio
of ten nn-mliers it one to one
member of the rippo>ile is de-
ridedly nnlurtunate. 'l'ln-re can he
of personalities; no
in-ntralimtimt of the forces that
arise from the tlilfcrenccs in the
inmtres of the two sexes. The re~
rpti cments and procedures that are
natural for the greater number are
hound to predominate. The per-
sonality of the lancer hotly inevit-
ably imposes itself upon that of
the smaller, and thus we lind our
manhood completely snlnnerged by
\\'ulll£tllltti(ul. And when we learn
Ihal Stale ('nllee- men are consid-
t'l't'tl more, or less elfeminale by
their more fortunate fellows we
wmnlcr what can he done about it.

“'0 y that it is a question of
nnniln .. \Ve realixe at once that
we cannot readily remedy the situ—
ation as it stands. We cannot drag
in men enough to balance the num-
bers. nor could lllt' College at pr ‘,-
cn .ctnnodate them if we could.
it is natural, therefore, to look for
an antidote. and if we succeed in
linding one or more, we must face
the situation squarely and-admit
that it isn't going to do any good
unless we make use of it.

\Ve meet this sad ratio of ten
to one ﬁrst in classes. Very well,
let us see if we cannot arrange for
a few classes in which there are no
women. This, to be sure, is up to
the authorities. but you can wager
that they won't bother with it.
unless we

 

 

 

 

   

 

 

 

convince them of the
nee s<ity and show them that we
really want it. Again we find that
a man is lost in the. cheering: sec~
tirm at athletic contests in which
we participate. is there any real
reason why the men can’t group
themselves together in the section—
not because we are mad at the. girls,
but because of the group spirit that
it will tzive the men? It is worth
trying if we can be sure that there
Will not be too many slackers.

 

ldually. wc lind ourselves lone way-
farel‘s upon a sea of femininity at
our social functions Why not,
then. institute a few "stag" parties,
a smoker or two, a lecture for men,
a rest room for men? Why haven't
we a' M. A. A. as well as a G. A. A.
in other words, why don‘t the men
of State College not together as a
group? Surely we are men enough
to be able to lay aside personal or
fraternal differences and associate
with each other as sons of State.
’l‘herc will be a meeting of all the
men of State College in the Audi-
tnrium, ’l‘uesday evening, February
