From A Faint Blue Glow
To Modern Miracles

DlSON saw it ﬁrst——-a mere shadow of blue light streakingacross the

terminals inside an imperfect electric lamp. This “leak” of elec«
trie current, an obstacle to lamp perfection. was soon banished by
removing more air from the bulbs.

But the ghostly light, and its mysterious disappearance in a high
vacuum remained unexplained for years.

Then   Thomson established the electron theory on the trans-
mission oi electricity in a partial vacuum—and the blue light was
understood. in a very high vacuum, howaver, the light and appar-
ently the currents that caused it disappeared.

One day, however, a scientist in the Research Laboratories of the
General Electric Company proved thata currcntcould be made to pass
through the highest possible vacuum, and could be varied according to
ﬁxed laws. But the phantom light had vanished.

Here was a new and deﬁnite phenomenon~a basis for Further re‘
search.

immediately, scientists began a series of experiments with far reach-
ing practical results. A new type of X-ray tube, known as the Coolidge
tube, soon gave a great impetus to the art of surgery. The Kenotron
and Pliotron, followed in quick‘succession by the Dynatron and Mag—
netron, made possible long distance radio telephony and revolutionized
radio telegraphy. And the usefulness of the "tron" family has only
begun.

The troublesome little blue glow was banished nearly forty years
ago. But for scientiﬁc research, it would have been forgotten. Yet
there is hardly a man, woman or child in the country today whose
life has not been beneﬁted, directly or indirectly, by the results of
the scientiﬁc investigations that followed.

Thus it is that persistent organized research gives man new tools,
makes available forces that otherwise might remain unknown for
centuries.
