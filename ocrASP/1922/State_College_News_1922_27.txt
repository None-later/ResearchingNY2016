CHAMBER MUSIC BY
LONDON QUARTET

Big Opportunity

The appearance of the London
String Quartet -in Albany should
prove one of the hit: musical events
of the season.

t‘hambcr music is one of the
oldest forms of ensemble. and until
coinparaitiVi-ly recent years, has had

but a small group of devotees.
Often the trouble has been with
the interpreters who were so

musically intellectual that the ap-
peal they made was never to the
general public. lint coming.r lo
Chancellor's Hall on March 3, at
eight o'clock is the London String
Quartet, who~e interpretations as
Chamber Mus Artists have been
termed sens: tonal by the critics
of the few cm s that tlteir limited
time in America allows them to
visit. These four young English-
lllt'll lirst appeared in New 'ork
absolutely unheralded. announcing
six concerts in one week's time.
Furthermore, they were to play only
lieethoven—ltis seventeen string
quartets. So great was the success
oi this tninature lleethoven fes-
tival that requests wore made for
a later return in which they are to
give the works of many other com»
post-rs including the ultra‘motlern.

Albany has never had mnclt op-
portunity to enjoy Chamber Music,
and not for years has a string
quartet appeared here. Such a
performance as will be enjoyed by
those who love Chamber Music can
be given only under the auspices
o an educational institution.
Therefore, if this concert is a suc’

world. a wide opportunity to hear

the vicinity. as this will be the be—
ginning of a series of like concerts.
it is certaittly a bargain for
