THE MINUS QUANTITY

,-\ bunch of us State College tulk
were having an informal (llSCIIS'
sion ahout various thing,r
i' rent haskeihall ennui.
~a_viii,L: that State t‘olleuc had
shown quite a hit of s rii iii coin-
ing out to the ganun, and that
she had ycllcd more (it‘ less lustily
at every game. and that . lut
nu, not at every game. Someone
in a small voice recalled that State
had not yelled more or less lnstily
at the St. Lawrence game and
wondered dazedly ahout the rea-
son. We all remembered then that
there had hecn no white-sweatcrl-d.
horn-equipped cheer-leader ahrriatl
that night, which of ammo at:—
counted for no cheers, and the 1055
(if the game—almost entirely.
'l'his launched us fairly into a re-
M'ltt‘Cll on the suhjeet of the origin
of a State College rhecr-leadcr.
\\"e traced it to recnmmcudatinns
l-y the .\leii's Athletic (.'niiiicil hut
mnld locate no such recommenda-
lilillS for this year. i wonder why
not? From all appraranecs college
spirit only has supported .\lr.
Foster in his services 50 far this
year. Surely a cheer—leader is an
important emu 'h matter for the
t'nnnitil to consider, and surely
there is enough material upon
which to liase these considerations.
State needs a liry Cheer-leader to
organize her lusty yelling. Why
can‘t site have one ofﬁcially?

 

  

 

 

 

THREE CHEERS

Several weeks ago our men
brought forth in this college a new
basketball team, conceived iii good
sportsmanship and dedicated to
the proposition that many gai'ncs
were to he won. Since then they
have had it trying,' season, testing
whether that team or any team
so conceived and so dedicated can
long endure. Now we have come
to a time when we may rally
around those who have spent their
time that basketball in State Col‘
lege might live. Father Time will
soon erase these lines from our
memories, lint he can never for-

 

get the record our team has started
to n‘iakc this year.

it is [or us the interested. rather
to he dedicated ll(‘|’C tn the tllllill“
ished games which they who ion "ll-l.
for ins, have thus far so imin
endeavored. it is rather for us to
he here dcdiraled to the two Ktlttlus
remaining,r lieiore us, that from these
loyal defenders of the purple and
[.{l)l(l. we take increased enthusiasm
for those names for which they
gave their hill measure of enthu-
siasm: that we llt'l't‘ highly resolve
that our men shall not have played
in vain, that State shall increase its
dominion, and the liaskethall team
of State. liy Stale. and for State,
shall llUl dissemlile, forever.
