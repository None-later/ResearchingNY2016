THE BETTER CHANCES
OF DISARMAMENT

[it is a natural enough question
to ask ourselves whether this Dis-
armament Conference of 19.11 and
1922 has atty better cltances for
success tltan had the Hague Con!
ferences of 1899 and 19117, and the
answer comes back to us in the
affirmative: It has.

in the first place the great op-
position to any attempt to decide
upon any step that really would
lessen the chances of war, Germany,
is not present at this conference.
Germany was willing enough to
meet at these conferences, she
eagerly went thrn the motion of
trying to preserve pcacc, lntt at the
same time she consistently refused
to pttt her signature to a single
article that would in any way
shackle ltcr war making machine
to the minutest degree. She rc-
fuscd to give her pledge against
bombing front aeroplanes or using
dnm—dunt bullets. :\t first. before
the Conference was called. many
thought that Japan would strenu-
onsly oppose any very drastic
measures that the other great pow-
ers might signify their willingness
to adopt. But 'J'apan has done no
table rapping, site has played the
gentlcmcn's part in earnestly try-
ing; to bring about a satisfactory
arrangement for thr- limitation of
armaments

in the 1 end place there is an
economic limit to this mad race. in
the building of war machines.
Nations plunged itt indebtedness
from which it will take them now
generations to recover, do not dare
keep increasing their war e\'pcndi‘
turcs in times of peace. The old
argument that preparedness in-
sured against war has been blasted
to pieces beyond every hope of
ever recovering any semblance of
logic. Europe spent 40 million dol-
lars annually in preparing against
war, and behold: in 1914 she awoke
from her fool's dream to ﬁnd her-
self plunged in the most awful
catastrophe of all history. lint it
will have been worth the sacriﬁce
of this struggle if the world has
learned that preparing against war
is identically the samevas preparing
for war. (23)

ATTENTION, MEN!

There is a tradition among men
that the fellowship and loyalty of
college classmates shall be the litt-
est and the best. 'l‘ht‘ir common
spirit of loyalty for their :\ltna
.\ltrtcr draws them together and out
of this association grows that deep
attd abiding spirit of fellowship that
binds the sons of one “Dear .\lolh~
er” to each other with ties that
otttlive the years. it means co-
operation, a united effort for a
common purpose, and the backing
of a classmate against any odds.

\Vc men of State have so far
failed to achieve such a spirit of
loyality and fellowship. Each in-
dividual one of us seems to be
selfisny bent on his own personal
pleasure to the exclusion of all
else. 'e are out for evcrvtbing
that is for our own individual bcnc~
lit. We seem to have no time to
give to the development of the in-
terest of the men as a group. or
to the promotion of mwsenline
associations. We are the willing
victims of circtunstanee—which cir-
cums'tancc in our case is simply an
overdose of fctrtininity. We need
the strengthening influence of a

get together and start something.

\\'ashing»ton conference on limita’
lion of armaments, is being demon-
strated by their attitude toward
the mock conference which is now
itt session at Syracuse University.

Soon after the invitation to the
Washington parley had been an-
nounced and several weeks before
it convened. the Historical Associ-
ation and the international Rela-
tions (‘lnb decided to pool their
plans for a program and to pre
sent a mock conference in imitation
of the international gathering. The
purpose was to put more life into
the departmental cltth meetings, to
acquaint the students and public
with the personnel. procedure. and
problems of the great gathering,
and hence to stimulate an intelli-
gent interest in the cause of world
peace.

So far as practicable, the details
of the real conference are imitated;
but where interest might be heigltt‘
cited or information might be con—
veyed by tle arting front the histor-
ical accur.’ , there is no hesitation
in doingr so.

 

 

Students Organize Conference

it is a student affair. A com-
mittee, composed mainly of gradu-
ate and undergraduate students.
selected forty students to imperson-
ale the delegates, experts and ad»

 

visers at Washing-ton, and by the
time each of these. dignitaries ar-
rived in America he had an under-
stndy at Syracuse carefully scan—
ning the news dispatches of his
doings. The City Library and the
l..'nivcrsity Library co-opcrated in
making available bibliographies, and
a Iilc of clippings was kept iii the
History Seminar.

.\lany of the delegates are ment—
bers of the Cosmopolitan Club and
do not have to imitate a foreign
accent or feign a patriotic senti-
ment for the country they repre-
sent. This applies particularly to
the ‘Fltinesc, Early in tltc confer-
ence the local papers found that the
Chinese Students' Club had objected
to including Americans on their
delegation and had chosen a (1ch-
gation of their own. They featured
the “Row in the Disarmament Con-
ferencc." and this gave the confer-
ence some good advertising and an
occasion for appointing a creden—
tials committee. in each delegation
the leader is expected to assign
specilic problems to his colleagues
individually, select the spokesmen at
the different sessions, and is re-
sponsible for the work of his dele-
gation. The agenda develops in
correspondence with events at
Washington.
