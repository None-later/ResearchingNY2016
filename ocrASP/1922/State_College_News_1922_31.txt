THAT NEIGHBORING
LOT

.\.-; everyone knows, there is a
vacant lot between State t'ollcnc
and Albany High School, This is
dirty. unsanitary, and is used for a
garbage heap. It is a bad»smellitn.:,
wtu‘swb’rnking‘ place.

A bill for the buying of this lot
for State t'oilece is now waiting to
be voted on in the Senate of the
State Legislature. The passing of
it will be of great advantage to
State (‘olh-tte, Milne High School,
and the (’in of Albany

large gymnasium for girls, a

LONDON STRING
QUARTET

When the London String Quartet
app ' in Albany on March 3. the
mus al public will hear interpreters
of chamber nulsie whose prefect
ensemble is something; .‘tllpl‘ttttl‘lting
an achieveim-nt.

The name of this organization
has been chiefly associated with the
works of Beethoven; but their in-
terpretation of other masters, from
Mozart to liach to :the present
day ulll‘tt-Illotlt‘l‘tlﬁ has met with
equal approval from the critics.

'l'heir combined lone ' .0 full of
opulent beauty, 'the listener is often
inclined to believe them symphonic
in size. One wonders if chamber
music would have so slowly come
into its own here in America if tiltese
four young artists had appeared
here earlier in their career.
