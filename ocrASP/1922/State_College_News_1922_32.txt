THE HONOR SYSTEM

Although there were several
good speeches on the Honor Sys-
teni given in chapcl. they did not
apply directly to this system in
State (Iol'rue. Certainly \\’I' all ad-
mit that the system is good and
practicable in some colleges; but
our question is would it work at
State?

In my estimation State College
is (lichrcnt from most other col-
lcecs in that its students. for the
most part, lack unity and proper
respect for the college. A number
come here because they wislt to
waste a few years before something
else occurs; some come because it
is near home and their tinancial
affairs or parental authority for-
bids them to go somewhere clst;
others are here from other colleges
for several reasons. On this ac~
count.-they have very little loyalty
to or appreciation of Slain college.
Why shouldn't tlicv cheat on an
exam? it means little to them;
and it takes an awful amount of
study to have sufficient information
on several subjects to pass exams!
Would you blame any of these d-is~
interested people for cribbing if
they got the chance?

My second reason for opposing
the honor system is one which
probably prevails in every college
to a certain extent. It is a charac-
teristic of otir age: We have a dc-
cided trend toward moral laxity
Why should we do right any more
than wrong?‘ Very few of us take
Ethics. if we know exactly where
to find certain information in a book
and consider the information rather
trivial, why not consult our book?
Then, we often forget things just
the moment we need them most;
that is an cxasperating situation;
why not take a glance at our notes?

Also. everyone is more or less
sclf~intcrcsted. We might take the
attitude of going through an exam
for, our own good; and if other
people want to cheat, let_them do
it;’we don’t care! This would
certainly be the- general attitude;
forzit is much.more-Self-satisfactory
than that of being on the watch and
ready to report a class-mate for
cribbing.

 

think not. Ve are too widely
separated in spirit to uphold the
honor of our college: \rr have u
lrndcnry in depreciate honor; and
we are too s‘t‘lf»~itit(tl‘t'lt'rl to turn
what our neighbor docs. Ht

 
 

STUDENT MORALE

.\ new theory has been set forth
by State t'nllrgc students. it is
that so long as their own charnc s
are not worth considering, neither
is lu rt; ‘lt‘l' of State t'ollt‘ge
worth rm idvrine‘. 'l'hc Iii-st (IS-
snmptiou been proved by the
action of State College Slillll‘lll‘ﬁ.
:\ State ('tillt-ge student, to bc a
regular out: and in good standing
among; the tillit‘ial ruwdies of
"State." must be as lowvbrow as
possible. When any State (fully-go
function is mentioned. he must u,
the will .ll word, “RaZ-z-vz-bc‘
He must insinuate that “State” is
It "rotten hole" anyway. And by
his desires. he expresses ll idea of
a college by "Jim oh, jazz—and
the vamp." in his ideal college
the hinetme'r would be built
around "Razdit-rrics.”‘tlit- occupa-
tion around “park dancing." and the
peoph- admitted must be as vulgar
as possible. Since the Statc ('ul-
it'e'c student is not iii the vaudeville
type of college, he tries to reform

The character of state College?
To be specitic—at a recent play,
the few people who believed that
character is worth while and that
politeness is part. of it were over-
whelmed by those who do =ii0t be—
lieve in characters. And the char-
actcr of State College has gone
forth on the basis of cliaraotei'lcss
people. We are anxious for
“State’s” reputation at basketball,
we are not anxious for her reputa-
tion in art. Of what use for State
College to have an honorable rep-
iitation in athletics? it is offset
by her dishonor in art. We aim
to play fair on the basketball court,
but in the auditorium foul play
is the keynote. State College as
she is represented says, “We want
to be bit.r brutes, we do: we won't
use in brains. We know the laws
of ﬁght, but we won't learn the
laws of character. so there."

Because of the theory that char-
acter d'oos not count. State College
hasgivcn proof for the reputation
it will have. Non—appreciation is

PAY. UP ll

 

Dr. Croa ale reports that the
present statistics of the liitirmary
litind show that approximately ldtl
students have not paid their inlii'ui-
ary tax. Already $300 have been
spent and about 12 people have
been taken care of at the Albany
Hospital. The fact that so much
has already been spent is due to
the epidemic of inﬂuenza which has
been prevalent at State.

The student body voted nuan-
iinously to support the inlirmary
and it seems that the actual support
should be no less whole-hearted.
l’crhaps the people who have not
paid their tax are ones who are
never ill and think it is useless to
prepare for future emergencies.
lint even if we do not feel that we
are to .be bcneiittcd personally. we
should remember that this is illl’
entirely new venture for State and
that we should put it over in the
best possible manner.

So far it has worked very well
indeed. bf you don't believe it. just
ask some of those aboveoneirtioned
dozen people how they enjoyed the
conveniences of the hospital as
compared with the pleasures of an
illness in a boarding-house with no
one to care for them tburt ever-
worked and possibly irritable room-
llltl‘lC‘S.

Look around for that one ﬁfty
($1.50) and try to pay the tax.

STUDENT ASSEMBLY

.llcrc is a short resume of the
dlscussion of the honor system.
it’s ‘to get everyone prepared for
another forum of the same kind.

The Student Assembly of Friday.
liobruary l was given over to a
forum, at which the question——
SHALL STATE COLLEGE
HAVE AN HONOR SYSTEM—
was discussed. The debate was a
spirited one as the majority of the
students. inade familiar with the
question throngh'thc “News,” had
formed decided opinions. The first
speaker. hlir. McClucr. maintained
that the honor system was an ideal
thingr but 'ih'll'tillly practical. For
his experiences in schools where
the honor SyStC'm had been adopted,
showed him chat it is not only the
violators who impede its success.
but those who shield them. One
student who sees another cribbing
will never stand up and publicly
announce the fact. And as private
dcn-uiilcmtions do not seem to go
hand in hand with honor. there can
be no perfect honor system until
this is remedied.
