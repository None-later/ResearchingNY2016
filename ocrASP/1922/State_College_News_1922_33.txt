 W Why Is Iron Magnetic?

l‘iorse-shOC magnet attracts a steel needle. But why?
We don‘t know exactly. We do know that electricity
and magnetism are related.

in clynamos and motors we. apply electromagnetic cliccts.
All our pOWer—stations, lighting systems, electric traction and
motor drives, even the ignition systems of our automobiles.
depend upon these magnetic efieets which we use and do not
understand.

Perhaps it we understood them we could utilize them much
more efﬁciently. Perhaps we could discovor combinations of
metals more magnetic than iron.

The Research Laboratories of the General Electric Company
investigate magnetism by trying to find out more about elec-
trons and their arrangement in atoms.

X-rays have shown that each iron atom consists of electrons
grouped around a central nucleus— like planets around an
inﬁnitesimal sun. X-rays enable us to some extent to see ir to the
atom and may at last. reveal to us what malces for magnetism.

This is research in pure science, and nothing else. Only thus
can real progress be made.

Studies of this kind are constantly resulting in minorimprove-v
ments. But some day a discovery may be made which will
enable a metallurgist to work out the formula for a m Ignetic
alloy which has not yet been cast, but which will surely have
the properties required. Such a result would be an achieve-
ment with tremendous possibilities. It would improve all
electric generators, motors, and magnetic devices.

in the meantime the continual improvement in electrical
machinery proceeds, in lesser steps. These summed up, con-
stitute the phenomenal progress experienced in the electrical
art during the past twenty-ﬁve years.

friends!

 

 

An added attraction will be 11 LONDON STRING QUART-

ET HAS NO RIVALS

 

London String Quartet, which is
soon to visit the United States and
Honolulu, for the second time, is
one of the most famous organiza'
tions of its kind. in Europe the

. .. Q. has no rivals. It was
lonnrlerl in 1908 giving its first Lon-
don CDIlcert in 1910. Within the
space of ten years the quartet has
given more than 150 recitals in
the British capital. it was the ﬁrst
musical organization to play all the
Beethoven quantets in chronologi-
cal orrlcr. Among the cities willere
this has been done are London, Ed-
inburgh, Leeds, Christiania, Stock-
holm, and New York.
