LONDON STRING QUARTET
Continued from page 1

The London String Quartet was

formed in 1908tby Mr. Albert Sam-
mo’ns, and after 27 rehearsals gave
its lirst performance in Bechstcin
Hall with much success. ,

During the war the Quartet made
a specialty of “pop” concerts at
which the general public became
most interested, and larger audi-
ences resulted. At all of these con-
certs the programs consisted of
classic, modern and some English
works.

One of the chiel features of the
quartet has been to give the worlts
oi English compo‘u‘s, and in so
doing many interesting composi-
tions have been brought out.
Those given in this country im-
mediately received recognition.

In 1917 Mr. Summons gave up
his work with the quartet, and Mr.
James Levey took his place, and is
today recognized as the leader of
the organization. In both Stock-
holm and Christiania the royal iam-
ily made it a point to attend one
or more performances. ln Paris
the quartet met with line success,
and in Amsterdam one concert
was entirely composed of English
numbers. In Spain the quartet met
with the greatest success ever given
a foreign org' .ation. larcelona,
Madrid, Cadiz and other cities
greeted them with capacity houses.

While it has always been the dc-
sire oi the London String Quartet
to further the works of new ling-
lish composers; the works of the
old masters have always enjoyed
a. prominent place on their pro—
grams. The Beethoven cycle has
been featured in both New York
and London.

While in Sweden a new quartet
by Stenhammer was procured, and
also a spanish work by Joaquim
Turina.

The featured new work in Lon-
don was a quartet composition by
Fritz Kreisler, and the world's
greatest violinist was present at its
premier.

Mr. Levey and his associates
have returned to America, this time
to play all the principal cities in the
country. Before leaving New York
he said: “Without doubt New
York is the greatest musical cen-
ter we have ever visited. The great
mass of music performed here is
amazing. and we wonder where
the great audiences come from.
Our reception has been wonderful,
and now we want to see this great
country more than ever.”

STUDENT ASSEMBLY
(Continued from page 2.)

Miss Baker, on the other hand,
said that this public denounccment
was one of the strongest assets of
the system. She declared that it
would never be necessary to resort
to this drastic measure twice in the
same case as the student would
either .give up his cribbing or
change his college.

Miss Wilcox took issue with Mr.
hIcOluer’s statement that there was
not enough group spirit to put the
honor system through. She said
that if this spirit does not now
exist, it would after the adoption
of the honor system. For a student
who cribs, lowers not only his own
morale, ..but the whole college
standard. Personal feelings for in~
dividuals should came second, then,
and love of fair play for State. first.

Miss Rice .took a vote to see
whether the students desire to con-
tinue the discussion at another
ﬁorum. The majority voted in the
afﬁrmative. A committee com-
posed of Katherine Pcltz, Jack Mc-
Cluer, Marjorie Blythe, and Mary
Veddcr ‘to sum up the general opin-
ion of the student body.

 

 

STATE COLLEGE NEWS,

STUDENT MORALE

(Continued from page 2.)
side world is, “lack of morale."
And ‘those whom we wronged have
enough of that which we lack, not
to say, “State College is a brute,”
but out of pity 'they have made a
comparison which is so true (and
that is why the guilty resent it so)
that we, characteriess barbarians
of jazz days, dare not deny it—
“State College is a child."

ELECTROGRAPHS

The radio message sent by Pres-
ident Harding at the openingr of the
great central radio stationon Long
island, was picked up in over sev-
enteen foreign countries. The sta’
tiou is operated by the Radio
Corporation of America.

One of the largest circuit break-
ers in the world has recently been
built by an American electrical
concern. It is rated at lﬁ5,l)0ll volts.
According to Dr. C. l'. Steinmetz,
the energy dissipated when :1 cir«
cuit breaker of this size automati-
cally opens on overload, is equal to
the energy which would be con-
snmed in a head—on collision be-
tween two l25-ton locomotich
meeting at a speed of 45 miles an
hour.

PICKING I COTTON BY
ELECTRICITY

A device consisting ol a farm
tractor equipped with an electric
generator. is being used success-
fully in the northern cotton belt to
pick cotton with electricity's aid.
Hollow ﬂexible tubes reach out in
four directions from the tractor.
On the end of each is a set of re—
volving brushes encased in a small
metal frame, with an opening about
the size of a man's double ﬁsts, and
sufﬁciently large to take a boll of
cotton. The brushes are driven by
an electric motor through a ﬂexible
drive shaft and revolve inwardly, or
toward each other. This creates a
comb-like movement which pulls
the cotton from the plant the mo-
ment it comes in contact with the
brushes. It is then sucked up the
hollow tube and deposited in a re-
ecptacle carried on the tractor.
Tests ‘have indicated that the new
electric cotton picker makes it pos-
sible for a person to gather from
400 to 700 pounds of cotton .1 day
as compared with 70 to 150 by
hand. 1
