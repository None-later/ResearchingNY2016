MOTHER WAS FLAPPER

The following is an intcre ting
continent on some of the discussion
which took plare at the recent con-
ference of Deans of Colleges, which
llean ;\nna lC. l'it-ree attended in
lilticago:

MOTH ER WAS FLAPPER
ONCE

And Oxford Dean Says Daughter
Will Be a Better Mother

Mother was a tlapper, ton, except
that that modern appellation hadn't
been imprn'ted front England in her
day, and the campus customs of
twenty-five years ago didn't have
tuhe benelit of 1922 publicity meth~
ods. That is tltc reason Miss
Eleanor Adams, president of Ox.
ford College for Women, defends
the galoshvllupping, bobbed haired
wearer o kneedength skirts of
to-day.

“The socially grotesque features
of today are no worse than those
of other times.“ said Miss Adams,
one of the delegates to the confer-
ence of (leans of women.

“ Remember," site said, ” the
Merry Widow hat, balloon sleeves,
the wire rat of the once famous
pompadonr, and the ‘Boston dip’
waist.

“i am very optimistic about the

modern girl,” she continued. “ She

wt 1 be a much more intelligent
mother than was her own mother.
"The modern girl has developed
initiative. Her surplus energy ex-
pends itself itt radical opinions, ex-
trcute dress, and restlessness. She
is a little puzzled about what to do
with what she learns in college, but
we are striving to train her, not so
much for leadership as for service."
