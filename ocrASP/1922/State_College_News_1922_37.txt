SELF-DEFENSE

 

The last issue of the “News,”
with its two very iiiticli discussed
editorials, has brought a great deal
of censure upon the members (if
the ncu'sboard, for wliicll we feel
that a word of explanation is iicccs‘
sary.

Following the custom of other
iicwslioards, we have been accept-
in:.s articles contributed by indi-
viduals of the student body and
have been printing them on the ed—
itorial page. Many people have the
wrong iiiipi ion in that they
think tillat cv ‘ything printed i-x—
presses the sculinn-nts of the
“News.” l)" lll(' contrary have
been published for the piirp L of
giving students a chance to expr
themselves

in order that mistakes may not
be made in the future. coiitri‘l'iuted
articles which will in no way do
damage to the college. will be
printed in a column by tlliciiiselves,
and will be signed either in full,
with numerals. or with initials. All
such contributors must make their
identity. known to the " News." No
anonymous articles will be accepted.

'l‘llic before-mentioned editorials
were printed not as expressing the
sentiments of the "News," and de-
cidedly without iiial-intenrt or for
the purpose of unduly arousing any
members of mllC student body. in
order to end any unnecessary (lis-
ctission. the “News” refuses to
print any answers to them, no mat-
ter how much they may be justified.

 
 
 
 

    

ONE WORD TESTS

In an aftermath of college news,
appearing in the dailies since mid-
year examinations, comes an article
telling of a new form of exams be-
ing used at Wells College. All do-
partmcnts are taking advantage of
the one word test as a method of
examining classes, much to the sat-
isfaction of the faculty and the
approval of ﬁlm students tihere.

Onenight think that one word
tests were quite a new thing. and
perhaps they are fer some colleges.
But here at State College we have

 

known them for a long time, and
an increasing number of depart-
ments are now constantly using
Uliis brief form of examination.

It is gratifying to know that we
zinc advanced in a field upon which
the majority of educational insti-
tutions are Just entering.

BE ON TIME

For the past few weeks it has
been quite noticeable that many
students are a little tardy in come
big in to take their seats in Assem-
bly. Oftentimcs many do not come
in until the Alma Mater is being
sung. This causes much more con-
fusion than tlhct'c should be when
the student body is singing the
Alma Mater. it also is rather an-
noyini,r in case some one is trying
to make an announcement or read
notices. ,

'l‘lie “ Ncws' would like to sug-
“(351 that each student try a little
harder to arrive in chapel on time,
provided .he has been rather lax
about «the matter before. Without
a doubt, in the rush of getting out
of classes many have found it (lif-
licult to get to the :iiidtioriuiii ex-
ai‘tly at 11:45. Can't we all do olir
part to correct this ovcisiulit?

 

WE HAVE THEM, TOO!

Intelligence Tests Suggested for
Union

i\lllCll discussion has been heard
lately about the intelligence tests
that are being held in some colleg
stillltjwltnl on the idea of the te. s

 

introd iced by the army. The cur—
rent issue of the “ Union College
.\lllllllll Monthly,” iii speaking

about tilu-se examination methods,
says:

" The "I‘horiidike intelligence cx~
aiuinatiuii’ (such as has been used
at Columbia and other institutions)
was applied to 395 lx'trto‘ers fresh-
men. We quote from litllC ‘ Rutgers
Alumni .\lontlily' the following
statement as to the interpretations
that should be put upon the scores
made, according to the experience
(it lllll'cc colleges of the first rank:

“ in the case of the Rutgers fresh-
men the scores showed that only 13
per cent. had a grade of 90 or over,
whereas in what is called the
standard class there ware 18 per cent
so graded. Furthermore, according
to the dictum just giVeii. 5 per cent.
were hopeless as college material.
nearly 10 per cent. more were those
who. having a grade under (it), were
very unlikely to succeed, and 21 per
cent, would have been classed as
doubtful. In other words only
per cent. of those adm'tt «1 were, as
the dean of Ringer 'tid. of 'ttti-
(lOtl‘lflCtlly sufficient intelligence for
the curriculum of a college of the

 

   

lirst rank.’ -

” How far these conditions .apply
to Union We do not know. We
suspect, though, that much the
same' conditions would he found
there as at Rutgers. lit: is trite that
our entrance standards have been
materially stiffened. so that fewer
of the unqualified are admitted
now. Nevertlheless. that a number
get by at the outset in otir present
system of admission by certiﬁcation
is clear, from the considerable
number that have to leave college
in the freshman and sophomore
years. The persistence of the
classes. as our secretary’s reports
show, though better than formerly.
is not what it should be. Another
indication that shows how our re-
cent students are standing is af-
fiorded by‘ the rating of the fresh-

A FABLE, BY AESOP, JR.

 

Once upon a time, iii the land of
long ago, there was a young sliep~
herd, and this shepherd was fair to
look upon and had found favor in
the eyes of the king. And, there-
fore, he was sent to care for the
favorite flock of the king. But
when his sheep wandered far, and
there was need of search for them,
the young man whispered to him-
self, “ it will be a rough way to be
traveled in search of those lost. I
slhiall fccl weary; even now i feel
a little of wcarincss. i will ask
one of my brother shepherds to
search for in sheep," And he
called to another shepherd; and that
shepherd, remembering the times
he had been weary, searched for
and returned with the lost sheep.
llut one day wolves came to the
flock, and the yiouii-g shop-herd
called for the other shepherd, and
they drove them away, but the
ytillllll: man did not besti-r himself,
only as he said, “i am weary.”
lltit in the eveningr he danced 10115.:
with the others, .-\iid after this ’had
been done many times, the other
shepherd ceased to answer the cry

‘for aid,

 

And they smiled unpleas-
antly at the young man when he
said, “I am weary.”

Now many of the flock strayed
and were lost, and the wolves (le-
vtourcd many, for there were only
one or two other shepherds who
would still tend flock for the weary
young man. And the king called
the young man unto him and ques-
tioned him concerning those lost,
and the young man said, “My king,
I knew thou wouldst be gentle
with me, for I was weary."
Whereat the king said, " Rest, btit
gio fro-iii my kingdom for thou canst
not rest and tend flocks at one
time.”

And after the young man went,
the gods took pity on» illlll'l because
he was near starvation, and called
lltilll unto them. And the gods ques-
tioned him concerning this life
among men, and the shepherd ali—
swered, “l was weary." And the
sound of a tiliousand groans was
in the air. Then Zeus gave decree,
" Let him always be weary in the
time of joy, but let hitii be always
diligent at work." i‘\ll(l the scribe
in writing opposite his name in the
book of men, wrote. beginning:
“He that passeth the buck ."
