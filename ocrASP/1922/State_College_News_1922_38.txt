What Is Water Japan?

APAN——not the country but a metal’coating varnish—-
and your morning bottle of milk. Totally unlike, yet
associatedl

Ordinary japan consists of a tough, rubbery, tar—like "base"
and a highly inﬂammable "solvent." The solvent dilutes
the base so that the metal may be coated with it easily. The
presence of the solvent involves considerable ﬁre risk, esper
cially in the baking oven.

Milk is a watery fluid containing suspended particles of
butter Fat, so small that one needs the ultraamicroscope to de:
tect them. An insoluble substance held permanently in sus«
pension in a liquid in this manner is in "colloidal suspension."

The principle of colloidal suspension as demonstrated in
milk was applied by the Research Laboratories of the General
Electric Company to develop Water Japan. In this com;
pound the particles of japan base are colloidally suspended
in water. The ﬁre risk vanishes.

So the analysis of milk has pointed the way to a safe

japan.

Again Nature serves industry.

Connected with the common things around us are many
principles which may be applied to the uses of industry with

revolutionary results.

As Hamlet said, "There are more

things in Heaven and earth, Horatio, than are dreamt of in
your philosophy."

Chemistry Club

The next meeting of thc Chem-
istry Club will 'be held the evening
of \Vednesday, March 8, at
o’clock. Professor Bronson will
speak on vitamines. At the last
meetingr recent advances in Chen-tr
istry were reported informally by
many members. Of interest to the
girls was the disclosure of several
methods of proving their diamonds
true or paste. Though we do not
suggest that the students test their
own diamonds, by means of hydro-
fluoric acid, this is a test. a real
diamond being able to withstand

 

the high cnrrosirc action of the
acid, while the paste will not. A
diamond will also show a more
brilliant lustre under water than a
paste composition.

Mr. Putnam. who was being in-
itiated, gave six pointed and logical
reasons why he considered himselil
more beautiful titan any other
member of the club. After these
revelations and the regular initia~
tion ceremonies. be was admitted
as an active member of the club.
