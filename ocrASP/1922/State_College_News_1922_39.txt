DISCOVERY OF ELEC-
TRIC WELDING

By Alfred D. Flinn
Engineering Foundation

In I887, Professor Elihu Thom-
son delivered at the Franklin Insti-
tutu, Philadelphia. live lectures on
clzcirieity. The object of the Ice-
turt-s and the demonstrations,
which latter were numerous, and
many of them original even to the
employment of special apparatus
constructed by the lecturer, was to
show clearly that electricity, of
whatever name, was the same, dif-
fering only in tension (as it was
termed) and in the current ﬂowing,
or quantity, in steadiness or wave-
Iikc character. In those days, the
text-hooks divided the subject into
statical and dynamic electricity,
with sub-divisions such as friction-
al electricity, voltaic electricity,
magneto clsctricity, clectmmagncb
ism., tht-rmo electricity, and animal
electricity. The well-known ltuhm—
korff coil. or spark coil, as it is now
called (as when used for the igni-

 

tion of automobiles), was employed
to step up a batter current to a
high-tension disc large which
would change condensers, such as
Leyden jars.

Having made such demonstra-
tions. the lecturer conceived the
idea of reversing the precess,
charging some large Leyden jars
by a power-driven static machine.
and then arranging to pass the dis-
chargc of this large Lcydcn jar
condenser through tlllc tins wire, or
secondary winding, of the ignition
coil. The primary of such coil
(which was. of course, of heavy
gage) had its terminals disengaged
and put lightly into contact. It
was found on the discharge of the
condenser through the line wire
that these ‘heavy primary wires
stuck together pernianeutiy. They
had IlCt‘Il wt'ltlcd hy the passage of
a practically instantaneous dis-
charge of a very heavy current. In
modern language it may he said
that the condenser current, which

. was out: of cxtrei‘ucly high vohagc

and small Ilow (perhaps only a
fraction of an ampere), had hecu
transformed down, producing in
the primary a current of only a few
volts, hut of great strength in ani—
percs, so that the instantaneous lo-
cal heating of the ends of the pri-
mary coil. which were in contact,
brought them to the point of fusion,
and union took place.

Such an ohscrvation made liy mit-
who was payingr little attention to
possi‘hililit-s might have escaped
notice. Not so with the lecturer.
He at once saw the possibilities of
transforming a high—voltage current
down to reduced voltage. and calls-
lug thei'cliy the union of metals.
He had, in fact, the conception, in
a crude way it is true, of what lin-
ally ltccaiiic his process of electric
welding. l'revciited Iiy many dc<
mantis on time from carryng this
simple suggestion further. llc con-
stantly I)Ul't: it in mind, and on the
inception of the business which
afterwards hecamc the large Thom-
lsnn-lltttlslnn enterprise, he dis-
cussed the pussiliility of prucct-d»
inn’ with electric welding.

[u ll‘lOS, the opportunity cam;- to
complete the conception of the
earlier days. An alternating cur-
rent generator being at disposition,
it was only necessary to construct
an induction coil or transformer, in
which the primary was of many
turns adapted to the output of the
generator, while the sccoudary had
only Very low turns, but the section
of which was so large that a great
ﬂow of current was possihlc. (on-
nccted to the heavy secondary tar-
niinals was a set of clamps for hold-
ing pieces of metal to be welded.
The projecting portions of these
metal bars were brought together
with some pressure and the current
tttrnctl‘ou by closing the switch iti
the primary. there being,' arrange-
ments for regulating the amount of
primary current flowing. The very
heavy. low-voltage current in the
secondary immediately ‘hcated the
metal pieces at their junction, so
that they softened and united. Thus
were the first electric welds made,
and thus also the original sugges—
tionuluring the scientific demon-
strations at the Franklin Institute
bore fruit, ﬁnally becoming the basis
of the enormous extension in weld-
ing now existing. The modest ap-
paratus was soon followed hy weltl~
'ng transformers for large work;
those were tlhe first transformers in
which the secondary constituted
only a single turn. a characteristic
of most of the welding transform-
crs of to-day.

He: "I love the good, the trite,
the beautiful, the innocent."
c: “This is rather sudden, but
I think lathe-r will consent.”-— Ex
