OUR AMUSEMENTS

 

Only a few days ago some one
was heard to remark, "The students
of State College ought not to have
to spend much time in attending
low-grade amusements in Albany
when they have so many advan-
tages right here.”

:\nd when one stops to think of
it, isn’t it quite true .

liirst. think of the comparatively
small amount that one has to pay
for student tax tickets in com-
parison with the high-class things
that we can attend by just showing
that little ticket and often by not
even doing that.

More than one person gasped
over the prospects of attendng the
London String Quartet for nothing.

The concert which the Music As-
sociation itself have was of no
small interest and afforded all
those who were wise enouin to
go a far pleasanter evemnpr than
tin-.Grand could have done.

Then there were the line plays
which the Dramatics and Art .\5-
sociation .put on. The lighting
effects and the costumes would
make one think that he was sitting
at the Hall watching Minna (jombel
do her best bit of acting. The
music furnished by the college
orchestra was certainly as good as
the orchestra that we hear at
llarmanus.

The latest privilege which has
been brought to our attention is
the exhibit of paintings which have
been making our halls anything
but bare and unattractive. One
could go other places and see
things just as good. but he couldn't
go out between classes with his
friends and enjoy talking them
over.

 

A PROPOSITION

 

How many of you are boy
scouts or girl scouts? Even if you
aren't you've often heard their “Do
a good turn. daily." Ifanyone has
had a job to ﬁnd one of these good
turns to do, here’s a suggestion.
There’s going to be a selfish reason
behind it, but nevertheless it will

 

answer its purpose. You all know
Mary Callahan and the rest. don't
you? Well, they get awfully tired

’of running around after us and

picking up all ,the papers and
trash that we leave lying around.
Here’s the propositionl Let's help
the janitors and janitrcsses out a
bit and at the same time make our
college buildings look neater. The
basement anrl the gym are the
places that suffer most. it’s hard
for the gym teachers to keep the
gym ‘as they'd like to have it
when people in their hurry leave
the remains of lunches behind
them.

Yes. the News (idiot: is an eye-
sore sometimes, lmt we're going
to try the good turn stunt too.

 

AMERICAN TEACHERS

divisions, which usually coincides
with the boundary of a province, is
divided into districts composed of
several towns. The head of the dis-
trict is called the supervising
teacher. He is the direct rcpre~

scntative of the superintendent.

The Philippine public school sys-
tem is patterned after that of the
l'nited States: we have the ole»
mentary school. the high school.
and the university. The courses of
study are mndilied to meet our
needs. industrial work. gardening
and agriculture are included. ln
vocational education much atlen~
tion is given to agriculture. in as
much as the prosperity of the
islands depends upon it. “’0 have
several regular agricultural schools
in different p s f’hysiml educa-
tion is introduce for the children
it is mostly ralesthenics and group
.tz‘alltes. and for older boys and
girls. athletic sports as luv-ball.
tennis. volley ball. indoor baseball,
basketball. high jumping. hurdles.
and other track events. Baseball w :
lirst introduced by the Americ
soldiers. and it has become the
national game. Annual champion-
ship contests are held in each
province, and the winners in each
province compete in the inter—
islands carnival championship.
livery two years the Far Eastern
Olympiad is held, in which the best
athletes of hina, Japan and the
Philippines test their strength.

:\u interesting phase of the edu-
cational progrch is the co-cduca-
tional system. Before, a woman’s
education was composed of read-
ing. writing. simple arithmetic.
and embroidery. ller sphere of
inﬂuence was largely limited to the
borne. The only government posi-
tion opened to her was teaching.
Now. she studies pharmacy. law,
medicine. dentistry, and is taking
nearly all kinds of work in the
government. She participates in
discussion of social and political
problems. She takes an active part
in social work. Women's clubs,
mothers” leagues. and other socie-
ties have been organized. There is
now a movement to give them the
right of the ballot. As to the
capacity of our women let me
quote Miss Yule. who for several
years taught in the Philippines.
“Possibly on these lovely isles.
where the lotus blooms and the
cocoanut lifts high its green-
crowned head. there may be
evolved the 'height of the vision of
the stiﬁragette. a land of perfect
sex equality with chivalry tipping
the scale in favor of the lovely
woman."

We always think highly, with a
feeling of deep gratitude, for the
loyal American teachers who'lcft
all that was dear to them in the
United States to carry the Western

A FABLE BY AESOP. JR.

 

Once upon a time. when the gods
ruled the earth, they endowed each
man with a certain gift. nd one
day they gave to a certain man the

gift of great wind power; and they

said to themselves, " He will be of
great value to the race of men be-
cause he can run long distances
for them. and save life by his long
endurance. But the man did not
wait for such an opportunity, he
became impatient and walked long
by the river planning his future.
He found one day a stiff leaf, and
he made of it a horn. “Now,”
thought he, " l may use my talent."
Rejoicing. he went home, using his
new instrument. And in the streets
all day long. he played. And be-
hold. a child fell in the river. and
people rushed to the man and cried,
“Save him!" lint the man. when
he saw them comingV toward him.
thought, “ Let them hear my prow-
ess,” and he played so loudly that
he did not hear the cries.

And again. there was a great
battle, and the land was in need of

.for me."
the king apprdach, thought, “ Even

a manager. The king came unto
the man and said. “I pray thee,
thou canst run; run to..procure aid
But the man. as he saw

the king is drawn near by my
horn." And he'played louder than
ever before. And there was ruin
in the kingdom for they had failed
to get aid. But the man saw it not
and played in the streets. Whereat
the gods were angry and said,
“Mayhap he must listen to us; we
shall give him one chance to leave
ruin." So the messenger of the
gods came to him and said. "The
gods send for you to play on
Olympus. Comel" But the man
blew the harder when he saw some-
one approach him, and heard not
the voice, And when the messen-

ger had returned, he told that the

man had not listened. Therefore,
the gods smiled. and Zeus gave dew
crce, " Let him be bereft of his
power that he may see the ruin on
earth.” And the scribe in writing:
opposite his name in the book of
men, wrote, beginning. “He that
bloweth his own hm'n—-"

“ Y ” HOUSE

 

. The ” Y " House is very glad to
welcome Verna Carter. ’25, as one

Frances Lawrence, ’21. was a
guest at the “ \' " llouse over the
week end.

"[‘he Y. \‘V. girls extend their
sympathy to Nellie Maxim. '24. on
the death of her grandmother,

The following people have been
pledged to Omicron Nu: Mrs.
Mustainc, Dorothy linker. Grace
McGuire. and Victoria Peterson.

To the Editor of the “News:"

isn't it remarkable what a faculty
people have for arriving at absurd
conclusions and convincing them-
selves that their deductions are
quite correct? Tsually we can
blame this to either carelessness
and laziness in gathering enough
actual facts to really test their
ﬁnal conclusion. or to the uncon«
scious habit of drawing the conclu-
sion they like best from their sur<
vey of conditions. If a man has
looked at only half the evidence he
can collect, he is likely to form a
judgment only half just.

In the old reading books there
used to be a poem of the blind men
who went to "see " an elephant at
the 200. The ﬁrst felt of his trunk.
and cried, “ The elephant is
mighty like a tree!" Another felt
his ear. and cried, “This wondrous
animal is very like a fan! ". A third
fell against the clephant’s side and
exclaimed,' hy. the beast‘ is
nothing but a wall!” 50 they all
fell to arguing over the matter, be-
cause no one of them was seeing
the elephant as a whole. '

 

And again, you know the story
of the woman who refused to ho
lieve that the circus-man was right
because she had always thou}. it of
a kangaroo as about the size of a
rabbit, and she preferred to con-
tinue thinking: so.

Now. aren't a good many con-
clusions and generalizatimis made
by the student hotly of State Col-
lege about the student body of
State College about as unjustilicd
as these? Without callingr names.
or beingr impolite. let me ask you
if you are sure that all the state-
ments made about honor systems.
and dormitories. and lack of college
spirit are carefully based onvdelinitc
and complete statistics, or may
they not possibly be a bit weak as
to underpinning? Maybe we‘d ar-
rive at the same conclusions event-
ually, but wouldn’t We feel a good
deal more justiﬁed in those con-
clusions if We could only say, llOll<
estly, “There! These facts say

i this; those facts say the contrary; ‘
they are Impartially and most care-

fully collected; these outweiin
those. and. therefore. i conclude
t-hus and 50.” Let’s be a little more
careful about our imdcrpinniinu.
