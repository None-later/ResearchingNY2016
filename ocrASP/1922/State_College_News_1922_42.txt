Chemistry Club

The regular meeting of the
Chemistry Club was held Wednes-
day evening, March 8, in the Chem-
istry lecture room. Professor
llroiison gave a talk on vitamines.
Those who were unable to attend
will probably he interested in a
few extracts from his lecture.

l"01‘ll1L‘l'l_\' I'ats, carbohydrates and
protei alone were considered
necessary for diet, although under
conditions of restriction scurvy and
other diseases of dietitional origin
developed. 111 l’rancc when scurvy
developed among soldiers lemon
juice was added to the diet and
was found to help prevent the dis
ease. Later, in the East. doctors
found that rice polishings cured
beri beri, :\.s a result the workers
turned to study what food princi»
ples were able to cure beri bcri and
scurvy. They found ycast would
cure both diseases and called these
principles in yeast vitaminc. Two
food principles were found to be
necessary for growth, that found
largely in milk, butter and fat is
called vitaminc A, and that in green
vegetables and fruits is called vita—
mine B. while the vi-tamine which
cures scurvy is called vitamiine C.

investigation has shown that
only a small amount of food con-
taining vitaminc is necessary to
produce growth or overcome dis-
ease. Indeed, an almost inﬁnitesi-
mal amount of cod liver oil which
contains vitaminc A was found to
overcome the eye disease and
stunted growth which resulted

 

   

 

 

 

 

 

from an epidemic among the chil-
dren of central Europe. Fresh

vegetables are also rich in this»

vitamine.
Kappa Delta

Kappa Delta announces the pur-
chase of her home at 380 Western
Avenue. and it is believed that the
cause of dormitories at State Col-
lege has made a distinct advance-
ment in the actual purchase of one
sorority house. The Alumnae, or-
ganized in the New York City and
Capital District Branches have
taken the responsibility and made
this possible. Miss ’attie Stuart,
1919, l'residcut of the Capital Dis-
trict Alumnae Association has
acted as chairman of the House
I’urchnse t‘onimiitee, and rightfully
gains the appreciation of the active
chapter. The other members of
the committee are:

AMERICAN TEACHERS

ideals of civilization to its. One
has to encounter the tropical cli—
mate. the different environment.
the people, language, and social
condition. it was especially hard
for the pioneer, who was sent to
the most remote parts of the
islands, where he himself could
only understand his own language,
or his only countryman neighbor,
about twenty or thirty miles from
his place. i remember quite well
back in 1903, while 1 was in a
neighboring town of my home
town, an American had just ar-
rived in that place to teach. I was
in the municipal building, when the
American tried to explain to the
“Presidente” or the town-head,
his plan and something that he
would like to have done in the
school building before starting the
class. He was talking with a vest-
pocket English-Spanish dictionary
in his right hand, and made all
kinds of gestures and modiﬁcations
of his English words to make them
sound like Spanish, But all was in
vain; there the " President: " stood.

 

with his mouth open. I was then
picked up by the “Presidentc” to
act as an interpreter. 1‘ was in the
second grade at that time, so one
can imagine how mueh help I was
able to give.

The method of teaching- among
the pioneers was from the “un-
known to the known.” rather than
following the well-known peda-
gogical principle from the " known
to the unknown." When 1 was in
the lirst grade the first object i
learned was an apple. which was
the center of interest in l’ialdwin's
First Reader. Then I learned the
cherries, snow. and squirrels. All
of them were strange to me, Then
gradually texts suited to our con-
dition were written, The snow
melted and the apples and cherries
(listippearetl; bananas and oranges
took their plac s. A series on
“ l‘hilippine History aiid Civil Gov-
ernment" and readers now in usu
for elementary grades are written
by Filipino authors, products of
the public school.

Another great dilliculty of the
pioneers was train assistants. The
proc s resorted to at first was that
of "take and ,Lrive." 1n the alter-
nooii the teacher taught the as-
sistants; the next morning the lat-
lt‘l‘ taught what they got. Then
regular teacher training,r agencies
were intrmlurcd. Summer insti-
tutes for teachers were held: a
normal course was given, both in
the intermediate school and in the
high school: resin ar normal
schools \\'t‘l'L' established; and then
llll' (‘ollcuc of Education in the
University of lllt' l’hilippines was
created. According to the latest
figures I know we have now illmttt
20,000 Filipino teachers and over
51)” Americans teaching in 6.886
public schools, with a total enroll-
ment of 935.678.

Spanish is dying,r in the Philip-
pines. English is taught exclu-
sively in the l'llllipplllt: public
schools, and the private schools
rccnrnizer )y tic government
class s are conducted in English,
with one or no subject in Span—
ish. There are two million people
now who can read and write ling-
lish. An American or any Eng-
lish~speaking person does not need
to bring his English—Spanish (lic-
tionary in travelling over the
Philippines. The young,r generation
cannot speak Spanish. it is not
the language in our homes; it is
used in social, official. and business
circles, among the older genera-
tion to a very limited extent.
English is destined to be the na—
tional language in the Philippines.
Ten years later the Philippine
legislature will be composed
wholly of the products of the pub-
ic schoo s. in fact. at present
there are several such holdingr re-
sponsible positions in the govern—
ment, with ten in the legislature.
ft is interesting to note that when
the government sent its ﬁrst 100
students to the United States in
1905 the highest attainment among
that few was not even the comple—
tion of the high school. Now. of
over 150 government students, al-
most all of them are taking post-
graduate courses in your leadingv
universities, \Ve have also about
2,000 private students in the States.

The University of the Philip-
pines is a government institution.
run under a special charter. it
was established twelve years tion
with a handful of students in the
School of Medicine. which served
as a nucleus. Now it has grown
up to an institution with six col-
leges and seven schools with about
5,000 students. There are students
from lChina. India, and Siam,
