STATE COLLEGE NEWS,

MARCH 13,: 1922

 

as to the expenses for the main-
tenance of the. Philippine govern-
ment. The country is sci -sup-
porting. The United States has not
given any ﬁnancial support, except
the'maintenance of the army and
the keeping up of the naval
stations. .

The influence of the Philippine
public schools is not conﬁned to its
boundaries, but reaches to the
noighoring Oriental countries. Ed-
,itca'tional missions were sent by
Corea, China, and Javata study the
system. There are ,It‘iltpinio teach--
ers employed by the government of
Java.

AS to the progress of the .I'liilip-
pine public schools, Dr. Paul Mun—
roe, of Columbia University, after
his personal, thorough investiga-
tion of the conditions there, af-
Iirmed that “greater educational
rogress has been made in the
l’hilippine islands in ten or twelve
years than in any place in the
history of education."

In order to understand the cause
of such rapid development, the
proper foundation is to be noted.
lleiore the Philippines became an
American possession there were
2,000 “rudimentary public schools,"
scmiuarics, colleges, and a uni-
versity. The University of Santo
Tomas is twenty-live years older
than llarvard, the oldest American
university. It can be said. there-
fore. when America occupied the.
islands she found a people ready
for the educational s) tum that she
was to establish. She did not lind
a savage people, but a nation
eager to learn and anxious to
t‘o-opcrate.

 

NEW EXAMINATIONS
FOR COLUMBIA MEN

Essay Type of Tests to Be Sup—
plemented by a Closer Delv—
ing for Facts

Steps have been taken by Colum-
bia College to modify the character
of examinations in many depart-
ments. Side by side with the
traditional essay type of examina-
tion a new aid has been introduced,
which, accordng to Dean l-lerbert
E. l'lawkes, affords no chance for
the bluffer to exercise his arts and
removes the examination from the
category of sporting propositions.

“The clever student." says the
Dean, "whose verbose knowledge of
a few topics can be stretched so as
to appear to advantage whatever
questions may be asked, is left
stratified. With the new examina-
tion he is shooting with a riﬂe in»
stead of a shotgun."

Columbia’s departure was the
outcome of conditions said to pre-
vail generally in American colleges
and schools. and of which Ben D.
Wood. assistant to Dean l-lawkes,
said recently: “It is a notorious
fact that college grades and high
school marks are highly inaccurate
and unreliable." Mr. Wood said his
conclusions were based upon ex-
tensive researches at Columbia and
other universities.

Columbia’s plans to meet the sit-
uation were contained in a report
by Dean Hawkes to President
Nicholas hitxrray Butler. given
out last week. Owing to,the vat—
iation among instructors in deter“-
mininr,r the grades 'of students, in at,
tempting to compare the results of
the mental tests with the college

marks, Columbia is using a scale .

only 70 per cent. accurate.

 

“Hence a correlation of more
than 70 per cent. between the col-
lege grades and anything else
would be a chance result and with-
out signiﬁcance,’ says Dean
Hawkcs. “Since We now have a
correlation of 65 per cent. with the
mental tests it appears that We
have proceeded nearly as far in
this direction as is possible until
the grading system has been im~
proved.

“Not only is the present system
of grading unsatisfactory on ac-
count of the variation due to the
personal equation noted above, but
also owing to the fact that there
is no agreement. even among mem-
hers of the same department in the
same institution. as to what they
are trying to measure, what units
they propose to use, and where
the zero point should be placed.
Figures giving the accuracy of the
grades in certain courses in tfolnm-
liia College have been prepared ac-
cording to principles accepted by
those most familiar with such
matters.

"it appears that the accuracy
of the marks during the year 1919-
1920 of a large number of students
ran from 35 to 68 per cent. in
the various departments. while the
accuracy of the combined 'r'ide
tor the entire work of a session
is 70 per cent. Consequently, in
attempting to compare the results
of the mental test with the college
marks. we are using a scale that Is'
only 70 per cent. accurate. Hence,
a correlation of more than 70 per
cent. between the college grades
and anythingr else would be a
chance result and without signiﬁ-
cance. Since we now have a cor-
relation oi (.5 per cent. with the
mental tests it appears that we have
proceeded nearly as far in this (li-
re'ton as is possible until the
or bug system has been im-
proved.

“This difﬁculty has been attacked
by modifying the character of our
exallninatious. The kind oi exam—
ination which has been uniformly
used in the more descriptive sub-
jects like history and economies
may heldt‘SL‘t‘ibt-d as the essay type.
 relatively small number of qucs»
tions are presented to the student
who IS. supposed to write a little
essay m answer to each of the
questions, all duringr the two or
three hours of the examination
period. Any one who has spent
days and nights in reading: the re-
sults of this process does not need
to be informed regarding the com-
plexities of the problem of grad-
int: the student.

"it is probable that in the essay
type-of examination there is a
margin of error of from if) to 25
per cent. which is entirely elimr
mated in the new examination.
hurtlicrmore, the new cxamina
tron CDvcrs the course to an extent
utterly impossible in the essay
type."

  
 

The young,’ man walked down the
street, one shoe off and his coat
turned inside out. :\ policeman
stopped him.

“What‘s the idea?" he demanded.

.“Well, you see, it’s this way.” rc~
plied the young man. “I’m taking
a course at a correspondence school
and yesterday those darn sopho—
mores wrote to me-and-told me to
haze myself."—-Thc Owl.
