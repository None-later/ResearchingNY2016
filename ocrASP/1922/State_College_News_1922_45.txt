He must indeed be blind and (leaf
and seclude on a desert island who
will not know by next week. at
least, of the all—important signifi-
cance of April l—to us at State
College, we mean. in contrast to
our unfortunate above mentioned
friend, the rest of us know that
April 1 is the date for the long
heralded Alumni Bazaar.

By the first enthusiastic an-
nouncement in student assem-
bly and the recent information
gained from the busy student com-
mittees and from last week’s paper
and today's front sheet, we are be-
ing subjected to the most luring
advertismg process now known.
And the reason that all of the in-
ducements sound so attractive is
because the products behind them
actually are so.

But then—everyone knows a
project is worth while when OUR
FACULTY and OUR ALUM‘N’I
are back of it.

 

CLEAN UP WEEK
March 20-24

Spring is herel The Spring
winds are blowing; the Snow is al-
most gonc; somebody said that
somebody saw a robin in the park.
The superintendents are intchiew-
ing the seniors. the freshmen have
a longing eye on Spring vacation
and billet-doux will soon be out.
The red maples are out. pussy w1l-
lows are out—and—ﬁnat confirma-
tion of the arrival of Spring—
Spring hats are out! .

Alasl The alluring and unsus-
pecting little Spring hat that comes
gaily and trust ully into S. T. C. on

 

the head of a frisky litllc fresh-
man or a soluble senior, does not
quite know the dire fate that may
await it. To repose long hours in
a gloomy locker, on a lovely April
day in company with Augell's .l'sy-
ehology and a batch of old themes
is a bit depressing. but if added to
that there. are lunches from last
November, some passe shoes,
towels, blouses and stockings that
would make a llttl‘(l>l)0llL‘ll Ianndress
blush—well. it is too much!

[int to return to the mouse—if
he is a plain vulgar ordinary mouse
(musca domestlea) he will out the
lunch rulgarly and blissfully, if he
is a scientitie mouse tmnsca scien—
tiliea) he will eat your psychology
——yon might not grieve so mnch~
though you are supposed to have
one. If he " a brave. courageous
mouse (mus l ——-—? I”) he will eat
your themes and that would not
matter at all~——but, if he is an artis—
lic mouse (unisra artistica‘) he may
eat your Spring lint.

In order to avoid such calamities

as the foregoing. a student-Iarulty
‘ 'ited March

 
 

 

 

eouunittee has
20-24 as Clean Up \\ ,ek at S. 'l. t,
lly Friday, March 24. let every one
have his locker so iunnaculatc that
the, most fragile Spring hat or the
most exquisite Spring poem could
reside therein safely and ill!-
molested.
Come on, everybody. let's
CLEAN UP!

IF

ll's peculiar how some things
seem to be "catching" just like the
measles. the whooping cough, etc.
——contagi(ius do they call it?

A week or two ago in Chancel-
lor‘s Hall the movie, A Man With—
out a Country was shown. At some
time during the performance a pic‘
ture of Abraham Lincoln was
llashed on the screen. A group of
boy scouts who \vere present im-
mediately on sight of the great
patriot became so enthusiastic that
they aroused the entire audience.
The auditoriqu fairly shook. and it
was only a short time before every
person present felt at least a part
of that enthusiasm that the boys
showed. This is only one of the
examples of the way in which pop
and enthusiasm rims throughout a
crowd of people. If it works in a
theatre where we are thrown in
with a poppy audience for the space
of only an hour or two, what would
be the result if we actually associ-
ated with an equally enthusiastic
crowd every (lay in the week, four
weeks in a month, and nine months
in a year? What would be the re
suit in State College?

 

FACULTY NOTES

 

Dr. Brubacher has received from
Nicholas Murray Butler, chairman
of the National Committee of the
United States for the Restoration
of the University of Louvain. a
letter asking faculty and student
aid in a nation-wide movement to
collect. through small subscriptions.
money for the completion of a new
library building at Loiivain. Colv
uinbia University has already in-
augurated a movement fashioned
after the plan used in France which
limited individual subscriptions to
one “sou,” but which netted over
200,000 francs. With the National
Committee of the United States.
Cardinal Mercicr feels that once the
students of America back this
movement the plans for the com-
pletion of the library may be made.

On Monday there will be a fac-
ulty council meeting in Dr. Bru-
bacher's oﬁice.

 

A FABLE BY AESOP. JR.

 

Once upon a time. in the land of
long ago, there was a maiden who
was appointed hand-maiden to the
queen of the kingdom. Now the
hand-maiden loved the pleasures of
the land very much, and she dis-
liked to remain in the kingdom all
the day and wait upon the queen.
'l‘licrefore, one day, she said unto
the queen "My kinswomnu in the
next kingdom is very ill. lt is meet
that I should go to her to minister
unto her." And the queen took
pity on the plight of her hand
maiden and linde her go. And the
handouaideu went unto the house
of her kiuswonian, and there she
enjoyed much pleasure and forgot
the wiles by which she had gained
her freedom. And after she had
wasted many hours. she returned
unto the queen. and. when asked,
said, “My kiuswolnan is better."

.v\ud again one day. she wasted
her time and did not the, task set
for her by the queen. And when
the queen questioned her cnuceru~
ing the task. she suddenly became

 

wan and faint and murmured, “My‘
n

queen. l have of. I . t n( the
queen, liudiug in her face weariness.
excused her from the task.

After this build-maiden had done
this many times, the queen became
wearii-il of the excuse, and the
haml-iuaiden found that she must
do her tasks. ltui there came to
her mind another way. When the
queen questioned her concerning
her tasks, she smiled and made cou-
versation with the queen about
other tasks and that task also. but
not what she had done toward it.
And the queen said unto her ,
"She likes her tasks; she speaks
of more than I a. .

:\ud the lmud-uiaiden did so all
her days, but when slut came to the
judgment soul of the gods. Zens
looked steriin at her. And he gave
couuuand, saying. “Let this liaud-
inaitlen set about to liuish all those
tasks she should have done on
em h, and let her thereafter always
linish her t' " And the scribe in
writng opposite her name in the
book of men. smiled as he wrote,
ltt‘RlltlllllH,"5l1t' that putleth it over
on the facultym“
