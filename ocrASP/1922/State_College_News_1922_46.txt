A Gateway—Electrical

ONLY a forty-foot gateway bounded
by two brick pilasters and ornamen-
tal lamps, but it is unlike any other gate-
way in the entire world.

For back of it is the General Electric
Company's main ofﬁce building, accom-
modating 2300 employees. And just next
door is its main laboratory with the
best equipment for testing, standardizing
and research at the command of capable
engineers. Then down the street a mile
long—are other buildingswhere electrical
products are made by the thousands of
electrical workers who daily stream
through.

Gene

Through this gate messages and repre-
sentatiVes from a score of other factories
and over ﬁfty branch ofﬁces come and go
every hour—an endless chain of co-ordi-
nated activities carrying on and enlarg-
ing the scope of over a quarter century’s
work for the betterment of mankind.

What a story this gate would tell, if it
could, of the leaders of the electrical in-
dustry and of ambassadors from other
industries and institutions—and from
foreign lands. The storyWUuld be the his-
tory of electric lighting. electric trans-
portation, electriﬁed industrials and
electricity in the home.

BOBBED HAIR

 

Backward. turn backward. 0 time
in your flightl

 

I can stand almost anything—cold,
hunger, and thirst,

Toothache. and carachc. and lots
of things worse.

I can stand being cheated, swindled,
and robbed.

But I cannot endure a girl whose
hair's bobbed.

I don't care if she's cross‘cycd,
freckled. or fat,

Sixteen or thirty, does her hair on
a rat.

Tall. short, or indifferent, homely
or air,

I'll put up with 'most anything, if
she liaSn't bobbed hair.

I can even endure galos‘hes that

ﬂop.
Dresses short at the bottom and
short at the top,

 

But the girl with bobbed hair is no
{rieml‘of mine.

I do not approve of paint or
of powder.

Smoking, or talk which . grows
coarser and louder.

But'if I were to choose and choose
fair and square

I’d prefer girls with these faults to
those with bobbed hair.

I inlay be particular and fussy, but

t en

You’ll ﬁnd it is so with all sensi—
le men.

Already they give me a pain in my
liver.

If.thcy.all bob their hair 1'" go
Jump in the river.

The Wandering Poet.
