TWO MORE GAMES

present at these games. It is one
of the very few times when State
College students are asked to pay
at the College functions and should
be heartily supported. The eve-
ning’s fun will be worth far more
than the prICe of admission, and‘
besides it may be the last basket-
ball game at which the present stu-
dents of Sta-to will have a chalice
to cheer for their own College
teams. This is a line chance to
show a heap of 'Collcgc spirit. Take

advantage of it!

High School,

Other proposed plans as outlined
by Dr. A. R. Brubachcr, president
of the State College, call for the
erection of a building to be used
as the College library. At present
the library in the College. building
is so limited that space cannot be
found to keep all the necessary
books for students’ usn.

.In addition it is planned, if a
sufficient appropriation is granted,
to build a new gymnasium for the
College, the present one being
inadequate.

Final plans for lhc dormitory
campaign are being made by the
committee headed by Professor
,Iohn M. Saylcs, principal of the
Milne High School. The goal of
the campaign to be carried on dur-
ing the latter part of May is set at
$300,000. to be contributed by mem-
bers of the alumni association and
others interested in the College.
A fund has been raised by the com~
mitten to carry on the publicity
work.

CAGEBALL GAMES

The freshmen were again victori-
ous in cageball when they won from
the seniors, onday afternoon at
ﬁve. Although the freshmen out-
numbered the seniors, the game was
very exciting. On account of the
large number of their players, the
freshmen were able to keep fresh
players on the floor. Florence Bohne
acted as referee. The score was
21-15. ‘

The freshmen lost their ﬁrst game
Wednesday afternoon when they
battled with the juniors. At the end
of the first half the score was 10-8
in favor of the freshmen. There
was spectacular playing on the part
of Margaret ,Hutchins, Mildred
Blevins, and May Wood. Margaret
Hutchins scored several points in
quick succession for the juniors. The

'freshincn made a good showing, but

they lacked strength. The teams
were evenly matched. The ﬁnal
score was 21-13 in favor of the
juniors. The referee was Florence
Bohnc.

ELECTRIC CLOCKS IN
BIG HOTEL

[installation has just been made by
the General Electric ‘Company of

the Warren electric clock system

in the annex to the Plaza hotel in
New York. This represents the
ﬁrst hotel in New York in which
this system of regulating clocks
has been utilized. It is the second
installation of the sort in any hotel,
the lirst having been made last year
in the Ritz-Carlton hotel at Atlan-
tic Cit, where the clocks have
been t1 us regulated with much
success for the last seven months.

In the Plaza installation there
are about 50 clocks, located in the
main rooms. in the foyers, salons,
drawing rooms and dining rooms.
They are operated by small gener-
ators which convert the direct eur-
rcnt of the hotel’s lighting circuit
into ,alternating current for the
purpose of lihe clock system. The
converters, the master clock and
bile control panel are all located in
the telephone exchange of the
hotel on the first floor.

Tiny motors. so small that one
of thcm easily nestles in the palm
of the hand are geared to the dial
'hands of each of the secondary
clocks connected with the system.

These small motors, which take the‘

place of the usual intricate clock
mechanism and which are of the
synchronous type, will operate the
hands of clocks of any size. Rig
clocks wivh dials five feet in dianh
cter and little clocks with dials
whose diameters are only three
inches are regulated equally well
by these smallest of motors. none
of the dimensions of which excced
three inches.

Absolutely uniform time is
shown by every clock of the sys-
tem at a given moment. The sys-
tent is also self-regulating, and
therefore iinlcpcndcnt of voltage or
frequency fluctuations incident to
the power lines from which it
draws its current.

The master clock cxcrciscs con-
stant control over the power gener—
ating apparatus which drives the
individual motors of the secondary
Clocks. This control by the
master clock enables all the secon—
dary clocks to keep accurate time.

hey are never more tihan three
seconds slower or faster than the
master clock.

The reliability of this ‘systcm. as
revealed in actual service. is be-
lieved to bring prominently to the
front this novel idea of thus elec-
trically operating clocks for hotels,
office buildings, manufacturing
plants and institutions where it is
desired to have a large number of
clocks and to insure that they will
all keep accurate and uniform time.

“ GIDDY ” TEACHERS
TABOO

 

IIUSItOII, Iieh. 22.-"Giddily attired”
teachers, with hair and skirts cut
short and with evidence of rouge
and lipstick, are not wanted by
school superintendents, according
to representatives of the Eastern
'I‘eachers’ Agency.

The school employment manager

sai :

“We do not encourage the behind
hair applicant for a teacher's posi—
tion. nor the one who uses make-up
and dresses conspicuoust when she
tries to register with us. School
superintendents will not employ
them.

"Above all. women teachers must
have the good sense to dress them-
selves in accordance with modesty
and good taste. They must be, an
example in this, as in everything
elscc'to the"girls'and ‘hoys whom
they are to teach and discipline."
