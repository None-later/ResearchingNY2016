BOOST

The past week has been observed
at college as Clean Up Week. All
the rubbish that had gathered dur-
ing six and one-half months of col~
lege life has been thrown out. and,
as a result. there is a fresher, bright-
er atmosphere around. Have you
ever thought,- that this Cleaning up
process could be extended further?

During the many weeks lliat we
have worked and played here there
has been a gradual accumulation of
worthless mental rubbish. Things
have gone wrong, games have been
lost, unpleasant events have oc-
curred. Each little fault or griev—
ance has been stored up until now
there is quite an accumulation. But,
what good is the old stuff anyway?
\V’hen you come right down to
facts, it is no good and never was
any good.

Now it is spring, and everything
is rosy. Win not cast all the gloom
away and start out thinking good
of everybody and everything? Stop
knocking and begin boosting. if
anything is wrong don’t howl about
it, but get out and work. Then
things will come out right. Each
one of us will better enjoy the life
when We can honestly feel that our
little push is helping to make con-
ditions better.‘

Spring sports and contests are
about to begin. In a few weeks
the ﬁrst baseball game will take
place. Then there is the dormitory
drive and numerous other oppor-
tunities for the booster. With 650
boosters State College will be on
the map in suchblg letters that no
one can miss it. College life at
State can’t be beat anywhere. We
all know it. Tell the good news to
the rest of' the world.

SPEED

 

In the ﬁrst issue of this semester
we called attention to the fact that
it was a ﬁne time to make a new

 

There is only one thing that can
compare with a flying start and that
is a brilliant finish. As vacation
draws nig‘li let its step on the gas
and rush the profs. off their feet.
Let’s throw off our laickad‘aisical
attitude and hit it up. ' Wlil'ilt would
make a better impression on the
“powersdhat-be" than for each and
everyone to coiin-c under the wire
with colors flying and hitting on
all four cylinders.

Therefore be it highly resolved
that we have been going at half
speed all along and that now we
will open 't‘lle cut out and hit noth-
ing but high s‘pots. Old man iner-
cury will look like a snail wading
through a sea of Lol‘agc’s glue
Compared willh us and our speed
during the next two weeks.

 

SPRING FEVER

This is a peculiar malady whioh
strikes hardest at the very young.
The symptoms of the disease are
generally recognizable as they oc-
our in twp forms—moody listless-
iicss or licry exuberance, though
at times an April shower effect dc—
nived from n mingling of the two
has been know to occur.

A student alilictcd with the
moody list . as noted above may
develop individual symptoms of a
peculiar nature. He may feel that
life is but an cmpty drezuii-lie is
glad the end is near. lie is so tired
he cannot long endure the pressure
of mid-years. He may be. “bored
to death” with the boisterous jolli-
liCllliiillS of his one time friend and
go in search of solitude beﬁtting
one "in the world. llllil not of it.”

r\ stud‘ciiit afflicted with the fiery
exuberance of Spring suffers or
makes others stiffer in a different
way. lie sails blit‘liely in and out
of class nnmindiful of the growls,
the taunlts of profs—he is young and
it is spring. He may even be in
Love. Especially, if this last is
true. will lie burst into poetry—the
freer the verse, the lliettcr for oh!
blue is the sky. and gentle is the
wind in Springl

"hose few who have escaped the
malady sigh and wait stoically for
the only relief in sight—Spring va-
ration.

THE CAMPUS

Spring is the time when we are
anxious to have everything about
us harmonious and beautiful. it
is the season of the year when we
are in a hurry to get all our work
done in the shortest possible time
so that we can enjoy the pleasures
of life with a free conscience. Also
in spring the rain and the melting
snow make the ground soft and
muddy, and it yields under the
lightest hurrying foot. All of which
insinuatcs ito State College students
that they must keep their unbal-
lowed fect from our campus While
it is in this impressionable state.
We do not want any deep ugly
scars m r the smoothness of
the gira through the comng
year. T .nre stop to think when
you are rushing madly to an 81l0 or
12 It is no more necessary to
be o‘nwtimc now than in midwinter
when that delectable path across
campus was blocked by drifted
snows.

We hope that, even if this nips
in like bud the resolutions of the
tardy one, it will aid in preserving
the beauty of the campus.

 

A FABLE BY Aesop. pa.

Once upon a time in the land of
long ago there was a young maiden
who was much beloved by her par-
en'tis. And those parents had dread
of the time when she should leave
them; so tilicy, when the other
young maidens and young men
called: to her, said, "Pray remain at
home." And she did remain at
home and knew not the young men
and maidens.

But ithe time came one day when
she was sent forth to a far kingdom
and there there were many young
men and maidens. Now when the
festival time came, the vomit.r maid—
en was ﬁlled with great dread for
she knew not of a companion for
the great festival day. And she
wrote a message to IllCl‘ own king-
dom for a companion at the festival,
but the young men reasoned in their
hearts and said, “We knew ’her not;
she was not at our iestivals: she
knows not the way of a festi 'ii.”
And! they sent iiack word that there

 

was a mighty war in the kingdom
and that [perforce they must fight.
Whercnpon the maiden , in .her
'trouble beseeched tllie other young
maidens to find a companion for
her at the festtiivail. But the other
young inialdens looked upon her dis-
dainfully and said among l‘l‘lC‘ln'
selves, "The young men would be
displeased at its for she knows not
the way of a festival." 50 when
the festival day came, the young
maiden drew near to the festival
and watched, but she had no com-
pnnion.

{\ll‘tl all 'hcr days tiliis young maid-
en drew near and watched festivals
but never found a companion. And
when she came to the judgment
seat of the gods, Zeus pitied her
and said, “Let her be taught in the
way of fest vals and men; then let
her find companions for festivals:
and therefore she shall be happy
on Olympus." And the scrilie, in
writing opposite her name in the
hook of men. wrote beginning:—
"She that lackcth a man for
Soirée "

 

 

SOPHS TO ASSIST
SENIORS

Sing a Feature of the Hop.

.l'lans for the senior hop which will
be held in tile iCollcge gymnasium
on March 31, are progressing rap-
idly iiiiiler llllC direction at Otto, gen-

eral committee: Helen Walsh,
chairman: .\ln-rt‘lia [’arry, li'anny
Sc‘liull-niaii, (ltito Huddle, and
Thomas Bentley.

'l‘hc decorations in blue and

white are going to transform the
gymnasium, through some lltySlCl‘h
OUS process, into a fairy-like forest.
Knowing,r it'lie abilities of the senior
class, it is not doubtin limit the
resulting forest will be oliariiring to
so .\lyerhriff’s orchestra will play
#11!“ the sort of music appropriate
for such a dcliglhltfui setting and
atmosphere.

'l‘iliis year the seniors seem to he

endowed with an extraordinary
genius for planning original and

surprising delights. The most un-
usual of these is the sing in cannery
tinn with the dance. The seniors
are going to sing every one of their
class songs—even those very first
ones which lille learned as' fresh-
men. And in order that vtilieir
guests may enjoy the jolly infor—
inaility of singingr [00, the words of
each song will be flashed on the
wall. Surely none but the seniors
Would lrave thought of such a
unirpie plan for the pleasure of their
guests.

Then. of course. there are the
refreshments. Here again appears
another evidence of the before—men-
tioned originality. They will be
served in none other place than the
cafeteria by thinteeii girls of the
senior’s sister class: Lillian Ersliler,
Katherine Monk, Dorothy Jones.
Elizabeth Naglc, Emily fielding,
Muriel Dagget, Eleanor Abrams.
Wilhelmina l-lcinoma-nn, Mary
Mailier, Marion Miller, Jane Green,
Betty McManus, Helena Borsick.
The substance of the dainties to be
served is kept a dark secret.
However, we know they’ll be good.

The chaperons for the hop will
be Miss Bennett, Miss Scotland and
Miss Phillips.

HOW’S YOUR SPIRIT?

We mean your college
is it a healthy, virile, growing spirit,
ready to boost and support and
cheer, or is it the antithesis of the
splendid thing it should be? lase-
lialil season is opening—the 'Var-
sit‘y team has already begun to
break in. The procession of
parap‘licrn‘aliia has begun. flats and
balls, gloves and masks. uniforms
and shoes, old timers and rookies
are springing up out of the earth
likeitlie proverbial mnyflower. Has
your college spirit called your at-
tention tn tillese indications that
State is preparing to make a name
fiirtlie‘rself iii halls of baseball fame?
Are you interested, alive to the pos-
sibilities and excited over the pros-
pect? Who's out for the team?
Look them over: Captain Jack Mc-
Clu'er, Johnson, llaldwin, Casaret‘tc.

Church goers and stay at homes!
Attention! Tuesday you have an
engagement in the music room at
3 o'clock. Edna Sc‘hafer is going
to start a discussion on What My
Church Means to Me and it is up
to us to follow up the discussion.
Some of the questions are ” Why
do i go to church? ” " Why don’t i
go?" ” Why should i go, even if
i don’t like to?"

The meeting; is to take the form
of a denominational rally, just to
see how many of each denomina-
tion are supporting Y. W. meetings.
Of course your denomination is
helping, for you always come.
Some interesting news about Y. W.
inlcmbersliip will be disclosed, but
if you aren’t there you won‘t know
about it. So come out and support
your own particular church: but,
better still, support your own pair-
