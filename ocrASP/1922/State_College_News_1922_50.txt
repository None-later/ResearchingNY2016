Man/Made Lightning

RANKLIN removed some of the mystery. But
only recently has science really explained the
electrical phenomena of the thunderstorm.

Dr. C. P. Steinmetz expounds this theory. Rain-
drops retain on their surfaces electrical charges,
given off by the sun and other incandescent bodies.
In falling, raindrops combine, but their surfaces do
not increase in proportion. Hence, the electrical
pressure grows rapidly, Finally it reaches the limit
the air can stand and the lightning ﬂash results.

And now we have artiﬁcial lightning. One million
volts of electricity~approximately one ﬁftieth of the
voltage in a lightning ﬂash—have been sent success-
fully over a transmission line in the General Engineer-
ing Laboratory of the General Electric Company.
This is nearly ﬁve times the voltage ever before
placed on a transmission line.

Much valuable knowledge of high voltage phenom-
ena—essential for extending long distance trans-
mission—was acquired from these tests. Engineers
now see the potential power in remote mountain
streams serving in industries hundreds of miles away.

Man-made lightning was the result of ungrudging
and patient experimentation by the same engineers
who ﬁrst sent 15,000 volts over a long distance
thirty years ago.

“ Keeping everlastingly at it brings success.”
It is difﬁcult to forecast what the results of the next
thirty years may be.

To that “Wandening Poet" who
ha-Lcs a ho‘hbe‘d head,

We all can agree that there’s to be
said:

Has he ever inquired w‘hy girls hob
their hair? ,
Has he ‘i)CCll really honest—or quite

fair and square?

When the men cut their 'hair oil in
days long gone by.

Did the women complain of it,
murmur or cry?

When themen wanted comfort and
cleanliness too.

Tid the women all wail, "It's a
wrong thing to do! ! I"

 

Dees a'man really, truly, prefer on

a gir

A snarled up old puff or a short
golden curl?

If experience teaches, take my word

or 1 ,
It's the girl with the bobbed locks
who makes a big hit.

If that Wandering Poet rh‘as “ﬂhiink-
works" at a

Hi5 capacity for using thlcm must
be quite sma ,

For in winter or summer, in fall or
in spring.

A Dutch cut is the really sensible
thing.

Brains aren't determined by puffs.
rats or cur 5,

And the “up to date hobs" a'rc the
capable girls.—-—Con-tri~hutetl.
