COLLEGE GIRLS T0
SPEND VACATIONS
AS APPRENTICES

Try-Out System Devised to Avoid
"Blind-Alley" Jobs.

Baltimore, tMarch 23.-—Ful|y 165
Goucher College girls, leaving to
day for the spring recess, will spend
their vacations as apprentices wit'h
imlnsltrial and professional organi-
zations in *ailtimore and in the
towns and cities OI the 38 states to
which the students are returning.
This method has been adopted by
the Ilureau of Vocational Guidance
and I’laccmcnit, under the super—
vision of Dr. lva l... I'lelters, in order
to prevent haphazard selection of
vocations after graduation, and to
insure the girls from drifting into
"blind-alley" jobs.

Among 227 girls who have ex-
pressed vocational preferences, 90
are said to prefer teaching; 52,
social service; 28, writing or jour-
nalism; 22, business; 22, industrial
chemistry; eight. library work, and
live, agricultural pursuits.

“The introduction of job analysis
into busine. " said Dr. I'cll‘crs to—
day, "is a ecting men and women
in the higher reaches of industry
even more rapidly than is trite in
teaching and social work, Exact
tests oi the abilities needed in busi—
ncs life are put-ting individuals
where they I,N'IOIlf.;', and tin: problem
for the rnllcgi- girl is one of linding
ln'r special gills. II II ' blind-alley
job i' in continue to (:xtst, it must
be res ‘vcd for illrc individual to
whom it represents the limit of
flCVtYIUPIIIl'III. IIU‘IICIILII' College has
discovered that ii the blind—alley
in]: for tln- rolli-gi: girl is [alien over
as part oi the lr‘irning procrss, it
Ilt‘COlllcs immensely useful. The
tryvunt system during vacations can
reduce the ‘hire and lirc‘ system
after graduation."

Ilnring ‘the past year, the lurcau
has helped 225 (imicher graduates
to improve IIIlL'Ir vocational choices
and has made 27 rcadiustnlcnts
among' teachers. It) among social
workers, eight among laboratory
technicians, and [our in the general
lirld of business. In supervising
the choices of vocations. thc
llnrcan works in close err-operation
with all (lepartmcnlls of the college,
getting a complete picture of the
students from the records of the
registrar. the academic dean, and
the department of physical cdiuca-
lion.
