Although the alumni of State
College are just hcginnhig to get the
ruaoliinery of their dormitoni fluid
in motion. approximately $3.000 has
been subscribed or pledged already.
The alumni plan to raise $300,
with which they will litiihl the very
best sort of modern dormitory for
State. The slogan of the drive is
"Give or (let $100," ' _

The general plan of organization
is to place a chairman in charge of
the work in each county of the state.
The chairman will direct the. work of
her captains who are local officers
within the county. There Wlll be_.1
captain for every lifteeu alumni in
the county. About eighty per cent.
of the county chairmen hare hcen
chosen and have 'ccepled. Many
report that they have already been
able to procure their captains. It
has been decided to write iudi\ idnally
to those alumni who are not taken
care of hy this system. The state—
wide drive has not been started yet,
but as the machinery is in order, re-
sults will not he loin.r iii conimg.

The issue of the Alumni Quarterly,
which will come out this week, is
devoted entirely to the dormitory
drive. it is illustrated, and it con-
taiiis letters endorsing the dormitory
project from Dr. liineguii, 'Dr. Finley,
and Dr, (ii-ares. Moreover, there
will appear numerous _testimonials
from people interested iii the vari-
otis phases of education on what otir
State College people do.

The organization and work of the
Alliain committee is especially inter-

SHIFTER EPIDEMIC IN
NEW YORK SCHOOLS

Flapper Movement New Country-
Wide

The badge is a paper clip, stuck
in the coat lapel. The vow is "lie
a good fellow; get something for
nothing," and the purpose of the mys-
terious iieiw secret society is to en»
rich the members through confes-
sed1_y petty graft. ’l‘he Shifters, or~
gainzatioii which ilias spread so rap.
ally in New York in recent weeks,
has found its way in a comparatively
shout time to practically every large
City in the eastern part of the
country. it has penetrated nearly
every hiin school in New York.
(hie principal said that every one of
his pupils was a iiieiiiher of ill. It
has spread to many of the colleges.
one of which is l‘riiiceton, where
shiftc‘ are as numerous as files in
siimniei The numbers there have
multiplied by leaps and bounds since
the lust meniher appeared a week
ago.

What purports to he heathpiai'ters
of the society of Shifters is at 303
Fifth Avenue, New York. Upstairs
the. society occupies rooms with
.1 "Jewelry" imiimfaeturiii‘g concern,
the. Shiftters' liiirlilem Company.
This firm produces a small enamel
pin, With which it hopes to rival
the paper clip commonly worn.

’l‘ie by-laws of the Society of
SllilflCl‘S,’ which Miss Robinson-Smith,
the president, made public last week
are as follows:

"The Shifters are an organization
of li‘rotherly and sistcrly love.

‘ o ‘llCCOlTIC a member:

“Make .tlie iiiiltiatc put his right
hand over his head and left hand
over his heart.

"He or she must promise to be a
good fellow or sister and to help
other Shifters at all times.

"As a fee the initiate pays anything
asked for by the person bringing
hnii into the order."

After meeting these requirements
the ritual continues: I

:‘Password—Jl have paid my check.’

'Hand shake~Placc the palms of
the hands together, but not closing
the hand. then put hand in the coat
and say: ‘Be a good fellow, get
something for nothing.’

‘:\s this is a secret order. all per-
sons miist promise not to divulge the
foregomg Signs, ctc., of the Shifters.

v

at of dangerous craze, it

i been condemned by high school

prinCipals on the ground that it in-

vites informalities, promotes cordial-

ity, and gives opportunity for indis-
criminate acquaintances.

teach next year and wants assistance
from the Appointment Bureau should
ﬁle credentials immediately and make
out an application.
