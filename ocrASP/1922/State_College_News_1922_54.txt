LET‘S HAVE MORE

,_._...

Say, folks, didn’t we have a iiicc
time in student assembly on l‘riday
the twenty-fourth? We didn't know
we had such a fine orchestra did'we?
In spilte of the fact that we missed
the pleasure of hearing the mens
quartet, we enjoyed all that did hap-
pen. The women’s ohorus 7mg well
and with spirit. And didn’t you an-
joy those negro ballads? My how we
saiigil That shows we have, some
pop When We aren't too—lets say
tired—to show it. The trouble With
us is that we think it's lots more
interesting to sit back in our seats
with a bored air and yawn, “My,
but student assemblies are stupid."
Student assemblies are just what the
students .make'them. It we’re bored,
they will he boreing. If we’re full
of enthusiasm and eager to enjoy
them, they are bound to interest us.
Why shouldn‘t-we sing more? I’m sure
that .the average student likes to
sing. Well, then, let’s_ learn our
songs. Suppose we begin With the
Alma Mater? Let's learn the words,
all of them, and let‘s learn them
correctly. A student body that can't
sing its own Alma Mater correctly
can’t be interested in putting .llS
college on the map. Just get out
that dust covered song book, sit
down for ten minutes, and learn your
Alma Mater. Learn ~wfhere “let the
freedom which cometh through
knowledge" comes, and don’t put it
in the wrong place.

Now we know it, Let’s sing. Let's
just make that auditorium ring next
Friday, The way we sing our songs
shows how much we love our col-
lege.- We canit be here long. Let's
work for her and love her and all
she stands for.

If you don’t like the songs we
sing,r'n’ake some new ones. They’re
always acceptable. Above all. let’s
.tryvto be interested and we soon
will he. We’ve enjoyedthis one as-
sembly and we can enjoy them all
it'lwe‘o‘nly will. Let’s try.

 

enosn AND sorns
ATTENTION

Where are those line red and
white caps that the fresh men Wore
last fall? it is loiir past the first
day of spring and stil they have not
made lheir appearance. it is a
college tradition that the caps should
be worn The cops are not unbe-
coming. in fact we think [they are
fine. Therefore we think the fresh

men should consider it a' pleasure:

and a duty to don their class colors
in the form of head gear.

Now as to the sophs. You sopli
fellows have a great black mar
against your spirit. You allowed the
fresh to walk off with your banner.
Why not rctalliare iby some drastic
enforcement of college traditions?
of course the college will stand back
of you in all you do to enforce trad-
itioiis. The park lake is rather con-

venient. A word to the Wise .is suf-
llctclll. Let‘s see the caps or SOmL‘
action.

 

To the Editor:

We are thoroughly tired of hearing
the modern girl denounced, are we
not? We, the modern college girls
have only disgust for those doleful
prophets of today who say that “our
national stamhirds of young woman-
hood ilrc being most speedily and
disastcrously lowered." They aren‘t,
we protest And we stand at atten-
tion, ready to defend ourselves and
our generation. ready to prove that
though we are young and by good
right impulsive, we are worth while,
and honorable, and fair minded, and
saiicly moral.

in the January copy of the
“Woman’s Home Companion" there
were two tinticlcs, one by Mary
Roberts Rinehart, denouncing the
modern college, business, and society
girl, and a rather uveakly defensive
article by Cora Harris. saying that
anyway if was :ill mother's fault, in
the February issue appeared an an-
swer by a college girl, speaking for
girls in general. She did not name
her college, but she said she was sure
fihe opinions of her college were those
of others, and :is i read it I was
proud to think that no one at State
College would belie her splendid de‘
tense, in any way.

Very well, than, we hereby estab-
lish ourselves, the girls of State Col-
lege, as a good, steady funloving,
but fairly studious group, and
think we shall lind plenty of support
for this bit of egotism among our
faculty. Of course we are young and
often thoughtless, but do we real~
izc that the good opinion we feel we
deserve by an act of sheer thought-
lcssncss? When a State College

.girl puts on her paper clip, and calls

herself an energetic Shifter, she
does it .in a spirit of adventure and
fun. She would resent the imputa«
tions she does not realize she is
bringing upon herself. But this
Shifter increment is more than the
clean joke we have here considered
it. Do we know what it means to
the public when the papers tell of
State College Shifters along with the
multitude of others. it means that
in the eyes of the outsider we are
nilying ourselves with the very worst
kind of modern girl, we are bringing
against us the charges we have hated
to bear against her, losing the strength
of the assertion we have so intensely
held to—that she is in the minority,
and not a representative of average
Americanyouiig woman. It may be
a joke among us, and it is, for we
are as wholeheartedly decent as we
have claimed, but young woman-
hood belongs to us to defend more
than many other class, so let us be
careful to ally ourselves with no
movement that will hurt our defense.

STATE COLLEGE NEWS, APRIL 3,1922 -

A FABLE BY AESOP, JR.

a time, in the land of
innitr a , a certain maiden made
ready or a great festival. And
there wore to be many young men
and maidens at [this festival, and they
planned to meet each other there.
And when the young maiden made
her plans. she took Cill't.‘ =lllfll she
should meet only yoimi.r men and
ma‘idens for whom she cared ex—
ceediugly.

Once upon

Now when one young maiden
spoke in her concerning the festival,
she looked on. her with scorn and
said unto herself "She is not of
us." Then to the maiden she re-
plied, “i shall he very busy at the
festival." And when another came
to her, she gave drought in the mat-

 

 

  

ter and considered that those with
,her would be strait e, and so the
answer was, “I shall i: very busy at
the festival." But there came to the
young maiden another maiden for
whom s'lichad affection, but she
dared not to make a promise to her
for the festival. for the Ol‘llcl‘ maid-
ens with her bad commanded that
she promise to them.

And in all of the festivals of this
tnziidcn's life, she made promises to
the same maidens. And when she
came to the judgment seat of the
gods, Zeus mnfle accusation of ex-
cliisrrciicss against her and decreed,
“Let her :ll\ iys be with lrhc maid-

ORGANIZA TIONS

Chemistry Club I ‘ I
The regular meeting of Chemistry
Club will be held Wednesday eve

ning, April 5, 1922. A paper on
nirrasircs will be presented by Miss
Euhel Meade.

At the last meeting, Friday after-
noon, March 24, Robert k‘lzicliarlaiic
outlined the life of Priestly. We
learned that lz’ricstly was a minister
by profession and did his chemical
work in his spare time. Indeed he
preached the gospel not only in Eng-
land, liut also in America.

Pricstly’s coiitribiuions to the
science of chemistry are well known,
but his iiiflucnce on the development
of chemistry in America has not been
fully mppreciated. The fircy upholder
of the philogiston theory interested
young Americans in chemistry and
stimulated them to further investi—
gate into the new science.

The Rev. Creighton, rector of St.
Andrew’s Church will be ill“! speaker
at Y, W. C. :\. on Tuesday. Marion
Miller is to be the leader.

The meeting will be held in Room

When friends called, “'24, Wake

Enemies now have shouted, "'24. Get
up." "is '24 awake?" Her friends
are ceasing to say, “She will awake.”
They are quoting the motto of “Life.”

CLARK STUDENTS, FIGHT
FOR ACADEMIC
FREEDOM

Worcester, Mass, March 24, 1922—
.-\t Clark University in this city there
is a. revolt of the student body which
suggests the wrathf‘nl days of 1775-6,
and the indignation of the colonists
against the crown.

On the evening of March 14 Dr.
Seoilt Nearing spoke under the
auspices of a student organization

 

known as the Clark Liberal Club,
his subject liclll”. “Control of Pub
lic Opinion." Dr. Harry E. Barnes,
Professor of History of Thought
and Culture, presided. The meeting
had been advertised throughout
\\'orcesicr, and an audience of 200
students, professors, and itownspcople
——cach having paid 25c to hear the
speaker—~crowdcd the assembly hall.

Dr. Neariiig's address had harm
in progress an hour and three-
quarters, when Dr. W. V, Atwood.
president of Clark, entered. the hall.
Within five minutes thereafter, he
rose, crossed over to Ross Fraser,
’22, president of the Liberal Club,
and orderch Mr. Fraser to “stop
him," to “lcll him to stop." Mr.
Fraser went to the platform and
spoke to .Dr. Nearing who iinmedi‘
atcly stopped his address, Mean-
while Dr. Atwood had stopped to
the platform. Facing the audience
he declared the meeting dismissed.
Amnzcment held the audience mov
tioiilcss. Dr. Atwood repeated in
an angry manner several times,
“This meeting is dismissed!" The
bulk of the audience still remaining
in the hall, Dr. Atwood ordered the
janitor to cxrtiuguis‘h the lights, and
intimated that the police might be
summoned.

:\s soon as they had recovered
sufﬁciently from their aimizement.
the students who had. arranged the
meeting, accompanied by Dr. ear-
ini.r and followed by part of the nudi—
ence, led the way out of the hall
to a nearby fanternity house, where
the lecturer finished his address.

Dr. Atwood’s sudideii action came
as a great shock to the students.
The meeting had been scheduled
since ‘Dcccnrher; Dr. Atwood had as-
signed -the hall in which it was
to he held and had granted the
privilege of charging admission; he
had made a disparaging remark con-
cerning the speaker at the time of a5<
signing the hall, which evidenced the
fact that he was acquainted with Dr.
Nearing's philosophy. Later, in ac—
counting for his action Dr. Atwood
said to the reporters, “‘I closed the
meeting because there were so many
of our undergraduatespresent. I
