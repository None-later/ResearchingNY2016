ManzMade Lightning

RANKLIN removed some of the mystery. But
only recently has science really explained the
electrical phenomena of the thunderstorm.

Dr. C. P. Steinmetz expounds this theory. Rain~

 

 

drops retain on their surfaces electrical charges,
given off by the sun and other incandescent bodies.
In falling, raindrops combine, but their surfaces do
not increase in proportion. Hence, the electrical
pressure grows rapidly, Finally it reaches the limit
the air can stand and the lightning ﬂash results.

And now we have artiﬁcial lightning. One million
volts of electricity—approximately one ﬁftieth of the
voltage in a lightning ﬂash—~have been sent success-
fully over a transmission line in the General Engineer-
ing Laboratory of the General Electric Company.
This is nearly ﬁve times the voltage ever before
placed on a transmission line.

Much valuable knowledge of high voltage phenom-
ena—essential for extending long distance trans-
mission—was acquired from these tests. Engineers
now see the potential power in remote mountain
streams serving in industries hundreds of miles away.

Man-made lightning was the result of ungrudging
and patient experimentation by the same engineers
who ﬁrst sent 15,000 volts over a long distance
thirty years ago.

“ Keeping everlastineg at it brings success.”
It is difﬁcult to forecast what the results of the next
thirty years may be.

naturally would feel a responsibility
for their hearing further statements
such as were being made by the
speaker."

Dr. Neuring‘s address was an at-
tempt to show that the dominant in-
terests in any society, in. order to
protect themselves, get control
of the opinion-creating forces,—
the press, the pulpit. and the schools.
The authorities referred to by him
were Bryce’s “American Common-
wealth" Part 5, and Veblen’s "Theory
of the Leisure Class." Clark stu—
dents are chuckling over the fact
that Thorsten Veblen is Dr. Atwood‘s
brother-in—law, and has been invited
by the latter to lecture at the uni-
versity.

In commenting on the affair from
the student point of view, ﬂoss
Fraser said “Students and faculty

 

alike resent the attitude of President
Atwood at the meeting last night.
Not-hing.r could better illustrate and
prove the argument of the lecturer.
We feel that Dr. Atwood has vio-
lath the essential spirit of Clark.
which has always been exempliﬁed
in freedom of speech."

Students Summon President

By Wednesday morning the ex-
cilcmen‘t of the meeting had spread
throughout the student body. and the
local newspapers were whetting the
interest of the public. At the in-
stigation of three of the students
—-not members of the Liberal Club
-—the president of the Student Body
called a meeting to discuss the affair.
The men who precipitated this action
were F. Lovell Bixliy, ’22,'president
of the Musical Clubs, Warren Hume.
president of the Senior class and

 

Amateur Boxing Champion of New
England, and Stewart M. Pratt, '22,
manager of the Baseball team. When
questioned as to the basis of their
procedure Pratt said, “President At-
wood's action appeared to us as 11
direct thrust at the intellectual free-1
dom which makes Clark a live place,
and at a tradition of which we are
all proud."

With the exception of than students,
who refrained from voting, the meet-
ing of the student body was in favor
of asking President Atwood to ad-
dress the students in explanation "of
the views of the administration re—
garding the freedom of thought and
its expression to be allowed in Clark
University under said administra-
tion.” The treatment of the ten stu-
dents, conspicuous by their neutral-
ity, may he cited as characteristic
of the spirit in which Clark stu-
