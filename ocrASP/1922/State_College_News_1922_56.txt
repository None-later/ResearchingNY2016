dents are handling their side of tlte
controversy Some of the over-
zealous :were for trying the ten dis-
senters us to their sympathies. It
sufficed for one person to rise tn the
meeting and to dcclare “if we are
fighting for the right of free speech
we must concede the right of free
silence." The ten \vere allowed to
leave the room ttnmol'ésted.

Regent Charge of Bolshevieni

The protest initiated at the Stu-
dent Body meeting on the 15th has
been steadily gaining in momentum.
The committee appointed by the
meeting scattered at once to the
stacks in the library and soon the
college bulletin boards were plastered
with quotations from Wendell Phil-
lips, Thomas Jefferson, Lincoln, etc,
supporting free speech. Someone
even dug out a clause in the will ‘olf
the founder. James G. Clark, stipu-
lating for intellectual freedom in the
university. “1'

The undergraduate students ha c
prepared the following statement in
answer to charges made chiefly in
the local press and from the pulpits
of some of the churches:

I. We do not advocate Social-
ism. I’mlshevism, Communism, or
Anarchism.

2. We do believe in the incon-
trovertible right and duty of ad-
ucators, educational institutions
and most cspccially institutions of
higher lcarniup: to teach, to dis-~
01155 and announce the truth in
whatever form it may appear,
wholly free from coercion by any
influence of special intcrcst or in-
sidious propaganda.

3. Most pertinent to the present
local situation. we believe that the
issue is not bound up with support
of socialistic or anarchistic doc-
trincs. To such doctrines we do
not subscribe.

We do believe that Clark Uni-
versity ceases to exist as an in-
stitution of higher learning when
it is deprived of those peculiarly
characteristic principles enunciated
by its benefactor and founder,
Jonas Gilman Clark, and carefully
nuturcd by its former President,
G. Stanley Hall. throughout its
previous existence.

5. These principles are that there
shall never be any abridgcmcnt of
the inalienable right of self-ex-
pression within the environs of
the University; that. in the words
of the founder which we believe
to be peculiarly relevant to the sit-
uation, "—its doors may he ever
open to all classes and persons
whatsoever may be their religious
faith or political sympathies, or
to whatever creed, sect, or party
they may belong}?

On the 16th the graduate students

Several members of the faculty have
made common cause with the stu—
dents in their stand for intellectual
liberty, and almost all 3 rec in de-

he most recent scene in the drama
was the appearance of President At-
wood beforc a Student Body meeting
.on_lldarch 20th. In substance his
position as stated in his speech was.
that while an open forum might
serve a useful purpose outside, he
doubted uts ,place in a university and
he put. himself on reeOrd for an
academtc freedom which should be
tempered by the judgment of the
authorities. I lie laid emphasis upon

are prepared to go elsewhere in the
future.

Dear friend who contributes:

There are those who like bobbed
