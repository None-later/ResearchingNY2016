LAST FROLIC OF SEASON

Sophomores Victors In 'Gyni Meet
The ttmst unforgetahh: (3 'III Frolic.

of the season imprinted it'sel upon our
memory last Saturday night, 'l‘here
ncver was such a t‘lttlt‘l<fllll-t)fvftltt time.
I o begin with, every fnteloving possess--
or of lllltltly and bloomers, having do \’
arrived at the gym in these llt t ' 4
and having parted with ten cents, pro-
ceeded to be as vociferonsas lungt'apac-
uy permitted in singing Alma Mater,

Following this demonstration the
business met-ting was Itch. (l. 1 . A.
voted to pledge lift y dollars a year for
two yc- s to the Dormitory Fund
to gm ls much more as tltc ll llry
could part with. Th officers for the
next year were nominated:

For l'l'('Si(lt'tll': Marion Miller, May
Wood, Wilhelmina lleint-man, limilv
lleltling. '

For \"icevl’t‘csident : — lletty liachw
Martha llailey, lithel Seymour, (iladvs
Lodge, l‘lildegnrth' l.iebit‘b. It v

“or Secretary: Annie ()lson, l\lurga~
rr-t (‘u. iinan, Dorothy Dangt-rniond,
Florence (‘raddoclc » '

For Treasurer: Muriel Daggt-tt, live»-
lyn \\'ang|c, Margaret l'lulchins, Mary
\\’right‘.

For (‘Iieer Leader: Annie Olson, Dor‘
othea Deitz. Marjorie lllythe.

The stunts whirh came after this were
so funny that they made even the most
digniﬁed chaperones smile. Shades of
Shifters, but those stunts were funny!
They were in name and form about like
the events of an interclass track meet,
but —. imagine four human t‘l. tipedes
racing along the floor! The six-legged
animal, '22, was first in this event. '23
triumphed in the “shot put." Much
praise is due the victor because of ex-
treme effort exerted in throwing the
blown up paper bag the record-break-
ing ten feet. ' ‘ 0 third event was more
than thrilling! lletter than Saratoga
was it to see lleet 'Z-l dash off on her
two squares of paper, l'lum i—plump!
she advanced, stepping on car 1 sheet of
paper as she picked it up and shoved it
ahead. Never before was there such a
distance between the winner and the
“also-runs."

{eso d and proved :-—that '24 is
the jolliest, best—natured class in college
because, in the event known as the
f'stanrling broad grin." '24 outgl'innetl
every other Class on the floor.

The versatile '24 again triumphed in
the back-to-baek race but was out-
thrown in the. discus (paper plate)
throwing. The concluding event of the
meet was a shoe race, won by '23. Need-
less to say, ’24 won the. meet!

Eats followed and ginger snaps rolled
plentifully from a huge bag into the
many outstretched and eager hands.
Sweet, orange-colored sticks vanished
mysteriously. Someone played, every-
one danced, thc elortk struck ten thirty
aml ever 'one Went home laughing and
vowing that; she had had the best time,
'n’-a-lnt-niore.
