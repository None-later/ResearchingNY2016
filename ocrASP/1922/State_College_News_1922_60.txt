ELECTIONS ONCE MORE

(‘ollege and class elections will take
place a week front this next. Friday.
During: the next two weeks, it is the
duty of everyone to be considering for
whom he will vote, Very often we do
for this to the last day and decide on
the spur of Ihe moment. 'l‘hese out-s-
lions are of vital importance to our (fol-
lege and to the dilTereut classes and are
therefore worthy of our most serious
thought.

In making these decisions we too
often allow ourselves to be iullueueed
entirely by our own personal feelings
and prejudices, or else we take some-
one else's word for whom is the best
person for an office and do not deter-
mine the question for ourselves. The
nominees for all offices are published in
this issue of the [V17 .. Let us lool:
over the names carefully and form an
unbiased Opinion concerning wl ' 'l
son will ﬁll each ollice most sue

We should considered who i,
of performing the duties of Ihe office
most efficiently, and also whether he
will he illllL' toearry people with hint in
what he undertakes, that is, his ability
to lead others. Has he the character
and the personality which we want a
representative of St ate College to have?
Is he worthy of the office?

If we elect our ofﬁcers upon these
principlen we will feel that we can give
them our best support when they enter
upon their duties in the fall, and we
will he ready to stand back of them in
all their work for the good of State
College.
