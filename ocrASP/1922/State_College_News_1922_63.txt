STRAND THEATRE PARTY

Have you heard about it? The Strand
Theater Party? The conditions are
these: if we sell $2000 worth of tickets
we shall get 50 percent of the proceeds.
If every student sells ﬁve. tickets we can
go over the top with flying colors.

The best part of the afiair is that there
are to he two different programs during
the wet] ~hoth of which will be well
worth st mg. If you can’t sell your
quota of five, you can at least sell three,
and without doubt will want to tise the
other two for yourself.

During the war every town knew and
expected that a quota would he as-
signed to it. When they learned what
that quota was, no things were left Un-
done to make that stated amount. it
was considered almost a disgrace and
a town could hardly recover from the
shame that resulted if they were unable
to do their share. This is the spirit that
we State College people should exhibit
in this part of the Dormitory Drive.
It is one of the easiest tasks we will ever
have, for are not the people of America
great theater-goers, and do we not live
among perfectly normal and average
Americans?

Let's say we'll go over the top or hide
our heads in shame, and then doit.
This isn't a world war, but it‘s a war
against improper living conditions.
They are our enemies!

 

 

TO ’24
'24, we thank you. You’ve done just
what we hoped you'd do. But when
we listen to the ground, we hope to see
a spring-like leaf shoot up. '22

A ram—sir AESOP, 111.

Once upon a time, in the land of long
ago, there lived a man who smiled at
other men. But this man’s smiles were
not pleasant for his 'oy came with find-
ing the foolishness in other niena-and
he smiled even at himself, for he was
foolish, too. And .he sat by the high-
way and smiled at the race of man for
four seasons of snow and four seasons
of spring; and in all that time it was
found by him that there was a bit of

foolishness in every man that marched
down the long highway, and his. smile
came as he said, “How surely they
stop." And lo—-,ns they came nearer,
his smile changed. and his eyes grew
eager. " low far their steps carry them
forward" he said. Then he spoke to the
great god of Olympus, "(lrant them al-
wa a sure step even after they have
smiled at their foolishness.” Then the
man came} to the multitude and
marched ouuwith them. And as he
gazed hack iiL his seat by the highway,
a little of the old smile was upon him
as he said, “The world's our oyster.’
