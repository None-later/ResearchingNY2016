Take it From The Air

OT only music, but news, speeches, messages
of every sort, are today being picked out of
the air.

“How has this come about?” we ask.

The new impetus given to radio development may
be deﬁnitely associated with the development of the
high power vacuum tube, for that made broadcasting
possible. And the power tube originated from a
piece of purely theoretical research, which had no
connection with radio.

When a scientist in the Research Laboratories of
the General Electric Company found that electric
current could be made to pass through the highest
possible vacuum and could be varied according to
ﬁxed laws, he established the principle of the power
tube and laid the foundation for the “tron” group of
devices.

These devices magnify the tiny telephone currents
produced by the voice and supply them to the
antenna, which broadcasts the messages. At the
receiving end, smaller “trons”, in turn, magnify the
otherwise imperceptible messages coming to them
from the receiving antenna.

Great accomplishments are not picked out of the
air. Generally, as in this case, they grow from one
man’s insatiable desire to ﬁnd out the “how” of
things.

Scientiﬁc research discovers the facts. Practical
applications follow in good time.
