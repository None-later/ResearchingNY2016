CAMPUS DAY

('amptts Day at. ate College this
y -ar ‘oiueitled with Armistice Day
' hi tn . third year that we have ob—
served this day and it' i now t‘ousitlered
a college tradition. Its aim is to arouse
early ill the year a college spirit and
class spirit that shall last and grow
stronger ttutil June.

:\u atldrtr‘s by Dr. Moltlenhttwer in
Student. mth and athletic contests
during the afternoon were the chief
events of Campus Day this year. Class
stttnls were also given in the morning.

Th' is the. ﬁrst real opportunity the
new freshmen have to show the college
what they can do. If 192!» is as suc—
ful as 1025 was, they will be happy
frole

Among the athletic -vents \vere inter-
‘ s in ' thall and football games,
obstacle rae s and a tttg-u'avar.

We hope that (‘ampus Day will con-
titttte to serve its purpose as well in the
future as it has in the past.
