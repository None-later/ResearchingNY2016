UNWRITTEN LAW

 

 

[Jo you l't‘lllCllll)t'l". you upper-
classmi-n atid sophomores. that the
State College student body iiiiaiii-
Inously voted to dispi-nsc with
studying, knitting. writing; and so
on in chapel? It you don‘t recall
it. perhaps it would he \\'t’ll to rc-
ininil you! Also the frcshmcn
should bc llllt‘lt‘sll‘tl in knowing,I
just ulial liappi'ni'tl at that time.
'l‘lic followint;' is a clipping( from
a “.\'i-\vs" of January l3. 1‘)le

“Another snbjcct which was
bro em up in assembly w:' that
a great many students study. write,
or knit during chapel. Marjoric
l'otlcr suggested that the student
body should i ' a resolution
'rainst this practise. This sug—
t. tioii was followed and ltcreaftCt
all work of every kind will be lefi
outside."

()n the following to of faint-
ary 20, 1921. an l‘tllltlll . of which
this is a part. It|)]it'.'tl‘t'lli

“How good it itft’llilftl to have
everyone vote in favor of the
motion that was brought up in
assembly two wccks ago—namely.
that no one should bring; books.
llllltflt‘ﬂ. clt'.. to chapel. lint how
much itcllt‘l‘ it see ii to have this
vision realized o one forgot. but
everyone came cmpty handed, with
nothing to do but give his best at-
tention to what was coin;r on."

Do you think that anyone could
truthfully \\’rllt’ such an editorial
at the present time? Perhaps the
motion wasn't stated in so many
words, but even if it wasn‘t, it’s
supposed to be an unwritten law
that this custom is lasting; and not
one. that has to be voted upon an-
mially, ave you been doing
YOUR best to make this a perman-
ent thing?

WAKE UP ’24

What a hunch of students we
have become We admit it's a good
thing—with prospects of the com-
ing two weeks before us. But when
those two weeks are over, let's get
back to being a regular college.
besides being students. Every reg-
ular college has a freshman class

 

at least half subdued before this

 

of their biisinc. . 'l‘licn' sister class
helicch '24 can do its ditty well if
it will take the energy. We most
certainly do not desire ihuir»pn|ling
mobs, but we do hope to s col-
lege traditions kept and
rules obeyed. And where is the
courtesy due the seniors troni lllC
freshmen? it is impossible now
for a senior to plow thronin the
ma s of freshmen who stand in the
way of lockers. And arc the fresh—
mcu obeying rules? Watch their
violations. Of course they should
be ashamed of not keeping Slate's
traditions, hilt they must be taught
what a Shame it is.

The sophomores are the ack-
nowlcdircil prcsci‘vcrs of college
tradition and sliiuan rtilcs. and
this fact has alt tys been lived up
to by othcr clas. s. Wake up, " ;
your sister. '22, calls you. .\lakc

EXAMS AND EDUCATION

Do you know the uirl tor boyl
who rushes around a wi-ck l)t‘ftil'(’
exams, or even a din before, rat»
tlint.r off phrascs of information as
fast as she can talk. and waging;
every other person she in .ts to
tell her something about this or
that subject? 'l‘lii-ri: art: iiuitr a
number of them around State Col
iv: —;ittst watch out for them this
w ! Do you ever wonder hon
ttltlt‘ll tlicy really do know? Any-
ittii’ would think that to them the
chit-f aim and object of education
was to cram as much as po iblc
into one set of brains in order to
supply material for an examination.
If anything is lt-ariicd that is not
asked for, it is accoiintiai as a

 

 

  
 

product of wasch i-ncr What
an awful attitude tlii. s to take
toward education and exami-

nations! Everything we lcaru is a

   

 

ha tor our future idc: ind pro-
or Rs in lite: we can never know
too much. If we lt‘Ill‘lltItl the re‘

uiiired lessons suggested by our iu~
structors. thch would be no iieiiil

‘ c to rush wildly about at
the last motncnt attemptingr to get
enough knowledge to pass an exam.
Have you ever noticed that the
people who have this habit are those
whose favorite motto seems to be
"Ignorance is bliss"?
