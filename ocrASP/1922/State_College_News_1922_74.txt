and Catherine, played by Marjorie Sib-
lev and Florence Allen respectively.
All those who saw Margaret O'Douue l,
as Kami, will especially appreciate her
as a member of the servant stall". Ed-
ward Vines excellently interprets the
role of Lord Loam who has a seat in the
upper house of Parliament. Randolph
Linderuuln, as the funny English no-
bleman, lirnest, and Edmond Crane as
an English clergyman are very appeal-
ing. And then Lady Brocklehurst and
her son, Lord lirocklehurst, played by
Mildred Stetson and Thomas Bentley,
will satisfy our desires to see the nobil-
ity. Besides all these attractions are
introduced the servants of' the English
home—a rare treat indeed.

SPECTACULAR WORK FOR DORM

 

Following Miss Murray's suggestion,
the ﬁrst spectacular stunts for the dorm
fund were done on the Y. W. Cabinet
camping trip at Kinderhook from May
5 to 8. The girls shampooed each oth-
er's hair for the sum of 25 cents which
was contributed for the dorm. They
also laced each other's high hiking shoes
for 5 cents each.

The Gamma Kappa Phi sorority girls
sold homemade candy in the lower hall
(luring noon hour on last Thursday. At
12 :45 they reported the candy gone and
a proﬁt of $10.26.

 

 

PROSPECTS FOR A LARGE

as was the total number for the class of
l925 on September let. the same
rate of inquiry continues, the class of
1926 will be selected from a grand wt

In past years a little more than one-
half of those who have inquiried, and
have presented partial entrance cre-
dentials, have ﬁnally qualiﬁed for tltl-
mission. At this rate, more than 600
will qualify for the class of 1926. Un-
fortunately, the facilities of the Col-
lege will make it impossible to admit
more than 275 freshmen. This will
mean a selective process will have to be
carried on by the College. it would
seem advisable for those who wish to
enter next September to present their
credentials early.

FRENCH CLUB TEA

The French Club gave an informal
tea on Saturday afternoon from 3 to 5
to the members of the faculty and to
their friends. Miss Elise Rigouard re-
ceived the guests and Miss Leah and
Miss Martinez poureed. The Rotunda
was attractively decorated with flour-
