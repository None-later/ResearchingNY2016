PASSING IT ON

As the old "News" board gives over
its work to the newly l!l(.'t'l('tl people for
the year 1922-23, the nnnnbers feel that
they would like to take. this opportun-
ity to thank the student bme for the
help that they have given in the publi-
catlon of the paper. At the same time
they hope that the mistakes will he
kindly overlooked, but that the im-
provements will not be, but will be
marked down to the credit of 1922.

The new hoard is not going into the
work alone, for while the l‘)22 people
are here they will be only too glad to
give any possible assistance, and when
they leave, they will leave their very
best wishes behind.

1921-22 ask that State be as kind to
1922-23 as they have been to the board
this year.

GET IN THE SUN

Do you honestly think that State is
getting the publicity that it deserves?
Of course you don't. It is the only real
live college in Albany, bllt it is very scl-
dom that the public press honors it with
more than a couple of paragraphs. Our
athletic teams are lucky if they get even
a brief mention after a big victory.

Wat is the matter? The answer
doesn't fit in very good with our pride.
The most optimistic of us has to admit
that people outside of our owm circle
of friends know nothing of our Alma
Mater and the work she is doing. If
you were to go to the corner of Central
Avenue and Robin Street and should
ask anyone what the buildings at the
end of Robin Street are, you know what
kind of an answer you would get. No
one would tell you it was the State Col-
lege for ’ 'eachers.

After this statement of the case let us
find a remedy. This is not; far to seek
for there can be only one cure. That is
individual boosting, publicity, propa-
ganda, or any other name you may
choose to call it. '

On Friday you will have a good
chance to start things moving outside
college as well as inside. In the after-

 

noon there is going to be a parade to
Rid aﬁeld for the track meet. Plan to
be t rare with the rest. A colorful pro-
cession like this sure would attract at-
tention. Folks couldn't help taking
notice. They would sit up and realize
that: State College is more than a mill
for grinding out school teachers. It
might: make them curious enough to
find out the correct name of the insti-
tution. They might. he interested
enough to help our dormitory fund.
Anyway it is worth trying. We have
stayed long enough in the shade. Now
is the time to come out into the sun-
light and show folks a real college full
of lively, snappy, giugery, wide-awake
students.

DANCE FOR DORM

 

One of the features of the campaign
for dormitories, in addition to the
Strand parties held all the past week,
was last Friday's dance and card party.

"his event was patronized by many
State College Alumnae and students
who are hopefully looking forward to
the success of our plans.

, There was dancing in the gymnasium
at the same Lillie that the card party
took place on the ﬁrst 001'. There
was a prize for each table. Refresh-
ments were sold in the cafeteria.

The committee in charge of this fea-
ture of our campaign was: Mrs. G. ‘.
Long, chairman; Mrs. C. Woodward,
Miss Minnie Scotland, Miss Ma Sil-
lingham, Mrs. Soxlmry, Miss Ida Isdell,
Margaret Cushman, and Grace Fox.

A SUMMER VACATION IN MIAMI AND SOUTHERN FLORIDA

by Mirr Eunice I’Niue

What. are you going to do for a Stun-
Iuer Vacation? Have you thought of

partigy, that. is because you don’t know
what a good time you would have, and
you doubtless think that it. is much hot-
ter than it really is.

lint. Florida is wonderful in the sum-
mer and quite as interesting as it is in
the winter, although not quite an mme
of the big hotels are t)|)t'll. I know an
enlerprising college r'hap who decided
that it Would add In his education to
see some of the southern t‘ilics. So he
set out. with a dollar or so and a willing
pair of hands and found a lot of exper—
ience, a “right good time” and numer—
ous nutmnobile "lills" on his way from
one later ting city to the next. lie

country, turning “house painter” or
“jitue ' driver" an opportunity offers,
to replenish funds a bit, and then on lo
the next point of historical interest,
All this is making him in delightful rom-
panion, for trawling wit it out-'9 eyesand
mind wide open, is fun for the fellow,
and food for the forming of friends, (-s-
pui'ially in the sunny south.

 

 

meats become more numerous. All
along, the bird life is unique, alwa s
the turkey ht rds and the night
hawks, the lwnutiful blue herons and
the may pink famingues. Once a curi-
ous annual the size of a big calf with
antlers much too large for it prnncnd
away into the underln'ush at the noise
of our train, saw il first and could
keep silenre no longer, and said to the
man behind me, "Is that a deer?" He

We were about l0 miles from Miami
when we stopped at a little town and
the conductor startled nu» by annouqu

for I looked out to see my own name

that the town w. x named for lh‘. llt-nry

want to tell you of that glorious ocean
trip down the coast on the steamer from
New York with never a stop until we
arrived at Key West at 5 p. m. on last
July 3rd. After we missed Cape Hat-
teras, there was no doubt about being
in "southern waters," and from there
on the cloud effects were wonderful!
Great fleeey, billowy banks, floating
against the hluest sky I have ever seen
this side of the h/lediterranean Sea
along the coast of Italy, with sunrises
and sunsets of dazzling brilliancy, mak-
ing such wonderful paths of gold and
topaz and sapphire along the glistening
ocean, that you long to walk right up
the shining streets into the city not
made with handsl—Tbis was typical
of Florida mornings and evenings all
summer long. Just imagine all this
brilliancy seen from the shore of Miami,
against a long avenue of royal palms,
silhouetted in stately grandeur and
tossing their feathery plumes against
the gleaming background of sky and

But ﬁnally the 3rd of July came and
our boat pulled in at Key Vest aml
stopped. I speak of it with feeling, for
then the mosquitoes began. But they
were among the few drawbacks-and
were left behind at Key West when the
train pulled out; for the lSO—mile trip
over that wonderful Flagler railroad,
up the coast to Miami. For a hundred
miles, this road i. st one long bridge
after another over which your train
proceeds from Key to Key, pausing at
the more important villages, until the
marshlands are reached and settle-

the native tribes, cultivating and in-
troducing useful plants from Mexico,

ing to quell their fury, His family cs-

leading from their home to a boat land-
ing; but further history I could not
tind, except that we have a common
ancestor in “Peter, the Huguenot,"
eight Centuries ago, as recorded in the
family history.

Miami is becoming the big city of
Southern Florida, It is only 23 years
old and even in the summer season, the
streets are so congested with automo-
biles that one wonde what they do
with the many tourists who come in
December.

The opportunities for sea bathing,
with its big “Casinos” and many huge
swimming pools, make it as ideal in
summer as in winter for healthful
sports.

But the best of all was the trip into
the Upper Everglades. Usually this
can be done in a 00-foot steamer and it;
is a beautiful ride up the Miami Canal
to Lake Okeechobee into the very heart
of Southern Florida, but we chose to go
by automobile to Palm Beach, a mar-
velous drive of over forty miles along
the seashore. Then striking into the
interior we covered the 190 miles from
Miami in It) hours. The last: 50 miles
