WITH APOLOGIES
T0 MR. KIPLING

When State's last election is voted,

And the ballots are twisted and torn,

When the lawsof elections are quoted,

And electioneers’ voices are worn,

We shall rest ,——and, faith, we shall
need it,

C avort for a moment or two,

Till the tests of the faculty’s making

Shall set us to work anew.

And those who have won shall be happy;

They shall ﬁnd their whole world fair,

They shall dream of the honors of ofﬁce,

Forgetting its troublesome care.

We shall how no friends to (lodge from,
file ions or votes to debate,

We can bask in our diln obscurity
And never be dragged out by late.

 

And no one shall work for his lessons,

And only our teachers shall drive,

And no one shall cram in the springtime,

And only the hluffers survive.

But each shall foresee exam time,

And each, at that sad hour's eall,

Shall pass the course as he's crammed it,

And the best liluffer shall pass their? it‘lll.
. A’ .
