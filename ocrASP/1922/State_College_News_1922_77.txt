GENERAL ELECTRIC ANNOUNCES
NEW RADIO BROADCASTING
STATION WGY

A radio broadcasting station, more
powerful than any now sending out
programs, has been installed by the
General Electric Company at its plant
in Schenectady, N. .

From the roof of a five-story factory
building, two towers 183 feet high and
spaced 350 feet apart, support an an-
tenna at suchhei ht as to give the wire-
less waves unobstructed freedom to
travel equally well at a speed of 186,000
feet per second in all directions.

This station has not been regularly
operated nor has advance announce-
ment been made of the im romptu or
test programs sent out, w ich would
cause amateurs to be listening, yet, let-
ters have been received from soch (lis-
tant points as Cedar Ra ids, Iowa,
Minneapolis and Santa Cara, Cuba,
the latter place 1450 miles distance,
announcing that the programs have
been heard. These reports Come from
operators who, in an evening's ex eri-
menting with their receiving sets, iave
accidentall come upon the waves from
Schenectady and are not indication of
the distance this station may be heard.

Broadcasting stations, with but a
fraction of the power of the (id? sta-
tion, have III'CII heard at distances of
2,000 miles or more under favorable
atmospheric conditions.

The General Electric station has
been licensed to operate on a Mil-meter
wave length under the call letters of
\V. (i. Y. It is equipped with the most
modern of radio apparatus, including
the multiple timed antenna which, be-
cause of its many advantages, has been
installed in Radio Central, the world’s
most powerful station at Rocky Point,
L. I., and other transoceanic stations
of the Radio Corporation of America.

three~room studio, where the pro-
grams are produced, is located in a
Company oﬂice building, 3000 feet from
the transmitting station. One room is
used as a reception room for the artists,
where they may sit and chat until their
time on the program arrives without
danger or interfering with what is go-
ing on in the studio. The second room
is the studio, where a concert grand
piano, vietrola, an organ and other
equipment for the artists are to be
found. Here a number of portable
microphones, which are commonly
known as pick-up devices, can be shift-
ed about to locations best suited for the
reception of announcements, musical
numbers, or whatever may be sent out.
In the room on the o posite side of the
studio is apparatus or amplifying the
sound waves before they are transmit-
ted by wires to the broadcasting station.

A switchboard in the studio, which
lights a red light when the station is in
operation thus warning persons in the
room that whatever they might say
will be sent out to thousands of cars of
an invisible audience, is within reach
of the studio director at all times. Not
until he throws a switch can anything
reach the antenna. A telephone at-
tached keeps him constantly informed
just how the program is going out and
allows him to change position of the ar-
tists or microphone if such is necessary
to improve the tone quality of the
entertainment.

With the exception of the small pick-
up devices or microphones and the
switchboard, there is nothing in this
room to indicate it as different from any
musical studio.

In the apparatus room, the sound
waves are put through a number of
steps of ampliﬁcation by means of vac-
uum tubcs which increases their volume
thbusands of times. The amplified
sounds are then put into a wire and sent
to the broadcasting station, where they
enter another bank of vacuum tubes,
known as modulators or molders of the
electric waves.

 

 

 

Direct current at a high voltage is
necessary for the operation of a trans-
mitting station. To obtain this, a 220-
volt a ternating current line, which is
but little longer than the voltage used
for lighting purposes in the home, is
boosted to 30,000 volts by means of a
transformer. This voltage is then ap-
plied to a number of vacuum tubes,
acting as rectiﬁers, which change the
voltage to direct current. Placed be-
tween the rectiﬁer and the modulator
or molding tubes, is a high power oscil-
lator tube. The electric power enter-
ing this tube sets the other into vibra-
tion and upon these vibrations the elec-
tric waves, molded into shape in the
modulator tubes, are sent to the an-
tenna to go out into space.

A SUMMER VACATION
(Continued from 1mm- 2i
going, but we were in time for 6 o'clock
t inner.

This "ICverglade" of Florida is fast
becoming a fairy land instead of a
“dismal swamp." On [he “hammock
lands,” which are like islands a little
higher than the surrounding parts, the
vegetation is a mass of tropical trees
and vines, and banging moss.

One cypress tree that we saw has a
diameter of 22 feet, and upon the
cleared laml the growth is like a verit-
able “laek's beanstalk," with sunflow-
ers 2 feet across the disks and corn and
sugar cane 12 to Is feel; high. The
sweet-scented moon-vine clambers over
the custard apple trees until the leaves
are mosaiced so closely together they
look like mountains of foliage stretch-
ing away and forming wicril hack-
grounds, as if a great stage had been
hung with curtains of tropical scenery.

' hese are some of the ways in which
a summer vacation in Florida could
widen your knowledge and enthusiasm
for this glorious country of ours.

They tell the story in the South that
Miami was named for the clever young
Seminole squaw to whom an early
white traveler once said: "How beati-
tiful you are!"

Sheareth replied: “My! am I?”

And you sure will agree with that
traveler when you come to know M i—
ami, the lovely namesake of this mythi«
cal Indian maiden.

tion, secretary; Dean Harlan H. “or-
ner; George M. York, . B., professor

The purpose of this committee is the
adjustment of State College graduates

also to bring to the attention of school
boards and others employing teachers,

present than ever before for profession—
ally trained teachers and the Appoint-
ment Committee is ready to serve by
recommending adequater prepared
teachers.
