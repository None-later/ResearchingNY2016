Silver Bay spirit is growing every
day. Did you see the pageant last:
Wednesday? If you dirl, you learned
a lot of the difl'crcnt reasons why girls
go to Silver Bay, and perhaps you
caught a glimpst or so of the best that
is to be found there.

Helen Walker, as the Spirit of Silver
Bay, welcomed the girls who had come
to the conference for Social (iood Times,
Athletics, Dramatics, Music, lnrlivid<
ual li’roblerns, ant .sociatiou l’rob-
lenis. She showed the part that each
ol these phases of Silver Bay has in the
general program.

nth Heminover, as the Spirit of
Self Lost in Others, led a torchlight pro-
cr:ssion out of the auditorium and acrr 
the campus to the cafeteria. There a
strawberry short cake slipper was
served, followed by several jolly cheers
and songs and some very informal
speeches by membch of the delegations
of other years.

T is year's conference is to take place
from June 23 to July 3. There will be
a chance soon to Sign up on the Y. W.
bulletin board.

COLLEGE APPEAL T0 COMMUN-
- ITY SPIRIT

 

The plan to utilize the old Second
Presbyterian Church in Chapel Street
for a moving picture theater has aroused
protest not only from the historic and
art lovers all over the state, but also
from the most representative institu-
tion of the state, State College. Col-
lege sentiment is entirely against such
a

 

ctinn.

The students of State College are at-
t'ractcd, not only to the College, but to
the city of Albany, of which one of the
chief attractions is its historic places of
interest. it is the capitol of New York
State. It is old. lt is educationally
desirable. in every traveler's guide-
book, on cvcr‘y city post card, in historic
novels, Albany is pictured a treasure of
historic places. Albany boasts of its
Schuyler Mansion, its relics of the days
which gave us independence. Albany
is an aristocratic, reserved stronghold;
proud of its treasures. That "what the
traveler's guidebooks say—«but what.
has happened

llas Albany lost interest in all that
is beautiful? Do art, reputation, and
history mean nothing to the city? ()r
dons a movie Ihcatcr, of which we have
plenty to . s y lllt‘ needs ol‘ the most
ardent fans, mean more than u Illtmll—
mr-nt of famous :u‘rhitr-clurc, of which
any community would ln' justly proud?

State (‘ollogc students do not all
come from Albany. They represent
New York State. Thcy coluc from
rlnccs where even an historic cannon is
old in high r gard. They know what
it is to appr to art and bcatlty in its
most perfect forms. Those who have
nearly completed their course at col-
lege appreciate the old church, not only
or its historic value, but also lul‘ the
geniu. and renown of Philip llnoker,
the celebrated Albany architect. They
also appreciate it for the principle in-
volved in the desperate struggle being
made for it. fcty by those few who
appreciate it, not only from a personal,
but from a State Cnllcgc viewpoint.
grate (‘ollcgc rcpre -nt.~: New York
State. The students will be the future
teachers of the State's childrcn. They
rcprcscnl the class which will inllucucc
public opinion in the very near future.
They art.- the out-s who will or will not
pr: bany in her action towards this
relic of so great value. Must they say
of Albany that her p. sion for one more
movie theater ovcrrulcd her (lcSirc to
retain one of the ﬁttest rc with which
a city was ever endowed?

lf Albany is r't-ally desirous of keep-
ing State College the kind of a college
its rcpr sentation creates, it must not
lrrSc its standard of good judgment in
the eyes of State's present and future
students.
