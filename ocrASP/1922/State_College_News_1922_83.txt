OUR PRESIDENT
THE SUMMER SESSION OF
1922

There is an eagerness and an
evidence of industry in Summer
‘ on students that is too often
laeong in rollege students of the
regular term. He who gives his
slimmer to research and study
rather than to idle recreation is
|n'ofessiona|ly alert and forward~
looking. In teachers these are vir—
tues that used to he rare. but are
now herolning quite common. it
lit-speaks great things for the
schools of our cottnlry. and pront-
i *s gratifying growth in our pro-
f ..ional statute '\ hundred thon~
sand teachers en red in profes~
sional study duringr the middle of
the summer is an inspiration.
Where will you lind similar devo-
tion to ideals? Not in the ancient
aml honorahle profession of law,
medicine amt llivinity. Not in the
new claimants for recognition as
profe. ionserengineering,
architecture, journalism. [I'he sum-
mer sehools of teaehers and for
teachers are unique.

OUR DIRECTOR'S GREETING

An editorial writer in the New
York Times of Sunday, July 2, in

most of us they are not periods of
dornmney. ’l‘he lare'e tlttmhet‘s of
teachers attending this and other
summer sehools prove the truth
of this assertion. The school vaca
tion should return the tearher to
his work physically and mentally
ref shed. This cannot he done if
either mind or hotly is neglected.
l’rohahly a majority of the teaeh-
ers in attendance at summer
schools take too many hours of
work in the s-room.

that those who do one or two
courses in such a way that they
