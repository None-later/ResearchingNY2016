GOOD TIMES PLANNED

____.

Don't think for a minute that be—
cause you come to summer school
you have to work all the time. The

vacation along with your mental
recreation.

to be some lively tennis tourna-

lirom time to time groups of stu-
dents. who desire to make the must
of the' opportunities, also organ-
ize trips by blIS- Last summer
there was a very enjoyable trip
through the lcrkshires along the
Mohawk Trail. The good roads
from Albany to pleasure and sum-
mering resorts make long trips
pleasurable occasions instead of
tiresome ordeals.

Then. to tinish the season with a
bang, there is the Kingston l’nint
e.\‘cursion. You all have probably
heard of this event. The all-day
trip on the Day Line certainly
can’t be heat. It is something you
will always remember.

ALBANY. THE HISTORIC

How much do we know about
this old Dutch city of Albany and
the historic places just outside it?
There are the Education Building,
the Capitol, the Historical and Art
Society Building and the Schuyler
Mansion. which people are anxious
to know about. even if they are in
Albany but a short time.

The Education building is first
of all a piece of beautiful architec'
ture. lts mussivenes‘ impresses

 

 

the visitor. There are quiet read—
ing rooms and libraries, where tve
frequently go for reference work.
The museum is very interesting.
not only to the student of science.
but to everyone in general. There
one can see how pottery is finished
from its crude form, the varieties of
coal, geological fossils, precious
stones, birds and animals. Any-
body can spend several (lays at thls
museum and never feel as if he
knew all he, wished to know about
it. Don't forget the lndian groups,
which are works of art. Recently
there has been erected a life-size
mastorlon, the only (me in exist-
ence. (in and see what it is like.

Visit the Historical and Art
Society. lts art gallery and the
collections of china maintain (Inc's-t
interest for endless lengtlhs of
time. You must actually pull your-
self away from the place.

In the Capitol a few interesting
features are the rooms of the Sen-
ate and Assembly. the famous
staircase, and the portraits of New
York State governors.

liesidcs the Schuyler Mansion,
other historic places about Albany
are the Yankee Doodle House and
the Van Rensselaer Building. in
Iteusselaer. and lthc Saratoga Rat-
tletield. at Saratoga. There prob-
ably will he organized trips to
thes . If there are not, be sure to
go, anvway,
