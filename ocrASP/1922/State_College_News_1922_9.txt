AMERICA vs. PHILIPPINES
('otttittued Irmn pilH‘U I
cer. lit the United States the in-
terest itt the eatne is more intense.
It scents to be an Ain't-riean eh: tc-
teristic to forget everything else in
tile absorbing excitement (If the
lit addition to this the
an college girl seems to
more enthusiatn at alt ath-
letic event than do their sisters in
the Philippines. In tlte latter place
no girl without American training
would think of rheeritn‘r at a game.

 

 
 
 

.\II'. Saniel tinds the American
college professor totally dille tut
from the old fashioned native pro-
lessor of his own islands. ()nr
faculty are friendly and always
ready to help in all social ittnctin s
and athletic contests. 'l'hey main-
tain a vtry cordial relationship with
tlte student body, .-\ Filipino pro-
fessor would not think oi doing
such things. To hint it would be
heneath his dignity to mingle with
tlte students in any way.

   

 

.‘\s a result of this the American
student does not seem to Itave the
same serious attitude toward scho-
lastic work. Social functions play
an extremely large role itt college
life. The thing,r which Mr. Sanicl
points out as a summary of the
whole subject is the fact that the
American college is the model after
which those iii the Philippines are
taken. The faculty is largely comA
posed of Americans or America
trained men. The entire working
platt is modelled after our own
system here in the United States.

PROPAGANDA

llr. Charles UpSUII Clark spoke
in assembly Friday on "How Pro-
paganda Works." iecause of his
splendid trainini,r both at home attd
abroad and his interesting: cosmo-
politan experiences, he was able to
give to the students a very enter-
taining and instructive lecture.

Propaganda, a word which in
olden times was tttnclt honored and
esteemed, has tinally come to mean
design in favor of or against some
plan or idea. Accordingr to Dr.
Clark, there are three tnaitt kinds of
propaganda. humorous. true and
distorted, all of which produce re-
sults desirous or otherwise, with
regards to the viewpoint.

The humorous propaganda in the
form of funny stories he illustrated
by the example oi the Rumanian
story of the German minister whose
watch was stolen at a banquet =hy
the Balkan minister of Iinanee. and
was in turn stolen by the minister

 

oi :tti‘airs and returned to him. This
sort of thing. though seemingly tttv
signiﬁcant. produces the des‘tred
L

Distorted tales are those which
may most ' deceive us even
with |>lL‘lllt‘t .124 iii the ease of an
account of a ilnle'arian atrocity

spondcnt who went so I:  anur
t'arturinn- and plintoeraplting a
corpse of the bishop, who was no-
where near the scene oi action.

 
 

 

      

 

Another case of deliberate lies
was that of the llttnearians who
whined about the Ix‘ntnanian de\'.'ts«
tatinn ot‘ their country when all over
were signs of abundant luxury.

Ho steeped in the untrue stories,
heard of the lt'tmtanians, were. peo-
ple in foreign countries. that even
alter visible proof of their Likeness
they continued to believe the lies.

Speaking of present situations
which give rise ttl propaganda. |)r.
t'lnrk referred to the situation itt
'l‘ransylvania. which, by the peace
treaty, was given to littlnania.
The protest of Hungarian hishops
against the natural demands of the
victor 'ts prittted iii an .\tllt’t‘lc.’ltl
magazine, although it was but a
distorted I‘nrtn iii propaganda,

 

As an example of true propaganda
Dr. t'Iark told of a Ix'nntanian boy
of hi" own acquaintance who sni-
iered much in obtaining an educa-
tiott because of the llnne' i.'n
. attd whose lantilv was
_ terseeuted itt tittte of war
for no reason \t'hatsoever.

 

  

llavine warned us of what to look
for in the stories we hear. he cott-
eluded by sayingr that even when
they are authenticated by pltﬂltr
graphs we sltould not accept them
verbatim.
