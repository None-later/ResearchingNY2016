Moving-Up Day is our biggest annual “ All College ” Day, which
occurs in May. The entire day is given over to festivities.

First comes the more formal events in the chapel. Dr, llrnhaehcr
oﬂiciates and our entire faculty are seated upon the platform. At this
time a representative from each class speaks—sometimes formally, sonic-
times otherwise. ’I‘hen occurs the Moving-Up process, when each class
takes the seats formerly assigned to the preceding one, the seniors tak
ing those vacated by the treslnuen—for they are new and young in a
World by themselves. During this impressive ceremony the Moving-Up
Day song is sung.

Next in occurrence is the presenting of pins to the new senior
“News” editors in recognition of their services. This will become tra-
ditional, the '21 editors having been the first to receive these pills-

iiy far the most important event is the time when the members of

the old Myskania. one at a time, descends from his seat of honor on the
platform. marches tn the place where the selected junior sits, announces
the name, pins on him the purple and gold ribbon, and leads him to his
position upon the platform.

The seniors then lead the way to the chapel steps. forming an aisle
through which the following classes pass: each class. as soon as it passes
through, forming the aisle admit,r the walk. The old and the new
Myskania then pass through the aisle and lead the way to the planting of
the ivy.
