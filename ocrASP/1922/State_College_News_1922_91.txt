spot in America. Many places in
our country may boast more his-
torical ' nts, but “one so great a
one. 'l' battle that took place at
liree‘uan's farm in October, 1777,
ranks among the liftcen decisive
hat'les of the world’s history. it
was the turning point in the mis~
fortunes of the Continental Army
and in the successes of the liritish.
France, believing as the result of
this campaign, that the Colonists

a bullet in some ploughed ﬁeld.
Here. too, stands the gr 1th monu-

to remain loyal to his trust, would
stand the statue of licncdict
Arnold, than whom no man

Mr. l'liiliey and Mr. Waterman
of the history department, will

plain the signiﬁcance and topog
raphy of the spot.

Do not be mistaken and feel
that because the primary interest
in the trip will he historical, that
only members of the history de-
partment can go. Anyone can go,
whether he knows a word of his-
tory or not, or regardless at
whether or not he went last year.
Our only stipulation is that you
buy your ticket early, that you be
at college to start on time, and
that you bring your lunch with
you. It is thirty miles to the hat-
tlelield through the most beautiful
country, so that the ride alone is
easily worth the $1.25 that you
will pay for your ticket.

DR. MCCORD GIVES HEALTH

LECTURE

lint-tor McCord, of the State
Health Department, gave the ﬁrst
of a series of Friday afternoon
lectures-i a Week ago, before the
(.‘ollege Ntu‘sctt' Training Lrlass.
Doctor MeCord told lirst of the
trouble that the School nurse had
had in overcrmling the. prejudices
of the teacher, who at lirst had not
been too willingr to cooperate with
her, llut ten ytaru of ion
work and steady progress 1. do-
ing much to luring the nurse into
high favor with all of her asun-
riales.

'l‘he rth of the hour was spent
in showing lantern slides oi the
health work that is heng done in
lhe schools 0 Albany and the
vicinity. livery Albany school
child is given an examination
yearly, and the school nur. . set-s
to it that the doctor's suggestions
are carried out. and where the par-
ents are unable to meet the ex-
pense of proper medical care, the
toarvl of Education takes steps to
see that the child has the needed
attention. In Cases of tulmrrulos
the children are taken to a school
roof where other cases are also
kept. Here they sleep and play
and study out of doors, even in
the hitteth weather, protected by
their warm eskimo suits, aml
served warm nourishing fond
front the St‘ltunl kitchen.

it is no longer proper, l)nelor
MeCord \Vent on to say, to close
the schools because of an epi-
demic. if the schools are closed,
the children are only left free to
run the streets. and contract the
disease from their playmateq
if in case of contagious dis .
children are kept in school, they
can he examined daily he um
and doctors. in cases of diohlher
cultures can he taken, and those
showing signs of illness. can be
isolated and the spread of the
disease quickly and casin stopped.

It has long been known, how.
ever paradoxical it may seem, that
city children are more healthy
than the children of rural districts.
This was true in snitct of the much
boasted advantages of the country.
because as one man said the
country air was so line. because
everyone slant with their windows
closed. But with the school
nurse and the advent of more
sanitary rural schools, the country
is fast becoming as healthful a
place in which to live as the cily.

FIRST ORGAN RECITAL

On Wednesday afternoon, July
19, Prof. '1‘. Frederick H. Candlyn
gave the first of his series of organ
recitals at St. Paul's Episcopal
Church. Many availed themselves
of the opportunity to hear a mas-
ter of the pine organ, give several
selections. ioth the faculty and
student body ' were represented,

The program was as follows:
