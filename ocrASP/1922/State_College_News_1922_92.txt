Since the summer se sion heean
two wet-i=2: ago. there has heeu a
lahie in tile rotunda ior the sale oi
Student Association tickets :\s
yet only ahout Still) have been sold.
It sounds pretty small. doesn't it"
tint oi the 900 or more students
enrolled only 300 have shown tlteir
apnreci.’ition oi the 4)|'t|)(lt'lliiliiil3s
oiiered.

What is the matter? We know
you all like a good time. So that
can't he the reason. We know the
work is hard. and the weatiier is
lint, lint there is more to college
life titan lust hard plugging all the
time, Too much work tends
toward narrow - mindedness, a
tinnt.r which all teachers must
steer clear oi. (‘an it he that you
are shy and timid? it is hard to
heheve that in this modern age
there are, very many people ai-
iiit‘led witit such a malady.

So all the reasons why you
shouldn't huy a ticket are knocked
on the head. Now we come to
the question we could have
thrown at you in the iirst piaee.
\lhy don't you imy a Student
t s'sociation ticket? Then you can
enjoy life. Just think, a party
every week with lots oi extras
thrown in. Then. lastly. you get
each week a copy of the " News.”
it routes in very handy ii you
