STATE COLLEGE NEWS. JULY 25. I922

 

EVOLUTION OF THE
ll co-OP"

Two years ago the " Co~o ” did
not exist except in the mints of a
few who believed that a system
could be arranged whereb stu-
dents might obtain more (firectly
and at less expense the text books
and supplies necessary to them in
their college _work. The one to
make this idea a reality was Miss
Helen liay, one of State’s own
graduates and member of the Col-
lege History Department. In the
fall of 1920, iss hay. with no
capital save the enthusiastic back-
ing of the Faculty, opened the
Book Club, with as optimistic a
spirit as the girl must have had
who said she went through college
on faith in God and her sister’s
old clothes.

From this small beginning the
"Co-op' has grown to meet as
nearly as possible all the needs of
the college student. Eighteen
hundred checks were cashed dnr~
in},r the first year. This summer
alone. twulve hundred and thirty
text books have been sold. During
the summer we attempt to carry
a full line of drawing supplies. We
are glad to fill all individual orders
for books or other articles you
may desire.

Co-operation is not merely a
word to the manager of the “ Co-
op." It is a living principle, ac~
cording to which all our business
is transacted. Our books are sold
at a reduction from the list price.
All supplies are handled ml the
same basis. In short. we share our
profits with the student body.

During the summer one of the
special features is the book ex-
hihit, which is of course of great
interest and benefit to teachers.
This summer, beginning July 24.
in Room ii and the “ (Jo—op," there
will be exhibits from four different
publishing companies. The F. A.
Owen Company presents books
which are of special interest to
grade school teachers. Art teach.
ers will find the Scott. lioresnian
and Co. exhibit particularly help-
ful. Teachers of English will be
glad to see the books from
Houlghlton Mifflin. while those
specialising in geography or Amer-
icanization work, should examine
the display from the American
Book Company.

()ne of the most generally help-
ful departments of the Book Club
is that of the second-hand books.
We do not buy these books. but
we take them and sell them for
you at two—thirds the list price.
From this we deduct twenty per-
cent, sending you the remainder-
lt IS scarcely necessary to mention
the mutual benefit derived from
such an arrangement. On the see-
ond—hand shelves. you will find a
wide choice of books that you may
like to add to your library. Here
are a few of our present stock:

F iSTORY

Hayes: Political and Social His-
tory of Modern Europe. Vol. II.

FACULTY-STUDENT RE-
cemon

Friday evening the big electric
sign in the “gym” shone bright
and gay as a welcome to all of the
students of the summer session of

C T. Friends aml students of
last summer were reunited with
their old chums and met many
new friends besitles- In order to
facilitate the “get-together" part
or the program, each one of us
were a little white paper with our
names. addresses and occupations
all down in black and white.

r. llrubacher, the president of
the college, who was scheduled to
speak, was unable to be present.
l’rofessor Decker, director of the
summer session. refused to make
"a real speech." but he made the
matriculated students feel as
though they really had a hearty
and sincere welcome to State (Jol-
lcgc. Miss Grace Fox. the di—
rector ol the Social activities for
the summer aml a member of the
Class of '23, introduced the speak-
ers and told us of the good times
in store for us at the l’riday nigln
entertainments.

"hen we all formed two large
concentric circles and marched
around the "gym" to the sound
of good, snappy music and enter--
tained ourselves after the manner
of children “(ioing to Jerusalem."
For every time that the music
stopped, we literally grabbed our
nearest neighbor and talked her
head off until the music started
again. They told us to talk about
our favorite professors, but the
majority of us thought that that
was rather unwise. as a few 0
them were in the circles.

Aml then we had about two
hours of dancing. We danced
with our old friends. and we
danced with our new friends. The
latter part of the evouingr was
made especially pleasant as re»
freshnients were served. and who
is not ready to eat—especially
when the weather is hot and the
“cats” are in the form of ice
cream and wafers? When Charles
switched out the lights. and the
orchestra played “Home, Sweet
Home." we were de‘ermiued to
come to the parties every Friday
night and have as good a time as
we did at the Reception.
