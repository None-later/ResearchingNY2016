THE USE OF PICTURES IN
EDUCATION
Mr. Alfred Abrams. head of Db
vision of Visual Instruction. gave
an int ‘ llljJ,‘ den utstration and
:liseusston of the " l‘se of Pictures
in Education " on Momlay and
’l'uesday. .luly 24 and 25. The
meetings were held in the audi—

toriiun.

(Jn Monday Mr. Abrams de-
voted most of the time to demote
stration. Slides and a stereopticou
were used. The audience was
turned into a history class and
questions asked as the piclttres ap-
peai ‘ietnres connected with
the discovery of the Hudson were
shown. Among otlter slides were.
those picturing the warehouse of
the Dutch liast lndia (10., the pur-
chase of Manhattan island by the
Dutch. and Wall Street in those
early days. The picture of a house
built in Holland in 1650 shows eer~
tain features of architecture which
can be fotlnd in Albany to—day.
Slides showing manor houses near
the Hudson were interesting. The
Van Rensselaer manor house was
shown. also those at Tarrytown.
Yonkers. and in the lironx.

On Tuesday Mr. Abrams men—
tioned the two means by which we
express ideas—danguage and pic-
torial expression. Everything: that
exists in this world has size. form,
and position. These characteritics
can he expressed better by pictures
than thy laneua're. The teacher
must be careful that the pupils do
not generalize. The pictures must
be used with the understanding
that they apply to that one partic~
ular ca hservation. said r.
Athrams. is the essence of the vis-
ual method. One msut analyze a
picture as he would a paragraph.
The mind must visualize.

Motion pictures are useful when
we want to show motion. Their
expense makes them impractical
for the ordinary school. Also the
motion picture machine does not
offer opportunity for discussion.
For class instruction the best pic-
ture is the one shown on the
screen. All see it at the same
time. The pupil learns to read pic-
tures as he does literature.

The Department of Visual Edu~
cation will send slides, books. and
nrmts to any scl iu the state.
Any number of slides may be ob-
tained at one titne.

to ensure a successful summer at
State College. let us formulate our
aims at the beginning.r of the session.
l suppose that ﬁrst and foremost we
must secure as much educational ad-
vancement as possible in order that
we may go back to our schools with
new methods aml renewed inspira-
tions.

Let us also strive to make new
friends. because the possession of
friends is one of the tzreatest factors
in success as well as one of the great.
est factors of happiness.

We should also be happy the six
weeks that we spend in Albanv. Even
work seems much easier when we
are happy while puzzliue over a nrnb<
lem. And to secure the maximum
of happiness we must season our
lives with work. recreation. res“ and
friends.

City. addu td the class in immi-
grant l‘iducation last Tuesday.
There are many clas. s for the fur-

   

eigneis who cannot read or write
English in New York. In large
hotels. such as the liiltmore and
Waldorf \storia. it is possible to
hold classes right in the building.
and the employees can [rare the
kitchen and go right into another
room to learn English. it has also
been found expedient to hold
classes in factories. The men will
gladly stay an hour after work. but
these same men once they went
home would not willingly make
the effort to attend class later. The
men and women soon become in-
terested and enjoy studying. but at
first it is sometimes difficult to hold
them. Miss Reed l‘ere told a
funny story about a younp,r Greek.
His wife became concerned be—
cause he calne home later than
usual sont‘e evening's. She asked
him whv this was. but his re-
plv that be was studying English
did not fully satisfy her. She then
asked whether the teacher was a
man or woman. and knowing,r that
if he told the truth he would not
be allowed to attend. he. answered
“A man." Jtut a few days later
this watchful wife paid a sltrpr
visit to the class. and when she
found the teacher to be a woman.
boldly marched ltitu away before
all the class. and the young Greek
never came back aeain.

llesides holdinr cla "s in hotels
and factories. the l. is s meet in
the public schools. and libraries.
the union halls. amt the churches.
Some of the immigrants even go
so far as to pay for their meeting
olaccs and alsn for their own text-
books. The Americanization as it
is now beingr carried on in New
York reaches hundreds of every
nationality. hinese. Russians.
ltalians. Poles, Hungarians. Por-
tu'zuese, Czeech-Slovaks. Greeks. and
all the many other European na<
tionalities.
