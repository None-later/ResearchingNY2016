YOUR EXTRA COURSE

Are you a teacher? Probably
you came to summer school to
make yourself a more valuable
member of your profession. Then
you should not forget the extra
course which it is essential for
you to take during the summer
session. Perhaps you are already
proﬁcient in the art of pausing, of
catching up. of relaxing. Perhaps
you are already able to secure en-
joyment from the little pleasures
found by the way. not. begin
to-day to cultivate that art. and
see how much more pleasure there
is in life than you ever before
dreamed of.

Do you rllsh about from morn~
ing until night. from work to play.
and from play to work? t is an
[\merican habit. and causes us to
miss something,r in life which our
European cousins have. Can you.
for more than sixty seconds at a
time. enjoy a sunset.‘a beautiful
tree. the song of a bird. the color
of a rose. or the smile ofa child?
How many lovely things thch are
all about us which we miss because
we pass too hastily byl

You say there isn’t time in the
(lav for this pausing. for this quiet
enioyment of the beautiful little
things in life. Remember that.
after all. this is your holiday. and
that if every minute of the time
IS spent in an intense use of
energy. next winter will find you
lacking in the pep which makes
life worth living and that although
your head will be stored full of
information. the joy of imparting
it to others will be lacking. Sup-
pose you do learn a little less of
book lore. 0n the whole vour
life will be richer. your happiness
more complete. and consequently
your usefulness greater.

Then. too. there are the Odd
moments of the day' which may be
used to advantaqc. What do vou
see. and of what do you think
while you are waiting on the
dusty. hot corner for a car? Are
you inwardly filming because of
time wasted. or are you enjoying
the hlucncss of the sky above. and
the rich red of the geraninms in
the window-box nearbv? How do
you use your time of waiting in

D‘Y’ WANNA GO UP IN THE
AIR?

How about a ride? No I didn't
mean a trolley car. Everybody has
had an opportunity to try the
street cars by this time. l am sure.
l’ll bet most of you rode up grand
old State street. registration day.

those of you who were arriving for
the first time, when you saw the

and as you are sailing along Just
peek down on the capiol. the l‘ldn-
cation building. and State College.
Of all the cute play houses—well—
you'll want to take them all home
with you. And the trains—they
are tllc ctiuningcst little play cars
"on ever saw in your life. You betl
——they have the electric trains beat

reservoirs are the loveliest l)ll‘(l-
l‘aths you ever saw. Now. honest.
i am not kiddingr a bit. and I could
tell you a lot more. but I don't
want to spoil your thrill. Just one
more word in closing. licst of all.
there is no need for fear. You
don’t get any horrid sensations
either going up or coming,r down.

VACATION SPENT IN SUM-
MER SCHOOL.

Many of us have been seriously
asking ourselves the question:
“ Whv spend your vacation in sum-
mer school?" To most of us the
answer is dclinite enough to lit
that one particuar case of our own.
even though there may be as many
different answers as there are stu-
dents in State. College who are ac~
tually teachers in the lield at the
present time.

Manv are here to earn either
their baccalaureate or Masters de-
gree and as such are to be com-
mended for desiring this proof of
good work well done. Many are
here for work which will help them
in the State examinations which
are to be held in August. and feel
a need of dustng some of the cob-
wcbs from their psychology or
other subject matter before it is
Offered to the State Department of
Education for inspection.

liut it has seemed to the writer.
in observile the serious mien of
those who are in the thlSSTOOIH
that there is a motive underlying
this apparently selfish one of ma-
lCl‘l’Il gain: that there is a more
noble and glorious purpose. that of
ﬁtting our minds for the needs of
our pupils for the next year and for
the years to come. The pupil is.
or should be. the basis of all edn~
cation. and that which the pupil
needs is the thing in which we are
most interested.

Self~sumciencv is (unite apt to be
a weakness of the teacher who has

A HARD DAY

“I‘ve had a hard day.” said the
tired business man aboard the even-
in},r lrain for home. “ One of my
ollice boys asked for an afternoon
off to attend his aunt’s funeral. So
being on to his scheme. as l. thought.
I said I'd no aloui-t‘. too.

His friend chuckled. “ Great idea!

THE. HOUSE OF THE DEAD

 

There is a peculiar institution in
Chinese cities known as the House
of the Dead. These houses stip-
uly the need which arises from the
Chinese custom of never burying
their dead until the propitious day
has cotue and the lucky place is
found. Sooth-saycrs are consulted
in these most important matters
and often the burial is postponed
again and again. until four or live
vcars have passed by. Meanwhile
the body must be kept somewhere.
and in the homes of the poor is
often placed in the living room,
where the casket may be used for
a seat; or in crowded homes, it
lies out of doors until the sootlu
sayer has drained the last possible
t‘oppcr from the poor mourners.
llut those who are stitlicicntly
wealthy. hire a room in the death
house. where the departed one
may lie in state.

One of the most interesting: of
these death houses is found in Can~
ton. it is similar to an American
hospital. in that the rooms are ar-
ranged in rows. each side of a lone
central corridor. The body is
covered with lime and sealed in a
heavy black casket which is en-
tircly concealed hv a crimson
satin throw. embroidered in gold
thread. Each room is otherwise
furnished much as a bedroom. with
a support for the casket. substi-
tuted for the bed. Upon a small
table is placed food. money. and
other articles which the deceased
might need in his new habitation.

Some Chinese. even after they
are converted to Christianity.
cling to this custom of their an-
cestors. A missionary of Anking
was asked bv his Chinese assistant
for a three days' leave of absence
or the purpose of burying his
father- The missionary nave his
consent at once and offered his
svmpathy and help at this time of
sorrow. But the young.r assistant
explained that. although the burial
had not yet taken place. his
father’s death had occurred more
than three years previously.

 

POINTS OF INTEREST
No. l. The Capitol

The thing for which Albany is
noted more than any other is the
fact that it is the capital of the “ lint-
uirc State." Therefore it has the
'zrcatcr part of the State ofﬁces in-
catcd within its boundaries. Al the
h'ad of the State street hill. presid-
in'; over the destinies of the city and
State. is the capital.

This gigantic pilc, iinisbed in the
late 90‘s. furnishes great opportuni—
ties to the student of art 'tnd architec
ture. The staircases are all marvel-
oltsly wrought in stone. The main
staircase in particular. the so-callcd
million dollar staircase. is a thing of
"rent beauty. lt is cut out of a sin~
'rlc rock of red eranile. All the carv-
ing has been done by hand by two
ltnlian sculp‘ors.

The 1building is traversed by nu»
Incrous passage
these corridors give one some idea
of the bianess of the building. (\ll
are inlail with Mosaic. the patterns
of “ no two of uhich are alike.” it
has been known lll'tl people can very
easily lose lhcmst-lves by followng
these devious p Ines.

A place where there is some at-
traction for everyone is the execu-
ive chamber. There is no person
who can resist the opportunity to sit
in the chair of tie governor. It
makes one feel so important and is
an accomplishment that can be
boasted about for a long time. Then
there are the chambers of the Senate
and Assembly. No teacher should
leave Albany without seeing the
nlaccs where the laws of the State
are made.

On the main floor at the head of
the longr lliTht of steps leading from
the park in front of the building is a
museum containing many relics of
the past. which as historical rem-
nants are invaluable. Here are battle—
ﬂags and nuns front every war in the
lon’? historv of New York State.

This brief account is written to re-
veal snmc facts about the govern-
ment seat of the State, that you may
desire to visit it before you go home.
There are always guides at band
who will take you through the
buildingr for a small remuneration.
