STEP CHILDREN

State College is Very glad to \Vel-
come l'ourteen (llll graduate slu-
dents. a record number this year.
'l‘hesi- students repres‘nt various

' ol' the United States and also
'ountries. Because of their uu~
l'amil irity with the city and lack
ol' alliliation with a'ny one class at
collop‘e they should receive the | )e-
cial consideration and l'riendly .Itti~
tude of the entire student body. They
are not presented with handboole nor
have they any “Junior sisters" to
assist them. One of them ha. i'i
that he was even “e'i'eener” than a
freshman. ’l‘hey have chosen State
College from all other eolh-e-s to
come to. so let each State College
student do all that he can to \\"‘iC0m(.‘
them and to make them feel that
they have chosen wisely.

dent who “was never athletic in hie'h
school and wonders st how she can
not in the live to 5. hours ol’ active
exercise which Dr. Crussilaie advises
urgently for all students. it you
have never participated in any sport,
choose one such as tennis or hockey.
Then, if you have chosen a sport.
which has special practices, attendl
them, all and every one and tbe‘
chances are you’ll make your class
team. If you choose a more individ-
ual sport, such as tennis. write a
note to your sport captain and she.

rienced person may become really:

A REVOLUTION

’l‘hursday afternoon, September 28.
an air of mystery pervaded the cor-
ridors of State Collep Through
the corridor a peculiar odor seemed
to he waited. and no one could tell
from whence it came. it even pene-
trated to the upper hall. and many a
conjecture was made as to its source.

    

On descending the stairs to the
lower hall. the trail seemed to grow
stronger. but yet the perfume riu
unlined a strange one. More than
one l'resl‘nnun stood by the mail box
and Inedilated. it was evident that
the source of ti - excl nent was not
Far away. At t one brilliant l'resh-
man exclaimed “Ah! low I remem-
ber. About hall' an hour ago i saw
the Janitor. wenrine‘ knickers. come
down the hall With a pail ol' paint. l
recall it distinctly because I had to
(lode-e the horrid thin}: to save my
new sweater.” At that the whole
group e‘athered around the mail box
shouting. “Why how stupid ol‘ us, of
course it’s paint." And indeed it
was. But then came the iiurstfon.
“What was heine' painted?" Could
it be true? It was the Ni'lWS oilice.

When 3:00 o’clock classes were
out, the members of the News board
[locked to the ofﬁce. More than one
nearly succumbed to the surprise ol‘
seeing the color of the oll‘ice walls
undereoine' such a chance.

The ollice has now had two coats
of paint and the improvement is very
noticeable; a new electric ﬁxture has
been added which will l'urther im-
prove the l'acilities ol' the oilice. The
News board has taken the lirst step
toward a better paper: better condi—
tions under which to work.

   

 

LOST AND FOUND

The News ofﬁce will be, from
now on. the one and only custodian
of the Lost and Found box. Come
in any time it is open and one oi.“ the
stail will open the box. It will ﬁrst
be necessary. however. to describe
the lost article in order to claim it.

I On account of the frequent
demand for house matrons in
the present student houses,
Dean Pierce asks any student

, knowing; women who would

meet the resuirements for such

a position to report their names

and addresses to her ofﬁce.
