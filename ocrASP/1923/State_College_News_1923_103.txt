if you do not believe that what is

 

sauce for the goose is sauce for the
gander, come to the play “Suppreued :
Deiiiren" and see this old adage;
proved. The theme of this play will‘
be of particular interest to all psy—
chology students since it deals in a
refreshing manner with the Freudian
theory of dream interpretation.
The denouement of the plot comes
when the wife discovers that through V
her enthusiasm for psychoanalysis,‘
her sister discovers suppressed de-
sire t'or “Step hen.” it is not strange i
that the wife does not recognize,
“Step hen” to mean Stephen, her"!
husband. As 1'

.or her husband’s de-
sires—come to the college auditorium
on Tuesday night, October 16, and
see the advanced Drainatic’s class:
present “Suppressed Desires.” i
This play, which is under the di-
rection of Marion Farrell. is the first
of a series of one-act plays to be
presented by the class under the di—i
rection of individual members. l~le|e—.
nea [iorsick will present the second
play at the end oi.‘ October. ‘
Students of the college will be ad-
mitted on presentation of their stu-
dent tax tickets. Visitors are wel-
come. A nominal fee will be charged
at the door.

First Game Lost

SECOND GAME WITH WORCES-
TER TECH OCTOBER 13

State’s grid warriors were defeated
by the St. Lawrence University ele-

iven at the home of tbeIScarlet play-

ers Saturday. Oct. 5. With a score of
St to 0

At no time were State’s men able
to gain on the St. Lawrence line,
yet during no period did the'Pui'plc
and Gold let doivn on their playing,
and at the end of the game with
defeat a certainty, they were still
putting up a still‘ ﬁght.

While our men did not bring away
a victory. they brought back the
compliments of President liykcs of
the University on their clean play-
ing and sportsmanship.

State’s next game is with Worces-
ter Tech. at Worcester Oct. 13. Here
again our men are bucking up against
a hard and fast playing team, but we
can only hope for the best and back
them up to the ﬁnish.

After three more out of town
games State plays its first home
game with the Union fresh. Here
we may expect some snappy playing
on the part of the Purple and Gold
eleven.

IGNORANCE FOREVER BAN-
ISHED FROM '27

The 1923 freshmen of State Col-
lege ‘were fully initiated last Friday
evening. Oct. 5. when the enthusiastic

‘llllllllllcl‘s of the Sophomore class es-
‘corted them to limlierger cheese and

cats’ eyeballs! One of the fresh

.Iioldly asked if that was the sopho-

mores’ diet! ! ,

'I‘he tortuous contrivances arranged
for the evening made evident the
fact that sophs still held bitter mem-
ory of a similar event given for their
benelit in 1922.

A l'ter much “undoing” of hair and
powdering of noses generally, the
newcomers were blindfolded, and to
insure themselves that nothing could
possibly be seen, the wise sophs
tucked coton up under the bandages.
Down to the “death chamber" the
fresh were escorted—alt first very
game for the occasion, later feeling

the due soleinnity, trembling and
fearful. When fealty was pledged
to the Sophomore class then the

to curl that hair so carefully and to
powder that nose, the good supply of
cold water immediately proved that.
A quantity of cream and green paint
was then administered. The victims
walked the tight rope with great skill
and thus were encouraged to take
up the profession: The sophs ar-
ranged ll. little roller-coaster affair
