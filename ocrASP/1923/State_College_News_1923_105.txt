FIRST FRESHMAN LECTURE ‘
Dean Pierce gave her first lecture;

to the Freshman women Thursday at'- i

ternoon. She warned them that each;

one, from the first day of her college;
course, was making a reputation ,forl
herself, and. that it was a chance
to begin a fresh page, and to change
habits which had made former ac-
quaintances think her peevish, sel-
iish, or the like. She also gave them
some advice on how to study, telling
them that the best results could be
obtained by having definite hours for
study. and equally ilelinite hours for
recreation, keeping up lessons day by
day, studying hard. but not inces-
saiitly.

CIRCUS COMES TO TOWN

’i'he circus is coming to town. or
rather the circus is already here, but
it hasn‘t mobilized. To come down
to cases, this year Campus Day will
take the form of ii regular circus,
with all the iixiii’s. 'l‘bere will be
animals an’ clowns an’ three rings
and the whole of the “Greatest Show
on lilartli” will parade through the
streets of Albany. The talent? Surc-
1y there are enough gifted ones in
State for this production.

“Wait for the big show a week
from tomorrow” is the counsel of theI
members of the committee from the
four classes which met last Tuesday
to plan the details.

LETTER MEN AS MATERIAL

The number of letter men still in
State shows that the college will have
good material to build upon this year.

A FRESHMAN’S VIEW

liike sheep to the slaughter is the
only expression which des- ibes the
initiation of the 3in freshmen last
Friday evening. The only hitch was
due to the fact that some of the sheep
seemed to think they were goats and
were inclined to be balky. 'l‘akcn all
in all, however, the initiation was one

 

 

 

 

 

 

   

of the best in many years. Under
the careful watch of Myskania,
seconded by Prof. Hastings, who,

 

from an elevated post swept the gym
filoor With eagle eyes, the freshmen
,were put through their paces In ii
:way satisfactory to the most blood~
ithll‘h‘ty Sophomores. Evidently they
1realized the solenniity of the occa-
ision, which was further impressed
. upon them by an unseen oracle whose
vmce bade them approach the ordeal
‘Wltil becoming seriousness. (The
awe—inspiring VOICI', by the way, was
that of Harry Godfrey of the “News”
;stail’.)

l Shivering (or maybe laughing in-
‘wardly) after the porteiitous words
oi the dignified Mr. Godfrey. the
Fresh were plunged down the dark
and steep iii-scent to the lower re-
gions whei'e unseen demons hail pre-
pared tortures for them. After the
tack walking, cheeses eating and
branding had been i'endurcd, the
freshmen approached the supreme
test, the cats' eyes eating. All the
torture of the doomed were combined
in this last “stunt,” and when it was

violent exer . consisting of being
dragged through a noisy collection of
wands, dumb-bells and Indian Clubs.
When the bandages hail been re-
.movcd from their eyes, the freshmen
1took delight in watching their tardy
classmates suffer. Then all they had
jto do was to ﬁnd their particular shoe
[in a pile of three hundred and to re-
move a mixture of talcum powder,
.pulverizcd moth balls and green and
lwliite paint from their faces.

‘ “Wait until next year and see what

 

,‘DI’: its ﬁnancial success will appear 1 we do to the class of 1921‘,” were the

lﬁnal words of most of the freshmen
ias they left the building after the
' dancing.
