MASQUERADE A SUCCESS

Brightly-colored costumes and
bright faces formed a colorful back-
ground for the Junior Freshman Hol-
lowe’en masquerade dance held last
Friday in the State College gym.
Three hundred students, decked in
costumes both gay and amusing,
danced for three hours at what has
been termed the most successful af-
fair of its kind held for many moons.
Old-fashioned ladies with full skirts
trying to speak with eyes aml fans,
wilely women from harems and dar-
ling grandmothers looked on disap-
provineg while jaunty sailors whisk-
ed their lady loves about the gym
floor.

During the evening a flashlight
photograph of the dancers was taken
and the Junior class presented Ralph
Harris. temporary freshman chair-
man, with the mascot which will this
year be the property of the freshmen
and will be sought by the sopho-
mores.

Following a grand march about the
floor the winners of the costume
prizes were announced and the lucky
ones called forward to receive the
prizes. Faculty members were the
patronesses.

We may think we are fools for re-

be teachers, but the more we read
about other folks the more we be—
come convinced we are not the only
fools.

Word is going around that the
State is going to start building an
addition to State College. if it takes
as long to build it as it has taken
for arguments whether it should be
built or not, most of us will be en-
joying our sabbatical years when they
begin to curve the name over the
threshold.

Speaking of sabbatical years re-
minds us of what Professor Risley
said last summer just before he left
to give the Ruhr valley the once-over.
He said he hoped the box cars on
the French railroads were more com—
fortable than be imagined the Amer-
ican ones were.

’in an English IA class. The fresh—

lhad been in the air at two-thirty

“Button, button, who’s got the but-
ton?” the sophomores are asking this
week and 300 freshmen women are
wearing their new green and white
buttons to prove that they are prop-
erly submissive. The buttons were
issued last week. The freshmen men
are eagerly awaiting the ﬁrst snow
that they may secure their toques,
which they think will not be as bad
as the caps they are now wearing.
“At least they can’t be any worse,"
say the freshmen.
