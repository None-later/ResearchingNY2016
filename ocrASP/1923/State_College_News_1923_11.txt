Anyone who has heard or heard oi'
Ruth Draper will be delighted with

James B. Pond of New York City.
She has appeared before the crowned
heads of Europe and has been re-
ccived with interest and .applause
Her Original Character Sketches ”
have been called " monologues ”
However, they are more than " mono~
logues ". One does not feel that she
is giving a one«sided conversation,
One sees that she is portraying char-
acters, one recognizes the types. The
stage seems set for a play and filled
in reality Miss
Draper alone is there.

” The moment Miss Draper comes
upon the stage she challenges your
interest. She holds it until the very
last of her numbers. She changes
rapidly from one type to another as
her program proceeds, swaying her
audience through the entire range
of emotions, yet one never tires of
her artbecause it is natural and so
free from’ mannerisms. " It is a re-
tresbing novelty in the theatre.”

” It is scarcely, an exaggeration to
describe Miss Ruth Draper as the most
accomplished of living reeiters."
‘Sunday Times, London '

as she is charming. she is a ﬁne Artist
