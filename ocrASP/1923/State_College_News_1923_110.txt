STUDY HOURS STARTED FOR
NEWMAN CLUB

An interesting- feature on the New-

man Calendar is the Study Hour. The

hours for study are from 7 o’clock

until nine at 741 Madison Avenue 

every Wednesday. All Newman
Freshmen are invited to Newman Hall
to get assistance in any subject that
troubles them. Eﬂieient upperclass-
men are in charge of the different
departments. Already, through the
cil'orts of Father Dunney, a library
of all the books needed in the Fresh-
man year has been collected. Al-
though the new project has been
tried only two evenings, a large eath-
ering of interested and puzzled Fresh
has been present and we hope to see
more of the class of ’27.
