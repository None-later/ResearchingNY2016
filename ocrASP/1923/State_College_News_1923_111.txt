Day after day he is in his little‘

faithfulness to his adopted Alma Mil“

part the special work of one of the
classes. Sub-committees from each
of the classes appointed by the Presi-

the affair. There will be clowns,
bareback riders. strong men. animals,
acrobats, etc., besides the usual side—
shows. The freshmen and the sopho-

sociations of friendly faculty, charm-

by palms and banners into a reception
hall, and a general atmosphere of
,iollity. From three-thirty to five-
,thirty on the afternoon of October
27, Intersororlty is at home in the
college rotunda to the college.

It is the most attractively friendly
social event of the year. 'l‘he‘alum-
nae return to chat with “those who.
pour,” for each sorority is repre-
sented by seine of her former mem-

.l “and to compare such former
events as teas which annually cast
their shadows before. All the stu-
,dent body comes to forget the tests
,‘of the past week and the quizzes
iul.’ the next in a fraternal and joy-
ous mingling of tea, facultyI little
,cakes, and fun,——and, of course,
jduncing‘ and music.
