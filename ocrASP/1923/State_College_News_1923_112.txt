“IF THE SHOE FlTS—"

If you get a new but you pay [or
it. if you get a magazine every
month you pay for it. If you get a
copy of the NEWS every week, why
not pay for that, too?

It isn’t fair for some graduates to
pay three dollars a year for the
NEWS when others have it sent them
for nothing by their friends in Col-
lege. ’I‘he students pay their tax
which entitles them to one copy of
the NEWS each week. it probably
does not occur to them that there is
any harm in taking just one or two
extra copies. Nor does it seem wrong
to the receivers of those extra copies
that they get them for nothing. The
trouble. without doubt, is due to
thoughtlessncss; but when the case
is judged fairly. there is only one
verdict: it is unfair to the NEWS and
its subscribers to “get yours for
nothing."

A MISTAKE
'l‘ho NEWS regrets that due to a
mistake of the printer. several of the
most important articles and notices
were omitted from the last issue.
Great care will be taken that such a
mistake will not happen again.

FORMER EDITOR IN EUROPE

Kenneth P. Holben, '20, Kappa
Delta Rho, a former lilditor-in-chief
of the “News”, was in Europe during
the summer. While there he spent
some time with Richard O’Brien, ’20,
who was studying French at the Uni-
versity of Geneva. Mr. Hollien is
new teaching at the Hotchkiss School,
Lakevillc, Connecticut.

WRlTES ON NEWS MORALS

Jerome H. Walker of the junior
class, a member of the NEWS stall‘,
is the author of an interesting article
on journalistic morals which appeared
in a recent issue of the “City Editor
and Reporter,” a representative news-
paper trade organ.

A fresh speaking to an uppcrclass-
man: "Where is that good looking
1girl Minerva that so many of the
‘sophomorc :i‘cllows have been tulkn‘ig
about? ’l‘hcy say that she’s in the
hall every, day but I haven't been
able to catch sight of her yet.”

New Type of History

A freshman was rambling along,
trying to form an acceptable reply
to a question asked of her in History
Quiz when Prof. Wegner interrupted
with: “ c you ever go swimming,
Iiss ?”

“Sometimes.”

“Do you swim?”

“A little.”

“Did you ever get in deep water
when you didn’t know how to get
out?"

“Yes.”

“Do you feel that way now?"

“Yes.”

thrcupon the question was passed
on to the next unfortunate.

j Swell Up Seniors!

‘ “li‘reshmen should cultivate lull _seii-
liars and thus gain poise and dignity,
él’rol'essor Sayles told one of his
‘classes last week. The fact that it was
not Freshmen but Seniors who re-
ceived this pearl of wisdmn makes the
cynical suspect Professor Saylcs of
sarcasm. But not so the .eniors thcm‘
;sol\'cs. 'l‘hey believe every word of it
iand they also think that his added
:admonition to “be especially nice to
ithc prominent seniors," applies to ev-

, lf speech is silver and silence is
golden, State College is certainly
ililesscd by an ample supply of the
iyellow colored metal. Have you ob-
served the modest and retiring fresh-
,men men stalking stealthin about the
halls, trying in o my way to avoid
speaking to their school mates of the
opposite sex? And have you noticed
‘how some of them avoid the gym and
the joys of dancing? And such po-
,litenessl it’s Mister this, and Mister
,that, for a number of the freshmen
imen this week. No, it isn’ta miracle;

1given an intelligence test at the close
.of chapel which supplanted the sche-
,duled election of oilicers. Reports
ifrom this test showed that although
some of the freshmen were not exact-
,ly sure whether a monkey wrench or
:an apple was most like a peach, the
general average of intelligence was
,cxceptionally llgigh).r

After seeing Bob Crawford’s cute
little upper lip decoration in the daily
newspapers so often of late, most of
.the men have begun cultivating the
so-called mustaches. Pretty soon it
will be time for Bob to shave his off
and fool the gang who think they can
.look like him.

PATRONIZE «smashes

The Red Cross. national and inter-
national, recognizes the fact that in
the American colleges and universi-
ties of to-day is to be found its lead-
ership for to-morrow, In a work which
perhaps more than any othc' is inter
proting to the world at large the full
scope and meaning of the ideal of
the Brotherhood of Man. Colise—
quontly, it voices at this time an an»
pcal to the students of America, not
only for support in“. the oncoming
American National lied Cross ltoll
Call, November 1 Hill, but for serious
constructive study of the work ano
methods of the organization.

Will you not, therefore, stand with
the unconuucrable will of a Sidnv'
liiinier to the ideal of service?
’l‘hrough years of poverty which ll('
could have changed by sacrifice of
his ideals, and through n greater
number of years of illness from tu«
berculosis which he had not the pow-
cr to change, the beloved poet of the
Southliind struggled on, until with a
temperature of 104, and while too
weak to feed himself, he pcnciled his
last and greatest poem, “Sunrise”,
afraid that he would die ere the com-
lotion of his task.
