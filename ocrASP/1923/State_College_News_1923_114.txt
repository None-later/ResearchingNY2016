Six promising: freshmen are not

speaking to girls for two weeks. One H

week‘. is past forever, but another
Week is yet to come, and many a fair
damsel may be captured in the space
of seven days. Ed Van Kleek seems
to be suffering most of all, handing
out slips to the girls informing them
he is unable to speak. As if the girls
minded!

The others are maintaining; a
forced silence. but being" naturally of
a more quiet nature are not missed
so much. The little tag on Kent
Pease’s coat leads one to suspect that
it is initiation. Bill Clark,
Reginald Dixon, Ralph Harris adn
Herford Smith are the other Vlctlma
who will be given an opportunity to
practice house-cleaning: at the

 

house over the week-end.

 

NEED OF CIVILIZATION IS
NEED OF TEACHERS

Free schools and compulsory atten<
dance are new experiences. No pow-
er at government can brim: to them
success. ll.‘ they succeed it will be
throuin the genuine'eﬂ'ort and sup-
port that can come only from the
people themselves. It is this condi-
tion that makes the position of‘ the
teacher rise to such high importance.

The standards which teachers are
required to maintain are continually
rising. Their work takes on a now
dignity. It is rising: above a calling,
ubow: a profession, into the realms
of on art. it must be digniﬁed by
technical training, ennobled by char-
acter, and sanctified by faith. It is
not too much to say that the need
of civilization is the need of teachers.
The contribution which they make to
human Welfare is beyond estimation.

-—l’resident Coolidge.

GIRLS TAKE NOTE

Kappa Delta Rho accounts for the
mute Freshmen who walk throth
the corridors, smiling; but refusing to
speak. Initiation into Kappa Delta
Rho forbids their talking; to all girls
for a period of two weeks. For fear
their acquaintances will be insulted
the ailiicted ones pass out slips of
paper explaining circumstances.
