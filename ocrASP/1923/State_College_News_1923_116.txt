Sage Score: Fire! Touchdown

i Bring on the next victim!
i Keyed up to a high pitch of en-
lthusiasm as a result of their thorough.
.'ly convincing victory over the De.
istroyer Brock eleven, State’s hard-
[llg'lllLiIltt' grid warriors anxiously await
,lthe start of the impending struggle
twith the Union Cubs this afternoon
lat liidgcilcld park.

‘ ’l‘he Garnet yearlings will enter tin-
icontest a decided favorite by virtue
toi' their spotless record so far this
{season ovn' formidable teams. It will
flie termed the “Battle of lii'ains,” for
{neither of the teams has the advan-
ititge in weight.

   
 

‘,the insation of a day of extraordi-

illitl'lly interesting football in the east'
i——-as far as State college is concerned. :

ilt was the making of the team.

i > The Iiuskey gobs battered away ill
lState’s almost impregnable line, but
‘the sense of victory was too strong.
‘l'lven uncanny forward passing failed
‘to not anything more than a slight
gain new and then only to find the
‘ .apitol Hill boys ready to carry the
‘ball back.

To “Red” Sage, the diminuitive
:pilot and backiield Iiash, goes the
‘lionor of scoring the first touchdown
ifor a State College football team

'since the ﬁrst game of last season.‘

Running the ends, plunging through
the line and skirting the tackles, Sage
was almost unstoppable in the first

period when he made a sensational.

n'ash down the field with the ball

snagged tightly in his arms.

The other notable epoch in State's-

football history, which has finally
.been inscribed with victory, came in
jthe third quarter, when the some
itoppeil Gilchrist dashed through the

‘opposing line, intercepted a perfectly ‘
directed forward pass, and gallopped:
across the goal line for another six‘

points.

There is no doubt that State would
ihave piled up a more formidable ap-
3pearing score it' it had not kept to
the old-fashioned defensive style of
Cornellian football. The men played
a brilliant, almost inechanicaliy per—
l‘ect game. rl‘hcy moved as though
the master hand of Fritz Wegner,
their crafty coach. were hovering
over each man on tiic team.

Composed of husky seamen, the
Brock team was no “set up.” At
times their loose and faulty playing
iwas costly to them. but on the whore

State won a cleancut victory. The
