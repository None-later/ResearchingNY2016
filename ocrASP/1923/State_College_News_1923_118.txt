“I did not think—

I investigated”

One day in 1895, Roentgen noticed that a
cardboard coated with ﬂuorescent material
glowed while a nearby Pluecker tube was
in action. "What did you think?” an
English scientist asked him. “I did not
think; I investigated,” was the reply.

Roentgen covered the tube with black
paper. Still the cardboard glowed. He took
photographs through a pine door and dis-
covered on them a white band correspond-
ing to the lead beading on the door. His
investigation led to the discovery of X-rays.

Roentgen’s rays have proved an inestim-
able boon to humanity. In the hands of
doctor and surgeon they are saving life
and reducing suffering. In the hands of
the scientist they are yielding new knowl-
edge—even of the arrangement and
structure of atoms. The Research Labora-

Pagc 'I‘hroc

tories of the General Electric Company
have contributed greatly to these ends by
developing more powerful and efﬁcacious

X-ray tubes.
