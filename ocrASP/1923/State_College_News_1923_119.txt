Professor Kirtland says that he be-
lieves that it is a mistake to think
that any one course in part’cular can
supply mental training better than
another. He believes that the amount
of mental training gained from ex-
plicit subjects is gained not so much
from the subject itself, as from the
training which it gives. To say do-
ﬂnltely that a child who detests mu-
thematics will of a certainty gather
more from that subject than from
any other is an erroneous supposit'o.i,
but the variety of courses oll‘cred in
the list of required subjects of most
colleges makes it almost ccztin that
there will be some subjects amone
them which will ﬁll the requirement.

lege held its second meeting- of the

“Give the men bigger portions than
the girls.” is what Miss Thompson. of
the cafeteria told members of her
class in lunch room management.
“They are always huna'rier uml they
need more to out.” she snld. “It's
no easy job to feed three hundred
hungry people every noon. but we
can always tell what they are going
to out most of. The favorite dish?
0h. potatoes, by all means. potatoes!
They eat them by the barrel, and
with gallons of gravy. That is, the
students do. The faculty don't seem
to eat as much. Maybe its because
they are brain workers. The women
of the fucuitv eat less than the men,
usually a cup of tea, seine salad and
dessert. Genm'ally the men get a
reeular luncheon.” “Don't you think
that some students out more than they
should?” the ews reporter asked.
watching a fat girl dodge the cocoa
and reach for pickle sandwiches. “I
don’t believe so,” replied Miss 'l‘liomp- l
son. “You know the football meni

everybody to not all they want and ‘
not to up away hungry. I like to
see the students eat and they certain- .
ly like eating. Vegetable and toma- i
to soups are always popular, and ol' 1
the desserts pie runs 'wuy ahead—~i
when they can get it. Everybody}
eats a tremendous amount ol‘ lce’
cream.” i
Here is what Miss Thompson says1
State students should do to co-operato l
with the cafeteria management: speak l
louder so that the girls can tell
whether it is potatoes or tomatoes
that you want; keep in line and be
lorderly. and. by all means, come back |
‘1 for more if you don’t get enough the i
