AN ACKNOWLEDGMENT
In accordance with the custom of

former years the junior editors on the.

“News " Board have been given this
issue to do with it as they please.
It is their op ortunity to demonstrate
their origins ity and Journalistic abil-
ity. For two and a half years they
have worked hard for this chance to
“run' the per." During this long
while they ave been members of that
unheard of group [that has labored at
news gathering and proof readin .
But for this Junior Issue we, t e
senior editors, step aside and allow
our co—workers of ’24 to take charge.
Therefore, whatsoever degree of merit
that this issue attains is due to the
juniors. All praise that it deserves
should be accorded them. We extend
our best wishes to the juniors editors
and to the entire class of '24.

They say it is our op ortunity to de-
monstrate our origins ity and ournal-

ing. Alas!

But for this Junior Issue the senior
editors have stepped aside and al-
lowed us, their co-workers of ’24 to
take charge. Therefore whatsoever
little degree of merit that this issue
attains may be attributed to us. We
extend our hearty thanks to the sen.
ior editors for their trust in us. ’

New opportunities, new enthusi‘
asms, new resolutions-all these things
should be sugested by the opening of
the new semster. And how shall we
useit? _ ln lamenting that we did not
accomplish more in the past, in dream
ing of what we shall do in the future?
Laments servd their purpose when
they tend to make us humble. Dreams

V have their place since through them

we escape’the evils of monotony. But
neither should be permitted tousurp
the position or‘ honest thinking and
hard working as applied to the pres-
sent. Dust should not accumulate on
today's task.,while we put, willows on
yesterday's or laurels on tomorrow’s.
The kecnest enthusiasm should ever
be awakened by the work yet to be

done. The real joy should come, not
from the knowledge of tasks accomp-
lished, but in the accomplishing. The
pleasure one gets from a pale review-
ing of glories attained cannot be com-
pared with that felt during the pro-
cess of attainment.

Believing this last to be true, each
one of us has untold reams of pleas-
ure before him today. a whole semes-
ter in which to be accomplishing.
Four months and a half in which to
retrieve past blunders, surpass former
achievements and pave the way for
future ones. Don't wait two or three
weeks before making up your mind
Just what response you will make to
this opportunity. Determine on this
the first day of the semester; that you

will meet each day's work as it comes. .

and meet it willingly.

 

ALL READY FOR PROM

Is that new gown all finished for
Prom? Is the man really coming?
Is everything all . set for the big
dance? Even though the winter sea-
son in Albany society was so busy
that the juniors couldn't have their
Prom on the traditional night, yet
Monday, February 5 is a much better
evening, because then we have had a
whole week-end in which to rest and
recuperate after exams. and in which
to make the final preparations for
the event. The juniors'have shown
wonderful enthusiasm, at least judg-
ing by the numbers that have signi-
fied their intention of going. The
favors are all completed, the music is

,going to be enchanting and we are all

at the peak of expectancy.

 

WE SUGGEST THAT WE—
Pay our class duos
Pay for Pail.’
Pay our debts
' In fact. pay all we owe.
Study
Do our work
Help our neighbors
Have a good time; and-—
IMPOSSIBLE!

OUR OWN'FABLE >

Once upon a time in the days of
long ago, when knights were bold and
grandfather frog lchd on the lily
pad in the puddle between‘the Great
Meadows and the Green Forest, there
were six maidens. And these six
maidens belonged to a larger group
of men and maidens that were second
in the favor of the great ruler.

There was to be a greatlestival in
the land and this grou was to have
fcasts‘and carnivals an on one parti‘
cular night they were to be allowed to
(lance long by the light of the moon.
So there was great excitement inrthc
land, and many wonderful prepara-
tions were made.

Now, one of the duties of these six
maidens was to, help carve inscriptions
on the historical tablets of the king-
(om. . .

 

 

 

 

Then one day, Just before the great
festival, he, who directed the carving
of the inscriptions, called the maidens
to him, and said, “During your‘festi-
val it will be your duty'to carve the
stories on the tablets alone. Make of
it as you choose." ‘ ' '

And there was great consternation
among the maidens because of this
res onsibilit thrust upon them. But
litt e by litt is they gathered together
the stories of the events in the king-
dom. They labored long, Working. as
they had een taught, and burning
much of the midni ht oil. ' .... ..

Finally when t ey had faithfully
finished the last of the inscribing as
they had beendirected, the Gods on
Olympus, who had perceived the labor
called the maidens unto them. And
as they looked at the tired maidens,
the] gods smiled and said, “He that

SOCIETY

I was hurt and gricVed to find that
my dear friends, the Misses Jolly
Junior Editors were in various stages
of indisposition, and I was amazed
and astounded at the noble spirit of
self-sacrifice which prompted them to
continue their splendid work on the
Junior issue.

I heard the other day that the
K A R house is suffering a temporary
absence of hot water. However, in
spite of this difficulty the inmates
plan to entertain “Shorty” Hathornc,
Ralph Baker and Hugo Polt over the

week-end.

Miss Winifred Dunn, theldushin‘g
debutant of the Co—op with light hair
has left us to teach in the Beacon
High School.

Among the costumes creating fav-
orable comment at the examination
held recently at the State College was
the dainty tWeed worn . I ‘
Carrolan, set off by the brilliantme
head-dress.

I had a unique interview with the
girls at the K A‘ house one day last
week. The library in which I was
received was charmingly decorated
with a promiscuous medley of former
examination papers, be-thumbed vol-
umes, and spectacles. Despite the
earliness of my call, I was received
by Miss Miller, Miss Bayless, Miss
Leary, and Miss Van Gelder, who had
not yet retired.

I am informed that the college
cafeteria has received a gift of a can
of salmon from Drislanc’s. The cur-
iosity of the student body has been
aroused as to just what form this
gift will take on Friday next. I have
learned also that an aged cow was
found wandering incognito amongst
the cafeteria dishes. Cow vs fish-
which shall triumph?

It is rumored that there has been
a recent influx of patients at the
Albany Hospital, due no doubt to the
execssive number of dances held at
the State College and the extremely
late hours of disbursement. I

K A R is planning to give a min-
strel show before their supply of soft
coal gives out. .

i overheard that those notables wht'I
took such an active part in Pavilion
F. have recovered and are now safely
and peacefully at large, due no doubt
to the fact; that the matron gave
them such splendid care.

AMERICANIZATION COMMITTEE

Mrs. Henry J. Sporborg has asked
State College to cooperate with the
Albany Committee on Americaniza—
tion Work in its endeavor to raise
funds to pay salaries to teachers of
foreigners unable to attend the reg
ular night-school sessions. This coop-
eration is to take the form of- buying
tickets to the Strand Theatre during
the week beginning February 5. .

The Y. W. C. A. has very kindly
offered to take charge of the matter,
and will place the tickets on sale as
the Co-op arid in the upper-halls.
These tickets will be inexpensive——
only thirty and fifty cents—Hand it
is hoped that each student will buy
at least one. i  ‘

circles of the select circles of our
most popular males, I'have learned
that the eternal masculine will‘spring

. forth in' very unique and ‘original

costumes at the Junior Prom: ‘Mr‘.
Vines will be charmingly clad as usual
with the addition of a new derby hat
and a gorgeous spotted necktie. er.
Putnam will start the precedent of
wearing black muddy rubbers and a
red bandanna autour de la neck.’ Mr.
Sherley has recently acquired a bottle
of brilliantine which is now half gone.
From this fact we deduce the conclu‘
aion that he is practicing for a spark
ling sunburst effect as to coiffure.

Mr. Lolar will be verybrilliantiy
gowned in a gorgeous white sweater
which will serve to emphasize his very
brilliant complexion. And of course
you know that Mr. Fenner will appear
in a new and striking creation. He

'will have a marcel wave, a curling

mustache and a roman striped girdle
of peacock hue.

Did you notice how very charming
the juniors looked who attended the
Junior Luncheon? It was all 'due to
the fact that they wore such. adorable
hats and long gloves.

I am informed that Miss Ruth
Draper who will'be at Chancellors
Hall, February 16, has been royally
entertained by all the nobility abroad.
