v Despite their defeat last week by
‘the Union Fresh, State’s men have
’ not lost conﬁdence and are all set for
1a great battle tomorrow——probably
:thc most brilliant gridiron all'air of
lthe season for the Capitol Hlll boys.
. With characteristic chner pessimism
‘the Purple and Gold coach states that
‘1 his protech stand little chance to de-
feat the Maroon, but still he is be-
:hind the team with all his cll‘orts and
says he will not be surprised it" his
men do turn in a victory.

A glimpse at the aftermath ol‘ last
week's all'ray shows without a doubt
that State’s football hopes are getting
better. Starting the season with a
whitewash of 84 to 0 against a team
hardly any stronger than the Union
,li‘rosh, the Purple aml Gold .ierseyed
warriors have minimized their losing
’scol'c to 26 to , which was an an N-
‘pected result ol’ the Union contest.
Practically every man on the Union
:lineup was a letter man on his high
ischool team last year and all had pre—
lvious experience. before entering col-
_ loge. State’s team is composed most-
ily of “green horns”.

Learning new plays from last

week’s battle, State’s eleven has pol-
ished up on signals and forward pass-
ing and i‘ 'eady to match wits in
ll‘oothall alnst the tricky Colgate
lteam, which has a host of plays it is
lcapable of executing. The game to—
‘morrow undoubtedly will be another
itest not only of State’s calibre, but
.01? the position of Fritz chncr
lamong the promising grid coaches of
the state. From the sidelines it will
be a game of strategy between Weg-
ncr and the Colgate mentor. Dubious
Fritz is J'oxy.
