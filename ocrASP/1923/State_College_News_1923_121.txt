LEST WE FORGET

Armistice Day! What does it mean
to you? Does it mean only another'
day of joyous hilarity, noise and cele—
bration or has it the truer conception,
of something deeper, something moreI
serious? How many times must we
be reminded of what our soldiers did
for us and how many times do wcl
forget! ‘

This Sunday the thoughts of many
countries will turn backward to the
eleventh of November, 1918, and Will
dwell on an event of international
signiﬁcance. One of the greatest tri-
butes which our nation can render to
those boys who served “Over There”
is to cause all activities to cease for
three minutes at noon on that day.
Can we not cease all personal activi-
ties for-those three minutes and ﬁll
our hearts with thoughts of country,
humanity, and universal brother-
hood?

CAMPUS DAY FIRE

Action such as Campus Day speaks
louder than any words ever spoken
about college spirit. The action
which took place last Saturday is an
example of the kind of spirit both
class and college which is prevalent
among the student body and which
had never reached the boiling over
point before. It has merely simmered
and cooled. simmered and cooled; but
it boiled over just as soon as there
was enough heat to excite its activity.
Therein lies the secret.

Each student is a match. If a few
of these matches get excited over a
“good stunt, game, or any group acti-
vity,” they ﬁre off some of the others,
who, in turn do the same to the rest
of the ignitabie mass. The result is
best illustrated by the paramount ex-
ample. Campus Day.

It is getting winter, and, since a
roaring ﬁre keeps us warmer than a
Weak smokey onc. why not keep the
"Campus Day" ﬁre piled high with
the wood of interest?

STATE COLLEGE NEWS, NOV. 9,

THAT ALL ALONE comrcsx

i.
The All Alone complex has more}

victims than it should have. There
are too many students staying homei
when they should be at college par-
ties, meetings or other social affairs,
because they do not know anyone who
is going, or they have no one to go
with. Suppose everyone felt that way
and acted according to his feelings?‘

hat a lot of money could be saved
on party clothes! '

It is quite belittling to your self
respect to confess, even to yourself
that you are so unsociable that you
cannot make friends with your class-
mates. It is more than unkind to
think that your classmates are so rude
and self centered that they will com-
pletely ignore you for a whole cvcn-
ing. No matter how you face the
problem, you are the one responsible
for your own happiness—and to be
hapy you must be sociable. Remem-
ber the “Hello” campaign!

BOOKS! BOOKS! BOOKS!
Books all colors of the rainbow!
Big books and little books with fair-
ies and goblins, books with beautiful
princesses and knights upon their
covers, all kinds of books for chil-
dren! You will see them everywhere
during this coming week, copies al-
luring enough to carry you back to
the land of your own childhood.
Pause a few minutes when in one
of the city libraries, or even make a
special visit to see the fascinating
displays especially planned through-
out the entire country for this one
week. They will not only touch the
tender places of your heart and re-
kindie your imagination, but they
may whisper Christmas suggestions
for the little brother or sister whose
character you have a part in forming.

DEAN PIERCE REVEALS TRIALS
OF WORKING COLLEGE
STUDENTS
How many students in State Col-
lege are self-supporting? In an in-

students are working their way
through College. More opportunities
of a certain kind come to Dean Pierce
an can be ﬁlled. These positions
include waiting on table, staying with
children, assisting- with house work,
cooking special dinners, serving sing-1c
meals, washing: dishes, tutoring, and
caring for furnaces.

The many calls coming in for girls
to stay with children evenings are
generally referred to the nearest stu-
dent groups. Many of these calls re—
sult in regular weekly appointments
for students.

Dean Pierce said that a survey of
the various forms of employment by
which our students earn all or a part
of their expense would be a surprise
to many. The time given to this
work represents a tremendous amount
of self denial and careful organiza-
tion of student activities in order to
carry out college work.

VACATION ADVANTAGES

What pleasant thoughts accompany
the entrance of November! “Exams,
yes, but what “billet-doux” could
spoil a perfectly glorious Thanksgiv-
ing dinner? Besides, this year there
is the anticipation of a few more
days to “visit” at home. There is
another important announcement:
take a Quarterly home. Aileen Wal-
lace, ’23, declares that the Quarterly
will be published before vacation.
She announces that there will be one
article written by a freshman in this
issue.

Classroom lectures would be made
particularly interesting in all courses
if all professors would adopt the "tell
a joke" a day rule which seems to
govern Professor Walker. Most of
the jokes are goid’nhgut the faculty.

Freshman class presidents have
much to look forward to, especially
if they are superstitious. Of late
years it has happened that the frosh
leader has either been “buster” out
in January or told to leave later in
the year. This is just a bit of en-
couragement toﬂ Willia‘in Comstock.

Quoting a once wise college pro-
fessor \vho expounded advice freely,
“it is best to ﬁrst think that you are
a freshman—u member of the stu-
dent body—heforc you give a thought
to the unhappy fact of being fresh-
man president.”

Speaking of Cii'cuses, we would
like to ask if the buying, coughing,
gurgling horses and rhinoceroscs were
practicing in Room B. at various
times last week. k

The Capitol must have made much
money last week. State's Contribu-
tion was probably the largest factor.
What would they have done without
our crowded presence?

 

1927 TO DO PRACTICE TEACH-
ING IN NEW MILNE HALL

Members of the class of 1927 will
do their practice teaching in Milne
Hall, the projected half million dollar
addition to State College, if present
plans of Dr. Brubacher and Senator
William '1‘. Byrne are materialized.
The board of trustees of the col-
lege has approved the plans of State
Architect Sullivan Jones for the pro—
posed new building to be erected on
the site between the college and the
Albany High school. Ground prob-
ably will be broken for the founda-
tion before winter and with the ap-
propriation for about $4 0 0, 0 0 0
granted by the legislature at its next
session, everything will be ready for
actual construction work to be started
in the spring.

Not only will the new building
house Milne High school, but it will
also have a large auditorium to seat
about 1,500 students. A gymnasium
for women will be located beneath

the auditorium. Laboratory s ace
for the Home Economics and Bio ogy
departments also will be provided.

CANTERBURY COMMUNION

Canterbury Club had its ﬁrst Cor-
porate Communion since college
opened, Sunday, November 4, at St.
Andrew’s church. The Reverend Mr.
Finley, the new rector of St. An-
drew's, is very much interested in
Canterbury and is aiding the Club in
many ways. The next Corporate-
Communion will be held in December.
The church has not been decided on
for this but notice will be posted and
also given through the News.

The present auditorium and gym-
naSium, according to the plans of
Dr. Brubacher, will be remodeled in-
to a library, with a gymnasium for
men on the ground ﬂoor. The pres-
ent library space will be devoted to
new class rooms.

Last year the state legislature,
after more than ﬁve years agitation
on the part of Dr. Brubacher and
other college ofﬁcials, passed a bill'
appropriating $75,00 for the prelim-
inary work on the new college struc-
ture after having purchased the prop—
erty the year before.
