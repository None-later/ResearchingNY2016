covering a period of ﬁve years.
The Total Cash Receipts, to
date, equals $26,007.60, while
the total amount pledged and
contributed is over $95,000.00.
The prospects are good. Watch
the jump in those figures.

 

PREPARATION OF THE ALL
POPULAR BEVERAGE

“Water, water everywhere and not
a drop to drink?” Well, you need
not feet that way in Albany. as the
manager of ﬁltration works explained
to us.

Professor Bronson, Professor Ken—
nedy and some members of the chem-
istry I class made a pilgrimage last
Saturday afternoon to the ﬁltration
works. Mr. ilkins, the manager,
explained the whole process of puriﬁ-
cation to us, from the use of alum
and the filtering process to the final
use of chlorine.
less than a miracle to see the dirty.
discolored water of the Hudson trans-
formed into the clear, bacteria-free
water that we drink.

STATE COLLEGE N

concerning which more diverse views!
are held in complete sincerity than;
Ecollege fraternities. Some educators, 
Efor example. regard them as_a men-[
ace without a single redeeming fea-j
tare; others see in them a blessing to l
the students under their care. 

Some students declare they have;
been of great assistance to them in
their studies and school life general-
ly; others maintain that they make
for nothing good and much that IS
hurtful in the undergraduate’s exper-
ience. Which opinion is to be ac-
cepted?

The basic idea underlying; the for-
mation of a fraternity is without
doth good, because it emphasises the

 

It seemed nothing i

essential bond of brotherhood which
(should closely unite men and natlonu.
T’l‘hat abuses in many instances have
i crept in is really aside from the ques~
ition. With a foundation of sturdy
imasom‘y, a building, though undesir-
‘ able in some respects, has always pos-
rsibilitics of usefulness, strength, and
‘ durability.

3 Taken all in all, the college frater-
‘nity has obtained too strong a hold
upon the educational systems of the
iUnited States to be regarded alto—
gether as an undesirable institution.
i’l‘hose who can look back to college
:days in which many pleasant mem-'
jories hinge around their fraternity
gatherings may possibly be too out—
;spoken in favor of what they have
‘meant them. With all due regard,
[however, for those who declare that
ithe fraternity makes for snobbish-
‘noss and class feeling, there is no
‘ gainsaying the fact that it also makes
for friendships which outlast many
,other college associations.

i NEW SOURCE OF THOUGHT i
i STIMULUS
‘ The National Student Forum ofi
New York city is' publishing a paper
called “The New Student.” This pa—
‘per is edited with the idea of helping,
the American student to really think; ‘
*to help him clear up many of the peiu
iplexing problems of life. The stu-,
,dent body of to-day is prone to take ‘
‘the formulas of life worked out by?
iothers. There are some of our num-,’
,ber who really are trying to think,;
but their number is so small in com-‘
parison with those who are continu-.
ally dodging this mental process that‘
they seem almost to stand out alone. ‘
The student mind is too apt to be-i
come ﬁlled with a dry intellectualism
which will blot out all desire or in—!
spiration to think. i
The New Student is trying to man 1
edy this evil. and it is well worth‘
the time of every college man and!
woman to read it. A copy of it is
sent to State every two weeks. This?
copy will be in the News ofﬁce where i
it will be available for use by all the E
students. ‘
Anyone having an article of inter~
est along this line can get in touch
with “The New Student” by address-i

Student, 2920 Broadway, New York.|

JOSEPH HENRY SOCIETY TO
CO«OPERATE WITH STATE
MUSEUM

 

Oliver Putnam, president of Joseph ‘
Henry society, is making arrange,
ments with New York state museum
ofﬁcials to have the club participate:
in the program which is being ar-1
ranged in memory of Professor Jo':
seph Henry who, while a professor
in the Albany Academy in 1831, in-
vented an electro-magnet by which,
he was able to transmit signals to a‘
distance. .

This was a basic discovery and one ‘
to which telegraphy and wireless is
much indebted. It is of interest that:
the bell which gave forth the ﬁrst
sound eVer heard in response to the
electro-magnet is to be rung and the
sound broadcast by WGY radio sta-
tion in Schenectady. ’l‘he Hean
memorial observance will take place
December L7.

ings for exclusive use by thi- College
