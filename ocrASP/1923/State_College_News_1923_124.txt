VCRIBBING" TO BE PUNISHABLE
, BY EXPULSION AND PUB-
; LlClTY

Expulsion and publicity are the
{weapons to be used against “crib-
ilnng’ In the future at State College.
iDr. Brubacher and the faculty are
determined to clamp the lid on the
llew of illicit knowledge, and by so
doing hope to bring about the “honor
system" at State College.

Appealing to the students as pros-
pective high school instructors, Dr.
Brubacher, in his last student assem-
bly talk impressed upon the minds of
the students the need of cultivating
honesty in examinations. In chronic
cases, expulsion will be the panacea,
he declared, whereas in less serious
cases, publicity will be used as a
means of cure.

Students caught “cribbing” and
who can give a fairly reasonable ex-
cuse will be called upon to give their
apology to the faculty and in turn it
will be read in student assembly.

 

The Newman Alumnae dance
which was to have been held
November 19 at Wolfert’s Roost
has been postponed indeﬁnitely.

RADIO SCIENCE

The Physics department refuses to
be left far behind in collegiate ad-
vaneement. The commercial depart-
ment, in oli'ering next January a
course in ofﬁce machine practice, has
made the ﬁrst step. but this is imme-
diately followed by the announce-
ment that a course in radio Will be
presented to the Physics 1 class next
semester. Professor Hale is contem-
plating the purchase of modern
equipment which not only will make
the course a more practical one. but
which will inevitably deepen the stu-
dents’ intercst in this particular phase
lof his work.

’21 SETS ROUND ROBIN
PRECEDENT AT STATE

Bound volume of '21 to be published
for one dollar

The class of ’21 has originated a
“brand-new" idea for keeping its
members in touch with each other.
A committee was appointed which
has sent out a circular letter to every
member of the class asking what he
or she has been doing since leaving
college. The letters are now coming
in to the committee, surprising them
with news that one is married,
another taking extension courses,
others telling the joys and trials of
teaching, and enclosing one dollar.
These letters are to be printed and
bound and called the “Bound Letters
of ’21." For one dollar each meni-
ber of ’21 can learn what every other
member has been doing in the past
two years. Any other students desir-
ing this interesting and useful vol-
ume can obtain one by sending a
(dollar to the committee. This idea is
entirely new to State College and it
 hoped that other classes will fol«
low the example of ’21

WIN THE LAST Kris!“
