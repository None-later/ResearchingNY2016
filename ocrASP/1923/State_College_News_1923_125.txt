LOVE NOTES

“A test either Friday or Monday!
Which shall it be?” Whercupon are
heard most terrifying groaiis, frantic‘
whisperings, and a enerai panickyl
llustration until the c ass vote decides 5
that the test will be Monday.

And then we hear wild chatter
about billet--doux. From the ﬁlibus-
tering' and the agitation we ain the
expliCit knowledge that a billtdoux
is some kind of horrifying menace
which we get via the mailbox and
which transports us immediately to
the regions of the Inferno. Its chief
aim and purpose, we gather, is to
take the joy out of living and espec—
itally out of our Thanksgiving vaca-

 

ion.

But when the smoke of excitement
blows away and our minds are re-
stored to normalcy after that awful
night-mare of cramming for mid-se-
mesters. we gradually become ration~
al again. Why, billet-doux really
means a love note. Nothing so terri-
fying in that, is there? No, we ad-
mit hesitatingly; in fact we all ra-
ther like to receive love notes—that
is, if they are nice. Well, we can’t
sincerely say that we like to receive
a billet-doux along in the latter art
of November, yet we shouldn’t a low
ourselves to become too petriﬁed over

It.

Now you see it's just a little love
note from the faculty reminding us
of their great love. If they didn’t
love us, they would be perfectly con-
tented to let us ﬂunk their courses.
Therefore, a billet-doux proves their
regard by telling us that we are on
the wrong path to glory.

So if we do happen to get a billet-
doux, let’s take it in the right spirit.
We can give our instructor a bigger
measure of hard work and concentra-
tion. It is a case of all to gain and

nothing to lose—«therefore why not
risk the hazard?

WIN THE LAST GAME!

 

STATE COLLEGE NEWS.

PLAIN FACTS

Almost every year it has been no-
cessary to preach honesty and square
dealing to the student body because
of cheating, stealing and loss of stu-
dent self res ect. he number of
cases involve varies. For the most
part the number is small, but not
small enough.

Within the last-week Dr. Brubncher
had to give a warning to the entire
student ody that cri bing in exam-
inations would be punishable by ex-
pulsion. Within the same week 9.
package of U. S. mail Was taken from
the mail box by someone other than
the owner. A bad start for a new
college year.

The News aims to give facts not
moral lessons. The above are facts
which must be dealt with. The result
of the dealing will determine the pub-
lishiiig of more facts of the same
kind. It is your publication. You
are responsible for what is printed
therein.

 

MARY KILLIP ADAMS, ’63, DIES

One of the oldest and most loyal
members of the State College Alumni
Association, Mary Kiliip Adams, ’63.
died last week at her home in Albany.
Last June, on active and interested
alumnus, she celebrated her sixtieth
anniversary by attending the alumni
convention held at the college. The
loss of so loyal ii graduate is re-
gretted by many.

 

MISS PERINE RECOVERING

SLOWLY FROM ACCIDENT

Miss Periiic, who was injured in
an accident recently, is recovering as
rapidly as possible under the circum-
stances. It has been discovered that
a bone has been cracked, and, altho
this will be slow in mending, the doc-
tor says that she will be around at
least within a month.

 

Y. W. C. A. TO SEND DELEGATES
TO INDIANAPOLIS CONVENTION

Once upon a time, away back in
1920, Y. W. C A. was probably as
eager in taking advantage of possi-
bilities for raising money as she ap-
pears to be this fall. Her problem
was the some, how to gather together
sufﬁcient funds to send delegates to
the Student Volunteer World Quad-
rcnnial Conference. Even the fact
that the expense of each delegate will
be eighty dollars will not prevent the
organization from sending at least
six representatives out to Indianap-
oils to listen to the presentation of
world problems, and discuss them
with world renowned leaders.

Y. W. C. A. has gone in for stage
settings, and dramatic eil’ect. Stami-

a fountain playing behind her, and
a blue spotlight directed at her face,
Priscilla Jones conducted a most
unique song-service Tuesday after-

suggested that less appropriate sub-

jects be chosen.

Meanwhile the distracted leader of l

the meeting, Miriam Snow, rushed
about trying to locate the speaker,
Senator Wiscwall. He ﬁnally ap-
peared, just as Miss Jones’ arm was
getting lame, and gave a very timely
and interesting talk on political par-
ties. He showed why they are neces-
sary, and why iovery voter should
afﬁliate with one or the other of the
great parties. His speech was great-
ly enjoyed, although it might not
have seemed so to an outsider. when
half the audience walked out at the
ringing of the 3:50 bell. Taken
from any angle, this Election Day
meeting was an unusual one.

Poll Si Club has doubled its mem-
bership! On Friday evening, Novem-

ded an interesting program of stunts
for the group. A brief talk, citing
the aims and purposes of the club

honorary member. After spending

cafeteria enjoying substantial refresh-
ments, the. old and new members re-
paired again to the gymnasium where

Harvey Fenncr is not being ini<

tinted. When he patrols the corri-
dors of the science building, wear-
ing a long rubber apron and drawing
an express cart loaded with bottles,
he is simply transporting apparatus
from one lab to aﬁnotlkier.

Probably if Miss Futterer could
stage one of her wonderful dramatic
acts in the State Legislature next
January she might get an increase in
salary. It is customary for the leg-
islature to spend other people’s mon-
ey for their enjoyment. It is about
time Miss Futtkere: got her slice.

Inasmuch as the Gamma Gazette
is being kept so secret, certain stu-

is anything like the Police Gazette.
That would be one good reason for
