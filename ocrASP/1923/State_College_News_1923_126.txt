MISS  oﬁfrlﬁGHTS

Tragic (Inm- c-ulu dilcuuion of
student literary lute

Broadway has its Ruth Draper. but
State College has a leading rival of
the great protean artist in Agnes
Futtcrer. After witnessing her mar-
velous dramatic ability of a week ago,
students are agreed that a compar-
able actress is yet to be found in
these parts.

It would not be fair to attempt to
put in script an appreciation of Miss
Futterer's tri-charactcr impersonation
of Keith. Larry and Wanda of John
Galsworthy’s drama. It was Miss Fut-
terer's first public appearance, so to
speak, in the student assembly and
that in itself created a condition add-
ing to the unusualness of the acting.

Probably because the selection was
not particularly appropriate to the
audience, it is the opinion of many
that Miss Futterer might be more
pleasing in lighter drama.

Miss Futterer certainly does the
teaching profession of New York
state a great honor by her presence
in its membership. Apparently the
call of the footlights has not yet ex—
tinguished the ﬂame of her devotion
to the class room. Lucky it is for
State College.

PROFESOR RISLEY SENDS
OPINION OF WORLD CRISIS

Even the broad Atlantic sometimes
seems a little stream when welcome
messages come. Professor llidiey
in freshman lecture gave a message
from Professor Rislcy who is abroad.
"Europe," says Professor Rislcy,
“must learn that the United States
will not go into another European
War. The fact must be made known
that the United States is not a reser-
voir of funds. We must abidecit
home. We must create the opinion
that theUnitcd States is not going to
enter anymore European Wars. not
only in Europe but in the United
States as well.”

STUDENTS DO PRACTICAL
SOCIAL SERVICE WORK
Margaret Cushman and Nellie Max-
im are doing practical social serVIce
work at Bloomingrove. Every on-
day night. after a community lunch-
eon, their classes assemble to be in-

 

structed in English, civics, organized
recreation, and chorus singing. " e
young teachers are talkatively onthuv
siastic about their work. >

FRESHMEN SHOW INCREASED
PHYSICAL PERFECTION :
That the funds atrributed to health .

improvement in secondary schools ac-l -

complish good results is being evi-,l
dcnced each year with each new ln‘i
coming freshman class. During the}
ﬁve years that Dr. Croasdale has been ,
with State College students she has;
perceived a decrease. in proportion to i
the size of classes, in the number of,
students whom it has been neces-;
sary to excuse from Physical Educa-i
tion. The freshman class of 1927;
has only seven of its members unable .
to take prescribed gymnasium work.{
This shows the general physical ﬁt-I
ness and vigor among the freshmen‘
coming to College.
SILVER BAY CLUB RE-ELECTS
OLD OFFICERS ,

pose of electing oﬂicers for this year.
