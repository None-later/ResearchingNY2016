RED CROSS ROLL CALL

The Red Cross, national and inter-
national, recognizes the i‘aet that in
the American collech and universi-
ties of to-day is to be found its lead-
ership for to-morrow, in a Work which
perhaps more than any other is inter-
preting to the world at large the full

' scope and meaning; of the ideal of

the Brotherhood of Man. Conse-
quently, it voices at this time an ap-
peal to the students of America, not
only for support in the oncomer
American National lied Cross liol
Cali, November 11-29, but for serious
constructive study elf the work and
methods of the organization.

Will you not, therefore, stand with
the unconuuerable will of a Sidney
iianier to the ideal of ‘
'I.‘hroup;h years of. poverty which he
could have changed by sacriﬁce of
his ideals. and through a greater

number of years of illness from tuw

berculosis which he had not the pew-
er to clump-e, the beloved poet ol.’ the
Southland strap-tried on. until with a
temrerature oi‘ 104, and while loo
wen to feed himself, he penciled his
ast and greatest poem, “Sunrise,”
afraid that he would die era the com-
pletion of his task.

 

OVER-SUNDAY SUGGESTIONS
The Library of State College is ex-
hibiting‘ a collection of new books
consisting; of late ﬁction and recent
biographies and travel. The motive
for such an exhibit is to all‘ord the
College students recreational reading;
to give them an opportunity to di-
verge a bit from the regular routine
reading: Suggestions as to what
books would be particularly enjoyed
may be given in at the Library desk.
Miss Mary Cobb and Miss Marjorie
Potter who are in charge wish to
make this project helpful to everyone.
