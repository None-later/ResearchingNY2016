“Bootlegging is no better
than lynching—in fact it is
worse. Disrespect of the eigh-
teenth amendment is threaten-
ing the supremacy of the Con-
stitution and of law. No other
attempt at nulliﬁcation in our
history has ever presented .such
a serious problem as the pres-
ent national indiil'erence to
law."
——Louis Marshall.
“Some of the plans submitted
are ludicrous, many are highly
interesting, but I think people
as a whole are tired of? once
being considered as a po itical
question.”
—Mrs. Franklin D. Roosevelt
“I would rather speak of in-
ternational ail'airs before a ga—
thering of women such as this
than I would before ten times
as many men, because I feel
that the women voters are more
interested in bringing about a
better understanding among na-
tions of the world.”
——Gcn. Allen
"I assure you, that despite
what you may hear, American
prestige is very great in Eu-
ro 0.” —Gen. Allen.
“The war which was fought
and won for democracy has gi-
ven Europe little. The rights
of small states are still preca-
rious, new states are perpetrat‘
ing the wrongs of the great
empires, and through Eastern
and Southern Europe dictators
dominate.”

STATE FOUGHT LAST
GAME WITH SPECTAC-
ULAR METHODS
Score 7—0

The ﬁnal football game of the sea-
son was Won last Saturday by the
R P. I. freshmen with a score of
’7~-»0. It was one of the ﬁnest played
games of the season, showing State’s
men at their best. Going into the
game with determination, our men
fought. When R. P. I. made their
touch-down, they could thank State,
for it was a neat picture, indeed. of
a Hercules standing a husky on his
head just over the line. Then what
excitement ran through the crowd as
the ball came a few inches of our
goal. Lost—yes. on downs, but it
was a game not to have been missed.

MESSAGE FOR THANKSGIVING DAY

W ASH/NCTON, Nov, 6.--Prcsidenl Coolidge lo issued a proclamation
selling aside Thursday, November 29. (13 Thanksgiving day. I! reads:

lﬁrnrlamaﬁnn

'l‘he American people, from their
earliest days, have observed the wise
custom of acknowledging each year
the bounty with which Divine provi-
dence has favored them, In the be-
ginning, this acknowledgement was a
voluntary return of thanks by the
community for the fruitl‘ulness of
the harvest. 'I‘hough our mode of
life has greatly changed, this custom
has always survived. It has made
'l‘hanksgiving day not only one of the
oldest but one of the most character-
istic observances of our country. On
that day. in home and church, in
family and in public gatherings the
whole nation has for generations paid
the tribute due from grateful hearts
for blessings bestowed.

To center our thoughts in this way
upon the favors which we have been
shown has been altogether wise and
desirable. It has given opportunity
justly to balance the good and the
evil which we have experienced. In
that we have never failed to ﬁnd
reasons for being grateful to God for"
a generous preponderance of the
good. Even in the least propitious
times a broad contemplation of our
whole position has never failed to
disclose overwhelming reasons for
thankfulncss. ’l‘hus reviewing our
situation, we have found war am for
a more hopeful and conﬁdent attitude
toward the future.

In the current year, we now ap-
proach the time which has'becn ac-
cepted by custom as most ﬁtting for
the calm survey of our estate and
return of thanks. We shall the more
keenly realize our good fortune if we
will, in deep sincerity, give to it due
thought, and more especially, if we
will compare it with that of any other
community in the world.

The year has brought to our people
two tragic experiences which have,
deeply all'ected. One was the death
of our beloved President Harding,
which has been mourned wherever
there is a realization of the worth of
high ideals. noble purpose and un-

TO W0 K FOR ‘
WORLD PEACE}

'I‘he Citizenship School conducted
last week at'the college emphasized
the country’s serious need of law-
abiding, peace promoting people, and:
stressed the fact that the intelligent!
women voters of the country are the
ones to promote harmonious condi-
tions at home and abroad.

ajor General Henry '1‘. Allen,
commander of the last American
forces on the Rhine, declared that
the United States has a right to a
voice in European affairs and should
exercise that right. He pointed out
that the League of Women Votersi
could do a tremendous amount of
good by slipping the minds of the:
voters to the necessity of interest; in;
foreign affairs. ‘

selﬁsh service carried even to the end
of supreme sacriﬁce. His loss recalled
the nation to a less captious and more
charitable attitude. It sobeer the
whole thought of the country.

little later came the unparalleled
disaster to the friendly people of Ja-
pan. ’l'his called forth from the peo-
ple of the United States a demonstra-
tion of deep and humane feeling. It
was wrought into the substance of
good works. It created new evidence
of our international friendship. which
is a guarantee of world peace. It
replenished the charitable impulse of
the country.

By experiences such as these, men
and nations are tested and reﬁned.
We have been blessed with much of
material prosperity.

We shall be better able to appre-
ciatc it if we remember the priva-
tions others have sull'crcd, and we
shall he the more worthy of it if we
use it for their relief. We will do
well then to render thanks for the
good that has come to us. and show
by our actions that we have become
stronger, wiser and truer by the
chastenings which have been imposed
upon us. e will thus prepare our-
selves for the part we must take in
a world which forever needs the full
measure of service, We have been a
most favored people. We ought to
be a most generous people. We have
been a most blessed people. We
ought to be a most thankful people.

Wherefore, I, Calvin Coolidge,
President of the United States, do
hereby ﬁx and designate Thursday,
the twenty-ninth day of November,
as ’l‘hanksgiving day. and recom-
mend its general observance through-
out the land. It is urged that the
people gathering in their homes and
their usual places of worship give ex-
pression to their gratitude for the
beneﬁts and blessings that a gracious
providence has bestowed upon them,
and seek the guidance of Almighty
God that they may deserve a contin-
uance of His favor.

BASKETBALL SEASON
T0 OPEN WITH 6000
WINNING PROSPECTS

Au’t Conch Fit—Egon“ to Train Man

FIRST GAME WITH UNION

Overlapping of the football season
with the basketball practice sessions
is working hardships on Assistant
Coach Stanley Fitzgerald in the for-
mation of a team for the opening
game of the court season December
is with Union college.

Vacation next week also will have
considerable cll‘ect upon the team,
since the men will not be properly
groomed for the initial battle. “Big
Fitz" has been working with a few
candidates for the varsity the lastch
weeks and early this week the other
aspirants answered the call.

A ﬁrst glance at the material gives
promise of a fairly formidable quin-
tet this year at State, inasmuch as
several of the new men have had pre~
vious experience tossing the sphere.
State’s one big need has been ﬁlled;
that is in the center position, which
was the weakest link of last year’s
combination.

Captain Juckctt. the "ﬂying
guard,” is back after his choice berth
and there is a host of new material
from which Coach Fitzgerald can se-
lect a companion for “Juck.” “Mar-
cus” Daley looms as a probable choice
for one of the forward positions, or,
in an emergency. he can readin qua-
lify for a guard. Former Captain
Sherley will probably make a bid for
forward. .

A line on the new men will not be
possible until after another week of
training. It is understood Coach Fitz-
gerald, who is a former State College
star, having- been a member of the
famous Fitzgerald~Barry combination
in the days before the war, when a
basketball team was a' basketball
team at State, will introduce a new
style of play this year and will at-
tempt to perfect the ﬁve-man defense,
which is the secret of success.

Coach chner will undoubtedly
take an active part in the basketball
coaching, but the development of the
team will be left chieﬂy up to “Big
Fitz," since he is a more experienced
basketball man.

EMPLOYMENT BLANKS TO
BE CHANGED

15,000 New Blanks Ordered

As a result of a suggestion made
by Edward Vines of the senior class,
the question relating to religious be:
lief has been ordered stricken from
the college employment bureau’s
questionnaires. The business ofﬁce
has placed an order for 15,000 new

lanks.

Dr. Brubae‘hcr’s attention was
brought to this matter by Mr. Vines,
who declared that the Catholic stu-
dents would‘ refuse to answer the
question. Mr. Vines pointed out that
the state education law prohibits
school superintendents or boards of
education from discriminating against
teachers because of religious belief.
