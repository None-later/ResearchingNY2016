DO WE WANT HONOR

Do we want an honor system or
not? The question was suddenly
placed before the student body last
Friday. With the exception of a few
students who did not vote, the entire
assembly was in favor of petitioning
the Faculty for permission to institute
the honor system here at State Col-
lege.

Last year there was a two weeks’
open discussion of the honor system.
Student opinion favored it. but
nothing deﬁnite was decided. This
year cheating has become a serious
oﬂ'ense punishable by expulsion. We
feel that it is time to make a deﬁnite
decision; either we uphold honor, or
we are content to wink at cheating;
either we prize our own honor an
that of our Alma Mater. or we ques-
tion both.

The student body in deciding this
question decides the standard of th
college in the educational world; it
decides the character of the majority
of its members; it decides the ideals
of to-day for ourselves and the ideals
of tomorrow, for those whom we
inﬂuence by contact. .

and nearer approaches
Are we thankful? We
The whole student body is
thankful for the extended vacation,
but let us hear for what our profes-
sors are so thanks-given.
' Echoing every one’s shouted desire
is this: “I'm thankful I can go home"
quoted Miss Thomson of Home Eco-
nomics department.

“Money, money! That is what I
am thankful for!" from Miss Tal-
madgc.

Professor Kirtland is thankful that
he regards the closing of the hunting
season so patiently. He probably dis-
likes to kill his own turkey.

Dr. Thompson is thankful for the
appropriation for MUSIC Association.

“If the Residence Hall Fund is
slowly growing. I am very thankful,"
stated Dean Pierce.

tion shown among the students.’ was
Dr. Croasdaie’s cheerful response.

Dean Metzler climaxes the Thanks-
giving thankt’nlnesses by: “As far as
State College is concerned I am
thankful of the opportunity to be of
service."

And we are thankful that they are
thankful and that there are so many
ﬁne things in the world for which to
be thankful.

 

THE DEAN'S VIEW OF THE
HONOR SYSTEM

“An honor system must come
from within rather than from
without. No matter what pres-
sure is brought to bear an hon-
or system cannot be a success
unless most pupils are honor«
able. No punishment. public or
private. will necessarily make a
student honorable. he himself
must desire to be so. State
College is no worse than other
colleges, and I suspect it is a
good deal better than most, but
there is always room for im-
provement."

——-Dcan Metzler.

 

 

 

THREE-FOLD PURPOSE OF
RUMMAGE SALE

Suggestions For Disposing of
Useless Clothes

A rummage sale is to be the next
venture of Y. W. to serve the triple
purpose of helping students dispose
of old clothes. of assisting some poor
families in the districts along the
i river front, and of increasing the In-
|dianapolis fund. While folks are un-
ijoying the Thanksgiving festivities,
ithcy might hunt up something out-
igrown or “outstyled.” and ship it to
EM. F. Benjamin. 186 Western Ave.,
'Albany. A small concrete expression
of thankfulness will give a better rel-
ish to every Thanksgiving dinner.

Y. W. FRESHMEN REFLECT
COLLEGE INTEREST

Oh. that thankful feeling which is
intensiﬁed with the aproaching vaca‘
tion! Ono realizes its strength at the
Y House, where ﬁfteen freshmen
ever since College opened have been
carrying around with them. and con-
sulting with increasing frequency the
precious time-table which will direct
their ﬁrst Journey home. Perhaps the
upperclassmcn are not so lacking in
hilarity as they appear to be. A
search under the pillows of scveml of
them might disclose lac-numbered fol-
ders similar to those the fresh have
so long cherished.

Thanksgiving Recess

"Wurzel Flummcry” will be one of
the three plays to be given by the
Dramatics class late in January. This
is a comedy written by A. A. Milne,
a protege of James M. Barrie. The
second play will probably be the
“Thrice Promised Bride" by Hshung.
Hshung is a Chinese student working
his way through Cornell. His plays
have just been accepted, aml this play
has already been given by the Cor-
ncii Dramatic society. The third play
has not yet been decided upon. The
tryouts for these plays will be held
immediately after the Thanksgiving

vacation.

WHITING CONCERT
DELIGHTS WITH
OUAINT MELODIES

The delicate charm of the harpsi-
chord cast its spoil over a gathering
in Chancellor’s hall a week ago when
Arthur Whiting introduch his audi-
tors to an instrument that is strange
to the present generation. The occa-
sion was the ﬁrst of a series of con-
certs under the direction of the State
College Music Association.

George Barrera, perhaps the fore-
most ilutist alive today, wove a fasci-
nating theme with his artistry in
Gluck’s airs and dances from “Ar-
mide,” “Iphigenic en Aulidc" and
“Orfeo.” In combination with Mr.
Whiting at the harpsichord. a restful
charm and grace resulted as the soft
thin notes of the flute made the mas-
terly accomplishment complete.

Miss Lorraine Wyman, with her
pleasant soprano voice and attractch
personality. gave an added touch of
charm to the program with her rol-
licking folk songs. A new and strange
arrangement was the combination of
her voice and the harpsichord. The
audience was most enthusiastic in its
reception of the artists’ eii‘orts.

Miss Sherman proceeds to do so. .

When doctors disagree. who shall
decide? When the learned members
of the faculty disagree both may be
wrong. To quote Professor Bronson.
“The next war will be one of chem-
istry.” “No,” contradicts Professmv
Woodard, “The next war will be be-
tween man and insects.” _

(We reserve our opinion to see
who wins.)

It’s a good thing there isn’t a coal
shortage this winter, for certain sor-
ority and fraternity houses would be
in a bad ﬁx, inasmuch as they have-
n’t much furniture to*burn.

Students who “hickod” from dis-
tant states to attend the resident
Workers’ College at Katonah. N. Y.,
have nothing on K. D. R. men. 01'

By the musical sounds which have
been coming from room B for the last
week. one might be led to suspect
that the sophomores are going to
take up concert work! They aren’t!
They have only been practicing for
the class sing ip aséserrLbly to—day.

Everybody knows everything, says
Professor Woodard, until—they have
an examination.
