A terrible catastrophe happened
last week when each and every one
of us, the juniors on the News board,
was stricken with some malady.
Some of us took to our beds and
wrote copy; some of us plodded pain-
fully up to the college and dug up
copy. Several times several of us
gathered together and, in spite of our
various aches and miseries compiled

the paper. We did our best to be
funny, to do justice, to refrain from
slamlng. We assure you that our
intentions were the best (intentions
alwaysgare.)

e print this picture, a bit ideal-
ized, of ourselves, in the hopes that
we may invoke a wee bit of sympathy
and understanding. Even if you can

 
 
 
    
  

not sympathize, please, please under-
stam .

and unruly nerves, we stop for a
moment and ask you to think kindly
of us, for there shall be only this
one Junior issue of the Class of '24.
Most respectfully to all.- .
The Junior Editors.

strange creatures known as bug's.
Beyond the fact that their were both
juniors, their identity wil forever be
shrouded in mystery. The next per-
formance was a pierrette dance by
Orena Relyea, draped in sheets. It
was most effective. Then did Flor-

keep from being happy when they
saw the carefree way in which she

It was not generally known until
that night just what an accomplished
actress the college harbored in the
person of Mary Maher. She sang,

her 'vaudeville performance. After
repeated encores she was obliged to
stop for want of breath. , ,

The climax of the ceremonies was
Miss Smith’s eulogy on the corpse.
It was very, very touching and hum;
orous. ‘ - ‘

To dispel the gloom of this scene,
Muriel Dageett and her troup gave a
skit entitled the "Follies." '

Ice cream and social dancing were
greatly in evidence until eleven thirty
when the tired but happy mourners
wandered to their lockers and thence

homeward.
