HISTORY TEACHERS TO
HOLD ROUND TABLE
CONFERENCE IN
ALBANY

This year the Historical and Art
building" will be the center of many
discussions, for it will be there that
the history teachers will gather to
consider the topics of the day. The
council of this Round Table, of which
Mr. Hidley is in charge, submitted
several plans for the conducting of
these meetings and ﬁnally decided to
leave it all to open discussion. In
this way they hope to interest every
person who attends and cover more
material than might be employed in
the discussion of certain set ques-
tions and topics.
