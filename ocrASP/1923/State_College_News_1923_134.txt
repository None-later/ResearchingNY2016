light of this, what [ am going to pro-
pose should not seem so radical. 1
propose that the students, in a body,
pass on the following resolution. This
done, the question of honor would be
settled.

Resolved: That, since we are stu-
dents of the New York State College
for ’l‘eaehers, and as such the future
instructors of the children of this ria-
tion;

And since we shall largely influence
the formation of the character of
those children;

And since these children are to be
the future citizens of this nation, on
whose cha'zictcr its welfare will dc~
pcni ,

'l‘hat we‘, now, realizing the magni~
tude of our obligations, do solemnly
promise to consider it a matter of
personal honor, to report cheating at
an examination. since in this mount-r
we may protect the future ol. our
country.

i liiay add bore that i hardly be—
liovc ii large body of students can
so quickly change, or 'uthcr, eradi-
cate an inhibition that is so common,
and has been, for innumerable ages,
and therefore. i doubt that every
student would honestly and whole
hcartodly pass on the above l‘t'solu-
Lion.

Duty to Future Citizens
Dear Editor,

The discussion in Assembly last
Friday showed plainly that the chief
objection to the honor system was
the question of honor. paradoxical as
that may seem. In short, the major-
ity of students believe they are coin—
mitting a dishono'ablc act in report-
ing a fellow student who has cheated
in an exam. The proponents of the
honor system will immediately sin
that the student, in so doing, is up
holding the honor of the school and
the teaching profession. This is true.
but they must take into consideration
the fact that the average imlividual’s
conception of honor is not broad
enough, or deep enough, to include
this application. Honor, as the ma-
jority understand it, is an unwritten
law, not to be found in any code of
statutes, but often conflicting with
some of these statutes. Our written
laws say that if one man sees another
breaking a law, he must report him.
or he is himself deemed liable to pro«
sccution. But how does this work
out in practice? A man may report
his neighbor for murdering someone,
but he will hesitate to do so if he
knows his neighbor is making home-
brew. Still, the underlying principle
is the same!

Before the honor system can be
expected to meet with the unreservcu
approval of the whole student body,
the question of honor In reporting a
fellow student for cheating must be
settled. Here is the only way I can
see to do it! The students of State
College intend to become teachers.
'l‘his presupposes that their ethical
standards are on a much higher plane
than those of the layman. In the

 

,-ples at all times.
’ncvur cheated and never expect to do

htant to my mind than that of report«

our college to emulate these princi-
l’ri'sonully, l have

so. but tlu is no thought more dis-

 

ing another student here. Honor
must be in the heart of every student
before we can reach the point of rea
honor. i think that or 'y one should
take upon himself the pledge of lion-
or to his college, his teachers, his l'c
low students, and to himself—hut to
say that we will report those around

   

 

dishonest, is belittling honor; it is
making it a petty thing, unworthy of
the name. What is college? is it
this red brick building! 0. College
lilo is made up of the l'rici’idsliips, tho
happy memories, the pleasant experi-
ences, and the associations connected
with State College. We are all broth-
ers and sisters hero, under our Col-
lege Mother, and if a feeling of loy-
alty and fellowship is not with us this
college is an empty plac . Let us try
to be honorable; let us over LU
help others to be honorable, but lei.
pledge to ourselves that we will
_ o’r entertain the idea of "report-

Fear, Loyalty. and Honor

A lock is a useful thin r; so is a
fences—dint let us keep locks and fen~
ces for beasts. Pro: is depen-
dent on the moral advance of each
individual in his generation. And
the man who can see the right but
shrinks is of no benefit to humanity.
Self-interrogation and the intcr~
pretation of our natures is valuable
and necessary. We are confronted
with a question. A proposal is made;
we ask these questions: Do I doubt
my oivn or my neighbors honesty?
We are unworthy to teach and be
examples unto those we teach it we
cannot trust our honor and that of
our fellow men enough to subject
them to our fellows’ scrutiny. Do We
college students look upon professors
as guardians of our actions, to con-
trol the Ioathesomc tendencies of our
flesh, we who presume to pass judg~

ment on weighty decisions?

E Our infantile cups do not lit us.
‘We must face life and meet it and
grapple with it. 0 must cleanse
ourselves and help others to cleanse
the evil from them~cvcn if the talk
is unpleasant.

Present systems have not bred lion-
or among us. “'l‘ho Honor System”
will create honor for our institution
as it has for other colleges, Which
illlllll, considers, Values, guards his
country bestrubo who can help make
and carry out her laws or he who is

bad no voice? We no longer wor-
ship kings and blindly love monar-
chii-s Education has brought us pri-
v egos and duty to control these
circuiii ances which affect us and our
children’s children.

Personal comfort when it is gained
by conscious igno‘ancc of duty is
loathnsomo. In anyone it spells dum-
niition and it' it spreads the infection
will bring disaster to the mass.

To what standards do you attach
your loyalty? if you consciously up»
hold wrong iiavri you any worth to
humanity? if you have no God, con~
sidor then His people and live your
best for them unshrinkingly. A per-
son likes the sweetness of poison—re
will you let him drink the cup of it?

l' Stali- College will not uphold an
honoi in, State College is ’ully-
ing hr-r honor and taking a buck-
ward stop in promoting the growth
of the spirit of honor in this student
bod,’ and is hindering world progress.

Shades of Judas!

We are now facing the question of
whether or not We want the honor
system, ’l‘he honor system means
that not only arr- siudcnts rcqucsleu
to divulge the names of their fl‘llOWs
who crib but are compelled to do so
under pain of expulsion. Without
this provision, we are told, the S3»
tom is a failure. The mere request is
an insult to the very thing after which
the system is niisiniiiicd, but to put a
[student on his honor to l'UIiol'L
another gives him a choice of two
liiishonors: lii't, that of br-uking his
I‘ pledge to the system, and second, that
l
,

 

'ol' suiieiilin 1'. .-\nd this is what they
call an honor system.
Judas and Benedict Arnold! it's bad
enouin to crib but it's worse to
squeal, and two wrongs do not make
ii right. In our Opil‘lll the scheme is
not complete. Provision should be
made for paying the informer the

ty pieces of silver tradition in.»
titles him to.

What is the reason for the intro—
duction of the honor system into
State College? Some one evidently
was shocked by the fact that publicity
was to be used as a weapon against
cribbers so they dug up the honor
. . m to keep the dishonest ones in
the straight and narrow. This is a
ﬁne thing for the crooks in the col-
lege, but the trouble is that it makes
stool-pigeons out of the rest of us.
Does the end justify the means?
Why not let our slcight—of—hand ur-
tists take their publicity? Why wor<
ry over the problems of the faculty,
especially since they seem to be able
to solve them better than we, any-
how?

But if we must have an honor sys~
tent, let’s have a real one. The law
against copying your neighbor’s paper
and using aids to memory other than
those taught by correspondence
schools isn’t the only rule that is
at State. Why not let the
system cover every college ruling?
For instance, if a man sees another
smoking ii. cigarette in the locker~
room. let him run and tell the coach
ior if a girl goes out on a date and
