NDIDATES“

Man vs. Woman The Biggest Issue

Presidential guns are booming at
State College. Already organization
candidates ' re being groomed for the
chief magistracy ol‘ the student as
sociation, although election day is scv~
cral months all". Next your premises
to witness the most spirited cam-
paigns si co the inception of the stu-
dent association in 1921.

Independent aspirants for the high-
est post will be a feature of the elec-
tion, it is predicted. The wide dis-
cussion ol' the honor system is de-
clared to be giving some students
hitherto in the backﬁeld an opporv
tunity to plunge into the limelight
and make it interesting for the regu—
lars.

Dame Rumor has it that a certain
group of women students is planning,
to keep the power of the student as-
sociation and will come forward soon
with a strong candidate for nomina-
tion next May. The men, however,
deeming it about time one of their
lot was elected president, are mak—
ing preparations for an active cam-
paign.

The “political” wiseacrcs will close—
ly watch the debate on the honor sys—
tem after Christmas vacation with the
hope of ﬁnding some logical possibil-
ity for president of next year’s asso—
ciation as well as give the sopho-
mores the 0nce«over for a strong Vice-
n'esidential nominee.

 

The Residence Hall Secre-
tary, Miss Talmadgc, would ap—
preciate it if any group, know-
ing of corrections in addresses
or marriage of any of the alum-
ni, would report it to her.

MERRY CHRISTMA.

i Barl‘ling passwork and general su-
periority in all departments of the
game netted Union college an easy
victory over State last Saturday night
[in the (larnet’s initial basketball con-
,test ol‘ the season. The final score
iwas 31, to I'» and probably would have
iln-cn greater it‘ the Union coach did
,not) give his second string; men a
1chance to play.

The whole oil'ense and defense of
lState was weak, probably as the re-
sult ol.’ the battering meted out by
,Cooper Union the night previous. It
it had not been for a lucky shot by
Daley, State would have gone down
.in sore dcl'cat without a ﬁeld goal,
iwhlile the Garnet scored almost at

Y. W. C. A. BAZAAR FOUND
MOST SUCCESSFUL

College Christmas Presents
A l Purchased

The Y. W. C. A. Christmas bazaar,
December 7. was a great success,
both financially and otherwise. For
this the President gives much credit
to Iva Hinman, who was General
Chairman. The most successful table
was the Alumni table, and the Asso-
ciation wishes to thank the interested
alumni for making it so. The articles
sold at the bazaar included home
made candy, Japanese articles, plants,
and cut ﬂowers, handkerchiefs, and
other fancy articles, things from the
Co-op, as well as i« cream and soft
drinks. .

The supper in the cafeteria, of
which the outstanding feature of the
meal seemed to be the apple pie a la
mode, ten cents extra. was in charge
of Jacquelyn Monroe.
