STATE COLLEGE NEWS,

clate quite so keenly what it means
to be back again) with "That 01(
G n Mine”, and to celebrate with
them the jolliest Chrlstmus ever! A1-
ready we are so imbued with antici-
pation that we just have to bubble
over at times.

But lest we forget: let's do our
best to stick to the wheel for just a
few days more, then We really can
istep out. Our professors aren’t let-
lting down many jots in their assign-
'ments and it is for us to measure up.
lThcrcfore, we are going to be game
land by our unflinching work wish
our faculty a “Merry Christmas."

To the Editor of the News:
Athletics are getting to be a joke
at State College not only at the col-
Ilcge itself, but more particularly out—
side among the general sporting pub-
lic of the vicinity. ’l‘his does not
mean from a financial standpoint, for
thousands of dollars are spent each

year by the students to support
teams.
Look at our basketball schedule

and you will see the real meaning of
the statement. It is the fault of those
persons who formulate the while.

EDEAN PIERCE ESEIRRETES
THE MODERN

“Most that is written and said now-
a-days regarding the modern girl does
her injustice. Considered as a whole
the modern girl is not bad, in fact,
she has ﬁne ambitions and ideals, but
she is sometimes trying to express her
new independence in bad wuys,” says
Dean Pierce. Perhaps she does not
dill'er so much from the old-fashioned
girl, except that she is more uncon-
ventional, sometimes adopting dues-
tionablc manners. language, aml ac-
tions. Smoking, drinking, and swear-
ing are indulged in by relatively .fcw
girls, so few that were it not for the
fact that these few are thought by
the rest to represent a type of girl«
hood which should be patterned after,
they might be entirely ignored. Such
habits take away something line aml
charming from the woman. "hey
constitute. however, an ethical ques«
tion as applicable to men as to we-
men. “l would that men smoked less,
our girls not at all,” stalcd our Dean.
Perhaps the modern girl is a product
of the age. The new freedom for
women in politics and business do of
a nee ssity take them out into tin-
world and tend to place them on an
equal footing with men. The in-
crease in smoking-among young men
with a decrease in the warfare
,ugainst it, and the tendency among
linlluential business women to think
iit smart to smoke and drink are also
"Iargely responsible for the young
:girl's behavior. in thinking and talk-
,ing about the matter. the emphas"
ishould be positive rather than no}:
' We should stop talking about
the unfortunate attempts to express
indupumlence in lower forms and
istross really worthwhile
‘and accomplishments.

Students do not want to pay out
$1500 a year to see their basketball
team lose the majority, if not all. of
its games. State College of today is
not the State College of pro-war days
as far as basketball is concerned.
Therefore, it is ridiculous for our
team to play such colleges as Union,
Colgate, St. Lawrence, or Cooper-
Union until we can present a team
that is worthy of such opposition.

Why is it our basketball managers
failed to include Geneseo Normal
school—the only team State beat last
year—in this year's schedule? Why
is it that the whole schedule for this
season is out of our class? Is it be—
cause the managers are incapable in
that they lack judgment, or is it be—
cause they are downright careless
and disregardful for State’s position
in sportdom? Present circumstances
lead us offhand to believe the ﬁrst.

State College must conﬁne itself to
playing the teams of colleges and
schools in its class. if it wants to rc~
gain the respect and patronage of
the general public. Victory is the
