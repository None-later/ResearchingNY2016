The part of the \Vrigley Build-
ing erected two years ago has tilled
such a want that the north section,
nearly double the ﬂoor area of the
south section, is being added.

This north section, nearly com-
pleted, occupies the entire block,
immediately across North \Vater
Street, fronting on Michigan
Avenue and reaching to the height
of the main part of the ﬁrst struc-
ture. with a connecting bridge.

The space in the new section ‘is
already nearly all taken by high—
class firms in advance of the com-
pletion of the building.

Here is a concrete (as well as a
steel and glass) proof of the say—
ing that “advertisia‘g pays." In
these magniﬁcent buildings Mr.
Wrigley has erected an impressive
testimonial to this great truth.
They loom large and beautiful.
They typify the achievements of
the man who built them. They
stand as a monitor over the activ-
ity of the Nation's second city—-
inspiring—(lomihating—massive—
bearing unanswerablc testimony
to the POWER OF ADVER-
TISING.
