placed Sherley at guard. Hornung
went to center. and Galnor came'out.
After these substitutions the Purple

and Gold quintet let loose an attack w

that bail’led their opponents. The
visitors were overwhelmed to the
stellar pass work of State. The
five point lead of Geneseo was over-
come as Caton registered once and
Breslau twice from the ﬁeld. State
then let up long enough to allow Un-
derwood to get thru and tally from
the ﬁeld. Again the Purple and Gold
tightened up. and Hornung and Cato:-
both scored from the field. The first
half ended with State leading 18-15.

At the opening of the second period
Hornung caged two shots from the
ﬁfteen foot line increasing State’s
lead. The home team kept this advan-
tugc and were never headed during
the entire half. Captain Sherley
broke thru the defense and scored
from the ﬁeld.

The visitors, becoming alarmed at
the progress of the purple and Gold
quintet, flashed into life in an attempt
to overcome the seven point lead held
by their opponents. Vento and Welcn
dropped ,in the ball from the ﬁeld.
Hornung tallied another foul shot,
and after a few minutes L. Costello
duplicated this. Hornung again
scored from the complimentary line.
Howe ended the scoring for State
when he caged a long shot from mid
court. Geneseo made a vain attempt
to overcome their opponent's lead.
Underwood and Welch came thru
and tallied ﬁeld goals, but the final
gun was’iired with State holding a
two point lead. The ﬁnal score
was 26-24.

This was the best game seen on the
home court this season. The out-
standing feature of the game was
the superb work of Juckett laying
left guard for State. His efense
broke up many of the visitorsplays
underneath the basket and prevented

them from tallying .the. deciding
points. Caton, Homung and Breslau
also starred. Uuderwood and Welch
excelled for the visitors.

ample set them by the seniors, should
begin to determine just how they. as
a class and as individuals, intend to
increase the dormitory fund. The
clubs and sororities should follow out
and enlarge upon their plans of last
emester whereby the “ gate receipts “
from various social functions were
used to swell the fund. Even the
freshmen should by this time, have
become so familiar with and enthu-
siastic over, the project that their
greatest desire should be to see it
carried through. ;
The total pledges and cash to date
amount to $81. 891.64. Nineteen and
ﬁve-tenths per cent of the Albany
County members have responded, and
thirty-four and seven-tenths per cent
of the Albany City. We. who can
stitute the active members of the stu-
dent body, should be far more keenly
alive to the need for a dormitory than
anyone else; Our percentage response
should be a hundred per cent one.
Remember. every bit helps. Report

may be kept of them. and that they
