Ruth Draper interviewed

To Give Monologue Hero Fob-
ruory 16

Because she has created a new genre
of monologues,

"The London Times" called. her

the “most accomplished of livmg

reciters,”

her original character sketches

range from the charwoman to the

debutante,

she sets her stage, builds her scen-

ery and draws her characters in

the imagination. of the audience
there are so few original people
in the world.

Ruth Draper, in a Russian kind of
blouse, her dark hair drawn into a
simple knot at the back, her black
eyes vibrant, sat on a low couch, tell-
ing Young Boswell of her early inter—
est in monologues. Here was the
woman who could change herself into
any one of a hundred people, not by
magic, as most children think, but
simply by standing on a bare stage
and talking. That is her particular
genius.

Ruth Draper—~The monologue is a
development of the average child’s
ability to dramatize the scenes of its
own life. My brother and I used to
do them, and so do most childern.

Young Boswell—Most people lose
that childlike quality when they grow
up, unfortunately. I think it ought
to be developed in children so they
won't lose it.

Ruth Draper—l don’t think it can
be taught or developed. It's a ter-
ribly personal sort of gift that some
people just have. its the child’s
quality to sink itself in what it is do-
ing. 1 live my characters so intensly
and respect them so much that they
become real to me. I think Debor-
au's speech to his son expresses what
I mean. He tells his son that in the
art of acting if you think hard enough
of the person you are trying to per-
tray you are that person. It is in-
tensive thinking. The thought con-
ception of the character is so clear
and the feeling of the setting is so
strong that the voice, the gestures and

GIRLS OF PSI GAMMA
SORORITY OBSERVE
25th ANNIVERSARY

When old State College had its
building in Willett street, there were,
among the students two progressive
young Albanians interested in form-
mg a literary society. They were
ldith Stonoman of First street and
Gertrude l-lall oi" Washington avenue.
'l‘hcy sought out the late Dr. William
J. Milne and, with his counsel and
consent, gathered together nine other
students and in February, 1898, or—
ganized the Psi Gamma sorority, the
twunty—t‘il‘th anniversary of which was
celebrated in Albany Friday and Sat-
urdny.

in Elizabeth Reed, a Cornell gradu-
ate. taking a post graduate course at
college, was elected the first presi-
dent. Mrs. Margaret S. Mooney,
head of the English department, was
asked to act as faculty adviser.

’l‘he sorority at once took its place
as on important factor in the life of
ilho college, expanding until its mem-
bers numbered eighteen by June,
H498. Weekly meetings were con-
ducted in the homes of the girls or
in the old Primary chapel. The first
large social function of the year was
a reception given to the faculty and.
the student body in June.

As the members were graduated
each year, it was found that there was
a continued desire to gather when sev-
eral were located near each other and
thus gradually an Alumnae associa-
tion came into existence. The chief
meeting of each year was the dinner
at the Bl‘eslin hotel in New York
when ofﬁcers were elected.

in April, 1922, at a meeting follow-
ing the annual dinner of the active
chapter at the Hampton Hotel, a gen-
eral Psi Gamma Alumnae association
was organized by the alumnae. The
New York group forms an important
branch of this organization. The fol-
lowing officers wore elected: Presi-
dent, Mrs. Olive Homing Mchrmott.
’17, Albany: Vice president, Winifred
Wemple, ’19, Schenectady; secretary-
treasurer. Ruth Heminover, ’22,
Garnerville: assistant secretary, Betty
Macmillan. ’08, Schenectady; reporter
Minnie B. Scotland, ’13, Cohoes.

The anniversary festivities in
Alhanv included theatre parties, in-
formal get—together Socials, a lunch-
eon at the Hampton hotel and a
dinner at the State college when the
chests joined the'Eastern New York
branch of State College alumni. Mrs.
Edith Stoncman Duroe, a charter
member, now of Brooklyn, was toast—

Juniors Promenade at Ten Eyck

the Ten Eyck ball room, the juniors
proms, and they made for themselves
What a
fantastic to the strains of Simon’s

The music was par excellence and absolutely irresistible, and
then as the wee small hours of the morning were dawning the orchestra
nhnnduned strings and horns and jauntily exercised their vocal chords.

Immediately tired feet scarcely touch-
ed the floor in their enthusiastic
response and spirits that perhaps had
become slightly exhausted, were re»
stored on the spot and el'l’ervesced
with more hilarity than ever. The
only desire of all the merry crowd

was “would that all the years were _

dancing holidays” but “the bird of
time has but a little way to flutter,
and the bird is on the wing " and then
finally the bird ceased fluttering as
it endeavored to comprehend the
inevitable meaning of “Home Sweet
Home.” What could be more lie-iri-
rending than the finale of a brilliant
social success'l.

Much praise for the excellent man-
agement of the affair is due the prom
committee which consisted of: Mary
Wright, chairman; Marion Miller,
Edna Shafer, Ellen Sheehan, Eliza-
beth Bach, Muriel Daggett. ‘
