THE NEWS SPEAKS FOR ITSELF

The News is ublished weekly
throughout the col ege year by the
Student Body of the New York State
College for Teachers. This means
that the News is the property of the
students. The Board of Editors is
merely an agent through which the
student body expresses itself.

Of late, however, the News Board
has come to feel that the student body
is forgetting that these editors are but
agents, not the principal. The editors
want wholehearted cooperation from
the students. The editors and report-
era are willing to do all in their pow-
er to make the News the best college
paper in the country. It is their des-
ire to make the paper as newsy as
posstble, to have it express student
feeling, to have it the herald of com-
ing events as well as the chronicles of
past happenings.

The attainment of this ideal is al-
most immpossible if the people to
whom reporters are sent for imforma-
tion are uninterested as to try vali-
antly to'escape the reporter, or at
best to give him as littlcjmformation
as posSible. Unfortunately, it is. not
the reporter’s paper. If it were, he
could write news—for theyare gifted
in that line (out of whole cloth.)
Curiously enough mistakes attract
more attention than good material.
. Again and again. the News has
asked organization to orters to have

.their material in on onday, before
twelve noon. Moreover, the ‘Round
about College’ column has suffered
considerably of late for lack of news.
This column aims to collect news
items of interest about ovoryono in
college. Organized bodies, such as
sorority houses, the Y house, Syddum,
and Newman Hall. ve been the
greatest support of the column so far.
but it is hoped that other people will
send material also.

. Our student forum, student Opin-
ion has grown miserably thin and
weak. There are plenty of things to
he " talked up " around these halls.
It does no good to “roast” people,
ideas. or institutions among a group
of persons who approve. Air your

grievances in the News. It will help
you to ﬁnd out if you are alone in the
world or not. This knowledge is
worth something. It Will save mis-
“ ‘ ' energy, if you are the only
one aggreived, and it may, if you are
in the right. . _
The News will be glad to print in
its columns of Grins any jokes the
passed on. Jokes or “ razz " stories
passed on. Jokes in “razz” stories
on members of the faculty or student
body will be especially appreciated.
Again the News asks your coopera-
tion. The Board of Editors will be
glad to have suggestions or critic~
isms from the student body. The
news is your publication. Help the
editors to make it the paper you want
it be. ’23
