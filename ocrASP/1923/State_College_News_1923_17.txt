PROFESSOR KIRTLAND’S
COLLEGE STUDIO MAY
REMAIN

Professor Kirtland tells the News
reporter that he has practically ﬁnish-
ed the photographic groups and spec-
ialties for the 1923 pedagogue. We
have seen enough of these prints to
promise an exceptional quality—in
this year’s senior annual—granted
that the engravers do their part.

But the professor says that groups
and humorous specialities are not very
interesting to a camera man who
thinks of photographic ‘ ' ' as a
means of art. The advanced workers
in this ﬁeld will ﬁnd their hobbies in
landscapes, in genre subjects, or in
the portraiture of interesting person-
alities. Just now, of course, condi-
tions out-of-doors limit the worker to
portraiture. But good portraiture is
a very complex and facinative study,
with its ﬁnal success depending on the
operators skill in bringing out and
recording the characteristic moods of
his subject.

e do not recall ﬁner portraits
than Mr. Kirtland’s recent studies of
Doctor Richardson. The News sug-
gests that many students and teachers
would be glad to see the ” College
Studio " remain in commission. In-
terested students should seek appoint-
ments in Room

Why are you trying to feed that

They Weighed Air——

and Charles

K " AMUEL PEPYS says in

‘ ‘ his diary that CharlesII,
for all his interest in the
Royal Society, laughed
uproariously at its members
"for spending their time only in
weighing of air and doing nothing
else since they sat.”

This helps to explain why
Charles has come down to us as
the “merry monarch."

The Royal Society was engaged
in important research. It was try-
ing to substitute facts for the

 

meaningless phrase “nature ab-.

hats a vacuum,” which had long
served to explain why wath
rushes into a syringe—the c'om-
monest form of pump—when the
piston is pulled out.

Denis Papin had as much to do
as anyone with these laughable
activities of the Royal Society.
Papin turned up in London one
day with a cylinder in which a
piston could slide. He boiled water
In the cylinder. The steam gener-
ated pushed the piston out. When‘
the flame was removed, the steam

condensed. A vacuum was formed
and the weight of the outer air
forced the unresisting mm m.

Out of these rcscarc cs eventuoi

ally came the steam engine.

London talked of the scandalous
life that King Charles led, and paid
scant attention to such physicists
as Papin, whose work did so much
to change the whole character of
industry.

The study of air and air pumps
has been continued in 3 its of
Charlcs’s laughter. In the encral
Electric Company's Research
Laboratories, for instance, pumps
have been developed which will ex-
haust all but the last ten-billionth
of an atmosphere in a vessel.

This achievement marks the
beginning of a new kind of chemis-
try—a chemistry that concerns
itself with the effect of forces on
matter in the absence of air, a
chemistry that has already en-
riched the world with invaluable
improvements in illumination, ra-
dio communication, and roentgen-

ology.
