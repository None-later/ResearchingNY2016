STATE COLLEGE NEWS, FEBRUARY 9, I923

RUTH DRAPER' INTERVIEWED
(continued from page 1)
everything else becomes perfectly na-

tural, and you are that person.

Young Boswell—You did your mon-
oluges in ‘Paris.

Ruth Draper—Yes. Of course the
French have-always had monologues.
I appeared at the Theatre de L’Oeu—
vrc, under the management of Lugne
Poe. He brOUght Ibsen to Paris for
the ﬁrst performances and he has
donc'much to modernize the French
theatre. The French are such good
critics, and it was agrcat satisfaction
to know that they Were interested

in my work.

The effect of monologues upon
children is extraordinary. Chil—
dren have the most unclouded imagin-

. atlons and unsophisticated minds.
They are a perfect audience. I was
told about a child of twelve
who saw one of my sketches. At the

end she clung to her mother and cried
out. “Did she really kill that man?”
And one little boy wanted to know
where all the other people had gone.

Young Boswell—Do you always
write your own sketches?

Ruth Draper—Yes. I can’t seem
to do anyone else’s. Not many inci—
dents lend themselves to monologues
It has to be one person talking to am
other, but in such a situation as not
to have to repeat the conversation,
but only to suggest what the other
person has said. Though I’ve had
many sketches submitted to me, I’ve
never been able to feel them, as I do
my own. Let me tell you about one
time, when I was doing‘ my things at
a boy’s school. The platform was
only about a foot high, and the boys
in the front row put their feet up,
as boys will. I was doing “The Rail-
way Stution," and you remember in
that I swept the snow out of the room.
(She rose and began to sweep with
an imaginary broom.) You remem-
ber? Well, as I was doing that the
boys all took their feet down to not
out of the way of the snow. And
Young Boswell found he, too, had
drawn his feet up under him to not

out of the way of that broom. A _

very real illusion!
