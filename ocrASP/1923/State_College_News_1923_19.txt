STUDENT ASSEMBLY

Professor Walker presented the
question to the student assembly Fri
day morningr of raising the coach's
salary from $1,700 to $2,000. At
present the State pays the coach a
salary of $1,700 and the question is
whether the Finance Board, by the
sanction of the student body, shall in
its annual budget, include $300 extra
for the purpose of increasing the
coach’s salary to $2,600. Many argu-
ments were given on both sides and
the question, after much heated dis-
cussion, was left over for future
decision.

SYDDUM GIVES DINNER DANCE

Syddum Hall was the scene of a
very delightful dinner dance Saturday
evening, February 10, 1023. Since
this is an annual affair, the prepara—
tions which had been made were ex-
tensive and the decorations consisting
of ferns, palms, and college banners
were particularly attractive.

Dinner was served at six-thirty in
the dining; room at small tables which
had yellow daffodils for their center-
pieces.

Aftcr dinner the dancing, which
continued until eleven-thirty, began
in the library and living' rooms. The
house colors, orange and gray, were
used in the dance favors. Music was
furnished by a three piece orchestra.
Miss Pierce, Miss Steele, Miss Perinel
and Mrs. Leary were chaperons for
the affair. Among the guests of the
girls at the house were men from
Brown, R P. 1., Union, Springfield,
and Syracuse.

The successful occasion was largely
due to the direction of Sophia Cohen,
’2 Officers of Syddum Hall are:
Gladys Mcsercau, ’25, President
Joyce Dwycr, ’25. Vice president.
Madeline Finch, ’25, Secretary.
Adelaide Grueschow, ’26, Treasurer.

The tossers for Fordham are not
as strong: this season as they have
been in former years, and State and
the Albany Law School whom they
play February 16, may each hope for
a victory. .

State‘s Varsity have had ample
time for rest and practice since the
Alumni game and should be able to
give the visitors a good hard fight.
As the teams will be more evenly
matched than they have been in many
of our former games, We may look
for good fast playinp,‘ all through the
name.

 

‘ FROSH TEAM DEFEATED BY
SUFFIELD

The basketball game played in the
State College gymnasium February 10
between the Suffield five and the
“fresh” resulted in a victory for the
visiting team.

During: the first half both fives
iplaycd nearly evenly, but in the
second half State’s frosb went down
under the fast playing of the
Suffield team.

The “fresh” put up a good stiff
fight all during the game, but they
were outclassed by Suffield‘s five
in both size and weight. Neither
State’s Varsity or “fresh” team has
men of equal weight. As a result the
game could have but one result:
defeat for thc “frosh” who went down
in the whirlwind of fast plays pulled
off by the Suffield five.

 “college Concert To Be
‘ Given February 23

Os-Kc-Non-Ton, lndinn Singer
' Spacial Feature

The Music Association will present
the Women’s Chorus assisted by
Os—Ke-Non-Ton, the college orches-
tra, and the Men's Double Quartet, in
a concert at Chancellors Hall, Friday
evening, February 23.

Os-Kc-Non-Ton will be the special
and unusual featureof the concert.
He is a full blooded Mohawk lndian,
and is still a chief of that tribe, as
were his ‘father and gramlfather.
Running; Deer, as his name may be
translated, is a graduate of an
American High School, but he still
lives with the Indians during the
summer, and does concert singing:
during- the winter. He has a fine
baritone voice, and he appears on
the stage in his native costume and
sings a collection of traditional
songs of the Six Nations and other
western tribes. There are only
three or four such men in America,
and Os-Ke-Non—Ton is considered
the best. '

The second attraction will be the
College Chorus. This year there
are about one hundred women in
the chorus, and they will sing: two
groups of songs. The first will be
a group of Negro Spirituals, “Didn’t
It Rain,” “Meeting Here Tonia-ht,”
and “Deep River." The first two
are rather humorous, typically
"nig'gcl'y" songs, showing a little of
the negro interpretation of religion
and Bible stories. The third of this
group is considered one of the best
and most beautiful of the negro
spirituals. The second group will be
made up of songs written especially
for the chorus by Mr. Candlyn. The
first is to be a lullaby, “Sleep, Sleep,
Beauty Bright,” the words of which
were written by William Blake.
“The Shadow March,” a dainty
little march of ghosts and goblins,
will be the second number, and this
Will be its first presentation in public
The last of the group will be the
“Hottentot Child.” another humor—
ous selection.

As the final touches on the pro-
gram, the orchestra will play two
groups of selections, and the Men's
Double Quartet will sing two groups
of songs.

The selections for this concert are

being chosen with the idea of show-
ing the students the best American
musnc. the Negro and Indian folk
songs, and» also the really modern
aAmerican songs.
I All students will be admitted on
ithelr student tax tickets, and out-
sule‘s Will 'be charged an admission
of fifty cents.
