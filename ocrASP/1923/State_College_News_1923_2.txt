Letz String Quartet to Give
Concert

Presented by Mulic Association

Perhaps the most important; musical
event of the college season will be
the recital by the Letz String Quartet
of New York in Chancellors’ Hall.
Saturday, January 13 at 8.15 P.
The recital was to have been given by
the London String Quartet, but last
Saturday Dr. ’l‘hompson received the
unwelcome news that; the London
Quartet were cancelling their concerts
on account of. the serious illness of
the first violin player, Mr. Lovey.
it was decided to cancel the concert
entirely unless a chamber music
organization of equal rank could be
obtained. Dr. ’l‘hompson was fortun—
ate enouin to secure the beta Quar-
tet, which ranks with the London and
the ll‘ionzuley Quartets as the three
finest in the country. Mr. Letz per-
mitted Dr. ’l‘hompson to select two~
thirds of the program, the other third
being Fritz Kroislcr’s new Quartet
in A minor.

The entire gallery will be reserved
for students of the college who have
student tax tickets. Students pre-
ferring to sit on the orchestra floor
may obtain seats there by paying a
small additional fee. ’l‘ickets for
outsiders will cost $l.50. The seat
sale is directed by Dr. Thompson, the
Music Council, and the Women’s
Chorus.

The program is made up of three
groups. In the first group appears
Mozart‘s Quartet in C major, widely
regarded as the most beautiful quar-
tet of the classical school. it is in
four movements, the most famous
being the second, the Andante
Cantabile. The second group is made,
up of selections from Schubert's
Quartet in D minor, the finest quartet
of the nineteenth century romantic
school, and parts of Debussy’s Qua“-
tct in G minor, the best known quar-
tet of the modern French school. The
.hird group offers the four movements
of Fritz Kreisler‘s new Quartet in
A minor.

The members of the auartet are:
Hans Letz, first violin: Edwin Bach-
mann, second violin: Edward Kreiner.
viola; and Horace Britt, ’cello. The
headquarters of the quartet is New

IDramatic Class to Present

Plays

Finest Productions Ever Staged By
Class

Tuesday evening, January 16, at
8.15 o’clock, in the Albany High
School Auditorium there will be given
by the Drumutics
Class of College. These three plays
have been chosen from a large group
of the best and most successfully
given modern plays. The costs are
splendid and each player is very well
suited to her part. l'lvery attention
has been given to the perfection of
every detail of the plays. They are
predestined to be very successful.

The first play, ’Op 0' Mo Thumb,
by Fred Fem and Richard Price, is
a typical English play, based on life
in an English laundry. The types in
the play are crude, very human
cockney working girls whose tempers
keep them always interestingly antag-
onistic. Rose, Clem and Celeste make
Amanda and her vivid imagination a
butt for their curiosity. Her imag—
inations materialize in u very appeal-
ing manner. Margery Bayless plays
Amanda; Clara Fahnstock, Rose;
Dorothy Bennit, Clem; Florence Dor-
sey. Celeste; Elinor Buell, Madam;
and Edward Vines, ’Orris.

Miss Tnssey. by Elizabeth Baker,
is a tragedy which keeps one wonder-
.ing just what will happen next.
lltosie is hysterically frivolous, loves
lgood clothes and gaiety; Possie, ver
,matter of fact, has her hands ful
ibetween Rosie and 'l‘ossey who acts
illioﬂi’. strangely during the play.
,‘Hynopsis is given of Miss Tassey
i because if one were given the drama-
}tic effect would be somewhat lessened.
iGladys Hayner plays Rosie; Aileen
i Wallace. I’ossie: Helena BorsickI Miss
,l.i|mnertou; Winifred Dunn, Sarah;
Iliathryn Shipman. 'l‘assey.

"The Maker of Dreams" by Clint]-
ant Downs is a most charming fan-
tasy: Pierrot is fickle and does not
see Pierrette's charms until his eyes
are opened by the Maker. The plot is
very simple. It is the dainty acting
of the players, the soft music. the
quaint setting and costumes that
makes the play one of the most
delightful of any that most of us have
ever seen. Betty Nagle plays Pierrot;
Katherine Driscoll, Pierrette; Edna
l'ihnfer. the Maker.

If one misses these plays, one will
surely miss one of the finest product-
ions that the Dramatics Class has
ﬁve" staged.

Tickets are‘fifty and seventy-five
cents to outsiders. Students are
admitted on their student tax tickets.

A large proportion of the songs
are humorous ones collected from
State College and other colleges.

The songbook will probably sell at

a maximum price of. $1.50. Sub-
scription blanks will be made shortly

The book is due to appear for
Moving-Up Day.

 

$3.00 per year

Sophomores Entertain
Seniors

’l‘he Sophomore Class entertained
the Seniors Friday evening, January
5, in the college gym. After a vain
search on the part of the Sophomore
fora Senior partner the Grand March
began, led by the two presidents,
Gladys Hayncr. ’23 and Mildred
Hammersley,~ ’25. When the gym.
had been completely traversed and
the red and green decorations thor-
oughly admired the procession halted
while the Sophomore president briefly
welcomed the class of '23. Louise
Welch then came skipping down the
steps and entertained the audience so
well by her dancing that she had to
be recalled. The startling announce-
ment of a “skit in four flaps" then
caused everyone to sit up and take
notice. After the audience had been
left in darkness for a few moments
they were confronted by a sheet sus-
pended in the air over which appeared

Junior Jamboree a Success

“All 1 Want is Sociability.” song
he juniors Friday evening, January 5.
However, such a song was unneces-
sary for everyone was sociable. The
party was small but select. Since
dancing was prohibited everyone en-
tered into the games with zest,——-re-
solving to get out of them all the fun
they put in them—and it was accom-
plished. Songs. cheers, and games
were filled with pep and vim. Child~
hood parties returned to worn-out
memories and thoughts of hardships
to come were banished. From the
‘first song to the last glass of lemon-
ade “joy was unconfined." The party
in the gym. may have had its attract-
ions but the Jamboree in Room 250
rivaled it in its own special way.
