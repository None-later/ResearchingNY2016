ARE WE. GAME?

Bobble gobble, razzle dazzle, zipp.
Much excitement in the student life
of State College! Variety is the spice
of our existence and now after two
weeks (which have seemed like
countless scans) of concentrated vigil
with the midnight oil, our souls are
filled with that insatiable yearning for
something that will relieve the mon-
otony and add zest to the routine.
A bomb was dropped in the form of a
Very short notice on the bulletin board
sometime during Thursday and it ex-
ploded Friday in assembly, scattering
refutation missles here and there
which especially hit the men and the
juniors. Its effects were wonderful—
everybody became electrically ani-
mated, there were wild discussions pro
and con, and even room-mates were
torn asunder by the heat of the argu-
ment.

But now that the flash is over, .

let's get down to brass tacks and
think as soundly and logically as our

“ EVERY DAY "

“Every day in every way I can do
some one thing better than I did it
yesterday." “Ha ha!" laughs the
cynic, “another way of amusing the
dear public!” But strange to say it
is not merely a phrase coined for
amusing those who hear it; it does not
involve the mental concentration and
revolution that the venerable Dr.
Coue’s patented phrase involves; it
merely states a fact in sort of catch
fashion. .

When we, if we take the time, ask
ourselves just how perfect our yester-
days wcre, we are very apt to say
that we shall do better tomorrow.

Very often we make excuses for our- h

selves; very often we don't even make
excuses. We know of course what
we need, a sure cure dose of patent
medicine, the kind that tastes nice.
But as the sages and own our own
selves have admitted time and again,
only in different language, "there are
no such animal i" We must {see the
fact of a slow and tedious cure.
Nothing could be simpler than saying
to ourselves once a day or mine
"Every day—I will do better!”
If it doesn’t work, it can at least

mentality will permit us. Do we want
to raise the salary of a coach for
State College to $2,000? In the
first place we all have college spirit

(in various amounts but then it’s
there all right) and we would all like
to have our college on a par with the
other colleges with which We compete
in athletic contests. We realize we
are sadly deficient in the quantity of
our men but we believe we could be
efficient in the quality of our team
members. One of the big requisites
for this efficiency is a capable coach
who can spend all his time and energy
with his proteges and in order to ob
tain a man of this calibre, we must
pay the price. Perhaps it can be
pulled elsewhere but on this earth
anyway we keenly appreciate the fact
that nothing comes gratis. While
perhaps a $2,000 coach could not pro-
duce a stellar team out of our mater-
ial, yet he might be able to so train
our men that we could win a few
games and even a few basketball
Victories might serve as an induce-
ment for possible male freshmen. Of
course none of us can estimate results
with certainty but aren’t State Colleg-
ians game to make a trial, especially
if that.trial may raise our athletic
reputation? Dr. Brubacher states
that he has a prospective candidate in
mind ——wouldn’t his recommendation
of a coach influence our decision to
exert all efforts in bringing that man
ere?

And now concerning the student
body making a disastrous precedence
by raismg the salarv of an instructor
in order to keep him in the faculty
of ﬁtatc Collette —— if a professor has
decided to Widen his field and broaden
his own capabilities, three hundred
dollars is not going to deter him on
his road. to highest advancement.

oney will be all to him in his avoid-
ance of stagnation.

So do we want to raise the salary
of our coach to $2,000? Let’s re-

Years and years ago when the
world was new, there was but one
great kingdom on all the earth. And I
the ruler of all this great kingdom,
for he was as wise as he was great,
decided that the young; of the‘king-
dom should have an opportunity to
share in the great learning.

So he called unto himself a noted
Wise man who in turn called unto
himself many other wise men.
nether they founded an institution of
learning where they might instruct
the young as the ruler had command-
ed. And a hetrog‘cncous mass, who
had been previoust educated
known and unknown masters, appear-
ed before them.

Gladly the wise men took up the
task of instructing the newcomers.
They showed them the writings of
their ancestors, and pointed out which
was good and which was bad. They
told them of the birds, the beasts,
and the flowers; of the method used
in keeping the accounts of the royal
treasury; of chemistry and physics,
and the laws of great philosophers.

David Crowo was a devout church-
goer. The young minister of his
church was also devout, but easily em-
barrassed.

Imagine the consternation of Mr.
Crowe and the delight of the congre-
gation, when the young divine solemn-
ly said in prayer meeting: “And now,
will Brother Pray please crow for us?

When the battle of Mobile Bay was
over, and the ships had anchored,
Lieutenant Commander Perkins who
commanded the Chickasaw went on
board the Hartford to report to Ad-
miral Farragut. Perkins was a hand-
some dashing fellow, bright and pop—
ular.

After calling on the Admiral he
went below to the ward room, where
he found the officers standing around
the table, and the Chaplain with
prayer book in hand just about to
read the prayer of Thanksgiving for
Victory. Perkins stopped at the door,
and the Chaplain sceing him, said in
a solemn voice, “Captain, won’t you
join us?”

“No, thanks. old man," replied
Perkins. “I’ve just had two with the
Admiral."

called the other wise men to him and
said: "you have taught long and
diligently. You must now find what
benefit your pupils have derived from
your instruction."

The wise men then conferred
together and decided to form ques-
tions on that of which they had
spoken, and find to what degree each
of their pupils had absorbed the great
knowledge. And they graded the
answers of each and made report to
the noted wise man.

With some he was well-pleased,
but with others he was in depair. And
he shook his head sadly, and said, “it
is of no avail to keep some of these
with us. They have gained nothing;
from our. teaching, and we certainly
have gained nothing from them.” So
ill! called this certain few unto him,
and bid them seek advantage in other
fields, and, if perchtincc they chose to
return when they were more capable
they would be welcome.

As they filed out, one by one, from
the institution of learning, high on
this top of Mount Olympus the gods,
looked at each other, smiled, and
