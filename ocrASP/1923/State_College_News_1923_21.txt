G. A. A. ACTIVITIES

A band of bathing beauties created
quite a splash at Bath No. 3 last
Tuesday night. I said beauties; per-
haps the adjective should be limited
to those who owned their bathing
suits, judging from what I have heard
about the suits for rent. At any rate
the G. A. A. party must have been a
Jolly one (reports are not yet in) as
outings always are where lovers of
the same thing get together.

 

Jingle bells, jingle bells,

Jingle all the way.

A sleigh ride party Saturday

Is planned by the . . .

If nothing happens to the weather,
country roads will be in excellent con-
dition for sleighing. Arrangements
have not as yet been completed, but
the merry party is expected to start
late in the afternoon, and continue
long enough to arouse keen appetites

or a hot delicious supper in the
"cafe."

Then who among the motors for
our boys Saturday night will be more
alive and full ‘0 pep than those
G. A. A. gals who have been “taking
the air” all afternoon?

In Akron, 0., a station porter
thanked me for my tip.

I remember Denver. Colo., because
there a barber shared my neck before
I could stop him.

In Miama, Fla., I was asked to join
the Ku Klux ( an.

I am the man who heard the woman
say the Grand Canyon was cute.

In Atlanta a waiter emptied kidney
stow in my lap.

In a Detroit drug store I innocently

ordered a glass of sursupariila to re-:

ceive a drink of gin and a check [or
sixty-five cents.

The police of Joplin, Me., arrested
me for vagrancy.

At Atlantic City I saw a girl, pretty
as a royal flush, asleep on the sand,
and snoring.

Chicago always reminds me of the
confidence man with the wiretapping
scheme. who let me win my first bet,
after which I quit.

Admiring the sunset from the roof

THE COACH AND HIS SALARY

It seems to be the opinion of thosa
State College students who are so
strongly in favor of raising our
coacns salary at our own expense
that a better paid coach means a
better team, a better team means
that more men will be attracted to
State College, more men means better
material from which to choose and a
still better team, and soon State
College will stand at the top in
athletics. All these points, if they
were not suppositionul,might be reall
strong arguments. But after al,
does a coach make a team? Can a
college which offers merely A. B. and
B. S. courses expect to attract manly
men‘.’ Have we the gymnasium faci -
ities to develop real athletes? Would
these men who might come to State
College be willing to keep in training
in order to develop a better team'l
If more students of either sex did
come to State College could we pos-
sibly accommodate them?

 

. In the first place a coach cannot
i make a team. He can merely develop
{a team. That team, to begin with,
lmust have a thorough knowledge of
ithe game, good physique, _perfect
[co-ordination between brain and
muscle, much practice, and some high
ischool experience at least. Moreover,
the members of the team should con-
form the usual rules in regard to
eating, sleeping and smoking. Then,
and only then, can a team he a
,success, regardless of the salary of the
lcoach.

i But you say if the material which
we havu is better trained by a better
paid coach some games will be won
and more men will be attracted to
State College. Do you think really

good; athletes will be ‘a‘ttructcd to
State College when large colleges,
like Colgate andI-Iamilton are pawn:
their way and glad to get them for
their teams? Do you think many
men ‘are inclined to take an arts and
science course when they might make
a choice of engineering, pharmacy,
journalism, dentistry or law '! An arts
course may attract the scholarly type
of man, but not, as a. rule, the
athletic. Naturally all men prefer to
attend a college which offers a big
choice of professions.

Of course teams, to be regular
teams, must keep in training and
abide by certain health laws. Not
even is the suggestion being made
that our team does not do this. Only
the fact- that regular rules make a
regular team is being stated. Let our
men be their OWn judges. '

Just one look at our gymnasium
and college buildings will prove that
we have neither the gymnasium facil-
ities to develop real athletes nor the
building facilities 'to accommodate
more students. If applications are to
be sent in only to be returned, what
is the use of atracting people to State
College and than keeping them out-
side the gates? Then, too, if students
cannot p'ay their present class dues
or college tax, how can they possibly
pay a heavier tax? No objections
as to this action being a bad precedent
or quibbling over forty cents being
added to the student tax is entering
into this discussion. Only a few plain
facts have been put before you for
consideration by a student who is

willin to back up her college in all
suitab e actions. Think them over
seriously, then make your own
decision.
