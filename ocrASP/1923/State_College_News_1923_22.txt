(From the issue of Feb. 28, 1917.)
S. C. T. Defeats R. P. I., 22—21
The State College basketball team

scored a 22 to 21 victory over the
Rensselacr Polytechnic Institute five
in Albany High School gymnasium in
a game admitted by local papers to
have been one of the greatest contests
staged in Albany in years.

Coach Wachter is receiving compli-
ments from all sources upon the won-
derful showing made by the team.

Woolscy, R. P. I. center and con-
sidered the best center in intercollcg‘
iatc basketball was outplayed by
"Honey" Miller who outScored him
from the field by 6 to 4. The R. P. I.
men stated they had brought all their
subs in order to give State a chance.
As matters turned out the subs re-
mained on the bench and even the
regulars could not accomplish what
the subs had been expected to do.

Dances
The State College dances, directed
by Miss Jack Wilbur and Edwin John-
stone, will continue during the second
semester, evory Friday from 4 :30 to

These dances were very popular and

 

In Days” of Old

started many people on the road to be
good conservative dancers.

The college orchestra will be used
and everyone is cordially invited.

State College Observes Universal
Day of Prayer for Students

The officers of the World’s Stu-
dent Christian Federation appointed
Sunday, February 24th as the uni-
versal day of prayer for students.
Our college through the Y. W. C. A.
observed this day of prayer by a
meeting of the students in the college
auditorium Sunday afternoon. Maud
Rose led the meeting. Mary Wish
sang.

Many college students have answer-
ed the call to arms and some are
“over there” now. Those students
remaining behind must do all in their
power to “keep the home fires burn—
ing." It was for that the meeting
was held.
