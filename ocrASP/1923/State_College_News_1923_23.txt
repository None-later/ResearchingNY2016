Beauty Bright,” the “Shadow March"
and l"l‘he Hottentot Child.” In addi-
tion to these two groups the chorus

Up Rules For Regulation 0f

lnterclass Rivalry

REVISED AND APPROVED BY MYSKANIA

by Dr. Brubaehcr in his address on

Class Rivalry and College ’,I‘raditlon, Myskaiiia appointed an interciass
committee to draw up a new body of rules in accordance with which class
i'mih'y might be carried on in a suitable manner.

RUTH DRAPER SCORES BIG
SUCCESS AT STATE

We happened by chance to have
had the good fortune oi,’ meeting that
most charming and versatile author-
acti'css, ltuth Draper, who held us
entranced with her plays in mono-
logue. last Friday evening. We were
so ovorcoiiiu by her extreme simplicity
unai‘l‘vctediiess, and good nature that
we quite forgot to be a true reporter
and ask the usual questionaire oi'
reporter’s questions. But by so doing
We found out the most interesting
things.

You can not help but know that
Ituth Draper is a very normal person
when you hear that she just loves to
l‘i(li‘ down hill. And she loves bright
red hats and dres s. In fact one of
the first things she asked us was what
color llll(l kind of dress she should
\veai' For the recital. and she described
at length her three party-best i'roeks.
We decided upon yellow and yellow
it was.

Does SilL' like dogs and shrimp
salad? We don’t know; but we do
know that she dates on people. She
loves to meet them and talk to them.

Her looks? Of? course we didn't
have to ask questions about her looks,
we just feasted our eyes and discov-
ered that she uses no make up and
no hair nets. 0 were quite over
joyed at this fact because we don’t
either, except the hair nets.

We wriggled comfortably in our
woolen stockings and goloshes, and
smiled happily at oursclf when we saw
shiny well-worn brogues on iss
Draper’s feet when she removed the
Four-buckled flappers, just like our
own. We just swelled up with pride
and joy at the thought of meeting this
charming fairy-story lady. When she
said “good—bye” and shook our
woolen—mitted hand with hers we
sighed and wished that every celebrity
in the world might be as delightfully
gracious.

The following is the comment on
Miss Draper from the Knickerbocker
Press:

“One need not spend years becom-
ing acquainted with the feminine
branch ol" the human family. Two
hours with Ruth Draper IS a post-
graduate course, and the crode
house last night at Chancellors’ Hall
that heard this versatile artist, met
men. women and children of all ages
and dispositions. as this small, slender
lwomun created them out of her mind

jl'mm various colleges on this subject
and compared these results with our
