REWARD OFFERED

Last Week "The News” was re-
quested to print a few statements
about March 7. A day or two before
the last issue of the paper there ap-
peared on various bulletin boards in
College a slip of cardboard with the
printing “March 7”. This was fol-
lowed in a few days by “7:45 P. M.”
Since then there has appeared “Audi‘-
torium”, and “No Charge". The
News is at a loss to know what these
cryptic signs mean, but it looks as
though there was going to be an E1-
tertainment of some sort in the au-
ditorum on the evening of March 7,
which is to be free to the students of
the College. But what kind of an en-
tertainment? Any reader of “The
News," who sends $3.00 as an en-
trance fee, is entitled to yiess what
kind of an entertainment is to be
given; the successful contestant will
receive a subscription to “The News
for the years 1923-24. All answers
must be handed in at “The News
office in person on or before Feb. 29.

All students will be admitted on
their student tax tickets, and out-
siders will be charged an admission of
fifty cents. The students are re-
quested to sit downstairs in order that
those taking part may not be discour-
aged by looking at empty seats.
Special tickets will be given out,
therefore, to the students after chapel
Friday.

Well sir, we’re here! We went to
the mail box and found no flunk
notes. We jammed into the Regis-
trar’s and came out quaking with a
pack of yellow cards in our hand.
Cautioust we glanced at each one
and after we had counted eight hours

to our credit we began to swell up.
Then when we saw that for at least
one semester more we could enjoy
roaming around our own S. C. '.
we rushed once more to the mail box
and seeing other happy kindred spirits
expressing their joy in the most acro-
batically physical manner, we acro-

bated too. We forgot that we had
mly two more credits than we needed:
we forgot that certain professors rv-

I‘, gnrdcd us doubtfully: W0 ("m-got id!

but the fact that “we're livi'v-wbv-
cause—" and to each one that In,-
cuusc is one of two things, kindnms
or merit.

 

STUDENT COMMENT

COLLEGE TRADITIONS

Have we College traditions, or do
we just think that we have some? We
know that certain articles printed in
every freshman handbook, are called
traditions and that is about every-
thing that most of us know.

Of course, the freshman class is
called on to observe more traditions
than other classes and each member
should be glad to do so. But. do
you remember last Friday in Chapel?

According to College traditions the
freshmen are supposed to remain
seated until the other classes have
gone out. Instead of this, the jam at
the exits was helped by the freshman
class, as a body, trying to get out be-
fore anyone else.

No one at the time seemed to rc~
alize that the freshmen were break-
ing tradition. They certainly put
one over on the other classes or, at
least, they said the were. The up-
per classes grumb ed because they
were pushed and shoved aside, but
did nothing. The Sophomores, who
are called on to make their younger
friends obey rules and traditions,
could do nothing as all class rivalry
is suspended. The freshmen seem to
realize this and rejoiceabout it by
doing whatever they please, even go-
ing so far as to break traditions. .

It is up to the freshmen to behave l
themselves, to steady down and re-
member that tradition must be
obeyed by them as well as by the up-
per classmen. They must resist the
tem tation of going in the front door,
of Sitting in the rotunda, and of get~
ting up before the others have left
chupeL

’26, it is up to you! Of course,
you can force the other classes to
make you obey but this is foolish.
You would have to bear the dislike

 

 

 

of the sophomores. the apologies of
the juniors, and the sarcastic com-4

ments of the seniors. it is a fine
thing for a college to have traditions,
but is an even ﬁner thing to have
them obeyed by the students.

What are you going to do, class of
'26? Are you going to honor your
college and her traditions, or are
you going to dishonor your class by
disobeying her traditions?

SABBATICAL LEAVE FOR FAC-
ULTY OF STATE

At the meeting of the Board of
Trustees of the State College for
Teachers on December 1, 1922, a plan
for providing for sabbatical leaves
“or professors and assistant professors
of State College was presented by
President Brubucher. After consid-
ering this plan. the Board of Trustees
accepted the plan and recommended
its presentation to the Board of Re-
gents for consideration and action.

If this plan met with the approval
of the Board of Regents, it was re-
commended that a new section to be
known as section 65 be added to the
Regmts Rules to read as follows:

half year for travel, study or re-
search. A member of the faculty on
such leave must have his program of
study or travel approved in advance
by the President of the College and

 

‘he must upon completion of such

leave, report to the President of the

 

have been absent due to illness: llmm
Horncr, Professor Hutchinson, l’ro-
fessor Walker, Mr. Deyo. Prol'essn'
