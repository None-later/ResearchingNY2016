G. A. A. NOTES
JUNlORS DEFEAT SOPHOMORES

Monday, February ii), the sopho-
mores and juniors clashed in what
will be the la,.t game between them
this season unless the teams tic.

'l‘hc juniors started out in fine
shape. Ball after hall dropped into
their basket until, at the end of the
first half. the serm- was highly in
favor of ’24. in the meantime the
sophomores had lreen “warming,r Lip.”
’i‘hey beean the s end half with de-
termination, and [gradually succeeded
in making the jiinio“s look anxious;
but their good work unfortunately
was a little late in starting. and the
game ended in the iunlo.‘s' favor with
a score of 37 to l8.

Quest—How does Bill Heineniann
keep the ball aa'ollina'?

ns.——She never trim to use it for
a pillow.

We are glad that Hilda Liebiech
will probably get her lette“s in spite
of the fact that her knee was again
put out of commission.

G. A. A. GIVES SLEIGHRIDE

The G. A. A. held its annual sieiuh-
ride on Saturday, February 17, from
five until seven.

Was it cold? Those who went on
the G. A. A. sleigh-load won't tell you
so, for they will say that you don't
notice how cold it is when you are
packed in and are having; a wonderful
time. And there were a good many
girls who enjoyed the outing a great
deal more thnii last year, for last
Saturday there Were two leads of
girls. The sleiuhs lel't college about
five o’clock and want out toward the
Country Club. The trip was not so
ion]: that it froze any one, but even
if it had, she soon would have thawed
out when she reached college, for
there they found a lot of hot food to
eat. During the ride some of the
G. A. A. e'irls remained behind to
prepare hot dogs, cream potatoes
and cocoa for those who had none
out on the loads. With this Welcome
waitin‘er them the girls forgot to feel
the least bit chilled and went to eating
with a zest that only a sleigh—load can
arouse. So once again G. A. A. has
been very successful in its good old-
l'ashioned sleigh-load entertainment
and has many enlhuslatic l'tCl'LlltS l'or
