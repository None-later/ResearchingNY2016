STATE COLLEGE NEWS. FEBRUARY 23. I923

RUTH DRAPER SCORES BIG
SUCCESS AT STATE
(Continued from page 1)
and her abundant talent for char-

ucterizatlon.

“Ruth Draper is her own cast of
characters. The voice, the hands, the
body all go to realize these everyday
people; it is impersonation made
perfect, yet so realistic that n more
shawl drawn about her head creates
an old Ilewish grandmother; nimble
hands at a switchboard and a limp
manner tell of the switchboard girl
on a hot day, and the three ages of
married life are vivificd across a bare
table. Her voice can echo the silly
debutante, gushing her way through
a conversation; it can picture a
mother trying- to manage her children
at a party, and a “Main Street‘ accent
trying- to instill Greek plastic art in
heavyweights.

“’l‘he recital was given by the State
College Dramatic and Art Associa-
tion and Miss Agnes Futterer of the
faculty introduced Miss Draper.”
