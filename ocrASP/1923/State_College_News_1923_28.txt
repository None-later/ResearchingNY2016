CATON PLAYS GOOD GAME
TEAM TO GO ON TRIP

State’s basket-ball five were de—
feated ’I‘liursday, February I5, by the
Hamilton College five, the score
being [lb—~18. The first five min-
utes of play were the hardest for the
visitors for after that they continued
to pile up the score rapidly. Our
five put up a good strong fight at
the start. of the contest and it looked
as if it were to be a struggle to the
end. Donne, varsity center for lIani-
ilton, broke into the scoring game
during the first minute of play. He
followed this up with another two
points shortly afterw: 'd. Ilornung
placed State on the scoring side with
a field goal and a foul point. For
several initiates the game was a close
guarding contest with neither side
being able to pile up any scores.
Hatch put the visitors on th '1' 'eet
by scoring twice in rapid su on
and Deane added another on a one-
lianded toss. Hamilton continued to
add scores until at the end of the

some of our money for them.

[Iut the greatest attraction in store
for us will be the doll booth. Those
who attended last year will remember
how darling the little dolls were, and
will know what to expect this year.
These dolls are not only just orna-
mental but they are to be dressed in
costumes which will give those of us
who are not inclined to be Iv‘reneh an
idea of the custom and style of cloth-
ing used among the peasants. As a
rule few are acquainted with the
clothes of the provincial people. for
influence of the Parisian models in
our daily life prevents us from going

Storm of Applause Greeteil
The State College Concert

PRIMITIVE SONGS BY MOHAWK
CHIEF AND WORK OF CHORUS,
ORCHESTRA AND GLEE CLUB

SUPERB
The State College Music Associa-
tion, assisted in its concert last night
in Chaneellors‘ Hall by Chief Os-Ke—

Non-’l‘oa of the Mohawks, raised a

storm of applause as violent as any

that ever swept over the forests
through which the redskins 200‘yeurs
ago in their war paint run silently
until their war-cry burst with start-
ling suddenness.

The atmosphere of bygone savagery
and Indians stalking prey in thell'or-
ests, or white men stalking Indians,

set of the Mohawk chi: s recital of
primitive music by his song behind
the scenes, accompanied by the steady
heat of the tom tom, an Indian form
of the drum.

When Chief Os—Ke-Non-Ton ap-
peared at the end of this song, his
audience was in the mood for prim—
itive music and responded visibly and
,very audiny to his interpretation of
lthe earliest music on the American
continent. He sang, always accom-
panied by the tom tom, the lullaby
songs. the campfire songs, the war
songs of the Indians, and also three
others, “By the Waters of Minne<
tonke,” “Blanket Song” and “Pale
Moon.” He held the large and dis-
tinguished audience in tremulous
quiet until the deep rolling sounds of
his voice died away, and the colors
of the pristine forest conjured up in
the imaginations of the audience had
faded and the atmosphere was again
that of Chancellors’ Hall at a college
get-together.

Chorus, Orchestra and Glee Club.

Excellent work was done by the
Women’s chorus, the College orches-
tra and the Men’s Glee club, all under
the direction of Harold W. Thompson
and T. Frederick H. Candlyn.
“Shadow March,” composed by Can1l«
lyn, was particularly well sung by the
Women’s chorus, as well as three
Negro spirituals. “Highland Patrol,

 

the Wee MacGregor" was cxception~
ally Well liked among the work of the l
orchestra. l

The audience ﬁlled almost every
seat in the large ball and was very,
