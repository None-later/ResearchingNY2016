WORK vs PLAY

The lazy feeling that warns of the
springtime is just beginning to make
itself felt. Mid year exams are over,
and finals in June are a long way off»
The days are becoming longer and:
sometimesthe sun shines. It is indeed'
hard to study under these conditions.
It is a lot better for our comfort to
rest on our glorious records for the
past semester than to seek any more
glory during the present semester.

It is a wise move, however, to keep
in touch with the general trend of the
courses in order that when a test
happens along we may at least know
what chapter of_the test to consult
for the needed information. There is
a certain definite ratio between
amount of study and amount of play.
It is indeed a well educated student
who can balance the two so that he
can safely get to the end of the
course without tumbling off on either
one side or the other. 7

Now is a good time to make out a
little plan for the rest of the year.
How much play and how much work?
That is the question.

Not ‘March ‘
postponed till
March ?

CHIEF OS-KE-NON-TON SPEAK

‘ 0!“ INDIAN LIFE '

Bedeeked in our modest war paint
and feathers (on our hat) we timidly
approached the most modern tepee of
Chief Os-Kc-Non-Ton. For once we
were speechless. Expecting to have
our carefully curled scalp-lock pulled
In way of greeting, and a thunderous
war whoop, we were quite taken back
by a most civilized “How'do you do l"
Thrills just Kentucky-derided up and
down our spine as we shook hands
with a real live Indian with a jolly
smile and delightful sense of humor.
We racked our memory in vain for
the correct pleasantrios to say to
Indians but our memory failed us as
usual. Then we suddenly began to
feel at home, as if we had been in
the habit of calling on Indians all our
lives. We entirely forgot ourself in
listening to this man of the romantic
people as he told us tales of his first
trip to New York on eighteen dollars;
of the time he had stage fright be—

Once upon a time in the days of
long ago there was a great kingdom.
And in this kingdom there had been
established a great institution of
learning by order of the kings. At
the head of the institution was a great
wise man; and together with other
wise men he instructed the young of
the kingdom.

Now after many long weeks of
labor certain questions were given to
the young to answer. hose who
answered them WL'll remained; and
those who answered them poorly were
requested to seek advantage in other
fie ds.

Those who remained again sought
their studies with new inspiration and
burned long the midnight oil. Then
one morning when the remaining oil
in many lamps was exceeding low,

and many pupils were gathered to
hear one of the wise men, he failed
to arrive. And soon a great many
questions arose as to where the wise
man could be. Then a messenger
came and said the wise man was ill
of a great malady and would not.

rom part of those assembled arose
a cry of joy and they rushed happily
from the rooms; and from the others
arose the murmur, “And to what

And the Gods on Olympus who

eouriously at the gorgeous headdress
of many feathers and asked, “What

wer was most descriptive and satis-
fying. “Decoration which belonged to
my grandfather, on the head, to dis-
play the small pieces of hair dyed in
the blood of the enemy." We learned
that the Indians are most fond of
decorating their head-wear with hair
dyed in hostile blood. We shuddercd
and turned the discussion to war
paint and costumes.

The war paint Os-Ke-Non-Ton wore
was very vivid. It was in the form
of crimson moons surrounded by
black spikes. We made a mental note
to try the effect at some time. The
suit that he wore facinated us: it was
made of deer skin through which the
deadly bullets had passed which
caused the animal to be made into a
garment. We certainly envied the
chief his suit but we know that we
could never hope to be as handsome
in it as he.

He told us how each summer he
paddled his own canoe and lived a
real nature life among his people. He
permitted us to take into our own
hands that mysterious thing, the;

come to demand the hand .of‘your
daughter!” . .

"Demand!" exclaimed the father.
“What do you mean ?”

"Her hand, sir, the price of my
silence,” was the reply. -

The father was beside himself wit
rage and went to the telephone to
ring up the police, when theyyoung

“One moment, sir. I know nothing
of your affairs, and I do not for a
moment imagine you guilty of any
misdeed. The silence to which
allude is of another sort. I am the

"Ohl" exclaimed the father. “Take

Two colored stevedores unloading
a vessel at a dock were passing un~
complimentary remarks about each
other. Every time they met the dis-
cussron was renewed with added sar-
casm on both sides.

“Yo' jest keep on pesticating,” rc-
marked one of them, “an’ so is sho
g'wme to be able to settle a mighty
big question for do sciumtifie folks.”

“What question dot?" countered
the other.

“Kin the dead speak.”

 

_ A brawny Irishman leaned over the
big glass case in the chemist’s shop
and asked: “Wud ye plaize give me
somethin’ to kill moths?" and was
promptly supplied with a'packct of
eamphor balls.

He soon returned red with anger.
“Ar-re you the monkey-faced piece
that sowld me these balls?" shouted
the enraged one. "Just you come

One day, as little Jimmy was sitting
on the steps, a man came over to him
and asked:

“Little boy, is your mother home?"

“Yes,” was the rep y. '

The man rang the ball, but no one
answered. He rang again, but still
no one answered. After ringing a
short while he turned to Jimmy de~
spun-Ingly, and said: “Little boy, I
thought. you said your mother was

“She is, but I don't live here," was
the prompt reply.

 

Eddie Candor was telling a. friend
about a poker game he played in.
“Gee, the first put a guy calls me

“And how did you come out?” says
the friend.

An Irish recruit in the rear rank
was undergoing his ﬁrst drill. The
hard-boiled sergeant gave them
“Squads rights," and other move-
ments of similar nature. Suddenly
Pat left his squad and sat down in the
shade of a nearby tree, with the drill
sergeant yelling behind him, “How
do you get that way; who are you,

Pat disgustedly replied: "You don't
