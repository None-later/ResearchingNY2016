IS OUR EDUCATION BECOMING
NARROW

During the past few months there
has been much discussion as to what
belongs and what does not belong in
a college course. Is its purpose to
develop the intellect alone? Should
it cater only to the social life of the
individual“! Should it be an insti-
tutiun devoted only to the develop-
ment of athletics? These points have
been brought up before various inter-
ested groups at various times. They
have been answered in various ways.

The purpose of the colleges in gen-
era] is to directly prepare_ young
people for the business of life.
grammer school and in high school
the development has gone on. But
the finishing touches, the final polish-
ing of the idividual into a man or
woman capable of meeting the world
without disadvantage are left to the
colleges. Sometimes they fulfill their
purpose and sometimes they do not.

The average human is a many
sided being. He must meet his follows
on a common plane mentally, socially,
and physically. In order to justify
its existence the college must turn out
such a man or woman. This has not
been the case many times. Some
times one side is over emphasized

_ and the other neglected. For example,
if the mental man alone is trained,
the product is the narrow intellect-
ualist, the idle dreamer; if the social
man is trained without due attention
to his other needs, he becomes the
social butterfly, the tea hound; if the
phvsical man is developed exclusively,
he becomes the professional athlete,

the “ringer.”

The pendulum of opinion has
swung first to one side and then to
the other. In a professional school
like State College the mental man is
tending to become over emphasized
to the neglect of the social. Social

functions under college direction have
belcomc the exception rather than the

four black heads. Soon four stcntor-
lan voices announced that these were
“bandits bold who want people’s gold,
and knock them cold.” ’l'hen, still
more amazlnv. the four heads were
replaced by eight feet and the song
was repeated. The period of darkness
which followed was so short that
suddenly the. four bandits Were. re-

Eckerson, Catharine Woodward, and
Elise Bower. These four soon re-
appeared and showed and told ’23 and
’25 what a real flapper Was. Then
“The Moonlight Caprice,” danced
by Vivien Hart and Rena ltclyea,
concluded the program. The jazzi-
ness of the orchestra soon tempted
even the bashful out on the floor.
When the dancing Was in full swing
numbers were passed out and an
elimination dance began. The crowd
soon thinned out and when the six
couples had dwindled down to two.
then one. Edith Sanders, 23 and
Ruth Lauber, ’25 were presented with
the prize. Then the crowd once more
filled the floor and the dancing con-
tinued. Sudenly there was a lull in
the music. the scoping of the feet.
and the chatter. and a loud whisper
of “cats” caused ii wild dash for the
steps, and an equally wild dash for
ice cream and waters. The refresh-
ments having been entirely consumed
the dancing began again and con-
tinued till the lights began to go out
and the strains of “Home. Sweet
Home” filled the gym.
