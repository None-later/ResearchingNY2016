I THE COAL SHORTAGE
‘ The inmates of the K A P house
are again feeling the result of the
coal shortage. A few weeks ago
they were burning soft coal as could
plainly be seen, but now they are
out of even soft coal and there are
no chances in sight of getting any
more. Sunday morning the last
shovel full of coal was put in the
furnace with many misgivings. Mon-
day the men came to college com-
plaining of the extreme cold weather.
Certainly the K A P men will have
to spend their evenings elsewhere
until warm weather does away with
the necessity of coal.

During the last coal shortage the
men entertained several of the alumni
apparently with success. Who will
they entertain during this one?

Classes will without doubt suffer as
a result, for arising in a cold house
is apt to be more or less of a burden:
and the desire to use the allotted
number of cuts will he very hard to
combat.

It is hoped by the men that winter
will soon pass. If it does not some
are thinking of collecting coal in
baskets. Coal is scarcer now than
many other things so a warning to
guard the coal bin is not out of place.

You can keep all the kisses I gave

Youi
You can keep every golden caress;
You can keep all the sweet tricks I
taught you,
And the jokes you made me con-

You fcan keep whatsoever you care
,1—
My loving, the parties you threw;
But please send me back what I am

Missing——
The cold casli I wasted on you.
