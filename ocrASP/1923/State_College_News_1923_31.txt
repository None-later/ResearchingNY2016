will play the basket-ball five of Clark-
son on the opponent's court. The
last game of the season will be played
between State and St. Lawrence
Saturday evening, March 3. This is
also an out of town game. These
two games mark the closing of the

hard fought battles.

much further in our knowledge of
the different styles in the provinces.
So these dolls will have a value other

than just being artistic.

At 8:”: a program will be present-
ed. A 'rcat deal of care and work
has been extended in this direction,
and a fine entertainment is promised.
There will be some French l'olk danc-
ing and solo dancing. The final num-
ber on the program will be a playette
given in French which everyone will
he sure to enjoy.

All these treats have been promised
us and all we have to do is to come
ready to enjoy ourselves, not forget-
ting the trifling sum of ten cents,
which is required as an entrance fee.
Later in the evening there will be an
orchestra which in itself means a
good time. Surely with all these
inducements everyone will want to
come and have a good time.

CONTRIBUTORS COLUMN in which
he might become acquainted with the
three new authors of ’26 and the one
of ’2l. They are evidently worth
knowing.

Il‘ “writing poetry is a disease,”
we hope it is catching; for such a

we have not found between
QUARTERLY covers in a long while.
In fact, every class of this college
generation is represented, and one
more, ’22.

The “eyes of youth" as they look
out at us from this little book are
wistful, thoughtful; but as ever they
sparkle mischievoust just as we
begin to get too serious. in the form
