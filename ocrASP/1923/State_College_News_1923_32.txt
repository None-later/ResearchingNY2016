The State College basket hall five
iiiet defeat in the last two games of
the, season played with Clarkson and
St. Lawrence. State’s five were at
a disadvantage because they playc
on strange courts in both games.

At Clarkson the court was very
large and thc Clarkson five were
playing it fast game. 'l‘hey cut in,
from the corner which the State men ‘»
were unaccustomed to, and the firstl
half ended with the score 3|. and 5.‘
lluring the second half State held,l
down its end of the playing and had i
