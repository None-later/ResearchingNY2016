PAY FOR FED. BEFORE EASTER
APPRECIATION

State College is a small college, it
is true. It is equally true that “there
are those who love her." Yet, as we
rush down the balls or squeeze
through the alloys in the locker rooms
we hear remarks—~joking‘ and other-
wise—that seem to indicate that those
who truly love State are smaller than
we had anticipated.

Too many .of us come to State pre-
pared to scoff at the profession that
we are being trained for. e have
no ri rht to be here if we do not plan
to ta (2 advantage of all State can
give us and if we do not want to be
the very best ‘ty e of teacher any
teacher-training Institution in the
state can produce. State has a hi it
scholarship standard and an enviabe
reputation in the state’s professional
circles. This alone must compel our
admiration and respect.

Our faculty is one that we should
appreciate even more than we do,—
if that be possible. They are men
and women who are specialists in
their fields and are rtco nized as
such outside our own eolege com—
munity. Many of them have given
immeasurably of their time and ef-
fort to aid our interests. .

Our publications are on a par With
those of the leading colleges and um-
versities of the country. . hewvor
of the Music Association in‘bringing
chamber music to Albany is recog<
nized in our own city. The things
that the Dramatic and Art Associa-
tion has given us—from our drama-
tic class plays to the Ruth Draper
monologues—may well compel us to
view pridefully the things our college
can do. These are but examples of
the greater things State College
might accomplish if we would all
boost her—a small college, but the
best college for us in all the wars-id.

 

 

ALL OUT FOR BASEBALL

The days of basketball and foot-
ball are over for the season. Buse-
ball is going to be the sport of the
hour from April 14 till June. Busc-
ball is going to be a success if it gets
the support which S. C. T. can give
it.‘ The appropriation in dollars mill
cents has all been paid by the assoc-
iation but the appropriation in en-
thusiasm and student attendance is
yet to be paid on the instalment plan
by each member of the student body.
During the basketball season it was
easy to blame the weather or the
night air for keeping one from the
games. Almost any excuse would
serve to justify one’s staying home.

With baseball it is different. The
old excuses won’t hold very Well be-
cause baseball is an afternoon game;
it is a spring game: an out-of-doors
game. Who can resist that combi-
rution? Who wants to find excuses
for staying away from an exciting
game held in the good old out-of-
doors’! if we don't understand this
famous out door sport, now is our
chance to learn. If we do understand
it, now is our chance to take the best
kind of a “daily dozen" in the form
of a brisk walk in the open and a
good three hours of cheering for “our
side.”

OBEY THE RULES

A certain section of the interclass
rivalry rules are as follower——
Suction ll. Rupee!

1. Seniors shall mnrch' out of
Anomny before I“ other students.

2. All momlura of the Student
Body shall remain standing until all
union on out of the Auditorium.

3. Froshmon shall remain stand-
in. until the juniors and sophomores
have loft Ihoir unto.

It is unnecessary to editorialize in
order to persuade the student body to
keep these rules. They are OUR
rules, and therefore we should obey
them. The seniors are neither so
numerous or so slow in leaving the
auditorium that the rest of us cannot
wait.» In fact the sophomores and
juniors did wait—more or less—last
Friday. But in the meantime, we
are sorry to relate, as soon as the
seventy-fifth senior was about to exit,
the freshmen rushed out en masse,
ahead of both sophomores and
juniors.

Freshmen, we admire you for wait-
ing as long as you did. But even
then you broke the rules just given
you to keep. A few weeks ago seine
student commented, by way of the
“News,” that the juniors apologized
for you. There is no need for this,
’26. The cafeteria will still serve
you if you do arrive three seconds
later. Obey the rules,———Freshmcnl

Sophomores! Juniors!

'l‘wo Kansas farmers met at Long
Beach on a winter vacation and were
discussing their native State. Each
claimed his county was the worst in
the world for wind storms. 'l‘hen
along came a man from Ohio who
settled the argument by telling of a
terrible cyclone that had crossed his
own farm some years back. He said:

“Gentlemen, one day they come a
cyclone iierost my farm back in
Washington County that blowed my
well plumb outa the ground and laid
her in my neighbor’s yard, and when
I come over to git it next day he had
sawed it up for post holes, and was
usin’ it puttin' up his fence."

They had just been married and
everybody was still making a fuss
when he who is “only the groom,”
with a rather unsteady gait and a
decidedly painful face, wormed his
way through the crowd to the min-
ister.

“Mr. White, there’s a question
that's burdening my mind horribly.
Would you be so kind as to answer
it?"

“Certainly! I shall be delighted!”

“I believe, if I remember right,
that you said something, some time
to-night about making us one."

“That is true. And the question?”

“I would like to know which one."

 

“Friend,” said Cactus Joe to the
stranger in Crimson Gulch. “you have
held four of a kind three times, a
roval flush twice. an’ several ace
falls.”

“Lucky, I call it.”

Sandy MziePherson had driven a
beautiful ball straight; down the fair-
way for 275 yards. He was now con~
fronted with a babbling little stream
which he must cross to reach the

green, seventy-five yards away. He
called his caddie iind selected the
inashie from his bag of clubs. With

a cool and deliberate aim he. took it
terrific swing. The ball sailed
through the air, across the stream,
and landed dead three feet from the
bin.

Sandy fairly danced across the
brook, singing: “'l‘he brook, the
brook, the bonnie babbling brook!
May it never run dry!"

Coming to the same stream on the
second round, Sandy had the ident—
ical ‘shot ‘to make. Selecting his
innshie again he took a mighty walln i
The ball spurtcd, bounced from rock
to’ rock, and finally landed in the
middle of the brook.

' Sandy watched it forlornly settle
istelf in the bottom of the stream and
then turned to his caddie and said:

‘Son, go down there and get my
ball out of that dirty sewer.”

 

The Dean was exceedingly angry.

“So you confess that this unfor—
tunate young man was carried to the
pond and drenched? Now, what part
did you take in this disgraceful
affair?"

“The right leg. sir," answered the
sophomore meekly.—Johns Hopkins

She was in a telephone booth and
had JLlSl} put in a toll roll. She went
bitterly as she pulled down on the

“Hello?” came Central’s clear
