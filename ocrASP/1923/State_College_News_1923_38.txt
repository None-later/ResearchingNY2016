sufficient variety to please the most
exacting critic.

Lively discussion has taken place
among the students, showing that
they are interested in musical ques-
tions. A comparison of the ’l‘rio with
the l.th Quartet is made in many
cases. Some vote for the former,
seine for the later. However. judg—
ing from the applause and from the
faces of the audience, nobody was
disappointed. On the contrary, from
Schubert to Grieg the extraordinary
dexterity, imagination and talent of
the artists were recognized and en-
joyed. It is a privilege to have heard
the finest of American trios and the
finest American string (martet in the
same season. '

G. A. A. ARANGES FOR FROLIC

There will be a gym. frolic next
Thursday, March 11'), at which those
present will witness a basket ball
game between the A.B.’s and B.S.‘s.
Last year the scientists defeated the
scholars probably because they are
naturally technically-minded. But as
one cannot live on reputation it is
surmised that the B. S’s will not
have altogether “white collar” jobs

We anticipate a large crowd next
Thursday and a good time for every-
one. The frolic affords an excellent
opportunity for getting acquainted
with folks when they are “off their
dignity.” We suggest that all the
likable and worth while girls of col-
lege do not belong to your set. Come
and get acquainted with some of the
others.

The G. A. A. offers an opportunity

for under classmen to do their little ._

bit in swelling the Dormitory Fund.
Surely when the seniors are so gener-
ously burdqning ,tliemselrcs with
pledges, We shall not hesitate to buy
a tag next Friday when G: A. A.
members ask for ' a contribution
toward raising their quota for‘our

new residence. . .-
