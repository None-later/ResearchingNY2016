ence Dickinson, organist of the Brick
Presbyterian Church, Union Sealin-
ary and Temple Beth-El. New York;
'1‘. ’I‘ertius Noble, organist of St.
Thomas' Church, New York; and

The organ is the work of the Casa-

the, Quebec, a firm that has an inter-
national reputation. The nearest

the First Baptist Church, Syracuse.

The new instrument is five instru-

cated at the right of the chancel, con-
taining the deep-toned pipes, played
from the board of the console. The
swell, solo, and choir organs are in
separate rooms above the arch of the
chancel, all played from the one con-
sole.

At the recital on March 12, the
Iollowinp; program was enjoyed by
the members of the student body and
faculty who were fortunate enough
to be able to attend.
