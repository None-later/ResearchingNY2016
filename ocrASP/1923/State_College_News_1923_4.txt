 ENTURY after century

/ men broke their necks
trying to fly. They had
not troubled to discovcr
what Solomon called “the way cf
an eagle in the air."

In 1891 came Samuel Pierpont
Langley, secretary of the Smith-
sonian Institution. He wanted
facts. His ﬁrst step was to whirl
ﬂat surfaces in the air, to measure
the air pressures required to sus~
tain these surfaces in motion and
to study the swirls and currents Of
the air itself. Finally, in 1896, he
built a small steam-driven model
which ﬂew three-quarters of a
mile.

With a Congressional appro-
priation of $50,000 Langley built
a large man-carrying machine. Be-
cause it was improperly launched,
it dropped into the Potomac River.
Years later, Glenn Curtiss ﬂew it
at Hammondsport, New York.

Congress regarded Langley's
attempt not as a scientiﬁc experi-
ment but as a sad ﬁasco and

refused to encourage him further.
He died a disappointed man.

Langley's scientiﬁc study which
ultimately gave us the airplane
seemed unimportant in 1896.
Whole newspaper pages were given
up to the sixteen-to-onc ratio of
silver to gold.

“Sixteen-rmone" is dead polit.
ically. Thousands of airplanes
cleave the air~—airplanes built
with thevknowlcdge that Langley
acquired. V

In this work the Laboratories of
the General Electric Company
played their part. They aided in
developing the “supercharger,”
whereby an engine may be sup-
plied with the air that it needs for
combustion at altitudes of four
miles and more. Getting the facts
ﬁrst, the Langley method, made
the achievement possible.

What is expedient or important
today may be forgotten tomorrow.
The spirit of scientiﬁc research
and its achievements endure.
