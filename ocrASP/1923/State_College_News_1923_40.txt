ALBANY. NIH-Y. MARCH 23. I923

H. W. Rockwell Addresses
Student Body

Opportunities in Teaching in a
Profession Discuued
Assembly on Friday, March 16,

proved to be a most interesting and
inspiring period. Dr. Brubucher in
troduced Mr. Harry W. Rockwell,
Principal of the Bull'ulo State Nor-
mal School whose attractive person-
ality and magnetic appeal are best
comprehended by his words.

He first congratulated each stud-
ent of State College for being a part
of a great institution which affords
a unique training in our chosen pro-
'ssion. Mr. Rockwell went on to
say: “Why is it that Boston is con-
sidered the center of educational
training? Because the freshmen en~
tering Harvard bring so much know-
ledge with them and take so little
away." “There is a rare and happy
trinity of preparation in the curricu-
lum at State College: first there is
a background of cultural subjects;
second, there is special attention
given to subjects studied in the hiin
school; third, there are facilities
which afford training in the techni-
que of teaching.”

“There are many interesting feat—
ures that allure and attract one into
the teaching profession. For instance
the hours of a teacher are compara-
tively easy. The teacher’s year con—
sists of 200 work days with 105 for
mental refreshment and physical re-
creation. Then too, the great privi-
lege of future mental growth is af-
forded those in the teaching profes-
sion, a privilege not possessed to such
a degree in the other professions.
Our degree does not mark the end
of scholastic training but rather sig-
nifies the entrance upon the road of
further development."

Aml then we heard the amusing
story of the two alternatives which
Mr. Rockwell applied to our life work
“In the teaching profession there are
also two alternatives: first, stagna-
tion; second, future growth. Do not
adopt the complacant notion of self-
suffieiency and be content to rest on ‘
the oars, satisfied with your develop-’
ment. There is no such thing as a
finished teacher. There is always
something beyond—else what is
Heaven for?”

 

The splendid variety offered in the
teaching profession was then pointed
out. The teacher experiences eight to ‘
ten thousand different reactions in
her pupils just during one day. As to

State to Open Baseball
Season With Albany “Y”

OPPONENTS WILL HAVE
STRONG TEAM

 

 

On April [It the baseball season
for State College will open by a
game with the Y. M. C. A. of Albany.
This game has a twofold interest; it
is the first one of the number sched-
uled, and it is to be played on the
home diamond.

The Y. M. C. A. has put out; some
good teams in the past and in spite
of the fact that the men are chang-
ing every year will undoubtedly put
out a fast team this season. The
team is composed of men staying in
C. A. dormitory. ’I‘h‘ese
men come, to a large extent, from
the law, pharmacy and business col-
lege, and so the chance of picking a
nine composed of all good players is
very good as compared with that of
State, whose small number of men

,.

 

makes it very difficult to find players
who have had much previous exper-I
ience. I

The game, coming as it does sol
soon after the beginning of practice,
means some good hard work on the
part of State’s nine, but with some
hard practice State should be ablel
to put out a good fast team with
which to meet the Y. M. C. A. nine.

 

MARTHA LOMAX ELECTED
FROSH PRESIDENT

The freshman class held a meeting
last Friday afte‘ assembly to elect
a new president in the place of John
Lalor. There were two candidates
up for the office; Martha bomax and
Joseph Howard. When the ballots
were counted it was fouan that Miss
Lomax was elected by a majority of
votes.

The matter of banner rivalry was
also discussed. It was decided to
give back the sophomore banner in
return for the freshman banner.
This seemed to be the only satisfact-
ory way to settle the matter as no
chance was to be offered to get back
the banners, class rivalry having been
forbidden by Myskania.
