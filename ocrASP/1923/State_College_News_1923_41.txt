WHAT DO YOU THINK OF THE
NEWS

During the present year the
“News” has been trying to give the
best service to State College students
and alumni. The events and notes
of interest have been brot to the
attention of its readers each week.
We think we are improving the news-
paper that represents State, but we
cannot be sure that we are accom-
plishing all that is possible if we do
not hear from the student body.

There are many ways in which
interested criticism will do a great

'deal to make the “News” still better.

Suggestions as to arrangement and
content will always be gladly receiv-
cd. If there is something that you
would like to have printed send it in
and it will be printed provided it has
sufficient interest for the whole stud-
ent body. In order to be progressive
the general make-up of the paper
must improve as time goes on. If you
will help, the “News” will be pro-
pressive.

 

The “New” wishes everyone a moat
pleasanl vacation.

STATE COLLEGE NEWS, MARCH 23. l923

 

STUDENT COMMENT

 

 

 

 

ARE YOU WORTHY OF MEMBER-
SHIP INTHE STUDENT BODY OF

AMERICA
-Wc, as college students, are apt to
be rather proud of that term

“Student Body” as it is so often
applied. “The student body of
America" etc has a pleasant ring in
our cars. It ﬂutters us and satisﬁes
a certain part of our ego—and there-
fore we use it pridefully and fre-
quently. And yet, I wonder how
many of us, members of the student
body of State College, if we were
given a chance to observe, would be
terribly proud of ourselves if we saw
ourselves when we had what per—
haps can be called our “company
manners" on.

Speakers come to our college and
what do they see? They see the stu-
dents stragglc in one by one or two
by two, leisurely, and sometimes
boisterously. They see those some
students rise sort of meanly and with
that air of resigned impatience that
only the college student with all his
self esteemed, superior knowledge
can register, when the seniors march
in; with perhaps the last underclass—
man pulling himself languidly to his

feet as the last few seniors take their!

places. In fact, I doubt if the speak-
cr can be terribly proud of the dig-
nified seniors. They struggle in, some
with partners some without, with
scarcely any attempt to come any-
where near being in step with the
music; and the resulting effect is a
sort of gainloss stroll with a hitch
here and there as one gowned worthy
attempts to catch up with another.

And then, these same speakers
hear us sing our Alma Mater. Rath-
er they hear a portion of us sing
parts here and there. I don’t think
there is ever a place in the Alma
Mater. where we are all singing.
Most of us have at least managed to
cram into our already heavily bur-
dened heads the few lines at the last,
but when it is time to sing them
half of our worthy assemblage are
attempting explanations of absences
from their seats when the roll was
taken or trying to make arrange-
ments with someone on the sopho-
more side to hurry down and get
lunch at the close of the period; and
by the time they are ready to sing,
the other half has apparently ex-
hausted itself and has retired to the
meek and gentle work of humming
or singing words here and there.
Practically every Friday I watch
students do this same thing over and
over again.

And, almost invariably, a lot of
us have Spanish to ﬁnish for that
12:15 or Latin or something else to
get done that seems important and
so. we let our courtesy go to satisfy
those mighty powers who make such

 

 

heavy demands upon us. I admit it

7 behooves us to react to the pressing

lnot more than eight pages, acknow-

demands of our profs—before thclledging such little things as boxes

reaction reverses to ourselves, but I
doubt very much if we would be any
the worse off if we submitted our-
selves to the topics of the moment
and listened courteously to the
speaker. We jabber our best jokes
and enthusiastically grasp and give
in return specks and bits of the lat-
est gossip at the time when the
speaker standing before us can look
down and judge us as we listen be-
fore him.

You aren’t supprlscd to see inter-
mediates or high school students do
this sort of thing, but college stu-
dents should be above that. Wc as
students of State College ought to be
too big to let anyone get the impres-
sion that we are only languidly in-
terested in the collective activities of
our college and ought to be too
proud to lower the standard of our
college manners by doing triﬂing
things when big things are at hand.
It is just as easy to get up in uni-
son as to do it singcly when the seni-,
ors march in. We have to get up
any way so why not all get up on our
feet together.

Every time we go to chapel we are
representing collectively the student
body of America. Are we making
it a desirable student body? a cour-
teous one? a worthwhile one?

The problem rests with each indi-
vidual; the question is are you being
the kind of a student who is worthy
of membership in that great institu-
tion, the Student Body of America?

SKATE SKOLLEGE
March 23, 1923
Sweet Clementine :
An announcement!

No, Clem, not my engagement but
a real one! I am going home to-
night! Seven whole weeks of grind-
ing since mid-years (the horrid
things) and now ten days of peace.
Ten days, just think of it, Clem, in
which to sleep and eat things that
Mrs. McCoochey never could cook,
and most of all nothing to do!

I guess its rather fortunate for
me that there is to be a vacation for
I’ve been almost ill lately. A new
kind of disease—Spring Fever, they
call it. Yes, I’ve got it. ﬁnd it for
two weeks. I never wanted to do
less or cut more classes in my life'
but tonight I’m going home.

I haven’t prepared one thing for
today. It doesn't matter though for
the profs don't expect it. It wouldn’t
do them any good if they did, for I
had to pack last night. And just im-
agine studying math. when you can
hear the spring water sloshing under
rubber tires on the state roads to-
morrow afternoon.

I'm not going to write any letters,
not even to you during vacation no,
not one—except. Well of course

 

one might have to write brief notes,

 

 

m ' ~~~> ban-bur. WWW!!!“ wmvx. , and»... .V. ,.

of candy and so forth.

And oh Clem, of course you
know Cornell vacation doesn’t conn
the same time ours docs. Isn’t it a
shame? 26 and that maple sugar?

By the way Clem, did you know
that Union vacation doesn’t begin
until next Friday and R. P. I. hasn't
any at all? Never mind we SitOlllI‘.
come back to college rested at am
rate. '

And oh Clem, do you remcmbi-i
There's the bell for my last eta...
and then I’m going home. 1’“ writi-
just as I come back, and tell you all
I did and—thats all.

Till then,
JOSEPHINE

 

P.S.—Morc later.

DORMITORY FUND NEWS
Of interest to those of us who
are working for the dormitory iunu

~is the following letter telling- of Lh:

work of Augusta Knapp, '22, llnp,
Persons, ’22 and Elvinn Watl<in-:.
ex ’18.

My dear Mr. Saylesr—

At the annual meeting and lunch
eon of the Hudson Valley Branch of
the State College Alumni Assoeizr
tion, it was suggested that the Stair
College graduates who were teaching
at any place should co-operate to
raise money for the Dormitory Fund.
Accordingly, Elvina Watkins who at-
tended State Collogc 1914 — 15, Hope
Persons ’22 and I, who are teaching
here at Highland decided to try to
help a little bit.

A few weeks ago we three took
part in a play given by an orginiza»
tion of the church where we attend.
At our request the play was repeated
and half the proceeds given to us
for the Dormitory Fund. Although
our share of the proﬁts of the last
performance amounted to only twcn<
ty~one dollars, we hope that it will
be a slight help in swelling the
Dormitory Fund. I am enclosing the
check for the twenty-one dollars.
We hope to be able to do more in the
future to help increase the Fund.

Very respectfully yours,
AUGUSTA KNAPP, ’22

Professor Sayles has appointed
Dorothy Bonnet, ’24 and Ethel Cum—
mings, ’23 as a committee for work-
ing out a clever scheme to keep State
College informed of the progress 01'
the work of the Dormitory commit-
tees. The plan is this:——’[‘hc com-
mittee will draw a huge tree with
several branches. As the pledge to
the Fund come in the tree will be
shaded with some color to show the
amount pledged. As the pledges are
paid the color will be made darker
to show the actual money received.
'Ihe money and pledges received re-
present thc saps of life for the tree
and as they increase and the sup goes
up.through the tree to the branches
which began to bear fruit and leaves
to.sh?w the increased amount rc—
