H. W. ROCKWELL ADDRESSES
STUDENT BODY
(Continued from page 1)
the professional status of the teacher
Mr. Rockwell said: “We are develop-
ing a real professional spirit. He
who knows what and how to do a
thing is a mere craftsman but he who
knows the why and wherefore of
that action is a professional worker.
Thus we call ourselves professional
workers. The fact that so many teach
era are pursuing extension work in
the summer is evidence of improve-
ment in the professional spirit of
teachers." By actual statistics Mr.
Rockwell established his point and
went on to quote Dr. Brubacher as
saying “By our personal attitude we
can raise the professional standard
A member of the legal or medical
profession may be inefficient without
alarming results to humanity, but if
a member of the teaching profession
be inefficient, truth itself is sacri
ficed and with a sacrifice of that oui

very civilization is stalled.”
“Therefore let us go into teaching
with the spirit and the desire or
service to our fellowmen. May we
filled with the desire to serve and
spend ourselves to the utmost, anr‘
with a glad optimistic spirit, like
that of Rupert Brooke, thank ‘Gorl
who has matched us for this hour.
Then Mr. Rockwell summed up the
aims of the teaching profession.-
further developement of ourselves-
service to our fellowmen, achieve-
ment of great things, and the eleva‘.‘
ion of our professional status. A";
a conclusion he quoted that famou.
editorial passage in reference tu
teachers: “The future of the race r.
in our hands but there can be no sai-
vation of that ruci unless we strike
from the brain ignorance, from th4
heart superstition, and from the hant‘.

 

the curse of too little skill.”
