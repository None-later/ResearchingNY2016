DR. THOMPSON GIVES INTER-
ESTING TALK ON BOOKS OF
BIBLE . H ‘

On Monday, March 19, Dr. Thomp-
son gave an address in the auditor-
ium on "Wisdom Books of the Bible."
In the old testament such books can
especially be found. By a wisdom
book is meant a book containing the
observations of human life and con-
duct made by an old man of world
experience. Such men, who tried to
teach the younger generation proper
conduct, were termed wise men.
Among the Jews all art and learning
and religion was connected with con-
duct. And so these wise old men of
Jerusalem would collect outside the
city gates and pour forth their theo-
ries of life to the young, gathered
around them. Later their sayings
were put in book-form such, for ex-
ample, us the Book of Proverbs. The
Book of Proverbs is not a religious
book but a book which mixes religion,
ethics, and business. Theories of
education Lll‘i' given in it, as shown
in the verse “He that spnretli the rod
hateth his son —but he that chastizeth
him lovuth him.” This wise man who
was responsible for the book of Pro-
verbs gives his ideas of political and
social life , shows faint gleums of
humor and even displays a knowledge
of women—~shown by the verse "It
is better to dwell in a dessert land

than with a contentious and frettish
woman." Observations on character
and faith are made by him, but his
most beautiful observation is the one
on friendship; “As in water face
unswercth to face, so the heart of
man to man." And so the book of
Proverbs is a book of shrewd obser-
vations made by a man, wlioexpresses
these observations as his doctrine in
life.

The Book of Ecclesiastes is
another wisdom book of the Bible,
but more beautiful and of a higher
type. The wise author of this book
is trying to «liscovor whether he can
find satisfaction in life through
studying the mysteries of life and
solving its problems. The more the
man studies the more perplexed he
becomes, and finally he concludes
the best thing to do is to live the
best he can and leave the problems
of life to God. His duty, he decides,
is to “Fear God and keep his com-
mandments.” And so, throughout
the Bible, particularly in the old
testament, can be found these books
expressing doctrines of life, formed
by aged men of experience.
