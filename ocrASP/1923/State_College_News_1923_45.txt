loianomax Lectures on

Negro Ballads

Sings Cowboy Ballads On Request

Friday night, April (3, in the Col-
ledgc auditorium. Mr. John Loinnx
gave an informal, instructing, and
highly amusing talk on the religious
ballad of the. negi'os‘. He gave a
short history of the customs, the
repressions, the longings of the col-
ored people, their idea of religion
and their ways of cxpi. ssing these
things in tune and chant.

'l‘hc negro's idea of religious top-
ics, suitable for song, centered about
the glory of Heaven and the terror
of Hell. l‘larthly conduct of man
and his earthly obligations were of
little inspiration to the preacher or
his Liinel'ul congregation.

Iliiptism was a favored subject for
song. “I wont to de riber to get
baptized, Slipped on (in log and gets
capsized!" expresses the sentiments
of one of the humorous baptismal
ballads.

Ol'tiines there would be a leader
who would sing the main theme of
the song while the chorus of a few
words would be repeated by the con-
gregation il‘ sung in church.

“You come to my house

And drink my tea'

You go to my no 'I
And tall: about me."
rhyme is one of the many
stanzas of a song which deals with
morals.

Mr. Loinax sang several of the
ballads including one of the Eric
canal. In conclusion he gave a cow-
boy's yeodle and made us join in the
chorus of a rollicking cowboy song.

There was an exceedingly and
mysteriously 'foroshoi'tened dance
in the gymnasium after the concert
to the delight of those who had pa—
tience. enough to wait for it.

Dormitory Fund

TO BE INTRODUCED BY
DR. RICHARDSON

’l‘he lilastern llranch of the Alumni
Association will present Miss Agnes
[“ut , a dramatic reading on
Friday evening, April .13, in (Than-
cellors' llall. Miss li‘utterer has
chosen for her interpretation cuttings
from "’l'he Adini'able Crichton,’l a
four act drama. by Sir James M.
liar“ ’l‘his play, which was staged
by last year’s D 'ainatics Class and re-
ceived with great favor, has an
English setting. lts chief characters
consist of three sisLers of noble
ltinglii‘h birth, their father, their suit—
ors. their maid and their biitler——\vlio
turns out to be the admirable (.‘rich-
ton by proving his worth to the
family when they are wrecked on an
island in taking a sea voyage. Lady
Mary, one of the daughters, finds
herself fast falling in love with the
Admirablc Crichton on the island, but
when she has reached England in
safety she realizes the lliipossibility
of marrying her butler.

As well as being interesting, the
play shows the futility of striving to
‘riso above the caste in which one is
born in l‘illg‘lllnil, regardless of how
intelligent or capable the climber
iniiy be.

It is expected that all college stu-
dean will attend the reading not
only as a test of their patriotism,
since it is to be a benefit to swell
the dormitory fund—what to show
their ability to appreciate something
really fine, for those who have heard
Miss l<‘iitterer know how ably shi-
interpreted “Lady Windemei'e’s ll‘illl”
“Monsieur Beaucaire,” “’l‘he ’l‘welve
l’ound Look," “Rosalind” and
“Quality Street.”

The Eastern Branch of the Alumni
Association has undertaken to under—
write the Dormitory Drive Campaign
so that none of the money pledged
for the dormitory need be spi ‘
publicity—and Miss Futtcrer has gen-
erously given a reading each year
for this purpose. 'l‘ickets for her

Miss Futterer To Read For! Nominations ForStuilent C'Haiiiiltou Quartet Sings For

Women’s Club

At the special request of Dr.
’l‘hoinpson, the Hamilton Quartet,
which was scheduled to give a con-
cert that evening at the Vhic-nitiaii
Institute, under the auspices of the
Hamilton Alumni Association, con~
seated to sing before the Women‘s
Chorus, Wednesday, April II. in
spite of slight embarrassmezit in the
presence of so many young ladies,
the four young llli'li found enough
courage to sing on original song eu-
titled “Women”. ’l‘he audience was
so amused and entertained that they
immediately demanded more. The
quartet then sang several selections,
and when three of the members \\'I'i'l'
forced to rest, the tenor soloist, Mr.
'l‘huinpson, sang a lovely song of
“love and roses" which was so ap-
pi'ecniteil that he tenderly and iill'ec-
tively sang a little love song to oin-
of the young ladies in the audieiee.
'l'he quartet tlion attempted to claw
their program by ii beautiful rendi-
tion (it"‘chet iind liow", but no
sooner had they made their esr: ,ii-
trom the platform than Dr. 'I‘homp-
son appeared, and requested them
to sing their Alma Mater. So, \\‘ll.ll
Dr. ’I‘hompson accompanying, the
quartet treated the State (lolling
students present not only to some
splendid singing. but also to a line
exhibition of college spirit.
