SAVE THE GRASS

There has been much discussion
among student groups for the past
year in regard to the appearance of
paths across the campus. There was
a time not so long ago when the
lawns about college were commented
upon for their beauty. But during
the past year, paths have appeared
across them. While a great deal of
trespassing is due to the public and
to grammar school children, college
people do not hesitate to use a short
out whether they are in a hurry or
not.

Now is a good time to use the con-
crete walks exclusively. The fresh
grass is just making its appearance
and if trampled upon will be killed
and cannot grow for the rest or the
summer. If the people who attend
college refrain from this bad habit,
others less interested may stop also
At any rate the paths will be less
deeply worn.

 

STATE COLLEGE NEWS. APRIL I3. l923

 

A WORD FOR ED. 13
It is the last of the term. A group

of Seniors are “hashing it over."
From the conversation we snatch
the following extracts: I hate to give
up my class. Don't you think that the
pupils are interesting? I love every
person in my class. 01' you hear the
said group discussing with much
mirth the escapades of the now fa-
mous “Tom Brown”.

As frosh we conceived one of two
ideas of Ed. 13: either that it was
going to be a grand lark or the op-
portunity for each of us to show our
separate and individual prowess, an
opportunity to make the Milne High
pupils think that we are the best
teachers ever and an opportunity to
make critics fairly stand agape with
wonder at the tact with which our
untrained minds handle disciplinary
and educational problems.

I Welliecame sophomores. Our Jun-
iors sisters pass‘on to the joys of
1’. T’s. We begin to hear at? “Wars
and rumors of Wars”. Even our
Joyous Junior year is partially dim-
inc-d by the thought of the impend~
Ing perils which are made more vivid
by animated descriptions of little
boys With horns, critics with their
ultimatums, and teasing, giggling,
frivolous girls. At last we are sen—
iors. During those first few dread-i
lul days we have those spasmodicl
moments when our minds are blank,
our tongues clove to the roofs oipur
mouths, and our auditory'scnsations
fail to connect With our intellectual
centers all because the critic has un-
obtousively opened the class room
door. Gradually we become accus-
tomed to rcpartec critics and con-
ferences. Then we begin to enjoy
our classes so much that we wonder
how that gripping dread of it ever
)ossesscd our‘souls. We begin to
lame the seniors who preceded us
and to question their reasons for
fastening upon us'all the horrors of
the course while miniinIZing the amu-
sing and pleasant Sllle. Let us as
seniors and as a student body make
the precedent to eliminate that over-
due dislike for practice teaching
which is really after all nothing more
than one of the liveliest, most inter—
(35tan educational courses that we
have in college.

tell greater lies than their neighbors.

miles, had been admitted into the
