Freshmen. Present Stunt

 

CHEER AND SONG LEADER
TRYOUTS

 

'l‘he Freshman stunt, which con-
sisted of a “two act play in two acts”
entitled “A Modern Day in King
Tut’s Court" was put on in Assembly
Friday morning, April .13. The first
scene depicted the throne room in
which was assembled Old King Tut,
his attendants and his harem—with
his favorite sittin -' at his knee. Old
King Tut was any played by Mr.
Haight, while Margaret Flanagan, as
Cleopatra and Mark Antony’s pledged
lady, basked in the glory of the
King’s favoritism. The King’s wor-
thy attendants, Harry Godfrey and-

arion Landon. stood on guard at'
the sides of his throne, waving palm
leaves over his head, while the ladies‘
of his harem reclined on soft cush-
ions. Jenettc Manville, Olla Goewey,
Miriam Snow, Marjorie Bellows,
Muriel Wenzel, Zelma German and
Helen Barclay constituted the king’s
household. Oriental costumes, soft
pillows, burning incense, and red
roses added to the " '
the scene, while modern slang and‘
ways of vamping aroused the laugh-
ter of the upper classmen. nl
Isiuyptian dance in solo by Mary;
Flanagan proved very entertaining as
well as one by [late Shopmeier and
Jeanette Wright, which showed their
talent in skipping the light fantastic
in Oriental style.

The second scene, consist'ng of
the same setting as the first, was
made amusing by a trick handker-
chief which hopped around in a mys—
terious fashion aml made everyone
wonder just how it was manipulated
until a string attachment was dis-
covered. Adaline Sohns and Percy
Briggs rendered a jazzy violin duct,
giving proof that the present day
music can claim some relations With
that of olden times—and thenvmthe
curtain fell.

Mary Flanagan was the author and
producer of the playlet.

Previous to the stunt there was a
try-out for next year's song leader.
The Freshmen try-outs were Helen

I
MISS FUTTERER GIVES PLEAS-i
INC. INTERPRETATION OF “THE;
ADMIRABLE CRICHTON" l

 

 

 

_‘ l
Dramatic: Clnu Plans Play 

 

Friday night, April lit, in Chan-l
cellars l'lall, Miss Agnes Futterer
gave a most charming and deceptive
reading of Sir James M. Barrie’s
play, The Admirable Crichton, for
the benefit of the Dormitory Fund.
The reading was deceptiVe in that,
it gave the impression of a complete—;
ly set stage peopled by the distinctlyl
different characters of the play. 1

The story of the super perfect but—l
lcr in an aristocratic English house-r
hold; the trick of fate which wrecked
the fainin on a desert island and re-
versed the social position of Lord
Lome and Crichton, the butler; the
return to civilization and the old or-
der of things make the play itself
an amusing and interesting one. Miss
Futterer, with the aid of three chairs,
a table, and her voice and gestures
created for the audience the digni—
fied person of Crichton, the pomp-
ous Lord Lome. the bored LadyMary,
the cringing ’I‘weeney and the epigra-
matic Ernest. She was the play in
herself, a most enchanting and lovely
play which lasted all too short a time
for the delighted audience.

 

The Dramatics’ Class. under Miss
Futterer’s direction, will present the
play "The White Headed Boy" on
May 26, in the Vincentian Institute.
The play is a quaint Irish comedy
which affords great opportunity to
the characters. The cast is not yet
complete but promises to be an ex-,
cellent one. ‘

Baseball Season Opens
Saturday

STATE MEETS UNION AT
RIDGEFIELD

 

 

On Saturday, April 21, State will
play its first scheduled baseball game
of the season with Union at ltidge-
field. The game with the Albany
Y. M. C. A. was not played, but a
game with Albany High took its place
Albany High did most of its scoring
in the first two innings, and State
piled up its scores in a bunch during
the fourth and fifth innings. While
the game showed good playing on the
part of both teams it also gave them
an opportunity to pick out their weak
points. The game ended with a tie
score of 6—6.

The game was an excellent practice
game for State before playing Union.
While no definite
given for Saturday’s game, the pros-

line-up can be

pects are as follows: For the infield--
Sage, McMann, Caton, Rude, Cassa-
vant, Stahlman, and Daley. For the
outfield—Smith, Cole, Crane, Davis,
Roberts, and Snyder. For the pitch—
crs there will be Gainer, Caton and
Casarette, with Anderson in the
catcher’s box.

The freshmen men on the team
have all had experience on High
School teams and the upperclassmen
have had experience either on College
or Normal teams.

Tax tickets admit college students
to the game. This is the first game
of the season. It is also a home
game, and the support of the whole
student body is desired.
