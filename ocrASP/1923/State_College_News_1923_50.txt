A REQUEST

We wish our contributors would
realize that in order to get their
"News" out on time each Friday, it
is necessary for all material intended
for publication to be in the office
before the Monday noon’ previous.
In this way more time can be given
to the makeup of the paper.

If sorority and club reporters will
try to get their notes in on time, the
editors and printers can give more
careful attention to arrangement and
composition. We trust that this will
be kept in mind. Can we have your
cooperation?

 

STATE COLLEGE NEWS, APRIL 20. 1923

 

STUDENT COMMENT

COLLEGE SPIRIT vs BARBARISM

In assembly on Friday, represent~
atives of the class of '26 entertained
the student body by an interesting
stunt. We believe that the fresh
inerlt much praise and commendutory
encouragement for their initial ap-
pearance before State College. If
they are able to maintain the repu-
tation gained by Friday's perfor-
mance thruout their collegiate course.
they will surely attain the high water
mark of success socially. Note par-
ticularly that there was no slam or
even the slightest derogatory remark
against their traditionally inimical
rivals of '25. There was nothing
antagonistic or challenging in the
entire stunt—it was just a piece of
good fun and jolly humor presented
for the entertainment and amusement
of the student body.

Just as the curtain was being
drawnon the last act of the perfor-
mance, there was hurled from a. cer-
tain section of the auditorium a great
deluge of cabbage, grapefruit,
onions, books and so forth. In-
stantly the warriors behind the cur-
tains charged with full force and the
loaded (with juice!) missiles came
whizzing back thru the air, bespatter-
ing the floor and seats with pulp,
juice, and seeds. The innocent suf-
fered with the guilty, for even the
non-combatants sustained a wrecky
spoilation of armor in the guises of
dresses. After a further discharge
of weapons from both armies, the
participating legion on the auditor-
ium flank of the trench, which con-
sisted of the curtain, made one wild
rush for the exit and dashed out on
top speed, hardly delaying to hurl
back the scattered instruemcnts of
attack. And it all happened so quick-
ly and unexpectedly that the student
body was at first hardly conscious
of the proceedings. Then it became
aware of the conflict and immediately
there arose a great commotion.
Everyone jumped up and rushed
toward the scene of action, uttering
cries of exclamation and astonish-
ment at the hurlers of onions and
cabbagesl Then there was much
pointing to a particular spot on the
wall above the platform, much wide-
eyed expression, and a great deal of
discussion among the women as they
gazed at the offensive, ugly stain of
fruit juice raised to such a lofty and
conspicuous position by the results
of vegetarian warfare. Thus even
our assembly bears the marks of
Vicious operations.

May we ask first; was such con-
duct fair to the sophomore class? It
was neither indulged in nor sane-'
tioned’ by the concerted action of
that class. Was it fair that a group
of individuals should disturb and dis-
rupt the entire student body? And
was such lawless behavior fair to the
dictates of Myskania? Did it svm-
bolize respect for or obedience to the
rulings of our governing organiza-
tion to preserve law and order in the
college community? Finally is such
vehement and unkindly action includ-
ed in that great code which consti-t
tutes college spirit? No! ! ! '21

    

 

 

 

 

A FABLE.

Once upon a time in the days of
long ago, there were a great many
young men and maidens gathered
unto a great institution of learning.
Now these many people were divided
unto four great classes at this great
institution, and each class, according
to custom, was requested to produce
a play for the benefit and amusement
of their fellows. ‘

The oldest class presented their
play, and there was naught but up-
plausc among the assembly“ The
next oldest class presented theirs with
a similar result.

Now it came time for the next
youngest class to give their play and
the young men of the very youngest
class, feeling it their duty to give a
new form of aplnusc to their rival
class, went down to the beach and
gathered many small pebbles. And
after the play had been given the

SERIOUS THOTS '

The last lap of the race is before
us, the final warning gong was rung
on Thursday last, and the most lag-
g'iird of the entrants knows that the
time has come. when he must put
forth his best effort—or be left he-
hind at the finish. Of course, each
of us reacted differently to this
knowledge according as his age, class
and general record of work accom-
plished varied. .

To the seniors, who have covered
much the same course titrce previous
times, this gong meant u number of
things; it acted as u fore-announcer
of the fact that their play-days are
almost at. an end. and that short in-
deed is the time before another per-
iod of their life will be definitely
rounded out. And such is the per-
versity of human nature, that al-
though they have spent four long
years in preparing themselves for
entrance into this, the “derby” of
educational fields, they am not now
totally happy at seeing the goal so
near at hand. The coveted gold seal
with all that: for which‘ it stands,l
does not seem quite so desirable now, i
as it (lid four years ago, in view ofl
all that must be renounced to
attain it.

To the juniors, this warning meantl
that an added burst of vigor applied'
immediately to their “ed” theses
would be very apropos. The sopho-
mores gave an indifferent shrug in
the direction of '26, as though to
signify how impossible it would be
for anyone to think such superior
beings as they need take heed—and
then began privately to brush up on
"emotions" and “sensations.” while
the freshman—alas. poor infants, they
have been roughly awakened from
their dream that all tracks this side
of the regents’ one were thornless,
and are flocking ensemble to the
library.

But some of the feelings of the
students were general when it was so
forcibly brought to their attention
that the second semester is more
than half over. The usual vain ro-
gi'ets that more had not been accom-
plished, the usual bewilderment that
the time had flown so quickly and
the usual promises of what hard work
the. future will witness. This latter
will probably receive more than the
ordinary amount of attention in the
next two months due to the wonders
that “extra pressure" are said to
acomplish. But whatever the cause
which prcmpts you to work. whether
it be a true student's desire for know-
ledge, or a mere catering to A’s, we
wish you success, and trust you may
deserve it.

young men did not applaud as usual
but hurled the pebbles which they
so carefully gathered.

A last the younger class gave
their play, and this time the young
men of the second class, wishing to
outdo their younger brothers, had

gone up into the mountains and
gathered huge rocks by which to sig-
nify their applause.

Now, after many days upon earth
the young men of both classes were,
summoned before Zeus on Mount
Olympus. And Zeus remembering
the plays where the young men had
so willingly hurled rocks, decreed
that for several eons the young men
should be allowed to increase their
skill at hurling missiles. But in case
the hurling rocks should become too
dangerous a sport he bade them prac—
tice with the best vegetables from
the king‘s garden. And the scribe
wrote in the Book of Deeds and Men,
“They that hurletb———.”

G. A. A. NOTES

The juniors did not surprise us
when they carried off the basketball
championship last Week. We con~
g‘l‘lltllltltu them upon their brilliant
undefeated season.

Thsir college debut three years
ago. when their first team defeated
the sophomores, an almost unheard
of occnrt-nce at State, promised soon-
kind of dazzling career. Yet youth~
ful prodigies are often looked upon
askancc as being- too good to live.
We find the exception in our unus~
Lial class of juniors whose illustrious
squad is composed of:

Heinemann, r. f., Miller, 1. f., Lin»
bech, c., Balding, r. g., Bach, l. g.

'l‘on'iorrow night is a big night in
athletic circles! The Alumnac's
famous stars of former years will
play the Varsity team. Finish your
dinner early, gather your friends
about you, and bring them over to
the gym. at half past seven. if they
do not care for basketball, whisper
in their car that there will be dancing
aftenvard. They will then not be
concerned over parting with twenty»
five cents, especially if you tell them
it goes toward the erection of our
new residence hall.

Monday evening April 30, Miss
Johnson is planning for an intm'class
athletic meet and exhibition. Sopho.
mores and freshmen will be obliged
to take part in competitive marching,
calisthenies, and dancing. Besides
class work, there will be non-com-
pulsory class competition on the up-
paiatus.

Juniors and seniors, since g'},'mna.~:—
ium work is not compulsory with
them, will not be required to enter
the meet: but interested limmbers of
the two classes are invited and urged
to participate.

An added attraction for spectator-*1
will be general dancing after the
meet.

We are expecting the exhibitions
to attract three classes of people:
those who are interested in athletics,
those who enjoy dancing. and time!-
who are interested in the comine'
dormitory, for the twenty-five cents
admission is for that benefit.
Pardon! There should really be only
two classes! we are all interested in
the dorm.

if you can't attend, buy a ticket
