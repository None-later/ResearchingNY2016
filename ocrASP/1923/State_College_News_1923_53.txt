ally good, for it had been prepared
under Miss Thompson's excellent
direction. The menu consisted of
creamed potatoes, ham, rolls, and ice
cream, with coffee. During the meal
there was music and at the end, after
dinner speeches were given by Miss
Johnston and the captain of the class
teams. Miss Johnston spoke about
sportsmanship, and the prospects aml

the hall. In this way a very pleasing
evening was brought to a close, mark-
