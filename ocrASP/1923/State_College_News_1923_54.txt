IS THIS RIGHT?

It is very evident that certain
members of the student; body forget
that their attendance at assembly on
Friday is required by the college auth
orities. This does not mean merely
attendance until the attendance re-
port has been taken. It means attend
ance thru the whole assembly period.
Yet many persons each Friday walk
boldly out of the auditorium at their
first opportunity.

Even if college rule did not require
that a person remain for the entire
period, courtesy to the people who
contribute to the program demands
it. This most discourteous procedure
occurs when an outside speaker is on
the'program as well as when local
talent feature in the entertainment.
It does not give strangers in good
opinion of the student body individ-
ually or collectively. A little that
for the feelings of others would soon
remedy this condition.

STUDENT COlvllllliNTlj

JOBS v- TEACHING

The poignant question in every
Senior's heart is ——- hen?
Where? How much? Some. have
picked out the section of the map in
which they will comle'scend to admit
their presence. Others consider the
question of place with a nonchulunce
that is disarming if not convincing,
and. treat: their more specific bre-
thren whose mothers still have a cer-
tain amount of string tied to them,
with a cold and bored disdain.

Others have picked out the salary
they have judged themselves worthy
of and are patiently awaiting the
principal offering said amount to
appear with the cont'act.

It seems so funny how, outwardly
at least, these people, trained to be
teachers, consider the character of
the service they are to give in their
choice of a job. it isn’t, “Will I be
able to take my place in the com-
munity? Will there be a work for me
there?” Or, “Will I be the type of
teacher for the community?” But
it’s, “Will you pay me a curtain
salary, which I want? How many
classes will I have to teach?"

course we don’t think these
teachers should go out as martyrs to
the cause of their profession or any
such thing. But if the job is one
which is going to give you experience
which is going to help you become
the better kind of tone] 1', Why think
about the salary or location? What
do they matter in the long run of
things when students look up to you
and you reach out to help them find
the truth of things?
REPLY TO COLLEGE SPIRIT vs

BARBARISM

As we read the articles under Stu-
dent Comment in the News issue of
April 20th, we wonder where the
member or members who produced
and attempted to put before the stu-
dents of State such a misconstrued
version of what actually happened
in our assembly, really were at the
time.

We readin grant that the Froshdc»
serve much praise and commondatory
encouragement; for their intinl ap-
pearance before the students ofState.
However, we do not believe that. such
appearance or such success excuses
them. in the slightest degree from
“getting a dose of their own medi-
me.

Someone has mentioned that the
establishment of a precedence is bad
business and we agree to that. Not
one member of the Soph class cntcr~
tained any idea of vegetarian war-
fare until, at the close of our own
stunt some Frosh. who do not know
their places, lowered the dignity of
our chapel period by doing something
unknow to the State College decorum,
namely hurling vegetables. If you
think that did no harm, you might
inquire and find out how long the
smell of onions pervaded the rooms
adjoining the Auditorium and what
a nuisance is was to those who are
really doing something for us. i

If there was nothing challenging.
or antagonistic in the Fresh stunt‘
why were tomatoes sprinkled hcrcand
there on the rostrum and here and
there a bag of onions concealed near
some sharp shooter of the “baby
class?” 01' course, a few snnashy
oranges didn’t count for much, but
at that I believe they overdid what
one solitary cabbage did which was

ities. Come out on May 5th then and

not hurled but was very gently laid
at the feet of a very fine-looking
Frosh on the front of the rostrmn.i

 

l'l‘hc Sophs can account for a few

grapefruit and one cztbl)ttge,7—tliitt
's all. Even then the grupcl’rult were
not. gotten until it was discovered
that the Fresh had already procured
a supply from the some fruit store.
There is not a Soph man who is not
sorry that he is guilty of such con-
duct, and the class of ‘2.) are on re<
cord to do their share to keep our
chapel period what it has been before
this latest episode.

Someone has said, “Why, the Fresh
wouldn’t get stuff to hurl at their
own stunt, would they?" We don’t
believe they would unless they had a
proscntimcnt that they bud done
something wrong and might get “tit
for tut” so the proper thing to do
would )0 to lay in a good supply in
case anything should happen. Then,
as things didn’t start, the accumu-
lation seemed useless and some. I“I'Osli
man got impatient and hit a Soph
behind the ear with an onion. li‘or-
tunutcly, he picked out a good mark,
for the Soph‘s head was harder than
the onion and no harm was done,
only to start the whole works into
definite action.

Now, We. the group of individuals
in the Soph class who did the hurling,
are perfectly willing to take our
share of the blame but, we do not
feel that it is up to ’24 to explain
matters for us, without, the facts.
Where such an array of concoctions
ever came from we do not cure. to
know for we shall only consider the
source. You didn't get a search war—
rant or town constable to get the evi-
dence did you? We feel that you
must have gone a long way to arrive
at such conclusions. l-lowcver, when
you get back where you came from,
you will do fine at digging up things,
but only by way of suggestion we
might add that to, “Be sure you are
right and then go ahead” is not a
half—bad policy for anyone.

What say?

HOME. ECONOMICS NOTES

The Home Economics class of
Milne High School has just; completed
a most interesting project. A lab-
oratory period was taken for a visit
to the Albany Orphan Home where
the girls in the class chose the seven
little tots for when they would make
dresses. When the dresses were com-
pleted, the class took them to the
children and spent an interesting and
amusing time, telling the children
stories and trying on their dresses.
The girls showed their added interest
in the project by taking up ice cream
and cake for the thirty children in
the cottage.

For the children, there was pleas-
ure of company, outside interest and
new dresses. The value for the High
School girls was the construction of
different garments and the giving of
joy to others.
