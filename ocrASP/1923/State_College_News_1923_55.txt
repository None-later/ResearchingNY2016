WOMEN’S CHORUS ENTERTAINS
STUDENT BODY

In student assembly Friday, April
20, Dr. ’l‘hompson treated the stu-
dents to another "song fest.” This
particular “fest” was Scotch, and so
was appropriately opened by “Annie
Laurie.” ’l‘he girls chorus then sang
a little love song called "I—ligliland
Love.” Maybelle Jochumsen, ’23
charmed the students with "John
Anderson, My Jo” and “Mac Mair,
We’ll Meet Again.” lly way of
litle change the chorus rendered
an English folk song "’l'wenty, Eigh-
teen” about a rich, but unattractive
young inan’s vain attempts to win a
young lady who desired only “a
handsome man." This was followed
by a Scotch wartime song of “’l‘he
Beloved Prince Charles" arranng by
Mr. Candlyn. and sung then for the
first time. ’l'he program closed with
noble attempts on the part of the stu-
dent body to master even a few of
the Scottish words of “Auld Lang
Syne."

eligible for Myskania. This list will

6. IMPORTANCE OF CAREFUL
REGISTRATION:

Each student should bear in
mind that lie is registering for
the work he is actually to pur-
sue during the year law-1924.
Changes in schedule will be per-
mitted only in cases affecting
the welfare of the student and
each case will be carefully scru-
tinized by the Dean. Each stu-
dent is therefore urged to regis—
ter carefully, considering his
own comfort as far as possible.

For example:
a) A commuter should inform
himself about train accom-

odations and take care not
to register for Work at hours
when he will be unable to
be at the college.

b) A student who plans to en—
gage in outside work should
consider the hours that will
be needed for such employ—
ment and should not register
for college work at those
hours.

7. Read these directions carefully,
observo the procedure outlined
and thus help to reduce confu-
sion and tiresome waiting in line
to a minimum.

8. SUMMER SESSION. Students
who expect to attend the Suin-
mer Session will be required to
file registration blanks with the

can when they present their
trial sheets for approval. Blanks
for this purpose may be secured
