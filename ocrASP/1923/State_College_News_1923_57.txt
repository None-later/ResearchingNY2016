SORORITY GIRLS DANCE AT
TEN EYCK

Friday evening, April 2'7, the ball-
room of the Ten Eyck Hotel wit-
nessed a brilliant social function in
the guise of Intersorority Ball. The
seven sororities of State College coin-
bined in their efforts to have a jolly
time and they certainly succeeded.
As is customary at all affairs of such
nature, the dress parade was in—
tensely interesting and colorful. The
orchestra, deviating from the modern
jazz, emphasized the real melody and
harmony of the more classical music.
Gray’s orchestra of Schenectady
played from 9 to 2.

A big- feature of the Ball was the
favors. For the men there were very
novel, collegiate pipes on which was
carved the sorority seal. There was
a wild scurry among the male attend-
ants for the necessary materials with
which to enjoy a good old smoke—-
even cigs. were despoiled of their
contents to furnish the much needed
requisite. The women’s favors were
grey leather card cases with the gold
sorority Signet.

The chaperones for the Ball were:
Dean Pierce, Miss Perine, Miss Row-
ley, Professor and Mrs. Rislcy, Dr.
and Mrs. Hastings, Professor and
Mrs. York, Professor and Mrs.
Walker, Dr. and Mrs. Thompson, Mr.
land Mrs. Candlyn, and Mr. and Mrs.
eyo.
