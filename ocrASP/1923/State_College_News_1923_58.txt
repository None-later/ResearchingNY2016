A NEW FORCE

At the present time the tendency
of all people thruout. the world is
toward the glorification of self. As
the people incline, so the nations
assume an attitude of satisfactor
complacency in their own strength
and heed not the plight of other less
fortunate states. The haughty aloof-
ncss that was characteristic of the
pro-war period has again asserted
itself. What is going to be the out-
come'.'

The world war brought attention
to the fact that world affairs, not
national affairs, must be made para-
mount issues. Civilization has pro-
gressed as far as possible along nar-
row restrieted lines. If there is to
be further advance, it must be along
broader, more universal lines. Man
has spent ages helping himself, now

he must help his less fortunate
brother.
Yet in the face of this evident

trend of affairs, men whose minds
still hold jealously to every vestige
of power, refuse to go out of their
own ways to take part in broader,
bigger, more worthwhile projects.
They represent the conservatism that
met its downfall in August 1914.

The big force that impels men to
service now is that of coo eration,
of concerted effort. Class Jealousy,
national distrust, and personal hatred
must be wiped out in order that the
new force can work unhampered.
The optimist predicts its complete

 

STATE COLLEGE NEWS. MAY 4. I923

REVIEW OF THE APRIL
- QUARTERLY
The spring issue of the College
Quarterly is very well assembled. It
contains a good representation of the
four years but a variety of names

from each class would be proof of ’

still greater general intciest. The
contributions have the buoyancy and
hope of this season.

The poetry is particularly good.
The lines of Dr. Richardson are ap-
preciated. ’I‘he lilt of If holds more
sincerity than Before Darkness,
which is in part forced. Commuting
is deserving of especial mention,
which it will have from the numerous
devotees of that art. Sonnet is not
always clear in that as the idea too
frequently carries over to the follow-
ing line. Violin shows great depth
of feeling.

0f the prose The Wasted Life and
Three Women stand out prominently,
the first for its subtle, underlying
thread of personal contact; the
second for its swing from mid—Vic
torian duty to the modern complex.
Opera Classes in too obvious, a theme
of “Back Home" long drawn out.
For a story to “Make the Whole
World a-kin", doubtless The Freak of
Anatomy finds a responsive group of
readers. “A lion among ladies” gives
My Hour of Glory his masculine
touch. Whether an author can bi.-
partial to one character and cynical
of the other, is a question of “The
lady or the Tiger". At any rate,
the contrasting note is interesting.

Humor should surely not. lie so
scarce. Wild Anecdotes is Well told,
llnll The Goslipmongers
sense of rumor and sense of humor in

combination. The parody on The
Psalm of Life is quite amusing. The
Merry Razz has its joke, slightly

tinged with sarcasm, or appeals to a
small local group. Perhaps the name
misleads and the department is not
intended to be purely humorous.

At a chair factory in a North Caro-

loading chairs all day on a large
truck to be taken to the depot for
shipment. The shades of night were
falling and the old man was very
tired. He thought his day’s work was
over when the truck backed up to be
loaded once more, whereupon the old
man exclaimed: “Ah hopes dis hero
