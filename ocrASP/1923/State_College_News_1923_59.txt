meet was held in the college gym.
Monday evening, April 30. About
eight o’clock the two classes assei‘n‘
bled in the hall and in single file
marched into the gym. and lined up
on two sides of the room. When the
sounds of “marking time" had died
away, and the students were seated
on the floor, a picked group oi‘ li’resh-
men was called out, and in a second’s
time after the command had been
given, formed the letters, i. A. \.
’l’hc 2:06 section of Sophomores then
exhibited their skill in "right forward
fours right", evading and all kinds of
marching. Each section then, alter-
nating r‘reshmen‘ and .‘imiheniores,
gave exhibitions of marching, each
section doing better than the preceit
ing one, until the 0:00 I"i'(:Hll|‘.l}ln
Class, and the 3: f: Sophomore
Class surpassed them all. 'i‘iie whole
Freshman Class was next called to
order, and, tho it seemed impossible,
they were lined up in rows of twelve
across the whole gym. floor. The
audience then was privileged to see

tired l'roin the floor, the i-iophemni .4,
;in rows of ten, attempted to surpass
ltlieir rivals in a more eonipli'ate'l

After "setting up” the audience just

then they literally “howled” \vheii
the dance was brought to a grand

men were soon marshalled on the

During the evening four people had
been conspicuous by their beautiful
bouquets of sweet peas and also by
little notebooks and pencils, unich
they made use of from time to time.
At the end of the dancing these four
handed in their little slips of paper.
While these were being examined a
group of Freshman and Sophomo is

Wallace ﬁnally put an end to sus-

the contests, the Freshmen winning
a very few points, having especi—

dancing.

The audience, which had packed
the gallery, and had paid its twenty—
ﬁve cents each to the Dormitory
Fund, was then given an epl‘iortunlty
to dance.
