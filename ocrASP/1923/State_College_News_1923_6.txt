Letz Quartete Gives Pleas-
ing Concert

KREISLER QUARTET PRESENTED
FOR FIRST TIME IN ALBANY

 

 

A week of notable musical attrac-
tions in Albany was closed Saturday
evening, January it}, when the Music
Association presented the |,etz Quar—
tet in a recital at Chancellors Hall.
The lietz Quartet substituted for the
originally engaged London String
Quartet. No one who heard these
musicians could have felt that there
was any loss in the substitution.
Hans Li'tz, first violin; Edwin llacli-
mann, second violin; Edward l\remer,
viola; and Horace Britt, cellist; are
artists of the first rank In concert
playii  Sitting through their recital
Saturday night gave one reluctance
to weigh it on the scales employed by
the critic, but to record it merely as
a gracious, refreshing. and lovely ex~
perience. String quartets are apt to
adhere so closoly to higher classmle
formulas that they seldom humanize
music, but the Letz four an leave
the stately dignity of Mozarts iiuar-
tet in C major and kindle the warmth
of meloin as realized by other coin—
l’aying all respect to the
" eism of Mozart they yet reach a
wider audience with a Schubert quar—

 

  

-tet in I) minor, and then intrigue it

with a marvelous rendition of De-

bussy's quartet in G minor. .This
was a veritable carvnial of. the
strangely beautiful phrases of the

modern frenchman.

'l‘hey followed it with a Debussy
encore, “The Girl with the Flaxen
Hair," who, if Debussy correctly
translates her in terms of music, must
have hail something of all the beauties
of the world.

Ki'eisl ' as a composer for string
quartets is new to Albany. His A
minor quartet strikes the lay car as
imbued with the beautiful tones anu
phrases that the master brings from
his violin in his arrangements. it is
frankly sentimetal in manner, snright—
ly at times and umlerstandable by
an elemental musical intelligence.

There were lobby whisperith
after the concert that it lacked this
anil that. it surely ilid not lack charm.
The ’l‘schakowski Andante Cantable
was the last encore, a parting memory
of a rare musical evening. Dr. Harold
W. Thompson who brought the con-
cert did a fine thing for musical
Albany.

Last year was the first time that
chamber music was introduced into
the program of college events. Judg-
ing from the number of students in
attendance and from the discussions
and favorable criticisms, the students
are in favor of mo"e such concerts.

The success of the concert is due
. ’l‘hoinnson, who directed the

Ictets and also attended
to all advertising matters.
