An Emporia school nurse was tell-
ing a health story to a first-grade
class. “Now what," she asked in
review of the story, “was the name
of the good fairy that was dressed
all in white?” For a moment the
class was silent, then a. little colored
boy answered hopefully, “Ku Klux?"

Inlemparnnce

The woman was undeniably stout
and she bulged out over her tight
dress wherever such bulging was

osible.

"Look at that woman,” said a slim
young thing. “She looks as if she'd
been poured into her clothes.”

“Yes,” returned her escort, “and
l'org'ot to ‘say when.’ "—Boston Trun-
script.
