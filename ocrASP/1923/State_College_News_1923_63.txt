MOVING UP DAY PREMONITIONS

Student assembly last Friday, with
its election of Myskania members and
its song practice for Moving-Up-Day,
especially the last verse of "Where,
Oh, Where", has given us a premoni-
tion that we shall need an extra num-
ber of pocket handkerchicfs when
that decisive day arrives.

Among other reasons for which we
shall probably require this "“'
supply of linen will be penitence for
past lack of appreciation for college.
Somehow we feel that the events of
Moving-Up-Day will make us ashamed
of certain fleeting moods of discon-
tent, called forth by someone's
dissatisfied remarks.

c shall call ourselves to account,
0 on our eyes to the advantages
paced unconditionally before us,and
thank God that we were born in an
age when the privilege of education
requires not base gold but earnest
0 fort.

We wonder what feeling the
seniors will experience as the Junior
Class moves into the seats of honor
they occupied the last of their four
years spentvhere; some, the more
noble, Will deeply acknowledge their
love for “State”; some will apprec-
iate their indebtedness; others, no
matter what has been their attitude
here-to-for, must, on this day at least,
feel some pleasurable relationship to
their Alma Mater .

The opportunities of the seniors,
however. are passing on to us who
remain here. May we be worthy
of our heritage.

STATE'S IDOL

Judging from observation, because
thus far that is the only criterion
to be noted, the Intercluss Committee
on Rules was most wise and colleg-
iater provident in instituting a good,
wholesome outlet for the healthy
spirit of rivalry which is inevitable
between frosh and sophs anywhere.
A big portion of such spirit is one
of the greatest possessions a college
could desire for it is this rivalry that
keeps thing lively, that makes college
life so different and therefore so
intensely interesting. It gives the
community which possessos it a zest
and enthusiasm that is absolutely
irresistible—it penetrates and reacts
upon the members of the community.
In fact nothing could be a better
stimulant. for us, especially during
these times of semi-quiescence in
mentality and physique. Some of us
may dub this passive malady “spring
fever”_ others "nervous reaction ’ but
whatever it is, we’ve got it and a
remedy is much needed either to kill
or cure. Now in all normal mortals,
and we give ourselves credit for
being normal, there lies a spark of
that famous instinct called rivalry
and altho it may be dormant, yet
under proper conditions it can be
brought to life and burn most
brilliantly.

According to the dictates of nature
frosh and sophs all over the war
are endowed with an ultra-su or
amount of this instinct and the ig
roblem is to provide a medium for
its expression. And so it was that
Myskania, realizing the innate char-
acteristics of the o underclasses
and appreciating the fact that this

should talk to some of the girls who

FACULTY NOTES

Miss Perine attended the four-
teenth convention of the Eastern
Arts Association that was held at
Providence, It. 1., May 3-4-5. Over
nine hundred teachers from normal
schools, colleges, and high schools,
all specialists in art, were present.
There were exhibits from all Eastern
United States, as far west as Cleve-
land. Many visits were made to
colonial houses and to the various
libraries including the John Carter
Brown Library, the Library of
Brown University, and the Ann Mary
Library where the Hawkins collection
is kept.

At the general session on Friday,
Walter Sargent, Prof. of Art Edu-
cation at the University of Chicago.
gave an address on “A Modern Pro-
gram in Art Education.” Another no-
table address was given by Harriet
E. Ainsworth on “The Art of
Dressing". Miss Ainsworth is
director of Filine’s Clothing Informa-
tion Bureau that is connected with
Filine’s department store in Boston.
It was a very instructive and inter-
esting address .showine; the essentials
of art education to the commercial
enterprises.

Miss Perine believes that the inspi-
ration of such meeting to art teachers
is valueless.

The next meeting of the Associa-
tion will be held at Atlantic City next
year.

Professor Risley addressed the
United Spanish War Veterans on
their 25th Anniversary of the Spanish
War on April 21, at Chaneellors’
