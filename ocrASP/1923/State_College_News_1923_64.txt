How Electrical
Engineering began

5-; T IS not enough to ex-
periment and to observe
In scientiﬁc research.
’ There must also be in-
terpretation. Take the cases of
Golvani and Volta.

One dayin r786 Galvani touched
with his metal instruments the
nerves of a frog’s amputated hind
legs. The legs twitchcd in a
very life-like way. Even when the
frog's legs were hung from an iron
railing by copper hooks, the phe-
nomenon persisted. Galvani
knew that he was dealing with
electricity but concluded that the
frog's 1ch had in some way gen-
erated the current.

Then came Volta, a contempo-
rary, who said in eﬁcct:“ Your in-
terpretation is wrong. Two diﬁ'er.
cnt metals in contact with a moist
nerve set up currents ofelcctricity.
I will rovc it without the aid of
frog’s ego.”

Volta piled disks of different
metals one. on top of another and

 
 

General

separated the disks with moist
pieces of cloth. Thus he geno-
rated a. steady current. This was
the " Voltaic pile”—-the ﬁrst bat-
tery, their" generator of
electricity.

Both Galvani and Volta were
careful experimenters, but Volta’s
correct interpretation of cﬂ'ecu
gave us electrical engineering.

Napoleon was the outstanding
ﬁgure in the days of Galvani and
Volta. He too possessed an active
interest in science but only as an
aid to NapoleonJ-Ie little imagined
on cxaminingVolta’s crude battery
that its eﬁ'ect on later civilization
would be fully as profound as that
of his own dynamic personality.

The cﬁ'ccts of the work of Gal.
vani and Volta may be traced
through a hundred years of elec-
trical development even to the
latest discoveries made in the Re-
search Laboratories of ther
oral Electric Company.
