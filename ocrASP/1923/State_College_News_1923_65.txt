SPANISH CARNIVAL A SUCCESS
(Continued from page 1)

the part of a fyoung lover and Miss

Holmes that 0 his sweetheart. The

dance depicted a love scene.

The final, most unique number on
the program was a scene in a Spanish
cabaret where both Spaniards and
Americans mingled. Special features
of the cabaret were solos by Rose
Bulgarian, ’24 and Marjorie Blythe,
’23, a solo dance by Mary Flanigan,
’26 and a male quartet consisting of
Charles Reilley, ’23, John Hayes, ’24,
John Cassavant, ’24, and John Cas-
arette, ’23.

While the audience waited breath-
lessly in the auditorium for the
announcement that the arrangements
for the bull fight in the gymnasium
had been com leted, representatives
of the Spanis -American paper of
New York took flashes of the group.

Festivities in the ymnasium
opened by the entrance 0 the queen
o the carnival, Glennon Easman, ’23
who took her place on the balcony.
Then entered the fighters, Professors
York, Hastings and Kennedy, mount-

on fiery chargers. Professor
Decker, the hero of the hour, received
the favor from the queen and the hull
was let loose. The mounted men
antagonized him until his rage was
at its height. Then Professor Decker,
alone and unmounted, stepped into
the ring. Alone he fought the bloody
contest to the end. Victor, he
received the queen’s reward.

When the bull fight was over
Professor Stinard was called to the
balcony by the queen and presented
with a gift of a old pencil in recog-
nition of his tire ess efforts to make
the carnival a success.

Dancing amid showers of confetti
and colored streamers followed.

Among those who were prominent
in helping to make the carnival what
it was are: Laura Ebell, ’23, who as
president of the Spanish Club was
supervisor of all committees; Gladys

 

Van Vranken, ’24, chairman of the
refreshment committeo;_ Glennon
Easman, '23, in charge of cotumes;
Grace Aronowitz, ’23 chairman of
music committee; Elizabeth Nag-1e,
‘24, stage manager; Susan Collier,
‘23, in charge of,the sale of tickets.
