S. C. T. Moves Up

Freshmen are already hegiuning to
anticipate their glories as Sophomores
while the Seniors are. beginning to
Feel the sadness of their approaching
farewell to Alma Mater. Movng Up
Day, the day ol‘ days in State College
year is at hand.

As an institution Moving Up Day
is common to a great many colleges.
in State College, which itself is not
i very old, Moving Up Day is compara—
tively new. it was founded in HM
by the Senior Class. Jennie Davis,
now Mrs. WIIIi‘am Kennedy, of that
class was prominent in the organiza-
tion of the plans for the day.

’l‘he program for tht first Moving
Up Day was practically the same as
it is today. The planting ot' the ivy
and the presentation at the senior
;gilt are. among the tow additions to
i the original program.

' On the first Moving Up Day the
classes ‘llltlt early and marched to the
auditorium where they wcreaddressea
by Dr. lrulmcher and hy class speak-
ers. ’l‘Iranvalk to ltidgel‘ield I’ark
l_or athletlc events and the college
smg on the in the evening were
Features oi the, day.

()l‘ course, the appointment of
:Myskanla. which itself was not
‘ lounded until 18))? and the distribu-
‘thll ot‘ pins to the News‘ Editors
[which today, are part of the program
,have lll,‘(‘ll added to the list of the
levents ol‘ the first Moving Up Day.
\ 'l‘he.spirit of Moving Up Day is
the spirit of progress. Students are
rewarded liar the long hours of study
by a step torward nearer the goal of
their anihitions.

:Kenneth MacGowan Lectures
on Phases of Stage Progress

"i shall prolmhly tell you a great
many things that seem absolutely
ahsurd or silly yet which we not he—
yond the limit of possibility in the
theatre ol' tomorrow,” was the as—
tounding statement at Mr. Kenneth
Mat-.(iowan in his lecture Friday night

May I l, on the “'l‘heatre 01' ’l‘o-
niorrow." Mr. MacGowan is the
dramatic edltor ol' the New York

Gluln‘.

i The lecture lu gun with a review at
lthe theatre of the past. Mr. Mac
. (Iowan showed pictures and spoke oi
the old Greek and lioman theatres,
gradually merging tln'u the story of
the Mcdiaeval and Elizabethan
theatre to that ol.’ the present day
theatre.

ln spe‘iking of modern setting he
said that most modern makers of set-
tings were merely reformer They
are seeking to make over the old by
elimination of details and by empha—
sis on absolute simplicity.

The discussion 01' cxpressimmlistic
art in stage setting was one of the
features of the lecture. interesting
pictures of expressiomdistic attempts
in the production of scenery both
American and foreign made the story
01' this art more vivid. According
to Mr. MacGowan the new aim is to
bring out the emotion of the scene
rather than to attepmt any realistic
reproduction at it.

Mr. MacGowan also discussed the
modern tendency toward permanent
stage sets. I'le lu-iel'ly showed that
