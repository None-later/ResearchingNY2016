BEG PARDON
The News wishes to correct a mis-
take occuring in the Faculty Notes
of the last issue. Miss Perine was
reported as saying that the inspira-

tion ot.‘ convention meetings was
vaiueless. What Miss Perinc said

was that; “the inspiration or these
meetings was invaluable.”

CONGRATULATIONS

if this issue of the “News” appears-
different from its predecessors, it is
because the new board is making its
initial attempt at editing the paper.
After four years of hard work and
little credit they have arrived. ’l‘his
is their first opportunity to put in
new ideas and improve the makeup
of the paper.

If they do this successfully, they
will continue the upward trend of
the “News” thru the few years of
its existence. As the time goes on
the paper should come nearer to that
ideal which is without fault and
pleases everybody.

It; is our privilege and pleasure as
senior editors to take this opportun-
ity to congratulate the juniors who
have been designated as senior mem-
bers of the board and wish them
success.

BIOLOGY FIELD TRIP
The Biology field trip this week
Saturday, May 1.0, will take place at
Mill Creek Gorge, Hamiltons. The
car leaves the Albany Southern

Station at 2:00 P. M. and returns at b

5:30 P. M. The cost of the trip will

be 28 cents.

 

THE NEW LEAF

Attention all freshmen! ’i‘o-day
May 18 is Moving Up Day, and otir
class is now the sophomore class 01‘
S .C. ’l‘. Let’s profit by our exper-
iencc this past year and start out the
sophomore class with lots oi? pop and
spirit.

Get out your “trash” handbooks
and read. It says, “Pay your class
dues and attend class meetings.”
Remember that next year, when you
come back as a sophomore, pay your
class dues as soon as the collection
01' them starts. ’l.‘hen attean the
meetings. It’s your privilege it’ you
have paid your dues, but more than
that it’s your duty. No class can
be at its best it half its members
take no interest in what it is doing.
When it comes time to vote on any
question which may come tip, attend
the meeting and vote. Don’t stay
away; and when elections are over
come around .i‘i'iding [unit because
they didn’t come out as you thought
they should. Work for your class,
put all your “pep” and “spirit” into
it and watch things “come your way.”

e have had a year to see the
results of not attending class meetv
lugs and ol' iint paying dues; we know
how many ol' otir members couldn’t
vote in claSs elections. We don
want the same things to happen next
year. Let’s make a resolution that
it won’t. Why not have our class
the banner class ol' next year. We
have the members and the experience.
Now it’s up to us to show S. C. ’I‘
that we have a little push.

We may say that we didn’t know
’ ‘ were going this year, but
we can’t give that excuse next war.
Why should we have to? Let’s run
the class so that excuses won’t be
necessary .

OF COURSE YOU'RE GOING

Is everybody getting ready for the
Silver Bay Conference? You know
the time is fast approaching——why
just imagine, it isn’t more than
month away and consider how hor-
'bly busy you will be in that
interval! Therefore isn’t it time
that we at least began to think about
the glorious wonders ol‘ the place;
its exquisite scenery, its jolly fun, its
spirit of goodfcllowship and camara-
derie, and its salubrious stimulation
of our mental and moral beings?
Surely not one of us can afford to
miss any one of these benefits
because they are the very elements
which make our experience rich and
our life worth the living. It is this
apreciation of nature combined with
the companionship of pals that
cements our character and makes it
approved of God and man.

So now that We have thought it all
over, let’s sign up on the bulletin
board and then talk with one ol‘ the
girls that has really been there and
can give us first-hand information.
After her painting of the picture we
simply won’t be able to resist the
lure of the place. Immediately we’ll
egin to pack up that “old kit bag"
and then we’ll be the happiest
mortals on earth!

STUDENT COMMENT”-

 

CABINET HOUSE PARTY

Bright sunlight on blue water, the
splash of ours as the uneven shore
line receds—we are off on Kinder-
hook Lake, bound for the haunt of
the W. Cabinet as they left it last
Sunday afternoon.

It was quite different when they
arrived there however; the sunshine
was lacking and those who moored
their bark'bcforc the little cottage
Saturday morning found themselves
not altogether dry. After making a
fire to dry their damp apparel and
stimulate their boisterous spirits,
they began the never ending process
ol' eating while they investigated
their new abode. some out of curio-
sity, others with evil intentioned plans
for night raids, such as sprinkling
cold spring water on the reclining
ones throuin a hole in the ceiling
overhead.

A “not so had” piano was discov-
ered in the front roonr and train that
time t'orth was not allowed to hold
its peace.

Toward afternoon, when the
weather somewhat relented, the two
rowboats pushed off from shore, and
the “Y” cabinet members began a
rigid training ol? the biceps, which
ended only when the last boat load
had been landed at the pier Sunday
Iiigltt.

Saturday evening, spent neces-
sarily indoors, was made jolly with
songs and games. “Up Jenkins” re—
sulted in high hilarity. Al'ter devo-
tions there crept into bed 't'it'teen
weary mortals, seven ol’ whom
attempted sleep while the other eight
in loud voices discussed problems ol‘
universal inte' as whether or not
the lamp downstairs should be kept
burning all night. The actual retir—
ing hour and the time of rising are
state secrets.

What a glorious place it was on

,_.

 

Sunday with dancing, sparkling
waves below and slowly changing

cloud pictures overhead. it was truly
a temptation to neglect all responsi-
bility and stay there endlessly, lulled
by the rise and fall of the waves.
By the time the little group had to
say good bye they had become quite
attached to the little cottage, to each
other, and to Miss Scotland whom
they voted an ideal chaperon.

STUDENT ASSEMBLY

Student Assembly was opened as
usual on Friday, May 11, by singing
the Alert Mater.

Dr. Thompson made some announ-
cements coucerning the concert
scheduled for that evening. Then
Mr. Candlyn spoke of the new song
book. it is a collection taken from
other college song books, from the
old song book and some new songs.
For about ten ol' the songs the coni-
mittee is indebted to the Eta Phi
Sorority. Miss Ethel Cummings, ’23
designed the cover for the new song

Miss Perine talked for a few min-
utes on the art exhibition. She
showed some pictures which anyone
would appreciate amt others which
would require more knowledge of
modern art to appreciate. One .of
the pictures had been criticized quite
severely by the students. Miss Per-
ine claims that the criticism is too
narrow for although one might not
want it in her own home, neverthe-
less it may be art.

The period ended by practicing for
Moving Up Day.

 

TENNIS TOURNAMENT
The Tennis Tournaments have
been delayed this season due to the
fact that the courts in the park have
