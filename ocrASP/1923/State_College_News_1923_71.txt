The History of State? College

Leads in Profeuional Education During 78 Year: of Service

State College was the third teacher"
training: institution to be founded in
the United States, and the first to
be established in New York State.

United States was founded at Lexing-

time. The founding of a. normal
school had been advocated by state

This bill was successfully carried

Alonzo Potter, Hon. Gideon Hawley,
