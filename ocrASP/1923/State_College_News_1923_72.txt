DEAN HORNER

With the announcement that Dean
Homer is to leave State College
comes a sense of impending loss.
During the six years that he has been
here he has grown to be a part, a
very necessary part, of the college
in the minds of students and the pub-
to.

There is no student in college at

present or in the five preceding
classes who has not been able to get
a clearer view of the future oppor-
tunities and a firmer grip on his own
capacities because of the sterling ad-
vice of Dean Homer. There were
many scholastic tangles that became
less intricate because of his helpful
service. Some of us may remember
that important matters other than
scholastic ones were straightened out
in time to avoid serious consequences
because of his sympathetic under-
standing. ‘
' The fine ideals of service that
characterize his college work he has
carried out into the numerous other
fields in which he works. In civic
progress he has become one of the
foremost figures. His work durin
war time can never be forgotten. He
has risen to prominence among his
‘ fellows as a preacher of the Rotary
ideal. His position as Governor of
the Metropolitan District of Rotary
International has made him a nation—
al figure. His fine work as business
man, school man. and church man has
done a great deal to make Albany a
better and higher type of city.

In his taking up his new work as
Field Secretary of the State Teachers
Association we feel that he is going
into a new field with an enlarged
opportunity for service. While State

College cannot help but regret to see
him leave there is some consolation
in the fact that his untiring service
will do, a great deal to unite the
teaching profession of which we hope
to be a part.

 

 

STATE COLLEGE NEWS,

'25 T0 '23 AND ’21

Once upon a time there lived in a
big nest under the care of their lov-
ing mother, four birdlets. Now, as
it happened, there still remained a
little green egg in this nest which
would soon hatch out the future
baby of the bird family, and this
thonghtful little mother realized her
home was only large enough to hold
four, so one of her family must
leave. She hated to part with any of
her children. but there was one, her
eldest, who was stronger and larger
than the rest, for her eldest had
broken through its shell a day in ad-
vance of the others, and was now
anxious to try its own strength. As
we have said 'beforo, this little
mother was loving a little mother, so
she did not push her oldest out of the
neat, but chirped gentle words of ad-
vice to it while she talked of its (le—
parture.

And when the day of the farewell
came there was great grieving. The
bird sister next in years mingled
tears of self-pity with tears for the
departing, for to-morrow she, too,
must leave. But,“ to tell the truth,
she was too busy planning her to‘
morrow to (really) be broken
hearted. The mother too grieved,
but she was too practical to weep
longs—besides, shortly, another bird-
Iet would take this one's place. Aml
the baby too grieved, but she wept
only because the rest of the family
were sad ———and she was young and
foolish and gay and hated sadness.
But there was one member of the
l'amily who grieved most of all over
the departing one and that was the
one next to the baby. You see, she
remember away back in the begin-
nings of her life, how this big sister
had hovered over her with protecting
wing when it was cold and stormy
and mother was away. She remem-
bered also how she had defended her
from the other birds of the nest—
for those other birds and one in
particular were quarrel-some, and
then, when this little bird was pushed
out of its place by a new baby she
remembered that bi -' sister had not
deserted her, but sti stood by to see
that she had plenty of food to eat,
and a nice warm wing to sleep under.
And so she grieved and grieved anti
grieved.

But this bird was a wise little bird
and was just beginning to think for
herself—so she started thinking.
She had noticed when peeping from
here nest from time to time, that the
buds of the tree in which she dwelt
had given place to open lIOWers; then
the petals of the ﬂowers had dropped
and given place to young fruit. She
had noticed that the bug family next
door had all grown up and gone, and
a new family was now living in the
crevice in the bark. And so, after
deep and ponderous thought, this
little bird decided that the world was
a world of growth, of changes, of

g progress—and that her home, in-

stead of being stagnant, must move
with the rest. She felt pride. too,
deep in her heart because she had a
big and good and loving sister to
send out into the world. She knew,
for she had lived with this sister, Just
how big and good and loving she
was, she had faith that she would be
just as kind and helpful outside as
she had been in the home nest. And
so this little bird, when the day of
departure came, lifted her head
proudly and chirped checrily to her
beloved sister:—
“Now that you are leaving
New paths of life to try
Instead of useless grieving
Here’s luck for byc-and-bye.”
And as this little bird sang she

deep in the bottom of the nest and
soon to hatch forth, and she pledged
hereslf right then and there to be as
much of a big sister to her little-
slster-to-be as her big sister had been
to her when she was only a week
little birdlet.

THE TRY-OUT SPIRIT

“What to do when I come to Col-
lege? How to do it?” These are
the two big questions every member
of 1927 is going to ask himself when
he comes for the first time and is
plunged, whether or no, into the big
industry of college life. And “How
to guide him'!”, that is the great
question for us to ponder on.

We have had experience. We have
asked the very questions many times
and sometimes they have been ans-
wered, sometimes not. Experience
has taught us that questions like that
have many answers, some apparently
satisfactory, but only one true one.
Dare we tell you? Dare we hope
that what we have found out may
help you? We do hope that it may
and so We tell you of the ’l‘ry-Out
Spirit.

’l‘herc is more to college than the
classes you attend and the marks you
get. There is a hip; thing called Col-
lege Life which is a spirit fostered by
those extra—curriculum activities for
expression, which State has in such
wise abundance. There are commit-
tees for almost every type of organ—
ization; there are the organizations,
the clubs, the publications, the honors
which_are the ultimate ends of these
committees. Every line of human
expression :5 represented in some way
at State. It remains for the fresh~
man to discover for himself that line
of expression for which he is best
fitted, to which he can give his best
work.

.Unlcss he is by desire or talent
fitted for one or two fields of organ-
ization he IS apt to rest doubtful and
inactive, to try one thing, and fail-
ing, abandon it and all others, until
ll. is too late to correct his mistep.

Now the Try—Out Spirit,—~the
spirit of “try everything ‘till you
find what you can do best and enjoy
most, then go at it hard and stick for
c pure love of the thing itself!"
That’s the spirit that develops leaders
capable workers, satisfied “folks”.

1927 be willing to do whatever
task comes your way. Don‘t hide
your talents! Don’t be afraid to try!

sk to help, everyone needs it.

Whether it be chasing “ads” for the
News or Quarterly; helping decorate
the “Gym” for a party; being in a
stunt, or going faithfully to club
meetings, do it HARD! When you
have found what you can do best
keep at it!

Keep at it 1927 and come out on
op.

The Freshman Class of ’26, about

her heartiest wishes for a year as full
of good fellowship, and earnest ac—

thought of the green egg nestlcdtcomplishment as has been her own,

reminding them that in college as
elsewhere “life is what you make it",
assuring; them that State offers to
them the opportunity for expressing
the best they possess, counselling
them to adopt a broad minded view
of life: hesitance in criticizing with-
out full and sound information, ap-
preciation of the merits and high
motives of others, zeal in attaining
a noble goal beyond the toilsomeness
of daily study. As their dcstincd
rivals the members of ’26 promise
the entering freshmen the same
wholesome good sportsmanship the
sophomores manifested toward them
during the past year.
Class of ’27, greetings!
