DRIVE FOR DORMITORY AT
STATE ‘

'I‘hat a dormitory, providinr the'
nearest appropriation to ideal iving
conditions and insuring to parents
the siif( v and welfare of their
daughters was imperative to the suc-
cesst'ul rounding out of the service
iiml eilicieney of State college, has
long been conceded by those on the
ground. ’l'wo pioneer alumnae have
been most concerned in bringing this
home to alumni not there to see for
themselves. Dean Pierce, who first,
last, and always talked Dormitory to
the active alumni, and Mrs. lillia
Sloan Cameron, ’90, who through the
organization of the Graduate Council
and of the Alumni Quarterly pro-
\‘idcd the means of spreading infor-
mation and uuadrupllng the active
membership.

The campaiin was started Novem-
ber h, 1021 when the Eastern Branch
of the New York Alumni Association.
with the approval of the trustees of
the College and the I'lxecutive Com—
mittee of the General Association,
resolved that a committt ' lire be
appointed by the
should discover availab property in
Albany, organize the drive, and pre-i
sent plans by which the l'laste' ‘
B 'anch should pay the iiiital co. s of
publicity. Resides this committee‘,
there have been appointed chairmen
for every state and county, assisted
by captains. who are each respon-,
sible for a certain number of alumni»
The city of Albany itself is divided
into five sections each presided over
by a lieutenant who has supervision
over eighty alumni. By means of
lettei. aml personal interviews all
State lolleg Alumni have
made acquainted with the project.
and from the response in pledges and
cash contributions the liesiilence
Hall is now an ured fast.

’l‘ie goal set Is three hundred
thousand dollars, which is needed to
build an adequate dormitory for the
growing needs of State College.
This Dormitory would house the
three or four hundred women who
are now living in 1312 private houses,
7 sorority houses, Newman House,
the “Y” House, and Sydduin llall
Already over eighty-eight thousand
dollars has been pledged or contri-
buted. The classes of ’22 and “3:1
have pledged one hundred per cent
strong toward the fund. The faculty
is also hacking the movement almost
unanimously. Pledges have been re-
ceived from Czechoslovakia, Japan,
and india; from Panama and South
America, and from Maine to Cali-
fornia. The Eastern Branch of the
Alumni Association has already rnis~
ed $1,062. by teas, benefit movies,
and public r 'idings given by Miss
Agnes Futterer, instructor of ring—
lish in the college. The f)" 's
class. both last year and this year,
has donated the proceeds of the plays
which it presented. The Music Asset-
iation. the Spanish Club, in fact prac-
tically all the organizations in college
have materially aided the fund. Not
only the alumni, then, but the stu-
de ts of State College have shown
their interest and supported the tag
days, movie shows. entertainments of
all sorts. and have long since become
accustomed to “shelling out" for the
“benefit of the Dormitory Fund", for
they, most of all. feel the needs and
advantages of a Dormitory.

Under the able supervision of the
chairman ,Jolin M. Sayles, ’02. prin-
cipal of the Millie High School. with
the assistance of Mabel ’i‘allmadge,
’1]. Executive Secretary, Clarence
Hidlcy. ’15, Treasurer, and other
splendid officers, it: seems very cer-
tain that by June $100.000 will be
I‘illiscii. and eventually the $300,000
a so.

LI’i‘TLE POSSIBILITY OF PHI
BETA KAPPA HERE

’l‘here has been much comment
concerning the possibility of the
establishment 01:“ a chapter of Phi
Beta Kappa at State. The state-
ment is advanced that We have not
the proper .courses or scholastic
ratinr, or, on the other hand, that
We may have a chapter immediately.
Both opinions are, fallaclous. State
meets the requirement by offering a
course in hihe‘al Arts. However, ac-
cording to a new ruling which
divides the country into five districts,
she must secure the approval of two-
thirds the chapters of her district.
Since our district is composed of
No ,lilngland, New Jersey, New
Yerk, aml Pennsylvania, a pro-
posed chapter at htate would need
the approval of about tlilrty estab-
lished chapters to be recognized. It
is improbable that this will ever
happen as the purpose of the ruling
is to make it diilicult for an Eastern
college to enter the Association. We
are not alone in this position, but
have as associates such institutions
as Mt. l‘iolyoke, St. Stephen’s College,
and I'lllni 'a College for Women .

Utica Branch, which holds its meet-
ing in May, and whose officers are:
president, Mabel Harris, ’07, Utic ,

Nolan Owen, "13, Utica, N. Y.

At the same time was organized
the Fulton County Branch. whose
officers are: president, Elizabeth

Janet Anthony, ’05. Gloversvilie.

he most recent branch is the Hud-
son Valley Branch, organized Novem-
ber 17, 1922 with George Schiavoni,
’20~ Poughkcepsie, as president, and
Hope Fordliam, ’14, Beacon, as sec-
rotary.

To the members of each graduating
class are sent blanks containing num-
erous questions dealing with the col-
lego life and the desire to become a
member of the Association. By re-
turning this blank with two dolhirs,
the alumnus becomes a member of
the General Association for one year,
and is entitled to the Alumni Quar-
terlv. He may then also become
affiliated with any of the local organ-
izations and take part in anv of its
activities, such as dinners, aml iunch~
cons, campaigns or drives.

Besides numerous gifts to the Col-
lege, the biggest thing which these
Alumni Associations has done. is the
launching and splendid carrying on
of the Residence Hall Campaign.
