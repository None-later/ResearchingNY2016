FOOTBALL

With the opening of college last
September came a new football squad
for State. For a number of years
prior to this season there had been
no football team at State. Coach
Siiavely l'elt cenl'ident that N. Y. S.
C. 'l‘. had the men and spirit neces—
sary for a good eleven; and when he
first called the men out for practice,
the way they dug in and went at it
showed that here were the “makings”
of a team that could kick the pig—
skin around in pretty fair shape. A
few practices revealed the fact that
our men could tackle and be tackled
with the best of them.

With but a short time to practice,
State played its first game which,
although not a winning one, showc
the Purple and Gold eleven to be a
hard l'igbting team. The following
games showed that all State needed
to have a winning eleven was time
to practice.

Next year will without a doubt see
State with a fast working team. The
eleven will be made up of nearly the
same men as this season, with the
chances of some good players from
the entering freshmen.

The men out for football this
season were: Beaver, ’24, Smith, ’24,
Catoii, ’24, .luckett, '25, Cristie, ‘Zli,
Sage, ’26, Howe, ’26, Wegiier, '26,
Casserette, ’23, Vines, '24, Crane, '25,
Daley '24, Breslaw, ’25, Howard, ’26.
Cassavant, ’24 and Kershaw, ’2li.

NEW COACH

Coach Snavely has resigned his
position as Coach at State 1 ter hav—
ing held the position of coach and
physical education instructor for
three years. He has accepted a po-
sition as principal in the Spencerport
High School for the coming year.

Mr. Snavely has worked faithfully
toward building up a strong football,
basketball, and baseball team for
State. In September he organized
and coached a. football team for the
Purple and Gold, the first football
team State has had for a number of
years.

While our teams have not been
entirely winning ones, there has been
consistent improvement in their work,

 

 

and they have made State realize that
it has men who can play the game.

r. Snavely’s work here will be
taken up by Coach Wegner who is
a graduate of Cornell University. He
is a three letter man, having won his
letter in football, basketball. iind
track. He also played on the class
teams and was a member of the Car-
nell 'l'rcshman crew.

Coach Wegner visited State and
met all the men interested in athletics
it is evident that he means to do his
utteriiiost to place State on the min
l'o' athletics. Having had experience
on college teams he should be able to
carry out the position of coach in a
very efficient manner.

A large number 01" the men with
whom he will have to work will be
men who have bad experience on this
year’s teams. Football next year
should be better than this year, for
Coach Snavely had to start the team
from inexperienced men. Basketball
iind baseball have been the major
sports at State and will without doubt
continue to occupy a relative high
place in State’s athletics.

BASEBALL

With the beginning ol‘ the baseball
season more men came out for prac—
tice than for either foot-ball or
basket ball. Every man worked and
did his best to make the Varsity nine.
'l‘hose who did not make the Varsity
team organized a second team and
State has plenty of Varsity and
second men as a result.

The nine has done some very good
playing this season, and while it has
not been a winning team, it has
played well.

The men playing for State are:
Rude, ’25, Caton, ’24. Gaiiior, ’26
Davies, ’26, Anderson, ’24, Juckett,
’25, Mac Mahon, ’26. Cassavant, ’24,
Casserrcttc, ’23, Roberts, ’25, Cole,
’25, Smith, ’24, Crane, ’24, Kcrshaw,
‘26, Stahlman, ’25, and Daley, ’24.

Rude and Gainor have twirlcd the
ball for State, and Anderson and
Juckett have stood behind the bat re-
cciving the "pill". The other men
have ﬁlled their places well and have
worked hard to supported the team
and win honors for State.

State’s nine has played some fast
teams. Among those played were
Vermont. Middlcbury, Union, and St.
Stephens. A feature of the schedule
this season was the Northern trip
when Vermont and Middlcbury were
played. The management of this
year’s team has been under John
Casscrrcttc.

VARSITY BASKETBALL
(Continued from page 4)
proved early in the season his ability
to pass and receive passes. Once
his eye was focused on the basket lie
seldom missed his aim. His height
and reach made him an excellent cen-

ter for State.

Pugh, Braun, Reilly.

l’ugh, Braun and lteilly while not
making the Varsity five, played good
games whenever occasion demanded.
l’ugh iind Braun, as forewards,
played fast and peppy games while
Reilly, as guard, formed an impen-
etrable wall to the advances of the
opposing team. Not making the
Varsity did in no way hamper this
playing and when they went on the
court to take a Varsity man’s place
they put their whole spirit into the
game.

Cheer Leaders.

State’s cbeerers this year have
been led by Stephen Merritt, ’25 and
Wilhelmina Hciiieinann, ’24.

“Steve” has brought forth volleys
of shouts from all sides, and “Billy”
has succeeded instirring up spirit and
pep when llli‘ else failed. “Billy”
can always cheer—even at a loosing
game.

Both leaders were able to get up
in front of the crowd and show it
how the thing should be done.

State has recognized “Billy” Heine—
mann’s ability, and she has been
elected College Cheer Leader for
next year.

INTERCLASS RIVALRY
lvcry year the freshmen and the
sophomores indulge in good-natured
rivalry from the very beginning of
the year until all scores are settled

on Moving-up Day in the spring.

College traditions are respected by
the entire student body and are
guarded carefully by each and every
student in the college. Wise is the
freshman who early finds out what
rules the college has laid down for
his observance in company with the
rest of her children or for his own
special observation and obediancc.

The lntcrciass Committee on Rules
(1923)} have made the laws, approved
by Myskaiiia, which govern all class
rivalry between freshmen and sopho-
mores. Thcre is no form of inter-
class rivalry permitted now except
the organized class contests, which
are to be carried on under the super-
vision of one or more members of
Myskania and which are outlined in
Section 1V of the code on lnterclass
Rivalry Rules. A point system has
been worked out and the score is
kept and announced on Moving-up
Day by a member of Mysknnia.

'l‘hese organized contests include:
all Campus Day activities, basketball,
baseball, cageball, challenging, bun-
ncr rivalry, mascot hunt, and Moving-
up Day activities.

Campus Day activities include ath-
letic events for the men and the wo—
men of the rival classes and compe-
titive stunts. The freshmen men play
the sophomore men in basketball
three times; tbehwomen of the rival
classes compete in basketball accord-
Ing to G. A: A. schedule. Victory in
either case is 2 points a game. Cage-
ball aml baseball games for women
will add lé paint to the score of the
Winning team's class, while the class
havmg the greatest per cent of mem-
bers present at these games will re-
ccive 1 point. One class must chal-
lenge the other to (1) a sing,r o r(2)
a debate during the first two months
of the second semester. Victory
means the addition of 2 points to the
winner’s score. The banners of the
rival under classes may be honestly
stolen, (Each class must have one by
December '1, for the rivalry cannot
begin until both classes have a

anner).

The women guard the banner first
semester; the men the second. Inter-
ference on the part of the men dur-
ing the time the women have the ban-
ner, or Vise vcrsa Will end this rivalry
and give 5 points to the class against
whom the offense was committed.
During the first full week in May,
the freshmen hunt the sophomore
mascot which is hidden somewhere
on. the Campus“ or in the Campus
buildings. Victory here is 5 points.
The night before Moving-up Day,
there is a tug of war for women
which counts 4 paints and a banner
rush for men which counts 5. The
sings on Moving-up Day night and
the aggregate points earned by either
class in the athletic events of the day
are added to the score.

Rivalry begins ordinarily after the
Get-Wise Party which the sophomores
give the freshmen before November
first_ and ends automatically on
Movmg-un Day, when the sophomores
become juniors and the freshmen
sophomores With the burden of show-
ing "the next year’s freshmen, the
way to go.”
