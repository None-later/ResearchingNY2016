Short bikes are scheduled for
around the city, but the hi»; event
of the hiking season is tie trip
to lnilinn Ladder. There is always a
trip to Indian Ladder in the fall, and
frequently another one in the spring;
one does not need any urging to go
again if she has gone once.
'l‘he girls leave the college in buses
in the morning so tl at they wil
have plenty of time to explore all
the dill'iirent places at the liadiler.
All the exercises and fresh air brings
back everyone who liiis gone out ex-
ploring for all the “hot dogs” and
rolls that they have brought with
them. Sometimes a few of the girls
stay over night and just camp out
under the stars. if you have never
spent a night in the open you don’t
want to miss the next overnight hike
to liidinii Ladder. ’l‘lie sunrise from
the top of the Ladder repays one for
all the dillleulties and hardships of

‘peets of coffee make you think
everything is right with the world.

So this year the loving cup will go

a 'Vursity team has not been looked?
upon with favor. but, now that the,

that in the future State College girlsl
will take their place with other col-i

’I‘he ’Varsity played three ganiosi
this year and showed great aliilityl
on the basketball court. The firstl
two games were against the Aluiiini’
of State Call The third game:
which was the first one ever pluyedi
against an outside team was with thoi
girls of Russell Sage. State was notl
victorious, but she did not make a:
bail showing for tho first time. Now}
that a ’Viirsity has been organized,‘
it probably will not be long before it
is scheduling games with other col-i

ADVANTAGES OF THE CAPITOL
DIS'I'RIC'I'

'l‘o the students at State College,
Albany affords many major advan-
toges and numberless minor ones.
When one thinks of Albany educa-
tionally, one thinks of the Education
lluildiiig, ii gateway to the finest
literature, the best source books, the
finest inspiration one could .fliid in
combination. One also thinks of the
Capitol, representing one of the high-
est types of political and governmen-
tnl centers in the United States, a
place oi‘ great interest and informa-
LIUII.

When one thinks of health, pleas-
iii‘o or coinl'ort one has but to con—
sider Washington Park, a place of
iieiiuty, composure, and enJoynieiit,
ior in this park one may sit on a
nench and look contentedly at the
green surroundings, blue sky, iind
iloivers; or one may go ii-hoating on

the inineuture lake; or one may
wonder along the paths or play
tennis. ’l‘ho park is one of Albany‘s

greatest iidrnntug s, and it is just
across the. street ironi college.

There an. other parks Wltll tennis
courts, swings iuid swimming pools.
'l’liore are stores .ol’ levoi'y variety
where commodities are not only do-
sirahle hut obtainable; and for those
of us who conserVe our energy by
riding there are stroot cars which
most oliligingly carry one, for seven
cents, to almost any part of the city.

What more to he desired?

 

 
 

NEW BUILDING FOR S’I‘A'I'E

Iliist year when we heard that iit
inst our anxious hopes iuid continu-
ous struggles of five years for more
land and new buildings were to cul-
minate in an increased amount of
land, we were incredulous. However,
iisi l'all we realized that our hope
was a reality, when we missed the
accustomed hill boards from their old
position west of the college. ' ow,
following last year's appropriation
for land, the legislature of “‘23 has
:zppropri funds to treat a group
i-I‘ huildin ~i on this land.

Among this group will he
nigh h.ll()0l ior practice
\Vltll :onsnltation rooms for the
'l'ics. This will ustoin the prac-
Li teachers to meet conditions of a
typi il, modern high school, and also
.‘elieve the congestion of college by
opening the third floor for college

The buildings will contain provis—

ion l'or lalm'atories of the Biology
and Home Economic departments as
well as recitation rooms for these
.I irtinents. This will increase the
iency of these departments and
facilitate research work. An audi-
torium will be included which will
accommodate the entire student body
at one time. This will be modeled
from the best of New York‘s “little
theatres." ' will be used for recit-
als ol.‘ the Music dcpaitment, plays
presented under the English depart-
ment, and student assembly, It will
also be in daily use for classes in
which instruction in play production
and acting is given. As a unit, the
buildings will contain thirty recitation
moms and fifteen aboratories. A
complete gymnasium will be included.
Thus we can play and entertain visit-
ing teams on our own court.
The remainder of the grounds will
come a part of the campus. It is
armed to fence it in and use it for
athletic field. Ground will be
)rokcn for these buildings iery Boon
tllil next fall may see the first story
rising.
