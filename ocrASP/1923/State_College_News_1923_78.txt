GIRLS’ ATHLETIC ASSOCIATION‘

The Girls' Athletic Association di-
rects all phases of women’s athletic
activities at State College. The club
is supported by nominal dues from
the active members and by a small
appropriation from the student tax
fund.

‘. . A. has been formed to aid
the girls in ﬁnding what they want
most in athletics and to stand back
oi‘ all organized games between indi—
viduals, between classes, and the
girls' intercollegiate i' s.

G. A. A. has branched out in every
direction and its energies are not

supports all of the sports because of
its desire to aid the college girls in
having a good time out-of-iloors.

A point system has been adapted
by means of which every girl inter-
cstedin athletics can gain her class
numerals or college letters. A credit
is given for every organized hike and
practice for any game and extra
credits are given for every game
played in. In this way credits are not
limited to just one sport, and it is
necessary to enter several if any
number ‘of credits are to he earned.
This year the number required has
been raised from seventy-five counts
to one hundred. So there is always
an incentive to gain either class
numerals or letters besides enjoying
the games as sports themselves.

At the end of the season a loving
cup is given to the champion basket
ball team. This is also true in re-
gard to tennis. for the girl who wins
the ﬁnal set in tennis receives a lov-
