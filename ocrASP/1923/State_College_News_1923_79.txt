Besides iill its other activities (l.

hikes. Short bikes are scheduled for
around the city, but the bi" evont
oi' the hiking season is tie trip
to lndiim Ladder. ’I‘here is always ii
trip to lndiiin Ladder in the fall, and
frequently another one in the spring;
one does not need any urging to go
again if she has gone oiico

The girls leave the college in buses
in the lilol’lilll”, so that they wil
iiiive plenty of time to explore llll
the . rat places at the Ladder.
All the exercises and fresh air brings
back everyone who has gone out ex—
ploring for all the “hot dogs” and
rolls that they have brought with
them. Sena-times a few of the girls
stay over night and just camp out
under the still ‘ you have never

sleeping on the ground and then the
prospects of coffee make you think
everything is right with the world.

The G. A. A. iiike to Indian l.ad«

no one is ever sorry that she has
gone even though it was just for the
day. and the joys of staying over
night Were omitted.

 

CHAMPION BASKETBALL TEAM

’l‘he laurels for the champion
hasketball team go this year to the
Junior Class. The girls on this team
have worked hard to make this team
the best in college, and besides gain-
ing the interclass eliinnpionship, sev-
o 'al oi? the sound were on the Varsity
team.

'l‘hesi- line results \vere due a gi'e'
deal to the enthusiasm and enemy
shown by the manager, llildi-gardo
Liobich, and the captain, Marion
Miller, who kept the girls inter stod
and brought them out to p 'aetic . l'
will be very dillicult and almost im—
possible to work up a competing
team next year that will take away
the laure " of the Junior Oh
they liavo the ability and ,vious
training to keep theln at the head of
the list for another yoar.

So this your the loving cup will go‘

to the Juniors and will remain with
them lor a time unless some better

team is worked up~—a feat WliiCll‘

seems quite improlaible althouin
even in athletics we do not know
what the future holds

 

STATE COLLEGE N

GIRLS' ’VARSITY

of the college there has been a girls'
’Varsity team this year. The idea of
a ’Varsity team has not been looked

ice has been broken, there is hope
that in the future State College girls
will take their place with other col-
‘leges on the basketball court.

The ’Varsity played three games
this year and showed great ability
on the basketball court. The first
two games we 2 against the Alumni
of State Colli ’l‘he third game
which was the .l 'st one ever played
against an outside team was with the
girls of Russell Sage. State was not
victorious, but she did not make a
bail showing for the first time. Now
that a ’Varsity has been organized,
it probably will not be long before it
is scheduling games with other col-
logos.

The following were the members
of the ’Varsity team for last year:

ADVANTAGES OF THE CAPITOL
DISTRICT

To the students of State College,
Albany affords many major advan—
tuges and numberless minor ones.
When one thinks of Albany educa-
tionally, one thinks of the Education
Iilllllllli“, ii gateway to the finest
literature, the best source books, the
finest inspiration one could find in
combination. One also thinks of the
Capitol, representing one of the high-
est types of political and governmen—
tal centers in the United States, a
place of great Interest and informa—
tioii.

When one thinks of health, pleas-
ure or comi‘ort one has but to con-
sider Washington Park, a place of
oeiiuty, composure, and eiiioyniciit.
ior in this park one niiiy sit on a
peach and look eontentedly at the
green surroundings, blue sky, iiiiil
iloWi. s; or one may go a-bontiiig on
tne niineature lake; or one may
wander along tin. paths or play
tennis. The park is one of Albany's
greatest inlvantages. and it is Just
across the street irom college.

"here other parks With tennis
courts, swmgs and swimming pools.
'l'here are sto' ‘ .ol? ‘cvery variety
where commodit s are not only do-
sirable but obtainable; and for those
0.1. us who conserve our energy by
riding there are street cars which
most oidigingiy carry one, for sovon
cents, to almost any part of the city.

What more to be desired'!

 

 

 

 

NEW BUILDING FOR STATE

Last year when we heard that at
last our anxious hopes and continu-
ous struggles of five years for more
land and new buildings were to eul—
minute in an increased amount of
land, we were incredulous. However,
last fall we realized that our hope
was a reality, when we missed tiie
accustomed bill boards from their old
position west of the college. Now,
following last year’s appropriation
for and, the le - ‘

 

 

1.. ature of ill2d has
appropriated funds to erect a group
of buildings on this land.

Among this group will be a model
nigh school for p 'actice teaching,
with consultation rooms for the
critics. This will accustom the prac—
tice teachers to meet conditions of a
typical, modern ii i school, and also
.‘elieve the con“ on of college by
opening the thiid floor for college
- asses.

The buildings will contain provis-
ion for laboratories of the Biology
and Home Economic departments as
well as recitation rooms for these
departments. This will increase the
efficiency of these departments and
facilitate research work. An audi-
torium will be included which will
accommodate the entire student body
at one time. This will be modeled
from the best of New York’s “little
theatres.” it will be used for recit—
sis of the Music department, plays
presented under the English depart-
ment, and student assembly. will
also be in daily use for classes in
which instruction in play production
and acting is given. As a unit, the
buildings will contain thirty recitation
moms and fifteen laboratories.
complete gymnasium will be included.
Thus we can play and entertain visit-
ing teams on our own court.

The remainder of the grounds will
become a part of the campus. it is
planned to fence it in and use it for
an athletic field. Ground will be
broken for these buildings \ery Soon
lilil next fall may see the first story
rising.
