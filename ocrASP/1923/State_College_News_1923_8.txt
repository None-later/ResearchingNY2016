the waste, either; its getting mighty
expensive." Ole finally got these
economy facts pounded into his head.

One day Ole was promoted to l'ire-
man. The day before he went on his
ﬁrst regular run on a freight engine
he was posted as to his duties through

iémusicnl program to be rendered by

the Letz String Quartet at Chancel-

girls’ chorus next furnished a treat
by rendering a carol—-“Mary’s
Lullaby” in which Mabelle Jochum-
sen, '23, sang the solo part, and a
song of the ocean, “The Breaking
Waves Dash High.” The song service
was closed by singing “College of the
