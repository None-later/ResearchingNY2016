STATE COLLEGE HISTORY
(Continued from page 1)

Soon the committee was organ-
izcd and the work distributed among
its members. Gideon Hawlcy secured
from the city of Albany the lease of
a building, together with $500, to
help pu: the property in order.
1"'ancis Dwight visited the school at
Lexington, to learn of its organiza-
tion and equipment. Dr. Potter
went to Massachusetts, empowered to
engage a principal. No time was
lost. The building was repaired and
equipped, a principal was secured,
and some teachers were appointed.
All was ready by December 18, 1.9111].
On that date the school was formallyl
opened by an address by Col. Young
before the executive committee, the
faculty, and the twenty-nine students
who had assembled the first day.
What is now Van Vechten Hall, on
State Street, east of Eagle, was the
fii.t home of the Normal School.
it was agreed that tuition and text-
books should be free, and that a
small sum of money to help pay
board bills should be furnished
weekly to each student. David l’er-
kins Page, a New Hampshire man,
was the first principal. He died
January 1, 1848, and George it. Per-
ins, professor of mathematics, was
the next principal. lle secured a
new site and a new buildinr, and
conducted the institution in a busi-
ness like manner till his resignation,
July H_ 1852. The new buildinr was
erected in the rear of Geologica Hall
on Lodge and Howard Streets, where
it formed the home of the normal
school till June, 1885. Samuel B.
Woolworth succeeded Dr. Perkins
and was a potent factor in the school
for twenty-eight years. His suc-
cessor, David H. Cochrane,

Civil War. In honor of those who
died in the service there is now

administration; building a. memorial

made by the alumni.

n 1864 Dr. Cochranc resigned and
was succeeded by Prof. liver Arcy.
From 1867 to .1882, Joseph Alden,

. ., . L. D., was president.
In 1882 Edward P. Waterbury,
Ph. D., L. L. D., was elected presi-
dent. For the first time in its history
the head of the institution was one
of its own g 'aduatcs. A new building
was secured as the old one was wholly
inadequate. This was erected on
Willett Street, facing Washington
Park. Into its Willis was wrought
some of the material of the old
capitol. Dr. Waterbury died in 1889.
That same year William J. Milne,
Ph. D., . L. D., became president.
He raised the standard of admission,
extended the course, and turned the
institution into a purely professional
school. I

'J‘HREEvLEGGED RACE—CAMPUS DAY

 

CAMPUS DAY

Campus Day is one of the several
events intended to bring the entire
college together for a seeial time.

In the morning, field events or.
held upon the college grounds: some
game like hockey between rival
classes, obstacle 'aces, relay races,
liazuir races. Representatives of the
classes compete for a prize to be
awarded by the queen of the day,
while their classmates cheer them on
to victory.

In the afternoon the scene is
changed to ltidgefield where the col-
lege men go forth to war on the
football field.

The evening finds the college again
assembled, this time in the auditor-
ium. The queen of: the campus, who
has \beeni chosen. by} popular vote,
with her attendants, takes charge of
the program. After songs and the
presentation of the prize, the day’s
jollities end with dancing in the
gymnasium.

lege life, the founding of Greek-
letter fraternities and athletic clubs;
the successful management of a col-
lege paper; the valuable lectures and
other entertainments provided each
year; grand organ recitals given by
the director of music; afternoon
seminars conducted by members of
the facility, and open to residents of
Albany and vicinity; a change of
name, “Normal College,”—these are
some of the events connected with
the administration of President Milne.
'l‘hese changes necessitated several
additions to the building itself.

in 1894 occurred the semi-centen-
nial jubilee. From all parts of the
United States they caine——-young
graduates of the new college! and
members of the first class of the old
normal school.

In 1914 Dr. Milne died and Feb-
ruary 1, 1.015, Dr. Abram R. Bru-
bacher became president, which posi-
tion he still holds.

At a meeting of the Board of Re-
gents April 30, 1914, it was voted:

“That the New York State Normal
College, which is continued under
that name by the Education Law,
may be further designated as the
New York State College for Teach-
ers; that the examinations heretofore
conducted in the New York State
Normal College of its graduates and
applicants for baccalaureate and
g'aduate degrees in arts, science and
pedagogy, be regarded and approved
as examinations by and for the
Regents of the University; that the

 

STUDENT ASSEMBLY

Poor little freshmen heads are
usually swamped with vague notions
of college studies, activities. and
t'aditioni. Among their hazy visions
of college life there often is a pic-
ture of some such ii boresome thing
as student assembly. Student as
sembly at State College, however, is
not a boresome affair.

Every Friday morning at 11:30
o’clock the students gather in the col-
loge auditorium to enjoy one of the
biggest, most i ' -' sting
hours of the week. The first meet-
ing is addressed by Dr. lirubacher
who makes the students feel at home
by his words of welcome. During
the year the program is varied
by Glee Club and Orchestra Concerts
as Well as by talks given by noted
speakers from within and without
the city.

One of the aims of State College
is to be a singing college. This aim
is carried out in assembly songs.
Students sit by classes and sing to
each other by classes. Then the
whole assembly unites in sing'ng the
praises to Alma Mater. 'l‘licsc singing
hours are among the happiest hours
at State College.

Student assembly is not only a
social occasion but a legislative
group as well. All matters to be
decided by student body are dis-
cussed in open form at these meet—
ings and then voted on by the as-
sembly. Election of all college
olliﬁers takes place in assembly, as

examinations be recognized and con-
firmed as duly earned degrees of the

be authorized to confer. in the name
and behalf of the Board of Regents,
the appropriate baccalaureate de-
grees of the University upon such
of the graduates of said college as
shall be found duly qualified there—
for; and that the University degree
of Master of Arts in education, and
other proper graduate degrees, be
likewise conferred upon graduates of
said college, and of other colleges and
universities, who shall duly earn the
same in graduate courses.”

In June, 1920, State held its 75th
anniversary celebration. In 1. .,
State College was admitted to mem-
bership in the American Association

of Colleges and Univcrmties.
