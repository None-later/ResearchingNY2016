MUSIC ASSOCIATION

In closing the second year of its
existence at State College the Music
Association would like to bring a few
facts to the attention of the college,
and attempt to clear away a mis-
understanding that exists in the
minds ‘of many of the students.

The misunderstanding is concern-
ing Music Association and Music
Club. Every student who pays his
blanket tux belongs to the Music
Association. It is the organization
which brings on the concerts that
have been presented during the
winter. It is an organization of the
entire student body, so far as that
body has shown its loyalty to its
Alma Mater by paying; its tax.

On the other hand the Music Club
is composed of some seventy-five
students who take a special interest
in music. The club meets iii-monthly,
and members of the club furnish the
programs. Any one may belong; to
the club who pays the annual dues
of twenty-five cents. .

Then there is the Music Associa-
tion Council. This is made up of
five students elected annually by the
music club, with Dr. Thompson and
Mr. Candlyn as faculty members.
This council of seven people directs
the affairs of both the Music Club
and the Music Association. A mem-
ber of the council ,with a committee;
appointed from members of thoi
Music Club arranges the programs
for the club meetings; another
council member, with a committee,
attends to the membership of the
club. while the council as a whole
brings on the artists, and gives the
concerts which are held each year.

And now the Music Association
feels that it owes to its members an
explanation of how the money which
they gave this year has been used.
To begin with. the Association
brought on two major outside enter-
tainments: the Lth Strng Quartet
in January, and the New York ’l‘r'
in March. Later the Association
secured Mr. Loniax who gave a lect-
ure on Types of the American Ballad;
and Os-Ke-Non-Ton, the Mohawk
Indian Chief, who entertained in con-
nection with a concert given by the
college chorus. Two weeks ago the
college chorus gave a concert in our
own auditorium, and in December,
under the auspices of the Music
Association, a Christmas Carol ser-
vice was held in the same place.
Besides all this, through Dr. 'l‘hompv
son’s efforts, the Association has
been able to y;ch the students three
dances after the concerts which have
been held in our auditorium.

Last fall the student body voted
to give the Association $650. but
because some students did not pay
the tax. that appropriation was cut
to $585. Professor Hidley informs
the Music Council that 703 students
paid their tax which means that each
student paid out for music 81 cents.

5

certs, one lecture and three dances,
which makes each of these entertain—
ments cost him 9 cents. The tickets
for both the Letz Quartet and the
New York Trio cost $1.50 to out-
siders. so that if students attended
only these two concerts they got
more than three times their money’s
worth. Could the student body have
invested their money better?

The Music Association Council
trusts that in the light of thesu facts
the student body will support them
next year in spirit and in finances

"STATE COLLEGE, ‘NEWS;

THE. FRESHMAN HANDBOOK

Freshmen entering; State College
have no occasion for bewilderment,
for their sister class each year pro-
vides a Freshman Handbook, as a:
source of information in “.274” them
a-rig‘lit. This handbook is not typical
of State College, but it is a publica-
tion that shows that State is wide
awake and on a par with other col-
logos in this respect.

The first handbook was published
and presented to the entering class
in liiIB-M by Y. W. C. A. It con-
tained, at that time, brief sketches
of college history. traditions, and
activities with a list of churches iind
religious societies in the city. Since
that time succeeding freshmen
classes have left their worries at
home for each year the little guide
book has appeared in a better, more
complete form.

In 1919, Y. W. C. A., having-
established the publication and
proved its necessity, withdrew from
its support and turned it over to the
Junior Class.

The last two isxuos of the hand-
book have not only contained college
information but also, information
about the City of Albany. Lists of
theatres, libraries, churches. and a
guide map have been included in the
book. The freshman cannot get lost
or lonesome as long' as he keeps this
little friend at hand.

As it first appeared the handbook
was a modest little page covered book
which looked like an ordinary incin—
orandum. The last issue, however.
was a modest little paper covered
book just “chuck full” of all sorts
of information for the Freshmen.
The class of 1924 gave the host pos-
sible book to the class of W26 and

DRAMATIC AND ART
ASSOCIATION

'l‘he Dramatic and Art Association
was founded in .1919 for the purpose
of arousing; a greater interest in dru—
inatics and the fine arts and of giving-
the students more advantages in both
these fields. The payment of the
student tax automatically makes each
student a member of the Association.
Thus it includes practically the entire
student body and insures to ovoi'yoni-
an equal share in the benefits de-
rived. The Association is financh
by an appropriation from (he studi-ni
tax fund.

The control of the organization
rests with the Dramatic and Ari.
Council of nine members, three fa.
culty members and two students from
each of the upper clas ~‘ The CUlIlI~
cil elects its own oil ' and trim»
sacts all the business of the Associa—
tion. The oil‘icers for 1923-1024 ili‘i‘
president, Dorothy V. Ilennlt, ’24;
secretary, Ole-a Hampel, ’26; trons~
urer, Mary Veddei‘, ’25.

The events put forth by the Assor-
iation this year have attracted much
attention. The big- feature was Ruth
Draper’ program in li‘olii'uiiry. The
three one act plays presented just
before mid-years were of unusual
interest.

Besules these the Association
brought to Cliancellors' Hull Mr.
Gerrlt Bencker, industrial artist, who
have a most interesting illustrated
lecture. During the second semi-stew
there has been a lecture on Starr
Scenery by Mr. Kenneth MacGowaii,
'amatic editor of the New York
Globe; two art exhibits, one water
color, the other photog'aphy. Miss
l’erinc gave a very instructive talk in
Student Assembly about the first
exhibit. The presentation of “The
White Headed Boy”, is the final
undertaking: of the Association.
Altogether it hi.- )(‘l'll : most suc-
cesstul year financially_ and the stu»
dent body and the city of Albany
have benefited greatly.

it has been the custom of tin-
Assocmtion to have a New York trip
dell year, but for the past tbrm»
years conditions have bi'en such that
the students could not plan one.
Next year, however, it is hoped that
a most eventful New York trip may

be had.
