mitory life. ’l‘he house is iit 1 Magic-
wood Place, facing beautiful Wash-

which governs the house activities
and aims to promote iriendliness and
good fellowship among the students.
House imnnbership is open to any
girl student who agrees to. the regu—
lations of the house organization.

 

“Y” HOUSE

For five years the State College
branch of the Y. W. . A. has pro—
vided a dormitory for its members,
commonly called the “Y” house. The
first one wa' at 31 So. Lake Avenue,
with Beulah Kittie '19, house presi—
dent, and Miss Marion Card, faculty
member. October 1, 1919 the second
house was opened at 747 Madison
Avenue. This house occomodated 19
girls and a house mother.

The “Y” house is the center of
many social activities, among which
was the annual house dance held last
April. .

As yet no house has been obtained
for next year, but it is expected that
there will be one which will occomo-
date about the usual number of girls.
’l‘he president for next year is Nellie
Maxim, ’24, and the other officers,
vice president, secretary, treasurer,
and reporter, vill be elected by the
new “household.” Applicants may

C'I‘UDIGN'I‘ HOUSES

NEWMAN HOUSE

’i‘hrough the generosity of Bisho:
Edmund F. Gibbons, Newman Club
now enjoys the privilege of a “New
man House." it had long been a
dream of the club to own a house,
and this year, “’22, brought the real-
ization of that dream. The house at
741 Madison Avenue formerly occu-
pied by Mr. Oscar J. Perrin, is seine-
thing more than a red brick house.
it stands for the fulfillment of all
the work, plans, and visions of New-
man mcmbers since the founding of
the club.

Although the house provides for
on 24 members, yet it is the
“home” of all the members. They
find a welcome there at all times,
and indeed, so warm a welcome is ex—
tended to them that already there is a
long Waiting list of applications for
permanent residence there. Applica-
tion is made to Rev. Joseph A. Dun—
ncy, the spiritual director of the club,
who in turn files the slips with the
'ecording secretary. A scheme has
on devised whereby there is even
class distribution at the house—six
Senior, six Juniors, six Sophomores,
six Freshmen being thus accommo-
dated. Consequently a certain
amount of class spirit and friendly
ii 'alry, which are among the fascin-
ating elements of college life, may
manifest itself.

Not only active members of the
club come to the house but college
memories are revived there for the
Alumni. It is at the houso that they
come together for the Alumni Meet—
ings held monthly. It is here that
they put on their entertainments, as
the bazaar of last November and the
lawn party which is yet to add its
hit to the list of the attractive things
planned and carr'ed out by the New—
man Alumni.

JUNIOR SISTER PLAN

The object of a Junior Sister
System is to relieve the feeling of
st'angeness to college life which is
felt by the entering Freshmen. In
the early summer each junior writes
to a future freshman, giving her
general information concerning the
college and the city of Albany, and
offering her service in helping the
entering student to get located and
to adapt herself to college life. Nor
does the relationship stop here for
each junior conducts her freshman
sister to the faculty reception given
in honor of the freshmen in Septem-
ber, while each sister class gives a
party to the other during the your,
thus continuing their friendly activ-

 

ities until the closo of the year.
