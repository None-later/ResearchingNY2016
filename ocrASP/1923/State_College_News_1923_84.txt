STATE COLLEGE NEWS.

JUNE 8. 1923

 

HISTORY OF STATE COLLEGE
NEWS

In 1010 a Committee of the Class
of 1918 on Publishing a Weekly Col-
lege Newspaper took the ﬁrst steps
toward establishing a weekly paper
at State College. The aim of the
newspaper as they stated it, was “ to
make each [action of our student
organization know and appreciate all
others, to uphold the maintenance of
fraternal regard and friendly rivalry
among all, to work for co-operation
between all sections and for thesolidi—
ﬁcatlon oi' the now separately wasted
energies in the promotion of a real,
distinct_ and enthusiastic spirit of
loyalty to State College.”

When college opened again in
1917, the News began to appear each
week. The work was under the
direction of Alfred Dcdicke who,
with a committee appointed by Presi-
dent Brubacher, began the publish-
ing of State's first newspaper. The
people who worked with Mr. Dedicke
Were: Dorothy Austin, Stanley
Heason, Eloise Lansing, Lillian Ma-
gilton, Joseph Walker, Henry Green-
blott, Kathryn Cole, Mildred Me
Ewan, Benjamin Cohen, Roy ’I‘own-
send, Maud Rose, Elmetta Van Deloo.

With the initation of the Student
’l‘ax plan of ﬁnancing student enter-
prises the ﬁnancial troubles of the
News disappeared, for the students
have each year voted their paper a
liberal appropriation. With the ad-
ditional help from its subscribers
outside the immediate student body
and the advertisements the Business
Manager and his assisstants obtain
each year_ the News finances have
become the least of its troubles.

 

When the war came, the News
Board was so broken up by the en-
listment of its members in service
that Myskania had to appoint a new
board. Many of the appointees had
been enthusiastic workers for the
News since it was first started. ’l‘hey
included Lillian Magilton, Kathryn
Cole. Mildred Mel'lwan, and Stanley
Henson as Senior lslilitors and Caro-
line [.ipes, Alfred Miller, Donald
'l‘ower, Dorothy Bonner, Bernice
Brenner aml Dorothy Wakerly us
Junior Reporters. The paper was
edited in rotation by a Senior Editor
and two Junior Assistants.

In 1910 the News established for
itself a regular board of editors
drawn from the Senior and
Junior Cl' : Editor-in-Chiel', Don-
nld ’l‘owcr, ’lil; Managing Editor.
Bernice Bi'onner, ’10; Business Man-
ager, Caroline Lipes, ’19; Assistant
Business Manager; Van Allen Lob-
dell, ’20; Associate Editor, Edward
Springman, ’20; Dorothy Banner, ’20
Kenneth Holben, '20, Bertha West.
‘20 and Elsie I-ianbury, ’20.

In 1.022, a News Board Constitu-
tion was drawn up. This constitution
provided for a board consisting of
four senior editors who hold the posi~
tions of editor-incchief, managing edi~
tor. business manager. and subscrip-
tion manager; not more than six jun-
iors who shall be associate editors,
if they are trying out for editorships,
or assistant business managers if they
are ‘tryingl for business places for
their Senior year, and, not more than
four sophomores who shall be listed
as reporters if they are trying for
editorial positions. Sophomores and
freshmen trying for business posi-

tions do not make the board until
their junior year. ii‘reshmen are
urged to try out for the News as
soon as they enter college in the fall.
Application for editorial work for
1023-1024 should be made to Dor-
othy Benoit. ’24, or to Mildred Kuhn,
’24, who are editor-in-chicf and inan-
aging editor respectively. Applica—
tion for a business position should be
made to Dorothy Jones, '24, who is
business manager.

In lil21 and .1922 the Press Club
gave pins to the senior members of
the News Board in recognition of the
work they had carried on so success-
fully for four years that they had
reached senior editor- or manager-
ships. Now the News Board itself
gives the pins to its senior members.
’l‘hese are presented on Moving-up
Day by the president of the college.

NEWMAN HOUSE
(Continued from page .11)

We may truly say Newman House
is the nucleus from which emanates
that spirit, the “Newman Idea"
which has made the club mean so
much for everyone—from the latest
freshman to the oldest alumna. New-
plan House has contributed its share
in making 1922-23 the crowning
glory?f the lgaand finale of all the
even u ant appy cars of Ne in
Club at S. C T. y w an

And next year under the guidance
of the new officers who are: presi-
d‘ent, Catherine Hall, ’24; secretary,
luleanor Gallery, '26; treasurer, Ag~
nes Murray, ’24; and critic, Gertrude
Lynch, ’26, we hope to make the
club motto, “Heart to heart” radiate
to everyone the love and loyalty
found under the grey and red of
Newman Club.

FINANCE BOARD

The finance board, which is com—
posed of student representatives from
each of the three upper classes, a
faculty member, and a treasurer, who
is also a member of the college fac—
ulty, makes out an estimate of the
amount of money that will be needed
to carry on the work of the college
organizations which are subsidized
each year by the student funds.
Each of these organizations presents
a budget to the finance board, and it
is from these the board estimates the
total amount to be raised and the
individual student blanket tax. The
entire budget must be approved by
the student body before the finance
board may begin to collect the tax.
Each student, upon paying his tax,
receives as student tax ticket on
which he is admitted to home games,
concerts, plays, lectures, and all the
other entertainments that are pro—
Vided by those organizations which
benefit by the student fund. This
method of financing general college
activities has proved very successful
and has met with the approval of
the students.
