academic year to take up his new
work. He also acted as director of
the Summer is ion at the College

in speaking of Dr. Horncr’s re-
tirement from the deanship of the
State College, President Abram It
Brubacher said:

“'I‘he State College for Teachers
is giving its best in giving up Dean
Homer to the service of all teachers
of New York State. His depar are
from State College can be jus 'fied
solely on the basis of a greater need.
He will devote his splendid energies
to the professional interests of more
than 50,000 teachers. He will find
a loosely organized body, with its
professional interests poorly defined,
ith very little professional solidar~

ity With his organizing ability and
hi ability to arouse enthusxasm in
hi audiences, I confidently expect

 

to see our State Teachers Association
grow into a truly professional body
that has pride in its work, cohesion
in its membership, and dclinitene‘ss
in its professional purposes. This
will be a. great achievement for the
new Executive Secretary, and few
could hope to accomplish these re-
sults.

As Dean of the College, Harlan
Horner made himself indispensable
to me personally. He organized the
work of his office with great effic—
iency; he served the student body
with sound professional advice; he

 

brought real human qualities to his

 

MILNE HIGH

Milne High School, a vital part of
State College, is at once the training
school of a large per cent of New
York State’s proficient teachers and
of from two to three hundred high
school students.

The high school offers four
courses: Classical, College I‘I'epnm-
tory, Scientific, and Commercial.
Instruction is under the immediate
care of the college seniors, closely
supervised through daily plans and
inspection by expert teachers. As
a result, the Milne students profit
by an incomparable combination ol’
the enthusiasm and eagerness of
highly specialized youth and of the
res raining and broadening influence
which comes with years of exper-
ience in the service.

Naturally under such conditions
the scholarship of Milne is high. The
Regents system of examination pre—
vents any deterioration in academic
standing through experimentntion in
new and improved methods. A whole—
some competition is stimulated among
the students by honors offered in the
various departments. A regulation
regarding membership in too many
organized sch'ool socieiits prevents
the ineffective dissemination of the
pupil's energies. Four literary soc-
ieties and the editing of a school
paper furnish means for extra-curri-
culum activities.

To maintain the moral plane of the
school a certificate of cha‘aeter is
required from all entering students.

In the very near future, through
the fulfillment of a long cherished
plan, the erection of a sepa'ate and
complete up~to—dnte building will
supply the last rmuirement in mak-
ing Milne a model high school.

daily task. As organizer of our Sum-
mer Session he displayed executive
qualities of very hiin rank. ’I‘hese
are services of great value to the
college and we can ill ail‘ord to lose
him. It is only because all the teach-
ers of our state need him that I am
reconciled to his going from us.”

THE CO-OP

'I‘hc State College Co-op is a very
busy place in the course of the col-
lege year, and it continues to be So
during the Summer Session. In the
fall of 1920 a small bookshop was
established in the college more or
less as an experiment. Immediate
popularity among the students insur—
ed its need of expansion, so that at
present cvorything from hair nets to
French dictionaries may be obtained
there. 'I‘hose who are guests of State
.lollege during the summer will find
it enjoyable and convenient.

THE CAFE- (TERIA)

'l‘he Cafeteria at State College is
a most inviting place with its sunny
windows and bright flowers. Meals
may be obtained here at a reasonable
price. This year the class in foods
will furnish labo‘atory products for
use in the Cafeteria in addition to
the food provided by the regular
lunch room force. 'l‘he excellent
management of the Zai‘eteria is the
standard of the Home Economics
Ihvpartment of the College. The
(.‘nferteria will be open during the
Summer Session for the convenience
of students.

my life foolin’ ’round no college,”

“Might I understand you," said the

the Lord for your ignorance?"

“You may put it that way if it
suits you any better," snapped the
