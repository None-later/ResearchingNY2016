DEPARTMENTS

MUSIC Istudy of art, including sculpture,}

The aim of the Music Department
at present is not to train music tench-
ers but to give all the students of the
college a chance to hear fine music
and to take part in it. A chorus 01'
about a hundred women’s voices, a
men's glee club, and an orchestra
have achieved excellence rarely at-
tained by amateur organizations.
From the courses in music apprecia-
tion and in harmony students learn
to compose songs and instrumental
compositions; on Moving~up Day this
year all four classes presented orig—
inal songs, and at the spring concert
two original numbers were played by
the orchestra.

Besides the delightful and truly
remarkable achievement in creatingl‘
and interpreting music, mention
should be made of the pleasure pro-
vided for all in a series of noteworthy
concerts. This year the Music Assoc-
iation, under the supervision of the
Music Department, presented a
Christmas Carol Concert, the Letz
Quartet, the New York ’l.‘rio, a win-
ter concert with Chief Os-Ke—Non-Ton ,
Professor John Lomax in a lecture1
on Negro Spirituuls, and a spring
concert by all the college musical or-
ganizations. In addition to these for—
mal concerts the department provides
music for assembly sings and other
college parties,

his year, under the editorship ofl
Professor Candlyn and a board ofi
student editors, the Music Associa-l
tion has compiled an excellent songl
book published by Gray and Novello,‘
one of the most important firms in
the English—speaking world.

Individual talent in singing is en~l

  

couraged and developed. Pro or
'l‘liompson gives free vocal Ii as
to a number of students every I

yeii'.
As an example of the result of his
training we'miglit cite Edna Sliafer,
’24! who holds the most important
solo church position in Albany, that
of alto soloist in the First preshy~
terian Church.

Both instructors in music are
known throughout the country. Din,
Harold W. Thompson is Dean of they
American Guild of Organists andl
contributing editor of the journal of‘
the National Association of Organ-l
ists ;he is author of a “Choirmaster’s ‘
Guide” and is a leading American
authority on ecclesiastical music.
Mr. ’1‘. Frederick H. Candlyn, Mus. B.
is well known in America and Eng:

 

land as a composer; his many compo-.
sitions are published by Gray, Novello l
Schirmer, Ditson, Schmidt, and the:
Boston Music Co. He has composedl
a number of things for the collegel
chorus. 'In 1919 he received the
gold medal of the American Guild
of Organists.

PHILOSOPHY

This department aims to present
instruction in the main subjects us—
ually classed as philosophical, includ-
ing psychology, which, altho not
strictly philosophical as treated, is
nevertheless a precondition of all
philosophical pursuits.

The aim of philosophy is a rational
and systematic comprehension of ex-
perience and reality. It seeks to
transcend the knowledge of the
special sciences, and to unify and
emulate all knowledge; it aims as
universal interpositiVe principles, at
final truth and reality.

Aesthetics seeks a philosophical in-

; l.

lpninting, architecture, music and the
ldrama, with the effort to reach phil-l
losophic principles by which all art is‘
to proceed and be elevated.

It is a highly enjoyable course.

Ethics, is a study of the funda-
mental prinicples of the moral life.l

study is made of the p 'acticall
moral life and institutions, with t
final determination of the principles
upon which the science rests. Ethics
crowns every problem of life, and it
is hard to conceive of a more import-
ant field of study.

Epistemology and Metaphysics may
be called the two hemispheres of phil-
osophy. in every experience we have
the antithesis of thought and thing,
knower and known. ’l‘hesc facts
present the two perennial problcns

l
l
l

 

of philosophy: the problem of know
ledge and problem of reality. These
subjects furnish the respective goals
of all philosophic thought. 'l‘hey
furnish the student a world-view un-
attainable in any other way.

The history of philosophy is the
history of human thought, i
history that should transcend in inter—
est all other human achievements.
We here follow the course of ancient
Greek thought through its marvelous
evelopement into its,flowering cul-
mination in Socrates, Plato and Aris-
otlo.

We become familiar with the spirit
and method of the middle ages, and
finally with the ,‘sweep ,of modern
thought which has culminated in the
tenets of our own day.

'l'he courses in philosophy in them-
selves, when thoroughly mastered,
offer a liberal education.

GOVERNMENT

The Government Department aims
to turn out intelligent and well-
informed teachers of American Gov-
ernment who will aid in the. high
schools in training and developing
better citizens. Many interesting and
valuable courses are offered with the
paramount object of teaching govern-
ment as a set of principles rather
than as innumerable facts. There are
two coursr given dealing with the
constitutional history of the United
States, one dealing with the origin
and development of our federal sys-
tem, the origin and theories of the
constitution, the rise of parties and
starting of federal banks, and all
other matters of constitutional impor-
tance occurring before 1860; the
other dealing with constitutional de-
velopment from 1860 to the present
times. Parallel to these are two
courses treating with the constitu-
tional history of England, which, is
studied for the purpose ‘of showmg
the sources of the American system
of Government, and for comparison
of the English with the American
system. Other very valuable courses
are:——a study in the fundamental
principles of state, city, county and
town government, a detailed study of
the Government of the State of New
York, a political science course, and
a course in constitutional law.
courses in this department are taught
by Professor Hutchinson, who has
been the instructor in Government at
State College since 1908. Professor
Hutchinson has obtained master’s dc-
gi'ces from both McGill, his Alma
Mater, and Harvard, and» prior to
coming to State was an instructor

 

 

vestigation of the science of the beau«
tiful. We here make an inductive

at Union College.

‘one-half year of oral English and

MATHEMATICS

The aim of the Mathematics De-
partment is to turn out efficient
teachers, who will have a thorough
understanding and knowledge of the
fundamentals of mathematics.

Among the courses offered are two
one‘semoster courses required of all
freshmen, courses in higher mathem-
atics. and instruction in the teaching
of high school pupils.

Professor Birchenough, A.
Pd. 13., graduate of Cornell is the
head of the department. He is as-
sisted by Prof. Uonwcll, A. 13., A. M ,
Rh. 0., a member of Phi Beta Kappa,
a graduate of Princeton University,
and an instructor in Yale University
from 1908—1915; and by Dr. De-
Porte, A. B., A M., Ph. 1)., graduate
of the University of Oklahoma.

ENGLISH

The English Department has a
three-fold purpose :——to teach its
people to know and appreciate liter«
ature of all types and times, to repre-
sent literature iii declamation and
dramatization, and to create litera—
ture in public speech and in writing.

The English and American Litera-
ture courses, offered by Dr. Hastings
and Dr. Thompson respectively, aid
in cultivating a refined literary taste,
and thus develop ability to apprec-
iate good literature. In these courses
attention is given not only to the
literature itself but also to the life
of the outliers of various periods, the
customs of the people and the gen»
eral settings of the productions. A
Shakesperinn Course and courses in
modern poetry and prose likewise de~
velup a taste for worthwhile work.

Oral English occupies an import-
ant place in our English Department.
All freshmen are required to take

those who are the most able repre-
sent the class in declamation contests
held in May. Besides this required
course, three courses in Dramatics
are offered, one dealing with a study
of modern drama, and the other two
treating with the principles of stage
lighting, directing make-up and pro-
duction. The elementary dramatics
course closes with three plays stagedl
in January, while the advanced dra-'
matics course gives presentations ofl
one-act plays every three or fouri
weeks under the direction of the stu-‘
dents, supervised by the instructmzl
A full length play, directed by they
supervisor, is presented in May byl
the advanced dramatics class. This
course will be offered next year for
the first iime. Miss Futtei‘er, a for-
mer graduate of State and a person
of recognized talent conducts drama-
tics. A public speaking course, given
by Dr. Thompson, is also very valu-
able for training in delivering short
and original speeches of various types
A new course, a debating course, will
be conducted next year by Dr.
Thompson.

The students, who are talented in
original literary production, are aided
to develop this talent by an advanced
composition course supervised by
Professor Kirtland, the head of the
English Department. Professor h'irt—
land has been an instructor at State
since 1909. Before coming to State
he served as superintedent of schools
at Houghton, then at Flint, Michigan.
Professor Kirtland is a graduate of
the University of Michigan and has
received his master's degree from the
Univorsity of Chicago.

 

 

THE LATIN AND GREEK
DEPARTMENT

The Latin and Greek Department
plans not so much a technical study
of these languages as it aims to
create an appreciation of the literary
value of old Greek and Roman
Classics. 'I‘o thoroughly understand
and appreciate the later day litera—
ture, the literature of those people
who spread the culture of the world
must first he understood and appre~
ciated. The statement that “All
roads lead to Rome” is as true today
in the field of literature as it was fig-
uratively true years age, for Home is
the source of all culture, a culture on-
richnd and refined by its contact
with the Greeks. The study of old
clas'ics, then, gives us inforimition in
regard to the origin and setting of
literature in its primitive stage, as
well as furnishing as valuable liis~
torieal knowledge of those l'lll'lV
times and peoples. ’l‘hese classics
are rich in humor, beauty, and the
philosophy of life, as certain extracts
from Horaees “ Odes ” or Cicero's
“De Senectute” prove. 'l‘o trans—
form these ideas into a language of
many later generations wiLlioul. in-
juring the beauty or losing the
thought content of the original, thus
gaining knowledge of ancient litera—
ture and its producers and incidently
understanding the technique of that
literature is the aim of the liatin and
Greek Department. Works from
Xenophon, Plato, liluripides, Cicero,
Horace, Virgil, ’l‘acitus, Catullus,
Lucretrus, and other noted authors
are read by students majoring or
minoring in the class s.

Dr. Leonard W0 ds Richardson
has been the head of this department
at.State College since 1805. Dr.
Richardson graduated from ’I i '
wth both a bachelor’s and ma.
degree, and has obtai ed his (legion
in philosophy from Griswold College.
He served, first as an instructor, then
as a professor at ’l‘rinity before com—
ing to State College. Several
articles have been written by him
for publication. Miss Johnson and
Miss Wallace, former graduates of
State, any assist Dr. Richardson in
his work in the department.

 

    

 

EDUCATION

It is the purpose of the Depart-
‘iient of Education to develop in its
students the correct point of view
toward their pro ession as future
nigh school teachers. ’I‘hrough their
early, first band View of classroom
conditions gained through experience
in Milne High School, they are
trained to meet effectively problems
of a modern high school. The de-
partment emphasizes an understand-
ing of the attitude of the young
teacher to her fellow instructors, to
her pupils, to her superiors, and to
the community at large. As a re-
sult students of State College have
preeminently good results be-
cause of their knowledge of class
room procedure. In fine, the entire
department tends to develop the
right motives in the teacher, and to
give her a background of proper
training.
