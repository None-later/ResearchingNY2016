ART

The courses in Fine Arts are de-
signed to arouse an interest in the
arts, as history, literary and culture
subjects.

in Art History an acquaintance is
made with the causes for the rise,
development aml decline at the var-
ious art periods. These facts are
illustrated by the study oi? the works
01' the great masters, who have vitally
contributed to the progress 01' the
aesthetic development of the ages.
'l‘hese courses are closely allied to
the history and literature of the
times and create a concept ot‘ the
character 01‘ art. i ods, thru a study
elf the valuable visual record of their
people.

'l'he courses in Art Criticism and
Interpi. ition are planned to train
the appi' ciative facilities thru an
exaniinatimi of museum exhibits and
trips to churches, cathedrals, and
local collections. in both of these
cours s use is made of the splendid
eollec ion oi? slides of the New Yer
State Education Department, as well
as those of .red through New York
City galleri-s. Once each year an
opportunity is offered to visit the
Metropolitan Museum of Art and
other galleries in New York City
under the leadership of the
instructor.

.'l‘hes(, courses are open to all stu—
dents who show a desire for an earn-
est study of this l'ield of development.

Other courses in art place the
emphasis upon appreciation thru
doing. The course in Art Structure
is til.l nod for the beginner. It
teaches an intelligent use at the
knowledge oi‘ drawing thru the culti-
vation of the powers to appreciate
l'iiie qualities in proportion, arrange-
ment, and color. ’l‘his course does
not pro—suppose either skill or talent
in drawing. but ks rather to en-
courage latent ability, and to teach
those who have little i'aith in their
“gift to draw” how the laws of
beauty may be simply and directly
applied to everyday problems. Art
Structure is open to all students. it
should he ol‘ interest to any pros-
pective teacher whose work leads into
the various terms of visual instruc-
tion, chart work, blackboard il'aw—
ing, mounting and hanging exhibits,
simple poster work, printing, and
principles of house decoration and
costume design.

’l‘hree advanced cours
ing, handwork, and ( _
opportunity for many apphc tions at
this [undimental cours in Art
Structure, Such con 5 are opt-n
only to students who. preparation
has been sufficient to eiiahle them to
benefit by such advanced problems.

As a result 0C these courses three
of the art students, Dorothy Bennit.
’24 Marjorie 'iiivingston, '25 and
Eleanor Jones have, during the year,
won prizes for pesto" offered by
commercial organizations.

Ethel Cummings, '23. was chosen

from this department to design the
cover for new song book the
Music ; ssociation brought out this
year.
The Art Department is conducted
by Miss Pcrine, who, by her exper-
ience. persistent eiTort. and extended
traveL both in this country and
abroad has added to her fund of
knowledge an intimate acquaintance
with the leading art centers 01' the
worh .

During the past year conside‘ablc

STATE COLLEGE NEWS,

The first semester of Physics I was
devoted to the study of the elemen-l
tary wireless. The various hooks-up:
were studied and an opportunity \vasi
given to set up the various sets aiidi
to test th -m in actual use. .ll‘ollowing1
‘ ' ' e there is a more ailvanced.
course in which wireless may bei
taken up more in detail. 1

Besides the 'arious experimental,
sets used in the laboratory, there isi
in operation an excellent vaeuuni.‘

conection with the loud speaker re-i

One more course has been added
to those ol'l'ered by the appurtnwntw
’ his is a course in elementary}
physics which will be open only to‘
those who have not had high school
physics. "iis will give an oppor-
tuni;y for those who have not yet
had l’hysics to get the elementary
part ol' the subject.

GERMAN
The primary purpose of the Ger-
man department is that of other de—

 

 

partments of our institutions, vizwio
prepare 'l‘eachers For high school
work. With the new and the dropp-
ing of German I'rom many hi h
schools, this aim has been made sec-
ondary to the consideration that
most students new studying (ii-rnuui
do not export to teach it, but are
taking German as part of their re-
quirements i'or lllt' degree which they
Si‘i'k. ’l‘he spoken lang .' is not
emphasised so much as formerly.
More attention is given to develop—
ing the ability to read German with-
out the constant use of the diction-
ary. All American universities still
require candidates for the doctorate
to demonstrate their proficency
in reading French and German.,
Many colleges and universities
have the same requirements for the
ma. ’5 degree, while all require a
reading knowledge in one at th( '0
two languages. Harvard requires
undergruduates to pass an ' '
tion in French and Germa . ’l‘he
high schools are gradually resuming
the teaching of German so that In
time the department will be con-
ducted for the same purpose that
was foremost before the war.

 

 

 

   
 

 

 

  

LIBRARY SCIENCE
A library, essentially, is intended
to be of indispensable service to the
community which it serves. 'l‘h’e

tion. it is the tool of every depart-
ment, and promotes industry, enter—
prise. and individual advancement. .
Recognizing the place of the h-
brary in the high school, and the
need for teachers who can take some
classes and spend part of her time in
the library. the library courses are
offered. These courses have for
their purpose the familiarizing of the
student with books furnishing infor-
mation and guidance, the wise selec—
ltion and economic buying of books,
in knowledge of systems of catalogu-i
.'ng. the ability to plan and arrange:

HISTORY

Eighty per cent of our college stu—
dents study h story for the last time
during the lr nnan year. For this
reason, we try to give the freshman
a bread background, knowh-

   

L

 

l'aets, together with interpretation,‘

connection of '-nts, the human ele—
ment of history, authoritative sources
of information. and, modern. appli-
cation. We hope to create citizens
with fairly ane patriotism.

These who elect history, study, not
only with the idea that some may
become scholars. but; with the prac—
tical notion of teaching history.
’l‘heir courses are determined largely
by the subjects they must teach in
the high schools of New York State.

Many develop a “historical mind,”
keep up enthusiasm for historical
truth, and become patriotic teachers,
who are of real service in the com-
munity.

We believe that history is a most
interesting study ol.‘ humanity. and
we try to prepare teachers and stu-
dents ot‘ history for human service.

lare subsidiary to it; in which case it
might not be inappropriate for him
