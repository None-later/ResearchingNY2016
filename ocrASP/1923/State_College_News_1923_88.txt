STATE COLLEGE PRESIDENTS

The story of State College is in-
complete without the story of that
line of sturdy, stalwart. educators who
have sat in the executiVe chair and
in their wisdom guided the policy of
the institution. The story begins
with the work of the principles of
the New York State Normal School.

David Perkins Page of Newbury—
port Mass. upon the recommendation
of oraee Mann, was selected to di-
rect the affairs of the new normal
school in 1894. Under his direction
the institution was firmly established.
As an educator Dr. Page looked :far
beyond most of his contemporaries.
His book “Page’s Theory and prac—
tice of Teaching” is widely known
and used even today.

In January. 1848 George R. Per-
kins, L. L. 1)., professor of mathema-
tics took Dr. Page’s place. Dr. Per—
kins first energics wore directed to-
ward the task of securing; a new site
and building. Needless to say he was
successful in his efforts. In 1852
Dr. Perkins resigned to accept a posi-
tion as mathematician of the calcu—
lation commission which was arrang-
ing for the consolidation of the lines
of railroad betwoen Albany and Buf-
falo to form the New York Central
Railroad. He also had charge of the
building of the Dudley Observatory.
in 1862 he was honored by election
to the regency of the University of
the State of New York.

After many years service in the
Homer, N. Y.. Academy, Samuel B.
Woolworth, L. L. D., was elected in
1.852, principal of State Normal
School. Dr. oolworth served the
institution faithfully for twenty-eight
years and finally in 1856 he resigned
to become secretary of the Board of
Regents.

David H. Cochran, A. M., Ph. D.,
succeeded Dr. Woolworth. Dr. Coch-
ran came to the institution with years
of experience as an educator. He
brought to his new position all the
energy and enthusiasm that had made
his proceeding career successful. in
1864 he was invited to accept the
presidency of the Polytechnic Insti-
tute and resigned to assume the
duties of his new position.

His successor, Oliver Arey, A. M.,

Williams College and president
Jefferson College. He was a wr
on educational subjects. For inf
teen years he directed the affairs of
the institution and when he finally
resigned in 1882 it; was under great
protest that his resignation was
accepted.

The second president. Edward P.
Waterbury, Ph. D., Li. D., was a
member of the executive committee.
For the first time in its history the
head of the school was one of its
own graduates. Preceding his elec—
tion Dr. Waterbury was connected

was the man who had made Buffalo
Central School celebrated. it was"
his work in that school that built up;
his reputation for him.

Joseph Allen‘ D. D., L. L. D., wasi
elected as the first president in 1867,;’
following Prof. Arey's resignation.
Dr. Allen had been a professor in

  

with the Massachusetts Mutual Insur-
nnce Company. During his adminis-
tration appropriations for a new
school building were made. The new
building. modern in all its appoint-
ments was erected.

' entered upon his duties in 1885). Dr.

Milne had been engaged in teaching
all his life. For eighteen years he
had served as head of the school at
Geneseo. One year after his accept-
anee of the presidency the Albany
Normal School became chartered as
a Norile College. The institute was
defined as a professional institution
in which nothing is studied or taught
that does not bear directly upon the
business of teaching. Dr. Millie also
published during his life a series of
text books on mathematical subjects.
'l‘hesc texts are used today in many
high schools thru-out the state and
are everywhere considered of the
highest type. Dr. Milne's death was
greatly lamented. in June 1914 the
college set aside a time for a memo—
rial scrvice to him. His memory is
kept alive today in the Milne High
School which was named in his honor.

Dr. Milne was succeeded in 1914
by the present president Dr. A R
Brubacher. Dr. Brubacher is a grad-
uate of the class of 1897 of Yale
University. In 1902 he received his
doctorate from that same institution.
Dr. Brubacher came to the State
Normal College after service as in-
structor in Greek in Yale College,
as principle of schools in Gloversville
and Schenectady and as superintend-
ent of schools in the latter city. He
is the author of several texts among
which are “High School English".
volumes one and two. "English, Oral
and Written" and a series of readers
entitled “The Spirit of America.”
He has recently contributed articles
on education to the Atlantic Monthly
and to various educational periodicals
and Written.” and a series of readers
and to various educational period-
icals. Since- his acceptance of the
presidency he has been directing his
efforts toward a study of the teaching
personality and has been cndeavoring
to put teacher training and the selec-
tion of teacher recruits on a more
scientific basis.
