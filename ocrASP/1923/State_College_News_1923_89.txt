STATE COLLEGE PRESIDENTS
(Continued from page 16)

During,r his administration the col-
lege has made rapid advances. The
first task accomplished was the re-
organizing of Hi: faculty on a college
basis in 19.15. The establishment of
professorships and assistant profes-
sorships and a corps of instructors
was the result of this movement. The
establishing of a regular salary scale
with a minimum of $2,500 and a
maximum of $4,500 hiis been accom-
plished (luring Dr. Bruluichei"s presi-
dency. A purchase of two and a
quarter acres of land has been made
also, one half of whicii will be used
['0' a group of buildings for reeitn-
tions and laboratories and one half
for an athletic field. Dr. llrubach-
er's interests are all centered in the
welfare of State College and under
his administration greater things are
comin)’.

CHEMISTRY
Chemistry in its origin was proli-
iihlv an Egyptian art. its history
may be traced through many nations;
about the time of the F'rench Revolu-
tion it was called the French Science;
later it became German. The neces-
sities of war. however, again changed
its course, and it is now becoming

American.

Chemistry was a bulwark between
civilization and German domination.
It served us well in war, and peace
was hastened quite as truly by Amer—
iciui chemistry as by American
troops. i

The oﬂiccs of chemistry in peace
are less spectacular but no less vital
than in war. A nation that witholds
its appreciation and its development
of chemistry is ill fitted to compete
industrially with its more progressive
neighbor.

‘It is probably true that the chief
difference between. anoient and con-
temporaneous eivdization is the sci-
ence of the present. Man is prob-
ably not superior in intellect, art or
civilization to the man of ancient
Greece or Reine. He is, however,
more comfortable and he lives longer.
Through the product of the test tube
and crucible he now may Cl‘iJOW the
luxuries of the ancient royalty. and
countless more then undreained of.

PHYSICAL EDUCATION

Althou h the major and minor
courses n physical education have
been done away with, the colic re still
recognizes the value of physicaltrain-
ing in the life of its students. For
freshmen and sophomores gymnasium
work is compulsory; for upper-class-
inen it is a matter of choice, and
works mostly in extra-curriculum
activities such as hockey, basketball,
cagebull, and track.

The department contributes exten-
sively to the social life of the col—
lege through the Girl’s Athletic Asso-
ciation, which plans and carries out
hikes and gym frolics, and assists in
making intereting the athletic events
oi‘ Campus Day and Moving-up Day.

Without Dr. Croasdiiie the work
oi' the department would be de-
cidedly incomplete. Her hygiene lec-
tures, physical examinations, common
sen. advice, hei- well-rounded and
vigorous personality gives the cour-
age to go on living to the very hard-
(..i; worked people.

   

SPANISH

Among the inte'- ting courses
offered by the Spanish department
are: vi 'course in South. American
history. a study of the Spanish
poetry of South America, a course in
Spanish literature, and a course in
conversational Spanish.

The Spanish club is one of the
most active departmental .' "ties in
College. of which the Spanish Car-
nival, given under the auspices of the
club, is a witness. 0 rather wonder
if something of the Cilll‘ilctcl'lstic
Spaniin cleverness and gracefulness
is acquired by the members oi' the
club through their study of the na-
tion's song and dance. One would
think so, judging from the delightful
exhibition they give every spring.

BIOLOGY DEPARTMENT
(Continued on page 20)

Friday, June first. saw the lockers
emptied, slides scrubbed for the last
(or was it the ﬁrst") time and a few
remnants of cover glasses returned
to the supply table. It saw three
hundred or so joyous persons passing
out and bearing with them “care‘
fully bound and indexed,”somewhat
sanguinary note books containing
more or less remotely usable infor-
mation—which we hope is not en»
tirely concealed within. More im-
portant than this, how , we trust
that they were also c ‘ying with
them open minds, observations a
little kccnc rthan before, joy in the
contemplation of living things, so
alike in their physiological processes
and yet so diil‘erent in their forms,
their adaptations, their reactions.

Three introductory courses have
been given, simple courses, requiring
little previous preparation. General
Biology was oil'ered for students who
intended to go no further and wished
some knowledge of botany and zo-
ology. Elementary courses were also
offered in General Botany and Gen-
eral Zoology, designed to acquaint
the students with the fundamental
principals of biologic science and
methods of scientiﬁc procedure.
‘hese courses have led to more ad-
vanced work in these respective sub-
jects, with more emphasis on the in-
formational side. Four couscs in Phy-
siography supplemented this work.
Those who still survived the period
of rigors of laboratory routine were
rewarded in their senior year by the
courses in Evolution and Methods of
Teaching.

The identiﬁcation course was not

INFIRMARY PRIVILEGE

’l‘Iie ini'irmury privilege is one of
the advantages State College offers
her students through the cooperative
’action of the students themselves. A
itwo dollar tax, included in the stu—
.dent‘ tax, is levied upon every individ-
ual the returns of which are pooled,
laud placed at the disposal of Dr.
iCroasdalc, who has authority to semi
Eany student in need oi” medical atten~
tion to one of the Albany hospitals.
Expenses are defrayed or lessened by
a twenty—five dollar payment from
the ini'irmary fund.

’I‘hose who know the expense of a
college education can appreciate what
:such assistance may sometimes mean.
"l‘he infirmary privelege has relieved
more than one student from a sud—
den, iind what might have been an
over-whelming burden.

 

1923 REUNIONS

In Senior Class Meeting on June 1,
[923 decided to hold her class re-
unions the ﬁrst, third, ﬁfth, seventh,
and tenth years after graduation.
After 1923 has been out ten years,
the interval between reunions will be
increased to ﬁve years.

Members of 1923 intend coming
back on Alumni Day every year
it is at all possible. The class belives,
however, that an organized reunion
in deﬁnite years will attract more
people back those years because they
will be sure of ﬁnding a great num-
ber of old class-mates there and may
expect a really true-friendly social
time.

1923 hopes that other classes will
follow her example in chosing these
years for organized reunions. in this
way, once the custom is traditional-
ized, every year will be some class’s
ﬁrst, third, ﬁfth, seventh or tenth
year. And after years, 1923 may
ﬁnd a multitude of other classes cele-
brating reunions after her fashion.

eaten an apple in the dark I’d never
have known how delightful a worm
tasted!

Places on the boaril are the re-
wards of merit. Each year, the
Quarterly Board announces the con-
ditions on which the competitive try-
outs depend. and elections to the
board are based upon the quantity
and the quality of the manuscripts
submitted.

0n Moving-up Day the Quarterly
Board awards a prize of ﬁfteen dol—
