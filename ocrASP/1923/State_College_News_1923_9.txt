represented the excitable. oﬂlcious
owner of the laundry. Margery Bay-
less, ’24, with her fanciful and idyllic
imagination played most touchineg on
the feelings of the audience and in
her portrayal of Amanda revealed a
good deal of subtle talent.

Edward Vines, ’24, enjoying the
distinction of being the only man in
the plays, interpreted his part of
Mister ’Orace, the “pretend-hero” of
little Amanda, easily and well.

“Miss Tassey” presented a problem
that was perhaps bordering upon the
intangible and elusive, yet is was ex-
ceedineg well executed by members
of th cast. Aileen Wallace. ’24. did
some very ingenious work as the
practical good-natured roommate with
her comforting, gum-chewing ways.
She interpreted to the Nth degree the
calm, dilatory, matter of fact individ-
ual that was needed to mother and
soothe the gay, hysterical Rose, a part
skillfully played by Gladys Hayner,
’23. Winifred Dunn, ’23, served as a
most efﬁcient maid and Helen Borsick,
’24, well portrayed her role. Kathryn
Shipman, ’23. played Miss Tassey, a
part which required patience and
steady nerves.

The “ Maker of Dreams" was the
crowning success of the evening’s
entertainment. How fairy-like was
its delicacy, how artistic its effect,
how irresistable its appeal! Ami then
the solilquy of Pierrictte and the
meditative reﬂections of the Maker
were charmingly woven the dreamy
strains of the harp ' ‘

DURING WINTER
The G. A. A. activities are of
many diil'erent kinds,—-especially dur-
ing this season. First in importance
comes basketball. Six games have
been played, and each game has been
interesting and exciting. The last
game played was between the seniors
and sophomores on January 10th. It
was a last and hard fought contest,
the score being tied several times dur-
ing the game. The ﬁnal score was
81 to 24 in favor of the sophomores.
So far the junior team has the
best chance of winning the champion-
ship. It has won three games and lost
none, the sophomores have won two
games from three, and the seniors one
from three.
ball schedule is as follows;
Jan. 17 -—Junior-Senior
Feb. 7 — Frosh-Soph

Feb. 13 ~-— Soph-Junior
Feb. 21 -— Frosh~Senior
Feb. 28 — Soph-Senior

Mar. 6 — Frosh-Junior

Winter sports are now coming to
the front. Washim--'on Park’s lake is
frozen over and edema great oppor-
tunities for skating while the knolls
which lead down to the lake are ﬁne
for skiing and toboggan riding. If
the weather continues to bring so
much snow, snowshoes will be as nec-
essary an article of apparel as
galoshes. All sports comes under the
point system. This year it takes 100
points for letters and numerals and
'75 for letters only.

which accentuated the enchantment
of the whole. Katherine Driscoil, ’23,
was most delightful and captivating
in her interpretation of Pierrette.
Especially well did she achieve that
light, subtle touch so commendable in
the dramatic act. Pierrot played by
Elizabeth Nagle, ’24, immediately
won the audience with his song and
pretty repartee, and altho he was ﬁck-
le and capricious at ﬁrst, he ﬁnally
recognizer! the fascination of Pier-
rette and became her lover thru the
inﬂuence of the Maker. Edna Shafer,
’24, effectively represented the wise
old Maker of Dreams and made a
striking appeal to the audience.
Great credit for the success of the

 

plays is due to Miss Agnes Futterer
who had full charge of the directing
and coaching.

The setting and costumes were very
effective, and became even more so
when it was known that the girls in
the class had designed and made prac-
tically everything. From the number
of people attending the plays and the
efficiency with which there were made
comfortable in the auditorium, it is
an easy step to this deduction that
both publicity and house committee
had worked hard. To the stage mana-
ger credit is due for the brevity of
the intermission.
