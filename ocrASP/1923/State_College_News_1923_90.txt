THE PEDAGOGUE‘.

The first year book which appeared
at the State College was The Neon,
publlshed in 1900 by the Class oi‘
1900 of the State Normal College.
The Neon is then, the great-great-
gruiult'ather ol.‘ our present day
l’edu rogue, which is published each
year iy the Senior Class at State.

The Neon has a number of fou-
tures which might liito‘rest us now—
desplte the I'act that the hook is older
than we are. The faculty, lncluding
Dr. Milne, President of the Normal
College, consisted ol‘ but twenty—one
members Olf those, only twu remain
with list—Miss Anna l“. Pierce and
Dr. ltlchiirdsen. The members 01' the
Senior Class were given individual
pictures, but were spared the "rum."
\vriteups that home become the
fashion in our later your books. The
Neon was more exclusively a senior
book than our tlll'lllul now is. 'l‘he
class history, the class essay, and the
(1 lss poem were included. A special
feature was the inclusion of the
music of a "Normal College ’I'wo-
Step” composed and arranged by two
Iiieinliers ol' the faculty. The book
was predominately lite " ‘y in flavor,
and numerous stories, 'ays, poems,
and news articles were included.

Among the clubs which contributed
write-ups were the S. . C. Cocoa
Club, the 'l‘cnnis Club, the Camera
Club, the Cycle Club—Hone or two of
which had constitutions which are
well worth reading.

The next year book of which there
is any record is Our Book which was

GRINS

A man carrying a large bag
boarded a bus at the foot of London
Bridge. He argued with the con-
ductor as to.whethor the fare was a
penny or three liall'«pence, Getting
exasperated; the conductor ordered
him off the bus and_ as he would not
go, seized the bag and threw it into
the river. “Stop do bus," cried the
passenger excitedly, “you’ve drowned
my little son.”
