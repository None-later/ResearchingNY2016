THE COLLEGE ORCHESTRA

When your eye rests on this col-
umn, let it see for you a group of
boy! and girls seated! in‘ Room B
on any and every Tuesday night from
7:1.5-8:4ii enjoying the privilege of
musical instruction under the capable
leadership of Mr. ’l'. Frederick [unid—

.lyo. Although college credit is given

for the work done, many take the
orchestral work and the pleasure of
association with fellow students in<
terested in the same work and with
one so eilicient to instruct us. 'i'wo
of our seniors, Dorothy lhmgremond,
’23, and S. Grace Aronowitz, '23,
will vouch for this, for they have
played in the orchestra for four
years, receiving college credit only
one year.

Individual work is enceuragml.
Florence i‘l. Dorsey, '23, and Eleanor
(iill‘en ’24, wrote us part of their
work in Music III, a “tinvotte” and
a “March ltusse” respectively. Iioth
numbers were favorably received at
the spring concert given by the Music
Dmiartnu-nt. The public has had an
ommrtunity of hearing the orchestra
at:

. Mid-winter concert in Chancel»
lors lluil.

. Spring concert in Auditorium.

. "Dramatic Plays" in Albany
High School and on a second
occasion in the Vincentian
Institute.

. Spanish Carnival.

Auditorium.

. A portion of the orchestra will
play at Dr. Brulmcher‘s recep-
tion on June iii.

The ofiicers of the Orchestra are:
President, S. Grace Aronowitz, ’23;
liihrarians, Adeline Solius, ‘26, Id.
Wallace, '26; Manager, Steven Mer-
ritt, " 5.

The orchestra has twenty-live
pieces, among which are violins, sax-
ophoues, pianu, banjos, liute. cornet,
drum, and cello. All those who are
planning to come to State Ioilege in
the fall should he sure to bring their
instruments with them and sign up
for Music IV when they register.
Don’t fail to join the orchestra. Bo—
sides instruction, at good time is
promised to all.

What Is a Vacuum Furnace?

N an ordinary furnace materials burn or combine with the oxygen
of the air. Melt zinc. cadmium, or lead in an ordinary furnace and a
scum of “dross” appears, an impurity formed by the oxygen. You sce
it in the lead pots that plumbers use.

in a vacuum furnace, on the contrary, the air is pumped out so that
the heated object cannot combine with oxygen. Therefore in the
vacuum furnace impurities are not formed.

Clear-i y, the chemical processes that take place in the two types are

different. and the difference is important.

Copper. for instance. if

impure. loses in electrical conductivity. Vacuum-furnace copper is

pure.

So the vacuum furnace has opened up a whole new World of chem-

ical investigation.

The Research Laboratories of the General Electric

Company have been exploring this new world solely to ﬁnd out the
possibilities under a new series of conditions.

Yet there have followed practical results highly important to
industry. The absence of oxidation. for instance, has enabled chemists
to combine metals to form new alloys heretofore impossible. indeed,
the vacuum furnace has stimulated the study of metallurgical proc‘
csscs and has become indispensable to chemists responsible for
production of metals in quantities.

And this is the result of scientific research.

Discover new facts, add to the sum total of human knowledge, and
sooner or later, in many unexpected ways practical results will follow.
