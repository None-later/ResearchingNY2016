BIOLOGY DEPARTMENT
(Continued from page 1'!)
[given this year, owing to the almost
superhuman task of ﬁnding a place
for it in the schedule. This, we feel,
has been a decided defect, for if
there is one thing needed above all
others by the teacher of biology it
is a ﬁrst hand knowledge of his ma-
terials, not in the desiccated, pickled,
uml sectioned state, but healthily
alive in their natural environments.
This «Illliclency has been partly rem-
edied by a series of voluntary field
trips, conducted by members of the
department Of these we hope to
have more next year. Plans are also
being made (“Hope springs eternal”)
for two field courses, one in Identiﬁ-
cation of Trees aan Shrubs, given in
the fall and early winter, and one in
Practical Biology, coming: the second
semester, and including the study of

animals as well as plants.

The Senior Book. liilz, contains
little except the individual portraits
of the graduating class.

The ﬁrst Padanoguo was published
by the class of 1913. With this book
the general make~up of all the Peda-

definitely established. Every year,
