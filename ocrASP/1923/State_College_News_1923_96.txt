these sports. It is under his direc-
tion that State will endcavor to take
its place on the field of collegiate
sports. State’s prospects for the
coming; "eaan seem to be even better.

at the game.

 

New Conch Passimist.

Conch Wee-nor says that he nrel'ers .
to be pessimistic in regard to State’s;
chances of victory. He believes thatl
it is better to be surprised by unex-l
pected victory than disappointed byJ
unexpected defeat. While he recast-l
nizes State’s material, he also acknow‘ ’
ledges the fact that its team will have l
to cone with teams of much larger
colleges where a better opportunity.

Mr. Wee'ner’s aim is to put on the,l
field teams that will play clean names. 3

e looks for every man to field to
the finish. but he also expects every;
player on State’s teams to take defeat l
in a sportsman like manner. ‘

Asks for Loyal Support. I

Most of all he wants the support‘

field will do their share. but without!
the support of the rest of the college:
it will seem like slow work at the
best. e do not want our men tol
play individual games; we want them 
to play for State. Let’s show our.
college spirit by coming out to the;
games and giving our support. I

JOSEPH HENRY
1797-1878

Born at Albany, N.Y., where
he became teacher of mathe-
matics and physics in Albany
Academy. Leading American
physicist of his time. First
director of the Smithsonian
Institution.

The Work that was begun
by pioneers like Joseph
Henry is being carried on
by the scientists in the Re-
search Laboratories of the
General Electric Company.
Theyare constantlysearch-
ing for fundamental prin-
ciples in order that electric-
ily mo be of greater
service to mankind.

When Henry
rang the bell

If any bell was ever heard around the
world, Joseph Henry rang it in his
famous experiment at the Albany
Academy. The amazing development
of the electrical industry traces back
to this schoolmaster’s coil of insulated
wire and his electro-magnet that lifted

a ton of iron.

Four years later when Morse used
Henry’s electro-magnet to invent the
telegraph, Henry congratulated him
warmly and unselﬁshly.

The principle of Henry’s coil of wire is
utilized by the General Electric Com-
pany in motors and generators that
light cities, drive railroad trains, do
away with household drudgery and
perform the work of millions of men.
