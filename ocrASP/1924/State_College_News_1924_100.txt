GET. INTO THINGS

"All the world's a stage, but most
people sit in the gallery and throw things
at the performers," Take the advice of
upper classmen, class of ’28. on't be
criticizers or mere spectators but be
energetic actors. Get into things at
State, and make the college realize you
are you, not as a class but as individuals.
If you are athletically inclined, watch
the G, A. A. bulletin board and Sign up
for events scheduled there. The News
and the Quarterly iiivitc contributions
from you who are interested in literary
pursuits. For you who have musical
talent, there is the college orchestra and
the chorus. Find your place and fill it
to the very best of your ability. In so
doing you will become better acquainted
with other students and with your pro-
fessors; you will take greater interest in
your college, and you will become a per-
sonality here, rather than one of three
hundred and forty-seven freshmen!

FORMER EDITOR MISSES S. C. T.

A bit of news from the class of ’Z-l
comes to us in a letter received by Miss
Tallmadgc from Dorothy Ileiniit, former
editor-in-chief of the News. She savs:

" ‘0 describe my present haunts and
customs midst the peaceful tribe of red-
skins—Mohawk is a great'plare. The
school is all that anyone could desire in
the form of light, heat, good looks, and
students. My discipline will grow rusty
from want of use. In theafternoons I
supervise the grades in drawing. I seem
to have struck a responsive chord in the
hearts of the very young, because when
