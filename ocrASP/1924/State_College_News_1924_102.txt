TELEPHONE DIRECTORY
WITH STUDENT NAMES
WILL BE ISSUED SOON

'l‘IIe oilieial student telephone diree~
tnry, the first in the college‘s history, will
be issued within tivo months, liieiuioi'
Gallery, chairman of the committee, said
yesterday. ’l‘alniiation of the cards col-
lected in assembly last liriday has been
going on this week, she said. The di-
rectory will be issued in convenient
pamphlet size and will be sold to stu-
dents at a nominal rate to cover the eost
of preparation.

The new directories will fill a long-
felt need. the committee believes. Stu-
dents have been unable to communicate
with many of their friends by phone dur-
itig the evening. because the instruments
at their residences are listeil under other
names. During the day students can be
located at the college, but in the evening
this is not possible.

The committee appointed from the
student association is: Eleanor (‘allery.
chairman; Elizabeth Johnson, ilarriet
liaiter, Abbie Crawford, anti Genevieve
Keaveney.

WILL ROGERS
GREAT HISTORIAN

day, but did you ever view him as a

rent events? Professor lx’isley main-
tains that “ Will Rogers has one of the
greatest minds in the country.“ We
versed in the news of the present day
"Will " spouts it to the public from the
stage in a most popular ainl fascinating
manner.

“ Mr. lingers." said Professor ltisicy,
“is the most sought after man in New
York as an after dinner speaker and as
a guest in private homes." Surely. the
Prince of Wales showed his gooii taste
when he expressed his liking for Will
Rogers.
