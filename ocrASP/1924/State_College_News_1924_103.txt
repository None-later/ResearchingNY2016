Football En Go To
Worcester Today

State College will open its 1924 foot-
ball season tomorrow afternoon
against the strong Worcester Tech
team at Worcester, Mass. The team
will leave Albany this afternoon.

During the past weeks, great strides
havu been made by the fooball suuad.
Hard luck. though, came during this
period of strenuous play. Hornung
was laid up with a severe case of ten-

 

, silitis, and will be unable to attend

practice for at least three weeks.
Campbell, whose knee was injured dur-
ing last year's football 5 is ‘ '
the same knee during the first scrim-
mage this season, tlms preventing his
playing ally more this year. Another
reverse in fortune came when l.'erry,
a reliable scrub, had his nose broken,
and his eye badly damaged.

orcester 'l‘ech will undoubtedly
present stiff opposition to our men, in
fact this game should come later in
the season. However, the lighting
spirit is runningr high and strong in
the squad. with way man trying hard
to get in condition in order to give the
lVorcester team a real battle. After
one or two games the men will prob-
ably be in much better form. It will
require a few games in order to get
going and to smooth out some of the
rough spots. The line up against
Worcester 'l'ecb will probably be as
follows:

Graham, left end: Gainor, left tackle;
Haynes, left guard; Roberts, center;
Jensen, right guard; Crawford, right
tackle; Donncly, right end; Crane,
quarter back; Sage, right half back;
Johnson, left half back; Kuczynski,
full back.

Cantwell, Clarke, Nephew, Juckett.
Dobris, and Kershaw will no doubt
have an opportunity to enter the game
before the ﬁnish.

Student Tax Less,
Record Budget Levy
To Be Begun Soon

State College's record student bud-
get of $lf),9lfl, adopted almost un-
animously last Friday, will soon be
collected by the linance board which,
under the leadership of Professor C.
A. l‘lidley, faculty treasurer, prepared
it. The tax will be eleven dollars, one
dollar less than last year.

The budget calls for increased allot-
ments for the iulirnlary fund from
$l,li00 to $2,000, for the News from
$1,850 to $l,950 and a smaller incr
for the freshmen "bible." its total is
$10,9l0 contrasted with $l0,SSS last
year.

The increase in inllrmary fund is in
line. with the policy of keeping two
dollars in the fund for every student
in college. Increased registration also
explains the increase for the “bible.”
The College News will expend the
additional $100 in raising the general
standard of the paper and more effi-
cient equipment for the News office.
The budget was adopted as a whole
with little opposition.

Collection of the budget will be be-
gun next week and the board will
make a determined effort to have
everyone in college paid up before
'l'hanksgiviug vacation. This
books will be issued, each with . Kty
tickets, instead of the usual cards.
The tickets are numbered and one will
be detached for each event attended.

“The Finance lloard is well satis-
fied with the success of this year's
budget," Mr. l‘lidley said, when in-
formed on his return from Niagara
Falls it had been adopted as whole.
“ We have been able to cut a dollar
from the tax, making it eleven this
year," he added. “The budget's total
is only slightly larger. If we are to
operate this year in a businesslike way
and with least confusion and delay,

 

 

we must levy the budget immediately. ' L

We will seek student co-operation in
gettlng subscriptions "I quickly.”

DEMOCRATS
WILL FIGHT
FQBMYOTES
Political Campaign
Stronger Daily

Democratic students will make the
new Students’ Republican Club light
for every vote, it was announced this
week by leaders who are rushing ar-
rangements fora counter campaign to
block the work of the Coolidge sup-
porters.

The political situation here, brought
suddenly and startiugly into light last
Friday when chapel was thrown into
turmoils over the Democratic endorse-
ment resolutions, this week developed
rapidly. Yesterday it gave every
promise of a campaign that will en-
gross student interest until election.

An emphatic statement was issued
by Jerome ll. Walker, '25, that the
overwhelmilu,r majority by which his
resolution was defeated is a false in-
dication of Democratic strength here.

“ Four hundred students, at least,"
Mr. Walker declared, "are backers of
Al Smith and stand by Davis, The
vote last Friday proved nothing. It
is ridiculous to claim only seven stu-
dents herc are Democrats.

“An Al Smith club will bring forth
our true strength and will give the
Coolidge men a run for their money."

Walker said he belives Republican
sentiment docs outweigh Democratic
here, but not 750 to 7. A majority of
students come from Republican
strongholds, he pointed out.

Edmund H. Crane, leading backer
of the Republican club, admitted the
vote is not final.

” Coolidge is far ahead here," be de-
clared, “ but not that far. We are not
underestimating our opponents’
strength.”

No official count was made in chapel
of the vote, but according to observers
only seven voted to endorse Smith and
Davis. Mr. Walker began this week
to put into operation his intention then
announced of Democratic organiza-
tion. He conferred sereral times with
city and county Democratic leaders
who are reported amazed by the vote
Friday. Other Democratic workers
assisted in organization work.

“Active support from the Demo-
cratic committee is practically as-
sured,” Mr, \\7alkcr said.

Tuesday night Republican students
met for preliminary organization.
Frank A. McNamee, In, President of
the Albany Cm ill(igC‘I-)il\\'C$ club
spoke. The advisory committee will
be elected instead of appointed, Mr.
Crane has announced. Campaign lit-
e‘alure has been received from Wash-
i , ton. Any student of any party who
will b‘ away from home Election day
and wants to vote can receive instruc-
tions from the Republican leaders, be
salt .

Mr. \Valker is trying to secure as a
chapel speaker State Senator \Villiam
'l‘. liyrue, of Albany, noted campaign
orator, and one of the sponsors in the
legislature of the $800,000 appropria-
tion for the new college wings. Per-
mission to have Senator Byrne speak
can be secured, he thinks.
