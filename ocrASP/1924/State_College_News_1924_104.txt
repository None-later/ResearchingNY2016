FOOTBALL SEASON OPENS

Tomorrow a purple and goltl'squad
will take the field against Worcester.
With the opening of the football sea-
son an added responsibility rests upon
State College students. It is our busi-
ness to make this season a successful
season. As a student body we must
stand behind the team and give them
that applause which spurs a losing
side to victory.

Playing on a foreign gridiron, play-
ing perhaps against odds, playing with
crowded bleachers cheering for the
opposing team. presents an alarmingr
state of affairs. See that those
bleachers of ,\Vnrccster's campus are
crowded with motors for State, you
who are able to attend the game Sat—
urday. Your part is small in comparh
son with those men who are ﬁghting
for the honor of State. Be there and
hold down a bleachcr while our team
holds down \Vnrcestcr. Know your
cheers, know your songs, and know
how to yell!

Coach Baker has been drilling the
team with every effort since early in
the season. His ability as a coach is
a matter of common knowledge. The
men have been diligently training
and sacriﬁcing much for the team's
success. With a good coach, a goat
team, and a strong backing a hard
ﬁght must ensue. Worcester, State
is ready for youl

ALLEGIANCE

College allegiance can not be ob-
tained with the registration slip upon
entrance to college. Allegiance to any
particular thing entails the individual
himself—his interest, his admiration.
Do you feel that you are an outsider
in the events going on about you?
Are you putting your whole self into
college? If you are, then college Will
be of inestimable value to you;.if
you're not—then don’t blame the m-
stitutionl

their special domain. The ball is being
redecorated, and six or seven electric
light plugs are being installed there. In
the kitchens a new pressure boiler,
steamer, am! a number of the smaller
laboratory utensils together with the
Lorraine ovens purchased last fall com-
bine to offer a decided incentive to indus-
try in the Home Economics department.
