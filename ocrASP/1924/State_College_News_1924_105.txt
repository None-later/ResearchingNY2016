were paddled at intervals by relays of
sophomores. Many who enjoyed the
rug rolling were allowed to stand out
one corner of the rug, while it was
pulled suddenly from beneath them.
Sophomores stood ready to save heads
from serious bruises Men and women
with their necks shackled in the backs
of chairs raced on their knees on the
gymnasium lloor. ingenious stunts
for individuals were provided in inter-
vals to keep the freshmen occupied.

l-d them in the singing of their special
fr slimeu song. inspired by her di-
rections to her classmates to "watch
the freshmen and take the names of
those who don't know the words," all
freshmen produced noise of great
volume.

Although nearly everyone supposcdi
it nearly midnight, the initiation w
over at ’):l5 and the freshmen were.
invited to lind their shoes, wash up
and return for a party as the I‘l\'
itass's guests. Dancing, with music
by sophomores, continued until ll
o'clock.

Dean Pierre, Dr. Croasdale, and sev-
ural other members of the faculty
were present. Members of Myskania
supervised the program.

THREE SPECIAL DEGREES

Substitution of three specialized bache—
lor’s degrees in science, those in home
economics, commerce, and education for
the straight science degree was one of
the more important changes inaugurated
this year by the administration. The
move is in line with the present day
trend in the more progressive colleges in
the east, according to faculty members.
