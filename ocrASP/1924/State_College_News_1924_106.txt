HEAD NAMED

G.A.A. Elects Captain

 

 

Mary Hutchins, '25, will be captain
of girls varsity basketball this year
and Jeanetta Wright, ’26, will be
manager. Both were elected by the
team last Friday. Season practice has
begun. Miss Hutchins was elected
unanimously. Elizabeth Milmine op-
posed Miss Wright.

Tomorrow, the date of the Indian
Ladder hike, is G. A. A.'s red letter
day, for at this big annual event the
entire college plays. It is the most
popular way to secure vim, vigor, and
vitality, and G. A. A. points, that has
yet been discovered.

The buses will leave college at ten
and twelve o'clock on Saturday morn-
ing, thus Saturday classes will prove no
barrier to (i. A. A. enthusiasts. Dr.
Croasdale, Miss Morris, and Miss John—
ston will act as chaperons, and those
who have attended previous hikes will
know their facility for keeping the fun
at a high pitch. One dollar will cover
all costs, including lunch. Those leaving
on the ten o’clock are requested to brim.
their own noon-day lunch.

Come on, everybody—to Indian Lad-
der for fun, fame, and excitement on
October 11.

G. A. A. is meeting the demand for
” something new " by putting it up to
the sophomores to entertain the members,
freshmen especially, in next month’s
frolic. Of course if the class of 1928
so desires their time may come, too.

CANTERBURY BACON BAT

Nineteen members of the Canterbury
Club enjoyed the joys of :1 bacon bat.
last Saturday, near the Country Club.
After a hike, they proceeded to gorge
on bread, and bacon and eggs. After
a time the loss of bread was felt, but
no one came away hungry. Their pie-
tures taken by a reporter of the “ Albany
Evening News," stories told, and songs
sting around a camp-fire, the happy
Canterbury Club cantered home in time
for the G. A. A. frolic.
Accompanied by Rev. and Mrs. Findlay.
they arrived at their destination about
five o’clock, and with everyone's help,
a cheery fire was soon burning and an
appetizing meal prepared. The remain-
ing time was spent around the camp
ﬁre in telling,r stories, singing, and dis-
cussing activities for the coming year.

[Excitement aplenty, surprises, songs,
and games were provided under the aus-
pices of Dorothy ’i‘aylor's fine commit—

tee. The roast was well attended by
about ninety persons, including club
members, faculty, and freshmen. The

unusual attendance is due to the effective
work done by Grace Root and her invi-
tation-transportation, committee.
