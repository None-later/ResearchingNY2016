To Give Concert
The first concert of the s -ason, under
the auspices of the State College Music
Association, will take place on Friday
evening, December 12, in Chancellor's
Hall, when students will have the privi-
leee of hearing one of the finest pianists
in the world—.Ossip Gabrilowitsch.
tiahrilowitsch is not only a great: pianist
hut an equally great orchestral conductor.
le is at present the conductor of the
Detroit Orchestra, hut still ﬁnds time to
give a few recitals every year. The
bringing,r of a pianist represents a new
departure on the part of the Music Asso-
ciation. It is thought, however, that as
so many students play the piano, a re)
cital on this instrument will appeal to
a large number in the college. Admis-
sion is free on presentation of Student
tax ticket. "ittkets will he sold to the
puhlic for $2.00, and $1.50, and rescr~
vations for them may now be made on
application to Mr. Candlyn.
