first home game of the season. Colgate
on the kick-off reached State's twenty
’llt'tl litie where Ross after a series of
litte plunges kicked the goal. 'l‘hrough
a fumble by State the ball was carried
to State's ten yard line. Attempts were
futile in endeavoring to break the
yearlings' onruslt. It was their score.
The visitors crossed the home goal line
three times in the first quarter and sitc-
ceedcd in kicking two goals. Linc
plunges and end runs marked Colgate's
attempt at scoring. In the second unar-
ter State rallied; it had a 210 pound liite
to stop or break. Colgate did not score.
yet it was only the liner and cleaner
playing of State that prevented it worse
defeat. The third quarter was char—
acterized by a continual threatening of
t‘olgate's line. The last period opened
with added determination. This time.
