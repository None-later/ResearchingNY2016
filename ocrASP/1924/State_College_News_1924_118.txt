Civic Problems

Professor Hidley maintains that His-
tory has to do with the vital problems of
the (lay, and that time [or them should be
given in the class room. “Absentee vot—
ing," "split ticket," and "blocs" have
been words whose meanings have come
home to citizens in the events of the
last few months.

HOME SERVICE WEEK

This week is Home Service Appeal
Week. Last Friday the students of State
College heard two speakers, the Rev. J.
Martin Simonson and Mr. Watkins, of
the Salvation Army.

Mr. Simonson is brigadier of the
Army in Albany. In his speech' he re-
marked that the Salvation Army has
)een organized only ﬁfty—nine years, ant
to-day is known in eighteen countries.
Its latest work is the establishment of
a playground on Broad street. Albany.
Mr. Simonson said the morale of the
children who played there has risen Slit“
prisingly.

Mr. Watkins gave more examples to
prove the helpfulness of the work in
)any.

“The motto of the Salvation Army,"
Iic said, "is, 'A man may be down, hilt
he is never ont.’ Our slogan is soup,
so' i, and salvation. The operating ex-
penses of the Army are small," Iie said.
Adding your dollar will make sad Iicarts
t iappy.”

This week Dr. Ilrnhachcr arranged for
the participation of every student.
