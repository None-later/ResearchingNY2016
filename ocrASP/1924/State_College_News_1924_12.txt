failed to pass the enabling

a propriation for the com—

petion of the building.
Plans drawn up by State

Architect Sullivan W. Jones. .

under the advisory assistance
of Dr. Brubacher. call for a

building which would rival in .

architectural beauty any
structure of its kind in Al—
bony.
local designers, the state al-
chitect has made provision
for a cupola on the main
part of the new building.
With this one exception
ol’ the Georgian tower in the
center of the group, the
structures will conform to
the present college buildings.

The wing: toward the Al-
bany High school will be de-
voted to laboratories of the
biology and home economics
departments. and the other
wing: will be utilized for
high school and the
psychology laboratories. in
the center will he a gym-
nasium ol‘ huge proportions,
constructml on a modern
scale with complete appara-

lmbibing the trend or -

 

tus and space for indoor
games. The assembly hall.

will be over the gymna-
sium. it will seat I,200 stu—
dents. or 500 more than the
present auditorium.

s soon as the new build-
ing is available. it is planned
to convert the present audi~
torium into a library, with

‘ facilities for more than 10,«

000 volumes. Study space
will be provided for more
than 200 students at a time,
thus making a notable im»
provement in the now inade-
quate library room. The
present Iib'ary will be con-
verted into a lure-e class
room.

The proposed addition
would face on Western ave-
nue. setting back some 200
feet from the sidewalk. it
would have a rear entrance
on Washington avenue. In
the front and side of the
building will be a baseball
diamond and athletic ﬁeld.
_ ttempts are now being
made by Dr. Brubacher to
have the city of Albany de<
Signate the section of West~
ern avenue in which is lo-
cated State College as "State
College Plaza." He urges
students to constantly refer
to it as such, instead of the
“campus.”

Should the appropriation
for the practically million-
dollar addition he passed this
spring. it is in all probability
that the foundation will be
well under way by Septem-
her and members of the pres-
ent. freshman class may do
their practice teaching in the
new Milne High school.

It is necessary that stu-
dents ‘get after their repre-
sentatives in the Legislature
and urge them to vote for
the appropriation without
reservation. “Boost State
College” should be the slogan
of everyone.

While each advocate of
the change in the present or-
der of things admits that at-
tendance at chapel helps cre-
ate college spirit, he contends
that, under present condi-
tions. it is zlsking‘ too much
of a senior. if not also of a
junior, to be present every
Friday morning and either
take a seat upon the plat,-
l‘orm or stand up in the rear
aisles.

According to Miss Dutch-
eI'. president ol“ the student
association. it would be ideal
il,‘ voluntary attendance at
Chapel were allowed. But.
she cautiously adds, idealism
cannot exist at State College.

“There are always too
many ‘other engagements‘
when it comes time for as-
sembly under the voluntary
system,” says l‘resident
Dutcher. “’l‘his is shown in
c llegi-s where the reform
system ()lll'l‘LlLU-‘l, and it
would certainly be the sann.
here.

“However. i think it
would he line. from certain
aspects. to abolish the pres»
ent compulsory attendance
system. Seniors are sup-
posed to have imbibed sulli-
ciem. class spirit and college
spirit in their three years
that it should be left to their
option In attend chapel.”

Among others who were
asked to‘ comment on the
chapel system. there seemed

changes. one of which would
be the setting aside of a spe.

business meeting when stu-
dents would he free to (lis—
cuss student problems in an
open forum.

Miss Daley, president 01'
the Junior class. practically
reiterated Miss Dutcher's
opinions. and President Com—
stock of the Freshman class
came out strongly for exemp-
tion of upper-classmen from
compulsory attendance. i‘re«
sident Campbell of the Soph-
omore class said he believed
the present system O.K., but
thought changes could be
made in the programs to
make chapel not only more
interesting, but to better de—
velop college spirit.
