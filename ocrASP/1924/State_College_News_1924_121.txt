HONOR. AT H'I‘A'I.‘I‘i
o wonder State College votes down
an honor system. The students can't
trust themselves, to say nothing of trust-
ing one another." This remark was
made by a non-attendant of State ('nl-
lege last year when the college. as a body,
voted down the honor system. As '
(lent body we declare that this \
the reason for such an action. We voted
down the honor system be‘ausc we did
not feel quite prepared to assume the re~

 

  

spousbilily of such a system. and not be .
cause of lack of trust lIl one another. 1
The question involved is not a question of ;

 

honesty. it is a rpn-stion of the ellcctivc

STUDENT COMMENT

Certainly, the speevh given by (iet‘ll'lnle

lsors concerning respect for our .\hna
.‘ Ma went straight to every freslnnan's
ihcart. They. perhaps. had not realized
how their action appeared. when they
had failed to wear their buttons or caps.
’very freshman has learned to love and
respect State College now. livery slns

‘line with other gre't colleges. What
freshman, moreover, ashamed tn
one. and therefore fails to wear his or
ier badge? livery cl: s needs a feeling
of unity and importance—a feeling called
'class spirit. The freshmen should begin

to acquire at least a little.
