Emerson tells how the mass of
men worry themselves into
nameless graves. while now
and then a great, unselﬁsh soul
forgets himself into immor-
tality. One of the most inspir-
ing inﬂuences in the life of a
modern corporation is the
selﬂess work of the scientists
in the laboratories, which it
provides tor their research.

Thomas .4. Edison and Charles P. Steinmetz in the Schenectady
laboratories of the General Electric Company, where Dr. Steinmetz
did his great work

Steinmetz

The spirit of Dr. Steinmetz kept his
frail body alive. It clothed him with
surpassing power; he tamed thelight-
ning and discharged the ﬁrst artiﬁcial
thunderbolt.

Great honors came to him, yet he
will be remembered not for what he
received, but for what he gave.
Humanity will share forever in the
proﬁt of his research. This is the
reward of the scientist, this is endur-
ing glory.
