ART DEPARTMENT
TO SELL PICTURES

The Dramatic and Art Association
has a surprise in store. in about a week,
the walls of the tnain hail will be hidden
under some of the ﬁttest etchings in the
country. A.» the American Federation of
Art is putting them forth, these etchings
promise to be of great interest and
value. Matty American artists will be
represented. Miss Olga Hampel hap-
pened to meet and converse with several
of these celebrities when she went: to
\\"ashingtoii last year as representative
of the Dramatics and Art Association
at State College.

These works of art will be. on sale at
reasonable prices. However, the vital
function of the exhibition is to inspire
a keen appreciation of the fascinating
style o the possibilities for varied
treatment of subject displayed in these
etchings.

Miss Perine will have a reproduction
of the etchings in Room 208. The ar-
t' s name is Mnudcn.
