STATE COLLEGE NEWS,_ NOVEMBER 14, 1924.

 

 

Risley Interviews
Monsieur Lausaune

Professor Risley spoke of a remark-
able: coincidence which he had had on
November ll, 1918. Professor Rislcy
was on the entertainment committee of
the University Club, which had procured
Monsieur Stephan Lausaune, then head
of the Committee on lnformation, as a
speaker. The date set was November
11. Monsieur Lausaune, editor of one
of the most inﬂuential I’rench news—
papers. the “Paris Matin." arrived at
the club; garbed in his beautiful, blue
uniform. Ite seemcd’to typify the French
victory, as he stood up to speak. A
murmur hegan to be heard around the

room until it finally burst into a roar—«v

every man was on his feet yelling at
the top of his voice. It was a spec-
tacular performance! it was November

.

Professor Risley had the opportunity
to have two interviews with Monsieur
Lausatme while he was in Paris.

Last November 11, while in Paris.
Professor Risley watched the colonial
troops march, through the Arc de
'l'riomphe. :er light the liternal Fire at
the grave of the Unknown Soldier. The
French Ambas dor. embodying in his
dignity American feeling placed a
wreath upon the grave. The most spec-
tacular part was the shrill, nervous. pe-
culiar music of the Ilntes of the
Moroccan troops.

   

NEWS URGES CO-OPERATION

it is only through the cooperation
of an entire student body that a col-
lege paper can be representative of the
ideas and aims of that body. What the
paper really is depends almost as
much on the students themselves, as on
the board running the paper. Here at
State, the college paper is run by a
board of editors. reporters and cubs.
Each week assignments are given to
the reporters and cubs. if they are
alive and wide awake, without doubt.
they will bring back something in
shape of news, but often even the best
of them fail. Often they have done
their part, and then where does the
fault tie? it most often lies with the
student or organization to whom they
are sent for news.

The editors are trying to make the
“News” as representative of the stu-
dent bme as possible, and the way in
which the students and organizations
respond to their appeal for cooperation,
will decide, to a large extent, the suc-
cess or failure of the “News” as such
a paper,

The “News” wishes to bake an ap-
peal to all the students and organiza-
tions to give their help in making
State's “News” a big, alive, paper. A
paper of which State can be justly
proud.
