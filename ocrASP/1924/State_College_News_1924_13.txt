Every Knock a Boost

 

To the Editor of the NEWS:

To all appearances the “powers
that he” at State have started the
New Year well. Some much needed
redecorating is being- carried out in
the locker rooms and in the lower
hall for which we are very grateful.

lt reminds one that perhaps sprinp;
is not so far away at'ter all. We are
all quick to criticize and find fault;
now we have a chance to show the
other side of human nature. Let’s
do it!

ll‘ wi- look on the right side we'll
lind that. State’s a pretty good ‘ilace
nl'tvr all. Some day We may earn
that; we make our own good time; m-
have as much of an opportunity to do
it here at State as we will ever have.

If we’ve been knocking things the
past year, now is the chance to start
on :1 dill'erent track. When the train
pulls out for this year, let’s- be sure
that we’re on the i' ht one, tln- one
where every nasuniuer inns a bright
and cheerful outlook on lil’v.

The Cigarette Evil

 

To the Editor of lhe News:

It has recently COIlll' to our notici-
that cigarette cases urn to be given
to the men as l’rom layers. and we
write to express our disapproval of
the ti-nicrity of this action 01' the
l’roni committee.

ill the first place, cigynrt-tte smok-
ing is a habit not to be tolerated in
Illl'll who are destined to he the mluJ
cntnl's ol‘ the future.

in the second place. i'ilt' prom coni-
mittee’s action in chasing such i'arors
is nuthlne' less than nn insult to Dr.
Bruhachm- and Myskunln who have.

THE BROADENING CURRICULUMg

 

Stanford University has just taken
a notable step toward the attainment
of the dream which has always hov-'
ered bel’ore the eyes 01' educators——i
the harmonious and slmultaneous
training: of mind and body. Cheer-'
leading: has been made a part of the!
curriculum at Pnlo Alto. ’l‘hern willi
be classes inl Bleacher Psycholong
Correct Use of the Voice, and Devel-l
opment of Stage Presence. Credit is to i
be elven to sophomores tryinp: out fori
the position of yell-leader. Ultimate-l
ly, perhaps. Stanford will he confer-inf
inn decrees sonoris causa.

Athletics have for some time been
taking their rightful place alone; with
other studies in the colleges. But it
has remained for the California ex-
perimenters to blend the physical and
the academic by a. single operation.

Just a single doubt arises. How is
cheer-lending in the curriculum to be
correlated with Lier Football teaches
courage, self-restraint and team-play.
Membership on the From Committee
and on the editorial boards is a prop-
aration for leadership in the grown-
up world, Even textbooks and lec-
tures may be of some future use. But
for what does a course in cheer-lead-
ing speciﬁcally prepare? For stup-
plng panics in the subway? For
nominntlng Favorite Sons?

ROGER BACON
l2 l4- l294

English philosopher and man
of science. Studied at Oxford
and the University of Paris.
Wrote the Opus Majus, Opus
Minus, Opus Tertillm, and
many other treatises.

More than a million dol-
lars a year is devoted to
research by the General
Electric Company in
order that the giant —
electricity—may be
made more and more
useful to mankind.

 

For this he was
sent to prison

Roger Bacon may not have invented gun-
powder, as has been claimed by some biog-
raphers of the famous Franciscan friar, but
he exploded some of the outstanding errors
of thirteenth century thought, Because of
his advanced teachings, Bacon spent many
years of his life in prison.

In an age of abstract speculation he boldly
asserted the mathematical basis of all the
sciences. But even mathematical calcula-
tion, he showed, must be veriﬁed by ex-
periment, which discovers truths that spec-
ulation could never reach.

In the Research Laboratories of the Gen-
eral Electric Company, Bacon’s principles
are followed in every experimental investi-
gation. The gas-ﬁlled electric lamp and
the electron tube were worked out on
paper, but it was experimental veriﬁcation
of the underlying mathematical theory that
made electric illumination, radio broadcast-
ing and X-rays what they are today.
