Known fi‘dihCoast To
Coast As Dramatist

Miss Draper, who is to appear at
Chancellor's Hall on December 6, at

5, is a granddaughter of Charles
A. Dana, who was Assistant Secretary
of War under Lincoln. and the well
known editor of the New York Sun.
Her father, William H. Draper, who
died in 1900, was a distinguished phy—
sician. aiiil her brother is l"aid Draper,
the concert singer aml vocal teacher.

From her grandfather. site must
have inherited much of the wit and
wisdom with which her sketches
abound, while her dramatic iiciiius
may be traced to the famous journal—
ist's wife who, it is said, was possessed
of line liistriouic ability and had. aspira-
tions for the static.

Many of the newspaper critics of
New York and elsewhere, where Miss
Draper has appe. , iii commenting
upon her exceptional powcrsof inimi-
cry, her astonisliitii.r versatility, and
her inanysidcd talents, have expressed
wonder why she does not identify iter—
self with a regular play. She did make
one attempt at it with Marie ’l'euipest
iii “A Lady's Name,” but to be sub-
servient to the dictates of a Stage
director. did not appeal to her. She
preferred a career whcr. her indepen—
dence would enjoy the fullest scope
and give her imlividtial standing.
Evidently. her achievements have ac-
cotltpllsltcd that purpose.

Ilei' t)\'t:t‘\\'llt}lll|ll|){ succ ss is one. of
the most remarkable ever known itt
amusement annals. ller triumph in
London, followed by a genuine ova-
tion in Paris, was euarded as a dis-
tinction never be ore won by an
American artist. She even went a
step further when she presented her
original character sketches to equally
enthusiastic audiences in Madrid. At
a time \\llt'|l Amer was marvelliug
at the I‘( tptiou hereof two companies
of Rd. .in players, fx'utb Draper, an
American, was carrying American art
to the most; famous capitals of Europe.

From coast to coast, her character-
izations have been given, aiiil whether
in Chicago, Boston or Philadelphia,
she has been cordially greeted by
capacity houses. No longer is she
considered a monologist. She ranks
with the foremost actresses. In New
York City. her Sunday nights at the
Selwyn Theatre became an institution
and her houses are invariably sold out
in advance. Such attendance is
awarded only to artists who have won
and held popularity. Her character
sketches are not merely monologues.
She presents and enactslittle cameos
of characters that one minute hold
the audience tense in pathos. the next
moment laughing at the foibles of
easily recognized society types. Her
characters are perfectly wrought; each
one lives. There is a subtle quality
of ﬁnish about her art or work which
stamps it as the work of an artist who
loves her nrt.’

Miss Draper is at present publishing
a series of her monologues in the

It approaches the completion of four-
lifths of a century of that service, the
state's largest and oldest unit in
teacher training. ’
The completion of eighty years of
expansion marks also ,the beginning
of an era of increased prosperity.
With one-third of the goal' for the
