TEACHING IlN’lllCIll‘lS'l‘lel ,

At a recent address delivered at]
Hunter College, Dr. John Erskine of
Columbia University, made the follow-
ing statement, “People are not teach—
crs to serve the human race-“that is
but the result. Frankly, teaching is
the richest and most in'ing life.
To those of us who have considered
teaching a humanitarian cause. this is
certainly an eye-opener. Evidently we
are not to be sent out to the wilds of.
the Adirondacks or the Catskills to act,
as missionaries. in rescuing savagesl
from ignorance. Instead, we are to}
lind in these remote regions, an inter-i
esting anil exciting work. We are not‘
to become self-sacri[icingr martyrs to a
noble cause, but we are to become or«‘
dinary human beings who delight in
living and working with other huniani
beings. The term “teacher” noi
longer means a be-spectacled, long-i
faced individual who is afraid to smile]
it means an individual who is not;
afraid to live, that is, to live his best,

\Vc teachers, then, are not to be}
placed in a box labeled with “Takel
every day except Saturdays and Sun-‘
days—and be thankful for small favors
like vacations and week-ends." We
are to stand forth, nncategoried and.
unlabeled. We are to be individuals,l
and not a specie-z of microbes. 'l‘eaclhi
inf,r to us is to he a vital vocation, andl
not a side track where we may parkl
until a marriage offer comes along. 4

Keeping in mind Dr. Erskine'sl
statement, then, “let us strive on in,
the work we are ink—not doomed tol
a life sentence, but allowed to enterl
an interesting and helpful profession.

THE IDEAL ROOM

"My rooinl [ love the crctonnc chair,
The thin-legged table where l sew.
The old mirror with its air
('If vanities lived long ago!

The picture of three poplar trees
llcsidc a path I often tread.

‘ And all the inwrought memories

Of happy days long sped."

Certainly everyone wishes for an
ideal room such as is described in
these lines. The problem is: can
Stale College students' rooms be made:
so? Dean icrce, at a recent ineetingi
of the freshmen, asked a series oil
questions in relation to rooiiiing‘.
places and room. Some of the (pies-l
tions were: ls your room attractive;l
what are you doing to make it so;
have you a convenient place for your,
books and papers; do you have to}
share this place with others; have you;
a suitable table or desk; have you suf-'
ficicnt light (both natural and artiIi-l

cial), ipiict conditions, fresh air,
warmth, and a comfortable chair, all
which are necessary for successful

study?

Dean Pierce will make use of the
statistics received from the answers to
these questions to help the students.
and she will have a talk with every‘
freshman whose living conditions seem
to need attention. Dean icrce is
vitally interested in the welfare of the
students, and she will be glad to' help
in these. matters as far as possible. l
