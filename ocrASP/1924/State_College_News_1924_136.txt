Music Recital

The Music Association of State
College will present Ossip Gabrilow-
itsch in recital at Chancellor's Hall
next Friday night, at 8:30 o’clock.
In the past the association has brought
string quartets to Albany, but the

caused a change in the usual program.
Gabrilowitsch, conductor of the De-
troit Symphony Orchestra, is the son-
in-law of Mark Twain, having mar-
ried Clara Clemens, the author's
daughter. The program will be an-
nounced later and is likely to include.
a ninnber of requests made by students
and musicians of Albany, according to
T. Frederick H. Candlyn, who is
arranging for the event.

years, the freshman clothing class is
again making children’s dresses. On
\Vcdncsday, November l9, the chil-
dren were at college for the taking of
measurements. The crackers and
milk which were served had evidently

was heard to remark, "Are we going
to eat after this?”

 

JUNIORS AND SENIORS
VICTORS
The juniors held the seniors to a
score 0 4- in favor of '25, in the
game played all November 24. The
contest was fast, open warfare, re-
markably free from fumbles.
The game of ’25 vs. ‘28. resulted in
a steady uprolling of points for the
seniors, while the unilerclassmen by
(lint of sudden spurts forced the '25
guards to keen work. The linal score
was 23-8 ll] favor of '25.

 

As late one (lay to class I lied,
I met Miss Cobb with several
"Peds."

Some were thick and some were

small
But the l925 “Pcd” beat them all.
