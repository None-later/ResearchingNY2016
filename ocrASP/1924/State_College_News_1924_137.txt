UNION WINS;
LAW SCORES

State Meets Defeat
As Bravely As Ever

State College basketball team in the
ﬁrst game of the season lost by a score
of 33 to 15 to Union College in the
State Armory, Saturday night.

With nearly eight hundred present,
State presented genuine ﬁghting,r spirit
and evidence of hard training. Union,
by its brilliant defense, defeated many
of State‘s attempts at scoring. State,
nevertheless. by forward passes and
long shots, succeeded in making eight
points during the ﬁrst half. The re-
maining few minutes of the last half,
State with renewed effort made the
Unionites pay for near] yevery basket.
As the whistle blew at the conclusion
of the game, State made its ﬁnal
basket, raising its points to a total of
ﬁfteen.

On Monday night, State again lost
to the Brooklyn Law School by a
score of 40 to 23. Again State met
with a defense it could not break. In
the first half State was unable to
handle the faster men from Brooklyn.
Its old spirit was there, but it was not
used to the manoeuvres of its oppo-
nent. in the second half State rallied
once more. Nephew starred. makingr
several throws directly underneath the
basket and otherwise making possible
a better showing for State. Brook-
lyn fouled at the ending of the game
and Nephew threw the ball that raised

and Leschetizky, afterwards making his
professional debut in Berlin. In 1900
he came to the United States, and since
his marriage to Clara Clemens, daughter
of Mark Twain, he has become more
closely identiﬁed with the 'life of
America. In 1918 he accepted the post
of conductor of the Detroit Symphony
Orchestra.

Gabrilowitsch is acknowledged to be
one of the greatest pianists of the time.
He excels in the playing of programs ar-

THIRD GAME "‘
PLAYED HERE

Varsity 'ITo—Meet
St. Michaels’ Team

The Purple and Gold court ﬁve will
play its third game of this season to—
morrow night in the college gym at 8
o‘clock. with St. Michael's College var-
city from Winnoski Park, Vermont.
There will be a preliminary game by
Milne High school.

Followng its two contests with Union
and llrooklyn Law, State had intensive
practice this week and to-morrow night's
tilt is looked upon as a lively contest.
Student tax tickets will admit students
and there will be dancing after the
game.

Coach Baker is well pleased with the
results of the week’s work and looks
for good things from the squad. The
coach has inaugurated a two team sys-
tem, whereby the varsity and a “B”
team both work out with the same sig-
nals and any member of the second
squad can step into the other lineup or
the whole team can go in at once.

College students will occupy special
sections of the bleachers which have been
moved from Ridgcﬁeld park to the gym.

Another large crowd of meters is
looked for. Last week's game brought
forth a crowd of State‘students as big
as that which attended any home game
last season.

The ammal carol sing by which State's
student body marks its entrance into the
magical spirit of Christmas, will be held
Tuesday, December 16, in the college
auditorium, at eight ﬁfteen. To facili-
tate hearty response by students and

tional carols to be sung, will be on sale
