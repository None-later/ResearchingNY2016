JUNIOR CLASS HAS 1

VARIETY__ OF TALENT’

Contributes Musicians, Athletes, Actors And Literary Sharks
To State College Repertoire

"Where, oh where are the jelly juniors?”
If this statement seems untrue, consider their dramatic abilities.
may yet boast of two stars from this class; State College at least boasts
of them. Other juniors have nobiy supported the stars in minor roles or
have kept the stag-c machinery running smoothly.

Nor do they ﬁgure alone in drama-
tic representation; a dainty and fairy-
like toe-dancer gives proof of this;
while two other juniors have made
their debut before the assembly by
singing solo parts in the presentation
of Cantatas. Ruth Lochcr and Es-
ther White may yet sine; as "famous
artists."

Those of the class not interested
in the stage have turned to literary
work. The Quarterly has two eiil-
eient juniors on its stail‘. ltuth Moore
and Mildred Hammersiey. while a
third has contributed several articles
of note to this college magazine. it
has lone- been a question, whether
Ruth Moore will become a poet or an
athlete. Her combined abilities pre-
sent strange paradoxes. Time will
solve the problem.

Nor does she ﬁe'ure alone in the
athletic ﬁeld. Watch Florence Crad-
dock. Mildred I-iammersley and Mar~
g'aret Hutchins! Some of them will
yet star on the varsity team!

Athletics, actresses, dancers, poets,
Hwhat else will this unusual class
produce? Musicians, of course. Have
you noticed that several juniors pin)l
in the college Groin-stra‘.’ And look
at the college chorus. Many a junior
face and voice may he picked out
From it. They are likewise active
in clubs and student organizations,
so what would the Colleen do without
this “up and coming” class?
