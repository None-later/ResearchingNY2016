outjump anybody who has yet been
encountered in the pivot positions of
opposing teams. Knczyuski and
Nephew, who played at forwards in
the early games, have been fast enough
to pile up points in both games. Hor-
nnug, utility forward, was used at
guard in the first two games and
worked well. In Johnson and Juckett

ball captains and guards, Juckctt hav-

traditional opponent, building up a
fourteen point lead in the lirst half and
piling on the tallies in the closing
period. State closed the game with
Ihrec freshmen on the lloor.

The game started in good tempo and
after live minutes State was playing
faster than any time before this sea-
