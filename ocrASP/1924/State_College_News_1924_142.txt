GOD I) ADVICE

"Five more days until Christmas"
seems to he a general slogan for all
colleges. Without trying to throw a
wet blanket over exuberant spirits we
might also begin counting up the days
before mid-years—just for amusement,
of course. Every holiday is followed
by a. certain "let-down" feeling and
the passing of this season is especially
to be regretted by students, for it in-
volves not only a return to work after
an enjoyable vacation, but a crisis—ex-
aminations. These tests should mean
merely a "falling back upon restored
resources" according to our professors,
but to most of us it means a last
frantic effort to reach a desired goal.
If we have been satisﬁed with “getting
by” rather than “getting on" we are
probably in daugcr~not only from
examinations, but also from mental
inertia. Although it is rather a late
hour to sound the alarm, let's shake
ourselves and make a few New Year's
resolutions; we shall not spoil our
Christmas vacation by taking home
our History 2 and calculus books; we
shall do our best to take advantage
of the instruction given between the
close of the holiday session and the
mid-years; we shall not sit up the
night before our ﬁnals—drinking
black coffee and cramming; we shall
fool our instructors by passing the
most ﬁendish of ﬁnals.

EDUCATION WORTH WHILE

“Is education worth all the study,
worry, and work that it is costing
me?" The dejected freshman may
well ask this question. Years ago, a
girl was considered educated if she
had finished Grammar School. VVas'n't
she trained \vcll enough? Wasn‘t she
as successful in life as many of our
college graduates of to-day? At first
thought we might say “yes,” but if we
really think far enough, we will conic
to the conclusion that she lacked very
much. One can learn just for the sake
of knowing. This is selfishness.
One. can learn because it is required
of him. This is indifference. But the
one who learns that hr. may help
others to get a better appreciation and
fuller knowledge of the life worth
while, is grasping the real object of
his existence. A teacher has the op—
portunity to do this. A girl who goes
to State College prepares herself to
come in contact with, and to help
mould countless young minds, thus
adoptingr for her motto “Sapicntia non
stia scd docendi causal,"

We often hear men and women say
that their lives have been greatly in-
fluenced by a former teacher. Tillll
teacher's efforts were not in vain.
liach freshman can look forward to
the day when she will stand before a

in her for the instruction. sympathy,
and understanding which only a truly
devoted teacher can give. This goal
toward which we are all striving is
so glorions'that we can easily forget
our present struggles with History 2
and Chemistry 1, and rest assured that
our education is worth far more than
it costs us. So instead of flingingr
down our books with, “This eternal
homework makes me tired," let us
pick them up with, "The more I learn,
the better 1'11 lcach, so here goes!”
IL, '28.

IT PAYS TO ADVERTISE

There is a rumor about that the
students do not advertise State College
enough. Why not abate this rumor?
Upon inquiry it; was ascertained that
if the students bought more State
College seals and literally covered all
their books and suitcases with them
State would have more renown, for
the students would advertise it at the
many and various places they visit.
e proud of your college! Don't
be afraid to let everybody know what
college you are attending. Let them
discover it for themselves by letting
them see the New York State College
seals on your luggage and books.
When you go home for Christmas
vacation. let your home town see that
you're proud of State. “And,” said my
informer, “there is no need to say that
run can't get seals, for one may obtain
them at the "Co-op."
L. V. 5., ’28.

SENIORS PLEDGE LOYALTY

nounces that until Monday, December

For some time, the Residence Hall
committee has been getting together
reports of the year's work. A copy
of this report is being sent to each
alumnus who has subscribed. together
with a statement of the purchase of
