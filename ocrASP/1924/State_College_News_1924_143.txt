5. N. K. ABOLISHES HAZING 

Believing that the day of hazing as,’
a. means of initiation into rollt-ge life‘
has passed, members of Sigma .\'n
Kappa have voted to join the nation-
wide movement among the leading
colleges and universities to substitute
a more civilized form of fraternity
ritual, This year, for the ﬁrst time
in the history of the fraternity, Sigma
Nu Kappa will not subject the fresh-
man members to the customary phy-
sical initatinn. A new form of initia-
tnry exercise has been arranged aml
will he established as a precedent for
the future.

The motion to abolish hazing was
not carried without opposition. It
excited considerable argument. On
its ﬁnal vote. however, it was accorded
unanimous approval by special motion.
Members of the fraternity believe that
the new ritual will make for more
loyal support and will tie the fraten
nal bonds closer than the antiquated
method of hazing.

To top of? this year's induction of
new members, Sigma Nu Kappa con<
ducted a theatre party at Harmanus

Blcccker Hall, Wednesday night.
December 17, which was attended by
twenty student members and two

faculty members.

MUSIC RECITAL SUCCESSFUL

A memorable concert rendered even
more enjoyable by the personality of
the artist was the pianoforte recitall
given by ()ssip (iabrilowitsch undcrl
the auspices of the Music Associationl
In Chancellor's llali, Friday evening,
llccember 12. i

The famous pianist captivated the
entire house by his masterly rendition,

 

from Handel, Mozart, Bach, lee-
lhoven, Chopin, and his own compo-I
' l’reliminary to each of severali
selections. his comments on the works

 

pretation were instructive as well as
thoroughly enjoyable.

The. entire program was character-
ized by the strength and brilliancy of
(ialn‘ilowitsch's technical perfection
and by the, beauty of his interpretation.
The Ileethnvcn sonata, Op. 27, No. 2.
was given superbly and proved to be
of the most popular numbers.
The t'bopin ballade, noctnrne, and
raise were also brilliantly rendered.
(ialn'ilowilsrh's melody until his
sprightly caprice-burlesque completed
the srhmluled program. 'l‘he Music
Association certainly scored a distinct
triumph in offeringr this concert to
\lbany.

ment held a mass meeting under the

direction of Miss \Vinchell. Plans

eussion.

SHOP AT THE “CO-OP"

The “Co-op" will have on hand a

supply of the best new books, both
fiction and more serious literature
There is no better way to spend
l'fhristmas gift money than to buy
good books. If you wish a book that
is not on hand, the "Co-op" will gladly
order it.
There are still a few of the sport
ats, and if none of the selection
pleases. an order will be taken for any
kind desired.

There will be a complete line of new
banners, pennants, pillows, and stunt
books, some different from any shown
here before, others like those already
admired at the “Co-op." Don't fail
to visit this beautiful selection.

In addition to the college stationery,
beautiful Ravelstone paper in different
tints is offered at a reduction of ﬁfteen

tnnity to economize ought not to be
neglected.

are more interested in business than
in teaching.

THAT'S GOOD—GO ON!

A lighting team wearing the Purple
and Gold of State College was victori-
ous Saturday night. State College
broke into the winning ranks after
two losses. defeating St. Michael's
while almost four hundred students,
crowding the gymnasium, cheered the
live on.

The college was proud of the team
Saturday night, and to-day it is no.
less pleased with the victory. Prophe-
sies of a Stellar team, lavished by
sports writers since the ﬁne showing
made in the Union game, have become
partly true and before the season ends
will be deﬁnitely proved right.

Coach Baker and his team have de-
scrvedly won the college's praise.
State did not hesitate to cheer a losing
team in the closely fought Union and
llrooklyn Law games. It did not
hesitate to applaud a winning squad
Saturday night. And, many times
again before the season ends, it will
cheer another victory.

A year and a half ago. just before
the late President Harding died in
San Francisco, he said to his wife as
she paused in reading aloud to him:
“That's good, go on.‘ Today State
College says to its winning team, in,
praise for the past and conﬁdent hope
for the future: “That's good, go on."

REV. Define; ADDRESSES
CLUB

The Quarterly Communion of New-
man Club was held Sunday, Decem-
ber 14, at the 9:10 mass at St. Vin:
cent dc Paul's Church. A breakfast
followed at the Academy of the Holy
Name. At the speakers' table, Senator
William '1‘. Byrne, Rev. Joseph E.
Dunney, Mrs. Newman, and Miss
Mary Driscoll were seated. Miss
Uriscoll, President of Newman Club,
introduced the guest of honor. Senator
liyrne, who presented a memorable
speech, his topic dealing with the
religious element in true success,
Senator Byrne said in part: “I do
not believe there is any success in life
unless we are constantly appreciative
of the Power that gives us success.
in this country of ours, there are
marvelous opportunities, but the basis
of accomplishment is religion. Never
let us be pleased with our self-sulﬁ-
ciency, our present day attainments.
There is always an undiscovered way
to a new thought, a new ambition, a
new reality."

In behalf of Newman Club, Rev.
Joseph E. Dunney, Spiritual Director,
expressed his appreciation of the
honor of having Senator Byrne pres-
ent on that occasion. Father Dunney
also spoke of the present day tendency
to draw away from Christ and from
religion and of the absence of that
Spartan-like element of religious per-
severance which characterized the
pioneers. Another very enjoyable
part of the morning's program was
the piano solo by Aga.ha Flick, '27.
