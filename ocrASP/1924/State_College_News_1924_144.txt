80 Years Ago State Opened To Students; V ,
Registration of Twenty-Nine Pupils

STORY OF STATE
Part 2

Yesterday, eighty years ago, State
College opened its doors to New York
State's students. Yesterday, in 1844,
its first class matriculated. How this
and other early classes lived and
worked is an important phase of the
mass of facts surrounding the colleges
history.

It will be remembered from last
week's article that after years of agi-
tation New York had voted a normal
school and what preparations for its
beginning had been made. When the

day came for opening exercises, De-'

cember 18, 1844, twenty-nine students
were there. Most of them were from
the Hudson and Mohawk valleys but
some came from farther away.
State street they came to what is now
Van Vcchten Hall and on the third
ﬂoor where Beaumann's Dancing
Academy is to-day they discovered
their school and their principal, David
Page, and the little faculty. They met
the ﬁrst board of trustees and they

'0

attended the opening "exercises."
Principal Page made a speech and
olon el Young made another.

Colonel Young, who was president of
the trustees, said that he believed that
nobody there realized how much the
occasion signiﬁed and that few would
attempt to say to what heights the
school would grow.

That same (lay, for they wasted no
time, the first classes were begun.
The twenty-nine pupils, forebears oi
the present 1050. went to their ﬁrst
lessons and the next day they went to
them again. in a week the school
was getting into the swing of real
work in the four rooms on the top
floor of the old building.

Rented rooms, however, were not
in the plan of the men who were run-
ning the school. Attendance that
jumped to 150 before the end of the
first year, for so last the story of the
state's normal school spread, made
more room essential and the teachers
went to the legislature again, this time
for money for a building. From the
city of Albany they secured free a plot
of ground at the corner of Lodge and
Howard streets back of the Geological
building. On it for $15,000 they had
erected the building that was to he
theirs for thirty-six years. It still
stands and is used for education by the
Christian Brothers. Two sets of plans
for the building were considered.
One, the old report says “was the
more ornamental and cost $700 more."
This plan was adopted. In 1849, the
rapidly growing institution was trans-
ferred to this building.

 

Principal Page never saw the new
building. He died in 1848 and his
cousin, George R. Perkins, who taught
mathematics, was chosen to succeed
him. Mr. Perkins served three years.
While he and his successor Samuel
B. Woolworth were in charge, an
experiment in the education of Indians
was tried. Nine were admitted in
1850 and in three years, five Indian
men and twenty-one Indian women
were students. Only one was gradu-
ated and the experiment was dropped
as a failure.

During the Civil War, David H.
Cachranc was principal. It was at
this time that State tirade its ﬁrst
large contribution to the country's
welfare. Professor Alfred I-Iuested,
who was a member of the mathematic
faculty, resigned his position and or-
ganized a company of volunteers made
up entirely of the college students. He
marched at their head to the war.
One hundred and ﬁfty-three alumni,
in addition to this company, were en-
rolled in the Union armies. Eighteen
were killed; ten in battle and eight
dying of wounds in hospitals. Pro-
fessor I-Iuestcd survived and returned
to the college faculty where he later
became head of his department. He
served in that capacity for thirty years
longer.

(Sidelights on amusing incidents in
the college's early work and the story
of the ﬁrst great change in its pur-
pose will bc related in the third article
to he published January 16.)

ART LECTURE

Miss Pcrinc, of the Art department.
gave a most interesting and instructive
lecture in assembly last Friday, on
etchings and how they are made.
She described in detail the various
methods of making etchings. There
were to have been lantern slides to
illustrate her talk, but due to some
mishap they were not able to be used.
Among the etchings which Miss Per—
iiic showed were many of her own.
She called the attention of the student
body to some of the best known
artists‘of to-day, such as: L. Benson,
Barton, G. C. Wales, G. T. Plowman.
and William Simmons. Works of
these artists, besides those of many
others, have been on exhibition in the
rotunda for the past two weeks.
