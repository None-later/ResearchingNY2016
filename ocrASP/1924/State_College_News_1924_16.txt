ASKING YOUR PARDON

The juniors on the News board

wish to apologize for misquoting
members of the student council in
the article on Chapel Attendance

which appeared in the junior issue.

NEW MOVEMENT STARTED

“Give the faculty a show." is the
sentiment which has been started in
college by the Public Speakin r class.
'i‘his group. composed of mem ers of
all the classes. expressed the unani-
mous opinion that there was not will-
cicnt social life at State. One of the
principal reasons given for this (leliic-
iency was that faculty and students
had too little in common outside the
class room. To prove that there was
a remedy. the class gave Dr. Thomp—
son a banquet which was most Sui;—
ccssful in arousing the enthusiasm
of the class to promote a new rela-
tion between professors and students.

(I s such as this which i‘ostcr
exprc ion of student opinion and of-
fer solutions to current problems are
of more value to the college than
most people realize.

 

TIME TO RENEW
NEW YEAR VOWS

Once more we have passed the mid-
year mark and are now priming our-
selves and getting set for the ﬁnal
sprint. Twenty weeks viewed as an
entity are just a brief period of time.
but from an individual standpoint
they mean twenty weeks packed full
of work and fun. And the fuller
they are packed with these ingredi-
ents, the richer and deeper will be
their oll’ccts on our experience of life.
How much more satisfying is it to
live each day well. to perform the
required duties in the daily routine.
and just to enjoy sixty seconds of
each minute. Such a procedure of
living will conserve energy and the
expenditure of brain power along in
the middle of June. It is then espe-
cially that we will feel the joy and
exhilaration of daily accomplishment.
When the spring fever and the bal-
my air of the "printemps" gets in-
to our blood. it sums up ambition and

will give material credit to our good
intentions later on.

STUDENT OPINION

To the Editor of the News:
Congratulations to [924! In their
midst (hidden from under class eyes)
lodges the true Spirit of College.
’l‘hru all the noise 01' bickerings over
ti-ivialitics comes the clear small voice
saying that real College Spirit" is a
sense of justice which will cause us
to realize that we have receiva much
from our Alma Mater. and that we
owe in return a high measure of re--
spect and fidelity." '24 any; that!
‘27 realizes the ignominy of coming
to State one or two or three years
later than our honored brethren, it
appreciates the need ol‘ strong mea-
sures to hold its brethren hordes in
check: but it cannot uppruc th
feeling that only in upper cl' es can
real College Spirit reside.

Do you

have the most interest? We were
given the "Freedom ol’ tho College"
by the President and the Dean at the
opening of tho ycui'——“ it all exists
for you." We haven’t forgotten. but
we are receiving mostly the “li‘roe-

VOTED DOWN

The student body of State has dc—
clarcd its disapproval of the institu-
tion of an honor sy ‘ m by voting it
down, 2 to 1. This situation is dis-
graceful no mattor how any of us
may feel about it; for, after all is
said and done. the fact remains that
a college which is training for load-
ership and service to the young folks
of high school age should at least
take a stand to encourage the main-
tenance of honor among its students.
The majority which opposed the ac~
ceptancc 01' this system can be di-
vided into three groups, i.e.. the
cheaters. the conscientious objectors.
and the indill'crent.

The division called cheater is in
reality small. but mwertheloss inilu-
ential. It subdivides into the liabi-
tual cheaters and those who will cheat
when they are sure of “getting by.”
These types are unﬁt to be college
students, but there is always the pos-
sibility that they will seine day rcal-
ice that they are the losers. For
when self-respect is gone. what is
. t‘.

Perhaps the largest number of stu-
dents could bc classed as the consci-
entious objectors. who rise in wrath
against the measure which requires
reporting of law-breakers. Many of
them have an illusion to the eil'cct
that those favoring the honor system
would enjoy getting their classmates
“in Dutch: This is silly, as well as
untrue. There are those who declare
that they would under no circumstan—
ces report personal friends. The only
refutation to that argument is tnnt
they are poor friends who would stoop
to potty dishonor in the classroom.
Friends worth retaining will proﬁt by
correction and will be the better for

 

having ideals to live up to. Students
need to acquire the larger point of
view in which they see that the re-
putntion oi". their Alma Mater is no
ﬁner. no more admirable than that of
the individuals in it.

The third group is composed of the
scores of those indiil’erent to the out-
come of the issue. Occupied with
their own small interests they .l'oel
no responsibility for the general wel-
fare of our college. It is the } stu-
dents who make us wonder it Dr. A.
Herbert Gray is not correct when he
says that American college men and
women are stupidly satisfied with
their lot and unaware of their re-
lation to or responsibility concerning
the problems confronting civilization.
in this ago of science no country.
no community can long remain in
isolation and out of communication
with other parts of the world. The
idea of our not being our brother’s
keeper is, however. losing grouml for
we are learning through bitter expe-
icnce that cvuryonc must work inter-
dependently in order 'to eii'cct any
improvement in existing conditions.
The community's and nation’s fight
for supremacy over evil is analytic—
ally the same as the imllvidual’s ﬁght
against the evil tendencies within
himself. It is the responsibility of
those who perceive the right to on-
courage others along the way. Booth
'l‘nrkington reached the heart of the
mutter in his statement of the case.
“Man has to win his freedom from
himself. men in the light have to light
against men in the dark."

After over four hundred voted
down the honor system in chapel we
were on our feet yelling “Rah——
State!” It would be well to ponder
on what we were cheering for. It
must be more than noise and cnthu~
siasm. the foundations should he
truth and loyalty and faith in ouch
other. Let us look to the founda-
tions ol‘ our Alma Mater, and when
we have laid our college spirit upon
the ﬁnest possible ideals our cheers
and our songs will ring out with Lin-
i-rring loyalty and irresistable powmx

TIME-BINDING US
(From The New Student)

“More time! More time!" the poor
over-organized, i'ushed-to-dcath col-
lege students are crying. Our life is a
feverish round ot‘ one thing after
another! We stay up all night and
ash about all‘day and chor ﬁnd sa-
tisi‘action.

Dr. Karl 'l‘. Waugh. Dean ol.’ the
College ol' Liberal Arts 01' the Uni-
vcrsity of Southern California has
surveyed the activities of the students
of Southern California and. evidently
believing that the cause of low grades
is due to the fact that students do
not order their livos by a fixed solic-
dulc. has made out a program allot-
ting some task to each hour.

t ﬁrst this program appears ra-
thcr startling. ’l‘hcn calculation rc-

veals the fact that Dr. \Vaugh has.
only dissected a ﬁve day week. 'l‘horoI

are evidently two days, then, on which
one may enjoy a lazy freedom. The
rest of the week is to be divided as
follows:

Class recitations—sixtecn hours

Preparatory study—thirty-two hrs.

Dressing and meals—twelve hours
Exercise and recreation—twelve hrs.

Sleep—forty-cight hours

This makes a total of 120 hours or
ﬁve full days. it sounds rather ideal,
but simply doesn’t work that way.
One would like to do some question-
nairing of students. How many ever
got 9% hours sleep regularly? How
many over ate 3 meals and dressed—-
if only onco——in 21": hours? And
then—the crowning luxury—6V;
hours a day for study! Given a stu-

dent und a few books and peaceful
quietness. and this might happen—
but we are given so much more! Do
you remember a day—outside of ex-
amination week-when you had six
and one-half hours to study and nine
and one halt in which to slocp'l Two
of the precious six Were perhaps spent
in waiting for “meetings” which i.‘all~
oil to meet, and the rest in hunting
for people who had to be seen about
something or other. I’ r o i' (E s s or
Wuugh’s scheme is most uppealing~~
nspociully the two wholly unscheduled
days. But somehow. it doesn't ﬁt
the existing college order. Still_.
every perfect man ol‘ the world should
include Utoniu.

The News desires more expressions

honors. College men and Colli-go girls.

All opinions should be directed in
