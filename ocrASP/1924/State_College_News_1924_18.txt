“Modern electrical theory in gen-
erle and ‘adio in particular was born
in Albany Where Henry was born.
He was and still is the greatest Ameri-
can phycist and the greatest Aim-n
can idealist in science. and his life-
work is the best prool.’ that denmera-
cy can do great things in higher scl—
entilic endeavor.-Miehnel l'upin.”

 

 

Joseph Henry‘s l'ather and mother
came from Scotland to Deleware
County, New York, and moved thencn
to Albany where the boy was born
124 years new this night. Michael
Faraday had preceded him into this
world by eia'ht years, and the two,
unknown to each other. were destined
to labor in the same field of electrical
research. Henry was a poor boy, his
father died when he was but a younw
ster, and his mother had more than
she could do to support her family,
so the boy, not very strong and not
very studious at school, was sent oil‘
to the little country village of Gal-
way, in Saratoga county, to live with
his maternal grandmother. Faraday
too, was a poor boy, a baker’s son,
so those two little fellows, both to
become giants in the same science,
had about the same handicap at the
start—4hr.- kind ol‘ handicap which
sometimes puts a young fellow on his
mettle and makes him fight for suc~
cess, and sometimes discourages and
keeps him down.

Becomes Fascinated in Books

In the district school at Galwagr
the young Henry seems to have taken
but a casual and rather detached in-
terest in education, but chasing a rah.
bit one day he followed it through
a hole in the cellar wall of the village
library, and seeing a light at the top

Works For Silversmith

i He was only M years old when he

 

Went back to Albany to become clerk

lto a Silversmith, who l‘ortunatuly‘

il'uiled and sot the boy loose again
to give free rein to his love for the
drama. 'I‘ho tradition remains that
he organized a dramatic club amonp;
the boys, dramatized a story or wrote
a play and staged it below: their own
little community. ’l'Imes were hard
at home, there was no money to pay
school bills, the mothe had to take
boarders to help out, and finally at
Hi the boy was taken sick at home.“
This sickness was, as he has himself]
said, the turn in the road for thel
restless lad.

To Erect Memorial

Henry's great place in the history
ol.‘ science, not only in America but
in the world must be better visualized
to the people of this land, and we
have proposed here in Albany to
erect an enduring memorial to the
man and the place of his great work.
Indeed, so much in earnest are we
that $15,000 have already been rais-
ed for this purpose, and we need as
much more. We believe the day not
I'ar away when the thousands of peo-
ple in this country who owe their
living and happiness to Henry's l'un-
damental discovery will recognize
more fully their debt to his memory.
