GETTING ON

“1 got by without getting ilunkcd
out" is not an uncommon statement
heard in college corridors now-a-days.
Perhaps the persons making these re-
marks really do think they have boon
clever in gutting—by; evidently a col-
loge education means only to them
the rrcoiving of as high a grade as
possible on a little white card with
the least cll'ort possible. “Getting-iiy”
individuals must have as their motto
“give to the world the least you have,
and hope for the best to come back
to you." They look for l'ull~valuc
returns from shady investments, and
they are perfectly willing to accept
the same, ’l‘hcir less fortunate neigh—
bors, the. “ilunkics” are more honor-
able in that they bear the penalty
of their mistakes. Perhaps sometime
in later life the "gotters-by” will re-
alize they were beaten at their own
game; sometime they may wake up
to the fact that people get from life
just what people put into life; that
bluil‘ing and shamming is of no avail,
but true, honest service is what
counts.

“SPARE THE ROD AND
SPOIL THE CHILD”
Would honor pledged have more
effect on the student body than con-
tinued reminding of college tradi-
tions and laws? At every assembly
meeting students are reminded the
order in which they should leave. This
is disregarded. nevertheless. and
freshmen are seen rushing ahead of
the upper classmen just as though
nothing had been said. Why can't
the “sophs” give them a lesson? Why
are they allowed to usurp so much
wicked authority? Freshmen of other
other colleges know their places;
while here. they care nothing about
keeping law and order, but brag about
how many laws they are able to
break. A little hazing would not
harm them but might do good toward
making better students.

STATE COLLEGE NEWS,

WOODROW WILSON
EULOGIZED BY PRO-
FESSOR HIJLEY

Woodrow Wilson as world leader
and teacher was eulogized by Profes-
sor IIidlcy last week before the three
hundred freshmen. Referring to the
war‘Itlme President as "the outstand-
ing leader of the twentieth century,”
Mr. Hidicy said that “although Wood-
row Wilson will go down in history as
the Great War President. he deserves
to be called the Great Peace President.
The constructive achievements of his
first three years of oillcc escapc no-
tice. Wilson, he declared. was the
world’s best-known soldier. His four
rules by which nations can live amic-
ably were: equality of nations, aboli-
tion of territorial gain by conquest,
peace through understanding and
agreement, and reduction of arma-
ments.

As a great teacher, a college pro-
fessor. and a college President, also,
Wilson should be known to the teach—
ing world. the History lecturer said.
“It was Wilson’s habit to enter a lcc-
ture promptly and to complete his
address on time. He used no notes
and was intensely impatient of stu-
pidity.”

ETIOUE'I'TE

Among the various courses oli'crcd
by the modern college oi.’ to-day per-
haps the least considered is on in eti-
quotto. Oi‘ Coursf! etiquette is somc~
thing of which we are supposed to
have, at least, tho rudiments of lie-
l‘ori: wu cntor (follogr. but even this at
times sonms doubtful.

’l‘hero can be no doubt that sue
a course " oli'crod, would have a
large a" ‘ation. it would in: pure-
ly elective and should be open to all
students. It might well be divided
into various parts each dealing with
a. certain phase oi? the subject. This
part of our education should not ho
i’icglectml; it is something that we as
future teachers will ho oxpcctcd to
know. it is easy to do the right thing
lil’ we know when to do it. Such a
'course as this would help us to know
whcn to do the correct thing and how
to do it. Why not create a demand
for such a subject along‘ with one in
General Science?

JOSEPH HENRY INITI-
ATION FILLED WITH
PEPARD FUN

 

A howling Success

Tuesday evening, February 12,
marked an epochal initiation in the
history of Joseph Henry Club. At
8 o’clock in Room 150 the first de-
gree was administered to a class of
twenty initiates in the form of an
electric shock. There was much timi.
dity and drawing away from the ap-
paratus of torture. in some case three
stalwart men were required to elec-
trocute the hands of one victim.
