lMEN EXPLAIN MYSTERY
or WEARING APPAREL

 

Their Malia Same as Girls '-"Firsl
Out, [325! Dressed"

For some time it has been a source
of some wonder and unusual brain
activity, mostly guessing, as to where
State's men get their great variety
of outer garments—aim, more espe~
eially, how they not them.

But the veil of mystery which has
shrouded this eighth wonder oi? the
seven wonders of the world has ﬁnal-
ly and exasperatingly been pene-
trated by the sharp witted Locker
ltoom corps oi? Sherlock llolmes’s
wise and otherwise.

'l‘oday. State’s Beau Brummels are
no longer objects of beauty or amazo-
ment. At least, not to the Locker
Room bloodhounds. ’I‘hey are the pi-
tiloss butts of criticism and ridicule.

Out in South Allen street, where
the West begins, and men are men
’and can't be anything else, there is
a domicile for State colh-a'e men.

Still further, in another section of
the city. more familiarly donig‘natml
as Washington avenue, or out in West
Albany where every man is either in
the railroad shops or the movies (tin-
(.'oloninl, not Hollywood), tin-re is
situated another abode for men.

Herein lies the secret ol' the sacred
wardrobe.

“Jimmy” ("arrolan is the original
lloau I'lrummol of Kappa [Min llho.
.lack Hayes is the style-plus of Sienna
Nu Kappa.

 

Herein lies another secret of the
sacred \vardrolw.
It is the unwritten law. as I’ro-

ll'ossor Hutchinson might say in ex-
1plainine' the British constitution, at
l'IlCll of these so-called “flat” houses
that the lirst man up has his choice
of the wardrobes. Last man to get
dressed—well, he’s the most easily
irecomiizable one in college each day.
‘ 'I'hel'cin lies the Q. E. D. of the
i State College style setters.

There has been a a'eneral scramble
amonp; the freshmen durinp; the past

been endeavorine to have their quiz
sections in their various subjects

eision that a professor must be an
easy marker.

'I'O-DAY’S KIND THOUGHT

“Don’t forget the birds when the
snow is on the ground because we’re
always glad to see them when the
spring; comes roun'." Just a few
crumbs :1 day outside your doorstep
or window will save many a bird
from hunger and perhaps from death.
Let us cherish our feathered friends
for they mean much to us.
