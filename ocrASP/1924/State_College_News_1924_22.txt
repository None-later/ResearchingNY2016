WHY STUDENTS ARE STUPID
By William Allen White

 

(From The New Student)

Forty years (19:0 and more. when
on Americnn boy or girl went to col-

education. A student; at" the lust Iren—

he come from a l'nmily in which there
were u ,i'ew weli‘read hooks. ll,‘ he

have no culturnl lunckerouml what-

and reading. and who record educn-

making a livine'.

Hence we have the hordes oi~ stu-
pid, ineducahle college sludellts. The
college spirit, outside of collee't' ath«
