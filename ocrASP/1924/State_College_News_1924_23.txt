POINT SYSTEM FOR
COLLEGE HONORS

IN PROGRESS '

Student Council Makes Plans For
ew Ruling

Regulation of the number of oili~
ces which may he held by a single
student is being- discussed by tiie Stu-
dent Council with a view toward pre-
senting resolutions to the student
body.

Too often, according;- to a member
ol' the council, who was interviewed
by the News this week, the elliciency
of organized student activities is im-
paired by the inability oi the oilicials
to devote them suil‘ic' -nt time. The
council feels that limitation of the
number at positions which one stu~
dent may hold in college organiza-
tions on the basis of a pie—arranged
point system will ziil'ect a chance for
the better. Aside from the evil which
it is asserted is done to the organize.~
tions. is the cil'cct upon studies which
champions of the idea declare is often
disastrous.

It' the matter reaches the Student
Assembly it will probably be pre-
sented with a gradation of points pre-
pared by student representatives. The
major and minor oilices in college life
would then each be alloted an appro-
priate number of points, and ii maxi-
mum number for one person would
also be provided for.

The system has been usod and is
being: used in other colleges and uni-
versitics.
