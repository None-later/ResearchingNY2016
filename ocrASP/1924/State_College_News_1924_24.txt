IN PROTEST

The discussions board in the halls
since the mid-semester marks came
out have been a most forceful argu—
ment in favor of abolishing final ox-
aminations. While many students
were delighted to find that cramming
had given them a ll grade, others
were greatly incensed to ﬁnd that ex—
cnllent class work during the so .
tor rewarded them with only a “C.
The consensus of opinion was that

  

final grades were not fair. and that‘'

they did not adequately repay a stu—
the time he had spent in his courses.

A COLLEGE SYMPHONY

To be content with the clothes you
have; to possess a few true friends
rather than go with a crowd; to seek
knowledge instead of marks; to study
for the truth in all things; to help a

your own grades: to remen‘ibnr that
your body is God’s holy temple. and
that even Phi Betta Kappa is not
worth the key of perfect and un-
broken health; to lend often. to hor-
row seldom; to stand for something
“worth while” in the college com.
munity; to take an active part in
class all'airs, and in the church of your
choice; to have the true college spirit
and a broad. catholic view of life;
in a word so to live. day by day, that

“THE CONFLICT" PLEASED
LARGE AUDIENCE

Advanced Dramatics Class I’lnys
Continue to he Popular

A little bit of life, darkened with
pathos and brightened with humor!
In “The Conflict.” the Advanced Dra—
matics Class, under the direction of
Priscilla Jones. presented that type
of delightfully human play . l'losalinc
Grocnberg furnished a true interpre-
tation of “Emelio,” the talented.
worldly‘wise oldest of a family of
four. and Evelyn Dutcher, as the aus-
tere. unrelenting mother. successful-
ly thwarted her daughter’s plan for
severing the home ties and “going to
New York." Then came “Bess” the
typical. carefree school-girl sister,
played by Mary Vcdder. and, lastly,
“Bob.” the breezy little brother, por-
trayed by Marjorie Bayless.

Much praise is due to all the play-
ers and to the director for the ex-
ceptional ability shown in the pro-
duction of this line dramatic enter-
tainment.

STATE LOSES 0N
SCORE BUT GAINS
FIGHTING [EPUTATION

Middlebury Gama Best of Season for
Many Reasons
Ol-‘PONENI‘S GOOD SPORTS.

"Peggy" Cnton’s hypnotic eye
failed to sway its usual directory pow-
ers over the pig-shin sphere liisl, Fri-t

 

ay night and State went down to.
defeat at the hands of Mltltllttlllll'V‘
college on thi- home court. 'l‘liu see
was 21 to IG. but it; was not ii d
which should be chalked up again .
the team. for it was a glorious buttlul
from start to finish. and State‘s mun;
deserve to be heartily congratulatodi
for the viilient struggle they .fouglit.‘

One of the pleasing aspects of the.
game was. the fact; that State enjoyed
the long end of tilt! score at the end
of the first half and they had given
the Vermont boys such a scare by
their stollcr playing and unrelenting
lighting that the Middlebury varsity
was unable to gain a foothold in the
second half until after sort-rid niin~
utns of play.

These ﬁrst ten minutes and ten
more to follow \VUI'U filled with more
excitement; than any other whole
game in which State has parti 'pnted.
ill. was a gruelling. sou-sawing strug-
Ilglc between two l'nxt. lighting teams.
each out to establish a nann- in the
collegiate world. State won the hat-
tle. but unfortunately. lost out; on
‘tlic scorn in the second half.

Carrolan’s injury in the lirst half
‘muy easily be attributi-d for the loss

shooters.

Former Captain Shin-Icy. who took
('Jai'rolan’s place. staged a comeback
for the first. few minutes he was in
the gamt- when he netted a pretty
shot after a hard dribble. His was
going good in the second half when
Coach Wogncr replaced (iari'olan.
Here again the smooth working ma-
(than was temporarily disrupted. The
substitution probably was wise. but
it was costly.

Middlebury players deserve consid—
t-rablc credit; for their clean-cut play-
mg. despite the unexpected closeness
of the score. It was unusual for the
Green Mountain boys to feel so un-
comfortable at the hands of what
they classed a second-rate team, as
is shown by their playing of the sec-
ond team in the ﬁrst half. Mathe-
matically speaking. Midillcbury is
better than Harvard in basketball.

Some action ought to be taken
against students leaving assem-

coui‘teous to the person speak-
