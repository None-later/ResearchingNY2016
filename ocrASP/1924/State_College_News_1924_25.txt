SIGNS OF SPRING

“Oh, so Lhnt's it”, everyone was
saying an thiy neared the auditorium
and hogan to sniti‘ the paint. We’ve
been wondering .tor the longest time
the meaning ot.‘ the iuinliei; and the
hammering: and general nphua ad
which rudely interrupted Dr. '.l.‘hoinp-
son’s singing classes and iieeeasitateil
everyone rushing to liooin ii where ‘it
is iinpoaaiidu to gel; prepe' air willi—
out; l'I'ei-zini: altogethei'.’ Well, we
love thing‘s fresh and new. so we
won’t mind the inconvenience For a
little while, and we’re hoping that the
freshmen and smilioniores in their
atrit'e won’t attempt. such measures as
to throw anthine' up at. our nit cell.
illL-J and spoil it. ’2 .
