G A A SLEIGH RIDE

Jingle bells! Jingle bells! And
the annual C. A. A. sleigh ride was
in progress. From the minute that
double the members signed up up<
pearcd to be loaded into the two
Sleigbs to the last of the beans and
coil'ee, a spirit of banter and merri-
ment pervaded the party. Dr. Creas-
(lale and Miss Morris dissertated via
the banjo-Like on the beauties of the
moonlight.

On their return. the participants of
the ride discovered the “Chem-date"
to be the scene of unusual and inter-
esting activities. Ethel DuBois, ’27,
and Dot Taylor. ’25, busin presiding
over caldrons of coll'ee. cocoa, beans,
and potatoes, the president of G.A.A.
rushing about in a wild search for
pickles. Room 250 had been trans-
formed into a cafeteria, a typical
“canal-med lunch” with chairs in a
family cirlcle. Here Ruth Moore, ’25
dispensed beverages, rolls, and dough-
nuts. Never were there such beans
or creamed potatoes, even unto the
second and third helping— and sh-sh,
but some say the potatoes were
scorched. In fine, the 1924 sleigh
ride was jolly!

MONEY ROLLS INTO 4
OFFICE AS RESULT ,
OF LETTER SERIES‘
As a result ot‘ Professor Sayle’s
letter to unpledged alumni, and “bil-
lets doux” in the form of notices of
payments due sent to pledged alumni,
the olllco ot' the Residence Hall Coin-
mittee, really a part of Dean I-‘ierce’s
olllce, is as busy as the ollice ot’ the
Income Tax Department at payment
time. The new pledges this week
amount to $440.00 The total receipts
for the week have been $l,7=ll.0l)
The entire amount paid to li‘obrunry
lti ‘is $35,875.68. while pledges and
contributions together make a total
of $t0(i,l$7.l’»0.
liut perhaps you think that just re-
ceiving money and pledges should not
mean much work. it would not, but
the proper recording of each pledge
or payment in Miss 'I‘allmadge's sys-
tem ot' card catalogues is a vastly
dill'erent thing. l‘lach alumnus,
pledged or unplodged. has a card in
the ﬁrst or “ name tile”. When a
pledge or a sum ol.’ mom-y is received,
two more cards are made out. One
is placed in the year llle, the other in
the address lilo. in the year lile,
tiny colored tags mark the cards as
belonging to persons who have paid

all they will, non-grinlualw who have ‘

these cards all later payments

Some of the letters received with
payments and gifts show how elite:

’CELLO CONCERT HIGHLY
PRAISED BY STUDENTS

’l‘he ‘cello concert by Georges Mi-
quelle at Chancellor’s Hall on Satur-
day evening, February lli, does not
belong to the category at “treats for
music lovers,” it was too compelling
a program for any light judgment.
The selections ranged through the en—
tire scale ot‘ basic emotions from the
sweeping majesty of Grieg, through
the poignanee of “KM Nidrei” to the
piquant daintiness of “The Bee.” The
fourth group ()I' semi-cl' 5 proved
most popular with the audience al—
though the ’cellist and accompanist
seemed in most perfect accord in the
Chopin selection.

The tonal production of the Grieg
Sonata was markedly full. The mas-
terly technique of Miquelle was most
evident in “The Bee.” Wherefore, it
is indeed an accomplishment for the
Music Association to have had the
privilege of oli'ering this concert to
Albany.
