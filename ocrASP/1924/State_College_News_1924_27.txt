State because four houses from this

serious. The three houses near them

closed and the inhabitants were told

I Now, as far as this newspaper ar-

But the truth is sometimes like the

And so, fundamentalism. or in
piaincr words, the white collar uni-
form. is again victorious over Ino-
dernism or radicalism, as exempliﬁed
by the striking green plaid shirt worn
for the ﬁrst time in public by “Jim-
my” Carrolan of K. D. R. fame, but
reputed to be owned by someone else
of less notoriety.

would be conducted by the Congres-

 BEAT ST. STEPHENS! I

The St. Stephen’s game is to be
lplayed in the College gymnasium
‘ March ’7.
'eil‘ort to be ready to carry oil a vic~
tory, and St. Stephens is anticipating
an exciting Ixame as well as a \‘iCtory.
The college as a whole is ready to
hack the team to the limit. Friday
night, March 7, the door tender in
the gymnasium is planninp; to look at
EVERY Tax Ticket, which all goes
to show that State is going to win the
game!

LOCKE ADDRESS TO BE
GIVEN TUESDAY
Reverend Locke, of one of the lie-
formed Churches in the city, will ad-
dress the Y. W. C. A. on Tuesday,
March 4. in the college auditorium.
Reverend Locke was to have spoken
last week, but the “deferred” speech
will probably prove all the more in-
teresting.

 

The team is exertng every

 

'today with the burning- desire to show the Maroon they are not to be

“*0 During the last half of the current

lbasketball season State has proven
'to the satisfaction of many followm-s
that it has the stamina and sportsman-
ship to go up agaisnt a superior team
and put up a great battle until the
ﬁnal whistle is blown. Tomorrow
nie'ht the Purple and Gold jerscycd
sphere tosscrs will prove their metal.

In Jack Dolan and Dick Wasscr-
man, State's forwards, most likely
Hornung and Caton, will be pitted
up against the stellar guards of the
Eastern college area. The Colgate
squad comprises a grand array of
forwards, and it has not yet been de-
cidcd which pair will start. In any
event. however. it is hoped by State
fans that Captain Juckett will be able
to match up with Davies auainst the
Maroon sharpsl‘Iooters. Gainer. as
usual, will take care of the tip-off
for State.

Time was the predominant element
attributing to State's most recent de-
feat last Friday night at the hands
of. St. Michael’s. The Purple and
Gold outplayed the visitors in every
branch of the name, except basket:
shooting». It seemed almost impos-
sible during the last ten minutes of
the name for State to score.

When the whistle was sounded for
the end of the game, St. Michael’s
led by seven points, the score being
24 to 17, but it was only by a sudden
change of form that the opposing five
netted the winning baskets. It was
anybody’s game up until five minutes
before the end of play. St. Michael's
took a spurt in the last few minutes
and won the race.
