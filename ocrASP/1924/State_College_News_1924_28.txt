STUDENT OPINION
A
Most honorable lady Editreas;—

I have to say some words (inscrip-
tive of arrangements being made on
the dome of your most esteemed or-
dertorium. The arrangements are
most noisy to the eyes and ears. cs~
pccially when they expound upon
them with indolcnms. Why. thereupon
do they continue to do'.I I wish to
understand. First the estimable
paint applicrs climb the rope to the
top floor. then they put on brown
paint to the ceiling until they contem-
plate dislike for it than they eradicate
it with yellow. What for is this
done? I do not digest.

Also the boards exempt the slats
from safety for pedestrians who are
seated there within. I have ex-
panded under the [light of a paint-
brush which elaborated my hair to
'ellow most inconveniently. How
ong? I want to be instructed. Might
I interrogativc also why those so-
callcd reparations could not be more
commodious in the summer time
when nine hundred juvenile school
keepers are not within the expanse
of these most authoritative halls?

Where to. oh most noble cditrcss,
am I to sing a chorus and absorb an
oration? My vocal piano suil'ers
mostly.

Kind and gracious lady. who in-
dulges thn publik’s opinion. will you
continue it not and why?

Humbly your friendship.

CLASS SPIRIT AND
COLLEGE SPIRIT
. To the writer much of the present
difﬁculty of adjustment in the college
seems to be the result of a rather
mistaken notion concerning the rela-
tion between class spirit and college
spirit. The essential duty of manage-
ment is to make for smoothness in

 

 

 

 

operation of any organization. There

is a deplorable lack of smoothness
and harmony in State College. No
matter whether the fault is that of
the general student attitude, or the

STATE COLLEGE NEWS,

result of too feeble attempts at pre-
venting discord by the student organ-
izations, the fact remains that we are
a long way from an eillclently func-
tioning organization.

There is a great danger in confus-
ing the hustle and stir and enthUs.»
asms of a welLdeveloped class spirit
with its sister in name only, College
Spirit. There is precious little con-
nection. it any. between the two. Let
us define class spirit as the organized
and collected interests of the people
of one particular class entering to-
gether. Class spirit thrives on the
excelling ot’ this organization along
social, scholastic. and athletic lines.
Class spirit seems more to be judged
by the things out over on the othc
' than on the standard 01' the
Itself. in other words, it very
rapidly becomes interclass antagon-
isms. Theoretically this is unneces—
sary, but actually it is quite inevit-
able. It is only an extension of the
same personally-selﬁsh spirit that pro-
vadcs our modern system.

It is not at all the thing to hobnob
with members of other classes——
evurything for the glory of the class,
and let it end there.

Class spirit as such is necessarily
dcpcmlcnt on artiﬁcial incubation and
nurture. When the miscellaneous
group enters there is no such thing as
class spirit. It must be whipped into
shape by violent mousurcs. aug-
mented by every known sensational-
ism. and strongthonml by uppqu to
the desire to crow over others rather
the desire to crow with others. Ap-
parently we have not gotten away
from the attitude that We are holier
than thou; we are the people, knowl-
edge ends with us; and such.

All this struggle for the best place
is supposed to develop an overwholun
ing love for our Alma Mater. You
hear it earnestly declared that class
spirit dovolops school spirit. '
saying that a fanatical lOVi' for my
state. in which I am only happy when
[ see it winning over all the rest.
will engender a deep patriotic love
for the United States. They are not
the outgrowths one of the other. but
the opposite extremes of thought and
action.

Surely we aren’t missing the subt-
ler thing which is real College Spirit.
[1' it is anything at all it is a real
LOVE and RESPEC’I‘ for the college,
for what it stands for, its inspiration
and development in our own lives. Do
you expect to look back with plea-
sure at the petty quarrels that oh-
structed your way back in college
days? Are you going to remember
with most pleasure the (lay when you
two irreconciliblcs got together and
told each other just what you
thought, or the time when you open-
cd your heart in honesty and frank-
ness to another ard discussed some
of the things that were close to your
heart as important. vital needs of
your life and ideals? Bickerings,
petty (marrels, ﬁne shows of author-
ity—these never produce harmony or
essential well being.

Can’t we got away from this strug-
glu for place in State College? We
are supposedly here with the highest
ideals and motives. the ﬁnest type of
altruism. are we going to murder it
by scraps for the ﬁght’s sake? Is
our attitude to be essentially selfish
or unselﬁsh? Let us learn to say
“State for State’s sake” and stop
saying “Twenty-blank for twenty-
blank’s sake.”

SHELF IN LIBRARY ~

 

New Mathod of Encouraging Altru-
istic Tendencies

A kind of student loan of books
is suggested by Miss Potter by means
of which altruistic people who posses
reading they think might interest
others may share their literary tron-
sul'cs. The idea was sugg stud to
Miss Potter when several persons of-
i’oi'cd to place at the disposal oi? the
college for a short time books from
their personal libraries. Watch the
small collection on the library desk
[or books which particularly interest
you, and if you have a copy or so in
which you particularly delight and
you would like to see others inter—
ested in. take it to Miss Potter.

ONION-INSPIRED TEARS

HELP SOLEMNIZE H. E.

CLUB INI'I'IATION

All the mysteries of home—making
wcrc disclosed Tuesday evening, Feb-
ruary it). when twonty-throo tromb-
ling undorclassnmn Worn initiated by
Home Economics Club. ’l‘wo fresh-
Incn. apparently greatly afflicted with
the solemnity of the occasion, stood
with tears streaming down their
cheeks while they peeled onions, and
explained just what they were doing
and why they were doing it. Two
others, blindfohlml. gave a demon-
stration of the proper way to feed
cereal to a child. Many other (l0<
mcstic problems were solved by this
capable group.

But H. E. Club does not believe
that woman’s place is always in the
kitchen. The initiates also provided a
program of solo dancing, chorus sing-
ing and story-telling which proved
very entertaining. “Speak the speech,
I pray you,” was given in a way that
would surely have made Miss Futtcr-
er turn green with envy. A singing
lesson proved the ability of the ini-
tiates to teach anything—even thing‘s
they do not know themselves.

After the stunts, the meeting was
called to ordei‘, and the constitution
was read to the initiates, who signed
it. and thus became full-iledgcd
members of the club. In the business
meeting that followed, it was decided
to change the time of the club—meet-
mgs from Tuesday evening to Tues.
day afternoon at four o’clock.

SYDDUM HALL
.FROLICKED IN SNOW
A dinner. a sleigh-ride, and a
dance—all ﬁgured to make Thursday,
February 21. an eventful evening for
the Syddum Hall girls. Jingling bells

and sparkling snow; crisp air provok- N

ing an appetite; a warm dinner;
lighted halls and good (lance music—
what other pleasures could be added?
A congenial company and “kindly
disposed" chaperons. of course; nor
were either lacking. Ask those who
attended.
