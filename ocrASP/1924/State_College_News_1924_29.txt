MICHAEL FARADAY
17914807

Apprentice toxin English book-
binder. Attracted the atten-
tion of Sir Humphrey Davy,
becoming his assistant. “The
greatest cxpnrimentulist of all
times," says one biographer.
The electrical unit Furnd was
named {or him.

 

in 1880 the Edison
Electric Illuminating
Company, of New York
City, installed a genera—
tor of 1200 lumps cap-
acity. then considered
a giant. By continuous
cxperimemntionundrc-
search the General
Electric Company has
developed generators
900 times as powerful
as this wonder of forty
years ago.

“What’s the use of it?”

Michael Faraday saw the real beginning
of the age of electricity nearly a century
ago when he thrust a bar magnet into a
coil of wire connected with a galvanometer
and made the needle swing.

Gladstone, watching Faraday at work in
his laboratory, asked, “What’s the use of
it?” The experimenter jestingly replied,
“There is every probability that you will
soon be able to tax it.” The world-wide use
of electricity that has followed the Faraday
discovery abundantly justiﬁes the retort
to Gladstone.

Faraday’s theory of lines of force is con-
stantly applied in the Research Laboratories
of the General Electric Company in de-
vising new electrical apparatus of'which
Faraday never dreamed. Every generator
and motor is an elaboration of the simple
instruments with which he ﬁrst discovered
and explained induction.
