ETERNAL YOUTH

Most of them lie smashed to bits
by now. If not. the ones that are
still intact and in active service are
probably losingi their strength and
desire to grow into well trained ha-
bits. And why not? Is it not the
eleventh day after the one on whicn
the resolutions were made? Who
could expect to keep a group of un-
ruly resolutions in good form for
eleven whole days? They grow old
and feeble. i

Why not play a joke on thean
tho"! Pretend. yes. pretend that
every night is a new year’s eye. that
every tomorrow is the beginning of a
new year. Make them believe they
are always only a day young and
watch them grow.

THE CROWD

A crowd is an animal, easily influ-
enced and swayed from one opinion
to another by elemental and emotion-
al appeals to the instincts. The rea-
son and judgment of a crowd is not
the reason and judgment of the
people composing it. Not only has
psychology proved this, but also in-
dividual experience.

The student body in assembly is
a crowd with a nervous system pecu-
liar to it but not to any few individu-
als in it. Any proposition presented
to such a body must ﬁrst be reacted
to by it divided into separate parts,
that is. by each member before that
proposition can be successfully sup-
ported by each student when away
from the crowd inﬂuence. Unless the
opportunity is given for individual
thinking over of the honor system as
proposed, no satisfactory result will
be possible, for college is a crowd on
Friday morning—s only.

At the present time the
Sophomore class has ﬁfteen
freshmen toques which have not
been disposed of. .,he wear-
ing of toques by the fresh-
men is a college tradition and
as such will be enforced. Un-

 

 

less these toques are purchased
at once other measures will be
takcn to enforce the ruling.‘
