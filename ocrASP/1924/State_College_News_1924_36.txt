SYSTEM OF DISCUSSION
GROUPS PLANNED TO
STIMULATE THINKING

Did you ever attend a discussion
group? Would you like to‘.’ Do you
knew what they are [01"!

The Student Council is arranging
for a series ol.‘ groups here at State
College before Easter. A discussion
group, il‘ well carried on. docs sever—
al things: ﬁrst, it strives to stimulate
individual thinking; second, it "as—
sumes the right of the rank and lile
of .i'ulks to think and decide for them-
selves"; third. it brings about group
thinking; fourth. it creates an atmos-
phere of good-fellowship and co-op-
oration.

A great deal of the success of dis-
cussion groups depends upon the
chairman. A group of capable upper-
classmen with keen intelligence will
probably be necessary. Under the
direction of Miss Rice. 21 group con-
sisting of Alice Daly, Margaret Eaton,
Mildred Kuhn. Elizabeth Nagle, Je-
rome Walker, Forrest Caton, Florence
Grecnblath, and Hilda Licbech, is
pursuing a course in “The Chairman’s
Method and Procedure." Their work
almost insures success.

The subjects have not been dis-
closed Lip to this time, but they will
be vital questions. near to'college
life, and requiring solution.

In a daring eil‘ort to register a vio-
tory in the last game of the ill-fated
1924 basketball season. State allowed
its defense to weaken in the last few
minutes of playing in order that all
players might be freer to score. and
sull’ered the consetiuchcs—«lefeot at
the hands of St. Stephen’s last Sat-
urday night on the home court.

The hair-raising character of the
game might be told in mere ﬁgures.
27 to 23, which spelled the second
defeat of the season by the Annap-
dule team. State lost the initial con-
test at Annnndale by a margin of two
points in the ﬁnal score. This marks
the third straight season that State's
traditional rivals have cleaned up in
the annual basketball competions.

State led a terriﬁc pace in the llrst
half. but the Purple and Gold clad
net shooters were unable to put the
sphere through the basket as often
as their opponents. Both teams Were
weak in foul shooting and nearest!"
the game was decided on ﬂeldscores.

Trailing a 20 to 13 score-“tor. the
ﬁrst half of the contest, State. came
back in the second period more de-
termined than ever to win. With the
score mounting higher. State gained
in determination. until after a quick
succession of field Heals. Coach Weg‘
ner's charges found themselves within
a few points of the leaders. .

St. Stephen's had been ﬁghting to
hold the Albanians. but the Purple
and Gold ﬁve was outplaying its rival.
’I‘he Rectors were trying: to get their
passing game to work. but the tossers
were broken up by State. Richey,
the star of the game. was making
some headway against State, but was

,handicapped by the failure of his

teammates to assist him at the critical
moments.

BISHOP PAUL JONES
GAVE INSPIRING TALK
ON GOOD WILL FRIDAY

Doctor Corning. a trustee of State,
was presented at the student assem-
bly Friday. March '7. and introduced
to the student body Bishop Jones
whose message was the spreading of
Good Fellowship throughout the en-
tire world.

Bishop Jones stated clearly and
emphatically that the only hope of
reaching people needing- help and
encouragement was by getting them
to accept a christian point of view,
a spirit of Fellowship in the place of
the hatred now so dominant. We
must have moral order in the Uni-

erse. but our only hope of bringing

.his about is by drawing men to us
not by compelling them but rather
by leading them to accept our ideas
and doctrines. Bishop Jones said:
“In a world of hatred one thing is
needed: a spirit of Good-Will."

President Brubacher presented to
the body of future teachers the effec-
tive manner in which these ideas of
Fellowship might be carried into the
school and classroom by the teacher
thereby making {or a better spirit of
understanding between instructor and

pupil.
