AN OPPORTUNITY

Student Council is trying to inst!-
tute a plan whereby the students may
gather in small groups to discuss stu-
dent aﬂ‘airs and problems. if thesa
groups can be successfully carried on
they will undoubtedly become a vital
part of college life.

As it now is, the only places where
small groups of students can exchange
ideas are sorority and fraternity
houses which comprise u small part
of the student body. Just as most
other enterprises put on in the college
are for the college, so are these dis-

‘ cussion groups which will have all the
other enterprises put on in the college
minus the disadvantages of size.

BASEBALL 'IO REPLACE
COURT GAME WITH
WINNING PRO§PECTS

Spring being but a few days hence,
State's baseball team has pitched
camp for training. sportively speak-
ing. and candidates are buckling
down to good hard work preparatory
to what promises to be one of the
rosiest diamond seasons in recent
years.

This year, State is especially gifted
with the talent of a coach who is no
second-rater when it comes down to
playing America’s national sport.
Fritz Wegner enjoyed an enviable
record at Cornell during his under-
graduate years and created for him-
self a niche in the Ithaca Hall 0'
Baseball Fame. He has his varsity
“C.”

But what is even still more pleas-
ing to followers of State’s baseball
destinies than the fact that chncr
has ability to coach, is the fact that
he will play with the team. Being
a graduate student. Coach Wagner is
entitled to playing privileges in cer-
tain college games. All the colleges
State will play this season, however.
do not permit graduate students in
their playing rosters; these will be the
only games in which Coach Wegncr
will be dcbarred from participating.
There are only two or three such con-
tests in the schedule.

The coach's favorite pesition is be-
hind the plate, and those who at—
tended last summer's league games
at Ridgcﬁeld park will testify as to
his qualifications. State ﬁnished sec-
ond in the city inter-club league, los-
ing the decisive game by a fluke, and
then came back and defeated the
champions in a post—season contest.

Captain Stahlman is particularly
pleased with the promising outlook.
More than twenty men are out to
compete for berths and there are in«
dications of several battles royal for
varsity positions. A few of the old-
timcers. who thought they had their
berths all sewed up this season, have
awakened to the astonishing really -
tion that the new material is (langu—
ous. .
For the last few weeks the battery
men have been working in the gym.
Although the basketball season pre‘
vented him from hurling the little pill
much before last Monday. Caton is
declared by many to be the brilliant
spot in State’s list of twirlers. Don-
nolly is a polished pitcher and will
umloubtedly land a second varsity
berth. Gainer and LeBarron are g0-
ing to contest for the honor of doing
mound duty. Both have plenty of
speed and curves, but lack control.
But that quality does not come at the'
beginning of the season, and there
is considerable possibility each ol’ the
two aspirants will be doing their bit
before the season is over.

Some ﬁrst-rate college teams are
scheduled for home games. to be
played at liidgeﬁeld park. These in-
clude Colgate and St. Stephen's. State
usually does to these teams in base-
yballll what they do to State in basket-
lﬂ .

Bygones be bygones in basketball.
the season is now ripe for rooting in
baseball.

FRESHMEN APPOINTED
TO (TO-OPERATE WITH
‘ DEAN PIERCE’S PLANS
A committee was chosen. Thurs-
dav. March (5, in freshman lecture.
to take over the half hour every week
in co-operation with Dean Pierce:
Louisi- Gunn. chairinan,~ Constance

   

Wesson:

“My. girls. I’m glad I came.
at all the songs Edna Shufer is going

Look

to sing.” “Wasn’t it dear of Tom-
my‘s sister to come up from New
York to play for us?” “Say. State
College’s John McCormack appears on
the program. In two Irish songs. too.
That certainly will be good.” Such
remarks as these floated over the au-
dience gathered in Chancellor’s Hall
Friday, March 7. at the opening of
the musical program directed by Pro-
fessor Thompson and Mr. Candlyn,
who were aided in making the enter-
tainment a success by Miss Helen
’l‘hompson. assisting artist. Both the
orchestra and the chorus made their
annual spring débute at that time,
but with more gusto and greater up~
plause than usual this season. The
scene. a brightly lighted hall, pretty
girls in evening dress. men in stin’ly-
stm'clied fronts—so the visual as well
as the auditory sense was appealed to.
Soon all consciousness of faces and
gowns was lost. All interest was com
tcrcd on the varied program.

The College sing by a College chor-
us. always a popular number. lost
none of its reputation Friday night.
"0 don’t you Remember.” a now
Prom song, seemed to especially
arouse the humor of the :lutliuncu,
n‘iany ol." whom. as was apparent. had
exporicncml the same ti'Olll)h‘s-~—Dl'0~
vidcd the last verse and the clever
little Wedding march neon-nipanimcnr
ut the close are not included in the
experience. The ducts. by Zelma
German and Edna Similar, by no
means fell short of people’s expecta-
tion. “The Rosary” seemed to be
particularly enjoyed. One might
have thought the render-pr of “i‘xlolly
Brannigun” and “Kitty O’Toole" had
been crossed in love. such pathos
crept into his Irish ballads. The en-
thusiasm displayed over Edna Sha-
l'er’s name on any College program
speaks for itself. while the Swedish
Folk songs and lthe cantata, “’l‘lu:
Slave’s Dream” won much applause.

The work of one skilled in her art
needs no comments. only a vote of
thanks is given Miss 'l'hompson
through the News for her kindness
gin making Friday night one of real
{pleasure to the College students. In
‘spitu of losing his baton. Professor
Thompson ably led the singing. Both
he and Professor Candlyn are to be
congratulated in “bringing; the lights
from under their bushels and making
them gleam."

GIRLS TEAM ENTERTAINED
GUESTS AT GYM. TEA

Dean Pierce and Dr.Croasclale Poured

 

In recognition of their prowess and
In appreciation of their service, the
varsity teams of State and Russell
Sage, together with their coaches and

Croasdalo poured. The informal oc-
casion served to cement the friendly
relations established between the
squads during the contest.

ell earned credit is due Muriel
llaggett, ’24, who had charge of the
function and deserved commendation
should be given the members of the
'l'reshmun basketball squad who ren-
dered perfect service.
