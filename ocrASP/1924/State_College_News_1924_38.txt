Dr. Croudnie Root. for State

‘The State routers while having the
pep could not compete with the Sage
student body in the variety and suit-
ability of songs. However, Dr. Creas-
dale featured for State—«you should
have seen her pirouette on one foot!

Liebech Put On! For Fouling

In the beginning of the second half
State sull‘ered her heaviest loss: Lie-
bcch out for fouling. Without her
pivot, the State squad attempted on
individual game. Russell Sage took
cognizance of this and now familiar
with the floor staged a. comeback.
After the loss of Liehech, Jones,
Sage center secured the “tap—oil'” and
Whitney for Sage demonstrated her
prowess at basket shooting. After
Heinemann’s removal for an aggre-
gate oi' fouls, the Russell Sage score
steadily mounted, although Hutchins
cut circles around her guard and
Holding went all the lloor at least
three feet in every jump.

Min Johnson Given Credit for

Fine Team

State may justly cherish the mem-
ory ol.‘ the machine Miss Johnson
shaped. ’l'hey played as a unit and
were uniformly excellent. Both tennis
exhibited the same b 'and of clean
playing and good sportsmanship.
Whitney, left forward, was the indi—
vidual star for Sage, while Liebeeh,
.l-leinemann, and (.‘raddoek featured
for State. Another game is [minding
at which State may again cheer on
her winning team.

Professor i-iustings in his English iii
class—«“When I was a little boy and
my mother took me shopping, and
sat me down on one of the chairs, 1
used to amuse myself by counting the
number of ladies who passed by the
mirror and didn’t look in the glass.”

A song for Professor 'l‘hompson,
when he broke his stick leading the

 

chorus: l
stick gone?
When its top broke short

And its [light grew long
0b. where, oh where. has it garnet"

 

the 'cst of. the year.

NE GRO 5 AND GROWS
"Grab a sandwich for me. w1
yuh?" Ouch! That soup’s hot!”
"Shove along there. I want a salad.”
The class in H. E. 14, assisting in the
Cafeteria this term, is tempted each
noon to sink down behind the lunch
counter, hoist the white ﬂag, and al-
low the terrifying epithets of the
hungry horde to pass lightly over its
head. Miss Thompson vouches for
the insistence of State’s brain work-
ers and remarks that the patronage
of the “Cafe” has increased consid-
r: 'any this term. Between three hun-
drcd fifty and four hundred people
are being served daily. State College
may rightfully be proud of the ﬁne
standard the Cafeteria sets for the

Home Economics Department.
