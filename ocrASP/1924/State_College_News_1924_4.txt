VARSITY OUT PLAYED
ALUMNI IN BOTH
GAME

With the Russell Sage game in
mind. and the need for seasoned ma~
tcrial for next year’s squad, Miss
Johnson, coach of the girls’ basket—
ball team, tried out new players and
diil‘erent combinations in the Alumni
came before vacation, which ended
in a 2(i~l.‘i score in i'avor of this
varsity.

Score 24—13

While not a great victory from a
purely athletic standpoint, considcr~
inp: the lack of training of the oppo~
sition, the overwhelming defeat ol’
the Alumni by State‘s varsity basket~
ball team was a great moral victory
and better days on the basketball
court may be expected.

FOR DISTINGUISHED

SERVICE WELL RE-
CEIVED BY STUDENTS
Again the Advanced Dramatics
class has been successful in present-
ing a one act pla The play, "For
Distinguished Service." in itself was
simple and light without much char~
actor, but it was pleasingly presented
before a large audience. Betty Naglc
played the part of the modern mar-
ried woman to life and Edna Shaef-
for, who represented the more old-
fashioned type of woman, acted her
role with character. Priscilla Jones
made a very typical maid. Miss Mar-
gery Bayless deserves note as director ‘
of the play.

° FRENCH CLUB TEA FOR 

 

But nobody had
thought to do it

By bringing electricity down from the clouds
over a kite string, it was a simple thing
to prove that lightning was nothing more
than a tremendous electrical ﬂash.

BENJAMIN FRANKLIN
"06-1790

Primer, journalist. diplomat.
inventor, statesman, philoso-
pher,wit. Ono ofthoauthorsof'
the Declaration of Independ-
ence and the Constitution,
author of Poor Richard's Al-
manack; and one of the most
eminent natural philosophers
of his time.

For centuries before Franklin ﬂew his kite
in 1751 philosophers had been speculating
about the nature of lightning. With elec-
triﬁed globes and charged bottles, others had
evolved the theory that the puny sparks of
the laboratory and the stupendous phenom-
enon of the heavens were related; but
Franklin substituted fact for theory—by
scientiﬁc experiment.

Roaring electrical discharges, man-made
lightning as deadly as that from the clouds,
are now produced by scientists in the Re-
search Laboratories of the General Electric
Company. They are part of experiments
which are making it possible to use the
power of mountain torrents farther and far-
ther from the great industrial centers.

Electrical machines
bearing the mark of the
General Electric Com—
pany, in use throughout
the world, are raising
standards of living by
doing the work of mil-
lions of men.
