MOTHER ANT) DAUGHTER
WEEK-END TO BE DI-
RECTED BY Y. w. c. A.

Another novel social event is lak—
ing form under Y. W. auspices, a
Mother and Daughter Week~eiid. Ii‘or-
merly, college students planned to
"show their talk» around" on Moving‘
Up-Day, but now that crowded con‘
dltions, which make uncertain the
comfort of even the immediate stu-
dent body, will not admit visitors, a
new plan for entertaining must be
formulated. P‘urther particulars will
be given later. In the mi-(lfitil‘lll' tact-
l‘ully suggest to your mother that she
is eager to visit college, and that spe—
cial arrangements are being made to
make the visit most enjoyable.

going to do about it?" Dr. IIornor
answered the question by saying that
We were going; to keep right on mak-
