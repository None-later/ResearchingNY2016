“THE BOOR" GAVE
VA‘LUABLE SUGGESTIONS
TO YOUNG LOVERS

Girls, when all other means fail,
you might try having him teach you
to shoot a pistol. This is a sue-ges-
tion ofTered by “The Boar." presented
Tuesday evening. March 11. by the
Advanced Dramatic Class. under the
direction of. Mrs. Ravmer. The ine-
thod worked splendidly when used by
I’IJIC‘H Orr. as the beautiful Helena

 

lvanovna Pupor. on Icrocious Grigori ‘
Stcpanovitch Smivnov. played by Ed-
ward Vines. Dark eyes used at close
range proved it more eil’cctive weapon
than the pistol and the “Boer” be-
came as. tempestuous in his love mak-
ing: as he had been in bill-collecting,
but with better success.

Very important as a background
for this stormy love affair was Luka.
the tremblinp.‘ old servant, played by
Margaret Eaton. And we must not
forget the real Russian music though
it was so soon over. Truly. Russian
comedy was a great treat for State
College.

WHAT TO WEAR AND
HOW TO WEAR IT

Miss Helm of the Home Economics
department on ’l‘hursday. March iii.
in [i‘i’esl'imen lecture declared that in
selectingr clothes four things are to
he considered: ii) the need. (2) the
occasion. (3) the color. (4) the indi-
vidual.

 

Bright Colors For Spring
I“il‘si‘. of all. in connection with the

color of n garment. three thing's must .

be taken into consideration, (I) the
s'rason. (2) the occasion. ill) the in-
dividual. In the sprint" and summer
bright colors are most ell’cctive.

Tyne An Important Factor

 

Particular care. Miss Keim said“
must be paid to the type of individual "
one irav he. l'lmphasis must be placed .
upon (l) the color of the eyes. (2) 

.the color of the hair. (3) the com-

plexion. (Ill the figure. Here. Miss
Keim gave a little key way to select
becoming- clothes; if one selects a
dress that is the color of one’s eyes,
it is most certain to he eil'ective. Then
as to the figure; the stout ﬁgure
should striw for long: lines. up and
down. also no brilliant colors. The
tall. thin individual should use intense
colors, cross lines. circular ilounces.
and tucks. The short. stout person
must have long: lines, and color in
the way of buttons.

All those going to Soirée will be
interested to know that chiil‘on is the!
thing: this year for evening wear.
Also a irreat many of the summer
clothes are tailored. Black aml white
ell‘ects are the latest fashion hint.

Now what person in State College
can not look beautiful?
