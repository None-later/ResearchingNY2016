MISS PERINE GAVE COLOR
LECTURE TO FRESHMEN

Have you ever noticed how Nature
mixes her colors. in what way she
produces the greatest harmony in her
children? Miss Pcrine, in freshmen
lecture, March 25, demonstrated how
Nature is the best model after which
to fashion our color schemes.

In spring the colors are light and
dainty, the light green of the leaves,
and the delicate hues of the blossoms.
As summer comes on the colors grow
darker of a richer, deeper tint, until
in the autumn they are very dark,
and coming winter robs them of their
glory. It is indeed very true that
everything in Nature is full of color.

There are three principle colors
(1) yellow, that color which is near-
est sunshinc, (2) red, (3) blue. The
“warm colors are yellow, red, and or-
ange and the cold colors are green,
blue, and purple.

ANNIVERSARY “STEAL”
ATTEMPTED BY THE
FRESHMEN AT SOIREE

Bribery Played Biz Purl In
Averled Traaedy

Failure of the freshmen to re-cnact
the now famous drama entitled. “The
Flight of the Sophomore Banner fi’om
the Soiree.” ﬁrst portrayed at State
College by the class of 1.025 two
years ago, has brought to light during
the last week sensational details of
an attempted bribe.

Should the bribe have been accept-
ed and the same details. as are now
known, leaked out, the New York
State I,.egislature would have had a
little ’I‘eapot Dome party all of its
own. liecatme of the source from
which the details have been learned
concerning the bribe off“ made by a
“high ollicial” of the f nnan class,
all the facts of the case cannot be
divulged.

A plea of self-incrimination having
been taken by the author of this hor-
rifying expose, it is necessary first
that it be known that on Friday night,
one week ago. the sophomore Soiree
took place in the gymnasium. A few
hours before the start of that social
affair, a “special” meeting of the
-freshmen was held secretly, having
been called by President Comstock.

It' all the minutes of this meeting
Were available for publication. it
would send the Senate oil probers into
three fits. The [acts are known. but
they are not to be told. outside of
the fact that it was at the meeting
that bribe plans were conceived.

The essence of the case is that a
ceItain member of. the freshman class
ofl‘ered Leo Coleman “any sum he
might name” to stay away from the
gymnasium when it was about time
lfor the soiree to break up. ndei
"such conditions, it was foreseen, the
attempt to "steal" the soph banner
might have succeeded. But the. mighty
Leo wasn‘t desirous of having his
name added to the political embrog-
lio. and consequently. the sophomore
banner is now back where it has been
for some months.

Mysterious whispers, much hand—
shaking and quiet little ripples of
laughter every now and thenl Un-
derclassmen at State suddenly sat up
and utilized the gray matter last
week. What was it all about? Senior
appointments, of course. The class
of ’24 is preparing to leave the home
nest, and everyone watches with in-
tercst the start of the flight. Many
appointments from the various de-
partments have been made. From
the Commercial side of the house,
Professor York announces the ap-
pointment of Marie Millet for a po-
sition in Millbrook, New York, and
Maren 'I‘odd in Cobleskill, New York.

DR. BRUBACHER TO PRE-

900,000 DOLLAR APPRO-
PRIATION TO BE GIVEN
T 0 THE COLLEGE BUIL-

ING FUNI)

Slate Legillatura Expected To Fall
On Building Fun

An appropriation of $900,000 is to
be included in the general appropria-
tion bill of the state for the erection
of an addition to State College, Sen-
ator William ’I‘. Byrne of bany,
author of the Milne hall plan, has
assured President Brubacher.

The Senate ﬁnance committee and
the Assembly ways and means com-
mittee are busy formulating the gen-
eral budget, which will be adopted
next week, just before the end of
the 1924 session of the legislature.
It is said with some authority at the
Capitol that the State College appro-
priation will be given a preferred

‘place on the budget.

Although the state budget this year
is to be higher than last year, it is
not believed the legislature will prune
any of the expenditures for educa-
tional purposes. as the development
of the state’s school system is one of
Governor Smith’s pet projects.

The inclusion of the college appro-
priation in the general bill to be
passed by both houses will start the
ball rolling for the realization of Dr.
Brubacher’s plans to make State Col»
lege rank as a leader in teacher
training. The addition of a science
building, to be known as Milne ball.
will allow a registration of close to
1.200 students each year. it is ﬁgured.
