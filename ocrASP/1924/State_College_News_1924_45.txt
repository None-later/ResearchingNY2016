A FRESHMAN'S WAIL

The freshman class has been in-
formed by the authorities that it may
have no spring dance. “It is a col-
lege tradition that the freshman class
has no social function," they are told.
We have noticed that in the past col-
lege traditions have been revised with
very little dilliculty. Also, the class
of ’27 is the lamest that has yet
graced State’s halls. and therefore is
leaving more with the college than
has any previous class. Should not
the class doim: more for the college
receive a little extra consideration?

 

 

 

 

 

 

To the Freshmen Who We": ‘

Would you be very very happy if)
you could do everything in the world‘
that you wanted to do; if you hath
everything just as you liked it, ai-i
ways? Would you be happy in a!
world or even a. suction of a world
where there was nothing; to look for-
ward to. nothinu‘ to leave a bit better
than you found it‘.’

Would you really be happy here
at College. if you could do just whatl
you wanted to do just when youi
wanted to do it?

What would be the use or fun of
being a senior if you had enjoyed all
the senior privileues during: your
freshman year?

Please. please, think a bit toward
the year 1927 and of the two inter—
vening years. And in thinking of
the seniors who seem to hold you in
strict repression. think of the time
when they too were only freshmen.
when they too wanted to do thing's
which were not permitted. Will you
take the advice of a senior who has
run the race from repression to free-
dom and dignity; will you look at
your fellows with a bit more under-
standing and remember that life cv-
erywhcro is worthwhile only when
you “live and let live?"

THIRTY-SEVEN GIRLS

Alas! when we look at the few of
our number who have withstood the
desire to have their‘ hair left in some
convenient barber shop with the sign
"Hair Bobbing; a Specialty." Thirty-
sevcn of our number have been
tempted and have not been able to
withstand. As a result we have a
few more girlish looking maidens go-
ing forth to teach our future citi—
zens. As a consolation we can yet
say. “Yes, we have a few old-fash-
ioned girls left.” But for how long?

MAN T0 MAN

There is one thine: we want at
State and that is more men. We
not only want them; we need them.
Certainly, not all men want to be
teachers, but there is a reasonably
large number who every year, are
turning to this profession. Why not
get them for State? You men who
are here. put it up good and strong-
to them. Show them that State has
something to offer.

Athletics have a good start, keep
them going. Good teams put a col-
leu'e on the map quicker than any
other activity. We want S. C. T. to
have her place. ﬁrm and secure.

Men here's your chance. When
you knock 011‘ work for the spring
vacation and later for the summer.
talk State, and talk it as if you knew
what you were saying: and meant it.
Get men here at State. Perhaps even
the women would welcome a few
more to relieve the present one-sided
ratio. ’26.

NEWMAN NOTES

Conception members of the Newman
Club from Troy, Schenectady, and
Albany attended High Mass on Sun-
day, March 23. Bishop Gibbons of
Albany gave the sermon. A Quarter-
ly Communion of Newman Club will

Ralph Beaver has received a cook-
book from one of the large manu-
facturing: concerns. We wonder what
subjects Ralph intends to teach next
year? Can it be Domestic Science?

Did you know that your success
for the year is measured by the dis
tance you see your ﬁrst robin from
the around? Make sure your robin
is in the clouds and not on the
ground.

It appears that Minerva needs me-
dical care and moral guiding. She
stands in her accustomed place but
between her lips she still retains the
end of a cigarette and as she has
never smoked before and didn’t know
when to stop she burned severely her
nose and mouth. Will she be ex-
pulled?
SCULPTOR FASCINATED
STUDENTS WITH SKILL
AND CLEVER REMARKS

To those whose privilege it was to
hear the lecture given by Mr. Lorado
Taft at Chancellor’s hall Tuesday
evening, March 25, little need be said
as to its real worth; to those who
were not present We can only hope
to give a glimpse of the value and
enjoyment of beine‘ given an oppor—
tunity to see something- of the real
life of a sculptor.

Mr. ’l'ui't’s first aim was to give an
elementary knowledge of the human
body and its relation to his art. His
next was to show by use of various
models the manner 0!? expression and
the methods employed to produce it
in the ﬁeld of sculpture.

In the person of Mr. ’l‘nl't was pros-
ent not only the genius but :1 won-
derful and congenial personality as
well. He made an instant appeal to
the entire audience not only to those
interested in this phase of art but
to all interested in the beautiful
things of life. His various models
were taken from life and presented
in a manner which made the lecture
more than the moulding of clay; it
showed that Mr. Taft was heart and
soul in his work and wished to impart
to others a little of the zeal which he
felt.

The Dramatic and Art Association
deserves much credit for having so-
cured such an artist as Mr. Taft to
come before the students of the col«
logo and those interested in art to
give them a deeper and truer under-
standing of that great art, sculpture.
