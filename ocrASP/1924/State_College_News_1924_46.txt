comet has been the
world's electrical devel-
opment. By continuous
scientiﬁc research the
General Electric Com-

the industry.

STATE COLLEGE NEWS,

The comet came back

The great comet that was seen by William
of Normandy returned to our skies in 1910
on its eleventh visit since the Conquest.
Astronomers knew when it would appear,
and the exact spot in the sky where it
would ﬁrst be visible.

Edmund Halley’s mathematical calcula-
tion of the great orbit of this 76~year vis-
itor—his scientiﬁc proof that comets are
part of our solar system—was a brilliant
application of the then unpublished Prin-
cipia of his friend Sir Isaac Newton.

The laws of motion that Newton and
Halley proved to govern the movements
of a comet are used by scientists in the
Research Laboratories of the General Elec-
tric Company to determine the orbit of
electrons in vacuum tubes.

CLASSICAL CLUB HEARD
HUMOROUS TALE OF WOE
OF LATIN TEACHERS’ FATE

"Bubbles, bubbles, who has trou-
bles?” The Latin school ma’am, of
course, as proved by Alice Sisaon at
a recent meeting of the classical club,
held Wednesday, March 19. In a hu-
morous article composed by Mills Sis—
son. the terrible struggles of a Latin
school master of the past and a Latin
school teacher of the present were
amusingly depicted. Members of the
Club lung'th in the very face of such
dimcultios and lustin entcrod into
the singing- of Latin song's. An en-
joynbln half hour was passed by all
in spitc ol‘ the cloud of financial em«
barrasmont which overhangs the as-
sociation. It may yet pay its bill to
the pcrlaa'ogzuc board by means of the
drive for dues and the calm Hale hold
this week.
