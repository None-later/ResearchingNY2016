MISS PERINE GAVE COLOR
' LECTURE T0 FRESHMEN

(Continued from page 1)

Show: Violet Oakley Book

Miss Perine shoch the freshmen a
very interesting book called “The
Holy Experiment" by Miss Violet
Oakley. This book tells, in beauti-
fully colored pictures, and interest-
ing printing, the story of William
Penn. Miss Oakley is a descendant
of the Quakers. and she has narrated
their story in a most sympathetic
manner.

There are only ﬁve hundred copies
in the world of this great book. State
College has the only one in this part
of New York State. The book has
been exhibited in the Education
Building.

 

CHANGES IN NEW
CATALOGUES

Reduction of the number of re-
quired hours in major subjects and a
proportionate increase in the number
of elective hours will be noticeable in
the 1924-25 catalogues, it is an-
nounced by Dr. Brubncher. The ca-
talogues will probably be ready for
distribution in about a month.

The change in the system of re-
quired subjects for majors is based
upon the practice in other colleges
and universities, which has been
steadily gaining in favor throughout
the United States. That practice is
to allow wider choice in the selection
of courses in which a student is spe-
cializing. The selection will be based
thereby more on the personal sensi-
bilities of the student. than on the
faculty.

The change to go into effect at
State next September will also ail’ecl.
not to as great degree as majors.
Notable reductions in the number of
required subjects will be marked in
the science departments, chieﬂy Phy-
sics and Chemistry.

Another feature of the new cata-
logues will be regarded in the mas-
ter's requirements. Holders of bach-
elor's degrees from other institutions,
who work for their master’s degree
at State College, will not be required
to take as many courses in Educa<
tion as heretofore. providing they
have bad the requirement for their
bachelor’s decree. similar to the re-
quirement at State. This new sys-
tem, Dr. Brubacher avers, will allow
graduate students to pursue more
courses in their special subject.

KEEP HAPPY AND
HEALTHY lN ORDER TO
ENJOY LIFE

Dr. (Jroasdaie states. “that to keep
the mind and body equally balanced
lS essential for every student in order
to have a successful college career."
The physical status of State College
is improvinr; year by year. The stu-
dent's piiysical'health comes above or
before college work. but that does
not mean that the student must no-
glect his studies.” We must remem-
ber that a sound mind and a sound
body is tested by its ability to act
in a crisis. Let every student try to
maintain the happy medium, and
State College will send forth stronger,
better types of individuals into the
world.
