APPROVAL OF
STUDENTS

Pictures in be. changed in relays

 

During the tea dance last Saturday
remarks were made upon the oppor-
tune coming“ of the art exhibit which
is on display in the lower ball and
rotunda. “What a treat it is“ one
exclaimed, addine‘ that she preferred
the nature pietures—“plenty of trees
with blue sky showing through."
Many admired the scene of the mouse
in black silhouette against a sunset
sky. The very unconventionality of
the lines of the picture. fitting to the
subject, attracts. Maxlield l’nrisb‘s
“Davbreak” has been a center of at-
tention. A member of the students
have delighted in “The Home of the
Heron.” and to many a throng of
pleasant associations have been re-
called by the old farmhouse. hall' hid-
den by apple blossoms. Numbers of.
favorite pictures might be named: the
angel with ﬂaming: sword, the delight:
fully‘ imaginatiive representation of
mischievous, cross-leaped l‘an. charnr
in}: to him by soft music and coy
glance little living: creatures, “In the
Garden,” the “picture of curves" as
one student called it~---but one cannot
name them all; personal taste Varies
greatly. To give a professor’s fren-
eral jluia'ment, "The exhibition in my
opinion surpasses last year’s in that
it is a truer representation of life
with less “slap-dash” application of
paints for protesque ell'ects. Either
thr- new art is modifying its radical-
ism, or I am being unconscioust won
over to it. lllost ot‘ the pictures are
commendable in their expression ol‘
mood.”

Thanks and appreciation are due
the Dramatic and Art Council which
is in charge of the exhibition. The
pictures will be changed from time
to time. Watch for new ones.

Back to childhood days! The sad
den and mysterious appearance of a
long line of seats approximately a
foot high and guaranteed to hold the
largest child in the kindergarten
caused great excitement in State Col-
Ice‘c last week. Could they possibly
be bound for Milne High? Impos-
sible. those youngsters could never
ﬁt in those chairs! More and more
strange—next day they had reached
the second floor, and—did our eyes
deceive us?——they were soon being
installed in “Connie’s” holiest sanc-
tum~room 100. All day there was
a large gathering outside the door,

BRILLIANT PROSPECTS
FOR BASEBALL THIS
SEASON

Preparatory to the opening of the
baseball season shortly after the
spring; vacation, Coach Wcmier will
start next week to round his varsity
team into shape. The process of eli—
mination has already begun and the
major squad is steadily being- reduced
to the twelve of ﬁfteen men who will
make up the regular varsity roster.

Thorough outdoor practice will be
started in a few days and the subse-
quent scrub games will reveal the
brighter lights of the squad—those
who will eventualy land varsity posi-
tions, providing they can keep up the
pace. The last few weeks or so have
been spent in the rudiments of the
game and in getting the kinks out of
the stiff arms. The next ten days
will be devoted to the practical side
of the training.
