LIBRARY THOUGHTS

The large registration at State this
year makes the conditions of the li-
brary very congested. It also makes
the use of reference books. which are
in great demand, very dilllcult. We
as students could do much to remedy
this latter condition. When we take
books which are on reserve, we should
keep them only as long as we intend
to use them. Don’t take a book out
thinking that in lialf an hour or so
you may want it. Let the other fol--
low have an equal chance and be good
enough sport to take a chance your-
self. If we would all adopt this phi-
losophy it would be much easier to
ﬁnd the books on the reference shelf.
Don’t forget that others are waiting
to use the same books.

PROFESSOR RISLEY

According to letters received, Pro-
fessor Risley is at present enjoying
the delights of Nice on the Mediter-
ranean. He speaks of the foreigners
going about in white costumes. ﬂow-
ers everywhere, oranges and lemons
growing, tennis players, and a few
hardy souls in bathing. Prof. Risley
says he found Germany both rich and
poor, a few unusually well oil' but
much grinding poverty and depres-
sion. In regard to France he speaks
of preparation for war. The fron-
tiers of France facing Italy are well
fortiﬁed. The value of the franc has
risen from 14.24 to 24.50 to the dol-
lar since he come there.

Prof. Risley and his family will be
in Italy until after Easter, with Easter
at Rome. and then Censa, Pisa, Flor-
ence. Pompeii. Bologna. and perhaps
Padua and Verona. and either the
Austrian or Italian lakes on the way
to Switzerland will he visited.

Communication will ﬁnd Prof. Ris<
lay in curc‘of American Express 00..
Rome, Italy.'

STATE COLLEGE NEWS,

‘COLLEGE STUDENTS T0 CON-
DUCT SUMMER COLONY AT
WOODSTOCK. NEW YORK

Student at Bryn Mawr, Dartmouth,
Yule. Swurthmore. and Northwestern
will co-opcrate next summer in main-
taining an Intercollegiate Camp at
Woodstock, New York, July Isl; to
September 17th. These students have
assumed joint management of the
camp with a committee of The Na-
tional Student Forum which organized
the enterprise last summer. One hun-
dred ﬁfty students from colleges, uni-
versities and Labor Schools are ex-
pected to visit the camp during thc
summer. Twenty-live scholarships
are available to pay the expenses of
labor delegates.

The camp will give students the
opportunity to meet some of the load-
ers of American thought not only in
lectures, and discussion but in the
frank and free comradeship of the
open air. A number of educntm‘s,
churchmen, business men, labor lean-
ers, and sacial workers will visit the
camp during the summer. Among
those who are alreain expected are
Dr. Stephen P. Duggun, Director,
Institute of International Education,
Rev. John Haynes Holmes, Commu-
nity Church, New York, Professor
William Heard Kilputrick, Dept. of
Philosophy of Education, Teachers
College, Professor William Fielding
0gburn, Dept, of Economics and So-
ciology, Barnard College and Rabbi

New ork.

There will be live conference per-
iods of two weeks each beginning
July lst. during each of which the
camp committee will be limited to
forty students. Each conference will
consider, with individual differences,
international, industrial, racial, and
educational questions. The camp will
be equipme with a small theatre and
workshop in which students may on
occasion present one—act plays.
Woodstock, N. Y., is in the Catskill
Mountains, fourteen miles from King-V
ston. In addition to alluring hiking,
swimming, and possibly tennis, it is
a community which ali‘ords unusual
artistic and musical admiitugns. Ow-
ing to the limited accommodations of
the camp, delegates from any one col-
lege will number from four to eight.
Colleges desiring to send delegates
should apply immediately for quota
to The National Student Forum, 2.929
Broadway, New York City, recom-
mending at the time of application a
local student agency which will elect
or appoint delegates. Students may
rcgister from April [st to May lst
but only the ﬁrst 150 registrations
can be accepted.

Any registered student—delegate
may justiﬁably feel that he or she has
real prerogatives in determining the
activities, interests, and opportunities
of the particular conference con-
cerned. Criticisms and suggestions
regarding program, preferences as to
speakers and plays forwarded to the
organizing student committee will re-
ceive careful consideration and will
be followed so far as possible with
reference to the conference desired.
One of the most interesting fea-
tures of the camp is that it will grad-
ually come into the control of the
students who visit it. The most ox-
port advisers are helping to draft the
plans for making Woodstock a co-
operative enterprise with shnres in
the hands of the organizations rep:
resented there this summer. This
will be the first enterprise of the kind

‘THE RISING OF THE MOON’
REVEALED unOqu USED
BY S'l‘A'I'E'S MAID‘ENS

Brass buttons and an excellent
roguei A copper and un escaped
com/let sitting on the same barrel and
engaged in friendly conversation! A
reward for the ci‘lmlnal’s arrest nailed
to that sclfsume barrel! These were
some of the mujor attractions which
entered into the play “The Rising of
the Moon” presented in the Auditor~
iuin Wednesday, March 26, under the
direction of Beatrice Martin. Mildred
Kuhn and Helen: Borsick. as police-
man X and policeman U, twirled their
clubs and strode about the stage in
as olilcious a fashion as any member
on the Albany force. In spite of a
reward, in spite of her duty Edith
Higgins, us the police sergeant, let a
warm lrish heart follow its bent and
aided the criminal to escape.

Perhaps it was the singing of some
wierd old li'isli songs and the note of
athos in her deep voice which made
Edna Shufer such a lovable villian.
Whatever it was, this lovable villain
escaped with the assistance of the ser-
geant on dark waters lighted by a
rising moon. A dramatic ending in-
deed, and one presenting strange
paradoxes! K. i".

“WHERE BUT IN AMERICA"
PROVED TIME-OLD SAYING
ALL MEN ARE EQUAL

“Where but in America" would a
servant rule such a perfectly poised
Wife as Mrs. Espenhayne, Marion Far-

auyone ﬁnd such an ideally obedient
husband with a sense of humor as
Mr. Espuniiziync, Forrest Caton'!
“Where but in State College" could
one lind such a perfect representation
of a Swedish maid as was seen chd-
nesday, March 26. given by Dorothy
Benoit? Who could blame Mrs. itis-

husband’s pathetic vchIon of “Star
light, Star bright, will Hilda talk to
him all night?” or—blamc the audi-
ence for laughing? 0n the other
hand, what husband would not be
mystified at Mrs. l'lspcnhaync’s quick
and volublc change of conversation?
How has “Dot” Bonnit managed to
conceal her Swedish origin for four
years? Ask Aileen Wallace—she pro-
duced these three miracles.

HERTHA SPECHT LECTURES
FRESHMEN ON "FRIENDSHIP"
“Let's think about—-—Friends"
Let us stop for a moment in this
busy whirl of college life, and let us
think. About what? Friends. That
is what the freshmen did in freshman
lecture of March 27. when Hertha
Spoclit gave a talk on “Friendship”.
if one goes to the Bible. said Miss
Specht, there will be found the won-
drous friendship of David and Jona-
than. Aristotle said that friendship
was “one soul in two bodies.” As we
go on down through the ages there
is ’I‘ennyson’s immortal “In Memor-
iam.”
What In It

And from whence does It Come?
Today is considered a day of real-
ism, and friendship is considered to
be a sentimental subject. It is not

How to choose a friend
How can one choose a friend? it
is an established fact that friends
mould one’s character. A person is
known by the company he keeps.
When a person has a friend. things
are seen in a dili‘ercnt light, and from

CLASSICAL CLUB

The Classical club, as well as the
rest of the College clubs, has reaped
proﬁts from a cake and candy sale.
Over fourteen dollars was realized
by this organization Thursday, March
26, which proved the fondness of State
College students for sweet-meats. Ask

Mildred Hammerslcy how swiftly
they melted away under the on»
slaught. Evidently some of the inani-

ens here have at least one character-
istic in common with the comedy
character in “Daughters of Today"—
that of an insatiable appetite. The
men have long ago built up their re~
putation along this line.
