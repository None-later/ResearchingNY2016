TEA DANCE WELCOME
DIVERSION TO LONG
PERIOD OF STUDY

Dancing first lloor! Bridge and mail
jong second floor! All State College
men out and a few State College
maidens. Pretty afternoon gowns, and
an occasional “tux.” (loud music and
light refreshments! This may not
sound like a pleasing afternoon but
ask those who attended the tea-dance
held Saturday, March ll). An all‘ii'-
mative answer is gnarantcml. Mild
thirst was satiated by tea, poured in
the Green ltoom by Miss l"utterer and
Miss VanDenburgh, and in the lied
Room by Mildred Kuhn, liidna Shafer
and Mary Weiss, while dainty appe—
tites were satisfied by little cakes and
cookies. One little freshman was
heard to remark that she wished a tea
dance might be held ever Saturday.
Was it a success? Yes! Yes! Yes!

But who was responsible for this
wonderful event? Margaret Eaton,
Emily Belding, and Elizabeth Gib-
bons, of course. Didn’t you notice
how they hurried about in their efforts
to make everybody comfortable and
happy?

MATH. CLUB INSPECTS
THE SCHOOL OF PYTHAGORAS

Lively Initiation of Involved Proofs
and Intrinsic Debates

If you want to know just how
much you do know about mathema-
tics, come to a Math. Club initiation,
and try to answer some of the ques-
tions made out by those sages who
have been so Ion r under the influence
of “higher intel cuts” that they can
answer anything. If the initiates,
mainly those of Dr. Conwell’s brilliant
analytic class, knew what it was he
put up to them, probably not so many
would have made such a strenuous
effort to get there, that is, to make
their appearance in the college gym.

program consisting of a stunt, the
School of Pythagoras, a series of
character sketches and a most inter-
i-sting and witty debate. l-larvey Fen—
ner appeared at a very opportune
moment to prove a point for the neg-
ative side of the debate which con—
cerned those shining new seats in
Iioom IOO.

Dancing and refreshments were
next in order, and Dr. Ceiiwell who
appeared to be interested in watcn-
ing the dancers was gently asked by
one of the females if he would care
to dance (you know this is Leap
Year), but he as gently refused. The
party was, however, very suct ss
and the initiates seemed to wit .tani
the shock of being asked to state the

NEWMAN NOTES

During the past week Newman
.l-Iouse gave fifteen dollars to tho Dor-
mitory Fund as a result of their card
party. Also Newman: Club,_contri-
huted forty dollars as u result-of their
cake sale. March 17. If every club
comes over as big as Newman. tho
Dormitory Fund will certainly swell!

Perhaps it would be interesting to
students In banking to know that the
Dormitory funds are invested in six
banks in Albany giving 4 it per cent.
The quota has been ﬁlled in these
banks, and we are starting an ac-
count in the last bank in Albany
which yields 4 1/. per cent. Sums have
been invested in two banks which give

only 4 per cent.

An architect is drawing up plans
for dormitories which would fit two
available plots of ground within walk-
ing distance of the College. These

are. of course. only preliminary sets.

of sketches to discover what could
be built on these pieces of land as a
basis for estimating expensive build-
ing operation.
