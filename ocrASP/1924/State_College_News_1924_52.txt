BRILLIANT PROSPECTS

By the tilne of the first game, April
27 at Middlebury. Coach Weaner be-
lieves his battery men will be in the
pink of condition. especially if the
Weather continues warm. Caton is a
regular hot Weather twirler and he
will prormldy draw down all the un-
signments that come on favorable
days. Gninor and LeBnrron will be
able to take care of the contests on
cool days. Murphy can take the
mound almost anytime. Pitehlnp; is
the least of Conch Wouner's troubles.
This is one year that State can boast
of a strong battery. And under suen
a condition, the outfield doesn’t neces-
sarily have to be as perfect as when
the battery is weak. So, the major
cll'orts in trainng will from now on
be directed at the inﬁeld.

A grand array elf experienced in»
ﬁeld men are at Coach Wagner's bid-
ding and there is considerable com-
petition going on for varsity places.
Many ol’ those who were ﬁrst re-
garded as bench warmers have come
forth and have shown their true
wares. The New York Yankees‘ gal-
axy of high paid perl'ormt. won't
have anything on State, comparatively
speaking, if the enthusiasm continues
at its'prcsent rate.

Among the men who are trying rm

 

this year's team are: Captain Stain-i '
