“DREAMS OF STATE COL-
LEGE" PER DR. CROASDALE

Hemoglobin Tel!- Excite Great
Thronzo and Much Interest

 

Why such a throng passing thru to
Dr. Croasdale’soiﬁcc on last Friday?
Was the freshman class stricken with
a sudden sickness? No, only a great
curiosity to have Dr. Croasdale
"prick their'ﬁnger" or in scientiﬁc
language to' have their hemoglobin
tested by a hemoglobinometer. Eigh-
ty or eighty-ﬁve is the average per
cent for the College student, though
after a hard winter seventy-ﬁve per
cent is more general.

It would be great to have a class
or two in Advanch Hygiene. Of
course, a laboratory and a full time
assistant would be needed. That is
one of the' items in the good Lord’s
Book of Promise under the heading

 

of Dreams of State College.
