GREETINGS

The News wishes everyone a Happy
Easter vacation and hopes that every-
one will ﬁnd all the time he or she
wants for the enjoying, of all the
things there are to be enjoyed during.r
this vacation. _

DR. TliOth—‘SON

Dr. Harold W. Thompson has been
forced by strain from overwork to
leave college for the remainder of the
year. The absence of Dr. Thompson
means to the college more than the
absence of a professor of English anil
music: it means the loss of one of the
few professors who takes an active
and genuine interest in all things per-
taining to the college and student
body. Dr. Thompson came out for
every activity; fostered (New plan
for the growth of collcgolspirit and
sociability. He was the direct insti-
gator of the social committee which
is now doing such ﬁne work for the
students.

Not as a faculty member but as a
“best sport” and ﬁne loader does the
college miss Dr. Thompson, and hope
for his complete recovery.

BETTER CHANCES

The announcement of several new
courss to the curiculum for next
year bespcaks an advance in secon-
dary education. State College is what
might be called a conservative college.
Any progressive steps taken by it are
carefully estimated for their value
and suitability for the students. It
appears-that. due to the results ob-
tainedfronrhaving more elective and
fewer-required subjects. .studcnts
take
interest in their work. Many stu-
dents bank on the absence of rc~
quircd subjects. but a greater DCF
ccntago grow enthusiastic over the
fact that they may go the limit in
their chosen .ii-nartmeni.

If the stud-nits are satisﬁed their
standard 01' work will be higher. A
higher standard for the college will
he the result, and an advance step in
education will be the term applied to
the result. which is most desirable.

‘ STATE COLLEGE NEWS,

DISC USSION GROUPS

The student discussion groups held
last week at the different sorority
houses showed plainly one thing: the

 

students are willing, but the-aren’t,

just sure and are tcrcfore some-
what bashful. What those. groups

need is it hit more time to growra .

bit more care and encouragement; a
bit more attractive publicity and a
lot of boosting. There is nothing
wrong with them or with the students
who don't nitond them. There is no
trouble: the situation needs construc-
tive cooperation of the college. They
will succeed and will amount to some-
thing it given the right chance.

STUDENT OPINION
MINERVA

Don’t you think Minerva should be
attended to? Doesn’t Minerva stand
to Stat..- Colliige as the flag does to
our counti‘y‘.’ Must Minerva. the
Goddess of Wisdom. the ideal of State
College, 'stand there in an obscure
corner with discolored lips, dirty. and
with broken lingers? 'l‘ho treatment
of Minerva is shameful; the stub of
a cigarette to mock her iips and dust
to gather upon her. Would we treat

the “Stars and Stripes" like that?

AssEMva A CLASS

Is it right for students to got up
and leave assembly at will? Isn't it
just Ill“) getting up and leaving a
class room if you» happonod to be
rotting bored or were too tired to
iston? Students should not leave as-
sembly until it is dismissed. Every
student should at least have that
much interest for her Alma Mater.
The rule should be enforced.

SLEEP AND GROW RESTED

'l‘hoi‘c is one thing that we as col—
li: re students have to face and that is
the problem of sleep. Great minds
have piiinniaiischedulcs whereby we
may get from nine to twcch hours
oi? peaceful rest every night. By this
time we know that such a thing is
more or less a dream. By the time
note books are made upkrcquirod
readings done and lessons prepared
our sleeping schedule has been cut at
an alarming rate. but are we to
do? We must have sleep or catch
naps the next day. The latter is un-
satisfactory as well as unsafe. in
the ﬁrst place we must learn how to
rest. Half an hour of quiet during
the day helps wonderfully. It does-
ii’t do to try to get enough sleep one
night to last for two or three. Set
a fairly regular amount for each
night and try to stick to it. it is
well understood that we have given
up the idea of ever putting into pi'ac'
ticc that} plan whichl gives ton. to
twelve hours. but we can at least
inakc what sleep we do get a regular
a l'aii'.

In the second place. don’t stay up
half the night and make up for it
the next morning. Remember the old
adage that one hour of sleep before
twelve is worth two after.

Emotion Vii. Concentration
Girls, “lend inc your cars” to' this
important fact; girls concentrate bct-
tor than boys. "Concentration" was
the subject discussed by Florence
Hudson in freshman lecture April 5,
Emotion and concentration are op-
posites. for when one is highly ex-
cited one cannot conccntratc. Those
subjects which are pleasing to our

 

APRIL 11, 1924

tastes are the easiest ones on which
to focus our attention.
Reason for Concentration

Why do you concentrate? There
are various reasonsppcrhaps, it is fear
of pain, love of praise. hope of fu-
ture good. sense of duty. orla desire
to. do the best you can.
.Why one fails to concentrate is
because he may be doing too many
things at once or a too prolonged
oil‘ort.

Beneﬁt of Group Study

Can Group study bc cil‘cctivc and
beneficial? ’l‘hc keynote of the suc-
cess of group study is to think of
somebody else besides yourself. Ques-

tions from various members of‘a'
group come up winch can be readily‘
answered and prove to be of ii great

value.
Exams and Perlonnl Hygiene

What can it person do when there's‘

an awful exam coming and “Little
Joe Worry" claims him as a victim.
Dr. Croasdalc advises that ou sub-
stitute work for worry. Pay. read
or dance before an exam, do all you
(an and there will be nothing left to
do. Personal hygiene, says Dr. Croas-
daln, should be more emphasized at
such ii period than at any other time.

MR. CHAMPLIN CHARMS
POLITICAL SCIENCE CLUB
WITH EXPOSITION OF
FOLKLORE CUSTOMS

A Rabbit’s Foot and an “A”
Do you wish a. "working" charm
to carry about with you so that by
its magic you will pass all those
“finals”? Well, Mr. Champlin of the
State Library of the Education Build-
ing told “l’oli Si” Club all about it
on P‘i'iday, April 4. First of all, you
must secure the left hind foot of a
rabbit. The rabbit must be killed im-
mediately after you have secured the
foot. ’l'hen you carry the foot about
in your pocket, of course a “secret”
pocket, until. by chance you ﬁnd a
hollow trunk of a tree ﬁlled with
rain into which you dip the rabbit’s
foot. The charm is complete! An
“A” in every subject is yours!
What is a Superstition?
Superstition, said Mr. Champlin,
has gradually become folk lore thru
the ages. Superstition may be de-
ﬁned as opinions no longer in vogue,
in our times, but not of them. These
habits are handed down to us from
our ancestors. Everyone has a super—
stition or two. What girl would ever
take the last slice of bread on a plate?
If your teacher is cross. is it not be-
cause he got out, of the wrong side of
the bed this morning?
Origin of Salt Charm
In Leonardo da Vinci’s “Last Sup-
per", Judas has spilt the salt. He
probably did not throw some over his
left shoulder to chase away the bad
luck. This superstition probably ori-
ginated in some inland country where
salt was scarce and a child was
spanked for spilling the precious
product. . '

SOPHOMORES GET “AN EYE
FOR AN EYE” FROM THE
FRESHMEN AllTHORlETlES

Campbell and Comntnck Give'
Evasive Information

Attempts at revenge upon the part
of the sophomore class for the raid
made upon their soiréc by the fresh-
men failed last Friday, it became
known today, when news of an at-
tempted steal of the ’twcnty-soven
banner was corroborated by President
(iomstock of that class.

The freshmen now consider the
score even. both classes having failed;

. the freshmen in their resort to vio-

lence and the sophomores in their ile-
pendcncc upon strategy.

According to members of the fresh-
man class. ii group of sophomore men
last Friday tried to get the banner
from the parents of William Com-
stock at his home at Glcninont. The
President's mother was telephoned by
masquerading sophomores and told
that the banner was required at col~
logo to he used in a class picture. but
that her son was unable to come for
it and had iinOil them to do so.

Mrs, Comstock persuaded them to
wait for a short time during which
she communicated with the college by
telephone. Following that, the soph-
omores wore compelled to give up
the attempt.

President Herbert Campbell of the
sophomore class professed total ig-
norance of the happening when asked
concerning it by a News reporter. He
appeared solicitous regarding the wol-
farc of the freshman banner, how-
ever, and inquired” feelineg of its
presentwhereabouts. He declined to
locate the sophomore banner aside
from stating that it is in the western
hemisphere.
