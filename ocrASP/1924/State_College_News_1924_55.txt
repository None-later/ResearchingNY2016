MENTAL APHASIA AT STATE

A certain State college man was
out with a State college woman. On
leaving her home after having Ua-
corted her to and from the theater,
he started to carry away her parasol
when he happened to notice this ab-
acntmindedness aml said:

“Pardon me, but I started to run

She: “Oh, that’s all right.”

110': “I would have returned it.”

Sher “Well, I doubt whether you
would have remembered where you
got it.” ————
CHEMISTRY CLUB LEARNS

ABOUT “MOLECULES
AND. ATOMS"

Prof. Bron-an Highly Inlerening

To those members of the Chemistry
Club who attended the meeting Fri-
day. March 28, was given the privi—
lege of “listening in" on a very in-
teresting lecture on “Molecules and
Atoms” given by Professor Bronson.
Even though handicapped by want of
time, Professor Bronson covered his
topic in a very concise and compre-
hensive manner, and gave every lis-
tener a “corner” on the science ques-
tion.

STATE COLLEGIAN DASHED
T0 EARTH BY RACING
KIDDY CAR

One of our dear State Collegians
was peacefully wending her way
homeward thru the labyrinth oi.’ Ai-
banian thoroughfares, thinking gigan—
tic thoughts of the Roman Via Appia,
and dreaming delicious dreams of
roast beef and mother’s cooking. She
rambled on mechanically for that re-
ilex was so well developed that her
mind paid not a jot of attention to
it. Her mind? Oh yes, it was con-
structing an origina ed. thesis on
“'l‘extbooks ol.’ the Pro-Historic Age",
or an ode (perhaps inspired by Jun.
nile) on the "Wiles and Methods of
30th Century Feminines." 'I‘hat mind
was marching thru barbarous pages
of history solving Pythagorian theo-
ries of mathematics, and trying to
decipher “whereas I am and where-
l'ore am I bound?”

Thus was it pnilosopbying when—
by Jupiter, Appolo, and all the other
gods of High OIypus—the feet that
were attached to the other end of the
mind became entangled with a for-
eign substance. The three—year old
rascal, tearing down the sidewalk at
three miles per hour in his “Rolls-
Iloyce Speedster,” had sounded hIs
gong of instant death—but alas, the
dear State Collegian was oblivious to
external circumstances and especially
since those circumstances were so ex-
tenuating. 'I‘hus she fell, like the
glorious empire of which she was
dreaming. She might have been down
but was she out? Witness her noble
courage in face of all odds and her
arriving home just two minutes late
for the ﬁrst table!
