Three uniforms graced the gym floor

We were fortunate enough to have
with us that evening General Lee, an
admiral, noted, so he said, for his
conquests on land and sea as proved
by a fearful display of Prom favors
and medals, and o. sergeant who, by
his decorations, had never ich from
a tin can. both were in dross uniform
and shone equally with some of the
snappiest men in tux, State has ever
branded. Thus with the aforo~men-
tioncd conspirators, Annie Olson, Bil.
lie Hcinomann, and Emily Belding,
and the other half of Intersorority, not
to mention the “mean” men, wearing
what Emily Post designates as correct
for evening wear, the sorority girls
and their neophytes danced blithely
ihroug‘h the program.

Despite hints. disbelievim: that a
formal leap your dance for lntersor-
ority members would be supported,
Margo Baylcss, Kappa Delta chair-
man of the general committee pushed
to a successful culmination her ideas.
Zelma Gorman, Psi Gamma, provided
the punch and little cakes while Sara
Schoenberg and her cohorts made the
(lance orders. “Bun” Quinn, Chi Sh:-
ma Theta, and Margaret Eaton, Eta
Phi, secured the chapeions and Mary
Cornell of Gamma Kappa Phi spent
Saturday entwining the gym with gold
and purple. The service of the Col-
lege Jazz orchestra, composed of
Beulah Eckerson. Percy Briggs, and
Jack Hayes were secured by Helen
Elliot, Delta Omega.

POSTAL SKEE' HES FROM
PRO SSOR RISLEY

Professor Ilidley has received four
cards from Professor Risley. On one
is the pictorc of the famous bronze
doors at Pisa. and on the other side
he writes. “I took last night to over-
come a touch of grip. It has post-
poned our trip to Perutria and Aisisi
on the way to ltome. You will be
interested in my collection of postals
which i am getting from every place.
Here are the bronze doors on the
Cathedral nt I’isn. Of course the
doors on the Baptistary here at Flo-
rence are the really beautiful Rennai~
sancc. i should like to talk on Flo-
rence. it has amazed me.”

On another is a picture of the old
Vecchin bridge at Home. “A really
satisfactory old bridge. Read Long~
i'ellow’s sonnet on the “Old Bridge."
it is this Ponte Vecchio. It begins
I'I‘addio Gaddis built, me—' d
architects become real here; most of
them were goldsmiths originally, and
also sculptors and painters. Specially
true of Donatello.”

“London bridge and the Notre
Dame bridge at Paris. going to the
old city, disappointed me. Ponte
Vccchio looks as an old bridge ought
to look

On another: “Florence. Not yet
at ’l‘rista as this card indicates in fact
on our way south. but this is the. kind
of card the wounded give about for
what you will irivc them. also this is
part of ltaly’s still pressing ‘territorial
unity’ which we teach. just as Fuime.
You will be interested to know that
Sunday i couldn’t get into the Palaz~
zo Vccchio here at Florence because
they were celebrating" the addition of
Fuime."

On another Easter card‘ “A happy
wish for Easter with true Florentine
decoration. Hard not to buy con-
stantly in Florence. Pretty jewelry
trinkets are so cheap. Anything.r near
two dollars is expensive. Trinkets
can be bought from five cents to ﬁfty,
that are most interestin . In church
of Szinta is Amcrigo espucci who
is buried there.”
