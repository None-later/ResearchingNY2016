FIRST GAME OF SEASON
LOST T0 MIDDLEBURY

Forrest Caton Star of Game

 

 

 

'I‘ime and again it has been [woven
that a baseball game can be won or
lost in a single inning, Just as a box—
ing bout may come to an abrupt halt
in any one round. “Getting the
breaks” is usually the way it is put
when II close diamond game is sud.
denly broken up by one frenzied in-
ning.

'l‘he second inning will go down in
the list of State‘s hoodoos as a result.
of the Middlebury game a week ago.
For the opening game of the season
it was a great exhibit of diamond
play. with the Purple and Gold stoek~
ingod men deserving a large portion
of the praise that was showered up-
on the contest by press critics.

If one could eliminate the second
inning, it could be said that State
lost by a 2 to 0 score—a count which
would in itself give a big idea of the
brand of baseball that was played
by the two collegiate rivals. But

HERE’S ANOTHER BURN-
ING QUESTION—HAS A
LIBRARY FEELINGS?

Then Let's Be More Courteou-
and Relpeclful

Some people have different view-
points; this is a free country. H0w~
over, some couventiomdities must be
observed. some respect must be given.

What would we do without our

library?

Did you ever stop to think what
kind of a place a library is? Take,
for instance. our own library. What
would you do without it. or what do
you do to it when you have it? They
say [lowers have feelings, why not
rooms or books?

What do" Shaka-per: think at

We 8BR

i wonder what Shakespere thinks
as he- looks down from his fat vol-
umes when he sees some students
masticating (horrible sight!) some
pop corn balls or crisp potato chips.
Don’t you think his feelings are a
bit hurt?

Here's for a new resolution!

Make a new resolution to respect
the books on their shelves. even tho'
they do give us a lot of work. Maybe,
if we treat them better they will be
more interesting and give us a little
help over the hard spots in History
II or English Lit.

each grade receives a credit equiva-

hour; C is equal to 1 credit for each
hour.

D has no credit value, but D is pass-
ing if with the grades in all the other
subjects taken for a semester it aver-
ages a C. For example. if one were
taking twelve hours or work and re-
ceived D in three two hour subjects

The BS. degree given to students
majoring and minoring in the sciences
has been changed to a B.A degree
with a few alterations in require—
ments. Students desiring a B.A. de-
gree (this will now include all except
those who apply for a Rs. in com—
mercial, home economics. and educa—
tion) will be required to submit ﬁve
years of. language upon entrance. The
maximum amount of language re—
quircd in college, which will apply to
entering students with ﬁve years of
languid-1'0. will be three years. If the
student enter with six years two col«
lege years will be required. That is
to say. eight years of language count-
ing that taken in both high school and
college will be necessary for a B.A.
degree. Note that the change will
effect only entering students.

The reason for this change from
B.S. to B.A. is that a 3.8. degree has
many different and unequal values
while a B. A. degree possesses a deﬁn—
ite and universal meaning which can-
not be questioned.

The several changes which have
been made in the English department
will be discussed and brieﬂy explained
in next week’s “News.”
