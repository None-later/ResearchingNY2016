THE BASEBALL SCORE

The first game of' the baseball sea—
son was lost to Middlebury. There-
fore, we shall down every activity of
the team. because it will lose every
succeeding game.—-—“Fiddlenieksi" as
an indignant elderly maiden might
say. The team is a good team com—
posed of good material, capable of
playing a sportsmanllko game.

The name, not the score, is the
thing. Not only the baseball nine,
but every freshman, sophomore, ju-
nior and senior, composes the team.
Without every member playing his
part the baseball season will be worth-
less, with cooperation the season will
be a success, regardless of score.

LAWLWEM NESS

The report given by Mr. Walker
on the student conference at Wash-
ington, called for the purpose of dis-
cussing law enforcement, gave the
students an idea of the important
part they are called upon to play in
national affairs.
v The lawless conditions in manv col-
leges are shown to be quite g-ravo es-
pecially those conditions caused by
disregard of the eighteenth amend-
ment. Fortunately, State College has
escaped the blot of being a drinking
college, and according to present in<
dications, State College will continue
to be a dry college.

SENTENCE OF FUTURE
TEACHERS IN PENITEN-
TIARY SHORTENED TO
TWO HOURS ON G
BEHA

Special! Extra! Members of State
College Y. W. C. A. in Albany Peni-
tentiary! Sentence of future teach-
ers shortened to two hours because
of good behavior! Yes. it is sad but
true. For two whole hours, Sunday
morning, April 27. about a hundred
members of Y. W. were safely locked
away in the penitentiary. But there
is no cause for real alarm. They were
there to help conduct the regular Sun-
day morning service for the prison-
ers. and were then shown through the
building by Chaplain Vanderwort and
other officials. Y. W. C. A. wants to
thank the large number of girls who
were willing to come out so early and
help with the service.

 

STUDENT ASSEMBLY
CROWDED WITH
BUSINESS AND
AMUSEMENT

Jerome Walker Gives Report
of Council at Washington

Student Assembly Friday was a
busy place, and much was done.
Margery Bayless read the list of in-
niors eligible for next year‘s Mys-
knnia, in preparation for the chosinp;
of two members by vote of the col-
loge.

Jerome Walker. recently a dolomite
to the Student Council of Law En-
forcement at Washington, 1:1ch his
report. He showed that the principal
topic discussed at the Council was the
enforcement of the Eighteenth
Amendment, and he told what several
colleges have already done to prevent
the breaking of this law. Then, for
a time. everyone's attention was
turned from serlous things. like law
enforcement. to a musical program.
The orchestra started it. and was fol-
lowed by two song's. "Cradle Sony;
by 'I‘Schalkowsky, and “The Call" by
Mark Andrews, both sunp: by the we-
men’s chorus. Miss ltitzer sang
“Deep River" with ‘ccllo obligate by
Miss Johnson. Edward Vines’ most
pathetic rendering of" “Molly Ilruuiv
gun" brought bread smiles to the
faces of the audience, instead of mak-
ing; them share his chief. 'I'hen Mr.
Candlyn led the college in the singing
of the Ivy Song".

Returning to business. m'eatly re-
freshed by the rest. everyone was

ready with nominations for the focal-
ty member of the Finance Board.
Professors York. ulker. Birch-

enough, and Decker nominated. Then,
after announcements by Harry God-
frey, Pearl Knipe, and Margaret
Eaton. and the reading: of the notices
for the week, came the usual dash
for the stairs—and the cafeteria.

DORMITORY PLANS
ABOUT TO BE
ACCEPTED

Purchase of land in the vicinity of
State College as a site for the pro-
posed women's dormitory will be an-
nounced at the annual meetinp; of the
Eastern Alumni Association of State
College in June. The announcement
will be followed by definite action
leading to the actual construction of
the buildina.

tion committee appointed to conduct

Saylcs will make a complete report of
the last year's work of the committee
at the convention which will be held
at the college just before the com-
mencement day activities.

Architect’s plans for the proposed
dormitory have been prepared and
will probably be accepted by the
alumni. According- to present opti-
mistic indications. work will be start-
ed on the residence hall not later than
next fall.

“MANIKIN MINIKIN”
BIG success

When you were a child. did you
believe that late at night, when every-
one was asleep. the porcelain ﬁgures
on the mantel came to life. and talked
to each other? And did you wish
that you could hear them just once?
Those. who attended “Manikin and
Mlmkm”. presented Thursday, April
10. by the Advanced Dramatics class
under the direction of Rosaline
Greenbera, know that; when the clock
points to the Witching hour, the im-
ages do talk. Moreover. these for-
tunate people have heard their con-
versation, and know that they feel
and talk much like ordinary people.

Sarah Dranitzke. as the beautiful
and capricious Minikin, and Margery
Baylcss, as her lover, Manikin, faith-
ful even though he was always placed
so he could not see his beloved, show-
ed the very human feeling of love.
hatred, and jealousy. as felt by the
motionless ﬁgures. The play was an-
nounced as an experiment. It was
certainly a successful and altogether
delightful one.
