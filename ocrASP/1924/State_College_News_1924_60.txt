“HOPELESS” AND “HELP-
LESS" BUT HEAPED FULL
7 7 OF FUN

Publication  Amused nnd
Enlinhicncdllioculty and College

’I‘ho News nnd Quarterly llonrds
staged two big successes on Friduy
evening, April 25, when they enter-
tained the college students and i'ncui-
ty. The ﬁrst presentation, “Hope-
less,” typiﬁed a busy day in the News
olllce, just before the pnper goes to
press. Only those who have exper-
iench such a day realize how 'hectic’
it is, but Friday night rcvenled how
fast on oillce boy can move and how
cnpitblo reporters nre. No wonder the
popcr “nint” when it should inf—ill
spite of the noble eil'orts ol' the stnil'.
Fridny evening disclosed the secret.

“l-Iclpless”. the Quarterly Hoard
hit, was a parody on n Quarterly
Board meeting. ,It seems that ah—
sonce is the 1,. nc nl :litemiunee taken
at these meetings, if one judges from
Friday night’s performance. As for
inspirations. this stage burlesque
hinted that they left with Dr. 'l‘homp-
son’s duvunport. and that “ads” now
constitute the Quarterly. Howvver.
this comedy proved that the Quarterly
Board is by no means destitute of
ability.

Lollipops proved no barrier to ad-
mittance. riven the most dignified of
our professors bravely aceeptod one.
As for dancing. that ulwnys drnws a
crowd. ii the enthusiasm displayed
Friday evening was proof of a good
limo, suggestions are in order thnt
the News nnd Quarterly Board make
an evening's entertuimm-nt un unnuul
feature.

HEALIH_TALK

Athletics and Recreation. they are
greatly talked about today. These
subjects were discussed by the fresh-
men in their weekly lecture. Miss
i‘lthel DuBuis ’27. and Miss Georgian—
na Moor, '27, were the Speakers.

Miss DuBois took the athletic side
of recreations. She mentioned that
twenty years ago athletics for girls
were unthought of, but gradually the
beneﬁts of it were recognized. it
got its start. until today we have iu~
ternutional girls’ games.
