with its adequate gymnasium Facili-
ties for the development of a base-
ball team irrespective of the Weather
conditions, played a better game than
did State. but when the comparison
is made between the amounts of prac—
tice each team had before the contest
the superiority of the Purple and Gold
stands forth.

'l‘o "Penny" Caton must no the
lion’s share of credit for saving State
from an ignominous defeat. and to
Catch also must go a large part of
the blame for the ‘socoiid inning
blow-up." Caton twirled a marvelous
game after the second stanza. He
was working all his powers of con-
trol over the leather-covered pill and
he was being given almost uncanny
support in the field. The game was
really a pitchers’ duel with Caton on
the losing side in ‘getting the breaks.‘
State failed to hit in the pinches and
four runs were lost. men "dying" on
third base.

But during the past few days Couch
Wagner has polished up the roug
surfaces of his team and State’s nine
will journey to Hamilton tomorrow
for the annual contest with Colgate.
Coach Wagner is expected to send a
dii'erent line-up on the field than he
diil in last week's game. This Will be
done so iic can get a line on all the
members of his squad.

State is unusually gifted this year
in a staff of pitchers. Lebaron showod
his wares in a “follow-up” game at
Middlebury the day after the regular
contest and he appenis to be one of
the best bets for the Colgate game.

second game with Middlcbury by an
S to 5 score. but the defeat will not
go down on record because it was
more or less of a practice game and
was not scheduled.

The inﬁeld is probably State's
weakest point. It is the general opin—
ion that Hornung will have to step
back into his old-time stride if he
wants to hold his varsity berth. i'or
Gainor is making a strong bid for
guardian of the initial sack. Captain
Stahlmaii also will have to rub some
of the kinks out of his arms. as-will
several others on the squad. if fans
are to enjoy an interesting season.

STATE COLLEGE NEWS,

DELAY IN NEW BUILDING
PLANS EXPLAINED BY
STATE ARCHITECT

Atlioagh the Byrne appropriation
bill was not passed by the late legis-
lature. construction of Milne Science
hall will not be held up. it is an-
nounced by President Brubncher. In
compliance with the dictum of (lov-
eraor Smith the (emulation of the
new building will be put under con-
struction in the [all and the next leg—
islature will be called upon to make
appropriation for the‘ completion of
the job.

The defeat of the Byriio bill came
after it had been included in the fa-
vorable report of the Senate ﬁnance
committee. Governor Smith iiistruct~
ed the committee not to report any
appropriation bills that provided mon-
ey for state structures which have
not yet been begun although they
were given initial funds a year ago.
Since the 1.023 legislature had grant-

ed $75,000 for the new Milne iiall ‘

project and since that sum has not
yet been touched. the Byrne bill met
the same fate as a batch of other
money requests.

it is now the purpose of Dr. Bru-
hacher and State Architect Sullivan
Jones to start construction with the

“5.000 aml then in January ask the‘

1925 lawmakers for the rest of the
$000,000 appropriation. Ground will
be opened for the foundation work at
the opening of the September term.
The work will then continue until
climatic conditions prevent further-
ance of the job.

Dr. Brubnchcr explains that the
reason he did not go ahead last year
and start construction with the ini-
tiul fund was because he had been
advised by the state architect that it
would not be a good ﬁnancial plan.
it was painted out by Mr; Jones. ac-
cording to Dr. Bruiiacher. that the‘.
better plan would be to let the \vholei
contract at once. i
