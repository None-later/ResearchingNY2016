Myskania members are in charge
of the “personally conducted” hunts

small lion (plaster-paris, and guar-

anteed harmless) in three bin build- '

inirs. _._.

NEWMAN MAY DAY

Sunday. May 4. marked the open-
ini: day of the May Capers of New-
nnin Hall. A committee with Rita
Mackcy as chairman had scheduch
May Morninp; Breakfast on the
countryside. Fresh strawberries, hot
dogs, doughnuts! Eats to make the
most bored of individuals sit up and
take notice! Unfortunately, His
Lachrymal Majesty, Pluvius, had sche-
duled his usual reception, and Sun-
day morning: found the grass shining"
with raindrops. Thus the Newman-
ites were forced to hike to the break-
fast room at 741 Madison Avenue.
The change in destination. however.
did not affect the uin spirit of the
crowd and they all look forward with
enthusiasm to next week’s caper

 

  

 

 

which is under the supervision of

NEW SPORT

How shocking! What? llnwn'i
you noticed the new recreation at
State? For those that haven’t we will
inform them that it is Roller Skuiiiiu.
Furthermore, our “digniﬁed” SOIIIOI'S
are the ringlczidcrs in this new sport.

How much does a piiir of roller
skates cost? This is the vital uni-ri—
tion now-a~(lziys. Why not pi-rmn-
iieiitly establish this 5 art. Let’s roi-
ler skate from one o ass to another.
This has been done in other colleen-r.
