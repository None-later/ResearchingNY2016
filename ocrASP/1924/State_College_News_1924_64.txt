HENRY CAVENDISH

' l7Ri-liiiu

English Chemist and physicist,
of whom Bini said, "He was
the richest of the learned and
lhe must learned of the rich.
His last great acliievememwns
his {anions experiment to de-
termini:lhedcnsityofthecarlh.

He ﬁrst made
water from gases

Henry Cavendish, an eccentric millionaire
recluse, who devoted his life to research,
was the discoverer of the H and the O in
H0. In fact he ﬁrst told the Royal Society
of the existence of hydrogen.

He found what water was by making it
himself, and so became one of the ﬁrst of
the synthetic chemists.

Cavendish concluded that the atmosphere
contained elements then unknown. His
conclusion has been veriﬁed by the dis-
covery of argon and other gases.

The Research Laboratories of the General
Electric Company have found a use for
argon in developing lamps hundreds of
times brighter than the guttering candles
which lighted Cavendish’s laboratory.
