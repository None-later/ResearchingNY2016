MISS MARTINEZ

With our mothers. fathers. and
friends. we came to the Spanish car-
nival. We came in such numbers that
the auditorium was packed. We saw.
we enjoyed. we pronounced the entire
program a success. But did we stop
to think what work was necessary to
stage such an event? Many did not.
Had we stopped for a moment to con-
sider we would have enjoyed it even

more.

Without the untiring efforts of
Miss Martinez. the. carnival. one of
State’s biggest events. Would havo
fallen far short. It required many
hours of time and cll'ort that it might
be what it was. a success.

Not only the Spanish club. but the
entire student body owes Miss Mar-
tinez a vote of appreciation for the
Carnival, which. due to her efforts,
brought crowds from afar and sent
them away satisﬁed.

POINT SYSTEM CHANGES

When the point system was ﬁrst
brought before the students it caused
very little comment. As is the case
with many other new suggestions it
received too little consideration.

It was something new to most of
the students and they were willing to
give it a chance.

Then along came class elections,
and havoc on the point system be-
gan. It could mean only one thing,
resignation in frightening numbers.

What was the result? A remein
must be found at once. and as is al-
ways the case in time of need. a
remedy was found. A revision of the
point system was made. By it some
have beneﬁted. to others it has made
no difference.

Another revision may be expected
as soon as a special need arises. The
system was put in effect to more
evenly divide the ofﬁces among the
students. If the very fundamental
ideas of the plan are to be kept, the
student body must think, really think.
before it makes a rash move.

 

 

STATE COLLEGE NEWS,

DR. THOMPSON GRADU-
ALLY REGAINS HEALTH
AFTER NERVOUS
. BREAKDOWN

The health of Dr. Thompson is
gradually improving, according: to
persons in close touch with him at his
home. He is still under the cure of
a physician and is not permitted to
take much exercise. A diagnosis of
his case showed that Dr. Thompson
was suii‘ering from a serious nervous
breakdown. but it is now believed that
he is on the road to complete recov-
cry.

At his home at 914 Madison nve~
nuo. Dr. Thompson is taking a much
needed rest. his physical advisers
say. Very few friends are allowed
to disturb the patient, since it is
claimed overwork and constant ming-
ling in social ull'airs are responsible
for his ill-health.

Privileged visitors include Dr. Bril-
bacher and Mr. Candlyn. Mr. Cand-
iyn is planning to be a constant com—
panion. as far as possible, of Dr.
Thompson until the latter recovers.
So far no deﬁnite plans have been
made by Dr. Thompson himself or by
his medical attendants for an ex-
tended ti-ip during his caiiviilcsccnco.
it is said. howrwei'. that he may take
short trips in the country during the
summer.

Dr. Thompson has been obliged to
give up his entire activities in the
music world pending the regaining of
his health. He devotes considerable
of his time. nevertheless. to the casu-
al study of his particular interests.
He will not be able to resume his
classes at college this semester. nor
will he be able to take his customary
summer school courses.

MOTHERS HEAR 0F PHASES
OF COLLEGE LIFE AT
SATURDAY AF TER-

NOON TEA

It is to be regretted that so few
attended the tea Saturday afternoon
held especially for mothers and
daughters in connection with the
Mother and Dau‘ghter week-end. In
three brief informal talks, President
Brubacher spoke of the freedom of
life at this college. Dean Pierce
begged for sympathy as a college
mother of 1017. and Dr. Croasdaie
maintained by effective arguments her
familiar declaration that the health
department is the moat important de-
partment at college.

MOTHER AND DAUGHTER
WEEK-END ACCLAIMED
POPULAR BY ALL

The Mother and Daughter week-
end arranged by Y. W. C. A. rates as
the most successful enterprise under-
taken by that organization this year.
Judging from the praise given by the
visiting mothers to the girls in charge.
they considered it a most marked
success. .

Registration, the visiting of classes,
the Spanish supper and the carnival
made one day a complete entertain-
ment. The bus ride, the tea, the
concert rounded out another divert-
ing day. Church, luncheon and ves-
pers concluded the week-end and gave
to the students and their mothers
many pleasant memories.

SUMMARY OF P
CARRERS OPEN 

Sara Barclay, '27, Gave Review of
Possibilities

The Moving Picture industry is one
of the greatest Opportunities open to
women today. This subject was our
oi the phases taken up by Sara Unr-
kicy. ’27, on Thursday. May 1. at
li'eshmzin lecture on the topic, “Voca-
tions Open to Women."

H Editorial Work

llic most famous of editorial di-
rectors in the moving pictures is Jinn-
Muthis who directed “Blood and
Sand.” and "The Four Horsemen oi.’
the Apocalypse”. Another job which
many women fill is that of writing the
stories. They may write one story and
get it ﬁlmed; this is called a single
Job. However, some are connected
With a company. and write stories for
that particular one. There are those
who write the titles and sub—titles.
and those who follow the director
about With script in hand to see that
every detail is carried out. Still,
others are costume designers.

Teaching

.As we all intend to be teachers.
Miss Barclay touched upon Teaching
as a vocation. Why are we teachers?
l‘here are. of course. many reasons.
One is the great demand for teachers.
The salary is very good especially in
the last few years. When one enters
the teaching profession. there are not
many risks as. for instance. in open-
ing a law olﬁce after just graduating
from law school, Teaching is part
time work. and the summer may be
employed to further onc’s interest or
Just spent in recreation. All teach-
ers do not teach in high school; there
are grade teachers. kindergarten
teachers. and teachers for the blind.
if one is interested in such work.
