SPANISH CARNIVAL
COLORFUL EVENT

'l‘he crowning: event of the your!
The Spanish Carnival! Fragrance of
roses, eany dressed [lower-girls, great
briu'ht bubbles of red. blue and yellow
balloons bobbing above heads of the
audience in the crowded auditorium!
With the smell aid of the magic carpet
ol.’ imagination and s-s-s—t. we were in
the drowsy land of? Spain at II ‘licsta’.
Amid the softly lighted lanterns,
palms, and quaint; screens, I‘lmily Held-
inI: led the performance in the whirl,
dash and fire of a gypsy dance. Which
one of us could resist the charms and
beauties of the three dolls so advan—
tageously portray -l by their vendors,
and who could r ‘ buying a “llora”
or a “ram” from Edna Shal'I-r even
if one didn’t understand her soup; ex-
actly'.’ bit of the warmth and ro-
mance of old Spain, and the sensuous
Castilliun languidness wul'ted about
the evening scene where Edward
Vines serenaded his senorita before
her window, and seemed steeped in
the grace of the tango dancers, Betty
Natale and Florence Barry. Mary
It‘lunap‘un’s dance caught a. bit of the
mystery and ﬁrelia'ht of Spain, and
Louise Welch delighted us with dainty
toe~dancinp1. What chills and thrills
when Emily Beldinc: and Ruth Mc—
Nutt enacted the Spanish Lovers’
dance and aroused the adventurous
spirit in the Pirate‘s danch The per-
formance ended with scenes from
Spain as the sweet cry of. the llower
girl, Sara Dranetskie, the newspaper
boy, the “peon”, the dark-eyed gyp-
sy, and the tall Epaniard. Everyone
then went down to the Gymnasium
where the radiant Queen, Anne Stole:-
ncng'er, acc0mpanied by her senoritas,
took her royal seat. Then we were
presented with scenes of Columbus.
III the landing: of Columbus, Profes-
sor York tilled the place of Columbus
in our imaginations cll'ectively, and
Miss Morris, Miss; Johnson and Doctor
Bike. Mr. Deyo as Indians. certainly
lent the color to the scene. The linal
scene was the appearance of Colum-
bus before the Kine and Queen of
Spain, Professor Decker and Eunice
lticc. The evening was then closed
by dancing.

Most people have the mistaken idea
that sunburn is caused by “the heat
of the sun.” This is incorrect. Sun.
burn is caused by the ultra~violet
rays, which constitute only seven per~
cent of sunlight.

Nature herself provides II form of
protection against the ultra-violet
rays, for when a person is exposed
continually to sunlight lll' will lind
that after several attacks of sunburn,
the skin becomes tanned or frockled.
Tan and freckles are, simply the na-
tural piument which nature provules
as a yellow screen throne-h which the
ultra—violet rays cannot pass and
cause real injury by continqu burn-
inc.

People with tender or fair skins
will not severely sunburned many
times before they can act the coat of
tan or freckles, which serves as a yel-
low screen to keep out the ultra-vio-
let or burning rays of sunlight.

Science. howuver. has come to the
rescue of those who enjoy sunshine
and the out—of—doors but who dread
the pain and injury of sunburn or
the disfigurement of a yellowish coat
of tan or freckles.

'l‘his scientiﬁc discovery is based on
the well-known fact that a substance
as transmiront as class screens out
the ultra-violet rays. One can be
exposed to sunlight under glass for
an indeﬁnite period and net health-
l'nl. beneficial I-ll'ects ol‘ the rays with-
out beine- burned. ’l‘ho gardener
urows his tender young" plants under
glass, where they thrive in the sun-
light from which the ultra-violet or
burning rays have been screened oll'
by glass.

Research workers in the course 01'
their laboratory investigations into
the properties of ultra-violet lie'ht.
have discovered a chemical which Is
as transparent as glass but which has
