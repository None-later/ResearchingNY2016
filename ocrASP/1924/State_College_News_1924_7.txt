AN UNSOLVED PROBLEM

Books. papers. l‘ancy work, and the
College News are not to be taken
into student assembly. [13 they are
taken in by mistake they are not to
be looked at and used durinp; the as-
sembly period.

The student body voted unanimous—
Iy in favor of oheyinr: this rule two
years ago, but has apparently forgot-
ten the fact or else doesn't care about
being: courteous to the people in
charge of the assen'lbly program.
Whatever the motive, the result is 21

especially to those outside speakers
who are forced to endure It.

ON THE EVE 0F VICTORY

e’l‘hc absolutely inevitable has come
and now we are mustcrinu every
atom of nervot : energy and every
electron 01' mtntality for that big
battle of brains. It‘s a ﬁght that
we’ve anticipated and have been pre-
paring: for more or less for the past
twenty weeks and now that the crisis
of it is really upon us. we’re going
to show what there is in us. It’s
been a rather happy march, packed
full of thrills and jolly fun, with the
impediments of labor delightfully
light and uncombersome.

But now we must throw down the
superﬂuous and gay frivolities—-the
professors have dealt out exceedingly
heavy baggage which must be born
with the same spirit of gamcncss and
indulgence. They have all‘orded us
the opportunity of a battle array. to
prove to ourselves and to others the
fundamental purpose of our presence
in college, and to exercise the metal
of that thing called grey matter.

So we're going to put to the best
advantage all the judgment and horse
sense which are the product either of
inheritance or of development, then
we are groin]: to be economical with
the mid—night oil, and finally go to it
with all that th ‘ is in us. The lines
are drawn. We're on the marlh! Aim!

Seven Delegates Sent

Albany? Where is Albany? To
the Student Volunteer Convention in
Indianapolis, New York State itself
.mcant nothing; but a comparatively
[small splash of color on the map.
Yet everyone could ably discuss the
Renaissance of China, the missionary
independence of Japan. the religious-
fanatics of India. and the .l’aithl'ul
devotion of the Africans to foreign
|workers. The world grow larger to
the State College delegates: Miss
Wallace, of the faculty, Aileen Wal-
lace, ’24, Ella Chase, ’25, Dorothea
Delta. ’25, lva Hinman, ’25, Miriam
Snow, ’26. and Georgiana Maar. ’27.

As well as the lectures of Sherwood
Eddy, John R. Mott. and Robert
Spoor—a few of the leaders of the
huge Tabernacle —— turbaned men
from the East spoke and dark-skinned
ones from the South. The religious
potentatcs ol,’ all lands were there to
brim: to the umlerm‘aduutos a unilicd
conception ol‘ the opportunities in the
world for service. The small discus-
sion groups s ed as ﬁelds where
student repr ,ntativcs pl' dill‘orent
sections of on: country and the world
met and discussed common problems
and means ol‘ solvinc‘ them. View
points wuru exchanged with such tol-
e‘ance and sympathy that a united
world seemed possible as well as
theoretic. By far the majority ol.‘
delegates voted in the open Forum
for some international organization
such as the League ol.‘ Nations or the
World Court as an active means of
preventing war. Education thru
.chanired text books to an internation-
al rather than merely national point
ol‘ view was also heartily approved.

MILITARY TACTICS

“— Mother of an army great ——-”
which, when left unguarded for a
minute. breaks up into pandomonium.
Regard for order. courtesy. rank. is
temporarily forgotten due to the ab-
scnce of rigid authority and supervi-
sion. The warnings of admonition
and advice of live minutes previous
are as ancient and unknown history
to the ranks composing; this army.

Valuable lessons in stampcoding,
worthy of a two-reel wild-west thrill-
er. are given every Friday at eleven
thirty-ﬁve, when a demonstration of
technically perfect mob rule is given
at close of student assembly. The
imass tactics of this army could not

.be equalled. but its discipline and re-

luard for rank are as naive as those

PATRIOTISM AND COLLEGE
SPIRIT

What is Patriotism? Is it sinpclm,r
the Star Spangled Banner? Is it
waving the Flag"! Is it talking ubout
the superiority of our country over
others. and condemning all who do
not talk as loud and in the same man-
ner as we do? No! It is u love for
our country which will permit us to
see her faults but will cause us to de-
vote our energies, not in defending
her faults, but rather in correcting
them.

What is College Spirit? Is it be-
ing able to repent word for word our
college song's? .Is it a bitter denun-
ciation of all students who do not
think as we do about athletics, student
regulations. and other matters per-
tainlnp: to our school life? Rather
is it a sense of justice which will
cause us to realize that we have re-
ceived much from our Alma Motor,
and that we owe in return a high
measure of respect and lidclity. It
will cause us to refrain from contin‘
ual complaints. and will limit our
criticism to the type that is construc-
tive, and which will help our college
to attain her rightful place as a
lender in education.

MUSICAL PROGI—l—AM IN
ASSEMBLY FRIDAY

Two New Rules Read

An excellent musical prourannne
was given by the College orchestra
in Assembly, Friday, January 11,
under the direction of Professor
Candlyn and Dr. Thompson. The
women’s chorus sanp; several selec-
tions, and Miss Zelma Gorman (le-
liu'hted the entire student body with
her song: of the Scottish people.

The new Inter-Sorority rush rule,
stating that a girl who has violated
the College traditions was not eligible
for membership in any sorority, was
read for the ﬁrst time.

The rule made by Myskania re—
garding College traditions was also
presented to the student body.

THREE ONE ACT
PLAYS DEMONSTRATED
VERSITALITY OF
DRAMATICS CLASS

‘ l'laiiuruisim.r thrills, anxious sus-
pense. and dellulltlul humor \Vl'l'l'
vcd up to the students and tln-ir
lriends last Saturday evening: by Lhw
elementary Dramatics class.

The ﬁrst surprise rnnn- al'ter the
opening numbers by the orchestra.
when the curtain rose on the under-
ground temple whose realncss was
testiﬁed by the shudders ol' the audi-
anc. The innocence ol.‘ the dainty
inueen. the suspicion of the princes.
and the awe-inspiring outpouring of
the Nile in "’l‘ho Queen’s Enemies."
made one at the most diil'icult stage
productions oi.‘ a State College Dru»
imatics class an ell'cctivo success.

No creator contrast could be found
C between two characters than between
“Sal” and “Minnie”, and no two
persons could have been found to
play the parts more skillfully. Mar-
garet Eaton will always be the world»
ly-wise sophisticated “vamp” to State
College students, and Harriet Barer
can never be other than the sweet,
dreamy “Columbine.”

The advance notices ol.‘ Mr. Van
Kleeck’s first appearance on the
American stage were certainly not
over rated. nor was thelatest of Mr.
Vines’ many appearances any disap-
pointment. Edith Higgins as Mar-
garet Crawshaw was indeed a “good
wife" and Marion Bessctte as “Viola”
made a charming English maiden,
worthy of a better name than “Wur-
zel-Flummery.” Though Mr. Reidy’s
ﬁrst appearance was rather startling;
his exit was all that could be de—
sired of even a budding- playwright.

Credit is due Miss Futterer. who
directed these plays, and to those
who took part in them and the com-
mittee workers who managed the un—
seen mechanics.
