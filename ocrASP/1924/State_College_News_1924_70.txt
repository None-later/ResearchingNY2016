last Friday.

j'l'he clas

  

V of ’27 scored 32 points
in the yeai struirisle. four more than
the record of the sophomores.
Aniimincenient of tin lt was made
at the step sing last I“ day night and
was the icon! for a burst of applause
in which sophimores joined.

The sophomores had been leadiup.‘
throughout; the year and had increased
their total five points by their suc—
cess in the ma Freshmen
and sophomotcs each scored on the
eve of Moving—up Day, the sopho-
mores winning- the itirl’s tug,»- of war
and the freshmen the men‘s banner

WIN SPECTACULAR BANNER
RUSH

The green of, the class of '27 an~
ing in the air twenty feet above the
Administration Building and ten feet
higher than the blue of ’26 brought
victory to the freshmen last Thursday
Night in the men's interclass banner
rush.

Handicapped by Sillllll"l' numbers.
and with the advantage of weight. on
the side of their opponents, the fresh-
men managed by superior strategy to
defeat the sophomores who had been
conﬁdent of victory on the eve of the
battle.

Failure of sophomores to raise
their fleet of balloons bearing: the
blue streamer above the Science
Building: and the subsequent loss of
the balloons was a. deciding factor in
the struggle which lasted thirty min-
utes.

Most of the fight was invisible to
the several hundred students who
crowded the campus. Freshmen and
sophomores reached the doors of the
- college on equal terms after a wild
dash from the corner in front of Syd-
,iluvm. Halt. _ Three minutes later

FACULTY CHANCES
ATTENDANCE RULES
FOR BETTER SYSTEM

Harder for 'he Student but more
Beneficial {o Scholasth Records.

CUT SYSTEM ABOLISHED

Credit Hours Paid as Forfeit

 

 

The faculty council has voted to
abolish the cut system which has been
in ant-ration since [918 owinu‘ to the

abuse which seems to be iiievitiibl)

connected with the system in use.
There seems to be a prevalent belief
that under a cut system a student is
entitled to a certain number of ab-
scences. not because illness or some
other emergency makes such absence
necessary but because a system of
cuts is in operation. This is the
opposite of the original intent of the
rule. Regular attendance upon col-
lege duties is just as binding: upon
students as it is upon the faculty.
The formation of habits of meeting:
obligations promptly and regularly is
one of the prime necessities in the
preparation of teachers. Absentinp.‘
oneself from the class room for tri-
vial reasons or because of failure to
prepare work is as much out of place
in college life as in any occupation.
With these facts in mind the faculty
council voted to abolish the system
which has encouraged laxity.
