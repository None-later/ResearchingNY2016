TEACHERS REJOICE AT
RULING OF STATE T0
GIVE EQUAL PAY

More Incentive For Teaching
' him Before.

 

Gov "nor .Smith has signed the
Cole—unntin bill removing the ine-
equality in salaries paid to men and
women teachers. ’I‘hei'e has been
much opposition to the bill. Chiel'ly
high school teachers will be all'cclud
by the new law as few men teach in
preliminary schools. It is clnimrd
that the rise in women’s salaries to
approach those of men will invoke a
deinaiid from preliminary tachcrs l’or
an increase. raising: taxes to an ciior-
mous amount. Governor Smith says,
“I am unable to understand why a
woman performing exactly the same
duties as a man should receive less
compensation for her services."
