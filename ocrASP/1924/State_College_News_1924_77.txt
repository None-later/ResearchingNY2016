To the students of State (mill-us,
1\lllu|\)' ntl‘ords ' major advan-
tages and numhe minor ones.
When one thinks of Albany educa-
tionally. one thinks of the Education
building, a gateway to the finest
litcr'iture. the best source hooks, the
finest. inspiration one could find in
combination. One also thinks of the
Capitol, representing- one of the hitch—
ist types of political and governmen-
tal centers in the United States, a
place of great interest. and inforiiia~
tion.

When one thinks of health. pleas-
urc or comfort one has but to con-
side Wnsliinuton Park. a place of
beauty, composure, and enjoyment,
for in this park one may sit. on a
bench and look contentele at the
green surroundings, blue sky, and
flowr-i's: or one may go nvhnatine' on

 

 

tlu- atu re lake :. or one may
wa alone the paths or play
tennis. The park is one of Albany’s

greatest advantages, and it is just
across the street from college.

'l‘here are other parks with tennis
courts, swings, and swiiiiniinp; pools.
’I‘hr-re are storw of every variety
where commodit as are not only de-
sirable but obtainable; and for these
of who conserve our energy by
riding there are street cars whiCh
most oblie‘inuly carry one, for seven
cents, to almost any port of the city.

NEW BUILDING FOR STATE

i Last year when we heard that at
Ilast our anxious hopes and continu-
‘ous strue'e'les of fiVo \'( irs for more
‘lniul and new building, were to cul-
,llllllilld? iii an increased amount of
lniid. we were incredulous. However,
last full we realized that our hope

s a reality, when We missed the
( stomed llill boards from their old
position west of the college. Now,
following last year’s appropriation
for land. the legislature of tilted has
.ippi'miriated funds to erect a group
of buildings on this land.

Anioni: tliiseronp will he a model

 
 

  

high school tor p‘actice teaching,
with consultation rooms for the

critics. 'l‘li will accustom the prac-
tice teachers to lllt conditions of a
typical, modern high school. and also
relieve the congestion of college by
openinp: the third floor for college
classes.

'ilie buildings will contain prov's—
ion for laboratories of the Biology
and Home i'lconoinics departments as
wrll as recitation rooms for these
departments. This will increase the
efficiency of these departments and
facilitate research work. An nudi-
tol'ltliii will be included which will
:l(’i!u|lllll(ltlut.3 the entire student body
'll one time. This will be modeled
.‘i'oni the best of New York’s “little
theatres.” it will he used for recit-
ils ol‘ the Music. department, plays
presented under the English depart.-
nent, and student ' a ,nibly. it will
ll“o he in daily use for Clll ‘
wli’cli instruction in play production
and acting is elven. As a unit, the
building's will contain thirty '
rooms and fifteen lnohoi'iito . A
complete e'yniiiasiuni will be included.
’l‘hus \Vt‘ can play niid entertain
yisiline' tennis on our oivn court.

'l‘li' remainder of the grounds will
become a part of the campus. it is
planned to fence il. in and use i" for
an athletic field. Ground will be
broken for those building‘s very soon
and next. fall may see the first story
risinu.

THE FRESHMAN HANDBOOK

l‘ll't'Slllllilll entei'iiiy,y State College
have no occasion for bewilderment,
(or their . or class each year pre-
i'lllt‘n‘ a Freshman Handbook, as a
source ' information to guide them
a-rie'lit. This handbook is not typical
of State College, but it is a publica-
tion that shows that State is wide
awake and on a par with other col—
' in this respect.

'Ilic first handbook was published
and presented to the entering- class
in tilts-id by Y. W. C. A. t cons
taincd, at that time, bri sketches
of college history, traditions, and
activities with a list of churches and

religious societies in the city. Since
that time succeeding; freshmen
classes have left their worries at

home for each year the little guide
book has appeared in a better, more
complete form.

in lillt), Y. . . A., having
established the publication and
provoil its neelzs’dty, withdrew from
its support and turned it over to the
Junior Class.

The last two issues of the hand.
book have not only contained college
information but also, information
about the city of Albany. Lists of
theatres, libraries, churches, and a
guide map have been included in the
book. The freshman cannot get lost
or lone ome as lone: as he keeps this
little ' ' ml at hand.

As it first appeared the handbook
was a modest little paper covered
book which looked like an ordinary
memorandum. The last issue, how-
ever, was a modest little paper
covered book just "chuck full" of all
sorts of information for the Fresh-
men. The class of 1925 gave the
‘hesl; possible book to the class of
‘1927 and the class of 1926 is going
‘to do the some for the new class of
