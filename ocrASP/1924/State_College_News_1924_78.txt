Although winning but two of the
scheduled games of the season. the
basketball team has mode decided
strides toward better work; and even
a losing game has brought 11 certain
degree of satisfaction, for the men
have played the game well. It is not
so much a. winning team that counts
as‘the way the game is played; the
quintette the past season has set a
standard that future teams will do
well to follow. They have proved
that it pays to be a good loser even
when victory would he sweeter.
After all the real purpose of athletics
is to promote good fellowship and
good sportsmanship. Viewed in this
light the season has been a real, and
it is hoped, lasting victory for State.

Jacks“.

“Juck” has led his men thru a year
of hard work and has proven that
the confidence of the men was not
misplaced when they chose him to be
their leader. Even though he comes
from the for north, the famous place
called Bonnet, he has become a shin—
ing light; as one of the best guards
that ever wondered to State. The
north must give perserverence, for
Juck has never been known to quit.

Putnam.

At last “Put” has proved that he
came to college for another purpose

ilucky number of 13 games during the

Carrolan.

“Jimmey” has given basketball n
wide berth since his Freshmen your.
yet he came out at the beginning of
this season determined to play the
game. That he made the team is
suilicient proof that he did some hard
work. When Jimmy started for
the basket. State nlwnvs knew some-
thing was in line for State.

Caton.

“Peggy”, n forward from lost your

the ranks ol‘ those who toss the bull,
and sure lived up to the reputation
that he gained for himself lost your.
Peggy is a good man to have on a
team, and State will lose a valuable
player when Peg leaves college this
spring.

Davies.

Hailing from Gettysburg, “Watty”
came with o crush. He not only
made the team but played in nearly
all the games. Not’ only was Davies
at fast guard; he always was there
with a clean and sportsnmniike game.
Lucky it was for State thnt Wutty
decided to take up teaching as a pro-
l‘ession. Otherwise it would have

in‘ entered into the full s n t of 1hr

an opponent. It is hoped that Herb
will be here next your to boost sum
on the way to victory.
