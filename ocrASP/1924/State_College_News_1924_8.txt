SCORE 15—3 IN FAVOR OF
JUNIORS

It? no personal fouls are called in
a game at basketball, either the play—
ing is slow, or unusually self-controll-
cd. or exceptionally well trained. In
the game of January nth, in which
the Juniors outscored the sophomores
15-8, no personal tools were recorded.
'l‘o discover what is responsible for
this condition, the next (l. A. A. in-
terclass names should be well sup-
ported. Judging from the score, the
HODIIOIIIOI'U‘i played a cautious game
against well—trained juniors. The
class ol‘ 1925 might have piled up
a bia'hvr score had not the necessity

for tryinp: new combimitions inter~
vened.

TAKE A LOOK AT VENUS

'Dja ever see Venus‘.’

No. not the statuary, but the real,
homvst—to—uodness Venus, who ms
stunned thoiuuinds‘.’

Well, it' you haven’t, you’re behind
the times, for nearly every 'l‘uesday
night a group 01' especially privileged
|)t'1 nus call on the marvelous beauty.
Yes, and she even lets her visitors
gaze at her and become charmed.

But still, Venus is only one 01' the
many features of star-gazing, a won—
dert'ul indoor sport; that is open to all
State College would-be, and other-
wise, astronomers.

All you need is a card, which is
easi ' obtainable from Benjamin
1305., director at the Dudley Observa-
tory, and you are all titted out with
a ticket to lots ol.‘ free fun and inter~
csting‘ entertainment every Tuesday
night.

Just imagine proving- [or yourself,
no matter what Einstein or Dr. on-
well says, that the moon is made of
limburg‘er, or maybe rochefort,
cheese. or better still, having the little
satellites of Satan squint at you!
Wouldn't that be thrilling when you
stop to ‘consider that all planets,
which appear to be right in front of
you. are millions and hundreds of
millions of miles away?
