of arousing a greater interest in dra- .

student tax automatically makes each
student ii iui-nilier ol‘ the Association.
'i‘lius it includes practi ~ally tiil' eiiiiri-
siudent body and insures Io everyone
an equal share in the beneﬁts de-
rived. 'l‘he "iciatioii is l'inaiicrd
by an appropri tion from the student
lax fund

The control of
rests with the Dramatic . Art
Council at nine members, three in-
ciilty members and two students from
each of the upper closes. The coun-
cil elects its own oliieers and tran-
sacts all the business of the Associa-
tion. The ofﬁcers for lEJZi-lli‘la are
president; Gwendolyn Jones, '25:
secretary; Olga iiilmlli'l, '26.

The outside attractions brought on
by the Association were a li‘Ctlli't' on
“Ceramics” by Cliarl. Biuns. an
illustrated lecture on Sculpture by
lioi'ada 'i‘all‘t. a print exhibit from
the American Federation 01' Art and
a group of plays by the dramatic
cla..

Altogether it has been a most suc-
cessi'ul year financially and the stu-
dent body and the city of Albany.
have henei‘ited greatly.

accepted by the student body there
has been much discussion as to the

impossible for one student to hold so

passed; 'l‘he new system makes the

l'ollowing provisions:

COLLEGE ORCHESTRA

The College Orcliost'a has been
particularly prominent this year.
making its appearance in Assembly
twice during the past semester. ren—
dering sewral selections at the Mid-
winter concert and the Spring con-
cert given in the College Auditorium
under the auspi s ol' the Music
Association. Also the long intermis-
sioiis between the presentations of
the plays staged in the Vincentian
institute by the 'Driiinatics Classes
were made more endu'able due to
the eil‘orts ol‘ the orchestra. A re-
presentation of the orchestra plays
each year at Dr, Bi'ubacher’s recep-
tion on June 1(‘.

However, the orchestra entails
even more than simply preparation
For public appearance. ’l‘here is a
sort of close association between fei-
low students interested in the same
work with so cilicient an instructor
as ’l‘. I“. H. Candlyn. Special men-
tion should be made of the ardent
work which Mr. Candlyn has done
with the orchestra. College credit
cannot be secured after two years
work with the organization.

This year the members of the or-
chest‘n have numbered twenty-seven
pieces, including piano, violins, ban-
.ioes, viola, cello, flute, cornet, and
saxophone. Those who are not al-
ready members and enjoy concert
music are asked to come and bring
their instruments and enlarge its
numbers. Those who do already be-
long do not need to be urged to come
next year.

The president for the year 1923-24
was Ruth Ellis, ’24. The oﬂiccrs for
the ensuing year will be elected at
the beginning of the semester.

 

lNTERCLASS RIVALRY

Every year the freshmen and the
sophomores indung in good‘nutured
rivalry from the my beginning of
the year until all scores are settled
on Movmg-uplDay in the spring.
College traditions are respected by
the entire student body and are
guarded carefully by each and every
student in the college“ Wise iii the
lreshman who early finds out what
rules the college has laid down for
his observance in company with the
e .oi' her children or for his own
special observation and obedience.

'l‘he lnterclnss Committee on Rules
(“)23) has made the laws, on roved
by Myskanla. which govern al class
rivalry between freshmen and sopho-
mores. ' ’l‘liere is no form of inter-
class rivalry permittedi now except
the organized class contests, which
are to be carried on under the super-
vismn of one or more members of
Mysknniii and which are outlined in
section IV of the code on lntcrclass
Rivalry Rules A point system has
been Worked out and the score is
kept and announced on Moving-up
Day by a member of Myskunia.

'l‘hese organized contests include:
all Campus Day activities, basketball,
baseball, cageball, challenging, hun-
ner l'l\’llll'y,.niil'SCOiJ hunt, and Movmg-
up Day actiVIties.

Campus Day activities include ath-
letic «wants for the men and the wo-
men oi the rival classes and com c~
titire stunts. The lreshmen nien p ﬂy
the sophomore men in basketball
thine tunes; the women of the rival
c ' compete in basketball accord-
ing to G. A. A. schedule. Victory in
either case is 2 points a game. Cage-
ball and baseball games for women
will add '1.- point to the score of tin.-
winning team’s class, while the class
having the greatest per cent of mem-
bers present at these games will re-
ceive l point. One class must chal-
lenge the other to (l) a sing or (2)
a debate during the first two months
at the second semester. Victory
means the addition of 2 points to the
winner's score. The banners at the
rival underclasses may be honestly
stolen, (Each class must have one by
December l, for the rivalry cannot
begin until both classes have n
banner).

The women guard the banner first
semester; the men the second. Inter-
tcrence on the part of the men dur-
ing the time the women have the ban-
ner, or vice vcrsa will end this rivalry
and give :3 points to the class against
whom the oil'cnse was committed.
During the first full week in May,
the freshmen hunt the sophomore
mascot which is hidden somewhere
on the Campus or in the Campus

     

 
 

buildings. Victory here is 5 points.
The night before Moving-up Day,

there is a tug of war for women
which counts 4 points and a banner
ash for men which counts 5. The
sings on Moving-up Day night and
the aggregate points earned by either
class in the athletic events of the day
are added to the score.

Rivalry begins ordinarily after the
Get-Wise. Party which the sophomores
give the freshmen before November
first and ends automatically on
Moving-up Day, when the sophomores
become juniors and the freshmen
sophomores with the burden of show-
ing “the next year’s freshmen, the

 

way to go.”
