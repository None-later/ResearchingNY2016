dered distinguished educational or

The annual meeting of this iissociie
tion was held in the college, June 14,
at which time there were class
reunions, a banquet and numerous
activities.

About l'our years ago the first of
the local alumni asociatioiis was for-

MUSIC ASSOCIATION

In closing the second year of its
vistencc at State College the Music
A soctation would like to bring a few
tact. to the attention of the college,
and attempt to clear away a mis-
understanding that 'ts in the
minds of many of the talents.

The misunderstanding is concern-
ing Music Association and Music
Chili. Every student who pays his
lilanket tax hclongs to the Music
.-\ssoenition. it is the orgniiimition
which lirings on the concerts that
have been presented during the
winter. It is an organization of the
entire student: body, so far as that
body has shown its loyalty to its
Alma Mater by paying its tax.

0n the other hand the Mt
is eomnosed of some seventy
students who take a special iiite s
in music. The club meets iii-monthly,
and members of the chili l‘urnish the
prog'aiiis. Any one may belong to
the club who pays the annual dues
ol‘ twenty-livi- i s.

'l‘hen there is the Music Associa-
tion t‘ounril. 'l‘liis is made up of
I'ive studenls elected annually by the
music club, with Dr. ’l‘homnsnii and
Mr. (‘ainllvii as faculty members.
'l‘his eouncil ol' seven people directs
the all'airs of both the Music Club
and the Music ‘<(I('lllll(lll. A lllI'IlL

they gave this year has been

by the .  tion appropriation. In
addition to these there were two col~

and a i , 'tal by Miss Helen 'l‘honip-
son, a steil hy Edna Shal‘ei‘.

Besides all this, through Dr.
Thompson’s etl‘orts, the Association
has been able to give the students

have been held in our auditorium.
