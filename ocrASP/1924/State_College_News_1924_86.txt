thereby more on the personal sensi-
bilities of the student, than on the

faculty.

The change to go into eil‘cct at
State next September will also ail‘ect
not to as great degree the majors.
Notable reductions in the number of
required subjects will be marked in
the science departments, chielly Phy-
sics and Chemistry.

Another feature of the new cata-
logues will be regarded in the mas-
ter‘s requirements. Holders of bach-
elor’s degrees from other institutions.
who work for their master's degree
at State College, will not be required
to take as many courses in Educa-
tion as heretofore, providing they
have had the requirement for their
bachelor’s degree, similar to the re-
quirement at State. This new sys—
tem, Dr. Brubaeher avers, will allon
graduate students to pursue more
courses in their special subject.

STATE COLLEGE PRESIDENTS

The story of State College is in-
complete without the story of that
line of sturdy, stalwart educators who
have sat in the executive chair and

in their wisdom guided the policy of.

with the work of the principles of

QUARTERLY SHOWS
PROGRESS FROM
DAYS OF “ECH "

The Quarterly is the literary ma *-
azine of State College. it is an out-
growth of the “Echo” which was a
literary-news magazine that flour-
ishcd for ten or twelve years. In
1918, the first Quarterly appeared.
It began‘ and it continues, as a liter-
ary magazine only. Stories, essays,
plays, and poems are solicited from
students and interested alumni. Mom
bers of the faculty contribute articles
from time to time. The magazine
appears four times a year, and is
issued to all students who have paid
their student tax.

’l‘he editor —chiel‘ for next year
is Ruth Moore.

 

Places on the board are the re-
wards of merit. Each year, the

Quarterly Board announces the con—
ditions on wh'eh the competitive
try—outs depend and election to the
board are based upon the quantity
and the quality of the manuser’pts
submitted.

On Moving-up Day the Quarterly
Board awards a. prize of f'teen dol-
lars to the person who has contrib-

uted tinI best composition to the
Quarterly during the year as i
prize of ten dollars for the .ieond

 

best manuscript submitted.

BENEFIT T0 MANY
STUDENTS THIS
YEAR

'l‘he infirmary privilege is one of
the advantages State College oil'crs
her students through the eeope‘ative
action of the students themselves. A
two dollar tax, included in the stu-
dent tax - levied upon every individ-
ual the returns of which are pooled,
and pl’accd at the disposal of Dr.
Croasdale, who has authority to semi
any student in need of medical atten-
tion to one of the Albany hospitals.
Expenses are defrayed or lessened by
a twenty-iv: dollar payment from
the infirmary fund.

Those who know ihe expense of a
college education can appreciate what
such assistance may sometimes mean.
The infirmary privilege has relieved
more than one student from a sud-
den, and what might have been an
over-whclming burden.
