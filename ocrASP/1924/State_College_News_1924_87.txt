We may have a chapter immediately.

course in Liberal Arts. However. ac-
cording- to a new l‘llllllL',‘ which
divides the country into five districts.

thirds the chapters of her district.
Since our district is composed at
New England. New Jersey, New
York, and Pennsylvania. a pro-
posed chapter at State would neon

lished chapters to be recognized. It
is improbable that this will ever
happen as the purpose ol‘ the ruling‘
is to make it diﬂicult for an Eastern
college to enter the A "ociatinn. We
are not, alone in this .iositioa, but‘
have as associates srch institutions

 

as Mt. Holyoke. St. F‘coplien‘s College,
