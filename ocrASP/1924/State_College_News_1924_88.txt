These courses are closely allied to

character of art periods, thru a study ‘
of the valuable Visual record of their

BIOLOGY

'l‘hursilay. May 2.0, saw the lockers
emptied, slide s rubbed for the last
(or was it the ist) time and a few
remnants of cover clasSi returned
to the supply table. it saw three
hundred or so yous persons passm:
out anil healing: with them “Care—
l‘ully bound and indexed," somewhat
sonauinary note books containing-
more or less remotely usable infor-
matioii——-which we hope is not en-
tirely concealed within. More ini-
portunt than this, howe , we trust
that they were also car v' '
them open minds, ohseivations a
little keener than before, joy in the
contemplation of livin" thing's, so
alike in their physiological processes
and yet so different in their forms,
their adaptations, their reactions.

’l‘hree introductory courses have
been given, simple courses, requiinnc‘
little previous preparation. Gene al
Biolocy was oll'ered for students who
intended to go no further and wished
some knowledge of botany and zo-
oloc‘y. liJlement'iry courses were al '0
oll'ered in General llolany and Gen-
e'al Zoology, designed to acquaint

’iliesi- courses have led to more ad~
ranccd work in these respective sub-
jects, with more emphasis on the in-
formational side. li'our cour '

'l'huse who still survived the period
of" rigors of laboratory routine were
rewarded in their senior year by the
courses in Evolution and Methods of
'l‘eachine'.

The identification course was not
given this year. owinp; to the almost
superhuman task of finding a plum
for it in the schedule. This. we feel.
has been a decided defect, for if
there is one thine; needed above all
others by the teacher of biology it
is a first hand knowledge of his ina-
terials, not in the desiccated, pickled

 

and sectioned state. but healthily
alive in their natural environments.
'I his delliciency has been partly rein-
edied by a series of voluntiry field
trips. conducted by members of the
department. Of these we hope to
have more next year. Plans are now
beine‘ made (“Hope springs eternal")
for two field cours-s. one in Identiti-
(‘ation of ’l‘rees and Shru‘ '. eiv. n in
the fall and early winter. and one in

CHEMISTRY

Chemistry in its origin was prob-
ably an Egyptian art. its history
may be traced through many nations;
about the time of the French ltevolu—
tion it was called the French Science;
later it became German. The neces-
sities of war, however, again changed
its course. and it is now becoming
American.

Chemistry was a bulwark between
civilization and (ierman domination.
lt served us well in war, iind peace
was hastened uuite as truly by Amer~
ican chemistry as by American
troops.

The oliices of chemistry in peace
are less spectacular but no less vital
than in war. A nation that witholds
its appreciation and its development
of chemistry is ill titted to compete
industrially with its more progressive
neighbor.

it is probably true that the chief
diil'erence between ancient and con-
tempo‘aneous civilization is the "
ence of the isent. Man is prob-
ably iiot superior in intellect. art or
civilization to the man of ancient
Greece or Rome. lie is. howcvi-
more comfortable and he lives loncc
'I‘hroue‘h the product of the test tube
and crucible he now may enjoy the
luxuries of the ancient royalty, and
countless more then undrcamod of.

 

 

 

   

However for this science extends.
and it enters into every factor of life,
it begins in the school. The pupil
may never become ii chemist, but
the quick perception and recognition
of a chemical iroblcm is quite as im-
lportant to he business man or
iwoman ll‘l its subsequent solution by
,thc trained export. With an clo-
lmentiiry knowledge of chemistry, one
lceases to be a patron of fake hair
ircstol'e proprietary and expensive
lcosme synthetic l‘oods, fat re-
.‘nioyers. strength builders and similar
nostrums.

An appreciation of these vital
ip"ooleins of life (tomes through par-
’ticipation in chemistry, not in obser-
svation of it. Participation in chem-

Much new equipment has been
added in the last year. including

lchincs, and an Edison-Dick Electric
iltotary Mimeoe'apb. Other equip-
iment will be added this coming year
‘which will make this department a
well equipped department for com»
imcrciai teacher t‘ainine'.
i The demand for commercial
ttcachers has always been strone'. The
supply has never kept up with the
demand and no field oll'crs better op-
portunities to the progressch tcucher
than that ol' busine . Nearly one-
third of the hig'h school pupils in

Zpartm at, and added to this is the
 nc' number of working boys

 

. incri.
'and girls who attend the continua-
ltion school commercial department,
‘thus increasing; the opportunities of

lthose who are preparing for this
i phase of education.
This demand for commercial

lteachcrs also has had the cfl'cct of
icnablint: the new teacher to start in
jllls or her work at a relatively high
isolary. 'l‘he salaries of those gradu—
‘ating‘ this June 'ane'c from $1,300
Lto $1,500 which IS relatively high for
:strictly classroom teaching:

The department aims to meet the
needs of those students who have had
no previous commercial trainingr as
.wcll as those who are graduates of
yhlg'h school commercial departments.
.’l‘hc latter group are not required to
take over strain the technical com-
mercial subjects, but elect in place
jol‘ them from a‘y department in the
