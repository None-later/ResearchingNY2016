The Household Design Glass have
an opportunity to prove the unifying;
inﬂuence of pitan plus enamel on
furniture. The subjects for their
work were the pieces of a bedroom
set belonging to the Home Manage-

wore made to get the chair arm
mended by a professional. But it
was discovered that professional chair

solve that problem. which they did
by usine: reeds of the type for has-
