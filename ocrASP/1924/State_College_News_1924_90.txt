of these languages as it a.ins to
ciuatu .in apprccnition of the literary
value of, old Greek and itoiiiaii

in the field of liloi'atuie as it was lig-
uratively ti'iio years ago, for Home is
on: source of all culture, a culture on-
riched, and relined by its coiiLaCt

classics, then, gives us information in
regard to the origin and setting of
literature in its primitive stage, as
Well as furnishing us valuable his-
torical knowledge of those early
times and peoples. ’l‘hese classics
me rich in humor, beauty, and the
philosophy of. life. as certain oxt'acts
from Horacos “Odes” or Cicero’s
"De Senectute” prove. 'l'o trans-
form these ideas into a language of
many later generations without iii-
jui'ing the beauty or losing the
thought content of the original, thus
gaining knowledge of ancient litera‘
and its produc -rs and incidently
standing the technique of that
literature is the aim of the Latin and
Greek Department. Works from
Xenophon, Pluto, l‘luripidos, Cicero,
Horace, Virgil, 'l‘acitus, Catullus.
Lucretius, and other noted authors
are read by students majoring or
minoring in tho classics.

have achieved excellence rarely nt-
tninod by iunuteur organizations.

SPANISH

Among the inte' ‘ting courses
offered by the Spanish department
are: ii course in South American
history, a study of the Spanish
poetry of South America, a course in
Spanish literature, and a Course in
conversational Spanish.

The Spanish club is one of the
most active departmental societies in
College, of which the Spanish Caiu
nival, given under the auspices of tin-
club, is a. witness. We rather wonder
if something of the clmriicteii'tic
Spanish cleverness and g'acel’ulness
is acquired by the members of tin-
club through their study of the na-
lion’s song and dance. One would
think so. judging from the delightful
exhibition they give every spring.
