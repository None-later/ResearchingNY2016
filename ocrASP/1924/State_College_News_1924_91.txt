PHILOSOZ’HY

'l‘liis department aims to presnnt
instruction in the main subjects us-
ually classed as pbilesopliiail, includ-
ing psychology, which. althe not
strictly philosophical as treated, is
nevertlii-less a precondition of all
philosophical pursuits.

The aim of philosophy is a rational
and systematic comprehension of ex-
periei and reality. it seeks to
tra 'end the knowledge of the
special. sciences, and to unify ainl
emulate all ‘knowlc-dge; it aims at
universal liilel'positive principles, at
final truth and reality.

 

 

Aesthetics sveks a philosophical in-
vest) atieii of the science of the
beautiful. We here make an inductive
study of art, including sculpture,
painting, architecture, music, and the
drama, with the ell'ort' to reach piiil-
osophic principles by which all art is
to proceed and he ele'ated.

 

it is a highly enjoyable course.

Ethics is a study of the funda-
mental principles ol' the moral life.
A study is made of the p'actical
mo 'at life and institutions, with a
final deterniinatiim of the principles
upon which the science rests, Ethics
crowns every problem of life, and it
is hard to conceive of a more import-
ant field of study,

Epistemology and Metaphysics may
be called the two hemispheres of phil—
osophy. in every experience we hziv
the antithesis of thought and thing,
knower amt known. These facts
pr iit the two perennial problems
of philosophy; the problem of know-
ledge and problem of reality. ’l‘hcse
subjects furnish the respective goals
of all philosophic thought. They
furnish the student a world—view un-
attainable in any other way.

  

The history of philosophy is the
history of human thought, a
history that should transcend in inter-
est all other human achievements.
We here follow the course of anc'ent
Greek thought through its marvelous
development into its flowering cut
mination in Socrates, Plato, and Aris-
totle.

We become familiar with the spirit
and method of the middle ages ,and
finally with the sweep of modern
thought which has culminated in the
tenets of our own day.

The courses in philosophy in them-
selves, wlien thoroughly mastered,
