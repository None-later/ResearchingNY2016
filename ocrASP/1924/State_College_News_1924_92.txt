HISTORY OF STATE COLLEGE

in lfilii a Committee of the Class
of Jobs on Publishng a Weekly Col-
lege Newspaper took the first steps
toward establishing a weekly paper
at State College. The aim of the
newspaper as they stated it was “to
make each faction of our student
organization know and appreciate all
otht s. to uphold the maintenanCe oi‘
fraternal regard and friendly rivalry
among all. to work for co-operation
between all sections and for thesoiidi-
fication oi.‘ the now separately wasted
energies in the promotion of a real,
distinct and enthusiastic spirit of
loyalty to State College."

When college opened again in
1917, the News began to appear each
week. The work was under the
direction of Alfred Dedicke who,
with a committee appointed by Pro. '-
dent Brubaeher. began the publis
ing of State's first newspaper. The
people who worked with Mr. Dedicke
were: Dorothy Austin, Stanley
Heason, Eloise Lansing, Lillian Ma—
gilton. Joseph Walker. Henry Green-
blott, Kathryn Cole. Mildred Me
Ewan, Benjamin Cohen. Roy ’l‘own-
send, Maud Rose. l'llmetta Van Deloo.

With the initiation of the Student
'l‘ax plan of financing student enter-
prises the financial troubles of the
News disappeared, for the students
have each year voted their paper a
liberal appropriation. With the ad-
ditional help from its subscribers
outside the immediate student body
and the zuivertiseme t‘ the Business
Manager am] his ants obtain
each year, the News tznances have
become the least of its troubles.

When the war came, the News
Board was so broken up by the en-
listment of its members in service
that Myskania had to appoint a new
Many of the appointees had
been enthusiastic workers for the
News since it was first started. They
included Lillian Magilton. Kathryn
Cole, Mildred Mclilwan. and Stanley
