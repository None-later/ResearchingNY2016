Riz Reports Condi-
tions in Europe

Adua Wood ltisley, professor of his—
tory, who has been absent on sabbatical
leave for a year, returned to college a
week ago, following fifteen months' ob-
servation of the l'liiropean situation, dur-
ing which he traveled in nearly every
continental country, besides England, and
northern Africa.

Returning to State ('ollege probably
one of the best informed men in this
country on European affairs, outside of
the state department, l’rofessor lx'isley
will use his first hand knowledge in his
lecture Courses.

Most iinporiant among his many im-
pressions he believes are these:

iinrope will go to war again in twenty
years,

tiermaiiy's spirit is broken, biit only
temporarily.

Austria is “out of it."

The United States is one of the very
few it'iinitries in the world that really
teaches and preaches ideals.

lint this is not. the lCuropean interpre-
tation of this country. liiirope still
thinks We are dollar Chasers.

The American newspapers are the
only ones in the world that really try to
educate the

(fonllciting r: ideas, backgrounds,
customs. languages, and, most impor-
taiit, aspirations, preclude posmbility of
permanent peace.

"he llawes plan is the best possible
solution for Cerinany economically,

The United States must not get iii on
the next liiiropeni catastrophe which
will come before 1945

Professor Rislcy sums up the entire
iiiropean situation in this manner:

" Europe is today sick of war,
hoping for peace. but every country
that can is arming to defend herself
and preparing at top speed for an-
other contlict, "be common people
in all nations do not want war.
iliit. they haven't the say. And—
if the common |lC’l|)lC want some-
thing and can't get it Without war
they will want war and they will

get it. The Dawes plan, if followed

will save Germany. But it may

foretell the return into power of .1

Germany that does not believe she is

responSIble for the last war. Today

the nations are too weary to ﬁght.
llot they Will not remain so long."

CO-OPER-
ATION

'l‘hroiighout the past four years the

a tablishinent in I920 it has striven to meet
l as nearly as possible all the needs of the
icollege students. These students, all of
, whom have had occasion to profit by the
facilities it offers, must realize how use—
, fut aiul handy a book store run in con-
, junction with the college is. Do they also
jreahze that the “t‘o-op" faces a debt,
due to student mismanagement? Do they
,kiiow that the advantages and aceoinmo—i
ftlillllillﬁ derived from such a store almost

became a thing of the past? Alllllilltl
ithere are hopes of recovering from the
pre no financial deficit through faculty
supervision, whether or not the store site-
ceeds depends to a vast extent on the
co—operation and support of the sndent

,body. (Io’operatc with the “ Co-op,"

;new rules of conduct which have been;
devised: I

Trustees Pass Reso-
lutions

The faculty and student body of State
('ollege are grieved to hear of the death
‘ Miss liraiieist'a l'. Martini-z in Mary
li‘lelcher Hospital, iliirlingtoo, VL, on
August l2, after an illness of three
weeks which concluded failing health
for three years. M iss Martinez, had been
for several years instructor in Spanish
and supervisor of teaching in State ('oi—
lege, and for the past six y she had
been a member of the . paiiish facility
' the summer session at Midiltebiirv

, t'oilege.

Miss Martinez was born in San Juan,
l’orio ltieo. When a cliilil she Wrote to
President Roosevelt who made arrange—
ments for her to come to this country.
llet‘aiise her guardian did not think it
advisable to come at the lime her youth-
fnl plans Were not .t-ali/ed. Later,
however, she came to America for her
education. Miss Martinez was grailu»
ated from Syracuse University in Into
with the degree of A. ll.

Iiiineral scrviie were held in the
Methodist Church of Middiehiiry, l\’t'\'.
l’.. W. tiotild ofticiatiug. liurial was'in
the college plot of the West ('emetery.

The lloaril of 'l‘riistees have thus ex-
pressed their appreciation of Miss Mar—
tinez: “Miss Martinez was a rare per-
m. She made devoted friends of her
talents and had made friends of every
one oflher faculty associates. \Ne learned
to respect her for her fidelity, her gen-
erostty, and her loyalty. She was a
teacher of unusual skill and gave her
best to the State (.nllcgc for ’t‘-achers.
Her passing is a great loss to the colle"e
and to the cause of modern language
teaching."

FRESHMEN HIGHLY
INTELLIGENT

Registration this year totals about the
same as last, between l.0(l0 and 1,100
students. This, Dr. llriibachcr says, is
250 more than the buildings were origin—
ally planned for. The freshman class
he believes, after consultation with the
psychology and education departments,
is slightly higher in intelligence than is
usual, since it represents the one—fourth
of the applicants for admission who were
able to gain entrance. Twelve hundred
and ﬁfty applied for admission. ix
hundred could not satisfy requirements
or made other arrangements. Two llttll‘
dred lacked one or more required sub-
jects for entrance. The remaining 150
had studied the right subjects, but did
not hold high enough averages. The 340
students remaining form the class of
