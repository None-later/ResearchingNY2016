DR. BRUBACHER ADDRESSES
STUDENT ASSEMBLY

A direct attack upon the proposal to
weaken the powers of the Supreme Court
of the United States as “extremely
radical " and an appeal to “the intelli-
gence of the American people to over-
whelm the proposal once and for all "
were made by l’resident llruhacher ad-
dressing a crowded lirst session of
weekly chapel last liriday.

llr. lh'ubaeher gave the entire chapel
period to patriotic. observance of (.Ton-
:titution week. l‘lxalting‘ the position of
.he teacher as a gnardiatt of the consti-
tution and therefore of national security,
he argued that education is primarily a
l’tlt‘. rather than a national or municipal
function. Upon education. he declared,
tests the responsibility for the "public
opinion of the next fifty years," and he
'iointed out as illustrations of the weight
of education. the effect that warlike
teaching- has had upon the German peo-
ple. and the prohihition amendment of the
l'oz'stitntinn.

llr, trnharher defended the principle
of representative government. declaring
that " if our reprtwentatives do not truly
represent us. it is our own fault."

DRIVING

“('oming down to e' ' again " is no
hardship when it pronn. s the green of
linglish hedges long grown into firm
softened stone walls
as guides to one's roadway. Over two
thousand mile‘ of English scenery in-
cluded many kinds of beauty,
quite different from those of ottr own
latul. 'l‘he thatched stone cottages helped
us to think in terms of eeuturie. instead
of decades: the remote churches. the
cities' great cathedrals. atul the great
ruined ahheys gave the reverence of
beauty. At Chester and York old walls.
and in many places Roman traces. re-
minded us of the many strains which
have clashed. mingled, and lasted to give
tr‘tain its variety. yet ttnity rooted in
tradition.

Often we longed for the power of a
good American car. but our l. )
“.lane“ (he'anse an Austin—spelling of
family names is variable!) took us mer»
rily along the good. though narrow and
little—traveled roads. in the woodsy
parts of llevonshire hundreds of fox-
gloves hent a deep pink salute. Hairpin,
turns and steep. rocky hills brought us
to Kim: Arthur's country. where 'l'in—
tagael headland “o'erlooks the sea that
ever sounds in Merlin's cave." Donne
Valley is a peaceful enwrald. no longer
enarderl by outlaws. liefore we saw
King Alfred's Wantaue. or Oxford. and
Stratford. we had ridden through the
trentler heattty of llerkcshire "downs
(rolling country), and the delightful
surprise of Cheddar Gorge—cliffs grow-
ing ever loftiei; but without, decorated
all the way up 400 feet of gray rock
face with clinging ferns and other bean-
tifnl hits of green. and within. hiding
the fair carving and stalaemite-hnildint:
of underground rivers that paint in
tawny colors.

Reading will tell you of the pearl-like
clouds and purple lieiirhts (though per-
haps not of the stone fences which climb
ocrnendicnlarly to the ill|)“- of l-lelvellyn
and its neighbors!) around the famously
lteautifnl lakes of Westmorelaud and
Cumberland. and imavrination will pic-
ture quaint Canterbury for you. so l'll
