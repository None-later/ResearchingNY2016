registration for the college year ’24-’25
which has exceeded 1,050 and will un-
doubtedly reach eleven hundred with the
incidental registration of the second
semester, President liruliachct' has made
the following careful geographical sur-
vey of the state as represented by the
student body.

By class the registration is thus dis-
tributed:

It is interesting to discover that every
county of the state with the exception
of Hamilton County, is represented by
one or more students. Albany County
with naturally the largest representation
is followed in order by Schenectady and
lx’ensselaer. which may he called the
Capitol District counties. It is also
noticeable that counties as far distant as
Suffolk, \‘VCSlCllt'SiCl‘. Orange. and
Dutchess are each represented by more
than twenty students; and that the west-
ern part of the state sent an unusually
large quota this year: Cattaraugus.
Steuben, Monroe. tierresee, Niagara.
Cayuga, Wyoming, Wayne, Chautauqua.
Livingston. Ontario. Alleghany, and
Schuyler counties, lntttllllg one hundred
students. Representation by counties

The above total indicates almost an
equal distribution between village and
rural communities on one hand and
cities on the other with a balance of forty
for the latter.

Such a study forcefully demonstrates
that State ('olh-ge is in the best sense a
statewide institution both as regards its
tunlergraduates and its alumni, who, it
has been ascertained. are at work in every
city, village. and rural ttonunuuity of
New York.
