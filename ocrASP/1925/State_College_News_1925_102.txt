'I‘he worth of a college education

ance to those who are planning to
spend four of the best years of their
lives in an instiliition of higher learn—

capable as lidisnn disclaims the value
reaped from sticli an education, college
students feel puzzled and uou-plnsi-d.
An education cannot be separated
from the individual who is pursuing it,
and on that individual rests the worth of
the education. ‘or is the gain secured
by the individual to be alone considered
but one must also take into account the
effect on his crnltciupurai'ics and his off-
spring. tour years of college does
not take one a few steps nearer to per~

religious faith, and in ability to be of
service to the wurld then we might say
