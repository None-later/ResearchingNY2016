Professor Risley spoke of a remark—
able, coincidence which he had had on
November II, 1918. Professor Risley
was on the entertaittment committee 0
the University Club, which ltad procured
Monsieur Stephan Lausautte, then head
of the Committee on information, as a
speaker. The date set was November
ll. Monsieur Lattsanne, editor of one
of tile most influential .lt‘reuch news—
papers, the "Paris Matiu,” arriveti at
the club; garbed in his beautiful, blue
uniform. iit' set-med’lo typify the French
victory, as he stood up to speak.
murmur began to be heard around the
room until it ﬁnally burst into a roar—~—
every man was on his feet yelling at
the top of his voice. It was a spec—
tacular performance! it was November

Professor Risley,had the opportunity
to have two interviews with Monsieur
Lausaune while he was itt I‘aris.

Last November ll, while in Paris,
Professor itisley watched the colonial
troops march, through the Arc de

dignity American feeling plan-d a
wreath upon the grave. The most spec-

cuiiar music of the flutes of the
Moroccan troops.

NEWS URGES CO-OPERATION

it is only through the cooperation
of an entire student body that a col—
lege paper can he representative of the
ideas and aitns of that hotly, What the
paper really is depends altnost as
much on the students themselves, as on
the hoard running the paper. Here at
State, the college paper is rtttt by a
hoard of editors, reporters and cubs.
Each week assignments are given to
the reporters attti cubs. If they are
alive and wide awake, without doubt,
they will bring back something in
shape of news, but often even the best
of them fail. Often they have done
their part, and tltcn where does the
fault lie? It most often lies with the
student or organization to whom they
are sent for news.

Tite editors are trying to make the
“News” as representative of the stu-
dent body as possible, anti the way in
which the students and organizations
respond to their appeal for cooperation.

Y. W. C. A. Enjoy
Lecture

Rachel i.. iienfer, instructor in a
Kentucky mountain mission, addressed
lilt' V. W. C. .‘\., at its regular meet-
ing. 'l‘uesday, November it. Miss
lteufer, with her low Southern drawl,
immediately won the interest of all.
ller speech opened with a few personal
references. treating her experiences
when she, as a young college gradu-
ate front \‘Vasitington, became all in-
structor of the “po'r white trash."
"The novelty," she stated, "was what
lirst attracted me, lntt soon, [ learned
to love my work because of the help
i was giving others."

The girls wltotn Miss lieufer teaches
she divided ittto two classes; iiIUSCl
who come front the poorest eountryi
mountain sections and those from the‘
mining towns. The former are of the
lowest of the white trash| unkempt
and tttterly illiterate: the latter, al-
though better clothed are far from
ordinarily well-versed. “It is our
task,” Miss licnfer stated. “to teach
them the lirst rudiments of education,.
for few can either read or write—mot?
do they know anything of the funda-
mental laws of life. Our range of in—
struction includes religion. morals.
manners, and the laws of health."

In closing, Miss ilcttfer congratu-
lated Statt- students for their choice
of the most worthwhile of vocations.
“And I know where-of i speak, for
I have bad experience." she added with
convincing emphasis.
