WALKER TO Noted Impersonator To Appear In Albany;
Ruth Draper At Chancellors December 6

BE DELEGATE

To Seek Legislation

For Dormatories
Professor Adam W'alker. of the
Economics department, will be the

faculty delegate to the assembly of
the delegates of the New York State
Teachers' Association, to be held in
Chancellors’ Hall. November 24. lm-
portant issues will come up for con-
sideration, among them the report of
the committee on ’l‘cacber Recruiting.
of which Dr. llrubacber is chairman.
The committee will make the fol-
lowing specitic reeommeudations:
(a) “That adequate dormitory fa-
cilities he provided by the s ate in all

 

teachers training institutions main-
tained by state funds to house all
students in training. Student life In

 

segregated private houses. such as is
now forced upon all New York State
teacher training institutions. is cheer-
less, unattractive and barren of all.
those social byproducts which makel
American college life so rich and Ill-i
tractive. Dormitory life under the
guidance of cultured and reliued social
directors would improve the quality
of our teacher training. Opportunity
for the development of the social
graces must be offered as an induce-2
meut if the normal school hopes tol
attract the best type of student.

(bl “'l'hat legislation he sought
from the State Legislature of 1925. for
purposes of dormitory construction:
that the appropriation be on the basis
of $l,000 per student. to be housed in
the State College for Teachers, and
the normal schools of the state. It is
estimated that 3.000 such students are
now improperly housed.

2. That the university scholarships
now maintained by the State of New
York, he made available for students
who attend the normal schools. It
is believed that the dignity of teach-
ing demands that the normal school
student should he placed on equal
terms with the college student, and
that the same scholarship system
should apply to both."

And you think you never can choose

There's one thing will save you yet.

What’s that one thing? Y. W. C.
A. Christmas Bazaar, to be held Dc-
cembcr S, from four to eleven, in the
gym. It is the big chance to buy
almost all your Christmas presents.
and at the same time. to have a jolly

It can be done at this bazaar. There

Ruth Draper

'l'ln- liramatit's and .\r1 ,\~~'ocialion
of State College will present Ruth
Draper at (.‘hanecllors' Hall. on De-

cember 6. 'Miss Draper is known to
many of lhc sludan of State ('olli'ur

since she gave .t recital here in l‘L’Z.’

The real beginnng of Miss Draper's
career was in her \ery early childhood
when her father or mother would say,
"Ruth. give your recitation for Mr
and Mrs. " Miss Draper can—
not remember a lime when she did not
have a “piece” to speak. As she grew
older, she added to her repertoire,
l'Icr sketches always h: ': been. and
are now. of her own creation

Finally things reached the point
where she was called upon to recite

 

that you'll want to keep for yourself
or to give to your friends.

Even enjoyment creates an appetite.
so at 5:30 and at 6:30, supper will he
served in the cafeteria. If you were
at the Y. W. supper last year. you
will need to be told nothing about
this one. except that it will be just
as good. If you were not, there is
no use trying to tell you about it.
Just come—and taste.

At 8:30. there will be an entertain-
ment. What? That's the deep. dark
mystery. All the committee will say
is that there will be outside talent, and
college talent. that it will all be
highly talented. and that you’ll have a
good time. Then there will be time
back in the gym again. to buy the
things you forgot before, and to eat
a. little more candy, before the fatal
Hour of eleven.

Can you resist such a program? Of
course not. Don’t forget—Friday,
December 5. from four till eleven, in
the gym. the cafeteria, and the audi-
torium. Tickets will be on sale Mon-
day. Buy yours early.
