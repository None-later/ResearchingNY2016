o’clock. From the lirst few minutes
of play, the contest was hard fought
and exciting. The action slowed a
bit after the lirst goal, but regained
momentum in the second quarter, and
moved swiftly to a whirlwind finish.

celling in working as a unit. Both
teams were so well balanced and in
such good form that the game set a
record for tense moments.
