' SILVER BAY CLUB ACTIVE

‘ The. Sliver Bay Club took charge

mg told of meetings, lectures, and: dis-
cusston groups. Georgianna Maar

Mock Trial Proceeds;

Hutchinson 0n Bench;

"Secret enemies who are afraid to
come out in the open" are at the back
of the $25,000 "heart balm" suit ﬁled
by Miss Bernice Quinn, '26, against
Lyle Roberts, '25, football captain.
Roberts charged yesterday in a (Ir.-
matic interview with newspaper
writers.

“It's a plot to ruin me politically,"
the athlete declared.

Asked if it is true that he told
Miss Quinn “he could live without
food easier than without her," Roberts
said: r

“It's a lie. I never said that, if
they think they can do me for $25,000,
which I don’t possess, they'll ﬁnd out
they‘re wrong. If I didn't think there
was more justice in this country than
that, I'd move to Russia."

The trial moved rapidly in govern-
ment class, with Professor Hutchison
on the bench this week, and is ex-
pected to end to-day. The court
ordered the room cleared of all except
members of the class. to avoid danger
of a mob attack upon Roberts, by the
crowd which became infuriated as
more and more details of evidence
were uncovered by the prosecution.
Roberts preserved an outward silence
as witnesses piled up accusations
against him last Friday and Monday.
Except for occasional nervous bitingr
of his lips and profuse blushes, he
gave little sign that he heeded the
proceedings. He sat in an obsequ
corner.

Miss Quinn was visibly affected as
her friends told of what the prosecu—
tion branded "Roberts' shameless
periidy." She secured on the. verge of
an emotional collapse several times.
Roberts avoided her gaze and when
their eyes (lid meet occasionally, be
ﬂushed deeply and attempted a sickly
smile.

The prosecution introduced corres-
pondence alleged to have passad be-
tween the principals. it endeavored to
show this bound Roberts to marry
Miss Quinn. The courtroom was con-
vulsed in laughter as the most intimate
communications were read by Adrian
Johnson, counsel for Miss Quinn.

Judge Hutcbison several times had
the room called to order.

Defense and prosecution organized
its forces to-day for the dual act of
the tense drama. Miss Quinn. it is

 

 

court life. The meeting closed with
the conference song "Follow the
Gleam;" accompanied by Mrs. French,
an active member of the Y. W. ad-
visory board, whose kind welcome
and hospitality to the club was much
appreciated.

Johnson, her attorney, until an early
hour this morning. Early to-day a
throng of curious who have followed
every detail of the trial, gathered about
the government class room. -
Surprises are expected. It is said
that the defense may call Dr. George
A. Painter, mental expert, in an effort
to prove that Roberts has been suffer-
