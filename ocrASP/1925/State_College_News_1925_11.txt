The Famous Farrar
To Deliver Talk Here

Joint Farrar, playwrite, poet, and
editor of "The Bookman," will give
an informal talk Saturday evening in
the college auditorium upon the sub-
iect of the modern play and modern
play production. Mr. Farrar has the
advantage of personal acquaintance
with the famous and illustrious of the
day. which in itself promises a delight-
fnl inside glimpse of the character and
lives of outstanding contemporaries.
Very likely he will touch upon his own
recent experiences in New York play
production. Whatever he presents,
one may feel assured that his talk will
have a wide appeal, whether or not
one is up to date in theatre—going.
