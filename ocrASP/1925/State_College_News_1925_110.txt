RUTH DRAPER
READS HERE

Known from Coast To
Coast As Dramatist

Miss Draper, who is to appear at
Chancellor’s Hall on December 6, at
8:15, is a granddaughter of Charles
A. Dana, who was Assistant Secretary
of War under Lincoln, and the well
known editor of the Neiv York Sun.
Her father. William ll. Draper, who
died in 1900, was a distinguished phy‘
sieian. and her brother is Paul Draper,
the concert singer and vocal teacher.

From her grandfather, she must
have inherited much of tiie wit and
wisdom with which her sketches
abound, while her dramatic'genius
may be traced to the famous Journal-
ist's wife who, it is said. was possessed
of line histrionic ability and had. aspira-
tions for the stage.

Many of the newspaper critics of
New York and elsewhere, where Miss
Draper has appeared, in commenting
upon her exceptional powers of muni-
cry. her astonishing versatility, and
her inanysided talents, have expressed
wonder why she does not identify her-
self with a regular play. She did make
one attempt at it with Marie Tempest
in “A Lady's Name," but to be sub-
servient to the dictates of a stage
director, did not appeal to her. She
preferred a career where her indepen-
(lencc would enjoy the fullest scope
and give her individual standing.
Evidently. her achievements have ac-
complished that purpose. »

I'ler overwhelming success is one of
the most remarkable ever known in
:lmltSCliiL‘tlt ‘annalﬂ l-ler triumph in
London, followed by a genuine ova-
tion in Paris, was regarded as a dis-
tinction never before won by an
funeriran artist. She even went a
step further when she presented her
original character sketches to equally
enthusiastic audiences in Madrid. At
a time when America was marvelling
at the reception here of two companies
of Russian players, lx’uth Draper, an
American, was carrying American art
to the most famous capitals of Europe.

lirom coast to coast, her character-
izations have been given, and \vhcther
in Chicago, Boston or Philadelphia,
she has been cordially greeted by
capacity houses. No longer is she
considered a monologist. She ranks
with the foremost actresses. In New
York City, her Sunday nights at the
Selwin Theatre became an institution
and her houses are invariably sold out
in advance. Such attendance is
awarded only to artists who have won
and held popularity. Her character
sketches are not merely monologues.
She presents and enacts little cameos
of characters that one minute hold
the audience tense in pathos, the next
moment laughing at the foibles of
easily recognized society types. Her
characters are perfectly wrought; each
one lives. There is a subtle quality
of ﬁnish about her art or work which
stamps it as the work of an artist who
loves her art.

Miss Draper is at present publishing
a series of her monologues in the

every assurance that 1925 will see the
foundations completed. The granting

Legislature has been accepted in edu-
cation circles as indication that the
remaining appropriation for the build-
ings will be given.

Creation of two new professorships,
six new instructors, and live new
assnstant instructors, is also asked in
the request Iiled at the Capitol. Total
salary increases for the faculty of

A STORY WORTH TELLING

In announcing the publication of
“The Story of State," the News calls
to the attention of the student body,
the history of its Alma Mater. one in
many respects, notable and unique.

State College has 'had a brilliant
record of service in a field of education
where service counts for most. It
has always led and still does lead in
training teachers in New York state.
it approaches the completion of four-
lifths of a century of that service, the
state's largest and oldest unit iii
teacher training. ,

The completion of eighty years of
expansion marks-also the beginning
of an era of increased prosperity.
With one-third of the goal for the
college's dormitory reached, a'grcat
step toward social unityyis made.
With deﬁnite assurance by the Presi-
dent that work on the foundations for
the three building addition, to double
the institution’s capacity will be
started before 1925, the future holds
forth a vision of a student body that
will. in ﬁfteen years pass 't e two
thousand point.
