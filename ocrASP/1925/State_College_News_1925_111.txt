noble cause, but we are to become or-_.

dinary human beings who delight in
living. and working with other human
beings. The term "teacher" no
longer means a he~spectacled. long-
facerl individual who is afraid to smile.
It means an individual who is not
afraid to live, that is, to live his best.
We teachers, then, are not to be
placed in a box labeled with "Take
every day except Saturdays and Sun~
days—and be thankful for small favors
like vacations .and week-ends." We
are to stand forth, uncategoried and
unlabeled. We are to be individuals,
and not :1 species of microbes. Teach-
ing to us is to be a vital vocation, and
not a side track where we may park
until a marriage offer comes along.

statement, then, “let us strive on in

these lines. The problem is:

of the freshmen, asked :1 series of
questions in relation to rooming

what are you doing in make it so;
have you a convenient [)'act: for your
books and papers; do you have to
share this place with others; have you
a suitable table or desk; have you suf—
ficient light (both natural and artiﬁ-
cial). quiet conditions, fresh air,
warmth, and a comfortable chair, all
which are necessary for successful
study?

Dean Pierce will make use of the
statistics received from the answers to
these questions to help the students,
and she will have a talk with every
