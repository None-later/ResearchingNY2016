UNION WINS;
LAW SCORES

State Meets Defeat
As Bravely As Ever

State College basketball team in the
ﬁrst game of the season lost by a score
of 33 to 15 to Union College in the
State Armory. Saturday night.

With nearly eight hundred present,
State presented genuine ﬁghting spirit
and evidence of hartl training. Union,
by its brilliant defense, defeated many
of State's attempts at scoring. State,
nevertheless, by forward passes and
long shots, succeeded in making eight
points during the ﬁrst half. The re-
maining few minutes of the last half,
State with renewed ellort made the
Unionitcs pay for nearl ycvcry basket.
As the whistle blew at the conclusion
of the game. State made its ﬁnal
basket, raising its points to a total of
ﬁfteen.

On Monday night, State again lost
to the Brooklyn Law School by a
score of 40 to 23. Again State met
with a defense it could not break. In
the ﬁrst half State was unable to
handle the faster men from Brooklyn.
Its old spirit was there, but it was not
used to the manoeuvres of its oppo-
nent. In the second half State rallied
once more. Nephew starred, making
several throws directly underneath the

basket and otherwise makingr possible

a better showing for State. Brook-
lyn fouled at the curling of the game
and Nephew threw the ball that raised
State's score to 23.
