‘PROT‘ECT‘ REPU’ITAINON
OF STATE

Unfortunate little inridents have oc«
curred from time to time which makes
us wonder whether State College will
ever be ready for an honor system. We
talk of traditions and honor, of respect-
ing others’ rights and trusting one an—
other—anti then something happens
which proves to us that our talk is of
no avail. Lockers have to he locked
and purses miraculously disappear, it
is unfortunate that, through the actions
of a few individuals. the reputation of
the college in general suffers. The oh
adage that a chain is no stronger than
its weakest link might apply here. The
student body, as a whole, wants State
College to be vital in all its parts, and
surely, it will do all in its power to see
that “the chain has no weak links."

“THE STORY OF ST.\’l‘I£"

Four-ﬁfths of a century of progress.
from a normal school to a state college.
will be ended by State College, Thursday.

A student body which has grown from,

29 to 1.050, and which may expand to
2,500, if the new building appropriations
are granted by the state, will witness the
progress of those eighty years. To-day
the News begins “The Story of State,”
:I 9an of Iiiosceighty years. Those who
wish to learn about the humble begin-
nings from which the Alma later
sprung, should not fail to read it.

ART ‘LECTURE EDUCATIONAL

An,art lecture. on the making. of

different kinds of etchings, was givcnr

to—day In assembly, by Miss Perine.
The talk was based on the exhibition of
pictures hung ou' tlie'walls in the
rotunda, for the last two weeks, and
was illustrated by lantern slides.
