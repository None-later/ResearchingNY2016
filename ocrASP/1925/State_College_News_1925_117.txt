Has whoever threw a monkey wrench
into the machinery of Bernice Quinn's
romance with Lyle Roberts relented and
begun pouring lubricating oils-on the
troubled waters of their friendship?
Was tiie "victory" gained by hired serv-
ants of the Roberts' millions last. Friday
in the $25,000 “heart balm” suit wan
only to be lost by the rebirth of Roberts'
alleged interest in the beautiful junior?
Is it so that Roberts wants to marry
the girl who sought to mulct him of
some of his family‘s vaunted wealth with
himself in the role of a cat’s-paw?

I‘o-day it was charged that the
Roberts family's pecuniary influence had
not been entirely quiescent during the
development of the trial. Adrian
Johnson, counsel for Miss Quinn, who
professes to know nothing of the
rumored romance, indicated that evidence
of corruption among at least two of the
Jurors is in his possession and that he
may dcmand a retrial. Failing in that,
he indicated. he may carry the case to
a higher court.

Found last night, Roberts declared
that, rumors to the contrary, “everything
is off between me and Bernice.” He
refused to enlarge upon his statement
and would not discuss whether he had
communicatedwith Miss Quinn since the

ma.

Told of the whispers regarding a re-
conciliation, Miss Quinn said:

“The next person that mentions Rob-
erts' name to me is going to be obliter~
ated. He is out of my life forever.
The trial has shown there is no justice."

It was a scene of pathos and of near-
tragedy that marked the last day of
the trial. Spectators, reporters, camera~
men, were crowded in the courtroom.
all eager to learn whether the yawn-
ing maw of prison gates would swal-

years had been spent in the atmos-

cold, austere, his gaze keeping silence in
the ribald crowd. Within the railing
were the attorneys. Godfrey, skilled in
defending rich malefactors, methodical,
imperturbable. His manner gave little
warning of the emotional storm which
was to sweep the jury off its feet, aided,
as it is now charged, by greenback ar-
guments. A yard away sat Johnson,
just out of law school, a young man on
his ﬁrst real case. At his side and fre—
quently engaging in whispered conversa—
tions was Miss Quinn. Roberts was
late arriving. He came into court wear-
ing a» gray lounge suit, a blue necktie.
and blue hose. His attitude seemed
changed as he awaited the ﬁnal plea from
that which he had earlier assumed. He
affected a bored air and seemed only
mildly interested while newspaper photo-
graphers took ﬂashlight pictures of him
lrom several angles. This was managed
by permission from the court who also
consented to let the jury pose.

Godfrey threw logic to the winds as
he launched into his ﬁnal efiort for his
client. Disregarding Roberts‘ riches he
painted in heartrending terms the story
of his early struggles for an education.
He dwelt upon the prisoner's extreme
youth. He told how he had once been
awarded a prize for attendance at Sun-
day school. He ended his appeal amid
sobs from the women among the spec-
tators and the nine lady jurors. He
quoted several stanzas of poetry, and
when the sweet chimes of‘tltc period hell
put an end to his discourse, he said:
"We rest our case."

That was Wednesday. Friday came
the verdict. Roberts was free. Day
before yesterday came Johnson’s charge
of corruption. Yesterday brought the
story of the rebirth of the blighted ro-
mance. Will to«day hear the sound of
