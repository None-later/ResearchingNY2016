than it has boasted for several seasons.
In (iainor, .‘ilattt has a center who can
outjump anybody who has yet been
encountered in the pivot, posttpius of
opposing teams. Kucxynski and
Nephew. who played at forwards lit
the early games, have been fast enough
to pile up points in both games. llmu
utility forward, was used at
guard in the ﬁrst two games and
worked well. In Johnson and Juckett’,
State has two former varstty basket-
ball captains and guards, Juckett‘ hav-

{STATE BEATS

Vincentian Institute Has Been Secured ST. MICHAELS

Ruczynski—Stars For
State, Score 23-16

A Purple and Gold whirlwind, with
Tony Kuczyuski at the bellows,
swooped down upon St. Michael's
College from VVinooski park, Vermont,
Saturday night, and brought victory to
State College by a 23 to 16 score.
The game was played before a capacity
crowd in the college gymnasium.

Coach llakcr's revamped team, com-
ing through for the first time this sea~
son. ran away with St. Michael’s, its
traditional opponent, building up a
fourteen point lead in the first half and
,piling on the tallies in the closing
lpuriod. State closed the game with
ttbt‘ee freshmen on the floor.

‘ With Nephew, forward in the Union
and Brooklyn Law games at guard
, and Hornung, utility man, shifted from
:guard to forward and the rest of the
lline-np intact, Coach Baker sprung a

 

‘surprise on the fans and the Ver-
‘Inonters‘,
'l‘ony Kuczynski, a freshman for-

ward, did most of the scoring. The
l'nlish star, totalled 13 of the college's
points. Nephew. the second freshman
on the floor, held his man scoreless
and caged two I): "-ts. Griffin, the
third freshman, sent into the game in
tlornung’s place at right forward in
the closing minutes, made another,
and ('aptain (lainnr scored twice, once
from the floor and once from the fif-
‘teen font line. Johnson, guard, play-
.‘ing Boiselle, St. Michael’s star, ac-
{rounted for the other point.

The game started in good tempo and

'ftvr five minutes State was playing
laster than any time before this sea-
'l'bt- passwork, weak spot of the
game Monday night, was .t sensation.
Late in t|.r- second half the Ver-
moutrrs‘ rallied temporarily, but the
l'v'rplu and (iold stopped the rush and
,started its scoring again.
l l't-rotta of St. Michael's opened the
‘eaine with an L basket and Mei/U—
pine, Captain, god a free throw.
lx’uczynski 'tbcn made a sensational
shot one-third the length of the court.
tiainor followed with another and the
lt'illll had full sway until the half when
the score was l7 to 4, Koczynski hav-
ing come through with four more
lields.

During the opening period and later
St. Michael’s substituted frequently in
an effort to stop the {low of points.
Nobody went out of the game on
either side on personals.

State scored first in the second half
when Nephew pulled down an easy
one after a longr dribble down the

floor. Kuczynski followed it up and
then Perotta came through for the
opponents. Boiselle scored twice in

succession and a moment later sent
the sphere through the basket for a
third, making two fouls in addition.
Grifﬁn broke the visitor’s streak
with a neat shot and the game ended
a few moments later, the score 23 to 16.
