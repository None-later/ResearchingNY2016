POINT SYSTEM EXPLAIN'ED

Due to the fact thatthe‘re seems to

ie ' ‘ ‘ " u as to the count-
ing 01 a D toward graduation, the fol-
towing explanation is offered: .

The number of credit points in the
major or minor must be equal to qr
greater than the number of credit
lIOlll'S, .

'l.'hc giving of credit points is as
follows: '

A—3 points for each hour.

tl~—2 points for each hour.

C——-l point for each hour.

Thus a student receiving a D in his
major or minor must receive an A or
t in acourse givini.r the same inun-
her of hours in the same department
to offset the D. ‘

A l) received in any course other
than a major or minor may he otlsct
by an A or i! in any other course
' ins: the same number of hours.
.n‘oyided that at the time of graduation
the number of credit points equals the
number of credit hours.
