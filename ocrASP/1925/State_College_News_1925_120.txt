S. N. K. ABOLISHES HAZING

Believing that the day of hazing as
a means of initiation into college life
has ' I, members of Sigma Nu
Kappa have voted to join the nation-
wide movement among,r the leading
colleges and universities to substitute
a more civilized form of fraternity
ritual. This year, for the first titer
in the history of the fraternity, Sigma
Nu Kappa will not subject the fresh-
man members to the customary phy—
sical initatiou. A new form of initia-
tory exercise has been arranged anrl
will be established as a precedent for
the future.

The motion to abolish hazing was
not. carried without opposition. lt
excited considerable argument. On
its final vote, however, it was accorded
unanimous approval by special motion.
Members of the fraternity believe that
the new ritual will make for more
loyal support and will tie the frater-
nal bonds closer than the antiquated
method of hazing.

To top oft this year's induction of
new members, Sigma Nu Kappa con-
(lucth a theatre party at Harmanus
Bleccker Hall, Wednesday night.
December 17, which was attended by
twenty student members and two
faculty members.

MUSIC 'RECI'I‘AL SUCCESSFUL

A memorable concert rendered even
more enjoyable by the personality of
the artist was the pianofortc recital
given by Ossip Ciabrilmvitsch under
the auspices of the Music Association
in Chancellor’s Hall, Friday evening,
December 12.

The famous pianist captivated the
entire house by his masterly rendition
of a program which included mnnbers
troni llandel, Mozart, Bach. Bee-
thoven, Chopin. and his own compo-
sitions. lf‘relimilutry to each of several
selections, his comments on the works
of the great masters and their inter-
pretation were instructive as well as
thoroughly enjoyable.

The entire program was character-
ized by the strength and brilliaucy of
(iabrilowitsch's technical perfection
and by the beauty of his interpretation.
The Beethoven sonata, Op. 27, No. .
was given superbly and proved to be
one of the most popular numbers.
The Chopin ballade, nocturnc. and
raise were also brilliantly rendered.
(lalu‘ilowitsch's melody and his
sprightly eaprice-burlesquc completed
the scheduled program. The Music
l.‘\ssociation certainly scored a distinct
triumph in offering this concert to
Albany.

THAT'S GOOD—GO 0N1

A lighting team wearing the Purple '
and Gold of State College was victori~
ous Saturday night. State College
broke into the winning ranks after
two losses, defeating St. Michael's
while almost four hundred students.
crowding the gymnasium, cheered the
live on.

The college was proud of the team
Saturday night. and to-day it is no
less pleased with the victory. Prophe-
sics of a stellar team, lavished by
sports writers since the flue showing
made in the Union game. have become
partly true and before the season ends
will be definitely proved right.

Coach Baker and his team have de-
servedly won the college's praise.
State did not hesitate to cheer a losing
team in the closely fought Union and
Brooklyn Law games. It did not
hesitate to applaud a winning squad
Saturday night. And. many times
again before the season ends, it will
cheer another victory.

A year and a half ago. just before
the late President Harding died in
San Francisco, he said to his wifeas
she paused in reading aloud to him:
“'l‘hat's good, go on." Today State
College says to its winning team. in
praise for the past and confident hope
for the future "’l‘hat‘s good. go on."

REV. DUNNEY ADDRESSES

 

The Quarterly Conunnnion of New-
man Club was held Sunday, Decem-
her 14. at the 9:10 mass at St. Vin-
cent de Paul's Church. A breakfast
followed at the Academy of the Holy
Name, At the speakers' table, Senator
William 'I', liyrue, ltcv. Joseph E.
Dunne-y, Mrs. Newman, and Miss
Mary Driscoll were seated. Miss
Driseoll, President of Newman Club,
introduced the guest of honor. Senator
ltyrue. who presented a memorable
speech. his topic dealing with the
religious element in true success.
Senator Byrnc said in part: "1 do
not believé there is any success in life
unless we are constantly appreciative
of the Power that gives us success.
in this country of ours, there are
marvelous opportunities, but the basis
of accomplishment is religion. Never
let us be pleased with our self-sufﬁ-
cicncy. our present day attainments.
There is always an undiscovered way
to a new thought, a new ambition, a
new reality."

In behalf of Newman Club, Rev.
Joseph E. Dunney, Spiritual Director,
expressed his appreciation of the
honor of having Senator Byrne pre5<
cut on that occasion. Father Denney
also spoke of the present day tendency
to draw away from Christ and from
religion and of the absence of that
Spartan-like element of religious per-
severance which characterized the
pioneers. Another very enjoyable
part of the morning's program was
the piano solo by Agatha Flick, '27.
