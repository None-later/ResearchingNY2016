STATE COLLEGE NEWS, DECEMBER 19, 1924

 

80 Years Ago State Opened To Students;
Registration of Twenty-Nine Pupils

STORY OF STATE
Part 2

Yesterday, eighty years ago, State
College opened its doors to New York
State's students. Yesterday, in 18-14.
its ﬁrst class matriculated. How this
and other early classes lived and
worked is an important phase of the
mass of facts surrounding- the college's
history.

It will be remembered from last
week‘s article that after years of agi-
tation New York had voted .1 normal
school and what preparations for its
beginning had been made. When the
day came for opening exercises, Dc-
cember 18, 1844, twenty-nine students
were there. Most of them were from
the Hudson and Mohawk valleys but
some came frqu farther away. Up
State street they came to what is now
Van Vcchten Hall and on the thirt
ﬂoor where Beaumann's Dancing
Academy is to-day they discovered
their school and their principal, Dav'
Page, and the little faculty. They met
the ﬁrst board of trustees and they
attended the opening "exercises."
Principal Page made a speech and
Colonel Young made another.
Colonel Young, who was president of
the trustees, said that he believed that
nobody there realized how much the
occasion signiﬁed and that few would
attempt to say to what heights the
school would grow.

That same day, for they wasted no
time, the ﬁrst classes were begun.
The twenty-nine pupils, forebears of
the present 1050, went to their ﬁrst
lessons and the next (lay they went to
them again. In a week the school
was getting into the swing of real
work in the four rooms on the top
ﬂoor of the old building.

Rented rooms, however, were not
in the plan of the men who were run-
ning the school. Attendance that
jumped to 150 before the end of the
ﬁrst year, for so fast the story of the
state's normal school spread, made
more room essential anti the teachers
went to the legislature again, this time
for money for a building. From the
city of Albany they secured free a plot
of ground at the corner of Lodge and
Howard streets back of the Geological
building. On it for $15,000 they had
erected the building that was to be
theirs for thirty-six years. It still
stands and is used for education by the
Christian Brothers. Two sets of plans
for the buildint.r were considered.
One, lllt‘ old report says was the
more ornamental and cost $700 more."
This plan was adopted. In 1849, the
rapidly growing institution was trans-
ferred to this building.

F.

 

Principal Page never saw the new
building. He died in 1848 and his
cousin, George R. Perkins, who taught
mathematics, was ehosen' to succeed
him. Mr. Perkins served three years.
While he and his successor Samuel
B. Woolworth were in charge, an
experiment in the education of Indians
was tried. inc were admitted in
l850 and in three years, live Indian
men and twenty-one Indian women
were students. Only one was gradu-
ated and the experiment was dropped
as a failure.

During the Civil War, David H.
Cochrane was principal. It was at
this time that State made its ﬁrst
large contribution to the country's
welfare. Professor Alfred Hucsted,
who was a member of the mathematic
faculty, resigned his position and or-
ganized a company of volunteers made
up entirely of the college students. He
marched at their head to the war.
One hundred and ﬁfty-three alumni,
in addition to this company, were en-
rolled iu the Union armies. Eighteen
were killed; ten in battle and eight
dyingr of wounds in hospitals. Pros
fessor Huested survived and returned
to the college faculty where he later
became head of his department. He
served in that capacity for thirty years
longer.

(Sidelights on amusng incidents in
the college’s early work and the story
of the ﬁrst great change in its pur-
pose will be related in the third article
to he published January 16.)

ART LECTURE
Miss Perine, of the Art department,
gave a most interesting and instructive
lecture in assembly last Friday, on

 

etchings and how they are made.
She described ll] detail the various
methods of making etchings. There

were to have been lantern slides to
illustrate her talk, but due to some
mishap they were not able to be used.
Among the etchings which Miss Per-
ine showed were many of her own.
She called the attention of the student
body to some of the best known
artists of to-day, such as: L. Benson,
Barton, G. C. Wales, (1. T. Plowman.
and William Simmons. orks of
these artists, besides those of many
others. have been on exhibition in the
rotunda for the past two weeks.
