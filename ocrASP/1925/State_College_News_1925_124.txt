1925

.\ new year lies before State (Sol;I
loge. Just recently we celebrated our:
ieightieth anniversary and reviewed,
the progress which our college has!
made, Perhaps in the year to conth
we shall see a progress even greater
than the :progress which has been
made in the past eighty years.

if this seems impossible. remember
that in 1923 it was believed that Ill:
science the highcst'progress had been
made. but in the year l02-l a greater
advance in science was attained thanl
had been made in the past ten years.
So, in the year l925 we can expect
great things from State College. Dor-f
mitories, inter-collegiate games, and
the honor system; these and many
more projects may be realized~whol
can tell?

Myskania represents the honor andl
hiin scholarship of State College—tel
them we must look for leadership.
The various clubs represent the spirit
and friendliness of State College—to]
them we must look for inspiration,
Our team represents the courage of.
our college—even in the face of de-
fcat. With all these to aid us who
will doubt the future?

But the future success does not rest
entirely in the hands of our leaders;
it lies mainly in the hands of the
pupils. Work and cooperation on the
part of the students counts III the end.
No college ever reached its goal. unless
its students entered into its desrre and
ambition with all their hearts and
might. . ‘

All our hopes he unfulﬁlled for I925.

-—let's make them come true!

EVENTS AT STATE '

Four big events of the season face
us within the next two weeks; the
elementary dramatics class plays. cx-
aminations, the Junior Prom, and
the Junior Luncheon. The January
plays scheduled for tomorrow even-l
ing at the Vincentian Institute, willi
l the product of two months of,
strenuous labor, both on the part of'
the director and the cast. They are
one of the two big dramatic portrayals
of the college year and Saturday‘s pr0-:
ductiou will be on a par with, or per-.
haps surpass, former productions.
Miss Futtcrcr's ability in directing andi
an excellently chosen cast merits :1,
even approachingi
mid-years should not cause to be
empty. They are an examination in‘,
themselves in that they are a test of.
our ability to appreciate good drama.‘

. Moreover. State College students are

to be admitted on the presentation of:
their tax tickets, so the expense is no‘
bar. If you are a bargain llllnlcl’,‘
come and see these plays for which.
the public is willing to pay severity—

As to the examinations, our attend-

Even a good program at the "Capitol "
cannot interfere with them; we might‘
say with the noble six hundred that.
it is "ours not to reason why, ours
but to do or die " for the next two
weeks.
