i Piercing the Great Divide

The General Electric Com-
pany includes many special-
ists-wengineers who know
about tunnels; engineers
who know about street light-
ing; engineers who know
about the electriﬁcation of
factories. These men are
helping to build the better
and happier America in
which you will live.

electricity is doing, write

GENERAL ELECTRIC
FACULTY LOYAL

The Residence Hall Committee has
just received a good—sized check which 1
represents the net proceeds of an!
evening of readings given by Miss!
Futterer in Poughkeepsie, during!
December. This was given under the‘
auspices of the Hudson Valley Branch
of the Alumni Association, George

 

Schiavone. '20, president, and Mildred
Carswell, ’l9, treasurer.

Printer: of State College

West of Denver is the Continental Divide; hemmed
in behind it is an undeveloped district twice as
large as Maryland. That fertile area the new
Moffat Tunnel will open up.

General Electric mine locomotives are carrying out
the rock, and G-E motors are drivingr air compres-
sors and pumping water from underground rivers.

The conquests of electricity on land and sea, in
the air and underground, are making practical the
impossibilities of‘ yesterday. It remains only for
men of ability to ﬁnd new things to do tomorrow.
Thus docs Opportunity of 1925 beckon college men
and women toward greater things as yet undreamed,
and to a better world to live in.
