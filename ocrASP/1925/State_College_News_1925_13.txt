Against Alumnae

The annual Alumnae-Varsity game
of January 31. offered the lirst oppor-
tunity for State to View the girls' var-
sity in actioit. That the game was
closely contested is shown hy the linal
score of 18-16 in favor of the varsity.
Despite the fact that close guarding
and hrilliant shouting featured the
match. the game was slow. due to the
constant shifting: of positions on the
varsity.

The alnnmae played a better organ-
ized game than is usual. llilda Lio-
heeh, '24, crack 1) vat of last season's
squad, usually succeeded in getting
the tin-rill and passing the hall to the
forwards. llelen Walsh. ‘22, rolled
up all the points for the Alumnae.

Margaret llulchins, captain of the.
varsity. shuttled her players in an at-i
tempt to try out immihli‘ cnnihiuatinm
for the running: mmhat with it’nswll
Sage. This constant rhanut- in iillt'llil
which kept down thr- \znwity‘s nmrr.
is shown hy the illll'llll.

\Vinning the West

Irrigation by electrically driven pumps has made
hundreds of thousands of acres of desert land in the
Intermountain West blossom like the rose.

For a few cents a month per acre, electricity—the giant
worker—brings the life-giving water from distant lakes
and rivers to rainless valleys, producing rich harvests
of fruits and vegetables, cereals and forage.
