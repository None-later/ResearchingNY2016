DII’LOMAS AND EDU l:\,’i'iON

Now that liiial examinations are
past aitd a new semester is opening.
such remarks as these are heard in
college corridors. “ is Professor X
a good marker? Can you get by with
much in his courses? 1 registered for
this class because i hear you can pull
a passing grade withottt the slightest
effort." Of course we take such re-
marks with a grain of salt. for they
are largely hyperbolic, but the fact re-
mains that most of us, who are striv-
ing to secure a college education. seem
to he more interested in the hours
easily secured than the general infor-
mation gained. if securing an educa4
tion is reduced to a game of chalice
where the student risks nothing, and
reaps a piece of paper known as a
diploma. then an education is worth-
less. Crannning a lot of useless and
desultory knowledge in our craniinns.
and then expelling it hurriedly into
examination booklets, is futile effort
and wasted time. Unless we aim to
broaden our intellectual horizons. un-
less we take thr e conrsus which will
better develop us to meet and solve

 

 

the problems of life. our degree is not ,‘

worth the letters that compose it.
And so, in making' out this semester's
schedule let us choose those courses
front whiclt we shall derive the most
benefit, regardless of the work iii-
_voived.

POINT SYSTEM EXPLAINED

Due to the fact that there seems to
)C ' ‘ ‘ " u as to the count-
ing 0. a D toward graduation, the fol.
towing explanation is ollcred:

The number of credit points- iii the
major or minor must be equal to or
greater than .the. number of credit
flollrtl.

’t‘lic giving of credit points is as
follows:

A—3 points for each lionrt

[3—2 points for each hour.

C—l point for each hour.

Thus a student receiving a i) in his
major or minor must rec ' e an A or
l iii a course giving the .anie ninn-
her of hours in the same department
to offset the i).

i.) received in any course other
than a major or iitiiior may be offset
by an A or ii in any other course
offering the same number of hours.
provided that at the time of graduation
the number of credit points equals the
number of credit hours.
