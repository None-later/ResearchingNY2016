of January 31, offered the ﬁrst oppor-
tunity for State to view the girls' var-
sity in action. That the game was
closely contested is shown by the final
score of 18-16 in favor of the varsity.
Despite the fact that close guardian
and brilliant shootng featured the
match. the gallie was 51va. due to the
constant shifting of positions on the
varsity.

ized game than is usual. Hilda Liv~
