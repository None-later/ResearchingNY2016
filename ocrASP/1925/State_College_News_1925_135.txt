ATHLETIC WORK COMMEND-
ABLE

'f‘he work of the varsity basketball
team this season has been gratifyingIr
to the college. At the present time
the team has played eight games, and
has won three of them. line (H the
games have been played in Albany.
and in its home court the Purple and
Cold stands with three wins against
two losses.

Admittedly. this is a good record
it compares very favorably with that
of the last two years. It has brought
a revival of (‘OllllthllCC both from the
college and from the general sports
world. With four more games to play
the team should bring in two, possibly
three, more victories.

The team has met reverses. Since
the St. Michael's game Johnson has
been kept .rom the squad by illness.
In the three weeks before the end of
the season the varsity has a right to
expect every support from the college.
Cheerng should be better than it was
at the lumni game. Attendance
should be better. The team practices
faithfully, its schedule has been well
chosen and it works hard in all its
games. Its support from the student
body should not lag.

She never to herself hath said.
I'll go today to buy my “ Fed,"
And when its pages I have read,
