his listeners with his superb renditions.

artist. evokes a most luscious tone
from his inslrunn-nt and what is more
has an impeccable technique.

If you write a play. don't put it in

would he apt to believe that you had
written a masterpiece. It is better to
take it to a literary critic at once, and
told out that you haven't. Then for-
