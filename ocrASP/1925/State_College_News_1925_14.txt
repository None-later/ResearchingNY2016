ATHLETIC WORK COMMEND-
ABLE

The work of the varsity basketball
team this season has been gratifying'
to the college. At the present time
the team has played eight games, and
ha: won three of them. bin: or the
games have been played in Albany.
and in its home court the Purple and
Gold stands with three wins against
two losses.

Admittedly. this is a good record
It compares very favorably with that
of the last two ye' ‘. it has brought
a revival of eunlidmee both from the
college and front the general sports
world. With four more games to play
the team should bring in two, possibly
three, more victories.

The team has met reverses. Since
the St. Michael's game Johnson has
been kept train the squad by illness,
In the three weeks before the end of
the season the varsity has a right to
expect every support from the college.
Cheering should be hotter than it was
at the Alumni game. Attendance
should he better. The team practices
faithfully, its schedule has been well
chosen and it works hard in all its
games. Its support from the student
body should not lag.
