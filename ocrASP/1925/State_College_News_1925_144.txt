WASHINGTONE
OUR HERO

Lecture By Risley
Broadcasted by WGY

“Washington is our national heri-
tage," said l’l'ofessoi' Itisley at the
ev'ning services of the liirst I’resby-
terian (fhurch, Sunday evening, lit-b-
ruary 22. liroadrasted from station
\VtiY, Schenectady.

't‘he cherry tree and hatchet story
may he traced to the \\'l‘illllt_';s of tht
parson, Sleenis, a writer during
Revolutionary times, Professor ltisley
said that, of course, Steenis liked or-
nate phras'es better than facts, but
Washington, even as a boy, was too
much of a farmer to cut down a
cherry tree. However, if Washington
did not wield the hatchet, l‘rofessor
Itisley used it to advantage in his talk.
The legendary hatchet figured in every
phase of \Vasliington's life.

The hatchet was first used by \Vash-
ington to cut through the forests on
his expedition from \\’illiainshurg to
Lake I? ‘ At Great Meadows he
won his first victory.

"The hatchet," continued l'rofessor
ltisle)‘, “had a keen edge. lt rnt.
\Vashington could say things to the
point, and sharply. yet his reprimand
to Arnold was clothed in the gentlest
terms.

The hatchet struck to the heart of the
tree when \Vasliiugton spoke on the
matter of patriotism: ‘Meu may
speculate; they may talk of patriot-
isni. i know patriotism exists,
and I know it has done much

and lasting war can never he
supported on this principle alone, It
must be aided by a prospect of interest Ii
or some reward.‘ " t
Washington served his country ini
five distinct \vz : first, as a colonel
in the lireneh and Indian wars: sec»
ond. as a helper in developing the
l'x'evolutionary philosophy; third, as
commamler-in-chief of the Revolution—
ai‘y forces: fourth, as a great moral
force in the Reconstruction period;
fifth, as a builder of a new nation.
"\\’.'ishington," said Professor Ris-
ley. "was very human. He swore ap-
propr.tel_v, he flirted, he danced. lie
ln't'd and rode horses, he was an out-i
of-doors man. and a boy scout.” in
conclusion, Professor Risley quoted a
paragraph from C, H. Van Tyne:
"As men looked back over the years,
of strife, they saw clearly that thcl
chief reason why the American cause
was not lost liefore li‘rance came to
its aid was the personal leadership of

it was not his great mind, for Frank-
lin's was greater; not his force.

ties; not his military experience. for

but it was the strength of character
which day by day won the love of his
soldiers aml the perfect confidence of
