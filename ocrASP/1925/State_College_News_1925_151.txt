[SLZONSlN U, long; itt tth lore—
lront of state edncatinnal institu-
tions and now in search of a new presi-
dent, is being slowly starred to death by
the state authorities who rnntrnl its
purse strings, according to charges ol‘
some of its aenlty. .\ie:tnwhilt- the
Wisconsin legislature is apprrmriatitn;
millions for disposing of tuhercnlar cow:
and for other purpnsei; whirh the
seholastics see as far lc“ important titan
maintenance ol‘ the hie, state institution
for the education of its youth. Sumo
thing like a parallel to this may he found
in New York State. As t‘restdenl l‘n‘n
hae 2r showed in his animal report, the
state spends the and nne~hall times a.‘
much money to educate a student of \‘l'l'
crinary tuedirine as a school teacher.
and three and onerhall taut-s as much
to train a forestry student as a student
of education. l’recedini; legislatures
