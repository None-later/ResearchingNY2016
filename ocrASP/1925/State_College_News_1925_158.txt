()nt- kiinl of person fascinates inc:
the person whose simplicity and seem-
ing niiivete paradoxes, in this day of
--ophistication, extraordinary knowl-
edge and wisdom. Having, tlicti, con-
sciously recognized in that philosophy
’I goal oi attainment, I hav- naturally
wondered how college afft- it.

liveryw ' the common criticism
of the collt, e graduate is “he knows
too much." We pa‘ it by lightly,
telling ourselves individually that a
proper pt-ispective of the unattainable
vastness of knowledge has gi en its
a proper humility. What we fail to
set: is our propensity to me sure our-
sclvc' not with the immensity of the
tnii U! c. bttt with the smallness of
our a‘sociatcs: and. finding otn own
abilities tip the balance, to puff up
ourselves with pride. That is my
greatest cril' ‘m: we fail to iiiain<
tain an intellectual equilibrium by a
high standard of compa .o .

There is in this reg: rd another
fault found the world over, the fault
of "a little knowledge." The criti-
cism is not applicable 'o freshmen and
sophomores alone that religion l5—-
