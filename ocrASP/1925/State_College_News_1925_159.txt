SUCCESS ASSURED

Albany will be able to raise its $150,-
000 share of the Residence Hall fund,
according to the belief of Charles Gib-
son, vice chairman of the campaign
cmnmittee. Mr. Gibson sailed for
Europe Saturday, but will return to
Albany before the i‘aiiipaigii ends.

“l am certain," said Mr. Gibson,
“that Albany will see its duty in this
matter, and work and give for the
erection of the Residence Hall. It has
been a source or continual regret to
Albanians that the girls who are to
be the teachers of the children of the
coming generation in New York state
should be subjected to the tribulations
that await so many of them when they
come here to attend college.

As I look over the calendar t
seems to me there will be a continu-
ous campaign in Albany from now
till mid-June. lint of all the objects
none is more deserving than State
College.

“I am told the Residence Hall will
be both beautiful and useful, that it
will be provided witli every modern
convenience of light, air, aiiil comfort,
All of these things should be at the
disposal of these young women who
come here as gutsts of the state and
of the city.

With Albany giving $150,000 or
more, and the alumni atlding $150,000
more to the $l00,000 already raised for
the $400,000 Residence Hall Building
Fund, it should not be very long before
we can point with pride to another
achievement in the Capitol District."

The church cooperation committee
has been organized and conducted its
first meeting Monday in the form of a
dinner in the Fort Urange Club. The
Rev. Dr. Roclif H. Brooks is chair-
man, Assisting him are the Rev.
Dr. \Villiani Herman Hopkins, the
Rev. H. G. [laganian, the Rev. Rich-
ard l3. Locke, the Rev. C. IE. Frontz,
the Rev. Charles S. Hager. Rabbi Mar-
ins Ransom, the Very Rev. Charles
C. W, Carver and the Rev. David Lee
jamisou.

The purpose of the committee is to
obtain the active support and coopera-
tion of all Albany churches and re-
ligious societies.

Methods of procedure will be
discussed and it is expected the
committee will choose a Sunday
during the intensive period of the cam-
paign from May I5 to June 8, when
the campaign may be announced in
churches.

By unanimous agreement the board
of directors of the Albany Chamber of
Commerce, at its most recent meeting.
approved the coming campaign.

The resolution said:

Whereas. the New York State Col-
lege for Teachers has made an excel<
lent record as one of the leading insti-
tutions of the east, and

Whereas, its alumni, 0\ er a period
of years have been most influential in
tl'- se movements tending to the
growth and iipbuilding of our various
communities, ant

Whereas. the college is both a cul-
ttiral and business asset in providing
free tuition and expending approxi-
mately $1,000.0th yearly in Albany. and

Whereas, the alumni are now engaged
in raising a $400,000 Residence Hall
Building Fund to construct a students'
dormitory, so urgently needed prop-
erly to house girl students under
favorable social and moral conditions.

Be it therefore resolved, that the
Alhaiiy Chamber of Commerce heartily

 

.endorse and commend this movement

to the public as a worthy object and
express to the Residence Hall buildi-
ing funds its desire and willingness
to cooperate in every possible way to
make the movement a signal success.

C II C lling
()U'I‘llAlJ. will be dropped as a
sport at State next fall. The Ath-

letic Council has not acted on the
question but the opinion of the col-
lege's leading athletes is that con—
iiniiaiice of inter-scholastic football in
September will be unwise. The need
all along has been not for better men,
but for more men so that two teams
each with a string of substitutes can
be maintained. Without scrubs with
whom to practice excellence is prac-
tically impossible. In basketball
\\’li(:t'c the squad is much smaller this
is not so necessary. A longer conrt
schedule and the beginning of basket-
ball practice a month before the usual
date will be possible if football is
abandoned.

Dormitory life in \Vhittier Ilall.

home of fire hundred girl students of
Columbia University is interestingly
described by Miss \=\liiiifrcil Culbert-
son, an alumna of Geneseo State Nor-
mal School in the school's newspaper,

I'ler article says:

“Getting acquainted with 500 girls
who live in one dormitory is facilitated
by the seating arrangements in each
of the ten dining rooms in Whittier
V a

One gets acquainted with the meni-
bcrs of one's own class by being seated
first of all with seven others at table
After a brief period of acquaintance-
sliip, congenial groups organize “home
tables" of eight. Each two weeks.
however, a change is affected by lot.
In this fashion each student spends
two weeks at the “home tableH and
two weeks at other tables where she
makes new contacts.

\Vhittier Hall I: Intended for wo-
men students of the University under
24 years of .ge, althouin apparently
some older students and some doing
graduate work also gain admission
('niiiparatirely few restrictions are
placed on the soczal life of the stu-
'l‘liey are required to sign a
r VI. er when leaving and returning
to the dormitory and for week-end
absence must fill out a slip and inform
the assistant welfare director. They
may not be out in the evening later
than 9:30 without asking permission
or letting their destination be known.
Specal arrangements have to be made
for coming in late.

No deﬁnite rules respecting absence
from or tardiness iii arriving at classes
seem to be in force, as it is expected
that :0 students will voluntarin at-
tend on account of their interest in
the work which they are (10mg.

Students living in_Whittier Hall pay
$462 yearly for a single room. board.
and a certain amount of laundry. The
tuition amounts to about $250 a year.
In addition to these fixed expenses
there is a tax of one dollar a semester
for the support of student activ1ties.

These IIIthltIC an informal dance
everv Friday afternoon, open to all on
payment of a small fee. usually ten
cents, and various club activities.
Each major Stll)JCCl has its own chili
so that students are brought together
on the basis of their common inter-
ests. The clubs meet weekly for sup-
pers and dances. and sometimes pre-
sent programs in the Horace Mann

.dncation by liypnotisni is a far-off
po ibility and not to he thought of
seriously in the opinion of Dr. George
A. S. l‘aiiiter, professor of psychology
:iiid philosophy. Discussing the. re-
ported discovery of a method to hyp-
notize students into winning l'hi Beta
Kappa keys for excellence in scholar-
ship, I)r. l'ainter expressed doubt as
to the practicability of the process.

The discovery is attributed to a
graduate student in the psychology
department of I'Iarvard University, '
which Dr. I'ainter is an alumnus.

"I do not take much stock in the
strange stories of this kind which ap-
pear periodieally." I’rofi-ssor I’ainter
said. “Ilynotism is so subtle a plie-
noinena that we cannot say just what
is possible but the idea of inpiriiig
greater scholastic zeal by use of it

t

  

seems improbable."

to estimates of the Albany Chamber of

each year. (hie million dollars is a

cations. The college has been here
eighty years. The first year it spent
It s than 2850.000. The cost has been
t'iiltlg up ever since. Since I0l7 the

At approxljimatelyI It): on c;
evening oi iriday tie tliirte lti O
Marelit thirteen male lllL'l'Illicl‘bg‘ﬂ 
class of '28 wrested a green and white
banner from the masculine portion of
the sophomore class which was pres-
ent, three policemen, and two jaiiitorsl

After all other business of chapel
was over, on the “humloo” day, '28
llaunted its shining banner of yellow
and white in the faces of '27, and
ared them to "try and get it." The
men of '28 then followed up a trail
which they thought, might lead to
the highly-coveted sophomore banner,
but found, when on their way to Sche-
iiectady, that it was only a sorority
banner that they had found." They
returned it in due time. Later, with
a little persuasion not wholly lingual.
’28 devested '27 of its coats fora inat-
ter of a mere couple of hem"; at the
end of that time the garments were
returned, having been replaced in the
interim by overcoats and the like.
The next event of the day deserves
a new paragraph

"(iaiigwayl" '28 was “rushing” the
gym! Not more than lllll'lt'L‘ll sec-
onds had elapsed before thirteen of
the men of '28 had shot through a
window of the gym, down the stairs,
and onto the floor. Immediately,
policemcii's clubs began to land none
too soitly on the apparently undesired
freshmen, to which fact many of them
can bear witness. A lv'mnier flashed
threatenineg in mid-iii '27 tried to
stand its ground; jaiiitors endeavored
to throw out some of the freshmen;
but most of the defense was of little
avail. In this corner, one sturdy
freshman all but pulled a night slick
from the ls of one of the re. runs
from the bill]: precinct. Here, a group
of freshmen tried to raise ‘l ladder in
order to tear down the |)I‘t7,t:. There,
another one leaped from four to live
feet st i'.;lit into the air toward the
bailout and barely missed it. iii-
while, '28, '27, policemen, and J Ill-
tnrs formed the best melee that State
College has seen in _ with the
\\'t.‘lItCtl of the sophomore class, their
partners, and others as witnesses of
the fracas. Finally. three freshmen
pushed an iron and leather gym
"horse," with lightning speed, to a
position directly under the banner.

immediately the sopbs tried to push
' back from where it came, but—a
summer l‘I't ' against (iiibraltar!
Now one d' ng freshman took a fly-
;ing leap over the backs of the near-
'est sophs, paused during a split sec-
ond on the “horse,” leaped again
‘toward the bannen, and crashed t0
the floor with the quarry in his hand!
Then followed blackness in the en-
tire gym while another freshman
threw the switch that plunged the
place into darkness.

During the "lost" feeling which en-
sued, '28 dragged the prize to a win-
dow at the south side of the building
and. after making a few attempts to
pass one end of it tip to one of their
members at the top of the exercising
ars, succeeded. During the struggle
around the window, several more
blows were inflicted on the freshmen's
arms and beads by the clubs of the
policemen, who \vere supposed to in-
terfere “only to break up the band-
to-liand fighting."
