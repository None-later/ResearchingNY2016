Y. W. TO MEET TUESDAY

Miss Craddoclc’s talk upon the
Traveler‘s Aid last Tuesday was 0
particular interest to Y. W. in that
it stressed the social service aspect
of the work. Many services rendered,
although they seem small. mean a
{great deal to those who receive them,
she said. It is doubtful just what
Miss Ct‘addoclc calls a small service.
for most of her stories of assistance
involved what would generally be
termed hard work.

Next ’l‘uesday, Y. \’V. will hear the
Rev. Mr. 'larry Swan, director of
young peoples’ work. and of religious
education of the Fourth lE’resbyterian
Church. ~~~~ "—
