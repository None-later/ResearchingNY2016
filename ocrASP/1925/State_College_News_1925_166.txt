Six hundred State College. students

annual “mascot hunt" between the
sophomore and freshman cl: ' will

take plare. The prize will be a small
statue which will be hidden by ’27 and

hunted by '28

The event is a part of the year‘s
program of rivalry between the two
nuderel'tsses. Each has taken one

 

event so far. the sophomores winning
the song contest and the freshmen sue—
eeedini: iii stealing the second year
students' banner.

The statue will be shown in assembly
May 1 and will then be hidden somewhere
on the college rumpus er in one of the
buildings. No freshman class has ever
been able to locate it.

Myskania is in eliarue of the hunt. if
the t .hmen fail to ﬁnd the mascot the
sophomores will present it to next year’s
fresluuzut elass in the fall.
