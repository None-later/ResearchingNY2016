COURTESY DUE ALL

whether they're full profe ' ‘

tll"l3'\'Cl‘y which has been made. by
State College students. it explodes a
pet tradition which has been passed on
orally from generation to generation of
students. The story was tiat if an in
strtictor were late in int,I at c“
studc‘its would wait ten minutes he

late. they would tarry a quarter of an
hour while if the head of the depart-

for twenty minutes. All of which,

distinctions and students should linger
as long for one 1 ' for another.
