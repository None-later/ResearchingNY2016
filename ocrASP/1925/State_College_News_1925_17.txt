with wide changes to meet the grow-
ing importance of the college were his
contribution. In 1915 came the
reorganization of the faculty upon a
college ~ with the esttiblislnneut
or profes ‘ tips. a professor-
ships and a corps of instructors and
(nuts. In 1017, came the found-
ing of i\tvsl\'ania; in the same: tl‘ the
college News was first published.

sion was conducted with a registration
of 353 students. since rowii to 1.02.2.

War record. In April. I917, when the

iiiauy. there were 155 men students in
the coil Ily September of that
year. had voluntarily enlisted iii
hranchts of the government's armed
ft recs. 'I'he two male students who
did not enlist were both boys. under
the minimum age and unable to en-
roll. The record is believed unsur—
srd :iiid probably unique amoni,r
eastern colleges.

ii’usident‘s plans and efforts for ma-
llt'l‘iitl t-iilaritenii-ut near realization.
Purchase ol' the two and oiic—iiuarter

been etI'erted and In. llrubacher
secured two years ago a grant of
’$75.tl00 from the legislature tor the

ltion. I925 will see work on these
begun and may also the grant by
Illt‘ state of . 50.000 to begin COII-
