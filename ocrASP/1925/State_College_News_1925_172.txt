Reading By Miss
F utterer A Success

or

Miss Agnes l5). lintterer created l‘he
Great Divide” Saturday evening for a
fortunate audience at Chancellor‘s Hall.
The accomplished reader from whom
btate College and Albany drama—lm‘ers
have learned to expect much did not dis-
appont iii this play of conflicting ideals
written by William Vaughn Moody. The
grip of the drama which has afforded
players like Margaret Anglin and Henry
Miller a vehicle of worth was seized and
held by Miss Futtcrer in a manner which
was a revelation of her power, even to
those .vho recall her "Lady Windermere's
I’an.”

The splendid interpretation of the play
and its cast was an achievement requir-
ing most unusual talent, versatility, and
great depths of comprehension of human
characters. Without setting or proper-
ties, Miss It‘uttercr brought to the listen-
ers a vivid portrayal of the drama so
t'eali. ically, that until each act was ovci'.
they did not realize that the entire atmos-
[there had been created by the reader,

The variety of gesture was perhaps
most commendable, for this is where so
many readers fail. In the transition from
character to character, whether in rapid
ol' halting repartce, Miss lﬁ'ntterer was
successful in keeping the emotional eon-
tcnt and expression of each in the mind’s
eye while she was portraying another.

The story deals with a New lingland
girl who is forced into marriage with a
crude young man of the Arizona desert.
by circumstances beyond her control,
Their incompatibility is caused by the
appalling difference of their early train-
int,r and environment, Ruth, the heroine.
leaves her husband, Steve. and returns
with her son to her family in the east.
Steve, meanwhile, saves the fortune of
his wife's family. They summon him
and ﬁnally the young,r couple are brought
together. Steve, in expressing his views
of life, states a philosophy so fine and
clear that Ruth. for the first time, sees
the beauty in the mind of this man from
the \'Vest, while Stcre realizes it was the
standards of her people, of which he was
so ignorant, that caused their great
divide.

The reading was under the ispiecs of
the Dramatic and Art Association and
was well attended.

placed blanks in the hands of all
students, on which they will rate the indi-
vidual members of the college’s faculty.
The students have been asked to submit
their opinions of the instructors on four
points as follows: fairness in grading,
ability to present subject matter clearly,
willingness to advise students on personal
matters, religions, and vocational mat-
ters, and the faculty member's value to
Antioch.
