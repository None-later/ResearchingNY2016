l. "\Ve are one hundred per cent loyal"
'Es. 1

is a new slogan recently adopted by State
order to prove
that loyalty, we are till, before May 15.
goiilg to sign cards bearing our pledges
to the dormitory drive. Although cam-
paign talks and class rivalry lulve helped
to arouse this patriotism, they are not
e‘itirely responsible for the action we are
Dlilllllli‘g to take. lttlcli one of us
linnsclt a part of lllS collepe. and . he
is going to plcdv'e not from a sense of
duty or obligation to his college. bill
because of his love for it.

 
 

 

ASSEMBLY ETIQUETTE

“A chain is as strong as its weakest
link," How strong ill loyalty and respect
to their Alma Mater are those who get
up and l( sembly at will? if every
,studcnt co lcred it to be his right to
go and do likewise. what Would be the
standing of that permanent force of
enthusiasm called colle'rc spirit? Are
loyalty and respect mere frothy terms
used only in occasional nights of elo-
quence? The attitude of many students
toward assembly is a shameful example,
particularly to the great body of under-
graduates who attend assembly and re-
main ill the auditorium nntil properly dis-
missed. ’l'he weight of general student
opinion, however, should reinforce the
weak links iil State's chain of loyalty.
- point yourself as a canimittee of one
an spread the gospel of correct assembly
