TO OUR. MOTHERS

Dear Mothers:

Today we are given the privilch of
showing you our college. We who are
freshmen have learned to love it during
the past year, and we who are seniors
love it fourfold; so therefore we feel
that we are exhibiting one of our most
important possessions to the person who
has always meant most in our lives. We
are proud of our mothers; we are almost
equally proud of our college. This
wcclccntl we welcome you, mothers. to
State, you whom we feel to he the most
distinguished visitors we could ever en-
tertain. We are anxious that you should
like our college, but we are doubly
anxious that you should know how glad
we are to have you here.

With sincere welcome.
State College Students.

"Greetings to you, dear Alumni, is
the message of the Class of 92 .

“With the coming of the spring time,
our thoughts are fast turning to that most
anticipated and memorable day, that day
to which we have looked. forward so
much for the last four years—Graduation
Day. Yet. in spite of all our anticipa—
lim‘s and hopes. there has come to us a
feeling of resrret and sorrow at leaving
our Alma Mater, who has bestowed upon
us two of the most priceless of gifts——
Knowled e and Friendships.

"The Class of 1925 extends to you a
most hearty invitation to Come and join
us in thefnmmcncement activities from
June 12 to 15. inclusive, and ‘hclp us to

Permission from Charles, Froli'nan,
New York theatrical manager, to pre-
sent plays of Sir James M. Barrie. the
English dramatist. has been accorded the
Dramatic and Art Association through
Miss Agnes Futtercr, director of dra«
matics. The authdr’s custom is to forbid

d the presentation of his plays by amateurs,

but Mr. Frohman, on his behalf, has
allowed an exception to be made in favor
of the college group which is well estab-
lished and has been uniformly success—
ful with other writers' work. The privi-
lcge will not be used this year as another
play has been favored as the class's au-
nnal production.

“lccbonnd,” to be staged by this year’s
class, has been completely cast. Mary
Vcddcr will play the role of the leading,r
woman, while Vivian Hart will take the
part of “Nettie, the village vampire.”

ON MOTHERS' DAY

it is with great pleasure and satisfac-
tion that we present State College to our
mothers today. it is no less a pleasure
for us to take mother here and there
aman our friends. and make her ac-
quainted with our faculty and those class-
mates of whom she has heard so much
in our letters. Mother is one of the
blessings which we are forced to forfeit
for a period of some ten months while
we "go to colle"e,” and so. on a day like
this. we have the privilege of celebrating
a reumon. .

This is the time of year when Albany
is at its best. After going through Col-
lege. mother might be interested in the
Capitol. the Education Building. Wash—
ington Park and certainly, in our room-
ing houses. and dining halls. Don't forget
to exhibit the site for the new Residence
Hall, and then be sure to come back
for the Spanish Carnival tonight! Re-
member, mother is our guest and we want
to give her the time of her life. She has
looked forward to seeing our college and
is just as excited and anxious to see every
bit of it as we were the ﬁrst day we
came.

“‘The purpose of Mothers’ Day is to
"IVE expression in a special way to our
love for our mothers; to deepen recog-
nition of her self-foreetful love; and to
