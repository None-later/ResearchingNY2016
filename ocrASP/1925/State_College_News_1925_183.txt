83—AND STILL LOYAL

Dean Pierce reports that a letter
was recently received by the Residence
Hall Committee t'rom an alumna
eighty-three years of age. who gradu-
ated nearly sixty years ago. She'
states that her only income is a pen-
sion of thirty dollars a month. but
from that she is giving a little and
hopes to give more. A money order
was inclosed. If she can do that—-
what can the students do?
