as the crowning production of State’s

l’ulitzer HI and is a particularly
strong: example of the best modernt.
Anterich drama. However. it I‘epreg:
sents a departure from the usual pre—"
sentations of advanced drainatics
classes in the fact that it is not a so-
ciety drama. but a vivid [)(tt'lt of
a peculiar phase of American life—~the
New Englander at home. The play is
intensely human. It offers opportu-
nities for strong characterixations and
comedy hits, which are rollicking ‘
