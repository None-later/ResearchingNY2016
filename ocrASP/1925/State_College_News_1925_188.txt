Moving-Up Day, As
Seen By A Freshman

Moving—Up Day is a big day for scu-
iors. but it is nearly as ex iti for
freshmen. Last Friday. for the very ﬁrst
time in their lives. they “moved up," and
what an experience it was.

All this year, from last November till
May. they have been more or less dociler
obeying upperclassmeu. They have been
routed from the rottlnda and turned back
from the front steps. They have faith—
ftilly worn the badge of their infancy and
innocence; meanwhile. they have per“ -
cntly, patiently opposed the sophomores.

Now all that is over. Next year they
will be sophomores. Then it will he tiieir
turn to uphold State’s traditions. They
will do it to the best of their ability. for
last Friday they realized more fully than
ever before just what a wonderful privi-
lege it is to belong in S. C. ‘.; there—
fore. they have also learned how impor-
tant it is to accord her due respect in
every particular.
