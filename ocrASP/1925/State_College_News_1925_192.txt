The Past Year One Of Success In G. A. A.; Varsity

It has been said of lunnan-kind that
its greatest hope lies in its method of
relaxation, and to sone extent. at
least. it is true. To the college stu—
dent, college life is very strenuous
business and consequently demands a
strenuous form of relaxation if his
development is to be evenly balanced.
In State College that chance to relax
comes through (i. A. A. It means

I the chance for each to pick out the

sport that's the most fun for her, and
to play at that with little or as much
energy as she desir . It isn't fun for
just the few who can do things well;

who wishes to share in that fun.

lleetning it wise to let these new

their ideas on entertainment, G. A.
invited the frosh to preside at the

and so easily that. the juniors and
seniors were caused some anxiety.

Soon the spring trip to the lndian

are thought of. The over—night hike

All year long (i. A. A. has been
