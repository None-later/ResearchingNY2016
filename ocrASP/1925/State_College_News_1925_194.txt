ENGLISH

The English department has a tlirec<

 

lohl aim: to teach i ' students to know
and appreciate lite iture of all kinds
and types, to represent literature in
declaniation and dranmtivation, and to
create literature in public speech aiid
in writing.

Stress is laid not only on the litera-
ture itself, but also in relating the
lives of the various authors and the
customs of the people to the produc—
tions. Elective courses in the study of
Shakespeare's plays, language, and
stage conventions, in modern verse, and
biography, augment the development
of the taste of the student for worth-
while work. This year the department
is offering for the first time a course
presenting the masterpieces of English
literature to the general reader.

Students interested in original liter—
ary production are offered a course
in advanced composition as well as a
course in short story writing and criti-
cisnis. The Leah Lovenhciln prize in
English encourages work along this
line.

Oral English is a valticd part of the

interest in the course in this subject.

The cours in the department of

pendent and rigid thinking on the part
of the student. To this end considerable
work has been done in the development
,of wireless in connection with the

l‘liysics department. A Wireless station
is maintained where individual student
work may be done. The various hook~

BIOLOGY

The work of the department includes
courses in evolution and physiograpliy.
Th last courses, embracing the sub-
icc of geology. uiincralo._ and incle-
rology, are deservedly popular with all
~:tudents. both inside and outside the dc-
partmcnt. This year two field courses
have been given, one by Dr. Douglas, in
the identification of trees and shrubs, and
one by Professor Clifford A. \‘Voodard
in practical biology. including a study of
plant and animal characteristics. A
Biology Club has been formed with the
object of taking field trips and creating
an interest in the plant and animal life
found around Albany.

The courses in this subject are in-
tended to give the student the fundamen-
tal principles of biological science and
methods of . ntiﬁc procedure. The cle-
mcutary courses stress the acquircment
of an open mind. a keen ohscrv.’ition, and
a related and general knowledve of liv-
ing thingI . so alike in their l)llV§l'ilf|L’lCiIi
