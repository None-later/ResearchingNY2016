TEAM LOSES 
ON N. v. TRIP

’28 Plays Waterford
Varsity vs. Jamaica

The Purple and Gold basketball
team returned from a disastrous New
York trip Sunday. Defeats by Seton
Hall, Pratt Institute. and Cooper
Union were met by the team which
was forced to make the trip without
the services of Johnson, former‘cap-
min and guard. who has been ill three
weeks in the Albany hospital.

The Pratt game was the best of the
three tilts, State losing by only two
points, 23 to Zl, and trailing. the op-
ponents closely throughout" the game.
At half time the score was 13 to ll in
the Brooklynteam's favor. It was
Pratt’s fourth straight victory, but its
closest win yet this scasorp. '

The Seton Hall gamchplayed the
day after college reopened. showed the
need of Johnson‘s services to round
out the team. The score was 32 to 25.
Saturday night the Purple and Gold
played Cooper Union. the game end-
ing in a 32 to 27 score in the opponents’
.avor. .
freshmen men’s basketball
team, victors in two of its three games
this season, will play Waterford High
School five Thursday night at Water-
ford in a return game. The freshmen
expect to take a large delegation of
yearling students along in the rooting
section and are discussing arrange-
ments for chartering a trolley car.

A whirlwind game is looked for in
the tip-river gym. The Waterford
outﬁt is thirsting for a chance to atone
for the 23 to lo defeat administered
here last month and the freshmen are
determined to make it another win.
A preliminary will probably be ar-
ranged to the game between two
Waterford teams.

The freshmen will probably use the
same men they played here. Captain
Nephew will be at the pivot position,
with Grifﬁn and Kuczynski‘as for-
wards and Goff and Dobris as guards.
Waterford's tine-up, it is expected. will
be similar to that used here. Coach
Lowther of that school, will not an—
nounce his players until just before the
game.

State College's basketball team will
play the ﬁrst of a series of seven home
games tomorrow evening in the col-
lege gym with Jamaica Teachers from
Long.r Island. The varsity. returner]
from its New York trip,‘will he in
top form for a home game and an-
other victory is looked forward to by
the fans. ' 4

State's probable line-up tomorrow
night will be this. Coach ’Bakcr an-
nounced yesterdav: Knczvnski and
Hornuxig, forwards: Gainor, Center;
Jnckctt and Nephew. guards. in re~
serve the coach will keep Gilchrist and
Grifﬁn. These men made the New
York trip. :

No name has hceu booked for next
week because of mid-year examina~
lions. Saturdav evening of lunior

 

Week, January '31, the team will-play
