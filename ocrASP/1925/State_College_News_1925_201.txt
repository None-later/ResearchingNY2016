A NEW YEAR

A new college year has begun and
with the opening of activities a new
"News" board has come into exist-
ence. Our ﬁrst effort is before you.
“to are well aware that it has its mis—
takes and imperfections but we ask
you to remember that we are but at
the beginnng of a year which holds
great possibilities.

The "News" has the largest staff
in its history aml with the co-opcra-
tion of the entire student body. we
see no reason why this year should
not be the biggest in its history. Our
aim is to produce a paper which shall
be of the greatest possible service to
the faculty, students, and the entire
college. We ask the earnest co-opera-
tion of all and promise in return a live
and interesting “News.”
