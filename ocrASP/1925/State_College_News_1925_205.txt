TIME TO ADVANCE

Today the News presents to the student
body the first semi-weekly publication
that State College has produced. \t’c
present it as a sample—an humble
sample of what may be accomplished in
a semi-weekly, with the. backing of the
student body, financially and morally.

Ten extra issues of the News—that
is semi-weekly publication (hiring ten
of the thirty regular weeks of publica-
tion—will entail much additional labor
for the staff. It will also mean a larger
cost to the student body.

But the aim should justify both the
effort and the expense. Some day State
should have a semi-weekly Seven years
ago there were those who freely pro-
phesied that the "State College News"
would not live out its ﬁrst month. With
ups and downs, it has survived to disprove
them.

The editors feel with President Bru-
bacher that the time has cotue for experi-
mentation with another innovation—a
semi~weekly.

  

There is always true cause for sorrow
when a teacher dies. When the teach-
r-r is one like Miss Cora Anne Steele
of the home economics faculty, that
sorrow may well become grief.
scholar who knew her subject, a teach—
er who had caught the difﬁcult art of
imparting her knowledge to others, a
friend to her students and to her col-
leagues, Miss Steele is one whom State
College will deeply miss.

Service in another field. but service
which was as valuable to State Col—
lege, was rendered by Judge James
F. Tracey. the prominent jurist and
statesman, whom death hrs removed
from ‘the board of trustees. Judge.
'l‘racey accomplished much in a life
of service. Perhaps nothing he did

brought a benefit more lasting than‘

his work to further the protect of new
buildings for State College.
