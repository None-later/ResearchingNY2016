COLLEGIATE DEMOCRA CY

Hand in hand with the acquisition
of an education should go the develop-
ment of a democratic attitude toward
all mankind. an attitude which in its
sincerity of feeliinr and wideucss of ap—
plication will tend to unite men in
closer bonds of friendship and of un-
derstanding. Yet our radical friends
declare the average college man or
woman today is defeating this very
policy by creating social stratas with
dividing lines strong enough to leave
outside the circle of the “elect” many
most deserving fellowmcn. Persons
who hold this attitude, of course, ﬁnd
themselves little in sympathy with
modern college ideals, and. because of
their narrow attitude, are doing untold
harm to us today by attributing to us
Weakness which is not ours.

college men and women, is the task of
demonstrating clearly and deﬁnitely
the falsity of this accusation that we
are undemocratic. First let us throw
out to them a challenge to prove their
statements, for as accuscrs their's is
the burden of proof; and secondly. let
us adopt more firmly than ever a
policy which shall leave no room for
criticism, a policy which shall make
clear even to the skeptics the indubila—
ble fact that today college men and
women are more democratic and
liberal~mindcd than ever before.
