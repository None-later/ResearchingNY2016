shows. ‘
“llurint: severe mouths ol the year
from ﬁfteen to twenty students visit out"
ollice daily.” Dr. Croasdale said, “coni-‘
plaiuiiig of minor ills such as colds. head» i
aches, and indigestion. l’or the most part
th complaints are ' e to the ‘
fr sh air and exercise—«being shut iii
during bad weather and not venturing

for malady and intimidation. tfoinpa
tively the greatest number of e. .» 5 comes l
from the two lower classes. Seeminer
the juniors and seniors are accliuiateil'
and have learned to care better for them» ‘
selves.

“The percentage of minor ills aiuoutt
men students reported to me is less lliaii
among women. This probably means
that the tneii tend to look after them-
selres better than the women in the
matter of health habits. Liriiie coudir
lions of men at college are liltely to be
better than those of Women since there
are fewer men to house. This no doubt
helps the men to maintain better health.

“'lhe coming of the girls' dorniiloi'yi
will alleviate many of the minor ills
caused by poor living conditions with
which the women have to contend, I am
SlITC.

"in order to safeguard further, tlte
health of the college student, we require
a certificate of health iipou entrance.
lhis insures its that no student having
an infectious disease is beiui,r admitted and

' as a vaccination certificate
. a state requirement. A liltll"
oath physical e auiiuation of all eiiter-‘
int; students is also required. This‘
shows where the weak paints are."

Dr. Croasdale also said that the health
department urees more students to avail
themselves of the inﬁruiary privilege:
ltach student is allotted $3.. and for’
irarlet fever and diphtheria rases $7. ‘
While this would not be sufficient to
cover a prolonged illness. it does see a
student through iuiuor illness such a~ a.
bad cold or toiisilit‘s.” she exclaimed.

“illness Ellllttllt: State ('olle - student» ‘
for the last six years has been welll
within the average of that reported by‘
other colleges. We hope to have even

Dr. [frotisdale‘s “Health and llappi l
uess” recipe is: Lots of [real] air. much '
rest, lots of CNCI'LI. plenty of good food.
