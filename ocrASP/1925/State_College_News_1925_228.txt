ENGLISH INSTRUCTOR-
C ONDUCTS NOVEL IDEA

Miss Katherine E. Wheeling, new in-
structor in the English department, be-
lieves in knowing her class. She has
ninety-seven pupils in English 20, the
class in methods. From each she has re-
quested a snapshot of himself, so that
identiﬁcation will be easier. Along with
the picture these questions, among others.
must be answered conﬁdentially by each
student: “What deﬁnitely do you ex-
pect to be doing in September, 1927?”
“What do you eventually hope to be-
come?” Name any special advantages
you may have had, such as musical
training, travel, earning money." “Name
any handicaps that may have prevented
you from accomplishing what you want
to." "Mention several ways in which
you enioy spending your leisure time."

English methods students this year
are to attend classes in English in near-
by high schools, including Albany and
Milne to observe how work is carried
on there.

NEPHE W HURTS FOOT
AT GRANGE’S STUNT

Red Grange. Illinois university's
famous football ace, totes ice to keep
in trim in summer. "Red" says he
likes the work—it gets him money, he
explains, keeps him husky and is
fraught with interest.

Clarence Nephew. Iiiin scoring for
ward on last year's college winning
basketball team, also totes ice—or
did. Nephew also liked the work. It
was good for the muscle and the
pocketbook, too, he explained.

But that's where Grange's
Nephew's paths separate. Red has
managed to summer without an injury.
"Neph" dropped a big hunk of frozen
water on his feet before he had been
working a month. Now he's on
crutches.

State College basketball fans who
have been depending on the sopho—
more to bring home part of the wins
in this winter's season have been
downcast. But today some encourage-
ment came. Nephew's crutches will
go into the fire and he'll go back on
the basketball courts the first day
practice starts.
