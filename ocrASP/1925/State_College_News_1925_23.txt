much of a ltll‘ttlt‘l‘ to cut down a
cherry tree. l'lowever, if Washington
did not wield the hatchet, l'i'olessiir
lv'isley used it to advantage in his talk,
The legendary hatchet lieured in every
phase of \\'ashiiii.v,’toii's life.

The hatchet was lirst used hy Wash-

ley. “was very human. lle swore ap-
propriately, lie llirted, he danced. lie

conclusion, Professor llislcy quoted a
paragraph l'rom C. H. Van 'l‘yne:
"As men looked hack Over the years
of strife, they saw clearly that the
chief reason why the American cause
was not lost hefore France came to
its aid was the personal leadership of
