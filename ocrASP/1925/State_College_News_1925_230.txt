0A MI’US COUNCIL

System Of New Education

In Dr. llrnlnlcllt'r's article of
October 2.1. published ill your

columns. he concludes with the fol—
lowing pregnant sentence: “What-
ever this illtcl'Vt-ning school nlay he
cllllcd . . it may yrt llt‘Ctllllt' the
custodian of American culture as dis-
tillct from technical education."
Disappointing though this thought
is, perhaps we should be glad to have
it so clearly formulated. l'robably
for every serious young person his
coming to college appeared (looking
toward it) as a trip to (lenlpus, where
he would sit just below the gods and
eat of heavenly fare. (Looking back
frnnl tllc start) he seems to have
strayed by chance into another Den
of Ellic'cucy cursed like thc rest of
the age. We seldom mect tllc cul-
ture alld wisdom we expected. \th-
dist-over with horror that our asso-
ciatrs are but Ballbitts hurrying altt-r

To be efﬁcient. any measure must
have the loyal support and hearty co-
operation of thosc wllo (‘tllllt' under
its control. Lacking these things. it
is, at its lit-st, only halfway echctivcr
it becomes nit-rely a ligure ill tllc
minds of the people, obeyed only he-
causc force is brought to hear. for it
is often forgotten that laws are for
the bcnrlit rather than tlu' restra’ntl
of the people. 'l'rausft-rrcd front thcl
field of law into everyday life. the
principle still holds.

Recently there has been created at
State an organization known as the
Campus Council whose duty is thci
the guarding of college traditions:
This council is depending largely ftll‘l
its effectiveness on the manner witlli
which it is vowed by the student body.
Its aim, that of guarding traditions.
should be the aim of every student.
