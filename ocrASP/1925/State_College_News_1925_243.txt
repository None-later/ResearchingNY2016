MANNERS, NOT MORALS,

DEAN PIERCE BELIEVES

Tlte evolution of Miss America in the
last forty years has been one of manner—

opinion of Miss Anna 15. Pierce, dean

Pierce. "()nly their mode of expression
has changed \vitlun four decades which
have vitally changed modes of living ol
all people,"

And Miss Pierce knows whereof she
Ipeaks. She has been a college girl her-
self, tlleu pt'cceptrcss lit a gtrts' prep
school and for forty years a faculty
member at State Lnllcgu. Since 1905
she has been dean of women. in intimate
personal relationship with thousands of
college girls.

fewer safeguards," Dealt l’ierce believes.
“She was a more conventional miss.

day, but measured by those of her own
day she often found censure front older
people. it is the age-old struggle he-
twecn youth and matttrity. Youth thinks
its elders ‘old logies' while older people
bewail the foibles of adolescence.

“in her relations with men, I think the
nineteenth century girl was more I serve
than her 1925 sister. If her personality
was less aggressive. it was because liv~
ing conditions made it so. Underneath
she was just as soeialhwnimled, she
wanted to marry amt to have a borne of
her own. She led a tuore restricted life
and her st ' has gradually rebelled
against those 'c nus until today she
has verged near the edge of license in
search for expression of her new—found
freedom. littt the pendultttn will swing

ack. as it always docs. I think. and we
will find that young womanhood has
been bettert l by the change.

"Mothers and daughters, it scents to
me, were better acquainted forty years
ago. though perhaps the gap in mutual
um andiug \ s great as now.
Miss 1880 was perfect physically.
She and her parents alike frowned upon

'literary societies" but which amounted
