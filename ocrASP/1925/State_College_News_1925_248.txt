Machinery works: Man. thinks

According to college tests, man develops one-eighth
horsepower for short periods and one—twentieth in
steady work. As a craftsman—~21 worker who uses
brains—he is well worth his daily wage. But as a
common laborer, matching brawn against motor-
ized power, he is an expensive luxury.

With a ﬁfty-horsepower motor, for instance, one
man can do the work of 400 common laborers. He
is paid far more for his brains than his brawn.

The great need of this and future generations is
for men who can plan and direct. There is ample
motorized machinery for all requirements of pro-
duction and construction. But motorized machinery,
no matter how ingenious, can never plan for

itself.

And that: is precisely where the college man comes
in. Highly trained brains are needed more and
more to think, plan, and direct tasks for the
never-ending application of brawn-saving elec-

tricity.
