PHI BIC'I‘A KAPPA

Members of the faculty holding Phi
Beta Kappa scholarship “ lave told
what the scholarship insignia mean to
“will. Students barc long desired to
have established here, a chapter of Phi
licta Kappa. Dr. Leonard Woods
Richardson, l’hi llcta Kappa, and head
of the department of 1.atin aml (’ireck,
says that in his opinion, l’hi lleta Kappa
stands for scholarship and culture aml
auvnuc dcsirint.r incinhcrship in such an
Y'lllltlt should have both of these
unalltxes. Other members of PM llcta
Kappa spoke on "\\'bat my 0 11 K key
means to me."

Dean William H, Mctzler said, ”\\'bcn
1 set,- the key on a person I tbiuk~"|'hcrc
is a person who stood in the upper ﬁfth
of his c' .' Nobody can be in the
nun-r tiftb without appli dim] and
ability." He said that tlpulic'tti‘ut is more
illtp'n‘tltut than ability. for a person of
mediocre ability who applies himself, will
ou‘rnn a person \ 'th much ability and
little or no application. _

A key. however. also has its handi-
tording to Dr. Gertrude 17..
of the Molopy department, who
\(‘d. "It is a pretty hard thing to
live up to,"

Miss I" Ibeth Van Denburuh‘s ox-
pcrience is: “You get a little thrill
when you are first elected to the society.l
but after you are out in the cold world.
'it doesn’t seem to make much impression
on people in genera ."

l'roicssor Winfred C. Decker aseserts.
“To me as a student, the key stood for
achievement, somethian 1 very much
wished to have, but havini.r once paint-(1,
it, like so many other things in life, it
setmcd to lose its charm."

Miss Mary 1i. t"obb,
marked, “The kcy " .thing to live
tip to. It is intcrc. my: to consider the
question ‘.'\In | advaneiiw beyond the
standard of scholarship that I atttaincd
when elected to the society, or am 1 fall-
ing behind? Am 1 capable of more or
icss than 1 was then?‘
others at conventions pives one a feeling
of beinig linked up with people of other
institutions, This is an idea of universal
scholastic fellowship.”
