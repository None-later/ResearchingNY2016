The delegates. young men and wo- '
men. filled MeCosh Hall and entered
on their work with the seriousness of
a much older group of people. They
displayed the rare ability to stop and
sit down when they were through
talking. Few of the speeches were
more than two or three minutes long.
Women took their fair share of the
-lehate and their appearance dissipated
the impression that intellectual young
women are not good looking. Some
were hetlcr titan that.

Felix Cohen, the fiery editor of the
