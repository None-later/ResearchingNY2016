‘Due to the reopening of college on a
Tuesday, there will be no edition on

The News urges all students to pay
their student tax immediately after
the Christmas vacation so that cutting
of budgets will be unnecessary. Any
cut in budgets seriously handicaps the
work planned by the various depart~
mcnts. The News wishes to be able
to carry out the plan already adopted
of putting out extra issues and hopes
the. entire student body will lend its
cooperation by prompt payment of
student tax.

 

 

 

STATE COLLEGE N E WS, DEOE .VI BE R 18, 1925

In accordance with the custom of
several years' standing. the freshman
girls in home economics made dresses
and suits in Mrs. Frear’s clothing
Class for particular children recom-
mended to them by the Associated

drc 'cs or suits that they wanted and
were measured by the college girls.

for the cullt'gc. Cohen was elected
by the student council to represent
‘hcm, but the faculty felt that his ac-
‘ivitics against compulsory military
’rainiug made him ineligible, and
l’cppcr. who had been selected by the
Dean. was ccrtilicd in his stead. This
iluation, however, has raised the
question of how delegates should be
chosen. whether by the faculty or the
utudcnts. and it is possible that before
the next conference is held it will he
‘lccitlcd that the delegates should be
vlccted by the students.

As they went on, the speeches be-
v'amc a little longer, and the questions
more involved and a meeting which
had sturtvd out perfectly organized.
deliberatingr with emphasis and with-
out repetition became confused and
rhetorical, 'l‘bey split hairs over the
phrasing of resolutions and the differ
cnces of opinion. It also became evi-
dent that many of the colleges which
had sent delegates had given them no
instructions as to whether the World
Court was to he merely a step toward
entrance into the League, and that
other colleges had instructed against
the League, but for the Court.

The round table discussions took
up the cnt're morning Saturday, and
were productive of some radical views.
In the meeting over which William
llard of Washington presided, one
delegate was so in favor of the World
Court that be proposed that the Mon-
rnc Doctrine be submitted to it.
