Her By Kersliaw In Trial For Slander Ami Libel

Verdict in the case. of Kershaw vs.
Millett, recently tried before Judge
David llttlchiilson. has been rendered
in favor of the defendant, Miss I'lelyn
R. Millett. ‘

Mr. Kcrshaw, prominent teacher of
mathematics iii the Millie High School
and well known member of Sigma Nit
Kappa fraternity, brought a suit
against Miss Millett for slander and
l' ,‘loiis statements. These statements
were said to have been uttered in the
rotunda of the State College for
’l‘eachers to a girl friend of the de-
feiidaiit.

Mr. llcrbert K. llornung‘ and Mr.
Rollin Stevenson. the attorneys for
the plaintiff, endeavored in their evi-
dence to prove liy witness -s that Miss
M‘llett actually made these statements.
’l'he plaintiff, himself, flatly denied that
he had in any way given the young
lady of the third part any reason to
l-cl'eic they were eiigatz‘ed, or that
seriously inclined towards her.

'l‘lie attirncys for the defense, Mr.
l’ercy ('. liriggs and Mr. M. Dewitt
Landon, look for their grounds of
defense. the fact, not that the state—
ments had not actually been uttered,
but that the statements made were
trite, and hence not slander or libel.
'l‘hey carr'i-d through this defense by
calling forth two witnesses who testi-
ilt‘tl that they had heard the young
‘ady say that she and George Kershaw
\vere engaged They brought forth

'ilaintiff, his strong attarhiiienl for

verdict. and had to have it.~—Not that
it was the money—that was a mere
tritle which would not even pay his
attorney’s but that he. had to
have it to s re his reputation and
protect his good name.

Mr. Briggs, in summing up for the.
defense, admitted that the statements
had been made by Miss Millett. lle
poiiiled otit how the defense had pre-
sented evidence to prove that Mr.
Kershaw and the young lady were en-
gagi-d; that the plaintiff was tickle.

girls within a week shortly after the
young lady admitted the engagement;
that he was a “ballroom shiek;" that
he was so stronng attracted by the
opposite sex that he could not remain
true to one girl. Mr. llriggs denied
