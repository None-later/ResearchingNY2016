PRITCHARD SPEAKS AT Y. W.

American education is failing to
develop leaders. the Rev. H. A. Prit-
chard, dean of the Cathedral of St.
John the Divine, New York, declared
’l‘uesday afternoon. addressing the
Y. W. C. A. at its weekly meeting.
Present practices are resulting in the
production from public and private
schools and colleges of a student
whose mind is tilled with a jumble of
loosely correlated information on
many subjects and thorough knowl-
edge of nothing. he said.

'l‘reatintr the British method of
teaching which inaugurates specializa—
tion in study at an early age. the
speaker appealed to the students to
use their inlluence to bring about a
new system "so that the mistake of
leveling al-l minds to the same stand-
ard type may not go on."

Srhool teachers should not be
afraid to frankly discuss the llible
with pupils who question them, Dr.
l‘ritehard declared, adrlint.r that it is
impossible to "lilttil modern Children,"
and that "teachers should not ask
them to believe stories probably not
literally true."
