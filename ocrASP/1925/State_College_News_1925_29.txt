Dr. Ferry's interesting lecture. de—i
iivered in Assembly last week, made
it apparent to those who were in
doubt that scholarship, and not
athletics or social events, should hold
the lirst place in college life. The ice-
ttirc, seasoned with jesls and personth
aiieeilot ', contained many piiiloso- t
pliical generalizations drawn by a man
whose actual lite-experiences had iiir«
nislierl data. Albany High School.
State College. and Milne High School
were all fortunate enough to hear Dr,
Ferry. and main attended hoth lec-
tures delivered in the auditorium.
