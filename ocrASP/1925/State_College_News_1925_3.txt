egc, .Just recently we celebrated our
.eighticth. anniversary and reviewed
the progress which our college has
lnade. Perhaps in the year to come
iwe shall see a progress even greater
than the progress which has been
inade in the past eighty years.

if this seems impossible, remember
Ithat in 1023 it was believed that in
:sitience the highest progress had been
inade, but in the year l92~l a greater
hdvauce in science was attained than
‘liad been made in the past ten years.
So. in the year [925 we can expect
great things from State ('ollege. l)or-
‘niitories, intercollegiate games, and
the honor system; these and many
:morc projects may he realizeduwho
can tell?

Myskania represents the honor and
high scholarship of State College—to
them we must look for leadership.
The various clubs represent the spirit
and friendliness of State College—to
them we must look for inspiration.
'Our team represents the courage of
our college—even in the face of de-
feat. \Vith all these to aid us who
will doubt the future?

But the future success does not rest
entirely in the hands of our leaders;
it lies mainly in the hands of the
pupils. Work and cooperation on the
part of the students counts in the end.
No college cvcr reached its goal, unless
its students entered into its desire and
ambition with all their hearts and
might.

All our hopes lie unfulﬁlled for I925.

—-let's make them come true!
