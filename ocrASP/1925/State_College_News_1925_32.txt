of tnueh interest to the rollem: and
Albany soeit-ty: and a large list of

i\\l'ltit as follows ot ' ,
"'l‘he reading of ttsear Wilde's play.
"'l,ady \\'in(leru|ere's lian,” by Mi s
Agnes liutterer last night at (‘ltan-
eellor's llall proved that, it a play has
the vitality, the snspensit'e interest and
the rhat'tn. it ran be independent of
a stage, scenery and an assortment of
htttnans to interpret it. One tran sup-

ited as Miss |-'ntterer.
l'he prohletn of the reader is to

place the varied rharat'ters itt one's

ereate a bit of illusion. and by the
limited resourees ot’ the platform
t‘lt'lt' a ennvint‘inn pietltt'e.

"Miss lfntteret' does all of this with
ease. it is a misnomer to say that
she ‘read' the Wilde play last night.
She aeted it so far as it is possible for

-on to act it. The youth and
and pathos of the )‘I‘lIIIH'
(arly tnderntere were in her voice
as she spoke her lines, the hard Lillt't'l"
fulncss of Mrs ’rlynne that deepened
ittto the passionate concern for her
eltild. atnl the ntasterinl tones of Lord
Windertnere. She sketched the in ‘
llmrd l.orton and the other prattlet

the cracked voice of a dowager dueh-
But, more than these. Miss lint-
er created a play on the bare stage
,of (‘hancullor's Hall, if some magi-
tcian's wand could have peopled that
tstage with actors, and have set the
iseune, Miss Fnttercr could have acted
lat-3' one, of the feminine roles with
idistiuguishetl credit. She won a well
:deserved trthnte ot applause at all its
[intervals and at the end.”
