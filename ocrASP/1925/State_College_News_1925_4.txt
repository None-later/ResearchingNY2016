Piercing the Great

The General Electric Com-
pany incluics many special-
ists-—~»cnginccrs who know
about tunnels; engineers
who know about street light-
ing; engineers who know
about the electriﬁcation of
factories. These men are
helping to build the better
and happier America in
which you will live.

If you are interested in
learning more about what
electricity is doing, write
for Reprint No. AR391 con-
taining a complete set of
these advertisements.

Divide

West of Denver is the Continental Divide; hemmed
in behind it is an undeveloped district twice as
large as Maryland. That fertile area the new
Moffat Tunnel will open up.

General Electric mine locomotives are carrying out
the rock, and GE motors are driving air compres-
sors and pumping water from underground rivers.

The conquests of electricity on land and sea, in
the air and underground, are making practical the
impossibilities of‘ yesterday. It remains only for
men of ability to ﬁnd new things to do tomorrow.
Thus does Opportunity of 1925 beckon college men
and women tOWard greaterthings as yet undreamed,
and to a better world to live in.
