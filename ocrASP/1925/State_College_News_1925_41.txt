liroin lltI‘ stiidcnts' point of view the
educational conference held last week
was both interesting and instructive.
it offered an excellent opportunity
for us, who are entirely without ex-
perience, to learn of the various sys-
tems employed and methods used by
state educators, who have gained their
information through actual experience.
The round table talks, employed by
most of the dcinirtnicuts, resulted in
informal discussion and sch-expression
on the part oi the visitors, Amusing
personal incidents added relish to the
ocrasion. lll one department a live-
wire English class from Albany High
School, under the supervision of its
instructor, gave a concrete example of
a socialized retitation A great “1’
of lllt.‘ visitors xpr
to come again we. from the student
angle, would add our dcstre that such
a conference he. made an annual event
at State College.

DIGES’TICI) 'lNlt‘OlHlxvl‘ltiN

Dr. Eliot, look to your 5 foot clas-

 

    

    

 

sics. They are facing spirited compe—
tition at State College! Students

whose extra room is too limited to
accommodate a 5 foot shelf. or whose
pocket hooks are too depleted by the
spring dances to purchase a small li-
brary. are hurling it convenient to
spend their ﬁfteen minutes a day at
some one of the bulletin boards which
'arious departments have in charge.
Is it worth their while? Look and
sec for yourself, If you want a dig st
of the week's news consult the l» is-
tory bulletin board: if you want a new
slant on who's who and what's what
go to the library and read the bulle-
tin there, and, last but not (,i , don't
miss the, sayings on the Y board or
the hints which the Home Economics
department throws out occasionally.
li‘rce instruction is a rare. thing but
digested information is rarer. Why
not snap tin llll' chance while it's licrc?

 

 

 

 

 

',l.‘,lll'l AIM OF STA

Why is this a state college? Why
should the state go to the expense of
maintaining this institution? We are
apt to think that State College is for
the sole purpose of benefiting its stu-
dents. 'l‘liis institution, to many of
its, is a place where we learn the
“trade” which will prepare us to go
out to earn a living' ' ‘ollege for our
intellectual advancement and personal
pleasure. To a certain extent this is
true. The. State of New York has,
however, other reasons for supporting

 

t

its schools. The state wishes to de-
vclop the very best that is in each in-
dividual, for it realizes that the :aliber
of the state is determined by the forcc
and power of those who go to make
up its impulation., New York, as do
many of her sister governments, real-
i' the need of educated, right-think-
ing subjects, and. to the end that it
might. urc there, it goes to the enor-
mous expense of maintaining schools
and colleges, such the State ('olA

importance of teachers who are cap<
able and willing to give of their best
efforts for the education of younger
generations who are now growing up,

ment of our cities and states. So we
see that college is not for us alone,
but through us, for the boys and girls
who will be iiicit and women.
We must not think that college owes
us everything and that we 're ltlltlt'l‘
no obligations, We must realize the
true purpose of S. (f. 'l'. and do our

REVISION FOR REGENTS

A proposal to create a varying or
"lloating" standard of marks in re-
ts' exainiiuitimis, whereby a certain
. age of every class is passed
was made to the school principals and
siiperintcndetlts who attended the
administration round table conference
he'e last Saturday.

Dr. lloi'ard ti. liiirdge, principal of
the Statc Normal School at liredoiiia.
who presented the plan. suggests that
a trial of it be made at the regents'
aniitiations next January.

The flexible system proposed is to
operate, so that when an examination
is dilliciilt, as many will pass as if it
were ‘, dillicult,

“’l‘lie lixed passing mark should he
done away with." Dr. liiirdgc said,
“because we all know it is humanly
impossible for any individual or group
of individuals to make examinations
which will be of uniform dit‘licnlty
year after year.

"in a foot race the prizes go to the
of lirst, second, and third
places. lf lllt' track be fast, lll(‘ entire
Iicld of contestants makes fast time;
if tiie track be slow. the entire tieldl
inakcs slow time, yet the prices ai‘e'
awarded in the same fashion aml the
same percentage of contestants will
prizes on both the fast and the slow
track."

    

 

 

winners

 

lirom this analogy Dr. liitrdge pro-
posed a new scoring of test papers,

graded according to 'alues placed
upon each iptcstiou. When the scor-
ings were complete, the next step

would be to pass the number of she
dents receiving the highest scores.
This would be determined in part by
a percentage of the numb ing the
test. and also by tin l tandard
for the ti t. The aiiilards

       

 

  

\Voiiiil differ for e t iniatioii,
according as it was rated di icnlt or
easy.

Dr. llurdge holds that the plan

would eliminate injustices and would,
not bring about a lower standard in
scholarship.
