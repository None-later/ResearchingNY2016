TO THE JUNIORS

Following tradition here at State.
it has been given to us as junior mem-
bers of the " News " to present to the
student body one issue of the college
paper. We have done our best to give
an issue which will come up to the
standards set by the ofﬁcial hoard.
How well we have succeeded remains
to be seen. in its rough state the
material is before us; to us belongs
the task of presenting it in a ﬁnished
form. And it is not without a cer-
tain pride that we have neared the
completion of our task. Pride in the
achievement of our end and pride in
being able to serve our Alma Mater.

To the junior class we have given
this issue, for this week marks the
most brilliant spot in the career of
the class of 'Zt’. The opportunity has
come when as juniors we as a class
can add our link in the chain which
binds proms and luncheons forever
with the traditions of State. Our
part in publishing this issue of the
"News" is but a small one among
the activities of the week. but it forms
part of the chain and we have tried
to form our link as strongly as the
rest.

To our freshmen sisters and bro-
thers we have attempted no advice.
but rather we have given them oppor-
tunity to strike for themselves that
they too. when two years have rolled
around. may work with pride and
success for State.

To our class. the class of ’26. we
wish success, success in the achievc~
ment of greater and better things that
in years to come those who enter
these halls may hear of and remember
the deeds of the class of the blue and
white, the class of '26.

 

THE FLUNK

The person who flunks is not necns-
sarlly stupid or lazy. nor is the one'
who obtains a high mark brilliant or
:i grind. '

The students in Dr. Croasdale’s
freshman classes can prove that to
you. Examinations. for which so
much mid-night electricity is wasted.
are not so much a test of your infor-
mation gained from books, the proofs
of mathermnt‘ical theorems. which have
to be memorized. historical facts of
seemingly little importance or a haml-
ful of scientific names. They are
most of all a training in'self-control.
‘ln the days of the Stone Age, Adam
kept his mind in running order by
planning ways to dodge some dino-
saur—to-day we have examinations.

We have learned much more from
college than lessons from books. We
have learned to adapt ourselves to a
new and different environment, to
make friends, and to learn to respect
ntliers‘ rights and property. If we
have our pet course, we have gained
more front that than front the one
we expect to flunk. If you get a D,
or a flunk, don't be discouraged—it
is just a lesson you have learned.

THE NEED AT S'I‘A'l‘l'}

State College must have additional
state money for more teachers, more
buildings and more courses, Dr. Brn-
bachcr sets forth in his annual report
to the board of trustees, a twenty-live
page document.

Stating that the growth of the stu-
dent body again this year has served
to accentuate problems, President
Brubacher says:

“Our college plant is inadequate for
the present student enrollment."

""he classes are too large for the
most effective instruction."

"The teaching staff is not large
enough."

” "be college library is disreputany
inadequate."

" The laboratories are too small."

“ The situation.” he declares, " is
such that our procedure is largely
determined by the necessities and re-
‘lriCLions imposed upon us. rather
than by the dictates of a progressive
educational policy. The status quo
has become deadening."

Dr. Brubacher's figures show the
enrollment has inc d from 598 to
l057 since 1920.. ’l is a jump of
seventy-live. per cent. 'l‘hc instructor‘s
load has increased fifty-six per cent
while the st:th has remained station-
er

   

y.
lti contrast. he shows that the state
pays four and one-half times as much
money to educate a veterinary student
as a student of education. four and
two—thirds as much for a student of
agriculture and three and one-fourth
times as much to a student of forestry.
He asks special attention to the
needs of the library. the departments
of practice teaching and of commer-
rial education. Fifteen new faculty
members, the rest of the approriation
for the three. proposed buildings and
other financial aid is also asked.

TRIBUTE TO MISS MARTINEZ

Tribute to the late Miss Fraieesca
Pagan Mar lnez until recently ameni-
ber of Spanish department (acuity.
is paid by Dr. Brubacher in his report
to the trustees. Miss Martinez died
this summer while teaching at Middle-
bury College, Vermont. The presi-
dent says:

“Miss Martinez was a teacher of un-
bounded enthusiasm. To her, ltcr
profession was a continual joy. She
gave herself dcvotcdly to her work.
Her inllucnce on her students was
magnetic. She was a thorough
icholar. an inspiring teacher. holding
herself to the highest standards of
work. Many warm friends mourn her
and the entire student body feels a
distinct loss."

BEFORE THE LEGISLATURE

Upon the action of the legislature
riu the next few weeks depends the
fate for this year of the Byrne bill
appropriating $250000 to finance work
on the three building addition to State
College. Need of the new buildings
is admitted by everyone. including
the legislators. Enactment of the bill
is another thing. Last year it was
lost because it'was delayed until the
closing session when it was crowded
out. it had been passed successfully
through the senate and assembly
Iinance committees.

"he legislature gave the college
$75,000 for the foundations two years
ago. That is proof that they intch
to give the rest.

lJr. lirubachcr and college and edu-
cational ollicials generally will push
the bill to the utmost. Students of
the college, cooling as they do from
every county except one, have an un-
cxcelled opportunity to exert influence
upon their home representatives in the
legislature to make the bill's passage
more easy. Students and alumni alike
should write their senator and assent-
blyinan askiiu,r his support. They
should get other people iii their home
town to do likewise.

Work may begin this Spring on the
three building addition to State Col-
in

 

 

go.
liids will be advertised within a fort-
night for the digging and construc-
tion of foundations for three new
buildings to be added to the group.
State Architect Jones has drawn
plans for a building group which
is estimated will cost between $800,000
and $900000. The state was commit-
ted to a policy of expansion for the
State College with the passage of
Senator Byrue's bill of last year with
the appropriation of $75000 to dig and
construct foundations for the proposed
new group.
included in the group of new build-
‘ngs for which the state architect has
drafted plans are a new Milne Iliin
school, conducted in conjunction with
the college. a new auditorium for the
use of both college and high school
students and a new library and a gym-
nasium. The proposed new buildings
would be connected with the present
college group by a covered passage.
’Jbe three new buildings will front
‘on lVestern avenue acording to the
it’ll‘Cllllc‘Ct‘S plans. The site for the
lbuildiugs. between the present college
group and the Albany High school.
already has been acquired by the state.
The architectural type will be
Georgian Colonial, in conformity with
the present group. 1
