tiieiit aim not so lunch at making- the
student a chemist as they do at awaken-
ing iii him a quick perception and recog-
nition of a chemical problem. "l‘his
recognition is quite as important to a
business titan or wmnan as its subsequent
solution by a traitted expert. From
these courses. otte learns to cease to he a

ing of both French and German for their
doctorate. the study of German is agatii

‘nopular. both itt bivli school and collcee.
