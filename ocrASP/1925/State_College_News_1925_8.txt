having played together since the last
game with Waterford, six weeks ago.

selacr High school, wall from Water-
ford High school, won from Schoharie

FROSH TO REPORT EARLY

Freshmen next fall will report at
college livc days before the other
classes, in a colilinttance of the plan
begun by Dr. llrubachcr this fall with
the class of 1028.

The president announced this in the
animal report he has submitted to the
trustees.

[to said: " It is always a difficult
matter to adjust freshmen to the
new situations in \\'lllt'li they find
themselves. ’l'hev come from home
for the ﬁrst time. probably, and
may find the city either forbidding
or alluring. I’lonsing conditions are
not such as to make the tritiiSition
easy. To be thrown into registration
week with two or three times
their own number of upper class
students, further complicates the
dillirulty. For this reason the fresh-
men were asked to report live days

 

before the rest of the college as-
sembled for registration last Sep-_
teincr.

"The extra days were devoted to .
more leisurely adjustment of room-[
in],r and boarding conditions than ,
could he accomplished under thci
crowding and hurry of former years.»
One day was given to inlelligcncel
tests and two were devoted to special]
instruction to freshmen by the ad-l
ministralive staff. instruction was:
given in the economic distribution ofl
time and effort in the attainment of‘
scholarship; college life and manners.l
social usages and wise habits of recrea-l
tion were planned," '3

Junior Meets Success

Rosaline Greenberg, the junior who
had a chance to go on the stage and
tiirued it down, will liniin this year's
work at State College.

The youthful leading woman of the
\VGY Players who was offered a
chance on Broadway as understndy to
l"lora Sheffield, Max Marcin's leading
woman in the melodrama, "Silence,"
will not accept any stage offers this
.pring, she declared this week.

" expect to go on working. here."
Miss (ireenbcrg said. "Selwyn and
company have promised to give me
some more offers, but for awhile at
least I shall stay with the WGY
l'layers."

The junior student's success in the
radio drama came as a result of her
work with State College dramatic
classes, it has been learned. Last
spring when the Schenectady company
' seeking an ingcuue, Miss Agnes
ll. Fiittcrcr, college dramatics instruc-
for, advused the members of the ad-
vanced class to try for the position.
More than fifteen went to Schenec-
lady and read for Edward H. Smith,
until recently leading man and direc-
tor of the pie-plate actors. Smith
liked Miss Grceiiberg's voice and en-
gaged her to play Ner'issa in “The
.\lcrcliant of Venice." Success in that
and in a role In “Snowball” won
advancement to the position of lead-
ing woman.

The Department of Home Eco-
nomics mourns the loss of the presi-
dent of the New York State Home
Economics Association. Miss Grace
.‘iCllCt‘lllCt‘llOl‘ll, Associate Director of
Health Education, of the American
Child Health Association, died on
Sunday. January Ilth, having been
ill since Thanksgiving time. In her
two years of ollice, Miss Schermer-
horn had done a strong piece of con.
structive work at a time when the
Association was organizing into seven
districts in accordance with the
scheme of the New York State
'l‘eaehers' Association.

Miss Scheriuerhorn's unusual edu-
cational vision untiring energy, and
unselfish zeal resulted in a career of
unusual interest to students irl Home
Economics. In less than twenty years
of professional experience, she grew
steadily in usefulness in her held of
work, having taught in the elementary
schools of Springﬁeld, Illinois, in a
normal school in North Dakota,
teacher training,r work in Home Eco-
nomics in State College, Ames. Iowa,
supervisor of Home Economics. Long
liL‘llL‘ll, California. aiid linally super-
visor of Home Economics in the public
schools of New York City. The last:
two years of her life were spent in
assisting to direct Health Education
in the American Child Health Asso-
cialion.

'l‘liose who knew Miss Schermeh
horn personally, admired her simpli-
city and impersonal attitude toward
her professional work. Her loss is' of
national importance.

DR. SLOESBF—IHECTURES

A large delegation from State Col-
lcu iltcnded a lecture on “Recent
nuts in Science." given by Doctor
.. Slosson, Friday evening. January
23, at Union College, Schenectady.
lloctor Slossou, who is editor of
‘S'i'icin‘c Service," is an effective
speaker. In the course of his address,
Doctor Slosson humorously remarked
that " Man is a parasite of parasites.
lle steals his perfume from the di-
seased whale, and his honey from the
unborn bee. Ilc rubs the musk (leer
of his last s ut (cent), and takes
from the sleeping silk worm its
blanket." Many of those present at
the lecture were surprised to learn
that in Sweden lIll per cent of the
farms employ electric power, and in
sotiIln-rn Sweden. as many as 90 per
cent enjoy the use of electricity.

Phosgene, which was used (hiring
the war as a poisonous gas, has now
been converted into a perfume by
combining it with castnr oil. To put
scutinwutally, Doctor Slosson said,
"that which was once used to still
the heart of an enemy, is now used
to stimulate the heart of a lover."

l)r ‘ossou showed samples of
wild wool and fur, also some
synthetic foodstuffs. The cost of
“I‘Dtlllt'lilin of the latter is so high
that, “Even a college professor can-
uot live so cheaply as a cornstalk."

  
 

 

 

A prize of six million dollars was'

offered to anyone who would invent
a substitute for leather, “but,” said
I Slossou. “'l'ry and get it."
