FRESHMEN! LISTEN!

The story is told of a young college
graduate who on receiving favorable rc-
turns from his final examinations, tele-
graphed his anxious awaiting parents
A . “l'm educated." And now an«
other freshman class ltas signed its en-
rollment cards and attended the facttlty
reception. Will its members, at
close of four years of college life, con-
sider themselves educated, or will they
realize that education is a life process?
We upper classmen trust that they will
realize tltat an education is never com-
plcted. regardless of numerous diplomas
and Phi Beta Kappa kevs. Nor will the
class of '28 limit its education to intel-
lectual knowledge, we know. They will
strive. in the process of securing an edu-
cation. to grow ph 'cally. spiritually.
morally attd intellect . ly. Education to
thcht will mean a fitting for life, regard-
less of what life oﬁers. Success, we
hope. will not be measured by them
a material way. but thev will cotmt as
a success that life which most beneﬁts'
the lives of those with whom it comes
in contact.

JUNIOR FRESHMEN PLAN
SUCCESSFUL

The junior sister attd brother plan
this year is believed by its sponsors to
have been even a greater success than in ,
previous years. because. contrary tot
usual custom, freshmen arrived at col-4
le'Je Six days before the opening of
classes and the juniors were able to he
0 greater service than hitherto.

Muriel \\’ettzel, junior president, was
chairman of tlte committee and Marion
Rhoades, Esther Jansen. Mary Hitchcock,
were other members. The imtior brother
squad was in charce of Herbert Camp-
bell and Carleton Moose.

DR. BRUBACHER ADDRESSES
STUDENT ASSEMBLY

A direct attack upon the proposal to
Weaken the powers of the Supreme Court
of the United States as "extremely
radical " and an appeal to " the intelli-
gence of the American people to over-
whclm the proposal once and for all "
were tnade by President llrubacher ad-
dressing a crowded first session of
weekly chapel last Friday.

in. lirubacher gave the entire chapel
period to patriotic observance of (Ion-
stitution week. liixalting the position of
the teacher as a guardian of the consti-
tution and therefore. of national security,
he argued that education is primarily a
late, rather than a national or nntnicipal
function. Upon education, he declared,
rests tltc responsibility for the "public
opitlitill of the next ﬁfty years," anrl lte
pointed out as illustrations of the weight
of education, the effect that warlike
teaching has had upon the German peo-
ple, and the prohibition amendment of the
constitution,

Dr, lirnhachcr defended the principle
of representative government, declaring
that “if ottr representatives do not truly
represent us, it is our own fault.”
