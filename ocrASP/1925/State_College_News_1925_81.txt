Just once.
If every father did the family washing
next Monday there would be an electric
.washing machine in every home before
next Saturday night.

For fathers are used to ﬁguring costs.
They’d Say: “The electricity for a week’s
washing costs less than a cake of soap.
Human time and strength are too prec-
ious for work which a machine can do so
cheaply and well.”
