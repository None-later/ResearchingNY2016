IN EGYPT

Dr. Painter, professor of philosophy
returned. to State College from an all-
aummer trip abroad to Egypt, Palestine
and Greece, during Which he visited
places of historical and classical interest.

"In Egypt. once tlte cradle of learn-

as never before," Dr. Painter told stu-
dents. ” There ninety-one per cent of
the men and ninety-seven per cent of the
women can neither rend nor write.

a condition cannot become [maible The

the trttth that the degree of education in
otte auntie spells the difference between
men and that education is the redeeming
thing in life. In Egypt many members
of Parliament are illiterate and most of
the people are as ignorant as cattle.”

Dr. l’ainter said he took great plemure
in v' ting. itt (it‘cece, the scenes of
tures and discourses of l'latn, Socrates
and others.

l’rnl‘essor ltislcy made use of the op-

antl made his debut to the freshmen. thus
making it unnecessary to apply any of
the History 2 lecture periods to that
purpose. _

A novel plan was carried out which
added to the Inn and excuenteut gener-
ally-«slips of paper and pencils were dis-
tributed by the juniors for competition
as to the maximum number or autn~
traulls that could be obtained. The rc—
sults were so very nearly identical that
the judges were quite unable to decide.

The singing of college songs and lilt‘
serving of ice ‘cam and c ’l. brought a
most enjoyable evening to a close.
