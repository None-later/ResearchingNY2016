ton Square in the City of New York.

l‘he club, when organized," he said.
will begin a vigorous campaign for

votes in State College.
Speakers of prominence will be provided
and literature necessary to instruct the
voter will be distributed. in addition,
each student will be apprised of the ab-
sentee voting law and all its ramiﬁcations
and will he assisted in properly casting
his ballot under this regulation.

Stale Ct‘illege's organization will be
one of the student clubs now being or-
ganized by the Republican National Com-
mittee in about five hundred colleges," he
went on. “ Two hundred and ﬁfty thou-
sand students are being enrolled at pres-
ent in these clubs. and approximately
l5tt,l)t)t) will vote for President Coolidge
State. College in entering
the ranks assumes its proper place in
the affairs of government and under-
takes what should be from every stand-
point a proper and progressive step.”

Mr. Crane pointed out that students
who are twenty-one in many cases neg-
lect their right of franchise and that it
is particularly appropriate that future
teachers take an active interest in politics.
All students, whether twentyonc or not,
will be eligible for membership.

Two hundred of the ﬁve hundred
schools already have had Republican
clubs functioning for some time. The
remaining three hundred are perfecting
organization for an active campaign.

or preliminary organization, an ce-
eeutive committee of seven students, in-
cluding three seniors, two juniors, and
two sophomores is bcim: chosen. The
executive committee will elect its chair-
man and will meet the ﬁrst Tuesdav of
each month. Other committees for pub-
licity, membership, ﬁnance, absentee vot-
inu, and speakers will be chosen later
when the club's membership is partly
enrolled.

Ofﬁcial faculty sanction to organize
the club has been secured. Mr. Crane
said. Edward Easton, chairman of the
Republican committee in Albany county,
has been assisting in preliminary work
and in communicating with, the National
Republican Committee at Washington.
