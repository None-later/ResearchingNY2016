GET INTO THINGS

"All the world's a stage, but most
people sit in the gallery and throw things
at the performers.” Take the advice of
upper classmeii, class of ’23. Don’t be
criticizel’s or mere spectators but be
energetic actors. Get into things at
State, and make the college realize you
are you, not as a class but as individuals.
It you are athletically inclined, watch
the (i. A. A. bulletin board and sign up
for events scheduled there. The News
and the Quarterly invite contributiOLS
from you who are interested in literary
pursuits. For you who have musical
talent. there is the college orchestra and
the chorus. Find your place and fill it
to the very best of your ability. In so
doing you Will become better acquainted
with other students and with your pro-
fessors; you will take greater interest in
your college, and you will become a per-
sonality here, rather than one of three
hundred and forty—seven freshmen!

FORMER EDITOR MISSES S. C. T.

A bit of news from the class of ’24
comes to us in a letter received by Miss
’l‘allmadgc from Dorothy Reniiit, former
Crlitnr-in—chicf of the News. She savs:

"To describe my present haunts and
customs midst the peaceful tribe of red-
skinstohawk is a great place. The
school is all that anyone could desire in
the form of- light, heat, good looks, and
students. My discipline will grow rusty
from want of use. in theiafternoons l
supervise the grades in drawing. I seem
tovhave struck a responsive chord'iu the
hearts of the very young, because when
they, are not presenting me with flowers
and fruit they are hanging on me three
deep, Really it seems that the town is
ideal. The only drawback is the'lack of
young folks—those with a “ twenty-one "
point.,of. view, 'The young. ones; are all
in. high school, and the - ..arc busy
