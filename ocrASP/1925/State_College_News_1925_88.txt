To Give Concert
The lirst concert of the season, under
the auspices of the State College Music
Association, will lalcc place on Friday
evening, December 12, in Chancellor's
, Hall, when students will have the privi-
t lege of hearing one of the ﬁnest pianists
lin tlie world—Ossip tial)rilowitsch.
l (iahrilowitsch is not only a great pianist
but an equally great orchestral conductor.
He is. at present the conductor of the
Detroit Orchestra, but still finds time to
give a few recitals every year. The
bringing of a pianist represents a new
departure on. the part of the Music Asso-
elation. It 13 thought, however, that as
so many students play the piano, :1 re3
eital on this instrument will appeal to
a large number in the college. Admis-
sion is free on presentation of s’adent
tax ticket. Tickets will he sold to the
pnhlie for $2.00, and $1.50, and reser-
vations ’er them may now be made on
application to Mr. CaiiLllyu.
