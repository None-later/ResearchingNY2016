Next week the eleven will play Man-
ltattan College at New York city. Nov—
ember 15 the schedule will end with the
Springfield Y. M. C. A. College, the
strongest outﬁt on the list.

According to those who have followed
the football outlook at the college closely,
the team this year has played better foot-
ball than any of its predecessors. The
Worcester game first demonstrated the
outfit’s possibilities. Worcester had
scheduled the game as the second on its
season, anticipating an easy victory.
State’s eleven, however, held its oppon-
cnts to a 7-0 score. Worcester was
obliged to keep its entire ﬁrst squad on
the ﬁeld throughout the game. Last year
Tech won 39 to O.

The game the following week with
,iColgute freshmen, resulting in a. 33-0
' score, has been described as an even het-
i tcr showing. Colgate freshmen have one
of the heaviest teams in the east and at
itimes this year have rivaled their own
i varsity. A one year athletic ruling effec-
itivc this fall at Hamilton has kept the
ifrcshmen from the varsity squad.

Saturday’s game with Rensselaer
freshmen was also a. step forward. The
P. I. yearlings are thought to be'
stronger this year than last, although
then State played to a 6-0 loss. be

P. I. freshman outﬁt was recruited
from a class of 410 men.
