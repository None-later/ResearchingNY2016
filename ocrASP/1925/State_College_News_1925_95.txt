Civic Problems

iPr’ofessor Hidlcy maintains that 'His-

tory has to do with the vital prOblcms of
the‘day, and that time for them should be
given in the class room. “Absentee vot~
ing,” “split ticket," and' "blocs" have
been words whoSe meanings have come
home to citizens in the events of the
last few months. ‘

“Uncle Joe” Cannon, former Speaker
of the.House of Representatives, verita-
ble war horse, declares that as long as
the government is run by party rttlc and
majority, the people are defeating the
kind of government they believe in, if
they vote “split ticket." The-late Presi-
dent Harding declared that it the form
of party rule is changed, America will
be facmg the same problem of other
countries; “bloc” rules, class legislation.

problem of other countries; “bloc” rules,
class legislation.

“It is all very well to be independent,
split your ticket, and vote for the best
man. Split. ii split you must, but split
national and slate, not state within state.
It you Vote for a Republican governor.
and a Democratic senator, they will never,

According to Senator \‘ViillSWOl'lll, ionri
hundred thousand people in New York'
State do not vote. ‘Some of the best
qualiﬁed men think. it is beneath their,
dignity to wait in line with the IIlCIiClitll,
mob in order to vote. Majority rule can—

parties culminating in a “bloc” system?
