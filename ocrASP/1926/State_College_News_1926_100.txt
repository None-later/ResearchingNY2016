MILLS PRESS PRINTS
NEWS IN HALF HOUR
WITH NEW EQUIPMENT

The latest-type of electrically operated,
selfwfceding, flat-bed press has been
bqu ht by the Mills Art Press, publish-
ers of the STATE COLLEGE News. to print
the larger paper this year. The press
has a maximum Speed of 2,500 copies
per hour, more ttan twice as many
c pies as could be produced by the
~'maller job press which has been used
for the last two years. Under high
pressure. the new equipment could print
the entire edition of the NEWS in about
thirty minutes. but ordinarily a longer
period will be required.

The press is a Lee Two-Revolu-
'ion nrt‘ss and is manufactured by the
t‘htilienee Machine company of Grand
Haven. Ai’ch. it is distributed by the
\mcrican Type Founders company of
‘lel'scy City. it will print a sheet. twenty-
five by thirty—eight inches. The old
press was unable to print so large a
sheet as that used in this year's NEWS.
The new machine covers a floor area of
about ﬁfty-four square feet. it is about
six feet wide and nine feet long.

The press arrived in Albany last week

ONCE LUXURY, PAPER
BECOMES NECESSITY

The many student readers of the News
may have little idea how many changes
the paper has undergone since its birth
ten years ago.

The ﬁrst change the casual reader
notes is that of size. Not only has the
NEWS been increased by a column in
width and four inches in length but also
its volume of reading matter is accentu-
ated by smaller type, large headlines,
and many illustrations. if the ﬁrst vol-
ume. of the vas were consulted, the
reader would see how different are the
stories of those days in technique and
content. Realizing what a venture the
ﬁrst Ncws was, there is nothing but
praise for its valuable work. In the
days of the ﬁrst issues the paper was a
luxury to the student body. Today it
is a student necessity.

'l'oday's vas. like the ﬁrst News,
covers every student activity and inter-
est. it brings in totu‘lt every phase of
(f‘ollegc life. lieforc the birth of the
News the (‘olleee was a school. Today
it is a family, whose ties are made
doubly strong by the News.

DR. BRUBACHER URGES
HUMOR MAGAZINE HERE

A humor magazine would be a valu—
able addition to student publications here,
in the opinion of President A. R. llrn—
bacher. llr. lirubachcr revealed this be-
lief when he addressed a joint meeting
dinner of the. Nliws and Quarterly
staffs last term.

“i am conﬁdent that there is no lack
of talent for such a pubhcattrm," he
said. “The College is large enough to
support a comic macazmc."

UNION CONCORDIENSIS
IS HALF CENTURY OLD

The Concordiensis, undergraduate
newspaper of Union college, Schenec—
tady, observed its ﬁftieth birthday aimi—
versary recently. The paper was found—
ed in 1876 and its first issue appeared in
November, 1877. At the beginning it
was a monthly magazine and its con-
tents were chiefly literary. Now it is a

 

 

semi-weekly.

 

News Club Celebrates Paper

a special birthday cake.

Dr. Harry “I. Hastings was toast-

LARGER OFFICES FOR
THREE PUBLICATIONS,
IS BRUBA CHER’S PLAN

Larger quarters for the Start; Cor.-
i.ic(;t-; News in the $850,000 addition to
be built to the t'ollege have been
promised by l’rcsidcnt A. it. llrubacher.
lJr. ilrubacher announced this last year

at. a dinner given by the News and
Quarterly staffs.
The present, quarters, beneath the

stairs of the administration building, are
admittedly inadequate, in Dr. llrubru'hcr's
belief. l’reseut lionsng conditions make
impossible a change noW, however.
“When the three new buildings are
Constructed there will be special ot'tice
quarters for the'Nl-zws,” l,)r. lirnbarlu-r
said. “The ofﬁces will probably be
built off the main corridor which is to
connect the three present buildings
with the new structures. The News
will be then, as it is now, in the geo-
g'aphical center of the College.
“The t‘o-op will have larger quarters
nearby, and the NEWS otlice will prob-

ably be at tilt: hub of the College's
activity.”
Similar arrangements will probably

be made for the Quarterly, l)r. liru-

baeher said. At present the Nutvs,
Quarterly and the I’edagogue, senior
year book, are all crowded into one

small, poorly lighted anti unventilated
room.

NEWS CAMPAIGNS FOR
ALUMNI SUBSCRIPTIONS

A campaign to sell alumni subscrip-
tions to the STATE COLLEGE vas is to
he carried on by the circulation depart’
ment this year. Alumni subscriptions
will be solicited by mail. “Utnlergradu—
ates can aid in this Work by putting,r into
ahunui hands their copies of the paper
and by ‘talking it up,’ “ Thelma Temple.
'27, subscripth manager, said today.

luu‘iroved distribution methods for
faculty copies of the News are also bc~
mg arranger]. Faculty members have
been asked to give the address at which
they would prefer to receive their copies.
When dcstrcd, faculty copies Will be
mailed. ‘

'lhe exchange list, winch was revised
ast year, is to be again changed, to m-
clude several more of the leading col-
to be enlarged, in an ctlorl to put the

NEWS TEN YEARS OLD TODAY; ‘ ,
DOUBLES READERS IN DECADE '

 

Sixty Per Cent increase in Size
Voted By Students
Last June

CLASS or 1913_fOUND£ns

Was Financed By Subscription
Until Placed in Budget

 

in 1917
Ten years ago today the News was
born. The product of the class of 1918,

then just cntcring upon its junior year,‘
the paper was, for an OliCllll‘le issue, a
remarkably good production. It was
free from technical errors, and although
in lllakc-up and style of writing it was
not so journalistic as the News of re-
cent years, it was a Well-edited sheet.

The spring preceding, when the class
of l‘)l8 had given its class stunt in the
amiitorium, it bad departed from the
usual procedure of presenting something
amusin”. it gave instead an allegorical
play. showing the need existing for a
newspaper at State College. The idea
receier some attention and approval.
Later in the year, the sophomore class
received permission from President A.
it. iirubachcr to publish a newspaper the
following fall.

On October 4, l9l6. the first issue ap«
pearcd. It was generous in size. having
six pages, but the reading matter was
set in larger type and heavily "leaded."

In the beginning, the vas was ﬁn-
auccd by subscription 'and the ﬁrst year
was a troubled one for those who had
its ﬁnances in charge. Once or twice-
publicatimi had to be omitted for a week
hecausc‘ of lack of funds. lint in the
spring of 1917, the student budget plan
was adopted. The Ncws was placed till-
tier the blanket tax. a"d its most press-
ing ﬁnancial worries were over.

About 600 persons were in College in
i016 and the paper's circulation was
small compared With that of today. It
rrew from year to year, however. Last
year it moved from 1.000 to 1.100. This
year it has gained another 100 copies
and is at its maximum circulation to
date.

The page size of the ﬁrst issue was
the same as that which prevailed through
the Nl-zws' ﬁrst nine years. Last spring.
however, the student association voted
unanimously to supply the small increase
in the paper's budget which has made
possible a sixty per cent increase in size
thromh the addition of one column in
width and four inches in length. Al—
though the enlargement of the paper will
cost considerably more than the extra
funds voted by the association, the deﬁcit
will be made up, it is expected, y in-
creased advertising receipts. This same
source of revenues is depended upon
this year to nnv far any extra iSsucs,
such as this birthday number, and for
extra pages in any regular issues, such
as \ve"e furnished with Friday’s paper.
All this has increased the burden of the
business department to a point far In
excess of any home by the department’s
predecessors. The business staff has
been recruited this fall. however, and
advertising rates have been raised again
to parallel the increase in circulation.

NEWS ESCAPED LOSING
NAME TEN YEARS AGO

The STATE COLLEGE News at one stage
in its earliest days narrowly escaped
losing its name. Had the plan of its
staff in 1916 been carried out, today the
(‘ollegc mieht have not the NEWS, but
the State Collch Banner, or Titties, or
any one of a score of other titles.

“Readers of the NEWS are asked to
help ﬁnd a name, possibly more suitable,
for the College weekly,” said an au-
ziounccment in the ﬁrst issue ten years
ago today. “The publishing committee
and perhaps some of the faculty will
take ﬁnal action October 12. Sugges-
tions are welcome before that date."

Later in the year, however, the editors
decided that the existing name was best,
and it has bc"ome permanent. The uum~
ber of newspapers in the United States
with News as their name, exceeds those
with any other one name.
