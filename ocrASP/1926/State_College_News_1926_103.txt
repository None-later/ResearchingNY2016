'—

mm BIRTHDAY” IS

WISH OF TWO DEANS

My nnAn COLLEGE News:

It is it trite and much used wish that
I send you and still I knew no better
one so I wish you a “happy birthday and
many returns of the same."

You are amply repaying the hard
work and self-sacrifice of those who
brought you into existence ten years ago.
I believe your intentions are one Initi-
tired per cent good and that your occa-
sional faults are only those natural to a
len-year-old.

i look forward to your weekly visits
as eagerly as I used to anticipate those
of an old-time friend who came loaded
with all the neighborhood gossip.‘ We
used to say she was as good as a village
weekly. I could now say a “college
weekly. lel‘ore T know it myself, you
sometimes tell me what: i am thinking
or doing, Your suggestions are always
welcome and I try as a rule to live tip
to your expectations.

We have all come to know ourselves
and our associates in the College better
through your columns. May your in-
iluence grow as you try to build up st-u-
dent loyalty to the (,ollegc by Sincerely
and honestly telling the truth about the
aims and plans at it_an(| to establish
right student attitudes in their soctal re-
lationships and conduct. .

Most cordially your well-wishcr,

[\NNA ii. l‘nnu'n,
To Start: (Ol.l..i. 1 law. .

Greetings and congratulations on this
your tenth birthday. I trust you may al-
ways retain the vigor of youth and as you
grow older may it be a growth in wis—
rlom and influence which will bring credit
to the College and to those who have
bad a part in your ili'vi‘lopuitnil.
