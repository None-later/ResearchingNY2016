what participation in undergraduate ac-
tivities is accomplishing. President A.

five guests at the tenth birthday dinner
of the News Saturday night in the

is impossible." said |)r. liruhaclicr, “but
no college in America has yet tried it.
That is why college administrations en-
courage student group activities outside
the classroom, even if there is danger
that they will be given too much atten-
tion.

Sunday Telegram Says Tactic:
01' Architect's Office
Are "Dilatory"

CONGcSTlON IS R ES U LT
Editor Says College Additicins
Are Merely "Promlua
And Sketches"

“Dilatory tactics of the stale archi—
.cct's at?" are blamed for the tlelay in
:onstructioii of the College's three new
inildings by the Sunday 'liclcgram. The
.irticle follows:

"With an unusually large registration,
|c.pilc the higher standards, State
Teachers College is faced by another
year of crowding due lo the dilatory
.a ics of the state architect‘s staff. The
.iniiding which was to have been erected
is part of the huge building program
_iasscd last March, is definitely put off
[or another year.

"the only portion of the building al—
early erected is the foundation, which
was provaled in another appropriation.
The rest of the much-needed structure is
.ague, existing almost entirely in
promises and sketches in the ofﬁces of
Deputy State Architect Siniiot.

The earliest start that is promised for
the new building is set for December lst,
according to Mr. Siiinot. I'lxliortatioiis
on the part of the college faculty and
tidings for a quicker construction so
as to house the increased student body
were met with the statement that the
building program has already been
mapped out and was progressing accord-
ing to these plans.

“Dr. A. R. Brubacher, president of
the college, has been informed that the
first work that can be done on his struc~
ture is on December 151. This means
that actual construction cannot start llll~
til the following spring, making the
building unavailable for still another
year. Then, a change in the architect's
program may set it back even farther
than this.

"The crisis in housing the classes was

reached some time ago and the promise
of the state to ptit tip the new building
was seen as a boon by the faculty. Willi
the new building, Dr. Brubacher dc-
clarcd that he could accommodate 2,000
students or 800 more than are being ad-
mitted now. These 800 are now being
turned away because of the lack of class-
room space aiid acconiinodatious for
them.
“According to the records at the col-
lege; only about 300 new students can
be admitted each year to keep the total
registration within bounds. This is an
equalizer for the students graduated, and
those who drop out during the year.
The new building would widen the
limits by at least 300 right from the
start.

“Partially to keep down registration,

 

 

E.
I‘-

thc college raised its requirements.
More than 300 prospective students
were turned dowti this year for this

“The foundation for the new building
has been in place for nearly a year now
and has been exposed to the elements all
the time. It is pointed out that unlc55
work is begun on the building the
ravages of weather will be seen in the
completed portion. With the actual
start of operations set for the following
spring, the foundation will be subjected
to another winter’s test.

G. A. A. TENNIS CHAMP TO
BE GIVEN SILVER CUP

A silver loving clip will be awarded
to the winner of the girls‘ tennis tour—
nament now being played on the Wash-
iiigton Park courts under the auspices
of the girls’ athletic association. The
cup was won last year by Sarah Path-
crbridge, ’26.

Upper classnien receive one point for
each hour of tennis played, according
to the old point system of G. A. A.
Under the new system, freshmen will
receive 100 points for winning the
t ournameiit; ﬁfty points to the runner-
iip; twenty~ﬁvc points to the winner of
the semi~linal; ﬁve points to each entrant
to the tournament.
