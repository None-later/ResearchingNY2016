THE CIRCUS OR THE SIDE SHOW

l'resitlent lt‘ttlntt:ltet"s statetttcnt at th Nttws' tenth

birtltday dinner Saturday night praising tlte value of
extra-curricular activities is one which wil lind general
endorsement. llttt there should he an even gr‘atcr
agt‘ct-nunt witlt tln- Iptalitication he put up I" that praise.

“Sonn- activities are taking too total time," the

l't'l"ltlt.‘lll Htltl. "Some students ll.’|\t‘ conl Iscd the side-

show witlt the circus. Students who can tot keep their
work up, must not give time to gt'ttllp ac ivities."

'l'oo much time is being wasted in State (follege every
year in unintpnrtant club and other actir tics, I)cpat't~
mental clubs are worthy of existence otly when they
actually help stimulate the work of their departments.
Not one in three of the (‘lttbs reprcsctttitlgthe various
College departments does that. The dinners and enter—
taintnents. and abort-[all the stunts," to which they girt-
their energies. are usually harmless and occasionally
amusing. llttt the amount of rnuintitteelwnrk and re-
llt‘tll‘tttl and effort in general used in thItir preparation
is out oi all pr: ()tll‘llltll to their value.

The same can be said of the larger entertainments. one
or two of ivhiclraro given by thvse departmental clubs
and tlte others of wlticlt are spunrorrd by larger college
groups. ’t‘hcse are t'i't'tcullrter. usually" they till tlte
organization's purse. wltett money from tines has been
slow in coining. llnt tlte satttt' girls tllltlt't‘ in them
alizilhe saute costumes are worn. tuadt' ’ovt'r perhaps:
thr- piattist and violinist are thcrc'.‘ and the audience Is
the'sautc. All the entertainments are followed by Illt'
same sort of dancing with the stunt- ttlittttl‘ily of college
tlltllk‘t'gl‘tltltlillt‘Si taking- part. i t i "i

Meantime more wor_t|nvhile_ activities prc neglected.
The .Quarte suffers from a dearth of icontt'ibuti'ons.
'l'he linglish doparttnent must use the san r people over
and again‘in its,plays, tttttil the atulicuceouust be able
to prophesy pretty exactly how. each will act a role,
even before he or she steps on tlte stage!

lint the supply of that loud-devised form of non-1
entertainment. the "stunt," we have with 1us always, as
strrlng attd healthy as any other weed.l One out of
every live hr ."V is worth seeing. One out of about the
same number is well done. And one. ottt of about ten
is worth the time it takes to prepare.

The survey conducted a \‘t'Itl‘ or two ago itt which the
variety and number of acttiitit-s permitted,stndents here
were compared with those itt other colleges :howcd
pretty conclusively that State, (follege ~tudeuts are ttot
being subjected to a campaign of repression. lIt fact.

Whether criticism is “constructive” or
“mere fault-finding" appears to depend
upon whether it is given or removed.
Seniors are inclined to call it the former.
freshmen the latter.

my opinion. the only safe and courteous
way.
