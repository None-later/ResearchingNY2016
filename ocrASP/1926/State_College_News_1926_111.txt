congress of Plant Sciences at Cornell,

cluding Czechslovaltia and Ecuador.
'I'hose at the conference gave papers
on what had been done in their depart-
ments. Original research work was dis-
cussed.

“I received more beneﬁt from the con-
tact and interchange of talk with the
people themselves than from the papers
which were, for the most part, too high
ly scientific," said Dr. Douglas.

She said that site considered herself
fortunate to meet so many distinguished
scientists from all over the world,

“Sad to say," said Dr. I'Iounlas, “it
rained almost every day and poured the
hardest on the days trips were planned,
thns spoiling them."

ings sortie time this year, and President
A. It. IIrttbachcr has authorized the pur<
chase of this book for the College
i rary.
