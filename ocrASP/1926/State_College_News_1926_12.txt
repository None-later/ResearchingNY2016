A ﬁve-story building to cost $400,000 which will serve both as home for 400
college girls and social center for the entire college is the vision of Dean Anna E.

Pierce, for the Alumni Residence Hall,
already been pledged.

The tentative drawings show a main
hall with ﬁve wings, each to be ﬁve
stories hinh, so set that every room will
have direct sunlight sometime in the day.
There would be ample space to entertain
guests. The proposed large ball for enter-
tainments would
contain the library,
the stacks forming
wall alcoves in
which a student
can ﬁnd seclusion
and quiet. At the
farther end would
stage and
around the second
floor a gallery. At
a moment's notice
the library with its
easy chairs and
sofas on rubber .
castors may be transformed into an audi—
torium with rows of opera chairs. In
the S"tt”tl"f"of music rooms there can
be compartments to store all instruments

The alumni’s new committee on the
hall plan is functioning, and payments on
pledges are coming in rapidly. Statistics
for this year show that 588 college girls,
non-residents of Albany, are scattered
in 237 living places, an increase of
eleven places over last year.
