Mark’s"A Priort Speculation”
Lacks Empirical And
Scientific Base
Br DR. GEORGE S. [human
While rece‘ntly ltl the famous Ulti-
rcrsity City exploring the ruins of the
ancient Castle of Heidelberg I re—
called that Mark Twain ventured the
theory relative to the tireat 'l‘un or
immense liass in the cellar of the,
Castle that its use had been to furnish
water to the nowheer drinking,r popli-

lation of Heidelberg.

But Mr. Twain‘s theory has since
been called in question, in that careful
research and observation have made
it extremely doubtful whether there
ever were so many nondiem drinking
people itt all Europe as that celebrated
cask would supply. Also analysis
makes it very dubious if a drop of
water ever actually existed in that
selfsame liass.

Mr. Twain's theory, accordingly,
appears to be entirely an apriori specu—
lation, lacking all empirical and scien-
tilic foundations.

The adntnbratiou of Mr. 'l‘wain,
nevertheless, was fruitful in starting
reﬂections itt my mind concerning a
much weightier matter. As I sat in
a mountain park on the Juttenbuehl
overlooking the tuttraneingly beautiful
scene of Heidelberg and the Nerker
valley, I remembered that the, French
had sacked and destroyed this noble
Castle in the year “:93. This {art led
me further to ponder as to why l",u«
rope is in perennial strife. Jud for
the moment. indeed, it is rt-latitely
quiet and is being spungrd ol'l' an:
rubbed down by the lieagtie of i"t»
lions while it is getting its breath
for the next round. lint it will httllll
be in the ring again. My problem,
therefore, was why is Europe eternally
at war?

By way of solution l obst'rtetl, emu
trary to Mr. 'l'wztiu's :tttppmition, that
Europeans habitually ronsunte such
great quantities of lll'L'I‘ and other

 

stronger drinks that their minds are,
lint *

somewhat muddled all the time.
I discovered a still more basal cause
of this malady bellicosr, tunnely, that
all Europeans sleep under ieatherlnuls
winter and summer. even though the
temperature be a hundred
Fareuhrtt iii the. shade. (in win-re you
will you had the ubiquitous lt'illlll‘r‘
bed. The only exception to this is
in some hnlttls where 1\lllt‘l'lt‘.:lll.~l have
brought them into tonclt with real
civilization; here, in eases, tht-y hart:
compromised reluctantly and motlilied
their prevailing custom slightly, but
only by a reduction in the size (it the
feathcrbed.

Now I submit that any set of men
who can submissivvly endure the tor-
tures of featht-rheds iii the intense
heat of the summertime and lite, to
such purgatory, hell, and war have no
remaining terrors. Foam atnl feathers,
in In" keep the blood of Europeans
so i. it that they are ready to ligllt at
the drop of the hat.

A great poet wrote: "War is a
game which. were their subjects wise,
kings Would not play at." My theory,

    

therefore, is that the, goose malt s
leathers and feathers hare made. a
goose of all Europe for centuries,

quad L’s! demotirtrrmdam.

Contrary to the aprioristie method
of Mr. 'l‘wain I claim for my theory
experiential tact and, therefore, scien-
tiﬁc grounds.
