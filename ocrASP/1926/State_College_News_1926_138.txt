R00llllifl STANDARD

Albany's Faculties Are Not
We‘ll Planned, Says

Dean Plerce

DOHMITORY IS REMEDY

White All Homes Undergo An
Inspection, Some Lack
Proper Comforts

 

"We are unable to set standards itt all
rooming places occupied by College stu-
dents, due to the inadequate facilities in
Alliany,” Dean Anna iii. Pierre said yes-
terday. Ili‘eourrugetnent of the students
in hunting rooming houses was deserihed
by Miss Home. a ntctnher of the faculty
committee on student health.

While certain requirements must he
met in all ruruning places approved by
tlte faculty, it is not possible to set the
standards, which are really dcsirahle,
[Jean l’ita'ce pointed out, for this would
disqualify so litany places that there
would he a large nmnher of homeless
students.

"We have to lake conditions as r.
lind them,“ Dean l’icrce said. "Natur—

orally planned with a View to ideal
housing for students. \\'e can only ex~
pact to attain ideal Conditions when we
are able to lntild our own quarters.

“As it is now, we have to make mute

ditions created with Illl‘ll' needs lll new.
and with adequate tarnlty supervision.

“Under pre~ent conditions, we can-
not, for instance, insist on the unnununi
ventilation and space requirements lani
down for hotel rooms. We cannot Insist
on single hells, where two girls share a
room. Iloth these requirements would he

“We have a good many t:trl~. who

Rooms Too Far Away

“We do make some very definite rer
rtuiremcnta. One is that a parlor or
reception room must he provided where
women students tnay receive ralh-rs.
And we exact all agreement that proper
oversight will be exercised in matters
pertaining to students' welfare, such a~
regularity of meals, hours of quiet for
study, and hours of retirement.

“The students' distance front the fol-
lenc varies from a few minutes' walk to
twenty~live minutes or half an hour. In
most cases they are too far away to
make Il‘lLll‘ rooms available for study he—

Cr-mmntc distances that are too far for
their own welfare, rather than live in
morning houses.

“it always puzzles me, that while pen—
plc generally concern themselves artit —
y in matters pertaining to the welfare
of industrialists, it is difﬁcult to arouse
any interest in the conditions that stn<
dents have to meet, or any realization of
the importance of the question. It seems
to me that the social contarts and cm
vironmcnt of the young women n ho are
to be teachers of the future are of the
utmost importance, and that there should
he much more concern as to whether the
best possible conditions are provided for
them, and more of the spirit of eoopcrth
lion toward that end.”
