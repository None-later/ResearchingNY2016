The student body has this year paid
student tax less promptly than any other
student body since the tax system was
begun, the ﬁnance board has announced
The remainder of the tax will be obtained
before eﬁ‘orts cease, members declared.
Of the accepted budget of $11,813, only
$10,604 has been collected. This may
mean a proportionate decrease of six
per cent in all budget appropriations.
The freshmen have paid up best, ninety-
nine per cent; while the seniors and
sophomores are tied with ninety—four
members paid. The juniors are only
ninety per cent paid up.
