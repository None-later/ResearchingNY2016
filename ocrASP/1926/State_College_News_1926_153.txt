THE NEW ENTRANCE REQUIREMENTS
REMAIN ONE-SIDED

the principal student reaction to the change in cnlrancc
rcthirt'nIcIus announced last week for next ycat‘ hy the
(follcgc is that “now nobody but a bunch of grinds will be
able to pct it." Fortunately there is no evidence that the
iIIcrt-ast- oi the general rej't'tlls average which is to be
required will brim.r to the institution a group oi pcdants.
uycrly much interested in books and in nothing else. .'\uy
lair analysis of the prcsvut student body will show that
ability to get on the honor roll does not necessarily imply
lack of pcrs’nnality any more than it means that students
who are sullicicntly gifted intellectually to “make” this
list must stay out of student activities to do so.

The real problem in connccion with lhc entrance require-
ments is not that they demand too high a scholastic stand-
ing, but that the scholastic standing is the only demand
they do make. True .1 ccrtiltcittc of character is required.
but everyone is aware that this means nothing. Quite
properly a declaration of intention to touch is also required.
.1\ physical examination by the applicant's personal physi«
ciau with a ccrtllicatc oi ﬁtness is also rcquirctl, but this
in many Clt>us is an unreliable and sonlcwhat sketchy test
of physical litucss.

 

The ctIIphasis I'cmaius however entirely upon the scho«
lastic >ltlL‘. in fact, the t'ollcttc's letter to the state high
sch ols published last ucck says quite frankly that "those
candidates whose averages on tht: regents cxaminations in
thc rtntuircd hilt-cu units is eighty per cent or above will
he accepted as soon as the applications are received, if
they arc prupcrly rccoInnu-ndcd by their high school prin-
cipuls."

All this, of course, is quilo out of line with the progres-
sive steps which so many. colleges are taking in the selec-
tion of freshmen. licre no effort is made to see in advance
which candidates will benefit most by four years of edu-
cation at the studs cxpcusc. No account is taken of per-
sonality, the greatest asstct. barring only education, that a
lumber can have. No account is taken of the applicant's
high echool career, aside from its results as represented
in regents aver Psychological tests of intelligence
are given, but after, not before, the applicant is admitted.
It is no wonder that so many students cntcr, go through
four years of college life without oncc raising themselves
for a moment above the group level and graduate to go
nut into the mediocrity level of the teaching ﬁeld to bury
themselves until death or matrimony doth them part.

in selection of students for matriculation, State College
is ﬁve lult',’ years behind the times.

 

 

TOO FEW KUCZYNSKI'S

No State College student can read without a thrill of
pride the story of what Anthony KIIczynski, basketball
player, did Saturday uiuht. Men are rare who can show
the loyalty that was his Saturday night when he came front
the house in New York where his uncle lay dead to play
for his team and then returned to New York to care for
his two young cousins, orphaned by their father's dCatlI.

As anyone Wmlltl guess. a man who couhl do this must
have imprcsccd his pc souality upon his follows in other
a Kuczynski's team-mates were not surprised; they had
play i with him for twu years and knew him for what
he was, The other Collch men were not surprised; they
too, knew him for a man who could he depended upon to
pivc all llt' had to anything he took part in.

The Tony Kut‘xyuski's are not numerous in this world.

 

   

 

TRADITIONS VERSUS RULES

The distinction between Collette traditions and sopho-
more rulcs is one which cannot be repeated too frequently.
College traditions are just what their name signiﬁes. 015'
toms which have grown to be accepted by the student body
and have been incorporated into its code of action. Sophn~
more rules vary from year to year, as sophomore classes
vary.

College traditions will not be broken by loyal freshmen
nr loyal students of any cl'. The custom of wearing
“frosh buttons" and toqucs is a tradition. Tho front (loo.
custom is a tradition. State College students have learner.
to love and respect these and the other traditions. The)
will rightly resent their deﬁance or disregard by any group
The student body is behind the traditions.

("is HOPE FOR NEXT YEAR

State College can be cheered by the prospect that 1ch
year the College will have a good chance to cater lht
New York Titues' current events contest, in which about
twenty of the best known eastern institutions are partici
gating. It is too late to bucmne enrolled this year, [In
when next season's list is prepared, State College will
tudouhtcdly be given consideration.

‘thc greatest good," this book is convincing. .\s‘ an his-

who himself dcvntcd all his energies to “the greatest hood."
