INCREASED SUPPORT

FOR STA TI: COLLEGE

URGED BI' GOVERNOR

(iovernor Smith urged “continued and
inet ed support" for State t'ollege in
his recent message to the state legislature.
lle said:

“Our teacher training institutions llin’t:
continued to grow. The ten state normal
schools and the State College for
Teachers have bad one of the most suc-
'essful years in their entire history.
li‘nrtheruwrc, the year upon which we
have now entered shows a still further
marked increase in the registration in
these schools. At the beginning of the
,ll‘L‘nClll school year there were registered
wer 5,000 students in our state normal
schools and over l,lt)fl students in the
State College for Teachers. These in-
stitutions, occupying, as they do, a very
vital position in the training of those on
whom we must depend for the teaching
service in our school system, must have
our continued and increased support.

"We must also give necessary con-
sideration tn the physical condition of
the plants in which our teachers are
being trained. These should be main-
tained at the highest possible standard

 

 

   

of efficiency. This will be aided by the
bond issue amendment.‘

PURPLE AND GOLD READY

The girls' varsity will play its only
outside game of the season tomorrow at
three o‘clock when it will meet the Rus-
sell Sage eollege team on the Albany
court. This will make the fourth eon-
~eenlive year that the Trojan rivals have
been met by State on the basketball
court. Last year the Purple and Gultl
won by one point at Troy. Two years
ago, State won by a wide margin in
the ('ollege gym. And three years ago.

 

 

The first contest, Russell Sage carried off
honors.

State is favored to win tomor-

 

id that, except for one change,
Russell Sage's line-up is the same as
last year. Marjorie Janos, towering
center, will hold her accustomed position
for the third year. A different system
of play will be used this year with the
introduction of the sis-member teatn.

Rigorous practice has brought State's
playing to its zenith and a stern trial is
predicted for Russell Sage tomorrow

indispensable to success. a new leader is
being worked up this week to rouse the
bleachers tomorrow. Plans are being
