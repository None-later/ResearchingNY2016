tnt'y.

'lhe motion to present the portrait,
which will he valued at a large sum, was
passed by an nrerwhelmitu,r majority at
a rereut nieelint,r of the Junior class, fol-
lnwine' several weeks of discussion. A
class committee has called on Dean
Pierce and received her permission to
make the gift. President A. l\’t Bru-
llltt‘llttl‘, in an interview with Ruth H,
l'ftnn'e, president of the junior class,
praised the project as one of the most
worthwhile advanced here in ye 's.

A Junior committee, upon advice from

inemhers of the faculty, asked Mr.
Lithenir to undertake the portrait: lie-
eause at his inter st in the Alumni Resi-
dt- Ct' hall and his desire to aid iti
memorali/ing Miss l’ieree's services, he
ins agreed to do the work at some per-
sonal hiss. The Junior Class will carry
nu a campaign this year and next to ob-
t‘in one hundred per cent payment of
til: 5 dues to ﬁnance the project.
The portrait will probably be uaintetl
this spring, and Mr. Lithu‘nw will ex-
hihit in several galleries before it is re-
turned to the college where it will hang
until t‘nnstrui‘tinn of the Residence hall.
The original project was conccired some
time aeo by a group of juniors who
realized that the several years of con-
stant and nuseltish service Dean Pierce,
at the Cost of nearly all her leisure time
and at much personal expense, ,has been
devoted whnle~hearteilly to the work for
the dormitory liind. Recognizing the
unusual services contributed by scores of.
others toward the same project, the stu-
dcnts believed that it is Dean Picrcc‘s
work and hopes that have brought the
project through years of struggle toward
assured success. At the junior meetings
addresses were made by student, pointing
out how appropriate a class gift to the
collcec such a portrait would be and
praisingr Dean Pierce's efforts.

David Lithgow. who will do the por-
trait, is nationally known as one of
America's best artists. The best art
work available was sought by New York
state when the world-famed Education
buildingr was constructed and Mr. Lith-
gow‘s talent was obtained, with the re-
