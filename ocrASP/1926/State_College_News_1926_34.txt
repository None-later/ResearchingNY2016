GLASS MI‘il‘i’l‘INtiH
To the Editor of the News:

Dear Editor.—\Vitlioiit doubt last
Friday saw the largest attended class
meetings held at State tollepe for
some time. 'All classes report mori-
than the usual number of students and
the general opinion seems to be that
the students felt they really had tinn-
to give to the meeting. Usually class
meetings have been held ‘after assem—
bly aml have conflicted with the lunttlt
hour. All classes recognize that elf "
meetings well attended are more con-
ductive to class spirit than anything;
else. Why not adopt this plan of giv-
ing over an assembly period, _say at
least four times a year, to meetings at

- lasses. _
Rubi/Lit Ccnlldllt'l: our student assemblies
with the idea of raising the standards
of the college and increasing collch
spirit. Would it therefore not be well
worth while. four assembly periods n
year, to allow the classes to‘ meet in
s parate sections for the carrying on_ ot
business which the shorter nicetm'.y attei
or before assembly makes netirly mi-
possible?

“How Wet ls University? ”

Student projects are already under
way in many colleges of the country as
a result of the livaiiston Iiiterileiioniina-
tioiial Student conference which met dur-
int,r the ('ln‘istnias holidays. Reports of
these projects were bro it from every

 

section of the United States to the fll‘Sl
meeting of the continuation connnitlcc
which recently was held in Columbus,
Ohio.
Many of these student-directed midi-r-
takings related deﬁnitely to the demand
l

 

for church unity which was so per 5 ent-
at livanston. Thus at
t 1! university the young ipco—
ple's societies in the livanstoii churches
are movingr more closely litt;t'lllL‘l‘ in a
common use of the project method.

Recently a representative coiumillce
outlined an experimental program on the
question. “What is your :iiiii in life?"
Stndenls fi'oni vi ions denominations
undertook a wide siirvcy of studcut and
adult lc:nl--', from Al Jolson down lln‘
line. to dis iver. if pi 'blc, a izliiile to
