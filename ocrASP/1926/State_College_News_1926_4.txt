Work without Toil I

Ten or twelve hours a day toils the coolie. If he
carries all he can, he moves one ton one mile in
one day. For that he receives twenty cents.

More copies ill the Nnvi'nilit-r issue of
lllt‘ i'nllcw Quarterly are still uhlainahlc

G-E Motorized Power——
an ideal combination of
electric motor and con-
trol properly ﬁtted to the
individual task—is at
work the world-over,
relieving workers more
and more for better and
more proﬁtable pursuits.

Cheap labor! Yet compared with our American
worker, receiving at least twenty-ﬁve times as much
for an eight-hour day, the coolie is expensive labor.
In America we move one ton one mile for'less than
one cent. The coolie, working by hand, accomplishes
little; while the American, with electricity’s aid,
accomplishes much.

Plenty of electricity and cheap electricity —these
are two great advantages which America enjoys

J over the rest of the world. While our present gener-
ating capacityis 20,600,000 kilowatts, new develop-
ments call for 3,000,000 kilowatts more per year.
