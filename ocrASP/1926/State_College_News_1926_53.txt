“I’m Well (Hungry); Meals are Good (Rotten)”, Can
Write Students With Co-op’s Newest “Time-Saver

“Dear cousin. (sweetie), (sister),
(friend), (family), I need money (lov-
ing), (you), (clothes)."

So run the choices on the “time saver
for busy college students," evolved by the
Co-op so that undergraduates can send
home a full description of their activities,
classes, meals, etc., etc, witihout the
trouble of writing a letter.

A stamped postal card with the list of
choices on the back is furnished by the
Co-op at a nominal rate. With only

I the trouble of l'hecking the appropriate

sentiment, signing the card and address—
ing it, students, burdened, according to
the faculty by too much dancing and too
many movies. can let the "folks" know
everything essential.

On the market only a short time. the
:nrds have already enjoyed a {lure of

popularity that bids fair to continue. The
method of their use is simple. After the
beginning "i spend my spare time,“ he
may check any of these occupations he
chooses: "at church, in bed, at picture
shows, studying, thinking of you, shoot-
ing crap," “I am well, hungry, broke.
lonesome." The classes may be described
in one word, as “enjoyable, rotten, tire-
some, long." The meals are designated,
according to taste, as “ﬁerce, irregular.
nourishing, expensive, poor."

Thanks lur the clothes (money).
(letter), (food). I am very sorry (glad)
l am here, (you are not here) (l'm not
with yonl."

And varying degrees of sentiment may
be attached to the “complimentary close"
which ochrs “yours with love, always.
cordially, and yours only, respectlnly.”
