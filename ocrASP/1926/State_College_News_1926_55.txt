ON TAXATION

The College News has adopted the
policy of running from week to week a
list of the names of those who have not
paid their student tax. While the matter
of student tax collection belongs to the
Finance Board the News feels the mat—
ter of unpaid taxes should be bronuht to
the attention of the student body as a
whole. Fortunately the number of tilt-
paid taxes to date is rather small. and
yet this number is larger than it should
be. The tax here is very small in com-
parison with many other colic-ices and it
seems that this fact alone should result
in a bieh pt-reeiuaue of tax payment,

it is through the money raised by the
Student Tax that the various oruaniza—
tions of the college can carry on their
activities. We therefore urge every stn-
denl to give his lit-arty cooperation to
making-possible a Hill/i, payment of the
student tax.

Following are the names of students
who have neither paid their student tax
nor made any explanation of why the
tax has not been paid:

To the Editor:

Are we guilty of the accusations thing
at us by our faculty? Are we as yonne
as they make us? Do we ignore the
living problems (if the day? llo we
give most of our' time and thoughts to

One minute spent in the classes (lis—
cussing evolution, one minute spent in
the methods cla ' or one minute spent
in sociology cla.s or history chimes.
fivonld erase all of these queries with a
negative answer. We invite those who
riiiauthoritatively mark us with such
juvenile rating, to join otir discussions.
'.v'e challenge them to answer questions
;reated by that jnycnilc curiosity.

livohition'for instance, is the topic of
interest in almost every corner of our
‘corridors. is” it a law? Is it a theory?
Ask us; we shall answer one way or
another and justify our answer by Slllll—

Iefy your statement. We shall , "l

me more than anything relating to Tut-

and when i read the inscription

exodus. As i looked upon the faces of
these very lllt'll, whose portraits had
hung iii tlic pallery of my memory from

all the t-nrlnintinu glamour of religious
'ancy. there snrizcd withili me unnttcr»

The walls of the tomb of Tulank-
