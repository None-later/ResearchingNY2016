STUDENTS PLEASED
WITH TEE Ems

"Shoes That Damned”, "Tlck'us
Time". And Fancy Free
Charm Audience

FAY'S "WATTEAU" STA R S

State College is justly proud of the
success of the three plays given Friday
aml Satttrday, due first to the direction
of M' s Agnes It’ntterer, and tlten to the
ﬁne c . . and the chairmen of the rum-
mittees. Constance Ilanmann, Helen
Zimmerman. 'J‘heodore Hampel and
Sarah Ilarkley, under the supervision of
Miss Eunice A. l’erine, are to be com-
mended for the simple elegance of the
stage sets, and the tasteful arrangements.
Commendation of costuming is due Mil,
dred Graves. As a result of all this coop-
eration antl of the talents and suitability
of characters to their parts, the plays
afforded a great source of enjoyment to
the audiences.

"he poetic beauty, the emotional
power and charm of the “Shoes ’l‘hat
Danced," gripped with intensity, and
loosed imaginations to take flight with
the twinkling feet of Columbine. It was
the fittest play of both evenings, and
Julia hay, the brightest star. The
splendid portrayal of Wattcan by Miss
Fay—the gleam in his eyes, the dramatic
power of his emotion when he destroyed
the portrait, the poetry and loveliness of
his speeches, the agony of his soul whet
he drove the entrancing Columbine on
to dance, was superb. Who would no
give his heart away to be danced upon
by such an adorable Columbine, Melaoit
Grant. whose irrc. ‘tiblc charms held
Watteau's heart in a golden net. The
regality of Marcella Street as the Queen.
her poise and delicate interpretation of
the character showed fine dramatic
abilities.

The polish and ﬁnish of “Fancy Free"
was greatly due to the ease and grace
with which the characters deported them-
selves on the stage. The humor of the
situation between Alexander t‘oopcr tlllt
Niles Haight brought appreciable rc—
sponscs from the audieice, The wtn-

sophis tion of Delia.
in ‘ '(less Time” one had to put on

esting newness of the situation. and the
delightful turns of conversation. lay

ably by DeWitt Zch's facility of expres—
sion and subtle interpretation. The por-
trayals of the other characters by Ruth
McNutt. Edwin Van Klecck and Regina
Perreanlt, brought buoyancy amt fresh-
ness into the situation. The humor 0
the characters of the cook and Mrs.
Stubbs was well portrayed.

DR. BRUBACIIER TALKS
ON THRIFT FROM W. G. Y.

Teaching the value of thrift in its
mental. moral and material meanings is
one of the higher motives of modern
education. President A. R. llrubacher
said in a talk on “Conservation and
Thrift Day," broadcast recently by radio
from station WGY of the General Elec—
‘ric company of Schenectady. His ad—
lress was part of the program for na-
tional education week.

"America." he declared, "has wasted
’tlltI neglected its inheritance of natural

1 exercise thrift in that direction will
‘cave the next generation impoverished.

“The prodigal always is grossly self~
indulgent.” Dr. Brubacher said. “He
‘lemands and gets present case. He
wants abundance of the things Wili‘fi]
make for material comfort. He will
mt deny his present appetite for lux-
urics. He will eat now; he will be
uerry now. Why care for tomorrow?
let the children of the morrow serve
their own needs. If necessity be their
mother. they will become inventive.
But the prodigal will live soft and lazy
in the lap of present luxury. Why en-
dure hardship in the midst of plenty?

“The ideal or education." Dr. Brn-
bacher said. "is self control. The edu—
cated person is master of himself.
Bodily appetites are denied that future
