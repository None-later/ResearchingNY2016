FIVE COL MNEWS IS
PASSED BY ASSEMBLY

Without a dissenting vote, both
sessions of student assemth Friday
overwhelmingly adopted a resolution
endorsing the plan for an enlarmvl
State College News for next year and
agreed to support the bigger paper.

The plan presented to the associa—
tion for the News and Finance boards
by Edwin Van Kleeck, managing
editor of the News, called for a sixty
per cent enlargement in the size of
the paper, making it live columns
wide, instead of four as at present,
and about four inches longer. The
cost increase to the student body is
estimated at $400 or less than twenty
per cent more than that covered by
the present Neu" budget.

The large incr in College enroll-
ment, in College Ictivities and organi-
zations and the success which has at-
tended other College publications were
urged as reasons for the change.
ability of the present News to meet
the growing demands for representa—
tion in its columns because of lack of
space was also stressed.

"\Vhat the News would like to do
next year is to publish a four-page
paper, with about sixty per cent more
actual space than the present sheet.
This paper would have live columns
on a page and would be approximately
the size of thOSe published at Union,
at Colgate. at Amherst, at Yale,, at
Mount Holyokc, at Wellcsley, and at
most of the other well-known colleges.
This would help ease the demand for
space which is felt Inore greatly this
year than ever before. because we have
had the largest stall yet large
enough to keep in touch with all'
phases of college life.
