Electricity, which can release
woman from her burdens; has
airea‘ly created a revolution in
American industry. Wherever
mankind labors, General
Electric motors can be found
’k’ari—‘yin‘g loads, driving machin-
(ry’hnd‘saving time and labor.
And there is no branch ofelec- -'
tricul development today to
which General Electric has not
made important contributions.

 

A series of G-E advertisements
showing what electricity 'is
doing in many ﬁelds will be
sent on request. Ask for book-
let GEKJ.

In a ﬁeld in sunny Spain stands a stone mortar.
Crows hover around it, picking up bits of grain and

chaff—clawing.

Here Marcheta, in the ‘fresh beauty of her youth,
will come to pound maize. For years she will pound
maize. The stone will stand up under the blows;
not-a dent has the muscle of three generations of
women made upon it. But the crows will hurl their
black gibes upon a woman aging early and bent
with toil. _OId Marcheta—still in her. thirties.

The American, woman does not pound maize. But
she still beats carpet; she still pounds clothes; she
still pumps water. She exhausts her strength in

the time.

..;tasks which electricity can do better, and in half

The high ideals of a community mean little where
woman is still doomed to drudgery. But the mir-
acles .vwhich electricity already has performed
indicate but a fraction of the vast possibilities for
better living and the tremendous opportunities
which the future developments in electricity will
hold to: the college man and woman.
