"'l'he value of fraternities has been

 

a widely discusscd subject in past
ycars. Many arguments for and
agamst them have been offered.

Criticisms of fraternities sccm to be
based on two points, neither of which
is an adequate basis for the denuncia~
lion of all fraternities. Some criti isc
wlten they know nothing of the actual
conditions; others base their judgments
on a few cxtr s which provc
nothing—tth we always a few who
insist on breaking away and running
wild,

 

       

 

V st values to be found in
fraternity lifc scent to be in the per-
