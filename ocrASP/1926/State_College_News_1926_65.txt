Students learned that
newspapers with various interests, all
of which are catered In. The average
reader enjoys accounts of struggle for
suprcnnu , whether in sports. politics.
or rhhating. lieatui‘e stories are al«
ways popular even when they contain
little or actual news, llninan
curiosity accounts for the news value
of extraordinary events. Van Kleeck
illustrated this by Layiug that an ac—
count of the robbery of Sl0,000 would
not arouse as much excitement as if
the thief broke into an office and stole
$l0,000 and the otliec broom. In the
second cave, pt'uple's curiosity would
he aroused and the story would have
greater news value.

The opening para

nal 'ltt‘ writing, contr' 'y to most other
forms of literature, the climax must
come lirst and the other necess; .
facts follow in inverse order of im-
portance. In this connection, the
head line writer. who must select the
most sinking detail in a story, often
disai'rees with the reporter iii his Judg-
ment of what the climax is.

tive prominence of ditlerent parts of
a, newspaper and the consequent dis-
tribiitiou of the copy over the paper
according to its relative news value.
