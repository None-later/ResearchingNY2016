VA DUE OF EXA.

Whatever our attitude may be toward
exivninations, they are npoii us again. and
our only course is to accept them. In
spite of the adverse criticism that exami-
nations, receive, they still have a very
definite value; perhaps the greatest of
these is the “checking up" which they
cause us to do. With possible failure
staring us in the face, we take an inven~
tory of our past sins. \'\"e acknmvlcdge
some of them and try to put aside the
others or make excuses for them.

New Year's is not so far behind us,
but no amount of New Year's resolutions
can possibly make up for the things we
failed to do during the old year, nor can
resolutions cover up the mistakes we
have made since.

An avalanche of studious enthusiasm
for study during the few days before
examinations begin will not make up for
what we have lost by not working dur-
ing the year. [hit while cramming cau-
iiot be advocated as the best way of get-
ting the most out of college, it offers a
way for many people to stay in college.

It has often been said of freshmen,
“They will learn," lint many become
seniors and still do not learn.

What is needed, is a little State College
spirit applied to studying and a thorouin
conviction that, while social life and
athletic activity are a necessary part of
college life, they should be mixed with a
certain amount of good hard study.

 

 

Watch for the date of the "Post-
Exam. Jubilee!” It will be the
week-end of the last week of exams.

MAN Nor NECESSARY
IN HOME, GIRLS SA r

It doesn't take a man to make an ideal
home. It doesn't take a lot of money——
just ti ‘te, thought and careful buying:

This is the decision of the students of
the home economics department, who
have made an “(teal home" in the lower
(hit at 151 Western avenue, which is used
by the department as a practice house.
The decorations and equipment oi this
house were chosen and arranged by sin—
zleuts in the department. liarb month a
group of four students live in the house:

“Housework isn't drudgery at all,
you know the right way to (lU‘ll,” said
Kathryn Noonan, one of the tour Slur
dents who occupy the “ideal home" tor
October.

“We rook all our meals scrub the
ﬂoors, shine up the furniture, shovel coal
into the furnace, and carry out the ashes.
The work is divided differently each
week so every girl gets a clninco to try
her hand at every kind of work from
broiling the steak to cleaning out lllt‘
cellar.H

“The meals are the best l have cvel
eaten," said Miss May li‘illiughaui, of the
facility, matron of the house. “All (I
rooms are spit: and span too. The girls
take care of the furnace quite as well
(15 any man would.

“Our home here is furnished simply
and inexpensively: yet it is attractive
because the girls observed the principles
of rhythm, balance, harmony. llroivii
has been made the keynote color of the
house.

“Of course unalleviatcd brown would
make the house it dull place. So in the
cretonue, the pictures, the rugs and the
ﬂower: contrasting colors of rose :un
bliie have llt't'li introduced because they
lll‘lt‘lllc'l and harmonize at the 5. he time,

“Many housewives make mistakes in
the arrmigeinent of furniture because
they neglect principles of balance. They
will place all the heavy pieces of furni-
ture on one side or clutter up a small
room with superfluous chairs,

"One thing the girls learn here is that
one doaun't need to have niaho my or
antiques to furnish a house attractively.
Here we have llNCtl inexpensive ":
lhc. beds ave iron frames camouflaged
with a little point.

“There is such a thing as having a

 

 

 

 

 

house too neat to he a home, A real
home is a place that is lived in.
“The daily menus are carefully

planned according to principles that the
students have learned in their dietetics
coin‘. .

“We believe that the ideal home must
have labor saving devices. in the home
here there a washingr machine and a
vacuum cleaner."

SYDDUM HALL TO MOVE
TO LARGER QUARTERS

Sydduin hall is to change its location
about February 1, Dean Anna l3. lr'ierce
announced yesterday. The house had it
beginniiu,r through the desire of .l
Marian Syddum Van L' formerly
head of the Home Economic department,
to improve the housing conditions of the
girls of State College.

Syddum hall was located for three
years at 300 Madison avenue. [it
fall of l‘lZl, owing to Miss Van Lieii's
removal to Seattle. \\i'nsliinp;ton. [Jean
l‘ierce took over the project and rented
l linglewood Place. where s llIlVL'
lived for over four years.

/\ somewhat larger house, located at
.30 \\"il|ett slrcrt is under consideration
for the rcw how for f‘ydduni hnll. It
will permit the housing of a larger group
of girls.
