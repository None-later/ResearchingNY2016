TELLING ’l'lil‘) .\|.1'.\l‘~il

Announcement in this issue of the he—
tzinnitn,r by the News “1.1l'CillllllillHll by
the paper to obtain subscriptions lnr‘next
year from the class of 1026 is an inter-
esting cotiiiuentary on the development
of the News, now nearini,r the close of
its ninth year.

The present senior class, the. Nears
hopes, will he the cla.. to establish the
new custom of snhsti hing at graduation,
which will continue from year to year
with succeeding clas-«cs. ‘ A

The benefits to any college ol an iii-
forined and interested alumni are oh-
yinus. Such an alumni pronp cannot
easily he formed or m'iinlaincl Without
the existence of some close link between
undergraduate life and that ol the gradu-
ate. Such a link the News hopes in
future years to become.

Ten years will have passedvon ()cto-
her 4, next, since the day the first News
was ptihli. ed. Much copy has gone
over the News oliice desk in those years.
Hundreds of seniors have gone from
State to swell the ranks of teachers. 1n
the twilight year of its first decade the
News plans to bring itself liefore these
lnindreds of recent graduates. The pres-
ent senior class will he the first solicited.
Indications point to an encouragithr re-
spouse.

It is fortunate that the effort to ‘ob—
tain alumni subscribers comes at a tune
when the News can offer more than has
been possible iIi the past. '1‘hrongh the
vote of the entire student hotly a few
weeks ago, a larger, more complete
paper for next year becomes assured.
The Alumni Quarterly, under the cap~
able editing of Mrs. (Ilande llashforil.
is performing a laudable service in keep-
ing alumni informed and interested
among themselves. The News hopes to
supplement and add to that service by
keeping alumni informed and interested
from week to week in the college and
the undergraduate body.
