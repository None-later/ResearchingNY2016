“Sweet and Deliciously

A State College girl has America’s
best radio voice. Kosaliue Greetiberg,
'20, has won the perfect radio voice con-
test sponsored by the Radio World's
fair. Her voice was broadcasth from
the New Madison Square garden in New
York City.

It was only after great deliberatim
that the victor in the contest was deter-
mined. llut when a mass of evidence
was produced testifyiur to the specntl
quality of her voice, tie directors de-
cided in her favor. lepcrlS have writ-
ten of Miss (irecnherg in such manner
as this:

"Her golden tones awaken the waves
the ether as We may fancy Triton’s

 

liorii awakened the waves of the sea.”

Provocative”, Says Listeners

A number of radio fans spoke of Miss
Greenberg's voice as being “impressive,
appealing and expressive," one man
stating that it was “chockful of inflec-
tions, sweet and deliciously provocative
at times."

At New Madison Square garden she
was introduced to Dr. Frank E. Miller,
considered the foremost authority on the
voice, who has just returned front Eu—
rope.

While an umlergradtntte at College,
Miss Grecnbei'g was the leading lady of
the WGY players. Her voice has been
heard by many millions of people, many
in linropc, where the Schenectady sta-
tion is heard frequently..

Miss Greenberg is a member of Alpha
