In bungalow or mansion, workshop or factory,
dormitory or auditorium, there is no excuse for

poor illumination.

We have cheaper and better

lighting in the electric lamp than ever before; for
the dollar that bought 1,115 candlepower-hours of
light with the carbon-ﬁlament lamps of 1886,
now buys 16,200 candlepower-hours of light with
the MAZDA lamps.

Not only more light, but correctly applied light, is
the order of the day. The electric lamp, with its
ﬁameless yet highly concentrated light source,
lends itself ideally to reﬂectors, shades, and screens.
It is controlled light—safe light. And illumina-
tion becomes an exact science.

During college days and in after life, correct light-

 

v

ing must ever be of paramount importance to the
college man and woman. Good lighting is the
worthy handmaiden of culture and progress.
