STATE COLLEGE NEWS, OCTOBER 1, 1920

 

POETRY BOOK iiiiis
REVIEWER’S PRAISE

Knickerbocker Press Critic
Say. it in a Credit To
Its Contributors"

State College’s Book of Stttdent Verse
published last spring under the super-
vision of Professor R. H. Kirtland of
the English department is winning high
praise from reviewers.

Commenting on the publication iii its
weekly book page, the Knickerbocker
Press recently said:

“It is a credit to its contributors, to
its compiler and to the college. Not
a few of its writers demonstrate that
they have the true gift of poesy.” The
review continues:

"This little volume of 127 pages is
made up wholly of poems written by
students at the State College for Teach-
ers in Albany from 1909 to 1926. It is
a credit to its contributors, its compiler
and to the college. It compares favor-
ably with most so-called ‘undergraduate
verse.‘ Not a few of its writers demon-
strate that they have the true gift of
poesy. There is youthful thought some-
times but the dreams of youth are poetic
dreams.

“Among the contributors are: Eliza—
beth Beckwitli. Marion Iiessette. Alice
Clear. Dorothy DavidSon, Martha
lit-nicer, Kolizi I-Ia'z‘er. (llga .\. lIainpeI.
Margaret l. Kirtland, Margaret Knapp.
Elizabeth Makin, Ruth I... Moore. Eliza—
beth Osborne, Eunice Rice, Sophia Rog-
ers. Dorothy Wardell. ('ii'ace \\"'oodford.
liorothy \f. Iiennit. Ila Ilutton, Mary
lirahn. 'II. Ii, '17,' Jessie Luck. (.‘liristy
Nichols.

“It is hardly fair to mention only a
few poems in a book that is uniformly
good but Kolin ilagcr's ‘()ne I’rays to
find has some excellent lines and swing
that appeals.

“ "l‘be l-Ielderbergs.‘ by Margaret Kii't-
land is worth quoting.

“Ix'uth I.. Moore's song, based on the
tradition that when a sailor dies on shore
his soul goes out with the ebbing tide is
good.

“Many will find in this book of verse
sinnething for every mood. The reviewer
. was considerably surprised by the excel-
Ience of the collection.”

ORDER BOOKS BY NAME,
CO-OP MANAGER URGES

State College ('o-op has reopened bet-

also several new books on the rental
shelf.

"I will do all in my power to help
the students in college this year," said
.‘fiss Fay. “and if they want to recipro—
>. :e. l will appreciate their remembering
the ililiil'» of the books they want and
askin for tlicm by name rather than by
the class they are to be used for. I also
wish the students to call for the books
they order immediately upon their ar-
rival so that the shelves may be cleared
for new books as soon as possible, Our
service will be improied if they will
advise me within a day or two after
they order a book, if they wish to cancel
that order and so avoid any confusion
which may otherwise ensue.”

First Days Most Important,

The decisions and actions of a fresh-

man duringr the first few days of his
college life are among the most impor-
tant of his life, Miss Anna E. Pierce.
dean of women, declares in her official
welcome to the institution's largest en—
tering class, included in the 1927 hand-
book.
“College at last—the great adventure
to which yoti have looked forward to
so long,” Miss Pierce wrote. “Will it
be all that you have expected and hoped?
That depends so largely on your decisions
and your activities during your first days
that probably tltere have been few days
in your life so fraught with great cott-
scqucziccs as these will he.

“The all inmoriant thing therefore is
to line at your command all of. your
poivurs of body. mind and heart. This
you cannot do if you are afraid and
worried. If you will keep in mind that
this whole college contniiinitywadmini-
strative officers, faculty and students—is
more ea'cr than you know to help you
throurh these. first days, you will realize
that there is no occasion for fear. Prob-
ably i‘evet' in all your life have you been
surroiindtal by so many sincere friends
waitng to help you.

I’ers-nicil‘y I shall feel hurt and dis-
ap-pointel if I evcr hear that one of you
was troii‘iied durin'z' these first days and
did not cone to me a'ul let me try to
help you. What a loving mother ivould

Hard Work Best Success Recipe Says Dr. Mctchr

Dean Pierce Declares;

do, you will always find me ready to
do."

Hard work is the only recipe for col-
(cite. Dr. William H. Metzler, dean, told
the freshmen.

"Greetings and best wishes for your
future and happiness," he wrote. "To
insure these you must wurk harder than
you did in hiin school. You must plan
your work and live up to your plans.
‘xerin the first day and keep even, if not
ahead of it.

“Exercise in the open and keep your
body fit. Select your friends carefully
tiid wisely and attend your church and
lible class regularly."

The message of President A. R. llirii-
baclier is:

“It is a pleasure to meet you at the
.ateway and bid you Welcome. You
enter a fuller. freer, more abundant life
than yoti have ever known. Here is
freedom togrow to the stature of re.-
fined, cultivated, high-minded educated
manhood and Womanhood. You are
here free to make the most of the native
tapacitics that are yours; free to devote
ill your time and energy to the pursuit
if knowledge; free to devote yourself
to friends, old and new; free to discover
new enthinziasnis and to cultivate them:
free to think hiin thoughts: free to live
pure lives. To all of this freedom I
ltaiid you this key as you take your place
among the goodly company of State
("wilt-are men and women.”

Good taste and good health
demand sound teeth and
sweet breath.

The use of Wrigley’s chew-
ing gum after every meal takes
care of this important item of
personal hygiene in a delight-
ful, refreshing way-mbv clear-
ing the teeth of food particles
and by helping the digestion.

The result is a awaet breath that
shows care for one's self and con-
Iiderntion for others—both marks
of reﬁnement.
