"l'ltillsct‘lt'ttlilllg’ time nearly always
exposes surprises, even in a well or-

year has been no exception. in looking
over my letters and papers of last sum-
mer, when l was ill for a season and not
able to attend to them, I came across
my ‘Aluniiii Quarterly.‘ containing the
photograph of the almnni group that you
so kindly sent me. That was an agree-
able surprise, but my chagrin was great
because I had failed to express my

appreciation, as my early education iti
these matters oi socml etiquette was not
neglected.H

AND 'ROOMING HOUSES .

All the houses that are. on the ap-
proved list of remain» and boarding
places for College sturents, have been
inspected by the faculty committee on
student health, Dean Anna ii. Pierce an-
nounced recently. Standards that the

Committee members used in judging
whether a place was suitable for the
students involved the location of the

place, its iiearuess to College, its sur-
roundings and the pavement and clean-
liness of the street. 'l‘hey observed the
lighting facilities of the house, the size.
furniture, and numbetﬁof windows in
the sleeping rooms. They asked whether
the owner of a house had a piano and
if the students inigbt use it, and insisted
that there be a reception room in which
the women students might receive
guests. The committee members de-
clared that. it was the duty of the lamb
ladies to look after the moral life of the.
students. Students are allowed to live
in only approved house, which have no
other roomers or boarders.

“The committee's aim is to have sin~
gle beds for all of the students," Dean
l’iercc said. They are reachingr this
ideal by suggesting them to the land—
ladies.
