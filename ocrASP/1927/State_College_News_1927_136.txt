INTRODUCING THE CAMEL

lCutcr the Camel—An individual—leariled. distinguished,
and extremely confidential. It has been said that our friend
is very ltlt‘tlllletmtV—(lipplllg in here and there, searching
out all our motives and judging with interest our
ilf‘L‘tllllpllhllllllﬂllltit

It must be remembered, however, that friend Camel is
only a beast: plus four bit: hunts and two delicious humps.
And so. dear friend. don't be offended at what he s ’s. He
has a rare \L'llSl‘ of lniIiior—tho, camel-like, often dry.
He loves to argue. and nothing would please him more than
to havt- you dispute w 'il llL‘ . , s. For sake of convenience,
:nldrcm all rtiininiiiiiiations to the tiatiiel in care of the
vditor.

When l’rrtscl left dear old State, Minerva lost her
Poinpeiaii youth bloom, her cheeks and lips were Cal~
cimiued with hopeless anguish—(you can verify this
yourself); a murky gloom seeped through the corridors;
all students were steeped in funeral Iiielancliolia. That
year the Seniors graduach in black gowns—they always
have. Without eiiiiivocation, it is dark before the dawn.
Without equivoeation, those were dark days for State
and it's a straight road that has no turning.

Last year a gorgeously clever explorer strod through
the jungles wliiclt border the Congo. 'l‘ltis daughter of
Hibernia remembered the woeful condition of her

found expressed in the Inn words ll'lt‘lltir

girl who is friendly or wishes to he a
friend who can become a part of a fellow-
