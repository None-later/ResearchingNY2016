Where does the college girl spend her
Sundays? Skeptical folk who prate
about the frivolity ot the modern “co—ed"
might be surprised at the result of such
an inquiry among State College youth.
For not only does she go to church on
Sunday even to Sunday school atid
“Young People's" servicesl Witness the
existence of no less than nine College
Girls’ classes in as many different Sun»
day schools of the city, made up solely
of "State" girls, as well as various and
sundry Epworth Leagues, Christian Eu»
(leavor societies, etc., reeeiviug support
from this same college youth.

predominate in this census, perhaps be—
cause other denominations tind their
needs satislied in such Calltpns organiz -

that its prices are unusually reasonable.
although the vote for a live—cent sand—

cents. it is declared. Several students
think that the price should vary ac-

cording to the content of the sand—

would like to have priced according

INDIAN SCHOOL REPLIES
TO Y. W.C.A. DONATION

During the summer a letter came
State t'ollege for Miss Dorothy Watts
and was forwarded to her home at Sil—
vei' l‘iay. Although this letter, carrying
a stamp with the picture of a crowned
king ahove which was printed “'l‘hree
Amnis" and helow "lndiaii l’ostag‘e," had
already traveled a long way it had to
make another journey to reach Miss
\\’:itts who was at l'atnp Yonkers on
Upper 'l'win Lake in t'eutral Valley.

In the spring of this year, the 3'. W.
L_'._ A. cahiitet voted to send a donation of

Darjeeling, North lieiigal, India. The
donation was given through the inﬂu-
