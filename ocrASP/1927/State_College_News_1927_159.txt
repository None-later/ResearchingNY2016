The swimming team would have
been more at home last Saturday on
the St. Stephen’s cross country course
than the harrters.

 

 

The ﬂood waters were just
about ﬁfteen feet above normal
at the three mile post and nearly
washed away a trash who was
directing the runners around a
turn.

it was too bad we couldn't have
won the lirst run we entered this year
but the Saints had the better team.

On the start the last man t‘t‘ossint,’
the football iield was a Slate "Hill.

he looked around and saw a team of
while horses galloping along,r after the

pack. The horses were etter mudv

blind alleys and reverse turns
they laid out to fool us.
