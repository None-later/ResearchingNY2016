Cut No Class Before Vacation;
Faculty May Deny All Holidays

A warning has been issued by a
member of the faculty to students
seeking permission to cut classes
the day preceding recesses and va-
cations. Admitting that it is human
nature to endeavor to cut a single
class, and thus get home early, he
points out that such requests will
have a natural effect on the faculty.
If such requests are persisted in,
he told the Starr. (‘ni.i.i-u.i-‘. News,
the laculty reaction might be to
cease giving the present liberal va—
cations.

Many colleges give only Thanks-
giving day, or Thursday and Fri-
day, he said. State College gives
Wednesday afternoon. also. The
expected reaction would be to
shorten the State College vacation
to Thursday.

word to the wise will be sufﬁ-
cient, this faculty member believes.
Students will recognize that he has
pointed out the facts; that they can
keep their present system of re-
cesses and vacations only by

 

thoughtful consideration.

ASSEMBLY LISTENS 70
DR. BUCKINGHAM FRIDAY

The greatest loss in American educa-
tion is the failure to “carry on" what has
been learned in school and college into
later life, Dr. It. I\’. Buckingham, '01,
told students in the senitir-sophoinorc
assembly Friday morning.

ltr. ‘iiu'kiiigbain, who is director of
educational rest-arch at the (thin Slate
university was graduated from State
College nliru it n; ' normal school.

"Schools are like lat'tiirics, in that they
try to produce stunt-thing. \\'i- cannot
.sttn'c lllL‘ niainitat‘turt‘d product in damp
cellars, lint «duration is doing just that
ruinous thing," Ilr, lnckinghaiu told the
Iirst assembly.

“It is :in ii'I't-pai'a‘dr loss to let the
things you are now studying to pass.
It is the terminal loss iii education. The
loss due in poor equipment, tIri-rcrtiwilrtl
i‘ltt'wvs. and pour teaching do Hut com-
pare with it," llt' ileclai'id. Dr. ’itick-
