 CONGRATULATIONS INTERSORORITY!
LATEST RULING IS WISE

-.;.Thc Intersorority council should be congratulated on its
abolishing the scholarship rcqtiircmcnt for eligibility to
membership in a sorority.

The ruling is wise. in that it potentially bestows on stu-
dents who need it membership in a sorority. Sororities can
be a big factor in determining a girl's attitude toward ltcr
work. With the right hacking, and with the best possible
housing conditions that sororitics provide, more than one
"ige will hc spurrcd on to raise it.

 

girl with a low a

.\'o sorority is required to take as a member a stittlelll
who has a low average. tut if the student has similar
interests, and llL‘l’ personality is that requier by the par-
' let r organization, then she may be initiated

Responsih ty is placed on each sorority to maintain its
scholarship rating. The sorority's attitude toward scholar-
ship will he tested far more under thc new ruling than
under the old.

Dr. Brubachcr struck the keynote of the situation wl cu
llL' declared that sororities are not honor sot'ictics, but social
organizations. llc belicvcs that sorority lifc is valuahlc
that it adds to a student's education here.

And tlicrc‘is also a challenge to the sororities in the new
ruling adopted by its ltttcrsororit council. The challenge
it tiis ‘or the first time. sororitit. can provc whether or
not they do stand for the maintenance of scholarship.

Any comparison hitherto compich lictwccu the ratings of
sorority mcmliurs and indL-pcudcnt slttdt'tlts has been unfair
to the non-sorority girls. Sororities were given the pick
of the crowd, asiar , scholarship was concerned. No
student with less than a "(3" average could be admitted.

This docs not mean that sorori, averages will crash
flouhtlcss the (ire-ck lctter organizations will guard their
reputation, and will make cffort~~ to maintain their stainl-
aids. The student public will await with interest the
compilation of arcl'ttgus’ ncxt fall.

DREISERS’ "CHAINS" DEPICTS STRUGGLE
OF: MAN , DEVASTATING APHRODITE
By CairdWorrh ‘ '

Chain. By Theodore Dreiser. New York: Boni Live-
right. 425 pages. $2.50.

This is a collection of Dreiser's lesser novels and stories.
The most arresting story is Chaim. This presents graphi-
cally the futile trugglc of a man to break the enslaviug
bonds of his wife, an accessible, devastating Aphrodite.

St. Coliimba and The River, and Tim I’ri'iiu' li’liu War a
Thief demonstrate the versatility of Dreiser. Perhaps the
least impressive story of the collection is The [ltlll(l. This
is a psychological study of an obsessed man who is strangled
in a nightmare by his own hand. you contemplate
suicide, it would be well to consider this new. techinc.

The foreword is signiﬁcant, "The inevitabilities of our
fate are: Love and hope, fear and death, interwoven with
our lacks, inhibitions, jealousics and greeds."

Andrew Jackson, xiii Epic in [Imam/um.
Johnson. $3.50. 303 pages. New York:
Balch and Company.

And now it comes Andrew Jae-son's ttirn to be taken
down off the shelf of ponderous biographies and to bc
rewritten iii a popular-length, readable chronicle. He loses
nothing by his being dusted oFf; his lustre shines more than
ever. Mr. Johnson has written one oi the best if not the
one best, biography of the  i: ' tci"ations
of Jackson are in inaity ca, s epigrannuatir, cxtrctucly
quotable.

"The ticueral kicked rigltt lustily. lie was tht- most ltll-

of his imperious and dictatorial temper. Americam have
never known how to resist a. man who could talk like a

tive, indi. int-d, uncouth; but none oi tlww, nor the sum

force of the colloquialisin. 'l‘cnut-sscc was tough. . . .
From the viewpoint of 'l‘culicsscv. Washington wa» a \cry

It seems a bit unusual that an author who knows his
Jackson so well, should Iakc the president literally in his
rcgrets that he had iIo opportunity to "shoot llcury (th'l\'
or to hang John (I. Calhoun". \\'c ([llt'slltitl hi< runoii for
not placing it iii the same Category as the threat to slice
the cars off certain \ hingtontans.

Not only does the author know his Jackson; llt' is a
master of vocabulary and expression as w cll, 'l'ln- rhaptcr.
