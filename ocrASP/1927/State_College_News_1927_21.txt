Nephew ll Quick Change Artist,-
Win Actor, Athlete In A Night

The double role of an actor and
an athlete is that which Clarence
Nephew, ‘28 varsity basketball
captain was called tipoii to play
Saturday night. '

Nephew as captain had to be. on
haiid in the College gymnasium
for the game with (.larksnn loch.
As a member of tltt:_ cast which
acted "The (irand Chains Dia—
niond" a farce by Allan thiiik-
house, his presence was required at
the Albany institute of History and

rt.

The d'thculty was solved by post-
pouing the Clarkson game until
nine o'clock, and by placme
Nephew's play first on the bill at
the institute.

why one could not be played this

.\ self-imposed rule against usiin
tobacco, which lll‘ has never broken,
partly accounts for the abzlity of

Joseph H crney. ’2'), State's plie-
noincual guard, to hold all his

developed yesterday.

"I have never smoked cigarettes
our used tobacco iii any other
form," llcrucy said when asked
about the report, "(If course tllat
must help my wind. And it takes
wind to play basketball."

lvriiey said that his rnlc against

Some observers think the score
would be considerably affected by
the court on which the game would
be played. Admittedly Pharmacy
wou'd be at some disadvantage on
State's court.

Incidentally not a little of last
week's victory was dtic to the per.
faction by Coach Baker of a new
attack, especially designed for the
College court. A system of a quick
get-away from defense to offense
followed by long criss-cross passes
replaces the former method of
"working" the ball slowly down the
court and then attempting to pene-
trate the opposition’s defense.
