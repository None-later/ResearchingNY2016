HIS FAITH unconquerable, his passion for
work irresistible, his accomplishment not sur—
passed in the annals of invention, Thomas
Alva Edison has achieved far more than man—
kind can ever appreciate. February eleventh is
the eightieth anniversary of his birth.

Wherever electricity is used—in homes, in busi-
ness, in industry—there are hearts that are con—
sciously grateful, that humbly pay him homage.
