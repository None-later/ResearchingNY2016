to Mildred llaheock, exl'Zti, who will

llnr .\lerrill~l‘ahuer School came
into being through funds left by the
will of Mrs. Lizzie Merrill l’uhurt‘.
life purpose of its organization was,

women in the functions of wifchood

and super 5 on of homes, the quality
of which tlrtt'l‘llilnt's the welfare o'

“In planning a curriculum for this
school, it was decided to offer courses
at child development. acceptable
toward the degree reiptiremcut. attd so
organized that college students could
avail themselves of the special training.
