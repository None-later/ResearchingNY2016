"The fact is, that civili-
zation requires slaves.
The Greeks were quite
right there. Unless there
are slaves to do the ugly,
horrible, uninteresting
Work, culture and con-
templation become almost
impossible. Human
slavery is Wrong, inse-
cure, and demoralizing.
0n mechanical slavery,
on the slavery of the
machine, the future of
the World depends."

In a quarter-century the General Electric

Company has produced electric motors having
a total of more than 350,000,000 man-power.

produce quality goods at lower cost than any-

You will ﬁnd this mono-
gram on all kinds of
electrical machinery. To
insure quality, ask for it
on equipment: when you
buy for factory, ofﬁce,
or home.

Where else in the world.

A series of G-E advertise-
ments showing what
electricity is doing in
many ﬁelds will be sent
on request. Ask for book-
