Faculty Women Aek Sororities
Not To Limit Benefits
To A Few

 

Typical of the wave of faculty re—
action against the sorority policy are
the following two letters received this
week by the News:

You have asked for an expression
of opinion concerning the new ruling
of Intersorority council. I Would like
to hear frotn them a definite idea of
the advantage they see iii such a rul-
ing. On the surface it seems to fore‘
cast “a closed shop" for sorority activi-
ties which touch only a select few
girls at present.

Very truly yours,
ANNA l\':\N|I(lI.l‘ll Klan.
Assistant Professhr of Home
Economics.

I have your letter of lt'ebrttary l7th
asking for personal reactions tn the
Intersority decision regarding the or-
ganizatiou of new sororities.

I do not know very much about the
situation because of the Silence at" the
council, but my very definite (auction
is that of a question. If the . rority
members at State Colleut are sincere
in tlteir appreciation of the benetil‘ de-
rived from sorority life. why limit the
advantages in a few? It is perltaps‘
human nature for individuals to he
jealous of personal advantages. but it
is hard to believe that such an un-
social attitude would be £l>~lttttetl hy
a democratic group sueh as our State
College student body. There man
be other reasons which they have not
divulged, The lutetwrnrity eonueil
should certainly speak lit it< own ile-
fensc.

 

  
  

Very truly utrs.

The science of graphology is character analysis through hand-
writing - yours registers just what you are and can do. It can tell
if you nre majoring in the right subject.
