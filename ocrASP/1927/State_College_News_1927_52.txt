“'l‘he pre-sehuol |)el’|o(l in a child's
life is the most formative and preeari~
nus. It must he safeguarded hath edu—
cationally amt Inetlieally.” llr. Arnold
“0340”, director of the psyrho-elinit: at
Yale university, told {an audience at
Chancellor‘s hall, 'l'uestlay evening,

" child. during the lirst six years ol
his life, is not learnnu.I his A. It. his,
hat is rather learning the alphahet ol
lil'e," declared Ih‘. (iesell.

"tinting his early years. the child's
mind ,Ltt'ows ltlnt‘e quickly and tliiIl't' iu~
tenser than at any other stage of |it'e,'
he xplaated. "l'arents should aroid the
puss 'sire attitude toward their children.
and substitute op|mrlanities I'or derelop-
ment and growth, in plaee of the impo-
sition ol restrictions.

"'Ihe distinction helween the mind and
hotly is disappearing.” lir, iesell eon-
tinned. “The mind is losing its (lill‘ly
ethereal aspett ', and is heine' reckoned in
eouneetion with the hotly. eoncretely and
tanuihly. 'l'he pre-srhool period, as the
foundation for lite, is the most forma-
tive and precarious. It must he sale-
euarded edut'atinnally and medically,"
\tarned ltr. (iesel.

"Sen-nee is routine to take a donhle
interest in the ehild. mental and physical.
The physieal side heinu fundamental. Is
not Ininimiml. Mental hygiene is in-
tertwined with the physical.

“It is possible to get in toueh nith

"It is true that we cannot aslc a ehjld
