Mrs. Hale An Author

mother in Rachel Crothers' ‘lixpressr

thing's of th kind in the Amer .un
theatre."

'l‘he Ladies Home Journal said. “It
's allotted to few of us to write and
act well. Mrs. Hale is among the
unall group to whom this gift has been
awarded. Most of you never saw
be' as l’ro , in the tirst presentation
of George Bernard Shaw's andida'
on th side of the water, We did, and
we shan't erer forget it."

Since her stage debut as l'rossy in
George Bernard Shaw's "Candida"
Mrs, Hale has created many famous
stage personalities. \\"hen the New
York Theatre (iuild presented lbseu's
great drama "Peer Gym" it was
Louise ("lt' r l'lale who played the
mother, Asa. When Zona tale's
prize, winnitn.r play “Miss Lulu Belt
was lit-st produced on the stage it was
Louise ('losser l‘lale who played the
quernlous old mother, Grandma Belt.
In Eugene O'Neill's tirst long play to
re; production, “0n the Horizon.
Louise (‘losser Hale created the role
of the mother. Quite a dill‘erent
mother and now one of the oustanding
characters in recent stage literature
was the role in Rachel Crothers'
comedy \‘pressing Willie” which was
created In Mrs. l‘lale.
