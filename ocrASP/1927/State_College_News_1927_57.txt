Development Movement
A: Significant

Thinking teachers realize their work
is not limited to teaching reading, writ-
ing and arithmetic, btit that the soctal
life of the school

 

room and play-
ground could be
oite of the best

means of teaching
the essentials of
good citizenship,
according to I’m-
fcssor Florence E.
Winchell, head of
the home econom-
ics department.

"The citiltl de-
velopment and par-
ent etlucation move-
tnetit is bound to
set us thinking," Miss Winchell said.
"Of course mothers of growing children
are immediately aroused becatise of their
present problems. They never have ques-
tioned their responsibility for training
their own children.

"The old psychology, however, gave
them some comfort at discouraging per-
iods iii that heredity settletl irrevocably
much of the personality of the individual.
Whatever went amiss with tlte child
could be laid at the door of “an uncle
on his father's side" or “a queer streak"
in some other hereditary strain.

"The new experimental psychology, on
the other hand, is making a very ditTcr—
ent distribution of credit and blame for
the development of the individual per~
sonality.

"But now we find we must go still
further. livery mother knows that whal~
ever her skill and eilorts only achieve
in management oi" her children all may
go for nanglit because of the lack of
understainling of other members of her
family. lt‘ather, sisters and brothers,
grandparents, employed help, guests in
the home, all make tip the family life
tliai molds the child front birth. A
mother, however intelligent and pains-
taking cannot single handed do justice
to the training of her children. To get
results she must have the tnnlerstnnding
cooperation of all who come in contact
with the child.

“The study of family life as all edu-
cational situation is coating rapidly to
the attention of the pttblie. Clinics for
the examination of problems arising in
the lives of children front all types of
homes have been established in connection
with many colleges and universities.“

Writes on Theology

(3. Stuart Gager, '97, has recently
written a book, “The Relation llctween
Science and 'l'beology; flow to Think
About it." “it is well enough," Dr.
tiager says, "to leave it to the evolution-
ist to tell us whence we came and to the
theologian to tell us whither we are
going. Of course neither one knows
anything about it; but the scientist has
learned something about how we origi-
nated. if we are wise we shall eagerly
accept all that he cait tell us; it is none
too much.” Hr. (lager received his
doctor's degree frqu Cornell in 1902.

 

“Flaming College Youth” Version Not True
At State; Most Students Utilize Free Time

“Flaming college youth," is not quite
so hot as it is painted, according to the
average student at State College. While
college life is sometimes painted as a
four-year loaf with an occasional atten'
dance at classes, it' the student wakes
up early enough in the morning, a series
of all night parties and other social
events, the student body here is unable
to discover among its ranks any group
that is able to enjoy these spices of

ie.

More than 75 per cent of the student
body are in some way or another cm-
ploycd in free hours from college. One
ambitious youth is a substitute teacher
in the Albany High school every morn-
ing for five i'ull periods, instructs
Antericanization classes in night school,
teaches two history quiz divisions on
Saturday morning and still finds time
to attend classes and make his grades.

Several of the men students are em-
ployed as “soda slingers" in the various
confectionery eitiporinms of the city and
not a few are nurse-maids to furnaces.
One of the chief occupations of the wo-
men is what is known as “bullying” or

taking care of children in the afternoon
or evening when their mothers are en-
joying a few bonrs' recreation.

A large percentage of the women also
work for their board and room by cook-
ing, washing dishes or helping with gen-
eral housework in the homes in which
they reside and still others are employed
by the College at various capacities.
Sonic as 'ecretaries. others as telephone
operators and still others iii the cafeteria.

Several of the men are employed as
chauffeurs, one is serving an apprenttce~
5pr III a local printing establishment,
while others work in the laboratories
of the (,ollege arranging apparatus and
cleaning up alter the classes are through.
One young man is a recreational direc-
tor In charge of a group of boys.

Local newspapers employ students to
serve its correspondents to keep them
posted on the doings of the student body.

Almost every student at State has
three or four classes to attend every day
and to prepare for by outside study and
reading each night and very few, if any
students, hiid time to enjoy the gay life
