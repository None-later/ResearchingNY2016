MR. FALLON ON TRADITIONS AND BATTLE
I". rrou. 'rur: erw's:

I am sorely pcrplcxed. Should we have traditions or not?
If we should have lllcltt. how are we to tnforcc them?

The L'nitcd States Supreme L'om‘t is the shining mple
of a hotly whose orders are complied with. regardless of
the fact that there is no force in back of their orders to
enforce compliance, t 'cept the regard held for law by those
on whom the o l> are placed.

State College is It a similar situation to that of the Su~
prcmc Court. The t'ollcue, bcincr a stale institution. has no
power to t-nforcc anything concerniin,r extra-curricular acti—
vities. The only wcapon of enforcement in State College
is that of student body attitude.

The student body has allowed a set of traditions to grow
up. .‘\ good part of these traditions say what the freshmen
shall do. and SIHIII Hot do. 'I‘bc student body expects the
sophomore class to see that these traditions are abided by.
TI sophomore class has no means to legally enforce tra-
ditio 0f cutlrsc, olliccs can he taken at |\' from violators
of tradition. Inn who is tbcrc so bold as to no up and testify
against a fellow student? Speakim: in "a capacity.
there has been only Uttc complaint made to me about fresh-
men or rules. while it is a generally known fact
that [)rlttllL‘ltII)‘ all frcslnnen are not wearing their c: >

In order to refute any p ble opposition to my statement
that there is no legal way to enforce traditions. may I
qualify my statement by changing it to read that there is
no legal method which has proven practical. in this ('ollegc.

In order to impress upon freshmen the fact that trad
tious should be lived up to, sonic men in t‘ollcge took steps
other than legal to do the Illl|)l‘L'.\Sill_t[. Immed ly prolcsls
came in from tbt- Kll'ln. 'I'be “itiiprcswt‘s” accuscd of
terrible things, among others, of not being gentlemen.
'I'hesc sitme girls take great pleasure. in point; to the inter-
class fights on the l'nion cannius, and scrim: the freshmen
and sinibomorcs throw salt in caclt otbcrs t-yt-s, and paint
over cacb othcr's clothing. 'l'ht-y refute the point by saying
the I‘nion light an organized one on the t mpus, while
ours is a disorgaui d onc in our balls. ' I reply that
the principle underlying each light is the sonic.

’I‘In-rc will always be rivalry bctwct-n frcsbnn'n and sopho-
mores, and it is of the type that cannot be settled by “light-
ing it out with jelly rolls at ten feet."

No one is Inot‘c opposed to brutal ﬁglllltlt,’ than I am. bttt
how are we to enforce traditions? There is onc way which
works satisfactorily in most colleges and that is the atti-
tude of the student body towards the hr whiny,r of traditions.

MATE COLLEGE NEWS, APRIL 1, 1927

tiuns are desired at State College let everyone keep them.
If they aren't, there is always plenty of time during the
meetings of the student body to make a motion to abolish

Any suggestions as to how traditions may be enforced
will be gratefully received.

NEWS' JOURNALISM WORK VALUABLE.
WRITES CHRISTIAN SCIENCE MONITOR

 

 

 

 

[The Christian 51' nee Monitor, the "intermttiomtl daily news-
paper." published re ntly the following account of the Scott; CHI:
man; News on Its education [mum]

The workinlz,r uttt of an ideal of
publications of New York state has this year developed at
the State College for Teachers a form of journalistic
trainini,r that is rare, if not unique, in the III No jour-
nalistn cour. ' are offered by the College, but the under-
graduate weekly newspaper, the S'rA'rr. L‘oiaa .\‘tcws, has
undertaken to supply the lack by sttulcut-planned and sta-
dcnt~tanght courses in news writing and other futulamcntals
of newspaper technique. (iraduates of the College who have
bad the trainini.r oli’cred in these courses will‘ it is believed,
be far better titted intelligently to direct secondary school
newspapers and news magazines than litany teachers of
linnhsh and others who undertake the work without pre-
vious training.

'Ihe student stall of the college newspaper has been re-
crnitcd to nvarly ltlU members. 'I‘bese students fortn lltc
memberships of the classes. linrolhnent in all the cl'.’. '
except the most elementary one, is optional, and no L'ollcbc
credit is given for the work.

The elementary course is a study of the more funda~
mental ideas of news collection, news writil ' and news
evaluation. I"t‘csbititttt “In'elers” on the pap ‘l s stall attend
this course, at the same time doing the ct‘ ttssipmncnts
of news coverage. The course continues throuin the lirst
semester ol the College yt'ar.

In the sccoml .\t:lllt'\lt‘t', two other courses are t',l\'L'll. One,
in copy reading, pot-s tnorc dccply into we work of llc\\‘s
writing. atnl the copy reading work is takcn up with an
ctforl to obtain clt simple. and forceful lll'ust‘ writing. in
ilt“ 'daucc with aucptctl standards of news writing. 'I‘hc
po on of copy rcadcl', according to the editor in chief of
the paper "is not understood and oftcn nculcctcd on studcnt
'I'he cll‘ort is to makc it more than thc “countin-
ca that it so often is.

The third cont c is in beadliuc writing. l'bis comsc is
studied at unc- tinte and by about the same groups.
lleadlinc and copy reading on >1lltlt'lll \\ceklics are,
unlike the practicc on dailies. oftt-n ~cpa I: la. s and are
done by separate groups. The ltt'adlitn: course is based
around the double ftmction of tho ucwwpapcv caption. to
sum up in condcnsed form the t‘lllt'l f: is ol the news story
and to do so in such a tttattttcr. but without lent-ration or
