“Elephints n‘pilin' teak,
In the sludgy. sqndgy creek.
Where the silence ’ung that 'cavy
You was 'urt‘ afraid to spcnkl"
- Kipllng's “Mandalay”

ELEPHANTS

The elephant is man’s most intelligent helper.
But—consider this interesting comparison:

An elephant is much larger than the electric
motor of a “yarder” or logging machine. The
“yarder” has the power of twenty elephants; it
handles clusters of logs; it works dependably,
twenty-four hours at a stretch, if necessary.

Twenty elephants would eat daily 10,000 pounds
of green food, which a corps of attendants must
gather. A motor “eats” nothing but electricity,
supplied at the throw of a switch.

Two million elephant-s could
not do the work now being
done by General Electric
motors. Whatever the work
to be done, whether it needs
the power of an elephant or
the. force of :1 man‘s arm,
there is a General Electric
motor that will do it; faith.
fully for a lifetime at a cost
of u few cents an hour.

  

HENECT

Power used in the modern industrial world is
applied through electric motors—tireless
elephants” that are relegating antiquated ma-
chines to museums, along with such oldtimc
household articles as wash-tubs and ordinary
irons~and stuffed elephants.
