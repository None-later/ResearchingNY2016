THE PRESIDENT’S REPORT RECOGNIZES
VITAL CULTURAL NEEDS

A masterly survey of the t'ollcgc’s needs. phys
intellectual. Is contained in the annual report of the l"resiv
dent to the trustees. which is printed in this paper today.
The report is an important paper in the developnwnt of
State ('ollcgc. and the NEWS urges upon students the dc‘
'amiliarizing themselves with it.

 

l'ntsrno IIv I\III.I.s .-\Itr I'II:

" l and

 

sirahility oi

 

The document points to a prop.r . I\’(' program of de-
ve Ipmetn for this institution. it recognizes what the
Nt-zws has consistently tried to prove this year: that the

student body has gone to extremes in its zest for organiza—
tionk and for activities outside the classroom. lt attributes
to this and to two other causes many student failures.

The report, it is pleasing to note, shows that the (College
administration fully realizes the inadequacy of only a
scholastic standard in choosing frcslnncu. As this paper
said December Ill. 1026. “the real prohlem in connection
with the entrance retptirenlcuts is not that they demand
too high a scholastic standing, but that the scholastic staud~
ing is the only demand they do make." The report \\
recogni es the practival difﬁculties the College will en»
Counter when it attempts to add III it:- retlttit‘ctttcnls. but
it Cottr.’Igcously says that “the State College for ’l‘cachcrs
mu~t attack the problem lIoldly and L‘tlll.~lIlCllllUllbly."

.\lmt important of all in the report. however. is the tnth-
lication of the result of :1 survey made by the (‘ollt‘ge to
dvtcrtnitt- what are the chief criticisms voiced against its
product. 'l'wo criticisms called “noteworthy” are that the
l'ollcgc needs to t-Inphzt in» cultural material more, and
that the ('ollegc graduates often lack social ﬂuent-5.. II social
manner. a social reserve. llerc certainly are criticisms
which, if justified. demand the most anxious attention.
May it not he that the lack of “social ﬁneness" and “social
rut-w " it connected very closely with the need for more
cultural emphasis? The problem of how much education
of the liberal arts Iypt: and how much professional training
has been faced by this College from its earliest days. The
('ollege has been a pioneer is seeking the ideal proportion
of cultural and prof ional training for a teachers train-
ing institution. Evidently. it has yet to find the ratio near~
est perfection.

May it not he, also, that the over-cnnIhasis on
is one reason why State College graduates "lack a ‘somc-
thing‘ which the graduates of women's colleges have"?

There is a remarkable unity in the problems presented
in this annual report. The problem of whether the ('ol-
lcgc's product is all that it might he leads inevitably to the
prohlcm of how that product can he improved. 'I‘hat proh-
lcm immediately presents the problem of a better method
of choosing raw material the problem of better work with
the raw material while it is in t'ollcgc.

JAMMING THE CALENDAR

“Calendar jammed" w 5 part of the headli ‘- over a story
about coming activities in last week's Nuns. ’l'hc same
issue in this colttmn called attention to the temporary calm
in the 5a of college activities which existed last week-end.

('ertainly no one would wish that a similar calla prevail
every week-end in the year. Yet it would be equally as
unwise to wish that the calendar lttlllllllllt‘ to he “jannIIt-d”
in the future as it has in the past. Somewhere between
these extremes lies the solution of thc problem of activities.
The student body must sooner or later face the fact that it

is giving too niuclI time to non-productive activity. So
much energy is being expended in extra-curricular work
that much regular college study is necessarily neglected. -

A college without student activities would only partly
educate its students. But this College has gone far beyond
that stage. It has gone too far. Either the work of run»
ning student affairs must be divided among more students.
so that none will be over—Intrdcued. or sonic of the worlc
must he left undone.
