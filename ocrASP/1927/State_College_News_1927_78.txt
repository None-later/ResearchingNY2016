MEASURING STATE‘S PRODUCT

What does State College expect in its graduates?
l’rcsidcnt lirubachcr summed up the College's ideals not
long ago. None of the 270 members of this year's gradii~
tiling class, or, for that matter, of any itInlergratluaty
class, can neglect to check himsclf amt or he clt' with
these idcals. They read:

“A purposeful student who brings to the college a
resourceful, dynamic personality together with adequate
evidence of intelligence and scholastic achievement.

“A general cultural atid informational equipment as
the basis for the speci: ized training of high school
teachers.

“Professional training that will start lllc young to:
with the various skills that are ncct. 'y for sticct-~.'
schooiruom work.

“A scholarly mental habit that t'xprt-ssi-s itself in in»
tcllecttial humility and in eager scari'll for more knowl-
edge.

"A profu‘s‘ionai spirit iliat cxprc'ses itself in loyalty to
and co-opcralion with colleagues and in recognition of
the obligations of childhood aiul to state and nation."

"It is difﬁcult to inventory tlicsc spiritual qualities."
Dr. Brtibaclicr says. “.-\ self-suryoy is iiol fully satis-
faCtory and even leads to self~t‘omplacency."

STATE VERSUS UNION

Not only the sense of duty to support a College team.
but also the love of a good struggle between well-
matched opponents will lain: most of the student body
to Chancellor's hall tonight to hear the debate between
State and Union colleges. A subject of widc interest,
that of the advisability of adopting uniform marriage and
divorce laws in the United States, will be considered,
The Union team is coming to thc cud oi 2i long season.
It will ‘oc State's ﬁrst appearance in intercollegiate dc-

baling. The team will need and want the support of all
the College, Faculty and students will both want to be
there.

POLITICAL ARTISTS' FRAMED EQUAL
PAY SLOGAN, DR. BRUBACHERiWRITES

 

 

The popular slogan of "equal pay for equal work" as u
is applied to salaries of men and women school teacher.»
has little to conunch it from the professional point of view,
in the opinion of l’rcsidcut .\, l\'. lirubachcr, lJi'. liI'n-
bacher's yiew cuntaincd in a chapter on “Net, tire 'l'cii~

“The ‘eiiual p'ty for cqnnl work‘ slogan." l'rt'sidcut liru-
bacher writes, ‘was framed by political artists who under-
