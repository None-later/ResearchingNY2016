STATE COLLEGE ELECTS

Nolttiltntitms (J\t‘r, withdrawals heing announced, the
hens oi imiilitts homing; the student sociation and
three of the classes are about to elect their leaders for
the next school year. (Jandidacies are being discussed;
relative merits of the nominees are under consideration;
the "chancu" iii the various seekers alter oliicc are
being estimated. 'l'hroiigh it all is running a seriousness
oi purpose that is encouraging to those who have some‘
times felt that student elections might give good lessons
to professional politicians in "ways that are dark and
tricks that are vain." State (."ollegt: is going ahout the
I)ll§llll:.~5 oi choosing its new eXeentivi-s with a major
purpose of getting lIlt.’ tiesi students in utiice. Many
factors are living considcrml in determining which cati-
ilidale is host tor each Jul), and to minor degrees per—
sonal friendships and dislikes will enter. lint the domin«
ating spirit oi tltt‘ l'll‘l'llltll‘ is unintentionath worthy of
applause. .\'o ttt‘liult thi- student body takes is Inorc
impoi ant than the lilling oi its more important posts
of leadership. 'l‘hv i-li-ctions demand the carelul con-
sideration of everyone, and the welfare of student acti<
\‘itiI-s demand-i that everyone \ote in the student a550<

CONGRATULATIONS!

with a feeling of pride that the NEWS board an-
nounces today the names of thr- sIIidenIs who have been
selected to comprise the stall of this paper for next
year. The satisfaction is caused not by the fact that
the number of workers deemed worthy of promotion
exceeds that of previous years, but rather because the
seniors of the pr nt stall feel that capable, conscien-
tious, loyal hands me being entrusted with the guidance
of the student newspaptr, Those who have been pro-
moted have won their honors. They represent the best
of the scores of IIIOM.‘ who have tried for positions on the
Nicws. 'l'hey . rye the jobs they will have, and in
th :in they will have from all the College that encourag-
ing. whole-hearted support which the student body has
given so gi-Iierously this year.

 

 

 

ALBERTA WATKINS, ’29

For the third time since January, the College has
been shocked by the death of one of its students. There
will be a deep and widespread sympathy for the parents
and close friend.» oi Allierta Watkins. '29, whose death
occurred Monday, Similar sympathy has hcen loll lor
the l‘t‘lr’lll\(‘s of Mildred Schedule, '30, who died in Janu-
ary and of \‘iyian laechus, '27, whose death occurred
last month. All three young women were liked and
respected by their classmates and other fellow students.

 

 

"PLAYGOER" LIKED TROUBADOURS l

 

'l'he 'l‘rouhadors got oil it) a ﬂying start in their min-
strel show Friday night. "State's linest" played to a
packed house all set to chuckle appreciativcly at the
slightest prm'ocation (not that the 'l‘rnuhadoura failed
to furnish many and varied omiortunities).- On the
contrary, the opening circle supplied plenty of wise

 

qulps, some peppy songs and enough rollicking side-
Dilly. to keep everyone amused. Alexander Arniug‘s
bass 5010' showed a remarkable range and was much
appreciated. Michael 'I'cpctliiio's dancing and his work
as cndmau also Caught the popular fancy and resulted
in enthiuiiitstic encores.

In part two, Tepotlino again gathered in the laulllltl
as It graceful Spanish maiden in "Sunny Spain" and as
the "hard-boiled" chorus coach in "Naughty Jaria.”
'l‘hc "imported chorines,” by the way, were certainly
unique in COSltttltc as Well as interpretation. "Dixie
Land," the lirsl number of part two ol'lorcd some rather
line quartet work by Arning, (IohI-n, (Ironnse and Shil»
linglaw.

Lloyd Fishbaugh in “Bonnie Scotland." riralled llari‘y
Lauder with his excellent Scotch dialect and pleasing
voice.

The one-act comedy, "Good Evening Uncle. lieu"
distributed honors pretty generally among the members
of a rather largo cast. Davis Hhulte as M s. Jones,
however, tlrcw lirst place as a laugh-getter. (.‘lai‘i-nre
Nephew and Joseph Herney Worked up a few good
comedy lines. Stage groupings, hound to ho diﬂieiilt
with ten characters, seemed to result in few entangle-
ments. The scene opening with the entrance of Uncle
Ben was notahly good in grouping. The general tone
of the whole performance lacked spontaneity somewhat.
but it certainly jtislilics the life of the ’l‘rnuhadntirs as
an organization.
