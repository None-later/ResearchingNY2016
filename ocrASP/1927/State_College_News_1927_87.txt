-" .’ r STATE AND SHAKEPEARE

The College is watching with more than u~tla| inlereit
as the preparations advanCc for the first playing of Shakes—
peare here in solne ten years or more. "The Tempest" is
the vehicle which has been selected by Miss Mary (irahn,
the director, and by the advanced dramatics class. in pre~
scnting Shakespeare to a modern audience, problems arise
which are more diflicult aml more numerous than those
associated with the presentation of modern dramas. in
playing “The Tempest," this is particularly trite. The play
has never been prominent in the repertoires of Shakes-
pearean actors. Various reasons have been advanced for
thiS. Some say that it lacks the emotional appeal of
others of Shakespeare’s comedies; this is doubtful. Others
say it is, dramatically speaking, less effective; certainly to
be good theater it must be played well.

A third reason may, it seems, he that it does not offer
the type of lead role that appeals to the gre
These men and women very often prefer a play which
oil’ch a leading role that stands out more above the other
parts than is trite of any character in “The ’i‘cmpest." ’i‘his
fault, however, becomes a virtue when the play l.‘ given
by amateurs. liettcr work may be expected when there is
relative equality in the roles than when an amateur is too
greatly burdened with a "star part." The advanced dra<
tnatics class seems to be performing a service in reviving
this pic it has not been given, prof stonally at least,
in America for ten years or more. it is given infrequently
by amateurs. A revival at State. College will serve as an
agreeable change froln plays of the twentieth century,
besides helping to keep alive an entertaining classic.

Students anti lhcatcrvgoing Albany generally are looking
forward expectantly to June 3 and 4 when Caliban, l’ros<
pero—and, of course, Ariel—«will walk the boards.

 

 

   

BUSINESS - LIKE

The College owes another debt to the finance board in
general, and to Professor Clarence A. llidlcy, its faculty
treasurer, in particular, for the large increase realized
through investment in the fund for the athletic field. Pro-
fessor llidley’s careful investment of the money donated
to the fund, totalling about $2,000, has enabled the board
to announce a profit of fifty per cent, bringing its total
fund to nearly 53,000. To do this in a few years, and to
do it in safe securities without any chance of loss of
principal, is unusual. it is an additional instance of
the sound and thorougiigoing ert‘k done by the finance
board for the student body, ofth without adequate recog-
nition and sometimes even without adequate support. The
board and Professor llidlcy deserve thanks.

TEACHERS' SALARIES
ii‘roln 'I'he Knickerbocker I‘l't'r‘rt

'l'hc optimism of Professor Saylcs of State College for
Teachch on the subject of teachers’ salaries is pleasant
to hear, even though the public still has the spectacle of
some shocking payrolls before it. Mr. Sayles believes
the rewards of education are increasing and will continue
to increase at a faster rate in the next ten years. livery
teacher and every thinking citizen will hope devoutly he
may be right.

If there are any two classes of citizens which should
be recruited from the best minds of the country, they
are the groups which have charge of the education of the
nation‘s youth and of the administration of the people's
affairs, the teachers and public ofﬁcials of the city, state
and nation, Yet these two classes are so conspicuously
underpaid that month after month they lose the services
of their most able members. College professors with
years of economic research lichin them soon sell their
services to corporations for live or six times the stipend
paid by the universities. Public Officials who have dem-
onstrated their executive ability cannot decline the op-
portunity to multiply their salaries many times by be~
coming executives of private rather than public affairs.

This is a condition so old that it should have been
remedied long ago. Yet the Governor still directs the
management of the state for a salary approximately
one-eighth of that paid to the president of a single com-
pany within the state, and professors guide the intel-
lectual lives of hundreds of young men and women each
year for pay which often is less than the clothes allow—
ance of their pupils.

The disparity between tbc rewards for public and
private activity is so enormous that it is suicidal. Soon
there will not be a single young man of ability who will
dare face the financial starvation of public life. Pro»
lessor Saylos sees improvement; it has barely started.
