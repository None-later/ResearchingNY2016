That is tlte question which is on
the lips of ererrnne at State College,
as llt‘ annual observance of Moving-
Up day, May Ell, grows nearer. [\t
that titue the new members of the
senior honor society will be "tapped"

tips," logic, and ereu dreams are
being 'alled into work by students who
want to determine in advance just
which of the present juniors are to be
honored. lileren, tu‘elre pr thirteen
are chosen annually to be members of
the group. which gurt-rus all student
aetitities ltut until the actual mn-
tnent ul "tapping" entries, none but the
retirint.r members know many
are to be selected.

Results oi student elections and
totes (ll all sorts are being watched
elnsely by the pulittrally interested,
as litthsllilt' indlenturs ut some ut’ those
whose ehanres might be considered.
Records are being rumparetl, aml the
annual eustum pl "making lists" has
already started. This custom consists
of the pretutratipn by students not
members at Myslcauiu of sets at names
at the persmts whom they think will
be those chosen, the object being to
 who can come closest ‘0 a correct

More than 60 per cent of the mechanical
power used by American industry is applied
through electric motors. But the electriﬁ-
cation of the tasks performed by man power
has hardly begun. Electric power not only
saves dollars; it conserves human energy for
better purposes and raises standards of
living. College men and women may well
consider how electricity can lessen the bur-
dens of industry and of farm and home life.
