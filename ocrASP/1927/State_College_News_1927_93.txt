Collins combines a me trio of talents. [-[e is tirst of all

says, that the greatest pitfalls of sex are those of igllol'allee.
and he explains much that has been nlisutldet'stooll and mix-

The subject matter of “part Iwu” of the book adulits of
a less objective treatment, bllt one that is profoundly reads
able. There is a discussion of adllll illfalltilis'ln, Wllit‘l) lil‘.
