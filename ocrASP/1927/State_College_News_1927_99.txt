A WISE ACT

The student body has done ivcll in referring to a C(liii-
mittee a consideration of a more dclinite statement of
Myskania's duties and powers. Such a statement, incorpo-
rated into the constitutions of the association and of Mys-
kania, will do much to clear up a situation which is now
very much open to the attacks oi sincere objectors and
agitators alike. .\lyskatiia's manifest desire to do the real
will of the student body shows that it will welcome the
work of the committee As has been argued, the Mys-
kania side of the (iilliciilty out of, which some students
have been trying to make an issue, is much less known and
appreciated than is that which has been more widely adver-
tised. As a result of Friday's discussion, both stiles oi
the argument are now pretty much before the student
body. The student committee, the College will expect. Will
make a detailed investigation of stillicient intensity and
length to determine and state with some exactness just
what are the Myskaiiia prerogatives and just lioiv the
student body can best have its will executed in the election
of Myskania members.

 

RING’S "WONDER MAN” DlSAPPOlNTS;
ORIENT REVOLTS AGAINST THE WEST

 

 

 

The Story of a Wonder il'lrm, Being llic_/littabi0gmplty
of Ring Lardner. $1.75. New York: Scribner's. I

"Like all of the books of Ring Lardner," we are iii-
formed by the blurb, “this one can be taken in a number
of different ways. For instance, it can he read as an
enchantineg rare piece of fantastic imagination; or as
a biting burlesque upon autobiography." etc., etc.' Inurcd
as we are to lilurbs and their little exaggerations, we
admit to having found this particular outburst consnler-
ably more entertaining than the book itself. Lardners
humor appears largely forced in his “biography”; there
are some good passages which make the book worthwhile
to those who are willing to iiiuit for them. lint most of it
is rather poor stuff, especuilly {rpm one who has demon-

strated the capabilities ﬂat in ' ' has.

 

Tish Plays the Game. By Mary iicrts Rumba“, New
York: Dom. _

The newest “Tish” book, on the contrary, is one to read
behind closed doors, and by‘yottrself, for it you try, it
when others are about they will suspect your sanity, 9“
will have to laugh as the Incredible, marvelous exploits
oi the prodigious Tish multiply under 'the spell of Mrs.
Rinehert's pen. it is all very nonsensical, of course, if
you are particular about having SeliSG'ill all you read,
But the affair of the baby blimp, the little adventure of
the treasure hunt, and the various other episodes prove
all one could ask in the way of very light; cuterwmmem'
