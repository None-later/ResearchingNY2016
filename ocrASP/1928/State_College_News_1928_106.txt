ing to general reports gathered from the htudent body and the faculty.

The majority of students, front freshmen to seniors, including,r members of
Myskania, the college honor society. seem to think that the “get-wise" parties
are infantile and crude, Very few exceptions to this opinion were found among
the students and none among the faculty. One freshman especially expressutl
himself rather strongly, though anonymously, against the “get-wise" party held
in the gymnasium of the college last Friday nigit.
