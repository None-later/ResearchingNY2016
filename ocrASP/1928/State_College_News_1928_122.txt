An alumna of State College has what
is believed to be the record for long
term service as a teacher with a mini-
mttm of absence from her duties.

The alumna is Miss Sarah Maybee,
of Huntington. who recently retired after
ﬁfty-seven years as a teacher in the
primary school. During this period of
service, Miss Maybee was absent but
one day. This was ﬁfty years ago, when
she ltad "chills and feavcr" and :t physi-
cian forbade her to go to school.

"The doctors I have had since then
often tried to keep me away front school,
but I never listened to them," she said
“i just went ahead and taught my pupils.
and my health took care of itself. l
nercr went to bed early, either."

Miss Maybee was as durable a
boarder as she was a school teacher.
for she has occupied the same room lor
tifty .even years in a little frame house
tll New Street, in l'luntington, nestling
under towering spruces and sweet with

 

honeysuckle and rambling rosm, Here
the straight~shoulderetl, lfllltllyw'ltltl'll
teacher sat on the sun-lierked front

porch recently and told I‘L'llurtet‘s about
her plans,

“i thought i should retire now while
i still have energy to enjoy my leisure,"
she said. “I have long been an active
worker in the (‘entral l’rt-shyteriau
(lunch. and i shall look forward to
taking a more energetic part next winA

 

 

ter. Yes, I suppose I shall miss my
pupils, but after all. practically every-
body itt town has been my pupil, so i
shall have them with me wherever I
am.

Miss Maybee was born ill llrockrille,
but received her education at [last Nor-
wich and the Albany and ()swego Nor-
mal Schools. The Albany Normal is
now State College. She went to llunt~
ington in 1871 to substitute and has held
the job erer since, though many years
ago she was promoted to the post of
supervising principal of the Main Street
primary school. The Board oi liduea—
tiou of Huntington has titlnptetl unani-

‘mously a resolution praising her career.
