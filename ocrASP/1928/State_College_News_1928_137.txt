FRESHllllll. SET NEW
$675 DUES RECORD

Only 40 Members Fall To Pay
Assessments, Rutsnber
Announces

 

The freshmen class has collected $675,
in- clas dues, in spite of the fact that
dues have been increased. This sum
shows an increase over the attempts of
any-previous freshman class. Approxi-
mately 260 persons have paid their dues
according to Curtis's Rutenber, freshman
treasurer. There are still about 40 yearl—
ings who have failed to pay their as-
sessmcnts.

“A great deal of credit belongs to my
snlmrdiuates, Evelyn Pitts, Mary Alex-
ander, Marjorie Lockwood, Katherine
’I‘raver, Marion Nelson, Anna Goldman,
Helen Mead, and Josephine Wilson,"
lx'ntenher declared today. ‘

Notices have been placed in the mall
box of each freshman requesting him to
Colth at some time between 1!:45 and
1215 o'clock to one of the four rooms
asigued for the purpose of paying: his
dues. 'l‘bese notices have been dis
ll‘lllllltll four times to date. Un \Veih
uesilay one more set of notices were dis-
tributed.

in the method of collection formerly
used by the freslnnen class, the treasurer
was given a desk in the rotunda where
the fees were collected.

 

 

Professors Are Hunted At Home
While They Hunt For Squirrels

B-r-rl goes the alarm clock atﬁve
o’clock each mornng. A slight
bustle, a silent house, and then
hours later an anxious hunt for
father.

That‘s what’s happening in the
homes of several of State‘s pro-
fessors now that squirrel season is
at its height. I

Yes, squirrel caps are gomg to
be popular among the male mem-
bers of the faculty this winter. The
cold gray dawns are ﬁnding them
frisking through the woods and
pooling the results of their con-
quests that that cars may be kept
warm when the cold blasts of win-
ter come.
