“MANY 1'\ MICKLI.‘:—"

The Y. M. C. A. and the Mathematics Club seem to be
more or less perturbed over the editorial policy u the
News in citing those two orgamr'itious as contributing to
the growing cost of studcnt ilL‘llYlllt‘S here. [he latter
denied in the last issue of the NEWS that it had recently
raised its dues. But the larger point remains: the dues
were formerly ﬁfty cents a ycar, according to lllLZ‘C'lllb'S
constitution. They are now Sixty cents a year. us is
an increase. 'I‘o quarrel over a dime a year may seem to
be next to the ridiculous. The only justiﬁcation is tin-
old provcrb that many a micklc makes a niuckle.

Now for the ’. M (I A We do not (Illu.ll(lll.lllt2 nio-
tivcs oi the organization. We do not tpicstion its value
to students here. It probably serves a need for. a certain
number of men students. If it meets these basic criteria,
then its existence is justified. V .

But the point is this. arc the members so iinpectiiiious
that they cannot pay [or what they get out Oi it! I tist
an organization be less religious if it supports itscll? ‘llocs
the Y. .l‘l. C. A. differ so radically from the Y. W. L. A.?
The latter is self supporting; the former is avowcdly not
self supporting. Many of the items in thc budget are prob-
ably justiﬁable. liiit wc again ask the assocuition ll it
should .1.» contributions to iced itscll refreshments?
\l'ould it detract from the purposes of the association for
the members to feed thcmsclycs? I

The association is probably doing a worth while service
in conducting a dinner for the freshmen. lint necd the
diiincr bc II c? The two diniwrs for men in other years
werc, we believe, paid for by the raters. Were the dinners
any less eiij "tlilc licctittsc of this? .

The ssocmtion occasionally sponsors a speaker for as-
semblies. .r\ fund for this purpose exists in the student
association budgct. Need the Y. l\l. L‘. A. take ovcr‘a dtity
oi sitidcnt association olliccrs and then point to this task
ttn' a jlts‘lilit‘atioll for ' g money? lf lllt‘lllsﬁtltllllltlil
wants to hear lln' speaker, will it not pay his expcnses.
rather than have them paid by tho collection cup method?

lt docs, \tc llullt'VL', detract from tlic high aims and
ideals of thc Y, M. (j. A. to have the collection plate t'Vt‘l'
in the immediate background, casting a somber shadow
over its :tCil\‘liit.~. ‘

lut partisans have takcii the citation of they. wo or»
gaiiizaiions lls attacks upoti lllL‘lll. TIN is not
the aim of the N . The particular citations w'crc list-d
nit-rely to show tlic growing cost of l:.\’li':iCtti'l‘lCtlltll‘ ac-
tlvitics lici'c, and to show tln- adv s iilily oi calling a halt.

State (follcgt- should iiii its I‘cpltllllliiIl—mtilltl it is a
sterling reputation thus ' being a place whi-rc any
student may afford to take part in any activil' 'ind whurc
stitdcnts are not cmbarasscd by t'rcipicnt soli itions I'or
Iinaiicial lhdnlitllt't'. 'l‘bis is llir point that should bi- krpt
in iiiiiiil. '

ll wc could gi't this point across without Ilt-liiiitt: cita-
lions, wc should do that; and if we could gi't it across
bctlci‘ by morc citations, tic should do that. lt is the point
that matters, not llll‘ tot-s trod upon \\llllt' making lllt'

Many have been the attempts in recent ycars to write

l)r. Heard. the eminent historian, has gathered in this one
book the opinions of sixtccii widely known writers and
sociologists on the future of mankind, The rcsult is a
thought-provoking, stiinulative ulltl unusually brilliant piece
of work. Each writer is a specialist in his licld; I‘Imil

the family, race and civii tioii, arts, play and liicraturc.

The future of mankind is bright in its machinc :tgc,

This is a study to discover the pruscnt status of history
teaching in clcmcnttiry and secondary schools, with sug-
gestions [or the improvement of testing in those liclds.
Two problems arc trusty/cred: “What do lt‘itt'llt‘l'ﬁ expcct
their pupils to know at the comph-tion oi a course in his
tory?" and "How is this knowledge rrlatrd to the recog-
iiizcd aims, purposcs and t'tiltn's of hisioi'y traching as set
up by experts in thc licltl oi history?"

From information compili-d by it nation \\ltlt‘ lt‘nL‘ﬂl‘Cii,
the author concludes that “scvciity ioiii‘ [lt'l' cciit oi our
work in history consists in teaching the pupils to read
and rcincnibcr tlw tt-xtbook records. We me still
