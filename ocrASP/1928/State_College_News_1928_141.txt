Miss I’utterer remarked.

Atss Futterer made her summer
home in a small mining camp called
Creed in the heart of Colorado. She
experienced real outdoor life, ﬁnding
horseback riding an ideal sport. ‘ht'
town of t'reed." she explained, “was
one of the important places of settle—
ment durim.r the days of the gold rush.
However. weather conditions pre»
rented it from becoming a large city.
t is reported that during the ﬁrst
winter ot the settlement. more than
live hundred prnple died from the cold
of the severe winters."

Miss It'utterer. on being questioned
about the people living in (freed. said
that the miners were made up almost
entirely of foreigners who found their
t-hiel pleasure in gambling during the
leisure moments. The lite, of the
miner, on the whole, is a hard one.
and gambling lll‘l‘st‘lllh the lust means
of diversion. she eunrluded.
