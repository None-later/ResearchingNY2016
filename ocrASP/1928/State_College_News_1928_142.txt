By DR. A. ll. Ilium-truck

The schools oi England, France and
Germany have much in ClllllIlIUIl, They
divide their educational program into
three parts aiitl in approximately the
saute place. The elementary pt-riod con-
tinucs from about live to eleven years
oi age; the tniddl period lrtim eleven ‘tti

 

eighteen years og age. and the higher or
advanced period, which includes protus»
sinnal schools and lIlIl\'L‘l'.~lllL“~', trtim
eighteen years upward.

They also agree, iii making attendance
in the clemciitary period compulsory,
while the middle and higher schools are
highly selective in forming their student
hotly atl attendance is. oi course. voluuv
tary. There are many other points of
likeness which will appear in a com:
parisou of their educational practice.

Stress Fundamentals

The elementary school in the linropeutt

countries and especially iii linglaud car-
rics a program which is more like the
American elementary school program
previous to 1900 than our present pro-
gram; that is, the liiiropcan schools have
not enriched their schools as much as we
have, by the inclusion oi such subjects as
elementary science, artI liaiitlwork. and so
on. They still give the prii 'ipal emphasis
to the fundamental subjects in the mother
tongue, number work, geography and his»
tory.
The work is probably done as well but
no better than the elementary work iii our
own schools, littt there is not the smite
tlrive apparent to bring all children tip to
the same standards of achievement.
There is not tittite the same universal at
tention l“ the personal health of the cltil-
tlren that has l)L'('I| such a prominent
feature in American education in recent
years.

At the end of the eleventh year the
presumption seems to IJL‘ tltat most til the
children will drop school and ﬁnd their
places in industry. As a Ciillst'ttllcllt‘t’ one
