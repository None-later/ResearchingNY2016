The varsity basketball team staged a
successful opening for its season Friday
night. defeating the St. Michaels college
tosscrs by a 31-18 count. The playing
form displayed. by the Purple and Gold
players was, nothing to enthuse about.
In fact; the boys played a 'very poor
game during nearly the entire contest
and were lucky that they didn't give the
game away. The game was marred by
the way the boys would hand the hall to
their opponents time after time. I

In the second half the State College
routers were given the pleasure of see-
ing Tony Knezynski play the brand of
ball of which lie is Capable. In that
period he sank live ﬁelds and was the
heart of the State College otfensc and
defense also. In all. Tony scored twelve
points on six ﬁelds. Captain‘ Heriiey
scored seven and Carr rang up six points
although he didn‘t play his best game by
any means.

Visitors Score First

The visitors took the lead at the start
when they scored from the field after
about a minute of play. Shortly after
Carr evened the count by sticking one
in from under the basket. The score
was close for nearly all of the ﬁrst half.
Si. hlicliaels held its last lead at 0-7 but
it didn't last long as Kuczynski tied the
score again with a pretty two pointer.
State went ahead from that point and
was never again seriously threatened.

The second team played the last few
minutes oi the first half and held a
15-10 lead at the intermission. in the
second half the first team returned to the
game and outplayed its opponents all the

way even though the men did fumble a 3

lot and pass wildly.

Carr, who appears to be in poor shape
for a hard game. as do some of 1
others too. was relieved by Carpenter in
the second half and Lyons went in In
place at? Carpenter a little latch This
period was featured by Kuczynski's sen«
national work.

Guards Work Together

(inc thing good about ,the boys' work
was the pleasing way in which the two
first string guards worked together.
Hcrney and Winston are as smooth part-
ners in the guard positions as State has
had in the last few years. Lon Klein
took a lot of punishment in the game.
in the first few minutes he was knocked
oi? his feet half a dozen times. it seemedf
