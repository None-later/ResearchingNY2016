\VHAT ARE TRADITIONS?

A clear deﬁnition of Cullch traditions is needed. as is
shown by recent tilts between the frcsiuiian and sophomore
It woitld scent that certain members of the stu-
dent association can not dis uguish between college tradi-
tinns zind sophomore rules. The difference is great: it is
the difference between obligation and imposition.

College traditions ltrc the property of the whole student
body. They should he observed by all. They should be
enforced by Myskaniu, which is dttly authorized to enforce
them. They should not be interpreted its license for battles
between freshman and sophomore classes. A college tritdi-
tion should command the respect and obedience of (ill. as

classes.

 

long as it is :i tradition.

Sophomore rules are .1 different matter. Sophonuirc
rules exist :15 ii direct challenge of the sophomores to the
freshmen. it is t)\‘t‘l‘ these rules and other conduct of the
two classes that scraips should originate. Traditions should
not form (t basis for intercluss scraps. Myskztnia alone
should enforce traditions. As long as it zillows prmniscnns
enforcement of traditions, just that long will the traditions
llt.‘ chcztp and poorly regarded by freshmen. And if My-
skzmizi does not cure to enforce traditions, it should recom-
rncnd their abolition to the student association. Those who
feel keenly on the subject. should report infraction of tradi-
tions to Myskzuiiii, which will, We feel sure, put into effect
the recent ilL'l of the student association in giving it power
to enforce traditions,

In the mczintimc. the sophomore class has not been con—
sllllllL‘ll rt strong zirm of enforcement. It has made one
niisstcp in iurcing upon it ireshmnn tlw punishment for
lirvuking sophomore rules, when rcnlly she broke traditions.
Miss Blcckcr may feel justiﬁed in demanding an apology
from the sophomores. And if justice were In prevail, the
sophomores would ochr \llL‘ apology. l’crhttps it will be.
better to leave the matter as it now is; but in the future
the sophomores should constrain thcnisclvcs to their rules;
zuid not infringe the rights and obligations of .\ly.~.kzniiu.

Despite the threat of President Lincoln to hang them its

jcf’fcrsou Davis. Willi the prospects of it quick road to
\VCilllll and lit the slime time of rendering at service to the
Confederacy. the private smen took over numy pructicully
worthless hulks and started on their adventures.

Not until the publication by Yale University Press of
TM Cull/alum” I’i'ir'rllvw'x “its this phase of the war been
touched upon adequately. 'l‘he nntny books on the war
referred to the privatecrsmen but incidentally. and gave fur
more praise to the blockade runners. an entirely diﬁ‘crent
form of enterprise. But it was the privatecrsmcu who
caused a pillllt‘ in Northern shipping circl . and who caused
many Union lucrchuntincn to be transferred to foreign
registry.

Beginning with a discussion of the Declaration of Paris,
the author gives a thorough and scholnrly account of thr
privntccrs. 'l'hnngh writing from it Southern point of view,
he iidnnts tbzit tlw days Hi |)r‘i\'.’tlcul‘lltj.'. \t‘t't't' pnst before
the war begun.

The book has all the thrills of st‘n Will'lIll't‘. 'l‘hc Snlhu

with action. The book is n welcome addition to the Yale

Every American citizen should h:iVe n thorough knowl—
edge of the constitution under which hc lii'cs,’ he should
know the powers of the national government its contrasted
with those of tilt" state; he should know the source from
which the constitution sprung, This is one of the basic
criteria for the good citizen.

While this text till the Constitution docs not present the
document in any new or startling light, it does present it
in a straight-forward, thorough nizn icr. Starting with
the backgrounds of political and social democracy in the
colonies, thc autl‘rir lends the reader through the revolu-
tionary and criticrl periods to the calling of a convention
zit Philmlclpbizi. Nightly, the greater part of the book is
given over to the constitution and its :iiiicntlnicnts. (Jiie
good fctiturc is the placing of the port of an amendment in
the szimc chnpter in which it is discussed.

One might wish for :i more thorough account of the
compromises of the constitution, which are barcly men—
tinned. This cutting of the compromises is probably the
penalty to pay for such a con is book of but 3.20 pages.
The adoption of checks and bulluiccs is ittlcllllillt‘ly intrr-
prctcd. Lists of -n|ip|cnicntztry readings and n few selected
questions on the c nslitntiun are appended to Ouch chztptcr.
This would make nu excellent handbook for the use of
students.

European education places more re»

more freedom lllilll is the practice ii
American schools "here are not 5
many and so frequent cxtuniuutions:
there is not the requirement of attend-

test coining zit the periods indicated,
numcly, at the eleventh your, the six-
lt't'lllll year, and the eight t'lllll yezir.

In between these periods the student
is thrown on his own resources it good
detil mill is required to educate himself
in a sense that is quite unknown to tht:
American school boy Illltl girl.

This cluirlicteris c runs through thc
entire scheme of liuropcnu education.

tures and laboratories and class periods.

This is the pructicc ill xford and

:quulify for the bur examination u stu-
‘dent must have catch it prescribed num-
