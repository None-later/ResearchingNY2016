Administer examinations
In Albany Schools

An extensive project in administer-
ing educational tests has been mapped
out for his education courses by Dr.
Earl l5. South, assistant professor of
education, and is being executed by
students in his classes.

The tests are being administered in
the Albany public schools, in the Al-
bany Academy for Girls, the Albany
Hospital, Albany Orphan Asylum and
in the grade and high schools at
Speiicerport.

The inclusion of this program in the
Albany public school system is rcv
gardcd by members of the education
department as a signal achievement,
since the theory gained in classlis ap-
plied in the actual administration of
the tests. This is the ﬁrst year that
college classes have administered tests
in the local schools,

Tests at Academy for Girls

Students from both Education 112
and [USA have been helping test 150
pupils from the Albany Academy for
Girls. State College students may
continue to work in co-operation With
the academy in helping keep the test
records tip to date. These students
have also participated in the testing
program of the nurses training class
in the Albany Hospital. Mrs. (mic.
view: Clark, who attended summer ses-
sion here last summer and who is a
member of the state nurses cxaiiiina~
tion board, is interested in making-a
study (if the nurses training classes in
the hospital and the St. Joseph's Hos-
pital, Certain intelligence tests,
achievement tests and personality
measures are being usud in the study.
These measures are similar in type to
those which are being used in the
study of the freshmcn at State College.

Problem Cases at Asylum

Tests which were begun last year
in the Albany Orphan Asylum have
been continued this year. The number
of students thus far tested in this in-
stitution. including the work of both
years, is about seventy. The material
obtained from the asylum has been
very helpful as problem and case ma-
terial in Education [05A, according to
Dr. South.

Children at the orphan asylum may
be used as subjects for special tests in
the two courses, according to Dr
South. In other years, when the
rlnsscs wished to administer such tests
its the Stanford-Ilium. it was found
dillicult to obtain subjects.

The class in education ll2 is doing
the greater part of the work. It is
composed of thirteen nppercl; suit-ii
and graduate students. This class has
given test in computation with llr. C.
Edward Jones, rity superintendent of
schools, and John H. Kingsley, rc‘

The visitors failed to account for a

the first half and the ﬁrst ten of the
second. Tony Kuczynski and Captain
