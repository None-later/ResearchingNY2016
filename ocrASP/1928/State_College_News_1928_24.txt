Residence Hall May Be Built Unit By Unit;-
“Would Relieve Housing Conditions”--Stafford

The residence IiaIl of State College
may be litiilt to relieve the present hous-
ing situation sooner than was originally
expected. according to a plan recently
suggested to the News by several stu-
dents.

The plan offered is similar to that
which was adopted at Cornell university;
namely. the erection of a number of
Itttiltlittg‘ '1. each of which would
house [00 1., ICach tttlll would he
built separate as the Itt'l‘t‘S"t’_\ funds
are acquired. and would contain stillicicnt
comfort to al'l'ord the students all adc-
nuatc Iioiiie iii every respect. The orie-
iiial plan was to wait until sullicicnt luiids
were obtained for the purpt ‘e of build-
ing a somewhat luxurious residence hall.
large enough to house Still :«ltttlcttts. All
modern conveniences would he eiiiliodied

a swimming
pool. and other equipment. Student
opinion shows equal IllHlt‘ lor IiotIi
plans.

.\uiic Stafford, '30, «its. “I think it
would lie 'tttlvlsillllt' to litiild a central
Iiuilding to which units may he added
later on. "it-re art- :iltt';t)s a certain
iititiihcr of students who Itl't' iol‘t‘ctl to

ditioiis. Lack of .l i'i-sidcnci' |i III has kept
students from t'tttlttllj: io Stati- t'ollcec

I\'ttlIl ti. Moore, 'Jts'. remarks: "The

the pri'wiit Iioiisiiie tlitlicultu.»
long as the Iitiildiiies would he : '
in the end. I think the lil'lilttisllltill is ad
visahh', I am in lator of it."

“The student. are |tII\\' fairly well

“and I think it would he much hettcr

Beatrice Wright. '28. expresses her I
opinion: “The housing situation is ([tltlt‘
serious at State College. As far as those
girls who live iii any group houses are
concerned. such as Newman Ilzill, l‘ae'c
