mittee appointed by Ruth Latte, president of the student
association, and made up of itttertsted students. will make
a thorough study of tltc situation at State College. will
work ttpott its constitution attd later submit a plan to the
association for discussion and approval. Rest-arch work
will be done to determine t'tnltlitinns itt ntlter successful
schools. and the methods used there will. if possible, be
worked over atttl applied to our situation here.

It is only natural that this topic of disct . on should be.
by tltis time. a triﬂe irksonw. ltt fact. it seems rather
impractical for such scattered attd dwindling discussions, as

Francis Joseph i perhaps the most outstanding figure
in littropeatt Itionarchical history of the ninetc nth cen-
tttry. Hc d front the tittte of Metternich to the
World Wat. .tnd all these 5 ' 's his main object was to
oppose innovation altd to tttaitttaitt Mcttcrnich's status
qun.

The story of Francis Josrph is the story of littt'opc;
be wa' the last of the Holy Roman l‘:lll|)t'l'tt for siny -
eight years he held itt check the rising nationalism of an
‘ ' ortcd group of peoples. .\s Mr. ltaggcr puts it,
. life lay like a bridge across the tltllt‘lt't'tlllt century.
connecting the eighteenth with the twentieth; for in the
year of his bittlt the white litblll'lﬂttl banner still \\avctl
iii lirancc. and he died a few months before the llol-
shcvik revolution". Srarcrly any career ever licttct' de-
tttoustt‘ated the continuity of history.

This might be termed another of the "human being"
biographies so popular this season. It differs from some
of the others, itt that the atttltor ltas not gone :trltllltlitlg for
tilth aIId shady incidents with which to crattt the pages.
One gets itiatty side-lights to Francis ,loscph's idiosyti<
rracit-s: he would not use a telephone, or pct'ntii Itilt‘ itt
his wing of his palacc‘. yet te scttt rctttns oI telegrams
to offices across the street; he rode in an automobile
only once, that as a spuial favor to a visiting monarch;

Ilt' spent hours designing lllllftll‘llt‘ for his attd forcign

loaders: he refused to consider \\lIal llt' thought tin

Mr. llaggcr \vritcs fillt fully, attd has an usually latge

of dynastic troubles become lift sntnc. btit they are vasily
skipped over. \\'ith Mr. l.ti:|\\tg\ li'itottttl', t/tw Story
