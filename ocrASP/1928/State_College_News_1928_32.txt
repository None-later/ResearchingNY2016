STATE VARSITY FIVE

FACES PROVIDENGE

Following 3 Victories, State

Will Play Rhoda Island
Team Hera Tonight

liy ROY V. SULLIVAN

Having disposed of three weak learns
in the last three weeks, the Purple and
Gold ﬁve faces its third and last test of
the season. Providence college, of Provi-
dence, R. 1., is scheduled to take tbe_lloor
tonight against the State College live in
what. will probably prove to be one if
the best played and most interesting
games of the Albany court this season.
Providence comes to Albany with a
fairly good record, having disposed of
some of the stronger eastern college
teams. The Rhode Island outﬁt dropped
an early season game to Dartmouth col-
lege live by a somewhat greater margin
than the 43-23 defeat suffered by State
at the bands of the Green team. This
game was played on the Hanover Court.
however, giving Dartmouth an advan-
tagc.
The Purple and Gold will be strength—
ened by the rettirn of Captain Kiiczynski
to the line-tip. In the game last week
Tony was cutting fast and playing better
ball than he has played for a long time.
I'lcrney will he one of the guards and
lirilTin may start at the other guard post.
it is doubtful, however, that (iritiin will
play the whole game since his knee gives
him quite some trouble. tfarr will play
with t'aptain Kuzeynski up ahead and
(ian will probably get the call at the
pivot position.
'l‘wo Albany area basketball players
are listed in the lineup of lllt‘ l’rovi-
ilcnce college quintet for tonight. llcc-
tor Allen of 'l'roy aiul Charles Murphy
of Albany will be tivo of the forwards
who will come to 1\lhany tonight to op-
pose the I'urplc and tiold oiitlit. This is
the first tinn- in several seasons that two
local players have been on one of State's
oppositig teams.
Both Murphy and Allen have basket-
ball records in the Albany art-a which
they are expected to hold up tonight
against (Captain Kuczynski and t'ai'r.
