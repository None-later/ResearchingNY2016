in the past decade or so, it appears that
women are not - wholly reconciled to
normal feet," an article in last

“In llll‘ division of home economics at
Iowa State college." the article continues.
"a survey made under the direction of
t'roirssor Katherine t‘ranor oi 3” high
school girls" feet and shoes showed that
Jon \rorc shoes both too short and too
narrow. Only .28 \\'tlt‘t‘ correct length

America Discovered for $7200

Old records show that the cost of Columbus’ ﬁrst
expedition to America amounted, in modern exchange,

to only $7200. To ﬁnance Columbus,

Isabella,

Queen of Spain, offered to pawn her jewels. Today
word comes from Spain indicating that a twentieth
century importation from the new world is fast effect-
ing a sufﬁcient saving to ransom many royal jewels.
The Spanish Northern Railway reports that the
American equipment with which in 1924 the railroad
electriﬁed a mountainous section ofits lines from Ujo
to Pajareshns accomplished the following economies:

The substations, overhead
equipment for the complete
installation, and six of the
twelve locomotives for this
particularly diflicult‘ and
successful electriﬁcation
were furni hell by the GUI]-
and Electric Company. Gui-
crul Electric quality has
attained nnivrt'sal recog-
nition; the world over, you
will ﬁnd the (3-12 niunournm
an apparatus that is giving
outstanding service.

 

1. A SSC'I. saving in the Cunt ct' power.
'2. A reduction cf 40,; Li the number of engine miles for

the some traffic l:;‘,i:t'lL:l.

3. A saving of 7311C. in the cost of repairs and upkeep

for locomotives.

4. A saving of 63' f in CZ‘LV/ expenses.

5. A reduction of 31‘];

in the cost of moving a ton-

In every part of the world, electricity has replaced
less efﬁcient method: and is saving sums far
greater than the ransom of a queen's jewels. You
will always ﬁnd it an important advantage in your

work and in your home.
