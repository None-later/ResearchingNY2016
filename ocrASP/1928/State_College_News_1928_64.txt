STATE COLLEGE NEWS, APRIL 20, 1928 ‘

50 STUDENTS STUDY
SERMON 0N MOUNT
AT LISLE CONVENTIONf

By Emzaum‘u PULVER, '2‘)

About ﬁfty students representing Y.
W. C. A. and Y. M. C. A. organizations
of the various colleges of New York
State met at Lisle. N. Y., for the state
conference. A study of the Sermon on
the Mount was pursued as a means to
come to a better understanding of Jesus]
The approach was made from a histor-i
icttl viewpoint ﬁrst considering the polit-[
ical, economic and social conditions oi‘
that time.

Harry Bone, a student at Union
Theological Seminary, led the discussions
itt the big meetings, that is those in
which all delegates met. There were
also the. small meetings for which the
members were divided into four small
discussion groups with two leaders for
each group. Arthur Moore, traveling
Y. M. t". A. secretary. lx'atheriut p sh—
worth, traveling Y. \\', (7'. A. secretary.
lletly l\'a_\' Taylor, student at Union
'l‘heologie.’ Seminary. and Frank ()lnt-
dead. training Y. M. C. A. secretary.
were among those who headed the
unaller discussion groups.

Where as iii the general meetings only
the Sermon on the Mount was litlt't'll up,
in the individual groups variotn proli»
letus were considered. Among these
were, what factors should inﬂuence our,
in choosing a vocation, and local rampttsl
problems of various CldlL‘g‘fa.

Ruth Watts. '3‘), says of the conier»
once. “I think l was most impressed. at,
the l.i»le Conference, by the ])L'l'~()llitllllt‘st
oi the groups there, and especially tltmt-
oi the leaders. ltt that respect. abotc‘
all. it nus a “Mini interesting experience."

\\'ltile Mildred I.:tll' t '. '2‘), makes lllt‘
iollowing sttnuttary "I place among the.
most valuable contributions of the conr‘
it-rt'nce the contacts with the personal
itte». oi the leaders. and the L‘XIIL'I‘ICIH‘LN
shared with them in the small discussion
group“. It is lhru such i'ontaets as thesi-
that we come to realize stunt-thing of the
actual possibilities tut-day for t'lirist-
directed lives.” I

llerntan Kocrttcr, who represented tltel
Slate t'ollege V. .\l. t'. /\.. sums up hisl
impression: "The purpose oi this con-1
ict‘t-nct- was for me ittllilled as I gained:
a lllllL'Il clearer and more complete tmtlt'r- '
standing oi lcsu», l'lte Cultit'l‘cltt‘e was
enjoyable and helped in another aspect.}
that of the Contact with the capahlc
leadtrs and sincere delegates who at 
lendctl."
