I
Bridge, Dancing And Lecture Notes
Engage. Diphtheria-Exposed Delta:

Delta Omega is not receiving
this week-end except envious
glances of the other undergrad-
uates. With ﬁnal examinations but
a week awaypth'e entire rolloi resi-
dents in the sorority's house, 55
South Lake avenue, is cutting
classes right and left.

With the approval. and at the
urgent orders 0 the .board of
health. the members are staying
home this week. Holly Sautter.
'28‘ is the innocent cause of the
trouble. Holly was so inconsider-
ate as to expose the Deltas to
(liptherla.

By way of diversion, the girls are
studyingr notes lor linal cxzuuina~
tions. dancing and conducting a
marathon bridge tournament.

Blood tests were taken this week.
and if they show no positive re~
actions, the girls will be released
next week.
