NAME DEAN METZLER
COMMITTEE CHAIRMAN

Dean William H. Metzler has been
appointed chairman of a local coni-
mittee at State College for the pro-
motion of national education associa-
tion relations.

“Similar committees have been com-
posed at various colleges and univer-
sities throughout the country," says
Dean Ietzler, "and the purpose of
these committees is to keep the re-
mote sections of the country as well
informed on educational projects as
other sections.” Dean Metzler will co,
operate with the college faculty for
promoting educational welfare and will
communicate with the headquarters of
the organization at Washington, D.

The committee will also receive
information as to the. policies and
activities of the other committees
throughout the country.

The secretary of the association at
Washington, J. W. Crabtree, com»
mended the appointment of Dean
Metzier, characterizing him as a con—
structive thinker and leader and as
being of especially hiin rank in the
profession. He explained the general
purpose of the organization in the fol«
lowing statement:

“While college professors have been
devoted and loyal to their technical
groups, as a rule, they have not been
interested in problems relating to the
general welfare of the profession. A
united front on any problem, proposal
or demand has never been presented.
This is the chief reason why colleges
have been so slow in readjusting
salaries to meet increased Costs andi
new conditions.

“College instructors receive the lowv
est pay of any profession in propor-
tion to the type of service rendered.
The association urges better salaries
for instructors and professors and bet-
ter instruction in the freshman and
sophomore years."

State college will he benefited in
that it will he more closely related
with other colleges and univcr. ic.
throughout the country, Dean Mctzlcr
said.

CO-EDS FAVOR CUTS

TO PRESENT SYSTEM
AT STATE COLLEGE

Cuts or no cuts, that is the question.’
Most colleges have a system of cuts
whereby a student may legally be absent
from a certain number of Classes a
semester. State does not use :1 cut
system, but many students would Iikc‘
State to adopt the system.

“Most colleges have a system of cuts,"
Caroline Schleich, '29, says. "i'd like it."

Dorothy lx'abic, '28, believes that “a
etit system would be better, for i think
students just take them anyway." Rich-I
ard Jensen, ’28, favors a rut system if
intelligently used. lie says “a system of,
cuts would c‘imiiizite a great deal ofi
false ‘cxcnses' and give the student :ii
chance to have an occasional day 0 loi
catch up on back work. The trouble is,,
students will not iiw this privilege in»
telligcntly and very often it becomes
'auuthcr day wasted :uvay.‘ " ‘

DR. BRUBACIIER FOR
STUDENT FRANKNESS
IN MORAL QUESTIONS

“The popular view of God becomes
liberal as society progresses," Dr. A.
R. Brtibachcr, president State College
told the student Y. M. C. A. recently.

The brotherly teachings of Christ
be characterized as higher in the scale
of an evolved society than the Mosaic
code.

“The finest thing in modern student
life is its frankness. It gives students
an opportunity to bring I't‘llgiirll)
moral and social questions up for dis
mission and answer,"

“Within each of us there is a desire
to get to something higher. It is that
something within us that is related in .1
God. We can not burrow religions
conceptions, but must form our own,"
he declared. “The theory of race iin
mortality shows the belief in 5min»
thing ﬁne that persists in our civili-
zatiou."

“We should set up in the minds of
