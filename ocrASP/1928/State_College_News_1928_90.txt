Cums To Read Glass Hlstory;
Edna Wolte To Tell
Class Prophecy

 

Class day ceremonies will begin June
15 at 8 o'clock in the evening in the au—
ditorium. Gilbert Ganong, senior Class
president, will preside over the cere-
monies. Chrissie Curtis, ’28, the class
councillor, will speak in that capacity,
and also as the class historian. The

» class prophecy will be given by Edna

Wolfe, ’28, and the class poem by Doro-
thy Watts, ’28.

The class tcstator, Mary Judith Lang-
don, ’28, will read the class will. The
ceremony will be followed by the torch
light procession thru the front door of
Draper hall to \‘Vestem m'L‘IlllL‘. Seniors
are requested to sign tip next week on
the main bulletin board [or torches, (ia-
nong said today. They will cost ap—
proximately fifteen cents, he said.

Chrissie Curtis, '28, ha. been elected
alumni councillor for the graduating
class. This position places Miss Cur-
tis on the graduate council which was
organized in 1919 for the purpose of
maintaining relationship with alumni ut
the College. The council consists ()l
one member of each class from 1848
to the present date. The duties oi
each member of the council is to write
at least one letter each year to all
members of his class, incorporating all
activities, appeals, friendly greetings to
classmates, and all else of general in,
tercst to the members. The councillors
stir tip interest in the alumni associa-
tion and their projects. and stimulate
eo-operation among their classmates.
They also keep the address list of
their class and keep the files correct.
0n alumni day they bring in l‘t"0l‘l.S
and general information.

In recent years the classes have set
aside a sum of money, the inronie (ll
which helps to pay the expenses oi
the annual letter. Some of the coun-
Cillors have divided the class into units
of ten with an appointed peisuii to
write personal letters to each of the
ten in his unit. This dispenses with
the Cold form of mimeographed letter.

On Alumni Day, Saturday, June (J,
Miss Curtis will meet with the other
councillors in the morning, he intro-

council dinner at night. She will there
become a full-fledged practical roun-

council. Hilda Sarr, '27, is the alumni
councillor of last year‘s senior cl' "

Coach Grunt For Wind Trying
To Reach “Do” On Saxophone

 

 

Do~ra~me~fasso-la—ti- “Psliawl I have- as
not enough wind to reach do". And in
Coach Rutherford Baker lays his saxo-
phone on the table as ﬁve men, crowding
the coach's ollicc, look at each other with
disappointment.

The Coach has been busy practising
on the saxophone lor the past month.
“I'm just taking lessons to pass away
the time", he admitted.

He refused to tell the name of his
favorite tune. It's “Turkey in the
Straw" is the opinion of Louis M. Klein,
'29. “I‘ve heard it; but I don't know
what it is", said Harry C. McMahon,
'31, and his statement seems to represent
the general opinion in the locker room.

The latest number in the coach’s rc-
pertoire is “Together”.
