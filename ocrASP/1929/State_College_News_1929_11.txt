2 Cracker: Are Elioult A Day;
For Each Extra Om You’ll Pay

Crackers are for use with soup,
and if cafeteria customers take
more than two, an additional charge
will be made.

That is one of ﬁve rules drawn
up by Miss Laura F. Thompson,
manager. The others are:

I. “Do not study ill the cafeteria
from II to 2 o'clock. This will
give people coming in for luncheon
a place to sit, and will give the stall
an opportunity to clean up iii the
afternoon.

2. “When giving
clearly and audibly.

3. “Do not come under the. rail
for food, but stand in line and wait
your turn.

. "Do not carry iiiilstard o'
ketchup away from the counter."

it the students aiid faculty will
observe the rules, it will mean a
great imprlwenient in the service,
according to Miss 'l‘lionipson.
