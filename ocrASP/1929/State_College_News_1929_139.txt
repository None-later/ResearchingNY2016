OUR GENTLEMAN BURGLAR

Six people attended the first vespers services, offered two weeks

We Gen, and do, bleno the geeple who so far took cdventcge of the
kindness and generosity of the State College student association cs to
steel the records louned the sun or session so as to urge noon hour

for the d.ring theft of six sgeend nﬁnd records. There couldn't be HOIK
than one person so petty in college.Luetily, the thief(or should we 3}
sne:n?)preved gunerous and left five of the poorer reeo;ds. If Le
should cone to the SUKTERTIHES efiiee, We should be glfd 3f the Opf-
ortunity to thank him p-rsontlly for his kindness.
