IS THE WATER TURNED ON YET?

Water, water everywhere, prohibition agents,
But not a drop to drink; ’ Watching from on high,
Water in the streams and'lakes, Gaily smile and laugh aloud
But nothing in the sink. As Albany goes dry.
Water, water everywhere, ' ’ Dishes all are greasy,
But none for dirty faces, ‘ Can't get off the goo;
Unless it comes from wells or pumps, Pots and pans and silver
Or other distant places. All are greesy too.
Wash your face in Vichy, Sincc the main was busted,
Never mind the soap, Since the pipe was spoiled,
Lots of powder so the folks On figures and math tables
Won't notice it, you hope, The men have toiled and toil
Ginger ale's for shaving, ' Fixing of the Conduit
Gin slicks down your hair, All depends on moth.
Sunback dresses disappear. (WiSh thOSC guys WOUld lOSTH
(Should dirty backs go bare?) ‘ t0 “dd,

so I could taco : bath.)
Dirty faces 'round me,
Dirty necks, the some;
Dirty hands and dishes,
Ain't it a dirty shame?
