REGENTS BOARD WILL RAISE TELCHING STANDARDS

Steps toward the raising of the standards of teaching of special
subjects in the secondary schools of the state were taken recently by
the board of regents of tho University of the State of New York when
it ruled that, beginning in September, 1935, candidates for such posité
ions must show credentials showing the completion of four years train-
ing in the Subject. Eighteen hours of professional courses will also
be required.

Among the special courses named in the ruling of'the board of regent:
are physical education, home economics,'and drawing. A bachellor's de-
gree or its equivalent will be demanded.

To comply with the ruling, the Cortland Normal School will change
its three year course in physical education to a four year course.
Among the other schools affected by this ruling is the Plattsburgh
Normal School, which at present gives a three year course in commerce.
