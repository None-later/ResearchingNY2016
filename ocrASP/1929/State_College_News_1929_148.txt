Dr. Earl B.South, professor of education, and Mrs.South, will leave
for Yale University September 2, where Dr. South will attend the Inter-
ngtienel Psychological Congress, of which he is a member. This is the

From e tiny, derk niche in the college wells and e meagre shelf of
text books to the lerge,eiry, well lighted Co—op of next year....thet
is, in outline, the history of the rise and growth of the College
Co-operetive Book Shop in its outward nspects. To anyone interested in
seeing below end beyond the surface of things, however, there is anoth-
er story of an inner, more subtle, and much more significant rowth
then that of more space; and that concerns a growth in unders ending
service to the students and faculty of State College.

The Co—op seeks to fulfill your every need thoughtfully end effic-
iently; you have but to make it known. To those among you who still
think of the Co—op as a plrco interested only in text bosks and the
other appurtenances of study - necessary, to be sure, and the true refs
on for its existence - the invitation is always open to visit the Co-op
uni browse around. The gift book department of modern literature and
beautiful editions of the classics will discover to you row upon row of
CHChLEthDt. And there are other surprises in the nrny delightful thing
that the still tiny, but still growing, Co-op can somehow contrive to
hold. Cone in.....end browse around!
