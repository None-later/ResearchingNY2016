NOT EVERYTHING THnT'S NEW IS PROGRESS;
PROPER CHOICE TESTS EDUCATION; SAYS E.L.

There is one who stands squarely in the way of progress; wearing
the thick coat of doubt and fear; while around him is the spring of new
thought and new life; refusing to feel the warmth and meaning outside
because; forsooth; to change will mean buying a new coat. That can be
put off until the permanence of change from winter to spring is fully
established. ' ( V ‘ »

we are prone to forget in our day that we are still in the spring:
time of human progress. We are still awaking; growingi st:etching up-
ward. we compare our own time with the past and say; 'How we have pro-
gressed: How much better our social customs; our religious beliefs; our
economic situation; our moral codes: Surely; since they are the best
so far; they must be perfect; or at least as nearly perfect as is hu;
manly possible." It is as much as saying times have changed in the paid;
but they will not change in the future. Laws that have applied in the
past apply no more. Shall our laws govern all future ages? We have set
aside the divine right of kings; a custom that seemed absolutely un—
shakable in the middle ages. What about the divine right of money? Be-
lieve it or not; it is a thing in which most Americans believe.

There is something heroic and daring in changing one's mind; in re.
placing a musty; time worn idea for a new one. Do not love the new be;
cause it is new; but do not love the old because it is easy and famil;
iar. When you can choose between that which is merely new and that
which is progress; you are truly educated. E.L.
