In the present light of medical science, women
are risking a normal development when they engage
in sports which sap up the vitality and injure a
delicate nervous system. Doctors‘ reports, read re—
cently at the athletic conference for American col-
lege women, were almost unanimous in their (lis—
approval of contests which involve keen competition.
Play (lay, inaugurated by the athletic association,
shows the way to a sancr program for women.

The new policy has particular significance for stu-
dents entering the teaching field. It points to the
danger in heated competition. Now and then, physi-
cal directors in the high schools clamor for girls'
inter-school sports which usually wear heavily on
the body through the restless anxiety and bitter
rivalry excited. Teachers can help the natural dc-
vclopmcut of their students by checking all attempts
of physical directors to line them up on the inter-
school field. They should squelch all instructors in
physical cdttcatiou who measure progress, not by the
health of their students, but by the number of ric—
tories they hang at thcir belts.
