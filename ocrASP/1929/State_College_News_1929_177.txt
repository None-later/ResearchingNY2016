A: Doctor Order: Quarantine

The thirst for knowledge con-
quered the men at College House
Wednesday, when they eluded a
quarantine sign placed upon the
house. A scigc of tousilitis and
throat lt‘otlblc hit the house, cou-
fining‘ Walter Driscol, '30, I'-
mondc (i. (iuyer and Anthony
I\',ulczylti, freshmen. to bed. |)r
liarl J. Ilnrwaldt, assistant instru-
tor in hygiene, placed the house
under quarantine. ordering every
l't‘S.(IClll not to attend cl' us or
to enter the College building's until
Monday.

Anxiety about the loss of college
work was so pressing that the men
urged Dr. Dorwaldt to omit them
from the quarantine. So, now the
three ailing members of the House
are isolated in rooms by themselvcs
and the others are cheerfully ut-
tending lectures and struggling
with quizzes.
