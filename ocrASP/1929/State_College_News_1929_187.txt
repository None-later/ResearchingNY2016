were never ends in lllL‘lllNJllL‘i, but rather the tools for
living a richer life. From them, he lricd to extract
everything which would lead ~lutlcnts “ad licnc \'ivcu-
(lum.” Catholic in his taste, he revealed to them the
treasure of noble thoughts in every language, He was
never narrow in his outlook, or rooted in proi'iucialism.
but he poss sed that wide range of interests which un-
doubtedly is the mark of the cultured man. Seeker of
truth and lover of beauty. he was always an inspiration
to those who were trying to learn how to ll\'L‘. But
“God’s linger touched him, and he slept." the words of
one oi his favorite poets, describe his passing away.

V The influence of Dr. Richardson on all those who
have studied under him and on all those who knew him
has left an indelible mark in their memories. lluniblc,
considerate men are rarely forgotten. ISiate college can

In a few years, the name of Richards hall will have had
no signiﬁcance for students here. A change to Richard-
3011 ball will perpetuate the name of a man who might
truly be said to have realized the college motto. The
'name of Richardson above the portals will sugged that
humbleucss and that sincerity which are usually the
marks of a great teacher.

The building, hearing his name, will remind ~tudt-nts
that they are entering Richardson hall, and not a mere
building. The association of ills name will lllt'ltll cu-
couragcmcnt to those who carucslly sci-k truth and
llCﬂl‘l)’. and it will éll\\'i|_\'~i he an inspiration for those
who are trying to achieve the college motto. Lite is
usually cunoblcd when students can work under the
lanting tradition of a high-minded professor. lili-llitllh
ing Richards ball will l)t.' a monmncnt to the pure ideals
of a great teacher.

menting upon the weather. it is said that they turn to
their laét resort in pointing out that the meteorologist
is the greatest liar the world has ever known. The
lounge supplies, more than any course in the curriculum.
the opportunity to develop the art of conversation, but
it can never be tried if students insist upon studying.
The hookworius ought to give the students a chance.

THE BROOM BELONUS TO THEM

The administration building is beginning to look like
a countryside dotted with bill board Signs. There was
a time when students used to post notices; now they
jumble them. Students used to be able to read <igns‘ on
the bulletin boards; now they have to tttrn through two
notices successfully stuck on one thumhtack. which is
usually appropriated from another notice.

The bulletin board is a patchword of notices. almost
impossible for students to understand. 1 wa~~ with
some difﬁculty that a junior convinced his classmate
that thc iuv' ion to refreshments had not been made
by the registrar. but was part of a club notice which
had been pinned on the registrar's announcement. An—
other freshman, Citllillscd by the licltcr-skelter arrange—
ment of the uoticca, attended a meeting of a bible cla~s
before he realized that he was not at the liiology chili
picnic. .‘\illl another ll't‘~lll]lilll. thinkingI that he had

It \\as' 1hr lirsi time we have had
an opportunity to see Miss ‘3 lii'sta
cxhiliil her talent: on the college
age. She carried hcr character of
a cultured Chorus girl with a show
of real ability. We almost dropped
a ll'lll' when xhc ﬁnally gave tip the
“Ellt‘t'dltl” for his own good. money,
position. and all that.

As to the child; lidwiii Otis, im<
ported from Milne High school, did
an excellent piece of work, He did
not art as children usually do. but
scented to he dclinitely ill the part.
We liked Mi 5 Hilton a< tlic staid.
moneyed aritocrat with the gilt of
understanding.

"to rest ol the characters, lrving
Mct‘omicll. -th Jackson. lx‘uth
