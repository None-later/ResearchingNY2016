iiig an antiquated policy which scents to have nothing
but the practice oi ycars to justify it.

According to present conditions. students are really
paying for seats in order to .tand up. If students must
sit upon hard pillars. the council might provide Cll‘lllllllx.
It seems rather dangerous to have students perched upon
the balcony. l’nor Mr. tiraingcr was continuth look-
ing up abovc him, apparently afraid that some student
might fall down into his lap and interrupt the concert.
The dangers in straddling pillars at a concert are
greater than those of strap-hanging iii a subway train.
It only seems fair to ask that music council jniik the

old policy which has been in effect tor years.

Another invasion of rats may sweep down npoii the
college if present conditions pc 't. Students are fail-
ing to observe administration regulations in the eating
of lunches, The cafeteria and the annex have been rc-
scrvcd for eating purposes, but the corridors and Cllhs‘
rooms seem to he more attractive. It also seems more
convenient to throw cracker cartons and unfinishcd
sandwiches on the floor than to dispose of them in illl'
cafeteria and in the annex.

Rats will congregate in places where food has not
been removed. When students eat in the rooms ri-serxed
for them. the cafeteria management can get rid of all
food which might be very attractive for the rats. Font
left in other parts of the building, provide bait for the
rats. livery time that an apple core or a pickle sand-
wich is thrown into the waste papcr baskets, some poor
animal is being deprived of its dinner,

It would ht: very unfortunate if the rats should l‘ctlll‘ll
to Collette for another visit upon the invitation of slur
dents. The instructor \lltllllll not he expected to spend
the class hour in chasing :i rat out of the room, and it
is doubtful if there are enough men to assist the women
who faiiit when one of the dusky rodents starts to frislt
about.

When a Milne High school student was receiil';' told
that he should not throw candy wrappers mi the ﬂoors
of the corridors, his iiniiicdiatc rt'spolisc was, “Wt-l,
the State college students do it." It is difficult for thc
practice teachers to enforce cleanliness if the college
students do not lead the way. If the tootsie rolls and
the bean sandwiches are eaten in the cafeteria or iii
the aiiiicx, the Milne students will follow sllll.

STATE COLLEGE NEws, NOVEMBER 1, 1929'
America Faces Crisis. Dr Painter Thinks;

. 'i '
FRONT ROW AGAIN;

State college isv‘iii th front_row oncé moral Drt
Hnrncr, execjitivc secretary of die State Teaclicrsl
association... and former (lean 'at State college. told the
men at the Kappzl" Phi Kappa dinner Tuesday that the
choice of prospective teachers in the state will be put
upon a more scientiﬁc basis. In the future. scholarship
will not be the only standard for admission.

State college has recognizer! that the teacher cannot
be judged by his strings of A's or E's. Personality is
too large a factor to be neglected. Accordingly, those
entering students who have low scholarship ratings are
tested from another angle. Have they the personality
traits of a successful teacher? The question is answcrcd
by examinations which seek to discover those char-
actcristicts.

State college has seen that the teacher cannot be
judgcd by marks alone, and it has devised means of
ﬁnding those other car marks for successful teaching.
it is leading the way in the movement which will try
to place the selection of teachers in .\'L'\\' York state on
:i more scicntif'ic basis.

Dr. George A.  Painter, head

“It has become axiomatic that na-

“Today. America stands the richest,

“Will America be able to stand this
