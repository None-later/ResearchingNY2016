GRAFT RUMOR IS
FALSE, RICE SAYS

President Denies Charge That
Sophomores Mishandled
Funds 0' Giant

“The ruutor to the effect that mem-
bers of the sophomore cla‘s have
misappropriated class funds is abso»
lutely without any foundation what—
soever. George P. Rice, president of
the c ass. declared today.

“During this week the rumor li"
lieen circulating aroniid the locker
rooms and corridors. If the actual
circumstances surrounding the appro—
val of the appropriation were known,
everyone could easily see how gronud~
less tlte rumor is." Rice said.

The rumor begati when an apprn>
priation of Slit was recently granted
for the expei of the sophomore
football team. At the time. no speci-
fic manner of spending the money
was outlined. Members of the class
spent the money for shoulder pads
and other football equipment. accord-
ing to Kenneth E. J\'l cr ophomore
manager of men’s athletic

Coach Batter Loaned Bali

Coach Rutherford R. Baker loaned
a ball to the men of both the fresh-
man and sophomore Classes for their
football game. During one of the
practice ions. the ball was hunted
up into a tree and lost, :\r|ton llush,
Freshman manager of men's athletics.
purchased a new football, costing Sill.
.-\ftcr the game. this new ball was
given to (foaeh ilaker to replace the
one which the men had lost,

The question at issue at the present
time is whether the classes shall aps
propriale the money or whether the
men of the two clas. s shall individ-
ually cotttribute to reimburse llush
for the purchase of the new football.

“Myskania has no knowledge of

 

 

 

 

-.r

   
 

 

 

any such misappropriation and so far
as it hows, the rumor is wtthom
foundation," said Anna '1. Moore,

'30, a member of Myskania.

Engineer Will Survey Site
This Week To Discover
Need At Creating

Efforts of the student council to

provide for better trafﬁc facilities in
front of Draper hall on Western
avenue, culminated in the promise
of Frank Lasch, commissioner of
public. safety, to send an engineer
to the site in order to determine
whether or not additional facilities
we needed.
‘ nes J. Kirwin, taut cout-
nns oner of public safety, will visit
the spot before the end of this
week, and will report to Commis-
sioner Laseh.

if his survey warrants the intro-
duction of new equipment, it will
be installed early next year. accord-
ing to Commissioner Lasch. Noth-
ing can he done, this year, he said,
because no provision has been
made in this year's budget for the
erection of additional trafﬁc sig-
nals. The money for new trafﬁc
equipment will be included in the
new budget to be presenter] at the
close oftbis year, according to the
connnisstouer.

Previous Attempt Made

it' Mr. Kit-win finds that signals

are unnecessary, no action will be

    

   

 

taken, Mr. Lasch announced.

" '~ int attempt to obtain
crossing signals is not the ﬁrst to
be made. l.a‘t year, Professor
Winfred (H Decker, head of the
(iernian department. made an un‘
successful attempt for trailic equip-
ment,

The need of trath facilities at
the site w shown by the acci-

     

dents \\‘llitl caused the death of
two people within a short period of
time.

The results of Mr. Kirwiu's re—
port will be printed in the next is-
sue of the News. A report on the
subject will also be given to the
student association this morning,
according to Marion li. llotto, '30,
]il’t‘~l(lt'i|l of the student association.

Mice Are-Fed To Find
What Boys Should Eat

Nutrition experiments with whitt-
rats are being conducted by the . r—
t'lllli grade boys of the junior depart-
mom of .\lihtc lliglt school under the
supervision of the home economics
department. The purpose of these ex-
periments, according to Beatrice 0.
Uaughan, '30, who is in charge, is to
enable the boys to find out the best
possible diet for a growing boy or
gir .

In discussion periods, the boys dis~
Ct>\'c"ll many facts about thrir diet
which are being used in the experiv
ment. liive rats are used. two for
:i control, one is fed a diet deﬁcient
in milk. another a meatless diet, and
the fifth rat getting unthng hut car-
hohydrate foods.

The experiments are being conduc-
ted for a period of three weeks.
"Differences in weight, in appetite,
and slight changes in appearance are
external." Miss (iattghaii said. The
are kept in room l of Richards
itall, and everyone is welcome to in-
spect them and the daily records
which the boys are keeping,”
