ART DEPARTMENT
EXHIBITS FLEMISH
PAINTINGS HERE

The State college art department
is showing an exhibit of Flemish
paintings during this week and next,

according to Miss Eunice A. Perine, .33

instructor in ﬁne arts. This exhibit
is presented to draw the attention
of students to the gallery of Flemish
paintings now being shown in New
York city, Miss Perine said. The pro-
ceeds of this showing at the Klein-
bergcr gallery in New York will be
devoted to buying milk for poor chil-
dren in the city, Miss Perine an-
nounced.

"It is possible that students may
go to New York city over the holi-
day, and it will be a line opportunity
for them to see portraits gathered
from the homes of millionaires for
this particular purpose," Miss Perine
declared.

The present showing of paintings
is the ﬁrst of a series which will be
exhibited by the college art depart-
ment, according to Miss Perine. All
exhibitions will be on the second ﬂoor
of Draper hall, either in the art
studio or in the hall adjoining, Miss
Perine said.
