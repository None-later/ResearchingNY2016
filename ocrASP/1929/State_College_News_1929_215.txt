NEWS SYMPOSIUM
' INDICATES DESIRE
TO ALTER RULES

Continued trntn [men 1, column 5
mon sense," she said.

Phyllis Uline, '30, president of
Epsilon Beta Phi sorority, says,
“I do not think the rules are too
strict. The women have, through
their house representative, a say in
making the rules; so they ought
not to kick.”

Eleanor Venable, ’32, president
of Mrs. Lilly's group house, 425
Hudson avenue, would say nothing
concerning house rules.

Fanny M. Sipperley, '30, presi-
dent of the Young Women's
(Christian association house, said,
“these rules might .have been
popular in the mid-Victorian era,
lil't they are passe now. They
pace undue restrictions on the stu~
dents and seem to be more sltlt~
able for high school pttpils than for
young ladies in college]: I

“I feel that the present agitation
over liotise rules is unwarranted
I consider our house rules very
sensible, and hope they. may eon-
tiittie unchanged." said Sophia
Schneider, ‘30, president of Syd-
dunt hall. . v

“I aitt of tlte opittioti titat some
rules are necessary for.a good
standard of conduct, btit Since it 15
impossible to enforce all the pres-
ent rules, I believe that they shou' '
be. of a more general character,’
Margarita Galusha, '32, prestdent of
Mrs. Katherine Reynolds' house.
102 South Lake avenue. "For ex-
ample, too much red tape is re-
quired tor one to obtain permis-
function

   

sion to attend a social
outside of State college.”

“We have never had any trouble
with house rules,” according to
Betty White, '30, president of Mrs.
Cassidy's group house, 208 Sher-
man street. “We tell Mrs. Cassidy
when we go out, and we always
try to get in by eleven. We are
quite satisfied with the rules as
they now stand."

Marjorie Morton, ‘33, president
of Waterbury hall. says: '
present group house rules seem to
me to be necessary evi 5.”

“Since we have certain house
rules now, I think that they should
be obeyed." Constance Clayton, '30,
president of the house at 439
Washington avenue, thinks.

"However, I feel that some re-
visions are needed atitl perhaps a
better understanding of what tlw
l‘ttles really mean, Our rules are
more lenient than those in many
other colleges, bitt also, our rollt'ge
life and surroundings differ front
those in other colleges," said (on-
stance ('laytnn, '30, president of
the house at 42‘) \‘t'asltington ave-
