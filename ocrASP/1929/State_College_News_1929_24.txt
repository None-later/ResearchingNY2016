Buildings Not Made By Slapping Brichs Together;
[00 Drawings Required, Superintendent Declares

If anybody thinks that building a school is just a matter of putting ‘down one
brick, putting cement on top of it, and then laying down another brick, he is
respectfully referred to William Klettz, superintendent of construction, who
‘is state inspector of construction for the three new college buildings. He will
quickly dispell any such illusmn. . . '

There must be more than a hundred drawings, from the original plaiis drawn
by the state architects, tinder Colonel Acheson, state engineer, to the ﬁnal work-
ing plans used by each Carpenter, electrieiau. plumber oi'_ plasterer. When the
state drawings are made. the contractors must 'iiake detail drawings ii‘iilll‘llicl‘n
giving all specifications. These drawings lll't'nitii‘\\‘tif(lt'(l to the state architects
otlice, where they are checked and corrected. the work then goes forward irom
these drawings.

Art Work More Thorough
