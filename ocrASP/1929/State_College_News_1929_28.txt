PITTSBURGH TAKES
HONORS IN DEBATE

Commission Of Experts To Try
Cases ls Suggested By
Visiting Team

 

Declaring tltat the American jtlry
system is as antiquated in an age of
specialization as is the horse ‘and
buggy in a machine era, the Univer-
sity of Pittsburgh debaters won from
the men's varsity forensic squad \’VL‘tl~~
nesday night by a vote of Dean Harold
Alexander, of the Albany I.a\v School,
sole judge.

Roger Hamilton, the first allirtna-
tive speaker, pointed out that the ex-
isting defects in the system are in-
herent and that no modiﬁcation could
improve tlte system. He struck boldly
for an expert system. declaring that
the opinion of experts was far better
than that of a group of the average
laymen.

(ieorge 1'. Rice, ‘33, lirst negative
speaker, declared that tlte evils in the
system, arose from defective adminis-
tration ol the system and said that
lundamentally the system was practi-
Millic. l’le declared that the jury had
permanent qualities wliit'h could not
be duplicated in any substitute, puilllr
int,r ottt the democratic and represen—.
tative elements. l'le tlt‘t‘ltll'l‘tl the juries
were a good cross-sertion oi the (om.
nlnnity and that they could logically
evaluate testimony.

David Btiergt-r, second :tliit'tit:tti\'t‘
speaker, declared that the proposed
change was no radical do 'll'llll't.‘ from
tlte present system. "We do not
place our lives in the hands of amateur
physicians, so nliy should \\e have
amateur jurors lay down for us prin
cipals of law“? llt‘ asked.

"Certain modilit'ations. reducing t'ost,
delay, and rules oi L'\'lllt‘llt'(’ .tnd prnrl
cednre will eliminate present diI Vi,
ties” according to l'itnannt-l (ireen,i
'30, second negative nutter. tireeu.‘
suggested four tnodiliv tions which he
said were administrative, and \\‘ltit'ltt
would not change the Inmlatneutal
purpose oi the jury, l

t‘, john l‘ltillips, third l'ittsbtn’glt
speaker, declared that the jury cannot
st‘ltlt: eoulplit‘att-d laws and that the“
litigating parties were mort- and more
trequently resorting to arbitration.
'i'lle rive exprrts, he said. Would be
t'liosen by civil service emittinations.

' 'd that the present s_\ stem larkt-d
ency and that the jury did nott
represent a true rro geetion oi the‘
connnttnityt [it man_ instanres, hel
pointed out, the ain- was not to satisfyi
the law, but to win the t“ 1.

Louis J. \'\'olner, third
speaker. said that the tuo main iuuci
[ions of the jury were to evaluate tlit:
testimony and to determine the ttredi
blltty oI witnesses and gaw instantes

The student who changed aroun-
tet‘Ieit ten dollar gold piece in the co—
nperative book store last month has
communicated with the department of
justiee agent on the ease, aceording to
Miss l-leleu 'l‘. liar. manager.

The girl rt-t'eived the rttltlllt‘l‘lt'll
money as a birthday present from an
uncle, and it will be traced through
him, Her name is kept secret.

The secret service mail has taken no
action tltis week, in order to give the
girl time to explain where she re ' ed
the ialsc piece. according to Miss bay.

\\‘lteu .\liss l’ay took the
gold piece to the l’ark brant‘b of the
National t‘onnuereial Iauk and Trust

Examination: Aren’t What They
Formerly Were, "Clint-In" Says

“Examimitions aren't what they
used to be."

50 said Charles VVurthtnan, veteran
janitor, this week, recalling days when
the questions were written on the
blackboard the night before ﬁnal ex~
antiuations.

So s ' . (‘ltarles reminiscetl a bit
and related how he once was "in a
jam”. due to the old system. It seems
that some students conceived the
bright idea of creeping up to the
window at night and, by means of a
flashlight thrown on the board. eopy~
ing‘ the questions. The instructor was
subsequently stu'p ‘sed at ﬁnding thal
all the students passed the test, and
since the door to the room had been
lorked and the only other person to
have had a key was t‘harles, he was
inn-stintth about the matter, tnurh to
his surprise. Luckily for ltim, how-
eter. some student let the secret slip
out and the result was that Charles
was cleared from all suspicion of
dttplieity and the entire class took
another examination.
