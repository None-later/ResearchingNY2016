Boasting the best passing attack
that any State College basketball team
has shown lll several years, the present
ontlit is going to make it interesting
tor St. Bonaventure tomorrow, to say
the least. The Saints are about as
strong as they were last year when
they won a one point Victory over
the local melt.

Winning three straight games
this year so far, the State outﬁt has
scored 95 points to 43 for the op-
position. Better passing than ever
is the reason for the success of the
boys this year. However, there is
still room for quite a bit of im-
provement.

After the freshmen victory on
Saturday the prospects for a fair
varsity team for next year aren't I
as dark as they were before. The
