Teacher Should See Problems
From Student Viewpoint,
Dr. Morris Advises

“A teacher must have the desire and
ability to see another‘s point of view, to
think and feel in terms of the pupil’s
reaction as well as her own," Dr. Eliza-
beth H. Morris, assistant professor of
education, said recently.

“The characteristics which aid in the
cultivation of these qualities are an
understanding of pupils as human beings,
which psychology can contribute to a
great degree; of pupils as differing indi-
viduals; tltc kind of imagination that
ads insight, enables its to read meaning
into facts, and the kindly feeling that
Combines all this into a ‘liuiiian' point
of vietv. The teacher particularly needs
to be an allrotind person in her sym—
pathies, even though she may not show
prowess in many different lines.
general, she must have an understanding
of human nature.

Common Ground Needed

Dr. Morris illustrated her point by an
analogy of the teacher of Latin and the
st'luinlboy who went fishing, “.'\ teacher
of Latin who likes the Woods himself
can be sympathetic with the boy whose
thoughts “under to a trout stream in—
stead of ‘striyiiig iu the necessary lit"

common ground of liking trout streams
and bring his thoughts back from them
to Latin, instead oi just taking an atti—
tude of intolerance, that is. scolding the
boy for having his thoughts on trout
streams when they should be on Latin,"
Dr. Morris said.

Another important criterionoi J1 school
teacher's personality is the necessity to
remember that personalities are the
products of situations and change rou-
stautly under changing conditions. and
the teacher should realize some of her
own good points and shortcomings by
