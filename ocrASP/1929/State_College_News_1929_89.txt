less than the conventional Chorus
girl wears 0n the stage, when the
ireshinan and sophomore classes got

light. Alter live minutes of vigorous
pullingr and tearing. not a man was
left with a stitch of clothing,r above
the waist.

impartial judges were divided in
opinion as to where to place the vie-
tory. The freshmen took the sopho—
inores' shirts off before they lost all
of their own. but the sophoninrcs
divested the freshmen til 1‘) shirts to
the sophomores‘ 12. Decision of act-
nal supremacy may have to wait tintil
