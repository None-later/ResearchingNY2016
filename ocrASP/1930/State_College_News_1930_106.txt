Lack of a student association and
a student tax has crippled the social
calendar this year. There have been
years in the past during which

“Everything is a source of fun.
obody's safe for we care for none.
Life is joke that just begun."

Jane Ward's life experiences are
repeated in those of her children, a
bit too exactly to ring true but this
helps to bring home the point to the
reader that experience of one genera
tion are merely modiﬁed slightly and
repeated by the next. Once Jane in
looking iczii‘iully into the future
thought. "Sex was a loader pistol,—
placed in the hands of humanity. Her
mother's generation had carried it
carefully. fearful of sudden explosioii,i

Editor, The News:

it does not take a very ' tiite ob-
server to see that nearly all of the
sorial anti extra-curricular activities
V the session are promoted by a
small group of interested students.

This is an indictment against the
teachers who are iere. “i' will
say that they are here for the pur-
pow of studying. (iranteil. But they
should be able to forget. for six
\iceln. anyway. that they are pcdti-
counties. and try to bcroiiic sliiilenl‘
and enjoy a student's liie. A student
