tion for the summer?

short a period for such an associa-
tiuii to be worth while."

Mary Gordon, graduate of St.
Rose: “Yes. i think it would he a
good idea. it would help to unite
the student body. and it would give
its an opportunity to hear
good speeches."

rather novel window display. Thin
man didn't have much money for
advertising, so he bought the biggest
fiin bowl he could get hold of. ﬁlled
it with water. and put it in the win—
dow with this Sign:

“Filled with invisible goldﬁsh from
Argentine." It took [7 policemen to
handle the crowd.

lie: What's the difference between
the long skirts and prohihition?

She: Nothing. The same
joiotx, hut harder to ﬁnd.
