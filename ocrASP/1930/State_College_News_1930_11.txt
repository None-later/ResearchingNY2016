SNYDER OUTLINES
CENTRAL SCHOOL
ACT AT MEETING

The manner in which central school
districts are established under the
Central School Act of 1917 was out-
lined by Mr. Ray Snyder, head of the
division of rural education for New
York State, at the meeting of Chi
chapter of Kappa Phi Kappa, national
honorary education fraternity, con—
ducted recently.

He explained that the small two or
three room rural schools were being
consolidated into central schools with
larger faculties and better educational
facilities. “The impetus in the uper~
ation of the law is due to the fact
that the state recently voted ﬁnancial
aid for the project to the extent of
providing one-fourth of the cost of
the central school building and one-
half of the cost of carrying the stu-

dents to the school," M r. Snyder
said. "More than seventy of the
new distrlcts have al ready been

formed," he declared.

Tile adoption of the central school
is voluntary, the various rural dis-
tricts voting on the matter at a regu—
lar referendum. At present there are
approximately 7,000 one room schools
in the state.

The great advantages are more
elective subjects, greater opportuni-
ties for extra-curricular activities,
and more chances for individual coil-
L‘iCt for sports and lessons, Ml:
Snyder explained.

The great objection to the plan is
that parents are not enthusiastic about
sending their children five miles in .‘l
bus to the central school.

The men got rid of a lot of bad
playing in the Jamaica encounter,
and should come back with a bang
in the rest of their games and shew
their old time form. A reversal had
to come, and it is better to have it
happen early iii the season.

 

 

 

~ Clark, one of the big guns on
the ,quintet, threw his knee out
of joint, and will probably be
on the side lines for this week’s
contests.. He visited an osteo-
path early in the week, and the
treatment he received there may
allow him to play tomorrow.

Carl Olny, a graduate of Cornell,
a member of the crew, and a dis—
ciple of Gloomy Gil Dobic on the
foothill] field. where he starred as
fullback, handled the referee’s
whistle last night. Ben Becker will
probably omciate tomorrow.

 

A trophy will probably be
awarded to the winner of the
present men's interclass basket-
ball tournament which will be
suitably engraved, and placed in
the lounge room by the winner.
This trophy will probably be in
the form of a loving cup, and
will be purchased through the
contributions of the members of
the teams competing. The cup
will be placed in competition
each year.

Leo Allan clearly demonstrated
his right to a regular berth on the
varsity by his heady and cool hand—
ling of a team ready to blow up
last Saturday. His calmness under
ﬁre helped Captain W'lliston tremA
endously in keeping up the fighting
spirit of the team ill spite of the
score.

Splits 0n House Rules

The Good Fellowship Sunday
School class of the Madison Avenue
Presbyterian church, a group of State
college girls, discussed the house
rules recently. There was a division
of opinion, some thinking that girls
iil college are experienced enough to
supervise their own conduct without
the aid of house rules, while others
approved of them, according to Vera
‘ urns, ’32.. The discussion came up
in connection with study which the
class is making of the hook, "Facing
Student Problems,” written by Bruce
(furry who spoke in assembly re-
