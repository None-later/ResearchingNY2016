In a recent ncws article this publi-
cation announced lliat an entirely new
experiment in educational methods
would be tried out at Yale university
this fall. It is signiﬁcant that snih
a step, perhaps of momentous impor-
tance to the educational world in the
future. should be taken in this country.

It is time that attempts be made
to discover new methods oi education
to supplant successfully the old. The
old classroom theory. with its drill
and lack of individual opportunity.
must inevitany pass with the advent
of widespread use oi methods similar
to those to he used at Yale.

More and more it is becoming ap-
parent that students must be treated
as individual problem». rather than as
a mass. They must be given the
attention, instruction. and the oppor-
tunity to travel on ahead of their
classmates if they show ability to do
so. Such is one of the most dcsiralile
features of the new plan.

The nearest approach that Nate
college has to such a course the
advanced composition cl s: ot Dr.
Harold W. 'I‘lioi‘iipson Ill which the
students are |iCI'Illlllt‘tl to arrange their
own hours and to choose their own
Subjects, thus giving them as‘nnich
individual choice and freedom til the
matter a' is possible I” a teacher
training institution. ‘

The (.ollege needs more cl sses like
that of Ilr. ’I'hoiiipsoii. It inn make
every effort to avoid degenerating Into
a machine that turns out teachers'by
mass production without having first
fully exploited mdivnlual abilities aitd
possibilities. It is this new tendency
that has caught the Imagination of
American educators today. More and
more t‘iiglllmlllt‘t‘ is being taken of the
advantagcs oi the Il('\V over the old.

State college must contribute its

THE SUMMER NEWS

INTO THE PAST

Occasionally. even in this day
and time. we run into what might
be termed a new angle on things
in general. Nothing really new
under the sun but just a new slant
on things that were once here and
accorded their proper signiﬁcance
iii the scheme of events.

We are referring specifically to
the history research tours conducted
the history department. It
seems to us that there could not
be a more delightful or instructive
way of presenting the all important
details of historical events than by
these very trips. Not only does the
main theme of the event become
firmly impressed upon one's con—
sciousness but the fascinating little
details. which are as dry its so niuch
dust when read in print. become
living vital elements of surprise and
education. .\ battle in a history
book does not bring up conscious
thoughts of the terrain over which
the opposing forces had, to move.
but when it is seen at first hand.
each small gully and hedge over
which the cavalry had to movc cit-
haiices its importance a thousand-
told. The action we receive is
very much akin to lhc feelings of
pcople when they saw the mining
pictures of .\diniral Ilyi'd's polar

According to Dr. t'ounts. I'rofessor
oi luducation at Kansas 'I'eachcrs L'ol-
li-ge, our American schools are not at
all what they should be. He linds
thcin mechanically efﬁcient but socially
failures. It scellh that we have em
tern-d a new era without di-vciopiiig
a new philosoph) to suit it. Most of
Ur. ('oimts facts arc collected from

’I‘hi'ougliout our system he sees the
