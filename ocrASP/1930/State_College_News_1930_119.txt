OFFERS THANKS

The Nun's lloard wishes to thank
the members of the faculty and those
students of the summer ion who
have so kindly acted as reporters, or
voluntarily contributed articles to the
SUMMER Nun's, We realize that the
summer sesston means a busy season
for the majority of us, and in view of
this fact, we appreciate this all the
more.

 

APPRECIATION

The announcement that the students
of the summer session have hcard the
last of the organ recitals played by
Dr. Harold W. 'l'hompson (hiring the
past series is heard with regret.

The News wishes to take this op—
portunity to thank Dr. 'l‘liompson on
behalf of the students here and to
assure him that his efforts have
earned the gratitude of his hearers.

The summer students lime
very fortunate in having an organist

been

of the national reputation oi lJr.
'l‘liompson to play for them. His
'l'hursdiiy afternoon recitals con-

tributed to the routine of the term a
highly desirable artistic clement which
has been conspicuously lacking. To
Miss lilcanor l’oole. his assistant. also
the thanks of the students for her
effort to make the session a varied
and interesting one.

The Nun's hopes that when tlic
term is opened for this Ilcxl ‘t'sbltill
Dr. ’l‘hoiupson may be prevailed upon
to again offer the students the op-
portunity to hear him play

THE SUMM

six weeks chock ﬁll of mental and
physical pursuits, we are preparing
ourselves for the Big Push, so-termed
military parlance, namely the
ﬁnal examinations. After a very slow
start due to a feeling of strangeness,

the students did not mingle rapidly.
However this state of aﬁ'airs ended
soon enough and it wasn't long be-
'ore new friendships had been cc-

' found

 

mented and common intere:
liy one student in another.
innovations from the last summer 5 '
siotl were the inauguration of a b;
ball team, and a series of organ re-
citals, together with the blossoming
forth of the Summer " from a
mimeographcd edition to the present
printed form. The .-\nnual fiance
conducted last week proved very suc-
ccsful in the opinion oi all partici-
pants. The Saturday bus trips under
the capable guidance of Dr» Anna
W. Risley and llonual \". Smith of
the history department, afforded both
educational and recreational interest
for a large ntniiher of students.

We are sorry to say liowcv '
I number of people held the i.
aloof from us and our activities per-
haps thinking they were too old for
.uch entertainments. or perhaps feel-
ing indifferent to our attempts at
creating a homogeneous atmosphere
during our so-journ at Statc t‘ollcgc.
If it were the latter state we can do
iothing or very little as. according

education courses. this ﬁrm”) oi

Those of you who read “The
Shepherd of the Hills,” and “the
Winning of Barbara Worth," must
add "Exit" to your list. Perhaps
the next generation will have more
respect for Mr. Wright's literary
ability—perhaps not. At least we
suspect it will be much talked of
and the best seller of the year.

AFFAIRS OF STATE

By Ray Collins

The Annual Summer Frolic proved
a howling success. The new gym-
nasium was gorgeously and skillfully
decorated with a splendid blend of
colors and was bravely protected dur-
ing the course of the evening by the
decorators. The main struggle took
place from ‘) to 12 while the side
shows were widespread over the
campus. Owing to the careful efforts
of the manager, the stagline was di-
minished. The young manager also
gave his admirers an opportunity to
observe his masterful ability on the
floor when be featured many pleasing

steps.

    

 

Manager Alaslan has definitcly dc-
citled to pull the curtain on the base-
ball season and from a stranger's
point of view it was a very successful

a great advantage and as a result
the boys were ill a constant state
of ferment until dawn drew the cur-
tain on the drama.
