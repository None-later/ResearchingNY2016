THE SUMMER NEWS

Dr. Bernard Smith May
Conduct Trip In I93I

l’ield trips to sites of historic in-
terest in the Capitol District have
proven of such value to history stu—
dents at the summer session that
they will be continued next year for
the beneﬁt of the IQ.“ summer classes,
Dr, Dunnal V. Smith of the history
department, announced today.

"ie two outstandng excursions
undertaken this summer were those to
the site of the Saratoga Battlefield
at Saraiuua. including visits to all
nearby places of historic connection

 

with the battle. and that of llowes'
('averns of last week. A trip to the
Hudson 'l‘raiuine school was also con-l

ducted. I

Students at the summer session are
particularly fortunate in studying
here, since the district around Albany
is outstandineg rich in historic
events. Dr. Smith said. It was
around here that many famous battles
of the French and Indian War and
the American Revolution were fought,
' in}: many mementoes of the con-

  

ic visits lo historic places is
valuable also from the viewpoint that
it gives to the instructor a clearer
vision of the events which he is
lL‘fli'llIIlR' and thus enables him to
transfer to his students a more en»
lightened and accurate picture of
the happenings. Dr. Smith believes.
'l‘entalive plans for a trip to Boston
next summer are being considered by
llr. Smith. lizinueil Hall and other
buildings of Revolutionary interest as
well as Lexington and Concord will
he visited if I)r. Smith's plans are
carried through.

SOCIOLOGY CLASS
VISITS BUILDINGS
OF ALBANY COUNTY

The Albany County Buildings were
visited by the Sociology and Econo-
mics classes last Monday afternoon.
They found portions of the buildings
still under construction. According to
Professor Walker, head of the econo-
mics department, Albany had its in-
stitutions for the care of dependents
such as the home for tubercular child-
ren, and county aims house, scattered
over several parts of the county. Re—
cently. like many other progressive
counties, Albany determined to hold
these together in the interest of econo-
my and effectiveness in work. They
therefore purchased land from the
Shakers near what is now the Albany
airport. Here they built the Aim Lee
l‘lome for the aged, the hospital home
for the care of tubercular children, and
are rapidly completing the county
penitcntary. Ann Lee was the founder
of the Shaker religion and the audi-
torium is the old Shaker IlleetinieI
House.

When completed it is to be one
of the best units of the sort in New
York State. He added that a
community may be judged by two
lines of its work and their ef-
fectiveness, First. by its ulucational
system which prepares those who are
gettini,l ready to live, and second, by
its care of dependents. Judged l)_\'
these standards, Albany county has a
good showing.
