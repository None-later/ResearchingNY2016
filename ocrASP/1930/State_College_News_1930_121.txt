_____.._____—~

One of our schoolmates, class of
’31, writes "And it you make Al-
bany this Campus Day, I promise
to set up all the beers you can
drink." That’s what we call a real
son of Alma Mater. lncidently,
the dear boy had better save all his
pennies his summer; we’re raising
an east-of Suez thirst.

We've done it again! We declare,
we're almost as proliﬁc as Robert
Burns! This time it‘s a sonnet, and
the piece hears the immoral title——
but wait. you shall see the last line:

And "hnttoms up!" to Kendrick's
in the morn!

How lovely liret llarte‘s ﬁrst t'(ll-
tion looked on our mantlevpiece! llut
we searched and searched and——
Eureka! There they are side hy side.

Alasi New York ain't New York
anymore! \\'itness: We had to light
for a seat on the Fifth Avenue llus
at Washinutnn Square; we rode clear
up to Washington Heights and didn't
hear "Down at Dinty Moore's." ln
tact, dear readers—and it hurts us
to tell this to you—there wasn't a
harmonica or a uke on the bus!

Sight Seeing In Italy

by Michael Tepedino

This is my ﬁrst attempt to write‘
a news article, As Will Rogers
would say "I see by the papers,’
so I must imitate that illustrious
person and begin hy saying, "The
recent earthquake in ltaly reminds
me.”

Three years ago l was travelling
in Italy and was in the vicinity of
Vesuvius when an eruption oc»
curred. It was too hot for com-
fort. We Wen- being guidcd'
through l'onIpeii by a young man
who had seen a few performances
before, lle told me he had, on dif~
lcrclit occasions, held ring-side . . s
which didn't cost him a cent. 'l‘hat

 

 

THE SUMMER NEWS

day when old "Vessic," as it is
called locally, began to show her
teeth I was only too glad to get
in a remote and quiet vicinity.

Returning to the hotel that cvc-
ning, I was faced with the most
disagreeable task of ﬁlling out some
for the ltalian police. Police an.
thorities make it their business to
check up on all travelers. The last
question on the blank madcunc
start. "Are you a lunatic?" was
written in bold type. I hesitated.

thought of Pompeii. old "Vussie,"
and the danger. The pen was dry,
and I was wondering, No sane
person would have ventured to get
a piece of lava for a souvenir in the
very month of the Dragon.

Quite a few students have asked
me why the Italians continue to live
near Vesuvius. The only answer
to that question is that they must
own property there and can not
leave. Without doubt, they would
joyfully consider selling their lands
to any American realty concern.

Premier Mussolini in a recent ad-
dress failed to mention anything
about the iron hand in connection
with the earthquakes, According to
the politicians, Mussolini has had
free rein so far except for the con—
trol of these tremor- which are dis—
turhinp, the equilibrium of his
people.
