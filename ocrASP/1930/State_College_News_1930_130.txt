LIBRARY EX TENDS
LOAN PERIOD FOR
RESERVED BOOKS

In response to the numerous pro-
tests registered on the library ques-
tionnaire last year, it has been decided
to lengthen the time for using re-
served hooks during the day from
two to three hours, according to Miss
.‘lary li. L'obh, College librarian.

"Students are requested to keep rc-
served books only wliic they are
actually in use, so that others may
iave a fair chance to obtain them,“
Miss Cobb said.

Some other suggestions offered to
help in relieving the congestion in the
library are:

I’lan ivork as far as possible in ad-
vance; start work in library, or re-
serve books for future use immediately
after receiving assignments, so that
the hooks will not lie idle until just
before the quiz when they become
very much in demand; have all books
and magazines charged at the desk
before taking them from the library.

A complete list of the library rules
will be posted on the bulletin board
outside the library. and will be avail-
able to all new students, Miss Cobb
announced.
