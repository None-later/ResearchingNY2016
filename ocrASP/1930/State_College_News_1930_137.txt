Sophomore Clan To Publish
Fin! Activities Scrap-Book

The sophomore class is insti-
tutiiig a new feature this year
by the establishing of a class
scrap-book. The book will con-
taiii snap-shots and clippings of
the various class activities which
will be submitted by the class
members.

Additions will be made to the
book each year, so that when the
class has reached its senior year
there will be material available
for use in the 1933 I’edagogue
and the class history section.

2 Irina Lewis, class reporter,
has been appointed to have
charge of the scrap—book this
year. The material already col-
lected for the book includes
pictures of the outing which the
class took last year at Professor
Richmond H. Kirtluiid's country

nine, and various individual
Movingniip day photographs.
