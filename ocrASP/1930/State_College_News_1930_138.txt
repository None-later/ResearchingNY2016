The lreshman class is rather rich
in athletic material according to
authentic reports. At least three
ycai'lings. Bancroft, Saunders, and
Garritt, all of whom have had
basketball experience in big
school, will form the starting
nucleus around which Coach Baker
will build the freshmen quintet.
Saunders has played baseball also
and will be given a chance. next
spring to bolster up a hole in the
inﬁeld.

Within the past four or ﬁve years, debating has enjoyed such a revival of

interest here that it has again assumed

genuine mental training and enjoyment.

Besides, it provides a source of real

sportsmzmship, kccn competitive spirit, and mental activity.

l‘hc history of the debate council is not a long one.

During the school

year of 1927-28, several students who were anxious to see debating hold its
iormcr place of importance in the College took a deﬁnite step in that direction

by founding the council. Its purposes

The counctl is composed of a debate
coach who is a member of the faculty.
The present coach is Dr. Harold W.
’l‘hompson, professor of English. Due
to an internal revision of its organiza—
tion, the council is now Composed of
three seniors and three juniors. The
sophomores who are chosen are named
at the end of their second year and
serve on the council for the remainder
of their undergraduate days. They
are chosen on the basis of intercst
and ability in debating.

Student members of the council are:
Dorothy Abrams, Lawrence C. New-
emnb, and myself, seniors; and Ruth
Krouman. Kenneth Miller, and George
I’. Rice, juniors.

During, the past three years the
men's and women's teams have comv
piled a record oi six consecutive vio
tories in competition with teams
representing colleges of high reptltni

met in debate are: St. Lawrence
university, Boston university, Vassar.
Hamilton, Union, University of Pitts-
burgh, and Victoria university of New
/.ealand.

men‘s team, participated in its irst

Graduation of the class of 1930 has
lost much good material that cannot
well be spared. Nevertheless, the
council looks to the remaining classes
to provide for the successors oi the
graduates. It also looks to the asso-

moral support necessary to a success-
ful season by sportmanlikc attendance
