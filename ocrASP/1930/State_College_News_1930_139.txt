HOME RUNS are made at the

plate —- not on the bench!
Likewise what counts in a ciga-

rette is what a smoker gets from

it-—- not what is said about it.

Chesterﬁeld has a policy—give

smokers what they want:

MILDNESS— the wholly nat-

ural mildness

of mbaeeos that are

without harshness or bitterness.
BETTER TASTE—such as only

a cigarette of wholesome purity

and better tobaccos can have.
