RICE in MILLER
i T0 DEB_A:I‘_E sons

Dr. Harold W. Thompson Picks
Two Juniors to Represent
State College

Two juniors, Kemieth A. Miller
Ind George P. Rice. have been
chosen to represent State college in
the proposed debate with the repre-
‘sentatives of the Scottish universities.

They were named at a meeting of
the debate council last week by Dr.
Harold W. 'l‘honipson, coach of de-
bate and professor of English. A
vote of the council had given him
the power to name the team. The
men were chosen in Iliis manner
rather than the usual competitive try—
out method because of lack of time,
members of the council said.

If the debate takes place here Fri-
day, October .24, the team will debate
John M. Mat‘Corinick and Norman
A. B. Wilson. 11 will he the first
two-man debate that State college has
ever scheduled for the men's team
and will be the second international
debate in which its teams have ever
participated.

Last year the men met New Zea-
land in a non~decision debate. The
Scottish team has suggested that there
.he no decision in their proposed de-
bate here.

Both Miller and Rice have had pre-
vious experience on the men's varsity,
Miller having been alternate in three

   

debates last year and a member of
'the sophomore c: s team last March.
R has been a member ot the

men's varsity team 2 a speaker for
three cons :utive years and for two
years was t ptain of his class team
in the intcrclass rivalry debates. |
