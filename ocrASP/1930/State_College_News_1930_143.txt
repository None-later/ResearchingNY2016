State collcgc students will have an unparalleled op—
portunity to hear one of the most famous of modern
poets when \iachcl Lindsay appears in the auditorium
of Page hall nth \\’educsday night under the auspices
of the State college alumni association.

His poclry is noted for its unusual rhythmic effects.
and undoubtedly a rare treat is witth the grasp of
anyone who has a proper standard of values.

.A 50 per cent reduction in the price of tickets has
boon arranged for the students by the committee in
charge, and the students are urged to take advantage
of this chance. It may not occur again.

 

EXIT: ('fllffjllhi ./\l\'l) SNICI‘IZICS

(.‘onstruction of an inclosure in the pcristylc leading
from Hustcd hall to Richardson hall is nearly completed,
and already the stnrlcnts have noticed and appreciated
the difference. Although more than the traditional "few
cents" have been expended in tints prOiL‘cting the stu~
dents frqu inclcmcut wcathcr. the returns in freedom
from colds. coughs and succzcs in about 1100 future
teachers of New York state is worth all the moncy
being spent. It is thought that the twenty students who
were oInittcd from the above estimate would catch colds
anyway.

One circumstance that is inIconnirchcnsihlc. ltowcvcr.
is why the under-passage which is already in being was
not utilized rather than constructing this addition, no
matter how welcome.

Ni) .\lllltl“. .\l.llllS

When the students returned to College this fall they
appreciated the fact that the facilities of the College
library had been enlarged by the addition of scvcral
tables and reading lights placed near the library on the
second floor of llrapcr hall. Seats in the library arc
always at a premium and any incrcasc in their number
is welcomed.

Today Miss Mary li. l'nbh, (.‘ullcgc librarian, an~
nounccs a further improvement in the library facilities
through the co-opcratiou of IlIc tullllllCl‘l'c department.
Rooms on the third floor of liraper hall have been madc.
available for any students who fail to obtain place» to;
study in the library.

STATE COLLEGE NEWS, FRIDAY, OCTOBER 17, 1930

two of these conventions saying that the concensus 0
opinions of the delegates was against such payment.

It is a well-known fact that editors of many collegiate
publications are paid. But the majority of papers take
the opposite stand. The college journalist must have
a different attitude. He should work for the pleasure
derived from the occupation without the additional rc-
ward of a cash onus.

Collected Poems. Ify f'nr/Irl Lint/my. 464 pages. Mac-

millan, New York. $3.50.

Interest in the poetry of Vachcl Lindsay has certainly
been stimulated by his scheduled lecture in Page hall
on October 22. To rcud his Collected Poems is to
acquaint oneself with the poet before he arrivcs.

The collection rcprcscuts Lindsay in every phase upon
which he has written. It contains all 0 his pot-Ins
together with many illustrations engraved by the author
himself. The collection has been dedicated to Sarah
Tcasdalc. poet.

Americ' 1 critics have hailed Lindsay as the outstand-
ing {\mcr ‘au poet of the day. They have said that be
best expresses the spirit of the youth and this latter
criti ism is borne out by his collection.

Among the more interesting and better known poems
l‘Cl)rCSClllCll arc “Congo”, “'l‘hc Chinese Nightingale",
and “The Trial of the Dead Cleopatra".

To read h‘ poems is to see him in many different
lights. llc is at various times the prcacher, the prophet.
and the protagonist. And at times he is the dreamer
and siugcr of lyrics. His works in many instances show
deep and quiet feeling.

it has been said that the present production of the
poet is but a milestone on a career of remarkable poten-
tialities. But that can be told only in the future. Suﬂice
it to s' . the purchase of the volume will be well worth
the price. In addition. sponsors of his reading here have
declared that he will autograph volumes. which may be
added inccutivc for the addition of this book to the
library of modern poetry.

THE STATESMAN

llv lx’xv L'oI.I.INs

The all-State dance gave the men their ﬁrst break of
the year as they did not experience that strong opposi-
tion from their respective neighbors, Union and R. P. 1.
There was an apparent era of good feeling and as the
evening progressed the co—cds became very congenial in
spite of the severe cramping of their style. However,
they were deeply grieved when at ll o'clock thcir gentle-
man fricuds informed them that it was time to go home.
in fact one fair co-cd remarked that it was really too
early for intermission to say nothing about making final
break. The orchestra gave the students ample time to
rehearse their steps between dances as they frequently
found it necessary to inspect the campus.

 

 

 

 

 

Bv virtuc of the decision of the freshmen the crowning
of the campus qnccn tomorrow will undoubtedly reveal
the ideal of the senior class. We sincerely trust that the
l-‘rosh have ex -rcised the utmost care in arriving at their
difﬁcult dcciston. The men are waiting anxiously for
their queen whom they hope will be exactly what they
ordered. while the women remain also in nvcry anticir
patory mood.

 

in order to carry out the principle of continuity. thc
sorm‘itlt.“ will conduct their house dance the night after
Senior llop. This will avoid the ncccssIty of changing
gaI'IIn-nts and also add to the convenience of the guests
who undoubtedly will be iIIIportcd from many rcmotr
places. inrltni .‘ Shushan, llnskirks. ('I‘owhill, .\thol.
