The value of membership in the National Student
Federation of America will be illustrated tonight when
the men's varsity debate team takes the floor against a
team representing the Scottish universities. The contest
has been arranged with the cooperation of the executive
secretary of the association. it is the National Student
Federation of .-\tncrica which is sponsoring the entire
American tour of both the Scottish squad and a team
representing several (,ierinaii universities.

The debate is valuable in that it adds to the prestige
and reputation of State college. The contest will he
the second international debate in which this College
has been represented. Further, State college is the only
college in the Capitol District ever to schedule an inter-
national debate.

The contest will do much to develop better inter-
national understanding. One of the best methods of
disseminating itlc 5 international in scope and for inter—
national benefit is through the medium of their young
people. So it is that in addition to entertaining audi-
ences on their American tour, these young Scottiin
gentlemen will be the ambassadors of their country to
the Unith States and to its colleges and uiiivcrsi 'cs.

State college is pleased at the opportunity to we come
the representatives of the Scottish universities and to
participate iii a forensic contest in which they are a
party. It is good for the College and is bciicﬁcial for
the Scottish universities

When lithcl (irundhofer, '30, last year's L'ampus
Queen. stepped from behind the curtain on the stage
in the auditorium of Page hall Saturday night in order
to perform the coronation ceremony, she began a custom
which future queens will do well to follow, The clement
of surprise would be lacking of course, but the bcauty
of the exercises would be accentuated, and il\ lllll‘llttst'
clarified.

.\laiiy persons in the audience did not appreciate the
signiﬁcance of Miss f.irtiii(|liofcr's crowning ltt'l' suc-
ccsstu’, nor its symbolism. To overcome this ilifliculty
these suggestions are oflercd‘

Only one advantage seems to shine forth. It is that
the class will be able to accumulate a large sum for its
gift to the College. It will also result in building up
a stable surplus for next year‘s events.

Nevertheless, the class treasurer has his work cut out
for the coming year. It will take much extra effort to
extract this stu'n from the inetnbers of the class.

And upon the present class must be placed the prece-
dent which has been started by approving a budget so
needlessly large.

(For Sale in the Co—op)
'lilw Dev/Munro Stream by Dorothy Canﬁeld. 393 pages.
Harcourt, Brace and Company, New York. $3.00.

The influences which an inherently fine woman may
have tipoii ordinary unsciisatioual life and the changes
she may bring about may be said to be the themes of
this book, which is the latest one Miss Caulield has
written.

in other ways it may be called a comparison of life
as it seems or ought to be and life as it really is. Upon
these factors the three main characters of the book cou~
struct their philosophy of life and the way they desire
to live it.

The stream of life flows on tranquilly and undis-
turbed by the minor triumphs and failures of petty
humanity, but .\liss Canﬁeld has carefully and pains.
takineg analyzed the lives of a small group with miuutc
distinctiveness. She has shown, that although life sceni-
iiigly flows along smoothly, yet certain currents make
deeper impressions and changes than are readily oli-
served.

Scenes in the book shift. The book begins with scenes
with which the reader may be familiar~tlie acrimony
of the breakfast table and the private actions of the
family, shamelessly enacted before the members of Ilic
family and the puiin and display : sunicd at the (Ulll'
inaiid of reception room convention

It begins as the story of three lives, but gradually the
author develops the character of one to the estcnt of
shadowing the others. The three children, hiatey, l’ris-
cilla, and lirau are subjected to changes in environ-
inent——from college towns to France and back again to
other college towns and new atmospheres. 'l'lic shifts
from the Hudson of W iingtou lrviiig to war-time
l . provide good mate for the author for new
scenes, moods, and iiicidcn , which are woven into the
story and the lives of the characters. particularly .\fatcy.

With welbdevclopcd mature power and willi sym-
pathy and human understamling, Miss t'anficld has made
her chapters intense with life. 15 use the author has
been somewhat wordy, the tale is rather long.

it is another notable accomplishment of onc who
rightly ranked a woman of letters.

Years which a student spends in college should be
