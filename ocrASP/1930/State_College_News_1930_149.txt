of the New York State police, and is
now on the speaking staff of the
. M. C. A. Mr. Eddy is particularly

interested in college questions.

Mr. Eddy attended the freshmen
dinner two years ago at which little
he discussed the problems of sex rela-
tionship and also the danger growing
out of monopolies, l)r. Eddy claims
that education does not consist pri-
marily in getting a degree, but that
it comes only when the student of
today learns how to cope with prob-
lems of modern civilization. One of
these most modern and present day
problems is that which concerns itself
with sex relationship. but this accord»

Mr. Eddy greatly assails the Amer-
ican student as being too docile and
compares them with the students of
foreign lands who, he asserts are far
in advance of the student of this
country. As for religion, he defines
it as “our best conceptions of what
is right, gained from our experiences
and those of others, and the organiza—
tion of life on that basis."
