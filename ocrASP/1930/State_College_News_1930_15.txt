Fire, caused by a short circuit

twenty members of Kappa D ta

Rho fraternity at 480 Morris

street from their beds into the

street at 3 o’clock Wednesday
morning.

A ﬁre truck responded to a
call settt in by Mrs. Frederick
Smith, a neighbor. The entire
cellar was bttrttcd out, although
the furniture on the ﬁrst and
second floors was unharmed,
save for smoke.

The ﬁre was discovered by
Frank Ott, '31, who was sleep-
ing on the ﬁrst floor. Halt suf-
focated, he made his way to the
street and aroused the rest of
the men who were in the house.

The men were forced to re—
main in the street until the
smoke had cleared front the
rooms. The total damage was
slight, Rudolph \Vurth, ’30, con-
sul, said today.

This injury hindered him from show-
ing his customary ability in caging
the ball after a fast follow in. The
men seemed to be off form and per~
formed in a rugged manner, showing
very little team work. The brilliant
playing of Captain \Vhiston and Leo
Allan stood out in the team’s cour~
ageous but vain attempt to subdue the
invaders, who played more or less in-
dividually but with deadly accuracy
in scoring punch.

The following contest with Cooper
Union was played with only a two
day interval. and the team did not
seem to have fully recovered from
the Clarkson game. Clark was in
the line-up but was hampered by his
njttry and had trouble in holding
his man.

The whole varsity defense crum-
bch suddenly. The visiting team's
forwards got away front their men
to score frequently. Captain Winston
