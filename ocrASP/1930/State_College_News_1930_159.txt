Who Has The Banner? Question
of Members of Chm of I 932

“Banner. banner, where is the
banner. who has the banner”; this
is the new game that several en-
thusiastic members of the junior
class have been playing as they
assiduously searched the College
buildings and premises for the
yellow and white ensign.

The banner was brought to the
College on the night of campus
(lay by Annabelle McConnell, ’31,
chairman of the decorations, to use
in decorating the gymnasium. The
other class custodians failed to
bring their banners, therefore the
junior banner was not used, and
was left backstage. When Miss
McConnell returned to recover the
banner, it had disappeared.

Already an org‘ tiZL'tl Search
party has been appointed to dis-
cover the whereabouts of the in-
signa. with unarailing efforts.
thus far, accoriliin,r to M. (‘nrtis
Ix‘iitcniber, president of the class.
ltuteniber hopes to recover the
banner before the junior prom.

V-NECKLINE TO BE
STYLE 0!“ STATE
CO-EDS' DRESSES

(Canunncd {mu [mac 1, column t)
scrvation showed that the majority
were even lines.”

A fashion report compiled from the
style magazines mentioned above
shows that the feminine mode, which
is the leading one, is sub-divided into
the classic, the romantic, the dramatic,
the demure, and the sportif.

Although hair dressers are pushing
short hair, illustrations indicate a long
hair effect even when the hair I!
short.

llein line lengths are front twelve
to fourteen inches from the ﬂoor of
daytime wear, and down to the ankles
for evening wear.

“The method of determining style
trends by actual count is the modern
way of setting styles. Fashion stylists
no longer push a certain style simply
because some prominent person has
been seen wearing it. They must
hack the style tip with observations,
indicating what percentage of a cer-
tain number of people seen at a cer»
lain place were seen wearing the
style." .\irs. Ilarsain sail.

.-\ phrase which is indicative of
this i: one which is found constantly
in the \\'mn.‘in's \\"ear, which always
,a“ they are wearing thus and so,"
rather than “the style is."

"'l‘iic study of styles which we have
made has conducted in the same man-
ner in which styles are set," Mrs.
liai'sznn said “’l‘hrongh this study,
we ili~rnvcred what the style is at
State t'lllit'jll‘. and by studying the
trend as shown by magazines, we
found that iI t‘lits‘ely parallels that of
other college girls in the country,"
she added.

1932 Elects Til; Men

rich wrre elected representatives of
