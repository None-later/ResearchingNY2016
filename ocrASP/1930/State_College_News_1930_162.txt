 LIFE or BENJAMIN FRANKLIN
. A snoitT HISTORY or WOMEN
_ (For Sale in the Co-up)
Bt‘lljtllllfll Franklin. By Phillips Russell.

Books, New York. 332 pages. 

 

Blue Ribbon

The title of the ﬁrst civilized American is aptly be-
stowed upon Benjamin Franklin. In the period previous
to the Revolution, a time eminent for narrowness, super-
stition, and nnsmiliug bleakucss, Franklin showed him-
self to he inventive. generous, mirthful, penetrating,
learned, and tolerant.

Franklin was born in 1706 and was a mature man
with a record of successful patriotic service while \Vaslt-
ingtnn and the other men who were to become leaders
(I the Revolution were still wrapped in swaddling
clothes.

Few men have started as candle—makers and reached
the heights of intcruatiomtl recognition in as many fields
as did I’rnnkliu. li'anve. England, and other I'Iuropean
nations showered upon him honors in recognition

 

achievements as a statesman, scientist, and public spirited
citizen.

Moderation in living seemed to be his \vI'ItI'IiIvord. III-
thIIugh his most marked characteristic, according to Mr.
Ix'usscll. was "a gusto for living." 1

III criticism. it Inu~t Ilt' admitted that the publisher of,

History Of Senior Society Sketched;
First Myskania Selected By Faculty

Myskania began in I?” as a “student council," whose members were
selected by the faculty. It has developed into a secret honor council of
seniors who have led in scholarship, literary effort. debate, dramatics. and
undergraduate aﬂ'airs generally. It is the purpose of Myskania at all times
to uphold the traditions of the College and to give its best energies to
turning the student mind and activities into channels which will promote
the deepest and truest interests of State allege.

Along with the change in the method of selecting new members, which
has eliminated faculty control, there has come a new metho of “tapping.”
The early Myskanias were "a " as the whole junior class marched
across the platform of the auditorium, members reaching out to “tap” the
new members as they passed.
