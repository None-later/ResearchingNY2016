 . STARS ToNlGIl’lk-TBASDMX

(For Sale in the Co-ap)
Starr 'l‘v-Niglil. By Sara Teasdale. MacMillan Com:
pany. New ork. 49 pages. $2.00

Publication of a new book of poems by Stu
Teasdale is always a welcome event for her myriad
of readers. This latest group of poems portrays tlt
feeling of Miss Teasdale for the stars and she list
them iii extraordinary description. Perhaps chit-i
among them are»: "To Arcturus Returning," “Calm
Morning at Sea," and “The Falling Star,"

These poems are all lyrics; all of them have the
long virtue of shortness. Her style is liiupitl and
clear as the surface of a lake. There are un strait
words nor obscure meanings to distract the rt der':
mind. llcr lilies have a musical quality which is iv
of the qualities that distinguishes them from imita-
tioit poetry.

Beauty. \vouder. mystery, and reverence for tli
night and its twinkling diadctn are portrayed it
every pociii. V
The book should hold an added appeal for Alli
inns and students of the College, since the bi-aiitifi
‘litil ' 'iiativi: illustrations for the book and ftl‘
the dual poems are the creations of :\llS:~
Dorothy l". Lathrop, a Albanian, who has previou..
done most of the pictures for Miss ’l‘easdale's works

The varsity squad has been prac-

weeks and all the men are in tip-
top condition for the game with
the New Yorkers. If the players
reveal the speed and sharp shoot-

have exhibited in their practice
scrimmages the visitors will have
a difﬁcult time to keep the score
