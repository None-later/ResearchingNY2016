.‘\]I|)I'(lNilllillt2i_\' ISSU inches of news
and editorial material has been printeu
in the News during the ﬁrst ten
issues, according to tabulations made
today by the NH“ 5 board. The above
amount is 550 inches less than thi.
total amount of the lirst teii issue.
of last year's .\'t:\\'.s‘. 'l‘his decreasc
in copy is atliibnted to the fact that
more space \Vila devoted to advertising
than is shown by Illal year‘s taiinla
lion.

George P. Rice, '31. managing
editor, heads the list of the tota
number of published inches with 47.
inches. :\l\'ititt Lewis, '33, desk editor,
follows with a sum oi 344 inches
Ilernard Kerliel. '33, .stafl reporter, i
third with I70 inches. while t‘atherint
Ii. Broderick. Kll. associate managing
editor is fourth with N Illt‘llc..
Alexander Siltnor. Ill. ieatui'e editor.
is ﬁfth with 70 inches. Eighty-three
inches of the total pn‘-lislied have
beeii submitted by enh reporters.

I’roiiiotioit to higher stall position}
and to board positions, in the ease of
juniors and lllltlcrvt'lllhslllt‘ll, are iasen
partly upon the amount of inches ac»
credited to the candidates, according
to the News hoard. tlther factor
Considered are: dependability of tilt
reporter in covering his assignment
and reportng of the stories on time

l’roiiiotion also depends upon lllt
initiative of the reporter. the t]ll.’|IlI_\
of his writing. and e.\tra work wliic.
is performed by stali ineiiihers, site.
as writing headlines, reading Copy
and clerical (Iltllts. In the case o
cnh reporters. regular attendance a
the .\'i,\\s tiil\\l‘.\ is :i factor coir
sidereil for promotion.

The t’tilltlllt'lt' tabulation as listed
helow is not roniplete the hoard ex
plained. 'l'lti: is due to the fact that
some reporters failed to Sign for the
stories uhirh they have written. The
list below represents the acetiratt
totals for all the signed stories. It

This Little Tube Measures Stars
Centuries of Light Years Distant

Y MEANS of a new vacuum tube called it low—grid-current Plio‘

tron tube, astronomers can gather the facts of stellar news

with greater speed and accuracy. In conjunction with a photoelectric

tube, it will help render information on the amount ol'lighr radiation

and position of stars centuries of light years away. It is further

applicable to such laboratory uses as demand the most delicate

measurement of electric Current.

So sensitive is this tube, that it can measure ().ttt)0.()tit),0t)(),t)()t),()()(),0l

of an ampere, or, one-hundredth of a millionth of it billionih ofan

ampere. This amount of current, compared with that of a 50-watt

incandescent lamp, is as two drops of water compared with the entire

volume of water spilled over Niagara Falls in a year.
