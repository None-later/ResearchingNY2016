“Coleman” Will Resign

From Position

Occupied For Last Twenty Two Years

Leo'l“~ Cole-man, more popularly
known as "Coleman," will resign his
job as assistant to die chicl’ettuiiieer
Monday, after completing tweiity-twu
years of service. Coleman will take
a three months' leave of absence be-
fore taking up the duties of another
position.

After twetity-two years of service,
Mr. Coleman is one of few remain-
ing people who were ‘soeiated with
the State Normal school. He came
into service itt 1909 at the tititc when
Dr. William J. Milne was president
of the institution. “Colt-titan" re-
members the changes that occurred in
the faculty after the death of Dr.
Milne.

 

l‘le recalls the excitement here

on the first ﬂoor of Draper hall.

noticed in the student body, he \illtl

carefully the differences in the ~‘ltt-

as l have associated with the sin

bodies are the same," lie declared.

social events about the school." it
maintains that the State Normal
school extra-curricular events were
more numerous, and participation
more enthusiastic than they are in
the College today. "The de rations
in the gymnasium \vlien dances were
more

 

to be conducted there were
