TROUBADORS PLAN
SHOW, MARCH 21

Organization Chooses Directors;
Proceeds of Last Year's
- Show To Be Ulcd

March 2| was the tentative date
selected by the Troubadours, men's
ininstrel organization, for its annual
show this year. The presentation
will probably follow the lilies of
the show given last year, and will
include a circle and several olios
and plays, according to Roval
Knox, '31, president.

Instead of a single chairman who
will be solely responsible for the
show. several persons will have
charge of the (Iiﬂ'crciit features of
the presentation. Knox said.
Among those who were suggested
for posnions as directors are:
Lawrence Newcomb, lrvnn,r Mc-
Connell and Daniel (,orr, seniors:
Samuel S. Dransky, '32: and
Bruce l’ilby. '33.

The directors Will have a decided
advantage this year, Knox said. in
that funds for costumes, iiialte-up,
and manuscript are available as the
lroubadonrs now have over one
hundred dollars. This sum repre-
sents the proceeds of the show
given last year.

Whether the 'l‘roubadonrs will

present the show at the Ioessel-
ville high school as in two former
years is not yet decnlcd, Ixnox an-
nounccd.
I Last year‘s show was the best
in the history of the organization
both hnaiicially and otherwise,
Knox declared. With only $40.00
with which to start the year. the
'l‘roubaduurs were able to secure
a picture Ill the I’edagoguc, and
yet finish the year with about
$115.00. I If the interest which
characterized last year's perform-
ance does not peter out. there is
every reason to expect _another
successful season, the oflit't-rs oi
the organization said. 'lhe largr

Several students have been placed
through the efforts of the student
employment agency sponsored by‘
the Young Men's Christian asso-1
ciation, according to Samuel S.
Dransky. '32. chairman. Three.
students are now working for
Freihofer's baking company, two
at; the Central Y. M. ' A. and
several have been given jobs in
various parts of the city by Miss
Anna li. l’ierce. dean of women,
working’ in conjunction, with the
employment agency.

Several female students have also
been placed by the student-operated
agency. The (ireat Atlantic aml
l'aciiic tea company has hired
several of the wonn-n. and others
are working for private families in-
various capacities.

An attempt will he made by the
committee to determine. the linin-
her of students in the college who
hold part time positions and the
number desirous of obtaininicr such‘
employment This investigation
will be conducted with the coopera-
tiun of the Nirws, l)r.'insl<_v said.
The information thus secured will
he used in an clTort to lill any
vacancies which are found.

’l‘he committh has found a good
deal of difficulty in securing jobs
lit-caust- of the depression, l)ransky

hire students while local laborers
go unemployed. This condition
will be greatly relieved after New
Years, employers promise. Many
students should pct employment
during the Christmas vacation,
