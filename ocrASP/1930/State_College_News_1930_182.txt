STATE COLLEGE NEWS, FRIDAY, DECEMBER 19, 1930

Question: "Do you feel that the

value derived from noon-hour danc-
ing in the gymnasium is sufﬁcient
to oﬂ‘set any potential impairment
of scholastic progress which might
warrant the discontinuance of the
dancing?"
..Muriel Scott, '34: .“Yes. I think
it breaks up the monotony of class
room routitte. Also lots of fresh-
men have learned to dance because
of this pleasant feature of our col-
lege day,"

William Reagan, '33: “l'd say
this half hour of relaxation is really
needed to keep one's mind clear
for afternoon Classes,”

Wilhelmina Schneider, ‘31: “In
tny opinion, scholastic progress
could itot be impaired by a half-
hour period of leisure time during
which students are at will to enjoy
a bit of mental relaxation. Such is
the function of dancing iii the gym.
nasinm at noon and I believe it's
value is inestintablc."

Frances Gaynor, '32: “People
who would study during the noon—
liour probably never dance anyway.
However, a walk seems to me
much more enjoyable and refresh-
ing form of noon-hour relaxation."

Raymond Collins, ’31: “It would
be absurd to entertain the idea of
abolishing dancing iii the gymnas-
llllll for a reason of that sort, ’l'be
mntarts which are made there at-
ford untold mine to the individual
and certainly offset any possibility
of stholastit retardation."
