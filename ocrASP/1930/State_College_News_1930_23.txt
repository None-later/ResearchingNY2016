“Rivalry Not So Keen," Say Freshmen"

Say Sophomoresz-i '

-problcm of handling the freshmen
men for infractions ot‘ rules. ‘
I""l‘lie sophomores have been at a
disadvantage in reporting and cnforc- _
ing the rules, because the instruments
ot eitforcment have been practically
removed. The majority of the fresh-
men men have taken the matter in
the right spirit. It is the women of
the class who will have to be
watched," Rice said.

The sophomore-freshman rivalry‘
has not been so keen this first semes-
ter, 'l'liorley Dultnse, freshman presi-
deitt, believes. There have been at-
tempts by both classes to find their
.tppoiients' banners, but the searches
ltuve been unavailing. The class ban-
ners have been turned over to the
women attd will remain iii their pos-
session until Moving-Up day unless
they are mind by members of the
rival classes.

Over the Horizon

ERE they comc——rlic nucleus of an all-electric
merchant marine. Yesterday, they were a. dream.
Today, they are well over the horizon, linking the ports
of the east and west coasts with fortnightly service. The
goal of the Panama Paciﬁc Line is to build three more
turbine-electric ships, thus enabling weekly New York-

Frisco sailings.

Even now, the three, liners, California, Virginia, and
Porno/ninja, constitute the largest ﬂeet of turbine-electric
commercial ships in the world.

Besides propelling these ships, electricity hoists freight,
raises anchors, mans pumps, turns rudders, drives winches,
and warps the vessds into their berths. It lights lamps,
spins fans, Operates elevators, cools and cooks food. Its

magic touch is uppurm

it on every deck.

All electric. equi'pn'tcnr, above and below deck, is a prod-

Ltd? of General Electric

The planning, production, and distribution of such

equipment has been largely the responsibility of college-
