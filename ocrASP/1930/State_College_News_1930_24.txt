Interciau System Isn’t Good
Sayl Junior Member
or Commission

"As far as I haw.- observed, 1
would say that interclass rivalry is
not a very good system for keeping
the campus in order," Myrtle Kent-
field, '30, member of the campus com-
mission, declared today in comment-
ing upon the new rivalty system in-
augurated by this year’s ' '
Under the ucw plan, each member
of the commission. acting as a re-
presentative of his class, performs the
duties assigned to him in order to
set the best record for his class.

“The factors involved are too in-
deﬁnite to stimulate the classes to
competition," Miss Kentﬁeld believes.
Since freshmen work under a senior
chairman, and there is no speciﬁed
division of the different classes, inter—
class rivalty seems to be practically
non-existent," she thinks.

"The students have been co-operat-
ing quite well, although a few of
them persist in mistaking the locker
room for the cafeteria or annex,"
Edythe Cairns, '31, member of the
commission told the News.

The commision has general super-
vision in keeping the campus in order.
Members work under a co-operative
system, the chairman of one com-
mittee acting as assistant to the chair-
man of another.

A thorough inspection of the mail-
box is made once a week by Miss
Kentﬁcld and Beulah Nadler, both
seniors. Inspection of the mailbox is
also intermittently made by all mem-
bers of the commission. Notes less
than two inches in size are taken
from the box and destroyed.

' Freshmen Improving
Physically, Doctor Say:

"1n the last ten years there has
been a gradual but steady improve-
ment in the physical make—up of the
freshman class, according to Caroline
C. Croasdalc, college physician and
professor of hygiene.

“To compute the exact degree of
improvement would be too great a
task for this department to under-
ake at present, but [ can say with
certainty that the State college wo-
man of today is healthier than the
:turlcut of ten years ago."

“We base our judgment on the
'ihysical tests which each lrcshmzin is
ibljged to tnkc,” Dr. Croasdalc said.
“At present our plan is to divide the
‘Xitll‘lillillloll allowing credit for eyes,
teeth, posture, and general appear-
.n cc. By making the tests subjective
In this manner, it is easier for us to
hot-p a check on the health needs of
