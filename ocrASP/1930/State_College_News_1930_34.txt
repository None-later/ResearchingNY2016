I'Out om Student's
Sees Baseball Games

(Continued from page 1, column 3)
college prestige among other colleges.
Abolition of tiie sport might lead to
a movement to eliminate basketball,
the only other intercollegiate major
sport at State college, they argued.

Baseball’s defenders claimed that it
five percent of the new students were
interested in baseball, it would jus-
tify the expenditure of five percent
of the student association budget.
This was denied by some of the other
men, who said tllat this ﬁve percent
of the money was not being paid by
the interested men, but by the entire
association.

The question of a coaching,r class
was vetoed on the grounds of im-
practicability. It would require three
afternoons a week, and according to
one speaker, this time could better
be spent in education Classes, or
classes of his major subject. to fit
him for a teaching position.

The proposition of having a coach-
ing class besides a varsity baseball
team received favorable comment, but
was vetoed by Coach linker who
claimed that the strain of coaching
a baseball team would not allow him
to undertake the added burden of
conductng a coaching class.

After two hours of debate. a vote
was taken on the motion to eliminate
baseball. and was voted down, A
new motion was presented to “rt-coni-
mend to the student association that
baseball be retained in State college
as a major sport," but was declared
out of order by the chairman of the
meeting,r because it moved something
already in eiTeet.

A motion to appoint a committee

to investigate the athletic situation
in State college was lost when
speakers declared that the lixed

opinion of the chair might prevent
the appointment oi a l’t‘]!l’t‘!~l'llt:lll\'t'
committee

A motion to reconsider the orig-
inal motion to appoint a Committee
with the amendment that the appoint-
ments should be approved by the
assembly was lost when t‘oach Ilaltet'
declared that he would not care to
confer with the members of such a
committee. The meeting was then
adjourned.
