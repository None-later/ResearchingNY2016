OUT OF HIGH CHAIR

The recent action of Myslcania iii imposing a penalty
upon a violator t' College tradition»: has. in some in-
stances, been tlll pai'ngly run through the gantlct of stu-
dent criticism. The judicial body has sometimes been
charged as an indiscriminate court because it “meted out
' arbitrary punishment." Such opinion Comes from stu—
ttqutsnhucither know the constitution, or wltu are llll-
acqnai'nted with constitutional procedure. or who are
malicioust cainoullaging the facts. It is hoped that the
latter group exists only for purposes of classiﬁcation.

The charge that .\l_\s'kania in imposing penalties iii an

dent who knows the Constitution thoroughly. .\|, kania
IS merely acting as a court \\‘lllL'll hands out certain pen<

students, who compriw the legislative department under
the constitutional scheme, have themselves decided that
tradition» .»|tonld be observed. In addition. thry have

that “freshmen who ﬁnd only the front door of Draper

not climb the sill, they shall ask the janitor for the loan

Those who favor the scrapping of traditioits't‘nay
present their case with some amount of reason.
may rightfully claim that three of the traditions are
ylmply attempts to put the freshman itt lus high chair.
They may fairly argue tltat State college i.‘ aping a

oth itt bygone day probably thought that freshmen

look better iii caps tonnes. and buttons, and many are
.till applauding his brilliant idea. l‘erhaps many woult
till clap their hands if he had begun the custom of
'u‘aids and ribbons for women. and cropped hair for men.
An idea is baptized witlt the name of tradition, ant
