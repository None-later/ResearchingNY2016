Promotion Is Not Determined
By Copy Amount Only,
System Provldos

More than 2400 inches of news
and editorial material has been printed
in the STATE Comes News during
the ﬁrst ten issues, according to a
tabulation announced today by the
News board.

Louis J. Wolner, ’30, editor in
chief, leads in the total number of
published inches with 321 inches.
Alfred D Btiscli, '31, managing editor,
is second in the tabulation with 181
inches Of the non-board members,
r e P. Rice, ’32, desk editor, is
third with 117 inches, and Catherine
E. Broderick, '31, a junior associate
editor, is fourth with 92 inches.
Seventy-nine of the total inches pub-
lished have been submitted by cub
reporters. ‘

Promotions to higher stallf pos‘i-
tions, in the case of juniors and
under-classmen. will be based partly
upon the amount of inches to the
candidates' credit, according to the
traditional promotion system of the

cws. Other factors which will be
considered are the dependability of
the reporter in covering his ﬂsslglP
merits and the reporting of stories
on time. Promotion also depends
upon the quality of writing, unpub-
lished stories, and extra wor per-
formed by staff members, such as
copy reading, headline writing, and
clerical duties. _

The editorial department maintains
a record of uucxcusable failure of
reporters to cover assignments. Rec—
0rds of the quality of writing are
also made through the application of
objective standards.

The complete tabulation presented
below may not be strictly accurate,
the board explained, because some
reporters did not sign for stories
which they have written. The list
presents the accurate totals of all
stories signed ior, 'l'he tabulation

“DEPARTMENT HEAD

ASSUMES CONTROL
OF NEW ORCHESTRA

Dr. ’1‘. Frederick H. Candlyn, head
of the music department, has deﬁ-
nitely assumed charge of the orches-
tra, and he will continue to direct
and advise as long as interest is
shown by the members and the stu-
dent body, according to Frieda
Schadrinsky, ‘30.

“Although no deﬁnite program has
been mapped out, we plan to have the
orchestra play in assembly and at the
plays put on by the dramatics
classes," Miss Schadrinsky said.

At some future time, credit may be
given for playing in the orchestra
just as it is given for chorus work.
However this cannot be arranged
this year.

“The chief obstacle in the tray of
making this a regular credit course
is that it is practically impossible to
arrange a time at which all members

 

 

of the orchestra may be present for
practise," Dr. ('aiidlyn says.

Those who have signed up to play
iin the orchcstra are: violins, Frieda
iSrhadrinsky, '30, Winifred Ilnrlbtit,
i'BI, Theresa Wienecke, '32, Clayton
iStcwart, and Atlella Leimaii, fresh-
