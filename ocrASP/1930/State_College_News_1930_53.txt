VOICES OI" I3 MEN
TESTED TO FORM
CHORUS THIS YEAR

The voices of thirteen men have
already been tested iii the attempt
to form a men's chorus this year,
according to Dr. T. Frederick H.
Candlyn. instructor in music. "The
voices," he said. "were found to be
much better than formerly."

Considerable trouble has been ex—
perienced, according to Dr. Cand—
lyn, due to the conflict between
practice sessions and the education
2 class which is attended by sen-
iors. "Monday and Wednesday are
the only days of the week that
have time to give rehearsals to the
musical unit," he said. “Much will
be accomplished, however, by this
survey of the male voices for a
chorus for next year." Dr. Cand—
lyn hopes to haveotwo periods a
week deﬁnitely assigned on the
calendar to the men's chorus, with
a possibility of credit given for the
work by the college.

Several more candidates will take

 

the voice lr‘st before the work is
concluded for the year, according
to Dr. Candlyn.

'l‘lrose who have already had
their voices tested follow: Simon
Maslarr, Donald \Vlriston, and Ray-

Efforts of nearly ﬁfty freshmen
women to capture the sophomore
class banner at the Soiree Friday
night resulted in disappointment
and bruises for the freshmen‘ as
their rivals made a successful get-
away with the coveted banner.

The large yellow harnrer was
used as a decoration and was hung
in the Page hall gymnasium where
it was the object of vigilant obser-
vation by both freshmen and sop»
lromores. As the time for the last
dance drew near, the sophomore
women, headed by Virginia Haw-
kins and Asenath Van Buren, pre—
pared to make their exitr These
preparations aroused the interest
of the watchful freshmen who dev
scended into the back of the gym—
nasium to better observe the pre-
parations The, aid of two suit

and a large cardboard box was en—
listcd in order to deceive the yearl-
ings.

At the appointed time three bands
of sophomores burst from the ('ol-
lege each bearing a suspicious loolt-
irrg burden. Thc freshmen gave
chase but wcrc bewildered il.‘ to

Bruisos At Soiree:

Fule banner was safely removed
through the midst of the group
who felt it beneath their investiga~
tion and dismissed search of it
with the remark that it wasn't there
anyway.

'l‘hose bearing the banner en-
tered a car and started away but
were noticed by the freshmen who
immediately gave chase. The race
continued for about ﬁfteen ruin~
utes and ended when the car bear-
ing the banner doubled on the
freshmen who lost its track.

After the banner was safely
housed. the members of the class
who had been instrumental in get-
ting it away celebrated in a res-
taurant on Central avenue.
