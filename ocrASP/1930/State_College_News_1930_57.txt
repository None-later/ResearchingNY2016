ﬁrms CAPTURE
BASKETBALL mus
mom FRESHMEN

The juniors won the college in-
ter-class basketball championship
by defeating the freshman ﬁve
25-14 on the Page hall court Mon-
day night.

The freshmen were the ﬁrst to
score, Detlefson caging a one
handed toss over his head to put
his team in the lead. However,
Lyons, star of the juniors and also
high scorer of the game with.“
points, tallied from the penalty line.
Detlefson again succeeded in break-
ing through the defense to snore
two more paints.

 

Lyons then made two shots from
the ﬁfteen foot mark and later fol-
lowed this with one from the ﬁeld‘
giving the juniors the lead. Iii-
graham then made a ﬁeld goal, as
the freshmen attempted to regain
their advantage, but Kolodiiy scored
a be sket for the juniors, the score
standing 9-6 at the end of the initial
half, with the juniors in the lore.

The second half started fast with
the freshmen strivng to overcome
their handicap. Detlefson again
tallied for the yearlings, but Olt
made one for the third year men
and Kolodiiy duplicated his team-
inate's performance.

[ngraliam and [lush scored for
the freshmen, but the juniors could
not be stopped and both Ott and
Lyons succeeded in evading their
men and adding four points to
their teams total.

The teams were ﬁghting desper—
ately at this stage of the game, each
trying,r to imleash a withering at-
tack. lngrahani and De Laura both
caged the ball alter hard fought
scrimmage-5, blit Sclioor, Basch, and
Ott retaliated in rapid succession
for the juniors. To make his team’s
:ulvantage more decisive, Lyons
put one through the hoop.

'l'lie freshmen tried valiantly to
overtake their opponents but the
ﬁnal whistle put an end to their
rouraueons but ineliecttial attempt,
the score remaining 254i. with the
juniors in the i(tl’t'.

STATE COLLEGE NEWS, MARCH 28, 1930

 

State May Get Representation
In Heaven: With Nani Planet

Minerva, the patron goddess of
this College may be placed on
the astronomical map, if the
plans of the editor of the New
York Times are carried out. He
has made the happy suggestion
that Percival Lowell's newly re-
discovered “Planet X" be named
Minerva, the Goddess of inven-
tion, thought and intelligence,
and above all schoolmasters, and
students.

This may inaugurate our rep-
resentation iii the heavens. If
heavenly intervention should
prove more potent than earthly,
State college may still find that
it has obtained appropriations for
a school library and a fence.

Perhaps prayer meetings and
sacriﬁcial ﬁres will have more
beneﬁt in the attainment of these
ends than have student coni-
niittecs.
