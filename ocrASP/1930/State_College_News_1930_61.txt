Ability To Direct Activities ls Demand
Of Principals, Professor Sayles Says

“Ability to direct and supervise journalism, debating aiidpublic speali-

ing, and athletics are the

forms of extra-ciirr cular activity most in

demand by principals and superintendents when hiring teachers." Pro-
fessor John M. Sayles, principal of Milne High school and secretary
of the placement bureau, said today.

“Any man who has the ability to
direct such activities and at the
same time teach is more valuable
than one. who has not the necessary
knowledge to coach properly or di-
rect any other form of activity,"
rofessor Snyles declared. “Such
an ability always means the placing
of a premium on the services of
such a teacher," accordini.r to l’ro-
lessor Snyles.

Professor Sayle's statement is
based upon his experience in ﬁlling
the demands of the principals and
superintendents during his term as
secretary of the placement bureau.

The value of any teacher to a
school is enhanced by his ability to
take charge of extraucurricular ac-
tivities, Professor Sayles declared.
This is especially true of the smaller
schools which cannot afford to hire
an athletic. coach or an adviser to
publications or public speaking and
debate coaches.

Almost every high school has a
publication of some kind. It may
tie a newspaper, an annual, or a
literary IitngaZtite. Thus the super-
tnteudent is more likely to hire a
student who can assist in the direc-
tion of these activities

Approuunately twenty requests
are rem-wed by thr- hureau each
year tor students who can both
teach and coach athletic trams. At
the present timothcrc are four po-
sitions open awaiting the candidates
whit can both teach and roach.
l’ruli-ssor Sinlt-s said.

Milne High Speakers

Five State college women and
three men. all of the junior class,
have coached Milne High school
pup-its for their annual prize speak-
iitg contest which will be conducted
to-uighi at 8:15 o'clock in the au-
ditorium of Page hall.

The Milne High seltool students

who were assigned to the work as
part of their practice teaching
duties. The innovation this year
is to permit the juniors to become
acquainted with the pupils of Milne
High school before they begin to
teach, according to MiSs Katherine
E. Wheeling. supervisor of practice
teaching.

The juniors and the pupils they
are coaching are: Doris Tompkins,
