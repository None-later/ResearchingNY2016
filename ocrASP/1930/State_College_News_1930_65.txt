When Small Machines
Were Big

ORE than a quarter century ago,

the Commonwealth Edison Com-
pany, prophetically alive to the
immense possibilities of the future,
ordered from General Electric :1 5000-
kilowatt steam turbine—in those days
a giant of electric power.

To-day, a General Electric turbine-
gcncrator of 208,000-kilowatt capacity
sends out its vast energy to the Chicago
Metropolitan District.

l
than“ College-trained men played a respon-
‘. ’ all.” sible part in the engineering and
I . J an“, -
‘ IN   manufacture of both machines—lust

as they serve in important capacities
in the engineering, production, and
distribution of all General Electric
equipment, large or small.
