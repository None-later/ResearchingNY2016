cording to our plans.“

To date. the senior write-ups

Relatives Merits of Debaters Determined
By Ability. Not Sex, Mr. Bryant Believes

“I. would rather draw a horizon-
tal lnic separating the good women
and men debaters from the poor
debaters of both sexes rather than
draw a vertical line denoting the
relative merits of either sex in de-
bating." said Donald C. Bryant,
instructor in English. and assistant
(‘OﬂCIl' of the debate teams.

“in other ‘words." said Mr.
Bryant, "I think that there are
good men debaters and good

\miueu debaters."

“One advantage, I would concede
to the men is that by their attitude
and slﬂgt' presence they seem
better able to cover discrepancies
in their talks than women, The
masculine voice perhaps is a little
more impressive and effective than
most femiiiiiie ones."

“However. i have found that
women debaters are more apt to
be a little more rattled in their
preparation of the debate than the
men," Mr. liryaiit continued.
"They are more apt to be worried
over the outcome, although they
also seem more couscieiitious about
their work and a little more in
earnest. perhaps."

The State college debate teams.
both men's and women's, have had
an excellent record in that the
men's team has this year defeated

“I should like to see as much
debating in the college as those
interested in it can afford to spend
on it," Mr. Bryant said. “There
is no question as its value. since
anything which aids in clear speak-
ing and logical thinking is valuable
educationally."

“What I should like to see is a
debate between the men‘s: and
women's teams of State college.
said Mr. Bryant. “Such an experi-
ment has been successfully tried in
other colleges. One of the Vassar
Vomeu's teams recently defeated
a team representing Yale, so that
the outcome is not always so much
in favor of the men as it would
seem."

"Another thing," Mr. Bryant
said. “the power of women to talk
themselves deaf. dumb and blind,
avails them nothing in debating.
This is evident, and the quality of
their speeches shows this. be
relatively short period of the de-
bating heritage of women is more
responsible for any of their weak-
nesses as debaters than their sex."
