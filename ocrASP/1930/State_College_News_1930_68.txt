AEQSI‘ATE DANCE
. 10 BE APRIL 26,
JONES DECLARE

.Preparations for the next all-
State dance are being conducted,
and orchestra bids are being re-
ceived, according to Arthur Jones,
'31, who is in charge of the affair.
April 26 has been selected as the
tentative date for the event.

he dance is the second of its
kind ever to be conducted at State
college. it is novel in that it is
sponsored by no single organiza-
tion, but is the result of coopera-
tion on the part of all the men of
the college. No outsiders are
allowed to attend. In this respect
it, is quite unique, according to

Jones.

When the dance was conducted
for the ﬁrst time last semester, it
received the felicitations of Dean
Anna E. Pierce and other members
of' the faculty who attended. The
students who were there were also
enthusiastic over the novel dance.

The dance will be conducted in
the Lounge oi Richardson hall,
according to the committee. Sixty
couples, the number set by Dean
Pierce as maximum, are expected
to attend.

The price of bids will not exceed
$1.00, the committee believes. “
the number attend that we expect,”
Jones said, “the price will probably
be less."

,Thc committee in charge of the
dance consists of Jones, Russell
Ludlum, and Lawrence Newcomb,
juniors.
