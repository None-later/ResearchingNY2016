inspiring canyons of the Colorado
river which I visited on my way
home. and the wonderful beauty of
California are all indelibly stamped
upon my memory.

I heard a great many problems

I was able 1) explain several State
rolleg‘e institutions which they fell
might be advantageously adopted
into their i-ullegcs. I was pleased
to know that students of other in-
stitnions felt that some of our cus-
luins were worthy of adpotion into
their student life.
