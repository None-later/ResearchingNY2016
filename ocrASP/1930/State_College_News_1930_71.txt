“Change Divorce Laws.

" Debaters Sayz.

Present Statutes Are 100 Stringent

Divorce laws in New York state
are too stringent if the decision
given to the afﬁrmative team debat-
ing in the English 3| class con-
ducted by Dr. Harold W. Thomp-
son, professor in English. is any
indication. The question debated
was "Resolved, That New York
state shall grant divorce for incom-
palability,"

Arguing that incompatability is
a proper ground for divorce because
rwer-stringcnt divorce laws lead to
crime and are undemocratic, the
alTIrInative, composed of Andrey
()‘Raidy, ~.il, and Curliss Rnten-
)t‘l', '32, defeated the negative,
defended by Warren Cochrane. '30,
and Ward Cole. '3l,

The afﬁrmative further cou-
lt‘lltlt‘tl that marriage is a contract
and can he dissolved if such (lis-
~nltllinll is beneﬁcial to both con-
tractors, The marriage, contract,
they declared, \\'as purely a legal
lrlll‘ and um r-t‘clt'~i:islival prrjtldit‘es

an expensive trip to Reno can get
a divorce when their married life
is wrecked on the rock of tempera-
mental diﬁcrcnces. The laws of
New York are so stringent, she
said, that a woman whose husband
is convicted to life imprisonment,
cannot get a divorce from him.
Cochrane of the negative
countered by declaring that mar-
riage is fundamentally a religious
relationship. The sanctity of mar-
riage, he maintained. is one of the
fundamental doctrines of Christian-
ity, an the Bible declares that

‘inﬁdclity shall be the only ground

for divorce. (,ochrane said the true
solution for shipwrecked marriages
lay is more stringent marriage
laws; not a relaxing oi the divorce
laws. The first or second marital
adventures of a person should not
be made as a training for a ﬁnal
successnt marriage.

Cole. on the other hand, attacked
the aflirmative arguments by point-
im: out 'that marriage should not

In Impeachment Proceeding.

The shadow of prison bars lifted
from Earl Bloomingdale, ’51. when
the English 9b parliamentary prac-
tice, acting as a jury, declared him
innocent by a vote of 7 to 5 Tues-
day morning.

He had been impeached by the
class for conduct unbecoming a
gentleman and for neglect of duty
in the class. The trial lasted for
two meetings of the class.

It was his third trial in the
College in the past year, he hav~
ing twice been tried for murder in
government classes and acquitted.
