paign by defeating its opponents
tomorrow. thus starting its season
in an auspicious fashion.

We wotild appreciate it very much
if the undergrads of the college
woul turn out en inasse for to-
morrow's t‘OlllL‘sI, and give the team
deserved support.

That the men of the college want
a track team is evident. Tuesday
afternoon, as soon as the girls had
ﬁnished their jumping activities on
the back campus, several track en-
thusiasts immediately appeared and
tried out their ability at high jump-

transition of the news from the
time the event occurred until the
