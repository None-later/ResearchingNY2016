First Opposition in Tilt

At Ridgeﬁeld

The State college baseball team
will open its current season to-
morrow afternoon at 2:45 o'clock
at Ridgeﬁeld park against Hartwick
college of Oneonta.

The squad has been hampered
quite a bit by unfavorable weather
conditions although several prac-
ticcs have been conducted on the
home diamond.

“Prospects for a successful sea.-
son are bright," said Coach Ruther-
ford R. linker. "The hittini: power
of this year's team will not equal
that of last year." he continued,
"but our defense will be just as
strong, if not stronger."

The Purple and ﬂuids opponent
to-inoi'row is reported as having :1
very capable pitcher, but in the
opinion of this writei, Len Allan,
hurler for State, for the
seasons, will be more!
