“The orcltestra may continue under

Schadriitsky said. The leader has not

Theft ls Only Extreme Cat:
or Vandalism. Avers
Dr. Brubacher

 

'l‘wn suitcases were stolen from the
dressing room of Milne High SChOOl
during a recent game by two boys
who had entered the building without
permission. The suitcases were re—
covcred when the boys were identiﬁed
by a Milne lligh school student.
The boys were itot prosecuted. and
their names were withheld by the au~
thnrities. One is the son OT a pr0<
mittent Alhany attorney. Both are
Albany High school pupils.

The theft was only an extreme
case of many acts of vandalism and
annoyance by outsiders. according to
President A. R. llruliaclicr. During
('ollege dances, there has always been
a'gallery of watchers iii the windows

httt they returned again. They had

Conduct of this kind and other ob-

come to dances without invitation
hare impressed the College with the
need of keeping outsiders from Col—
lege functions, but there is no means
of enforcing any such ruling at pres-
ent. llr. Bruhacher explained. It is
helievol that the building of a fence
around the campus would eliminate
llltrst, if not all, of these evils.

:\ committee of students may visit
the State legislature during the pres—
ent session to ask for an appropria-
tion for such a fence. This fence
