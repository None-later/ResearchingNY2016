STATE COLLEGE NEWS, MAY 2:} 1930

 

SPORT SHORTS

By AL SCHOOR

The boys came back to the win-
ning column in the Hamilton game
with a hang. The team gave Allan
good support and it was a well
earned victory.

The biggest turn-out of the year
was at this game, which happened
to he the best of the season. A
little organized cheering under the
direction of Clay Stewart. helped
the team quite a bit in its stubborn
light.

DeLaura made a spectacular onc-
handed catch of Crowley's fast zipp-
ing liner in the ninth inning which
Goodrich also
made a clever pick-up of a had
throw to ﬁrst, with a man on third.
If he hadn’t stopped the ball, It
would have caused State's defeat.

Blunt started oil the initial inning
by getting a sale hit in his ﬁrst time
at the bat. He had also hit safely
when pttt iii the line—up as a pinch
hitter last week.

Kinsella came out of his batting
slump at opportune times. He
scored State's ﬁrst run on a whist-
ling drive to the outﬁeld.

Lawton was the only member of
the team to touch Allan's offerings
more than once, getting it double
and a single.

The boys leave for Onconta to-
morrow to meet the Hartwick team
in a return encounter, and although
inclement weather has prevented
any real work-outs this week, it
looks as if the Purple and Gold
wearers will return with another
victory.

The t-atn should be proud of the
Hamilton win as the Buff and Blue
has defeated R. I’. University
of Rochester and St. Lawrence uni-
versity in its last three contents.
