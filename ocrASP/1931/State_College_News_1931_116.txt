LIBRARY FIGHT OVER

The announcement that \\ttl'l( will start on the

conic one to the students oi this (allege. 'l‘liey

have gone through the discotiifort of working iii a
library utterly inadequate to permit even a small
part of the student population to work in comfort.
They have gone to the length of Iiiaking sonal

legislature and the fin: tt‘t' committee during the

ipport of l'i'es’irlent llrnbaclier (lid not
waver during the long period of waiting that seemed
to be necessary.

\\"hcn the new library opens in March the students
will realize that new opportunities opened to
them in the form of vastly better fatilities and int-
proved service. Miss L'obb and her asistants have
performed a diflicult task iii tine fashion when they
served student needs iii the old quarters. Now they

A WISE POLICY
Agitation for I'eoreaiiiztition of the l‘t'tlagopuc

staff, lead by the Slit/e Calla/e .Vrier last year. has
culminated in the adoption of valuable improvements
by the yearbook slitll and the senior class.

The antiquated and tinbns’i-n-sslike procedure of
electing the editors and business managers by popu-
lai‘ vote has been relegated to the shelves where it
should have been collecting dust years ago. The
new board will be selfrperpetuating. 'l'hat is, tllt'tll-
hers of the ontgoini,I board will elect the'r sut‘t't's-
sors, following the example of all other ('ollege
publications. 'l‘hi: advantages of this are fairly obv
vious, chief among them being that the best qnali»
fietl people st'lt‘l‘l successors whose work is' a guar~
antce of the next year's success.

’l‘lic board will also allow sophoiiiort's' and juniors
to try out, This too, l\ ati unquestioned improve
ineiit. The longer these pt-nplt' contacts and
tqiportitnities for perfecting theIiist-lvt's for duties
they will prt siIniably undertake, the better they will
bi: prepai't-t

The 193.! l’i'tltigogttl' staff is to ltt' t'oiiqu-iitlvtl for
its widerawakt' attitude, It has adopted it polit\
that cannot fail In beneficial results

(lite of the most stirringr aiul fascinatingr .storits in
literature steps across the pages of history in this mas
sive and vital iunel, rich in background and ctitil‘ttloltsl}
rich in the portrayal of one of the most fascinating
characters ('\t't‘ born in the mind of a writer.

Rogue Ilt-rries‘, the haughty, weuching, \agxibond
gentleman hero, is a completely rounded character who
is as masterly portrayed as is the lingland which nour»
ished him. l’icturc, if you can. a scene iii a public
tavern in which llcrri partially drunk. :tltrtiotts off his'
mistress for thirty piec-s of silver. llt-spitc these fre-
quent lapses, llerries did have idealsiidt'als that sent
hint reeling and carousing‘ through a world of realities
in search of something that seemed unattainable for
him. Yet he could treat the mother of his sons with
a brutal callousness and a barbaric lat k of respect.

err ,. lives with a robust reality that impinges the
story of his great and almost obsessive love for his
second wife, .\lirabcll, upon the brains of her readers.
She, together with his faithful sei'\ant, lenjamin, fol—
lowed him to the secluion of his stony wilderness es—
tate at llerries. Their relationship was a peculiar one
—slie marrying him with the common imderstandiug
that their union ' prompted more by her poierty
than by llL‘t' liking for ltim. Yet she grew to loie him
more and more ; ' they lived together. Once she left
him and then we have the episode of the lonely old
man, for he was then growing old, trudging up and
down lingland to recover the woman whose complete
love he hatl determined to win.
nally he found her. Bringing her back to llerries
and its lonely 'tmosphere, be again took up his pathetic
attempt to gain her love. llis worship of her trans-
cended t 'en the deep understanding which \isted be‘
tween his son lta\itl atid liimSclt. llis worship of her
was oddly itnnitlt-Ilmshe was not an educated woman,
was most unskilll‘ul about the house, no one could call
her beautiful, and she was not strictly a lady in the
ordinary connotation of that Word.

'l‘hroughtint the story we einision lltl‘ changing con-
ceptions of llerries'iiti his powerful and magnetic
youth. llerries standing stripped on a cold aniitmn
morning waiting to be doused with water by Benjamin,
llerries riding his fine charger, Heroes dawdling in
alt-lions s with tau-rn wcnches, llei'rics shouting in
stentoi-iaii tones for his dinner.

\Valpolr makes the rollicking eighteenth century li\e
again \\llll its‘ \vitt'ht's', gloomy old houses, l’ttlslt'l'ltl:
blades, and its romance. lle ias ably succeeded in
portraying eighteenth century l‘ilIKlillltl in luileidoscopiv
fashion, giving authentic \iews' of the many lewls of
society that combined to produce the nation that fought
for and against the j:ittiliitis and the Young l't‘l‘ll'tttlt‘t'.

for more space.
