' SUMMER SCHOOL

SETS NEW RECORD
F OR ATTENDANCE

The registration of students in the
19.3] eded the enrollment in regu-
lar s , )II by approximately two
hundred, according to llr. Milton G.
Nelson. director of the summer ses-
sion. The total number enrolled was
thirteen hundred and forty—seven in-
cluding one hundred and thirty-eight
State college undergraduates.

Dr. Nelson says of the increase:
"The influx this summer is typical

fessioiially'. and the teachers them«
selves are feeling the need for modern
training in the methods and content of
the subjects they are teaching. In in—
creasini,r numhers, ttachcrs of ex—
perience are being urged to attend
summer school at least every fourth
