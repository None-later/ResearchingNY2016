Symposium Of Merﬁbers Ofa 1931 Shows

Minerva adjuster] her spectacles.
arranged the hair under her helmet.
and gazed at us for a moment.

“You are now enjoying the host
four years of your life." The God-
dess sighed reminiscently like an old
alumnus and (lreaniily watched the iii-
cense we had burned to gain lier
avor.

“lint which of the four years is the
hest,” we demanded with the search-
ing eagerness characteristic of college
undergraduates.

Minerva smiled with just enough
subtle . dness to give us the impres-
sion oi saintly tolerance and replied.
“All things that the (iods grant are
good."

We weren't quite sure what that
had to (hr with it lint we dared not
ilah‘ more. and so we thande the old
lady and nn-ekly took our leave. For
a time we were without a course.
Finally we decided to ask some of the
seniors to rnminnnicate their opinions
eont'ei‘ning' the most pleasurahle year

   

Year As Best,

the senior year provides the most
enjoyment. "It is then that onogets
to really now his classmates. Before
the senior year a person doesn’t know
whether to speak to another student
or not."
Alfred l'). Bascli, '31. editor in chief
the Lion, was our next victim.
"The four years of college have
seemed to me like a single period
rather than four independent ones.
lint I believe that if everything comes
out right the last part of the junior
year is the best. There are other en-
joyable periods. but I have no doubt
but that that is the best."

In the opinion of Mabel Gilmaii, '31,
art editor of the lielio, the ﬁrst two
years of rollege are extremely boring.
“Only the junior and senior years are
good ones." she claims. “One really
gets to know people then."

\\'alter Driscnll. '31, a meinher of
Myshaiiia favors the junior year.
"Friendships that are only expel"-
nients before then heroine realities.
