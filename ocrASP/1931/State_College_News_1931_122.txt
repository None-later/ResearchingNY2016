STATE COLLEGE NEWS, FRIDAY, OCTOBER 9, 1931

 

l934,_NlNE DOWNS
FRESHMEN BY 23-1

Brooks, 'Varsity Moundsman,
Holds Rival Bats
Powerless

By KENNETH MILLER, ’32.
‘i-onrs EDITOR

Behind the strong right arm of
“Ossy” Brooks the sophomores ilc-
molished the freshmen nine 23 to
in the intramural baseball game
Saturday afternoon at Beaverwyck
park. Brooks, regular varsity hlirler.
was in his usual ﬁne form and
breezed along easily during;r the elltire
game. He was never in danger.

Brooks was not ill a generous
frame of miiid and gave away hilt
three hits duringr the contest. ‘ e
freshman hurlei's were in rather a
philanthropic mood and allowed some
thirty-ﬁve hits. _

Don Benedict. State’s leading.r slug-
ger who batted .545 as a member of
the varsity nine last spring, starred at
bat with a triple. a double, and two
singles. Most of his team-mates
made two or three hits off their
freshman opponents.

Torpcy, former lliughamton l'lieh
player started on the mound for ' '
but was later replaced by Jones. The
\‘i’illlllll_‘ line-up included Saunders.

solve all the friendships and ties that
were formed during college. 13 up—
perclassmcu organized what later de-
veloped into the Edward Eldred l‘ot-<
ter chib.

The group held together informal-
ly for some time, until Walter Dris-
coll. ’31, urged that a more deﬁnite
organization he formed. A meeting
alld dinner was conducted at the
home of Kenneth A. Miller. ’32, and
deﬁnite plans were begun. The mom-
hers rejected the idea of a Greek
letter fraternity. and decided that a
(llll) carrying a deﬁnite insignia he
formed under the name of t
Statesnlen. and membership be
limited only to men not belonging to
any social fraternity at State college.
The organization was to have as its
aims, ﬁrst a closer bond between
students and graduates. second, a
professional relationship between
irradnates to succeed the friendships
of college. and ﬁnally to raise the
social standards at State college.
This last aim meant that the mem—
bers will try to make visiting debate
teams or basketball tennis feel at
home at State.

There as to be no rushing. New
members were to be added as the
present members made new friend»
ships. lil short members were not
to he sought after: they \ri-re to be
friends. This meant that freshmen
wollld ilot be members very likely
