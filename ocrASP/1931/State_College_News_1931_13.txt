IIAnAnn GAME
WILL BE in non

Team to Mezt Leading Baaketeers
of Eastern Courts in Game
in Page Gymnasium

When the State college quintet
meets the Manhattan college squad
on Friday night, February 6, in the
gymnasium of Page hall, the varsity
will encounter the leading basketball
team of the east and will encounter
the strongest team that representa-
tives of this College have met since
the Dartmouth game in 1927. The
Manhattan basketeers remain undc«
feated this year with eleven victories
gained during the season.

The Green and White machine has
gone through its schedule in impres-
sive fashion, defeating some of the
foremost college teams of the east.
They hold victories over Niagara,
City College of New York, New
York university, Carnegie Tech, Vil-
lanova and Rensselaer Polytechnic In—
stitute.

The visiting squad has several ex-
perienced letter men available for
active duty whom they will use in
State college game. I
have Dan Kelleger, as its most Im~
pressive star, with his mate at for-
ward, Mitchell, both of whom have
tallied the highest scores. The rest
of the lineup includes Keegan, at cen—
ter, and Leonard and McManus at
the guard positions.

The State college lineup will prob-
ably be chosen from the followmg
men: captain Frank Ott, and Charles
Lyons, seniors, Gilbert DeLaura, Ben
Ingraham, and john Detlefson, sopho-
mores, and Roger Bancroft, Thomas
(Jarrett, Osmcr Brooks, and Jack
Saunders, freshmen.

III the basketball season of 1920
State college completely outplayed
Manhattan college when it displayed
a brand of basketball which not only
bullied its opponents, but also was a
marvel to their supporters. It is
hoped by .Coach Rutherford Baker
that this brilliant victory of 04-5 may
be duplicated in the coming game.
He has subjected his players to m-
tensive and strenuous workouts since
their return from the Christmas re-
cess in order to round them into con-
dition for the game and has succeeded
in instilling a great deal of spirit and
co-operation among them. .

Critics who expect a decisive VlC'
tory for the visitors may receive a
great surprise by the ﬁghting spirit
the Purple and Gold will display.

STUDENTS ATTEND TEA

The members of the art apprecia-
tion class and the history of art
class attended a tea last Friday at
the home of Mrs. William Bayard
Van chssclacr on State street.
There they were shown a moving-
picture on the making of a bronze
statue, which presented all thc steps
from the Cumplirliml of the clay
model to the finished product.

Miss Eunice l‘erine, head of the
art department, was in charge of
the group.

THOUGHTS OF JUNIORS FOR PROM

It's the last of the ﬁrst of the months of the year,—
Tea Dance and Prom and Luncheon are, here;
All jumbled and hectic with ﬁnals and rushing
And the need to be girlish and bashful and gushingl
For the skirts, they are long,
And the hair looks demure,
And the old-fashioned girl
Is the Prom Queen for sure!

I’ve written for money to Dad and to Mother

This paying the way Is it

I’ve added, subtracted, divided the cost—-
But still my account is an absolute lost.
Five ﬁfty for Prom,
Two dollars for Lunch,
One ﬁfty for Tea—
Nine bucks in a bunchl

I've looked at the dresses, the wraps and the slippers,
At Lerncr's and Hadrian's and the “Two Sisters";
l've liaggled and argued and begged for a price

could cover without stretching twice.

A ten gown for Tea,

An outﬁt for Luncheon,—

The despair of my soul is the man I must take,
He's a clown and a bore and an absolute rake.
I asked him last Fall when men were more rare:
But the tricks of the Fates are ghastly unfair :—
For listen to this——
Last week I met
An R. P. I. lie-man
Who'd come on a bet

 

The State college varsity basket—
ball team is scheduled to meet the
Manhattan college team during the
next semester. The Manhattan team

is the undefeated intercollegiate
champions for the Eastern league
this season. They expect to have
300 rootcrs with the team.

Question: What do you think of
having the game with the Manhat-
tan college played on the New
York State Armory court on the
corner of Lark and Washington
avenue?

Coach Rutherford Baker: “The
game against the Manhattan col—
lege is strictly a State college game
and should be played on the State
college court. True, the gymnas-
ium is not big enough to seat the
crowd that is expected to conic.
but there is always room under—

 

The fact that all evening dresses
will be touching the ﬂoor at Prom
tonight is not a new idea, but the
predominance of contrasting color ef-
fects is decidedly one. The use of
contrasting colors, in evening gowns
especially, is a radical change from
the past when they have carried out
the ensemble idea of having every-
thing in shades or tints of the same
color, Mrs. Anna K. Barsam, assistant
professor of home economics, said.

This latest style is best effected by
an evening dress with a contrasting
sash and bow hanging from the high
waist clear to the floor. However, it
may take the form of slippers in con—
trasting colors, or of flowers, or rib-
bons. The [lowch are worn on the
shoulder and may match the slippers,
while the ribbons are made into gir-
dles which hang from the waist at' the
side.

The most popular color combina-
tions employ the pastel tones which
may be used in contrasts of she]
pink and powder blue, or maize yel-
low and green. Black and white
are, of course, always well repre-
sented. These colors are used best
in nets, which may be embroidered,
or in cliiﬁ‘ons. In addition to the
pastel tones, prints in vivid colors are
especially strong this season. These
are usually made up in stiff crcpcs.

The silhouette ﬁts the ﬁgure rather

of a bother 1

Heath the balconies and on the
balcony."
Harold H. Haswell, ’32, manager
of basketball: “The armory woul
be advisable if State college stu-
dents did not come to the game
for dancing that might follow. It
would be hard to dance on the
floor of the armory because of dif-
liculty in hearing the band."
harles Lyons, '31, captain of
the. team: "The only thing that
would prevent us from playing

 

the game in the armory. Supple-
mentary to that \Vuulll be the case
with which State college students
could render their cheers. it would
be very uncomfortable to cheer
while standing and also very un-
comfortable to watch the progress
of the game."

 

Prom Styles To Feature Contrasting
Color Effects. Mrs. Barsam Declares

closely and there is no longer any '
question as to the waistline. It is
where nature intended it to be. The
silhouette is bell-shaped, ﬁtting tightly
to the waist or knees and then falling
straight to the floor. If the skirt
hangs front the waist, the dress goes
still farther back into the past and
assumes drop shoulders, or, at least,
some perky little cap sleeves which
give the same effect.

There are also some rather unusual

cowl effects in the new evening gowns,
more particularly in the déeolleté
Jack.
The latest thing in jewelry is the
use of jewellcd clips which may be
worn at the neckline of one's evening
gown, and which are matched by
smaller ones fastened on the outside
of the evening slipper. Otherwise,
bracelets and rings are much stronger
this year than necklaces, which have
been greatly in vogue. The place of
the necklace may be taken by the
jewellcd clips.

Coiﬁurcs are all smooth, giving the
effect of long hair from the front
view. If desired, a jewellcd clip may
be worn in the left side of the hair.

Straight white kid gloves should
be worn by the majority, as those
gathered between the elbow and the

 

wrist are not yet assured. Lace
mitts \Vlll also he Worn.
Alvina Lewis, '33: “Since the

basketball games are supposed to
be for the entertainment of the
State college students, 1 feel that
the game should take place in the
Page hall gymnasium. A good
crowd will certainly be in attend-
ance, but I fcel that provision can
be made to allow all of them to
witness the game,"

 

Manhattan on the court which they

 

had suggested is the fact that it
costs tun much to hire the armory.
()nt of courtesy for their request,
however, I believe that the game
could be played there providing
the cost was not so great. “ll:
Manhattan team expects a strong
cheering section and it could be
more easily ‘acconnnndatcd in a
