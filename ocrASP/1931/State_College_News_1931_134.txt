Christopher Morley Praim
Co-Op In Literary Magazine

Christopher Morley, who will
give a lecture here 'l‘linrsday
night, praised the State college
Co~op in an article in the Satur-
day Review of Literature, dath
April, 193i.

"The tenth anniversary of the
Co-op, one of the foremost book-
stores in the country, illustrates
the tact that there never has
been and never will be any
slump in the educational book
business,” Morley said.

He emphasized the commen-
dation written by Professor
Richmond H, Kirtlatid, oi the
education department, in the
booklet commemorating the, an-
niversary of the bookstore. The
quotation is, “Two minutes there
always reminds one of the good
things he once meant to write
and of the better things he still
means to read."
