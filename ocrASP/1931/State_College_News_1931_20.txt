It is hard to look at hot 'l‘lntrwlay. liridqty. and Satnrr‘
day with a balanced viewpoint, Thch can be little doubt

iii any one's mind that such a program as \rc went
through last week—end MUST not be repeated. It is oh-

vious that the Ilaws in the new sorority rushing system
far outweigh its advantages.

Junior week-end itself is a wearing event, btit whcn
rushing is added to it, human nature or, perhaps. good
nature can stand no more. The average program of the
sorority girl was too crowded. And. after all. health 15
important, you know. The new system may be less cw
pensive in money. but its cost in rest, energy, and dis-
position is too overwhelming.

There is no question of going back to the old system
Reforms must be made in that. but not such Its we have
had, "Too concentrated and artificial a system" is the
verdict of many of the students. Although the sorority
members are supposed to abide by very strict non~rtish
rules during all of the ﬁrst semester. nevertheless they
are also expected to become so well acquainted with the
freshmen that the parties of rushing are only reunions of
friends. llns is impossible without breaking rules.

'1 he total number ol rushing rules comprise a inch
nine hours. ’1 Wu of those hours are consumed in break-
fast \\'llll'll follows one of the largest dances in the (fol-
