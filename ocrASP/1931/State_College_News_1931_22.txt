By Al. SCIIOOR

One of the largest crowds of the
year will jam its way into the gym
to witness the contest tonight and
they are goingr to see a'wonderful
court struggle in our opinion.

This contest reminds us of the
time State played the Dartmouth

and the team certainly handled it-l
self in commendable fashion al-
though failing to win due to a lackl
of strong reserve material.

Dick (ficolella. one of the stars:

the sample.

Rings of several companies were
secured, and all had been eliminated
except the samples of the \Varrcn—
Kalisc company and the Gleason—
Wallace company. The \iVarren-
Kahse ring was a plain one with

company was more ornate and bore
the mascot found by the juniors in
their freshman year.

These two rings were submitted
by the committee for the vote with-
out the formality of olfering them
to Myskania for inspection. The
vote progressed for several days,
the results showing that the \Var-
ren-Kahse sample was most popu-
lar. The committee was at that
time informed that the rings would
have to be submitted to Myskania
and that all the votes cast were
void.
