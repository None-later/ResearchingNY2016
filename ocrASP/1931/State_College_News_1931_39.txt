ATTEND l'l.\.\lll.TO.\' DEBATE

The student association will have an opportunity to
vindicate itself for the poor attendance at recent debates
by attending one or more of the contests which the (le-
hate council has scheduled for the coming weeks.

h'londay night the men’s team will engage L'iiion col-
lege in their second meeting over the radio. The follow-
ing night the team will meet Hamilton college in the

Page hall auditorium On Thursday, March 1‘). the
women will meet Reuka college in the Page hall audi-
torium.

It is a schedule that provides for some interesting
meetings. The women should be interested to learn why
the men oppose or defend their emergence from the home.
But they should have a stronger motive than curiosity
to impel them to attend the debates. They should have
sufﬁcient school pride to cause them to desire visiting
teams to carry home good impressions of the interest
of the students in activities that strengthen intercollegiate
bonds. This does not mean that the nicii should be con-
spicuous by their absence. Pride as well interest
should impel them to form part of the audience.

The attendance at the last meeting between State and
Middlcbury colleges was disgraceful. Some students have
felt that the fault lay with the debate council and have
alleged that the debate was given insufﬁcient ])tll)lit:ll.’
The same charge will not apply a .‘ -coiid timc. Postc
have been made and advance notices in College and city
papers have been made known the time and place to
students.

The fact that the men are debating the same subject
twice should not deter attendance. They will meet (lif-
fercnt types of men in each debate and in each, new
arguments will necessarily be brought out. Nor can
the excuse that the debate will be heard over the radio
apply in this case. Few sorority houses boast of a radio
and few students will care to sit Lip late enough to hear
the broadcast.

just made the acquaintance of King .\rthur and his
court—our eyes are shining just as brightly and our
dreams just as vain!

As Mr. Lynch sinus it up:

“lit the thirty years ending with thc dcthriiiicmcnt
of Tweed, and the overthrow of the Ring, Ne
York was in the hands of cni'riiptimiists. The coun-
try as a whole fared but little better. Honest millions
toiled in complete ignorance of the wrongs inflicted
upon them by their chosen servants. The minority
o the mass scnscil what was going on. Thcsr
grumbled to themselves and then lapscil back into
their natural apathy. Democracy had not changed
human nature.
