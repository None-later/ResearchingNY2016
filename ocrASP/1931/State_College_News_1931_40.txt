“My wish for you as teachers is
that you will start in a small town
for there you will he aide to study
and learn real human nature." Ur.
Welles said, He cited the character—
istics of curiosity and love of romance
:is the strongest motives upon which
ill teachers can play. in this con—
nt'ctiiut. he mentioned the fact that all
~ople are reformers by nature.

The leadership which conmmnities
tilll demand of all teachers, Dr.
Welles helieu'es, should he in With-
