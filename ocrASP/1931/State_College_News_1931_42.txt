Difficulties To

The pledges of Gamma chapter
of Kappa Delta Rho fraternity had
a difﬁcult time during the last week
in their endeavors to obey the rules
laid down for neophytes and at the
same time to discharge eotirteously
their social obligations. i

no of the rules for pledges pro-l'
liibited speaking to any women of,
the college. except in the presencel
of an iipper classman. They were!
also forbidden to speak to each:
other. ‘

They had to wash the dishes at
the fraternity house Sunday night
and had to address all full members
of the fraternity by the title of
"Mr." They had to be at the fra-
ternlty house a half hour every (lay.
They were also forbidden to dance
in the gymnasium.

In addition to learning the fra—
ternity songs, they had to memorize
the nam ' of all the t iptcrs, their
locatiu and colleges.

l'erlttlps the most useful accom-
plishment they ~bieved during the
pledge period was the learning of

 

 

 

 

Kappa Delta Rho Neophytes Undergo

Obey Fraternity Rules
the name, locations, and telephone
numbers of all State college sor~
orities.

Upperclass members of the fra-
ternin were very busy duringr the
pledge period checking violation of
these rules. Every infraction meant
the infliction of some penalty which
had been left to the imagination of
the pledges.

Every command of the upper
class members had to be obeyed
by the pledges, save those of a
dishonorable nature, according to
the rules.

The pledge period ended VVed-
nesday night with an informal inia-
tion at the fraternity house at 480
Morris streett Those who will be
taken into full membership in a few
weeks are: Charles Lyons, '31, John
(irosvenor. William Regan, Frank
Macliarlantl, and Raymond Harris,
sophomores, and Roger Bancroft,
Jack Saunders, I‘liillip Riceiardi,
William Nelson. George lietcbam.
and William Rogers, freshmen.
