Question: “What means would

you suggest to be used to increase
attendance at: the debates?”

Alfred D. Ranch, ’31: Clever ad-
vertising such as is bcing used for
the coming Hamilton and Union
debates would certainly help, and
a tried and true method of having
dancing after the debates would
make each of them a slam bang
success, tlic slam bang beini,r fur-
iiishcd by the doors ociiiiii,r and
closing during the last spccch by
the same group of people who
usually come for the last s ct
and the first note of dance mi c.

Walter Driscoll, '31: [Ii the first
place the dcbztes should be given
plenty of pnblicttv in the NIH and
it. they are going to use posters, get
thcm at least .50 hours hcforc the
debate—24 hours is hardly sufficient.
livcn if iiIOSc mciiibcrs of the coun-
cil who live in group linuscs said
somcthing about tlic dchatc. the at-
tL‘lll'lllCL‘ would be lar' cr than llhl
\i't-c'.

Edith James. '31: Hire the dc-
lmtcs more publicity to aronsc oni
iutcrcst. \\'c ought to lHH't' Iiiorc
intcrcst in tliing~ likc that. ;\ll
we are iiitcrcstcrl in now is IiIislo-t-
ball and dancing.

Mildred Quick, ’33: licttt'r :it-
tcmlancc at dcliatcs can l)L‘ obtaincd
through a Illl\'t‘l iiicaiis of
list-iiicnt. litlSh‘CllHlli tcaiih :ii'i-

should i'ci't'ivc recognition for lilt'
drliatini: tcaiii which wins il \‘iklih|’_\
for State is just as important as
the athli'ic train.

Lawrence Newcomb, ’31: 'l'Iiri-i'

datc itself. for di-batc l~ thc oiili
iiiti-rcollcgiatc activity in which
