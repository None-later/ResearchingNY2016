The Navajo Indians and their ex-
hibits, which will be brought to State
college by the dramatics and art
council irom May 5 to 9 will be ac—
cmiipanicd by a citizen of Vermont.
His name is Berton I. Staples, and

he will interpret the Navajo race to '

came a member oi the tribe. The
Indians will exhibit their skill in arts
and indicate religious beliefs in the
gymnasium of Page hall, according to
Ruth Hughes, '31. president oi the
council.

The names of the Indians that Mr.
‘taples brings to Albany are Haskc«

between two wars," who is a medicine
man and a sand painter; l)a-I’ah,
meaning “A lirave," who is a silver-
smith; aml Ye-ne—bah. meaning
“peace, or her mother had to settle
two disputes." who is a wearer.

the nephew ot' Manuelito, the last
elective our chief of the tribe. and
one of the signers oi the peace treaty
between the L'nited St 5 government
and the Navajo India in 1808. At
that time Manuelito said that his word
was enouin and refused to put his X

their coiice is too hot, and yet they
are a hrilliatit people," Mr. Staples
said.

He continued to explain their relig-
ion and their language, saying that
religious worship is beautiful.
“They have a Great Spirit who sends
things to them. Mother Earth
holds the seed of corn, and Father
Sky sends the rain and sun to make
it grow," Mr. Staples explained. "The
son of the Great Spirit came to the
earth and taught them all they know
and that is their religion." he added.

The language has a vocabulary 0
40,000 words. They have 1,064 ways
of saying “give,” and in their whole
vocabulary there is no expression oi
profanity.

paints the ligure oi the "Sun God."
Thc painting is done from liast to
