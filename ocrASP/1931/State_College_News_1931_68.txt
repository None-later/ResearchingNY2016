WRITENG
i'iERE/S
MADE
EASY!

 

A Carter Pen is a treat to
the eyes, but the real satis-
faction eomes when you start
to write. Gently the ﬁngers
guide the smooth, ﬂexible
point which responds imme-
diately to your particular
style of handwriting. An
enduring nib of long wear-
ing osmiridium prevents ﬁn-
ger fatigue — assures easy,
futigue~free writing. Built
into the cap of the Carter
Pen is the Rocker Spring
Clip released by a slight ﬁn-
ger pressure. The pen slip:
from the pocket without
pulling, jamming, or wear
and tear.
