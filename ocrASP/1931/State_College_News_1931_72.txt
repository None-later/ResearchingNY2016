WRITING
HERE’S
MADE

EASY!

 
 

A Carter on is a treat to
the eyes, but the real satis-
faction comes when you start
to write. Gently the ﬁngers
guide the smooth, ﬂexible
point which responds imme~
dietely to your particular
style of handwriting. An
enduring nil) of long wear-
ing ouniiridium prevents ﬁn-
ger fatigue —— assures easy,
fatigue-free writing. Built
into the cap of the Carter
I’eu is the Rocker Spring
Clip releabed 'by a slight ﬁn-
ger preaaurc. The pen clips
from the pocket without
pulling, jamming, or wear
and tear.
