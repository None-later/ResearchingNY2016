French ’29, Discusses
Journalism In Article

Courses in journalism oﬂ‘er educa-
tional advantages not offered by any
other department in the curriculum,
William M. French, ’29, director of
public relations in the public schools
of Grosse Point, Michigan. and asso-
ciate editor of the School Press Re-
view, declared in the April number
of the State college Alumni Quar-

rly.

French believes that there is a
growing interest in journalism in the
schools due to the realization by
school administrators that the school
paper can he an asset to the school
system; proof that the proper sort of
advertising in the school paper pays;
realization by teachers of English that
motivated writing brings better results
than compulsory themes, and the more
recent attempt to do away with the
elaborate school annual.

French teaches two classes in jour-
nalism at Grosse Point. The elemen—
tary class, for which high school
credit is given, has as its objectives
the gathering and writing of 'news as

practical English work, certain voca- ,

tional aspects of journalism. aiid an
understanding of newspapers and
agazines.

The advance course. also carrying
credit, is more informal, and is con-
ducted as a newspaper ollice. StuA
dents edit the contributions of the
beginners. writc important stories
prepare the copy for the printer. write
headlines, make up the dummy and
write editorials.

WRITING

  

A Carter Pen is a treat to
the eyes, but the real autis-
faction comes when you start

to write. Gently the finger:
guide the smooth, ﬂexible
point which responds imme-
diately to your particular
style of handwriting. An
enduring nib of long weir-
ing osmiridium prevents ﬁn-
ger fatigue —— assures any,
fatigue-free writing. Built
into the cup of the Curler
Pen is the Rocker Spring
Clip released by a slight fin-
ger pressure. The pen slip:
from the pocket without
pulling, jamming, or wear
and tear.
