Ossy Brooks pitched a spectacu-
lar and. at the same time, steady
game Saturday against Ilartwiek.
It was understood that lack of prac—
tice would cause a disappointing rc—

 

 

 

‘sult, so that State College was more

or less t.ll"L‘ttIl>UllllL‘.

However, rosters who attended
were overjoyed to ﬁnd a man who
could throw eleven times at a
queer-shaped wooden plate and with
unerring accuracy make each throw
good. Brooks threw eleven con-
secutive strikes in the ﬁrst and sec-
ond innings. Thus the ﬁrst three
Hartwick men were retired.

'l‘lic most itotit‘t-alile result of the

lack of przn'tive was the number of.

errors made in the second inning
l-lartwit‘k Ht‘tu‘t‘tl three runs on one
hit and three errors. 'llie lir~t
came when lie Laura ran in for i
grounder from third and threw the
hall to lint llhll'utl of to third
where Satiiideiw. >lltll'l‘lltlt, hail rov-

cred the runner who was formed
from .«ci‘uiid. 'lihe throw went over
(ioodrit'li‘< head.

The second was committed by
Goodrich who allowed a fast one
to get through him. Moreland
fumbled a grounder between ﬁrst

and second, and when he ﬁnally got

hold of it. he threw to home instead

of to second where the runner was

forced from ﬁrst. There were two
men out. thus the putout at second
would have retired the side
