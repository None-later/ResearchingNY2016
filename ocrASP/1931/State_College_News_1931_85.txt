PROHIBITION Liw

Modiﬁcation of Prohibition Liiw
Will Lead to Temperance,
Mrs. Kelley Says

Mrs. Marion Booth Kelley was
the speaker for the afﬁrmative in
the debate on the question of re-
pealing the eighteenth amendment,
which was conducted in the assem»
bly Friday, Mrs. Kelley based
many of her arguments on the re-
port of the Wiekersham committee.
She pointed out that temperance is
a moral rather than a political issue
and that, while all people should be
temperate in everything, the matter
of total abstinence is entirely per-
sonal. “This intrusion into the con-
stitution takes away the right of
moral decision which is part of the
Anglo-Saxon ideal of liberty”, she
said.

The speaker for the negative,
Mrs. Leigh Colvin, state president
of the Women‘s Christian Temper-
ance Union, pointed out that the
liquor industry is a parasitic one be-
cause for the same amount of capi-
tal invested such an industry cin-
ploys fewer men than any other iii-
dustry. Mrs. Calvin also said that,
although the spectacular crimes are
increasing. the actual number «ll
crimes has not increased since pro-
hibition. contrary to current idca‘.
She also disputed Mrs. Kelleys
interpretation of temperance as the
normal indulgence of natural ap—
petites. Mrs, (.‘uli'in added that
while temperance may be a moral
issue, prohibition is a political one
which is aimed at the liquor trafﬁc
as a national problem rather than
a state one.
