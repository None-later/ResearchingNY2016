Novelist Compares Literature and
Life in ' Address Thursday
Night.

‘ Literature is merely an Vitlealizatiun
of life, according to Thornton Wilder,
in a lecture dealing with the subject
“Literature and. Life” at the Albany
Historical and Arts Institute last
Thursday night._ Mr. Wilder is atr-
thor of the Pulitzer prize winning
novel; “The llridge of San Luis Rey"
and .“The Woman of Andros."

Othellp,. he said, made one last
grand speech before his death. Ruth
Snyder attempted to do the same, rut
failed to achieve the poetic philosophy
of Shakespeare's character. Thus, he
concluded. in real life a man is the
same as in literature, except that the
literary character is more highly
idealized.

The lecture was attended by many
State college students, and scvera
members of the faculty. It was the
third of a series which included (iil-
bert K. t‘bestertnn. well-known ling-
lish essayist and novel author.
