SQUAD GON'l‘lllllES
PRE-SEASON DRLL

Coach Baker Lands Achievement
and Teamwork of Men
in Floor Work

BY THOMAS RYAN, '34

Sports Editor, laws
The varsity basketball squad will
swing into its third practice on Mon~
day night in the gymnasium of Page

Id .

Coach Rutherford Baker expressed
himself as well pleased with the work
of the candidates, especially the team
work of the transfer students who
have displayed a fast and steady brand
of Grover Hotaling, former
Union college star; Ben Boldt, on—
land Normal graduate and former
coach at Delhi High school; and
Jerry Butler, of the University of
Rochester, have shown themselves to
be of varsity calibre.

Ben Ingraltam, '33, is the only regu—
lar member of the [931-32 quintet
missing from this year's squad. In-
graham held the varsity center posi-
tion for two years and was a leading
ﬁgure in the State offense.

(iil [)e Laura, who was captain of
the varsity with Ingrahani last year,
and Ray Harris, seniors; lx’ogcr Ban-
croft. Ossy Brooks, Bill Nelson,
leiarlic Kissam, Bob Meyers, juniors;
and Cliff Rall and Bill Allard, sopho—
mores, all varsity members last year
are competing for regular berths,

The center post, vacated by Iii-
graham, will be filled by either llzirris
or Boldt. Harris plz :i ~teady
game at center last ’ mm and his
experience at center makes ' a
prime contender for the pivot post.
A stiff battle is being waged for the
forward position among Bancroft, Al-
lard, Brooks, "ss'im, llotaling, and
Butler. Dc Laura and ltall, who
tcamcd at the guard position last year,
are fighting to retain their posts
against Nelson and Meyers.
