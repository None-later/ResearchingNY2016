Dr. Fritz Rager Discusses Unemployment
Insurance Lt Europe In Friday Assembly

"The American system of char-
ity is more essentially a dole sys-

insurance used by the European
countries," said Dr. Fritz Rager, of
the Institute of International Edu-

Friday.

does, and Dr. Rager seems to
think it will adopt a system of em»
ployment insurance. The Euro-

ployed is not large enough to in»
