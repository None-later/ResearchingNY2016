QUINTET, MONDA Y

Playing another fast game, the
freshmen basketball team defeated
Castleton Union high school on the
latter's court Monday night by a
score of 34—17. The frosli attack
was the heaviest of any game this
season.

“Cliff” Rall was the outstanding
player for the visitors. In each
half he caged four baskets, totaling
sixteen points. "Dave" Kronian
played a steady game both on the
offense and defense. The team's
passwork was snappy, being a great
improvement over previous engage-
inents.

'l‘he fi'osli displayed a new brand
of attack to penetrate Custletoii’s
five-man defense and score at will.
Rall caged a basket in the opening
minute of play to give the frosli
the lead which they never relin—
quished throughout the game.
