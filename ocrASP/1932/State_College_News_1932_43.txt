"He succeeds who helps others
to succeed,” Dr. Ross Hoople, pro-
fessor of philosophy at Syracuse
university, told the delegates at
the conference for men and women
conducted at Cortland State Nor-
mal school last week-end.

This was one of the paths which
Dr. Hooplc advises as a standard,
of a personal philosophy of life
because he says it does not allow
for conﬂict with any other ideal
in the attempt to bring order out
of the chaos in which the human
race exists. He pointed out that
inmost ethical situations one is not
concerned with things intrinsically
good or bad, but with which of
two desireablc paths one shall fol-
low. Otbcr suggested standards
on which to form a philosophy
wcre the welfare of s0ciety and
the welfare of the individual.

Paul Harris, Jr., student of ill-
lernational relations and authority
on peace, led a discussion on sub-
jects touching on Hitlerism, coin-
munism, the le‘ East crisis, India
and the disarmament conference.

The theme of the conference was
“Student Interest Beyond the Class—
