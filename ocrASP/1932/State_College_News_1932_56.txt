Dean Pierce said, “and my expec-

Most of the ISO students who

are seniors, the Dean’s files show.
Next comes sophomores, then
freshmen, and finally the juniors.

At least SIP/z of the men earn

200 College Students Earn Part Way
Despite Depression, Dean Pierce Says

College authorities watch care-
fully the scholarship of the stu-
dents who work and when it ap-
proaches the danger line the stu-
dent is sometimes forced to give
up his work. Work smitetintcs in-
terferes with scholarship, because
the students are compelled to
work very late in order to keep up
their class work.

Health is one of the most im—
portant factors to he considered,
the D‘an thinks. It is one of the
chief reasons why students are
forced to give up work. Students
who work ordinarily do not havc
opportunity to shine in college ac!
tivities, except in unusual cases.

A sum of $500 per year will put
a woman student through a year of
College at the present time, pro-
vided she does not indulge in too
great a \t'ardrohc. sht- estimates.
Matty students finance their way
through college hy summer work
and hy borrowing sums lt‘utl)
hanks.

“All in all, if a student really
wants an education, he trill find a
way to ohtain if, r 'ardlcss of any
or every ohstacl llcan l'irrcc

THE QUESTION BOX

Question:—"What do you think of
the new rules for banner rivalry,
in which the time limit is ex-
tended frnm 8 o'clock the day
preceeding the soiree until 3
o’clock the following Monday
morning "

Shirley Diamond, ’34:—“l think
it will eventually stop rivalry
completely. Howev , it cer-
tainly will make soircc a more
dignified affair and allow the
freshmen to attend it in greater
numhers."

William Jones, ‘35:—”I tltink
rivalry w s too quiet ltt'fl'll't', and
this rttle certainly doesn't make
it more exciting. I think there
should he mort- rivalry, hecaust-
it fosters a greater dt'grcc of col—i
lcm- spirit, Now. there is no

Peryl Whipple, '35:~“l think that
this rule will not he fair to the
freshmen. How can it he called

Philip Riccardi, ’34:~“l think this
