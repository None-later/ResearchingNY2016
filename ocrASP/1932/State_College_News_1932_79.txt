When the Shelton opened
(7 years ago) we began ca-
tering to college men and
women. Gradually their
patronage has increased:
weafeel safe in asserting
that more students make
the Shelton their New York
home than at any club or
other hotel. One reason for
tlils is the free recreational
features plus a desire to
serve on the part of Shelton
employees. Room rates
have been greatly reduced.
Rafi-s front $50 per month
upward. A room from $2.50
