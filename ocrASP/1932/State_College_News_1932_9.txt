Will Begin Moving Books Into Hawley
Library In Two Months, Engineer Says

By the end of two months, the
new Gideon Hawlcy library will be
ready for occupancy, according,r to
a statement made today by
Francis Guinau, chief engineer of
the College. The last step toward
the completion of the library was
begun during the Christmas recess,
when student life utterly deserted
the institution.

l\Ir. Guiuau was conﬁdent, that
conditions being favorable, the work
of moving books into the library
will begin at the end of two months
Dr. 1\. R. llruhacher, president,
stated early this semester that he
expected the library to be ready by
the latter part of March or the
early part of April.

The work consists of tearing up
the old flooringr of both the gym—
nasium and the old auditorium.
Supports for the new lltnn‘ittg‘ will

torium will he used for the library

Other Innovations

Two other innovations, one of
which has been completed, the
other is rapidly on its way toward
finality, are part of State college
contribution toward the relief 0
unemployment. These innovations
are the two new sidewalks. One is
on Western nreuuc at the extreme
west end of the campus, begun on
Noremher Ill. and the other is to
extend across the back and east
side campus.

"These jobs employed forty—eight
men." says Mr. Guinau, The work
on the library employs twenty-eight
men. State‘s contribution for the

 

relief of unemployment is serenty-
two men.
