GLEAYES PROGRAM
MOST INTERESTING

Remarkable Wild Life Shots
Are Principal Feature
Of Pinchot Film

Howard (Tic-aces, wild life photog-
rapher, carried approximately 250
summer session students with him
on a motion picture journey of the
South Seas last Wednesday even-
ing.

Inclement weather and perhaps a
desire to make preparation for ex~
aminations combine to keep the
size of the attendance lower than
was expected. The quality of Mr.
Cleaves" pictures and his lecture
warranted a record attendance.

1! was the general opinion of the
audience that Mr. Cleavcs’ was the
best program presented in the Wed—
nesday eveningr series so far this
session.

Some really remarkable ‘sliots'
with a camera were displayed, es-
pecially in the motion pctiires of
birds and seals. .\vlr. Cl‘avcs' well
selected \vord pictures added much
to the quality of the entertainment.
His likening of a Galapagos turtle
to “ an old man in a covered
wagon " and his describing the gills
of a South Sea ﬁsh as ” bigger than
any pancake ever cooked in Al-

 

  

bany " are but two examples of the

human interest injected into the

lecture by these \vord pictures,
AccordincV to Mr. Cleave, the

“world's most atrocious garment”
is the Mother Hubbard, now largely
worn by the Polynesian women in
the place of their native pareu. At
the opening of his lccture, Mr.
(leaves displayed a ﬂaming iiarcu,
and later showed pictures of llic nat
tivcs in both costumes.

While his talk and pictures were,
admittedly vcry intcre-tini; to the‘
audience of school teachers and‘:
Would»be school teachers, we can
readin see why Mr. (leaves is also
in demand by luncheon clubs ainl
such organirations.

Part of the SlllIlUlllllt‘hS ol' the
program is doubtless to be credited
to the motion picture opcrator. who

Instructors Assign Several Reasons For
Growth In Attendance At Summer Session

Various reasons arr- assigned for
the enrollment in the
Summer Sission this year. Some
of the opinions expressed by faculty

increased

members are as follows:

llr. Arthur lx'. Bt‘lbi. professor of
education: “ .\ large majority of the
pcrmiis who are in my classes seem
to be primarin interested in pro—
lessioiizil improvement. The number
of applicants for the Master's degree
is very large."

lJr. Uonnal
professor of history,

V. Smith, assistant
"l‘lie profes-
is becomincI somewhat ovcr~
.\lany tvacbcrs feel that
their qualiﬁca-
secure

sion
crowded.
they must increast
tioiis in order to retain or
good positions,"

llr. llavid llutchison. professor
of government: "I cannot think of
any one cause unless it is the dc-
pressisn"

.\lr. (ietirge .\l. York, professor of

commerce: "i believe the increased
attendance is part due to economic
conditions and the raising of 5 ate
requirements loi' teacher ccrtihca-
tion."
Mr. l‘anl ll. Sheats. instructor in
government: " it is my beliel that
the increase may be explained to a
large extant as a perlectly normal
ilevilopmcnt. a development that is
in keeping with the annual Increase
in the pawl few ycars. Since l‘)Z‘}
the rate of increase has varied, but
has always been over 1 ',i. l is
pt'rit'cll} natural that a student .‘iéll—
islied with the program winch he is
able to receive here, should return
the succeeding summer, Moreover,
as a result of publicity which llt‘
’ ' given to the session he is tlullt'
‘Iy to he rtspoiisihle lor the ap-
llt‘ill’illlk'l.‘ ot a new stiidciit.’

in (inner ol itl'l'illlgl’lllt'lllN lor the
non reunion ol .\lyltania lill‘llt

ails.

.\lr. Harry Birchcnough, profes-
sor of mathematics: “'l'here seem
to be three special reasons, namely:
the requirements for teachers, the
depression and the emphasis placed
on the professional side of teach-

H. A. Dobcll, assistant pro~
of inathcmatic. “"he in~
c sc in enrollment at this summer
session man not be alributcd to im-
mediate causes. The events which
have given us greater enrollments
{or the last two summers have
gained a momentum which has not
been diminished appreciably by re-
tardinp, forces. ‘lhe factors which
seem to have contributed to the im-
petus are:

“ (1) the economic depression in
ollering no employment and the ap-
peal of a free tuition institution.

l ” t2) the wider spread knowledge
of our [5.5. or Education degree, its
prerequisites, requirements, and
privileges,

"(3) new administration princi—
ples.

‘(~ll the continued pressure of
school boards and administrators on
teachers to take summer or exten-
sion work."
