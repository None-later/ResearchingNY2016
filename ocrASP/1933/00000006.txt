SPORT SHOTS

The packed bleachers Friday
night testiﬁed to the co-eds‘ interest
in basketball. They have an inter-
est in their own team after alll
They showed that they were ready
to back not merely a winning team.
but one which beats colleges of high
calibre and reputation.

.\ud llniiiiltoii defeated llohai't

the time of ~lS-l.l. Yet the assertion
has been Illilllt‘ hy those lllttltt‘l‘ up
that the i‘sity would lie ineapabh
of playing and nu\\i!' _ to meet
more than one major opponent per
season.

Once again we hear the old criti-
cisms that follow a major contest
cr.t,cisms pertaining to coaching
from the bench and allowing men
of three or more years' college ex—
perience to participate in vars.ty
games. We thought that petty dit-
ticultics were irone out by the
alumni last year. Last year the at-
tack concerncd the colleges of minor
reputation whom State meets. .A
ﬁle of refusals from leading eastern
colleges for games on the State
schedules testiﬁes to State‘s willing-
ness to meet such iiistitut.ons. But
these colleges have nothing to gain
and everything to lose if they play
us. hence they refuse offers. And
now the vein of attack shifts to an—
other petty issue.

rented the varsity from running up
