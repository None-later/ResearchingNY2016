CO-OI’ERA'J‘ION ASKED

For the first time in several years. State college stit-
dents will have the opportunity to participate in a formal
receiving line and a formal line of tnarcli. This oppor-
tunity will he furnished tonight at the annual junior
Pruitt. The juniors are inaugurating the one. and re-
viviiig the other in an attempt to make the dance a more
digniﬁed and stately occasion The class is expecting the
co-operation and support of members of the other cla s
in making tltis ceremony as well as the entire evening a
success.

For some time. State college students have appeared
lax in paying the proper amount of attention and cour-
tesy to those faculty members who have consented to act
as cliapcrones. l‘revionsly, facitlty guests have been
herded into one corner and ignored throughout the entire
evening except by those few who had arranged the
faculty programs.

This year. members of the faculty have expressed their
sitit‘cre willingness to take active part in the program
for the evening. :\.s representatives of the junior class
and of the student hotly. let its make them feel that they
are appreciated as well as welcome.

Ken Miller has certainly accom—

son I-ligh outﬁt. .Miller's team
completely outclassed Milne High.
Their "sleeper" play during the ﬁrst
half should never have worked.
but they repeatedly caught Milne
ﬂat-looted for easy baskets. The
visitors showed an exceptional
brand of passwork. They had plenty
of lighting spirit and were a credit
to Coach "Abe."
