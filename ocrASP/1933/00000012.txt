IS YOUR TAX PAID?

A curtailment of student activities for the rest of
the year, with the possibility that this may be the last
issue of the .\'i-;\\s, is the situation which now exists
as a result ofas a result of the failure of more than
ltalf of the stndtut body to pay their annual tax as-
s ‘ntcnt. The student association of this College
is a voluntary organization, made up of a group oi
students who are banded together iii a co-operative
body for tltc purpose of tltc group and individual
.»\t [be present time, half of this group has
shown a dcliilite In of \villing' "s to co-opcratc

these tll'l.’,itl|lYltlltill~t will he cut iii two. The .\'it\\'s‘
has published tiflct‘tt issues during the lirst semester;
the yearly schedule provides for thirlyvtwo issues.
'l‘ltcitfore this titty per cent cut sitttply means that
the remaining half oi the schedule cannot be coni-
plctcd. However, if enough sludtiits pay their taxes
williiii the next week, it may be possible to carry on
for a while- longer. The News is merely being used

THE COMMENTSTA’IER '

 

\\ c were delighted the other night with the sports-
tttattlike attitude oi the .‘xtatt: cheering section; our
heart was tilled with warnt approval oi the applause
for the Seth Low player wno was injured and oi

close oi_tht: game. _
out spirit contrasted sharply with the hasty "boos"

\vm'ded by a victory 11] the return game. 1

among our various female friends tor the last week,
we have been trying to understand the new system
of preferential bidding. \\u have done fairly well;
these are our conclusions: If a. freshman receives
t bid from lita l‘hi, btit ptt'fcrs’ to join 1\:tppa IJclta
t\'lto, she cannot accept a hid from the ladward lil~
drcd l,'otter club tor two and thrc ightlts years.
lit the event, liowt-vci‘, that she t'cceivcs a bid front
the soror y wlticli she wishes to joiit, slit: may ac-
cept, provided that ltotlt the sorority attd sht- ‘
willing. .\lot‘coit-l', if lite yr elapse hctwvcit hci
ll‘t"»lllltitll and sophomore ycnt , she will probably be
kicked otit of school t'tlways ptovtilcd, of L'tilll'M‘, that

and dances), and it will tlicn be ticccs try for Itt't' to
marry iitto tltc sorority. littrtltt-rtiio , decorations
ttinst itot he used at rush parties. because someone
might choke a frcsliittziti to death with a streamer,
and that would make lici‘ ineligible for membership iii
:ttty sorority. Alli-r thi't-e evenings of thinking
thoughtful thought» we decided that it was a simple
solution of a knotty problem; almost anyone cottld
discover what sorority a freshman belongs to alter
: ltll‘l't' thtet: months of stcnographic work and a
course iit integral calculus.

:\: a matter it ' '1. we gather that the new sy’
tent is really prat able, and that it has * '
tt'orkcd during this I. st \VUI'It~CIllI, which is
required of it, The oitly llaw lies in tltt
pcrltaps ft'cslititcit may not understand that if llicy
are willing to actt-pt a bid front only one particular
sorority, llll‘y must be careful ttot to write the n'uuc
of more than ttlll' sororin on their preference rtls.
That, ltotVt-vcr is a minor point, and merely demands
