THE SENIOR (illf'l‘

The senior class has announced its class gift to the
College in the form of a memorial fund to purchase books
for the Gideon llawley library. The interest from the
fund will he used each year to buy hooks for the library
which otherwise might not have been purchased, because
of the limited budget of the library and the necessity
for keeping the course and reference books completely
up to date. It is right and ﬁtting that the year which
marks the graduation of the class of 1933 from the College
should also mark the dedication of the new llawley li‘
hrary, and that the class should choose to make its
traditional gift in this form.

l‘rcvious gills have included such items as memorial
stained glass windows, equipment for the Lounge, pictures,
placqiies, and the clock in the Page hall tower. The
establishing of such a book fuml as the class of 1933 con-
templates will provide a lnsling, pcrpclual monument
to the memory of the class. The books which will be
bought from this fund will be marked with a special
book-plate of the class. The 10.1.! memorial books will
live forever.

Sunday night at midnight the mascot hunt will begin,
and each night next week will see hordes of ambitious
freshmen scurrying to and fro ill the ) ‘cnri:h for
the sophomore mascot. Someone once -11. rkcd that it
wasn't until the week for mascot hunt arrived that the
school realized the content of the freshman class, ninl
the pep and enthusiasm they had stored away all year.
Certainly it is a week when one learns to know all the
crooks and crannies of the Colle'e buildings, to know
one's own classmates, and to realize some of the trlic
fun and friendship in the rivalry events between the
freshman and sophomore classes.

Even if the mascot is not found, the wack is valuable
in many ways. it is not often that :1 class ﬁnds the
mascot. For three years freshmen havu . 'irched, 111111
in vain, as far as discovering the hiding place of the
emblem. but surely they will all agree lll’il the discoveries
of other more \’i|lllltl)ll: things 111 ide mascot hunt week
an event they will never forget.

   
   

 

 

TRADITION CHANGES

The proposed changes in the tradition and inter-class
rivalry rules which will be voted upon today in the stu-
dent assembly deserve the cureflll thought and consid-
eration of every member of the student body. Such
changes will assume a more or less permanence in the
history of the College student activity, and should there-
fore be discussed and decided intelligently without any
attempts at grandstand play or dry and unresponsive
humor. it is imperative that the question he decided
this week in order that the regular Moving-Up Day
activities may be scheduled and organized for the proper
times.

Because of the belief on the part of the College physi-
cians and of the Administration that the pole-rush and
the tug-of-war are too strenuous and too injurious activ-
ities, it has been suggested. that a push-ball contest be
substituted for the pole—rush, and a program of track
events for the tug-of—war. It is not the purpose of this
article to influence any one in any way. It is merely
to make each student realize the importance of the ques-
tion, the history of the situation, and the necessity for
prompt and careful consideration and decision upon this
matter.

AS the earth turns. By Gladys Hasty Carroll.
millan. $2.50. 33‘) pages.

“As the earth turns is an intimate, delightful study
of New England. As a story " holds its charm page
by page to the end." So writes \Ylllllllll Allen White,
in a prc-view of this newest of the Macmillan publica-
tions. This novel, in its simplicity of setting, is thor-
ollgllly an American novel, aml takes the Shaw falliin
through a year ili their life, a life which is entirely de-
pendent upon the soil for existence. it is one of the best
of the spring crop of books, and will probably meet with
approval on all sides.

111 this one year the Shaws' experience birth, death,
Iiiarriagc, revolt within the family, success for one of
the sons ill the outside world, and the coming of foreign
Ileiglibors to mingle their ways and blood with the native
Yankee. The book is divided into livc sections, Winter,
Spring, Summer, Fall, and Winter again, and as the year
rolls around the life of each Shaw becomes an Indivduah
story of interest for the reader. 1111: author Is consi -
cntly ﬁne iii her characterization, and she has a distii .l
zest for living which gives each sentence warmth and
power.

While writes: "Here are courage with humor, purpose
without cant, idealism mixed with practical common
sense. The characters in the story dramatize the fun-
damental virtues of America and yet: bye and shine‘as
human beings. It i ~—and there Is no other word which
exactly describes it .1 beautiful book."

Constance Lindsay Skinner has said of the book~
“The conception of this book 15 poctr , '_ . .
plane of poetry all the minutiae of Ila y life III at family
of impociic indivnlllals. hear the symphony of the
carlh as the themes unite in a big, slow, inevitable rhythiii
of the seasons. There Is, to my sense, great beauty in
this. . . . llut l mu Sllll most IIIIpI‘essed by tho Inag~

communion

Our wonder has been aroused by the manner in which
the discus"on of the pole-rush was conducted in assem-
bly last l’riday. There was something curiously queer
about allowing us to talk about the rush for half all hour
before "suggesting gently" that there would be 1111 pole-
rush this year in any case since the Aaninistration is

opposed to it.

Our only purpose is to encourage a direct statement
of the Administration's opillioii. The position of the
President certainly insures a respect for his wishes, and
our position as a student body makes his opinions highly
i111portant to us, especially concerning our student nlfairs.
l’crsonally, we believe that the Administration could, if
it wished, go straight to the assembly aml secure a whole-
licnrteil co-opclatimi from that body. It would llnve
seemed logical and helpful to know what the President
thinks of the pole-rush, for, after all, he is more aware
of and sensitive to the repercussions of olir activities in
the more or less outside world than we who live almost
entirely iii the College.

We since cly hope that thc discussion scheduled for
today w1|| clear 11p our confusion; that either the Ad-
ministration or the two gentlemen who evidently felt
authorized to state the AllImnistl'ation's attilndc will
explain openly what was hinted to be hiding behind the
situation.

The resolutions proposed by Myskania making prcsenl
auplioniorc rillcs culleg trlu tho s cm to us to II '
adoptlondiy the 218th tion. l'hcre are two reasons for
our opinion: (I) l-rcslmicn (and I)1llCl'<Cli|SSlllUlll will
have more res 112111 for tradition Iliali for oppr-ssioii by
the hated sopionlorcs. l'hc entire school will ensure
disobedience IllSltMtl of just a class of_11nc-yt:.1r-remochl-
freshmen. (2i l‘hcrc Will be less ilicllicil-lcy in the oil-
forcing of the rules. Myuknnm, as the guardian of tr:
dit1on, and pulgmg by past perforninm.1. will have more
control over disobedicnt freshmen. \Vc 1.1ve never seen
a genuine cnforccnunit by lhl: sopliomor hula; we have
heard of frcshmcIi being called before Myskania for using
the front door at |)r.iper 11.11.

 

 

 

 

 

 

  
 
 

“Poetry is the expression of unfa-
miliar beauty of the world; beauty
which is the smile upon the face of
truth," stated Edwin Markham, the
dean of American poets, at a lecture
in the page hall auditorium last Thurs-
day night.

This deﬁnition of poetry came at
the end of a discussion on the sub-
stance of poetry. Markham proffered
deﬁnitions from the ancients. Zoras-
ter, the Persian prophet, stated that
the poet is a man who makes appar-
ent the other parent." It is the poet
who comes to explain the hidden mys-
tery—"the meaning of things as the
angels see them." Aristotle's deﬁni-
tion closely follows that of Zuraster,
for it states that an artist is :1 man who
completes the incomplete designs of
nature. "There is no great beauty or
wonder without rangeness," stated
Lord Byron. l‘lt is this that a poet
must reveal."

More modern writers such as Coler-
idge and Edgar Allen Poe believed
that poetry was the illumination in the
case of science. The lack of strange—
ness would be noticeable to such an
extent that the poem written would
not be classed as a good poem. l’oetry
comes out of feeling; thought has to
do with prose.

Markham closed his IliSCIIssion with
the following statement: “ ioct is
forever young and speaks the immor-
tal tongue. Ile turns the whole uni-
verse ililo a song, but he is Iiot :1 true
[met if his sole purpose is to teach.
Above all things, he must inspire.

:\ gallant gentleman with llowing
white hair, Markham next turned to
his 01in poems. l"l'Ulll the pile of
books before him he chose to recite
several qnalrziins and :i poem to his
son \'crgil. He also read the prize
poem, “Lincoln, the Man of the l‘co-
do," which was l‘ 'st read in I‘ll}. in
front of the Lincoln .\lemorial in

“Strangeliess Is a Necessity in Poetry,"
Says Edwin Markham, American Poet.

Washington, I). C.. "The Man with
the Hoe," written in protest against
drudgery, marked the peak of all his
readings. It was this poem which
ﬁrst brought the poet ipto prominence.

Markham was )resented tinder the
joint auspieces o the Young Men's
and Young Women's Christian Asso-
ciations. A graduate of the State
Normal at San Jose, California, this
poet passed through the stages of he-
' a romantic young schoolmaster,
the principal of a school and a journal-
' . l'le recounted many humorous
incidents which seem to have cropped
up so plentifully during his lifetime.

A reception, sponsored by the Ed«
ward Eldrcd l’otter Club, was coli-
dllctcd in the lounge of Richardson
luill. Those who attended were prin
ileged to hear Markham's viewpoints
on v "uus subjects. Among these
Emerson," "Edgar Allen l’oe,"
“red lips," “smoking by Women" mid
"leaching poetry." "1c lust subject
is to be contained in :1 future publica-
tion which will be entitled “Plain
talks on l’oetrv."

At present his most recent publica-
tion is “Eighty Songs o " This
was issued last year by his f .uls in
New York to commemorate his eighti-
clb birthday.

Wherever you buy
Chesterﬁelds,you get

A friend of" CHESTERFIELD writes us of

11 salesman who had "smoothing to say”:

"I dropped into a little tobacco shop,
and when I asked for a pack of Chest-
erfields the man smiled and told me I
was the seventh customer without a
break to ask for Clicstcrfields. 'Smoker
after smoker,’ he said, 'tclls me that
Cliestorliclds click . . . I sell five times
as runny Clicstcrliclds as I did a while

Yes, there’s something to say about Chest-
erliclds and it takes just six words to any

it—"Tlicy’ro mild and yet they satisfy.”
