Co-operation

Tonight, with the opening presentation of "Patience",
the ﬁrst co-nperativc production between the Girls’ Athletic
association and the men's ’I‘roubadour organization receives
its ﬁnal test. For several years there has been some dis-
cussion of such a joint production as this, btit this year
marks the first joint presentation of the two organizations.
In times when cu-nperaiion is nine-tenths of living. it is
noteworthy that such an attempt as this has been made.

The Mascot Hunt

The animal mascot limit has been going on this week
with much industrious activity on the part of the it‘t’slt-
man cl: ’s each night to locate the hiding place oi the
mascot. Dirt. dust and grime irom hitherto unknown attics,
