NEED FOR SOLI DARITY

Undauuted freshman spirit again was demonstrated
last week when the yearling class engaged in the annual
or III hunt. Although the purpose was to uncover the
hidden trophy and ultimately a five-point victory. the fresh-
men nevertheless adopted a sportsmanlike attitude in the
face of deft-at. Again and again it has been shown that the
mascot hunt is an influential factor in the cementing of the
members of the yearling class into a more iIIIpI-rsonal and
friendly organization. Until this point freshman solidarin
was a doubt: afterwards its assurance was more than
probable.

It has been suggested that the mascot hunt or some
' ' for which a combination of people would bc a
Iry factor. be scheduled earlier in the year. This is
a highly practicable and valuable idea. It will be demon-
strated beginning next year with the launching of the new
set of rules and traditions. one of which is a challenge to
either a debate or a sing in the first semester of the year.

   

  

LIBRARY RETURNS

A decided incrcasc in Ihc number of losses of books
from the reserve shclrc' in thc llawley hall library seems
to indicatt . parallel (lt't Iht' in the integrity of the mem—
hcrs of thc ('ollcgc studrnt body. It has been at the expensi-
of much time and Inoncy that the new faciliIIcs in thc
llawlI-y hall “111- made available to the student body: it
seems unfortuuatc that they should Itsslttllt‘ this manner of
expressing their .‘Ipprcciatiun for the work of the librarians.

According to statistics Innouuccd by Miss Mary t'ohb.
College librarian. lllt'l't' are two Ihou~nnd books on flIc
rcscrrc shclvr. and at the present time our hundred of
thcsc books are missing. Lost. slr \‘t'tl, or stolrn? \Vc have
only our faith in humanity to allow [Is In hopc that MllllL‘
of these fall in the first two caII-gorics. In our cast- in
particular Ilu-rc has brcu a very important rciI-rcucc hook,

 

   

 

 

  

used all scmcstcr by niIIrty ~tudcul~ without any difficulty.
which disapprarcd la~l wcrlc. carping much difficulty to
thou,- siltllrtfls who Ilt‘sil't‘ to usi- the book.

It has bccu Miltgl‘hlt'tl that if ~tllllt‘ way wI-rt- providle
for >llllll'lll> fo I'IIIII'II some of lhc~c missing.- hooks in an
unobtrusiw manner, a Icw oI' Ihr lost \llt't'll might return
to the fold. The lllt‘llllft‘l‘~ of lllt‘ XI.\\'s hoard would like to
offer thvir \t‘l'\ll'tf.~ as t'llIlsﬁtl‘ll“. lI' ' sIIIrh-III would

STATE COLLEGE NEWS. MAY 18. 1933

BUREAU PREDICTS UNSE'I‘TLED WEATHER FOR TOMORROW”

Moving-pr Day is probably the
only time in tlte school year that the
clttirc student body is concerned with
w 'ther predictions atul conditions
l‘iL‘tl b_v atmospheric disturbances.

'l‘hc L‘nitcd States weather bureau
records unsettled weather for tonight
with :Ill prohabilitics that the sun will
shiuc today and that the stars “will
pct-p" tonight. 'l‘onInrrow's weather is
uncertain doc to the abundance of low

   

pressure areas in the southern ficr and
the northern part of Pennsylvania.
Climatic conditions in the middle wcst
record that rain and low temperature
have been cudurctl for the past few
days.

The Inetvorologist's predictions in-
cline toward favorable weather, but
the uncertainty that the students will
cIIjoy sunshine and fair weather to-
morrow Is still :I doubt.

For the past four years favorable
weather was dominant at the annual
ceremonies, with the exception that
there were slight showers three years
ago. The repetition of this occurrence
is highly improbable.

More often than not the campus was
wet from heavy showers earlier in the
week bcforc Moving-Up Day. making
the pole-rush a muddy battle.
