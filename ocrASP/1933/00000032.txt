NEED FOR SOLIDARI'I‘Y

Undaunlcd frcshmun spirit again was demonstrated
last week when the yearling class engaged in the animal
mascot hunt. Although the purpose was to uncover the
hidden trophy and ultimately a five-point victory. the fresh—
men nevertheless adopted a sportsmanlike attitude in the
face of dcft-at. Again and again it has been shown that the
mascot hunt is an influential factor in the cementing of the
members of thc ' class into a more iinpcrsnnal and
fricndly organization. Until [his point fi‘t‘slnunn solidarity
was a doubt: afterwards its assurance was more than
probable.

It has hccn suggested that thc mast'ol hunt or sonn-
activity. for which a combination of people would he a
necessary factor. hc scheduled earlier in the year. This
a highly practicable and valuable idea. it will he demon-
stratcd beginning next year with the launching of the new
scl of rules and traditions. one of which is a challenge to
either a dcbntc or a sing in the first scmcstcr of the year.

LIBRARY RETURNS

A dccidcd increase in the ninnhcr of losses of books
from the i'cscrvc shc ' s 'n the llawlcy hall library scents
to indicalc u p. ulch llt't ‘dSt‘ in the integrity of the mem-
bers of the College studcnl body. It has liccil at the t‘xpcnsc
of much timc and money that the new facilities in lhc
llil\\' y hall \vci‘c made uvailahlc to tln- student body; it
set-Ins inil'oi'lniiutc that they should assume this munnc '
cxprcssing their appreciation for the work of thc libr'

According lo statistics annonnccd by Miss Mary (‘ohlg

STATIC COLLEGE NEWS, MAY 18, 1933

BUREAU PREDICTS UNSE’I‘TLED WEATHER FOR TOMORROW

Moving-Up Day is probably the
only time in the school year that the
enlirc student body is concerned with
weather predictions and conditions
ca iscd by atmospheric disturbances.

The United States wcatlicr bureau
records unsettled weather for tonight
with all probabilities that the sun will
shinc today and that the stars “will
pct-p" tonight. 'l‘oniorrmv's wcathcr is
uncertain due to thc abundance of low

pressure areas in the southern tier and
the northern part of Pennsylvania.
Climatic conditions in the middle west
rccnrd that rain and low temperature
have been cndnrcd fur the past few
ays.

The meteornlogist's~ predictions iii-
clinc toward favorable weather, but
lln: uncertainty that the students will
cnjoy sunshine and fair weather to-
morrow is still a doubt.

For the past four years favorable
weather was dominant at the annual
ceremonies, with the exception that
there were slight showers three years
ago. The repetition of this occurrence
is highly improbable.

More often than not the campus was
wet from heavy showers carlier in the
week bcforc Moving-Up Day. making
the pole-rush a muddy battle.

Just two

Yes, I have heard about two
words; and now and then
three words—but “They Sat-
isfy” means “To gratify fully.”

Why do these two words
“they satisfy” ﬁt: Chester-
ﬁelds? Because Chesterfiech

Chesterﬁeld’s way of blend-
