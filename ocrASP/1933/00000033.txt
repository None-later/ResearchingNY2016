President Is Recovering;
To Resume Duties in Fall

A report upon the condition
of Dr. A. R. Brubacher, Col-
lege president, who has been
ill at his home, was given a
representative of the News this
week. The report follows:

“President Brubacher is suf-
fering from the strain and ex-
haustion of his work. A tired
heart demanded complete rest
and quiet. He has responded
very rapidly to the rest treat-
ment and is now able to sit up
in bed. He will spend his sum-
mer according to his physi-
cian’s orders and expects to re-
turn to his regular duties with
the reopening of College in
September."

"He is very grateful for the
many warm expressions of
friendly interest from individ-
ual students and from student
groups as well as from the
facility. I-le regrets especially
his inability to present the di-
plomas to the class of 1933."
