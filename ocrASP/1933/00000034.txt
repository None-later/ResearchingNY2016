less than one month from today. The term, conmicncc-
ment, really means beginning, alld for those members of
the class of 1933, Jilin: 1‘) will mark the beginningr of their
active careers in this outer world of ours.

For iour years tllcy have been active in the student
affairs of Stale college, all the time mailitaiuli their
regular scholastic standings. For three years they steadily
pushed their way up into the public eye of the student
body and faculty. Last June they becaiin: seniors—leaders
of the College. 'l'hroughout this year, the class of 1933
has ranked first in the prestige of the College, not alone
on account of i . senio ly.

Soon it will be necessaly for each senior to hid lurc-
wcll to the much loved College scenes and friends. Soon
it will be necessary for the iilldcrclassmcn to clasp each
senior hand iii friendship for the last time.

of us who are remaining. and that inaliy oi lllt'lll are going

STATE COLLEGE NEWS, MAY 25, 1933

OUR I’RESTDENT
Dr. A. R. Brubacher, president, has recently suffered
a breakdown, and will be unable to return to official duties
until next September. This has been the first time iii years
that the president of the College has not been present for
the annual Moving-Up Day ceremonies. '

I I)r.IBrubachcr will also be unable to preside at gradua-
tion this June. He has expressed his regret at his inability
to present the diplomas at this time.

The members 0f the student association silicerely hope
that Dr. Brubacher lell rapidly regain his health and be
able to come back With renewed strength.

MUST THIS CONTINUE?

Rccclitly a member of the faculty of this College,
while taking a shower iii the men's locker room of Draper
hall, was robbed of a small sum of money. It seems that
he had left his clothing iii the locker room for bilt a few
minutes; when he returned, be discovered money, papers,
and the general contents of his pockets gone. Th' is not
the first time that money, or articles of clothing, have
been deliberately stolen from the locker rooms.

Nor do the clever clcptomaliiacs conﬁne their activities
to money alone. Miss Fay rcports many books missing
fronl the College Co-opcriitive Book Store loan shelves.
Over a hundred have been taken from I-Iawlcy library.
The articles posted on the lost bulletin board are too num-
erous to mention. Certainly books pens girls. 5, or pocket-
books did liot grow legs alid w . by themselves.

What is lllc answer? Someone in State college (prob-
ably niore than one) is dishonest enough to l’ll'L' articles
which do lint belong to him. True enough tiles are hard
times—but the times are harder for the one who '
stand the loss than the one who is the temporary \\llltlL'I'.
It is now toward the latter part of the year. The majority
of students here, if ever. are now on rnct' bottom as far
: ﬁnances are concerned. " o:- some valuable article,
books, money, means a deﬁnite hole in the budget as well
as a deﬁnile loss and privation.

GRAI.)UATES ORG; NIZE
estcrday marked the ﬁrst social event of the graduate
students of State college. ’l‘hronghout the entire year in-
dividual iileniliers of this group have seen the need of for-
mation into some deﬁnite organization. Until now nothing
has been done about it.

Last night, in the gymnasium of Ilawlcy hall. the
graduate studcnts conducted an informal party. t was
very well attelided, aml all of those who attended sceni-
iugly enjoyed themselves. it is to be wondered at that this
group has not before conducted some sort of a social
function.

At State college, it would seem that the graduate stil-
denls are entirely out of the picture. All of the classes
here have class illcctillgs, parties, dances, dinners. Nearly
every department has its club and its social iulictioiis. Ile-
cause so many of the graduate stlidelits are confining their
studies to education and graduate courses, very few. if
any, are given the opportunity to join iii any social or-
ganization of the College.

Graduate students are not required to attend assemblies;
very few of them c er see the News or any other College
publication. 0n the whole, they are like grown-up orphans,
entirely divorced from College alid the sir-called college
splr

’1 his occasion indicates that on the part of the graduate
students of this College, the spirit is there, at least.

11 is to be hoped that iii future years, nth graduate
students will a ticnlselvos of the opportuni 4 open to
thrill in this 11L (1. May they continue in the same Iiile, and
make something delinit and permanent of this ﬁrst re-
tarded attempt at organization.

(For .vnh! in Culley/c Co-u/l.)

Insecurity, by Abraham Epstein. Ilarrison Smith
and Robert llaas, New York City. $4.110. 0R0 pages.

"I. incc A : :ulll . were driven from the shel-
tcrcil (iaidcll of 1 len, inst .ul‘ity has been the bane of
mankind." Mr. I istcin goes on farther to point out that
economic ltl cclli ly is the challenge confronting the twen-
' What is the answer? Social lnsurail

"Si 1 insurance aims at the maximum appli tion of
lhc [)l'lllt.1|ll‘ oi illsul'ancc ill the protection of workers
g inst 1 stunt insecurities." It may be described as a
relatively inexpensive form of insurance, borne by the
entire poplila c through the applic ion oi the principle of
compulsion, dc re justice ainl security to the
working innsscs and pcacc and economic stability of the
nation.

.\lr. Epstein very fairly shows bolll sides of the prob-
lem Ilirough his dl. iission of ti ‘ unlcnts of recent
cr it's. All of the arguments ng let industry pro-
vide the security for its \vurktls; socuil insurance is too

The iiladi-iplncy of private insurance, the illusion of

Ililclliplnynn-llt, I receive the :ltlrlltion oi the author. Mr.
lipxlcill lists the countries in which voluntary and rom-
plilsol‘y Inn-niploymcnl illsnrnnci- operate and compares
them.

()llirl‘ topics which Mr. lipstcin iliscuss uclildc: lil-

:'l~.t sickilcs , old age mid iin lidin pensions,
\Vlll'lx'lllLLllllll'ti rolllpeusalions, and subsidies for mothers
and children. Ill conclusion, Mr. Epstein states lllat there
can be no well-being for any society, whether it be capi-
tallst, or communist, without t't‘lltiolllit. curity. “A mm.
prchensive program of social insurance embracing uncul-
ploylncnt insurance, old age pi-iisions or insurance, health
insurance with both medical and cash beneﬁt and a
system of f'unily allowance which would clilliiila . child

method for the advanci'lllcnt of economic and social sc-

shows all sides of the problem. Each ch.i llcr is summar-
ized 'i4 y. This book is now used as a text book at Ohio

IJeLaura have been members of the
baseball squad for four years, and
