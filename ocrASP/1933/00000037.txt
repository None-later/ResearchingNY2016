AN l'IXl’l.;\.\';\'l‘l().\'

hi the concluding assembly of last year, it was an-
nount:cd that William Nelson. 'J-l, had he i appointed to
the position of managing editor of To ‘l-‘. ‘oi. 1-:
Views. This appointment was not explained .it tliv tinic,
.' id on account of that. ii certain iiiisuiidcrstiiiiding has
arisen.

Alinit'a Russ, '34, was :ippoiutcd to thc po'itiou of
managing editor by lllt' l').i.l .\'i.\\'s It: . (In ' '
lllt’ point system, it was llt‘t‘l‘a‘iil y for Miss Russ to resign
her position on tlu: hoard.

Upon consideration of other members of the staff. the
board could find no one outstanding person, who at that
time, had douc- t‘llllt'l' enouin work to nicrit tln- appoint-
ment, or had acquired siitl'icicnt experience to fill the
position. For ll:it reason, the board dccidcd to lt‘iH't‘ the
position \acant. ind divide the work among tlic other staff
Incinbci‘s. in art, .\‘tcws llonrd went so far :is to pl lgc
itsulf that Miss l\'tl,‘n would do no more work on 'l llli
STATE (.‘oi.I.i-.oi-‘. .\'i.\v.~' than her position as Senior Asso-
riatc editor would guarantee.

This. however, did not niict uitli the approval of the
Student L'ouncil, so lllt: council nauicd William Nelson,
'34, managing editor of llll' l‘).l~l .\'i-.\\'s llltitl'tl. The 1933
‘d felt that in making such an appointment, Student
Council was assuming too much power, especially in vicw
of llic fact that Ni-lsoti liad hcrcliiforc Iii-\‘ci' hcld :i lliisl‘
tioii on 'l'Iii-: News.

The matter. lllt orc, was laid liui'orc tlii~ l‘).l.l Mys-

of Student ('ouncil. \\'illiam Nelson will i‘i-laiii his |Hisi‘

WELCOME. FRESHMEN

Once again the administration, faculty, and students
of State college have welcomed a new class—the class of
1937. The various organizations of the College, the depart-
mental clubs. and religious organizations have conducted
receptions. teas, and meetings especially for the purpose of
becoming acquainted with the entering students.

Now ltas come the time for all students to get down to
real studying for the year. Seniors have assumed new
teaching duties in Milne High school. The juniors are
taking more advanced atid harder courses in education
and methods. The sophomores are undertaking new posi-
tions in extra-curricular activities. Just where. many
freshmen think, do we fit into this scheme of things? That
is a problem for each individual freshman to ﬁgure out for
himself.

In fact, each freshman is “on his own,‘ so to speak.
He now chooses for himself the friends with whom he
shall spend his spare time, the books he shall read, and
the hours he shall keep. Moderation, tolerance, and a
clear head here seem to be the prime virtues of a fresh-
man—moderation in the time spent on studies and recrea-
tion. ainl tolerance for other members of the group.

Tin-2 STATE COLLEGE News takes this opportunity to
welcome the freshmen and to wish each individual student
all the success possible in this newest field of conquest.

man who has saved his home town from being blown Into

He is taken up to London, entertained by royalty
invited to premiere performances at the most cxpt‘

gcnci'ous piir tribute for what he has done. In f: .
although he :i become a national figurc, he is really but
a puppet in the hands of featuri- sci-king Iii-wspxipcr Incn.

Finally. Charlie "ipes to his Ilistrcssi-d family in
