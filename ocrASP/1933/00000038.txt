Readjustnieiit to College life was the
principal topic of the message to the
freshmen by Miss Helen H. More-
latid, deaii of women, 011 Monday and
Tuesday in Page hall auditorium.

The freshmen were urged to be lib-
eral in their ideas of college life. They
were advised not to hold too closely
to the narrow scope of their former life
in high school and in family. New
acquaintances should be made and ex-
tra-curricular activities undertaken, but
not hastily, lest their hurried judgment
curb their later decisions and actions.
The freshmen were advised to regard
their instructors as trying to engage
the students’ interests in scholastic

work..

Dean Mort-land gave an additional
warning to the boys. Outiiunibered ap—
proximately foiir to one by the fem-
inine sex, they were advised to pro-
ceed cautiously witii any “come hitli»
er” UiJ( from State's women. The
possibility of acquiring aii inferiority
or superiority complex might prove a
liability to an enjoyable College ca-
reer, she adder .

Aii innovation this year was the
tuberculosis lL‘si to the incoming fresh-
men. Aitliougii the tvsts were not
piilsory, approximately two-tliir .
the freshman L ass took advantage
lllt' importunity. As a whole, the re-
siilts were reported favorable. The
positive results will be followed
later with x—ray photographs. Th
. s were given by the State Depart-
