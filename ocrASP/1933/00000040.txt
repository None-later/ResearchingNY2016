STU l )ISNT TAX

Last week the student asscinbly . .d the budget for
the year 1933-34. It was unusual that the appropriations
should be passed as a whole, for previous years it hail been
considered item by item in order to acquaint the freshmen
with the relative importance of the various activities. This
year it seems as though all the usual wrangling over each
activity, which really didn't accomplish much, has been
eliminated.

Now that the budget is through, roller
by members of the student board of liii

Last year the budget as a whole was cut considerably,
(hit: to the negligence of \ rioiis students who either did
not care enough about the activities at the College, or who
could not liatig onto the cash long though to iiiiilie the ucccs-

STATE COLLEGE NEWS, OCTOBER

A NEW TRADITION

The student association has recently added to the list of
College traditions, making the custom of singing “Life Is
Very Different" by the freshmen no longer a sophomore
rule, but now a lasting tradition. Previously there has
been a considerable fuss over this occasion, caused mostly
by the exaggerated power of enforcement on the part of
the sophomores, and a desire for resistance on the part
of many freshmen.

Tradition, however, is something more than mere play
on the part of a few individuals. It involves the cooperation
of the entire group. Traditions at State college are prac-
tices which have been handed down year by year, the re-
eiiacting of which should add something to one's own
vcneration toward the College, as well as group College
spirit. Recently it has been noted that many freshmen
have neglected to remove hiin school rings and insignia
of one type or another. The majority of these people
have understood, from the Freshman Handbook, mailed
during the summer, that such emblems should be retrieved,
and have certainly heard about the practice since, so there
can be no excuse for the lax members of the group.

lt is to be lamented that the members of the class of
937 have not as yet become sufﬁciently acclimated to the
College as to love and honor its traditions and to have
enough class spirit to want to stand together on this matter.
However, the class .will have an opportunity this morning
to appear as a united group in harmony with College
traditions.

LOUNGE OR STUDY ROOT“?

Again the old problem comes up about the Lounge oi
Richardson hall—whether or not students should be allowed
to study there.

in the first place, the Lounge was provided with the
intention that it should be used for social purposes only.
As soon as the comfortable furniture was installed, certain
people proceeded to study there, thus taking up space which
might otherwise be used by those who wanted to converse.
Last year Lounge committee patrolled the room with the in-
tention of eradicating such people. However, this system
iliil not work very well, because various members of the
committee were often too tiuiiil to enforce the rule.

This year the new library facilities ochr sufficient room
for all those who want to study. In spite of this, students
are again studying in the Lounge. 1t scents a shame, now
that people no longer have to study in the balls, that they
should persist in cluttering up the Lounge \\’1111 books and
papers.

Recognition should be made ()l Miss Stnltcs' gift of six
decks of playing cards. Magazines and books have been
contributed by the State college Co-op. The NI-lws will
also contribute to the reading matter by placing on file in
the Lounge :uiged newspapers from other colleges.

With all this the Lounge should be more attractive to
those who wish to use it for a social purpose. '1 he Ni-zws
recommends that all studying should be done in 1111‘ library
titll)’.

more cxpt net-d reporters. The story iitids its way into
lllt' Associated I‘ri-ss iiilicc, landing ,iiui the job as assistant
with the A1' at the State Capitol.

The book gives a clear picture of the rapidity with. which

the newspaper game moves. It not only demands instan-
