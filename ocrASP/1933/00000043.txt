 Above ISentirrIentality . . . -

Mrs. Barry. ‘By Frederick Niven. E. P.
Dutton R Co. 32.50

Kindliness and fortitude are so sei-
dom to be experienced in this world to-

' day, that to have them vividly brought

to us in the non. of Mrs. Barry is an
unforgettable pleasure. Mr. Niven has
written a touching. well modulated mas-
ter-piece in depicting the homely vicis-
situdes of a wanton of sim ie ntesns and
charitabie‘disposition.‘ S e lacks edu-
cation, but she possesses a fund of
knowledge of the things which are ac-
cured spontaneouslythrough the heart.
rather' than through the more prosiac

m n .

' With Mrs. Barry. we find her young
son. Neil. a fellow who would bring vea-
ation, heartache sud happiness to the
mother who wished to do so much for
him with so very little at her command.
He is superbly set down. His inquisi-
tiveness and untactfulness are truly boy-
liire and unheeding of the deep hurt
they bring to his mother. She accepts
his adolescent questioning and carries
it at? gracefully and shrewdly until the
danger is passed.

Mr. Niven does remarkably well in
keeping the story above sentimentality.
His style depends considerably on the
ﬁneness of his uac of dialogue and his
characters speak only for themselves.
He builds a story somewhat reminiscent
of the work of Katherine Mansﬁeld.
However. his quality goes deeper than
hers—he has, as' she had. a gift for ex-
tracting the essentials of a little episode
so that every word secures a worth and
richness of eﬁect seldom obtained in
literature. The loving kindness of Mrs.

tions of her neighbors. the youthful
vitality of Neil combine to form a work
pf ii? on which is grandiy close to life

0. '

Captain Willemae’a book is an account
of a life-time spent actively on the New
York City police force. Beginning
with the racy. u
author's voyage to America after his
running away from Holland. the book
continues swiftly and soon is taken up
by Captain Willemse's adventures and

famous ."Tenderloin" district of New
York's Bowery. »

The arduous steps upward toward the
detective bureau captaincy bring to the
author a host of intimate glimpses into
the sordid and gruesome lives of New
York‘s meaner, more unfortunate social
classes. The stories are bluntly told.
occasionally with a touch of sentimen-
tality; then again with pathos and even
with indignation.

His philosophy of life is expressed in
loamy phrases and one finds no deep
probin into causes and effects of the
fantastic people and events he sets down
for us in his rcportorial style. He pre-
sents his factual data and is quite con-
tent with that alone. The journalistic
tendency is marked because it is prob-
able the author has made extensive use
of~newspaper ﬁles to refresh his mem-
ory. Facetiously, one might say. “this
cop remembers" with the excellent aid
of police records and the friends he has

FROCES FOR CAMPUS WEAR

At the ri ht are shown two frocks that are particularly attrac-
tive for t e smart co-ed. togethervwlth a double-breasted cost
that is becoming the accepted thing on the leading coile e
and university campuses. 'The round, youthful looking yo e
on the ﬁrst frock gives the wearer a ﬂattering dropped-shoul-
decline. This frock is perfect in one fabric. and very dashing
with contrasts. The second is a simple frock that will carry
the smart co-ed through many informal engagements. it is
smart in plain or printed silk. The double-breasted coat shown
at the extreme right has droglped‘ehoulders and shaped sleeves
that give it a nonetulsnu t t is particularly attractive.
