STATE COLLEGE NEWS, OCTOBER

MUST THIS CONTINUE?

It is commonly said that there is no honor among
thieves. Whether this would apply to the light-ﬁngered
members of the student hotly is a matter of conjecture.
At any rate the “wee small voice” in several people has
not shouted loud enough to be heard.

The attractive lamp shade which covered the light
outside the College Co-operativc book store has re-
cently disappeared. Of course it might be the work of
archie, the roach—perhaps a form of tribute to inc-
hitabcl. On the other hand, it is more likely that some
absent-minded person stuck it into his pocket and
wandered blithely off with it.

Other things have strangely come up missing.
Books, formerly of good repute and quiet dispositioti,
have suddenly grown legs and waltsz o with a new
master. Various articles of clothing have sought new
backs to adorn. Perhaps the correct comment would
be that it is too bad that there isn't a better distribu-
tion of the beneﬁts of this strange power over lost
articles.

Wl-IY INTERRUI’T?

Some people seem to think it their hnuiidcn duty to
attend cacli assembly program, whether they intend to
stay only ﬁve minutes, or whether they merely waiit to
“rubber neck" on their way through to Milne High school.
If these people are really so curious as to what manner
of person might be addressing the assembly, ve suggest
that they get thctnsclvcs stcpladtlers by which they might
examine the speaker from any of the windows.

Not only is this old State college custom annoying to
the person who might be trying to address the student
body, but it i so sottiL‘tltttcs more annoying to the stu-
dents tlicmsclrLs—tspecially thusc' who sit in the rear of
the auditorium.

Especially with this nice wcatlier, it seems a bit of a
shamc that practice tcaclicrs should not avail themselves
of the opportunity of getting a bit of sunshine before
cntcring Milne High school.

“Will Campus Queen Be Blonde or Brunette?”
Ceremonies Tomorrow Night To Reveal Answer

Do gentlemen prefer blondcs,——or does the male element of State college
disagree with Anita Loos' famous aphorism? Will the eleventh Campus Queen
bc a seventh bloiidc sovereign or will the coronation ceremonies reveal a ruler
with brunette trcsscs? These questions have been predominant in undergraduate

conversations during the wcck.

lhe answers will be forthcoming tomorrow

night at the traditional Campus Day activities in Page hall auditorium.

Popularity and participation in ex-
tra-curricnlar activities have become
criteria of equal rank with beauty aml
charm in the annual selection of the
Campus Queen. Four of the candidates
this year are members of Mys aiiia,
senior honorary society. One is presi«
dent of the Young Women’s Christian
association, another is College song
leader, and a third is president of Inter-
sururity council. The “Prom Queen"
chosen by the class of 1934 last year
was nominated by the junior class. All
are members of sororities.

Seven of the Campus rulers have
been bloiides, three have been bru—
iiettcs, and one, titian. Two of the
nominees this year are liloudes, while
the remaining three of the group of
candidates are brunettes.

ampus day was ﬁrst celebrated at
State college in 1920. The idea of a
sovereign to rule over Campus day was
not introduced until 1922. Ethel Rush,
'23, tltc ﬁrst to preside over Carri-
piis day activities.

PROFESSOR FINDS
NEW FLY SPECIES

Dr. Scotland Discovers New Genus
During Graduate Research
on "Lemna Minor"

    

 

 

lntcrcst in thc ﬁcld of biology was
greatly augmented this summer when
Dr. Minnie ll. Scotland, professor of
biology, discovered a new genus of fly.
l)r. Scotland made this discovery
while completing work for the degree
of doctor of entomology at Cornell
university.

'l‘lic lltlc of hcr thesis was “The Airi-
mal Population of l.ciima Minor."
l.cmn:i is one of the srnallcst aquatic
llowcring plants, and goes by the com-
mon names of ilticlott'ccil, duck's nit-at,
and water Icnlil. This plan, to hcr
kiiowlcdgc, has never liccii worked on
hcforc, although lzii'gc aqtu ic plants
have been studied for their animal pop-
ulation.

“It was ill August," said Dr. Scot—
land “tliat I found the new gclius and
slit-cits while scorching for thc dimiuu<
tivi: animal lifc that atta ' or imikcs
use of thc duck-ward. As far as I have
hccu llltlL‘ to t ...ovcr, this ucw Ily .‘
more clost-ly coiiucctcd with tho plant
than any othcr forms, and spcuds its
t'lllll't’ lilc cycle from egg to adult upon
it. It is also probable that it is only
found upon l.cinna Minor."
