THE BOOK OF THE WEEK

Comic Bohemia...

The Fault of Angels.
per & Brothers. $2.50

This year's Harper Prize Novel is a light and
genial comedy. an odd but able successor to the
volumes that have preceded it in the past five
years. Its theme is built around a group of
literary and musical esthetcs living against the
background of a middle sized American city
whose richest citizan is determined to make cul-
ture bow before the magic of his check book.
With deft satire Paul Horgan builds up his
comed , avoiding a direct treatment of the rela-
tion oflthe artist to American society, content-
ing himself with the presentation of thc‘char-
actcrs in their strange and self-contained world.

Rochester. New York. is the thinly disguised
background of the story, and the late George
Eastman is suggested in the character of Henry
Ganson, whose fortune is the magnet which has
drawn together most of the characters of the
book. Paul Horgan can write of this with nu-
thorlty, for he studied at the Eastman School
of Music, and spent three years as painter and
scene designer with the Rochester American
Opera company. However. the relations to
reality are of slight account in this novel, for
it moves along with a cheerful disregard for the
exactitudes a reality, either in character or in
background. The art of overstatement is a ﬁne
one. but. for the most part. the author has mas-
tered it. and has succeeded in giving life and
color to a set of characters who are absurdly un-
real in many way
As the book op

By Paul Horgan. Har-

s.
ens the art world of Dorchcs-

 

ter has attained its maximum degree of stabil-
ity and balance, but with the advent of Nina,
wife of the newly hired Russian conductor. all
semblance of order vanishes. Possessed of am-
bition. which Alexander Pope has called "the
fault of angels and of fools", Nina sets out.
girdcd in the impenetrable armor of simplicity,
to do battle with the worldly elements of Dar-
cbester life. For Nina there are no small be-
ginnings; the omnipotent Mr. Gannon is the ob-
‘cct of her ﬁrst scige, for she contemplates mak-
Ing of him an American Tolstoi whose message.
backed by the authority of his bank balance.
shall go ringing through the wilderness of ma-
terialism.

Weeping. smiling. pleading she disarranges
the lives of the whole artistic melangs in Dar-
chester. Charmineg she steps into their love
affairs. sweetly she drags out the skeletons in
their closets. ruthlessly she upsets the even
tenor of their ways, and when she leaves her
friends are many, thou h she converts few.

Nina is undou tcdly Sic able-st portrait in the
book, though there are many other: who are
drawn with fine skill, for Paul Horgan is adept
at ﬁnding the
neatly sum up t e externals of character. Per-
haps the chief fault of the book lies in the fact
that it is so exclusively devoted to the exteriors
and surfaces of the scene. Brightly, even bril-
liantly painted, the personages of The Fault of
Ange a lack depth and warmth. and are some-
times dangerously close to caricature. How-
ever, this flaw is more than compensated for by
the many moments of high comedy that en-
liven the pages of the book.
