water, working feverishly under terriﬁc pressure
—no place for a nervous man! That’s why a diver’s
nerves must always be in perfect condition. And
that’s why I smoke Camels imd have smoked them
for years. They are a milder cigarette and they
taste better. But more important than that to me—
they never upset my nervous system.”

THE SIDE LINE

Just a bit of the inside dope, folks,
to let you know what's what in sports
on the campus.

I see by the tournament card that
a few of the net-men have reached
the quarter-ﬁnals. The lucky rac-
quetcers are Red Decker, the Hud-
son ace, Barney Oldﬁeld, a home-
town product, Bud Kissam, the Long
Island ﬂash, and Rug Bancroft, pride
of the southern tier. The tennis man-
ager expects to see the tournament
ﬁnished before Christmas. (The
winner receives a mahogany Yule-
Log.)

Listen to this! Tomorrow the men
of the College are going to indulge in
a game of soccer. lletter drop around
and get an eyeful of this unprecedented
event, The girls are i n scheduled for
a similar set-to. iig will follow
in the Page hall gymnasium at approxi-
mately 10 o'clock.

Coach Baker has issued the ﬁrst
call for basketball. The aspirants
are due in the Page hall gym at 4
o'clock next Monday. The season‘s
opener will be played on December
9. Drew college is the unlucky op-
ponent, unlueky inasmuch as the
State team lost but two varsity play-
ers last June—Harris and DeLaura.

'will publish it in the next issue.

 

EDWARD COOPER
WRITES ARTICLE
0N BOOKKEEPING

“Comparative Merits of Single and
Double Periods iii Bookkeeping" is the
subject for an article published in thc
September number of the Iliiluiirr Slice!
and written by Edward C. Cooper, iii-
structur of commerce. The article is
an excerpt from his master's thesis for
which he received his degree at the Uni-
versity of Ohio in 1931.

In the middle west, as in some places
farther east, double periods of book-
keeping :irc used in secondary schools.
The article iroves that there is no
justification Eur using these, and that
single periods are just as effective. To
quote from his writing: “The examin-
ation results indicate that the factor of
single period or double period is not
an important factor. Since the double
period plan of instruction requires
twice as much teaching time and twice
as much teaching equipment, the use
of the donlile period is not justified."
The statistics for the study were taken
from the "Commercial 3 ' nl
Survey" made by the \\'hitewnler State
'l'cnclirrs' college in l9. .
