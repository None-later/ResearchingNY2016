Varied Program by Angna Enters
Will Begin at 8:30 o'clock
in Page Auditorium

The dramatics and art council will
present Anglia Iiuters in her “Episodes
ainl Compositions in Dance Form"
'l‘hnrsday night at 8:30 o'clock in the
auditorium of Page hall. Miss Enters
is considered America's greatest dance
tniinc.

Miss Enters brings to State college
an evening of entertainment, utilizing
an interrelated sense of tragedy, high
comedy and nioderti dramatic design.
She designs and executes her own cos-
tumes, and creates her dances and the
intisic for them. She takes her audi-
ence through an original range of ferti-
inine emotions—satire, and pure fun,
with delicacy, voluptuous wit, and a
refreshing Simplicity.

A wide variety of Iier program is
shown in Iier mclustnn of German,
lire-ck, hpiilllﬁll, French, Russian, and
I'.iigI|sII compositions. I'lcr critics say
of her "I Iiat she is a dancer is deiti-
onstrated plainly enough in sortie of
the things ’llt' does, hut he s' is not a
dance e taitiinent. It is essentially
ilrainat ‘. IIer knowledge of drawing
and painting is revealed over and over
iii the scheme of her movements and
her selection of colors. But above all
else shim-s forth the hriIliance of a
miinl rich iii fancy and rising to heights
of geiitiiiie imagination. Her entertain-

mges lroin Ininior to tragedy and

' . . poetic. And it is the perfec-
tion of reﬁnement."

senting student tax cards or ﬁfty cents
