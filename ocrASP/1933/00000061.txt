STATE COLLEGE NEWS, NOVEMBER 3, 1933

 

THE SIDE LINE

At a recent meeting of the men’s
athletic council two important appoint-
ments were made. Harry Yaffee was
named manager of varsity tennis, and
Al Jadick, Beacon's Bad Boy, was
awarded the tnanagership of intra-
mural athletics. lncideutally, Al put
on a peachy intro-mural program last
year and promises a better slate for
the '33-'34 season.

The fracas which you might have
witnessed on the \Vestern avenue catn-
pus last Saturday was what Sluefoot
would call socball. The game ended
in a tie—the frosh scoring one soccer
goal and the sophs tallying one foot-
hall goal. The most thrilling event of
the afternoon was "GS" Bancroft‘s
successfully attempted deflation act.
Unprecedented, I say, unprecedented.

Monday night, in answer to the ﬁrst
call for varsity and froslt basketball,
about thirty men cluttered up the gym.
According to the expectations of your
columnist (apologies to \Vinchell), the
varsity looked a bit rusty aml the fresh
should be in the auditorium on Thurs-
day evening to get a few tips front
Angna Enters.

co-Op HAUNTS

Hallowe’en always brings to mind
associations with haunted things. The
quest for thrilling adventure is often
satisﬁed by "spooky" parties and dar-
ittg journeys through weird places.

These haunts are but passing events
which leave few constructive imprints
upon our minds. However, the stu-
dents of State college ttow have the
opportunity to satisfy their desire for
haunting experiences by visiting the
cozy nook called "The Haunted Book-
shop" in a corner of the College co-op-
erative book store. Matty a pleasant
hour can be spent there in reading the
best works in literature, and each one
may choose his favorite “literary
haunt" front the well-ﬁlled shelves of
the Co-op‘s contribution to our perma-
nent “Literary Hallowe'en".
