The key to the sittiatiott so far \l'l‘llls to l‘t'al lit the

given the opportunity.

The power to aid ill tltr cultural advancement of these
students rt-sis.t1tt-rivfori. within the student association. it
seems absurd that sin-h an opportunity shotild be lost
simply on account of one activity. if lllt'ht‘ students should

 

   

 

be admitted into otir association, then they would be
enabled to attcttd all concerts attd presentations of the
various councils. After all, the plight of these people is
rather unfortunate. All of these students, if times were
better. would ttow be enrolled itt various colleges iiiroitglv
out the country. Many of these students will, in June.
transfer to other colleges and thus carry with them regular
college credit for courses taken while here. More than
that, all Junior college students who maintain a B average
thi car will be eligible for admittance ittto tltc sophomore
class iii September.

Especially in view of the fact that Junior college will
be functioning for one year only. there is no reason why
State college should not l)L‘ gracious enough to wclcumc

“Education makes its bttrn all the more with dis-

The purpose of the boolt is to show "that views

pond to a very large extent upon the way the social
scene as a whole is contemplated." .\lr. \‘oelfel does
this through study of the rottti-tttpitrary social change.
all analy i‘ and interpretive criticism of viewpoints of
seventeen modern educators. and finally tltrotiglt a con-
s'idcration of the modernized aims of education.
