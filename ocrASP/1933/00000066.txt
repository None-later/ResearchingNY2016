Sharp Yer Gentle . . .
but of 'My‘Head. .By Margaret

Fishbacir. E. P. Dutton & Com- 5

puny,” Inc. I 32.00.

’ The so delightful author of one
of-laat'..year’s.best sellers “1 Feel
Better. Now” has favored her pub-

: lie with another book of refres -

ing. lively verse. Miss Fishbaclt,
who lives in New Yorlt City, has
gathered an abundance of experi-
ence from every day observations
which she incorporates in her
light. rippling lines. She has. a
capacity for taking the prosalc'm-
cidents occurring in that pulsating
metropolis. and delicately tearing
them apart with gloved hands.
Although her criticism is never ve-
hement, nothing escapes her
shrewdness. Taxicabs and spar-
rows, men and vegetables, all re—
ceive their due from the sharp yet
gentle pen of Miss Fishback. Her

,v style and type of poetry is similar

to that of Samuel Hoﬁenstein’s
but where the latter refuses to
make a detour, Miss Fishback
treats euphemistically the many-
sided life that whirs about her.

The author came to R. H. Macy
& Company, New York depart—
ment store, after graduating from
Goucher College, Baltimore, in
1927.

Her brittle verses and sly ﬁrst
person paragraphs made merchan-
dising for the ﬁrst time gay, per-
meating the business of selling po-
tato mashers. canaries, and riding
habits with puck-like humor.
Miss Fishback is now a high-
salaried copy Writer, a contributor
to current magazines, and the au-

ATravellng Professor . 

Reggie-Taggle. By Dr. Walter
tarkie. E. ,P. Dutton & Com-
pany.‘ Inc. $3.00.
So rarely are we given an op.
portunity to pry into the private
lives of our college professors that
we should consider this charming
novel of travel brought to us by
Dr. Walter Starkie, professor of
Spanish at the University of Dub-
lin, an invigorating experience.
In Raggle-Taggle. an erudite man
of letters doffs his pedagogical
trimmings and sets out with a ﬁd-
dle and a camera on an audacious
tramp through the rougher re
gions of the Balkan countries.
From its beginning this fascinat-
ing tale is one continuous enter-
tainment, expounding adventure
after adventure among the dark-
skinned. musical vagabonds of
Europe’s gypsy clans. It is most
amusing to see our pedant brush-
ing elbows with the more truculent
half of life, as well as with the
dusky female species whose ad-
vances he passes of? with tactful
gentleness, always taking his ro—
mance with a grain of salt and
never once forgetting his station in
life. We follow this troubadour
and his disguise, waiting for him
to betray himself and his vocation
and we are not at all surprised to
catch him meditating upon the
companions of Xenophon whenhe
comes upon the shores of Lake
Balation.

After reading this pleasant book
of travel you will be more prone
to appreciate the latent qualities,
and feel more kindly towards the
sometimes stern. dogmatical fig-
ure on the rostrum in your lecture
