It’s no place for jangled nerves—
this game called polo. Listen to
Cecil Smith, one of America’s
ﬁnest players:

“Polo makes continuous de-
mands on your nervous system. A
fraction of a second determines
whether or not you can success-
fully ride your opponent out of a
play and a fraction of an inch in
your aim when going full gallop
may mean the difference of a goal

national polo takes years of prac-

CECIL SMITH, DIE of “I! HlGHEST-WKING polo players in
the world, and sensational star of the recent open'eham-

Try Camels yourself. You'll like

the fact that you can smoke as
