 Curse of the Wise Women.
By Lord Dunsany. Longmans.
Green & Co.

UStory tellers are rare and. with
the sole exception of David Gar-
nett.,".there is no one so able as
Lord Dunsany in the narration of
a fanciful tale. In this book, os-

. .tensibly a romantic tale of Ireland,
the author weaves a sublimely
moving story of a witch-woman,

Mrs. Marlin. who dominates the

scene in which Charles Peridore

acts.

After the sudden escape of his
father. the‘ victim of political in-
trigue, we ﬁnd Charles hunting
upon the wild bogs of the country-
side in the company of the restless
Torn Marlin. son of the witch-
woman. A peat development com-
pany takes an option to exploit
the bog in a fuel manufacturing

pendeavor. It is in this particular
situation that the witch-woman
acts in a desperate eﬂ'ort to save
the country from the dispoiling
methods of the new enterprise.

The story concludes with a dra-

matic event of utmost intensity

and the countryside is again free
and immune from the schemes of
men.

Lord Dunsany secures eﬁ'ects of
sheerest beauty by his constant
use of detailed. natural imagery.
His style enables him to achieve
a great clarity even in the difﬁcult
matter of the mysticism and su-
pernatural visions of the witch-
woman and her doomed son. ,The
effect upon the reader is instanta-
neous and lasting.

The Colonel‘s Children . .

Worth Remembering. By_Rhys r

gmes. Longmans. Green and Co.
.00.

How far the adult has traveled
on the way of life since childhood
is always poignantly brought
home to'ul whenever we read so
excellent a story as that of the
Colonel’s children. There are
three of them, all under the care
of the most entertaining Mammy
there ever could be. and it is she

who provides the pathos and zest

in her lovingly abusive handling
of these refractory "chillun". The
locale might be any southern town
and the phrases of the youngsters
are largely composed of the rich,
picturesque language of the Negro.

The rampant. unconventional
nature of these impish terrors is
too much for the Colonel and it is
most amusing to see them making
excellent sport of his elevated,
stiff lectures on good behavior.
We are regretful when the host of
adventures ends. at long last, with
the children being sent away to
school.

Rhys James' use of the Negro
dialect is superb. His story has
tang and originality. It is a merry
tale in an unusual vein and never
loses the feeling for childhood or
its stormy. fun. He returns us to
a land we had long lost and so re-
stores a hearty glow we had not
felt for so very long a time.
