“Camels never give me edgy nerves even when

LISTEN TO MARY WIGGINS, greatest of all girl

that one cigarette  different from the others!
She says:

“I have to be §u_re my nerves are healthy to
do my stunts, changing from a speeding auto

walking while up in a plane, and the high-
altitude parachute jump. As to smoking, I’ve
found that Camels don’t interfere with healthy
nerves. I've tried all the brands. Camels are
