"To rescue an unsightly old wreck.

has been interested iit making articles
by hand. Since he began teaching, this

its outlet iii the repairing and restoring

He has studied the histories of fant-

collected models of old types with mod-

these live again. In speaking of the

"To ﬁle out accurately an escapement

Tinting ol Ancient

most famous timepieces of America;
just what Silas Hoatlly. Eli Terry,
Seth Thomas. Riley Whiting. and other
early pioneers iii the Connecticut clock
industry were doing over a hundred
years ago." .

Not only is Professor Stinard inter-
ested in their mechanical and historical
aspects. but lie feels, moreover, the per-
sonality of clocks—lite mystic speech
of their tick-tacks. Mr. Stinard says:

“When you have your clock restored
—what a companion it is to you! It is
like a voice front the past trying to
tell you the events it Itas seen. It sug-
gests the generations that have come
and gone since it began its career, and
the many others it will witness after
you are gone. if some kind and sym-
pathetic friend will give it a little care."

LOMAX PRESENTS
BALLADS PROGRAM

John Lomax and Son Allen Relate
Experiences in 11:10 Assembly
Friday Morning

 

Once again John Lomax spoke to a
State college audience durittg the 11 :10
* ntbly last Friday. Mr. Lomax, who
u introduced by Dr. Harold W.
Thompson, professor of English, is
widely known in American colleges as
a great scholar and as the man who
started the whole country collecting iii-
digenous and beautiful folk literature.
I'Ie toltl of his travels, accompanied
son, Allati, through four south-
: ates, searching for the words and
music of negro songs not yet contain-
inated by white influence. Isle visited
negro prison camps. interviewing over
10,000 blacks, because he believed this
would give him :ttt opportunity to get
directly to the negro himself. Lomax
and Itis son searched mainly for the
“reals”. the ﬁlled sinful songs of
tltc colored race.

Allan Lomax, recently a student at
Harvard university, tnade his ﬁrst ap-
pearance in public when Ite sang some
of these negro ballads for the student
assembly. Among them were "Long
John", the tale of it fast running negro,
and “Honey. Take a \VltifT on Me", a
cocaine song. At the request of his
father Itc sang “lilack lietty" aitd
“(ireat fiotl Almighty".

As a result of last summer's travels,
over 200 new tunes have been ﬁled in
the Library of Congress. They will
constitute the ﬁrst third of Mr. Lo-
utax‘s book. “Iiall' and Folk Songs
of Ameri ". l)r. Ihompsou will write
the bibliography for this book, which
will be published next January.
