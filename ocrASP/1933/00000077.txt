STATE COLLEGE NEWS. NOVEMBER 24, 1933

INTERNATIONAL DEBATE

National Student Federation of America is again
making arrangements for another international debate
this year. A team representing State college will meet
another team, representatives of King's college, Lott-
dou, tonight iii the auditorium of Page hall. The ques—
lion for discussion is one which sltotild he of interest
to all students.
otts, as the saying goes, :trc lasting.
,siou the British debaters tvill get of
State college as a whole will be through the size. of the
audience.

The Debate Council especially asks the cooperation
of the student body in making this event a success.

Credit should be given to the Edward Eldred Potter
elttll for taking the initial steps in the entertainment of
prominent guests of State college. State college is duly
honored by the presence of these distinguished guests.

 

JANITORIAL SERVICE

For the last few weeks, it has been the custottt of the
janitor at 7:00 o'clock to lock all doors ill Draper llall
except the grade door next to the Co-op. Of course,
the library is open front 7:00 to 0:30 o'clock four nights
during the week. Many students tvltrt sttidy ill the
libra " do ttot care to be encumbered by overeoat’ and
rttbhe . If at least one door. the one on the t ts eIl
Draper ball. were open, students could leave their
IIticles iii the locker roout. .

l.I'|sl‘\\’L't:l(, :l lll'L' was started in the men's loci ‘
roont ot Draper hall. Luckily, tilt tipperitlass‘iliau dis-
covered and extinguished it before it spread. It had
been ,s arti-Il by a Junior college student who had used
match . to see ltis way arottttd the loiker room. It
the lights had been left on longer, such an occurrence
would not have happened. 'l'hvri-fort', Itot oitly lot“ the
t‘lleL‘lllt‘lH‘t‘ of tltc sttidi'llts‘, bill for the safety ot thi-
building, we would suggest that the lights he left
