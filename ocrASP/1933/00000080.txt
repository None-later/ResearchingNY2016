. brilliant and soft effect. But
" biographer. except for an ex-
‘e‘ssive use of the haclmeyed mod-
" which uses the im-
nation and probable conversa-
"on of the persons and the period
.. rtrayed to heighten the effect,
allows a pedestrian route and
Birely catches the ﬂeetness or
gayety of Viennese life in the
time of the Straus waltz masters.
.. Mr. Ewen begins with a compre-
hensive account of the rise to
fame of the elder Johann Straus.
His dry, even narration of the
shoddy home life of the musician
convinces us that the man who
was to be the father of the master
.of light music was a hero only in
the midst of the turbulent cafe
life. To his wife. the elder Strauss
was an ungrateful husband with-
out regard for the care of his chil-
dren.

There is a pathetic truthfulness
in the account of the abandoned
'wife's courageous efforts to secure
a musical education for her child,

Johann. who at an early age gives
excellent promise of becoming as
sure a musician as his worldly
father. He has his triumph in
IBM when he succeeds in swav-
mg Vienna more than had his
father in his debut eighteen years
before. Son is like father in many
respects but he never forgets the
debt he owes to the self-sacriﬁc-
rng mother who is at once the
most human and the most herioc
person in the biography. Mr.
Ewen presents the contemporary
life of the musician very factually;
he considers the European tours
of both the Strauss’ and gives a
full. account of the triumph
achieved by the younger Straus

in his American visit to Phila-

delphia.

The biography never penetrates
but flows along at a regular, un-
accented rate over the surface of
Vienesse life like the music of the
carefree fellows it portrays. Here
biography and character go hand
in hand without serious thought
or effect. The book is another
biography‘ of a minor ﬁgure in
musical istory: Mr. Ewen can-
not be ex ected to create a mas-
ter-piece or he lacks original ma-
terial, the Strauss’ were not men
of musical stature. the events in
their lives, with a few momentary
triumphs are not the material
upon which one can successfully
lose a serious biography.
