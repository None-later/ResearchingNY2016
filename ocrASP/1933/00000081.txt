' CAMEES

 

EDDIE WOODS, one of the “top hands” of the
cowboy world, says:

“Ten seconds on the back of an outlaw horse
is about the hardest punishment for a man’s
nerves that anybody can imagine. To have nerves
that can take it, I smoke only Camels. I’ve tried
them all, but Camels are m smoke! They have
a natural mildness, and I like their taste better.
Most important of all, Camels do not jangle my
nerves, even when I light up one Camel after
another.”

 

 

it! it! lit

If y0_u are nervous...jumpy... inclined to “ﬂy
off the handle”...change to Camels. Your own
nerves and taste will conﬁrm the fact that this
milder cigarette. made from costlier tobaccos, is
better for steady smoking.

Ill)! 'EI MIDI! Every second is crowded with
danger for Eddie Woods, twice all-round cow-
boy champion at the famous Calgary Stampede.
It sure takes healthy nerves to stay on board a
ﬁghting bronk! “ Camels are my smoke,
Eddie Woods. “They never jangle my nerves."

 

 

" says

IT I_§ MORE FUN TO KNOW

Camels are made from ﬁner,
MORE EXPENSIVE tobacco:
than any other popular brand.

 

 

 

“OUT 0" I’ll! MIMI I became
devoted to riding and smoking
Camels. Even if 1 am not in
the championship class I need
healthy nerves. And Camels do
not upset my nerves. They are
J, the mildcu cigarette I know!"

  
  
   
   

 

  
 
   
   
   
   
   
 
 
 
 
 
  
  
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 

 
 

 

 

THE SIDE LINE

“Bungy” Ingraham, the Genial

 

 

 

Gentleman from the Southern Tier, ‘

is rapidly recovering from the mls-l

fortune he suffered in the ﬁrst hoop ‘
scrimmage of the season. It seems
too bad that "Bungy‘s" court record
(length) should be thwarted after
such gigantic efforts.

"Sparky" Bancroft is also recov-
ering from a slight (llSlUCillinli——i|§
usual.

I think the Fresh must have taken
that Angna Enters tip. An improve-
ment seems to have marked their
practice sessions.

I say, Al, where is that iutru-qurzil
program?

Coach Baker's Snowbirds con-
ducted their initial frolic on the
campus on Friday and are looking
forward to another this week.
