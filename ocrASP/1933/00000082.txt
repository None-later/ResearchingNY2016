A person who deliberately culti-
vates an acquaintance with a faculty
member in the hope of raising his
grade is just as dishonest intellectually
as the man who cribs," Paul II. Sheats,

‘ taiit instructor in government,
. d at the ﬁrst of a series of Iii-weekly
meetings of the Young Men's Christian
association on Sunday afternoon in the
Lounge of Richardson hall. “However,
I would prefer to rim the chance of a
few handshakes getting by for the slit
n a better faculty-student relation-
ship." Mr. Sheats added.

The topic of college morals was
chosen for disctissioii by the committee
because it felt that before talking about
the part which the \’..\l.C.A. will play
in sol\iiig the world's problems, it is
important to discuss the attitude on
matters of personal and social import-
ance on the Campus.

.\|r. Slit-Ills pointed out some of the
situations in which an nppnrtiiiiity is

such as the cheating or crilihiiig on
exams, quizzes, plagiarizing other
