SEASON OPENS TONIGHT

Basketball is again in the limelight. Jn fact, the varsity
will play its ﬁrst game with Drew tonight. The team is
expecting the co—operaiion of the student body with refer—
ence to correct conduct at the game. Students are also
asked to come in time for the event as well as for the
dancing.

The athletics department is attempting to attain and
establish desirable intervcollcgiatc standing which is prac-
tically impossible without the whole-hearted backing of the
students. The council is arranging games with larger col-
leges and universities. In order to show that we are
worthy of such recognition, the team as well as the stu-
deut hotly, should be at its best.

Anthony Adverse, by l-lervey Allen. Farrar and
Riuehart. l,224 pages. $3.00.

France. Italy, Africa, and America, all contribute
to the. setting of this momentous novel. In fact, it is
a panorama of latter eighteenth and early nineteenth
century manners, customs, and morals. Its authen-
ticity shows the great amount of research llervey
Allen must have done in order to complete such a hook.

The book is written in thc form of a biographv of
Anthony Adverse, an illegitimate child who is ist
off by his foster-father and brought tip by the great
merchant llounylcathcr. He serves his apprenticeship
and finally comes to his own through inheritance of
Mr. Ilonnyfcathcr's estate.

The author creates an excellent background, both
mental and geographical. for every move Anthony
niul s. 'l‘ln'ough an e ccllcnt cha icter portrayal, we
stiller \\’llll .-\uthoi his succh are ours. and his
emotional rc: 'hons ours. More than that, I'Icrvcv
.r\l|cu weaves into the tale adventures and cxpci'ienc ‘
which give us an adequate picture of the times. It '
a tale of birth. of I lvcttlttt‘e, of physical pawion.
of travel in lllt' .' an clipper ships, and ahovc all,
of romance.

Mr. Alli-It's style is free and the story is easy to
follow. llis (IL L‘l't|)ltt'll.~ are c cut. I'Iis use of co-
nicnlcuci-s is actually convincing. It is certainly the
type of book which. when once started. can hardly be
put down Iiutil completed. Its popularity will possibly
make It the best lovcil book of our time. It has already
become the hcst—scllcr.
