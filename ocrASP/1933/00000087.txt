BOOKZOF THE WEEK ‘

 

One Eye Westward . . .

Tomorrow Never Comes. By Wal-
ter Gilkyson. Sears Publishing
Company, Inc. $2.00. ‘

There has bej'sn a tendency
among certain authors to produce
plays and novels'with a particular
view toward their ultimate adop-
tion as material for motion picture
production. Mr. Gilkyson’s novel
unquestionably has the situation
and characters most suitable for
use in scenario form. The Free-
monts are the people concerned.
Martin Freemont is a successful
young lawer about to begin a po-
litical career which is to see him
chosen as-the Republican candi-
date for Congress. His wife is the
daughter. oddly enough. of
woman whose selection by the
Democratic party as candidate to
oppose Martin Freemont compli-
cates the novelist's plot to such an
e tent that it needs the entrance
into the story of a complete gang-
land set-up to clear the way for
the eventual triumph of young
Freemont. .

The story has speed, tenseness
and a fair love interest centered
around the gradual accptance by
Catharine. Martin's wife. of his am-
bitions as a politician. The ac-
count of her growing faith in the
ability and justiﬁcation of her hus-

 

the novel which is most interest-
ing. The evolution of the love of
Catharine for Martin and the les-
sening of her regard for her ruth-
less, sacrosant mother are both

given to us convincingly. The r- "

trait of the mother, Florence il-
let Carmichael, succeeds remark-
ably. She is a grasping. hypocrit-
ical woman. ca able of any actions
which might urther her own in-
terests. The helplessness of her
husband in the face of her “holy
crusade" is pathetic.

Were it not for the occasional
entrance into the novel of the ste-
reotyped melodrama we have seen
so often on the American screen.
Mr. Gilkyson‘s novel would ap-
proach high quality. His prose is

a unﬁowered, simple and direct. It

has the matter of fact tempo of its
characters. Perhaps it is the most
suitable fashion in which to
achieve successful presentation of
middle class people. but it is not
even remotely capable of the en-
grossing effect of the style of Sin-
clair Lewis. Mr. Gilkyson has
made a great potential story for
Hollywood but he has sacriﬁed
quality in the attempt: He is an
able writer. but he has obviously
created a story for a deﬁnite mar-
ket and his work is stamped with
all the limits and defects of that
market. He gives a shallow result
where he had an opportunity to

band is excellently'conveyed to us‘create several characters of more
by the author. It is this phase of than passing interest.
