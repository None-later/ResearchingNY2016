State Varsity Appears Conﬁdent
Of Victory in Tomorrow's
Court Encounter

The State college varsity basket-

othcr victory to its 'tirly season clean
slate when it I: s the strong Seth
Low college from the metropolitan
district tomorrow night in the gym-
nasium of I’agc hall at 8:31) o'clock.

Last year the I’nrple and (fold suf-
fercd two defeats at the hands of the
Seth Low outfit in two clos ' con»
tested games, losing by than
nine points in each encounter. The
two Seth |.ow set-Iv ‘ aiitl one

were lIII' only tlt'f .
last season's schedule.

L'oat'h llakcr stated in an inter-
view today that he would probably
use the same system of plays and
utiliration of the total squad of play~
t-i's in the game tomorrow night.

Roger ltiiivi’oft, '3-i. captain, l'lilll-
Iiit'lllt'll that the team "in no way
entertains a complex because of last
season's trtiunvings by the Seth |.o\v
quititrl." "Anyone with common
sense," llaiivroft furtlit-r commented
on last year's defeat, “can easily llll-
dcrsttind iii the morale of |ll_\' ti-aoi
