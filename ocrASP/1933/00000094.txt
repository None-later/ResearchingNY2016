Oii the other hand, students have offered the excuse that
they have not looked iii the student mail-box often enough
to know when such notices .trc placed there. it is a matter
of importance to every Senior whether or not he gets a
position. One would think. therefore. that each Senior
would have ciiotigli personal responsibility to keep on the
watch for notices from the appointment bureau and
promptly atteittl to them.

Shark! Sharkl. by Captain \Viiiiant E. Young as
told to Horace S. Mazet, 1“.R.G.S. Gotham House,
New York. 287 page. . .0 .

“A shark," Captain Young tells us, “is a muscular
marvel. l‘rcdatory. fitted to be ever hungry, roving.
rcluntlcss. a shark itcvcr slcci never lets up his ccasc-
less swimming through the sc from the iitititite he is
born, ltc must keep that great tail moving, tins fannitig.
anti his ugly face constantly on watch for food.”

Captain Young goes on to discredit the popular
superstition that sharks follow ships when there is
someone sick aboard. iii hopes of getting the dead body.
Very scldont do cadavers meet such a fate. for the
bodies are wrapped tightly iii canvas and weighted so
they will sink rapidly to the bottom. The descent is
thus so sudden that the shark doesn't have an oppor-
tniiily to attack. A shark might. however, follow a ship
for days simply to devour what refuse is thrown over--
boari .

Captain Young also discredits the theory that the
octopus .s the shark’s worst county. The ,sawlislt is more
deadly because with his saw-like bcak he can actually
pie :t the hide tif lllL' grt-at li
The book contains many 0. ting adventures with
those ferocious relatives of .\ltil)y Dick Captain Ynting
includes stories about all kinds of .s‘liar .s': small ones,
large mics, young ones, aittl old mics.

Unt- interesting feature. besides the rover hall botintl
lIl rral shark lIiiic, is the many pope" atitl drawings by
llt'lt'lt Scwcll. Captain Young also includes .s'tiuu: grttc-
Milllt‘ pictiir showing shark liitcs antl bruises on lItI-
man bodies. and photographs of sharks itt rapture.

"Tia-y say Macbeth ctnbczzlctl funds, the
