TO BE THE CHAMPION TRAP SHOOTER

SHOOTING "OM SCRATCH, 25
yards behind the traps, Walter
Beaver pulled out of an excit-
ing tie to win the 34th Grand
American — the ﬁrst time it has
been won by a limit contestant!
He has been a steady smoker
of Camels for years, and “ya:
"I like their taste and mildnen
...thcy never jingle my nerves."

  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

WALTER BEAVER of Berwyn. Pa., wouldn't
be where he is today—holder of the coveted
Grand American Handicap—if it weren’t
for his healthy nerves.

“Winning a trap-shooting championship
is partly a matter of luck, partly the result
of practice and partly healthy nerves," says
the champion. “I'm a steady smoker and have
been for many years. People kid me about
it at the tournaments. They say I never have
a cigarette out of my mouth. During all
these years I’ve been smoking Camels, not
only because I like their taste and their
mildness, but also because they neverjangle
my nerves."

It's no fun to feel that your nerves are
ragged—and to wonder why. Check up on
your eating. . . your sleep... your cigarettes.
(let a fresh slant on smoking. Switch to
Camels. Your nerves and your taste will tell
you that Camels are a more likable cigarette
—and that they don't upset your nerves.
