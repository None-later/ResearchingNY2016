A Logical Thriller . . .

Murder In Bermuda. By Wil.
loughby Sharp. Claude Kendall.
$2.00.

’ The ﬁnding of a body of a beau-
tiful young girl on a main high-
way on the serene island of Her
muda'is the occasion which sets in
motion the adroit, speculative ac-
tivities of the efficient Hamilton
police force. With only a dress-
maker’s label. a bunch of lilies and
an empty scsbbsrd asI‘clues. the
~ 1' ~r skillfully goes on to plot a
nm in which surprise follows
ur sc with engaging regularity
and .vc ﬁnd before us a story which
has a welcome freshness and orig-
inality.

From the outset the story moves
forward at a rapid pace, employ-
ing short, brisk chapters, each one
of which brings a new complex of
situations or new discoveries to
light. The dialogue and charac—
ters are very convincing and the
few dull moments. that do occur
are lost thought of by reason of
the inevitability with which the
new dilemma arises at the end of
every chapter.

Willoughby Sharp makes use of
current notoriety given to the
crimes of kidnaping, rum running.
and blackmailing and weaves it
into his central theme. He creates
numerous difﬁculties and then dis~
penses logically and gracefully
with each in its order, leaving the
reader alternately perturbed and
satisﬁed.

   

 

 

The author utilizes all the long-
accepted conventions of the mys-
tery story. but he does so with
such ingenuity and creates such a
welter of involved circumstances
that we are almost entirely una-
ware of his technical trickery. Af-'
ter allowing us to suspect various
people, the guilt is ﬁnally fastened
on the person who is ostensibly
least concerned with the charac-
ters in the book.

general mystery story is the man-
ner in which the various police ‘of-
ﬁcers working upon the case help
each other and together see the

story. instead of the one stero-
typed super sleuth very nobly can
rying on, we have the small group
solve their problem by their coop-
erative efforts.

Mr. Sharp. who is a Harvard
graduate. and a young retired
member of the New York Stock
Exchange. now a resident of Ber—
muda. has a good bit more to offer

der stories. He unravels his sinis-
ter tale in ﬁne literary style and
writes vividly of a background he
knows very well.

In his school days Mr. Sharp
was a proliﬁc contributor to the
pulp magazines. The leisurely
life in Bermuda appears to have
given him a chance to revert to
his boyhood hobby. He has al-
ready lodgcd the manuscript of
another mystery. The Murder of
the Honest Broker. with his pub-

 

, and the slashed de-
