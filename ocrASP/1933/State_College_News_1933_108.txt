Healthy nerves have carried him successfully

“I know of no sport,” says Erich Hagenlocher.
“that places a greater strain on the nerves than
tournament billiards. ’l‘he slightest inaccuracy

I should say, ‘Watch your nerves!’ ’l‘hat’s why I
smoke Camels. and have smoked them for years.
I like their taste better and they’re milder. liut

popular brand. They give
