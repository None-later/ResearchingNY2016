THE SIDE LINE

 

 

 

At a recent meeting of the men's
athletic council two important appoint-
ments were made. Harry Yal’fee was
named manager of varsity tennis, and
Al Jadick, Beacon's Bad Boy, was
awarded the managership of intra-
mural athletics. Incidentally, Al put
on a peachy intra—mural program last

ear and promises a better slate for
the ‘33-'34 season.

The fracas which you might have
,l witnessed on the Western avenue cam-
lpus last Saturday was what Slueioot
would call socball. The game ended
,in a tic—the frosh scoring one soccer
lgoal and the sophs tallying one foot-
1ball goal. The most thrilling event of
‘thc afternoon was "GS" ancroft’s
successfully attempted deflation act.
Unprecedented, I say, unprecedented.

Monday night, in answer to the ﬁrst
call for varsity and frosh basketball,
about thirty men cluttered up the gym.
According to the expectations of your
columnist (apologies to Winchell), the
' varsity looked a bit rusty and the fresh
should he in the auditorium on Thurs-
,tlay evening to get a few tips from
tAngna linters.

CO-OP HAllli'l‘S

Hallowe’cn always brings to mind
associations with haunted things. The
quest for thrilling adventure is often
satisﬁed by "spooky" parties and dar-
ing journeys through weird places.

These haunts are but passing events
which leave few constructive imprints
upon our minds. However, the stu-
dents ot State college now have the
opportunity to satisfy their desire for
haunting experiences by visitin the
cozy nook called “The Haunted ook-
shop" in a corner of the College co-op-
erativc book store. Marry a. pleasant
hour can be spent there in reading the
best works in literature, and each one
may choose his favorite “literary
haunt" from the well—ﬁlled shelves of
the Co-op’s contribution to our perma-

nent “Literary Hallowe’cn".
