The so delightful author of one so rarely are we given an op-
oi last year's best sellers "1 Feel pomnicy to pry into the private
Better NOW" has flvol'ﬂl her Pilb- lives of our college professors that
lie with another book of refresh- we should consider this charming

ing, lively verse. Miss Fishback.
who lives in New York City, has
gathered an abundance of experi-
ence from ivory day observation
which she incorporates in her
light. rippling lines. She has. a
capacity for tailing the present: in-
cidents occurring in that pulsating
metropolis, and delicately tearing
them apart with gloved hands.
Although her criticism is never ve-
hement, nothing escapes her
shrewdness. Taxicabs and spar-
rows, men and vegetables, all re-
ceive their due from the sharp yet
gentle pen of Miss Fishback. Her
style and type of poetry is similar
' to that of Samuel Hoi‘lenstein's
but where the latter refuses to
make a detour. Miss Fishback
treats euphemistically the many-
sided life that whirs about her.

The author came to R. H. Macy
& Company. New York depart-
ment store, after graduating from
Gaucher College, Baltimore, in
1927.

Her brittle verses and sly ﬁrst
person paragraphs made merchan-
dising for the ﬁrst time gay. per-
meating the business of selling pc»
tato mashers. canaries, and riding
habits with puck-like humor.
Miss Fishbaclr is now a high-
salaried copy writer. a contributor
to current magazines. and the au-
thor of several volumes of verse.

novel of travel brought to us by
Dr. Walter Starkie, professor of
Spanish at the University ofDub-
lin, an invigorating experience.
In Reggie-Toggle. an erudite man
ers doﬁs his pedagogical
1m: l gs and sets out with a ﬁd-
d.. a a camera on an audacious
tramp through the rougher re-
gions of the Balkan countries.
From its beginning this fascinat-
ing tale is one continuous enter-
tainment, expounding adventure
after adventure among the dark-
slrinned, musical vsgaboncls of
Europe’s gypsy clans. It is most
amusing to see our pedant brush-
ing elbows with the more truculent
hall of life. as well as with the
dusky female species whose ad-
vances he passes oil with tactful
gentleness, always taking his ro-
mance with a grain of salt and
never once forgetting his station in
life. We follow this troubadour
and his disguise. waiting for him
to betray himself and his vocation
and we are not at all surprised to
catch him meditating upon the
companions of Xenophon when. he
comes upon the shores of Lake
Balation.

After reading this pleasant book
of travel you will be more prone
to appreciate the latent qualities,
and feel more kindly towards the
sometimes stern, dogmatical ﬁg-
