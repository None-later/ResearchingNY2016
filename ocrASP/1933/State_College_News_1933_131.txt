Lord Dunsany in the narration of
s fanciful tale. In this boolr. os-

. tensiny a romantic tale of Ireland,

the author weaves a sublimely
moving story of a witch-woman,
Mrs. Marlin. who dominates the
scene in which Charles Peridore
acts.

After the sudden escape of his
father. the victim of political in-
trigue. we ﬁnd Charles hunting
upon the wild bogs of the country-
side in the company of the restless
Tom Marlin. son of the witch-
woman. A peat development com-
pany takes an option to exploit
the bog in a fuel manufacturing

endeavor. It is in this particular

situation that the witch-woman
acts in a desperate effort to save
the country from the dispoiling
methods of the new enterprise.
The story concludes with a dra-
matic event of utmost intensity
and the countryside is again free
and immune from the schemes of
men.

Lord Dunsany secures eﬁects of
sheerest beauty by his constant
use of detailed. natural imagery.
His style enables him to achieve
a great clarity even in the difﬁcult
matter of the mysticism and su-
pernatural visions of the witch-
Woman and her doomed son. .The
sheet upon the reader is instanta-
neous and lasting.

The Colonel's Children . .

Worth Remembering. By Rh s
ames. Longmans, Green and o.

.

How far the adult has traveled
on the way of life since childhood
is always poignantly brought
home to us whenever we read so

. excellent a story as that of the

Colonel's children. There are
three of them. all under the care
of the most entertaining Mammy
there ever could be. and it is she
who provides the pathos and zest
in her lovingly abusive handling
of these refractory "chillun". The
locale might be any southern town
and the phrases of the youngsters
are largely composed of the rich.
picturesque language of the Negro.

The rampant, unconventional
nature of these impish terrors is
too much for the Colonel and it is
most amusing to see them making

excellent sport of his elevated,

still lectures on good behavior.
We are regretiul when the host of
adventures ends, at long last. with
the children being sent away to
school.

Rhys James’ use oi the Negro
dialect is superb. His story has
tang and originality. It is a merry
tale in an unusual vein and never
loses the feeling for childhood or
its stormy fun. He returns us to
a land we had long lost and so re-

stores a hearty glow we had not
felt for so very long a time.
