LISTEN To MARY WIGGINS, greatest of all girl
stunt performers, as she tells of her discovery
that one cigarette is different from the others!
She says:

“I have to be slug: my nerves are healthy to
do my stunts, changing from a speeding auto
to a plane. the high dive on ﬁre into ﬁre, wing
walking while up in a plane, and the high-

found that Camels don’t interfere with healthy
nerves. I've tried all the brands. Camels are
milder and better in ﬂavor. They do not give
me edgy nerves even when I am smokinga lot. "

ence there is in Camel's costlier tobaccos.
