is the interesting hobby of Professor
Jesse F. Stinard, head of the Spanish
department.

From boyhood. Professor Stinard
has been interested in making articles
by hand. Since he began teaching. this
creative and artistic sense has found
its outlet in the repairing and restoring
of early Americzui clocks.

He has studied the histories of fam—
ous clocks and their makers; he has
collected models of old types with mod—
ern mechanisms; he has made many of
these live again. In speaking of the
repair work, Professor Stinard says,
“To ﬁle out accurately an escapement
or replace a broken wooden wheel may
require a great deal of patience and time,
but both have their reward. hile
doing this, you may go back in imag-
ination to the time when our country
was still young and think you are do-
ing just what Simon Willard was do—

just what Silas Hoadly, Eli Terry,
Seth Thomas, Riley Whiting, and other
early pioneers in the Connecticut clock
industry were doing over a hundred
years ago."

Not only is Professor Stiuard inter-
ested in their mechanical and historical
aspects, but he feels, moreover, the per-
sonality of clocks—the mystic speech
of their tick-tucks. Mr. Stinard says:

"W hen you have your clock restored
——what a companion it is to youl It is
like a voice from the past trying to
tell you the events it has seen. It sug-
gests the generations that have come
and gone since it began its career, and
the many others it will witness after
you are gone, if some kind and sym-
pathetic friend will give it a little care."

John Lomax and Son Allen Relate
Experiences in “:10 Assembly
Friday Mornan

Once again John Lomax spoke to a
State college audience during the 11 :10
assembly last Friday. r. Lomax. who
was introduced by Dr. Harold W.
Thompson. professor of English, is
widely known in American colleges as
a great scholar and as the man who
started the whole country collecting in-
digenous and beautiful folk literature.

He told of his travels, accompanied
by his son, Allan, through four south-
eru states. searching for the words and
music of negro songs not yet contann
inated by white inﬂuence. He visited
negro prison camps, interviewing over
10,000 blacks, because he believed this
would give him an opportunity to get
directly to the negro himself. Lomax
and his son searched mainly for the
“reals”, the SO-CiillEtl sinful songs of
the colored race.

Allan Lomax, recently a student at
Harvard university. made his ﬁrst ap-
pearance in public when he sang some
of these negro ballads {or the student
assembly. Among them were “Long

ohn", the tale of a fast running negro,

and HHoney, Take a \Vliili on Me". a
cocaine song. At the request of his
father he sang "Black Betty" and
“(treat find Almighty".

As a result of last summer's travels,
over 200 new tunes hav- been ﬁled in
the Library of (‘oiigress They will
constitute the first third of Mr. Lo-
mnx's book. " hillads and Folk Songs
of America". llr. 'l‘hompson will write
the bibliography for this book, which
will be published next January.
