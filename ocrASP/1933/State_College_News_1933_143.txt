Tayety of Viennese life in the.

me of the-Straits waltz masters.
.1 Mr. Ewen begins with a compre-
hensive Iceount of the rise to
fame of the elder Johann Straus.
His , even narration of the
shoddy home life of the musician
convinces us that the man who
was to be the father of the master
.of light music was a hero only in
the midst of the turbulent cafe
life. To his wife, the elder Strauss
was an ungrateful husband with-
out regard for the care of his chil-
dren.

There is a pathetic truthfulness
in the account of the abandoned
wife’s courageous efforts to secure
a musical education for her child,

 

 

Jolwm. Who at an early 1‘.  
an

excellent promise of bee

sure a musician as his worldly
father. He has his triumph in
is“ when he succeeds in awe -
ing Vienna more than had he
father in his debut eighteen years
before. Son is like father in many
respects but he never forgets the
debt he owes to the self-sacrific-
ing mother who is at once the
most human and the moat herioc
person in the biography. Mr.
given presents the contemporary
life of the musician very factually;
he considers the European tours
of both the Strauss' and gives a
full account of the triumph
achieved by the younger Straua

in his American visit to Phila-

delphia.
The biography never penetrates
but ﬂows along at a regular. un-

accented rate over the surface of

Vienesse life like the music of the
carefree fellows it portrays. Here
biography and character go hand
in hand without serious thought
or effect. The book is another
biographyl of a minor ﬁgure in
musical lstory; Mr. Ewen can-
not be ex ected to create a. mu-
ter-piece or he lacks original ma-
terial, the Strauss' were not men
of musical stature, the events in
their lives, with a few momentary
triumphs are not the material
upon which one can successfully
lose a serious biography.
