danger for Eddie Woods, twice all-round cow-
boy champion at the famous Calgary Stampede.
It sure taker healthy nerve: to stay on board a
ﬁghting bronkl "Camel: are my smoke," says
Eddie Woods. "They never jangle my nerves."

 
   
   
   
   
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
   

“WY 0" TIIE um I became
devoted to riding and smoking
Camels. Even if I am not in
the championship class I need
healthy nerves. And Camels do
not upset my nerves. They are
the mildcst cigarette I knowl"

EDDIE Wooos, one of the "top hands" of the
cowboy world, says:

“Ten seconds on the back of an outlaw horse
is about the hardest punishment for a man’s
nerves that anybody can imagine. To have nerves
that can take it, I smoke only Camels. I've tried
them all, but Camels are my smoke! They have
a natural mildness, and I like their _t_s_s_t_e better.
Most important of all, Camels do not jangle my
nerves, even when I light up one Camel after
another.”

IT I_§ MORE FUN TO KNOW
Camels are made from ﬁner,
MORE EXPENSIVE tobacco:
than any other popular brand.

If y_0_u are nervous...jumpy...inclined to “ﬂy
off the handle". . .change to Camels. Your own
nerves and taste will conﬁrm the fact that this
milder cigarette, made from costlier tobaccos. is
better for steady smoking.
