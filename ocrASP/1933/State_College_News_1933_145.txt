 

THE SIDE LINE

"Bungy" lngraham, the Genial
Gentleman from the Southern Tier,
is rapidly recovering from the mis-
tortune he suffered in the ﬁrst hoop
scrimmage of the season. It seems
too bad that "Bungy's" court record
(length) should be thwarted after
such gigantic efforts.

"Sparky" Bancroft is also recov-
ering front a slight dislocationias
usual.

I think the Fresh must have taken
that Angna Enters tip. An improve-
ment seems to have marked their
practice sessions.

I say, A], where is that inlra-mural
program?

Coach Baker's Snowbirds con-

ducted their initial frolic on the
campus on Friday and are looking
forward to another this week.
