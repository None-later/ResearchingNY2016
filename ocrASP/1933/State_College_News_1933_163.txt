M. J. ("MIKE") THOMPSON, FAMOUS

EOOTIALI REFEREE

IF YOU WANT TO SEE nerve strain. look ot"Mllie"
Thompson’s job—refereeing two tons of football
brawn, seeing every detail. but never getting in the
players' way. “Mike” Thompson has been a steady
smoker for years. “ I’m open-minded on cigarettes,”
he says. “but I’ve got to keep my nerves in shape,
so I stick to Camels."

M. J. (“Mike”) Thompson, football‘s most famous
referee, has to keep his nerves healthy. Listen to
what he says:

“Refereeing football never was an armchair
job. and it is more of a strain than ever in this
day of ‘open' play. It takes healthy nerves—
and plenty of wind. too, to cover the ﬁeld...to
stay on top of every fast-moving, deceptive play
during sixty minutes of ﬁghting football. Because
nothing can be allowed to interfere with healthy
nerves I smoke Camels. I have tried them all—

Steacly Smokers turn to Camels

given every popular brand a chance to show
what Lt can oﬂer. Camels don't upset my nerves
even when I smoke constantly. And the longer
I smoke them the more I come to appreciate their
mildness and rich ﬂavor."

Many smokers who have changed to Camels
report that their nerves are no longer irritable
. . . "jumpy." Switch to Camels yourself. Smoke
them steadily. You will ﬁnd that Camels do not
jungle your nerves or tire your taste.
