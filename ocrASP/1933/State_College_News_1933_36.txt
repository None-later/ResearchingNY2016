--'- THE COLLEGIATE WHIRL --'-

 

 

We learn from otie of our contemporaries that disobedient
freshmen at Roanoke college are dealt with in no uncertain manner. The
upperelassmen have organized the freshmen into a Goldfish club. The
requirements for admission state that a prospective member must swallow
tine live eoldilsh.

F‘rom various suui'res we gather the following statistics: Over 2,000 “ads
of gum were removed train the library tables during the spring clean-
at the University of Texas. At Massachusetts Institute of Technology
40.000 keys are needed to open the locks of elassrooins and laboratorie-
where valuable scientifie equipment is kept. Nearly 20,500 apples were
sold at Boston University within ﬁve months.
