STATE COLLEGE NEWS, MAY 25. 1933

OUR PRESIDENT

Dr. A. R. Brubacher, president, has recently suﬁercd
a breakdown, and will be unable to return to oﬁicial duties
until next September. This has been the ﬁrst time in years
that the president of the College has not been present for
the annual Moving-Up Day ceremonies.

Dr. Brubachcr will also be unable to preside at gradua-
tion this June. He has expressed his regret at his inability
to present the diplomas at this time.

The members of the student association sincerely hope
that Dr. Brubacher will rapidly regain his health and be
able to come back with renewed strength.

 

MUST THIS CONTINUE?

Recently a member of the faculty of this College,
while taking a shower in the men's locker room of Draper
hall, was robbed of a small sum of money. It seems that
he had left his clothing in the locker room for but a few
minutes; when he returned, he discovered money, oapcrs,
and the general contents of his pockets gone. This is not
the ﬁrst time that money, or articles of clothing, have
been deliberately stolen from the locker rooms.

Nor do the clever cleptomaniacs conﬁne their activities
to money alone. Miss Fay reports many books missing
from the College Co-opcrzitivc Book Store loan shelves.
Over a hundred have been taken from Hawlcy library.
The articles posted on the lost bulletin board are too mun-
erous to mention. Certainly books, pens, glasses, or pocket—
books did not grow legs and walk away by themselves.
Vhat is the answer? §omeoiic in State collch (prob-
ably more than one) is dishonest enough to take articles
which do not belong to him. 'l‘ruc enough thcs ' are hard
iimes~but the times are harder for the one who has to
stand the loss than the one who is the temporary winner,
It is now toward the bitter part of the year, "he majority
of students here. if cvcr. are now on rnc bottom :is far
are concerned. To lose some valuable ariicle.
means It dcfinilc hole in the budget as well
as a (It-finite loss and privaiiou.

 

 

  

 

GRADUATES 0R( i:\NlZl{

Yesterday marked the ﬁrst social event of the graduate
students oi State college. ’l‘hrougliout the entire year in<
dividual members of this group have seen the tired of for-
mation into some definite organization. Until now nothng
has been done about it.
Last night, in thc gymnasium of llawlcy hall, the
graduate students conducted an informal party. It \as
very well attended, and all of those who attended seems
ineg enjoyed theinselv s. it is to be wondered at that this
group has not before conducted some sort of a social
function,
At Sititc collcgc, it would seem that the graduate stu-
dents are clllircly out of the picture. All of the classes
here have class meetings, parties, ilanc dinners. Nearly
every department has its club and its social functions. Be-
cause so many of the graduate students are conﬁning their
studies to education and graduate courses, very few, if
any, are given thi- rniportunity to join in any social or-
ganization of the College.
(irailiiziti: students are not required to attend asscmblies;
very few of them ever scc the Nizws or any other Collcgc
publication. ()n the whole, they are like grownup orphans.
entirely divorced from College and the siiicullcd college
spirit,

This occasion indicates that on the part of the graduate
students of this (college, the spirit is thcrc, at least.

it is to be hopt‘d that in future years, other graduate
students will avail themselves of iin- opportunities open to
them in this held. May they continui- in thc same line, and
iuzikc something dclinilv and prrunincnt of this first rc-
Izirilcil attempt at organization,
