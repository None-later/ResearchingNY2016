BASEBALL VARSITY
TO PLAY HARTWIGK

State Defeats St. Stephens, 12-3;
Last Game To Be Tomorrow
At 3:00 At thgeﬂeld.

The varsity baseball team will play
its last game of the 1933 season to-
morrow afternoon at 3:00 o’clock on
the Ridgcﬁeltl Park diamond, contest-
ing the team from Hartwick college at
Oneo'uta. Coach Rutherford Baker will
start the regular line-up, with "Ossy"
Brooks on the mound. This game will
mark the last appearance of three vet-
erans, Johnnie Detlefson, Gil De-
Laura, and “Hack” Young, as they will
he graduated in June. Detlefson and
DeLaura have been members of the
baseball squad for four years, and
Young has played for three years.

The State nine defeated St. Stephen’s
college at Aunandalc last Saturday by
a score of 12 to 3. Due to the stellar
pitching of “Ossy” Brooks, who struck
out fourteen men in a row, and the
hitting of “Hack” Young, the game
resulted in victory [or the Purple and
Gold. Two previous games on the
baseball schedule were cancelled be-
cause of rain.
