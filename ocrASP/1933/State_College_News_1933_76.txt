I " Sentimentallty . -
' In. Barr” [By Frederick Niven. .E. P.
' putters I co. $2.50

Kindlirma and fortitude are so all-
dom to be eaperienead in this world to-

' day. that to have them vividly brought

to us in the pawn of Mrs. Barry is an
unforgettable pleasure. Ir. Niven ltIa
written a touching. well modulated mas-
ter-pieca in depicting the homely vicis-
situdea oi a Woman of simple nieana and
charitable‘dlI' ition. She lacks edu-
posscaaea a fund of
knowledge oi the things which are se-.
cured Ipontariaoully through the-heart,
rather' than through the more proalsc
mlndi v ‘

‘ With Ire. Barry, we ﬁnd her young
Ion, Neil. a fellow who would bring vea-
atlon, heartache and happiness to the
mother who wished to do so much (or
him with so very little at her command.
He is superbly set down. His inquiIl-
tivcness and untactiulneas are truly boy-
like and unheeding oi the deep hurt
they bring to his mother. She accepts
his adolescent questioning and carries
it of? gracefully and shrewdly until the
danger is passed.

Mr. Niven docs remarkably well in
keeping the story above sentimentality.
His style depends considerably on the
ﬁneness of his use of dialogue and his
characters speak only for themselves.
He builds a story somewhat reminiscent
of the work of Katherine Mansﬁeld.
However, his quality goes deeper than
hers——he has. as' she had. a gift for ca-
tracting the essentials of a little episode
so that every word secures 3 worth and
richness of sheet seldom obtained in
literature. The loving kindness of Mrs.

His philosophy of life is eapreIIed in

for us in his rcportorial style. He pre-

GEORGIA'S NEWLY CREATED COLLEGE

Four-hundred modern misses have taken possession of Winnie Davis Memorial Hall on the campus or the Univer- r
sity of Georgia for the ﬁrst trial of the newly created Coordinate College of that institution. This college com-
bines the advantages of the large universities and those of the smaller college. and gives to the small college, alter
which the new college was modeled, the many services that a university renders.
