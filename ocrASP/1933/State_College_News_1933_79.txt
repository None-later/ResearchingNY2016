what makes
a cigarette
taste better

HAT makes anything taste
better? It’s what is in it
that makes a thing taste better.
CHESTERFIELDS taste better be-
cause we buy ripe tobaccos. These
ripe tobaccos are aged two and a
half years—thirty months. During
this time the tobaccos improve—
just like wine improves by ageing.
CI—llz‘S’l'EltFllElDS taste better be-
cause they have the right kind of
home-grown tobaccos and Turkish
Tobaccos “welded together.”
We hope this answers your
question.
