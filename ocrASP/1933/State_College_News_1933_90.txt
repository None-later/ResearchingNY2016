EDWARD COOPER
WRITES ARTICLE
0N BOOKKEEPING

“Comparative Merits of Single and
Double Periods in Bookkeeping" is the
subject for an article published in the
September number of the Balance Sheet
and written by Edward C. Cooper. in-
structor of commerce. The article is
an excerpt from his master's thesis for
which he received his degree at the Uni-
versity of Ohio in 1931

In the middle west, as in some places
farther east, double periods of book-
keeping are used in secondary schools.
The article proves that there is no
justification for usini,r these, and that
single periods are just as effective. To
quote from his writing: “The examin—
ation results indicate that the factor of
single period or double period is not
an important factor. Since the double
period plan of instruction requires
twice as much teachng time and twice
as much teaching equipment, the use
of the double period is not justiﬁed.”
The statistics for the study were taken
from the “Commercial Educational
Survey" made by the Whitewater State
'l‘eachers' college in 19 .
