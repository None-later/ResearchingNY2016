ANOTHER EPIDEMIC

State college is again raging with an epidemic, the
cause of which is unknown to science. It is suspected that
the infection is the direct result of the bite Of some un-
known and terrible bug. Some diagnose individual cases
as being a bite from the bug of self-conceit; others call
the insect carelessness or thoughtlessncss.

Every effort should be made to stamp out the epidemic
before it spreads to the younger members of the group.
More than that, every precaution should be taken to avoid

infecth people.

The disease is rather obvious because the person acts
mentally deranged at times. These people are laboring
under the delusion that because their education is handed
to them from the State on a "silver platter", another kind
genii will hand out a job in June. There is an old saying.
you know, “All good things come to him who waits"—
but not to him who waits until blanks for the appointment
bureau are long past duel

THREE BY FIVE

Every year Campus Commission has a tussle over the
cleanliness of the College buildings. By the looks of the
floor of the lower corridor on Draper hall, in thc imme-
diate vicinity of the mail box, one would think this build-
ing inhabited by a family of frisky mice. No, the notes
strewn about the floor aren't quite torn into shreds.

The Campus Commission has heretofore made a ruling
that all epistlcs placed in the mail box are to equal or
exceed the live by three inch Size. One glance at the letter
box would show that we are all either too poor to aflnrd
a piece of paper that sizc or that we don't give a hang
whether our friends get our holes or not. Perhaps if we
wrote II little more and not quite so often we could manage
in eke out from our precious slnrc of paper a slip large
enough to satisfy the Campus Commission.

How different i. ()'.\3I.'i||'s latest play, Ah, Wilder-
ness! from some. of his previous successes. Perhaps
the first an" ‘Ig contrast which would attract the
reader's notice is the absence of morbidness—bnth in
plot and character. in fact, the characters seem quite
normal.

The story t'cutcrs around the home life of a well-to-
llU editor of a smallvtown newspaper. The main char-
acters of the play are Nat Miller's immediate family:
the leading role is taken by his seventccn»_\'car~olrl son,
Richard. The lllclllC and setting which surround the
boy are curioust like 'l‘orkington's Seventeen.

Richard falls in love—but with a child much younger
than himself. in his eagerness to relay to her some
n his advanced literary experiences, he sends her
excerpts from Swinburne, Oscar \Vilde, and Omar
l\'hayyaiu. Of course her father, one of those sI

despair, ll lard resorts to wine. \VUIIICII, and song.
As a result, he gets most awfully sick. Fortunately.
he is allowed to rcncw his friendship with the girl
and comes out none the worsc for the experience and
perhaps a bit wiser.

Reviewers sccm to be puzzled as to whether the
writer has meant the play to he a comedy or a satire.
When the book is read, however, it seems to be a
delightful combination oi the two. The greatest con-
trast is. |H'I'lI;t|)>, their l‘t‘hlll'k’llYL‘ reading lnstcs.

“Men and Women of 1933—Kuuu Your Own Era!"
ls Keynote of Annual State Student Couleieuce

lly ALMIIIA Russ, '34
Senior Associale editor

“Men and women of l933—kuow
your own era!" These words sounded
the keynote of the annual State Student
conference at Cornell university during
the weekend as two hundred delegates
representing various New York State
colleges met to consider socio-economic
and religious problems in relation to
the modcrn individual. Alniira W.
Russ, '34, chairman of the State col-
lege representatives, presided over the
conference as general chairman.

lntcr-dcpciulcncc of the three main
phases of the world's problem was
stressed by each of the speakers prc<
sentng the subject to the assembled
men and women. The divisions were:
need or a personal God for each in-
dividual for a greater faith, reorganiza-
tion of the bases upon which Christian
missionary work is being promoted in
foreign lands, and the ﬁnding of a cure
for the existing sociovecnnnmic ills.

Atheism, the NRA, Nazism, paciﬁ-
cism. and sL‘li-Cxprcssinn were some of
the main topics presented the delegates
for discussion. Leading speakch of-
fered conuncnt on the three-fold phase
of problems confronting the confer-
ence, after which the members split
into smnll groups for thc purpose
of round—table discu " or their
objccfiolis and s ons were answered
in a general met-ting.

llr. William l’auck, of the lfnivcrv
sity of Ilcrlin, addressed the first meet—
ing Friday night on the snbjcct “l’cr-
soual l'owcr for Crcntivc Living." He
explained the German youth movement,
with its rvnction against the scion,
family, and church, and emphasis upon
simplicity in conventions and love of
nature. .\|odcrn civi :Ition, the Ger»
man student feels, is killing the mod-
crn youth's initiative, because it has
done so much to awe ynuni,r people with
the responsibilities of life. Dr. Pauck
traced llIc influence of this movement
upon Herman literature as well, and
cudcd his address with a powerful ap-
pcul for a personal (ind, all-encompass-
