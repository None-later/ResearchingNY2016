State Vanquishes
Middlebury Five
With 58-53 Score

:\ savage display of ot‘fensivo strength
carried a ragged but very powerful State
quintet to an inspired victory over a
strong Middlebtiry Five. ’Jlie score
(58-53). indicates clearly the pattern of
the game. 130th squads concentrated .on
getting baskets and let illc‘t'lclL‘llSlVL'
angle of the game take care oi itself.

It was not good basketball. perl'
(the mad total oi 111 points lrey .
glaring defensive errors on both sides)”-
but it was a magnificent spectacle. No
one who witnessed this wild orgy of

hysterical, vicious combat will ever for:

get how a furiously scrappy squad ot

State men demanded—mid 'Lt wed-—

victory from a team which we still
believe is their physical superior.

Bob Murray's cool sharpdiooting pre:
cisian (26 liuttest—to-goodness points in
it). ,lerry Ainyot's deftly c L” ‘d. un—
wearilv accurate passes. the ltard lighting
lloorwbrk of George llaiieroit. and the
inspired drive of the entire team, all fur-
nished a spine-tingling thrill for all the
State spectators. 'l‘lterc may have bccn

better teams on that Page hall gym ii
