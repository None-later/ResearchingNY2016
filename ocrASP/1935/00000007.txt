EDWIN BOYD, '35- Engineering Student:
"An engineering ﬁeld trip is enough to
tire out anybody. When I'm lugging a
transit and tripod across rough country...
taking the hills as they come...ﬁghting
through brush and woods...l’ll admit I
often get tired clear through. No wonder
you'll ﬁnd me smoking a Camel most of
the time. For I've learned that a Camel
restores my energy—cheers me up—
makes the miles ahead seem easier. And
why not enjoy a Camel whenever I want
one—Camels never get on my nerves!"
