Bureau " 3,
Russell Cheadle

'. Phi Kappa Tau
Ohio Universin

“I'd like a girl about ﬁve foot ﬁve.
She must be a good dancer, is good
conversationalist. and make a nice
appearance.”

The attendant of the Dating Bureau
'took a card from his ﬁle, and handed
it to Pete. He copied the girl’s name.
address. and telephone number.

"How much?” he asked.
"Ten cents."

Pete laid the dime on the counter,
and went in search of a student direc-

tory.

The Dating Bureau was a new idea
to Petr-in fact. it was a new idea to
the college. The college had started
the bureau with the idea of giving the
bashful maidens in the dormitories a
chance at collegiate night-life. but
there were exceptions. and by the
description on the card, Pete thought
that he had picked an exception.
Anyway. he needed a date for the Tri-
Phi formal in a hurry.

Came the night of the formal. and
Pete went to pick up his date at the
Dorm. He waited in the lounge. and
watched the girls passing the door,
wondering which one was his date. He
noticed a girl sitting on a davenport
opposite him dressed in an almost
absurd pink formal. Pete shuddered—
the girl was coming toward him.

“Are you Peter Hamlin?" Her voice
was a decided soprano.

Pete managed to gulp out the an-
swer.

“I've been ready. oh. ever so long.
Shall we go?”

After the ﬁrst shock had died. Pete
decided that she might not be so bad.
Perhaps she was a good dancer. They
started for the hotel.

"You know.“ she cooed. “I just
adore dancing. My roommate and
I are always dancing. We have in-
vented the cutest little step. 1'"
show it to you when we get to the
hotel."

ayes-u

"Did you notice my dress? It's an
exact copy of the dress my grandmother
were when she was married. Isn't it
funny how it is now back in style?"

"Uh. huh.”

They reached the hotel and began
to dance. Pete felt himself being
pulled around the ﬂoor using steps
that he never knew existed.

"Let's go over in a comer and I’ll
show you that new step.“

.Pcte lived through what seemed
years of agony while the girl demon-
strated a step that wouldn't ﬁt any
music written. Throughout the even-
ing he wondered where the mistake
could have occurred. for this could
not be the girl who had been described
to him at the Bureau. He wondered
who could have given such an inviting
description to such a' girl.

 

“Isn't the dating bureau a wonderful
idea. Just think. if it wasn't for it.
1 would never have met you.”
