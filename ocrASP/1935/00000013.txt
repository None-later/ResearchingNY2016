ABOLISH CLASS OFFICES???

In tlle edition oi the STATE COLLEGE NEWS for November 16, 1934, tbc need
for continuing the present system of class organizations was questioned. It was
suggested that the small number in each class (who become actual membc“ (
the class by paying dues) was indicative of a lack of interest in such org' ri-
tions. It was pointed out that actual dciiiocrary \v'is outed, that the minority
ruled. At the same time. it was stated that we 'dcd this situation as iii-
tolerable but legal. We have no quarrel with mini) tics nor do we direct this
attack against any person. Our motive was and is based strictly on pl'iliciplc.

In reply to our various statements. we have the following coininuiiicalioii from
a representative of the student body (whose idicntty we do not disclose simply
because of editorial policy):

Recently there appeared in the NEWS an editorial con-
tending that class organizations should be abolished. In sup- 1
port of this contention it was argued that a small minority,
those who have paid their dues, can easily and legally run
the activities of a class. This is admittedly true, but whether
or not it is an argument for the abolition of class organiza—
tions, is a question.

There are in this college many persons with spirit enough
to accomplish things. They work hard, fulﬁll their obliga-
tions, and in many cases ﬁnd an outlet for their energy in
class activities. These persons should not he cheated of this
ﬁeld of activity because of the LACK i 81’ R AND
RESPONSIBILITY of others. That is. unfortunately. a
very simple and deﬁnite description of the feeling so preva-
lent in this college. The failure of class organizations here
to compete with those of other colleges can be ascribed to
this feeling. There is no one in State college who cannot
aiford to pay his class dues and take an active part in cl
activities. If. within a short period of time, it were a -
of choosing between the payment of class dues and departure
from college, no one would leave.

Let us not, therefore, argue for the abolition of class or-
ganizations, but rather let us argue for a more deﬁnite (llhpllly
of class spirit. Surely no one wishes to remember himself
merely as a State college graduate. He wants to say, ” Class
of i Buy, What a clasﬁl”

\\'i: wish to i'olliiiii-iiil lill' lilii' spirit \beirli pl'oiiiptid tlu- ui‘iti‘l'. It is utiih ii

followed in order to effect a more democratic system?
