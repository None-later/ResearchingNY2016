GRECIAN GAMBOLS

 

 

 

Requiescat in pacel

And truer word was never spoken.
Now that the last vestiges of the strug-
gle have been laid decently to rest, the
sorors who have left our noble halls feel
that it is possible to return without
fear of hair-pulling and nail-biting.

So they come back to confabs and cat-
parties. Gamma Kap thus welcomed Mar-
jorie Langmuir, and Eleanor Gage, both
of the class of '32; Dorothy Grifﬁn and
I-Iilda Proper, last' year's grads, camped
out at Psi Gain. and Maybelle Matthews,
’34, found respite from the weary
world at Chi Sig. Virginia Hawkins,
’32, spent the week-end recuperating at
Phi Delta sorority. Gamma Phi Sigma
held what amounted to a reunion at
490% Western avenue, with a total
of nine almus present. They were:
Mary Iiott, '29, Gertrude Western. Elea-
nor Calahan, and Mary Margcnstaru,
all of the class of ’3], Marion Appleton.
Mercedes Martin and Eleanor Kelley,
all ’32’s, and Hilda Bradley and Louise
Kelly, ’34.

COMMUNICATIONS

Editor State College News:

What's up? Don‘t our class presi-
dents know how to hold a knife? Or
have they a fear of introducing speakers?
Or are we all anticipating indigestion?
Or is there really a plausible excuse for
our lament that class banquets this year
just aren't? We remember banquets in
the past. Maybe they were pretty had.
We urgently desire steaks that you can
see and eat. We with others advocate
bigger and lx‘tter—especially better
speakers. Ilut despite these faults, we
had a good time. We made friends and
got ideas—«a few but some.

If banquets were improved along the
lines we suggest, 'certainly a great deal
of Worth could be derived from them.
liven if it were merely a change from
staying home to grind away hoping for
an A in education, a banquet would
break the monotony of a college lie that
has always been too far removed from
social life.

(Some on, class presidents, let's go
places and have bauquetsl We'll come
and support you—if you be a s(up)port
too and give us food and talk that is
worth at least half the cost of attending.
I'Iow’s about it, leaders?

“With Every Cut imaiéigiu
Be Theme Song, Figures Disclose

“I think of 21 cents with every cut

take," ought to be State college stu-
dents' theme song because the cost per
clock hour for the average student is
roughly 21 cents. Furthermore, do you
realize that the State of New York ex-
pends approximately $23.40 for you to
register for and take a three—hour
course?

'I’hesc figures are estimates, but they
are based on the fact that it costs the
State of New York approximately $265
per year to educate each duly matricu—
lated student upon examination of budget
ﬁgures. Formerly the cost of instruct-
ing each student for one year was as
high as $300. Under the present con—
ditions a four year education brings the
State's expenditures to well over $1000.

ANNOUNCE SCHEDULE

The inter-group house basketball games
will take place every Saturday morning at
10:00 o'clock begiiuiing March 2. There
are eight houses participating in the
schedule. They are Syddum hall, Alden
hall. Page hall, Newman hall, Wren
hall, Waterbury hall, Emerson hall, and
“Y” House. Annie 1\Icl-lugh, '18, is
in charge of the games.

TO HAVE ART EXHIBIT

Au exhibit of modern photography
will be on display in the art department
until Monday, according to Dorothea
Gahagau, president of Dramatics and
Arts association. The American Fed—
eraliou of Art in conjunction with Dra—

As another reminder that the depres-
sion days are bygones, information has
been disclosed that the 1935-36 budget
for State college is $379,470. as com-
pared to this year’s figure of $362,476.
"his, however, does not represent a
direct increase of about $07,000, but
means that salary cuts will be restored.

 

Fraternity Should Create
Closer Personal Relations

The promotion of closer and fuller
personal friendships and a more well—
developed social life should be the
object of every fraternity. These
were the basic ideas developed by Dr.
A. It. Brubacher in his address Sun—
day at the formal banquet of Gamma
chapter of Kappa Delta Rho, at the
Madison Manor I‘IOUSL'.

Dr. Ilrnbacher explained the social
systems used at the English colleges
at Oxford and Cambridge, and their
gradual duplication at Harvard and
Yale. The social life of these col—
leges is incorporated into numerous
“sub—colleges" where close contact
between fellow students is brought
about through dining halls and
lounges. Here everyone is on an
equal basis and shares equal privi-
leges and restrictions.

The fraternity should promote
loyalty to its alma mater lirst. and to
the fraternity secondly, also stated
Dr. Brubachcr. In serving this two-
fold purpose, the social problem it-
self, of the college, would be settled.
In this task, the fraternity house is
all-important in that it becomes the
foundation of the fraternity in pro-
viding the centralizing influence for
the intimate relationships which are
found in the larger universities.
