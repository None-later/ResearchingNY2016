The Queens for a Day had de-
scended from their thmnes into the
slime oi slavery. No longer would
their new. fall frocks adorn their
own anatomies. They had been
signed their places in the attic. The
meals had degenerated to the ac—
customed soup and salad. Condi-
tions were almost normal again.

To the novice it would seem that
all was over. But not There was a
tradition to be upheld; namely. to
get the new sisters of! to a flying
start. Consequently, the fraternity
phones rang long. loud and per-
slslently.

with this object in vlcw, the
tribe of Theta Theta went into a
huddle of ways and means to snare
the wily males into blind dates.
They concentrated on Tau Mu.
their slogan being: “The best, if you
can get it."

The mighty Tau Mus impressed
on their newly acquired serfs the
importance of rallying around, thus
aiding and abetting the Theta The-
tas in their diabolical schemes.

"Now look here; you freshmen
can't afford to let those girls down.
They phone over here in.a lady-
ilke way to get dates for their
pledges. You ought to feel honored.
for the Theta Thetas are the but

He was in a gush-awful mess.
but what was he to do? He had
already learned that Sam Brown
was mightier than any promise.
At least Louise wouldn't date any—
body. Bhe was a Theta Theta
pledge but by a little subtle sleuth—
ing he had found out that she was
sick, thank goodness.

At eight ﬂat Bill was in the The-
ta Theta house. Must be saving an
overhead, he thought, as he barked
n shin on an ovcr-stutfcd chair
built for two. Then a terrible
thought. He didn't know the dame's
