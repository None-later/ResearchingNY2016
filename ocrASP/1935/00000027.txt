Annabella Wntuns wu gain:

a beau elusive young lady.
charming most sought after

mats. v

But while her thoughts were so
fondly roaming. ' her father -had
other ideas. Eighteen years before
he had been bitterly disappointed
at the birth of a baby girl and had
sworn she would be as athletic a
sort of individual as his son would

va been.

All her life Annabelle had been
forced to kick footballs with her
tiny feet. thrust her lovely hands
at heavy punching bags. and enter—
tain herself by construcing diner-
ent obiccts with her expensive tool
chest. And now her father insisted
that she learn to swim. U

Seven years before was the time
that she had ever summoned up
enough courage to utter the water.
and at-thls time she was instantly
ducked by one of her wellmeaning
friends. It had taken poor Anna-
belle quite a while to recover from
this terrifying experience. Pbr years
the use of the word "swimming"
had been prohibited in the Wat-
kins' household. But as time

passed, Mr. Watkins overcome

these silly notions and resolved

that his daughter should team to

swim. since he had been such an

excellent swimmer in his day.

When Annabella heard of these

plans. she was horriﬁed. she said

that she was never. never going to
learn to swim. Mr._Watklns. in-
censed at his daughter's stubborn
refusal. called her a coward. a dis-
grace to humanity. and many
names which are not often repeat-
ed in polite society.

The next. day. after much tug-
slnz. tannins. screunins. cryina.
and yelling. Annabelle was finally
ushe into the car. and armed
down to the swimming pool. Aft“
being nona-too—gently placed in ha:-
suit by her usually timorousnmthur
. . . for orders were orders. . .‘abo
was escorted to the water‘s edge.

d

 

pool and her avoirdupois so that
she might skim over the water
in an eel-like way. No. she would
not do it! Mr. Watkins want walk-
ing toward her. first trying to coax
her lovingly. then laying aside all
pretense of adoration and devotion,
he began reaching for her rebelli-
ous feet so as to make them kick.
even if he had to do it himself.

Armabcllc was getting madder by
this time. since she had all the tart
ra ﬁrms spectators inwrestodly
watching the performance. Being
no publicity hound. Annabelle be-
gun to wish vehemently that the
audience would center their attain-
tions elsewhere. Finally. for the
sake of the family name. she start-
cd slowly raising her previously Im-
mobilc feet to a height that was
somewhat nearer the surface of the
water. Her mother's beseechlng ex-
pression became triumphant; her
father loosened his death-like grip
on her bonumbed legs, and the un-
bidden spectators relaxed to a more
normal condition. In spite of all
resolutions. Miss Watkins had
teamed to swim.

With happy expressions on their
beaming faces. the proud parents
talked a blue streak all the way
home. But Annabella remained at-
lent. when thay arrived at their‘
imposing domicile. she lumped
quickly from the car and rushed
into the house, running straight to
hor room. '

Modest and timid? Oh. not

she was heartbroken that no
gallant young gnntleman would
ever be able to rescue her from the
terrifying depths at in swimming
pool . . . for now sho' could save
herself!
