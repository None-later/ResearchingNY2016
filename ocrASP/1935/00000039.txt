Editor, The Miner

“Mr. President. ' '
"Members of the Faculty. You
have heard my petition that I .be
permitted to make a plea before
you in answer to
have hear lodged ag
have reunited in my expulsion from
State Tech." v

The speaker was Bill Davis.
student and editor of The Tech
Times, now expelled because of
alleged derogatory remarks pub-
lished in the Times and directed at
the person of one “Boss” Henderson,
politician extraordinary and pub-
licity hound unexcelled. The
scene was a special meeting of the
Faculty of State Tech. called at the

least half the student body.
"Gentlemen." Bill continued.
"since my entrance is the ﬁrst
grade of elementary school I have
heard praised the virtues of honesty.
"Through high school and on into
State Teeh,-I have gone under the
impression that the practice of
these virtues would surely lead me
to a high place.

“Two years ago. however. I was
fortmate to be in a position to
learn some things which, to me,
Were surprising indeed. As time
went on. these facts, and they are,
began to collect and co-ordinate
themselves. Now, I believe I hold
the skeleton of an interesting story.
I have me unwarrantedly famil-
iar with a situation which could not
exist, in the minds of the unsus-
pecting public. 1 need say no more
than that I believe I hold the wel-
fare of State Tech in this package."
Bill carelessly hefted a large
maniiia envelope. ‘
"Gentlemen." the speaker added.
“I remark from the Bible that 'he
among you who is without sin, let
him cast the ﬁrst stone'."

The President-chairman was Vis-
ibly annoyed, for it was he who was
responsible. through the command
of "Boas" Henderson. for the ex-
pulsion of Bill and four of his
Times assistants. ,

The President stood up.
"Members of the Faculty, are
there any questions?"

A young professor stood and was

 

"May I ask Mr. Davis," he began.
what the nature of the matter is
that he claims to have there."
"Yea. Professor Moore. I have
here some evidence which would
lead to the investigation and pos-
sible eapou‘: of unethical and
criminal activity on the part of
individuals connected with State
Tech. However. since these things
are only alleged, I would prefer
that they be placed in the hands of
the courts for action according to
the merit of the evidence."
"Thank you." Professor Moore

u

"If there are no more questions.
gentlemen, may I speak in my
capacity as President of State
Tech." The chairman now had the
ﬂoor. “You understand that if
you take action against the policy
of the administration you lay
yourselves open to treatment simi-
lar to that received by Mr. Davis."
“The chair will now receive any
that may be made.”
"Mr. Chairman,’ Professor Moore
was again asking for recognition.
"I move that the Faculty of
State Tech demand the reinstate-
ment of Mr. Davis and his asso.
ciates, and that he be given a
public apology for the treatment
imposed upon him.”
A clamor of voices seconded the
motion before the annoyed chair-
man could grasp the meaning of the
words.
"Those in favor of the motion as
stated, signify by rising," the
wehairman mumbled.

Moore. the group began to rise.
The suited secretary began to
count again. and then
