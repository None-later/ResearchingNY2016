S'I‘A'I‘li COLLEGE NEW , MARCH 8. 19.35

 

100 Men Sought
For Class of ’39

Larger Number of Male Students
Will Not Lower Scholastic
Average Greatly

The number of men entering
lcge in the c s' 11 ct .‘
in order to . ihlish a more nearly equal
proportion among tllc men and women
students of the college. according to an
announcement issued by Dr. A. R. l'o'u-
tat-her, president.

l'ointiug out that the scholastic aver-
age Iroin the men entrants would not
be much lower than the entr’ ice stainl-
ards alreme maintained. llr. Ilrubaclit-r
stated that this policy would be attempted
in selecting the incoming freshman el .

"\\’e are making an elTort to incre’
the number of men to llltl," Dr. llru-
haclier stated. “We hope thereby to
draw students froiii the village atitl rural
are. 5 of the state. t year, if we had
admitted as many as IOU men. the scho-
la tic average of the Inwest entrant would
have been around 82 percent instead of
the 85 percent standard."

Stat ties gathered from the tiles of
the Ntws show that the number of men
students has been steadily increasing. In
1031 there were 30 men in the freshman

Since that time the number has
increased until, in 1932. there were (i-I
ireshmen iiicu enrollcdi In the coming
year. if the proposed plan woi ts satis-
iat‘tol‘lly. an all-time hiin of ltlll malt-
freshmen will he reached.

State college will undoubtedly 'ive
a great deal of bent-tit from this increased
male elirolliiieiit. Sports will take on an
added I igc iccaiise ol the wealth of
material available. The prospective itnil'
