—for that better taste
ana’fmgrant aroma

Turkish tobacco leafis so tiny
that each of these bales contains
from 70 to 80 thousand leaves.

But there's another and
greater diEerence—Turkish is
the most spicy and aromatic to-
bacco in the world.

We have Chesterﬁeld buyers
in all the tobacco markets of
Turkey and Greece, including
Xanthi, Cavalla, Smyrna arid
Samsoun.

And when you blend and
cross-blend aromatic Turkish
tobacco with mild ripe home-
grown tobaccos as we do in
Chesterﬁeld

—you have _a milder cigarette,
a better-tasting cigarette.
