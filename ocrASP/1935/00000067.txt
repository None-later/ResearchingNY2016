"Come On,
H II
Y BY
John Bradbury

University of Georgia
Athens, Georgia ,

 

 

It all began innocently enough
with two well-meaning. education-
seeking boys attending the same
prep school.

Pete McEver and ﬂy Nollens ar-
rived at Gainesviile on the some
train and neither knew the other
from the Hawkinsviiie courthouse.
No, neither knew that beiore they
left school on the some truth two
years later they would be ac:
claimed as nil-state forwards for
1032.

Nor did they know that they
would happily share each othcr‘s
joys and sorrows as roommates for
two years. No. neither knew that
on the hardwood court they would
work as a unit. as one, and that
they would play the game for the
love of it and not for the news-
pupcr publicity and prnlsc that
they got. Neither cared about this
kind at praise.

The most. praise either could get
was the other‘s rnuing about it
mistake he had made in the last
game. “Come on. Hy" become n
familiar expression during those
two years because this was Pete‘s
way of telling Hy that he had
eluded his guard and was headed
tor the biLSkBL. Never once did Hy
fall to respond to this call.

No. neither knew that. ﬁll this
would happen . . . but it did.
Neither hardly realized it at gradu-
ation two years later, and surciv
neither realized Just how l‘
their friendship meant when the.V
were accepting scholarships to two
different schools—Pete to (margin
and Hy to Gcorgin Tech.

Pete was starring for Georgia
his ﬁrst year on the varsity und
Hy, as he always did. played his,
regular steady game during the
season. Pete was ﬂashy and Hy
stendy. This probably describes the
play of these two basketball play-
crs better than any other two
words.

Then cumr: the game. The game
between Georgia nnd Tech -— and
with it come the usual keen rivalry
which is present in it” Georgia-
'I‘eeh sports; The grime was close, ‘
in iaet, with only two minutes; lcit,
the score was tied. Harrold, Hull-
dog guard. took a long shot and
missed. Hy took the but] from the
lziickbonrti and dribblcd out——

“Come on. Hy.

It was Pete milling the old lu-
milinr expression that had won
them lame.

Hy hesitated and looked ni Fete.
who writs "brenking" lor the basket.
Suddenly he forgot. the grime, the
intense rivalry, und his desire ioi'
victory. He only thought of the
two happy yours he and Pete lliltl
npent in prep school tllld the news-
papers the next morning acclaim-
lng Pelt' ns All-Anwrlcnn. lie and» ..
richly realized how much their
friendship hud meant to him.

He priest-(i under the basket!
