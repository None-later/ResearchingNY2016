.-\.\' EXPERIMENT

" biiicc collegi- deans so often face the unpleasant task of sending sin-called
billets duux.’ to students. it is a pleasure to both parties when occasion ariscs
to send a missile bearing glad tidings. On Tuesday, arch l2, Dealt Nelson
issued letters to 170 Statc college students. 'I‘hcsc were not the usual “billets
doux,” but letters of cmigratulzition. 'I‘lic ' ' their

At this point, ita are l1l|l yct sutlicicm to predict thc conclusions. ‘

The group which rcccivcd this privilcgc has bccn carcfully sclcclcil. I’rom tht

to file excuses. .-\bsi: ‘- mm as. mlin ihiriiii,r the past neslt iccount for

To date. it has been deemed wise to check on sci rid of thi’ ' Irct group in
order to inquire whether or not Ihc iiicreasc in iuiinbi-r of :ibscnccs over those
of last sctnestcr is due to :i inisconsiruiiig of ibc incaiiing carried by thi- Ictter.

them. However. siucc iltc L'ollcgc does havc standards to maintain. should
