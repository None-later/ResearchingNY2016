Cigarettes

—jzm‘ plum common-sense

iii/hen you stop to think about your
cigarette—what it; means to you—
here’s about the way you look at it—

Smoking a

cigarette gives a lot of

pleasure—it always has.

People have been smoking and
enjoying tobacco in some form or
another for 400 years.

Of course you want a cigarette to
be made right. And naturally you
want it to be mild. Yet you want it to
have the right taste—and plenty of it.

In other words—you want it to

Satisfy.
