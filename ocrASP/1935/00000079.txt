Rivalry Trophy Disappears
During Potter Club Dance

It appears, according to campus
rumor. that the inter-rivalry cup has
not yet decided with whom it wishes
to permanently reside. the reason be-
ing that it disappeared from the Pot-
ter club dance Saturday night. at
which function it was the guest of
honor.

It seems that the silver ctip was
conspicuously displayed by the ex-
uberant freshmen, much to the dis—
may of their rival class. Accord-
ingly. dtiring the course of the even-
ing. the lights were mysteriously
doused. in the middle of a dance num-
ber. and when they came up again
after no little procrastination. the cup
and three sophomores were A.\V.O.L.

The trophy is at the present time
in the custody of the freshman class.
having been returned before the dance
was over.

Assembly Program
To Feature Budget

Finance Board Estimate Calls for
Total of $13,113.87 With
Ten Dollar Tax

The Student Board of Finance will
present a budget to the Student associa-
tion in the 11:10 assembly today calling
for $l3.ll3.87 to pay for next' year‘s
student activities. Although the new
budget is almost a thousand dollars in
increase over last year's. the ﬁnance
board will again ask the association to
pass a ten dollar tax, according to Glenn
Ungercr. '36. member of the board and
member of Myskania. senior honorary
society. for 1935-36. who will present
the budget.

Myskaiiia will announce this morning
the results of the preference ballot con-
ducted oti budget items a few weeks ago.
If not enough items are eliminated by
the ballot to bring the budget down to
$12.000.0tl. the finance board will make'
the following recmiimendation to the
student body:

 

 

The ﬁnance board recommends
that the tax be placed at ten dol-
lars per person. Since 3 $13,113.87
budget presumes a per capita tax
of $10.85. the board feels that the
eighty-ﬁve cent dlﬂerence be
taken care of in one of the fol-
lowing ways:

1. By dropping some activity or
activities from the budget by a
majority vote of the student body.
so as to bring the budget to $12,-
000.00.

2. By having each activity share
proportionally in cuts from the
budget.

The major item which contributed to

the increase in the budget was football,
which calls for $750.00. Activities which
took cuts were the Dramatic and Art
association. Myskania and the News.
. The board urges that the budget be
passed this week or next in order that
the new board may begin collections
during registration week in the fall.
