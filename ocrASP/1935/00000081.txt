SPOR’1‘ SHOTS

The day has come! Oh. woe are
wet This once infallible barometer
of inaccuracy has at last predicted
correctly. The sophomores did win
the track meet. How those boys
can overcome handicaps.

We always knew it was going to
happen sometime. The law of aver-
ages enters in. Our big shock came
when the tennis team won a match.
On the level. Rumor is that thev’ll
win again at Keene next Thursday.
Brace yourselves.

To complete a harrowing week-
end. the baseball team bangs out a
win. Pitcher Johnnv Cullen (who
should have known better) belted a
home run in addition to his mound
chores. Some people are never sat-
lsﬁed.

Prediction: The seniors will co
next: year's interclass' basketball tro-
phy. By then you should have for-
gotten. But we won’t. Never fear.
