In 1920, Frederick McIntyre Bickcl, a slim,
but very "big-man—owthekampus" Alpha
Delt came out on the steps of his fraternity
house, where the Alpha Delta Phis still dwell
at the University of Wisconsin, to pose for the
yearbook. Now he is Fredric March whose
face has been ﬂashed on motion picture screens
throughout the world.

REDDY BICKEL came to the Badger campus
in 1 6 turn Racine, an earnest, serious

orator and a credit to his father's bank back
home. .He'won the freshman declamation prize;
then Alpha Delta Phi, taming his cowlick, told
him to be happy-go-lucky and try acting. This,
with is face and orator's voice, he found no
hard job- he was soon the best of the thespians
'in the E win Booth Dramatic club.

Chuck Carpenter, football‘captain and Alpha
Delt, could play the piano. Freddy teamed with

uck in campus vau evi |e in an act called
Two Gloom Picklers. They bottled gloom for
three years, even thou h Freddy sang Dardenella
straight and has nevergbeen asked to sing on the
screen since he became Fredric March.

ARPENTER was football captain, so Freddy

ecame manager of the varsity an went

on trips free. He earned them by amusing the

boys at the piano in hotel lobbies on the eves of
big games.

Aided by Gamma Phi Beta sorority, where

Fredric March won the Motion Picture
Academy Award in 1932 for his versatile
“Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde." Last year, in a
newspaper poll, japanese maidens chose him

here was a change in ban management, and an
actor at heart was lost to banking. Fancying the
city, he got Howard Chandler Christy to paint
his profile for collar ads. Then he took his

mother's maiden name, March, and pestered his .

way into a small part in a Broadway show.

N Los Angeles March's Barrymore in The

Royal Family won him a Paramount contract.
His first picture was The Dummy, starring Ruth
Chatterton. On his climb upward he played
twice oppOSIte Clara Bow, once as a college
professor, once as a tough sailor. His prof was
the first genume professor on the screen, and his
sailor was tough. Divorced from his first wife,
he is married to Florence Eldridge, actress, who
has a part in Les Miserables.

He wrote his Madison schoolmates last Home-
coming that he was sorry he couldn‘t get to town:
A very annoying studio production schedule
kept him in Hollywood making screen love to
Anna Stenl

Very, very annoying indeed!
