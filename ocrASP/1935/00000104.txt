The mild cigarette the atbletes smoke
is the mild cigarette for YOU I

A cigarette so mild you can smoke all
you want— that's what athletes say abont
Camels. And when a champion talks
about "condition"—"wind"—-healthy
nerves—real tobacco wildness—he’s got
to know.

Gene Sarazen says: "Playing as much
as I do—l have to keep in condition. I
smoke Camels steadily. They are so mild
they never get my ‘wind'—nevcr upset
my nerves.”

Other athletes back him up. ...“I smoke
all the Camels I want, and keep in top
condition," says Mel Ott, slugger of the
New York Giants... .Gcorgia Coleman,
Olympic diver. says: "Camels don't cut

 

down on my 'wind.’ ”...Bill Miller, oars-
man; Jim Lancaster, N. Y. U.’s 1934
basketball captain; John Skillman, pro
squash racqucts champion—hundreds
of sports stars smoke Camels regularly
and report that Camels never get their
"wind" or nerves.

Wbat Ibis mildness
means to you!

It means you can smoke Camels all you
want! Athletes have made this discovery:
Cnmel's costlier tobaccos are so mild,
they can smoke. all they please. without
disturbing their "wind" or nerves.
