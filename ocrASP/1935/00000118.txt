sornononns AND lll\'Al.llY

The orientation of freshmen further into the ways of
State college will continue tonight at the sophomore
reception to the class of 19:55). At the same time, the
newcomers will be informed as to what they may and
may not. do during the cooling your and more particu-
larly the coming week.

State is the exception rather than the rule in its
conduct toward its entering class. With an aim of
aiding the frcslnncn to build up an affection for their
alma mater instead of making them as miserable as
possible, the umlcrgrluluatcs may well bl' proud of
themselves and put themsclws in a class above those
of the hazing type. 'l‘rue, the sophomores will have
their fun and make the newcomers l'ecl slighlly ridiculous
for a week or so, but; none ol’ it. will ll.'ll\'l‘ onv lusling
effect. The friendly type of rivalry has done as much
to promote lusting friendships as ordinary class
assm-iutions,

State has the happy medium other colleges have
failed to attain. (.‘luss competition aml rivalry without
antagonism can he the only suitable kind for the con

1939—STOP AND CONSIDER

A new era in the lives of three hundred freshmen
opened this week as State absorbed into its student
body the youthful aspirants to the teaching profession.
These embryonic leaders, “the cream of the crop ” of
hundreds of applicants, shoulder a burden which all will
not be able to bear, as records of past years show.

Opportunity has knocked for these three hundred.
Perhaps it has knocked too lightly for some to realize
the significance of it. But to most it will be an oppor-
tunity to satisfy some human desire to be of use in a
world of disorder, discontent and trouble. To some it
is an opportunity for a higher education but not a
definite determination to enter the teaching profession.
And for some it will be four years of easy life, provided
this group survives that long. It is this last group
which generally provides the obstacles to the utopian
ideas which educational leaders have for higher edu-
cation in general.

State provides not a lone opportunity but a varied
number to‘ fit the individual into society in the best
possible way. Members of the teaching profession
cannot: be successful just by acquiring a knowledge, no
matter how complete, of their major and minor subjects
without the ability of mingling with people. Few grad-
uates return to their home towns, and invariably find
themselves in a small place where their success will
depend on their ability to adapt themselves to their
environment. It is not a difﬁcult task to secure such
souial position at State. It is an asset that cannot be
lost once gained.

State has always been proud of its graduates and the
benefits they have rendered to the people of New York
State. You members of the class of 193!) will in four
years’ time join the 'unks of those who have left this
institution. You will be expected to uphold that some
high standard set by your predecessors. it is important
that you think of the future now. 'l‘imc always seems
to be an eternity until it has passed and four years is
but a second in the history of time. lie not the grass-
hopper that sccs but the present but instead imitate the
out with an eye to the future.

A WOlll) ()N lﬂX'l.‘ltA-(dllllil(ll'liAli
Al."l‘l\'l'l‘lll}b‘

To Home who have attended freshman 'ump, the
value of participating in extra-curricular activities has
been stressed to some extent. l’ossibly in some cases
it was over‘emphasizcd in relation to the regular cur-
riculum while in others it was more properly propor-
tioned to its place in the life of a college student.

To some culcring students, participation in ext 'u-
curricular activities means being active in all. This is
probably the most dungcrous inlcrpretation to have, as
students, endeavoring to compete with too large a
number, must necessarily slight their regular college
work. However, the participation in a few activities is
almost a necessity in the securing of u well~ronndcd
education, if not a job in later years.

Success in one or two of the various organizations of
the student association will prove of more value than
a scattering knowledge in a half dozen. The ability
to direct a high school u'tivily is becoming more uml
more n necessary essential lll securing a teaching posi
tion. The opportunity is available for any student at.
Slate provided the student has the ability to choose
wisely.

To help acquaint entering t’rcsluncn, .\clivilics Day
was organized to present the opportunity of entering
some activity in thc t‘ollcge. 'l‘omorrow cuch organiza-
tion will n all itself of the opportunity of helping the
frcsluncn to join some activity. l‘lnch entering
student 'un sec for himself the results each produces
and choose as his interests direct. ()ln'c again, oppor-
tunity knocks.

A NECESSARY REVISION

With the number of men in thlc college now hovcr
ing around the. three hundred mark, the need for some“
kind of an athletic association for men’s sports bccoim-s
more necessary. The rapid devclopnn-nt oi" inlru mural
sports in the last. two years has made the position of
intra-mnrul munugcr one too heavy for a single individual
to shoulder.

The girls ol’ the l'ollcge have u llirls' .\lhlclic lineup
elation which successfully carries on a year round nth-
lolic program, with the burden shared by a number of
capable leadors. Varsity sports for the men are now
regulated by the Athletic. (loilllt'il nml (‘ouch llocwcy.
lint intru-uuirais, which have provided the most good
for the greatest nlnnbcr, is put in the hands of one
man rlho intro-mural manager, This year’s program,
more extensive than any in the past, rcrpilrcs help to
be carried out to a satisfactory end.

An attempt was made this past spring to form a
man’s athletic association which was to include all
sports for man, Varsity sports are ably handled by the
Athletic Council. The best; solution for the romuimlcr
would be to form an association similar to that. now
serving the women of the College, with the intramural
manager at the head and assistant managers t’or each
of the separate sports. Consideration of this fact by

 

the men will be to their best interests.

Leaves of Absence

With the resumption of classes
yesterday, twelve new faculty mem-
bers greeted the students, and ac-
tivcly assumed positions on the State

brought about by retirement, death,
resignations, and several leaves of
absence.

three years a member of the depart-
ment of philosophy of State college,

SPORT SHOTS

l'lullelnjah! Happy days ure here
again! (‘ouch (locwey, fresh and
smiling. has promised us what we’ve
been hinting at this past decade.

No longer will the weak-iimbed,
siow-of-foot, etc., have to take a back
seat for their more gifted brethren.
They, too, will have their chance to
gallop to touchdowns, heave in ﬁeld
baskets, and what have you.

If you can’t play varsity basket-
ball. you can, and brothers, you shall.
pluy intrunmral even if you ‘un‘t
make the fifth team. We’ll have a
sixth.

If you don’t care to block out
tackles, or have your neck broken by
a fullback, you can take up bowling
or tennis. The fatalities in that
direction are very low.

In our three years here. we’ve lis»
lencd to the blcatings of many who
had nothing to do. athletically. Let
them be still. Action is to be had
for everyone. liven this pillar of
truth may be seen pructi 'ully any day

Coach Goewey to Inaugurate New
Deal in Men’s Athletic Program

A 'aricty of sports and the inclu-
sion of every man in the college arc
the two chief objectives in the men’s
athletic program which Coach Irving
(locwey desires to institute into State

college this year. (.‘oach erwcy
succeeds Coach Rutherford linker

who resigned last. year.

The new mentor is a firm believer
that. in preparing future teachers,
sports are iinportuut in order to offer
them a recreational side of their job.
Active participation in athletics will
not only keep a teacher physically tit
but will aid him in commandng the
respect of his strident body. In order
to attain his objectives, the coach
will provide opportunities for every
man to indulge in some form of sport
which he can continue on through the
years after g‘uduution, for example,
golf, tennis, swimming, and bowling.

This program will by no means do-
tract from the intercollegiate compe-
tition of varsity teams but will 'alhcr
elevate the universal physical educa-
tion to a primary position in the
sports curriculum. In fact Couch
(ioew’cy intends to conduct coaching
classes instructing prospective roaches
ill the t'umlmm-nluls of all major
sports it' enough men are interested.
These classes will be conducted for-
mally at set hours ruther than lll
haphazard fashion.

As regards football, the ('oach .Il
vunccd several very practical reasons
why, with things as they are, u rigor-
ous varsity schedule would be not
only impractical bill impossible. lle
intends to have intru-innrul touch
football aml will have inlru-mnrul
orthodox football if the assembly
wi~hc.~ to ~pcml la.~l year’s foolbull
appropriation for equipment. Ilow‘»
l‘\I'l', the coach would prefer to have
lhe money turned intolhc inli'u mural
program. With this introduction to
football and the increasing number
of men in the college it may be pos
sible to work up to a varsity in a
few years. The (‘oilch is not coil-
dcmuing football blil sensibly realizes
that >1ll'll u rigorous sport requires
preparation, a sullicient

number of players, proper equipment
and gradual building up.

Coach Goewcy, a, former high
school principal, well realizes the
tremendous advantages a teacher who
is able to handle sports as well as
regular curricula has over the ordi—
nary tcuchcr not prepared along
these lines. “A teacher can easily
gain the respect: and admiration of
students through athletic ability and,
by teaching them the code of sports-
manship, do more to develop char-
acter than he could in the classroom,”
says Coach (iocwey.

Couch Goewcy has outlined an
ideal physical education prog‘um for
State college. The success of the
piogram is now in the hands of the
men. They have what they have been
asking for; it remains to be seen
what they shall do with it.
