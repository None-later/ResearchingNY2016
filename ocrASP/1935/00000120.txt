COMING EVENTS CAST THEIR SHADOWS

The student association, through its constitution, is
gchn the powcr to pass legislation to provide for
income to support its activities. Last May, by an over-
whclming vote of this body, a budget slightly in lm'oss
of thirteen thousand dollars was upprovod. 'l‘ho pcr
cnpitn tux usscssod was ten dollars.

’l‘o dnto, littlo more than lil'ty-livo pcr ocnt of this
amount has boon collected. The purposc of thc blldgol
has been dcfcntcd and oncll notivity will again bc forced
to curtail its program. 'l‘llosc who hnvc loynlly sup-
ported thcir obligations must bo forced to ncccpt only
ﬁfty-ﬁve per cent of tho rotllrns thoy originally cx-
pectcd from their invostmcnt.

Right cnl'orcclucllt of tllo pcnultios for non-pnynlont
of the tax may prod tho dolilupnhlts. Hnspcnding \'ot~
ing privileges, expulsion from ollicc nnd \-.\‘olllsloll from
all activities are possiblc on nl'lloll by tho Studcnt
Council.

FOOTBALL AND INTRA-MURALS

Popular approval during the past year from the
student association for the revival of football as a
varsity sport resulted in the inclusion in the last student
budget of an appropriation for this sport. However, no
matter how much enthusiasm may prevail, no matter
how experienced a coaching staff there may be for the
sport, if there is not the experienced material of the
right kind available, the experiment is due for a short
life only.

Statements from men with a thorough knowledge of
football have been practically unanimous in the opinion
that it will be impossible to establish this sport without
some kind of seasoning of material for at least a your
or two. This obviously condemns the sport as one of
varsity calibre for this year. This does not mean, how-
ever, that there cannot bc any of this sport at State
this fall.

With an eye to the future when State may place on
the ﬁeld a team worthy to bear the name of the College,
this team “ to be” can be founded in the intra-lnural
program where it will be of the greatest good to the
greatest number. Inclusion in this program will provide
experience and knowledge of the sport for at least ﬁfty
men, and continuing for at least two or three years,
there will be even lnorc than this number available and
with experience. Then, and then only, can .Stntc put
a team in the intercollegiate football field.

Meanwhile, intro-mural football will need an appro-
priation if it is to be included III the program. If
varsity football is to be nbandonod, what better use
may be made of this sum than to add it to the intra-

linances and tile sole source of income for each of the
classes is from its own members. These class assess-
ments are not compulsory but must result from the
willingness of each freshman to push his class to the

 

top. ’30, you haven’t had a chance to show yourselves
yct. Make a grand entrance when you do.

 

'rn E (JOSSAL‘KS llE’l‘llltN

The return ot’ the Don Cossacks may well be con-
sidered as another feather in tllc hat for Music asso-
ciation in bringing this popular group ngnin to State
college. Accordcd a tremendous reception on their ﬁrst
visit, their return is looked t‘orwnrd to with expectation
and doligllt.

This presentation serves an cxcollcnt example of two
l.hings—~llrst, it is made possible through the student
tax, and sccond, it is an example of what really worth-
wllilo entertainment can be and is brought to this
collcgc. ldncll goes hand in haml as a result of the
ooopcrntion of the students in the payment of this
annual for.

This chorus is but the llrst ot’ the lnnny cntcrt.:lin-
mouts Music association and .Drumntics and Art asso-
cinlion hope to bring to this institution. All students

 

mny socul'c admission to any or all of. those t'onturos
through their tax tickets, and the prices of admission
to those alone will b0 a good part of the ten dollars.

it is wise to save monoy. This is one way.

The spirit of getting an education at the expense of
tho state has recently turned into getting a livelihood
at the expense of ono’s follow students. Many have had
the misfortunc slllco collcgc commenced this full to be
the victims of those with loss honorable ldcus on how to
live with others.

The thefts have been not only of money bllt of books
and clothes as wall. For such a condition to prevail is
to cast a reputation on State no other institution cares
to how: known outside its walls. For this group, we
wish them a rapid enrollment in an institution whose
onl collegiate reputation is that in the sport of football
ulnfrestrictcd dormitory rules.

In this one volume Aloxundor Crosby has solcclcd

'l‘on yours, 1925 to lililﬁ, with ll nowspnper man nlld

of this llmllt. No dully journnlisl is morc courngcous;
no journalist comments on such vnricd topics and yet
l'uluins commnnd ot’ lllc subjcot llnd holds his rondcr’s
intorost.

()no cssny from tho middle of this cxtl‘omcly invigorat-

his “just around lllo cornor now deal" was a bit late.
