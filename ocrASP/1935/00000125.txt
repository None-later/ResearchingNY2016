‘ Most song writers usual y remain anonymous over
the air—while the orchestra gets the credit.
Privately and publicly, Mildred Bailey, the Rock!
ing Chair Lady, who used to sing ﬂaming torches with
Paul Whiteman, reverently remembers Hoagy for
his Old Rocking Chair. When Al Jolson first went on
the air, he relied heavily on LazyBones, and that was
'one of Hoagy's tunes. too.
Hoagy. himself is an ascetic, sad’faced gentleman.
Unlike most radio and screen celebrities (who began
' college) Hoa'gy actually did get the law degree all
the others seemed to start out to get before joining an
orchestra and leaving—and Hoagy had an orchestra,,
too. This is a matter of pride to Kappa Sigma, the
fraternity Carmichael joined soon after he entered the
University of Indiana in 192.0. There, in the famous
Indiana Book Nook, Hoca‘gy used to make his class'
mates weep as he play the original Old Rocking
Chair, so sad a composition that his publishers made
him tone its tragic lyrics down.

WHEN Carmichael ﬁnished Indiana in 1926, he
had a law degree and a reputation for really

He sa I told his 'orchestra boys that from now on he
was a awyer. A year later he came back from a
Florida law office, reorganized the orchestra, and

began to use a melody called Stardust as his si nature
song. That song was published; and Hoagy eft the
orchestra to spend all of his time working out the
tunes that troubled his sad soul. You knowvthem:
Georgia on My Mind, One Morning in May, Moon
Country, Snowball, and many other mournful plaints
that made music publishers glad. His last song was
Judy. Hoagy has many more lachrymose reﬂections
on romance and the Southland which'he saw so
brieﬂy as a barrister in Florida. You'll hear from him
some more.

WHEN NBC wants a professorial touch to its
programs, John B. Kennedy becomes the narr
rator. John B. Kennedy has the positive and sure
voice of dignity. He thought so when he was a student
at St. Louis University before the Great War.
His great opportunity to show it came when he was
scheduled to appear on a platform in the college quad
with two other students. They were oing to tell
just why they thought Woodrow Wi son, Teddy
Roosevelt, and Howard Taft should be the next

president. In this exercise m Civics, John B. was to
speak in behalf of President Taft. ' He walked in, gave
his speech; then locked the others out of the hall.
Taft lost St. Louis, Missouri, and the election. In
1913, the next year, however, John B. was graduated
with honors from St. Louis University. '

After working on newspapers in St. Louis, Chicago,
and Montreal, John B. Kennedy became an associate
editor of Collier's magazine. He specialized in writing
breezy interviews With stage and screen celebrities.
Kennedy was a man of the world, and he knew how to
keep out too much breathless adoration of the great.

IN 1924 Collier's decided to buy an hour on NBC.
John B. Kennedy was the staff orator. and easily
got the job of putting on the program. He doesn't
write anything anymore, except radio lines for him'
self. You may rave heard him with Lawrence Tibbett
last year. This winter he is appearing over NBC
with a big cast that will dramatize the day's news
on the air. John B. Kennedy will be there to comment
