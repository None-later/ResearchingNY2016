Greeks Are Hosts
To 160 Freshmen

’l‘hc sororities of State college on-
tortaiaed about one hundred sixty
frcslnncn at the annual Inter-sorority
'l‘ea conducted Saturday in the Page
hall gymnasium.

'l‘ablcs were arranged along the
sides of the gym for each sorority
in the order of their founding, with
l‘lta l’hi presiding at the place of
honor because of the position as presi-
dent of’ the Council. Decorations
consisted of ﬂowers and the individual
banners at the sororities.

Guests of the sororities besides the
freshmen included Dean Helen

For the benefit of those who have
been wondering just what the new
library murals are and why, the News
sleuth has been on the job, gathering
evidence on the subject. it seems
that they are a part of the Federal
Emergency Relief administration’s
plans to help out the artists of these
United States. hi this case, the artist
is William B. Van lngen of New
York city, creator of the murals in
the Federal buildings in the Canal
Zone, and also in Chicago.

The paintings, when completed, will
form a historical group, representing
events in Albany and New York state
since its early exploration. Of the
two already in place, the llrst, seen
as one enters the library, is of early
Albany, then known as Beaverwyck.
The town received its name from the
beaver dam pictured in the left fore-
ground of the picture. In the dis-
tance is shown one of the wind-mills
used in colonial days. The sleeps in
the background are typical of the
small sail-boats used to carry pas-
sengers aml freight on the Hudson
during this period.

At the right is State Street as it
was in the first half of the eighteenth
century. Taken from a print of the
same time, the picture shows costumes
aml customs of the day. The busy
street we know was then nothing but
a grassy path.

Further panels will be added as they
are completed. Over the library on—
trance will be a portrayal of the Half
Moon entering the harbor at Fort
Orange. 0n the recess of the wall
over Miss Cobb’s otlicc the Van Reus-
selaer manor house will be Iiicturcd.
The Senate House at. Kingston, where
the United States Senate once met.
will be another subject. At the far
end of the library, over Miss Kirk-
patrick’s oflicc, will be painted a rep-
resentation of the junction of the
Erie Canal and the Hudson River, in
the nineteenth century. Other themes
will concern the early railroad devel—
opment of the state, and the first
Albany Normal school buildings.

Resolution To Be

The resolution introduced in last
Friday‘s student assembly will be
voted on Friday, October :25. its

’37 Red and White Banner
Disappears at Reception

The class of 1937’s red and
white bmmer disappeared at the
Junior reception to the freshmen
last Friday night. Whether or
not some llip Van Winkle of the
class of 1030 or 1038 has not
found out that the rivalry days
of the cl:le of Hill? are over is
tlze mystery facing junior class
ollicials. 'l'he olliccl's believe that
someone outside of State college
i-l l'cspon»~ihle for the loss of the
lnzn'rl‘.

Alice Allard. president of the
class. plans to advertise widely
the value of the class symbol,
and t’..~l\' or its return. “The
person or persons who took the
banner did not realize that their
act was not a joke but a major
thel'l.” Miss Allard stated.
