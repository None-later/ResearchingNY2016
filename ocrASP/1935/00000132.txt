bia College in 1790.
INSPIRED by the success of the ﬁrst four colleges,

ﬁve others took root before the Revolution inter!
rupted all formal education on our shores. Benjamin
Franklin's, radically unvchurchly University of Penn,
sylvania and New York‘s Episcopalian but prev
greasive King's College demonstrated their mutual
tolerance b jointly collecting funds in London.
Somewhat ter Samson Occum. of the Mohican
tribe, was performing that service in England and
Scotland for Eleazar Wheelock's struggling Dart—
mouth. .

Still primarily theological seminaries, Ba tist Brown
"d Dutch Reformed Rutgers reﬂected t e changing
manners, the ﬂourishing trade and wealth of their
world, in more liberal purposes and methods. Chart
tered as Rhode Island College and queens, both were
soon re'named after important benefactors.

Of Franklin’s university no buildings remain.
Rutgers was weak and Dartmouth poor, and none
that lasted were built until after the War. The only
trace of King‘s College‘s ﬁrst hall is in an en raving of
1790, when it was already re‘baptiaed Columbia in
honor of Christoforo Colombo.

BROWNS original University Hall still stands,
' only very slightly altered. John Brown, pioneer
oversaw shipping magnate. himself laid its corner,
stone in 1770 and ave liqui encoura ement to the
workmen when eac ﬂoor an the me was ﬁnished.

But the colle e was named for a Brown of the next
generation, w 0 gave more lasting gifts.

Typical of the years just before the Revolution is
the long, roofvtopping balustrade seen in both old
prints. In both the cupola seems especially spindly
and graceless. If Brown has too few accents of gables
and portals to enliven its front, Columbia has too
many. Where Brown’s middle is marked by an ext
aggerated projection, Columbia, lacking it, is without
a unifying center of interest.

Still on its original grounds, Brown is not seriously
pressed for space, although the President's House
(demolished in August) had to be removed from
the campus some years ago. Columbia has felt the
space problem more acutely than any other of our
Colonial colleges. When the old print was made it
had already moved (in i756l from near Trinity Church
to the "outskirts"—~~what is now Park Place. The
"outskirts" to which the college moved in 1857 was
the region around Madison Avenue and 49th Street.

Since 1897. Columbia has stood on her fourth site,
where her new domed Roman magniﬁcence stands in
vivid contrast both to her unpretentious Colonial
beginnings and the modern motorized millieu.

This is the fourth in a series of exclusive articles on
American College Architectmc. ‘I' he fifth. to appear
next week, will discuss the beginnings and buildings of
Rutgers, Dartmouth and Dickinson.
