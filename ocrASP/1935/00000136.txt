“VIIRGINIANS have souls to be saved as well as
Englishmen," argued the Rev. James Blair at
the Court of King William and Queen Mary in 1692. .
One of only twelve clergymen among 15,000 Virv
ginians, he was ﬁghting for a badly’needed divinity
school for the South. '

“Damn their souls. Let them make tobacco," his
plea was curtly snubbed in London.

Back in Virginia the iron'handed governor, Sir
William Berkeley, had gone on record with “I thank
God that there are no free schools nor printing. and I
hope we shall not have them these hundred years."
Later, he contributed personally to the divinity school
that is now the College of William and Mary at
Williamsbur .

"Lamentaﬁle indifference“, if not stubborn resistr
ance, was met on every hand. But black as the pros
pects for a college seemed in 1692, an amazing reversal
was just around the corner.

IN 1693. William and Mary chartered the institution,
granting a fabulous cash endowment of well over
