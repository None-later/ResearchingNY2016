1918 News Files Reveal Origins
of Frosb—Soph Rivalry Rules

“The boys could have a ‘bnll push’
on the campus, using a very much
enlarged football or basketball.”
Thus the .1918 News files disclose the
suggestion of the student. body for
the beginning of definite inter-class
rivalry traditions at State college.
This mild statement. lends humor
when we consider the rough and
tumble event which has become an
annual tradition on Campus and
Moving-up (lays.

Through the ensuing years, t‘rosb-
soph sings, debates, and stunts have
grown up. The competitive cuss
stunts were conducted for some time
on the College steps due to the lack
of auditorium space.

At present there are compact pro-
visions in the student. association eon-
stitution for inter-class rivalry rules.
The pushball contest for boys and
for girls of the sophomore and fresh-
man classes will give two credits each
to the winning team.

Sometime (lilting the ﬁrst semester
one class challenges the other to either
a debate or ll. sing, the remaining
event: to take place the second semes-
ter. On November 1, banner rivalry
begins—the llllll' when “friendly
enemies” battle in the halls. Rivalry
basketball games for both boys and
girls carry one credit cncb.

Freshmen haven’t been to college
until they have participated in mascot
llnnt, when the sophs hide a small
china dog somewhere ill the college
buildings. Whether they ﬁnd it or
not really doesn’t matter, for the fun
of rummaging in dusty collars and
attics with their classmates is an ex-
perience not to be forgotten.

On Moving-up (lay, a pnsbbnll cen-
test for the men, obstacle races for
the women, a. sing, and stunts, add
greatly to the general excitement of
this much-awaited day. And then, at
night, comes the announcement of the
winner of the coveted inter-class
rivalry cup. Who will it be this year?

Will State Femininity Bow
To Masculine Maulers?

Are the women of State to be
rudely mauled, bruised and other-
wise painfully torn limb from
limb, or will their training from
past associations with football
bruisers, noon-time dancing, and
other social alfairs defend them
from having their fair beauty de-
formed for tonight’s entertain-
ment at the Aurania club?

The impending menace is a
hockey game between a group of
graduate men and a girls’ team
in charge of Helen Clyde and
Elizabeth Morozowski, juniors, to
be played at. 1:10 o’clock this
afternoon on the campus in front
of ’ngc ball. Members of thc
men’s team are graduates of Dart-
mouth, Reussclncr Polytechnic ill-
stitutc, 'l‘cmplc, (‘lnrkson, and
.\lidd|(~l.nu'y, ulany of whom blue
played on the varsity football
teams of their respective colleges.

Like a Supreme (‘ourt decision
on the New Deal, this struggle
should show what our State Allia-
zous can do.
