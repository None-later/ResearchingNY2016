What Big Bill Tilden has to say '1rcy R.
about Camels is worth any smoker’s mac:
attention.‘ " Playing hard, competi-  C.
tive tennis day after day,- I’ve got y' E.
to keep in tiptop physical condi- nirley M. 
tion," says the 42-year-old "Iron ulnry ’I‘. 
Man of Tennis." "I smoke Camels, s A, .l
the mild cigarette. They don’t get ,1 ‘
my wind or upset my nerves. I've m M.
smoked Camels for years, and 1 “mm,
never tire of their smooth, rich "m, I,_
taste! Camels must be made from mm?“
choicer tobaccos to be so mild and My R.
taste so good!" And other tennis
stars. . .Lester Stoefen, George Lott, ima-
and Bruce Barnes . . . agree with W"
Big Bill about smoking Camels. 80 more
turn to Camels for steady smoking. ~'
You’ll like their mildness too!
