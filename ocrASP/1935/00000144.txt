For the second time since the

The selection of Signmn Laudis is

the highest four per cent of the class,
and after the mid-year examinations
students will be added to bring the
number up to ten per cent of the class
if this ten per cent has an average
above 2.00. This average is computed
by dividing the honor points earned
by a student by his credit points.

Professors’ "Guinea Pigs”
React Favorably in 'Ed’ 5

Cigarette “blindfold tests” and
student demonstrations of emo-
tions were among the psychology
experiments conducted in the Edu-
cation 5 courses this week.

Alonzo Dumont, ’37, was able
to guess correctly three out of four
of the brands of cigarettes used.
But when Donald DcSerio, ’37,
guessed only one out of four and
Walter Rogers, ’37, guessed none,
the general inaccuracy of the senses
was pr '.'C(l to Dr. French’s
“psych” enthusiasts.

Another group conducted tests
which showed that the exact na-
ture of an emotion is hard to
determine when observed apart
from its cause. After Dr. Ilicks
had finished experimenting with
the class, members decided to ex-
periment on him. Dr. Ilicks said
he believed that the two missiles
hurled at him without warning (lid
produce the. expected emotion of
surprise.
