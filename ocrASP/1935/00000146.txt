lower part . . . snubmosed adults are victims of
stunted nose owth before adolescence . . . the
eyeball is its 1‘ e'time size at four . . . hence the need

Q It you have searched for cigarette mildness, mark the words of
George Lost, the tennis champion. and the '7-goal polo star, Cyril
Harrison. “Camels.” says Mr. Harrison, "are so mild they don't upset
the nerves or afect the wind. And when I'm tired I get a 'lift' with
a Camel.” And Lott adds: "I understand that more expensive tobac-
cos are used in Camels. They are gentle on the throat. And Camels
never get my wind." Turn to Camels and enjoy to the full the pleas-
ure that comes from millin- tohuoos.

 

O Camels are made from liner, MORE
BXPBNSIVB TOBAccos—Turkish and
Domestic—than any other popular brand.
