 aﬁ'airs were radically different in

1803  Dickinsttn's- “Old West College" was
built. j The imposin talents of Benjamin Hen
Latrobe  engaged to design it, between in

vaster.  in architecture and engineering for

Philade his and Baltimore. In fact, Latrobe was one

 ofa ha ﬁdozen more or less trained architects who

came from En land, France, Ireland, and the Bahamas
and stru among themselves for authority to
impress t ' own personalities upon the design of
the national Capitol at Washington.

But no trace of Latrobe's polished GrecoRoman
taste is found in the rough masonry or the unadorned,
traditional composition of “Old West“ unless it be
the‘lower portions. Not a glimmer of his sparkling
originality—which produced the coran and to
baccoleaf ornament in Washington—radiates from
the positively primitive cupola. The prominent half,
round window over the door was common property
around 1800.

Architect or none. however, Dickinson's “Old
West" shares the virtues and limitations of Colonial
college buildings which “Time has consoled" as a
reward for their straightforward reﬂection of their
time and place.

RUTGERS in 1809 is the ﬁrst college to show the
architect's careful study. He was the mysterious
John McComb, a native American, of whom little is
known except that he was also engaged in building
New York's Old City Hall. '

product. But studied design is soon apparent in every
detail. The cornice, subtly "broken," follows the
slight projection of the ends. For emphasis the middle,
with its entrance, is marked by four large ﬂat pilasters
which seem to support the gable above. The cupola
is of a hitherto unknown stability and fullness of
form. The ground ﬂoor is “treated
literally a base for the "composition"—all more or
less French ideas, which were then prevalent.

Judging by what is left today, Rutgers proﬁted
more ram her architect’s advice than did Dickinson.
But the Colonial tradition, ruling alone at Dart-
mouth, was still virile everywhere. Traces of it
remain as a stabilizing inﬂuence 'all through the
architecturally troubled 19th Century.
