Slime—Willie Macfarlane!

Their names sound a roll call of
sense moments that have made golf-
ing history, when prime "condi-
tion" and healthy nerves were at a
premium. All are outspoken in their
preference for Camels. ,

“Camels are so smooth and mild
they never affect my wind,” says
Craig Wood, pictured at the right
as he paused to smoke a Camel.
Willie Macfarlane adds: "Camels
are mild. They don't get my wind.”
Miss Helen Hicks brings up the
feminine viewpoint. “There’s 3 del-
icacy of ﬂavor in Camels that ap-
peals to women. Camels never inter-
fere with one's wind." And Denny
Shure says: "I switched to Camels
years ago. I smoke them constantly,
without upsetting my nerves or dis-
turbing my wind."

You’ll Like Tbeir Mildness Too!

Such experiences with Camels can
be matched right among your own
friends. You'll like Camels too.
Camels are made from costlier ro-
baccos. They never tire your taste.

 YOU CAN SMOKE.

In every-day life, physical lit-
ness plays a big part too.
Life's more fun when you feel
good. So mark what chamc
plons and star athletes say:
Camels don't get their wind
and don't rullle their nerves.
That's real mildness. Try
Camels yourself. and share
in the enjoyment of Camel's
mellow ﬂavor that means so
much to others.
