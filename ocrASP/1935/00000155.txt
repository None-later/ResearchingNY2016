of Executive Body, Is Head
of Athletic Program

Gerald Amyot, ’36, will head the
Men’s Athletic association for the
coming year as a result of his election
as chairman of the Board of Directors
of the association \\’cdnesday night.

Edward Kramer, ’36, was elected in
Friday’s assembly to be the repre-
sentative of the Student association
to the M.A.A. Board of Directors.

At the meeting, the organization
of the M.A.A. was completed, and
plans formulated for their program
and activities throughout the 1035—6
season. The executive committee,
which is composed of the permanent
member of the council, Couch W.
Irving Goewey, director of athletics,
.and Ainyot, chairman of the Board
of Directors, was completed when
Amyot appointed Thomas Harrington.
’37, as the junior uieiubcr of the
committee. All committees function-
ing in the M.A.A. will be directly
accountable to the executive conimiiv
too for their activities. These will
include intra-niural, iinance. basket-
ball, cross-country and tennis. base-
ball, schedule, and any other commit-
tees of the association. “.\ll sports

tures especially,” Amyot stated. llc
fill'lllt“ added that 'i'icsliuicii athletics
in particular will be supervised by
the association.

The program for the freshmen for
this year, a change in policy from
former years, will include :i Sl‘llt'illllt‘
of freshman basketball games which
will be played as preliminaries to the
varsity games. This will add a iicw
character to the preliminaries which
have been insigniﬁcant and iiuatirac
live under the system used i'ormcrly,
was the opinion oi’ Amyot. .\t the
same time, the i'rcshman schedule
will include i'ewer games away from
liouic. Admission to tho prcliminarics
will be by student tax ticket in the

Three Men and a Watch
Prove Honesty Is Best

Samuel Silvormnn, ’36, presi-
dent of Commerce club and chair-
man of the commercial exposition,
wore a big suiile of satisfaction
and content this past week as ii.
result of a prominent State junior
meeting up with a strayed wrist-
watch and returning the wonder-
iiig article to its owner.

it all happened when one of the

exhibitors laid aside a wristwatch
in the men’s wash room and for-
got to take the time-ticker with
him. James Vanderpoe], ’37,
came upon the aforementioned ar-
l‘iclc and handed it to Silverinan,
who meanwhile had received word
of tile loss from the exhibitor.
. owner gladly exchanged the
watch for a check in the way of
a rcward for State’s honesty, which
.\lcssengcr Silverinan turned over
to \'andcrpoel. IiiVL‘l'yUllC was sat-
isiied, thouin Silverniaii had to be
content with spiritual satisfaction
compared to Vaiiderpiwl’s mate-

SPORT SHOTS

 

 

 

A frenzied check-up on the part
of our secret service system reveals
that. 99 44/100% of our manhood is,
or are (underline correct verb)
busily building up the body. The
process varies with the individual
(Ed 5 is not lost: on everyone).

Some hardy souls boot a deceased
pig all over the campus at daybreak
twice weekly. The more talented of
our brethren sweat and strain on
one of our many basketball squads.

Still others, gentler souls at heart,
seek refuge in the more peaceful
pastimes. e.g., swimming, badminton,
ping-pong, mid what have you. At
this point there is much ground for
debate as to whether or not swim-
ming should be classed with the
gentler sports. We for one have
a deﬁnite opinion on the matter.

All this frenzied scramble for
muscle will blossom forth some Sun-
day in the near future for a return
rugby (football to you) match with
the Beavers. We haven’t learned
our lesson yet, but we have a fairly
good idea.

Meanwhile i‘oacli (locwey is franti-
cally drilling our hopefuls for their
basketball debut with R. l’. l. The
outlook is far from cheery. but
rumor has it (aml as far as we’re
concerned, can keep it.) that the class
of 1030 has helped ‘cousidei'iibly.
Even so \\c are pessimistic. We
haven’t yet worked up the courage
to predict the score. liiit we wince
when we think of it.

“in my mind the woman who

years ago this week. Times and

to Indifference

Among the commentaries on the
morals oi‘ this latter iige are these
hits, gleaned by the inquiring reporter
at 1935:

“People don‘t think about it any
more; they just do it,” admits
Augusta Katz, ’36.

“it depends on the girl, how she
smokes some do it gracci’ully; oilicrs
don’t,” slatcs .\licluicl (lrilliu, ’36.

Ralph Altman, ’36, reverses the
continuity of history, however, dc-
clariug tlial a girl smoking “gives

word ‘mislcading,’ ” (‘llcuii l'ngcrer,
