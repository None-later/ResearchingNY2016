STATE’S UNDERGROUND RAILWAY

Once again those in power have glanced at the cool-
ing breezes without and considered carefully the wel«
fare of the hundreds of individuals who daily wend
their way to Hawley library. The result will he plans
ing to many of those who have hurriedly scainpered
across the peristyle to the warmth of the building in
these shortening days. The stairway by the entrance to
the Commons is now open for use.

]'[o\vevcr, it has brought its problem. Any noise made
on these stairs seems to magnify and echo throughout
the room. There lms always been the possible excusable
reverberation of those falling up or down the narrow
passageway to cause suﬂicicnt disturbance by one
person. But, many have failed to realize the additional
puudcmouium caused by those talking and laughing at
the. bottom of the passage. A vote of thanks will be
extended by the students in the library if they will
tiuish any conversation in the Commons bct'orc unmat-
ing the stairs to silence.

With all sincerity, the author with lil'i ltnssinn back
ground has written an incredible story with plain stoic

The ﬁrst play Tuesday night, 111-
though it vas a delightful fantasy,
failed to get across as well as it
might have cleric. There was a cer-
tain slowness of one, and monotony of
speech and mood, that stifled any
rising action.

The set, with its well-workcd-out
plan of red, white, and black, was
very effective. But it seemed to us
that. the two ehcckerboards in the
background (one of which had an
unfortunate and disconcerting tilt)
drew more attention than the actors.
They made deﬁnite limits to an al-
rendy well-tilled stage, and gave a
crowded appearance to the set.

Miss Hall, a newcomer to State’s
Stage, gave the most convincing char-
acterization. She, was very graceful,
moved about the stage with ease. Her
voice, however, was a trifle heavy at
times for the. role. Would she be
