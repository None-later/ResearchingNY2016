Lieutenant Commander Frank
Hawks, U. S. N. IL, famous
holder of 214 speed records
and the Harmon Trophy, says:
“I’ve been ﬂying for 19 years
and smoking Camels almost as
long. Making speed records
tests the pilot as well as his
plane. Camels never make me
jumpy or bother my physical
'condition' in any way. As the
athletes say, Camels are so
mild they don’t get the wind.
And I’ve found they never
upset my nerves. Camel must
use choicer tobaccos."

"Speaking of cigarettes, I
make it a rule to smoke
Camels,” says Mrs. T. W.
Kenyon. sportswoman pilot.
"They are the mildest ciga-
rette I know. Morning, noon,
and night, I can smoke
Camels steadily. They never
upset my nerves. And each
Camel renews the zest and
enjoyment of the last one!"

“I appreciate the mellow
ﬂavor of Camels,” says Sir
CharlesKiogsford-Smith,the
transpaciﬁc ﬂyer (right), in
a recent interview. "Camels
refresh me so when I'm fa-
tigued." he continues. "and
they are so mild that I can
smoke any number without
throwing my nerves olfkey."

"I smoke Camels all I want," says
Col. Roscoe Turner (right), 'cross-
continent speed ace. “Because of
their mildness, Camels never tire
my taste. A speed ﬂyer uses up energy
just as his motor uses 'gas.’ After
smoking a Camel, I get a 'reﬁll’ in
energy—a new feeling of vim and
well-being."
