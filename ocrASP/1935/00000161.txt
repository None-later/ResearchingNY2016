Old Territorial Building (1840)

THE vogue for Greek architectural forms came in the
period when cities were named Athens, Corinth,

Sparta, Troy, and Ypsilanti. early in the 1800s. Both ’
fads lingered long after, but most of the early, enthir .

siastica y Greek college buildings have been either

destroyed or “corrected” by more academic and
sophisticated generations.

   w. The Greek Revival in

- '7‘ " architecture followed the.

‘ publication of drawings of.

Greek temples, just as the

. earlier Roman revival of

Jefferson and his circle had

resulted from the study of -

Roman structures. Both rev
vivals ﬂourished on
sides of the Atlantic.

Greg, is still the largest Corinthian temple in the
wor .

BUT the pure temple form was soon abandoned by

American builders. Greek temples had no need
for windows nor for usable interior arrangements.
Their shoebox sha was almost impossible to man-
age, so far as day ight and convenience were com
cerned. In short, the temple form was impractical for
modern conditions a hundred years ago.

'So a com romise was reached. The potent old
Colonial tra ition of box‘like halls was Greekiiied by
the addition of a temple'like portico or frontispiece.
The portico could project timidly or boldly and still '

is solution, modiﬁed colonial cupola and all,
soon found its way to Iowa. The old Territorial Build-
ing. built for the legislature in 1840, passed into the
hands of the University of Iowa soon after. .

The Universit of Delaware's ﬁrst building, finv
ished in 1834. a heres to the southern traditions of
warm red brick. an imposing entrancerstairway, and
somewhat heavier (more Roman!) proportions. But
eloquent of GrecoRoman fashion is the digniﬁed
triad of Doric porches.

This is the seventh in an exclusive series on American Colle
Architecture. The eighth, to appear nest week, will discus's
Gothic revival.
