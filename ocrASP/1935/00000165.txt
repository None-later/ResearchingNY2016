Lounge Will Open
To Accommodate

I l
Specral Functions
The Lounge at Richardson hall,
one-time resting place and eardroom
for all generations, will be utilized
this year only for special functions,
accordng to Mary Lion, ’37, who has
been chosen chairman of the Lounge
committee. In view of the present
place of the Commons in college
activities and the possible addition
of new furniture to the Lounge, such
procedure is considered advisable.
The Lounge committee is trying to
induct a more. vital interest in Lounge
teas, which are to be carried on ex-
tensively throughout the waiter
months, by varied programs of exhi~
bition and entertainment and the
creation of a more social atmosphere.
The committees assisting Miss Pillll
are: assistant chairman MiirJorie
Adams, ’36; arrangements Nina
Ullnian, ’36; programs, Ilnldah Clas-
sen, 36; decorations Marian Shultes,
’37, and publicity, Elisabeth lIobbie,

’36.

Scholarship Checks To Be
Christmas Issue This Year

“Scholarship checks will be
given out December 16,” says Mr.
C. J. Deyo, college treasurer.

“You don’t say,” sigh three
hundred amazed holders in unison.

The sigh as uttered by fresh-
men is one of breathless anticipa—
tion, like the night before Christ-
mas. Doctors agree that the
anticipation of both scholarship
cheeks and Christmas very often
raises the blood pressure of col-
lege freshmen above the normal.
’l‘hcv hasten to add, however,
that arteriosclerosis rarely results.

The sigh of upperclassmen is
one of plain reliet’. Most upper-
classmeii have their checks spent
long before they get them, ac,-
coi'diiig to the. well known 1.0.U.
system. One student last year
siifl‘ered a nervous breakdown be-
