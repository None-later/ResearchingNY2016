An Unintormed Teacher
Is Still A Teacher

“ We could argue about it all night and never get any-
where. Nobody knows anything about it anywny.”—-—h‘inal
word in a bull session on politics, economics, or foreign
aifnlrs.

Maybe you’re tired of it, too.

Some day we should like to see someone ques-
tion this “ﬁnal” word—someone who would
wisecrack and say, “It’s about time you did
know something about it.”

If someone got up in Chem club meeting and
asserted that nobody knew anything about chem-
istry, people would gather immediately that the
speaker was merely trying to cover up his own
lack of information. Yet in the ﬁeld of human
relations, which every citizen should know be-
cause he has to vote, people can excuse their
own ignorance by blaming everybody else, and
get away with it.

We take it for granted that the ﬁeld of social
studies—the study of men’s relations with each
other—is in toto so extensive as to defy ﬁnal
analysis. But the chemist in the laboratory
doesn’t understand all the secrets of the atom
either. He knows what he knows and gets
results, and doesn’t go around cxcusing himself
like some teachers of future citizens are inclined
to do.

State college students will have an opportu-
nity in the next two weeks to become informed
on political and international aii’airs, through
the visit of Mr, Forster and the political dis-
cussions being planned by student council.
’l‘hroughout the year the council, the Young
Wonlcn’s Christian association, the l’cncc club,
and the international Relations cilib plan to co-
operate in making State informed on issues of
the day. The success of thcsc attempts will
be in direct proportion to the attendance and
attention at each function.

An unini'ormcd chemist. is not: exactly a chcm-
ist, but an uniui'ormcd teacher is still a teacher,
not for better but for worse.

The Stunts Are Here Again

We lookcd up ilic directors oi' the scuio' and
junior (.‘nmpus Day stunts and l'ound that their
productions promise to bc {/oml.

We looked up the scniors and juniors for
the reason that the upper l‘lith‘l‘s lmvc bccn sci-
ting,r tllc pace in past ycars i'or sloppy stunts
at S. l.'. 'l’. it has usually bccn an undcrclass
stunt that captured thc prizc and prcscntcd a
little cntcriniilmcui, i'or tlic quccu.

“'c rcpcnt for thc nib iimc tilc Inlscs oi’ judg-
merit in the stunt competition which judges
invariably Use and people complain about,
afterward. "There must be evidences oi’ pi't'])ll~
ration, good general class participation, cntcr-
tainincnt value, nndepcrhaps most liill)oi'lilill"~
smoothness or ﬁnish in the iiual production."

If the judging oi’ next week’s competition
turns out to be just a toss-up among three or
four poor productions, we’re going to suggest
a simpler form of intcrclass rivalry such as a
“Knock, knock” contest.

Boake Carter Interviews the Average Man
“ Johnny Q. Public ” Speaks, by Boake Carter. Dodge
Publishing Company, New York, 1936. 278 pages.
$2.00.
(On sale (11 the C'o-op)

Radio listeners of the last six years could guess by
his voice that news commentator Boake Carter was a
‘ambridgc man.

Since Cambridge he has been in the service of the
Royal Air force, of the London Daily Mail, oi.’ the oil
business in Mexico. In the United States his activities
have centered around Philadelphia where he writes for
the papers and comluets nightly news broadcasts for
l’hilco.

Carter’s six years in radio have netted him from one
to one and a half million letters from listeners, coin-
nicuting on his broadcasts. From these be conceived
“Johnny Q. Public " Speaks. Fl'Uili representative
letters he traces the reactions of the ordinary man to
the New Deal.

Carter writes as he talks—clearly and to the point.
Claiming no ich to grind, he records his observations
t'nirly, blending them only slightly with his own coli-
scrvntivc background. Carter is the conservative Ameri-
can as he should bc.

Charlie Taft, Middle-of—the-Roader

You and I—And Roosevelt, by Charles l’helps Taft.
lt‘nrrnr, New York, 1936. 111 pages. $1.00.

Charlie Taft is a linudon brain-truster, but no acute
partisan. He was deemed too tolerant in his views to
attend an anti-New Deal meeting lust winter. Said
Taft: "They wanted someone who would damn F. l).
R. and all his works. i can’t and won't, and some
of the Republication orntors and candidates who do,
give me an acute pain iii the neck.”

Says Time:

“Charlie ’l‘ui't is proud to cull himself a middle-of-
thc-rondcr, n inoderntc, u mugwuinp. The thesis of
You and I—And Roosevelt is that to win the 1936
campaign, Republicans must appeal to other moderates
who like progress but not too much of it, and that

much not too fast. Those moderates, he warns, are
in sympathy with most of the New Deal aims. He
himself likes its tul'iil' policies, its securities and

stock regulation, its bank deposit insurance, its hand-
lingr of strikes and championship of Lnbm'. tie up-
proves of public works, regulation of public utilities
(including government "yurdsticks"), easy farm nml
home credit, and n more equitable distribution of the
nation's wealth. Strong for social security. he coli-
sidcrs the New Dcnl's system unjust and ilupructiblc,

dislikes its "spcudtlu'ii‘t generosity", its currency
policies. liut the only things which l‘cully make him

boil are: (l) ” must ” bills, jummcd through without
adequate debate by ('ougl'css or the nation; (:3) waste
and politics in relief; til) the spoils system as pl'uc-

ticcd by James A. ll‘ul'lcy."

Hair Story Will Amuse
Absentee: at Banquet

Chief among the horse-play
and humorous incidents at the
twentieth anniversary banquet of
the News is the hairy story which
bears repetition for students not

present.
The seventy-ﬁve members from
past and present boards and

stnii's found :1 special sense of
humo' among the less hairy gucsts

present.

thn called upon to make a
few comments, Mr. Clarence A.
ll'idley, assistant professor of

history, wondered about the kiwi
of hair tonic which was so vou-
ducive to growth on the top of
the head of Hamilton Acheson,
’30. Mr. Acheson attributed
the successful crop of seven
scattered hairs to the hair rc-
storer prescribed by Dr. William
M. French, instructor in educa-
tion and editor-in-chict' of the
NEWS in 1929. Dr. French, not
to be outdone by the two men
with shining heads, revealed that
all of his success was due to Mr.
llidlcy, who had taught him all
he knew about keeping hair on
his hcnd.
