Us men aren’t to be outdone. The
M.A.A. will conduct its ﬁrst annual
Washington Park hike and hot dog
roast during the coming Christmas
vacation. It might be January 1,
and then again, it might not. Any-
way, doughty trampers are urged to
sign up on the main bulletin board.
Don’t pack a lunch, but half a
rock, since a common snack will
be provided for that trivial fee.
Buses will leave the rear entrance
at 3:00 am. sharp. Think of the
bus driver and come on time.

The touch football game which
occurred on the Alumni l‘li'sldi'nce
field 'l'uesday last was one, hum-
diliger of ii tussle. Each team

featured ii passing attack, that of
the other team. liei'cree, head lines-
iiiaii and umpire i)’llora saw to it
that no dirty work went on when
he wasn‘t attempting to peer in the
rear windows of the dorniilory
Everyone had a good time and was
glad he came.

Our Alma Mater has produced
more coaches than one would opixie.
Back last week-end were none other
than coaches Jadick, Ungerer, Al-
brecht, DiGioia, Baker, and Welter,
sports tutors all in secondary insti-
tutions throughout the state. We
hope they have winning teams.

There has drifted to us a little
moralizing raconte, which we con-
sider pertinent. Here ’tis:

Long ago, there dwelt in a little
cottage on the. outskirts of ii small
town. an aspiring yontli, whom we
christen Cuthbert. t'uthbert
was a carefree. irresponsible, sort of
fellow, and one wont frequently to
gambol on the adjacent gladc. tlur
Cuthbert bad a veritable iiniiiia for
touch football. and iii the spring
of the year took no mean pleasure
in whacking a baseball over the big
elm tree in the far end of the field.

Cuthbert grew up, as boys will.
He even came to be addressed as
Cuthbert the Gouger, which made
him feel nicer than he would admit.
High school days ﬂoated by for
Cuthy, and the sun of favor shone
brightly on our boy’s smiling face.

He was a strapping lad of seven—
teen when he learned llnit he lind

Off to college he trooped and went
extra-class in a big way. At the
close of his sophomore year, he
psychoanalysed himself. He found
that he had a lot on the hall, all
right. But one epoclial eve, as he
drew himself to his full height on
a drug store scales. he look noic ol
a fifteen pound loss since his fresh
man days. And the honor in his
room showed a iliibby creatnie, not

the siroct-riinning, bicycle-pumping
Cuthbert we met earlier in the story.

Three New Systems on Trial

In Drive for Payment
0f Class Dues

Upper elnssnieii of State college
have unanimously welcomed the nu-
nounecinents of Helen McGowan,
’37, Janet Dibble, ’38, and Richard
lionsdale, ’39, concerning the doom

 

 

of “padded” class budgets and
lowered class dues.
The senior class has entrusted

their experiment in class finance to
tiventyuflve appointed captains re.
sponsihle to a committee composed of
Miss McGowan, treasurer, and Rob-
ei‘t Margison, president. Each cap-
tain has been assigned approximately
twelve seniors whose duty it is to

see to the collection of each mem-
ber’s dues. ’l’bo dues are now two
dollars and installment payments

will be accepted.

The junior class, represented by
eight captains, will "close its initial
drive for payment of class dues t0~
day. Last May, the class agreed to
reduce the class dues to one dollar
and a half, provided that enough of
the class members would sign pledges.

The sophomore class has decided
to postpone decision on the passing
of its budget. The class ofﬁcers
have agreed to lower the dues from
$2.00 to $1.50 provided three-fourths
of the class will sign pledges agree-
ing to pay their dues before Decem-
ber 1. 'l‘weniy captains have been
appointed to carry on the drive. If
it is successful, Richard Lonsdale,
treasurer, will present the revised
budget to the class soon.
