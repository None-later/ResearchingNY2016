Economics And The National
Political Campaign
There are a number of popular explanatlons
of how people are going to vote November 3.
WPA workers, for instance, are conceded t0

Roosevelt. Regular Republicans will vote for
Landon, regular Democrats for Roosevelt.

Conservatives are presumably with the Re-
publicans, liberals with the Democrats.

The exact truth of these presumptions we
neither afﬁrm, deny, nor attempt to quality.
With the first two we attempt no comment.
for the one about liberals and conservatives
we have this to say—that with those voters
informed on economic attairs, the economics
of the New Deal seem the vital issue in the
campaign.

Said Governor Landon: “ la the early days
of our Republic most of the laws regulating
business were enacted by the States. As the
years went by, conditions became more com-
plex and gradually the Federal government

became active in protecting the economic
freedom and welfare of our citizens. As
a result we have our laws on pure l'oods,

public health, banking, lransportation. work-
mcn’s compensation, sat’cty appliances, mo-
nopolics and unfair trade practices, aml morc
rcccntly our laws regulating public utilities
and the issuance of sccurilics.”

(lovcrnor Landon states that this is an
“imposing list ” of laws for our cconomic wcl-
l'arc. “ It has marked America as a progrcs-
sivc nation." liul the New Deal cconomic
Incasurcs, the Republican camlidatc maintains,
arc a dill'crcnl kind of lcgislation. 'l‘hcy tend
to give lhc Federal governmcnl much
power, and smack of a socialislic philosophy
that is wholly un-Amcrican. 'l‘ln-rcl'orc to
licpulilicans the New lical incasurcs havc bo-
eomc cxpcrimcnlation ol’ a rnlhcr dangcrous
kind. New Deal cxpcndilul'cs have bccomc waslc,
Willi lhc ligurc ol' lhc politician lt‘arlcy loom-
in;r in the background.

'l‘o l’rcsidcnl Rooscvcll, on tho olhcr hand.
thc administration policics havc bccn an cX—
tension ol' the imposing list of cconomic logis-
lalion to mch lhc Moods of today. licl who
will call, it. socialism. 'l‘hc cxpcmliturcs ol'
tln- last three years have bcconlc to thc admin-
istration an invcslnn-nl in .\mcrica's l'ulurc.

’l‘bal ltooscvcll gcls instruction from Mos-
cow is absurd; that he could innh’c lhc l'nilcd
Stall-s into a socialislic slatc won it hc wuulcd
to is bcing' blind lo practical .\incrican poli~
tics. 'l'hal Landon is u schcining rcactionary
is likewisc absurd; and that ho could t‘lit‘t'h’
cnlircly lhc incrcasc in govcrmucnt rcgulalion
lil' cconomic nll'airs is lo ovcrloolv' thc incrcas-
im.r compchin of our civilization.

The campaign will probably be largcly dc-
cidcd on partisan grounds as usual. lint wc
ullcr the pious hopc that thosc votcrs who
arc l'rcc cnough l’rom party tics, and who will
carry ccrlain doublt'ul statcs, will dccidc thc
eh-ction on the basis of economic issncs.

How To Handshake

And then there was the freshman girl who went; up
to the French professor after upper classmen had told
her the only way you can get good marks in college is by
handshaking.

Beamed the fresh: “You know, professor, you are
the most wonderful French professor I have even seen! ”
The professor beamed.

Now the girl made just one mistake as we see it.
She should have said it in French.

-)l- * i 9(-

llandshaking probably started with our Anglo-Saxon
hero licoyvult', who had the grip of thirty men. To
equal the epic record, State college students have
resorted to special exercises in the use of the grip.
Last spring there were the “handles,” and we may
live to see the student: association installing one of
those penny arcade “test your grip” things in the
(.‘ommons.

In addition to physical exercises, some students have
taken up scholarly research to better their hand-
shaking vocabulary. The dictionary has made excellent
reading in this line, although as Professor York says,
it is “a little bit disconnected.”

All seriousness aside, we think handslmking is the
way to put yourself through college. At least 99
per cent of the people who have gotten anywhere
nrouml State college have been handshakcrs. The
reason for this is that nobody can ever lcll when he
is being llnlldsliook. [’rot'cssors or bigshot students
wouldn’t drcam you had cornered them to talk about
nothing just as a part of your policy of applcpolishing.
They never can read true character.

it it 1* it

People will tell you that handshakch go a long
way, and will give examples. And there have. been
examples. Even so, we would rather believe that the
people who have the most fun are not the hoodwinkcrs
and the lwo-t'accd, but people who arc sinccrc in the
bromlcning ot' lhcir list of l'ricuds, including faculty.

Yes, we know the aiiswcr to that one. l‘lvcrybody,
cvcn a “fricnd” ot' a faculty member, is still a haml-
shakcr. 'l'hc pcoplc who make this claim, however,
are usually those who have neglected to make the
:n-quainlnncc ot‘ their major and minor olh'ccrs and
arc a little bit jealous. Rut for the sake of argument
we will givc in lo the claim, agree that everybody who
looks at a faculty member is a handsbuker, and pro-
cccd to point out that there are two types ol’ them.

'l‘hcrc are lhc clevcr hamlshakcrs and the obvious
oncs. The obvious ones, who speak to lhc t'ncully
bccnusc they have to, and who speak about nothing at
all, arc public nuisances in our humblc cslinmtion. For
t'ricndship any day is hotter than dcccil.

PLAYUOEK —

 

The lights dimmed, the curtains
parted, and once more State’s dra-
matics season opened. An eager and
critical audience surpassing that of
many years awaited the protcgcs.

Miss l’ricc’s play got the evening
oll' to a laughing start when Janice
Niel-man made her over-dressed en-
trance. Despite her forgotten accent
and character at several points, we
think she does have possibilities and
hope to see more of her character
roles.

After the first play of the evening
the Advanccd Dramatics class should
rcalizo the great importance in a
well-directed play at unity and
lcmpo, both of which were dclinitcly
lackng ill this play. Probably mis-
casling was largely responsible for
both. The male roles \vcrc dccidcdly
wcuk, but taking into considcratiou
lhc most ol’ the
actors. \vc morc ot'
thcir work.

l‘iclly .\ppcldoorn gave us a wcll-
dircctcd pcrl'ormancc. Hcr set and
props were u grcul improvement ovcr

incxpcl'icncc ol’
look forward to

lhosc ol’ lhc ﬁrst play. 'l'hc rc-
inarkahlc lighting addcd immcnscly

lo the tcnsc drama of the play.

'l'om Kcllcy gave his usual sus-
laincd [n-rt‘ormancc and hold thc
andicncc us he has in the past. His

charm'lcrimtion ncvcr lapscd: In-
carricd the rcsl ot' the cast along,’ to

a successful cud. We likcd lx'cn

'l‘hc movcmcnt in Miss .\ppcl
