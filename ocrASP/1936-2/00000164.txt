 Events Have Made" Up

Campus Days in Past Years

On October 23, 1920, State college
had “a real get-together on the
college campus for a (lag of sport”
under the direction of the Physical
Education club. Included in the
events were a cross-country run for
men, obstacle races, tug-o’-war,
potato races, and a basketball game.
At night there was a sing followed
by dancing, with music furnished by
the Milne High orchestra. This was
the first annual Campus day.

The ﬁrst campus queen was
crowned in 1922, when other fea-
tures included somersault racing and
a bizarre relay of Eskimo-Milking
and elephant-tanning. This first
queen, a member of Myskania, as all
but three of her successors have
been, was attended by five girls in
long white robes with Greek head-
dresses of their class eulnl's. and
was crowned with a coronet of an-
tumn leaves. Stunts were given for
the first time this year, too.

In 1923, the scheme of things re-
volved around a circus in the gym-
nasium. All the class stunts were
molded along these lines, each heng
an act in the circus. Clowns filled
in the gaps.

In l924, the highlight of the day

was a football game with Colgate
freslunen. State scored a moral vic-
tory only, according to the ‘ans,’
the score being 33—0 in favor of
Colgate.

Campus day has many
changes since Myskania took it un-
der its wing in 192]. The years
1928—30 \vere so well-attemlcd that
it became necessary to issue tickets
for admittance.

Last year, in accordance with an
amendment to the constitution,
('amfms day was transferred to the
control of student council who will
superriae it this year.
