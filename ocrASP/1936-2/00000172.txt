C. N. M.

It's a high flung standard of ﬁrst
'half play this year's basketball
team must live up to. The 1935—
1938 mesh machine had plenty of
:stuff, for the ﬁrst twenty minutes
of play, but sometimes faded at the
halfway mark. After the first half
of play in the Niagara game, you
will remember that we headed the
Roaring Cataracts, 24-14. An in-
spired Niagara team and removals
on personal fouls of three of our
starting ﬁve combined to produce a
disastrous second half for the In-
.structors.

Again in the Lowell Textile garlic,
a. last minute slump made the score
look far more one-sided than the
game really was. l’oint: ll hetter
buliineed squad. which means strong
reserves, is needed. We hold. hash-
fully enough ’tis true. that new
purple and gold will have n more
potent supporting east.

Tournaments are moving along,
intramurally speaking. Will Fra-
ment, freshman netman, seems to
hold the whip hand so far in the
racquet tourney. Quoit hurling is
ﬁnding its followers in the back yard,
with first round play already at an
end. For the most part, though,
prospective contests of the past
two weeks have been called off be-
cause of wet grounds or non-support.
This picayune cooperation on the
part of the men is as self-devastat-
ing as suicide.

Wilczynski Leads Team
In Delhi Victory

 

The State College
wott‘ pack trampled the Delhi Aggie

cross-country

barriers into the muck and mire ot’
the latter’s hilly course Saturday,
October 24, in a hotly contested
run. Anthony Wilezynski, sopho-
more speedster, led the team to a
26—29 victory, covering the 2.8 mile
route in 18:43.

The stamhni-paeked frames of the
distance men were taxed to the
utmost because ot’ the sloppy eon-
ditioii ot’ the course. The Aggie
athletes trudged along tolerably well,
but they weren’t able to ﬁnish live
men so near the treat as were the
'l‘enehers~- and that means defeat in
erossreountry. Haynes, Htute junior,
might have tinished stronger lltltl he
not t'alleu liadly, a victim of the
treaeherous t’ooting.

(liin forty-six seconds separated
the winner and the tenth man to
ﬁnish. ’l'liis means that in this, a
dual meet, on runner more than
these l'orty-siw seeonds, or about two
hundred lit-hind the winner
tallied for his learn.

For Court Til“

Barrington to Select
Freshman Team

 

 

Freshmen basketball a s p i r a n ts
have settled down to daily practice
in preparation for their ﬁrst tilt, a
game with Milne High school, No-
vember 20.

Sixteen men are to he kept at prac-
tice for two weeks, at which time
four will be dropped to leave a work-
ing squad of twelve.

Coach Thomas Bnrrington, ’37,
will pick the ﬁnal group from Sini-
mons, Fairhaiik, ls‘rament, Kelly,

l‘layser, 'l‘uttlc, Relyea, De Neet’, Van

Keuren, Leggett, Cherro, Greenwauld,

Phililis, Ilnser, Quinn and Balog.
Although a definite schedule has

not been announced, the R. P. I.

freshmen, Mont Pleasant, Lansing-

liurgh and Amsterdam teams will
see action on the Page llall court.
l“lll’tllt‘l' contacts will probably place

)ohoes, t‘. it. A., Albany Academy,

Watervliet, Renssnlaer on the list.
Practice sessions have uncovered

material which equals the usual

standard in freshman volunteers. A

hard driving, fast moving quintet

should- result from the exacting out-
line which they are following.

This year’s schedule will bring
strong opposition to the best that
we can oll'er. R. l’. 1., Mont
Pleasant and (‘oliot-s, always strong,
will he three ot’ the biggest obstacles.
.\ win over any one ot’ these teams
will demand nothing short ot’ per-
t'eet‘ion lll teamwork.
