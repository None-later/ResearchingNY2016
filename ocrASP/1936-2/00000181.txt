As pigskins are booted around all
about us, we long just a little for
the fanfare and publicity that goes
with college football. Six years ago,
the name of Notre Dame was on the
lips of every lover of sport; now it's
Minnesota—and they are as much
talked of in defeat as in victory.
0h, swish, you may reiterate scorn-
fully. And rightfully so. For we
wouldn’t be the Fort Orange scourge
or the Purple menace, not right off
the bat, anyway. We might get to

 

 

play R.P.I. or Union sometime,
though.

As we see it, there are involved
in the question “Football or no toot-
ball?" three gradients: man-power,
money, and amount of time for
practice. State has none of these at
this point. The third essential could
no doubt be secured after no little
wheedling. Our humble hazard is
that the first two factors would have
to develop out of nothing and school
spirit. We do think, though, that
the die should be cast, the Rubicon
crossed, the thing given a ﬂing.

Saturday, October 31, the State
college cross-country team chalked
up another victory to keep its season ’s
record free of defeats. The corn
and callous lads defeated Bard 23—33
at Aminndale.

Harold Haynes, ’38, ﬁnished ﬁrst
and shuttered the record for the
4t. 1 mile course, which liiid stood since
till-l2. He came ln'eeziiig through in
the fast time of 23:42, lowering the
previous mark by twelve seconds.
\\’itc7.ynski, too, winner ot’ the Delhi
meet, was better than tllly Bard
runner. The team as it whole trotted
a line group race, perhaps the best
that a State cross-country team has
ever l'llll.

’l‘he finishing order at Bard was:
lliiyiies, State, lirst: Wilczyuski,
State, second; liesti, l‘ltll‘tl, third;
lleynolds, State, fourth; Kerly, llard,
lil'th; l‘eiihody, llni'd, sixth: De
liiisso, Htiite, seventh; Jordy, liitrd,
eighth; .lohusoii, State, ninth; and
liiehuniii, llai'd, tenth.

()n November l4, the DlllllOll boys
meet the ('ohleskill \ggies. \\'ith the
experience iilreiuly gained in their
other two tiissles, tropes for an tin-
defeated season look exceedingly
bright.

.-\uspieious in the extreme is the
outlook for next season’s hiiri'iers.
l‘lxcepl for the addition ot’ whatever
distance men the class ot' lit-ll can
produee, the same stpind that has
legged it so successfully this season
will take the lleld a year from now.
’l‘eaui improvement this year should
lead to meets with hill lllltl diile ug-
gregalious ol' the calibre of li.l’.l.,
