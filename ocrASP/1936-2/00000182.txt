State Political Poll
Favors Roosevelt
(Continued from page 1, column 1)

All of the Communist votes were
from urban arens.

Hoover Wins by 2—1 in 1932

In the 1932 straw vote held at
State college, Hoover polled a total
of 437 votes, Roosevelt 242, Norman
Thomas, the Socialist candidate, 68;
and Al Smith, Eddie Cantor, James
“Sehnozzle” Durante, and Emma
Goldman, each received one vote.

The poll for the gubernatorial
election in 1932 was close with
Lieutenant-Governor Lehman receiv<
tag 375, Donovan 340, and the
Socialist candidate 19 votes. This
would indicate a split in the Repub-
lican ranks.

0n the prohibition question, college
students in 1932 showed themselves
as deﬁnitely wanting to do something
about the situation, for 229 voted
for modiﬁcation of the eighteenth
amendment, 227 for repeal, whereas
only 171 voted for enforcement, and
119 for a referendum on the ques-
tion.

Thirty-nine institutions of higher

We all agree on this . . . cigarette
paper is important. For Chesterﬁeld
we use the best paper that we can
buy. It is called Champagne Ciga-
rette Paper. It is made from the soft,
silky ﬁbre of the ﬂax plant. It is

washed over and over in clear, spark-

ling water.

A lot of the pleasure you get in
smoking Chesterﬁelds is due to our
using the right kind of cigarette pa-
per. Chesterﬁcld paper is pure, and
it burns without taste or odor.

 

 

 

STATE COLLEGE NEWS, NOVEMBER 6, 1936

small and large, in all parts of the
country were included in this ,tnbu-
lotion. The results show that Frank-
lin D. Roosevelt carried 22 schools to
Governor Alfred M. London’s 16.

In its relation to the actual elec-
tion, college straw-balloting should
not be regarded too seriously, since
many of the voters are not of legal
voting age.

In the 36 schools that presented
their ballot totals, Roosevelt amassed
12,284 votes, while Governor Lan-
don garnered 10,769.

The following were some of those
voting for Governor Landon: Prince-
ton university, Amherst college; Le-
high university, Springﬁeld college,
Gettysburg college, Rutgers uni-
versity, Bryn Mawr, Connecticut
college.

The new third party did not
threaten the two leaders at all.
Norman Thomas, Socialist candidate,
was runner-up to Landon with 542
votes. The others of the “big ﬁve,”
Ilrowder and Lemke, trailed with
349 and 268 respectively.

included in those voting for Roose-
velt are: New York university,
Creighton university, University of
Kentucky, Northwestern university,
Louisiana State university, Univerc
city of Richmond, University of New
Mexico, Rider college, Ohio State
university, University of Wisconsin.

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 

 

 

 

Hellenics

 

 

 

Calmness reigned last weekend in
striking contrast to what will happen
this weekend. Hop, house dances.

The Eta Phi girls had as guests
Kay Stuart Stradling, ’35, and Carol
Hill, ’36. Jean Watkins and Francis
Leivhn, ’36, made merry at Psi (lam.
Dorothy Hedges, ’36, who is at pres-
ent teaching at Edgcwmd Park,
Brinrclit‘t‘ Manor, weekended at Chi
Sig.

And still the pledges come. At
E B Phi, Betty Gordon], ’39, has
taken the pledge vows. Ann Sarcone,
’38, and Rita Benedict, ’39, are
wearing Gamma Phi Sig pledge pins.

Sigma Alpha takes pleasure in an-
nouncing Miss Vivian Gummo, of the
Mathematics department, as a new
honorary member.

'l‘hat’s all. . . . Dance through the
weekend and have a grand old time.

Freshman Class Revotes
The freshman class completed the
election of its officers at a meet.ng
Tuesday, October 27. As a result of
the ﬁnal revotes, James Quinn will be
men’s cheerleader; Virginia Mitchell,
manager of girls’ athletics: and

Yolanda Richardson, class reporter.

 

Remember this . . . two things make the
smoking quality of a cigarette— Ihc tobaccos and the
paper. The Champagne cigarette paper on Chester»
ﬁelds is tested over and over for purity, for the right
burning quality. Another reason why Chesterﬁeld wins.
