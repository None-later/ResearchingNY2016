Open Letter Asks
More ‘Big’ Bands

Seniors Acclaim Hop Success,
Urge Noted Orchestras
At Other Dances

 

'I‘he possihility of having hig
"nume' hands at State college
l'ormuls \\as pointed out ill an open
letter to the News from the ollieers
ot' the senior class. The Senior llop
was a social and linaneial success, the
letter stated, and indicates that; larger
and more prominent hands at. State’s
l'ormals would improve attendance
and also make the students more
interested in their dances.

The open letter reads as follows:
To the l-Zditor, H’rtvria (‘omrtoe News:
llop l"riday night
proved a point that has heen argued
ever since «State college had its lirst.
l'ormal dance. 'l‘he point under coil-
tentiou was that if dance committees
were willing to invest money in an
expensive “name” haml and a still-
location, the students ot' the
college would support the class spou-
soring the dance.

The senior class dance committees
overrun their hudget by one humlred
and twenty-live dollars in order to
secure an excellent orchestra and all
attractive settingr for the dance.
.\'ow, however, they can point with
the largest attendance a
Henior [top has ever had, at least as
far hack as records show. The result
is a prolit to the class of approxi-
mately thirty dollars.

The presence of a nationally known
orchestra at a State college dance
was a departure from the ordinary,
hat the system under which the dance

was coiulueted was also an innova«
tion. if it had heen run true to

tation on the legitimate stage. De-
termined to study under the best man

hccoming a pupil of llelasco.

Hhe displayed magnificent persist-
ence in her cll'orts to have “Lysls-
truta.” produced. After seven years

themselves over and over again. More
power to them! llut I shouldn’t en-
joy doing that.”

farge in “'l‘hc Tale of Two Cities”

“Romeo and Juliet”. The outburst;
of ’l‘hcrese Dcfargc, the revenget‘ul
peasant, i'as acclaimed the greatest:
ovation ever given on a set.

Miss Yurka says of her lirst ex-
perienco in the moving-picture world,
“The role in my lirst picture was one
of the most interesting in my career.
Interesting because of the terriﬁc
deliln-ratiou, the deadly calm of the
wonmn up to the moment the storm
hreaks. ’ ’

la the past few months Miss Yurka
has heeu making amiearanees in many
colleges throughout the country.
