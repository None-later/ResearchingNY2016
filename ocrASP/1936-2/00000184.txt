Death Is So Permanent

Our Armistice llny thoughts are a little bit
wistful.

The. world is spending nine billion dollars on
tirins this your. The littited States. most securely
plueed of ill! tlte notions. is letting: its war inni-
gets go up to n peace-time record: 1934. $479.-

193‘. $996,000,000.

notion tintt .‘l state \\‘llivlt men hnye ereated is
more important tlmn those who created it. is
outing at the eonnnon sense of tnany peoples.

.\nd yet tlte picture is a little brighter tltatt
ilinl.

ltt .1757 New Yorkers were dumping- boatloads
of New Jersey oysters into the lludson by hijack-
ing methods to prevent their entry into eity
nuirkets. Two years later the l-‘ederal t'onsti-
tution went into etl‘eet and the various states
agreed to let u eentrul government settle some of
their eeonontie ditlieulties.

Students of the world war. including some of .

those who. failed to stop it in 1914. tell its that
“or is not inevitable unless you think it so. And

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

they tell us that n little eooperation goes a long ‘

way.

These hopeful things would lend
that enlightenml dipiomnoy and edut-a ion nzay
hand in hand some to wipe on: the tours and
inisappi‘ehensions or" a thousand years. and lead
