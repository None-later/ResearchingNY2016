Coach Hatﬁeld's gas house gang
treks mildly north December 5 to
engage the Engineers of Rensselaer
Polytechnic institute in a court con-
test. Here’s a little light on how
the court caperers from the collar
and end city stack up.

Coach Ed Donald of the technical
school has named Tuesday, Novem-
ber 17, as the (late of opening prac—
tice. Back from last year's squad are.
six veterans, including Captain Levo-
nian and Gilcoync, former ’l‘roy High
School players who held down start-
ing berths during the 1935-1936 sea-
son.

The four lettermen who will report
are Fellows, Ward, Silvera, and Saf-
ford. No novices they, either. Bank-
ed with reserves gathered from the
team that represented the class of
1939 a year ago, the team presents
a powerful unit for the Teachers to
cope with initially.

Here we go predicting with the

game a whole week away. It’s the
Frosh—Milne High game we mean,and
we pick the Frosh. Our selection
may be construed as a patriotic one
or as one arrived at only after care-
ful observation of and comparison
between two squads. What we have
done is adjudged that the speed ad-
vantage of the embryo net nudgers
will outweigh their height handicap
—by ten points, too.

Here's an interest ing fact: the
freshman team can't be called the
yellow and nhitc this year even
though their cla~~ colors are just

that. 'l‘ln-y will wear purple and gold
uniforms with an indication soine~
where on the suit that they repre-
sent. not the college. but the l'rcslr
mau class taken part of the
college.

Drifted this way, piled up at the
column door, as it were, are argu-
ments used in discussing whether an
orchestra or the victrola should be
used for dancing after basketball
games. Now, the MAA, or men’s ath—
letic group, has always supplied, and
would have to supply this year what-
ever pittance goes to the orchestra
for their offerings.

But they are willing to go social
and satisfy demand within their
means. Undoubtedly, at one or two
games, an orchestra wtll niusicale.
It has been subtly hinted, though,
that a victrola, being what is Is, needs
no intermission nor rest period. And
yet who can blame a band for not
playing steadily for two hours for
pin money—which is all we have.

Runners Cancel
Coblglrill Meet

Classes Prevent Hill-Balers
From Attending Run
This Afternoon

’l‘he cross-country meet scheduled
for this afternoon between the State
barriers and the Cobleskill Aggics
has been cancelled. The contest was
originally hooked for this afternoon
on the Cobleskill course, but the
necessity of cutting classes to make
the trip made the meet an impossi-
bility for the State crew.

Manager Reynolds, attempting to
salvage some sort of get together
front the remnants, suggested alter-
native dates. llowevcr, since these
dates were not acceptable to the.
Aggies, it was no contest.

The 'l‘eachcr-harricrs have engaged

in two meets this year and have
come out on top in both. 0n Octo-
ber 24, they nosed out the Delhi

Aggics, with 'l‘ony Wilczynski, ’39,
leading the field home. A week later,
the squad wallopcil Bard by a still
more comfortable margin, with
llayncs, '38, and \\'ilczynski breast-
ing the tape in one-two order.

With no member of the squad due
to graduate and one successful Ht'll-
son behind them, line things in the
form of an equally successful season
with broader scheduling arc to be
looked for from next year’s team.

Final Vanity Line-rip

The varsity basketball squad
has been cut from approximately
twenty to a more easily work-
nblo group of thirteen. Sur-
vivors of the slash will continue
the daily practice sessions which
have been going on for two
weeks now on the Page hull
court under the direction of
Coach (l. Elliot llatticld.

The system of play Coach
Hatfield is engendering in the
squad emphasizes first of all
possession of the hall and then
a speedy attack. It demands
stamina and aggressiveness, and
more particularly, smooth pass
ing.

The squad as it now stands:
Richard Margison, J. Ryan,
Bancroft, Erwin, Harrington,
llyrncs, George Amyot, Morris,
lilurd, I-lershkowitz, Lehman,
T. Ryan, and Walko.
