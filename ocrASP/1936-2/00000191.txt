.As a sequel to the “cupid-eon-
'ieious” story of two weeks ago, the
NEWS inquisitor now reveals the re-
dults of his extensive research on
‘_‘ﬂrst dates.” The numerous and
varied answers given to the question,
"What do you remember about your
ﬁrst date at State college?” indicates
that there is no hardship in the ﬁeld
of “dating.” Almost all the stu-
dents questioned had had their ﬁrst
date very early in college life and
had followed this one with a suf-
ﬁcient number of others to make any
early recollection very vague.
Clem \Voltt’, ’39, best expressed
this state of affairs when he care-
lessly said, “I didn’t know what to

do then, but. how I’ve learnedl”
Flossie Nelbaeh, ’38, wouldn’t
even try to recall her ﬁrst date.

“I’m too thrilled with my last one
to think back any further,” quoth
she.

not so enthusiastic about his ﬁrst
evening with a “State” girl. “It
had the kick of a man without any
legs,” bemoaned he.

Up in the library we found Ken
Doran, ’39, who proudly acclaimed,
“She fell down stairs to meet me,”
while Dot Cain, ’39, quoted the old

proverb, “ Anticipation was better
than realization.”
Jane Wilson, ’40, very adroitly

confessed that she “looked forward
to another mail.”

When Johnny Ryan, ’37, was ap-
proached, he contemplated that he
could “say something that would
burn some people up very easily,”
but his remarks llnally subtle(d)
down to the statement, “A fresh-
man date, a trip to Nassau, and a
little ‘Ade,’ but no ‘I-lall.’ ”
