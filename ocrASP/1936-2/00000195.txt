Senator’s College

T THE age of 75 most men have come to the sun
. set of their lives and desire rest most of all. Public
ﬁgures, at that age, write autobiographies and daudlc
over the past. On july H, 1936, Senator George
William Norris was 75 and could look back on 34
years of service in Washington. Instead he looked
forward to another six years as senator, a term that
will last until he is 81.

“l have battled, battled
for everything I got.“ So
he told an interviewer once
At 75 he was battling tWo
opponents in Nebraska, :1
regular Republican and .l
Democrat unrecognized by
President Roosevelt, who
has spoken endearineg
about Senator Norris. HP»

Senator Norris‘ college days were days of postponr
ment. Born in Ohio, he worked on {arms during lln’
summer. Student at Baldwin University in Ohio and
Northern Indiana Normal School, he taught school
during intervening years in order to continue school
I” I'm} he received a law degree from Valparaiso
University. but had to teach another year to get a

THE TEST DIVE!

Straight down from 4 miles up—motor
roaring—struts screaming—Gehlbach tears
earthward like a bullet ﬂashing from a re-
volver. At the bottom of the 2-mile drive
—a sharp pull-out wrenches plane and
pilot to the limit. Such tests make planes
safer. Anything can happen. A bump in the
air—a tiny ﬂow, and the plane can ﬂy
to pieces as though dynamited while the
pilot takes to his parachute. But, as you
can see at the right, Lee Gehlbach eats
heartily and enjoy: his food. Note the Camel
cigarette in his handwone of the many
Camels that Lee enjoys during and after
meals. In his own words (above). he gives
you the reason why Camels are his cigarette.

Loo Gohlhocll says: “Smoking Carnal”: hoops
my digestion tuned up and running smooth"

“ AMELS set me right!” Gehlbach says. " You know,

chance is only 10% of my business. Keeping alert

and in line condition is the other 90%. I smoke Camels

with my meals, and afterward, for digestion’s sake.

And when I say Camels don't get on my nerves, it
means a lot."

Good digestion and healthy nerves are important
for everyone in this wide-awake era. Camels at meal-
time and after speed up the ﬂow of digestive ﬂuids
—increose alkalinity—help bring a‘ sense of well-
being. So make Camel your cigarette— for digestion’s

‘ sake—for their refreshing "lift." Camels set you
\  right! And they do not get on your nerves.
