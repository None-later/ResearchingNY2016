F rosh Squad Faces Milne
In Season Opener Tonight

 

Page Hall Court To Be Scene of Traditional Basketball Game;
Barrington and Margison Are Coaches of Rival Teams

Coach Thomas Barrington’s ag’
gressive but inexperienced freshman
quintet will inaugurate its 1936-37
basketball campaign tonight when it
will clash with its traditional rival,
Milne High, on the' Page liall court.
The shifty i’reslnnan squad has good
men at every berth but they lack
the experience which so often decides
the. outcome ot' a game. To offset
this handicap, Harrington has been
putting his squad through strenuous
workouts during the past week in
order to put a fast-clicking and
effective quintet on the tloor tonight.

This year, llick .\largison’s pro-
tcgccs will he out to revenge last

Once upon a time, in a dreamy
hamlet, lived a little girl by name
of Anastasia, sister to poor Cuthy.
She lived on and on (and on) ac-
quiring wisdom and intelligence until
ﬁnally she was good enough to come
here as a freshman. Cnthbert was
a sophomore. Cuthbert Wanted to
be big and strong. Cnthbert went
out for sports. The ﬁrst swing he
swung at the ball made him so giddy
