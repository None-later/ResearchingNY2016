STATE COLLEGE NEWS, NOVEMBER 20, 1936

 

“Hitler Educational Experiment
Bears Watching, ” Says Sprague

“Hitler has given the youth some-
thing to do.” This was the conclu-
sive factor voiced by Dr. H. A.
Sprague, president of Moutclair
Teacher’s college, in his address to
the student body in last. week’s
assembly.

Dr. Sprague. ﬁrst told the assembly
that observation is an excellent op-
portunity to get; suggestions and
then related some of his experiences
abroad, emphasizing the new German
education system.

Commenting on the relations be-
tween Hitler and education in Ger-
many today, he said that, pedagogi-
cally speaking, we get a great. many
suggestions from the methodry em-
ployed there.

In the new German system, ac-
cording to Dr. Spraguc, \\’ednesda_\'s
are devoted to the Hitler party. No
assignments are given on that day
and the students receive special in‘

 

struction in principles of the party,
in the ﬁeld of health, and in health
practices which “are recreational
and ot' a. nature that might be
classed as patriotic.”

The new system provides for edu-
cation in a series of schools up to
about 19 years of age. These schools
are professional, semi-professional,
classical, and scientille in nature and
their curricula are startlingly similar
to those of our high schools, junior
colleges, and colleges.

Nationalist. Socialist schools have
been established also. Hitler, Dr.
Sprague maintained, is trying to or-
ganize a model Nazi school system
and in doing so has caused con-
siderable connncnt as to the future
status of the classical school.

In conclusion "Dr. Sprague stated
that, “whether or not llitler will
be successful no one knows”, but

the experiment. will be an interesting
one to observe.
