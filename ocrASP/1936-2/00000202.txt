There Goes the Whistle

State‘s major sport. liaslv'etball. assumes the
number one position in eollee-e life for the next
three months as the Purple and (lold ball ehasers
gallop over the l{.l’.l. eourt to the tune of the
referee's whistle. And the sehetlllle. Wlllt'll
could well be the envy of many a college. should
bring delight to the l'ollowers ol' the 'l‘eaehers.

Let ‘s start the season otl’ with the whole sehool
behind our most potent representatives in the
intercollegiate world. The assembly eheerino
this morning should be more than a few dis—

cordant sounds. and tomorrow night should
witness a whole line of buses on the route to
Troy.

Members of the varsity have been undergoing
daily routine for over a month now. and their
eliorts should be backed up by attendance dqu
ingr the season. (in the eve ol' the lirst bullle

Now that 'l‘hankso’iving vaeation is a

The Commentstater

 

 

 

\Ve heard this little fable in class the other day,
and couldn‘t help handing it on as an indiention ot'
the status of woman in those vague ages .B.(.'. How-
ever, we can't let you read without a bit of personal
eomment.

.\s handed to us, it contained a little statement at
the top of the page to the oll'oet that it; was a Sanskrit
tan illustrating the "Oriental attitude of how wonmn’s
merits were eliiolly physical and her defects eliiolly
moral." We have been interested in observing the
mutation of numerous State oolleginns, of both sexes.
to the composition. We discovered that a number
of strongvminded feminists immediately arose in arms
on discovering.r that no mention had been made of
Wonmn's (with a capital) intellectual merits.

Yet. gentlemen of our :ltfqlltlllltllllt‘t' have sinee re-
marked upon the exactness of the analysis. Woman,
they stated triumphantly. is etel'nully the some. From
this, the apt. eoIn-lusion might be drawn that. though
the status oi woman may have advanced tremeiulously.
the attitude of men (of State men. at least.) remains
wnehunged; thus llltlll is' still livin;," in the dark of Slit)
ll.('. .\s for the women. they lmve deelared that the
only eonstnut in the tale is its I‘elleetion ot' the ineon-
stunt-y of man.

Here's the tale:

" in the beginning when 'l‘w'ashtri eame to the even-
[ion of wonmu. he found that. he had exhausted his
materials in the making ol‘ man and that. no solid
elements left. in this dilemma. after profound
meditation. he did as I'ollows': He took the rotundin
ot‘ the moon. and the eurves ol' the ereepers. and the
i-linging' ot' the tendrils. and the trembling ot' the gross.
aiul the slenderness ol' the reed. and the bloqu of no
tlowers. and the lightness- of the leaves. uml the
timidin ol' the hate. and the vanity of the pezu-oek.
and the elustel‘iuo of rows of bees'. and the joyous
gaiely ol' the sunbeams‘. and the weeping oi' the
elouds. and the lieklenos-s ol' the winds. and the soil-
ness' of honey. and the eruelly ol' the tiger. and the
warlu glow ot‘ lire. and the enldnoss of snow. alnl the
ehalteriug ol' jays. and the eooinf; ol' the euekoo. and
the hypot-I'isy ol‘ the eruue. and the lidelily ol' the
and eoinpoundiug all these together. he

slightly large, crowding the action
and minimizing the eharaeters. The
