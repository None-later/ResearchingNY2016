Men To Participate
In Large Program

 

Intramural Athletics Include
Diversiﬁed Winter Sports

 

The Men’s Athletic association
plans an ambitious and far-reaching
program of intramural sports for the
coming winter season. As many
activities as the facilities and partici-
pants will permit will be scheduled
for the cold weather months.

Interclass basketball is already
under way, rounds of games having
been played on Wednesday and
Thursday nights of this week. The
other pro-Christmas vacation dates
for games are December 10 and
December 16. Unusually keen com-
petition is expected in the ﬁve-team
race for the coveted trophy.

A little later in the season. the foul
shooting contest will be conducted to
determine the owner of the best eye
for the hoop. Rivalry in this new
event promises to be spirited.

Another project which, although
still in its embryonic stage, is receiv-
ing the attention of M..»\.A. and
Coach Hatﬁeld is the securing of a
swimming pool. Attempts are being
made to secure a pool that a larger
number of persons can use. If suc-
cessful, instruction will be given in
swimming and life saving and the

 

season will culminate in an inter-
class swimming meet.

Also, under the direction of Ed
llulihau, ’37, boxing has been
inaugurated. 'l‘he boxing class, held
each Thursday afternoon, has at-
tracted the attention of a few
would~be boxers and the manly art
of sclt’ defense seems to be on the
up grade.

Bowling, too, will be part of the
program, with meetings held once a
week for those who are interested.

Following the. precedent of the last
two years a ping pong tournament
will be held to decide who is master
of the art of table tennis. Along
with this will be run a paddle tennis
tournament. This game although
inaugurated only a few weeks ago has
proved enormously popular and with
some of our husky young amazons
playing, the sponge ball should take
quite a beating.

Intro-mural contests will also be
run in volleyball and any other sport
for which there is a demand. With
the enlarged program. a successful
winter season seems a certainty.
