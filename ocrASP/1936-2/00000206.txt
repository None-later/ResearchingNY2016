State College Acquires
A Modern Magazine

In the midst of the usual round of fault
ﬁnding and general disapproval in rcgard to
public affairs, it is a relief to find sorrrcthing
that a public can acclaim without reservation.
The publication of the new State College Echo
is one of these highly satisfactory events which
will be forgotten all too soon in the turmoil of
dissatisfaction in our extra-curricular halls, for
it is always easier to criticize than to praise.

The new Echo is a nrodcrn lite. 'ary irrag‘azinc,
a product of modern editorial art. Makeup and
typographical art have done most of the trans-
formation; the marginal quotations and the
general cxcellcncc of the material have cour-
plctcd it. The News cornrrrends the publication
cspccially on its cover design—thr- Ec/ro key,
copied some years ago from the NICWS award.

'l‘hc cheering in last Friday's assr-mbly and
at the li.l’.l. gamc, in spitr- of our liltlc cdilorial
warning, rcmirrdcd us of an ultcmll' r-ccital ol'
the alphabet. without animation or- pop. 'l‘ho
’l‘cachcrs bccarrrc suddcnly shy and rcl'uscd to
talk. The only reason wc can tind for this
phcnorrrcnrr is that cVor-yorrr- l\ afraid to clrccr
for four he may be heard abovo his l'cllows.
And good chccrirri,r is not. made that way.

The loss of this i'car. plus a study of collcgc
chm-rs and clrr-oring tcclrnirprc on tho part of
tho cheerleaders, will mnkr- tor a rorror’ulion of
State’s vocal assistance to its Icarus. t‘ollogc
cheers should be i'or5cl'ul and may to loarn, and
those in charge of them at Statr- should rrrrrko
use of" that fact.

The next time We chccr, lct's ycll. It may
Irot sound pretty, but it will sound pretty swr-ll,
for one looks more foolish whispering n chcr-r'
than something it.

State’s Publicity

We ﬁnd that everything of which we had intended
to speak has already been told, in one form or another.
It would seem that the necessity of being original is
forced upon us. We promise nothing.

However, being one ot’ those noblc souls who believe
in the spirit of reform, it behooves us to express our
opinion, valuable or not, upon a. number of unrelated
topics which have come to our notice from time to time.

i- l' l' i!

We would like to say a word about the reform of
the assembly programs this year. We heartily rrpprove
of the procedure so far, and actually don ’t search for
some one to fill rnrr scat. We also appreciate the
chance to grab a bite at lunch before the noon dancing.
In fact, our only adverse criticism (you expected one,
of course) is of the announcements. They are multi-
tudinous, for the most part dull, and often unnecessary.
More power to Lil and Jim for a bit of the spice of
life. lint so many of the rlronings seem most super-
llrrous, to say nothing of being unintelligible. State’s
publicity t'or'cos, through poster and newspaper, are
fairly adcqrratc. Can’t we climinnto somc of the
assembly cpitaplrs.’

v1- I' i“ I

Hpcnking of publicity, rrray wc rncntion tho posters
plastr-rcd throughout tho corridors! ()no occasionally
sci-s a crr-rlitablc advcrtiscmcnt: onr- rarcly sl'cs an
('xr't'llr‘lli onc. llaro our artists, for love ol’ work or
rnorrcy, disappoarcdt \Vo vaguely remember tho days
when thr- duty of a poster was not only to inform,
but also to arrest the altcntion. to attract the eye,
and draw the beholder irresistibly to road on and on.
As we say, the mcmorics ol’ those days arc vague indocd.
We advocate fcwcr posters, attractively colorod and
drawn, impressively striking, correctly phrased, and Irrore
advantagcously placcd.

I‘ it * A-

.-\s l'or tlrc placorrront, Ilrosc distributors who strcw
placards about tho halls would scorn to be unaware of
ccrlrrin bits of ctiqucttc. Many organizations have
individual bulletin boards: tlrcy very conceivably might
object to having them llllcrcd with announccnrcnts of
lost articles, past and comingr plays, and the like. Y.W.,
(l.;\.:\., Ncwmarr club, Htudcnt association, and Peace
clrrb are among such organizations. ’l‘lroir proscr'vcs
should be rcspcctcd.

d I- I 4'

()no last word on tho subjcct of publicity. ’l‘ako
down your poslorsl Nothing is more annoying than
to go through corridors papcrcd with announcements of
ovorrts of tho past year.
