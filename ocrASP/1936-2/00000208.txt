IT'S NOT alone what you eat that's
important. How you digest it
counts for a lot too. Camels at
mealtime help in two special ways.
They ease tension and stimulate

He knows the Arctic and the Antarctic. He
has known abysmal cold; fought his way
step by "step through howling blizzards;
lived on pemmican and biscuit. " Where I've‘
gone, Camels have gone," says S'u: Hubert.
“An explorer needs good digestion," he
continues. "In the Arctic, I take what I can
get to eat and like it. Food is monotonous
—concentrated——hastily prepared. Smoking
Camels adds gusto to my meals and brings
me a great feeling of well-being afterward.
Camels set me right! A Camel has often
given me the 'llft' I needed to carry on."
