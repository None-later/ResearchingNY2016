It’s like bringing the dead to life,
as Coach llatlield is wont to reiterate,
but we must lleeds ellat about last
Saturday night.

Aside from the tlettlal combat, the
warm reception llle State players re-
ceived stands out as a pleasing l'ea-
ture of the evening. ()aly reeently,
there has beell appointed from tlle
engineer student body a eollallittee
of lllell from the three upper elasses
to reeeive opposing tlams. This
committee is to make tlle visiting
team feel that it didn’t just more
alld go, btlt that it eultivated new
acquaintanees alal let’l t’riends
llilld. 'l‘lle eoulmittee t'unet‘iolled, too.

To progress elll'oaologieally, at tllis
point we reekon that tlle l'resllman
team played a fair brand of ball
against the Trojan yearliugs. 'l'lleir
passing was sloppy in too many
places and they sometimes moved the
system ot' etl'ense lo sideeonrt,
thereby destroying its ell'eetiveness.
liut most ol’ the tillle, they did eat-
ploy the oll'ellse tlley have been [true-
