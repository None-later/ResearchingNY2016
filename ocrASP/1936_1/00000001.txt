Three One-Act Productions
on Tuesday

The Dramaties and Art association
will present three one-act plays Tues-
day night at 8:30 o’clock in Page
hall aiutitoriuni, under the direction
of Miss Agnes Fiitterer, assistant
professor of English. For the ﬁrst:
time in the history of the college, two
of the three plays are original.
“Birthday”, o. circus play by Mrs.
Julio B. Carson, ’36, and “At More’s
Hear ”, a tragedy by Marjorie
Wheaten, ’36, were composed for the
college playwritiiig class under the
direction of Miss Fritterer. The third
play on the program is Lisa Rom-
bova’s comedy-farce, “A Man
Should Have a Wit’e”.

State college is the ﬁrst teaclier's’
college in this part ot’ the country to
otl'e' a playwritiirg course in its cur-
riculum, for the field ot' playwritiiig
in college is still iir its pioneer stages.
Since (tom-go Pierce tinker founded
