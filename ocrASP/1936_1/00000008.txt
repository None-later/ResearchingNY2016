Of course you’ll give cigarettes for Christ-
mas. They’re such an acceptable gift—such an
easy solution of your problem. And Camels
ﬁll the bill so perfectly. They’re made from
ﬁner, MORE EXPENSIVE TOBACCOS
than any other popular brand. They are
the accepted cigarette of the social and
athletic worlds.Their finer tobaccos give that
pleasant "lift”—that sense of well-being
so appropriate to the spirit of Christmas.

Fine tobacco for Christmas. For more than a
quarter of a century, the mellow fragrance
of Prince Albert has been as much a part of
Christmas as mistletoe and holly. So to the
pipe smokers on your Christmas list give
Prince Albert, "The National Joy Smoke."
It’s the welcome gift. For more men choose
Prince Albert for themselves than any other

pipe tobacco. Let every pipeful of Prince
Albert repeat "Merry Christmas" for you.
