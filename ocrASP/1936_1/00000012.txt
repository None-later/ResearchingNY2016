Niagara Defeats
State by 48-38

First Half Places State in Lead
but Visitors’ Final Spurt
Downs Home Team

In the first game of the new year
on the Page Hall court Friday, State’s
basketeers started off on the wrong
.side of the ledger by bowing to a
highly touted Niagara team 48 to 38.

Niagara started as though it would
make short work of our hopes by
scoring within a minute after the
game started. However, the State
machine began to function soon, and
momentarily tied the score at four,
only to drop behind again 11—5. At
this point the Purple and Gold again
'allicd, and within four minutes they
chalked up twelve [mints while Niag-
ara was held scoreless. All of the
men contributed to the score in this
rally that saw the new offense work
to perfection. Amyot sunk one as
the half ended with the score in
State’s favor 24 to 14.

The second half was disastrous for
State. (“aptaiu Hancroft was forced
to retire because of an injury re-
ceivod in practice. On top of this,
State had three first-string men put
.out of the game on fouls early in the
second half. Under such conditions,
Niagara began to click with (‘onuolly
and McDonald as key men. With ten
minutes to go, the score was tied at:
29 due to a long shot by Amyot.
l5‘rom here on, Niagara drew away
from State until the score read 42—33
with only minutes left to play. State
played on even terms with them until
the whistle, with the final score read-
ing Niagara 45', State :18.

John liyan, l. f., was high scorer
for State with to points, and Con-
nolly led Niagara with 1:”) points.
liynu placed two beautiful hook shots
while going away from the basket in
the tirst half, and throughout the
game Amyot, at. the guard position,
was outstanding, scoring nine points
and holding his man to four points.
liancroft made nine points while play-
ing less than half the game.

it was rumored that State replaced
h‘.l’.l. on Niagara ’s schedule as they
felt that State would make a more
interesting contest. g

In the preliminary game, the State
college freshmen lost an indifferent
game to the t'ohoes lligh school by
the large score of A14 to 23. Lehman
led the frosh with nine points.

SPORT SHOTS

 

 

 

We’d very gladly turn this week's
morsel over to Mark llellinger. We
aren’t used to writingr sob stories.

But it was a very bad week-end.
We wail for the Coach. He has the
toughest schedule State ever had
to contend with, staring; him in the
face—and only two veterans. He
has never had both of them free
from injuries.

Who can tell what the tiual
Niagara score would lmve been if
llaueroft could lmve played that.
second half. Remember we had ’em
21771-1 at the half!

We haven’t recovered from that
Queens business yet. They had no
right to be on the same court with
our squad and yet they took us over.
Wurra-wurra!

\\'hile we’re at it, we wish to tell
liaucrol't and Amyot just what we
think of them. it ’s a pleasure.
'l'hey’re the two smoothest. lads
we'\e seen wearing State jerseys.
\\'ho won’t remember .lerry playing
his heart ollt. in the hel‘nlltl half of
that Niagara disaster".1

Who'll forget Bancroft’s one-man
assault against Queens in the last
quarter? Hobbling on a painfully in-
jured foot, Skipper George pulled his
team from eight points back to one
ahead with only seconds to go. He
gave his team a lead they just
couldn't hold for him.

One ray of sunshine peeks thru
from the week-end gloom. it, or he.
is l"red llyrnes, who served notice in
the last quarter of the Niagara game

that he knows his way around a
milll‘t.. He should be right useful the

rest of tile season.

Visitors Win Close Contest
by Last Minute Scoring
of Eield Basket

State college dropped another close
game on the Page hall court Saturday
when Queens sank a basket in the ﬁnal
minute to win 28—27.

The visitors started the scoring with
a foul shot, but a short time later
Bancroft put State ahead on a foul
4—3. Amyot kept the Purple and Gold
in the running with two long shots,
and on a pass from Welter to Margi-
son, State regained the lead 11—10
with two minutes left to play in the
hult‘. At the end of the period
Queens was on top to the tune of
16—12.

lead, but with the score 22—15 State
put on their rally with Captain Ban-
crot't as the spearhead. He accounted
for eight points within three minutes,
and with the game nearing the closing
minute Queens had 26 to State’s 23.
A beautiful shot by Welter, sur-
