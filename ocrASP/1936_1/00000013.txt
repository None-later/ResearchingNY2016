Greek: to ‘Rush’
Freshman Women 7
February 6, 7, 8

Formal “rushing” of freshman
Women by campus sororities is sched-
uled to begin at 6:30 o’clock Thurs-
day night, February 6, and continue
until 11:30 o’clock Saturday morn-
ing, February 8, according to Mar-
jorie Adams, ’36, president of Inter-
sorority council.

The “rushing” parties will in-
clude, as is usual, a formal dinner
at each sorority house from 6:30
until 11:30 o’clock on Thursday
night; a tea from 3:00 until 5:00
o’clock on Friday afternoon; and a
breakfast from 9:30 until 11:30
Saturday morning. Freshmen will
receive invitations to these al't'airs
through the mail next Saturday morn-
ing, February 1, and may accept one
to each party.

The preferential system of bidding
adopted in 1933 will characterize this
year’s rushing as it has for the past
three years, Miss Adams stated.
This means that when freshmen have
received and accepted invitations to
the parties of the sororities of their
choice, they must ﬁle in the ofﬁce of
Miss l-[elen ll. Moreland, dean of
women, a list of their ﬁrst, second,
and third preferences among the
sororities. if the sorority a fresh-
man indicatcs as ﬁrst bids her, she
automatically becomes eligible for
membership to that sorority, and so
on down the list it' her ﬁrst choice
does not bid her.

Rival ClassPresidents
Face ShOWers of Music

Everything is going ’ronnd and
’round these days. Not only is
the music whirling dizzily, but so
True to form,
both are coming out of the most
unexpected places.

Herbert Drooz, sophomore pres-
ident, escorted by twenty fresh-
men, went below, below, below to
the men ’s locker room. Somebody
turned a valve, and Herbert came
out under the showers. Leslie
Knox, ’38, also went below and
came out a purged man.

In retaliation, ten stall 'art sopho-
mores banded themselves together
and conspired to kidnap Dunton
Tynan, freshman president, on a
certain Tuesday afternoon. But
soon the news went ’ronnd and
’round, and at the zero hour the
ten stalwart sophomores were met
by thirty assorted freshmen escort-
ing their beloved president. This
surprise move called for uncanny
strategy on the part of the sopho-
mores. So, the sophs lined up in
perfect formation and watched the
parade go byl

Several small skirmishes took
place between the two classes in
the vicinity of the men’s locker

room. ’l‘hese conferences had no
special signiﬁcance except that
several juniors and Potter (-11”)

plcdges’ bricks became involved in
the fay.

Y.W.’s " White Elephant” Sale

The elephants which covered the
walls and bulletinboards of the col-

lege during the past two weeks
neither pink nor blue; they were
as white as the well-known driven

snow. Their symbolism was plain to
all: a White Elephant sale.

Wednesday afternoon, eager buyers
thronng to the Lounge, to enjoy
their tea. and cookies and inspect
the “white elephants,” useless to
the givers, but, perhaps, invaluable
to the purchasers. Articles of every
description covered the bargain tables.
Jewelry, scarves, books, compacts,
shoes, blouses, and hats . . . these
are only a few of the donations of
faculty and students.

 

When student interest in the sale
began to decrease, and niekels and.
dimes rattled into the cash box less
rapidly, the Y. W., sponsors of the
event, added the note of an auctiorn
With Augusta [{atz, ’36, wielding
the hammer, birch bark baskets,
fountain pens, and band emln'oidered
linens went under the gavel.

Members of the faculty waged
bitter war over the possession of a
little contrivance for the holding of
twine. The record sale of the after-
noon was a fountain pen, which
went for the magniﬁcent price of
$.63. Total for the afternoon is
reported to be between ton and
ﬁfteen dollars.
