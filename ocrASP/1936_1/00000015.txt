absolute ncccssity to provide :Illt'tllltill' housing tor

MUST SUCH THINGS BE?

Few things can arouse our “dander” as much as the
report of the two individuals who, after being inter-
viewed by a principal for a position, decided in the
negative for reasons known in advance. It is not so
much their refusing the position as it is their failure to
notify the Appointment Bureau of their desire not to
teach in a small village, and their wasting the time and
patience of the principal who certainly must wonder
about the peculiar ways of State students.

Teaching positions are not so over-abundant that one
or two persons can afford to injure the reputation of the
Appointment Bureau or play with the disposition of a
principal to the ultimate downfall of both. Is not the
fact that each placement is worth twelve hundred dollars
to some individual suﬂlcient cause for resentment toward
those who have prevented a senior or graduate student
from securing these positions, or given the principal
sufﬁcient reason for going elsewhere in the future?

How old must one be before he (or she) is able to
determine in advance where he wants to go or what kind
of position he desires? Common courtesy should be ex-
erted to prevent the Appointment Bureau from any
repetition of this embarrassment or to keep a principal
from losing time or temper over some temperamental
senior or graduate who cannot wander far from the
homestead or is unprepared to live in some secluded ham-
let for a year or two while acquiring necessary experi-
ence. Do some people still exist who think the position
must be made for them instead ot' making themselves fit
the position?

 

RUDYARD Ki 1.) bl NG

()ne of the world’s greatest story tellers and writers
is no more. lludyurd Kipling, from whose pen ilowed
numberlcss poems, ballads, histories, essays and stories,
has gone on to whatever rewards the heavens may alter
this man that the earth did not.

Like any great man, his work was criticized because
of the basic philosophy on which his work was founded.
lint this alone is an indication of the hold his stories had
on the minds ot' people. Though many of his works
contained his empirical ideas, they also included other
phases of human interest.

llis fame and popularity declined after the war, and
what. his cvcntunl position in the history of the world’s
literature will be running for time alone to designate.
llut the world read his works and enjoyed them, and life
has been more enjoyable because he lived.

We Who are About to Die, by David Lamson. :lllti
pages. New York: Charles Hcribucr ‘s Hons. $2.50.
Within one book David launson, in a brilliant nur-

rntiou ot’ true lit’e, records the day to day roulinc ot'
a prisoner at. the Hun Quentin prison, rccords a social
document ot' importance, and maintains an unequaled
interest in his readers. The gcnc'nl tenor ot’ his re-
marks is that, prison conditions weren’t as bad as he
had expected them to be when he was sentenced, but:
that they really should, it' possible, be improved.

With a deep insight, launson, from his personal
experience, instills behind the surface ot' his pages a
prison atmosphere. He knew convicts as people rather
than us killers, and describes the whole st-t up without
bitterness, without trimmings, and he makes no itl'ort
lownrd thc sensational. 'l'lic reactions and thoughts
ot‘ mcn uudcr sculcncc ot' death are woven into u long
‘unconscious' summni'y ot' his thirtccumonth coltlitn-
un-nl at Hun Quentin.

that I might have lt‘ill'llt'tl enough not to write at all.

STATE’S STAGE

As an evening’s entertainment, the
three plays presented Tuesday night
certainly fulﬁlled their mission. There
was variety in choice of play, in act-
ing, characters, lighting, sets, and
mood. The ﬁrst play, admittedly dif-
ﬁcult to present, succeeded in carry-
ing over the footlights the atmosphere
of the sideshow. The oft-stage noises
were audible, but not too obvious.
The “ mob ” was excellent in action,
and most convincing. We nominate
Jeanne Lichcnstein as the most effec-
tive and consistent player. “Hop”
was sufficiently sinister, Mme. Alpha
sympathetic; in fact, all the people
gave an honest portrayal of the char-
acters they were representing.

The second play seemed to suit the
mood of the audience very well. It
was unmistakably a farce, exagger-
ated but funny. Miss Smith was con-
strained as Delores, but (lid an ex-
cellent job as make-up artist. Miss
Whelan and Miss Burlinglnuu vie for
acting honors both in and out of the
play. Both were excellent, contrasted
beautifully in voice and gesture, and
Miss Whelnn in particular had a nice
sense ot' comedy. She got the very
greatest moaning out; ot’ her lilies.
Mr. Rooney was too (that'cning as
“Props”. Vcllcmencc and volume
need not go hand in hand, .lohn. The
play went off very well; the well-
planned chaos was effective.

The lighting in the last play was
cxtrcnn-ly good, as were the set and
the props. Miss llnnicls did a thor-
oughly convincing bit of work its the
timid earnest. wife. She reacts quickly
to the other players, and her voice is
very charming. Miss llnner was un-
recognimlhlc in the bloudc hair. llcr
costume and make-up were excellent
and entirely in keeping with the [day’s
mood. ller speaking voice was well
adapted to the part, and she used her
low tones to their best: advantage.
.\lr. (ilcnson turned in another good
ln-rt'ornuun'c, though he seemed a
tritlc more nervous than necessary
during the. first part ot’ the play. llis
gestures were not vnricd enough, nml
seemed still and unnatural through-
out. llo carried the mood and the
suspense very well in spite of that.

The l'Ilcnn-ntnty (‘lnss has contrib-
nlcd some line work in this pcrt’orm-
uncc. (‘ongrntulaiions to the students
in the course and to those Advanced
“ltrams” who worked so diligently
with them. Al'lcr all, it is not your
fault it’ the Note audiences simply
will not behave.

Famous Actress
To Apia} Here

Dramatic and Arts Association
Will Present Ruth Draper
Next Wednesday

Dramatic and Arts association will
present Ruth Draper in the. audi-
torium of Page hall next Wednesday
night, February 5, according to
Marjorie Wheaten, ’36, president of
the association.

Miss Draper is not a monologist in
the accepted meaning of the word,
nor is she merely an actress. She is
a combination of both, with the gift
of being able to make her audiences
actually see on the stage the char-
acters which she evolves in their im-
aginations. She achieves astonishing
ctt'ects simply. On an unset stage,
Miss Draper creates an illusion of
scenery and furniture merely by the
great intelligence and understanding
of her art. With a shawl, an atro-
cious hat, a scarf, :1 fan, she changes
type as quickly :s a chann-leon.

(hailrniy to the usual custom, Miss
lirnpcr does not write down hcr dia-
logue and l-nrn her sketches; but
evolves them in her mind, and recalls
them each time they are played, so
that the" arc never twice the same. A
keen, vitally alive audience communi-
cntcs itselt' to her, and new lines
spring into being in response to un-
dcrstnnding’ laughter or quick sym-
pathy; sometimes a whole new scene
is added spontaneously.

Miss Draper recently returned to
the stage after a retirement ot' sev-
eral years, and is now on tour. She
appeared at State college in 11130 un-
der the sponsorship ot’ the Dramatic
nml Arts association.
