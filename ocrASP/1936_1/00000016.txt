Teachers Bow To Pratt In First
But: Score Over Brooklyn
Polytechnic Institute

 

 

State’s court representatives trav-
eled to the metropolitan district last
week-end amid the howls of a typical
winter blizzard and returned to the
home grounds with one loss and one
win. The Purple and Gold sutfered
their worst defeat of the season when
spanked by a strong Pratt live 40—27;
but returned to the win column the
following night in nosing out Brook-
lyn Polytechnic institute 32—29.

It. was not the lack of team play
that. cut State down in the Pratt
game. The contest was one of those
encounters in which one team cannot.
miss the basket even if it tried. (‘.lean
long shots from near center court
turned the title of victory to the
home team. In addition, the 'l‘eaclc
ers were opposing an intact; team from
last season. Glass backboards eon—
t'used State ’s men somewhat, as it: was
the Iirsl. time, the local aggregation
met with this problem.

Marglson and llershkowitl. were
high scorers with seven and six points
respectively. Mardy was high for
Pratt with seven field baskets and one
foul shot.

'l‘lieir little att'air wound,

The outlook for future marital
agreements between college men and
women appears dark, if the prospec-
,' I ' I '
tive victims of. Cupid are to be m-
tluenced by the decision handed
down in the intro-mural debate of
last Friday. The seniors upholding
the negative side of the question,
Resolved: That college men and
women should marry, were awarded
by the judges a two to one decision
for their opposition.

The negative side in supporting
their views, introduced an atmosphere
of force which continued even
through the awarding of the (loci-
sien. Among the major points pro-
poundcd to uphold their opinions,
they ott'ered that “four years of
repression in college makes a col-
lege. woman reactionary and she
wishes to be superior to her husband,
thus destroying the perfect. com-
panionship to be desired,” “fra-
ernity policies of ‘shnring,’ origi-
nating in college, would be likewise
encountered in one’s domestic circles
it’ both members were ot’ college
lineage. and would be, disastrous,”
“the upkeep ol’ college women is
staggering, ainl economic suicide
would lit' the imiIIediIIte result. of
such a union with a college woman,”
“the family oth-ctive ol’ marriage
would be destroyed in that college
women would be inclined III ‘drowii’

any oll'spring with an mg. of less
than llL’.~l," and, as n llnal stroke
in the rebuttal. i‘iti\\'lll'tl Kramer
quoted the old proverbial reason
that “the way to a man‘s heart and
marital happiness is through his
stomach, and that the -anning l’ac-

tory ot‘ the college dainc can never
hold the spot in a man’s heart III‘ a
wil'c’s home cooking.”

Among the high spots of the :tiliI'IIl-
:Itivc arguments wcrc “I'cwcr clIil~
tll'l'll, well taken cnrc III’, ol’ the col-
Icgc l'amily arc better than a small
army. Ipioting’ ‘wc can’t all be
IIiIIIIIII-s,' “college marriages iii-
cludI- the training of nonrcollcgc iii-
diiiduals plus the Iinishing cll'ccts ol'
‘I-ollcgc education," and in thc rcr
I|Int|a|. the stnlcmcnt was pI-ot’I-rrI-d
that “no matter how good one, is,
hc can lend a lil'llt'l' lift“. to he
achieved by marrying a collcgo
woman."

Hpcculnlion among the student
'lIIIIIy duringl the debate as to its out
come ran high with the negative in
iroducing such accessories as
‘t'ruity’ t'avors tor the judges and
their opponents. and a ‘scultlc III'

COMMUNICATIONS

Editor STATE Commas News:

Everyone whom I have talked with,
including seniors, can see no reason
why the senior team was awarded the
decision in last Friday’s debate.

If the Debate council had intended
to sponsor a burlesque contest, they
should have notiﬁed the sophomores
in order that the sophomore team
could have prepared to cmnpete with
the senior team.

Can the seniors truthfully say that
they won by virtue of excellence in
debate?

Three facts were evident to all who
attended:

The negative failed to establish
and prove a single main issue.
The negative rebuttal failed to
break down a single atllrmative
main issue.

The negative team failed to show
even the most elementary form
of courtesy, either to the allirm-
ative team or to the timekeeper.

Any one of these facts is stillicient
reason for awarding the decision to
the opposing team. And yet, in the
lace of all three, the negative team
was awarded the Ilecisioul

It! the judges were judging a Farm,
Ilicii the decision rightl’nlly went to
the seniors. ll’ they were judging a
debate, as they should have been Llo-
ing, thcn the decision should have gone
to the sophomores. . '

Juniors Choose
Queen Nominees

Prom Committee In Negotiating
With Eric Peterson’s Band
For Annual Dance

 

Two major developments in the
preparations for junior week-end oe-
eurretl this week. Five candidates
for Prom Queen were named by the
class in a ballot Tuesday: Rea La
Gran, Mary Lam, Claire Leonard,
l-[elen McGowan, and Alma Snyder._
0n the same day Robert Mnrgison,
chairman of the music committee for
lf’rom, began final negotiations with
Eric Peterson’s orchestra, now play-
ing at the Seven Gables Inn in West-
cIIcster, to play for the dance, Febru—
ary 2].

Voting on nominees for Queen will
take place shortly before the Prom,
and the identity of the Queen-elect
will lie kept secret until the royal
proeession descends to the Prom floor
at the close of the sixth dance. The
four other nominees who were named
on the tlrst ballot will he attendants
to the Queen.

l‘li'ie l’eterson will play for Prom if
his orchestra can suspend its present
contract with the Seven Gables.
l’ctcrson played for last year’s 'l’rom,
at; tho

and was formerly engaged
(‘luh l'ldgcwood, East. tlrcenbush.
Orchestra arrangements for both

l’i'oni and tea dance. will be completed
soon.

The junior week-cud activities in-
clude l’rom on Friday night, Febru-
ai'y L’l: the junior luncheon .S'aturday
noon, l"l'l)l'lllll'_\' 22; and the tea dance
that Iit'ternoon.

The ten dance. will be conducted
in the t‘oninions ot" the Alumni Resi-
dencc hall. The (‘ommons, linished
in green and with excellent floor and
acoustics, ot'l'crs an atmosphere such
as few State college dances have
had. 'l‘hc place For il’l'tllll will be
IIlIIItIIIIIt'I'tl shortly.

’l‘lIIIInas Mcclinn, vicevprcsidcnt of
the junior class, is general chairman
for the wcek-I-Iid. (‘lnirc Leonard is
chairman ot’ tI-a dance, and John l)eii0
and lillizahcth Meury are co-chairiiien
t'or junior luncheon.

(In II‘chrnary I all members ot’ week-
end committees who have not paid
their class Ilucs in full will be re:
moved from their positions in favor
ol’ juniors who have paid.

The junior drive for class dues con-
ducted during the. past week netted
$|t|3.7tl for three days of campaign-
ing, making the financial success of
thc week-cud relatively secure.
