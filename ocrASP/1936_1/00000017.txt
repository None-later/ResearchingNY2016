sorority, she writes down the name
on the blank. If she has a second
and third choice, she also indicates
that on the blank. At the some time,
the sororities present to Dean More-
lund’s office a list of the freshmen
whom they have decided to bid. If
a freshman is bid by the sorority of
her first choice, she automatically
becomes eligible for membership.
If she is not bid by the sorority of
her first choice, but is bid by that
of her second choice, she automati-
cally becomes eligible for member-
ship thcrc. This is also true if she
is not bid by the sorority of her
first and second choice, but is bid by
the sorority of her third choice.

“Filling a Fountain Pen

Is an Art" says Miss Fay

“When your pen repeatedly
runs dry, don’t blame the pen,”
says Miss Fay, manager of.’ the
Co-op. “You prolmbly don’t fill
it right.” Filling a pen, or
vacuum cnlisthcuics, is a complex

physical process requiring the
skillful use of both hands and
patience. Whether you have to

lift a lover or press :1. plunger, do
so carefully. The wnlls have
been recently pointed. After you
complete the mechanical motions,
don’t take your pen out ot.’ the
ink well immediately. Let it stay
there a while. Knowledge like
ink, ﬂows into vacuums slowly.

li‘urthermorc, bnukcrs tell us
that, strange as it seems, there
is :1 curious procedure to follow
when endorsing u check. All
checks are to bc cndorscd in ink,
on the reverse side, left hand cud,
and across the narrow port of
the check. it" you cure to mukc
the clulorscmcnl \‘nlid, sign your
name exactly as it is on tho chock
proper.

The (‘o—op is no bunk. ll oc-

At the end of Friday’s basketball
game between the juniors and sopho-
mores, the spectators were nearly
as worn out as the players. When
the second half started, the juniors
were leading by a score of 14—8.
'l‘hen l'lthcl Little, ’38, switched her
position from left guard to center
t'orword, and the final score was tied
22—22.

The junior forwards, Isobel and
Helen McGowan and Evelyn linmnuu,
played :1 game of brilliant pass work
with quick, sure shots. .l-ligh scorers
were Miss Little, who tallied twelve
points for her team, and Helen Mc-
(iowan, who did likewise for the
juniors.

Wednesday marked the debut of
the t‘rcsln‘nun team in inter-class
gnmcs. 'l‘hc seniors were up to
their usual form, and gave an exhi-
bition ot' cll'cctive team work.

The juniors and freshmen each
play their second game in the inter-
clnss contests when they meet on
tho Page hull court at 4le o’clock
this afternoon. A that game should
bc cxpcctcd. Both teams have prob-
obly profited from their former
matches, and we can look for some
trick plnys and passes.

girls who tool the nccd to rccupcl‘ult'
nt'tcr thc lh‘llllt‘ should sign up on
