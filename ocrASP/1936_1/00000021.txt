Te Towns Crier Rings In

AMERICA'S Public Alumnus No. i is Alexander
Woollcott. As late as his senior year at Hamilton
College (New York), his brothersjn Theta Delta Chi
didn't know whether or not they should read him out
of the club. Brother Alex persisted in wearing a red
fez about the house. No action was taken, however,
and in 1909 Woollcott received the blessing of his
Alma Mater and a Ph.B. degree.
_ Although he was a postgraduate one year at
Columbia, Alex has his fondest words and thoughts
for Hamilton. ln appreciation he received an honorary
de ee in 1924. Dramatic critic for the Times, Herald,
an§IWorld in New York from 1914 to 1928, Woollcott
has since puttered his way to a fortune as a writer
and radio star. Pudgy, preferring physical inertness,
he once acted on Broadway in a play that required
little effort beyond keeping from rolling off a divan.
Yet, in the Great War, he became a sergeant in a
hospital unit.

Had Chaucer's Cahterbury Pilgrims been recruited
in this century, they would certainly have taken
Woollcott along. and some of Chaucer's nimblest tales
would have begun this way: "Woollcott speaking."
