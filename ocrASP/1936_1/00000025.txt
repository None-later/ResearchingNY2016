Beat Plattsburg

.‘Home Team Shows Improvement
As New Semester Begins;
Score Is 49 To 37

 

After an enforced vacation of two
weeks because of mid-year exams, the
State college basketball team rc-
sumcd their schedule with a victory
in the ﬁrst game ot.’ the second semes-

'ter. The Purple and Gold travelled

to Plattsburg last Saturday to earn
a well-deserved victory over Platts-
burg Normal school when State
ronipod home on the long end of a
49 to 37 score.

Plattsburg broke into the scoring
column when Miller sank his first of
many corner shots. On a pass from
Amyot to Bancroft, State tied up
the score never to be headed again.
The long court, which gave l’latts-
burg the advantage, made the first
half a nip and tuck alt‘air. Miller
kcpt .l’lattsburg in the game with
six buckets but the consistent team-
work shown by the State baskctecrs
foretold the ultimate score. llersh-
kowitz heaved a pass the length of
the court to Dick Margison for his
first basket. On the play, Dick turned
his ankle but he continued to play.
During the half, lien Welter pleased
the crowd with two of his pivot
overhead shots from the corner. The
replacements instead of slowing
down the game spurred up the he
tion. At half time, l’lattsbnrg' had
a. chance for the game when State
led by the narrow margin of 32 to
2]

The i'asl pace that State continued

in the second half saw l’lattsbni'g
falter and drop behind never to
threaten again. The State t'orward

wall, led by Margison, ran the score
up to :59 while l'lattsburg garnered
27. Gerry Amon held .\li|ler score-
less iii this rally. With the game
almost assured, the l’urple and (iold
slowed down ainl played just hard
enough to protect the comfortable
lead that had been established. As
the iinal whistle blew, .lohnny ltyan
completed the scoring with a side
court shot that gave State it! to 2:7
for l'lattsbui'g.

The man with the injured t'oot
again was high scorer for State.
Dick Margison regained his early

season form to lead State to victory
with 12 points while Miller had eight
baskets for l’lattsburg. .\n encour
aging sight was the increased unison

shown by the forward wall of the

State machine.

scorn saors

 

 

 

One half of a rather disastrous
basketball season is behind us. Coach
Goewey’s troabtulours have had a
hit. of the worst of it so far.

But to us seasoned optimists there
are still a few very faint rays of
hope. We tackle Lowell Textile,
Bridgewater State, Syracuse, Brook-
lyn Poly, St. Michaels, and Hartwick
in that order.

This lineup shouldn’t be too tough
for Bancroft and company. We
admit Synwiise. will probably offer
a slight. problem. Even so, it' we
knock off the rest of ’cm (which we
should) we come out better than
.500 for the season.

After a quick glance at that very
tough schedule they dished up for
Coach’s debut, .500 plua looks like
a healthy average.

We predict clean cut victories over
four of the clubs. a hectic struggle
with St. Aliclniels, and a disaster at
Syracuse. llope springs eternal.

 

BECOMES MANAGER

With the resignation of Norbert
lliiber. 'Illi, from the position oi"
basketball manager following his

graduation at the close of the first
semester. Alonzo Du.\l'ont, ’ZlT, suc-
ceeds him to that position. Dullont
has been assistant nninagcr oi’ basket-
ball this season, aild also worked as
assistant manager ot’ baseball last
spring.

 

Hobart Quintet
Defeats State

Varsity Drops Pre-Exam Game
To Visiting Basketeers
By Two Points

 

 

After two trips within a week, the
State College basketball team played
ll‘obart on the Page Hall court, lt‘ri-
day, January 24. A spirited contest
saw Hobart turn back State by the
close score of 38 to 36.

State scored first, five seconds
after the opening whistle, when Bun-
crot't grabbed the tap for his first
field goal. Hobart did not liavo the
time to set up their zone defense
until State was out. in front 13 to 5.
The extensive trips under inclement
weather conditions plus the three
hard games began to show on the
State players and Hobart started to
shake their forwards, Jenkins and
Spies, loose. Despite seven points
by Captain Bancroft at half" time, the
Purple and (told was on the short end
of a iii—15 score.

The rest between halves seemed to
have given State a new impetus
when, within a few minutes after the
second half started, the home team
led 21—20. Jlobart’s zone defense
then began to lighten while the for-
ward wall ran the score to {Ill—ill.
Ai’ler State had a time out, the
'l‘eaehers put on a brict’ rally in which
lien Welter sank two of his spee-

taeiilar overhead shots to put the
State llasketecrs in the ball game
again. The pace again t’oreed State

 

to call for time within a few minutes.

STATE COLLEGE NEWS, FEBRUARY 14, 193.6

 

can. FLASHES

 

 

 

Wintry winds wailed, and bluster-
ing blizzards blew, but the brave
souls who spent three days at Camp
Johnston swear that they had a good
time. Eight girls, well equipped with
snow suits, skits, and toboggans left
college a week ago last Monday and
stayed in the cabin in the wilds of
Chatham until the following Wednes-
day afternoon. Long snoozcs in front
of the roaring fire helped them re-
euperate from exams.

State’s freshmen won an easy vic-
tory over Milne High school’s first
team in the game which was played
last Monday. The score was tied
10—10 at the half, but at the end of
the game the fresh led by a score of
22—14. Edith Bailey, ’39, was the
hiin scorer for the girls in blue.

Rumor has it that G.A.A. will co-
operate with the Troubadours in pro-
ducing a show. Something to look
forward to!

 

(icorge Bancroft led the last State
rally which knotted the score at 34
with four minutes left to play. 'l‘he
slow disappointing finish saw State
again lose a game on the foul line.
with Spies credited with three of
llobart’s t'our t'onls. The crowd that
laid yelled itself“ hoarse rend llobart

blew.

vidual star of the game when be tied

men for the entire game yet he got

Since the. Cohlcskill High school
was snowed in, the State Fresh played
a pick-up preliiniuary game with (‘ol-
lege llousc. 'l‘he well-organized li‘rosh
romped home on a 25—9 score with
