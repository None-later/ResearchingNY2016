Plan ___F_or Addition
To Milne Building

 . "Reach Completion
A three-story addition to Milne

High school to provide classrooms
for special courses in art, home eco-
nomics, dramatics and class instruc-
tion demonstrations, plus a machine
shop in the basement is planned and
will be erected during 1936 through
funds'furnished by the unemploy-
ment relief bond issue of last fall.
This project was made public by Dr.
A. R. Brubacher, president, recently.

The structure, which will cost ap-
proximately $30,000, is one which
will ﬁll a long-felt need at the Milne
High school. The art, home eco-
nomics and machine shop rooms will
enable the school to follow the course
laid down by the State Department
of Education in providing training
facilities for junior high school
teachers.

Construction of the addition, which
will be erected between Page hall
and Milne high school, will be a
comparatively short project and will
probably be completed during the
summer vacation, according to Dr.
Brubacher’s statement.

Co-op ‘Open Door’ Policy
' Aids Student Orientation

In all the turmoil and excite-
‘ment ol.’ the resumption of classes,
those few freshmen who are mak-
ing their entrance to State college
at this time are not only neg-
lected, but ignored. As a News
reporter, aware of this situation,
scouted around for a solution to
the problem, a side trip to the
Co-op seemed an excellent solution.

Miss Fay, manager of the col-
lege bookstore, especially extends
to all new students an invitation
to come in and get acquainted.
Aside from its commercial aspect,
Miss Fay points out a few of the
services and attractions of the
shop. The haunted bookshop is
an excellent place to pass a few
hours browsing among famous and
popular writers, and a place where
acquaintances are rapidly formed.
If there are questions which you
wish answered concerning time
tables of busscs or trains, the
Co-op stands at your service.
And in the financial ﬁeld, Miss
Fay will render a service to col-
lege students by endorsing checks
which they wish to cash.
