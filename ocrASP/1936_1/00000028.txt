TO THE JUNIORS
We slipped into the rotunda of State college a bit
self-consciously on that autumn day in ’33, but we wore
proudly our badges of red and white, determined to
do or die in the name of State and the Class of 1937.

But this is not enough. We must now prove our

no honor. Now we look forward to the future, toward
greater glory and successes than we have already at-
tained, not confidently but yet with hope and with the
same boundless enthusiasm which has characterized all
our activities from Freshman camp to Junior Week-cud.

To life here at State college
Where we’ve been duly sent

To learn to teach our modern youth
to be intelligent. . . .”

In this way members of the class
of 1937 voiced their class spirit in
their first inter-class rivalry sing.
Orientation was over, and ’37 had
entered into the full life of State
college. Yet impressions of the
orientation days still linger in the
minds of today’s jolly juniors—ini-
pressions of freshman 'nmp, sopho-
more and junior receptions, Activities
day, and Professor Kirtland’s now
extinct “Ed 9” course.

The most memorable events of
1937’s freshman year, of course, had
to do with rivalry, through which the
class was admirably led by its first
officers: John ileno, Alice Allard,
Lula Bailey, and John Murphy.

The sophomores took the sing and
the basketball games as rivalry got
under way, but a t'reslmian debate
team succeeded in upholding the nega-
tive side of the question, “Resolved:
That we are slowly bccoming a are

cfl'orts on the part of the sophomores
to judge the human race by them-
selves.

in May 'ame the Mascot hunt,
of which the class of 19557 enjoyed
a glorious two days. On the second
night a group of sophomore girls
raided the t‘resluuan banquet in
quest of the rcd umi white banner.
While the ‘aid was unsuccessful,
somewhere in the course ol’ events
the Richardson battery room was
entered and some damage done. The
next morning both mascot hunt and
bamicr rivalry were suspended. Two
days later both freshmen and sopho»
mores gave vent to their repressed
spirits at an all-State bonfire on the
\\'asiiingtou avcnuc 'ampus, with
songs and speeches and snake dances.

(‘amc the class’s first .\loving-up
day. Rivalry was lost, but that fact
has not dimmed impressions of big
red tics and hair ribbons, \vhilc ducks
ami dresscs, aml the silence full of
whispers during “tapping.” ()n the
preceding night the class of ’37 insti-

entation of a gift to its retiring
president. John Deno received a
State banner, and a year later John
Murphy was to receive a college key
as a token from class members.

Rivalry for the second year proved
exciting. Most interesting was the
ducking of tile freshman president
in Washington Park lake by a group
of eight sophomores who were out.
to make a story for the Soiree edition
of the News.

Banner rivalry yielded a lively
chapter in the sophomore history of
the year. The battle of March 27
in the pass to the Cafeteria and on
the plains of the Parking grounds
was a. wild sc'amblc to say the least.
The results of the battle only proved
once more how 1937 would seem fated
to get into legal difficulties at the
most trying times.

The class’s sophomore year wit-
nessed at least two important changes
in college affairs—the transfer of" a
number of" powers from Myskania
to student council, am] the formation
of a much needed .\lcu's intramural
association which was followed this
yiar by a general .\lcn’s Athletic.
association. 'l‘lnnnas Harrington was
chosen first president of the intra-
mural association.

Upon moving up to the status of
juniors the class ot’ 1937 turned its
attention to guiding its incoming
sister class. Robert .\iargison edited
the Fl't‘Sllllli’lli Handbook, and Agnes
'i‘orrcns served as chairman of the
Junior (iuide conunittcc.

Then came the junior year proper
“shades of “lid 3” and advanced
dramatics. in the fall too there were
two more notable changes in the
college—the increase of" the number
of men admitted as freshmen to loo,
and the existence of a new .\iumni
Residence hall.

The class officers for this yea' are
Alice Allard, ’i‘lionias .\Icchau, Rosc-
mary Dickinson, and llarry (iuniacr.

And as junior week-end, in spite
of" its glamour, reminds the class
that they have spent already two
and a half years of their life at
State, there is just a bit of appre-
hension of the days ahead, until like
the classes that have gone before us
we
“To the darkness turn our faces,
