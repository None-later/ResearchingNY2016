300 Words a Minute

STOOGING for Gracie Allen, one of Ted Husing's
numerous radio chores, is at best conﬁning busi«
ness for the man whose tongue and quick eye have
been ten years behind the mike. When given full
scope, as it is during the football 'season and in night
clubs. the tongue wins hordes of admirers sprinkled
liberally with enemies. For example, when Ted says
Minnesota's ’35 ﬁrst’stringers might be bench warmers
at Princeton. or some such. Or when he throws a
forked retort offrduty at critics or anyone else who
brushes with the man who has been ten years behind
v the mike.

No keener or more act
curate eye has caught a
football game. His words
come at the rate of 3,00 a
minute. Wherever a micro:
phone can be taken, in
high places and low
throughout the nation, Ted
has taken it, donned his
glasses, and cast a lean
glance at the doings. News
events, sports,s tac es~
all have been qgl'fk fodder
for his uninterrupted and

glossy announcer's techni ue.

Six feet, 168 pounds, he as played both professional
baseball and football, and can be a greater physical
menace than one would think when he bristles
frequently. Ted was born in Deming, New Mexico,
but he is a graduate of Stuyvesant hi vh school and

Columbia University in New York. In igh school he.

was a slim but alert center on the eleven, and earned
an allvcity rating.

He was a furniture salesman temporarily out of
words that really sell when he decided to try out as a
radio announcer. He went into an audition in New
York, decided he wanted the job, but there were
exactly 608 other applicants.

Ted, of course was chosen. The Camel Caravan
has brought him to the mike on Tuesday and Thursday
ni virus for a long time. Lately he has had a radio spot
0 his own—to tell of his ten years behind the mike.
College men during those ten years have learned what
