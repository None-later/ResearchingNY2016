THE junior members of

the News Board, follow-
ing‘ the week-end theme,
which places the Junior class
in the lime light, present this
rotogravure supplement as a
tribute to their class and
fellow students of State col-
lege. We wish to thank
especially the juniors and
other members of the staff
who have cooperated in this
effort and made it possible.
This supplement continues
the tradition of Junior
ascendancy on the News
during the annual Junior
Week-end.
