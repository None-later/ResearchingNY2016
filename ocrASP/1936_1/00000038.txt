For Rose Emhorn

Rose Einhorn, ’36, is winner of the
contest conducted by Myskania in
their search for new- songs to be
placed among State’s traditional
compositions. Her song, “Sing to
8.0.T.” was pronounced most accept-
able of those submitted from the
standpoints of melody, words, and
suitability for group singing.

"Miss Einhorn, a member of Alpha
Epsilon Phi sorority, has been class
aofng lender for three years, and con-
ducts a girls’ band in the Capital
district.

The words of the song, which will
be sung for the ﬁrst time in the next
assembly sing, and whose words will
be published in the college song book,
follow:

“Stand up and sing a song, raise up
a mighty voice,
And we shall all rejoice in song to

. .T.
All loyal sons will her praises sing
Till Minerva’s halls shall ring
With glorious song, as we in joyful
throng -
Proudly acclaim of her our high
esteem.
Though our echo soon be ceasing,
Her great prestige we’ll ever find
increasing.
All shall sing to her unto eternity,
Dear old N.Y.S.C.T.”

 

 

Students Attend
Pre-College Groups

lege Young Women’s Christian asso-
ciation at pro-college conferences in
Amsterdam and Schenectady, Febru—

to 10:00 o’clock.

These conferences, in which both
college cm] high school students par-
ticipate, have been instituted by the
New York Student Christian move‘
ment in order to give high school
pupils a fair unprejudiced view of
all aspects of college life. Each col-
lege student gave a ten minute speech
on some topic in which he was inter-
ested, among them extra-curricular
activities, studies, ﬁnances, social
life, fraternities, employment, and
friendships formed. After the talks,
discussion was thrown open to the
entire group. High school students
asked questions on any subject which
they considered of importance.

Colleges sending representatives to
the conference were Union college,
Rensselaer Polytechnic ins t i t u t e ,
Williams college, Colgate university,
Skidmore college, Russell Sage col-
lege, Vassar college, Cornell uni-
versity, Syracuse university, and
liamilton college.

Fresh Overcome Sophs
, Despite Kidnapping Scare

The freshman class received a
scare last Friday morning when
the alarm was spread that their
song leader, Margaret Mattison,
had been kidnapped by a group
of sophomore girls on her way to
school, leaving the class without
a lender for the rivalry sing in
the 11:10 o’clock assembly. Miss
Mattison was returned by her
kidnappers, however, at the stroke
of eleven; and the freshmen pro~
cecdcd to win the sing, netting
two and a half points in inter-
elass rivalry.

In preliminary remarks to the
decision, Dr. Harold W. Thomp-
son, professor of English and
chairman of the judges of the
sing, stated that while the
quartet and duct numbers in the
sophomore program were elliec-
tive, the extent of class partici-
pation in the freshman singing
was one of the major determining
factors in the decision. The other
judges were Miss Helen T. Fay,
manager of the Co-op, college
bookstore, and Gertrude Morgan,
’35, member of Myskania, senior
honorary society, and last year’s
student association song leader.

Miss Mattison led the freshmen
with her violin. The sophomore
song leader is Marion. Ball. Pian-
ists for the sing were Harriet
Shear, ’38, and (,‘arolyu Mattiec,
’39.

Residence Halls
Entertain Regents

The Board of Regents of the Uni-
versity of the State of New York
were entertained at luncheon in the
dining room of the Alumni Resi-
dence halls last Friday from 1:00 to
2:30 o’clock. The luncheon was
planned to coincide with the annual
meeting of the Board of Regents and
commissioners of education in order
to give them an opportunity to in-
spect the ﬁrst dormitory of a New
York teaching institution.

The Regents assembled in the
green reception room of the main
building, where they were introduced
to college students with whom they
discussed the dormitory until
luncheon. The theme of the meeting
is ably expressed in the quotation on
the menu cards: “The effectiveness
of a tire depends not only upon the
enthusiasm and skill of him who
builds and lights it but more upon
the faithfulness of him who keeps it
constantly rekindled.’ ’

cellor James Byrne, Regents Dr.
llighy, Susan Brandeis, Dr. Thomp-
son, William Leland, Dr. George
Hopkins Bond; Dr. F. l’. Graves,
