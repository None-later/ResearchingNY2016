Polytechnic Five
Returns—Tonight

State .Defeated Brooklyn Poly
During The New York Trip
By Score Of 32-29

Tonight State college will be host
on the Page hall court to a team
from New York, Brooklyn Polytechnic
institute, who were defeated by the
l'nrple and (lold on the New York
trip hy the close score of 32 to 29.
lh-ooklyn Poly handed State the only
defeat suffered last season, and the
(locwey squad is out to make a sweep
of this year’s series.

Brooklyn Poly brings a veteran
team to State with the exception of
last year‘s captain. Dilg, a forward,
who went well here last winter, is
hoping to duplicate the 15) points he
made here. The other forward,
Walter, scored 15 points in the New
York game this year and is a marked
man tonight. Poly uses either the
zone or man to man defense, depend-
ing on the opponents’ offense or
court. Last year the zone defense
worked the host of the two defenses.
'l‘lic l’oly ochnse is the first break
with the two forwards constantly cut-
ting froni side to side similar to the
old State oll'ciisc. As far as is known,
llrooklyn l’oly has had an average
SC‘ilStlll.

The State team, shattered hy iii-
jurics, will put the best team avail-
ahlc, which is still a good haskcthall
lcani, against llrooklyn Poly. John
Ryan is dclinilely lost for this coli-
lcsl hccaiise his aiiklo has not re-
spondcd to treatment. 'l‘he‘pati‘ons
are looking for Captain llaiicroft t0
rctnrn to his usual good l'orni to work
with Margison and Weller. ('onccrn-
ing weight and licighl, State measures
up favorath with l'oly. A State vic-
tory tonight would tally more wins
than losses for this semester.

In the preliminary, at T:£lti, the
Slate Freshmen are mil to avenge a.
defeat sull'crcd at lhc hands of the
chssclacr lligh school at Reiissclacr
early in the season.
