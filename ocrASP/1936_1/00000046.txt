Syracuse Bows
State Regulars

Varsity .Puts Up Valiant Fight
Against Syracuse Quintet
But Loses, 44-21

 

Fresh from a victory over Bridge-
water Teachers, the State college
basketball team traveled to Syracuse
Saturday to lose by a wide margin,
44—21, to the highly touted Syracuse
university on the Archbold court.

Syracuse, with Souderman, the
6’ 6” center, getting the tap, had little
or no difficulty in running the score
up to 16 to 4 in the ﬁrst ten minutes
before the varsity was removed.
State’s points were made by Margison
and Bancroft.

A bit of humor was enacted when
the ball rolled under the boxing ring
and four managers dressed in white
crawled under the ring to retrieve it.
The new Syracuse men. continued to
run the scare up on a nervous State
team. Balinsky was the keyman on
this offense. Dick Margison on a
cross-over was fed the ball by Ban-
croft for State’s last points in the
half which gave a Syracuse 30 to
lead.

The second half saw Syracuse put
the ﬁrst team in again. State showed
a reversal of form new. Instead of
playing Syracuse, they were playing
another basketball game. The passes
were better and the movements of the
men were surer. Syracuse was sur-
prised by this “new” team that gave
them such opposition. First one team
and then the other would get posses-
sion of the ball only to lose the ball
as the thrust was made for the basket.
Syracuse jumped the lead to 35—9
when Margison brought a cheer from
the crowd with a right hook shot while
in the air, covered by two Syracuse
men, that swished through the hoop.
Welter followed with his overhead
shot against Sondermau that got a
rise from the crowd.

“'hen twelve minutes had been com-
pleted in the half, both teams had
scored live points (35—13). Syracuse
put in the second team to see what
they could do against an inspired Pur-
ple and Gold. The freshmen ran the
score up to xii—14 but the original
five men answered this fast pace by
taking command of the court to go
on a small scoring spree with Mar-
gison in the loading rolc. Bulger had
to jump in the air, going away from
the basket, to get his bucket in this
rally.

The filial score for State was :1
Syracuse play. \Vcllur snurcd iln- ball
under his own basket and on n lob
pass to Margison gave him his chance
for another basket. Syracuse ended
the scoring when llnylock sunk a
basket just before the ﬁnal whistle.
The final score was Syracuse 4-1,
Slate 21.

llick Margison was high man on the
ﬂoor with ll points, while llalinsky
led Syracuse with 1.0 points. Slate
had the “jitters” in the ﬁrst hall" and
missed many pushvnp shots that: under
normal conditions are sure scorers.
llnncrot’t had his worst night of this
season where with any breaks at all
he would have been in the double num-
bers. llorshkowitz reached his all-
limc high as a State guard. lie was
all over the court, going at a very
fast pace, which was a constant on—
noyance to Syracuse. Welter played
skyscraper Sondcrmau to a slnndslill.

’l‘he vaunted Syracuse buckcl play
worked only three times in the whole
game. Sondermau got 22 points
against Pennsylvania and l8 against
Notrc llume, yct lien hold him to seven
points in the twenty-llvc minulcs he
played.

Varsity Defeats
Bridgewater Men

Basketeers Score Victory Friday
Over Massachusetts Team
By 51-30 Score

The State college basketball team
gave the patrons a scare last Friday
on the Page hall court before down-
ing Bridgewnter State Teachers col-
lege from Massachusetts 51 to 30.

State started the ﬁrst of the many
(5) games without the needed service
of Jerry Amyot, due to a chipped
linger joint. Bancroft sunk two foul
shots and this constituted the State
score for the first ten minutes.
Bridgewater Teachers adapted their
attack to our court and worked up a
12 to 2 lead with Long dominating
the play. Two players were injured
in this rally. J. Ryan was forced to
leave the game because of an injured
ankle. Long injured his right arm
and shoulder when he tripped over
llancroft’s leg to slide into the
blecchers.

With Long out, llridgewater bogged
down while State, paced by Margisen
and Bancroft, ran up twelve points.
Dick Margison made two clean buck-
ets on passes from Bancroft. Duke
i’ed Bancroft a long pass to the side
of the court. which be converted. The
small crowd did not know what to ex-
pect in the second half because of the
erratic showing in this half, which
gave State 14 to Bridgewatcr’s 12.

‘As the second half opened, the
Purple and Gold continued the play
shown late in the first half. Bancroft
and Margison continued to click and
Welter also began to figure in the
offense. From Welter’s tnp until a
forward sank the ball, State had pos-
session of the ball almost continu-
ously. Welter had two overhead shots
from the corner in this rally. Neither
llancroi't nor Margison had spectacu-
lur shots, but their harmony in cut-
ing, passing, and i’cinting until one
or the other sank a basket were a joy
to behold.

State replacements began to appear
in the line-up when the Purple and
Gold had a 34—17 lead. Whether the
rcplm-cmcnls were “cold” or nerv-
ous, the fact remains that Bridge-
wul'cr came on with a surge to trail
by 28 to 30. The regulars could not
be saved for the game the next night
against Syracuse but they had to go
to work again. Bridgewater was
stopped in their tracks while Stale
put on another show for the gallery.
This rally became a farce with no one
on Bridgewatcr able to stop Bancroft
from making eight points in live min-
nice and yet give good “feeds” to
Mnrgison on his cutbacks. The final
score was Slate ﬁl, llridgmvntcr Stale
Teachers 30.

('nplnin llnncroft was high man on
tho iloor with twenty-one and Long
lcd Bridgewater Teachers with twelve
points. The State forward wall, as
an indication of the smoothness with
which they work, scored ii points.

Baseball Varsity
Has Ei ht Games
On 1 36 Schedule

The 1936 baseball varsity of State
college will face an eight game
schedule this spring with the open-
ing game on Saturday, April 25.
The schedule according to Fred Dex-
ter, ’37, manager, is as follows:

Bard College April 25 (here)

Hartwick College May 2 (here)

Lowell Textile Institute May 8
(here)

Drew University May 12 (here)

Pratt Institute May 16 (there)

I'Iartwick College May 20 (there)

Norwich University May 23 (there)

St. Michaels May 30 (here)

Practice for the intensive schedule
will begin the ﬁrst week in April,
with possibly indoor pitching prae~
tice before this.

The varsity this year will follow
the precedent of the basketball
varsity and will include only under-
graduate students. Cullen and
Sclnnitz will continue on the mound,
with Amyot, Quigley, Young and
Byrucs, also members of last year’s
varsity, likewise holding positions on
the nine.

Considerable interest in the sched-
ule this year has been shown by the
freshman men, and a number of first
year men will probably be mnong
the initial try-outs with the possi-
bility of several of thorn holding down
regular positions during the course
of the season.

Juniors Win First
lntra-mural Round,

1938 Leads Second ' ‘

Due to information which at the
time seemed true, it was erroneously
stated in last week’s NEWS that the
sophomores won the ﬁrst half of the
men’s intro-mural basketball schedule.

According to Thomas Harrington,
’37, president of the Men’s intra-
mural association, the sophomores are
only leading the second round of the
basketball loop. The juniors won the
first round with an average of .750.
The standing of the teams were as
follows:

Won Lost Percent
Juniors 3 1 .750
Seniors ‘1 2 .500
Sophomores 2 2 .500
Freshmen l. 3 .350

So far in the second round, the
sophomores are leading with an aver-
age of 1.000. The teams stand in the
following order:

Won Lost Percent
Sophomores 2 0 1.000
Freslnncn 1. 1 .500
Juniors 0 1 .000
Seniors 0 1 .000

11’ the sophomores are \‘lclOl'S in this
round, they will meet the juniors in a
play-oli‘ mulch to decide the intra-
mural champion.

SPORT ~ snors 

We see, especially by the Syracuse
papers, that the lads did very poorly
as giant killers. A case of the
mountain not coming to Mahomet,
and Mahomet not making good on the
climb. A had hit of schedule—'
scheduling.

A tasty morsel is being dished up
tonight. Our hopefuls lock horns
with Brooklyn 's Engineers. We
wheedled out an early season win
over the blue-printers, and they’re
primed for revenge.

Mebbe they’ll get it. They al-
ways have been a large problem for
we-nns and, in our time, we’ve never
nmdc a. clean sweep in any one season.

None the less, this pillar of wisddm
strings along with the home-towners.
We are now giving Henry McNeinore
of the A. P. a keen contest for the
world’s worst predictor. He slipped
badly last week-end, actually calling
the winner of the Santa-Anita handi-
cap. We proudly boast that we
haven't picked a winner since I
