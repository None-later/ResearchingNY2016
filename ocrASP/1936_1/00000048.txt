College Representatives Protest

Passage of Student Oath Bill

 

Students Register Objections
To Compulsory Allegiance

At Senate Hearing

 

Over two hundred students, repre-
sentatives ot’ New York state colleges
and student; organizations, crowded
the Senate chambers on Tuesday
afternoon at the open hearing to pro-
test the Nunan student oath bill.

This bill, introduced by Senator
Joseph D. Nunan last year, passed
the Senate, lint was not reported out
of committee in the Assembly, largely
due to a public hearing in which more
than thirty colleges and high schools,
student and tciichcrs’ organimitioiis.
protested its passage. Thus, although
the bill passed the Senate, it never
came to a vote in the Assembly, but
has been reintroduced this year.

During the hearing, students from
over twelve colleges spoke, expressing
the view taken by their student body.
Representatives ot' the American Stu-
dent iinioii and ot.’ the National Stu-
dent lt‘ederation ot’ America, repre-
senting twenty-five colleges, came out
in opposition to the bill. Among
other speakers were communist and
socialist representatives, high school
and college instructors, and a speaker
for the American association ot’ Uni-
versity Professors.

One ot' the strongest arguments
against the bill was that it would
either prevent foreign students and
students at other states from attend-
ing our colleges, or it. would require
them to declare their loyalty to a
system ot' government which might be
directly opposed to their native sys»
tom. This, however, could be taken
care ot’ by an amendment: to the
existing bill.

Other reasons presented by the op-
ponents ot’ the bill were the fact that

those who could not take the oath
because they did not believe in it
would be deprived ot’ a chance to

learn, in college or university, to un-
derstiiiid and believe in it. Others
stated that they feared the bill might
become the first. step in the acquisition
ot’ dictatorial power by the state,
reading into the bill ii desire to con-
trol education as in Fascist states in
Europe. Another remarked that the
legislators themselves must doubt the
soundness of American institutions if
they felt it: necessary to enact a law
forcing students to pledge their in)“
iilty to these institutions.

State college ilsclt’ wciit on record
in last li‘riday’s llzltl o’clock assem-
bly, as dctiiiitcly opposed to the pas-
sage ot’ the Nunan student oath bill.

NUNAN PLEDGE ACT

The bill introduced by Senator
Joseph Nunan reads, in part, as
follows: It is an "oath to sup-
port federal and state constitu-
tions to be taken by students in
universities, colleges and normal
chools”. After September 1,
1938, every student admitted to

a “university, college, normal
school, or other institution of
higher education supported in

whole or in part by public funds
shall take and subscribe the fol-
lowing oath or afﬁrmation: ‘I
do solemnly swear (or afﬁrm)
that I will support the constitu-
tion of the United States of
America and the constitution of
the state of New York as a
student of (here insert the name
or designation of university, col-
lege, normal school or other
institution).’ "

 

King James of Leap Year
Rules D.O. As ‘Best Bet’

As the “Best Bet of 1936”
James Campbell, ’36, carried
away top honors at the Leap Year
party at; Delta Omega sorority
Saturday night. Winning his
title by popular vote, Campbell
was crowned by the runner-up in
the contest, Paul Bulger, ’36,
amidst considerable pomp and cere-
mony. Elizabeth Matthews, ’38
and Doris Palmer, ’39, were at-
tcndants.

As the “Best Bet” was
crowned, the tally ot' votes was
announced, showing Campbell had

won the title with ii score ot‘
151% points to the 150 points
of his closet rival, lliilger. Ilis
biggest score can be attributed

to his ability to say ‘no’ netting
him 100 points. Rome doubt was
expressed as to the reliability ot'
this, when (‘iiinpbell stated that
he had received only one proposal.
Other points which he received
were ‘35 for not being able to
sing, 51.4, for looking well under a
crown, and ltll/l t’or beauty.
