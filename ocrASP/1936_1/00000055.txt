State Team Will
Meet St. Michael

Weave Offense To Aid Opponents
Noted For Fast Playing;
Ryan Rejoins Squad

The State college basketball team
is home tomorrow night to an old yet
new opponent, St. Michael from
Winooski Park, Vermont. St. Mi-
chael did not appear on the State
schedule last year, but they had in
the years preceding this short break
in relationships.

After exploring all local sources of
information, the advance information
on St. Michael is woefully lacking as
to the men to watch on the offense.
'They use a man-to-man defense and
'a. fast breaking weave offense. State
will have to be ever alert in order to
get possession of the ball once the
weave begins. Since St. Michael
plays such teams as Massachusetts
Institute of Technology, Middlebury,
and St. Lawrence, the conqueror of
Syracuse. who downed St. Michael
last Saturday, 5] to 32, they will
be out there tomorrow night with the
hope of returning to the path of vic-
tory.

On the other hand, the Purple and
Gold, fresh from a victory over
Brooklyn Polytechnic institute, cher-
ish the idea of a three game winning
streak to conclude this season. In
addition to the starters of the Brook-
lyn Poly game, Coach Goewey will
use Johnny Ryan. Ryan’s ankle is
at last responding to treatment and
he will be able to play for a few min-
utes when State needs points in a
rally. Captain Bancroft is the only
man left on the squad who faced St.
Michael when’they were here two
years ago. The State hasketeers will
have to be in “top” form to get the
nod of victory from this fast moving
team.

The preliminary game at 7:30
brings the strong Watervliet High
school team from Watervliet as oppo-
nents to the State freshmen.

SPORT SHOTS

 

 

 

Fresh from our triumphant choice
of State over Brooklyn Polytechnic,
we make the following report on
tomorrow’s game. First, let us look
at the dope (we are not referrin
to the editor-in-chief'of this stai
bulletin.)

State
morrow.

plays St. Michael’s to-

.Niagara defeated State
48-438. Niagara defeated Syracuse
34-430. That makes Syracuse ex-
actly 14 points better than State.
(Let ’s_forget all about the Syracuse
game, if you don’t mind.)

Now, are you listening? St.
Lawrence beat Syracuae 38-31. So
far, they ’re three points better than
Niagara. St. Lawrence also took
St. Michael’s 51—32. Then St.
Lawrence beat Niagara (or Niagara
beat St. Lawrence—I’m not sure,
but it was one or the other) 35—34
in an overtime period.

By simple addition, we ﬁnd that
Syracuse is 14 points better than

St. Michael’s. Being 14 points
better than St. Michael’s, and 14
better than us, this conclusively

proves that Syracuse could trounce
either of us.

'l'lierei‘ore we pick Notre Dame to
beat Ohio State. the Red Sox to
win the World Series, and an over-
time period tomorrow night.

If you can’t stand these nerve-
wracking close games, stay home
and wait for the whole thing to
blow over. Some one will tell you
all about it Monday morning.

C.C.C. Director
Asks Student Aid
In Camp Program

William l3. Van Buskirk, educa-
lionnl director of the Civilian Con-
scrvalioil (‘orps camp situated at
'l‘annersville, New York, requests
help, through the student council of
the college, in the establishment of
his educational program in the camp.

The director asks for speakers,
debaters. or lecturers on any sub-
ject which he considers would be of
interest and benefit to the cnrollccs.
He also asks for the contribution by
students oi’ old textbooks, pamphlets,
discarded typewriters, or any material
which niighi be used to advantage in
his work.

The camps, located in states all
over the nation, are attempting, in
this way, through the National Stu-
dent ll‘ederation of America, to
establish relations between the col-
lege students and the enrollces of
the civilian camps. The contacts
formed will be of value to both. The
men in the camps will derive enjoy-
ineni and instruction, and the col-
lege students, practice in speaking.

(‘ollege men and members of the
faculty who would be interested in
speaking at the camps should sign
up on the main bulletin board in the
rotunda oi' liraper hall, listing the
subject on which they would like to
s'n‘Hli. .\lr. \':in ankirk will decide
whether or noi the Sli‘llll‘l‘l holds
inlcrosi for his camp.

 

Inquiry Into Secrets of Makeup
Reveals Problems of Thespians

“Individuality is expressed in
cvcry character make-up. and personal
experience to liiid onc’s medium is
the best teacher in preparing for this
complex study,” stated Miss Agnes
l‘l. l"nttcrer, assistant professor of
l‘lnglisll, in an interview with your
inquiring reporter.

Most of the students at Hluic of
loud the productions of tile Advanced
lli'lllllllllt'rl class, which Miss Fultcrcr
icnches, without realizing the vast
amount of work and ininulc details
involved in the preparation of the
players for their individual roles. A
simple l’ncc innkciip will include not
only the barest application of neces-
sary colors, but a character study
lypifying a definite role iiiviilvcs carc-
ful consideration of many factors lll
order to secure desired effects.

The first step in making up a mem
ber of the east, Miss Buttercr muni-
taiiis, is a study of the face to see
what definite type it is and to discern
the proper location for shadmvs to
portray the character part. her ex-
uinple, a young girl With full checks
is difﬁcult to make up into an coinci-
ated, old woman, but, with the proper
lining of shadows, she could be cus'
very well as a ruddy~eonipleirioned,

round, old woman.

 

The application oi’ cold cream pre-
cedes Ihc use of a combination of
grease points which form the bases to
i-owr the entire l’acinl tissues. When
blocking in shadows, the expert musl
Idond the dominant shadows under the
check bones, temples, cye sockets, or
under ilie chin, with the basic coloring.

The make up of" n character study
is as essential to the port as the
memorization oi' the lines oi’ the play,
for the features of“ n young-looking
actor only lime to be changed i'inli»
coliy Io suit his role of an old mini.
'l‘ricks exist in all professions, and
llll' url of make-up is no exception,
since it most employ all the technical
aids nl its command. if a person has
a nose too thin to look like a negro
with broad nostiils, a line across his
nose will give it the proper degree of
width. in old age parts, the pliiyor
must have his bnnds properly lined in
the knuckles and on the back of the
hand to show his ago. 0n the fore
bend, brown grease paint is used to
give old age lines.

Aside from the learning gleaned
from books, Miss Futterer added that
her study of character in the paint:-
lugs oi‘ the great: masters, such as

t ileinln'inidt, proves as valuable in her

preparation for a difﬁcult character
makeup as the actual past experience.

Erratic Playing Features Second
Victory Over Brooklyn Five
For Series Sweep

The State college basketball team
accomplished a feat Friday, that of
sweeping the Brooklyn Polytechnic
institute home and home series, which
has eluded State baskcteers for many
a year. The Page hall court was the
scene of the coup that saw State down
the Brooklyn Poly team 38 to 31.

After Brooklyn had missed many
shots and follow-ups, George Bancroft
started the scoring with a foul shot
which was soon followed by his field
basket from the side court. Len
Welter put State ahead, 5—4, on a
long overhead shot. Bancroft tied
the score at 11 with one of his five
successful foul shots in this half.
State again dropped behind, but
Duke I'lershkowitz sank a basket from
side mid-court that again knotted the
count at 15. With four minutes to
go in this half, the hip and elbow
boys from Brooklyn garnered six
points while Dick Margison earned
State’s three. Brooklyn Poly had a
slim lead, 21—18, at half time.

The second half opened with Mar-
gison sinking a corner shot. Then,
when Captain Bancroft tapped in a
follow-up shot, State had a momentary
lead, but a successful foul try by
Viilanti wiped out the State advan-

tage. The State machine fortunately
lost the “lmtterflngers” that had

been evident most of the evening.
Mai-gison’s bucket a minute later
created the last tie in the game, 27
all. Paul Bulger let fly one of his
nndcrluind specialty shots that. put
the Purple. and Gold on the victory
trail. The last three 'l‘eachers’ points
were earned on the foul line, bringing
the State poiiiis from iliis source up to
eighteen. The scoreboard ’3 final
reading showed State with 38 to
Brooklyn Polytechnic iiisiitutc’s 3].

f‘apiain Bancroft returned to form
to lead his ieaiii to victory with fif-
ieeil points. Dilg was high for l’oly
with seven points, all of which were
scored in the first half. As an exam-
ple of the number of fouls committed
by l’oly, the State forwards earned
ten of” their twenty-six points on the
foul line. .

These points were the difference
between defeat or victory.

in the best preliminary game of
this season, the Bensselaer lligh
school was given the nod over the
freshmen by the score of ‘25 to 22.
The score was tied at half time, 12
all, and at the end of the third quar-
ter, 18 all, but Thompson came
through for Bcnsselaer in the closing
minute. (ieorge Amyol was high man
for the f’rosh with six points, and

 
 

'l‘hompson was credited with foil
poiiiis i’or llcnsselner lligh.
