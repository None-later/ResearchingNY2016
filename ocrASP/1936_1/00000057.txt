issues To Face
Next—Assembly

Amendments To Constitution,
By-Laws Will Be Subject

Of Discussion
An amendment to the Student
Association Constitution and an

amendment to the By-Laws, intro-
duced in last week’s assembly, will
be on the assembly calendar next
Friday after being posted for two
weeks in accordance with the rules
of the association. The constitu-
tional amendment would transfer the
regulation of Moving-up Day and of
inter-class rivalry from student
council to Myskaiiia, senior honorary
society. The addition to the By-
Laws would make every sixth assem-
bly program a business meeting for
the discussion of student ati‘airs
alone.

The proposed transfer of powers

from student council to Myskania
would iiol go into effect until next
fall, according to the resolution.

\‘irginia Stool, ’37, who introduced
the amendment, made the following
statement to the NEWS:

“The control of Moving-up Day
by Myskania is in accordance with
the feeling that this day is the senior-
class’s last function as a part of the
undergraduate body, and therefore
should be managed by seniors.

“The transfer of inter-class
rivalry regulation to '.\lyskania is
important in the elimination ot'
representatives of both the two lower
classes from participation in meet-
ings regarding a matter in which
each has a rival interest. Secrecy
is an important factor in the fair
conduct of rivalry, and Mysliania,
as a secret and senior body, seems
the ﬁtting agent in this case. Since
inter-class rivalry is so closely asso-
ciated with Moving-up events, it
seems logical to make use of the
same senior body to regulate it.”

The text of the amendment is as
follows: “Resolved: To amend the

State May Enact
$50 Eugen Bill

Legislature To consider Passage
Of- Act Requiring Students
To Pay Annual Fee

Legislation on Capitol Hill this
week assumed proportions which will
drastically alfect State college with
the introductimr of a bill which would
establish a tuition fee of $50 a year
for all students. This bill was insti-
tuted by Assemblyman Abbot Low
Motl'at, chairman of the Ways and
Means committee, and would be effec-
tive on July 1, 1936.

The bill is a direct outcome of the
Republican program to cut the Gov-
ernor’s budget, and is intended to net
the State approximately $400,000 per
year. This money would not be used
in connection with the educational in-
stitutions, but would be entered in
the general fund and would replace
moneys which have previously been
secured through the one cent emer-
gency gas tax.

The section of the bill which would
establish this tuition is as follows:
“livery student admitted to a state
normal school or a state college for
teachers and pursuing any regular
course of study therein for the com-
pletioii of which a diploma may be
granted or a degree conferred and
not including the instruction, service
and sessions described in subdivision
two hereof, shall pay animal tuition
of ﬁfty dollars if, at the time of such
admission or of any annual registra-
tion, he or she is a bona tide resident
ot' this state, and, if not then such a.
resident, shall pay annual tuition the
amount of which shall be fixed from
time to time by the education depart-
ment of not less than fifty dollars.
Applicants for admission to such a
school or college shall present such
evidences of proﬁciency or be subject
to such examination as shall be pre—
scribed by such department. Moneys
derived from such tnilioii paid by
resident students and up to lit’ty dol-
ars of the amount collected after
