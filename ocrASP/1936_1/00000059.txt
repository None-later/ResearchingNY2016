Purple And Gold Squad Leads
St. Michael By 31~24 Score;
Fresh Lose Again

 

The State college basketball teain
set a. new high winning streak for
this season when they won their
second, consecutive game last Satur-
day on the Page hall court. The
Purple and Gold administered the
defeat to the St. Michael team, 31
.to 24.

With a very slow start on the part
of both teams, it took St. Michael
five minutes to score four points
while State labored with a goose-egg
for their elforts. The State has-
ketcers seemed to have forgotten all
the basketball they knew because, as
soon as they obtained possession of
the ball, the back guard would come
up slowly and feed the ball to the
ﬁrst man that cut regardless of
whether he was covered or not. This
folly on the part of the Purple and
Gold dominated their play in the
first half and occasionally reared its
head in the second half. The rumor
that circulated during the later part
of the week was coulirmed when
Jerry Amyot trotted out on the
floor to take his familiar guard posi-
tion with live minutes gone in the
half. Jerry assumed the attack role
immediately when, after circling
around under the basket to break
clear, he leaped into the air to drop
a left hand hook shot for State’s
lirst points. After this shot, the
State machine allowed St. Michael
to run up the score while the l’urplc
and (laid collected two foul points.
With three minutes to go in the hall‘.
the Teachers, consciously or uneou«
sciously, began to play their normal
game of basketball. The State team
scored seven points, four of which
were contributed by two long shots
.by Duke l'lershkowitz, in this rally
that knotted the score at ll all
when the half ended. The State dc
fense was the only thing that kept
the ’l‘cachers in the game and made
the game, for the spectators, inter-
‘esting in respect, to the close score.

State immediately took charge of
the situation when the second hah’
opened and made the play go as they
desired it. Dick Margison. on a pass
from .llanerot’t, put State in a l.".—ll
load but, after Hurley’s t'oul shot,
Landers sank a bucket to give St.
Michael their last lead. At’tcr l.en
Weller knotted the count at l-i. .lerry
Amyot registered two baskets that
were the “tops” for the evening.
The lirst‘ shot was a one haml catch
at Wcltcr's pass that .lerry pushed
up and in while he was in the air.
The other shot that brought a cheer
from the crowd and a time out for
Hi. Michael was a loft band book
shot while he was twisting his body
from contact with the man guarding
him. As a result, the 'l‘cachcr~ had
an lSvlrl lead. A few minutes later.
the crowd’s boos at the rct'crccing
were changed to cheers for the .N'talc

game of this season. For which we
can almost sing praise to Allah.

It’s been a rough year. The lads
have not only had the most rugged
schedule a State team has ever been
asked to wallow thru, but they’ve
managed to drop a couple here and
there to teams that had no business
on the same court with them.

We refer to the little alfair with
Queens university for example. How
we managed to lose that little nqu-
hcr (lelics explanation. Maybe they
did it with mirrors.

The ﬁrst affair with Hartwick was
another of those things, we under-
stand. We’ll know after tomorrow
when we get a return crack at them.

State Will Meet
Hartwick Quintet

Team To End Season Tomorrow;
Baketeers Hope For Third
Consecutive Win

 

 

The State college basketball team
brings their long, hard season to a
close tomorrow night on the Page
hall court when they face Hartwiek
college from Oneonta. Since the
State team lost a close game, 27—25,
just before mid-year’s to this aggre-
gation on their bandbox court, the
Purple and Gold are determined not
to be whitewashed in this return.
Another strong incentive is to ex-
tend the two game winning streak
into a three game winning streak and
to end the season with a win. This
game marks the farewell appearance
for Amyot, Albrecht, Bulger, and
Welter as far as basketball is con-
cerned.

Although .llartwick has had an
average season, they bring a strong,
experienced team who hope to sweep
this series as State did the Brooklyn
l’oly series. The oli'ense starts from
the weave of the guards that turns
into either a block play or a piek-oti’.
They have a system of pass work
that avoids the rules concerning this
supposed illegal play. Although
.\lcl:‘ce is a short man in comparison
to his teammates, he is very fast,
shitty, and tricky so that the above

plays work. The other forward,
ltamson, won the game for Hart-
wick with eleven points, but. the

’l‘eaehers row that he will not be in
the double iigures Saturday. The
center is a tall, lanky man who
generally goes well on a court our
size. The guards, as a rule do not
feature in the scoring but give their
atlention to defense.

llartwick college will present a
zone defense that is compact. if a
team had long shot artists, this de-
fense is easily disorganized on an
average sized court.

in the preliminary game, the freslr
men will meet the Eastman Business
school of Saratoga.

Coach Goewey Plans to Build
Basketball Tradition for State

“One of my chief aims will be to
lmild a basketball tradition at State
college,” stated C‘oach Goewey at a
recent interview. “lly a basketball
tradition,” he went on, “I mean that;
State should build up a reputation for
having a strong basketball team, just;
as other colleges build up reputations
for having strong football learns.”

('onch (ioewcy plans to build up the
tradition by means of two methods:
(1) by awakening a stronger interest
aml appreciation ot’ basketball in the
men of State college. (2) by develop
ing poweri'ul varsity teams.

l"or the past six weeks, (‘oach
(ltwwey has been putting into opera

will ultimately lead to the second.

State Graduates
Attain Promotion

Word has reached State that two
of its former graduates have been
advanced recently in the education
annals of the Capital District.

Louis M. Klein, a graduate of the
class of 1929, was appointed super-
intendent ot' schools of Harrison in
\\'estchester county. His close friend,
Alexander Arning, has been pro-
moted to principal of Harrison high
school.

Mr. Klein has held the post of
principal since the fall of 1934, and
Mr. Aruiug, who will succeed him
as the new principal, was elevated
from his position as teacher and
chairman ot‘ the mathematics and
science departments.
