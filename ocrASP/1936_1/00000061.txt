Purple And Gold Squad Leads
St. Michael By 31-24 Score;
Frosh Lose Again

 

The State college basketball teain
:set a new high winning streak for
this season when they won their
second, consecutive game last Satur-
day on the Page hall court. The
Purple and Gold administered the
.defeat to the St. Michael team, 31
.to 24.

With a very slow start on the part
of both teams, it took St. Michael
ﬁve minutes to score four points
while State labored with a goose-egg
for their ell’orts. The State has-
keteers seemed to have forgotten all
the basketball they knew because, as
soon as they obtained possession ol’
the ball, the back guard would come
up slowly and feed the ball to the
first man that cut regardless of
whether he was covered or not. This
folly on the part of the l’urple and
Gold dominated their play in the
ﬁrst half and occasionally rcarcd its
head in the second halt‘. The rumor
that circulated during the later part

of the week was continued when
.l'crry Amyot trotted out on the
lloor to take his familiar guard posi-
tion with live minutes gone in the
half. .lcrry assumed the attack role
immediately when, after circling
around under the basket to break

clear, he leaped into the air to drop

a left hand hook shot for State’s
iirst points. After this shot, the
State machine allowed St. Michael

to run up the score while the Purple
and Gold collected two t'oul points.
With three minutes to go in the half,
the Teachers, consciously or uncon-
sciously, began to play their normal
game of basketball. The State team
scored seven points, four of which
were contributed by two long shots
by Duke llershkowitz, in this rally
that knotted the score at ll all
when the half ended. The State dc-
fcnse was the only thing that kept
the ’l‘uichers iii the game and inadc
the game, for the spectators, intcr-
-esting in respect to the close scorc.

State immediately took charge of
the situation when the second half
vopened aml made the play go as they
desired it. Dick Margisoii, on a pass
from liancrot't, put State in a lit—ll
lead but, after lliirlcy’s i’oul shot,
Liiiiders sank a bucket to give St.
Michael their last lead. At’tcr Lcii
Welter knotted thc count iit l-t. .lcri'y
Amyot registered two baskets that
were the “l'ops’l tor the evening.
The lirst shot was a oiic hand catch

The otlicr shot that brought a chccr

SPORT SHOTS

 

 

 

Well, we’ve come to the end of
the trail. Tomorrow we see the last
game of this season. For which we
can almost sing praise to Allah.

It’s been a rough year. The lads
have not only had the most rugged
schedule a State team has ever been
asked to wallow thru, but they’ve
managed to drop a couple here and
there to teams that had no business
on the same court with them.

We refer to the little affair with
Queens university for example. How
we managed to lose that little num-
ber dclies explanation. Maybe they
did it with mirrors.

The ﬁrst affair with Hartwick was
another of those things, we under-

 

(‘oplaiml

stand. We’ll know after tomorrow
when we get a return crack at them.

Who said they never come brick?
We predict a State victory by eight
points. We guarantee that the pride
of the llancroits—young George, gets
It points or better tomorrow. Come
around and see for yourself.

State Will Meet
Hartwick Quintet

Team To End Season Tomorrow;
Basketeers Hope For Third
Consecutive Win

 

 

The State college basketball team
brings their long, hard season to a
close tomorrow night on the Page
hall court when they face Hartwiek

 

college from Oneonta. Since the
State team lost a close game, 27-25,
just before mid-year’s to this aggre-
gation on their bandbox court, the
Purple and Gold are determined not
to be whitewashed in this return.
Another strong incentive is to ex-
tend the two game winning streak
iiito a three game winning streak and
to end the season with a win. This
game marks the farewell appearance

for Amyot, Albrecht, Bulger, and
Welter as far as basketball is con-
ccriied.

Although llartwick has had an

average season, they bring a strong,

 

 

experienced team who hope to sweep
this series as State did the Brooklyn
l’oly series. The oil'eiisc starts from
the weave of the guards that turns
into either a block play or a pick-oil'.
They have a system of pass work
that avoids the rules concerning this
supposed illegal play. Although
Mcl‘ku,‘ is a short man in comparison
to his teammates, he is very fast,
shit’ty, and trinky so that the above

plays work. The other forward,
liainson, won the game for Hart-
wick with eleven points, but the
'l'eachcrs vow that he will not be in
the double iigures Saturday. The
center is a tall, lanky man who

generally goes well on a court our
size. The guards, as a rule do not
feature in the scoring but give their
attention to defense.

llartwick college will present a
zone defense that is compact. H" a
team had long shot artists, this de-
t'cusc is easily disorganized on an
average sized court.

In the preliminary game, the fresh-

 

men will meet the Eastman Business
school of Saratogu.

 

lessens GAMBOLS

Freshmen sure keep the sorors busy
what with pledge services and instal-

 

lations. Other things keep the aorors

busy too. . . Phi Delta welcomed
into full membership Marie Katz-
maier, Virginia Travis, and Helen
Williams, sophomores, and Helen
Lowry, ’39. At Phi Lambda, Mary
Elinendorf, ’36, and Lois “'ester and
Zelda Uthe, freshmen, took the ﬁnal
vows while Evelyn Lindros and Alice
lliirlbut, juniors, took the pledge
vows. Slicrle Goldstone, ’36, Gert-
rude Lerner, ’38, mid Beatrice
Koblenz, Charlotte Fox, and Ann
.lx'aliehniaii, freshmen, are now ﬂash-
ing Pi Alpha Tau pins. Sigma Alpha
is telling Dorothy Huntington and
Ruth Kcrley, freshmen, what their
pledge duties are.

AEPhi did their good turn for the
year by holding a. party for twelve
children whose families are on relief.
(iﬂlllOS, refreshments, and favors were
the features of the party.

Leora (icddes, ’34, came back to
visit the l’si Gaminas, and Doris Bell,
’35, was a weekender at Phi Lambda.

Cupid brought us news this week
of Marie Strei’vatcr’s marriage to
Michael Dawson (Psi (lam was Cupid
in this case). Sigma Alpha an~
nounccs the engagement of Mildred
Younger, '34, to llalscy
Dickinson.

Keep gamboliug, girls.

Coach Goewey Plans to Build
Basketball Tradition for State

“()ne of my chief aims will be to
build a basketball tradition at State
college,” stated ('oach (iocwcy at a
rccciit interview. “lty a basketball
tradition,” he went on, “i mean that.
Statc should build up a reputation for
having a strong basketball team, just
as other colleges build up i'cpiitations
for having strong football teams.”

('oach (locwcy plans to build up the
tradition by means oi" two methods:
(I) by :iw'akciiiiig a stronger interest
