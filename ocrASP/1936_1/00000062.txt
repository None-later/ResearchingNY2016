STATE COLLEGE NEWS, MARCH 13, 1936

 

N. Y. Legislature
To Consider Bill
For A $50 Tuition

(Continued from page 1, column 5)

other student shall be paid into the
general fund of the state treasury in

e and manner prescribed by sec-
tion thirty-seven of the state ﬁnance
law.”

“This act shall take effect July
first, nineteen hundred thirty-six.”

This bill has been referred to the
Ways and Means committee, and will
probably be before the Assembly for
action within the next week, since it
constitutes a vital part of the Re-
publican budget revision.

The bill is very much in disfavor
with Dean Nelson and State college
authorities. Prevalent student opin-
ion is likewise adverse to the passage
of the bill. As was stated by Dr.
Nelson, the fee is “very high” and
“would make it'very diﬁicult” for
many deserving students to attend
the college. Supporting the above
opinions, students who will be aﬁected
by this bill should contact their legis-
lators, and endeavor to secure its
defeat.

G.A.A. F LASHES

 

 

 

The seniors are sitting high, high
on a hilltop after their 25 to 23 vic-
tory over the sophomores in the has-
ketball game which was fought on the
Page hall court last Friday. The
seniors seemed to slump at ﬁrst, but
some fast, brilliant plays on the part
of the forwards brought the team up
with a rush. The sophomores played
gallantly, and the score was a toss-up
to the end of the game.

Last week saw some G.A.A. lassies
frolicking around with the famous
tumblers. Perhaps we can look for-
ward to some tumbling acts between
the halves of our games in the future.

Rumor has it that a very unusual
basketball game will be featured in
the athletic contests which close the
winter sports season on March 28.

All of which reminds us that
Alumnae week-end is coming up in
two weeks. We’re hoping to have
a huge crowd and plenty of enter-
tainment. By way of prophecy, it’s
never stormy weather when good

effect September 1, 1936.”

Regarding the motion to make
every sixth assembly a business meet-
ing, Thomas Mcehan, ’37, who intro~
duccd the resolution, has made the
following statement:

“An intelligent discussion is
essential to suﬂ‘icient understanding
of the average controversial issue
raised in student assemblies. By de-
voting evcry sixth assembly entirely
to student affairs we have time for
such discussion, understanding, and
voting, and the ‘railroading’ of
measures will be prevented.”

The text of the amendment to the
By-Laws reads: “Resolved: That
every sixth assembly be constituted

. a business meeting of the student

association assembly and be used for
the discussion of student alfalrs
alone.”
