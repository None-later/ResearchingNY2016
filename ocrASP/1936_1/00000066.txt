smoking Camels eases tension—stimulates digestion— ~'
. and fOsters a feeling of well-being!

Again and again, we make up for lost
time by eating in a hurry. Digestion
must meet the strain. How fortunate
that smoking Camels during and after
meals deﬁnitely stimulates digestion
and helps to ward of the effects of
our hurried, nerve-wrecking life—by
aiding and restoring the natural ﬂow
of the digestive ﬂuids. Today, Camels
are being everywhere recognized as

 “53s.;

a healthful part of the m of dining.

Camels are incomparably mild—
never get on your nerves or tire your"
taste. Enjoy Camels with meals and
the whole day through, for their
matchless blend of costlier tobaccos
—for their energizing "lift"— for the
welcome feeling of well-being they
bring you.

Camels set you right!
