STATE COLLEGE NEWS, MARCH 20, 1936

   

 

Teachers Humble
Hartwick, 40-22

Team Shows Best Form of Year
In Third Consecutive Win;
Bancroft Is Star

 

 

The State college basketball team
closed their 1935—36 season last
Saturday on the Page hall court with
a victory over Hartwick college from
Oneonta. The win, 40—22, boosted
the Purple and Gold consecutive vie-
tories to three and gave tlieu eight
wins and nine loses for the season.

The first State score was on an
out-of-bounds play in which Welter,
on a pass from Amyot, registered
two points. The' Purple and (told,
in the next ten minutes, played their
best ball game for the season and
proved that the team had greatness

that. never before has been shown
for such an extended period. Al-
though the State basketeers were

not robots, they seemed to do every-
thing right at all times. The spec-
tat'ors knew that they were witness-
ing a game in which one team was al-
most totally outclassed. The rooters
began to speculate on the score that
State would run up before the iinnl
whistle. Although all men Sl‘tll'l'tl
in the rally, Welter was credited with
six points mid Bancroft with live (if
the State eighteen points while llai't-
wick had to be content with a single
point.

The game slowed materially from
here on, due to the llllllllii-l‘ ot' fouls

conniiittcd. The State machine was
not a merciless monster but was
contented with a victory; so the

Purple and (lold began to play tlic
rowdy game along with llariwick.
As the liiilf dragged to a close, liaii-
croft scored six more points for State
so that the ’l'caelicrs had ill) and
llart'wici 9 at half time.

The second half
cleaner play was ll()ili"tliilt'. slow
and uninteresting. The original
State team was gradually replaced
by substitutes after they ran llll‘
score to 35 while llai'twick had
reached the id point lcvel. llartwick
in the last ten minutes of play scored
nine points while Stale loafed along
with five points. With a iiiiiiiilc to
go, Len \Vclter completed lis career
as the State center with a long side

was, although

court sliol, that never touched the
rim, for his tlnal two points. The
liiiiil score was State 40 and Hart-
wick 2:2.

("aptain George Bancroft again

was high scorer for State with six-
teen points while Ransom and Smith
each had five for llartwick. The
llartivick players who dominated the
play iit Oneonta were not only
stopped, but the entire team had
only four successful lield shots while

the State starting line—up was play-
ing. That is good defense work on

any ball court. if the team had had
the inspiration and determination all
season that was evident in this game.
many of the dcfcats sull'cri-d this
year would have bccn victories. The
players had more than ii victory pur-
pose for this game; so perhaps this
explains why it was in this, tlic lasl
gaiiic, tlnit the team really "found"
what it could do.

In lhc preliminary game, the
l-‘rcslinicii iigiiiii dropped a close
game, L‘ti—L‘L’. 'l‘lic l'Iastiiiiiii lliisincss

I seem saors

 

 

Well, it’s all over. The season,
we mean. And a good thing it is.

All in all, it wasn’t such a bad
year. True, our win-lose percentage
looks like the North-South score
Just after the Battle of Vicksburg.
But it was a tough trail, and we
came along fairly well.

There are a few vivid recollec-
tions, engraved ou‘wliat we slight-
iiigly refer to as our b'aiii, that
seem to sum up the season. To wit:

A smooth clicking State offense
piling up a long lead over Niagara
in the ﬁrst half, only to blow it all
away after Captain Bancroft limped
to the bench.

Jerry Ainyot coming back in the
St. Michael‘s game iil'te‘ a longr lay
off ainl tlippiiig in several juicy
shots with that inspired port paw.
Always a smooth lnill-liandler,
Aniyot's ilcl‘t juggling made the
\\'iiiooski guards think they were
trailing Houdini. who had ’l‘hurston
helping to cover his trail.

The third and last episode in our
brief series stars G. Bancroft, of
the Johnson City Bancrofts. We
refer to the Queens U. spectacle,
when Skipper George hobbled out
in the second half and. by the
grandest exhibition of raw courage
and smooth skill ever seen on the
Page hall arena. lifted his team from
10 points behind to 2 points ahead.
State finally lost that game. But
Bancroft didn’t. He won.

And so farewell.

Freshmen Defeat
Sophomore Rivals

Green and White Leaps Forward
To Lead Class Rivalry
By 8 Points To 51/;

 

The freshmen swamped their tra-
ditional rivals in the annual fresh-
man-sophomore basketball game Mon-
day night, .‘iU—lti. For the first half
and a few minutes of the third quar-
for, it was a nip mid tuck battll;
but at this point, with the score 14—
13 in their favor, the fresh forged
ahead to a lead that was never
threatened. The victory meant three
rivalry points for the class of ’39
mid gave them a lead of eight to
live alid one-half points in rivalry
competition to date.

The teams stalked each other for
the first period, feeling out each
othcr’s style of attack. Between
stalkings, 'l‘rehanon and Schmitz
sank doublc dcckers for the blue
and Qiiattroclii countered with a licld
basket for the fresh, ending the quar-
lcr with the score 4—2 in favor of the

soplis.
ill the second quarter, the lads
opened up a bit. (Qiiat'trochi sank

his second field basket of the game.
Ryan scored on a pass from Miranda
mid Schmitz added a foul point.
’l'orrciis, Lehman, and Qualtroclii
connected in succession on free
throws. With five minutes of the
half left, Aiiiyot scored on ii nicc
sidccourt' shot which Ryan matched
with a lay-up. Hosiey converted on
a gift throw, Miranda scorcd on a
follow-up, and Aiiiyot looped iii an»
other long one to end the scoring for
the half. Score: frosli 12: soplis ii.

The soplis were still in the game.
'l‘rchanoii made good a free throw.

(,luallrochi took his own foul try
on the rebound and looped it in.
Schmitz halved the frosh margin,
bringing the score to lil~l4, when
he sank one from the black line.
Then the grccn»c|ai| balllcrs really
went to town. (in a foul shot by

Lehman, and field baskets by Lch-
maii. llcrsliliowitz. aiiil .\luggleloii,
they ran the score up to Bililil dur-
ing this cliukkcr.

The yciii'liiigs never hesitated. 'l‘or-
rcns scored from the field. Wasser-
man added a point for the blue
hanger-uppers. Lehman scored on a
pass from Aniyot. Walko converted
one and liukc two gift tosses. Dukc
again. with a lay-up and a foul toss
making the fresh total 30. Miranda
ended the scoring with ii beautiful
long shot.

l“t)l' the losers, Miranda was oul-
standing on both defense and offense.
Qinittroclii was “hot” oll’cnsivcly
for the youngsters, \vliilc llersliko-
wil7. dominated the fresh play while
he was in the game. The fresh sped
up their playing speed niorc intelli-
gently and employed their reserve
sti‘cngtli to advantage, while their
superiors fought doggedly but \vorc
lliciiisclvcs out. it was a well-played
gaiiic llllli an intensely interesting
one to the frenzied siipportcrs of
the two aggregations.

The preliminary was just like old
limos. Remember ilie rivalry game

heated discussion of debatable points.

Rivalry Debate,
Student Motions
To Be in Assembly

((‘oiiliiinrrl from page I. column (7)

The second resolution is an iiincnd-
ment to the liy-Laws of the student
association providing that one assem-
bly in every six lic solely used as a
business meeting. It reads: “Re
solved: That every sixlli assembly be
constituted a business meeting of the
student association assembly and be
used for the discussion of student
affairs alone.”

The liiiiil order of business is a reso-
lution which would place the student
body as dcliiiilely opposed to the pro-
posed $50.00 a year tuition bill now
before the state legislature. it far-
llier provides i‘illll the student body
send delegates to speak against the
bill at public hearings, that the. state
normal schools and liull’iilo State
Teachers college be asked to pass
similar resolutions, and that the stu-
dcat association print protest cards
which each student may mail to mem-
bers of the legislature.

The text of the resolution is:

“WHEREAS, There has been in-
lroduced and there is now pending in
the legislature a bill known as the
.\lol'fat bill which would impose a
$50le yearly tuition fee on all sin-
dciils of State Normal schools and
