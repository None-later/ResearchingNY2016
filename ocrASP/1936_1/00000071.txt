Students For 3.8. In Commerce
Must Choose One Curriculum
For Specialization

Due to a revision in the counnerce
curriculum taking eﬁect next Septem-
ber, all those desiring a degree of
Bachelor of Science in Commerce will
be required to specialize in one of
three ﬁelds, according to Dr. Milton
G. Nelson, dean. These ﬁelds are:
(1) general commercial, (2) secre-
tarial, (3) accounting.

Concerning the revision, Dean Nel’
son made the following statement:
“The 1936—1937 issue of the State
college catalog presents a complete
revision of the requirements for a
Bachelor of Science degree in Com-
merce. The commerce curriculum of-
fered will enable students of State
college to meet the requirements which
the State of New York has estab-
lished for certification of a teacher in
this ﬁeld. it is probable that these
requirements will apply to the present,

freshman, soplnnnore, and junior
classes.”

This revision, therefore, will apply
to all classes, except the present

senior class. However, the curriculum
has been so arranged that even those
juniors working in the commerce ﬁeld
will be able to arrange their schedule
to meet the requirements.

The three curricula in commerce
are to be considered as separate fields.
A person holding a license to teach in
one commercial ﬁeld may teach only
in that ﬁeld, and not in either of the
other two commercial lields.

Beginning next September, all
freshmen, in addition to six hours ot’
freshman English, must take six morc
hours of English in their sophomore,
junior, or senior years. The alterna-
tive requirement of six hours of a
foreign language has been omitted.

The catalog containing the detailed
descriptions of these revisions will be
ready for distribution soon.

Dr. Thompson Has Novel Authority
"To Make Literature Anywhere”

“Most ample power to read, teach,
and make literature anywhere in the
world”, (‘ ‘ amplissimam potcstatem
Litteras ubiquc gentium legendi
doccndi facicndi concessam”), is the
broad authority granted to Dr. Harold
W. Thompson, professor of English,
by his degree of Doctor of Letters
from the University of Edinburgh.

This interesting Latin manuscript.
carries with it more unique distinc-
tions than merely being able “to
make Literature” at any time, at
any place the holder of it may wish.
The Doctor of Letters “sheepskin”
entitles Dr. Thompson to vote in
Scottish elections for a member of
the English Parliament to represent
the University of Edinburgh, although
he is a native born American citizen.
He has never exercised his franchise
privilege in Scotland.

As a result of his earning this
rarely bestowed doctorate, Dr.
Thompson is a member of the Coun-
cil of the University of lildinburgh.
in 1929, this foremost university of
Scotland awarded Dr. 'l‘hompson the
Doctor of Letters degree, which is
beyond a lloctor of Philosophy (the
highest degree otl’crcd in the United
States at the present time). The
D. Litt. degree is very seldom given,
and when the occasion docs occur,
it is conferred only upon scholars of
literature or historians. One can
realize fully the scarcity of them
when he knows that Dr. 'l‘bompsou
is the only American to be so singu-
larly honored and is one out of
thirty-three people in the world to
hold the doctorate.

Dr. 'l‘hompson studied in Scotland

and England from “125—1927 for
his 1). Litt. degree. While doing
his research work for his book on-

titled “A Scottish Man of Fooling”.
a history of Scotland in the Golden
Age of Burns and Hcolt, 'llr. 'l‘homp-
son uncovcrwl a mach scorched-tor
manuscript of llcnry Mackenzie
(1745—1831), one of the foremost
authors of his tinn-. It seems that

 

Mackenzie left to Sir Walter Scott
in his will a document, “Anecdotes
and Egotisms”. Before Scott could
publish it, he died and the valuable
articles of Mackenzie were mis-
placed. After being carried to India
and then back to London, the “Ance-
dotes and Egotisms” were discovered
finally by Dr. Thompson whose in-
tensive search was rewarded after
four months of work.

Dr. Thompson has been honored
by membership in several of Scot-
land’s learned societies. lie is a
“Fellow of the Royal Society of
Edinburgh” (F.R.S.E.), which has
for its leading hereditary members
the King of England and the Prince
of Wales. Benjamin Franklin was
the ﬁrst American to become a mem—
ber of this society. Dr. Thompson is
also a “Fellow of the Society of An-
tiquarians of Scotland (F.S.A.S.)”,
and a member of the “Scottish His-
tory Society”, which is similar to
the American historical association.

“LION” OFFERS PRIZE

The State Lion is. sponsoring a
“wisecrack contest” for the coming
issue, the winner of which will net
one carton of assorted Life Savers,
according to John Murphy, ’37, busi-
ness manager. Entries, which must
be original, should be in the editors’
hands by Wednesday.
