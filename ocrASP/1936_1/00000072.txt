’38 Soiree Sign Returns
After Visiting Freshmen
O t) and no! The sophomores
can't even spell their own name.
At. least they omitted an “o”
from their Soiree sign which hung
over the Draper hall stairs. Notice
the word “hung”—not “hangs”.
Rut thereby hangs a tale.
it seems that the freshmen in
order to spare their rivals some

undue enrlarrrassnient (it, did
away with the sign. It was gone
for about a week. The sopho-

mores queried. worried, and held
frequent consultations. And now
—from a “fresh” source of irr-
formation, we learn that the sign
has been returned to the sopho-
mores. However it has not re-
tirrncd to its former position.
