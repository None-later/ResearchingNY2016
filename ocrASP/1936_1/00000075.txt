UALITIBS OF A TRUE EDUCAv

TION were outlined by President
Roosevelt following his recei t of a Doctor
of Jurisprudence degree rom Temple
University. 'Said the President: “First
among these attributed is a sense of fair
play among men . . . The second great
attribute of education is . . . a sense of
equality among men when they are dealing
with the things of the mind . . . Finally.

the college walls no convent walls. Though she pre’

saw to it that Latin was abandoned to make room for
pressing current educational matters. In New York

realistically kept pace with the times, without com!

strong a ection from those whose tastes and instincts
are sound.
