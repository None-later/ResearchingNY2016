Sophomores Win
Intro-mural Title

Juniors Taste Defeat At Hands
Rivals After Severe
Closing Handicap

 

The intro-mural basketball series
was concluded last Thursday on the
Page hall court when the league
championship playoff between the
uJuniors, first half? winners, and the
Sophomores, second half winners, saw
the Soplis win possession of the league
.cup. The final score, 38 to 25, (lacs
not indicate the hotly contested close
battle put up by the two teams until
'the Juniors were forced to play the
ﬁnal ﬁve minutes with four men when
Edward Hulilian, a guard, was forced
to leave the game due to a back iii-
jury.

'I‘rehanon opened the scoring when
he sank a short shot, but the Juniors
ran their score to six before the
Sophs could score again. At the end
of the quarter, the second year men
had a four point advantage, 10 to ti.
Midway in the second quarter, Ed
Warren, ’37, knotted the score for
the last time on a gift shot, but Patsy
Miranda sank a mid-court and a cor-
ner shot to give the ’38ers a lead that
was never again overcome by the
.Juniors. At half time the Sopho-
mores had 19 points while the Juniors
had 16.

The third quarter saw the blue
warriors go eight points up on the
Juniors, 25—17, before the last chal-
lenge was put forth by the lied Raid-
vers that gave them ‘21 points to the
Blue Buccaneers’ 25. Early in the
final quarter, Roy Swiiigle garnered
two points on an out of botlnds play
to cut the Soph lend to two points.
Miranda again came through in the
“clutch” on‘a free throw and a side
court shot to give the Buccaneers ‘18.
It was at this stage of the game. livc
minutes to go to the final whistle, that
Ed Hulilian was injured. lie at-
tempted to play, since there were no
replacements for the .liiiiioi‘s. but was
forced to withdraw a play or two
later. The Juniors made a valiant
attempt to “cover” the Sophs with
their four men, but the second year

men would shake a man loose to scoi'c..
dc ,

'l‘lic Juniors were on a constant

fense with an occasional long shot al'

the has et. Charlie .\lorris sank one
from mid-court for the final Junior
score. Meanwhile the Sopbs ran up
ten points in these five minutes. The
payoff score was its for the Nopho
mores and 2:3 for the .liuiiors.

Patsy Miranda stood out for the
Sophomores with thirteen points for
the offense and a bangiip defense
gainc. Although Al lln Mont was a
marked man, he led the Juniors with
nine points. The Sophomore victory
gives them the honor of being the
first class to have their numerals cii-
graved on the new intrii-miii'al chain

In the ])l‘L‘llll|lll:ll’\' pick-up game
the “Seniors” defeated the “ l"i'osh”
in one overtime period. 4': to its.

day basketball interest had

. track has again reared its head,
but: alas it will be confined to locker
room word description as usual . . .
llardmeyer will not have to worry
about his weight this year when he
again takes up his racket (tennis)
because teaching has brought his
avoii'diipois down to playing weight
. . . tennis has taken on a new order
of things for the better.

The freshmen have a new basket-
ball star center, a lad named Welter
who materially aided them in a
Victory over a high school in Cats-
kill last Saturday . . . from all re-
ports, he is the exact “double” of
Len Welter, ’36, the varsity center
of the Purple and Gold for the past
season . . . I wonder? . . . the intra-
mural did not send up a Margison
or a Welter this year, but, unless
an entering freshman is discovered,
Al DuMont will move up from the
junior star to varsity center job.

. Intro-mural Head

Announces Spring
Season’s Program

A panorama of seasonal sporting
events, cliinnxed by in mid-May inter-
class track meet, will make up the
spring intra-mural calendar, splat-
tered Thomas Barrington, ’37, presi-
dent of the intra-mural association,
from a for corner of the shower room.
“Infra-mural sports are open to all
iiicu of the college, and all men are
urged to participate,” liarrington
said.

To be continued is the swimming
group on Monday, Wednesday, and
Thursday alr'ternoons from 3:30 to
5:00 o’clock, to which all mermen, in
even greater numbers, are invited to
come and splash around. Bowlers
and prospective bowlers can have their
flirt Thursday nights at 7:30 o’clock
on the Y.M.II.A. alleys. Volley ball
may be played on Saturday after-
noons in the Page hall gym. Ping-
pong can be played airy time; the
tournament has reached the quarter-
final round.

l'iitei‘-class softball will begin ini-
incdiately after the Easter recess, or
even before, the condition of the field
permitting. With the opening of the
tennis courts, a tournament will swing
into action, the. winner of which will

receive a handsome trophy. An inter—
class track and fiehl meet will be
conducted about Moving-up Day. if

there is a great enough demand for it,
horseshoe pitching may be introduced
into the iiiti'ii—iiini'al program.

Committee May
Not Report Bill

The Ways and Means committee
of' the New York State Assembly will
in all probability not report oiil of
committee the .\lofl'.'itl bill which calls
for a $50 tuition fee for all students
of Htiitc schools of higher learning.
This information was made public
in a statement to a Man‘s reporter
by Assemblyman Abbot Low .\loil'atl,
cliaii'iiiiiii of' the Ways and Means
coiiiniillcc.

The bill was a part of the revision
program of' the Republican Assembly
for the (iovernor’s budget, and would
have rcplnccd a portion of the exist-
ing gasoline tax.

Statewide criticism of this bill
from bolli students and other sources
has been evidenced to a grcnt extent
since the llitrodllclioii of the bill
several weeks- ago, This statement
comes as reasonably positivi- (’(ill'
lii'matioii that the bill will iiol be
acted upon in the Assembly.

G.A.A. F LASHES

Sing a song of baseball bats, of
volley balls, and spring. With the
winter season winding up with a big
bang in Alumnae week-end, we are
all looking forward to spring sports.
The games tomorrow are guaranteed
to be spectacular, stupendous, thrill-
ing—«in other words, worth seeing.

Time will turn back in its flight
it is rumored. We shrill be treated
to a basketball game as our Aunt
Minnie played it. Fashion shows
seem to be popular, and the athletic
costumes of the young ladies will
offer a striking contrast between the
old and the new.

The dinner tomorrow night
promises something rare in the way
ot‘ food and entertainment. Several
former champion hockey and basket-
ball stars have promised to add
their bit to the festive occasion.

The Seniors are the favorities in
the inter-class tournament. 'l‘heii'
crushing victory over the fresh last
Friday may better be left unmen-
tioiied for fear of giving the young-
sters an inferiority complex. ”l‘is
said the winning team will receive
a new award which will become an
A.A. tradition. All the classes have

 

 

 

shown a fine, hard-working and
sporting spirit in the gaiiies—the
same spirit which will make the

events tomorrow a jolly conclusion to
.‘l successful season.

Baseball “Season 
T° 

Coach .Goewey To Begin Training,
State Nine For Schedule;
Amyot Is Captain

 

With the close of the basketball
season, athletics at State turn to
baseball with only three school weeks
intervening before the ﬁrst game of
the season. This game is scheduled
with hard college on Saturday, April
25. Gerald Ainyot, ’36, will captain
this year’s varsity and will take his
stand at ﬁrst base.

This year the baseball varsity will
be the first to use the new athletic
field at the Alumni Residence hall.
Preparations are being made to im-
prove the surface of the ﬁeld and
lines will be made for the construc-
tion of a diamond in the near future.
The use of this ﬁeld will be a step
forward in centralizing the athletics
at State college, and will result in
greater student interest in the out-
door sports. in the opinion of Coach
Gocwey.

(‘oacli Gocwey points out the fact
that the gym is not ideal for indoor
practice because none of the condi-
tions are similar to the actual dia-
mood. The hard floor, the lighting,
and the atmospheric conditions will,
it' they do anything, retard rather
than enhance the efficiency of the reg-
nlars and rookies when outdoor prac-
tice is called. The only possible
workout would be tossing the ball at
a distance that is inadequate on the
diamond. No player with natural
ability needs practice in the art of
pilcli and catch when he reaches col-
lege level for the game. if practice
were held, the ﬁrst week outdoors
would produce innumerable sore arms
and the possibility of a season dis-
ability. llased on this, the practice
would not warrant the results.

On the other liainl, if the campus
on Washington avennc dries out rap-
idly, tlic conch intends to have prac-
tice outdoors. The battery candidates
will then be allowed to “nurse” their
arms into shape for the opening game
the first week after the Easter vaca-
tion. The other players will have
some batting and fielding practice on
a iiiiiiiaturc scale, but the coach will
give his attention to the battery can-
didiitcs.

All candidates for monkey suits
(baseball iniiforiiis) should see the
coach this week so that he may have
a tentative knowledge of what size
and quality the squad will be when
it steps out on the new field in a
few weeks.

RECALLS DEADLINE
in pursuance of By-Law 7 of the
student association, the Point System
Revision committee wishes to remind
all student organizations that elec-
tions and appointments for the coni-
ing year. including revotcs, must be

complete by ’l‘hin'sday, April 30.
