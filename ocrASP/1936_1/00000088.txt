The Point System Revision com-
mittee will present its report in the
11:10 o’clock assembly this morning.
'This report will list the new point
ratings and also attendant resolutions
pertinent to the maintenance of the
new ratings. The method of the com-
pilation of the point ratings and the
listing of them follow.

From the statement of hours of
work and duties handed the commit-
tee, a list of activities was compiled
ranking positions of executive resporr
:sibility as A, associate major oiliccs
as B, and minor olt‘lces as C. The
number of hours per semester for each
ofﬁce was then multiplied to take -arc
of prestige and responsibility, as
follows:

Semester hours of A olilee x 1.50
Semester hours of Ii olilcc x 1.25
Semester hours of C office it 1.00

The result was called classification
.hours, or C. l'l.’s. The C. l'l.’s of all
the statements were ranked in statis»
.tical form. From this the median
point of all the cases was found and
the deciles were. also arrived at on the
basis of a formula similar lo the sta-
tistical formula used for finding the
median. These deciles, hitherto re»
ferred to as Md. l).’s, were placed in
order. The arithmetic mean or siln~
pic average of all the cases ot‘ l‘. ii. ’s
was then found by the estimate
linetllod. From this arithmetic mean,
figures corresponding to deciles were
reached by extension oi" lhc ul'ilhmclic
mean multiplied by two. (The arith-
lactic mean was taken to be the 50%
or average point.) The averages thus
obtained were termed Arithmetic
Mean Dcciles or A. .\i. D.'s. Thcse
A. M. D.’s were tabulated in proper
form opposite the‘hld. l).’s to which
they corresponded. The .\[d. D. ’s and
their corresponding A. .\1. Us were
then averaged, with the former being
weighted at three, and the latter at
two. This end result thus achieved
was a set of ﬁgures known as Classiﬁ-
cation Dccilcs or C. D.’s. which ﬁx
the limits in classiﬁcation hours of
each point in the point system. Thus
the point system lll terms ol' classiﬁ-
cation hours is:

O _ I _ O
Rivalry Court Tilt

Thursday, arch 26, on the Page
hall court, several lithe lads, repre-
senting the Edward Eldred Potter
club, defeated several equally agile
artists wearing the colors of Kappa
Delta Rho fraternity in a hectic
basketball game'by a score of 41-29.

The victory was something in the
nature of an upset; but close fol-
lowers of the sport had considered
the outcome of the game a toss-up.
Each fraternity now has one game to
its credit ill the two years of oiiicial
play.

The black and white (Potter Club)
were explosively incipient, running
the score up to 18—12 at the end of
the iirst half.

Then KDR came to life tempo-
rarily. Bancroft converted a free
throw. O’l-lora puslled one in.
.\lnggleton and .Rodem'ys rang the
bell' successively on follow-ups.
O’i—Iora added two nlore points and
Mal-gison one for the Ontario strcct
ogrcs. Bancroft from the ﬂuid,
iloran from the foul line, and
Byrncs once and Bancroft twiec from
the other foul line.

Mnrgison tossed in a gift throw.

It seems that I wandered in vain
last week about the frosh center . . .
my source of info (not a local
paper) said that he was mistaken
. . . I was on the spot all week as
a result . . . the. center was Mike
Waiko, a tried and true frosh . . .
My face is still red and so it should
he . . . Am I forgiven??? .

I see that three men in State are
wearing silver buksthails as a re-
sult of a tournament held in Troy
. . . Congratulations and all that . . .
D.H. got the most valuable player
award as an added something . . .

Some of the men say that track
is to be more than mere talk and
an intramural meet this year . . .
swcllngcnt. If the time trials for
the meet are average, there is hope
ill the hearts of some. of the pant-
punt boys of outside competition
. . . will this lead to another varsity
spring- sporti'l we need it but will
we pct what we wallt‘l'l'! we’ll have
500 men here within three years so
we should prcparc a sport outlet for
this inilux of men here is a
chance for .\i..-\..-\. to do some con»
structivc building bnt they need an
increased budget: . . . coming events
cast l'orih ihcir something and all
lhal . . . hero is a chance to get thc
jump on the shadow . . .

A few of the lads are coming to
classes a bit hot under the collar
due to the gentle art of sidewalk
tennis . . . ping pong is losing its
hold on some of the sturdier of our
athletes as a result . . . a tourna-
lncnt is what is needed to settle the
who’s who in ranking . . .

The break ill relations with a cer-
tain collcgc hccause of the basket-
ball squabble has become oilicial.
It is rumored that the grounds that
they had for ondin;_r it were crro
ncous. So that cl‘nscs a game or
two from the baseball schedule . . .
it hurts to soc the wins go oil' the
slate . . . |l.l’.l. is going:r to try to
give our nine in heating or two this
year In a few years maybe
we'll have a Union . . . Are we forg-
ing ahead to the big time . . . Ya.
man . . .

It seems that the men have to be
told to keep off the campus . . . Why
can’t they wait until after Easter
like the rest of us and then all of
us can enjoy a nice campus . . . It’s
a shame that a few inconsiderates
cause all of us to get a tongue
lashing . . .
