 

y STATE COLLEGE newsnrmn 3, 1936:

 

  

 

 

The alums, have come and gone,
, and springsports are upon us. In
the game lastSaturday the alumnae
showed, some ﬁght in the beginning
but their mind gave out, and the
score climbed high in favor of the
undergraduates. The costumes in the
comedy game were more original
than stylish. The tumbling act was
well done for a ﬁrst attempt. We
feel for those who were on the
bottom of the tumble down pyramid.
Perhaps next year, G. A- A will
sponsor a regular tumbling team.
The silver loving cup presented to
the senior team for winning the
inter-class basketball tournament is
_ a. thing of beauty—it may be a joy
forever if Lib Hobbie doesn’t use
it for an ash tray. The sophomores
were the closest scorers to the
seniors. They had a. total of 160
points against the yellow team’s 208.
The seniors won six games and lost
none, while the sophomores won three,
lost two and tied one.
