45 Fanned in 36 Innings

TO SPEAK of University of Chicago athletics is to
speak of heroes rather than of teams. Currently it
is jay Berwanger in football, Bill Haarlow in basket
ball. On two successive afternoons in the sprin of
[931 it was Roy Henshaw, short and slight pr uct
of Chicago sandlots. Roy took the. mound for the
' University of Chicago baser
ball team against Minnc'
sets and polished off the
Gophers in a , double
header; the next day the
team was lndiana, likewise
polished off by Chicago in
two games in one afterr
noon. The record books
showed that Pitcher Hen-
shaw had fanned 45 men

lll those 36 innings.
This Was really worth
» setting down, but for Roy
 *' 4 Henshaw the two after'
noons were almost lackadaisical. He had always
fanned out batters with the greatest of  for three
years with Chicago. One season it was 92; and that

same season he averaged five hits a game.

Such Big Ten splendor could not long pass not
noticed by the Chicago Cubs. In 1932; Roy left col!
lege to try out with that noisy and periodically bril»
liant club. His college education having been satis’
factory on the diamond, Roy gradually row to lustre
as a Big Leaguer. This year the excel egian may be
named in a breath with the dizzicst of Deans himself.

‘ “Bah” to Athlete’s Heart

ASCIENTIFIC question that has a bearing on the

case of Roy Henshaw. and those of a thousand
others named in college athletic books. has been
settled. in a measure. by Dr. William G. Leainon of the
University of Pennsylvania. To the query: What
about athlete‘s heart? Dr. Leamon. in medical terms
replied: nothing. The. terms: heart'strain is not pot"
sible in a healthy heart; participation in athletics does
not predispose to early development of a cardiovas
cular disease. Dr. Learnon‘a conclusion has been sup'
united by Boston scientists and with proof that col'
ege athletes live longer than average men.
