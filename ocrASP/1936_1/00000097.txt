HE Drs. Joseph B. Heidler and Harvey CL Lehman

of Ohio University (Athens. Ohio) have not yet
attained the stature which would include them in the
current Who's Who with their less active fellow
citizens. but they have been briskly engaged in a work
that has not been without national recognition. N0
WPA research men, they reported their findings to
the American Association for the Advancement of

1-  Science some time ago.

' Dr. Heidler is an assor
ciate professor of English
it Ohio, while his colv
league, Dr. Lehman, is a
professor of psychology.
Their field. roughly. was
the age of productivity of
literary men. The results.
of more value to psychol‘
ogy than literature, may
be brieﬂy summarized as
fOIIOWs: the creative writer
would do well, the studs

D" ”"““"' tics say. to start creative
writing before he is 4; years of age. That age has
been an average of sound prolificness among I.670
British. American. French and German authors. the
irofessors' have found. The poets say their most

fore the age of 30; biographers are at their best in
the sixties; historians, critics and philosophers in their
fifties: scientific. political and educational writers, and
satirists, in their forties. .: .. r .
The oldster turning out

necessarily a senile pva
titioner in literature, the
report says. Such a one.
figures show. has cont
batted a fact of old ag-:
change of interest and loss
