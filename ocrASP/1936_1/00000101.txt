FROM THE BENCH

 

 

 

At: last we are outdoors . . . I mean
the ball team . . . Monday saw the
largest squad that ever answered a
coach’s trot out at Ridgeficld . . .
they were as thick (in number) as
flies on a piece of candy . . . the
batters could not get a ground ball
out. of the infield because, it‘ it was
not. fielded, the. anatomy of some iii-
spired lad stopped it . . . the weather
is still against us; so the men on the
bill are afraid to let them ride home

Johnny Ryan, the one man out-
field, drags them in no matter what
field they ride to . . . Young looks
like a dapper duo in that red
sweater . . he wants to attract
sonicone’s attention . Lynch is
living up to press agent notices with
his Ruthian wallops . . . he has that
appearance at ye olde plnttore that
pleases one and all. . . . Cullen attd
Rob German are also putting their
drives out on the cinder track . . .
Butcher seems to know his way
around the keystone sack . . he
gets that pill away fast withoul any
apparent ell'ort oti his part, no
stranger at that spot . . .

If you leave out the mound, first
and third base, yeti know the start-
ing line up as well as the next: one

if you locker room—chers would
go out for the tennis team instead
of saying that you can heat some of
the squad members, maybe the team
would be excellent instead of good
. this isa competitive sport so
invitations are extended to you
. you have to prove your worth
. show up or shut up now . .
it’s tip to you . . .

l‘ld Kramer must be trying out
for a ball dodger ,job at a side show
. he ducked those foul flies as
deft as Sally Rand when he was
sharpening tip his shots for R.l’.I.

Why lies Rubin wears tennis
shorts on the wind swept plains of
R-idgciicld at this time of year is a
mystery to me . . . Bill Baker says
we have another tennis match for
the taking . . . it seems tlnit Some of
our leading actors will be missing
for the Moving-Up day plays because
of the tennis schedule . . .

Well, prediction time is here again.
We’ll go out on the limb with this
one; our lads, we don’t know who
they are yet, will come olit on top
by two rims in a loosely played con-
test . . .'l‘hcrc it is . . . PLAY HAW"
WUL.

siding at 397 State Street, but after ,
