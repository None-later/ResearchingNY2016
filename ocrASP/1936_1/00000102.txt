Reporter Tells Story of

Unﬁnished Library Mural :

The college ‘studes’ who invade
the library are asking, ‘ ‘What is

the white painted panel in the

center of the north wall? Is it
another part of the mural?”

After due investigation by the
inquiring reporter, it seems that
the door, which always provided
an observatory location for talk-
ative students, has been removed.
The white sear is the only re-
maining vestige of its former
existence.

But—and this is important—
starting June ﬁrst, the mural will
be continued, not only on that
wall, but on the other walls of the
library.

Someone says that these will
create an atmosphere more (3011-
ducivc to study. . . .

 

 

...she knows
