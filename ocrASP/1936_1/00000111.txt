STATE COLLEGE NEWS, MAY 1, 1936

Future Corpses, Veterans, Mata Haris From State
Mobilize Forces and Ideas Through Satirical Verse

Tune: ‘ ‘ Mademoiselle fromArmcn-
tieres ”

“We are the youthful veterans of
future wars,

It seems that some day we must ﬁght
on foreign shores,

Before we vote to take a chance

We want our bonus in advance,

Veterans of future wars.”

This ditty, imported from other
higher institutions of learning at last
week-ends debate conference at Buf-
falo is indicative of the satirical way
in which college youth has begun to
treat war. Ingenuity is not dead,
either, for in our own college halls
there have been recent brainstorms
for peace.

Some of State College maidens,
for instance, have banded together
as the Mata Haris of future wars.
“The membership is small as yet,
but we can’t all be Mata llaris,”
said one of the organizers. The
subcmnmittccs of this organization
include those on Underhand Methods,
Undergronml Passages and Dark
Corners, War Babies, and Prominent
Generals of the Other Side.

Coming back to rhyme, however,
when local fans had got to the fifth
verse of “The Youthful Veterans”
they decided to write some stanzas
for State college. The ﬁfth stanza

differs from the quoted ﬁrst by the
third and fourth lines:

Either the mention of ballyhoo or
bloodshed must have been responsible
for the appearance of these State-
written lines:

“We will teach
future wars,

it seems that smile day they must die
on foreign shores,

Just pity all our poor students,

They’ll never grow up to be ladies
and gents,

Heroes of the future wars.”

the following:
