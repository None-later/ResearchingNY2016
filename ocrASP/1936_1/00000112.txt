Di loma Changes
ffective in 1937

Dr. A. it. lil'tllltll‘llt‘l', president of
the college, announces that some
slight changes will he made in the
diplomas granted to seniors who will
he graduated this June.

The most important revision of
the diploma is the fact that no
teacher miiy teach a suh‘ject in which
he has not received at least eighteen

hours college credit. This will do
away with teaching of many suh-
jects hy inexperienced and unpre-

pared graduates.

Also the diplomas will now state
that the receiver is qualitied to teach
in “secondary schools” in a cer-
taiii suhvject, or certain Hilli'it't'th',
rather tlniii specifying as to whether
he shall teacii the hillilieet in 'junior
or senior high schools,

llr. lli‘uhacher likewise said that
the provisional certilicnte t‘oi' teach-
iilgr will not go into effect with this
senior class. hilt will lie incorporated

in the diplomas ot' the class of IEIJlT.‘
