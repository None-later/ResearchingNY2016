“Two Disabilities And Numerous
Errors Give R.P.I. The Edge
In Second Contest

In a baseball game that saw two
Purple and Gold players forced to
leave the liiienp due to the injuries
they received, the State nine was
turned back in their second game of
the season, last Saturday on the
Ridgelield diamond, when liensselaet
Polytechnic Institute won 11 to 4.
State used two pitchers. (‘ulleu and
Schmitz, to no avail when the men
behind them made costly errors at
the wrong time.

State lost Quattroclii from third
base when he crashed into a fence
post. catching Gledden's lly in the
first inning. llancrot‘t took his place
in the last half of the secoiol inning
when the effects of the contact caused
Frank to have a blurred vision. The
Teachers nuide a bid for a score
the third inning, but on a sacrillce
bout that turned into a fly to the
pitcher, Iil’l erased the threat by
completing a double play to llrst.

ltl’l scored three imeariied rims in
the third on two inlicld errors. a
walk, and a long lly to center lield.

State retrieved two of these in the
fourth, when, after one out, .\m_vot
got the first Httite hit, a single to
centerlield. He stole second and
came home on Lynch 's single, l.ynch
stealing second and third, when at
this stage, ('ullen died to third.
With Schmitz at bat. liynch made a
spectacular steal home that saw an

irresistible force conquer the iin
movable object. The single of
Schniitz ’s went for nought. as Itau

croft grounded out to end the inning.
The 'l'rojans scored four unearned
runs in the fifth by coiiihiiiiiig two

errors, a walk, aml three singles
which should have seen the side go

down one, two, three.

The l‘Ingineers garnered their other
four run rally oll' Scluuity. in the
seventh frame. A home run over the
handball court by Morrow started
this rally. A two base hit, three lilt

batsmen, and a sacrilice thrown in
for good measure added three on
necessary runs to the mass.

in the above rally, l._\'nch was

spiked in the right hand during a
play at the plate. tl‘llricn took his
place behind the plate, and did a
splendid job of calling the pitches.
After two were out in the eighth.
(l’l’urien started the last Slate rally

with a two hagger to center lield.
t'ullcn drove a single to left, and
()‘llrien advanced to third. Heluuit/n
came through with his second hit,
a double to left lield. tluit scored

“Hutchinson for president, Baker
for vice-president, and the White
House in 1936! ” So read the tenth
ballot of the Republicratic presiden-
tial nomination convention, project
of the Government class aml the
brain child of Big liill Bi‘adt, ’38,
party manager.

“Alfalfa” Landon, “llard” Knox,
and “Bill Corn” liorah fell before
these dynamic candidates who were
selected to carry the tottering
elephant (ensign) because of their
profuse governmental knowledge.

A platform of social justice will
support these men iii their campaign
against the Demagogues. Since the
women had a plurality at the con-
vention, the best laid plans of men
went amiss, and the platform was
packed along the following lines:

If elected, the 'andidates promised
to promise anything. But by the
way of example, they promised to

The burg of Squccdnnk opened its
arms as host to the convention. The
mayor, a slightly warped politician,
donated the facilities of the town hall
to the liepublicrats. The local band
composed of two harmonicas, one
trumpet, and a violin, all of doubt-
ful vintage, blew the convention into
town with a dissonant remling of the
“Stars amt Stripes lt‘orcver”. The
soul inspiring convention song was
directed by Miss Eloise Shearer, ’37,
the songbird of the local hills and
the warbler of those same hills.

The convention was progressing
smoothly, when the sherill‘ of Squee-
dtiiik ordered the “——-—” thing to
get out of town before the 6:00
o’clock curfew rang. The reason
for the expulsion was as folltJWs:
Delegates insisted upon tossing their
half emptied liquor bottles through
the town hall's windows and into the
surrounding pastures, thereby alco-

To Show Talent

’37 Favorites To Win Thursday;

The bottle of track talent is being
nncorked with the characteristic
“wlunup”. Lean or burly, man or
mouse, speedster or discobulus, every
ambitious lad is signing up for the
inter-class track meet in the hope
that he has something his class can‘
use. The sophomores, with a wealth
of new and skilled recruits, are ever
advancing themselves as potential
winners. And the juniors, victors

last year, have a ready comeback
for every belittling statement di-
rected at them. The trackstors of

’39 are at present black stallions;
their possibilities will be revealed in
the contest.

The. meet is Thursday, on the
Western avenue campus, at 4:00
o’clock. thinning events include the
lot), 220, 440, half-mile, mile, and
two-mile. Field events are the high
jump, shot put, broad jump, and
discus throw. (‘lass track managers
are lt‘nllngar, Meehnn, Gaylord, and
'l'orrens. Signing up on the bulletin
board near the locker room is the
order of the (lay for prospective
comptditors.

ball schedule has been completed.

The riding group has been taking
advantage of the line weather.

might be a good idea if the ad-
