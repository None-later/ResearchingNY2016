STATE COLLEGE NEWS, MAY 8,

1936

 

F Await Movingvup
And Tapping of New Myskania

Rivals and former rivals—the yclv
low and white, the red and white and
the classes of blue and green—will
join ranks one week from today as
State’s classes move up amidst an
atmosphere of solcnmity and gaicty
and martial music. Moving-up Day,
State’s “grandest tradition,” will
begin again at 8:00 o’clock, after a
heraldry of athletic events and re-
hearsals and guesses the day and
week before.

Directed by Vera Shinncrs, ’36,
grand marshal, 1200 men and women
of State—attired according to class
in caps and gowns, canes and white
ﬂannels and white dresses, jackets,
and bow tics and hair ribbons—will
form lines by classes early in the
morning and proceed to the Page
auditorium.

The Page program will open with
brief addresses by each of the class
speakers, which will be followed by
the presentation of awards and keys
to members of various school activi-
ties. The climax of the morning’s
program, immediately following the
moving-up proper, will be the “tap-

 

ping” of the 1936—37 Myskauia,
scnior honorary society.

The morning program will be con-
cluded with the formation of class
numerals on the Western avenue
campus and the planting of the tra-
ditional ivy. Jayne Buckley, ’36,
will be Ivy speaker.

The class stunts will feature the
afternoon’s program, and then at
night will be the traditional and
impressive step-sing, when the eyes
of even the most stoic of brothers
and sisters of State are dimmed by
the reminiscences of Mincrva’s halls.

...whaz‘.’r happening
in there 4’0 home:

—the curing and ageing of leaf tobacco,

that’s what’s going on.

Thousands of hogsheads of mild ripe
tobacco are under these roofs. . . just lying
here ageing and sweetening and mellow-

ing for Chesterﬁeld cigarettes.
Like Rip Van Winkle, they sleep—the

tohaccos getting mellower and milder
for the cigarette that Satisﬁes.
