Textile Men Score 9—4 Over
State In Second Game
Of Ball Season
The State college baseball team was
turned back for the second time this

tyear when Lowell Textile institute

won last Friday’s garlic 9 to 4.
Sehniitz pitehed a fair game of ball,

but the eoiiibiiiation of fifteen hits
and eleven errors was too much to
overeonie.

liowell scored two runs in the open-
ing inning on a single and two lusty
triples. State was fortunate to hold
them down to two runs. A close
double play, Quattrocehi to O’Brien,
ended the threatening rally in the
bird.

in State’s half of the first, they
put on their biggest rally of the sea-
son that saw an error, a walk, and
three singles produce three runs. The
Purple and Gold had the misfortune
of having a man miss home on n elose
play so that we had an unnecessary
out instead of a run.

how‘ell Tex earned two more runs
iii the third on three singles and two
errors, but Htate tied the seoreiii their
half on two doubles to left field by
(‘rilleii arid Quattroeelii.

The visitors added a run an inning
for the next three frames. The fourth
run was a gift in the form of a walk,
infield out arid an 'error. The fifth
inning saw Sehinitz again in a hole
as a result of' an error and three more
singles. \\'ith the bases loaded, he
striiek out Fox to retire the side. The
sixth run was the result of a walk,
a single, and two errors.

l.owel| prit the game on iee in the
eighth with two more runs when they
eoinbined three hits with two errors

ito give them a total of nine runs.

l"o.\’, the Lowell ’l‘ex piteber who
started in the Summit inning. did not
let a man reaeb third after the fourth
frame. and no two men on the paths
in the same inning.

.\‘ta'e rarned all of their runs, but
earned only five of theirs.
