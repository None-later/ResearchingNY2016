STATE COLLEGE NEWS, MAY 14,

1936

 

Evening Pro ram Will Conclude
Annua Moving—up Ceremonies

As Moving-up Day draws to a close
tomorrow night, the seniors will ex-
perience the thrill of their last “step
sing” conducted traditionally on the
steps of Draper hall. When the
“grand old seniors” rccede into the
distance after the rendering of “Great
Fires”, the. juniors will realize sud-
denly that they are the ones to take
up duties which held formerly so much
awe for them. The sophomores and
freshmen will find it difﬁcult to really
appreciate the full signiﬁcance of their
ﬁrst or second Moving-up Days.

The annual sing will begin at 7:30
o’clock, when all classes of the college
will render the “Alma Mater” led
by Frances Studebaker, ’36, as col-
lege song leader. The successful riv-
alry class will receive three points for
the composition and rendition of the
prize song, which will be judged by
Miss llclen T. Fay, manager of the
“Co-op,” Miss Gertrude Morgan,
assistant instructor of history, and
Dr. Harold W. Thompson, assistant
professor of English. After the com-

 

anuouncement of the winner of inter-
elass rivalry will be made by the
president of the student: association,
’aul llnlger, ’36, who will award the
rivalry cup and announce the winner
of the class stunts, class sings, and
athletic contests.

With the ending of all rivalry be-
tween the classes at 1938 and 1939,
all attention will be concentrated on
the seniors, who, after their singing
of “As Ye Sow”, will have given in
their honor the farewell songs of the
other three classes. The closing reu-
ditions will include the Senior and
junior step songs before the time
comes when the class of 1936, leaving
the halls of State college for the
“wide, wide world”, recedes into the
distance a l'ter completing the musical
symbol of their departure, “Great
Fires ’ '.

'l'hc bleary eyes caused by this spec-
tacle of seeing senior t'ricnds depart

will be cleared for a while, during
the dance which will be conducted,

following the completion or' these cere-

pletion of the sister class songs, thc'mouies. in the l'age hall gymnasium.

Campus Dream Nears Completion
With Plans for Men’s Dormitory

The Alumni Residence hall, planned
and coritemplated for over ten years,
and completed last fall, has nearly
tinished its first year as a home for
almost one hundred ﬁfty college
women. Once funds were pledged
For this project, the alumni of State
college turned to new fields.

The class at ’35 conceived the
idea of a. small residence for men,
to be constructed on the terrace of
the dormitory campus, facing toward
Partridge street. This house would
contain lockers and ﬁeld equipment
ill the basement, with a. men ’s lounge
on the second ﬂoor. Dormitories
and eating rooms would occupy the
third ﬂoor.

Plans for this building were drawn
up, and estimates of probable costs
were obtained. The total decided
upon as necessary is $l0ll,lltlll, one
third of the cost of the women‘s
halls. This is due to the fact that
the grading of the campus and ter-
races about the Alumni hall had to
be completed as a part of the original ,
project. and therefore will not euter‘

 

into the plans for the men’s dormi-
tory. This amount the Alumni asso-
ciation will attempt to secure in
pledges and contributions within five.
