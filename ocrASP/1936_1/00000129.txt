Prospective Mates

“Laugh and get married” seems
to he the slogan of Ur. llicks’ l'lil 5
classes which decided in a survey
taken last week that a sense ot’
humor was the most important thing
for a future husband or wife to

 

possess, ainl, incidentally, for you
:l'llllll't' school teachers, too. Never-
.ilielcss, marriage is not a laughing
'mattcr, one ot' the pupils added.
l intelligence

is nonessential evi-
tdently, since it did not appear on
the prospective wife’s list iit all,

and only at the bottom at the future
husband’s list. Masculinity and
t'cminity ratc only two votes in their
respecliH‘ lists, niid none of the men
think that grooming is of lirst imr
poi'taucc in a wife. “'l’hcy take it
for granted,” one girl commented.
A husband should have foresight,

\tlllll’ of the papers slton’ed. llttl
lli'. lliclts \\;il'nctl the class that “it’
he has too much he won‘t ask her
to inairy him.” (lther top‘i'ating
trails for husbands are generosity

(the majority ot’ men thought this
tinipoitaiit also), sociability, toler-
iunic, ambition, and loyalty. ()ne
'rouiantie miss wanted her husband
"a little shy, but not self conscious”.
Another stoutly declared he’d have
to have intestinal fortitude. (lac
ot‘ the men adds "aggressive, but

 

 

Must Have

not piignacious”. A husband ae-
eording to some of the female ele-
ment in the class should be able to
prodUcc the necessities of life.
“This worries me,” Dr. llicks cun—
didly admitted. None at the women
seemed to want a perfect husband,
one asking that he be imperfect in
minor respects and another hoping
he. would have a certain amount of
conceit.

()n the other hand, the men hold
out strongly for a tolerant wife.
“free from suspicious nature”.
'l’olcrancc ~r“for everything” one
of the girls adds ci‘ypticnlly. Hylll'
patby, loyalty, iiinl cooperation to]

low lll succession. (lite cynic states
"charm she has to bare this or
she won ’t even be a wil’c’ ’. An-

other adds Hllilclleclunl~~~httt not so
as to surpass the intellect ot' the has
band”. (lac ot’ the brighter lights
carefully crossed out. on his paper
the requirement “a good line” and
s u li st i t It t- e d "social capability ’ ',
(we iiiidestand perfectly.) "Not
too easygoing” asserts one paper,
while another adds “diplomatic, able
to handle situations gracefully.”

As for the poor school teacher,
she. is advised to have palicnce~~~
“She’ll need it”- , to be optimistic,
and especially to be non aggressive.
