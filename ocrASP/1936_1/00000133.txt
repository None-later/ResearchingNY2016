 V 'bistorians discuss the beginnings of
U. 8. higher education they must turn ﬁrst
to Cambridge, Mass, home of ‘old, rich, prOud and
and academic (but not isolated) Harvard’ Uni
versity. They must acknowledge that U. S. colv
lege history began with that memorable October
26, 1636. meeting of the General Court of Massachusetts
Bay Colony which passed. undiscussed, an act which
"agreed to give 4oo£ towards a schoalc or colledge."
From that day to this. Harvard history has been the
history of its presidents and endowmentsmfor the twu
have determined the roads to travel and the goals to seek
in physical, educational and scientiﬁc advancement. Its
ﬁrst head was Nathaniel Eaton (he was not digniﬁed with
the title of president), author of one book and lacking a
university degree, who was inducted at 27, dismissed in
1639 for beating and practically starving his charges. Its
present president, James Bryant Conant, assumed Harr
vard's top administrative post in 1934 at the age. of 40,
with many degrees earned, numerous volumes written, and
an enviable scientiﬁc reputation acknowledged. The only
policy common to the ﬁrst and the present administrations
is that of enclosing The Yard with a fence. ‘

At-a-Glance Record

The most atravglance history of Harvard's founding is
contained in these chronological facts:
October 28, 1636—General Court founds a
“colledge.”
November is, ion—“The colledge is ordered to
bee at Newetowne."
November 20, 1637~—First board of overseers ap—

date Nathaniel Eaton was up,
pointed “Professor.”

Morison has spent “only five years" completing

volumes on the subject, is now working on a fourth.

1935

Thus did Presidént Conant, last January i,
invite institutions in all parts Of the world to help
H Harvard and U. S. Higher education celebrate its
~ birthday. Subsequently, invitations went toéspoo
, graduates and exvstudents. No mere historical
' jubilee will be Harvard's Tercentenary, for Presi
dent Conant has decreed that at that time uour anniver'
sary be utilized to demonstrate to the nation at large the
signiﬁcance of all our colleges and universities, . . . (to)
awaken in many minds a consciousness of the necessity
of preserving that great scholarly tradition of education
and free inquiry which first came to these shores three
centuries ago.

To that end, Tercentenary planners have formulated
a distinguished pr ram for scholar and layman alike:
a Tercentenary Exhibition, a Tercentenary Session of the
Summer Schools, meetings of Learned Societies, a Terr
centenary Conference of Arts and Sciences, a meeting of
the Association of the Alumni of Harvard College, and,
on September 16, i7 and 18, the concluding Tercentenary
ceremonies.

Among those who will be in attendance at the 300th
anniversary meetings will be 14 Nobel Prize winners from
the United States and Europe, and a large number of
distinguished learned men from all parts of the world.
The discussions to be led by these men will bring many
first announcements of scientiﬁc studies important to the
lives of all men.

And with the ﬁnal speech of the Tercentenary Meet.
ing on September i8, 3.00 years of higher education in the
U. S. will have been celebratedmforty days before the
actual 300th anniversary of the passage of the law esv
tablisliing America's first institution of higher learning,
and at least one year before the 300th anniversary of the
ﬁrst meeting of a college class held in what is nowthe
United States.
