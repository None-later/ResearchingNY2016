Alibis are foul things; so we will
otter only suggested explanations of
diamond deteats. We deserve a
minor pat on the back for having
scored a run against Norwich. We
were privileged to be the eleventh
.straight victim of the college base-
ball champions of Vermont. Wash-
'burii, their pitcher, has had four
{years of mound experience and is
‘21 slugger to boot. Then, too, their
ldiamond tutor is none other than
Stufty McInnis, erstwhile hot-corner
man of Connie Mack’s famous mil-
lion dollar inﬁeld.

State Concludes Most Extensive
Sports Season of Recent Years

Nearly completed is the most ex-
tensive program of varsity sports

competition and the most: widely
varied intramural athletic set-up
that Stilte has enjoyed in recent

years.

In the varsity field, victory, par-
ticularly over teams ot' narrow repute,
has not been the byword. Ante-a]
victory over or a respectable loss
to teams important in intercollegiate
ranks has been considered the prac-
ticiil road to athletic prominence.

'l‘lie cross-country squad, though
small and handicapped by lack of
organization, engaged the barriers
from RPI, Bard, and Delhi with
some degree ot’ success. They were
badly outrun in the tlrst meet with
Rl’l at Troy, but defeated Bard in
a second engagement. They were
barely nosed out by Delhi in the last
meet ot' the season, with Haynes
not running.

Next year’s schedule will be more
ambitious amt yet probably more
successfully completed, since only
l"u|lagiir ot' this year’s squad will be
lost by graduation. Those who run
this year are li‘ullngar ’ttti, Deltusso,
llayiies, Neulis, lteynolds, and \'i(l<
iii:ir, sophomores, and tiornian and
\\'i|7.iuski, t’reslimcn.

capable hands ot' coach lrving

and a victory over St. Michaels
brought the season to a close. Some-
where, Queens caught the team on
an elf night, and outscored them by
one point.

Captain Bancroft, Margison and
Aiiiyot were strong offensively, while

more daring. Niagara appreciated
State’s basketball prowess enough to
schedule two games for the coming
season.

by R-l’l, 7.2!. Then they routed

In intramural athletics, the sophor

standing. In the hotly contested
iiitriiiiiui‘iil basketball league, the
class ot' ’ilt-l won the second half ainl
the championship, by det’catiug the
.Inniors in a rough game. 'l‘lie inter-

saw the sophomores nosing out the

students, and foreshadowed the com

State.

Varsity To Meet St. Michael:
0n Ridgeﬂeld Diamond

The baseball team will play St.
Michaels at Ridgeﬁcld park tomorrow
at 3:00 o’clock in the ﬁnal game of
the season. This concludes an eight
game schedule against some of the
strongest teams State has ever met.

Errors proved too costly in last
Saturday’s game with Norwich at
Northlleld. Cullen and Aniyot were
responsible for State’s two hits in a
battle that ended with State on the
short end of an 1] to 1 score.

Norwich piled up an early lead
when Washburn’s home run in the
lirst inning knocked three runs
across the plate. State’s swingers,
led by Lynch, the clean-up man, failed
to connect when it would have
counted most, while Norwich, in the
t'ourth inning batted in three, and
four more in the ﬁnal frame. The
twirlers t’onght an even game, Cullen

t’anniiig eight Norwich men, and
\\'asliburii, nine State butters. State

rallied in the last three innings and
settled down to smoother ball play-
ing, when Aniyot crossed the plate
for State’s only score.

in the initial game, Cullen pitched
State to victory over the Bard Col-
lege nine. Subsequent. engagements
proved too much for the (locweyuien,
who ﬁnished second best to R.P.I.,
Lowell 'l‘cxtite, Drew, Pratt, and
Norwich. Manager Dexter announces
advance bookings with Drew, .l’ratt,
and lt.|’.I. for next year’s schedule.
l’icturcs ot' the 1936 squad can be
procured at Marsh’s studio at one
