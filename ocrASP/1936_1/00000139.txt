Class and Extra-Class Endeavor
Both Have Their Place

" Would you tell me, plcusc. which way I ought to go
from here? ”

“ That depends a good deal on where you want to get
to," said the cut.

When you go to Activities day tomorrow
morning, fresh, be sure to sign up for Myskania
and Signuni Laudis, senior scholastic society.

We have had people at State college who
signed up only for Myskania. ’l‘hey 'an them-
selves raggcd working on ext 'a-class activities,
serving on more committees than you can count,
going to all the dances, and playing bridge in
the now closed Activities ot'ticc. Sonic ol.‘ them
were even tapped for Myskania.

They built themselves up for an awful let-
down. Some of thcm tlunkcd out. Many of
them didn't get jobs. Ur their health broke
down. And it' they did get out in the world
of teaching they found themselves handicamicd
by the limits of their scholastic ltllowlcllg't‘.

And there have been those at Statc who signed
up only l'or Signum Laudis. 'l‘hcy stndicd and
studied, got a lot of A's, madc Signum Lamlis.
and saw it printcd in the homc town papcr.

But they lost: out on the social contacts. 'l‘hcir
high scholarship \vcnt l'or nil whcn 1hcy tricd
to get jobs. Sonic wcrc so shy that they wcrc
unable to command a classroom.

“'1' arc prol'oundly com-crncd with thc proh-
lcm ol the right proportion of class and cxlra-
class activities which thc collcgc stlnlcnl should
assume.

BookQEnds

 

 

Students of history and the social sciences would do
well to note the publication of three York State vol-
umes during the past six months. They are especially
enticing to devotees of local history, amt are of general
interest to New York inhabitants.

The ﬁrst. of these, Drums Along the Mohawk, by
Walter Edmomls, author of Rome Haul aml Erie
Waters, continues his chronicles of the history of
middle New York. It is a tale of the sturdy German,
Dutch, and English settlers tenants of the Butlers and
the Johnsons, who refused to accept the political tenets
held by their over-lords. The action is laid during the
Revolution, especially that; racking period of the
()riskuny and Cherry Valley massacres when Joseph
Brant and his llldlltllS swept down from Carleton island
in the St. Lawrence. Though it can not be called a
masterpiece of literature, it is nevertheless a sterling
novel, an excellent hit of Americana, and Well worth
the reading.

in remote hill towns, and lonely farms in York State
valleys is heard the story of the beating of Indian
water-drums, sometimes softly revel-berating between
the hills. The legends surrounding this and other tales
of the York pioneers forms the basis of Carl Curmcr’s
Listen for a Lonesome Drum. Among the curiosities
peculiar to our state are the fake Cnrdill giant, the
remnants of the Shaker religion, the traditional aml
illegal cock-lights, and the ceremonies of the reserva-
Lion Indians. Each section of the state is fully cov—
cred; the book abounds with tales of unique bands of
horse-thieves which infested the country around Humil-
ton, of New York’s contestant for Paul llunyun’s
honors, and of the strange practices of the various
religions fanatics that overrun the state from time to
time.

Edward Hungert‘ord, a native of the North Country,
has a particular interest in the scenic beauties uml the
llne buildings to be found in New York villages. Ills
book, Pathway of Empire, is illustrated with photo-
graphs of our waterfalls, picturesque covered bridges,
and the old houses which may well rival Virginia's
Colonials. llc writcs Inorc of the contemporary life of
our state than the other two, describing the changes
that have come about within the span ot" sixty years.
