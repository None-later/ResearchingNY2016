Coach Hatfield Plans

Men’s Intramural Athletics Have Widest Participation:
Basketball Squad to Face Difﬁcult Schedule

G. lillliot llattield, football and
baseball coach at Union College for
the past live years, iir assurrring the
coaching reins at State prediets sue
cesst’ul learns for the earning season,
particularly in basketball. Mr. Hat-
iield has eoaelred and directed the
athletie program at Lowell Wyoming

elrester University, and at Union.

A football team is out of the ques-
tion, at. least for this year. State
cannot: muster either the man power

or the money that. intercollegiate
football demands, according to ('oaeh
llattield. And a selredule ot' garires

with high selrool and eollege t'resh-
rrrarr teams would be satist'aetory to
no one.

The future for this year's basket-
ball squad is bright. With t'ormer

only the center position remains to
lie tilled. Seven iireiiibers ot' last
year's squad will be trying for start-
ing berths, partienlnrly at eerrler.
'l‘lre sehedule has been eut soiirewhat
by the eaireellatiorr ot' several mid-
week garires, but still ineludes still'
opponents. Niagara, with irrosl ot’
last season ’s powerl’nl quintet return-

opposition, (lames with lll‘l. St.
