diriner” may wake up his wealthy master to
enjoy the perfect melon—picked by Iamplight

Like the Persian melon,
the Turkish tobaccos used in Chesterﬁeld
are watched day and night.

There is just one right time to take off
the leaves. . .that’s when they have ripened

to' their fullest ﬂavor.

Often the tender ripe leaves are gathered
just before the dawn...to preserve the full
“spice” and aroma for Chesterﬁeld.

Chesterﬁeld: are made by

Liggeu 6f Myers Tobacco Co.

From our own South/and we take mild, ripe

the Mediterranean [or the ﬁne ﬂavor and
