Honor Societies
Grow At State

1917 Sees Myskania’s Start;
All Others Commence
At Later Date

 

 

In the twenty years since the
News was founded there has grown
up at: State college four honorary
societies. Myskania, Kappa Phi
Kappa, Pi Gamma Ma, and Signum
[media are honorary societies that
reward different types of activities.

Myskania was founded in 1917 as
a senior honorary society to be com-
posed of incoming seniors who ex-
celled in scholarship, literary effort,
debate, dramatics, and undergraduate
utt'airs, generally. Tito members are
elected in the spring of their junior
year uml those elected are topped
on Moving-up Day. The student
association president is an ex-oﬂlcio
member and three others are chosen
by popular vote of the Student as-
sociation.

In November, 1927, the Delta New
York chapter of Pi Gamma Mu,
national honor fraternity for stu=
dents ot’ social science, was founded

at State. college. This fraternity
replaced llerodotus, a local State
college social studies fraternity.

Membership in l’i Gamma Mu is
limited to juniors and seniors who
have a major interest in Social
studios and have a “15” average.

in April, 1927, Chi chapter of
Kappa Phi Kappa was founded at
State college. Kappa Phi Kappa is
a national honorary education so-
ciety for men and is limited to se-
looted uppcrclassmcn and certain
members ot’ the faculty.

President lirubachcr in 1930 ap-
pointed a committee of the faculty
to term an honorary scholastic so-
ciety for State college to be known
as Hignnm ltandis. 'l‘his society is
composed ot' the highest ten per
cent ot’ the senior class who have
maintained a it average. li‘our per
cent. ot' the class is chosen in Novem-
hcr and the other six per cent in the
spring.

 

Journalism Trends

 

 

 

An artlclc written by it). It. Van
Kloook, ‘Ztl, editor at the ’i‘enth
Anniversary News. amt reprinted
from that Issue.

Never before in the history at

newspaper production have so strik-
ing tendencies toward change been
t'\i(it‘llt. l'crhaps thcro have been
more vital eras in the story ot’ col-
lege journalism. But it is doubtful
it' in any other decade hoth amateur
and professional pructicc have shown

such distinct trends toward dctlnito
goals.
The two nmjor trends in our

modern lil'e are: tlrst, in the tiold of
economics: amt second, in the intel-
lectual ﬁeld, the movement toward
a lihcrnlism ot’ thought through ap-
plication of tho spirit of inquiry.

In recent years the change in pro-
l'essionnl journalism has closely paral-

lolod the general economic trend
toward stnmlardizntion, l’rot’es-
sionnl journalism has assumed a

dotinlto homl toward tho largo scale
activity that has distinguished other
tlolds oiY otl'ort.

l‘ivon more recently, college jutu‘»
nnlism has stoorod the same course
that. intollcctnul development is
taking. in the last few years. the
oollogo papers have assumed the
lotul in tho moycmont toward so»
called "student omum-ipution."
While the liberals have hcon husying,r
themselves pulling at tho meritago
ot’ dogntutism left by the nineteenth
and preceding centuries, the college
papers have been putting their col-
leges ttmlor the microscope, applyng
the spirit ot’ inquiry directly to tru-
ditiunal academic ereods with such
success that everywhere their efforts
have made themselves heard so that
results have mieossarily followed.
