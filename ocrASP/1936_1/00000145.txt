A, new athletic season will soon
be unfolding itself before eyes that
are hopeful and yet dubious. Will
State have successful teams this
year? Will the basketball squad
beef. the calibre of the ﬁne court
aggregations of the past two sea-
aona?’ Conjunctive to these prob-
lems, every freshman is plied right
and left with queries as to his
athletic prowess.

We like to think of the 1936—
1937 cage team as one of great
promise. From last year’s sporadi-
cally great team, returning are three
of the starting five and eight other
squad members. Bancroft, last
year’s captain, and co-captain Dick
Margison should ease Coach Hat-
ﬁeld’s offensive worries while Duke
Hershkowitz and co-eaptain John
Ryan should prove stumbling blocks

 

 

to high scoring opponents. Then,
too, last season’s freslnnan team

will be ready for varsity service.

A small corps of umber-legged,
smooth-muscled youths have been
carrying on in amazingly successful
fashion for the past few years—
carrying on without coaching, recog-
nition, or any official support what-
soever. They come in assorted sizes,
but they certainly can belly roll, the
whole four of them. Among our
newcomers, fresh from the waste-
lands of our Empire State, must
there not be one straight-bodied lad
who can do an intelligent back ﬂip?
Hie ye to Joe LeGraff, '38, or Bill
Torrens, '39, ye supple-trunked
greenhorns, and learn of tumbling
activities at State.

No dearth of intramural lields of
application will exist this year.
Note the long row of papers to sign
on the bulletin board by the men’s
locker room. ’l‘herc's no crew yet——
but still it‘s a long distance to
carry a boat from school here "way
down to the lllidson.

Already on Page hall's year old
basement ﬂoor can bt heard the
dribble of the basketball. Aspiring
twine-ticklers are rapidly accustom-
ing the mesh to the “swish” of a
neatly aimed ball. Cooperation
abounds. So, soon we can predict
victory in the Bard game.

ward sweep of the hand, and a

was adopted. The News was placed
umlcr the blanket tax, and its linan
cial worries were over.

also at one time was housed in the
room which is now occupied by the
cafeteria annex.

’J‘hc stall” ot' the News in its
twenty years ot’ existence has in-
creased more than six-t’old. The

original editorial and business stall'
was composed ot' only twelve mcm-
bers. 'l‘his lmd increased to t’orty-
two nu-inbcrs at the time ot’ the
tenth anniversary issue in 1926, and
the present stall' includes 70 mem-
bers on the cditorinl stall' and 10
members ot' the business organization.

The nmny student readers ot' the
NEWS lmvc little idea how many
changes the paper has undergone
since its birth ten years ago. in

addition to an increase in size, the
News has been improved and its
reading matter accentuated by
smaller lypc, larger hcudliucs, aml
the t'rcqncnt use ot’ illustrations.

lack ot’ Journalistic training. How
ever, this tirst issue presented an
almost impossible task to the lirst
board, amt only the highest praise
is due thcm t’or tbcir cll'ort. The
News ot’ today showing the progress

ot’ twenty years, covers cvcry stir
dent activity and intcrcst. it brings
to the student and alumni every

phase ot' collcgc lit'c.

Men’s Athletic association will
conduct a highly varied and mildly
intensiﬁed intramural athletic pro-
gram duriug the coming year. Fall
sports will consist of events charac-
teristic ot’ the stimulating weather—
touch football, soccer, aml cross
country. Popular demand has in-
cluded autumn softball and custom
has brought back the well-established
t’ull tennis tournament.

A touch football league will be
conducted under the same plan as the
interclass basketball league. Games
will be played on the field behind

the Alumni Residence hall, which
has been equipped with goalposts
for the occasion. It is felt that:

touch football together with soccer
will satisfy the lust of State men
for the more bruising intercollegiate
football, which is impossible under
present. conditions. Hoecer, demand-
ing as it does, little equipment, and
furnishing exercise for large Illllll-
bers, shows promise ot' popularity.

Cross country will he introduced
this tall other than as a varsity
sport for the first time. Single class
and inter-class meets will be run oti‘
over short distances, probably about
two miles. 'l‘hesc class races should
develop a wealth ot' varsity material
alul create more interest in the sport
around college.

A tennis tournament is conducted
twice annually amt can be run oll‘
successfully only with a maxinnun
degree ot' cooperation from persons
interested. The list of those who
have signed up for the fall tourna-
ment will be seeded and bracketed
with actual play starting Monday,
October  Hol’tbnll, very popular
when playing conditions permit, will
lind many adherents. ’l‘hc antnnm
contests will act as a sort of tonic
for the more intensive spring series
of games.

Swimming will commence as soon
as a pool can be obtained and will
carry on throughout the year. if
interest demands it, a. swimming
meet may become a permanent tix-
tnrc. Winter sports will include
basketball, a l'oulrshooting' contest,
volley ball nml bowling, while spring
will usher in thc intcrclnss track
meet, together with sot’tbnll.

Active cooperation ot' tllc men ot’
the college is requested by l‘ldwurd
llnlihun, ’37, manager ot' intra-
mural sports, ’l‘homas Harrington,
’37, .\lAA head, (‘oach llatlicld, and
other nn-mbcrs ol’ the executive
collllcil ot' the Association. 'l‘hc in-
lrnnmrnl program is the child ot’
every nmn in the college, and it is
only with uniticd nursing on the
part ot' all that the ﬂedgling can be
rcnrcd to nnitnrity.
