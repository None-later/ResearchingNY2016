Once upon a time about fourteen
years ago, a State college football
team, the ﬁrst gridiron squad in
the history of the institution, took
the ﬁeld against the Union freshman
eleven. Our forbears, “making
.their debut on the gridiron for the
ﬁrst time in seventy years," were
defeated 16—6. Caton, State’s full.
back, scored those six points on an
eighty-five yard touchdown sprint.
“ For the ﬁrst time in seventy
years " can best be interpreted as
meaning that during that stretch of
time, State was ofﬁcially credited
with not having a football team.
.Before then, they hadn’t thought of
it, anyway.

The 1922 team met with no out-
.standing success, a scoreless tie with
the Rochester School of Optometry
representing their best showing.
liut tlley had oodles of ligllt. Trail-
blazers, they hoped tlley would be
called someday. Unfortunately foot-
ball as a varsity sport was continued

 

 

for only two more ylars. Man
power was conspicuoust lacking,
with every tentll State student

lucky to be a man. in a couple of
years, with the woman-to-man ratio
reduced to 2-1, migllt it not be pos-
sible to take up where the teams of
tilt! Harding-Coolidge regime left off,

and sort of re-pioncer the grid
movcnlent‘.’
Back to ’22. In addition to the

initial defeat and the scoreless tie,
the State eleven dropped games to
RPI fresh, 39—0, and to St. Stephen’s
by a large score. lnexperience paved
the way for most; of the defeats.
The line was fairly strong, but the
team was almost without a pass
defense.

The second year of the short his—
tory of the sport here saw a more
ditlicult schedule tllan that ol' the
lirst year, bllt brought a little more
success to our bard-lighting. ill-sup~

ported warriors. Wbltcwashed ill
the lirst three games, by St.

Lawrence. Hl-(l, by Worcester 'l‘ccli,
Ila—U, alal by Williams trosli, they

came back to bowl over the Ile-
stroycr lh'cck tea ill, III—ll. and close
the season by losing to the RH

l'rosh, 7—0, in a well played game.
How sure of what was to come in
the way of an opponent must have
been the eleven of that season. To
quote from the October 26 issue of

.the New: “ Tomorrow State Will
tackle one of the three following
.teams at Ridgetield park: U.S.S.
Destroyer “Knox” eleven, Albany
High School, or Troy Commerce
Academy.”

CoagIL Hatfield Changes Basketball Schedule

Niagara To Play
in ngtest Here

Hartwick Added in Revision;
Squad to Meet R. P. I.
In First Game
Recently released with corrections
for -:incell:ltioiis and additions, is
the State College basketball schedule
for the 1936—1937 season. Changes
in the schedule as originally planned
have removed all but one midweek
game, that with Western Ontario,
and included a game with llartwick

at ()neouta.

Seventeen contests are listed, eight
away and nine at home, commenc-
ing with R.P.1. at Troy on Decem-
ber 5 and closing with llartwick,
away, on March 13.

The two encounters with Niagara
will be the toughest of many tough
ones. Niagara represented the Gen-
tral New York district in the Olympic
basketball tryouts and lost to a
strong 'l'cniple team by only two
points. This year the Roaring Cata-
racts look forward to an even luore
successful season, with few players
lost by graduation, alld plenty of
lanky replacements.

A game with lt.l’.l. is always
thrill-packed. The noise from the
bleachers is tremendous even during
dull moments of the game.

 

 

'l‘bc liuti'alo State Teachers Col-
lege court squad matches baskets

with State for the lirst time ill recent
years. They have long claimed as
their very own tlle teachers college
and normal school championship of
the state. This year they will have
actual basis on which to claim the
championship or relinquish it.

The schedule is packed with other
strong opponents, a very very few
pusliovcrs and two (‘anadian teams.

The Schedule:

Fall Tennis Tournament Brings
Forty Competitors Into Lists

 

 

Fresh to Meet Milne
In Initial Court Tilt

The lid will be torn oil. the
basketball season Friday, No-
vember 20, when a team repre-
senting the class of ’40. the
ofﬁcial freshman team for the
coming year, will tee otl’ against
the Millie High school cage
team. Richard Margison, ’37,
is coach of the Milne high
squad, while Thomas Barring-
ton, ’37, MAA head, is the fresh
tutor.

l’ractice begins next week for
lads of the practice school, who
are ill the capable managerial
hands of William llotnling. A
week later the freshman squad,
which will act as a sort of junior
varsity this year, commences
training. (leorgc Mallinson, ’38,
an assistant basketball manager,

will serve as manager of the
ycarlings.

Last year, the freshman five
nosed out the Milne basket-

tosscrs, 24432. Out for revenge
and always dangerous, the high
school team should put up a
lilie scrap. The power of the
ncopliytes, as ever, so early, is
but visionary. Anyway, more of
it to thcln.

Autumn coughs up thoughts of pret-

tin falling leaves, brilliant harvest
moons and the fall tennis tourna-
ment. Jvery year, ambitious racquet
wielders sign up to meet opponent
after opponent and finally, having
moppcd the field, to run off with the
crown. Only one lucky fellow real-
izes his dream but all feel the thrill
of clay-court competition and the
matching of their skill and head-
work against opponents of unknown
quantity.

Forty men have signed up for this
year’s tourney. First round games
are already in play. The completion
of the schedule is in the hands of the
students and a maximum of coopera-
tion is requested from every partici-
pant by llldward I-Iulihan, ’37, inan-
ager of intramural sports.

Large Squad Begins Practice;
Manager Sees Success
For Harriers

The State college cross-country
team has been pounding up and down
hills for almost two weeks now,
whipping itself into shape for this
most grueling of sports. The largest
and most ambitious squad in years is
out, with gobs of experience repro-
sentcd. Delhi, RPI, and Bard are
almost certain to match strides over
the long route with the tireless
Teachers—and equally as certain to
tiud the competition still.

Says Edward Reynolds, ’38, mana.
gcr of the hustling harriers and a
continued pessimist, of this fall’s
squad:

“(lo-captain Fullagar is the only
nmn lost from last year’s team.
Haynes is showing his heels to all
of us so far. We 're looking for a
freshman sensation. The team is
pretty cocky this year and looks for-
ward to a very successful season.
Don’t quote me on this, etc.”

Youths practicing include letter-
inen llarold Haynes and Edward
Reynolds, juniors, and Anthony Wil-
czynski, ’39: old timers TomMeehan,
’37, Joseph Vidmar and Joseph
DcRusso, juniors aml William Hopke,
James Johnson, Cecil Marine, and
Walter Russ, sophomores; and fresh-
men Frank Augustine, Louis Fran-

 

cello, Otto llowe, llomer Log-
gett, Louis Rickmaa, and Steven
.Szawlowski.
