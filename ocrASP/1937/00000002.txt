Of Cabbages and Kings

We Inirc been watching with great glee the manner
in which our t'riends, one after one, succumb to the
reading ot' “(ione with the Winn”, at'tcr vociferous
and mighty declarations to have nothing to do with Ii
book ot‘ that length. incidentally, we feel proud that
we accomplished the reading within the lirst month ot'
its publication. The book would be noteworthy it' only
l’or its portrait ot' the south during the Reconstruction
period, but is cliiii'actcrization of the beautiful Scur-
lctt (l’llarn, hcr colorful story and tinal subtly tragic
downfall. Iuakc it doubly important. We noticed that
Miss “lit-cling rccounnciidcd it as the ideal (,llii'isl'iinis
gift. it you failed to do your shopping curly, act
without delay, and beg, borrow, or st -al the book for
immediate pcrusnl.

We welconic with loud liuzznhs and blowing ot’ horns
the information that Music Council is bringing l‘ci'cy
