Pretzel, Original Humor Magazine of State
Under Pressure of Readers’ Wrath

Abdicates

Even before the (lay of the State
College Lion, students of State col-
lege were funny. So in May of 1924,
three students pooled their wits and
finances and published :1 humor
magazine, The I’rctscl. which was, in
their own words, “a college humor
magazine published whenever we. feel
funny.”

This maiden issue with its bright
purple and gold cover, sold for ten
cents a copy and began to wood its
way to the various students willng
to part with a (lime.

The magazine contained some. very
spicy stories which were funny,—
humorous, so to speak. One clever
idea was an alleged reproduction of
the first pagc ot' the State College
Snooze. The biggest headline spread
over the top of the center columns
read as follows:

l'All'l‘ ()l“ AUTO 'l‘lltl‘)

FOUND IN MEAT l.0.»\l-‘

A subhcad nndcr that rcad: “An-
other instancc of thc automobilc
replacing the borsc.” The story

went on to explain how the cafeteria
happened to incorporate this par-
ticular piece of tire into the meat
loaf? at that time.
Another big story
headline the following:

MAN SLEEPS 0N-
l’Sl GAMMA l’()lt(‘ll
(lroans Attract ()iliccr
Ambrose llarrignu of
Fifth Precinct

lt seems that. this Otlicer Ambrose
was strolling by in the early morn-
ing when he thought he heard a dog
growling. Upon investigation he
found that the, sounds emitted from
a masculine individual soundly asleep
on a hammock on the. l’si (lamina
porch.

At the left of the page was a mast
head which stated that the State
College Sumner was published “semi-
occasionally” and that its editor-in-
chiet‘ was Sleeping Beauty.

("artoons of’ students wcrc also in-
cluded. “llig shots” were taken

had for its

 

for a ride. After their pictures a

 

of their school activities
f’ollowcd. A selection of these activi-
ties is as t'ollowa: “Cheerleader of
Finance Board, Necking Club (1, 2,
1i, 4——prcsidcnt 4), Manager of Puss
in the. (‘orucr, Football (-l-, 5, (i),
Moving~Up |)ay balloon connnittce,
\\'byskania, Ku |\'|ux Klan, John
llarlcycorn Society and l’inocbie
Club,”

Alas, though, the l’rrtscl was
doomed pastry, even while it was
hot. Students who “couldn’t. take
it” joined in an opposition which
became so bitter that the Pretzel
was offered up as a peace sacrifice.
The first issue was the last. Those
people. should have. taken to heart
the poem at the beginning of the
issue whose third stanza read as.
follows:

“It' you get borscd or razzcd herein

Don’t rise in indignation

lint like a martyr sweetly grin

Each knock you get boosts

culntion."

brict' list:

cir-

.\nd so tbc pretzel died. a twisted
bit of crust.
