’ Vermont Trip Nets '
Squad First Victory

 

BASKETEERS OVERCOME
NORWICH QUINTET, 23-17

 

Succumb 42-31 to St. Michaels’
Strong Team in Friday
Nights’ Game

 

The purple ainl gold hasketeers
motored to Vermont last weekend
to split on two games played with
hiin class Green mountain teams.
Friday night, St. Michael’s college,
of Winooski, hung a 42—31. beating
on the Teachers while Saturday
night, at Nortlitield, a highly touted
Norwich live fell before the Pedaiits’
onslaught, 23—17.

St. Michael’s proved to he a team
of sliarpsliooters. They made good
fourteen out. of twenty tries from
the foul line and were accurate from
iill corners. State's playing was
sporadic. They started off very
poorly, letting the \\'inooski Whirl-
winds pile up a big lend, only to
have it cut down to t7—Il at half
time. The first. ten minutes of the
second half marked State’s biggest
gain. At the end of this fraction of
the latter half, the score stood at
:28 all. It was from then on, par-
ticularly in the closing tivc minutes
of the game, as the score indicates,
that St. Michael’s walked olf with
the game. A lapse in State’s de‘
feiisive play that paralleled a St.
Michael’s spurt gave them the
eleven point advantage they held at
closing time.

The victory over Norwich was
State’s first win in live starts this
season. it was an auspicious victory,
though, gathered as it was on a large
and foreign court aml through nice
passwork. Only the basket-t’ollowing
and the lay-up shooting of the purple
aml gold appeared a little weak dur-
ing the conquest.

Norwich went into the game sport-
ing a perfect record for its two pre-
vious games. They seemed to be a.
little oil form, though the work of
llattield iii the backcourt and Stone
at forward stood out. For State,
(leorgo Amyot, with four well
directed long shots to his credit, and
Bancroft, displaying his last, season ’s
playing form for the first time,
showed the way.

The purple powerhouse moved into
an early lead and held it throughout
the game. .\t the half, the score was
lit—T. During the tirst twelve or four-
teen minutes of the second half, the
game moved along evenly, with no
substantial cut being made into
State’s lead. Then came the moment
of collapse of non-collapsi- on the
part of the team ahead, the critical
point wlicic successful rallies start
or are nipped in the bud. llnring
these all-important closing minutes,
State controlled the hall, putting
Norwich on the defensive, from which
position they were obvioust unable
to tally. During the whole contest,
the f'adcts scored but four Iicld
baskets.

A glorious weekend was had by
all in Vermont. Burlington was the
principal stopping-off place of the
squad, supplying them with its at-
mosphere for approximately twenty-
four hours. The University of Ver-
mont and gray Lake Champlain were
principal points of attraction in thi,
the largest city in Vermont.

llennington and Ruthin Were mct
both ways and approved of. Rut.-
liiml was like Burlington in many

 

respects, but smaller. Bennington
was on the order of a pleasant
medium-sized village. Middleluiry,
where is located Middlebury col-

lege might well be likened to lieu-
ningtou while Montpelier, the state
capital, was disappointing.

The squad reached Burlington
about three o'clock Friday afternoon,
napped brieﬂy, and motored a few
miles across the river to St. Michael’s
college of Winooski.

St. Mike's seemed to be on that
night. Shots from all angles bobbed

around a while aml then dropped

imiii. State played an alternately
lousy and wild first liiilf. 'l‘lie (‘utlio-

them at the half.

The Teachers’ fast breaking offense
brought the score to 28—all a little
past midway in the second half.
Then something snapped and. stamina

to lose them in the closing minutes.

the play of Norwich a little ragged.

Next the State col-

Niagara and Toronto Universities;
and after a prolonged week of scho-
lastic trials and tribulations will
make a weekend trip to the western
part of the state, clashing with
Niagara, Buffalo State Teachers, and
Hobart on the three consecutive
nights of February 4. 5, and 6
respectively.

MEETS PRATT TONIGHT
IN HOME ENCOUNTER

Engineers Will Furnish Stiff
Opposition at 8:00;
Dancing Follows

l'i-att institute, recent victor over
Davis and ltllkins, a good southern
team, comes up from the metropolis
to tangle with the Teachers tonight.
Last year, the institute team, deadly
shooters, bowled over the purple and
gold, 40-27, on their court. This
season, they are invading the capital
district, ready to repeat their for-
mer performance. Much better pre-
pared, in this case of revenge, is
State's anther avalanche, fresh from
last week’s split.

The linein for State is a matter
of speculation as yet. it is pron
able, however, that the live that
bagged the initial victory over Nor-
wich, will be given further chance
to demonstrate its mettle. liikcly
starters are: llaiierot't at center; two
from (i. .\myot, .l. llyan, and liar-
ringtoii at guards: and two from
Margison, 'l‘. Ryan, and llyrnes at
forward.

l-’rc-game riunor has it that l’ratt

is the strongest opponent to face
State this season. llavis aml l‘llklns

really came to New York city to play
Long lslaiid university in the Garden.
They went through with it aml were
beaten, not too badly, by the ltlnck-
birds. one of the nation’s strongest
tivcs. While on the road, they met
l’ratt too, and were again beaten.

(tut of this informational muddle
crawls the fact. that l’ratt will fur-
nish the 'l‘cacliers with the toughest
of opposition.

llnncing will follow the game with
l‘rntt, in Page hall :ilnlilorium.
