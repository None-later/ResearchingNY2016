Friday, January 8, the freshman

dcl'catcd lleatley high scllool 20—15 in
what turned out to be one of the lnost
exciting arid hard fought gmncs ot'
the freshman schedule. The year-
lillgs out to justify their mentor’s
faith in them determined to win this
game or else. The team, in a scrappy
mood, started oll' with a bang, tasting
ﬁrst blood. by the end of the halt’
they had garnered lcli points to their
opponent ’s two.

In the second half the 40’ers
opened tip their defense slightly bllt
their attack still l'unctioncd with all
smoothness alni power and they kept
on the large side ot’ the score for the
remainder of the game, outscoriiig
their rivals in the second half Jti ill
to turn ill a decisive victory.

The team was in a conﬁdent and
aggressive mood and its type ol‘ play
reliceted plenty ot' stamina and dc-

ceptioli. For the lirst time, this year

Teachers’ Union Demonstrates
"Against Wage Cuts, Oath Bill

.b‘ive hundred teachers of New
York City, members of the American
Federation ot' Teachers, marched up
capitol hill to the Monday night ses-
siou ot' the state legislature to do-
iiiaiid the abolition of their salary
cuts and the repeal of the teachers’
oath law.

Through poor management and
unavoidable circumstances, this ges-
turo accomplished little along tangi-

lranspiring events as witnessed by a
representative ot' the State (‘ollegc

be lost by the teachers, a special train
was chartered, leaving New York at
4:30 o’clock to arrive at Albany at
7:30 o’clock, for a three hour stay
in the capital city. This tilne limit
formed the chief reason for the
inell'eetiveness of the venture.

The parade “organized” in the
Albany depot, and proceeded minus
police escort. As a result, the lilie,
in attempting to run the gauntlet ot'
trallie signals, was broken in many
places. The linal disorgaiiiziug stroke
was served at the door ot’ the capitol
when the American llllg, two banners,
arid live hundred people strove to go
through the revolving doors iil mar-
tial formation. Somehow, it didn’t
work.

Once at the capitol, a slnall group
met in conference with (lovernor
Lehman. The rest divided and made
a mad dash for seats ill the senate
and assertiny galleries. The purpose
ol.‘ their attendance at the legislative
chambers was to introduce resolutions
and speakers for their cntrsc.

The assembly was in a slate ot’ dis‘
organization due to its inability to
elect. a speaker, and so adjourned in
short order. Thus the delegation lic-
complished nothing ill the assembly.

In the senate, at whose session your
correspondent attended, a similar
amount of work was accomplished.
Two hundred teachers decorated the
gallery and listened to that austere
body ironchalantly introduce and dc«
Iiale routine resolutions riiilil the time
came for them to make the retreat to
the depot. 'l‘hus ended the protest
march.

Announce Engagement

.-\iinonncement has been r'cceiv‘ed oi"
the engagement of ('larice Simmons,
’32, to Williiiiii Yates, a graduate ot'
St. Lawrence University. Miss Sim-
mons and Mr. Yates are members ot’
the t’aculty ot’ the Monticello High
School.

 

Juniors to Name”
Queen Nominees

Intensive Dues Drive Limits
Eligibility For Voting
And Candidacy

 

Nominations for Prom queen will
be in order at a meeting of the
Junior class to be conducted Thurs-
day iil room 206 at 12:00 o’clock,
according to Dorothy Cain, ’38, gen-

erttl chairman ot’ Junior week-end.
It‘ivc candidates will probably be
nominated.

As part of an intensive drive to
collect class dues, the budget com-
iiiitlce has passed the following
regulations: No ,iniiior may be
candidate l’or l’rom queen, vote for
l’rom queen, or serve on any of the
coniiiiiltces unless class dues are paid
ill l'nll.

lliics are payable to any member of
the budget coiiimillee named as fol-
lows: Janet llibble, Muriel Cold-
bcrg, Jean lliclienstein, Leslie Knox,
Marjorie t‘rist, Warren llciisnlore,
Florence Zulu-es, and Herbert Drooz.

The class is considering having the

decorations done by the 'l‘l'ahon
decorating company. This concern

has done the decorating for such
colleges as l'nion, Cornell, and H.131.

The places for the Prom, luncheon,
and tea dalice have not as yet been
decided upon. However, they will be
announced very shortly.

At a regular committee meeting,
the junior class decided to maintain
the dates ot' lt‘ebruary ill and 20 for
the Junior ii'eek-cnd. This was due
to the fact that many members of
the alumni are planning to attelld the
dances.

'l'he nulsic committee is trying to
cligagc a band ot’ national fame and
popularity to furnish the music. At
present, lied Nichols and His Five
Little Pennies, Dan Murphy, Chick
Webb, and Julian \Voodwol'th are
being considered.
