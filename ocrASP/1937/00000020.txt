Batliing Suit ls Best-Seller

Among Many White Elephants

The annual White Elephant sale
on Wednesday, sponsored by the
.Young Women’s Christian Associa-
tion, presented a scene comparable to
a busy day in the New York Stock
Exchange. Prices soared, and bidders
were watching their favorite articles
with an eagle eye. “Judge” Ed-
wards and Lillian Shapiro held forth
on the auctioneer’s block, supported
by a few upper-class friends.

A great assortment of novelties,
clothing and jewelry were displayed
on tables, each marked with a price
tag, but when they reached the auc-
tioneer, they suddenly acquired a new
value.

The jewelry table was given almost
undivided attention by Alonzo Du-
Mont and James Vanderpoel, seniors.
Jack Dcno, ’37, became the proud
possessor of a bottle of very ex-
clusive perfume. He paid seven cents
for it, and we’ll bet eight cents that
he uses it in the near future!

A little controversy arose over the
sale of a bathing-suit, but as usual,

orchid to King Solomon!

The mystery of the afternoon was
a very handsome blue suede shoe—
not a pair of shoes, but a lone shoe
and in very good working order.
Many of the shoppers searched in vain

for its mate without success. We
feel that it was a professional
hecklcr.

Compacts sold at a premium, but
car-rings had to be given away. We
never realized the importance of pot‘
holders before, but after a. little
persuasion, someone in the audience
became convinced that no family
should be without some and paid an
enormous price for the only two in
circulation.

There was a super-abundance of
fountain pens culled from the Lost
and Found box, but a noticeable ab-
sence of Christmas neckties. Is Aunt

N.S.F.A. Delegates Give Data
On Problems Vital to State

Connecting the problems of State
college with those studied at the
National Student. Federation confer-
ence in New York city, Warren
ileusmore and Leslie Knox, juniors,
and representatives to the National
Student Federation conference, gave
their reports in the student assembly
Friday. John Dene, ’37, gave a brief
rcsnmé of the conference.

Leslie Knox explained that the
conference believed the exchange of
dramatic productions with other col-
logos in the vicinity would enable us
to enliven our assembly programs
and make friends with the nearby

colleges. He also brought out the
points that if sororities and fra-
ternities would use collective bar-

gaining they could lower their cost
of living.

The convention went on record as
favoring the American Youth Act but
believed such acts were not always

properly :ulministercd. llc men-
tioned that the conference con-
dcmncd paddling in initiation. ’l‘he

 

conference also favored a peace
strike and the end of militarization.

Mr. Donsmore spoke upon the fact
that the N.S.1“.A. is aiding many
(lei-man students to obtain an educa-
tion in this country. The conven-
tion also set up a commission to
handle the problem of toachcrs’ col-
lcgcs. This is to function throughout
lhis year aml so keep an accurate
check on such problems.

Mr. Densmore explained that we
are connected by the student fcdera-
tion in a world wide student or.
ganizatiou. Another important world
wide feature mentioned by Mr. Dens-
morc is the student investigations
which gave an illuminating report
this year on the revolution in Spain.

Mr. Dene, who was elected chair»
man of the Middle Atlantic region
of the federation, told of the re-
organization of this region so that
the colleges could emnmunicato more
often with each other. This will also
aid the students of this district to
work more easily on their problems.
