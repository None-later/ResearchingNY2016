defeat.

A superficial perusal of the results
of State's basketball efforts so far
this season would produce no ad-
miratory exclamations from one un-
acquainted with things hereabouts.
But we who like to refer to our-
selves as homesters can find much
to salvage from what might be
termed the wreckage.

Games won to date are few, we
grant. Norwich aml Toronto alone
have fallen before the sword of the
Minervites. The Maple Leafs, our
second international opponent of the
season, had much more scoring suc-
cess against. Union than against us.
And our defeat of Norwich was their
initial setback of the year.

Our ﬁrst three games resulted in
RPI, Western Ontario, and
Brooklyn Poly slapped us down by
narrow margins. Each of these
games has been classiﬁed under the
head “ should have won," and pos-
sibly righteously so. Yet these were
far from weak opponents. RPI de-
feated Williams, Brooklyn Poly de-
feated RPI by a larger score than
that by which they defeated us, and
Western Ontario—well, they gave

.Canisius a good run.

Next the purple and gold mashed
into the Green Mountains where they
first extended their losing streak to
four anti then snapped it at that
ﬁgure. St. Michael's proved to be :1
Gibraltar, :1 nemesis, and a 'l'nrtar.
'l‘lieir baskets had at certain lnrc for
u lntll from their fingertips. 'l‘hcy

moved away from u late-game 738—,

all knotted count to n -l:.’r3l \ictory.
Against Norwich, the nc\i night, was
garnered the first win of the season,
a 23—17 victory.

Back home again, State showed
good basketball against Pratt—the
best of the season in the first two-
thirds of the beginning half. We
dropped that one, 40—32, but it was
a well played game. Regular class
session over for the first semester,
the team engaged Niagara and Tor-
onto in pseudo-celebration. Friday
night, the cataract city team won
the first half and State won the
second half; Niagara was awarded
the game on points. Toronto, after
giving Union a battle failed again
against us. Their offense was much

less effective in the game With us
than in their contest With the
Schenectady college.

Quintet To Face
Hartwicli Squad

State Will Battle Tomorrow
With Oneonta Cagers
On Page Court

State’s purple and gold basketeers
will be out to break back into the
winning column tomorrow night when
they play host to the shifty Hart-
wick aggregation on the Page Hall
court in what should be the “hottest”
game of the season.

Last season State split with the
Onconta cagers in their two engage-
ments. At Oneonta Coach John-
son’s squad ekod out a narrow 27—25
victory after a hotly contested battle
which was cliinaxed by Hurtwick’s
“foul-throwing” net. In the
second encounter State “went to
town” in probably what was the
bitterest fought contest of their
1935—36 campaign when they cone
plctcly smothered the Blue and White
ﬁve 40—222. The fracas was well-
marked with fouls, every minute be-
ing a bloody one.

This Saturday
memoirs of last
trouncng in mind, the llnrtwick
quintet would ﬁnd victory and
revenge swcct sounding music in their
cars.

Tonight the fast-improving llitrt-
wick squad will be best to the Ithaca
(‘ollcge quintet. Both “Dutch” Lit
Duke and “Hal” Church, two vet
cruns, will iidd new strength to the
Blue and White forces. l.al)ukc, a
('oiqierstown exponent, has recovered
from a football injury and the big
guard will probably see considerable
action against lthaca. it was lia-
llukc's into the Susque-
hanna game last week, in which he
saw action for the first time this
season, that was partially responsible

with the

victory.

Yearling: to Resume
Milne Feud Tonight

The ancient rivalry of State’s
yearling collegiuns and the
Milne high guinea pigs will
break into a rash tonight when
the high schoolers step out again
in their never ceasing effort to
win a basketball game.

John Ryan, Milne’s new coach,
has not announced his squad yet,
but 'I‘aft will probably place at
center while Casey and Walker
tie down the forward berths.
Guards will be. chosen from Sip-
pericy, Beagle and Ilartigan.

The freshman five will prob-
ably play Simmons at center,
Balog and Leggctt as forwards,
and Frament, Quinn or Tattle
at the guarding positions.

Milne high with three wins
is one up on the freshman. They
are, however, the underdogs
through their loss to the fresh-
men earlier iii the season.

A preliminary will be played
between the freshman intramural
team and the Milne jayvees.
Dancing will follow the varsity
game.

Hobart Wins By Single Goal;
Niagara, Buffalo Top State
By Wide Margins

The State college basket tossen
journeyed into the land of the set-
ting sun last weekend to engage the
cage tennis representing Niagara,
Buffalo State, and Hobart, major
opponents all. As a result of an acci-
dent while enroute gameward, and
injuries received in rough contests,
a bruised and battered team took the
floor for the Teachers against each
of’ the enemy squads.

The Niagara university Purple
Eagles, always power-packed, and
conquerors of the Instructors in a
previous game, felled the State five
by a Ali—24 count. The would-be
teachers from the other extremity of
the state, the Buffalo State Bisons,
showed the way the night of Friday,
February 5, by a 40—27 score. The
next night, llobart, after assuming
a big lead during the initial half,
squeezed out a narrow victory, 32—30.

The State squad barely arrived in
time for the Niagara game. They
took the court fresh from an acci-
dent, but were generously accorded
the waiving of all substitution and
time-out rules by the home team.
The halfway tally was 19—9, in
Niagara’s favor, which score repre-
sented n creditable showing on the
part of State. In the second half,
the Roaring Cataracts added another
ten points to their margin, bringing
the score to 44—24 at the ﬁnal
whistle. Byrnes was high man for
State with seven points, while the
Niagara point-getting was divided.

The Buffalo Teachers emerged vic-
torious in the second contest of the
tour, a rough encounter. The flour
city youths led all the way, 17-9 at
the half and 110—27 at the closing
gun. Bancroft and Byrnes each
netted seven points for State, while
Witmeyer was tops for Buffalo with
fourteen.

'l‘lie Hobart game produced the
closest battle of the invasion, Ho-
bart managing to eke out a two-point
win after seeing its big first half
advantage taken away. State was
without spirit during the primary
cliukker, sinking only two field bas-
kets and three t'oul shots for a total
of seven points as arrayed against
twenty t’or llobart. Toward the end
of" the second half", State came within
a point of’ the Genovans at 29—28.
Hobart then tallied a ﬁeld hasth
and foul shot, which Tom Ryan’s
field goal failed to match.
