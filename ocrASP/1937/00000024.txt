teacher who has failed to meet his
student obligation because he con-
siders loyalty to the student group
and a spirit of ready cooperation as
the basis of character.

“Those seniors who wish to have
their applications go to superintend-
ents without predjudice should at
once square their accounts in the
college community. They should
clear these records so that we can
have pride in presenting these records
to inquiring school oﬁicers.

‘ ‘ From this date forward, delin-
quencies will be cumulative from
freshman year on. Seniors of 1937
will be held accountable for senior
year only.

“A good citizen in any community
meets all his community obligations.

“The Student Finance board will
consider special appeals, privately
presented, of those who wish to make
such appeals. The delinquent list is
now in the hands of the Appointment
bureau. It will be corrected from
time to time as payments are made
to the ﬁnance board and to the class
treasurer.”

The new ruling is expected to in-
crease the present 65 per cent student
tax payment and 20—70 per cent class
dues collection. Exemptions for stu-
dents who are ﬁnancially unable to
conform to this rule will be con-
sidered by the Student Board of
Finance. Appeals for exemption will
be privately made through Mr.
Clarence A. Hidley, professor of his-
tory and treasurer of the student
association and the board.
