Civil war is selleduled to rage on
the Page hall eourt tomorrow night.
Graduates will lloek into town to en-

gage the umlergradnates, brolller will

be pitted against; brother, and bitter

will be the bloodshed. 'l‘lle eontesl
should add lung to the festive spirit
that will be pre'ailing this weekend
——.l fitting nigllteap for the Junior
events aml an appropriate prelix to
the gay times attendant upon the ob-
servance of Washington ’5 birthday.

A satellitestudded array of shot-
makers will face the varsity at the
opening gun. 'l‘heir laek of praetiee
this season and their beillg anaeeus-
tolned to each other ’s private taeties
will be more than counlerlnilam-ed by
their experience. Diek .\largison

stellar guard, alld l"rank till, from
way back ill ’15:}, eomplete the known
Alumni squad.

’l‘he lillellp that was so sneeessl'nl
against iiartwiek will probably take
the ﬁeld for the varsity. l‘Intireiy
Sophomore exeepl. for Tom ltyan, a

give them the whip hand ill tomorrow
evening’s tussle.

As the present hoop season nears
its end, several of us, l'arsigbtedly
enough, we like to thilik, begin to
look forward to the next

a successful and highly interesting
basketball season run he looked for-
ward to for the 19157— itilltl season.

Four Sophomores and Junior
Find Winning Stride,
Triumph 50-39

Starting olt’ the new semester with
a ﬂourish, the State quintet stepped
into the high scoring alloy to take a
50—39 will from Iiartlvick. Gleeful
Stale fans saw a team composed of
tour sophomores and one junior jump
into all early lead and give the visitors
a very solid lrouneing.

Tommy Ryan, the junior ﬂash, hit:
the stride whiell he has promised all
season by leading the scoring with
if) points. Following the pace set:
by his nimble lingers, sophomores
Walko, Amyol, Lehman and Hersh-
kowilz played veteran bllll.

During the ﬁrst half, Walko and
Amyot. started the log rolling with
eonnlers which kept Slate far ahead.
Aeenrale passing and shooting
brought State up to a 28—18 lead as
the half eluted,

ill the second period precise team-
work eontinued. iiartwiek, still try-
ing hard, was unable to threaten the
ten point lead piled up by State in
the ﬁrst half“. Captain Pettill, with
a total of 14 points led the Hurt-
wiek seoring eiTort.

The box score for the spree:
