Debate Gets a New Trial
Through Faculty

 

 

Commentstater

 

 

We have been interested by the new plans drawn
up by the English faculty for the preparation of State’s
debaters. Debating, as the art it should be, has long
been decadent, indeed almost extinct, at State. All
impetus has been badly needed; perhaps the re-organi-
nation will prove an aid to both inter-collegiate and
intru-lluii'ai forensic squads.

it seems strange that debating is not more popular
at this college, but quite likely the lack of interest is
us much due to the inadequacy ol’ the speakers as to
tho technical subject matter involved and the general
disinterest shown by the students for ally of the more
intellectual of the extra-curricular activities.

Then too, the assembly debates in late years have
not been of a caliber to arouse any interest among
the students. Insuflicient preparation on the part of
the squads, inappropriate treatment of supposedly
humorous subject matter, and sheer llufl’oonry have led
State’s students to look on extra-mural debate as a
subject for ridicule, and on inter-collegiate debate as
something above their heads.

When members of Debate council have to run about
the corridors of tho college attempting to hunt ilp an
audience for a debate with St. Michael’s, and when,
the following week, it is impossible to discover the
topic ot' the debate, it is tilllc that debating as a
student activity be tile‘Olltllllit'll, or revived.

We sincerely believe in the importance of debate,
and we earnestly hope for its revival as a worthwhile
activity ill the eyes of“ fllc students. Reorganization
sccllls a step ill the right dircctioil.

Why The Alumni Drive?

Alumni residence halls, those to be, ill addi-
tion to the ones now existing, are buildings and
social centers of which the college and its
alumni and students may rightly be proud.
Property on which further buildings may be
constructed is already owned by the Alumni
association.

Classes iii State college from 1918 on, and
individuals from 1929 on, pledged financial aid
and contributed for something from which they
never were to receive material benefit. Wlly
shouldn’t we?

State college vitally needs a men’s dormitory,
a student union, 8. men’s and women’s athletic
house and a swimming pool. Some future build-
ing project which would be supported in this
drive could include some or all of these facilities.

The only way of guaranteeing any or all of
these ends is by the fulfillment of pledges of
those students who make up the ranks of the
college alumni.

if these reasons do not convince you ol’ the
active part you could play in the proposed type
of drive, your suggestions for some new and
more important project which Would benefit
your college and allow for the expressions ol‘
your individual desire to iillprovc it, will be
apprcciatcd.

 

Before The House

At no filnc in the history ol' our dclllocrnlic
form ol' sludcllf scll'-govcl'lllllcllf has a morc
sol-ions pl-oblcnl faced the studcllt body than lln-
one ot' disappearing books from the Library.

During the spring, lllcmbcrs ol' tllc [library
stafl’ wcrc forced to visit the various group
houses to collect as many ol' lllcs‘c l'ol-u'olh-n
books as possible.

The llcudacllo has llol nloppi'tl in any scnsl- ol'

and the privileges which lllf' nlllllf’ills clljoy by
their presence ill this plllcc ol' study urc bclng
abused continuously,

This issue came bcl’ol'c Illc llsscmbly lust \H't‘li.
With the same dcudllcss ol' spirit so chill-actor-
islic ol’ the Friday lllccflngs a motion passed to
supply a student colllmltfco lo cotlpi'l'ulc lo lilo
fullest extent with the faculty colullllflcc,

It is up to the comlililtcc to crystalllxc sill-
dcilt opinion in a llulss protest against the
people who have not been playing thc calm»
fairly.

Canute’s Corner

Venom

C.N. M.

Traditional rivalry, not time-
honored but blessed on both sides
with a keen alma mater complex

 

coming from adjacence and social in-

terrelationship, not dripping with ivy
juice but with a suddenly-wrought,
amicable, venom, not evoking world-
wide interest but meaning everything
to the Troy and Albany institutions,
comes to a head for the second time
this season when RPI meets State
on the Page hall court this evening.
A full house and team support
bordering fanaticism can he promised
with impunity.

Oil one of tile seven hills of Troy
stands Rcussclucr Polytechnic insti-
tute, the oldest engineering school
ill the United States. The body stu-
dent is entirely illule uud dormitory
housed. A review of their athletic
prowess would ferret out swimming
as their most successful sport. cht
iii lillc, though, in a general survey,
would come buskclbull. This year's
team nipped us lift—:37, ill our open-
ing contest. A little later, they
nosed out Williams, who later bowcd
to l'l‘illcctoll only alter the closest
of battles.

Captain and veteran forward of
the Engineers, Elia " Ace " Levonian
is probably the most formidable of
the enemy. Paired with him at for-
ward will be Tommy Fellows, another
experienced man. The defense wall
will include Ward and Safford, fine
defense men and scoring threats. At
center, Gilcoyne, of last year’s squad
will probably get the call. His
recent recovery from an early injury
has added greatly to team strength.
The squad is backed by capable re-
serves and a new scoring threat un-
covered against Union, Faziola, a
sophomore.

Oldest among the tcuching lllstl
tutions ol' the stutc and tln- only
college lll lllc Slates til'\'tlli‘fl solely
to the training of secondary school
teachers, our school bus nevertheless
taken a strong liking to and illtcl'cst
lll basketball. Still, athletically
speaking, we have always been the
underdogs ill the eyes ol' the Capital
District inns. 'l‘onigllt ltl’l returns
our earlier visit to them, full of
sound alld buy. We ul'c sci. to show
ourselves as we l'cully iti'l‘, to spend
the full force of ollr power on them.

Since meeting RPI, much water
has passed under the bridge. Tucked
away among a plurality of losses
were victories over Norwich and
Toronto. The squad is now rldlng
on the rather shaky crest of a two
game winning streak, composed of
victories over llartwick and the
Alumni. Our losses to Brooklyn
Poly and Pratt wclc by smaller
scores than those by which RPI lost
to the some teams. And Nol‘wn'h
holds a victory over Mltldlt‘lnll'y, who
beat RPI—all of which
nothing.

Alumni 
Bowstity

Murray And T. Ryan Are
High Scorers

When the State courtsters met their
strong Alumni five on the Page hall
court last Saturday night, a wild
scramble ensued that saw brothers
pitted against brothers, tie—captain
against co-captain, a former captain
against former captains, and brother
with brother; aild after four hectic
ten-minute periods the final whistle
blew with the undergraduates emerg-
illg victor by virtue of a 40—34 count.

From the very outset of the fracas
it was apparent that the Alumni was
out for blood; and well supported by
a throng of grads, tllcy displayed fre-
quent spurts of their renowned ability
which has marked them “baskcteers.”

Couch Hatfield used two separate
quintcts in the contest with his
newly-formed winning combination,
consisting of four sophomores and a
junior, taking the floor. The under-
graduates swung oil' to all early lead
ulld with tile count 11—6, the Hatfield
all-senior five entered the game. The
grads begun to bear down and with
lllgriuli and Murray setting the pace
they retaliated to place the contest in
a L’U~—L’t) deadlock at halftime.

ill the final half, State “shot the
works” with Tom Ryan and Mike
Walko making good their shots from
the field to give the Hatfield aggrega—
tion ll 36—26 advantage. The grads
fought guiller but fruitlesst in the
final minutes as the undergraduates
coasted through to victory.

Saturday’s fracas saw nine ol’ the
undergraduate squad scoring from the
field with Tom Ryan, playing from a
guard position, capturing scoring
honors for his tcaln. Murray and
“Dick” Margison with ten alld nine
points respectively claimed scoring
luurcls for the grads. Roger Ban-
crot’l, captain aild nucleus of the 1934
quintet, was held scoreless as were
many of the other grads who were
obviously lost ill the shufﬂe.
