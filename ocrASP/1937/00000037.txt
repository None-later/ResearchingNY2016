Sayles Attends Conferences
For Research Workers
And Principals

 

lleau Milton (l. Nelson and Pro-
t'cssor John M. Sayles, principal of
Milne High school and head of the
appuiuluu-lli bureau this week ro-
lurncd from New Orleans, where they
had represented State college at. the
annual convention ol’ the National
l‘fducation assm-iation.

ll(':lll Nelson presided ovcr a forum
ot‘ the department of superintendence.
on the topic, “Problems Facing
.v\dull l-Iducalion”, aml also attended
meetings of’ the national department
ot' secondary school principals and of
the :‘liiicrimll educational research
association. l’rot'cssor Sayles ut-
lcmlcd meetings ot' the association of
stu'unllul'y school principals and took
part in a forum for the discussion ol.’
the llcporl ot' the (,‘onnnittce on the
()ricntation ot' Secondary Education.

Many educators took part in the
discussions at the convention. Dean
William linsscll, ot' the teacher’s col-
lege. t'olumbia university, struck the
kcy nolc ot' the group when he warned
against haste in in l l‘ od u c i n g
"l'topias” as a remedy for social
evils. He stated that a procedure
such as this would play right into the
hands ot' the extremists. As a sug-
gcslcd means ot' dealing with the
bringing about ot' desired changes, he
advocnlcd “education for the middle
of the road".

()thcr rel'orms

 

suggested by
speakers at the convention were
many. 'l'cucliers were urged to con-
duct more research work. They were
told that. they too must. take up ro—
scarch nn-lhods rather than plodding
along in n drudge-likc. fashion.

Am her suggestion was that. schools
introduce courses in safe automobile
driving. 'l‘his, it was cited, might
uid greatly in reducing the frightful
loll that automobich have been tak~
ing in injuries and fatalities among
thc youth ot' our country.

 

'l‘hc nccd for critical parents was
also stressed at the convention. In
connection with this, the diehard
teachers were attacked as being the
type that such criticism would aid in
