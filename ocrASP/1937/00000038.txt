Is Consolidation the Answer
To the Problem?

Last week’s assembly debate brought into the
open one of State’s moot questions. The pro-
posal to consolidate the Echo and the Lion has
been a live topic of discussion in many quarters
this week.

The muckraking presented in the debate was
to a large degree excellent. We ask the ques-
tion, however. if the criticism constructivelj.‘
proved that the answer to present faults in the
publications will be found in consolidation.

Syracuse and Hamilton have tried the com-
bination of literary and humor magazines, and
the result was regarded by critics at home and
abroad as a hodgepodge of material which was
neither literary nor humorous. The problems
of a consolidated magazine therefore may be
worthy of extended study if they are to bc prac-
tically considered.

The Lion and the Echo can each well ali’ord
to think about the suggestions ol‘ their critics
as to content and make-up. ’l‘he Echo's advance
this year is to be commended; both of the pub-
lications can be improved. All of which makes
us inquire again il’ there is not a real place for
two magazines at State ('ollege, one literary and
one humorous.

The Debate Question
Stands Clariﬁed

Last lt‘riday‘s debate assembly clariticd the
position of debate at State college for the whole
student association, includng responsible critics
and those who know nothinu' about the debate
set-up at all.

Mr. llardy's outline in assembly indicated
that debate is on the npg‘radcw-uot “out ol' the
dinnps,” for debate has been on the upgrade
for some time.

The new plan for a two year course in debate
has a three-fold purpose which should correct
faults in the present arrangement. The pur-
poses arc (l) to provide students with a bcllcl'
knowledge ol' the lhcory ol' dcbulc. IL’; to pro-
vide debaters \vilb buckc‘round in the social and
eitonomic all'airs which they will be tll\t'll\~lll:_",
and (ll) to give practice in debate cmti'lliliu‘. The
ruling that eligibility l'or varsity debut:- will be
based on participation in these classes is a tor.
ward step.

We notice other signs ol' upgrade in debate.

debaters must come. from the \nrsily squad will
all'ord better l’orcnsic ability. Une for
poor assembly debates in the past is that "cu-ry-
body was given a chance" to participate in
them, and the result was often not the selection
of debaters but at anyone who bud the time to
prepare a speech.

Letters of Application

[The NEWS presents the second of a series of articles
emanating from the Appointment bureau for the in-
formation of seniors and graduate students looking for
teaching positioned

Many teachers are hired by letters of application, but
it seems that in New York State the personal interview
is superseding letters. llcur in mind, therefore, when
you write letters of application, that your ﬁnal aim is to
secure an interview if possible. In writing, remember
that you do stand a chance for the position. .\lake every
effort to secure it. Write it with that attitude; con-
struct the best letter you can; it is your method of in-
troduction; and it may reveal yourself to your employer.

Rules for writing application letters include:

I. Plain paper, or else your own stationery, 81/2; by
11. Typewrite. Letter should not exceed one page in
length. lnclosc a self~:uldrcsscd stamped envelope. To
give the principal or superintendent a sample of your
handwriting, it might be a good idea to address the

 

 

return envelope in longhand. Typewritc the letter,
remember, but sign it in ink over your typewritten

 

 

t

 

name. .
2. If your lead on the position comes from the Ap-
pointment bureau, mention the fact. Refer to the deli-
uitc position that you are applying for.

3. lie tactful. Don’t ask questions about salary, the
town, or rules of the school board. Wait until you are
elected.

4. Every letter of application should be an entirely
new one—write to each principal as individually as pos-
siblc. Look up the location of the town, and get any
facts about it that you can.

Mr. W. Hardy Proposes
New Forensic Managers

A new system for intercollegiate
debating in State college was an-
nounced by Mr. William G. Hardy,
debate coach, in assembly last week.
This method calls for a concentration
by debaters on two or three dclinitc
issues of the day, and also the elec-
tion of special debating courses to be
worked into the curriculum.

The new plan as worked into the
curriculum will embody more train-
ing and application to debuting
theory and speaking, a better under-
standing.r of the social and economic.
problems of the day, and study and

practice in coaching high school
debating.
.\s to intercluss debating, .\lr.

llardy advised that each class appoint
a debate manager to nnmagc more
cliiciently this activity. He urged
that there be less “buck passing"
less blastng criticism, and more re-
sponsiblity on the part of the indi-
vidual. While debate council will be
the advisory body for Intramural dc-
buting, the real responsibility will
lie with the classes themselves.

State’s Stage

Negro Play Well Chosen
Unusual Makeup

 

 

 

Sophistication
I’LAYGOI‘IH
A Week ago Tuesday Advanced

Dranmtics once again gave us a taste
of what they can do. The sets showed
a lack of originality—we are espe-
cially tired of the center fireplace
with the ship on the mantel. 'l‘hc
make-up, however has improved.

The ﬁrst play of the evening was
well chosen. We realize that some of
the parts were mistrust; but it was a
good attempt. liuth Sinovoy is a find.
She presented a. deﬁnite character in
every minute at” her performance, hcr
movements were spontaneous, and her
reactions natural. . . . We Were sorry
about 'l‘om Kelly. He has done many
excellent roles, but his negro character
was a letdown. llis movements were
too quick and jerky. He tried, but
didn't succeed in giving us a con-
vineinp‘r negro character. . . . 'l‘ho lirst.
stage appearance of .\larjoric tirist
was a pleasure. She showed some of
the usual ﬁrst, appearance l'nults, but
gave us a real negro accent, and ex-
cellent clmrm'tcrization. Her hands
were soon-times :'.t a loss, but try

 

again, .\lnrjorie. . . . Perhaps Lillian
()lson was very old, but her voice
seemed much too high and strained,
and hardly that cl’ a dying woman.
llcr make-up was unusual and well
done, but Lillian didn't livt up to it.
Shc was a little of n dis:qqmintmcnt.

'l'hc sccond play was lab-resting,
but not an unusual presentation.
When it was over wc \vcrc Ict't :1 bit
dubious, I'm-ling,r [but everyone could
lm\c donc bulb-r than he did to make
a more succcsst'ul play. . . . Jeanne
l'hryslci' did :Ig‘c overnight, both in
manner, voice, and movcuu-nl. She
was at ease during,r the whole play,
and we \vcre pleased with her pres-
cntntion ot' the modern mother. . . .
ictty .\ppeldoorn schm-d uneasy at
times, especially when sln' sat on tho
davcnporl with Jean. llcr make-up
should lmvc given us an older woman
*hcr young, am not

much clnulcc l’or imlividuulism. She
played it quite well, but she needs
