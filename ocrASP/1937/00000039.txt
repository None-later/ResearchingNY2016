WHAT Fred McDaniel {below} says about Camels is
backed up100% by baseball's “Iron Man,”laou Gehrig
—by Frank Buck, of "Bring 'Em Back Alive” fame—by
Eleanor Tennsnt, the outstanding woman tennis coach
of the U.S.—and by millions of other Camel smokers in
all walks of life. Enjoy Camels at every meal. They speed I
up the ﬂow of digestive ﬂuids. Increase alkalinity. Help
you enjoy food. Camels set you right! They’re ll» cigarette
for steady smoking. Light up a Camel and get a "lift."
