STATE COLLEGE NEWS, FRIDAY, MARCH 12, 1937

Two Athletic Groups

Varsity Defeats Bard
For Fifth Straight Win

 

RPI and St. Michael’s Bow
To Powerful Sophomore
Combination

 

By ‘claiining victory over ll. l'. L,
St. Michaels, and llard in their last
three engagements, the State cagers
have made it ﬁve straight; and a
titling epitaph to their ltlilti-Il'i cam
paign would be a win from llartwick
tomorrow night in their final contest
of the current season.

It was (.‘0ach llattield’s “Sopho-
more” quintet, who, having hung up
two consecutive victories for State,
proved their worth in emerging vic~
torious in their past three engage-
ments. The able assistance ot' the
seniors, however, was felt iii all ot'
these fracases.

A highly-touted it. 1’. l. team, who
had previously lost a narrow 1-point
victory to a powerful Union Sqtliitl,
invaded J'age Hall on l“ebruar_v :16
to be routed 36-217 by the Purple and
(told angers. llevenge was sweet for
State after having lost a hard-fought
battle to the l'ingineers earlier in the
season.

(._‘oaeli Donald started his second
string live against llattield's “Sopho-
more” quintet only to he forced to
replace them by the tirst stringers
after six minutes ot' play. leile took
a 15-13 edge at halftime and for the
lirst l‘.’ minutes of the second stanza
the Purple and (.lold quintet took coin
pletc control of the fracas to put tlu.
game “on ice.”

Let hy ('aptaiu “Ace” Levonian
and Quincy (lilcoyiie the lioinihhnen
made a strong bid for victory; but
the massive lead which the 'l‘eachcrs,

 

having followed the example ot':

(ieorge .\inyot and 'l'oniniy ll_\aii. had
accumulated pro\ed too great to In
overcome.

The followingr night Htate tei'ini
nated its home season hy handing a

powerful Ht. .\lichacls qniiitet a its 25‘ ‘

setback. Once again it \\as llattield’s
“.\‘tqihoniore” quintet that look the
tloor against the Vermonters, but out
wardly slowed by their hard fought
game of the previous night, they went
into a stamp to he on the short end
of a llvil count at midpoint ot’ the
ﬁrst frame. 'l'licy rallied, however, to

give the well seasoned .\t'llitll'h‘ an Men ,

Hartwich ls Last F oe
Of Teacher Quintet

It’s all over tomorrow night
for this year’s basketball squad.
The team has rides to ()neonta
to trade tield baskets with the
llartwick cagers in the closing
game of the season.

When the purple and gold bat-
tled the Lutheran college on the
night of lt‘ehruary lit on the
Page hall court, a ﬁll—Jill victory
for the teachers was the result.
'l‘hat marked the beginning ot' a
winning streak for the h‘tate
team which now includes live
victories.

The return of Jlartwick ‘s
regular center to action. and
memory of last year‘s reversal
on their court combine to point
to a closely contested game.

sporadic successes with a line triumph
over the RH. freshmen and 'athcr
disappointing losses to Amsterdam

neither of these two games were they
in their best playing fettlc.

even. They lost L'T—L’tl on December

loss with a 32-27 triumph. \\'ith
