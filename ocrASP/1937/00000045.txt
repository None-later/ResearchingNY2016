How Time ﬂies! We have scarcely

there are 95~count them days to

[a If you want to see a basketball
player get. angry iisk George it he
believes in signs. . . . Judging from
his ‘scenc’ Inst 'li‘riday he dislikes
them, at. least. . . . Freshman may not
believe in the signs urging Sophs to
attend song practice, hht they remove
them just the same. . . . 'l‘o coiieliule
our talk ill sign language, a lordly
graduate student asked what A'lflt
means on the Draper hall Soiree sign.
. . . Knowledge is pow'ci'—-ni'c we horse
or male? . . . we’re being subtle.

The recent ﬂurry of delicate white

another epidemic of bunny pants.
Have you women no vanity? . . . And
how did the snow get in the Activi-

Don’t tell me that you dislike to have
vour taco washed? . . . 'l‘he dorm

employed by him heret‘t ot‘ fam-
ily, i‘riend, ainl tiiiaiiee. It
scldoin tails. 'l‘lie dime furth-
coming, the victim receives a
myslci'ious note which is thrust
into his dinic lcas hand.

“This dimc will be used to
help ship a cargo of males to the
Holy Land. Don’t be an ass-~-
pass this along ainl get your dimc
back the way i did.”
