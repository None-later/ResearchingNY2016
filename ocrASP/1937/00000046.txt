What To Do With
The Point System

Lack of correct knowledge of parliamentary
procedure on the part of the student body and
lack of sufficient data on the part of the point
system committee certainly made the last stu-
dent assenibly program one of the most hectic
and futile we have seen.

The student body was alert in t'OllSltli'l'IllL’ the
committee ‘5 report. but its procedure was faulty
and dilatory. The correct procedure for any-oin-
disagreeing with an item on the report is first
to question the committee,
not satisfying. move that the item in question
he reconimit‘ted for further investigation, Mo-
tions from the ﬂoor to change directly an item
of the report are out of place in view of thc

fact that the committee is operating on a
formula already approved by the student
assembly.

The point system coiiimittcc did a fine job in
averaging the discrepancies between last year's
point valuations and this year‘s cstiinaics Ill
order to arrive at a final evaluation. W:- lch
however. that tlic lack of sufficient data
thwarted their purpose l’iii'i of this blame lies
with the student body for ll\ l'ailiii'c to till out

Student Tax Payments Reach
Only 71% of Budget Requirement

 

Many Students Unable to Pay;
Class Dues Collections
Make Increase

 

By Charles Ettinger

In spite of the largest student tax
payment in i'ccoill years, the funds
available for all college activities
amount to only 71% of this year ‘s
budget. Approximately 8017, of the
undergradutc student body has piiid
the tax.

As usual, the eagerness to
varied inversely with seniority. Sixty
seniors have not yet paid. This means
thui. unless those seniors are exempted
by thc Financi- IIonrd because they
are financially unable to meet the obli-
giition, they will not receive :in nu
biased i'cconinieiidniion for it teach

of juniors have dct'iiultcd, whllc the

Commentstater

\Vitli discretion relegated to the winds, and courage
in our heart, we rise to protest the attacks of llit'
l'ltilltil'nlilt‘ Fiorcllo ll. LtiGuai‘diti, Mayor of New York,
on Incuhrer I-litler, Rcichs president and inipci'iitor.

Not that we disagree with the Mayor. From what
we have heard Ilitlcr deserves Iiiin place in a hall of
horrors. We think the whole idea is one of the best
commentaries on dictators we have seen, and we have
read “It Can’t Happen Here." But still no score
the Mayor’s liorscpliiy.

The core oi" our protest has to do with the major
event of twenty years ago this week, namely Anicrican
entrance into Europe's war. And more specifically. with

At any rate, from August b' on, practically all the

C. N. M.

’Way back in pre-Easter times oc-
curred the gala sequence of athletic
activity which was hailed on poster
and sandwich sign alike as the sports
carnival. It was perhaps a little long
with the schedule possibly a little
overpacked with evants. All things
considered, though, the evening's pro-
gram was a success.

Volley hiiII competition was some—
wlmt hick-lustre because of unfamili-
arity on the purl of the players with
the tenets of the game. The tumblers
showed to advantage.
throuin ii variety of paces with coili-
lllt'lNlilIiIt' agility and good humor.
l’uddle tennis and boxing nc.\l held
sway, with

otl'ering's. Hky-hig'h \ollcys llllll‘Ki'll

aler prcccdcil ilic intci‘si-xual court

The girls won, heck. Of course.
the men were handicapped by having
to play under girls' rules; but no
well-founded alibi for the defeat has
been garnered. Fitting climax to the
night’s entertainment was the sopho-
more—freshman rivalry game, which
event the second year men captured
45—19. The game was one of the best
we have had the pleasure to witness,
and hard-fought, inception to close.
