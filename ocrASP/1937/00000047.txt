E‘ ect Army of Men
Aﬁngle Fashion Show

I-Iurryl Hurryi I-Iarryi Hurryi
If you want to see a State girl
in a 1900 bathing suit and other
accessories, and other attractions
as well, take a run up to the
Y.W.C.A. fashion show, April
24, in the Ingle room of the
Alumni Residence hall.

Everybody’s welcome, and, for
the ﬁrst time, even the fellows
are invited. The girls ﬁgured
that possibly a group of their
own sex would be rather preju-
diced, but with the men coming,
they can be sure of an unbiased
view on the latest in silks and
satins, from State’s connois-
seurs of femininity.

Betty IIayford, ’39, is chair-
man of the show, and Eloise
Shearer, ’37, is to be mistress of
ceremonies. The outfits to be
exhibited are from David’s,
North Pearl street.

The show will present prcvncs
of past fashions as well as those
of most recent date. Clothes
practical for the college girl will
be emphasized in the display.

 

 

Name Four to Dean's List

Four additional students have been
named to the Dean’s list, according
to an announcement by Elizabeth Van
Denburgh, registrar. They include
two seniors, one sophomore, and one
freslnnan: Ilerbert Adler and
Minnie (leorgell', seniors; Ruth
liutler, ’39; and Carolyn Brignola,
’40.

Everybody enjoys refreshing mild-
ness in a cigarette . . . everybody
likes good taste and pleasing aroma.

These are the things that make
smoking a pleasure.

For all the good things that smok-

ing can give you we invite you
to enjoy Chesterﬁeld Cigarettes.

At the end of three weeks of in»

dent of the class of 1937, reports that

The committcc, appointed by Mar-
gisou, general chairman of the drive,
to draw up resolutions to present to
the Alumni association for suggested
use of the funds plcdgcd, has reported
that the lirsi olI_jccli\‘c will be a

Sophomores Present
Novel Dance Programs

In 1917 a war-time spirit in-
vaded State college, and it was
announced that in order to con-
form lo the nation-wide frugality,
we would dispense with dance
programs except for Senior ball,
and all refreshments excepting
punch. The latter rule has be-
come' almost traditional, but with
the Armistice the dance programs
returned. It would seem that
good times are here to stay from
the sophisticated black and silver
programs that the Sophomores
arc distributing for Soiree.

With the advent of big-name
orchestras and more elaborate
preparations, State is achieving
quite a reputation for outstand-
ing dances, even among the larger
and better-known colleges.
