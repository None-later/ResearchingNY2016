r .. . In Unusual Debate"-

Forensic Squad to Encounter
Cornell, Keuka On Trip

An unusual round table debate on
the subject of regulating minimum
wages and maximum hours was con-
ducted in the Lounge of Richardson
hall on Wednesday. The meeting
was in charge of Mr. Jones, instruc-
tor of English, who acted as chair-
man.

The debate was scheduled as a
formal, no decision, debate, but as
the debaters chatted over the dinner
table the idea of a round table de-
bate was presented to the teams and
as Hobart had never debated this

style before they decided that they?

would like to experiment with it.

A feature of Hobart’s debate squad
was their mascot, Paix, who is a
German collie dog who has been
trained by the Seeing Eye to guide
the blind. His master was Fred-
erick Newman who, although blind,
showed that he pOssessed an analytical
mind for the problems of the subject,
and the ability to catalog 0. huge
number of facts in his mind without
the aid of any written notes.

The Hobart team, which was to de-
bate Skidmore last night, consisted
of George Hull, captain, Samuel
Warr, seniors, Sidney Brown, ’38, and
Fred Newman, ’39.

The State team was composed of
Gordon Tabner and Edgar O’Hara,
sophomores.

A State debate squad will make
a trip to Cornell and Keuka college
over the weekend. This squad will
consist of Jean Lichcnstein, Florence
Zubres, Lizette Parshall, juniors,
Leonard Fricdlandcr, and Lawrence
Strattncr, sophomores. This squad
will debate the problems of minimum
wages and maximum hours, and also
the problem that the 0.1.0. should

Feasting and Frolic
Marks Senior Banquet

Yoicksl Yoicksl and the
seniors feasted at their “ April
showers” banquet Wednesday in
the Cafeteria. The aﬁ‘air turned
out to be a regular reunion of
the class with dancing in the
Commons and group singing in
the Activities Oilice following the
festivities. Messrs. Edwards and
DeSerio led the choristers in their
impromptu roundclay.

Speakers of the evening were
Drs. French and Tommie, who
delivered “The Saga of Little
Orphan Willie,” a story based
on their early adventures.

A typical ’37 skit, directed by
Evvie Hamann, finished off the
entertainment. It seemed to
have been planned as a take-off
on the stunt of the sophomores
a few weeks back, and succeeded
handsomely.

Stars of the piece were the trio
composed of Edwards, Erwin, and
DeScriO, with their classical
renditions. Even the NEWS had
a place in the skit, perched
above the rounded head of George
Mackie.

 

Seniors To Order Gowns
Seniors who wish to rent cap and
gowns for Moving Up Day until corri-
mcncement may obtain them from
Virginia Loucks, Margaret Roots, or
Frederick Byrncs, seniors.
If they wish to purchase the caps
and gowns they may be obtained
from the Co-op at a special price.

 

To Assess Five Dollar Tax

For the beneﬁt of the entering
members of the student association
for the second semester, the Student
Board of Finance decided at their
regular meeting Tuesday that the
new students will be entitled to all
the privileges of the student tax upon

 

be extended to all industries.

the payment of live dollars.

TWO LEADERS OF CLASS OF 1939

 

Dunton Tynan and John Edge, prominent in sophomore affairs. Edge
is class president, and Tynan is secretary of the student associih
tion. Tynan was president Of the class in his freshman year.

 

Classical Club To Have
Annual Buffet Supper

Classical club will conduct a buli‘et
supper in the Lounge of Richardson
hall, Thursday at 6:00 o’clock, ac-
cording to an announcement by
Dorothy Ostrandcr, ’37.

Faculty guests of the club will in-
clude: Miss Virginia Smith, super-
visor in French; Miss Edith Wallace,
assistant professor of Latin; Miss
Marion Chescbrough, instructor in
Latin; and Miss L. Antoinette John-
son, assistant professor and supervisor
of Latin.

A poster has been placed on the
main bulletin board, and all who de-
siro to come are asked to sign up as
soon as possible. The affair is an

 

annual one, the social highlight of
the club season.

 

State To Debate Wells
The next home debate of State’s
forensic squad will be Wednesday
with Wells college. The subject is,
“Resolvedz—that Congress should be
empowered to Regulate minimmn
wages and maximum hours.”

 

Nominees Post“ Signs
As Part of Campaign

Another phase of the new plan for
opening up elections at State college
took the form of the posters which
have been placed during the week:
throughout the college buildings.

“This is just another step to let
the members of the student associa-
tion know about the qualifications of
the various candidates. it is in no
way to be a competition in artistic
ability,” maintains Charles Gaylord,
chairman of the newly appointed
Election commission.

At. the meeting Monday noon in
which the candidates and their mana»
gcrs received their instructions from
the commission, scparate places were
assigned for the posters of the three
major officers for next year. Those-
of the president are on the main bul-
letin board Of Draper hall. The
campaign posters for the vice-presi-
dency are located near the mail box,
and those for the office of secretary
of the student body are on the bul—
lctin board in I'lustcd hall.
