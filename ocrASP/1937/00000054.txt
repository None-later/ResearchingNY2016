Team Next Week

Home Game Saturday Is First
Of Two With Engineer
Baseballers

 

A week from tomorrow the llallield
hitters will clash v ith R.P.l., in what
promises to be a real traditional
battle, and State will be out to avenge
two dct’cats handed them last spring
by the Engineers.

A game was on the verge of being
scheduled for tomorrow afternoon
with Manhattan college, Staten
Island branch. Beverwyck park is
still the home ﬁeld ot’ the Purple atnl
Gold, pending the completion ot' grail-
ing activities on the Alumni Resi-
dence lield.

Coach llatlield in this, his ﬁrst
baseball season at State, has been
severely handi'apped by the loss ot'
live regulars from last season, tour
of whom played the iiilield. llat~
field has been forced to rely t’or
“punch” upon the diminutive but
fast. t'reslnnen to ﬁll these massive
gaps left by l'aptain .lerry .\mon,
a four-year veteran ot’ the initial sa k,
Earl llutchcr, who saw plenty ot' in
tion on the keystone base last spi tl;_',,
“‘ Ike" ()lmstead, a real Hptll‘lipll'g at
shortstop, Ray Lynch, a ulilitv man
on tltc “hot " corner, and Mo Quig»
Icy, veteran outﬁelder.

'l‘he veterans returning from last
season are (‘aptain Johnny l'ullen, :ice
twirler boasting three years experi-
ence, Johnny llyan, a roamer ol' the
clover for the past two seasons,
Johnny ()’l’.rien, last year's hack
stop, ’l‘ommy Ryan, iililily man for
the past two seasons, lt'runk Qual-
lrochi, who proved a valuable man at
second last spring, .\like l‘ynibalak,
a worthy siihstititle tor the keystone
combination, and l’anl Nclunitz, a
veteran monnilsman boasting an envi
able record.

("ouch llatlichl hopes to present an
iinpregnable del'ciisive for this, the
opening game, despite the diminutive
grearlings that will he sprinkled
through the inlield, it even average
liitliiig ability is attained, success
might well be the reward.

The game’s starting nine will un
doubleilly he: 'l'ommy Ryan at tirsl,
hurry lalog on the keystone such.

C. N. M.

Oﬂ'hund, just what concept does
the term “MAA” conjure up in the
mind of the average male who rooms
the halls of this teacher-training in-
stitution? It is probably the opinion
of at least half of the masculine stu-
dent group that the title includes six
or seven men who have as their charge
the management of State college
athletics.

 

 

 

'l‘hc feudal age is over; our ath-
letic government is not that of an
oligarchy. The Men’s Athletic Asso-
ciation includes every man in the
college. The Athletic Council is that
group who serve their respective
classes in matters athletic. In the
hands of the council rests the man-
agerial function; in the laps of the
students, the 'arrying out; of the
program.

What we are urging is, obviously,
more cooperation. When the call goes
out for signers-up t'or intramural
sports, need there be hesitancy on
the part of the students? No. And
signing up for a sport should not be
as perfunctory a duty as it is con—
sidered by some. Signature means
willingness to cooperate to the full
with the requirements for partici-
pation.

Niagara Next Year?

At last week's publishing ot' the
basketball schedule. no mention was
made of Niagara as an opponent.
As yet. the potent l’urple Eagles have
not been signed up: but. dickcrings
are on, and it is hoped that the (‘iitit-
raet (‘ity team will again grace olir
schedule.

Track Meet.

As is qiiile custonuiry and nice,
the interelass tract meet will attract;
much attention and draw a large
licld ot' entrants this year. The
events will he run, thrown. and

be the best conditions existent ill
the short history of the ,iamboree.
