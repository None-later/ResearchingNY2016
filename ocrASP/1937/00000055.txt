Trehanon Urges Student Body
To Observe Library Regulations

By David Smith

“During the past few years, State
students have lapsed noticeably in
observing the rules of library eti-
quette,” said Alfred Trchnnon, ’38,
chairman of the student library com-
mittee, in a recent. interview. “To
the average student rushing in and
out of the library, its privileges have
become something to take for granted,
and its rules, something to ignore.”

The library, a place primarily for
reference work and serious study, has
become so noisy of late, that many
students have had to ﬂee the distrac-
tions of the place to some secluded,
vacant classroom in order to concen-
trate on their work. Students should
remember that the library is not the
place to visit with friends; the Com-
mons serves this purpose. However,
there is no need to snub onc’s friends
in the library, but there is still less
need to hold a rendezvous across the
book of someone trying to study.

One school library solved the prob-
lem of unnecessary noise, by hanging
up a sign on which was printed in
large letters, “'l‘.N.T.“ Whenever a
student was out of order, the librarian
pointed to this sign. Student opinion
was divided as to whether the letters

meant, “Talk, Not Think,” or
“Tcte-a-tetc, Not Tolerated.” Any-
how, the sign get results.

Trohanon made the following gen-
eralizations to be seriously considered
by the student body:

A book taken from the library with-
out being chcekcd at the desk, is, as
far as the library is concerned, lost,
and a new one has to be purchased.
Even if the book has been put back
on the shelf a few (lays later, money
lms unnecessarily been spent.

Books should not be underlined or
defaced in any way. Tearing articles
or pages from a magazine, newspaper,
or book, necessitates buying a new
copy.

As for stolen books, volumes are
still disappearing from the library.
Money spent for replacements is using
up funds granted by the State for
other library uses. Besides perpetra-
tiug a criminal act, the student body
is the loser.

The library staff and the library
facility connnittee need the coopera-
tion of each member of the student
body. The student library committee
is serving as the medium of exchange,
between the faculty and the students,
of library problems.

ing conventions of their groups within

placed to the left. of the student mail-
box in Draper hall.
