The “Senators” of State

The initial game of 1937 baseball seems to
predict a successful season for the State men
if they continue to play the “ heads-up ” base-
ball that was witnessed at Blcecker stadium
last Saturday. At this time we feel a just bit
of praise may not come amiss t0 the Purple
and Gold diamond men, and may add a bit
more incentive to a continued successful season.

We also point with pride to the increased
number of enthusiastic supporters who availed
themselves of the opportunity to enjoy the
game, and also commend the Men’s athletic
association for the excellent choice of a ﬁeld
which made it possible for spectators to wit-
ness a State college baseball game from
bleachcr seats instead of the sod hammocks ol'
Ridge-field park. And from the playcrs’ angle,
diamond conditions were at an optimum, a
fact which served even more to accentuate the
success of the season’s opener.

The ’37 baseball season appears at its
brightest now, and to those students who
missed up on the R. P. T. game, our only com-
ment is . . . be sure to be on hand to see the
Pratt contest tomorrow. State collcgc’s b 'and
of our national sport oitcrs an exceptional op-
portunity to see collcgc bascball at its bcst.
We feel confident the hickory will ring up the
runs again tomorrow.

For A Successful Motion,
Congratulations

Last Friday thrcc weeks of cniiipnigniiig, capably
controlled by the election commission, came to a close
as the assembly ciist the final ballots for the student
association candidates. And with this clcctioii, came
to a close also the trial of State’s ncwcst cxpcrimcnt in
student democracy. May we congratulate the commis-
sion and pronounce the i-xpcrinicnt a success.

When Lcstcr Rubin, ’37, first introduced his motion,
designed to “opcn up elections” in State collcge, it
was viewed with n gciicrnl suspicion natural for any-
thing so iittci'ly dill’crcnt t'rom prcccilcnt. C(illSUl'Vil-
tivcs felt that a commission was being: crcntcd cm-
powcrcil with too much authority. But upon close
examination, lhc motion was found to be csscntinlly 'lll
cll'ort to bring to Slntc collcgc a systcm ol' publicizing
student association -andidalcs already in use in the
gi'cntcr majority of Amcrican colleges. l)cbatc on the
subject rngcil from tho lowly lloors ot' lllc lockcr room
to thc lot'ty hcights ot' the rostrum in l’ngi- hall; and
wlicn the motion liiiiilly mum to n votc, :i wcaiicil
:isscmbly volcil an ovcrwhclming “nyc”.

With (‘lnirlcs (inyloril iit thc hclm, lhi- commission
swung into its dutics ot' rcgulaiing llic i-aiiipiiigii :ic-

the ch-clion campaigns of this ycnr wi-rc ihc most l’illl'
