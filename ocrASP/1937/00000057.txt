THE delightful effect of smoking Camels with your

meals and afterwards has been proved again and
again in the great laboratory of human experience.
Explorers, champion athletes, people in hazardous out-
door work, as well as millions of men and women in
homes and oﬁoes, ﬁnd that Camels get digestion of to a
good start and make the perfect ending to ameal.When
you enjoy Camels, you are rewarded with an increased
ﬂow of digestive ﬂuids—alkaline digestive ﬂuids—so
important to good digestion. And you can enjoy Camels
as often as you like! Camels don’t get on your nerves.
