Golfers Commence
First Tournament

As summer softened up the fair-
ways and sandtraps of Albany‘s mtl-
iiicipal golf course, several of State's
golf devotees have. slipped away for
a swing at the little white pellet.
The golf tournament. after all the.
stick swingers who were loose were
signed up and matched, has already
been started, and the. enthusiasts who
have entered are out getting into
shape.

’l‘wo of the games listed have been
played. llcrshkowitz has defeated
Sam Coppolino, one tip, :iiid passes,
because of a bye in the second round,
into the third bracket. Dc Russo
got away to an early start in his game
of tricks. and left lirooks standing up
to the time of 7-5.

l)‘;\gostiti(). a grad. and ex Alabama
l'nivcrsity champion took a practice
,litlll‘l around thc course and ended
up with a score of 78. D'Agostino,
it seems. is going to come out sonic-
whcrc iicar the top. A new ex-
i'luitllp, however. should give him
plenty of competition. We have no
actual scores to quote in the history
of Des Noycrs; but the man who
bcstcd lllt‘ best at Notre Dame to be
hailcil chatup llu'rc. has a lot be-
hind llllll already. .\ dark horse
l’catlic. who carries the frcshnmii
colors, has been brought into notice.
l’i'attic. also an "ex." this time all
cx-caddy nuister from licacon. has
had plciity of experience and aims
to give plenty of trouble.

State Wins Game
WithE—ngineers

First Game Marred By Errors;
Paul Schmitz Pitches
Brilliant Game

State opened its ’37 baseball cam.
puign last Saturday with a bang by
taking its traditional rival, R.'P.1'.,
into camp via a 15—7 score on the
Blccckcr diamond. Handicapped
several times as the result of errors,
the Statesman were virtuous in bunch-
iiig their hits to their own advantage
and although out' it by the Engineers
ll to S the Hatfield nine held the
upper hand in scoring.

The veteran twirler. l’aul Scliiiiitz,
in coming to the mound with a five
run handicap against him, displayed
brilliant hurling ability to be right-
coiisly credited with the. win.

The l-lnginccrs went off on a well-
cxccutcd batting spree early in the.
initial fraiuc with the head of their
batting order smashing out it well-
placed single to be followed by four
consecutive “binglcs " by the cleanup
mcn. However, the Hatfield nine,
managed to narrow thc visitors’ lead
down to three runs by anncxing two
runs in their hall" of the first stanza;
and behind Schmitz's cool pitching,
which was supportcd by a galaxy of
hits including Walt Daniclwicz’a
homer, li‘ranlr Qnattrochi's triple,
'l‘oiiimy Ryan’s double and Van
l\'curcn‘s singles, the Purple uiul
tiuld Squad forged into the lead never
to l‘clithttiuh their advantage.

State To 
Pratt__B_atsmen

Additional Experience Adda
To Teachers’ Conﬁdence
Against Rivals

Tomorrow afternoon at. 2:30 State’s
diaiiiondcers engage Pratt at Bleecker
Stadium in their second tumle of the
season. Out to revenge the defeats
at the hands of the New York team
in basketball, the players stand a
good chance of coming out ahead.
lt‘l't‘sll from their 15-7 victory over
R.l’.I. last. week, which was only
slightly iuarred by errors, the State
batsmen intend to keep their slate
clean. As far as comparative records
go there is not. much to choose from,
between the two teams. Pratt, too,
has engaged and defeated the Engi-
neers, by a smaller score, to be sure,
but still a win is a win no matter
what the score.

With the additional experience and
practice that the buscmcn have
gained in the past week, the specta-
tors should see a cleaner, faster and
pcppicr game.

The situation this year is much
the reverse of last. spring when State
engaged the l’ratt. aggregation. Then
State had made an early season start
and were in the throes of a four-game
losing streak. We lost that game 11-3
and revenge will be the sweeter if the
home club comes out on top.

The probable batteries for State
will be either Cullen or Schmitz on
the mound and O‘Brien behind the
plate. Coach llatlicld will, in all
probability. startdhe same lineup
that. proved itself a winning coin-
bination last work. namely: Ryan
at 1st; lhilog at ‘2nd; Daniclwicz at
short; Thomas at 3rd; and Van
lx'curcn. liari-cit and Quattrochi in
thc otltlicld.

Next \\’t‘t'li. May 1."). there will be
no game played. On that day there
is a date which has not been filled
so that unless an unforeseen game is
provided. the team will gain a rest.
before meeting a strong I'lartwick
squad on the home field on the 2lst.

Juniors!  Now '
For Hats, Canes, Bands

Juniors must sign tip on the main
bulletin board by this afternoon for
thc traditional Moving-up Day re-
galia. Men will have urmbands and
canes. and women will have hats in
addition, They will be distributed
during the week preceding Moving-
up Day in room X.

The committee in charge of ar-
rangements includes: Marion Ball,
