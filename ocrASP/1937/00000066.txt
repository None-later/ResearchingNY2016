Exit the 1937 Board

With this issue of the STATE COLLEGE News,
the members of the class of 1937 hand down
their journalistic duties to the incoming mem-
bers of the class of 1938. At some time or other
the popular comment may have been that relief
from these duties would be welcome, bllt at this
time when the parting,r becomes imminent and
unavoidable, there is a conspicuous absence of
such sentiment. Such a parting is too per-
manent to be taken lightly.

Fortunately or unfortunately the outgoing
board is unable at this time to congratulate its
successors ill person for the coming year; the
opportunity to do this comes tomorrow as a part
of congratulatory program of Moving-up Day.
However, at this time a wish for a most suc-
cessful and progressive year may rightly be our
parting gesturc, and at the same time there can
be no more significant an expression of our rc-
spcct to the incoming board, colulllnists and coll-
tributors to our News, than to say that we have
no end of confidence ill tllcm and their ability to
duplicate if not illlprovc what has prcccdcd
them.

May our suoccsscs and contributions to ll
bcttcr State Iifc as well as our failurcs to comc
up to thc cxpcctutions of ollr critics scrvc us
challcngcs to u progrcssivc group~«’2l7 to ’ilh.

STATE COLLEGE NEWS, THURSDAY, MAY 20, 1937

After an evening and a day of
Myskunill-topping, frosh-soph battles,
stunts, awards, speeches, parading
and ivy-planting, music will be given
an opportunity to work its soothing
intlucnccs upon the shattered nerves
ot' State tomorrow nigllt at 7:30 when
tllc evening program of Moving-up
Day is inuugurutcd with tllc tradi-
tional “step sing” on the steps of
Draper hull. It will be the fourth
and lust for the “grand old seniors”,
who will realize as the strains of
“(ll-cut Fires” the away that they
have reached the clld of their college
cllrccrs.

Led by Eloise Sllcnrcr, ’37, song
leader of the student association, the
singing of the Alma Mater will opcll
tllc progrulll. Class songs ill order
of scniority will follow, after which
thc prize songs, collsistillg of original
clllss uhlla nlutcrs will be sung in tllc
salllc order.

After the singing of “Um Diddily-
Ulll Bum Buy” and the following
exchange of songs bctwccn the sopho-
more and frcsbllnlu clllsscs, tllc sistcr
classes will rcndcr the songs dcdi-
cntcd to each other.

As anxious sophomores and fresh-
lncn tcnr tllcir hair nlld bite their
nails, John Demo, ’37, prcsidcnt of the
studcnt association will announce the
winners of thc prizc songs, stunts and
gluncs, and will present the inter-
clllss rivalry cup to the class which
has amassed tllc greatest numbcr of
poillts.

With a grcut burdcn lifted from
their minds, the undor-chlssmcn will
then turn to listcn to the sclliors’
rendition of “As Yc Sow”. Each
class ill turn will thcn otl’cr its fare
wcll song to the departing seniors,
followcd by tllc scnior and junior
stop-songs.

As the seniors rcccdc singing the
traditional “(trout l“il'i'.~l”, tllc frcsb-
lllcll will rculizc that tllcir til'st Mow
lug-up lluy has colllo to an cud.

For those who fch the urge to
dnncc, Lou llidcr nlld his orchcstru
will prcsidc from {Hill—12:0” ill lllt'

State’s Coronation Day

 

 

 

 

Commentstater

It is tllo fervent wish of every student of State that
tomorrow morning dawn bright alld clcllr; alld that thc
gods that ho show their favor by giving us all clltirc
day of freshness and beauty. For this is tllc day that
prcsugcs the clld of another school your. From this day
forth it may be truly suid “'l‘cmpus Fugit” which
may be litcrully translated, “’l‘imc’s ll-wastin.”

Dickens might have been thinking of Moving-up Day
wllcn he wrote, “it was tllc host of days; it was the
worst of days.” It is tllc bcst of days, for to many it
marks the end of a year’s strugglc. a your of hard work,
and a ycllr of worry and unccrtniuty. To the fl‘L'Sll‘
men it is a your ot' oricntlltioll; to tllc sopbolllorcs—u
year of battling and llppcr-clnssisnl; to tllc juniors—u
year of painstaking ctl'ort, unccusillg labor, and to
sonic. torriblc unccrtuillty; and, to tllc sclliors——u ycur
of tho burdost study, job-buntngr :llld pruct‘icc touchv
lug. And yet it is tllc worst of days, for it culnlilnltos
a ycur of grcntt activity; it your when most Stutc-uns
have had the best timc of tllcir lifc: :1 your of lcnruing,
of good limos—of lifc to tho full, The frcshlllcn lnlvo

Thoughts of the comingr track meet
this Saturday has led several of our
more intellectual athletes to think in
another direction, namely-why not
put track teams on a varsity basis
at State? Such a team would not
demand any of the superior builds
which a heavier sport, such as foot—
ball, requires—mar would it demand
a great deal of equipment. A pair
of shorts, a shirt, running shoes and
something to run in them are the
prime necessities.

Pushball contests are just about as
risky to predict as football games.
In other words when you have a
strong team such as the sophomores
have placed in the field in previous
struggles, and which has won as con-
sistently as they have, wagers just
aren't made.

Golf and Softball Tournaments
Are Now Well Under Way

Intramural athletics are rounding
out as the sclllcstcr closes. The “21”
contest has become a thing of the
past, while softball and golf continue
to hold sway.

The “El ” contest was eluted last
week, when Miranda, ’38, defeated
(lcorgc Bancroft by a 2-0 scorc. This
win automatically places Miranda ill
the position of champion set-shot
buskctccr at State.

The (lolf tournament is moving on,
uudcr tbc guidance of “Dukc”
llcrsbkowitz. Ball welltbcr bus hold
up this contest considerably, the
spring ruins soggiug up tllc grccns‘
words of tllc golf links to a slow
condition. All gulllcs, llowcvcr, must

Pratt Drives in Four Runs
Before Cullen Rallies
To Stop Score

Saturday, May 8, State batsmen,
ill their second start of tile season,
were defeated by a strong Pratt team
at lllccckcl‘ stadium by a score of
5-3. Willi Cullen on the mound the
game started auspicioust enough but
ill tllc second frame the Prattsmen
scclllcd for a few moments to get
hold of Johnny’s offerings and drove
ill four runs bcforc Cullen settled
down and rctircd the side. It was the
iirst and lust rally of the New York-
crs, for Cullen and Schmitz, who went
on the rubber ill the 8th, between
thcln yicldcd only one lnore run.

Although State thrcatcncd many
times they only capitalized on a. few
of tllcir chunccs.

’l‘llc colltcst was a decided im.
provclllon:, in iiclding, over tllc pre-
vious showing against ll.l’.I. since
there wcrc vory few errors. IIowcvcr,
()‘llricn sccmcd to have difﬁculty ill
