WHAT THESE ACE MERMAIIIS SAY-
Dorolby Poynm Hill speaking: "I'm always
in training. I prefer Camels for their mild-
ness. They never jangle my nerves. I can enjoy
smoking as often as I wish. Another advan-
tage of smoking Camels is the invigorating
'lift' they give me when I'm tired.”

Lenore Kigbt Wingard— one of the greatest
woman athletes of our times—adds this: "I
really get fun out of swimming. Hard work
is part of the game. For four years I’ve been
a Camel fan. Camels help me enjoy my food
no matter how tired or strained I may be.
I’ve found Camels do not irritate my throat.”
