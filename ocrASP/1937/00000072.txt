State College Nine
To Play St. Michael

Team Faces Third Game of Year
At Bleecker Stadium Tomorrow

Tomorrow afternoon at 12:35
o’clock the State baseball nine will
act as host to a hard hitting Saint
Michael’s squad on the Blecckcr
diamond. To date the Hatﬁeld nine
has played but two contest, and as
the tennis squad, they broke even with
one win and one loss with rain step-
ping in to force a cancellation of the
game scheduled for Moving-up Day.

Monday the State squad will in-
vadc Onconta where they will match
hits and runs with a strong Hart-
wick ninc. In their last athletic con-
test with the Johnsorrcoachcd aggre-
gation, the Hatﬁeld baskctccrs
dropped a momorablo win, and in
Monday ’s fracas the Statesman “will
be out for blood” to avenge that loss.

Tomorrow’s fracas with Saint
Michacls will be the first contcst for
the Purple and Gold in the past three
weeks, during which time they have
been put through strenuous workouts
undcr the chic direction of Coach
llatlicld. With an omission of errors
in tomorrow’s gamc, State will un-
doubtably claim victory.

Although weak in hitting. State
forfcitcd their last conlcst as a rc~
suit of their prodigious number of
errors. Stolcn bascs will also be few,
if any, tomorrow as result of much
(-(niccntrution upon a “pcrfcct pcg
to second” during thc past few
wccks.

Bccnusc of a poor showing against
Pratt in their last game, Coach iiut-
licld’s starting lineup will be rather
shakcy up until game time. How-
cvcr, the nine mcn comprising the
team will possibly be: Johnny
O’Brien behind the plate, 'l‘ommy
Ryan on tho initial sack, Larry
Balog at the keystone bag, Bill
'i‘homas on the hot corner, Walt
l)nniclwicz at short, Bill Barrett,
Frank Qlattrochi, and Dar Van
Kcurcn in thc oats and Paul Schmitz
on tho mound.

State Will Contest

Engineers and Bard

State’s tennis team will play a
double decker this weekend when they
journey to Troy to match their skill
with the powerful R.P.I. squad this
afternoon and when they play host
to Bard, in a return engagement on
the Washington Park courts Saturday
afternoon.

'After having twice postponed their
match with R.P.I. as a result of rain,
the State racqueteers will invade the
Engineers’ court this afternoon to
settle a long belated meeting between
Captain Elmendorf, last season’s
stellar basketball forward for the Tro-
jans, and Harold Calm. This clash
bctwcen the two No. 1 men repre-
senting each school promises to be
a hotly contested and hard fought
match.

Saturday the State “swatters” will
play host to Bard, having emerged
victorious in their match earlier in
the season by a 7-2 score. Despite
the final score, the Bard squad put
up a tough fight and in tomorrow’s
encounter State will meet plenty of
opposition.

On Monday the tennis team will
accompany the baseball squad to
Onconta where both will clash with
two Hartwick teams.

in the drive. The funds will be
added to last year's pledges and
will be placed towards a residence
