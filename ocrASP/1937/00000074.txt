Class-bound Students

Students who have been corn—
plalning for years that they

time) this year.

According to an announce-
ment posted on the bulletin

1:35—2:25
2:35—3:25

This change in schedule should
prove to be a god-send to prac-
tice teachers who all too soon
come to realize that “Tempus
fugit" while racing between
Milne and Draper. It might even
remedy some of the traffic jams
on the stairs of Richardson.

lKappa B—etedinters
As Third Fraternity

Kappa Beta, founded in January,
1937, made its formal debut as the
third fraternity of State college this
year with the establishment of
a fraternity house at “.264 Western
Avenue.

The increased quota of mate stir-
dents at the college and the need for
housing facilities for lricli encour-
aged the formation of the third
fraternity. Early in January a ten-
tative organization of some thirty
men was thrilled, with the express
purpose of founding a group house
for men, A constitution was adopted
by the members and formally ap-
proved by Dr. A. R. Brubacher,
president, thus forming Kappa Beta.
the fraternity.

A house committee then took over
the task of leasing and furnishing a
suitable house. The house at 264
Western Avenue was finally chosen.
Furnishing operations were speeded
up with the result that fifteen men
occupied the house during the re-
cent sumllrer session.

At present, there are eighteen men
living iii the fraternity house. Re-
ccllt approval of the Kappa Beta
fraternity house by Miss Helen
ltiorclaud. dean of \voliieri, has plac-
ed tiic house on the approved list
of men's cooperatives.
