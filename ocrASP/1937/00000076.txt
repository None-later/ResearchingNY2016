Albany Concern Robes State
Students and U. S. Presidents

By Betty Bunce

An interview with the academic
department of Cotrell and Leonard
of Albany reveals that there is an
interesting story about the caps and
gowns with which every college
student is familiar.

Caps and gowns were first used
in the twelfth and thirteenth cen-
turies, and were used as a necessity
for warmth in the cold, damp build-
ings of the middle ages. The schol-

women students at its annual Intcr- as and clerics used robes Similar
