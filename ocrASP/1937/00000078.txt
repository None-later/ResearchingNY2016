REVOTES ON QUEEN

Student Council Nominees
Will Briefly Address
Association Today

Today's assembly will be devoted
mainly to business procedure enliv-
ened by a few State College cheers
and songs, according to Warren
Densmore, president of the Student
association.

Voting on the Senior “mosts” will
be first in order. As a result of this
tabulation the following will be
chosen: the most beautiful girl and
the most handsome man; the most
popular girl and the most popular
man, and the girl and man who are
most representative of State college.

In addition to the four girls who
were chosen last week as nominees
for Campus Queen revotes will be
taken for the choice of the fifth
nominee. The four favored ones
thus far are: Dorothy Cain, Janet
Dibble, Muriel Goldberg and Lucille
Zak. It was impossible to determine
the fifth candidate because of the
misspelling of the name, Olsson, (or
Olsen), there being in the senior
class one Anna Olsen and also one
Anna Olsson. Fivc or six different
spellings of this name resulted in
complete confusion in counting the
ballots. This does not mean voting
will be restricted to these two girls.
Student body may vote for any oth-
er girl in the Senior class except
anyone of the four already chosen.

The sophomores who were chosen
last week as candidates for the of-
fice of Student Association secre-
tary; Larry Balog, Joseph Cappiello,
Roswell Fairbank, Willard Frament,
Haskell Rosenberg, and Rita Sulli-
van, will each give a one minute
speech on his or her qualifications
for the office. If the oratory and
content of these hopefuls’ culogies
prove as interesting and well-prepar-

ihc auditorium will echo once more
with some of the familiar songs and
cheers of college tradition. The songs
will be led by Mary Trainor whllc
Marion Kingsley and Gordon Pcut-
tic will capcr away cupubly with a
few cheers.
