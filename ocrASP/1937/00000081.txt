Rivalry Breaks

Last week’s rivalry difficulties, with its
resulting undertones and hurried meet-
ings, are seemingly settled. Students are
again dryly going to classes and Minerva
stands serene as ever, except for a some-
what unsightly bulge at the knuckles of her
right hand.

But is it settled? Or is it only a repeti-
tion of last year’s disturbances, which were
a repetition of those of the year before last,
ad infinitum. What, then, is to prevent
such outbreaks from cropping out in the
future?

The News is not of prim beliefs, but is
clamping down on this sort of thing a sign
of “primness?” Or is it common sense?
College fun means to us something essen-
tial--it is included in the word “college”
itself. But is it fun to tear down the ideal
for which we are striving? Minerva is the
embodiment of that ideal. She is symbolic
of all that we strive to attain, Her statue
is the first thing to attract a newcomer.
It is the last remaining image of our college
balls that the graduate has. What is to be
gained, then, in mutilating the statue so
that when a visitor enters by the front
doors the first thing that greets his eyes is
a swollen and very much repaired white-
ness.

Unorganized rivalry has always result-
ed in destructiveness of some sort. Useless
to argue that it was accidental. Results of
this sort can be foreseen with the first hint
of a sophlmiore-l'reshman scramble in the
college halls.

 

   
  
 

 

  
  

 

 

 

 

The greater the destruction of college
property, the more rigid the rules in regard
to rivalry will be. The complete abolition
of rivalry under such conditions is not too
great an improbabllity. What, then, can be
gained in impromptu mad scrambles
through the halls, which result in breakage,
worry, and financial obligations?

The student association has provided
rivalry functions for the sophomore and
freshman classes. He who has ever been
in a push-ball contest knows that it is no
"kimlcrgarten ping-pong” affair. We

darcsay, though, that if six-foot trenches
were left in the campus that push-bull
Would be abolished, too. You get the idea,
don't you?

' Aw, Lets Have a War

COMMENTSTATER

Repercussions of rumbling cannons in the East
have again brought to our attention that specter--War
——spreading disease, famine, and national hatreds in
its path, hideous creatures that multiply and produce
another era of characteristic tragic warfare.

The last war made the world so safe for demo-
cracy that we are now the last straggling survivors
of the system. Perhaps the world has outgrown the
old spirits of good and fellowship. Perhaps civilization
is a system which develops germs within itself that so
disease the entire structure that it becomes leprous
and then a corpse. Perhaps, too, our parents worked
and suffered to rear us to manhood so that we could
die gloriously for our country. They probably, how-
ever, would rather have us maimed and mangled with
an arm or leg missing—to show what great progeny
they produced and reared.

Perhaps all these are true, and, if so, the world
has taken the right detour and will soon plunge its
speedy new V8 over the cliff of racial suicide.

Perhaps all of the above are true statements. If so,
we’d better quit State college and train how to be
moles instead of teachers. Teaching in the past seems
to have done little good because the present setup is
no less horrifying than that of 1913, or 1700, or any
other crucial year in world history.

We know that all this has been said before and
much more eloquently, but we see before us a great
adversary which the teaching profession can conquer,
not by guns or gases, but by sharp pointed pencils
and machine gunning assignments. Weaving a new
pattern of peaceful world fellowship should be the
object of the next generation of teachers. That‘s if
there is another pedagogical crop---but---perhaps the
world will be left to the dumb creatures.

t '1 t t t t t 0

And now to talk about less important matters,
we've just leafed through a book called The Arts by
Hendrick Van Loon. To talk interestingly is one of
Mr. Van Loon’s great abilities and this book might be
called a conversational bit, except for the fact that it
is 800 pages long; and even the most talkative lecturer
could stand such a strain. The author's personal
viewpoints are radical, at times it seems he makes
them that way to attract attention to his book. But
to all students and future teachers this book is an in—
valuable guide even lf it is not a pocket edition. I
hope this has not made you forget the beginning be-
cause in that there was a definite problem which we
must solve or forget for all times such literature as
The Arts.

Bach of the Week:
Bares Maternal Complex

By Elfreida Hart
They Came Like Swallows, by William Maxwell
Harper Brothers, New York, 267 pages

"They came like swallows and like swallows went,
And yet a woman’s powerful character

Could keep a swallow to its first intent;

And half a dozen in formation there,

That seemed to whirl upon a compass-point,
Found certainty upon the dreaming air . . ."

Here the “woman’s powerful character” is that of
Elizabeth Morison, who is not the popular conception
of a strong-minded woman, but a thoroughly feminine,
humorous lady. They Came Like Swallows is the book
of Elizabeth Morison, as she is reflected in the char-
acters of her sons and her husband. Bunny, aged
eight, her “angel child," Robert, thirteen and diffi-
cult, and James, her husband, all depend on her to
provide a center for their lives. The book does not
deal with the subtleties of Elizabeth's character but
with those of her husband and children; yet each
convolution of their minds is somehow helped by their
relationship to her. Bunny is a sensitive, timid, even
cowardly child who prefers his mother's companion-
ship to that of other children. He looks to her for
indulgence and protection, as well as a sense of perfect
ease and trust. It might be expected that the blow
of his mother's death would fall hardest upon him,
and yet, to his older brother’s disgust, Bunny turns
quickly to an aunt for the mothering he needs,

Robert's dependence on her is deeper and more
complex. At times his mothcr‘s anxiety cxnspcratcs
him, as it would every adolescent boy, and yet his
sense that all is right with his world when she is
near is a profound one. ’l‘hcir companionship was
unrestrained-~in Robert's own thought, " . . . he felt
free to tell her all sorts of things . . . because he
always knew that she would go right on sorting the
sheets and pillow-cases."

It is only after Elizabeth's death, when James is
left with the two children, that we see that Elizabeth
was the pivot of his life. He does not know his child-
ren; he is ill at ease with them and they grate on his
nerves and he on theirs. Elizabeth had formed his

 

 

 

 

 

life and left her mark indelibly upon it.

Classes Organize
Drive for Dues

Class Treasurers Announce
Dates for Collection of
1937-1938 Dues

Collection of dues will begin this
week with a big drive by the soph-
omores. The budget has been ap-
proved by the class and the dues
have been set at two dollars. Ros-
well Fairbank, treasurer, said that
the dates for the collection will be
announced soon.

Gordon Tabner, treasurer of the
junior class, reports that dues will
be collected in Room X at least once
every two weeks. They will be $1.60.
After a reasonable length of time
captains will be appointed to go out
and get the money. ‘

The dues for the senior class will
be less than $1 and will be collected
all next week at a table in the
rotunda. Edward Reynolds, treas-
urer, also said that there is a large
sum of money, representing unpaid
dues of former years, to be collected.

The Appointment Bureau warns
the student body that anyone who
falls to keep a paid—up record of
class dues can not expect recom-
mendation from the bureau.

 

Hellenics

 

 

The season is young and the sel-
ection is choice. The Greeks are
gamboling for just about eveything.
The weekend brought guests in
great profusion, most of them back
“from the field" for the first time.
Delta Omega welcomed Ruth
Wheelock, ’29, and Peg Morton, '34,
while the Chi Slgs did the same for
Estelle Murphy, '37.

Agnes Torrens, ’37, returned tem-
porarily to the KB fold, and a trio
of Beta Zeta alums made an appear-
ance: Mildred Shultes and Elizabeth
Hobbie, both '36, and Katherine
Rogers, '37.

Gamma Kap had guests in quan-
tity as well as quality, by dint of
their annual Alumni weekend. The
high spot of the program was a
luncheon with their faculty mem-
bers as guests.

Pledges, and formal initiations
have kept the scores on their toes:
Chi Sigma Theta announced the
pledging of Edna Fuller, ’40. Their
next-door neighbors, the BZs, initiat-
ed Evelyn Roberts, Mildred Hallock,
Dorothy Hill, and Mary Pierce, soph-
omores.

Esther Lane, ’40, went off the deep
end for Gamma Kap this week.

Eta Phi will be bridging this Week-
end at the Ten Eyck. The party,
which is a benefit bridge social is
being given to commemorate the
forty-first anniversary of the sor-
ority. Marjorie Adams Cameron,
’80, is general chairman of the affair.

Phi Delta mnkcs announcement of
the wedding during the past summer
01' Mabel Mother to Phillip Moore of
Schenectady, N. Y.l Alumnae guests
at the house last week—end were
Minine Mchcklc, Dorothy Graham,
Martha Mac Smith, Inez Roberts
and Eleanor Brown.

Sigma Alpha welcomed Catherine
Paris, '35, into their domiclc lust
week-end.

Two more Greeks paraded down
the aisle recontly—Jeanne Glroux,
’36, was married to Frederick Vogel
of Albany, and Edith Garrison, '35,
her sister BZ, was married to Lauren
Calkin of Washington, D. 0.

So, until next week, have fun!

Statesman

 

Well, it sure looked like Old Home
Week last week-end, What with all
the old drag-er, grads, back. Yes,
sir, they looked mighty spic and
spam-mud scraped off their boots--
hayseed out of their hair--all purtied
up for the college gals and boys.

Among those present at the var-
ious spots were Dene and Liz, Cullen
and Anne, Bob and Mickie, Aggie
and Mike, Bill and Phyllis, Poland
and ---aha--- a Gamma Kap whose
name is not Arline.

We thought the Soph stunt was
swell. Phibbs has got something
there---of course, Densmore is
pretty, too. Local talent was few
and far between at the dancing lat-
er, but not so far between that we
didn’t see Flash Tabner tagging
around after a certain little transfer.
Bosley is a regular razz-ma-tazz on
the dance floor—never an idle mo-
ment. We suppose that it was some
weighty class problem that Lloyd
and Rita are discussing these days.
Lady Sally is acquiring some ved-
dy, veddy proletarian habits, frank-
ly. We hear that Trehanon is en-
joying his practice teaching. Dot
is essentially a home girl---she just
loves to learn things about operating
a furnace.

Have you heard about the Circu-
lation club? ---Ask Rog or Harry.

Now the High School lads are
moving in on the State men---are
we men or are We nice? Dick made
a fox pass at the reception the other
night, but Duke showed his Kingsley
spirit, and forgave him.

Sights worth seeing---Crounse and

Densmore eating gooey sundaes at
a local ice-cream establishment---
Rand and O'Hora going Tyrolean in
those wacky bonnets---
We note that there are several
more parties coming up this week-
end. Phi Delt and Gamma Kap on
Friday and EEP on Saturday ought
to unearth some unusual combina-
tions. We wonder if a certain fresh-
man has changed his mind yet
about the State women.

J. Strong has developed an in-
satiable interest in things journalis-
tlc~even unto the Albany papers.
Last Saturday's open house at the
Dorm revealed a swing interpreter
of popular music in the freshman
class. That same party was popu-
larized in the Albany papers with
its peculiar Doette line—the Stag
line was also much in prominence.

Our pussyfoot Hertwig has won
his standing in the previously men-
tioned sorority house and now sports
a private key to same, a la King
Solomon?

We feel that we have to break in
here with a moral. Here goes! A

an ounce of cure is worth twenty-
flve cents at all drug and depart-
ment stores.

Pushball odds are quoted 3-2 . . .
take your choice . . they were
about 20-1 on the sophs last year,
weren’t they, Muggleton? . . . Johnny
Yatsenik, ’41, head of the Fresh
pushballers, has forty men from
which to select his two teams . .
how many have the sophs got, Cap-
piello? . . .

We sorta like soph money . . . we
only “like” it, though . . . the memo-
ries of a thirst for Yankee blood
still remain . . . we hear that Amyot
and Walko collaborated on a “do-
or-die-for—the alma-mater" speech
last Tuesday at Frosh practice . . .

One Frosh remarked that Walko
had possibilities . . . was his face
red when “Coach” Walko announced
himself . . . a blue-eyed, innocent-
looking Frosh asked if Ken Doran
was the varsity "stooge" . . . we de-
manded an explanation . . . but he
was so innocent-looking . . , then
there was the gal who asked if
Schmltz went to Albany Business

. after all, eVerything’s business,

eh Schmltz?

We hear that Coach Ryan is lec-
turing on "basketball fundamentals"
for the Milne boys . . . what We'd
like to know is where Ryan learned
the fundamentals . . . by the way . ..
how about that Frosh-Milne high
game? . . .

We found a note in the "R" sec-
tion of the mailbox the other day.
. . . it read, “you (censored), don’t
you suppose the class of 40's basket-
ball men ever had any (censored)
(censored) experience? They went
to high school. What the (censored)
is the matter with a little publicity?

a (censored)"

Well, We have the alibi that space
was limited in last week’s issue . .
but We think it best to wait and see
if “the class of 40's basketball men"
can weather this year’s varsity cam-
paign . . . and next year we trust
and assure publicity to each and
every one . . . (how’s that for evad-
ing the issue?) . . .

To you basketeers — varsity and
frosh—we offer a quotatoon from
President Angel! in his valedictory
to Yale last spring:

A shrine where men have
sought and found learning and
pure manners; a temple of the
spirit on Whose altars scholars
have ever placed the treasure of
their age—long search for truth.
Hold her over in reverence; hold
her ever dear; and at the end
of a sunlit trail, may you find
your heart’s desires,

This is the attitude which most
collegians have adopted. It creeps
over one before he has even matricu-
lated; and it grow as he completes
his four years. He keeps it forever;
and back he treks when he can ~—
"back to Page hull,” "turning our
footsteps homeword,” or however it
is expressed by each institution. It
is a beautiful idealization of alma
mater. Small and poor though one's
college may be, the same view is
taken by every normal boy or girl
who is brnndcd in soul with its
name,

We feel that President Angell's
quotation throws a light, sharp and
piercing, on the interpretation of the
word sporlrmmuship. And We agree
that Walko and Amyot's speeches
last Tucsduy to the Frosh curried
with them this intcrprctutlon. It
matters not that the game is won
but, rather, how it is won.

Coach Builds New Varsity;
Tom Ryan and Juniors
Will Compose Squad

In response to Coach Hatfield’s
summons for basketeers sixteen as-
pirants for varsity berths during
State's 1937-38 basketball campaign
assembled in Page hall Monday
afternoon.

Lost from last season are: Tommy
Barrington, Johnny Ryan, George
Bancroft, Freddy Byrnes, Dick Mar-
gison, Eddie Irwin and Charley Mor—
ris. The absence of the seven vet-
erans will be a severe handicap for
the Hatfield aggregation to over-
come. Despite the fact that coach
Hatfield foresaw the loss last year
and gave his under-classmen plenty
of experience throughout the season,
the stamina and cageness displayed
so brilliantly by the veterans will
sorely be missed this season.

With but one Junior on last year’s
entire varsity squad, Coach Hatﬁeld’s
“galloping sophomores" will be for-
ced to move up to varsity posts.
From captain Tom Ryan and the
seven sophomores, Coach Hatfield
will build his varsity squad. As
Ryan is the only senior, the limited
amount of upperclass material will
make it necessary for Hatfield to
find varsity reserves in last. year’s
Frosh. Thus, Tommy Barrington,
’37, last season's Frosh mentor, will
find his efforts of a year ago we!-
comed. .

It was Hatfield’s "galloping soph-
omores” who claimed consecutive
victories over Hartwick, the Alumni,
R. P. I., St. Michael's and Bard last
year. Following the snappy 15-point
pace set by acting captain Tommy
Ryan, the statesmen claimed the
50-39 win over Hartwick. Ryan
again led the Purple and Gold to
a 19-34 victory over the Alumni and
a 36-27 win over a highly fooled

. R. P. I. squad.

Against St. Michael’s, the soph-
omore quint was forced to be replac-
ed by the well seasoned seniors.
However, against Bard, the soph-
omores again found themselves and
played brilliant ball to annex a 32-23
win.

Those who reported Monday after-
noon were Captain Tommy Ryan;
Mike Walko, Duke Hershkowitz,
“Wheeze” Lehman, George Amyot,
Ken Doran, Merrill Hurd, Frank
Quattrochi, B!!! Torrens, juniors;
Larry Balog, Homer Leggett, Will
Frament, Barney Tuttle, Walt Dan-
llcwicz, Gordon Peattle and Bill
Barrett, sophomores.

Tracksiers To Try
For Varsity Berths

To-morrow morning, at 10:30
o’clock, eleven State barriers will vie
for individual laurels as well as for
varsity berths over the strenuous 4.1
mile Lincoln park course in their
first trial run of the season.

Due to DeRusso’s illness, Tony
Wilczynski, '39, has been made acting
manager of the team.

The 4.1 mile course over which the
hill and dalcrs will race is the long-
cst grinding run the team has.
Starting at the entrance of Washing-
ton Purk at State and Eng'lewood
Place, the course ii. over fairly level
ground. l..cuving the park at Knox
and Mudisou, the boys enter the
toughest part of the course. They
climb uphill behind the old pcncten-
Mary and then down in back of
I‘lucketl. Junior High, ascending sev-
eral hills to Holland avenue.

Going down Holland, and continu—
ing over Mol'toll uvenue, the boys

Varsity Squad Prepares
Winter Court Campaign

 

Twenty-Eight F rosh

George Amyot and Mike Walko
to Coach Yearling Squad

Twenty-eight freshmen were in
evidence last Tuesday in answer to
the call sent out by coaches George
Amyot and Mike Walko, juniors, for
those interested in trying out for
the yearling basketball squad. This
number bettered last year's figure by
nine men.

An outline for the basketball activ-
ities was set forth. There will be at
least one solid month of drill in
fundamentals before any scrimmage
will be engaged in.

State college is primarily an edu-
cational institution and sports are
necessarily of secondary importance,
they were told. The emphasis will
not be placed on winning games, but
upon the sportsmanship and the
practical value of the games. Fresh-
man basketball is the first step to-
wards particlpation on the varsity
level. Discouragement, however.
should not be felt by those who are
cut. They are urged by both Amyot
and Walko to continue with the
game in intramurals.

Those who turned out last Tues-
day were: John Bakay, Patsy Turino,
Harold Duffey, Sam Romanchak,
Cyril Kilb, Dan Bucci, Irving Smith,
Eugene McNally, Stanley Smith,
John Vatsenik, Vincent Gillen. Wil-
liam Brophy, Roy McCreary, Charles
Quinn, Leslie Gerdts, William Heller,
Gerard Saddlemire, Richard Aber-
nathy, Steve Paris, Phil Sullivan,
Louis Greenspan, Fred Day, Joe
Schwartz, Matt Gadziala, Jack
Adam, Leonard Varmette, Ralph
Woodward, and George Noonan.

Whot ho! We’re off to Indian Lad-

Haile’s cave, and up, and down, and
around the ladder.

Memorandum:—
hikerswwear enough clothes to keep
warm.
explorers—bring flashlights. There
is no electric lighting system around
the Underground Lake.
food committee—for gosh sakes,’
bring the food!
everybody—have a swell time!

Maybe at last the hockey play-
ers will be quiet for a little while
at least. The dorm field has been
lined so that now they can get into
full swing, but don‘t swing it (we
mean the sticks!) too hard.

Junior-senior week-end was quite
a success, except for the fact that
half the food was at Chatham and
the other half at Albany. Four fac-
ulty members—Miss Johnston, Miss
Kirkpatrick, Dr. Morris, and Dr.
Croasdale—made the trek out to
camp for part of the week-end.

Due to the slightly damp weather
last week the tennis tournament has
been delayed. At the last report

Cupid’s competitors are hard at
work trying to roll up a consistent

That's all for now, but we’ll be

Girls’ Athletics g
Feature Change

G.A.A.Becomes New W.A.A.
Constitution is Revised;
New Requirements

After a little more than twenty-
five years, the feminine athletic fac-
tion at State has become of age.
There is no more “Girl's Athletic
Association." It is now the "Women's
Athletic Association of New York
State College for Teachers."

Last spring the incoming council
felt that the constitution of the asso-
ciation was outmoded. Ethel Little,
’38, June Palmer and Betty Allen,
juniors, were appointed as a consti-
tutional revision committee. Last
week the recommendations of this
committee were voted upon and
passed by a majority of all active
members of the association.

Candidates for office in W. A. A.
must have completed the require-
ments of three sports during the
year in which they are to be
elected. Sports credit earned in
the previous spring will be consider-
ed for eligibility. All freshmen
nominees except the manager of
freshmen athletics must have com-
pleted credit in three sports during
the fall and winter seasons.

The amendments concerning the
change from "cheerleader" to “song-
leader" and. the additional specifi-
cation of the vice-president's duties
were made merely to have the state-
ment of the constitution coincide
with actual practice.

Under the new setup the associa-
tion will become a better organized
group because the clariﬁcation of all
the doubtful statements in the old
constitution will make all the of-
ficers certain of their duties and will
make all the activities of the or-
ganization deﬁnite. The various en-
terprises oi' the group are not
changed with the new name.
