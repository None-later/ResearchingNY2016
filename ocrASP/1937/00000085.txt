Abolish N. Y. A.

Last week the News printed some facts
relative to the cutting down Of N. Y. A.
funds. This reduction has brought heated
opposition from many colleges and univer-
sities in the country.

The News, however, feels that this op-
position is totally unwarranted. First, why
were federal aid jobs created? The answer
is that, as a RELIEF MEASURE, the gov-
ernment instituted positions for the youth
of the nation who needed the money to
stay in school. A good number of these

jobs were real and necessary; many were
excuses for charity. The opposition argues
that there are still many college youths who
need reimbursement. However, there were
such people before the depression. The
Federal EMERGENCY Relief Act came
with the depression, and it is only fitting
that it leave with the depression. The im-
proved economic conditions Of parents of
college students should take care of college
educations today.

The first argument advanced by those
who are bitterly opposed to the cut is:
“Funds definitely are needed.”

True, funds are needed. Funds are al-
ways needed, They were needed before
the emergency act. But the height of their
need came during the peak years of the
depression. This need was therefore taken
care of by an emergency relief measure.

Their other argument is that “Commend-
able as is the desire to balance the budget,
the cuts don't have to be taken out of the
hides of youth” and the fact that “85% of
the delegates” (to the N. S. F. A. Confer-
ence) decided to ask Congress “for more
money for youth."

This argument seems to us extremely
flimsy. Why shouldn’t relief measures for
youth he cut down along with all other
relief measures? And these same youths
that clamor for N. Y. A. today will rant at
the high taxes tomorrow.

As long as this country is to remain a
democracy, as long as the people wish to
get alongr on their own initiative, they
should not beg for relief from the govern-
ment. As a temporary act, federal aid is
admirable, Admirablc, also, is its gradual
decline with aid gchn to those students who
are still dependent on it. When it is totally
abolished there will still be those people
who will need the money. Those people
can obtain positions in other than govern-
ment work. With the gradual passing of
depression comes the gradual opening-up
of jobs in the ordinary business world, and
those people who are working their way
through college can do so through these
other positions, as did many a colleglan
before there was any such thing as the
Federal Emergency Relief Measure for the
1929 Depression.

 

  
   

 

 

 

 

  
  

 

Extra- Class Teachers

At Saturday’s conference of the Central
School Section of the Associated Academic
Principals at Syracuse, special stress was
laid on extra-class activities for the second—
ary school teachers.

Extra-class activities are now assuming
an importance closely second to academic
teaching. A teacher is now expected to
direct clubs and activities in high school.
These clubs previously consisted of depart-
mental clubs, journalistic societies, and
athletic clubs. Now extra-class activities
invade every field where a possible hobby
may linger. Knitting and crocheting clubs,
marionette clubs, rifle clubs, clubs for the
philatelists, and clubs for would-be terp-
sichorean artists have come into being in
the secondary school extra-class education-
al program.

People who expect to teach school
should have hobbies—hobbies in every
field. For one reason, hobbies tend to give
a person added information about interest-
Ing things of life. These interests will do
much toward making the teacher’s life
more interesting and stimulating. The
teacher, through hobbies, will come more
into contact with the world and will become
less grim through daily detail.

These interests, if passed on to students,
are obviously of tremendous importance.
Those students who lead sequestered lives
on farms, as many students of this state do,
Will find impetus for a zest for living. The
teacher is wanted who can teach academic
material and also direct the leisure activity
of students.

 

Bull and Baloney

COMMENTSTATER

What activity have you got the most out of in
State college? We know it's an old and trite question
but we’d like to have you start thinking about this
and see if you agree with our idea. We believe that
we’ve learned more from bull sessions than we have
learned from any class or any activity that we've en-
gaged in.

Bull sessions make you think and that’s what most
of us do too little of, or do you? The other night we
got into an argument and found there are still people
left who refuse to listen to other peoples’ arguments
in any subject. We really don’t care because our ideas
aren’t worth hearing or reacting but we do not like to
see people with such a smug, complacent attitude
that they wouldn’t even listen to a Darwin or a
Nietzche if he were teaching at State,

It’s very difficult to believe that all ideas of every
one on any certain subject are all very clear and very,
oh, very, correct. We somehow do not believe that
any mortal person at any time in his life is definitely
positive that his philosophy on life is absolutely cor-
rect. If you ever feel like this, just read a great radical
thinker like Thomas Paine and you'll find that many
of your assumptions are built on sand. In fact you‘ll
find that the concrete was not in your philosophical
base but in thine cranium.

Many people have told you that the mark of an
educated man is his ability to doubt. You’ll find that
every bull session will contain a remark that will
make you think and to think is to doubt and to doubt
is to educate one and so you’ll soon how a degree. Do
I make myself clear ( not queer)?

Some time your chatter will be on the most trivial
details such as; boys (or girls), clothing, a way to play
to play bridge, or something else that's light. Then
again it may take a sudden turn and it will be ex-
tremely serious—about books, philosophy of living.
teaching attitudes, You'll really learn something from
such activity, so, Why don't you drop that book for an
hour or so. or leave that burnlng ambition for a high
activity post and sit down and ’gab'? You might
learn little or you might learn much, depending on
the mood and ability of your group.

The other night We were discussing Schopenhauer
(if that's spelled right it is a miracle) and remembered
that he said that a man fell ln love with a woman:
first, for her nose; second, for her hair; and third,
for her eyes. How many of you men at State havo
fallen in lovo with that latest peach fuzz of yours
because of the classic beauty of her nose, If that's
the first thing you consider, then you, too, may be a
great philosopher. However, to argue w.’th the gentle-
man; We believe, in modern days, that personality is
more important to a girl or fellow than pulsating pul-
chritudo. And if you want that old personality you

When and if you find yourself at
the Colonie Country Club on No-
vember 5, you’ll be sure to notice a
diminutive little fellow who prances
about in front of the orchestra. A
little inquiry at that point will reveal

 

 

 

him as Joe Haymes, whose place in
the radio and dance orchestra field
has gone far out of proportion to
his size.

Heralded as “American’s Swing
Stylist,” Haymes has surrounded
himself with a company of fifteen
musicians and entertainers. Featur-
ed with the orchestra are Honey
Burns, Bonnie Chase, and Clyde
Rogers, vocal soloists who have been
heard with the orchestra on many
of their NBC and CBS network
broadcasts.

The popularity of Joe Haymes and
his orchestra is due in a great degree
to the many phonograph recordings
made by the band. They have made
numerous records for Victor, Bruns-
wick, and the Columbia recording
companies and many are listed as
best sellers.

Joe, who plays piano, arranges,
and composes, has to his credit such
well known numbers as "The Life
of the Party,” "One Man Band,”
“Let’s Have a Party," and “My Fa-
vorite Band."

Haymes’ rather checkered career
has included positions of such Wide
variety as being a professor of music
in a small Missouri college at the age
of nineteen, chief arranger for Ted
Weems at twenty, and a batoneer in
his own right at twenty-one. It was
he who developed the present orches-
tra under Tommy Dorsey, having
sold its rights last year.

Haymes developed his present
style of what might be called soph-
isticated swing as a result of his
many years experience with arrange-
ments.

Stellar Performances—
Sparkling Direction

Successful Start

 

_PLAYGOER
Last Tuesday night the Advanced

 

Drumatics class presented their first '

two productions (f the season. Their

well chosen and well directed plays , ,

were received by a large and enthus-
iastic audience.

The comedy directed by Miss
Bolton was excellent entertainment.
The set, props, and costumes pro-
vided the authentic ‘back in the
hills‘ atmosphere. Miss Jesse devel—
oped a remarkably real character.
Her only faults were occasional
youthful movements and her lack of
enough variety to rise to the climax
interestingly, Miss Gifford helped
create reality by her convincing
piece of work. Mr. Stevens was a
very likable and magnetic Orrle. His
chlci‘ need is added experience.

Miss Mlnst is to be especially com-
plimented in her splendid lmndllng
of a very difficult play. The actors
hold the audience‘s attention in
spite of comparatively little action
and long uninterrupted speeches.
Mr, Meltz gave Us a Very carefully
and intelligently thought-out por-
trayal. Even during moments when
he had only to listen, we felt that
ho was developing his character.
Miss Donnelly's charm and poise
caught our attention immediately,
and her lovely voice held our interest
through the long unfolding of the
situation. The performance of the
evening was Miss Slnovoy‘s. Her
own identlty was completely lost in
that. of the old woman, Her chur-
uctel' evolved through infinite variety
of gesture, voice inflection, and
mood; until she had translated the
psychological term of “threshold”
into a personal experience.

Congratulations to the Advanced
Drumntics of ’38. You're off to a
good start. Keep it up.

to the various houses this week-end.

Beta Zeta welcomed Helen Clyde,
Betty Narosly, and Mary Markham,
all of ’37, Charlotte Rockow and
Emma Rogers, both ’36.

Chi Sig announces that it has two
honorary members, Mr. and Mrs,

the door-bell at the Chi Sig house:
Kay Kearney, and Eileen Wallace of
’35; Rita Kane, ‘36 Campus Queen;
and Frances McVeigh and Estelle
Murphy of last year’s class.

Shirley Kaplan and Fay Scheer,
sophomores, took the final vows at
AEPhl, and incidentally the AEPhl's
played hostess to Florence Marx, '30;
Hermlne Williams, ’32; Bess Hart-
mann, ’35; and Phyllis Grossman,
and Lois Kraus, both '37.

Pl Alpha Tau wishes to announce
a change of residence. The new
address of the PATs is 63 North

included Tilda Centner, ’34; and
Sherle Goldstone and Helen Loth, of
'36.

Alpha Rho entertained Phyllis
Vermilye, '37, while Marlon Town—
send, ’37, made herself at home at
Epsilon Beta Phi.

Kappa Delta had a full house over
the week-end. The guests included
Marion Heinneman, ’35; Kathryn
Jumbo. Betty Morrow, and Mary
Harbow, last year‘s seniors, and
Cornelia Schoonmaker and Virginia

So, after all is said and done, we
still love the alums and may they
keep coming back!

Campus Day is
Great Success

Sophs Push Way to Victory;
Juniors Swamp Seniors;

Frosh Girls Win

An all day drizzle on Campus Day
necessitated a change in the outdoor
program, which saw the girls’ hockey
and the Junior-Senior softball game
transformed into basketball games.
Only the Soph-Frosh pushboll col.-
test was played as scheduled.

In the first basketball game, the
lucklcss seniors were overwhelmed
by a junior squad, composed almost
entirely of last year‘s sophomores,
who will probably make up our var-
sity this year. Next, the efficient
fresh girls’ basketball team defeated
the sophomore girls 9 to G, in the
first freshman victory of the year.
Although sophomores Sullivan and
Mitchell tallied early in the fracas
to set off the fireworks with a hang,
the freshman combination, led by
Mllller and Ritchie and Bussncher
quickly overcame their tiring rivals.

The pushball contest, played on a
slippery field, was the first bit of
official rivalry of the year.
the opening whistle the crowd was
amazed to see the fresh work the
ball toward the sidelines, into sopho-
more territory, but the experienced
sophomores quickly took command
and rolled down over the plucky
freshnmn first team for the first
five points. Just before the half
time whistle, the invinclblc sopho—
mores, after a sec—sawing tussle, suc-
ceeded in pushing the huge sphere
down for another score, although the
class of ’41 fought for every inch.
The half ended 10-0 with the bull
in sophomore territory, and the ox—
hausted players drugged off the
field.

The second sophomore squad met
a dctermlned team, led by Steve
linl! und Jerry Suddlcmire, who rc-
slslcd their scoring attempts, until,
following the example of Silllillolls
and Howe, llle sophs annexed iln-
finul goal. In the closing lllllllllu

consistently, but failed to place the
boil in u scoring position, With

freshmen will certainly put up an

either class. Perhaps the next on-
counlcr will be more disastrous.

STATE COLLEGE NEWS, OCTOBER 29, 1937

to Tackle l

for Third Win Against
Down River Rivals

Last Wednesday’s Time Trial
Shows a Strong Squad
In Cross Country

To-morrow afternoon the purple
and gold harriers will tackle Bard in
their initial meet of the season over
the newly planned 4.4 mile Lincoln-
Washington Park Course.

In the three years that cross
country has been a varsity sport, the
State hill and dalers have yet to
lose a meet to Bard. They first ran
the boys from Annandale-on-the-
Hudson in 1935 with captain Harold
Haynes, ‘38, taking the meet in his
first year running under state colors.

Haynes, Key Man

Last year, Haynes not only took
first place again but he broke a rec-
ord of five years' standing on Bard's
course. He lowered the time by
thirteen seconds, romping in with a
snappy 23:42 for the 4.1 mile run;
Tony Wilczlnski, '39, took “place”
one second under the old record of
23:55.

Bard has just recently been de-
feated by R. P. I. to the tune of
15-40. The Trojans, in addition to
this Whitewashing placed twelve men
before a Bard runner crossing the
finish line. In View of manager Joe
De Russo’s attempt to add the En-
gineers to State’s Schedule, it should
be interesting to see what the result
of tomorrow's meet will be.

Last Wednesday, the first time

 

With .

trial over the new course was run
'with Tony Wilczynski taking the
[heat in record time of 24:24. He
was closely followed by Frank Rick-
man, ’40, with only four seconds
separating them.

The time, 24:24, for the 4.4 mile
course is the new standing record
set by Wilczynski. Will tomorrow
see the lowering 01' this record? The
result of the meet will show.

The surprising upset of the time
trial over the new course, was Hay-
nes coming in sixth place. In spite
of his poor showing, it is expected
that he will lead the purple and gold
to victory.

Louis Francello and Steve Szawal-
oski, sophomores, came in third and
fourth places respectively. It cer-
tainly appears that the sophomore
trio of Rlckman, Francello, and
Szawalowskl make a winning com-
bination, Walter Russ, ’39, finishing
in fifth place and Jim Snover, ’41.
coming up in the rear in seventh
place make up the team that will
face Bard tomorrow.

Second Team

A second team composed of those
men who didn't make the varsity
will also run. This will give those
who have not been out long a chance
to get some experience in competi—
tion.

The boys who will be on the
second team are as follows: Jim
Johnson, '39, Walter KllIner, Douglas
Manley. and Lloyd Cloom, freshmen.

Tony Wllczynskl and J00 De Russo
are the men who mapped out the
new course. As it Is now, the last
two miles bring the hill and dnlers
around the lake, up by the tennis
courts, back tn the lake and on to
the Inacadum road a! Englcwood
Plnce.

This gives the runners a two hun~
drcd yard siruighiuway finish and
joliablcs the spectators to see the bust
llltll'l. of the race.

Joe l.)l‘ Russo asks that those men
who would be interested in inking
,puI't in the Inch as aids and off!-
('luls to please h‘i‘c him some time
lo-duy or write him a note telling
him of their willingness to serve.

’l‘cum Prospects

It is the hope of the boys to place
men in at least seven places. Com-
purlng the time record of the Bard
course with that of State, it shows
that State should place eight men
before a Hard runner crosses the
finish line.

When the season started, the
squad lost the services of Joe De-
Russo and Ed Reynolds. seniors,
through illness and schedule conflict.
Now, the team is in the mood to

Novices Give Veterans Race
For Squad Positions;
Cutﬂosh Squad

 

The varsity and freshmen squads
are getting workouts that are really
work in preparation for the new sea-
son. With the center top eliminated,
the players will have to be in the
ultimate of condition to keep up
with the promised faster pace of
the new rule. No new cuts are
promised in either the varsity or
freshmen squads although the recent
cut of the freshmen has left only
nineteen men out for yearling
berths.

Both of the squads will continue
practicing fundamentals until the
first of next month. While the
freshmen are getting over some of
their awkwardness at ball handling,
the varsity men are developing a
great deal of efficiency. A fast and
furious puce has so far been the rule.
The court looks more like a con-
glomeratlon of fast running half-
bucks than the old stop and think
basketball.

Although the present juniors by
virtue of their experience last year
on the varsity have a partial edge
on the less experienced sophomores,
they will have to prove their worth
in order to get positions this year.
The squad will be picked on the
worth of the individual players in
the practice sessions alone, Coach
Hatfield asserted. No cuts will be
made until scrimmage has been held
since it is unfair to judge actual
play on knowledge of fundamentals.

Those freshmen who still remain
eligible for the yearling team after
first out are: Dick Abernathy, John
BI'Ikay, Fred Day, Harold Duffey, Lcs
Gerdts, Vincent Gillen, Bill Holler,
Cyril Kllb, Roy McCreary, George
Noonun, SteVe Paris, Charlie Quinn,
Sam Romanchak, George Saddle-
Inire, JOe Schwartz, Stan Smith,
Phil Sullivan, Patsy Turlno and

 

trample their rivals into decisive
defeat.
