Relieve Your Conscience!

The last thing the News editorial wishes
to be is preachy, but the question if misap-
prehended library books comes to the fore
again.

Last year, the library committee, com-

posed of faculty and student members, or-

ganized a drive for the returning of books
accidentally taken from the library Without
being registered. We are happy to an-
nounce that a fifty per cent improvement
has been noticed.

However, to get at that remaining per-
centage, the News, in conjunction with the
library committee, is conducting a cam-
paign. The set—up of the plan is simple:
Every group house has a member whose
duty it is to see that such library books are
returned. A basket will be placed in the
Activities office for this express purpose.
No questions will be asked, as it is assumed
that the person is merely acting in behalf
of others. No record is kept by the Library
of what or how much is returned from each
house ——all that need be done is to bring
them and say “lost books.”

Let us add a word more about the
library. The library is not to keep books
from circulating. On the contrary, to facil-
itate this, there is a practical system of
withdrawal. Abide by this system. It pays.

After N. Y. A., What?

Last week’s editorial “Abolish N. Y. A.”
has created soch heated discussion through
State's corridors, that we feel a clarification
of our stand is definitely in order.

Wc recognize that many college stu-
dents need aid to get through college; we
recognize that the present set up of N. Y. A.
has done much to help thcsc students, we
also recognize that in some cases jobs hnvc
bccn flagrantly ucceptcd whcrc tho finan-
cial need was not onti'rciy pressing, and
still we maintain that N. Y. A.. as it is now,
should be abolished.

liowcvcr, We suggest that federal aid
to students be reorganized on a more prac—
tical basis. The trend of modern educa-
tion is to see that finances shall not be a
barrier to keep talented students l'rom in—
creasing their worth to socicty through a
college odUcation, N.Y.A., as it now stands,
is not on permanent enough ground to in-
sure aid for a student. throughout his four
years at college.

We suggest that a new system of fed—

 

 

eral aid be invm.ed, that a more accurate
method be evolved whereby aid be given
where ability and financial need demand
it, and that this aid be a permanent insur-
ance of help during the four years of
college.

_ N.  A. is most certainly a step in the
right direction. Perhaps, the much talked
of federal scholarship is now in order?

Techniques of Teacher Self-Placement
by William A. MacDougall, Ph.D.
Holt Printing Company
Grand Forks, North Dakota, 238 pages

The title of the book is self-explanatory. Various
factors influencing teacher selection are taken up
in detail. Personality, health. intelligence, training,
etc., the commonly thought of factors in job getting
are discussed. Seemingly irrelevant topics in the
realm of teacher placement as prejudice, distance to
school. “pull,” and luck are explained. “A candidate
may have all possible preparations for a job and com-
plete investigation concerning it, he may know that
his qualifications are the best among the applicants,
yet mere chance may determine the election regardless
of other factors.“

Section II of the book deals with the application
photographs. Mistakes in attire and pose are enumer-
ated and then illustrated with many excellently ex-
pressive pictures. Errors commonly found in men’s
and women‘s photographs are shown, and these pic-
tures are followed by perfect application photographs
which are free from the discussed defects.

The section of the book which will probably be of
most value to this year's seniors and graduate students
is the one on the letter of application. Aptly put are
such “don'ts” as:

“I am one of the teachers who failed to find a job
last September."

“I am looking for a place where my work will
be appreciated."

Don’t mention financial conditions which make
it necessary for you to teach.

Other important and interesting sections of the
book include those concerning employment of teachers
in outlying possessions of the United States and in
Indian schools, teacher placement bureaus and agen-
cies, employment of teachers in city schools, and the
ethics of the teaching profession in job hunting.

i1 fr '4 t it

When letters of application are a more vital issue,
the News will print more information in regard to
them, offering suggestions and showing “model” letters.

Those seniors or graduate students who are inter-
ested in reading Techniques of Teacher Self Place-
ment may borrow the book from the Appointment
Bureau, located in rooms 121A and 121B of Milne High

' school.

 

‘Tradition Was Made to Keep ’

 

COmmentstater

This morning the freshman class will make its
annual parade around the auditorium of Page hall.
We have been waiting for the occasion with great
gusto, because We remember our own freshman days
and the moments of mental anguish We had to endure
for the duration of the procession. But We realize
now that the experience was well worth the jibes and
taunts of the otherwise friendly upperclassmen, for
We were carrying on one of State's oldest and most
popular traditions.

Last year's procession was the object of a great
deal of comment. The freshmen paraded with more
luck of respect than in any previous year. The bolster-
ousncss of the situation got out of hand to the extent
that ilic prcsldcnt of Student association practically
had to call out the State Militia.

We don’t blame it on the l'i‘cshnicn of last year.
Naturally they were new to the school and the custom.
instead, We crlllclzc those uppcrclnsmncn who had
previously bclittlcd the tradition to the class of 1040.
We say that it is the duty of the juniors and seniors
to uphold the traditions of the college, If our trud-
ltlons are worth having, they are worthy of decent
respect and obedience.

To the freshmen We say, make this morning’s
assembly an opportunity for you to show your sports-
manship, and your ability to take it in the appi‘chd
"frosh manner." It may take a bit of courage, blit
remember that We all havo done it, and we'll be
laughing with you. not at you,

BC.

Our tennis tournament, unlike
that of M. A. A.. has reached its
last stage. There remains only the
final play—off between Helen Miller
and Peggy Winn. Here's luck, may
the best girl come out on top and
then hang on to her aces until the
championship play-off next spring.

The Hallowe'en week-end at Camp
Johnston went over in a big way,
except for the pineapple. Wonder of
wonders, it didn‘t rain! And no one
got 1051 on the new ten Nil-mile
hike.

Leading the archery tournament
are Elda Hayes, Marlon Kcables,
Grace Moon, Frances Rlnni and Isa—
bel Robinson. Captain Mlllic Mosicr
has posted on the A. A. bulletin
board a list of those who still lack
completed crcdit in archery.

One would think that by this time
that Robinson girl would know which
side of a horse is the top! But no,
she still insists on riding in a more or
less up—sidc-down fashion. This has
to stop some time, though. She
can’t go on falling off indefinitely!

Start saving your pennies, gals—
Fall Awards Banquet is coming up
in a little over a week. It's going to
be different, this year, too. 'I‘hei'e'll
be an outside speaker, some veddy
schnozzy decorations and LOTS of
fun!

Purple and Gold Keeps
Record of no Defeats
intact

With Frank Rickman. '40, leading
the purple and gold barriers to vic-
tory, State downed the Redskins
from Bard to the tune of 19-36.
Rickman was closely followed by
Tony Wilczynski, ’39, and Captain
Harold Haynes, '38, who finished in
two-three order respectively.
This gives the Pedagogues their
third straight victory over the Bard-
sters in as many starts and it also
keeps the Peds' slate of no defeats
over a two year period clean.
Description of Race
At the start the entire Bard aggre-
gation took an early lead over State,
but, nearing Madison Avenue the
purple and gold passed the Redmen
to pace Testi of Bard. Increasing
in speed, the Redskins forged ahead:
to lake the lead in the first sixl
places. At this point a State spec-‘
tutor was heard to groan, "Gosh.
State will never overcome that load!"

However. at the halfway mark
Slate. was in R winning position and
going up Morton m‘cliuc the teach-
ers widened lne distance between
them and the Bardslcrs. Testl of
Bard was in the lead by a 150 yard
margin over the nearest State man.
Franccllo, Rickman, Wilczynski and
Haynes now utlcmplcd to overtake
him

'l‘csti Loses Course

Tcsli, confused and unsure, went
out of the course at Hackctt Jr.
High School. This gave the lead to
the teachers. with Rickman in first
place. At this point the purple and
gold had men in the first seven
places giving them a chance to win
by a perfect score.

Testi, seeing his mistake, retraccd
his steps and quickly forged ahead
to fight doggedly for fourth position
with Russ and Francello. The boys
fought every inch of the way but
the Redinen with the prospects of
a perfect score against them deter-
minedly went ahead to beat them
out for place.

Delhi Meet Next

A week from to-morrow the hill
and dalers meet the Delhi Aggies
at home in the second n‘eet of the
season. The team that State is fac-
ing this year is not as formidable as
it was last year. The Delhians haVe
lost several lettermen through grad-
uation and have not as yet found
men to replace them. Last year the
barriers eked out a 26-29 victory.
This year, with a much stronger
team, State hopes to Win by as much
a perfect score as is possible.

However, it will be a hip and tuck
battle for cross-country supremacy
between the two schools. In running
Delhi the harrlcrs will go over a
shorter distance. and they have to
get used to this distance.

During the past week they have
bccn running over the 2.8 inllc
Washington Pork course. Haynes
and Wilczynski have been emphasiz-
ing a faster pace and a longer stride.
The freshmen, profiting by their
mistakes. have shown a vast lin-

‘provcmcnl in practice and are ex-

pcclcd to do much bcttcr against

Basketball Varsity
Continues Practice

Hatfield Stresses Set Shots
and Relaxed Shooting

 

Monday and Wednesday after-
noons saw State’s varsity basketball
squad being sent out through the
first actual practice sessions of the
current season. Coach Hatfield
placed special emphasis on set shots
as well as run-in cockups throughout
the week.

“The premium on good ball han-
dling” were the key words of Hat-
field's talk to the players Monday
afternoon. The fellows Were fur-
ther instructed to relax when shoot-
ing and to determine the angle at
which the ball will rebound off the
backboard.

Due to the appearance of the “fast
break” on the basketball court this
year as a result of the elimination
of the center tap, Coach Hatfield
will undoubtedly be forced to build
two teams of equal strength for the
coming campaign. Monday after-
noon, in the first scrimmage session
since practice began a month ago,
Mike Walko, Walt Simmons. Will
Frament, Tom Roberts and Merrill
Hill'd comprised one quintet. while
the other formation consisted of
Duke Hershkowitz, Bill Torrens.
Frank Quattrochi, Larry Balog, and
Bill Barrett.

Foot injuries kept Captain Tommy
Ryan out of Monday’s practice ses-
sion but Wednesday afternoon he
was back on the floor displaying a
bit of his old caglness.

To date there has been no varsity
cut, although one is expected to be
made in the immediate future.
Whether the elinilnatic'i of the
center top will have an effect on the
number of men kept on the varsity
roster is not known at present,

In their practice periods this week
a bunch of rollicking freshmen
busled themselves in the gym mak-
lng basketballs bounce all over the
floor iii an effort to put them
through the seemingly elusive hoop.
With the first cut of lhc season over,
Walko and Amyot have settled their
charges down to stiff workouts in an
ffort to formulate the nucleus of
the frosh team.

Socrclary Announces

Slate College Alumni Quarterly has

structor in English, is cdltor of the

Men’s Contests
End incomplete

The two fall tournaments, golf and
tennis, have been brought to a pre-
mature end through lack of interest.
Several rounds remained to be play-
ed when the tennis contest was call-
ed off Wednesday by Patsy Miran-
da, '38, manager of intramural ath-
lethS. In one bracket, the second
round had not been played. One
game remained to be played in the
golf tournament when it was ended.
also on Wednesday.

Interest ran rampant but in the
wrong direction. Rumor has it that
some of the players expect the tour-
nament to continue on next spring.
John O'Brien has stated that this
will not be an actuality. In fact. if
more interest is not shown in this
tournament, it will not be carried
on at all.

The outstanding feature of the
golf tournament was the number of
defaults which could be crowded in.
There were three games actually
played out of the total possible fif-
teen marked completed.

Naturally the fact that there were
so many defaults indicated the fact
that there was no interest. Since
tournaments such as these two can
be carried on only with co-operation.
it is again evident that their posi-
tion is critical. Patsy Miranda and
John O'Brien, ’38, president of M. A,
A.. have called repeatedly for inter-
est. Thcy are concerned with
hai'idling this program as the men
desire it. They can base their deei~
slons only upon the interest shown.
If the men of State are desirous of
retaining certain features of their
program, they must show that they
want the things which they have de-
clurcd themselves Willing to support.
