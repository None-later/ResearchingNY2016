The Honor System

The News feels that the New York
State College for Teachers should have an
honor system.

A Five Year Curriculum

On page 1 of this issue is Dr. A. R. Bru—
bache'r’s message to Myskauia concerning
curriculum changes for a five year curri-
culum.

 

  

 

    

  

  

 

It can be I‘cudily soon that a survey of
this sort can be valuable only with utmost
coopc'ulion from tho cnti-l‘o student body.
Necessarily, most of the questions can be
answered satisfactorily only by the seniors,
because of their knowledge of collcgo cour—
ses of tho uppcl'cluss lcycl. 'I‘ho seniors are
the only ones who can look back over lhoil'
past courses to dclcrnlillc wllolhor those

Appointment Bureau

 

 

Selection and Appointment of Teachers
Bulletin, 1932, No. 17
by W. S. Deffenbaugh and William H. Zeigel, Jr.
United States Government Printing Office
Washington, 115 pages

The purpose of the bulletin and its value to pros-
pective teachers is easily seen from these sentences
found in th first part of the book:

“Good teachers are a valuable asset to any school
system; poor teachers are a detriment. The latter are
expensive in that they require excessive amounts of
supervision and administration, frequently undo the
work of good teachers, are difficult to eliminate. and
often disturb the equilibrium and morale of the whole
teaching corps."

The bulletin is mainly composed of statistics,
tables and explanations being offered for every phase
of the teaching system. The number of teachers em—
ployed, percentage of new teachers in schools, and
tables outlining the restrictions on married teachers
are well presented.

One of the most interesting sections of the bulle-
tin dcalt with the discussion of the value of the ap-
plication photograph. A survey was conducted as to
the correlation of teaching ability and apparent teach-
ing ability as shown by a photograph. The findings
show that the coefficient of correlatir I is as low as
—.08. The photograph is valuable. however, for ob-
taining a “general impression of the candidate."

As the title of the bulletin suggests, the greater
part of the book is devoted to the listing of methods
by which teachers are selected. Appointment by sup-
erintendents, competitive examinations, and board and
principal selection are the chief methods. Others are
variations of one or more of these plans,

desk in the college library. Seniors and graduate stu—
dents are especially asked to acquaint themselves with
these books.

Commentstater

Fraternity pledges seem to be enjoying Hcll wcck
inordinately. In the commons. they paraded up and
down with unbounded enjoyment, cutting up capers,
advertising “unionized union suits." and sitting on the
floor contentcdly mulching on dog‘ buiscults while
joyously barking and whining In l'ino harmony.

We agree that to us onlookers and to the prod-
ding fI'aternlty members, all this Is comical and hum-
orous. But look at it from another side, Hazing
pledges cvinccs the childish and immature in us. Aft—
or all we are grown up: we should countenance lnorc

Experience Needed

Well Delivered Lines

 

 

__..._PLAYGOER.

 

 

 

Last Thursday evening the Ad-
vanced Dramatlcs class continued in
its experimental vein, and the re-
sults, even if not always entirely suc-
cessful, were nevertheless interesting.

The first play of the evening had
some fine bits of acting, but its mood
of farce was not sustained through-
out, so we could not always tell
whether we were laughing with or
at the players. The opening scene
might have set the tempo for us,
but neither Mr. Flatt nor Miss Hall
were sufficiently sure of themselves
to give us the cue, Mr. Platt did not
supply enough variety in voice or
gesture or movement to make the
scene the delightful one it missed
being. More experience is his chief
need.

The fathers were interesting and
for lho most part convincing. Mr.
Hart‘s performance was at times
delightful, But, Mr. Hart, wasn’t
even that gout real? It was a little
hard to believe when you jumped on
it so consistently. More variety

The weekend is over, and the girls
can settle down to a bit of study and
relaxation for a couple of days. With
the advent of the winter season, the
mad "rush" is upon us——take it easy.

Did We mention that there were a
few visitors in town for the dances?
At Psi Gamma were Annabelle Mc-
Connell Melville, ’31. and Dorothy
Griffin, ’34.

sigma Alpha drew a large quotn
with Betty McCombs, '33, Louise
Smith and Dorothy Brown Stillman,
'34, Inez Litts, ’35, Norma Blake and
Catherine Paris, both '36.

Helen Lomas, ’37, was a guest at
Eta Phi over the weekend, while the
KD's, “up the street a piece,” enter-
tained Dorothy Whyte, '36, and Betty
Morrow and Agnes Torrens of last
year’s class.

A foursome came to Pi Alpha Tau:
Jule Zull Pearl, ‘30, Lee Gellcrt, '33,
Shorlc Goldstone, and Lee chcns,
'36.

Note to props: The college outline
series is too familiar to our own aud-
iences to be mistaken for Romeo and
Juliet.

Miss Jesse’s play is such a beau-
tiful and moving play in itself that
our first impulse was to say. “won-
dcrful" and let it go at that. But
thc actual performance was, to a
markcd degree. very fine. Miss
Chrislcr knows how to deliver lines,

But at Limos tllcy departed from the

Fifty Students Enter

Ping Pong Tournament

The first round elimination of
the recently organized ping-pong
tournament, under the general
supervision of Joe Boslcy, ’39,
will start Monday with fifty men
making their bid for top honors.

Patsy Miranda, Chairman of
Intro-mural council, has an-
nounced that this tournament
will terminate at the end of the
month. According to Miranda,
Intro-mural council expects the
ping-pong tournament to be
completed when scheduled and
not subjected to the fate of the
tennis. horseshoe, and golf tour-
naments bcgun earlier this fall.

Bosley has asked that tourna'.
menl gamos be given preference
over other games played in the
Commons. “If tournament play-
ers who have previously signed
up for a match find the table in
use, they are requested to wait
untll the game in progress Is
completed before they begin
their mulch."

 

Hatfield Announces
Basketball Squads

(‘ouoll Io Sci Up Three Teams;
Lists (‘omplcte Varsity

Final cuts in bolll yearling and
varsity squads have been made this
wcok, Coach Hatfield will keep fif—
Iccli lncn in his squad through the
sollson, the number which he has at
present. Coaches Amyot and Walko
will keep thirtch working for the
freshmen.

Coach Hatfield will not even vcn-
tul'c a description of the varsity at
this early date. He hopes to set up
three teams. The first will be a fast
quintet, the wings of the squad. They
will also be the better shots and
therefore the eyes. Two other teams
will be forlncd so that their speed
will be less than that of the first.

Bull handling at present is not so
perfect, Couch stated, but he also
thought that this was not a serious
point sincc practice would improve
it quickly cnough. One group of five
which Couch has had working to-
gether is Quattrocchi, Balog, Hersh-
kowitz, Lehman, and Torrens.

Coaches Amyot and Walko are
having plenty of trouble in getting
their chnrgos in shape. They say
lhul if lho nymphs don't Improve
consldorably, they'll have to go back
lo the fundamentals of winch they
hnvc such an appalling luck of
