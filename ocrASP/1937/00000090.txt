dent. Each class will ot'fer four
songs including the Alma Motor,

l Wcll! all the practicing is over

‘much hurd work. both classes are
fairly aching for the contest and are
ircody to t‘ur cach otlicr apart.

' Thcl‘c is some doubt in the minds

,“Juniors and seniors. please note—

"the sophomore class is in 13-1 con-

lose is to have them all (throats) cut.

Stan Smith for the freshmen says,
.“It's a toss-up, with the freshman

appeal to your sense of fair play to
