Support Red Cross

Sponsored by Myskania, the annual Red

Cross drive will be under way in State
College on November 22 and 23.
The Red Cross needs no explanation,

apology or proof of its benefits to be put
before the public. This same public has
seen the Red Cross in the headlines innum-
erable times, working in regions from which
other beings fled in terror. As soon as dis-
aster hits a region, before the victims have
time to realize their danger and loss, this
unselfish organization is on the scene to
provide food, shelter, and comfort and to
alleviate suffering.

Naturally, an organization of this sort
has to depend upon the unselfish contribu-
tions from those who wish to help, many of
these people realizing that they may be
prospective users of this same fund. State
college, realizing the none too plentiful
means of its students is setting the mini-
mum at ten cents, During the drive show
your humaneness by exhibiting either ten
cents or a button.

 

On Cross Country

With the basketball season almost upon
us, it seems a fitting time to say something
about cross country. From a minor extra-
class sport existing only for the few who
were interested in running against their
own records, it has grown in powur and
prestige until it may now be said to be one
of State’s major sports.

The record of last year’s and this past
season’s successes is sufficient evidence to
establish the validity of the claim. The
planned schedule for next year will estab-
lish the sport in State college and State
college in the sports world. One of the
teams asking for a meet is Colgate; other
colleges are becoming interested. With
most of the excellent and experienced run-
ners underclassmen, next year’s team
should be strong. The best of luck to you,
State barriers.

 

 

Personal Viewpoints

 

 

Commentstater

We have heard in the past rumbles of rebellion
against the current curriculum in State college.
Through carrying out what Dr. Brubacher’s letter sug-
gested last week, these critics have a chance to express
their opinion and they may constructively improve the
organization of the school.

Of course, it goes without saying that we are not
dealing in personalities but in the construction of a
schedule of activities that will adequately prepare
State's students for the Job of teaching. Can you sug-
gest a method which will improve and modernize the
system as it proves inadequate? Have you any ideas
on how to improve the practice teaching and methods
courses in State so they would prepare you to face
Teaching's tripping tilts? Heated bull sessions have
heard many “redicals” denounce destructively the
whole order. What we'd like to know is whether or
not this is the usual amount of hot air or rather we
do have a few ‘thinkers' rather than hot 'airtists’
about our college.

A problem of any college, we have always felt, is
the fact that we do lose touch with the outside world.
We become too engrossed in our petty problems such as:
who are we going to take to prom?; what of our petty
politics?; and in our curriculum We often feel that we
study a subject Just for the mark at the end of the
semester rather than for the practical side of it. We
believe that at least the curriculum should be an ap-
proach to real life and though we feel that at present
We have no constructive ideas, at least we can have
some by April, and we feel sure that the members of
this student body, with their formal training of edu-
cation courses and the like, should be able to present
some practical suggestions. This is your school and
you'll always have to point to it as such; are you going
to point to it with pride as a progressive institution or
what? The cards are in your hand, it’s your deal, the
chips are showing, you can no longer bluff, you've got
to put Lip or shut up.

And now thanks for Thanksgiving. It comes at
just the right time—when your nerves are beginning
to become coffeeish and you’re beginning to lose your
perspective. Work, either at studies or on frittering
time away has caused most of us to become exhausted
and droopy so that when the old tWelve o’clock bell
rings next Wednesday we're going to feel as happy as
the Commons crowd always seems to be. We advise a
nice little rest from the tedium of the school day and
we know you’ll Just rush back with a Postumlike
bounce. We are badly in need of sleep ourselves and
intend to spend the entire time upon two subjects,
gourging ourselves with food and sleeping all day the
rest of the time. We'll be relieved as the ventilators
after Mascot hunt when We get that needed sleep.

 

Another thing that we’re afraid of is that the
student body may be losing interest in the Constitu-
tional assembly. It really has been stressed a lot but
we think the main trouble is too much time being spent
on trivia and not enough speed towards the ultimate
ends of the assembly. We do not feel that it is Leonard
Friedlander's fault but rather do we believe that he
has not received the cooperation which he should be
able to expect. At their last meeting we felt there was
a little too much qulbbling about technicalities. Now,
this may be very interesting to our par-limentarlans——
but to us ordinary mortals it is a trifle boring. We'd
like to see this thing go over with a bang and not up
with one. For these reasons we'd like to suggest that
the students give Len a little more cooperation and
that people who are not interested in the thing at all,
except for their own personal prestige, or to develop
their art of argumentation, get outuscram. We'd like
to suggest that now that the ground work is complete
that the matters of interest to State students be
brought up in the assembly and the dull and dry com—
mittee work be left to the committee, We are all for
you and we believe with the right type of publicity
you’ll have something there, but for heaven's sakes.
make it interesting to us morons.

And as this column seems to be devoted mostly to
union and organization, lnscpumblc—we'll continue in
the same Vein. What eVer happened to the idea of
All-State dances. We Went to one last spring and had
as much fun as a monkey at a county fair. It was
swell, no kidding, and why no more? It was an in-
expensive way to come into contact with the whole
college as one usually only does at formal and costly
dances. We had a fair orchestra and the crowd was
out to have a good time and had it and it was not
the drain on the boy’s pocketbook that even a movie
date would exceed. We'd truthfully like to see more
times when the fellows could drag their latest sleep-
loser to an inexpensive social function which would aid
in uniting the college. We hope you aren't asleep now,
but if you are remember that Thanksgiving is right
around the precipice.

State ’3 Stage

Bouquets

Brickbats

 

.__...__PLAYGOER

Tuesday evening's plays were re-
ceived by another large audience.
We are glad to see that the plays
are being so well-attended, for the
class is continuing to do a great
many worthwhile things. Miss
Furey's play was handicapped by an
unfortunate technical difficulty,
which, we later learned, could not
have been foreseen or avoided; but
in spite of this, the clever comedy
lines got over to an enthusiastic au—
dience.

Miss Hayford was very well cast
and made the character she por-
trayed a convincing one. Mr
Walsh acted a bit too much on the
college-boy type, but he had some
very good spots, especially in the
last scene.

Too much of the play, however,
was played for up stage with the
actors hidden by furniture. Many
stage pictures, too, were confused.
Miss Walsh had to play most of her
best lines Lip-stage. She displayed.

however, a very appealing stage'

presence. We should like to see
more of her work.

We felt that the set for that type
play might have been more interest-
ing. And, please, costme committee,
a more careful attention to colors.
The peach and red in the opening
scene was probably Bohemian but
it was a little hard on the eyes

Miss Lockwood's play was such a
difficult undertaking that she is to
be congratulated for the wonderful
smoothness and clicctivmess of the
performance. Several men new to
State‘s stage made on appearance,
and we are looking forward to see—
ing more of them.

Mr. Weiss has a fine voice, and
seemed well-suited to thul. rugged
type of part. His scenes with his
wife, howover. were better than the
ones with the sailors. in those
latter scenes we felt that he might
have been much harsher, and more
cl'lu'l. O'Neill‘s brutes, Mr. Weiss,
ul‘c are not to be crossed.

Miss Mlnst’s, of course, was the
performance of the evening. I-ler
m-nsithc and uuiturc hundllng ol
the port set if high mark for future
Advanced Druniutics nctl‘cssos to
him at Mr, Dorun's bit was finely
done. He is one of our few players
who can make an accent convincing,
but we could not see enough of his
facial expression.

The set was really line, and dell—
nltely in keeping with the mood of
the play, but, although the first
impression of the lighting seemed
to strike Just the right note, we be-
gun to regret it as the play went on.

Again, We are glad to see the class
attempting ambitious things, and
we hope that they continue to re-

 

ceive the this support of the student
body and their friends.

 

 

 

Statesman

 

Well folks, here We are again . . .
There isn’t much to say, (there never
is) but We aim to please . . . as ever.

First and foremost we wish to tell
the author of that very nasty letter
which was signed Oscar Q. Schnaz-
zlepuss, that, if he expects to have
that sort of trash published in this
respectable (?) column, he must sign
his name. The News (long live the
News!!!) does not print material
received in anonymous letters.

Now that that’s off our chest, we
want to know where a certain senior
learned how to skin the cat With the
grace of a nightingale. The vesti-
bule of a trolley car is no place to
practice though.

O’Hora has found new fields to
conquer and seems to be doing quite
well.

Observed at Advanced Dramatics
play , . . Edge and Jane, Larry and
Rita . . . scandal, I’ll say.

Santi didn't aide over the week—
end. What's the matter kid?
(Scoop?)

Stan, why did the lass with the
slumberous optics leave via the win-
dow? Don't you know that it isn't
proper?

Just wait folks—things will Chris
(llize) around KD if the photogra-
pher from Back Bay doesn’t act a
little less Ginny.

Grad Foland never previously
seemed to get enough of good old
S. C. T., but he seemed to have a
Neff Saturday evening.

Commons gossip: Crounse doing
the Big Apple-durn well the other
noon . . . Minny seems to have mov-
ed from Lake Ave. to Western Ave.
Was it because Wobble studies at
Psi Gam, Minny?

Ned says (a) Ruby is his favorite
gem. It looks that way.

Sully, it's time you found out that
Marion is a one man girl. Stay
away, his dukes are hard.

Since she lost that dexter(ous)
touch there is less mlns(t)ing around
school.

We predict that Bob will again be
a frequent visitor to Green Island.
He couldn't get located any other
place.

Max usually know(le)s what he is
doing, but he is married now.

It’s the bull around Brucker we
think, (Ed. note: So does everyone
else.)

Before We close here is some ad—
vice to the frosh.

It is time for the rush-bug . . .

ternationally famous skiier. Miss
Hoyt is leaving for Europe early in
December as a member of the Amer-
lean Girl's Ski Squad to participate
in various types of ski races all over
the continent, At the tea she will
speak of methods of arousing inter-
est in skiing. how to obtain the
greatest enjoyment from skiing and
seine of her more thrilling skiing
experiences. She will also provide
a display of books on skiing, which
should prove of interest to veterans
or beginners.

sport clothing shop in Albany, will
give a style show. Incorporated with
the women's fashions will be sain-
ples of what the well-dressed sports-
man will wear this season. The two

sophomores To  F
Freshmen In Rivalry

With fifty rough and ready
freshmen and sophomores rear-
ing to go, rivalry will continue
this afternoon at 3:30 on the
Dorm field in the form of a
football contest.

Although eleven men consti-
tutes a team, each class will
have plenty of men in reserve
to take the place of those injur-
ed in the battle.

According to Joe McKeon, '40,
head of the sophomore eleven,
the game will be played under
the regular intercollegiate foot-
ball rulings with the exception
that there'll be no tackling. To
get the pigskin carrier the boys
will have to touch him on or
about his “seat of gravity."
Johnny O'Brien, '37, will be the
official referee.

Stale Harriers
Lose Last Meet
To Delhi Aggies

Victors Set New Record;
Wilczynski of State
Comes in Second

Mai-ring the Purple and Gold’s
long string of victories, a strong, well
balanced Delhi team nosed out the
Pedagogues, 20-35, at the same time
breaking a two year record for the
2.8 mile distance to take the final
meet of the season last Saturday
afternoon. '

Two years ago the Rams let the
record of 13:45 for the 2.8 mile
Washington course be broken by
Gary of Delhi who came in the time
breaking 12:41. This came close to
setting a new intercollegiate record
with Cary doing an average mile in
4:31.

Showing both teams to be in tip
top form, the first fourteen runners
came in under the old mark of 13:45.
Also showing the closeness of the
race, the time separating the win-
ner from the tenth man was 23 sec-
ends.

Starting over a muddy, slippery
course in the rain, the two teams al-
ternately took the lead until at the
halfway mark at the penitentiary,
the Rams, in close team formation,
took a commanding lead over the
Purple and Gold.

With the finish coming closer the
State harriers increased their pace
to catch up with the Hillbillys, and
during the last mile both teams were
sprinting. the Rams to keep their
advantage, and the Pods to cut their
opponents' lead.

Tony Wilczynski, ’39, came in on
Cary’s heels, one second behind him.
Frank Rickman, '40, coming in sixth

~ place, prevented a too complete shut-

out ln the scoring. Louis Francello,
’40, Walt Russ, ’39, getting into their
stride, were too far behind to do
much,

With the excellent prospect of
having slx or seven meets next year,
plus the fact that the team loses
only one man through graduation,
things look very bright for the team
next year. Four letter men will re-
turn to form the backbone of the
team. They will be helped by the
return of Steve Swazalowski, '40,
who was forced to quit cross-country
this year because of chronic appen-
dicitis troubles.

W. D. R.

After reading your article of this
past week, I have been stimulated to
write a reply in the hope that it
may find print.

I agree that your analogy of the
great sophomore team of Rockne
and our college basketball team was
well-founded; I also agree that a
winning team should not be broken
up. What happened to Terry’s win-
ning Giants when he broke them up
after the 1933 campaign? Terry did
not possess the experience and
shrewdness of Connie Mack who
kept his ’29, ’30, and '31 teams intact.
I am of the belief that our basket-
ball team of last year that won the
last five or six games should be ai-
lowcd to profit by the experience of
Mack in keeping together rather
than to split them up as did Terry,
and fail to come through to victory.

“Onlookcr”

Not to be too, critical . . . but we
believe that “Onlookcr” made a seri-
ous grammatical error in his last
sentence , . , can you find IT? . . .
however, we appreciate the argument
given in his letter . . . we'd like to
add to it though . . . what happened
to Connie Mack after he did sell
out his players? . . . hasn't he been
in the cellar ever since? . . .

We're looking forward to the
Soph-Frosh football game this 1). m.
. . . with extra special enthusiasm . . .
remember sophs . . . the frosh
weren’t any slouches in pushball . . .
and don't let anyone kid you about
this idea of 2-hand "touch" football
. . . those “touches” aren't any love
taps. . . .

Tonight our practice school opens
its basketball season against St.
Joseph’s on the Page hall court . . .
keep an “eye” on the Milnites this
year . . . they’re going places . . .

Joseph Melanson wrote fourteen
letters this past week to the ol'
grads . . . inviting them to vie with
the varsity on December 3 in State’s
opening game of the season . . . this
engagement means that the Hatfield
