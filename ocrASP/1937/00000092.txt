‘Tﬁutch Treat”Dating
Becomes College Issue

by David Minsberg

Your inquiring reporter sits down
to write with a smirk on his face——
and can you blame him—it was a
very pleasant job he chose; in toto,
interviewing and hounding all the
beauties at State college. As usual
we started on the freshmen. We
accosted Ginny McDermott in the
hall and she seemed not to resent
it so we proceeded with this ques-
tion, “Do you favor ‘dutch treats’ on
a date, that is each party paying his
own expenses?" “What! definitely
not!” She stamped her foot indig-
nantly, “Do you think I'm going to
pay a fellow to take me out?" Cow-
ed, We quietly sneaked off into a
corner for a half-hour until We re-
gained our bravado, and then decid-
ed that the mens’ viewpoint would
be more welcome.

Arnold Ellerin, a young, innocent-
looking freshman, was the next vic-
tim. To the query Ellerin answered
gravely. “Once in a while it’s all
right, but the fellow should not make
a habit of paying."

 

We left this wise fresh and ap-

proached two sophomores. “Toac”‘

Fairbanks, who was busy, answered
gruffly, “Custom being what it is.
and I having money in my pockets.
I’ll prefer to pay the way." Ap—
proaching Doris Shultes with pre-
caution (remembering our experience
with that freshman) We received a
more verbose reply: “If the fellow
and girl go around for a long time,
then it’s different. Besides girls as
a rule don't have money, and the
fellow work, so . . . ”

The juniors were more solidified
in their opinion. Marion Minst said,
“If the fellow brings it up, he should
pay." Dee Jesse exclaimed, “It‘s
a terrible idea. I‘d rather stay
home." Eddie Cassavant said, with
mature sagacity, “In an informal
date, it's all right but it would be
embarrassing in a formal date.”
Representing the junior men is Joe
Wells. We cornered him and he
finally gave this off, “I wouldn't
like it. I’d feel kinda foolish propos-
ing the idea of paying to her."

It was among the seniors, however,
that we found the most diversified
comment. Millie Nightingale re-
plied, “It’s not a bad idea in a way;
but let me go no farther than to say
that I will not cater to such an idea
under any circumstances." Paul
Dittman confined himself to the
brief remark, “Yes, a great idea—if
she’s a rich widow." Our Campus
Queen, in one of her more condes-
cending moods, retorted to our query
in this wise, “I'm afraid to say that

Q.
I favor them, because I’m liable to

make myself too popular on the
campus." Our other pulchritudinous
assay was Muriel Goldberg. She,
with that Myskanial attitude, an-
swered, “Is this another case where
it's the woman who pays?” John
O’Brien summed up the thought of
the male student body in his concise
statement, “If she's willing why I
won't try hard to stop her.”

Assembly invites
Prominent Men

To [illness Body

Leaders in State Affairs,
Business Men to Talk
On Current Issues

In an effort to provide accurate
information on government and cur~
rent politics for the state's future
teachers, Leonard Fricdlandcr, '39,
speaker of the Constitutional assem-
bly announced today that leaders in
the state government, prominent
business and professional men, have
been invited to speak, and submit
to cross—questioning at public hear-
ings on the controversial issues in-
troduced at recent sessions of the
Assembly.

Whether or not New York state is
to have socialized medicine will con-
cern the members of the assembly at
its next meeting. Tuesday, December
14.

Following the aims of the Assem-
bly as set forth in its constitution,
members of the group have arranged
to speak before high school assem-
blies, in the Capital district. Ac—
cording to members of the faculty.
it has been learned that State
college‘s inauguration of the assem-
bly plan for active participation in
government has attracted the atten-
tion of the State department, and
that similliir groups are to be set
up in secondary schools throughout
the state modeled on our assembly.

Included in the list of resolutions
introduced at the last meeting of
the Consiiintiennl assembly are the
following:

“Resolved that this assembly go
on record in favor of an amendment

tration of voters in mandatory elec-
tion procedure."

“Resolved that this assembly favor

Chem. Club Celebrates

Ag (Silver) Annwersary

Shades of 2,2 di-methyl, 4 iso-
propyl, 5, 6, cil—ethyl nonatrie-
enyne, 3, 5, 71 The Chemistry
club celebrated its silver anni-
versary with a sumptuous spread
in the cafeteria Tuesday night.
Past presidents were much in
evidence, as President Mollen-
kopf introduced assistant profes-
sor William Kennedy, who was
the first president of the club
when it was organized in 1912,
and Mrs. Kennedy of the class
of 1914; Miss Gladys Crodgc,
1922-23; Clyde Slocum, 1928, and
Miss Irma Melthouse, 1931. Wil-
liam Fullagar, '30, and Ray Fisk,
‘37, were expected, but were evi-
dently lost on the way. Professor
Barnard S, Bronson and other
members of the chemistry de-
partment were also present.

After what consensus of opin-
ion indicatcs was one of the
most satisfying meals, (unlimit—
ed 1ce cream), in the history of
cafeteria banquets, the club ad-
journed to room 250, where a
horde of neophytcs were initia-
tcd into membership, upon pres-
entation of skits for the edifica-
tion of their elders. One eager
aspirant was introduced to H2O
through the medium of a funnel,
while President Mollenkopf and
the faculty came in for unex—
pected ribbings.

lFamous LectWer
Will Comment
On World Affairs

American Neutrality to be
Subject of Discussion
In Assembly Today

Harrison Brown, famed journalist
and world traveler, will lecture in
assembly today, according to Warren
Dcnsmore, ’38, president of student
association. The topic of his lecture
will be “Can America Be Neutral?"

Mr. Brown is a prominent writer
and lecturer on international affairs.
He graduated from Oxford and is a
regular contributor to the London
Spectator and Continental Review.
He has seen service in the British
army during the war. Mr. Brown
has followed avidly European affairs
and is in close contact with Euro-
pean statesmen. A few years ago,
he wrote “background” articles on
social, economic and political con-
ditions in Scandinavia, Russia,
Japan and China. These articles
have been syndicated in four foreign
countries and have been widely read
by students of international affairs.

To get his “background” informa-
tion in China, Mr, Brown wandered
off the beaten track in the interior
of China for three months. He in-
terviewed the Chinese leaders in
the recent rebellion and get their
viewpoints in regard to Japanese
aggression. Between 1928-33, he re-
sided in Berlin and wrote commen-
taries on the German government
up to the occupation of the Hitler
regime.

His first address was a round table
discussion in the Lounge yesterday
afternoon upon the topic “Awaken-
ing the Chinese." His lecture in to-
day's assembly is “Can America be
Neutral.” Then tonight, he will have
a group discussion on “Fascism and
Communism.”
