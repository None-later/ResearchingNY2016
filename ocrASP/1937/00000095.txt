Mount Your Hobby Horse Now

Under the auspices of the Junior Guides,
various hobby groups are being started in
the college.

The first of these, a dancing group, is
easily the most important. Teachers, be-
side being expected to pore through vol-
umes, will also be required to attend the
Podunk Iligh School Junior Prom, or, as
:‘s far from conjectured, will be asked to
start a dancing class. Then, too, knowing
how to dance tends to make one more apt
to like parties and mingling with people.
We view with genuine appreciation the pro-
vision for the shy aspirants to terpsichorean
perfection.

The proposed orchestra and photography
clubs will probably meet with harder sled-
ding than the dancing club. They will de-
mand a great deal of time, that dimension
far from infinite for the average State col-
lege student.

The greatest difficulty to be seen is that
the leaders of those activities, the Junior
Guides, are undoubtedly one of the busiest
groups of people in the school. For their
benefit and for the benefit of the clubs.
sponsored the leaders of these clubs should
be people with ample time to devote to
what should be their most well-loved hobby.

Fraternities and Fun

 

 

COMMENTSTATER

Again State college’s relatively untried interfra-
ternity council has shown itself worthy. As was to be
expected fraternity rushing this year was carried off
with more ease and less scramble than even last year's

highly successful inauguration of the system.
III zl: Ir a It

 

 

Present freshmen and sophomores are well un-
acquainted with the methods that preceded their time.
No longer can there be any room for the complaints
that freshmen men are herded into an organization
by fair means or foul, before they are capable of judg-
ing for themselves what college is all about.

And no longer is it necessary for the fraternities
to bid frosh before they get to know them as they
really are, thanks to delayed bidding and its adequate
protection from first impressions.

And the social advantages of the organization are
not to be overlooked. Last year’s formal was a high-
light of the season, and this year the group plans no
exception.

But aside from that, the future holds even more
interesting prospects. What with a third fraternity
already recognized on the campus, and, if We may
credit rumor, a fourth to come, there will be a still
more urgent need for unity among the groups—a unity
expressed ideally by the present organization.

a at >l= it i

Let's Just remember that the fraternities (criticize
them if you will) do serve a definite need at college.
Think about that, Think about the vistas they conjure
up: social life; lifelong friendships; political influence;
learning those little quirks and fancies of living with
people (and you’d be surprised at the number of frosh
who have to learn!)

You’ll soon see the need. Sure, some adapt
themselves to it in other ways, but we say that some
don’t, and there’s your raison d’etre of fraternities and
our highly successful Inter-fraternity council.

it 4! II It AI

And we don’t know how interested you are, but
in the Co-op there is—of all things—a book that pur-
ports to be a manual of the subtle art of getting pass
ing marks, known to us under many various and
sundry names. We haven’t read it, but the advertlse-
ments make it sound good.

 

Appointment Bureau,

 

 

The Appointment Bureau urges all students who
will be going home for the Christmas holidays to take
special notice of any vacancies that may be open in
the teaching profession, and to communicate with the
Appointment Bureau If such vacancies are found.
Your chances at a job are better only because some—
body clse has established leads for you. Help yourself
and future State people to the teaching jobs In the

After devoting the first chapter to a discussion on
the history of his problem, Mr. Fisher turns to the
task of listing results of quostlonaircs received from
various teacher training institutions. In his own
words, he believes that “the specific knowledges sup-
plicd by a teacher training institution are the best in-
dlcallon of the extent to which that institution recog-
nlzcs the need for them.” The knowledge which was
supplied by the most colleges and considered Import-
ant by the largest number of placement officers was
an “understanding of the standards Imposch by the

We are always intensely amus-
ed and secretly cynical of the
grand floor show staged by the
fairl?) sex after basketball
games. To further our fun we've
evolved a little pleasantry for
future dates, and the following
rules apply. First: each sorority
shall have a roped off area in
which to herd the sheep. The
object of the game is to see
which of the 14 groups can gar-
ner the most frosh into their
pen. Then, as the music blares,
the girls are to each grab a
fresh, and do the ‘palsy walk.’

This will end all stiletto stares
and peace will reign if the ropes
don’t burn. No one, as usual,
has thought of the men at this
time. So, we have arranged fora
roped enclosure in the floor’s
center for the male element.
Then, so they will have the
pleasure of the lipstick spread-
er’s company we have invited
one hundred beautiful Russell
Sage girls and one hundred pul-
chritudinous Skidmore lasses.
Oke, State?

his neighbor. Murder will out

Statesman

 

 

 

Well, folks, here we are again with
the dope on one of the most talked
about people in college: the States-
man. At the basketball game Satur-
day p. m. he wore a plaid shirt and a
blue bow tie. He also danced, but
so did hundreds of others. With
information like that, everyone
should know who we are. Oh yeah!

Speak for yourself, John . . . only
speak sooner. If you Parrot Lons-
dale’s words, you have to pull the
bow over the strings on the fiddle in
the second row.

It took Fred quite a while to settle
down, but over the week end it look-
ed like Peg to us.

The most heard question in and
around school this week was “Did
you get one?" That’s right, we
mean these forerunners of evil and
destruction, billrt-doux and warn-
ings. Don’t worry if you were slight-
ed this time. Your chance to join
State’s Hall of Fame l?) may come
next semester. Believe it or not the
Statesman missed twice, so there.

Memories, — just memories — for
Hall. Hayford and Strong, but it was
a lot of fun anyway.

STATE COLIJ‘L‘GE NEWS, DECEMBER m, 1937

It Varsity to Meet

With the possibilities of a new
combination opening to m o r r o w
night's game, the Purple and Gold
cagers traVel to Troy to battle State’s
traditional foe for top honors by
seeking its third straight victory for
the season.

Christmas Trip

Just as the Christmas recess be-

- gins, the basketeers go on the road to

meet St. Michael’s College, at Win-
ooski, Vermont, on December 16th
and Norwich College at Northficld,
Vermont on the following day.

The Purple and Gold hoopsters
split with St. Michael's, the “gallop-
ping sophomores" winning to the
tune, 38-29. St. Michael's, having a
veteran team untouched by grad-
uation. is out for blood, and is pre-
pared to give our boys a very warm
Welcome.

Norwich, too, is keenly looking for-
ward to the tussle with the “golden
lions." Whether the lions will roar
with victory or because its tail has
,been pulled, is yet to be seen.

Coach Elliot G. Hatfield, dis-
satisfied with the showing in com-
petition thus far. is working out var-
ious combinations to improve the
team's playing and do away with

 

that have been so evident in the past
two games.

, Last year State split with R. P. I.
.‘The Hatfield aggregation won the
second game with the “galloping
sophomores" doing stellar work to
Iprovide the Trojans with a stunning
'upsct, 32-27. The Troy cagers tried
Ivaliantly to hold back the Feds but
Iwithout success. The shots of
[Levonian and Gilcoync brought
,checrs from the State section, and
,lhc diminutive but poworful R, P. I,
quintet were paid tribute by the
l Pcds.

it. P. I. Losses

, Although R. P. I. should have the
lodge on Slate with the game being
lplaycd on the home court, this ad-
‘vanlagc is lost due to the severe
‘handicap of the graduation of
practically its entire team last June.

The lctlcrmcn returning this year
;arc Captain King Ward, Chris
lll'axiola, and Follows. The loss of
Silvcra. Safford, and chonlan will
be sorely felt. Agnell, last year’s
number one pivot man and all round
,shifty, will not be there to stem the
IPurplc and Gold lidc.
, With the new rulings favoring
lsmailer faster teams, the Trojans
should ovcrcomc this handicap of
,graduating losses.
l Coach Donald‘s starting line-up
for the games will no doubt Include
Captain King Ward and Ed Bone-
stccl, guards; Ed Ahflcld, center:
Chris Fazlola and George Shake,
forwards.

State Losses
State has also lost men through
,graduation. They are, however, not
very much affected by this loss.

plus Tommy ltyInI, captain.
Starting Lineup
; Conch Hatfield's probable starting
gllno up will include Captain Tommy
'Ryan, and Duke Hershkowltz at the
guard posllions; "Wheezc" Lehman
at the tap—off. and Will Frnmcnt
with Walt Simmons at the forward
spots, The second I-latflcld com-

Purple and Gold Overcome
Alumni 43-35; Defeat
Bard Cagers 49-45

A sweeping 43-35 victory of last
Friday night over the Alumni, to
be followed with a hard fought 49-45
win over the Bard aggregation on
Saturday night, formed a fitting
opening for the Hatfield basket-
ballers' current season.

In their opener, the statesmen
found the grads a troublesome ad-
versary. Piling up an early 10 point
lead, the undergraduates were set
for a coasting victory, but a spirited
Alumni squadron decided adversely
and with Dick Margison touching
off the fireworks, the grads proceed-
ed to give the practice teachers
plenty of trouble,

With the opening of the second
quarter of the final half, Tommy
Barrington, Jerry Amyot and Johnny
Ryan began to swish the net with
long, set shots, Repeatedly the grads
made desperate attempts to even
the count with the undergraduates,
but each time the Hatfield aggrega-
tion's early first stanza lead proved
a most impregnable obstacle.

In Saturday night’s fracas the

Purple and Gold broke off to an
early 10-point lead but with Captain
Stcarncs paving the shortest way
to the net, the Annandale crcw slow-
ly broke down the advantage.
, Trailing 22-10 as the second half
swung under way, a fast—shooting
Bard quintet took the floor to con-
tinually even up the scoreboard fig—
ures. However, the Teachers were
not to be stopped and matched the
boys from “down the river" basket
for basket. It was once again the
early lead gained in the first few
minutes of play of the initial period
that enabled the Teachers to (301110
through to victory.

Mont Pleasant
Tops FroslI Five

Freshman Cagera to Meet
Trojan Yearling Five
On R. P, 1. Court

Bowing to the tune of 43-8 before
a powerful Mont Pleasant squad last
Saturday night the fresh showed a
decided lack of basketball experi-
ence and speed. The Dorphians
“snowed under" the first-year men
and a decisive trimming was evident
after the opening few minutes of
play.

Tomorrow night the “A8: W” men

will journey with the varsity to Troy
where they will tackle the R. P. I.
frosh in the preliminary to the main
go. Last year against the Trojans,
the class of '40 represented State
college well.
On the R. P. I. court the trash, as
did the varsity, went down to a
27-20 defeat. However, later in the
season on the Page hall gym, the
Harrington—coached squad eked out
a 32-27 Win over the Engineers .

During the past week Amyot and
Walko have been driving the frosh
through long drawn out practice
sessions in anticipation of tomorrow’s
contest.

A week from tonight, their tra-
ditional rival, Milne high, will match
forces with them on the Page hall
court. Practically the entire Milne
High squad which faced the fresh
last year will take the floor against
the class of ’41.

It was this same squad that re-
ceived two setbacks from the Teach-
ers last year, and a victory for the
Milnitcs would make up, at least in
part, for those two losses. In the
first of last year's fracases, the frosh
took a close 26-22 victory and in the
second, by virtue of Walt Harper’s
foul toss, the fresh claimed a very
narrow 29-28 decision.

The starting lineup for tomorrow's
contest will be: Walt Daniclwicz and
Charlie Quinn or Jerry Saddlemire
taking the forward posts; Roy Mc-
Crcary or Johnny Yatsenik at the
pivot position, and Phil Sullivan and
Patsy Turino or Joe Schwartz at the
guard berths.
