Doctors to Have Diocuuion
On ‘Socialized Medicine'
Before Open Forum

The Constitutional convention as-
sembly conducted a heated discus-
sion on the unicameral legislature
on Tuesday, December '1, at 3:30
o’clock in room 206 of Draper hall.
The report of the hearing commit-
tee, headed by Sally Whelan, ’38, on
unicameralism provoked so much
interest and debate that final deci-
sion was postponed until the next
meeting of the assembly. Until that
time, a great deal of argument, both
pro and con, will be heard by the as-
sembly.

A committee discussing “Irres-
ponsible Labor Groups," headed by
Betty Hayford, ’39, conducted a pub-
lic hearing at noon Tuesday. Mr.
Adam A. Walker, professor of eco-
nomics and sociology, was requested

by the group to give his opinion in'

regard to labor groups. Professor
Walker, in his speech, pointed out
the fact that the formation of labor
organizations does not mean that
they are irresponsible.

“Socialized Medicine” is one of
the topics to be undertaken by a
hearing committee, headed by Ed-
more Melanson, '39, sometime next
week. It intends to have a public
hearing at which time a supporter
of the plan, a New York State De-
partment of Health Official, and a
local physician, opposing the plan,
will be cross-questioned by the group.
Students who are interested in this
topic are welcome to attend the dis-
cussion which will be conducted in
room 206.

During Christmas vacation, the
senatorial publicity directors will
attempt to contact newspaper editors
and high schools of New York state.
Its purpose will be to publicize the
activities of the convention and its
issues.

The thirty-first congressional dis-
trict of Schenectady, headed by
Sadie Flax, '40, has spoken before
Journalism clubs and current events
groups in the high schools of that
city. A prominent high school of
the city published a convention issue
after the committee had spoken
there. Gerry Ewing, ’40, and Bea-
trice Shufelt, '40, accompanied Miss
Flax on her tour of the schools.

Art Department Shows Sketches

0f Bridgman,

per, your inquisitive reporter noticed,
Wondered, and naturally found out
about the figure drawings on exhibit
there.

They are the sketches of the Mr.
George B. Bridgman, world-wide
lecturer and instructor, and member
of the Art Students League in New
York City.

Upon further inquiry, your report-
er found that the Fine Arts depart-
ment has been fortunate in obtain-
ing about one hundred sketches
which Mr. Bridgman draws to illus-
trate and bring out his points clear—
ly in his lectures.

Change of Panels
According to Miss Perine, assist-
ant professor of fine arts. there will
be a change of these panel sketches
so that all one hundred will be on
exhibit. Miss Perine says she will
gladly give whatever spare time she
has in explaining the sketches.

At the present, there are four
panel sketches in Draper. One de-
picts the rage of Miles Standish and
is an application in showing how
figures are used to obtain expression.
On the Miles Standish figure you
can see a fierceness of face in op-
position to the trembling knees.

Art’s Uses

The Art history class, having the
“Development of Greek Art” as a
term topic, is using the sketches to
full advantage. They are using
them in connection with figure
drawing and are studying it for an-
preciation of sculpture and statuary;
the class in drawing has found them
useful in connection with drafting.

Student Museum

Wandering among the maze of in-
teresting projects of the students,
your nosing reporter lighted on a
miniature museum of intricate fig-
ures.

Miss Perine said that this exhibit
was the work of last year’s Art his-
tory class, and the especial work of
George Ketchum, '37, and Wilbur
Valley, '40.

This exhibit represents the ad-
vance or evolution of Greek sculp-
ture from the archaic period to the
decadent Hellenistic period. It is
planned by this year's class to ex—
tend the exhibit from the Hellenistic
period down through the Roman to
the Renaissance,

The idea for the “Little Museum"
was the creation of Lorado Taft, a
man who is one of America’s fore-
most autl‘ioritlcs on Greek sculpture.
lie says that art history is not a
Jun'iblu of dates, but a steady prog-
ress of events and achievements all
interrelated.
