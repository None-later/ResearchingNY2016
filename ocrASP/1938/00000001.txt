Chorus to Have
Winter Concert

Music Council Will Present
Toscha Seidel, Violinist,
As Guest Artist

Music council will present the
State College Choral Society under
the direction of Dr. T. Frederick H.
Candiyn, assistant professor of
music, in its annual winter concert
next Friday night in Chancellor's
hall at 8:30 o'clock.

Toscha Seidel, world famed violin-
ist. will be the assisting artist, ac-
cording to an announcement by
Muriel Goldberg, ’38, president of
Music council.

Mr. Seidel was born in Odessa,
Russia, and displayed musical genius
from an early age. His first teacher
was Max Fiedelman, a pupil of
Leopold Auer. Later Seidel attend-
ed Sternches Conservatorium in Ber-
lin, and, following this, studied un-
der Auer himself.

The violinist made his debut in
Oslo, Norway, at the age of fourteen,
His fame spread over Europe and he
toured the Continent for three years
before coming to America. Seidel’s
American debut was made in Car-
negie hall, New York, and here be
exceeded even the triumphs of his
European successes. Annual trans—
continental tours then followed, and
then he started a world tour, includ-
ing England, France, Australia, New
Zealand, Hawaii, and Central Amer-
ica in his journey. This was a bril-
liant success, and was succeeded by
another tour of Europe.

Mr. Seidel plays a Stradivarius

.Its value is estimated at $60,000.
Some artists have a warmth of
tone which leads their way to fame;
others are lauded for their superb
technique, Toscha Seidel combines
both assets with a deep feeling for
and understanding of music which
has electrified his audiences and has
caused many to call him the most
brilliant of all the world-famous
musicians who studied under Auer.
Miss Goldberg is general chairman
of the presentation, and Dorothy
Cain, ‘38, is chairman of arrange—
ments. Betty Baker and Margaret
Mattison, juniors, are in charge of
tickets and publicity respectively,
and Lillian Rivkind and Alice

grammed gavel in token of his ser-
vices as hcad 01' the group,

Especially emphasized in the ad-
dresses and forums was the topic of
citizenship—its maintenance and

|interest on the part of our citizens
will, I am confident, result in a more
constructive Convention as well as
increase the likelihood of the adop-
tion by the people of the proposed
new Constitution when it is submit-
ted to them in November. It is
therefore very encouraging to note
that the student body of the State
College for Teachers is taking an
active interest in the Constitutional
Convention. I hope that interest
will be maintained until the propos~
ed new Constitution has been voted
on by the people."

The Governor referred the Speak-
er to the “non-partisan and non-
poiiticai committee to collect and
prepare data for the information of
the delegates to the Convention"

tory note, Friedlander said, “I am
very pleased to receive the Gover-

Excellency's recognition of the State
College Constitutional Assembly. I
am happy to see that State college

zens of New York State."
