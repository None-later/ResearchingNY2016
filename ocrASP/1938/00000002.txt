Rah, Rah --.3

The sophomores have recently voiced a
desire to establish “hazing” rules for fresh-
men, and their wishes have been granted.
The sophomore class believes that State col-
lege is not collegiate enough, that it should
have more of the college spirit behind it.
Since this objective cannot be accomplished
by informal skirmishes the class has decid-
ed to legalize some of their ideas for rival-
ry, class spirit, and college spirit. The plan
which will go into effect with the class of
1942 is for the freshmen to wear caps of
their class color from September until
Christmas vacation.

The NEWS hereby extends to its readers
the opportunity to voice opinions on this
topic. Do you believe that State college
lacks fire, pep, and collegiate escapades?
Or are you one of those who believes that
State college, as a teacher training institu-
tion, should be ultra-conservative in its ser-
ious task? Or do you believe in both, with
a middle path? If so, what is the middle
path and can it be accomplished?

If you have an idea or prejudice or ideal
regarding State as a “rah—rah” college,
write your views in a letter to us. The next
issue of the NEWS will contain some of these
letters. Sign your name to all communica-
tions. Anonymity will be preserved upon
request.

Welcome Sigma Lambda Sigma
The News takes this opportunity to wel-
come Statc college’s fourth fraternity, Sig-
ma Lambda Sigma. The increased quota of
men students in the college makes obvious
the need for more fraternities. Again. wel-

' and you will really get more out of this college.

 

Personal Viewpoints

 

 

 

EGO
This column states my own uncensored ideas, so if
it doesn’t appear you'll know its been censored. As it is
we feel prouder over our one week engagement in this
wider area than We do over our latest “shine” step.
Let’s truck on down.
It It I. t t
A few weeks ago the sophomore class passed a
resolution favoring caps for the freshmen. Although
we didn't agree with this idea We thought it was a
demonstration of the old class spirit and for that cause
applauded it. Just before Christmas recess and the
oblivion of sleep o'ertoox us, we learned some news
that showed that at least two-thirds of the class didn’t
have a tinker's damn worth of class spirit. The fe-
males of this class hid their class banner so conspicu-
ously that it was uncovered the first night. Such a
sophmoronic spirit made us feel Just great and we
realized that if all classes cooperated with the weaker
element in the class of ’40, we'd be hiring the college
‘vic' for From and hold the Hop in the Activities office.
That, of course, was the climax, but there is an
anti-climax. This week, when the frosh hid their
banner, the first night the girls hunted droves of
the second year Midas mongers turned out—in fact
five-tenths of one per cent of the members or one
person showed up. This seems to be leaving the soph
class behind the oval numbered after seven.

We can’t say enough about such laxity. If you
want rivalry, you have to get in and contest with spirit.
If you have no interest in your class, the best thing
for you to do is to flunk out three weeks from today

If you makeup mixers are too interested in that
latest wallet opener of yours, we wish you’d head for
some vacant desert island and Robinson Crusoe it with
him and not clutter up our halls with dead wood.
We’d rather have Charlies McCarthy than such in-
animate feminine non-personalities as yourselves.

l. ‘ Ill It It

We'd also like to be constructive about activities
around State. The state of affairs shows Prom in
February and Soiree in April—in between is a nice lit-
tle void. We'd like to suggest that the freshmen show
their supremacy over their rivals and start a new SO<
cial set-to, something such as a tea dance or an in-
formal swingeroo. Such a thing would have the
support of the college and would give the greenies a
chance to show their newly acquired dancing ability.
Please think it over seriously, youngsters.

 

Christmas vacation found Dr. Mil-
ton G. Nelson, dean of the college
and Mrs. Nelson bound for the South
and Florida. The first stop on the
southward trek was St. Petersburg
Florida, and from there through the
Everglades park to Miami wherc
they spent an entire day "taking in
the beauty of the southern metro-

polls.

On Wednesday, December 22, the
Nelsons took a plane for Nassau in
the Bahamas. The huge forty pas—
senger tri-motor plane was the first
in which the Dean had flown. At
an altitude of 500 feet the floor of
the ocean was visible and the
shadow of the plane frightened
schools of flying fish and sea turtles.

They arrived in Nassau on a June—
like day. in fact, the island is called
"isle of June." At the time We Were
freezing in Albany, the Nelsons were
basking in the warm sun of the
islands but at night, oddly enough, it
was necessary to wear a winter coat.

Nassau. a city of friendly and
considerate people, is a great tourist
center. A letter of introuuction to
an English merchant, held by the
Dean, demonstrated the hospitality
offered by this city. The entire
police force consists of negroes WllO
preserve law and order in the huge
negro population. However. the gov-
ernment and high officials in the
city departments are white and are
contiollcd by the English govern-
ment.

The stores of the city have one
price and permit no bargaining. Yet,
around the corner are the native
markets where the white people bar-
gain with the natives. After bar-
gaining for a little while, Mrs. Nel-
son paid 25 cents for an item which
was marked $1.

Dean Nelson took a great many
candid camera pictures of the na-
tives. Sometimes the natives caught
the Dean in the act and demanded
money of him—but they never got it.
Some of his pictures show the effects
of the hurricanes which damaged
the white section of the city but left
the native quarters practically un-
touched.

There were two things from which
the Nelsons derived much enjoy-
ment. The first was soursop lcc

America’s Deserts "
l
l

Westward, High, Low and Dry, by Dorothy and
Nils Hogner. E. P. Dutton and Company, New York,
1938.
America’s deserts have a kind of fascination for
us in this age of automobiles and we all promise our-
selves to see them and carvo our initials on the cactus
plants.
How to get there? The Hogners tell us it is very
simple. If you are East, however. the Dust Bowl is on
your way. You‘ve read about it of course, and seen it
in the nch reels, but you’ll never quite appreciate
what that vast expanse of dry.drlfting land means to v
the human beings who were trapped there in recent
days until you’ve actually driven through it yourself.
But when you get to God's deserts, the Hogncrs tell
us, many a pleasant surprise awaits you. For romance
is there and mystery. Somehow, the Hogncrs lead us
to believe, evon the mosquitos, slnglng about your ears,
lend a certain magic to a night along the Rio Grande
where you can sleep like a log under a New Mexican
sky “even after three or four cups of coffee."
However, there's no doubt at all about the Dust Bowl.
It's there all right; you taste it even when you shut
your eyes to the vast, empty, scmlvdcscrt that is man's.
You who protest against the millions poured into "farm '
relief” you wouldn’t feel quite so worked up about it,
We think, if you saw what the Hogncrs saw: that the
only thing which remains green at all in that vast,
desolate country Is the hardy. hopeful, rotund plant,
the Russian thlstlcl

 

 

"The tun—baked soil was held down only by Russian
thistlcs and the meager bits of dry plains grass, gram-
me. and buffalo, burnt tan, the color of wheat at hur-
vcst. We sensed that We were in the real 'dust bowl,’
and We could see that. if a big wind storm should come,
the top soil would easily lift up and blow far away . . ."

But the humans stayed on, clinging to the remains
of their "farms," waiting for rain, hoping against hope,
and trusting to God. and to the research of the De-
partment of Agriculture, for a better, brighter future.

Statesman

 

 

 

Happy New Year! The Statesman
.Ias resloved to hear no evil, see no
MI and speak no evil. We think
hot this is a noble resolution and
.vill do our best to keep it.

According to our observations, the
1937 Christmas parties were gener-
Illy dull and boring. The boys all
)ehaved themselves even at the stag
)artles.

During the vacation Ray crossed
;he Hudson to Tarrytown and acted
.IS a pinch-hitter for Charley. We
.hink that was swaet of him.

Al's center of activities for the
holidays was Penn Yan and a good
time was had by all.

Who was the State college students
who stayed in town during vacation
and slept in the bed usually occupied
by a very prominent State under-
grad?

W. A. A. is holding a Bath Party
this week. Maybe that's the only
way they can get some of the folks
near a bath. There's plenty of room
for improvement anyway.

Speaking of baths . . . Ginny, don't
you know that 4:30 a. in. New Year's
morning is no time for anyone to be
in a bath tub. Or was it because
you always take a bath when you
get up?

The return after vacation brought
a new addition to the KDR picture
gallery. Joe says it’s his sister but
we hear that he's been staying home
evenings due to a cold.

Don't they celebrate New Year's
up north, Gaff, or did you come back
early just because you liked the
town?

Dooley was another early arrival
in town but We couldn't find out
whether this had any connection
with a friend of his whose identity
is a deep dark secret.

Little JOe flom across the river
was a regular caller at the Dorm
before vacation and is expected to
continue to be on hand regularly.
When asked for details all Marlon
would say was, “He's tops.”

Exams are looming on the horizon

and with exams comes that curse
of curses, rushing. The Greeks are
rehearsing their personality smiles
and cute ('9) remarks so they’ll be
able to rush the poor freshmen off
,their feet. Some have started in
earnest already by taking possession
of all unwary frosh who dare to
enter the Commons, but the real fun
Is yet to come.

In invading the 'sanctum Sanc-
torum" of the Connecticut State

ment of the winter sports program,chacher‘s college tomorrow night,

the Men's Athletic Association made
arrangements with several local
sports establishments to have the
use of the grounds for the various
sports.

Bowling

M. A. A. has secured the services.
of Rice Bowling alleys for Monday,
Wednesday, and Friday afternoons
at the reduced fee of fifteen cents
per game. Because of the shortage
of funds at the disposal of M. A, A.
the players will have to pay for their
own games.

Sheets have been posted on the
M. A. A. bulletin board for those in-
tercsted in bowling. If" the men
show enough interest in this sport,
arrangements will be made to secure
bowling alloys at a lower rate.

There will be a meeting of those
men interested in bowling to discuss
future plans of the sport. It is hoped
that enough interest will be aroused
to form teams for a league among
the State men.

Swimming

In spite of financial handicaps.
it has been arranged to have swim-
ming in the afternoon and evenings.
Intramural council has obtained the;
use of the Public Baths on Central.
Avenue and Ontario. I

The men have the use of the pool;
every Monday, Wednesday. and Sun- '
day afternoons from 2:00 o‘clock}
until 7:30 o'clock in the evening. Thel
nominal charge is ten cents. This‘
includes soap and towel. The pool
can be used every night from 8:30
to 10:00. the charge being twenty
cents.

Lists have been posted on the
M. A. A. bulletin board for those
who wish to lake lllll'L in this sport.i
Whether or not there will be com--
petitive contests in swimming is yet
to be seen. It is again emphasized
that it will depend on the interest
and action of the men.

A meeting of“ the swimming en—
thusiasts will be called lo discuss
the problems and aims of this aqua—
tic sport. Any suggestions that will
aid in making llll,‘ swimming pro-
gram more complclc and sullsl‘uclol'y

our undefeated basketball squad will
once again return to its alma mater

they will step off unto the final

Intramural Basketball
Moves Into First Round

 

 

Ten Full Teams to Compete
For Individual Awards

 

 

Intramural basketball, with ten
teams and 135 Inen strong, moved
into the first round of play this
week. The teams, besides up-
holding the name of their respective
groups, will also vie for the indivi-
dual charms or awards that will be
given the winning team by the Men’s
Athletic association at their annual
spring banquet.

First Round Plays

After announcement of the plans.
for Intramural basketball, M. A. A.
immediately organized it so that by
the end of a week, the teams were
formed and playing each other.

That the teams are Well balanced
(though a bit rusty) is evidenced by‘
the low scores the first round plays

Kappa Delta Rho fought it out
with the Troy-Schenectady aggre-
gation to win by a five point margin,
the score being 21-16. Neither team

Ambitious Fans

 

W. A. A. has inaugurated its Win-
ter Sports program with the pur-
chase of new equipment. At present
there are six pairs of skiis with soles
and harnesses, six pairs of snow-
shoes, one eight-foot and two six-
foot toboggans.

Since the season will probably not
be very long, Captain Kay Adams
has made the following requirements
for credit: nine hours of participa-
tion in one sport, which will be call-
ed a "major sport," and four hours
of participation in another sport,
which will be called a “minor.”
Skating will be on Washington
Park lake. If skatlng is to be con-
sidered a major, at least three hours
must be done under the supervision
of Captain Marie Metz. If skating
is to be used as a minor, this re-
quirement is reduced to two hours.

Skiers will meet at school with
Captain Mildred Pangbum on Tues-
day and Thursday at 3:30 o'clock.

Snowshoeing, under the direction
of Captain Kay Adams, will be at
the Dorm field on Saturday morn-
ings at 10:00 o’clock.

Tobogganlng enthusiasts will meet
in the rear of Draper hall with Cap-
tain Frances Rianl at 3:30 o'clock
on Tuesday and 2:30 o’clock on Fri-
day.

Activity in these four sports should

be recorded immediately in the
W. A. A. office on cards provided
for that purpose. All people partici-
pating in the program are advised
to watch the bulletin board for
changes in plans due to weather
conditions.

The culmination of the Winter
Sports schedule will be a Winter
Carnival for the whole student body,
sponsored jointly by M, A. A. and
