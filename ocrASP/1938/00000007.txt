c. r.

The men‘s intramural program
enters the second phase of the in-
door season with John O'Brien, '38,
president, and Patsy Miranda. '38.
manager of M, A. A.. both reissuing
calls for support.

The program. as presented, is the
set up of activities in which the men
of State have indicated their inten-
tion to participate and can only be
carried on by participation. Both
Johnny and Patsy feel that men
should not have to be constantly
urged to take part in such activities
especially because of the fact—that
they have indicated their desire for
them.

The. fate of intramurals hung in
the balance for a long time on the
result of the manner in which men
reinforce their expressed desires by
action. Yet. intramurals have some-
how continued. Although there has
been no official word to the effect.
the flagrant lack of interest will
result in little or no future activities.

Swimming is now being conducted
every Monday, Wednesday. and Stin-
day at 2:00 and 7:80 o‘clock at the
Public Baths at Ontario on Central,

i Having unsuccessfully invaded the
‘courts of its metropolitan rivals. a
determined State college quintet re-
turned to its own sanctum prepared
to present a formidable front to the
visiting Hartwick squad this after-
noon at 4:30, and to carry the Pur-
ple and Gold to victory on the
Vermont court tomorrow night.

Buffalo Teachers fell before the on-
slaught of the State team; but mid-
year exams took its toll from State‘s
twin column. Facing the stiffest
weekend in the current season,
Coach Hatfield found that practice
sessions which have been few and
far between were not exactly en-
couraging. At no one time did the
,men find time to engage in a con-
centrated practice and resulted in
the braking of a winning streak such
as no recent State team has enjoyed.

“Fun Day ” For State Students

 

According to Thelma Miller, '38.
president of W.A.A.. and John
‘O'Brien, '38. president of M.A.A.. the
plans for the forthcoming winter
sports carnival have been completed
and are ready to be announced.

If the proposed carnival turns out
to be as successful as it is hoped,
lthere is a possibility that the carni-
fval will be made an annual event
,with the prospects of enlarging its
lscope to include other district schools
such as Russell Sage and R. P. I. in
its program.

i Date, Time. and Place

_ On February 19, Saturday morn-
iing at 8:45 o'clock (providing cold
(weather sets in) amateur and skill-
»ed winter sports enthusiasts will pile

Draper to carry them to Camp Van

day of fun and frolic.

hot dogs and rolls. coffee, banana,
potato chips. and a ricn, real home
made cake.

All this can be had for the lowly
sum of thirty-five cents. However,
those who wish to bring their own
lunches may do so. Round trip
transportation will be twenty-five
cents, or a total of sixty cents for
the whole day's outing.

Sports Program

After lunch is over, the day's pro-
gram will get under way when every-
one will participatc in whatever
sports he or she prefers. Everyone,
no matter how skillful one may be.
will be taking part in one of the ob-
stacle races planned. There will be
snowshoe and skiing races for the
beginners and experts, the latter be-
ing for the most part cross-country.

Also on the program there are in-
cluded skating races for the men and
women, with mixed as well as all-
men and all-women relay teams.
Adding a little more zest to the car-
nival will be a hockey game with
both teams composed of men and
women. Instead of the regulation
hockey sticl-‘s, the players will use
brooms. Ti‘ is. instead of giving and
receiving i'nrd whacks, the players
will gin- and get “love tops.“

The prizes that will be awarded to
the winners of the various competi-
tivc events will be real surprises.
Come out one and all and try to get
one. Everybody has a chanCc to win.
Miss Isabelle Johnston, instructor in
physical education, and Coach Ei-
iiott Hatfield will act in the capacity
of judges.

All are urged to dress warmly.
Wear at least two pairs of socks —
and it isn‘t such a bad idea to bring
some additional pairs for safety.

Indoor Activities

After the outdoor contests are
over, the former exuberant Winter
Sports will be glad to go into the
lodge, where a warm firc plus the
prospects of many hilarious games
await them.

Under the capable direction of
Marion Kingsley, '40, the Winter
Sport will either watch or take part
in the potato, the gunny-sack, the
two-in-onc. and many other races.

Besides the games, there will be
square and round dancing to the
latest tunes that the amplified "vic"
has at its command. In between the
square and round numbers there will
be social dancing.

Finally when it is all over, the
weary but happyt?) playboy and

.playgiri will trudge to the buses that

will carry them home. Back at
school. after supper. they have the
choice of either going to the dance
in the Commons, or getting a good
night‘s rest. The dancing Will be un-
der the syncopated music of the local
“vic” from 8:30 to 11:30 o'clock for
the nominal fee of ten cents a head.

in the event that Saturday will
turn out to be warm and sultry, the
day ‘s trip to Camp Von Schoonhoven
will be cancelled, and instead there
will be a sports dance in the Com-

dents at State will participate to—

gram will be started. Your help in
doing this is asked by signing up im-
mediately for the indoor recreational
program.

The entire program will be under
the supervision of Miss Isabelle
Johnston, instructor in physical ed-
ucation, and Coach Elliott Hatfield.
The general student chairman is yet
to be announced.

Included in the program will be
volley ball, badminton. basketball,
folk dancing, tumbling, boxing, py-
ramiding, and fencing. With the ex-
ception of the last four, all sports
will consist of teams having men
and women.

With the grand finale in the
Sports night. those who show the
greatest interest in these sports will
be chosen to take part in the show.

The committee for the sports night
will be announced soon. The heads
of committees and their assistants
