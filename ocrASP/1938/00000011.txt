Suggestion to the Administration

_ From January third to April fourteenth
is a period of fourteen and a half weeks or
three and a half months. During this time
there is no rest period of any sort for the
students of State college. The two weeks
of examinations are anything but a vaca-
tion, especially for freshmen women and
sorority girls whose formal rushing falls
the second weekend of examination time.
Then the second semester begins and con-
tinues without any let-up until Easter re-
cess.

' The NEWS, reflecting student opinion,
believes that some change in our present
recess schedule would be advantageous. If
the same plan for an Easter recess remains,
there should be about two days added to a
weekend to enable students to visit their
homes and relax. This “weekend” could
come some time in February, perhaps, and
it could be arranged to have Washington's
or Lincoln's birthday one of the two days
added.

The other plan has to do with the aboli-
tion of a two-week Easter vacation and the
institution of a spring recess. Many State
college students have discovered that our
vacation does not coincide with the spring
vacations of other colleges, and many of
us go home to find that all of our friends
from other schools have already had their
reunions ill our home town and have return-
ed to college.

Also, with the Easter recess coming as
late as it does this year, there is a compara-
tively brief' time before final examinations.
The vacation does not divide the working
time evenly. To remedy these situations
the plan is for a spring recess followed by
a long "weekend" of about four days cover-
ing the Easter holidays.

Neither of the preceding plans neces-
sarily involves an addition to the present
number of vacation days of the second sem-
ester. Both mean only the insertion of va-
catidns into our schedules when we need
them most.

 

 

 

 

 

upon its shoulders the task of doing its bit toward
increasing the fund for residence halls. Property is
already owned by the Alumni association on which to
construct further buildings. The need now is for funds
with which to proceed with the actual construction
work.

State college vitally needs a men‘s dormitory—
especially inasmuch as next September will show a
total enrollment of four hundred men for the first
time in the history of the college. There is also a
growing 'need for a men's and women’s athletic house
and a swimming pool.

'The only way of guaranteeing any or all of these
needs is by the fulfillment of pledges by our alumni-
in whose ranks the present seniors will soon be.

So when you are approached by a drive captain,
do not smirk and pass off the subject too lightly or
quickly. Stop and consider! Since 1918 classes and
individuals have pledged financial aid for something
from which they perhaps will never receive material
benefit. Why shouldn't we?

Discussion on the point system at State college will
again be opened today when the revision committee
submits its report in this morning's assembly. Re-
membering last year’s arguments pro and con we
wonder what is in store for us when Bill Mollenkopf
calls for comments from the student body. Already we
have heard the expected rumblings of discord from
certain organizations and holders of major offices.

The purpose of the point system is to insure a
broad distribution of offices among the student body.

‘ and to restrict any one person from holding more

offices than he is capable of handling well.

The purpose of the revision committee is to see
that the number of points assigned to any one office
is a fair number as based upon the actual work and
the prestige connected with that office.

Students should keep these facts in mind when
they are tempted to bring up any argument during
the course of today's discussion. The revision commit-
tee admits that not every one will be in accord with
its findings. Data was gathered from the present
holder of each office and carefully compiled, but the
student must remember that the findings and final
report of the revision committee can only be accurate
to the extent that the submitted data was accurate.

it s a ll!

We also want to take this opportunity to congratu-
late the Women's Alhletic association and the Men's
Athletic association on the success of last Saturday's
barn dance. A welcome informal dance and a success-
ful innovation! State would do well to have more such
gatherings where students can relax from the steady
grind of studies and really "let loose."

Ina'ian Legends

By Otto liowc
Legends of the Longhollsc by Jesse E. Cornplantel‘.
edited by Dr. Harold W. Thompson, Professor of

English, State College, Albany, N. Y., J. P. Lippln-

cott 00., N. Y., 216 pages.

(On. Sale ill the Co-op)

"Tile white people of America have. of late years,
admired the artistic craft of the Indian of the South-
west . . . Only a small number of white Americans,
however. have remembered the talents inherent in the
remnant of the great eastern confederncy. the Iro-
quois."

Jesse E. Cornplunter, snipe tribe of the Sellecns,
has set down as best he could ill our language, the
myths and legends of lllh‘ people. Corllplunter “has
worked hard in the hope that in this book some of
ills readers may. through the medium of a language
strange to him, find the feeling of what his stories
are like when they are told in the Senaoa tongue.”

One of the legends. related by Cornplanter is the
beginning of the pussy-willow as a sign for spring.
Years ago rabbits had long bushy tails. A peculiar
habit of the rabbit is ills love of green leaves and
buds and his desire or love for running. This partic-
ular rabbit was running ill the snow and during it
to snow harder. The rabbit finally became tired of
running and he looked around to find that the snow
was very deep and he had to rest ill the crotch of 0.
Willow tree. When the rabbit woke up he was sur-
prised to find the snow all melted and the grass was
green. The rabbit was stranded in the tree and as
he was a coward at heart he was afraid to climb down.
Tile rabbit finally lost his balance and fell out of the
tree. As he tell his tail caught in the tree thus form»
ing the first pussy willow which has since been the
first sign of spring.

This legend is typical of the Indian folklore which
has been collected in this one volume by Jesse Corn-
planter.

Trad!t!on,—backed by high of-
ficials—has stated that the
freshman class is too inexper-
ienced and too poorly organized
to conduct social events. How-
ever, this year, the freshman
class with the cooperation of the
other classes is sponsoring an
All State dance. The purpose of
this dance is to buy that ampli—
fying system for the ‘vic‘ com-
mittee. Each class will have a
limited number of tickets for
sale at twenty-five cents each.

The active interest of all class-
es the altruistic purpose of the
dance, the low price, plus an in-
sight !nto the capabilities of the
‘greenies' should be enough in-
centive to produce a real crowd.

The dance will be conducted
on Friday March 18, in the Com-
mons with a good swing band
providing the musical back-
ground,

Before we go further, how-
ever, we wish to correct. your
impression that we have been
sitting in the background wait-
ing for someone to suggest this
action. This has been our first
opportunity to get a dance sanc-
tioned. We would like to thank
you for raising interest in the
question and know that your
continued cooperation is going
to help put the dance over in
a big way,

Your friend,
Stan Smith,
President of class of ‘41

May We say thanks and coop-

oration is guaranteed.
ii t II s

We wonder how the sopho-
mores are coming along with
music for Soiree. We hope they
get a good band but don't wallow
around too long just talking.
If you get a good bargain—snap
it up because you haven't a very
fat chance that you’ll get two
such offers.

ll 4‘ It i1

We always are so terribly en-
grossed in all those handsome
creatures who at noontimes
swarm around the gallery of the
Commons to watch their class-
mates whisk about to the discs.
We are so optimistic that we ex-
pect to see these people down in
the heated arena some noon—
but we've seen these same grim
, faces observing us from the same
, position since our earliest days
at State. So, if you are so
Astaireish that you hate to show
us up, please come down, we
need to emulate a new style of
dancing at this point. If you
urrn't too good but can dance
(at least shuffle your feet)"
thcll you can improve—trying is
really the only way to improve.
l!‘ yell can't dance join anyone
of those newly organized truck-
ing classes and learn the funda-
mentals, Come on down with
us low brows, we'd really like to
know you and we’re not as mor-
ollic as you think us.

STATE COLLEGE NEWS, FEBRUARY 25, I938

Varsity Will Encounter
_l:\’._ P. 1. Tonight at Home

Feds to Attack Trojan Rivals
In Last Game of Season

Falling before the onslaught of a
vastly improved St. Michael’s quin-
tet, 41-34, to run their losing streak
to five straight, the Purple and Gold
cagers will stack up against their
traditional rivals, the R. P. I. engine-
ers, who will invade the Page hall
gym tonight to avenge the defeat
handed them by the Feds ill a game
last December.

St. Michael's Game

Last week, St. Michael's came,
saw and conquered a hard fighting
State five. In the first half the
teams matched basket for basket
with State leading by a one point
margin, and then St. Michael's, At
the crucial moment, when State
needed points badly, Mike Walko
sank them. At the half, State led
by a one point margin,

Ill the second half, a determined
St. Michael's met an equally deter-
mined State team, and during the
first few minutes, both sides played
cautiously. Feeling that they had
solved the problem of State's play-
ing, St. Michael's really went to
town. and pulled ahead of the Pur-
ple and Gold with a six point edge
which they kept throughout the re-
mainder of the game.

Coach Hatfield threw in a new
combination in an effort to stop St.
Michael's, and for a moment it was
effective. However, the latter got
wind of the new combine’s tactics,
and again piled up a commanding
lead.

Possible New Combine

Speculation has been running high
on the question of what combina-
tion the coach will use in tonight's
game. Will he use the same combine
that won nine straight for us. or
will he use a different one?

Last year. State and R. P. I. split
with the Hatfield aggregation win-
ning the second game on the home
court in c. 32-27 upset,

Earlier this year, in enemy terri-
tory, the Feds defeated the Engin-
eers 36-28 to give State the edge in
the rivalry between the two schools.

There are two factors in favor of
the Purple and Gold. One, that the
Troy five has shown litle improve-
ment since the two squads met, and
two, the boys are recovering from
the set-back that the mid-terms
gave them. This is evidenced from
their playing last week as compared
to the Hartwick game when they ap-
peared to be “off-form."

Tonight's Gallic

Ill tonight's contest, the last game
01' the season, State will enter the
court favored to win. The boys will
have to watch out for King Ward,
Chris Fnzlola, and Fellows. the main
stays of the. Trojans.

This game will be the lust for Cap-
tain Tommy Ryan, who graduates
this year. He has played stellar
bull all season, playing ill every
game, fighting to keep the team's
spirit up and constantly scoring
points when needed.

In a preliminary. the Fresh meet
the Donald Yearllllgs in their last
game of the season. Tile frosll are
out for blood. To date they have
well but one game. losing the past
four games by one or two point mar-
gins, In n fighting mood they won't
give quarter to their rivals. They
have caught the fighting spirit. of
George Amyot, their coach. After
the game, there will be dancing ill
the Commons.

 

Attention! Fresh!

 

 

 

Tonight, 111 ll preliminary to the
main game. the Fresh baskelocrs
stack up against tile R. P. I. Fresh
who now. them a licking earlier in
the season, Now, the Fresh. very
much improved since they met the
lslngillccr warnings are out to avenge
that defeat. To help them out with
moral support it is urged that all
Freshmen attend that game and,
with the capable loading of Steve
Knack. cheer them on to victory.

They will be playing the last game
of the season. and want to end the
your with a victory against their
traditional rivals. Come on out and
show your class spirit. Help your
team fight to will!

 

 

The
Pitcher’s
Box

W. D. R.

Will the Purple and Gold basket-
eers wind up their 1937-38 season
with a smashing victory over the
engineers from R. P. 1. tonight?

This final contest will . . . unlike
that of years past...mark the ter-
mination of the intercollegiate bas-
ketball career of but one varsity
man . . .Captain Tommy Ryan .
last year's closing game of the sea-
son dropped the curtain on six var-
sity men's collegiate basketball days
, . . and after the last game on next
year's schedule Duke, Mike, Wheeze,
George. Merrill, and Bill will hang
up their intercollegiate basketball
shoes . . .

Tonight's scrap offers the states-
men their !ast possible hope of again
returning to the win column . . . tra-
dltional rivalry in itself is not too
difficult an obstacle for the Hatfield
crew to overcome . . . but “to break"
the jinx of five consecutive losses

. . after nine consecutive wins . . .
will prove their greatest handicap
. . . and a horse of another color . . .

Regardless of the outcome of our
past five games . . . Coach Hatfield
has given State a satisfactory as
well as a succesful season , . . to-
night's fracas will certainly be pack-
ed with al! of traditional rivalry's
keener points which have marked
our clash with the Trojan engineers
on the Page court in previous
years . . .

Tonight's game will . . . as we have
pointed out . . . wind up intercolleg—
iate ball for Tommy Ryan . . . and
whether Ryan can and will turn in
the best performance of his colleg-
iate basketball days is unknown , . .
but it is a certainty that Captain
Tommy Ryan will not forget for a
moment that this game is ills last
. . . the last time he will wear the
Purple and Gold colors . . . the last
time he will be privileged to give
his best for his alma mater . . . is
it any wonder that no other ball
game in a basketeer's long and
drawn~out career means more to
him than this particular one . . .
which is the last inevitable lllile of
every intercollegiate ball player , . .

Men’s Bowling League
To Roll At Rice Alleys

This afternoon. at four o’clock,
the newly formed intramural
bowling league gets under way
on the Rice Bowling Alleys
located on Western and Quail
when Avalon hall No. 1 meets
Spencer hall No. l in the first
league game.

Because of the difficulty of
getting five men teams, it has
been decided to have four men
teams.

In the first match this after-
noon, your reporter will see the
above mentioned teams who
have fought together in Intra-
mural basketball, now fight it
out separately.

At the same time on the other
alleys, Potter Club will break the
ice with the All-Stars for their
initial win. The All-Stars, just
added to the league, is captained
by Bill Steel, ’38.

Other games scheduled for
this afternoon are: Kappa Delta
Rho vs, College House; Sigma
Lambda Sigma vs. Albany. and
Kappa Beta vs. Troy.

This is the first time that the
Men's Athletic Association has
sponsored bowling. Constantly
being petitioned by the men,
M. A. A. formed a league of six-
teen teams composed of four
men. The manager is Frank
Rickman. For any additional in.
formation. write him.

Senior Team Wins
inter—class Cup

Miller, High Scorer, Leads
Freshmen to Victory
In Rivalry Game

 

The seniors again displayed their
superiority in the interclass league
by defeating the juniors 24-12 on
Saturday. Since each team could
produce only five players, a roving
center was used during the entire
game. Phyllis Jobson and Grace
Yorkey paved the way for the senior
victory by accounting for 10 points
apiece. Junior high scorers were
Betty Allen and Phyllis Arnold, who
each netted 4 points.

In an exciting contest featured by
hard playing, the freshman lassies
squeezed out a 20-19 victory over
the sophomores last Saturday in the
play-off of the rivalry series. Helen
Miller, consistent point-scorer for
the frosh. again led her team with
12 points. By virtue of this victory
the fresh captured the basketball
rivalry title. having won two of the
three games played.

Led by Ethel Little scoring 19
points, the seniors trounced the
frosh last Friday, 33-7, ill a one-
sldcd fray.

Repeating their achievement of
last year, the class of '38 captured
the basketball trophy by winning the
greatest number of games in the in-
tel'class competition which W. A. A,

The elusive cow, when captured, was

Although Winter Carnival was def -

resentative one, as its members will
be chosen from the teams of all the
classes. After the game the Skid-
more team will be the guests of W.
A. A. at a dinner at Wagar's. A
turn-out at the game would be a
nice mark of friendship.

A. A. is certainly doing all it can
to meet other schools in friendly
competition in athletic events-~first
Skidmore, then Oneonta on March
'7, and there are plans afoot to hold
a Triangular Telegraphic meet this
spring. Everything is very, very,
tentative, but such a meet would be
run in this way: at the same time,
on their own campuses, the three
schools would have a tournament in,
perhaps. archery. At the conclu-
sion of each tournament, the schools
would telegraph their results to a
pre-determined center. and the
name and score of the winner of all
three tournaments would be tele-
graphed back.

Campers please note: Camp John-
ston is a grand place to recover
from early — in - the - semester - dol-
drums, and there was much excite-
ment when the last group to go out
took toboggans and skiis with them.

Spring Indoor—germinal

Hershkowitz and Hessnoy
Head All. Arrangements

During the past two weeks, W. A.
A. and M. A. A. have made tenta-
tive announcements concerning the
Spring Indoor Sports Carnival which
will take place on March 26th. Now,
they are ready to go into action with
a concrete program.

With Duke Hershkowitz, ’39, chair-
man, and Louise Hessney, ’40, assist:
ant chairman, it is planned that.
between now and the indoor sports
carnival, each man and woman at
State will be given a comprehensive
recreational sports program in every.
field.

Badminton -

It is hoped that Al. Sloman, ath-
letic director of the Albany Y. M.
H. A. and Whitbeck R. Cusick. city
champion will give an exhibition in
Badminton, a sport that has invaded
this country several seasons back
and has risen in popularity on a
par with other indoor sports.
winners of the Badminton tourna-
ment, which will soon take place.
will play in a preliminary exhibi-
tion.

There will also be tournaments
in the other fields of sport to deter-
mine who will take part in the in-
door carnival. In addition, the winr
ners and runners up in the foul
shooting and “21" contests will play
the finals then. It is possible that
the winner and runner up of the
Intramural basketball will give an
exhibition. This will be decided
later on. This will take the place of
the mixed and the interclass rivalry.
The latter will be played later on in
the season.

Square Dancing Exhibition

It is planned to have an exhibition
of folk dancing where the men and
women will do some of the more
complicated square and round
dances to show what our ancestors
in the not so distant past did in
their spare time, It should be not
only amusing but educational as
well to see what our modern farmers
and farmerettes can do.

The boxing program is under Paul
Schmitz, '38, who we remember did
a fine job with the boxing team in
last year’s carnival.

The students who have been ap-
pointed captains and assistant cap-
tains are: Volley ball, Louise Hes—
sney, '40, and Earle Cleaves; Bad-
minton, Marlon Rockefeller, ’39, and
Bill Thomas, ’40: Basketball, Ed.
Melanson, '39, and Betty Allen, ’39;
Folk Dancing. June Palmer, ’39, and
