STATE COLLEGE FOR TEACHERS, ALBANY, N. Y., lVlARCII 4, 1938

Morning Assembly to Hear

State Debaters to Meet

iron:

Friedlander and Lovalenti‘

Will Uphold Negative
Issue of N. L. R. B.

HARD SCHEDULE AHEAD

Debate Council Plans Radio
Broadcasts Over Local
Networks Soon

Tonight at 8:15 o'clock in the
Lounge of Richardson hall, State
will meet the star debate team of
Dayton university, which is on the
Eastern tour, according to William
Bradt, '38, president of Debate coun-
cil. The Dayton team debated pre-
viously at Niagara university and
Syracuse university and it has on
its calendar debates with New York
university, Villanova college and
Penn State college.

The men who will represent the
Dayton team are: Daniel Hobbs,
winner of the President's plaque for
debating in 1936 and winner of Dr.
D. C. Reilly oratoricai contest in
1936 and 1937 and George L. Wolf,
manager of Debate in 1937 and 1938,
has three years of university debat-
ing experience in back of him.

Leonard Friedlander and Thomas
Lovalenti, juniors, will uphold the
negative on the question: The na-
tional labor relations board. The
debate will be conducted on the Ore-
gon style which permits cross-ques-
tioning of the opposite teams.

The debate teams had an active
season last semester and an even
more strenuous schedule is planned
this semester. All the debates have
been either panel discussions or non-
decision debates. Facts count more
in these debates than Showmanship.
The debate teams have a combina-
tion of both, with the result that
they are experiencing a successful
season.

The debates are concerned with the
coming Constitutional convention.
The debates conducted in this city
before the Rotary club and Women's
club, featured the probable issues
that might come up at the conven-
tion. The debates at the colleges
outside the state concerned them-
selves with a discussion of Unicam-
crallsm.

Under the guidance of Mr. Williaml

Hardy, instructor in English, the de-
bate squad has become a prominent
institution at State. Governor Her-
bert H. Lehman sent a letter to Mr.
Hardy, commending the way our
teams have conducted themselves at
the various debates throughout the
city. Mr. Hardy also has a debate
seminar for all members of the var-
sity.

State college will begin a new in-
novation next month, in that it in-
tends to broadcast its debates over
the local stations.

Is Board Member of Magazine

by Charles Kelley 0’“

If you are young enough, and are
riding the New York Central this
month, you will be presented the
current. issue of “Story Parade," 0.
popular story magazine for children.
The person largely responsible for
this gift is Miss Helen Fay, a former
mcmbcr of the faculty of State
college, and former manager of the
college Co-Op.

In this issue of “Story Parade,”
the interesting tale of “Curly Top" is
told. Violet Schmidt, of Elkhart,
lndlana, was a young girl of five
when she and her family were forced
to live near the New York Central
Railroad tracks over which the
"Twentieth Century" sped each day.
The swiftly moving train fascinated
Violet, and each day, she would
faithfully come to the same spot and
watch it go by. One day a man in
one of the cars waved, and the small
girl timidly waved back. Thereafter,
this became a regular event in her
day which could not be omitted for

anything; not even games and par-
ties. Soon the porters, conductors,
and the whole crew of the train
became accustomed to seeing the
cheery smile and greeting of “Curly
Top" as the men called her. After
three years, the trainmen gave her
the title "Curly Top, the Sweetheart
of the Twentieth Century," The presi-
dent. of the railroad heard about
her, and had Curly Top and her
mother as special guests on the fam-
ous train. Later the young girl was
taken to New York City to celebrate
the birthday of the "Twentieth Cen-
tury."

This incident. has been written up
as a narrative tale for children in
the current issue of "Story Parade."
Miss Fay, field representative on the
editorial board of the magazine,
realizing the interest and enjoyment
this story would have for young pas-
sengers on the trains, convinced the
railroad officials that they should
buy 1500 copies of the magazine, and
distribute them to their soul] guests.

by Saul Grecnwaid

Interest in the coming constitu-
tional convention to take place in
the New York State assembly cham-
bers, April 5, is evidenced by the
numerous newspaper articles and
debates in the high schools and
colleges throughout the state. There
will be 168 delegates; three from
each senatorial district and fifteen
delegates at large. The Republicans
exceed with 91 delegates, the Demo-
crats with 76, and one Fusionist from
New York city,

The people of New York are gov-
erned under the 1895 constitution at
the present time. At the 1915 con-
vention, there was an attempt to re-
vise the constitution but the people
didn't accept the revision. However,
the constitution has been changed
through amendments which have
been voted upon in the regular elec-
Lions.

According to Dr. Rienow, instruc-
tor in government, the main issues
at the convention will be: (1) Gas
Taxes-~An attempt by the conven-
tion to modify the constitution so
that the gas taxes will be used for
highway purposes alone and not dis-
tributed to any other departments
of the government as it now is done;
(2) Civil Service--An attempt to
strengthen the now existing civil
service laws in the state and make
them more enforcable; (3) Reap-
portionment will cause the greatest
dispute at the convention because
New York city wants representatives
in proportion to its population while
the up-staters want weighted repre-
sentation: (4) The convention will
take up the reorganization of state
departments, eliminating some of
them and consolidation of others
in order to get rid of the waste in
inefficient government.

 

For the college assembly, the state

State Constitutional Convention

To Meet in Albany Next April

A

 

is organized into assembly districts
which have an assembly leader and
publicity director who contact the
local civic organizations.

Letters from Herbert. H. Lehman
and Charles Poletti were received,
praising the work of State college
students for their work and also for
their interest in civic government.

Associate commissioner of Educa-
tion, George Wiley, became interest-
ed in the work here. He sent out
messages to the high schools of the
state encouraging the teachers and
students to take active interest in
the comingr convention and sug-
gested high school debates as the
means of discussing the issues. The
New York State Education maga-
zine has allowed a page to Dr.
Rienow to discuss the work of State
college students.

At the convention, the public will
be allowed to voice its opinion on
the floor of the assembly. At the
present time, the committee here
wishes to send a speaker to voice
Eiﬂic college‘s opinion in the assem-
1y.
Dr. Rienow recently stated in ref-
cl'ciicc to the work of the high
schools, “At the discussion groups,
local experts and business men are
called In to giVe testimony and are
crosswquestioned by the students.
After the school has reached a decis-
ion, it secures the endorsements of
various civic organizations in its
locality, The main object is to
direct public opinion to the issues
confronting the people."

This work gives the students act—
ual practice in the formation of gov—
ernmentai law and some idea of the
function and work of their govern-
ment. The students are becoming
citizens of their community and will
become effective citizens when they
are able to vote.
