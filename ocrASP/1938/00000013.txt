College Constitutional Assembly

Next month will see the start of the New
York State Constitutional Convention and
the climax of the State College Constitu-
tional assembly.

Last November, under the quick and
efficient leadership of Dr. Robert Rienow,
instructor in government, interested stu-
dents of the college organized an assembly
whose purpose was to acquaint State col-
lege students with the practical aspects of
politics today. Student officers were elect-
ed and soon the assembly was conducting
its meetings regularly. The entire student
body was divided into groups, each group
comprising all the people from each of the
senatorial districts of New York state.
These groups chose their leaders who are
working as the connecting links between
the college and the constitutional delegates
and civic organizations in their home town
districts.

During assembly meetings, resolutions
are introduced on some measure pertinent
to the time. If these resolutions are con—
sidered worthy of further investigation they
are assigned to committees for study. The
committee members, chosen l'rom the (fon-
stitutional assembly cnthuxiasts, study the
problem and offer its findings to the gen—
eral assembly in the form oi' a report. Then
follows discussion oi" the report and a vote
to determine the assombly's stand on the
matter.

The i'ile oi' these votes indicates the at-
titude which members of the college assem-
bly will take when they attend the open
meetings oi' the state convention. May suc-
cess be theirs next month.

Between the Acts

{Ill ()l/ji'l'lii't' (ml [or l.tl(ll(‘.\ oml (It'll/Irma!

During the time between acts oi' invited
artists or between drumutics plays while
students are playing musical instruments,
one should (1) whistle to see if one can
outdo the musicians (2) stretch with a loud
yawn and sleep (3) see how far one can
loan from the balcony without falling (4)
make airplanes and other devices and call
them over into the audience (5) appreciate
the between-act entertainment quietly.
Number 5 is the correct answer. Would you
believe it?

 

 

Civic Responsibilities

 

 

 

 

COMMENTSTATER

Now that the worries, dreads, horrors, headaches f

and panics brought on by last semester’s examinations
are the furthest thought from our minds, We are able
to turn our attention and efforts to activities less aca-
demic in nature. This means that we now can give
a little more thought to the social and civic aspects
of our existence at State.

However, the social aspect is beyond our consid-
eration here. It’s the civic that We want to hit out at
—and that's the current lack of clvic-mlndedness so
excessively evident among the enthusiastic “stoogents”
of this institution. By this We mean the absence of
a general interest in the campus problems of State,
evidenced by a sort of I-don’t~care or What's-lt-all-
about attitude displayed by the average student citizen.
A reason for this is probably that each is so very, very
busily concerned with his own petty social and aca-
demic problems, so wrapped up in his own self-con-
tained world, that he does not even bother to stop
and consider what’s what in his campus life. We
don't want you to get the impression that this applies
to everyone. Yes, we are happy to say there are a
few who are alert enough to be interested in civic
matters.

But before we go any further, we ought to cite an
example of what we're driving at. A question which
should have caused much thought and discussion was
that of the recent action of the sophomore class in
petitioning Myskanla for the re-establishment of the
wearing of freshman caps, a question which is vital to
every member of the student body. But did it cause
any semblance of a furor? Very, very little. All we
could notice was a few letters sent to the editor of
this publication and a mention of it here and there.

But what does this all lead to, you ask. It means

simply that we as prospective teachers are failures as 1

citizens of State college. Please pardon us if we get a
bit Sunday-schoolish, but we do want to drive this
thought home—that if We are to strive to become

reasonably good teachers, we must strive to become '

reasonaﬂy good citizens here at State. As teachers,
we will be expected to instill within our pupils the
ideals, or at least a concept of citizenship. But how

can we expect to do this in later life if We cannot now '

learn to do so in our collegiate days?

Therefore We make this plea.‘ Let’s strive to be-
come better citizens. Let’s attend more class meetings
and participate in them. Let's give more attention
and consideration to assembly business meetings. Let’s
discuss and think more among ourselves about campus
problems. And lastly, let’s express our serious opinions
and make ourselves heard through the medium of the
student publications, the News, the Lion, and the
Echo. In other words, let's become efficient youthful
citizens now, so that in later life we'll become efficient
adult Citizens,

Boo/e of Med/la;
Forgotten Battles

“Action at Aquila," by Hervey Allen. Farrar and Rlne—
hart, N. Y., 369 pages.
(On Salc in lllc 00-01))

In a few brief moments, the thoughts of the varied
and colorful events of his month's leave of absence
crowd the reality of the ever—present Civil War from
the mind of Colonel Nat Franklin, stationed with his
men at Aquila, in the heart of the Shenandoah Valley.

As he arouses himself from his reverie, he begins
to examine minutely the valley which lies before him.
No sign of life, yet Colonel Franklin is not satisfied;
exploring, he finds traces of a Confederate family in
which he is interested, and for whom he has been
looking.

Taking them under his protection, he becomes vory
fond of them, and finally, after the battle of Aquila
in which two of their loved ones are killed, marries
the widow. The battle of Aquila was such that of it
was sold, “It was hardly Well known enough even to be
forgotten—~lt was scarcely remembered at all. It was
all ovor 1n n h-W moments, all but the grief and suffer-
ing."

As he hears his death, during the time of the
Spanish—American wur, his own experience and keen
perception make him realize that when a nation says:
“Now We are engaged in a great war to . . , " the “now”
has no end to it. It renews itself for ouch man, and
so for all men in the ever-lasting present. It is an
eternal now that belongs to the ages. It means forchr.

This is a completely different type from his
“Anthony Adverse," yet it shows his mastery of power-
fully moving descrlptlvo and conversational style. This
book presents both sides of a minute portion of the
War, and brings clearer understanding of the horrors
of any war, with realization of the terrible damages
of just a few active moments, taken from years of a
single needless war.

Personal

Viewpoints

We're sick of being trampled
on in the activities office by the
rush of those students who have
no business at all there. Daily,
we look over the hordes in the
den and find the biggest major-
ity have no offices at all and
therefore no reason for being
there. We wish you'd take your
neWSpapers, magazines, History
III projects that litter up this
supposed working place and re-
move them along with your per-
sons.

At the beginning of the year
we thought that the rule of lock-
ed doors was golng to be kept
and that the undesirables were
to be kept out. We recommend
to the heads of the activities of-
fice in the bee hive that they go
back to this and enforce it. It
might cause a little more effort
to some of us for we would have
to bring our keys but at least
there would be a chance to work
when We wanted to.

To those students who fre-
quent the place and have no
business there—please get out
and stay out unless you have
business to transact—concerning
an activity, that is.

An All State dance looms in
the distance. It has, as you
know. an admirable purpose,
that is to purchase an amplify-

day dancing. We expect all the

men and push this dance. The
price is low, the dance promises
possibilities of great fun and
we're expecting it to be a great
success. Get your tickets early
as they'll go faster than snow-

Nine Women Make Up Team
For First Encounter
ln Varsity Swim

Tomorrow W. A. A.‘s recently
chosen swimming team will travel to
Oneonta to meet the Oneonta Nor-
mal school swimming team in a
practice meet,

Early in the winter season Miss
Effie Swire, captain of the swimming
at Oneonta, presented a tentative
plan for the meet which was slightly
revised by A. As swimming captains
and then accepted by swimming of-
ficials of both schools. As the pro-
gram now stands, the meet will con-
sist of an eighty-yard relay; a
twenty-yard free-style race; a twen-
ty-yard breast-stroke race; a twen-
ty-yard back-stroke race; several
stunt races, including a balloon race,
an umbrella race, a newspaper race,
and a spoon-and-pcanut race; and
several dives, including the straight-
front dive, the running-front dive,
and the jack-knife dive.

The team has spent this week in
strenuous last—minute practice. striv-
ing to improve their speed a .1 their

form in diving. The members of the , ,

team are Muriel Barry, Ruth Lewis,
juniors; Janet Montfort, Florence
Przyborowska, Jane Wilson, sopho-
mores; Iris Barnett, Louisa Chap-
mnn. Marlon Keables and Dorothy
North, freshmen.

The swimming captains have plan-
ned to have Barnett and North enter
the free-style; Chapman and Przy-
borowska, the breast-stroke; Barry
and Keables, the back-stroke; Lewis,
Montfort and Wilson, the dives.

, Classes Will Resume
lnlerclass Rivalry

Interclass rivalry will be resumed
next Friday night when the sopho-
mores and freshmen will match
forces in the annual soph-frosh
basketball tilt.

Under the coaching of Mike Walko
and George Amyot, juniors, the
F‘rosh have been working out every
afternoon in preparation for the
contest. Although they haven’t been
so successful in their basketball en-
gagements this season, the Fresh are
determined to make this tilt with
the Sophs “a horse of another color."

sity basketball Lenin, ls coaching the
Sophs. The soplls will draw Walt

Bleecker Club Squad

Includes State Men

The strong Albany Bleecker Club's
basketball squad boasts eight states-
men on its roster, despite the fact
that but tWo are “full-blooded”
statesmen—Captaln Paul Schmitz
and Pete Rodenrys, seniors.

Ray Marling and Johnny Bedford
boasts three years experience at Tor-
onto as does Max Griffin at Mariet-
ta, and Mike Gaddls at Colgate.
Johnny Havko, ’40, came to State
with a two-year record at Mount St.
Mary's, while Arnold Ellerin is
“fresh” from high school.

To date the Bleecker boys have
played 12 games: losing the first,
winning the next 10, and dropping
their twelfth contest last Monday
night to the strong Albany Y. M.

(sounds a little gory, doesn't it?) A
knowledge of the history of fencing
is a knowledge of history from the
sixteenth century to the present day.
Maybe that's why there are more
than fifty people out for fencing
during this mldseason. Or maybe
not!

Herb Frankel, '39, fencing instruc-
tor, is slightly overwhelmed at the
size of the class, but is bearing up
bravely. He does not approve of
following the European method of
instruction. This method does not
permit the student to hold a weapon
or do anything but practice positions
for six months, then lets him have
a foil and make passes at thin air
for two years before engaging in any
actual combat. Instead, Frankel has
already had the class practice posi-
tions—the advance and the retreat-
and hold a fell at the same time!
As soon as the mastery of these posi-
tions is fairly well under way, the
members of the class will proceed to
actual combat. As soon as Frankel
has progress, the more proficient of
the class will display their newly-
acqulrcd talents in some dueling on
Sport Night.

Fencing is a guaranteed cure for
anything i'rom falling arches to fall-

Stale Defeats
R. P. l. Engineers
To End Campaign.

State Wins Total of Ten
Games, Loses Five;
Simmons Stars

The State college team offset its
five defeats, two to one, last Friday
night when it completely annihilated
an invading R. P. I. quintet 57-23,
before an overflowing crowd of rabid
fans on the Page hall court.

Off to an early lead in the first
period, the Engineers displayed ex-
cellent passing ability with Shako as
the mainstay in their offensive drive.
With Simmons playing brilliant
“follow- up" ball, the defenders
wormed the lead away from their
opponents who trailed 22-18 at the
first half whistle.

The second half was a walkaway
for the Hatfield hoopsters, who,
taking advantage of the hard-won
lead, sallied again and again into
the enemy territory to score. Cap-
tain Tom Ryan, playing his last in-
tercolleglate game, exemplified a
stellar brand of ball-handling
throughout the contest while garner-
ing 14 points. Ryan's outstanding
performance was hailed with a tre-
mendous applause as he left the

0am” Lehman did his best with
twelve; however neither could out-
polnt Simmons who had a field day
all his own, netting an aggregate of
16 points.

The superb passing of Larry Balog,
fleety forward, accounted for a good
many of the State tallies. More than
once did the fast little forward slip
thru the enemy passing attack.

The sudden let-down of the
visitors in the final period of the
game seemed to be the result of
Shako's absence on the floor when
the last half got underway. As he
had sustained three personal fouls
during the first half of the encoun-
ter, Shako warmed the bench during
the opening minutes. When finally
sent back into the lineup, Shako
found that the damage had been
done. The final gong rang the knell
over the burial place of the R. P. I.
attempt to defeat the teachers.

ten an ideal flnls to an ideal cam-
palgn.
