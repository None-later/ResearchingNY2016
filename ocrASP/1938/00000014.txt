Former State Student

Is Now Radio Luminary

Listen in on your radio every
day at 12:05 o’clock to Spauld-
ings Quick Quiz over WOKO
and you will hear the voice of
one of State’s outstanding grad-
uates. Listen to Steefel’s Sport-
cast broadcast twice Weekly over
the same station and you will
hear the same person, Grenfell
N. Rand, ’34.

A former president of student
association, Rand now holds the
position of production supervisor
of WOKO. Teaching for a year
after graduation, at the Albany
Collegiate center. he participated
in the recently conducted
Regent’s Inquiry, but soon left to
assist his late father in radio
work. Upon the latter’s death,
he replaced his father on the
staff of WOKO.

Rand, along with his other
duties, is now heard on five dif-
ferent programs over local sta-
tions. Already a favorite of radio
listeners, “Grenie” is rapidly
gaining a name for himself in
radio work.
