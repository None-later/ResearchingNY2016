Saturday, March 20, a big day in

Day, and of the second annual Sport
Night sponsored Jointly by W. A. A.
and M. A. A.

The women’s events begin at 10:00
o'clock Saturday morning when the
alumnae guests who return for the
day will “retreat from civilization"
to have lunch and perhaps a short
hike at Camp Johnston. Kay Con-
klin, '38, chairman of the lunch has
promised to provide a good outdoor
meal. A few women of the college
will Journey to Chutham with the
guests to help entertain them.

In the afternoon, from 2:00 to 5:00
o'clock, a program of informal rec-
reation has been scheduled. As
planned, this program will consist
of basketball, badminton, volleyball,
fencing, ping-pong, paddle tennis
and a foul—shooting contest. This
period is not limited to alumnae only,
for all women of the college are in-
vited and urged to participate.
Competitive teams of undergraduates
will be matched against the alumnae.

Dorothy MucLeun, '39, general
chairman of W. A. A.'s twenty-sixth
annual Winter Banquet, has set the
lime of that event for 5:00 o'clock,
and the price at. fifty cents. Two
features of the dinner will be a
speech by Belly Morrow, last year's
president, and a skip—the wedding
of Nellie Tennis and Archie Archery.
The theme of the decorations will be
blue and while, the senior class
colors. The food committee, Bernice
Mosbcy, '39, chairman, and Mildred
King, '39, has arranged for u rulbcr
unusqu meal. The other banquet.

pointed, so there absolutely has to
be one! More comforts and conven-
iences for camp-mattress covers, a
kitchen cabinet, AND LOCKS. May-
be next Lime the thieves won’t be
so petty—they'll probably get big
ideas and carry the whole camp
away bodily.

Take heart, fencers~you won't
have to wait. your turn for mask and
foil any longer—six new articles of
each vurlcly are being purchased.
Cheer up. badminton enthusiasts——
you can start, playing double prac—
llcully now—because you're going to
get six new racquets,

Previews of spring season—golf
instructions from Jerry Dwyer of the
Municipal Golf Course—golfing at
the course for fifty cents on week-
days and seventy-five on Saturdays
and Sundays—bowling at the Rice
Alleys, with refunds for credit, com-
1)lclci's——a return meet with On-
conlu’s swimming team and lots of
pracllcc so we'll come out on top——
maybe another play-day at Skid-
more, or an archery tournament with
Russell Sage—the future looks pretty
bright, doesn't It? We're “happy
about the whole thing."

The balmy weather should encour-
age less venllu'csomc riders to trek
out to Alnsbach’s for canters through
the backwoods. But actually it was
much more thrilling when the paths
were icy and slippery!

Could we urge the Lotta Bunkers
captain to project; a hike along the
Normansle Creek, sometime soon?
Recouuncndullon: signposts about
cvcry two feet so that; the hikers
don‘t; luch to bother busy farmers
by asking directions,

Advice lo all tennis players: Pray
for weather as unlike that of last; fall
as possible, or you’ll be left, with
about five games to finish when the
scuson ends.
