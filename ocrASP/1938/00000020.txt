bers, the crowds will be diverted to
the Commons, which will be com-
pletely renovated for the dancing.

Governor Herbert H. Lehman will
address this morning’s assembly,
according to the announcement
made by Warren 1. Densmore, ’38,
president of the student association
and member of Myskania.

In consenting to address this
morning’s assembly Governor Leh-
man was forced to leave innumerable
bills, including several pertaining to
education, that are awaiting his
signature.

Since his visit to State college
several years ago Lehman has main-
tained an active interest in the col-
lege. Shortly after the Constitu-
tional Assembly was formed last fall,
Govornor Lehman sent a letter to
Speaker Leonard Friedlander con-
gratulating him with the hope that
the good work would continue until-
the new constitution is put before
the general public this fall.

Governor Lehman came into na-
tional prominence in 1928 when he
was elected lieutenant governor of
New York state by a plurality vote
of 14,000. Since that time the public
