For Aspiring Stagehands

Last Friday in assembly, an accident
occurred which might very well have been
both serious and painful. It seems that
some innocent bystander tampered with
the lights in such a way that not only was
the lighting throughout the performance
obscured but a piece of the apparatus fell
and hit a member of the audience.

Ou'r complaints regarding the matter
are twofold. In the first place, it was pure
luck that the screening fell in such a way
that the student was not seriously hurt. In
the second place, we feel that the people
who are members of the stagecraft class are
expert enough to be able to arrange the
equipment unaided.

We do not wish to dampen the enthu-
siasm of the aspiring stagehand, but we do
suggest that if he is sufficiently interested
in the drama, he register in the English 13
course, thereby protecting not only valu-
able stage equipment, but the welfare of
the assembly.

A University of New Yorhi3

We note with interest that our own Con-
stitution assembly has gone on record as
favoring the establishing of a tuition-free
university for New York State. A realiza-
tion of this educational dream would be
ideal, we admit, and yet we are forced to
consider the possible results with apprehen-
sion.

Dr. Robert Hutchinson, president of
Chicago university, says that “to deprivc
anyone who has an aptitude and a desire
for more education because his parents can
not afford to give him one is to commit an
offense not only against the individual, but
against society." We agree with the senti-
ment but is the state university the answer
to this problem? The tremendous cost of
maintaining a university would necessarily
limit the number of people who could be
admitted. Sincc scholastic averages are
usually used as a basis for entrance, we
should concludc that the registration would
include the most intelligent students and
not the most nocdy, it is the same principle
upon which our state scholarships are
based, and w: bclicvo that it is a faulty
promise.

Administrative problems would certainly
result, including obtaining a sufficiently
large appropriation, and the centralization
of those schonls already maintained in
whole or in part, by the state.

We review the proposal with doubts and
questions, and yet We cannot help but admit
that we favor the plan, and would be among
the first to further its realization.

 

 

 

Safety Suggestions

 

 

 

COMMENTSTATER

As the days grow warmer, the problem of promot-
ing a safety campaign at State college grows more
and more urgent. Many cities have instituted safety
campaigns in the spring and we feel that one nearer
home would be more interesting to the student body.
Your Commentstater, wandering about the campus
found several conditions that need to be rectified.

t it t It I

The first thing that attracted his attention was
the railing on the Commons balcony. When he at-
tempted to lean against the railing at noon time, it
sagged under his weight. Suppose that ten or fif-
teen fellows should lean against this weak railing
which is held in place by a few weak bolts attached
to the wall and floor. Can you imagine the bruises
or perhaps broken bones that might result from a
fall from the six foot balcony? Almost every noon
the men lean against this weak support and sooner
or later it will give way under their weight.

We suggest that the railing be repaired at
the earliest convenience of the school. Such action
would remove the one hazard which might result in
a bad accident to some of the members of the student
body, perhaps, any day now.

I! a

O t C

 

The next thing that We came upon were the rick-
ety and curving stairs that lead up to the library
from the bottom of Draper hall. During the winter
months several accidents have occurred in which a
few men and women have received scratches and
bruises, resulting from the slippery stairs.

We offer three solutions to the problem. Perhaps
some rubber padding over the steps might prevent
the accidents. Or another hand railing would be a
good hpr in climbing up and down stairs. Another
suggestion would be to reconstruct an entire new en-
trance to the library or to block off the «present en-
trance. , , ,, , , '

Lastly, we wish to call to the attention of the
administration, the poor lighting facilities in Husted
hall. The chemistry department, especially, is very
poorly lighted. Students have to squint and crane
their necks in order to see the work on the black-
board. There are many other rooms in the school
which need better lighting facilities. We have one
suggestion to offer and that is the putting of brighter
lights or a better lighting system in these rooms.

i C‘ t Q It

On behalf of the student body We take this op-
portunity of letting the college and certain students
know about some of the hazards which can be easily
and quickly improved. Let us close with an apt quota-
tion: "An ounce of prevention is worth a pound of
cure."

Boole of the Welsh:

Katrina by Sally Salmlncn. Farrar and Rlnchart, Inc.,

(For rent in (he (Po-rm)

“Katrina” written by Sally Salmlncn. is the story
of u Norwegian servant girl who ls lul‘cd away from
her homo by the thoughts of a beautiful home in a
beautiful land, presented on the lips of her sailor
sweetheart. who doesn't realize that she has taken
his boasting scriously. When she arrives in Aland.
it is to find a ramshackle hut minus oven the ncccs-
lelcs of life, instead of the beautiful white house
with balconies and apple orchards l'ull of vari—colorcd

this! Johan. her husband, is a capable Senlllflll but
is considered a worthless braggart by the villagers.
Katrina finds ncrsclf hired out to the wealthy farmers,
for whom she must work. not on an equal bnsls. but
as a Common lubOl‘cl‘ receiving little or no pay.

During those years of trials, she has ucqulrod o

bctwwn Johan and her has been dcopcncd by their
misfortunes, and her tolerance, basal on bitter cx-
pcrlcncc, helps her make the host of her life and
thus help others.

It's not a luunorous or a pretty story; it is ugly,
bleak reality, and completely different from our ex-
pcrlcnccs and environment. It affords a revealing
picture of grim poverty and actual experiences, and
it certainly gives a new slant on life. minus the roses
and happy endings. Don’t let the title scare you of:
—-lt's really worth reading!

 

 

I, Personal
Viewpoints

We’re sorry about last week
but the aura of spring swept into
the open window and we opened
the door and went out into the
great outdoors.

But we must write this column
and so we proceed with the belief
that big dances at State college
are on trial. The courtroom will
be the Aurania club; the wit-
nesses, those persons who like to
dance; the facts, the results of
Soiree; the jury, committees for
future formals here; the issue,
big name bands versus small
ones.

It seems so odd that just a
little over one year ago this
movement toward bigger bands
commenced when senior hop
featured Harry Reser. Today on-
ly a year and a half have paSSed
and State has witnessed such top
orks as Berigan, Dailey, Coburn,
Hopkins, and Haymes. It is this
tradition to die? Do the stuuents
at State wish to return to the
days when unknowns such as
Valjean and Murphy and all the
rest whom We refuse to mention
because We have either forgotten
or we do not wish to recall,
reigned? Do We want dances
that are attended only because
of the desire to attend our class
dance?

We raise these questions
because the financial results of
Prom were not too encouraging
to those Sophs arranging Soiree.
The student body must; decide
the question and we are certain
that the outcome of Soiree will
carry great weight with dance
committees in the future.

It's up to you, you have a
privilege to hear one of the
greatest swing aggregations in
the country. You do not need
to take my word for that state-
ment. Listen to What bands
Paul Douglas compares Artie
Shaw‘s ork to: “Almost without
exception, every good swing out-
fit in the country is led by a
ranking instrumentalistaBunny
Berlgan, Artie Shaw, Jimmy
Dorsey, Red Norvo, Adrian Rol-
lini, Duke Ellington, Fats Waller,
Louis Armstrong." This is an
excerpt from the April issue of
Stage and it’s not bad company
for our sauve slgnior of the
slapstick to be associated with.

Downbeat ranks this orches-
tra as one of the smoothest of
the newest swing groups and
rave about the way they swing
out. The Musicians Poll shows
that Shaw is ranked second only
to Goodman on the licorice stick.
This is a reputation that few
bands coming to State can equal.
If this dance goes lo the red as
Prom did, then We fear that we’ll
trot around the next few years
to unknown groups of musicians.

Maybe the records in the Com-
mons do not appeal to you and
we feel that those are not the
best selections that the 'vic' com-
mittee could have made. If you
really wish on opus of swing
listen to Show on his own com-
position Monsoon.

To say a last word Why don‘t
you dig down into that old sock
and come around and have a
really good time, as well as mak-
ing good dances possible in the
future.

______PLAYGOER

Congratulations to Miss Hall for
a capany directed and well-chosen
assembly play. We are sorry that
she could not see the final perform-
ance of her own play.

One thing we have assimilated
during our three and some years’
stay at State is a tendency toward
jotting, so let us forego the discur-
sive method and mention our com-
ments in a more common form.

Sets—Good. Hurrah for the dis-
appearance of the “old lady's dress."
Did we recognize our favorite (?)
gold-fringed lamp?—-nghtlng—foull
Advancers should take time out for
light rehearsals.

Having “hailed from the sticks,"
we felt quite at home during the
performance, the characters were so
typical of the old home town. Could
see Miss Lynch hanging over the
back fence for a little chat with
next-door neighbor. She played her
role beautifully, with especially good
mouth expressions,

Miss Sinovoy gaVe her usual top
performance~never let it be said
that she doesn't make us believe in
herl

Mr. Arthur wasn't convincingly
hen-peeked. He held his interpreta-
tion of the character fairly well,
but we wish he had made us feel
with him.

Mr. Walsh gave us the impression
of being a happy-go-lucky twenty-
five year old, and brought in too
much of his own personality. Scares
well, ’tho.’

Mr. Leesc was a fine caricature of
what we have come to recognize as
the typed “grandpa from them thar
hills," especially in hls voice. We
appreciated him, however.

Felicitations to the audiencel But
then, an assembly audience is always
appreciative—Tuesday nighters, take
a lesson.

N. B. Here's watching and wait-
ing for the May production!

mural basketball contests, and the
President of Intramural Council,
Patsy Miranda.

Besides Miranda the selectors

Frank Quattrochl. Les Gertz, Paul
Schmitz, Bill Brophy, Mike Cym-
balck, George Mallinson, and Johnny

Intramural Basketball Season
Under Patsy Miranda, ’38,
Finishes Successfully

Last week the intramural basket-
ball season came to a close with an
uprising that saw third and fourth
plaCe teams knock off the leaders
and go into the finals of the playoffs.
Wednesday night Potter club defeat-
ed Albany No. 1 by a score of 21-18.
College House came through in the
second game to demolish the KDR’s
31-25. For Potter club, Rand and
Leggett shared the scoring honors,
While Schmitz was best for the losers.
College House, working as a perfect
combination, rolled up a margin by
means of fine pass-work, and deadly
shots. In the final game Thursday
night, College House defeated Pot-
ter club 27-23, and the Albany Up-
pcrclassmcn took KDR into camp
to the tune of 28-17. Edge and Wes-
scrman played fine ball for the
winners of the former tilt, while
Gaffney featured for the winners,
Schmitz again come through for the
Albany boys. By virtue of their vic-
Lory, College House won the playoffs
among the four leading teams. How-
ever, Albany, No. 1, by defeating
KDR clinched first place in the
league standing and therefore won
the championship. Albany No. 1
and KDR had previously been tied
for first place with but two defeats
apiece. The basketball season was
a distinct success, and praise is due
to Patsy Miranda for his fine organi-
zation of and his work with a new
system.

Another activity will blossom forth
shortly when the new volleyball
league swings into action. The teams
will represent the group houses just
as they did during the basketball
season. The schedule is already
being arranged and play will begin
soon.

The turnout for swimming has
been very poor so far. Unless there
is some improvement, this sport will
be dropped from the list of activities.
The captains should round up their
men and cooperate as much as pos-
siblc with manager Franccllo.

The ping-pong tournament has
remained practically at a standstill
because the top bracket has not been
arranged. The games will be play-
ed as soon as possible. Pool has
also bogged down lately. The bot-
tom brackci has reached the final
round with Ang Chcrro as the re-
malnlng finalist. The top round is
“gummlng up the works" at present,

Incidentally, there is wrestling in
the gym for all “grunt and groan"
urtlsts who desire to build up their
:framcs for the summer Wear and
:tcur. So for there haven't been
,cnough follows presan to beat the
dust out of the mats.

To Skit
Or
Not To Skit

B. Cw

We liked the banquet. We liked
Betty Morrow's emphasizing the
need for a women's coaching course
as a part of the college curriculum.
A. A. council has long realized this
need, and an investigating committee
recently petitioned the dean to es-
tablish such a course as it require-
ment.

The skit was a surprise. The com-
mittee for the Fall banquet decided
that the skit proposition was a
complete failure. The people parti-
cipating in the skit were able to be
present during only a part of the
banquet, and Were never able to de-
vote enough time to the preparation
of the skit to make it as amusing or
enjoyable as it should have been.
The skit always seemed to be a hasty
and not-too-well-pondered after—
thought. We thought that action of
the Fall banquet committee had set
an admirable precedent, but We were
mistaken. We suggest that future
committees seriously consider putting
more attention on the program as a
whole and eliminating the skit com-
pletely.

W. A. A. Has Banquet
0n Annual Sports Day

Dr. Brubacher, Deans Nelson and
Moreland Are Guests

 

 

The Women’s Athletic association
conducted its twenty-sixth annual
Winter banquet last Saturday as a
part of its annual Alumnae day.

Dr. A. R. Brubacher, president of
the college; Dr. Milton G. Nelson,
dean of the college; Miss Helen Hall
Morcland, dean of women; Miss Isa—
bel Johnston. director of physical
education were guests,

Immediately after the banquet
Miss Johnston presented the basket-
ball cup to Grace Yorkey, ’38, who
accepted it on behalf of her class
team, the winner of the interclass
tournament. After introducing the
various alumnae who were present,
Miss Johnston presented the speak-
er, Miss Elizabeth Morrow, last year's
president of the association.

Miss Morrow expressed her delight
at the great expansion of A. A.'s
program which has occurred this
year. She explained that partici-
pation in the association's program
is extremely valuable to a new
teacher, who is often required to
assist with the high school athletic
programs. Miss Morrow said that
she regretted A. A.'s lnablllty to pro-
vide coaching practice for more than
ten women each year, as this type of
knowledge and training ls particu-
larly needed in high schools.

Organizations Look Forward
To Next Year’s Program

Terminating a five week's play
and practice in one of the most suc-
cessful sports events of the year that
W. A. A. and M, A. A. have jointly
sponsored, the two organizations look
forward to a bigger and better indoor
sports carnival next year.

Not only was last week's affair a
social success, but it increased the
treasuries of W. A. A. and M. A. A.
by a twenty-five dollar margin.

City Champions Give Exhibition

Following a preliminary tilt in
badminton in which the finalists in
the men’s and women’s tournaments
played, Al Sloman and Tea Lipschltz,
of the Y. M. H. A., played the city
champions, Whitbeck Cuseck and
his partner, in a match that brought
“0115” and “ahs” to spectators lips.

Incidentally, because of increasing
interest shown in badminton, W. A.
A. and M. A. A. have obtained the
services of Ted Lipschitz to teach it
here. Sheets have been posted on
the W. A. A. and M. A. A. bulletin
boards for those interested to sign
up. Lipschitz will give lessons every
Monday night between 7:30 and 9:30
o'clock.

Following badminton, the specta-
tors were given a treat in the gentle
art of tumbling, captained by Bill
Torrens, '39, and aided by Bill Hopke,
'39, Bill Thomas and Al Weiss, soph-
omores.

Commons Revelry

After the sports events were over,
the spectators, en masse, went over
to the Commons where a variety of
interests awaited them. For once
the Terpslchorcan art was practically
deserted for these diverting pastimes.

In one corner “Guess Your
Weight" Ed Reynolds gave the fair
young ladies a once over—yes, and
guessed them correctly (l’) Nearby,
the men who were interested in their
lung capacity, used their ingenuity
and cleverness in a ping-pong blow-
ing contest.

In another spot the lure of doub-
ling your money was an attraction
in a penny throwing contest. Here,
in order to win, winning depended
on onc’s skill in throwing rings so
that they land on top of some loose
change. If you liked races, you
could put your money on your favor-
ite horse,--uh---I mean turtle, In-
cidentally, due to the Showmanship,
auctionecring, salesmanship (and
what hﬂVe you) of Paul Dittman. '38,
these rare racing tidbits were sold
to the highest bidders. (The prices
were sky-high, too).

To Miss Millie Shoreday went a.
remarkable door prize—a little chick.
The girls said, “oh how cute" and
the boys—well the boys thought the
chick was, uh, dandy.
