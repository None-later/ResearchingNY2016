STATE COLLEGE FOR TEACHERS, ALBANY, N. Y., APRIL 8, 1938

l Sophomore Searchers l

Seek Freshman Banner

Clad in dungarees, sweatshirts
and former, cast-off Easter bon-
nets, six dusty, grimy but grimly
determined sophomores pertly
pried their way into the hidden
i?) recesses of News office last
Tuesday night. Rivalry is here
again, fair friends!

One marvels at the persever-
ance of this little band, with a
few flashlights as their guides,
intently searching for that mys-
tical might of the freshman, the
frosh banner. The aggregation.
headed by the man under the
black sombrero. namely, Walt
Simmons. was so intent upon
their quest that not even Ko-
walsky's red—striped socks cs-
capcd their most assiduous in-
vcstigation.
