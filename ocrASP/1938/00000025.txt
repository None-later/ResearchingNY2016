were then dismissed. ,

However under the new plan, these
tests will be given during the sum-
mer before the candidate is admitted
as a member of the freshmen class.
Thus if anyone is found unsatisfac-i
tory and dismissed he will be saved:
the embm'assmcnt and disappoint-
ment that would result under the,
old system. Also any person rejected;
will have the alternative of matricu— I
lating at another institution.

Each prospective freshman, under.
the new plan, after filing an appli-
cation, will come to Albany between
July 11 and August 15 for a personal
interview, speech and voice tests.
and a physical examination. The.
candidate first will have an inter-
view with three faculty members ofl
the committee on admissions whoi
will rate him on such qualities,
necessary in a good teacher, taking,
.especial note of appearance, person- ‘
ality. culture. conduct. and command
of English. Following this, the can—
didate will be given a complete
speech and voice test, recently dc-
vised by Mr. William G. Hardy, iii-i
structor in English. This test is the
result of extended research work on
the part of Mr. Hardy during the
past. year, These tests will be con-,
chided with a thorough physical ex- 1

 

 

Any remedial defects will then be
corrected at once.
This system of interviewing can-

,didati-s for admission was first put,

.into operation last summer when

.‘scvi-nly transfer students applied for

admission. Due to the fact that
,lhei'e were only thirty vacancies. this
llil'tlt‘l‘dlll't' was adopted in Ol’ilL‘l' t0

Critics Praise Donahue

In Current Stage Role

’l‘heatergocrs this season have
been interested in the modern
production of Shakespeare's
"Julius Caesar," staged by Orson
Welles. The play, in the nature
of an experiment. is dotie with-
out the conventional stage pro-
perties. and in modern dress,
with some attempt to satirize
the present-day dictators.

But what makes the play more
interesting to State college stu-
dents is the fact that Vincent
Donahue of the class of 1936 is a
member of the cast of one of the
road shows that is touring the
country. Donahue, who was
prominent in college dramatics,
has the role of Cinna, the poet,
who was mistaken for China, the
conspirator, and killed by
Caesar's followers.

Although the role is not one of
primary importaiwc necessarily.
Donahue has been givuig such
fine performances that critics
have given him especially com—
plimentary write-ups. The Bos-
ton critiCs mentioned the sym-
pathetic and subtle interpreta-
tion that he has maintained.

As an undergraduate, Donahue
was not only active in the week-
ly Advanced Draiiiatics plays,
but played the role of Tom Petti-
grcw in the May production of
‘ “Berkeley Square."
