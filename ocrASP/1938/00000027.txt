For the daily

leave for Poughkeepsie as delegates
to the Middle Atlantic Regional con-
ference of the National Student Fed-
eration of America to be conducted
at Vassar college on Saturday and
Sunday, May 7-8. The delegates are
Richard Lonsdale, ‘39, N. S. F. A.
representative here, John Edge and
Duntan Tynan, juniors, who were
recently elected by the student body,
and Betty Hayford, ’39, who will
leave as a self-paying delegate, but
nevertheless official,

The program will consist cf regis-
tration, luncheon, and introductory
speeches by Arthur Northwood, Jr.,

to evade the young freshmen.
We extend our sympathy to
the weal-led members of Mys-
kanla who have to keep the
“hunters” under their watchful
eye. Solnc enterprising mem-
bers have grown so tired that
they are using a horsecar to
carry them back and forth.
However, no matter how tired
the freshmen are, they have
shown great rivalry spirit. Every
night their youthful voices can
be heard in the empty corridors
of learning. But alas! the fresh-
men have not yet found the

clude their weekend activities with
formal spring house dances tomor-
row night from 9:00 until 1:00
o’clock.

The committees for the dances in-
clude:

tiglionc, ’30; refreshments, Ethel

f State college soror-
‘ities and their guests will gather at
the Aurania club tonight to attend
Intersorority ball, which is the open-
ing event of the annual Intersorority
weekend. Anthony Trini and his
orchestra will provide music for the
dance, which will be conducted from
10:00 to 2:00 o'clock, according to
Elizabeth Daniels, '38, president of
the council.

Individual luncheons and formal
dances tomorrow will complete the
weekend activities for the sororities.
