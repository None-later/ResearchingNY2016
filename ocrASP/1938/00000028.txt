Clean Politics.D

The present system of campaigning is
as worthless as the previous setup of no
campaigns, It has by no means cleaned up
the political rubbish and has not made the
voters any more aware of the qualities of
the candidates.

The only result of the present system
seems to be the introduction of a not too in-
teresting assembly into a year of good ones.
The candidates usually give a much better
speech than their managers because theirs
are shorter alld not filled with so much
"azmataz’ of political hooey. The speeches
really impress no one because the voters’
minds are usually set so firme before they
enter the assembly that no oratory, not even
the most eloquent and fiery, could change
them.

The system was intended to bring the
elections out into the open, bring them out
of the locker rooms, fraternity houses, so-
rorities. The question is——has it done this '3
l/"c do not believe so. We think the condi-
tions are exactly as they were before—«no
better and no worse. The posters are
either ignored or else laughed at. And no
wondcr——~l'or they have no interest arousing
l'calurcs and show little original thinking.

The spoccllcs howcvl-r arc the Worst
l'cnlurc. \Vc think the students should votc
on tho best spcukcr in the school, lhcn havc
him iuldl'css illc osscrnbly sliding on lili-
pressivc record but llll‘lliilillillif no pul'licu—
lur candidufc. Then, how him rcud the list
of candidates. lly this methods \vc would
be as little borcd as possiblc and wc, lllc
assembly, would not hcar the same speech
rcpcnlcd so many limes.

With the present syslcm ihcro is only
one difficulty. it is unwurkublc and has as
little a chance of succeeding as an honor
system has, Perhaps this is uncomplimcn-
tary to our students but it is not an untruth.
Let’s return to the old system and accom-
plish the some ends without boredom.

 

Tea and Technicians

 

 

COMMENTSTATER

A little while back we mentioned the absence of
Lounge teas this year, but apparently our intention
was either ignored or misunderstood. It was our pur-
pose to encourage a little fellowship around college
because We felt that the Lounge teas provided an op-
portunity to students to meet and talk informally. We
even hailed them as being a real chance for some bull
sessions and more down-to-earth discussions. How-
ever, the Lounge committee must have interpreted our
stand as a plea for more free lunches at 3:30 o’clock,
because nothing much was done about it.

When we were home for vacations this year, We
learned that our fellow-collegians from Columbia and
neighboring universities had adopted the John Bull
custom of afternoon tea, even to the point of holding
some classes around the tea-table. We could not help
but feel that the frank and friendly discussions that
resulted there were a fiile form of college life. And
so we’re not discouraged by the advent of Spring and
the out-of—door movement.

Although the weather is less condusive to teas,
now is the time to prepare for next year's social sea-
son. The Lounge tea is subsidizcd by the Student as-
sociation budget, and the budget will come before the
assembly very soon. Why not plan now for "lore fre-
quent and larger teas—-perhaps every week—not just
a Christmas tea and a St. Patrick's day tea, bill; a
definite tlnlc set apart, alld a genuinely hospitable

atmosphere for the cold afternoons next winter?
iii it! y

 

 

Returning after an absence of more than a year,
Gilbert and Sullivan, through the medium of “The
Sorcerers,” came back into their own, and we were
more than glad to see them. The failure of last year's
production to get any farther than first base was a
great disappointment to us. The performance was
certainly a creditable one, aild our congratulations go
to Dr. Candlyn, Miss Cassavant, the cast, and, lil fact,
everyone who helped to make it such a success.

ix 4 *

Impartial observers at the annual Debate confer-
ence which was conducted at Union last weekend, Were
unanimous in their opinion that State college students
were on their toes regarding parliamentary procedure.
We might call it transfer of training fronl a course of
that name, but We like to feel that We have repre-
senting us people who are well-informed. not only in
the field of speaking, but who are experts in the fiile
points of the game. It gives us some satisfaction to
think that we haVC a group of technicians who can
speak with authority and exactness.

Boo/r of the Wee/3.:
Make Your Enemies Now

How to Lose Friends and Alienate People, by Irving D.

Tresslcr, Stackpole Sells, New York, 1937, 247 pp.

(On sale in. ch co-op)
“This book is dedicated
to a man who doesn't
need to read it:
Adolf Hitler,"

With such a dedication, Irving D. ’I‘rcsslcr, presi-
dent of tile Irving D, Trcsslcr Institute of Human Re-
lations Up to a Certain Point and How to Keep Them
at That Point, arrives on the social scene to restore
chaos and confusion to socicly's present day order of
things. Advocating that the ('xccsslvc social activity
of today needs disruption, ’I‘rcsslcr maintains that
"He who is rich ill friends is poor ill privacy."

For those of you who long to don the cloak of
privacy and cast off the burden of social llltl‘i‘lfolll'ﬁl‘,
here within lhc covers a lilllc l'cd book are discussed
countlcss, practical methods of sccurinu the blessings
of pcucc und scclusion,

Adhcl'c to his principles and ’l‘rcsslcr guui'unlccs lo
bring nnnlcdililc rcsulls. “Start an argument," he says,
"and iilnkc an enemy. Make an enemy and lose it
friend. Lose a friend and gain some lime to yourself.”
One of the points he emphasizes is that if you‘re wrong,
don't. admit it. “Any fool cull admit he‘s wrong and
apologize, but it takes genuine strength to stand up
for what one knows is wrong and be willing to fight

 

for it."

Personal
Viewpoints

Ladies and Gentlemen, today
I am nominating a man who
during the past three weeks has
presented you the prettiest post-
ers in State—original Petty girls.
Wow. He has read you the funny
sheets, done crossword puzzles,
and promised you all that you
ever could wish to be promised.
Hasn’t he developed the smooth-
est hand shake in State, the
sweetest smile—Pepsodent gar-
gled and Ipanaed—just for you,
my friends? Yes, I am speak-
ing, my chums, of your friend
of the fireside, Palsy Perlmutter.
Of course, I cannot tell you of all
his sterling qualities for you did
not see him as stroke of the
varsity crew at Stocking Runs,
nor did you see him as third
vice-president of the Way high
club. A marvelous lad is my man.
In his days at State he has pass-
ed Oral English with a C- and
has tried out four times for the
debate squad. Could he help it
if he lisped—at least he had per-
severance.

Nor has his social life been ile—
glected? Has he not hounded the
Commons, has he not learned to
play bridge, doesn‘t he know
‘mac’ as Mac? The answer to
all these is yes, undeniably Yes
. . Hasn't he always asked
someone to State's dances and
nightly has he ilot occupied a
different sorority house? There
is not a sofa that has not borne
his weight. Yes, here is your
silver tongucd socialite.

Nor has his Stately career
been Without honors, has he not
been secretary of the Commerce
club and president. yes president,
of the Italian club and an all
around intramural athlete. Of
course, he is a member of my
fraternity but that does not
enter into it. It would make no
difference to me what group he
was affiliated with because I am
sure his sterling worth would
stand out to me, Maybe a great
many of you do not kllow him
but I am sure you will like him.

Today I am nominating and
speaking for the next assistant
cheer leader of State college. His
fate is in your hands, remember
our slogan “Pcrllllutter Promises
Perpetual Promises.”

By the time this noble epistle of
truth reaches you that duel of dirt
and dirty work will be Just about
over. “It was a hard fight, but we
won, ma.” Outside of the political
arena, little of importance took
place this week due to lack of time,
but we managed to get a few tales.

Who was the young lady in a

screamed, “My God I‘m scalding to

for moral reason to replace certain
words ill the actual quotation.

Ed Tomasinn, '40. both playing a
beautiful gulllc of tennis, won their
rcspcclivc singles while Cyril Kilb
and Stall Smith, freshmen hopefuls,
flost theirs,

In the doubles malchcs, State and
Bard cnch took one with the fate of
the winningI school at stake. Tomas—
‘nil, paired wilh Kilb, played a bean-
tiful offensive and defensive game
with both men hitting every offering
of their opponents fronl some nigh
impossible p05itions, and returning
beautifully, placed shots with inter-
est. They took the first match easi-
ly, winning 6-1, lost the second, and
nosed out the Redlileil in the last
by a hard fought 6—4 set. Because
of rain, the match with Vermont was
called off and will be played at a
latter (late.

This week‘s schedule is of special
interest to the Purple and Gold
squad. In addition to meeting Drew
today, tllcy journey to Brooklyn to-
morrow where they stack up against
St. John‘s university for the first
time.

Calm to Meet Champ

St. John‘s boasts of a champion on
its squad, namely Fishback, number
1 man and the winner of the junior
indoor college tennis tournament of
America, Fishback won tllc champ—
ionship last winter. Captain Cahn
is slated to meet him ill the singles
matches alld will no doubt meet him
ill the doubles matches.

Cahll is confident til at til 0
teachers will be more than a match
for Drew and he believes that our
chances are fifty-fifty ill beating St.
John's,

The boys have been slowly but
surely rounding into shape, The only
question mark on tile team’s chances
is captain Cullil himself. Calln
seems to find trouble with his over-
hliild stroke and serve. He is work-
ing on this weakness and hopes to be
rid of it soon.

Will Frumcnt still stands undefeat-
cd over a lwo year period, winning
his singles and double matches easily
and in fine style. Tomasiun and
Rand, showing better form than they
haVc yet shown before, promise to
be the backbone of the team, Kilb
and Smith show promise of being
valuable plnycrs ill the near future

Men Fail To Support
Softball Intramurals

Once again, a manager of one
of M. A, A.’s sub-divisions is in
difficulty — a swell schedule,
swell softballs, swell manager,
but no support.

Joe has even gone so far as to
collect numerous names off’n the
men’s bulletin board, all of whom
signed up on a poster for intra-
mural softball, and wrapped the
men into teams and the teams
into a schedule—but no support.

Any day now, Monday, Tues-
day, Wednesday or Thursday, a
whole team may show up for its
’ scheduled game. If it doesn’t do
, that, it might even try to make
‘ up a postponed game on Friday,
or anyone of these days, if the
equipment is available. Who can
tell but when someone besides
Joe will come around to look at
them, even handle them care-
fully.

Funny how this lack of sup-
port grows Oil :1 person especially
after M, A. A. tries so hard—Joe
Bosley, too. By the way, Ken

Baseball Squad
“We Trip

Varsity Nine Conquers R.P.l.
In Close Battle, 4-2;
Defeat Bard, 17-10

State’s baseball nine, fresh from
the victories of the R, P. I, and
Bard weekends, will once more don
spikes and gloves for a busy time
today and tomorrow. Both the game
today with Hamilton and the contest
with Cortland tomorrow will take
place on hostile territory.

Coach Hatfield has announced the
probable batteries for the two games.
At Hamilton, Van Keuran, R. P. I’s
nemesis, will be stinging them in
from the mound, with Augustine
doing the catching.

Lehman, the iron hoss of the Bard
set-to will probably see action again
tomorrow ill the Cortland fracas.
His backstop will be Peattie.

Friday’s game with R. P. I. was
hard fought and well played. by
both sides of the Hudson. State
stayed behind until the sixth inning,
trailing 2-1, when they drafted three
runs across to keep a steady margin
for the rest of the game and to win

One of the best heaves of the
game was gotten off by Thomas,
whose [leg to the plate cut down an
R, P. I. man attempting to stretch
a safe triple into a shaky homer.
The three winning tallies in the sixth
Were brought about by a walk, a
pair of singles and a double steal.

Feature of the game was Van
Keuran's hurling. Witll the support
that was missing ill ills first contest
of the season, he turned in an envia-
ble performance.

The game was played for seven
innings in a drizzling rain, and
lasted for three and a half hours.
Bard matched each State tally until
the big inning of the eighth when
the State boys cooled their ardor
with the eight run rally. Quatt-
rochi was tlle slugging star with two
doubles of the spree.

Fairbanks, supplanting Lehman,
was the winning pitcher. He also
helped to win the ball game by lead-
ing the teachers at bat, putting in
three runs. Filsinger of Bard
smacked three doubles.
