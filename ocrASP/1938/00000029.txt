Dr. Arthur K. Beik, professor in
education, for eleven years faculty
advisor to Chi chapter of Kappa Phi
Kappa, national education fratern-
ity, will be tendered a testimonial
banquet at Jack’s, Thursday, May 12,
at 6:30 o’clock.

The testimonial to Dr. Beik, ac-
cording to president Thomas Ryan,
'38, will take the form of a “Spring

rection of Lawrence W. Strattner, ’39.

President Ryan has obtained Dr.
Riverda Jordan, Professor of Educa-

It has been the custom in past
years to award an honorary key to

of education, and the identity of the
recipient of this key is awaited with
interest. At the fall banquet in Nov-
ember a similar key was presented
to Dr. Adna W. Risley, professor of
history.

Kappa Phi Kappa has announced
its new pledges: Robert Agone, Har-
ry Bergstein, William Bogosta, Hall
Downey, John Edge, Leonard Fried-
lander, William Hopke, Joseph Mug—
