State Nine Drops Shut-out
To Strong Hartwic/e Team

Sixth, Seventh Inning Hits
By Hartwick Nine Score
Thirteen Runs

Ye Gods of Sports laughed aloud
last Saturday afternoon as the State
nine tossed and booted the ball to
all corners of the Hartwick park, for
when the dust cleared away, the
Hartwlck boys had crossed the plate
twenty times while State contented
themselves with eight goose eggs.
Yes, the final score was 20-0; but
this score does not tell the sad story
of the game. Van Keuran, on the
mound for State, hurled fine ball
for five innings, during which Hart-
wlck scored one run on two errors
and an infield out, State in the
meantime kept things clean with
a row of neat ciphers. Then the
boys came through with a fine case
of dropsy and wild fielding that con-
tributed seven runs in the frame and
ten more in the seventh. Solid hits
rattled off the Hartwick bats which,
along with erratic support, account-
ed for the mighty basketball score.

In justice to Van Keuran it must
be said that he pitched a fine game.
He certainly did not deserve the
beating he absorbed. The fielding,
which has been faulty at times, was
beyond words, while the hitting was
extremely weak. State just didn’t
pack the punch to drive over the
necessary tallies.

Hartwick has a fine squad which
is conceded to be one of the strong-
est in the state and it is certainly
no disgrace to be beaten by them.

The loss of Schmitz, last year's
hurling star, and Larry Balog, second
baseman of '37, has been a severe
blow to State's hopes and is partially
responsible for a disappointing sea-
son. We hope that they can close
the season this week with a victory
over the Pratt nine. State opened
against Pratt in New York last
April and took it on the chin to the
tune of 13-5. This, too, was a loose-
ly played game in which Pratt earn-
ed only three runs of their entire
total. Let us hope that improvement
will be shown in the final contest
and that State will display a brand
of baseball of which they are capable.

The box score by innings is:
State 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
Hartwick 1 0 0 (l O 7 10 2 20

Chess Team Wins Over
Mt. Pleasant Champs

Shades of chess nuts, the State
chess team has done it again!
Meeting the champs of Mt.
Pleasant, of Schenectady, the
checkmaters took three straight
games to clinch the match for
their second win of the season.

Captalned by Steve “Shaw”
Szawlowski, '40, and managed by
Lee Durllng, '41, the formation
of the chess varsity, the first
of its kind here, is the outgrowth
of the M. A. A. sponsored chess
tournament held earlier in the
spring.

Seeing that there was an in-
tense interest in this parlor
sport, the boys decided to form a
team made up of the cream 01'
the crop and play the represen-
tatives of local and Capital Dis-
trict chess clubs,

The boys’ initial victory was
scored against an Albany group.
winning 4-1. In Sunday‘s match,
Doug Murphy, Lou Franceilo.
and “Slim” Hoose won their re-
spective matches while Caramia
and Szawlowski lost by close
moves to take the match, 3-2.

M. A. A.! Attention! Nurse
this mewling but growing infant
and give the men yet another
sport to particrpate in.

Squad to Play First Game
At Home on Saturday
With Bard Team

To even up the beating given the
Feds on the diamond last Saturday,
the netmen of Minerva journeyed
along and bested Hartwick’s aggres-
sive courts-delegation to the tune
on 7-2.

Since the racket wielders had es-
tablished a losing percentage by vir—
tue of losses to Drew and St. John's
on the previous weekend after their
initial game and victory over the
,Bard squad, this game also served
a second purpose in bringing the
future Bridges up to real scoring
position on the right side of the
column.

The trip to Hartwick was the third
of a series of four “away” games.
R. P. I. was to witness the fourth
on the Troy courts, yesterday.

The game, originally scheduled for
Wednesday, was rained out, defeat-
ing the Fed's urgent desires to get
back on the win side.

Tomorrow, you home fans will
have the first chance this season
to see the local sports aggregation
in action on home courts, when the
second game with Bard is scheduled.
Odds are in favor of" the teachers to
repeat.

The place of this game was not
decided at the time of printing oi
the News, but such information may
be found on the men's bulletin board,
now.

The dccisivo victory garnered over
Hurtwick came with the full blast
of the Tcnchcrs' wrath, absorbed in
the two prcvlous losess, descending
on ihc confident homctowners,

Frament, Calm, Rand, Smith and
Doran blazed the opposition from
the COlli'is by winning their singles
matches in no uncertain tones. From
these matches, Hartwick had to be
content with taking only one victory.

’1‘0 acid to its score, the purple and
gold followers look the doubles, 2-1.
Frament, number one man by virtue
01' his victory over Captain Harold
Cahn in the recent “ladder tourna—
ment," teamed up with his captain
to smash thru to a win.

Rand and Smith duplicated this
feat by subjugullng Liic second On-
contu doubles team, In the third
match, Kllb und Dorun fclt the sting
of defeat when they dropped their
match to the homclown lads, but
'lhis loss had little effect on the
standing at such a late slugc of the
mulch.

New Myskania Includes 7 Men and 6 Women

The tenseness of suspense seized l
the whole strident body along with
the faculty and guests for Moving-up 1

skanla took place last Friday in the.
auditorium of Page hall after the
actual moving-up had been effected.
Tradition was broken when
Myskania decided not to do what.
was expected, that  choose the new ‘
Myskania alphabetically. Anxiety;
was changed to outbursting excite-
ment when O‘Horu followed on the
heels of Ades and Baker. Everybody
knew then that anything could hap-
pen. Myskania certainly had the
names juggled up as Adcs. Baker,
O’Hora, Hcrlwig, Friedlander, Rock-
efeller, Hayford, Tynan, Mattlce,
Hershkowltz, Edge and Strong were
tapped in that ordcr.

It looked as if the mmibcr would
be lwcivc at first, but Myskania had
a bug of surpriscs Friday. After

Many Summer Students
Need Social Security

Prosperity is just around the
corner, so they say. However,
We know that this summer
there will be a great many more
college students working in
hotels, camps and other summer
resorts than ever before. Mrs.
Anna M, Rosenberg, regional di-
rector of the Social Security
Board for New York state, wishes
to remind all students, who take
part-time or temporary jobs dur-
ing the summer vacation, to ob-
tain social security numbers.

Under the Federal Old-Age
Insurance plan which includes
part-time. temporary, and casual
work, the employers are required
to file reports on wage records
with the Bureau of Internal
Revenue, and the employees,
therefore, must report their ac-
count numbers. Another import-
ant feature of the plan is that
the amount an individual ulti-
mately receives will be based on
his total wages while engaged in
employment covered by the
Social Security Act. All wages
are entered into the employee’s
accounts in Albany.

Betty Bunce To Head

Press Bureau Board

Press Bureau, founded in 1935, has
grown until it has become an im-
portant activity of the college. The
work of the bureau consists of pub-
licizing the activities of State col-
lege students by sending releases to
local newspapers telling of appoint-
ments to teaching positions, partici-
pation in activities, and honors be-
stowed upon them by the college.

Appointments to the press bureau
board include: chairman, Betty
Bunce, '40; seniors, Robert Hertwig,
Edgar O'Hara and Jean Strong;
juniors, Alice Bartlow, Robert Cog-
gcr, Saul Greenwald, Otto Howe,
and Sally Young; sophomores, Alice
Abclovc, Stevo Kusak, Irene Pogor
and Ruperta Simmons.

During the past year press bureau
has sent out 1600 letters, publicizing
the activities of its students. This
year it will attempt to get recogni-
tion on the Student association bud-
