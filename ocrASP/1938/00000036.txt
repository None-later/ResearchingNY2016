Revision b7 Rivalry Regulations
To Result in Rip-roaring Races

 

 

When next year’s hopefuls, the
class of 1942, enter the portals of
State, they will be greeted by a set
of rivalry rules quite unlike those
that faced their predecessor and
rival, the present class of 1941. The
following changes were recently
made by Student Association.

Under the new system mascot
hunting will be much fairer. In-
stead of the sophomore class hiding
the mascot and gaining their five
points when the freshmen fail to
discover its hiding place, Myskania
will now conceal the small image
and both classes will hunt for it.
If one of the classes finds it, they
will gain the coveted five points.
If not, there will be no losses or
gains on either side. This will elim-
inate as well the passing of mascot
from sister class to sister class.

In athletic contests many new
events have been added. The men of
the two classes will be given an op-
portunity to show their prowess in
football, even if it be only touch-
tackle. Three points will be awarded
to the winning team. Likewise the
girls of the rival classes will engage
in a hockey game, the same number
of points to be awarded the victor
of this contest.

Moreover, next year, the men will
compete in a softball game, as well
as the girls, adding the possibility of
another three points to either side.
In the event of a tie in any of the
athletic events, as was experienced
in this year's clash, at deciding game
shall be played.

The newest innovation in rivalry
is the "tug of war” gaining two
points for the class whose team, con-
sisting of twenty-five men or any
other number determined by the
rivals, shall successfully pull the op-
posing team through a stream of
water which shall be half-way
between the two classes at the open-
ing of the tug.

Naked Freshman Rides—
In Waste Paper Basket

Monday afternoon proved to
be an embarrassing day in the
life of an adventurous freshman.
Some ardent sophomores, emp-
tying out the large canvas waste
paper basket in the men’s lock-
er room, dumped a protesting
freshman, naked, from the show-
er room into the basket and
pushed it out into the hall near
the girls' locker room.

One young lady, passing by,
turned red as a beet, and ex-
claimed, “Oh my." Another one,
seeing what happened, stared,
then blushed, and with a slight
scream, refused to go any fur-
ther, and fled back down the
hall. Still another young lady
passed by and observed the fel-
low's discomfort. She was a gay,
bold young spirit; she passed the
freshman in the basket laugh-
ingly, and perhaps, We could not
see, cast a side glance at the
dripping freshman. What ex-
treme types of girls We have at
this institution!

The poor fellow, turning red-
der by the moment, begged and
beseeched the laughing men in
the hall to push him into the
locker room. No one was willing
to do so until a voice of auth-
ority quelled the entertainment.

President Brubacher, disturb-
ed by the noise as he walked
down Draper hall, admonished
them to be a little less boister-
ous in their activities. The fel-
lows, heeding his request, end-
ed the sport by pushing the
freshman back into the shower
room where he completed his
semi-yearly ablutions.

“Chesterﬁeld’s my brand
because they give me more
pleasure than any cigarette

I ever smokedwbar none.”

More smokers every day
find a new brand of smoking
pleasure in Chcstcriicld’s refresh-
ing mildncss and better tastc.

It’s because Cbcstcriiclds are
made of mild ripc tobaccns and
pure cigarette paper—4% fincst
ingredients a cigarette can have.
