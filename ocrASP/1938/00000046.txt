An organization very much in the market for bright shiny cinema starlets is Darryl
F. Zanuck’s 20th Century-Fox. Having found Marjorie Weaver of the University of Ken-
tucky campus, this company is now dipping into its coffers to get you and me to know
her better. The alumnae of- Kappa Kappa Gamma at Kentucky already know her well.

It is one of those stories. A fan magazine was offering a dance scholarship to the
prettiest face in the country. Judy Parks, her Kappa roommate, sent in Marjorie's picture.
That was practically all there was to it. Zanuck’s boys were around soon after winner Miss
Weaver arrived in New York to claim the prize. So you’ll see her dancing in Sally Irene
and Mary, Marjorie playing "Mary," Fred Allen doing the comedy. ’ ’

In case they haven’t yet come your way, look hard for Marjorie in This I; My Affair
and Life Begin; at College. It won’t be hard to ﬁnd her in Tyrone POWer’s arms as they
play "Second Honeymoon." judy Parks, who sent that picture from the Kappa house is
Marjorie’s stand-in and roommate in Hollywood, ’

And just to make you believe more in her Kentucky loyalty, she's shown below read—

"ch, Ben, Camels are a lot different. That's why
they're the racing drivers‘ favorite. To fellows like
us, there are so many things that mean a great deal
in smoking. One big angle that carries weight with
me is that Camels agree with me.’ I've smoked a
good many thousands of Camels in the past to
years, so I know that from experience."

“Camels are
preferred by the
tobacco growers,

who know leaf

tobacco from
the ground up”

according to the
observation of tobacco
planters themselves

Thomas Middle-
ton and his twin
brother James
have been grow-
ing tobacco for 14
years. “The Cam-
el people bought
up my best tobacco last year,"Tom
Middleton says. “They have for 12
years. When anyone talks about
liner, more expensive tobaccos,
that means Camels to me. I smoke
-’em~my brother smokes ’em—and
so do most of us around here who
grow and know tobacco.”

Henderson Carroll
has been growing
tobacco for 18 years.
“For my own smok-
ing," he says, “I
like Camels. I know
the (lame! buyers
purchased just about every top-
grudc lot of tobacco at the sales I
wont to last year. My own crop
was a dandy. And,ns usual.(‘amel
got the best of it.”

“I’ve been plant-
int,r tobacco for 130
years,"saysllurry
C. King, a suc-
ccssl‘ul grower,
who knows tobac-
colrornthcgrouml
up because he grows it. “(‘nmcl
bought the choice lots of my last
tobacco crop —— paid more for my
best leaf tobacco. So I know they
use lint-r, more expensive tobaccos
in Camel cigarettes. That's one
mighty good reason why my ciga-
rette is Camel."

"Down at the

tobacco ware-

house they told

me they'd never

seen liner tobac-

co than my last I
crop. ” says J. E. .3
Jenkins, veterah tobacco grower.
"(Jamel bought all the top grades.
It shows that the Carnal people
make sure to get the choice lots of to-
bacco. I prefer Camels every time."
