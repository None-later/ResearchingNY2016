Ant! .1 Text j 1 Tiny 1.02..-

A lot of publicity and very little ro-
mance was started when R. M. Brandin
and W. A. Gilroy (a! left) began Prince-
ton’s Lonely Hearts Club. When they
advertised in the Vassar neWspaper, "Hun-
dreds of men are lonely in Princeton. Are
you lonely, too? Find your post-box lover
by writing the Lonely Hearts Club,” they
received stacks of responses. But Vassar
venuses (below) claim it was all in fun
and are shown giving the razzberry to the
melancholy Tigers. Meanwhile, University
of Toledo’s Edmund Keefer (right) in-
vented a "cupidoscope" which allegedly
tests "true love.” The prospects for matri-
mony hold hands, hold electrodes on the
machine, and a meter tells them whether
or not they should proceed with the affair.

and procedures that make them important and indis-
pensable members of our communities'puzzles many
collegians and average‘citizens alike. In this chapter
of This I; College, COLLEGIATE DIGEST tells the pic-
ture story of the purely mechanical side of a dentist’s
education, reminding its readers that there is much
more to dental training than mere chiseling and drill-
ing. Follow this interesting and informative series N A _ , a I
