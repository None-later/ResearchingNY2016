To give young men of the farms a broad educational * -»-
contact which will train them to be better farmers and _m ' 4
better citizens is the purpose of the “Farm Folk School” .
operated during the snow season by the University of
Wisconsin college of agriculture.

The school’s term runs each year from the middle of
November to the middle of March, days during which
active farm work is curtailed by the cold and the snow.

The full course requires two terms, but many go back for

the third and fourth. Average age of the 300 students is

22 years. The entire four months’ course, including food, / ‘

shelter and tuition, costs but $97.50—and this includes ' - - - I NgﬁsNngEstN

The course of study is built around the social and cultural O .-
needs, as well as the vocational interests, of America’s
future farm leaders. The former course gives them an
acquaintance with economics, history, sociology and politi- . . .
cal science. The latter covers all phases of farming. - .  .
Plans are now being made to extend this type of train- J -
ing to the farm girls of the state, so that they, too, can  u

use their winter months’ leisure to train themselves for _' 1 ‘ 
more efﬁcient and intelligent summer months' activity.  I
