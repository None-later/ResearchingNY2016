Mt. Holyoke’r ﬁrst male president

To the lone society of two men who are presi’
dents of eastern women’s colleges, has now been
added Dr. Roswell Gray Ham. An cit-captain in
the U. S. Marines, he has been selected to head
Mt. Holyoke College, the ﬁrst male president in
its 101 years. It began as a female seminary in
1836, today is pioneer among schools to olier
higher education to women.

It took almost a regiment of Marines to over-
come the opposition to Dr. Ham’s appointment
He personally was under no harsh scrutiny. He
had taught in Woman's College of Albertus
Magnus and had faced co-eds at the Universities
of California and Washington. It was just that

74-year-old President Mary Emma Wooley, Mt.
Holyolte had grown to an eight-and-a-hali million
endowment. During her 37-year administration,
enrollment has doubled, the faculty quadrupled.

Dr. Ham is 45, six-foot-three, a native of Cali-

and Vassar's Henry Noble McCraclten, who have
