Sigma Alpha Epsilon ([09 chapters,
32,500 living members). One of Ameri-

' ca’s most pretentious national fraternity
conventions is that staged by SAE’s
ofﬁcers and Eminent Supreme Recorder

: Lauren Foreman. Distinguished by its

w  seriousness. of purpose, a prominent
 11 place on its program is given to a
i ‘ Leadership School for the training of

undergraduate fraternity leaders. Most
serious are its general sessions, where
discussions of ritual, scholarship, fra-
ternity history and purposes do not let
undergraduate delegates forget the
great social aims and accomplishments
of college fraternalism. Not unlike
other fraternities is SAE in its con-
vention program. Here COLLEGIATE
DIGEST presents typical scenes from a
typical college fraternity convention
taken at the SAE meeting in Evans-
ton, Ill.
