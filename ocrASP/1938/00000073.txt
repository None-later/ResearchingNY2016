YOU THINK, and IT WRITESI Before you touch
point to paper, the Dry-Proof Cap keeps the
tip moist, ready-to-go. When it touches paper,
the platinum-channeled Feathertouch° point
flows freely, instantly. While you write, Stream-
lined Balance° design prevents hand fatigue,
offsets brain inaccuracy. As you're writing, the
visibility feature warns when to refill. And when
you refill, ONE forceful stroke empties, cleans,
fills, keeps the pen fit. . . As the years of use-
fulness add up, you realize the economy of a .
Sheaffer pen. Through school, through business, ,, 0...,
through life—Carve a Career with Sheaffer'sl
