on the stage at assembly this
morning, bttt only twelve of them

courage for this fellow to make
such a decision, this fellow who
has been secretary of the student
association, president of his
class, chairman of junior guides.

But if Dunt, thinks it best,

teetiiig of the student body when
we wish him nothing btit the
best on his new venture.
