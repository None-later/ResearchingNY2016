College can give many things——knowi-
edge, sociability, personality. These things
are acknowledged— but too little time is
given to the thought that college can also
make us cultured, interested and interest-
ing people—able to enjoy adult life to the
fullest.

Throughout college we have the chance
to acquire abilities, skills, and habits of ap-
preciation that will enable us to be coll-
tented as teachers. We havo here ill Al-
bany a last cultural background that we
can draw upon —— stage. shows, concerts,
good libraries, popular amusements. ll‘rol'n
these fields We ought to be able to acquire
a taste for those pleasures that will bring
us lasting pleasure and joy.

To you i'rcshlllcn, a succcssi'ul graduate
of State will not bc ihc person who signs
up for and makcs Alyskania, nor necessarily
the stoogc who grinds out A g'lldcs ill
classes. lloth of these aims are dcsi 'ablc
but nevertheless nciihcr one, in itself, is
sufficient. The only solution is to follow a
balanccd dicl of study and activiiics with
enough fun from worthwhile plcasul'cs so
that yoll 'nll truly bc cilllcd an illlclligclll
man or \vomnn.

Ari tcachcl's, all lllc l'i'lvoliiics and cx~
pcllsivc accool'rclncnis of plcasurc will uol
bc ours, but \vc can cilioy those lllal urc
more real, and, ill lllc long run, more valu-
able.

So, although wc may not be liullons, let
us at lca:-<.l bc gcllilc folk who will be clll
lurcd, happy, and iolcl'cslcd
inlcrcslillg.

STATE COLLEGE NEWS,

 

“Life is Very Different ”

Commentatater

(THE COMMENTSTATE’R is given the widest
latitude as author of this column, though his view-
points do not necessarily always reflect those of the
STATE COLLEGE Nllws.)

“The time has come," the walrus said, “to talk of
many things," and, after a long vacation, that is just
how we feel about it. Of course. We wouldn’t be an
honest—to-goodness first Commentstaler if we didn't
devote our space to the freshmen. Have you met the
frosh? We'Ve been looking over the situation in the
Boulevard. the Annex, and the rotunda, and We think
they're pretty much on the all right side.

The results of the new personal interview system
of admission are self-evident. We may not have as
many State scholarship holders or senior valedictorians
(this is, of course, conjectural, because we haven't

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

been snooping ill the dean's office), but We did find
an unusually personable and responsive group. Ac-
cording to all reports, they were lucky to be admitted
to State but it is our opinion that We arc Just as for—
tunate. The hard-working NHWH staff and your glad-
to-be~back-in—the-harness Commcntstatcr
you, '42, 4: t‘ w i= «

welcome

“Contrary to the announcement ill the State

College NeWs" directly above, We do agree, at least ill -

part, with Mr. O‘Hora‘s editorial policy, and We care
to reflect it in one instance. Freshmen, we refer you
to paragraph two of this week's editorial. Seriously
We. can't stress it enough. We want you interested ll
college activities, but when you graduate land 1'01 .'
years do pass quickly—ask any sclli()l‘.), we don’t .vant
,vou to say. "Oh was there anything below R'lbln
Street?" We sincerely hope that you will look beyond
the walls of State college and make Albany your home.
,y. it! l< 4‘ i!

It did our serious senior hclll'ts good to hear of
tile stunt that the faculty women put on at freshman
calllp. As a matter of fact, the faculty were very
llluch in evidence at both camps and We were lllorc
than glad. The freshmen had a wonderful opportunity
to meet the people we upperclassmcn count as good
friends. We hope that opportunity will not be lost.

We have the Wllole thing worked out lll true dcductive ,
The sooner you get to know lllc faculty, {

reasoning.
the longer you will know them; tllc longer you know
them, the better you will know them, and the better
you know them, the better person you will be. There—
fore, it follow, you should get to know tllclll soon.
Will you?

Personal
Viewpoints

(EGO is given the widest lati-
tude as author of this column,
though his viewpoints do not
necessarily always reflect those
of the STATE Common News.)

My, oh me, the summer‘s o'er
and your Egomaniac is back to
quibble over things and stuff.
Looking over the field with a
cursory glance, we find:

’l‘liE COMMONS — “The old
order changeth . .  and giveth
way to a smaller but —— Well,
smaller Commons. The fresh
didn't notice anything, but the
upperclasslnen walked right illto
a blank wall, so as to speak. We
don't think the loss of room will
be much of a problem, bllt where
will the balcony loungers and
stair-sitters hang out now?

Incidentally while We're in the
Commons, how about a time-
piece for that establishment of
leisure. Its llabitucs would then
be relieved of the necessity of
chasing froln table to tablc ill
search of the hour.

SENIORHAF‘or the benefit of
the freshmen We mcall those
somber, scrious—visagcd indivi-
duals who arc worrying Illcir
way through tllc halls. 'f‘hc sull-
wnl'ls of ‘39 have already llii lllc
pl'actiCc leaching line and are
preparing for Tuesday‘s zero
hour. Why lllc sad faces? it's
full.

M"l'lVl'l‘llCS DAY  You
i'rcshlncn can do yourselves a
, lot of good tomorrow. Get down

to the Commons and sign up for

whatever you like most. A word
to the wise —- concentration of
energy on the one or two things
you like host may be more ad-
] vaningcous than gcllcrai partici-

still wants them to fight darn hard.

The usually present sophomore-
junlor vs. freshman softball game,
was concluded by a torrential dribble
of rain upon the heads of both sides
—even wetting the straining fresh-
men. A new event ln the camp
program fell into being in the wee,
small hours of the morning when the
beginnings of class organization
were felt for the first time so early
in the year by the usually invincible
(at least in Freshman Camp) sopho-
llllores. Intelligence, freshmen, is
what you're credited with, but using
lit so early is not quite cricket, you
know!

So—the fl'osh were inducted into
their first year at State. On Fri-
day, they were doing their first
)mixing with the sports minded of
istatc. On Saturday they did
everything but go swimming. On
Sunday morning they (lid things so
well as to be on top. What about
ii, sophs?

M. A. A. Apiioinis V
Ryan to Direct
Publicity Bureau

Recently Organized Group
To Publicize Athletics
Of State College

William Ryan, '39, Student Rep-
resentative of M. A, A. Council, has
been named director of the newly
organized M. A. A. Press Bureau
which will act as the official pub-
licity agent for all varsity and intra-
mural sports and all other activities
which fall under the Jurisdiction of
the Men's Council.

Tile inscigation of this publicity
organization is but another example
of the attempt being made by Presi-
dent Duke Hershkowitz and the
Men's Council to give lo the men of
State a bigger and better athletic
program.

The Press Bureau will function for
tile ensuing year, alld, if after this
trial pcriod it has proved its worth,
it will be continued under the super-
vision of the M. A. A. Council.

Ryan, who was Sports Editor of
lllc lews, last y ‘ar, has announced
that approximately fiftccn men have
been llallled to positions on the
Bureau. According to the director,
lllc Press Bureau will contact all
schools with Whom State will meet
ill aihlctic rivalry and secure ill-
i‘ormalion from those schools con-
,ccl'llillg their schedules, the varsity
‘mcll returning, the prollllsillg soph—
omore. llnllcrinl, alld their expecta-
tions for the coming season.

Also, the Bureau will act as State
College's official sports correspond-
cnt for all lleWspapers in the Capital
District. It will further contact tne
home town papers of the varsity
squad and offer publicity which, it
is hoped, will stimulate interest ill
tlle home town boy and his ahna
mater as well.

Upon the suggestion of Duke
Hershkowitz, president of M. A. A.,
Ryan said that a scrap book contain-
ing all the athletic activities of the
men of State will be maintained by
the Bureau.

The men who have already been
named to positions on the Bureau
are: Jimmy Quinn, Len Freeman,
Walt Simmons, Joe McKeon, Frank
Rickmnll, Frank Augustine, Jimmy
Maloney, John Murray, Joe
Schwartz, John Gardephe, Arnold
Ellcrhl, Hyman Meltz, Gadlin Bod-
llcr. Cill‘l Murotto, and Delfio Man-
