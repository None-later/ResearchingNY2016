World Famed Choral Group
Visits State College
For Third Time

CONCERT IN PAGE HALL
Varied Proggmjo Consist
of Russian Folk Music,
Religious Songs

The first in this year’s series of
Music council presentations will
bring the world famed Don Cossacks
to Page hall, Monday night at 8:30
o’clock, for the first time since 1935.
The chorus will be under the direc-
tion of Serge Jaroff, noted conductor
of this choral group,

The Don Cossacks, who recently
celebrated their fifteenth anniver-
sary, hold the record of having sung
more consecutive concerts and ap-
peared in more cities than any other
choral organization in the world.
The chorus has given more than
3750 concerts in every country of
Europe and the other continents.

Colorful Folk Songs

They offer a program of colorful
folk songs of a former Russia. Three
‘groups of songs are included: church
music, the haunting Russian folk
songs, and the final group of stirring
Cossack soldier songs which are ac-
companied by shrill 'alls, barbaric
lshonts, and frenzied dancing. They
lhuve a startlingly beautiful dramatic
‘cfl'cct, achieved by their own un-
canny use of" voice.

The Don Cossacks- are the last
reminants of the "Eleventh Lost
"I‘ribc" which was cxtin;1,uishcd over-
night, during the World War. The
Cossacks have always been a spiritcd,
fiery people, and the Don Cossacks
