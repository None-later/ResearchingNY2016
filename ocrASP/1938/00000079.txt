Rushing Aspirin

“When the burly Illlrly'-. llonc.‘
When the hul'ly burly of first semester
exams is over, the sorority girls start the
holacaust of formal rushing. After tWo
weeks of c‘amming alld jittery nerves, the
‘sisters’ put on their best company smiles
and attempt to be nice to the freshman
women. The greenics have, themselves,
,‘iust completed the most trying interlude
of their first semester. These two groups
combine and both expect to make wise
choices. We do not feel that this 'an be
true under those trying conditions.

Silllkc-«pcn rc.

One of the reasons for the sad work
of some sorority girls on these examinations
is that they have spent too much time or-
ganizing and worrying about these formal
functions. We believe that there are two
solutions to the problem. The first—post—
pone these functions two weeks or so. The
sccond and, We feel, the bcst rule would bc
to hold the rush pal-tics tllc weekend be-
fore 'l‘hanksgivinl,r recess. lt‘l'iday, Satur-
day, and Sunday would be the ideal days,
will the next week a silent period. This
would allow tllc t'rcshmcll to go home and
chat with their family about the sorority
situation.

'l‘llcn tllti'i‘t.‘ would bc no dangcr of any-
onc’s seriously slig‘llting‘ studics at a crucial
time. The minds of all couccl'ncd would be
clear and everyone would bc ablc to choose
more wiscly.

At that time the women should know
each other well enough to dccidc on this
serious question. it Would enable the
sorority girls to concentrate on otllcr sub-
,jccts beside rushing and would allow the
freshmen to quit. worrying.

We offer this as a suggestion for inter-
sorority council to consider seriously.
There may be better solutions to the evil,
but the present system is an evil and should
be corrected. We hate to see our friends
go slowly insane from tllc strain again this
year.

Early ill the semester, a council of war was con-
ducted in the Activities office by the heads of the
various activities quartered there. Don‘t get cxcitcd!
We'vc bccn doing that for years! This year, as usual,
we dccidcd to close (and lock) the door to the gen-
cl‘tll public so that the staff: and councils could do
some serious and unhampcrcd work there. Well.
We really have bccn quite successful. Now only those
people who have kcys, labout tllil'ty-fivci, their in-
timate friends, sorority sisters, fraternity brothers,
tllc visiting alums, and nearest relatives can come in.
It‘s very exclusive!

We can‘t help it, 'though. There are too many activi-
ties ccntcrcd there. Did you realize that at least
