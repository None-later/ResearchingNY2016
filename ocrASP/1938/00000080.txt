ing mention of various exhibitions
that had been arranged to instruct
students on this subject.

Included on the program was a
competition with prizes for the best
collections. College students who
were working their way through col-
lege won these awards.

Students who have some inter-
esting books may have an oppor—
tunity to display them in the library.
All interested are urged to contact
Miss Helen Joncs.

During the summer months the
stacks of the college library were
extended seventeen feet by parti-
tioning off a sizable portion of the
Commons, This action was prompted
by an ever increasing demand for
more space for the library.

joyed the fame of their deed, gener-

mouse boarding the Lion in his
den. Comment filled the air, and
many students wanted to give him
some. One girl asked coyiy, “Can
