Buy American Bally/100

linrmony. libernl intercourse with all nations nre rec-um-
mcmletl by policy. Immunity, nml Interest. Washington.

We admit that this nation of ours is ad-
crazy, but the silliest, most backward
scheme that has ever hit us is this ‘Buy
American—Buy Local’ campaign.

One of the reasons that the late crisis
in Europe did not turn into a war was that
the nations and their people realized the
economic impossibilities of such a move. At
the present time economic connections
make every nation interdependent upon the
others, and war means economic disaster.
And yet this country has the idea that the
‘ iuy American' slogan is perfect and feas-
ible. First We Buy American; then, buy
city, then, buy street—finally we’ll be down
to feudalism and going against all the his-
tory of the last one hundred and fifty years.

The hope of the world lies in world wide
co-operation and this is not enhanced by
the pitting of one community against an-
other, or one avenue against a street.

The good feature of this plan is the fact
that it may stimulate buying, but it should
be just ‘Buy’! What difference does it
make whether you buy Albany or buy Au-
burnor buy Japan?

" ,Weshould work towards a system that
would-allow all nations to trade together
peacefully and, .in so doing, exchange cul-
tural values and backgrounds. Even Jolt,
ferson, gmat isolationistihathe was, still
said, “trade and commerce with all no-
tions'."'”'“ " ' I

Tremendous Trivia

 

 

Commentstater

(THE COMMENTSTATER is given the widest
latitude as author of this column. though his view-
points do not necessarily always reflect those of the
STATE Contact: News.)

The scene is the tiny Unitarian chapel across the
street from college. Above the hush of the expectant
audience, there is the singing melody of a violin. The
throbbing organ music ushers in the procession of stu-
dents. The “stage” is lit only by candles, and the
intensity of the participants becomes almost a com-
municable sensation. Thus might read the stage
direction for the Candlelight Service sponsored by
the Student Christian association this week. Unusual?
Yes. Rigid? No. Sincere? Deﬁnitely.

The service was admirable in every sense. There
was a setting of quiet dignity; there was appropriate
music; there was comprehensible symbolism, and best
of all, State college students responded to it in a way
that is comparable only to their reception of the phil-
harmonic orchestra’s program last year. It was so
completely different from any other organized activ-
ity—women and men (for the ﬁrst time) participating
in unpretentious worship.

It lasted but twenty minutes, this program that was
so capably directed by Janet Gurney and Mary Miller,
Not long after it. was over, books were reopened in the
library, and the work of the evening was resumed.
Yet We have a feeling that we who attended the service
are aware that We can live With just a little more
radiance for having attended it.

Play of the Week:
Sauce for Sophisticates

Jane Cowl came to town on The Road to Rome.
A play that is for the sophisticates and those of a
gentler nature might find it hard to digest.

The Road to Rome, written by Robert Sherwood,
restates the glory that was Rome, intimating at the
same time that Hannibal was a conqueror with a soul.
The play opens in the home of FabIUs Maximus, newly
declared dictator. Fablus is expounding his greatness
to his wife, Ametius, who SOWS the seed of thought in
his mind that a conference with Hannibal, just ar-
rived at the walls of Rome, might save the city. She
leaves that night, ostensibly for her mother's home
outside Rome, but is curiously sidetracked to Hannibal's
camp. She is brought before the general as a spy, and
is condemned to instant death. She gains a short, but
profitable, reprieve through a ready command of words
and a great understanding of human nature. Han-
nibal, on the morrow, having become attached to the
lady, desires her company back to Carthage, after he
finishes off Rome. She, on the other hand, wishes him
to leave Rome undcstroycd, [with the understanding
that Rome would destroy itselfl, leave his wars, leave
her, and truly come to know the “human equation"
which she tried to teach him. Fabius Maximus ar-
rives under a flag of truce, asking Hannibal to have
mercy on Rome. Hannibal, a great man, promises to
spare Rome, wishes Fablus Maximum the best of
everything, bids Ametlus farewell, and goes off with
his army and his elephants.

The historical accuracy of the play is doubtful. ln
deviating from the true road left by the march of
time, Sherwood justifies himself by creating a prim-
rose path Lhat is good entertainment. There seems to
be a bit of satire involved concerning the longwindcd
senators, the “boys at the front." and the frequent
reference to dictators——not to mention the peace parley.
The anachronlsm in such phrases as "sweetless Sat-
urday," and in the Brooklyn accent. used by the sol-
diers, was curious. But didn't Shakespeare mention
the striking of the clock in Julius Caesar?

The play, whateVer its faults. did how: some poig-
nant moments, and a fair share of comedy. The superb
versatlon, though often ribald. was clever. The superb
dramatic ability of Jane Cowl, and a good supporting
cast, sustainedthe interest of the audience from be—
ginning to endpwith the exception of a fewiscenes that
Were slow i‘n’ls't'a‘rtlng. The perfect smoothness With’

Personal
Viewpoints

(EGO is given the widest lati-
tude as author of this column,
though his viewpoints do not
necessarily always reflect those
of the STATE COLLEGE News.)

State’s social season having
gotten under way, We notice that
an ever recurring problem is—
to coin a phrase —— recurring.
We mean this business of calling
up a faculty member or campus
housemother some two or three
hours before an affair, in order
to ask them to chaperone It.

Won’t you lads and lassies
ever see the spot you put them
on? How would some of you
girls feel for instance if you
were asked to a dance only a
couple of hours in advance?
Chaperones feel the same. It’s
embarrassing. They don’t know
but what they are being asked
because someone refused, or
that it’s a last-minute effort to
be polite by remembering them.

And, speaking of being polite,
even Emily Post suggests suffici-
ent notice, as regards an invita-
tion, that the invited party may
plan on attending, or, if they
can’t, send regrets, thus leaving
the arrangements committee
with plenty of time to see about
getting somebody else.

So let's try to be ladies and
gentlemen about this, and, for
goodness sake, once you get
chaperones, don’t think your job
is ﬁnished. Too many of us
consider them a necessary evil.
We say to that—Phooey!

It takes about two or three
minutes to greet them as you ar-
rive, and as for entertaining
them during the evening—well,
they’re there for a good time
too, and sitting down to dry dis-
cussion is just as dry to them
as it is to you. Then Why do it?

We just thought we’d ask. It
makes us mad.

W. A. A. Will Sponsor First Weekend

Cross Country  
PM! Meet

 

Still engaged in gradual Warm-up
preparatory to the impending time
trials, the cross country squad this
week swung into an extended prac-
tice course covering an approximate
three miles.

Starting in Washington park's
main path, the new route leads the
barriers on to Madison avenue. From
there they trot to Morton avenue
and on into Lincoln park, Where they
round the swimming pool before
commencing the return grind past
Hackett into Washington park. A
swing around the lake into the home
stretch completes the course.

Wilczynski feels that many of the
boys are already capable of full
speed trotting. but advocates the
continuance of slow workouts as a
safety measure. .
