‘ Chastened Cubs Rest in Pieces;

 

 

Pitchers and Fish Are Victims

by Joe Boelcy {

Last Wednesday the modern ver-
sion of Custer’s Massacre began at
Wrigley Field in Chicago. Baseball
bugs all over the country tore about
with excitement glaring in their
eyes. Even in State college the sup-
porters of the New York Yanks
snarled at the timid souls who cast
a feeble ballot in the direction of
Chicago. The feeble ballots went
to Chicago by way of Cape Horn
because the Cubs were clipped in
four straight games. International
laws applying to the bombing of
neutrals should have been invoked
against the Yanks. The Cubs were
not participants in the baseball wars.

People who hadn’t known the
score for years shouted the score
by innings. The Physics department
had more people in room 250 in two
days than they have graduated in
twenty years. The people who still
have faith in miracles bet on Chl-
cago—at leasc to win one game.
These unfortunates sat daily amid
a pile of torn papers and ﬁnger-
nails.

“Crude!” said society.

“Nutsl” said the unfortunates as
the Yanks blasted line drives all
over the countryside.

The Cub hurlers who had the
misfortune to face the Yanks as
starters Were Lee, Dean, and Bryant,
The Cub hurlers who had the mis-
fortune to face the Yanks in that
capacity or any other capacity were
a bunch of guys named Joe. Lee
did OK. in the first battle but he
surprised the world when he Showed
his face for the fourth game. Dlz
Dean dragged his dead arm to the
mound and dead-armed the Yanks
into submission for seven innings.
However, the powerhouse ﬁnally ex—
ploded all over him when Crosetti
and DiMaggio teed off and cloutcd
the ball into Lake Michigan. Cro-
setti's drive stunned a swordﬁsh just

  

b

 

 

off the coast of Canada. This was
given to Dean and the Cubs in
memory of the series of '38. The
Cubs didn’t want to remember it.
As the Cubs crawled on the field
for the third game they were very
unhappy. Bryant was the most dis-
illusioned because he had to duck
the line drives from Yankee bats.
He attempted to take the ﬁeld in a
suit of armor—he would have car-
ried it off the ﬁeld in four innings.
He got about $4,000 for that session;
they get less than that in a carnival
dodging balls for a lifetime. The
Cubs invaded the Old Men’s Home to
dig up French and Russell who were
too old to care. In the meanwhile,
Hack and Marty were the only Cubs
who remained awake. A siren was
blown between rounds to rouse the
Cubs to a mild heat. The Yanks
reclined in feather beds between in-
nings to rest after tearing around
the bases. The plate. dented by
Yankee runners, was donated to

P. K. Wrigley who will use his next'

year‘s production to ﬁll in the holes.
It's all over now. The Cubs re—

turned home in mourning; the

Yanks aren't at all surprised.

Shorthand, Typing Experts

to Demonstrate Skill
at Today’s Show

With two days remaining in which

to examine the $25,000 worth of busi

ness machines now on display in the
commons ol‘ Hawlcy hall, the Com-

merce club is planning many specla

features to “wind up” their busi-

ness machines exhibition.

The exhibition, which opened yes-
terday at 9:00 o’clock, will continue

through
o'clock.

The special demonstrations slatcc
for today include speed shorthanc

writing by Charles E. Zoubcck, cer-
tiﬁed shorthand reporter, who will
write at the rate of two hundred
words per minute with chalk. Zou-,

beck will appear at 12:00 o’clock

and again at 3:00 o'clock. Chester

pion, will follow Zoubcck at 3:15

Marriage Commission
Plans Novel Discussion

Would you like to discuss so
modern a subject as Marriage
Education in a real old fash-
ioned bull session? If so, you
need only drop around to the
lounge at 3:30 o’clock Monday.
All seniors, juniors and sopho-
mores are invited to attend.

Carolyn Mattice and Gordon
Tabner, seniors, will start the
matrimonial ball rolling but from
then on. you’re on your own.
- Raise questions of your own,
answer those of your friends,
shut up like a clam or just listen
1 hard. Do anything you wish but
be sure to come. That's right,
there will be no faculty mem-
bers present.

The ulterior motive behind this
incin—
bers of the marriage commis-
1 mission, having no precedents
l to follow, are “up a tree” as to
just how a course of this kind
should be planned. They ex-
pect to secure valuable informa-
tion from this discussion that
w will assist them in planning
future programs.

Historical Background of State’s Fall Event

and Colgate Football Game

But wait, that‘s only the be-
ginning of big tilncs at State.
Moving up in the Campus Day
field we find the State college
gridiron stars kicking the ball
to—to——catch me while this
touch football supporter falnts—
Colgate. What a day that must
have been for ye oldsters.

Howavcr due to the lack of
men—it's an age old problem——
football was replaced by a circus
given by the entire student body.
(Now, now, Statesman, no cracks
about State college freaks.) Still
later field ball replaced football
and G.A.A. sold lollypops in the
grandstand while the spectators
cheered louder than ever. What
suckerslll All kidding aside
though, here’s something worth
notice. Campus Day became so
popular and the attendance so
overwhelming that the public
was invited to merely witness the
athletic events, coronation and
stunts. All students—especially
the males—who planned to at—
tend the dance following the
main events were to secure ad-
mission tickets preceding the big
date. (Ed. note—Sort of a good
idea don't you think—or don’t
you.)
