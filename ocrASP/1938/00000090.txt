Pooey to Proctoring

“So are they all, all honorable nien—" .N'Iialu-speure.

Today we took a test in a department
whose members previously had given us
the impression that they trusted us, and

although the rooms were proctored there

 

was no tense air because of the excess care—
t‘ulness of this watching. llut today we
were not treated as honest people, but
'athe ' as miscreants oi" the worst and bolti-
est type. The group was sepa 'ated into two
rooms and seated so far apart that a tele-
scope was necessary to even recognize your
neighbor. ’l‘hen our proctor told us to
watch our own papers or have them taltcn
i'rotn us. This system was inaugurated in
a department which previously had allowed
a period ol' relaxation in the middle oi' the
examination. And we believe there was as
little or less cl’icating' under this system than
there was in any other department ot' the

school. 'l'ht-ro \\.‘t~ -.oino under the old  ‘-
biit icli \vc
l'airly and tht-rei'orc played l'ai‘rly'.

\Vc tlt) ttoi believe that State t'tillt't.’,'t‘
students are iltlevcs or cheats bill this is
what the heavily proctored test
its ol' being. We believi- lllt‘l’t‘ will be more
attempts to cheat, and more ingenious
methods used to cheat in a cai'ci‘tilly
guarded tc:~l than in you
trusted.

l.;lltlt‘l' the honor" system proposed last
year We would substitute tor the, proctor
system a spy system, one which woitld cause
you to “tattle” on your who
might cheat. We would never sign such
a pledge because we would railicr have

A Senior Views Campus Day

 

Commentstater

(TI/E C(hllilllt’N’I'S'I‘A’I'ER is girrii the
latitude as author of this column. though his t‘lt‘lli-
points do not necessarily alit‘ags riflcel those of the
STATE Coi.i.i-:iii-: Ni-iwsJ

Tomorrow is Campus day—one of our oldest and
finest; traditional days, second only to Moving-up day.
Tomorrow all the pageantry of beauty, costume,
talent and humor of State college will be ptit on for
an evening's entertainment—ii you want it so. It can
very easily be an empty procession and a dismal fail-
ure, or it can be a manifestation 0f the best spirit
and effort of all the student. body. What do We mean?
Merely this—

From the opening bars of “Pomp and Circum-
stance" to the mad dash to dormitory or group house
at the midnight hour «and we do hope that Campus
day won't turn into it Campuscd day), make the spirit
of the evening a part of yoti. Freshmen have before
them the thrill of the app ’ai'ancc of the Queen they
helped to choose; upperclassincn may view for the
first time the talents of the freshmen as they are
shown for the first time in the stunts, and guests have
an opportunity to see State college having a good time.

So you think you know who is Campus Queen?
Well, We have a couple of bets on it. too, but We will
be craning our necks just as hard as you when the
door from Richardson into Page opens and the lucky
girl of the senior quintet steps slowly out. thn the
music begins, We will be standing. not because we be-
lieve in the "divine right of lciiigs"»—or queenswbc—
cause he i'ant to show our respect for the girl who
has been chosen as oitr queen tor the evening, and for
her attendants

However, the procession is what we might 'all a
climatic prelude, because there is more to come. We
can't promise you anything about the stunts. States-
inan—likc, We‘ve been snooping around, but all we
could discover was the ('osttnnc plans for the Senior
stunt and they arc tremendous. We are keeping our

Comes tomorrow night, and

ception will be followed, We
mean about keeping State's at"-

Maybe Myskania won't have to
be bouncers for the evening. and
we might get a little dancing
into otir programs. So much
for that!

Breaking a long
name bands. —— bands like
Claude Hopkins and Bunny
Bcrigan—— the seniors succumb
to that disease peculiar to
seniors, tossing Hop with an un-
known musical aggregation. We.
personally, have never heard of
Ray Kcating, but We won't pass
any judgment on him till We, do.
He might prove to be good. if
we remember correctly. no one
had heard so much about. Joey
Hayines last year, biit he proved
to be a lot better than his ad—
vci'tising.

Those who have heard Kcating'
say he‘s all right; so Ego is going
home to sit by his radio, and
listen to station WOR in the
hope of hearing him,

But don‘t get us wrong.

Advanced drainaiics can look for—

ward to an auspicious year if their
first presentations are any indica-
tion of what is to come. The two
oil‘erings. while not hits in the ordi-
nary sense of the word, Were thor-
oughly adequate. The one outstand-
ing feature of the night was. to this
reviewer. the technical perfection 0f
the plays. A revolver, of course, will
fall apart at the most uni’orunate
moments, but that doesn‘t detract
li'om the general technical improve-
incnt.
I It did seem that the interval be—
tween plays might be shortened cori-
sidcrably, but we’ll chalk that up to
thc inexperience oi' the stage crew.
The new amber lights, replacing
those glaring fonts ot' the past, Were
.a ll'l'ill i'or these eyes. Milkein ac-
tually looked realistic. rather than
wnshcd otit.

'i‘he iirst play. Miss Wilson's pro-
duction, was a well-acted and well—
dirccicd bit of diversion. Miss Dc-
‘Cotis held her character, with but,
a few lapses, through the gamut ot
emotion she was required to ex-
press iroin the imperious, cold
widow, to [lie nnstrung matron who
linds in-rseli‘ Ill love.

Mr. Weiss. starting out a bit iin—
.siirc of himself, \'as too harsh in
lthc curly moments oi the play. but
trose to the occasion to turn in a
‘convincing performance. Mr. Wiihcv
was .i thoroughly i'rightcncd scrv~
ant.

Miss Brown‘s play gave us the act-
1111! giin oi the evening. Mr. lSo—
cosia‘s portrayal oi' the blind
i',l';llltllitlltt‘l' “as lttti\'lll,L', and Ho,”
