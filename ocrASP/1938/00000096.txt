Mainly Visionary

We have been told that we are
attempting a rather vain thing in
our attempts to get some interest
behind the idea of football at State.

People have been very kind, in
fact. All they’ve said is that it Just
wouldn't be practical—and compli-
mented us on being very noble about
wasting our time.

The idea of nobility has always
appealed to us. Blue blood in our
veins! Prince of day dreamers, duke
of fantasy—all noble titles, these.

Mainly Historical

Once upon a time We described the
history-making football squad which
existed in the golden era. That story
has been handed down from sports
editor to sports editor. But was our
face red when, on thumbing through
some way back issues of the News,
we saw headlines blaring out about
State’s eleven.

In the fifth annual issue of the
News, on November 11, 1920, there
appeared a story of the great show—
ing of intramural football squads in
that, the second year of its play here
since 1917, and a conﬁdent outlook
toward Coach Snavely's scheduling
of our ﬁrst intercollegiate struggle
on November 20, 1920.

Nothing materialized from the op-
timism—not even a report in the
News.

The next mention of the grunt
and groan grind came out in a blare.
Right square in the middle of the
September 28, 1922 issue, there ap-
peared a half column announcement
of State's five-game intercollegiate
gridiron meets for the season.

Record: 1 postponed game; 3
defeats; 1 win; the glory of football.

The 1923-24 issue of the News is
missing. I

On October 3. 1924, a six-game ill-
tercollcgiate schedule was an-
nounced. Opponents included were
the frosh of Colgate. R.P.I., and
Union, and the regulars of Worces-
ter Tech, Manhattan college, and

 

 

 

 

Springfield.

Record: 1 postponed game; 4 dc-
feats; 1 win; closer scores; glory
still.

The 1924 issue contains the last
mention of scheduled games. Foot-
ball. which the optomlstic sports

 

editor of '20 classified as the oldest
of sports, once again went back to
the mere fancies of princes of the
realm.
Mainly Practical

The other night We surveyed the
royal crackling of the fired logs in
0111- mansionic domicile and we were
again bitten by the ghosts of pre—
ceding royalty.

Which led to our
records.

Classes Out For Blood
In Pushball Struggle

Sampsonian and Herculean
strengths will be pitted against
each other Campus day in a
pushball contest which initiates
the rivalry betWeen the classes
of ’41 and ’42. The sophomores
will attempt to We up to their
reputation, whatever it is, and
the freshmen will try to live up
to theirs. It looks like a whale
of a battle.

The teams will be evenly
matched with the frosh having
the better man power but the
sophs having the confidence. At
freshman camp, the yearlings
organized and for a time actu-
ally resisted the outnumbered
class of '41. This was an un-
precedented action. Never in
State's history had a group of
green recruits displayed such
resistance at camp. ’41 seeks re-
venge! Only a win in pushball
can appease that “victor-
starved" appetite.

So it's revenge on one side
and reputation on the other.
Who will win? Well, anything
can and will happen. It will be
a pip of a fight; of that you
can be sure.

Freshmen Start
Season Practice

Freshman practice has opened
the basketball season at State. The
frosh hopefuls have been at it now
for a week. endeavoring to get in
shape for the season’s opener. About
twenty-five freshmen reported for
the squad; hOWever, the list has been
cut down to sixteen men who Will
represent the class of ’42 and State
in the coming campaign.

Practice consists in a great deal
of running to prepare for the fast
game that is played without the
center tap. They have been running
around throwing the ball until the
sweat poured from their manly
brows. The air has been ﬁlled with
basketballs and finally the boys
threw sweat balls when they reached
a sizeable proportion.

The following have survived the
first cut: Bulmer, Brauner, Dickson,
Graves Griffin. Hilton, Johnson,
Jordon: Kaufman, Lally. Larko, Leh-
man, Merritt, Ray, Scott and R.
Seifert.

Seriously, the frosh look very
good. They have plenty of atti-
tude and have come up with some
very fine ball handlers. It is ob-
vious, too, that they do haVe some
experienced players on the team—a
thing that past fresh teams have
sadly lacked. They should certain-
ly break precedent and Win a fair
share of their games. Coach
Hershkowitz looks for a fine season
——hc certainly should have one.

All in all, the freshman class
should have an otitflt worthy of the
name basketball team."

State Supports
Touch Football

K. D. R. and College House
Lead in Intramural
Sports Contest

 

 

The men of State are certainly
supporting this year’s football pro-
gram, They like the way it is being
conducted a ' seem to appreciate
the greater in...“ s at their dis-
posal. The intramu. ‘ council should
be commended ‘or t.ll' work in
creating this interest
Entering into the fourth week of
touch football, the nine teams rep-
resenting the diﬁerent fraternal fac-
tions and group houses are really
battling to come out on top. The
consensus of opinion among those
rabid followers of the sport as to
the power and ability of the various
clubs is as follows: Kappa Delta
Rho, College house, Albanians,
Commuters, Potter club, Sigma
Lambda Sigma, Kappa Beta, Ava-
lon-Spencer, and Robin hall.
Talk about those Pittsburgh Pan-
thers, come out and watch that po-
tent array of KDR's go to town.
They're big, ﬂashy, and deceptive.
They work together like a machine
and it looks like they’ll march
through the opposition without a
defeat. The kicking of Fairbanks,
defensive ability of Bull, and the
running of Brophy are the triple
threats of the KDR sextette.
College house ranks second and
so far is undefeated. They are fast
and have great scoring pOWers. They
are especially efficient on the de-
fense with Hershkowitz as the main-
stay. Torrens is probably the fast-
est man on the squad and it‘s just
too bad if he gets into the open.
The Albanians rank next in line.
They held KDR to a tie and lack
only better co-ordination. They're
going to be tough to beat. Barrett
and Schmitz are the spearheads of
their attack.
The Commuters elevated them-
selves a notch when they repulsed
Potter club last week. Doran is a
fine open field runner and accounts
for plenty of touchdowns while
Saddlemire is a very effective blocker
who spills the opposition at will,
Potter club ranks in the mid-spot
but is improving with every game.
They are poorly organized and need
to brush up on their plays. Frament
can nab that pigskin from rigiit
under the very noses of the opposi-
tion. He is a poworful factor in
Potter's offensive attack.
Sigma Lambda Sigma is shaping
up as an increasingly strong con-
tender as the season progresses. Bill
Thomas, that diminutive halfback.
is the man to watch. He is agile
and has a tendency to reel off huge
gains against the opposition. Hilde-
brandt is a heady player and is death
at breaking up plays.
Avalon—Spencer has a small out-
fit but a fast one. Possibly they may
upset the "dope." Halter, Gcrdts,
and Sprowls work together smoothly
to form an effective scoring unit.
Robin hall is the dark horse in the
race. They haven't shown much as
yet but you never can tell.

ments haVe been extremely rapid of

Fall Season

From
Badminton
To Worse

 

I I
The season‘s activities seem to
be more or less at a standstill, with
all sports functioning smoothly. The
key-note for these few Weeks is
“preparation for the future.”
The badminton and tennis tour-
naments are progressing in the
usual turtle-like fashion of all
tournaments.——Du Rocher and Mil-
ler have reached the third round
of the tennis matches while Baird,
Doyle, Chase, Hunt and Harvey are
lobbing it out in round two. The
badminton tournament fares not so
swell—only Riaiii, Haushalter, Rob-
inson, MacLean and Gauthier have
reached the second round. Maybe
that’s What comes of trying to sys-
tematize a recreational sport—par-
ticularly one which was introduced
into the program for purely recrea-
tional purposes. ,
The hockey aggregation had a
thorough workout Tuesday. The
State and Milne teams had a tough
hour-and-a-haif’ practice session
that afternoon under hockey-expert
Mrs. Barry. Passing difficulties wore
ironed out and formation lags cor—
rected. Reason for all this enthusi-
asin on the part of hockey players?
The hockey conference at Emma
Willard tomorrow. The conference
is sponsored by the Mohawk Hockey
cltib. Miss Margaret Hitchcock, iii-
structor of physical education at
State and president of the club, was
instrumental in arranging the con-
ference. Other delegations to the
meet will represent Skidmore and
Russell Sage. The twelve-member
squad from State will spend the
morning practicing under the
watchful eyes of hockey officials, and
will compete on color teams in the
afternoon.
“LOOKING AHEAD" DEPART-
MENT. Be sure to include A. A.'s
"Final Fail Fling" in your sched-
ure of events to come. This affair
has been planned to take the place
of a day of indoor games. All fling—
ing will be done at Camp Johnston
on the weekend of November 11-13.

For those who cannot spend the
whole Weekend at camp, may we
recommend Saturday. November 12.
as the high spot of a big Weekend?
Official A. A. winter season hand-
books wili also be issued at that
date.

Since winter season begins Nov-
ember lti, winter sports are to coin
a phrase—looming large on the as-
sociation's horizon. Captains have
already been selected for basketball
and the snow sports. Ginny Mitchell,
assisted by Marion Kingsley itll(l
Madeline Beers will coach the bus-
kctccrs. Fran Rluni will be gcncral
chairman of snow sports, with cap-
tains Fran Wood. Milly Pangburn
and Helen lnishcr in charge, rcspcc-
lively, of tobogganiiig skiing and

tion. This also will mark the fifth
trotting between the two teams.
State has engaged Delhi every sca-
son sillCC cross country was initi-
ated as l1 varsity sport here in 1934.
in their first rtin in 1934, the
Aggics downed an inexperienced ag-
gregation of purple and gold liar—
riei's 26—29. After another defeat at
the hands of“ Delhi in 1935. the Feds
came back the following season to
hand the Aggies a trimming to the
tune of 26-29. Lust fall, it will be
recalled. Delhi emerged the victor of
a closely run contest.

Veteran members of the present
team who saw service. in the 1936
run at Delhi recall the course there
as the most difficult they have ever
encountered, chiefly because of its
hilly character.

Two sets of time trials were re-
quired for the selection of the seven
men who will compose this y ‘ai's
varsity and who will venture their
trotting abilities against Delhi to-
morrow. The 1938 team, culled from
the roster of aspirants by these test
runs includes Tony Wilczynski. cap-
tain and manager of the squad.
Johnny Neuhs. and Walt Russ, sen-
ioi's. Stove Sziiwlowski and Louis

S. C. A. Will Have

Guest Speaker
At Next Meeting

Miss Rose Terlin Will Give
Talk on World S. C. A.
Tuesday at 3:30

There will be a general meeting
of the Student Christian association
on Tuesday at 3:30 o’clock in the
Lounge of Richardson hall. Miss
Rose Terlin of New York will be
the guest speaker. She will talk
on the World Student Christian
federation of which the State Col-
lege S. C. A. is a part.

Miss Terlin, who is keenly aware
of student problems, has just re-
turned from a conference abroad
where she met with student rep-
resentatives from many countries.

Also at this meeting there will
be special music and folksongs.

Last Monday Student Christian
association was privileged with an
unexpected visit of Sybil Williams,
a student of New Zealand. Miss
Williams met the cabinet for a short
while during her stay in Albany,
which was for the afternoon only.

Last weekend about fourteen stit-
dents from State attended the Stu-
dent Christian Movement confer—
ence which was held at Union col-
lege. These students were very en-
thusiastic and were greatly stimu-
lated by the talks of the conference
leaders. Edward C. Lindeman,
Georgia Harkness, and Sherwood
Eddy Were three of the important
speakers who led the various dis-
cussion groups.

 

Seniors to Have Meeting

Betty Hayf'ord. '39. president of
the senior class, has announced that,
there will be a senior meeting Tucs—
day in room 206 to elect an M, A. Al
representative and a songlcador. !

 

Sleuth Club Needed to Solve

Mystery of

State college students may soon
disoover a new club in its midst—-
a detective club, no less. What for?
Why, to unravel that mystery of
mysterlcs~intelligence tests! It’s
a sure bet, too, that the "select" class
of '42 was no less bewildered those
first few school days than pre-
ceding classes when they were un—
compromisingly herded into the Page
hall auditorium and impressively
handed tests, tests. and more tests.
So—all prospective members—watch
carefullywthe clues to the mystery
can be found in the following para-
graph.

Those tests that each new unsus-
pecting class is given include vari-
ous groups of questions, each group
designed to bring out a particular
characteristic, such as, reading and
comprehension achievement. general
learning ability, social inaturtiy, etc.
Though only some of the tests are
standard, all are compiled through
exact scientific research, and they
represent the work of various au-
thorities. Dr. Elizabeth Morris of
of the Education department at
State guides the giving of the tests.
The thirty-some persons helping
her are also members of State's
faculty.

Now for those couple of minor
(lctflils that aren't clear. Why must
they crowd everyone together at
once instead of having several

Intelligence Tests

©groups? Uniformity of conditions
for all and a saving of money and
time answer that one. And why
can‘t they wait until the poor fresh-
man is more rested and better ad-
justed to his new environment? Well,
for one thing, those giving the tests
want. to know just what they're
starting with, the “raw material"
without college influences. Moreover,
presenting the tests later would
mean a serious interruption of
schedule.

And when the uses of the data
obtained from the tests are con-
sidered, the fuss and bother seems
worth while after all. Within a
month after taking the tests a stit-
dent may inquire about the results
and obtain valuable information
concerning his aptitudes and diffi-
culties. his weak points and his
strong points in various subjects.
The faculty committee which dis-
cusses and acts upon personality
needs begin its work from the in-
formation of those same results. If
an individual faculty member won-
ders about the needs of a certain
student. the intelligence tests again
provide definite information.

A bird‘s eye view of such informa-
tion is shown in the individual
scores. State uses a Decal rank sys-
tem, i. c., the scores are arranged
in order and the tenths marked off.
The score, incidentally, is not an
IQ. but an indication of an IQ.
Translated as accurately as possible
to I.Q.’s, the scores show that State
students are high normal group, be-
tween 108-120. Hint: 130 and above
is genius! Although the lowest and
highest scores have been similar for
most classes, the averages have
shown a steady gradual improve-
ment, indicating. Dr. Morris points
out, the benefit of stricter selection
of students.

As for that “select” class of 1942,
results so far are these: almost
the same standing as ‘40 and ’41
‘in personality, but a slight increase
over ‘40 and '41 in readlng and com—
prehension and in range of inter-
‘csts. According to Dr. Morris. how-
tt-ver, neither freshman nor upper
classmcn have cause for worry, for
State college students “compare very

ithc noses of their rivals. Three
hundred freshmen crossed their fin-
gers for a Week and hoped the class
of ‘40 would never notice that there
hiid lll'Vt‘l' before been any pillows
in the lounge—and they didn’t!

The boys of ’41 kept an cvon firmer
hold on file banner when president
Stanley Smith entrusted it to their
gciitlc cui'c. Knowing that the sopho-
liltil‘t's rni'cly entered the Commons,
flii'y buricd it in the ignomiiiious
dirt of fill ush tray 1?). and once
mori- the rival class failed to un-
cover it. So the red flag of '41
survived the terrors of bunncr hunts
,inid t'liit‘i‘gi‘tl on Moving-up day at
line hcad of the class who, despite
iu-iny odds, had managed to tie
rivalry.

We look forward to keen competi-
tion bl‘th‘f‘fl the classes of ’41 and
'42, when binnier rivalry swings into
ill'lifill next month, and We hope we
are not disappointed. Tile present
soplioilloi'c class has shown its met—

the fresh have pul—ieiity of spirit,
so watch the red and blue felt fly!
