veteran squad which will return this
year with the loss of only one man,
manager Jitn Spence succeeded in
completing relations with some
schools which have not, appeared on

tion, which has an enrollment of
1,300 men. is consistently powerful
and rates among the best of the
state.

Second to Manhattan in the line
of prestige utid manpower ls Nia-
gara university. The Purple it‘agies

The defeat which Sam Coppolino
threshed from Bill Howe places Sam
as the undisputed champion Snead-
ling of our own little golfing set.
The game, in which Bill was de-
feated two up, marked the termina-
tion of golf on the intramural scale
for the fall season.

All games of the touch football
schedule will be ﬁnished by the end
of next week. Misplayed or unplayed
games to date will be included in
next week's program, which will be
listed on the bulletin board Mon-
day.

At this writing, KDR and College
house are at the top of the heap with
no defeats and but a single blemish
on their records, each team having

I tied one game.

Not far in the van of the two
leaders stand the Albanians with no
defeats and two ties. The strength
of this aggregation is evident from
the fact that their goal line is as
yet unsuilied.

The classic of the week will take
place either Monday or Tuesday
when the KDR strong arm squad
finally pitches into the College house
six in the game which has all the
earmarks of being the deciding bat-
lie of the season.

In any event, we’re picking KDR
TO WIN but by a very small margin.
