Realistic Presentation of Play
Results in Pandemonium at State

 

 

Did you bite?

Last Sunday night Orson Welles’s
decidedly realistic dramatization of
H. G. Well’s “War of the World”
caused the biggest sensation since
Minerva's staff was shattered! Thou-
sands of radio listeners, missing the
introduction to the play, Were seized
by a wave of mass hysteria upon
the announcement of an impending
attack on New Jersey and vicinity
by men from Mars and their "death
rays."

Panic-stricken citizens all over
the state attempting to avoid what
they believed to be a gas raid, ran

Freshmen Receive

Defeat in Pushball

The soph-frosh rivalry officially
began last Saturday afternoon with
the 'annual Campus day pushball
contest which was captured, by an
,8-3 tally, by an experienced sopho-
more team.

Entering the contest a traditional
10-1 favorite, the sophomores found
themselves on the short end of a 3-0
score as the first half ﬁnished.

As the second half began. the
bewridered sophomores became even
more bewildered as a fierce fresh-
men onslaught forced them to as-
sume the defensive role.

Finally, however, the class of 1941
snapped out of its lethargy and
pushed deep into enemy territory.

Newly Organized Orchestra
Will Forego Rehearsals
Until December

 

 

A discussion of all matters per-
taining to the latest attempt to form
a student symphony orchestra was
conducted yesterday afternoon in
room 100. This meeting was ten-
turcd by discussions of what music
ithe orchestra should play. who
should be the director. and when
rchcursuls should be conducted. It
wus decided thut no rchcursuls would
bc scheduled until after the Thanks-
giving recess in order to give stu-
dcnls an opportunity to secure their
instruments.

It \'us originally plunncd that Dr.
’1‘. Frederick ll. Candlyn. assistant
professor of music, would dirccl lhc
orchcstra, but when nmn'ouchcd on
this subject he unnouiiccd, with rc-
grct. that he did not bore the time
to zicCcpt this responsibility, How-
; ever, he asserted that he would be
