To A Gracious Laa’y

Usually when the wife of the president
of the United States speaks at a college she
is welcomed cordially for her position.
When a woman who has done great work
along social lines speaks she is greeted with
pleasure for this work.

Today, we have as our speakc' a lady
who combines both of these qualities. We
are proud to greet M'rs, Roosevelt because
of her outstanding ability, her leadership
of social betterment, and her all around
abilities. It is with pleasure that we cock
our ear to listen to her today.

 
 

 

Recessional From War

“Wi- \vcrl~ a great people once," he went all, “But that
was yf-stcrday. the day before yesterday. Now we are a
topic in ancient history. We had a great civilization.
They're still admiring it. Now I am in America learning
how to cut. llair. Wc-‘rc washed up as a racc. \vc'ri-
“mum” ' ' ' H —-\\‘lLLl.\M S.\ltl)l‘.\\.

On this Armistice day twenty years aft-
er the great holocaust that destroyed the
sanity, the youth, and the prosperity of the
world, today, twenty years later, we pray
that this nation of ours will realize the tre-
mendous task that lies ahead of it and not
go about wasting its energy on war from
which nothing useful ever comes.

In our country we have social disgraces,
such as slums, inadequate housing, scarcity
in a land of plenty, and twelve million un-
employed persons. We have at this time
many unfinished ,jobs to do to realize our
true destiny, we have no time to dawdle
on cnfcrprises which we know are harm-
ful, we must forge ahead. We should dc—
volc our energies and our resources to a
war on these evils and when the Armistice
is declared on this war there will be a real,
tangible cause for rejoicing, and there will
be no fears to mar the scene.

Let this lle a day of celebration of pcacc
and not preparation for war. if wo cnfc'r

Commentstater

(TI-IE COMMENTSTATER is given the widest
latitude as author of this column. though his view-
points do not necessarily always reflect those of the
S'rA'rc COLLEGE News.)

It seems that We are always congratulating the
Student Christian association on something or other;
this week it is the panel discussion on sororities and
fraternities that was conducted for the freshmen. It
was a noble attempt to bring the intrinsic values and
disadvantages of the Greek organizations to the fore,
and We welcome it.

Too long, We feel, the mainstay of the fraternal
organizations has been the glamour surrounding them,
and now this veil is to be “torn asunder." For the
first time bewildered freshmen had an opportunity to
meet with the members and non-members of the social
societies, and frank discussions brought the less evi-
dent beneﬁts to the fore.

Let us add our fire to the flame of S.C.A.'s good
intentions, We believe that sororities and fraternities
are essential for seine people. They lend the con!!-
dcncc and self—assurance of a congenial group that sonn-
people cannot do without. However, fhcrc are also
those strong individuals who can stand alone, and be

active in college life, at the same time making fast ‘

friends. In our mind, it all boils down to you, fresh.
and what kind of person you are.

secs

Three hearty cheers for the College House lads!
Yes, the Masque and Wig show is nearing produclion.
and the Commentslator is waiting with baited breath
for the opening performance of “Ten Nights in a Bar-
room." We hope that it will have all the fervor and
gusto of a Gay Nineties performance.

For many long months. we haVe been clamoring,
although our clamor has been unnoticed apparently,
for a return of the Troubadors. We have looked with
envy upon the Hasty Pudding show, and the Thosplan
efforts of other colleges, But We are finally to be
rewarded for our patience, and We‘re sure the Central
Avenue Gang won't let us down. Best of lflck to you.
Mr. Bogosta, and to your cost!

My esteemed l?) Statesman,

After absorbing your trash for a
month and feeling a surge of pity,
we—Who do get around—have de-
cided that you could use a little
information. But even 11' we haven‘t
any, we're still as good as you are.
We will ask you motivating questions
and we feel that the least you can
do is to run around the Commons
Friday spilling the answers.

First of all, can you tcll us why
they call him tell-o'clock Glll'ncy
when he sneaks down Hudson :ch-
nue at 1:30? And who murmured
“sweets to lhc sweet“ as the build
,ioyously pluycd “Happy Birthday to
You"? Aw, flinl‘s foo liard‘“!

Now We wont to Senior Hop and
saw some slrungi- fhings-«chi-u you
the ninety-ninth couple‘.‘i, Do you
suppose that lids and previous cvcnts
show Torrcns to be changing his
field or is llllll a Low-ry-mnrk'.’ And
who uof l‘l'cc bids offend?
you tell us why Qunlfrocchl finally
broke lhc ice?

Did the fact lhuf we changed from
lhc Aurimin club to Ten Eyck have
anything to do wilh
punclr~—or- shall we bar that onc?

Now, away from Senior Hop, mosf
of the people felt that way anyway!
What do you think of a guy like
Murphy who‘d chizzle on a chisclcr? " “
That guy'd slcnl the pennies from
the scnior sillilt. But wait a lnin—
nfc. I‘ll bet you haven‘t even sccn

boy, you ain't lived ‘Lill you lamp
flint outfit!

with whom the other llig‘llt?—~All(l
who didn‘t come to see Wilfrid Wal-
[or with whom the other night? We
don't care, do you? Who's going
to Inferfratcrnity with whom? Find
out quick—we want dates too!
However, even if you don't gcl
around you musl have some influ-

ence. Why 1101 see what you can do
about providing for the following
nccds:

Longer lesson plans for Gorman.

Minerva in n more secluded spot
for Arnold.

A broken flute for Giladcflc.

Personal
Viewpoints

(EGO is given the widest lati-
tude as author of this column,
though. his viewpoints do not
necessarily always reflect those
of the STATn COLLEGE Nsws.)

We note with some satisfaction
that our Greek letter girls are
finally going in for a bit of
revision regarding rush period
rules.

That Old set-up, so often mix-
ing up with exams, was bound
for change some time, and it's
just as Well that it comes now.
Besides the old period was too
long anyway. We’ll see how it
works now.

Is State college suffering from
a condition of acute apathy? We
mean this business of the hand—
ful of people who came to see
Wilfrid Walter, last Monday.
When We were a litflc freshman,
We remember that to get a bal-
colly soul of one of thcsc affairs,
one had to get here about six-
lhirly, and even then fllcrc
would bc a few slulwarls saving
all the seats in praclicnlly lhe
first two or three rows for their
brcfhrcn and sistcrn.

Last Monday, you could have
gotten a good scat if you came
when u was half over, Alld it
isn't lhc fault of D. and A.

It isn‘t often that one gels a
chance to witness such a per-
formance as Mr. Walter put on,
and there certainly Wcl'cll't an
abundance of other things
scheduled. It’s just plain indif-
fcrcnce . . and indill‘crcnce—
but a word to the wise is suf-
ficient!

Maybe, now that clcefion is
over, we‘ll be able to get through
a day or two without golfing
into an involuntary argument
about politics. The spiril around
hcrc has bccn more vigorous
lhan usual, even if the partisans
of the purlics have been too
hasty in jumping to their re-
speclivc conclusions. And we
do mean lhosc Acfivifics office

Colgate alumni will honor
Adna W. Risley and other mem-
bers of the ﬁrst football squad
of that university fifty years ago.
Over three hundred friends and
admirers will gather at the Mo-
hawk Golf club on December 10.

Dr. A. W, Risley, professor of
history in State, is just "Riz"
to all who know him. Many Al-
bany sports writers regard him
as “the dean of Albany officials"
as he has refereed in lnuny im-
portant eastern football games
for forfy-lwo years. His rctirc-
meal, from lhc gridiron in 1935
caused a great deal of lament
1 among sports lovers as far west
l as Denver.

I "Riv." was mainly responsible
I for the formation of an Albany
, alumni group, which has con-
duclcd for years its Saturday
lnnchcons of the University club.

Amyot Suggests Bosley

As Leash-led Mascot

It. should be brought to the
attention of the student body
that George Amyot, ’39, has
come through with a very novel
suggestion in connection with
the mascot contest sponsored by
the Sports department of the
News.

George suggested: “I would en-
joy leading Joe Bosley around
on a rope between the halves."

magnnnlmous. He was Willing
to sacrifice his chance to play
just so he could have the honor
of leading his winning sugges—
tion by the iail~feathers——beak.
or something.

The Sports department has
objected strcnuously—wcll, one
member has anyway, but don‘t
bc surprised at anything.“ strange
that may occur between the.
halves of future games.
