STATE COLLEGE NEWS, NOVEMBER o, [938

Yesteryear’s Economic Ideas Face Students Today

Almost 17% years ago to date,
State students were so interested in
economic problems of the day that
they established a Consumers'
league. The object of that league
was to acquaint the college students
with the industrial problems of our
country and to educate them in con—
structive measures for the solution of
these problems.

It is uncanny how history seems
to repeat itself in a cycle of seven-
teen and one half years. Today we
are faced with the very same prob-
lems, the only difference being that
the industrial Situation is more com—
plex.

The most striking coincidence is
the fact that this league was inter-
ested in “the living and working
conditions of the women and chil-
dren who make our clothes, can our
food. sell our merchandise, run our
elevators, and operate our tele-
phones." Today We are vitally in-
terested in establishing proper hous-
ing for the Working class of people

 

 

in proportion to their income, and
the elimination of slums, by lobbying
and persuading the voters to supply
sufficient funds, Students have in-
ﬂuenced the legislature during the
past four years to establish better
working conditions for women and
children, 81101] as lighting conditions,
floor space, Ventilation, heating, etc.,
and they [mice succeeded.

The Consumers’ league sponsored
trips through laundries and cloth-
ing factories and attempted to
inﬂuence the New York state
legislature by setting up its own
lobby. Do any of you recall
the Roosevelt minimum wage bill
and the Simpson elght-hour-day
bill which were sponsored by the
students of the college at that time?
This same interest is evidenced by

.the students of today who are in

favor of the Fair Labor Standards;
act which provides for a forty-four

hour week and a tWenty—ﬁve—cent,‘

minimum wage.

1 Students have always been inter-

 

 

...the blend that can’t be copied
.. . the RIGHT COMBINATION of the

ested in public affairs. To them has
fallen the burden of preceding gen-
erations. Today, We are more con-
scious of our burden, not only the
bin-den imposed by the great war, but
also the burden that is on the shoul~
ders of every American citizen—
“Whither the way for the working
man?”

“Nobody wins a war!" That’s Mrs.
Franklin D. Roosevelt speaking be-
fore the State college assembly in a
special Armistice day address last
week. “The only way to do away
with war is to make up our minds
that We have to find some machinery
to try to search out the things in
the world preparing war."

Throughout her talk, Mrs, Roose-
,velt stressed the fact that We must
lbegln to get rid of the fears that are
besetting us as a nation. She spoke
iratlier feelingly of her own experi—
ences in France at the end of the
last war; of her visit to a gloomy
hospital where “battered soldiers
Were being made over so that people
could look at them, and they might
take their place in society."

She called to mind the recent crisis
and its effect at the White House.
With its "sense of terrific doom and
tension." It Was really amazing to
realize that we. as a people, knew
more of What was going on than did
the officials during the World war.

Even in the countries concerned.

lacking free communication. some of
the people did not realize war was
linininent. But, “the one encourag-
ing aspect of the crisis was~we
did know!"

Mrs. Roosevelt shoch this trend
toward expression of public opinion
in its relation to the executive
branch of our government. The head
of a nation can know what to do
from the reaction of the people.
What he says "means more because
they are behind him." As she spoke
of the co-operation of South Amer-
ican and Northern European nations
in sending messages for peace at
her husband's request, she thought
it notable that, “they knew and were
unanimous in their decision that war
was not the way to settle the ques-
tion."

Comlnenting on what We can do,
she stated that unless We search out
the things causing war, people
will be forced to war to solve their
difficulties~which it emphatically
doesn‘t. The logic backing war is
flawless When the individual reaches
the point where he feels that be
either comes out of war ahead or is
killed.

To get peace We must do more
than say We are individuals and
don't matter in the general scheme
of things. We must stop shirk-
ing responsibility. Mrs. Roosevelt
said, in passing. “the only danger to
our democracy is that the people
will not carry their share of respon-
sibility."

When they do that, it's time to
worry, for then they will turn to
anything. We. here, want to remain
citizens of a country Where We can
have something to say about things.

Speaking of the Welles radio inci-
dent, she said, "if that is What mob
psychology can do to Us if we had
to face such a crisis, then all I can
say ls—-I'm ashamed."

“We are a free people and are
letting ourselves be ridden by fears
which amount to nothing if We know
What We set out to do, and do it.

In conclusion, Mrs. Roosevelt
wishcd. “I "out us to be the most
courageous people in the world, not
bccnusc We are afraid, but because
\l’c have so much confidence in our
plcslro lo be just, both at home and
abroad."
