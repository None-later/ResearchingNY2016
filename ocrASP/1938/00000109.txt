Lexington Ave. Express when I dis-
covered vla last week's Nws that
the College house players planned to
venture into the field of the illegiti-
mate stage and revive that uplifting
drama, "Ten Nights in a Barroom."
It was my impression that this saga
of the swinging door had gone out
with the Eighteenth amendment but
not so, this—the greatest tear-ierker
of them all—is scheduled for pre-
sentation Wednesday and Thursday
nights, December 7 and 8, in the
auditorium of Page hall. The al-
coholic gem is under the advisorship
of Mr. William G. Hardy, instructor
in English.

Realizing that this play had
slipped the memory of the many who
had been fortunate enough not to

began a decline that would not be
checked until the repeal of prohibi-

revivals, as well as many burlesques,
but it is hoped in dramatic circles
that this version by College house
will put an end to all such attempts.

Beginning next Monday, Al-
