.C.F.F.

With tiie initiation of the Page
hall hardwood floors into varsity
basketball struggles for the ’38-'39
season there arrives a name.

The name is nothing more (nor
less) than the unanimous selection
of the writer-inners to the sports
department as a suggestion for the
new nickname for this and future
State college varsity teams.

Varsity players, we now, at the
instigation and authorization of
aforesaid writer-inners, dub thee the
State college “OWLS.”

Reasons for the selection of the
nickname were not given by our cor-
respondents. We imagine that they
sort of juggled around the ideas be-
hind tiic “Pods” and the “Teachers”
and came out with the wise little
bird the owl, At any rate “OWLS”
seems to fit. Far be It from us—so
“OWLS” it  Besides, we sorta like
it ourselves.

As a follow up to the nickname,
we'd like to present here a public
appeal for a mascot to suit it.

Has anyone a stuffed owl
which they aren't going to use for
a while? A presentation ceremony
can easily be arranged—come on—
give the boys something to ﬁght for.

Basketball

The three basketball Lentils depen-
dent on State collcge go wide open
this weekend as tho State varsity
launches its season tomorrow night
against the Alumni at State while
the fresh start their season against
A.B.C, tonight on the YMCA
court. The Milne high aggregation
Will sec ilt‘iioli for the first time
tonight against Cialway with a pre-
liminary between the Jiiyvecs and a
local Albany live.

The Milne high varsity game ear-
ries another one of those interest—
ing “good pal" slants, hr the Galway
aggregation is coached by none
other than our own Jerry Amyot—
former tcammaie of Millie's present
mentor Merrill Hurd.

No information has been received
as to the strength of the Amyot
couched quintet, but if they live up
to the polish of the man himself~
wow! Hurd has given us his prob—
able starters for the game as:
Poland, captain, French, Childs,
Fink and Jones. 011 the bench, as
second team will be: Stevenson,
Gulnac, Scovcll, Lock and Plummer,

Milne Schedule

The Millie high schedule includes
the usual old favorites plus one new
opponent, Albany high. We are glad
to note that Milne is getting right
liito the Albany circle. Last year,
there was quite a dispute in the local
papers about strong teams of the
city. Milne high received quite a bit
of consideration but due to the lack
of comparison with other strong
Albany teams did not get the place
it deserved Here is another chance
to get that comparison.

The schedule features ten games
and includes:
Dec. 2 Galway.
Dec. 0 Delmar.

Purple and Gold Owls to Open SeasOn Freshman Squad

To Opptise A.B.C.

Freshmen
Show Great Promise
of Next Varsity

 

 

The State college freshmen bas-
ketball team will inaugurate its sea-
scn this Friday when it meets a
powerful Albany Business college
five on the Albany Y.M.C.A. court.
Although the schedule is rather
short, the formidability of the Frosh
opponents compensates for the brev-
ity of the program.

The short schedule was forced on
the frosh as a result of new rulings
which were simply orders to the
effect that only one game is allowed
each week, none during exam week
or during vacations, and none in
the midweek.

Manager Ed Melanson reports that
this squad of yearlings is one of
the best to come up in a long time.
With fifteen men on the roster,
Coach Hersh has rounded out a ﬁne
playing unit which is regarded to
be more than troublesome to its ad-
versaries. The ﬁrst team has fair
height, good ball handling ability,
and a speed that is generally above
average.

The squad as a whole has had
previous basketball experience. It
seems that history Will repeat itself
in that this present squad will sup-
plant the outgoing varsity men next
season.

Varsity captain Duke Hersh is in-
culcating into this group some of
his own brilliant polish. Hersh an-
nounccd that his starting line up
for Friday night will constitute the
following members: Bill Dixon and
Bob Hilton at the forward positions;
Paul Merritt and Virgil Scott at
guard; and Hank Brauner at the
pivot spot.

The rest of the squad is com-
prised of Leslie Graves. Dave Leh-
man, Bob Selfert, Ken Johnson, Bob
Lally, Joe Larko, Al Bulmer, Leo
Griffin, Phil Kaufman and Milton
Ray.

The trottcrs started off the year
with a 23~.’l2 defeat at the hands of
the Delhi Aggles, Another away
encounter, tlils time at Cobleskill.
brought the same fate to the Feds
with a 31-24 score. Apparently, the
return to the home course had little
effect on the runners as Alfred out-
raced them 36—19 prior to the re-
cent Morrisville run.
