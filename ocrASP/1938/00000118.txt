Food Cooperative for State

Among the many issues that were dis—
cussed at the last national congress of the
N.S.F.A. was that of student food coopera-
tives, a proposition for State which we feel
would be well worth looking into at this
time.

Under this system, a group of students
form an organization to buy food on a coop-
erative basis so that the purchase of large
quantities will reduce the original cost per
person. After the food is purchased, it is
either prepared for the table at some cen-
tral point and then distributed to the in-
dividual members, or else it is delivered
directly to the group house. This depends
upon the type of cooperative established
on the individual campus.

The value of these cooperatives has
been repeatedly shown by the establish-
ment of successful cooperatives on the
various college campuses throughout the
United States. The cooperative at the
University of Washington, which distri-
butes food from a central kitchen, has
made possible a saving of $70 per member
each year. At Lehr'gh university the inter-
i'raternity council has instituted a cooper-
ative buying association, which has re-
sulted in a thirty-five per cent reduction
of food costs. (.‘orncll has a cooperative
dining club which supplies meals to cnch
member for approxin'iatcly $5.00 per Week.

State college, we feel, offers good possi-
bilities for the establishment of a food co-
operative among the various group houses.
An organization could be formed, for ex-
ample, ol' the twelvc sororities and four
fraternities whose purposc would bc to pur-
chase and distribute all the food used by
these group houses. The management of
this cooperative would be in the hands of
students who of course would be paid for
their work. 'l‘lic latter would contact local
food merchants and wholesalers who We
believe would bc moi-c than eager to help
in this cutci'prisc. An organization would
thus be set up which would not only dis—
pose of l'ood~buying problcins for the in-
dividule group houses, but Would
bring substantial i'cdllclions in food costs.

We feel that it. Would be much to the ad-
vuntagc of the students of State college it'
this System of cimplu'ativcs were investi-
gated. It scams quite logical that any
effective money-saving oiltcl'pi'isc would be
readily accepted by a progressive group of
students.

Commentstater

(THE COMMENTSTA’I'ER is given the widest

laIi/udc as author of this cotumn. though his view-

points (to not necessarily always reflect those of the
S'rA'ri-z Col.l.l£(lE News.)

 

It seems that the student association is not appre-
ciative of the efforts of members of its body. If last
week's assembly is indicative of the way State students
conduct themselves at assembly programs. the Ad-
vanced Dramatics class should not produce any of its
plays before such an inconsiderate audience, but, in—
stead. should present them before people who are at
least cognizant of the work and effort; that goes into
these performances.

The least that We could do was to be quiet and
give our best attention to the actors who were striving
to put across a difficult play in spite of many adverse
circumstances. Do you think the talking and snicker-
ing in the assembly during the lines encouraged the
actors to give the best they had? It had just the
opposite effect. It tended to discourage their per-
formance because the students bclittled their art. It.
takes a long time. with much rehearsing, to remem-
ber your lilies. and. after that. a great (teal of time
is spent acting out the play itself. It seems that the
association should take a course on "How to behave
in company."

Perhaps the greatest distraction of all was the
opening and closing of doors in the back of the as-
sembly. Not only was the lighting effect spoiled, but
also many of the lines became a meaningless jumble
of words. The marshals Were not doing their duty,
and as a result these distractions tended to disorganize
the players all the more.

ii * t 4!

"Contrary to the statement in the News" has be-
come a regular feature in assembly announcements.
To the people who are making these announcements,
this sounds Very humorous but to those who gather
and compile the news, it is anything but funny. When
one of our reporters, after chasing around for two
days, meets the “newsgiver”, the material is “tossed”
at them haphazardly and often incorrectly.

or course, the announcement is anything but accu-
rate. When the so-called “news” is printed, these
“activity heads" come crying to the editor because
their sloppy information is not correct. A little more
cooperation in this matter would help not only the
ans but also the upperclassmcn who cannot find
time to come to our assemblies.

though his ricicpoints do not
nrccssarilg always reflect. those
of tho S'rn'ri: COLLEGE News.)

We just can't. lll‘ll) thinking of
our crock-brainrd friend—poor
little “date bureau." It seems
that business was a trifle too
dull for our fine-feathered
friend.

Our “friends” thought they
had a novel idea when they de-
cided to establish a “date bu-
rcnu“ at State. They were
doomed to disillusionment. State
students are not so backward
as to be taken in by such a
"phooey" idea; the students here
are socially minded enough to
secure dates for themselves with-
out any intermediary party to
stimulate them.

Now to turn to something a bit
more serious. We were glad to
see that State college has at last
become interested in the rcfugcc
problem of central Europe.
When the student association
gave its consent to appoint a
committee to nllcnd lhc confer-
ence at Union college, it showed
the finest spirit of a democratic
institution—that is——the preser-
vation of the ideas and ideals of
free speech and education,

After all is said and done. we
are all brothers under the skin.
We are all interested in promot-
ing the Christian spirit of peace
throughout the world. Whenever
a “crazed fanatic" attempts to
curb a portion of its people,
democratic prestige suffers.
Therefore it is up to all those
who are interested in keeping
democratic thoughts alive, to
extend aid to those college stu-
dents of foreign universities
who wish to continue their edu—
cation in a country that is free
from all restraint.

The play last Friday. was, to be
as kind as possible, mest uniorunate.
It has been presented here before,
and has been an astounding success.
For seine reason, this was not the
case inst week.

One. reason was, of course, that
the actors could not be heard, save
by a favored few in the first rows.
The rcst of the audience lost in-
terest. and the rustic. and occasional
laughter—when the lines were far
from the Cl;llliC11l~-\\'CI'C only the
iiulurnl results.

As rrgards the acting. Miss Chris-

.lcr. at her best. might hnvc saved

the ploy—but we have seen her
when she was far b:tlcr. Mr. Dry—
den seemed a bit wooden, and We
lost nearly all his lines. Miss Koonz,
on stage for a few minutes, wasn‘t.
just the wife we thought she should
be.

With the exception of the pillar.
which we understand \Vfls the work
of an outsider, the set was no more
like a cathcdral than the man in the
moon. No church ever had
benches—or pews—draped in a cloth
that reﬂected as brightly as did
those of last week. No shrine was
ever such—why didn’t someone think
of that beforehand? As for lights.
they were adequate, but you must
watch these floods that walk over
into the auditorium.

On the whole. we'll wait for an-
other set of plays before We make
any generalizations, but you're way
behind in convincing us of your
worth, Advanced Drainntics—You‘ve
set a pace—you've slipped—Now it
remains to be seen whether you can
get back into the groove.

give them——Wc seen

never enjoyed ourselves so much.

And this reviewer at least has never
seen the walls of Page hall shaken
by such gales of laughter.

old melodrama wasn’t? But when
the laughs started coming the scenes
were hilarious, All the actors are

of the game was done by one of
the managers who dribbch the

George Amyot was the oulslnnd-

played a nice defensive game. his
pass-work was up to par and he
chalked up five fields and a foul for
a total of clcvcn points. Lehman
and Walko with eight points apiece
and Simmons and F‘rnmcnl with
seven followed Amyol's pucc.

For the Alumni Lansing featured

About fifty peoplc have taken 11p
lbnskctbnll as n wlnlcr sport this
year, Virginia Mitchell. ‘40, basket—
ball captain. is particularly proud of
,lhc freshmen turning out for prac-
‘licc. Special attention should be
lgivcn lo the fresh because they are
lunusually clover in their play. But
since the sophomores are experi-
enced, ilie frosh will have to be
cspccinlly good. The rivalry game
between the, sophomores and fresh-
jmen, scheduled for this Wednesday,
Dccciiibci‘ 14. should be a hard-
i'ouglit game.

The basketball teams have been
ioi'gnnizcd for the inter-class contest
’wilh the following as managers for
ihcir class team: Julie Palmer. '39;
Virginia Mitchell, '40; Mildred

Brauner, .Finnegan Feature
as Fresh Drop Opener
by 46-38 Tally

The State frosh succumbed to a.
inst Albany Business college flve Fri—
day night on the Albany “Y” court
to a score of 46-38.

Coach Hersh started Merritt, Hil-
ton. Bi‘nuner, Dickson, and Scott.
Bci‘orc the ﬁrst quarter was over,
Stale led by 11—3. At this point Hersh
inscrth his second stringers. The
kids played exceptionally fast, but
Albany Business put on the pressure
and at half time the host led by
25-17.

During lhc first half. Albany Busi—
ness ccntcrcd its plays around Fin—
ncgun. high scorer of the contest.
There was no ten—second line and
consequently Finnegan laid back
near his basket. His team threw
passes to him with the result that
sank six field goals during the
first half.

The fresh first team played the
ntire second half with Selfcrt and
Lehman substiluting for just a min-
ute. Stole put. on a belated drive,
but never could overcome that lead
which the business aggregation had
set up earlier in the game.

The conspicuous elements in the
game consisted of frequent fouling
by the ABC squad. Nearly their en—
tire squad saw service because of
penalties. Evident also was the
strategy of Coach Hersh who alter-
noted his defenses from zone to a
man to man whenever the occasion
demanded it. It was this factor
which stymied the work of Finne-
gan. The business college start was
unable to really go on a scoring
spree.

State's outstanding performers
were Brauner, Dickson, and Scott.
Among them they totaled twenty-
cight of the thirty-six points, with
Brauner leading the attack with
thirteen.
