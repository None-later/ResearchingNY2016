State Will Cooperate in Drive

For Chinese

Would you walk a thousand miles
across mountains for a chance at a
college education? Could you take
lecture notes in a bomb-proof cellar,
or an examination during an air
raid? Can you imagine a student
body using caves as classrooms and
dugouts as dormitories? Chinese
students actually have been doing
Just such things since the opening
of the present Chino-Japanese War,
At Nanking and other universities,

thousands of students have had to

live and work in caves and dugouts.
Many have had to leave their de-
stroyed universities and move many
miles inland in order to continue
their studies. ‘
Out of one hundred colleges and
universities in China, thirty-ﬁve
have been totally or partially de-
stroyed, and others are being used
as barracks by Japanese troops, By
ox-cart and on foot, entire student
bodies have moved inland from the
war zone. They haVe traveled thou-
sands of miles through war-har-
assed country to frontier cities such
as Sian, Chengtu, and Kwenmlng,
where colleges are now re-openlng.
This mass migration of students
under the press of war conditions
has created a situation which needs
remedying immediately. The cities
into which they are moving are
totally unprepared to receive them.
They need food, clothing and Shelr
ter. Fellowship and recreation
must be provided to keep them from
breaking under the strain. The Chi-

Student Aid Fund

>the-lﬂcircumstances, but obviously;

they still need help.

Last year the Far Eastern Student
Emergency Fund raised $18,808 for
Chinese student relief. This year
the International Student Service
and the National Intercollegiate
Christian Council, with the coop-
eration of the National Student Fed-
eration of America, of which State
college is a member, and other na-
tional student organizations are
making a united appeal to all col-
leges to raise $50,000 in order to
carry on the work of rehabilitating
these Chinese students.

With the help of American college
students, these things can be pro-
vided. Always, of course, the bulk
of the money will be used to provide
the minimum necessities of life. Two
American dollars will provide board
for a Chinese student for fiVe Weeks,
Twenty dollars will cover his room
and board for the whole college year.
State college will cooperate in
the Far Eastern Service Fund drive
this year. An announcement will be
made in assembly one week from
Friday, at which time a collection
will be taken among our student
body for the fund.

Don’t Look Now But-—
Mailboxes Are Moving

Oh, geel I wonder where that
mail box can be—so do we,
so do we, so do We.”

This is going to be State’s
new version of a “Tisket-a-
Taskct" very Shortly for the stu-
dent mailboxes are about to dis-
appear from their familiar posi-
tion opposite the lockers in
Draper hall before we go home
for the Christmas holidays.

Where is the new domicile of
those “letter bearers," guys and
galses? It will be moved to the
corridor on the first ﬂoor of
Husted hall near the Hygiene
office. And still more wonder-
ful is that there will now be
four sections to the mailbox in~
stead of the present two. Prog-
ress has at last reached State.

Now when “billet-doux" and
warnings come out and there is
a general “plop” of students, the
Hygiene office will be very con-
venient, don't you think?

Sororities to Conduct
Annual Rushing Events

(Continued from page 1, column 5)
afternoon the sororities will learn
what freshmen that they bid have
likewise stated their preference to
join that sorority. Monday night the
sororities will send out their formal
bids which the freshmen will re-
ceive Wednesday morning.

In former years formal rushing
took place the weekend following
ﬁnal examinations. This year the
faculty has granted approval to this
tentative arrangement, which, if suc-
ccssful, will be incorporated in the
regular Intersorority rush rules.
