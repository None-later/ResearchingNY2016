We’d like to write a cheerful editorial
this week. — All about the glad Christmas
season and how the world and we students
will just have a ‘peachy’ vacation. Some—
how, we can’t make ourselves do this. Pos-
sibly because we feel too strongly about
some existing situations that seem likely to
explode the peace of the world.

Munich has come and the hope for re-
sults are gone. Once again we begin to
doubt M'r. Clnlmberlain’s sanity when he
threw the Czech nation into the dictators’
fangs to demolish. Perhaps, Mr. Chamber-
lain is trying to right the wrong accom-
plished by the treaty of' Versailles, Per-
haps—but to our minds two wrongs never
made a right.

With the war hysteria and fear that
existed then, there is little, perhaps, that
Mr. Chamberlain could have done, but
there exists the feeling in everyonc's mind
that he sold a nation down the river. And
with another crisis already arising in
Europe, We wonder what nation will bc the
next victim.

And if' Hitler l‘llovcs farther and further
west, as ho proposes lll .IIrin Kain/if, thcro
is little doubt that the two oppositcs, Russia
and (lcrmany. must lncct. And when that
day conics illc biggest war in history will
takc plucc. .-\nd all Nevillc‘s mczlndcrings
will not stop it.

 

 

 

Then, to us idcalisfs, what is tllc solu-
tloll~—-l'ollcl'ti\'c sccurity~—thnt is a doubt-
f'ul solutionwvcull the dictators" blnfl'~——thc
situation is now too for avalnnchcd for
that. We Amcriczln idcalists can only fight
for the pcslcc of our nation—“um cannot
allow oursclvcs to bc d‘uggcd iuto tho
muddlc, that is sfcadily dcvclopiug. We
must work for thc f'l'ccdon; of this western
world  f'rcl-donl from both (‘onununism

shall he wrought. And We who talk f‘ccbiy.
perhaps our little lnouthiugs will nccoln-
plish more than all the silent infcllcctnals.

‘Then Silence is Golden ? ’

— Commentstater
(TI-11.91 COMMENTS’I‘ATEE is gluon the widest
latitude as author of this column. though. his view-
points (to not necessarily (tilt'ttljh' reflect those of the
S'rlvrr: Common ans.)

It seems ungrateful, cvcn fmpertlncnt, that we
should criticize Intcrsororlty council after all the re-
forms that august and admirable body has instituted
this year. Yes, indeed, starting out on a pleasant note,
the feminine element on all sides is praising Allah and
the afore-mentioned council for moving up the animal
rush parties from February to last weekend.

The advantages of this reform are numerous and
apparent. In the first place, the sorority girl and the
freshman are spared the toll of rush parties and
pledge parties, intermingled with ﬁnal examinations,
In the second place, the week between exams and the
second semester will be a sort of pro-spring vacation to
break up the monotonous and nervo-wracking stretch
bctwccn Christmas and Easter vacations.

In the third place, girls, think of all thc Christmas
cards you'll save—or is that unduly calty?

However, our complaint is this, chronologically
stated: Rush parties were last weekend; at twelve
o'clock on Monday. the freshmen had signch on the
dotted line: at four-thirty or thcrcabouts, the various
sororities had received the final election returns.
Therefore. why the great sflcncc? Wc concede that
a silullt period from the lust function of rushing week-
end up to the four-thirty expose is a fine thing. Last
infinite persuasion and frantic rushing might be an
undesirable and disastrous result of a free and easy
policy, but we cannot understand the continuance of
the deaf and dumb show on into the Week.

We might quote Omar Khayyam: "The Moving
Finger writes; and, having writ, moves on; nor all
your Picty and Wit shall lure it back to cancel half a
Line, nor all your Tears wash out a Word of it.“ After
a freshman has turned in her preference list, the
fearful deed is done, nor can it be easily undone, and
so, We complain, why must hither—to close friends pass
silently in the halls, with only a knowing glance or a
meaningful “Hello”?

Of course that there is always the possibility that
poor sport sororities might attempt to change the other
sororiffcs' pledgcs' minds before pledge service on Wed—
nesday evening. It might be suggested: why wait for
Wednesday evening for this service? Why not con-
duct ft on Monday evening, and thus have a silent
period of only one. day? It seems that a system such
as this would ellmlflntc all the petty bickering that
gocs on among the Greeks at this time. Under this
systcm events could bc wound up on Monday, the
f‘rcshman women would be safe in 1110 sorority fold,
and chrybody would bc happy. Hero is a sound idcn
girls. Why not. think if. over?

State ’3 Stage

Good Acting
Setting ?
Costumes ?
PLAYGOER

Well, pushed hard enough, those
Advanced Dramatics lads and lassies
will show their mettle. Tuesday
brought two more plays. both of
them fine—

Thc first, Miss DcCotis’ offering,
proved herself a deft hand at creat-
ing moods, Her fantasy actually
stayed in the realm of fantasy for
its duration.

Miss Donnelly and Mr. Walters
had most to do with this, probably.
Theirs were ﬁnished performances.
Mr. Walters was at his best, as he
usually is in that type of role.

The other character parts of
Miss Thcurcr and Miss Clark were
also keyed to the play. The latter
was certainly a perfect neighbor,

Mr. Cassidy, of course, had a role
all to himself in the sccond play.
It might have been written for him.
He played it to the hilt. Mr, Fink
was good but he could have made

 

 

 

 

more of some of his lines, Miss
Stewart was an endearing ‘mama'

to perfection. Miss Arndt was a pre-
cocious little fourteen year old, but
We liked her performance.

One filing We did notice in both
plays—you‘ve got to watch technical

details, The lights in the ﬁrst play
worked havoc on Miss Donnefly's

features and weren't at all suited to
the mood. The ends of the stage
were in total darkness throughout
the second play, in spite of occa-
sional action.

Props, too, have been neglected.
To get down to the bare truth, these
stage furnishings we saw Tuesday
looked like something flint had been
thrown together a few hours before
the performance.

It's getting so bad that you don't
even bother changing furniture. We
get the same thick-armed antiques
—weck after week.

You've got to be careful. Loss
falcnfcd acting, and the plays could
haw: bccn lost—and merely because
of technical deﬁciency. Lot's have a
little time and 'arc spent on this
bchfnd-fhc-cln'ti'lin, little-publicized
part of stflgc production.

lN.B. And at that Wc think we're
being nice, by just not mentioning
costumes! l

Personal
Viewpoints

{EGO is given the widest lati-
lltdc as author of this column,
though his viewpoints do not
necr‘ssarill/ always reflect those
of the Srwrn Common ans.)

Incongruity, oh incongrufty!
That's our thought as We scan
things athletic this week. The
first bit comes as a result of
last week's ill—fated game. In
the papers' write-up of the fray,
we sure did ﬁnd out stuff and
things.

For instance, the RPI boys,
we are told, ‘had the spectators
in stitches' with their antics,
calling the State contingent—
“Oh, you Teachersl"—accompa-
nicd by a wave of their hand-
kcrchicfs—

Wasn't that cute?

They had a few more uncom-
plimcntnry cracks that we'll ig-
now here. The point is, we'd
like to start preparing for the
Enginccrs‘ trip here, right now.
Maybe \vc can makc ft \'fll'lll
enough for them that. those
hamlkcrchicl’s will be handy as
fans, Maybe we can lick tin-1n
so badly they‘ll never rccovcr.

Maybcwbut why talk of may-
bc's? EGO is wholeheartedly
behind any move for more school
spirit, and while we don't con-
done rcvcngc as policy, we think
we‘re mud enough to make an
cxccpllon this time.

if ii iii

lncongruity number two! What
on earth has a clipping dealing
with fraternities doing on the
MAA. bulletin board? We
thought that was to be used for
M.A.A. and Press Bureau an-
nouncclncnls.——lf wc‘rc wrong,
correct us!

About the only place for a
clipping of that nature, would be
in our ncyvs columns—either as
a digest or a feature. We
choose to believe that the clip-
ping wns posted by mistake—if
not, then We suggest that the
subtle propagandlst responsible
plcnsc rcfrufn from cluttering
nccdcd space with his announce—
mcnfs in the future.

24-22. Playing the best ball thus far
this season the Statcmen had the
spectators in a frenzy throughout the
contest. Time really defeated them.

This was a game marked by a ﬁne
offensive and beautiful bnll
handling and passwork, As for the
defense of the State frosh, it was
a trifle confused in shifting from a
zone defense to a man for man, Fur-
thcrmorc, incnfnl lupscs in defensive
play brought about their downfall.

Leading by four points with only
two minutes left to play. State paved
fls own way to dcf‘cnl by failing to
.‘iilll properly, lnstcad of moving the
ball continually and thus keeping it;
away from R.P.l._ the boys stood stifll
and lost it. R.P.I, took advantage,

 

to triumph.

Lehman nearly cvoncd the score
when one of his long shots rolled
and loopcd around fhc basket and
filmin popped out as the gun cndod
thc glunc.

iJcspifc tllc lnpscs and carelessness

' (ll the port of the foam of times. the

game was fast, exciting, well-played,
nnd cxtrcmcly hard-fought.

The highlights of thc l'rncns \vcrc
furnished by Virgil Scott, who
totaled one third of the team‘s
points.

College House Five
Defeats Commuters

College housc dcfcnfcd the Com-
muters in their intranmrnl basket-
ball game in Page half gymnasium
Tuesday night by a score of 33-13.
The Potter club-Kappa Beta game,
originally scheduled as the second
half of a double—header, was post-
poned in deference to the Advanced
Drmnatics play.

College house appeared with a
strong team, possessing speed,
height. and deception. In contrast,
the Commuters were somewhat dis-
organized and could not seem to get
started.

John Edge chalked up seven field
goals and two fouls for a total of six—
teen points, a new high for the sea-
son, Howcvcr, Lyle Lawton seemed
to be the keystone of the team, set—
ting up numerous plays and baskets,
In addition, he managed to net nine
points for himself.

For the Commuters, Patsy Turino
was the only one who seemed to haVe
his shooting eye. He dropped in ten
points to gather in almost all of
his tcam's lnurcls.

The ncxt scheduled gnmc will not
be played until after New Year‘s
when College house will meet Ava-
lon-Spencer and the Albanians will
engage SLS, on January 3.

STATE LEADS AT HALF

R.P.i. Clicks inwLast Half
to Swamp State Five
to Tune of 29-22

by Joe Bosley

The State varsity squad dropped
its ﬁrst intercollegiate game to
chsscluer Polytechnic Institute last
Saturday night by a score of 29-22.
Dropped is the proper word too, be-
cause they lot it slip as if it were a
red-hot iron. They were defeated
by a team that couldn't hold its own
in a fast game of holly-golly.

Slate‘s passwork was terrible but
their shots were worse, Things got
so bad that spectators began to
duck when R.P.I. lost the ball. There
was no teamwork whatsoever shown
by our quintet; they just threw the
ball in the general direction of a
yellow jersey.

The boys did have some tough
luck with their shots. Many of
them rolled around the hoop and
just dribbled back to the playing
court but too many attempts were
missed by a city block. Some of the
lads didn‘t know enough to stop
throwing when they weren't coming
close.

State had a 12-8 lead at the half,
only because the Trojans were a
little worse at everything. However,
at the start of the third quarter
R.P.I. began to work more smoothly
and shot into the lead, Their team-
work clicked sufficiently to pass a
dcmoralizcd squad. Ludke, who
amassed eight points for the winners,
led the attack against the State lads.
Fazioli, captain of the R.P.I, outﬁt,
saw very little action in the game.

The starting lineup for State was
composed of Simmons, Hersh, Fra-
ment, Lehman and Ellerin. This
ﬁve had enough ﬁght but couldn't
seem to do anything right. Captain
Hersh played a beautiful defensive
game but offensively he was way off.
Ellcrin played the ﬁnest game of any
of the State men. He fought plenty
hard and passed nicely in an at-
tempt to get the offense started. But
the offense never did get started.

The pay—off came mid—way in the
third quarter, “Elinor Layden" Hat-
ficld threw in his second squad “on
mcss" to stem the Trojan tide. It
was the poorest bit of substituting
we have ever seen; fifteen year old
doc Jones from Podunk Center could
have done better. Any of the ﬁve
or [on men that played the second
half could have gone well with four
of fhc regulars but all together they
didu‘f llul’c a chance. They were too
small to got the bull and loo nervous
lo do anything about it whcn they
did get it. They did well by slipping
only 11 few points behind the R.P.I.'s
but that didn‘t win the ball game.
During the lust fcw minutes, sonic of
llll' antc roofcrs wcrc on the point
of' asking Coach for n gnmc, Whllc
olhcrs \vnlkcd our in disgust.
(lrnnlcd, fhc starting fivc didn‘t play
buskclbnll but lhcrc was always the
chnncc fllul lhcy would snap out of
lllf'll' lcllml'gy. It's onc lhfng to fight
for if gumc uguinsf odds, but us a
horsc of ll diff‘crcnl color to throw it
u\\‘uy.
