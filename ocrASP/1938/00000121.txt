STATE. COLLEGE NEWS, DECEMBER 16, 1938

Will Move Mailboxes
Opposite Locker Room

Hear ye, hear ye! You can go
to the recovery room after get-
ting your mail if you want to,
but you won’t Me to be there,
or in the vicinity. According to
the latest, most authentic report,
the student mailboxes will not
be moved to the ﬁrst ﬂoor or
Husted hall, as previously
planned and stated. Due to un-
favorable student opinion, the
actors of Campus Commission
and Myskania, it was decided
that the mailboxes should re-
main close to familiar haunts.

When you come back from
your Christmas vacation, you’ll
ﬁnd the mailboxes moved, but
not far away. No indeed, they’re
going to be placed in the cor-
ridors on either side of the mid-
dle staircases coming down
from the Rotunda of Draper
hall, opposite the girls’ locker
rooms. This will relieve the con-
g‘estion, and at the same time
please unhappy students.
