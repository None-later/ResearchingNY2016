Actor Sends Student

Sigma Lambda Sigma is "put-

you heard that they’ve been
strutting around like proud
papas. Why? Well none other
than Burgess Meredith, stage
and screen star, who incidental-
ly knows one of the fraters.
sent him a four-month old
police dog with a pedigree, no
less.

Meredith, who has a great
fondness for dogs and makes a
hobby of raising them. ex-
plained that the “perp’s” name
was Hamlet but the boys figure
that's too much to remember so
they call him Ham for short.
Now we know the theater is
“going to the dogs."

Maternally. patiently, and lov-
ingly, Charlie Shafer et al. are
trying to teach the mutt to do
the right thing at the right time
and of course in the right place.
Can't you hear them a-crooning
“Git along ieetie doggie."?

No wonder the boys have
such unaccounted "pup." Ouch.
I better stop before this gets
downright doggerei. So long,
folks, "canine leave you now."

Harpsichordist

Under the auspices of Music coun-
cil, the State college choral society

cert next Friday in Chancellor’s hall

cf world renoun, will appear as guest
artist. State students will be inter-
ested to note that Mr. Kirkpatrick
is the brother of Miss Alice Kirk—
patrick, a librarian in the college
library.

Kirkpatrick Famed Musician

The events of Mr. Kirkpatrick's
life give ample evidence that his
fame is Well deserved. He was born
in 1911 in N. Leominster, Massachu-
setts, but it was not until his college
days at Harvard that his career with
the harpsichord began. At that time,
when the college obtained the in-
strument, Kirkpatrick was permitted
to use it. He worked out his own
technique and was able to give a
concert before his graduation.
Regcogntion of his talent was given
in the form of the Paine Travelling
Fellowship in Music which enabled
him to study in France and Ger—
1 any.

Since that time, Mr. Kirkpatrick

cotic Division of the State De-
partment of Health will address
this morning’s assembly on the
evils of marijuana. Mr. Smith
has been assigned the task of
combating sales of marijuana
in New York state.

The recent increase in mari-
juana addicts has aroused the
public to crusade against this
latest evil to health. The drug
has become popular with the
adolescents of high schools, who
look upon the practice as the one
smart thing to use.

Mr. Smith is coming to State
college at the request of Dr.
George M. Wiley, associate com—
missioner of education, in order
that State students, as future
teachers. will be able to acquaint
high school students with the
