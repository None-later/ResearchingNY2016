Are Activities Cliqacish .3

"Oh, I wouldn't go out for that activity. I don't rnte
with the people In power. I never travel with their clique.”
Non-uctivity member's excuse.

 

 

Yes, you’ve heard the above statement
before—perhaps you’re one who has made
it. And if you are, hide your head, because
if any statement was ever false that one
above—that of a sluggard—is.

We’ve found that the only way you are
accepted by an activity’s crowd is by work-
ing on that activity. If you get out and
help the staff, soon they’ll have you as a
part of their clique. Look around you at
the various groups working together on
various school organizations. Do you sup-
pose they were all friends and all started
work on the same activity just to prolong
and strengthen the bond? That, of course,
is absurd. They are friends because they
Were interested in the same task and a
union grew between them because of this
work on an activity.

Take a look at the things in school that
students have to participate in—then, see
how many students are actively interested
in them. Go to any intercollegiate debate
and see how many ‘statents’ are there. The
few that are present are members of the
squad. Is that because the debates are so
exclusive! ()r isn’t council friendly
enough? Debates and the squad are not
closed corporations; even if' you were not
good enough to make the squad, you can at
least worry the round table men with your
questions.

Our departmental clubs have only a
few followers. Why'.’ Our magazines have
a limited number of‘ cubs. Again, why?
Few students participate in many intr-
murals. Another why? None of these are
exclusive nor do they require any special
equipment or set of" friends to become a
member of them. Are we too bored or too
busy for such things? Or is it because
we’re too lazy?

There’s a lot of fun for the non partici-
pants if they’ll just become a bit more ac-
tive, and that means more and better ac—
tivities.

 

Unwept and Unsung

 

 

Commentstater

(THE COMMENTSTATER is given the widest
latitude as author of this column. though his view-
points do not necessarily always reflect those of the
STATE COLLi-zcc News.)

If you can remember as far back as the pre-
Christmas vacation stretch, you may recall the Friday
We commentstated on the poor support of, and co-
operation with, the basketball team. We haVe an
apology to make. You see, We blamed it all on the
general apathy of the student body toward our athletic
functions, but We were called to task, and so We have
ferreted out the real reason. It all revolves around the
old adage that you can’t be in two places at one time.
Almost every time there is a big basketball game, we
find by consulting the college social calendar, there
is also some other activity in the college.

Now, there is nothing We like to see around college
more than a lot of activity; however, it burns us up
when Friday night comes and we have to neglect one
of our interests to participate in another. Call it look-
ing a gift horse in the month if you will, but we feel
that we’re not getting our money's Worth out of the
already over-worked student tax ticket.

However, We don't want to be selfish about the
whole thing. The angle of the situation which is sel-
dom considered concerns the basketball team itself.
Most people don’t realiZc that the members of the
varsity and freshman squads will be missing, among
other things this year, the Elementary Dramatics
plays. the winter concert sponsored by Music council,
and all the events of Junior weekend. The game itself
means a lot to the fellows who play it, yet it hardly
seems fair to expect them to limit their college activ-
ities, when, at the same time, we are limiting the sup-
port the student body can give them.

Of course, it's too late to do much about this year’s
situation. Rival teams and guest artists are usually a
bit reluctant about cancelling contracts, but there is
always next year, and we think it could be worked
out very satisfactorily if, in the spring, the heads of the
various activities sponsoring college programs and
entertainment could meet together and plan some
tentative program so that two important events which
include a majority of the students would not take place
concurrently, v a l t

 

 

It isn’t often that the News gives a plug—and a
free one, at that, to another publication. Call it pro—
fessional jealousy if you want to, the Lion being ex-
cepted, of course; but this time the Staid College News
does break down, and our pat on the back is for the
Pcdagoguc.

This year the board has planned a super-Pea,
and We hope their efforts will not go “unwept and un-
sung." We offer our best wishes to the 1939 Peda-
goguc, and we hope that this year will be a great one
for them.

Jam and Burnt Toast

Over the vacation many of us listened to or saw
in person many of the prominent dance bands. One
of the best of the new organizations has been that
of Leo Brown and his Blue Devils, whose music has
been coming from Hotel Edison, New York. The other
new top aggregations are Glenn Miller from the Para—
disc, and Erskine Hawkins from a number of spots.

Of the older established bands, the Master, B. G.,
has been breaking all records at the Waldorf-Astoria.
His style has changed again, back to that of his early
days. He is still the top whch swing orchestra in the
country, Artie Shaw who is now loading Goodman
in Downbeat’s poll for King of Swmg, has turned out
some swell music from New York’s Hotel Lincoln. It
has been great swing, but we feel that the loss of Hall!-
day is a great loss to our Soiree maestro. Our trumch
man of another Soiree, licrfgnn, has slipped a lot
since his lop days of a year zlllU- his hum can‘t hit
the hot notes as formerly, and we rather feel that
he’s a washout. He still has one of the nicest theme
songs of them all, however.

in colored bands the tops in swing is Count Basic,
with Cab Galloway, Duke Ellington, Earl (Father)
Hines, and lfil'Skll’lf: Hawkins. All except Hawkins are
Well known —-- this Hawkins mun plays one of the
hottest trumpets imaginable and the band behind
him is a solid jive unit.

On the sweeter side, Tommy Dorsey with his
constant repetition of the Marie theme and some
neat sweet arranging, is rapidly becoming a great
swcct band. Glen Gray. who started hot. back to the
top, is now the top sweet band on the card, closely
followed by Hal Kemp and Enoch Light. Sweet bands
have relied a lot on contests to keep them in the
i'unnlng——sucll bands as Kay Kyscr, Del Courtney, and
llcidt do this. We often wonder what would happen
if they started depending on music.

Aren’t those new mailboxes
something to tell about in your
ﬁrst 1939 letter home? We want
away expecting that the old
boxes would be transfered bodily
to their new resting places.
That We would haVe additions to
the letter space was beyond ex-
pectation. But to come back
and find them all individually
lighted besides, is almost amaz-
ing. First few days’ use has
demonstrated the advantage of
the new location. The “mailbox

Goodness gracious me! What's
happened to the old days of
freshman - sophomore rivalry?
Seems to me that thc only thing
that's happened this year was
the freshmen singing in assem-
bly one Friday. Aren’t We to
have any rivalry debates? Will
We have no more sings? And
banner rivalry —— my, oh my!
Isn't there something that says
the banner should be in school
one week each semester? It
hasn't been yet, to our knowl—
edge, There‘s also a little item
in the fresh handbook about a
football game that We don't re-
call bcing played. Organized r1-
vnlry can be a heck of a lot of
fun, but it does take a cer—
tain amount of class spirit. Let-
ting everything go till the last
cat is hung, or plainly, till the
end of the semester, can be very
distressing. What with exams,
and term papers, and the like,
rivalry is going to ﬁnd itself a
minor part of many an over-
crowded schedule.

EGO.

 

Hellenics

 

Greetings, Happy New Year, and
all that to all you gals! May this
year be kind to you, and give you
the kind of things you want.

We're sorry to be so brief with
Hellenics this week, but what can
we do without material or any in-
formation?

AEPhi starts the new year right
with one marriage and two engage-
ments. Nice going, girls! The mar-
riage is that of Phyllis Grossman,
'36, to Milton Haven, a graduate of
Syracuse university. The engage-
ments are those of Funny Tcppcr to
Hyman Goldstcin, a PhD, 7f Colum—
bia university, and Marion Topper
to Jerome Obcrsfein, musician.

PAT comes up with a marriage,
too. Dora Levine, ‘35. was recently
married to Morris Knupman of New
York university.

And so, until next week, when
things should be a little more active,
so long!

 

Students List G.O.P. Gains
as Nation’s Top Event
of Past Year

From the results of a poll taken
in the two sections of History 111
this week, State's students have be-
come selecteurs, to coin a phrase, as
well as connoisseurs of the world's
new events. The poll had for its
object the listing of 1938's top news
stories.

Favorite of the voters was the
September-October Czechoslovakian
crisis with the attendant Munich
agreement. Following the leader
came: the persecutions of the Jews
in Germany, the resurgence of the
Republican party in the November
clcctlons——thc failure of the ill—fated
‘Purge‘. Hitler's annexation of Alls-
tria, and the recent Lima conference
with its subsequent declaration of
Lima.

None of the fourteen topics men-
tioned cvcn approached the amaz-
ing 10nt of the Czechoslovakian
crisis. This subjch polled morc than
two and one-half times the vote, of
tho second news cvcnl. mcnllzncd.
Howcvcr, [he cvcnt which was most
offcn mcnfit n! (l was the chublicnn
turn displayed in the elections. This
10pr was listld at some point on
nearly every ballot.

Following closely behind the out-
standing live events of the year, was
Japanese aggression in the Far
East and the war scare provokcd by
Orson Welles. Other stores mcriling
rccogntion were the French general
strike and the Caster—Musics scan—
dnl., the (loath of Patrick Cardinal
Hayes, the Hines trial, and the Rose
Bowl game.

In deference to Professor Rislcy,
who teaches both sections of History
111, one loyal student suggested
Syracuse's unexpected triumph over
Colgate as a possibility.

Locally, a faithful supporter rec-
ommendcd the following as the No.
1 news beat of the year: “Kluge
Elected to M.A.A." Surprising
enough, no votes were cast for Doug
Corrigan's wrong-way flight or for
State college’s acquisition of a new
clock.

STATE COLLEGE NEWS, JANUARY 6, 1939

 

 

Brass

.C.F.F.

 

 

 

When we stop to peruse the effects
of four nights on a court, staged
by a local aggregation, We find that
the local live, known as the varsity
five, or the owls of State College for
Teachers, have fared not too bad-
ly . . . nor too well.

The records show two close vic-
torics, over Brooklyn Poly and Ham-
ilton, the week before vacation, :1
loss in a ragng contrast to R.P.I.,
the week preceding, and a victoryl
over the Alumni in the opening game!
of the season.

The tally cf the Alunmi fracas,
was no indication of the condition
of the team. The victory, by a
score of 50-34 came in spite of
ragged parasing and lack of team-
work.

The journey to R.P.l. was a veri-
table trip. Morc fun was had by all
in getting all hot up about [lie or-
tistic write-ups in local papers than
in thoughts about the game. Prac-
tically the some mun which
knockcd the hide off R..P.l. lost your
to the tunes of 38-26 and 57—215 went
down to an inglorious dcf’cul of 29-l
22. The difficulty in finding the
basket may lznvc been due to its
tightnch and luck of pos‘ui:n. bill
the zulmirnblc hcadwork displayed
should have made up for lllllt

in the Brooklyn Poly set-to. a
slight improvement in form was no-
ticeable, or maybe, Brooklyn l’oly was
just bad. As far as we can see,
Brooklyn Pon had little on the ball
except thumbs. 'i‘hc Owls showed
a few attacks of good passing. Not-
ably, Simmons and Amyot showed a
reversal to good old form to help
win by a wee margin, 30-32.

The Hamilton thriller showed the
team rounding into something near
what might be called shape. In fact,
if we accede to the landings given
the team by reports. we'll have to
admit that the future looks bright.
Melanson, manager of the frosh
squad, Cl'CtllLS the varsity with the
neatcst bit of teamwork in two sca-
sons. The nip and tuck struggle was
ﬁnally garnered in the closing sec—
onds by Duke with a field goal, mak-
ing the melody beat out, 40-42.

The increasing high scores in the
tough contests gives us a cleaner
face to stick out at Niagara and
Manhattan. High nettage will be
needed in these tWo contests, for the
punches will count more as scoring
punches in these. which will be high
scoring contests, than as bats away
from the basket.

The grads are rapidly gaining a
reputation for being bogcymcn as
the result of two excellent showings
in intramural scraps. Practically

Camp Johnston is being sadly
neglected these days ~— if it's still
Lllcl‘Cl And as for as We can see,
it will be devoid of occupants until
cxmn “vacation.” But A.A.'s advisor,
Mrs. Ticszcn, did remember Camp,
with a Christnms present of two big
vegetable bowls, which will be in-
itiated during the between semes-
ters holiday.

Until then. see you at ten, gawplng
at ski equipment.

Captain Parlzot tells us that the
riding business is practically at a
standstill because of the icy condi-
tion of the bridle paths. She claims
that riding is really more thrilling
when there is a hazard like that to
overcome. “But cf course nobody be-
lieves inc, and besides, cvcrybody‘s
sissics, anywayf!”

Dear Brass Knuckles:

In reference to the preceding
paragraph, it seems that the invita-
lion you extendcd to the hardy vlrilc
members of the “stronger sex” failed
to have the proper or rcquhud effect.
In other words horseback riding is
not always hard on the horse, To
say they are “slssies” would be put-
ting it. Very mildly. The more stren—
uous sports, such as basketball, fenc-
ing. boxing, touch football, tennis,
"and the more common parlor
sports," had a greater hold upon our
friends than did the lure of the
nl'cnl. outdoors.

’l‘o ndvocnfc further sports along
this line would Sl‘t‘lll futile. I-lowcvcr,
We of' this llf'j)!ll'l.lll('llL will undcrlnlw
lo suggest one more attempt to reach
an ultimate conclusion, joint pur-
llf‘lllflllflll in sports by members of
both organizations.

So, let's ntlcmpl. once again, with
not the some results as lost your
a winter carnival, but. with skating,
skimp, sleigh riding as n solution to
a Very vexing problem so for as
winter sports are concerned.

Love, Annie.

cent of the graduates rcccivcd jobs.
The placement record begun to drop,

continuing to its prosan figure.

Dr. Ilcrmnnn Cooper, assistant

reaus in his report, and urged a
thorough followup service.

Brooklyn and Hamilton Fall
in Weekend Clashes
with State Owls

The State varsity closed up the old
year with a bang—the kind we like
to see—~when they pulled out two
close victories over Brooklyn Poly
and Hamitlon. ,,
It was a much improved outﬁt
that took Poly to the tune of 32-30
on the Page court. The game was
thrilling and hard-fought all the
way, In the last few minutes the
spectators were sitting on the edge
of their seats, tense with excitement.
Some of the rosters were standing on
the edge of other pepole's seats and
even on other people. Frament, Leh-
man and Simmons led the offense
for the Owls.

Friday night. State journeyed to
Clinton and wholed Hamilton by a
score of 42-40. Both squads tossed
'cm in plenty fast as the eighty-two
points testify, Lehman with ten
points featured for State with the
able support of Framcnt's seven and
Torrens' six. Jackie Williams, star
sophomore forward on the Hamilton
outfit. gave the boys a tough session
as he heaved in nine field goals and
two foul attempts for total of twenty
points.

State had two strikes on her as
the team took the court for this
game because the Hamilton floor is
one of the oddest things possible.
A running track circles around the
edge and overlaps the corners and
gives a great incentive to throw” the
ball at the big round thing instead
of the little one. However, the team
overcome this handicap and went in
to register a swoll win.

This Friday the squad faces Con-
nectlcutt State Teachers in their
third home game, A few years back
the Connecticut lads sent over a.
good team that gave our fellows an
anxious evening. They have a pecu-
liar style of looping shots that are
difficult to stop and interesting to
watch. Let's hope the lads get hot
with the New Year and send the
Connecticut athletics home with
their tails between their legs.
