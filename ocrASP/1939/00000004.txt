We Give You -— Albany

We hear much discussion about partici-
pation in State’s activities. We are whole-
heartedly behind any program that enables
everyone to participate in college affairs,
including varied extra-class activities, and
we wish more people would see the import-
ance of this participation. We realize that
many people don’t have time to do much
around school, but most people do have
some free time.

How much do any of us know about
Albany? (Unless we live here!) How
much are the majority of us acquainted
with anything outside the confines of the
walls of State college? Are we acquainted

' with Albany as an interesting place, histori-

cally, politically, and scenicaily, as well as
knowing it as the home of State college ‘2

Albany has fine buildings, many of his-
torical interest, including the Philip Schuy-
ler mansion, and the old Albany Academy,
which now houses the city education de-
partment, where Joseph Henry first dis-
covered the secret of electro—magnetism.
Albany is the oldest chartered city in New
York state; it was early an important port.

How much do you know of the fascin-
ating history of this city, where you go to
school (we don’t say—where you lice.)

Albany has many fine places offering
cultural advancement to those who are will-
ing to expend a little time and trouble to
get it. How many students visit the Albany
Institute of History alid Art, unless they do
it for an Art course? How many of them
have visited the museum in the State Edu-
cation building, or know anything about it,
savo that the libraries are on the second
floor? The (‘apitol, olie of the most expen—
sive in the t'nlled States, could furnish
quite a bit to us, besides the lerislntive
sessions.

Albany offers much iii the line ot'
amusement, and appreciation of other
forms ot' art. Albany does have theatres,
and many presentations of interest to music
lovers.

This is only a beg‘nninl,r of all that Al-
bany has for you, 11' you'll take it. The rest
is up to you, and we ask you: What are
you going to do with Albany 1’

We know you’ve heard this before, but
We wish you’d take it seriously, for we sili-

cerely believe that you’ll be a much better

teacher if you really live iii Albany these
four years.

 

 

Dances and Spluiges

 

 

 

Commentstater

(THE COMMENTBTATER is given the widest
latitude as author of this column. though his view-
points do not necessarily always reﬂect those of the
Sure COLLEGE News.)

It seems that State college likes to splurge the
money it hasn’t got, when it attempts to be “big shots"
at class dances. It wants to hire orchestras that cost
between four hundred and six hundred dollars in order
to say: “We had ’so and so' at our Junior prom or
‘such and such’ at our Sophomore soiree." But where
do the classes end up finally? In the red for one or
two hundred dollars! That is poor financial manage-
ment when such a small organization cannot meet its
income adequately.

A point to be considered is that this dance,
the Junior prom, is a class dance, a dance given by
the class for its member and supported by them.
It seems however the socialites neglect this point of
view. The bids for these dances are so exorbitantly
liigh—$3.50-$4.00—that only the fellow with a "full"
pocket is able to attend. There are very few persons
who come to State that can afford to spend between
seven and tWelve dollars for an evening's entertain-
ment.

Who goes to theSe dances? None other than the
same crowd over and over again. If the object of
these dances is to bring the same group together all
the time, why not let them form a social club and make
and sponsor their own functions. Instead they chisel
upon the good nature of those students who pay dues
to support the dances and who are called upon for
more support when the dance goes into the red.

If the price of bids comes down to one fifty or two
dollars, a larger percentage of the class will be inter-
ested in supporting their class in a dance they feel
they can attend.

The result would be a better attendance at all these
dances. A better spirit of friendliness and cooperation
will be the bond that is formed. At the same time.
other class members will be interested in a poor man’s
dance.

An important issue that is overlooked is the large
costs of "incidental" expenses, Programs cost between
seventy and eighty dollars. Would this be a reason-
able price that the ordinary “John Citizen" would pay?
There is doubt that the other “lncidentais” run pro-
portionately as high as the bids, such as decorations
and refreshments.

If we want to conduct successful dances here at
State, they should be given so that all the committees
will spend a minimum instead of the maximum amount
allowed for them. Then and only then will we have
dances that will ﬁt the purse of the ordinary student
and at the smile time will balance the budget or even
carry an amount over into the black.

Boo/e of the Week:
A Canine Ulysses

Journey of 'i‘aploln, by Robert Nathan. New York,

IOn solo in the co-op)

A long time ago, a fellow by the name of Ulysses
went on a trip, and another fellow by the name of
Homer wrote a long poem about the journey. Just last
week we picked up the story of another journey—
chronicled by the facile Robert Nathan—the odyssey
of a twelve-inch long Yorkesbire terrier, who decided
to go out into the world and become a hero.

You can enjoy yourself reading the story as a sim-
ple fantasy, or sort of overgrown fairy tale. You can.
too, if yoil prefer, tie it up with the foibles of our
modern world in a hodgepodge of satire and symbol-
lsni. It‘s infinitely more t'un. if you don‘t try to read

Personal
Viewpoints

(EGO is given the widest lati-
tude as author of this column,‘
though his viewpoints do not
necessarily always reflect those
of the STATE COLLEGE News.)

Well, well, well. As if in
answer to our queries of last
week comes the vigilante com-
mittee. Designed to insure the
sanctity of our traditions and
deal with those who defy them,
it can ﬁll a justifiable need.
And let’s hope that the frosh
soon realize that We do have a
fair background of tradition that
they would do well to assimi-
late.

We welcome that sudden in-
flux of chairs and benches about
the confines of the Annex. The
numbers of people who were
forced to eat their lunches in a
sort of stacked-against-the-wall
position was beginning to be
somewhat of a traffic problem,
as well as an inconvenience.

Perhaps. We students might
like to pledge ourselves to a sort
of reciprocal agreement with the
unknown donor—something like
keeping that area relatively free
from litter.

til 1! it 1

And we'd like a point of in-
formation. Is this dancing after
basketball games going to be
curtained at 11:30 o'clock all the
time? And why? If the fresh
have to be in, which is the only
reason We see, they can leave
without inconveniencing the oth-
er students.

Or, if it is to prevail, why not
keep the games to schedule a
little more rigidly? Last week's
game, scheduled at 8:30 o’clock,
got under way at about 9:45.
And it wasn‘t so much the fact
that the frosh game went over-
time as the fact that the frosh
game, too, was started late.

And, as a ﬁnal suggestion, to
the vic operators — why not
let the dancers know when a
particular dance is over? Some
people are systematic enough to
get dates during the evening,
and they like to know when the
dances are coming. Nuff saidl

Freshmen Revive Good Old Days

In Discussion About Traditions

0

 

Back in your good old freshman
days when you were busily engaged
in signing up for Myskania, did you
ever stop to wonder just how this
organization began? And while you
were tearing across the campus to
your 8:10 math. class did you ever
bait and ponder over the rules which
made it illegal for you to be doing
just that? No, you didn'tl And so
you went your own sweet way, ut-
terly ignorant of State's most inter-
esting traditions — And mebbe you
lived happly ever after.

But not the class of ’42! This year's
crop of kiddies have done something
to be proud of. Last Thursday,
Freshman commission sponsored a
panel discussion on “State College
Traditions"—-and more fun, more
laughs, more people killed!

Did you know that long, long ago
the fresh were not allowed to sport
moustaches because such decorations
were thought to give them too much
prestige? Did you know that Dr.
Scotland, as a freshman, was forced
to put up her hair instead of wear-
ing it in pigtails~and that in the
process of being initiated, she was
given the pleasure of rolling a pencil
up the ﬂoor of the old auditorium
(now the library) with her nose as
her only weapon?

Are you aware of the fact that
Miss Wallace of cilr Latin Depart-
ment was a member of our ﬁrst Mys-
kania? And that formerly this stu-
dent honorary society chose its
members by letting the entire junior
class march across the stage while
the chosen i‘ew were “grabbed” as
they tripped by? — A procedure
which took only ten and and I do
mean ten minutes! Did you know
that Minerva was bought with “blood
money"? Yes, each student who
took a re-examination in any sub-
ject had to contribute one dollar to-
ward the purchase of that fair lady.
Also, the rule which prohibits fresh-
men from sitting in the rotunda was
made in her honor after she had
been rescued from a ﬁre in one of
the other buildings where she
formerly stood

And that's not all. Dr. Beaver told
tales of them thar days when, in
place of banner rivalry, each class
strove, on Moving-up day to place
its own colors in the highest possible
spot in or on the buildings and keep
the colors of the other classes down.
And when such procedure began to
cause ﬁghts on the roofs, the ad-
ministration lllnited' the hiding of
colors to the trees!

Did your junior advisers ever tell
you these things? No they didn't!
But fresh commission told the
freshmen—~und how!

In keeping with the excellent pro-
mm laid out for State’s men this
year under the able leadership of
Duke Hersh and Larry Strattncr,
there comes a sadly needed man
into the realms of boxing as she
is practiced.

The need of a coach was evident,
for full development and proficiency
in this sport requires more capable
handling than the usual run of ath—
letics.

A note from Dan Bucci regarding
this new personage was received the
other day:

“Intromurai’s boxing instructor is
quite a capable fellow. He was born
in Scotland as Robert Winter, but
is commonly called Scotty.

“Scotty received his education in
Scotland and England, and during
his ﬁrst six months here won 28
of 29 ﬁghts. Among his opponents
and some victims are such top-
notchers as Tommy Romano,
Frankie Clark, Honeyboy Hughes,
and Tony Canzoneri, the latter,
former 135-1b, champ and the fore-
most of all first ranking challengers.

“Scotty” is teaching a music class,
taking after his dad who also teaches
music in Cliatham high school.

“Prior to his instruction here.
Scotty, a former Golden Glove
champ, coached boxing at C.B.A.
with great success.

“We believe we are indeed for-
tunate in getting him to teach the
boys, for he is certainly getting bet-
ter results and longer classes each
Monday and Wednesday afternoon
in the Commons and at the same
time giving hangers-on quite a free
show, So here's hoping for a big-
ger turnout—and good luck, Scotty!”

We were a little aghast when We
watched the actions of the fresh
squad last Friday night. Five men—
Brauner, Scott, Dixon, Merritt, and
Hilton —- showed more cooperation
and teamwork than we've seen in a
three-year stretch of fresh squads.

Each man has his own unique
starring points, but the way that.
the points added up to one neat
quintet, was remarkable. Nothing
was actually individual that was not
worked in for the beneﬁt of the
squad.

Even though no man could be
singled out as the star of the action,
it seemed that any one of the start-
ing lineup could be a star on any
man‘s quintet.

So, to freshmen squad members,
We direct a heartfelt wish that the
teamwork would continue and the
even more hardy advice not to get
heady if things don't break right.
Someday, we'd like to count the
number of teams that. fall apart
because they thought they knew how
they werewwhen We have a few
years to spare.

Speaking of teamwork, We'd like
to throw all the orchids Rockefeller
could buy III the direction of the
varsity quintet, which went to town
in the second half ol' the Connec-
ticut state win.

The net impression ot‘ watching
the whole five men ili notion was
that We were seeing one of the driest
working aggregations iii as long as
We can remember.

Despite the strength of the MeGlll.

STATE COLLEGE NEWS, JANUARY 13, 1939

State Owls to Meet Strong McGill,

Hartwick S

 

 

Squad Will Meet Niagara
Wednesday in Contest
on Local Court

Fresh from a 50-43 victory over
Connecticut State Teachers last Fri-
day night, the State Owls are pre-
paring for a tough weekend that
won't ﬁnish until next Wednesday
night, Tonight State will encounter
McGill university on Page court, to-
morrow night the team travels to
Oneonta to square off against Hart—
wick, and Wednesday we face Niag-
ara university here.

These three games will be beauties
because every one of the teams is
having a very successful season. Mc-
Gill, on her last trip south, whaled
Union by a margin of more than ten
pollits and has a strong outﬁt spec-
ializing in long shots.

Hartwick, according to latest re-
ports, has won ﬁve games and
dropped one. Included in the vic-
tory column is a startling upset of a
St. Lawrence team that carried
Fordham to an overtime period in

New York city before losing the con- t

test. Hartwick has been practicing
this year to the tune of various
swing bands and has shuffled over
all opposition so far. The Owls will
attempt to slow that jazz to a Vien-
nese waltz.

Niagara has come up with an-
other powerful quintet. Last week-
end the upstaters snapped a seven-
teen—game winning streak of St.
Bonaventure's by a one point victory
over the club. Upperclassmcn will
remember a few years back when a
strong State team led Niagara for
the entire game only to crack in the
last few minutes and lose out in the
stretch. Niagara was the class of
the state that year, playing in the
Madison Square Garden tournament
against the cream of the East and
West. This year she Will solid a
team with plenty on the ball to lnake
things interesting for the State var-
sity and its supporters.

Brauner, Scott Lead Attack;
Team to Meet Hartwick
Tomorrow Night

 

Combliiing sparkling offense with
an almost impenetrable defense, the
State college freshmen slaughtered
the Cobleskill Aggies, 39-19, in the
Page gym last Friday night. It was the
type of game that has been expected
from the fresh for quite a time but
which has just. been realized.

State college won as it pleased,
with Brauner and Scott leading the
attack. The Aggies were swept off
the court. in the ﬁrst quarter. Coach
Hersh started his first team and at
the end of the period, the score stood

second team was inserted at the
start of the second quarter, Coble-
skill rallied enough to tally six more
points before the half ended, but
State led by ten points.

The second half became more of
a rout. Passing brilliantly and
handling the ball deftly, State
amassed twenty-two more points to
win ﬁnally by 39—19.

State's defense was too much i'or
the Coblcskill team. Sticking close
to their men, the freshmen bottled
up any offensive attempts of the
visitors. The Aggies had to shoot at
‘random and never were any of its
lplayers balanced or set in taking

Purple and Gold Defeat
Connecticut State Five
by 50-43 Tally

by Joe Bosley

The State College Owls scored an
exciting triumph over a classy Con-
necticut State outﬁt last Friday
night on the local court. The ﬁnal
score was 50-43. The contest was
one of the fastest ever played on the
Page court. The ball sailed back
and forth so rapidly that heads
bobbed around as if they were
watching a tennis match.

Coach Hatﬁeld started his second
squad against Connecticut State and
carefully instructed his regulars as
he watched the opponents' offensive
and defensive formations. It was a
smart move because very little was
known about the Connecticut quin-
tet. However, the New Englanders
had an ace in the bole~ﬁve of them,
in fact. After the starting ﬁve, com-
posed of rangy lads, had shot it;
bolt, the coach sent in a squad of
fast, tough lads to do their dirt. This
team played an entirely cliﬁerenl:
style—every man had an eye like a
hawk on a set shot.

Hersh, Framcnt, Simmons, Leh-
man, Ellerin, and Amyot bore the
brunt of the attack through the
worst of the game, and with two
complete teams alternating against
them, they had a tough job.

Trailing by one point at the half,
State unleashed a savage drive that
carried them into the lead at the
beginning of the third quarter. The
lead changed hands continually un-
til with about seven minutes of the
contest left, the Owls grabbed an
advantage which they never relin-
quisbed.

A big bouquet goes to Walt Sim—
mons; he played a swell game. He
scored thirteen points to lead the
offense and fought his heart out on
the defense; even when he was ob-
viously out on his feet from the
punishment, he kept driving.

Will Framan was in there plug-
ging all the time. Every time some-
thing hit the ﬂoor, it was Franient
right after that ball. He also con-
tributed ten points to State's total.

Ellcrin and Amyot did a mighty
fine job with their shots. Set hoavcs
by those two lads seemed to come at
a time when the team was some-
what discouraged. They perkcd the
squad up continually by tying the
score or handing State the lead.

Captain Duke Hersh played his
usually swell defensive game. Duke

and he doesn‘t get too lnuch credit
for it. He and Simmons were stal-
warts under the blinkbonrd. Duke
also livened the contest by engaging
in a brief bran with some noive
ind who doesn't realize yet how for-
tunate be is. Duke showed swell
sportsmanship when he soaked up a
punch in the face from a smaller
man and didn‘t clout him a couple
of times.
