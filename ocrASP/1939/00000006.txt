Commentstater

(THE COMMENTSTATER is given the widest
latitude as author of this column. though his view-
points do not necessarily always reﬂect those of the
STATE COLLEGE News.)

With a ﬂurry of comments, critical and complimen-
tary, this half of the Commentstater bowe out. We hate
to think that this is the last time we shall "take pen
in hand” for a round or two with the affairs of State.
but next semester a new, and probably fresher batch
of comments will be thrown at you, and We want to
take this opportunity to wish the new Commentstater
good luck. Our fervent hope is that he will ﬁnd less
evils and more bouquets.

The prize incident of the week took place in Hart-
wick where a irate Hartwicklan told our capable
basketball manager that maybe he didn’t have as good
an intellect as “you people from State,” but he did
want his rights. What a reputation. It’s almost as
good as the comments that the feature story on the
ideal Man of State in last week's issue of this papcr

: evoked. The local press commented upon it profusely,
Chimes Walsh and we hear that they think the author had set ills
standards too high for the average layman. Howcvcr.

PLAYGOER

Frankly, we weren’t too impressed
by last Tuesday’s presentations. We
don’t mean that the plays offered
weren’t well-done, They were—but
it seemed to us that there was a
mechanical perfection that pervaded
the entire group of plays, destroy-
ing all attempt of the actors to
catch that spark of enthusiasm and
spontaneity which can so often make
a poor play great.

Personal
Viewpoints

(EGO is given the widest lati-
tude as author of this column,
though his viewpoints do not
necessarily always reflect those
of the STATE Council News.)

In the course of events we
must meet some unpleasant
things and so the semi-annual
examinations sends us into our
usual dither. And so the new
system relieves the pressure a
bit at this time. We really would
like to know what happens if we
flunk fearfully in June. We
won't worry about that however
until We do—or at least until We
will. Involved—eh what?

This last semester has been
gruelling to everyone in the ac-
tivities office because of the al-
most dcnse population of the
place. We wonder why the ac-
tivities heads don’t lock the
place up. We would. The pcoplc
who have work to do on an
activity can't ﬁnd a typcwrilor

We were a little bit disgusted
with the case with which R.P.l.
registered a 40-16 win over McGill
Saturday night, after the close and
nerve-wracking thriller of the night
before, in which McGill took the
Owls by a one point margin.

Mislap, Purdee, and Kingston, who
took in thirty-two of the points
which the Toronto team registered
Friday night, were held, respectively,
to six, two, and four points in the
R.P.I. event.

All of which seems to indicate
that R.P.I. must have something.
The McGill lads oﬂ‘crcd Just about

So the pre-exam lull has set in
(or should we say the pre-pre-exam
lull is continuing?) and athletics are
languishing —- advancing rapidly
backwards.

Because of the deficiency of
snow——have we mentioned that be-
foret—snow sports seem to be
limited to one, ice skating. And of
course you realize that technically
ice skating isn’t a snow sport! But
technicalities are neither here nor
there, The ice in Washington park
lake is embellished with numerous
addition problems and autographs,
with hole and there an occasional
crevasse, commemorating minor cas-
ualties. As for other snow sports.
