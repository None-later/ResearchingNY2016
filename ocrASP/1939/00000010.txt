Reggie, Childs, String Maestro,
Has Brilliant Musical Career

 

A band of national repute, four-
teen artists producing sweet swing
on the Hal Kemp side; a genial
maestro with a successful career be-
hind him; Jimmy De Palma, fea-
tured vocalist; entertainment by
"Perky" and “Pops” Carrol, comedy
singers;—all this the junior class
will offer to the students of State
college tonight at the annual Junior
Prom.

Standing out, of course, from this
array of talent, is Reggie Childs, the
violin-playing maestro, whose band
at the present time is one of the
top-notchers in the sweet swing di-
vision of dance bands. Born in
America and raised in England, he
received his musical education in the
conservatories of London and Paris.
Starting out as a cello player, Childs
aspired to be a symphony soloist.
Later, he pursued a course of study
on the violin and after having mas-
tered this instrument. decided to
devote his talent to the radio and
dance orchestra fields.

Returning to New York, Childs
ﬂrst-violined for seVeral leading
dance orchestras and began to di-
rect musical productions. Included
among these was, “Little Jesse
James” from which his theme song,
“I Love You.” was taken.

Next, forming a new dance band,
Childs opened at the San Diego
Country club, and engagements fol-
lowed at the Roosevelt hotel in New
York city for three years. the Essex
house in Newark. the Commodore
Perry hotel in Toledo and other fa—
mous night spots. All these aided
Childs in his rapid rise to fame.

To Have Seminar

The ﬁrst meeting of debate semi-
nar for members of the freshman
debate squad was conducted by
Leonard Friedlander. ’39, yesterday
afternoon in room 28. This meet-
ing of the seminar is but one of a
series arranged by Mr. Louis C.
Jones. instructor in English and

These freshman seminars are to be
conducted along lines similar to
those employed by varsity debaters.
Meetings will be conducted every
Thursday at 4:00 o'clock in room
28 with a member of the varsity
in charge. Here, the freshmen will
be given an opportunity to thrash
out the various debate topics and
aid in compiling a bibliography.
forming issues, and debate technique
will be given. For the most part,
the following debate question will
,be emphasized: “Resolved, that the
United States should establish an
alliance with Great Britain."

The next two meetings of this
seminar will be presided over by
Betty Hayford and Richard Lons-
All members of the
debate squad are ex-

 

 

to the styles of Hal Kemp and Shep pected to attend these meetings.

Fields. Jitterbugs also have a chance
to do their stuff, for Childs alter-
nates his sweet music with lukewarm
swing arrangements. Sweet music,
however, predominates.

Childs comes to State directly
from a long engagement at the Ben-
jamin Franklin hotel in Philadelphia

where he has aired frequently over;

NBC networks.
