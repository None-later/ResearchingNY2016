When play was moving slowly
in the jittei'bug struggle last week-
end. we learned a lot about how to
take basketball from the comments

roaring out from the llartwick
bench.
First, there was t iie ordinary

Iroquois Warrior cry which has its
derivation from the aticient battle
cries of the tribe from which the
Hartwick squad chose its nickname,
Said war—whoops usually resolved
themselves into “Don‘t let him get.
away with that" or sometimes, the
more subtle “Sit on that guy.“
Then, there was the essence of
cricsvthat issuing from the medi-
cine man himself It seems that.
whenever the coach thinks that the
other team has some valuable play-
ers and these players have a few
fouls ‘allcd against them, it is cs-
sential for the well-being of onc's
owr. squad to :alt over to the scorer

“How abottt cttrtaiiis for him?" at‘
each new fotti committed, Wcll.
Coach Johnson, We suppose that

there's nothing like being a hypo-
crite.

’l‘he jittcrbug complex seems to
have given a any to a bit of serious-
ness. if the lack of demonstrations in
last Friday‘s game 'an be taken as
an indication.
nant was a cheer which, being very
opportune, as well as aptly phrased,
just plain hurt:

“Otir score's tip
Their scorc's down
Come on Hai‘twlck,
Trttck on down."

And which. being accompanied by

a neat bit of trucking from

high as the brunctt' iii the third
row of the Hartwick cheering section.

As we write this little epitaph on
commuter spirit, we cast our eyes
downi'ard, for We have aitlctl the
death, we suppose, by substituting
when the commuters. as usual,
showed up for basketball games with
insufficient players.

We can rationalise our own posi—
tion by ttotitig llic facl. that as a
commuter. wc sitnply hclpcd ottt tilt
when the full blooded mcntbcrs of
our tribe \vcrc not in evidence. de-
spite our oatii til allegiance to an-
other sqttad. Now, with us out of
the way. we should like to call the
coinmutct"s attention to thc llll-
latidalilc situation which exists.
Since tltc first intramural game of
the season. the commuters have had
to forfcit tlllitilllt'illllyi cvcry gatiic.

We should like to sllggcsl to Larry
