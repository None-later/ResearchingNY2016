C. F. F.

When play was moving slowly
in the jitterbug struggle last week-
end. we learned a lot about how to
take basketball from the comments

roaring out from the Hartwlck
bench.
First, there was the ordinary

Iroquois Warrior cry which has its
derivation from the ancient battle
cries of the tribe from which the
Hartwick squad chose its nickname.
Said war-whoops usually resolved
themselves into “Don’t let him get
away with that" or sometimes, the
more subtle “Sit on that guy.”

Then, there was the essence of
cries—that issuing from the medi-
cine man himself. It seems that.
whenever the coach thinks that the
other team has some valuable play-
ers and these players have a few
fouls called against them, it is es-
sential for the well-being of one's
own squad to call over to the scorer
“How about curtains for him?" at
each new foul committed. Well,
Coach Johnson, we suppose that
there's nothing like being a hypo-
crite.

The jitterbug complex seems to
have given away to a bit of serious-
ness. if the lack of demonstrations in
last Friday's game can be taken 
an indication. About the only rem-
nant was a cheer which, being very
opportune, as well as aptly phrased.
just plain hurt:

“Our score's up
Their score’s down
Come on Hartwick,
Truck on down."

And which. being accompanied by
a neat bit of trucking from three
tricky cheerleaders. rates almost as
high as the brunette in the third
row of the Hartwick cheering section.

As we write this little epitaph on
commuter spirit. we cast our eyes
downward. for We have aided the
death, we suppose, by substituting
when the commuters. as usual,
showed up for basketball games with
insufficient players.

We can rationalize our own posi-
tion by noting the fact. that as a
commuter, we simply helped out (’1’)
when the full blooded members of
our tribe were not in evidence, de-
spite our oath of allegiance to an-
other squad. Now, with us out of
the way, We should like to call the
commuter’s attention to the un-
laudablc situation which exists.
Since the first intramural game of
the season. the commuters have had
to forfeit tunofficiallyl every game.

We should like to suggest to Larry
Strattncr that the commuters be
dropped as a competitive unit unless
at least five men can be found who
will be on hand when games are
to be played.

The Commuters came through
Tuesday night. despite the thought-
ful misplaccmcnt of referee, ‘imc-
keeper and scorer by MAA. The
first win (over Albany) was dis-
credited on tWo counts this time,
lack of officials adding to lack of
eligible players.

We have been warned by the
Alumni day committee that Alumni
day does not concern undergrad-
uates. but despite the warning, we
feel that this day. which will be.-
come more and more important in
the future. is of interest to all of
us as future graduates.

The date has been set, this year,
on the day of the, R.P.l. fracas.
The program will start at 2:00
o'clock in the afternoon and will
include basketball, boxing, wrestling,
ping pong. badminton, bull session,
cnttsrtainment, etc. it will be capped
by a luncheon and free admittanct
to the lt.l’.l. game that night.

The entire program Will be for
the benefit of grads alone, with
Walko about as general chairman
and bouncer-for-precocious—under-
grads.

Assisting Michael in the grad work
will be léld Melnnson and .lhnmy
Maloucy, in charge of publicity and
the bullet luncheon and liill l-lopkc.
as chairman of arrangements com-
mittcc. which also includes Lou
Greenspan, Jim Chapell, and Doug
Rector.

We hope that the day will help re-
vive that Alumni spirit which has
waned of late. Pity that such a
remarkable thing should fail!

College House Loses
To Graduate Quintet

Avalon-Spencer Surprises Potter
Club in 37-23 Win

College house was ﬁnally toppled
from the ranks of unbeaten teams
by a pOWerful outfit composed of
Grads in Page hall last Thursday.
The score was 43—21. Avalon-
Spencer blossomed forth with a last
quarter rally to defeat Potter club,
37-23.

There was little doubt as to the
superiority of the grads. In every
department of the game, they ex-
hibited skill and technique. They
scored on a large percentage of their
shots and presented a well-oiled of-
fense and air-tight defense.

Bill Simpson led the grad scorers
with 12 points, all made in the sec-
ond half. Charlie Wiberly was close
behind with 10. while Carney was
high man for the College house,
scoring 7. Incidentally, John Edge,
College house's high scorer, was held
to a single ﬁeld basket.

Potter club looked Well on the
way to another victory as they led
Avalon-Spencer 19-15 at half time.
At the beginning of the third quar-
ter. Avalon-Spencer made ten points
in a row before Potter club scored.
They continued to pick—up momen-
tum, to win going away, 37-23. . . .
Les Gerdts was again high man for
his club. scoring 13 points. Gaffney
led Potter Club with 10.

Owls Suffer Sixth Defeat
Aillartwick Wins 46-33

 

Collapses as Warriors
Gain Early Lead

VICTORS LEAD AT HALF

Fray Tonight Pits Varsity
Against St. Michael’s
on Page Court

Last Friday, Hartwick's Iroquois
warriors ended a four game losing
streak by taking an easy 46-33 con-
test from our own low flying Owls.

The warriors took an early lead
under some neat hooping by Bois-
vert and Mulligan. whose non-re-
sisted efforts gained a nine point
tally to oppose the single foul point
netted by Torrens before the State
squad broke into the ﬁeld goal col-
umn.

The eight point advantage was
closely guarded throughout the first
half with the warriors holding the
ball in a slow bucket offense until
they could break the determined. but
not so effective, defense of the Peds.

The offense of the State five was
an adequate accompaniment to the
defense with State losing the ball
constantly whenever they Were with-
in striking distance of the hoop. and
ending the half on the short end
of a 14-24 setup.

The second half witnessed still
more determined and futile en-
cleavors by the Owls. With Mar-
tuscello and Dascomb continuing on
the merry highroad for the victors
the closest that the Page hall boys
could come was within seven points,
midway through the half,

Walko "Save" Fails

Lehman and Walko led the State
squad with ten and nine points.
Walko, who substituted early for
Herle was for a moment the hope
of a flailing team when he turned
in a neat bit of support, by scor-
ing cleanly and frequently with
longs and half bolstering the flail-
ing defense.

The State squad is at present on
the losing t'dge of the ledger, with
a six-loss. five-win record. Wins over
both St. Michael's and R.P.I. must
be effected to end up the season
above the .500 level.

Saints Are Opponents

St. Michael's will be met tonight
in Page hall, as the prelin'iinary to
the home game with R.P.I. next
Saturday night.

The Saints will bill a well-experi-
enccd quintet, with five senior let-
tcrmen returned from last year's
squad. The game will terminate a
three day schedule for the Winooskl

main game.

In a game that saw the score see-
saw back and forth several times.
the Albany Business college basket-
ball team tripped State freshmen
by a 27-26 score in the Page gym
last Friday night.

Squad Misses Scott

Although the fresh had their ori-
ginal starting lineup, which, inci-
dentally was a distinct surprise
because the injured Scott and Leh-
man entered the fracas, they were
unable to come through with a vic-
tory. Virgil Scott, the team’s ace
scorer was considerably handicapped
by his injured ankle. At no time
did he resemble the Scott of the
previous contests.

Despite this fact, the play was
centered about him as usual, The
defeat of the frosh cannot be at-
tributed in total to the injury of
Scott. for the entire team played in
streaks. At times they clicked in
every department and on other oc-
casions they failed miserably. Their
pass work, especially, was spotty.

ABC, as always, featured its at-
tack around Finnegan. their consis-
tently high scorer. He was at the
right place most of the time.

Dickson Features

Dickson and Scott led the frosh
attack in the first half in a slow-
brcaking offense which penetrated
the A.B.C.'s squad’s efforts up to a
16-14 half time lead. Dickson netted
six points. while Scott followed close

B. C.

A trifle less than a year ago we
said something or other about the
probability of Camp Johnston hi-
jackers embarking on a BIG en-
terprise; viz: carrying away the
camp in its entirety. Well—our little
light-ﬁngered (and much-muscled)
friends are apparently getting into
training in order to fulfill our
prognostication a year after it was
made. The latest reports from the
Chatham front state that the most
recent article to be spirited away
from camp is a double-sized inner
spring mattress!

Anticipating that the enemy will
make the ﬁnal attack sometime
within the next month, Lotta
Bunkers, in a body, has initiated
shrewd strategies to outwit the
thieves. Sympathetic C h a t h a m
neighbors by the score have been
enlisted as a vigilante committee
to stand a constant watch over the
camp. State Troopers Muidoch and
Chuldemoquoddelly have agreed to

commute between the Troop XXX

headquarters and Chatham, keeping
a watchful eye on the place and
waiting for things to POPIl W.A.A.
council has approved a rush order
to the Sta-Stuk Anchor Company
for four extra-size anchors to be
attached to each corner of the cabin.
The company representative has
guaranteed that only a six-tractor
team would be able to wiggle the
corner-stones.

And while all these frenzied pre-
cautions are being taken. amateur
and professional sleuths are tracing
various clues and “expect an arrest
within twenty-four hours." One of
the detectives said that from the
clues of an overturned sugar bowl,
a piece of a jig—saw puzzle and a
man's small footprint, he had de-
duced that the thief was asmall man
with a penchant for sweets and jig-
saw puzzles. (Sounds to us like any~
body's li’l brother; or three guys: a
little one—the brains, one who has
a sweet-tooth, and another who goes
for THOSE puzzles. But we have
been wrong. and if aforesaid detec-
tive ﬁnds the dolty tief and re-
covers the mattress-—why, he was
right i) * * '

Pertinent to nothing whatever in
the preceding bit, may we take a
quiet little poke at the Bulletin
Board—you know, that brown space
across from “where the mailboxes
used to be.” All that can be said
for it is that it suffices. Like the
hat rack in most front hails. it's a
sWell place to hang things, and let
them hang and hang and hang.
And that's no sort of an act for
any bulletin board to be wasting
its time doing.

A. A. bulletin board is very nearly
the only publicity agent which the
association has to contact the un-
initiated general public—an’ it ain’t
makln' much of an impression!

As aids in correcting this diffi-
culty we suggest a bulletin board
consistently displaying color and
originality combined with some
pleasing or systematic arrange-
rment of notices and posters.
