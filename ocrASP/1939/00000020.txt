Seniors remember undoubtedly the storm center
of student asst-triblies our freshman year: the revi-
sion of thc l’oint System. No Nazi littnd meeting
was more Consistently heckled or more ardcntly de-
bated, htit the storm has subsided! Not only has
the committee been dormant this year: to all in
tents antl purposes. it ltas been non-existent.

it was obvious carelessness when the present
chairman was never notit'ietl oi the metnbers of his
committee. He became automatically a head "sine
corpore." and the work oi the toniniittec was ‘
neglerted. .-\t'tording to the regulations passed by
the Student assembly. the point >_\"lt'|ll is to he
enforced by Student council. after violations are
reported by the torrtmittee. Since there was no
committee. no \iolirtions were reported. and no
cniorccments were tirade. (Jill).

Administration Assignments

 

 

- Commentstater

We were bull sessioning it the other eve. and from
that gab fest there came a good idea. we think. Why.
when the entering freshmen come here to be inter-
viewed. doesn't a committee of two or three seniors
and juniors take them to ltinch in the “Boul” or
cafeteria. and let this committee report on their reac-
tions, just as the faculty committees do? By this
means any complete social misfits could be barred
more certainly than they might be by the faculty
committees. which. of necessity. must have a bit of a
barrier between themselves and the newcomer.

A student committee would also be of invaluable
aid to the junior guide system. because these students
would have deﬁnite facts to work with. and they
would not need to spend the first few days ﬁnding
out the interests of the fresh.

Of course. the problem that arises is how to pick
such a student. group. that would not have as primary
interests those of ti fraternity or sorority. Frankly.
that ntariy stumps its. bttt We believe that. by care—
i‘ui choice. insuring fair representation and balance.
the Dean of Students' ott'ice could accomplish this
task.

And. even it' at times this organization spirit does
overcome the committee. we still believe that the
students are able to weed ottt the chaff, and the
student body would be correspondingly improved. To
be sure. in a few eases the student committee's opin-
ioti might tlitt'nr widely from that of the t'nculty ('tilll-
inittee. bitt iii .sticlt a case we believe that the adr-
tnntistrution sltottltl detide.

Well. well. and well! Alter a stormy renewal oi

setting the new M'lltt'hici‘ lli order. the plays oi lust

conclusively that a little thought grit-n to staging
will not be inopporttine.

COMMUNICATIONS

tDear Editor:

We have long been proud of the

democratic procedure which prevails
in our Student association govern-
ment. There are few colleges which
can boast of the free. student-con-
trolled assemblies that we have; few
have as democratic election proce-
dure as We do. However. the non-
secret ballot still remains a practice
which can nullify all of the demo—
‘craiie safeguards which our consti-
tution provides for. The secret
ballot has been established by long
[practice as a nect‘ssary part of any
democratic system. Everyone, I
think, agrees that a secret ballot
its beneficial and necessary m the
.‘tnajor problem has been to find a
isystetn which will be really secret
and which will get otit as many
voters as our present system does.
without danger of fraud and vote
.stealing.
i There are several methods by
which this can be achieved. none
of which can fully be discussed here.
Probably the best met'iod would be
by voting machines which eottld
probably be rented from the city of
Albany. If this is impossible. a
system whereby each voter stuns his
littltic before receiving his ballot in
i1 procedure similar to registration
for state and national elections
wriild bn used. Myslciinia would
act as air election board and provide
for a tll>illti'ii\'i' seal or stamp for
each ballot. ro that they could not
be clipictl. There are marry other
"\‘lt'llis which would undotibtcdty
work a: WP”.

l Campus activities have been cur-
itailed somewhat this past week by
San epidemic of colds. Junior Week-
end was perhaps too big a success.
However much we regret the ab—
tsence of so many friends. We do ap-
lpreciate their public-mindedness in
iconl‘ining themselves and their
‘gcrins.

I The rumors we hear of an All-
state Tea Dance sound intriguing.

‘a vague supposition to an actual-
ity. The grand old seniors are be—
hind it, and. if for no other reason,

~ause they Hit' the grand old seniors.
