Delhi Five, 40-21

Engineer Freshman Quintet
to Face Frosh Squad
Tomorrow Night

 

The Delhi Aggies, who have suf-
fered set backs at the hands of
New Paltz, A.B.C.. Cobleskiil. Al-
l‘red Aggies. and Caulton. sank
deeper into the loss column last; Fri-
day night when they were swamped
by the. State freshmen, 40-21.

The victory was clear cut and
never was the otttcome of the con-
test in doubt. Leading 19-11 at
half time. the frosh rettirned and
applied more pressure to win out by
to to 21.

In spite of the impressive score,
the game was marred by some
gagged play. The passing. ball

the players- was intermittently bad.
However. much of the bad ball
handling can be attributed to poor
timing of the athletes in cutting in
