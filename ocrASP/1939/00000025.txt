C. I". F.

The interest of the R.P.I. boys
in their team is brought out by
this little story going the rounds
of the Trojan camp.

It seems that with each new win
throughout the current season, the
enthusiastic supporters were in the
habit of marking a big, black score
after the Varsity schedule on a
prominently displayed bulletin board.
Came the Union game—the first loss
of the Engineers—and some venture—
some lad simply added the term
“N.S.E.” after the listing on the
board, in small red letters.

Now. “N.S.E." doesn‘t mean much
to the average Statesmen, but its
significance is brought out from its
usage in R.P.I.'s marking system.
Whenever a prof is in doubt as to
deciding whether a student pass or
fail a course (corresponding in mood
to our profs who give a C—— or a
DWI—i the mark N.S.E. is given. Such
a mark entitles the student to an—
other chance at the exam—having
been "Not Sufficiently Examined.”

The REL-State rivalry which
holds prime interest pro tein, goes
much farther back than any mate-
rial which we could ﬁnd led us to
suspect.

Coach Donald has recently com—
pleted a history of sports at R.P.I.
for which he gathered material from
a number of sources, including city
newspaper ﬁles, fraternity scrap-
books, and RBI. publications. ill a
cross - checked - for - accuracy tome
that embraces a fairly complete pic-
ture of varsity teams back through
the beginning of the century.

By simply thumbing through an
index, we came to the record of
State engagements. The listing gives
R.P.I. twenty-four victories out of
thirty-four games, with State taking
nine battles and one game tied.

The history, an interesting volume
in itself, includes such items as
schedules faced by opponents each
year, box scores of each R.P.[. game,
each year, four letter men way back
when. three letter men not so far
back when, etc.. and took Coach

Head Off Vermont Rally;
Walko, High Man

by Joseph Bosley

St. Michael’s quintet blew into
town last Friday night, and trailed
out with a 40-36 licking plastered
on their record, The game was ter-
rific in more ways than one; for a
while it looked as if State was go-
ing to boot this one into the enemy
camp.

State elected to kick off in the
first half, and they certainly did

the ball, themselves, and everything
else in sight; the only respectable
thing about the first half was the
score, 13-11, a respectable football
score.

State Mui‘fs Lead

In the second half, however, both
teams flashed brilliant form at
times. St. Michael's oflense seemed
:10 click more smoothly but the
iO\vls‘ defense was concrete most of
;the time, State took over a size-
gable lead after St. Mike's run them—
'selvcs ragged, and held on until
there was about five minutes left
of the contest. The lead faded like
a practice teacher's smile, allowing
the Saints to climb to a tie score at
36 all. State rooters began to tear
up their lesson plans and kiss the
game goodbye. The boys came back
gallantly with two rapid goals and
froze the ball to end the game on the
long and of the score.

St. Michael’s lost the game mid-
way in the second half when, after
flashing a nice passing attack. they
crowded their luck too far. They
began firing passes aimed for the
green pastures of Vermont. Failing
to bounce the ball from the bleach-
ers into the basket, they attempted
to toss it into the center lane, which
was adequately guarded by such
men of size as Simmons. Hersh, Leh-
nail. and Walko.

Fouls Count

Incidentally. the foul lane was
like No-Man‘s Land to the Ver—
mentors. 'I‘hcy sank but four fouls
during the entire contest, One lad
misscd five or more to show the way.

The possibilities of a Union frosh—

y‘ar are becoming definitely on
the probability side. Watch for an
armounccnicnt of such a game in
the near future. (We hope!)

The spotty teamwork which State
has shown throughout the season
polls the hope of a win tomorrow
night. Showing only flashcs of the
real work which We thought. at the
beginning of the scaron. should
charm-tcrizc our squad. (examples:

For the second straight week, Mike

ord to six victories and six defeats.

Engineer Freshman Quintet
to Face Froeh Squad
Tomorrow Night

The Delhi Aggles, who have suf-
fered set backs at the hands of
New Paltz, A.B.C., Cobleskill. Al-
fred Aggies, and Caulton, sank
deeper into the loss column last Fri.
day night when they were swamped
by the State freshmen, 40-21.

The victory was clear cut and
never was the outcome of the con-
test in doubt. Leading 19-11 at
half time, the frosh returned and
applied more pressure to win out by
40 to 21.

In spite of the impressive score,
the game was marred by some
ragged play. The passing, ball
handling, and general floor work of
the players was intermittently bad.
However, much of the bad ball
handling can be attributed to poor
timing of the athletes in cutting in
from one position to another.

Tomorrow night at 7:30 o’clock, a
powerful and highly-touted R.P.I.
freshman quintet plays the State
frosh in the Page hall gymnasium.
On the Engineer squad are four local
lads: German. Gardner, Symanski,
and Game. The latter is a product
of Milne High school. The former
three have seen little service, because
they are above the age ruled by the
state for competition against high
school teams.

R.P.I.'s yearlings have won six
games, defeating State frosh 25-23,
Albany Academy 28-19, Watervliet
32—22, Cohoes 31-22, Waterford 42-15,
Union frosh 43-25, and have lost
one to Mont Pleasant, 18-40.

up is  follows:

Alas, poor ping-pong is no longer
with us. Like the girl in the song,
it just “up and died." But not from
the usual natural cause of look of
general interest on the part of incin-
bers of the association! This sport
-was condemned to death! The

powers that be decreed that equip-
ment is too old and rickety to with-
stand the vigorous workouts which
the paddle artistes no doubt give it;
further, they decreed that there isn't
cnough equipment iof any vintage)
to mch the demands of the num-
.-rous rabid enthusiasts.

Of course. as a solution to the
.problem, it was suggested that ping-
pong played in the Commons and
'lu group houses could be offered for
credit, This was thumbcd down on
the grounds that the awarding of
credit for unsupervised activity
would create an unfortunate pre-
feedenl.

1 However. since so much interest
,has been shown in the sport, ping-
pong will undoubtedly be resur-
'rcctcd next year, probably during
this same season, by which time
