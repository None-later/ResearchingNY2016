Library Exhibit Case Discloses
Interesting Hobbies of Faculty

"'— 4?

As you’ve walked up to the stair’s
leading to the library, you haVe
probably noticed standing alongside
the railin'g a glass-inclosed case.
Even more probably, you have
stepped over for a moment to look
into the case, for it is there that
have been housed the many library
exhibits that have for the past few
years caught and held the attention
of State college students.

The exhibit case has been party
of the library since 1934 when the
new library was equipped. It is
Miss Helen James, librarian, who
plans the exhibits, gathers together,
and, for the most part, arranges
the material. Arts, crafts, and hob-
bies, particularly, have been subjects
of display.

It would be impossible to describe
all the displays sinc‘e 1934, but just
consider these as representative.

1934 Russian arts and crafts—the
first exhibit.

1935 Old New York State Normal
diplomas—back to 1847.

1936 Coronation material - col-
lected by Dr. Candlyn.

1937 Relics of ancient civilizations
of South America — lent by Dr.

Specially commented upon for its
beauty and interest is the latest ex-
hibit of Jugoslavlan fabric designs
contributed by Miss Ruth E, Hutch-

The costume designs were sketched
by Miss Hutchins while working in
the Ethnographicai museum in Za-
greb, Jugoslavia.

VarIOUS exhibits haVe also revealed
hobbies of several members of our
faculty. Dr, South, for example, has
a valuable collection of American
glass and China. Miss Moreland,
while traveling through Russia,
gathered together Russian peasant
dolls. Dr. Morris has contributed her
collections of bookplates, and Mr.
Jones, interested in James Joyce, has
made the collection of material on
that man his hobby.

Seniors Debate
Freshmen Today
On Guidance Plan

Forensic Members to Discuss
Chicago Education Plan
During Assembly

 

The second in a series of three
intramural debates for possession of
the rivalry debate cup will be the
main feature of this morning’s Stu-
dent association assembly.

The debate, between teams repre-
senting the senior and freshmen
classes, will be: “Resolved: That the
Chicago Plan be instituted at New
York State College for Teachers."

The affirmative team is composed
of Virginia Hall, J. Edmore Melan-
son and Gordon T. Rand, seniors;
the negative squad consists of Doro-
thea Devins, Edwin Holstein and
Eivion Williams, freshmen.

From an interview with the de-
baters, the News has obtained the
following explanation of the Chi-
cago Plan of Instruction.

Freshmen enter the university
with the regular ﬁfteen high school
credits, generally with a scholastic
average in the upper nfty per cent
of their class. For the first two
years, the students are offered a
series of courses on a general sur-
vey level, and then are permitted
to enter the upper five divisions of
the college in order to specialize in
the ﬁeld of their particular interest.

The new features of the plan,
however, include a system of optional
attendance at classes and volun-
tary examination writing. The col-
lege provides a board of examiners
whose duty it is to prepare com-
prehensive examinations, which may
be taken by the student whenever
he and his dean agree he is pre-
pared to take them.

Attendance at classes, the debaters
claim, is optional with the students.
The philosophy behind this proce-
dure is based on the theory that
there are many parts of courses
which students have already mas-
tered, and therefore it is pointless
for them to duplicate these sections.

Today's debate marks the seventh
appearance of the class of '39 before
the Student assembly. In all pre-
vious debates the seniors have been
victorious, The winner of today's
discussion will meet it Learn from
the junior class to decide the 1939
recipient of tho intramural debating
cup.

The junior cluss won this privilege
by gaining the decision over the
sophomores in a debate on federal
control of advertising presented on
October 28 in assembly.

Betty l-Iuyford, ’39, is coaching the
senior team; while Jane Wilson, '40,
is dirccling the freshmen debaters.

progressing rapidly, according to
Catherine O’lh'yun, vice-president of"
the chitin. Music for Soiree will be
supplich by Ishum Jones and his or-
chestra. Reports from Russell Sage
college, where he played last week,
lndicrdc that tile mucstro’s music
was wolf likcti. He is filling on err-
gugomvnt this weekend at the Uni-
vrrslly of West Virginia. Ishum

ing the possibility of innovating a

Twelve Have Made Pledges;
Thermometer to Show
Daily Progress

A check-up on the progress of the
senior housing drive reveals that so

[far twelve seniors have given their

pledge to contribute. They are:
Duke Hersh, who incidentally was
the first to pledge, Mildred King,
J. Edmore Melanson, Helen Pruslk,
Della Dolan, Harriet Papemaier,
Mary Margaret Pappa, Ruth Pekar—
sky, Anne Kalichman, Frieda Kurk-
hill, Betty Hayford, and Cecil Mar-
rno.

A more vivid record of results
will be shown soon when a huge
wooden thermometer, six feet high,
is set up in the Rotunda of Draper
hall to indicate progress.

A bit more information about the

drive will not be amiss here. Pledgers

need not pay until they get a job;
in fact, they will not be reminded
of their pledge unless they do ob-
tain a position, Moreover, those who
pledge can pay any time the wish,
in any manner they wish, over any
period they wish.

A write-up of State’s dorm drive
has appeared in the N.S.F.A. bul-

‘letin which circulates throughout all

colleges in the United States. The
article commended State college as
one of two colleges in the country
actively recognizing the dormitory
problem.

The alumni office has reported
that last year's class has come
through almost one hundred per cent

a heated discussion, and the proposi- f
tion was defeated by a narrow rnar-
gin.

which came due this February. The
number of seniors who pledge each
year usually amounts to seventy-five
per cent of the class. It is interest-
ing to note that each year at least
one person has paid the full amount
before graduation.

Tangible results of such a drive
can be seen more clearly in the fact
that the present girls' dorm was built
with about fifty per cent in pledges
backing it. In addition to pledging
some people have been kind enough
to supply the rooms with furniture.
