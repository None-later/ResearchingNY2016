Sport is dead! Long live tea and
cake.

The unique (Latin: unus, one;
equus, horse) situation into which
men’s sports have lurchcd during
the downpour-s of the current social
season leaves us arguing around in
circles every time We think of
stressing the great part which such
sports should take in the recrea-

tional functions of the school.
Once upon a time there was a
great philcaopbcr named Plato.

From him we have obtained an in-
teresting idea about the complexi-
ties of life. Because, every time

A. five pound box of candy of a
popular brand will be rattled off at
jnve cents a chance, Candy lovers
twho happen to be refraining from
lsweets needn't fear. The candy is
guaranteed to last through Easter,
Ithat is, if you don't start eating it
‘ before Easter. The drawing will take
,‘place at the close of the carnival.

Last year dancing was planned
during the carnival but this or—
angement was very disturbing. This
year, dancing will take place after
the carnival, which will probably
:nd about 11:00 o'clock.

The punches mentioned above will
be given to the winners of the
bingo. turtle races, wind contests,
I)cnny tossing and darts. The bean

Ping Pong Matehcs’Near End:
Final Games Next Week

This week marked the start or
the pool tournament which is spon-
sored by Intramural council. A sim-
ilar tournament was introduced to
State last year, for the ﬁrst time
in recent years. Matches are being
played on the Palace Recreation
Center tables under the policy of
loser pays, winner rides free from
a thirty-five cent fee.

Twenty-one men have entered the
tourney and two have already fin-
ished the ﬁrst round. Players are ad-
vised to consult the bulletin board
for the time schedules of rounds.

The ping pong matches are delv-
Lng into the final rounds. Edelstein
rounccd Snover recently in an up-
:et. of last year's kitchen tennis
one. In the final match, he will
meet either Brauner or Murphy.

Unfortunately, the records of last
week's intramural basketball games
have been misplaced by intramural
riii'iclals and ytur scribe is unable
to'prcduee an accurate account.
