mended to the student association

the annual report of the Point Re—

wasn't working.” As a result, three
resolutions and a skeleton plan will
be proposed this morning.

Proposed Resolutions

The ﬁrst resolution recommends
that “no changes be made in the
point system this year" while the
second provides “that the present
system be scrapped and a new sys-

!tem of allocating points be devised."

The final resolution calls for the

appointment of a new
committee that would work with the
present committee in perfecting a
new system.”

comparatively small returns.” This
difficulty, however, according to
l'iowui‘d Anderson of the freshman
ranks, might be remedied by the
use of more publicity ut the time
‘of ouch election.

1 Silldunis are quick to list the ad—
vuntngi-s of the new election sys-
[01]). “Secret balloting eliminates
dh'iy politics," was the opinion of

both Roy Walters, ‘30, and Robert
‘Agnc, '41.

ment of their college,” states Rita
Sullivan, ‘40, Also, “By this plan,
hill the hasty decisions made in the

points out.

On the whole, Stale seems to ap-
prch decidedly the results of the
measure which it passed almost un-
animously sevoral weeks back. "At
any mic,” says Robert Martin. ’40,
"any change from the old system
would certainly be an advantage.”

Matthews and Krien
Will Have Lead

In response to popular request
“The Mikado” by Gilbert and Sul-
livan will once more be given on
State’s stage by the Operatic society
in conjunction with Music council.
The presentation will take place in
the auditorium of Page hall Thurs-
day and Friday evenings at 8:30
o’clock.

The members of the Operatic so-
ciety, a one-hour course, have worked
the entire school year under the
direction of Dr. T. F. H. Candlyn,
of music, and
John Nordell, '39, to reproduce this
operetta which met with such great
success at its first presentation here
in March, 1935.

The play, Nordell has explained, is
“truly Gilbert-Sullivan" with its gay
light music and complicated but
humorous plot. The scene is laid
in picturesque old Japan in the days
when young men, especially of the
royal court, did not marry beneath
their station.

A few of the leading parts will
be enacted by old favorites. Charles

record as favoring the purchase by
lthc United States government,
through the T.V.A., of the utility

"I‘.V.A. competes."

A motion asking for the Forum‘s
approval of President Roosevelt's
recent peace plea to Germany and
Italy was presented by Leonard
Fricdlandcr, '39. The discussion on
this issue was focused on the
policy of the plan as outlined by
President Roosevelt, rather than on
what results might or might not

cnsuc in the future. After serious
deliberation, the Forum voted in

favor of the motion. Letters of the
Forum’s; endorsement of the peace
plan will be sent to President Roose—
vclt and to the New York state
congressmen. '

The Forum then debuted on the
pro's and con’s of a state retail
sales tax. At the present time the
state legislature is considering the
sales tax as a means of new rev—
enue. Republican opposition to such
a bill is said to bc Very strong.
Although the Forum was divided in
its opinion of the motion, it fin-
