Protein Research

esting lectures which State college the Advancement 0f 5019"“-

students have had an opportunity to
hear was that given last Tuesday cussed proteins,
in the auditorium of Page hall. The
occasion Was the monthly meeting of chemical

compounds, the

the eastern division of the American acids.

Chemical society and the guest
speaker was Dr. Irving Langmuir,
a man recognized as one of the most
remarkable scientist of the present
day.

We were Just a bit curious as to
whether the evening would offer
anything out of the ordinary. and
we weren't disappointed. The au-
dience itself — and there Was a
good-sized crowd —- was interesting,
for the majority there were out-
siders, students, college professors,
laboratory workers, and well known
ﬁgures of science from the capital
district.

Dr. Langmuir’s record is a bril-
liant one. Since 1906 he has been
associated with the physico-chemical
research department of the General
Electric Company in Schenectady
and is now assistant director there.
His work has resulted in several
important inventions such as the
gas-ﬁlled Tungsten lamp and atomic
hydrogen welding.

In recognition of his work. Dr.
Langmuir has received marks of dis-
tinction in degrees from universities.
and in medals and prizes. In 1932
he received the Nobel prize for his
work in surface chemistry -— the
second American chemist to receive

The greater part of Dr. Langmuir’s
talk concerned various characteris-
tics of proteins. Among these was
the property of specificity, the fact
that each protein—and there are
thousands —— has speciﬁc properties
and acts in a way peculiar to itself.

A particularly interesting property
is that of forming monolayers. That
is, proteins in solution have the
ability to spread out in a layer a
single molecule thick. These ﬁlms
are absolutely invisible.

A third point Dr. Langmuir ex-
plained was the fact that the mole-
cules of proteins are extremely huge.
They are thousands and some mil-
lions of times larger than the usual
molecule with which the scientist is
accustomed to deal.

This last fact led Dr. Langmuir-
to say that the study of proteins
may be thought of as new division
of organic chemistry—the ﬁeld of
magna-molecules. For the present,
science is concerned primarily with
satisfying that eternal scientific cur-
iosity of “what.” "where," and “why”
in ﬁnding out more facts about new
ﬁelds. However, just as other scien-
tific research that began with curi-
osity has led to important applica-
tions so we may reasonably expect

 

the Nobel award. Just recently he

Mrs. Poletti Addresses
Group on Government

Last Wednesday. Mrs. Charles
Polettl, wife of the Lieutenant
Governor of New York state, ad-
dressed a group of State college
students in the Lounge of Rich—
ardson hall. Her topic was a dis-
cussion of the workings of our
state and national governments.
She was sponsored by the Lounge
committee and Miss Helen More-
land. dean of students;

Mrs. Poletti talked informally
for about a half hour, and then
entertained questions from the
students present. She spent
some time in reviewing briefly
the meaning of the word. democ—
racy. She then explained the
workings of our state legislature,
and showed a copy of the legisla-
tive index, a booklet published
weekly, showing current legisla—
tion. Some of her talk was cen-
tered around pressure groups. and
their influence in legislatures.

around college in order to set the
selected teacher aside as a leader
of the faculty.

clcty. was founded in State College
in 1927. Its purpose Is to foster
increased interest in the field of
