We, who have been thoroughly drilled in the
State Regents exams tradition, have learned one
lesson well. We expect to be able to prove all we
say. If we said that the square of the hypotenuse
was equal to the sum of the square of the two sides
of a triangle in geometry, we were expected to show
not only the statement but how we proved it. If
we said Macbeth was an interesting character, we
learned that we had to give specific examples to
prove our point. Most of us learned that lesson
well, and it showed up strikingly last week in assem-
bly when the committee reported on the Pedagogue
proposal.

The committee, as appointed by our president,
was instructed to investigate whether or not it would
be feasible to include the Fed on next year’s associa-
tion budget, and how that could be accomplished.
However, when that report was read in last week’s
meeting, of what did it consist?

1. That the student body was in favor of the
proposal. Far be it from us to belittle, but that
served a little superfluous. The preposal is highly
desirable.

2. That the majority of the students would be
willing to pay an extra dollar to support this
increase.

These facts are of significance, to be sure, but
then the complete report was, stated in so many
words, “it can be done. We offer the following
resolution . . .” Here is where our analogy holds
good. We were glad to hear the favorable report
of the committee, but we maintain that they gave
us no indication as to how the feat could be ac-
complished. We demand a real report of facts and
figures before we decide to jeopardize the future
of the other activities and the medical fund of the
budget. The statement was encouraging, but it
was not enough! Can an extra dollar pay for the
Pcdagoguc, and if so, how? The student body
happily realized that there was more to the
question than this cover-all report, and put off
voting until the measure could be adequately ex-
plained and discussed.

Today we have an opportunity to settle the
situation definitely. We demand from the com-
mittee more than their assurance that it can b:-
done. We want to know how, and as tax payers we
feel that the report of the committee should be more
specific and carry through the analogy. We are
more than willing to admit. the Pedagogue, but we
will not write QED. to the proposition, until We
know how it can he proved.

 
 
 

 

    
 
  
 

 

 

 

 

 

Jottings of An Idiot

Commentstater

Best Comment of the Week is by the faculty mem-
ber who said, “Well the budget cut did one thing for
the faculty, at least, it took their minds off the Euro-
pean crisis."

It seems to us that it must have been a good thing
for the student body too, because none of us have been
swallowing goldfish or mice yet.

In the swing field a new band has appeared on the
radio scene lately that for hot music rates near the
top. This band is the one that plays the blues, Woody
Herman. His clarinet rates with Goodman and Shaw,
sounding a lot like Artie. His theme song has that
same haunting wall that Shaw’s Nightmare has and
he features blues in the old time manner. He looks
like the comer in the swing field, so I'd recommend
you lovers of swing to listen in.

Down at Nick’s in Greenwich Village, New York,
Bobby Hackett’s Dixieland crew has been replaced by
Goodman's old arranger, Spuds Murphy, and his crew.
His band is a little ragged yet on its Bluebird record-
ings but it should develop into one of the best.

The ace trumpet man of Goodman’s band. Harry
James, has a crew that should rate with the best white
bands in the country after he smooths out the rough
edges. He needs a good clarinet and when he gets
this he‘ll be there.

The last band which I’ll mention is the other blues
band you’ve all been hearing and that is Jack Tea-
garden’s muslcrew. The man who sounds like he's
singing while flat on his back is rough yet, and his
trombone section ls too predominant, but Jackson is
too good a musician to let this exist long. so we’ll ex-
pect him to be racing Goodman, Basie, Shaw, and
Ellington for King of Swing next year at this time.

Democracy seems to have triumphed in this school
if this week's election means anything. The polls were
packed all day. And everything seemed to go smooth-
ly leaving one to believe that the little raid on the
assembly did do us some good.

u 61 ‘1 vii 1‘

Moving-up Day is next Friday as all of you know.
The upperclassmen know enough to realize how im-
portant it is. but oftimes some little freshman doesn't
realize its Significance until after he has overslept the
morning session. We expect to see you all there.
Good luck, Juniors.

 

Concert-ed Action

For the second time in a month, student initia-
tive has taken a positive and constructive form. The
first incident, that of the budget protest, was transi-
tory, but the second had a strength and character
that marks it with permanency. We refer, of
course, to the symphony orchestra. which made its
debut last week.

it was a superior job, accomplished under try—
ing and discouraging conditions. We were more
concerned with its success than its effort. We are
ashamed that our pat on the back is so untimely,
for we feel that it would have been more appreciated
early in the year.

All we can do is to attempt to make up for that
oversight. The student body made the first move
in the right direction. It was heartening to see a
sophisticated student body, hardened to student
talent of all kinds, rise to its feet spontaneously in
tribute to the orchestra.

That gesture, sincere and gratifying as it was,
was not enough. We can do much more. If there
are forty people in the school who will work on
such a project merely for love of it, and if the re-
sults of this work so genuinely please the whole
student body, it certainly deserves the permanency
and support it has requested.

When the budget comes up before the assembly,
there will be a large appropriation for Music coun<
cil. How could this money be better used than to
subsidize, at least in part, such a worthwhile organ-
ization? We approve of guest artists, but, in all
fairness, we think the money should be used to hack
constructively a real student enterprise. if the
college organization, devoted to supplying the
musical diet for State college, cannot support its
own talent, then we say it has failed miserably and
we cannot justify its continuance. Here is a chal-

 

lenge to student taxpayers. Will you accept it?

Forum Approves
7 Vent—ook Plan

Panel Group. Will Conduct
Discussion with Y.W.C.A.;
Weed to Be Head

At its renewed session on Tues-
day, May 9, the Political Forum ap-
proved the revised constitution as
submitted by Sadie Flax, ’40, who
represented the Constitution Revi-
sion committee. Among the new
provisions in the constitution is that
clause which requires all committee
reports to be submitted to the
Forum for action no later than one
month after the committee has been
formed.

Pass Resolutions
Two resolutions were reported
from committees and passed. Louise
Hessney. '40, read the report of the
Pedagogue committee, and the For-
um passed in favor of making the
Pedagogue a student publication and
adding one dollar to the student tax
to take care of the expense.
After a heated discussion in which
Michael Walko, Mary Margaret
Pappa, seniors. and Fred Weed, ’40.
played major roles. the Forum
passed in favor of the following
resolution as reported to the Forum
by Mary Margaret Pappa, chairman:
“Resolved: That this forum go on
record as favoring the government
ownership and operation of railroads
in the United States.”

Panel Discussion
On Wednesday evening, from 8:00
to 11:00 o'clock in the Lounge of
Richardson hall, the Forum panel
group will conduct a discussion panel
with the Y.W.C.A. industrial group
on the subject of "Housing."
Betty Fallon, ‘39, co-director
of the panel group. is in charge of
the panel.
Robert Cogger, speaker, announced
that the Forum's calendar for its
next and last regular meeting in-
cludes committee reports on the
Immigration Law, Reciprocal Trade
Agreements, and the NLRB.
‘ At its session on May 2, the fol-
lowing officers were elected for the
year 1939-1940: speaker, Fred Weed,
’40; clerk, Paul Grattan. ’41; and
treasurer, Norman De Neef, '40.

 

State

Affairs

C.E.W.

Sometimes the results of our movie
mogul's attempts to mirror college
life are, to say the least—terrific.
Take that current opus—we aren’t
sure of the name, but it has to do
with the antics of the Greek letter
gals ln lnveigling freshmen for the
ranks. It would appear. to the
uninitiated. that sorority rushing is
a sort of combination of socialized
football and kidnapping. Not that
we're ldealists. mind you . . . such
things may. and undoubtedly do, go
on, but not here, and we think that
they're more apt to be the exception,
even in the most practical schools,
rather than a general condition.
Maybe such films gave people the
queer ideas they get about “the
youth of our nation."

New Books: We haven’t seen
too many. For the music mongers.
The Kingdom of Swing, by Benny
Goodman and Irving Kalodln, is
worth looking up. Kalodin's essays
on swing, interspersed throughout
the volume, are among the best on
the subject.

And report has it. that Scribner's
has ceased publication. Just an-
other of these financial catastro-
phes. Some of the best literary
work hi the country has come from
its pages.

Good news for the seniors: Re-
ports from ACP state that college
grads aren’t so bad off. Figures
show that more than 08% have
never been on relief. Incidentally.
exactly 04% of the men and 55%
of the women reported any connec—
tion beLWecn their present work and
their college major, which fact we
glVe you gratis.

Other interesting figures were
those stating that 75% of the men
and 52% of the women get married.

Arnold Bennett wrote a book called
How to Live on Twenty-four Hours
a Day. We repeat: how? May is
uncomfortably close to June, and
there doesn’t seem to be time enough
to do all that must be done.

Friday is the time for the girl
friend to show the boy friend what a
date should be. We're not quite
sure about the band, though reports
are favorable. The bids are attrac-
tive, the decorations decorative. and
we hope the evening fair and warm-
er. And that isn’t all—the gals
don‘t do things half-way. To com-
plete the weekend the sorority
houses will be decked out for house
formals on Saturday night. The
usual migration from house to house
is anticipated. (Be sure the skele-
tons are well hidden, girls).

On our way to Washington Park
the other day via Draper and the
front steps we noticed a class sit-
ting on the steps in front of the
library. Continuing on our way we
found another class in front of Page.
Our taste in professors runs to the
kind who knows a nice day when
he sees it. Who cares about the
ants?

The International Relations club
did a nice piece of work—not only
in advertising the Dug-out dinner,
but in presenting a novel idea with
a purpose behind it. This week, too.

the Cradle Song posters. which are.

out to Win a prize, have been worth
looking at.

In a list of important State col—
lege events, 1938—39, surely toward
the top would be the organization
of the State College Symphony or—
chestra. Pearlman and Hirsch, the
conductors, and the whole orchestra
deserved the spontaneous rising vote
of appreciation they received. It
was certainly an acknowledgment
of talent and effort; but more than
that, could it have been perhaps
a realization that outside of the
narrow ready-made world We think
important there are others initiat-
ing worth-while things without
beneﬁt of the public eye?

Note taken at the Albany Hos—
pital: Janice Friedman’s pulse rose
from 60 to 80 after a visit from
Lenny Friedlander.
