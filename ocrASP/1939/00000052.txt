pirtoriai Division

Marvels oi Nature

'Most popular oiall photographic subjects

among the collegiate amateurs‘oi the na-
tion are scenes oi nature, ior this division in

our special contest had the greatest number'

oi entries. The general excellence oi the
photos submitted made the task oi the
judges oi this division particularly diiiicult.
ii space had been available, this issue

would have contained almost three times _

the number oi scenic pictures, ior that large
number oi almost equal highquality were in
the semi-ﬁnals division in the judging. in
the three photos on this page we present
the iinal selections, photos which we be-
lieve pay high compliments to the ability
oi college photographers to beautiiully
and accurately record the scenic wonders
oi the world about us. Many are the ele-
ments considered in judging pictorial pho-
tographs, but chiei qualities considered are
composition, technical excellence.

Unusual Camera Studies

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  

Most unusual are the results obtained when the photog-
rapher sets out to create his own pictorial subjects without
relying on the set limitations oi an individual or a scene.
With an opportunity to iorm his own compositions, to regu-
late his lighting, to control movement and iorm, the pho-
tographer gains results that are always interesting and usually
technically periect. Second most popular division in the
Collegiate Digest competition, the still liie section winners

on this page reveal again the important place the student

and iaculty amateurs have attained in the ranks oi the non-
proiessional photographers. The chess picture is an excellent
example oi a composition that has been iormed and lighted
in such a manner that a periectly inanimate scene assumes
liie and brilliance. The remarkably sharp picture oi the sleep-
ing cat is one oi the most photographicaily periect photos
entered. The water lily print is an excellent example oi an
outdoor still liie creation. All in all, these three photos ac—
curately reilect the range oi interest that is obtainable in
still liie photography.
