Campus Picture Parade

Many and varied are the subjects for fine photo-

graphs available on the, college campus, yet col-

open to the campus amateur. Although this divi-

on this page reflect the high quality of the work

being done by the few who see in their immediate

.surroundings the great opportunities for effective

photography.
