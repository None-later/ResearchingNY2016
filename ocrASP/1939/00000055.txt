POPULAR JIM MY FOXX—winner of the 1938 American
League batting crown, and voted the most valuable player in
the League last year—greets the new 1939 baseball season with
a conﬁdent smile and a Camel! Camels rate high with Jimmy. “I
V‘ gave a lot ol thought to the subject of cigarettes—made experi-
ments too—before I settled down to C amcls for keeps! Camels
are hatter tasting~and they’re milder." Be curious enough to try
Camels yourself. Smoke six packs—and you'll see why Camels are
the most popular cigarette in the world. Appealing ilavor— pleas-
ing aroma ——call it what you will, but there’s no mistaking the fact
that Camels give the supreme thrill of smoking pleasure at its best.
