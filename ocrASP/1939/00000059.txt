Last week, Press Bureau received
a letter from Bard College, whose
varsity baseball team State meets
next weekend.

The letter listed the games which
Bard is playing this year. Bob Flck-
er, their manager of baseball. in
commenting on the single game
which had been played at the time
the letter was written, remarked:

We have already played Stev-
ens Tech, at Annandale, and
were defeated, to put it mildly,

by a score of 21 to 1.

The comment seemed slightly
ironical, for we happened to read it
just about the time we learned of
State’s defeat—to put it mildly—at
the hands of Pratt, by a discordant
eighteen runs.

Ficker justiﬁed Bard‘s weak show-
ing by describing the situation at
the college. It seems to the stu—
dents there, that there is an at—
tempt on the part of the administra-
tion to cut intercollegiate ath—
letics from the program.

Since the letter from Bard was
recalved, they succumbed to R.P.I.
(who gave us our ﬁrst setback)
by a 19-5 score. The day be-
fore the R.P.I. game, which was
played last Saturday, the Bard team
was soundly vanquished 15-0, by the
Hamilton squad which the Owls face
Wednesday.

Two more games are yet to be
faced by Bard: one tomorrow,
against Drew; the last. next week,
here. We would like to repeat their
manager's “good wishes for a suc-
cessful season" right back at the
Bard nine, but it's a bit too late for
that.

We hope that they lose the game
against State by a large score, nat-
urally. May they have the best luck
in the world against Drew tomorrow.
We are sorry to hear that oppor-
tunities for building up the team
are being cut out by the Bard ad-
ministration. We sincerely hope that
the faculty will reconsider their idea
of cutting out intercollegiate sports,
especially in view of the desire for
such stimulating competition which
seems to he possessed by Bard men.

We suggest that the committees in
charge of publicity for varsity base-
ball and tennis do something about
keeping games, especially home
games. before the eyes of the dwellers
of State by the use of posters similar
to thOSe used for giving notice of
basketball games this year.

We have no illusions about the
News penetrating the shells of most
sports fans at State. Why. there
might even be some who have never
looked at our sports page—forsaken
ones! At any rate, it is necessary
to keep glaring print around for
those people, who, on a Friday after-
noon remark, “What? State is play-
ing baseball this afternoon? Where
and when?" Besides that, it is often
impossible to print the exact time
and place a match or game is sched—
uled, for usually the indecision of the
managers extends to a period beyond
our deadline.

Jim Chapell wants those who have
any idea that they'd like to par-
ticipate in M.A.A.’s alumni day next
year to communicate with him. This
is necessary in order that a contact
list be drawn up for next year.

It is not necessary that you be
certain of being able to attend this
function. The invitation applies to
all seniors. Participation will be free.
Your name is asked, simply in order
that you may be contacted next year,

Chess Teams to Clash
At Colgate Tomorrow

The chess team, still sporting a
.500 intercollegiate average, will
Journey to Hamilton tomorow. to
meet Colgate in its third college
match.

This will be the second meeting
of the two groups, State having
vanquished the Red Raiders here
last fall. G‘s—2'5... A trimming this
spring by Army rounded out State’s
existing .500 record.

Six boards will be played tomor-
row with Art Fox, Steve Shaw,

John Hoose. Bob Patton, Roy Som-:
mers, and Louis Francello carrying,

the banner for State.

Baseball Team to Avenge
Earlier Season Defeat
in Game at Troy

VAN KEUREN TO PITCH

Nine at Hartwick Tomorrow;
Faces Hamilton Here
on Wednesday

The State college diamond squad
will attempt to break into the win
column this Weekend with two games
scheduled. against R.P.I. today and
Hartwick tomorrow. The previously
postponed Hamilton game will be
played at Bleeeker stadium Wed-
nesday.

Van Keuren to Face RJ’J.

Against the Engineers today, the
Owls will be out to avenge the
previous defeat in the opening game
of the season. Despite the mediocre
brand of play displayed thus far.
the squad feels conﬁdent that it can
punch out its initial victory against
the Engineers.

In the ﬁrst game against R.P.I.
two weeks ago, poor ﬁelding and a
weak attack deprived Dar Van Keur-
en of a victory, after he had pitched
a great game. Despite the fact that
Kline. the R.P.I, pitcher, was in
trouble almost every inning because
of the nine free passes he gave out.
the Teachers were unable to push
over a run. This time the fellows
intend to capitalize on every oppor-
tunity.

So far, R.P.I. has won two of its
three starts. In its opener, it was
turned back by Stevens’ Tech, 7-3.
In the next two games the Engi-
neers rebounded with 3-0 win over
our fair institution and followed it
up with a 19—5 shellacking at Bard's
expense. In all three of these con-
tests, Dave Kline was the pitcher
and since R.P.I., has two games
this weekend, Coach Graham faces
the perplexing problem of a pitch-
ing shortage. It will probably be
Kline on the mound again today
since he is their only pitcher who
has rounded into satisfactory shape.

Fairbank Pitches at Hartwick

Against a powerhouse Hartwlck
outﬁt tomorrow. little can be ex-
pected. They have a ball club
which rates with the best and only
recently had a fourteen game win-
ning streak snapped. To date this
season. the boys from Oneonta have
beaten Clarkson 11-7, Hofstra 13-2,
Upsala 7-2. and Drew 11-0. The
only defeat was at the hands of
Drew 4-2. in the ﬁrst part of a twin
bill. In "Baffler" Bill Burke, they
have a ﬁne pitcher with three years
of veteran service behind him.

It is probable that Fairbank
will take the mound in the en—
counter with Hartwick which will
be played on the Oneonta campus.

Hamilton Game Wednesday

Against Hamilton Wednesday. Van
Keuren will probably toe the mound
again. As far as is known, the men
from Clinton hold a victory over
the weak Bard nine 15-0 and have
been beaten by Union 10-7.

In the Hamilton game, State will
be Shorthanded as Hamilton insists
on a strict freshman rule. This
will prevent Casler from starting at
third, Sprowls playing centerﬁeld,
and several other freshmen from
playing who would usually see ac—
tion.

Pratt Swamps State

Last Saturday the boys suffered
an overwhelming defeat at the hands
of Pratt in New York city by the
score of 20-2 in a game which went
only seven innings. It would be un-
fair. hOcher, to say that this game
was a true test of the State nine's
ability. Van Keuren. pitching with
a sore shoulder, was hit solidly for
tour innings. His pitching stay was
ﬁnally culminated by a home run
by Miller, the Pratt hurlcr. Dar
yielded 13 runs. ’1 in a big third
inning. In the fourth inning,
"Toad" Fairbank came in and. aside
from the sixth frame in which Pratt
had ﬁve runners troop across home
plate, "Toad" did a fairly good Job,
considering the little college pitching
experience he has had. The "Teach—
crs” were badly hampered by the
narrow conﬁnes of the little Pratt
bandbox. The powerful Pratt hit-
ters kept a seemingly continuous
splatter of hits bouncing off the
fences in left and ccntcrﬁeld. It is

 

safe to say that three-fourths of
these hits could have been caught if
the outﬁelders had a chance to go
after them.

 

Rivalry Classes Split
Weekend S ports Clashes

The rivalry football game be-
tween the freshmen and sopho-
mores was ﬁnally played last Fri-
day afternoon on the Page grid-
iron.

Twice victory was within reach
of the fresh as the bullet-like
passes from Virgil Scott went into
the hands of receivers over the
goal line, but each time the ball
was dropped and with it dropped
the freshman victory.

The fresh outplayed the sophs
and had them backed Well into
their own territory a large part
of the game. They displayed a
powerful attack with Scott's pass—
ing and Howie Anderson's run-
ning constant threats.

The game will be replayed this
afternoon on the campus in front;
of Page hall, the game starting at
3:30 o'clock

At the M.A.A.-W.A.A. play day
the freshmen and sophomores
split honors. Behind “Bobby Sel-
fert‘s” very effective pitching, the
frosh swept into a 12 to 0 victory.
The sophomore women won 25 to
21. thus balancing the points
which the men of ’41 lost.

 

 

 

 

Council to Sponsor
Track Meet Tuesday

The annual intramural track and
ﬁeld meet will be held on the cam-
pus in front of Page hall at 4:00
o'clock Tuesday.

On the basis of past performances,
the ﬂeet Bill Torrens, '39, and Bob
Gorman. '39. seem like good bets to
lead the pack in the 100 and 220
yard dashes and the broad jump.

It is improbable that any records,
with the possible exception of those
in the ﬁeld events, will be broken.
The present records were made on
a cinder path. which makes for
much faster times than are probable
over the grass ﬁeld to be used Tues-
day.

Purple and Gold Tennie
Squad to Meet Hobart
Today at: Geneva

BARD RIVAL TOMORROW

Game with Siena Last Friday
Results in Lone Victory
for State Team

The beginning of its season marred
by three successive defeats against
a single victory. the tennis team
will forge ahead in its ambitious
eleven game schedule this week with
twa more matches booked. one for
this afternoon. and the other for
tomorrow.

Home Tilt Tomorrow

This afternoon’s tilt will see the
Purple and Gold racqueteers fac-
ing Hobart on the latter‘s courts
at Geneva. The State netmen re-
turn to Albany tomorrow for their
third home match. this time against
Bard college.

Hobart will be new competition for
state. Bard. however, has had a
spot on the Teachers’ schedule for
many years, with State proving it-
self the master in the majority of
contests in recent seasons.

Gold from lack of practice, the
squad opened its season on April
28 with a 7-2 defeat at the hands of
R.P.I. at Troy, The following day
saw the team sink again in defeat
at Middlebury. nine matches to
none. a score that also prevailed on
May 3 in a return match with the
Vermonters at Albany.

Siena New Rival

It was a team vastly improved at
the cost of earlier defeats that met
and trounced Siena college here last
Friday. seven matches to two.

This match was significant in that
it marked the ﬁrst athletic competi-
tion between the two rival vicinity
institutions. The future will un-
doubtedly see this competition ex-
tended to other ﬁelds of athletics.

Of the six singles matches with
S1ena, State men clinched four. Fra-
ment, Schultze. and Vavasour won
in straight sets, while Tomasian's
Victory required three, 1-8, 6-2. 6-4.
In the three doubles matches, Siena
was unable to eke out a single vic-
tory. The pair-ups for State were
Frament and Smith, Doran and
Tomasian, and Bliss and Sense.

New Comers Triumph

Captain Ken Doran. '39, points out
as signiﬁcant the fact that all the
newcomers to the squad, participat-
ing in the Slena contest, won their
matches. Schultze and Vavasour,
freshmen, each pounded out victor-
ies, while a team made up of Karl
Sense, '39, and Irving Bliss, ’42, tal-
lied a doubles win for the State
score.

The six veterans of last year.
Doran, Frament. Rand, Stan Smith.
Tomasian, and Kilb, at present
compose the varsity. Since nine is
the desired number, play-oil's are
being conducted among the
neophytes to determine who will
receive the three vacant posts. Re-
maining aspirants will then be per-
mitted to contest the positions of
bottom varsity men.
