“The Defense Rests ”

Today in the Legislature of the state will be de-
cided the future of this college. not only for next
year, but for all the years to follow. We of the
student body rest. temporarily at least, upon the
action We l'ia\c taken. We can do little but wait
for the dcci<ion that our representatives will make.

 

and we are (llllit‘ content to accept that decision,
feeling that we have stated our case as thoroughly
and as intelligently as befits a group of citizens of
the state.

Let us recapitulate briefly. ()ur stand has been
one prompted by self defense; we have asked noth—
ing that has not previously been ours. We have
sought no increases. satisfied that our school was
offering us more than a fair chance for a superior
education. We have merely attempted to maintain
that high standard which we have achieved through
years of effort.

thir motives have not been entirely selfish. We
have more than an apathetic regard for the future
of the secondary schools in which we will teach. and
for the students who will take oiir places llt‘f‘t‘. We,
t‘tlllVllltt‘tl that cduration is a basil principle of any
tountiy have attempted to wt forth the disastrous
results of stit’li a budget tttt to State tollcgc.
thtr demands have not been exorbitant. .\s
future ( itizcns. we uphold the printiplc of ct‘otiottfy,
and \\‘c ttillllllt‘lltl the efforts of the legislators to
lighten the lozid of thc incrliurdcnt-d tax payer.

Conversation With An Idiot

- Commentstater —-

“When I was in Tibet." said the old Llama. "not
so long hence. the great gainnion told me of a college
where the students had ii voting system that was so
honest and fair and secret that they thought it would
work itself. And so they let. it go. and interest lagged
more and more until only the candidates themselves
voted. Democracy went. out the window and the whole
system went to pieces."

Yup. the gammon was right bitt then I always
think of the Llamasery's college when everybody voted
The papas
spread all over the place and lalas that were dubious
were practically told how to vote by these papas.
Maybe it was democracy but somehow when some—
body is looking over your shoulder. whispering to you
how to vote—it doesn‘t seem right.

Maybe if the College had realized that they Were
voting for their leaders without thinking. they would
have thought. but they didn't, think. so they elected
thoughtless men without thinking. So. their lalas dc-
cidcd that they wanted a fair deal. so they set up a
secret ballot. The voters had to walk about. ten feet
out Of their way whcii they went to see the dancing
girls. However. the falas were too disinterested to
walk this or too lazy. Now the papas had irons in the
fire or were up for gammon or backgammon. and they
trtidged this ten feet and missed watching the whirling
feet of the devilish dervishes—they voted and they
won. The lalas couldn't complain because they were
getting a secret ballot, This was democracy and that's
what they wanted.

Now. frankly, I think that this system and apathy
was highly odoroiis.

I know that I‘m an Old fog bound traditionalist but
I think that you train for democracy. or whatever you
want to call it. every day in all the little affairs deal-
ing with your leaders and friends. Well, I guess that
I've said enough about that. guess I'll see what hap-
pened in the balloting for presidency of padded cell row."

’I‘hc old llama cleared his throat with a mighty
"hum" and continued, "The Llamasery which I at—
tended had a number of teachers but they at-
ways set in their little cupoias and muttered words of
oracular wisdom but did naught clsc. Oh. how I wish-
ed they could llffl)('ll(l and be one of us especially
when we Wt‘f‘t‘ in our last year. I alt'ays felt that if
we‘d had good discussion groups and they forgot our
marks \Vt' would have had better classes and learned
more in oitr and their special field. But the time I
suggested it they _lt‘t'l'(‘(l at me and finally they sent
llll' here."

With a disgruntled laugh. the old Llama was led
away by his kccpcr,
