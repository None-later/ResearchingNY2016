' State Tennis Squad Meets

RPl Netmen at Troy Today

Ambitious Schedule Receives
Approval of Faculty
Athletic Group

RIDGEFIELD COURT OUT

Varsity Squad ls Indeﬁnite
Pending Team Tryouts
for Candidates

The State tennis squad, as yet
unknown, will launch its ﬁrst ef-
forts of the 1939 season in a match
this afternoon against R.P.I. on the
Troy courts of that institution.

Published as tentative last week,
the new schedule has since received
the approval of both Dean Nelson
and the Faculty Athletic committee,
with but. one exception. The match
booked for May 19 against Connecti-
cut State Teachers at New Britain,
Connecticut, has been cancelled be—
cause of the Moving-up day cere-
monies scheduled for that date. It
is not yet known what action the
squad management will take in re-
placing the scratched tilt.

Meet Middlebury

This afternoon’s match will be
followed up quickly tomorrow with
an encounter at Middlebury. Man-
ager Ken Doran states that these
ﬁrst two matches will serve more
as warm-ups to augment the sparse
indoor practice to which the team
has thus far been limited. Regular
outdoor practice sessions have been
prevented by inclement weather and
the resultant late opening of the
Albany courts. Middlebury will be
remet here, Wednesday, May 3.

The squad will be unable to secure
the superior Ridgcfleld courts on
Partridge street for home contests
as was hoped. Consequently it will
be necessary to negotiate for the use
of whatever city courts may be avail-
able.

Lack Official Approval

The necessity of obtaining the of-
cial O.K. of both Dean Nelson and
Dr. Dorwaldt of the candidate list
has made tryouts for the varsity
squad impossible before the ﬁrst
matches. As a result. the team to
face R.P.I. this afternoon will be
an arbitrary grouping. It is re-
ported that the services of Will Fra-
ment. No. 1 man last year, will be
lost to the squad for Saturday's
game at Middlebury.

The tentative list of candidates
follows: Ken Doran, Karl Sense, and
Gordon Rand, seniors; Willard Fra-
mcnt. Max Sykes, and Edward

Tomaslan, juniors; Cyril Kilb and‘

Stan Smith, sophomores, and Irv-
ing Bliss. Henry Brauner, Edward

Colmar. Kenneth Johnson. Lothar,

Schultzc. Virgil Scott. Al Stiller, and
John Vuvasour, freshmen.

Six of these. Doran, Rand, Fra-
lncnl, Tomosian. Smith, and Kilb.
arc vctcrons from last season's cam-
paign. For home contests, the State
team will consist of nine men while
six will travel for away games.

“Mainstay of Colgate U’s first

“Dean of Albany officials"

“Riz”

We placed the three letter word
standing for a good fellow at the
apex of our little trio of terms as a
climax to a few of the titles through
which Riz has waded in the past
many years, because it's more as
that title that he is known to us
than the high-falutin' things pre-
ceding it.

Riz leaves State this year. It is
meet that MAA’s banquet should
honor a man whose interest in sports
has been as evidently deep seated as
his has been. If we felt pedagogical.
we might point out a few morals
on the value of sports to a man's
man. But We don't and we won't.

On second thot. perhaps a few
lessons could be learned~—by State's
faculty—from one of the best liked
faculty members. We admire him
for his interest in sports, selfish little
brutes that We are.

Captain Quattrocchi looks for the
best in State’s baseball future, even
through dark glasses. He was given
the dark glasses in a recent battle
with “the doc” when he was told
that the injured knee which he has
nourished through several sports this
year would keep him out of the line-
up of the purple and gold ball squad.

Quattrocchl's loss will be felt keen-
ly by the team. He was a mainstay
of last year's squad. especially on the
long end of a bat. Quattrocchi‘s loss
will also be felt keenly by Quat-
trocchl. who likes baseball.

Tuesday, he offered his resignation
of the captain‘s berth, feeling that
he would not be of much use to the
team on the bench. Tuesday. his
resignation was refused by team
members. He was Just plain told
that the captaincy was his for keeps.
This makes Frank the ﬁrst non-
playing captain of a State nine. A
one-day captain will be chosen be-
fore each game.

The captain feels that this year's
squad will be no pushovers. with the
single Weak link lying in the re-
cclving end of the batteries. The gap
behind the plate may be filled by
Brophy, shown in practice to have

 

the form of a good receiver.

The MAA-FAG squabble is dcfin-
litcly being drawn out in the right
ldircctlon. The conference bctwccn
lthe tWo committees last week left
iMAA pretty ncltrly on its own, with
a half promise that the PAC will

M.A.A. Will Honor ‘Riz’
Al Testimonial Dinner

This year, M.A.A.’s annual
awards banquet will take the
form of a testimonial dinner to
Dr. Adna Risley, professor of his-
tory, more commonly and affec-
tionately known as “Riz” to his
associates, friends, and under-
classmen in bull sessions, The
banquet will be conducted Thurs-
day, in the college cafeteria with
a toll fee of ﬁfty cents.

Highlights of the banquet will
be an address by Dr. A. R. Bru-
bacher, president of the college.

business will also prevail — the
giving of awards to those eligible
candidates in varsity and intra-
mural sports.

The banquet will be the scene
of the ﬁrst award of the intra-
mural cups for basketball and

cials.

early choice to gain the champion-
ship. Howaver. College house and

By trainload and busload State
maidens are migrating to the great
out-of-doors in answer to spring's
clarion call—which, with the aid of
an eartrumpct or two, we are ﬁnally
able to hear. This week's expedition
to Camp Johnston will be the
first of the spring series. Chair-
man Fran Rlanl predicts a highly
successful weekend. particularly in
view of the large number of campers
who have signed up. The weekend
planned for May 5-7 promises to be
just as well attended. Chairman
June Palmer will select her com-
mittees from those who plan to at-
tend.

Shades of Bingo, Screeno and
Lucky! Captains North and Chap-
man have devised a novel plan to
stimulate interest in swimming and
attendance at the pool at each
of the swimming practices (which
incidentally will meet on Tuesday
and Friday afternoons, and Thurs-
day nights at Bath 3). Each swim-
mer will draw a number represent-
ing the distance she is to swim,
officially. during that practice. The
swimming distances will be re-
corded and computed for the whole
season, when a prize will be
awarded to the holder of the dis-
tance record. Cute, huh?

Captain Parizot announces that
riding is do rigour again. But the
parade grounds have been moved
from Anspach's to an academy. way
out on Washington avenue. Riding
times will be either Friday after-
noons or Saturday mornings. or
both. Watch bulletin board for def-
inite times. In case you‘ve forgot-
ten. ridlng rates are $1.00 an hour,
and a $3.00 refund is offered to
every person completing ten hours of
riding.

Varsity to Meet RPl Nine
At Bleeker Field Tonerrow

Contest to Display New Men
in State Nine Lineup
Against Trojans

QUALITY UNCERTAIN

Hustle and Spirit of Squad
Mark Training Period
on Practice Field

After one week of hard work.
the State college varsity baseball
squad opens against RPI of Troy
at Bleecker Stadium. tomorrow aft-
ernoon. In fact, this week of in-
tensive work marks the ﬁrst success-
ful training period the athletes haVe
enjoyed this season.

Coach G. Elliot Hatﬁeld has plenty
of men to work with and should pre-
sent a rather formidable outﬁt
against the engineers. Handicapped
by the loss of last season’s regular
catcher and by the loss of Captain
Frank Quattrocchi who injured his
knee prior to the Easter recess, Hat-
ﬁeld has had to make some shifts.
Only four positions are being ﬁlled
by those who held them last year.
These are the center and rightﬁeld
posts. the shortstop and pitching
spots. Here the fans will see the
familiar faces of Barrett, Hurd.
Danilewicz. and Van Keuran.

Positions Doubtful

The rest of the set-up is almost
a complete change, with the excep-
tion of second base. This post is
to be ﬁlled by Toad Fairbank. who
saw service in almost every place
except catch last season. In fact.
Toad played quite a number of
games at second last year so that the
position is not really new to him.

At ﬁrst base Hatﬁeld has placed
Vince Gillen, a sophomore. Gillen
is a hustler from the word go, and
handles himself well around the in-
itial sack. His hitting, as is that
of the other players. is questionable
until put under test. Vince is plenty
big and should be able to ride the
ball well.

At third base is Ed Casler, This
curly-headed fellow has been smooth
in practice. He has yet to show
what he can do under ﬁre, but if
his work thus far is any criterion
of his ability he should go along
pretty well.

Left ﬁeld shows a surprise change.
John Shearer. last season's third
base man, now finds himself pastur-
ing on the greensward of the outer
garden. The post is new to him and
time alone will tell whether or not
he belongs there.

Four Eyed Catcher

The last position, the catchcr's will
present a surprise to all the fans.
Coach Hatﬁeld is going to unveil one
of those rarities in baseball, 8. be-
spectacled receiver. Bill Brophy,
sophomore. is to be the State var-
sity novelty. However, it will be-
hoovc the fans to skip all their
fretting over Bill’s ability for the
lad shows excellent qualities behind
the plate. The only question left is
whether or not he can handle a
pitcher capably. No one knows.
Here again only contests will re-
vcul his ability along this line.

As far as actual games go. the

varsity is an unknown quantity. In
practice, however the boys look good.
One of tllc very pleasant things to
notice this year is the hitstle and
spirit of the inch. No position is
secure and the competition is keep-
ing them on edge. If this spirit
prcvoils throughout the season, the
l'cllows should come through.
3 RPI will be no more Well prepared
