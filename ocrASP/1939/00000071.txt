We, wllo have been thoroughly drilled in the
State Regents exams tradition, have learned one
lesson well. We expect to be able to prove all we
sav. li WL‘ said that the square of the hypotenuse
was equal to the sum of the square of the two sides
of a triangle in geometry, we were expected to show
not only the statement but how we proved it. if
we said Macbeth was an interesting character, we
learned that We had to give specific examples to
prove our point. Most of us learned that lesson
well, and it showed up strikingly last week in asscm»
bly when the committee reported on the I’l'rltlgagllr

proposal.

The committee, as appointed by our president.
was instructed to investigate whether or not it would
be feasible to include the I’rd on next year's associa-
tion budget, and how that could be accomplished.
However, when that report was read in last week's
meeting, of what did it consist?

I. That the student body was in favor of the
proposal. "ar be it from us to belittle, but that
served a little superfluous. The proposal is highly
desirable.

It seems to us that it must have been a good thing

In the swing field a new band has appeared on the
radio scene lately that for hot music rates near the
top. This band is the one that plays the blues. Woody
Herman. His clarinet rates with Goodman and Shaw.
sounding a lot like Artie. His theme song has that
same haunting wail that Shaw’s Niall/mare has and
he features blues in the old time manner. He looks
like the comer in the swing field. so I'd recommend
you lovers of swing to listen in.

Down at. Nick's in Greenwich Village. New York,
Bobby Hackctt‘s Dixieland crew has been replaced by

‘ Goodman‘s old arranger. Spuds Murphy. and his crew,

lugs but it should develop into one of the best.

The ace trumpet man of Goodman's band. Harry
James. has a crew that should rate with the best white
bands in the country after he smooths out the rough
edges. He needs a good clarinet and when he gets
this he'll be there.

The last band which ['11 mention is the other blues
band you've all been hearing and that is Jack Tea-
gardcn's musicrcw. The man who sounds like he's
singing while flat on his back is rough yet. and his
trombone section is too predominant. but Jackson is
too good a musician to let this exist long. so We'll ex-
pect him to be racing Goodman. Basic, Shaw. and
Ellington for King of Swing next year at this time.

I)rnlm*rm‘l/ seems to have triumphed in this school
if this week's t‘lt‘('l.l()ll means anything. The polls were
packed all day. And everything seemed to go smooth-
ly leaving (me to helich that the little raid on the
assembly did do Us some good.

The upperclassmcn know enough to routine how im-
portant lt ls, but oftlmcs some little freshman doesn't.
realize its significance until after he has overslcpt the
morning session. We expect to see, you all there.
Good luck, Juniors.

Concert-ed Action

lior the second time in a month, student initia- .

livc has taken a positive and constructive form. The
first. incident, that of the budget protest. was transi-
tory, but the second had a strength and character
that marks it with permanency. We refer. of

course, to tile symphony orchestra. which made its ,

debut last week.

it was a superior job, accomplished tludcr try-
ing and discouraging conditions. We were more
concerned with its success than its effort. We are
ashamed that out put on the back is so untimely,
for we feel that it would have been lllol'c :lpprel iated
early in the year.

All we can do is to attempt to make up tor that
oversight. The student body made the first mch
in the right direction. it was heartening to \(‘t' a
\tlllllihllt’ililffl student body, hardened to student
talent oi all kinds, rise to its feet spontaumuslv ill
tribute to the orlhcstl'a. I
