Bcsl Commont of the chIr is by the faculty mem—
her who said. “Well the budget cut did one thing for
the faculty. at least. it took their minds off the Euro-

In the swing field a new band has appeared on the
radio scene lately that for hot music rates near the
top. This band is the one that plays the blues. Woody
Herman. His clarinet rates with Goodman and Shaw,
