l’Ol’Ul.AR JIMMY FOXX—winncr of the 1938 American
League butting crown, and voted the most valuable player in
the League last year—greets the new 1939 baseball season with
a conﬁdent smile and a Cnmell Camels rate high with Jimmy. “I
gave rt lot of thought to the subject of cigarettes—made experi-
ments too—~lwlbrc I settled down to Camels for keeps! Camels
are better tasting—and they’re milder." Be curious enough to try
Camels yourself. Smoke six packs— and you’ll see why Camels are
the most popular cigarette in the world. Appealing ﬂavor—~pleas-
ing aroma ——call it what you will, but there's no mistaking the fact
that (.‘srmcis give the supreme thrill of smoking pleasure at its best.
