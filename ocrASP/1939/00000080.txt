Last Week. l’ress Bureau received
a letter from Bard College. whose
varsity baseball team State meets
next weekend.

The letter listed the games which

er. their manager of baseball. in

commenting on the single game

which had been played at the time
the letter was written. remarked:
We have already played Stev—
ens Tech. at Annaiidale. and
were defeated. to ptit it mildly.

by a score of ‘21 to l.

The comment seemed slightly
ironical. for we happened to read it
just about the time We learned of
State's defeat—to put it mildly—at
the hands of Pratt. by a discordant
eighteen runs.

li‘icker justified Bard's weak show-
ing by describing the situation at
the college. it, seems to the stit-
dents there. that there is an at-
tempt on the part of the administra—
tion to ciit intercollegiate ath-
letics from the program.

Since the letter from Bard was
received. they succumbed to R.P.I.
[who gave us otir first. setbacki
by a Iii—:3 score. The day be-
fore the it.P.I. game, winch was
played last Saturday. the Bard team
was soundly \anquished 15-0. by the
Hamilton squad which the Owls face
Wednesday.
