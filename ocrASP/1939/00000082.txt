Smith Announces
Dates for Tests

Dr. D. V. Smith, professor of so-
cial studies, announces that the
qualifying comprehensive exam in
social studies will be given on May
23. 24, and 25 in rooms 20 and
28 of Richardson hall. All sopho-
more students who are expecting to
major or minor 1' this department
are requested to . :‘lt on all
days.

The examination hi“ i ‘ an on
Tuesday and Thursday, IV. 23 and
25, respectively, from .3230 to
5:00 o'clock. On Wednesday the
exam will start at 7:30 o’clock in
the evening. In case any student
has conﬂicting classes on Tuesday
or Thursday, they are requested to
get in touch with Dr. Smith im-
mediately. so that arrangements can
be made.

It is necessary that the exam be
given at this time so that junior
schedules may be made out. As
soon as the examination is ﬁnished.
preceptors will be announced.

This examination is being given
for the first time, instituting the
new system of the social studies
department. Only sophomore can-
didates are to be permitted entrance
to the exam.

The new program devised under
the direction of Dr. Smith is de-
signed to meet the individual needs
of students. Since the comprehen-
sive test will cover every phase of
the social studies ﬁeld, it will re-
veal what phases the student knows
the least about. and the preceptor
will advise him to take courses along
these lines in the future. .

Senior Class Supports Drive
for Student Union Building

With over $6,000 pledged to the
Dorm fund, the class of 1939 is wind-
ing up its annual drive to secure
pledges for the erection of a Student
Union building.

J . Edmore Melanson. ’39, chairman
has announced that May 16 is to
be the closing date for the drive.
The drive was inaugurated by Dr.
John M. Sayles, principal of Milne
High, at an assembly program in
February.

This is the fifth year that the
senior classes have been pledging
money to a building to be used as a
combined men's dorm and recreation
center. In his speech to the as-
sembly, Dr. Sayles announced that
if this year's fund was sizeable,
plans would be drawn for the build-
ing, and steps would be taken to.
commence Work on the construction. 1

The new dorm will be built on‘

Alumni Residence halls, and willI

form another unit in a proposed “all.
State” quadrangle.

A new campaign idea was insti-
tuted this year to secure support
from seniors for this fund. Rather
than pledging $100, which has been
the customary amount in past years,
the seniors have been asked to make
the participation record of the class
of 1939 100 per cent. Pledges run
from $5 to $200. Although the first
installment of the pledge is not due
until February, 1940, some pledgers
have already completed payment in
full or in part.

Why this splash of color? The
