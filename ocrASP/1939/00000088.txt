(7. I". I“.

Not so long ago. we remember. we
sat in a big chair some place with a
pipe or somethin' and a log fire to
face us.

SiiiCe that time. we have had no
time to relax and sink itito the ease
of a comfort which provokes such
peaceful thought.

But tonight. We resolved to slow
down and think. no matter what the
effort.

Thoughts come quickly!

Why. for instance, could not the
sports program be worked out to
agree with the social calendar of
the school? We fail to see how.
with a little pee-thinking, basket-
ball games could be left for junior-
prorn nights with fellows like Fra-
ment or Simmons on the basketball
team.

It might be necessary to hold
games dttrltig the Week. or leave
other functions to week-nights it"
this were necessary. it should be
done. not evaded.

How about a really integrated iii-t
trainural program‘.’ A plan likcl

 

t
i

this . . . Have a program corri-
posed of six events—sol'tball. touch-
tacklc. tennis. basketball. bowling.

and ping—pong. y

Organise it along fraternity and
group house lines (live points for
the placing oi men on varsity teams
(to allow for those players whose ill-
eligiliility through \til’Sil)‘ pai'tleipa.
tioii weakens thctr group's strength.i

A fttll program would necessarily
entail sortie tltottgltt. it would be
a good thing to look over ltl’l's tn~
tratnui'al Lt'ldlli which. according to
college oil'tcials. is one of the neatest
iii the country. it would be well
to campaiin ior claiiiiitig the gym
and commons on Saturday after—
noons for iilliiig oitt such a program,

Let's secure the artnory for im»
portant basketball games. The in«
tercst of Albany in intercollegiate
competition in this sport can be best
proven by the support it gave to tltc
game staged a season ago when
Nolre Dame riiet (‘olgate.

With a proper build—up. a State-
ltPi game would be a big drawing
attraction. More roorti would also
l)t' provided for students oi the two
St‘lltltllh.

Difficulty is being found forever
in the running oil" of intcrclass ri-
valry sports. Why not one or two
days when classes would be set aside

during the school year and these
events could be held‘.’ Such (lays
could also be used to advantage for
the inclusion of corribiiicd .il.\/\-

Squad Loses Matches to Bard
and Hobart, 5-4, 8-],
Over Weekend

With tomorrow's scheduled match
against Connecticut State Teachers
postponed because of conflict with
Moving—up day. the tennis team willl
remain inactive until Saturday when.
the netmen are booked to clash with
Brooklyn Poly on the Albany courts.

What was originally planned to be
the second meeting with Connecticut!
State will be played Wednesday.
as their intitial match. Captaint
Ken Doran has written the Nutmeg- 
gers' management suggesting thaty
the postponed match be held there]
on Memorial Day. As yet. however.
no deiitilte action has been taken.

New Files

Neither Brooklyn Poly nor Coiitiec-.
ticttt State were on the 'l‘cachers'
schedule oi last season. Connecticut.
thus far this year. has split its tirst
two meets. dropping a match to the;
Coast Guard Academy. 5-4. while‘
later downing iirldgewater ’I‘cachers'
College of Massachusetts. 7-2. It is
interesting to note that Connecticut
has for the past, two years Won the
New England 'I‘eacliers' College Con-
i'crencc.

The State squad opened its last.
weekend campaign with a solid tl—l

Rivalry to Reach Peak
With Pushball Contest

Organized rivalry will again
hold the spotlight this afterhoon
starting at 6:30 o’clock when the
freshman and sophomore push-
bail teams clash on the campus
in front of Page hall. This will be
the second meeting of the two
teams and promises to be a bat-
tle. The class of '41 won the ﬁrst
encounter last fall by a score of
8-3. Since then. the fresh have
gained more experience and vow
that they will avenge the defeat.
Approximately thirty freshmen
and twenty sophomores have.
signed up to play. Since reserve
strength counts heavily in the en-
counter. the fresh seem to have
an edge. However. unorganized
ri ialry during the past week has
aroused both classes to a tight-
ltig pitch. 'I‘herel’ore. all advan-
tages must be forgotten as the
two teams battle for victory.

This will be the second rivalry
contest this week. The rivalry
tiig-of—war was conducted yester—
day al'ter'noon. it was the first
titiie that a tiig-of—wai' has been
included as a part of rivalry and
it will become a traditional part
of the class rivalry activities.

a while it seemed that State would
come out on top. Going into the
last of the seventh. the score stood
3 to 2 iii State's favor. However.
l‘li’i retaliated in the lucky half to
tally once on two hits with a stolen
base sandwiched in between. The
Owls piit a man 011 in the elglith
but tell him stranded. Troy‘s engi-
neers loaded the bases in their half.
rind Dar Van Keut'en proceeded to
hit. the next batter to force in the
winning run.

State did all its scoring in two in-
ititigs. the second and seventh. In
the second. Fairbank led off with a
single. tlicn stole sicond and third
respectively. Kline. RPI’s hurlei‘.
tanned Van Kern-en and Barrett, but
Spt'owls cracked a single to put
Stale ahead 1 to t),

The seventh saw State piit over
two runs. Fairbank again led off
with a hit. stoic second arid scored
on Van Keurcn's single. Van
