MEET CONN.WEDNESDAY

 

 

 

C. F. F.
Not so long ago. we remember, we
sat in a big chair some place with a
pipe or somethin' and a log ﬁre to
face us.

Since that time, we have had no
time to relax and sink into the ease
of a comfort which provokes such
peaceful thought.

But tonight. We resolved to slow
down and think. no matter what the
effort.

Thoughts come quickly!

Why, for instance, could not the
sports program be worked out to
agree with the social calendar of
the school? We fail to see how,
with a little pro-thinking, basket-
ball games could be left for junior-
prom nights with felloWs like Fra-
ment or Simmons on the basketball
team.

It might be necessary to hold
games during the week, or leave
other functions to week-nights If
this were necessary. it should be
done, not evaded.

How about a really integrated in-
tramural program? A plan like
this . Have a program com-
posed of six events—softball, touch-
tackle. tennis, basketball, bowling.
and ping-pong.

Organize it along fraternity and
group house lines. Give points for
the placing of men on varsity teams
(to allow for those players whose in-
eligibility through varsity participa.
tion weakens their group's strength.)

A full program would necessarily
entail some thought. It would be
a good thing to look over RPI’s in-
tramural set—up which. according to
college officials. is one of the neatest
in the country. It would be well
to campaign for claiming the gym
and commons on Saturday after-
noons for ﬁlling out such a program.

Let’s secure the armory for im-
portant basketball games. The in-
tercst of Albany in intercollegiate
competition in this sport can be best
proven by the support it gave to the
game staged a season ago when
Notre Dame met Colgate.

With a proper build—up, a State-

Squad Loses Matches to Bard
and Hobart, 5-4, 8-1,
We'd/321$“

With tomorrow’s scheduled match
against Connecticut State Teachers
postponed because of conﬂict with
Moving-up day, the tennis team will
remain inactive until Saturday when
the netmen are booked to clash with
Brooklyn Poly on the Albany courts.

What was originally planned to be
the second meeting with Connecticut
State will be played Wednesday,
as their intltfal match. Captain
Ken Doran has written the Nutmeg-
gers' management suggesting that
the postponed match be held there
on Memorial Day. As yet. howover.
no deﬁnite action has been taken.

New Foes

Neither Brooklyn Poly nor Connec-
ticut State were on the Teachers’
schedule of last season. Connecticut.
thus far this year, has split its first
two meets, dropping a match to the
Coast Guard Academy, 54. while
later downing Bridgewater Teachers'
College of Massachusetts, 7-2. It is
interesting to note that Connecticut
has for the past two years won the
New England ’I‘eachers' College Con-
ference.

The State squad opened its last
weekend campaign with a solid 8-1
Lrouncing at the hands of Hobart
college at Geneva. Frament and
Stan Smith were the only State win—
llCl‘S, fighting out a hard doubles
victory over Silvers and Blane. 6-4.
6-8. 8—6. In the singles, Frament
and Schultzc. number one and six
men respectively, offered the stiff-
est competition against the obvi-
ously superior Hobart racqueteers.

Lose to Bard

'I'ircd by the long 400 mile Journey
and stiff competition of the day be-
fore, the team returned to Albany
Saturday to drop a heartbreaking
5—4 contest to Bard. one of the few
victories which Bard has ever been
able to gain over State in their
many years of not rivalry.

In the singles matches. the teams
split. each taking three. F"ament
and Smith each trounced their op-
ponents in straight sets. whilc

Rivalry to Reach Peak

Organized rivalry will again
hold the spotlight this afterhoon
starting at 6:30 o’clock when the
freshman and sophomore push-
ball teams clash on the campus
in front of Page hall. This will be
the second meeting of the two
teams and promises to be a bat-
tle. The class of ’41 won the ﬁrst
encounter last fall by a score of
8-3. Since then, the trash have
gained more experience and vow
that they will avenge the defeat.
Approximately thirty freshmen
and twenty sophomores have
signed up to play. since reserve
strength counts heavily in the en-
counter, the fresh seem to have
an edge. However, unorganized
rivalry during the past week has
aroused both classes to a ﬁght-
ing pitch. Therefore, all advan-
tages must be forgotten as the
two teams battle for victory.

This will be the second rivalry
contest this week. The rivalry
tug—of—war was conducted yester-
day afternoon. It was the first
time that a tug-of—war has been
included as a part of rivalry and
it will become a traditional part
of the class rivalry activities.

 

 

 

Rivalry

Summary

After an exhaustive summary of
the rivalry events. the sophomores
have a slight edge over the freshmen.

During the Dust Week the fresh-
men and sophomores have played
two games of football and each time
they have tied for honors. At Mc-
Gown's grove last week. the fresh-
men squad garnered 3 points from
the sophomores in the softball con-
test. At the same time the sopho—
more womcn’s squad drew back the
three points by defeating the fresh-
men women.

Lost week the sophomores dug out
of a waste paper basket the mascot

 

which was hidden by Myskanla. The
five points will be awarded to thcj
sophs on Moving-up (lay when they.

lpl'f'hf‘llt the mascot to the president
lot the Student association.

, During the past few weeks thcl
sophomores have shown a substan-l
tlal lead over the verdant freshmen
lln the rivalry contests. The score
.whcn last known. was 12“;- to 4‘: in‘

A. A.'s high spot of the week is its
annual Moving-up day weekend out-
ing to Camp Johnston. Instead of
departing to the hinterlands to-
morrow, as is the usual custom for
weekends. the jaunt is scheduled for
Saturday. Activities for the week-
end include the regular hiking,
swimming and sunning. Most of
the campers will spend only one day
at the Chatham cabin. but sea-
soned outdoor fiends will prefer to
remain until Sunday afternoon.
Heading the program of events for
the weekend are Fran Wood, Mar-
ion Keables and Madeline Beers.

bulletin board until 4:30 o‘clock to-
day. Gct your bid in before it's too

Contrary to last year's procedure,
the year's awards will not be made
over Moving-up day weekend. In-
stead there is to be “Spring Award
Festival" on Friday, May 2'7. At
this festival the year's awards will
be announced and presented. and
the officers for the coming year will
be installed. The festival is being
planned and conducted by Jinny
Mitchell and Lucy King, and chair-
man and assistant chairman, re-

HARTWICK VICTOR 11-2

Powerful Indiana Nine Shells
State Hurlors in Easy ‘
Win at Oneonto

The varsity baseball squad will
launch a swing into the ﬁnal stretch
of its current season Saturday with
a game at Bleecker stadium against
Bard. Hamilton is booked for Tues-
day at Hamilton. '

Downed by RP!

Last Friday afternoon at RPI the
Purple and Gold outﬁt suffered its
third set-back by a 4-3 score. For
a while it seemed that State would
come out on top. Going into the
last of the seventh. the score stood
3 to 2 in State’s favor. However,
RPI retaliated in the lucky half to
tally once on two hits with a stolen
base sandwiched in between. The
Owls put a man on in the eighth
but left him stranded. Troy’s engi-
neers loaded the bases in their half,
and Dar Van Keuren proceeded to
hit the next batter to force in the
winning run.

State did all its scoring in two in-
nings, the second and seventh. In
the second. Fairbank led off with a
single, then stole second and third
respectively. Kline. RPI’s hurler.
fanned Van Keuren and Barrett, but
Sprowls cracked a single to put
State ahead 1 to 0.

The seventh saw State put over
two runs. Fairbank again led off
with a hit, stole second and scored
on Van Keuren's single. Van
Keuren scored on Barrett's ﬂelder's
choice.

llartwick Hitting Powerful

At Hartwick, the following day, the
statesmen encountered excellent
pitching and murderous hitting. A
powerful Hartwick aggregation ran
roughshod over the visitors by an
11 to 2 count.

Coach Hatfield started the game
with Ive Williams, young frosh
rookie. Ive went Well until the third
when the Indians' lead-off man
crushed a home run.

A victory is anticipated by the

Bord college, Saturday, at Bleecker
field. The lads from down the Hud-
son how bad no success this sea-
son. taking evon worse defeats than
those which havo been administered
to State. However. with two teams
of nearly cvcn strength on the field
the game should turn out to be in—

the team when it meets Hamilton on
