STATE COLLEGE NEWS, MAY 18, 1939

 

 Red With Rage, Revenge
Diapered Walrath by Duckings

 

“Helpl They got me, ma!"

Will YOU be next??? Even Tab-
ner wasn’t safe! Even the Janitor
is quaking in his shoes. The classes
of ’41 and ’42 have at last let loose
and given vent to their true feelings
of love and devotion to each other.
And not to be outdone, our stately
Juniors and seniors have staged a re-
vival of rivalry in the good old days.

The frosh made their initial ven-
ture with a beautiful coup d’etat
in Friday's assembly. A blare of
bugles, a swish of curtains, a gentle
thud—and Walrath made his debut
on State’s stage—in diapers! The
war was on. Here was the chance
for action that all the red blooded
'ti’ers had been craving for. Forces
were organized. and Joe Larko was

splashing in the park pool at 2:00 3mg

o'clock. Perlman was‘ relieved of his
pants, and Williams was found in a
rather brief costume Just outside the

But the warfare wasn't limited to
the . men. The weaker ('1) sex of
the class‘of..'42 showed Dower the
Draper hall showers, and within an
hour the sophsretaliated by damp-
ening the respective spirits of Ryer-
son and Devins. Friday night saw
a little confusion at Newman-hall
and several sleepy sophomores were
placed in a position to prove that
water is still wet. ‘

'Jordan‘ had'hls hair cut, and with
that closed round one of the battle
of the classes.

,Monday, afternoon, the sopho-
mores. taking pity on their younger
friends who had been deprived of the
Joys of mascot hunting, decided to

hunt. Little Joe’s disappearance
caused a miniature riot. The fresh,
madly yelling for revenge, stormed
the Activities office and carried off
the surprised Kusak, who, inciden-
tally, returned an hour later garbed
attractively in a pair of flowing
pajamas borrowed through neces-
sity from the Psi Game. Grattan,
too. We hear, was taken for an inter-
esting Journey along Central avenue.
Once more the class of 1941 rallied
and showed Bill Dorrance Just how
a Soph ties knots. Then came the
fresh with a supreme effort. Gar-
dephe was taken for a ride and
forced to part company with a neat
pair of brown trousers at State
and Pearl. Stopped by an officer
of the law Just when he was be-
to feel a slight draft, he
pleaded not guilty and was allowed
to continue his Journey up State
street toward his Alma Mater.

The sophomores' final fling fea-
tured a harboring act—and lol Hube
Moore is now the proud possessor
of a misplaced hair part.

Tuesday night brought more con-
fusion at Newman hall and a little
McCreary trouble in the men's locker
room. And still rivalry goes onl
Only Minerva knowe what tonight
may bring.

SCA to Sponsor Show
Monday and Tuesday

A program of student talent given
for the benefit of SCA will be pre-
sented on the stage of the Madison
theatre Monday and Tuesday nights,
under the general direction of Fay
Scheer, ’40, general chairman.

Among the students to appear is
Ethel Cohen, ’41, who has often
sung to State college audiences. It
is expected that this novelty show
will be as great a success as last
year's presentation.

A part of the general admission
of twenty-five cents will be donated
to help send delegates to the Silver
Bay conference at Lake George. Last
year's conference was the ﬁrst one
open to men, and SCA officials are
anxious to continue this project.

The double feature will include
"Dark Victory" and “The Lady and
the Mob."

Seniors Will Wear Gowns

As customary, the seniors are to
wear their caps and gowns to the
two remaining assembly meetings

Assembly to Act
On New Budget
For Ensuing Year

installation of New Officers;
'Kelly to Wield Gavel
for Year 1939-40

 

John Edge, '39, will preside in the
year’s final Student assembly today
at 11:10 o'clock. The newly-tapped
members of Myskania will be seated
on the stage with the present mem—
bers. The ﬁrst order of business will
be the presentation of the student
budget for discussion and approval.

The inauguration of the coming
year’s student association officers
will follow. After their installation
the new president, Lloyd Kelly, will
take charge of the remainder of the
program.

The Finance Board, having com-
pleted its hearings for the year, will
submit its recommendations for the
student association budget. As a
result of the special conference con-
ducted with Dr. A. R. Brubacher,
president. Miss Helen Moreland,

 

idean of students, and Dr. Caroline
‘Croasdale, professor of hygiene, the
,committee has recommended an in-
creasc of the student tax to $12 per
student. This increase includes a $1
:assessment for the Pcdugoguc and a
$1 assessment for an inﬁrmai‘y fund.
:The total request of the activities
this year was less than last year,
except for the Pcdagoguc and the
inﬁrmary funds. The activities to—
gether received 85% of the budget
money.

Since the inﬂi'mary fund is to be
increased, the beneﬁt each student
is allowed from it will be increased
from $10 to $15. In addition 10 that
aid available already, this beneﬁt
also provides for guild nursing care
and for broken glasses at the discre-
tion of Dr. Croasdalc. The student
will now be able to obtain $15 pro—
lcctlon for $2.50 instead of $10 pro-
Lcclion for $1.50. Mr. Clarence Hid-
lcy, assistant professor of history,
is very much in favor of incorporat—
ing the $1 misc for [he inl'n'mal'y.

budgets follow:

Protest of Students
Restores Budget Cut

Our lobby proved to be about
50% effective. A portion of the
budget has been restored—in fact,
$11,357 has been voted in the sup-
plementary budget during the
final session of the legislation last
week.

The total reduction in our
budget amounted to $11,270. The
partial cut means a reduction in
faculty salaries which are already
low and also a reduction in the
maintenance for the school.

At the present time, according
to latest reports, there will be no
reduction in the number of fresh-
men that will enter next year.
