STATE COLLEGE NEWS, MAY 26, 1939

Pardon. Mr. John Porter Edge!
~Real Rivalry Score Is 301/2-17%)

— O
CONTRARY TO THE STATE-

MENT made by Mr. John Porter
Edge on the night of May 19
(Moving-up Day to you), the rivalry
score between the sophomore and
freshman classes was not and is not
27% to 17%l According to John,
(a math major—tch, tchl) a mistake
was made somewhere, sometime,
somehow in determining the totals—
and it is therefore with great pleas-
ure that the STATE COLLEGE News
rectifies the mistake:

The correct, official, unadulter-
ated score was and is: 30% to 17%.
Short pause while members of the
reading audience cheer, boo, or turn
the page. For those of you who
demand proof, listen my children
and you shall bear a brief history
of rivalry (the official kind) at
State during the year ’38-'39. So
get out those pencils and rulers,
and start checking carefully.

Way, way back last October, Cam-
pus day saw the sophomores gain-
ing 3 points for men’s pushball and
2 points for women's athletic events,
while the freshmen were awarded
1 point for women’s athletic events.
There followed a long lull in rival-
ry affairs. Then Thursday evening
during the last week of the ﬁrst
semester, the sophs threw a bomb-
shell by ﬂnding 1942's banner (for
which feat 5 points were given
on Moving-up day). Next day came
the assembly debate on "steadiness"
in all its aspects, and the elated
sophs gained 2% more points.

Women’s basketball furnished the
class of ’41 with 3 additional points,
and the rivalry sing in assembly
gave them 2% points.

 

Then came a great turning of the
tables, worms, or luck—as you will.
The frosh emerged victorious from
the men's basketball game, and thus
accumulated 3 more points. Mc-
Kown’s Grove saw them also carry
off the men’s 3 baseball points, al-
though the soph women again helped
balance the score by gaining 3
points from the female baseball bat-
tle. In football, after twa tie games,
the frosh pulled down 3 more points
by coming out on top in the third
onslaught.

But, alas! The class of ’41 once
more came through. The discovery
of the mascot brought them 5 extra
points, which were also awarded on
Moving-up day. Then, determined
for revenge, the excited frosh pro-
ceded to walk away with a little
rope as well as the 3 tug-of—war
points.

You know as well as we do the
story of May 18 and 19: men's push-
ball—2 points for the frosh; women's
athletic events—2 points for them
there, too; stunt—3 points for the
sophs; and sing—1% points apiece
for the red and blue alike,

So there it is—add it up! And
if you can get anything but 30%—
17%, well— just show usll We’re
willing to be convinced.

And now that all official mathe-
matics are cleared up, we find that
the fresh follow are athletically
superior to their rivals, but that in
nearly all the women’s events the
sophomore Amazons seem to have
the edge on the gals of ’42. And
thus, fellow citizens, ends rivalry till
the arrival of 1943 and its little green

 

banner.

To Conduct Reunion

‘All Neckties to 60’
Say. Eddie and Toya

Two wide-eyed people went on
a rampage last Tuesday morning.
They were out for blood—I mean
ties,——dripping from the ends of a
long, long, silvery pair of shears.

Toya and Eddie decided to
make a rag mat from old rags——
new neckties found around the
necks of activities-minded stu-
dents. So—giving ample warning
to those who shall enter the ac-
tivities office, they set out for
their rag-ties.

And did they ﬁnd them—and
how. Victim after victim walked
into the spider's net that they had
spun. With the help of Borneo-
haired Lenny, our scalpers went
to work.

As the “elite” walked into the
office, Eddie grabbed their ties
while Toya cut them off. Polka
dots. red and blue striped, black,
blue, in fact all colors of the rain.
bow were exhibited in the line
that was strung accross the activ-
ities office.

Len Fennel] and Band
In Play for Seniors

The Senior class has been very
fortunate in securing the services
of Len Fenneli and his orchestra in
play for the Senior Ball on June
19. Fennell’s great band has had
a continuous run of more than
ﬁve years at the George F. John-
son Pavilion in Johnson City and
has shown up well in comparison
to the finest swing bands of the
country that play there weekly.

The band is distinctive in that
it does not play all of its num-
bers in its own style. Instead it
uses the best arrangements that
Shaw, Goodman, Clinton, Dorsey
and others have made, such as “Be-
gin the Beguine," “What Is This
Thing Called Love," “Marie,” “Sugar.
foot Stomp,” “One o‘Clock Jump,"
“Song of India," “Shoot the Likker
to Me John Boy"—-just to mention a
few are some of the best swing things
Fennel] plays in the style we have
heard many times. This year’s Senior

News to Sponsor
Informal Party

“Statezapoppin” Answers
Requests for Socials
During Summer

The Summer School News is
sponsoring an informal party in the

,Commons of Hawley hall on Friday
evening, July 21, from eight to

twelve o‘clock. Admission is twenty-
five cents per person, and all stu-
dents. faculty members and their
friends are urged to come.

The purpose of the party is to re-
vive the spirit of campus life and
enthusiasm which seems to have
been dormant dm‘ing the summer
sessions here at State college. So
many students move from class to
class for six hot weeks, making few
personal contacts either with fei-
low-students or with members of
the faculty. Those students who
commute, or those who live in
rooms other than group houses, are
apt to find themselves with no op-
portunity for social contacts. Those
students who live in a group house
find that their acquaintanceship is
largely delimited by the walls of
that particular group house. In
order to bring together into a. more
compact body the men and women
engaged in summer study at the
College, and in order to foster a
spirit of friendliness during the
Summer Session, We announce this
informal "get-together," or what we
call “S'l‘A’l‘EZAPOPPlN.”

Music and room for dancing will
be supplied throughout. the evening,
tables and playing cards will be
available, and there will be every
opportunity for idle, or not-so-idie,
chatter. Several of the faculty hav i
already expressed their intention of
attending, in the hope of meeting
their students in an informal at-
mospherc.

Those who desire refreshments
will find coca-cola for sale at the
usual five cents a bottle. So dress
for a good time. bring your own cig-
arettes, if you will, and Join the
fun.

Carnegie Corporation which does
the purchasing directly. For this
purpose an office is maintained at
the University of Michigan library.
Lists must be carefully prepared by
the librarian with complete biblio-
graphical information. According to

HEADS SUMMER SESSION

Dean’s Office Releases
’39 Regisﬂthationliigures

Present Enrollment Decrease
Result of Four Years’
Normal Course

A decrease of 131 students in en-
rollment over 1938 at New York
State College for Teachers is indi—
cated by final reports from Dr. Mil-
ton G. Neison, Dean. The total
figure of 1939 is made up of 836
women and 553 men.

Dean Nelson attributes the de-
crease to the offering by Normal
Schools of fourth year work, since
the drop has been primarily in
Normal graduates. There has also
been a slight drop in undergrad-
uates. while the graduate student
body, numbering 724 this summer,
“compares favorably with 1938," ac-
cording to the Dean.

The all time high for State Col-
lege summer sessions was in 1936
when 1587 were registered.

State College has attracted ten
non-resident students representing
seven states. The student who has
travelled farthest to attend the sum-
mer session is Lawrence Lacey, of
Houston, Texas. Other out of state
students are Edna Dumschatt,
Waterbury, Connecticut; Martha

- ’l‘rossen, Mishawaka, Indiana; Ed-

ward Fahcy, Dalton, Massachusetts;
Ethel Parsons, Bernardston, Massa-
cllusctis; Alice Rozier, West Palm
Beach, Florida; Catherine Hinckley,
Burlington, Vermont; D o r 0 th y
Wolfe, Lancaster, Pennsylvania;
David Souders. Lancaster, Pennsyl-
vania; and Anna F. Petty, Cora-
opolis, Pennsylvania.

The most. popular department ac—
cording to registration figures is the
History Department, followed by the
English and Education Departments,
oil of which have unusually large
enrollments. The largest single
class is Education 103, “Psycholo-
gicai Study 01’ Problem Behavior.”

Serving these 1939 summer ses-
,slon students is a staff composed of
sixty—eight faculty members and
seven iulminlstratlve office r s.
l'I‘WCllLY'Lwo of the thirty-six visit-
?lug professors and twelve of the
llhlrty-lwo members of the regular
lcollogc faculty here this summer
lhuve Ph.D. degrees. Seven visitors
,uud fourteen regular faculty mem-
.I)crs have M. A. degrees.

The thirty—six visiting professors
come from widely separated points
of lilo compass, and represent in-
stitutions in seventeen states out-
lﬁlill‘ New York. Members of the
rogulm' sluif of such nationally
known i'olli‘gcs and universities as
Vussur, Brown, Wisconsin, Prince-
ilon. and Michigan are at State this
summer.

The summer session extends to
August. 16. Classes will end on
{August 14. but examinations are
announced for the remaining two
duys.
