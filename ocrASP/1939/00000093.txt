Complacent Scholars

The greatest danger that confronts formal educa-
tion and the American mania for degree hunting is
an attitude of smugness. We need to be jostlcd
into the realization that there still exist original
minds among that group which we so frequently
brand as the laymen. Though they may never
have had a single “course,” which in many cases
may be a. substitute for original thought, they may
still be valuable members of society alert to the
basic principles that we can’t see for the forest.

Sometimes these laymen arc to be found an ng
waiters in a restaurant. Another may be a Ver—
mont rustic. l recall one such person who, though
he had never learned to write, should have been
teaching philosophy in a great university. it is
perfectly possible that he would not have been so 
wise had he pursued a formal education.

We may wave these individuals aside with thc
thought that they are exceptions to the gcncral
rule but even that suggests an clcmcut of smugncss
that few of us will admit.

 

Attention, Smokers!

Because a member of the group at Spencer Hall
,was careless with a cigarette, a fire that might have
been disastrous occurred last Monday. It marked
the fourth consecutive summer that a conflagration
has occurred in the vicinity from the same cause.
it is surprising that there are only four.

With so many indulging in thc cigarcttc habit, i
it is important that we use care in otn' protection 
of property. A single match or a single butt may ,
cause irreparable damage. it is wcll that wc tnkc ‘
warning from the accident at Spencer hall and use ‘
a little more common sense than has been our habit 
in the past. )

 

'l‘hcrc are four kinds of pcoplc, tlu‘cc of which
are to he avoidcd and thc fourth cultivatctl; lhosc 
who don’t know what thcy don’t know; thosc who
know that they don’t know; thosc who don’t know
that they know; and those who [Wow that lltcy

[Believe - Do You?

 

 

 

(With this issue the SUMMER SCHOOL N Ews will
print the first of a series of “Credos” which will
give the members of the faculty an opportunity to
express briefly their ideas of what education should
be. This week’s “Credo” is that of Mr. Louis C.
Jones, instructor of English.)

I believe in the people, the common people.

I believe in a government which gives those people
the greatest possible opportunity to make of their
lives what they desire.

I believe that the best way a government can pro-
vide this opportunity is through an educational sys-
tem that helps every child to find his ways of work
and his most satisfying ways of pleasure.

I believe that a teacher should be a guide to these
children, not a drill master,—tho’ I am aware of cer-
tain values in certain drills.

I believe in the value of the best traditions of the
past, especially in those cultural traditions which re-
assert the dignity of the human race.

I also believe in an education which makes each
student and teacher deeply aware of the present: its
great accomplishments and its tragic failures.

I believe in an education which teaches a child
how to achieve economic independence, but an edu-
cation which aims only to do that has merely trained
a cog in the industrial and commercial machine. It
should provide him with an understanding of a wide
variety of cultural and intellectual interests, so that
from the many he may find some few to make his
own life more endul‘able to himself and others.

I believe that a teacher should have an inviolable
personal life as well as a professional life. The admin—
istrator who expects his teachers to give their entire
lives to the school is a fool. for a teacher must have
time to build his own life so that he may remain a
person, and a person worthy of his responsibility.

I believe a teacher should be himself. not what
other people think a teacher ought to be. He should
think for himself and. within reasonable limits. speak
for himself, even if those are not the words expected
from him.

I believe that when a teacher enters the school

I building he must cease to be conscious of any differ-

ences among his students in race, creed. or station.
If he can not forget those differences in his treat-
ment of students then let him go out and be a banker
or garbage collector, but not a teacher.

I believe that a teacher's first loyalty is to the
people of the state. and to no single political, reli-
gious, or racial group or institution within the state.

LOUIS C. JONES.

 

Communications

 

To the Editor:

The welcome “at-home" fccling glvcn visiting stu—
dents in New York State Teachers Collcgo in Albany
is very pleasing. The friendly spirit existing between
the students and faculty is a bit unusual for such a
large student body; nevertheless, it crcatcs an environ-
ment that makes work anoynblc and very profitable.
It is so pleasant to be recognized by a strident or pro-
t'cssor when mct tn the corridor. on the campus. or
in other common meeting places. True, we cannot
cxpcct to bc cullcd by munc. at least not in the first
few days, but ft is gratifying to bc rccognlzod as a
member of the group.

The, rcgular students, as well as those who have
studied here in former years. are kind in giving direc-
tions, answering qucstlons and explaining details
which help the stranger to become orientated.

As a whole State 'l‘cnchcrs' College is a little com-
munity enjoying common interests. It deserves gran
praise for its t‘ricndlhwss. which will send many of
us away at lite and of six Weeks having made many
new acquaintances and friends. This commendable
spirit sets an example that might well be t'ollowrd by
other institutions of hlghcr learning.

(This your State ('ol/cge has a
faculty made up of man y interest-
ing members who’d like to know
their students, and whom the lat-.
tcr would enjoy knowing. We are
presenting two of l/lf’iil today.)

If you are an English major orli
minor. you probably struggled!
through the survey course in English ‘
Literature at some time or other.
Dr. George K. Anderson. visiting in-i
structor from Brown University. is‘
in some ways responsible for this“
he is the author of the text that is1
used, The Litcralurc of England, ,

When asked for an interview and;
a picture, Dr. Anderson oxprcsscrh

obliged us. His faintly had gonct

picture for the vas.

Dr. Anderson will finish a new
book soon, This Ut'tu'ruliotl. He will
go to England on his sabbatical leavet
which comes in a year or two. Hc‘
has already studied early English!
literature in England twice before. 1

Although Dr. Anderson has been
at Brown since 1927. his teaching
experience has been varied. He was
graduated from Harvard in 1920 and‘
since then has taught in that col-"
lege and in the George Washington!
University in Washington. He has
spent his summer sessions at the
Bread Loaf School which is the‘
English division of Middlebury Col-l
lege, and State college where he,
taught English courses last sum-t

Mr. Lionel C. Pearson is a most,
delightful person. This comes asl
somewhat of a shock to onc who:
has seen his name in the catalogum
for “Professor of Classics” is, after.
all, rather impressive. He has taught
at Dalhousle University in Halifax.
and at Yale. He was born in Lon-j
don. and prepared for Oxford at“
Amplct'orth.

Having travelled cxtcnsivcly in
Europe, he is most anxious to rc-
vlsit Italy. Hts intcrcsts, otttsidc

not appreciate thc nllcgcd lltcrnturc
of America, nor does he understand
the enthusiasm shown in politics
and football. He misses his tcn.
and he also misses lltc English gar—

According to Mr. l’cnrson thc \‘ll'—

this country is very foolish. inasmuch
as they are a definite aid to mnny‘
other subjects.

Co-op Has Nineteen-year Career
Since Origin in Janitor’s Office

Established in September, 1920,
the State College Co-op has been
steadily growing in service to stu-
dents and faculty. That it will be
open each year in its usual place
with its shelves laden with supplies
has come to be taken for granted
by many students.

Few realize that the Co-op began
its career across the hall in the tiny

|dark room now used as the janitor's

office. Few. crowding in to buy
books at the beginning of each ses—
sion, stop to think what a boon it
has been to professors. It was pri—
marily to save them time, annoy—
ance. and frequent money loss that
the book store was first established.
according to Olga Hampel Briggs
who wrote a brief history of the
shop on its 10th anniversary.

The first manager of the Co-op
was Miss Helen T. Fay. then assis-
tant in the history department, now
nationally known in publishing cir-
cles and tncmbcr of the staff of
Holiday House. publishers of excep—
tionally beautiful children's books.
Under her leadership the shop prov—
ed so successful that it was decided
that the College Y.W.C. A. could
take it over. But for three years
under this arrangement its reputa-
tion declined and its debts. increased
to such an extent that Miss Fay had
tO be called back to rescue it. Thru
her indefatigable efforts the Co-op
not only rc-cstabllshcd its credit
but also became in its present quar-

ters a model for similar bookstores
in many other colleges.

Since May. 1937, Miss Margaret
Burnette, '36, has been managing the
Co-op with the assistance of Miss
Barbara Kelly. '35. Both attended
the convention of the National Asso—
ciation of College Stores at St. Louis
this year.

Today. continuing the ideals of
Miss Fay. the Co-op staff and stu—
dcnt assistants are constantly striv-
ing to gratify collegiate needs and
desires. Their services are offered
with intelligent friendliness and
ready cooperation.

The Co-op has been the scene of
many thrilling experiences for State
College students. It was a gala day,
for instance, when Christopher Mor-
Icy dedicated the “Haunted Book-
shop." that secluded nook of the
Co-op, replica of a corner Of the
original Haunted Bookshop. where
one may read in quiet and comfort.
Mr. Morley brought with him a bag
of walnuts which he autographed
and distributed to the “nutty peo-
ple” who would spend a fine Satur-
day afternoon in a bookstore.

Among the CO-op's other distin-
guished guests, students and faculty
will remember Frederic Melchior of
Publislicr's ch/rly. Robert Frost.
Dorothy Lathrop, Carl Carmcr. John
Lomax and many others.

Truly, in the words of the late
Professor Kirkland of the Education
Department, the “Co-op is more than

a supply house or a bookshop; it is.

a place of intriguing suggestion.
Two minutes there always remind
one of the good things he once
mcant to write; and of the better
things he still means to read."

Dean Announces Hours

Donn Nelson announces that he
is in his Office for consultation with
studcnts from 8:00 A. M. until 1:00
P. M. cach day and at other times
by appointment. thn the doors

Residence Halls
House Students

Summer session students are mak-
ing use of practically the same hous-
ing facilities that are available to
the regular session students. Ten
houses are open to women students
and eight to men while the visiting
faculty are occupying North Hall,
on Ontario Street, and various
apartments vacated by regular ses-
sion faculty. according to Miss Mary
Morton, Supervisor of Housing.

From the twelve sorority houses
used in regular session, only six are
opened for residence this summer.
Those six are: Delta Omega, Kappa
Delta, Chi Sigma Theta, Beta Zeta,
Phi Delta and Sigma Alpha. All
four of the fraternity houses are
open: Kappa Delta Rho, Edward
Eldred Potter Club, Kappa Beta and
Sigma Lambda Sigma. Four addi-
tional houses are available to women
students: Newman Hall, Wren Hall,
Maison Francoise, and the Main and
South halls of the Alumni Residence
Halls. Other group houses for men
are Avalon Hall. College House,
Spencer Hall and Pierce Hall, the
latter of the Alumni Residence Halls.

Miss Morton also has announced
women's residence regulations. All
group houses close at twelve mid-
night, every night, and men callers
may remain until that hour. Per-
mission may be obtained from the
.housemother or head resident; in
charge of the house to remain out
later. All non-resident students
registered at New York State Col-
lege for Teachers during regular
session are required to live in ap-
proved houses during summer school.
