Mohawk Festival
Resumes Activity

Charles Coburn HeadsGroup
in Seven Week Season
at Schenectady

 

Sixteen miles from Albany at
Union college, Schenectady, there is
now playing the only professional
dramatic organization chartered by
the Board of Regents of the Uni-
versity of the State of New York.

Modeled after the Malvern and
Stratford-on-Avon festivals, the
theatre has been playing annually
to more than 90,000 spectators from
every state in the union since the
beginning of the venture in 1935.

Charles Coburn has charge of the
entire project.

Prominent men of the theatre like
Clayton Hamilton and Walter Prit-
chard Eaton have lectured at the
festival; plays including Lysislrata
and High Tor have been offered
in previous seasons. This year the
repertoire extends from Taming of
[he Shrew to the two season New
York success, Our Tmml.

The festival idea includes a train-
ing school for students of the drama
who attend classes each morning
during the seven weeks‘ drama

course. In the afternoon these stu- 1‘30 to 4:00 oclock in mom 12 of

the summer course present their

and act bit parts in the major pro-
ductions. The enrollment of the
Institute has been limited in the
past to 50 members.

In praising the Union college
drama festival Owcn D. Young,
Regent of the University of the
State of New York, commented: “It
is significant that the great
Foundations such as the Carnegie
and Rockefeller are realizing this
trend and supporting such activ-
ities as this." The Carnegie Cor-
poration, after the first year of the
festival, gave  substantial grant"
to the Institute for a period of three
years.

cht Tuesday. July 25, the topic
under discussion will be, “To group
or not to group." The following
poian will be considered:

€1.15 it desirable to establish
classes to accommodate the abil-
ities of pupils better equipped men-
tally than the average, or in a
democratic system of education is
the average pupil entitled to the
stimulation that class contact with
the upper level can give. even
though the brighter pupil must
therefore go at a slower pace?

b. Can homogeneous grouping be
justified upon any basis other than
learning rate?

This discussion group again claims
the attendance of summer students
who have been dropping into these
bull sessions for the past couple of
summers.

La Maison Francalse

Opens This Autumn

La Maison Francoise, a new resi-
dcncc hall for women, located at
024 Myrtle Avcnuc, will be opened
ncxt fall under the direction of
Monslcur and Madame Millet.

The distinguishing feature about
La Maison is that only French will
be spoken in its halls. Each stu-
dent, upon entrance, must sign a
pledge to speak only French while
in the house or on the grounds.
Aided by Miss Dobbin. the students
will spend one hour each day study-
ing the elements of every day
speech.

For the first little in their lives,
many young ladies will be lost
for words. Just imagine a young
mun approaching the reception desk
of the dormitory and stumbling
through, "Vouioz yous bicn dire a
Mudcmoiscllc Jones (1110 Je suis lot."
And then Miss Joucs rushes down
the stairs only to bc stumped for
words on meeting her beau.
Undoubtedly the cxpcrimcut by
the French Department will prove
successful. but then the Sociology
Department will have a new prob-
lem on its lmnds—~whut to do with
willing~to~tulk, but silent belles.
