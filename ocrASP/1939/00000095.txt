_  SUMMER- NEWS“ .-

 

 

With palpitating hearts and
sweating broWs, ﬁfteen prospective
freshmen enter the halls of State
College every day for the ﬁnal tests
of their ﬁtness, for acceptance in a
teachers’ college.‘ The roll of ap-
plicants,.already cut down by schol-
astic-_ standards for admission, will
b'svfurther depleted by the results
of personality, speech and physical
examinations.

fur. William. G. Hardy, instructor

makes all speech tests, stresses the
importance of eliminating those
who, although boasting Regents'
averages of over 90%, are not pos-
sessed of the personal and physical
qualities essential to good teaching.
“The ability to communicate the
ng'lis‘h language clearly and pleas-
antly.” says Mr. Hardy, "is essen-
' _ .f' Whatever else he teaches, the
teacher! sets‘ an example of good or
 speaking before his students.
Forthisreason,~a careful analysis is
made of the speech characteristics
and the speaking apparatus of each
prospective freshman. Any serious
defects which cannot be corrected
by means of the College clinical
facilities serve to disqualify the
‘ pects.
Successful. in his speech tests, the
psrspiring applicant proceeds to in-
terﬂews before three other impos-
ingimembers of the College faculty.

amined in'the light of personal hab-
its and characteristics, yet the whole '

 

process is made as pleasant as pos-
sible by the obviouilly friendly in-
tentions of the variolls interviewers.
Among those who enjoy the pleas-
ure, or perhaps bear the burden
with a smile, of these private chats,
are Dr. J. Allen Hicks, Dr. William
M. French, Dr. Carleton E. Power,
Dr. Ralph A. Beaver, Dr. Harry
Birchenough, Dr. Ralph G. Clausen,
Dr. C. Currien Smith, Dr. Donnal V.
Smith, Mr. Chester J. Terrill, Mr.
'Harrison M. ‘Terwiiliger, and Miss
Katherine E. Wheeling.

Thence goes the freshman pros-
pect to one of the staff doctors for
a thorough physical examination,
the men being taken care of by Dr.
Earl J. Dorwaldt, the women by Dr.
Matie E. Green.

And finally—to the Dean himself,
Dr. Milton G. Nelson, where all in-
terview records are gathered and
interpreted as carefully as possible.

Our applicant has reached the
end of a busy day, alternating spas-
modicaily between hope and doubt.
If he succeeds, he can look forward
to a college career of work and fun
here at State College. If he fails,
he can console himself with the
knowledge that he has discovered
his lack of fitness for teaching be-
fore putting in four years of futile
preparation, only to find that there

 

. Chit-Chat And Sherbet
Highlight Dean’s Party
Dean and Mrs. Nelson inform-

ally welcomed all the‘ mem-
bers of the faculty and staff at

va"'receptiOn in the Ingle Room
' of ‘ the Alumni Residence Halls.
‘Monday, July 10.: About one
hundred resident and visiting
faculty members chatted and
ate sherbet with the college
staff.

Two interesting observations
deserve comment. First, the
number of visitors slightly over-
balances that of the resident
faculty. Secondly, the faculty
enjoyed themselves finding peo—
ple who knew someone else. In
other words it was one of those,
“Do you remember?” or “Did
you ever meet?" evenings.

Through the efforts of Miss Bur-
nette of the Co-op, State college is
provided with a most interesting,
display of textbooks for all courses;
which is being held in the Activities

ones constructed at nearly all of
the larger schools for teacher train-
ing during the summer. as well as
at the educational conferences.

Each of the companies J. P. Lip-
pincott Co., John C. Winston Co.,
McGraw-Hill, L. W. Singer 00..

Resumes Activity-

Charles Coburn HeadsGroup
in Seven Week Season
at Schenectady

Sixteen miles from Albany at,
Union college, Schenectady, there is.
now playing the only professional
dramatic organization chartered by
the Board of Regents of the Uni-
versity of the State of New York.

Modeled after the Malvern and
Stratford-on-Avon festivals, the
theatre has been playing annually
to more than 90,000 spectators from
every state in the union since the
beginning of the venture in 1935.

Charles Coburn has charge of the
entire project.

Prominent men of the theatre like
Clayton Hamilton and Walter Prit-
chard Eaton have lectured at the
festival; plays including Lysislmm
and High Tor have been offered
in previous seasons. This year the
repertoire extends from Taming of
tho Sin-cw to the two season New
York success. Our Town.

The festival idea includes a train-
ing school for students of the drama
who attend classes each morning
during the seven weeks" drama
course. In the afternoon these stu-
dents take part in designing, light-
ing, and acting along with the pro-
fessional actors who present the
play. In the period 01‘ a single
summer the studcnt-upprcnticcs
have the opportunity of working
with 40 to 50 professionals from
New York and Hollywood.

From time to time those who take
the summer course present their
own versions of thc curran play
and act bit. parts in the major pro—
ductions. The enrollment 01' the
Institute has bccn limited in the
past to 50 members.

In praising the Union colicgc
drnmu festival Owen D. Young,
chcni ol‘ the University of the
State oi" New York, connncntcd: “IL
is significant that the grout
Foundations such as the Carnegie
and Rockci‘cllcr are realizing this

ities as this." The Carnegie Cor-
