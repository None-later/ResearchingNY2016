Library School Tea
' llas Guest Speaker

Former Manager of 00-01)
Addresses Library Group

Miss Helen Fay, former manager
of the College Co-op, who is now
connected with Holiday House, Inc.,
was the guest speaker last Wednes-
day at the second in a series of
library school teas designed to ac-
quaint future librarians with prom-
inent professionals in the book
world. Her subject, "The Making of
Books," was interestingly illustrated
and well received. I

At the first of these teas. MISS
L. Marion Moshier, supervisor of
Adult Education in New York State,
spoke on the various ways the Adult
Education Department can help the
school and public librarian. She
mentioned nine points for the li-
brarian to bear in mind if she would

increase her usefulness to her 11- t

and community, stressing es-
32mm that a librarian should free
herself from the “tricks of the
trade" and think for herself. She
urged librarians to make their li-
braries dynamic by cooperating with
churches, civic industries, and clubs.
Miss Moshier closed her talk by
saying that if it came to a choice of
belonging to one of two groups, far
more satisfaction would be gained
by belonging to the “group that
did" rather than to the “group that

Social Activity

News Arranges Second Party
For Next Friday Night
At Eight-Thirty

Another informal party will be
held for the summer session students
and faculty, on Friday evening,
August 4, from 8:30 to 12:00 o'clock
in the Commons of Hawley hall at
the college. The admission charge
will be twenty-five cents per' person.
payable at the door.

This second affair of the summer
is in answer to numerous requests
received by the News staff since
the success of Statczapoppin last
Friday night. At that time. ap-
proximately 140 members of the
faculty and the student body gather-
ed in the Commons for a pleasant
evening of dancing and cards. Music
was supplied by a victrola and loud
speaker system. Tables and cards
were available in one section of the
room for those who preferred a less
strenuous activity than dancing.
Many of those present were content
to circulate about the room talking
with friends and new acquaintances.

The faculty members who were
present entered enthusiastically into
the spirit of the party. organizing
bridge games and conversing with
students throughout the evening.
Next week a larger number of pro-
i'cssm's and instructors is expected
to attend, since the Syracuse guid-
ance conference took place last
weekend.

The chapcrones for Statczapoppin
were Miss Mary Morton, Mr. and
Mrs. William G. Hardy, and Mr.
William Clark.

The party next Friday night will
offer the same type of entertain-
ment. However. a new arrangement
is being planned so that those who
play cards will be somewhat less
annoyed by the noise of music and
dancing. As before, ice-cold coco-
cola will be available for five cents
a bottle.

Albany’s Libraries

State and City Libraries
Assist Summer Students

 

 

The College Library has a large
and varied collection of books that
is comparable with any college of
its size. Nevertheless, out-of—town
students may be unaware of the
other excellent library facilities
Albany Offers.

The State Library in the Educa-
tion building on Washington Ave-
nue has a large number of titles in
many departments and is especially
strong in the fields of Education
and American History. While stu-
dents may not borrow directly from
the State Library, they may obtain
such material by leaving definite
requests at the loan desk in the
College Library. Only books that
are not available at the College
Library will be borrowed from the
State Library. However, material
to be used in the reading room of
the State Library may be reserved
for two weeks.

The Albany Public Library. lo-
cated at Washington Avenue and
Dove Street, will loan books to
State College students upon presen-
tation of an application blank en-
dorsed by the College Library. These
blanks may be procured either at
the College or at the Albany Public
Library. The nearest branch is Pine
Hills on Madison Avenue at Ontario
Street.

More Positions Secured
The Appointment Bureau of New
York State College for Teachers
lists the names of five graduates
who have been given 1930-40 teach-
ing positions during the past week.
Those who have been appointed
are: Frank Petronls, '35, commerce.
Dobb’s Ferry; Mildred Moshlcr, ’30.
commerce, Morrisvillo; Mary Spare-
cine, '30. English and history, Bea-
ver Falls; George Waddlngton, grad-

The question of censorsz has
become a vital issue in many schools;
some parents have recently threat-
ened to protest to the State depart-
ment about books made available
to their children in our schools.
Such books as Drums Along the
Mohawk, Gone With the Wind,
Good Earth, and stories by Stein-
beck have been the subject of heat-
ed controversy within the past year.

Both sides of the question have
earnest supporters among parents
and educators in this state. The
more basic principle is involved in
the argument of whether there
should be censorship of any type
whatsoever in public education.
Many foreign countries, notably
Germany. preserve strict supervision
over the offerings of their schools
and libraries. The American tradi-
tion has been one of “hands off"
to a large extent. But this question
of censorship has two obvious sides
to it, as well as a number of degrees
of moderation within each view-
point, and it should be a lively sub-
ject for debate.

Superintendents, principals, lib-
rarians. and English teachers, es-
pecially, are urged to come to this
tea and to make their contribution
to the cause of better understanding
of this interesting problem.

Cut in Budget Neocssitstes
Drop in Registration-
For F all Term

Dean Nelson recently announced
that the registration for the incom-
ing Freshman class at State College
will be limited to approximately
250 students. During the past six
years, freshman registration has
been approximately 300 students.

This decrease in the number of
entering freshmen is a result or the
action taken by the Board of Regents
and the cut in the State Budget.
The only transfers to be admitted
will be three year Normal School
and college graduates. This group
will be about 185, as it was last year.
The number in the graduating
classes or the coming years will be
decreased by the number of students
who are forced to leave because of
low scholastic average, high number
of cuts. and financial reasons. These
vacancies will not be filled by stu-
dents who intend to enter classes
here after two or three years in
another college.

Under the new system. the class
of '43 will consist of approximately
170 women and 80 men. This two
to one ratio of men and women
has been the proportion admitted
for the past four years. The class of
'39 was the first class to include 100
men and 200 women. In previous
freshman classes the registration
consisted of 50 men and 250 women.
This decrease in registration to
250 students will strengthen the
aim of the administration toward s.
higher standard for this college. A
degree that is earned. whether in
regular session or in summer school,
will be more cherished now than in
previous years when entrance re-,
quirements were not so strict.

0n the other hand, the limited
number of students to be admitted
has extensive implications for the
regular session year of 1039-1940.
The school budget based on a system
of student tax collections. will be out
$600 as a result of the decrease of
50 students. The budgets for all the
organizations and the medical fund
has been made out on a basis of 300
