Summer Opportunity

I Here we are—-fourteen hundred or more of us—
gathered together for six weeks of concentrated
'work. Most of us have been working hard all year
,and feel we need a rest. We should like to be ab-
sorbing sunshine in one of the thousands of glorious
vacation spots this country offers. Instead we
are 'here to absorb intellectual ultra. violet rays
from the country’s professorial elite, and we should
do Well to count the benefits to be derived therefrom.

.Many students fail to recognize the obvious
advantages of summer school. The staff is varie-
gated and cosmopolitan and stimulating. We have
a chance to rub elbows with important people in
the teaching profession from all parts of the country.
It is true that classes come every day, that the
weather is hot, that it does not seem the time of
year for books, nevertheless, let us try to appreciate
what summer school offers. Particularly if you
come from a small community, where opportunities
for intellectual development are slight, you should
go away with wider horizonsﬂa better teacher,
citizen, anti person.

Besides the intellectual offerings of the summer
session, there is the further opportunity to renew old
friendships, to make new and stimulating contacts
with other people, and to broaden no.1 awaken
interests which will increase professional ability.

A further word of advice. Those of us who
have been here before at summer school know that
the great majority of students who come are earnest,
hard working, conscientious people. The great
majority take full advantage of what the New York
State College for 'l‘cachers offers in the academic
way. But there are benefits that are neglected by
many even in that majority. (in and see your
instructors. 'l‘alk over your problems as a teacher
with them. You will find them a sympathetic, un—
derstanding and helpful group. And don’t con-
fine your talk to professional shop-talk. Talk to
them as man to man or as woman to woman.
Whatever your problem, the stuff is here to listen,
eager to listen. All those names in the catalogue
with l’h. ll’s after them rcprcscnt men and women
like yourselves. ()ur contention is this: that after
six weeks of summer school, if you have failed to
add to your list of jriemls one member of the
faculty, you have in a way failed to take all that
summer school offers. if you can add to academic
benefits one new friend you 112ch truly profited.
Who Would venture to say which is more valuable 7-
the intellectual advancement or the friend?

 

SUMMER SCHOOL NEWS, JULY 28, 1939

 

I Believe - Do You?

 

 

 

For comparison and contrast with previous
Faculty Credos, THE NEWS presents a Student’s
Idea! of Education.

I believe that education must serve a three-fold
purpose in a democratic country. Consequently, any
curriculum which looks directly to these ends is a
useful curriculum.

First—preparation for intelligent citizenship. That
implies some understanding of the individual's social
responsibility, and the problems contingent upon
that responsibility. It implies the achievement of a
sense of real values in an uncertain existence. To this
end. we must work with social education particularly—
studies of the world of yesterday. today, and to—
morrow. We must teach the skills necessary to on—
rich that intellectual background — reading, writing
and analysis. We must teach people to express them-
selves in words.

Second—an appreciation of man as man, and the
essential sacredness of the individual. To this end.
students must work and play together, learning co-
operation with aud liking for other people.

Third—the development of interests. No man is
so to be pltied as he who is bored with his work, and
has no absorbing avocations. He has never learned
the art of enjoyment.

Toward these three goals, then. education must;
point if it is to become more than an escape from
true reality for some, and an irritating grind for
others. Toward these ends the school must shape
its curriculum.

To the Editor:

I’m writing this letter to illustrate the way We suf-.
for Class pests who insist on leaving their mark on
the professor. I hope if you recognize yourself in these
examples, you will abandon such habits. Now here is
what I mean. . . .

“May I get personal? Are you married?”

Now. I ask you. Is that any kind of an inquiry to
make of a professor? Well, they do it every time.

Then we have these sun-tanned Amazons who try
to exhibit as much of their acquired sun-tan as decency
will permit—and more.

Then there are those who sit on the edge of their
seats, with their eyes glued on the clock, waiting for
the bell to ring. at which time they rush over people
and chairs in their way, grab hold of the edge of the
desk and try to get that personal touch from the
teacher tpolishiilg the old, or young, apple).

Curtain!

 

Tuesday [marked a perfect evening and Union
Campus proved the appropriate setting for the open-
llil' performance of George Adc's “The College Widow,"
starring Sally Eilers,

Goldcn-lutlrcd Miss Eilt'l's with her dashing viv-
aciousncss was swmet us the “college widow." It is
interesting to note that Miss Eilcrs Is a perpetual
student. "When she is not acting in u play, she
«limits for courses at the University of California in
Los Angclcs. Lust winter she took Will Durant's course
in the history of philosophy."

Ross Hertz, as “Stub” 'I‘alnutdgc, was outstanding
in portraying a very distinctive magnetic personality.

The lighting by Robert Brown was unusually cf-
t'cctive. notably the bonfire scene.

The colorful costttmcs and shnple sets blended
with the multltude of banners (R, P. I. not included),
creating the whole of Union Campus into a gay colle-
giate atmosphere.

Though the action of the play. directed by Jase
Ruben, takes- place in 1904 with the costumes and
music of the period. the attitudes, the enthusiasm
(for football). and expressions are as modern as our
“hero—factories" of today.

We hope you’re strong enough
after the heat of this week to hold a
paper and read it. Personally, we
feel that the effort involved is just
too much.

Dr. Vreeland's classes are wonder-
ing who “Genevieve” is, since he uses
that. name very freely in his soc—
iology lectures. They wonder if Dr.
Vreeland simply became tired of
using the “John and Mary" analogy
and switched to the more euphoneus
Genevieve, or whether that name
is the index to the great romance in
his life . . . ..

We've always admired Dr. French
as an exponent of physical culture,
thinking his uprightness most re-
markable. We learned that he is
also an able and avid exponent of
horticulture. So now we wonder if
that smooth tan is a result of gar-
dening or golfing . . . . .

We hear there’s a bridge tourna-
ment on in faculty circles. Dr.
Brown and Dr. Rogers, We are told.
are the Culbertson and Lenz of
State College, and as a team are in—
vincible. We've wondered what
caused that far-seeing expression in
Dr. Roger's eyes. Probably he's
envisioning the plays with which
he'll confound his opponents , . . .

We‘ve always been keen to know
just what the faculty do while we're
toiling away these afternoons. They
hie to the Ridgefield Club for relaxa-
tion. Tennis is the favorite sport
and they tell us Dr. Birchcnough
wields a wicked racket . . . . .

We noticed several students
around the halls and peristyles
muttering and gesticulaitng‘ wildly.
We weren't surprised for we've
come very close to it this summer.
We were relieved, however, to dis—
cover that these all belonged to Dr.
Howell‘s oral interpretation class
and were merely preparing an as—
signment. What a man!

We wanted to ask Mr. Kennedy
where we can obtain some of those
pills mentioned on the Huested
bulletin board. Those pills which
will “raise a volatile ferment of
vapid and languid brain cells." We
really feel the need . . . . . .

We went to the Sluiczapoppin
Friday night be :ause we were guar-
anteed the pleasure of meeting the
faculty. Well, we already knew the
three who were present. What hap-
pened, professors? Don‘t extra-cur—
ricular activities appeal? . . , . .

Among extra—curricular ttctlvitlos
this week—end Is the informal party
given by the girls at Moreland l-lull
tonight. Dr. St. John is invited. but
says he won't come as a chuperon,
as it’s too restricting and prohibitch
for a good time. We hope there
won't be too many restrictions.
though we do feel that wherever
Dr. St. John is, there won't be many
restrictions.

However, Wt‘. feel that restrictions
are necessary.~ospccially for would-

:be columnists. 'I‘horct‘orc, we’ll im—
pose some on ourselves and put. an

‘cnd to Idle chatter.

=ncsdny afternoons.

And then all
of us will be happy.

We wonder who is so nctivo in
the Journalism room from 2:00 to
4:30 o’clock on Tuesday and Wed-
Do you know.
Mr. Clark?

 

SUMMER SCHOOL NEWS, JULY 28, 1939

 

Meet
Your
Mentors

 

Dr. Geneva Drinkwater

“Cordial and friendly." "Very in-
teresting and stimulating." These
are Dr. Drinkwater‘s impressions of
Albany and of New York State Col-
lege for Teachers. She is genuine—
ly enthusiastic about becoming ac-
quainted with people and enjoys
making contacts with all types from
all localities.

The catalogue tells us that Dr.
Geneva Drinkwater secured her
Ph. D. from the University of Chi—
cago and that she is assistant pro-
fessor of history at Vassar college.
But it does not tell us such pertinent
facts as that she is a native of Mis—
souri and attended Stephens col-
lege and the University of Missouri.
Her graduate work was continued
at Bryn Mawr. She has taught at
colleges in Missouri and Minnesota
and at the University of North
Carolina.

Dr. Drinkwater's great absorbing
interest is Ancient and Medieval his-
tory. As a result she spent a year
and a half in Italy studying at the
Vatican school in Rome. and reading
Latin documents in the manuscript
writing of monks of the Middle
Ages, from the archives of the
Subiaco monastery.

She enjoys golf and horseback rid-
ing, and derives great pleasure from
her library of fine books and from
her many albums of phonograph
records of symphonic music.

This brief and entirely inadequate
presentation of Dr. Drinkwatei‘
should be amended to include some
mention of her warm, vividly at—
tractive personality. Her innate
charm was indicated in the first
paragraph, for she has found in
others what she is herself—“cordial
and friendly." "very Interesting and
stimulating."

Dr. Edward I. F. Williams

Psychologist, philosopher, writer.
amateur photographer and collector,
in other words. Dr. Williams. This
veritable miracle man has been in
our midst for several summers, but
few of us know what a fascinating
fund of knowledge he possesses.

Dr. Williams is interested in opera,
symphony and the drama; the lat-
ter. in his opinion, is developing
more here than abroad. He enjoys
traveling. has been in Mexico, Can-
ada. and every state but two. Some—
time he plans to spend a year go-
ing around the world.

Two years ago he published a
biography of Horace Mann, and he
is associate editor of the Educational
Forum. Through this magazine he
has met many wall-known authors.
thus adding to his magnificent col-
lection of autographed editions. As
well as these books he owns many
ancient manuscripts, dating from
the time of Ancient Egypt, Abraham,
and from the medieval period, Also,
he has original sheets from the St.
James version of the Bible.

in his travels about this country
he has taken many photographs of
historical and literary interest. With
some of these he hopes to illustrate
another book which will deal with
the lake country of Ohio, his native
state.

I. DOS
1. Do try to be earlier than the
instructor.

2. Put. your time for studying

on a budget-plan ttwenty-

four hours a day).

. Return library books on
time; save your money for
a coke.

4. Work hard, but get in your
fun. (Try the impossible).

.Do your own assignments;
sponges are for cleansing
purposes.

6. Study one hour when awake

rather than two when asleep.

7. Put your professor’s lectures
through a sieve; what comes
thru will be all you need.

.Keep your chin up; you’re

likely to step on it.

Keep up your correspon-

dence even tho your term

papers suffer.

10. Cut those heavy arguments;
there‘s enuf hot air this sum-
mer anyway.

II. DONT'S

1. Don‘t clutter up your mind

to

C)"

5000

To Do Or Not To Do

with non-essentials; the es-
sentials will clutter it up
enough.

2. Don’t. let; the heat; get you

down, even if the work does.

3. Don't forget that the instruc-

tor occasionally takes the

roll.

Don't think that crabbing

avails anything; crabs usually
land in hot water.

5. Don’t intersperse neighborly

comments with the lecture

of the instructor; only a few
of them pause for breath.

Don't copy your neighbor's

notes; your own may be

better.

. Don‘t forget that talking too
much is as bad as talking
too little; give the instruc—
tor a chance.

. Don't forget that having test
answers correspond with your
neighbor's arouses suspicion;
besides, it‘s adolescent.

. Don't yawn audiny in class;

State College Pushball Contest
Represented in World’s Fair

by Frances Murphy

and Frances Field

 

Have you been to the World's
Fair? Well, don‘t miss it.

Here are a few pointers from
two sightseers who have already
gone exploring there. Arm yourself

ith a map of the grounds. Take a
little or a lot of money as you like.
Carry your lunch if you wish, but
it’s a nuisance, f0r it’s much more
fun to eat at a sandwich or hot-dog
stand or in a foreign restaurant.
It will be a big task to see the
entire Fair, but no one need stay
away on that account, for it is
easy to get to, to look at, to get
around in. and. yes, it is even
conveniently comfortable.

You will want to begin the day
by having a look at the future city
inside the Perisphere; it will help
you to understand the motif of all
that awaits you on the grounds.
And the Heliclinc! What a sweep—
ing panoramic view it affords as it
curves downward from the Perl—
sphere exit! Such bright colors
and strange shapes! Such huge
statues and multi-colored buildings.
Such inviting gardens and cooling
fountains! There is no observation
window in the sky—piercing Trylon.
so don‘t ask to go up.

Take a stroll from the Theme
Center through Constitution Mall
to the distant Federal Building; it
will give a comprehensive close—up
of the heart of the Fair. Then to
save the feet and conserve time.
take a sightseeing train from one
point to another around the grounds.

You will be interested to note that
State College is represented in the
New York State building by a
picture of the annual freshman-

 

in the form of travel books, school
books, best sellers and reproduc-
tions of portraits and historic docu—
ments. awaits you in each of the
foreign buildings. Some of the
articles are merely the regulation
tourist souvenirs, but if you choose
wisely. your time and money will
be well spent.

If you are interested in the prob—
lems of Europe — and who isn't.
right now——bc sure to visit the
Czechoslovakian exhibit. It is the
tomb of liberty and is supported
by the friends of that country in
America. This particular exhibit
was nearing completion when Hitler
made. one of his thrusts, and Czecho—
slovakia as an independent nation
was no more. A hush falls and
voices barely whisper as each new
group surges into the building,

in the amusement area, don’t
miss Billy Rose‘s Aquucadc. It's a
beautiful spectacle with seventy—two
swimmers performing in intricate
designs. See it at night if possible.

There's it good day’s Fairgoing
for one in this program and you will
have seen a vision that will keep
you Wondering for a long while.
BUT by all means, prolong your
visit until after dark, for at night
the vast panorama of the Fair be-
comes a sea of multi—colored light,
and elaborately patterned pyrotech-
nic displays as the Lagoon of Nations
fills the night hours with brilliance.

Statementor

 

W. B.

The time has come. the walrus
said, to speak of many things—-
but he didn't. have the things to
talk about that we have today. He
couldn’t talk of 8:10 classes that
strange people were anxious to get;
to. They have a reason though.
it's much cooler in the morning
than it is later in the day.' He
didn't know about the cool spots
beneath the trees out. on the cam-
pus, or about those miserably sticky
seats in the afternoon classes at
State during the summer. In the
time of the walrus there were none
of the hot-alr-conditioned lecture
rooms that we have here at State,
so he couldn't have Spoken of them.

The poor walrus had never heard
of these famous men of education
whose names are borne by our
various halls. He wouldn't have
known Andrew S. Draper, whose
work as Commissioner of Educa-
tion was essential in setting up the
system of public high schools we
have today. He hadn’t heard of
Page, or Hawley, or Richardson, or
any of the rest, so naturally he
couldn't have talked of them.

Probably he‘d never even heard
of Albert Huested and the State
men he took with him to the Civil
War. Perhaps you‘ve never noticed
the plaque on the wall of Huested
Hall. as you enter from the peri-
ster on the Draper side.

Most amazing of all to Carroll's
little pet might be the Annex when
twelve o‘clock has gonged and our
football players might well seek
protection.

He might even be a bit amazed
to see some of our teachers of high
school safety courses parking their
cars around school. Their boards
of education might give them as
much of a surprise as the Walrus
might get from watching them.

Woe betide the student teacher
who follows the example of our
instructors. Imagine yourself squat-
ting on the desk or gazing out the
window when you did your practice
teaching.

Then too he might; wonder if
they aren't human but it seems as
if some of the profs might take off
those coats during their lectures.
Everyone would feel much more
comfortable, including themselves.
