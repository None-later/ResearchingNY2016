SUMMER SCHOOL NEWS, JULY 23, 1939

 

 

Random

Remarks

 

 

 

In decided refutation of the arti-
cle in last Sunday’s Times, labelling
college summer schools as country
clubs, is State College? And, in this
column, we'll endeavor to prove that
we aren’t enrolled in a concentration
camp either.

The men at school are making
fashion news this summer. Green
and sky blue gabardine seem to be
very fashionable. Even members of
the faculty prove susceptible to this
trend. If colorful personalities
emerge as a result, we‘ll give the
fashion a rating of four stars.

Occasionally events occur to break
the monotony of study in the Com-
mons. A serious looking principal
was much amused when a co-ed ap-
proached him and asked if she might
borrow his pipe. We understand
that some of the girls in the dorm
come prepared - and pouch their
own tobacco.

There are three tall, dark brothers
in summer session. Aside from hav-
ing all this in common, they are
good at shagging. Did you spot
them at Statezapoppin?

Miss Morton, Supervisor of Hous-
ing, and head resident at the dorm,
is good at remembering names. She
knowa the names of everyone but
a dozen or so. Miss Morton must
have that'invaluable habit of recog-
nizing names instead of faces.

Chi Sig broke up the summer

school doldrums by journeying to
Thacher Park, Sunday, for a steak
roast. The Delta Omega girls have
carried the idea further by having
a hot dog roast every Saturday night
in their own backyard.
 Steal into the auditorium some
day and slip into a seat. You may
be charmed into forgetting that
term paper by hearing Tom Garrett
at the piano. The man can play.

We’ll dispense with the customary
phrases with which columnists us-
ually conclude, and add—we hope
that this isn’t a column to end all
columns.

Superiority of Women
Gaming in Popularity

The much-discussed but ever-
popuiar controversy regarding man’s
superiority over woman was revived
in the midst of a bull session at
Spencer Hall. Many sensible argu-
ments were put forth in favor of
each over the other, but the weight
of evidence seemed to favor man's
being superior to woman.

“Women who spur men on, are
greater than men who achieve" be-
causa back of the success of all (or
most) great personalities has been
the guiding and inspirational hand
of a woman—be it a mother, sister.
wife, or sweetheart. Nothing is so
great and forceful or penetrating as
"inspiration" to aid in lifting a man
from oblivion and obscurity into
sudden prominence.

It is the woman that really de-
serves the credit while in reality the
man, selfish as man is. gives to the
world the impression that HE has
succeeded. that HE has achieved,
that HE has reached the pinnacle
of success through the “sweat of his
brow."

Let us not be disillusioned—let us
give credit where credit is due.

by Jean De Fort

A survey reveals the fact that it
costs the average non—working stu-
dent 3115 for the privilege of at-
tending a summer session at New
York State College for Teachers.
Room and board requires forty-eight
dollars with an extra ten dollars for
noon lunches. Books take varying
amounts from four to fifteen dollars.

Most of the people at summer
session have two definite intentions:
economy and serious study. Movies
and sports, of course, claim the time
and interest of many, but the girls
seem to plan a very small amount
for this item, depending, it seems,
on the boys to see that they get
their necessary recreation. This is
especially interesting in light of the
fact that men average a lower ex-
pense than women, considering
only those who do not work.

It is also interesting to note that
the room and board average is con-
siderably lowered by the great num-
ber of girls who cook their own
meals.

It is difficult to state an average
total cost or an average for any
particular item because of widely
varying styles of living. We have
the plutocrats. on one hand, who
pay sixty dollars or even more for
room and board, gallivant around
in cars, and insist that summer
school costs at least $200.

On the other hand there are
many who work for their room
and board in private homes and
many who do part-time work in
the Library, Cafeteria, Annex and
wait on table at the various group
houses. Two of those interviewed
figured on “just about breaking
even." Some augment their re-
sources by taking kidding jobs
(taking care of kids. to youl). A
unique way of vacation living plus
educational advancement plus econ-
omy equals the method practiced
by at least two couples who are

 

Garrett Plays Piano
At Noon In Page Hall

Do You like music? Do you
like modern swing or the old
fashioned classics? Are you in-
terested in listening to an ex-
cellent pianist who is well-versed
in both modern swing and the
classics? Tom Garrett plays every
noon in the auditorium of Page
hall—he plays to an empty house
just to amuse himself. Why not
get together and spend a few
minutes in the auditorium noons?
Keep up on the music of the
day as it is played by Garrett.

State college summer session.

For a dash of faculty to add to
this hearty meal of figures, I quote
a professor (name withheld) on this
subject. “Last year I managed to
spend a little more than I earned."
So you see the faculty is beset with
ﬁnancial worries even as the most
inexperienced undergraduate.
Transportation is strictly an in-
dividual item, and no average could
be computed because of the Widely
differing regions from which people
come. Another cause of variance
is the use of cars. Those who have
cars here spend an extra ten to
thirty dollars to keep them going,
depending on the extent of week-
end trips.

Most summer students come well-
stocked with clothes and incidentais.
Some, however, plan to buy in Al-
bany, and most of the girls can’t
tear themselves away without at
least one new dress.

The frequency (a nice, educa-
tional word) of going home for the
weekend is entirely unpredictable.
Distance has little to do with it.
Many drive or ride long distances
to be at home every weekend, while
many others go home but once or
perhaps not at all during the ses-
sion.

The summer students are sup-
porting the government admirably
in at least one department. Stamps
and stationery comprise a consid-
erable proportion of the amount
spent for incidentais. Girls are far
ahead of the boys in this respect,
writing approximately eight letters
a week, while the boys let it go
at one or two. One boy said he
might manage three during the six
weeks. Wonder Who's the lucky girl
getting half a letter a week.

Problem of Lunches
Perplexes Students

Mid-Day Classes are Cause
Of Hunger Frustration

The lack of any definite lunch
hour in the summer session schedule
of classes. has resulted in a peculiar
state of affairs for some students
here. A goodly percentage find that
they have barely the ten minutes
between classes in which to grab a
snack between 11:00 and 1:00 o'clock.
Others are stabbed with hunger
pains before the 12:30 bell releases
them. This situation has caused a
lively debate among various groups.
One insists that “brunch” is the
best method because it saves money
by providing one combination meal
at about 11:00 a. m. instead of both
breakfast and lunch.

The other school of thought con—
sists of that great army of sufferers
belonging to the 11:00-12:30 classes.
Consider the problem of these poor
people. We hurriedly gulp a thim—
bleful of tomato juice and a cup of
coffee at 7:30 and dash to an 8:10
lecture. At 10:30 we are beginning
to get sleepy, but certainly not
hungry. Eleven o’clock comes with
no desire to eat yet. And so to
class. 11:30 arrives and still the
pangs of hunger are not stirring.
But wait, oh wait, till 11:45—then
12:00—oh, heaven, is this class ever
going to end? Will my stomach
ever be the same again? At last——
at long last—the hands of the clock
creep to 12:30 and we rush to the
Annex. Ah yes, and what do we
find? A line a mile long (more or
less), moving forward at an infini-
tesimal pace toward that Promised
Land of beautiful sandwiches and
wholesome, thirst-quenching drinks.
We finally stagger to the counter,
weak and dazed, convinced that on
the morrow we shall join the con-

 

; verts to the two-breakfast method:

one at 10:30 and another at 12:30.
So now We eat twice when we're not
hungry in order to avoid being too
hungry when We eat once. If that’s
not a paradox, I'll eat my books.

Attendance Reports

Show Few Absences

lllncs's Takes Small 'l‘oll
At State Summer Session

The heat wave experienced last
week brought the thermometer to a
high of 95 degrees, but summer
school students merely took off their
coats and attended classes as faith-
fully as they did the first day.

Reports from the summer session
office indicate that of the 1381 stu-
dents in attendance only 21 have
been reported as being absent two or
more times. Week-end casualties
are at a minimum with no signifi-
cant number of absences on Mon-
days, according to Dr. Ralph Beaver
in charge of summer school atten-
dance. This record holds in spite
of the number who attend the
World's Fair for week—end recre-
ation.

The records show that excuses
range from illnesses caused by vac-
ciilatioil to serious cases of sunburn.
One person was excused to appear
in court for a traffic violation.

"My experience has been that at-
tendance at summer school is always
very good," commented Dr. Beaver.
He indicated that most 01‘ the legi-
Limutc absences were caused by per-
sonal illness or by illness or death
in the family.

No one has been dropped as yet
for irregular attendance. "Once in
:1 while a car will break down,” was
the film] admission of Dr. Beaver
in adding one more excuse to the
list.

Dr. Harold Thompson
Writes Book on N. Y

Professor at State Presents
“Body, Boots and Britches”

State College faculty and students,
those interested in folk-lore, and all
citizens of New York State will be
happy to hear that Dr. Harold W.
Thompson's book on the folk-lore
of our state will be published in
October.

“Body, Boots and Britches," an
appropriate title for such a rich,
heady book, means in substance that
a great variety of material has been
included. New York is in reality
a great rural state. and its culture
has been contributed to by a melting
pot of nationalities. French-Cana—
dian. Irish, Dutch, Italian—ail of
these peoples have given color to our
history.

Enriched by students’ contribu-
tions, this book. told in delightful
anecdotal style, will make familiar
to all the lore of New York State.

State College, proud to have the
author of so distinguished a book as
a member of its faculty, is eagerly
awaiting the date when .1. B. Lip-
pincott and Co., will publish “Body,
Boots and Britches."

An earlier book by Dr. Thompson,
"Henry MacKenzic, a Man of Feel-
ing," is widely regarded by compe-
tent critics as one of the most acute
interpretations of Scottish literary
society and literary fashions in the
late eighteenth and early nineteenth
centuries.

Dr. Thompson is one 01‘ two men
in this country who have been
granted the degree of 1). Lift. from
Edinburgh University.

which Thomas Ryan became the

Tonight for the second time this
summer, the Commons of Hawley
Hall will be the scene of a gay turn-
out of faculty members and students.
At 8:30 o’clock the doors will be
opened to all students of the sum-
mer session here at the college, as
Well as to faculty members and
guests. Admission is twenty-five
cents per person, payable at the
door.

Decorations

The theme of the decorations will
be a summer garden, but the full
plans of the committee have not
been disclosed. Guests are fore-
warned, however, that the decora-
tions will be suggestive rather than
realistic, so that no one may be kept
away because of hay fever.

Music for dancing will be supplied
by means of the college victrola and
loud speaker system. Recordings of
the orchestras of Artie Shaw, Count
Basie, Jan Savitt, Glen Miller, and
others, are on the program for the
evening. The larger part of the
floor of the Commons will be kept
clear for the dancers. The commit-
tee promises that all “jitterbugs”
will be confined to one corner of the
room, so that the more conservative
can move around in comparative
safety.

Besides music, the News staff,
whose members are acting as hosts,
have provided tables and cards for
those who wish to use them. Try to
arrange a bridge game before you
come, or else see what you can do
when you got here tonight.
