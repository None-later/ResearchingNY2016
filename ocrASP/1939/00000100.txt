Food for Thought

Culture in State College is a non-entity. The
fault, dear students, is not with the administration
but with ourselves who are too engrossed in accumu-
lating credits and earning degrees to take active re-
cognition of this lack.

A college is supposed to be a “seat of learning,”
“a society of friends of learning.” How can a person
be learned who has so narrowed his interests that he
has little or no first-hand knowledge of the accom-
plishments of outstanding people in all fields of
endeavor? College should be the place where stu-
dents have the opportunity to seek out and under-
stand what is going on in the whole country—-—a
place where he has the chance to develop his imag-
ination—a place where the individual is not sacri-
ficed to the curriculum but rather developed by it.

Every year for six weeks during the summer, at
least 1300 school administrators and teachers attend
State College in the city of Albany. Neither college
nor city offers them very much by way of cultural
development, except the movies——double-headers,
at thatll

in view of this situation, State has the oppor-
tunity of becoming the capital district’s cultural
center. if each registrant were to pa a student tax
of one dollar or one-fifty, if definite plans were
made well in advance by a responsible committee,
it would be perfectly possible to bring to the college,
for the enjoyment of students and townspeople,
eminent non-academic speakers and outstanding
musical and dramatic groups: Skinner, Frost, liroun,
Millay, Boston Symphony, etc.

if there were no financial and professional lim-
itations, many students who come here for advanced
work would select colleges and universities where
facilities for cultural growth are an acknowledged
feature of the program. Surely with a little con-
certed action, N. Y. S. C. '1‘. also could awaken
culturally.

'l‘he SUMMaa Scnooi. News would like to be
an instigator oi the movement toward the estab-
lishment of a program of cultural activities. We
shall welcome all expressions of personal minion
from the entire summer session clientele. ct us
know if you would like such a program. There is
a NEWS mail box in the basement of Draper. Tell
us if you think the plan is practical and worth-
while or chimericai. If We are to have such a pro-
gram next year arrangements should begin at once.

 

 

[Believe - Do You?

 

 

 

I believe in the education of the mind to its fullest
capacity, but more than that, I believe more firmly in
the educated heart—that “mystic organ whence flows"
that certain undefinable quality called human kind-
ness.

There are many who are masters of the classics.
There are countless “wizards of Oz." They come
wholesale. But the people who impress me are the
certain few who can ask so charmingly for the salt
to be passed that it becomes an art. (You can't help
but pins the pepper, too).

The educated person knows that "excuse me” is the
correct expression—and not “beg pardon;” but it’s the
educated heart who is never late for an appointment.
Being late would mean bringing that much less of
himself.

In looking at a group picture, whom do you look
at first? Yourself! But the educated heart looks out
from his narrow sphere, “beyond the horizon.” No
racial or religious barriers exist for him. In his heart
there is always a valve left wide-open.

I believe that most people are willing to give a
beggar a few coins. But it is the educated heart who
will give the miserable creature a few cents worth of
himself—a smile, a word of encouragement.

I belieVe with all My heart that an educated heart
is more important than a cultivated mind. Strangely
enough it is of easy access; it seems too bad that so
few take advantage of it.

Communications

 

 

Dear Editor:

I enjoy reading the Credos of education expressed
by various student and faculty members weekly in the
News. The more I read. the more I wonder. Is the
philosophy expressed in them the response of a teacher
who has actually arrived thereat through the media
of Joys and experiences personally felt in teaching?
Or is it the partly-masticated, half-digested remnants
of college courses and elementary textbook study of
psychology? So many of them seem platitudinous and
pedestrian, products of overdrawn theories and under-
done practicalities. that I feel more often than not
that the Credo is simply the effort of an individual to
clarify and formulate the mass of theoretical aims
and ideals in education accumulated through mass
education. In short. I find it fairly difficult to see
the forest for the trees.

Curtain!

Charles Coburn, managing director of the Mohawk
Drama festival, this week departed from his usual
policy of producing only plays of established value by
presenting the world premiere of Charlotte Cortlay.
the tragic story of the woman who assassinated Murat,
a leader of the French Revolution.

Charlotte Corday is the dramatic story of a woman
who because of her loyalty to France, devotion to
liberty. and sympathy for those suffering under the
Reign of Terror dared to kill the than most respon-
Hible for the mass executions and wanton destruction.
The play begins with Charlotte's conception of the
idea to kill Marat, reaches its climax when she stabs
Marat in his bath. and ends with a touching scene in
her subsequent trial for treason.

Miss Eugenie Leontovich. the star. because of her
emotional range. and mtturulness successfully por-
trayed the part of tho girl-martyr. Most of the reality
of the story was duo to Miss Leontovich’s ability to
submerge her own personality into that of a woman
who lived a hundred and fifty years ago.

Miss Jerome. the author. does not attempt. to vie
with historians. She does not interpret the history
of the French Revolution. The original quality of the
story is in its firm and unluflated characterization.

The setting and the colorful costumes of the period
combined with the natural background of the campus
to bring us back to the atmosphere of the eighteenth

 

 

century.

High lights

on the

High brows

 

 

It seems the highbrows are slip-
ping, or else we are. We just can’t
seem to learn any secrets about some
of them. Maybe it's due to their
natural t?) reticence, or their sense
of self-preservation. But anyway,
it‘s hard on perspiring column-
ists . .
We like the story about Dr. C. C.
Smith's interview with a prospective
freshman. As you know, the inter-
viewers must rate the personality
traits of the individual. Dr. Smith's
terse but graphic remark concerning
one charming applicant’s person-
ality was simply, “She can have
my last nickel." And some think the
professors aren‘t human . . . .

Did you know that professors gen-
erally don't like competition, in class
or out? Dr. Bruce is offering a re-
ward to the one or several who can
quiet the little ones who play behind
the library daily from 11 to 12.
Surely, a government instructor
should know that it‘s a free country
where everyone has a voice . . . .

We hear that Dr. Stewart Brown
likes to be interviewed. He even
agrees to illustrate the interviews
with anecdotes. Someone told us
not to try to discover the truth of
the assertion because the anecdotes
are not exactly the type for publi-
cation . . . .

If anyone is interested in a Junior
high school set—up for extra-class
activities, go see Dr. Drake. But
be sure you have plenty of time and
an extra amount of energy, for it's
a man-sized task to comprehend it.
From what we’ve heard, it's duck
soup for the professor, and jellied
consomme for the average indivi-
dual . . . .

Dr. Anderson's classes inform us
that his humor is devastating. and
his comments on literature even
more so. His opinion on Chaucer
as the father of Medieval literature.
and on fathers in general. is pretty
good. Ask him about it . . . .

We think we'd like Dr. Osborne's
classes. Isn‘t he the one who gives
a i'iVo minute recess every day dur-
ing his hour and a half classes?
We wish We had instructors like
that, Oh, Well, we heard that Mr.
Osborne is more or less of a. Boy
Scout with the "Be Prepared” motto
prevalent. Maybe this other is Just
his good deed for the day . . . .

Dr. Powor thinks the Summer
School News is a very important
addition to the summer session. He
says that he thinks it's necessary to
know all that‘s going on around
here, and before the arrival of the
paper, he missed out on many activi—
ties. We really can't imagine Mr.
Power's not keeping abreast of the
times. He seems to be walking
through tho halls a good deal, and
not with his eyes closed, either . . . .

We hope your eyes aren't closed
after reading this. At least keep
thorn open for the good time tonight
at our party. where you can meet.
your friends among the students
and the faculty we hope). After
the barrage of mid-semester quizzes
the faculty should be in a receptive
mood . . , .

 

So we’ll be seeing you. Won't we?

Winners

F .P.A.
The Meal Ticket

Brains plus a screwball has yank-
ed the injury—riddled New York
Giants out of a prolonged slump.
A paradox? Not quite.

A little over two weeks ago the
Giants were making a bid for the
leadership of the National League
when suddenly a combination of
player-umpire quarrels and injuries
knocked the props from under the
team. A fierce tailspin began, and
New York fell from second to fifth
place. Manager Bill Terry tried
nearly every conceivable method to
Win games. New blood was instilled
into the line-up by the recall of Tom
Hafey and by the acquisition 01
Frank Scalzi. But it was no go.

In one final desperate gesture, the
manager called upon an old timer,
a gentleman who was the Giants’
meal ticket during 1936 and 193'].
Carl Hubbel, using his brains as
well as his famous screwball, came
through with the Terrymen’s first
victory in ten starts.

Many looked upon the victory as a
lucky one for the pitcher. A wee
later Hub came through again.

The New Yorkers are still far
away from their winning form, but
if King Carl can reign supreme once
again, that race may get tighter
down the home stretch.

A New Champion

Hammering Henry Armstrong's
days as a lightwolght ruler are
numbered. In fact he has seventeen
days left in which to wear his crown.
After that. it will be his no more.

Lou Amber's, the Herkimer flush,
will be the new lightweight. king
come 11:30 o'clock of August 22. To
many this may seem a foolish prog-
nostication, a bit of wishful think—
ing, but that is the way the bout
will end. Lou came close to beat—
ing Armstrong last year. Many
thought he did. The decision went
to the colored lad but so did the
beating.

Amber's is the type of fighter who
meets a man once, may lose to him,
but in the second encounter the
procedure is reversed. His cool head.
his great boxing ability. and his
keen competitive spirit will offset
the whirlwind tactics of the current
lightwoight titleholder.

The Davis (.‘up

Will the United States win the
Davis Cup matches this your? Alice
Marble, Wimbledon champion, feels
that our lads are good enough to
come through. She is highly opti-
mistic, however. and certainly she
has no Justification for being so.

The Seabrlght, New Jersey tennis
tournament provided so many up-
Hots among the top ranking Amer—
ican tennis players that our chances
of retaining lho eup are slim indeed.

SUMMER SCHOOL NEW, AUGUST 4, 1939

i “Bill” Hardy Brings Experience

To State Collfge Broadcasting

 

To the strains of “College of the
Empire State," NYSCT goes on the
air thru the facilities of WOKO.
every Thursday afternoon during
regular session for a half hour be-
ginning at 4:15 o'clock.

Radio broadcasting is a new and
inspiring enterprise for the college.
Its possibilities for faculty members
and students are unlimited. It was
inaugurated last March with the
enthusiastic approval of President
Brubacher and under the leader-
ship of Mr. Hardy who has had pro-
fessional experience in this kind of
work.

A committee of seven professors
representing various departments of
the college plan programs designed
to reveal the character of work and
variety of interests carried on by
the college.

Appropriately enough the first
broadcast this spring was a drama-
tization of the history of the col-
lege, written and performed by Eng—
lish majors, under the direction of

V

Mr. Jones. The rest of the series
included a part of the MIKADO. a
Milne High extra-curricular activ-
ity program, round-table discussions
arranged by the science and the so-
cial studies departments, N. Y. folk-
lore program by Dr. Thompson’s
class, dramatization of ALICE IN
WONDERLAND, an original play
called DRUM ISLAND by Gweneira
Williams, ’38, and a concert by the
choral society.

Broadcasting is done from Draper
207 which has been made as nearly
soundproof as possible and to which
each week an engineer of WOKO
brings the necessary apparatus.
Announcer Hardy is interested in
receiving any ideas for use of State
College extra-curricular activities
on his programs for next year. Va-
riety and interest are the key-note
of all plans for this progressive pro-
ject. Tune in if you are near
WOKO’s range and let your sugges-
tions be known to those who are
laboring to make this undertaking
a real success.

 

 Beta Ball Team
Defeats Oneonta Alumni

Men students at Kappa Beta de-
feated the Oneonta Alumni softball
team with a score of 7-6, in a hard
fought contest on the Alumni Resi-
dence field on Wednesday afternoon,
July 26th.

Victory was uncertain until the
last of the ninth inning when Don
Moore drove in the Winning tally.

The teams shared batting honors
on distance drives with Phil Davies
of Kappa Beta and Guy Shaw of
Oneonta poling long homers into
right. field. Batteries for the game
were Kappa Beta: Ted Archer and
Jerry Caswell; Oneonta: Sam Mor-
gantl and Bartholdi.

This is the second in a series of
baseball games played betWeen the
two teams.

A game was scheduled for Mon-
day afternoon but because of rain
was postponed.

 

Faculty Slugs Frolic
At Red-Letter Picnic

The male members of the Sum—
mor school facility held their
annual stag picnic yesterday at
Saratoga. On the program for
the day, besides supper, was a
softball game between the faculty
of the regular session at. State
College and the visiting faculty.

The point to note is this: Dr.
Arthur A. Smith. visiting profes—
sor of economics from Texas. was
barred from the pitcher's box
because he had earlier proved
himself to beﬂof all thingsi—too
good for the rest of the bunch!

Mystery Door Barred

At Commons Entrance

We have a mystery here at
State! See if you can solve it.
We can‘t. Here are the details.

We like the library a lot. It
has nice tables and everything.
But sometimes it gets a bit over-
crowded and then We seek a spot
which provides more elbow room.
chart-making, etc. So we go to
the Commons.

But. what we really should say
is, We take a Jaunt there. It
seems too bad that we must go
to the library first, then down a
couple flights of stairs, and fin-
ally nrrive panting in the Com-
mons.

It seems too bad. too. that. that
door in lower Draper which opens
very conveniently into the Com-
mons is barred.

Now, why is it? If there is a
good legitimate excuse, we shall
go about our work and try our
best to overlook it.

Dr. F. M. Vreeland

A teacher who can make an eight
o'clock class on a hot July morning
interesting is certainly worth know-
ing. Such a teacher is Dr. F. M.
Vreeland who enlivens his sociology
classes with incidents from his wide
experience in sociological fields.
After graduating from Alma Col-
lege, Michigan, Dr. Vreeland studied
at the New York School of Social
Work, subsequent to which he did
considerable work in connection with
the settlements and family welfare
groups in New York City and New
Jersey. In order to study under
Elsworth Huntington and other
noted sociologists, Dr. Vreeland did
additional study at Yale. From there
Dr. Vreeland went to Miami Uni—
versity as Professor of sociology. He
also taught three years at the Uni-
versity of Michigan, from which he
received his Ph. D. degree in 1929.
Since that time he has been teach-
ing at Depauw University. Green-
castle, Indiana.

Dr. Vreeland has shown his in-
terest in sociological problems in
other ways than teaching. He work-
ed with the National Research Pro-
ject of the W. P. A. in 1936 in mak-
ing surveys of unemployment. In
1937 he acted as president of the
State Conference of Social Work.

Dr. Vreeland, in spite of this work,
has found time to develop his hobby
of Indian archeology. His other
hobbies are amateur photography
and quolts.

Dr. Vreeland says. “This is my
third year at State College. I en-
joy it very much because of the
maturity of the students who show
such a spontaneous interest in social
subjects,”
