We’ve heard of “drop the hand-
kerchief" but never “drop the vege-
table." Jane Wilson was the lucky
recipient of a supply of radishes
and cucumbers found outside her
door at the dorm.

Still at the dorm—we hear there‘s
a new night watchman up there.
Could there be any relation between
the afore-mentioned vc ;etables and
“Sheriff” Monahan's departure?
Incidentally, the new watchman was
formerly connected with the culinary
department of the dorm.

Judging by the way many pros—
pective freshmen are roaming the
halls. the class of ’43 will tend to be
somewhat independent in its way of
dress. Many of the frosh come all
dressed up while others seem to be
somewhat lackadaisical about the
whole thing.

We were overwhelmed to find that
the average State College Summer
School student allows but one hour
a day for recreation. How amusing
to find one’s self on a mental par
with the Kalikaks. It was also
gratifying to realize that an under-
graduate is studying for her mas-
ter’s. What dreadful blunderers
these little newspapers are.

Moreland Hall inaugurated its own
"formal" social season this summer
with a "vie" party last Friday eve-

and from the city enjoyed dancing.
cards. and an old-fashioned “gab-
fest" spiced with the wit of the par-
ticipants.

The life of the party was Dr. St.
John who made it clear by word and
action that he was not acting in the
capacity of chaperon. He claimed
a girl for every dance and enter-
tained between numbers with Jokes.
stories and songs.

The “Beer Barrel Polka" vied
with “Little Audrey” for the atten-
tion of the group. Of the various
styles of dancing exhibited during
the evening the outstanding feature
was an impromptu jitterbug inim-
ber performed by Betty Dodge and
Rudy Egnaczyk.

General Chairman of the affair
was Miss Louise Carstens of Brook-

Kleptomam'a Strikes

State Summer School

According to the psychologists.
one of the cardinal instincts of
people is to collect and possess.
As evidence of this instinct, a
student is already minus a new
Elgin watch which he left lying
on a desk in R-202; the libraries
are minus a few of their treasured
books and magazines; an English
professor is minus a Webster's
Intercollegiate dictionary, mys-
teriously missing from his office;
the laboratory is minus part of
its mechanical equipment and
materials. including some hair-
dye compounded by some.neo~
phytes in chemistry; certain of
the students are minus umbrellas
left hanging in unguarded places.
Could this kleptomaniacai ten—
dency be curbed for the remain-
dcr of the session?

Supervisors and Principals
Debate Censorship of
Fiction at Tea

An open forum on the question of
censorship of adult fiction for pub-
lic schools was held August 2, in the
Milne High School library.

Members of the panel consisted
of Mrs. Mac Parkinson Webb, Assis-
tant Professor of Librarianship. New
York State College for Teachers;
Miss Agnes C. Fecny, librarian,
Saratog'n Springs High School; Mr.
Harold P. Frcncii, District Superin-
tendent. Albany County; Mrs. John
Bellamy Taylor. former Board of
Education member. Schenectady;
Joseph Wells, New York State Col-
lege for Teachers, 1939; Miss Kath-
erine E. Wheeling. Assistant Pro-
fressor and Supervisor of English.
Milne High School, and John Witt-
hoi't. Albany High School. 1939.

Mrs. Webb, chairman, opened the
discussion by reading a letter written
by a parent to the State Education
Department in protest against sev-
eral passages in a recent book of
historical fiction which was uiadc
available to her child in the high
school library. In reply to this. Mrs.
Taylor said that it is a lack of faith
in their children's judgment based
upon home training, and a reluc-
tance to expose them to sordidncss.
that prompts sonic pounds to pro-
test at realistic fiction.

Mr. French brought out the idea
that cciisorship is a negative up»
pronch to the problems of the high
school library. “RU-l (lucaiion of par-
ents is much to be preferred." he
said.

Mrs. chb suggested that a pill"

As Session Closes

Next Tuesday and Wednesday
Are Reserved for Tests

 

 

This week comes the animal cram—
ming season. for on Tuesday and
Wednesday of next week State Col-
logo Summer Session students will
be taking final examinations.

The type and length of the ex-
amination are to be determined by
the instructor. The fact that a course
is a three-hour course does not nec-
essarily mean that the examination
will take three hours. This matter
is left for the instructor to decide.

The ordinary examination regu-
lations will be obeyed. No books or
papers may be taken into the exam—
ination room and all pocketbooks
should be left on the Di‘OCl.Ol"S desk.
All necessary paper will be furnish-
ed by the examiner.

There will be final examinations
in all courses. If there are any
make—ups for mid—term tests or
quizzes. they will be scheduled on or
before August 12. The full exam-
ination schedule will be found on the
fourth page of the News.
