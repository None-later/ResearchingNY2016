 

SUMMER SCHOOL NE,WS, AUGUST 11, 1939

 

Quips & Quizzes

 

“What's sauce for the goose is
sauce for the gander.” So spake
Henry Patrick on the eve of the
great battle of Run—Bull—Run. In
other words, if the professors can
mete out quizzes, so can we.

We herewith submit this examin-
ation to every professor in the
school. If you score ten out of ten
points, we consider it a total fail-
ure. So, professors, rate yourselves.

True—False

1. During this summer session I
have fully covered the material I
passed out to my classes in those
voluminous outlines (?) at the be-
ginning of the semester. (For
history professors only).

2. I have learned to associate
students’ names with students’ faCes,
so that by now I can say “Yes, Mr.
Jones?" instead of “Yes, Mr. M-m-
m?.”

3. When I laugh and chat very
gaily with the students in my office,
I really mean to be as encouraging
as I sound.

4. I have detested listening to the
bally-hoo of those students who try
to impress me with their intelligent
grasp of my subject, and have ear-
nestly tried to squelch them.

5. I have been discriminating
enough to ascertain whether the
sweet young things making several
trips into my sanctum sanctorum
were really sincere in their quest
for knowledge or were merely in-
dulging in that traditional colle-
giate pastime—apple-polishing.

6. I really felt that my subject
was so interesting that no short re-
cesses were necessary even in an
hour and a half period.

7. I examined every test paper
and every term paper with meticu-
lous attention to every detail.

8. I have nobly restrained myself
from indulging in the telling of any
joke which was more than two years
old, and I really was not disappoint-
ed at the feeble laughter accorded
the ones I told, by the class.

9. I fully intend to mark the final
test papers sympathetically and
thoroughly. keeping my attention
away from the more glamorous occu-
pation of packing for that great
vacation trip.

10. I have attended at least one
Statezapoppiu. directing all my en-
ergies toward making this summer
session an all—round profitable ex-
perience.

 

 

“Equinoctiul” Storm

Nears State Students

A survey of the attitudes which
have prevailed at State this past
week reveals rumblings of the
approaching tempest, via—«the
examination period.

1. "If I can just live through
this week."

2. "Believe me, I’ve got to work
now."

3. “They're bearing down too
hard."

4. “Term papers during sum-
mer session aren’t fair; they’ll
never read 'em anyway.”

5. “If I can just make a C in
that history. I'll be satisfied."

0. “I don't know if it‘s my
I. Q. or my background or the
course."

7. “I‘m leaving on the spot—~-
Wednesday noon."

Moreland Hall Parties
Feature Innovations

Punch-making, Jitterbugglng,
and Gab-tests Are Hits

Moreland Hall continued its so-
cial season with another “vic” party
last Saturday night. Heartily sanc-
tioning the editorial policy of the
News. the girls planned to augment
their social contacts beyond snatches
of idle conversation in the library.
The party also provided an excellent
opportunity to demonstrate dancing
steps so “arduously” practiced night
after night. Twenty-eight feet hop-
ped, slid and pounded to the rhy-
thm of “Three Little Fishies" and
“Sunrise Serenade." Uncrowned
champions for the evening were
Anthony Rusito and Miss Betty
Dodge who entertained with original
interpretations of the shag and the
radio hop.

Everyone indulged in “creative
social activity" through the medium
of making punch. Each person held
a spoon in one hand and a bottle in
the other. By alternating the pro-
cesses of pouring and tasting an
effective system was devised where-
by an excellent drink was produced.

Hostess for the evening was Miss
Betty Beecraft of Lowville.

Social activity is being carried on
during the closing days of the sum-
mer session mostly through informal
get-togethers featuring dancing.

A new type of “social” (for sum-
mer session at least) was inaugur-
ated Monday night at the instiga—
tion of Miss Louise Carstens.
Several members of the faculty were
invited for an evening of conversa-
tion. Iced tea and cookies Were
served during the discussion of
education. the New York World’s
hair and travel in the United State
and in India.

Guests were Dr. and Mrs, Gilbert,
Dr. Drinkwater, Dr. St. John, and
Miss Morton.
