Bulger to Explain
Bureau Revisions

Seniors and Grads to Meet
Thursday at 4:30 P. M.
In Richardson Hall

With a change in name to Student
Employment bureau, the State Col-
lege Appointment bureau will short-
ly undergo a revision in its or-
ganization. Paul Bulger. secretary
of the bureau, will explain the de-
tails of this revision to seniors and
graduate students at a meeting

afternoon at 4:30 o‘clock in room
20 of Richardson hall.

The increased work of the bureau
and the competition arising from;
other institutions also preparing
teachers has made this reorganiza—

which will be conducted Thursday. _

'RE—rﬁrru-zs CHAIRMAN

a

 

tion necessary. The clerical force
of the past. while efficient, hast
been inadequate for the work of the'
bureau. Forty-three colleges other
than State are yearly producing
hundreds of candidates for jobs in
the teaching profession.

Under the new plan, a fee will
be required of all students desiriTig
to register with the bureau. The
funds will be used for facilitating
the activities and the work of the
bureau with the result that closer
contacts can be made with hiring|
principals.

"The Student Eiiipioymcnt bu-
reau is the go-bctwccn for the stu-
dent and the hiring officer," said
Mr. Buigcr in an interview. “This
'rcorganization will make possible
greater efficiency in the work of the
bureau.“

Included in the plans is a rcvi—
sion of the interview system. Do-
,t.ails of this will be explained fully
lby Mr. Buigcr at Thursday's meet—
ing.

The Appointment bureau, which
.had its origin during the presidency
'of Dr. William J. Milne. has gradu-
ally expanded until it is now one of
the outstanding organizations in the
piacciiicnt field. Dr. John M.
Saylcs, acting president of the col-
lege, was largely responsible for its
‘ development.
