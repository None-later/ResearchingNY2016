 Will Direct
Employment Bureau

Part-Time Service and NYA
to uppiement Each Other

A new agency known as the Stu-
dent Part-Time Employment bu-
reau has been added to State col-
lege to supplement the work of
the NYA in seeming part-time
employment for students. The bu-
reau is under the direction of Ed-
gar Perretz, '40, while the NYA
is headed by Roswell Fairbank, .

Both agencies are located in the
outer section of the Dean of Stu-
dents’ offices where the applications
ot needy students will be received.
These applications must be filled
out carefully and leginy to insure
speedy assignment of positions in
order of acceptance.

The bureau’s plans include can-
vassing and advertising in capital
district newspapers in an effort to
secure more positions for deserving
students. Arrangements have been
made with the News wherc‘iy a
regular column will appear in its
lswes. In the future the bureau will
be referred to as the PTEB. Through
a diligent plan of action the bureau
hopes to favorably establish its aim
among employers so that they will
become accustomed to the services
rendered by the agencies.

A survey reveals that approxi-
mately 150 students are working
either full or part-time on NYA
jobs. Although the NYA payroll is
now completed, it is hoped that,
through the advent of the new bu-
reau, positions will be available
throughout the year.

At the Aquacocle,
Show-Hit of the New York World’s Fair,
Chesterfield has the call

You see more Chesterfield smokers
every place you go. That’s because
Chesterfield’s Right Combination of
the best home-grown and aromatic
Turkish tobaccos is the only combina-
tion that gives them a cigarette of real
mildness with a diﬂerent and better
taste and a more pleasing aroma.
