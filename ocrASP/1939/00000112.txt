Student Council to Have

‘Gripefcst’ in Assembly

Students! Have you any griev-
ances against your constitution?
Yes? Well, here’s your chance to
voice them.

Student council has announced
that a “Gripefest” will be con-
ducted in the assembly on Friday,
October #13, to giVe all students an
opportunity to express their crit-
icisms and to make suggestions
concerning the constitution.

This year Student council has
decided to rectify the wrongs of
the present constitution, recover-
ing several by-laws, which prev-
iously had been forgotten or lost.
After simplifying and consolidat-
ing all these, the council expects
to produce a master copy with
which all may become easily
acquainted.

college, will appear before this morn-
ing’s student assembly at 11:10 ii

made for the reception of English
speaking guests at the house. Stu-
‘dcnts interested in living at the
house are advised that a few va—
" ancies still exist.

The customary junior reception
to the freshmen has been especially
arranged in honor of Dr, John M.
lSayles, acting president of the col-
llege and Mrs. Sayles. The formal-
ities of the program. as scheduled
by Paul Grattan, ’41, general chair-
man, will begin at 8:00 o'clock to-
night in Page hall.

On account of the death of Dr.
A. R. Brubacher, president of the
college. the annual president's re-
ception to the incoming class was
cancelled. But, now, the junior
class has seen fit to incorporate the
central idea of that reception into
their own. Therefore, the receiving
line, usually found at the postponed
Iaffair, will precede all other cere-
mony.

Program in Auditorium

The line will be organized imme-
diately outside the entranCe from
Richardson hall into Page hall.
Beatrice Dower and James Chapel],
co-chairmen of junior guides, will
head the line and present the fresh-
‘men to Dr. Sayles and his wife.
Merrill Walrath, president of the
junior class, will also shake the
hand of each member of his sister
class.

When this formality has been
loompleted, Walrath will officially
greet the freshmen. Afterwards,

with a dance.

The Italian club plans to em-
‘phasize the study of Sicilian folk-
lore. Dr. Harold Thompson, pro-
fessor of English, will lecture on this
topic at the second meeting of the
year. Meeting dates have not yet
Ibeen set.

Offer Now Ar! Courses

The Art department is offering
two new courses this year——
Design 5 in the first semester,
Design 6 in the second. Students
who are interested in color and
design in relation to the stage
will want to take Design 5. No
special ability or talent in draw—
ing and painting is needed. The
significance of color, dark and
light, and line movement, both in
costumes and scenery will be
studied. This course is expected to
prove an excellent compliment

well. The freshmen seem to consti-

that is the impression conveyed by
