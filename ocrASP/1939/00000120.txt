East and west, north and south, college stu cuts in every
type oi institution have tal<en up the c, “Stamp Out
Syphilis — Enemy oi Youth". Young person have been for
years the victims oi a "mistaken moral cen orship" which
iorbade discussion oi this leading threat to yuth health. But
during the past two years college editors an students have
helped materially to blast this censorship rom its shaky
foundations. Every day more students as ior iacts and
honesty. _

Students have instigated educational camigns and have
arranged iree blood tests ior students. At exas, George
Washington, Kentucky, 'V. P. l., Brrr (Hell, Pttsburgh, Syra-
cuse — and a host oi other uniVersrtres and olleges -— stu-
dent campaigns have met with startlrrrg succses. Presidents
and deans are beginning to see therr way clar to place the
blood test in its rightiul place in rorrtrne examinations, and
are recognizing the need ior course. in sexl education and
marriage guidance.

 

Ten million persons in the United States’have or have
had syphilis . . . a million potential mothers have syph-
ilis . . . 100,000 deaths a year . . 60,000 congenital
syphilitics born annually . . . linli oi every year's
500,000 new case, are under ‘25 years oi age . . .

Students and iaculty alil<e looked at the above statistical
picture oi syphilis. Many saw their responsibilities as leaders
oi the iuture and as trainers oi those leaders oi the iuture.
Others asked, HBut is this a problem ior us —- ior college
students and iaculty?" Just this past January the U. 5. Pub—
lic Health Service and the American Social Hygiene Asso-
ciation answered that question. On the basis oi more than
78,000 blood tests, they reported, tl’rw rate ior college stu-
dents is approximately the same as ior rhe corresponding age
group in the general population. lri March, the students
Spoke. Out oi nearly a million and a hall students, in col-
leges all over the United States, 93 'l per cent answered
HyesH to the question: HDo you belrr  a blood test before
marriage should be required by law7

HThe control oi syphilis is a tasl< in. the whole people",
Surgeon General Parran says. Rich or poor, in college 0'
out, young people oi today are vitriiy and directly con-
cerned with the control oi syphilis, ll  pictures indicate

0 As a resut oi student interest, schools are adding to

their guidance worlr (above). Many are now including

blood tests in routine physical examinations (below), and
the movement is growing.

 

0 Voluntary blood tests have illustrated the simplicity and

available in student-conducted campaigns, students lined
up to tal<e advantage (lower).

 

 

 

 

O Syphilis is spread in marriage. Technically, such iniections are "iri-'
nocent”, but innocence is no protection from syphilis. Blood tests be-
lore marriage could prevent many a tragedy.

0 Treatment is long *- at a minimum 18 months ol injections -- but
ii it is begun in the earliest stages, cure is probable in more than 85

percent ol cases.
