WilfrediAllard; 'W'liile in Europe,

Witnesses r-Wa-rtime Preparations

* by  Young; . o

(This is the second part of a story
of the summer European travels of
Wilfred Allard, who was in Italy
when the recent crisis arose and
broke.)

At Cannes, he saw. the famous
Battle of Flowers; in Nice, he at-
tended an outdoor performance of
“Prometheus Chained" in the R0-
man Arena and witnessed the Fete
des Provinces Francaises.

His first journey to Italy was
a pleasant one. Genoa, Pisa of the
famed Leaning Tower. Naples, Cap-
ri, Pompeii and Rome were high-
spots of his Italian visit. During
his three day's stay in Rome, be
viewed an outdoor performance of
“Aida”, in the ruins of the Caracal-
la Baths, which was attended by

20,000 people. The Conte de Savoia, '

Italian liner, was leaving Naples
during his visit; three days later.
as he returned to France, he again
saw the ship, which had been call-
ed back to Italian waters by Mus-
solini.

When the crisis came, Allard was
in Florence, Italy, where very little
about the crisis was known. The
American consul told all Americans
to leave as quickly as possible, since
no one knew when Italy might join
the Germans in the hostilities.
From Florence he proceeded to
Nice, to Grenoble and back to
Paris, where he was located when
the war was declared.

The wartime Paris was very calm
and quiet. Public notices to the
civilian population gave informa-
tion about procedure in case of
an air raid; all mm was censored.
All skylights and headlights were
painted blue; all lights were a dim
blue; traffic signals were removed;

Stale Clubs Prepare
1939 Fall Program

Numerous clubs of the college are
now planning their social activities
for the coming year. Meetings and
revision committees have scheduled
such innovations as a complete
study of Italian folklore by the
Italian club and a trip to New York
city by the Classical club. Hikes
are featured by the other clubs, as
are discussions and constitutional
revisions.

The Italian club will conduct a
meeting on Tuesday evening at 8:00
o'clock in the Lounge of Richardson
hall. John Caramia, ’40, president,
announces that the program will
feature Dr. Harold W. Thompson,
professor of English, as guest
speaker on the subject of Italian
folklore. Dr. Thomas G. Bergin,
professor of romance languages,
will also attend the meeting.

The Classical club has a prospec-
tiVe year in view as they initiate

a trip to New York city in the near
future to see the classical exhibit
in the American Museum of Art.

Allard Sails on Conte De Savoia
After Hectic Dash Across Europe

by Sally Young

(This is the last part 0/ a story
of the summer European travels a!
Wilfred Allard, who 100.9 in Italy!
when the recent crisis arose and
broke.)

Most men had enlisted for the
war, and it was a common sight.
if one was lucky enough to get
a taxicab (three—fourths of which
have been requisitioncd), to find
a woman driver. Wives took over
their husbands’ businesses, or else
the stores closed.

The poilus. who were leaving for
the front, would celebrate the last
day of liberty in every way possible.
Mothers smiled bravely as they said
goodbye to their sons at the stu-
tion: when the trains pulled out]
of sight, they broke down complete-l
ly.

The American consul at Paris
lold all Americans to leave there,
and proceed directly to the port;
from which they were to soil for“
the United States. In Lisicux, a cityi
nr-ur lo lluvrc, it was found that thcl
Nor-mambo had not yet loft Ncwl

 

York. Allard was present during,
three air raid ulurms. Suddenly, in
the middle of the night, the siren
blow, awakening the guests, who
hurried to the shelter in the hotel
wine cellar, to remain there until
one long blast indicated the con-
clusion of the raid. Roconnoltoring
planes were observed, but no bombs
Wore dropped.

Finally, Allard returned to Paris
to try to make arrangements for
returning home. Purely by chance;
he obtained one of the last three'

, room lil

son, and made an uneventful cross-

tinnc'nmo: cram:  amt,

which was sailing from Genoa. This

 

was possible only because the com-
munications were broken between
the Parisian and German offices,
since the boat was already more
than filled to capacity.

Two hectic days of red tape in
Paris—the special permission of the
police commissioner to leavo France
——pcrmission from the Swiss lega-
tion to go through Switzerland to
reenter Italy—the checking of all
cables and telegrams by the chief
of police—and his troubles were
partly overi The Orient express
from Paris to Istamboul, going
through Milan and Genoa, brought
him to his ship. The Italian liner
officials at first refused to honor
his vouchers, but later gave him
an impromptu bunk.

Until 11:00 o'clock the night be-
fore the bout sailed, Allard was un-
certain of passage. At. noon, Sep-
tember if), he left on the Conic do
Humid, which stopped at Naples,
came through the Mediterranean

ing. save for the observation of
one submarine of unknown nutlon-
ality.

Allard arrived in New York on
September 23. He had spent o.
glorlOUs summer's travel in Europe,
but he was glad to be back on
American soil.

He said: "I hope the war is of
short duration. Europe has so much
to offer the American traveler,
You come back a better citizen for
having seen what is going on over

 

there." i

Campus Queen Crowning to Highlight
Activities of Nineteenth. Campus Day

 

Faculty Sock Race, Clash With Colgate, Circus
Feature Attractions In Former Campus Days

"Oh, please, dear Minervtgii‘

prays this harassed, headlined,
deadlined reporter, “an annex
sandwich for a leadl Do you
know who's Campus Queen?"

“No, no, no!"

"Have you heard about the
staggering stupendous soph
stunt?”

“No, no, no!"

A fine thing! Campus day
and no scoop] Speaking of Cam-
pus day, when did it originate?
Why? What was Campus day
like in the good old daze?

Reviews of the march of time:
Ahawlook at this—a big, bold
black headline in the November
7, 1921 issue of the News herald—
ing Campus day as a college tra—
dition because of its successful
innovation 0. year before. Fond
memories of a faculty sack race,
a basket lunch picnic, and seiner-
sault racing.

Then time goosestops on. In
1922 the first Campus Queen was
crowned with a coronet of aut-
umn leaves. In 1923 the pro-
gram took the form of a circus
in the gym with the class stunts
molded to fit the theme.

But Campus day in 1924 was
to make history, for on this day
the gallant gridiron warriors of
State fought—hang on to your
hats, boys, fought Colgate (frosh)
in a bruising, battling game.
Mudder pin a roze on 115. (Ed.
Note—the score was Colgate 33,
State 0. We wuz robbed. We
shoulda stayed in the library.)

For some reason fieldball re-
placed football, and the GAA
girls sold lollypops to the wildly-
chcering spectators in the grand-
stand. Maybe it was the field-
ball—or the lollypops—or the
GAA girls, but at any rate Camp-
us day became so popular and the
attendance so ovorwhelming that
in the years from 1928 to 1930
it was necessary to issue tickets
of admission to the coronation
and stunts.

In 1935 control of the activities
of Campus day passed from
Myskania to Student council.
But while the council is in
charge of arrangements, it is
Myskanla who jealously guards
the secret of the queen's iden-
tity, as well as that of her at-
tendants.

 

Myskania Announces

State College Maidens

Capture Bold Intruder

“Come on, girls, are we men or
mice?"

With that cry four girls
dove at an object in their
locker room, and one run away
screaming. When the dust of the
battle cleared, Ethel Halter-man,
'42, exhibited the prize—n wee-
wee mouse.

His orientation into State col-
lege came quickly. lie was imme-
diately presented to Dunn Nelson,
who, caught momentarily off
guard, greeted Mr. Mouse as u.
prospective freshman. He made
a favorable impression. howcvor,
for the Dean christened him
"Felix" and formally admitted
him to State. After taking his on-
truncc exams, he was ullowod to
run about the library tables
where much excitement was stir-
red up.

Next came a trip to the Dean
of Students’ office whero Mrs.
Casey bit high "0" and took to
the customary refuge. Mr. Hardy
received him in his usual cordial
manner and subtly suggested that
he be kept in a cage in the activi-
ties office. At present Mr. Mouse
may be found “at homo" in the
Cooper house.

Dr. Gaga rty, Offstage, Explains
Ireland ’3 Attitude Toward War

by William Dorranoc

Speaking in a rapid Irish broguc,
Dr. Oliver St. John Gogarty drop-
pod some of the gems for which he
is famous to u Nuwn reporter in
u hurried back-stage interview.
Before stopping to the stage of
Page hall, he commented upon the
war, Irish literature, and the United
States.

To a question on Ireland’s posi-
lion in the present world catas-
lrophc, Liogurty stifled, “lrolund
has now 42,000 soldiers in the Brit-
iah urmy, waiting to embark to the
front in France. Of course this
enlistment is unofficial."

To the reporter's interruption,
hinting that Ireland is pro~British,
Gogarty replied, "No, I wouldn't
say that fit all. Ireland is not
definitely pro—British. The Irish
are never definite about anything.
Right now the young-bloods say
they want to ace the fun over in
France. It's the traditional Irish
love for a fight that is behind their
joining the British army."

He recalled an old thirteenth cen-
tury Irish tone which sums up the
Irish personality and attitude
toward life.

 

‘Good utman's slaying,

Merry in the ale house,

Masters of the song.’

That is the feeling of the Irish."

At this point the doctor asked
the reporter not to place too much
emphasis on the war. “Politics
and war," he explained, “are the
complete antithesis of wit and cul-
ture. I prefer talking about lighter,
l‘lcllur things."

In response to a question on the
grclltent figure in the Irish litor-
ury renaissance, Gogarty retortcd,
“The greatest man in Irish liter-
ature? Not just Irish literature
but world literature. Why, William
liutlui‘ Yeats is the man. He's been
the leading figure in the last ten
years. “is winning the Nobel prize
emphasizes this."

Gogarty called New York the
grandest city in the world. "I
prefer New York to any city in the
world including Dublin. Why? The
town is a poem. It is a veritable
fulryland." He maintained that the
noise did not disturb him a bit,
"Why. it soothes the temper, doesn't
arouse it.”

At this moment he was called
upon the stage to present his ad»
dress. He left with the words. “Hope.~

 

I see you some day in Dublin."
