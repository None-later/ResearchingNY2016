Your Forum in Print

Theoretically and ideally, the STATE COLLEGE
NEWS should represent a cross-section picture of the
views and opinions of the student body; actually, it
does not. Rather, it reflects the beliefs of the NEWS
board in their attempt to interpret and express
student opinion. At this time we wish to say that
we feel this system is entirely inadequate for the
accurate determination of current student thought,
and that the remedy lies with each individual mem-
ber of the association.

Elsewhere on this page is a. column given over
to the publication of communications received from
various readers of the NEWS. This department was
created to allow for the expression of attitudes and
opinions of the various members of the association.
It is through this column, then, that the interested
person can cooperate with the NEWS in its task
of tapping the well of student thought. Write us
your opinion on any issue that interests you;
feel free to take advantage of this privilege to
see yotlr own thoughts in print ; make yourself
heard. Of course, all communications cannot be
printed, as that depends upon the nature of the
article and the space available.

Last Week in assembly, Mr. Kelly urged every
student association member to stand on his feet
and express his opinion on any issue, whenever the
opportunity occurred. We do likewise for the NEWS.
Make use of this forum in print!

Cooperative Buying

“Reduce the cost of living and I'll move into
a group house." For several years, expressions
such as these have been heard around the campus
and nothing has been done for the complainants.
We have a situation here which is rarely found in
other colleges. it is: each individual group house
purchasing its own needs from whatever source it
desires. Why not purchase the needs from a single
source, and save money by taking advantage of the
larger discount that would be offered to a coopera-
tive association?

The tentative plan would be as follows: the
sororities and fraternities (and other group houses)
would agree lo buy from one distributor, for ex-
ample, a grocery distributor. 'lach week the groups
would send to a single source (the cooperative man—
ager) its order for the entire week, The coopera-
livc manager would then bring together the type
of goods that each of the groups wishes to pur-
chase by giving the wholesale distributor a single
compact order. However, at tile same time, will be
sent the various individual orders which will be fill-
ed by the distributors anti sent to the various houses.

Discounts would be allowed on the bulk order,
The bulk bill would be sent to the cooperative man—
ager who, ill turn, would collect the proportionate

Commentstater

{THE COMMENTSTATER ls given the widest
latitude as author of this column, though the view-
points expressed do not necessarily reflect those of
the STATE COLLEGE News.)

Years may come and years may go, but: our
glorious traditional Campus day goes on forever—
we hope. We make it what it is. For us, it ls a day
of surprise—fun—and class spirit. For you, frosh, it
will be a new experience—your first Campus day,
God bless it. (May the weatherman be most kind!)

It will be a day when the frosh-soph rivalry
makes its first niche. Push~ball will bring before u
the eyes of the college, the brawn (??l of the com-
peting teams—men and women, for it's a day when
the weaker sex vies in prowess in their own quaint
little way.

But it's the evening that we veterans love best
of all—fun, suspense and pride. It will be the first
time this year when there will be standing room
only in Page hall auditorium, if you know what i
mean.

It is a night when each class, for the first time,
competes for honors in stunts. But above all this
fun and frolic prevails the deep mystery of the iden-
tity of the Queen. Who will it be?? When the first
chords of “Pomp and Circumstance" are played and
the door opens slowly, you can hear the snapping
of vocal chords, such is the terrific craning of necks.
And do those sorors keep their fingers crossed or do
they?? But: this is one time when the men around
here are conscientious about things—or people, and
this does make a little difference. 'Nuff said.

Yes, it's a. beautiful night; it’s colorful; it's an
awe-inspiring pageant; it's unforgettable. So please
don't; go home this weekend, frosh; you’ve never seen
anything like it, and it's free. Don't miss the most
exciting day and the most thrilling night of your col-
lege days.

Now for the more materialistic.
Are we all agreed on the fact that our commons
is the most popular haven in the State college??
And do we all agree that it is most: crowded at noon
when dancing is the special on the menu? Some of
us like to dance; others like to just sit there and
listen to some nice(??) music. Now, we're getting
to the point. Do you like variety In music? We can't
be “in the mood" every day. In case you haven't
guessed It, we're referring to records, which cost
money. Now, we were wondering, seeing there is
an overwhelming number of women in this place,
what is wrong in their contributing a few pence to
the little tin box for such a worthy alld far-reaching
cause?

I it C I I!
Get to bed early t'nlte, kids. There's a. big day
coming tomorrow. So let’s go, State and make it the
most lovable Campus day ever.

To the Editor of the ans:

Lust week there uppeured in the ans an article,
entitled “Frills and Figures." We. of Inlerfruler-
llily council, believe that the News could have used
the space to better advantage. Although we realize
thnl this article did not necessarily reflect. lllc View~
pollll of tile S'rx'l'l: COLLMUIC News, We wish lo lake
exception to the opinions expressed. The following
are our objecllons:

. The word “It‘f'lllti” is considered, among fruler-
lllty men, as an abuse of good taste.
.()ne-hundred and fifty fraternity men form n.
snlull mlnorily of the student body. Therefore,
your social reforms should attempt to seek the
greatest good for the greatest. number of peOpIo.
.'l‘he fraternities of State college receive llo aid
from the Student Board of Finance, are not
regulated by the sllldcnl ussoelulion, and are
not llllder the jurisdiction of the dean of stu-
dclll's office, ’l‘herefore. lilo activities of the
fraternities of State college ul'e the personal
business of the members and not of tile student
body at large.
. ilcfore writing criticism of lhls nature, we be-
lievo that the Author should investigate lilo nu-
thcnllcily of llle information used; especially
since the aulllort'ss is not uffllluletl Willi the or-
ganizations concerned.
Any information concerning the business of fru-
tcl'ultles may be obtained at any time from

developing a Ferdinand complex~

Ellie diplomat

Last week we were crowded off
this page—there just wasn't any,
room for talk ,it seemed—so this
week we're determined to catch
up on last time. People have been
complaining about the pun-ish—
ment they've been taking from this
column, and have given us to be-
lieve that they don't like to have
to look too hard for hidden mean-
ings and such. Hence: the new
policy is to bare the truth, if you
can bear it with us.

Much rheumatism and bad colds
have been hanging over from the.
KDR picnic last Sunday. Indian
ladder is quite a place, quite a
place! But people should wait un-
til it's dark for some things we’re
too discreet to mention. Al-ice
more in keeping with conventions
then—but we won‘t have any mar-
otta us on this subject. Some-
body’s bound to get it in the neck.
And while we‘re still on the pic-
nic, can an'yone explain some of
the combinations we saw there? It
Simmons that one of the boys is

he likes to sit: under a cork tree
and just snell the flowers, And we
wonder if a very good friend of his
is going to be (me) kcan on con-
tinuing his interest in a certain
chap(man). We won’t lo(ui)se sight
of them anyway. The miller of
the freshman class is sure keeping
the wheels turning, but what will
the outcome bed? He seemed to
be all staunch and stewart on Sun—
day-maybe he’s giving up his
dower-y rights.

And while we were speaking of
Ferdinand a while back, we were
reminded that someone, pretty 0-
Kny, has taken up the cattle bus-
iness—she's especially fond of hol-
stelns. Wii~san, ed-dybody would
be.

Great work being furnace boy,
we hear. Interesting work. In
fact, theres a tayl(or) going around
that one boy is interested in more
than one phase of his job~its
either a case of getting ricb(ard)
quick, or wearing his rubbers when
It (lor)aines. (Lousy puns, but
we just had to get this In).

At Potter club the other nite we
noticed that one chap-pail be very
hospltable if given the chance—
his motto is the more the omear-
(alter.

You just can't be sure of any-
thing anymore. There was one
Junlor that seemed a lone wolf——
we even belly wouldn't; date this
year—but after al-den we didn't
know that thing would be sharp-
(le) Frlday nlte.

There wasn't any holding of royal
court this weekend—we were rath-
er disappointedwit’. did seem as
if the duke and the king(sley)
might get together. And speaking
of royalty, have you laid your bets
already on Campus quecn~—lt's fun
to be fooled, but it’s more fun to
know. So, until tomorrow nlte,
when you'll all be in the know 
long live the queen!

The Critic A

Last Wednesday night State col-
lege had the honor of hearing the
greatest poet, statesman, doctor,
and wit now living in IrelanJ,
Oliver St. John Gogarty.

Hts speech was a scenic trip
through the literary history of Ire-
land. He expounded the modern
theory that the Irish literature in
all its descriptive beauty has exist-

‘ed in written form for over two

thousand years, and during that
period has had a number of re-
births or renaissances since the
coming of Christ.

Many of the noted leaders in the
Renaissance of the nineteenth cen-
tury were personal friends of Mr.
Gogarty —— James Joyce, George
Moore, William Butler Yeats, Lady
Gregory Padric Colum. All these
people figured in the founding of
the Abbey Theater, except Joyce,
who, by the way, has been Mr. Go-
garty’s enemy since Joyce publish-
ed Ulysses. You know it was in
this book that he immortalized Go-
garty by characterizing him as that
young, radical Jesuit, Buck Mulli-
gan.

Mr. Gogarty seems to idolize Wil-
liam Butler Yeats. as one of the men
most capable of representing the
true feeling of the sod people, on
the printed page. Yeats, he said,
was deeply affected by early Celtic
writings. He gave to the people
of Ireland an appreciation of the
"Heroic time.” He built up a Gaelic
moral; he built up the imagination
of the Irish people.

Perhaps the most intimate friend
that Mr. Gogarty has is George
Moore, who lives just across the
garden. Yet, when asked to des-
cribe him, Mr. Gogarty said, "He
is one of my dearest friends. He's
brilliant. He's a cad." Such a com-
plimentary statement is capable of
Gogarty, and Gogarty alone.

The Irish poet started us on a
trip around Ireland from “Tennis
Raquet Bay" (Bay of Ireland) to
Killarney, the Garden of Ireland.
But the vision he painted was so
brief that lt merely serves to create
an interest in his greatest work,
Around Ireland with St. Patrick.
This book has been applauded the
sensational force in the new Gaelic
revival. .

If you want to know Gogarty,
the poet, read the Wild Apple Tree.
Mr, Gogarty gave a wonderful
speech for the intelligentsia of
the audience, but it was wholly un-
suited to the college students. It
is a pity he could not be heard be-
yond the orchestra. Next. time,
Mr. Gogarty, talk to all your nu-
dlence.

Queen Will Lead Pageantry

Once more speculation runs high
as the breath-taking moment when
this year's queen will be crowned
draws near.

Although Campus da or! ina
in 1921, the first queen illeld cannula:
1922 when it was provided that the
students should select the most pop-
ular girl of the senior class. Queens
have often been selected in the
past not only for personal beauty
and charm but for popularity and
participation in extra-curricular ac-
tivities as well. This is borne out
by the fact that all but two candi-
dates are members of Myskanla.
| Competition Sharp

Queen for a dayl! One of these
five will continue the dynasty of
Campus queens. We're proud of
our candidates. and each is a dif-
ferent type of beauty with her own
sprinkling of personality, her own
dash of color, and a big slice of
‘charm. The running is going to
lbe close, and it all depends on
lwhethel' you like chocolate, vanilla,
or strawberry ice-cream. Of course
you understand that pulchritude is
only one of the several factors in-
volved 1n the selection.

Any student can appreciate Dr.
Bl'llbncher's value as an educator

,how many can enumerate the ill-
Illovations and improvements which
'hc introduced?

During the twenty-five years he

been selected. because of their acn-

compose the council.

Dl'. Brubnchcl', in 1022, spoke to
the. student assembly in order that
some kind of regulation might be
formulated to govern the freshmen
and sophomores, because of the
serious damage committed during
inter-class rivalry. As a result, Mys—
kulllu announced specific rules
which, although often revised, have
,come down to us.

Ill 1929, Puge and Richardson
halls. and Milne High school were
opened for use after the Slate leg-
islature hurl spent $850,000. This

.suln, which was on lssuu during
the gubernatorial campaign of
1026. provided the most lllodern

He never neglected the social life
of Ills students, since he realized
the need of future teachers to be—
come socially competent. Soon after
his arrival on the campus in 1914,
he personally aided the founding
of Gamma chapter of Kappa Delta
Rho fraternity. of which he became

 

possessor of one of the most indi-
vidual giggles?

Of course there is always specu-
latlon as to what color hair graces
the brow of the next ruler. Do
gentlemen prefer blondes. brunettes,
bl'owuettes. or red-heads? The re-
sult of past elections have revealed
them impartial but with a slight
leaning towards the fair-haired miss.
Of present candidates we have three
blondes. one brunette. and one
brownettc. By the law of averages
one might say a blonde would be
the. best bet but one can't tell really
what the preferred stock is this your.
