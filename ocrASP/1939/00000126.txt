articles designed to acquaint the

more informal relation.)

by Herman Kleine

‘Dr. J. Allen Hicks, professor of
guidance, comes to us from Iowa—
“and proud of it."

His formal schooling consisted
of four years at Grinnell, with grad-
uate work at Columbia and the
University of Iowa, where he re-
ceived his doctorate. Following his
success in the field of child psy-
chology, Dr. Hicks was awarded a
research fellowship from the Rock-
efeller Foundation to the University
of Iowa.

He served for five years as su-
perintendent of public schools in
Iowa and was promoted to the po-
sition of executive secretary of the
National Committee on Child De-
velopment. At the same time, he
acted as psychologist at the Wash-
ington Child Research center and
facutly member at George Wash-
ington university. (What a man!)
Dr. Hicks first taught in 1931 at

years. his friendly smile has become
well-known throughout the college.
“All I got out of college," Dr.

fessor from the Spellman Rocks? I ‘ .

ing rules kept him from seeing his
girl as often as he would have liked.
Present rumors indicate that Dr.
Hicks is a “shark” at ping-pong.

Gardening is one of his two chief
hobbies; collecting biographies, the
other. In his extensive book-col-
lection he owns many valuable old
biographies.

Dr. Hicks' educational philosophy
may be summed up in his own
words:

"The schools should be concern-
ed with the devolpment of whole
personalities. Emotional, social
and moral aspects of development
are frequently neglected because of
over-emphasis upon the intellec-
tual aspects of learning. Children
are still sacrificed upon the ancient
altar of grade and subject matter
standards. Education is far more
than knowledge."

Despite the presence of two chil—
dren iii his own home on whom to
practice his theories, Dr. Hicks
claims it's not all smooth going
even for a psychologist. On one
occasion. daughter Marjorie made
her father quite exasperated. Yet,

Weekend Jottings

Hit of first Camp Johnston week-
end: “Susanna” Beers' hilarious ap-
preciation of the camp theme song
(for the weekend)—“There was an
old man. ." Booby prize was
awarded to Janet MacDonald's
onion-flavored butterscotch pud-
ding. The most harrowing sensa-
tion of the weekend was that ex-
perienced by the whole gang, when.
after leaving camp in applepie or-
der, they turned around to see a
volcano of smoke pouring from the
chimney! Explanation: materials
for new fire laid in red hot fire-
place . . . well, it takes a long time
to learn everything. Nominations
for a tin medal as the best sleep—
disturbers extant: Knowlton and
Leggctt (as a TEAM!)

Proceeds of Council Meetings

The award system, revised two
years ago, is again being considered
for alterations. Gripes this time
seem to be concentrated upon the
non-existent wearing qualities of
the seal-engraved skins new award-
ed. Tentative substitution ls a. key

for revision are Louise Hessney,

MacIsaac and Susan Wing.

Since fall season ends November
l8, the winter handbook will be
appearing shortly—compiled and
edited by Ferne Grenier, Eleanor
Grounds, Betty Knowlton, and Ruth
Pearson. Brief advance neWS from
that publication indicates that win-
ter sports will consist of basketball,
bowling, swimming, skating, Skiing,
tobagganing, ping-pong and—may—
be——badmlnton and modern dancing
(aha, competing with freshman
dancing classes!)

Revival

In spite of last year‘s abortive
attempt to arrange a three way
play-day, sport’s festival or what
have you between State, Bkidmorc
and Russell Sage, this year’s Coun-
cil is forging ahead with a do-or-dic
spirit, trying to stage a similar
event sometime during the '39-'40
season. For some mysterious rea-
son these schools are loathe to play
around with State womcnm—but kccp
yer fingers crossed— maybe every-
body will get together eventually.

fared so well throughout the series,
having won two meets and lost
four. Since Delhi has a squad of

ever, Corey, who finished first in

year, inasmuch as he graduated last
June.

Hansen will definitely be great as—

running close behlnd Francello.
With these three men all timing
within ten seconds of each other
there won‘t be much room for op-
position to sneak in and place be-

one of the three should place first,
the other two stand a good chance
of being among the first four fin-

rapid recovery and ran the trial run
in good time. Gene strained the ten-
dons in both heels, but they have
mended and he will run tomorrow.

The second week of play in the
intramural football leagua saw the
pre-season favorites step into their
places at the tap of the heap. KDR
supplanted KB as leading team with :
two lmpreslve wins while the strong
Albanians maintained their pace
by continuing as the only other un-
defeated team although having one
less game ln the win column than
the leaders. KB, victim of an upset
at the hands of Robin hall on Mon-
day. toppled from its high position
into third place and may very likely
go lower.

The week’s outstanding contests
up through Wednesday’s games saw
KDR defeat College house, 19-0;
the Albanians down Avalon-Spen-

 

cer, 7-6; and KDR overcome the
fresh 24-0.
‘ Easily the feature game of the week
'was the KDR-College house game
§chnesday. It was a bone-bruising,
rough, hard game in which KDR's
‘.hcavily favored team was bottled
lup in their own territory for three
Eperiods. On the other side, College
lhouse, through Barney Tuttle's
great running and a blocked kick,
,threatcned several times, but could
'not score. The break of the game
[came in the middle of the last half
gwhen KDR blocked a College house
.klck and recovered in the end zone
for a score. Then in the closing
minutes of the game, played in
semi-darkness, KDR. struck sudden-
ly to score twice on Oksala's “sleep-
er." and on a pass to Howie Ander-
son. The second tally came after
the recovery of a College house
fumble. The underdog College
house team put up a great fight,
and if their play Wednesday is any
criterion, they have a. real outfit
for the other teams to cope with.

J. R. M.-

In the locker room the other day,
a panting barrier limping in from
a strenuous reconnaissance of the
byways of Washington park was
heard to mutter:

“Sometimes I wonder: what‘s the
use?”

Though carefully censored, put in-
to grammatical (7’) English, and
stripped of the pungent fumes of
llnament which bathed its original
utterance, this gem nevertheless
portrays something which we'd like
to expand upon.

Would you, dear reader. relish
a twenty minute trot through the
wilds of Washington park and the
back streets of Albany to be greet-
ed at the finish by a handful of
drooling neighborhood urchins?

We've elected to turn our har-
rier's random remark into an ar-
gument for added student interest
in cross-country. A run is by no
means a long, drawn—out affair—
and—it is nice to hear someone
cheering and see someone familiar
when you're hitting the stretch.

For the benefit of those whose
interest has already been whetted,
the aforementioned "stretch" will
be along Englewood place. leading
into Washington park from Robin
street.

Tomorrow's meet will be the test
for a triumvirate of freshmen re-
cruits. Two of these have high
school running experience behind
them. ,

Cooke, Albanian and CBA boy,
boasts both cross-country and track
work for the Academy. He cap-
tained the CBA harriers. Hansen
at Troy High lent support to a. num-
ber of sports including track, soc-
cer, and iayvee football. Denike's
high school sport at Banger-ties was
soccer.

Intramural council has requested
that We clarify some misconceptions
that have arisen since the begin-
ning of the touch-football season.

The first issue concerns the vital
distinction between a touchback and
a safety—a distinction over which
even some of the officials have been
at odds in recent games. When the
defensive team intercepts a pass in
its own end zone, a safety has not
been effected and no points should
be awarded. The official ruling
calls for a touchback with the ball
being brought out to the twenty
yard line.

Another point of dispute is the
matter of a three-man line for the
offensive team. Such a line is com-
pulsory under the rules.

Congrats to Intramural council
for its pald official system which
is working to perfection—an excel-
lent examplc ol' the “money talks"
adage. But—doesn’t it seem an aw-
l’ul odd way to insure the smooth
operation of a program that. after
all, is supposed to be based on pop-
ular interest?
