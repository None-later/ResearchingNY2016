Pass the Amendment

 

 

The amendment for the posting of numerical i
results of elections will come before the student 
association today for final consideration.

Also

an amendment to the proposed amendment will be

presented which will call for the
cal results after the final voting

posting of numeri-
takes place.

If the amendment to the amendment is accept-
ed, the NEws feels that the measure should re-

ceive the support of the Student

association. The

greatest objection to the original amendment was
the argument that with publication of the results

of revotes, vote trading among
would be encouraged. With

political factions
the measure thus

amended, this evil would be removed. and the re-
sult would be a constructive addition to our pres-

ent voting system.

Learning by Domg
In an address at the inauguration of the new
president of Hartwick college last Saturday. Dr.
Cowley of Hamilton college made a statement the
significance of which aptly applies to our own
institution. "In America,” he said, "we talk much

about democracy, but I am convinced that unless ,

we give our students practice in self-government

through the management of the
college, they cannot be expected

cracy when they take their places in the commun- ‘

ity."

When State's system

of student

tion at that time, headed by the late Dr. Brubach-
er, had this basic democratic principle in mind.

since its establishment. for at no

time has a single

student failed to meet his obligations in student

affairs.

the Sun: COLLEGE News.)

The Activities office was the scene of quite a
i furor the other day—as always—but this time the
j arguing and bickering was “much ado about some-
] thing." The question under heated discussion was:
,i should the State college symphony orchestra be in-
: stituted into our curriculum just as chorus or oper-
I etta. which have now found their regular place on

the school program?

, At present the orchestra is an extra-curricular
’activity to be indulged in if you have the talent.
the time. the interest, and the patience. after you
are all through with your regular school work. Of
course. there are many who feel that this particular
activity shouldn't have any preference over any
other outside-class activity. However, placing the
orchestra in the curriculum has its advantages. pro-
vided that the class be limited and admission be
granted by try-outs.

In the first place, it would stabilize attendance.
thus facilitating rehearsals. Full turn-outs for prac-
tice will happen more regularly when the students
know that attendance is being taken. A good re-
; hearsal depends upon everybody being there.

At present the members are working against a
great many obstacles. such as need for a set time
when they can all meet. If students could make a
definite provision for this time in their class sched-
ules. they would overcome this difficulty. Moreover.
since they are putting in so much time. having three
or four rehearsals a week, why shouldn't they be
rewarded with credit?

The symphony orchestra has already proven its
worth by the inspiring program given in assembly
last year. Bernard Perlman and his colleagues have
worked hard to whip the group into shape. but un-
less they can be assured of continued cooperation
and enthusiasm for their orchestra, the life of this
activity may be short-lived.

The Critic A

Where is the rep and enthusiasm in State college?
Can‘t we put on better stunts? I thought so until
Campus night! Usually we give fairly presentable
plays but this year we somehow fell short.

Personally. I think the laurels should have gone
to the sophomore class. Their stunt was cleverly writ-
ten and showed an intelligent knowledge of Shake-
speare that was still more cleverly parody-ized.
It was peppy. forceful and comical. Paul Merritt
stole the show by looking more like Ferdinand the
Bull than Caesar.

The fresh and juniors' stunts ran close behind.
Bea Dower and Denny Harmon did the most stupen-
dous. spectacular and daring stunt ever done on the
State college stage, when they took that nose dive
off the stage on the tandem.

Bob Waiter made the perfect Minerva. He had all
the feminine pulchrltude and grace of an elephant.
And that isn't any damning criticism, for it was he
, who carried the frosh stunt to its glorious finish.

" The seniors took the leavings again. But that. is

a good old senior tradition. We could expect nothing
t more! It was a clever idea for a stunt but was not

carried out to an actable form. Indeed it was more
.like a fifteen minute advertising program on the
l radio. interspersed by musical interludes. The people

so much dead weight that could have been eliminated. ;

The senior stunt was not too bad, in comparison
with the other stunts. for none was on a highly com-
mendable level.

The first Advanced Dramatics plays went off very
well. Congratulations to Shirley Van Valkenburgh for
her superb portrayal of an aged invalid. It was a
part that called for excellent acting ability. and Shir-
ley did give it her all.

pieces of acting too. Miss Groff certainly was tops
as the glamorous lit‘ll‘L'SS. She made an exquisite pic-
ture on the stage and did an equally good piece of
work.

cally feel her middle-aged sedentary nature when

college audience. Jack Vavasour was poor as an ac-
tor, but he rims have ability. He has the personal
appearance and good diction needed for an actor,
but he does not “let his emotions go" when he is put
up before an audience. He was too stiff.

Now, Pete Fulvio has the dramatic ability. but he
needs to work on his diction. Howaver, he did the
better acting in the second play. He was poised. He
slipped into his character easily and sustained it
throughout the entire play. Pete has plenty of ability

Campus day has come and gone—-
gleaving the freshmen with one ri-
lvalry point to the soph’s four—but
‘ it looks as if the fresh have a stunt-
ed growth—from the way things
were Saturday night. The sophs
may have the might—push ball
games are toss-ups sometimes tho’
—one guy tosses up the next one
—anyway, if ’42 has the brawn, ’43
certainly has brains—which may
get them a head eventually. With
due respect to Shakespeare and the
stunt which deserves all merritt,
the fresh were all right. No cases
of stage fright, were there, except
that the dust mop bob on Minerva,
certainly looked a fright. However,
this is just more waiter under the
bridge—to get on—.

We were afraid of very dower con-
sequences from that bicycle ride of
the juniors—or would it have been
[dale circumstances if the plank had
ibroken. Some nerve anyway!

Stop, Greekl And you too, mis-

since she can see no reason for
neglecting the fraternities in her
weekly write-up, she takes great
pleasure in welcoming the stronger
sex to this formerly feminine gab
column.

Rushing seems to be rushin’ right
along—SL8 threw a swell vlc party
last weekend, and tonight KB is
doing likewise. This weekend also
brings forth Potter club's baby par-
ty and the Boiler-maker’s Brawl
over at KDR. And speaking of
parties, we hear the Gamma Kaps
royally entertained about fifty
alums not long ago with a luncheon
a‘t Howard Johnson's, while PAT
is planning for an alumnae lunch—
eon at Jack's next weekend. Alpha
Rho is conducting a house warming
tomorrow night.

Since the opening of school, sev«
cral of the slsterhoods have an-
nexed new pledges. Let’s see——
there are Beth Pedley, Jean Sears,
and Eve Doyle. for BZ; Marlon
Leary and Elsie Johnson for Phi
Dell; and Kay Trowbridge and
Georgia Millea for Gamma Kap.
The KD’s are pleased to announce
as faculty members Dr. Harry Hast-
ings of the English department. and
Mrs. Hastings.

Formal initiations since Septem—
ber have been decidedly scarce
among the fraternities—the only
‘one on record being Bob Leifels for
Potter. But with the sororities it's

an entirely different story. Here's
the line-up . . . . Psi Gain: Geral-
dine Grlnter and Dorothea Dcvins;
Phi Delt: Ruth Keefer. Teddy

STATE COLLEGE NEWS, OCTOBER 27, 1939

 

Decisive Battle
Of Gridiron Play
Looms Monday

Pigskin Championship Hinges
on KDR-Albanian Tilt;
Both Undefeated

As intramural football play
rounds into the homestretch. pres-
ent indications seem to point to
Monday’s KDR-Albanian battle as
the decisive game of the season.
Both these teams. unbeaten in two
seasons—we don’t recall when KDR
was last scored upon—seem too
powerful for the rest of the teams
remaining on their schedules; so
the championship of the ’39 season
should hinge upon their meeting.

On the basis of respective play so]

far this year, KDR seems to be the
more powerful outfit. Their of-
fensive record is much better. They
have scored at least three touch—
downs per game so far, and de-
fensively have not had their goal

crossed this season. The Albaniansj
have had several narrow squeaksl

a 7—6 win over Avalon-Spencer and
a tie game last Wednesday with on
aggressive Potter Club team. How-
ever, lf the breaks go their way Mon-

day and the boys have a good day,j

Aside from Potter’s surprising
stand against the Albanians Wed-
nesday, little besides Tuesday's sub-
zero weather featured the Week’s
action. College House, led by Bar-
ney Tuttle’s fine play, moved from
last place into a third place tic.
They recorded a 2-0 victory over
Potter club and a 13-0 score against
Kappa Beta on Wednesday. The
baseball score of the Potter game
was the result of an automatic
safely.

Tuesday’s icy weather was not at
all conducive to good play and the
only feature of that day's action
was the first tie recorded in the
season‘s play. The evenly matched

Robin hall and Avalon-Spencer
teams played a 13-13 tie. Sprowls,
Bullner, and Ellis were Avalon
standouts, while Archer and EU-
snckt-i' showed to advantage for
Robin hull.

lowed by Marion Keables who has
amassed 243 points.

Incidental intelligence: the gold
circle in the middle of the regula-
tion target nets nine points; the
red circle, seven points; blue, five;
black. three; white, one. The black
“petticoat” surrounding the whole
target is a consolation prize—no
score! Maybe you can figure out
from the foregoing how many bull's
eyes the high scorers have achieved
so far.

Sophs Lend Rivalry
After Puslibull Win

 

Times have changed since the first;
Campus day back in 1921, but; not;
enough to erase that “old feel-
ing” one gets at this time of the
year after four weeks of routine
study and work. Where else can
one give vent to his emotions and
find out how the other fellow feels
about the same thing than in that
game of sanctioned homicide, col-
legiatcly called pushball?

The juniors overwhelmed a mol-
ley touch football squad of seniors
for a 19—13 victory to start; the al-
ternoon off. In the second event;
of the afternoon, a combination
team of Juniors and freshmen de-
feated the senior-sophomore squad
in an exhibition hockey game.

By this time, the verdant fresh-
men, cnthused by their hockey vic-
tory, had organized themselves in-
to a lively cheering section but; their
cheers died out; as the sophomore
women opened rivalry by breezing
through a relay race in record time
as the crowd waited impatiently for
the men to unleash their barbarian
brutality for the cause of two points.
The yearllngs' spirits rose again as
they hopped their way to an easy
victory for the potato sack point.
However. the sophomores surged
ahead again as they came across
the finish line first in the three
legged race.

Finally the much awaited hour
arrived as MAA officials rolled out
the six foot ball (which has be-
come egg-shaped since last year).
After some more delay the game
began, only to provide the biggest
surprise of the afternoon as the
sophomores, almost without oppo-
sition. scored in less than two min-
utes of play. Before the verdant
freshmen, looking even greener than
ever, could recover from the shock
of the first attack. the sophs pushed
over another goal. In another min-
lite and a. half, the sophs rolled
over a third tally to put them ahead
15-0. At, this time the freshmen
caught the idea of the game and
finally fought their way into soph—
omore territory giving them their
lone three points of the game. The
sophs scored again in the middle
of the second half.

ling play were: score—234i in la-
vor of sophs; casualties—three fresh-
men; aftermath—Jetty tired cat'—
cusses and two more points for the
class of '42, who now lead rivalry
4-1. the score they trailed by last
year.

Add ambiguities: our statement
of last week in which we voiced
our opinion that Intramural coun-
cil's paid official system is hardly
consistent with the aims of Intra-
mural sports.

Many misconstrued our comment
to be a scathing attack on the oper-
ation of Intramural council and
the men involved, which it; most;
definitely was not.

Actually no hidden meaning was
tucked away in its phrasing. Our
innocent; remark carried nothing
beyond a lamenting that student
interest falls short of producing
free, voluntary officiating at intra-
mural contests.

From the State School of Agri-
culture at Morrisville comes war
that the cross-country team with
which the statesmen are booked
to clash tomorrow has copped two
of its three meets thus far this
season. The Aggies have downed
the Colgate frosh twice. while once
falling prey to the Syracuse year-
ling squad.

Lust Saturday's cross-country trot
with the Delhi Soil-tillers taxed
the capacity of Washington park
with a record high attendance of
twenty-five. including both teams
and the usual run of neighborhood
kids. We pass on to Louis Fran-
cello a suggestion made to us: that
a running course be laid out with
the finishing stretch somewhere on

Purple and Gold '

Faces Morrisiille
In Second Start

 

Delhi Captures First Three

Positions A: Teachers
Lose‘lnitinl Meet

state’s cross-country team takes

to the road tomorrow and journeys-
to Morrisville where it will engage ..
the Aggies in the second meet at 

the season for the Teachers. The
Contest last: year was won by the
Morrlsvllle club by a score of 23-
32. This meet was run in a driving
rainstorm which turned the Wash-
ington park course into a. mud-hole.
Last Saturday, the Purple and
Gold began the current season by
losing to Delhi 21-34. Delhi placed
men in the first, second, and third
places. This close placing made a
big difference in the final result.
The first State runner to finish was
Gene Agnello who took fourth
place. He was followed closely by
Bob Cooke, who clinched the num-
ber five spot. Frank Hansen and
Lou Francello captured seventh and
eighth positions. Manley took the
last position by placing tenth.
Slow Time

The time for this meet; over a
short 2.4 mile course was a slow
17:33. Last. season, the record for
the 3.4 course was set at 17:20.
The first showing of the season
had several bright; spots which glim-
mered through all the gloom of de-
feat.
Gene Agnello’s finishing fourth
to lead the Statesman was not too
surprising. Gene has been running
in great form during all of the trial
runs. The injury to his feet has
apparently healed and he will prove
a big asset; to the team. Cooke and
Hansen lived up to previous expec-
tations. Bob captured the fifth
spot easily. Hansen uncorked a
brilliant; spurt to nose out the Del-
hi man who was threatening both
Francello and him. Although Fran-
cello finished far down, it is logical
to expect much better running from
him. All of the men expect to run
better on a longer course of 3.8 over
which all the remaining meets will
be run.

To Meet Alfred
Next week. State’s squad will
journey to Alfred where the Purple
and Gold will attempt to avenge
last year's 36-19 defeat.
