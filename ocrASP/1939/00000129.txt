Graduates Elect
Foley President

Extensive Social Program
Includes Bridge Club,
Dances, Athletics

For the first time in recent years,

 

 

 

the graduate students of State 001- _

lege have organized themselves into
a class comparable to the class or-
ganizations of the undergraduate
body. At a meeting on Wednes-

day, October 18, Joseph Foley was V

chosen president of the class. Other
officers are: vice-president, Anne

Brown; secretary, Jean Dusenbury; '

and treasurer, Thomas Casey.

The class had its second dance 

last night in the Commons of Haw-
ley hall and plan to have some sort
of gathering every two weeks thus
giving it a' more extensive social
program than that of any of the
undergraduate classes.

As last year, the male students
will enter the intro-mural program
of MAA with both a basketball and
softball team. Many of the grad-
uates are looking forward to the
sports program and “hope to do as
well or better than last year" when
they were the top team in the bas-
ketball league. Dennis Paper, ’39,
is the athletic director of the grad-
uates. They plan to play the win-
ner of the touch football league.
Among the other activities, a bridge
club will be formed and the grad-
uates will be able to participate in
a number of tournaments.

With 169 students in the class
plans have been made for what the
graduate students term, “a banner
year socially for the too often neg-
lected graduate students." The aim
of the class is to bring the graduates
closer to the under-graduates who
generally regard them as outsiders.

The social committee will be a
revolving one to include every mem-
ber of the class some time during
the year.

Miss Moreland, dean of students.
Dr. Beik, professor of education,
and Mr. Bulger, personnel director,
are faculty advisors for the class.

Dirty Football

(Continued from page 3, col. 2)
of proper regulations, to prohibit
the practice of dirty playing in in-
tramural games.

Secondly, I suggest that Intra-
mural council get together and make
a. few rules regarding the refereeing
of the games. Make the referees
more strict in their calling of fouls
and as a whole. make the elastic
six-man football rules more definitel
and specific so that the referee will l
be able to point to a definite rule,

 

when he makes his decisions. i

GRAD PRESIDENT

 

Joseph Foley, graduate of Middle-
bury, who was elected president of
the newly organized graduate class.

Symphony Orchestra
To Present Concert

The state college symphony or-
chestra, now in its second season,
is planning to present a concert as
one Of the assembly programs in the
near future, possibly before the
Christmas vacation. The selections
for the program have not been cho-
sen as yet, but they will be picked
from numbers now being rehears-
ed.

Started by the class of 1942, the;
symphony orchestra, a student pro-
ject from the start, has been rec-
ognized by the student body and
Music council, and has been allot-
ted a sum of $100 in its budget.

It is hoped that the orchestra
may accompany the chorus in its
spring concert when it presents
Boris Godounov. However. the or-
chestration is foreign, and there is
some doubt as to whether it can be
secured at a reasonable price.

Later in the year, the orchestra
will present a concert of its own in,
an evening program.

Pedagogue Elections

At a recent meeting of the Peda- ‘

gogue board. William Brophy, ’41,'
was elected business manager to

succeed Walter Simmons, ’40, who

has resigned. The new advertising
manager is Betty Kennedy, '41.

’Ibday there are about 1,000,000

cigar stores, drug stores, country and grocery stores where
you can buy cigarettes in the United States. These re-
tailers, and the jobbers who serve them, have built up
a service of courtesy and convenience unmatched by any other
industry catering to the American public’s pleasure.

THERE ARE ANOTHER MILLION people who
are engaged directly or indirectly in the transportation of
cigarettes to every town, hamlet and crossroads.

IT IS ESTIMATED that there are 1,602,000
tobacco farmers raising tobacco in 20 out of the 48
states. Good tobacco is one of the hardest crops to
raise and bring to market, requiring great shill and
patience from seed-bed planting to harvesting and cur-
ing. The modern tobacco former has done well the job
of constantly improving the quality of his product.

THE AVERAGE LENGTH Of service of the 13,230
people working in the Chesterﬁeld factories, storage
houses, leaf-handling and redrying plants is over 10
years. This means that every step in the making of
Chesterﬁelds, regardless of how small, is handled by peo-
ple who have had 10 years of experience and ability in
knowing their jobs.

TRULY TOBACCO OPENS DOORS to ﬁelds where
people live, work and achieve, and Chesterﬁeld takes
pride in its ever increasing part in this great industry that
is devoted entirely to the pleasure of the American public.

TO S M O K E R S, Chesterﬁeld Cigarettes have
always said, and now repeat, that in no other cigarette
mode can you/ind the same degree of real mildnessand
good taste, or the some high quality of properly cured
and aged tobaccos. Chesterﬁeld Cigarettes are made
with one purpose only...to give smokers everywhere
the MILDER, BETTER-TASTING SMOKING PLEA-
SURE they want. You can’t buy a better cigarette.

0n General [Zealth of Students

by Frcd Ferris

Frcshmcn might well consider the
hygiene department reports of the
past school year rclcascd by Dr.
Caroline Crousdulc. professor Of hy-
gicno.

In them is a timely warning of
the dangers which await freshmen
after Campus day, “one bite on
hand by sophomore in “why treat-
od." And danger lurks on cvci'y side
with six cuscs of poison ivy and one
of dandruff. Fin students were in-
jui'cd in automobile accidents whilc
six patients undci'chi. Operations
on tho vcrii'orm uppcndix, chcn
studcnts are no longcr troubch with
dist-used tonsils.

Advice was sought. for 2,204 ills
and in total of 2,772 Visits to the
llyillinc oii'lci- oi‘i'cl' u bclil'l‘ under-
standing of the hygiene department.

llr, Crousdulc was able to rcport
thut lhcrc wvrc "no serious (ici'ccls
among the class of '30 to warrant
rccommcnduiion against certifica-
tion for tcuching.”

With llic new plan of sch.»ci.iVe
admission, n complcic health eXum-
inution by the college. physicians
is required of i-vcl'y cundiduio. Each
your finds the general lchl of
health Of every mun increasing.

Sore tin-outs and colds are re-
sponsible for a large number of the
office visits from women. Tooth-
achcs. laryngitis, and tonsils also
rank high.

Men students sought cor’rsuita-
tion in large numbers for nose,
throat. and respiratory ills. and a
good number of men required ser-
vices tor iniuriea received.

By the end of the year, all stu-

 

dents wore vaccinated against small-
pox.

The largcst single expense in the
Infirmary fund is for refraction or
eye trouble. Each year from 80
to 100 students correct cyc defects
by the use Of glasses.

Fifty per cent of the freshman
class took the tuberculin test. In
the past five years only one very
early case of tuberculOsls was dis—
covered. The student withdrew from
college, rccovored and returned to
complete college work.

The Infirmary fund provided for
the mcdicul cure of 235 illnesses out
of the college. The new plan, adopt-
cd last year by the Student associa—
tion, provides an additional dollar
to the previous dollar and u hqu
contriluilion. “The new plan will
enable us to provide more generous
spcclul ciu'c, hospitalization, and
nursing."

Dr. Crousdaie offers several sug—
gcstions ut the end of the report.
More prccuution ut Frosh camp to
avoid taking (:old is advised. Lust
ycur fifty per cent of the students
returned with colds or sore throats.
llccuuso of more favorable weuthcr,
tho colds were not so numerous
last month.

The last suggestion is that the
infirmui'y fund be increased to $5.00
per student. Most colleges have
the larger assessment, which makes
possible a more complete respon-
sibility for medical care. “If we
could see our way clear to adopt
the $5.00 too. We would be in line
with the precedent tolloWed b most
advanced colleges," stat Dr.
Croasdale.

MAKE PLANS FOR SENIOR HOP TONIGHT

 

VOL. xx1v, No. 7

O

Cappiello Will Again Direct
Most Important Affair
of Senior Clue

COLLEGE INTEREST HIGH

Len F ennell and Orchestra
Will Provide Rhythm
for Senior Hop

The class of 1940 will open State's
social season tonight when it
presents the traditional Senior Hop
on the Hotel Ten Eyck Roof Gar-
den. Dancing will be from 10:00

 

Walter Harper, president of the senior class, and Joseph Cappiello,
general chairman of tonight's affair at the Hotel Ten Eyck.

 

To the swishlng of new gowns
and the crackle of stiff shirts,
the seniors will "hop" tonight;
“hop” to the solid swing and sen—
timentalism of Len Fennell and
his following of “jive” specialists.
From all indications based on past
performances, the class of 1940
will enjoy its dancing to the
utmost.

Fennell brandishes a baton bi~
weekly at the George F. Pavil-
ion ln Johnson City where such
bands as Glenn Miller of “ser-
enade” fame, Tommy Dorsey,
who tackles a trombone hard
and low, and Artie Shaw who
“began the Beguine," have lately
seen service.

With constant playing the Fen-
nell outfit has become a well
organized group which plays with
the precision of a forty dollar

 

micrometer, According to latest
reports by Santi Porcino, ’39,
who heard him last week, Fen-

Len F ennell, Featuring Latest Arrangements,
To Play Both Sweet and Swing Music Tonight

nell is offering nationally popu-
lar arrangements ‘of “Little
Brown Jug," “Begin the Be-
guine," “Back Bay Shuffle,"
“South of the Border.” and the
lastineg solid “One O'Clock
Jump." For an added measure
of dance delight he will toss in
a few personal concoctions built
around “Honeysuckle Rose" and
“I Can't Give You Anything But
Love.”

A bit of human interest has
found its way into the band in
the form Of one Al Brinkman, a
slghtless pianist, who gives a
performance that ranks with the
best. Tamer Aswad sweetens up
the sentimental sendouts in a
mellow baritone voice of the Ken-
ny Sargent type.

The seniors are presenting an
orchestra whose music will be
“running through your mind"
"day in and day out" for some
time to come.

 

 

 

Thanksgiving Recess

Dr. John M. Saylcs, acting
president Of the college, has an-
nounced that ’l‘hunksgiving vu-
