Policy on Communications

THE STATE COLLEGE NEWS announces the
following regulations in regard to the publication
of communications:

1. The NEWS welcomes communications
from its readers on all subjects. All communi-
cations should be signed, although names will
‘be withheld on request. Anonymous letters will
be published at the discretion of the editor-in-
chief and will be labeled as such. The NEWS
reserves the right to edit all communications
. without altering the essence of the original.

2. The NEWS refuses to divulge informa-
tion concerning authorship of communications.
Answers to criticisms which have been publish-
' ed will take precedence over all communications.
Personal replies to authors will be forwarded by
‘ the NEWS.

 

 

 

 

Appearing above is a statement of policy of the
STATE COLLEGE NEWS concerning all communica-
tions received from its readers. We print this be-
cause of certain repercussions arising from a com-
munication printed last week on the sports page.

The organization involved protested personally
to the NEWS Board and asked that the author of
the controversial letter be divulged. This the NEWS
Board refused because it felt that, if it did disclose
the name, it would be similiar to the actual publi-
cation of it, and in this way would be breaking the
confidence of the author.

Our point in consuming so much space here is
to emphasize to our readers our stand on this
matter. Should a similar misunderstanding arise in
the future, this decision will serve as a precedent.

A Step Forward

The graduate students have recently completed
organization as a class similiar to the four groups
of the undergraduate body. This is a step which
should prove beneficial not only to the graduate
group but also to the entire campus. In the past
years, the graduates have been more or less spec-
tators of campus activities, but now through their
own organization, they can take active participa-
tion in these activities.

Already the graduates have inaugurated their
social activtitics with two informal vic dances in
the Commons. We would beat like to see some
kind of affair, or a dance for instance, which would
be attended .by both this group and the under-
graduate body. Here in a friendly atmosphere,

both groups would be brought together, and the
barriers which have always existed between them
would tend to be eliminated.

 

Suggestions on Swing

 

 

 

Commentetater

(THE OOMMENTSTATER is given the widest
latitude as author of this column, though the view-
points expressed do not necessarily reﬂect those of
the STATI Cor.an News.)

What is missing here at State'.’? Off-hand, one
would say almost nothing. We have a college with
its library, cafeteria, lounge, rest rooms, and its vari-
ous activities—debate, dramatics, athletics, and re-
cently a symphonic orchestra, but do we have a
State Swing Band?? Not! Well, why not?! We want
one, and we need one, We have the talent—plenty
of it, and it’s all going to waste.

Wouldn’t it be a wonderful feeling to walk down
to the commons on a Friday afternoon, let's say,
about 3 o'clock and dance for a couple of hours to
the rhythmic strains of State's Swing Band ; perhaps
a different vocalist might be featured each week.

Then, pretty soon such a band could play at the
traditional college functions like Activities day, re-
ceptions, Campus day, Moving-up day, and others.
Of course, there would be no material retribution
for such service, but certainly the opportunity of
serving State in such a pleasurable way would be well
worth the time and effort.

If the symphonic orchestra could do it, why can’t
you folks who are just over-flowing with this thing
called “rhythm”?? All you need is a little push.

Come on, State; with a little raz-mah-taz and a
sis-boom-baz, we could probably blow the roof off
the commons (the floor of the library).

We need something invigorating around here, so
let it be a gala jam session under the spell of a siz-
zling swing band heie in‘ State.

Speaking of bands brings to mind this coming
weekend. Another year—~another Senior Hop. But
a new note is sounded this time-a State college for-
mal has finally met the general demand for lowering
prices of bids through the hiring of a less expensive
band. This column has approved of such a proposi-
tion before. It does so again! The band may not
be widely renowned—so what! So the music will in
all probability be just as danceable—and a lot more
people will be able to attend a college formal for u.
change.

So come What may, the seniors deserve credit for
breaking the path. Underclassea, take note!

There are two sides to every question, however,
which means simply this: the success of any formal
dance depends on more than low-priced bids. It
implies the cooperation of the student body by at-
tending! Tonight’s Senior Hop will give us some
idea of whether State College students will live up
to their part of the bargain.

The Critic A

Each week sees added improvement on State’s
stage; and, of the two plays presented on Tuesday.
the second was by far the better. Each character was
sustained throughout the play. Even when others
were in the spotlight, the minor characters remained
in character, each one an individual.

Mr. Blackburn and Mr. Withey shared the acting
honors, with Blackburn excellent as the fiery temp-
ered, yet devoted friend and Withey as the pathetic
Job hunter from Arkansas. We like the fight between
Blackburn and Fink staged on the apron and the
pitiful hymn-singing at the end. Mr. Hertel died
beautifully; and with that scream he could haunt our
house any time.

Perhaps the play could have risen to a higher pitch
by more response to cues, and the actors did seem
a little embarrassed and reluctant to use the language
of bums. But. the play was the best that State has
seen in some time.

In the first play. ably directed by Miss Hurdle,
Miss Scovtlle deserves the top honors. She was per-
fect as the wistful, charming young Rose Martha;
and by her clear voice and youthfulness, she suggested
the whimsical romantic mood of the play.

Too many of Mr. Cnssldy’s lines were blurred by
accent. and his voice. though greatly improved. does
not suggest the honey-tongued Irish poet-tramp.

But he can play a. vlollnll

Miss Trumbull, unfortunately, under-acted. She
looked the positivencss that should have marked the
role. We feel that she was a. bit stale, that she had
reached the high peak of her acting in some previous
rehearsal. Mr. Case was a solid, dependable Hiram,
but the audience was unable to understand him.

Mr. Meltz has introduced a new type of realism
to State, He is to be congratulated for his excellent
selection of cost, for direction of such a large group.
and for his original use of the back wall for the most
realistic set We have seen. Everyone certainly on-
Joycrl his play. Let's have more like it.

The Camel Swing Caravan rolls in twice a week
with two great swing bands. On Tuesday night there's
the Dixieland Music Shop on the Columbia. network
at 0:30, starring Bob Crosby and Johnny Mercer.
Bob Crosby’s Dixieland band swings the popular songs
as Helen Ward. Bob’s vocalist, sings the lyrics. John-
ny Mower acts as master of ceremonies and sings a
few songs himself.

For an entirely different style of swing. tune in
Benny Goodman and his orchestra on the NBC lied
network, every Saturday night at 10:00 o’clock. Fea-
tured with Goodman are several of the best exponents
of swing. including Lionel Hampton and Fletcher
Henderson. “The Benny Goodman Sextet," a unit
in the band, makes a specialty of playing novelty
swing numbers. The singing is done by Louise Tobin,

 

Benny’s vocalist.

Ellie iﬂiplnmsf

Once upon a time, not too many
weeks ago, there came into being
one Diplomat, so-called. But this
young lad, (or is it a lanai—alas,
nobody knows) had trouble with
his health—in fact, last week, he
looked a little sick. So, since the
general prescription suggested for
all illnesses of such nature as his,
was to throw out all those things
called puns, that's exactly what he
decided to do.

We've been wondering Just how
long it takes for fellows at State
to know a good thing when they
see it. Evidently, in one case, it
has taken longer than would be
expected -— but Simmons started
something Saturday nite, that has
been progressing this week in the
commons, what with dance dates
with tall Grade and all. May we
pun Just once? It shtrley tooker
a long while to break the ice.
And while some things are get-
ting started, we wonder what it is
that's happening between Kusak
and Ryerson. It's the week's cross-
word puzzle to figure out where
the sister of the co-editor in chief
of this worthy paper enters in for
Hop.

And speaking of sisters and co-
edltors, do you know that Kowal-
sky is importing a girl named Ll-
son—slster, Rose7—to the dance?
The Senior Hop has started a lot
of talk—and already people are
wondering how certain couples
happen. It seems that the Kluge
affair, so widely publicized in last
week's column, has gone up in
smoke. How about it, Stevens?
Quite unusual to see freshmen
at Hr first formal, but June Mel-
villc is also breaking that tradi-
tion—she'll be seen with the pac-
ifist of last week’s assembly, or
should we say, the proponent of
“sympathetic understanding," re-
member?

Will Milller is doing all right for
a freshman—only Why isn’t Doran
going to be in the picture Friday
nlte? And speaking of Hattie De-
F‘orest, it won't be unusual to see
Mary Jane there with Bosley. Or
Enes with Santi, or Priz with Bob,
or Fran with O’Hora. Some people
are like infinity—they just go on
forever.

We’ve noticed Howie Merriam in
the commons at noon with Jean
Buckman. Or doesn't this mean
anything?

Ask Lucy King about the Hai-
lowe’en party the other nite! She
must havo shocked the poor fresh-
man girls at the Dorm—it isn’t
the sort of thing one talks about,
so we can say no more.

 

Communications

 

 

To the Editor of
The STAT: Cannon News
Dear Sir:

Since freshmen are supposedly
unseen and unheard, may I use the
News communications column as a
means of being noticed?

Open letter to the Student asso-
elation:

Dear Fellow Scholars:

Will you please straighten out a
point for me? In last week's as-
sembly were we discussing the pos-
sibility of adding Mr. Agne'l amend-
ments to the Constitution or, per-
haps, were we attempting to help
Emily Post with the social amen-
itles?

By the latter, I refer, of course,
to the suggestion made by one of
my peers, i. e. we should oppose
the amendment because we must
have sympathy for those hundreds
of candidates whose feelings would
be hurt if the numerical results
were made known.

Well, goodness, if this is so, what
are we waiting for? Let's carry out
the “sympathy” idea to the bitter
end

Arise, samaritan! Besiego the fa-
culty! They must stop those hun-
dreds of tests they give every year.
For, if the lnestimable proponent
of Mr. Harris' theory is correct,
think, I pray you, of the thousands,
the hundreds of thousands, below
the median who hear (and quietly
enough) abused sensibilities!

Ridiculous, isn't it? We all know
ultimate success depends upon the
student himself—success or defeat
according to his own ability.

Therefore, my schoolmates, it is
beyond my simple comprehension
how the majority of you eminent
purveyors of knowledge could be
moved so thoroughly by such asin-
ine reasoning.

Truthfully, are you all thinking
of the underdog as the suggestion
intended, or may I misquote, in
fact, mangle Shakespeare enough to
inquire “if the sympathy, dear stu-
dents, does not live for the defeat-
ed, but for ourselves”—because
we've been high-pressured?

In my estimation, there was little
foresight or logic on the part of an
assembly which would defeat a
democratic measure solely on the
strength of such irrelevant ma-
terlal.

Yours for a Student association
.that does not take refuge in sub-
terfuge.

"Final Fall Fling,” this year’s Coun-
cil has planned an excursion to
Delmar on that date to witness the
exhibition game put on by the East-
ern Division Conference of the
Mohawk Hockey Association. The
games, which will last all after-
noon, promise to offer many point-
ers on good hockey playing, since
the participating teams represent
the best of women hockey players
in the east. Dorothy Peak, ’41,
is selling admission tickets at twan-
ty-five cents each. Bus fare to
Delmar may require an additional
fee.
Season Forecast

New sports and sports captains
for the winter season have been
announced by Council. Regular
sports for the season are basketball,
captained by Madalyn Beers, ’41,
with Dorothy Roth, '43, as assistant:
bowling, Blance Kirschenblum, and
Evelyn Ollvet, Juniors, co-captains;
ping-pong, Dorothy Peak. ’41, cap-
tain, Kay Peterson, '42, assistant;
swimming. Violet Caganek and Iris
Barnett, Juniors, co-captains. The
snow sports, which are conducted
only when snow appears, include
skating. Ruth Rockcastle, ’42, cap-
tain; skiing, Helen Lasher, '41, cap-
tain; tobogganlng, Virginian Elson,
'40. captain. Modern dancing may
be included in the program, but as
yet is not definitely scheduled. All
information about times and places
will be published within the next
two weeks in the Winter A. A.
Handbook.

Barn Dance

For their Jointly sponsored event
of these season, MAA and WAA
are planning a barn dance—the only
hitch is that no agreement on a
date for the dance seems to be
forthcoming. November 18 was con-
sidered at first, but too many
other college activities were sched-
uled for that time. The first week-
end after Thanksgiving vacation
is now being deliberated upon—

Still vainly seeking its initial vic-
tory, State‘s cross-country squad
will Journey tomorrow to Alfred to
meet the Agricultural school team
there. Last year, the Teachers were
turned back by a score of 19-30.
In this run, Guilford of Alfred set
a new record for the 3.4 course of
17:20, as Alfred sewed up the first
three positions.

Lose to Morrisvllle

This will be the last chance for
the Feds to win a meet, inasmuch
as it will be the last meet on this
season’s schedule. The Purple and
Gold dropped last Saturday’s meet
to Morrlsvllle by the count of 15-
40. The race was run in adverse
weather conditions consisting of
rain and snow which turned the
course into a quagmire. The route
led mostly through meadows, up—
hill and down-hill. The grass was
slippery and the runners were slow-
ed down by the fear of sliding into
a barbed wire fence which parallel-
ed the trail.

The running was very close in
this meet with but 42 seconds sep-
arating the first and tenth men.
Brady, of Morrlsvllle, finished first
with a. time of 16:02. Four of his
running mates tied for the second
spot with a time of 16:10. Fran-
cello was the first State man to
finish and he took the fifth po-
sition, being timed at 16:23. He
was followed closely by Cooke, and
Agnello, with Hansen taking the
tenth position. '

This meet was unique since Mor-
rlsvllle had a perfect score of 15
points. This occurs only when a
team captures all of the first five
positions. The last time 9. Purple
and Gold squad was defeated by a
perfect score was ’way back when
the sport was new here at State.

Brady, who led the Aggie squad
to victory, will graduate in 1940.
To make next season's prospects
even more cheerful, the only man
on the Morrisville squad who will
be able to run next season is the
man who finished down in the thir-
teenth position.

Alfred is noted for usually putting
out a top-flight harrler squad. The
team which State meets is com-
posed of students from the School
of Agriculture, However, if any of
those men show up well enough,
they may be elevated to the Uni-
vcrslly team. Then, they may run
for both the Agriculture school and
the University. Some of the var-
sity team will probably run against
State tomorrow. Because of this,
Alfred will be a top-heavy favorite
to win. However, to quote Manager
Franccllo, "Anything can change
'thc dope."

story of soph superiority. They
dominated play throughout and
missed two other scores after
driving deep into fresh territory.
The lone touchdown of the game
came on a short sleeper pass to
Al Bulmer early in the second
quarter. The only '43 threat, late
in the second quarter, was
abruptly halted by Williams' in-
terception.

The second half, played in the
rain, saw the victors release a
Dickson-to-Brauner passing at-
tack whlch kept the Fresh back
on their heels throughout the
rest of the contest. The ’43'ers
best offensive Weapon was the
running of Brierton.

As rivalry reached a lull after
two Weeks of activity. the stand-
ings disclose that only a “po-
tato sack" victory saved the class
of 1943 from a whitewashing.

Basketball Squads
Open Practice Drills

Activity started this week on
State's number one athletic front
as both the varsity and freshmen
basketball squads opened practice
sessions. The Frosh. coached by
.Will Flrament, '40, will practice
Monday and Wednesday at 4:30.
Coach Hatfield will put his charges
through their paces on Tuesday and
Thursday.

In Monday's opening session, only
16 freshmen answered Coach Fra-
ment's call. However, on Wednes-
day several more candidates re-
ported and increased the squad to
19. The first few practices will be
devoted to fundamentals, after
which the squad will start inten-
sive training in preparation for its,
12 game schedule.

On Tuesday, 17 candidates for
the varsity reported to Coach Hat-
field, and were put through a ses-
sion devoted to shooting and ball-
handllng. The full squad until the
first cut will be composed of twen-
ty men, almost all of whom have
previous freshmen or varsity ex-
perience. The seniors: Will Fra-
ment, Walt Simmons, Frank Kluge,
Bill Barrett. and Johnny Havko
are all, with the exception of Havko,
veterans of last year's team. The
latter was unable to play last sea-
son but he is definitely varsity tlm~
her. The Juniors: Roy McCrenry,
Gerry Saddlemlrc, Herb Oksula,
Arnie Ellerln, and Hal Duffy have
all had varsity or frosh experience.

From last year's fx'osh team eight
men have turned out. They are
Hunk Brauner. Paul Merritt, Bill
Dickson, Bob Hilton, Dove Lehman,
Milt Ray, Phll Kaufman. and Al
Bulmer. Another soph candidate
is lllll Archer who has had no

 

 

 

Touch football play reached a
low ebb in activity this week as
rain washed away Tuesday's con-
tests and a. forfeit the following day
reduced the week's slate to three
games.

However, the first of these was
the crucial KDR-Albanlan tilt play-
ed on Monday and as expected the
favorite, KDR, came through with
an 18-2 victory. We've said this
before, not meaning to detract from
KDR victories, but again, as on
several other occasions, the game
was much closer than the score
might indicate. With a bare four
minutes to play, the score was only
6-2 and though it seemed improb-
able that the Albanians would win,
it had been a hard fought contest
all along. Then under cover of
darkness, KDR struck twice on long
runs by Falrbank. one of which
was a touchdown and the other
set up a score. Twelve points were

 

utes and had turned a close con-
test into a rout.

In victory, the defending title-
holders maintained their three TD
scoring average but finally were
scored upon. McCreary stepped out

off the field. By winning. KDR
has Just about clinched another
title.

During the week's play, College
House assumed sole possession of
third place by defeating Robin hall
easily 18-0 and winning by forfeit
over the Fresh. Basketball prac-
tice has taken the Frosh team in
its entirety and it seems as if they
may have to forfeit their remain-
ing games.

Wednesday's only contest saw
Robin hall’s last minute touchdown
beat SLS when the latter seemed
to have clinched victory. But a‘
short fourth pass to Bliss with twen-
ty-flve seconds remaining to play

tallied in approximately two min-'

 

made it only a sixth defeat for SL8
and put them deeper into the cel-
lnr.

With the '39 Intramural grid Ia.-
son swinging into the final stretch.
it seems not altogether Inappropri-
etc that we should mimic general
sports style by discussing mathe-
matical possibilities of the cum.

In this we are faced with a situa-
tion remarkably similar to that ec-
companying September in the Am-
erican League or an impending Joe
Louis scrap. Recognizing that there
are other entries in the American
League, most sports writers. for
variation, or consolation. or some-
thin'. along about mid-September
begin to publicize the fact that the
Yankees may not win after all
——providing so-and—so plays 1.000
ball to the champions' .000.

And it's something of the sort
that we’d like to do here instead
of merely forecasting another KDB
championship.

Beyond the completed games list-
ed in our standings this week,
KDR's books show two more con-
tests, while the Albanians are sched-
duled for three.

Assuming a. KDR. victory over KB
yesterday afternoon. last year's
champs are left with six wins to
no losses with a Potter club en-
counter listed for Monday. The
worst the boys can possibly hit
then with a loss to Potter will be
an .857 average.

The Albanians, with one loss to
their three wins still have games
with KB. Robin Hall, and the Fresh-
men, victory in all three meaning
at the best a tie with KDR. And
it We erred in assuming a KDR wm
over KB yesterday, the Albanians
even have a chance for snagging
league honors.

But, too . . . there's tiny: I
chance that the Yanks may be over-
thrown or that the Brown Bomber
will be floored. We still like [03.

To Intramural Council: with in-
terest in football bound to start
skidding soon, and since most games
are being finished in semi-dark-
ness, why not compress the sched-
ule a bit to clean up the season
earlier? Friday and Saturday play
might do the trick.

Apparently experts in the pull-
Istic art are at a premium hero-
abouts, as will the pencil-worn in-
tramural boxing list dangling from
MAA’s bulletin board attest. In
response to Danny Buccl’o plea
for “all those who are interested
in learning to box, please sign be.
low." twenty-seven enthusiastic neo-
phytes have crammed the list with
their signatures.

State's chess world: much talked
about is Jim Glllen's sensational
climb from the foot of the compo-
tltlvo ladder to sixth position.
