F rosh Commission Members Hear
History of State ’s Traditions

by June ﬂaushalter

Would you believe it, but that
ravishing beauty in white in Draper
hall is at least 51 years old? Did
anyone ever tell you she was bought
with “blood money”? Yes, any stu-
dent who had to take a re-exam-
ination in any subject was forced
to contribute one dollar to the pur-
chase of that fair lady.

The freshmen were told this and
a lot more in Frosh commission
last Tuesday in a discussion led by
the faculty on the traditions of
State college.

Did you know that Miss Wallace
of our Latin department was a
member of the first Myskania?
Although the faculty had a
hand in the selection of students
for Myskania, the old Myskania
did the tapping (or trapping). And
howl Each Moving-up day the
piano would strike up a rousing
march, and the entire junior class
filed across the stage; those for-
tunate individuals chosen for mem-
bership were snatched out as they
"tripped" across the stage.

Are you aware of the fact that
the library was originally the au-
ditorium, where all the students
squirmed through twenty minutes
of chapel every day—with an ex—
tra forty minutes on Saturday to
insure their good behavilr over
the weekend?

Can you imagine State college
without dancing of any kind? Ah,
—but there was such a day—way

and bustles. The
President of the college at that
time, Dr. Waterbury. did not ap-
prove of dancing, and it was ac-
cordingly outlawed as a form of
entertainment. His smile of ap-
proval at those students who gath-
ered every noon at the door of the
room adjoining his office, and, ac-
companied by a piano, lifted their
voices piously in hymns of praise,
would have quite disappeared could
he have seen their companions-—
waltzing in the back of the room to
the music of these hymns. Then
came Dr. Milne—and June, 1890—
and the first official dance at State.
1924 was the origin of the most-
cherished of all Moving-Up day
songs, “Great Fires." Mr. Dens-
more, in speaking of this song, read ,
a letter from its composer, Dorothy
Davidson, calling attention to the
fact that it was originally called
“Great Fire"—the singular. The
great fire being the peculiar in-
spiration to do great things which
the College klndles in all its stu-
dents.
How many of the students ap-
preciate these glorious old tradi-
tions of State? How can they be
kept alive? Let us hope that some
foresighted, loyal son or daughter
of State will follow Mr, Densmore's
suggestion, interview "Dean An-

nie" and some of the older alumni,
dig into the old issues of the News,

I Members of Council

Elect Judicial Board

At a meeting of the Residence
council held recently, members of
the judicial board were nominated
by the council and chosen by the
administration. These members
are: president, Mary Arndt, '40;
vice-president, Ellen Best, '40; Ma-
rion Kingsley, Helen Provost,
seniors, and Charlotte Ritchie, '41.
The duty of this board is to sit as
a court to judge serious infractions
of residence rules. The trials will
be held in the President’s office.

The regular meetings will be held
on Thursdays at 4:30. One of the
topics to be considered is the old
rule that men must be out of girls’
group houses one-half hour before
closing of the house. which is 11:30
on Friday and Saturday, if the
couple intends to use the 1:00 a.
m. permission. According to Miss
Arndt, the board considers this rule
useless and unnecessary.

Residence council also ruled that
the familiar “Opcn house” is no
longer in existence. This function
will now consist of a blanket invita-
tion extended to fraternities and
men’s group houses.

Campus Queen poll, neutrality
poll, telephone pole and latest but

five students favor matrimony for
teachers, which shows that optim-
ism reigns high in the halls of State
as only 27 per cent of the teachers
in New York state at the present
time are married.

However, take note, ye members of
the fairer sex who hope to teach
and marry too, results show that the
men unanimously agree that a mar-
ried woman can’t teach and rear a
family at the same time, and do a
good job of both.

Signs of growing independence
among the females in this twen-
tieth century, men, can be well il-
lustrated by the fact that the ma-
jority of women admit that they
would marry a man whose salary

was not large enough to support
them in their habitual standards
and would continue to teach it their
husband's salary proved inadequate.
Alas, has it come to this? How soon
will it be before the stronger sex
wears the dress in the family?
The majority of both sexes seem
to agree that married teachers spend
as much time in trying to build
marital happiness as single teach-
ers spend in looking for someone
to marry! It might be interesting
to note at this point that of the
eighty-seven who answered the
questionnaires. only three men and
two women admitted that they have
no intention of interfering with
their teaching career by spending
time in looking for someone to mar-
ry. Can it be just disinterest, or
precaution in not wanting to commit
themselves?

Pi Gamma Mu to

by Alice Abelove

Pi Gamma Mu, national honorary
society in sooial studies, is “making
history" in the history of State col-
lege. This organization. founded
here in 1932, has developed from
a discussion group to an integral
part of the social studies depart-
ment. This year the members have
adopted a program which, in prac-
tice, makes them a part of our fac-
ulty.

The program suggested by Dr. D.
V. Smith, professor of socal studies,
and Mrs. Eglcston, instructor in so-
cial studies, is designed to give the
students experience—such as they
might expect when they are teach-
ing—by the following methods.

When faculty members are ab—
sent, Pi Gamma Mu members will
take over their classes. Moreover,
they will conduct remedial classes
for freshmen who are behind in
their studies.

It has also been suggested that

do you know what the fair really
is? Did you know it is one of the
most important dates on the Milne
high school calendar?

It all began four years ago when
the senior class, under the direction
of Miss Wheeling, supervisor of
English. sponsored the first book
fair and hobby exhibit. It was so
popular that it became an annual
affair, and a traditional activity of
the senior class, a project in which
every member of the graduating
class participates. Under the guid-
once of several practice teachers.
the students plum and build the
entire exhibit. and make the neces-
sary arrangements.

Practice teachers supervising the
affair this year are: June Amacker,
Marcia Brown. Dorothy Hill and
Rita Sullivan, seniors. “County
Fair" has been selected as the theme
this year, and the Little Theater
where the fair is always conducted,
will take on all the atmosphere one
connects with that picturesque phase
of American agricultural life.

Juniors to Stage
Rally in Commons
0n Armistice Day

Entertainment to Include
Stunts, Songs, Skits
on War and Peace.

Merrill Walrath, president of the
class of 1941, announces that the
junior class will conduct a party
in the Commons of Hawley hall to-
morrow night from 8:00 to 12:00
o’clock.

The theme of the party will bear
out the idea of “Armistice day.”
William Brophy, general chairman
of the affair, says, “We juniors are
really going to celebrate this Armis-
tice day because it may be last
Armistice day we'll ever celebrate."
There will be no charge to members
of the class of 1941.

Expect Turn-out

Last year at this time, the clan!
of 1941 presented a “Suppressed De-
sire" party which was well attend-
ed. Brophy expects a large turn-
out for the first junior party of the
year.

Arnold Ellerin is in charge of en-
tertainment. He plans a combina-
tion of stunts, songs, and skits, re-
volving around the war and peace
theme.

According to Walrath, the party
is designed to revive the spirit of
the class. “There has been a lag,"
says Walrath, “The spirit is there,
but it must be re-awakened. If
'41 comes through the way it al-
ways comes through, lt will be a
bang-up party."

To Decorate Commons

The Commons will be liberally
decorated with flags, guns, and
01ch branches. This will not be a
costume affair. Refreshrnents will
be served during the evening to the
music of the Commons’ “via.”

The chairmen for the various
committees are the following: gen-
eral chairman, William Brophy; ar~

ments, Marilyn Groff; publicity,
