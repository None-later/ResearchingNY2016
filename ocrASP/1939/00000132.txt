“Let It Withdraw?”

Permission to continue the 1938-39 point rat-
ings was granted by the Student association last
year with the explicit understanding that the Point
System Revision committee would begin imme-
diately a revision of the old procedure and submit
its recommendations early in the fall. To date,
nothing has been heard from this committee. “Not
only has it been dormant, to all intents and pur-
poses, it has been non-existent.”

Is it the intent of the Point System Revision
committee to continue the laxity of enforcement
which has characterized the operation, or better
stated, failure to operate, of the system in previous
years? Is it the intent of the committee to con-
tinue the point system as State’s number One farce?
If not, why have no violations of the present sys-
tem been reported? Why has no action been taken
on the formation of a new system?

State college needs a point system. But it
would be far better to return to the pro-point sys—
tem days rather than continue a system unsound in
theory and unworkable in practice. If the com-
mittee is to be at all sincere in the performance
of its duties, it must get to work. It must offer
a plan which is not doomed to failure at the very
outset. In evolving such a plan it might be well
to give serious consideration to the following recom-
mendationsr

1. Under the new setup, the conunittee must
possess the power to punish all offenders. Too
long has this body been a ‘glorificd research bureau’
for Student council. Passing the punishing buck
has not worked.

2. All thought of using a mathematical formula
should be forgotten. finch office should be con-
sidered as an individual case. Hearings should be
Conducted before points are allotcd any office.

3. The new system must be a flexible one. The
committee should be givcu ‘interim jurisdiction' to
administer details of operation not important
enough for consideration by the student assembly.
This, power would include: the right to lower and
raise-point ratings and make such additions and
changes as it deems necessary. Such changes would
he tcnniorary in nature and require two-thirds
z pproval of the committee.

Every year the NEWS has sounded out against
the point ,syslcm; this year is no exception. Will
smile action be taken? Will some attempt be made
to make this system serviccablc to the Student as.
sliciatlrin?" If not, we say “Let it withdraw! l”

STATE COLLEGE NEWS, NOVEMBER

 

Resurrection!

 

 

Commentstater

Far be it from us to let sleeping dogs do anything
but lie, but if you can give ten good reasons why the
following particular little bow-wow should be allow-
ed to snooze any longer, you're better than we are.

Last year an editorial in the Sure COLLEGE News
of March 31 proposed a policy of Friday afternoon
dancing in the commons. So what happened? Stu-
dent interest was aroused temporarily; the idea was
generally accepted as a “swell suggestion"; and the
administration, according to all reports, expressed ap-
proval of the plan. So what, momma?? So nothing,
son—nothing at all. This proposition proceeded to go
the way of countless others. It died an unhappy
death. and unless action is taken soon. we suppose
a funeral is in order.

Now, why must such a well received proposal
gradually sink to the insignificance of the filling of
an annex sandwich? We’re for Friday afternoon
dancing in the commons from 3:30 to 5:00 o'clock as
suggested in the aforementioned editorial. Surely
the emptiness of the library and the congestion in
the commons at this particular time indicates the
feasibility of adding such a social function. Bridge
games. ping-pong. chess, and rushing don't seem to
quite fill the bill for the average student who is
drawn to the commons to “get a lift" from the week's
school work.

Class and committee meetings. 11510 and 12:35
classes. and practice teaching have managed to keep
too many students from enjoying noon-time dancing.
These students would surely benefit from the pro-
posed plan-»-and even those unfortunates with 3235's
on Friday could enjoy a half hour of dancing. Since
there are no other events scheduled for Friday after-
noons, this intellectual and social gap might well be
filled in a manner which so obviously benefits stu-
dent social contacts. Remember how well the after-
noon sessions of dancing on the days of our dismissal
for Thanksgiving and Christmas recess were received
last year? Let's dance!

To the Editor of the STATE CoLLccs News:

This letter is in answer to that unwholcsomc mis-
sive published by you in last week‘s paper and signed
“A Freshmnnette.”

My dear Freshmanette:

I am afraid that perhaps the balcony is far too
conducive to sleep; you seemed to have lost the
entire logic of the debate against Mr. Agne's amend-
ment. We were not attempting to aid Emily Post
nor spare the feelings of fellow students.

However, we were attempting to preserve the
democracy at State college which we already have.
For your benefit I shall recapitulate the reasoning
which defeated Mr. Agne's amendment; this (as
shown by the vote) is not necessary for the rest of
the student body. We opposed the amendment be-
cause we thought lndependent candidates would be
afraid to run for fear they would not get any votes
and thus be disgraced.

Secondly, We wanted to know why it was more
democratic to publish the votes than not to publish
them. Is it more democratic just because the na-
tional government does it?

The student body deserves the highest praise for
defeating the amendment. Those who voted for the
amendment and those who voted against the amend-
ment acted as they thought best. not because they
were high pressured!

Arthur Sold. '40.

Dear Editor:

We. the students of State college, pride ourselves
on our democratic form of assembly but there is one
phase of It which Is incompatible with this view.
Not every one who athnds assembly has the right
to indulge in the most important part of democratic
government, namely that of voting. There is no doubt
in my mind that this situation should be rectified.

With this point of view. I am proposing the fol-
lowing amendment expressly striking out Article III
which reads as follows:

“All regularly enrolled students of New York Htuio
('ulll'uu for ‘l‘cuclu-ru uml any sprclul students of thin col-
Ic-uo ulmll Ill‘l'lllllu Inclulmrn of thin MNMH'IIIIIIHI Ilpon nil)"
ment of tho Ipiuulu'l tux."
and substituting in its place the following umcndmcnt:

"All rcgulurly cnrolicd umll-I'gruduuln student» of Ncw
\‘orh thil- (‘ollcgc for 'l‘cuclu-ru uro mcuihcrn of thin
nanoclnllou.”

The following are some substantial reasons to
warrant the adoption of this proposed amemhnent:

(The flingith

No news is good news. So this
week must be a good one, for there’s
been a definite lack of anything
happening. Anything. that is, that
wasn't really expected.

We expected Joe McKeon to go
to Senior Hop. but there was a little
bit of a surprise when we learned
whom he took. Sort of a case of
keeping in the Simmons family.

We expected Alma Knowles at
Hop, too. but the Joe Rowland
angle wasn't quite the usual thing.

We expected more. too, that didn’t
disappoint us like: Del Galonlan
getting two freshmen on a string
at once—Feeney, and Singer—and
Muriel Scovill. that cute little
freshman. looking very happy last
weekend with a boy from back home
—and invasions from Union anu
Law School that you can inquire
more about by asking Ruby Stewart
and Alice Brown.

And so everything has been rath-
er usual and unsurprising. Not to
Bob Walter tho—the noonday brawl
in the Commons last Friday, that
some like to call rivalry. (all in
the spirit of fun), ended in a torn
coat among other things for him.
That’s the result of freshmen not
learning the alma mater when they
should. You can't get. away with
anything with Merritt and his class.

Have you heard about the new

plan Kelly is inaugurating for him—
self—beginning in the near future
-—he's decided that a rolling stone
may gather no moss. but it sure
does have a lot more fun—anyway.
it's worth trying.
Tuesday was a great day for Sen-
ator Grattanwfunny he doesn't get
interested in girls and stuff like he
does in politics. Interested in just
one, that is. Van Ellis is decidedly
not suffering from that trouble—he
seems to be rather settled in his
preference for Millie.

slsters’ disapproval. Sometimes it's
better to be conventional!

We expected a girl to be interest-
ed in who made the varsity basket-
ball squad but we didn't expect her
to come all the way up to school at
night to see if Ellerln did make it.

Down in Kappa Beta. it's now

In Monday’s Win;

CH Tiger Twice ,

Another season of Intramural!
football went into the books this
week as Kappa Delta Rho rolled on
to its second consecutive champion-
ship by sweeping through the last
two contests on its eight-game
schedule. On Monday the titlehold-
er’s clinched what was already a
foregone conclusion by smashing out
a 13-0 victory over Potter club.
Wednesday it won by forfeit over
Avalon-Spencer. This powerful out-
fit has now swept through two un-
defeated seasons, durlng which time
only a scoreleSS tic last year could
be considered as a blot upon a great
record. One hundred and fifty-
nlne points were rolled up in seven
contests this year while KDR's goal
line remained uncrosscd. Only two
points, on automatic safety, mar-
red nnotherwisc spotless defensivei
record. Although the “champs”
have a squad equally versatile, their
superiority over all other teams Illl

their great success.

Last year's mystery was the lo-
cation of the phantom burglar who
continued to wreak havoc upon
the site of Camp Johnston. This
year's unsolvable problem is the
location of WAAera who have a
live, active Interest in this season's
sports. Incxplicable and provoking
is this unprecedented absence of
devotees of fall sports. Of course,
in the past some certain sports
have lacked the magnetic pull
which others possessed. At pres-
ent this is not the case. All the
sports are suffering from the same
blight—lack of interest.

Where does the fault lie? What
is the cause for this apathy? The
program of the association has
been pared down to prevent dissi-
pation of interests on the sports
program presented; and incidentally
to avoid conflict with the varied

.activlties connected with other or-

ganizations. The policy of the

,associutlon is now to offer a small-

cr choice of sports in one season;
but, by varying the types present-
ed each season, to provide a wide
selection throughout the whole year.
Therefore, further diminution of
each season's sports would result
in almost u total cessation of the
association's activities.
Publicity for the
program has been adequate.

association's
Per-

haps it should have been superla-

tive, instead of merely udcqunte.
Perhaps this season’s fiasco can
be an object lesson to future pub-
licity directors to plaster sports
all over the place; to learn to rely
upon other media besides publi-
cations nnd bulletin boards; to
realize that word of mouth adver-
tising is most potent —— how else
would whispering campaigns be so
effective? “A picture is worth a
thousand words.” Hence the sight
of an enthusiastic AAer participat—
ing In her favorite sport with ob-
vious enjoyment. and telling
people about it, should be worth at
least ten posters. Still these enthus-
iastic ones cannot huttonhole all
the women in the college. There-
fore posters and announcements
and handbooks are indispensable
in backing up the verbal publicity.

were still in vogue, the association's

State’s Runners
Conclude Season

Alfred Aggies Inflict Third
Loss by 16-39 Score;
Agnello Shines

Another season of cross country
has ended with the State barriers
still seeking to dent the winning
side of the ledger. The Purple and
Gold runners travelled to Alfred last
Saturday and lost their seventh con-
secutive meet by a score of 16—39.

Beyer of Alfred finished first with
a time of 16:17. He was closely fol-
lowed by three more of his team-
mates. The first State man to break
the tape was Gene Ag'nello with n
time of 17:13. Bob Cooke placed
seventh and was followed by Han-
sen. Frnncello, Manley. and DeNike,
In that order. Agncllo performed
very brilliantly this season, and. af-
ter a slow building-up process, show-
ed all of the form which was ex—
pected of him. The freshman talent
also gave promise of brighter sea-
sons to come as they finished well
up in front of the State runners.
With Agnello, Cooke, Hanson, De—
Nike, Manley. and Snover as a nu—
cleus, State should have a much im-
proved team next season.

At the beginning of the schedule
just completed, the Purple and Gold
squad looked rather weak. After a
few weeks of training. the men were
all in good condition. and the run-
ning of Cooke and Hanson threw a
much more favorable light on the
season. Then came the first meet,
against Delhi on the Washington
Park course. The Teachers lost this
meet by the close score of 23-32.
Gene Agnello placed first for State
as he took fourth place. Cooke fol-
lowed lilm close to finish as num-
ber five.

Next, State journeyed to Morris-
villo where they competed against
a strong Aggie squad. The speed of
the “soil-tillers" can be easily seen
since they ploughed the Teachers
under by a 15-40 score. F‘rnncello
was the first man to finish and he
took fifth place. He was closely
failed by Cooke and Agncllo. Mor-
rlsvllle had four men tied for first
place as they literally ran away from
the statesmen.

For two consecutive years now the
barriers have gone without victory.

l. R. M.'

It's a sort of “we knew it all along"
feeling that keeps us from being
over-exuberant at the way KDR
ploughed through opposition that
was by no means entirely feeble
to their second consecutive Intra-
mural touch-football championship
this week.

In fact. when. since the first
kickoff some weeks back. was KDR’s
second championship ever disputed?

In lieu of over-exuberancy, we
can at least offer a toast to a team
that has really taken its football
seriously and won league honors
fairly. Among the vanquished are
those eager to dispute this latter
point; frankly we can't see their
point.

True, KDR's record may have its
blemishes. but are they actually
more pronounced than those in-
curred by the other teams? At any
rate. they hardly seem glaring
enough to detract in any measure
from the champs‘ sweep to their
second consecutive leagUe victory.

To Bill Brophy goes much credit
for his keeping the winning com-
bination well organized. To all
those who participated—congratu-
lotions!

Incidentally, we. as many others,
are wondering at this rumor that
the grads will organize a team to
meet KDR. Intramural council
assures us that it has no official
word of such a tilt. How about it?

What's happened to this thing
called cross country? Saturday’s de-
feat at the hands of Alfred marked
the seventh consecutive State loss
in two years. We passed off last
year's winless season as an off-
year. but with a similar record on
the books for 1939, we’re wondering.
Can we do the same?

A few weeks back We recall cam-
paigning for added student inter-
est in cross country. Now we won-
der whether our arguments were
so hot. It’s like the old question
of the hen and the egg; which
comes first. the rah-rah spirit or
the winning team?

The ever-present chess team,
whose season never ends. will our-
ry on Its tradition of meeting the
biggest Inter-collegiate competition
of all state groups with a journey
to Ithaca tomorrow to clash with
Cornell. State chessmen who will
participate include Art Fox, Steve
Shaw, John Iloose, Bob Patton.
and either Roy Sommcrs or Jim
Gillcn.

v New Season to Open

After Thanksgiving;
Beers to Supervise

WAA basketball will have under-
gone a complete change when the
season opens after Thanksgile
vacation, according to Madalyn
Beers, '41, captain of basketball. This
change consists mainly of the elim-
ination of class teams and substi-
tution of teams from the residence
halls and the commuters forming
an intramural tournament. How-
ever. this plan will not interfere
with the traditional soph-frosh rl-
valry teams, which will try for two
out of three games. The team win-
ning the two games will capture
rivalry.

The intramural teams will consist
of one or two teams made up of
girls from the dorm, one team each
from Newman Hall, all the cooper-
ativa houses combined. all sororities
combined, and from the commuter
group. Girls playing on the rivalry
teams will still be eligible to par-
ticipate in the intramural tournaé
ment. The team winning the larg-
est number of games will be pre-
sented with a basketball cup.

Florence Prosser and Madeline
Hunt. class managers for the senior
and junior classes respectively, will
assist Madalyn Beers and Elsie Roth,
'43. in carrying through the program.
Managers for each of the Intra-
mural teams will be chosen from
the groups which they represent.
Dorothy Roth. '43, and Hattie De-
Forest, '42, will manage their class
teams during the rivalry games,
which will be independent of the
tournament.

Girls who are trying for basket-
ball credit must participate in ten
hours of general practice. and play
in two-thirds of the intramural
games.

The teams will play on a regular
schedule which will be published on
the WAA bulletin board the Monday
after Thanksgiving vacation. Un-
less otherwise notified. the games
will be played on Wednesday nights
from 7:00 to 9:00 o’clock. The gen-
eral practices for all the girls will
be held on Monday from 3:30 to
5:00 o’clock. Wednesday from 4:15
to 5:00 o'clock. Friday from 4:30
to 5:00 o’clock. and Saturday morn-
nings from 10:00 to 12:00 o’clock.

Beers announced that all girls
interested in the sports should sign
up with their group's team and
make this new method of basketball
participation 11 success.
