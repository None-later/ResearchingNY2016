Vaudeville Moises the Headlines

Unique Tradition

A
v
say.

It means that a new spirit
has been born in the journalistic
circles of NYSCT. The pen has
been swapped for the "treaded

boards.” The News of the future
may be published orally in the
student assembly —— with feeling

and gestures. What an innovation”
Think of it. Soon we may see a
poster reading: The News spon-
sored by Advanced Dramailcs will
present “Printer's Ink and Paper,
in three blots, or. “The News and
Statesman will have a competitive
talent show in the Assembly soon.’

You think this is radical _and
impossible—not at all. This Jour-
nalistic vaudeville show has set up
a tradition; and traditions grow like
moss on the left hand side of a
tree facing east. Did not some-
body once say “From little ideas
big things do come"?

I Newman Club to Have

Newman club will sponsor a sports
dance as one of its annual affairs in

Enes Novelll, '41, general chair-
man, says that “girls and boys
shouldn't be afraid to come stag be-
cause variety will be the spice of
the party." There will be square-
dancing, and jitterbugglng.

The committees for the dance are:

Extensive Record

The Cossacks are now in their
sixteenth year as a choral organ-

country of Europe and other con-
tinents. To date they have pre-
sented more than 1,800 consecutive

.. concerts—a record which no other

The program offered by the Cos-
sacks is a colorful collection of the
songs of the Russian “old days.”
As in the past the program will be
[divided into three groups so that
,those attending may enjoy the se-
lections more fully. Lightly-sung
church music. quaint, dreary folk—
l songs, and rousing military arrange-
;menis accompanied by the cus-
