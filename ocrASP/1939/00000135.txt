c Tobaccos

  

THERE ARE FOUR TYPES

of tobaccos found in the more popular
cigarettes, namely. . . Bright, Maryland,
Barley and Turkish.

ALL THESE TOBACCOS except Turkish (which is
bought direct from the planters in Turkey and Greece)
and lVIai‘yland (which is bought through sealed bids
under government supervision) are bought at public
auction, just like any other auction where you might
have bought in a table or a chair.

AT THE AUCTION SALE the tobacco is piled in
baskets weighing from about 100 to 500 pounds and
each purchaser buys all of his tobaccos by competitive
bidding for the particular piles he wants.

THE CHESTERFIELD BUYERS buy the best of
these mild ripe tobaccos for the Chesterﬁeld blend.
And it is Chesterﬁeld’s Combination . . . the right amounts
of Burley and Bright. . . just enough Maryland. . . and
just enough Turkish—that makes the big dilTercnce
between Chesterﬁeld and other cigarettes.

IT IS BECAUSE of this combination
that Chesterﬁelds are COOLER, have
a BETTER TASTE and are DEFINITELY
MILDER. They are made of the world’s
best cigarette tobaccos. Y on can’t buy
a better cigarette. >

lege, it is expected to uphold the
reputation made by last year‘s
“Ten Nights in a Barroom," The
boys of Central avenue will "thesp"
Wednesday and Thursday nights on
the boards of Page auditorium.

This tear—jerker is the tragic story
of a young newlywed who in a
ﬁt of jealousy. deserts her home
and family for an unprincipled vll-
lain. Her death at the family home
where she returns in disguise will
melt the heart of the coldest “Puri-
tan."

turn to the scene of their former
triumph. Louis Greenspan. '41.

: Varied Program to Consist

of Sacred, Military
and_Eolkﬂusic

Once again State college will
have the opportunity to hear one
of the most brilliant choruses in
Ithe world, when Music council
brings the original Don Cossacks
under the direction of Serge Jaroff,
to the Page hall auditorium on
Tuesday evening, at 8:30 o’clock.

In the ﬁfteen years of their ex-
‘ istence, the Don Cossacks have pre-
sented 4,000 concerts—a record that

 

‘has never been equalled—and are

now returning to America for' their
tenth triumphant tour.
Colorful Background

The Don Cossacks, the last sur-
vivors of the famed Eleventh Lost
Tribe, which was wiped out in the
last World War, formed their organ-
ization in a prison camp near Con-
stantinople; Exiled forever, with
“En Voyage" written on their
League of Nations passports, these
men pour into song all their hope-
less longing for their homeland.

The Don Cossacks are the voice
of Mother Russia; in their pre-
sentation of Russian sacred music is

revealed the exultant religious fer-
Ivor of the Russian, in their singing

of the haunting folk songs, the
dreary lcueliness of the peasant. and
in their wild war songs, accompa-

Hw inied by riotous shouts and frenzied

dancing, the barbaric spirit of the
