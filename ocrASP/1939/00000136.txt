“The fo/ee’s on Who?”

Funny, isn’t it, that all this discussion about the
Francello amendment hasn’t even brought mention
Of the underlying principle? The decision sought this
morning is not whether or not Mr. Francello’s
amendment will be approved. The question is—
Who is going to vote on Mr. Francello’s amend-
ment?

Inasmuch as our constitution states specifically
that payment of student tax is prerequisite to mem-
bership and voting in the Student association, it
is obvious that only those having paid this tax may
participate in the vote on the amendment. The
fact that non-taxpayers have been permitted to
vote is immaterial. Allowing them to vote was a
ﬂagrant violation of the constitution which, for the
sake of convenience, has been overlooked. Techni-
cally speaking, every amendment and resolution we
have ever passed is unconstitutional, unless the
official records show the margin of victory to be
greater than the number of non-taxpayers at the
time of voting.

 

 

Consequently, the Student association, student
council, or Myskania—whosever function it may he
——must devise a system that will bar non-taxpayers
from voting on this amendment. In all probability,
this morning’s concert will not leave time for the
amendment to be brought to a vote. The week
gained by this postponment can be well used in
formulating the required method. Then and only
then would discussion of the issue proper be per-
tinent.

Open Music Council

While listening to the State college symphony
orchestra during this morning's assembly, just
think for a moment how strange it is that so ver-
satile a group as this one is not represented on
Music council. The organization of such an orch-
estra is the greatest accomplishment of the last
decade in State’s musical history. Why has not
this accomplishment been given recognition in a
more material sense?

Too long have ‘poster-hanglng women’ been
rewarded for their ‘achicvemcnt’ by appointment
to council. True, the handbook emphasizes that
“promotions to council will be made on the basis
of interest and amount of work done ~— not on
musical ability.” But should musical ability bar
one’s promotion? How about opening the ‘closed
corporation’ that Is Music council and permitting

 

the orchestra to name its own representative?

good start; however, there's room for improvement,
especially in make-up (which is not up to this week's

and literary arts.

The Statesman Speaks

To the STATE COLLEGE News or Estate:

Be It known to the 5% of this college which still
blindly reads the News:
Whereas:

The Statesman never discontinued its policy of
presenting the News in its true light, as carried forth
from the Lion—and
Whereas:

The ignorance of the News Board is unquestioned~
Be it understood by all concerned:

'I‘hat Czechoslovakia didn't send an ultimatum to
Germany. and that by the same token the Slalcsman
board tools in no way bound to accept the whims of
its interiors, and that. the Statesman board has the

unquestioned right to at least participate in
the naming of place, time, program, and judges.
and that these things should be decided by

a conference or by popular olectlon of the
Student association. The Stalcsman board. there-
fore, demands that the prospective contest undergo
a rigid program of democrutlzlng, before its con-
sent be given to any such whim or fancy of the
directors of a minor college activity. And be it
expressly understood that by our reply to the original
ultimatum. negative as that reply may be. that the
Statesman board has placed the News Board In a
position of admitting. according to the converse of
their original statement which has by this action
become effective. that the following facts are true:

l. The News never was and never will be State's
greatest publication.

2. The Lion was good.

3. The Echo was better.

4. The combination could not help but be ex-
ccllent.

5. The Statesman is superb.

6. Sprague, Brown. and Agne. See a.

8. Any statements In the old Lion about the
News are absolutely true and may be quoted at
will.

that rushing is over for another

Quintet Opens

In Traditiolal Alumni Tilt

Dickson, Brauner, Havko to Fill Positions of '39 Graduates
As Untested State Team Faces Strong Old Guard;
Hersh, Bancroft to Lead Opposition

State college gets its first look at the 1939-40 edition of the varsity
basketball team tomorrow night when the Teachers open their thirteen-
game card in the traditional Alumni contest on the Page hall court.

will Open the season in the newly
acquired uniforms. Facing them
will be a powerful eleven-man ag-
gregation including ‘39‘5 ﬁve var-l
sity basketeers.
Offensive Strength

Looking over State's representa-
tives, signs point to a strong offen-
sive quintet with the team's defen-
sive strenth very much a question
mark. Co-captains Will Frament
and Walt Simmons, leading scorers
respectively last year, should be
throwing them in again. The form-
er is a consistent ton-poinL-per-
game men, good with both hands;
Simmons is a ball Of fire on his
hot nights.

Arnie Ellcrin in his infrequent
showings last year was always up
among scoring loaders. Fast, cool-
est man on the squad and possessor
of a fan left hand, Arnie should
shine. Bill Dickson and Hank
Brauner ran second and third as
'42's point makers and as they are
filling lllo shoes left by graduating
members, the attack should be as
potent as over.

Johnny flavko, a revelation as a
set shot with beautiful wrist action.
should garner his share of points.
Dcf‘cnsivcly. however. the loss of
Duke Hersh may prove to be a
great blow. Rarely among the scor-
ing loaders, Duke held the defense
together and was himself a great
guard. thlher new men can plug
tho gap is a question. Brauner. a
lower Of strength last year under
the buskcl.. may be the answer here.

Frosh Will Open
In Preliminary
To llirity Game

First-Yearmen Will Oppose
Troy Business College
In Inaugural Tilt

State's Frosh open their campaign
tomorrow night in the preliminary
contest to the Alumni game when
they face the quintet from Troy
Business college. The yearlings.
coached by Will Frament, are
primed to make their ﬁrst impres-
slot] on a critical State audience a
good one and have been working
out in long practice sessions for the
not few weeks. Play is scheduled
to start at 7:30 p. m.

Coach Confident

According to F‘ramcnt. "This team
is every bit as good as last Year‘s
Frosh outfit." ‘42's quintet, which
contributed so heavily to the var-
sity squad, was considered the best
first year team to play on Page
in years. SO the present yearling
outfit has a job out out for itself
if It is going to justify its coach's
confidence. The team is steeped
in reserves, something sorely lack-
ing on the trash squad during the
38-39 season. Frament considers the
last six men on his eleven-man
squad only a shade separated in
ability from his starting five and
intends to give the whole group a
good workout in this inaugural
game. Will also expects this out-
fit to go very “hot. and cold” which
will be in keeping with typical State
hoop squads. It is hoped the boys
are hbt Saturday night. and stay
that way.

Starting Lineup

The definite starting lineup
against the business college finds
Van Ellis at center, Regis Hammond
and Morris Gerber at the forward
posts, and Jim Portley and Harry
flora as guards. Howie Lynch, Bob
Wultcr, Art Flax. Tom Feency, Tom
Brier-ton. and Owen Bombard make

 

 

 

 

Merritt, Frank Kluge. and Bill Bur-
rctt. As usual, however, State tnl-
out seems to run in small quantities
with little in the way of reserve
strength.
Alumni Powerful

poor col'lditlon and lack of work as
a. unit. seem more powerful this
your. 1030’s flvo varsity men, Duke.

grcgntion along with Roger Bun-

Reorganization—1939 Style

Despite the present definite trend toward reform in the

student government here at State, there remain fifteen class
offices which are certainly not truly representative. These
Offices are class representative to MAA, and class representa-
tive and class manager on WAA.

The representatives and managers are elected by all
the members of the respective classes, regardless of the fact
that the officers on MAA council serve only the men in the
class, and that the officers on WAA council guard the interests
of only the women in the class.

be desirable (pullities——desirablc, that is, in a class manager
Similarly, women voting for men repre-
sentatives have no knowledge of the candidates’ actual qual-

formation as to the organization and its procedures.

Obviously, a fairer and more democratic system of repre-
sentation would ensue if MAA officers were elected by the ,
men of the class, who realize their qualifications and the prob-
lcms which they must administrate; and if the WAA officers
were elected by the women of the class, who appreciate the
responsibilities and demands of the offices to be filled.

ward to one of the hottest grad-
varslty tilts in years.

Jim Chapel], Alumni secretary of
MAA, in charge of recruiting Alumni
players, was kind enough to let us
browse through the pack of replies
he received—and there we found
some good stule

From down (or up?) Mahopac
way comes one of the most ominous
of the aforementioned rumblings, a
mlsslve from one Dick Marglson
who writes: "Tell coach that Duke
(Hersh) and I have been practicing
twice a week with the Peekskill
Armory Five and expect to be in
pretty good shape.” Sounds like a
threat, and a pretty well founded
threat at that. This duet might
lead the way for an upset tomor-
row night; at any rate Hersh and
iVIarglson will merit a careful eye-
ng.

“As for being prepared, I am
quite sure that I can hold up my
end" is the comment of George
Amyot. But George hastens to at-
atch a provision: “That Is, it you
don't ring in a bunch of old men
on us."

A coach from one of the major
high schools in northeastern New
York assures us that he will be on
deck for the opening whistle—Jerry
Amyot. Jerry, brother of “G” and
a familiar ﬁgure at Alumni games
is at present engaged as general
coach at Cohoes high. alma mamma
of the two boys.

Decidedly in the Alumni’s favor
will be the return of the active
warriors from last season, Torrens,
Hersh, Walko, Lehman, and Amyot.
This quintet scored 260 of the team’s
total of 510 points last year, slight-
ly more than half. Torrens writes
that he has been looking forward
eagerly to the game; We wonder
if they all haven't been smirkineg
counting the days!

We're not predicting the first
Alumni win in years —- still from
present indications the current issue
of the Alums will be far from a
pushover.
