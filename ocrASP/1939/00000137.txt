On Music, War, and Communism

Straight from a sell—out perform-

to a capacity crowd at Page hall
Tuesday night. As the ﬁnal strains
of the encore sung by the "human
symphony” died away, the audience

eighty pcr cent are still with the
chorus. Six replacements haVo been
made, being chosen from applicants
in vurfous European cities and from
refugees. Applicants are tested and
kept on record until there is a va-
annoy.

Sixteen of the thirty speak Eng—
lish fairly well, four of them speak-
ing the lunguug‘c pcl‘l'ccily. Serge

spanking for Jui‘ofl'. Bolotiuc was
willing to answer any questions put
to him except those concerning poll—
tics of Russia today. "We are ur—
tlsts, musical artists. We are not
politicians. The two do not mix."

The chorus today is practically
the some as appeared last year. One

in Germany when the war broke

‘soon as possible if they wore to get

said. "We lll‘O very sorry. We must
sympathize with the country who

to surrender.”

concerts or more than one 0. day.

State college audiences are not

l“Statesman Quiz
Proves Favorable

Students Want More Humor,
Return of Quotations,
More Material
Harriet Sprague and Marcia
Brown. seniors, co-cditors of the
Slatesmmt, revealed that the recent
poll conducted by the board found
the student body in favor of the
publication as a whole. There Were,
however, demands for a greater
proportion of humor in the future
issues. The next defect was in the
size of the issue; more of the same
material was requested by a great
number of the students. The fa-
mous page of quotations was
1missed by many who desired its

return.

The Statesman board also an—
nounces that the deadline for the
next issue has been set for Janu—
lury 5. All students who wish to

 

 

 

contribute must have their manu-
scripts in by that date. The stu-I
dent body is strongly urged to
,contribute material for the next
tissue if they are desirous of a larger,
imuguzinc with a more varied con—i
lent. I
The policy of the Statcsomn is;
not to retain the features of the'
Lion. and the Echo, but to put out
a publication entirely new in its.
make-up, style, and general char-I
uctoi'istics. l
The results of the poll as released I
by the bourd are: (1.) Do you like

RPI’S vast year-old court.

if Last year State lost its inaugural

game at Troy and then swept the
Engineers off their feet in the Page
hall contest. RPI followed its in-
itial victory over State with five
consecutive conquests on the home
floor while they could not record a
single victory on a foreign court.
Even Union, victor by twenty odd
points at Schenectady, fell on the
Troy court.
Hard Fought Battle

The modern State-RPI rivalry
dates to the 1934-35 season during
which time it has grown to be the
game of the year for the Hatﬁeld—
men. Prospects, past performances,
and other such factors can be dis—
carded when State meets this foe.
To quote Coach Hatﬁeld, “It's al-
ways a hard-fought battle" and he
expects this game to be no excep-
tion. A victory now over the
Cherry and White would be a big
ds a successful season.
Rivalry Strong

Because of the tradition and ﬁght
behind this rivalry, the team's
none~too—imp1'esslve play against
the Alumni should be no cause for
alarm. Real cause for optimism was
the stellar play of Hank Brauner

sity game. Hank looks like a big
part of the answer in ﬁlling the gap
left by graduation losses. The line-
up tomorrow night will probably be
the same as that which started and
played most of the way against the
Alumni. Brauner will be at center,
Ellerin and Frament at the for-

inforced by the strong frosh team
