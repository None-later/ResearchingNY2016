No Tax —- No Vote

Mr. F rancello‘s amendment comes up again to-
day after postponement from last Friday’s assem-
bly. From the lack of discussion about the
Campus concerning this legislation it seems that
there is either lack of interest or the complexity of
the issues involved makes a consideration too con-
fusing. Perhaps a discussion of the issues now will
serve to straighten out thinking on this matter.

Under the present system according to the
constitution or custom:

1. “All regularly enrolled students of New York
State College for Teachers . . . shall become mem—
bers of the association upon payment of the blanket

7!

 

 

 
  

   

 

tax.

2. Only holders of tax cards receive the bene-
fits from Student association activities and vote
in all association voting.

3. But non-holders of tax cards vote on reso-
lutions and amendments in student assembly.

4. The non-holders then participate in one
type of voting (viva voce) but not in the other
(elections).

If Mr. Francello‘s amendment is passed:

1. “All regularly enrolled undergraduate stu-
dents of New York State College for Teachers are
members of the association.”

2. Only holders of tax cards will receive the
benefits accruing from them.

3. All students vote in Student association
elections and on assembly resolutions.

The entire issue, then, as we see it, boils down
to a financial one.

There is no need for the passage of this amend-
ment. Any person who cannot meet the obligation
of payment of student tax can be excused from
doing so by presenting his case to Finance board.
All students who have not paid their tax, therefore,
become members of the Student association upon
the action of the Finance board, and all students,
therefore, can vote. Why, then, all the quibbling?
Moreover, if the illlll‘llfilllt‘lli is passed, those who
have not paid the tax, will have a voice in the
disbursement of Student association funds. is this
fair to those of us who have paid the tax? We
for one don't want our money spent by someone
who has no right to it.

Ovations to Orchestra

Bouquets again to the Symphony orchestral
[few words can parallel the enthusiastic reception
tendered them by the student body, Friday. Their
inspiring performance then, serves as an indica-
tion of what the future holds in store. We await
eagerly, Mr. I’erlman, for greater things. To you
and your musicians, we offer our undying praise.

STATE COLLEGE NEWS, DECEMBER 8, 1939

 

Whatis the Score?

 

 

It may be a bit superfluous but we’ve just got to
hand it to the State college Symphony orchestra.
For a group that started by borrowing music, im-
porting members, and sph'iting instruments away
from home, they most surely have come a long way.

After spending a pleasant assembly period listening
to the soothing Emperor’s Waltz and the exhilinrat-
ing Barber of Seville, it was certainly a let-down
to come to the Commons and get smacked with the
blaring. piercing, so-cailed swing “music” —- which
brings to mind the counter-part of swing—the scat-
terbrained, runaway terpischorian who insists upon
executing a haphazard polka on a crowded floor. If
bugs must Jitter, then let them do it with forethought.
Why don’t they ask the vic committee to push the
tables against the wall to make more room, or better
yet arrange to segregate themselves if they must carry '
on their catty capers? The Commons itself is no
refreshing roof garden. The ventilation t?) is ter-
rible, the jitterbugs perspire profusely, and the smoke ,.
hangs in thick clouds over the dancers. This is truly '

a modern Black Hole of Calcutta. Now that we‘re  
pouring forth our tirade, why doesn't the vic com-
mittee get some new records and try to get their
apparatus repaired? Some Of the “Wham” sessions
which come out of the loudspeakers remind us of ,
the Western front with the sorority circles as the ﬂiltest Smlles and

Maginot and Siegfried lines (never mind the pill- “Wiping the freShmEm

State college is taking on the aspect of a huge
melting pot which seems to be swallowing up commit-
tees very soon after they are formed. Can any of
you think back to the dim past and remember the
formation of a committee to investigate the possibility
of forming a second-hand book exchange at our own
State college? What could have happened to that
committee? This isn’t Russia so We still have free-
dom of speech. The possibility of a secret purge
is also absurd. We were all interested at the time the
committee was formed because everyone knows that
such an exchange will be very helpful to avoid the
inconveniences encountered just before each semester,
when the bulletin boards are cluttered up with the
posters and advertisements of each self-made sales-
man. Perhaps it will come out of hiding soon and
glVe us a report so that we will know just where we
stand in our hopes.

Another committee which has remained mute is
the social committee. After getting us all excited by Ding was
passing out a questionnaire in assembly one morning
we never heard from them again. Could it be that;
the poll on social activities at State revealed some-
thing too astounding to publicize? slon‘

To the editor:

Christmas vacation is practically here; and with
it the pro-holiday exuberance and the post-holiday
gloom. We have more than adequate time for a long
trip, greetings, and a long rest when we arrive home;
and the climax comes when we have to pack in a
rush. bid only half of our friends “adieu,” and de-
part in a flurry—after a New Year‘s eve carousel, a
very appropriate method of commencing the newl

remedies possible: (1.) extend the returning date to
January third; or (2.) reduce the pro-Christmas re-
cess by one day, and extend the post-Christmas vaca-
tion one day. In any case, the main Object is to be-
gin classes on January third, and not on the second.
It is only a matter of one day, more or less, and noth-
ing would really be lost by this addition of one day News
to the Christmas vacation. Isn’t it worth it?

Record Close Victory Over
Ramblers in First Win;

Grads Down RH

By winning two games last; Week,
KDR shot into a three way tie with
Potter club and College house for
the top spot in the intramural bas-
ketball league.

On Thursday evening, they eked
out a victory over Walt Danilwicz,
'40, captain of the Ramblers. He
scored eleven points in the ﬁrst half,
making the score 15-11 in the
Rambler‘s favor. But, during the

Isecond half he was held scoreless

by Herb Oksals, ‘41, of KDR. The
boys l'rom 366 Western. then, out-
scored the Ramblers to win 22-21.

The game was very hard fought
at all stages. With Danilwicz on
the floor. the Ramblers are a threat
to any team.

Grads Win

The other game of the evening
saw the Grads take Robin hall
20-12. Busacker of the losers was
high point maker with three ﬁeld
goals and two completed foul shots.
The Grads are not the aggregation

 

Though far from sparkling in'
their play, the Alums at least
showed some color in the vivid ar-
ray of suits in which they trooped
to the battleground. The spectrum
was well represented (much to the
dazzlemenl. of referees) plus one odd
shade which a fervant fan at our
side assured us was “cerise!”

All in all, it was a swashbuckling,
roly—poly affair, featured by Tor-
rens' display of some of the
tumbling prowess which made him
famous as an undergrad. The crowd
went wild at Frament's feat in
hurling a very much surprised Duke
Hersh completely over his shoulders.
Acrobatically the game was a big
success.

We were rather surprised to see;
the varsity clad in the conventional
hues after the nationwide radio an-
nouncement of a few weeks back
hailing 115 as wearers of the “green
and gold!" Kant, kauf! ’l‘he fellow
who said that no doubt has been
innocently running red lights all
his life.

There's a rather interesting tale
behind the sudden shortage of
varsity uniforms. TO quote the of-,
ficial cage rule book, rule ﬁve, sec—i
tion six: “Teams shall not use
anbcrs one (I) and two (2) int
numbering their players.” This is
to faciliute communication between
referees and scorers in calling fouls
and numbering free throws.

Up from the sports supply shopl
came the bundle of ’30-’40 suits!
Out tumbled shirts sporting,r thCI
forbidden numerals. Buck went
the bundle. An embarrassed con—I
corn is making amends.

In a complete reversal of form from
the previous game, Oksala heaved

State Splits Two
Hoop Encounters

Frosh Squad Hopes for Win
Over Troy Engineers
in Saturday Tilt

 

 

State's hoopsters opened their
1039-'4O court campaign Saturday by
splitting two home encounters. The
varsity repulsed the Alumni 38-27
after the fresh suffered a 38-19
lI'ouncing at the hands of Troy Busi-
ness college. The intercollegiate
season will be inaugurated tomorrow
night as both Purple and Gold ag—
gregations clash with RPI on the
Troy court.

RPI Encounter

State's freshman squads have cap—
tured only two of the seven games
with the RPI yearllngs. One of
these wins was chalked up by last
year‘s quintet and the other was
turned in by the 1936-37 outfit.

Nothing is known about the
strength of this year's Engineers,
but they can be expected to pro-
vide real competition for our 43'ers.
Despite last Saturday’s defeat, the
frosh hope to break into the win
column by turning back the Trojans.

Unimpressive Showing

The well oiled passing attack
which has characterized practice
sessions was conspicuous by its ab-
sauce in the clash with Troy Busi—
ness. The team looked as if it
belonged in a high school intra-
mural league. The offense bogged
down; the boys were erratic in their
passing and Shooting; and there was
no defense. Troy Business led 22-9
at half-time and coasted through
the ﬁnal half.

Butcher, Phillips, and Higgins, by
hanging up eleven, eight, and six
points respectively, outscored the
entire State team. Bora was the
best man on the floor and led the
Albanian‘s scoring attack ~— if it
could be termed an attack—with
six points. Feeney was close be-
hind, having two ﬁelds to his credit.

 

 

Varsin Play Ragged

In Alumni Conteslll

The varsity won its engagement.

Raggcdness
‘ The varsity dIsplnyed that com-
!mon early season symptom—ragged-
.ness. Poor teamwork and passing
accounted for the sluggish offense.
Mid-season form, however. was evi-
dent at the free throw line, with
the team converting two-thirds of
its foul shots. Topping the State
scorers and playing an all around
good game was manner with thir-
teen points. Frument followed with
ten tallies while the Alumni was
led by Hersh, George Bancroft and
Jerry Amyot with five. four and
t'our markers respectively.

Four Teams

The Alumni substituted freely
throughout the contest and utilized
four complete squads. This was in
striking contrast to the varsity's
use of but one substitute.

For fifteen minutes of the sec-
ond half, the Alumni kept its best
team on the floor and played the
home forces on chIi terms. At one
point, they cut, the winner’s lead
to seven points. Toward the end,
howowr. the varsity rallied to ﬁnish

good on the basketball court as she

Moreland hall's sextet became the

season by defeating the squad from

fast and accurate playing resulted
in the netting of the fourteen of

tional cooperation offered by Mary

sponsible for the win.

Up to the end of the ﬁrst half
