You know fellows—it’s
time you got wise to yourself! Af-
ter all, considering the men-women
ratio in State college, you should
be able to make some headway in
the field of higher “amour.” Any
males who are headed for a bliss-
ful year of romance need read no
further, but thOSe of you who have
woeful tales to tell—listen carefully.

I know it's tough, lad. You try
to be sweet to the gal, but she just
freezes up in front of you. Maybe
your big difficulty is that you don’t
live up to feminine expectations.
And now we come to the purpose
of this article. Four State "love-
lies," gazed dreamily into space
and gave Doris Blake's represen-
tative their opinion of “My Ideal
Man." These sketches are very
brief—but at least you'll get the
idea.

Alice Purcell. that KDR mas—
cot of '43, smiled coyly as she
said: “He must be a gentleman in
every sense of the word and never
wear bow ties or short pants (I
mean pants rolled up at the bot-
tom.) He must have lots of pep
and be able to tell good jokes. As
for dancing, he must be good—not
clumsy with the excuse that he has
his own original style. He must
be able to cope with various situa-
tions (censored)!" Other qualities
are: interest in sports, broad view—
point, serious (but with no inten-

“He looks just, as nice when he’s
awake for ten.minutes as he does
after ten hours (no remarks),
chirped Kay Wilson', ’42. “He
must be neat, but not foppish, in-
telligent, but not proud. Then
there’s the eternal problem of com-
mon interests. He must like good
poetry. dance well, swim and like
horses. Other factors are nice eyes
and hands, poise, confidence and—-
I hope—an interest in me and what
I’m doing."

And ‘now we come to Bea
Dower, that tandem-rider of ’41.
“My ideal man? Here's a list of
qualifications subject to change
without notice: anything but a sis-
sy or snob. strong (with shoul-
ders), easy to look at, gift of gab,
eyes that can do things, no ankle
braces or moustaches, good dancer
(with a grip), good dresser, any
color hair but gray. athletic. clean
fingernails, understanding. He can
boss me around in a nice way——
doesn't have to have money if he
knows how to how: fun—must be
able to act screwy. but know when
to be conventional. In short he
mustt be a man. not a mouse—or
a re .”

“When a girl reaches her senior
year in college, she is mature
enough to wonder if there is such
a creature as an ‘ideal man.’ I’ve
always thought that ideals are un-
attainable, and that's not a good
way for any man to be,” remarked
Rita Sullivan, ’40. “Perhaps
the best way to handle this is to say
what he doesn't have to be—he
doesn't have to be a football play-
er or a god from ‘Esqulre' with
an all-year-round tan. He doesn't
have to wear striped shirts or thick-
solcd shoes or have an old hat he’s
worn for years; he doesn’t have to
own a car. a ten-dollar-a-week al-
lowance, or a line—~but he does
have to be thoughtful, intelligent,
serious-minded in some things, in-
terested in people and things. I'd
like him to smoke a pipe, tell good
jokes or laugh at mine—and most
of all, I'd like him to be just some-
one I would always want to have
near me.”

And so fellows, this ends the first
lesson on “How to become some-
body’s Ideal Man."

Vic Dancing To Cost

Folks, there are only nine more
shopping days to Christmas. The
Yuletide spirit of giving is with

a .

So the Vic committee requests
that you extend the Christmas
spirit of charity to the neglected
Commons Vie. For the past three
months the committee has re-
ceived noon hour contributions of
but four cents per day. To make
up the deficiency in funds. the
committee is making a drive for
ﬁve cents per couple. beginning
this noon. (Ed. note—the women
are just as eligible as men).

There will be dancing today
from 1:30 to 4:00 o'clock this
afternoon. There will probably
be another swing session in
the Commons on the Wednesday
after vacation.

where stiltli‘lilh‘ are inclined to be
i‘lll'i'lCSS about lhclr spccch. and,
us it result. we see slovcnly enun-
ciulion. sloppy, inefficiciit sluri'ing
of vowcls. and dropping of conso-
nciils. Othcr defects are iiusality,
bi‘eulhincss. luck of i'orcc, and poor

‘phi'iising. whlch show cvidcnco of

carelessness and luck of case on
the part of the pupil.

The way to remedy this situation
in lhc high schools is to enlist the
old of the teacher. As Mr. Hardy
states in his article, "many of these
defects result from lack of atten-
lion and cure; every teacher can
help this circumstance materially
by paying attention to them and
by helping the student to take care.
The teacher can help the students
whose voices are week by demanding
clear speech, good phrasing, and a
full voice."
