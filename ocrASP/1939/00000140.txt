What Price a Name?

The junior and sophomore classes are now
planning for their annual social events, Prom and
Soiree, and are much concerned with the problem
of how much to spend for an orchestra. The debate
seems to revolve around the (Itlt'sfion--~l)oes a name
band justify the expense? We have some facts
that may throw some light on the matter.

lilxpcrience shows that to exceed the $400 limit
is to end up in the red. The class of 1939 was
first to find this out when they spent $500 on
its l’rom. Next year ’40 undertook a similar
sprcc, much to its I'cgrct, only to be followed
by a '41 splurge on Soiree. (In the other hand,
when ’40 set a $400 limit for its Soiree orchestra,
the total loss on all expense was $30m—a cheap price
for a swell entertainment.

The conclusion to be drawn is obvious. If the
orchestra fee for a name band is limited to $400,
not only will financial success be insured but there
will be thc attraction of the name band itself. After
all there are only a certain number who will attend
liit‘ function rcgardlcss of fccs, orchestra, place, or
time, but a good band may bring a larger crowd.

Puzzling Problems

 

Commentstater

(THE COMMENTSTATER is given the widest
latitude as author of this column, though the view-
points expressed do not necessarily reflect those of
the STATE COLLEGE News.)

I came to State with a fairly high Regent’s aver-
age. Since then, I’ve probed through the Verses of
Virgil. I’ve sweated in Prof. Hale’s Physics 21. And
I even struggled by Birchy’s combinations and per-
mutations.

But I can’t make head or tail out of the labyrinth
of rules whereby the innocent freshman woman be-
comes a soror. Pity the poor rushee.

She can’t walk with a soror after 5:00 o'clock.
Nor can she have a double date with a soror. She
never sees the interior of a sorority house unless
it's sanctioned by that grand old intersorority con-
stitutton.

I, a poor frater, protest against, not the idea of
sororities, but of its inane regulations. I cry out in
objection to sorority snickering because the fraternities
don’t have a silent period. I do not want an inter-
fraternity system as foolish and complicated as the
sororities l

While I'm knocking, I should speak of the common
practice of sorority girls rushing freshmen for this
or that fraternal group. It's “dirty” fin everyday
parlance). Nor should fraternity men show preference
for this or that sorority, as far as women‘s rushing
matters.

Group morals should outlaw it. since no organiza-

 

 

 

tion can. However, if this activity continues, let
no one kick. if his group suffers. "Turn about is fair
play."

III Ii III II

Last Friday, we postponed Mr. Franccllo‘s ideal-
istle amendment to the student body’s constitution.
Seine relevant material will soon be published by
Finance board. Every holder of a student tax card
will soon learn the benefits he obtains from it. No
matter, whether we should pay for the right to vote
or not, sonII ‘hing must be done.

If. ﬁnall vc, holders and non—holders of tax cards,
table the amendment, some provision should be formed
for exclusion of non-holders from voting in assembly
and even from participation. We must be consistent.

The Critic

The Don Cossack Chorus is a tribute to the musical
prowess of Serge Jai'ofl'. The virtuosity of this choral

 

 

A

group has overwhelmed audiences throughout the
world. We might comment that except for the basso

who was soloist in “The Kama Song." the soloists
possessed voices of ordinary quality. However. this
should bring even more. praise for Jarotl', who has
fakcn these men anti infused them with a spirit which
is clearly reflected in the high interpretative quality
of each selection on the program, The technical
equipment which Jaroff has drilled into the chorus
is beyond compare. Before hearing the Don Cos-
sacks', inflections such as they achieved would have
seemed possible only upon an organ. lndct-d,
chorus responded to .larofl"s hands as if it were an
organ, sensitive to every lotich and mood.

There are two matters which this column regrets.
Since our audience was composed of people from all

parts of the Capital district, it would have been
\l'lfwi‘ on .lai'otl“s part not to have repeated the
program which was given in Troy, Octobcr 4th. The I
second malfcr com-.ci'ns us at. State college more
directly. "The Snipe," a composition whose chief
merit was its i'cvclufion of the laughing powers of

Ile chorus. was received riotoust while "The Kama

Song." a deeply moving llllll\f' llussian folk-song was
lllf'l't‘l) l‘lltllll't'(l. The conclusion which may be drawn
from this» Incidcut is too pt'l‘flllf'lll lo hc glossch

State to Meet

Hamilton

During Christmas Recess

 

Team Still Seeks First Intercollegiate Win in Page Hall
Game; RP_I Scores Over Teachers at Troy Saturday;
Engineers Ahead by 24-12 at the Half

While State students are off on their Christmas vacations, the

varsity basketball team will extend

its stay in Albany until December

19 in order to meet Hamilton college in the third game of the
0

Teachers’ hoop season.

From all indications it seems that
State has an excellent chance of tak—
ing its first intercollegiate victory
of the present campaign in this
contest. The seventeen man Ham-
ilton squad numbers but three let-,
termen, these same three being the
only holdovers from the team thati
held State to a 42-40 victory last
year. Seven men have come up
from last year's freshmen team to
places on the varsity squad, and
as the State fresh had little trouble
against this same group last year
it would appear that the Clinton
team has been weakened since the
'38-'39 season.

Iloine Conn Advantage

Another point in State’s favor

 

and possibly a distinct advantage,
is the fact that. the game will be,
played on Page hall court. ThoscI

who saw the Hamilton gym last,‘
year knew well what the vai'sltyI
was up against.

On the darker side. the teachers.I
will have to hold in clich "Jackie’l

State’s fresh basketeers move over
to Albany Academy tonight where
they will play the Cadets in an at-
tempt to hang up their first victory
of the season. The men of ’43
have lost two games and will have
a very tough time in ekeing out
a win in this one.

Academy opened its season last
week against a strong Berkshire
team. The New Englanders were
sent back home with a 40-22 trounc-

‘ing tacked on their records. Frank

Malicney led the Cadet attack by
throwing in a total of 19 points.
He also proved to be a great defen-
sive bulwark. The Albany team is
captained by Carl Touhey. who also

OACH HATFIELD took a chance
last Saturday night at Troy
when he sent in a second string
squad of cagers as starters to “feel
out” the Engineers’ possibilities and

technique for the regulars.
It was a gamble based on sound

 

strategy, this use of a “feeler” team,
but the ’Tutxemen’s five gaVe it llttlel
chance to work as they loosed uni
early attack that shut out Hiltond
Lehman, Merritt, Dickson, and;
Kluge nine tallies to none.

All in all, however, the tilt was
far from a swamping for State and,
by no means proved the tremendous!
ItPI supremacy over the Purple and
Gold that the "rulers rooters like,
to boast of. Though State garnered
but twelve points in what remainedl
of the first half, the locals’ second;
twenty-minute offensive brought
them once within four counters of
the opposition as they outscored the
(‘herry and White 16-10.

Considering the handicaps under
which our outfit worked, including,

 

 

 

the mammoth RPI court and thel01 , ,

glossy—surfaced white ball, they didl
surprisingly well after warming up:

CH, Ramblers Win

Intramural Tilts

Monday night two poorly con-
tested games marked the only activ-
ity in the intramural basketball
league as the Ramblers won from

,Avalon-Spencer 37—21, and College
house ccntinued its victory march

by defeating Kappa Beta 37-9.

The first game was a repetition
‘ every other Rambler contest——
versus the other team.
In the second contest. the Celi-

Ollt.‘ of the SLIILUSIIICII trekking into“ if?” “mule. quintet went on n scor-
the 8011] after the trip from Troy “lg 5mm 1” the third quarter ‘0

summed up the situation nicely‘
when he remarked: “You know, if;
they played crossways on that courtI
it Woulda been a big help!" I
fl‘IiERE seems to be a great deal‘

of discussion concerning the 1111-}
timeliness of the Hamilton and Mc-
Gill contests.

In the case of Hamilton, the fault
rests far from athletic management.
Since schedules are necessarily
planned well in advance, the current
listing was worked up on the basis
of the college calendar issued last

year, marking December 20 as the-

beginning' of Christmas vacation.
Originally set for one day before
the start of recess. the Hamilton
tilt became. hopelessly buried in va-
cation \I’Ilf'll the new calendar
shoved closing time ahead four
days.

With McGiil. the game had to be
taken when offered or not at all,
since the Canadians will be on the

 

road in this vicinity at that time
only. ‘

State to Engage
Colgate in Chess

Statecmen Defeated Raiders
in Both of Last Year’s
Tough Matches

State’s undefeated chess squad is
looking for its third straight victory
Saturday when it meets a strong
Colgate squad at 7:30 o’clock in the
Lounge.

This year Colgate is bringing a
team strengthened by several prom-
ising freshmen to try to avenge the
two defeats inﬂicted on it by the
State aggregation last year.

To oppose them, State will have
on deck Art Fox, Steve Shaw, John
Hoose, Jim Gilien, Roy Sommers,
Bob Patton, Henry Kraatz, and Bill
Weyant. The team will welcome
spectators at the match, and there
will be opportunity afterward to dis-
cuss the games with the players.

At last week's Chess club meeting,
Art Fox played nine opponents sim-
ultaneously and showed his ability
by winning seven, tying two and
only losing one to Al Burden of the
Civil Service Chess club of Albany.

The other members of the team
are playing simultaneous exhibi-
tions each Week at Chess club meet-
ings. Chess players of the college
may enter these exhibitions.

While on this trip to the Capital
district. the Red Raiders will also
clash with chess squads from Union
and RPI.
