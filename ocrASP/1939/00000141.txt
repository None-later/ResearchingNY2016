\ STATE COLLEGE NEWS, DECEMBER 15, 1939

News Questionaire Ferrets Out
Untold Secrets of Student Body

 

The STATE COLLEGE News broke
through the thin veneer of student
modesty Friday and a serious erup-
tion of startling true confessions
took place. A preliminary examin-
ation of the laughable lava which
oozed into the Activities office
brought to light the following
chunks of frank philosophy.

The following are descriptions of
State men: “Less said the better,”
“Mostly ‘drips’,” “Very nice but
many are too rough,” “A bit too
effeminate." state women did not
escape, however, and met with: “As
dates—make good teachers," “Hot
and cold," “Generally acceptable—
figuratively speaking" and “Four
typeHmart (stooges), beautiful
(and too smart), dumb (still beau-
tiful) and dumber."

ing individual admitted that they

In answer to “How many times
do you date ‘a week,” one girl
stated, “I’ve never dated a week."
Another said “Seven times a week
and when he comes to see me."

One person’s favorite dance bands
are: “My own, my brother’s, and
my uncle‘s." Two frank and fear-
less souls stated that marriage in
college would depend on conditions
and another tragically confessed
that she “Wouldn’t even be here
if my boy friend could support a
wife." One girl said that she pre-
ferred a church.

“Wish me luck for tonight,” was
the plaintive request of one young
gentleman to “kissing on the ﬁrst
date.”

“Are you in love at present"
brought down such replies as, “I’ll
ask her" and “Tragically.” One

one, while another said he didn't
“have a wife to strike.” This ques-
tion, “Would you strike your wife,"
also brought the cynical reply “Is
she any better than my mother?”
