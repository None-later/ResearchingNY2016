Kirkpatrick Well Known

Mr. Kirkpatrick is a well known

until his college days at Harvard,
after the harpsichord had been ob-
tained, did he begin his career. He
perfected a technique of his own
and before he was graduated from
Harvard he. was able to give a con-
cert. His talent was soon recog-
nized and he travelled and studied
in France and Germany after be—
ing awarded the Paine Travelling
Fellowship in Music.

Since that time, Mr. Kirkpatrick
has given concerts throughout the
United States and Europe. and in
1937, when he was awarded the
Guggenheim Fellowship, he return-
ed for more study.

 

Mr. Kirkpatrick. beside prescntr

hig‘ numerous concerts, has also

State ’3 Stronger Sex Present
Qualifications for Ideal Co-Ed

Here ll is. it'iuiid two. Following
the old adage. "'l‘urii about is lair
play." the men of State now give
their opinions on what the Ideal
Girl of State should possess. First
on the program is Max Sykes, '40:
"b‘hc must have a nice figure, be
small enough so that. my arms can
fit around her, steer clear of jit-
terbuggin' and have personality a
la carte, No premium on looks,
must be cooperative, and have the
skin yoii love to touch. She should
give a little attention to her escort
and provide a good incentive for
leaving a warm house. In short an
1090 lass with a 1940 model will do
the trick."

Bob Agile, '41, gives his viewpoint
which follows: "She must not dance
at all. be free of Jitter cooties, and
not Wear spiked heels. She must
look Well in dark glasses but not
wear them; no painting fingernails
and be capable of fighting back."

Charles Quinn, ’41: “She must be
a blond, talkative. pleasingly plump
with a little oomph, personable dis-
position. and cooperative. She must
not be jittcrbuggish. or goody—goody.
She must be a good dancer and
ready for good. clean, fun. I'd like
a girl with whom I can have a good
time, not a nice time."

Len Kowalsky, the cdltor-in-c——-
feels that, “nature's preparation is
the most satisfactory. She must
have jitterability and no excess of

 

:i\oirdupois because it will make her
pei'spire and that would tend to
(llilll|)cll iriciidsliips. She should
have a highly adjusted neuro-mus—
cular system and an excellent sense
of humor although she does not
necessarily have to laugh at my
jokes. Her biggest meal should
be breakfast."
Some of the

lilOl'C COIISCI‘VlLLlVC

males said: Frank Kluge, “Why wor- ,
t whether they have paid their stu—‘

ry, this is leap year ain‘t it?" Larry
Halog‘, “She‘s got to have that look
in her eye, nuttin’ else." Willard
Frament. "She shouldn't be an ex-
tcremist, especially in dancing."

Robert “Moe” Stevens, of the
thundering herd, says, “I like 'em
very tall and inasmuch I'm a gentle-
man i prefer blinds. I mean blondes.
Looks are not really necessary but
a. pleasing disposition is essential.
The girl must be a good dancer with
a cooperatiVe nature at the right
moments. The athletic type is pre-
ferable but I absolutely will not
accept a Jitterbug because tall people
look like loose-jointed. runaway an-
telopes, galloping around a dance
floor. She can but she shouldn't
smoke. drink, or swear, just to put
up a big front."

So here’s the set-up girls. the men
have spoken. but the echoes will
linger on. However, we still main-
tain that, "When a girl begins to
wear high heels she gets a different
slant on life."

announced that this morning‘s as-
sembly will be a business meeting.

lrom the Soeial Committee, and the
introduction of several motions.

According to a motion passed at
the last meeting of the student. body
on December 15, Mr. Francello's
amendment will be the first order
oi business. This amendment pro-
poses to strike oiil Article 111, which
reads as follows:

“.\l| ri-gilliirly enrolled students of
\I‘\\ \Ill'lt Stiili- ('oltege for 'l‘eitclrors
.iiid tIII_\ specinl slutlelllH of this college
shall become members of “NH iiHsocliI-
lion upon |It|,\ll|l'lll of the llllllllit'l lil\."
and substitute in its place the fol-
lowing :uiiendment:

".\ll regularly enrolled uriilcrgriulu-
:ili- hlllllt‘lllh oi' Veil \ol'li Hliilc ('ollege
Ior 'l‘i-iii-liers nl'i- llll‘lllllt'l‘H u'l' Illlh llhhll-
cinlion."

’i‘his is the third tliiie that Ml".
lv‘ruiicelio's resolution has been
brought up in the student iisseiiibly.
'l‘wlci» before it has been postponed
because it was believed that there
was not enough tilnc for the delib-
eration that the measure required.
According to Mr. Francello, the only
change that the new amendment
would bring would be the rigllt to
to all students regardless of

Fran Riani. ’41, and Bill Dickson,
’42, co-chairmen of the event, agree
that the dance will be “a swell
chance for students to sow their wild
oats.”

Rustic Theme

Decorations will follow a barnyard
theme that will make Old MacDon-

penthouse. Rumor has it that the
,ianitors may even contribute saw
“horses” for atmosphere (’9).

Aside from dancing, the program
will subsidize several concessions de-
signed to arouse your sporting blood.

"cornicst" dresser at the shindig,
but no one with shoes on will be
kept out. For those "potato-hoers,”
who are susceptible to the “contin-
ental” angle. the Monte Carlo effect
will be lcnt by a “penny-pitching"
game, The hungry buinpkin and his
belie may appease their palates on
