A Friend in Need

Too often we hear of the ill-feeling that exists
among fraternities at State; too seldom do we find
acknowledgment of “good will among meant—State
men. This past week saw a friendly gesture among
fraternal organizations that deserves considerable
recognition. May we call attention to the prompt-
ness with which all fraternities and group organiza-
tions extended the privileges of their houses to a
fraternity whose house was temporarily uninhabit—
able. Along with the usual resolutions, renewed
energy, and sense of anticipation, the New Year
at State seems to have come in with a commendable

STEPHEN

 

 

spirit of cooperation.

The recent poll conducted by the NEWS indi-
cated that a large percentage of students was def-
initely against the existence of fraternities and so-
rorities, primarily because of the antagonism they
fostered. Many have referred to them as a neces—
sary evil, I'naintaincd only for the purpose of stim-
ulating a collegiate spirit. And yet, despite thcsc
criticisms, here is a concrete example of the good
fellowship that supposedly does not cxist. Per-
haps it is a good omen!

But if this friendliness is present beneath the
surface, why should it find expression only at a
time of need? Why not bring it out in the opcn in
other ordinary, cvcry-(lay ways? if the New Year
could bring forth a resolution like this, State Would
be a better place to live in, and fricmlships would
be broadened. So let's resolve to make the spirit
of 1940 a coopcrativc interiratcrnity spirit. thcs-
sity shows that it (an in: done!

Curriculum Committee

—- Commentstater

(THE COMMENTSTATER is given the widest
latitude as author of this column, though the view-
points expressed do not necessarily reflect those of
the STATE COLLEGE News.)

Resolved: To have a faculty-student curriculum
committee set up during the spring term of 1940. In
several of the most recent publications of the Na-
tional Student Federation of America, to which State
college belongs, there appeared several articles re-
garding student-faculty curriculum committees which
should prove to be interesting for State students, es-
pecially specialists in the teaching field.

The curriculum in any college or university should
supply student needs, lay the foundation for future
life and train the students for democracy. Even
in a professional institution such as ours, there is a
definite need for courses which meet student needs,
such as courses in marriage and family relations,
honor courses or seminars for exceptional students,
courses in democracy, and a course on the culture of
minorities of our own country. As we keep pace with
new ideas and practices in the educational field. so
should we keep pace with the changing needs of the
students in the college.

Value of New Courses

Since the college exists for the students (even
future teachers), it seems logical that they ought
to have a voice in making curriculum recommenda—
tions which, they feel, would be valuable to them in
their lives over and above those professional courses
which are required by their major field.

In the same N.S.F.A. bulletin are two practical
suggestions: First, that a permanent student curricu-
lum committee of not less than 3 nor more than 5
members appointed by the student council, should be
set up. Contact between this student curriculum com—
mittee and the faculty curriculum committee should
be made at periodic meetings of a joint committee
throughout the school year. Secondly, there should
be established a permanent joint committee of facul-
ty and students to study curriculum changes through-
out the year and to recommend changes at the close
of the school year for the following term. In the
spring an open forum session of both faculty and stu—
dents should be conducted for the purpose of sub-

 

 

 

or changes that should be made.
Recommendations
Some recommendations from such a committee are
suggested below:
1. Establishment of marriage and family rela-
tions courses.
2. A marking system of pass-fall rather than
grades, with a record of marks kept in the
Dean‘s office to be referred to only in cases of
recommendation.

.Lifting of load of required courses for fresh-
men and sophomores.

.System of comprehensive examinations in the
major field.

. Reading period before final examinations.

. Inclusion of vocational guidance in the fresh—
man orientation program to help and advise
freshmen about what to do in the world's work.

The purpose of such a committee, therefore, is

to respond to the needs of the student body for a

curriculum that is more varied and that best meets

the needs of most of the students.

Among other things falling un-
der the hackneyed simile “as old as
the hills.” is the school spirit theme
which characterizes the work of so
many editors who can't think of
anything else to write.

A few months back we Slipped in
a clamor for student support of the
cross country team which had for
so long run its collective head off
with no one from the college look-
ing on.

Though we're not claiming to have

penned more significant material
since then, we've avoided school
spirit. In fear of falling over back-

ward, a communique rushed to us
shortly before press time has con—
vinced us that the Slena game to-
night, a contest that will in all
probability mark the start of a keen
rivalry, merits a “support your team"
outburst.

Accordingly We present. Cheer—
leader Gardephc's message in full:

“(lur college rivalry with Sicna
starts Friday night, I hope.

“I‘m calling a. pep meeting for
3:30 Friday afternoon in the gym.
It’s about time we got a little spirit,
a little organization, a little con-
certed support for our team.

four games thus far this season and
were beaten quite decisively by Al—
bany Business College. A probable
Itartlng lineup for the Loudonville
boys includes Delaney, Whalen, Lon-
go. Pennock, and Coughlin. Coach
Framcnt will probably start Port-
ley. Bora, Gerber, Bombard, and
Ellis.

On December 15, the State frosh
squad played what was probably
its best game of the season thus
far against Albany Academy, though
losing 40-31. Against the highly rated
Cadet quintet, the Green and White
fought a brilliant uphill battle all
the way. and the outcome was not
assured until the final moments of
the contest.

The game resolved itself into a
battle between Gerber and Ma-
honey. Academy star. These two
wcrc deadlocde at the finish with
scvcn field goals and two free throws
tor totals of sixteen points apiece.
Captain 'I‘ouhey. with eight tallies,
and Plunket and Gabriels with seven
Eapiece provided the margin of vic-
. tory.

 

 

Despite some fine guarding by ' A-at the barn dance
Bombard and Fcency, Mahoney was ; goesll

all over the floor. When Academy
took the ball it was Mahoney who
‘lled the fast—breaking offensive and
. scored.

The same story applies well to
.(‘icrbcr who constantly lcd the
‘State frosh attack, with an excel—
llcnt eye for the hoop. Given the
warm» support as that received by

Snow Sports
With the coming of snow and ap-
parently a fairly long period of cold
weather, the snow sports are en-
joying a boom. Washington park
lake is littered with skaters, and
the skllers and tobagganers will un-
doubtedly be making trips to the
hinterlands to clutter up the tough-
est slopes they can find. . . . Trackll

Skidmore
The play day mentioned some
time ago in this record has really
amounted to something. Instead of
being a three-way play day as ten-
tatively planned, it has boiled down
to a purely non-competitive event
between State and Skidmore wo-
men. to take place on Saturday,
January 13 here.
Shouts and Whispers
Now that we've almost reached
the halfway mark in this year’s
activities, State students are com-
ing out of a self imposed come to
show a little bit of school spirit-—
at least our cheering squad hopes
so. The pep rally scheduled for
this afternoon will indicate whether
we will cheer wildly at the Siena
[and subsequent) games, or whether
we will sit calmly and admire the
grotesque ants-in-the-pants antics
of the cheerleaders. Ah, pour le
sport, mes anus—and remember,
everything sports.
Sport you, sport your new beau,
sport your new clothes,—just sport

win two out of three in order to
gain the five rivalry points.
