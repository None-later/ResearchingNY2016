State Has Representatives
at Syracuse, Columbus
and Washington

State college faculty members were
Well distributed throughout the eas-
tern states during the Christmas
recess. The principal’s conference
at Syracuse, the annual meeting of
the American Historical Society at
Washington, D. C., and the “Parlia-
ment of Sciences” at Columbus,
Ohio were all attended by various
members of our faculty.

Dr. Robert W. Frederick, prin-
cipal of the Milne school, Dr. J.
Allan Hicks, professor of guidance,
Dr. C. C. Smith, assistant professor
of education, Mr. Paul G. Bulger,
secretary of the student employment
bureau, and Mr. Warren I. Dens-
more, supervisor of English, repre-
sented State at the fifty-fifth an-

‘Queen Mary’ At KDR
Committed To Drydock

The boys from Western ave-
nue came home last Monday to
receive a very frigid welcome at
their house. It seems that the
“Queen Mary” (the furnaCe un-
der camouflage) had been sab-
otaged during the farewell blow-
out which took place there last
December 14—and 15th.

An emergency housing problem
was immediately solved when the
other fraternities cooperated to
give shelter. It is rumored that
some of the lads even managed
to secure room in a sorority
house (lucky them?). However
with delicate salvaging operation
on a scale similar to the raising
of the Squalus. the "Queen Mary”
was soon put in a seaworthy con-
dition again. .

plan because it provides time for
recuperation after the trip.

The trip started at 11:00 o’clock
the day before vacation. The
group arrived shortly after 2:00
o'clock and attended a lecture given
by Miss Mabel Williams, supervi-

tor of “Books for Young People."

Saturday afternoon, all day Sun-
