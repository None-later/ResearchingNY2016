Orchestra To Perform
At Plays On Tuesday

The string ensemble of the
symphony orchestra will perform
during the intermissions of the
Elementary Dramatics plays on
Tuesday. This is the first of
what promises to be a long and
faithful association between the
orchestra and the various organ-
izations of the school.

The orchestra will be directed
by Merrill Walrath, ’41, who is
making his debut as an assistant
conductor. Bernard Perlman,
’42, announces that the orches-
tra is interested in cultivating
conductorial talent in the college.
In the future, all capable ap-
plicants will be given opportu—
nities to conduct both rehearsals
and concerts.

To~the Editor of the STATE Cosmos
News:

In harmony with the practice of
the day, We students of State col-
lege have been experimenting with
self-government. Is this self-gov-
ernment genuine? The late Presi-
dent Brubacher seemed to think so.
In an address to the student
body, he commented on the growth
of the student association, saying
that the administration would make
no attempt to curtail the work of
the student body provided it kept
within its own sphere (i.e., in mat-
ters pertaining solely to the students
themselves).

I am wondering if the administra—
tion did not transgress this prece-
dent when it ruled that students
who failed to pay taxes and class
dues, would not be recommended

 

Chances for a bigger lead for the
class of ’42 look very good at this
time because the sophomore women
found the freshman banner Wed-
nesday.

monium reigned in the hall outside

for a teaching position.

In the first place, who willed that
there should be a student tax, class,
etc. Was it not a creation of the
students themselves? Does it not
follow then, that those who made
such a ruling should be the ones to
deal with problems arising out of it.
And would it not have been more
logical if the administration had
recommended its ruling and the
student body adopted or rejected it?

Last year the student body passed
a resolution requiring the payment
of class dues in one lump sum at the
beginning of the Freshman year.
And so as the situation now stands,
you have two bodies legislating
over the same thing (which is con-
fusing to say the least).

Aside from the question of juris-
diction, this ruling is unjust, work-
ing undue hardships on many upper-
classmen. When a student could
not pay a tax he realized he
would be ostracized from all activ-
ities (voting, athletics, etc), but
he had no idea that the future
would demand him to pay up back
taxes. In other words he is being
penalized twofold through no fault
of his own. Is this fair?

If such a ruling has to be made, it
should take effect at the time it was
passed and not date back several
years. In United States government
such a law is called an ex post facto
law and is strictly forbidden by the
Constitution.

Dear Editor:

As I understand it, music is con-
sidered among the “arts.” We have
a DramatiCs and Arts association
which sponsors performers in every
artistic field except music, These
performers, so far as I can find out,
haVe been procured entirely from
sources outside the college. We also
have a Music association which
sponsors, among other things, one
musical performance by outside
talent, as well as several concerts
by various musical organizations
within the college.

On the basis of these facts, I
suggest:

I. That Dramatics and Arts asso-
ciation have as its purpose the
presentation of worthwhile figures
in various fields of art, including
music, from professional sources
outside State college.

2. That Music association devote
its activities to the promotion and
presentation of musical talent with-
in State college. With the recent
establishment of a student sym-
phony orchestra, the possibility for
Music association to insure its cul—
tural influence is increased at least
two-fold. Thus Music association
could become a truly musical group,
not merely a clerical body for the
purpose of procuring artists of
various degrees of virtuosity to pre-
sent before the Student association.

land; and President and Mrs. John
M, Sayles.

Lloyd Kelly, president of the Stu-
dent association, has stated that the
rest of the assembly will be de-
voted to voting for the Pedagogue
“mosts” and to the announcement

Students Defeat

(Continued from page 1, column 1)
regardless of tax-paying status. An
appeal to his ruling was denied by
the Student association.

Kelly announced the ﬁnal vote as
442 affirmative, 276 negative, 318 not
voting. In response to an inquiry
concerning the margin necessary
for passage of an amendment, he
ruled that'bnly a majority of those
voting was required. This was im-
mediately challenged by Murray
who insisted that a majority of
the association had to approve.

Instead of appealing Kelly's rul-
ing to the Student association, Mur-
ray pointed out that the question
involved an interpretation of the
constitution. He demanded that the
ruling be referred to the judicial
body of the association, Myskania.
The decision handed down by Mys-
kania reversed Kelly’s interpreta—
tion. The judicial body's decision
was based on Article XI of the con-
stitution which reads: “This consti-
tution and its by-laWS may be
amended by a majority vote of the
association. . . . "

As a result, passage of the Fran-
cello Amendment during the 1939-
1940 session is virtually an impos-
sibility. Rules of order prohibit
the re-introduction of any rejected
measure during the session in which
it was defeated. The only other
avenue is to force reconsideration.
This can be accomplished only after
a resolution to reconsider is intro-
duced by a student who voted with
the negative on the amendment, and
a majority approval of such action
is secured.

Still in doubt is the method of
voting to be employed. According to
the constitution, only regularly en-
rolled and special students of the

to believe that the present bunch

 

can turn the trick. However, if our
outfit can be inspired to play the
type of ball it played against Siena,
coupled with the fact that there
is a “nothing to lose, everything to
gain" situation present, we may very
well hold the Falls team to a close
contest.
Won Five, Lost Onc

Niagara so far has won five and
lost one, although it has not yet
plunged into the heavy part of its

schedule. Easy victories have been
recorded over Toronto and St.
Mary's (Mich) while stiffer com—

petition was encountered in knock-
ing over Fredonia, Western Ontario,
and St. Mary's (Minn). The team's
only loss so far was at the hands of
a strong John Carroll of Cleveland
outfit.

Strong Sophs

Niagara is led by co-captains Mike
Vignola and Frank Kearney, the
former having scored eight points
against State in last year’s game.
Steve Slabak. Henry Campbell and
Dan DeSantis are the other mem-
bers of the squad which faced State
a year ago. The men who ran the
score up against us in 1939 are all
gone. Up from the standout frosh
aggregation, however, are eight men,
among them one Nick Grunzweig, a
mere six-foot-five bail player and
Don McInerney only six—foot-three.
All told, Niagara will have thirteen
six-footers.

With it all, there's a sneaking
suspicion that this Niagara quintet
will not be much better than Siena.
It will pick off better, be better
coached—Mr. Gallagher's teams al-
ways arc—but all—around, it should
not rate lnuch over the Loudon-
villc team. The iatter‘s topnotch,
performance against St. Bonaven-i
iurc on its Lllll‘Cl successive night of,
play is good enough indication of;
that. St. Bonnie almost always l'llti‘s,

Siena Swamps Statesman
As Smooth Passwork
Riddles Defense

State's Frosh team will be gunning
for sweet revenge when they meet
:he Albany academy quintet on the
Page hall court tonight at 7:30
o'clock.

A month ago, the green-and-
white combination lost a thrill-
ing battle to the Cadets by a score
of 40-31. Since then, the Academy
boys have defeated the RPI frosh
in a very close game by the score
21-20. Here, there is a chance for
comparison, since the Statesmen lost
to RPI, 38-31. However, the Teach-
ers have the advantage of being on
a familiar court. This may be
enough to turn the tide and bring
a long—sought victory to the frosh.

Probable Lineups

Academy's lineup will probably
include: Mahoney, Gabriels, Plun-

Lead State’s Attack
Before Record Crowd

Last Friday night, just about the
largest audience that has packed
Page hall in many a day was trest-
ed to what was undoubtedly one of
the greatest games ever played on
that floor. The tremendous crowd,
in a bedlam from start to finish.
watched State suffer a 52-45 defeat
at the hands of an excellent Siena
team in a contest replete with good
shot-making, good floor play, and
enough fight for five games.

State's play definitely hit its peak
of the present season against the
strong Loudonville outfit but the
team was up against a club a bit
superior in everything but fight.
Ellerin had a great night as he
clicked with beautiful lefty hook
shots and threw in 14 points while
Frament followed with his 11 tallies,
although out on personals early in
the fourth quarter. Howie Tucker,
Siena's much acclaimed scoring ace
made 15 points mostly from mid-
court to nullify much of Havko's
excellent guarding. Free tthS {1150
played a great part in deciding the
contest. State. with a terrible 11
out of 27 record from the foul line
could have made a great bid for
victory with a better percentage.

Siena went off to an early lead
with Crummey leading the way, but
State came back furl to tie it up.
From there, the victr‘rs held a slight
edge until their late first half
splurge made it 28-19. Three quick
points for the home team put. the
count at 28-22 at half time. Fra-
lncnt continued his phenomenal foul
shooting as he threw in all 5 of his
fouls in the first half. His total in
two games (Hamilton and Siena)
went to 15 out of 16, a rarity on any
team. Led by Ellerin, Frament, and
Havko, the home force rallied in
great style to tie the game up and
then pushed out to a 37-35 lead at
the third quarter mark. With Fra-
ment and Brauner out on personals,
the team was unable to withstand
Siena’s surge during the final ses-
sion as the visitors turned on the
heat.

When it was all over and the
smoke had cleared from the field
of battle the crowd was ready for
smelling salts.

J. R. M.

Had we known that our drastic
departure from convention last week
in the form of our blaring “Best
Stem!" bend would have had such
a. fur-reschlng inﬂuence, we'd have
gladly modiﬁed it to ﬁt the gym.
The proverbislly hard-packed ssr-
dlnes were so free as penguins on
the Sahara In contrast to the tre-
mendous crowd that jammed Pogo
hall at last Friday's game.

Honest, we won't do it again, be-
cause even we had to sweat through
the affair with a. pair of bony Siena
patelles poked squarely between our
shoulder blades. And you who were
there know how that feels.

Seriously, though, it was the big-
gest crowd we’ve seen in our two-
snd-a-hslf basketball seasons. And
it goes further than that with Chief
nngineer Hunt reporting it to be
the largest since he has been here.
Coach Hatﬁeld, pinned down to
numbers, estimated a gate of from
1,200 to 1,500.

It was a good game. There's no
use panning the boys for losing
to a college without a senior class,
because the Loudonville outfit is
beyond all shadow of doubt a nicely
working combination. Frankly, we
feared defeat by a greater margin.

Ovcr last week-end, the Green
and Gold split two after the State
game. falling in a close tilt to the
St. Bonnics and swamplng the same
Niagara. of Rochester outﬁt that
beat them before. 60-38. Tucker, in
all three week-end frays collected
46 points. Says Roy Shudt of
'I‘uckcr in his Troy Record sports
column:

“And you're going to see in Howie
Tucker, shooting ace of the Slena
quint, a lad who'll be ripe for the
American (professional basketball)
League when he graduates."

Apparently the Siena boys were
as scared of Framcnt with his 22
point Hamilton game spree as our
outﬁt was of Tucker. Close guard-
ing of Will led to three successive
fouls early in the game. Will, in-
cidentally. exhibited his usual eagle
eye from the foul line in sinking at
three for State’s ﬁrst scoring.

Congrats to the cheerleading de-
partment for some good new stuff.
Barring intervention by the Dies
committee, the new “Sieg Hell" yell
has definite possibilities. We un-
derstand that the cheermakers
have whipped up some equally novel
howls for tonight‘s Niagara game.

As to the frosh game. the new
llorn's note was appropriate.

The second Siena-Stute contest
has been cancelled dlle to Siena‘s
inability to get a gym for that night.
Still. (:ull'i arrangements be made
for another night? We'd like to
are more of the Golden Warriors.

Mid-Season Totaling Show:

Dsnilwicz Tops League;
Tuttle is Second

The triple tie for the ﬁrst place

in the men's intramural basketball
league was broken last Thursday
when College House toppled Potter
Club in a closely contested overtime
game 30-29.

Robin Hall, continuing their

series of upsets where they left
of! in the football league, best the
Frosh last Thursday and KB lost
Tluesdsy to jump from last to fourth
p ace.

CH-EEP 'rlmuer
From a spectator’s standpoint the

College House-Potter Club contest

was a thriller. The score stood
at 13-13 at the intermission. Both
teams battled evenly through the
second half until a CH surge (mak-
ing the score 23-18 with a minute
to play) seemingly had brought vic-
tory to the Central avenue team.
But for the second successive con-
test, Potter came back to tally ﬁve
points and tie the score. Carney
dropped two from the center during
the extra. period. while Tuttle’s suc-
cessful foul throw provided the vic-
tory margin.

The other game saw Robin Hall
take the Frosh 24-19. Busacker and

Gryswacz tallied 8 points each for
the winners, while Reed scored the
same for the Frosh.
Grads Win

Monday night the Grads made the
winning column, beating the com-
bined teams of Avalon and Spencer
halls 26-20. Bud Tyler of the losers
hit the hoop for seven points.

Kappa Delta Rho's near loss
to a fighting Frosh squad, 18-11, was
a distinct surprise. For one of the
favorites, the winners must have
had an off night. Oksala found
the basket for eight counters.

Tuesday the Ramblers snatched
a victory from the Sigma Lambda
Sigma outfit which led at half time
16-12. With Danilwicz and Day
tossing in ﬁeld goals during the
second half, the Ironmen won 29-
25. Danilwicz and Day made four-
teen and ten points respectively.

Robin Hall took the second game,
26-15, from Kappa Beta. Peppard

first half, scoring ten points. Kappa
