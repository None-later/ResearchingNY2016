"at $85. 00 for Norse

On December 15 a resolution was introduced in
our assembly to the effect that “the Student asso—
ciation appropriate $85.00 for the establishment of
a permanent Public Address system.“ When ques-
tioned, the committee introducing the resolution said
that $85.00 was a sufficient sum of money to install
an address system adequate for the needs of the
college. The assembly, accepting the report of th:
committee, fmally appropriated the money from
the surplus funds of the association. As a result
of this action, the system was installed and initiated

 
  

    

 

 

      
   
   
    
       
  

  
  
   
   
   
   

  
  

before exams.

We have had an adequate length of time to judge
the usefullness of the new system. There is but.
one speaker to supply the Commons with dance
music. if the average student will stop and re-
member the old system with two speakers and the

, present system with but one speaker, he will realize
 i that he has less music and more noise. it would
E seem that an address system adequate for the needs
of the Commons would require at least three speak-
ers to supply danceable music and less noise. The
Annex, too, has a speaker—wwhich has so much
volume that one gets a headache listening to it.

There is our new public. address system—77 far
from adequate speakers and volume in the Com-
mons— «far too much volume in the Annex. ls the
Student asxociation going to continue making up—
propriations for dance music ~tlll‘owing good money

 Hello/4 Week

lluring the past week we have been subjected to
the rigors of llcll wcck physically and mentally.
One could not walk down the corridor without col-
liding with frcsluncn IIcophylcs draped in clothes
\vorn backwards and walking backwards down the
ball.

This year the fraternities have carried so much
"hell" to the ucopbytcs that our liberal faculty has

had to enter complaints against lllclu. It Would

 

seem to the casual observer that by the time the

they would havr- passed the stage of adolescence
which requires them to strive for rI-roguitiou by out ,
ragcous exhibitions. I
III most colleges the fraternity public hell wet-k 
has become old-fashioned and mttmoded. it is mod»
era to hold the rigors of hell week within the bounds
of the fraternity house. When will the State col~
lege fraternities become modern and relieve the men-
tal hazards frqu the larger ntnnber of the student ,

College Life

 

__ Commentstater

(THE COMMENTSTATER is given the widest
latitude as author of this column, though the view-
points expressed do not necessarily reflect those of
the STATE COLLEGE NEWS.)

One of the greatest values of a college education
is the interchange of experiences with one's fellow
students. These experiences can only come about
when one is in close contact with other students, with
fraternity brothers, or with sorority sisters. Housing
on this campus is inadequate in one respect: namely,
that: a large portion of the men are living by them-
selves or in groups of two’s and three's, and are not
gaining the valuable experience that living away from
home should give to a student who is on his “own”
for, perhaps, the first: time in his youthful career. The
function Of a college should be that of broadening
the student, expanding his tastes and interests. and
enlarging ills social contacts. TO become a well-
adjusted member in society, one must share the ex-
pptriences which only a wide variety of contacts can
0 er.

 

 

I’oor Contacts

This commentstater is addressed, primarily, to those
men who do not live at a fraternity house. cooperative
group house, or at home. Most; of these men, it; should
be realized, earn a good portion of their college ex-
penses by outside work of some kind. Frequently. it
is impossible for them to come to college functions
such as dances. plays. lectures, athletic games. and
the like. Their only contact with college life is the
daily routine of classes and some more classes. and
then study, which is often done half-heartedly. At
the end of the year, the student realizes. a bit too
late. that; he has missed an integral part of college
life by not participating in a portion of the under-

, graduate functions which make college life congenial

and livable. "All work and no play makes Jack dull.‘

One solution to the problem would be to organlz.
the men into a group for themselves. A tentative
plan such as suggested below would help in the early
organization of these fellows. Early in the second
semester. even right now. they should conduct a meet-
ing for the purpose Of selecting it group of men to
run their affairs for the following year. At this time,
a house manager should be selected, preferably a
junior. and any other officers which may be neces-
sary. The group should then look for a house suit-
able for the members who desire to cooperate. After
obtaining the house and equipment. it will be neces-
sary to unify the follows in such a way as to gain
the goodwill. confidence. and respect of the entire
group for the new enterprise.

Group liouses Needed

Definitely. the solution to the problem is not in
the formation of another large residence hall because
these students havo insufficient funds to live at such
a place. What is needed is a house or a group of
houses, worked on a cooperative plan which would
keep living expenses at a minimum and college life
and spirit at a maximum. Furthermore such groups
would have actual business experience because they
would come face to face with actual problems of main-
taining and establishing themselves in the college
society. So, why not start right now. Become part of

the college conmnmlty, part of its ‘lfc. its thoughts. and

its actions. 7 7
The Critic

Beginning Thursday, January 23, Margaret Mit—
chell’s story of the old South “(lo-no With the Wind,"
has been shown continuously, three times a day. in
Albany's theaters.

The super-production of Selznlck International
combines the most modern form of entcrtnlmnent.. the
technicolor motion picture, with all the chivalry. grace,
and beauty of the pro-war South and pathos of the
Civil war.

Of all the outstanding performances in the epic.
the portrayal of Scarlett O‘Hara by Vivien Leigh is
perhaps the most muazlng. Miss Leigh. the English
girl who traded a British accent for u southern drnwl.
was as beautiful and vivacious as Miss- Mitchell could
ever have dreamed her. Her performance may well
win for her the coveted Academy award.

Clark Gable us lthett Butler. the debonair block-
ndc runner. outdld his many splendid screen perform-
nuces. in the role of a social non-conformlst who
strove to make Scarlett love him and to win the
respect of others, (table’s naturulness and cleverness

the picture.

III the supporting roles, noteworthy are the coil—
trlbutlons of Olivia dc lluvtlund (Melanie Iinmlltoni,
Ilnttie McDaniel ISL-III'lct.t.'s negro "MIIIIIIIIy"l, and
Leslie liowurd IAslIley Wilkesr. However, Leslie
iiowurd was. i think. slightly nus-cast. ills British
accent did not help to put conviction into his role
as it southern gentleman.

 

'i‘he llltmt outstanding of the supporting cast was

undoubtedly linttie McDaniel who appeared in a
majority of the scenes of the production. iier physi—
cal nppcnruncc combined with her portrayal of u lov-
ing. scolding, coII:,cletItio1uI negro slave make up u

essential of the supporting players.

Ollvln do iiuvllund us Melanie lituutlton. the kind,
loving wife of Ashley Wilkes, again proves her ability
to completely win the heart of her audience in a
purely sympathetic role.

The amazing length of the picture tit. runs three
and one-half hours) is primarily due to the faithful
adherence of the photo-play to the book. Its detail
and lengthy scenes are. howuvcr, definitely an asset,
and the picture holds interest all the way through.

‘Hellenics

 

 

 

A HELLenic Heliweek seems to be
the main order of business on the
Greek social scene this week since
two of the fraternities and nearly
all Of the sororities are in the process
of showing their respective pledges
exactly where to get off—and what
to put; on while doing it.

The Potter pledges are getting a
new slant on life—in fact, they
don't seem to know whether they're
coming or going. The climax of their
little tortures will come tonight, we
hear. Ah—assume the angle! (Who
said that?) Tomorrow night the
surviviors will be initiated formally
into the fraternity at; Keeler’s res-
taurant.

Kappa Beta's neophytes are also
contributing to the general wel-
fare and amusement of the student;
body this week. and tonight at mid-
night marks thelr zero hour. Ar—
rangements for the affair are un-
der the able direction Of Green-
span and Pearson. Tomorrow night;
the KB's are conducting a vlc party
with Hermie Kleinc as chairman,
and a formal initiation ceremony
Monday completes their weekend;

KDR's week of fun for their
pledges is still an event Of the fu-I
Lure, but that's not stopping them
from collaborating the terpslchora
can abilities of their thirteen pledges ,
with KD's thirteen in a community
dancing class. A vic party for mem-
bers tonight and another for pledges
tomorrow night fill up their social
calendar this weekend. A recent
dinner guest at KDR was Mr. Robert
Vail. fraternity brother from Cor-
11011. class of '14, who is the new
State librarian.
