Statesmen Face 
Vermont Tonight '

(in Page Floor.

Meet Burlington Five After,j
Long Layoff; Visitors
Having Poor Year

 

 

I

State swings back into action af-,l
ter a two week layoff tonight when
it engages the University of Vermont
on the Page hall floor. The Hatfield 3
men will be endeavoring to even'
up the won and lost standing. 

The State fans who follow the
hoop 'game closely know that Ver-;
mont usually rates high on thei
court. as victories over Dartmouth—i
heading for its third straight EIA
title~last year and the year before
will testify. However, a glance at.
the Burlington club's record seems
to indicate that the Sabo coached
outfit is going through a disastrous
campaign.

Early Losses

Three early season losses,
the hands of Dartmouth and one
by Fordham, were no sign of what
was to come—especially consider-l
ing the calibre of the opponents;
and the fact that two of thengames
were close. Yet, since hitting the
“easy” part of its schedule the Ver-‘
montcrs llill'i' found the going very'
tough. Norwich. American Inter-i
national. and St. Mike‘s were all vic-f
torious-~the latter in the more re-j
cent of We meetings—. i

Powerful Tufts and Springfield,
two of New England’s stronger teams ,
were also winners. Only McGill,1
and Middlcbury have been on the
short end of the score and the Ca-
nadians had them in trouble all
the way. Having seen McGill herep
that speaks for itself. The three point ;
loss against Springfield several days
ago is the most optimistic sign that
Vermont has had as Springfiech
is having a great season. In fact.!
it might be the first sign of a late
season surge.

Briefly. State fans shouldn't have
to see another “Niagara” it the
home team is to win the game. This
isn’t installing the Teachers as the
favorite but a little basketball —
not what we’ve seen recently—will
insure a close game.

Probable Starters
Coach’s free use of reserves on
the NY trip probably means that
he will ease up on the Ironman
stuff. Dickson and Hilton have
demonstrated that they can fill
in capably. so there seems no excuse

Show Grabs Top S pot
In City Chess Tourney

Steve Shaw, ’40, leaped into
first place in the Albany city
chess tournament by winning
three successive games within
the last week. Shaw has now won
seven games without any losses.

His nearest opponent, Max
Pavey. ex-champion of Scotland,
has won five and lost none. An-
other State man. Art Fox, ’42, is
among the leaders with a score
of two wins and one tie. The
other State entrants in the tour-
nament, John House, '41, Saul
Ikler, grad, Henry Kratz, ’42, and
James Gillen, '42, have found the
tournament too stiff and are all
in the lower division.

Each man in thetournament,
which is being sponsored by the
Albany YMCA. will play each of
the other nineteen entrants once.

Green and White to Meet
Delhi Aggies Tonight
on Home Court

 

 

State's freshman team swings;
back into action tonight on the Page .
hall court as it meets the Aggies of l
Delhi in the first of a home-and-g’
home series. i

The Delhi boys have so far shown}
very little power in losing all of
their first five encounters. Albany
Business college has inflicted two of
these defeats on the Aggies, both by
very decisive scores. The other
losses were caused by St. Lawrence
frosh, New Paltz Normal, and the
Canton Aggies. The Delhi offense
is apparently very anemic since
their average score per game is only
about 25 points. On the other hand,
the opponents have averaged be-
tween 35 and 40 points. which ShOWS
a definite lack of defense.

State Power?

The statesmen have quite often
shown brilliant spurts of form which
illustrate that, if the team starts to
click. it will be tough to beat. How-
ever, for the most part. the fresh
show a weak attack, depending
mainly upon individual scoring.
Several bright spots have shown up;

It is with the deepest regret that
we tighten our literary ('2) belt this
week to wedge into the spacious
niche which our generous brothers.
the advertising department, so kind-
ly left us up in this corner.

However, We mustn’t let It appear
that full responsibility for the great
loss rests solely on the already-
burdencd shoulders of the advertis-
ing staff. More directly, dear read-
or. we ask you to consider us as
martyrs to the budget-Slashers.

We really had a lot to say. We
wanted to conduct a poll on the re-
cent suggestion that this column’s
name be changed to halibut or fillet
mignon of sole for the duration of
Lent . . . a host of things.

If you feel that your week has
been made incomplete by our virtual
omission. if you want to see this de-
partment returned to its one-time
glory, arise faithful sportsmeni . . .
deluge the responsible authorities
with bitter notes of protest!

Troy showed a superior team in de-

from that past encounter, the Tro-

What About “BUSINESS”?

Today 7 out of every 10 men and women gainfully employed in New

York State are in “business.” This great field includes all the branches

of commerce—as opposed to the professions.

Teaching is a profession for which a large percentage of the students
at State are admirably suited by nature and by training.
