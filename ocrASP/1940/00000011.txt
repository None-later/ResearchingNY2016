VOL. XXIV, No. 17

 

1942 Will Have
magi/h: Party

Non-Date Policy to Prevail
at Leap Year Social
Tonight at Eight

The sophomore class, in accord-
ance with the plans formulated in
the last class meeting, will con-
duct its annual class party tonight
in the Commons of Hawley hall,
from 8:00 until 12:00 o’clock, un-
der the general chairmanship of
Margot Duren, '42.

As was announced in the News
last week, the party will run along
a leap-year theme which means
that for this evening the female
majority of the class will take over
the social initiative. Paul Merritt,
president of the class of 1942, has
requested that in view of the fact
that a two to one ratio of girls
to boys exists in the class no one
secure "dates" for the party.

Miss Duren has announced that
Roy Sommers, '42, “playwright” of
the sophomore class, has created
a skit for entertainment to reflect
the inversion of social procedure
theme. However, trouble has arisen
because several prospective female
thespians have balked after read-
ing the script. The last word, as
we go to press, is that Dorothea Mc-
Isaac and Harry Jordon have been
conscripted for the leading roles.
The program of entertainment will
be filled out by several types of
games such as chockch and darts
and various forms of novelty dances
such as the "broom" dance. Decora-
tions will also follow the "fourth
year" idea just how, has not yet
been divulged.

Merritt says that because of the
wonderful class spirit so far shown
by the class of '42, he expects thci

affair to be the best of its kind
this year.
Those in charge of the several

committees chosen are: arrange-
ments, Alfred Stiller; refreshments,
Ruth Vincent; and music. Robert
Mock.

Perreiz Addresses
Forum of Politics

Edgar Pcri'ctz. ‘40. spoke at the
last meeting of the Forum of Poli-
tics concerning the American Youth
congress which he and Mary Jane
MacNamai‘u. '40. attended two weeks
ago as representative of SCA. Miss
MacNamara was also scheduled to
speak to the forum, but was unable
to attend the meeting.

The purpose of the congress con-
ducted in Washington, as stated by
Pcrretz, was to discuss the follow-
ing: employment, and all its prob-
lems; civil liberties, and possibilities
of maintaining peace.

William McCracken, ’40, intro-
duccd two resolutions to find out
the sentiment of the forum members
on two current problems.

The resolutions are as follows:
1. “Resolved: That the Forum of

Politics unconditionally dc—
nouncc the invasion of Finland
by the USSR."

2. “Resolved: That the Forum of
Politics favor the policy of oi’i‘i-
ciul loans and credits to Finland
‘i‘or purposes including the pur-
chase of airplanes and muni-
Lions' by the government of the
U S.”

Tlicsc resolutions

were sent to
committics for study. '

went over, but surely. Was Eld-
ridge good? He was better! And
the new queen—ah. the queen (sigh).

At exactly 11:30 o’clock, tall, state-
ly Queen Beatrice Ann Dower, of the
House of Honey, ascended the throne
and received the crown of empire
from Her Majesty, Jane I, who
wielded the sceptre over the junior
class last year. Then the populace
cheered, applauded, and marched to
be reviewed by the Queen who was
attended by Princesses Knowles,
POWell, Nowell, and Scesny.

After the pompous “Pomp and
Circumstance.” and the grand march,
Eldridge and his boys proceeded
to swing out in a manner which
Justified his reputation as a show-
man as well as a master swingster.
In true plumber style he swung the
low notes and he swung the high
notes—and then he swung! He
even put the class treasurer in a

do that must be good. He kept his
band going full swing except for the‘

Seniors to Open
Dormitory Drive

Walter Harper. ‘40, president of
the senior class. has appointed
Janice Friedman and Joseph Mc—
Keon. seniors, as co-chairmcn of
the 1940 housing drive for funds'
to secure a ciormitory for the monI
of State college. i

Each member of the class will be
approached by one of the drive cap-
tains for a pledge. in past
years the majority of pledges have
been for $100. but according tol
McKcon. “We are aiming at a 100%]
pledging of the class of 1940 as:
well as $100 pledges." Subscriptions
may be paid in the manner most
convenient to the pledgor.

The financial goal has been set
at $200,000 since 1936, when the
first pledges were taken up, and has
been kept in a separate savings ac-
count. The goal as far as the build—
ing is concerned is to have the cor-
nerstone laid by the year 1944. which
will mark the centennial of the col—
lege.

The building will house 134 men
on three floors. The facade will
be similar to the present dormitory
for girls, with minor changes. The
entrance to the mezzanine floor will
be on the Partridge street level
facing that street.

These plans are tentative, and it
should be remembered that they
are subject to change as expediency
may require.
