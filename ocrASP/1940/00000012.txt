Of course there is absolutely no need for a
minimum of noise in the activities office! No
one wants to work on the various activities located
in this office— let them do their work in the Com—
mons. Who wants to work for an activity any-
way? In State college there is no need for extra-
curricular acl.ivitics~—thcrc.is no interest in them
“there is no place for them in our preparation
for the teaching profession.

We are firmly of the opinion that extra cur-
ricular activities of State are a farce and no one
should b.- allowcd to work in the activities offict'
—«it is a waste of time. We should contintlc to

We don't have winter carnivals. We don't have
both Glenn Gray and Tommy Dorsey for Junior
Prom. We don’t have football teams that crash the
front page of the Times Union or the Knickerbocker
News. We don't have football teams, period. We
don’t have the eyes of the nation turned on us every
June at Poughkeepsie. But, have you ever stopped
to think how well the student body stands behind
the extra-class activities we do have? Let's take
a gander about the campus.

We have a Women’s Athletic association that is
strong enough to conceive the idea of a sleigh ride,
plan for, advertise and have the sleigh ride all on
the same day, with almost fifty girls present.

We have 8. Men’s Athletic association that can
plan and sponsor an intramural basketball program
whicn has aroused an interest among its partici-
pants, almost equal in intensity to that shown in
the inter-collegiate program.

ﬁle have a Student Christian association that has
five active commissions. each of which averages a
meeting every two weeks. We have Music and Dra— l
matic and Art councils which attract many more
freshmen each year than can be of service, so that
it has become necessary to set tip a stringent try-
out program.

We have a college newspaper which had over
sixty student reporters this fall. We have a debate
group with so many active members, that, in spite
of a heavy schedule, most of them will have only
one opportunity to participate in a debate.

What is the cause of this extraordinary enthusiasm
for outside activities? We should like to believe it
lies in the intrinsic interest in such matters of the
individual student, but in all honesty we must admit
that such is not the case. The cause lies rather in
the fact that long experience in the field. of teacher'-
training has shown that a few extra-class activities
look pretty good on a senior's appointment folder,
and consequently the student body, as a whole, has
come to value this phase of this training.

\Vell, marks are out. The first semester has be-
come another unfinished but closed chapter in the
book of our education. Ideally, we would have time
to pick up the loose ends and go on to develop, to
some extent, the interesting phases of our past
courses. But that, of course, is impossible in the
present system of steamroller education; for, once
again, we're being introduced to new subject material
so rapidly that we can hardly assimilate it, without
taking time to do unrequired study.

The Critic A}

In the days when the colored people were still
enslaved, they would often gather together and
pour out their troubles in spontaneously originated
"spirituals." ’l‘hcse spiritual songs of the negro
served as a solace from their oppression, and also l
drcw them closer together in their worship of God.
Many of them show the lively imagination of thcl
negro and the musical nature that is seemingly in- 
herent in him, and of these a great many have pass-

 

 

of Louis Armstrong and Ella li‘itzgcrald. Just ill
between these two extremes is the spiritual singing I
of the Southcl'naircs Male quartet.

tuals in Dr. 'l‘ommy's folk literature classes. and for

the fact that State will have its
hands full. The Winooski Park
team also boasts wins over St. An—
selm's and Norwich, but has fallen
before tough St. Lawrence and
Springfield teams and Clarkson
Tech. The real tipoff on St. Mike
was their loss by a narrow margin
at. the hands of Sicna. The club
State took last year by 40-36 is
almost all gone, but capable rc—
placcments have been found.

Last week‘s loss to Vermont can
be attributed to the visitors' zone
(it-fensc. Offcnsively State was
bottled up and only good shot-mak-

On the othcr hand the victors cap-

break that State couldn't stop.

Loss To Delhi

There is not much to be said about
the game with Delhi last week.
Five men were forced to carry the
burden against the green and white.
Both teams were ragged in their
pass—work, and not very good on
defense. Hansen led the States-
men with '7 points. He was closely
followed by Flax and Hammond
with 3 field goals apiece. Feeney
and Born each contributed 4 tallies.

Every Delhi player scored with
Burley having 4 fields and 1 foul
shot for a total of 9 points. The
Aggies sifted through a. sieve-like
frosh defense repeatedly, but they
were unable to run up their score.

Next Saturday night, the team of
'43 will play its last scheduled game
of the current season when it; meets
the yearlings of RPI on the Page
hall court.
