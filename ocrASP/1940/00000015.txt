Seniors

For Proposed Dorm Plan

Preference

 

Sayles Outlines His Plans;
1940 Shows Opposition
to Field House

DISCUSS PRACTICALITY

DriVe Captains to Approach
Classmates for Pledge
to Building Fund

Those members of the senior
class who attended the Dorm drive
meeting in the Ingle room Monday
night went on record as being in
favor of a combination recreation
center and dormitory. The meet-
ing was called to clarify the objects
of the Dorm drive.

The approximately fifty seniors
present almost unanimously agreed
that the dormitory would have no
ill—effects upon fraternities, sorori-
ties, and group houses as they exist
today. The session lasted from 8:15
to 11:15 o’clock.

Dr. Snyles, acting president. out-
lined his plan. The seniors respond-
ed with questions on the dormitory.
The practicality of a field house
was thoroughly discussed. A con-
siderable portion of those present
expressed their opposition to the
building of a field house without
a dormitory. The concensus of
opinion was that further investiga-
tion of finances was required be-
fore anything furlher would be done.
No satisfactory plan was advanced
for the upkeep of such a building.

Field House

The field house as proposed would
consist of a gymnasium, bowling ul-
leys. recreation center. and showers.
Dr. Sayles expressed his doubt of the
possibility of a loan to build a field
house which had no ostensible means
of self-support. Tho discussion re-
volved around the field house and
the purpose for which the money
is to be spent.

Tho drive started Tuesday morn-
ing. According to Janice Friedman,
‘40. co-chairnurn of the drive. there
will bo no compulsion to pledge.
ll will bo cnlircly personal. Each
senior will be approached by n cup-

Banquet Comes Early

The banquet this year is pur-
posely being conducted much earlier
than it was last. year. Last year,
lhe senior class had its banquet
tho. night before Moving-up Day
and encountered a number of dif-
ficulties. The banquet conflicted
with the junior banquet which is
traditionally conducted on that
night. The difficulty of having the
sumo spcakcrs also arose and since

 

May has always been the month of
banquets. the seniors have set theirs
for Tuesday, March 19.
