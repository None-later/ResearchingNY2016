Senior Citizens

Monday evening there was a senior meeting
in the [ugle room. The purpose of this meeting was
to discuss the pros and cons of the men’s dormitory
drive. Approximately fifty seniors turned out for
the meeting. This means that out Of the 283 mem-
bers of the senior class, 233 knew all there was to
know about the dorm drive. Therefore, these 2.33
seniors are behind the drive 100% and are willing
to Sign their pledges as soon as they are contacted
by the drive captains.

We feel sure that this year’s seniors should
make excellent secondary school teachers. They
are extremely interested in where their hard-carde
money is going to be spent. They are the citizens
of tomorrow—they have the power to educate the
minds of the younger generation. With such civic
minded citizens of tomorrow, we entrust the com-
ing generation—and we pity those poor adolescents
who will have such wonderful leaders" help.

Good luck to the drive captainsll

D6»A Recalling?

 

Commentstater

(THE COMMENTSTATER is given the widest
latitude as author of this column, though the view-
points cwpressed do not necessarily reflect those of
the STATE COLLEGE News.)

With a ans editorial clamoring for the “opening”
of Music council. and a resolution pending in Student
association reorganizing that; “closed corporation,”
comes new of a trend being established voluntarily
by Dramaties and Arts council. Enmeshed in sorority

 

 

politics to the point of strangulation, D and A council .
has finally realized the inevitable—that it must either ‘

reorganize or disintegrate. The council plans to scrap
its antiquated constitution and adopt a new election
system.

In carrying out such a reorganization, council
members, knowing full Well "what the score is," have
diagnosed their own shortcomings and formulated
what could be a workable solution.

Outstanding weakneSS in past years has been that
the selection of members must be made on Moving-up
day from the freshman class. Obviously, the only
sound basis for judgment is active participation in
what one generally associates with the dramatics and
arts. Inasmuch as such participation occurs chiefly
in the sophomore and junior year, N0 freshman can
qualify for election.

As it; now stands, Dramatics and Arts council is
an executive body. Personality, executive ability,
popularity. and sorority affiliation have prompted past
appointments. Ability on interest in the dramatics
and arts must become essential requisites for selec—
tion. Newly appointed representatives would require
approval of both faculty sponsors. This should elim-
inate “hand-picking.”

The new election system might well be patterned
after the method now employed by Debate council.
This would mean the selection of three representa—
tives from the junior class to serve two years and
one member of the senior class to serve one year.

Paramount in the minds of D and A's constitution
revisers must be a determination to remove present
“barriers” to representation of the stronger sex. It
has been eight years since a man has been even so
much as considered for election to council. This
condition may be attributed to the now famous “vicious
cycle." Knowing appointment to be an impossibility,
men have failed to try out. Having no men to con-
sider and looking for none, council has been consist-
ently appointing women. “The dishonors were even.”

The next few weeks will reveal whether or not all
this is but idle talk. If action is taken by Dramatics
and Arts council, well and good. If not, the associa—
tion will inevitably be reorganized by resolutions from
the floor of the assembly. It is desirable that all
reorganizations come from within, but. if not, it must
and will come from without.

II! it! It it it it

Recent assemblies have demonstrated that the
wheels of our democracy are grinding very slow. One
cannot imagine the speed at which they will turn
when the budget hits the floor. If past experience
is worth anything, it presagcs a hectic meeting.
Already rumors of budget difficulties are perplexing
our committees and boards. Last year, two meetings
were required to adopt our budget. Since then we
have felt a reduction by fifty taxpayers and a 20%
budget cut. A cut of fifty more taxpayers this sum-
mer IsecIIIs likely. All of which makes passage of the
budget in a single meeting virtually an impossibility.

The solution is to consider the budget earlier, pre-
ferably on May 3. Introduction of the budget on the
third means plenty of time for discussion and investi-
gation before acceptance on the twenty-fourth. It also
means that Studan assoriation elections must be
begun as soon as constitutionally permissible. Which
will relieve that last minute rush in May. Mr. Kelly
and Student council would be wise to schedule May
3 as Budget day.

9% [/15 CHI/r lid

After seeing last week's plays and those of the
week before, it seems to Us the first bit of business
is to congratulate the. Advanced DraIIIatlcs group
on its steady flow of exceedingly good productions.
Their presentations these past few weeks have been
the exception to the general rule that the second
semester plays do not; measure up to those of the first
term.

In the first play we liked Louise De Angells, cs-
pccially her quieter moments and the deep. dull
quality of her voice that enabled her to reveal so
vividly the soul of that peasant woman. In one or
two places, perhaps she rounded her emotional peaks,
but her climax, the knife episode, was packed with
power. You could feel the silence in the audience.
George Kunz fitted into our idea of a typical lnn-
keeper quite nicely. We liked the accent that flavored
all his conversation. Vince Miller's accent; was not
as consistent as that of’ Kunz, but his comedy mo-
ments were excellent. I-lowovor the actor that de-
servos special connncndatlon. is liyman Mcltz. Al-
though ho was on the stage for quite a while with
comparatively little to say, he attracted your atten-
tion. and seemed completely real.

The second play was cute. We admit it's a trite
word, but it was just that, cute. The novelty of the
play, as well as the light, airy mood which was sus-
tained throughout. made it a hit with the audience.
Top honors go to Loretta Servatlus for her capable
handling of an extremely difficult. part, a monologue
part in a play that was essentially pantomlne. Bar-
bara Ferree and Murch Scovell caught the light-
hearted splrft of young lOVe and got it across to the
audience thru action alone. Anne Rottray as the hard,
blusterfng villain was convincing too.

To Bob Hertel and Irene Pager, the student di-
rectors, congratulations on two very fine productions.

- ' J.R. M.

Saturday night saw the finis
written to a mediocre State cage
season—but it was a finls that set
us wondering why the season hit
the mediocre low that the final
figures show. We were a bit; stun-
ned after the Niagara game. Mc-
Gill fooled us, too. But. we were
positively electrified by the per-
formance the boys put on the other
night in sinking the Engineers fif-
teen points under.

Personally we doubted very much
that the old home court charm
would work again for State, what
with RPI boasting a season of only
two losses prior to the tragic trip
to Page last Saturday. But it all

cast about threats never to bring
another team to Page.

As early as the week before the
game did the 'Tutemen have the
excuse for their downfall whipped
up. Said sports editor Herman
Zowader of the Renssclaer Poly-
technic in summing up the State-
RPI situation:

“It is the size of their court that
has made the Purple and Gold
nearly invincible (have we been?)
at home. Their shellaeking at the

Iglgst antest of Year

‘Strong First Half Attack'

Gives Team Easy Win;
Merritt ls High

State brought its regular varsity.
basketball season to a successful
conclusion last Saturday night by
easily defeating RPI 48-33. In so
doing. the Teachers finished the
present campaign with five victories
in twelve starts.

The game was almost identical to
last year's home court victory. State
could do little wrong in the first
half as it held a 24-10 lead at
the intermission. In the closing
periods, the Teachers sported only
when the “Cherry and White" made
its infrequent rallies. Paul Merritt's
12 tallies led State's well divided
point total. For RPI, German
played well and Joe Madden scored
ten points during the second half.

Sophomores Start

Conch Hatfield surprised at ca-
pacity crowd by starting four soph-
omores, Dickson, Merritt, Brauner,
and Hilton along with Simmons.
Playing heads-up. fast, aggressive
ball, this quintet pushed off to an
carly‘9-4 lead and then played the
visitors right. off the floor to win
going away. For most of the game
the starting five, plus Will Frament
and Arnie Ellcrin, saw all the ac-
tion, and gave State fans plenty
to cheer about. It was the first
time this season
corded a winning performance with-

 

hands of the ’Tutemen last Decem-
ber may also be attributed to their
small court. One theory maintains
that when they suddenly found
themselves playing on such a per-
fect court (RI’l's) they were com—
pletely overcome with their luck
and didn't recover till the game
was over."

He goes on to remark that the
’87 gym is one of the most perfect
courts in the cast, while “it’s pretty
difficult to believe that Page hall
even measures up to the minimum
standards.”

Might we suggest that RPI book
all home. games next year and thus
assure a perfect, flawless season.
()r as an alternative, with the com-
plex that the chhmen apparently
have against. playing on foreign

 

courts, perhaps Coach Donald
should emphasize the psychological
angle more in the future.

Not so long ago, when the season
was young. we recall people specu-
lating on next year's varsity with
shoulder shrugs. Now. after the
performance of the freshmen and
the soph varsity men against RPI.
we‘re no so sure that shoulder
shrugs are justifiable. In our
humble I-yw. a largo share of the.
credit for [he varsity victory be—y
longs to llIl' soplls; when they were
in there. they really ll'f'I‘f' in thoro,‘

Last Week We promised the l'msh

the HM year-Hugs. This week We’re
ready lo keep our promise.

out encountering any difficulty,

Some statistics clearly point out
the State domination. Of 59 shots
taken by the victors. 19 or 1-3 were
made as against RPI's 9 out. of 62
attempts. In the first half, when the
Teachers were slowing away the

 

game, the Engineers could sink but
3 of their 32 shots. Without de-
tracting from the fine play of the
winners it must be admitted that
the Troy team had no luck at all.
Conclusion

Last week's victory and a notable
triumph over Niagara made a suc-
cess of what would have been a
dismal year. State had one of its
highest scoring quintets in some
time as the team ran up 42 points
per contest; in amassing 503 tallies.
However they also yielded a record

The game was very close all the

period, the fresh led by one.

Hansen again led the fresh to

with 6 tallies each. Hoskins and

This year's edition of State's frosh

next contest, the yearlings attain-
ed revenge on Academy with a 30-

fresh of Union sent the statesmen
back from Schenectady with a 39-
