Reporter Uncovers Club Secrets
Via Dear Daily Diary of X Group

The News hereby takes pleasure
in reprinting below excerpts from
the diary of a certain unique char-
acter known about the college as
Club X. In the early years of its
life it was somewhat of a waif,
making its home in the thoughts of
many students in State college.
Those people who found it difficult
or impossible to attend after-school
functions were particularly hospit-
able to the little fellow. Last Sep-
tember, however, he was legally
adopted by Student Christian asso-
ciation, who named five godparents
for him: Geraldine Ewing, Beulah
Gifford, and Edgar Perretz, sen-
iors, and Josephine Trumbull and
Benson Tybring. sophomores.

Oct. 10
Dear Diary,
Had a little get-together down in
the Lounge this noon with some of
my old friends, and was introduced
to many new people. We had such
an enjoyable half-hour that we all
decided to try to meet once every
other week at lunch time. We de-
cided to appoint hostesses each time
for the next meeting, and also
made arrangements to serve coffee
or hot chocolate at each meeting.

Oct. 31
Dear Diary,
Heard the cutest definition of a
jitterbug today - a terpsichorian
with d.t.'s. Mr, Hardy pulled it at
the Information Please program
we had in our regular noon meet-
ing. Dr. York asked the questions
and Dr. Green, Dr. Lester, Mr.
Jones, and Mr. Hardy gave the an-
swers. They Were rewarded with
0h Henry’s and gum. Mr. Jones
looked so funny when he talked——
maybe it was the five sticks of gum
in his mouth.

[regular kids at the club meeting,
and got some culture painlessly, at
the same time listening to the re-
cordings of classical and semi-clas-
sical pieces which Whitney's loaned
us. Learned among other things
that a certain Mr. Tschaikowsky
(whom I distinctly remember meet-
ing in Oral English class on one
of the days when I hadn’t prepared
my word list the night before)
wrote a composition called the
Nutcracker Suite.

 

Feb. 13
Dear Diary,

Meeting today. Edgar Perretz
and Mary Jane McNamara, seniors,
spoke to us on the American Youth
conference in Washington which
they attended. One of the topics
under discussion there was the
universal problem of jobs for col-
lege, especially the part—time em-
ployment phase of the question and
the difficulty of finding jobs in the
community. Someone suggested
that we sponsor an Inter-collegiate
conference to discuss this matter
some time next spring or next fall.
March 4
Dear Diary,

Regular meeting today. After
lunch we had mixer—games and
square dancing, in which Miss
Moreiand and a freshman led the
Virginia reel. Plans were also
made for the meeting at which Dr.
Dale DeWitt of New York city will
speak. He is to talk to the regular
Student-Religion commission on
April 11th and will stay over to
discuss with us the struggle for the
survival of ideals on Thursday, the
12th. There were quite a few kids

‘down to the Lounge, but we can al-

ways take care of more. I wonder
how many of the students realize
that everyone is welcome to these

dairymaid. Patience, scoffed at

an idyllic poet. After further com-
plications, matters are settled to
the satisfaction of all except the
fleshly poet.

be played by Edna Potter, '40. The
rival poets will be portrayed by
James Sherwood. '40, as Archilbald
Gi'osvcnor, the idyllic poet; and

World At State Goes
’Round In Goofy Style

The world of today is one of
odds and loose-ends. Last week
a woodpecker flew in an open
window 01' the library just as the
vic downstairs was shouting the
old Italian “Woodpecker Song."
Perhaps it was the song, but
there is a horrible possibility that
some of us may find it necessary
to wear inth when We go into
stoogchaven in the future.

We were no less surprised when
We discovered that the Operatic
chorus had been ousted from
Room 28 last Tuesday night, and
had to rehearse in the lower hall
of Hosted to the rhythm of the
"coke" machine.
