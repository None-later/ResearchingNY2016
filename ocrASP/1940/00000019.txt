overrun with several hundred

for entrance into this institution.

hundred frosh came. Then three
dreary days of testing and “I Q'ing”
followed. But were the freshmen
discouraged? Not that class.

Look at the Campus day pushball
contest. Although they didn’t win,
the trash showed the sophs they
knew what goal lines were for.
They elected Joe Larko and Selma
Leis captains, and took on the
sophs in the traditional rivalry de-
bates, sings and athletic contests.
And speaking of athletics, do you

With $350 Worth of Co-op Jewels

by William Dormncc
Itclnx, follows! The police urcn't

after you. The sensational Co-op
robbery wasn‘t an "inside job."
\Vhat [till I talking about? Why,

the jcwcl robbery that mode the

robbery of the Co—op last Friday
night that netted a gang of dcs-
pcradoes $350 in loot.

Friday was o perfect night for
u. hold—up, 'i‘lie blinding snow and
Soil-cc forced most people from the
streets. Parent’s night was in
progress at Milne. All the college
buildings were open.

At 11:50 o'clock Mrs. Minor, a
cafeteria employee, came down
from tl‘c third floor of Milne and
saw three boys that men) lurking
outside of the Washington avenue
window of the Co-op. Near a taxi
headed out of the rear driveway was
another boy. Upon observing Mrs.
Miner, they fled. She continued
on her way, slightly suspicious.

Apparently the boys returned,
broke the window, and forced the
steel bars. They jumped in, and
with a gall common to thieves, turn-
ed on the Co-op lights and helped
themselves to fountain pens, jewel-
ry, and cameras.

At 12:15 o'clock, George Gifford,

  

<°> . .

nightly
rounds looked out of the auditorium
window and saw two of them with
their arms full of loot. I-ic shout—

headlines from coast to coast; the.

Mr. l-iunt, chief cnginccr, inform—

‘cd the News that no one connected

 

with the college was under sus-
picion. According to Mr, Hunt,
someone took the time to acquaint

himself with the night wutchman's-

routine. “Every night," said Mr.
Hunt, “the watchman tours the
buildings from I'Iuwlcy hall to the
third floor of Milne to set the
twenty-one clocks in the college.
His tour takes him about fifty
minutes, during which time the
buildings are unguarded. As soon
as the thieves saw his flashlight
through the windows of Hawley
hall, they knew he had begun bis
rounds, giving them fifty minutes
to break into the Co-op and take
what they pleased."

Investigation has shown that, be-
cause of the budget out, there are
times when the college has very
little protection. In fact, during
the spring and summer months,
between 1:30 and 3:80 o’clock in
the morning there is no protection
whatsoever.

Nelson Explains New Resolution from Board of Regents;

Present Regulations to

End December, 1942;

Students Will Qualify‘for M.A.

l‘lr. Milton G. Nelson, deun, has released the following informa-
tion in regard to the recently adopted resolution of the Board of Re-

gents providing for the “ﬁve—year l

state secondary school teachers: 0

“The Board of Regents at its reg-
ular meeting on March 17, 1939,
adopted a resolution providing for
five years of academic and profes-
sional education as a prerequisite
for the issuance of certificates valid
for teaching academic subjects in
the secondary schools. Present reg-
ulations that govern certification for
teaching in the secondary school
are to be discontinued on December
31, 1942. All persons, therefore, who
complete present requirements for
secondary school teaching on or be-
fore December 31, 1942, will receive
provisional certification under pres-
ent regulations; all persons who de-
sire to prepare for the teaching of
academic subjects and who will com-
plete such preparation on or after
January 1, 1943, will be required to
complete five years of preparation.

New Requirements

“The requirements established by
the Commissioner of Education pro-
vide that a candidate shall com-
plete a four-year curriculum, ap-
proved for the preparation of sec-
onday school teachers. leading to
a baccalaureate degree (or equiva-
lent preparation) and in addition
thirty semester hours in advanced
courses. This regulation results in
a minimum requirement of 154 se-
mester hours of undergraduate and
graduate instruction. The student
making normal progress may ex—
pect to complete the requirements
for the bachelor‘s degree duirng the
first four years and to qualify for
the master‘s degree during the fifth
year. Under present limitations no
degree can be awarded in fact until
the studies of the fifth year have
been completed and the student is
entitled to a license to teach. The
records of the college will show when l
124 semester hours of approved work l
have been completed (interpreted as,
equivalent to the completion of a
four-year curriculum) and at that
point the student may assume he,
has completed the content require—1
ment for his (lcgl'cc and is entitled
to apply for advanced standing.
Upon completion of an approved
five-year curriculum. the student
will be entitled to receive a per—
manent certificate for teaching
those subjects in which he has at—
tained the minimum content prep-‘
oration as provided in State regu—
lation. This permanent certificate
shall be valid continuously except

sition in the public schools of New

or has not satisfied the in-serve
study and training requirement.
The in-service study and training

during each successive ten-year
period from the date of issuance of
his certificate complete six semester
hours of approved courses or the
equivalent in approved profession-
al activity other than class-room

State Program

“The faculty of the New York
State college for Teachers believe
that those who desire to enter upon
the five-year program of teacher
education must possess good char-
acter, freedom from speech defects,
freedom from physical deformity or
physical weakness, personality char-
acteristics suitable for the profes-
sion, proven ability to accomplish
scholastic tasks, and a sincere desire
to prepare for the profession of sec-
ondary school teaching. After ad-
mission it is proposed to extend the
freshman guidance service in order
that students may have a maximum
amount of faculty assistance and
counsel, particularly during the early
college years, in the selection of
content field in which they may de-
sire to specialize. It is expected
that each student will secure in-
tensive experience in general fields
of education, both intellectual and
social, gradually increasing special-
ization in the fields or subjects of
his special interest until he attains
the maximum of intensity in a

,choscn area during his fifth or grad-
