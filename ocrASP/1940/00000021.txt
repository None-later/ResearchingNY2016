Trotsky.
Most Successful Poll
As far as participation is con-
cerned. this was the most successful
poll conducted by the forum and
indicates the student body’s inter-
est in the current issue. The com—
mittee in charge, headed by Alice
Abelove, ’41, intends to recommend
that the forum have a similar poll
in November when the actual presi-
dential nominees are known.

The results show a change in the
student body's political views. In
a poll conducted in October to de-
termine the college's choice of gov-
ernor. Dewey beat Lehman. How-
ever, in this poll the Democrats re-
ceived 233 votes as against 165 for
the Republicans. Socialist Thomas
