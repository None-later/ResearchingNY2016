(THE COMMENTSTATER is given the widest
latitude as author of this column, though the view-
points expressed do not necessarily reflect those of
the STATE COLLEGE NcwsJ

The proposal in the special Student association
meeting. that campaign speeches be abolished, was
of course defeated. However. the threat of abolition
did accomplish what the less radical of its propo-
nents had hoped It would—a definite improvement in
the substance of the speeches given last Friday.

It will be Interesting to note how many of these
campaign promises and suggestions will be carried
out next year. Although all the candidates will not
be elected, that fact does not prevent the unsuccessful
candidates from presenting their programs to the
student body from the floor. In this way as much can
bc accomplished by the defeated candidates as by the
wmners.

all three candidates for president. All of the nom-
inees agreed that Roberts’ Rulca of Order were writ-
ten to expedite business. not to impede it.

But is the impeding of business caused by rules of
order. by the presiding officer. by Myskania. or b_'
n wholcsalc ignorance of these rules on the part of
all concerned?

Suggestions for remedying this condition ranged
from the appointment of a parliamentarian to the
complete abandonment of Roberts' rules and adopting
what was termed the rule of reason. What the rule
of reason is or will not attempt to say. Mr. Kelly is

 adopting thc first suggestion for this morning’s bud-
' get meeting.

The appointmth has been made for a three-fold

. purpose according to Kelly: “First. campaign speeches
I showed a discontent ln the student body and a clamor
for a parliamentarian; secondly. the appointment will

give the student body a chance to see how a parlia-
mentarian would function. should they desire to ap-
point one next your
discussion this morning makes it mandatory that we
have strict adherence to parliamentary procedure with
the exclusion if necessary from the meeting of those
students who attempt to impede business."

This afternoon State’s chess

seeking revenge for the 4-2 defeat
which the NYU team handed them
earlier in the season. On the trip
the chessmen will play two other
metropolitan colleges. The NYU

two matches which will probably
be with CCNY and Queens or
Brooklyn college.
