STATE Conscssrsws. MAY 3.1940. ..

 

 

by Edwin Holstein

Sisterhood society will confiscate3 —.
the traditional Aurania club tonight Slammer! To Hedda

when Duke Daley and his “Gentle-
men of Rhythm" start the sororai
ball sedately rolling at 10:00 o'clock

tonight.

Fennell, Eldridge and Reynolds—

all not too well known, but all very
good; that’s the band score for
State formals to date. Now over the

top comes Duke Daley also not too

well known, but also, from all re-
ports, very good. We won't agree
or disagree—we’ll give you the re-
ports.

Dapper Duke Daley, the boy with
youth, appearance and personality
in rhythm, deserted his Maine home
and an artist's career for his experi-
‘ment in modern music. This is the
decision that gave us the band we
will hear tonight.

And a little retrospect at the re-
cord Shows Duke supplying stomp
fodder at such superior spots as the
Famous Door, in New York city,
NBC network; Mother Kelly’s, Mu-
tual network; the Golden Gate ball-
room, in San Francisco; The Pasa-
dena Civic center, in Pasadena, Cali-
fornia; the Sunrise ballroom in San
Francisco; the Town Casino club in
Miami, Florida; and the Lookout
house in Cincinnati. Duke and his
boys have also traveled the circuits
of RKO vaudeville and have ap-
peared on the screen under contract
to Universal pictures. Obviously
the Duke has been places.

The style of the band is one of
sophisticated and stomp swing, with
an ample dose of novelty numbers
and special arrangements. Daley’s
is a well-rounded repertoire that will
suit even the most fickle fan. The
Daley group boasts a fine brass sec-
tion with top-notch rhythm and
sax units to fill out their solid style.

For a little item of local interest,
one of the few State students who
have heard Daley is Jack Vavasour,
’42. Jack is the boy who signed
Tommy Reynolds for Soiree back
there in the blizzard of April 12.
From the reception State gave Rey-
nolds, we may deduce that Jack can
pick a winner. He has this to say
about tonight’s band: “When I
heard Daley at the Famous Door, he
impressed me as a band to keep my
eyes on. Any outfit that can play
what the Daley bunch did in the
way that they did is a band worth
hearing."

80 there’s the story, kids—Daley,
a good band, will play for your en-
joyment at Intersorority Ball to-
night. The outfit is there to givo you
a good solid session of swing. Have
yourself a good time and don't for-
get to put in your request for your
own favorite number. Coniidcntiaily,
the Duke loves it.

Female Freedom Idea

Step right up, State, and go
to a debate—an all State debate
with a chance (it's not definite)
of impaling some dainty morsel
on your capable lunch hooks, i. e.
refreshments may possible be
served to the spectators.

The contest will be on the sub-
Ject: “Resolved: That more has
been lost than has been gained
by the new freedom of women."
Forensic fighters will include
Betty Denmark and Janice
Friedman, seniors, for the in-
dignant negative, and John Mur-
ray and Paul Grattan, juniors,
for the confident affirmative.

The debate is a demonstration
contest in the new “Heckle Style".
Each speaker will talk for twenty
minutes. However, at any time
he may be interrupted by ques-
tions from opponents. The con-
test is supervised by a chairman
to prevent misuse of questioning
privileges.
