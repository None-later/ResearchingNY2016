there will emerge from these changes a new Com—

floors, comfortable furniture, and dancingr at any

to have a new rccrcation hall.

Prelude to Pageantry

 

 

Commentstater

These are the days of prophesy and prediction. of
pageantry and power, of displays that absorb the
aspects of destiny. These are the days of marching
men; tomorrow we. too, march. But when We enter
the door of Page hall. we are invading no state, vio-
lating no frontier. We may feel strange, but we are
merely claiming an inevitable new realm that is ours.
We will celebrate the joy and torture of this in-
heritance tomorrow as we move into next year, as
We move tip—and on.

Mali is a creature that takes peculiar pride in the
right of succession, in the passing of property, tradi-
tion, and honor. Moving-up day. howover, is more
than an ordeal of detail. more than a reckoning with
pomp and plunder; it is the culmination of a year,
or more exactly four years in one, for each class has
come to the end of a period. High in the balcony,
decked in green and unusually large ribbon. sits the
freshman, eager, anticipating, boisterous at the slight-
cst excuse for applause. glad for a holiday. happy
that he is at last tree from the apprenticeship of a
first your in college. Near him is the sophomore.
superb in his at‘i‘ectatlon of ease, proudly and defi-
antly hearing his colors. expertly critical of the slight
error in procedure, thoroughly educated by his one
year's experience. Downstairs sits the junior. toying
nervously with his cane, baffled by the mysteries
of success, Jealous of honor. girdcd for the torment
rf the morning's suspense, wondering—and hoping.
Last and least is the senior, ignored in his dignity
of cap and gown, solemn and bored by the ancient
monotony, despairing of the future in the hands of
the juniors, interested chiefly in forecasts he matte
and his money that backod them. This is the stage
and the scene for the pageant.

Perhaps the day will be slow; perhaps the schedule
will be lost early, but there is a pleasure in the wait-
ing in line, not knowing what. will follow There is
a pleasure in listening to familiar speakcrs. in fol-
lowing the shifting scene of activity. We will wonder
again at the flow of announcements, at the honors
and offices. at the prizes and positions. We will be
amused by the faculty, apparently as interested as
the students. Then will come the moment of highest
anticipation. We will see Myskania, itself solemn
and deliberate. slowly pursue the choosing of its
successor—though well substantiated rumor has it
that this year's “tapping” will be remarkably rapid.
The reality of this “tapping” scene could never be
rocnacted. Then when the cheering dies and the
ting program is over. there will be the march along
ntllt’iCllL flanked walks. We will watch the forming
of the black figure “40" for the last, tltnc by the
seniors. Only after the stunts have passed and the
slug is in progress will we realize all this, or will we
be reminded that the year is really over. Previously
we have watched the moving-up. but not until the
final song “Great Fire” can we realize fully that
Moving-up day is accompanied by the loss of the
Class of 1940.

There are those of us who may say that such a
ccromony as this can have but. little lasting effect,
but when we look back, we shall remember little of
pooplc, less of their nature.
ate the days spent in festivities together.
rccall ihc f‘cstoon of colors and the singing. Page
hall and the Maelstrom. our wonder at it all. and
rii-onnt the fading details of the four grout. days in
which we moved—up together.

Play-day was its usual success—
with swimming and boating as ex-
tra-curricular activities. The eve-

buses were aided immeasurably by
George Jacobs' accordion playing.

Alumnae Day and a Camp John-
ston weekend loom on WAA’s hori-
zon—the weekend to be composed
of holdovcrs from the eleven to four
Alumnae Day activities. Prospects
for the attendance at the whole
weekend look good. particularly in
view of the fact that this is to be
the last weekend of the year.
