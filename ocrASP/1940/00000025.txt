Dr. “Tommy”to Teach at Cornell;
Plans Back on Racial Folklore

by June Haushalter O

This June State will say goodbye
to a man who has been on the col-
lege faculty for twenty-five years
—-Dr. Harold W. Thompson, pro-
fessor of English. Dr. “Tommy”
came here in September, 1915, on
his first teaching job and has been
teaching ever since, except for the
two years when he was on leave of
absence.

The first of these “vacations” came
in the school year 1925-26 when
he went to Scotland on a Guggen-
heim grant. In the summer of 1927
he was awarded this fellowship
again. The result of these years
of study abroad was Scottish Man
of Feeling, published in 1931. His
other leave of absence came last year

 

when Dr. Tommy, the recipient of a ‘:
Rockefeller grant for that year, fin- l

ished writing his book on the folk-
lore of New York state, Body, Boots,
and Britches.

In his years of teaching here, Dr.
Thompson has tried to combine lit-
erature with history and music,—“to
cut across departmental lines,” as he
says, “a thing which many of the
faculty do.” His favorite course is
American folk literature, where the
students do original research work.
He has used a great deal of this
student research material in writ;
ing his latest book. “In a way,
says Dr. Tommy, "Body, Boots,
and Britches is a State college
book.”

Not only does this course teach
students how to do original research
work, but also teaches them how to
get acquainted with their own sec—
tion of the country.

Next September will see Dr.
Thompson a professor of English at

Student Leaders
For Association

Assembly to Feature Report
On Student Finances;
Smith Will Speak

Mr. E. L. Cooper, Treasurer of
Finance Board, will report today in
assembly on the financial status of
State College for the present fiscal
year. Lloyd Kelly, retiring Student
Association president, will install
his successor, Merrill Walrath, and
other officers for the 1940-41 term,
Ralph Tibbetts, '42, vice-president,
and Don Vanas, ’43, secretary.

“We wish to offer the thanks of
the Student Association to Louise
Hessney, '40, capable editor of the
DiTGClOT'i, which was issued earlier
this year than ever before," Kelly
commented. “We also want to thank
Mr. Cooper who took ovor the big
job of association treasurer when
Mr. Hidley became ill last Decem-
ber."

Property Inventory

Stanley Smith, ’41, will give the
ﬁrst perpetual inventory of all prop-
erty owned by organizations receiv-
ing support through the Student
Association. As planned, this inven-
tory will be checked once a year. At
the end of the year, the depreciation
on the items is computed and the
new value listed. The revised list of
student property will then be pre—
sented the Student Association.

Records on File

The records show a description,
identifying number, and disposition
of any articles that are sold, dc-
sti'oycd, or discarded during the year.
A duplicate record will be maintain—
ed in Finance Board files. The as-
sociation thus has an accurate mov-
ing record 01' its property, and iii-
dividual leaders will be held respon-
sible. If this report is not ready for
the meeting today, it will be posted

on the bulletin board as soon as the,
organizations complete their inven—1

tory reports.
In addition, Kelly makes the sug-
gestion that the Student Association

should at least consider the advisa-,

bility of using advertisements as the
basis of paying for next year's di-
rectory. The plan this year of sell-
ing the directory to the students has
proved successful. Under the new
provision. competition for advertise-
ments among the college publications

Myskaiiiu Taps Ten Members
in Suspense-Filled Ceremony

The rite and dignity that accom-
panies the tapping of a new Mys-
kania returned to Page hall for a:
few fleeting moments last Friday}
In an unprocedcntedly streamlined:
ceremony, Myskania chose its sue-1
cessors. .

Frank Kluge opened the proceed—f
iiigs. An expectant hush fell over
the auditorium as he moved around
the aisles in long, easy strides and
tapped Roy McCi'cai‘y. In rapid or-
der Kluge was succeeded by Wilson,
Kelly, Howe, Kowaisky, Sullivan,
Trainer, Simmons, Freedman, and
Baird who tapped Murray, Smith,
Kusak, Ag'iie, Walrath, Dower, Mil-
ler, Hallci'. and Beers respectively.

After Baird had returned with
Beers, Kluge stepped out again. The
tension in the auditorium which had
relaxed suddenly increased. only
to ebb again as Kluge circled the
stage and returned to his placo.

At no time did the ceremony re-
semble the excruciatingly dreary
procedure of the year before. At
its conclusion, ten happy Juniors
stood upon the stage, Their Joy
contrasted sharply with the osten-
sible passivity of the tappers. Only
a half smile now and they betrayed
the fact that the rite was as emo-
tional to the tappers as to the tap-
ed.

kania and their school activities in
order of their tapping, are as foi~

The Freshman Handbook for

to Edwin Holstein, '42, editor of
the Handbook.

with the exception of color there

Bropliy was tearing his hair. The
books were promised for Wednes-

Just then the phone rang and a
voice announced that the G—mcn

assistant professor in English. Ad-
mission is seventy-five cents or stu-
dent tax.

One unusual feature of the play
was the stage setting which was
prepared by the Siagecraft class un-
der the direction of Mr. William G.
Hardy, instructor in English.

Theme from Shakespeare

The theme of the play is from
“Julius Caesar" by William Shake-
speare. “The fault, dear Brutus,
lies not in our stars but in our-
selves, that we are undei'lings."
The play centers around Lob, a
middle-aged gentleman, who in-
vites a number of guests to his vii-
la. The guests are constantly com—
plaining that if they only had the
opportunity, they would have lived
their lives very differently. Lob gives
them that opportunity and, as is
to be expected, they relive their
lives just as they had lived them
the first time.
The cast includes: Lob, Peter Hart,
Grad; Mrs. Coade, Beulah Gifford,
’40; Mr. Condo, “The little old man,”
Ernest Case; Mr. Dearth, Hyman
Meitz; Mrs. Dearth, Mary Miller;
Dearth's might~have-been daughter,

Vaikenburg; Lady Caroline, Marlyn
Groff; Mr. Purdie, Robert Hertel;
Mabel Purdie, Lydia Bond; Joanna,
Aime Rattray: Matey, the butler,
Joseph Withey; juniors.

Conklin, chairman, Ernest Case, Ly-
dia Bond, Juniors; house, Mary Mar-
die, '40, Douglas Dillenbeck, co-chair-
men, Marlyn Gi'of’f, Mary Miller;

Jean Scott, chairman, Robert Her-
tel, Anna Rattray; sets, Barbara
Van Patten, Irene Poger, co-chair-
men, Shirley Van Valkcnbui'g, Hy-
man Meltz, Juniors.

Dramatic events next year will

the Dramatics and Arts Association.
As announced on Moving-Up Day
they are: president, Mary Miller,
'41; secretary, Don Vanas, '43;
treasurer, Katharine Richards, '42.

tutional requirement of male repre-
sentation, Donald Vanas, '43. has

maties course. These members will

matic ability and degree of interest.
