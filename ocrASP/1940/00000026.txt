i.R.M.
THIS WEEK marks the end of a
t

 

year of sports at State—a year

at can hardly be classed as com-

pletely successful, but one that was
not devoid of its bright spots.

Varsity sport was initiated in the
fall with cross country. The har-
riers dropped their three scheduled
meets in rapid succession, however,
thus carrying on the tradition of
the previous year's team which was
also outrun in all its encounters.
Inasmuch as some capable fresh-
man material was brought to light,
the season was not a total flop.

December saw the start of a bus-
ketball campaign that was destined
to be one of the whackiest of re-
cent years. High spots of the season
included our lialrbreadth 51-50 vic-
tory over Niagara U. and the game
with the hot Sicna outfit which
drew one of the biggest—if not the
biggest-crowds in the history of Page
Hall Gym.

The ill-fated baseballers are lll the
process of cleaning up their sched-
ule this weekend. Varsity ten-
nis also winds up this week.

And thus ends a year.

NEW MAA COUNCIL has been.
elected to serve for the com-

ing season. We'd like lo urge that
council to fight for the betterment of
men's sports at State during 1940-
41. This year has had its nasty
rumors relative to the curtailment
of sports. May we urge the new,
council to keep such rumors from
flaring into fact. .

We should also like to take this,
opportunity to inform the new MAA.

SLS Regains Top Rung

In Close League Race
Sigma Lambda sigma regained
the lead in the men's intramural
softball league when it beat the
Ramblers and College House Tues-
day and Wednesday evenings. With
Del Mancuso's pitching, the SL8
boys have really been going to town.
Kappa Beta and Kappa Delta Rho
are tied for second, after KDR de-
feated College House Wednesday
night, and the Ramblers Tuesday
night. KDR has been boosting its
average principally because of ﬁeld-
ing and because of Moe Steven's
pitching.

Traditional 
Game Tomorrow

 

This afternoon the baseball squad
meets Pratt on the Bleecker Sta-
dium field at 3:00 o’clock. This is
the team that beat us by a score
of 6-4 in Brooklyn last Saturday.
The fact that our team was ahead
at one point in that game makes it
appear possible for the boys to eke
out one win this season.

The diamond season closes tomor-
row afternoon when the hapless
Btate nine meets a fairly strong
RPI aggregation on the Troy ﬁeld.
Even though the chance of a State
win is fairly remote, there is a loyal
band of state rooters who are char-
tering a bus to make the trip with
the team. To Join, this group all
that is required is signing up on
the main bulletin board.
