‘g 49 , polsiiig for'its momentous

p out into the great unknown—

time has come for retrospec-

_ tion' ahd digestion of the contents
of .the year.

State has seen many things in
the last few months, both great and
small; both novel and traditional.
The traditional we know; the in-
novations we should remember . . .

The year is first memorable in
that we started it without the guid-
ing hand of our beloved Dr. Bru-
bacher. We sailed into a new “five-
yeer sea“ with a cargo of freshmen
to he delivered into that far-off
land of the M.A. degree. They are
nearly ready to disembark in their

t port.

The budget cut which we so ar-
dently fought last year came into
play, and we experienced retrench-
ing on all sides. The merger of the
lotto and Lion into the Statesman
has become a reality, with the pub-
lication of our new magazine. We
can now judge the success of this
experiment.

Early in the year, a new spirit
of political and parliamentary re-
form seized the student body which

resulted 'in‘ ,(1) much bickering in
assembly with frequent, references
to Raberts’ Rules of Order, (3) a
new voting system, (3) investiga-
tion of organized activity, (4) a new
note in campaign speeches, and (t)
a two-day stand by Murray as par-
liamentarian.

In another phase, this year has
brought other changes in the realm
of student living. With an eye to
sail ghtenment of the student body,
Stewart Smith, '40, instigated a vic-
trola and public address system.
His original idea of news broad-
casts throughout the day has not
materialized, and there has been dis-
satisfaction with the dance music
in the Commons. Perhaps next year
will see a better and more effective
system.

The spring has seen developments
which are also looking upward.
First of all came the confirmation
of the rumor that a new Commons
will be provided next year in Husted

Hall, dedicated to the late Dr. Bru-
bacher. Already we have seen the
renovating spirit manifest itself in
the painting of the interior of Hust-
ed.

Recent activity on the campus by
the janitorial staff gave us the
benches left to us by the class of ’39,
and a sparkling new drinking foun-
tain at the door to the Commons.

Thus State College has progressed
in the realm of student government
and student affairs with corres-
ponding changes in both curriculum
and in buildings. We have not
gone far enough, perhaps, but next

‘year . . . well, let’s wait and see.

‘a year.
