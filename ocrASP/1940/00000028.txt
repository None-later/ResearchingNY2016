Bulger Forms
Job Committee

Proposed Set-up Designed
To Increase Efficiency of
Employment Bureau

Paul Bulger, Assistant to the Prin-
cipal of Milne High School. this
Week announced formation of an un-
dergraduate committee to supple-
ment the work of the Student Em—
ployment Bureau which is under his
direction.

Its six members, representatives
of the upper classes of State Col-
lege, will meet for the first time
Tuesday at 3:30 p. m. in room 12
Milne High School, to discuss effec-
tive means for familiarizing the en-
tire student body with the operation
of the bureau.

Personnel

Committeemen are: Clarence Olsen
and Catherine O'Brien, seniors;
Ralph Tibbetts and June Haushal-
ter, juniors; Owen Bombard and
Lois Hailey, sophomores. Present
plans call for the addition of two
graduates and two freshmen stu-
dents at midyear.

Basic purpose of the committee,
according to the administration, is
to serve as middle-man between the
bureau and the student body.

"Not only will we aim to make
State students more job-conscious
before their senior year, but we will
prepare for them a fair, detailed
explanation of the use of the money
they invest upon registration in the
Bureau," Bulger said.

Money Disbursion Explained

"Any questions concerning place—
ment in teaching positions may be
referred to the people on this stit—
dent committee. They will be equip-
ped to explain such problems as the
mines of job-seeking. technique of
the personal interview. suitable sub-
ject combinations.”

There will be a general meeting
of all graduate students and seniors
in Room 20 of Richardson Hall at
3:30 P. M. 'I‘hursday.

All Surprised
As Job Starts
On August 12

Contributions From Alumni
Will Pay ior Structure
Over 30 Year Period

Alumni Residence Hall No. 2 for
which ground has been broken is not
a move to do away with fraternities
or sororities. The hall will accommo-
date one hundred and twenty men,
the majority of whom will be
Freshmen. The current rumor to
the contrary has been entirely de—
nied by both Dr. John M. Sayles,
acting president of the college, and
Mrs. Bertha Brimmer of the Alumni
Association.

They said that any idea of putting
women in the proposed men’s dormi-
tory is entirely false and should be
treated as such. Mrs Brimmer
pointed out that the many alumni
with fraternal and sororal affilia-
tions have always been exceedingly
wary about doing anything to hurt
their respective organizations.

Surprise Start

The excavation which is now in
progress came as a complete sur-
prise to the student body. Mrs Brim-
mer. who is executive secretary of
the building committee, has ex-
plained the speedy action as follows:

“The building was started at this
time because of a long-felt need
for better housing conditions for
the men of State College. The build—
ing committee, after considering
the proposition for nearly a year,
decided to take advantage of a time
when building was at a low ebb.
Contractors were anxious to keep
organizations intact. Likewise. there
would be no appreciable increase in
the available building funds by de-
laying the building of the Residence
Hall until 1944, on our one-hun-
dredth anniversary, as was planned.
Building Prestige

Dr. Sayles said in
that every student in State Col-
lege should want better housing
conditions because of the prestige
it would bring to this institution. He
pointed out. that the completion of
the girl's Alumni Residence Hall
twas chiefly responsible for State's
admission to the American Associa-
tion of University Women. If every
student. would pay 25c. a week to a
state college biiildlng fund for the
{rest of his life, we would have an un-
‘limlted building program. The new
lrcsidencc hall will be paid for in

about thirty years.

‘thut was experienced with the floor
jot the logic Room of the present
"'dorm". Suylcs said that adequate
precautions have been taken to
‘avoid any reoccurrencc of such an
lexperience. He explained that when
the present building was built. one
wall acted as a dam gathering mois-
ture against which the wood was
not projected. This condition has
been rectified already in thc pre—
sent "dorm."

Ground was broken unceremoni-
ously on August. 12th. Foundations
are being laid and much of the steel
will be erected before winter. The
building will be ready for use in one
year. It is being paid for by pledges
in the alumni started by the class
of 1936. However, gifts have been
coming in mainly from men who
have been graduated as far back as
1919.
