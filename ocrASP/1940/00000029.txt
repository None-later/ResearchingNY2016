Typographic Sanity
lie not the “rat by whom the new is tried
Nor yet the ltlﬂl to 1in the old ttuide.
—Pope, “An Essay on Criticism"
Today’s issue of the STATE COLLEGE News is
an experiment. it is also in certain respects a

compromise. it is a compromise between stream-
lining gone berserk and conventionalism to an
extreme.

The essential aim of modern typography is situ-
plicity. This issue is far removed from being any
realization of that aim. Nevertheless, it is a start.
And it is an attempt to make your NEWS physically
more attractive and to make its reading "easier on
the eyes.” Subsequent issues will see this typo—
graphy—already the result of long planning —~
subjected to extensive modification. The “golden
mean”—the “best” setup—it is hoped will emerge
from this semester of experimentation.

“Conservative-Liberal” is the most appropriate
classification for this typographic departure.
Criticism—both constructive and destructive—will
be welcomed.

A New Five Year Plan

 

The frosh have been welcomed. liarly and dirty
rushing by fraternities and sororities has already i
begun. The hue and cry after Frosh Camp has
lessened. Unorganized rivalry is again presenting,
its problem. And our Student Association faces'
the problem of the “Fifth Year.”

The year 1940—1941 will be important to our
Student Association. It will be almost cpochal,
though epochal is a term we must reserve for 1941-
1942 when even greater difficulties will arise. Sept-
ember, 1940 marks the entrance of a second fresh-
man class required to remain five years. So far
the only concern expressed by any student about
this is to complain of decreased tax payments.

Faculty committees have been discussing, filmi-
ulating, and experimenting with plans for the “Fifth
Year." The administration is determined that it
will not be caught unprepared when the “Fifth Year"
becomes a reality. Can the Student Association
say the same?

Not one organization has even begun to consider
what definite effects a "Fifth Year” will have on its
operation. it must be recognized that our financial
problem is but a temporary one. Finance board ‘
will cxpcricncc no difficulty in meeting budget dc~
mantis with five classes of 250 each. More impor-
tant, we must plan during this “period of financial
duress” to readjust the Student Association that it
may embrace an active fifth year.

Red Roses to the administration for opening the
only exit from lower I’Iawlcy. ()nly “inuncasurablc”
describes the addition to fire safety and student
convenience.

The Commentstater—-——-

John B. Kennedy can go to Hell! 1 1 He has done his
utmost to innoculate the present war with dissatisfac-
tion of being purely European. Thanks to his ilk it
has already become “Britain’s sacrifice,” “The war of
democracy,” and “Our battle fought by Britain.”
Spurred on by ambitious American “diplomats” who
have been relieved of their duties by the march of
Hitler, frightened by army chiefs with a boarding house
reach, and completely subdued by the amateur as-
trologists now at large who forecast that the Atlantic
ocean is about to evaporate. the Congress of the United

States has come to the momentous de-

 

Cocking cision that America must defend her-
Collective self. Who the enemy is and when this
Chins monster will arrive no one knOWS. All

We need do is fill in our own blanks,
pay our taxes, support the army, and above all ask no
questions. But it is time to ask questions. It is an ac-
cepted fact that when a person is looking for trouble
he can find it. Why, then, is the United States stick-
ing its collective nose into a meat chopper?

We, as good citizens must not, of course. engage in
such fifth-column activity as suggesting that a major
portion of our infamous representatives are in need
of buttons. The unpreiudiced Winchells of our “free
press" and the anti-Lindberghs of our “free-radio”
have decreed it high treason to question the activities
of Congress on such a vital issue. They have made it
increasingly apparent that we should only question
Congress on unimportant matters. We can comfort
ourselves by assuming that before enacting the con—
scription bill. Congress thoroughly studied the Gallup
poll. which may be considered much more accurate
as a guide to solving a life and death problem than
a national plebiscite. We must be broadminded about
the whole thing and realize that plebiscites are often
unfortunate in that they tend to measure the senti-
ment of the people. This very sentiment is dangerous.
especially in a dictatorship. because it represents
the animal level of life. We "animals" shall under
present plans soon be the power behind America‘s
international racketeering.

From now on when we play the bully. it may be
>assumed that we are defending ourselves. We have
ialrcady annexed certain military rights in Canada.
We have acquired more of the same from the fading
‘Eritish Empire. We have erected some giant guns
lacross the Behring Straits from Siberia which are

Monroe international date line. In short we
1Doctrine have thumbed our nose at everything
l1940 thoroughly. Where do we go from

here in the way of defense? In all
probability the 20 republics (not democracies.) to the
South will shortly fall victim to another dose of
"good neighborliness." from which at present they
are incapable of defending themselves. This is the
present set-up of the neutrality-isolation theory. This
is the new 1940 edition of the Monroe doctrine
streamlined for high speed and greater air-flow. Our
mastery of self-defense has naturally improved with
time, but time does not alter this fact: preparedness
is the first stage of aggression.

Self-defense is particularly dangerous at a time
when the ego is being inflated. By the very texts of
our latest war measures we are building a war ma-
chine that will operate anywhere in this hemisphere.
This measure was adopted with the express consent
Eof exactly one of the countries concerned: the United
States of America. To add to the general confusion
the President of the United States only a few months
ago at the time of the fall of Denmark accomplished

It is high time we realized that it is i'oolhardy to

are sacrificing much for this dubious

sports program is apparently being
organized, may we add our wal-
come to the countless others with
which the Frosh have been show-

may We append a suggestion.
State‘s sports set-up provides op-
portunities for students experienced
or interested in almost any type of
athletics. In addition to our major
sports, an extensive intramural pro-
gram is maintained. Freshmen

 

should avail themselves of these op—‘

about four innings 'till he was

Score Revealed

By the way. this reminds us that
i on might be interested in knowing
that the score of the game was
12 to 9 in favor of the upperclass-
men. Del Mancuso pitched for the
illiterates. turning in a matchlcss
performance. In fact. if he had
pitched any slower balls they would—

reach from the foregoing is that
the faculty cannot play softball. In

With a full program to keep them

Shortage of Labor

Prevents Rebuilding

Failure of the summer
months to witness a. com-
plete rebuilding, renovating
of the lower hall of Husted
may be laid squarely at the
door of national defense.

According to Dr. Sayles.
a paucity of skilled labor
made impossible the use of
PWA funds earmarked for
the B r u be c b er Memorial
Room and new Cafeteria.
Skilled labor has been at a
premium for many years
now, and the recent spurt of
industrial activity prompted
by the world crisis has al-
most completely absorbed
the fast shrinking market.

Thus the territorial integ-
rity of the present commons
in lower Hawley was pre-
served.

Council Outlines 
Sports Program

New Rulings Govern Football;
Net Tournament Bolsters

Fell Athletic Activity

The fall sports program as re-
leased by Intramural Council prom-
ises to provide plenty of activity
for all athletically inclined States-
men.

Touch football, operating under
new rules this year, makes up
the greater part of the program.
The whistles will be handled by
alert, standardized officials accord-
ing to Hal Duffy and Les Gerdts
who are in charge of the pigskin
parade. It is possible that innova-
tions in the form of goal posts are
expected to add color to the encoun-
ters, by making possible tries for
extra points via the placement or
di'opkick route. Nine teams will com-
pete for the crown with representa-
tives from each of the four fratern-
ities, Ramblers, College House. Frosh,
and a pair of entries from the com-
bined resources of Brubacher. Avalon,
and Robin Halls. The opening date
of the schedule is still indefinite,
but hostilities will begin not later
than Wednesday.

Lending impetus to the autumnal
program will be a tennis tournament
open to all racket-wieldcrs who wish
to exhibit their ability before the
eyes of Varsity Captain Stan Smith.
Any promising material will be given
opportunity to strive for the vacan-
cies on State's net team. If the
weather does not permit the comple-
tion of the matches this fall, com-
petition will be resumed in the
spring.
