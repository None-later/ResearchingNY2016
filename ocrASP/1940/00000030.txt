this thing done before June."

With a good-natured smile and
this caustic reminder, Mike Vignola.

men’s dorm that is going up opposite
the girls’ dormitory.

With a roar. the tractors and
steam shovels responded to Mike's
words. Tractors darted here and
there pushing trucks out of the
mire. hauling cords of lumber.
Since August 12, a peaceful field
has become the prey of hungry
steam shovels.

Work To Be Done By June

“Yup”. said Mike proudly, “we're
coming along fine. We’ve got a dead-
line to meet by June 1 and by heck.
we’re going to meet it.”

Puddles of water were collecting
in the deeper portions of the ex-
cavation. Mike pointed at the pools
and exclaimed. “Theml”, and he
added disparagingly, “They don't
mean a thing. We're taking precau-
tions to make sure the water won't
warp the basement floor the way it
did the floor of the Ingle room.
With the special materials going in
this floor. it‘ll never buckle.

“All my contract calls for is erec-
tion of the building." Mike explain-
ed. As far as the furnishings are
concerned, the architect and Dr.

 

PTEB inaugurates
Change in Program

Applicants Must Cooperate
With Bureau Officials

The Part Time Employment Bu-
reau has started its program for
the year. As a new feature. applica—
tion blanks are going to require a
picture of the applicant. Due to the
new monthly reports required. and
the new listing records. there will
be more work. Ethel Williams, '41,
Peter Fulvio, '42. and possibly Har—
old Feigenbaum. '43, will assist Harry
Passow. director.

The bureau wants more coopera-
tion from the students who apply
for jobs and immediate reports on
all leads they are given. People
who fail to report at once will not
be given help again. Many good
positions were lost last year be-
cause people did not report back
to the bureau. Students must also
report if for any reason they lose
the jobs they have. Everyone is
asked not to apply for work unless
it is absolutely necessary.

The bureau has some leads on
work for Saturdays and the Christ-
mas vacatlon. but people who take
va.’ation jobs must promise to he

State Welcomes
Cornelia Skinner
To Page Stage

Famous Actress Will Appear
in Program of Monologues
Thursday Night at 8:15

Dramatics and Arts Council will
initiate its new policy of bringing
famous artists to State College,
when it presents Cornelia Otis Skin-
ner. celebrated monologist, in Page
Hall. October 3 at 8:15 P. M.

State College students will see
Miss Skinner in such monologues as
“Motoring in the Nineties". “Home-
work". the satire "Being Presented",
and the grim drama of “Lynch
Party”. 01‘ “Hotel Porch".

Miss Skinner. coming from a fam-
ily of actors. was meant for the
stage at the outset. After studying
at Bryn Mawr and at the Sorbonne
in Paris. she made her professional
debut with her father in Ibanez's
“Blood and Sand". Other roles in
other plays followed.

Character Sketches

But dissatisﬁed with this type of
acting. Miss Skinner turned to the
character sketch and originated her
Modern Monologues. which form the
basis of her career. Her success was
instantaneous. In the course of a
few years. her tours included such
famous European capitals as Lon-
don. Paris. and Rome. She has play—
ed four successful engagements in
the British capital.

The ambitious Miss Skinner. seek-
ing a still wider medium. developed
sequences of related scenes which
approach full-length plays. For ex-
ample. "Edna. His Wife". her solo
drama in eleven scenes. runs as long
as a three-act play. In this sketch
she used scenery for the first time.

The talented American actress ap-
peared this summer at the Mohawk
Drama Festival sponsored by Union
College in Schenectady. Her presen-
tation was well received by an en-
thusiastic audience.

ltadio and Writing

In addition to her stage work.
Miss Skinner has appeared in vari-
ous radio programs. She has shown
her writing ability by contributing
humorous commentaries which ap-
pear frequently ln The New Yorker
and other leading periodicals. A col-
lection of these articles has been
publisher] in a book entitled “Ex-
cuse It. Please!" which sold well.
She has also written another book.
called "Dithcrs and Jitters".

Miss Agnes F‘utterer of the Eng-
lish Department. has acclaimed her
by saying. "Cornelia Otis Skinner
has no poor in hcr field.” This com-
ment is heartily echoed by Stage
magazine: “We like not only the
one woman theater. but the one
woman."

(lcneral admission for the per-
formance will be $1.00 or student tux

 

tickets. Reserved seats may be pur-
cllascd for $1.50.

Hertei Forms
For Formal Senior Hap

According Io tradition. State's
ill‘hi formal (luncc will be given by
the seniors. Novcmbcr first has been
set as litc date for this annual
Scnlor llop.

ltohcl'l llcrtel. vice—president of
the senior class. is general chairman
of thc crcnt. Glenn W. Clark is
chairman of the music committee
with llillcs Novolli. Stephen Bull.
Miriam Nl'Wt‘ll and John Alden as—
sisting.

As yet unannounced are the place.
the orchestra. and the price of the
bids.

Last year. for the first time. the
dance was held at the Hotel Ten
Eyck instead of at tho Aurania
Club. as was customary. The most
significant feature was the reduction
in the price of bids from $3.00 to
$3.50. Len Fenaall provided the music
and was wall received.
