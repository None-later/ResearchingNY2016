Lack of WPA

Skilled Workers
Halts Memorial
Dr. some. Lack

Oi Technical Workers
To War Absorption

The Brubacher Memorial Room

which was planned and promised to
the students of State College last
year has not been erected because
the work could not be done by WPA
workers. The local WPA has no
workers capable of doing this J0l).'
The work is specialized, and for that
reason, skilled technicians are an
absolute necessity if the job is to
be a success. Skilled electricians, tin
smiths, and plasterers are not avail-
able at this time.

These are the reasons advanced
by Dr. John M. Sayles, acting presi—
dent in a recent interview.

Sayles Explains

Dr. Sayles explained that it was
highly improbable that there would
be an early start on the work be-
cause the war situation would neces-
sitate the employment of all these
workers in industry.

The $200 that was appropriated by
the Student Association to aid in
this work is in a local bank, paya-
ble to Stanley Smith, ’41, and Harry
Passow, '42, who are the remaining
members of the student committee
appointed for this purpose last June.
One hundred dollars was also ap-
propriated by the class of ’40, mak-
ing a total of $300.

WPA Shortage

Upon being questioned as to this
shortage of labor, Dr. Donna] V.

AN UNPRECEDENTED TIE --- made possible this

position of Campus Queen.

 

The successor to Queen Jane I will be,

Alina Knowles, Mary Miller. Miriam Newell, Lona Powell, or Made

 

Smith. of the Social Studies depart-
ment. said that the only men who
are on the WPA are manual labor-
ers, and these would not be capa-
ble of doing the job. The reason
that the job must be done by WPA
workers is that $300 is not a suffi-
cient sum for the purpose.

Dr. Smith also stated that whether
or not we become involved in the
war, industry will need all its skilled
workers, consequently none will be
on the WPA.

Since it is improbable that the
State will see fit to make any appro—
priation for this purpose, Merrill
Walrath, president of Student Asso-
ciation, will transfer the money
from its dormant position in the
local bank to the Student Associa-
tion funds.

Meanwhile, the Hawley Hall Com-
mons will remain in use as the re-
creation center. A sum of $50 was
appropriated in last Friday's Assem-
bly for new speakers and wiring

   
 
 
   
   

News Polls to Survey

State Political Views

A poll of student opinion
will be taken next Friday
morning in assembly by the
Saw”: Common News in an ef-
fort to determine the attitude
of the student body in re-
gard to the current national
political situation.

Students will be questioned
as to their choices for presi-
dent, vice-president and U. S.
senator from New York in the
fall elections. Also asked will
be student's attitude on the
third term question.

To determine how opinion
is divided among the various
classes in the college. each
person will be asked to tell
which class he is in, and
whether he is eligible to vote
this fall.

The search for a successor to

to six candidates. Voting last Mon-

the nomination of Beatrice Dower,

Final Balloting

Final balloting for Campus Queen
will be conducted Monday on the
Commons balcony from 9:00-400
P. M. All tax-paying members of
the Student Association are eligible
to vote in this election.

Voting last week was unusually
light. although a much more im-
pressive turnout is expected for
Monday’s final test. The actual re—
sult will be withheld until the cere-
mony of carnation on Campus Day,
October 19.

This marks the first year that
more than five candidates have been

 

' nominated for the regal honor. A

two way tie made this necessary. As
customary, the correalation between
the Prom Queen nominees and Cam-
pus Queen nominees was very high.

.  This year all five of the 1940 Prom

Queen nominees were named. The
newcomer to the group was Mary
Miller.

Speculation as to the outcome runs
rife in the student body. Sororities
are gathering strength in an effort
to capture this election, partly be-
cause of the prestige to be gained,
and more so for its affects'on sor-
ority rushing.

October 19 will also start the
sophomore and freshmen classes on
their drive for the rivalry cup. To-
night Myskania will explain the
rivalry rules to members of the two
classes in attendance at the Sopho-
more reception.

the course of the afternoon, several

In the evening, the various classes

will present command performances
before the newly-crowned queen and
her attendants. Robert Hertel has
been appointed overseer of these
skits. Skit directors include: Enes

was that the dance was highly suc-
cessful. v
Although no announcement has
been made so far, it is assumed that
the bids will range around $2.50.
