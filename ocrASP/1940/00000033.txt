Give lcm a Break

Since their arrival in Albany, the freshmen
have been greeted, entertained, and received
a minimum of twenty-one times in less than
four weeks. It is generally agreed that the
freshman year is the most difficult. The
yearling, leaving the sheltered seclusion of
family home life, must adopt himself to a
new environment, new people, new school life,
and new situations. The newcomer must lose
the inferiority complex of new surroundings
or drop the superiority complex carried over
from running the home-town high school.
The arrival must generally learn to meet and
face new experiences.

Spending the greater part of the time
adapting themselves to the new environment
and attending on the average of a reception
every other night, the freshmen—who have
miraculously withstood the trials and tribula-
tions of welcome speeches and other details
that inevitably go with a reception—now face
the most hazardous period since their arrival
at State College. Until Thanksgiving if a
man, and Christmas if a woman—members
of the Class of 1944 will undergo the most
hectic time yet—namely, the sorority and
fraternity rush period.

Still adjusting themselves and attempting
to make up work missed by attending recep-
tions, all the freshman can hope for is a break
—a break that will make this rush period a
bit different from past ones—perhaps a little
cleaner, a little above board, a little less high-
pressured, or a little less “knock down-drag
cut.” if so, the freshmen may be able to look
back on this period of tea dances, buffet sup—
pers, smokers. dances, and parties as a happy
experience rather than an exhausting night-
mare.

Give 'em a break, Greeks.

No fcaturc of tho STATIC COLLEGE
NEWS is more widely read or as first sought
as is its personal column—“The Statesman".
Of that fact, there can be no doubt. Nor can
it be doubted that the high-schooiish, boy-
mcets girlish drivel which is “'i‘hc Statesman”
represents all all time low in writing .More so
than any other column, it has boon so many
wasted lines of type.

Previous years have seen “The Statesman”
experiencing numerous ups and downs,
numerous “ins” and “outs”. its hectic career
has been one of constant expiration and
phoenix-like resurrection. Today’s ignoblc
"Statesman" is the last~—in the present series.

If the student body wants a “dirt” column,
it must supply a writer. The feature will be
continued only if an acceptable “Statesman”
is submitted by any member of the student
body not later that Wednesday night. Other-
wise it must meet a happy demise.

Order and Disorder

 

 

The Clilil.

To write a column of criticismlthnt the relief when it's over is so
when there is nothing to criticize islgrcat then that even adverse notices

a job for the little man who wasn't
there.

There are rumors in dramatic cir-
0185 that last year’s Advanced Dra-
matics group has formed an alumni
association and is planning to pres—
ent scenes from Shakespeare, some-
time ln December. The whole thing
is very indefinite, as yet, and in its
formative stages. We hope to see
a realization of this plan. Shake-
speare has been neglected too long
at State College. For anyone who
has been in one of Dr. Tommy’s
classes in Shakespeare and has read
the Bard with that admirable gent,
there is something in Lear, Hamlet,
Macbeth and the others which can be
found nowhere else. This group is
well-trained and will. I am sure,
do Shakespeare justice.

Those of you who saw Miss Skin-
ner last night will be pleased, I am
sure, to read her article in last Sun-
days‘ Ncw York Times Magazine.
She comments with the biting sar-
casm of one who knows, on the
Broadway first night, the glamour,
the heartaches and the headaches.
She is especially adept in describing
how the actor feels: “And what of
the actor amid all this so-called
brilliance? The poor wretch plays
as secondary a part as the groom at

can be endured." There‘s a lady who
knows her theater.

According to Maestro Pcrln‘lan,
there is a great deal of musical tal-
ent in the freshman class. The or-
chestra has already begun rehearsals
and great things will be forthcom-
ing. There will be a concert with
a vocalist and another with a com—
mentator. A wide and varied season
is contemplated, with many novelties
to delight the ear of the State Col-
lege audience. There will also be.
according to report, an enlargement
and consolidation of the band which
lent so much martial fervor to last
year's basketball games.

In the near future, the assembly
program will consist of a “heckle-
type” debate possibly between two
rival organizations or classes. State
college for years has pioneered new-
type debates and has constantly
tried out any novel debate styles
which seemed at all practical or
feasible. The “Heckle—type" Was tried
out for the first time last year in
one of the rivalry debates. It con—
sists of two speakers for each side
who each deliver twenty-minute
speeches. which at any time can be
interrupted by a question from
either of the opposing speakers per-

 

a. society wedding and is an even
worse state of collapse. He hears the
hubbub outside and thinks. 'Happy,
happy people! They don’t know'.
Peeking through the curtain, he
spots the critics and thinks, 'They
know, but they don’t care’. He won-
ders whatever made him want to be
an actor, whatever made him think
he is. People come up to him. pat
him on the back and say, ‘Good luck,’
as if he were a test pilot about to
take off in a condemned plane. He
tries to think of his opening line
and can’t, of his closing line, and
that, too, eludes him. His throat is
dry, his heart pounding itself into a
rapid angina and his hands are like
aspens in a gale. It's a replica of an
actor's nightmare, only worse; be-
cause in the typical actor's night-
mare things of a fascinating nature

 

occur, such as finding one's self
playing Hamlet stark naked. I sup—
pose the only reason any of us live
through opening after opening is

taining to the subject.

The name. “heckle,” is derived by
the simple fact that questions allow
the opposing speakers to interrupt
the debater to the point where it is
almost heckling him. Judging by last
year’s tryouts, this type of debate
proved more interesting to the
audience and more amusing as a
type of debate than any other ever
tried out. The constant heckling
during the freshman-sophomore
rivalry debate, when it was first
tried out, kept the audience chuck-
ling throughout the entire program.

Milne nas snatched up this new
debate style, appreciating its value
as an audience—pleaser as well as
its worth as a debate system. In the
near future, in State College as-
semblies, students will be used in a
mass guinea-pig experiment. This
will prove whether this type of de-
bate is as amusing to twelve hundred
students as it certainly was to fifty
students.

’ An Eyc' 'For An Eye

The Commentinth

We’d like to introduce Mary Jane Smith of Epsilon
Omicron Mu sorority. You’ve seen her around the halls
we're sure. She's the average sorority girl who blitz-
krich down on some likely frosh woman and, with a
speed and technique that any State man would envy,
puts her arm around the frosh's waist and does 9. Ruth-
Naomi (a little more subtly, we’ll grant you) : “Whither
thou gocst. I wilt go; and whither thou eatest, whether
it be annex, Mayflower or Boul, I wilt eat, and thy
friends shall be my friends."

From time to time, Mary Jane will dive into the
crowds of passers-by and come up with another sorority
sister. Gradually more and more Epsilon Omicron Mus
join the happy little circle and soon they have a line
of defense that is lmprcgnable. It is just such little
gatherings as this that keep Mary Jane very busy from
nine ill the morning until ﬁve at night, and it is just
such little gatherings as this that would keep her busy
from ﬁve at night until nine in the morning, with some
hours out for sleep of course, if Intersorority Council did
not forbid rushing then. We feel that
this rest-from-rushing period is essen-
tial to the physical health and to the
scholastic work of both sorority girls
and freshmen.

We’re pretty strong for that rule which forbids
double—dating, too. If you allowed sorority women to
speak to frosh women, actually, to rush frosh women,
if they were on double-dates, we predict that the num-
ber of double-dates between upperclassmen and frosh—
women would multiply over night. It seems that the
men are against this double-dating rule. Their real
objection, we suspect, is that this rule puts a damper
on one of their most effective means of rushing.

“Rushing” to State College means treat ’em nice,
haul 'em in, and pledge 'em. In previous years the
grab-bag policy that dominated Intersorority Tea was
hard on both the freshmen and the sorority women.
The latter were expected to shower all of their atten-
tions and dancing ability on the freshmen who some-
how managed to reach their particular section of the
gym floor. Intersororlty Tea was a progressive affair
wherein a freshman remained for one set of dances
at each table. The trouble was, however, that many
frosh progressed in circles; that is, a circle with a very,
very, small radius. so that they met never more than
half of the groups.

This year rushing in the form of “Open Houses”
instead of a Tea is a more natural situation for both
frosh and sorors. No longer is the fresh brain a con-
fusion of faces, hats with feathers, music. and TEA.
Congratulations to Intersorority Council
for devising a plan which is advantag-
eous to both the rusher and the rushee!
This week has proved that the plan is
workable. At the “Open Houses," fresh-
men had an opportunity to associate individuals with
a speciﬁc group and a specific setting whereas previ-
ously they never saw the sorority house except in the
unnatural setting of formal rush parties. By having
only three or four parties a. night, each with a time
allotment, the neophytes can visit, impress, and be
impressed—all this without being stepped on, elbowed
by a crowd, and without an unquenchable desire to sit
down.

These parties were more work for the sorority girls
and for Intersorority Council, but the end results have
already proved the worth of the revision.

Bombshell I

Negotiations destined to make the
1940-41 State basketball campaign
one of the most outstanding in the
team's history have just been re-
vealed by MAA Council in a bomb-
shell announcement that contracts
have been signed, sealed, and de-
livered with both St. Lawrence and
Clarkson for clashes with the Purple
and Gold this year.

The tilt with St. Lawrence is
scheduled for play at Canton on
Saturday, December 14. State fans
will share in the Clarkson tussle,
booked for Monday evening, Decem-
ber 9, on the planks of Page.

St. Lawrence University, with cam— '
pus at Canton, St. Lawrence County,
New York, has long enjoyed a repu-
tation as the largest and one of the
most inﬂuential universities in north—
ern New York. For years it has con-
sistently turned out a team that has
been the envy of coaches throughout
northeastern United States. Among
the top—notch outﬁts on the slate for
the Larries this season are Syracuse,
Dartmouth, Cortland and Springﬁeld,
to mention a few of the more out—
standing.

No less worthy a rival will be
Clarkson, numbered among the
nation’s top-ranking technical ill-
stitutlons, with test tubes, pulleys,
et a1 nailed down at Potsdam, N.Y.
It will be fresh from a contest with
Syracuse’s Saltinc Warriors that
Clarkson will invade State on De-
cembcr 9, sprinkling the dust of
Archbold Gym over the humble
boards of Page.

Brieﬂy stated, the new additions
to the State schedule will see the
locals squaring off with teams which
regularly meet such formidable foes
as Syracuse, Dartmouth, and other
outﬁts of equal calibre.

Hitler HelpsI

Side by side with its staunch ally,
Adolf Hitler, did MAA arrange for
the St. Lawrence and Clarkson con-
tests, making free use of the German
military machine in the task; and
thereby hangs an intriguing tale,
with no reflections, of course, upon
the political sentiments of the good
Council members.

It seems that sometime last year
Mr. Hitler decided to stretch a bit,
and in so doing incurred the wrath
of our Canadian neighbors, who
promptly declared war. Now it also
seems that there is an infallible
principle of warfare to the effect
that men help out a lot. With this
in mind, the Canadian government
this year issued a sweeping procla—
mation cancelling all athletic con-
tests contractcd for by Canadian
colleges and universities in an effort
to conserve tllc energy for national
defense.

St. Lawrence and Clarkson ordi-
narily book a number of Canadian
games, games which have since he-
come gaps in their respective sched-
ules. From these gaps the State
mccts have been arranged.

This docs not llllply limit the now
rivals arc to be nlcl'cly temporary
ones. Negotiations are already under
way for return bookings in 1041-42.

his qualifications as having had to
run four miles from school to home
every day in order to be in time for
supper!

The policy of the captains this
year will be to run all aspirants in
the various contests. However, only
the first five who finish will be
included in the scoring.

Tomorrow’s Lineup

Representing the Purple and Gold
tomorrow will be Bill Miller, Ben
Reed, Van Schulze, Phil Murphy,
Bill Tucker, Red O’Lcary, Frank
Bishop and Bob Christensen, fresh-
men. From the upper deck We have
Captain Gene Agnello, Jim Snov—
or, Jim Portley, and Frank Han—
sen.

The next. run will take place on
October 19 at Delhi. The date for
the St. Lawrence meet at Canton
is still indefinite.

The State mercuries have met
Morrisville twice in the past two
years, but have suffered defeat on
both occasions. This gives the locals
an added incentive to come out vic-
torious.

First time trials of the year were
held yesterday afternoon when the
boys were clocked in their practice

Fall Intramural Tennis
Tournament Play Begin:

The intramural tennis tourna-
ment appears destined to lag on in-
to the spring again. With winter
closing in, very few matches have
been played.

The tournament, however, has
started and that is something. The
feature match saw Bernhardt upset
Jones, former Cortland star, 7-5,
4-6, 7-5. Les Gerdts entered the
second round with an easy 6-3, 6-3
victory over Jack Adams. Keeping
him company were Carr, who de-
feated Soderlind 4-6, 6-2, 6-0, and
Reynolds, Stone and Manley. These
three won by default.
