A sharp new interest in world
affairs was dramatically illustrated
this week when nearly two hundred
students registered for the first
meeting; of the Forum of, Politics.
Miss Janet Sharts, '41, speaker of
the group appoint ed William
Brophy chairman of the all im-
portant Resolutions Committee,
which will integrate the work of
the Forum with that of the social
studies classes of the college.

Miss Alice Abelove, ’41. will direct
the second presidential election poll,
as a comparison with last year’s
straw vote. At that time, it will be
remembered, Roosevelt defeated pos-
sible candidate Dewey; Wendell
Wilikie received not one vote. The
project that promises to arouse the

 

most interest will be the work of I

“Poly” Fears State Women;

»~ Tells Frosh

“Go In Groups”

 

 

Up on a hill in Troy, there dwells

a group of boys intent on becoming
engineers. Taken all together, they
constitute the student body of the
Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute.
Among these boys there are several
ambitious young gentlemen who
gather once a week to publish the
chsseiccr Polytechnic, RPI’s
newspaper. And thereby hangs a
tale. . .
Last week the Polytechnic print-
ed a column of‘ advice to its
freshman class. In that column was
included the suggestionthat those
of RPI's men who seek "association
with the fairer sex" would do well
to come to “Albany State"-—State
College in other words. After this,
they cautioned their readers in the
following words:

"Expeditions to Albany State
should be made in a group as the
individual is likely to be mobbed.
You see—State's women are rather
in favor of variety too, and any
little bit is pounced upon."

As this reader looks back on the
above statement with a jaundiced
eye. the only part of it that seems
to have any semblance of truth is
the phrase referring to the RP!
boys as "any little bit."

It must be admitted. however,
that it's nice to know these things.
The next time that we see a large

group of women gathered about a
man in the college halls. we'll in-
stantly know that he goes to RPI.
The next time we see a bunch of
strange-looking young men ap-
proaching the college buildings, we'll
know that they come from RPI and
that they come in a group to protect
themselves from the onrush of the
thrilled State women who will be
sure to gather as soon as they are
seen within the college. Yes sir, the
next time, we'll know.

It is evident that the boys on the
hill haven't quite got things straight.
They expect a royal Welcome. In the
interests of hospitality, something
should be done to secure for the next
group of arrivals from RPI the wet-
come that the boys think they do-
scrve. The women of State should
steel themseIVcs to face the ordeal,
and try their best to make our visi-
tors fch as they were wclcomc—~-cvcn
though it may be a hard task.

Or maybe the women should act
as their conunon sense dictates. and
ignore the engineers.

State College Men, Faculty
Register Wednesday tor Dralt

 

 

Men Depart —Women Work
As Last War Upset Campus

 

 

Wednesday all the men in State
College who have passed their
twenty-first birthday and who have
yet to reach their thirty-sixth will
register for a selective plan of mili-
tary duty that is designed to train
the largest peace-time army that
America has chr had. This day
cannot help but call to mind those
days well within the memory of some
of the faculty when State College
men registered to form another
gigantic army for America—a war-
time one.

The days of the first World War
were rare ones in the history of the
college. Students and faculty disap-
peared to Join some branch of
Uncle Sam's fighting forces; women
students sewed bandages for the Red
Cross in Huesth Hail; the college
organizations, faculty. and student
body Joined to subscribe almost
$11000 to the Liberty Loans in 1917;
and eventually a training camp was
established on the campus—on the
spot where Milne and Page Hall
now stand.

Voluntary Training Proposed

The war fever reached State be-
fore conscription dnring thOSe days
,in 1917. In March of that year a
‘movemcnt was started under the
sponsorship of the late Dr. Abram
R. Brubachcr, then president of the
college, to bring to the campus a
voluntary student training corps.
The federal government offered to
send an officer to train a company
provided that 100 men enlisted and
the training was included in the
curriculum.

Before anything further could be
done about this, America entered
the war. and such plans were forgot-
ten in the general conscription.

Immediately after the entry of
the United States into the war,
President Brubachcr announced that
all men who enlisted for service
would be given their degree imme-
diately if they were seniors, and
would not lose their standing if they
were under-graduates. This an-

ural excitement caused by the coun-
try‘s being at war. caused an instant
effect. By the end of the school year,
thirteen members of the school had
volunteered, and had left school.
Among these volunteers was the first
lCditor-in-Chtcf of the S'M'rn Col.-
t.t~:tu-: News, Alfred E. Dedickc.

Over the summer vacation of 1017,
many men entered the army. The
first issue of the News to be pub-
lished in the fall of 101"] lists thirty-

rounds the details of local registra-
tion.

The Forum also announced that
the isllcclion i‘oil Committee under
the chairmanship of Alice Abclovc,
"it, will takc a comprehensive poll
of the presidential campaign in an
assembly program of the near future.
.iunot Shorts. "it, speaker of Forum.

manship of Ruth [arson and ltosc

for a mock political rally which will
be the Forum's first. social affair of
the year. Since all members of the

nouncemcnt, coupled with the nat- In

two students, alumni, and faculty
members who were in the army.
These names were listed in a column
which was for a time made a regular
feature of the paper. It was called
the “Honor Roll."

War Influence Increases

It is interesting to notice that
at this time the war note began to
creep into everything. Words and
phrases such as “enlist,” "Don't be a
slacker”, “over the top" Were used
in everything including appeals to
pay the student tax ($5.00), to join
the chorus (the chorus needed more
women because so many men had
left for the army that those re-
maining could not give the ensemble
enough volume), in editorials, and
in every phase of college life.
This quotation, speaking of the
duty of the teacher toward his pupils
may serve as an example:

"There is a twofold obligation on
the part of the teacher. First. it is
essential that we defend the intel-
lectual frontier of our democracy.
We must ‘dig ourselves into’ their
trenches and hold them” . . .

The war dominated all activity.

Women Fill Campus

Opportunities were not lacking for
the women of the college who
wanted to serve. A sewing room was
established in the basement of
Hucsted Hall where women might go
and sew bandages to be used over-
seas by the Red Cross.

The absence of men from the
campus began to make itself felt.
The two fraternities then in exist-
cncc closed their houses because
there were not enough men left to
support them. And the News was
able to say one November day in
1017 the following:

“Last spring when President Wil-
son‘s call for volunteers stripped
State College of nearly all its men,
everyone called it the quietest fe-
male seminary in existence. Since
then more men have gone to camp.
From time to time, more will
to ' ' . ‘H

Also notable is the fact that by
this time war temper had risen so
much. that a week after the above
quotation P r e s i d c n t Brubacher
made a speech in which he said:

"From our midst have gone some
thirty choice young men to defend
the principles of free government,
government by consent of the gov-
crncd; to redress the wrongs of
weak nations; to defend womanhood

Various conjectures have
been put forth as to the iden-

which made its appearance in
the Commons on Monday

A freshman, wise in years.
ventured the opinion that. it
was a popcorn machine. but
he couldn't find a slot to put

Sophomore guessed that it was
a scale which collect out. the

not so wise, theorized that it

ing from the jittcrbugging.

Board Created;
Will Register

Training Delarment Till .IuIy
Ollarad to College Men
Chosen Ior Conscription

For the second time in its history,
State College finds itself affected by
a national conscription plan. Not
since the days of the World War
have the faculty and students found
themselves in a position where they
are subject to call to serve in the
armed forces of the United States.
Wednesday, the 16th of October,
more than 1’75 students and 13
members of the faculty will register
in accordance with the provisions of
the Selective Service Plan of Regis-
tration. These men, who fall within
the 21-35 age limits, will be subject
to the draft.

Registration Aid

To aid the registration of non-resi-
dents among the college students, a
board of registrants has been ap-
pointed by John M. Saylcs, president
of the college. Included on this board
are Dr. Ralph A. Beaver, Dr. Howard
A. Dobell, Dr. Oscar Lanford and Dr.
Robert Rienow. The board will serve
to register those members of the stu-
dent body who are not residents of
the Capital District. Commuters and
Albany boys who fall under the pro-
visions of the act will register at their
regular registration booths. The
board expects to handle the registra-
tion of l30 men.

Students' Training Deferred
Especially important to college
men is the announcement that stu-
dents whose numbers are drawn in
the draft will be given an opportu-
nity to ask that their training be de-
ferred until July 1, 1941. This will
afford men an opportunity to com-
plete their college year before their
training is begun. At the end of this
year, however, all those who received
such deferment will be required to
receive their training at that time.
It is regarded highly improbable
that exemptions will be given to col-
lege men. The only men who will
receive exemptions are those with
dependents and those who are en-
gaged in essential occupations.

Faculty Also Affected

It seems highly probable at this
time that the draft will affect the
faculty of State College. Fourteen
members of the faculty are eligible
for conscription. They are Wilfred
P. Allard, Charles L. Andrews. Ralph
H. Baker, Paul G. Bulgcr, Edward L.
Cooper. William G. Hardy. Louis C.
Jones, Thomas Kinscllu, Oscar Lan-
ford, Robert Rienow. Warren Dens-
more. Henry L. Sick. Daniel W.
Sunder. and Wallace Taylor. It is
thought that the professions of
these men will not constitute suffi-
cicnt reason to exempt them. The
only cxempiions that will be made
among them will be because of any
dependents that. they might have.

 

Absentee Voting

All voters of State College, resid-
ing in n non~pcrsonal district may
