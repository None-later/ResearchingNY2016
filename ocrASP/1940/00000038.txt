down to the Ten Eyck Hotel on
November. 1, to help make the
Senior Hop an outstanding social
event of the current season.

The,,sc”ene will be the ballroom of
thenTen Eyck. This is especially ap-
propriate as the ballroom has been
recently redecorated in red and
white, colors of the class of ’41.

The selection of Harder Downing
from a large number of available
orchestras was an extremely diffi-
cult choice of the music committee.
The orchestra, which is very well
known. played this summer at
Sylyan Beach, the Playground of
Central New York. “Danceland” the
recently renovated dance pavilion at
the beach, has been hiring top-
flight orchestras to build up pres-
tige, among these being Paul White-
man, Jimmy Dorsey, Orrin Tucker,
Ozzie Nelson, Tony Martin, Glen
Miller, and Harder Downing. As
a further indication of Downing's
superiority we quote Len Kowalsky,
'40. who needs no further introduc-
tion: “I danced to the music of
Harder Downing all summer at Syl-
van Beach, and it gives me the
greatest pleasure to inform the
students of State College that they
are in for an evening of grand en-
tertainment with a very, very
smooth band.”

Downing has been featured at the
big dances of many of the colleges of
the East, including Colgate, Harvard,
and Hamilton.

The band, which is composed of
12 men, features the piano selections

Downing is noted as a sweet swing

It has been rumored that the band

excluding, of course, the Alma Mater

ernor. In 1928, State chose two Re-
publicans again. Picking Herbert
Hoover over Al Smith and Albert
Ottinger over Franklin D. Roosevelt
in the gubernatorial elections, State
again found itself wrong as Roose-
velt was elected over his Republi-
can opponent. In 1932, the State
voters picked Hoover to win over
Roosevelt by a 2 to 1 vote. Roosevelt
won in a landslide vote.

Student Guess Correct

In 1936, the student body guessed
correctly in the presidential election,
picking Roosevelt over Landon by a
415 to 401 vote. The fact is notable,
however, that although State picked
Roosevelt to win by a bare plur-
ality, in the national elections of
that year Roosevelt won by an un-
precedentedly large one.

Two facts are readily apparent:
the fact that State is traditionally
Republican, and that elections at
State must be viewed in a more
normal political coloring before they
can be interpreted. On this basis,
and on the evidence afforded by
the past votes, it would seem that
the Willkie victory with such a
close margin could well indicate a
Roosevelt victory in November in
New York State and consequently
in the nation. This conclusion is ar-
rived at through the observation
that State straw votes have almost
invariably acted as negative baro-
meters in state elections.

Roosevelt In 1936

In 1936, State gave the election to
Roosevelt over Landon, 415 votes
to 401. The figures returned by the
electorate made Roosevelt president
by a plurality of about 16,000,000
votes. Thus it would seem that
State's action in electing Willkie over
Roosevelt, 282 to 205, can be inter-
preted as forecasting a Roosevelt
plurality of about 8,000,000 votes in
November.

Chairman Grattan, to each of the
spokesmen.

SCA to Attend
Colgate Parley

Dean Delaney has been appoint~
ed State’s faculty representative to
a committee which will consider aid
to student refugees from China and
Europe. The committee will meet at
Colgate University on November 13.

Several members of SCA will also
attend the annual New York State
Intercollegiate Conference at 001-
gate. This conference is open to all
students connected with religious
organizations in New York State
Colleges. Robert Agne, '41, SCA Presl-
dcnt, feels that due to the critical
situation in Europe another such
conference may be impossible.
Therefore he says that special at-
tention should be given to the speak-
ers who will be part of the program
at Colgate.

Especially outstanding is Robert
C. Mackle, recently from Geneva,
Switzerland, who is general secre-
tory of the World's Student Chris—
tian Federation. His topic will con-
cern the plight of students in
Europe and China and our response.

Engineers for Willkie,
Back Choice of State

For once State and RPI agree
—they both prefer elephants to
donkeys. For RPI has also named
Willkie as its choice in the com-
ing Presidential election.

Yet at RPI Willkie was the
favorite by a 3-1 majority, while
at State he topped the race by
only 17 votes. This indicates that
although both institutions are
traditionally Republican, the
Democrats at State have a much
larger minority. Also this would
seem to indicate that the Engin-
eers are more conservative than
State students.

Dean’s List on Page 4
of this issue.

 

 

 

Dr. Milton G. Nelson, dean of the
college, has announced the names of
110 State College students who main-
tained at least a B average for both
semesters of the 1939-1940 school
year and thus earned a place on the
dean’s list. The total number repre-
sents a net decrease of 18 from last
year's total, when the policy of a
list compiled from both semesters
was inaugurated.

Compare Lists

The number of students to earn
a place on the dean’s list for any
one semester hit a high of 230 in
November 1938, over 20 per cent of
the student body maintaining the
necessary average, and it was at this
time that Dr. Nelson announced
that the dean’s list would be com-
piled thereafter from students able
to secure a B average both semes-
ters. The number dropped to 128
when the first list operating under
the new policy was inaugurated and
took another drop to 110 this year.
Dr. Nelson declined to make any
comment about the list other than
pointing out that the new policy
served to restrict the number. make
it more difficult to earn a place on
the list. and therefore served to
make it more of an honor. “Appar-

Vanderzee Announces Selection
Of President Must Await
Action by Legislature

 

State College must wait at least
until April for an announcement of
its new president. Dr. John M. Sayles
will continue as Acting President
until that time. So said Mr. New-
ton B. Vanderzee in a statement to
the STATE COLLEGE News Monday.

Legislative Action

According to Mr. Vanderzee, chair-
man of the Board of Visitors, the
selection of a new president must
await legislative action to be intro-
duced at the 1941 session. This will
delay the selection of a new execu-
tive officer for the college till
spring.

The Regents of the University of
the State of New York discussed
the selection of a successor to the
late Dr. Brubacher with our Board
of Visitors at a joint meeting last
week. It was decided then to await
legislative action. Presidents of this
college are selected by the Board of
Regents acting on nominations of
the Board of Visitors.

According to Mr. Robert Whelan,
of the Board of Visitors, there exists
no legal disqualifications for con-
sideration of individuals already on
the college faculty.

Acting President

Dr. Sayles was first named Act-
ing President in September of 1939.
He succeeded Dr. Nelson who served
in the capacity of acting president
throughout the summer of 1939.

Members of our Board of Visitors
are: Newton B. Vanderzee, Selkirk,
chairman; Robert E. Whalen, Al-
bany; William H. Anderson, Troy;
Dorothy A. Cogswell, Loudonville;
Ella S. Cameron. Albany; Frederick
McDonald, Albany; and Edward R.

(Continued on page 1,, column 1,)

The publication last week of the
results of the Hirsh-Kunz election
has revived the issue which was
brought up in assembly last year—-
the issue concerning the publication
of the numerical results of all elec-
tions.

On the trail of a story, the roving
reporter accosted all the people
whose names Were published last
Week together with the votes that
each had received.

"What do you think about pub-
lishing the results?" all Were asked,
one by one.

lesh said. “I like the Idea. It’s
good to know by how many you
win or lose—even if you win by as
little as I did."

Kunz's answer was, “Publish
them. by all means. I feel better
now that I know that I didn’t lose
by much. than I would if I didn't
know by how many votes I had lost."

Ryerson answered, “Sure, you
ought to publish them. It never hurt
anyone to know right where he
stands whenever he runs for office.”

Cox replied, “Certainly you ought
to publish the results. The student
body has a right to know how its
votes Ware cast."

Novelli told us. "I'm very much in
favor of publishing the reports. Dis-

body can’t win an election, and most
people never run anyway."

Ritchie laughineg anSWered, “If
anyone in the school would be op-
posed to the publication of the re-
sults, I imagine that I’m the one.
I’m in favor of it, though. It’s good
democratic procedure. I vote yes.”

This set of answers convinced the
reporter that the candidates in this
election at least were very much in
favor of having the results of elec-
tions posted.

It is curious to note that State
is one of the few colleges in the
country which keeps its election re-
sults Secret.

Last year. Mary Jane McKay,
president of NSFA, told the News
that the great majority of American
colleges make a practice of posting
the numerical results of all elec-
tions in the college. Miss McKay
wrote in part:

“The practice of posting the re-
sults of elections in colleges has been
borrowed, I suppose. from our civic
life where all election results are
posted for the public to see. I should
think that the normal curiosity of
your student body would demand
that they be ‘in on the know'
. . . . In a highly democratic proce«
dure. there does not seem to be
much point in keeping election re-
turns secret."
