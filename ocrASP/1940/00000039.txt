The Vanishing Pedagogue

He soundly declared that good teachers and
not extravagant buildings were the prime essen-
tial . . . In view of the fact that placements by
college teacher-training departments have not
been easy in recent years, it would seem that
the supply of properly trained teachers is not
outrunning the demand. And with school pupil
enrollment definitely going down. the demand
is not likely to increase.

The above statement is quoted from an editorial
appearing in Monday night’s Knickerbocker News.
It is attributed to Dr. Ernest Cole, recently installed
Commissioner of New York State Education.

The implication of such a statement to teachers
in a teacher-training institution is evident. Too
many students are being graduated and certiﬁed
for jobs which do not exist.

Fortunately, the situation is not quite as serious
as it first seems. It is true that pupil enrollments
are decreasing. But the period of schooling has
also increased. The problem of over-crowding in
the profession has been met partially by an exten-
sion of the training period to five years. The recent
Selective Service Act should create a slight demand
in the teacher market.

Prepared as we are at State College for a fifth
year. the situation here is even more favorable.
Certain of the “marginal schools of education”
which colleges of this state now operate as “side-
lines” will inevitably be “forced out” by the fifth
year requirement. At present State College has
a placement record which compares more than favor-
ably with those of its competitors. Future place-
ment records will more solidly establish the New
York State College for Teachers as the state’s out-
standing teacher-training institution.

Admission by " Invitation”

l'nhiiIdI-n Kilt‘hibt
.\re often wr-lI-oIm-Ht when they are gone.

Shakespeare, 1 Henry VI

it cannot be said that State College is inhospit-
able. On the contrary, the college and student body
“fall over backwards" in attempts to make guests
and visitors feel at home. This applies, however,
only to "the invited".

The appearance of large numbers of men from
nearby colleges was pleasantwwhen it began. Now
these “visits” have assumed the proportions of an
influx.

it was also very pleasant to see an unusual mun-
bcr of outsiders at our Campus Day festivities.
Everyone was welcome to attend the coronation and
stunts. Everyone was not welcome to attend the
dancing which followed. Like the relative who
came to stay overnight and brought his trunk, our
friends in the mad whirl of education overstayed
their invitations.

Outsiders are not wanted at noon-time dancing
because the (fonnnons is too small. They are not
wanted at evening functions inasmuch as these are
essentially S'I‘A'l‘l'l functions. Stallions to those

To the Student Body:

During the past years much has been said and printed
about the Activities Office “hangers-on"Arethosc people who.
although they are without official bus'ness. s" "rd most of their
time there, and are found in the office in greater numbers
than the people who actually work on one of tha publications.
Although much has been said. nothing has been done.

The situation. if such it may be termed. has grown worse.
This year. even more people than in previous years are making

a habit of frequenting the office.

.\t times there are so many

pople in the room that one who actually wishes to work finds

it impossible to do so.

The Commentstater

The performance of a very small minority of the
sophomore class in last Friday’s assembly aroused

' ccmments which ranged from approval to disgust with

more students subscribing to the latter. The idea that

‘-"‘he power of the press is apparently unlimited re-

ceived ample support—the News published a column
decrying the lack of interest and a situation of social
stagnation. a few sophomores read the column, it
sinks in. and lo and behold—the State College student
asssciatlon undergoes the most hectic occurrence in
years! The occurrence of last Friday was burlesque—-
burlesque because the group of a dozen or more sopho-
mzre men copied the act of the Class of 1942 which
happened two years ago—namely the appearance of
Merrill Walrath. clad in a scant pair of diapers amid

a trumpet fanfare—and went it one better (or worse).

by locking the freshmen class in the balcony.

No mention was made of the fact that one of the
freshmen bounced unclad onto the Page hall stage suf-
fered an injury to his head—that is considered a part
of unorganized rivalry, as much a part as depantsing,
showering. and abduction. The act which caused the
commotion was the “apparent disregard for the laws of
the United States of America. the State of New York,
and the City of Albany with special disregard for the
fire hum of the City of Albany. an own not of poor

citizenship.” Concerning the breaking of
Fire fire laws. 9. paragraph is reprinted from
Bazard last week's issue of the STATE Coccaon N aws
Cited in which appeared a communication dc-

fending the putting of chairs in the aisles
and other ﬁre law violations which occured at the
Cornelia Otis Skinner performance as follows: “It is
true that fire laws were broken on this occasion but
since they have been broken consistently on Gradua-
tion and Moving-Up Day by people in higher authority,
we fail to see why criticism should fall on us.”

The freshman class was imprisoned from only two
exits. the two at the rear of the orchestra. Avenues
of escape were still available via the “panic doors” on
oi her ride of the balcony which open out when any
‘ZI'EE‘SUI'E is applied. A good percentage of the student
body are not even cognizant of their existence.

Thus—we may lay the comments of disgust to only
one source. the fact that the Student Association is
willing to tolerate unorganized rivalry up to a certain
point and will tolerate it only when they are in the
mood for rowdiness. They were not in such a mood
and the small group must have overdone it for the
association was not willing to tolerate the unorgan—
ized rivalry as carried on last Friday.

The fire law situation brings to mind
Fire another point which has long been over-
I)rill looked by the student association. New
Feasible York State makes it mandatory that each
high school conduct at least twelve fire
drills during the school year. State College, which for
a long time has recognized the fire hazard created
nvery time, an audience of any size enters Page Hall,
has neglected to even mention the exits in case of fire
from Page Hall. let alone conduct a fire drill. The
Student Association will render a valuable service to
itself by taking ten minutes from one of its Friday
assemblies and running through the routine of a fire
drill.

Such a fire drill would not be difficult to conduct.
A school of one thousand students can be emptied
in less than four minutes under the supervision of a
small faculty group. With the class marshals super-
vising the drill and simple. complete instructions read
by Merrill Walrath. cooperation of the student body
would result in a fast. valuable. necessary fire drill.
True. Page Hall is supposedly fire-proof, but the Ti-
tanic was also sink-proof. State College students are
not in danger of being burned so much as they are of
being trampled. and a ten minute fire drill once a
year (or more often if possible) would alleviate this
condition permanently.

HEN THE STATE barriers

dropped their second run of the
season to Delhi last Saturday. it was
the tenth consecutive loss that local
squads have suffered during the past
four years' trots.

Only members of the present sen—
ior class could possibly recall the
last State cross-country victory. and
the ones who actually remember are
without doubt few and far between.
The historic date when Purple and
Gold runners last tasted victory fell
on October 30. 1937. almost three
years ago to the day. Tony Wilczyn-
ski. Frank Rickman. and Harold
Haynes were the boys who led the
State herd to a win that afternoon
over Bard. The feat of that after-
noon of the already dimming past
has not been repeated in three years
of cross-country competition.

In addition to our puny cross-
country record. and perhaps hi part
a result of it. is the fact that the
student body has shown little inter-
est im the team. The Association on

finance their runs; the students

KDR Victorious,-
AII-Star Teams

McCTeaTy Unamious Choice of
Team Captains Voting for
First String Position

After Kappa Delta Rho had
clnched the title by defeating SLS
29-0. the captains of the intramural
touch football teams selected seven
men Wednesday as an all-star
squad. Roy McCreary of KDR was
the only unanimous choice. while
Herb Oksala and Pinky Bull were
the only repeaters from the ‘39 all-
‘tars.

McCreary was the triple threat
whose puntlng, passing. and running
carried the powerful KDR unit to
their third straight victory. Butch
Feigenbaum. KB captain. was wisely
chosen for his blocking ability and
his bulldog defensive play. Hank
Brauner, also of KB. won his back-
field post for his passing and block-
ing ability. Dickson, another triple;
tin-eater. and Griffin. a fine man at
any position. both from Potter Club.
add strength to this array.

Tie For Center
Although both Bull and Feigen~

voting. Brophy. a first stringer lastl

have received little in return.

Cross country devotees may at—
tack this siaicment with the con-
tention that the blame lies with the
students if the latter show no in—
terest in the team‘s activities. To
this we say that cross country is not
a spectator‘s sport. Even a winning
barrier outfit is no great source oft
attraction from the spectator stand- l
point.

In the light of these facts, does it
not seem logicle that a sport which
will give the people who pay a break
should be substituted as State's
principal fall athletic activity? And
since intercollegiate football is out of
the question. wouldn't soccer fill
the bill fairly well?

Soccer will be more expensive; we
think it‘s; worth it. It will take time
and hard work to produce a winning
team. We think must will agree.
however. that it‘s a lot more fun
from the spectators angle to watch
a losing soccer team in action than
a winning cross country fleet. And
we don't even have the latter! ! !

In review. we might say that KDR

Sephomores Beat, Imprison
Freshmen as Rivalry Begins

 

Rivalry—organized and unorgan-
ized—started last Friday between the
freshmen and sophomores. Organized
rivalry proceeded according to tra-
dition. with the sophomores soundly
walloping the frosh. Unorganized
rivalry contributed the most hectic
Student Assembly to be seen in Page
Hall in two years.

Friday afternoon. the fresh and
the sophomores met in the tradi-
tional pushball contest—and the
sophomores administered the tradi-
tional heating to the frosh. The
game took ten minutes to play. and
in that time the sophomores man-
aged to roll up 66 points. while keep-
ing the fresh from scoring at all. It
was the worst beating in recent his-
tory.

On Saturday afternoon. the repre-
sentatives of the two classes again
met. The results were again disas~
trous to the fresh. They lost the
football game, 26 to 0. In the girls’
events. they lost the sack race and
the three-legged race. To save their
class from complete defeat. the frosh
women won the obstacle race. Riv-
alry score: 7 to 1.

It was unorganized rivalry
provided
however. Last Thursday night. the

boys of the two lower classes got
tangled up in some sort of a pantiess
party. Both classes vowed revenge.
Friday morning in assembly, the
groups of fresh and soph men who
were roaming around obviously look-
ing for trouble made it evident that
something was going to happen.
Happen it did—right in the middle
of the Local Talent show.

In the middle of a dance number.
the curtains parted. and two fresh-
men were thrown on the stage—you
know how. The roar which arose
throughout the auditorium was loud-
est in the balcony where the fresh-
man class sat. The freshman men
rose in a body and started down—
stairs to avenge their fellow-class-
mates. They were rather surprised
to find that all the doors to the
balcony were locked. and that they
were temporary prisoners.

After Dean Nelson had in a speech
requested that the keys to the locks
be brought forth, the doors were
opened. and the fresh were released.
The assembly ended on the note of
general confusion that had prevailed

Further developments are being
awaited eagerly by the entire school.

Despite predictions of a victorious
outcome, the State College cinder
squad dropped their meet with Delhi
last Saturday to the tune of 38-22.
This makes the score a perfect
triple-zero for the Purple and Gold
color-bearers.

Delhi Man First

Delhi's Dan Barley set the pace
over their difficult course and crossed
the finish line in 16:12 for a 2.6 mile
run. State's able captain, Eugene
Agnello, came in third just 12 sec-
onds behind Burley. Taking fifth
stall honors for State was yearling
Verne Marshall who made the dash
in 16:52. Hansen took the seven-
spot in 17:20. He was followed by
Bill Miller who finished in the
money despite a knee injury sus-
tained when he slipped on a newly-
fertilized cow pasture. Demmlck
placed 10th. being the fifth State
man to finish in the top ten. His
time was 18 flat. Despite the handi-
cap of an early snow Agnello lead
the pack most of the way.
