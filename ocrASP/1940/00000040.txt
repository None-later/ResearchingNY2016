STAI'E COLLEGE NEVIS, FRIDAY, OCTOBER 25, 1940

'39-'40 ' Dean's List

 

7 Begin Reforms Class of on

 

A new regime has begun! The
Grand Grand Central Terminal off
the lower corridor of Draper is no
more. The heads of the six activi-
ties located in the Publications Of-
fice have banded together in com-
mon defense against the interlopers
who have made it impossible to
accomplish anything in the office
at any time.

They have appointed a Publica-

power to set up and enforce any
regulations necessary to maintain a
good working atmosphere in the
Publications Office. The response
from the Student Body has been

good.

Now that these new regulations
(printed on page 2) are known to
the student body there exists no ex-
cuse for non-cooperation. Penalties
for violations will be set up and ad-
ministered by the heads of the ac-
tivlties.

Undoubtedly the new arrangement
will inconvenience the students who
have made a habit of frequenting the
Publications Office, but the advan-
tages gained by the workers on the
several publications are expected to
more than outweigh any inconven-
ience suffered by the people who
have no work to do in the office.

 

Jordan, Agne Stage
Satire, Comedy Duo

Advanced Dramatics will again
present two plays on the stage of the
Page Hall auditorium on Tuesday
at 8:15. Harry Jordan and Robert
Agne, seniors, are the respective
producers of two satirical comedies.

Jordan's play is a modern version
of the old story of Helen of Troy.
It is one of a series of “somewhat”
historical plays. The cast includes
Dorothy McIsaac, Lauretta Serva-
tius, and Frank Evans, juniors; John
Witthoft. '43; Don Vanas.

The second comedy was both writ-
ten and directed by Agne, who also
is in the cast. Other characters are
played by Kay Wilson, Frank Cas—
sidy, and Tom George, Juniors;
George Kunz, ’43; Harold Ashwarth,
Bob White, and Joe Higgins, fresh—
men. ,

 

The Engineers Reply

Reprinted From Rensselaer Polytechnic

An article appearing in a past
issue of Polytechnic has incited our
collegues of the STATE Cormsce News
to editorialize upon the actions of
the precocious children at Rensse-
laer.

Gentlemen. we are treading upon
holy ground whenever we cross the
threshold of a State dormitory. We
are immature, conceited individuals
who are to be treated with clemency
(in order to avert the frustration of
youth) by pedagogues well versed in
child psychology, and the care and
handling of illiterate children.

They ridicule us because we ml-
grate to their campus in groups.
Perhaps the esteemed editors of the
News forgot their lessons in mass
psychology, and in so doing fail to
realize that our only object in such
a movement is to enhance the wel-
come that we so richly deserve.

We are not placing ourselves
among the unattainable stars when
We say that we at Rensselaer are a
body of unaffected individuals, con-
gregated here with the only inten-
tion of pursuing an engineering
education. Occasionally we may
wander from the path. Any state-
ment accusing us of laboring under
illusions of grandeur is a conclusion

eat. sleep, or just wile away time

dent Association. has announced

traditional freshman sing where-
in thc freshmen wore to enter-
tain the rest of the students by

mater. “College of the Empire
State." and the chain-gang pres-
entatlon of “Life is Very Differ-
ent." w.s suddenly cancelled

Bulger, Smith
Attend Parley

Syracuse Scene of Convention
of Principals, Board Heads;
Cole Addresses Group

Dr. C. Currien Smith and Paul
Bulger, acting assistant principal of
Millie High School. represented State
College at the eighth annual meet-
ing of the New York State School
Boards Association, October 27, 28,
and 29 at Syracuse. More than eleven
hundred local principals and super-
intendents attended the meeting.

Dr. Ernest E. Cole, Commissioner
of Education and President of the
University of the State of New York,
was the principal speaker. Other
speakers on the program were Dr. J.
Caycc Morrison, assistant Commis-
sioner of the State Education De-
partment, Dr. W. Howard Pillsbury,
superintendent of schools of Sche-
nectady, and Dr. Hu Shlh. Chinese
Ambassador to the United States.

Bulgcr Comments

Bulger, in commenting on the con-
vention, expressed his astonishment
at the voluntary attendance of sueh
a large number of local educators.
Said Bulger, “The ﬁrst thing that
impressed me was that such a num-
ber of people would sacrifice so much
of their time solely because of their
interest in education".

In his capacity as Director of the
Student Employment Bureau. Bul-
ger found it an unusually good op~
portunlty to cultivate the acquaint-
ance of school board members
throughout the state.

Cole Stresses Home Rule

Dr. Cole in his address to the con-
vention. emphasized decentralization
of the state‘s school system. He
stressed “home rule” in education
for the state's municipalities.

Instead of speaking on condi-
tions in China today. Dr. Shih pre-
sented a talk on New York State
influence on the Chinese Renais-
sance.

 

Myskania Announces

Resolved that on the conclusion of all Student Association and
class elections, the numerical results of such elections. and rcvotcs
incidental thereto shall be posted. The numerical results of elec-
tions for Campus Queen, Prom Queen. and Myskunla nominations

shall not be posted.

in reply to a request for an interpretation of this rcsolution’s
cons!itutionzilily, Myskunia rules as follows:

inasmuch us Article l\' of llli‘ Constitution] vcsls “all legisla-
tivc power in the assembly of the Association,” and sincc the
purpose as outlined in Article ii is "the munngcmcut of all mat—
tcrs of student interest not academic in nature, it would seem
that in the absence of any specific prohibition that the Student
Association holds life and death power over the publication of
its election results. The Association may authorize the publica-
tion of its election rcsulis; it may forbid such publication; its
power over their publication is limitless. The resolution is there-

fore constitutional.

 

Political Forum
Sponsors Party

Students Will Hear Results
Oi Presidential Election
During Entertainment

State College students of all
political parties will gather in Page
Hall Gymnasium Tuesday night to
participate in an Election Watch
Party. celebrate Election day, listen
to the election returns as they are
broadcast over the radio, and dance
away an evening. The affair. spon-
sored by the Forum of Politics, will
commence immediately after the Ad-
vanced Dramatics weekly presenta-
tions.

Admission Fee 'l‘hrcc Cents

Students will be asked to pay a
very nominal admission fee of three
cents pills a few additional taxes
which bring the total to twenty-one
cents per person. Members of the
Forum are inclined to believe that
those students attending will be
made at least a little tax-conscious.

The tax list includes the follow-
ing: four cents for national defense,
two and one half cents federal, one
cent state. eleven cents county, and
a one-half cent p011 tax.

The Forum's party will present a
little of everything that the members
have decided should be part of an
election night celebration. An or-
chestra has been selected to provide
music for dancing. The State Col-
lege brass band will perform under
 direction of Charles Reynolds,
Satires 0n Program

Included on the program are a
number of plays and satires about
candidates and political parties. One
parody concerns itself with Hitler,
Stalin, and Mussolini. Three mem-
bers of the senior class will stage
this skit entitled “Three Little
Maids Are We."

Janet Sharts, president of the
Forum of Politics, busy with plans
for the political rally is general
chairman of the affair. “I believe
that the program has enough variety
and features to please any student
of State College no matter what
particular political party. he or she
may belong to," said Miss Shorts.
and the small admission fee will
allow the students to have a good
time while listening to the returns
of the election."

Service Fraternity
To Drop Delinquents

Paul Grattan. president, announc-
ed Wednesday that Service Fra-
ternity. the State College organiza-
tion composed of former Boy Scouts,
will undertake a major reorganiza-
tion. This step has been taken, Presi-
dent Grattan explained, because a
large proportion of the members of
the fraternity were not actively in-
terested in the work of the group.

The reorganization, which is in
charge of Robert Bunn, '42, aims to
eliminate the delinquent members of
the fraternity. to make it closer
knit. and more efficient. The group.
which was organized in 1939, now
has more than fifty members.

As soon as the reorganization has
been completed. the fraternity plans
to commence activities. Among the
first of the tasks to be undertaken
will be a surch of men's housing
i‘acilltics. This survey is to be taken
in cooperation with the office of the
Dean of Women.

in which one of the boys who fought
in the last war returns from the
dead. The second play, directed by
Vincent Miller, '42, is appropriate for
Tuesday night as it is a political
satire concerning election.

And 192, to be specific is Har—
old Fluster of 122 Dana Avenue,
Albany, State, ’39.

Yes, conscription is real.

At latest reports. the draftee
is doing as well as can be ex-
pected. In fact, he feels fine.

“A year’s vacation—a new uni-
form—and we've practically re-
served tickets for the Purdue—
F‘ordham game! Heck, why should
I be mad?" Fluster grinned.

He doesn't know yet when he
will be summoned by the authori-
ties oi‘ the Selective Service Act
to enter his year of training. In
fact, he doesn’t even know how
he'll look in a uniform, but Flus-
Lcr and his mother both agree a
year away from home should be
“good for me.”
