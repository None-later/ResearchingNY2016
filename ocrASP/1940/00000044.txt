. Survey to seek
Status of Jobs

Questionnaire Will Be Given
Students As They Enter
Morning's Assamny

In order to determine the exact
status of the student employment
situation at State College, a ques-
tionnaire will be handed to each
student before assembly today. The
questionnaire is being Jointly spon-
sored by the Part-Time Employ-
ment Bureau and the National
Youth Administration officials un-
der the supervision of the Dean of
Women.

Speculation life
There has been much specu-

lation throughout the college as to

the employment situation. It is be-
lieved the survey will give all parties
concerned an accurate cross-section
of the employment activities of State
students.

It is imperative that every stu-
dent in school fin out the question-
naue seriously and with thought
since the results will determine the
future policy of both the PTEB and
NYA. The information given will
remain confidential.

Each student will be asked his
name, age. and class. There will be
twenty-eight questions in the survey
and students will be asked in what
sort of work they are now engaged.
how much they work. and what
salary they receive. Those working
will be asked what percent of their
total expenses in college they have
earned.

To Question ‘Unempioyed

For those who do not work, ques-
tions will be asked about whether
they tried to find work, whether
they applied to the P'I‘EB or for
NYA aid, whether they were offered
jobs, and whether they accepted or
rejected them.

Questions as to hours, type of
work, wages, etc., will also be asked
about summer and vacation employ-
ment.

Questionnaires must be returned.
to the Dean of Women’s office by
Monday. There will be a basket there
to receive them.

Intercollegiate SCA

 

Board Will Choose
New NEWS Staff

The Nsws Board will convene
on Monday at 7:00 P. M. in the
library of Newman Hall.

The business of the meeting
will be the matter of personnel
choice for the coming year. The
staff positions under considera-
tion will include appointments to
the sports staff, the junior busi-
ness staff. the sophomore editor-
ial staff (desk editors). the soph-
omore sports staff, and the
sophomore business staff.

The choice of Sophomore Desk
Editors is perhaps the most in-
teresting because the group, of
from four to six, chosen to fill

these positions will include the
Editor or Co-Editors-in-chicf of
the N nws in 1943.

Appointments will appear in
Friday’s issue of the News.

F reshmen Serenade
In. Assembly Today

State frosh of today don’t have
to wear two-inch class buttons,
purple and gold skull-caps. or
placards proclaiming their latest
offense. Nope. times have changed
since 1928!

But—this year’s freshmen must
croon, melodiously and from
memory, our Alma Mater during
today’s assembly. Then the class
of ’44 will desert its heavenly
perch, descend to the ground
floor, and parade chain-gang
fashion up and down the isles
singing their theme song, “Life
Is Very Different.”

The upperclassmen will listen
carefully to the discordant seren-
ade; the sophomores in particu-
lar will be watching for ’44 speci-
mens who do not exhibit the
proper tonal range. enthusiasm.
or high-stepping.

This November sing is a fairly
recent tradition, being only five
years old, but the Black Legion
says that it is prepared to “err-
sure a correct performance from
the Class of '44."

Bulger Tours Schools

Paul Bulger. vice-principal of
Milne High School. left today on his

ger has planned an educative pro-
gram to inform schools of the work
that State College is doing. As he
travels through the various sections
of the state. he will visit alumni of
the college.

Each year Mr. Bulger takes in a
new district where our work as a

itinerary for this trip centers around
the Syracuse district. It is planned

Tuesday, November 12: Margaret—
vllle and Roxbury.

Wednesday, November 13: Clinton,
Sherrill, and Warner's.

DeLaney Solicits
Poll Cooperation

Passow Points Out 500 Replies
Paint Inaccurate Picture
Ol State Employment

Miss Sara Tod DeLaney, Dean of
Women, urged all students who fall-
ed to complete and return the ques-
tionnaire for the State College Em-
ployment Survey to do so immedi-
ately. The survey, conducted joint-
ly by the NYA desk and the State
College Employment Bureau, under
the supervision of the Dean of Wo-
men. is being made in attempt to
determine the exact status of em-
ployment at State College and serve
as a basis for the future operation
of the Part-Time Employment Bu-
reau.

Approximately 500 students or
one-half of the undergraduate body
cooperated with the survey personnel
and completed and returned the
questionnaire. “500 answers are not
enough to give us the accurate in-
formation we are seeking. Unless we
receive responses from at least 85%
or 90% of the undergraduate body.
We cannot possibly come to any
valid conclusion," said Harry Pas-

 

sow, director of the Part-Time Em-
ployment Bureau. “If students do
not cooperate and come to the office
for a blank if they failed to receive
one and return it immediately, it
will result in the loss of hours of
the office staff's time. It will necessi-
tate the sending out of individual
invitations to each student who fail-
ed to cooperate to come to the of-
fice and do so. We urge that stu-
dents cooperate and save us this
unnecessary work.”

A basket has been placed just out—
,side the entrance to the Dean of
Women's office. Completed question-
naires may be placed in this basket.
Students who have not received
questionnaires may get them on the
table just inside the door.

on its way, until it was impossible
to distinguish the banner within

SLS Holds Annual Fireman's
Ball !n Elsmere Tonight;
EEP Dances Tomorrow

Gadlin Bodner, ’41, president of
Interfraternity Council, announces
that freshmen fraternity bids will
be issued by the council Monday
morning in the Lounge of Richard-
son Hall. Freshmen will receive a
notice to report to the Lounge be-
fore 12:30 P. M. the same day, where
they will receive their bids.

All bids must be returned, ac-
cepted or rejected, to the Lounge be-
fore 12230 P. M., Monday, November
25. the day following Thanksgiving
vacation. No bids may then be is-
sued until the first day of next sem-
ester.

Interfraternlty Council was or-
ganized in 1936 by Kappa Delta
Rho and the Edward Eldred Potter
Club. In the spring of 1938, Kappa
Beta was admitted as the third
member of the council, and more
recently Sigma Lambda Sigma was
accepted as a fourth member. The
four offices of the council rotate
among the four fraternities.

220 Men Pledged

In the past five years 220 fresh-
men were pledged to State fraterni-
ties. The following tabulation shch
how they were distributed:

1935 1936 1937 1938 1939

Kl”! ............ .. 26 13 12 25

linppu Iii-in ., _ .. .. 8 11
SL5 .............. .. - - - 8 14

Total .......... .. 41 34 58 59

On the basis of the above tabula-
tion it can be seen that. although
comparatively new on the campus,
SLS was able to gain more pledges
last year than the older KDR. It
will be interesting to see whether
this trend will continue this year.

Potter Club pledged more men in
1939 than any single fraternity.
Looking back at the record, it would
seem that a decline one year would
indicate an increase the next. or
vice-verso. Will Potter Club keep
its lead this your? The trend would
indicate a decline.

Fraternities Growing

Fraternity spirit at State has been
growing. lllld every year sees an in-
crease in numbers. Lost your there
was it decrease in men's enrollment
in the college from 100 to 81, yet
the fraternities increased their corn-
blncd numbers.

Intcrfrntcrnlty Council for 1940-
1941 is composed of the following:
Kappa Bctu. Gildllll Bodner. presi-
dent, Arnold Ellcrin, seniors, and
Henry Brnuncr. ’42; Sigma Lambda
