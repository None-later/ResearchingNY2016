The STATE COLLEGE NEWS assumes no responsibility
for opinions expressed in its columns' or communionlions,
us such expressions do not necessarily l‘f‘llf‘i'f its view.

Man Bites Dog

The thorn in the cushion of the 1'lllltll‘llll I-IIuir.
— Thackeray

The STATE COLLEGE NEWS has a three-fold func-
tion. Its job is to record, prognosticate, and interpret
all which is connotcd by the phrase “State College”.
That task involves the answering of these three
questions:

1. What is news?

2. What news can be published within the nar-

row confmes of a four-page folio?

3. How shall the news thus selected be dis-

played?

What is news? Is it “Man Bites Dog"? Or is it
all that encompassed by the cryptogram N-orth,
E-ast, W-est, S-outh? In evaluating stories for
publication in this newspaper, the deﬁnition of
news as formulated by Charles A. Dana when editor
of the New York Sun is employed. That makes
news “anything which interests 21 large part of the
community and which has never been brought to
its attention.”

Like all newspapers, the NEWS each week gathers
roughly twice as much material as it can possibly
publish. Forced, arbitrarily, to evaluate the material
thus gathered, the News must discard almost half.
Such evaluation-~since it is a matter of personal
opinion—is necessarily highly controversial. In
making his selection, the editor is fully aware of
the offense felt by those individuals and organiza—
tions whose news is either minimized or excluded.

In general, the NEWS does not have space to re-
port routine extra—curricular and social activities.
Sheer physical necessity forces it to curtail evalua-
tions of stories concerning fraternities, sororities,
religious organizations, departmental clubs, and the
like. in most cases, this alleged “news” is or at least
should be known to the members and is rarely of
interest to outsidcs. The committees, decoration
scheme, and detailed comment on the orchestra
selected for a KUR barn-rush-dancc cannot qualify
as news in a paper of this size. But when the site
selected for such a dance burns down—as it did—
that is news. Advance listing of couples for Senior
Hop may be news to the gossip-monger, but space
limitations prohibit its publication. Conversely, a
story on the Dean's List without the actual listing
is of dubious value.

Once it is determined what news is to appear,
the third problem—that of display—presents itself.
This editorial was in its genesis a defense of the
evaluation of the Senior Hop story as subordinate
to freshman class elections in the November 1 issue.
It could embody the 101 “reasons” which prompted
that decision. However, such “reasons” would at
best be manufactured. Reasons were not sought in
making the original evaluation. It was simply a
question of the knownto-all details of a social event
vs. the previously unpublished account of a demo-
cratic election. Who could doubt the choice?

Were another opportunity given to evaluate these
stories, contrary criticism bordering on outright
attack notwithstanding, the decision would have
been the same. Similarly both Junior Weekend
and Sophomore Soiree may be subordinated to more
vital contemporary affairs, just as Campus Day was
overshadowed by the results of the presidential
straw vote.

The STATE COLLEGE N uws is striving to achieve
Emerson’s observation in Society and Solitude as
“The newspaper~which does its best to make
every square acre of land and sea give an account
of itself at your breakfast table (assembly seat).”

 

 

 

 

STATE COLLEGE NEWS, FRIDAY, NOVEMBER 15, [940

 

We Like Them

The Commentstater—

Editor’s Note:- This is the second in a series of two
“Commentstaters” concerning the fraternity and so-
rority system of State College. The negative view-
point appeared in the November 8 issue of the NEWS.

 

The Senate and the House of Representatives in
this country are vicious groups that perpetuate them-
selves on lobbying and political log-rolling. Under the
guise of performing a. governmental function they
have their unscrupulous fingers in every pie in the
United States. It is time they justified their existence
or removed themselves from the country.

The above paragraph is a parody of the sound phil-
osophy upon which last week’s Commentstater based
its undue and bigoted attack on the fraternitIES and

sororities of State College. This philosophy,

Let’s a malignant vocabulary reeking with preju-
Try dice, an inane sense of logical reasoning,
Logic an unmistakable weakness for over and

misplaced emphasis, and a gross ignor-
ance of the subject are the arguments which last
week’s column advanced against the social set-up at
State. Let us relax a little and look at; the situation
from a logical, factual viewpoint, for logic and facts
will tell a different story.

In any society (State is a society) individuals make
friends. Groups with common ideas and ideals will
assemble. A new individual in the society will look
for the group whose principles and attitudes are sim—
ilar to his own. That is the group he will adhere to
——if the group will accept him as a member. That
is the social arrangement in State College; that is
the social arrangement in any democratic society. In
State College the groups are called fraternities and
sororities. Out in society they are the social institu-
tions—the churches. the community, etc. Fraternities
and sororities are vicious, black-balling. and back-
biting only as society in general has these abnormal
traits.

Our informant of last week would have us believe
that all fraternity men are pretty and dumb; all soror-
ity women are snobblsh cats. These are the social mis-
fits who do all the dirty rushing. This is the de-

spicable minority which dominates school
Let's by holding key positions. These are the
Be chilly people who slide around the halls
Silly on ice cubes throwing a mean cold should-

er at every independent. who dares to
look at them. These are the terrible people who have
bull sessions all the time planning how to detract.
from the social activities of the college. Every time
there is a reception or a basketball game, these or-
ganizations throw a party so as to keep people away.
They don't like basketball—they like lack-ball, and
they don't like dancing unless it is with a freshman.
Sounds kind of silly, doesn’t it? Is it any sillier than
last week's tirade? You judge!

The head said “Neutrals Numerous.” It alliterates
all right. but it has one drawback-4!; isn‘t true. Want
facts? Here they are. Records on file for your in-
spection show that; in the present senior class of 317
members, 38 are transfers and have had no oppor-
tunity to join State fraternities or sororities. That
leaves 279 possibilities. The records show that from
these 279, a total of 170 have affiliations with Greek
societies. This takes no account of the many who
must have dropped pledgeships. Interpretation tells
only one thing—61.2% of a typical State College class
belong to the class of people who control State Col-
lege. Quite natural, isn’t it?

Let us for the sake of argument assume that State
had no fraternities or sororities. Social organizations,
as the name implies, are responsible for much of the

social life of the college; from the facts

Keep presented, may We say 61.2% of the activ-
Social ity. At present the social opportunities
Life at State are not numerous enough to be

considered a danger to scholastic endeav—
or. Imagine, if you will, State College with more
than half of its present social life missing. Take not;
much and divide by two. Sounds a little on the dead
side. doesn‘t it?

There it is in tln'ee-fourths of a column. A logical
analysis justifies organized social groups at State.
Fraternities and sororities are a natural social growth;
to abolish them would defy established social proce-
dure. Such outbursts of personal prejudice are con-
sistently silly and pointless. The minority which
allegedly throttles and detracts from the social life
of States does not exist—the “privileged” people are
in a majority.

likes it.

“This is all strange when you consider it. Dr.

Thespian Trivia

 

Experiment: A recent trend of ad-
vanced dramatics classes has been to l
experiment with the unusual in dra-
matic effects and techniques. Begin-
ning with Bogosta’s “Corridors of
the Soul" several seasons ago, we
have seen experimental attempts ad-
vanced in the staging of “Bury the
Dead,” Thornton Wilder’s drama
without scenery, “The Happy Jour-
ney” and the second act of “Dear
Brutus" which was set; in the en—
chanted forest of Midsummer Eve.
The present schedule as it. is set up
for this semester seems to have a
noticeable lack of this experimenta-
tion. Last year’s class is continuing
as an extra-class group with this
policy in planning a program of
a little entertainment bet-ween pres-
entations.

Advanced dramatics is to be con—
gratulated for attempting to make
the intermission period between
plays less interminable by offering
a little entertainment between pre-
sentations. May we suggest that the
string ensemble of last year be
brought back to play for the audi-
ence?

Posters: The inartistlc, incoherent:
posters of several weeks ago which!
kept people deciphering Chinese"
puzzles instead of informing them.‘

 

Robert Hertel and Anne Rattray

 

about the Tuesday plays, have given
way to the well-planned and execut—
ed art of this week’s display.

You and You: The house light dim.
The curtain parts. The actor who
speaks the first lines “takes up arms
against a sea of troubles”— the trou-
bles being an audience which is still
streaming in. still discussing the
day’s events and rushing develop-
ments or putting away their text-
books. Between plays thc audience
feebly entertains the audience, or it
disregards the talents of intermis-
sion entertainers and reverts to its
former juvenile occupations. Even if
you don't mind admitting your im-
maturity, where‘s your sense of fair—
ness to the actors? You are the
losers. since the plays are put on for
you. Shall We use the tactics of the
Lunts who occasionally step out of
their roles to bow. welcome the late—
comers and explain the play to
them?

Since the student body will have
the opportunity of seeing two plays
on Tuesday evening, let’s make it a
big evening by bringing our best girls
to the plays and fill those empty
seats that night. It’s certainly worth
your while to see those plays. Let's
all go!

Bowling Sequel

This department last week threw
out the proposal that a bowling
league of some sort be organized as
part of Intramural Council’s winter
season. We stressed the fact. that
such leagues have been the policy of
Councils of the past, with the excep-
tion of last year’s; that. in our opin-
ion. there exists enough interest to
make a similar program workable
for the coming winter.

Hardly had the ink dried when
Phil Kaufman accosted us breath-
lessly with a defense of Intramural
Council. According to Phil, he was
entrusted with the task of organiz-
ing a bowling league this year. and
proceeded to tack up the usual appeal
on the MAA bulletin board. When
that list remained weatherbeaten
and blank after a reasonable period
had elapsed. Phil took matters into
his own hands and visited the vari-
ous group houses which might send
teams into a ten-pin loop. The fol-
lowing houses. after a careful check
of their resources, offered to join:

1. Potter Club.

Inasmuch as certain difﬁculties
would be encountered in organizing
a league on this basis. all plans were
abandoned. Such is the tale of bowl—
ing at State this year.

Apparently the interest does not
exist! However. we still maintain
that bowling, a sport rapidly becom-
ing an American institution, and
easily participated in by all, has a
deﬁnite spot. on every college sports
program. We still maintain that
there are plenty of keglers in the
student bodyubut what can we do
about it? Is co-ed bowling the
answer?

Owls? Nol

Incidentally. with the start of the
1940-41 varsity cage campaign but
a few weeks away, doesn't it seem
appropriate that someone somewhere
should come through with an accept—
able name for the team—one with
plenty of-«shall we say “punch”?

A few years ago, the basketecrs
were somehow regaled with the name
“Owls,” a name which everyone ex—
cept; the News promptly forgot.
Eventually even the ans forgot it.
Now it's history, and although we’re
hardly in a position to condemn his—
tory, it seems to us that the time has
come to give the team a permanan
designation.

Since this department does not;
wish to assume dictatorial power in

 

 

determining the inevitable new
lap of the student body. Members of

to circulate among the students seek-
ing suggestions. Unsought sugges—
tions may be placed in the ans

be considered—0n a par with the
rest..

Filler

Intramural basketball has entered
its second week without a hitch. The
current loop goes the local cinema
palaces one better by offering, not
a double feature, but a triple feature
cvcry playing night under pres-
ent plans. Feature attractions are
billed for 'l, 8. and 9 o’clock.

An innovation in the league is the
independent team known as the
Gardephe Gophers, which made its
bow Tuesday night by ekelng out a
close t?) defeat at. the hands of the
Grads. We have been assured that
the distinctive name is a sincere ef-
fort to add color to the sports page,
