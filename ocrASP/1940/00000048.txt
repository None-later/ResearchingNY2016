Poems Must Be

For McIlwaine’s Collection

by Andrew Takes

I lay down and slept after the burial;

I started to school i dreamed,
But had left lny books at home,
Pa brought them it seemed.

I seen him coming stepping high.
Wllicll was' of his walk the way;
i had stopped at a house nearby-—
His face was pale as day.

Wllen he was having convulsions
I-Ie feared ile would hurt me;
Therefore told me to go away,
He had dug artichokes for me.

“To get in my collection, poetry
cannot be just bad—it has to be
superlatively bad.”

With these words, Dr. Shields
McIllwaine, one of the newest mem-
bers of the State College faculty,
described his poetry collection. The
poem above is a specimen from his
“superlativer bad” collection. re-
printed in the Sum COLLEGE Nl-lws
through Dr. McIlwaine’s courtesy.

Dr. McIlwaine terms himself a
“miscellaneous Southerner," and
such he is. He was born, bred, and
educated in the South and has done
most of his teaching there. The son
of a Presbyterian minister, he spent
most of his childhood traveling with
his father from parish to parish in
the various Southern states. Born
in Alabama. he has also lived in
South Carolina and Tennessee.

He received his education at
Southwestern College in Memphis;
attending that institution at the
same time as Dr. C. Currien Smith,
Assistant Professor of Education.

McIlwaine’s ﬁrst teaching posi-
tion was at Lee’s Institute in Breat-
hit County, Kentucky. “They call it
‘Bloody Breathit.”’ he conﬁded

smilingly. “When I got there, the‘

courthouse was already full of
holes. The old family feuds that
once filled the Kentucky mountains,
have now disappeared but human
life is still cheap down there."

“The ﬁrst two weeks I was there
I was afraid to step out of the house
where I boarded because only a few
days before my arrival, a mall had
been killed in its front yard. It
seems he ﬁlled himself with ‘mount-
ain dew' and went on a rampage
waving a shotgun. He pulled the
trigger a few times. and then the
sheriff came after him."

“He caught up with him in the
front yard.”

After a year in Kentucky. Dr.
McIlwaine went to the University of
Chicago on a Fellowship.

Three years followed in which he
taught in the Mississippi State Col-
lege for Women. “I enjoyed myself
those years," says Dr. McIlwaine,,
but I would not care to repeat the
experience." A man who teaches in
a women‘s college feels as if he were
intruding into a female world. Dr.I
Mcflwaine explained and then he
added, “All unmarried instructor in
a women's college is a sage of the
first order."

He then returned to his Alma
Mater. Southwestern College, this
time as a professor. and stayed
there several years, leaving it to
come to State.

“I expected to enjoy State College
before I came to it.” he said upon
being questioned, “and I have not
been disappointed. The students
here seem to be so much more anx-l
ions to learn than the average." l

Dr. McIlwaine wrote a book lastl
year while on a fellowship of the
General Education Board of New
York. Titled. “The Southern Poor-
Whlte," it is a continuous narrative
combining the social and literary
history of the South.

Dr. McIlwaine speaks with a melll-
fluous Southern accent. which he
says has lessened considerably since
he first came to tile North. “When
I first taught in Chicago, my accent'
was so pronounced that my classesl
could hardly understand me," hei
says. Only a few months on the“
State faculty, his courses have be-*
come known as among the most ill-
tcrcsting offered at the college.

Nationwide Examination Reveals
State Students Above Average

State College faculty members
have been known at many times to
llcup laurcls on their classes when
it. comes to the matter of superior
achievement. There lllust be some
scientific reason for such statc~
lncnts. and the key to the answer
may lie in the aptitude and illtclli-T
gellce tests which are given at times
throughout the college career.

most the same in effectiveness of

level of comprehension. Tile wo-
men averaged seven percentile
scores higher than the men on the
total score. It is interesting to note
that 3.687 of the total of 10,534
ranked below the lowest of State wo-

the class ranked 15 percentile points
