Postlude to Perlman

Everywhere in life, the true question in not
what we gain but what we do.
—Carlule.

One Friday, two years ago, a freshman with
a marked gift for oral expansiveness had the
members of the Student Association tittering
in their auditorium seats when he announced
that he was organizing a symphony orchestra.
Week after week, that freshman amused the
assembly with “pleas” for student musicians
and financial support. Our “Doubting
Thomases" knew he was attempting the im-
possible—it was like waiting for an uptown
car on the downtown side of the street.

Today that freshman, Bernard Perlman, is
a junior. Last night he appeared again in the
auditorium, not to make an announcement,
but to conduct the Symphony Orchestra in a
Music Council presentation that would ordi-
narily feature such World famous artists as
the Don Cossacks. In two short years, almost
single-handed, Perlman has shaped a gang of
raw musicians into an organization rivaling
professional orchestras. If to any one person
the responsibility for last night’s achieve-
ment can be assigned, that person is Perlman.

The work that he has put into the orches-
tra would be a full time job for most men.
Presiding at all rehearsals, learning the music
of every orchestral section, drilling with indi—
vidual sections, interpreting the music, striv—
ing for Music Council recognition, seeking
financial assistance—here was enough work
to occupy most of the waking hours of a pro-
fessional conductor.

Students who have made permanent con—
tributions to State College may be counted
off on the fingers of one hand. If cvor such
a list of State’s “immortals” were made up,
the name of Perlman would merit serious
consideration.

Now it's Our Move

The cllcmlmnrd Is the world.
- Ill/xiv”.

This is a frank appeal to the members of
the Student Association for additional finan-
cial support for the over-victorious chess
team. This morning a resolution will be intro-
duced authorizing an appropriation from the
surplus of $55.00 to (lef‘ay the cost of send-
ing our chess team to the United States inter-
collegiate invitation Championship chess
tournament conducted this year in New York
City from December 26-31. The winner of
this tournament is official United States
Intercollegiate Chess Champion.

So far this year, our pawn pushors have
gone undefeated ill llitcrcollcgiutc competi-
tion. They have beaten NYU, liutgcrs,
Union, IiPl, and Princeton. A win over Coi-
gate, carrying with it the championship of
the Upper liudson Valley intercollegiate
Chess League, is expected tonight. That the
squad is good, such triumphs prove. The
team deserves this opportunity to demon-
strate its ability against the nation’s best.

Since its organization in 1938, the chess
squad has been State College’s best “Press
Bureau.” As an advertising medium alone,
it warrants a $55.00 investment.

 and a Happy New Year'

 

lThe Ferryboat Serenade,

 

This a ferry tale about two plays
which missed the boat. Those who
cruised aimlessly about State's stage
Tuesday night are numerous. In
Shaw's egotistical advertisement for
Candida we found a girl who thought
she could do high comedy; she deliv-
ered the part with impossible diction.
Her lover’s attempts to give the play
its proper lightness were thwarted
by her total lack of interpretation.

The husband might have made the
boat if he had given his part more
time in preparation. The furniture
made a valiant attempt to get over
the gangplank by coming in the
front way. but even this only added
to the general confused impression.

Most fairy tales have a happy end-
ing, but this one is different. The

Robert Hericl 8: Anne Rattray

 

heroine of the evening‘s tragedy
achieved her glory by illegitimate
means; she stole the show. The red-
halred busybody “pried” her way to
top honors. The farmer was vaguely
'old with a makeup resembling the
Mississippi at its muddlest. His wife
depended too much on facial expres-
sion rather than interpretation of
lines to convey her semi-deranged
character. Her constant addressing
the audience became ineffectual.

To our mind, a blase clergyman is
an impossibility, particularly when
we find a hangover from Bury the
Dead under a dashing fedora.

 

The moral of our tale is obviously
,this: Advance Dramatlcs, don’t miss
the boat too often!

 

An Appraisal of "The Great Tradition"

“It is easier to be critical than correct.”

Dear T 'adit‘ion Appraiser:

—l)israeii

To label an idea or practice TRADITION is easy.
Therefore, last week’s TRADITION appraiser had an
easy job. lll all fairness, it must be admitted that some
of the items of last Week’s article may be open to criti-
cism. Altogether too many, however, are listed so
arbit 'arily by the author, thus l'chaling that he does

not fully understand the
valued by State students.

vital things most highly

Fewer than 20 per cent of the students indulge in the

We Pay Our Debt:

The Communicator——

For almost a semester this column has
been complaining. Practically every phase of
State College life has at some time or other
been attacked. No one has escaped criticism.
We have attacked fraternities, sororities,
rushing, Myskania, school spirit, courses, and
student attitudes. We have repeatedly
brought to the attention of our readers those
things about the college which we thought
were not as they should be. Very rarely has
a word of praise appeared in this column.
From September it has been one long com-
plaint.

Today we undergo a change in attitude. In
this, the final issue of the year, we take re-
spite and lay down our cudgels. The Yuletide
spirit is in the air, and there is no time better
than the present to demonstrate our grati-
tude for some of the better things that have
come to our college unnoticed and unsung.

Liberal Myskania

We are grateful:

For a liberally minded Myskania, which
has shattered precedent by snake dancing in
assembly. We are glad to see the starch
ﬁnally dissolving from a body which tradi-
tion has up to now made formal and ultra-
digniﬁed.

For smoother and more spirited assemblies.
The chair has been doing an excellent job. It
is gratifying to see that the ﬁrst rap of the
gavel is sufficient to bring the most disorderly
assembly to order.

For the end of rushing. Since the begin-
ning of the semester it has been a source of
irritation and enmity to many students. With
its close, we may see an easing of fraternity
and sorority spirit, and a revival of school
spirit. The student body has too long this
year been separated into small organizational
cliques each ready to do battle with the
others for the freshman class. The upper—
classmen may now rest at peace and resume
their normal lives and their normal friend—
ships.

For the clean-up campaign. The Commons
has ﬁnally been given a bath. Campus Com-
mission has been given a new set of teeth
with which to enforce its dicta. Waste paper
baskets have been conveniently placed in the
lower corridor of Draper Hall.

For the Publications Office—that new phe-
nomenon which recently emerged from the
dirt, confusion, and smoke which was once
the activities office.

Pep “Powwow” Packed Punch

_ For last week’s pep meeting. The inspira-
tlon that led to its placement on the assembly
program, and the guidance that kept it mov-
lng at a hilarious pace did much to make the
11:10 Friday morning hour a lot more than
something to be cut by any and all. An
assembly such as that, once in a while, not
only ls a refreshing bit of fun, but it also
does wonders to school spirit.

For Christmas vacation.

For these things, we are grateful.

'And, above all, We are grateful for the coll-
(llthilI that makes all these things possible——
Amcrlca is at peace.

This column is being written un-
der protest.

Overheard at the RPI slaughter
the other night was the following
comment summarizing the game:
State stinks, RPI stinks, and the
referees stink. The first angle is the
one that concerns us.

In more polite language, the State
outfit that fumbled away forty min-
utes in ’87 Gym Saturday night was
a far cry from one of the fighting
State fives of old. The boys weren’t
taking chances, weren’t shooting
enough to satisfy us.

The Clarkson win caught us una-
wares. In the pinch. the statesmen
held up well. However. for better
than an even break on the season.
the boys will haVe to develop more
aggressive tactics. In other words,

more of the “old fight."

State’s Frosh cagers get their
first opportunity to cavort before
the home fans tonight when they
face a strong Albany Academy five
in the preliminary to the varsity
contest. Impressive in their first
start, despite a loss to RPI's yearl-

bet to record win number one against
an Academy team that boasts a
victory in its only start to date.

Cagers Defeat Clarkson,
Meet Brooklyn Tonight

 

ing Brooklyn Polytechnic Institute with a balanced ledger—

 

ke to Page Hall tonight, meet-
tory over Clarkson Tech, 42-39.

D A vast improvement was shown in
Monday evening's performance.
Speed and cutting coupled with
Brauner’s snaggin‘ ’em off the back-
boards were instrumental in keep-
ing the Teachers in top position. At
RPI the team as a whole showed
lack of acclimation to a huge court
with lively backboards.

Poly Lineup

Little is known about Brooklyn
Poly’s ability. They usually have a
pretty good roster. The probable
starting lineup for the Institute is:
Charles Walsh, captain, Herman
Brunotti, Richard Schwarting, a
formidable veteran. Alfred Mila-
shefsky, and Thomas Heifer-nan.

Tomorrow the team takes a long
jaunt to Canton to meet powerful
St. Lawrence University. The Lar-
ries have won their first two con-
tests, defeating St. Michael's and
mighty Colgate.
Larries Powerful

Northern observers have predict-
ed that this year's Laurentian quin-
tet will be a high-scoring aggrega-
tion. Diminutive Joe Tilhurst from
East Syracuse is expected to star,
pressed by sophomores John Var-
soke from Amsterdam and Len Lar-
son‘ from Rockvllle Center, L. I.
Bill Bartlett of Rutherford, N. J.
and Don Sherwood, Oswego, will
round out the first squad. Other
noteworthy teams carded by the
Laurentians are Syracuse Univer-
sity, Fordham University, Niagara
U., Ithaca, and the University of
Mexico.

In another December tilt the Feds
will meet Siena on the local boards

record thus far with two wins to

CH Beats BAR,
Bolstering Lead

College House widened its lead in
the Intramural Basketball league
Monday by defeating BAR. 22-16.
The league leaders after trailing
11-10 at the half and 16-14 at the
end of the third quarter came back
with their well-known last quarter
spree to win—scoring five points in
the final two minutes.

Carney of CH scored five points
to raise his total pointage for five
games of play to 39 giving him the
individual scoring lead. Anderson
of on was high scorer for the game
with eight points, thus raising his
total to 38 to tie with Gowdy of
the Grads for second place. Sprowls
of BAR added six points to his total
putting himself in third place with
3'7 points. Jordan of SLS meanwhile.
although having played only four
games, is in fourth place with 36
points.

Cooper House made up for its de-
feat at the hands of Dorm B the
previous week by scoring a. 6-0 vic-
tory over Commuters B Wednesday
night during the second session of
intramural basketball play. Al-
though not indicated by the score,
this game was a close one with the
possession of the ball constantly see-
sawing between the two teams.
Newman fell before Jumpers in
the second contest of the evening.
This was the ﬁrst game for both,
with the ﬁnal score 10-4 in Juniper’s
favor. The third game scheduled for
the night was_handed to the Dorm
C team by way of a forfeit by Wren
Hall.

Swimming enthusiasts will have
to restrain themselves from rusth
down to the pool until after the
Christmas vacation. It seems that
parties will be taking up the time
next week.

Belts and cork products have been
occupying the time of the Craft
Club members so far, and this week
wood and metal materials will be
available for the girls. Work may be
started Tuesday night and taken
home to be ﬁnished. How about
those Christmas presents?
