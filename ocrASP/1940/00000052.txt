Continuing the educative program
to aid seniors and graduate students
seeking employment; in the ﬁeld of
teaching, Miss Irene Semanek, As-
sistant Director of the Student Em-
ployment Bureau. 9‘ "maps the
formation of volunta, cttees
to investigate certain phases u .
terest to the prospective LL L

The committees will report on We
following subjects: "Ethics of Job
Hunting,” “Personal Interview and
Appearance," and "Letters of Appli-
cation.”

All seniors and graduate students
who wish to volunteer for commit-
tee work are to come to the Student
Employment Bureau office in Milne
and sign up for the committee they
are interested in. The committees
will hold a meeting sometime next
week.

The Bureau especially requests all
graduate students who have been
in the teaching field to volunteer to
serve on a Round Table in a public
discussion, to be held sometime be-
fore examination. This discussion
will bring to light actual experiences
of those seeking jobs and will afford
many hints to the prospective job-
seekers.

The form of the committee reports
will depend on the discretion of the
members—panel discussions, printed
information, or whatever method
the committee sees fit to use. The
work is definitely a student project,
with all the work being done by the
students.

The idea of student committee re-
ports was originated three years ago
by Mr. Paul G. Bulger, Director of
the Student Employment Bureau.
Since then the committees have
been functioning yearly on a gen-
erally expanding scope.

Old Tradition

 

At Recent Montreal Discussion

by Edwin J. Holstein

To the north of us there is a city
about seven times as large as Al-
bany. This city in “another coun-
try"—a country at war. is Montreal
in Quebec, Canada. To this city on
November 30, journeyed a delegation
of the American Foreign Policy As-
sociation at the invitation of the
Canadian Institute of International
Affairs. As one of the delegates,

Mrs. Martha A. Egelston, instructor

in History at State, returned to tell
of her observations and interpreta-
tions.

Women are not regarded highly in
the public life of Quebec. In their
own words they have been “chattels.”
The American female delegates were
told that they could speak in the
round-table discussions of the con-
vention. However, when Mrs. Egcl-
ston signaled for recognition, she
saw that it would not be forthcom-
ing; the result-shc spoke anyway.
Silence settled over the assembly. A
woman had spoken on international
affairs for the first time in the his-
tory of the organization.

Mrs. Egciston confesses that she
went to Montreal full of hope; hope
that was speedily squelched by the
prevalent pessimism she found there.
Pointing out that the "press" has
held that there is no evidence of
war in Canada, she stated that

“every thing is conditioned by the
war."

Uniforms are everywhere in Mon-
treal; the most striking are those
“slate-blue with plenty of brass” out-
fits of the R. A. F. The soldiers un-
like our own, are much less con-
scious of uniforms.

A spirit has seized the people of
Montreal; a deeply imbedded convic-
tion tempers their lives. Mrs. Egcl-
ston feels. They feel that there will
always be an England. even if they
are defeated. Kill thorn all, but there
will always be an England. Parallel
to this feeling of patriotism. how-
ever, is the same group philosophy
that is found in the United States
today, namely defense of the west-
ern hemisphere at any price,

Both interesting and significant is
the fact that Mrs. Egclston saw a
concentration camp on an island in
the St. Lawrence River. On the back
of each inmate there is a bright
scarlet spot tcn inches in diameter.
Trousers are blue and red striped.
I'ier comment was "Escape from such
a place is impossible."
