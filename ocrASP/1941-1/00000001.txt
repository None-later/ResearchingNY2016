Fraternity Men
Dance Tomorrow

Co-Chairman Mancuso, Pearson
In Charge Oi 'Bidless' Ball;
Don Killion’s Band Plays

Interfraternity Council will con-
duct its Sixth Annual Ball tomorrow
night in the Gymnasium of Page
Hall from 9 P. M. to 1 A. M. Don
Killion’s orchestra of Schenectady
will furnish the music.

George Pearson and Delfio Man-
cuso. seniors, co-chairmen of the
affair, promise that “the ball will
outdistanee the previous fraternity
affairs in attendance, good fellow-
ship, and achievement of the pur-
pose for which the annual formal
is conducted.”

Each fraternity. using a system of
its own. will contribute to the total
expenses of the ball. With this
“bidless” system it is expected that
more men. who previously could not
afford to attend, will be able to come.
All indications at the present show
that there will be a record turnout.

Before vacation a vote was taken
in all fraternities to determine
whether members wanted to have
flowers or not. Three of the fra—
ternities decided against it, but Pot-
ter Club wanted the ﬂowers. Like
the Ancient Polish Diet or the
amendment system of the Articles of
Confederation, a unanimous vote of
the council members is needed to
pass a measure. Thus flowers, will be
in vogue tomorrow night.

Following are the committee
chairmen: arrangements. Howard
Anderson, '42, and Jack Bradt, ’43;
programs, Allan Woodell, '42; music,
Cyril Kilb. ’41.

Chapel-ones will be Dr. Donnal V.
Smith and Mrs. Smith. and Dr.
Howard A. DoBell and Mrs. DoBell.

Guests will include all the faculty
members of the four fraternities.

Fraternity pledges will aid in the
decoration of the gymnasum tomor-
row afternoon.

Juniors to Dance
At [Snow' Party

Leading the classes in informal
social events, the Junior Class will
conduct its annual class party to-
night in the Commons of Hawley
Hall from 8 to 11:30 P. M.

As announced by the general
chairman of the affair, Alberta Lee,
the dance will follow the theme of
a Snow Party. However, Miss Lee
would elucidate no further on the
details of the ‘42 plans.

Paul Merritt, president of the
class of '42, said: “As has been the
policy in the past. it will be a non-
date affair due to the unfavorable
ratio of men to women. I cannot
attend because of a basketball trip
north.——I’li see the snow but not the
party."

Assisting Miss Lee as committee
heads are: entertahunent, Margaret
Hollinger; refreshments, Mary Sosa.
Wing; decorations. Josephine Trum—
bull; and publicity, David iiaye-
slip.

NYA Adds
Thirty to Rolls

Delaney Fears Defense Program
May Cut Reliel Allotments
And Student Aid Funds

Due to an unexpected increase in
its allotment of funds, the NYA of-
fice of State College has added thir-
ty persons to the payroll, according
to Ralph Clark, ’41, student Direc-
tor of NYA.

In the beginning of the year.
working under the handicap of cur-
tailed funds, it was imperative to
cut down the NYA list. Preference
was given to uppcrciassmen, with
very few freshmen receiving aid.

Students have a. tendency to
think of NYA as a definite part of
the college program. and often in-
clude anticipated aid in figuring
their budgets for the coming year.
NYA is by no means a definite part
of the college program, and the ad-
ministrative officials do not know
from year to year whether the aid
will be forthcoming.

With this in mind, Dean Delaney
urges the students not to include
any aid from NYA when making
out their budgets for the next year.
This will be especially true next
year. due to the defense program.

to provide defense funds. and it i 1
highly probable that NYA will bl!

among the departments cut.

Lisa Rembova’s play A Man

a complete make-up. Marion Adams,
Byron Benton, William Phipps, A1-
ice Reese, Shirley Siegel, Muriel Sco-
vell, Mildred Studley, Jean Tracy,
Janet Woods, and Luke Zilles, sopho—
mores, and Harold Ashworth and

ing will be But Not Love, a weird

tis, Morris Gerber, Betty Taylor,
