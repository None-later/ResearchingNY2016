State Graduate
Army Volunteer

Former Member of MysIrania
In Canadian Infantry Unit
Ready Ior Active Duty

He started out to become a teach-
er and now he is in the Canadian
army!

Frank Hardmeyer, one of the lead-
ing members of the class of 1936 was
graduated from State College as a
teacher. Since then he has gone
through a variety of experiences. He
taught dramatics in the Albany High
School, he has wrestled professional-
ly, he has worked as a night watch-
man, he has written, achieving
some recognition as an author. A
few weeks ago, he embarked on a
new adventure.

Following the call of his fancy, he
left the United States, and went to
Canada where he enlisted in the
famed Black Watch, a crack Cana-
dian infantry unit.

Active at State

Hardmeyer. while at State, was
one of the outstanding men in his
class. He was class president in his
senior year, and a member of My-
skania. He was also active in dra-

 

 

 

 

matics and debate.

Hardmeyer's joining the Black
Watch is a curious quirk of fate. In
his junior year. he appeared in a
play on the Page Hall stage, Sir
James Barrie's, “The Lady Shows
Her Medals." In that production, he
took the part of a young man in
the Black Watch regiment. That
was the first time that Hardmeyer
wore the kiits which are a standard
part of the Black Watch uniform.
Today he is wearing those kilts
again —— this time in real life and
not on the stage.

Eager to Fight

Last October, I-Iardmeyer, who
visited State College briefly,
astounded his friends by announcing
that he was on his way to join the
Canadian air force. “I want to get
in the fighting," he said. "We’ll be
in it sooner or later, and I'd rather
not wait."

When he arrived in Canada, he
was rejected as an airman because
of a slight color-blindness. Seeking
some other way of entering the con-
flict, he enlisted in the Black Watch
regiment, whose bravery and fight-
ing ability have made them world
famous. In Albany for Christmas
vacation, Hardmeyer came to State
College in a visit to Dr. John M.
Sayles.

College Chorus
Offers Concert

Hummel, Noted Pianist, Guest
On Annual Winter Program
As Instrumental Soloist

The State College Choral Society
presented its Annual Mid-Winter
Concert to a near capacity crowd in
the auditorium of Albany High
Sschool last evening. The chorus,
under the direction of Dr. T. Fred-
erick H. Candlyn, assistant Pro-
fessor of Music, consisted of sixty-
seven students, who were chosen
from the 120 who tried out for the
concert.

Dr. Candlyn was fortunate in
securing the services of Stanley
Hummel, a noted pianist, as guest
artist. Mr. Hummel recently ap-
peared in a series of concerts with
his brother, Earl Hummel, a noted
violinist.

Mr. Hummel played eight selec-
tions from such famous musicians
as Bach, Mendelssohn, and Chopin.
Perhaps one of the most entertain-
ing numbers was Rondo Capric-
cioso, by Mendelssohn, a delight—
fui and imaginative selection.

The Choral Society presented ten
outstanding compositions, including
Love Come Down At Christmas,
the music for which was written by
Dr. Candlyn.

Mrs. Jane Weir Damino, ’41, sang
as a solo The Golden Sun Was
Sinking, arranged by Baldwin,
while Mrs. Damino and Miss Audrey
Benfield, ’43, joined in the duct,
Angels O’cr the Fields, by Dickin-
son.

Laborers Redecorate
Women Dean's Office

The office of Miss Sara T. De-

mitted to a major redecoration
during the Christmas recess. The
door to her inner office, formerly
nearer to the windows facing West-
ern Avenue. was moved nearer the
wall which separates the outer of—
ﬁce from the corridor. The new
irrangement was made for greater
convenience to students and the
dean.

Visitors to the Dean of Women
will also find that she now has a
large mahogany desk with a glass
top and a new chair.
