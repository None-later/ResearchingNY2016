‘Bardia’ Bet Brings
Victory to British

 

With the attention of the entire
world focused on the British
seige of the Libyan port of
Bardia last week, for was it from
state College to stand aloof.

On Friday, December 27. Paul
(Senator) Grattan. ’41, and Bill
Dorrance. ’42, made a little wager.
Bill bet the Senator that Bardia
would be captured by General
Wavell’s Army of the Nile by
noon (New York Time) on Jan-
uary 6.

Well, the British High Com-
mand obliged Bill by announcing
its victory on January 5.
