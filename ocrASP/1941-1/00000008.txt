i Seniors, Grads Asked to Leave
Second Semester Schedules
At SEB Office in Milne

The student committee investigat-
ing “Personal Interviews and Ap-
pearances" of job-seekers will pre-
sent its report Thursday afternoon
at 4:30 P. M. in Room 20. This
meeting will be for the benefit of
seniors and grads, who are urged to
attend by Miss Irene Semanek, As-
sistant Director of the Student Em-
ployment Bureau.

The committee is working under
the co-chairmanship of Miss Ruth
Larson and Joseph Schwartz, sen-
iors.

Mimeograph Report

The committee working on the
topic “Letters of Application” will
have their report mlmeographed in-
to a booklet which will be kept at
the Student Employment Bureau
offices in Milne, where the seniors
and grads may obtain copies.

The booklets will enable job-seek-
ers to have the technical knowledge
of form and content of the letters
always at their disposal. Jack
Gardephe, ’41, is chairman of the
committee.

Students planning to send letters
to schools will be able to find the

 

 

 

 

names and addresses of principals in
“Handbook 24." Copies of this hand-
book may be found in the SEB of-
fices in Milne, and in the State Col-
lege Library. Students are urged by
Miss Semanek to use these hand-
books to check on addresses and
spelling.
To Fill Schedule Cards

Those seniors and grad students
who have not already done so are
asked to come to the office and fill
out their schedule cards for the
second semester. Students are to
check the hours filled by classes and
indicate the room number. It is im-
portant that 'the students indicate
where they may be located when not
in classes. This is to enable the Bu-
reau to get in touch with a person
any time of the day, including week-
ends.

Class OT ’43 Plans Party;

Appoints Tracy Chairman

The liiillllllllllll'ti class will featuri

its annual clans party 'li‘riday, Ii‘ob~
ruury Bil, in the Commons of How-
ley Hall from lisliO 'tili 12 P. M.

Bryant 'i‘aylor, president of tin

class of '43, announced that Jean
Tracy Would be chairman of the
coming event. Don Killion's orches—
tra has been engaged, and (mtortainw

ment in being planned.

Because of the fact that sopho—
more women outnumbered the men
in the class two to one, they will
be permitted to bring escorts from

Geniai, friendly, competent —-
these adjectives aptly describe Dr.
Oscar E. Lanford, Jr., new head of
the Chemistry Department at State
College.

Dr. Lanford's soft, southern ac-
cent verifies the fact that he spent
his early life south of the Mason-
Dixon line. He attended the Vh'-
ginia Miliary institute where he
majored in chemistry and might
easily have been a friend of
“Brother Rat” or a “Rat” him-
self. As an army man, Lanford is
thoroughly in favor of conscription
at the present time for national
defense. v
After graduating he was employed
in Indianapolis as a “Shoe Polish"
chemist for two years with the
“2 in 1 Shoe Polish Company.” Lan-
ford then enrolled in the Graduate
School of Columbia, where he had
obtained a three-year teaching fel-
lowship. After two years he was ap-
pointed an instructor in chemistry,
and then came to Albany.

Dr. Lanford’s ascension in the
Chemistry Department has carriedi
with it several innovations and many
improvements. The labs have been
renovated. and the stock rooms re-
juvenated with new cabinets. In
several courses, Lanford, instead of
having his neophyte chemists write
up their experiments, quizzes them
on the material studied.

Dr. Lanford’s work in chemistryl
may be regarded as pure research.
He has discovered three new com-
pounds of vanadium. which may
have a potential practical value in
the steel industry.’ Modestly. Dr.

Lanford attributes his discoveries in
the field of science to nothing more
or less than Lady Luck.

He is particularly interested in
Oscar E. Lanford, the third, who is
better known as “Ochie”. Other
interests include gardening, riding,
and in taking photographs-espe-
cially of “Ochie.”

Mrs. Lanford is also an eminent
scientist. She is the daughter of Dr.
Henry C. Sherman of Columbia Uni-
versity. probably the world’s leading
food chemist. Mrs. Lanford and Dr.
Sherman have cooperated in many
experiments, and are co-authors of
the recently published book. “The
Essentials of Nutrition.“ This book
is now being used to supplement the
text book in Mr. Sturni's course in
Chemistry of Nutrition. It is also
being widely used as a text book
in Food Chemistry courses,

Dr. Lanford (Oscar) and Dr. Lan-
ford iCaroiinel met at Columbia
W1“l‘u she was assisting her father
in a long series of experiments in-
volving vitamins, calcium. and re—
lated subjects. Mr. Lanford was’
then working towards the comple—:
tion of his MA. and PhD. degrees.‘

At the present time Mrs. Lanford
is devoting most. of her spare time
to writing up experiments which shcy
completed in New York before coin—1
ing to Albany. "The only chance I
research is withl
“Ochie.” she sighed. “I hope we
won't get the same results from our
nutritional theories as we did withl
our little spaniel. We followed our;
theories faithfully. and he grew;

about twice as large as normal." i

Perlman’a Orchestra
To Play at Academy

 

It's a half-holiday for some
State Students when the State
College Symphony Orchestra pre-
sents a concert of special music
at the Albany Academy Thursday
morning, March 6.

Dr. John M. Sayles, acting pres-
ident of the college. is thoroughly
in favor of this, as he feels it will
enhance the prestige of State
College and promote good will.

Bernard Perlman. '42, who
wields the baton. claims that if
the orchestra secures many more
engagements like this it will soon
be self-supporting.
