Queries oi Students Answeied 
At Meeting of State Men 1

By Hale, Bulger, Semanek

Urging draftees to keep in touch

with the college. and declaring that ;

State would look out for their
best interests while away, John M.i
Sayles. acting president of the col-t
lege, spoke Friday at a meeting in‘;

Room 20 of all students eligible forl _

the draft. Approximately seventy
men attended.

The benefits and requirements of
Flying Cadet training were outlined
by Dr. Clarence F. Hale, Professor of 3
Physics. who stated that the Phys-
ics department would cooperate inl
every possible way to help studentsl
meet the requirements, giving eve-i
ning‘ classes it necessary.
SEB To Ignore Draft

Paul G. Bulger. Director of the'
Student Employment Bureau, stated
that selective service numbers,
would be ignored and all eligiblesi
who were not definitely drafteti‘
would be recommended by the‘
bureau. ,

When questioned as to the advisi-
bility of enlisting while still an un-
dergraduate to complete the year of
service, Dr. Sayles expressed doubt.
due to the fact that one now enlists,
for the “duration of the emergency.“
and not merely a year. He went out

Attention Men—Typical State Co-ed Proves Existent;
She Prefers Individualism, Dating, Early Marriage '

 

by Virginia Polhemus
Gather around. fellows and read
about what State considers its typi-
cal co-ed is like and what she likes.
In the first place. only 128 of the
fairer sex admitted they were a
typical State College girl. but 155
of them emphatically denied the
description. Her existence was even

-doubted by many of the girls an-

swering the questionnaire in as-
sembly. As one girl stated it, “What
is one?" We’ll leave it to you to de-
cide whether or not the typical State
College co-ed exists.

According to statistics (for which
we gratefully acknowledge our in-
debtedness to Messrs. Bob Patton
and Will Weyant), the typical State
College co-ed stands 54%", tipsthe
scales at 124 lbs, and wears size 14
clothes. Her medium coloring is set
off by deep brown eyes and brown
curly locks. Sounds quite alright,
don’t you think?

With all this talk going around

.about being individualistic, we won-

dered about invidualism at State. It
seems that 155 of the femines would
prefer to be included in this category
while 113 of them wouldn't. A hap-
py medium is sought by 35 of our
colleagues.

One girl declared that she did

,want to be distinctive, that is. “at

g
least enough to be interesting!" An-

 

other said, “I think State College
girls are quite individualistic." Lack
of money prohibits one lassy from
showing her individalism. Too bad!

Just what does the typical co-ed
do when she is not concentrating on
teaching (which quite a few denied,
anyway)? In the sports line. despite
the cold wintry winds outside, swim-
ming was far ahead in the favor of
the co-eds. Another summer sport,
tennis, sought recognition. Skating
—-either roller or ice—also occupies
their time. It might be advantag-
eous if it could be ascertained who
the two young ladies are who prefer
dating as their favorite occupation
and the third one who frankly de-
clared necking was her ﬁrst choice.

Opinions about the newest style
trends on our campus were obviously
influenced by the recent Hell Week
initiations, causing votes to be cast
for such things as pigtails, striped
shirts, boxing gloves and onion
necklaces. Heaven forbid a wide-
spread adoption of the latter! In a
more serious vein, the newest trends
advocated were boots, knee socks,
p-j tops for blouses, suspenders,

for her wardrobe because, as she

'stated it, “My father pays my bills

and informs me about their exces-
siveness." Quite an ideal state.

Now that We have the typical
state co-ed. what is her goal in her
chosen profession? An amazing per-
son stated. "Sapienta non sua sed
causa locendi.” For those who don‘t
know—that is the State College
motto. More power to her! As was
to be expected, numerOUS co-eda
openly declared “A Man!” One even
said, "Not Ma, but Mrs."

Undoubtedly, early marriage is
foremost among the intentions of
State femmes, as many of the oo-
eds agreed with the sentiment of
one—“A good job for a couple of
years; then—praise the Lord—mar-
riagei"

There she ls—what do you think,
fellows?

 

 

earrings, Jerkins, Dickles and junk
Jewelry. One young sheltered soull
could not reveal the prices she paid

the sway of the live year plan, and,
would have to finish two years of
training before becoming eligible forl
jobs.

In reply to a query concerning the
drafting of contract holders. Dr.
Sayles presumed that the holder
would be given a leave of absence.
and his job held for him. Five of the
faculty are eligible for the draft, and,
Sayles asserted that their jobs would i,
be held for them ill case they were‘
called.

Training Year‘s Intermission

Bulger explained further that the'
Student Employment Bureau would
defer l‘t}(3()illllll'litllllloll of drain-es
for the year they were in trainingu
but would recommend the men for

was over. it will merely be :1 year's

Bulger added that students hired
to fill draft vacancies will have the
benefit of one year's experience and
will be recoiiiiin-iiili-d by the bureiui‘

"It is safe to say that this class is
