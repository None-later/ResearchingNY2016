The Perfect Tribute

It is an unwritten tradition that a college
names its buildings after those individuals
it deems great. Such buildings are a shrine
to those men and women so that those who
come after will never forget their work and
service to the college. State College has a
small group of such “unforgettables” whose
memories have been hallowed and enshrined
in the buildings of the college. Huested Hall,
Hawley Hall, Draper Hail—all are named
after, and all honor, great names once identi-
ﬁed with State.

This June will see the completion of
another permanent addition to the college.
A men’s dormitory will join the women’s
dormitory, already standing. These build-
ings now bear no more pretentious names
than Alumni Residence Halls numbers 1 and
2. Are we destined to refer forever to these
buildings by number when probably the two
most important contributors to the modern
life of State College remain unhonored? Cer-
tainly we do the memories of former Dean
Anna E. Pierce and the late Dr. Abram
R. Brubacher, president of the college for
twenty-ﬁve years, an injustice when we con-
tinue to identify the residence halls by
numbers I and 2-

There is no question that Dean Pierce and
the late Dr. Brubacher deserve a place among
the college’s great and recognition in the
title of residence halls. Together Dean
Pierce and Dr. Brubacher guided and brought
State College to maturity. Miss Pierce, still
an active alumna, founded and fostered the
group residence system during her years
at State. Dr. Brubacher fought for and
ﬁnally succeeded in making a fine college
out of what was once a mediocre normal
school.

This may be the last opportunity this gen-
eration which still remember-s Dr. Brubacher
will have to honor him. Certainly the present
world crisis presages that no other college
building which might bear his name will be
erected for years. At any rate, it is out of
the question at this time to re-name any of
the buildings already standing on the campus.

A drive is now under way to furnish a
room in the men’s dormitory, such room to
be a memorial to Dr. Brubachcr. Naming a
room after Dr. Brubachcr, is little more than
a token. Certainly he merits better than
this. If we are going to name a room after
Dr. lirubachor, why not go all the way and
name the whole building after him?

Small group houses on the campus already
bear the names of Miss Pierce and Dr.
Brubachcr. Certainly changing the names of
these houses should not prove a stumbling
block.

It would indeed be a fitting commemora-
tion to the years that Dean Pierce and the
late Dr. Brubachcr served together as ad-
ministrators of the college that their mem-
ory be enshrined in structures that stand
side by side, Pierce Ila/l and Brubachcr Hall.

The first of Tuesday's plays lends
release to our long “suppressed de-
sire" to congratulate Kay Wilson
for introducing a promising new ac-
tress to our stage. Miss Barden was
the only one of the cast who contri-
buted to the intended lightness of
the play. With her “henlike” flutter-
ing she succeeded in contrasting her
part with that of Miss Servatius.
Her role was a bit spotty, in that
she fell out of it occasionally. Miss
Burden nevertheless shows great
promise. Her projection was the
saving feature of the play.

Mr. Evans forgot the age-old ax—
iom that an actor never “plays”
with the audience except in burles-
que. We believe. however, that he
can do as well with comedy as he
has with more serious roles.

Miss Scrvatius has played so many
heavy. dramatic parts well, that a
light. battering touch was probably
a bit unusual for her. She used too
much of her intense. deliberate man-
ner for a satire which required
lightness to put it over.

Technically the play left much to

be desired. Someone had a surrenlis~ ‘

tic nightmare through which an an-
tique desk walked amidst red collo-
phane curtains and vaguely modern
furniture. In short, this was repeti-
tion of the experimental set which,
unfortunately, was not carried
through in its entirety.

Shakespeare is very difficult for
amateurs to produco upon the stage,
We think Miss 'I‘i'unibull's attempt
was an admirable one.

Highlights of the performance
wore lighting. make—up, and contin~
iiity. The lighting was the most out—
standing ln the year's productions.
Congratulations must go to the
director, to Mr. Hardy and the mom-
bars of Stugecraft. who showed what
can be accomplished through the
medium of light.

The witches were excellently hor-

rible. Their use as continuity made
a play out of the disconnected
scenes. Too much attention was
spent on their voices and too little
on their movements. One can make
a "witch" out of lighting, voice, and
make-up. but one should not forget
the gestures of the hands. ,

Mr. Gerber has an excellent speak-
ing voice. but it needs further train-
ing in articulation and variety. At
times his words were blurred and
unrecognizable. Modulation of tone
would have prevented the monotony
of his voice. As to the interpretation
of Macbeth, little growth of charac-
ter was shown. Character should be
developed through actions as well as
through interpretation of lines. We
think Mr. Gerber has a capacity for
action. but he didn't employ it.

Miss Grofi’ interpreted her part
well. but her lack of natural hard-
ness was not compensated by suffi-
cient brittleness in portrayal.

To Mr. Selfert goes our one laurel
for achieving a naturalncss of char-
acter. which the others did not por-
tray. His lines, though few, were felt
as well as said.

The Shining Light
The CommanMataP———-

We are the children of tomorrow, the sires of
yesterday. We look upon that which has gone
before, and we deem ourselves wise in the light
of our knowledge. We burrow into the past, study-
ing, memorizing, listing, comparing; and we mold
upon our sensitive minds a panoramic mural that
only we, its creators, can picture and interpret.
From this handiwork we derive our laws of living
and set, if we can, a Shining light in the dim recesses
of the future to guide them. We are the judges;
we are the authorities; we are the sires of all of
our yesterdays.

From this past We draw our conclusions and put
them to work. We proclaim the mutability of time
and the constancy of humanity, the repetition of
history and the undulation of the ages.
Things are in patterns, we muse, and
we pursue them, reacting in patterns,
thinking in patterns, dreaming in patterns, as
though all time were an enormous cobweb and life’s
whole problem were to find a strand of it on which
to cling.

But we are more than patriarchs of what has
been; we are the children of tomorrow. We behave
as children, play as children, cry as children, and
at length pass from this existence with all the
naivetc of an infant tumbling from a stool. We
may absorb the past, but we never learn from it.
We move into the receding unknown. victims of a
continual thirst for satisfying desires we cannot
understand. We know no end to our dilemma,
except that we, the masters of the past, lie shackled
before the omnipotence of that which is to come.
We anticipate miracles; we achieve triiles. Our
lusts, when satiatcd, are lost like mists before a
driving gale. In either achievement or defeat,
neither of which we fully contemplate, life becomes
an unwilling tragedy, for man is the pawn of
mystery, the child of tomorrow.

We look about us and wonder. We cry into the
darkness, “Why are things thus?” and the hollow
answer returns, “Why?” Yet, even in the face of
this foreboding existence, we must act.
Out of the debris of our lives we must
build for ourselves a philosophy, even
' though it be a transient one. We must
ever maintain one shining light in that great gloom,
which rapidly subjects all things to its likeness.
Strangely enough, we never seem to fathom our
instability, our inevitable drift toward something.

Out of the scraps of the present we must con-
tinualiy piece together a scaffold for tomorrow. It
will be disastrous to build without planning; it will
be futile to plan without building. Things are as
they are but once, and in the hour at hand we must
bend our force and thought toward the shining
light that is ours to kindle. Like the leader of
an over-whelming band, Time swings his scythe,
and humanity dances for a moment before Him.
Then, long before the mass of mankind has caught
the step, the music dies.

—Budget Cut

(Continued from Page 1, column 5)
today were to pay his tax, a $1,035
deﬁcit would still result.

In addition to the foregoing, an
incomplete payment of the tax has
caused a deﬁcit of some 31,580.
Cooper emphasized the fact that
it was not the wish of the Student
Board of Finance to cut the budget,
but that the error made last year,
and the incomplete payments of
this year have necessitated such an
action.

A study of state College Student
Association finances for the past
16 years revealed the fact that a
cut in the budget has become to be
an accepted part of organizational
finances. Of the last 16 years, only
three have passed without cuts in
the budget.

Several suggestions have recently
been advanced to eliminate budget
cuts in the future.

The first is that since budgets
rarely go through the year without
undergoing some cut, that expenses
be planned on a basis of 85% col-
lection of student tux payments.
This would virtually insure a pro-
gram that would be uninterrupted
by a cut in the budget, even if that
program were a curtailed one.
Also suggested has been an in-
crease in the tax levy, or the cutting
of organizational appropriations to
a minimum.
