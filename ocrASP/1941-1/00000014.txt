Three to Get Ready

Today the world is in a seething state of flux.
Oceans boil with the heat of clashing nations—the
same oceans that wash the limits of our own conti-
nent. The molten mass that is EurOpe is being heat-
ed more and more, and radiant heat fans our brow
as we watch the changing shape, intently trying to
predict how it will look when it cools off. Then,
too, we worry as we watch, for we wonder if we will
be drawn into the melting pot to undergo a change.
We hope we won‘t because we love and cherish
things the way they are here at home.

We have seen our friends slip and fall into the lake
of fire, and we have felt very sorry for them. We
have been afraid of being burned, but we have
known that we should help them. We have extend-
ed our hands to them with moral and material help.
We wonder if we will succeed without being burned.
We are not at all sure we will.

We can feel a little heat at our backs as we watch
Europe, and we know that things are also fusing in
the Far East and that we’re going to be concerned
about it soon. We are not quite sure just what we
will be concerned about or just how soon, though.

We are certain of only one thing. We know that
a crisis is coming. We know that at present we
should do everything in our power to be ready for
whatever demands may be made on us.

We, as students, buried in a small scholastic
world, should know all these things, and should be
primed for action——but are we?

We Need It—Do You Want It?

We here at State know we are in a teacher training
institute. We know who the outstanding students
are. We know who contributes the most to student
life. We know who receives the honors.

But who else knows these things?

We do not need to be known for the purpose of
securing more students~~the long waiting lists at-
test to that. What we need to be known for, is to
help us obtain jobs.

Publicity has mar/c many of the best known col-
icgcs. An outstanding example is Sicna, which owcs

The Corn

 

The beauty of a tragedy lies in
the nobility of the victim. It be-
comes morbid only when it is catas-
trophic, engulfing not only the
settled ways of a life of a man, but
the man himself.

Were it not for this reassuring
thought one would hesitate to put
the issue of the present day as
bluntly as one should. Your world
is shaken deeper than you think.
No matter what the outcome or who
the victor, the society in which you
will work will be different, vastly
different.

Pattern Ever Moving

There is an element of tragedy
when a young and new generation,
struggling to fit itself into the in-
herited pattern, finds the pattern
ever moving. Assuredly, some of our
fathers and grandfathers had to
struggle long and hard with them-
selves just to get used to the grown-
up world. It is doubly trying when
there is no certain grown-up world
to get used to. to fit yourself into.
The tragedy then. is that the world
in which we must take our places is
being shaken by world events in
such a way that none of us can fore-
see the exact shape of the things
to come. All we know is that no so-
ciety can withstand the waste of
two major wars, wars that cost sev-
en million dollars an hour, without
modifying or upsetting the econo-
mic. political, and social equilibrium.

The values We know may or may
not persist. The things We cherish
may or may not be abandoned. Now
the tragedy is immense when young
people blindly and somewhat blithe-
ly. and. in part, doggedly, refuse to

see the personal effect of the events
that crowd upon them.

’l‘akcs Values From Past

It has always been the privilege of
youth to gather from the heritage of
the past its code of life and a set
of values that humans have culled
from their experience. How sense-
less to commit to rote the precepts
drawn from experiences that may
never be repeated.

We have a double job. It is neces-
sary not only that we learn to ap-
preciate what human history has
handed us, but that we understand
in what new setting we must apply
the rules of living together. On this
matter the headlines are more
significant than the. footnotes.

1930 World Gone

The beauty in the current tragedy
of mankind, then, lies in the reac-
tion of its victims, youth. It will be
morbid if they hide their heads in
the past and prepare for a place in
the world of 1.931). That world will
never come again. It will be morbid
if they whine of the unfairness of
the burden. It will be beautiful if
they can wake to the significance
of what is occurring and to the
job of reconstructing a stable
order on these chaotic foundations.

The values have been assailed and
the framework in which the values
have been built is all but demolish-
ed. If we can keep our poise, glean
what is good from the past. and fit
it into a structure of society that; we
ourselves help form, then the price
of tragedy will not have been too
great. To do that, we must live in
the present and future as well as the
past.

Lack of sufficient funds lies behind the inade-
quacy of the State College Press liurcau. It is up to
the student body to decide for itself whether or not

What of the Fifth XE?

One of the most vital committees,

cvcr appointed at State College
quintly began an investigation re-
cently of the fivc-ycar—plnn of
teacher training. its recommenda-
tions may point the need to a new
constitution for the Student Asso-
ciation.

Probably few people, havo thought
past the obvious innovations of the
new state law; revision of the (nun—
pua teaching system, for instance,
or effect on academic degrees. There
are further implications, however,
which must be arranged by tho
rdudcnts thematilvcs. Matters of
direct Jurisdiction. they embody our
treasured autonomy of legislative
action. Think for a moment of our
elaborate organization setup. Lead-
ers of nearly every extra—class ac—
tivity are seniors.

 

 

 

| Now a now factor appears, a fifth
your class. perhaps containing Mys—
kuniu alumni. Oldcr, more mature
in experience, should they be re-
tnincd as cx-oi‘i'icio advisers? ,
Should they be eligible for any of-
fice-wand subsequently overshadow
oven seniors in leadership?

Consider Myskania. Frequent
charges accuse the society of annual
self-perpetuation of a “green”
cliquo. Undoubtedly a nucleus of
voicl'ulls would be invaluable here.

An ovor—all look at the situation
prompts the general question, “Will
the fifth—year class belong to Stu-
dent Association?" Tln-ro have been
hints of cadet (off—campus) tench—
lug. Until We know how much time
the graduates will spend on the
campus, it would be wasteful to fix
a place for them.

liantly budding boys.

Cassidy have delivered the goods is therefore a note-

Winterset, Maxwell Anderson’s poetic tragedy, de-
serves much praise. With the opening lines, the au-
dience was lifted into the mood of futility and despair
and held there until the highly dramatic end. One
felt the grip of emotions and was drawn into the
struggle of Mio and Miriamne against an inevitable

Mio was interpreted well. Since his role contained
the theme of the play, the success of the performance
depended largely upon his portrayal. His voice var-
ied through every possibility of interpretation. He
drew the most from every line and gave life and

Miriamne grew better with every line she spoke.
She was a perfect dramatic partner for Mic. Her voice
quality enables her to put a great deal of feeling in
a tragic role. Her death, and that of M10, were deli-
cately and impressively enacted.

The director of Winterset did not enlighten those
unfamiliar with the play by his introduction because
he was neither heard nor understood.

If the action was meant to reveal tension in the
beginning of the play. it was unsuccessful and mean-
ingless. Mio, though well done, would have benefited
by less nasality of tone, and less ballet in movement.
Miramne as a woman desperately in love to the point
of choosing death rather than life alone, should have
thrown restraint to the wind.

Esdras was not an old man, by any means, in the
beginning. His perception of his age was indefinite.

If Pirandello had only telescoped his plot to about
half its length, it would not have bored the audience.

We surmise the purpose of the servants was to
laugh at the crudeness of the peasant. Their failure
to do so confused the audience, and caused us to look
to Aunt Martha for an explanation. She also did little
to clarify the situation. She failed to contrast the
sophisticated glitter of society life with her natural
desire for pleasant simpleness.

The sound effects would have been good if properly
timed. We apologize to the director for the bottle-
cllnking of the audience. Someone should apoligize to
the audience for the nondescript set.

The elder Grattan beamed a proud, brotherly smile
recently, and while intermission was yet a long way
off We were beaming with him, for Grattan the young-
er sold his band to us completely. Here is a bunch of
kids who take themselves seriously and produce
promising jive. The trumpet section starred for solid
sending; the drummer, tireless Ed Langwig, stood out;
the pianist, Don Foucault, is a composer and ar-
ranger of no mean proportions as Well as a good play—
er. The vocalists did well in spots, discounting their
lack of stage personality. All you foolish people who
didn't hear them had better get behind the idea tak-
ing shape. to wit. a return engagement after Soiree has
become a memory. A very desirable arrangement for
people with twinkling toes would be a concert in the

School Principals
To Offer Views

In Auditorium

Bulger Says Seniors and Grads
Will Profit by Discussion
OI Hiring Men in Field

High School Principals will dis-
cuss “What the High School Prin-
cipal Looks For in Beginning Teach-
ers” in a panel discussion tomorrow
morning from 10 A. M. to 12 noon
in the Page Hall auditorium, as
part of the Student Employment
Bureau program to aid eiigibles in
getting jobs.

The discussion is for the benefit
of the seniors and graduate stu-
dents. All faculty members and any
interested undergraduates are wel-
come to come, according to Paul
Buiger, Director of the Student Em-
ployment Bureau. As part of the
program, the participating princi-
pals will answer any questions ask-
ed by the audience.

To Present Definite Ideas

To seniors and graduate students.
Bulger states, “You'll find these
high school principals have definite
ideas about what they're looking1
for, and are frank and honest in
their statements. We can't afford
to miss an opportunity for this
practical contact with men who hire
State College graduates."

This year the Bureau had student
committees investigate pertinent

 

problems as part of its program. SCA

The “Letters of Application" com-
mittee. headed by John Gardcphe,
’41, was the last committee to re-
port. This report, a mimeographcd
pamphlet. was made available to
the students Tuesday. Gardephc
urges all students who have not yet
obtained copies to go to the Milne
office and do so.

Harrison M. Tcrwilligcr. Assistant
Professor of Commerce, aided the
committee, and expressed his wil-
lingness to help any students who
felt the need of further aid.
Bureau Receives Schedule

In connection with students com-
ing to the office for these reports.
Miss Harriet Gadc, secretary of tho-
Buroan. requests all students who
have not completely filled out their
second semester schedule to do so.

“The purpose of the schedule
cards is so that the Bureau will be
able to reach any senior or grud-
uate at a moment‘s notice. if we
are unable to locate a sludan when
we want him. he may miss the
chance of seeing a prospective em-
ployer."

Principals who will serve on the
panel include: Arnold B. Copplng.
Berlin; F. Remington Furlong. Cocy-
mans; Ralph J. Stanley, Lake Lu-
zcrnc; F. Edward Thomson, Borne;
Richard R. Wurht, Albany; Robert
