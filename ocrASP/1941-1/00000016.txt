in cooperation with the college hy-
giene department. will safeguard the
health of those living in all the
Alumni Residence Halls.

All the sub-contractors working on
the building. the plumbers, the elec-
tricians, the steam-fitters, are work-
ing closely behind the contractors
in order to complete the building on
schedule. The plumbing is complet-
ed to the first floor, and the elec-
trical conduits have been installed
up to the mezzanine floor.

The entire building will be air-com
ditioned and completely insulated.
The furnishings will be of oak and
will fit in with the masculine old-
English style. All rooms will be
double, and each man will be pro-
vided with individual equipment in-
cluding a separate closet. Every
sleeping floor will contain two blocks
of lavatories andshowers. Pressing
and laundry facilities will also be
provided.

Mrs. Bertha E. Brimmer, Secretary
of the Alumni Association. defines
the purpose of the Alumni Housing
program. “We believe that group liv-
ing is a definite asset in the prepara-
tion for life. Future teachers, espe-
cially. need practice in living with
others since it is necessary for them
to learn to get along with others
when they obtain jobs away from
home."

Our thanks to Frank Cassidy for
writing his criticism of the Night
with Shakespeare. Take over, Frank.

The classics of English drama have
been ignored too long on the State
College stage. It was a fine idea that
last year’s Advanced Dramatics class
had of presenting scenes from
Shakespeare. But unfortunately, the
presentation of their idea left some-
thing to be desired.

Prologue and continuity were slow
and at times irrelevant. A more dra-
matic manner of telling a story—an
actor’s method—would have prepar-
ed the way for the scenes in a better
fashion and given Mr. Case a better
character.

In a singularly pointless play. Miss
Cummings established an interesting
character. Mr. I~Iertel was a disap-
pointment. His Shakespeare lacked
the fire and color to attract a high
school girl. Miss Van Valkenburgh
was a beautiful “Dark Lady."

Mr. Withcy is a serious—minded
and hard-working young man. Fri-
day evening's show is proof of It.
But I must say I did not like his
“Hamlet.” His staccato delivery
stripped poetry and passion from the
role. leaving him but a few minutes
of real feeling. Miss Servatius was
vague in the difficult role of the
queen.

Mr. Meltz's "Macbeth" had long
passages of moving beauty and fine
restraint. It was a grand perform-
ance. Miss Miller's Lady Macbeth
lacked depth and suffered from blur-
red diction.

The scenes from “The Taming of
the Shrew” were wisely saved for
the end. The dash and freedom of
Mr. Withey’s direction made them
some of the finest comedy of the
season. Miss Rattray's Katharina
was a fine, high-spirited mare. Mr.
Kunz' Petruchio was his best work
to date. Mr. Gardephe and Mr. Dil-
lenbeck were a pair of fine Shakes-
pearean fools.

Congratulations go to Miss Golden

Canning the Campus

for her interesting and flexible sets,
to the costume and makeup commit-
tees for their careful and effective
work. to Mr. Perlman and Mr. Nor-
dell for their music. to the Men of
State for their music and clowning.
and especially to Mr. Withey, who
organized the whole enjoyable eve-
ning.

Yes, little girl. Shakespeare was
, not such a bad guy after all.

We're back again to tell you that

the last plays of the season brought
It to a memorable close. The au-
dience which braved the misplaced
“Spring” weather found entertain-
ment worth the effort. The best lin-
pressions of the Night at the Inn
were: the very “able” seamen with a
refreshing Fink. a convincing Kiley
and an emotionally-improved Soder- .
lind. The mood succeeded Ill really
gripping the audience through the
inspired acting, the purposeful
movement and the fiawlessness
,ol‘ the technical side of production.
‘Mr. Cassidy's mild suavity gave the
desired effect of omniscience but
could have been hardened a bit. An
excellent production. Mr. Vassililw.
‘ Another side of Dunsany was re-
I vouled in an amusing curtain speech
by Miss Servatlus and in her play.
The brilliant spots of the perform-
once were unfortunately hampered
by the faulty English accent which,,
like the provorbiai lightning. never‘
struck in the same place twice. Mr.
Barseieu. with only it small bit. was
the only authentic Englishman in
the play, and an engaging character
as well. Mr. Kiley displayed his Ver-
satiiity when he gave an entirely
different interpretation from his role
in the first play, a difficult task for
any actor. Mr. Dilienbcck lost his
hat and his accent early in the play.
and his voice was a bit too boyishly
petulant for the age be portrayed.
His pantomime in many instances
was admirable. Mr. Vose was not
consistent in his revelation of the
poetic soul.

NEWS Is Buried
—But Not Dead!

Many have expressed the de-
sire, at one time or another, that
the News be buried. as in a tomb-
stone. Rather than tombstoning,
we are cornerstoning, as this
issue of the STATE COLLEGE News
will be preserved ad infinitum in
the cornerstone of Sayles Hall, a
fitting tribute.

Other items to share the honor
are the dorm issue of the Alumni
Quarterly, (1 list of people who
have contributed and pledged
their support, and other articles
yet to be chosen.

“May it never be said the News
didn’t do its bit in supporting the
new dorm.”

To Slash Budget

Student Association to Discuss
Reduction in Appropriations,-
Total to Hit Record Low

The estimated budget for the 1941-
42 year will receive its public dis-
cussion at the Student Association
meeting of April 4, the Student
Board of Finance announced today.
At that time. a hearing will take
place in assembly on the various
items in the budget.

Organizations are to submit by
March 19 itemized accounts of their
estimated expenditures for next year
to Finance Board, which is faced
with the problem of cutting this
year's budget of $12,987.60 to a figure
a little above $10,000.

The hearing in assembly is to be
held to give the student body a
chance either to defend or to cut
proposed appropriations in the budg-
et.

Registration Lower

The large decrease in funds which
will be available for organizational
expenditures next year is being caus-
ed by several factors. The most im-
portant of these is that next year.
due to the fact that there will be
three classes in the college with only
250 members each. undergraduate
registration will be the lowest that
it has been in the recent history of
the college. Less than a thousand
students are expected to be enrolled.
Collections Incomplete

Also a contributory cause will be
the fact that never in the history of
the Student Association have student
tax collections reached 100%. Be-
cause of this, the budgets every year
have been cut. This year the budget
will be planned with the prospect of
an incomplete tax collection in mind.

The large reduction in available
funds will necessitate sharp curtail-
ment of the money alloted to the

various organizations.

ing the committee planning the tea.

Combs urges all students and fa-
culty to drop in. adding that there
may be surprises.

pices of Dramatics and Arts Asso-
ciation. Student tax tickets are now

State Will Witness
Tragedy, Light Opera

The BMI-ASCAP feud may
have resulted in the revival of
Gilbert and Sullivan, but State
has been producing the operettas
of these merry gentlemen for
many years. “H. M. S. Pinafore,”
or the tale of “the lass that loved
a sailor," will be presented by the
Operatic Society under the dir-
ection of Dr. T. F. H. Candlyn on
March 27 and 28. In this nautical
setting admirals and sailors in
straw hats will work for national
defense in the time of Queen Vic—
toria.

Do you want to stand on a
corner? Then just try out for
one of the 41 parts in “Street
Scene." by Elmer Rico. the play
which has been chosen by the Ad~
vanced Dramatics class as its
annual spring production. Miss
Agnes E. Futtercr, director and
producer of this example of ex-
pressionism. announces that try-
cuts will be open to those outside

Ex-Scouts Sponsor
Various Activities

I Weylend Will Address Group,-
DeLaney Backs Room Survey

Benson Tybring, '42. newly elected
president of the State College Service
Fraternity announced yesterday that
two activities are on that group's
program for the coming week.

Opening the week. Dr. Roy 0. Wey-
land, director of education of the
National Council of the Boy Scouts
of America will address the members
of the ex-Boy Scout group Monday
noon in the Lounge of Richardson
Hall.

Dr. Weyland, who is on a national
tour in the interests of Boy Scout
work, is coming to State from New
York City. Because of the fact that
he is a member of the National Board
of Directors of Alpha Phi Omega,
his speech at this time assumes a
particular importance to Service
Fraternity members. The State or-
ganization recently applied for a
membership charter in Alpha Phi
Omega, a national fraternity com-
posed of former Boy Scouts.

Second item on the Service Fra—
ternity calendar is the inspection of
men’s private rooming houses. This
inspection, which is being carried
on under the direction of the office
of the Dean of Women. will be con—
ducted under the chairmanship of
Robert Bunn, ’42.

Library School Plans Tea

Miss Esther Stallman, Professor
of Librarianship and acting-head of
the Library School, has announced
that all students are welcome to at-
tend the Library School tea, to be

held in the Lounge, Monday at 4i

P.M

 

A cub really leads a dog's life. He
comes down to the News office
Tuesday and Wednesday nights,
a-glow with eagerness.

He perches himself delicately on
the bench in the center of the Pub-
lications Office, and waits . . . and
nobody says anything . . maybe
they'll give him a two—line head to
write . . . it gets to be 10:30 p. m. . ..
and finally, he goes home sadly.
That’s what freshmen since time
immemorial have been accustomed
to do. But have you ever met any-
one in the class of ’44 who knew
enough to obey sensible customs?

Take the two girls who came
down to the News office for the
first time several nights ago. They
smiled beautifully at everyone and
if people weren't too busy. they
smiled back. After a long time Bet-
ty (Gravelle) and Janet (Baxter)
got tired of staring wide-eyed at all
this Glamor they'd heard about.
They decided to ask one of the
three associate editors for something
to do.

“Why, sure. kids." the editor
agreed, “Here's an idea for a swell
story: why don‘t you interview Gov.
Lehman?"

Such withering sarcasm would
ihaye melted any normal freshman.

 

 

   
 

Frosh Cubs Startle NEWS;-  
Twist “Scoop” Out of Joke

O

 

But that’s how this story happened:
these freshmen looked at each other,
stared again at their editor; yes.
he was joking. So at 10:30 p. m.
that night they phoned Walter
Brown, Secretary to the Governor,
and made an appointment for the
next day. What they did was fully
described in last week’s News. How
they did it—here’s the expose.

Janet: “We had our fingers cross.
ed as we waited. A group of politi-
cal ‘big-wigs' were sitting around
looking Important because they were
on matters of state; but then, so
were we.”

Betty: “Governor Lehman put as
completely at ease immediately by
rising and shaking hands with us.
Throughout the interview, he was
thoughtful enough to speak slowly
to prevent Janet‘s getting ‘writer’s
eramp.’ while I questioned him.

“When we had passed over such
technicalities as the European war,

We asked the Governor what he-

thought about State College. Said
the Governor, ‘I am proud of State
College.‘ I guess he knows, because
he was a guest speaker in our audi-
torium in April. 1038.

"What amazed Governor Lehman
most was the two-io—one ratio of
women to men.”
