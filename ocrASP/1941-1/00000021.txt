Concentration Big Factor

' In Basketball—Clair Bee

by Carl T. Marotto
LIU Coach Clair Bee, guest speaker at last night’s MAA awards
banquet, was overwhelmingly acclaimed for his versatility evrdenced
in the form of witty remarks and humorous recollections.

“Concentration ls the most impor- ?

tant thing in basketball,” said Bee.
"A coach doesn’t want a ‘jersey play-
er’—-one who throws the ball any-
where just to get rid of it.

“Spirit and perseverance are also
important considerations.
final analysis. it’s the spirit that
counts and lifts a team to greatness."

“Play to Win"

In a personal interview with a
News representative, when asked
for some of the factors which helped
his team attain its high ranking posi-
tion, he answered, “We don't got out
and play basketball just for the exer-

cise; we play to winl After all, if 
you don’t play to win, why keep."
score? The idea is to keep all the .7

players in the capacity of dangerous
threats, so that if one man is stopped,
another can break through and score.

“We simply want to be able to cope
with the other team's defense or
offense. Our object is to keep up a
normal offense that will give us about

45 points. and hold the enemy below 

40 points. At our best, we like to get

from 60 to 80 points. and keep thei
other team below this mark so that}

they will have to hurry their shots.”

Coach Bee felt that scholarship
was an important consideration in
building up a boy's character. He
went on to say that he believed “that
every American boy should have the
privilege of going to a small college."

Name Co-captains

Coach G. Elliott Hatfield presented
varsity and fresh basketball letters,
named the co-captains for next year
and read the 1941-42 basketball
schedule. The co-captalns selected
by this year’s lettermen are Hank
Brauner and Bill Dickson. Next
year’s cage card will provide much
in the way of a challenge to State
college basketeers to produce their
best.

Clay Spl‘owls, ’42, was selected as
varsity basketball manager, and Al
Stiller will take over the managerial
duties of the frosh team.

News notes from hither and thith-
er in the State sport world:

State's first line of defense. the
plucky chess team, will be put to
another test of Its thus far Hercu-
lean strength when the brain boys
tangle pawns et a1 with Cooper Un—
ion on the local squares this week—
end. State brains will be humming
furiously in an all out effort to cop

 

in New York City.

Since the organization of the
chess squad two years ago, the
group has won the reputation of be—
ing the most successful athletic (7)
outfit on the campus. Including the
defeat suffered at the hands of
CCNY last week. the pawnpushcrs‘
record to date stands at eleven
wins and four losses—and that re—
cord has been established in compe—
tition with some of the East’s top

team to keep up our reputation in
sporting circles!

Hot off the wires of something or
other comes the flash that MAA
will cooperate with Beers, Inc. to
throw a combination sports night
and barn dance on April 26, a Sat-
urday night. In the past, sports
night. with cavorting in the gym‘
and commons. and the barn (lance
have been separate affairs. Under
the combo arrangement, a great
success is forecast.

Les Gerdts emphasizes that Page
Gym is open to all men of the col-
lege Tuesdays and Wednesdays at
4:30 for whatever they choose to do
during the pre-softball lull in the
intramural program.

Myskania, senior honorary cam-
pus leadership society, will waddle
onto the Page Hall court in its
bloomers tomorrow night to engage
the Frosh women in a battle to the
death. Dr. D. V. Smith, acting in his
official capacity as referee, will at-
tempt to control the furious en-
counter. At 7:00 P. M. the Sopho-
mores will play the Juniors in a
rivalry basketball game. At 8:00
P. M. the main event of the evening
will take place and from 9:00 P. M.
until 12:00 P. M. dancing will be en-
Joyed in the Commons.

From an unassuming beginning
has developed the monster enter-
tainment planned for tomorrow
night. Dr. J. Allan Hicks is coach-
ing the members of the Myskanla
Muscovites in the elements of the
1921 women’s basketball rules which
will be used for this game only.
These rules will be slightly modified
since they will be used only as D. V.
remembers them.

Dr. Robert W. Frederick will be
the official scorer for the game and
Miss Margaret Betz will be the
timekecper. The State College Band
will provide martial and pacific
music in the gym, while Ed Holstein
and his Discie Doodlers will provide
music for dancing in the Commons
from 9:00 P. M. until 12:00 P. M.

who have won fame and distinction
in many walks of life. Fearless Fred
Agne is the high scoring forward
who was the scourge of the Verona
team. Hoosegow Haller, late of the
Herkimer jail, will undoubtedly star
as president of MAA. Goon Child
Kusak of the Henrietta Kusaks will
jump center.

Mr. John A. Murray, who teaches
in Room 128 Milne, will be the oth—
er forward. His shooting eye entitled
him to the title of “terror of the
12:35 gym class” when he was a
freshman. If he retains but one iota
of his natural talent he can be
counted on for 70 or 80 points.
Musclchead McCreary of the Mon-
sey McCrearys is the mainstay of
the sextet by virtue of his making
the all-intramural second team.

Snooty-pants Smith can be count-
ed as a full fledged drawback since
he has played with the R—blcrs
for four years. Wearybottom Wal-
rafh is an unknown quantify with-
out a gavel and it is reported on
good authority that he will not be
allowed to take any such instrument
on the court with him tomorrow
night.
