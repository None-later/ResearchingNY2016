Empty Promises

To us familiar with the ways and wiles of politics
and politicians, the failures of successful candidates
to carry out the campaign pledges which helped to
elect them is nothing new. Last spring, the Student
Association voted down a spirited minority effort to
abolish these campaign speeches so famous for their
"words not deeds” character. The result was a flock
of empty speeches, empty promises, and empty per-
formances.

Foremost among the campaign promises was a
reform destined to centralize the finances of all ac-
tivities securing dinancial support from the Student
Association. Just what centralization was to involve
was not particularly well understood by either the
victorious or the defeated candidates. But——-—it being
a non—controversial nieasurc-——aH were for it.

Today Student Association finances remain as
ramshackle as over. The ﬁnances of the Association
proper have been administered admirably by a
hard-working Finance Board which unfortunately
remains purely zulministrativc in scope. liut finan-
cial situations within the various activities leave
much to be desired. We are further than over from
a uniform bookkeeping systom. The suggestion of
an annual audit by Finance lloard has remained a
suggestion. ltudgot requests of practically every
organization have boon raisod despite a steadily
decreasing otii‘ollincnl and an ignorance of the fact
that 1001? tax colloction would be guaranteed ncxt
yoar. lluplicalos of all organizational contracts, rc-
coipts, bills. olc. aro not on file with any central
agency. The ploa for mommy and the guidance in
facing a difficult financial yoar which should havo
emanated from Student (‘ouiiril is yot forthcoming.

organization elections. Molincax is

of these political interpretations although his opinions do not necessarily
reflect those of the STATE Common News.
State's political stage was set; twee

weeks ago by nominations for Stu-
dent; Association offices. Unique tn
the beginning because of hastily lin-
provised nominations. the scene re-
mains so because of the peculiar
nature of the nominational set-up.
The situation is unusual for two
reasons. First; is the absence of any
candidates for president from two of
state’s powerful campus organiza-
tions, KDR and SLS. Second is the
College House dark horse candidate,
Vincent Miller.

Passow to Run

The most significant aspect of
the election preview thus far is the
decision of Harry Passow to remain
in the running as a presidential
possibility. Although they have not;
done so at this writing, Henry
Brauner. and Bill Dickson may be
expected to withdraw for it is im-
probable that Kappa Beta and Pot—

a personal analysis of the forthcoming Student Association, class, and

 

given the widest latitude as author

 

sizeable independent vote. If Tib-
bctts wins, his victory may be de-
cided by the women‘s vote. Miller’s
public life at. State has been con-
fined to the stage and it is doubtful
whether such experience is suffi-
cient to train him for the presidency
of the Association. So much for the
presidency.

Vice President From Three

A tln'ee-cornercd race for the vice-
presldency appears evident with in-
cumbent secretary Don Vanas op-
posed by KDR's hopeful “Curly” Tay-
lor and EEP’s Jim Portiey. Taylor
is a likely possibility because of his
presidency of the sophomore class.
Vanas has in his sccretaryshlp a
traditional springboard to the vice-
prestdency. However, traditions have
been broken before.

 

ter Club will back two men, espe-
cially two MAA possibilities.

Ralph lebetts by virtue of his
comfortable ascendancy via Secre-
taryship and Vice-Presidency of the
Student Association seems a likely
man for the job. If it had not been
for Passow‘s decision to run Titchth
would have had his way clear to
the presidency. Pessow is a definite
threat because of many contacts
with students as head of the Stu-
dents Part—Time Employment Bu-
reau. as a three-year man on the
SrA’ric COLLEGE News, as chairman of
the Junior Guides, and as a speaker
whose debating ability landed him
a seat on Debate Council. John
Ralph and A. Harry will fight it out
in the last analysis.

The Miller threat is more of a
threat to Passow than lebetts. A
vote for Miller is a vote for Tibbctts
or against Passow, depending on
your point of view. Tibbctts will be
defeated only if opposed by one
candidate. Either Passow or Miller
will have to withdraw. Passow seems
to be the only man who can beat
Tibbetts.

College llousc - SLS Axis

Miller will be strongly backed by
College House. The big question
mark is the strength of the rumored
Sigma Lambda Sigma-College House
axis. The mutual swapping of Van-j
its-Miller votes may prove interest-
ing. Reports of an extensively plan-
nod campaign for Miller coincide
with similar plans for Passow. Pas—
sow can count on 1006/. support. of
Kappa Beta and strong support.
from every other group on tho cam—1
pus. He should make drastic in-t
roads on the Gamma Knp, Newman‘
Hall, Junipors, Kappa Delta Rho.
and Sigma Lambda Sigma votes.
Pottor Club is by no moans unani-
mous in its support of ’l‘ibbotts ’as-
sow has a definite appoal to tho

 

I

 

Taylor, an ex-Collcge Houser. may
experience the unpleasantncss of
his old homestead entering a com-
bine against him to give Miller a
fighting chance for the presidency.
But then Vanas ls Collage House.
The Central Avenue boys cannot sc-
cure victory at the polls without
desertlng at least one of their candl-
dates. Will the KDR boys at CH for-
sake their fraternity brother, Tay-
lor, for their bunkmate, Miller? Will
Passow’s friends in Sigma Lambda
Sigma vote for Miller if this rumor-
ed deal goes through? Those are
some of the lmpondcrables of State
politics that make them interesting.

Potter Club has two men nomin-
ated for the vice-presidency, Lynch.
and Poi‘tlcy, with Fccney recently
withdrawn. Wlll Potter support
Lynch or will Portlcy. now promin-
ent in Finance Board, get EEP‘s
bid for political fame? Bora. an in-
dependent, seems to have a scant
chance in this weltcr of candidates.
Secretarysliip Obscure

Most obscure of the throc major
Student Association contests is the
race for the sccretai'yshlp. From
the thirteen candidates originally
nominated. it seems probable that
the fight. will narrow down to Pat.
Latimcr or Pat. Carroll, Bill Forrest,
and Bob Combs. Potter Club's
Combs, president of the Fresh “Life
is Very Dlilcront Club",wlll undoubt—
odly make the rovotcs. It is assumed
that KDR will back Forrest on the
strength of his one-vote loss of the
Freshman class presidency last
fall, but Fred Beyer may still got
the nod. A week should dcoldo this
question. Likewise Chi Sig must.
cliooso botwoon Carroll and lattimor.

We'll Take Fifteen

The Communism——

Annual revision of Inter-Sorority Council Regulations
ordinarily is no great cause for disturbance. Chief
changes last year were the abolition of Inter-Sorority
Tea and of favors from the formal dinner. One was
a tremendous output of energy, the other a needless
expense; neither removal was generally regretted.

Great was the discussion, therefore. when the nine
existing sororities learned this week that 1941-42 would
inaugurate a maximum limit for pledging. This is
the first time a line has ever been drawn at; State
though it is an accepted practice at other American
colleges. It sounds like an eminently sensible move.

The whispered gospel of all sorority members at;
State is that factors are working more against per-

petuation of the sorority system than

 

Fifteen for it. Here is a measure that should
Pledge contribute largely to a muoh-necded
Maximum leveling of membership. Sororities at;

State are more in the descendency than
they were three years ago. Seine sort of regulation by
the representative Council is desirable. even essential,
if the present status qiro is to be maintained. It is
likewise a fact that enough women in school want
to see a continuance of sororities, to the point of
regulating operation.

After a deluge at the dorm last fall when invitations
to sorority functions arrived, it was apparent. that
something had to be done. “Something” has been done,
but it. remains to be seen whether it is successful. The
new rush rules include a ten day silent period beginning
Saturday morning with the coming of invitations and
ending with the pledge service a week later. Time
out is taken for formal dinner and buffet supper. This
period should certainly eliminate the difficulties
caused by rival sorority girls trying to make up con-
fused freshmen minds. Rushces can return invitations
with replies which are completely a product of their
own feelingwand not the result of desperation.

During the following week. freshmen will be per-

mitted to live their own lives. instead of

Heated being overwhelmed with attention. The
Rushing heated last-minute rushing. formerly
Eliminator] common during thesis week. will be ab-

solutely impossible under the new ruling.
The woman’s privilege of changing her mind may be
exercised to its fullest extent by next year’s sorority
dcmandccs.

The rule directed at dormitory activities after five
o‘clock should do much to alleviate tense feelings
between members of various sororities. This rule will
ban all night sessions, “cake and coke" parties. and
sorority sings. No more will sorority girls hold quiet
chats with prospective pledges holiiiirl loo/cod doors
until 4 A. M. instead, everyone can catch up on
needed sleep and assignments long overdue.

Next year the fresh girls will be dealt several aces
instead of jokers. Despite disadvantages to several
sororitios the girls, on the whole, will be benefited.

Good luck to the poor pledges of ’45”
