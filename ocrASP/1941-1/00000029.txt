STATE COLLEGE NEWS, THURSDAY, APRIL 3, 1941

J.R.M.
We Liked Bee

Those who missed Clair Bee’s re-
marks at the MAA banquet a week
ago today did themselves a great in-
Justice. He’s one of the most inter-
esting after-dinner speakers we've
ever heard, and from the alternate
aisle-rolling and rapt attention that
was so prevalent that night, we
gather that most opinions will coin-
cide with our own.

One particular point of Coach
Bee's made at one of the serious
Junctures of his talk, impressed us
rather deeply and seems worth pon-
dering a moment. Said he. with
reference to State, “Every Ameri-
can boy should have the privilege of
going to a small college". Drawing
from his early experience at a cer-
tain big university. he defined a
professor at such an institution as
“a fellow who talks for .an hour and
then runs". He hailed the small
college as a place where closer. more
democratic relationships between
student and teacher make for more
practical training.

If a sports editor may be permitt-
ed to wax educational, we’d like to
expand Coach Bee's remark with
emphasis on the local scene.

State should feel proud that it has
so much of the democracy that Bee
admires and considers so vital to a
real college education. Evidences of
the existence of such a spirit are
manifest everywhere—both iii the
classroom and outside. But have we
reached the desired peak? Arc stil-
dent-faculty relations at State as
close as they might be and should
be? Though the trclid is unmistake-
hly in the right direction, there's
still a great deal to be hoped for.

One of the biggest obstacles to
student-faculty democracy is the
warped idea that any friendly ad-
vance toward a teacher is a care-
fully planned attempt to “apple-
polish". Such an idea makes the
teacher wary alid the student cor-
respondingly hesitant.
barrier of suspicion that must be
smashed before anything llkl norm-
a1 student-faculty friendship can en-
sue.

And now, having waxed educa—
tional we wane, firmly convinced
that Clair Bee klioWs what he's talk-
ing about ill more fields than has-
ketball.

Baseball at Ridgeiield

Lou Greenspan. fiery manager of
the baseball squad. flashes lls the
word that the 1941 diamond battles
will be waged at. Ridgefield Park.
Ridgei'lcld will also be the site of
pro-season ilil(l between-game prac-
tice llilllieuvers. In the past. the
diamondecrs have been t'oi'ccd to
devote a large slice of tllclr energy
to lighting neighborhood llrclllns
for possession of l'lcvcl'wyck Park
for practice. With this energy pre-
served. a hot season is forecast.

Page, seven are veterans of previ-
ous years; six are freshmen; four
come from the sophomore class; two
from the junior class; and the re-
maining six from the senior class.

Greenspan stressed the point that
all positions on the team roster are
still open, and any men of the col-
lege who have had experience still
stand a chance to secure a berth.
The regular squad usually numbers
about 15 members.

The men who came out are: Larry
Balog. Charley Bennett, Hal Duffey,
Vince Gillen, Pete Stanger. and Bill

 

1Vero, sophomores; and Harold Ash-

The Myskanla Muscovites am-
bled on to the Page Hall Gym on
the heels of the bathrobed Fresh
Amazons amidst peais of laughter
from the many spectators Sat-
urday night.

But this demonstration was
slight in comparison to the ova-
tion accorded Dr. D. V. Smith
when he appeared in his football
helmet, navy blue Jacket, stiff
slilrt front, and white trousers,
topped off by an enormous cigar
protruding from his smiling lips.

The big stunt of the evening
occurred just before half-time
when the team members disap-
peared In couples, returning
smeared with lipstick. D. V. also
shared the same fate—lucky

man.
Incidentally—did you know that
despite the 99-9 scoreboard re-
port, Myskania actually won
15-9?

With the opening of Spring sea-

mid-winter season which was only
partially successful. Seine of the
blame may be laid on Ole Man

of the latter is volleyball. Rose

captains, Were forced to wait until
4:30 before they could obtain the

explained ill a previous issue.

On the other hand botll badmin-
ton aiid ping pong proved very
popular. The ping pong tables were
in constant demand with a waiting

The advent (i’) of spring bringslthose girls who were seeking credit

for skiing and tobogganing. Dottie

few people did obtain credit on their

Folk dancing, under the direction

of this pastime.
