Coach G. Elliott Hatfield recently I

made public the 1941 edition of thefTennis Team Shows

State College varsity baseball sche-
dule. The card features twin con-
tests against three old-time rivals,
RPI, Hamilton, and Pratt Institute.

All in all, the local lads will play
six ‘contests in about three weeks.
The opener takes place with RPI at
Troy on May 7th. What would ordi-
narily be a home contest for State
will be played on a neutral diamond
in Troy on May 14. Home games will
be played on the 16th and 23rd of
May against Hamilton and Pratt
respectively.

Prospects Uncertain
A quick perusal of the game card.
reveals that the statesmen have no
simple job to bring home the bacon.
Unusually favorable weather dur-
ing spring recess gave the State Col-
lege baseball candidates an excel-
lent opportunity to get in some
practice earlier than was expected
this year, according to the statement
issued by Larry Balog, captain.

In addition Balog announced that
Walt Daniels. another veteran of
three previous years’ experience has
tossed in his cap for consideration
for a berth on the team roster.

Daniels is one of State’s finest
catchers and will be seeking his oldI
position behind the plate again this
year. His slugging ability has won
him distinction among his fellow
teammates in the past.

Team Yet Unnanounced

As yet the team has not been se-
lected. However, since the weather
has turned out so ideally, spring
practice is going at full speed, and
the team is likely to be announced
very soon.

State sports have again lapsed into
that traditional spring lull which

places the sports editor in the em-
barrassing position of having noth-
ing to spout about—assuming, of
course, that he does have something
to say otherwise. At any rate, we‘ll
do our best under the circumstances.

As far as the great majority of
the student body is concerned, ath—
letics for 1940-‘41 are finished. As

Despite our poor showings in the
past on the diamond, we see no good
reason why home ball games cannot
enjoy a student interest rivaling
that of the court clashes in Page

possessing a collegiate atmosphere,
while its students are unwilling to;

If the student body has no yearn-

Nelson Clarifies
Activity Outline
For Filth Year

Professional Duties Will Take
Grad Interest 0" Campus;
AII Should Have Training

 

 

Announcement of details of the
Five-Ycar-lei in last week‘s
NEWS. by Dr. Milton G. Nelson,
Dean of the College. this week rais-
ed a storm of coininan on the place
of the fiflh your student in extra-
curricular activity.

Although he declined to decree
the amount of activity of the grad-
uates, Dr. Nelson said they "prob-
ably would iiot want to partici-
pate" in extra-class activities as
they are now organized.

Arrange Year's Study

Reason for his statement is the
arrangement of the fifth year of
study. “It seems likely that the in-
tensively professional nature of
the graduate year will automatically
divorce the student from his former
interests.

Class schedules for the graduates
may differ from those of the rest of
the college.

One strong argument advanced in
favor of the participation of grad-
uates is their experience and ma-
turity of judgment.

Extra-Class Activities Needed

“That is exactly why I hope grad-
uates will be ineligible for any stu-
dent offices." Dean Nelson com-
mented. “We consider participa-
tion in extra-class activity invalu-
able in the development of ale un-
der-graduate. If graduates weri al-
lowed to retain the offices they they
hold in their senior year, or to be
named for new ones, they would
soon supplant fhe underciassmen
who should be getting that execu—
tive and administrative experience.

“However I do believe the grad-
uate class should develop extra—
class organimifions of their own. The
most beneficial. as far as their pro-
gress is involved. would be profes-
sional. W.- don’t want to say that
the colorful pleasures of their col-
lege yciirs tiri- ovcr. but. ill the fifth
year. it is time people began to take
a dif‘fcrcnl and more professional
viewpoint" ,
