A Man's World

The Board of Directors deserves congratulations
for its wisdom in instituting a liberal policy of regu-
lations in the new dorm.

Following the philosophy of other colleges, men
living in Sayles Hall will have no restricting hours.
As the dorm is to be run for and by the men, all
regulations will be self-imposed. Ail strict formal-
ities that seem ridiculous as well as odious will be
dispensed with.

Men living at the dorm will have a chance to de-
fray expenses with the waiting, cleaning, and clerical
jobs available. Men filling these jobs will keep
them only as long as their work is efficiently and
thoroughly done. Sayles Hall is to be the epitome
of efficient management. Having seen the slip-
shod way in which group house jobs are often passed
over, this is distinctly a change for the better.
Recognizing the ill effect of freshmen attempting
to swing too much in the first year, those in charge
have stated that the jobs will be filled by upper-
classmcn, unless special permission is granted.

All complaints of the occupants will be frankly
discussed in open meetings. This will prevent the
“‘back-room criticism” that has always plagued
house—managers. With Iiulger as director, students
may be assured that all reasonable complaints will
be remcdird. In Saylcs Hall there will not be the
regrettable breach between the students and the
director that all too often leads to dissatisfaction
and discontent in controlled group—houses.

Room and board at the new dorm will be $9 per
week. As the men‘s group-houses charge only $8,
there is no reason why they cannot successfully
compctc. Women’s group~houscs feel no ill-effects
because of i’icrcc Hail, and in many of these the
“ante” is over $8 per week. These ﬁgures alone
Should be enough to soothe the anxieties of the
rcn'Iaining few who fear that present group-houses
for men are doomed.

The new dorm will do much to lilit‘VilllI.‘ lament-
able housing conditions for men. Unifying the
freshman class, and in all probability becoming the
off—campus center of college lliif, Snyics Hail must
not fail the social as WI-il as housing l‘t‘SlltIilSlilililiCS
thrust upon it.

 

Puritans in Babylon

It is a iong-uwuichl pleasure to hear that at last
a freshman camp is being run for the freshmen. The
change from a gay weekend for the upperciassmen,
with more or less subtle rushing their foremost in-
terest, cannot come too soon.

“Frosh Camp” will soon fulfill its original pur-
pose—“to 1101/) the freshmen.

  

State's Refugee Problem

Commuters, Costs, Cott

 

 

The Commentmter

It cannot be doubted that: the fraternities and
sororities at State College are not wholly desirable
groups. It cannot be doubted that by their dabbling
in State politics they practically control them. It
cannot be doubted that their rushing activities cause
a decrease in interest in classroom work both among
their members and among the freshmen being rushed.
It cannot be doubted that there are many things about,
them that make them undesirable. ‘

At the same time, it cannot be doubted that they
are at State College an indispensable part of the life
of the students who belong to them—a port that
could not be done away with without creating any ill
effects.

It must be realized first that roughly 60 per cent
of all the students at State are affiliated with a fra-
ternity or'a sorority. For these students—a majority
of our undergraduates—their organization forms the
nucleus of their life at college outside of the class-
room.

This is important in view of the fact that about;
half of the students at; State are commuters. Socially
this is a much more important fact than it seems to
be on the surface. As far as classes are concerned,

it makes no difference whether a stu-

Frnternlty dent lives at home or not. If he or she
Commuters must commute from one of the Capi-
Mainstay to] District cities daily, the only effect

of his non-residence at the college is to
make him get up earlier in the morning so that; he
may travel to Albany in time for his classes. After
classes are over with, It; becomes an entirely different
matter. The commuter is now a. lost soul.

The commuting student is condemned to virtual ex-
clusion from extra-class activities for reasons that;
are obvious. If he wishes to stay late for a play re-
hearsal. he must find a place to eat. a place to stay
until the time of the rehearsal, perhaps a place to do
a little homework in the two or three hours at his
disposal, and. most important, he must find some
method of getting home at a reasonably early hour.

There is no way in which the average independent
commuter can do this. No one wishes to start a 20 or
30 mile trip home at 11 P. M.-—and not many do. In-
stead. most of State’s non-fraternity commuters prefer
to remain outside the sphere of extra-class activities.

It is obvious then that the fraternity and sorority
are of necessity the center of the out-of—towner’s so-
cial and extra-class life. It is the only agency that
can give him all that courses can not. His brothers
are the only ones to whom he can turn for help or
for companionship. His fraternity rightly becomes
something without which he would be lost.

This function of drawing together the students of
the college, of forming friendships, of providing a

means for a reasonable social life. of

Perform giving the lone student a home and a
Vital definite connection in Albany. is per—
Function haps the most important thing that

the Greek-letter groups do on our
campus. There are at this time barely enough such
organizations at State to do the job well—perhaps
not even enough. Even next year, when there will be
two dorms on the campus, many students would find
themselves alone if it were not; for their fraternity.
No matter how many dorms are built. there will still
be room for the fraternity which will provide the
lone student with everything he cannot find else-
where.

There is at; the present; a bare minimum of Greek
letter organizations on the campus. If their number
were to decrease further, the students of the college
would inevitably suffer. It must be noted that in the
past few years. several of these organizations have
dropped from campus. At the present time, two or
three more are in imminent; danger of passing out of
existence. For the good of the college. they must be
preserved. They must be preserved even if the admin-
istration must step in to do it. It is futile to deny that
at the same time they must be regulated to insure a
more even distribution of new members or to eliminate
their political meddling. but just as undeniable is the
fact that for the good of the college which they serve.
they must continue to exist.
