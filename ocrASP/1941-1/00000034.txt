Don't Mortgage the Futurel

This has been a year of recurring ﬁnancial crises.
First it was the imposition of National Defense
taxes, then it was the Finance Board budget cuts,
ﬁnally it was the setting of the Student Association
budget; now Dramatics and Arts Council has been
smitten. With the ﬁnal draining of its financial
reservoir, D & A has been forced to borrow money
from a “private source” to pay for Street Scene, its
final production. This most recent ﬁnancial head-
ache has been aggravated by the fact that Council
has no visible means for repayment of the $120 it
has borrowed. '

D 81 A this year has run the gamut of ﬁnance.
The days were prosperous indeed when Otis Skinner
yielded a proﬁt which was turned over to Student
Association cheerleaders. This was consistent with
D & A’s policy of returning all proﬁts and surpluses
to Student Association. Now there are no more sur-
pluses and D & A faces a critical period.

National Defense taxes have placed D 81 A
Council in the awkward position in which it finds
itself today. When this year’s budget was drawn
up, there was no provision for defense taxes. Little
by little, taxes ate into D & A funds, and now the
funds are gone.

What should be done? This much is certain. The
debt of $120 must not be carried over to next year.
The future must not be jeopardized by the debts
of today. There must be no mortgage hanging over
next year’s Council to hamper its activities. The
debt must be paid this year.

This may be done by either of two methods: by
Obtaining a grant from the Student Association
“untouchable” surplus of $300 or by charging ad—
mission to Strcr'i .S'rcnc. inasmuch as 1) 8: A has
been turning profits from its production ovcr to
Studcnt Association, there is small reason that there
should not be reciprocity. 'l‘hc “untoucintbic” sur-
plus was designed for emergencies. This is an emer—
gency. in addition, the surplus has been guaran—
teed for the future by the compulsory payment of
student tax. If this plan proves impossible, the
alternative is to charge admission at Street Scene.

This is no time for recrimination. The student
body cannot disassociatc itself from i.) 81 A’s crisis.
The problem of any om- uctivity in the college is
the problem of the whole coilegc. .‘\ debt of i) a A
is the, debt. of the entire student body. However
I) a A solves its probiemwby a grant from asso-
ciation funds or by charging admission at Street
St'l'llt,’ it must huvc student support.

Chem Club Experiments

State College cxtra~class educational precedent
has been shattered, and startlingly enough by a de-
partmental chib. Chemistry (.‘iub gave its members
a chance to learn smoothing first—hand about the
all—important Regents i‘lxaminations. This source
of knowledge came from the State Supervisor of
Science, lir. Ellis Manning, in a talk Tuesday night
from eastern and central New York State. It is
true, that many in attendance did not agree fully
with all that Dr. Manning said, but the fact that
they heard his viewpoints on such a vital question
is indeed an excellent step forward.

IBusy. Over a thousand students at state College
will admit that- they 'are busy—too busy for many
things they would like to do, like to see, like to say.
Why is this true not only of this college but of others
throughout the nation. Are students too busy with
academic pursuits. too engrossed in social activities?
No, the main reason is that like oysters, We are liv-
ing in our respective shells, in this case State Col-
lege, and have not yet gained sufficient maturity to
emerge as adults, to put aside trivial matters, and to
lIVe in the present.

As a whole we are absorbed in the activities of our
own small sphere. Students dash to
Tempest classes, then to the Publications office
In A or the Commons, and if necessity
makes it inevitable, to the library to
skim through the last assignment be-
fore the bell tolls the approach of an oncoming class.
Interest and activity lies in and about the college it-
self and in the people with whom we come into con-
tact. Our horizons have not been sufficiently broad-
ened, so that as the result we are not; intelligently
interested in the outside world or in problems of the
present day.

We are living in a time of crisis. This moment in
the cycle of life is being balanced on the scales of
fate. No matter what the result of the present inter-
national crisis. a different world awaits the outcome.
These changes may take place within a generation,
for we are faced not; by a war between nations, but a
social. economic, and political world-wide revolution
Now is the time to learn, plan. and prepare, for when
adjustment must be immediate. it is too late for
planning. The individual himself has a role to play,
for each must have his masterplan or philosophy of
life, which must be dynamic, not passive, compre—
hensive. not narrow. The fate of the world rests on
individual philosophy. Der Feuhrcr exemplifies this
point well. It remains for us to develop our democratic
doctrines as individuals. and to merge into the higher
concept of broader interests.

The world is crumbling around us, turning to dust.
ashes, and dirt. What are We doing? What are We
thinking: dates. bull sessions on sex. and if our minds

are perhaps inclined to soar, petty par-
Trivialities tisan polities. How many read the pap-
Fill ers intelligently? Only a few even
Minds bother to glance at the headline. and

Sunday's fare consists of Skippy. or
for those concerned with the future. Flash Gordon.
Do we read the latest modem novels, or non-fiction?
No, only those parts of the textbooks which are ab-
solutely required. Academically. we are engrossed in
the details of the feudal system of the reign of
Charles the Fifth. With the exception of the few tak-
ing courses in current events, the student body is
unlearned in affairs of the present.

Knowledge comes most swiftly when backed by
practical experience. Attempts such as the junior
visitation trips have fostered broadened activities.
Juniors have visited school systems, talked with prin-
cipals. teachers, and even janitors who are all on-
tirely divorced from our customary routine of life.
We have far too little of such enlarging experimenta-
tion. Sociology students should visit slum sections,
state hospitals. Indian reservations. Political science
students should visit the legislature, keep up on cur-
rent happenings. Impossible? No. For horizons can
be broadened even at State College. Attend de-
bates. Read avidly. Become an active participant
in the Forum of Politics. Emerge from your shells.
Meet life half-way. It is literally true that this
world is everything to us. if only we choose to make
11150,.” only we "Live in the Present" because it is

Just in case anyt’me thinks that:

the days of the pioneers are entirely
a thing of the past, it is now pos-
sible to present at State College a
living specimen of that hardy race
«one Charles Quinn.
Two weeks ago. Charlie went
pioneering —— to Whitesboro. His
trip lasted for four days. During
that time. Charlie became a teacher,
taking over a full teaching schedule,
("I taught five social studies
classes, a home room and a study
hall every day . . .”)

The whole story ties up with the
five-year plan. It is by now com-
mon knowledge that extended fifth
year off-campus teaching is being
contemplated. Quinn's trip was the

was sitting in front of him. She was
quite equal to; the situation. She

ear. It wasn't easy to keep from
laughing at that, but I put on as
straight a face as I could and
shouted, 'Cut that out.’ They must
haVe thought that I meant what
I said. For the next five minutes,
they had the most. solomn bunch
of faces that I ever saw.”

Charlie took over for three days
the entire teaching duties of one
of the school’s regular teachers.
“The girl had just been engaged,
he explains. “She was in no condi-
tion to teach. She was spending all
of her time up in the clouds."
During his stay in Whitesboro.
Quinn lived with two State grad-
uates who are teaching there now,
Tommy Barrington, ’36, and George
Mallinson, ’38.

Quinn stated that the most sur-

e?

was the attitude of the pupils. He
described them as not being as in-
telligent as those of Milne High, but;
all extremely interested. and always
