At Tomorrow's Festivities in McKown's Grove,-
Dickson and Forrest Head Soccer Squads

The third annual WAA-MAA

 
Rivalry and Soccer Games

'ra‘ ,9“-

Be Main Event of Outing

Playday will begin at 2 P. M.

tomorrow at McKown’s Grove. Co-chairmen Kay Peterson and Bill
Dickson, juniors, have prepared a full program which will carry
over into the evening. The highlight of the affair will be the rivalry
softball game between the frosh and sophomore men at 3 P. M. This

 

match will give the freshmen any?
opportunity to gain a lead of one-
half point, since the score now
stands 14-111/2 in favor of the sopho-
mores. ' >

An additional two points were
garnered by the class of ’43 Tues-
day afternoon when they succeeded
in pulling the frosh over the line
twice in a tug-of-war. The winners
used the same tacticS which brought
them success in their contest with
the present juniors last year. The
girls’ softball rivalry game which
was also scheduled for tomorrow
has been p05tponed until Monday
afternoon. The triumphant team
will receive three points for this
match. ,
Exhibition Soccer Game

A special exhibition soccer game
has been planned to introduce the
sport to those who never have seen
the game played. Bill Dickson and
Bill Forrest will lead two six-man
squads. Dickson is a veteran of the
Central New York State Soccer
Circuit, while Forrest boasts three
years of varsity experience in high
school.

Besides these two feature attrac-
tions, there will be other contests
in the afternoon—girls and boys’
soccer kick, baseball throw, and
other field day contests. Every type
of sports equipment such as soft-
balls and bats, badminton sets,
and horseshoes will be available for
use.

Bonfire Planned

In the evening there will be a
big bonfire under the pines where
hot dogs and marshmallows may be
roasted, followed by dancing to the
music of a vic in the Goblet danc-
ing hall.

There will be no charge for Play-
day, since everyone may get out to
the Grove via the Western Avenue
bus and everyone should bring his
own supper. Hot dogs and soft
drinks will be sold at the Grove.

Miss Peterson and Dickson will be
assisted by Arnie Ellerin, rivalry,

regularly plays high-ranking metro—
politan outﬁts.

State Chess Squad
Outclasses Colgate

A determined State College chess
team gained sweet revenge last Sun-
day when they swamped a 001—
gate squad to win the Upper Hud-
son Valley Chess League champion-
ship and the cup that goes with it.

Playing in top form, ,the States-
men defeated the Red Raiders by a
5-0 score. Jim Gillan broke all
known records at State by check-

 

and Owen Bombard and Win Jones,

l.R.M.

Orchids this week should be
showered down upon the brainy
brows of the chessmen, recent con-
querors of Colgate and champions
of the Upper Hudson Valley Chess
League by virtue of that conquest.
The 15-inch silver cup which ac-
companies the championship is a
tangible symbol of the great strides
which the pawnpushers have made
in their relatively brief existence
at State.
Plans made by the chess club for
next year would indicate that the
boys are aiming for even greater
strides in the future. A complete
reorganization of the club, from
which the team stems, has been
effected with the intention of “de-
mocratizing” the setup. More at-
tractive meeting programs will be
the theme for next year, accord—
ing to a spokesman of the organiza-
tion, and it is hoped that this re-
form will draw more non-team
member chess enthusiasts to the
get-togethers. Features intended to
spark the meetings include ten-
second matches (in which the par-
ticipants are allowed ten seconds
to move) and instruction for any-
one wanting to learn the game.
Affairs of the chess club and
team for next year will be in the
hands of Chess Council to be com-
posed of: Art Fox, club president
and team correspondent, Jim Gil-
lan. vice—president and team mana-
ger; Roy Sommers, tournament
director; Jim Wahler, radio chess
director; Gil Corbin, recording
secretary; George Erbstein, publi-
city director; and Clarence Oarr.

To 'Meet Pratt

Return Engagement Scheduled
With Engineers Wednesday,
Team Drops First Tilt

Coach G. Elliott Hatﬁeld’s base-
ball outﬂt will leave promptly at 7
A. M. tomorrow for their second
contest of the current season, booked
with Coach “Clip” McKillop’s Pratt
Institute lads on the latter’s field
in Bayridge, Brooklyn.

The statesmen will be out in an
effort to avenge themselves of two
defeats handed them by the metro-
politan nine last year. On their last
trek to the city, the locals lost by
a very close margin.

Pratt Unpredictable

It would require a lot of con-
jecture to make a prediction con-
cerning the probable results of to-
morrow’s game. Coach McKillop’s
boys lost to Stevens Tech by a score
of 3-2; and came back strong the
following game to shower Upsala,
30-‘7.

On Wednesday, May 14, the State
diamondeers will play their return
game with RPI. The game will be
played in Troy because of an agree—
ment to the effect made with the
Engineers, but it will represent the
“home” game for State in their

Kappa 138m. Who smothered the bookings with the Rensselaer team.

Lost First Game

Last Wednesday the local squad
busscd over to RPI and were shaded
by the Engineers, 9-6.

Although the Trojans had the long
end of the ﬁnal tally, the State team
outhit its opponents. Rensselaer
garnered m05t of its runs on free
passes issued by Van Ellis.

D&A to Secure
Tax Exemption

For May Play

Appropriation from 1942 Budget
Will Meet Probable Delicit
From Spring Production

The financial situation facing the
Dramatics and Arts Council was
partially alleviated this week when
the group secured tax exemption
for Slrcc/ Scene, the annual spring
production of the Advanced Dra-
matics class. which is being spon-
sored by the council. This action
was secured by the efforts of Dor-
othea Mucisaac, '42. and Earle Snow,
'44, who arranged an appointment
with Mr. Hofflingcl' of the Internal
Revenue Department, which result-
ed in the granting of exemption on
the grounds of the educational value
of the presentation.

Shortage Due To ’I‘nx

Last week the council released the
information that it had been forced
to borrow a substantial amount in
order to sponsor Slrccl Scene, and
that unless a profit is made, the
necessary money will be provided
from next year's appropriation.

Strccl Scene, by Elmer Rice, will
be staged in the Page Hall auditor-
ium Thursday and Friday. May 22
and 23, at 3:30 P. M. This three—
act social drama, whiCh is under the
direction of Miss Agnes E. F‘utterer,
assistant professor of English, dc-
picts slum life in metropolitan New
York. Approximately 45 characters
appear in front of the apartment
house, the set being constructed by
Mr. William G. Hardy. Instructor
in English, and the Siagecraft class.

Thursday evening Miss Julia
Tunnel], '4], will render several out-
standing numbcrs, accompanied by

Retainers 01' half a student tax
ticket will have to pay a charge of

necessary because not enough money
was allotted to the Pcrlagoyuc by
the Student Association to cover
the cost of printing and publish-

A prc-Moving-Up Dny distribu—
