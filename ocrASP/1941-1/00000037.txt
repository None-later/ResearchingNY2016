llovcy. (.‘omrmlcs

Tomorrow the Class of '41 takes
the first step toward that oblivion
which rears its ugly head before
every class on the eve of its mov-
ing up and out. And with the Class
of '41, the humble proprietor or this
page takes his bow and steps aside.

To be reluctant is to be selfish.
Yet, we feel that even a sports ecli-
tor won’t be above feeling a sudden
urge for a vigorous noseblow to-
morrow night when the derobed
seniors start their traditional fare-
well trek down the steps of Draper.
On our freshman and sophomore

when they line up against a visit-,
ing Hamilton College nine at the,
Ridgefield Park grounds. The game
is scheduled to begin at 4:30 P. 

Last year Mox Weber‘s Hamilton-
ians took the measure of the local
squad by scores of 8-1. and 4-2. The
strength of Coach Weber‘s team this
year is an undecided factor, since
an accurate record of their current
performance is not available. These
two teams will again meet at Clin-
ton on Wednesday afternoon.

The Statesmen will be seeking
their first victory tomorrow, after
having been taken over the hurdles

epidemics of nasal congestion cans-
ed the black mass of caps and
gowns to be peppered with white.
As a junior, We thought We knewll
how the seniors felt. Now, as the-
end draws near. We're very much
afraid we're beginning to exper—
ience that same feeling ourselves. '

It seems only yesterday that our.
knees were beating a tattoo with'
fifty others (including Murray's) in
Doc Dorwaldt’s Hygiene class; thatl
a bunch of sophomores almost cut.
short our college career by dunkingl
us bodily into the shower; that wel
used to live our free periods in the
library; that D. V. Smith used to
scare us; that we played a sloppy
center field for the 12:35 gym class
. . . . . but we could drool on like
this for columns.

Gripe Department

We'd like to cull from our gripes
of the past four years a single item
which We've been wanting to get off
our chest for some time.

All the enlightenment which col-
lege offers in the art of living is
totally nullified by the individual!
who smugly parades about the cam-l
pus with his whole "personality":
wrapped around a well-polished andt
prominently displayed button on that
lapel. This fellow is the so-calledt’
strong fraternity man, and it seemst
to us that there are far too many
of his type for the good of State.

He loves his brothers; and there
all admiration stops. He laughs at
his brother's jokes. He lives like
his brothers. He inwardly. if nott
openly, hates his fellow organiza-l
tions. Fraternities and sororities
are indispensable, but the narrow-
mindedness which they tend to pro-I
duce should be fought . . . . from!
within.

We've seen countless friendships
transcending fraternity lines. There
should be more. As a fraternity,
member, We don't think we can bet
branded as prejudiced. Moreover,
believe it or not. we're sincere, and
not trying to be nasty! Enuf.

Democracy in MAA ‘

By the time of this writing. MAA,
Council has probably passed the‘
new Intramural Council set-up to}
take effect next year . . . . a drastic,
scheme aimed at democratizing the;
latter body. 1

Tradition has decreed that Intro—t
mural Council should be selected at
the discretion of MAA at the end
of the college year. Under this, LIIC‘.
old plan. the participating intra-
mural groups (Collage House, KDR,I
SLS, etc.) wcrc not all ncccssurilyi
represented. ,

The new ruling clearly states that
all college groups putting teams in
the football. baskt-tball. and soft-
ball leagues will rcccivu a scat. on
the council.

Chess, Statesman, Exit

Mcssrs. Knox and Stimson claim
that their departments form this,
backbone of American dcfcnsc, Wc‘d
likc to challenge that stand. Sat-
urday's vicious torpcdooing of thc
U. S. Navy by the chess team puts
the sccond major branch of thc‘
armed forccs on the pawnpusltcrs‘
vanquished list. The army was
knocked off last year. 3

We appreciated the parody of
this department which appeared in,
last week‘s Statesman. According
to Dr. Hastings. parody is the sym-‘
bol of success. Thanks. Blanche.

To the new board that will man
the helm next week . . . . lotsa luck]
So—long —-—— and 30. l

Pratt Game Close

The Pratt contest was a tough
one to lose. State played a good
brand of ball and led 5—3 until the
seventh.

In the 5th inning. with two
men on, and only one out. Pratt hit
a long drive into left field. Rich
Young snapped it up on the bounce.
and made a beautiful throw to cut
off a man coming in at the plate.
In the same action Daniels flipped
it to Bennett who relayed it back
and caught the second man at the

Awards, Food, Fun!
_ Come and Get Them

The annual WAA Spring
, Awards Banquet, the last get-to-

1 Thursday at Miss Johnston's
home. Armida Casline, general
chairman. stated that this year
the food and fun will surpass all
past banquets.

After the banquet, the old
council will formally install the
new council which will be an-
nounced tomorrow. Those juniors
with three years‘ sports credit

freshmen with credit in four

Tennis Team Beats
Connecticut State

The underdog State net squad
defeated the Connecticut State
Teachers. 8-1. last night on the New
England court. Connecticut had
previously beaten mighty Yale Uni—
versity's net outfit.

The netmen will play at RPI this
Saturday and will tackle Connecti-
cut in a return engagement next;
Wednesday at home. ‘

The contest with Norwich schc-‘
duled for last Friday was cancelled}
because of heavy rain after the
Siatesmen had taken the lead in
all five single matches. I

The squad played St. Peter‘s Col-‘
lege at Jersey City on Saturday and:
lost 5-3. The close fences and thc‘
veritable gale which blew con-’
sistantly cramped the Statesmen’sl

Freshmen Lead

As Rivalry

Sophomores ,
Draws to Close

 

by Carl T. Marotto

On the eve of the cessation of
Frosh-Soph rivalry one finds in—
terest in the outcome keynoted at a
high pitch. The reason for this is
easily explained—for the first time
since Grant marched into Rich-
mond, the remarkable train of
events at State finds that the “ver-
dant” freshmen are leading the
more experienced sophomores in
rivalry. At the present writing the
“little foxes" are pacing the enemy
by a score of 221.4; to 14%!

Last Monday night the frosh
Amazons blitzkrieged the Soph wo-
men With a 21-11 bombardment.
Later in the same evening the wily
frosh men slipped a 10-9 victory
past the collective nose of their
rivals. netting six points for the
winners for a whole day’s work.
However. confidence still reigns
in both armed camps.

Brief interviews with the man
t?) in the corridor and the girl in
the library resulted in the follow-
lng communiques: Pat Carroll. “My
thoughts on rivalry

shouldn‘t be '

Vprinted . . . they might be demoral-
izing to the sophs.” “Curly” Taylor,
"We ve been taking it easy just to
make it interesting . . . now watch
us. Wow!" Jean Harvey flashed in-
dignation as to the possibilities of
dcubt, “Of course we’ll win, nothing
to it." Flora Gaspary, "Well frank-
ly. . . . (two short laughs)”. Bill
Marsland bared his fangs and
growled. "We’ll tear ’em limb from
limb." Summary:

Surprises Creep
Into Ceremonies

Tradition once more returned
to stalk the boards at State as
next year's Myskania eleven
fell into formation on the
stage of Page Hall this morning.
Apparently much emphasrs was
|laccd upon “the surprise ele-
ment" as an important fac-
tor in the planning of this year's
ceremony. for the usual "presidency,
to presidency". “activity to activity".’
"fraternity brother to fraternity
brother" method of handing down
seats was conspicuously absent.
Passow First Tapped

As end man, McCreary began pro-
ceedings when he, escorted Harry
Passow, this year's head of the
PTEB, chairman of the Junior Guide
System, junior editor of the NEWS.
and member of Debate Council—as
well as the barely defeated candidate
for Student Association president.
Murray’s first trip to the floor of the
assembly resulted in the naming of
Paul Merritt. three year’s class presi-
dent, prominent varsity basketball
player. and member of Interfratcrn-
ity Council. As Stan Smith’s suc-
cessor, then followed Bill Dickson,
also a varsity basketball man, all
round athlete, and next year's presi-
dent of MAA.

Kay Peterson, SCA cabinet member,

Traditional Speeches
[inaugurate Moving-U p

This morning’s Moving-Up Day
assembly in Page Hall opened
with the traditional class
speeches.

Miss Catherine O'Bryan, speak-
ing for the seniors, denied that
this generation is the “lost gen—
eration," that there is nothing
to live for.

A. Harry Passow, '42. spoke on
the subject “A New Era for
State College."

Adding a light touch to the
addresses. Elizabeth Barden ded-
icated an ed: to the sophomore
class. To the senior class she
bid a fond farewell and took
pop-shots at the freshmen.

The vicissitudes of a fresh-
man from the day of his arrival
at State until Moving-Up Day
was the subject of the speech by
Bernard Skolsky, ’44.

Select Gaylord, Mattice, Young
For Class Vice-Presidencies

In Mediocre Vote Result

No new Student Council keys are
in order for class presidents this
year, for the results of the elections
show that all class heads have held
that office before. Paul Merritt has
been elected President of the Class
of 1942 a third time, Thomas Fecney
comes back as President of the Class
of 1943. and Patricia Carroll has been
re-elected President of the Class of
1944. Merritt rode into office with
a comfortable margin on the ﬁrst
ballot, while it took two voting ses-
sions to reinstate Feeney and re-
elect Carroll. About 143 juniors par—
ticipated in their class elections—a
low percentage compared to the 166
and 181 who marked ballots for the
sophomores and freshmen respec—
tively. In general rcvoto turnouts
fell off considerably.

The complete list of class ofﬁce
holders is as follows:

673 Cast Vote
In SA Elections

Students and guests filled Page
Hall to capacity this morning to
hear Merrill Walrath, president,
announce the results of the spring
elections. They heard that Ralph
Tibbetts would be the next presi-
dent, Don Vanas, vice-president,
and Patricia Latimer, secretary.
They did not hear that 673 stu-
dents, a record number according
to Myskania files, had participated
in the elections or that Tibbetts’
margin of triumph was a mere
.0078.

Presidential Photo-Finish

Three students decided that Ralph
Tibbets. '42, should be president of
the Student Association next year.
That is, if only three had changed
their vote Harry Passow would be
leading next year's assemblies. Pas-
sow assumed a commanding lead on
the first ballot while the Miller sup-
porters fell six votes short of placing
their “dark horse” candidate in re-
votes, eliminating the odds-on fav-
orite Tibbetts. In either instance,
had the blank voters cast their bal-
lot for the eliminated candidate the
result would have been changed.

 

President lor Commencement(?)

Mr. Newton B. Van Derzee,
chairman of the college Board of
Visitors, stated last Wednesday
that the appointment of a suc-
cessor to the late Dr. A. R. Bru-
bacher might be forthcoming on
June 16, Commencement Day.

Last fall Van Derzee said that
the naming of a president for
State College was being delayed
pending legislative action. Since
the adjournment of the Legisla-
ture. it has been impossible for
the board to meet inasmuch as a
majority of its members have been
out of the city.

Van Derzee denied that any rec-
ommendation had as yet been
made to the Regents of the Uni-
versity of the State of New York,
which body will actually name the
new president, acting on nomina—
tions submitted by the Board of
Visitors.

Don Vanas experienced little diffi-
culty in out-distancing a large field
seeking the vice-presidency. He
missed being named on the first
ballot by 29 votes. James Portley’s
prominence in the recent budget de-
bate hclpcd account for his very good
showing. Both Taylor and Lynch
polled well on the first ballot but
neither well enough to make the re-
votcs. Bora never had a chance.
Woman Shutters "Tradition"

For the first time in four years a
woman has been elected to a major
Student Association office. The wo-
man is Patricia Latimer. '44, and the
office that of secretary—Rita Sulli-
van won a similar honor in the Fall
of 1937 filling the vacancy caused by
Henry Taylor. On the first ballot
the election resolved itself around
Forrest, Latimer. and Snow. Lati-
mer's lncumbcncy as class vicc~presi-
dent and the fact that Forrest miss-
ed being president last Fall by but
three votes gained them the revotes.
This third ballot indicated forcibly
that the students were primarily in-
