College to issue
41 -43 Catalogue
in Near Future

Book Will Clear Up Questions
About Curriculum Changes;
Many Revisions included

The College Catalogue for the
years 1941-1942, 1942-43 will be off
the presses shortly and its ap—
pearance will clear up the questions
and rumors about new regulations
and courses which have been af-
fected by the five-year plan.

Certain regulations in the re-
quirements for the bachelor‘s degree
have undergone changes. In the
work of major or minor departments
“C” is the minimum passing grade.
There is to be an exception to this
rule: When passed by the head of
the department concerned and ap-
proved by the dean of the College a
grade of "D" may be balanced by a
grade of “B” or better earned in a
similar course or in an advanced
course that is based on the course
failed.

Ruling on lncompletes

A new regulation will be that a
student who receives an incomplete
in any course shall remove the in-
complete the following semester. If
not, the incomplete becomes an "E."

There is also an addition to the
requirements for admission: Funds
available in an amount sufficient to
maintain the student in college
without the necessity for outside
employment to a degree that is
dangerous to the student‘s health
or to scholastic accomplishment.

In the section on residence is a
new clause stating that freshmen
men are required to live at Saylcs
Hall or Thomas More House unless
granted special permission by the
Dean of Students to live elsewhere.
New Biology Classes

A number of courses have been
eliminated. and others have been
added to the curriculum. In some
cases a course appears under a new
name or a new head.

Courses in elementary physiology
and taxonomy (identification of vas-
cular plants). have been added to
the biology department. The Eng-
lish department will offer a course
on the contemporary American
novel (closed to majors and minors
in English) and a four hour course
on the poetry of Keats and Shelley.

Holstein Leaves Page
To ‘Meet John Doe’

Tapping did not end at noon
on Moving-Up Day for Ed Hol-
stein, tenth member of the new
Myskania, for Ed was tapped
again during the day but as
Ed Holstein, alias John Doe.

At exactly 12 noon he turned
to face the cheering crowd which
jammed Page Auditorium, and
then mysteriously disappeared.
Kidnapped? No, for Ed was
scheduled to appear at the corner
of State and Pearl streets at
12:10 as John Doe in a contest
sponsored by the Strand Theatre
and Times Union in connection
with the new picture “Meet John
Doe." In all, Ed handed out $25
in prizes and 25 passes to pass-
ers-by who recognized him. Thus
Holstein has taken his place with
Kusnk and Murray, State's gifts
to the American theatre.

Cornell Calls Another As Hardy

Prepares ior Two-Year Leave

Amidst the turmoil of hammer-
ing, shouting and sound effects was
Mr. William G. Hardy perched un—
stcadily on a high ladder, putting the
finishing touches on the tenement
for the Street Scam: production. “I'll
talk to you up here and no place
else,” he answered when he was
questioned.

Mr. Hardy, who was born in Cleve-
land in 1910. Went to school at Brown
University, and succeeded in obtain-
ing a position there after graduating.
Later he worked at various stations.
writing, directing. and acting in com-
mercial productions. He also helped
to broadcast children’s programs
and even “advice to the lovclorn."
At one time he wrote short plays for
Irene Rich, Well-known star of many
moving-pictures. These plays ad-
vertised grape juice. When asked if
he ever tried the product himself, he
nodded and said, “Yes, but it‘s too
expensive." While working on the
radio, he met the woman who later
became his wife. She happened to
be directing a production of David
Copperfield in which he played a
part. They have been married eight
years and have two children, a boy
and a girl.

After three and a half years of

 

.  .. ._..
radio work, he came to State, which

he considers an “exceptionally fine
place.” Realizing that. there are
many opportunities in radio, he says.
"I'm as i'mnous now as I chr want
to be." Incidentally, he likes teach—
ing better than radio work. He
believes that the speech of the stu-
dents is rather bad. When asked
what he likes best about the college,
he replied smlllngly. “the girls of the
student bodyl"

In his spare time he plays telniih‘.
builds furniture for his children, and
reads and collects llmcricks. Mr.
Louis C. Jones and he together own
a collection of linicrlcks, many of
which Mr. l-Iurdy admits are not fit
to quote. He also likes to sing in the
bath tub, but there only:

Mr. Hardy believes he will like
Cornell, for he considers it one of the
best of the Eastern colleges for the
study he Wishes to pursue. Although
a great deal of his time will be spent
in studying for his degree in rhetoric,
he will teach speech work to the
Cornell students.

Mr. Hardy is noted for his sym—
pathetic understanding of student
problems, He is known as a regular
guy. As one of the students express-
ed it, “Hardy understands."

New NYA Program

June 7 Fixed as New Deadline
For Fall Aid Applications

All students who wish to obtain
NYA aid for next year must have
their names and summer addresses
in the office of the Dean of Women
before June ’7. No grants can be
made before fall since no definite
allotment of funds has been made
to State College, Miss DeLaney an-
nounccd.

During the summer those students
who have filed requests for aid will
be sent application blanks which
must be filled out and returned to
the Dean of Women's office before
September 2. By doing this. it is be-
lieved that the student will be able
to estimate his resources and ex-
penses for the year more definitely.
Any student who discovers during
the summer that he will need aid
to continue in school may write to
the Dean of Women for an applica-
tion blank. A student who has
worked on N. Y. A. in the post does
not automatically receive a grant.

‘Strcet Scene’ Performance
Triumph of Acting, Directing

by Ruttray and Hertel
The meager audience that saw
last night‘s performance of Street

_. Scene witnessed a presentation that

was a tribute to the directing ability

I, of Miss Agnes Futterer. Faced with

the stupendous task of coaching
ﬁfty-six actors in a play which de-
pends for its powerful theme upon
the life-like portrayal of each char-
acter, Miss Futterer inspired in her
cast a. dynamic performance.

The curtain opened last night to
display a typical East side brown-
stone house. Throughout the entire
ﬁrst act, the audience remained
tense as the cast presented a vivid
picture of tenement life. The char-
acters played by Tom Vosslllew,
Anna Cattuti, Tom Augustine, Kay
Wilson, and Paul Barselou were
among the best acted that have been
seen in many a month.

Elmer Rice can be well proud of
the skillful development of his tragic
story of a wife whose jealous husband
discovered that another man was
providing her with the kindness
which he had failed to supply. The
play, however, is much more than
the conventional triangle; it is a
many-faceted accusation of human
nature.

The minor actors were invaluable
in their depicting of slum environ-
ment. The little touches proved the
excellence of the direction and
caused Street Scene to be a play
worth seeing.

Some criticisms are in order. The
portrayal of age was rather poor in
the case of Jordan and Keeler.
Miller’s poetic interpretation of his
part was not adequate. The raucus
horn in the sound effects should have
been squelched during the more dra-
matic moments.

A word of praise should be spoken
about the work of William G. Hardy
and the Stagecraft class. The set
they created is one of the best that
has ever been seen at State College.
