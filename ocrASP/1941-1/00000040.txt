in Final Gan"e

Hamilton Deleeie Sieie Twice;
Loss of Eight Regulars Will
Weaken Next Year’s Team

The Pedagogues will engage Pratt
Institute tomorrow in their final
baseball game of the season. The
contest will be played on the home
diamond at Ridgefieid Park at 4:30

M

 

P. .

Pratt defeated State .at Brooklyn
earlier in the year by a 10 to 5 score.
According to manager Lou Green-
span, “This game should tell a dif-
ferent story from the first. Balls
that hit the fence down there will be
long outfield flies at Ridgeiield Park.
If we can get consistent pitching we
should win."

The statesmen played their poorest
game of the season last Friday when
they lost to Hamilton College, 11 to
0. Hamilton’s moundsman, Young,
struck out twelve men and allowed
only one hit.

The statesmen lost a second game
—their ﬁfth straight for the season—
to Hamilton last Wednesday, 13 to 4.
With two away in the second frame
Hamilton went to work on Bob
Leonard and banged out eight runs.
After that Leonard pitched four
scoreless innings. but the game was
already on ice.

Eight of the men playing tomorrow
will be lost to next year's team. Cap-
tain Larry Baiog, Walt Daniels, Vince
Gillen and Les Gerdts have played
varsity ball for three or four years
and will be greatly missed. Hal
Duffey, Van Ellis, Pete Stanger, and
Charlie Bennett have been with the
varsity a shorter time but will be
Just as hard to replace.

Sophs Seek Revenge
- .For.Softball Defeat

The bitterness of defeat! The
sweetness of revenge!

The former pulled the poor
sophs down into the depths of
despair and hopes of the latter is
helping to sustain them through
the week until Wednesday at
3:30 in back of the library.

In other words, the sophomore
women, through their manager
Win Jones, have challenged the
frosh babes to another softball
encounter to try to erase the dis-
grace caused by the frosh victory
of 21-11, in their previous con-
test.

Rivalry may be decided. but
the sophs still have the spirit!
It ought to be good.

EEP Beats KB
ln Deciding Tilt

Potter Club came through yester-
day to score its sixth straight victory
and trounced KB, 12-5, in the game
which all but decided the league
championship. EEP needs but one
victory today over the weak Gophers
to clinch the loop title and ﬁnish the
season with a clean slate.

Bob Seifert pitched very effectively
and was never in trouble. The turn-
ing point came early in the game as
Ed Reed broke a 2-2 tie with a dou-
ble. After that KB’s usually tight
defense faltered and EEP romped to

We’ve seen countless friendships
transcending fraternity line. There
should be more.

With these parting words, Jim
Maloney, former pilot of this col-
umn. made his reluctant exit.

We, who slide in behind his desk
know only too well, that ours is a
big order to fill. We don’t expect
to spout sensational material. Our
interest is, of course, sports. If we
can do just a little toward further-
ing interest in State College sports;
not only an active interest, but a
clean fine, healthy unprejudiced at-
titude, then we’ll feel that our con-
tribution will register more than a
“No Sale.”

It was with this in mind that we
saw fit to re-print the leading lines
of this column. Such unbiased
words are too valuable to be forgot-
ten. Let us hope their message will
always be foremost in the mind of
every athlete at State.

In the Hamilton game last week,
visiting pitcher Young was well on
the way toward carving his initials
on the doorhandle to baseball’s Hall
of Fame. when Les Gerdts stepped
up to the plate and—you guessed
it— he got the only hit of the

victory.

College House broke into the win-
ning column yesterday with a close
victory over KDR, 11-10. In other
contests Potter swamped the Ram-
blers and KB outclassed KDR. The
Gophers dropped their third con-
secutive game to KDR, while SLS
won an easy one from the Ramblers,
23-4. a

game!

Budget Fails to Stop t
State’s Chess Squad

80 it’s economy you’re looking
for. Here’s one group in which
it will be hard to find economical
faults. Its none other than our
famous Chess Club.

During the past year the club
operated on a limited budget of
$150. The varsity team, while
compiling a record of 13 wins, 4
losses, and 2 draws, did a little
traveling. It journed over 2500
miles to points in New England,
New Jersey, New York City, West
Point, Hamilton and terminated
the season with a trip to Wash-
ington and Annapolis.

WAA Re-Eleciions Next Fall

Re-elections for three WAA of-
fices will have to take place next
fall since three women were elected
to two offices each. Class managers
for 1942 and 1943, and class repre-
sentative for 1944 are the offices to
be filled. The persons elected to
these positions were: Mary Susan
Wing, new vice-president; Winifred

-  Close of Schedule '

 

state's tennis team will round out
its 1941 schedule when it plays three
games within the next six days.

The netmen will swing into action
against a strong St. Peter's squad in
the first of the three matches this
afternoon at Ridgefield. Siena will
offer the opposition tomorrow after-
noon. This match will also be played
at home. ‘

The lone remaining game is a re-
turn match with RPI at Troy next
Wednesday. The Engineers upset
the applecart, 6-3, in their meeting
last Saturday.

However, the tennis team came
back strong to score its second vic-
tory of the season over Connecticut
State, 6-3, last Tuesday on the home
court. This brings the team's record
to three wins and two losses to date.
