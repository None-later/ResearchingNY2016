Contact Passow

For PTEB Jobs

All students interested in secur-
ing part time employment are ad-
vised by A. Harry Passow, Director,
to file applications immediately at
the Part Time Employment Bureau
desk in the Dean of Student’s of-
fice. Only persons who have filed
applications will be given jobs.

A social security number is re-
quired for each ar plicant. The
number is recorded on the upper
right hand corner of the PTEB
blank. Those who have not secured
a number may 1 so by registering
in room 622 at 90 State Street.

A complete check will be made on
every lead issued by the office.
Passow suggests that all students
receiving notices from the bureau
report to the PTEB office imme~
diately, as any delay will mean
losing that particular job and all
subsequent leads. Any student who
doesn’t report back the result of a
lead or who leaves a Job secured
for him by the bureau, will not be
recommended again.

Students with urgent need should
make an appointment with Harry
Passow, '42. or with any member of
his staff to make arrangements for
a special dispensation. A schedule of
hours during which the desk in the
employment office will be occupied
is to be posted at the desk the first
part of next week.

Don Vanas. '43, has recently been
appointed to the staff.

Ira the Chameleon —
Ado About the Hair-do

Jeannie had light brown
hair—so did Ira. Jeannie’s has
turned gray not so Ira’s. The
once chestnut locks have mira-
culously changed to a ravishing
blond.

Mr. Hirsh laughs off the phe-
nomena with an airy “Oh, the
sun did that."

But . . .

Natives of Africa and the
South Seas spend the greater
part of their lives in the sun:
blonds there are decidedly in
the minority. Chorus girls who
only receive the health-giving
rays when returning home from
a social evening range invari-
ably from a pale dishwatcr to a
shining platinum blonde. Easily
produced chemicals, notably
NaCCl, HCIO or even lowly
H202 (peroxide) would, when
applied externally, turn the
blackest crow into a canary.

Farrell Mansion,
Recent Bequest,
Surprises Alumni

Furnishing Costs Delay Action
As Association Investigates
Possible Uses ol Home

No plans have yet been formulat-
ed as to the use of the Farrell Man-
sion, newest addition to the State
College buildings. Mrs. Bertha Brim-
mer, Secretary of the New York State
College for Teachers Benevolent
Association. to which the building
was deeded, revealed that an inten-
sive investigation is being made of
the uses to which the building may
be put.

Chief stumbling block in the way
of using the building is the almost
prohibitive cost of financing and
furnishing the immense structure.
Building gift of Mrs. Farrell

The building is the gift to the
Alumni Association Of Mrs. Maf-
garet Brady Farrell. It stands on
the corner of Thurlow Terrace and
Western Avenue. directly opposite
the college buildings.

One of Albany's most luxurious
private residences, the building was
given to the college by Mrs. Farrell
a month before college opened. The
gift was a complete surprise to the
college and Alumni Association au-
thorities.

Consideration was given the sug-
gestion that the mansion be used a.
a women’s residence house, but the
gift was made too late to be put to
this use. Housing arrangements for
most of the women were virtually
complete at the time of the trans-
fer of possession of the building.
Student Union Proposed

Also under discussion has been
the idea of making a student union
of the building. The lack of funds
which could be used for this pur-
pose has temporarily eliminated this
possibility.

 

 

For the present, the house will
remain unused, attended only by a

 

caretaker.

Except for rugs, the house is com-
pletely unfurnished. The purchase
of furniture contributes another
barrier to any use of the house.

The house, which was put in per—
fect condition by Mrs. Farrell be-

 

fore the bequest. is surrounded by
extensive grounds and gardens. As-
sessed at $102,000. it was built about
1904.

Student Tax Sales
' w  .
Recent: New High
The 1941—1322 salewo—i'Istudeilt tax
tickets has completely surpassed the

sales of former years, Dr. Edward,

L. Cooper. F‘uculty Advisor to the
Student Board of Finance, reported.
Ov--r 500 tickets were sold after
the firs! day of upper-class registra»
tion. At the last accounting, this
number exceeded 825.

Purchase of tax tickets is com-
pulsory in order to receive credit

 

for the school year, thus continuing
the system began last year. The
College budget is based on the com-
plete payment of the student tax,
and without a 100% return on tick-
ets the budget can not be maintain—

ed. Last year’s budget cut was thellm' Warren L- DOUSHIOI‘C as Super-

result of faulty tax collection.

To insure against a later budget;

cut, the amount of available capl-
tal must be determined at the be-
ginning of the year. No half—tax
tickets will be sold in order to ac-
compiisl) this aim.

Decision of Board of Visitors
At lnlorrnal June Meeting
Is 'Keep Status Ouo'

Special to the State College News

At its last meeting, the Board of
Visitors decided to consider the
presidency of the New York State
College for Teachers a closed mat-
ter. As a result Dr. John M. Sayles
may be considered the President of
State College until further notice.

This was released by Judge New-
ton B. Vanderzee, chairman of the
[Board of Visitors. Mr. Vanderzee
Isaid: “Dr. Sayles is as much presi-
dent of State College as he will ever
be." He stated that Dr. Sayles was
to enjoy all the privileges of the
presidency and that the Board of
Visitors would consider no one else
for the time being.
Board Holds Meeting

The Board of Visitors whose pur-
pose is to nominate and recom-
mend to the Board of Regents a
man for the position of president of
the college met at an informal
meeting in June. At this meeting
nothing was done to find a perma-
nent candidate for the position which
Dr. Sayles had been holding since
the death on August 23, 1939 of Dr.
Abram R. Brubaeher. The matter
was considered closed and Dr. Say-
les has been advised to stop mis-
naming himself as acting-president.

SChOOl- Ml‘- BOYCheff Comes to Board Approves Until July, 1940

In September, 1939, Dr. Sayles
who formerly had been director of
training and principal of Milne
high school, was chosen by the
Board of Regents to serve as presi-
dent until July 1, 1940, at which
time a permanent president was to
be named by the Board of Visitors.

In October 1940, it was learned
from Mr. Vanderzee that the se-
lection of a new president must
await legislative action and had to
wait to be introduced at the 1941
session. At a joint meeting between
the Board of Visitors and the Board
of Regents it was decided to await
legislative action.
