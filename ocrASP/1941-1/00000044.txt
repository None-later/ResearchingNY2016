Spaniard
by
C . T. M .

 

First off, we want to extend a
warm handful of digits to welcome
the fresh into sports life at State.
Congratulations and good luck to
our future standard bearers in the
sports parades to come.

We feel sure that each and every
newcomer who enters into this field
will uphold State’s fine record of
clean play and honest effort.

A quick glance over the ranks of
the ’45 lads reveals that their group
is somewhat depleted. In contrast
with entering classes of around 116
males in the past, we find that there
are but a scant 61 passing under
state's porticos.

How this will affect the sports
situation cannot be correctly sur-
mised at present. The current pro-
gram does not necessarily have to
be curtailed if a sufficient number
show interest in what is now being
offered. With an increased athletic
staff, much more attention can now
be directed to improving the major
sports. Since the quality of State's
future sportsmen is more important
than the quantity we will withhold
our fears and look to the stars.

If men coming to State do not
find the time or have the inclina-
tion to participate in the major
sports then an increased intramural
program will result. And we have
some fine suggestions which were
handed to us along this line. Two
of the suggestions which we whole-
heartedly endorse are soccer and
golf. This department has gone to
bat for soccer in the past but golf
has not received much attention.
If the girls can do it, why can’t the
men? Prominent among the pill-
pushers at State are Coach Hatfield
and a host of undergraduates. In-
cidentally. Coach has been a South-
paw Swinger so long that his irons
click with a southern drawl!

Perhaps Intramural Council could
arrange a golf tournament which
can be played off both fail and
spring just as the tennis matches
are run right now.

Last night the members of Intra-
mural Council held a meeting and
elected officers for the coming year.
Presiding this year are Regis Ham-
mond, President; Art Flax, treasur-
er; and Gene Guarino and Bill
Marsland. co-secretarles. A tie in
the voting necessitated the unusual
phenomenon of a secretary for each
semester.

Other members of Intramural
Council are Ken Johnson, senior and
Hal Singer. junior.

Briefly, the Council is made up of
representatives from the major
sports at State and from competing
teams. A member to represent Saylcs
Hall will soon be chosen by the
present staff.

Females on Annual Hike

Explore Thatcher Parl<

About 150 freshmen women were
guests of the Women's Athletic As-
sociation at the annual Indian Lad-
der hike Wednesday. Five busloads
of girls left Draper at 3:00 P. M.
and returned to Albany with an ex-
hausted group. tired but happy
after a day of sports. -

Organized hikes acquainted the
new girls with the vast territory of
Thatcher Park. where WAA and
other college groups invariably hold
their picnics. Baseball also merit-
ed the attention of the girls. and
whetted their appetites for a sup-
per (including tuna fish sand-
wiches). prepared by Nodic Davis.

the day's activities ended with a

Eleventh Camp Meet

At this eleventh annual re-union
at Camp Albany on Lake Cossayuna,
softball proved to be but one of the
many sports which helped the frosh
to enjoy themselves and become ac-
quainted with classmates and their
seniors.

The boys took part also in foot-
ball, basketball, ping-pong, tennis,
boating. and two innovations. bad-
minton and boxing.

As per usual the weather hovered
in the frigid regions. Despite this
fact, many saw fit to partake of
numerous dousings. some even
plunged in before the early morning
ice had melted.

Unlike other years, the frosh
camp was “closed” to nocturnal
wanderings. In other words. the lads
were forbidden to duck out of camp
and rub their elbows on the old ma-
hogony. Instead, the evenings were
filled with entertainment, mostly in
the form of story-telling and skits.
Long Island Ducks

The trusting freshmen were still
overheard asking each other what
was the correct solution to the now
famous and somewhat antiquated
“Case of the Long Island Ducks.”
On Saturday night Oksala. Kunz,
Kiley. and White took top honors
(due to the fact that they were the
sole performers) with a skit rip-
pling with genuine humor entitled,
“Morning Exercise." When inter-
viewed, modest Bert Kiley admitted.
“I was terrific; Oksala was good.
too.”

Another innovation, enthusiast—
cally accepted by all the backwoods-
men, was the serving of hot coffee
and doughnuts at 10:00 o’clock eve-
nings. This was in keeping with the
“stay-at-home" policy of this year’s
frosh outing. The food was excellent
as well as plentiful. Both freshmen
and the uppers admitted that they
must have put on extra weight in
their brief exploration into the wild
unknown of the far North.

Little Rivalry

Surprisingly enough, frosh-soph
rivalry dropped lower than the 1929
stock market. This can be attributed
to the absence of the 44 lads rather
than their unwillingness to act. No
longer were the newcomers taken for
midnight rides or subjected to im-
promptu dunkings in the shivering
depths of the clear, crystal lake wa-
tors.

The checkerboards and bridge ta-
ble dominated in the late evening
activity. Gambling of any sort was
tabooed. Liquid refreshments of a
personal nature was limited to guz-
zling of Coca-colas. The zero hour
was set at 12 midnight. After twelve,
the experienced uppcrclassmcn hop-
ped in their bunks well clothed.
while the new standard bearers frost-
ed in their pajamas.

On Sunday cvoning the frosh wore
convoycd home by bus. They were
fortunate in that the weather was
idcal, if not warm. No sooner did
they establiin themselves as in-
mates of the protecting walls of

WAA Program
To Be Launched

WAA's fall season opens this week
with a full sportogram planned, ac-
cording to an announcement by Kay
Peterson, '42, president. Captains for
each sport have been chosen, but
dates and places have not been de-
cided upon yet. All details will be
posted upon the WAA bulletin
board Monday.

The season. which runs from Sep-
tember 22 to November 27, will of-
fer a variety of sports including
hockey. archery. riding, tennis, bad-
minton and swimming.

Jane Greenman. '43, and Leda
La Salle. ‘44, will share the responsi-
bility of supervising hockey. Doro-
thea Simmons and Margaret Taub,
sophomores. will take charge of ar-
chery. while June Clark does the
same for riding.

Another tennis tournament is
planned. and the participants will
be directed by Lois Hafley and Mary
Domann. All girls intending to se-
cure credit for this sport should put
some hours in at the Washington
Park courts while they are still
open.

Jean Kapha and Marilyn Gale,
sophomores. will captain the bad-
minton players. The swimming cap-
tains are still unchosen, and Miss
Peterson requests that anyone who
is interested in heading the sport

 

should get in touch with her.

 

Cross-Country Team
Seeks New Material

Those who have been greatly
concerned with the celebrated
“Case of The Four-Fingered
Glove" will find its mystery in-
significant in comparison with
that of discovering the where-
abouts of State's 1941 cross-
country squad.

With a schedule all complet-
ed and the time for practice at'
hand it was discovered that
both Captain Frank Hansen
and manager Robert Cooke are
among the missing this year.
This leaves a roster of exactly
tw0 men— Bill Miller and Ben
Reed, sophomores.

However, hope has not been
abandoned. MAA has arranged
for all men of the college who
are interested to signify their
intentions to try out by signing
up on the list outside the men’s
locker room. Hurry Up!

 

Net Tourney Arranged
For Frosh Racqueteers

Playing Ability Will Be Observed
For Possible Varsity Material

All members of the freshmen class
who are interested in playing ten-
nis on the varsity squad next spring
will have an opportunity to demon-
strate their prowess on the courts
in the near future, according to a
statement issued by Art Flax, ’43,
director of this year's tournament.

As usual, only fresh may partici-
pate in the tournament which is
being arranged. The results and
ability of the jousters will be keenly
observed by tennis-minded upper-
classmen who will be on the search
for acceptable material along the
varsity route.

A list has been placed on the
men’s bulletin board, and all in-
terested freshmen are requested to
sign up immediately. Flax plans to
start at once and take advantage
of the good weather. Last year the
fall rains came and washed away all
hopes of an extensive meeting. The
Washington Park courts are still in
the best of condition.

 

Boycheff Comes

by Gene Guarino

Milne High finally has a coach
all its own. His name is Mr. Kooman
Boycheff—handsome. athletic, and
“a regular guy." In addition, girls,
he is only twenty-six years old—and
unattached.

He was born in Toledo, Ohio, was
active in high school sports, went
to Oberlin College and earned six
letters in football. baseball, and bas-
ketball. Upon graduation in 1937 he
went to the University of Michigan
as an Instructor in Physical Edu-
cation. He also coached the teams
of the practice teaching high school
maintained by the school of educa-
tion at the university. “The high
school is very progressive and has
a fine staff,” he says.

The Women’s Athletic Association
started off with a bang over the
weekend by extending a great big
welcoming hand to the newcomers
during the annual camp weekend
at Burden Lake. Certainly, the
freshmen were pleased with their
royal reception, and Susie Wing
should be congratulated on-a grand
job as chairman of the affair. Mll-
lie Mattice, as her assistant, and
Win Jones, as the indispensible
treasurer. gave all in helping the
counsellors to show the freshmen a
good time.

An unprecedented number of 157
freshmen girls and thirty-four up-
perclass counsellors overflowed the
cabins. As usual many faculty guests
were on hand to be well-wishers,
and take it from me, the inform-
ality of camplife helps to break
down the false barriers built around
“the profs" while in the college’s
environs.

Many impressions of the week-
end remain—the warm days and
freezing night . the warmly-
bundled up frosh and foolhardy
Micky Adams . . . the hi-lite of
the freshman‘s talent show—Claire
Schwartz's superb monologue in a
Swedish dialect . . . the excellent
fashion show presented by Pat
Latimer and Armede Black . . .
the invigorating dips in Burden
Lake and the boat rides upon it
. . . the impressive candlelight ser-
vice at night and the outdoor Mass
Sunday morning (the frosh were
thoughtfully spared a memorable
but dangerous ride into town in the
back of the old truck which pro-
vided innumerable thrills in previ-
ous years) . . .

One frosh was asked if she was
having a good time. “Wonderfull”,
she exclaimed. “did I sleep last
night!!!" I guess that tells the story
in a nutshell.

The Indian Ladder hike Wednes-
day also drew a record-breaking
crowd. The WAA officers are look-
ing forward to a banner year, and

‘ if the beginning is indicative of

what is to be expected of the rest
of the year, their hopes will be real-
ized.

A few words to the freshmen wo-
men. Upon payment of your student
tax, you automatically become
members of the Women’s Athletic
Association. Take advantage of all
that it offers and participate in all
its activities. You will have fun. you
will meet your classmates and the
upperclassmcn. and you will feel
better for it. Since the year is
divided into four sport seasons, try
to take part in at least one activity
for each period. Fall season starts
Monday and offers hockey, archery,
riding. tennis, badminton, and

 

swimming. Take your choice.

STATE COLLEGE NEWS, FRIDAY, SEPTEMBER 19,1941

 

5%:
The Frolllmon Go To Camp
The Dancing Debut

 

A . T.
The Camp

One of the most cherished mem-
ories of our college life has as its
locale the Cossayuna Grill. The
principal character in it was one
of the most outstanding members
of his class. He was one of the
upperclassmen who had gathered
at Camp Albany to give us our ﬁrst
look at the collegiate life.

At the time which we have in
mind. he looked like anything but
a college man. He was standing in
a chair, dressed like a vagabond.
holding in one hand a brew which
passed as legal. To the group of
admiring freshmen who surrounded
him. he was lustily singing a song
about a well meaning young lady.
Miss Nancy Brown, who did not do
quite so well.

That, to us. has always remained
the highlight of our freshman camp.
Not that the camp did not have
other events of importance. We
remember playing poker until four
in the morning, we remember going
for an unexpected and fully clothed
swim in the lake. we remember-—
but why go on? We shall retain our
memories—memories of a camp
that is no more.

A week ago, the men of the class
of 1945 went to.Cossayuna. They
went to something different. The
camp was more sedate than those
in past years. There was no drink—
ing. no staying up late. no gam-
bling.

The boys were welcomed and ori-
entated as little gentlemen. In the
past the men of the college would
come back with a complete store
of the latest jokes. culled from the
corners of New York State. This
year the closest anyone came to
an off-colored story was when they
told the one about the Long Island
duck—and unbiased observers will
admit that that is not coming very
close at all.

Three upperciassmen covered
themselves with shame at camp.
They were the bad boys of the
entire group. In deﬁance of exist-
ing rules. they gambled. they stayed
up late. and they drank.

With bottles of Coca-Cola clutched
in their besotted hands, they stayed
up till midnight playing poker, and
using checkers as money. Then, at
12 p. m., when all decent souls were
in bed, they crept to their bunks
to toss uneasily in a conscience-
tormented sleep.

Frankly, we don't know. It may
be that the camp served its pur-
pose more adequately this year. That
point we shall not argue. The only
thing we shall do is to creep quietly
into a corner, and. all by ourselves.
silently shed a tear for the good old
days.

The Debut

Yesterday we went down to the
Commons to dance, and in doing so
we recalled the first time we had
ﬂier danced there. It was the last
uay of classes before the Christmas
vacation of our freshman year—~the
day that a very understanding
friend of ours told us we were going
to learn to dance. She was more
brave than prudent. She proved it
when she said she was going to
teach us.

She must haVc been a very good
friend for her ardor was only
dampened slightly by the ordeal
that followed.

Screwing up our courage to a
height which we had never dccmcd
ourselves capable of reaching. we
wrapped our right arm around her.
and shoved off. The spectators were
then treated to a most spectacular
demonstration.

The lesson was a long one, and
before it was over, we had stepped
on our partner’s fcct more often

and harder than they had ever been ‘

stepped on before. We knocked three
unaware couples off their feet. and
we had even run into a wall.

Taken all in all. we danced like.
a locomotive with a flat wheel com-
plex. Surprisingly, we went back not .
many days later to do it again.

Today we are happy. We have not
gotten any better. We just don't
care how much we make anyone
suffer.

Bunyan Returns

In Jones’ Poem
To Aid Defense

Paul Bunyan. legendary lumber-
jack, of folk literature, has returned
to our modern scene of action in
“Paul Bunyan is Back.” a poem
written by Louis C. Jones, Instruc-
tor in English. This poem recently
appeared in the magazine section
of the New York Times. and was
hailed throughout the country as
an outstanding example of Ameri-
can poetry and thought.

The poem illustrates Mr. Jones’
interest in folk literature. an in-
valuable source of material which
as yet has not been extensively
used. “The American people," Mr.
Jones stated. “should become aware
of the great possibilities of folk
literature, which has been growing
in increasing store for many years.

Bunyan. in this poem, is a symbol
of America’s ability to get things
done. The return of this giant of
fiction to speed defense industry
represents the potential power, ac-
tion. and drive which is ours. and
which is as tremenduous, as gigantic
as the country itself.

Mr. Jones conceived the idea for
the poem while musing about litera-
ture of the past and about present
day conditions in the world at large.
He completed the poem in approxi-
mately three hours, then showed it
to Dr. Harold W. Thompson. former
head of State‘s English Department,
who advised Mr. Jones to send it to
the New York Times. The poem was
accepted and published.

Sayles Asks Students To Check],

 

Explains Cooperation
Needed to Maintain
State's Appearance

At a cost of between four and five
thousand dollars, State College was
sent to the cleaners during the sum-
mer vacation. It took forty men to
do the job.

Last Monday. Dr. John M. Sayles
discussed changes in the Publica-
tions Office with a small group.

These changes included movement
of the partitions in order to enlarge
the offices and working places of
such activities as the Srwra Common
News and the Statesman. In other
words. the changes were effected to
provide more room to work in and
less room in which to lounge.

With these few students he con-
ducted an impromptu tour of the
school. He pointed out that the ad-
ministration has gone to consider-
able expense to redecorate and re-
ﬁnish the various rooms and floors
throughout the school, particularly
the basement of Draper. All this
has been done in an effort to curb.
and. if possible. eliminate, the mis-
use of the buildings by thoughtless
students.

Dr. Sayles stated that in the fu—
ture all such juvenile and incon-
siderate practices will have to stop.
Furthermore. he indicated that he
has put the matter into the hands
of the student body and it is now
up to them.

In conclusion. he intimated that
if there were continued violations
of the rules, he might be forced to
take drastic action in order to stop
them and punish the offenders. In
this case, he referred particularly
to the proper disposal of cigarettes.

Some of the more conspicuous of
the renovations include the sand-
ing and reﬁnishing of floors. the
painting of the Commons, the
Lounge, and the locker rooms. and
the repairing of the electrical and
heating systems. Since the sprink-
ling system has been repaired and
the lawn rcseeded. the campus will
again be available for use by the
Intro—Mural Football League.

Draft Boards to Decide
Delerment For Students

Very little is known at the present
time as to the working of the Se-
lective Service Act in relation to
State College men who are 21 years
old or over. The matter of defer-
ment for college students is wholly
in the hands of each local draft
board and depends solely upon the
condition of their respective quotas.

Many of the twenty-one-year-olds
have returned to college after hav-
ing received their questionnaires
and expect at any minute to answer
the call of Uncle Sam. Many. deem—
ing it useless to return for so short
a time, have not. returned.

Stewart Home F rom Peru —

Feels They Will Back U. S.

How would it feel to start your
school year in the middle of April
and take your ﬁnals in December?
That is the procedure followed by
our “good neighbors." the students
of Peru.

Working with a Grant-in—Aid
from the Social Science Research
Council. Dr. Watt Stewart. Pro-
fessor of History, studied the Chi-
nese Question in Peru this summer.
Dr. Stewart also took the oppor—
tunity to observe general conditions
in the country and attend the Uni—
versity of San Marcos Summer
School.

World War II receives as much
attention high in the Andes as it
does in New York or Albany; though
at present it is somewhat subordin-
ated by a recent outbreak of the
perennial boundary dispute with
Ecuador. From his own observa-
tion. Dr. Stewart believes that,
while public opinion is divided. the
governmental policy is deﬁnitely
pro-American and anti-Axis?

qr Lest some American Universities
feel a bit smug about their ivy-cov-
ered walls. Dr. Stewart points out
that San Marcos is the oldest Uni-
versity in the Western Hemisphere.
being founded in the sixteenth cen-
tury.

The opportunity of speaking on a
special broadcast. with representa-
tives of many Latin American coun-
tries, was perhaps the biggest thrill
of his stay in Lima. Besides a gra—
phic impression of the Peruvian
situation, Dr. Stewart brought back
a poncho and a large sack of books.
most of them written in Spanish.

The charming wanderer looks
very fit after his “winter” in the
Andes and announces that he is
“ready to go" at his duties as Pro-
fessor of Social Studies.

For those who seek further in-
formation about the “South Ameri-
can Way." Dr. Stewart conducts a
course in Hispanic-American history
every Monday. Wednesday and Fri-
; day at 10:10, Room 200.
