The draft is considered to be the main factor contributing to this
increase‘since many of those already in the ﬁeld were forced to leave
their positions for the army. ’ Other vacancies were created by those
who left the teaching profession for better-paying jobs in defense work.

To Enter Photo Contest

The City Club of Albany has
invited all State College students
interested in photography to
participate in the “Photograph
Albany” contest which it is
sponsoring to stimulate better
planning of the city of Albany.
Since considerable talent was
displayed in the work of those
amateur photographers whose
work was exhibited in Draper
Hall last year, it is expected
that State will be well repre-
sented in this contest.

Subject matter must have di-
rect application to city planning.
and all entries must be delivered

' (Golden, Horde Declares Scamp  ‘
NOW Open On All Frame,

 

In the fall a sophomore’s fancy
lightly turns to thoughts of rivalry.
With guerrilla warfare already rag-
ing on the campus, the keenest com-
petition in years seems a certainty.

Employing fifth column tactics,
'44 scored the first blow. Under the
impression that they Were being
"rushed," six trusting freshmen were
de-trousered.

The concentration of the Frosh
men in Sayies Hall gives the verdant
ones a unique opportunity for or-
ganization. This may prove a boom-
erang. however. since any maraud-
ing Sophs will always know where
to lay their ham-like hands on a
few freshmen. .

Rivalry was as scarce in Frosh
Camp as swizzle-sticks at a WCTU
meeting. The fact that there were
three Sophs and forty-nine frosh
may have caused the usually daunt-

  
 

 

less Sophs to be a triﬂe cautious.
Everything was sweetness and light
at the Burden Lake bivouac.galso.

Gordon Baskin of Albany an-
nounces that he is a life-guard and
anyone seeing any freshmen going
down for the third time in Wash-
ington Park Lake, will please phone
him immediately. Should it be a
Soph who is doing the ﬂoundering.
let nature take its course.

Though participating chieﬂy in
official events. the gentler sex plays
a major role in the traditional melee.
The ’45 females will have to be good
to overwhelm Carroll. Latimer 8:
Go.

There is at present a standing in-
vitation to the “Golden Horde" to
drop in at the Dorm. Tea and

crumpets will not be served. but a‘

warm reception is guaranteed. The
blessing of the college is on you
both. boys, go to it.

Student Group
Works to Keep
Buildings Clean

Tibbetis Requests Cooperation;
Campus Commission Makes
New College Regulations

 

 

Creation of a new Campus Com-
mission was made public this week
by Student Council with the an-
nouncement of a nine-member
group headed by Patricia Latimer.
'44.

Almost immediately after its up-
pointment. the Commission met. and
drew up the following student-ac-
tivity regulations:

1. Smokingr shall be permitted
only in the Commons and the Pub-
lications Office.

2. Cigarette butts and ashes shall
be placed only in
provided recepta-
cles.

3. Allwaste ma-
terials shall be
placed in refuse
containers.

4. All eating
shall be limited to
the Annex and
Cafeteria Areas.

5. All notes in
student mailboxes
that are not at
least 2" by 4” in
size and dated on
the outside. will
be removed.

6. All posters not. approved by
the Campus Commission before be-
ing posted will be removed.

“These measures necessitate 100%
student cooperation," said Ralph
Tibbetts. president of Student Asso-
ciation. “since penalties have no
place in an intelligent student or-
ganization."

Campus Commission is designed
to provide major impetus in the
drive to keep the College buildings
clean, and the appointment; of a
member of Student Council as the
head of this commission is an at-
tempt to centralize control and en-
force the rules. '

Members of the Commission work-
ing with Miss Latimer are: Owen
Bombard, George Kunz. Verna
Snyder, and Una Underwood, jun—
iors; and Harold Ashworth. Ger-
trude Bove. Katherine Herdman.
and Betram Kiley. sophomores.

Regents Name Stoddard
As University President

The New York State Board of
Regents has announced the se-
lection of Dr. George D. Stod-
dard. Dean of the Graduate
School of the University of
Iowa and a leading authority in
the ﬁeld of child development
as the successor to Dr. Ernest E.
Cole as State Commissioner of
Education and President of the
University of the State of New
York. Dr. Cole has been asked
to remain as Commissioner un-
til July 1, although he will reach
the statutory age limit of sev-
enty on November 18. The com-
missioner-elect. Dr. Stoddard.
is forty-four years old and is
well-known as the author of
several books and articles on
education and psychology.

Annex Prices Up
With Food Rise

 

The vastly increased cost of food
and miscellaneOUS materials was
given by Miss Laura Thompson of
the Cafeteria as the cause of the
higher prices prevailing in the Cafe-
teria and Annex.

The effect of the increase has
been chiefly felt in the Annex

where sandwiches and milk, both of
which sold last year for five cents.
are now seven cents. With the ex-
ception of a few side dishes. prices
in the Cafeteria are the same as

last year.

“Not only has the actual food
risen in price, but incidentals, such
as straws. wax paper and napkins.
have soared to what in some cases,
is double their former cost,” ex-
plained Miss Thompson. She added
that the present seven cent sand-
wich is larger than last year’s nickel
one.

Miss Thompson believes that it is
too early in the semester to gauge
accurately the effect of the new
price scale on sales in the Annex,
but that. a slight decrease in vol-
ume seems evident. If there is no
further increase in the wholesale
price of milk. a reduction from the
present cost of seven cents may be
possible.

Miss Thompson has shown her-
self umenable to the suggestion that.
a larger bottle of milk be offered.
She is willing to substitute a one-
third bottle of milk for ten cents in
place of the present seven cent half-
pint. If sufficient demand for both
sizes exists the two would be put
on sale. In terms of quarts. the
larger bottle wouch represent a
slight increase over the current
price. selling at thirty cents per
quart instead of the present twenty-
eight cents.

The vas will shortly conduct a
poll at Student Assembly to solicit
opinion on this question.

ly submitted an entry to a con-
test sponsored by Mrulcmoisollc

of the contest required con—

how to better business in de-
partmcnt stores. Ben‘s un-Scot-
tish nature prompted her to re-
ply, "Free coke bars for all pa-

contest were Irish, too. Anyway.
after she had completely given

BEATRICE A. DOV/ER:

'45 Orientation
Begins Monday

 

Representatives of Organizations
Will Explain Activities
To Freshmen Class

 

The class of 1945 will have its
first insight into the extra-curri-
cular life of State College at an
orientation meeting Monday after-
noon at 3:30 in Room 20. Speakers

representing every phase of the .

 

varied activity program of the col-
lege will be present to describe

briefly what their activity has to

offer.

The program comes as an intro-
duction to Activities Day. which is
scheduled for Saturday. October 4.
Formerly freshmen have chosen
their program solely on personal
judgment. The new two-fold plan

 

 

will afford each freshman a more
definite basis on which to make his
selection and will help to prevent
freshmen from going out for too
many activities.

Representatives to Speak

John Ralph Tibbetts. President of
Student Association, will preside at
the meeting. Representatives from
Dramatics and Arts Council. the
News. Debate Council. Pcdugognc.
Music Council. the Statesman, Stu-
dent Christian Association. Men's
and Women‘s Athletic Associations.
Newman Club. Menorah and the dc-
partmentai clubs will speak briefly
on their activity. Thus the freshmen
will know the definite organization
of each. and can sign up for the
activity in which they are really
interested.

Registration For Activities

 

 

 

On Activities Day. the class of 1945
will go to the Commons in the

Warns of Cut

 

 

 

WARNING of a budget cut was issued
by Edward L. C00per, Treasurer of Stud-
ent Board of Finance.

Junior Reception

To Honor F rosh

The Class of 1943 will extend its
first official welcome to the fresh-

 

 

 

 

 

 

man class tonight at. 8 P. M. in the
auditorium. In complete charge of
all arrangements for this annual
reception is Thomas Feeney. presi-
dent of the Junior class.

After the formal welcome to State

morning to register for extra-class college’ wmcn Wm be “tended by

work. Mary Susan Wing, '42, has
charge of signing up the freshmen
at the various tables.

In the afternoon, there will be
dancing in the Commons from 2 to
5 P. M. to music furnished by the

via system. The traditional bonfire;

will be held in the evening in the
field between Sayles and Pierce
Halls. and will feature class and oth-
er college songs. Following this. an
open house will be held from 9 P. M.
to 12 M. at Pierce Hall.

Pi Gamma Mu Plans
lndian Ladder Picnic

At its Monday meeting Pi Gamma
Mu. National Honorary Social
Science Society. discussed plans for
its fall picnic. to be held Tuesday,
October 'I. at Indian Ladder. The
picnic is open to students of all
classes and especially to those peo-
ple majoring or minoring in social
studies. Faculty guests will include
all professors of the social studies
department.

Buses are scheduled to leave the
college at 4:20 P. M. for Thatcher
Park. The picnic committee plans
refrcsiuncnts and entertainment. A
table will be set in lower Draper
Monday for the purchase of tickets.
The price is 35 cents.

June Houshaitcr, '42. President,
announced committees consisting
of the following seniors: publicity,
Bea Hirsch, chairman. Fred Ferris,
Vincent Miller. and Shirley Kyle;
refreshments. Virginia Lay. trans—
portation. Frank Evans; entertain-
ment. Marjorie Gaylord and Edwin
Holstein.

Dean N'elson Speaks Today

 

 

 

 

The main feature of today’s as-
sembly will be a speech by Dr. Mil-
ton G. Nelson. Dean of the College.
Ralph Tibbetts, President of Student
Assoeiation. will announCe the clam
marshalls for the coming year.

Tibbetts stated that a series of
interesting assemblies which will in-
clude speakers. debates. and enter-
tainments have been planned for
the future.

 

 

Feeney. there will
be an original Skit,
written, directed.
and produced by
the Juniors, under
. the chairman-

’ ship of Marion
' Adams. The exact
plot of this skit is
to remain a mys-
tery until tonight.

Following the
skit, the two clas-

’l‘holnas Feeney ses will adjourn to
the Commons to dance until 12.
Hal Singer. chairman of the
music committee. has made arrange-
ments to have Bill Grattan's or-
chestra. following the tradition
started by the Class in having an
orchestra rather than a victrola
furnish the music. The use of the
Commons rather than the gym-
nasium for dancing is an inno-
vation necessitated by the fact that
the gym floor has been refinished
this summer and it is feared that
dancing on it. might cause some
damage. Refreshments will be serv-
ed by a committee headed by Eliza-
beth Borden.

 

Annual Open House
Date Set by Sororities

 

Arrangcmcum haVc been made by
the seven State sororities for the
entertainment of the freshmen. who
may visit the houses from 7 P. M.
to 9:15 P. M. on Thursday and
from 7 P. M. to 10 P. M. on Friday

end of sorority open houses for the
freshmen women.

Alpha Epsilon Phi, Kappa Delta,
and Phi Delta will conduct open
houses on Thursday; Beta Zeta.
Gamma Kappa Phi, Chi Sigma
Theta and Psi Gamma on Friday.

After Friday's assembly. fresh-
in'..“ women will be asked to attend
a special meeting at which instruc-
tions will be given regarding the
functions.

Cited as Cause
OF Budget Cut

Full Check of All Class Lists
Planned by Finance Board,-
Grads Among Defaulters

 

 

Edward L. Cooper, Treasurer of

- the Student Board of Finance, has

stated that a cut in the college
budget may be inevitable. due
to the fact that the decreased regis-

' tration will not permit the collec-

tion of the $14,287 prescribed by
the Student Association in its
budget meeting last spring. Even a
100% return will create a shortage.
Thus far a total of only $11,704 has
been realized from the sale of 836
tickets, making the returns fall
$2.5 i short of the required amount.
Mr. Cooper said that a check of all
class lists will be made in an en-
deavor to find out why a more grati-
fying response has not. been forth-
coming. Those found at fault will be
contacted at once and corrections
made.
Tax Not Enforced

Last year's decree by Dr. John M.
Sayles to the effect that payment
of student tax would be mandatory
before any student could enter clas-
ses has evidently not been enforced.

This may be due to Dr. Nelson's
wish that no system be set up to
prevent students from entering
classes. As a result, students were
not asked to present tax tickets as
well as class cards upon reporting
for instructions.

The decrease in the registration is
also a major factor contributing to
the shortage. Such a marked fall
in enrollment was not taken into
full consideration when the Student
Association voted on its budget last
spring.

Grads Won’t Buy Tax

Mr. Cooper stated that with two
requests for refunds on tickets from
grads, no member of the graduate
class has a tax in his possession.
Great difficulty has been encount-
ered in trying to convince the grad-
uates of the advantage of the stu-
dent activity program. “If the grad-
uates could be sold on the wisdom
of a tax purchase.” Mr. Cooper ex-
plained. “it Would be a long step

 

 

 

in the right direction."

If the quota has not been reached
after a thorough check-up. all ac-
tivities will suffer a cut in their
allotment. in spite of the fact; that
the main reason for Dr. Sayles’
More-mentioned decree was to pre-
vent any such budget cuts in the
future.
