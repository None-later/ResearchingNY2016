the most vicious, cut-throated. unorganized
rushing,r in its history.

Whereas in the past each fraternity has
had six or seven social affairs at which to
meet and make friends with freshmen, this
year each fraternity has but two. Last year
all four fraternities kept about twenty-live .
dates with i'reslmlen; this year all fotir com—
bined have only eight—approximately what
one had last year. Such a cat has resulted

The Retention oi Ration

A. T.

The editorial page Of the STATE COLLEGE News last
week carried two communications. One of them, the
second. is worthy Of comment-
Signed “A Woman." it consisted of an exhortation
to state men to form on the campus an ROTC unit.
In part it read as follows:
“Most colleges have already 'gone OVEI‘ the WT
in preparing their male population to meet that in-
evitable dragon. war. The establishment of an ROTC
here at State would not be a difficult procedure—in
fact the government is very willing to help things
along . . . Certainly state men have an obliga-
tion to the United States to aid as much as possible
in national defense and preparedness. And it‘s time
to start shootiil' now;"
I By itself. this letter is unimportant. The thing that
‘ makes it. of consequence is that it is a part of it grows
int; fever for war—a war hysteria.
This is not the first time that the STATE Col.i.iiiiii
News has been included in a mounting feeling for war.
“A movement was launched at a meeting attended
I by all the men of State College last Friday morning.
I which promises to bring there a permanent and recog-
iiiized tiiiiitai'y company. on the plan of these or-
ganized at various other American
