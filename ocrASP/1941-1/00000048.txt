The “T-lONE"—-Taste and Throat—is the
proving ground for cigarettes. Only your
taste and throat can decide which cigarette
tastes best to you... and how it affects your
throat. For your taste and throat are abso-
lutely individual to you. Based on the expe-
rience of millions of smokers, we believe
Camels will suit your ‘T-ZONI' to a “T.”

Prove it for yourself! '
