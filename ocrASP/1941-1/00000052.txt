in Canada’s

I ,Youth -
 ‘ Keeps- Fit

in a world whose heart beats to the

rhythm of marching feet and whose

I pulse vibrates with the throb of bomb-
ers’ motors, there is no quality so
prixed as youth. Youth’s enthusiasm,
its energy, its abounding idealism and
incorruptible pride are ﬂung out like
banners in a weary civilization.

Canada today is thankful for the
Pro-Rec 'plan, a movement which was
started back in i934 in Vancouver,
3. C. It is a government-conducted
scheme of tree recreation centers
which'pravide physical recreation for
youths at both sexes. Utilizing school
auditoriums, gymnasiums, church and
community halls all activities are de-
signed to develop strength, ﬂexibility
and muscular coordination. Weekly
programs of the centers read like
those of expensive clubs. Activities
have widened to include public dra-
matic and orchestral .groups, hiking
clubs, gymnastic demonstrations and
competitions, concerts, social mixers
and even radio broadcasts on sport
and recreation. And it is all free. The
only required qualifications are friend-
liness and a desire to keep fit.

Passow To Retire as Director;
Describes Bureau's Growth
Since its Start in 1939

 

 

Part Time Employment Bureau
inaugurated a new system of man-
agement to replace the directorship
of retiring head, A. Harry Passow.
who had charge of the bureau dur-
ing 1940-1941. Sara Tod DeLaney,
Dean of Women, stated that the
change in the administration will
bring into operation a board of
four members sharing equal re-
sponsibility in running the agency
instead of having a single man in
charge.

Three men and one woman will
have complete charge cf the bu-

 

reau's policies. Their names will be
announced in th: near future by
Miss DeLaney. ,

The Board will work out plans for
the bureau at future meetings. The
men will do the canvassing work.

up jobs, while the woman will

success of the system. students are

Perritz First Director-

Passow. retiring head. told about
the growth of the organization from‘
its initiation in 1939 by Edgar Per-
retz. ‘40, who took the agency
from former Dean of Women, Missl
Marciand. Later. Mary Jane Mac—
Namara assumed the title of co-
directcr and Fassow came in as
field director, contacting employers
and building up a reputation for
the bureau. While there was a de-
crease in the cooperation evident in
the first year. the bureau had an
easier time in carrying out its pro-[
gram. ,

500 Leads Last Year

Five hundred loads were listed
last year. and 250 students were
placed. While no intensive drive
has been started this year. many
students have bet-n placed. New
forms have been added and the‘
bureau hopes to extend its influ—
ence through greater efficiency and
systematic planning.

Passow feels that the PTEB fills
a long-wanted need at State Col-
logo in that an organized program
provides a more effective way to
aid students than merely individual
canvassing. He also stated that his
position as Director has afforded
him with a great deal of experience
in dealing with individuals and in
selling personalities.

Pedagogue Signs
Photo Contract

Individual, Group Photographs
For '42 Yearbook Assigned
To Gustave Lorey Studio

The 1942 Pcdagogue board has an-
nounced that it has contracted with
the Gustave Lorey Studio to take
individqu and group photographs
for the yearbook. Last year there
was considerable satisfaction with
the individual pictures. In choosing
a photographer, the board took this
as its first consideration.

Forum to Probe

NYA Reduction

The cut in the amount of NYA
money which was feared coming late
last year has been made. The NYA
appropriation to State College has
been cut by $5,000.

This means, of course, that many
of the new applications for NYA
work must be rejected and the re-
issuing of former jobs must be care-
fully considered. Miss Sara T. De-
Laney, Dean of Students, who is
also Director of NYA, is now busily
engaged in sorting the applications
and interviewing the applicants.
The Forum. newly formed organ-
ization taking the place of former
years’ Forum if Politics, is conduct-
ing an investigation as to the rea-
sons for the cut in the NYA appro—
priation. The appropriations of sur-
rounding schools and colleges are to
be investigated and a report is to
be made.

On Tuesday. September 30, at
3:30 P. M. in the Lounge, the Forum
will hold its first meeting. To this
meeting Miss Broderick. District
head of NYA. will send two NYA
representatives. A panel discussion

 

 

six poscs instead of the usual four..

The studio is extending special stu-
dent rates and freshmen and inde—
pendents arc urged to take advan-

‘tagc of this opportunity.

Each underclassman will be
charged a sitting fee of $1.50. Sen-
iors must pay $2.50. which will en-
title them to twelve pictures for the
employment bureau. To avoid con-
fusion and to facilitate better pic-
tures. students are requested to
sign up for a sitting on the sche-
dules posted on the main bulletin
board. The photographer will be at
the. college in the room noted on
the schedules from 9 A. M. un-
til 4230 P. M. every school day
from September 30 through Octo-
ber 17. after which (late no indi-
vidual pictures will be taken. Stu-
dents are requested to make their
appointments as early during this
period as possible.

Another innovation is the uni-
formity of costume. Girls are asked
to wear white or light colored silk
blouses with convertible necklines.
and preferably with long sleeves.
Mon should wear suits. preferably
dark, with white shirts.

Deane canal *
Plans Program

A new experiment in debating will
be featured this year when Debate
Council launches its intramural pro-
gram at State College.

Any school organization may
challenge another under the revised
intramural set-up. This removes
the restriction made by Ira Hit-sh,
’41, President of Debate Council. last
June to the effect that only organi-
zations having at least two members
on Varsity Debate Squad could de-
bate.

Any campus organization can
challenge any other even though
they are not in the same sphere: a
publication can challenge a fratern-
ity, an honorary society can chal-
lenge a departmental club, etc.

The Intramural schedule has
nothing to do with either the var-
sity or the freshmen debate squads.
They are only under the same
governing right. Each intramural
team can choose its own subject,
provided that it is passed upon by
Debate Council. The Council also
reserves the right to disqualify any
debater.

The intramural debates will be
held on every other Thursday after-
noon at 3:30 P. M.
