Looking To The Future

October 4, 1916 found a war-torn Europe
entering a third year of struggle with a mili-
tant Germany triumphant on all ﬁghting
fronts attempting to strike a ﬁnal blow which
would end the conﬁagration Victoriously. That
date found a nervous, uneasy United States
preparing to select a president, maneuvering
to keep itself out of armed conﬂict, attempt-
ing to enlarge its armed forces, and slowly
converting its peacetime industry into war-
time readiness.

On October 4, 1916 appeared Volume 1,
Number 1 of the NEWS. The newspaper
came to a student body whose membership
was decreasing as its members dropped out
to enter industry and the armed forces. It
came to a student population whose interests
ﬂuctuated between classwork and war news.
The paper was read by a State College stu-
dent body which looked to the future with
uncertainty.

Under such conditions was the NEWS born
and under such conditions does the NEWS
celebrate its silver anniversary tomorrow——
exactly twenty-ﬁve years after the appear-
ance of the ﬁrst issue. Once again we ﬁnd a

enrollment, and distressed by a war—torn
Europe.

Surprisingly enough, the comparison be-
tween the student body of twenty-five years
ago and today does not stop with the preva-
lent l’ramc of mind. During those war years
of struggle and uncertainty, State College
history shows that students made the great-
est gains and progress in the evolution of
student organizations. The student associa—
tion developed into one of the most liberal
organizations of its type, Myskania was or—
ganized, the NEWS became one of the few
college newspapers granted freedom from
faculty censorship of material published, and
numerous other organizations were founded
to fulfill needs of a leading teachers" college.

The growth of the NEWS itself is indica~
tivc of the trend through those years. It
weathered the storm of (101:)1'cssion years,
expanded during boom times, tidcd ovcr cri-
ticisms from numerous sources and raised
itself to the position of leader in student
activity, moldcr of student opinion, pacer of
student progress, champion for student saus-
cs, historian of State College. it has been in-
strumental in creating a better impression
of the college amongst the general public.

State College’s student body stands again
in the midst of uncertainty and opportunity.
It must distinguish between privileges and
rights and must accept the responsibilities oi’
each. Like the NEWS, the student body is
celebrating another birthday but has not as
yet attained its full maturity. A Student
Union, a College Quadrangle, a college ath-
letic field, education for the care of present
facilities, reorganization of present activities
and procedures,~the future possibilities are
limitless. Much is yet to be done!

The Learned Daughter
 A. T. ' '

In the second term of Franklin, the king of the land.
a father sent one of his daughters in search of the
Higher Education.

And he took her to his bosom and he spake thus unto
her: My daughter. thou hast reached the time when
thou must leave the home of thy fathers.

Thou leavest that then might enrich thy mind: go
thou, and sit at the feet of thy teachers to hear their
words; nor waste thy time in frivolous pursuits.

And so it came to pass that she left the house of her
father and the side of her mother: and she traveled
far and long: and she came unto the Institution of
Higher Knowledge.

She spake unto the students that had been there
before her, and she said: I am come to sit at the feet
of those who teach; lead me among them for I am
eager to start.

And they said: Come with us; we shall lead you.

And she went among them; but they took her not
unto the feet of the teachers and the dispensers of
wisdom, but they brought her first to learn of the
Social Life: and she was dismayed.

Thou shalt not divert me from my true purpose, she
spake unto them; and she left the livers of the Social
ife. ,

Now it was the custom in those days for the neo—
phytes of learning to attach themselves unto one of
the many tribes of Hellenes who made their homes
there; and so that each might attach himself to the
right group, the members of the tribes made mighty
and unceasing eﬂorts.

And this newly-arrived daughter was possessed of
both beauty and a capacity for knowledge; and the
daughters of the Hellenes gathered around her in
mighty numbers, and each of them spake unto her,

 

 

‘ saying:

Entreat me not to leave thee. for whither thou goest.
I shall go; and thy friends shall be my friends; and
my tribe shall be thy tribe; and no rival tribe shall
part us, even unto death.

But the daughter listened not unto them, but she
rose saying: I look for the dispensers of wisdom; en-
treat me not to stay with thee, nor follow after me;

And so saying. she left to seek the feet of the dis-
pensers of wisdom.

Now it came to pass that the young men of the
land heard of her plenteous beauty: and they came
in numbers as multitudinous as the creatures of the
air and the land and the sea; and they spake unto
her, saying; thy wish shall be our command. and thy
desire our task; give us but thy presence and thy smile.

But she frowned upon them and she said: Begone.
for I seek the teachers that I may listen to them: I
see that there is no wisdom to be found here; for
here there is nought but pleasure.

And the young men went away in droves; and they
wrote her down in their books as a drip.

And. unhindered, she went down unto the dispensers
of wisdom. and she sat at their feet.

And four springs followed each other; and at the
end of that time, the gowned graybeards came to her
and spake, saying: Upon receipt of ﬁve talents. we
will deliver unto you a parchment testifying that you
have assimilated all the knowledge which hath been
afforded you.

And she paid the five talents: and she took the
parchment; and bearing it in her hand, she traveled
the road to the home of her fathers’ fathers.

And her father spake unto her, saying:

Tell me, my daughter, what hast thou learned?

And the daughter began lengthin and accurately to
recount the many things which had entered into her
mind; but they fell upon the cars of her father and
filled them with boredom.

And the father listened long; and then his patience
overcame him; and he spake unto her, saying:

My daughter, these things are to be found in any
book; What hast thou learned that is not on the
printed page?

And the daughter was silent.

And a great grief fell on the old man; and wailing.
he beat his head upon the walls. crying:

Oh unfortunate man. thou hast erred: thou hast
made thy daughter a parrot; you, know thee that now
she is not a woman, for she has neither the grace nor
the charm nor the talents nor the wiles of a woman;
she hath but the words of a book.

And he wniicd disconsolatcly; but his daughter saw
him not. for she was busying herself" reciting the things
she had learned that they might be fresh in her mind.
and not fade away from disuse.

Moral: More is learned out of books than from them.
