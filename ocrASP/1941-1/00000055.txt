Lookrng To The Future
October :1, 1916 found a war-torn l'lurope
entering a third year of struggle with a mill-
tant Germany triumphant on all fighting
 fronts attempting to strike a final blow which

  

woukl end the conilagration Victoriously. That
i date found a nervous. uneasy United States
preparing to select a president, maneuvering
to keep itself" out of armed conilict. attempt-
ing to enlarge its armed forces, and slowly
converting its peacetime industry into war-
time readiness.

On October -1, 1916 appeared Volume I,
Number I of the NEWS. The newspaper
'ame, to a student body whose membership
\'as decreasing as its members dropped out
to enter industry and the armed forces. It
came to a student population whose interests
iluctuated between classwork and war news.
The paper was read by a State (‘ollege stu-
dent body which looked to the future with
uncertainty.

['ndcr such conditions was the NEWS born
and under such conditions does the NEWS
celebrate its silver anniversary tomorrows
exactly twenty-five years after the appear-
ance of the ilrst issue. Once again we iind a
student body war conscious. decreasing in

What do you know about the fa-
culty? Yes. yes. they‘re the people
who stand behind the big desks in
the front of the class-rooms. btit
it's a safe bet you don‘t really know
much about them. This column will
try and remedy that situation, as
far as it is able. For this week. we‘ll
concentrate on Professor Lang, new
Iiicinber of the English Department.

l’rofcssor Varley Lung has conic

instructor at John Hopkins. He he-
came a professor through the pro-
cess of elimination, since he first
started as an engineer.

l‘llli'opc.

Surprisingly enough, the comparison bc-
tween the studcnt body of twenty—ﬁve years
ago and today docs iioi stop with file prcva-
lent frame of mind. lluring those war years
of struggle and uncertainty, Hiale t‘olicge
history shows that siiidciits Iiiadc the great—
est gains and progress in the evolution of
student organizations. 'l‘hc student associa-

organizations of its type, .\lyskania was or-

numerous other organizations were founded

The growth of the NICWS itself is indica-
li\c oi' the trend through those years. it
weathered the storm of dcprcssion years,
expanded during boom times. tided over cri-

in the midst of uncertainty and opportunity.

[into second gear. By Thanksgiving,
things ought to be fairly under mo-I

getting down to brass tacks, By New
Year‘s they‘ll be turning over new
leaves. and during the last few
weeks of January we may even see
a bit of siooging.

The Learned Daughter
A. T.

In the second term of Franklin. the king of the land.

a father sent one of his daughters in search of the
I Higher Education.
‘ And he took her to his bosom and he spake thus unto
'her: My daughter. ihoii hast reached the time when
‘ thou must leave the home of thy iathers.

’I‘hou lcavest that thou might cnrich thy mind: go
thou. and sit at the feel of thy teachers to hear their
words: nor waste thy lime in frivolous pursuits.

And so it came to pass that she left the house of her
father and the side of her mother: and she traveled
far and long: and she came unto the Institution of
Higher Knowledge.

She spake unto the students that had been there
before her. and she said: I am come to sit at the feel

‘of those who teach: laid the among them for I am
‘ 'ager to start,

And they said: Come with us: we shall lead you.

Arid she went among them; but they took her not
unto the feet of the teachers atid the dispensers of
wisdom. but they brought her first to learn of the
Social Life: and she was dismayed.

Thou shalt Iiot divcri me from my true purpose, she
spake unto them. and she left the livers of the Social
Life.

Now it was ilic custom in those days for the neo-
1pliytes of learning to attach themselves unto one of
the many tribes oi Hellcncs who Inadc their homes
there; and so that each Iniglil attach himself to the
right group. the members of the tribes made mighty
and unceasing efforts.

And this newly—arrived daughter was possessed of
both beauty and a capacity for knowledge: and the
daughters oi ilic Hellencs gathered around her in
mighty numbers. and each of tlierii spake unto her,
saying:

Entrcal inc Iiot to leave ilicc. for whither thou goest.
I shall go: and thy friends shall be my friends: and
my tribe shall be thy tribe: and no rival tribe shall
part us. even Iinto death.

But the daughter listened not unto them. but she
‘ rose saying: I look for the dispensers of wisdom: cn—
treat Inc not to stay with thee. nor follow after me:

And so saying. she left to seek the feet of the dis-
pensers of wisdom.

Now it :ame to pass that. the young men of the
land heard of her plenteous beauty: and they came
in numbers as niultitudinous as the creatures of the

 

! sci/mm .-

fair and the land and the sea; and they spake unto
i her. saying; thy wish shall be otir command. and thy

dcsirc our task: givc Iis but thy presence and thy smile.

But she frowiicd upon them and she said: Bcgonc.
for I seek the teachers that I may listen to them: I
see that there is no wisdom to be found here: for
here there is nought but pleasure.

And the young men went away in droves: and they
wrote her down in ilicir books as a drip.

And. unlimdcrcd. she went down unto the dispensers
of wisdom, and she sat at their feet.

And tour springs iolloived each other: and at the
end of that time. the gowiicd graybeards came to her
and spake. saying: Upon receipt of live talents. we
will deliver iiiilo you a parchment testifying that you
have assimilated :ill the knowledge which liath been
afforded you.

And she paid ilic iivc talents: and she took the
parclunciii: Iiiid hearing ii in her hand. she traveled
the road to the home of hcr i'alhcrs‘ fathers.

.-\iid her iailicr spake unto her, saying:

'l‘cll me my daughicr. what liasi thou lcuriicd'.l

:\n(l Ilic daughter began lcngihily and accurately to
recount ilic many things which had entered into her
mind; but Ilicy fell upon the cars oi hcr father and
iillcd iliciii with borcdom.

And the iatlicr lislciicd long: and then his patience
ovcrcaiuc llllll, and he spake uiilo her. saying:

My daughter. these things arc to be found in any
book. what liiisl ilioii learned that Is Iioi oii llic
