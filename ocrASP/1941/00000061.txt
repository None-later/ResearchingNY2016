BIIIIIIII
 [The

Purpose: “To publicize the athle-
tics and athletes of the New York
State College for Teachers.”

With the penning of these exalt-
ed words, Bill Ryan, ’39, standing
before a small group of men meet-
ing in Room 100 Draper formed the
Men‘s Athletic Association Press
Bureau. It was indeed a much-
needed organization, for many na-
tive Albanians have confessed that
in past years they were not even
aware of the existence of State.

Organizations of this kind are
to be found in all the major col-
leges of the country. In contrast
with the altruistic services of our

 

athletic press bureau, those public- A

izing sports in other colleges are
well-rewarded financially for their
efforts.

Since that afternoon in the fall
of ’38, MAA Press Bureau has paid
rich dividends for the small amount
allotted to it by the student associa-
tion.

It contacts home-town newspapers
of the men participating in sports
and endeavors to get beneficial
write-ups for those who will soon
be seeking teaching positions. It
takes care of placing posters in ad-
vantageous spots so that all in the
college may not mISs games; it
sends to different colleges for in-
formation about athletes who will
compete with State, thus providing
a valuable source of information for
the News sports department; it
contacts capitol district newspapers
and garners every available inch of
their sports pages for State publici-
ty: and lastly, it gathers informa-
tion about State paricipants and
sends it to all the colleges on the
various sports schedules.

Those who attended the first
meeting were: Gadlin Bodner, ’41;
Joe Schwartz, '41; Jim Maloney, ’41;
Louis Greenspan, ’41; Phil Kauf-
man, ’42; Carl Mitchell, ’42; and
Howard Anderson, ’42.

The Directors during the past few
years have been, Bill Ryan, Jim
Maloney, Joe Schwartz, and the
present sports editor.

Bill Ryan is now head of the Com-
meroe Department at Sag Harbor,
L. I.

MAA is very much interested in
including a golf team in the sports
curriculum of the college. In order
to make such an add'tion, it is nec-
essary that an immediate survey be
made of all available material.

In March 1921, the GAA constitu-
tion was revised and article one
changed the name to WAA. How-
ever, this nevcr became effective,
and the organization continued as
GAA.

February 1023, saw the advent of
girls' intercollegiate basketball. Our
girls traveled to Russell Sage and
beat them 45-32. The next year. we
won again from Russell Sage by
one point—~29-28. In 1926, the score,
after a very good game. was 42—39—
that time in Russell Sage's favor.

In 1924, GAA inaugerated a sys-
tem of awards and gave to the girls
letters for three years of hard-work.
The Awards Banquet that year was
served by the freshmen in the

their twenty—fifth anniversary with
a big banquet. That same month
(1AA grew up and began calling it-
scif WAA. They also took over part
of Miss Johnston’s office for head-
quarters and began having regular
meetings and keeping files.

Since 1938, WAA has inaugurated
many new sports, especially winter
once and has set up a program
to include the whole college. Now
playdays with nearby colleges have
replaced Intercollegiate basketball
games. and an annual barn dance
with MAA has been established. We

Has Short Reign

Conscientious Undergraduates
Organize Present MAA,-
G. Amyoi First Head

A football schedule, com' ‘ - and
waiting for the play-offs IL. 1
football squad to fulﬁll the oblig
tion!

Such was the situation in SDOII:
at State way back around October,
1916. Fortunately, as the ancient
article said, “Manager Hohaus is a
good diplomat, for none but a diplo-
mat could have secured games from
colleges without having a team to
back him!"

Men‘s sports at that time were
under the jurisdiction of an unoffi-
cial “Men's A. A.”. whose member-
ship included every man of the
college.

First Football Game

The ﬁrst football in the history of
the college took place this same year
between the upperclassmen and the
frosh, the former romped over the
latter, 20-0. However, this should
not be confused with intercollegiate

football at State. That came later.

In October of the year when the
United States entered the First
World War, the governing body of
athletic activity for the men of the
college was composed of three up-
per class representatives and five
faculty advisors.

The sentiment towards football
was hopefully expressed six years
previous by these prophetic words.
“Football will have to ﬁrst creep,
then stand. then walk, and some
day it may run." However football
was destined for a short “run.”

The football squad lasted for only
three years. During this interim
State put on an impressive but los-
ing display against the Union Frosh
featured by an 85-yard run for the
locals. In 1924 State trounced the
"USS Destroyer Breck," their only
victory in sixteen starts. Topping
off the schedule in big-time football
were tilts with the Colgate and
Manhattan frosh.

The Dark Ages

After this period of energetic
planning, the sports train seems to
have passed through a long, dark
tunnel. Nothing of major impor-
tance occurred for many years and
it seemed as if men’s sports fell
into a very insigniﬁcant position.

However, in 1934 the resurrection
occurred in the sports ﬁeld. In this
year a group of clean-minded, un-
biased undergraduates got their
heads togcthcr and planned a new
experiment. These men, all prom-
inent alumni today were: Al Ja-
dick, ’36: Tom Barrington, '37; John

» O‘Bryun. ’38: John Ryan, ’36: Jerry

Amyot, ’36; and Paul Bulgcr, '36.

This group took their plan to
Dl'. Donna] V. Smith. who gave his
instant approval, and took the re—
sponsibillty of faculty advisor.

The plan called for the forma-
tion of an organization which would
preside over men's sports and bring
them within reach of every man of
the college Formerly, II group
known as the State College Trouba-
dors. unofficially took charge of the
sports and social life of the college.
Most of the organizers of the new
plan were members of the Trouba-
dors.

Experiment First

The first year the new orgunlml-
tion was culled "The IntI'Iunurnl
Council." This was III 1934-35, with
Al Judick heading It as Manager.

In 1935—30 the new constitution
was presented to the student asso-
ciution by Paul Bulger and was
approved. In this your, Gerald
Amyot, now head coach at Collocs
High School, was elected the first
president of the Men's Athletic As-
sociation of State College. The con-
stitution which those men drew up
has had little material change since
its inception.

The only original members of the
group who founded MAA. and now
on State faculty are Paul Bulger
and Dr, Donnai V. Smith. Smith's
Interest in sports is still evident in
his attendance at basketball games.
Bulger was a prominent member of

ment he had made bets with

Etudent Rivalry
Evolves Council

Reading through the old News
files one cannot help but be im-
pressed by the (“last reluctance of
the student body to change the old
order of things. Slow but sure, that's
State College, and that was the
case with MAA Intramural Council.

Impromptu athletic contests were
the style until Al Jadick, '35, started
an inter-class basketball league in
March of 1935. Under Jadlck's lead-
ership an inter-class track meet
was held in the spring—the first
such meet in ten years.

Tom Barrington, ’37, was chosen
manager of intramural sports for
1935-36. Student Association passed
a budget which raised the appro-
priation for intramural sports from
$75 to $250 proving that the under-
graduates were finally waking up
to sports in State. Activities includ—
ed inter-class football, basketball,
and baseball. Swimming, bowling,
volley ball, and tennis filled out the
program. A second inter-class track
meet was held in the spring of '36.

Snowball-like, intramural sports
gained momentum. Ed Hulihan, ‘37,
took over the helm and introduced
innovations, including soccer. The
spring softball league was really two
leagues, the usual inter-class affair
and a new schedule in which KDR,
College House, and Potter Club par-
ticipated. Incidentally the student
body voted $400 for school sports for
that year.

MAA finally came into existence
and with it an Intramural Council
in 1937 of which Pat Miranda, ’38,
was appointed chairman. The bas-
ketball league that winter consist—
cd of ten teams representing group
houses and commuters—a vital step
in intramural sports. A bowling
league was started with seventy-
five men taking part. In the spring
two softball leagues were organized
—inter—class and group house. As a
result 70% of the men at State en-
gaged in sports that year. Finally
in 1938-39 intramural sports came
around to the state in which we
find them today.

Dear Nora and Everybody,

It more than surprised me to hear
that a young female had entered
the men’s intramural tennis tourna-
ment. It hurt my pride mostly, I
guess; it would seem that the wo-
men's tennis tournament hadn‘t
been given enough publicity. Then
again it would seem, Nora, that you
thought the women's tournament
Would be too much of a snap for
you and you wanted stronger comp-
etition.

But, Nora, your action brings up
a question. Last week your unprece-
dented step was the subject of com-
ment in the men’s sports column
and in a feature article writcn by
one of the men spurts writers—both
of which were unprecedented also.
Does this foreshadow a consolida-
tion of MAA and WAA? Does it
mean a co-ed athletic program?

If it does, it wouldn't be the first
time. During a talk with Miss Min-
nie Scotland of the Biology depart-
ment and an alumna of State, I
learned .a little about the time when
the men and women played hand-
ln-hand.

However, despite the fact that
men were outnumbered more than
ten to one, their activities ate a
bigger hoﬁje in the Association’s]
budget. (They had budget trouble
even in those days.)

Well, in the Fall of 1911 the wo-
men decided to become independent
and form their own organization.
In this way they hoped to be able
to get a little more money for
themselves. Thus started Girls' Ath-
letic Association or Women's Ath-
letic Association, as it is now
known. Miss Scotland, who was
captain of basketball, was one of
the founder and held “some major
office." Further investigation re-
vealed she was president.

The girls had to pay a fee of
twenty-five cents to gain membcr-
ship, instead of becoming members
automatically upon payment of a
student tax as we do today. They
wore small round silver pins with
“AA” on it to designate their mem-
bership. 'l‘hosc also were the days
when the unappealing black cotton
stockings, voluminous bloomers, and
middy blouses constituted the gym
costumes.

We have come a long way from
the times and activities of yester-
year. With the freedom of the mo-
dern gym outfit has come greater
freedom in choice and number of
sports. But. Nora, even thirty years
ago, tennis was one of the big fea-
tures of the women‘s program.

Love,

And It Still Goes

—Tll¢ First Editorial from the First Sm: COLLEGE News——

The committee on publishing a weekly newspaper respectfully
submits to you this, the first issue of the S'rIvre CoLLeoe News, open-
ing thus, we believe. a new chapter in the history of State College.
To the many who have been entirely unaware of the coming of this
journal and to those who do not clearly understand its mission we
direct this message.

This great United States of ours was once a small nation. With
a steadily increasing population the boundaries of civilization were
gradually extended. until at last the Republic reached from ocean
to ocean. But the growth of the nation presented a possible danger,
a danger that was threatening the very life of our contryw—thc
danger of a crumbling nationalism, the danger of a growing section-
alism,thc danger, therefore. of a country divided, of a nation falling
apart.

Then, almost at the crisis, in the march of progress came in—
fluences that revolutionized the whole political and economic status
of the Republic. The rolls of the railroads and the wires of the
telegraph and telephone were stretched across the fields. the hills.
and the rivers of the land. from the East to the West, from the
North to the South. These bands of metal bound together the
extremes of the country, one with the other, making the betro-
geneity, into which the nation had grown, a solid unit. These
modern agencies of communication brought the millions of our
country into direct touch with one another—made the whole nation
a single political and industrial family.

This great State College of ours was once a small College. With
a steadily increasing number of students, courses and activities were
gradually extended, until today the boundaries of the student-life
inclosc stretches from the Chemistry Club to the Promethean
Literary society, from the athletic field to the auditorium, from the
library to the gymnasium. from the senior to the freshman and so
on, from one extreme to the other, touching upon scores of indepen-
dent groups, each with :1 different interest and none visibly con-
nected with another. The close observer must discover now the
presence of that same threatening danger in our student—life which
history shows to have once existed In the United States-ma decided
trend toward scetionnlism and away from centralization. We have
by no means reached u crisis, but there is a great need for some
means by which there can be brought to bear upon our student body
a similar influence to that which is being exerted upon the nation
by the railroads, the telegraph and the telephone. There has
arisen a need for a means of bringing each extreme of our student
life into direct touch with the other, of making this hetrogeneity
into which we have grown a solid unit, a single collegiate family.
What better means than a newspaper, such as the STATE COLLEGE
News to achieve the desired results?

In it will be pictured with insistent regularity and in installments
quickly following one another, the history of each unit of our college
life. In its columns you will feel the pulse beat of the student body.
It will be as a mirror standing at an angle into which a body peering
will not see his own, but rather the image of another.

Thus do we launch this journal on its course, with every confidence
that It fills I1 long felt want and that its policy:

To make each faction of our student organization know and appre—
clntc all others, to uphold the maintenance of fraternal regard
and friendly rivalry among all, to work for cooperation between
all sections and for the solidification of the now separately wasted
energies in the promotion of a real, distinct, and enthusiastic spirit
of loyalty to State College, will in time do much toward placing the
record of our achievements outside of the classroom on a plane in
keeping with our standing us America‘s leading teachers college.

(Signed) The Committee ol the Class of 1918, on Publishing a

Charter Stall A :7
Member Tells
Story of NEWS

“The present members of the staff
of the Sims COLLEGE News‘have it
pretty easy compared to the way the
members of the first staff had it.”
These were the words spoken at an
interview with Mrs. Amos Prescott,
175 Whitehall Road, Albany. Mrs.
Prescott is the former Lillian Magil-
ton, ’18, staff member of the first
News.

The idea of a State College news-
paper was born on Moving-Up Day,
May 4, 1916. At this time, in their
class stunt, the class of 1918 pre-
sented an allegorical charade called
“A Student’s Dream.” Written by
Alfred Dedicke, ’18, the play expres-
sed the idea that the perfect ven-
ture would be the creation of a col-
lege newspaper. Dr. Abram Bru-
bacher, then President of the col-
lege, was very much impressed with
the skit and called Dedicke the next
day. Dr. Brubacher said that he had
also considered the creation of a
newspaper and that he was willing
to help Dedicke undertake it.

At that time there was no student
tax, and the main problem facing
the students was a financial one.
Dedicke, together with Miss Magil-
ton, found that the cost of one is-
sue would be approximately $38.

At a class meeting on June 2,
which Dr. Brubacher attended, a
committee was appointed with De-
dicke as chairman for the purpose
of issuing a newspaper.

The name STATE COLLEGE News
was chosen principally because of its
briefness, and the first issue ap-
peared on Friday, October 4, 1916.

The venture was financed with
the sale of subscriptions which sold
for $1.50 a year. Advertisements
were not solicited for the first few
issues. Dr. Harry W. Hastings was
of great assistance from the start
as an advisor; and instead of the
large, spacious office which the
News now occupies, the small room
beneath the steps in Draper (now
