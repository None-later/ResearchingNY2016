Orlglnol Buildings Include /
Draper, Hugtcd, Howley;
Others Additions Since '27

In 1916 they had a State College,
but they didn't have Page or Rich-
ardson or Milne, SOT then consist-
ed only of Draper which housed the
administration offices, the library,
and classrooms; Hosted, the science
building; and Hawley, the auditor-
ium and gymnasium. The college
enrollment grew and by 1916, the
auditorium was crammed every
week~there was no library for
"studying"——a schedule of empty
classrooms was published and stu-
dents spent their free periods in
one of these.

Extensive Planning in 1919

In 1919 the planning of three new
buildings began. They stood com-
pleted in 1927, A faculty committeeI
suggested naming the new science;
and home economics hall. Rich-l
ardson, the practice school, Milne:
and the auditorium with gymnasium
beneath Page. In 1929. the ﬁrst classl
day program was held in Page Hall.
Hawley, transformed beyond recog-
nition. became the library to which
Draper’s books were moved in 1933.

In the meantime. with unrelat-
ed group houses springing up. agi-
tation for centralized housing units
arose. In 1934, the actual construc-
tion of Pierce Hall began. Called
the Alumni Residence Hall or just
the “dorm.” it was completed Sep-
tember. 1935. although the Ingle
Room was not finished until later.

Sayles "all Completed

A year ago last spring, the alumni
property between Ontario and Par-
tridge Streets again became the
scene of activity—this time in be-
half of State's manhood. Now, Say-
les Hall. the first men’s dormitory.
and almost the replica of the we-
men’s dormitory, is a finished pro-
ject, accommodating 134 men.

Mrs. Farrell’s bequest of her
$100,000 mansion across from the
college campus is the latest addition
to Alumni Association property. The
possibilities of using the mansion
for a Student Union are now being
investigated.

Future Service Destiny

 

 

First Mysl<ania
Of Humble Birth

It was Just another student as-
sembly. A few people were listening
to Dr. Brubachcr. but for the most
part it was a disinterested audience.
Students were whispering. doing
homework, thinking about the com-
ing week-end. Then Professor Waik-
er rose and walked solemnly across
the platform. There was a momen-
tary hush as he slowly called out
the names: Kolin l-lagcr, Mildred
Lawerence, Edith Wallace, ctc. . .
Thus was the first Myskaniu arr-
nounced.

 

 

 

From Small Beginnings

Who would think now that the
dignified and majestic Myskania
had such humble beginnings? Today
the tapping of Myskanht is the most
important part of the Moving-Up
Day program.

There was no pomp or ceremony
when the first Myskania was an—
nounced. There was no excitement
or eager expectation on the part
of the student body on that day in
April. 1017. Miss Wallace. who
teaches in State Collcgr: today. was
a member of the first Myskanla,
and she wasn't even thch when the
names were unnormccd. No one
realized what a mmnoi'nblc day it
was. No one lili't'hitw whut an im-
portant part Mysknrrin Wits to play
in the future life of State College.
Second Tapping Cruel

Shades of Captain Kiddl The tap-
ping of the second Myskunin was al-
most cruel. While a pianist played
vigorous music, tho vntim Junior
clues marched run-oat Lln- surge. and
as they passed by, tho out-going
Myskunia pulled out of lino those
chosen to be on tho iii-(coming My-
sknnia. (llnllglln' ilro feelings of tho
Juniors who Irud expected in be
tapped on Hwy llllil'tflli'fl back to
their seats.) That was adding irr-
Jury to insult. This next your the
present method was inaugurated.

The early Myskrtniu wore chosen
by the faculty and out-going MY-
skunia. Since 1920. however. the fa-
culty has had no voice in choosing
members. The student body elects
three members, the rest being chos-v

 

on by tho out-going council.

Fraternity and Sorority

Rules Undergo

Extensive Change After Councils Appear

‘KDR, Poiier Originate

Inter-fraternity in 1936

Picture State College where, at
the beginning of the year, a popu-
lar freshman strolling by a group of
"aternity men causes no excite-
ment. A few casual greetings are
made. no more.

That was twenty-1'ch years ago
when only one fraternity. Kappa
Delta Rho. was in existence. There
was no rival fraternity to compete
for the Fresh and consequently, lit-
tle or no rushing was done.

....
...

Second Fraternity Founded

Things changed in 1930 when Ecl-
ward Eldred Potter Club was
founded. Rushing was taken more
seriously and the iii-coming students
found themselves drafted into one
fraternity or the other. Thus. in
1936. it became necessary for the
two fraternities to meet and form
an Interfratcrnity Council which
would keep all rushing clean.

In the spring of 1938. Kappa Beta
was admitted as the third member
of the council and in the fall of that
year. Sigma Lambda Sigma was ac-
cepted as the fourth.

Interfratcrrrlty Council consists
of representatives, two seniors and
one Junior from each fraternity.
The four offices of the Council ro-
tate among the four fraternities.

Rushing Rules Changed

Only a few changes have been
made in the original rushing rules.
The tired freshman can no longer
sleep in a fraternity bed for a
night. it was decided. Bctwccn two
and seven in the morning. the fresh-
men are not allowed in the fra-
ternity houses. The Council also
supervises the time when bids are
to be given and returned.

The fosteriqu of social and athle-
tic activities in order to promote
good feeling among the fraternities
has also been a major purpose of
the council.

“Dear Editor:

gratulntlons to the State Col-
lege News, this time on its silver
anniversary. I can do no better

Once before, Dr. Hurry W.
llustings, Professor of English,
has had occasion to extend it
congratulatory message to the
S'rA'rn Cottaon ans. This oc-
curred when the ann was a
more infant of ten.

 

 

 

Sorority Rushing System
Reorganized by Council

 

“Everybody was so nice to me at,l
first. but oh mamma. I wanna;
come home now.“ the freshman girll
sobbcd after a hectic six weeks at:
State. That was back in the years
before Intcrsority Council. l

Freshman Mobbcd :
A Freshman was mobbed from all“
sides if she had any talent or beauty. ‘
She had no private life until tlrcl
final day of reckoning came when,
she made her (ICCISILH under high—l
pressure. After that (lay, her
"friends" disappeared one by one
and only her sorority sisters were
left to console her.

Dean Anna E. Pierce was among.
the first to understand the plight
of the Frosh. Intersorority Coun-
cil was established. The following
year it published its first rushing
rules. No rushing of any type
could be carried on until second
semester with the exception of the
first ten days of school.

Eligibility List

The second rule was not quite as,
drastic, but it managed to cause‘
quite a commotion at State. One D
was enough to keep any girl off the
list of cligiblcs that was submitted
by the faculty.

Intersorority ’I‘ca was later ill-l
stitutcd. In November the girls metl

drank tea. ate cookies and parth
with headaches and sore feet. Al-
though not much was accomplished,
it was an annual event until rc-
placcd by Open House two years
ago.

Result of Evolutionary Process

ILionl and 'Echo' Joined-
To Produce 'Siaiesman'

Though the S'rivrn Cottaun News“
has retained the name it was givenI
at its founding. the Statesman is
the result of an evolutionary pro-
cess. The title and character of the.
magazine have changed considerably:
since 1892. ‘

The Slit/(H‘HHHH evolved from a
combination literary magazine and
college newspaper founded in 1892
called the Normal College Echo. .

From this magazine grew the‘
S'r‘A'rn Cottr-zcu ans, the Echo, the
Pcdugogrrc. and the Lion.

When the News came into exis-
tence in 1916. the news department
was abandoned and the Echo spe-
cialized more in stories. essays.
plays. and poems. Although renamed
the College Qllfll‘lf'l'lll in 19i8, the:
old title was resumed in 1929.

In 1926. another magazine, the
Lion. appeared at Christmas time.
Both of these magazines flourished
until May, 1939. when the student
body voted to combine the two to,
form one magazine, the Stalcsnrml.
The boards of both magazines, con—
solidated into one unit. announced
that the Slrrtcsmmr would feature
commentaries. editorials, stories.
articles. poems, and humor.

The first issue of the Sldlcsrmtu
with Harriet Sprague and Marcia
Brown as co-editors, appeared dur-
ing Thanksgiving week. 1931. Mil-
dred Kirschenblum. 1940 editor.
campaigned for improved covers. For
this year, the Statesman has Mary
Klein as its editor.

Alumni Praise NEWS Record

“The alumni are always with
us." Yes, it's true; even with
the passing of a quarter of a
century by the Nrrws. the grad-
uates remember. Their con-
gratulations are expressed by
Mrs. Bertha E. Brimmer, Ex-
ecutive Secretary of the Alumni
Association:

"Many alumni associations
have publicity departments.
The S'rA'rrr Cottnua News has
filled that need for our alumni
association. For its splendid
cooperation both for news items
and educational items we are
very appreciative. We wish
for the Nlclvs another twenty-
five years of growth and pros-
perity."

'Pedagogue' Predecessor
OI NEWS by 16 Years

The Pcdrtgoguc proceeded the

 

 

ans by 16 years .but its progress
has been less continuous. becaust
after the first book in 1900, publica-’
tion was discontinued for severall
years. It wasn’t until 1912 that thel
numc Paddy/(mun was applied. l

The Podugoguc‘s predecessor. the
Ncon, was published in 1900 with
William Ranney, ‘00, as editor-in-
chief. Dedicated to Dr. William
James Milne. then president of the
college, the Nmm was on cntcrpris~
ing little book including pictures of
the faculty. seniors. classes, and fra-
ternities. a literary section, and an
activities section.

Brit thc Noon failed financially.
and no other class attempted a

written material with few pictures.
Since then the book has been pub-
lished regularly.

The newly-named Pcdur/omu' of
1912 was a photographic issue. The
1918 book contained an honor roll——
happily discontinued since then!
One year later the annual was dedi-
cated to Theodore Roosevelt. 1922
found the Pod campaigning for a
State College dormitory.

Student Tax Included ‘l’cd‘

Up until 1939. the Pcthlgogm' was
procured by individual orders plac-
ed in the fall. That year the student
tax was increased to $12 per stu—
dent including $1 assessment for
the Pod.

The 1940 yearbook bade farewell
to formality with an innovation in
the line of informal pictures, Last
year's Pcddgoyim staff produced a
book "as sophisticated as possi-
ble." Senior write-ups, reduced to
bare essentials, produced quite a
contrast to those of 1914. The Pr'drr—

size and volume. but in skill. in

’25 YW‘Y°U"9’~NF"°" Numerous Administrators Reign

The twinkle in Dean Milton
G. Nelson’s blue eyes is clearly
apparent in his letter compli-
menting the STATE COLLEGE News
on its twenty-fifth birthday:

“I am happy to have this op-
portunity to congratulate the
STATE COLLEGE News on the
occasion of its being twenty-five
years young.

“For twenty-five years the
STATE COLLEGE News has made
student opinion vocal. and has
played its part in directing the
college student body toward
group accomplishment through
deeds and not through words
alone; in truth, the STATE Col.-
LEGE News is not so much a col-
lege newspaper as it is the Col-
lege itself. May the next twen-
ty-five years be ever younger
in spirit and even more success—
ful in leading the student body
to high accomplishments."

l During the twenty—five years of
the News‘ existence there have been
many changes in the administration
lof State College. In 1916. the first
‘ycar of the publication of the News,
Dr. Abram R. Brubachcr was presi-
dent, Dr. Harlan Horner, Dean, and
;Miss Anna E. Pierce, Dean of Wo-
.’rnen.

One of the most loved of all fig-
ures that have been in the college
was Dr. Brubacher. Always work-
ing for the good of State College
and its students, perhaps his big-
‘gcst contribution was getting State
transformed from a normal to a lib-
{eral arts college. Without him.
[there would never haVe been a
:Men’s Athletic Association. Under
him. the Richardson. Page, and
TMilne buildings were added to the
lcollege.

Until the time when he left to
become Associate Commissioner of
Education. Dr. Horncr acted as
'Dcan. He was more than well lik-
.cd by the students. who were in-
stantly put at ease by his winning
personality and ready sense of
‘of humor. With Dr. Brubacher. he
userved on the board of directors
lthat added the new buildings.

Miss Pierce probably did more to-
ward the improvement of student
housing conditions than anyone
connected with State. She was the
instigator of the housing inspection
plan. Her favorite belief was co-
,operative housing. She and Mr.
Hidley. of the social studies de-
partment, started College House, a

 

Futtercr Inaugurator

Of D 8: A Society

The opportunity for State College
students to see the best in enter-
tainment did not always exist. for
twenty years ago, outside of occas-
ional plays presented by various
dramatic groups. there was no spe-
cial organization designed for spon-
soring this form of creative ability.

A newcomer to the State Faculty
in 1920, Miss Agnes Futterer corr-
ceivcd the idea for a dramatic and
arts society. formed from a collabor-
ation of dramatic groups and art
students. the former to perform in
the plays, the latter to aid in stage-
craft.

The first plays presented were
amazingly successful and from the
second play a profit of $300 was re-
ceived.

herself ran a group house for wo-
men.

Succeeding MISS Pierce at the
post of Dean of Women was Miss
Helen Hall Moreland. who also de-
voted herself unselfishly to the bet-
terment of housing conditions for
students. She continued and im-
proved the co-operative houses
started by MiSS Pierce. She was
interested in all student affairs, and
spent a large part of her time with
students in their own homes. A
tall, statuesque person, always per-
fectly groomed. it Was her personal
appearanCe that always impressed
a student on first meeting her.

Dr. Metzler was the successor to
Dr. Horner as Dean. Fundamentally
a scholar, he did a great deal in
raising the scholastic standing of
State.

The present administrative staff
is headed by Dr. John M. Sayles,
acting president, noted for his long-
range building program. Miss Sara
T. DeLaney. Dean of Women, is the
motivating force behind the reform
in the college social program. Dr.
Milton G. Nelson, perhaps the clos-
est friend of all the students, is
Dean of Students.
