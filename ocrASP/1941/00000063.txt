Myskania Helps
In Constructing
Discussion Plan

Students, Faculty to Cooperate
For Considering Questions

About Student Affairs

Unprecedented action was taken
by Myskania. senior leadership so-
ciety, in a meeting with Dr. John M.
Sayles, President of the College,
Last Tuesday. when the body and
the administration pledged "all-out"
cooperation in settlement of prob—
lems of student affairs, and took
steps toward setting up a mechani-
cal means for such cooperation.

The new program provides for a
discussion committee composed of
twenty-one student leaders and
from six to ten faculty and admin-
istration members. This group in—
cludes the President of the College
and the Dean of Women. Dr. Say-
les has offered to chairman the dis-
cussions if the committee feels that
his services will be required.
Source of Information

According to Myskania, the pur-

pose of the move is to create an
information source upon which to

rely for constructive actions tend-
ing toward a better student-faculty
relationship.

The committee will have no pow-
er of action, merely that of recom-
mendation.

This singular step has not been
made with the idea of increasing
the participation of the faculty in
matters of student government. It
is an action initiated by the stu-
dents, for the students. for the bet-
terment of their college life. and

the welfare of State as a whole.i

Myskania declared.
Members of Committee

The committee in the proposed
program will be composed of the

editors of all publications. the presi-3

dents of the four classes, the vice-
presidents of the freshman and
sophomore classes. and the heads of
all other major organizations. In
addition to Dr. Sayles and Dean
DeLaney, six to ten faculty mem-
bers invited by Myskania will coin-
prise the discussion committee.
Aside from the fact that the pro-
posed program is unprecedented in
the history of the college, this also
marks the first time that Myskania

has disclosed any action taken in

its private meetings.

ALBANY, NEW YORK, FRIDAY, OCTOBER 10,1941

Possible Expulsion May
Confront Tax Defaullers

“The situation arising from
the low sale of student tax
tickets remains the same,“ Ed-
ward L. Cooper, faculty advisor
to the Student Board of Finance.
stated this week. There will be
a further waiting period during
which students who have not
purchased their tickets may do
so before any out or other such
move will be made.

A list of non-payees has been
turned over to the Dean of Wo—
men‘s office. A possibility that
these students may be dropped
from college is being considered.

 

Forum to Direct
Absentee Voting

Ferris Initiates Plan to Allow
Easier Voting by Students;
Must Apply in Draper

 

The Forum of Politics is sponsor.
in; a system whereby students eli-
gible to vote but residing avin from
home may procure absentee ballots
at the college for the state elections,
Tuesday. November 4.

Due to the inability of most stu-
dents to go home November 4. Fred-
erick Ferris. '42, speaker of the
Forum, consulted with the Albany
County Board of Elections in order
to institute a more convenient sys-
tem of absentee voting for college
students. The procedure to be tried
this year is the result.

Students residing in towns with a
population less than 5,000 are not
required to i'cg'istei‘ personally at
their local boards. However. they
must secure an affidavit of absen-
tee voting and apply for a ballot
before October 18 at the table which
will be in the lower corridor of
Draper. These applications must
then be mailed to the students” 10-
cal boards of elections.

ThOse students who live in towns
with populations above 5.000 01' '

 

,ciiies other than New York City
must rcgistcr in person at thcii'
,‘IOCilI boards of' elections, October
,10. 11. 17. or 18. They must also
1havc obtained an affidavit of ab-
sentee voting mid filled out an ap-
plication for it ballot at the talch
,in Draper by October 18. The table
,will be Iip from 9 A.M. to 3:30

Finance Revision
Assembly Topic

As a result of a recommendation
by Myskania. Student Council will
introduce in today's assembly a
resolution for an appropriation to
pay for the services of an auditor
who will periodically examine the
books of all Student Association or-
ganizations. This resoluton was pre-
ceded by a suggestion from My-
skania that Student Board of Fin-
ance determine the possibilities of
setting up a uniform system of
bookkeeping for all organizations.

A Myskania spokesman explained
that the proposed plan to stand-
ardize the bookkeeping system has
for its purpose the ellinination of
budget padding. The system will al-
so stop the "prevalent practice of
keeping records on scraps of paper
or of not keeping records at all."
This lack of competence has pre-
vented Finance Board from accur-
ately tabulating expenditures and
losses. A standard system will keep
a check on the ﬁnances of every
organization; in addition the audit
will provide a basis f'or the determ-
ing 01' all future budgets.

Another resolution will be intro-
duced in today's assembly by Mil-
dred Mattice, '43. Secretary of Mn-
sic Council. The resolution is: Re—
solved: That a committee of three
members, one from the Sophomore,
Junior and Senior classes, acting
until they graduate. be appointed by
Student Council to set up an or-
chestra agency whose duties shall
be to: (ll get the orchestras for all
class dances and (2) to act in an
advisory capacity for all other
school organizations.

StateElTo Hear
Famed Pianists
In Duo Concert

Fray, Braggiotti Will Render
Novel Type of Concert,
Duo Pianist Pioneers

Music Council will present the
world-famed piano duo, Jaques Fray
and Mario Braggiotti in the coun-
cil's initial concert on Wednesday
at 8:30 P.M. in the auditorium of
Albany High School. They bring
to State College students a new
type of program, ranging from the
classics of Bach to the more mod—
ern melodies of George Gershwin.

Fray and Braggiotti have per-
formed before crowned heads in
Europe, winning international fame
by their nimble fingers. The duo
was formed in Paris eleven years ago
at the French Conservatory, where
the two artists merged their talent
and pioneered in the field of duo-
pianism.

Ability Widely Acclaimed

Their debut at the Salle Plevel in
Paris in 1928 showed the many pos-
sibilities open to twenty talented
fingers working in unison. They in-
troduced humor to the concert stage
in 1930 when they rocked the au-
dience at Carnegie Hall in New
York City with take-offs on famous
composers using Yankee Doodle as
the principal theme.

Newspaper critics are unanimous
in their praise of the two. Jeanette
Ryerson, '42, President of Music
Council, said: "I think we're pretty
lucky. having a chance to hear two
such good performers. Their pro-
gram..has lots of appeal for every-
body—from lovers of the classics to
jitterbugs and swing fans. Why,
cvcn Joe Levin—athletic. mascu-
line Joe—says he can't wait for the
fifteenth to roll 'round—(he heard
them last year here in Albany) and
Perlman will give you the opinion
of the other group. Anyway. see
Joe and Bernie for incentive, then
come yourself and see why they're
so enthusiastic!"

’l‘ax Holders Admitted Free

Holders of student tax tickets
may see the concert free of charge.
General admission to others is sev-
enty-five cents. with reserved seats
selling for $1.10.

General chairman of the concert
is Jeanette Ryerson. and assisting
her are: George Kunz. '43. Max
Reeves, Bernard Pcrlman and Al—
berta Lee. seniors, publicity; Ira
Hirsch, '42, and Jean MacAllister,

De Laney Form Leller Causes
Error in Porenl Understanding

By Andrew 'l‘iikas

Recipients of disturbed letters
fi'om their parents at home, State
College wonicii this week found the
reason in a misiindcrsianding of i1
i'oriii letter sent to the homes 01' all
the women of the college by the
Dean of' Womcn, Sara Tod DcLaiiey.

On September 29, Dean DcLiiney
released (1. letter explaining that
written permission from home was
rcqiiircd every time that Ii college
woman desired to spend a night or
11 Weekend away from her official
residence.

In part, the Dean's lcttcr road:

"Women students who do not Ich
with their parents or other members
of their family must secure permis-
sion from their Head Resident or
House Mother for all overnight ub-
scnccs . . . It is necessary that
these persons know that the absence
meets with the approval of the
student‘s parents and such approval
should be sent in writing directly to
the person in charge of the house
where your daughter is living.

" For all overnight visits to
men’s colleges or to the homes of
men students. or for trips on which
the student will stay in a hotel, it

I

 

will be necessary to have a state-
ment from you covering that partl-
Cllllll' absence."

Misintcrprcting the letter as a
personal warning of the misbehav-
ior of their daughter. many parents
immediately sent letters to Albany
inquiring as w the meaning of the
Dean’s message.

One freshman rcccivod it note from
her mother saying,

"I have always trusted you dur—
liig your high school years, and now
you are on your own. Can't you take
care of yourself. Are you going
astray?"

The personal interpretation ap—
plied by inuny purcnis to the form
letter is clearly brought out by this
letter from the father of a senior:

"Sara ’1‘. DeLaney, Dean of Wo-
men. sent us Ii letter referring to
overnight absence at college. Why
is the Dean writing to us about your
staying overnight? We don’t know
why she had any reason to call our

. attention to this matter. We and

you know that you aren't. supposed
to stay out late or to stay overnight
at any time or place.

“Please let us know at once."
