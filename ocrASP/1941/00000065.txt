STATE COLLEGE NEWS, FRIDAY, OCTOBER 10,1941

 

GINNY

This year’s Frosh are going to
see another innovation instituted in
this here ole college of ours. The
mimeographed handbook of WAA
is no more. In its place we are go-
ing to receive a printed handbook
which is going to cover all four
seasons in one edition. (This solves
all that consternation of last spring
about the appropriation to WAA for
its handbooks.)

Anita Holm, editor, has planned
an unusual booklet which is going
to surpass any previously put out.
For the first time in ten years pages
will be set up by professional type-
setters. Not only that, but this
year’s book will serve the Frosh for
the rest of their stay at State. It
will cover WAA in general instead
of just the seasonal sports. It will
present the Association’s constitu—
tion, the requirements for credit
in each sports and for annual
awards, and messages from faculty
members and WAA songs.

But besides all this, the handbook
will include a new feature. The last
four pages will be left blank for
the girls to keep a record of their
participation in sports. These re-
cords, stamped by the respective
sport captains, will serve as a double
check for ascertaining the individ-
uals credit. There will also be a
chart for the girls to keep track of
their weight and height changes
throughout their college careers.
(Girls, it's going to be hard to hide
that increased avoirdupois with a
record of it, isn’t it?)

This year copies will be printed
for the upperclass women as well
as the Fresh, so look in your mail—
boxes for them at the end of next
week, girls.

Kay Peterson declares that the
annual Fall Banquet of WAA is to
take place in the cafeteria Thurs—
day. October 23. The films from
Miss Johnston's camera are going
to be the main portion of the enter-
tainment. These will include pic—
tures of State girls on the field of
sports, movies made by Miss John-
ston out West, and some colored
stills.

Keep that date open,
evening of October 23rd.

Remember that MAN from RPI
that I told you about last week.
Well, it seems that thirty girls went
to meet him, for that‘s the number
of l‘cmmes who signed up for fenc-

But the serious business of fenc-
ing (the main attraction, you know.)
is scheduled for Saturday morning,
from ten to eleven, sturting Octo-
her 18th. Equipment will be pro-
vided by WAA.

Another sport in which it great
amount of interest was shown is
basketball. Don‘t forget, girls, that
this is a rivalry sport. That means
the Fresh and Sophs should get in
good condition.

Flo Garfall defeated M. Schlott
in the second round of the WAA
tennis tournament to the tune of
6—1, 6-2, and thereby became the
only entrant awaiting her third en-

Inclement weather has all but

Flo's success in overcoming her
opponent can be contributed to a
consistently good serve, which she,

Marian Sovik and Dotty Huyck.
Three other second rounds still
have to be played. Ann Fritz

Potter Club continued to literally
stampede the opposition this week
with decisive wins over Kappa Beta
and Sayles Hall by scores of 19-6
and 27-0. Counting Potter’s earlier
wins over SLS and KDR by 18-0 and
12-0 scores, Potters has scored a
total of 76 points in four games
while the opposition has been able
to push over only one tally. With
their three easiest games left to be
played it is the concensus that it
should not be difficult to pick the
new football champs at this point.

Potter’s ability to capitalize on
the breaks of the game has charac-
terized their every play. Intercept-
ed passes, blocked kicks, long
lightning passes have brought them
victory. Bill Dickson, Torn Feeney,

Bull Throws Man—~—
Turns Tables at Last

To Paraphrase the old pro-
verb; ‘you can lead a bull into
the stall, but you can't make
him penisivei‘.

Den Demick, '44, learned this
lesson from actual experience
this summer. Mr. Demick, an
old cowhand. was returning a
bull that he had raised from a
child, (I mean a calf) to his (the
bull‘s) stall, when his childhood
companion reared and gored
him. This was no laughing
matter to Mr. Demick, who
spent 11 days in the hospital re—
covering from this playful lab.

Mr. Demick states that in the
future he will not only be wary
of girls in red sweaters. but
never again will he be guilty of
"SITTING a BULL."

Intramural Sport Program,-
Soccer Loop Proposed

The status of the cross-country
team which for a few years had re-
mained as a question mark on State
College’s sport program was finally
decided this week by MAA council,
and now it has no status at all.
There were various reasons giv-
en for the extermination of the hill
and dalers, lthe principal one being
lack of interest both by the parti—
cipants and the student body as a
whole. The teams of previous years
had never received any spectator
support at home contests.

Attempts to organize a team this
fall failed, prompted Bill Dickson
president of MAA, to conclude,
"We feel that this is the wisest
move, since interest and activity in
a sport are the fundamental bases
for its continuance.”

This year's proposed varsity
squad was severely handicapped
when Bob Cooke, manager, and

Frank Hansen, captain, failed to re-
turn to school this fall. Moreover.
Don Demick was hurt during the
summer, leaving only two iettermen,
Bill Miller and Verne Marshall.
sophomores, to carry the burden.
Since new recruits failed to arrive,
there was little or no choice con-
cerning the cross-country situation.
The lack of a suitable training
period for the team as a whole was
probably one of the principal reas-
ons why local barriers had compil-
ed such disasterous records.

In place of cross-country are
plans to extend the intramural pro-
gram and thus affect a larger por-
tion of the student body. Golf, bowl-
ing, volley-ball, ping-pong and sec-
cer are planned. This last sport will
be introduced at State, first in in-
terclass games, and later a soccer
league may be formed.

Owen Bombard, '43, has been
elected vice-president of MAA
council, replacing the position va-
cated by Frank Hansen.

CARL

Well, the inevitable has finally
come to pass. The curfew of Ar-
mageddon has wafted over State’s
cross-country squad following the
action of the Men’s Athletic Asso-
ciation last Monday night.

We knew it was coming, yet we
shirked the thought of writing the
obituary for one of the few remain-
ing manly Sports in our college.

Perhaps some of our readers
might be interested in tracing the
beginning of the fleet-footed outfit.
Here it is:

‘Way back in the good ’ole days
of 1934, a group of level-headed lads
twho were also responsible for the
major uplifting of State sports from
obscurity) got together and decrded
to form a hill and dale outfit. These
boys Were a determined lot and
State soon boasted a very fine squad
which began to knock down victories
at the expense of spirited competi-
tion. But, these men graduated from
the old school and difficulty was
in the offing for the newcomers.
Victories were fewer and interest
slid from the band wagon.

Since 1938 the squad never on-
joyed the fruits of victory. Specta-
tors were as scarce as penguins in
Plattsburg. Thus, in 1941 AD, after
a reign of six years, the dusk fell on
State College cross-country.

To many of its founders it may
come as a distinct surprise .
they're still within earshot .. .. .. they
are Paul Bulger, Al Jadick, Cliff
Rail, and Milt Goldberger — we‘re
sorry, too.

cerns a six-foot-two lad who com-

the honorable rank of Lieutenant

it it til

Intramural Council found a very
strange problem on its hands the
other day, and seems to have dealt
with it in a very strange manner.

The perplexing situation came up
when it was discovered that the two
newest teams on the football card,
Sayles‘ Hall and II did not have
enough material to support two good
teams. So—thcy decided that the
better strategy would be to consoli-
date the two outfits and make one
concentrated efficient unit. It was
done, but what about the games
already played? How were the
standings in be revised?

The answer came at once, over—
rule all games played by the two
outfits and compute the standings
based on the other gumcs which
the teams played. But here's the
rub. all the games which the boy's
dorm hud pluycd were ruled out»
except two victories.

Well, we can't say that the C(illll-
cil neccssurlly acted unfairly. be-
cause it really Wits it unique situu—
tlon. But We have got to hand it
to the boys for clipping filings in it
fast manner!

Last week We cast a brief glance
in the direction of a new member of
the faculty—this week for contrast‘
we present a born and bred “Stat-
er,” Mrs. Egelston.

In 1926 New York State College
for Teachers granted Martha Al-t
bright a teaching certificate. She
spent two and one-half years in
“lab work" in the history depart-
ment. She did substitute teaching
in the Albany schools, and taught

 

for a half year in Callicoon, Ncw' 

York. In the following year she
came back to State as Instructor in
History, and here she has stayed,
to State's advantage.
Prefers Freshman Class

Mrs. Egelston loves State,
believes that no other college can
be compared to it. Her favorite class
is perenially the freshman class,
and she always regrets Moving-Up
Day, and the creation of a sopho-
more class. Though she declares no
other American cities equal Albany,
Mrs. Egelston has traveled over
most of the United States. and at
good part of Europe. Hcr favorith
city of Europe is Berlin—the Berlin!
of 1927. i

Mrs. Egelston admits to several
hobbies—deer hunting, tracking
down animals near her summer
camp in the Adirondacks, and read-;
ing biographies. Her four and'u
half year-old son is her favorite
hunting companion.
Animated History Lectures

So there we have a much too
brief sketch of Mrs. Egelston, whose1
lectures on Ancient and Medieval
History are among the clearest
memories of many State College
graduates. This writer recalls a
memorable talk on the conditions:
among poor children in eighteenth
century England. and another amus—
ing picture of a young man who
wore jewels and perfume. and curl-.
ed his raven locks—Julius Caesar.
And this writer also learned for:
late that Mrs. Egelston requires
much more than a surface knowl—
edge of history for a good mark in
her classes. Remember that, fresh—
men, who think that history is a
snap course like Ryan (lid. Thought

Draft Problem

Request Complete Cooperation
From Eligible Senior Mon,-
lnterviews End Today

Miss Irene Semanek, assistant
director of Student Employment
Bureau, stated this week that the
bureau's policy in regard to the
draft situation will be the same as
last year. Senior men are requested
to cooperate by keeping the bureau
posted as to recent developments.

Last year the draft problem- was
disregarded unless the candidate
knew definitely that he would have
to leave for the army at a certain
time. The bureau then permitted the
draftee to decide for himself as to
whether his name should remain on
the list of available candidates. The
same procedure will be observed this
year.

Students Urged To Register

If a candidate does not know if
his name will be called, the bureau
will recommend him anyway. Then
the matter will rest solely between

ble students are urged to register

 

now with the Student Employment
Bureau regardless of the draft prob—
lem because it is best to obtain in-
culty references while the professors
still retneinbcr the students.

"Waiting before getting these
references is unwise," Miss Semanek
said, “inasmuch as teachers' refer-
ences may be limited because they
have forgotten the students."
Visits Recommended

All Seniors are expected to come
into the office from time to time
during the year to become acquaint—
ed with Paul M. Bulger, the director.
and Miss Semanek. Mr. Bulger and
Miss Semanek will be guided in
making selections for positions if
the students have told them of their
interests, the type positions pre-
ferred. and their capabilities along
special lilies.

It is expected that interviews
will be finished on Friday, October
10. Students who were unable
to keep their previous appoint—
ments are requester! to come in Fri-
day.

Slate Acquires
Seiol Tympani
For Orchestra

Word has been received that State
College may be suspected of sabo—
tage. In the purchase of a new set
of tympani by Music Council, the
national defense mechanism has
been interrupted: the tympani con-
tains enough metal to manufacture
one good-sized machine gun.

The new tympani consists of two
parts, a high drum and a low druln.
Each drum is a hollow sphere co-
vered with calfskin. The druln with
the smaller head has the higher
notes, since the skin is stretched
tighter. The difference from a drum
is that the tympani can be tuned
to a recognizable note by stretching
the head.

On the hand tympani, the note
could only be changed by changing
the screws. On the new tympani,
the note is changed by merely rais-
ing or lowering a pedal which locks
it and doesn't allow the note to
change.

Formerly, that is before the pur-
chase, the tympani had to be bor—
rowed from Albany High School for
use in a concert.

The purchase of the new tympani
was financed by Music Council with
the money left over from last year's
appropriation since last year no
musical artist was brought to State
College for a performance, Music
Council went to Dr. John M. Say-
lcs, President of the College, and
asked blin if it was advisable to in—
vest in a new tympani. Dr. Saylcs
guided the purchase and even secur-
ed a 25‘)? reduction. The Leedy tym—
pani which sells for $340 was pur-
chased for $225. .

The new tympani is being used
jointly by the State College Sym—
phony Orchcstru and the Milne
Bond.
