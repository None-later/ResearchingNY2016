'Vogue' Otters
Career Contests

New York Positionsf'Available
To Fashion Contest Victors;
Only Seniors Eligible

There are jobs waiting in New
York City for two of our tal-
ented college seniors! Vogue mag-
azine is now sponsoring two can-
tests, one the Prix de Paris, open
to senior women; the other a
Photographic Contest, open to all
seniors.

The Prix de Paris is similar to
the Madamoiselle contest which re-
sulted in a position at Lord and
Taylor’s, New York, for Beatrice
Dower, '41. Girls with a flair for
fashion reporting may compete for
first prize, a year's job with salary
on the New York staff of Vogue. A
six months’ paid job is offered as
second prize along with five other
cash prizes and several honorable
mentions.

All winners will have the oppor-
tunity to be interviewed by organ-
izations having job openings in the
big city. The competition is based
on four quizzes and a short article.
Seniors interested in following
Dower's footsteps may write to
Carolyn Abbott,Voguc, 420 Lexing-
ton Avenue, New York, for further
details.

All seniors are eligible for the
Photographic Contest offering two
c reer prizes—one for men and the
other for women. Consisting of a
six months’ apprenticeship with
salary in the Conde Nast Studios
in New York, these prizes carry
with them the possibility of a per—
manent position if the trial period
is successfully completed! In addi-
tion, cash prizes will be awarded
for the best photographs submitted
for each of the eight problems pre-
sented in the magazine.

 

 

Dates Set for Rush Parties

Interfraternity Council has plan-
ned the dates for rush dances this
year in such a way as to prevent
them from coinciding with other
college functions and increasing
the burden of Freshman activities.
This year each fraternity will be
allowed two rush parties, but there
will be no smokers.

The dates for the affairs are:
October 24, EEP; October 25. SLS
and KB; November ’7, KDR; No—
vember 8. SLS; November 14, EEP;
November 15, KDR and KB.

State’s NYA Funds Probably
Will be Increased—Chauncey

Each of Three Frats
Gains Belated Pledge

Just to polish up their pledgln'
manners. three of State's fra-
ternities each sent a bid to a
desirable but previously-undis-
covered addition to its ranks.
Sigma Lambda Sigma lured
James McFeeley, ’44, from the
mass of independents; Potter
Club, much belated, pledged
Grant Hermans. '43; and Abba
Koblenz, ’44, received a bid from
Kappa Beta.

KB tried to break tradition
last week-end when it sought to
include a female among its
members. Miss Dorothy Brach-
man of Albany was Joined in
marriage to Bernard Bernhardt,
’44, of Kappa Beta. Undoubt-
edly, rules of the college regard-
ing women in frat houses will
part them before death does.
The married couple honey-
mooned in New York City at the
Hotel Victoria.

Com Club Seeks
Fraternity Rank”

At a meeting of the Commerce
Club yesterday afternoon, Virginia
Polheinus, ‘42, Secretary, gave a
report on information secured con-
cerning Pi Omega Pi, National
Commercial Teachers‘ Honorary
Fraternity. A discussion was hech
on the proposed application of State
to form a chapter of the fraternity
on the campus.

According to information sent to
Miss Polhemus by the National Or-
ganizer, A. E. Schneider, State is
eligible to become a chapter of Pi
Omega Pi. Because of the exist-
ence of the Commerce Club. State
would probably not have to wait
the 6-month probation period cus-
tomarily required by the organiza-
tion for neophyte chapters.

Members of Pi Omega Pi are se-
lected on a basis of scholarship, and
are required to have 10 semester
hours of commerce and 5 semester
hours of education as outlined in
the national constitution. There is
no required number of people nec-
essary for the formation of a Pi
Omega Pi chapter.

State was advised to organize its
chapter in as short a time as pos-
siblc.

College Secures
French Resident

Mlle la Feuille Becomes Head
OI House Designed to Give

Conversational Fluency

For the second time in as many
years the French Department has
been instrumental in setting up a
French House. North Hall. one of
the Alumni residence cottages, is
being used for the project, and
through 1the efforts of Miss M. An-
nette Dobbin, instructor in French,
a young French woman, Mlle Ger-
maine la Feuille, was obtained as
head resident.

Established to provide a means for
improving the speaking ability of
those living there, the house will
also give students in French classes
an opportunity to participate in
conversation groups.

French Spoken Exclusively

French is spoken exclusively, and
even the meals in the private din-
ing room of Pierce Hall are “eaten”
in the foreign language. The State
Education Department is in favor
of such group houses, and the
chance for jobs for French majors
and minors is greatly increased.
since they can compete with grad-
uates of colleges which have a simi-
lar set up.

Mlle la Feuille, head resident, was
born in the village of Guingainp,
Brittany and had her secondary
education at Bordeaux. She studied
at the Sorbonne, a division of the
University of Paris, and completed
her work for the “agregation des
lettres." The examination for this
degree is extremely difficult, and
only the most brilliant students are
admitted. The “agregation” gave
Mlle la Feuille a life position as
professor in the secondary schools of
France.

Lecturer at Vassar

Before coming to Vassar Col-
lege in 1938 as visiting lecturer
Paris.

Last year Mlle la Feuille was a
substitute instructor at Bryn Mawr.
Because of the complications in the
international situation, she must
remain in the United States. As a
head resident was needed here. and
she wanted a position which would
give her time for research and study.
she accepted the offer of the college
and the Alumni Residence Halls.
who jointly pay her salary.

Mlle 1a Feuille needed the per-
mission of the French Government
to come to the United States. and
she is still a. functionary of the
Ministry of Education.

“We know that beginning next

month there will be additional NYA
allotments,” stated Mr. Claude
Chauncey, district NYA representa-
tive in an exclusive interview with
the SrAra COLLEGE Nsws. “However,
the amount and destination of these
allotments are still undetermined".

Chauncey explained that a ques-
tionnaire had been sent to colleges
throughout the State requesting
information as to the amount of
money each college still needs or, if
the college has an allotment greater
than it needs, the release of the
excess sum for use by other col-
leges.

Mr. Chauncey said, “I happen to
know that some colleges will re-
lease funds.“ These funds will be
realloted to colleges in New York
State whose original allotments
proved insufficient. The size of
these reallotments will depend on
the amount released; the colleges
to receive additional funds are to
be determined from the answers to
the questionnaires.

After attending the Forum discus-
sions on the NYA out last Week,
Mr. Chauncey observed that the de-
mand for additional sums is great
at State. If it is greater there than
in other colleges. State will be
among the first to receive a real-
lotment of funds. From facts
brought out in the Forum meeting,
the NYA representative believes
that, if there are additional funds
available for State College. they, will
be wisely spent.

AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA

Mr. Chauncey maintained that
the Forum discussion greatly in-
fluenced the type of questions which
he included in the collegiate ques-
tionnaire. "I came back from the
meeting the other night,” he said,
“and wrote out the questionnaire
which I sent out to all colleges the
next morning. The discussions in
that meeting had a direct bearing
on the kind of questions I asked
on the blank. Although I would
have made out some kind of blank
anyway, the Forum influenced the
questions. I am very grateful for
the assistance of the Forum."

The NYA funds were originally
administered by the federal govern-
ment. The allotment granted to
each school depends upon the num-
ber of pupils enrolled the previous
November 1. Last year 9.2% of the
pupils enrolled in a school were
employed by NYA for nine months
of the year at $15 a. month. The
Appropriation Act of Congress cut
this percentage of allotment to
7.5% for all schools in 1941-42.

The proposed reallotment system
is entirely a state project. The
questionnaire made out by Mr.
Chauncey will be the basis of the
system. All reallotments will go out
from the NYA office here in Al-
bany.

The original cut in NYA funds was
due partly to the increase in pro-
duction caused by the defense pro-
gram. Outside part-time jobs have
become more numerous, thus les-
sening the need for NYA jobs.

Higher Publishing Cost
Raises Price of ’Ped’

It is estimated that the 19421’cdu-

goguc will cost anywhere from sixty
cents to one dollar plus a student
tax ticket as opposed to the fifty
cent Ped of last year. This is be-
cause of the fact that the cost of
publishing has taken a big jump
over prices of former years, due to
the increased cost of printer's ink
and paper.

'Administration Seeks
'ReasonstorDelinquency

 

According to Edward L. Coop-
er. 'I‘rcasurcr of Student Board of
Finance, 100 per cent collection of
Student Tax is anticipated within
the next few weeks. With the coni-
plete cooperation of the administra-
tion. an effort is being made to fol-
low up the reasons for the budget
deﬁcit. Before action is taken
against those students who have
failed to purchase a ticket, the ad-
ministration intends to investigate
the reasons for their delinquency.

However. Mr. Cooper explained
that even if every student does pur—
chase u Student Tax ticket, a bud-
get cut of approximately 6 per cent.
will be necessitated. The present
budget is based upon an enrollment
of 1000 students, and the total num-
ber of students now in college is less
than 1000. With the election of a
student auditor it is hoped that
budget pausing will be eliminated.
