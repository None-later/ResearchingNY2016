North Carolina's Challenge . . . .
Students Collect
88 Tons Of Scrap

Sentiment was shelved when 300 students of North
Carolina State College got behind the newspaper
scrap drive and rounded up 175,000 pounds of
metal in less than three hours. Sponsored by The
Technician in cooperation with the student council
the drive kept eight trucks busy and netted three

carloads of scrap.
Many relics dear to campus. tradition were

thrown into the heap, and the shout "got in the
scrap” became the school cheer.At the end of the
day thescrap pile included such items as a World
War I German howitzer, a football goal post and
hundreds of other items from boilers to bed springs.

And with the campaign ended North Carolina
has issued a challenge to other schools of the
nation to outdo it in collecting scrap. The student
body of 2,400 is ready to take an all-comers on
a per capita basis. They have an average of 72
pounds per student. Wottord —Acme

Encore

The Notre Dame Savoy-
ards, campus dramatic or-
ganization, presented Gil-
bert and Sullvian’s ”H.M.S. ‘
Pinafore" so well before
the school's naval trainees
that they have been called
back for an encore. This
month they are planning
to produce the G-5 mas-
terpiece "Patience", for the
group and public too.

they say:

After 2 hours and 45 minutes of work by 300 students, this scrap pile
took shape on the North Carolina campus. An inter-campus rtvttlty
was started to see which section Of the student body could collect the
most scrap metal. Now a challenge has been issued to other schools,

The favorite meeting spot Of North Carolina students is no part of the scrap drive, and the part-
ing word will be, “meet me where the cannon used to be.” The college is an ROTC school and
contributed many old field pieces to the scrap drive.

With men in the Army, Navy, Marines, and Coast Guard,
the favorite cigarette is Camel. (Based on actual sales

records in Post Exchanges and Canteens.)

Scrap collecting was facilitated by the use of "walkie-talkie“ rotti-
sets used regularly to instruct ROTC students in the Signal Corps on:
These radios went with the trucks and kept a constant communitot

with the base at the scrap pile. Assignments for the trucks were too:
on the run.

After the tile was
moved this was the re-
ward. Note the happy
faces as the huge gun
is rolled out to see serv-
ice once again . . . this
time for the other side.
The German gun
weighed a l m 0 st two
tons and required the
efforts of 40 huskios to
move it to the heap.

 
   

Here was the toughest lab at the drive. Twenty students were required to move a carload of
tile to get at an old German howitzer deep under the stadium. There was still a lot to be done
when this picture was taken.
