How an Aviation Cadet Spends His Day'

 

Every American youth wants to help his country in
its defense of its principles, and there’s something
about the Air Force that makes him wont to do his
par‘ t"M branch of the service—which is O. K.
with UnCte am who needs pilots, navigators, bam-
bardiers am men for his ever increasing ﬂeet of
war planes. .
Flocking to H is arm of the service are thousands
~of collegians. Typical of them is Cadet John |.. Har-
ris, .lr., formerly of Georgia Southwestern College,
'who exempliﬁes the high intelligence and physical
qualities of the men of the United States Air Forces.
lets’ follow him in a typical day at Napier Field, the
army’s advanced ﬂying school at Dotham, Alabama.

To get into the Army Air Force a cadet has to be

in perfect phvsical condition. Poor teeth can cause
a lot of trouble, so Harris makes a dash for his
toothbrush and a brisk morning scrubbing session.

 

With a mighty yawn and a healthy stretch, Cadet Harris
awakens to a typical day in the life of an Armv Aviation
Cadet. He sleeps well under the watchful eye of his hometown
girl-friend whose picture rests above his bed.

Not only do planes have to be refueled,
but pilots also demand a certain amount '
of fueling . . . and that steak keeps the
old motor purring for Cadet Harris.

Breakfast over, he takes his speedy plane out on the starting line
and is ready to take off into the "wide blue yonder.“ Much of
the morning will be spent in combat training. '

A sound background in the theory of modern warfare is as im-
portant as flying ability, and here Cadet Harris and his class-
mates attend a regular lecture session. Many hours are spent in
the classroom and in outside book work.

A universal custom when it gets to mid-afternoon,
Cadet Harris imbibes in a little refreshment at the
P. X. (Post Exchange to you who don’t know army
talk.)

Staying on the beam is important to a pilot,-
therefore, radio is given its share of man-
hours. Here Cadet Harris is working out a
practice message.

College Freshman at T4 — Charles McIntosh reg-
istered as a freshman at Glenville (W. Va.) State

his fourteenth birthday. He was taught by his par-
ents, both graduates of G.S.T.C., until ready for the
third grade. He then combined third and fourth to
gain a head start and wound up as valedictorian
of his high school class. Collegiate Digest Photo by Shelton
