Battle for Second Place

College House extended a helping

march by forfeiting a game to them
last Wednesday. Potter now has ﬁve
wins and no losses to its credit. A
weak Rambler team is their only ob-
stacle to an undefeated season ——
and the title.

Sayles Hall downed a ﬁghting SLS

their third win gratis by the

KDR broke into the win column
Wednesday when they tallied 15

Tennis Tourney Slowly
Nearing Completion

Hampered by inclement weather
and teachers' conventions. the
freshmen tennis tourney is slowly
nearing completion. The contestants
have already reached the mid-point.
with the ﬁnals but a few days away.

“We expect to have the l'rosh
court champ crowned in the early
part of next week," predicts Art
Flax, who is directing the most un-
usual net tournament in years.

The difference of this year’s tour-
ney from other years lies in Nora
Giavelli. the only feminine entrant
ever to take part in a man's cVent.
However. Norm Finer defeated this
pulchl‘itudinous representative of
’45, 6-3. 3-6. 6-4. “It was really a
tough match." asserts the winner.
“but I had to do something to up-
hold the honor of the men at State."

Fran Mullin is scheduled to meet
Rablncau in one of the semi-ﬁnals.
while Finer is opposed by Dick
Beach. Both Mullin and Rabineau
won their previous matches by com-
paratively easy scores of 6—0. 6-0,
and 6-0, 6—4. respectively. Thus a
close contest looms in the fore—
ground.

SIATE COLLEGE NEWS. FRIDAY, OCTOIER11,1941

 

PARI.

The greatest disaster. in our opin-
ion, to reach State within the last
few days is the news that Nora Gla-
velli dropped a hard-fought match
to Norman Finer, thus eliminating
her from further tournament com-
petition.

To those who may consider say-
ing “I told you so." we just want to
say that this is the ONLY match in
both the women’s and men’s tennis
tournament which went. three
games. The score is far from decis-
ive and we still bet our shirt that
the young lady could have come out
on top if she had taken the affair
seriously enough. Like a true sport
Miss Giavclli came through smiling
at the end of the match. We still
say, “Congrats, Nora. you did extra
well!"

Basketball

In a prevue of Coach G. Elliott
Hatﬁeld's current cage schedule, we
came across one of the toughest and
best cards ever seen in these parts.
Starting off with a long trip to
Clarkson on December 5th, the team
will encounter seine of the best com-
petition in its class. We'll release
the listing at a later date but you
can take our word on it—it's topsl

We wish we could have been
around last night to see what the

turnout was for the inital call for

basketball material.

About only ten men or so could

have shown up since many of the
former lads are very much oc~~

(-upicd at the present writing.
llarry Bora is working, Frank

Hansen is out of college, Red
Evans sustained an injured leg in
a recent intramural tilt which
will keep him out for four more
weeks, while Paul Merritt is out
permanently as far as sports in
college are concerned because of
a bad ticker. That leaves Bill

Johnson Will inaugurate
Soccer Tomorrow

 

Ken Johnson. director of intra-
mural soccer has stated that this
sport will be started at State begin-
ning tomorrow.

Original plans called for four
teams to represent the four classes.
but due to the small number of
names found on the list to date.
this may not be possible.

In the event that an insufficient
number of men signify their desire
to compete. there will be a game ar-
ranged bctwccn the lower and up-
perclassmcn with six men on each
team.

No one will be allowed to play un-
less he has been examined by Dr.
Earl J. Dorwaldt.

 

by Fred Beyer
“Campus Day gives the new fresh-
men a real opportunity to show
their full colors. Its aim is to arouse
early in the year a class spirit and
a college spirit that shall last and
grow stronger until June. Athletic
contests, competitive class stunts,
and the crowning of Campus Queen
mark the day."
The previous quote from the
freshman handbook sums up Sat-
urday’s fanacticism in a very bus-
inesslike manner. But is “business-
like” the term to link with a hectic
jamboree featuring hair-pulling fe-
male wild-cats and belligerent mas-
culine bomb-shells?
“We’ll kill the bums!” declares
Pat Carroll, President of the Soph-
omore class. But lightning and
thunder go together. Joe Tossoni.
unofficial leader of freshman rival-
ry is known to have said “We're out
for blood!"
The ball actually starts rolling
this afternoon in front of Page Hall
when mass murder in the form of a
pushball game will be committed. A
substantial squad of muscle men has
volunteered for both the trash and
the sophomores. and the stage is set
for “the greatest show on earth."

Frosh, Sophs' in High Spirits
Fer Campus Doy Rivalry Contests

 

 

However, the men of State will
shine tomorrow afternoon when a
series of soccer games will be played
on the ﬁeld between Sayles and
Pierce Halls. The Juniors will face
the Seniors, the Sophomores will
tangle with the freshmen. and, if
time permits, the play-off battle will
be fought.

State's glamour girls will let down
their hair during the day, don their
multi-colored bloomers, and add
their bit to rivalry spirit. A three-
legged race. an obstacle race, and a
hockey ball relay race will be the
battles fought by our fresh and
sophomore Amazons. Mary Do-
mann is leader of the Sophomores
while Mary Sanderson captains the
frosh. Unofficially, it is rumored
that the National Guard is to be
called in to keep order during these
contests.

Last year the arrogant frosh
humbled the Sophomores by coming
out on top at the end of rivalry.
Now. with the ﬁrst of the rivalry
points about to be captured by the
victors today and tomorrow, it would
be safer to sit on a time bomb than
to predict results. But Sunday.
when the smoke of battle is cleared
away. we can all talk over the deeds

 

of the gallant fresh and sophs.

“MY

Girls — that suppressed desire you
have always had to fence need no
longer be suppressed. Tomorrow
morning and every Saturday morn-

free fencing instruction given by a

be able to say “touchel” and “en

that. come to the Page Hall gym.
Let’s see you and your roommate
there every Sat’dy mo’ning!

The. tennis tournament is still
going strong. but is ﬁve games away
from the deciding contest. Garfall
is still waiting for Sovik and Huyck
to play their match; Domann and
Elswood are vieing for the honor of
playing Giavelli, and the winner of
the fourth round match will be the
lucky recipient of a silver cup. I’m
looking forward to seeing at least
one tennis tournament completed
before I leave college. How about
fulfilling my hopes, girls?

Thursday night W.A.A. is having
its annual Fall banquet in the cafe-

be very glad to exchange a feed
tickets for thirty-fivecoppers. Be-
sides a good dinner, movies and lots
of fun, the W.A.A. handbooks will
be ready for distribution.
