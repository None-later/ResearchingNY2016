Fewer Students Register
With Employment Bureau

 

Student Employment Bureau this
year has interviewed 258 new stu-
dents for registration as well as 6 re-
registrants. The effect of enroll-
ment decreases upon the bureau is
shown by the fact that this year's
total is 264 while last year at this
time 330 were interviewed.

Upon registration each student
pays 'a. $5.00 fee; the placement fee
is $3.00. Seniors have been informed
as to the use of this money. At a
general information meeting, Sep-
tember 25, the proposed budget for
1941-42 was approved:

Yes sir. it’s every man for him-
self—at least when it comes to pick-
ing the 1941 Campus Queen. Your
guess is as good as the next person's!
There are ﬁve smooth co-eds to
choose from—State really is co-
educational even though we doubt
it sometimes—and only Myskania
know the winner.

East and west. north and south—
the five hail from every quarter of
the state, from Long Island to the
home of R. P. I. (Troy in case you
didn’t know). Three brownettes and
two blondes comprise the quintet.
What head will receive the crown
from the dark head of Bea Dower
’41, last year’s queen?

The girls have a lot to offer, all
five of them. There's last year’s
Junior Prom Queen, in the running
for another title, WAA’s blonde
president, Music Council’s petite
head, the guiding hand of SCA and
last but not least, the President of
Residence Council. Marion Duffy,
Kay Peterson, Jeannette Ryerson.
Kathryn Wilson and Mildred
Swain. All of the girls had ardent
support from their fans. Which one
has the largest following will be
determined when the students see
who will head the royal procession
down the Page aisles.

Tomorrow night at 8 P. M. wit-
nesses the nineteenth coronation of
a Campus Queen at State. Campus
Day originated in 1921, but 1922 was
the year that saw the first queen
reigning. That year it was provided
that the students should select the
most popular girl in the senior class.
And since that day, the election of
Campus Queen has been an annual
topic of speculation and interest.
Following the usual trends, three
of the contenders for the crown are
Myskania members. Participation in
extra-curricular activities and pop—
ularity seem to be synonomous in
the minds of State College students.
Maybe it's because the girl selected
typifies State at its best.

Suspense is riding high. Cul-
mination will come tomorrow
night when the strains of “Pomp
and Circumstance" will reveal to a

 

Jack’s Hamburg Stand.

“Now listen, fellows, can’t you stop
making all that racket? People are
trying to sleep." So spoke the police.
not once, but twice, when neighbors
complained about the noise coming
from “that Grattan boy's cellar."

It is that same “Gra ttan boy” with
part of that same orchestra who
will entertain State College at the
All-State Dance next Friday night,
October 31. In three years. Bill
Grattan‘s orchestra has risen from
a group of boys playing for their
amusement to one of State College's
favorite entertainers.

Grattan is now enrolled at State
College as a member of the class of
’45. He doesn‘t have time to enjoy
any of the receptions offered to the
freshmen. since he has to play at
most of them. Dost year. while still
in high school, Grattan furnished
the music for the Soph Soiree.

This year has shown a great
change in the physical appearance
of the band. Last year at the “Swing
Concert.” Grattan used 14 men. This

year only ten men will be used.
Grattan feels that by using ten men
he can achieve the same effect of 14
and the idea is more practical com—
merclally.

In his new orchestra. the ."3x stc-
tion will be featured. The sax sec—
tion will be on the style of Jimmy
Lunceford. Grattan himself plays

first tenor sax. He plans to concen- ..

trate on swing and slow standard
numbers rather than on the popular
ballads. “Popular songs change so
fast and are generally so poorly
written and uninspirational that it
isn’t worth the time to give them
good arrangements." Grattan said.

Grattan is also scheduled to play
at the Sophomore reception tonight
Playing with Grattan tonight on
the drums will be Jim Laurie. a
student at Albany High School, who
played with Red Nichols and Claude
Thornhill.

Grattan is planning a few prize
specialties for the All-State Dance.
The dance will be held at the two
Alumni Residence Halls. with an
orchestra at each dormitory.

Faculty Attends
State Conference

State College faculty members
were well represented at the two-
day conference held by the faculties
of the two New York State Teach-
ers’ Colleges and the nine State
Normal Schools. Thirty-one mem-
bers left Sunday afternoon for Buf-
falo in a special coach assigned to
them by the New York Central Rail-
road for the round trip.

The program for the conferences
was arranged by a committee of
three of which Louis C. Jones,
Instructor of English, was a mem-
ber. The purpose of the meetings,
held for the most part in the build-
ing of the Buffalo State Teachers’
College, was to dichSS a variety of
education problems.

A former member of State's fa-
culty, Dr. Harold W. Thompson.
now associated with Cornell Unl-
vcrslty, spoke in a sectional meet-
ing held Monday afternoon on the
subject, “Techniques of Collecting
Folklore in Local Areas.”

At the banquet held Monday eve—
ning at the Hotel Statler, Dr.
Thompson again spoke, on “Riding
a Whirlwind on a Blue Ox." a topic
smacking of Paul Bunyan tales.

Delaney Speech Delve:
In Cats, Iniun: and Doors

Miss Sara T. DeLaney, Dean of
Women, spoke in assembly last
Friday, using as her theme,
“Black Cats, Dead Injuns, and
the Open-Door Policy."

“We must overcome silly sup-
erstitions,” she said. “When we
were young, we used to believe
that a black cat was bad luck
and that the best injun was a
dead injun. Now we are older
and have given up these beliefs.
Life forces you to make your
own decisions. Whatever you do
ShOWS your beliefs. Some of us
still have standards and ideals
but many of us are afraid to
acknowledge them.”

Calendar Revision

(Continued from page 1, column 5)

State College was chosen for the
Workshop because it is possible for
the Milne High School to be contin-
ued throughout at least a part of
the month of June and thereby
make available opportunities for ob-
servation and discussion of teacher
training theories and practice in
actual operation. -

The areas within which problems
for the Workshop are to be selected
for study are: growth and develop-
ment; reading. writing. and speech;
and the art of teaching.

A cooperative study of teacher
education in the associated colleges
and universities of the state. of
which the coming Workshop is an
important phase. was undertaken by
the Association when the five-year
teacher-training program was in—
stituted. A Committee on Teacher
Education, of which Dr. Sayles is a
member. was appointed. and a grant
of $45,000 was secured and made
available over a three—year period.
Last year a Workshop was held at
Syracuse University, and the prob-
lems of social understanding. the
humanities. science, and profes-
sional education were discussed. The
Committee on Teacher Education
met on October 3 and decided to
conduct a Workshop again in 1942.
A General Planning Committee was
appointed with Dr. Sayles as Chair-
man. Dr. Elizabeth H. Morris,
Professor of Education. also repre—
sents State on the Committee.

SCA to Hold

Sherwood Eddy. prominent author-
ities on international affairs, will

Wednesday at 8 PM. on “The
Present War and Our Responsibil-
ity." Social Studies students are
invited to the discussion.

One speaker will interpret the
paciﬁst point of view as regards
the world crisis, while the other

tion. After the two men have spok-
en, there will be an open discussion
of the question in which anyone in
the audience may participate.

Reverend A. H. Muste is a well-
known labor worker. Besides writing
“Non-violence in the Agressive
World,” Reverend Muste contributes

Temple at New York City.

Dr. Sherwood Eddy. noted author,
lecturer and world traveler, has
written twenty books on internation-
a1. economic, social and religious

ventionist side of the question.
