Gone With The Breeze '

 

“INNY

Tomorrow morning Leda La Salle
is taking a group of hockey stick
wielders.to Bennington College for
a conference with six other institu-
tions—which promises to give the
State. girls quite a time. Besides
State and Bennington gals, there
will be elevens from Vassar, Skid-
more, Russell Sage, University of
Vermont, and Mt. Holyoke.

For the last few weeks the State
girls have been practicing, or I
should say, playing with the Mo-
hawks. a team of women coaches
who are superb players. This inval-
uable experience ought to stand
them in good stead tomorrow in the
numerous games scheduled for the
day.

The lucky femmes planning to
leave Albany tomorrow at ten for a
day with their Vermont neighbors
are: Kit Herdman, center forward;
Marion Duffy, right inner; Dot
Townsend, right wing; Mary San-
derson, left wing; Leda La Salle,
center half; Jane Williams. left
half; Jane Greenmun, right half;
Win Jones, right fullback; Sally
Beard and Marian Soule. left full-
backs: and Ken Carey.

First Camp Weekend

The wilds of Chatham will re-
sound with the cries of the gals of
State over the weekend. In other
words, a group of hearties will take
over Camp Johnston for the first
time this season, where they will
catch up on lots of sleep in those
classy triple deck bunks. Good food
cooked in an open fireplace. long
evenings spent singing around the
same fireplace, long and short bikes
for Lotta Banker's credit, and just
plain loafing will all be included In
the program. In short, girls are
going to have an all-around. healthy,
good time from the time they jump
off the train in Chatham this after-
noon, until they sling their blanket-
rolls aboard for the return trip Sun-
day.

Fencing Successful .

Fencing started last Saturday with
an enthusiastic bunch of fifty girls
turning out to learn the art of self-
defense. Clinton Mochon. an RPI
freshman, gave the girls a little
workout, (they're wondering what a
real workout would be like since they
were stiff for four days afterward).
However, just as big a crowd is ex-
pected tomorrow.

Mr. Mochon hopes that he may be
able to get fellows from other col-
leges to come and give exhibitions

Downpour Postpones
Awarding of Cup
At Annual Banquet

Florence Garfall and Nora Gia-
velli, finalists in the Women's Ath-
letic Association’s Tennis Tourna-
ment, will meet in Washington Park
this afternoon to decide the winner
of the first tourney to be completed
since 1937. This contest had been
scheduled for yesterday afternoon,
but a continuous downpour made it
necessary to postpone the match.

Elswood Eliminated

Wednesday afternoon Nora de-
feated Eva Elswood in a semi-finals
contest which ended 6-3, 6-2. The
winner, Who had reached the second
round of the Men’s Intramural Ten—
nis Tournament a few weeks back.
used her beautiful serve to good ad—
vantage. In the beginning she hit
over the base line, but after finding
her aim she was superior to her
opponent. Eva was good in placing
her shots, constantly getting them
low over the net.

Miss Garfall played hcr semi-fin-
als match against Mary Domann
Friday afternoon and Saturday
morning. She led in the first set
5-3. when the courts’ caretaker took
down the nets. Next morning they
completed the set which ended 6-3.
and Garfall took the second set with
the same score. However. Domann
had the edge on her 3-1 in the first
part of the set. Garfall does not
feature any spectacular shot. but is
consistently good.

Great Interest Shown

Great interest has been shown in
this match since this is the first
time in so long that the finalist stage
has been reached in the women‘s
tournament. The Washington Park
courts have always been closed be-
cause. of snow by the time the con—
tests were endcd. Another tliliig is
that Glavelli has aroused interest
with her good playing in the men's
tournament.

If the competition had been coni—
plctcd yesterday afternoon. the win—
ner would have been awarded a sil-
ver cup at the Annual Fall Banquet
of the Association which was held
in the college cafeteria last night. at
5:30 PM.
llafley ls Captain

Captain Lois Halley regrets that
the contests were not completed in
time to have the presentation made
before the members at the banquet.
however, the winner will have her
name engraved upon the cup soon
after the championship is decided
Miss Halley also stated that “the
spirit of the players was excellent.
and there was an enthusiastic turn-
out for both the tournament and
general tennis play.“

Miss Caroline Lester 01‘ the Malli-
cinatics Department was the main
speaker at last night's nfl‘nlr. Miss
Isabelle Johnston showed colored

 

of expert technique for the girls.

There is even talk of engaging the
fellows in some matches for fun.

Crimson Tide Vows Revenge

“What the Yanks did to the Dodg—

charge of the fresh football squid.
Similar sentiment reigns among his
crimson colleagues. who are all set
to renew the battle for rivalry points
when they tangle with the sophs
this afternoon in football.

But the Yellow Devils tu'cu't luck—

Ing for the sophs, Rich Young
threatens. “We'll get them In the

Captains Select
All-State Team

Undefeated Potter Wins

Intramural Football Crown

With the close of the intramural
football schedule each year comes
the selection of an All-State team
by the league captains. The squad
picked this year is packed with
power and would give a good ac-
count of itself against any of the
mythical teams of past years.

Two Outfits

Here is the lineup; First team:
center. Rich Young; ends, Gene
Guarino, Ed Casler; backs. Bill
Dickson. Hank Brauner, Tom Fee-
ney.

Second team: center. Harold Feig-
enbaum; ends. Leo Griffen, Baird
Poskanzer; backs, Joe Levin. Les
Graves: tied: Stan Gipp. Red Ev-
ans, Joe Tassoni, Warren Kullman.

Brenner has been the outstand-
ing passer of the season and would
carry the brunt of the All-State
DESSlllg‘ attack. Dickson would share
the passing assignments with Bran-
ner and the ball-carrying duties
with Fceney, who has stood out this
year for his running ability. Two
ﬂeet, sure-fingered ends, Guarino
and Casler. would be out there to
snare Brauner‘s passes. Their block-
ing ability would come in handy on
running plays. Young is a natural
at the center position to break up
the oppositions offensive attempts.

New Champs

A new and undefeated football
champ, Potter Club. has been crown-
ed. After downing their only worthy
rival. Kappa Beta, the Potter boys
coasted to the wire without a blem-
lsh on their record. In the five
games they played tCollege House

the opposition‘s six. Tiils touch-
down was scored by KB.

Science Department Gives
Sports Editor Headache

The sports editor of the News
certainly has his headaches
these days!

Surrounded by two junior as-
sistant editors who are rabid
science majors, he finds him-
self really ’behind the eight
ball‘ when it comes to getting
stories done in the afternoon.

“I can't make it this aft, I’ve

“Yes, me too, Mitch, and one
tomorrow," chimes the other in
a reluctant voice.

To add insult to injury, the
sophomore aspirants are like-
wise hounding Husted's labora-
tories.

plenty of time!

Cage Call Nets

Twenty-five Men

Coach Finds Only Five
Veterans in Line-Up

 

 

 

While the frenzied fans of Sat-
urday's heroes are glorifying in the
mid-season of their favorite sport.
State College is being touched by the
first tentacles of basketball fever.

Monday night State’s potential
gladiators of the court rumbled into
Page Hall for their first workout.
Under the close scrutiny of Coach G.
Elliott Hatfield, the ample squad of
aspirants strutted their stuff.

With a nucleus of five veterans
plus a huge squad of likely players.
Coach Hatfield has high hopes for
the coming season. He has secur-
ed n transfer of practice sessions
from the afternoon to the evening
thus allottlng more time for prac-
tlcc.

Another important factor that
will probably have a great effect
on the development and training of
our basketball team this year is the
lifting of the responsibility of the
Milne High “five” from Coach Hat-
field‘s shoulders.

GAR].

A puzzling international situation
seems trivial compared with that
confronting the lads who make up
the chess team.

It seems that the boys got to-
gether the other night and after
more or less of a social evening,
they decided to top off the night
with a bowling tilt.

,Well, the game progressed in fine
fashion, but when the final tallies
were added, scores in the 190’s and
upper part of the 200’s Were chalked
up. Now the boys don't know
whether to continue as a chess out-
fit or go into professional bowling.
The irony of it is, the scores indi-
cate that the current squad is bet-
ter at pin-toppling than at pawn-
pushing!

Cauliflower Comments
Tw0 of State’s prominent bas-
ketball players came into violent
contact with each other on the
dance floor during Campus night
resulting in a slight discoloration
for one which closely resembles the
color of the proverbial “eight ball.”
Here’s the story according to Harry
Bora, the proud possessor of afore-
mentioned discoloration:
“We got a bunch of guys together
to give this gal a ‘rush.’ So we’re
all cutting in on each other, when
suddenly this guy (Owen Bombard)
taps me, not too gently, and I feels
a funny ‘click’ in one eye — just
like a. camera, gee—”. Harry must
have meant the camera obscure.
Speaking of basketball men we
just heard the disconcerting news
that Bill Dickson has been request-
ed to appear for his physical exam-
ination at Schenectady. There's no
doubt as to his passing it, but we’re
hoping he can still remain a couple
of fast dribbles ahead of the induc-
tion board.
The Jackpot

After the unfortunate opening
match which the chess men played
at RPI last Sunday, Clarence Oarr
decided to phone in the story to the
local papers, via Troy.

Something went wrong and the
good mechanical apparatus dropped
seventy cents into Oarr’s mitts!

Now we ask you. just exactly what
kind of a machine drops coins into
the waiting slot???

Stiller Resigns

Al Stiller, conscientious manager
of freshman basketball has found
it necessary to leave his post in or-
der to maintain himself at State
with employment.

This is indeed unfortunate since
we remember that Al has been
tossing towels since he was a fresh-
man. Good luck, and then some, Al!
Intramural Keynotes

A fur-lined horseshoe is in order
for presentation to Gene Guarino
and Bill Marsiand for efficiently
running off a very successful foot-
ball schedule.

A Dluertation on the Proceedings
of the Constitutional Convention
of Saylu Hall.

 

Roy °

0n the evening of October 7. 1941,
history was made. The momentous
occasion was none other than the
first constitutional convention of
Sayies Hall. The founding fathers
having swung valiantly into action
the week before had submitted to
the assembled Saylesmen the frame-
work of a dandy new constitution,
conceived in perspiration and dedi-
cated to the proposition that while
you can please some of the people
some of the time you can't please
all of the people any of the time.
The lads were given a free hand to
maul the poor thing around as they
saw fit. Many not only saw but
had one, striking out choice clauses
and phrases with the ruthlessness of
a European dictator conducting a
purge.

Rules Produce Chaos

Roberts’ Rules of Order produced
its usual chaos as the harassed
chairman attempted repeatedly to
lift the shroud of mystery surround—
ing that never-failing source of tur-
moil, the “previous question." Some
of the freshmen were evidently
quite unfamiliar with parliamentary
procedure. When the chairman
shouted, “Order. please!” they res—
ponded as one man: “Beer!” One
of the hottest debates centered
around the question of female guests. i
The battle was fought fiercely, floor
by floor, as the conveiitionallst fac—
tions slowly but firme forced the
liberals downstairs, conceding atl
length the Brubacher Memorial
Lounge. The climax of the evening
came with the election of officers.
Candidates for office were asked to.
retire during each vote to the next
room, which happened to be the
kitchen. One popular lad, who had
run for four different offices finally
declined a fifth nomination. “I really
can't eat another bite,” he explained.
Original llouse Songs

To wind up the program the boys
sang their new house song, “Suylcs,
Eagles, the Garry's All Here." Yes,
Sayles Hall has a good musical
group. Already some of the facts
are starting to turn out original
Alma Maters. The following is a
sample of their work. All it needs
now is a tune:

Modern educators are guilty of
falling "to develop moral and spiri-

United States. This was the charge
made by Dr. Homer Rainey, Presi-

the 77th Convocation of the Urii-
vcrsity of the State of New York,
held last Friday in Chancellors Hall.
He also stated that educators In

Advanced Dramatics
Opens Season Tuesday

 

Class Directors to Present
Tragedy, Comedy in Page

 

Advanced Dramatics will open its
1941-42 season with a tragedy and
a comedy in the Page Hall auditor-
luni on Tuesday at 8:30 P. M. The
student directors are Ethel May
Tozier and Lenora Davis, juniors.
Miss Agnes E. Futterer, Assistant
Professor of English. is supervising
the productions.

Miss Tozier’s play is a somber,
deeply tragic story of the struggle
of a group of Irish people against
their environment. Gertrude Gold,
'44, will portray the character of
the old Irish peasant woman who
has already lost a husband and six
sons in the sea. She and her two
daughters endeavor to save the
youngest son from the same fate.
Betty Marston, '43. Lois I-Jampel, '44.
and John Lubey, '45. are cast in the
other roles.

In direct contrast is the light. hu-
morous play under Miss Davis“ dir-
ection. The uproarlous complica—
tions which ensue when a typical
American family think a thief has
been in the house, provide the ma-
terial for a fast—inciting comedy.
Paul Barseion, ’44. and June Mei-
ville. '43. play the horrified parents
who come home to find their dangli—
ter t'frece Aney, ’44) in the arms
