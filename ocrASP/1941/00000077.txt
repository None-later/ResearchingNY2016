Report Gives Salaries ’

The average salary for inexperi-
enced teachers is $1,191.17. Average
salary for experienced teachers is
$1,476.34. The salaries for inexper-
ienced teachers range from $912 to
$1,800. Salaries for experienced
teachers range from $1,000 to $1,900.

Students placed through commer-
cial agencies are assessed 5% of their
first year’s salary. Therefore the
Student Employment Bureau saved
the inexperienced teachers $1,187.06.
and the experienced teachers
$1,026.98 during the past year.

There is an increase in the num—
ber of placements this year because
of the national defense program.
Many one—year positions have been
created to fill vacancies caused by
the exodus of teachers to the army.
Jobs in the defense industries are
also attracting some graduates.

Epsilon Tou Omega Will Sponsor Drive
To Build Up Blood Reserve AI Hospital

All red-blooded persons can now
have their place in the sun. Start
eating those proteins, lads and las-
sies, Albany Hospital needs your
blood.

Three weeks ago, Albany Hospital
started a blood bank. Epsilon Tau
Omega, the State College Service
Fraternity, is sponsoring a drive to
build up the bank and asks State
College students, either men or wo-
men, to volunteer. At least ten
volunters are wanted within the

 

next two weeks.

Each person who receives some of
this blood, becomes automatically
indebted to the blood bank. Has to
replace the amount of blood which
he received himself, get a friend or
relative to donate it. or pay a pro-
fessional donor to replace that same
type of blood.

After the blood is received, it is

kept at 5 degrees Centigrade for!

seven days. During this time it is
used as “whole blood." that is, for
transfusions. At the end of seven
days. the red corpuscles are removed
and the "whole blood” becomes
plasma. useful in building up resist-
ance in persons susceptible to dis-
ease but not adaptable for transfu-
slons.

Thirty quarts of "whole blood"
of the various types must be on hand
at the hospital for emergencies. The
Albany Hospital has fallen below
this minimum. Students are re-

questcd to donate one pint of blood.’

still backing the Newman freshmen
in their support of Garfall. other
group houses have taken no deﬁnite
stand. Nora Crumm and Mary

the threat of male domination in
their class, united. On the first elec-
tion with the men‘s vote split many
ways, the presidency narrowed
down to a choice between Peggy
Dee, backed by Pierce Hall, and
Garfall, supported among others
by Newman Hall. The result was a
question of which way the men‘s
dorm would vote and the revote
shows that Garfall was their choice.

* Elected.

 

The campaign was vigorouS and
hardfought. Signs boosting all can—
didates were placed in conspicious
spots in the halls and great inter—
est was shown in the election. Two
hundred and six freshmen, all who
were eligible, cast their ballots in
the first three hours of the elec-
tion. This is an unusually high
figure for a class election.

Revote figures show that Gui-fall
was elected by the margin of 24
votes, showing definitely the choices
of the class.

With nine of the offices open to
the men, only four have been elecl-
ed. For the four major officcs, two
men were chosen.

Forum Plans Discussion

OI Political Parties

The Republican, Democratic, So-
cialist. and American Labor [Lil‘le
will undergo a thorough dissection
in a panel discussion of the Forum
on Election Day, November 4, at
3:30 P. M. in Room 206. Four stu-
dents, who are to participate in the
discussion, will demonstrate the dill
fercnccs in the programs of the four
parties and explain what they offer
to the American people.

At the Forum's meeting, Tuesday,
three amendments to the state con-
stitution, which will be voted upon
in the coming election, were debat-
ed and voted upon by the members
present. The first amendment, con-
cerning the appropriation of funds
for the construction of state high-
ways, was voted down. An over-
whelming 45-5 vote against an
amendment proposing to extend the
term of State Senators from two to
four years defeated this amend-
ment.

Advanced Dramatics
To Give Plays Tuesday

Student Producers Will Direct
Comedy, Historical Farce

Advanced Dramatics students,
Kathleen Martin, and Barbara Ker-
lin, juniors, will present two come-
dies in the Page Hall auditorium
Tuesday at 8:30 P. M.

Miss Martin‘s play promises to be
a sophisticated portrayal of the sub-
terfuges at the court of an ancient
Pharoah IJames McFeeley, ‘44). Tir-
ing of his queen (Jane Curtis, ‘43).
the Pharoah plots to do away with
her and substitute in her place the
enticing young woman who has cur-
rently captured his fancy (June
Melville, '43). However, he misjudng
the cleverness of his wife who
adroitly turns the tables on her rival.

The play directed by Miss Kerlin
is an entertaining family comedy
with its setting in the lower middle-
class home of Henry Slater, a meek
and henpecked husband (Art Col-
lins, ‘45), and his grasping, dominat-
ing wife (Vera Willard. ’44). Their
ten-year-old daughter, Victoria,
(Betty Clough, ’45), causes her
chirpy Uncle Ben (Bob Loucks, '44)
and her overly-refined Aunt Eliza-
beih «Gertrude Myers. ‘44) both
amusement and annoyance before
the sprightly grandfather, (Bob
White, '44) uncovers a family plot
and carries off the honors in the
fray.

Lectures In Assembly

Arthur Cornelius Jr., new special
agent in charge of the Albany of-

role the Federal agents play in na-

According to Mr. Cornelius, never
before has this government been so
prepared to meet the crisis facing
the nation in regard to fifth colum-
nist affairs. Through its prepared-
ness and constant outlook for sabo-
tage, the FBI has been able to
check any such activities. This
morning's spcukcr is in charge of
the [mining of police executives in
civilian defense which will begin in
Albany Monday.

President and Mrs. John M.
Sayles, Dean and Mrs. Milton G.
Nelson, and Miss Sara Tod Dc-
Luncy, Dean of Women were in the
receiving line, and members of
Myskunia served as ushers. Those
invited included the Commissioner

tired faculty members.

The guests made a tour of inspec-

This time. no chances are to
be taken. A special squad is to

forms are going to be deposited.

DrucIserWilI Talk
On War Economy

Meeting Will Be Held
Thursday Evening in Page

Dr. Peter F. Drucker. world-fam-
ous economist, author and lecturer,
will speak on the subject “The
Economics of War” at the annual
lecture sponsored by the American
Association of University Women.
The Association devotes one meet-
ing a year as a contribution to State
College students and the city of Al-
bany. This year the meeting will be
held in the Page Hall Auditorium
on Thursday at 8:15 P. M.

Dr. Drucker is the American
financial correspondent for the
“Financial Herald of London" and
the “Glasgow News”. He is the
author of two books, one on econ-
omics and the other on Nazi Ger-
many, and is considered to be the
best informed economic and finan-
cial speaker and writer in America
today. He contributes articles to
Harpcr’s and Asia magazines and
The New Republic among others
and has been a frequent guest on the
Chicago Round Table radio program.

College Cafeteria, on the increase in
the cost of food products. and the
reason for the increase will be ex-

Soyles Questions General Use
Of Brubocher Memorial Lounge

Dr. John M. SIYICI

"Use of the Brubacher Memorial
Lounge in Sayles Hall by the entire
student body is a subject that has
never been discussed,” Dr. John M.
Sayles, President of the College,
stated in an exclusive interview
with the Sum Cocteau News
this week. A Nuwa reporter met
with the President to talk over
questions and topics of general in-

 

terest to the student body. The
use of the Lounge and the acces—
sibility of the men’s dorm to male
commuters were among the sub-
jects on which Dr. Saylcs com-
mented.

As far as Dr. Sayles knows, the
dorm has never been locked to
male commuters, although such a
case has been reported. The Presi-
dent sees no reason why the Me-
morial Lounge should be open to
State College any more than the
Green Room of Pierce Hall. The
questions will have to be taken up
with the administration.

When asked his opinion of the
student — faculty discussion group,
Dr. Sayles declared that he is much
pleased with the idea, "I think the
plan affords a very fine opportu-
nity for the students. It will be a
general clearing house for matters
of trouble of the student body. The
problems will be presented in open
meetings, and both faculty and stu-
dents will offer suggestions. Thus
both the administrative and under-
graduate sides will be heard."

Dr. Sayles is very much pleased
with the job done in cleaning up
State College. He has received
comments from all sides on the
improvement in appearance of the
entire school. Evidently the stu-
dents have taken the slogan “Keep
It Clean" to heart.
