' Starts Practice

Brenner end Dickson
Will Co-ceptein Teem

“We have done no scrimmaging.
We have worked wholly on funda-
mentals so I can make no comment
on how the team will look." That
is the status of varsity basketball at
the present writing to quote Coach
Hatfield. But he had plenty more
to say.

The squad is rounding into shape
slowly but surely. One advantage
over last year ls that the men are
working-out in the evening instead
of the afternoon.

Veterans Important

The nucleus of the uncut squad
of about twenty consists of Hank
Brenner and Bill Dickson, co-cap-
tains, and lettermen Moose Gerber,
Tom Feeney, and “Bye” Benton.
Benton joined the team toward the
end of last season. Coach Hatfield
looks to Bill Forrest, Bob Combs,
Fred Beyer, Bill Marsland, Bill
Miller, and Henry Ruback, all up
from last year’s frosh squad, to bol-
ster the team. Untried aspirants to
varsity berths who show promise
are Leo Griffin, Art Flax, Bob Sei-
fert, Don Demick. Avrom Koblenz,
Howie Lynch, and Ed Reed.

Coach Hatfield promises to keep
an “absolutely open mind" in his
selection of a varsity team. “I'm
not set on anything. So far as the
boys are concerned, I'm not inter-
ested in what they did or didn't do
last year. What I am interested in
is how they can take hold this
ywr'u

Strict Coaching

The coach points out that there
will be no individual stars and that
the squad has height which has
been lacking in past years. This
should tend toward a smoother-
working unit. One weakness is
lack of speed, but the coach feels
confident that the team will be able
to compensate for that.

The unbalanced schedule may
prove a bug-a-boo to the team. It
was found necessary to play Clark-
son and St. Lawrence on successive
nights on the team's first trip.
Moreover, these teams will come
here to play on successive nights——
and all these games will be played
before Christmas.

The schedule which was referred
to previously, will be released in the
next issue.

STATE COLLEGE NEWS, FRIDAY, OCTOBER 31 , 1941

Behind
The
Eight
Bell

 

CARI.

At this time the Royal Order of
the Ebony Sphere welcomes into its
membership, one Bob Coombs who
may be seen any day sporting a
“beaut” of an inky halo circling his
left orb.

Bob tries to tell us that he got it
in the rivalry game with the fresh
last Friday. Perhaps this statement
would be more accurate if the word
“game” were omitted.

The Royal Order of the Ebony
Sphere has been instituted in order
to organize a group of lads who give
definite proof that they are. or re-
cently have been — “behind the
eight-ball.” Members will be re-
ceived through this pillar weekly.

We were aware of the fact that
there is a shortage of men in State
but the acuteness of the situation
has just been brought to our at-
tention.

Francis Mullin recently received
a note from Marge Ackley, secre-
tary to Miss Johnston, requesting
him to appear to arrange a gym
period.

This week we feel that the pro-
verbial flannel night—cap should be
presented to the current Intramural
Council for its decision to retain,
rather than retire, football and
basketball trophies.

For the past few years it has
been generally understood among
the participants in these sports
that the trophy would remain in
the permanent possession of the
team winning it three consecutive
years. This has not been carried
out.

Trophies are relatively cheap—
cspecially those purchased by the
council. Why, then should the
council react different than the
administration itself, which allows
an expensive trophy to be kept by
the group winning it under the
same conditions?

And thirty.

Intramural Basketball
Contains Minor Changes

Having successfully completed its
autumnal program, Intramural
Council announces that it is ready
to embark upon its winter schedule.

First on the list comes the annual
inter-group house basketball loop.
This year the league will be under
the supervision of Ken Johnson and
Hal Singer. It was also announced
that several changes for ihc better
will be instituted.

In order not to conflict with the
varsity practice sessions, games will
be played on Tuesday, Thursday.
and Friday afternoons, starting at
4:00 o'clock on the Page l-lnll court.

Each team is to encounter each of
lhc others twice insieud of the form-
or single meet.

Freshmen Cegers
Begin Practice

State’s potential frosh cagers
romped on to the Page Hall court
Monday afternoon to begin the first
practice session of the new season.
Under the eagle eye of Coach Hat-
field, Assistant Coach Paul Merritt
is putting the boys through their
paces. As yet they have had no ac-
tual basketball scrimmage, but
through effective calisthenics and
various other drills the frosh are
being whipped into shape.

Some of the candidates have had
experience while athers have not;
but as assistant coach Merritt said,
“They have a definite competitive
spirit. They are perhaps better or-
ganized than any freshman group
has been for some years. It is this
spirit of competition and organiza-
tion that goes for the making of a
smooth working team of any kind."
With such a good start we can ex-
pect the Fresh to carry well the
colors of '45 in their schedule of 10
tough games against such worthy
opponents as Albany Law, Delhi,
R. P. I. Fresh, Union Frosh, Al-
bany Academy, Albany Y. M. C. A.,
and Albany Y. M. H. A.

Mullin Deieats Finer
To Win Tennis Tourney

Fran Mullin has emerged as the
tennis champion of the Freshman
class by virtue of his decisive win
over Norm Finer, 6~2, 6-0. For ’llS
efforts, Fran was presented witl :i
trophy in this morning’s chapel

Due to an injury sustained in last
Friday's rivalry football game, Dick
Beach was forced to forfeit his
match with Finer, thus hastening
the deciding contest which took
place in Central Park, Schenectady.

The Schenectady courts are pav-
ed with macadam. as opposed to the
clay courts of Washington Park, but
it is generally admitted that neither
candidate had an advantage due to
this fact.

Mullin displayed fine form and
played a consistently brilliant game.
Finer also showed up well at the
start but he was obviously out-
classed.

This department wants to extend
its heartiest congratulations to Flo
Garfall for her great victory in the
WAA tennis tourney. Despite ob-
stacles of schedules and weather.
she was able to complete her con-
tests and can look forward to seeing
her name inscribed upon the silver
cup recording for posterity the
names of WAA's tennis champs.

After being met as usual by the
faithful “De Witt”—the grocery boy
with a battered but serviceable truck
which carts both blanket rolls and
girls up the long hill to Camp John-
ston—State College’s female Daniel
Boones entered the solid cabin to
discover a great loss. (Something is
always missing, you know.) This
time it was the venerable and dear-
ly beloved vic. It was gone—where
to no one knew—and all that re-
mained was a broken record on the
hillside—appropriately entitled “Gu-
iiig, Going, Gone"!

Saturday nite a great deal of ex-
citement was in order when Evelyn
“Put” Putnam casually stepped from
her second story bunk to the floor—
result—one sprained ankle. What
would have happened if she had
stepped from the third story!

In WAA Tennis-

Gievelli Takes Early Leed
But Drops Two Straight

Florence Garfall beat Nora Gia-
velli in two close sets, 7-5, 7-5, Fri-
day afternoon to annex the title in
the Women's Athletic Association’s
Tennis Tournament. This history
making match was the first one to
reach the finalist stage in any tour-
ney since 1937, and aroused much in-
terest among the members of the
student body.

Nora served first, exhibiting the
power that has established her repu—
tation in Albany tennis circles. Af—
ter the first game taken by Flo,
Nora won five in a row. However,
Flo fought back, and captured six
straight to win the set 7-5. It was
hard won as each point went to
deuce and then add.

The second set increased in speed
and import. Cautious volleying was
abandoned as Flo sent over balls
with a terrific cut on them. Nora
had to run up to meet the ball. but
held her own by superb cross court
shots. The girls took their services
and the score went to 4-4, then 5-5.
with the ball going over the net
with more force than ever. The air-
tight game of Garfall gave her a
7-5 victory in the second set. The
match lasted 1".‘4 hours, demonstrat-
ing the stamina of the girls.

Captain Lois Hailey reports that
at least fifteen girls will receive
credit for tennis as a Fall sport.

Thompson to Plan
Better Sandwiches
For Concessions

Increased Operating Costs
Aliect Annex Celeterio

In response to the plan for in-
vestigation of annex and cafeteria
prices, Miss Laura Thompson, man-
ager of the two concessions, dis-
closed that the Annex plans to sup-
ply more ﬁlling sandwiches in the
future. She feels that most of the
students do not realize that other
things beside actual cost of food
enter into the operation of the
annex and cafeteria.

“Equipment for preparing food
must be kept up and new equip-
ment bought,” she explained. At
the beginning of the year, a new
dishwasher, steam table and a re-
frigerator unit were installed. The
refrigerator unit alone cost $399.
The installation of these was essen-
tial. since the old equipment was
giving out. Small kitchen items also
had to be purchased.

Operating on Small Profit

Besides the equipment, salaries
are paid to student help, taking $40
a Week out of the $125 allotted to
pay employees. Operation is con-
ducted on a very small profit.

Actual food costs have also in-
creased greatly. Eggs, for example,
have gone up to fifty or fifty-live
cents a dozen, and ham costs 51
cents per pound. "A profit of only
three and a half cents is made on
each bottle of milk,” Miss Thomp—
son said. Other items correspond
in cost; soap powder sells for $50
in the bulk lots the annex buys, and
oil has doubled in price.

Delivery Adds ’l‘o Cigarette Cost

As for cigarettes. Miss Thompson
explains the reason for their soil—
ing at one cent more per pack than
the 00-01). The Annex buys cigar-
ettes from a firm which delivers
them, while the Co—op obtains cig—
arettes direct from the store, thus
eliminating the delivery cost.

Tomato and bacon sandwiches in
the future will contain two slices
of tomato and one slice of bacon,
Miss Thompson said. The manage-
ment of the unnex and cafeteria
welcomes student opinion and wants
to know when they are dissutisiied.

from 8 until 12 P.M. The theme of
the party will emphasize a carnival
spirit. Bazaars will be erected, some
of which will feature a pop—corn
concession, penny-pitching, and a
shooting g..llery. State women will
add to the evening by serving- as
cont checkers and bartenders. There
will also be dancing during the

Brubacher Lounge
Is Open Nights

Income From Seyles Hell
Limits Use of Memorial

The impression given last week in
the STATE Cotonou News that gen-
eral use of the Brubacher Memorial
Lounge by the entire student body
was being questioned was erroneous
and needs clarification.

The Brubacher Memorial Lounge
cannot be opened to the student
body in the day-time until there is
an adequate personnel staff at
Sayles Hall. This statement was
released by A. Harry Passow, '42,
Chairman of the Committee for
Raising Funds for the Equipment in
the Lounge, after a conference with
Dr. John M. Sayles, President of
the College, Mrs. Bertha E. Brim-
mer, Executive Secretary of the
Alumni Association, and Mr. Paul G.
Bulger. Director of Sayles Hall.

Saylcs Hall was originally planned
to house 134 men. Since there are
now 51 in the building, the income
from such a minimum number does
not provide funds for an adequate
staff of caretakers. such as there are
at Pierce Hall. During the day, Mr.
Bulgcr, the director, is busy in
Milne High School, and all the resi-
dents nre attending classes. Since
a $300,000 building could not pos-
sibly be left open. it has been de—
cided to keep the doors of Sayles
Hall locked during the day time. All
members of the student body may
use the Lounge during the evening
hours after dinner, in the some way
as the Ingle Room is used.

Student Association money —
$504.85, contributed to the purchase
of about 30% of the furniture in
the Lounge. In any of the appro-
priation given to furnish the
Lounge, there was no provisxon
made for cleaning or for deprecia—
tion of the furniture. Since $1.50 a
day is needed to clean the Lounge

VOL. XXVI, 

Commission Suggests
Plens For Maintenance

Oi Ferrell Residence

“Before the idea of a student
Union is brought before the student
body of State College, a complete
and thorough investigation of the
actual cost of furnishing and main- '
taining such a building should be
made." This was the opinion ex-
pressed by Dr. Milion G. Nelson.
Dean of the College, at the first
meeting of the faculty-student dis-
cussion group held Tuesday at 4:30
P. M. in the Lounge. Those present
were activity heads, faculty mem-
bers and a few independent stu-
dents.

Dr. Nelson’s statement followed
the suggestion of Fred Ferris, ’42,
representative of Forum and New-
man Club, that student opinion
should be solicited as to whether a
Student Union is needed or desired
by the students.

Student Reception Proposed

Organization of a committee to
conduct an extensive research on
costs was advised. In order to ac-
quaint the student body with the
facilities of the Farrell Mansion, it
was proposed by activity heads to
open the building for a student re-
ception.

Problems relating to the conver-
sion of the Farrell Mansion into a
Student Union were discussed and
plans for solution offered. Among
the topics reviewed were: the cost
of furnishing and maintaining a
Student Union; means of raising
the necessary funds; the utilization
of the various rooms in the man-
sion. Furnishing the mansion pre-
sents a major problem. There is a
possibility of raising the money by
degrees and furnishing the build-
ing gradually. A thousand dollars
per year could be taken for fumi-
ture from the money possibly forth-
coming from student tax tickets and
the college budget.

Passow Advances Plan

A plan for financing the Union
was advanced by Harry Passow, ’42,
Chairman of the Student Union
Committee. This plan provides for
the addition of one dollar to the
price of student tax tickets, making
the net cost fifteen dollars. By tak-
ing five dollars from each tax, thus
allowing the Student Association
budget only ten dollars from every
tax ticket. approximately ﬁve thous-
and dollars would be obtained for
use in maintaining a Union. This 1

Band Committee Motion
Discussed in Assembly

Discussion of a motion concerning
the formation of a committee for
the hiring of bands for school func-
tions was the main feature of to-
(inv's assembly.

The resolution discussed was:
“Resolved: That a committee of
three members consisting of one
member from the sophomore,
junior, and senior classes be ap-
pointed by student council upon
rec;nnmendntion from various class-
es to set up an orchestra. agency
within college whose duties it shall
be to get bands for all college danc-
es.” The motion was proposed by a
committee of class vice-presidents,
headed by Miss Mildred Mnttice, '43.
This committee was provided for in
the resolution passed by the Stu-
dent Association last May concern—
ing a collegiate dance band agency.

No Classes Tuesdey

There will be no college classes. .
Tuesday, November 11 because of 
the Armistice Day holiday, accord-
ing to Miss Elizabeth Van Den-
burgh, Registrar. Millie High School
will not be in session either.

Classes will be resumed Wednes-
