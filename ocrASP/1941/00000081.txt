GINNY .________

’Member way back last semester
when we had that griping assem-
bly about the budget? ’Member all
the hullabuloo about the appropri-
ation WAA wanted to spend on a
printed handbook?

Well, all the questions asked then
about WAA’s purposes were ans-
wered this week. The FIRST
printed WAA sports handbook has
been issued!

With Anita Helm at the helm.
the staff of Seniors, Sally Beard.
Mary Irving, and Mary Susan Wing
put out a “whopping big” little
book telling all about the activities
offered to the college by WAA.
Their descriptions of all the sports
are both entertaining and inviting
with their conversational tone.

 

Greetings to Fresh

With greetings from Prez Peter-
son. Miss Johnston and Dr. Creas—
dale, the book will be a memento
to the Fresh of their ﬁrst year at
State. and will serve as a record
of their participation in sports
throughout their stay here. This
latter will be accomplished by the
use of the last few pages.

Perhaps one of the most notable
features of the new book is the
photography of Dr. Dobcll. Wield-
ing a tennis racquet high in the
air, Kay Peterson literally sweeps
across the page in good form. Last
year's campus queen candidate
Mike Scesney shows just what the
perfect archeress should do. Gus-
sie Haushalter and Sally Beard de-
fend their goal nicely in the hockey
picture, and Janet Smith does right
well with a golf stick. The ﬁnal
picture presents Helen Henessey
about to send a softball on its way.
These pictures all combine beauty
of setting with grace of motion and
just shout their invitation for all
to join the girls.

Participation Rules

Lastly the book contains all the
rules for participation and awards.
and WAA's constitution. What
could be handler?

To the uninitiated let lne say
this is the ﬁrst time that anything
of its kind has been presented to
State. Everyone connected with this
publication deserves an orchid.

Notice to the upperclassmen.
Anyone of you who may desire a
copy of the book. which was dis-
tributed to the fresh only, may go;
one by contacting Anita.

Riding Records Requested

Riding jauan are still going
strong. with a French madamoisel—
18 even joining the girls. Captain
June Clark requests that girls who
go riding individually would obtain
slips from the riding master at-
tcsting to the hours spent at the
stables. These slips should be sign—
ed and turned into June for credit.

State's Hockey Team

scniatives to the recent w..mcn‘:~.

ten trimmed State to the tune of

the ball through for the only Slate
goal against Russell Luge. However, it
must be remembered that the latter
has a physical cd department and
specializes in such sports as hockey.

Group Houses
Prepare for I-M
League Action

KB Pre-Season Favorite
Buf Will Be Hard Pressed

By Malcolm “Red” Evans

Ken Johnson and Hal Singer, of
Intramural Council, announce that
the men’s basketball league will get
under way very soon.

College House, defending cham—
pions, should find the gomg very
hard. Hank Wise, Dick Hisgen, and
Cliff Swanson are a few of those
whom we may expect to see in ac-
tion this year. The loss of Carney,
Quinn. Kaufman, Benton. and An-
derson has reduced their hopes of a
championship to more dreams of
past success.

KB Likely Leaders

Kappa Beta seems to be the first
team which we may class as a
championship outfit. They have vet-
erans from last year’s team, Bitt-
m.in, Levin, Feigenbaum. and Pos-
kanzer. They Will be greatly aided
by the addition of S01 Stolbof. and
Leo Flax. an ex-varsity performer.

Kappa Delta Rho will present a
team which will not be strong
enough to be assured of the top
berth, but they will be a definite
threat to the rest of the league.
Owen Bombard. Les Graves. Ray
Verrey, and Frank Vere. will help
make them an interesting foe.

SLS is another team of great pos-
sibilities. However. too much cm-
phasis has been placed on a few

Slated to Tackle Dillicult Schedules

 

Team Plays Five Games
Belore Christmas Holidays

Within one month of the present
writing, state College‘s quintet is
slated to enter upon one of the
toughest schedules ever to face any
Hatfield-coached team. Starting off

, like a bolt of lightning on Decem-

ber 5, the Purple and Gold is sche-
duled to take the floor five times
in a fortnight.

Meeting Clarkson and St. Law-
rence away on consecutive nights
to start the ball bouncing, the
statesmen will open the home
season on December 12 against a
new comer to State’s court oppon—
ents—Connecticut State. Return

tive nights, completes the pre-holi-
day portion of the schedlilc.

Niagara looms as the toughest op-
ponent in the second part of the
slate as the Purple Eagles are rated
among the top notchers of the Eas—
tern quintets. The lone R.P.I. game
will take place on the local boards
on Janualy 9; the Troy aggregation
always brings over a fel'lnicl.able
team for this traditional contest.
Elena Dropped

In cemparlson with last year's
schedule sheet, the interested observ-
er will find that State's local rival,
Siena, has been completely dropped,
thus nipping in the bud a fast grow-
ing intel'colleg‘iste rivalry with the
Leudchilie school.

Platnburg Normal and Oswego
likewise are not on the opposition
list for this year. Connecticut State
has been added to the schedule,
while Niagara University returns
after a lapse of one "ear. In their
previous meeting. the Purple and
Gold bearers ckcd out a 51-50 thrill—
er over the Western lads.

Although last year's basketball
squad participated in one more
game. this year‘s varsity faces a
Notrc Dame-like schedule which
docs not contain a single breather.
Of the twelve games listed, only four
will not be contested on the Page
l-lall gym. thus providing the student
Lody with ample opportunity to see
[he varsity ili action.

Fresh Quintet Will Play
Eight Games at Home

Coach Elliot Hatfield has an-
nounced the complete Fresh bas—
ketball schedule for 1941-42. The
slate lists eleven games. including
the traditional battle with the
Sophs.

The local fans will receive plenty
of opportunity to see the yearlings
in action. Since the boys will make
eight appearances in the Page Hall
gym. No doubt in the interest of
conserving gasoline, the term makes
but three trip this season, the Delhi
journey being the only one of length.
Three New Opponents

Missing from this year’s schedule
are Siena. Albany Business, and
Plattsburg. Replacing this trio will
be Albany Law. and the local
YMCA and YMHA quintets. The
Fresh can look for some formidable
opposition from these aggregations,
since both “Y” teams consist of
many former scholastic and college
stars. State may have the oppor—
tunity of seeing Will F‘ramcnt, '40.
former State big gun in the Law
School lineup.

Despite the loss of several key
lnen. Albany Academy, the Frosh's
only prep school rival. will probably
send forth their usual strong squad
to the basketball wars. Academy‘s
zone defense and fast breaking at-
tack are an annual headache to
freshmen teams.
ltPl Strength Unknown

Though little is known of the
strength of Union and RPI's year-
lings, capable and hard-driving
teams ll.\’0 been the rule in the
past. Playing on the huge RPI court
the night following the Union on-
counter will tax the Frosh's staying
power to the utmost. Delhi. the oth-
er team on the slate, had a bruising
but sharp-shooting club last year
and should have several of the same
men in this year's lineup.

If .111 the opponents live up to
past performances, the '45 standard
bearers may plan on several gruel—
ling cveiiings this winter. With such
lust opposition the Fresh may count
on storing; up some valuable exper—
ience for their varsity years.

Coach Will Cut
Squad to Filteen

State's vn'sily aspirants will be
led to thc chopping—block any day
now by the gentle hand of Coach
Hatfield. The fifteen men who sur—
vive tiic cut will make tip the varsi—
ly team.

“Until the team is actually rc-
duccd, l won't commit myself." says
the coach. "I admire the spirit that
has bccn shown so far. and I don't
want a single fellow to think that
he cgiii'l make the team. There is
plcnly of mulcrllii for u fifteen-mull
squad; liic question now is quali-
ty."

There Will be only two or three
scniors on the lcum. Although some

Behind
The
Eight
Ball

 

CARL

With no deﬁnite date set for its
beginning, Intramural bowling is
now in its last stages of organiza-
tion.

Co-chairmen of the bowling
teams are Gene Guarino and Don
Demick.

The chairmen face a time prob-
lem, since they must run off the
games in the afternoon from 3:30
to 5 o’clock.

On Tuesday, Thursday and Fri-
day the basketball group will be in
action thus taking many of the
sportsmen from among the ranks
of the eagers.

Catchy Etchings

Displayed on the MAA Press Bu-
reau bulletin is a cartoon done on
the spur of the melnent by a tal-
ented senior, Armede Black. The
drawing represents an actual mo‘
ment of play in the ping pent.r
game which was particularly ap—
pealing to her—in a rather humor-
Oils way. Miss Black has promised
to do more of her fine work in the
near future.

The Ebony Sphere

Again the Royal Order of (he
Ebony Splich triumphs with the
addition of five new unfol‘tunatcs.

Topping the list this week is Ed
Reed, who is sporting a neat size
twelve cabin cruiser with red and
blue spots a little to the right of
his sniffer. Reed and Marsland “c01—
lidcd" under the basket Wednesday
night—yeah!

Next comes Art Flax who really
earned the right to sport an eight
ball pin for his up to-the-minute
answer in an accounting class the
other day.

The instructor was driving a
point home by saying, “Do you
realize what makes the big differ-
ence in these accounts?" Art had
the solution in a Flax-Flash—
“MODERN DDSIGN"!

Also in the ranks of the shady
octagon circumference wearers is
Teddy Hornbeck who gives as her
reason—“the United States Army.”
Joining in from the other side of
the library table is Dcloris Brcg'e
who was allowed in under the Wire
for what she gives as “unprintablc
reasons.”

Clyde Corson felt that the fuel
that he was a student at State was.
cnough to justify his being behind
the eight ball.

Although membership was for-
merly restl'ictcd to nieli, the women
are now insisting upon representa-
tion. Only Sadie Hawkins remains
aloof!

This is the first in a series of (H‘-

State College.

Everyone who comes to college
has one major problem to decide
and that is—~where to live. It all
depends upon what you are look-
ing for. whether it be privacy, fel-
lowship, fun, or just a place to eat
and sleep. That lncans that the
college man must pick out a fra-
ternity, an independent house, or a
dormitory, according to his tastes.

Of the four independent houses
on the campus, College House. hold—
ing nineteen students. is the lﬁrg-
est. It is a large brick building on
Central Avenue. once owned by mil-
lionaires until the business district
moved next door.

Entirely Student Managed

It is run entirely by studclils
themselves. Each member is, givcn
an opportunity to work for part of
his room and board. Consequently,
the average price each wcck is
about $6.25. The house manager.

It operates very much like u fru~
tcrnity. for officers are elected, fre-
quent dances are held. and bunqlll’ls
are given. There is a close cooper-
ation between the members :‘nd ii
spirit of brotherhood.

At present, the house is being
renovated and painted, new linoic—
ums are being laid, and a new furn-
ace is being- installed.

Low Cost of Rooms

Robin Hall is il‘ll‘ rcsitlcncc ol
seven State College students. who
room at the low cost of $2.30 pcr
week. while Avalon Hall provide..-
roolns for four students. who pay
$2.75 a week. Many students who
live at these houses claim that with
the average cest of $3 a wcck for
food, these places provide p liic
cheapest cost of living at any of llic

NYA Receives

increase in Funds

Tile Federal Government through
lhc National Youth Administration
has increased the amount of money
to be allotted to State College stil-
dcnts. This increase has been made
possible through a reapportionlncnt
of funds to colleges throughout New
York Slate. A socialized policy has
been instituted in which funds are
disli'ibulcd according to the particu-
lar need of individual schools. This
new policy enables State College to
receive us much money as the Dean
of Women deems necessary for the
wcllarc of State students. This
makes possible an increase in in—
dividual allotments of money to a
considcriible munbcr of the present
NYA workers. In addition. it creates
many new jobs for unemployed stu-
dcnts thus alleviating difficulties
culiscd by previous cuts in appro—
pl'ialioiis.

'l‘hi. redistribution of funds has
been made because various colleges
throughout New York Stitc have
returned surplus allotments to the
general NYA fund.

Revision of the NYA program
for this your provides for a rcappor-
tioiimciil of workers“ hours. In the
past NYA has allotted a speci-
fied amount of work to be done each
month. Under the new plan the
number of hours sclicdlilcd for the
vacation months will be less than
usual. .iid a sufficient nulnber of
hours will be sclicduicd for the full
mouths to make up lhc loss of time.
It is hoped that lhls system will
aid students who in past years have
found i' almost impossible to work
full limc during Dcccinbcr and
April iii-cause of Christmas and Elis-
lci' vuculiolis.

Sludcnls who losl hours during
Slpll-mbcr because of llciuy in dis—
tributing NYA funds may make
up liliic lost during the next two
lillilllil‘s. providcd Ihcir lime curds
do not exceed $20 for cilhei' month.

Stole Moles Diller in  
As They Describe Ideal Males»

By Jeannette Shay, ’44

Boysil Now it's your turn! State
College men have as many ideas
about women as State women have
about men. Girls must live up to cer-
tain standards if they long to re-
ceive those all-important proposals
from the males who this week
venture opinions on the subject of
future mat-es.

“Most important of all," declares
Bill Forrest, “my wife’s gotta love
me." Along this same line Ed Hol-
stein says. “My wifc’s gotta think
I'm a great guy." He also requires
that she be not over six feet tall.
Paul O‘Lcary's wife must be “swell.
swoct, and solid." OWen Bombard
wants someone who can adapt her—
self to all conditions. “who can be at
home in an igloo or an African
hut." For the most part, State men
do not require perfection in their
women, bill. one bright and shining
sophomore says that he must have
a "glamour girl with a positive per-
sonality and a summa cum laude."

Stale men are afraid of red-heads.
Rich Young, when asked about the
type of girl he'd like to marry. said.
“I'll take anything except a red-
head. They're too dangerous." Earle
Snow echoed his sentiments and ad-
ded. “My wife must have an l.Q. of
at has! 130 and she must be a good
cook." It seems that gentlemen do
prefer blondcs. At least State Col-
lege men do. for of thirty interview-

Student Union——

lC()lili)ll(l‘(l from page 1, column 5)

estimate is bascd on a thousand a
your enrollment.

In discussing the ways the various
rooms could be used, Dr. Sayles said
that there are tnvo existent sets of
thought on .i Student Union iii the
Farrell Nisllsii)“; that is it can be
used as u burn. where students collie
in. roll up lhc rugs lo dance, or
find other mcuns of amuse .icnt; or
that it can be used as a cultural
and intciieclual building. Concen—
sus of opinion :it the meeting seem-
cd to indicate that a mixture of the
two ideas would be desirable.

The fact that the building is (1011-
trolled by the Alumni Association
alid not by the college was taken iii-
to considcrulioii. Any plan for util-
izing the mansion would have to be
talked over with the :issoci.lti0ii.

The final decision of lhe group
was to postpone further discussion
lintll thc next meeting.

 

ed. twenty declared a preference for
blondes. A few, however, were not
particular as to color of hair. Fred
Shoemaker, when asked whether he
liked blondes, brunettes, or red-
heads, said, “I go for all of them."
Ralph Tibbetts said, “The color of
hair doesn’t make any difference.
They can change it at will." Harley
Dingman stated, “I like in-between.
They're in style all the time."

Do men like the clinging vine
type? Well, yes and no according to
Glen Walrath who declared, “I want
someone who can take care of her-
self but who does come to cry on
my shoulder once in a while. It
makes a fellow feel good.” On the
subject of looks, it’s accent on figure
with Glen. He added, “I do my
darndest when I meet a girl to get
her to wear pumps. It shows her
legs off better."

The majority of State men do not
include money as a prerequisite for
a wife but Vince Miller asserted. “I
want to marry someone rich. of
course. and preferably old and
about to die."

A few of the men interviewed
were as definite about their future
wives as Queen Duff was about her
future husband. DOll Vanas did not
go so far as to name the person, but
he pari'ied. "If you wait a minute.
she‘ll be along. Then you can see
for yourself."

Frosh, Sophs to Hold
Traditional Debate

The frosh—soph rivalry debate,
victory in which means the win-
ning- of two points in rivalry, will
be the high light of next Friday's
assembly program. The topic for
discussion will be “Resolved: That
Powdcr and Paint are Essential to
the Welfare of State College.

Bert Kiley. Mary Studebaker,
and Rhona Ryan. sophomores, are
to represent the negative side of
the question; and Sunna Cooper,
Samuel Scott. and Louis Rabineau.
freshmen, will represent the affirm-
alive. The debate will be formal,
consisting of two eight-minute con-
structive speeches and one ﬁve-
niilititc rebuttal by each side.

Intramural debates will be held
in seminars every other week on
chnesday at 3:30 P. M. in Room
20. Glen Walrath, ’42. has been ap-
pointed to coach the members of the
