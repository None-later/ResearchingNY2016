Smith Complete: Edition:

For Use in Junior High Civics

State's faculty is very versatile—
in some respects at least. For in-
stance take the author-professors
in the Social Studies Department.
They have written and will publish
several books this year.

Dr. Donald V. Smith, has recent-
ly completed two books—“Commun-
ity Living" for seventh graders, and
“Our National Community" for use
in eighth grade civics classes. These
books do not contain ordinary text
material; instead they state gen-
eral topics, give a short description
under each, but principally afford
the student a list of references for
further study on each topic.

This novel organization of a civ-
ics book was adopted as Dr. Smith
said, “to let the students draw their
own conclusions, instead of accept-
ing ready-made conclusions of an
author."

History Through Biography

"Makers of Latin America" openly
professes to be a- text-book—but a
text-book of another color. Written
by Dr. Watt Stewart, Professor of
Social Studies at State, and Dr. Har-
old Peterson of State Teachers' Col-
lege in Buffalo. the book teaches
history in a new way. Each of its
twenty-two chapters consists of a
condensed biography of a histori-
cally prominent person. From such
a series of individual biographies,
students will be able to assemble the
facts found in ordinary history text-
books, but he will be able to asso-
ciate them with people and will thus
remember them better.

Dr. Robert Riencw, Assistant Pro-
fessor of Social Studies, is the proud
author of a book, “Calling All Citi-
zens," to be published in February
or March by the Houghton, Mifflin
Company. A junior high-school text,
it took three years to complete and
was tried out in Milne High School
for a year.

According to its author, the book
approaches the subject of citizen-
ship from an entirely new and dif-
ferent angle. Said Dr. Rienow, “The
whole purpose of the book is to get
the student to think for himself and
to ask, “What can I do about it?“
The subject matter is enlivened to
make it more interesting."

Brochure For Hi-Y

Parallel to his work in citizenship,
Dr. Rienow has prepared a brochure
to aid Hi-Y Clubs by suggesting leg-
islative proposals for the Hi-Y As-
sembly to be held this year on De-
cember 13, 14 and 15 in Albany. Dr.
Rienow believes that the Hi-Y as-
sembly should initiate constitutional
amendments as well as introducing
measures concerning state law.

The Independent Regulatory
Commission, which deals with coal-
mining and distribution. is the sub-
ject of a book by Dr. Ralph E. Bak-
er, who will probably title his brain-
child. “National Bituminous Coal
Commission." Dr. Baker used a part
of the book as his doctoral disserta-
tion which he compiled under the
supervision of the “Johns Hopkins
Craft." This association expects to
sponsor the publishing of the book
on which Dr. Baker spent four
years. ‘

Facully Examines Farrel Mansion

For Sludenl Union Possiblilies

With all thoughts about the Far-
rell Mansion centering on the feasi-
bility and the possibility of having
a Student Union, the problem arises
as to whether or not the building
itself is suited for such an under-
taking.

Last Thursday evening the man-
sion was the scene of the President’s
reception, its ﬁrst social function.
The faculty and members of the
State Education Dapartmcnt were
invited to make a tour of the build-
ing and Myskania served.

On the llrst floor there are three
large rooms. One might be used
for afternoon dancing and the other
two as lounges. For formals, all
three plus the large foyer could he
used as a dance floor. In one of
the rooms, there is a completely
hand carved fireplace. Another room
has paneling carved from one piece
of wood and is papered with Chi—
nesc wallpaper, costing $48 a roll
and requiring 21 rolls to paper the
room. The rug in that room is
valued at $2,000. A grand staircase
leads from the foyer to the second
floor and from the second to the
third floor.

Five rooms on the second floor
could be made available for student
use as game rooms. discussion
rocms, or reading rooms.

On the third floor, there is one
large room which collld be used ii'l
a study or music room and ii'l
smaller rooms which the student
activities could use.

Perhaps the lnost interesting pull.
of the house is the cellar. 'l‘he inun—

‘ “Alumni to Meet '

At Sayles Hall

The Eastern Branch of the State
College Alumni Association will hold
its fall luncheon in Sayles Hall on
November 15 at 1 P. M. Mr. Paul
Bulger, ‘36, Director of Sayles Hall,
will preside.

An informal program of State
College songs has been arranged by
David Cooke, executive chairman of
Sayles Hall. The Alumni will tour
lhc dormitory, this being the first
alumni gathering in the new resi-
dence hall.

It is the custom of the Eastern
Branch to hold two luncheons a
year, one in the fall and one in the
spring. At the spring luncheon, the
cornerstone of Sayles Hall was laid,
and now the alumni will gather in
the completed building.

Frances Smith, '28, is President
of the Eastern Branch of the Alum-
ni Association. Edna Horn, ’35, is
Vice-President, Lulu Charles, ’32, is
Secretary, and William Fullagar,
’36, Treasurer. Doris Reddich, '35.

and still more needed to compen-
sate for wear and tear, it would be
impractical to turn the Lounge into
another Commons. The rules gov-
erning the Ingle Room—denial of
the use of that room to no one—
wiil be in force in the Lounge also.

It is the desire of the Board of
Directors to make the Alumni Resi-

lege’s social life. Two weeks ago,
when the Brubacher Memorial
Lounge was completed, the men of
Sayles Hall held a general recep-
tion in Sayles Hall. Last week both
the Lounge and the Ingle Room
were used for the All-State Dance.
Many other social functions which
woud make use of the Residence
Halls have been planned. Thus a
definite trend toward centralization
of social life is shaping up.

WHEREON, a foot race will be

ways about it.

 

It all started two years ago in the
“UH Abner" comic strip when Sadie
Hawkins, the homiiest gal in Dog-
patch, set about to get her a hus--
band. After fifteen years of waitin‘,
her pappY. Hekzebian Hawkins
called together the young bachelors
of the neighborhood and said, “Boys,
ah gotta take firm measures!” With
that, he proclaimed that the ﬁrst
man Sadie caught was legally her
husband.

The idea of having a day when
co-eds could catch a man spread
quickly to the colleges of the mid-
west where Sadie Hawkins Day was
celebrated enthusiastically. At State
over 200 people signed up for it in
five days.

Women Get New Chance
To Capture L’il Abners

One day, one proclamation,
one riot—thus began the “new
freedom" for State College wo-
men when “Hey there, ii'l Ab-
ner, kin I hev a dance, kin I,
huh?" released them from the
status of forgotten females.

Three State women walked
into the News office yesterday,
presented an official proclama—
tion supplementing the Dog-
patch original, and left elated.
Marie Baiiie, ’43, and Grace
Forbes and Martha Sprenger,
freshman, declared, “Through
spontaneous decision, State wo-
men acclaim every Friday noon
to be Sadie Hawkins hour."

Almost 500 women have sign-
ed the proclamation which bade
the men to “give us a chance;
everyone of you will be at the
mercy of Slate's designing fe-
males."

Cutting will be sanctioned, but
all other rules now prevailing in
the Commons will be observed.

 

Sale of Directories

lnsullicient Advertisements
Necessiiates Small Charge

Students of State College may ob-
tain the lil4l—‘42 Directory before
they leave for Thanksgiving vaca-
tion. Directories will be on sale
Tuesday and Wednesday at 10c. a
copy in the Co—op and lower hall
of Draper.

The keynote of this year's cover
design will be simplicity, with the
State College seal against a wood-
grain background.

Nicholas Morsillo. ‘42, Editor-in—
Chief, believes that this year's Di-
i'cclory will be the most accurate in
its history. The posting of the proofs
in the lower hail of Draper found
that many corrections were needed.

Although the publishing cost of
the Directory was somewhat reduc-
ed by the sale of
advertising, the
idea on the
whole was not a
c o in p le t e suc-
cess.

The new feu-
l.ures of this
year's Dirac/org;
include adver-
tising, the social
and academic
calendar for the
school year, and
a list of the rep-
resentlilives from tho vxl'ious ucl.ivi~

in addition to those new i'culurcs,
the Directory will contain the

ward the observance of National
Art Week in Albany will be the pre-
sentation of Madame Silvereruys,
world-famous sculptress in Page
Hall Monday evening, under the
auspices of the Dramatics and Arts
Association. She will present a no-
vel lecilu'e-demonstration on “Life,
Art and :icuipture.“

Madame Silvereruys will choose a
member of the audience and do a
model of him on an. armature set
upon the stage. While she does the
model, she will lecture on the mean-
ing of art in individual lives,
interspersing the discussion with
interesting anecdotes of famous
people she has modelled. A three-
sided mirror will be set upon the
stage so that the audience may be
able to see all sides of the demon-
stration.

Now an American citizen, Madame
Silvereruys is the daughter of the
late Baron Franz Silvereruys, Pres-
ident to the Supreme Court of Bel-
gium. She has received Belgium‘s
highest honor—that of knighthood
in the Order of Leopold.

Among her most interesting ino-
(leis have been the Dionne quintup-
lcls who had never before been
modelled.

immediately following the pro-
gram l.hcre will be a reception in
the Lounge where Madame Silver-
eruys will display photographs of
her work. Members of the faculty,

Kappa Delta Rho will have its
last rush party of the season to-
morrow night from 8 P. M. to 12

Chairman, “It's unique, novel and
never before attempted at State.
Everybody'll get a surprise and
have a good time."

Tonight the Commons will be
the scene of the Edward Eldred
Potter Club's traditional "Club 45.”
The dance hall, representing any
of the gayer but lnore refined night
spots of this area, will be open

the night spot, Bert Kiley, '44, says
therc'll be plenty of clean, sober
fun with lots of rei‘reslunents, head
waiters. entertainment and noise.
It's a late permission affair. too—
iill State women have two o‘clock
hours.

Saladin and his harem, complete
wilh dancing girls, will be featured
in, Kappa Bctn's rush party. Guests
will be furnished with turbans and

Council Will Chcclt Lists.
Oi Eligible Fresh Sunday

by Janet Baxter

Speculation over fraternity bid-
ding sounds the major note in
State’s issues of the week, with the
bid distribution set for Monday from
9 A. M. to 1 P. M. Male mem-
bers of the claSs of 1945 will receive
notes on Monday morning from
Interfraternity Council, Maxson
Reeves, ’42, President, explained re-
questing them to report in the
Lounge within the designated hours
to receive their bid or bids. Signed
bids must be returned the Monday
noon following Thanksgiving vaca-
tion.

The fraternity rushing procedure
was altered this year by the entrance
of two new factors: the decrease in
masculine registration, and the pre-
sence of Sayles Hall. The male en-
rollment caused a more intensive
system of rushing, and indicates
that there will be a'iower percentage
of men pledged.

More M'uss Rushing

Addition of a men's dormitory to
State College gave fraternities more
opportunity for mass rushing. How
much effect the geographical loca-
tion of Sayles Hall had on rushing
procedure Ls a question open to
lunch discussion. Blit due to the
fact that 4 % of the men in the
freshmen class are commuters, the
dorm does not control the situation.

An analysis of fraternity rushing
and bidding necessarily includes the
past records of the four fraternities.

Conclusions may readily be drawn
from the above table, but there is no
guarantee that there will not be a
sharp reversal of fraternity posi-
tions this year. Kappa Delta Rho
may slip farther from previous years,
or may on the other hand take a
sharp rise. There is every indica-
tion that Potter Club will continue
its strong hold and thit SLS will
more than hold its own. Except for
some competition from Potter, Kap-
pa Beta is expected to keep its pres-
ent position.
