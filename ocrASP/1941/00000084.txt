times played on every Tuesday and
Thursday followed by a single con-
tent, on Friday. The first game will
begin promptly at 4 o’clock.
According to this setup, the eight

An announcement has been made
by the Hygiene department that no
one will be allowed to participate
in league games with glasses, unless
“he hands in a written permission"
signed by one of his parents or
guardians. This ruling will be strict-
ly enforced.

The charter members of the local
chapter of Pi Omega P1, national
business education fraternity, will
be announced by George M. York,
Professor of Commerce, in this
morning’s assembly.

This year the members will be
chosen from the senior class; in
the future, however, Juniors who
have completed their fifth semes-
ter may be admitted. Membership
is based on scholarship and inter-
est in the business education ﬁeld.

A committee of commercial stu-
dents under the chairmanship of
Mary Viliano, ’42, began organizing

 

Goal posts, brightly colored
pennants, and yard line mark-
ers will decorate Newman Hall

dance will be a football game
with football sayings and mega-
phones providing an authentic
atmosphere. ,

Dancing will take place be-
tween the hours of 9:30 and 1‘
to the music of Jack Gentry
and his orchestra. A large score-
board will be used to announce
the order of the dances. The

the direction of Ruth Schmitt,
’44, general chairman. It is ex:
pected that about 35 couples
will attend.

  

 

Sororities to Complete
Formal Rushing Plans

Sorority rushing will be climaxed
after Thanksgiving vacation with
the Annual Silent and Formal
Rush Periods. While sororities are
completing preparations for their
annual rush parties, the Freshmen
women will receive rushing instruc—
tions in the weekly orientatfon
class of November 24.

Silent period has been extended
this year from Friday, November
28, to Tuesday, December 9. Each
sorority will give a buffet supper
and formal dinner on December 5
and 6 respectively.

The rushees will receive invita-
tions to these parties on November
29, and are requested to return
them, having checked the parties
which they desire to attend.

On Monday, December 8, pre-
ference slips will be sent to all
freshmen women. They must be
filled out according to the order of
sorority preferences and submitted
to the Dean of Women’s office by
12 noon of the same day.

' «Squad
. Cut to Ten Men

Ten men are still battling for
positions on the freshman basket-
ball squad, following the first cut
of the season. Coach G. Elliot Hat-
field emphasized, however, that this
is but a tentative selection and it
is possible that the group may be
further whittled to eight before the
curtain raiser against Albany Aca-
demy, December 6.

The following men have survived
the axe-wielding: Dick Beach, Buck
Hippick, Warren Kullman, Stan
Gilli). Fran Mullln, Art Olivet,
Zollle Privett, John Sussina, Joe
Tassoni and Frank Woodworth.

The fact that the varsity is car-
rying fifteen men this year, will
enable the frosh to operate with
less than two teams. With intra-
mural basketball occupying the gym
three afternoons a week, the frosh
are forced to practice the same time
as the varsity. With this arrange-
ment in mind, Coach Hatfield plans
on pitting twa varsity teams against
each other and Working out the
freshmen against the third.

SCA Plans College Sunday

The Student Christian Associa-
tion will observe “State College
Sunday” November 16 with a relig-
ious service at the First Presbyter-
ian Church. at 11 A. M. Dr. John
M. Sayles, President of the College,
and Kathryn Wilson, President of
SCA, will participate.

Coach Searching. for Team, Co-ordinaior
As Squad Shapes Up for Coming SeasOn

Another Duke Hirsch or Tommy
Ryan is what Coach Hatﬁeld is try-
ing to ﬁnd among the members of
this year’s varsity basketball squad.
Someone who will not only hold
the men together on the court but
who will give spark to their play.

Tom Feeney looks like the man
for the job. It is one thing to watch
a squad go smoothly through its
plays in practice but quite another
to see that team in a game where
not only .plays but competitive spir-
it counts. And Feeney has that
spirit. His one weakneSs is his re-
luctance to shoot from the ﬂoor.

As the team shapes up so far
Bob Combs has about the best eye
on the team, but that may not
help much if he does not show a
little more spirit than he did with
the trash last year. The co-cap-
tains, Hank Brauner and Bill Dick-
son, do not quite measure up to
their responsibilities at this writ-

 

ing. Dickson was not exactly out-
standing for his scoring last sea-

son and Brauner has slowed up

considerably although he looks as
good as. ever under the basket.

Fred Beyer are three big question
marks. If Benton can check as
he did in the Pratt game in New
York last season and can learn to
use his height to advantage, he
will be invaluable to the team.
Forrest's performance fell off af-
ter his early success with the frosh
last year. He will be on his mettle
to show the team that he can
help in the scoring column. Beyer
has a great deal of natural ability
but lacks training and experience.
His pass-work is his weakest point.
Moose Gerber’s performance in
practice sessions shOWS a deﬁnite
improvement over his "hot and
cold” exhibitions of last lear.

()iimpus Chest Resolution

Don Vanas, '43. will introduce in
assembly a resolution which will pro-
vide for the establishment of a Cani—
pus Chest. If the resolution is ap—
proved, all students will be asked to
give any amount of money they can
afford to a fund from which contri-
butions will be given to the various
charitable organizations which make
appeals to the student body. The
need for such an organization was
most acutely felt last fall when four
such institutions asked for money
within a two-week period. Estab-
lishment of this Chest would elimin—
ate the necessity of such drives, all
such appeals being relegated to lilo
Chest Committee for consideration.
Campus Chest Committees

This resolution provides for the
establishment of a Campus Chest
Committee. to consist of the Presi-
dent and Vice—President of the Stu-
dent Association. thc president of
Epsilon Tau Omega and the hearts
of the three loading religious organi-
zations-"SCA. Newman Club. and
Menorah.

It will be the duty of this com—
mittee to organize and execute an
annual drive for fluids and apportion
these funds among those charities
who may apply.

A poll will be oonduchd in today's
assembly by Forum and S'm'rri Col.-
l.uoic News to determine what stu-
dents think of the foreign sittin-
tion.

As Fraternity Rushing Closes

Changed Sorority Rule;
Longer Silent Period
Distinguish '41 Rushing

State College sororities take the
social spotlight this week as the
fraternities concluded rush activi-
ties with pledge services Monday
night. Several new aspects enter iii-
to the picture this year, said Jean
Sears, ‘42, President of Intersorority
Council. In addition to the quota of
15 girls for each sorority, the length
of silent period has been extended to
ten days. It begins at 5 P. M. today
and lasts until December 9 when
pledge services will be held,

Silent period will be broken only
at the two formal rush events, buffet
supper and formal dinner. Invita-
tions to these affairs are mailed to-
day, beginning the Formal Rush
Period. Freshmen must indicate
which events they wish to attend
and return all invitations imme-
diately to the respective sororities.
Intcrsorority Council has limited
the amount of money to be spent on
each girl present.

Buffet supper is scheduled for
Friday. December 5, from 6 to
p. in. at the sorority houses, and
formal dinner on the following night
froth 7 to 11:30 P. M.

The following Monday freshmen
women will fill out their preference
slips and return them by noon to
the office of the Dean of Women.
These slips are matched with the
bid lists of the sororities, and at 5
P. M. of the some day sorority presi-
dents receive lists of the rushes who
have chosen their sororities. Fresh-
men receive final bids on Tuesday
and are pledged that. evening.

Washh'ne Full of Dorm
Since Socks Regain Favor

Democracy reigns! Down with
oppression, said Pierce Hall
counselors, and proceeded to
abolish the rule of stockings at
dinner. Only on Wednesdays and
Sundays must the fair co-eds at
221 Ontario Street struggle into
filmy hose to descend the curv-
ing staircase and into the dining-
room.

"Now I‘ll have to wash my
socks," said Muriel Scovcll, ’43,
diving under a bed and bringing
forth a conglamcration of vari-
colored footwear. Roommates
Leggctt and Soulc nodded wear-
ily. But it's worth it, agree each
and every dorm woman. Think
of the saving on nylons ($1.98 a
pair), owuy from the wear and
tear of kicks under the table.

Glenn Wiilruth, ’42, expresses
the one note of regret. “It means
suddle shoes instead of pumps
for my critical eyes, if I were
invited to dinner!”

48 Freshmen Accept
Bids in Fraternities;
Four Return Blanlts

The hectic and unpredictable fra-
ternity rushing campaigns of 1941
closed at 12:30 P. M. Monday, when
the 1945 rushces turned in their bids.
Final results revealed that Kappa
Beta led with the highest percent-
age, .777, pledging seven out of nine
freshman men bid. Kappa Delta
Rho followed with a .666 percentage.
Fourteen bids out of 21 issued were
returned to KDR.

The Edward Eldred Potter Club
slipped from its dominant position
of last year. Potter pledged 23
freshmen out of 36 bid in 1940. This
year a total of 32 bids were issued;
15 were returned signed. Sigma
Lambda Sigma had a .631 percent-
age, pledging 12 out of 19 men. This
was a drop from its last year's list
of 17 pledges.

48 Accept Bids

The total percentage of fraternity
pledges exceeds that of last year.
Out of 52 bid, 48 accepted, as
against last year's 65 bids and 59
acceptances.

Kappa Beta and Potter Club con-
liictcd on three bids. One of the
three conﬂicts signed the KB bid,
one pledged Potter, and the other
returned both bids unsigned. Three
other freshmen returned unsigned
bids.

KDR, Potter and SLS triple-bid
seven i‘reslnncn. Oi" the seven who
received bids from all three frater-
nities, three took the KDR. pin, one
pledged Potter and one SLS. Two
did not plcrlvc any fraternity. Kap'
pa Delta Rho and Potter Club
doubled up on 16 bids. KDR pledged
9 of the 16, as against 4 pledged by
its rival, Potter. SLS and KDR dou-
bled on eight men, four of whom
took the KDR pin and one pledged
SLS.

KDR Comes To Fore

KDR. came to the fore, while
Potter Club and SLS went down
slightly from their last year's stand—
ing, and Kuppu Beta’s position re-
mained fairly constant. Following
is a list of tlic pledges and their
fraternities:
