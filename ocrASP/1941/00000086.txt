' Magazine Follows Pattern;
Prize Story Is Ordinary

The Statesman, magazine of
moods, hits a high-low medium in
its first issue of the year. It has
variety, presenting both the literary
and the humorous talents of State
College. Its appeal ranges from
class to classic. There is musical
data for lovers of melody, and an
advisory column for lovers of love.
The idealist finds his poetry, and the
realist his jokes. The Statesman
balances the budget, but-—

The main fault of the current is-
sue of the Statesman is also the
main fault of most of its predeces-
sors—it is a “run of the mill” ma-
gazine. The material does not go
far enough; it only brushes the sur-
face of State talent. The selections
are not a fair representation of what
State students can produce.

Flash of Inspiration

True, there are flashes of inspir-
ation, so rare that they can only be
classiﬁed as “flashes.” Alice in
Blanderland is an excellent example
of humor, 9. cleverly written and
inoffensive take-off on life at State
and the "Great Tradition." On the
other side of the ledger, the poetry
is deﬁnitely the superior contribu-
tion of the intellectuals. The few
serious selections show State that
State can think and create and
make their thoughts live.

An issue can be made in the case
of Henrietta the Stooge. Poor be-
nighted Henrietta is the twin sister
of the Learned Daughter, an early
News Sakatalks, but less cleverly
presented. Vacation gives the im-
pression of an attempt at sustained
writing. It is too much so; its con-
clusion is flat. Consider now the Le-
ah Lovenheim prize story. Perhaps
it is sheer impudence to criticize the
judgment of the English professors.
but the critic takes the risk. It is
ordinary; its counterpart can be
found in a dozen magazines. It is
a common. unadulterated, pleasant
little romance.

Is This State’s Best?

Is this the best that State can
offer for a major contest? Ap-
parently it is. or else we must be-
lieve that State College is not in-
terested in producing anything rep-
resentative of the high standards
that do exist here. Leah Loven-
helm would be disappointed at the
quality of the material which won
her twenty-five dollars.

The idea of photography is .'l
bright spot among the too obvious
defects of our State College maga-
zine, but the photographs them-
selves are not the work of a camera-
man~»-the printing is not wholly at
fault. Give us pictures, Slalcsman
Board, but focus them.

STATE COLLEGE NEWS, FRIDAY, NOVEMBER 20, 1941

w 'Slate‘smon’ state Makes Favorable Impression

As Freshmen Express Opinions ,

by Jeanette Shay

Where is the State of the awful
reputation, the place where every-
one is stiff, studious, and serious
about life? That’s what the fresh-
men wonder. When asked this week
to express their opinions of State,
the freshmen told of their surprise
when they came here and found
State a friendly place and found
State people eager to make them
feel at home.

All the freshmen seem to be im-
pressed by the people at State and
the feeling between the students.
Collin Barnett said in this connec-
tion, “I like State because, well,
we’re all about equal financially
and potentially equal socially. No
one is snobbish.” Lucille Kenny de-
clared, “I like the people. They seem
to like to learn about things and yet
they like to have fun too.”

on the subject of men, the wo-
men had much to say. Mary Sander-
son remarked, “I like the intellectual
quality of the boys. You gotta like
somethin’ about them.” Aleen Cod-
dington said, “I‘m one girl who
thinks the men are all right.” Over-
hearing this statement, Shirley Ma-
son declared, “I like the men, too,
but there aren’t enough of them.”

“There are so many girls at State
that it’s a regular paradise for the
fellows,” said Harold Archambault.
Fran Mullin admitted that there
are “some nice girls.” But he added,
“When there are so many girls,
there are bound to be some nice
ones."

The freshmen agree with the
sophomores that they have gone up
from their knickerbockers. “One
reason why I like State," said Con-

 

nie Coburn, “is that it’s a good
place to be on your own and learn to
get along." Betty How'ell declared
that since she's come to State she
feels older and more capable of tak-
ing responsibility.”

Elsie Whipple, when asked to
present her ideas on State, offered
constructive criticism, “Why don’t
they install “chaise-lounges” in
classrooms and serve mid-class
snacks like you see advertised in
magazines? It would be much more
informal. Or why not have a turn-
stile nickel fee for freshmen enter-
ing the front door of Draper just as
a gentle reminder?”

On the serious side, the freshmen
really do have someinteresting sug-
gestions for the improvement of
State. They feel that more than
anything else we lack school spirit.
Barbara Putnam declared, “State
needs glamour. We don't brag it up
enough. Everyone acts as though
he's ashamed of it.” Buck Hippick
thinks that a “lot of the energy that
is being put into politics could be
used to create college spirit.”

Some of the other things at State
that the freshmen object to are
dirty polities, quick quizzes. the
aromas that usually float around
Huested Hall, the two and one half
to one ratio of women to men, the
library, the science course. the lack
of a campus the lack of a football
team. Nora Crumm thinks "the
school would be perfect if it didn‘t
have any studies.”

For the most part, however, the
freshmen like State very much.
Sunna Cooper went so far as to say
“I like everything about State, even
rivalry and the sophomores."

 

Annex Price Report
Theme of Meeting

The report of the committee in-
vestigating annex prices was dis-
cussed at an informal meeting of
Myskania with Dr. John M. Sayles.
President of the College, Tuesday at
4:30 PM. Items taken into consid-
eration at the meeting were Miss
Thompson's recent expenditures for
kitchen equipment and the rising
prices of food.

Annex sandwiches were compared
in price and quality to those of
neighboring restaurants, and it was
suggested that either a five cent
sandwich be reintroduced or a good
ten cent sandwich be provided. The
price of milk was also reviewed. It
was agreed that if a profit increase
is nccssnl'y. such increase should not
come from protective foods such as
milk. Dr. Sayles indicated that he
would give the matter of annex
prices his serious consideration in
the near future.

Also brought out in the discussion
was the advisability of retaining the
Coca-Cola and Pepsi-Cola machines.
It is feared that the price increase
of milk and the availability of these
carbonated beverages may lend to
an unhealthy consumption of the
latter. However. Dr. Snyics inti-
mntcd that there would be no drastic
action taken in regard to the mn-
chlncs this your.

HProcticaI Joker Wakem
Students, from lethargy

“Something new has been
added.” An alarm clock has un-
expectedly come into the posses-
sion of the State College Library.

At precisely 9:47 P. M. on
Wednesday evening, while all
those diligent scholars (com-
monly called stooges) were seat-
ed in the library pouring over
their books, the shrill, familiar
sound of an alarm clock was
heard. Everyone, startled out of
his lethargy, began to laugh with
the realization that a practical
joke had been played. Miss Helen
James, the librarian, gazed con—
fusedly about, attempting to
discover the whereabouts of the
disturbing element; it was found
shortly in a waste paper basket,
placed in the middle of the
American History section.

The culprit has not yet been
discovered, but he will pay the
extreme penalty of missing his
8:10 class every morning.

 

Advanced Dramatic:
To Give Plays Tuesday

Two one act plays will be pre-
sented Tuesday evening in the Page
Hall auditorium under the direction
of Jacqueline Shaw, and Jean Tra-
cy, juniors. Advanced Dramatics
students.

Miss Shaw’s production promises
to be a cynical thrust at the futility
of war. The boring round of gaiety
in the world of Columbine (Ellen
Swarout, '43i and Pierrot (Luke Zil-
lcs, '43! is blotted out for a while
by the onslaught of war. Against
the black background of war the
petty causes of the conflict are
thrown into bold relief.

The sophisticated comedy directed
by Miss Tracy revolves about a do-
mcstic crisis in a British household.
Meek Henry Gow iVlncc Miller ,'42)
is heartily disgusted with his own
weakness and the overbearing atti-
tude of his wife (Betty Marston.
'43:. Summoning his courage Mr.
Gow finally shakes off his shackles
and takes malicious delight in
throwing the family into terror.

    
  
  

 

Class of '44'Lcads I
As Rivalry Advanced

It’s the freshmen’s turn now may-
be. They’ve begun a counter attack.
and with each rivalry event the of-
fensive gains added impetus. But
has the sophomore blitzkrieg bogged
down under the stiffening of fresh-
men resistance? The experience of
last year’s forays enabled them to
accumulate an early lead, but the
pressure of the long siege has
brought forth traces of an early
cracking of morale.

Early in the year, taking advan-
tage of a light freshman squad, the
sophs won the pushball and foot
ball games by slight and indecisive
margins. Then the soph girls, by vir-
tue of their enormous musles, out-
ran and outjumped the freshman
women in the Obstacle Races. By
this time the freshmen began to
catch on, so when the “Battle of the
Intellects” was staged, their debat-
ers easily outspoke and outproved
the best of the sophomore class
speakers. This was the first real
indication of a challenge to the
sophomore steam roller. The points
were obtained in the following man-
ner.

Sophs Frosh
Pushball 2
Obstacle Races 2 1
Football 3
Debate 2 1/;
Total 7 3%

But the score is not a true indi-
cation of the situation. The fresh-
man girls definitely have the advan-
tage in the banner hunt, as they
have possession of the sophomore
banner.

Thus the reserve freshman legions,
after delayed action, have begun a
spearhead attack which if successful
will be followed up by a pincher
movement of freshman men and
women to the right and left ﬂanks
of the sophomore class.

Forum to Discuss Poll

Open discussions concerning the
result of the student opinion poll
which will be held in assembly this
morning and the drawing up of the
new constitution of the Forum will

GINNY

Slicing a cut from Maloney's Ba-
loney of last year, we get this tasty
morsel of thought:

“. . . bowling, a sport rapidly be-
coming an American institution. and
easily participated in by all, has a
definite spot on eVery college sports
program. We still maintain that
there are plenty of keglers in the
student body — but what can we do
about it? Is co-ed bowling the an-
swer?”

At the time Maloney was lament-
ing the lack of enthusiasm among
the males for this sport; but during
this same per-.od the females were
really rolling their own at the Rice
alleys. This year Maloney's query
is being answered by Gene Guarino
and Win Jones, who are planning
co-ed bowling every Monday after-
noon. This should awaken the men's
interest, and should increase that
of the women. As Gene said, “It
should be funl", and as Win said,
“I‘m looking forward to the future."
Later on mixed teams will be form-
ed.
lnter-llouse League

Besides this innovation, Win is
also going to inaugurate an inter-
house league bowling Thursdays on
the Western Avenue alleys. These
games will be played at a rate of
thirty—five cents for three games.
Girls desiring credit must play
twelve games.

When the skies open up and Ole
Man Winter starts his wintry blasts,
the winter sports cf skating, skiing
and tobogganing will be scheduled.
Council has appointed Sylvia Tei‘t
head of the winter sports with a
captain for each sport under her.
Anyone interested in taking over
one of the jobs should drop Sylvia
a note.

Coming Up

Sports Night is coming. In fact.
it is next Friday. December 12. WAA
and MAA are getting together pinn—
nlng a wow of a night with the
basketball game against Connecticut
State the main feature. After the
game everyone will adjourn to the
Commons for a night of fun and
frolic.

This week Kit Herdinan is organ—
izing WAA‘s third animal intramural
basketball league and would like to
see that each group house sends at
least one team to represent it in the
court loop. Last year there were
eleven tennis in the tournament.
Don't forget, fresh and sophs. you
have to get in seine practice i'or the
rivnldy game early next semester.
’l‘hrcc vcry inniortunt points are to
be nwnrdcd to the winning class.

Intramural Council Seeks
’King Kong of Ping Pong’

Aspirants for the Intramural
ping-pong crown are at present
winding up their extensive
training with light roadwork
and shadow-paddling for the
coming tourney.

Henry Brauner, last year's
runner-up, is reported to have
said, “Bring ’em on, I'll lick dose
bums." The bookies are giving
8-5 odds on Brauner despite the
severe battering he received
from last year’s champ, Jim
Snover.

Promoter Art "Jacobs" Flax
premises the public only the best
of competition.

A record gate is expected; and
everyone is urged to get his
ringside seat immediately, Since
the tickets are selling very fast.
It is also urged that spectators
remain in their seats until My-
skania "passes out."

Frosh Court Team

Shows Progress

Mullin Seen as Key Men
OI Hard-Driving Yearling:

With the opening tilt against
Academy looming ever nearer, the
fresh basketball squad has been
working out intensively under the
watchful eye of Assistant Coach
Paul Merritt.

The squad is showing definite im-
provement over its earlier workouts
and should give their Academy hosts
a real tussle come December 6.

The ball handling has improved.
and the boys really drop their lay-
ups. On the whole. the club is not
a group of “deadeyes” and seems to
prefer to work the ball in close be-
fore shooting. The absence of any
“pop-artists" should prove a bios—
sing. however, since long shots fre-
quently have an adverse affect on
the team-work of a green squad.

The key man of the team is
definitely Fran Mullin. This boy
lives up to Mont Pleasant's record
of turning out finished ball players.
Zollic Prlvett and Art Olivet, along
with Mull.n, form the nucleus 01'
the fresh attack. They both play a
hard-driving game and will pro-
vide plenty of fight.

The remaining two slots are at
present open, with Buck Hippick,
Warren Kullman, John Sussina, and
Joe Tassoni the leading candidates.
Frank Woodworth and Stan Gipp,
though handicapped somewhat by
lack of height, are fast men and
should have something to contri-
bute.

The team work is far from per-
fect. but there is a fine competitive
spirit and a lot of scrap is evident.
The team inny or may not get off to
a good start. but this squad is go-
ing to improve mightin as the
season grinds on. and by February
the fresh should be represented by
a good bull team.

WAA Terminates
Fall Sports Schedule

With the coming of cold weather
and snow flurries, the WAA fall
sports season has closed. The cap-
tulns of the various sports have
unnoullcod the people who will re-
ceive credit.

Tennis had one of its most. suc-
cessful seasons. Twouty-ilve people
competed in the tournament which
ended with Flo Giii'i’ull victorious.
Fifteen girls will receive credit for
tennis. many of whom played in the
tournament. according to Captain
Lois Hailey.

After many stormy games and u
trip to Beiinlngton College. hockey
cuptnin Juno Greenmun has nu—
iiounccd thut twonty players will
get WAA credit for hockey. Hockey
was a favorite full sport again this
your. State girls seem to go for
outdoor sports. Only three people.
lichVcr. played enough badminton
to get credit.

Swimming and fencing will con-
tinue through the winter, so credit
awards cannot be made until the
end of the season.

 

Departure ol Forrest
Deals Unexpected Blow
To Eagle Hoop Hopes

With the opening contest with
Clarkson just one week off, State's
cagers are trimming down into
fighting form. Spirited scrimmaging
has marked the drill sessions for the
past week.

The team looked very encouraging
in its practice game against a local
aggregation Wednesday. The fast
break featured State’s sparkling of-
fensive in its first real test of the
season. More scrimmaging with the
fresh and outside teams will round
out the team's preparations.

This final week will be devoted to
smoothing out the attack and select-
ing the first five. The coach is as
yet undecided on his opening lineup,
but it appears as if Brauner, Dick-
son, Feeney and Combs will be sure
starters.

 

Keep ’Em Flying

A satisfactory nickname for
States court representatives has
long been lacking. In an effort
to remedy this woeful situation,
the sports department unani-
mously voted to dub the team
the Eagles. With the nation so
defense - conscious —— and espe-
cially air-minded —- it was
thought the the name Eagles
was particularly appropriate.

The squad was handed a severe
blow when Bill Forrest decided to
leave school to take advantage of
the present industrial Situation.
Coach Hatfield had been looking
forward to his becoming one of the
main cogs of the team. Forrest will
be especially missed for his stellar
play under the basket. Rich Young
may be the man to take Forrest's
place. In the recent scrimmaging he
has shown himself to be a good team
man and a player who uses his
height to advantage.

As Fred Beyer has also found it
necessary to leave the team, the
coach has added Bob Seifert and
Red Evans to the squad.

Council to Begin
Bowling Matches

Intramural Council’s promise of
expanded activity is finally bearing
fruit. A bowling league will get un-
derway Monday. December 1, with
Gene Guarino and Don Demick act-
ing as cc-chalrmen.

The league will have exclusive use
of the first six alleys at Rice’s on
Monday afternoons. League matches
will start promptly at 3:45 P. M.
Teams not represented by five men
at the starting time will forfeit their
matches.

The teams' rosters have not been
completed as yet, but it is expected
that the league will consist oi' seven
squads. Three matches will be run
off each league afternoon with each
of the i'ive men on a team bowling
three games. The teams’ totul pins
for three games will determine the
winner of a match.

Each contestant will be charged
thirty-five cents for the three games
he bowls; Intrmnurnl Council will
refund fifteen or possibly twonty
cents of this.

A trophy will be awarded to the
winning team and one may also be
awarded to the person with the
highest individual average l'or league
games. Clarence Oiu'r has been up-
polntcd to keep the official record of
team and individual scores and
averages. Upon completion of the
schedule the i‘lVe men with the
highest averages will pliiy a team
from Sicnii College.

Basketball Managers Wanied

Attention sophomore and fresh-
mnu monl Dutch Schultze, varsity
basketball manager. has announced
that there are a number of munn-
gcrlal positions open l'or members of
both classes. There is iunplc oppor-
tunity to work up and eventually be-
come iiiiinugei' of the varsity. Fresh—
men are wanted to aid their cluss
team, while the sophomores are
needed on the varsity staff. All those
interested are urged to contact
Schultze immediately.

 

 

A“ “at. M... an...

 

    

CA!“-

With the opening of the all-im-
portant basketball season but one
week away. we find that the ship of
State sports has suffered a serious
blow with the loss of two important
crewmen.

This is our way of referring to the
untimely absences of Bill Forest and
Fred Beyer—two of the most prom-
ising lads who were recruited from
the ranks of the former freshman
aggregation.

Bill will not only leave the cage
floor but college as well. He plans to
go immediately to work.

Fred has run into scholastic diffi-
culties because of the many hours
he finds it. necessary to spend in do-
ing outside work. The only happy
thought at the present time is that
Fred may possibly be able to return
to the team next semester.

In the meantime—Good Luck, fel-
las—youth may triumphantly as-
sume maturity only when it hails
disappointment.

Intramural Holocaust

The other night a strong SLS
basketball team was royally trouncing
the representatives of the Thomas
More House during the Intramural
Council cage series. At half time the
fraternity lads led, 16-0. However,
early in the second phase of the
game, a chap named Skavina pulled
a whirling-dervish act and Slipped
in a twin-counter for the under-
dogs. Surprised, chagrined, enraged,
the leader of the fraternity quintet
called an immediate time—out and
went into a pow-wow to determine
where the serious fault was.

Well, boys, to condescend‘ to quote
the female—piloted Statesman: “give
’em a taste of Heaven” will ya?
Final score: SLS 30, TMH-8. The
junior partner of the team must
have kept the books.

Managerial Mainstnys

WAN'rini: A manager for the State
College basketball teams.

We would not be in the least sur-
prised if this ad suddenly appeared
in one of the local papers. In the
short time of only one month the
mamigcrship of the varsity basket-
ball squad has changed hands three
timesl

First, Al Stiller found that he did
not have enough time to fulfill the
duties required for such a position;
then Clay Sprowls, his successor,
found himself in the same situation
and also i'esignecl.‘Now we have a
new mnnager——onc Lothnr "Dutch"
Schultze, and he promises to stick
it out to the end.

From our standpoint, We can‘t for
the life of us, see why such a Job
would be tossed aside so easily. Chief
towel—Lesser for the varsity has
been a coveted position for years.
and unless the athletes have been
pcrspiring profusely, it still is the
same.

lead at half time. This win balances
the one previous loss of the Lake
Avenue lads.

The defending champions from
Central Avenue stumbled on their
second hurdle of the campaign when
they dropped a decision to Potter
Club. College House was a complete-
ly outclassed outfit in this contest
after making an impressive showing
against the Ramblers.

Kappa Beta's play slowed up con-
siderably as the rambling commut-
ers threw a scare into their ranks
in the game on Tuesday. The Ramb-
lers led throughout the contest—till
the last two minutes when KB eked
out a 14-11 win. Sayles Hall and
Thomas More accompany the Ramb-
lers as the teams who have yet to
come up with a victory.

The newly i'ormed men’s dorm
squad lost games to SLS and KDR,
while Thomas More, playing the
poorest brand of ball of any team in
the league, dropped its lone contest
to date to SLS, 30-8,
