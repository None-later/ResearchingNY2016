“ Some in BoihDorms;
Officers Make Rules

By Bernard Skolaky

>_ The following is the second in the
objective survey of living conditions
at State College.

“The first girl out of the dorm in
the morning is the best dressed."
This well known fact explains the
advantages of living in Pierce Hall
better than a folder issued by the
Alumni Association. With this on
one side of the ledger and the rumor
that one freshman at Sayles Hall is
the proud possessor of a pair of ﬁeld
glasses which he keeps on the desk
of his unlocked room, the living ad-
vantages of both dorms are well
balanced. '

Unbreakable Glasses

It’s a great honor to be invited to
dine at 221 Ontario Street since the
girls must pay $.70 for every dinner
guest and $.30 for a breakfast visit-
or. At dinner, not only does the
visitor run the gamut of fruit juice
to dessert, but he can have the
added attraction of dropping his
water glass on the floor repeatedly
since the glasses are unbreakable.

in bed would ﬁnd herself on a star-
vation diet. Breakfast is served

promptly at 7:15.

The dinner bell rings every night

at 6 RM. Dashing to the din-
ing room, each girl takes her as-
srgned place and the meal begins.
The chief occupations seem to be
wishing “happy birthday” to some
girl whose birthday it isn't, and com-
plaining about the food. The girls
can have as much milk as they want
and they frequently take advantage
of this fact.

New Automatic “Vic”

Dinner ﬁnished, the girls adjourn
to the Ingle Room for dancing or
bridge. The dorm girls appreciate
the new automatic “vic” which will
probably be an important factor in
promoting more “Ingle Room dates."

Returning to their $162-a-semester
rooms which they must furnish with
bedding, the girls begin to study—
that is, if the occupants of the third
floor (2-9612) will permit concen-
tration. The studying gradually
gives way to the “bull session" and
the girls talk far into the night.
When at last they get to bed, every
so often a night ﬁre drill is planned
for 2 AM. In pajamas. and carrying
a towel, the girls march out the side
doors, in the front door and down to
the Ingle Room.

Mrs. Vinall Is Hostess

The officers of the dorm act as
an administrative body, making laws
and trying to enforce them. Mrs.
Grace Vinall. Social Director. acts
as overseer and hostess.

Sayles Hall. where a room with a
view is at a premium, can easily be
found by cutting across the back
yard.

Sayles Hall is practically a replica
of Pierce Hall in design and man-
agement. The yearly cost is the
same and each dorm has a 33 tax
for house privileges, the use of the
game room, attendance at social
functions, etc.

After dinner there is a mad rush
for the telephones to get dates, prov—
ing that State’s men are no wall-
flowers. Practical jokes have 21 def-
inite place in the men's dorm. Quite
frequently a follow will enter his
room and find his bed on top of his
room mate's.

Pew Women At Saylcs

Paul Bulgcr is the Director of
Saych Hall and his wife is one of
the two women living there, The
other woman is the janitor's wife,
whom no one has ever seen.

The favorite hangout of the fol-
lows is the play room with its ping-
pong and pocket billiards. Quito
understandably most of the spare
time is spent in "bull sessions." The
follow are now looking forward to
the opening of the new gym.

Sororities

(Continued from Page 1, column 3)

Due to the limitation set on the
number of pledges a sorority may
admit, more than half of the 1945
women can not be sorority members.
If each of the six sororities takes
the maximum number of pledges, 15,
the total number of freshman sorors
Will be 90, out of a class of over 200
women. Each sorority must hand in
a preference list made out in the
order of its preferences. Addi-
tional preference lists may be sub-
mitted until the desired number of
pledges has been obtained.

Other new policies inaugurated
this year altered the rush systems
of the female Greeks. Especially in
the dormitories and group houses
where freshmen and sorority women
live together have the changes been
felt. Conversations between fresh—
men and sorority women are limit-
ed to the places where all gather.
or in the rooms if a representative
from another sorority to which the
freshman is eligible is present. The
penalty for breaking sllcnt period
will be decided upon by Intorsorori-
ty Council.

or F uture Productions

The annual Elementary Dramatics
plays have been scheduled for the
night of January 13, in the new year
of 1942. Tryouts for parts in the
three one-act plays selected were
held this week. Casts will be posted

today on the bulletin board outside'

of Dr. Jones’ office.

A tragedy and twa comedies were
chosen for the 1942 presentations.
The Street Attends A Funeral is a
character drama highlighting the
reactions of women in a mining
town when a neighbor’s son is killed
m war.

Noel Coward is the playwright of
Hands Across the Sea, a high com-
edy depending on the action of the
characters in an amusing situation
for its punch. The other comedy,
When You Are Twenty One, by
Ludwig Thoma, is the third of the
triumvirate selected to entertain
State on January 13. An absent-
minded professor has quite a time
trying to explain marriage to his
prospective son-in-law.

Miss Agnes Futterer, Assistant
Professor of English, is casting and
directing the Elementary Dra-
matics plays. Weekly rehearsals
have been scheduled.

Directory Sales Reach
Total of 750 Copies

The sales of the 1942 Directory
have steadily mounted from the 560
copies sold on the ﬁrst day to a total
of approximately 750 copies sold to
date.

This year's directory combines
three new features. among which
are the insertion of academic and
social calendars and the use of ad-
vertisements through which the to-
tal cost of publication has been re-
duced by 25%.

Although a. superior grade of pa-
per has been used, the cost of print-
1113” was approximately the same as
last year. Since the cost of making
a new.cut was prohibitive, the rev-
er desxgn of the 1942 Directory was
not one submitted by the art depart-
ment as in previous years. This year
a more readily available cut was
used.

The Directory Board has advocat-
ed two alternative measures which
should be taken every year. These
are: the solicitation of advertising in
thespring of the year for the fol-
lowing fall in order that publication
may not be delayed, or the exclusion
of advertising entirely with a bud-
get appropriation supporting the
Directory.

Thompson Edits

Ocean Narrative

Mariner’s Autobiography
Includes Whaling, Gold

To the reader who loves to revel
in the pages of alluring sea stories,
“The Last of the Logan,” 5. story of
the true adventures of mariner
Robert Coffin, is the some of ad-
venture. With a full introductory
background by the editor, Harold
W. Thompson, former head of the
State College English department,
the chronicle of one of the most
amazing sagas of mariner life is
complete.

Robert Coffin scrupulously avoids
the supernatural, the fantastic, and
the flamboyant in depicting for the
reader a chronological survey of his
experiences from the time he be-
gan whaling in the Atlantic Ocean
to his gold searching days on the
continent of Australia.

The author, one of a line of illus—
trious sea captains, inaugurated his
career to obtain funds to further
his education rather than pursue
the life of a tiller of the soil as was
urged upon him, paradoxically
enough, by his relatives, a sea folk.
The taste of the salt spray turned
his ambitions.

Shipping as a regular hand on a
whaling schooner which was des-
tined to offer him more than several
exceptional adventures, this sailor
novice soon became a regular boat—
bred whaler and close friend of
many of the other men aboard ship.
A shipwrecked, perilous life among
the cannibals of the Fiji Islands, the
escape to Australia, and the gold
rush there tell in brief the story of a
career abounding in excitement and
downright enviable travels.

The style of the author is so sim-
ple that after reading the book, one
wonders what it was that so gripped
his interest. Coffin wrote the narra-
tive of his young life merely as a
personal account but Dr. Thompson
obtained this and started to publish
it. Several excerpts from his writ-
ings appeared and soon public de-
mand prompted printing of the
book.

State To Initiate
ContributionDrive

For Chest Funds

Greenberg, I43, I: Head
Of Charity Benefit Board

A college-wide drive for contribu-
tions to the ﬁrst State College Cam-
pus Chest is scheduled to begin
Monday. The funds obtained
through this campaign will be do-
nated to the charitable organiza-
tions which solicited the students
for money last year.

This drive will be instituted as a
result of the resolution passed in
assembly last week for the organiz-
ation of a Campus Chest. The
Board, headed by Solomon Green-
berg, '43, consists of the president of
Student Association, Ralph Tib—
betts. vice-president of Student As—
sociation, Don Vanas. and the pres-
idents of the following organiza-
tions: SCA, Kathryn Wilson; Men-
orah. Selma Leis; Epsilon Tau
Omega, Benson 'I‘ybring; and New-
man Club, Frederick Ferris. Miss
Sara T. DeLancy, Dean of Women
is the faculty supervisor.

Solicitors will collect the money
and will approach each student
through group houses instead of
through school organizations. Com-
muters will be reached by a special
committee. To facilitate the audit-
ing of books, the Student Board of
Finance requires that receipts be
given for all amounts of money col-
lected. Tags will be placed on stu-
dents so that they will not be ap-
proached twice.

“If every student contributes fifty
cents or more, this year’s quota of
$500 will be reach-
ed easily, Green-
berg explained.
Considering the '
number of organ-
izations aided by
the Chest, both
the student and
the charity will
beneﬁt. The stu-
dent will have to
contribute only
once during each
year and toe
charities will re—
ceive larger amounts of money than
formerly.

It has already been decided that
the charities who will beneﬁt this
year are the Red Cross, the World-
Wide Student Fund, the Albany
Community Chest, and the China
Relief. A floating fund of about
$50 will be maintained until some
charity, makes an appeal for aid.
The outlay of money in all cases will
be decided by the Board.

There will be three tables in the
Annex, Commons. and lower Hall
of Draper. respectively, for the col-
lection of money. At the central
table, a group 01' thermometers will
be set up to record the progress of
each group house and body of com-
muters. Onc main thermometer will
show the entire amount of money
contributed day by day.

This plan has proved successful
in many other colleges. Last year.
the average amount contributed by
each person in Union College was
$1.91.

Modeling Field Inveded
By Handsome State Men

Attention, girls! Here is a tip
on our State men! Six of our
bold, handsome men were called
down to a clothing ﬁrm to model
men's suits. Yes, men do model.

This group when called to do
their task hurriedly polished up
on their appearance, scampered
down to State street, and donned
the suits awaiting them. Click
of a camera—then it was all
over!

Take a peek at the Times
Union, where you will see these
six gentlemen in their snappy
tweeds and smooth covert.

Those who desire ﬁrst hand
information concerning the
proper technique of displaying
the manly torso in proper attire
may consult the following:
Fred Shoemaker, Joe Roulier,
Doc Cook, Fran Mullin, Harry
Archambault, and Al Meschter.

Robertshaw Hired
For Greek Ball

The ten piece orchestra of Butch
Robertshaw, a neweomer to State.
will be featured at the Interfrater-
nity Ball which will be held in the
Commons from 10 P. M. to 2 A. M.
December 13.

“Butch Robertshaw has the most
popular band in the capital dis-
trict,” stated William Matthews. ’42.
He is especially well known in the
Schenectady - Amsterdam vicinity.
“At present he is playing on Sun—
days at Mohawk Mills Where such
bands as Erskine Hawkins and Col—
man Hawkins have appeared,"
stated Harold Singer.

Robertshaw plays the drums and
specializes in swing but his sweet
music is very danceable. Among
other attractions are a male vocal—
ist and novelty numbers in which
Robertshaw, himself, takes the part
of a girl.

Plans to decorate the Commons
for the ball reveal that a box shaped
like a Chinese lantern will cover
the center light. streamers will run
from this to banner adorned walls.

Bids for Interfraternity Ball have
no deﬁnite price. When the cost 01'
the dance is determined each of the
four fraternities is assessed a cer-
tain percentage of cost based on
membership. A fraternity may pay
the assessment from the treasury
and admit its members free; it may
assess each member a certain
amount; or it may find out how
many members are going and di—
vide the cost among them.

 

Vending Machine
May Supply Milk
At Lower Rate

As a result of an investigation
at a local dairy, Student Council will
probably install a milk machine in
the near future, provided that the
cafeteria realizes the proﬁt from
the sales. Inquiry at the dairy re-
vealed that a machine which would
dispense milk at ﬁve cents a bottle
is available. Dr. John M. Sayles,
President of the College, is reported
in favor of the installation of such
a machine so long as Miss Thompson
will receive the proﬁt.

Group Meets Tuesday

Discussion of this project will be
the chief feature of the next stu-
dent-faculty discussion group meet—
ing on Tuesday at 4:30 in the
Lounge. Miss Laura Thompson.
Manager of the cafeteria, is ex—
pected to be present to comment on
the idea and to explain the rise
in milk price. A representative from
the Hygiene department may also
attend to comment on the effect of
the higher price of milk on the
health of Milne and State students.

Student Union was the ﬁrst topic
of discussion at the Tuesday meet-
ings. This assembly of the group
was successful from the standpoint
of results. At that time the feasi-
bility of a student union at State
was investigated, and further work
on the idea was left to the Mys-
kania committee, chairmaned by
A. Harry Passow.

Committee Awaits Replies

Letters have been sent out to
several colleges asking for informa-
tion on the aspects of student
unions. Questions about the ﬁnan-
cial and social angles were asked.
The committee is awaiting replies
to the letters. Five thousand dollars
is the sum estimated as necessary
to start a union. This price includes
furnishings.

All students are invited to attend
the next meeting of the discussion
group. The topic of milk and food
prices is a vital one to every person
at State College, and attendance
will result in a better understanding
of the situation. The idea of such
a group. as formulated by Myskanin,
is a pioneer venture between stu-
dents and faculty. To make this
more democratic innovation a suc-
cess. it is necessary for all students
to cooperate for its support.

Rusiics To Gamble On Turtles
Al The Coming Sports NighlL

The hicks and haysceds of State
College can really shake down the
rafters on December 12 at the annual
MAA-WAA Sports Night which will
be conducted like a country bazaar.
This theme was approved by Kay
Peterson, president of Women's
Athletic Association and William
Dickson, president of Men’s Athletic
Association. Jane Grccnmon and
Owen Bombard, juniors, co-chuir—
men of the Carnival, announced
that no tricks will be pulled on the
visiting farmers and all pickpockcts
will be publicly spanked.

The country bumpkins will
form a line at the
Commons" door
immediately after
the basketball
game with 0011— .
necticut State
Teachers College.
Each student will
pay the price
marked on the ‘
slip of paper that
is pulled from the
doorman's hat ; Kuhn-rm" rerun“...
the prices range from one to ten
cents.

 

 

Booths and concessions will ex-
tend around thc Commons and may
be patronized for a penny. The fol-
lows who thought that a shincr was
becoming to Harry Bora will have
a chance to rcdccoratc his profile at
the bull tossing booth. If any man
has become proficient in the art of
dart throwing, he, can display his
ability at the dart concession. May—
be you were the champion penny
pitcher of your town; if so. you can
step up to the penny pitching booth
to match your skill with the other
experts. it is possible to gain the
doubtful distinction of being lhc
windiest student in college at the
wind section. which will consist of
blowing plug—pong balls the length
of the table. For the gamblers
turtle racing will provide a long, if
not last, run for your money.

Every student will clutch his price
slip as he makes the rounds of the
booths because every time he wins at
one of them this slip will be punch-
ed. When the bazaar ends at mid-
night, the fcllow and girl whose
tickets have the most holes will be
rewarded. Prizes will also be given
to the runners-up.

formal rushing activities.

93 Freshman Girls
Invited To Parties

Of approximately 200 freshmen
girls only 93 received invitations to
the sorority rush parties due to
duplicate, triplicate. and quadrupli-
cate bidding, as well as intersorority
limitations, Jean Sears, ‘42, Presi-
dent of Intersorority Council, re-
vealed. With this in mind, the
sororities will begin the ﬁnal stage
of their rushing this week-end with
a buffet supper on Friday evening
from 6-9 P. M. and formal dinner
on Saturday evening from 7-11:30
P. M.

This duplication means that at
most less than half of the freshmen
women will join sororities this se-
mester. The number of freshmen
pledged has varied each year from
72 to 95. I

Since the sororities are each lun-
ited to ﬁfteen pledges. a maximum
of 105 women can be bid by the
seven sororities. As a result of the
limitation of pledges, girls who in
former years would have received
several invitations to the parties,
received only one because sororities
stopped to consider whether they
had any chance whatsoever with
that particular girl.

Preference slips will be issued to
the freshmen through the Dean of
Women’s office on Monday morn—

Policy Poll, Resolution
Considered By Forum

Discussions of the Student Opin-
ion Poll taken by the S'r/l'ru Col.l.lmh‘
NEWS lust chk and of bills now
before the Senate highlighted the
meeting of the Forum Tuesday af-
tcrnoon.

A resolution introduced by Betty
Bailey, '43, to the effect that Forum
oppose the bill now before the Senate
to increase by five million dollars
the fund for veterans was passed.

Among the various committees
now at work is one to establish a
college defense unit to cooperate
with the Albany defense unit, and
a committee to investigate ways to
cut down traffic on Washington
Avenue.

A committee to investigate char”.-
es of communism and racketeering
in labor unions and one to look hit;
the relations between Mexico and
the United States with particular
emphasis on the oil well controversy
were proposed.

Majority Approves Aid
To Oppressed Nations,-
73% Disapprove A.E.F.

Back I". D. R., but stay out of
war says State College. In the poll
conducted by the STATE: COLLEGE
News and Forum last Friday in
assembly, the majority of students
approved of all-out aid to the na-
tions resisting aggression, but 73%
say they want no American Expedi-
tionary Force. The poll was con-
ducted to determine the opinions of
the student body concerning the ad-
ministration’s foreign policy and na-
tional defense, and to discover how
well qualiﬁed the students are to
voice those opinions.

Not Prepared For War

Most of the students seem to feel
that the United States is not pre-
pared for war, 72% voting so. Al-
though 11% feel that the United
States is prepared, a rather large
percentage, 17%, are undecided as
to our preparedness.

While 85% of the student body
voted that the United States should
not enter the war today, 73% dis-
approved of an expeditionary force
to assist Britain and Russia. Why
the difference of 12%? Does the
word “today” inﬂuence the students,
further indicating the belief that
the country is not prepared?

Half of the student body has
faith in the allied forces, 50% be-
llevingr that they can be victorious
without another American Expedi~
tionary Force. However, a large
percentage, 33%,, are undecided.
Which way those 33% would throw
their votes is another question for
discussion.

Send Everything But Men

About 64% approve of all-out aid
to nations resisting aggression, but
less than half of that percentage,
23%, approve of an A.E.F. Send
them everything but men seems to
be the sentiment of State College.

The student body has always dis—
played somewhat anti-Roosevelt
tendencies; 53.6%. voting last year
as opposed to a third term for
President Roosevelt. This time,
however, only 26% are not in favor
of the administration’s policy of
all-out aid to the allies, which
seems to show that the majority
approve of Roosevelt's policies.

Although in the past our foreign
policy has included protection for
China against aggression, only 13%
feel that a war with Japan would
be to our best interests. 71% of
the students oppose a Japanese war
in comparison with the 85% oppos-
ing our entrance into the European
war.

The rise of prices has been seen
in our school, yet only 51% cared
to have the government regulate
wages as Well as prices. This can

State Historian to Talk
Before Pi Gamma Mu

Intcl'cstln'; points of New York
State will be discussed by Dr. Arthur
Pound, state historian, in a pro-
gram, sponsored by Pi Gamma Mu.
Wednesday, December 17. at 3:30
P. M., in Room 20.

During his talk, Dr. Pound will
display at least 100 slides showing
the historical spots of New York.
Everyone in the audience will ﬁnd
some place, building or persons of
particular interest to himself.

According to program director.
Edwin Holstein, '42, “Dr. Pound
hasn’t spoken here recently, but his
talk promises to be educational as
well as interesting. We should all
hear Dr. Pound and learn more of
the state we live in."
