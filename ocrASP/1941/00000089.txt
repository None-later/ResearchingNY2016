 CIarkson,-St. Lawrence

Purple and Gold Varsity Travels North for Opener;

State Squad Smooth: Offense in Final Practice Games

As Quintet Prepares for Two Consecutive Contests

The State College Eagles will open their 1941-42 basketball sche-

dule with a road trip this weekend. They left by bus this morning for
Potsdam where they will engage Clarkson Tech. From there they will

Journey on to the border town of
Canton to play St. Lawrence Uni-
versity on Saturn ly.

Clarkson‘s main hope lies in its
sophomore recruits. These boys fin-
ished their schedule as a freshman
team undefeated and should offset
the loss of veterans from last sea-
son’s varsity squad. The Eagles beat
the Technicians in their single en-
counter of the past year by a tight
42-39 score.

As for the St. Lawrence lads, they
have power to burn. They are fast
and aggressive and have plenty of
height. Four of the starting quin-
tet are six feet or over while there
are seven six-footers on the entire
squad. Bill Bartlett will be the vet-
eran to watch. Coach Burkman an-
nounces that Gordon Christie, Ber-
nard Wicke, Kent Faulkner and
Johnny Varsoke. a junior, will round
out the starting five. The Larrles
defeated State in their single game
last year by a twenty-point margin.
Large Larry Court

The huge St. Lawrence court iiay
give the State squad plenty of
trouble. but Coach Hatficld has
been conducting practice games on
large courts for the past week to
acclimate the boys to the type of
court they will have to use in Can-
ton.

The lads who are making the trip
north for State are: Hank Braunei‘.
Bill Dickson, Tom Feeney, Bob
Combs, Rich Young, Byron Benton,
Moose Gerber, Leo Griffin, Art Flax,
Bill Marsland, Bill Miller, Don De-
mick, and Bob Seifert. The starting
five will consist of: Brauner. Dick-
son, Feeney, Combs. and either
Young or Benton.

Eagles Lack Drive

According to Coach Hatfield Tues-
day's practice game showed the
Eagles to be weak on defense. espe-
cially in checking. The squad was
not very strong in scoring either,
and the ball-handling was ragged at
times. To quote the coach. “The
team is lacking in drive. We have a
potentially good ball club—if the
fellows will only pull together and
play ball." A final drill session to
iron out the team’s weak points was
held last night.

The squad finds itself much bet-
ter Situated for reserve strength,
even with the loss of Forrest and
Bayer. than it was last year. Coach
expects that the reserves will be
able to give the starting five at least
five minutes of rest in each half of
the game. He even entertains hope
of developing an entire second
quintet from the reserves, which he
may be able to alternate with the
first five,

Besides those entered in the

STATE COLLEGE NEVIS, FRIDAY, DECEMBER 8, 1941‘

“Eagles Will Begin Schedule

 

. \

 

GINNY

With all the enthusiastic res-
ponses that were shown to the
announcements of both bowling and
basketball, everyone thought these
contests would start off with a bang
this past week. And what happened?
Neither tourney got started!

Monday five girls showed up for
bowling, and Tuesday, two girls.
Yesterday was supposed to have
been the first day of inter-house
league playing. Only two houses had
notified Win Jones they were form-
ing teams—Newman Hall and Psi
Gamma. Two houses can’t make a
tournament. Basketball made out a
little better, since the fresh turned
out in great numbers all week; but
still no teams were organized.
Source of Difficulty

What was to blame? At the bot-
tom of it all was the Intersority
Council silence rule. The upperclass-
men stayed away because they
couldn't talk to the fresh, and the
fresh stayed away for the same
reason. The houses hesitated to
form teams knowing the inconven-
ience of playing the sports in si-
lence. Obviously, this implies that
nothing can get underway until
next Wednesday.

The ironic part of it all is that
the winter season had been moved
up a week to get in some extra time
before Christmas. This Week has
now been lost.

Girls—get together, form your
teams and let Win Jones and Kit
Herdinan know about it. Christmas
is going to come too soon and the
tournaments will hardly have start-
ed. Let’s goi
A Thought For The Day

In line with all the cooperation in
vogue between WAA and MAA
(what with bowling and Sports
Night and then Play Day in the
spring), how about the winner of
the WAA ping pong tournament
playing the winner of the MAA
tournament?

State's Chess Team
Wins First of Season

State's chessmen are once more
in the winning column due to their
win over the University of Connecti-
cut by a 4-1 score last Sunday. After
about 5”.- hours of play. Art Fox and
"Dutch" Erbsteln offered their op-
ponents draws since Jim Gillan, Roy
Sommers. and Clarence Oarr had
already downed their adversaries.

This match inaugurated competi-
tion with the University of Connec-
ticut since this was the first time
that. Connecticut had played State's
pawn-pushers. However, it was not
an Upper Hudson Valley Chess
Lcagtic match.

The clicss pluycrs appreciate the
use of the club room on the third
floor of Suylcs l-lnll given them by
Mr. Ilulgcr. This is u convenienca to
the men since they now have a
dcllnltc place In which to hold their
matches.

Orchids Go to Ruback
For Graoi’Sporismonship

One of the ﬁnest examples of
sportsmanship ever exhibited in
State's I-M basketball league
was displayed by Henry Ruback,
one of the College House boys,
in the CH-Sayles Hall game last
Tuesday.

Ruback was playing a stellar
game for dear old CH. His in-
spired performance had already
netted him five ﬁeld goals. Then
a terrible thought struck him.
Was he being fair? Was it
sportsmaniike to be so parti-
san? Clearly the answer was
"No!"

The ghastly mistake must be
remedied, but the question was,
“How?” Then, as a rather wild
Sayles Hall pass came toward
him, the answer struck him in
a ﬂash. Reaching up. he deftly
boosted the ball into the College
House basket for two Sayles
Hall points!

 

SL3 Takes Lead
In I-M League;
Potter, KB Win

Scoring two victories during the
past week, SLS took undisputed
possession of first place in the Intra-
mural Basketball League by a record
of four victories and no defeats.

'However, SLS's position is far
from safe as Kappa Beta and Potter
Club. both of which have yet to be
beaten, are jealously eyeing the
number one spot. KB is in second
place with three wins and EEP
follows with two victories.

Weaker Teams Improve

Outside of the battle for the top
rung, the most significant point of
this week's battles in the intra-
mural court loop is the steady im-
provement of the teams in the sec-
ond division. Thomas More, the
Ramblers and Sayles Hall have come
a long way since their first games
and can no longer be considered
set-ups for any of the league lead-
ers. Ample proof of this distribution
of the loop’s strength was the SL8-
Rambler contest which ﬁnally re-
sulted in a close 10-9 victory for the
Pierco Hall neighbors. Capel threw
in a two-point counter in the last
minute to lift the game from the
fire.

The Thomas More boys showed an
improved offense and ball handling
although they were swamped by
Potter Club as the State Streetcrs
ran up the highest score to date. 37

RAJ“.

Tonight the current edition of the
State College cage representatives
will take to” the floor at Potsdam
and establish themselves in the
season opener. Last season's victory
over this outfit does not have any
direct bearing on the possibilities
this year. However, once again we
say—we’re always optimistic!

Keep ’em Flying

The last few issues of the Sum
COLLEGE News Sports page have been
in the hands of the juniors in the
department. Instead of the usual
following of orders, the boys went
off on their own and decided that a
name would be appropriate for such
a renowned college quintet as the
State basketeers.

Having decided upon a name,
they took an immediate poll of the
entire sports departmenb—and both
of them voted in the affirmative.
The results now are that we have a
State College "Eagle" squadron fly-
ing about the various courts of the
state.

The boys swore faithfully, “So
help us, we did it in the name of na-
tional defense.”

But were they surprised when
they discovered that the name met
with instant approval.

Deacon’s Masterpiece

Speaking of naming the basket-
ball team, we iust learned an inter-
esting bit from Parson “Moose”
Gerber Deacon Dickson.

"Moose" said that the team might
better have been named the “Deac-
ons” because of the long sermons
delivered on bus trips.

In order to make long trips short-
er, the boys get together and form
a congregation with Deacons. Arch-
Bishops, Parsons—but no collection
plate.

One of the boys has to get tip and
very gravely deliver a sermon on
Ethics, Socratian, 01' Aristotlean
philosophy, and of course, Plato's
views on friendship.

State College Band

Plans for the day include a pep
rally Ill Assembly at 11:30 featur-
ing the State College Band undci'
the direction of Charlie Reynolds.
Let's hope that it at least measures
up to the rally held last year. It
ought to be well-backed by the en-
tire Student Association.

Frosh to Meet

make the short trip to Albany Aca-
demy tomorrow night.

NEA Discloses
Teacher Shortage

War Emergency Creates
Decrease in Teaching Ranks

From a recent survey conducted
by the National Education Associa-
tion in which 233 placement bureaus
in 34 states participated, it was not-
ed that a serious shortage of teach-
ers in the ﬁelds of industrial arts,
business, science, mathematics, phy-
sical education. home economies,
and music exists. Mr. Paul Bulger,
Director of the Student Employ—
ment Bureau, believes that because
of the shortage, placements in the
fields of mathematics, commerce,
and science, will be very high.

26 Math Majors Prepared

Statistics revealed by the SEE
show that 69 students Will be avail-
able in the commerce department
by September 1942. In addition to
this, the college expects to grnduulc
in Julie, 26 students majoring in
mathematics. of which 1] lich
science i‘or a minor. and 14 people
with science majors, ninc liuvin':
mathematics as a minor. Coupch
with two graduate students with
such combinations, a total of 60
students with either science or
mathematics majors and minors
will be sent into the field.

Adding to this Mr. BuchI' said,
“This is a comparatively low num-
ber compared to the number of calls
which we get for teachers in those
fields."

Draft Affects ’l‘ciichcrs

Factors producing such a loss in
the ranks of the teaching profcssion
are caused by drawing of Icochcrs
into the draft and by the high sul-
aries offered in defense industries.
This loss of personnel crculcs yu-
cancies in school systems and 11' con—
tinued may lowor certification rc-
quirements in order to maintain the
supply of teachers,

Conclusions drawn from lhc rc-
piles of bureaus from all ports of
the country show thcrc is fill ili'llli'
shortage of tcuchcrs in rural dis-
ti'lcts and small towns. and u luck
in the supply of I.l'll(‘ll('i‘.‘i in senior
