Max Reinhardt Scheduled
To Hold Rehearsal Feb. 25

Advanced and Elementary Dra-
matics students will have an oppor-
tunity to work under the tutelage
‘of a world famous producer when
Max Reinhardt appears at Page
Hall February 26, 1942. He has sign-
ed a contract with the Dramatics
and Arts Association to direct the
first rehearsal of a play while the
audience listens to his comments,
criticisms, and suggestions.

Before Mr. Reinhardt comes to
State College, the Austrian-born
director will submit a play to D and
A. The cast will then be chosen‘by
Miss Agnes Futterer, Assistant Pro-
fessor of English. Those Advanced
Dramatics students selected will
have no acting preparation other
than the learning of their parts
before Mr. Reinhardt arrives.

Veteran of Drama

Noted for his skill in working
with small theatrical groups, he is
a cosmopolitan veteran of the
drama. Mr. Reinhardt has been
actor, playwright, organizer of
actor-groups, theatre builder and
manager, and has worked in Ger
many, Austria, England and the
United States.
4 He ﬁrst acted in Salzburg, then
went to Vienna and Berlin where
he managed the Kleines Theatre.

After thirty-one years of touring,
founding, and managing theatres in
Europe, Mr. Reinhardt was exiled
from Germany. Since then. he has
lived in the United States. Founder
and director of Hollywood's Dra-
matic Workshop, the producer has
tutored and helped to develop such
actors and actresses as Marlene
Dietrich, Mickey Rooney, and Olivia
de Haviland.

Experiments in Productions

By experimentation with actor
grouping and with lighting in his
plays, Mr. Reinhardt has attempted
to renew the attraction of the the-
atre. His productions include "The

Miracle," “A Midsummer Night's
Dream," "Hamlet." and “Oedipus
Rex."

“We have attempted to brim,r
something novel to State." said
Elizabeth Simmons, '42. president of
the Dramatlcs and Arts Association.
“The major presentation of D and A
for the second semester will be more
than an ordinary lecture."

Admission will be by student tax.
Student and adult tickets will also
be sold.

time, the sororities will submit
to the Dean's office a list of the
freshmen they wish to bid in order
of preference. These two prefer-
ence lists are compared until the
desired quota is obtained. If the
sororities wish to bid less than ﬁf-
teen. the maximum number, they
can designate so on their prefer-
ence slips.

At 5 PM. Monday, the sorority
will know the names of their new
pledges. The freshmen discover on
Tuesday morning to what sorority
they belong and are pledged on
Tuesday evening. ending the silent
period which started last Friday
when invitations to the parties were
issued.

expenses of each sorority. Each so-
rority president will be present.

only be interpreted as a liberal
point of view.

State College students seem to
show a sympathetic feeling toward
labor; despite many newspaper arti-
cles recently criticizing labor strikes
in key defense industries, 31% voted
that strikes in defense industries
should not be outlawed by govern-
mental legislation.

In asking whether students should
be drafted during the course of the
college year, the result was a 92%
negative vote.

Three questions were devoted to
discovering how much time students
spend in becoming well informed.
Although 66% say they read the
newspapers daily, 54% say they de-
vote only a half-hour a day to the
task of keeping informed. 60%
feel that their opinions as Ameri-
cans do not differ widely from those
of the average citizen.

Others May Bid in Future

Of the 93 freshmen women who
received invitations to sorority par-
ties, 77 were pledged this week to
sororities.

This number compares with 80
pledges of last year when the rule of
15 pledges as the sorority maximum
was not in existence. A few of the
sororities bid less than the maximum
in order that they might bid again
next semester from the Class of
’45. They could bid less than the
maximum by specifying so on their
preference slips.

The freshmen women were pledged
Tuesday afternoon by their sorori-
ties, at which time the silent period
ended its ten day existence.

New Press Bureau Begun
To Keep Students Informed

No, the line doesn't form at
the right, or the left—it isn’t a
line at all—that mob you have
been seeing daily crowded in the
hall across from the Publications
Office. Every student has been
plowing through to the wall
to find out the latest war news
bulletins.

It's an innovation created by
the Sra’rs COLLEGE Naws—-a Nawa
Press Bureau, posting latest bul-
letins as they come in via radio.
“Professional listeners" spend
their free periods with ears
keyed to the radio, ready to rec-
ord latest news flashes. Hot off
the air waves, it is given to a
waiting State.

David Slavin, ’43, is originator
of the idea, and Judging by the
response State has given it, it's a
success, and should be a perma-
nent feature.

 

Bazaar IS Theme

For Sports Night

Admission to Be Decided
By Drawing Slip From Hat

A country bazaar is lined up for
tonight as MAA and WAA jointly
present their annual Sports Night
in the Commons. Because the bas-
ketball game with Connecticut State
Teachers College was played last
night, the carnival will now start
immediately after the freshmen
play the Albany Law School ﬁve.
Admission will be determined by
drawing a price slip from the door~
man's hat—no ticket will be more
than ten cents.

Jane Greenmun and Owen Bom-
bard, juniors, have planned plenty
of booths and concessions. The
booths may be patronized for only
one cent.

Since an unusually large attend-
ance is expected, it may be impas-
sible to furnish enough pennies for
all.

Bombard says. “Everybody is sure
to have a swell time because we
have planned so much variety in
entertainment.” The ball-toss-
ing booth offers Harry Born, ’43,
as a live target while turtle-racing
presents gambling opportunities.
The other activities include a dart
concession, penny pitching, bingo.
and ping-pong ball blowing. The cen-
ter of the Commons is to be clear
for dancing, and a coke concession
is to be operated.

Every time a student wins at any
of the concessions, his admission
ticket will be punched. When the
bazaar ends at midnight four prizes
will be awarded—two for the girls
and two for the boys.

 

Xmas Recess Begins Friday

Class will recess for the Christmas
vacation 11 A. M. Friday, the Regis-
trar's Office announced. There will
be no assembly. Classes will be re-
sumed January 5.

Aggression In Pacific Brings War

by Jeanette Shay

"We are intcrupting this program
to bring you an important news
broadcast. Word has reached us
that Japan is attacking an Ameri-
cun base at Pearl Harbor." Thus
the voice heard round the world an-
nounced the unexpected and start-
ling news to u Slate College whose
chief concern at the time was so-
rority bidding.

Sororities suddenly toppled from
their place of importance in the
lives of State College students. "I
heard about the attack right after
sorority meeting and realized how
petty seine oi’ the things we were
thinking about here are," replied
Madge Sinclair when asked to tell
how she reacted to the new.

It is the consensus of opinion of
State students that although back

in their minds they had been expect—
ing" war to come, sooner or later,
its sudden precipitation came as a
great shock. “You don't expect to
hear about things like that on Sun-
day afternoon." was one comment
overheard. "I was at a fraternity
meeting when the broadcast come,"
said Paul Merritt. "I thought Hol-
stein was crazy when he told us
about it.” “I was asleep," said Curl
Mitchell. "About five o'clock, Jim
Maloncy rushed in like a modern
Paul Revere, and shouted, ‘On to
Tokio."'

Confidence is high among State
students that the United states will
come through with flying colors.
Fred Ferris expressed his feelings
as follows: “War is a tragic thing
and Sherman was right when he
said ‘War is hell,’ but we're in it,
and we're in it to win."

 

 

Sayles Urges Total Cooperation
With Roosevelt For Defense}

 

 

FULL COOPERATION with the all-out defense program of President Roosevelt
(above right) - - "yes," urges Dr. John M. Sayles, President of State College (above
left). However, he advises all students to attend ﬁrst to the lab at hand.

 

 

Xmas Spirit Will Prevail
AfSCA Carol Sing Tuesday

A Yuletide atmosphere cre-
ated by a Christmas carol sing,
the Men of State, a brass quar—
tet, a violin solo, and chorus
singing will comprise SCA’s
holiday festivities Tuesday at
7:30 in the Lounge.

Lo How a Rose E’cr Bloom-
ing, by Praetorius, 0h Bethle-
hem, by Dickinson, and Oh Holy
Night by Adams, constitutes the
individual carol selections to be
sung by the SCA chorus under
the direction of Earle Snow, ’44.

 

Campus Chest Attains
High Mark in Campaign

Latest reports from the Campus
Chest drive for a mass charity con-
tribution from State College shows
that a total of $150 has been re-
ceived thus far, with each student
having contributed ﬁfty cents or
more. The collective drive seems to
have netted satisfactory results with
a minimum of work.

The amount collected from the
four groups set up for that purpose
is tabulated daily on thermometers
with a large central thermometer to
record the total contributions. The
four groups represent the men's
group houses, the women’s group
houses, the Albany commuters, and
the out-of-town commuters.

Solomon Greenbcrg, '43, chairman
of the Campus Chest Drivc, con-
siders the drive successful. and
urges the cooperation of all stu-
dents. Collections will be made
through Monday.

Home to State

Not many oi' us yet realize the full
significance 01‘ all that has happened
in the post Week. Bernard Perlman
declared, "We still don’t realize the
gravity oi‘ it. We think we can light
11 war and go on living as usual."

The girls think it's time for them
to net. Jenn Scars “hates to see that
the follows in the service have to put
their theories into practice. ” but she
believes that it is up to all of us to
do our part. June Southwick wish-
es she could enlist, but since she can
not, she declared. "I'm going to start
knitting for Uncle Sam—and I don’t
mean Great Britain II I"

When asked whether he thought
the seniors over twenty~one would
be called into the army, Dean Nelson
said, “They may eyen lower the draft
age to eighteen. This is no longer
a play proposition."

Fraternities Plan
Dance Tomorrow

State’s fraternities will collabor-
ate to present their seventh annual
Inter-fraternity Ball tomorrow in
the Commons from 10 P. M. to 2
A. M. The ball will be the first ac-
tual formal dance of the year.

The “bidless” system which prov-
ed to be successful last year will be
utilized again. The cost of the ball
will be apportioned among the fra-
ternities according to the number
of members in each. Three courses
are open to the fraternities in meet-
ing their respective obligations. Each
member may pay a speciﬁed
amount; the treasuries may supply
the cost; or it may be divided
among the members who attend.

A new orchestra, that of “Butch”
Robertshaw, is another feature of
the evening’s entertainment. Rob-
ertshaw, familiar to the capital dis-
trict, is now playing at Mohawk
Mills.

Decorations will be novel in that
a huge rectangular lantern, con-
taining the letters of the four fra-
ternities, will be suspended from the
ceiling. Streamers will be fastened
from the lanterns to the walls.

Several co-chairmen have been
appointed to head committees. They
are as follows: Arrangements, Max-
son Reeves. '42; Decorations, Les
Graves, '42; Refreshments, Baird
Poskanzer, '42; Music. Hal Singer,
’43; Programs, Bob Leonard, '43;
Clean-up Committees will consist of
the ‘45 pledges.

Chaperones for the dance will be
Dr. and Mrs. Donnal V. Smith and
Coach and Mrs. Elliott Hatﬁeld.

Maxson Reeves. President of In—
ter-fraternity Council, says “The
'41 Int'erfraternity Ball is NEW and
it's good!”

Choir to Present Carols
in Assembly Program

In keeping with the holiday spirit,
the College Choral Society under the
direction of Dr. T. Frederick H. Can-
dlyn. Assistant Professor of Music,
will present the annual Christmas
program in today's assembly. The
student body will be requested to
participate in the singing.

An estimation of the progress
made by the connnittee workers for
the Campus Chest Drive will be giv-
en after the conclusion of the sins—
ing and a resolution will be intro-
duced by Fred Ferris. ’42, for a Btu-
dent War Service Council.

There will be no assembly next
Friday.

War Service Progr V
Will Be Organized
As State Plans Aid" .r

"state College will cooperate to
the fullest extent with the nation in
the present war crisis,” said Dr.
John M. Sayles, President of the
College. in an interview this week.
A definite war service program will
be organized at State, to ﬁt in with
the all-out defense orders of Presi-
dent Roosevelt. Plans for service
were under way even before the
President’s radio address Tuesday
night. when he impressed'on the
nation the need for cooperation in
order to win the war and the peace
that will follow.

However. Dr. Sayles went on to
advise all students, to pursue first
their present job, that of eﬂectively
completing their educational pro-
gram. The President of the College
stressed the importance oi' patience
on the part of the student body.
Don’t Get Excited.

“Don’t get excited over rumors and
enemy propaganda,” advised Dr.
Sayles. “Tend to the job at hand.
and wait until some formulated pro-
gram of service has been inaugurat-
ed which will permit everyone to
contribute to the best adVantage."

Dr. Sayles agrees‘with President
Roosevelt that the war will be a long'
one. For this reason, he urges the
students to use their heads, since
there will be plenty of time to make
contributions. “This is no-time for
emotions to run away with sanity.
Nobility lies in the mind, not in the
blood."

Students to Co-operate

There is very little possibility for
the formation of an R.O.T.C. unit
at State College. ' The College will
cooperate with the Albany Defense
Council to the fullest extent. The
Red Cross has already been con-
tacted, and some plan of service will
be presented to the student body.

A resolution for the organization
of a Student War Service Council
will be presented in assembly this
morning by Fred Ferris, ’42, Presi-
dent of Forum. The resolution,.
formulated by Ferris and approved
by Forum Board, recognizes the
need for civilian cooperation with.
the government of the United States.
This Council will work hand in hand
with President Sayles.

Round Table to Discuss
Latest War Problems

A round table discussion of the
war will make up the program for
the next meeting of Forum Tuesday
at 3:30 in the Lounge. Speakers will
be Mary McCann. '43. Paul O'Leary.
Marion Sovik and Joseph Higgins.
sophomores, Edwin Holstein and:
Fred Ferris, seniors.

Questions from the ﬂoor will be
answered, and an endeavor made to-
ascertain the full economic, military
and political power of Japan. Events
of the war to date will be analyzed.
Two of the speakers are members of
Debate Varsity, following the plan
of Debate Council and Forum to
work together closely in the next.
few months since their programs are-
so much in accord.

A report from the Civilian Morale
Committee. chair-manned by Rita
Hickey, '43, will be a special feature
of the meeting. The committee will
report on the work done‘kin con-
tacting various defense agencies,
Tentative plans are being made to
form a unit to cooperate with
