We Shall Also Serve—

War in all its fury and recklesness sudden-
ly struck down upon the American people last
Sunday afternoon. True, war was inevitable,
but no one dreamed that active participation
would come so unexpectedly and so forcefully.

Across the vast expanses. of the Paciﬁc
Ocean, in Manila, at Pearl Harbor, at Guam,
at Midway, and at Wake Islands, American
men have already given their lives in defense
of their country. As the days and the weeks
stretch on, thousands more will undoubtedly
die or be maimed.

. While battles are being fought, we remain
here in an atmosphere, albeit not of tranquil-
lity, but of comparative calm. We are, how-
ever, willing and able to sacriﬁce also. In the
words of our great President: “It is not a
sacriﬁce . . . rather it is a privilege.” Our
beloved America stands today at its most
crucial hour in history. We must show that
we are willing to give of our time and energy
to see that the war effort is carried to a suc-
. cessful conclusion.

We who cannot directly participate on the
scenes of operation have a job to do. A Stu-
dent War Service Council will shortly begin to
function here in the college For most of us,
the work done for this Council will be our
meager contribution to the defense of the
realm.

For men, such tasks as driving an automo-
bile, giving blood, acting as air raid wardens,
ﬁre-precaution workers, etc., are offered. Wo-
men who can cook, knit, sew, make surgical
dressings, typewrite, speak, telephone, etc.,
will be needed. There are courses in nutrition,
nursing, ﬁrst aid, food conservation, agricul-
ture, auto mechanics, recreational leadership,
citizenship, communications, etc., which are
offered by the City Defense Council. The
women of the college might entertain service
men who are off duty. Of course, a great deal
of work must be done to gear the machinery
of the Council with that of the academic and
extra—class work of the college. But it can be
done.

Rooms in the college, the Commons, and the
Lounge may have to be used in connection
with the Council’s program. In short, normal
college life will be interrupted. The end in
this case justifies the means.

We must be prepared for countless hin-
drances and inconveniences. We must 'be
prepared to give to the utmost of our energies
and our resources.

No intangible or incomprehensible matter
if at stake. As the New York Times has
pIIrasPJ ii ,. “We go into battle in defense of
our own land, of our present and our future,
of all that we are and all that we still hope to.
be. of a Way of life which we have made for
corrosive: on free and independent soil. the
only way of life. which we believe to be worth
living."

 

Sitting, in her office, surrounded
by picture‘sof famous actors and an
aura of theatre, Miss Futterer said,
“I don’t knowvwh’at to say that’s
printable.” And added hastily, “I
mean that’s interesting!" Not only
as a never-failing source of quotes
forthe Haul-Soft column, is Miss
Futterer known to the student body,
but also as an interesting person.

The interv'ewer found herself lis-
tening intently for the nuances in
that quick clear voice, and watch-
ing those expressive hands so inter-
estedly that nothing important was
taken down.»

Keeps Students Fascinated

When a student body takes the
trouble to nick-name a professor,
it's an axiom that they like or dis-
like that professor violently. And is
there a student who doesn't watch
fascinated as “Aggie” Futterer
transforms the simplest action into
sheer drama? The walk to the front
of the auditorium (Lady Macbeth,
banquet scene), the amused smile
(Gertrude Lawrence, “Design for
Living"), the look, half reproachful,
half contemptuous, for the student
who sounds ever so faintly a flat A
(Katherine Hepburn, “Philadelphia
Story”).

It’s a safe conclusion that the
students don’t call her “Aggie” be-
cause they dislike her.

"Aggle" Distracts Reporter .

Oh yes, Miss Futterer did say
something about her family and her
new summer house (“I bought it
with twa friends—female, you’ll be
glad to know”) But just exactly
what she said has been forgotten in
the mood of the moment.

Somehow the interview turned
into a cross-examination of the
writer and a discussion of interna-
tional politics and the theatre.

Helmuth Schoen, State College
Grad, Class of '41, (brother of Honey
Schoen, '44) is another one of the
men in the army. After graduation
he was employed as a chemist in
the Agfa-Ansco plant at Bingham-
ton and liked the work, but early in
November he donned a uniform at
Camp Upton. Schoen says that it
was a beautiful spot on Long Island
“60 miles from nowhere in the mid-
dle of God's country.” Then he was
shipped to Ft. Belvoir, Virginia.

Army Food Plentiful

As this is where they train engin-
eers, Schoen was soon busy learning
rigging, and the construction of
roads, bridges, and anti tank ob-
stacles. He calls attention to the
fact that it is the engineering out-
fit that does all of the dirty work.
He enclosed a picture illustrating
this point which you will find post-
ed in the lower hall of Draper near
the men’s locker room. Helmuth
says the food is plentiful and that
if you eat it blindfolded you won't
mind a bit. He also adds, "If you
have ever had your dessert and
soup on one plate you know what I
mean." He closed with the request
for more letters from State College
students addressed to Helmuth
Schoen, Co. C, 5th Engineers Train-
ing Battalion, E.R.T.C., Ft. Bel-
voir, Va.

War Games Serious

The latest word I have received
from Gordy Rand indicates that he
is still a Private First Class at Ft.
Eustis. Va., but hopes to be trans-
ferred soon to Maxwell Field, Ala.
to enter the air force. From Bob
Margison (who has been promoted
to the rank of Sgt.) I hear that the
recent war games were taken very
seriously by the army and have
proven useful in reorganizing our
fighting forces.

 

Rebuttal to Mr. Takes

 

To the Editor:

In all respect to Mr. Takas’ col-
umn last week. I want to try to show
the actual situation in the fraternity
system existent at State College.
Except for a few broad generaliza-
tions, I feel unqualiﬁed to attack or
defend the sorority system.,

First of all, Mr. Takes speaks of
the plight of those students who are
not bid to the Greek-letter organiza-
tions. The fraternities have solved
this point. Since the existence of
our four fraternities. they have tak-
en an average of from 75% to 85%
of the men each year. For the past
two years they have taken about
90%.

He says that the exigencies of the
fraternal system may be condensed
into one word—loyalty. May I ask
what is wrong with loyalty? It has
meant more than any other thing to
me in my fraternal life.

I believe it is unjust to condemn
fraternal bodies for participating in
college politics —— unjust. because
such activity, in spite of the exist-
ence of Greek-letter groups. is en-
tirely within the realm of a human
being's normal tendencies. You find
exactly the same thing in a political
party or in any masonic body.

Contrary to most opinion at State
College, a fraternity does not always
support one candidate. although
such concentrated support is un-
doubtedly the wisest political course
to pursue. A careful check on last
year’s college elections will reveal a
number of cases in which more than
one candidate per fraternity ran for
an important office. Such a situa-
tion speaks for itself. I sincerely
believe that fraternities at State
College are learning more and more
that it is far better to lose an of-
fice rather than the good will of fra-
ternity brothers who wish to com-
pete for that same office. My whole
point. in summation. is that politics
are perfectly acceptable in a Greek-
letter group, but they should never
occupy a place of primary import-

ance.

"Where all think alike no one
thinks very much” is an apt phrase
of Walter Lippmann, which scarce~
ly represents fraternities at State
College at this time. I can say
very strongly this one very 1m ort-
ant thing e that during the hree
years that I have been a member.

Common

IEIH'

of my fraternity, not once have I
heard any of my brothers say: “You
think as the rest of us do or shut
up!" Neither have I had anyone
instruct me not to vote for an out-
sider who was running against one
of my fraternity brothers.

To contend that ridicule of other
fraternal organizations is non-exist-
ent at State would be foolish. I
don’t like it. Some of my fraternity
brothers have done it. At times I
have been guilty too. But such as-
persions on the character of oppon-
ents should not call for a condemna-
tion of the fraternity system, because
aspersions represent reactions which
are not peculiar alone to fraternity
men.

Of course. if I oppose all actions of
other fraternity men, then I might
be accused of having a “small fry"
mind. But I do not believe that is
the case. Stopping to realize, I
know that had I Joined the other
fraternity which I once considered,
my present outlook would be much
different from what it is now. Just
remember that if you had been born
in a family of different religion
from yours now, you would probably
be happy in that belief.

I admit that I am biased toward
my fraternity. I think they are the
best follows on the State College
Campus. But why shouldn't I think
that? I may be biased. but I refuse
to be intolerant of others. even if I
disagree with them.

Some of the best friends I have are
members of opposing organizations,
but they are going to remain my
friends. And as I look over the ma-
jority of fraternity men. I find very
few who stick exclusively to their
own group.

In closing. I want to congratulate
Mr. Takes for taking a crack at
that one phase of our fraternity set-
up that dates from the Dark Ages—-—
namely, intolerance and restriction
against certain religious creeds.

I have done my best to Justify the
existence of fraternities on the State
College Campus. My opinions here
represent individual views and
should not be construed as those of
any group with which I am affili-
ated. How about hearing from the
sorority women now?

14.7.

Monday is ordinarily a peaceful and a better than
average day for us. We get up early in the morning,
refreshed by Sunday's rest, and go to work. Finishing
at noon, we eat our lunch and then come to college
to attend our afternoon classes. It has developed into
a regular routine by now; it has become something
that we do semi-automatically every week. Last Mon-
day there was a break in the routine.

We got out of work a little late, so there was not
any time to eat lunch. Instead, we hurried out of the
department store in which we work, so that we might
get to college a little early. As we passed the radio
department, we noticed a crowd of men and women
standing quietly listening to a turned-up radio, and
the realization came to us that they were hearing a
more than ordinarily important session of Congress.

It was almost 12:25. We gave up thoughts of getting
to school and paused to listen to the speech that the
President of the United states was about to make to
the Congress. A commentator described the appear-
ance of the crowded House. He told of the entrance of
the President. Then, a little after 12:30, Franklin De-
lano Roosevelt began one of the briefest public utter-
ances that he has ever made.

When he started to speak, business in the store
ceased entirely. There was a crowd of more than a
hundred people standing intently
around the radio. As the President went
on, emotion visibly deepened in the
men and women who were listening.
One man smiled at little foolishly; one
woman wiped off a tear running down her check.

The speech progressed to the close that the whole
nation was waiting to hear: “I ask that the Congress
declare that sinca the unprovoked and dastardly at-

 

 

Spccch
Arouscs
Emotion

' tack by Japan on Sunday, December 7, 1941, a state

of war has existed between the United States and the
Japanese Empire."

The voice on the radio was silent. A shiver ran up
our spine, and a burning sensation came to our eyes.
The crowd lingered for a minute longer and then
everyone went back to his shopping.

We left the store and got on the bus to come to
college. The two men sitting in front of us were talk-
ing about the speech which they too had Just heard.
All over the bus overheard snatches indicated that the
war was the sole topic of conversation. When we
transferred in the downtown business district, it was
the same. No one spoke of anything but the war.

We reached the college at about 1:10 and entered
the Publications Office. The room was jammed. A
crowd greater than any in there before was listening
to a little radio which, perched on a
desk, was running full blast. Eager
voices conveyed the information that
during the twenty minutes we had
been riding from the store to State, the
Senate had passed the declaration of war unanimously
and had sent it to the House.

We took our lunch and began to eat it. At the same
time, a commentator was telling of the progress in
the House of Representatives of a resolution calling
a hundred and thirty million people to go to war. In
a matter of minutes—long before we had ﬁnished our
two sandwiches—it was over. The.United States had
declared war on Japan.

When the news was announced on the radio of the
passing of the declaration. pandemonium broke loose
in the Publications Office. Some American flags which
had somehow appeared were taken and hung up all
over the room. Groups of students stood arguing, dis-
cussing, cheering.

The clamor in the room subsided .as a band on the
radio played the National Anthem of the United States
of America, Everyone stood up, respectfully listening
to the notes that had suddenly come to mean so much
more. Over in one corner of the Statesman office, one
girl turned her head to the wall, and quietly began to
sob. The anthem ended. The special broadcast signed
off the air. The noise in the room rose to a gentle
hubbub. The students, looking at the clock on the
wall, picked up their books and left for their 1:35
classes.

The Un’tcd States of America was a nation at war.

Conquer State Squad;

Play Herc Next Week
by Gene Guarino

State Eagles lost a thrilling open-
ing home game last night to a ﬁght-

. ing Connecticut State team, 46-45.

The local squad started slowly and,
although tieing Connecticut several
times, trailed at the half, 29-21. They
spurted in the third period to draw
even and go ahead, 38-34. The
Eagles outplayed their opponents in
the fourth period and held the lead
until the ﬁnal ﬁfty seconds of play
when Coniin switched one through
the cords to give Connecticut the
game, 46-45. Captain Brauner’s work
under the backet, Dickson's floor
game, and Marsland’s defensive
play were outstanding.

Defeated at Potsdam

The State College Eagles lost
their opening game to Clarkson
Tech at Potsdam last Friday by a
49 to 35 score. Both teams played
aggressively but showed need for a
lot of polish. Neither team has yet
acquired an eye for the basket as it
is expected they will, later in the
season. State sank one out of every
four shots while the Engineers av-
eraged one for every three attempts.
The Eagles trailed by only two
points at halftime but hit a slump
in the ﬁnal period to allow the En-
gineers to forge ahead to victory.
Smith and Finnegan were high
scorers for Clarkson with fourteen
points each. Hank Brauner's twelve
points was high for State.

Lose To St. Lawrence

From Potsdam the Eagles went on
to Canton where they engaged the
St. Lawrence University quintet on
Saturday and lost, 39-27. Although
the Eagles did not have adequate
rest nor time to correct the errors

which Coach Hatﬁeld noticed in the,

Clarkson contest, the team faired
pretty well against the Larries.
Coach Burkman himself thinks that
the Larries are very strong this year
and was surprised that the score
was not higher.

State led in the ﬁrst few minutes
of play but dropped behind 17 to
14 at the half. As in the Clarkson
game, State’s opponents went ahead
in the second half. Johnny Var-
soke played brilliantly for the Lar-
ries in the second stanza, scoring
thirteen points, the same amount as
the entire State team was able to
tally. Both teams lost valuable
points on their foul shots, sinking
only sixteen out of thirty-one tries.

Return Games

The Eagles will get their chance
to avenge the loss to St. Lawrence
when the two teams meet on the
Page Hall court Wednesday evening.
With the Connecticut game under
their belts and plenty of practice
to iron out weak points, the squad
will be in prime form for the con—
test.

The team will have the disad-
vantage of meeting a second strong
team, Clarkson Tech, on the follow-
ing night. However. playing on their
home court and with an enthusias-
tic Statc audience spurring them on,
the Eagles may emerge victorious in
both contests.

Two Teams Tie
For League Lead

Lead by Ruback who scored 21
points, College House outscored Kap-
pa Beta to register an easy 34-15
victory. This loss dumped the Lake

leaving Potter Club and SLS tied
for the league lead.

Potter Club went to town in their
two other games as they romped to
impressive victories over KDR and
the Ramblers. The lads from State
St. piled up 47 points against 33 for
the Ramblers. Ed Reed topped all
individual scorers for a single game
by swishing 20 counters through the
hoop.

Displaying fine team work, fea-
tured by passing and cutting, EEP
bowled over the KDR outfit 48-24.
Clay Sprowis led the winner's at-
tack with '18 points, while Bombard
and Reed contributed nine points
apiece to their teams’ scores.

It was requested by the chairman

players he in the gym at the sched-
uled time. Cooperation is expected

Frosll Will Play
Albany Law Five

The fresh basketball quintet will
make its ﬁrst appearance in the Page
Hall gym tonight, clashing with a
strong Albany Law outﬁt. The Law
School squad boasts many former
college stars, including Will Fra-
ment.

Over at Albany Academy last Sat-
urday, the freshman hoopsters
wound up on the short end of a 3-1-
24 count. The game was marred by
frequent fouls, Fran Mullin leaving
early via the four foul route. The
frosh showed flashes of form, and
on the whole played their prep
school rivals on even terms.

The greatest weakness seemed to
be under the basket, Academy's Bill
Helmhold scoring most of his twen-
ty-one points on easy lay-ups. Aca-
demy also got the ball off the frosh
back-board a number of times, which
gave them control of the ball. .

The frosh were out in front for a
brief time, 7-6, on baskets by Hip-
pick, Tassonl and Privett. Academy
swung into action at this point, how-
ever. and with Helmbold running
wild, forged into a 20-11 lead at the
half. Art Olivet contributed eight
points to the cause, while Buck Hip-
pick and Bud Privett played good
all-around ball.
