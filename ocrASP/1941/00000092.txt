3 Popular Combination

The demand for commerce teach-
. ers" surpassed that for teachers of
any, other subject last year, accord-
ing to statistics revealed by the
Student Employment Bureau. Of
831 different calls for teachers re-
ceived during the past ﬁscal year,
nearly one-fourth of them were for
sconunercial teachers. Science, Eng-
lish, mathematics and social studies
were next in the order named.

Many schools needed students
who were qualiﬁed to teach two
subjects. Mathematics and science
proved to be the most popular com-
bination. English teachers who
could also take over libraries or so-
cial studies classes were called for
by many schools. French-Latin
teachers ranked low in preference
with a total of 17 calls.

Among less utilized combinations
of subjects, English-commerce, Eng-
lish-French - Latin, science - social
studies, Spanish-French teachers
were in general demand. The SEB
did not receive many calls for
teachers who would take only
French, Spanish, history or phy-
sical education classes. There were
no requests for German teachers
unless they could also teach Eng-
lis

h.

[Inst spring State College put 260
certified seniors on the educational
market. Of these, 46 had an Eng-
lish-social studies combination. Sec-
ond in line were those who could
teach either commerce or social
studies or both. French and Eng-
lish, mathematics and science,
English and commerce were three
other combinations chosen by the
class of '41.

Three Subjects Added
For Spring Semester

Three courses have been added to
the college catalog for the spring
semester of 1942, according to a
statement from the office of Dr.
Milton G. Nelson, Dean of the Col-
lege.

Dr. William H. Hartley, Professor
of Guidance, will teach Education
113, audio-visual aids in instruction, 2
hours, second semester. Only Sen-
iors and Graduate Students may

in room 250 on Mondays and Wed-
nesdays at 1:35 P. M.

Miss Ruth Hutchins, Instructor
of Art, will be in charge of Art 4,
a beginners course in general art.
This group will meet Monday and
Wednesday, 1:35 to 3:35. Students
interested should consult with Miss
Hutchins before completing pro-
gram cards for the spring semester.

Closes With No Casualties
Men! Don’t worry. Your dates

red this weekend. Women's
banner rivalry appears to be over
temporarily at least and no
casualties have been reported.

A few pioneering sophomores
discovered the 1945 banner in a
bass drum in Page Hall 'audi-
torium. Although the sophs
secretly tried to remove the ban-
ner, an observant member of ’45
discovered the intended plot.
Meanwhile sophomores rushed

A Myskania member quickly
snatched the prize from grasping

ended in a stalemate.

 

SEB Institutes
Job Interviews

"Personality and extra-curricular
activities run neck and neck with
high averages, as far as teacher
placement is concerned”, stated Miss

‘ Irene Semanek, Director of the SEB,

at an interview on job qualiﬁcations
this week. “That is why we have
instituted sessions with the jun-
iors and sophomores. We want to
make the entire school ‘extra-cur-
ricular' conscious.” Miss Semanek
has held job placement sessions with
juniors and sophomores at meetings
during the past tWO weeks.

Previously the SEB worked only
with the senior and graduate class-
es. However, realizing the import-
ance to the prospective teacher of
a “well-rounded” personality, the
directors of the bureau have started
working on the “under-graduate"
classes.

“In many smaller schools," stated
Miss Semanek, “teachers are chosen
not only for proficiency in French
or Latin, but also for their ability
to direct a play, or to coach a bas-
ketball game. That is one rea-
son why we of the SEB urge active
membership in at least one of the
school organizations for all those
students of NYSCT who have as-
pirations toward a ‘teachership'."
“Active membership," explained Miss
Semanek, “means rolling up your
sleeves and really accomplishing
something for the organization.”

Dr. Pound Will Speak

A Pi Gamma Mu discussion con-
cerning interesting points of New

state historian, will take place Wed-
nesday in Room 20, at 3:30 PM. Dr.
Pound will supplement the discus—
sion with slides illustrating the his—
toric scenes of this section.

Masculine Members of Faculty

May Answer Call to Arms

With the declaration of war, per-
haps the question uppermost in the
minds of State College students is:
How will the war affect us? Not
only is it important to the students
but to the faculty as well.

The faculty members who will be
affected by the war are those whose
professional services may be needed.
those who are reserve officers, and
those who are registered under the
Selective Service Act.

In the World War I, Dr. Clarence
F. Hale, Professor of Physics, was
called from State College to do work
of liquid air and welding. Some of
our faculty may be called in much
the same way.

Early last Spring, the members of
technical societies registered in the
Roster for Scientific Personnel, 9. list
of the trained men in the country
who could be called upon in an emer-
gency. Dr. Thomas Kinsella, Super-
visor of Commerce in Milne, is the
ﬁrst to be called. He is now await-
ing orders which will take him to

Zilles, Clark to Present
Two Dramas Tuesday

Advanced Dramatics students,
Luke Zilles and Barbara Clark, jun-
iors, will present two one act plays
Tuesday evening at 8:30 P.M. in the
Page Hall auditorium.

The play directed by Mr. Zilles
is a fantasy with a small park in
London as its setting. Two rather
citiﬂed fauns, Betty Clough, ’45, and
Dora Aungst, ’44, are comparing
their present urban existence with
the idylic life they once knew in the
woods. The sudden appearance of
a man and a cockney flower girl
whom he has just defended in a
London pub brings an unexpected
twist to the plot.

Miss Clark’s play is a French
melodrama concerning a governess
(Claire Schwartz, ‘45) who has just
been acquitted of strangling a child.
Unconvinced of her innocence, a
doctor (Ira Freedman, ’43) sets
about to disprove the justice of the
court’s decision.

Washington as 9. Consulting Eco-
nomist.

Also as part. of this organization,
Dr. Henry L. sisk, Instructor in Edu-
cation, has been doing research work
at Albany Medical School for three
months on problems related to war
neurosis.

Dr. Charles Andrews, Instructor in
Physics, and Dr. Oscar Lani’ord,
Professor of Chemistry, are reserve
officers but do not know where they
stand, when or if they shall be called.

Dr. Robert Rienow, Assistant Pro-
fessor of Social Studies, Dr. Louis
C. Jones and Dr. Varley Lang, In-
structors in English, and Mr. Koo-
man Boycheff, Instructor in Physical
Education in Milne. are of draft age
but have been deferred to Class 3
because of dependents.

In relation to the war itself, Dr.
Donnal V. Smith, Professor of Social
Studies says, “I am merely a teacher
which is exactly what you students
are. And it is our duty in this time
of greatest crisis to do our work as
well as we can."

Com Club Plans Get-Together

Commerce students are invited to
attend a “Student-Faculty Get-To-
gether” Monday from 7:30 P.M. to
10:30 P. M. in the Lounge. Sadye
Zilin, ’42, chairman of the event,
promises games, entertainment, and
refreshments galore. The party is
an opportunity to become better ac-
quainted with the “profs.”

Sayles Extends Greetings
To State College Students

To the student body of State
College, Dr. John M. Sayles,
President, extends a personal
greeting at the season for cus-
tomary good will and rejoicing.
His complete message is as fol-
lows:

“The Christmas message,
‘Peace no Earth,’ has a very dif-
ferent meaning to us with the
dark clouds of war surrounding
us. However, let us determine to
bring it about by assuming
cheerfully the burdens which are
cast upon us. Let us exemplify
it by our present living, let us
create a new world of ‘Peace on
earth, good will toward men’ ——
good will which embodies toler-
ance, good will which recognizes
the rights of others, good will
which makes possible the growth
of people as well as nations in
religious freedom.”

. John M. Sayles,

President.

 

Debaters, Forum
Merge Activities

Debate Council has cancelled all
intercollegiate debates for the pres—
ent and is temporarily merging with
Forum to discuss world problems.

The scheduled debates were neces-
sarily cancelled because the topic
chosen by the National Association
of Teachers of Speech, “Resolved,
That the Federal Government
Should Regulate by Law All Labor
Unions in the United States——Con-
stitutionaiity Conceded,” is antedat-
ed. Seminars have been discontinued
for the time being and both fresh-
men and varsity debaters are at-
tending Forum meetings instead,
Since the Forum at the present time
is making a study of the Japanese
situation, and since Debate Coun-
cil feels that the only logical ques-
tion to discuss at the present time
is the Japanese situation, they are
cooperating.

Ira J. lesh, '42, President of De-
bale Council, does not believe that
another national topic will be chos-
en for some time. “I do believe,
however," said Hirsh, “that inter-
collegiate discussions havc two items

Possibility ot 5c Milk Remote-—
Myskania Will Review Problem

The proapect of 5c milk seems re-
mote today, as the problem has been
tossed by Dr. John M. Sayles, Pres-
ident of the College, squarely back
into the laps of the Myskania inves-
tigating committee. This committee
is to investigate the possibility of
the installation of a milk dispensing
machine as the solution to the prob-
lem of the rise in the price of milk
from 5c a half-pint to 7c.

The rise in the Annex prices was
the subject of the Student-Faculty
Discussion Group which met Tues-
day. Miss Laura Thompson, Man-
ager of the Cafeteria and Annex,
Myskania, honorary campus leader-
ship society, and members of the
faculty and administration were
present to hear opinions viewed. Dr.
Sayles presided.

Miss Thompson spoke in defense
of the rise in prices by remarking
that the operating expenses and the
rise in the cost of food of both
cafeteria and annex required her to
make up her loss by raising the
price of milk.

The solution to the milk problem
as offered by the Myskania commit-
tee would be the installation of a
milk dispensing machine which
could provide milk for be.

Whether or not the machine could
dispense milk efficiently and whe-

 

ther it could dispense both chocolate
and white milk at the same time
were the questions discussed. Miss
Thompson said that there had been
much mechanical trouble with the
former dispensing machine. Also a
machine can hold only 100 bottles
of milk, while Miss Thompson sells
on the average of 300 bottles during
the noon hour. This would mean
refilling the machine three times in
the space of two hours.

Another solution to the problem
suggested would be the lowering of
milk back to its former 5c price and
raising the prices on luxuries. What
those other luxuries would be was
not decided at the meeting but the
possibility was given to Myskania to
investigate.

Since the rise in milk prices, Miss
Thompson estimates that she sells
1/3 less milk now than formerly.

H o w e v e r, inasmuch as Miss
Thompson estimates that there is a
1 1/2c handling charge attached to
each bottle of milk, it seemed evi-
dent to some members of the discus-
sion group that if a dispensing
machine could be kept in good me-
chanical order, Miss Thompson
would realize as much profit from
the sale of milk through the dis-
pensing machine as she now ob-
tains.

 

Students Donate S330
In Campus Chest Drive

Many Promise to Contribute
Following Christmas Vacation

Solomon Grecnberg, '43, chairman
of the Campus Chest Drive, declared
in a statement to the S’l‘A’l‘i’i Contact:
News, that $330 has been collected
in student contributions.

“Although this has been an experi-
mental year for this new charitable
organization, the results of the cam-
paign thus for have been satisfactoy.
The present war may have its ef-
fects on this program; they may be
either advantageous or otherwise."

At the present time, the total sum
collected amounts to $330; many stu-
dents who havc been unable to make
any contributions to this charity
drive to date have promised to do so
after the Xmas vacation.

Since the data which has been
handled is insufficient for determin-
ing dcflntc ﬁgures in regard to the
percentage of the student body who
have paid, a more completed re-
port will be given by the committee
after the Christmas vacation.

The students who have not been
upprouched by the solicitors are
asked to make their donntions at
the table in the lower hull of Dru-
per.

Dr. Nelson Buys Flashlight—
Sheds Light on Subject

When the sound of the black-

will run to the nearest sofa and
twiddle their thumbs until the
all-clear signal blows. Confusion
will reign supreme among all as
they gropc along by familiar
landmarks.

But Dean Nelson will know
just what he's doing. The other
day he purchased a red-colored
flashlight to use in case of
blackouts. "I've always had a
black-colored one and I never
could find it when I needed it.
So when I saw this red one in a
store window. I bought it,” he
said. The Dean hopes this will
shed some light on the subject.

 

Juniors Formulate Plans

For Annual Weekend

Plans for the 1942 Junior Week-
end. February 20-21, are already un-
derway. This year the prom is to
carry through a plantation theme.
The class plans to engage a negro
orchestra to fit in with the southern
scene.

One event of the week-end pro-
gram, the ten dance, is to be abol-
ished this your, due to luck of in-
terest. Some of the money saved
is to be used to get a good name
bund. Since the orchestra agency
has not yet been appointed by stu—
dent council, thc class itself will hire
the orchestra.

Mildred Muttice. Vice-president of
the class, is n‘cnel'ul chairman. The
heads of the committees for the
prom are: Music, Howard Lynch;
Decorations. Jenn Buckinun and
Owen Bomburd; Arrangements,
Gloria Conunoruta; Publicity, Mary

‘DeLaney Outlines Program  I
For Student Wbr Service

State College began its War Ber? I V I

vice drive this week with the pre-
liminary registration of students
and faculty for classes covering all
phases of defense work. There was
a great response to the request for
war service workers, although the
number registered has not been cal-
culated as yet. Classes will be ar-
ranged to ﬁt in with the second se-
mester schedules of the students,
Miss Sara Tod Delaney, Dean of Wo-
men, explained. Class hours will be
posted outside Room 107, college war
center, as soon as decided.

Committee Set Up

A central committee has been set
up which will be in complete charge
of war and defense work on the
campus and will assign jobs to the
students. The committee includes
Miss DeLancy, Joan Sears and Bar-
nard Perlman, seniors, in charge of
organization of the service program
and setting up of classes; Dr. Robert
Rienow, Assistant Professor of Social ,
Studies, and Edwin J. Holstein, ’41,
Publicity; Mrs. Anna Barsam, in-
structor in Home Economics, and
Emily Blasiar, '43, knitting and sew-
ing. In addition to the central com-
mittee, Alice Packer, ’42, will work
on the knitting and sewing course,
and Miss Grace Martin, Miss Ruth
Suhrie and Miss Ruth Hutchins, of .
the Art Department will handle pos-
ter work.

A new course has been added to
the ones already planned. As his
contribution to the program, Dr.
Howard A. DoBell, Professor of
Mathematics, will conduct a course
in Machine Shop Theory and Prac-
tice. His course will give the rudi-
mentary procedures of shop work.

Many Courses Offered

Among the courses offered, the
Nutrition and Group Feeding course
is open only to women and the Big-
nal and Communications and Air-
Raid Warden Duty courses open to
men only. Open to both men and
women are the First Aid, Motor Me-
chanics and Home Nursing courses,
and office, knitting, sewing and pub-
licity work. Men must be at least
21 years of age to take the Air-Raid
Warden course. Three courses in
Motor Mechanics will be given: a
three week course, a twenty week
course and a ten week course.

Students wishing to help in some
way but who lack particular skill
may be useful in making posters or
assisting in either the Red Cross
or the college office.

The present program has been set
up in the light of needs apparent
now. Miss DeLuney said that the
progruni would be kept flexible to
provide for possible emergencies and
additional services required.

Finance Board Decides
Tax Reiund Standard

Because of an increased number
or students who, upon leaving school
this your, requested the refunding
of their school tax money, Finance
Bonrd deemed it necessary in set a
stundurd for the judgment of fu-
ture indivlduul cases. On Wednes-
day noon, u by—luw was passed and
udded to the Flnunco Board Consti-
tution. This provides that students
leaving college after the first month
of the first semester forfeit half
their tux. Students leaving dur-
ing the first month of the second
semester may upon application to
Finance Board, be refunded halt the
tax. Any withdrawals after the
first month of the second semester
will necessitate a forfeiture of the
entire tax.

Although such cases have arisen
every year. an increased number of
students have left collage this
semester due to the draft and avail!
able positions in defense work.
