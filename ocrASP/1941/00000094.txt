STATE COLLEGE NEWS, FRIDAY, DECEMBER 19, 1941

Sorority Sister Speaks

r

 

To the Editor:

Glen Walrath asked for a reply
to Mr. Takas’ column on fraternities
and sororities from one of the girls
and the temptation to answer was
too strong to resist.

Mr. Takas is right. I believe. on
the religious question. When I ﬁn—
ally came to a decision. the question
of religious prejudice was one of the
deciding factors in my choice. I
think such restrictions are wrong,
but understandable. People will al-
ways tend to gather in groups with
the same back-ground and thoughts.

Whether there were sororities or
not in state. there would be factions
and cliques. In so large a student
body. it would be impossible to have
one large happy family. Sororities
are the answer to the average per—
son's urge to associate with people
whom he likes or wants to know
better. Also they ﬁll a most impor-
tant part in the social life of State.

True. many students are never
bid. That is regrettable. Many. of
course. cannot join sororities be-
cause of ﬁnancial reasons. But I
ﬁrmly believe that there is no girl
who could not join a sorority if she
really wished to do so. A few looks
at a book on personality development
or even on dressing correctly. though
that's not too important. and any
girl could work wonders. But it's
too easy just not to try. and then to
criticize the sorority system. I‘m
being unfair. of course. because
many wonderful girls never have
had an opportunity to be rushed be-
cause they must work very hard.

And there‘s another important
consideration. Sororiiics cannot suc-

. ..
sOﬂ'lﬂ'lumqu-

cessfully function with too large it
membership. There should be mFIT’e
sororities on campus. and then every
girl who wanted to join one would
be taken care of. At least. that's my
opinion.

Of course. one usually votes for
a sorority sister at; an election. I
joined my sorority. because I liked
the girls in it. and I like them enough
to vote for them. That wouldn't stop
me from voting for another girl I
felt to be more capable. Certainly
I've never been told. nor heard any—
one told, to vote for one of the mem-
bers. I think that the sorority spirit
is a wonderful thing. The last thing
I would criticize would be loyalty or
affection. I’m bound to my “sisters”
by genuine respect and liking, not
by iron chains.

As for prejudice against other
sororities. I can only speak for my-
self. My theory is this—a girl joins
a certain group because she feels
most at home there. I respect her
decision. and expect her to respect
mine. I can think of only one girl
in school I honestly dislike and she
isn’t in a sorority. Each sorority. as
a group. is pretty swell. I think. Each
brings companionship and happiness
to most of its members and thus
fulﬁlls its purposes.

I don't think sororities are any
more undemocratic than a Women's
Club or the Elks. I‘ve written this
answer because I think the sororities
have taken too much criticism. with-
out cnough attention being paid to
their virtues. I hope I've stated the
case clearly enough.

Speaking of flowers. ilic December

The conventional shoulder corsagc

now iavor wrist or waist corsagcs.

over ilic old use of the flora.

Jewelry is. us always. important
for cvcning wear. Avoid an over-

much glitter will merely confuse ihc
observer. Instead. spot light a few
good pieces of costume ,iewchy.
.lcwclry usually goes hand hi hand

Santa Claus Gets
A Christmas Letter

 

 

,4. 7.

Dear Santa Claus.

It may seem a little foolish to you to have a college
student writing you a letter. People who go to college
are suppOSed to be old enough to have stopped be-
licving that you exist. So it is—we know you to be
just a product of the imagination. We long ago
stopped believing in you. Still. we are writing you
a letter.

You must realize. Santa. that this is just a whimsy
on our part. We are scrious so much of the time,
that every so often we feel like acting as if We were
still capable of believing in someone like you. And
when we really think about it. we must admit that
when we thought you were real. we were a lot happier
than we are now.

When we were children. Santa Claus. we knew that
you were a kind-hearted man who lived at the North
Pole. and no one could tell us differently. We knew
that once a year all good children could write you a
letter asking you for the things they wanted most.
Above all. we knew that they were never disappointed.

Whenever we asked you for something. we got it,
and if we didn't. we knew it was because we weren’t
good enough to deserve it. You always came through.

Santa. and we got. into the habit of de-

 

sanla pending on you year after year. You lived
Never up to the faith we had in you. You never
Fails let us down.

Well. here we are, writing you one more
letter to ask you to give us a few more things. It's a
little different, this time. though. We know that we
haven't been good at all. and that we don't deserve
anything: we know that you can't give us the things
for which we ask. Just the same. you‘ve never failed
us before. and it makes us feel a little better to write
to someone on whom we know we Ian dcpend.

We suppose that. it is right. for us to ask for the most
important things first. A little less than two weeks
ago. our country entered a world—widc war. We havcn't.
been in it Very long. and we haven't sui'fcrcd very
much yet, Still. we arc at war. and we don't like the
feeling we get when we think of it. Santa. the best
thing that you could give us is a quick peace. We
would prefer that no one had to die on (*iihcr side.
but since we know iliat is impossible. lt'l whatever is
to happen bc ovcr with quickly. l‘cacc ihai is a gift
that you can give not only us. but the whole world.

l'lycn though ihcrc is a war. we‘rc still going to
classes. Sunni. 'lhiii brings up somciliing clsc for
which we would likc to ask Egood marks. \Vc arc not
so silly as to thick that you can give them to us with-
oiii our doing anything Ior iliciii. biii we do wish
ihai you would givc us some motivation. We are told
that one must have ii to do good work. If we wcre
motivated. maybe we would do some studying. If we

siudicd. maybe or would get some good

Request marks. We need moiivuiion. Won‘t you
Fume givc us mine no one else will.
Fate Now wc‘rc going to get serious again and

ask you for something that seems very
unpori‘inl to us a kiiowlcdgH of the future. You can
scc why we vant ll. l'Iy‘t‘l'ylllllit’. that we do here is
so uncertain. We don't ki‘ow whether we shall get
jobs wncn \ic ai‘“ graduaicd. or whether we shall
go into the army. or whclhcr we shall get married. or
\ylicihcr we shall just sit waiting for something to
happen. li's I'ailicr dilticiili to kccp on with your
slittilys whcn you how no idca as io why you‘re doing
Ii all. or what you \llll have \vhcn you arc finished.
l‘lslit't‘lulll' so Is llllr. iruc lll these troubled times.
'lhcrcforc, .‘-.n;ia. plczisc give us an inkling of what.
