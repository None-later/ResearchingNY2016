From Fox Trot to Feed Bag

It’s Fun on the Farm

Syracuse University’s three Byrne brothers, Charles, Matthew and William, all
members of different fraternities, decided to have a barn party for their fraternities
and girl friends. When noses were counted it was not surprising to find some 300
Syracuse students had ﬂocked to the barn. They came dressed in dungarees, hunt-
ing clothes, sweaters and sneakers, danced old fashioned square dances, the Vir-
ginia Reel and all the others, along with today’s Congo and iive. Of course they

had cider and doughnuts, and of course they had a good time — as these pictures

Bull sessions and storytelling took place around the stove. This was a favorite spot
as the weather was crisp. Host Matt Byrne, Jr., listens at left.

Tlic raid’s tlic thing. nowadays
at SGT—or at least the Albany Po-

So. Policc Chief William J. Fitz-
patrick aniiounccd a list of do‘s and
don'ts last week to bc followcd by
State wayi‘arcrs at the sound of tlic
vacillating “air raid“ sircns. Maid or
man who rcfuscs to hccd directions
may cause a boom in thc undertak—
ing busincss.

As soon as thc “lurrin divils" wing
into sight. their numbcr is taken by
tlic Army Filter Station which ini-
nicdiatcly passes on the word to the
Police Dcpartmcnt which, in turn.
kccps up the chain by rclaying the
news to the Fire Dcpartmcnt. ’I‘licn.
cvcry cruising patrol car will aban—
don its role of pick—up for that of a
blaring Mercury; and tirc trucks.
owlislily inclincd hcrctoforc, will add
tlicii' car—splitting activity to the
gcncral confusion.

it's a rcpcatcd long and short. blast
that mcans "Duck or disintcgi'atc!"

ing you of a coming storm (not the
damp typcb: and take shelter
“whcrcsocvcr you may find it."
Don't hcsitatc to crawl into the near-
cst man-hole, cellar window. or iron
minc. Aftcr all. “pride comes before
a fall lot a bombi.” If you're in the
process of descending the steps of
Drapcr. you are advised to return to
the realms of Minerva. until the air
is cleared. Ai’tcr all, even the at-
mosphci'c of cut and dried stooginess
is bcttcr than that of cutting steel.
If you value your continued exist-
cnce. ﬁnd some more t?) work to
do in the library.

And dormitory rules hold for air
raids. too—no man is to appear above
the first ﬂoor of a building or at.
the windows. But, strange as it may
seem. basement rooms—the darker,

safety for all.

And if you're not one of those
