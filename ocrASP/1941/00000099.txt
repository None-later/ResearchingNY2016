an... Club, SLS

Prove Fraternity

Houses Informal

Fellows Drink Much Milk
As Glenn Miller Rates Al

Life goes on in a slightly different
way in State's four fraternity houses.
The idiosyncracies of living at Kappa
Delta Rho and Kappa Beta were dis-
cussed in a previous issue; now
angles of life at Potter Club and
SLS will be di-sected.

Six dollars and ﬁfteen cents per
week is the price charged by Potter
club to each of the sixteen fellows
living at 495 State Street. Every
person in the house has a job to
perform. The boys do their own
cooking, which is limited to one
meal a day. Breakfast and lunch
are eaten elsewhere. Edward Burke,
’42, is house manager. and Bob Sei-
fert, ’42, house president. Burke re-
ceives his board and room in return
for the services he renders.

A typical meal at Potter Club is
very satisfying. Tomato and lettuce
salad, lamb chops, mashed potatoes,
spinach (Ahll, milk and fruit jello
is a good example of a Potter Club
supper menu. Six loaves of bread
are bought each day to suit one
George Miller’s appetite.

Potter Club Musical

Potter Club is deﬁnitely musical.
Six men play the piano, and Harley
Dingman, ’43, can play nearly every
instrument made. Impromptu sings
are high spots of life at Potter. The
vic operates continuously and Glenn
Miller time is always obser'Ved.

The EEP boys have abandoned the
practice of playing basketball in the
kitchen with the soup bowl. resort-
ing to football. basketball and base-
ball games in Washington Park ac—
cording to the seasons.

FLASH! Everyone at Potter Club
gets up five minutes after his first
class!

Board and room at Sigma Lambda
Sigma is eight dollars per week.
Thirteen dollars per week is paid
out to boys working at the house.
House manager Thorpe DeVoid. ’42,
gives out jobs on the basis of need.
Like other managers, DeVoid re—
ceives board and room for his work.

“Excellent food” says Eugene
Guarino. '43. and proceeded to list
a typical meal served at 203 Ontario
Street. An entree usually precedes
such items as pear salad, pork chops,
sweet potatoes, corn. applesauce, and
pudding. A quart of milk per day is
allotted to each man. and the fifteen
fellows living at SLS manage to
take care of the milk situation ade-
quately.

SLS Enjoys Bridge

The dormitory system is used at
SLS. The studies on second floor
are largely doubles, with the excep-
tion of the large front room which
houses three people, and one study
which is a single. The house man-
ager's study is on the first floor.

The Ontario Street boys are bridge
flcnds and have lately taken up
Russian Bank. A dnrt board is part
of the recreational equipment. A
favorite practice at SLS is n (5 A. M.
jam session. featuring singing. piano
and victroln. With such musicians
as Kunz, Reeves, Snow and Mill'-
shnll, the popularity of singing is
understnndnble.

This follows enjoy listening to the
“inner Sanctum" myslery progrnm.
Dl'lillll.(' quiet hours exist. but since
rushing is over. they will now be
enforced.

And that‘s how the masculine
Greeks spend their time nwny from
the lvit-d walls of NYSC'l‘.

Women Prove Martyrs—

Christmos Carols Lock Boss

Can State women get along
without men? Sorority women
had the opportunity to display
their somewhat dubious inde-
pendence last night at their an-
nual Christmas parties.

At midnight last night the so-
rority cinderellas bid adieux to
their dates under clusters of
mistletoe. some of the less subtle
wearing them in their hair.
Hereupon they clenched their
lists preparing to face the su-
preme test—the “hen party."

First they exchanged such in-
expensive gifts as lipsticks ——
things with which only women
are bothered. Christmas carols
were then sung without the ac-
companiment of resounding bass
voices. At the completion of
festivities, sororities cared little
that State lacks men. Their
theme song is I Get Along
Without You Very Well. but
they added the sequel Once In
A While.

 

Departmental Clubs
Use Xmas Themes

Slides, Faculty Discussions
Given At Verious Meetings

Christmas themes provided ma-
terial for meetings of the various
departmental clubs last week. The
Math Club has made plans for its
next meeting which will be held
after vacation.

Ellen Holly and Margaret Hollin-
ger will present two topics at the
next meeting of the mathematics
club to be held January 6. at 7:30
o‘clock. One of these will be “Mak-
ing Pi Digestible.” It is expected
that the meeting will be held in room
101.

At the last meeting of the Classi-
cal Club on December twelfth. the
members sang Christmas songs in
Latin and engaged in a discussion
of Saturnalia and its relation to our
Christmas.

The French and Pan Amigos 01'-
ganizations held a joint session last
Wednesday in the. lounge. At this
time Dr. Watt Stewart delivered a
speech on South America. He em-
phasized Christmas in that country
and punctuated his talk with various
slides taken while in South America.
Dr. Stewart. who has spent a Christ—
mas in Lima, Peru, offered his first-
hand knowledge to an appreciative
audience.

A lecture was sponsored by Pl
Gamma Mu on Wednesday featuring
Dr. Arthur Pound, State historian.
and Director of the division of Ar-
chives and History.

Debate

in common for the present: the type
of peace the United States wants
after the war. and what college stit—
donts can do to help defend their
country."

Hirsh also stated that another
possible topic for debate. would be
to determine what college students
must do to justify their renutinlng
in college during the national crisis
and not be culled slackers.

Debnte Council sponsored a round
table discussion with R.P.I‘. last
Wednesday. “Wl'nit. College Students
Can Do to Help in the Present

cussion. nnd Vernn Snyder and Shir—

Police  Studeri   "

To Prevent Underta ing“

by Betty Gravelie

The raid's the thing, nowadays
at SGT—or at least the Albany Po-
lice Department is afraid it will be.
So, Police Chief William J. Fitz-
patrick announced a list of do’s and
don'ts last week to be followed by
State wayfarers at the sound of the
vacillating “air raid" sirens. Maid or
man who refuses to heed directions
may cause a boom in the undertak-
ing business.

As soon as the “furrin divils" wing
into sight, their number is taken by
the Army Filter Station which im-
mediately passes on the word to the
Police Department which. in turn.
keeps up the chain by relaying the
news to the Fire Department. Then,
every cruising patrol car will aban-
don its role of pick-up for that of a
blaring Mercury: and fire trucks,
owlishiy inclined heretofore. will add
their ear-splitting activity to the
general confusion.

It's a repeated long and short blast
that means “Duck or disintegrate!”
So. when several noisy fire engines
or police cars go whizzlng by, each
headed for different destinations,
don’t complain about the uncoopera-
tiveness of the city's protective forc-

“wheresoever you may find: i ."
Don’t hesitate to crawl into the nears

mine. After all, “pride comes before
a fall (of a bomb).” If you're in the

is cleared. After all. even the at-
mosphere of cut and dried stooginess
is better than that of cutting steel.
If you value your continued exist-
ence, ﬁnd some more ('2) work to
do in the library.

And dormitory rules hold for air
raids, too—no man is to appear above
the first floor of a building or at
the windows. But, strange as it may
seem, basement rooms—the darker,
the better—are urged as places of
safety for all.

And if you're not one of those
