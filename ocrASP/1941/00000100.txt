State’s Eagles were flying high

_7-when they won a 49-46 victory over

a highly-touted St. Lawrence squad
Wednesday evening on the Page
court. St. Lawrence started the
game with an undefeated record
which listed powerful Colgate among
its victims. .

The statesmen came from behind
in the thrilling ﬁnal minutes of
play to win their ﬁrst game of the
scason when Bye Benton sank a foul
shot and followed up with a victory-
assuring basket. This win avenged
the previous loss at the hands of
the Larries.

Both teams played a steady brand
of ball during the ﬁrst half with the
scoring evenly divided. State held
the lead twice but the Larries spurt-
ed toward the close of the half to
lead, 22-15, at the intermission.
Eagles Take Lead

St. Lawrence slowly drew ahead
and at one time led by thirteen
points; then State found itself mid-
way through the ﬁnal quarter and
swiftly closed the gap with Moose
Gerber and Bill Marsland ﬁnding
the hoop for important points. With
only minutes to go Bye Benton tied
the count at 46-46 on a foul shot to
the great glee or a hysterical State
crowd. Then Bill Dickson sank a
foul shot to put State in the lead.
Benton tapped in a basket to sew up
the game which ended a few seconds
later with the State students on their
feet shouting themselves hoarse.

Hank Brauner led the team in scor-
ing, as he has done in every game
so far. with eleven points. Dickson
was next with ten points.

Eagles Nosedtve

The State College Eagles took a
nosedive last night when they lost
a hard fought game on the Page
court to Clarkson Tech by a 51 to

. 28 score.

Bill Marsland started the scoring
with two baskets to give State a
shortlived 4-0 lead. The Engineers
then went on a scoring spree to run
up a 20-9 advantage at half time.

Hard playing featured the second
half which found the State quintet
swiftly falling farther and farther
behind the onrushing Engineers.
The outcome was never in doubt as
Finnegan scored fourteen points and
J. Smith twelve to lead Clarkson to
its 51 to 28 victory.

Marsland led State's scoring with
nine points and played his usual
good defensive game. Brauner tal-
lied seven.

Sports Department Issues CaII
For Victory Song Contributions

by Hickey and Soule

“We need a victory song" say the
students in the hall. the men on the
team. and most loudly of all the
sports department. In a poll taken
by this department, the Publications
Office voted unanimously for a vie-
tory song.

Of course. a genius whom we shall
call the Nameless One. had to say
“Why do we need a victory song.
We won’t use it often enough."

Last Wednesday night, St. Law-
rence Unlvorslty came to play an
underdog State College team. When
the ﬁnal whistle blew. a hysterical
mob jumped up and down yelling its
head off. There was no other way

in which they could express their
feelings. The students longed to
march down the hall singing—but.
no victory song.

The team feels the lack of a song.
Bill Dickson, co-captain. is so en-
thusiastic that he even offered to
write the lyrics. He tells us that
the team sings constantly on their
way to and from games. and all that
they need is a good victory song to
complete their repertoire.

Every Moving-Up Day. each class
writes four or five songs. but no one
has written a victory song for the
college. Because these songs are
of such high calibre. Ira lesh is
positive that State College possesses
plenty of talent to compose a song
that would be worthy of our team.
Hirsh and Periman have both of-
fered to write music to any lyrics
given to them. All that is needed
for a song are words and music.

The cheerleaders are ready and
willing to boost the song by all the
means possible. They promised that
the students will be made well aware
of the songs as soon as entries start
coming.

Ed Reed summed up the whole sit-
uation when he said “We have the
team: we lack the song."

Freshmen Beat Delhi;
Bow To YMCA Team

The Fresh chalked up their ﬁrst
win of the season Wednesday night.
turning back the Delhi Agglcs.
31-l9.

The boys put up a game but los-
ing struggle against the strong YM
CA varsity last night. losing by a
44—18 count. Buck Hipplck accounted
for twelve of the Frosh's points.

The Fresh displayed an effective
defense in noiching their first vic-
tory at the expense of the Delhi
Aggies last Wednesday. Trailing 15-
13 at the half. they penetrated the
Delhi zone for 18 points while hold—
ing the visitors to one field and IMO
foul baskets the second half. Art
Oilvet was high mun with nine
points. bul. the win was distinctly
u crmpcrntive enterprise. Warren
Kuliman sustained a compound nose
fracture but will be ready for action
after the holidays.

In u wild contest that saw 107
points and 46 fouls committed in 32
minutes of playing time. the power-
ful Albany Law quintet outscored
the Fresh 57-50 last Friday.

Takes Top Spot
In Intramural

Potter Club’s 38-18 win over SLS
last night gave them undisputed
possession of ﬁrst place in the intra-
mural league. The teams looked
evenly matched for the ﬁrst half,

.- Potter leading, 17-10. At the open-

ing of the second half SLS gained
four quick tallies then Potter took
over and was never in danger for
the rest of the contest. Ed. Reed
led the scoring with 12 points.

The KDR-College House game
was a dull affair with neither team
showing much form. At one time
College House led 10-0. but at the
loss of Ruback they slowed up and
eked out a mere 14--9 win.

Potter Club recorded its second
victory of the week when it decisive-
ly defeated a Kappa Beta aggrega-

tion. 33-7. Potter outplayed its op-
ponents throughout the contest and
won handily. compiling a 16-2 lead
at half-time.

After having played the upper
half of the league, the Ramblers
invaded the second division and
emerged victorious in two contests.
With Dan Bucci piling up 16 points,
the commuter squad scored its ﬁrst
win of the season by outscoring
Thomas More 33-20. The Ramblers
next encountered the Sayles Hall
boys and again were victorious.

This contest was a see—saw battle
throughout, they however. took the
lead in the ﬁnal minutes and were
still one point ahead at the ﬁnal
whistle to win 25—24. Kiley was the
big gun for the winners with 18
points while Woodworth scored 12
for the losers.

Ping Pong Tournament
Nearing Final Games

The ping pong tournament is run-
ning like a well-oiled machine, ac-
cording to Art Flax who is guiding
it through to the ﬁnals. The tourna-
ment is nearly over, the ﬁrst three
rounds having already been played
leaving only the semi-finals yet to
be decided. Art Flax hopes that it
can be completed entirely before the
Christmas vacation.

So far three of the four semi-
ﬁnalists have been chosen. Hank
Brauner toppled Carr, and Stiller
beat Bittman to reach that “clutch”
position. Dickson upset Doc Cooke
to reach the half mark.

A Fight Song

Sports fans have come up to us
and asked, Why does State stand
out as a college which lacks one of
the most important elements of a
complete sports program — a ﬁght
song?

Today we take up the challenge
and ask the remainder of those
wishing to see our college advance
on the athletic front—why don’t we
have a ﬁght song?

A ﬁght song is one written for
the purpose of stimulating action——
to add color to the sports program—
and to add prestige to the institu-
tion.

Each year the cheerleaders make
a sincere but ineffectual attempt to
boost the morale of the team by
holding pep rallies which are at-
tended by the curious (and compul-
sion at chapel) to make everyone
conscious of the fact that we do
have athletes who are giving up
hours and hours of their valuable
time in an effort to notch a place
in the log of sports for their Alma
Mater.

But for constructive purposes.
there is no reason under the sun
(and we DON’T mean the Rising
Sun!) why we can not have a ﬁght
song written—by some of the stu-
dents. State has the talent. Why
let it go to waste?

We are not asking you to write a
better song—~just a song!

Look at Notre Dame. Ohio State.
or Cornellntheir songs are sung and
played from coast to coast. Even
State fans must resort to the hair-
raising Stein Song of the University
of Maine when the spirit so moves.

Therefore, we urge you—in the in—
terests of your college and athletic
teams. to please get together this
Christmas vacation and collaborate.
elaborate. or resort to plagiarism. if
necessary—but someone please bring
back some kind of a musical score—
and we promise you—the State Col—
lege Band will play it completely
and so loudly that the referees will
have to ﬁre a pistol to be heard!
