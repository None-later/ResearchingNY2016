ALBANY, NEW YORK, FRIDAY. JANUARY 9,194!

Wednesday Night's Test Finds

Choral Society,
Harpist Present
Varied Concert

‘ By Bernard Perlman

Dr. T. S. H. Candlyn diiected the
State College Choral Society last
night in a program that ran the
gamut from folk songs and hymns
through spirituals and opera—~and
ran it all in top form. The chorus
sang with a freshness of tone and an
exuberance of spirit that remained
with it all through the evening.
Mary-Doroth Alden, '45, and Au-
drey Benfleld, '43. were featured
soloists. but it was Earl Snow’s saga
of a Kentucky Iifoonsliiner that
captured the audience's fancy and
had to be repeated.

Miss Betty Paret appeared both
as composer and performer. Oddly
enough, her best work was done
with the three classical pieces which
opened her program. The impres-
sionistic, modern pieces. which com-
prised the second half of her pro-
gram were tantalizing, but still
unsatisfying. It requires the artistry
of a Salzedo to create a mood com—
patible with the brevity of these
subtle compositions.

Retaining audience interest in a
harp program is somewhat of a feat
in itself, but Miss Paret held her
audience through her ability to
elicit all varieties of tone from her
instrument.

The mighty Beethoven‘s Hallelu-
jah which concluded the concert,
was done with a power and inten-
sity of choral singing which over-
shadows performances of the past
three years. John Nordell, '39.
again demonstrated that he is one
of the outstanding accompanists in
the capitol district.

NYA Funds Face Cut
Declares Dean DeLaney

The college has been warned of
a cut in the NYA funds—probably
to come after February! There will
be no increase in the number of
NYA students leaving their NYA
jobs. This regulation has been in
effect since November 21, according
to Sara T. DeLaney, Dean of We-
men.

“We are uncertain how much our
funds will be out," said Dean De-
Laney. “but it. is expected that the
cut will comprise about 25".; of the
present amount. The administration
of the reduced funds is still unde-
termined. However. everyone's al-
lotment will probably be reappor-
tioned. We don’t intend to drop
anyone from NYA if we can help
it."

Talent Show In Assembly

The traditional Talent Show will
be presented in today's assembly.
featuring the Four Men of State. a
Trumpet Trio, and the Rockettes, a
new ballet group. Bill Grattan will
display a “true” jam session. Edna
Marsh, ’45, will be the vooalist of the
morning performance.

Cooper Won't Be Alarmist On Topics

Pertaining to Teacher-Training, Placement

By Betty S. Gravelle and Stengel

State College students can plan
on a continuance of the five-year
program in spite of the present war
according to Dr. Hermann L. Coop—
er, Assistant Connnlssioner of Edn-
cation for Teacher Education and
Certification. On this and on all
other questions pertaining to teach—
er~training and placement Dr. Coop-
er refused to be an alarmist.

The Board of Regents will hold a
meeting next week at which the ad-
visability of shortening the courses
in teacher-training institutions will
probably be discussed. Dr. Cooper
believes that there is not sufficient
cause to shorten the college course
or to telescope it and thus “lower the
standard of teacher education."

Should the college course be
changed to include the entire year
instead of 40 weeks so that students

 

may complete four years of college in
three years, necessary additions to
the faculty and other expenses would
demand approximately a five per
cent increase in state appropriations.
Even though the shortened course is
available it could not be made com-
pulsory.

"There is no teacher shortage at
the present time." said Dr. Cooper,
“except possibly in the ﬁeld of
science, but these positions can be
filled by women." Not many teachers
have transferred from the schools
to defense positions and the ma-
jority of them are teachers of shop
work not liberal arts.

In conclusion Dr. Cooper who
served in the last war stated the
only effect of the present conflict on
college students would be a shortage
of husbands.

 

Drops Make The Ocean;
Nickles Will Aid Defense

“Five cents please!”

“. . . . . Just five cents, one-
twentieth of a dollar, that’s all
folks . . . . . . ."

This is not the cry of a bark-
er advertising Little Egypt or
the Bearded Lady. but rather the
shout of the ticket seller at the
dances following the home has-
ketball games.

But don’t worry. The cause
is a good one. The money to be
collected will be given to the Red
Cross or some other worthy or-
ganization to help in the na-
tional emergency.

Myskania thought of the idea,
MAA considered the idea, MAA
okeyed the idea. and the stu—
dents are asked to come across
with the cash.

StudentsTake Part
In War Program

With 539 students signing up for
defense work, State College has tak-
en its first step toward actual par-
ticipation in the war program. De-
fense classes will not begin until
next semester when each student
may take only one course at a time.
although he may start another as
soon as that is completed.

Over one-half of the total num-
ber of “signees” were interested in
first aid while a slightly smaller
number checked home-nursing. The
auto mechanics course did not at-
tract. as large a number since only
about one-fifth signed for it. Classes
in nutrition, signalling and com-
munication. and publicity will rank
next as regards size. Shop mechan-
ics was the least popular with only
12 students choosing it.

More concrete defense work in
the line of sewing will be carried
on by over a hundred State stu-
dents who are to be assisted and
supervised by members of the fecal-
ty or their wives. since all Red Cross
sewing must be done under super-
vision.

In spite of attendance at defense
classes, State students must keep
up their college work. according to a
terse statement by college authori-
ties. Defense classes are to be
considered as compulsory as college
classes, once they are entered.

 

VOL. xxvr, No. 14

Post Wardens Chosen-
To Check On Lights
In Each Group House

To prepare State College group
houses for the city-wide blackout
scheduled for Monday evening, a
practice blackout was conducted
Wednesday night by four faculty
members. The trial resulted in a 90%
efficiency, unusual for a first at-
tempt at such a new experience. Dr.
Louis C. Jones, Instructor in English,
expressed complete satisfaction over
the “absolute willingness to cooper-
ate on the part of the students."

Special post wardens and sub-war-
dens were appointed in each group
house to check on lights and super-
vise the efficient carrying out of the
rules. The chief aims of the black-
outs were: To get all lights out as
soon as possible; To get people in the
safest and most comfortable places
available; in short, to create the least
amount of trouble for the city air-
raid wardens.

Houses Blackout Quickly

Two and a half minutes was the
longest time taken by any house,
this in a large dormitory where the
warning whistles could not be heard
well on the top floor. Twenty-six sec- '
onds was the record. The most quiet
houses proved to be the quickest. and
no: a single personal accident occur-
re .

Opportunities were given the stu-
dents to ask questions and many in-
telligent suggestions from them
brought about changes in the pro-
cedure. “You’ve put us in the cellar——
why? We were told not to go there."
—was the most common question.
Dr. Jones explained that cellars were
found to be the safest places from
the danger of shattering glass and
shrapnel splinters from falling
bombs, as well as the most spacious.
and well ventilated places.

Rooms Should be Lighted

The rooms that the students will
occupy during blackouts should be
lighted if possible, Dr. Jones believes,
but in order to avoid any escape of
light, he advocated making test be-
fore the city blackout. Radios should
be run also to relieve the tensity of
the situation. though any luminous
dials must be covered first. “Remem-
ber." Dr. Jones said, “you can see a
100 watt light 12%- miles through the
air. a match it- mile and a headlight
20 miles. And bombers have orders
to bomb the lights."

When asked about the actual pos-
sibility of an air raid here. Dr. Jones
replied: "If America should get
token suicide raids, I think we have
a reasonable chance of getting them,
more so than New York City, since
Albany is in a triangle, where there
are definite military objectives: e.g.,
the General Electric Company, the
American Locomotive Company. the
Watervllet Arsenal and large oil de-
posits. If the trans-Hudson bridges
were demolished. troop movements
would be held up for many days,
while traffic was re-routed through
New England."

Clear Cellars and Attics

To add to safety during air-raids,
attics and cellars should be com-
pleter cleared of papers and other
inflammable material, since the first
bombs would be incendiary to light.
fires to indicate more important ob-
jectives.

Dr. Jones, Dr. Mary Goggln, In-
structor in Latin, Dr. Robert Rienow,
Assistant Professor of Social Studies,
and Miss Sara Tod DeLaney, Dean
of Women, conducted the trial black»
outs. Further instructions concerns »
ing the city blackout, particularly in
reference to students present in the
college at the time of the blackout.
will be given by Dr. Jones in ink
morning's assembly.
