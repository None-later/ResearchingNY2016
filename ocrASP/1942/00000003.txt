Miles Of biographical sketches of
men famous in Latin American his-
" tory. In an attempt to unfold the
history of Latin America through the
' lives of such illustrious patriots as
Sarmiento, De Toledo, and Padre

Kine. _
Dr. Stewart has traveled through-
‘ ‘ out South America, making an inten-

‘ ’ sive study of the history of its separ-

ate states. In 1936-1937, Dr. Stewart
spent an entire year traveling in
South and Latin America with Dr.
William E. Dodd, late Ambassador to

66min .‘ and

 

y _ . ofessor of History
at the University of Chicago.

In the preface to the book, the
author declares that the work was
written at the suggestion of Dr. Don-
nal V. Smith, Professor of Social A
Studies, who expressed the need in"
the schools for a thorough knowledge
of Latin American history. Portions
of the book were used in manuscript
form in Milne High School, and Dr.
Stewart also expresses in the preface
his appreciation to these Milne stu-
dents for their contributions.

Upon declaring his intention of
writing this book, Builders of La-
tin America, in the summer of 1914,
Dr. Stewart was given a Social
Research Grant to finance his in-
vestigations. He is new writing a
book on Chinese Immigration in
Peru.

“If part time work is desired by
any student during the second se- V
master, he must fill out a new ap-
plication with the Part-Time Em-
ployment Bureau," explained Har-
old Feigenbaum, Director of PTEB.

The new applications must be
filled out regardless of those filled
out last semester. The entire PTEB
application ﬁles will be disposed of;
therefore, no leads will be given out
until students comply with the new
regulations.

No applications will be accepted
which do not contain the student’s
complete schedule for the second
semester. If schedules have not been
received from the registrar's office,
and the student is in need of imme-
diate work, Feigenbaum should be
consulted personally.

By Jeanette Shay

“Do you want to see the nicest
present I got for Christmas?” said
Jean Kafka to her unsuspecting
roommate. Whereupon she held out
her left hand, and there upon her
third ﬁnger was — well, you know
what. But Jean was wrong if she
thought she was going to be differ-
ent, for six other girls had similar
presents to show to their roommates.
A few State femmes went even fur-
ther and got their men in the flesh.
Just imagine getting a husband for
Christmas!

Armede Black’s friends were
amused to hear that she is “fading
from Black to Brown." Her future
hubby calls here Mediocre. When
asked what she likes best about him,
she replied, “I like his black curly
hair,” and she added, "Least of all
I like his jaloppy.” She conﬁded,
“The first thing he wants after we’re
married is twins.”

Many of the future brides were
very surprised when they received
their proposals. “I was completely
surprised,” said Erma Inglis. “I re-
ceived the ring before the proposal.
Freddie tossed the box at me and
said, ‘Here, see if this will fit,
Honey.’ ” “You can quote me as be-
ing flabbergasted," declared Jean
Kafka, “but I love it.” Millie Mattice
expected a ring for Christmas. “He
proposed last year when we were
coming home from a dance," she
said.

We’ve all heard of girls getting
married “when Papa consents." El-
eanor Grounds' marriage depends on
Uncle Sam. She’ll be married in
July if he doesn't interfere. What
she likes best about her man is his
appearance but she doesn’t like his
habit of always being on time.

No date has been set for Janet

Dixon’s marriage. When asked Whe-

ther or not she had a romantic pro-
posal, she said, “No, we, were Just
talking about things, and all of a
sudden—”

Mary Klein can't remember any
definite proposal. "He might have
proposed to me at Howard John-
son's," she stated. She doesn’t ex-
pect to be married for “years and
years” since her prospective hubby
is going into the army and she is
“devoted to the idea of spending a.
few years at teaching."

Bea Hirsch completes the list of
State women engaged during Christ—
mas vacation, but an attack of
mumps makes it impossible for her
to tell us any of the interesting de-
tails.

Mary Jane Evans (Mrs. Joseph
Bosley), Jane Freeman (Mrs. Syd-
ney Carter), and Elsie Johnston
(Mrs. Herbert Gumaer) are taking
no chances. They really caught their
men. “I don’t like anything best.
about my husband,” said Mary Jane
Evans. “I just like everything
about him." One thing Jane Free-
man likes particularly about her
husband is that he doesn’t mind
when she talks baby talk.

Listen girls! This is encouraging.
Elsie Johnston who has just an-
nounced her marriage, took the step
a year ago Thanksgiving, and she
isn’t disillusioned yet. She still
thinks “Herb is just wonderful."

'43 Junior Prom

Committee: For Luncheon
Are Released By Msiiice

The Junior Prom of the class of
1943, with a name band and a form-
al coronation theme, is scheduled for
February 20. Don Redman’s recent-
ly reorganizad band has been en-
gaged to furnish music from 10 P. M.
to 2 A. M. at the Aurania Club. In
addition to these attractions, the
price of bids is decidedly lower than
in past years—$2.75 including tax.

Because Redman has but recently
reorganized his band, the Junior
class was able to hire him for the
annual dance. Rcdman has done ar-
rangements for both Paul White-
man and Jimmy Dorsey, doing Dor-
sey’s Deep Purple. He uses his own
song Clmnl of the chd as his
theme. Other musicians agree that
his ideas and conceptions are us-
ually well ahead of the times; his
1926 arrangements were in the jazz
idiom of 1941. He and his Harlem
orchestra have been heard on the
air waves with the Mills Brothers.

The hot—cha Harlem maestro him-
self is an interesting personality. He
is one of the shortest orchestra lead—
ers in captivity, measuring only a
little over five feet. Rcdman is also
a confirmed cigar smoker.

Midnight of February 20 will see
the coronation of Prom Queen,
when one 01' the five gII'ls nominat—
ed ycstcrday by the Junior class will
receive the crown, symbol of sever-
eignty, from the hands of last
year’s Queen, Marion Duffy.

Junior luncheon will complete the
formal weekend of the class of ’43,
and will be held on Saturday, Feb-
ruary 21, at Jack's Restaurant.

Byron Benton is general chair-
man of the luncheon; Morris Ger-
ber has charge of arrangements;
Marion Adams will be the speaker,
and Shirley Jennings is in charge
of place cards. The price of the
luncheon will be eighty-five cents.

This year the Junior class voted
to dispense with the annual tea
dance, usually held in the afternoon
following Junior luncheon. Due to
the fact that so many members of
the class have to work on Saturday
afternoons, it was decided that the
best policy would be not to hold the
tea dance.

 

Jones’ Blackout Warning
Goes Over Big In Florida

Thanks to the quote from a
recent edition of the STATE COL-
Lson News (the one posted on
the wall opposite the Publica-
tion Office), a few hundred ar-
my lads in Tampa, Florida.
think that our own Dr. Louis
C. Jones is no less than a pro-
fessor of Physics and an au-
thority on light.

It all came about when Den~
nls Dole, ’41, showed the NEWS
story on State College’s private
blackout to the Major for whom
he works. Impressed by Dr.
Jones' statement on light visi-
bility, the Major ordered signs
like the one you see in the lower
hall of Draper printed and dis-
tributed.

Dr. Jones is living in hourly
expectation of receiving an
honorary degree in science from
some Florida university.

Reinhardt Cancels
D&A Engagement

Max Reinhardt, the famous (li-
l‘L’f'lOl' who was recently exiled
from (Icrmuny, has cancelled his
engagement of February 25 with the
Dramatics and Arts Association. Mr.
Reinhardt, in a letter to Elizabeth
Simmons, President of D.&A., ex-
plained that a broken arm necessi-
tated that he drop not only his
appearance at State College but also
his entire tour.

This famous actor, playwright,
and producer was to have directed
the ﬁrst rehearsal of a play before
an audience. Miss Agnes Futterer,
Assistant Professor of English, was
to select the play from a list sub-
mitted by Mr. Reinhardt and to
choose the cast by a system of com—
petitive try—outs in which any State
College student could participate.

The Dramatics and Arts Associa-
tion has not made a substitution for
Max Reluhardt’s performance be-
cause of the short notice that was
given. The next presentation will be
Barton Mumaw, the interpretive
dancer, who will appear on April 15.

Following a successful career as
one of the ’l.‘ed Shawn dancers, he
has given many recitals throughout
the country. Students may obtain
tickets in exchange for student tax.
All other seats will be reserved for
$1.10.

 

Defense Classes

Begin Next Week

No Instruction Available
For Auto Mechanics Now

Classes in ﬁrst aid. nutrition,
home-nursing and air raid precau-
tions will start next week, according
to Sara T. Delaney, Dean of WO-
men. As yet, there have been no ar-
rangements made for the auto me-
chanics course due to lack of in-
structlon.

There will be four divisions of
the first aid course; two. instructed
by Mrs. G. Vinall, Social Director
of the Girls‘ Dormitory, will meet at
Pierce Hall. Tuesday at 7 P.M., and
Saturday at 9:30 A.M. Another first
aid class, under the instruction of
Dr. Dorwaldt and Miss Johnston,
will be held in Room 101, Husted, at
7 PM. Wednesday night.

Of the four home-nursing classes
scheduled for this semester, only two
will meet. The other two will start
as soon as materials for the teachers
come from Washington. Home Eco-
nomics teachers from Philip Schuy-
ler High School and Albany High
School are in charge of nutrition
classes at 7230 RM. Tuesday and
Wednesday.

Air raid precautions classes, open
only to students who have been spe-
cial postqvardcns, will be instructed
Monday and Thursday nights at
7:30 PM. by Dorothy Hinman,
chairman of all air raid courses.
All women who take and pass the
examination in air raid precautions
will receive a certificate to that ef-
fect while men passing the exam will
obtain a statement allowing them to
go to advanced defense work if they
wish to.

Students will not be able to com-
plete two defense courses by the end
of the semester. Due to an insuf-
ficient number of teachers, some
curses will not start; on schedule.
All students are lll"‘,'Cd to watch the
bulletin board outside of Room 107.

New Cards Ior PTEB

Since all of last semester’s appli—
cation cards have been destroyed
either because of changes in sched-
ules or different types of work de—
sired by individuals, the Part Time
Employment Bureau urges all who
desire jobs this semester to ﬁll in
new cards. It was made clear that
anyone who did not comply with
this request would not be given any
leads.

Defense Industries Attract Low Salaried Teachers,-
lncreose In Living Costs Fails To Ellecl Wage Rise

Don’t be too optimistic, State
Collech The fact that a serious
shortage of qualified teachers is
tin-catching may seem encouraging
on the surface. However, one look
at the pictured graph should dispel
all undue enthusiasm on the part of
would—be teachers. The main reason
for thc growing decrease in teachers
is the inadequate salary paid the
average IIIeIIIber of the teaching
profession today,

in spite of the rising cost of liv-
ing, the salaries paid to teachers
have not increased proportionally.
Living cost has gone up 11%, and
food prices have increased 10%. To
compete with this, teachers are be-
ing forcod to leave the classroom for
defense industries, the National
Commission for the Defense of De-
mocracy through Eduoatlon reports.

Whereas the incomes of factory
workers have received an average
30% increase, and the cash income
from farm products has increased
45%, teachers' salaries on the whole
have remained static, Few schools
have attempted any solution for the
situation, although some cities have
added a 10% “cost of living bonus"
to existing salaries. The Commis-

Ui‘li‘w'

Us

 

 

sion advocates that this system be
used in other communities.

At the present time, there is al-
ready an acute shortage of teachers
in rural village and elementary
schools. particularly in certain sub-
ject areas such as science, industrial
arts. and business education. This
shortage actually threatens to un-
dermine educational standards.

Since many communities have re-
duced teacher qualifications to meet
the shortage. a decrease in the qual-
ity of school work has ensued. Dur-
ing the current year it is expected
that between 5,000 and 10,000 emer-
gency certificates will be issued to
unqualified and partly trained
teachers.

Corresponding with the decrease
in teachers available, the enrollment
in teachers' colleges and schools of
education has also undergone a
marked drop, declining as much as
20': in one state.

'l"th'c should be an average na-
tionwide increase of 15% in touching
salaries, warns the Conunisslon.
Such an increase would tend to hold
many qualified teachers within their
chosen field and to induce students
to consider teaching as a career.
Otherwise the existing shortage in
teaching personnel is certain to be-
come worse. Those who leave the
profession now for better paying
positions are apt to remain in their
new ﬁelds after the emergency is
over.

Definite steps must be taken to
relieve the situation. The Commis-
sion belieVes that “the times permit
a more generous financial support
of the schools."

 

Milne Revives Movie-Past
Sheik Valentino Reappears

To those fluttering females
who never had a chance to have
Rudolph Valentino moon at
them; tonight you can discover
what true love is like! Milne
School will present the great
lover in a revival of his last
picture, "Son of the Sheik."

This picture will be one of the
three old-fashioned moving pic-
tures that the Senior Class of
Milne School will present to-
night in Page Hall. Charlie
Chaplin and Fatty Arbuckle in
“The Knockout," and Our Gang
in "Thundering Fleas.”

Sooooooo, girls, if your boy
friend overwhelms you in the
future with passionate words of
love, blame it on Valentino.

State To Assist
In Radio Defense

Script Production Planned
To Bolster Civilian Morale

“Radio for Victory!” With this
slogan the Albany City and County
Defense Council, will begin another
phase of its war emergency program.
The new venture is scheduled to
get under way February 5. The
group will work on the project un—
der the direction of Dr. William H.
Hartley, Assistant Professor of Edu-
cation; Dl'. Robert Rienow, Assist-
ant Professor of Social Studies, and
Dr. Louis C. Jones, Instructor in
English. Group members will work
on a radio script production pro-
gram for the purpose of building up
civilian morale. While it is not ex-
clusively a State College project, a
large number of State students are
members of the group.

Group meetings are scheduled for
every Thursday from 7 to 9 PM. The
work plande is divided into three
sections: research, writing and pro-
duction. Scripts turned out will be
presented at Radio Center. Script
content will be based upon the ma-
terial for which the Defense Council
asks. The main job is the general
productth angle; acting is the sec-
ond step.

At the present time, more people
who can take shorthand are needed.
This qualification is necessary for
the interview angle of the project.
People working in all branches of
service will be interviewed by group
members to determine what part
civilians can play in the emergency
program, The material obtained
through these interviews will be in—
corporated into scripts and pre-
sented to the station.

Students who have a flair for
writing, dramatics or directing will
find ample outlet for these bouts in
this branch of the civilian service
program. Those lnterestcd should
contact Dr. Jones.

 

Victory Book Campaign
Will Start Next Week

As an additional effort to aid in
war work, the Books for Victory
Campaign will start officially Mou-
duy. The campaign, national in
scope, is sponsored by the American
Library Association and has for its
purpose the collection of books for
men in the service. Miss Mary
Cobb, College Liin'arian, in charge
of the drive at State, has appointed
a faculty member from each depart-
ment to contact the faculty and a
student committee to solicit the stu-
dents. The members of the student
committee are: Rita Hell, '42, chair-
man; Mary Powers, ’41; Betty
Knowlton, '42; Lola Hailey and
Clarice Weeks, juniors; Roderick
Fraser, '44.

The faculty has already contrib-
uted 800 books.

Books should be deposited in the
large box opposite the Co-op.

Sayles Declares
, No Change Made
In Spring Recess

Plan Outlined to Students
Concerning Naval Aviation

Dr. John M. Sayles, President of
the College, yesterday denied rumors
that the Spring vacation had been
reduced to four days. The dates re-
main March 25 to April 6. At the
same time, Dr. Sayles released a
communication from the Navy De-
partment concerning a new program
for male students Interested in be-
coming Naval Aviators (Class V-5).

Students of the college were mis-
led by statements of an immiment
cut in vacations of the New York
State schools published by various
local and out-of—town newspapers.
When asked whether State College
would be affected by any change in
vacation or semester dates, Dr.
Saylcs stated that the administra-
tion contemplated no change in the
college calendar which is in opera-
tion at the present time. The re-
vised second semester schedule
which made room for the Faculty
Workshop in June, published in the
Srarc Cottaoa News of October 17,
1041, still remains the official col-
lege calendar.

Male college students interested in
becoming Naval Aviators will be
able to complete their current col-
lege year if they successfully pass
their physical examinations and en-
list now. College juniors and son-
iors may be deferred from call to
active duty after completion of their
college year if they so request. Soph—
omores may he enlisted at once by
the Naval Aviation Selection Boards
provided that they can present let-
ters from the registrars that they
are currently enrolled in college and
have reasonable expectations of
completion by the end of their pres-
ent school year of half the number
of credits required for a degree.

10% Cut Imminent
In College Budget

The long-feared cut in the State
College activities budget is immi-
nent today as the enrollment, not
up to par in September. has de-
creased eveII more since the ﬁrst
semester It is estimated that a
10% general cut will be necessary
in order to relieve the depleted ﬂ-
nanclal status of the college.

Of 1000 taxable students expected
in September, only 942 undergrad-
uates were enrolled. At the present
time, there are only 960 students,
including graduates, in the college.

There was a total of 1025 students
at State in September. Since that
time 65 men .md women have left
school, for the army, marriage, to
take jobs 01' for other reasons. Each
of these 05 students were refunded
half of their student tax. taking
$455 dollars away from the complete
sum reserved for the activities
budget.

Three items cannot be reduced,
the Freshman Handbook, which has
