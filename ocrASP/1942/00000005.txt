Resumes Action;

Poller First Half Viclors;
Power More Evenly Divided

Last night, the Page Hall gym
once again resounded with the
thuds of a volley of basketball shots,
and frequent outbursts of yells
which soon subsided to the usual
ball-smacking and the sound of the
referee’s whistle—Intramural bask-
etball was back in circulation.

Ken Johnson and Hal Singer,
chairmen of the league, announced
that the games of the second half
of the schedule will be played in the
evenings instead of the afternoons.
There will be two games scheduled
on Monday and Thursday and also
on Tuesdays, whenever possible.

Potter Tops Scoring

During the first half of the intra-
mural schedule, Potter Club, alone,
remained undefeated to lead the
loop. The State Street squad dis-
played plenty of power in conquer-
ing all their opponents handin and
also lead the teams’ total scoring
with 257 points. College House
stands second in this respect with
174 points.

The CH squad, assemblying almost
a complete new team, showed up
Very well, losing but one game, and
that to EEP. Its zone was the
toughest defense to penetrate as it
held its opponents to a total of 112
points. SLS limited their adversar-
183 to 125 points, while Potter per-
mitted 132.

The most disappointing features
of the first round were KB and
KDR. The former squad, predicted
as a potential pennant contender,
slipped miserably, losing four con-
secutive games after having won
the first three. KDR was also ex-
pected to do much better than its
lone win and six losses indicates.

Weak Teams Improve

,On the other hand, the Ramb-
lers showed a considerable improve-
ment after losing the first four
games, and can no longer be con-
sidered setups for any team in the
league. Sayies Hall and Thomas
More, too, have shown progress, and
it will not be surprising if they win
more games this semester.

It appears, on the whole, that in
the second round, the strength of
the league will be more evenly di-
vided. Potter, however, still looms as
the team to beat. The EEP-College
House contest next week will have
a definite bearing on the final out-
come.

Cooke Aids Merritt
In Coaching Frosh Five

The 1942 edition of the fresl'nnan
basketball team has been working
out this week under the surveillance
of their new coach, David “Doc”
Cooke.

Cooke took over when Paul Mor-
ritt who had been handling the
freshmen, was declared fit for a
little basketeering on his own. This
order has since been rescinded, and
Paul will now stay on to aid Cooke.

The new member is a grad stu-
dent and balls from Buffalo State.
In an earlier issue, an "Eight-ball”
column was devoted to him and his
athletic prowess is thus probably
familiar to the two readers of this
page.

The new afternoon practice hours,
have changed the personnel of the
squad somewhat. Dick Beach, Stan
Gipp, Curt Pfaff, and Frank Wood-
worth are now sporting the frosh
uniform, while Joe Tassoni, who
works afternoons, left the squad.

STATE COLLEGE NEWS, FRIDAY, JANUARY 30, 1942

CARL

Good Headwork

We have every indication that the
new mentor of the frosh outfit is
using his head these days. In fact
we have positive evidence.

Cooke was playing a very aggres-
sive game of ping-pong in the com-
mons the other 'day, when his
worthwhile opponent, N. Giavelli
walloped a kill shot toward the wall.
The chef made a quick lunge in the
general direction of the ball and not
only did he succeed in hitting the
little white pill, but the fire extin-
guisher as well. The game was call-
ed off, but the extinguisher would
respond to no such order. General
confusion reigned while the boys
squirted the “thing” in all direc-
tions.

Cooke is wearing a patch on his
bean, but we're not sure whether it
was the extinguisher or the janitors
that did the job—so, bring on your
ineentiary bombs!’

The Famous V-7

So We warned you. Another mem-
ber of the basketball squad has now
signed up with the Naval Reserve
and received the well-known V-'l.
He is Bill (Deacon) Dickson, valu-
able co-Captain of the varsity bas-
ketball squad. Bill will not have to
go—ladies—until he graduates!

While on the subject of basketball
men, let us not forget to give our
welcome to Frank Hansen, who has
returned to school and has secured
permission to play basketball again.
All Frank said was “I'm glad to be
back."

Hansen will be a smart player for
the opponents to cope with. His
brand of ball has been spectacular
and the unexpectedness of his shots
were a constant headache for
State's adversaries.

'l‘he Ebony Sphere

The Royal Order of the Ebony
Sphere welcome two new members,
who passed the rigorous examination
of the Committee on Admissions.

They are Louis Rabineau and Gert
Jacobson.

Louie got his for failing to follow
the order peculiar to freshman
pledgeship. When one of the good
brethern slipped and fell on the
ice, Louie was commanded to give
a helping hand in the great uplift-
ing. Failing to comply promptly,
Louis now sports a “black beauty",
but of course, he insists that it was
accidental.

Gert was allowed to join under
the ruling that any girl who hands
a fellow a ringer, makes up for not
possessing one. As we have the facts,
a sparring match was going on with
brother Hale—and, well, you know
the rest.

And thirty.

Eagles Prepare
For Stretch Drive

Hansen Reioins Varsity
As Team Drills For Trip

The State College Eagles will go
through a final week of intensive
drill before embarking on the sec-
ond half of their schedule. The boys
are determined to reverse the re-
sults of their rather disappointing
first semester during which they
won two games and lost five.

Hansen Returns

Along with plans for the final
grind comes one item of good news
and two which are not so good.
Frank Hansen, a spark of last year's
team, is back in school and is now
working out with the squad. That’s
good, but Paul Merritt, who was
kept off the team by a heart ail-
ment, then received permission to
play and appeared in two games, has
been forbidden by the college phy-
sician to continue playing. That’s
bad.

Then too, Bob Comb's removal
from the squad for probably a week
while he undergoes medical treat-
ment is not good news either.

Play in New York

With Comb’s return to the squad
in time to make the New York trip
next week end and the addition of
Hansen, the team should be in good
condition to meet Brooklyn Poly-
technic Institute's highly-touted un-
defeated quintet and Pratt Insti-
tute’s ever scrappy squad.

Coach G. E. Hatfield has express-
ed his intention of giving- the under-
classmen on the team greater oppor-
tunities for action. This will at least
give them experience! He also stat-
ed that practice scssions have been
changed to Monday, Tuesday, and
Thursday afternoons.

I-M Bowling League
Nearing Completion

Since only five matches are left
to be played, Gene Guarino hopes to
bring the men’s intramural bowling
league to a successful conclusion by
the end of next week. At the present
Potter Club is leading the league
with 11 wins and one loss. SLS
is second with eight wins and one
loss, and KDR third with five wins
and seven losses. The Ramblcrs.
Kappa Beta, and Sayies Hall, follow
in that order.

Individual honors so far belong to
Max Reeves, who holds the high-
est average, 176.3, and Bob Seifert,
for his 209 single. The honor bowl-
ers on each team, that is, those with
the highest averages are: Reeves,
SLS, 176.3; Gillan, Ramblers, 165.8:
Seifert. Potter Club, 164.1; Tas-
soni, KDR, 150.1; Kensky, KB, 147;
Jordan, Sayies Hall, 133.

 

Feud Flares In New Stall“,-

Basketball Bollle Today

Last week the Sports Staff of
the News, confidently flexing
bulging museles, challenged the
Editorial outfit to a fight to the
finish on the basketball court.
Throwing out hollow chests, the
Editorial board accepted the
challenge.

Ed Holstein, captain of the
Ed department, suggests that
girls will probably be necessary
to replace him after he gets tir-
ed. Kay Doran objected, saying
she was too reserved to be a “re-
serve.” Fio Gaspary wants to be
“forward.”

The Sports department does-
n‘t object to having the girls
serve as subs (not the kind that
sub-merge.) Some even offer to
sit on the bench with the re-
serves.

The contest will take place
this afternoon at 4:30 PM. in
the gym.

 

GirlsI Basketball
Features Triple

In a double-header girls’ basket-
ball session Wednesday afternoon,
the Western Hall team beat Junip-
ers 15-7, and Newman conquered
Commuters B 42-14. In the evening
game, Dorm B tromped over Dorm C
by a 56-0 score.

In the first afternoon game, West-
crn Hall held Junipers to seven
points by their clever guarding
combination, Drury. Clark, and
Carey. At the half the score was
6-5 in Western's favor. At first,
Junipers had Western confused by a
new pass play, but Western soon
found a way to break through.

The quick Newman forwards built
up their score despite the Commut-
ers ample guards. The score increas-
ed by irregular spurts.

The night game was an absolute
\\’.lll{ over for Dorm A. Kit Herdman,
Leda LaSalle. and Mary Domann
formed an unbeatable trio. Dorman
was high scorer in the game with 32
points.

Herdman Takes
Ping-Pong Finals

Gamma‘Kap Leads League
In Feminine Bowling Loop

Kit Herdman, basketball captain,
defeated Dot Gregory Wednesday
afternoon, thereby garnering the
ping-pong title in the WAA tourna-
ment which has been sharing the
sports spotlight with the bowling
tournament since early December.
Dot had just won her contest against
Claire Schwartz.

Flo Garfall and Nora Giavelli,
tennis rivals, were runners-up in
the contests in which twenty girls
participated.

In the WAA bowling league, team

Stiller Tops Brauner
For Ping-Pong Honors

State College ping-pong found a
new champ as Al Stiller defeated
Henry Brauner 3-2 January 14 to
take the tournament title.

In the first game of the match
Brauner took the game in stride.
However, Stiller broke through in
the second and third games to win.
These were the first games which
Brauner dropped since the start of
the tournament. Henry again came
through in the fourth to take a
close game only to be beaten later.

Formed to Work

In Delense Council

First Broadcasts Include
Present Day Problems

The script production project, an-
other phase of the defense program,
in which many State students will
participate. has begun active work
At present. four committees have
been formed to do research work on
current topics which will be covered
in the ﬁrst group of broadcasts. Dr.
Robert Rienow, Assistant Professor
of Social Studies, is in charge of
the research work; Dr. William
Hartley, Assistant Professor of Ed-
ucation, will be responsible for the
production of the scripts, and Dr.
Louis Jones. Instructor in English,
will be in charge of the writing of
the scripts. Beatrice Hirsch, ’42, is
general chairman of the four com-
mittees.

Topics Concern Present Situation

The four subjects which are to be
included in the ﬁrst broadcasts are
those that deal with topics concern-
ing the present day situation. The
first committee will do research work
on the role which the public library
plays in defense; the second group
will work on posters under Miss
Baldwin's direction in public
schools; the third will deal with
some phase of the salvage prob-
lem; the fourth committee will do
research work on the problem of
sugar in regard to substitutes and
ration cards. The chairmen of the
respective committees are: Robert
Bartman, Shirley Wurz. David Sla-
vin, juniors, and Jean Sears, '42.
Two Broadcasts A Week

The general plan of this program
is to have the various groups make
a complete survey on their topic;
upon completion of the research
work the groups will meet on
Thursday evenings to write a script
from the gathered material. The
script will then be handed over to
Defense Council for approval. There
will be two broadcasts a week, one
on Tuesday at 1:30 PM. and one
on Thursday at 9 PM; they will
last for 15 minutes, both over WABY.

The productions will deal with na-
tional problems which are also of
local importance.

Students Can Obtain
Defense Saving Stamps

For some time many college 01'-
gunizations have felt that something
should be done to encourage the
sale of defense stamps to the stu-
dent body. However. no organiza—
tion took definite steps to get the
sale started until the administration
took the plan over.

A revolving fund has been estab-
lished in thc 'I‘rcusurcr's Office in
Draper Hull and in the co-op, where
students may purchase slumps at
prices ranging from ten cents up.
When $18.75 in stamps has been
uccumululed, the book of slumps
muy be redeemed for n govcrnnwnt
bond worlh $25 upon inuluriiy in

Dean Sends for Hayeslip;
Only Misloke is Six A’s

Have you been to see the Dean
lately?

Well, Eleanor Hayeslip, ’45,
has and came out smiling. She's
the girl who received six “A’s.”
Her only unforgivable error was
receiving a mere “B” in Gym.
She admits she is not the ath-
letic type.

She confesses she was sur-
prised when Dean Nelson sent
for her—and scared. She sat
uneasily beside the Dean's desk
while he stared at her as only
the Dean can. Then the Dean
shook hands with her, congrat-
ulated her, and Eleanor floated
from the office.

Eleanor has a formula for
study which many State stu-
dents who make frequent visits
to the Dean for other reasons
might heed. She studies.

 

Advanced Dramatics

Tragedy, Fantasy on Tuesday

The two one-act plays to be pre-
sented by the Advanced Dramatics
Class next Tuesday. February 11.,
will be directed by Janet Wood and
Ellen Swartout, juniors.

Miss Wood’s play is a tragedy con—
cerning the trials of an eldest
daughter who is forced to push even
love into the background because of
the hardships of keeping the other
members of the family clothed and
fed. Included in the cast are: Betty
Barden, Ethelmay Tozier, Laura.
Hughes, Betty Marston, juniors;
James McFeeley and Roderick Fra-
ser, sophomores; and Harold Gold—
stein, ’45.

The cast of Miss Swartout’s
fantasy consists of Mary Studebaker
and Lois Hampel, sophomores, and
Betty Taylor and Jacqueline Shaw,
juniors.

Doors will be closed at 8:30 P. M.
and will remain closed until inter-
mission.

Personnel Stall

Undergoes Change

Whillen, Creamer Resign
AsThompson Gets Leave

Three changes in the personnel of
the administrative staff were dis-
closed in an interview with Dr. John
M. Sayies, President of the College.
Jack Whiffen, Chief Engineer, and
George Creamer, Chief Janitor, have
resigned and Laura H. Thompson,
Supervisor of the Cafeteria, has
taken a leave of absence.

The reasons for Whiffen's and
Creamcr's resignations are not
known. Dr. Sayies merely said:
“They laid their resignations on my
desk and I accepted them."

Miss Thompson will head a cafe-
teria at Rhode Island State College,
a school about the same size as State
but different in that there are more
boys than girls. Miss Thompson
will have been here 21 years on May
1. She is not resigning because she
doesn't want to relinquish her po-
sition here until she is sure she likes
her new job.

The cafeteria will continue to op-
erate as is with some supervision
from Dr. Sayies and some from Miss
Fillingham, Instructor of Home Eco-
nomics in Milne. The administra-
tion had only an implied contract
with Miss Thompson—she was not
on the college pay roll.

Mrs. Loretta Carr, the employee
who has been with Miss Thompson
the longest said, “She was tops as a
boss. I’m sorry to see her go."

Eastern l\X/ar Timel

Students of the college are re-
minded of the fact that the Congress
of the United States recently passed
a bill establishing “War Time.” All
clocks in the country will be moved
forward one hour, effective 2 A.M.
Sunday. This will give more hours
of daylight for defense work.

Faculty Organizes
Red Cross Drive

With the spirit of war sacrifice
permeating State, the faculty this
week organized its Red Cross Drive
and Defense Bond Campaign.

The Red Cross Drive is being
conducted in collaboration with the
city of Albany's special war cam-
paign to collect $140,000. Dr. Rob-
ert W. Frederick, Principal of the
Milne School, is in charge of Milne;
Dr. Edith Wallace, Assistant Pro—
fessor of Latin, in Richardson; Dr.
Charles Andrews, Instructor in
Physics, in Hucstcd; Mr. Clarence
Deyo, Secretary-Treusurer of the
College, in Draper; and Miss Mary
E. Cobb, Librarian, in Hawley.

Ninety per cent of the faculty
members and other employees have
indicated their willingness to buy
defense bonds by authorizing a de~
duction of their salaries at the
source. Hencei‘orth, part of their
salaries will be paid in bonds.

Cahill Leads Discussion
At Newman Meeting

At the Newman Club meeting
last night. the Rev. William Cahill.
Professor of Philosophy ut the Col—
lege of Saint Rose, led a round table
discussion on “The Part of the
Church in Education", Supporting
Cnhill on either side of the discus-
sion table were Juno Keri. '42, Shir-
ley Wurz. Clifford Swanson, juniors,
and Marian Sovik, ’44.

Newman Club presents its recently
organized Pamphlet Library, con-
taining pamphlets on religious top-
ics. The library already contains
several hundred titles. Students de—
siring to borrow any of these pam-
phlets should contact Fred Ferris,
’42, through Student Mull.

Newman Club appointed John Da-
iy, '44, the new Business Manager of
the Newmmwws, to succeed Wil-
liam Tucker, '44, who was recently
appointed treasurer of Newman
Club.

Comply to Keep State
From Undue Criticism

In Present Emergency

Dr. Milton G. Nelson, Dean of the
College, this week spoke to Maxson
Reeves, President of Interfraternity
Council, about the advisability of
eliminating public demonstration by
the fraternities in carrying out their
customary “Hell Week”. Following
agreement to this by fraternity
presidents, Miss Sara Tod DeLaney,
Dean of Women, requested Jean
Sears, President of Intersorority
Council, to ask sorority presidents to
adopt similar measures regarding
their informal initiations.

Rumors circulated

Rumors to the effect that the ad-
ministration had deﬁnitely banned
“Hell Week" were circulated around
the college. A strong feeling of dis-
sension on the part of pledges and
sorority and fraternity members
alike immediately resulted. The dis-
senters believed that the elimination
of the customary procedure would
remove an important part of college

-life at a time when any extra-cur-

ricular diversion is more than wel-
come.

Nelson feels that it is the duty of
State students to be especially care-
ful of criticism such as has come
from past fraternity and sorority inl-
tiations since the college is contin-
ually recommending men to the ser-
vice. It is a time when the nation
and community are serious-minded.
In view of this fact, sorority and fra-
ternity presidents have agreed to
comply with the request of the ad-
ministration.

Students On Honor

Therefore students have been
thrown upon their honor in regard
to this matter. The administration
has stated that no official edict has
been issued abrogating “Hell Week".
It is entirely up to fraternity and so-
rority members. Presidents of the
various Greek groups have how-
ever largely consented to eliminate
the public phase of their informal
initiations in view of the present
national situation and the import-
ant position State College plays in
the eyes of the community.

Fraternities to Honor
Pledges, Departing Men

Fraternity pledges and departing
members will be given special honor
this weekend by three Greek letter
organizations. activities including
vic parties and an initiation ban-
quct.

Bernard Arbit, '43, who is joining
the U. S. Army and Kappa Beta
members who have signed up with
the Naval Reserve, will be honored
by their fraternity at a party Friday
night from 8:30 to 12 PM.

Potter Club’s pledges will take
over the house Saturday evening to
sponsor a vic party. The President
of the fraternity and the Pledge
Duly Enforcement Committee have
been invited to attend the celebra-
tion.

After formal initiation, SLS's
newly inducted members will be
guests at a banquet in the Welling-
ion Hotel Saturday at G P. M. Dr,
William Hartley, Assistant Professor
of Education, will be after-dinner
speaker; Hurry Jordan, ’42, toast-
inuster. The evening will be com«
pieted with n vie dance at 9 PM.
