L I Brooklyn Undefeated,-

Pratt Uses Fast Break
To Pile Scores High

At 11:26 this morning the Eagles
embarked for New York where they

will play strong Brooklyn Polytechy

nic and Pratt Institute teams.

Tonight they meet the up-to-now
undefeated Brooklyn Poly ﬁve. who
have beaten such teams as Pratt
and Union. In the Union game tall,
fast Walch and big, left-handed
Brumotte lead the game for Brook-
lyn, and State expects some trouble
from these boys.

Poly plays a man to man defense
with an offensive consisting of
working the ball to the corners and
using a shallow “ﬁgure elght”
around the foul line.

The resemblance of State's offense
and defense to that of Brooklyn's
should make a very interesting game
to followers of basketball.

Pratt Scores High

Pratt Institute plays host to the
Eagles tomorrow night. Pratt plays
an outscoring game. similar to that
of Rhode Island State. Their man
to man defense is often neglected
as they try to run their opponents
into the floor with fast, continuous
scoring. Brooklyn beat Pratt 47-16
at their own game. and Coach Hat-
field has been drilling the boys to do
the same.

Bob Graham showed formidable
spirit as he scored half of his team’s
points against Brooklyn. Another
Pratt high scorer is Al Aquino, who
garnered 13 points in the game with
John Marshall College. State will
have to curb the tallies of these two,
if they hope to beat Pratt.

,Good Sports

“Sportsmanship is one of the out-
standing features of Pratt’s ball
club,” said Coach Hatﬁeld. “They
have always received us well down
there. and we expect to be treated
likewise this year."

Frank Hansen will be in uniform
for the New York trip, although he
will probably see little action, since
he is not entirely in condition yet.
A bad cold has kept Bye Benton out
of practice for a few days, and Bob
Combs is still taking treatments at
the hygiene office.

Coach plans to start Brauner,
Dickson, Marsiand, and possibly
Young, who has been showing im-
provement in recent practices.

The whole team is making the
trip in reserved coaches. A few stu-
dents are accompanying them.

The last two weeks Coach Hat—
field has been drilling the Eagles
in a new type of offense. The team
seems to have improved its scoring
power since the inception of this
system. The hope is that Pratt and
Poly will be caught off guard by the
play's novelty.

Battle For Lead

Newman Hall Heads
League Basketball Loop

Wednesday evening, in a triple
header, Newman Hall beat North-
Western 22-20, Cooper triumphed
over Junipers 28-4, and Dorm C
conquered Dorm B 17-10.

The clever passwork of the New-
man forwards, Giavelli, Garfall and
Trusso, overcame the close guarding
of the North-Western team. Gar—
fall was high scorer making 16 of
the 22 points.

The well-coordinated teamwork
of the Cooper six kept the ball in
their hands most of the game. The
Junipers aggregation fought hard,

tice. High scorer for Cooper was
Marge Ackley shooting eight bask-
ets.

The first half of the Dorm B-
Dorm C game was a walkover for
the Dorm C girls. But in the sec-
ond half Dorm B hit its stride with
the result that, at the end of the
third quarter. the teams were tied.
However, paced by Stewart with sev-
en points, Dorm C overcame its op-
position.

In the afternoon session, Dorm A
struggled against a determined
Moreland Hall team to maintain a
tie lead with Newman Hall. Just
before the ﬁnal whistle blew, Leda
LaSalle made a basket, and the game
ended, 15-14.

Frosh Seek Third Win
Against Delhi Tonight

This afternoon the fresh will
board the bus for Delhi, where they
go on the court against the Delhi
Aggies for their first game of the
’42 season. Not too proud of their
record of two wins against five los-
ses, the yearlings hope to repeat
their previous win from the Aggies
to put another check in the win
column.

Delhi uses a zone defense. but the
frosh have had practice against
various intramural zones and have
learned how to work against it.

Chessmen Request Transportation

in Order to Defend League Cup

Last year the chessan did so
Well with their $75 that the student
association has allotted them the
huge sum of $175. With this money
the team has made but one trip.

Know why?

Well, the railroad rates are high-
er than all—the devil. It would cost
them $30 to $40 to make their long
trips by train. One of the players
had a our last year; and they were
able to make trips to New York.
Washington. Cornell, and various
other colleges. They economized to
the utmost on their trip to West
Point to make it on $4. (Winning
the match. too.) What other organi-
zation ever made that long a trip
for six persons on that amount?

State's pawnpushers won 13 out
of 10 matches and tied two last
year to give them an average of
76%.

The team has made but one long
trip this season. cause they aint got
no car! Possibly they could make
three or four more Journeys this
year. but they don’t feel that they
should spend $30 or $40 for just one
trip to play one or two matches.

The avorage of the team this year
is only 25%, but this can be cxplain~
ed by the fact that the chessmcn
have played but four matches
against the toughest teams in the

league. Some smart freshman will
probably figure it all out and decide
they have won one and lost three.

The boys owe Colgate and the
University of Connecticut return
matches. If they don't manage to
get another chess match with these
schools. our team will lose their
Upper Hudson Valley Chess League
cup without a chance to defend it.

There are two alternatives which
can be taken. Student association
could give the chess team more
money, or some kind-hearted soul
could drive for the chessmen. Al-
ready the college budget is being
cut; so [not cancels the first sugges-
tion.

Algr-bi'nlicully speaking. 2-1 1.

’i‘hcrciore if the chess team does-
n’t get u cur, they can’t play many
more matches. The team is willing
to pay the expenses of anyone who
would take them on their trips. Cer-
tainly the team that made the best
showing for State College last year
should be supported.

Anyone interested in driving to
New York and various other cities
for the chess team is urged to con-
tact Art Fox immediately. Lot’s give
the champions of the Upper Hudson
Valley Chess League a chance to
show their stuff!

 

CARL MITCHELL

 

Martin Speaks

While reading the sage notes of
Whitney Martin’s “Along the Sports
Trail” the other day, we came across
a few gems which are worthy of the
attention of State students.

Our columnist friend is more than
a little alarmed at the prospect of
taking brain-shattering college men
and subjecting them to compulsory
military training.

“It is equivalent to tossing our
young men into a cage of hungry
tigers; to hanging them up by the
thumbs until they look like air-
plane hitch-hikers, and to tieing
them in knots and then soaking
them in water.”

Martin is not taking the side of
the college men, or belittling the
Selective Service policy of taking
these same students. but rather is
lamenting the fact that these lads
have evaded a little extra exercise.

“...the sports-dodger disinte-
grates into a sort of a walking
museum piece. ready to break like
an Egyptian vase at the first tenta-
tive tap.”

Stop, now, and think a little. Does
this discription fit you? How many
median-raisers have found time to
exercise their backs instead of their
digits? Can you picture a State man
carrying a military pack, when his
only pre-lnduction action has been
a wide yawn and a semaphore
stretch of the arm?

“...two or three score of salty
young men took their bumps on the
varsity teams, and liked it.

“The remainder of the student
body was made up of stalwart young
specimens, shaped like everything
from a pumpkin to a pretzel and
whose idea of violence was to swat
a. fly on an angelfood cake."

As humorous as this may sound,
there nevertheless is a serious in-
dictment In the satire. At State we
may not have any pumpkins or pret-
zels rolling through the corridors,
but we do have those whose concep-
tion of violence is a little warped.

The latter go Martin one better.
Instead of swatting flies, they take
to the strenuous swatting of a‘ ping-
pong pill, or a lazy reach to toss a
card in at Commons bridge game.

To cite a sterling example: re-
cently four seniors applied to the
Navy in order to try for the fam-
OUS V-7 of the Naval Reserve. None
of these men had ever participated
in a major sport. One got ill—25%
perfect.

Later two other men applied to
this same Naval Reserve. Both of
these men were members of the
varsity basketball squad. Both made
the grade—100% perfect!

A Fight Song—Again

Recently someone asked. “What
happened to that fight song that
was to be written?"

That's what we’d like to know.
We tried to leave it up to those
members of the student body who
were musically gifted, but no res-
ponse. Not even a ripple was heard.

So we wrote to Fred Waring, but
the good director of “Pleasant 'l‘ime”
politely but firme inferred that the
recent battle with ASCAP had left
things in o. state of chaos, and he
had a lot of back orders to fill.

That throws it back into the lap
of Joe Blow on the home campus.
If the prospect of leaving State
with a lasting contribution. destin-
ed to keep onc's name alive for
years on end is not a sufficient in-
duccn'lcnt, then our sense of values
must necessarily disappear with the
morning mist.
lici’ensc Material

The other day there Was 11 hot
game going on in the intramural
series. Dan Buccl. of the Ramblers
was starring. In fact. he was so
good that when he was finally taken
out of the game, the Ramblers sent
in three men to replace him! Watch
out Dun, lhcrc's a priority on iron.

CH Beats Potter
To Take Top Spot

League Race Tightens
As Result of Contest

A real fight for top position of the
Intramural Basketball League has
developed as a result of the past
week's games. College House took
over Potter Club in their crucial con-
test last Monday to hand the Potter
lads their first defeat in the current
season. Potter Club missed consist-
ently and scored only nine points
while the College House quintet
garnered twelve to emerge vic-
torious.

CH In First Place

Having already defeated the Ram-
blers in a previous game, College
House advanced to ﬁrst place with
a record of eight wins and one loss.

The Ramblers fought on even
terms for three quarters but became
erratic in the ﬁnal stanza, failing

side of a 25—14 score. Oarr scored
10 points for the victors.

KDR Wins, Loses

Kappa Delta Rho returned to the
winning column when they defeated
Kappa Beta 23-16. Kensky and
Graves were high for each team with
12 and 10 points respectively. The
KDR team displayed flashes of its
former winning squads in this game;
however. in their next tussle they
bowed to the Sayles Hall aggrega-
tion 17-16, as Stan Gipp popped in a
field goal with ten seconds re—
maining.

Sigma Lambda Sigma scored al-
most at will as they steamrolled over
a ragged Thomas More ﬁve. The
Pierce Hall neighbors piled up a 21-2
lead at half time and continued to
increase their score for a 41-11 win.
Jordan and Capel scored ten points
apiece for the winners.

Bowling Nears Finish
With Two Teams Tied

With only three more matches left
to be bowled, the intramural bowl-
ing league is rapidly drawing to a
successful close. The match between
Potter Club and Sigma Lambda Sig-
ma next week will definitely decide
the winner. for each team has won
11 and lost one at the present writ-
ing. The other two matches will be
between Kappa Delta Rho, Kappa
Beta and Sayles Hall.

The standings now are: Potter
Club, won 11, lost one; SLS. won
lost ten; Kappa Beta. won four, lost
five. lost seven; Ramblers, won five,
lost ten; Kappa Beta. won four, lost
eight; Sayles Hall, won none. lost
111110.

The contests of the past week
brought about a radical change in
the individual averages. Carr, with
an average of 164.3. moved up to
take first spot. and Bob Sclfert
stands second with an avorage of
164.1.

“WANTED — A leader for folk-
dancing.” So said President Kay
Peterson in a frantic appeal. You
see, girls, the folk-festival (time for
fun for all the femmes) is coming
up next month and some prelimin-
ary groundwork is necessary. Any-
one interested in assuming the po-
sition should contact Kay.

Kegling Popular

League bowling has become so
popular that Win Jones has decided
to continue the WAA tournament as
long as interest doesn’t wane. Wed-
nesday, Psi Gamma was in a tie for
ﬁrst place with Gamma Kappa Phi
by virtue of its victory over Junipers
on Monday. Newman Hall (scheduled
to meet Gamma Kap yesterday at-
ternoon) was in second place.

Despite the enthusiasm among
the group houses. individual bowl—
ing has been slack. WAA gives a.
partial refund on games played at
the Rice Alleys. if they total at least
twelve. And only ten games are re-
quired for credit. Girls, how about
aiming for Ann Monoghan's high
score of 175?
Fencing Match

Next Saturday some lucky co-eds
will fence here with La Salle School
cadets of Troy. Representatives of
State will be chosen on the basis of
ability, form (fencing, of course).
and attendance. This new sport
has many avid devotees who clash
foils every Saturday A. M. Hopeful
candidates for this match must at—
tend tomorrow’s practice to make
the grade. Get out there. gals!

Amazing Program

The WAA sports program is amaz-
ing! Girls can either bundle up in
ski suits and go skating. or slip into
a bathing suit and go swimming on
the same day. The nymphs have
only one more Thursday to get;
swimming credit, as the lists of hours
must be in by Friday. Supervised
skating credit will be given to all
girls husky enough to laugh at the
sub-zero thermometer on Tuesday,
Thursday and Sunday afternoons.
Camp Outing

After an unsuccessful attempt last
weekend to round up a quintet of
girls to go out to Camp Johnston,
Betty Lou Court, captain of Lotta-
Bunkers, is pleased to make the
announcement that TOMORROW
morning five girls ARE going out to
Chatham. The hearty campers in-
clude Pat Frey (in charge.) Elaine
Grogan, Barbara Putinan. Mae Kay
and Mary Sanderson. Have fun,
gals!
Praise In Order

Congrats to champ Kit Hcrdman
of ping-pong prowess. Also to Dot

ners-up.

Sayles Explains New Plan Activities COW“ Regents Oller Plan to '45
To Shorten College Course

To House Frats in Dorm

Draft, Increased Costs
Will Place Societies

In Precarious Positions

Dr. John M. Sayles, President of
the College, met with the members
of Interfraternity Council late last
Friday afternoon and attempted to
clarify for them the effect of the
war on the fraternity housing situa-
tion. He suggested that the fra-
ternities move into Sayles Hall and
offered to store their furniture un-
til they are strong enough to rea-
semble their houses.

Since leases will be presented for
renewal shortly, Dr. Sayles believed
it advisable to inform the fraterni-
ties of what they will be up against
in the next few years. He pointed
out the rise in prices, the uncertainty
of the draft situation. the decrease
in the enrollment of men. The last
two of these conditions make it
practically impossible to predict the
number of men who will return to
college next fall.

Fraternities Hard Hit

All four fraternities will be hard
hit. Kappa Delta Rho owns its house
and has a sizable mortgage which
must be paid. Dr. Sayles suggested
that they rent their house for the
duration of the war. Because of the
shortage of adequate housing in Al-
bany this would not be difficult to
do. Potter Club and Sigma Lambda
Sigma must find smaller houses or
disband. Kappa Beta has no alterna-
tive except to break up.

Dr. Sayles stated that the admin-
istration has no desire to abolish
fraternities. since it believes that
they fill a social need on the cam-
pus. To preserve the integrity of
the organizations, Dr. Sayles pro-
posed that each fraternity rent a
section of the new men‘s dormitory
and store their furniture in the un-
finished bowling room of the build-
ing.

Club Room For Each

Each fraternity would have the
exclusive use of one of the club
rooms and each group would be
given a spare room where commut-
ers and alumni could remain over
night sometimes. Dates for exclusive
dances could be arranged by mutual
agreement. For every five men who
moved into the dormitory a job cov.
ering board could be provided for
one man.

The cost of living in the dormitory
is now $162.00 a semester. Dr, Sayles
stated that he envisaged no change
in this price in spite of rising costs,
since the food is purchased in large
volumes. Payments of room and
board can be made in monthly in-
stallments.

All aspects of Dr. Sayles' proposals
are now under discussion by all fra-
ternities. Action by each one will
be taken soon.

Dells, Crouch Analyze
Civil Service Strikes

Civil service employees’ right to
strike formed the muin topic of dis-
cussion at lust Tuosduy's Forum
meeting in the Lounge at 3:30 P. M.
Ellen Dell's, '43, chairman of the
investigation committee, presented
the majority report and Mary
Crouch, ’48. the minority report.

Shirley Wurz, '43, introduced a
spot resolution concerning the bill
passed by the senate which endan-
gers the conservation of wild life in
the Florida Everglades. Members
are sending letters to the Committee
of Indian affairs in the Housa urg-
ing them to kill the bill.

A number of resolutions to be
sent to a committee were lntl‘odUc-
ed. Frederica Churchill, ’43, gave a
book report on Japan‘s New World
Order—tho book report will be a
regular feature from now on.

 

Governor Urges

Unified Defense

Governor Herbert H. Lehman, in
his speech to last Friday’s assembly,
explained the state defense program.

The governor warned that the
enemy was a “potent striking force"
which offered a real threat to the
American way of life, and advocat-
ed that the State be unified under
a single command over all defense
activities, which should be in oper-
ation twenty-four hours a day, sev-
en days a week. This unified com-
mand would create an orderly.
and efficient machinery to meet the
demands of increasing war produc-
tion for ourselves and our allies.

Declaring that 70% of the war
production of the state was being
done by 60 concerns. the Governor
stressed the importance of sub-con—
tracting production to the smaller
concerns thereby stabilizing and in~
creasing the total output.

Although the governor advocated
sweeping legislation to facilitate ad-
ministration. he stated that it
should be proved that such changes
are necessary only for the period of
emergency. “Do not use this situa-
tion as an excuse to scrap perman-
ent legislation of a social character,”
the Governor warned.

He advised every able-bodied citi-
zen to take an active part in an all—
out war effort. “Everyone can.” said
the Governor. “if we recognize that
we are a cog in a machine stream-
lined for victory.”

Committees Undertake
Radio Research Work

Operations of the State College
War Activities Council are rapidly
expanding with emphasis at the
moment being placed on the Facul-
ty-Myskania basketball game. oth-
er work includes the preparation of
radio defense programs, the sale of
defense stamps in the Co-op, and
the establishment of sewing classes.

The Faculty-Myskania basketball
game and a preliminary game fea-
turing the practice teachers vs. the
Milne seniors are scheduled for
March 20. Representing the faculty
in the main game will be Dr. Don-
nal V. Smith, Mr. Paul Bulger, Mr.
Kooman Boycheff. Dr. James A.
Hicks, Mr. James E. Gemmell, Dr.
William J. Hartley, Dr. Robert Rie-
now, and Dr. Ralph H. Baker. “I’m
taking exercises each evening to get
in shape for the game." said Dr.
Rienow. Both games will be serious.
Proceeds of the games will go first
to the State College War Activities
Council, then to the U. S. O. and
the Red Cross. Admission will be
approximately. twenty-five cents.

Weekly Radio Program

A fifteen minute radio program is
presented each Tuesday afternoon
and Thursday evening by the radio
defense group. The research com-
mittee. under the supervision of Dr.
Rienow, is at present working on
such topics as posters and arts as
used in defense, the sugar shortage.
front lawn vegetable gardens, and
the motor mechanics course. Some
of the research is prepared by the
Forum of Politics who find new
topics and turn them into the com-
mittee. Also a radio script group
composed of Albany business women
is working under the direction of
the committee.
Definite Sewing Schedule

A definite schedule has been ar-
ranged for sewing work. Students
who are willing to contribute their
services may sign up for any hour at
which they want to work. Room 107
will be open every day from 9 A. M.
to 5 P. M. There is an urgent de-
mand for students who will donate
their time to this type of work ac-
cording to a statement made by
Miss Sara T. DeLaney. Dean of
Women. A person need not be skilled
in sewing for there are different
kinds of work to accommodate all.

Notices posted in the halls and
rooms of the college publicize the
work of War Activities Council. In
the near future a huge directory will
be placed in the Rotunda telling
about the various defense activities,
the supervisors of the activities and
their offices. and the rooms where
defense work will be carried on. A
list of air-raid precautions compil-
ed by Dr. Louis Jones is published
in today‘s Nuws.

new season with offerings directed
by Jane Curtis and Betty Borden,
juniors. The two plays, which repre-
sent two entirely different types of
drama, will be presented next Tues-
day night, February 24, in the Page
Hall auditorium.

Miss Curtis’ play tells a romantic
story, of a girl in whose veins runs
the wild blood of a gypsy mother,
who married a gentleman. The scene
is laid in Roumania. The girl pos-
sesses all the mother’s fire and none
of the father’s conventionality, The
conflict between the father's will
and the daughter’s spirit is the
theme of the play. Morris Gerber

Miss Borden will stage an expres-
sionistic tragedy. Her cast includes
Doris Lichtwart. Harold Ashworth,
Arthur Soderlind and Robert
Loucks, sophomores. and John Lu-

lege students who were chosen by
the art editor as typli'ying the mod-
ern collegiun. Normal schools and
teachers’ colleges throughout the
state have submitted their pictures
to Dr. DoBell who will assemble
them to complete the survey of col-
lege activities.

Every aspect of teacher training
has been considered—the intellec-

 

tunl, showing classroom scenes, con-
ferences with supervisors. and prac—
tice teaching; the healthful, illus-
l.l'ill.lll}_; the hygienic facilities and
precautions of the modern teacher
training Institution; the creative
and aesthetic, dealing with music,
dranmtics. and art; and lastly, the
recreational, concerning sports. bull
sessions, and night life.

Although photography has been a
hobby of Dr. DoBell’s for only three
years, his exhibits, which are fre-
quently sponsored by the art de-
partment, illustrate an unusual tal-
ent, ranking him for above the
average amateur. In the game room
of his Delmar home he likes noth-
ing better than to spend his eve-
nings mixing chemicals, and remov—
ing negatives from the "soup." He
believes that it is necessary for the
amateur photographer who has a

conscientious desire to improve his
work to do his own printing and
enlarging. “He knows the effect he
wishes." Dr. DoBell explains, “and
can obtain it better than any cam-
era shop."

Posing the models himself, he
placed floodlights in various posi-
tions to obtain special highlights
that accentuate the features and
"round the face." Dr. DoBcll strove
for a picture story in which expres‘
sion, position. background, and
lighting were unified before he
snapped the shutter. “I never trust
to luck," said Dr. DoBell. “It never
Works."

“I wish to thank all the models
who worked with me," said Dr. Do-
Bell, “for their punctuality, pa-
titence, and willingness to cooper-

Students May Omit
Year by Attendance

At Summer Sessions

By Gordon Baskln

In 1917 the Board of Regents de-
cided to institute a summer ses-
sion in the State College curriculum
to shorten the time required to com-
plete scheduled courses. Twenty-
five years later,‘ in 1942, the United
States is again embroiled in war,
but now the decision has been left
to the class of 1945.

Last Monday during the newly
formed Orientation class, Dr. Milton
G. Nelson, Dean of the College,
presented the plan suggested by the
New York State Board of Regents
——a plan in which the present fresh.-
men and succeeding classes will be
able to complete the four year
course required for the Bachelor of
Arts degree in three years. By at-
tending a third semester during
July and August for three consecu-
tive summers, the student will thus
eliminate his Junior year.

Graduate Work Required

It must be remembered that al-
though the customary time require-
ment for the Bachelor of Arts de-
gree would be reduced. the five-year
or graduate work plan would still
be in effect. The student must com-
plete his graduate work in addition
to the proposed method, thus in ef-
fect shortening the five-year plan to
four years.

Because the sophomore and pre-
ceciing classes have already lost one
or more summer intervals, no plan
can be evolved to graduate them
earlier.

Credit Hours Explained

One hundred and twenty-four
credit hours must be earned to re-
ceive the AB. degree. During the
normal college term, from Septem-
ber to Julie, thirty-two credit hours
may be compiled by the student. Ac-
cording to the proposed plan, ten
credit hours may be obtained in
each of the three summers following
the freshman, sophomore and sen-
ior years. In all. ninety-six credit
hours are earned during the three
regular years, and thirty additional
credit hours in the three summer
sessions. Thus 126 credit hours may
