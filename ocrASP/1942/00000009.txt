Eagle will be pitted against Eagle
tonight when State meets the Pur-
ple Eagles of Niagara University on
the Page court.

Niagara's squad boasts nine vet-
erans, four of these have played
varsity ball for three years. Coach
Gallagher’s Eagles are drawing near
to the end of a very successful
twenty-two game schedule and
seem headed for another Little
Three title in Western New York.

Niagara Powerful

State fans will remember two of
Niagara’s latest victims, St. Law-
rence University and Clarkson Tech.
Last weekend these teams suc-
cumbed to the Purple Eagles by
scores of 50-30 and 56-37 respec-
tively. state has lost two games to
Clarkson and split a pair with St.
Lawrence this year.

The last time State played Ni-
agara was during the 1939-40 season
when State’s Eagles won a thrilling
51-50 victory. Some of the boys who
played with the Niagara team in
that game will be back tonight.
Co-captains William Owens and
James Sheridan are tw0 of these.

State Drops Two

The State basketeers made a dis-
astrous trip to the big city over the
past weekend. The team lost to
Brooklyn Poly on Friday night by a
score of 44 to 29 and repeated its
performance Saturday night by los-
ing to Pratt Institute, 58-48.

The Albany boys were unable to
accustom themselves to the baskets
and steadily fell behind the fast
Brooklyn team. Walsh, one of
Poly’s fastest men, led the scoring
with twelve points. Heffernan di-
rected the ﬂoor-play and contrib-
uted seven points for the winners.

Pratt Has Height

Pratt’s height advantage and su-
perior physical condition won the
game Saturday. The scores at the
ends of the quarters tell almost the
whole story. At the. quarter it was
12-12, at the half it was 23-23, at
the three-quarter mark it was 40-
35, at the ﬁnal whistle it was 58-48.
Brauner's 14 points, Feeney’s 10
points, and Marsland’s 9 points led
the State attack.

WAA Fencers To Be
Hosts to Troy Team

Tomorrow afternoon at 2 P. M.
the WAA fencing class will play
host to fifteen cadets from La Salle
Institute in Troy in the Page Hall

in.
gyThe undefeated La Salle fencing
team will put on an exhibition for
the members of State's fencing class.
Later, fifteen co-eds will clash foils
with the visitors in a friendly ex-
change of the fine points of fenc-
ing. “No competitive match is in-
tended,” says Teddy Jay, captain.

The race for the championship of
the Intramural Basketball League
has developed into a. battle between
College House and Potter Club.
Both squads are tied for top posi-

' tion, at this writing, with eight wins

against a lone defeat.

Last week Sigma Lambda Sigma
was removed from a probable
chance at ﬁrst position when it
dropped a close 16-15 decision to
the unpredictable Ramblers. Hal

with thirty seconds remaining, to
give the commuters the lead and

Potter Club walloped the Thomas

In Final Period

Meet Albany Academy
On Home Court Tonight

The scarlet tanagers missed their
second win of the season by one
point as Delhi edged out a 40-39
victory over them last Friday. Only
when the final whistle blew was the
outcome of the game decided.

Starting out at a fast pace, the
Fresh gained an edge over the Ag-
gies in the opening minutes of the
game. Delhi’s shift from a zone to
a man to man defense slowed down
the tanagers' offense, giving Delhi
a 11-9 lead at the end of the ﬁrst
period.

The second stanza found the
yearlings hitting the hoops again as
they went out in front by a 21-20
score. Once more the Aggies came
back to lead 31-28 at the end of the
third quarter.

With ten seconds to play in the
game, Delhi leading 39-38, a dou-
ble foul was called on Buck Hip-
pick and Jack McArdie. Since this
foul put Hippick out of the game,
Frank Woodworth came in to shoot
Buck’s foul. Woodworth's sinking
of this foul shot tied the score at
39 all, but McArdle made his, also,
putting Delhi out in front again.

With not enough time for the
Fresh to score again this score, 40-
39, decided the game.

Tonight at 7 P. M. the Fresh hope
to avenge their previous loss to A1-
bany Academy. With the advan-
tage of being on their home court
the Fresh should provide Academy
very stiff competition tonight if
they play the fast brand of basket-
ball they displayed a week ago.

Dorm A Takes Top Spot;
As Newman Hell Loses

Dorm A established themselves in
ﬁrst place Wednesday afternoon
when they defeated Newman Hall
17-14. Domann, LaSaile, and Herd-
man made an unbeatable trio de-

. spite the ample guarding of the

Newman Hall six. Newman made
the ending spectacular by two quick
baskets, but Dorm A soon recovered.

Moreland tromped over the Com-
muter B team 14-3 to make up for
their last week’s defeat. The Com-
muters lacked teamwork and co-
operation. Commuters A forfeited
to Junipers Wednesday afternoon.

Wednesday night in an exciting
double header, Dorm B beat the
Cooper House team 15-9, and Dorm

'C whipped North-Western 22-16.

Dorm B had a deﬁnite edge on the
Cooper House girls because of their
accurate shots. Cooper plays a very
fast, spectacular game, but their
shots were not accurate. Rock-
castle, the only senior on the Dorm
B team, made eight of the 15 points,
and formed the backbone of the
team.

The Dorm C-North-Western game
ran for a four minute overtime
period to decide the winner. The
girls played hard and exciting for 30
minutes.

The match was a tie, with Gamma

CARL MITCHELL

Tonight’s resumption of combat:
with Niagara University marks the
peak in the present season of well-
known opponents.

The game this evening brings
back memories of the hard-fought
contest just two years ago. Many of
the present senior and junior class
sports fans will recall how a decid-
edly underdog State squad suddenly
pulled out the throttle and steamed
ahead in the closing seconds of the
game. The score was 51-50 in our
favor as the ﬁnal whistle blew. At.
almost the same instant, a Niagara
forward let ﬂy with a long-range
throw that found its mark with
deadly accuracy—but a split second
too late.

So hard hit were the representa-
tives of mightly Niagara that tears
were shed by members of the team.
Tears from athletes. Tears con-
vincingly indicative of the ﬁne spirit
of play instilled in veteran players.
Although the occasion was not a.
happy one for the visitors, it never-
theless gladdened our hearts to be-
hold the evidence displayed by
sincere hard-scrapping lads who
held victory as a cherished goal.

We would suggest that every fan
who wants to seea major college
tilt .attend tonight’s tournament.
It's true that we have not had too
successful a. season this year. But
the breaks just haven't been in
State’s favor.

Whether State wins or loses this
game is sure to provide the maxi-
mum in speed and thrills. State
realizes that it is at a disadvantage
from the start but that has never
deterred the local athletes from
fighting with all the stamina they
could muster. Perhaps if State re-
peats with another win we can say,
“Remember Niagara Falls!"

COLLEGE BUILDINGS TO CLOSE EARLY

 

College Activities
Budget Must Take
Ten Per Cent Cut

Finance Board Reports
Paid Taxes 100 Short

The impending budget cut has
ﬁnally arrived. Different extra-cur-
ricular organizations have just been
notified by Robert Bartman, ’43,
member of the Finance Board, as to
tilt; nature and the extent of their
cu .

The budget cut was necessitated
by the fact that this year's budget
was based on the sale of 1000 student
tax tickets. and that only 900 or so
tax tickets were actually sold. At
the present time there are only 960
students, including graduates, en-
rolled in the college, as compared
to the 1025 enrolled in September.
This decrease entailed the payment
of $455 to the 65 students leaving
school who had already bought their
student tax. ,

Loomcd Since September

The cut has loomed since early
in September when it was seen that
a 100% sale of tax tickets could not
possibly be expected. The cut, made
just recently, was made on a pro
rata basis, that is, according to the
percent of the total amount of
money that each activity receives
from the whole; the cut this time
amounts to about at 10% decrease
from the appropriation in the bud-
get made out and passed in one of
last year’s assemblies.

Although the inﬁrmary fund and
the Pedagogue received cuts, this
does not tell the whole story; both
of these organizations obtain a cer-
tain amount of money from each
tax ticket sold; the infirmary fund
receives $3 from every tax ticket
and the Pcdagogue $1.

Some Can Take No Cut

Appropriations of a few of the
organizations, such as the Freshmen
Handbook, could not be reduced be-
cause the money had already been
spent.

Following are the cuts that each
organization had to take:

Saturda anheon Will Wind Up Festivities

Junior Prom, with all its regal
sparkle and splendor, is slated for
tonight at the Aurania Club where
Don Redman and his orchestra,
opening to the strains of Chant of
the Weed, will play from 10 P. M. to
2 A. M. Bids were lowered this year
to $2.75 and will be on sale this
af'.crnoon in the lower hail, of
Draper until 4 P. M. and at the
Auranla Club tonight. According
to Mildred Mattice, general chair-
man, the sale of bids has proceeded
very successfully.

“Junior Week" is no longer as
important as it was once. Formerly,
on the first week of second semes-
ter, the Junior class took charge
of college activities, beginning with
the chapel services on Wednesday.
This was followed by a Thursday
reception to which all students were
invited, but was later replaced by a
"Tea Dance.” The weekend was
completed by a Prom on Friday and
a Banquet Saturday afternoon.

Recalls World War I

During the years of World War I,
patriotic themes and "Eatless Ban-
quets” were the order of the day.
"The Junior Banquet," declared the
1918 News, “owing to the exigencies
of the times, conﬁned its menu to
ice cream and cake. There were no
limitations set upon the fun, how-
ever." The situation is somewhat
similar today. Because of the war
emergency, the Junior Tea was
dropped from the program.

This year at the stroke of midnight,
Queen Duff (Marion Duffy, ’42) will
place the coveted crown on the head
of her successor. The five candi-
dates, nominatcd by the Junior
class two weeks ago, are: Dorothy
Cox, Shirley Eastman, Mildred Mat-
ticc, .lunc Melville, and Marilynn
Rich.

Winding up the weekend is the
Junior Luncheon, to be held at
Jack's Restaurant, Saturday, Febru-
ary 21. The price is $.85 and each
Junior may bring an outside guest.
The speaker is Dr. Shields Mac-
Iiwaine, Professor of English. Jun-
lore may sign up at the bid table
in the lower hail of Draper.

Chapcrones and Committees

Chnporoncs for the Junior Prom
are: Dr. D. V. Smith, Professor of
Social Studies, and Mrs. Smith, Dr.
Howard DoBeii, Professor of
Mathcnmtics, and Mrs. DoBell. Dr.
