This series of photographs show the execution of a problem in fire direction center by the Field

-where cigarettes are iudged

The "T- ZONE"—'l'ttste and Throat—is the proving ground for
cigarettes. Only your unite and throat can decide which cigarette
tastes best to you . . . and how it aliens your throat. For your taste
and throat are absolutely individqu to you. Based on the expe-
Home of millions of smokers, we believe Camels will suit your
"T-ZONE" to at "T." Prove it for yourself!
