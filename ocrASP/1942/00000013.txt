Stat, bursts through the tape to click off his 58th straight triumph by winning the
Bfllmgs two-mile event in the annual Boston Athletic Association’s Indoor Meet.

The inevitable final blow to Joe College, the playboy, 'was
dealt on the campus of the University of Oregon where a
new, effective system of enforcing scholarship and cutting
down on social life was initiated. Self-imposed by the
students, the idea puts dates with coeds on the some basis
as sugar, gasoline, etc. . . . rationed. The idea started in
a "bull session” at the Sigma Phi Epsilon fraternity house,
clicked, was adopted for the entire campus and now is
spreading to other institutions.

Here’s how it works: An "office of date administration”
is set up with all the machinery to carry on a rigid ra-
tioning program. Bona fide ration books bear the person’s
identification, his record, and a specified number of cou-
pons, according to his scholastic standing. Books must be
presented to a representative in each house who clips 0
coupon before the bearer is allowed to leave on a date.
ODA has a “secret” police force, with many co-eds serv-

board, made up of representatives from various fraternities, has announced a strict policy of en-
forcing its rules. Like most rationing, there _is plenty of red tape involved.
