Way back in 1939 A.D.. State Col-
lege was blitzkricd by a not-too-
vcrdant freshman class which im-
mediately started to revolutionize

tripped the light fantastic to waltzes
and sometimes in more radical
moods. indulged in an occasional
fox-trot, It took the upstarts of '43
to lift the Commons roof daily with
a now Lindy craze which caused
conscrv.itivc upper—classmcn to re-
sort to a policy of “watchful wait-
ing" on the balcony. A disgruntled
junior oftcn wcnt so far as to stig-
