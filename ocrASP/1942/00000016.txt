Forum to Discuss
Strategy of War

. Speakers to Give Topics
Having Current Interest

A meeting of the Forum on Tues-
day, February 24, at 3:30 P. M. in
the Lounge will feature a round
table discussion on “The Stuff of
War.” Taking part in the discus-
sion will be chairman, Frederick
Ferris, ’42; Janet Weitzer, ’42; Rob-
ert Bartman, Rita Ferraro, Clarice
Weeks, and Mae Whiting, Juniors.

The topics for consideration in-
clude oil, food, industrial capacity,
shipping, and natural resources.
Each speaker will attempt to pre-
sent the facts and apply their sig-
niﬁcance to the current strategy of
the war.

Included in the program will be
a brief report by Marilyn Eber, '45,
on William Shirer’s Berlin Diary.
She will augment her review with
references to his lecture delivered
recently in Albany. Also, Beatrice
Hirsch, '42, chairman of CWAC
radio research squad, will give an
up-to-the-minute review of the
squad's work.

A committee to assist the radio
research branch of the State Col-
lege War Activities Council has
been organized by Forum. This com-
mittee will serve as an agency to
suggest new topics and conduct re-
search on the attested topics. Mi-
chael Perretta, '43, is chairman of a
committee which is conducting a
detailed research into the economic
and military importance of the
lords of the South Paciﬁc.

College Buildings—

(Continued from Page 1, column 3)

Since the Library is constructed
in part of glass which makes it
extremely dangerous, it was thought
advisable to close the building at
(i P. M. from Monday to Friday.
Saturday hours will remain as
usual. To compensate for the loss
in Library hours, reserve books will
now circulate each night from 4:30
P. M. to 9 A. M. the next morning.
The same rules and ﬁnes now in
force concerning the use of reserve
books over extended college vaca-
tions will apply. Reserve books may
be taken from the library over the
weekends beginning Friday at 4:30
P. M. except that at least one copy
of each book must remain in the
library for Saturday reading. If a
book is in use between 4:30 P. M.
and 6 P. M. it cannot be taken out
until the person using it is finished.
Additional details will be posted in
the Library.

The college athletic program must
undergo a change also, since the
gym has been declared unsafe by
defense officials. Coach G. Elliot
Hatﬁeld has announced that the
State-StMichael basketball game,
originally scheduled for Friday eve-
ning. has been moved forward to
Thursday at 4:30 P. M. The inter-
mural program has also been modi~
i‘icd. For details see the sports page.

Administration officials voiced the
hope that financial aid to provide
for better blackout arrangements
can be arranged after the beginning
of the next ﬁscal year.

Faculty Hiking, Drinking Gallons of Milk, Rising Early;
All in Training For Coming Myskania Basketball Game

The State College Faculty no
longer has to patronize drug stores
for its sparkling eyes and rosy
cheeks. They’ve gone in training
with a vengeance. Four mile hikes,
gallons of milk, abstinence from nic-
otine, and early
(in the morning)
hours are the
fashion on the
faculty nowadays.

The cause for
this reformation ?
Well. Myskania
had a brainstorm
again and it blew
up into a basket-
ball game. So, now
seven members of
the society with
Paul Merritt as
coach are getting
a line on seven
faculty members
who will crash
with them on the
“Ides of March."
with the Red
Cross on the win-
ning end (ﬁnan-
cially speaking).

At this early .. 
date, the outcome  
of the melee is
uncertain, in spite of the fact that
each side is conﬁdent (outwardly, at
least) that it can easily walk off with
the victory. Paul Bulger. who gave
up cigarettes at the age of 14 be—
cause he foresaw this great oppor-
tunity, believes that frequent sub-
stitutions will wear the Myskania
team down. And he believes. “Bas-
ketball is merely a matter of preven-
tion, preventing your opponents from

making baskets and preventing them
from preventing you from making
baskets.” Bulger intends to play the
position of bottleneck for Passow.
“We’ll kill ’em," was the ferocious
comment of Kooman Boycheif as he

Eldred Deplores
Education Budget

“New York State education must
have full state aid l We’re right he-
hind President Saylcs to keep State
College from a starvation budget."
declared Dr. Arvie Eldred. Execu-
tive Secretary of the New York State
Teacher’s Association. in last Fri-
day's assembly.

purpose of the teachers' association.
Dr. Eldred traced the development

day with its problems of rural edu-
cation and stole aid.

Dr. Eldred explained that the aim
and purpose of the organization to
give equal education to children in
the whole state may be attained
only by having well-qualiﬁed leach-
crs. Dr. A. R. lil‘libilt‘liiﬂ', lute Presi—
dent of the college, was it leader in
the tencher—weli’nre movement still
an important question today.

Almost every teacher in New York
State belongs to the association and
membership is open to students in
teacher-training institutions also.
“We know you're getting better
training than you ever had,” said
Dr. Eldred. “We want you to take
over."

 

clutched his bottle of milk. Boy-
cheff's been in training all year,
according to himself, so he doesn’t
have to reorganize his schedule to
get ﬁt for the game. Ralph Baker,
rushing home to don his running
tights, declared
that “Dr. Reinow
and I do four
miles of cross-
country every
day.” (When told
of this. Dr. Rei-
now looked slight-
ly amazed.) Anew
technique for the
faculty is what
Dr. Baker advo-
cates. “And the
faculty will win,
but deﬁnitely l"

And maybe the
faculty’s right.
They’ve got a
semi - professional
among them. Rob-
ert Reinow played
his last game 12
years ago and he’s
going to play his
rules. His own
idea of agood bas-
ketball game is,
“To do anything
to get the ball,” and he's deﬁnitely
in favor of his own type of “wind-
less" basketball (meaning just what
it implies). The fact that Rienow is
in the social studies department
probably accounts for his suggestion
that the referee be chosen demo-
cratically, by election. Reinow is
positive that the faculty will win;
but he added. “After all. it’s a ques-
tion of who is worse."

Juniors Introduce

'Lindying Cruel,
Remain Dignilied

Way back in 1939 A.D., State col-
lege was blitzkried by a not-too-
verdant freshman class which im-
mediately started to revolutionize
State traditions.

For many years, phlegmatic State
tripped the light fantastic to waltzes
and sometimes in more radical
moods, indulged in an occasional
fox-trot. It took the upstarts of ’43
to lift the Commons roof daily with
a new Lindy craze which caused
conservative upper-classmen to re-
sort to a policy of “watchful walt-
ing" on the balcony. A disgruntled
junior often went so far as to sug-
gest compelling the St. Vitus danc-
ers to confine their gymnastics to
the area under the ping-pong table.

The exhausted frosh, still recup-
erating from Freshman Camp, were
required to give their all in render-
ing genius I. Q.’s.

Becomes Dignifled For a Time

Game the combined Junior and
President‘s Reception at which ’43,
amidst hearty welcomes and hand-
shakes, assumed a dignified manner
and put their best hand forward.

The realistic Sophs at their cus-
tomary reception attempted to in-
timidate the fearleSS ’43ers and of-
fered them a choice between heaven
and hell, halo or horns. Although
the reticent frosh refused to com-
mit themselves, they have illustrated
by their model behavior that they
have never once strayed from the
straight and narrow path.

When it came to rivalry, their
president Tom Feeney stated. “The
fresh are ready to take anything in
their stride.” Evidently their stride
was not quite long enough, for on
Moving-up Day a record rivalry
score was obtained—but not in fav-
or of ’43.

Organizes “Black Legion"

But this did not phase the class,
for starting their sophomore year
right, '43 organized the dreaded
Black Legion under their president,
Curley Taylor. The purpose of this
secret-sixteen was to punish diso-
bedient frosh. Just to show that
their heart was in the right place,
however, the benevolent sophs en-
tertained ’44 with lid minstrel show—-
another Black Legion of gags and
gals.

When organized rivalry began, the
sophs displayed their valor and
bowled the freshmen over with a
66-0 pushball score.

The fresh spirit thus daunted. un-
orgmized rivalry proceeded with a
“pantless party" which reached its
climax during assembly in the
midst of a talent show when the
sophs' herculean strength hurled ap-
proximately, 350 pounds of pantless
humanity, vintage ’44. upon the
stage. As the amazed freshmen
gazed down from the balcony at
their helpless clasmates. a crafty
soph clandestinely locked the bal-
cony exits—nothing short of Dean
Nelson's demands could induce the
release by the culprits!

Further illustrating their prece-
dent of individualism, 21 sophomores
