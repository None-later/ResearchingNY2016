STATE COLLEGE NEWS, FRIDAY, FEBRUARY 20, 194!

High in Culture Tests

"Fifty per cent of State College
sophomores (the present Juniors)
ranked as high as the highest 20%
of all the 7724 college students who
took the 1941 National College Soph-
omore General Culture tests last,"
reports Dr. Elizabeth H. Morris,
Professor of Education and Consult-
ing College Psychologist.

That SOT students are representa-
tive of. the general superiority of
students in Teachers’ Colleges, com-
pared with those in all kinds of
higher institutions. is demonstrated
in every section of the General Cul-
ture test. Ninety per cent of State
students made better score than the
lowest 50% of all those who took
the tests. State scores in the history
and literature groups were especially
superior according to Dr. Morris’ re-
port.

However. Dr. Morris says, “Even
such gratifying results should be
interpreted with care rather than
seized upon with a complacent feel-
ing of superiority. since SCT stu-
dents are so rigorously selected that
they have a ‘head start’, so to speak."

The median score for men was
somewhat higher on the sub-tests of
current social problems, of history
and social studies, of mathematics,
and of the other sciences and over-
balanced the effect of women’s
superiority in the literature section.
Hence the men were superior in the
total score.

 Stamp Corsages
To Aid in Drive

A campaign to start the sale of
defense stamps on an even larger
scale than heretofore was begun this
week under the supervision of
Rhona Ryan and Trece Aney, sopho-
mores. Posters have been placed
around the college advocating the
buying of defense stamps to be worn
by the college women to the Junior
Prom in place of corsages.

As part of the campaign a box
also will be placed in the publica-
tions office in which students are
urged to put contributions. These
donations will be used to buy defense
stamps and ultimately to purchase a
defense bond, which will be given to
charity. Miss Ryan says, “Instead of
buying a coke or candy bar, give
your spending money to the cause."

As to the wearing of corsages at
the prom, she believes that “State
men have reached rock bottom in
their financial difficulties. and they
might well use their money for
something more worthwhile and
necessary than corsages.”

The campaign leaders suggest the
following ways in which defense
stamps may be worn. Besides wear-
ing them for corsages they may be
used as bracelets and hairbows.

Miss Ryan feels that there has
been a decided indifference on the
part of the State students to do
their part for defense stamps. When
asked where he was buying his cor-
sage. Ed Holstein, ’42, declared, “I'm
buying mine at the co-op."

Pi Gamma Mu Plans
To Amend Constitution

At the meeting of Pi Gamma Mu.
National Honorary Social Studies
Fraternity, held Wednesday at 3:30
P. M.. Fred Ferris, '42, introduced
an amendment to the Pi Gamma Mu
constitution. which will be up for a
three week period before it will be
acted upon.

The proposed amendment would
allow up to eight of the 15 juniors
selected each year for membership
in Pi Gamma Mu to come into the
fraternity at the end of the first
semester. The others would be an-
nounced on Moving-Up Day as is
customary. In addition, the amend-
ment provide for an electorate com-
posed of student and faculty mem-
bers to select the students to be
admitted.

Pi Gamma Mu made plans for a
roller-skating party to be held in
conjunction with the Commerce
Club. The fraternity also planned
for activities to be carried on at
future meetings throughout the se-

master.

ED. Nora: Above is a sample of the sheets distributed by the nutrition
class, one of the defense units. The sheets are used in their study of diets

and menu planning. Test yourself.

 

Students Study Planning of Menus
ln Classes Sponsored by Red Cross

The nutrition classes, sponsored
by the Red Cross, are held every
Tuesday and Wednesday from 7:30
P. M. to 9:30 P. M. A large number
of students and Albany residents are
attending the classes. Miss Margaret
Gentner of Albany High School
teaches the Tuesday night class and
Miss Ruth Goldsmith of Philip
Schuyler High School is in charge of
the class held on Wednesday night.
Room 101 is the headquarters for
the course.

All those people interested in do-
ing canteen work for the Red Cross
must take the nutrition course as a
prerequisite. The course is a ten-
week one and a Red Cross certiﬁ-
cate is awarded at the end of this
period.

A study of food costs is made in
the course, a subject of timely in-
terest considering the high cost of
living existing in war time. To en-
able those enrolled to plan balanced
meals, menu planning is studied.
The students plan actual menus,
using the principles studied in the
adequate diet and nutrition parts
of the course. They are instructed in
the energy value of various foods,
calorie content, and what a properly
balanced and nutritive menu should
be. Tests are given to determine the
progress of the students.

Those already engaged in Red
Cross canteen work are being sent to
take the nutrition course.

Both Miss Gentner and Miss Gold-
smith are making extensive plans
for the ensuing weeks of the course.
They are both very interested in
presenting valuable and useful in-
formation that will be practicable in
homes, group houses and the Red
Cross.

The State College Trio, consisting
of Ruth Moldover and Bernard
Perlman, seniors, and Jane South-
wick, ‘44, and a portion of the
Operatic Society presented a half-
hour program over Station WABY
from 4 P. M. to 4:30 P. M. on Mon-
day. Selections from The Pirates of
Pcnzance, Gilbert and Sullivan op-
crretta to be presented this year,
were given.

Jean McAllister, '43, song Poor

nounced.

 

Sewing Circle Complains;
Stale Seamsfresses Slacken

“We need more girls," is an
unusual cry at State, but Sarah
Beard, '42, student director of
the College Red Cross sewing
group, adds, “our present work
is piling up and new work is
rapidly increasing."

Madeleine Fagan, '42, rolled
up her sleeves, sat down at vari-
ous times, and completed more
than twelve hours of stitching.
Runners up who have reached
the ten hour mark are Mary
Carpenter, Elizabeth Gilmore,
and Rita Kell, seniors; Kath—
erine Cousins, Jane Greenmun,
Shirley Jennings, and Barbara
Kerlin, juniors; and Patricia
Frey and Virginia Armbrust,
sophomores.

After ﬁve months it is passe to
refer to the class of ’45 as ver-
dant; so “Where, oh where are
the lazy freshman ?" Upper
classmen are asked to come out
of hiding too.

 

Kappa Phi Kappa Meets

At a meeting of Kappa Phi Kappa.
Wednesday, February 18, Dr. Arthur
Beik, Professor of Education, spoke
on the trends in the use of psychol-
ogy in the armed forces. He gave
some of the more general aspects of
the newer phases of psychology.

Defense Council
Explains College
War Activities

Systematization Planned

To Coordinate Work

The committees working on na-
tional defense at State College feel
that the students should be better
acquainted with the actual organi-
zation of the college war activities.

The entire defense organization
centers around a War Activities
Council. Plans drawn up recently
have systematized the work of this
council.

The College Defense Organization
provides for a central coordinating
body which makes general plans to
do what needs to be done and ap-
points people to do the job. There
must also be people to direct volun-
teer workers. Thirdiy an efficient
publicity program to summon volun-
teer energy and educate the students
to war needs is needed.

Extensive Program Working

The War Activities Council has
organized defense classes, a United
Book Campaign, sewing activities, a
salvage campaign, and issued air
raid precautions. The problem of
finances for defense work, of blood
donations to worthy causes. and of
complete blackouts and curtailing
of night activities at the college are
now at hand.

The publicity part of the program
revolves around Room 207, where at
2:30 P. M. on Monday, all phases of
defense work submit written reports
for publicity purposes, which goes
to Press Bureau, to postermaking
organizations, and for assembly an-
nouncements and News publication.
Heads of Activities

The following are in charge of
various phases of the war work:
Miss Sara T. DeLaney, Dean of
Students, Jean Sears and Bernard
Perlman, seniors. in charge of De-
fense Course organization; Dr. Louis
Jones, Instructor in English, Dr.
Robert Rienow, Assistant Professor
of Social Studies, and Dr. William
Hartley, Assistant Professor of Edu-
cation, in charge of radio script
work; Dr. Louis Jones, in charge of
air raid precautions work; Dr. Rob-
ert Rienow and Edwin Holstein, ’42.
in charge of publicity; Mr. Adam
Walker, Professor of Economics and
Sociology. and June Bantham, '44,
in charge of salvage; Mrs. Anna
Barsam, Supervisor of Home Eco-
nomics in Milne, Mrs. Dirk Tieszen,
and Sally Beard, ’42, in charge of
Red Cross sewing; Miss Ruth
Hutchins, Assistant Professor of Art,
Miss Grace Martin and Miss Ruth
Suhrie, Instructors in Art, and Rita
Hickey. '43, in charge of poster work.

Students who are interested in any
of these activities should immedi-
ately contact those persons who are
directing the work.

Mrs. RoosevellL Emphasizes Role
Youth Must Ploy During Crisis

by Rita Hickey
“The youth must win the war,"
repeated Mrs. Franklin Roosevelt in
a Schenectady speech last Friday

 

Mrs. Franklin D. Roosevelt

night. She emphasised particularly
the role of youth not only in the
war but in the peace to follow. Lead—

ers must be developed to help rebuild
the new world that is to follow.

In the reception room before her
talk, Mrs. Roosevelt’s head could be
seen above all the others in her
party. She was entirely in black,
the broad brim of her hat was up
on the side and swept forward in
front. Her dress was relieved by ver
little color. so that her huge orcﬁTd
corsage was very noticeable. Her
conversational tone is low and pleas-
ant. and her handshake was as firm
as a man's.

Her speech covered all the aspects
of defense. She seemed greatly con-
cerned over the hoarding of sugar
when the armed forces. especially the
pilots patrolling the coast, have only
twenty seconds to get out of their
cracked-up planes. Laughter rip-
pled through the audience when she
mentioned England's concern over
recreation, “especially dancing. all
kinds of dancing."

She expressed confidence in ulti—
mate victory if the people realize
that thzy must sacrifice not only a
quarter of a pound of sugar a week,
but many other articles that have
been thought of as necessities.

A community spirit of helping
one's neighbor, of sharing together
supplies as well as sorrows will have
to be developed if America is to win
the war, concluded Mrs. Roosevelt.

Make Self-Murder Easy

by Kay Doran

Suicide has been universally de-
ﬁned as the intentional taking of
one's own life or self-murder. One
of the most effective means to “end
it all" is to jump off the Brooklyn
Bridge with a rope around one’s
neck, a gun in one hand, a knife in
the other, first being careful to swal-
low some arsenic. But even this
method is not sure-fire as compared
with the various opportunities for
such an act as exist around State.

For those who are planing to
plunge from the heights of the State
Office Building, there is really no
need to exhaust oneself climbing 38
stories before the supreme effort;
may it be suggested that these dis-
illusioned individuals merely ascend
the ninety degree angle of the Li-
brary stairs being careful to keep
eyes bashfully below “see level."
Once at the top proceed to walk
painstakingly downward. A quick
and easy death is assured, for before
descending two steps, a spike heel
or size 12 shoe, as the case may be,
will inevitably slip to send them
sprawling, while the stooges climb
over the prostrate form. This method
is not advisable for those whose
chasses are a bit on the adipose side.
The width of the stairs would keep
them suspended indeﬁnitely, there-
by holding up considerable traffic.

Showering Fountains

Then there is always poison for
the weary State student who wishes
a long vacation as a result of the
crowded exam schedule. To.these
misguided but determined shadows
of their former selves, it is advisable
to use the method which requires
the least exertion. For their conven-
ience, drinking fountains have been
evenly distributed about the College.
A twist of the wrist is all that is
needed to turn on the faucet, and if
they manage to escape drowning
from the convulsive upsurge of
water capable of extinguishing the
fire on the Normandle. they may
quietly succumb after one sip of the
lukewarm water.

Many would-be suicides have no
doubt given profound consideration
to employing asphyxiation as a
peaceful passing-away process. Al-
though the Science majors have
been strengthened to overcome the
aroma of such incompatible chemi-
cals as sulphur and hydrogen, the
average inexperienced student can-
not pass through the corridors of
Huested without stopping at the
Recovery room. To those students
who do not own a car i and there is
reason to believe that they do not)
let them merely take a slow prome-
nade through Huested sans gas
mask.

"Horrors of Huested”

Among the “horrors of Huested"
is the much talked of “guillotine”
door, which “slaps you down” when
you are and aren’t looking. If‘ they
are still determined to continue their
fatal plan (and if they have man-
aged to live through all previous
attemptsi this door remains as a
way out (in more ways than one).
On the day set for the event, they
must fail to Wear a suit of armor,
and merely push. or rather break
open the door. Once open, it
will boomerang in their face causing
everything to go black~and blue.
The whole summary of the afore-
mentioned is, “It ain't watcha do.
its the way howya do it."

Lafesf Decree Blocks Oul
l-M Basketball Schedule

Most recent blackout orders
decreeing that the college shall
be locked up at seven o'clock
every night nfi'eets State’s sports
program in a number of ways.
The intramural basketball games
scheduled for evenings will have
to be cancelled. It has been sug-
gested that the remainder of the
schedule be cancelled and that
College House and Potter Club
play oﬂ‘ for the championship.

Intramural Council has not
had time to decide upon changes,
if' any are necessary, but it
looks as though the spring sports
schedule will remain intact. An
afternoon volleyball program
may he started as soon as varsity
basketball is finished.

Coach Hatfield has already
arranged to have the varsity’s
game with St. Michael moved up
to 4:30 P. M. on Thursday, Feb-
ruary 26.

State Hoopsters
Drop Niagara Tilt

Varsity idle This Week;
Only Two Games Remain

State's Eagles continued their
nosedive last Friday when they lost
their seventh game of the season to
the high-flying Purple Eagles of
Niagara. 51 to 25.

The outcome of the game was
never in doubt as Niagara took the
lead after the first minute of play
and continued to lengthen this ad-
vantage throughout the game.

State's starting lineup consisted
of frauner. Marsland, Hansen,
Young, and F‘eeney. Co-captain
Dill Dickson did not start the game
because of an ankle injury sus-
tuincd in the Pratt game.

Niagara, displaying plenty of
height and power to burn. took the
lead after the first minute. The
first quarter of the game was not
long under way before Bill Mars-
lund was penalized three times for
[JCI’Si’lldl fouls. Marsland usually
commits very few fouls in a contest.
Couch Hatfield sent in a substitute
for Marsland at this point.

Rich Young played a bang-up
game and earned the applause oi
the overflowing crowd several times.
Co-cuptuin Hank Brauner, State's
leading scorer, was completely
shackled and was able to score only
one point.

Led by their lanky center Gruns-
woig, who scored 10 points for the
game. the invading Purple Eagles
led at halftime 20-10. Both teams
substituted freely in the final quar-
ter us Niagara coasted to its twelfth
victory. This win avenged the game
which the Purple Eagles lost to
State two years ago by a 51 to 50
score.

State's buskctccrs have two games
left. Next Thursday they will en-
gage the powerful St. Michael quin-
tcl on the Page court. and on March
7 they will play their traditional
game with the alumni.

Potter Club Takes
Hall-game Lead
in l-M Basketball

Emerging victorious in its two
contests this week, Potter Club re-
sumed the leadership of the Intra-
mural basketball league. Wins over
the Ramblers and KDR placed the
REF squad one-half game ahead of
its nearest rival, College House, who
also won their lone game of the
week with Sayles Hall.

The Ramblers threw a scare into
the ranks of the league leaders by
starting out strong and obtaining a
12-10 lead at half time. However, the
close checking of the Potter lads
stopped the commuters cold while
EEP pulled ahead to win 23-16.
Reed and Hammond scored ten and
nine points respectively for the win-
ners.

Potter Tops KDR

In the KDR contest, Potter Club
was also trailing at intermission
9-8. However, Potter was again
able to come through with a victory
as Ed Reed sank a pop shot in the
final minute to give EEP a two
point edge.

little trouble in scoring over Sayles
Hall. Although Secly scored 11
points for the losers, Sayles was
rarely within striking distance and
lost 25-18.

Previous to their defeat to Potter,
KDR scored handily to defeat the
hapless Thomas More squad. The
cellar dweller's attack could not
function, while Stone and Graves
threw in 15 and 12 points respec-
tively to lead KDR to a decisive 36-
17 victory.

Jordan Scores 21

SLS defeated their back door
neighbors from the men’s dorm by
a score of 38—27. Jordan led the
winners attack by flipping in eight
baskets in the first half and adding
five more points in the second stan—
za for a total of 21. Gipp contrib-
uted 15 counters to the losing cause
of Sayles Hall.

In the first overtime game of the
intramural season, Kappa Beta
finally defeated Sayles Hall. The
score was 12 all at the end of the
regular playing time; however, led
by Bittman, KB scored six points
to one for Sayles and won 18-13.

Ruback High Scorer
ln l-M Basketball Loop

Due to the many requests received
for a listing of the high individual
scorers in the intramural basketball
league. the records were perused this
week and scores were added. The
result of all this furious activity was
a maze of ﬁgures. which finally
crystallized into the following form.

It must be remembered. in com-
paring the scores, that there is a
variation in the number of games
played by (Neil man.

The standings are:

Orchids

It isn't often that we get the
chance to write exactly what we
feel like saying. And when we do get
the chance . . . . oddly enough . . . .
we don’t know what to say.

The way we figured, it is always
safe to pat a few people on the
back so here goes. Our first mythical
orchid is awarded to the sixty men
who took part in the recently-com-
pleted intramural bowling schedule.
Their enthusiasm definitely showed
that the men want bowling. Let's
hope that there are enough men
left next year to run a bowling
league . . . . or maybe Nora's idea of
co-ed bowling will become a ne-
cesity. Hmmmmm.

A second orchid goes to Potter's
bowling champs. They beat 818 in
the final game of their match to
win another title. To lend variety to
Potter‘s collection of trophies, In-
tramural Council has ordered a
plaque instead of a cup this time.

Our third orchid goes to Thomas
More's spirited basketball team. Al-
though suffering defeat after de-
feat we find them fighting until the
ﬁnal whistle in every game and
never complaining of the outcome.

A final orchid goes to Clarence
Oarr for all the time he has so un-
selfishly given to keeping record of
all intramural bowling scores . . .
you will also note that he has the
high individual average.

P. S. Oarr says that anyone may
check the score sheets if in doubt.

l-M Relereeing

This department hates to be cri-
tical, especially'in its one oppor-
tunity of the year to write a column.
However, conditions in the intra-
mural basketball games have reach-
ed such a state that it is unsafe. at
times, to play basketball.

This precarious situation, the on-
ly blot on the functioning of the
Intramural Basketball League, is
brought upon by the extreme laxness
on the part of some referees. Some
contests have developed into wild
and woolly affairs which are more
appropriate on the football gridiron
than on the basketball court. In
some games less than a half-dozen
fouls were called while five times
that amount were committed. some
openly and willfully.

No Fast Whistle

By this we do not mean that
we advocate the use of a fast
whistle in intramural contests, but
neither do we want the other ex-
treme. Surely .a middle course can
be taken which will provide for a
clean sportsman-like contest.

Rough games are unfair to the
better playing teams when the fouls
are not called. A smooth-working
team is hampered by rough tactics,
and too frequently the referees have
permitted these offenses to contin-
ue for no particular reason, much
to the disguest of the players of
both teams.

Many teams have changed their
style of playing for the worse be-
cause of this overlooking by the
referees, and a poorer brand of bas-
ketball has resulted.

Let us hope that the few remain-
ing intramural games will be mark-
ed with more conscientious referee-
ing.
