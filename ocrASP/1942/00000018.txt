OI Radio Scripts

Students to Participate
In Defense Broadcasts

Radio for victoryl Everyone has
heard a lot about it, but the aver-
age student's conception of just
what it means is a little vague.

The “radio for victory" group
composed of students and Albany
citizens, about one hundred people
in all, writes and produces radio
scripts for the Albany City and
County Defense Office. Most of the
writing is done by the citizens, the
students being occupied for the most
part in research and production.
How Script Is Made

What happens to a script? Mrs.
Frederick B. White, publicity direc-
tor for the Civilian Defense Office,
sends to the radio script committee
a list of subjects that the Defense
Office wants publicized. The com-
mittee decides what angles are to
be stressed and gives this informa-
tion to the research group. These
people collect material through li-
brary work and interviews. At a
weekly meeting the entire script
group is divided into four sections,
with a member of the research and
production committees in each sec-
tion. The research people supply the
facts while the production people
tell how to approach the subject and
what points to stress. Then the
writers go to work. The following
week, all the scripts are turned into
the editorial staff who choose the
best parts from each script to make
up one good script. When it is ap-
proved by the Civilian Defense Of-
ﬁce, the production people put it on
the air.

First Production March 26

The ﬁrst production will be heard
on March 26, the subject being the
library in defense work. The com-
mittee has invented an average fam~
fly, the Victor family, who will ap-
pear in some of the broadcasts.
Actors will be members of the State
College Radio Guild.

Other subjects in various stages of
development are sugar, salvage,
posters in public schools, auto me-
chanics, gardens, blackouts, and
edible weeds.

Dr. Jones stresses the point that
no one person may take credit for
any one broadcast. There are from
ﬁfteen to twenty-five people con-
nected with one program.

though the sophs had no band 12
days before the dance, these new

fully bowed to the freshman class.

Will they return to graduate ?
That is the question foremost in
everyone’s mind as more and more
students substitute army camps for
college (ampuses.

This week a number of State Col-
lege instructors express their opin-
ions on a plan formulated by the
University of Iowa to give ﬁnancial
aid to students who will return to
complete their studies after the war
is over.

The plan at Iowa provides for
gifts of not over $200 to each return-
ing student who needs assistance. A
fund will be collected by voluntary
contributions of 10c a week from
the students still in school, and this
money will be invested in U. S.
Defense Bonds.

The fund is being collected on a
group basis. Presidents of frater-
nities and sororities, leaders of dor-
mitories and such groups, are re-
sponsible for collecting their quotas.

Students who receive the $200 gifts
must have seen at least six months’
service in a U. S. armed force. Also
they must have attended the Uni-
versity of Iowa from October 15, 1940

to the time of induction or enlist-
ment, maintaining graduating grades
during this time.

Dr. Hartley, deﬁnitely enthusiastic
about the plan, declared, “It would
be a good way for us to cooperate
and help those boys who serve the
armed forces and whom we’re going
to need badly as trained leaders
when this war is over." He stated
that it would be a means of helping
both the country (by buying Defense
Bonds) and some of our own friends.

Mrs. Eggleston, also in favor of
the plan, believes that “it is a very
far sighted view of a college problem
which is going to become more and
more pressing," and that it should
also provide for girls who are enter-
ing the army. However she raised
the question, “Suppose the fund were
not large enough to take care of the
number of people who return ?"

Dr. Jones, when approached on the
subject took out his pen and began
to ﬁgure. He estimated that there
would be approximately 900 students
here next year and that this num-
ber could provide a fund of only
$3600. “I don’t believe it would be

economically possible at State," he
said. “It might work at the Univer-
sity of Iowa, but they have 7000 stu-
dents.”

“It’s a little early to march the
boys off to the tune of a pension,”
declared Dr. Rienow when asked to
give his reactions on this idea. "The
motives are admirable but it’s
stretching the truth a little to sug-
gest that such a plan would be a
major factor in improving morale."
As he sees it, something of this kind
will be needed after the war is over,
but he doesn't think we should bribe
the students to come back.

Admitting that there may have to
be some stimuliis to get the boys
back and that the Iowa plan may
have merit in lightening some of the
government's many responsibilities,
Dr. Baker nevertheless questioned
whether such a plan would work.
“Effectiveness will depend much on
the psychological effect of the war
on the individual," he declared. Be-
cause of the uncertainty of the fu-
ture, he agrees with Dr. Rienow that
the plan is a little premature.

 

 

Modern John Paul Jones
Is Milk, Hamburgers Hero

The spirit of '76 came back!
With the aid of 3 quarts of milk
and 4 hamburgers, a State Col-
lege senior became a twentieth
century John Paul Jones.

It all came about when one
nameless ’42-er with a strong
desire to join the navy jour-
neyed to a distant city to take
his physical examination. Much
to our hero’s dismay, he was
found lacking, not flat feet or
high blood pressurewhe was
underweight !

Necessity is the mother of
invention. Our senior consumed
the above-mentioned milk and
hamburgers and dashed back
(pardon us, staggered) to the
recruiting officials.

Again he mounted the scales
—they registered one pound over
the minimum weight——he was
admitted l

Harold Ashworth, Arthur Soderllnd,
Robert Loucks, sophomores, and
John Lubey, '45.

Actors in Miss Curtis’s play, a
romance, are Morris Gerber, Harold

Georgia Hardesty, and Roderick
Fraser, sophomores.

Miss Borden's play is an example
of expressionism, while that to be

conflict of wills.

Council Schedules
Various Debates

Debate Council has released a par-
tial schedule for the second semes-
ter, 1941—42. On March 23, State will
meet Hobart and William Smith at
home. On March 13 some of the
State debaters will engage Colgate
here while others will journey to
New York to meet Columbia,
Queens. Fordham, Rutgers. and New
York University,

The question “What part shall
American foreign policy play in
forming a more workable world or-
der" is the same for all the schedul-
ed debates.

These debates are held in the
farm of panel discussions, and there
are no decisions. The following four
phases of the question will be discus-
sed: causes and difficulties of the.
present world crisis; a revitalized
League of Nations; Pan-American—
ism; and Union Now.

Plans are being made to go to
Syracuse to take part in a panel
discussion on a radio defense pro-
gram. The date has not been set.

 

Newman Slates Bible Quiz

An intellectual battle of the sexes
concerning religion, biblical history,
and morals, in addition to the gen-
eral business meeting, will provide
an unusual program at Newman
Hall on Thursday. February 19, at
7:30 P. M.

 

Men Find Cobwebs, Dust;
Coveted Banner Still Hidden

Two groups of men. crawling
stealthily through subterranean
passages, brushing cobwebs off
their faces, wiggling on their
stomachs through otherwise im-
penetrable holes, lifting dusty
panels in a vain search . . . That
was the sum total of Monday
night's banner rivalry.

Sophomores turned out in a
definite minority to brawl with
the freshmen diligently search-
ing for a. banner they never
found. Lack of enthusiasm was
evident on both sides, despite
class meetings which were ex-
pected to enliven the men of
both classes.

The men didn't even seem
envious of the women's success.

 

 

Increase Seen
In Teaching Jobs,

Reports Bureau

War Emergency Opens
New Teaching Positions

Look at your prospects, State Col-
legel This year's prospects for se-
curing teaching positions look bright.
Last year's deﬁnite increase in calls
is being reemphasized this year, re-
ports Miss Irene Semanek of the
Student Employment Bureau.

Primary reason for more job op-
portunities is of course laid to the
existing emergency. Records indi-
cate that ﬁelds in which men have
specialized will hold more chances
for women teachers, especially sci-
ence, mathematics and commerce.
A deﬁnite shortage of science teach-
ers is anticipated by schools because
of the number of men being drawn
out for selective service. Several of
the selectees have secured instruc-
torships in service branches.

Marriages Withdraw Women

Increase in the number of mar-
riages during war time tends to draw
some women out of the profession.
However SEB has had deﬁnite indi-
cations that a number of schools,
which have had the policy of not
hiring married women, will keep
them on if their husbands are in
service.
Salary liaise Anticipated

A few school principals feel that
they may how to raise the salary
scale to take care of the increased
cost of living. Not as many $1000
and $1100 positions as in the past are
anticipated, although some rural
communities cannot afford to in-
crease the salaries of their teachers.

Miss Semanek said that it is a
little too early to predict absolutely,
but it looks as if the teaching picture
were changing. The war is having a
definite influence on the profession,
and it is feared that it will become
femlnlzed again. The SEB is urging
all service men to keep in touch with
the bureau.

Scholarship Bill
Will Not AIIect

State Students
Lack of Funds Blocks

Passage oi Amendment

by Gravellc and Stench

“State College students will not be
affected by any amendment to the
education law relating to State
scholarships," declared Assembly-
man W. Milmoe, Chairman of the
Committee for Public Instruction, in
an exclusive interview with the
SrA’ru Common News this week. Be-
cause of insufficient funds to pro-
vide for the necessary appropria-
tion, Milmoe's bill proposing the
doubling of State scholarships is no
longer feasible. Had the bill been
passed, students already in posses-
sion of scholarships would receive
$100 for each regular term and the
same amount for slimmer sessions.

“However,” said Assemblyman
Milmoe, “it is generally accepted
that there will be a reapportionment
of scholarships in the case of those
students who complete three terms
in one year instead of the usual two
terms. These students will receive
$50 per term.”

As yet the legislature has not
taken action on the State College
budget. The appropriation for the
fiscal year of 1042 was less than
$200 below that for 1041, but various
college expenses showed a large
enough decrease from those of 1041
to account for an actual increase in
the budget as a whole.

Sayles to Attend
Cornell Meeting

Dr. John M. Saylcs, President of
the College, will attend a two-day
conference at Cornell University
Tuesday and Wednesday, March 2
and 3. This conference will be a
meeting of the Committee on Teach-
er Edueation of the Association of
Colleges and Universities of the
State of New York. Dr. Edmund E.
Day, President of Cornell Univer-
sity, is the chairman of this com-
mittee, and Dr. Sayles is a member.

The main topic for discussion by
this committee will be the arranging
of a reciprocity agreement by which
students in State College, University
of Buffalo, University of Rochester,
Cornell Unlvorsity, Syracuse Univer-
sity, and St. Lawrence University,
who are preparing for trenching ln
secondary schools in the state may.
under certain conditions, take their
graduate work in any one other of
the oforemcntionod colleges.

in order to transfer to one of the
other colleges mentioned above to
complete work for a master's degree,
three conditions would have to be
fulfilled. The student must have
completed satisfactorily the require-
ments for either llnchclor of Science
or Bachelor of" Arts degree, he must
be selected by a faculty connnittce,
and he mum. be rmonmwnded by the
president of his college.

An Editorial

“Keep ’em out” could refer to
the Japs or the Nazis (or pos-
sibly the moths), but it doesn’t.
It is something much easier to
accomplish —— than keeping out
moths, at least. It's the lights

of the college —- the electric
lights, we mean.
President Saylcs has re-

quested that all students coop-
erate in keeping down electric
and gas bills by turning out all
lights when they are the last
persons to leave a room. You
wouldn't leave a ten-dollar bill
to its own devices-4f you had
one, that ins—would you? Well,
that's what you do when you
don't push that switch —» you
leave valuable money wasting
away. And it really doesn’t
cause much wear and tear on
your finger to “push the but-
ton." So, whether you're on the
campus being educated or at
home w recovering from your
education u don't forget ~—— it's
lights out!

i Authorities Plan
To Blackout Gym

Major change in the program to
render Husted and Page Halls usable
at night is the decision to blackout
the gymnasium. Shades will be put
up so games and practices may be
held there after dark.

Following the basketball season,
the blackout provisions will enable
the gym to be used for night dances,
such as are held on Moving-Up Day
night and school formals.

The auditorium has already been
equipped with blackout shades and
is prepared for use during play re-
hearsal and presentations. Dr. Louis
C. Jones, Instructor in English, who
is at the head of the blackout pro-
gram, said that the library ln Haw-
ley Hall would be impossible to
blackout.

All defense classes held at night
will be in Husted Hall. Shades for
the rooms in Busted have rrrived
and will be put up as quickly as
possible.

SEB Committee

Slates Discussions

The plan of the Student Employ-
ment Bureau Committee, headed by
June Haushalter, '42, to keep the
Student Employment Bureau and
the students related, has resulted in
the scheduling of three panel dis-
cussions. The dates of two of these
discussions are, however, tentative.

On Thursday, March 5 at 4:30
PM. in Room 20, Mr. Paul Bulgcr,
and Miss Irene Semanek, Director
and Assistant Director respectively
of the SEB, will meet with seniors
and graduate students in order to
answer and clear up any questions
students may have concerning place-
ment problems. Since the bureau
has asked many questions concern-
ing letters of application, etc., the
techniques of applying for jobs will
be discussed thoroughly. Miss Sem-
unek says that this will be a good
opportunity for clearing up the
things that any of the students are
unsure about.

March 0 is the tentative date set
for a panel discussion of school prin—
cipals. The subject will be the ob-
taining of a position from the ad-
ministrator’s point of view.

March 10 has been set us the ten-
tative date for the report of the
Student Committee on problems of
appearance and interviews.

Action to discontinue baseball as
a varsity sport was taken this week
by MAA Council headed by William
Dickson, '42. Curtailment of the
athletic programs of other colleges
has made this action necessary.

With a shortening of the spring
term only four games could be
scheduled this year. Hamilton, which
was to be our opponent in the ﬁrst
two games has discontinued baseball.
We were to play RPI in the third
game which was scheduled for a
time when RPI was holding exams.
Thus only sophomores would be
available to play and there were not
enough sophomores. The only pos-
sible game would be the fourth one
in which we were to meet Pratt, and
it was thought unwise to sponsor a
baseball season for one game.

Lack of sufficient material and a
10% cut in the MAA budget are fur-
ther reasons for this measure.

Coach Hatﬁeld says: “It is too bad.
We need more than one thing to
afford relaxation for the boys in the
spring athletic program. We will put
more emphasis on tennis but we may
run Into similar trouble there."

William Dickson added in view
of the impracticability of continuing
baseball now MAA Council sincerely
hopes that it will again be an in-
tegral part oi‘ the athletic program
when more favorable conditions
make it possible."
