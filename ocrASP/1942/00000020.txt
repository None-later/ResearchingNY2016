singlet Library Troubles Stud

r',ij[|f:,'Suiier Scholastically, Socially

by Jeanette Shay
Sad are the hearts of many State

' College lads and lasses as they

realize that they can no longer
abandon their lonely roams at night
and go to study in the library in an
atmosphere of "bright'lights" and
activity; that they will no longer
enjoy the beneﬁt of fresh Albany
breezes which always woke them as
they traveled from home to school;
that they will no longer be able to
choose interesting “study” compan-
ions and will have to fall back on
their previously neglected room-
mates. Seriously though, the closing
of the library at night presents a
grave problem to many students as
indicated by comments overheard
during the last two or three days.

Practice. teachers and students
who take subjects requiring a great
deal of research work are most hard
hit. “The only possibility for me is
to get my work done in the day
time," said Arlene Sadler, “because
sometimes I use ﬁfteen or twenty
books at a time. I don't mind the
change except that it will probably
be a strain working all day."
Practice Teachers Hit

“It affects me a lot," declared
Shirley Ott, “because I’m social
studies. I’ll have to study in the
library till 5 P. M. except for the
days I have 8110's and need to catch
up on lost sleep in the afternoons."

According to Joe Levin it’s going to
make those people who have to use
the library try to get their work done
in a shorter time. “Who wants to
carry ﬁve or six reference books
home!" he declared. It’s his opinion
that it is more necessary to provide
black-out curtains for the library
than for the auditorium.

One frequenter of the library ad-
mitted, “It meant quite a bit to me
because I can’t study in the dorm.
Now I have to learn to study all
over again." When asked if she
didn’t mind the movements of people
around her in the library, she said,
“No, in a place like that I can iso-
late myself from everything else.”
Social Advantages Cited

The Cooper House girls advance
as their reason for visiting the li-
brary at night the fact that it's so
near by. “We'll also miss a lot of
the social advantages of coming to
the library, going to the Boul, and
stuff like that," declared Mickey
Adams.

One ambitious young man sug-
gested that the library be opened for
a couple of hours on Sunday after-
noons. George Seifert, however,
says that this won't be necessary
since “in ﬁve or six weeks, it won’t
get dark till about 8:30 anyway, and
the library can stay open until
then.”

Fear that the cost of living in the
dorm will be raised is felt by the far-
sighted Shirley Eastman. “People
used to go to the library and study
two hours. then come home and
have a date," she said. “Now they’ll
just have a date and that will in-
crease the lighting bill in the Ingle."

No matter whether opposed to,
indifferent to, or in favor of the new
measure. most of the State students
realize that it is necessary and they
are willing to rearrange their sched-
ules to make them conform. “It will
be just a matter of time. and we'll be
able to adjust to the situation.” de-
clared Esther Tein.

Canterbury Will Hear
Rev. McNulty at China

An opportunity to hear reports of
situations and conditions In China
as they affect missionary work will
be made possible on March 3 at 6
PM. when Canterbury Club has as
its guest the Reverend Henry A.
McNulty of Soochow. All students
who are interested are invited to at-
tend the supper meeting. which will
be held at St. Andrew’s Rectory.

Reverend McNulty, a missionary
in China for 28 years, is new home
on furlough. Graduated from Prince-
ton in 1895, he entered the General
Theological Seminary and was or-
dained for the ministry.

Though Neglected, Hartley
Plans Myskania Slaughter

Dr. Hartley has been vilely
treated! He was very hurt be-
cause his name was not men-
tioned among the other faculty
members in last' week’s Naws
story on the Faculty-Myskania
basketball game.

He claims that the faculty is
bound to win, for they are em-
ploying a scientiﬁc approach.
They have made charts to map
intricate plays and secured the
aid of Dr. Morris and Miss
Hayes, whose department will be
Statistics—what form of statis-
tics he didn’t say.

Dr. Hartley’s last game was
a faculty-varsity game in which
he declared the varsity stayed
out of school for a week.

Hartley himself will employ
the psychological approach as a
carryover from his ED. 10
classes. When asked what the
psychological approach was, he
declared, “Brass Knuckles!"

 

Can They Bomb
America? - - See

Albany ExhibilL

Can America Be Bombed ? In
answer to this question that is up-
permost in the minds of the Amer-
ican people. the Albany Institute of
History and Art is sponsoring an
exhibit until March 15, which points
out vital facts in regard to airplane
power and the vulnerability of land.

It took 20,000 hours of research
and actual work to construct the
huge exhibit. Models of bombers,
airplane carriers, bombs, and air
bases are chief features of the dis-
play, with everything constructed to
scale. Globe segments are shown
representing “this shrinking world.”
plus charts and maps showing the
gradual decrease in the time neces-
sary to cover speciﬁc distances.

Facts concerning fuel and supply
requirements of bombers are pre-
sented with remarkable clarity. Two
large charts depict the tactical mo-
bility of airplanes and their stra-
tegic immobility. Airplanes need air
bases, advance bases, and advance
depots to refuel and take on supplies.
An actual model of an air base is
displayed, showing clever camou-
ﬂage tactics employed to disguise its
real purpose.

The model bombers shown are the
Douglas B-l9, which can make a
non-stop ﬂight of one-third of the
world, and which cannot take off
from airplane carrier ships, and var-
ious other types of army planes.

A set of pictures shows how ma-
sonry structures are destroyed by
the detonation from falling bombs
by the effect of air pressure, whereas
modern steel and concrete buildings
are less easily damaged.

One of the main attractions of
the exhibit is the large lighted map
showing the chief areas of the
United States that ﬁgure in defense.
Albany is shown as a transportation
center between the Great Lakes,
New England and New York.

Finally, the exhibit answers its
question Can America Be Bombed?.
YES—if control of the sea lanes is
taken from us by the enemy. NO—
lf our navy and the navies of powers
friendly to us control the North
Atlantic. But even more important
is its service to the American public
through the exposition of important
facts about the implements of war
in relation to the area of the earth.

Collegiate Series

Debate Council and the Freshman
Debate Squad have scheduled a ser-
ies of debates in which the State
students will compete with students
from the nearby colleges. Their
topics will consider some phase of
current events.

“Peace—Plans and Prospects For"
forms the basis for two panel discus-
sions here at State College, to be
sponsored by Debate Council. Har-
ry Wurtz and Joe Higgins, sopho-
mores, will meet harangers from
William Smith College in the ﬁrst
debate; Marion Sovik, ’44. and Shir-
ley Wurz, ’43, will debate in the
second. Also scheduled for March
is a debate with speakers from
the University of Dayton, Ohio,
on the topic: “Resolved: That the
federal government should regulate
labor unions.” State speakers for
this affair will be Rolf Toepfer, '43,
and Betty Cummings, ’42.

The freshmen debate squad com-
posed of Gordon Baskin, Sunna
Cooper, Louis Rabineau, and Sam
Scott will journey to Colgate this
weekend to participate in a series of
debates on the following subject—
"Resolved: That every male citizen
upon reaching the age of twenty—one
shall have received one year of mili-
tary training.” The team coached
by Glen Walrath, ’42, will leave Fri-
day afternoon by bus. The group
receiving the highest number of
points will receive a loving cup as an
award. The State frosh will engage
in eight debates—it is not known
which side will be taken, the affirm-
ative or the negative. In case of a
tie a “play-off” debate will be held.

PTEB Fills 296 Leads
In Three-Month Period

The Part Time Employment Bur-
eau has just released its report for
the period of September, 1941. to
January, 1942. During this time. 377
leads were received and of these,
296 were ﬁlled, a percentage of
78.2%.

76 of the 81 unﬁlled leads were
impossible to ﬁll with State College
students; that is, they were jobs re-
quiring over 30 hours per week,
room and board jobs, pin—boy jobs,
etc.

PTEB would like to remind any-
one who wants a lead to make an
appointment with Harold Feigen-
baum, ’43, or any other member of
the board. Appointments may be
made in the office of the Dean of
Women, at the PTEB desk.

Second semester cards should be
ﬁlled out as soon as possible by stu-
dents who have not already done so.

Debate Council is also making
plans for attendance at a state de-
bate conference to be held at Skid-
more College in April.

War Democracy
In Radio Speech

In a fifteen-minute speech to ra-
dio listeners of the Farm and Home
hour on Tuesday at 12:45 P.M., Dr.
Robert Rienow, Assistant Professor
of Social Studies, chose the topic en-
titled “Democracy Can Fight." The
text of the speech disproved the no-
tion among many United States citi-
zens that a democracy becomes a
dictatorship in war-time. Dr. Rienow
employed an imaginary “Mr. Croak-
er,” a typical citizen, who argued
that the United States is fast
becoming a dictatorship; that the
Bill of Rights and the Fifth Amend-
ment no longer protect the funda-
mental rights of the citizen. “Mr.
Croaker" illustrated several in-
stances such as restraint of press
and speech, the espionage law, the
regulation of factories, railroads
prices, and rationing in which the
central government had supreme
authority. Dr. Rienow admitted that
such a citizen. who complained about
the loss of “good old days." has a
good argument. He questions, how-
ever, whether the centralizing auth-
ority means dictatorship.

Warning the citizen not to “kick
the terms dictatorship and democ-
racy around,” he explained that a
legislature in the form of a “robot
cheering section,” appointed by a
central authority, is a dictatorship:
a legislature elected by and respon-
sible to the people is a democracy.
Dr. Rienow argued that to his
knowledge 1942 congressional elec—
tions have not been cancelled and
that Congress still listens to public
opinion is evidenced by the repeal of
the pension bill. He also cited a
typical example when on November
26, a plan was proposed for the
establishment of an artillery range
on Henry’s Lake which swans fre-
quented. Since other places could
be used for the range, pressure was
brought to bear on the President
himself by a small group thereby
causing the plans to be changed.

Corn Club, PGM-
Will Roller Skate

Pi Gamma Mu, honorary social
studies fraternity, and Commerce
Club are planning a combined roller
skating party at Mid-City Park,
Saturday, March 7. All members of
both the commerce and social studies
departments are invited.

Nicholas Morsillo, ’42, Chairman
of Arrangements for Commerce
Club. says that tickets will go on
sale next week for $.45. This price
i n c l u d e s transportation charges.
Busses will leave at 8 P. M.

This is the ﬁrst time that these
two organizations have organized
such a party. It is hoped that the
joint social function will attract
more members of both clubs than
when each society holds a separate
party.

June Haushalter, ’42, president of
P1 Gamma Mu, urges members of all
classes to come to the party at the
Menands rink. She says, “Keep ’em
rolling has taken on a new meaning.
Let's have an all-out turnout for a.
swell time.”

State College News

 

SEB Lists Result
Of Job Survey
Throughout US.

The following report is a compari-
son of the Student Employment
Bureau of New York State College
for Teachers with the report submit-
ted by the Eighth Animal Teacher
Placement Survey of the National
Institutional Teacher Placement
Association. The Association's sur-
vey involved 170 institutions engaged
in teacher education in 40 states. The
report gives State College students
their position in regard to the na-
tional supply and demand.
Math-Science Deﬁciency

One of the most emphatic over-
supplies was found in the Social
Studies and English departments.
The local bureau reports a similar
excess of students majoring in the
Social Studies. but not in English.

In addition. an undersupply of
teachers in science, mathematics.
commerce, and many specialty ﬁelds
was noted. Consistent with this, the
SEB has an undersupply in the same
ﬁelds, particularly Commerce. Al-
though no undersupply was men-
tioned in the survey, there is not a
large enrollment of students in the
library department here.

The only teaching combination
with which the SEB strictly agreed
was science - mathematics. Other
popular combinations include Eng-
lish-library, English-Social Studies
and French-Latin. Commerce calls
are seldom received 111 combination.

Although the survey does not give
any deﬁnite data on average salaries,
but rather approximate percentages
of increases, the following data on
average salaries has been compilch
by the SEB.

Wide Salary Range

The lowest salary for inexperi-
enced elementary teachers was $912,
while the highest was $1.350. The
lowest for secondary inexperienced
teachers was $1.000 and the highest
$1800.

In the experienced clcmenlnry
guild, the lowest snlnl‘y was $1,000
and the highest $1.600. The lowest
salary for cxpcricnccd secondary
teachers wus $1.200 and the highest
was $1,000. The average beginning
salary was $1,101.17 for beginning
tcnchcrs nnd for experienced men
and womcn ii wus $1,476.34.

Faculty Expects To Dine
At Expense of Myskania

Reputation is not the only
thing at stake in the coming
Myskania — Faculty basketball
game, for the two rivals have
placed a wager on the outcome
of the melee scheduled for
March 23.

Victory for the faculty means
that they will dine at the expense
of Myskania, but if the tables
are turned. the faculty will be
under the table. After having
carried out an extensive train-
ing program. the faculty are
very conﬁdent that they will be
victorious.

Myskania, too. has been prac-
tising very diligently and per-
severingly: they themselves urc
determined to outwit the Inc-
ulty.

Precautions For Health

Will Cause Removal
OF Vending Machines

Tentative plans to be effective
after the Easter vacation are being
made in regard to the reduction in
the price of milk from 70 a half pint
to tie through the elimination of
the vending machines, according to
Dr. John M. Sayles. President of the
College. Dr. Sayles stated that such
a change would be beneﬁcial to the
general health of the students, since
all consumer and health department
reports reveal statistics pointing to
the detrimental effect of concen-
trated beverages on the health of
the consumer.

Added Cost Raises Price

Raising of the milk price by 20
early in the ﬁrst semester was nec-
essitated by the increase in cost of
various foods in the Annex. Accord-
ing to former reports it was esti-
mated that the rise in the milk
price had cut down the sale of milk.
Students affected by the new price
turned to the vending machines to
buy soft beverages.

The students who consider milk
an integral part of their luncheon
menu were anxious to see the price
lowered to its former 5c. They felt
that compensation for the rise in the
cost of food should come from other
commodities than milk.

In order to reduce the price of
milk, the elimination of the vending
machines that sell substitutions is
necessitated. By taking this action,
the sale of milk will undoubtedly
increase. This action was taken not
only to safeguard the health of the
Milne students, but also the students
of State College. since the present
emergency taxes everyone’s re-
sources more than usual. Since milk
is regarded as an important element
in the diet of growing young people,
demands have been made that the
price of milk be reduced so that its
purchase may be increased.
Students Neglectful

Still another factor contributing
to the move to eliminate the vending
machines is that many students
have been negligent in disposing of
empty bottles. The bottles have been
carelessly thrown in any available
