. ‘-,Thesophomore women earned the
right. to take another crack at the
three points award for basketball
rivalry by their 25-23 win over the
freshman women on Wednesday
From the first whistle, the girls of
both teams kept the ball constantly
in motion. Passing was swift and
accurate; the forward combination
of Donann, LaSalle and Herdman for
the sophs and Giavelli, Garfall and
Smith for the frosh, clicked well to-
gether. The guards were constantly
breaking up plays; Dann was in al-
most every play and Tischler was
everywhere at once. At the half the
score was 12-11 for the class of ’45.
During the second half, the game
was slowed up by the many fouls
called on both teams. When the ball
was in play, the forwards tried many
long shots and a pass from one of
the guards would often travel the
length of the court. The score tee-
tered back and forth and at the end
of the third quarter it was tie at 15
all. The freshmen took the lead, but
by an effective use of the bounce
pass the sophs tied and won 25-23 on
a shot by Herdman in the last min-
nute.

Gillan Wins Trophy
For Intramural Bowling

The roll-offs for the individual
trophy of the intramural bowling
league were finally completed during
the past week. James Gillan was the
winner, clipping the pins for a neat
1089 total for the six games. Next
high was Bob Seifert. who knocked
over 1067 pins. Clarence Oarr, Fran
Mullin, Graham Duncan, and Joe
Tassoni followed in that order.

The trophy will be presented to
Gillan at the annual MAA banquet
in company with the team trophy,
which was won by Potter Club. It
is a silver plated ﬁgure in character-
istic bowling pose, mounted on a
black bakeiite base. The team trophy
is an oak plaque with gold plates, on
which the names of successive win-
ners may be engraved. It was just
purchased by intramural council this
year, this having been the first year
that a bowling league has functioned
successfully.

Potter Deleats CH

To Even Series

Although College House made the
first score through a set shot by Ken
Johnson, Potter Club’s showing of
perhaps the finest passing display in
this year’s Intramural Basketball
League swept the Central Avenue
lads off their feet to win 36-30 and
tie their rivals in the series for the
intramural basketball championship.

Nearly all of Potter‘s scores in the
ﬁrst half were lay-ups gained by
working the ball through College
House's heretofore impenetrable
zone. With little trouble Potter kept
ahead to lead by 12-6 in the first
period and 17—11 by half time.

The tide turned in the third quar-
ter, however, and for a while it
seemed as if College House’s pop-
shots were going to beat Potter. The
Central Avenue squad quickly tied
the score at 17 all, and then went
ahead with a two point lead. but the
tallies were even again at 24-24 by
the close of the third quarter .

"Red" Evans and Harley Ding-
man scored two quick ﬁeld goals to
give the State Street boys the lead,
but again CH tied the score.

It appeared that this score would
continue until the end of the game,
but at the 30-30 point Potter broke
loose and scored six points and then
froze the ball successfully for the
final score of 36-30.

"Red" Evans' 10 points were a big
factor in Potter’s win while Ruback
was high with 10 points for College
House.

Because of an injury to Howie
Lynch the third and deciding con-
test of this series has been postponed
until the early part of next Week,
instead of tomorrow.

With
CARL MITCHELL

We received the following com-
munication from one of the sports
fans at State:

Dear Carl,

I sincerely 'hope that we do not
"once again find ourselves writing
the obituary for one of State Col-
lege’s major sports—baseball."

It is unfortunate that circum-
stances have forced us to cancel the
baseball program for the coming
season; nevertheless, this does not
mean the death of baseball at State.
Let's consider it, instead, a relapse.

Sports have a unique position in
teachers’ colleges. A complete
sports program Is important to any
college, but it has an especial im-
portance in schools such as ours.
For by participation in the college
teams, the teacher-to-be gains
experience that will equip him for
coaching.

Basketball remains, but I dread
the thought of State becoming, much
less remaining, a “One-Dress Beu-
lah."

“Perhaps the grads will be pleased
—-I doubt it. for the resolution to
abolish baseball last year was re-
jected. according to S. A. Minuets,
with only one voice in favor, the
rcsolulioner’s.

“Watch the Dodgers this year”—
and maybe next year. too. But watch,
also. for baseball’s return to State
College."

Joe Sports Fan
Dear Joe Sports Fan,

Your point of view is well taken.
I agree that very few real sports
lovers would like to see any sport
abolished at their old Alma Mater.

But reality must be faced. There
is a shortage of manpower, not at
State alone. but in all other col-
leges as well. You know, it takes
two to make a battle. If one is
gone—no scrap.

I share your dread of State's be-
coming a one-sport-college—basket-
ball. But here I will go so far as to
predict, that unless freshmen are
used on the vm'sily cage team, even
basketball will go over the hill when
next season rolls around.

Just who is going to play on
these teams ? Any man in any col-
lege who Is fit to partake of the
sports program is also fit to per-
form some duty in his nation’s
military machine.

Another point. Just how many
men are going to be here next year
to go out for sports ? I can tell you
the number will be quite negligible.

We are at a crisis in our history.
It is no longer a case of going out to
fight some other country’s war. The
security of those we hold Inost dear
is seriously threatened in these
modern times.

Everyone and everything we have
now hangs in the balance. Do not
the blackouts alone bring this fact
to the surface ?

The male members of American
colleges are usually at an age when
their confidence is at a peak. A
challenge to a college man In any
situation rarely goes unaccepted.
That's what makes up the basis of
our sports programs. Other col-

leges dare us to come out and beat
the pants oil their teams. And the
dare Is taken up. The results of
course. vary, but the challenge is
always accepted.

Now a challenge has been offered
to these some men by much more
despicable competition. Watch the
results in Juncl

Rivalry Contest

The sophomore men added three
points to their rivalry score last Wed-
nesday night as they downed the
fresh, 38-33. This constitutes the
first basketball game won by the
men of '44 as a team. ’

The fresh scored first through
Hippick’s field goal and gained an
early lead. The yellow devils soon
hit their stride, however, and went
out in front with a lead which they
never relinquished. By the end of
the first period the sophs had a 14-
7 edge.

Led by Bob Combs and Bill Mars-
land, the sophs continued to out-
play their opponents as they length-
ened their lead to 21-12 at the half.

The game went on seeming to be
a walkaway for ’44. Early in the
last period, however, the freshmen
started hitting the hoops and to
narrow the gap against the soph
substitutes. But when the fresh
took the soph lead to 35-33, the first
team was immediately rushed in
and they soon quelled any victory
attempt by the yearlings.

But Hippick was high for the
evening with 12 points while Mars-
land paced the sophs with eleven
tallies.

Kennedy Will Speak
At MAA Banquet

Pat Kennedy, the most colorful
basketball referee in the country, will
be the major attraction of MAA’s
annual banquet next Friday night.
Bill Dickson, President of MAA be-
lieves that they “were lucky in being
able to obtain such a person as Ken-
nedy for our banquet.”

State sportsdom first came in con-
tact with this nationally famous
arbiter two years ago when he ref-
ereed the State-Pratt game in New
York City. This year Kennedy again
officiated at a varsity contest. this
time against Brooklyn Polytechnic.

His grandstand tactics on the court
make Kennedy a favorite with the
Metropolitan fans and he officiates
at collegiate contests frequently in
Madison Square Garden.

This year the banquet will be held
in the dining hall of Sayles Hall and
will begin at 6:30 P. M. Comment-
ing that the banquet will be on a
Friday. Owen Bombard, chairman of
the affair explained that March 20
was the only approximate date the
speaker was available.

All awards of the intramural bowl-
ing and basketball leagues will be
presented at the banquet. The price
for the banquet is set at seventy—
ilve cents.

Doings at State

After going all season without an
injury. Moose Gerber had to go and
drop a bottle on his foot (instead of
the floor) during a recent play. Now
a limp.

Fred Ferris. while skating at the
recent Com Club-Pi Gamma Mu
party had the misfortune to fail.
Four "pretty" girls immediately
picked him up. So Fred fell four
more times. He said, “Even though
I go to State, it was something new
to he picked up by girls."

Varsity Trounces Alumni
With Only One Casualty

In a snappy game featuring
plenty of scrap and ﬁght, the
State College Alumni were
handed the lower half of a 68-41
decision in the season-closer last
Saturday afternoon.

The Alumni, paced by George
Bancroft and Gerald Amyot.
with 10 and eight points re-
spectively, set a speedy start for
an early lead. However the
younger varsity members ganged
up on their elders and snatched
the lead after the first quarter.

Leading the State attack were
Hansen, Brauner, and Dickson
who split up thirty-ﬁve points
with 15, 10, and 10, in descending
order.

This marks the end of the
season for the 1942 edition of
the cage squad. Playing their
last game were Co-captains Bill
Dickson and Hank Brauner, Leo
Griffin, and Bob Seifert.

The only casualty of the an-
nual battle was a muscle ailment
for Gerry Amyot. The old boys
must be getting soft l

 

Less Skating Credit Needed

The unusually mild winter caused
the outdoor winter sports season of
WAA to be considerably curtailed.
Only one supervised hour is neces-
sary for skating credit, plus nine
other hours in this activity.

Bottleneck in Library
Will Receive Attention

The first day-time air raid prac-
tice to be held at State began
Tuesday at 10:27 A. M. with the
ringing of the four-bell alarm. Dr.
Minnie B. Scotland. post warden of
air raids in the college, asserted that
“both students and faculty showed
great sincerity and cooperation in
the practice. Quiet and order
reigned; and, although there was
not Inuch speed, all students were
back in their class-rooms in less
than 15 minutes."

“In spite of the general effec-
tiveness of the drill," said Dr. Scot-
land, “there are a few defects in
the procedure which will be rem-
edied immediately.” Students from
the library were hindered by the
necessity of having to hold the
heavy perister door for each other.
Hereafter. the ﬁrst two people out
of the library will open both doors
and hook them back. The library
group was further detained on the
stairs which were too narrow to
accommodate the number of stu-
dents. This difficulty will be re-
moved by having alternate persons
go through the ﬁrst ﬂoor of Draper
and down the center stairs.

On the ﬁrst ﬂoor of Draper, doors
in several of the class—rooms were
left open, providing a path to the

Plane Models and Blood

By Kay Doran

“Only Angels Have Wings" may
be an authentic statement. but
Milne students are now in the
process of revolutionizing the phrase
to include model airplanes.

The model aircraft project is a
nation-wide scheme instigated by
the Navy Department, which has
secured the cooperation of the
United States Office of Education
in the construction of model air-
planes us part of student vocational
training in public and private
schools.

These models will be used primar-
ily in civilian training for the all-
important purpose of spotting
enemy planes as well as in esti—
mating ranges and determining
cones of fire.

The Secretary 01" the Navy has
issued a call for 500,000 planes to
be constructed by students from
8,000 private and public schools
throughout the country.

There are approximately 50 differ-
ent types of planes utilized by the
United Nations and their enemies
all of which the Navy requires as
models. These include such air-
craft as bomber. scout, torpedo car-
rier and commercial plane.

Huyck Presents Play
For Assembly Program

Nominations of Student Associa-
tion officers for next year were
made in assembly this morning, and
Ralph Tibbeth President of Stu-
dent Association, appointed three
members to the election commission.
Included also in the program was
the presentation of an Advanced
Dramatics play about a Budapest
salesman who should not read
French illustrative magazines.

Student Association elections will
be held between the third Friday
in April and the ﬁrst Friday in
May, and the nominations took
place this morning in accordance
with a regulation which states that
nominations shall be at least two
weeks before elections. Howover,
nominations will be open for two
more weeks.

This morning's play, a comedy
translated from the Hungarian, was
directed by Dorothy Huyck, '43. The
story was about a Budapest sales-
man who saw in a French magazine
pictures of great men and wished
that he could change places with
them. But when he fell asleep and
dreamed that he had become
famous, the experience was not so
pleasant as he had anticipated.

Included in Miss Huyck’s cast
were Jane Curtis, Kathleen Martin,
Barbara Kerlin, George Kunz, and
Walter Grzywacz, juniors; James
McFeeley and Bub Adams. sopho-
mores; Arthur Collins, Daniel Re-
gan, and John Lubey, freshmen.

EDUCATION FOR VICTORY

Out of the 500 models. which is
Albany's allotment, Milne students
must construct 50 planes. one of each
type. Consultation with Mr. Ray—
mond, in charge of Industrial Arts,
indicated that Millie was already
“on the beam."

Mr. Raymond explained that the
miniature planes must be con-
structed from white pine, and
painted with black lacquer with the
absence of all identification marks
or names. The reason for this is
that color and identifications are
not visible in the distance.

They have under construction
many of the desired types with
wing spans from approximately 5
inches to 17 inches.

As a further incentive to students,
progressive certificates will be
awarded by the U. S. Navy Bureau
of Aeronautics to those students
who have been recommended by a
final inspection committee. These
awards will range from the title of
Cadet Aircraftsman to Captain Air-
craftsman.

Mr. Raymond urges those stu—
dents and faculty at State College
who are interested to arrange for
an opportune time for model con-
struction.

Meetings to Undergo
Reversal ol Procedure

Forum will hold an informal
meeting on Tuesday in the Lounge
at 3:30 P. M. The topic for dis-
cussion is: “What is the relation
between the United States and the
Soviet Union ?” All students are
urged to attend.

This topic was chosen because of
the necessity for Americans to
have a thorough understanding of
their new ally. Political, economic
and military phases of the rela-
tionship between the two countries
will be discussed, the most impor-
tant angles being the aiding of
Russia by Lend Lease, the com-
patibility of our governmental sys-
tems, and the securing of Vladivos-
tok by the United States as a naval
base for bombing Japan.

Forum has announced that a
reversal in the procedure of meet-
ings will occur. Previously, com-
mlttees were first appointed to
secure material, with a discussion
following the report. Now, to bring
about a greater student participa-
tion, round table discussion will be
held to discover what Forum mem-
bers should know, and afterwards
committees will be appointed to
secure the desired information.

Due to a recent wave of counter-
feiting prevalent in the Mohawk
Valley region, Forum is cooperating
with the Secret Service in its watch
for counterfeit money. Pamphlets
have been sent by the Secret Service
to instruct students in recognizing
the money. They are also sending
a moving picture entitled Know
Your Money to complete the phase
of Forum's educational program.

bombed in this war. If an emer-
gelicy occurred where a large
amount of blood was needed, this
source would be the ﬁrst to be
called upon since it is the only
hospital with a blood bank in this
district.

Any students who wish to donate
blood should call Dr. Frederick
Alexander at the Albany Hospital
for an appointment. As food fills
the blood with fat, he asks that the
contributions be made four hours
after eating.
