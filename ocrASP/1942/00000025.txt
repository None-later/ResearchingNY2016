 is Growing

', Praise is in order this week because State
College students are beginning to show their
worth. They are beginning to act like people
of college background in a national emer-
gency. An attitude is developing; slowly at
ﬁrst and now more rapidly we are beginning
to show signs of being “Educated for Vic-
tory.”

The ARP drill last Tuesday was lauded
by all. Students were calm and collected.
Especially notable was the complete lack of
“horsing around.” Lines of students ap-
peared as if by magic in the places that have
been deemed safest by defense officials. It
must be gratifying to those in charge to see
transformed into a successful reality hours
of physical and mental exertion spent in the
weeks of preparation. May the next drill
prove even more successful.

Afoot also and of student origin, are plans
for cheap and universal entertainment. One
of the greatest needs in a nation at war is
complete and satisfying entertainment. Such
affairs as the Red Cross—War Activities
Basketball Game and the Dorm Open-House
today, and the forthcoming Soiree and Mac-
Arthur Day do much to ﬁll a war-time quota
of inexpensive entertainment.

A spirit is growing among us. Slowly but
surely we are surging into a Victory philos-
ophy.

All the planes and tanks in the world do
not insure a United Nations victory, if the
men in those planes do not believe that they
are ﬁghting for something worthwhile. We
have started the spirit. Let’s keep it grow-
ing until it becomes an attitude that can’t
be licked.

Education in War and Peace

Ever since December 7, 1941, America has
been ﬂooded by “for victory” slogans. We’ve
had “Radio for Victory,” “Salvage for Vic-
tory,” “Blood for Victory,” and so forth. In
fact, nearly every campaign before the public
is a “for victory” drive. This we do not con-
demn, dare not condemn; for these very cam-
paigns are adding tremendously to the war
effort. But materialism alone cannot and
will not win the war. There must be ideal-
ism, a will to victory, and a hope of a better
world. To establish this attitude there must
be “Education for Victory.”

The signiﬁcance of this slogan breaks down
into two parts. First there must be education
“up to” victory. Here is included the train-
ing of sailors, soldiers, marines, air cadets,
coast guardsmen, officers, industrial work-
ers, engineers, doctors, nurses, etc., all of
whom are desperately needed to prosecute
the war. Everything must be sacriﬁced to
give them the best type of technical and
scientiﬁc training, that the American educa-
tional system can provide.

The second type of education is that which
must prepare the country and the world for
the victory when it does come. This means
that Americans must be educated to the fact
that there must be no recourse to isolation
again; that America must if necessary back
up its victory by force of arms to see to it
that the four freedoms and the Atlantic
Charter are “imposed” on the world.

Myskania, nervous lest confusion be created this
afternoon, has been assured by the faculty that its
“feeble five” will be ready for action at 3:.55 sharp.
. . . Any faculty player arriving after this will be
requiredjo have a signed statement from the referee
before he can enter the game. . . .

Mrs. Egelston’s History 22 class are all equipped
with identiﬁcation bracelets which may be
bought at the 5 8: 10 . . . for 25c. A good thing for
all students to have in case of emergency. . . .
Discourages souvenir hunters. too. . . .

Tony and Walt

In a postcard, Tony Wilk, '39. tells how he graduated
from pointing a pencil in Kerhonkson High to point-
ing one of the big guns toward the 'Frisco heavens.
No longer gazed at with awe and respect by the
embryonic scientists of Kerhonkson, Tony gazes at
the California sky—whence falls the gentle rain—in
search of the aircraft of the disrupters of democ-
racy. . . .

Tony was sent directly to his present address after
completing a 3 months course at the Coast Artillery
School at Fort Monroe. where he received a Corporal
degree.

Like all the boys in the camp. Tony would welcome
hearing from any of his old college chums. . . . Please
send mail. in care of San Francisco postmaster. to

Mitchell. returning from the annual News conven-
tion. tells of meeting Walt Harper popular president
of year before last‘s attitude builders. in the big city.

Walt is a lst class seamen. at present spending
about 10 hours a day in school~learning the trade. . . .
However. save your sympathy. as 41's romeo has his
evenings to spend as he chooses. . . .

The Napoleon of the Sports Department got only a
glimpse of Walt. and consequently did not bring back
much information about him. A more complete
account of \Valt‘s training, activities. etc., is expected
soon—but at present his address will have to suffice:
Walt Harper, 310 West let Street. Apartment No. 2,

Editor Trece and The Digest

Those war notices outside the Publications office,
giving an up-to-the-minute digest of important news.
are edited by Trece Arley. one of the prettier refuta-
tions of the old couplet “Boys never—ah—show
attention to girls who Wear glasses."

Most humorous notice of the week. in a traglc way,
was the Monday A. M. blt. quoted directly from the
radio, which understated as follows: "WaslI.—Milltary
experts say that the loss of 12 warships complicates
the methods of defending Australia.” Very profound.

Most welcome notice was the one telling of Mac-
Arthur’s new job. The hero of the Bataan is rapidly
replacing glamour boy Wendell as the Nation’s No. 2
Idol. . . .

Sauce tor Goose, Etc.

Last week's editorial concerning the Page Hall
incident would seem to infer that an old slogan has
been changed somewhat. It now goes, “\Vhat's sauce
for the goose is often applesauce for the gander."

Previous to the editorial there had been much
student comment over the use of the gym at night.
This is not one of the best methods of getting 100%
student cooperation behind the college war effort, no
matter who is right. Cooperation involves two parties
or groups playing square with each other. .

To the Editor:

Mr. Leneker has adequately linked
the war effort with State College
life in his weekly column. . . . V——.
In several paragraphs entitled.
“Who Is To Blame 5‘". Mr. Leneker
called attention to the Forum as
one of the organizations that. should
promote the war spirit. The Forum
Board recognizes that Forum Is a
splendid agency for student expres-
sion, as well as a medium for arous-
ing thought. Our entire program Is
constructed about a plan of discus-
sion. study and action of current
problems. It has been our Intention
this year to make the Forum a
college organization. All students.
regardless of their subject speciall-
zation. have deﬁnite responsibilities
as citizens and as future educators.

I admit that Forum has not. fully
taken the lead in leading student
activity and attracting large num-
bers; of students to its meetings.
However, to claim that Forum has
"degenerated" into an “old man."
who is badly in need of a share and
that it numbers among its members.
"buzzerds circling about in hopes of
a nice. luscious corpse." is a serious
charge. Forum activity cannot be
judged by attendance at meetings.
At present. there are at least 8
committees preparing reports for
the members; '7 timely and impor-
tant books are being reviewed; the
Soup-Bum has c~ollcge~widc circula-
tion; current magazines and book-
lets are in continuous circulation
among the faculty and members;
the Forum bulletin board is one of
the most informing centers in the
college.

May I remind you that it was
Forum that supplied the meentive
for the organization of the College

 

War Activities Council, that regis-
tered students for Defense work,
that helped to bring about an In-
crease In State's NYA appropriation,
that has taken effective action on
Important legislation, that has
sponsored round tables and discus-
sion meetings on many important
questions of the war. However, the
above Is a record of the past. The
ﬁrst assembly after Easter recess
will be a Town-meeting-of-the-Alr
sponsored by Forum for a frank and
open discussion of the war effort
at State. We are making plans for
cooperating with the Secret Service
In detectlng counterfeit money. Our
next meeting will be devoted to a
discussion of our relations with
Russla and the problems of war.
economic and political cooperation
with the Soviet Union.

We are heartily In agreement
with the News and Herb Leneker.
It Is our Intention to do all that. Is
possible to make the war more
intelligent and to clarify Its many
complex Issues. But. we cannot com-
pel interest or force student partici-
pation If there Is no genuine desire
or realization of our problems and
dangers.

Let's apply the formula so con-
cisely formulated by Herb Lcneker:
plan activities In a spirit of co-
operation, and make them Interest-
ing—make ever student feel that
he is needed. not only a few—and
when this has been done. then the
general student body can be blamed.

Forum Is for everyone. and If you
are skeptical, drop In at our meet-
ing on Tuesday and speak your
speech. Fred Ferris

Speaker of the Forum

Woe 4M4

by Feigenboum _._ _

The big news of the weal: is the
transfer of General MacArthur from
the Bataan Peninsula to Australia.
Arriving with his wile. child. and
general staff. he took over eornmand
of the American troops. in Australia
which have been arriving there since
Dec. 22 In “substantial numbers."
American and Australian fliers des-
troyed 23 enemy ships off the island
of New Guinea north of Australia
in an effort to delay the Jap inva-
sion plans of Australia until Mac~
Arthur can organize his I orces.

The removal of Mac-Arthur from
Bataan does n01 mean the end of
American and Filipino resistance
there. MacArthur is still in com-
mand of the army. but General
Wainwright has been put in charge
of ﬁeld operations.

The Navy Department revealed
last week that United Nations na-
val forces had suffered heavily dur-
Ing the invasion of Java. it was
announced that 1? allied warships
had been sunk at that time The
Navy Department and the Depart-
ment of Commerce Iomtij.‘ revealed
that a NO mile wide lane had been
established for our coaslvrlse ship-
ping. and that only one ship out of
600 using this lane had been sunk.

Hinman to Start Class
In Air Raid Precautions

Characteristics of Poison Gas

Will be Taught In Course

Miss Dorothy Hintnan, chub-man
of air raid courses for the city of
Albany. will start a new air raid
precautions class at the beginning
of April. The class, to be held every
Thursday night. will be open to
students exclusIVI-ly If enough are
Interested. Otherwise. citizens of
Albany will be admitted.

It Is an elementary course which
begins with general rules to be
followed ill the home to safeguard
against Illi‘ raids. Then, Miss Hin-
mun wlll teach the fundamentals of
poison gases, their characteristics,
effects and control.

Fifty-five students who took the
ﬁrst course will receive certiﬁcates
allowing them to take the advanced
classes In air raid duties, The
majority of the students who passed
the test made scores above 86%.
Certiﬁcates may be obtained from
Dr. Minute 8. Scotland In Room
263. Hosted. Monday after 12. or
Tuesday after 10 A. M.

Most of the recent sInkIngs on our
east coast have been outside of this
lane.

British and Chinese forces In Cen—
tral Burma are readying themselves
for the coming Jap drive into Man-
dalay and India. The Japs have
not as yet reached the main allied
defense lines.

Schicklgrubcr the Great made a.
speech last Sunday which was not-
able for its glaring absence of lies.
He blamed the recent German re-
verses on the coldest Russian winter
In 140 years. but he promlscd that
Russia will be crushed when he un-
leashes his summer offensive.

The Rcd Army Is determined to
prevent thls German offensive from
starting. Despite Russian wiutcr
successes all along the front. the
Germans have somehow succeeded
In holding various strong defense
points from which they hoped to
launch their summer offensive. Mos—
cow reports thnt they are closing a
trap on 200,000 Germans In the
Vyazma sector. 130 miles west of the

College of Mlnlng and Technology
to make Saturday, Aprll 11, General
Douglas MacArthur Day, In honor
of MacArthur’s heroic stand In the

estimated that 75 other schools
throughout the nation will adopt
this new vIctory drive. Thls move-
