silty, VI-M Awards
 I be Presented

‘1'} ,,: Matthew (Pat) Kennedy will be
"guest speaker at the annual MAA

Banquet to be held tonight at 8:30
in the dining room of Sayles Hall.
- Kennedy is at present the out-
standing referee in the country. A
recent issue of the Saturday Eve-
’ssina Post dedicated several pages
to the acrobatic stunts, whistle
blasts, and oversized .lungs of this
arbiter. "Kennedy." the article
states, “In full cry, is a phenomenon
of unrestrained sound and fury.’
It continues, “He is the most ex-
plosive, apoplectic and colorful r’ef-
eree who ever touted a whistle.

'1 No. 1 Referee

Not only is Kennedy noted for
his perpetual-motion action on the
court, but he is also a very capable
arbiter. He calls them close and
calls them right, and when he
does, everyone present hears and
sees that a foul is called. It is this
showmanshlp quality plus his cap-
ability that make Pat Kennedy
No. 1 referee in the land.

His popularity to both spectators
and players has made Kennedy a
fixture at the Madison Square Gar-
den. Moreover. he is the only ref-
eree who was ever publicized as
part of the double-feature billings
at the Garden.

In announcing that Dr. William
Hartley was to be toastmaster at
the banquet. Owen Bombard, ’43,
chairman of the affair, says that “in
Kennedy and Hartley we have two
people who certainly have excellent
knowledge of showmanship.”
Awards Will Be Made

Numerous awards will be made
at the banquet. Varsity basketball
men will receive letters and two-

'year men will be rewarded with gold
basketballs. Sweaters will be pre-
sented to co-captains Hank Brau-
ner and Bill Dickson by Coach Hat-
ﬁeld who will also announce next
year’s basketball captain. There will
also be an award for the best
athlete and for the person showing
the best sportsmanship in intra-
mural sports.

Presentation of a key to the pres!-
dent of Intramural Council, Regis
Hammond, will head the intramural
awards. This will be followed by
awarding the basketball trophy to
College House and a plaque to the
bowling champs, Potter Club. Jim
Gillan will receive a trophy for
high individual in bowling. and A1
Stiller will receive the ping-pong
trophy he won last fall. Fresh num-
erals and a key to the ’45 manager
will also be awarded.

Following the banquet all the
members of the Men’s Athletic Asso-
ciation are invited by the women of
Pierce Hall to an open house in the
logic room.

Basketball Victory Gives
’44 Three Rivalry Points

The Sophs gained three points in
rivalry by wresting a victory from
a fresh team in a roughly fought
contest Wednesday. The ﬁnal score
of 15-10 doesn’t begin to describe
the ﬁerce battle put up by both
teams.

The game started with swift
passes intercepted every other min-
ute by the guards. Valente, Tischler,
and Sanderson worked so efficiently
that the freshmen forwards had the
ball most of the ﬁrst half. Giavelli
and Smith accounted for a basket:
and the half ended with the fresh
leading by a point, 5-4. LaSalle made
the four sophomore points.

Close guarding in the second half
kept the score low, but frequent pile
ups provided thrills for the specta-
tors. Giavelli gained three more
points for the fresh and another
basket by LaSalle and a foul shot
by Pickert tied the score up at 8-8
at the close of the third quarter.

During the last quarter, the pass-
ing of the seph forwards speeded up;
Domann broke the tie with an
underhand toss. Giavelli came back
for the fresh with a shot from the
corner. In the next few minutes,
Pickert’s foul shots and Breunig’s
basket gave the sophs a ﬁve point
lead. Simmons, Dann and Latimer
smothered the ball until the ﬁnal
whistle and victory.

Brauner to Organize

State Racquet-wielders

With the drying up of the mud
following Easter vacation, the twang
of the racquets of the State College
tennis team will once more resound
on the Ridgeﬁeld courts.

Captain Henry Brauner plans to
start practicing in the gym imme-
diately following Easter vacation.
As yet only three positions on the
team have deﬁnitely been taken, by
Hank Brauner, Newt Kensky and
Fran Mullin. Three positions re-
main wide open fer those aspiring
“racqueteering” fame.

A ten-game schedule has been set
up for the tennis team. The sextet
will play two matches with RPI,
Siena, Cortland Normal, and Platts-
burg Normal. One match will be
played with Brooklyn Poly and
Clarkson. Of these. ﬁve will be
home games.

Due to the shortening of the
school term, the tennis season will
open either April 23 with a home
game or April 24 at RPI. This
leaves a relatively short time for
the squad to get in Shape. There-
fore those interested must sign up
on the MAA bulletin board on Mon-
day, Tuesday. and Wednesday of
next week.

With
cam. MITCHELL

Sports may be dying in the Ameri-
can college set-up but here at State
there seems to be a general revival
of athletics as a big weekend is
ﬂashed on the blackout shades.

This afternoon we have a beneﬁt
game for the American Red Cross
between the Myskania Mystery Men
and the State Faculty (mystery—
hidden muscles). Another unique
contest will take place when the
campus teachers will be given a
chance to take it outrun their Milne
proteges on the High School varsity

. . need it be said there’s bound to
be blood . . . and not transfusions!

Also in the athletic roundup is
the annual MAA Banquet that
will take place tonight. Color-
ful Pat Kennedy has been sched-
uled to speak. We take our toupcs
off to Bill Dickson, Owen Bombard.
and the other members of MAA
Council who are responsible for
getting such a top-ranking speak-
er for the event.

Despite the unprecedented selec-
tion of “fish-day" we heartily ex-
pound the cause and urge all sports-
men to be there when the starting
gun is ﬁred . . . “commence eating"!

The saddest news of the day is
the flash that powerful LIU suf-
fered defeat at the hands of the
University of West Virginia, after
leading 25-16 at half time. We
still think Claire Bee is great.
Another upset that occurred in
the National Invitation Tourna-
ment at the Garden in New York
was the defeat of West Texas
State Teachers (the tallest team
in the country) by Creighton
University, 59-58. Pat Kennedy
officiated, incidentally.

Tidbits in Sports

The women are certainly taking
the spotlight in rivalry. The basket-
ball games are attracting large audi-
ences—and they actually cheer for
their teams!

Recruiting is not done by the
armed forces alone . Virginia
Mosschak has found it necessary to
draft a certain male on Tuesday
afternoons to engage in badminton
in order to get gym credit . . . lucky
guy, we say.

Now that students are marked
absent if they are tardy to class,

there seems to be a good chance for
cross-country returning to State.

Herb Lenneker, prefatory general-
izing columnist, continues to make
cracks at the sports department. He
is very confident. for . . . and we
quote . . . "you can’t find anything
wrong with me.”—unquotei

College House Champs;
Beet Potter Club 31-19

College House came back strong
to win the third and deciding game
of their play-oﬁ' with Potter Club
for the intramural basketball cham-
pionship by a 31 to 19 score.

It was all College House in the
first quarter as they took a com-
manding 10-0 lead. Potter Club
could not shake a man loose against
the opposition’s zone defense.

The height of Ruback and Wise
gave College House possession of the
ball on nearly every jump-ball or re-
bound from the basket. Ruback’s
14 points was high for the game.

Where are all the girls of State
College going tomorrow night?
That’s right, to the WAA Spring
Sports Spree. At eight o'clock the
gym will be set for an evening of
fun and entertainment.

For the first hour, the girls can
amuse themselves with games and
contests. Basketball, volley ball,
badminton, and ping-pong will be
set up to insure everyone some-
thing to do. The general chairman,
Leda LaSalle, promises that the bas-
ketball and volley ball will be plenty
strenuous for those who want to
play hard, and that ping-pong and
badminton will be exciting, but less
wearing.

Fencing and Dancing

The fencing class will exhibit
their skill in a demonstration of
the results of their Saturday morn-
ing lessons. The modern dance
group has guaranteed a program of
the latest modern dances which will
be amusing as well as instructive.
They intend to show us rhythmic
coordination if they're not too stiff
from practicing.

The bowling cup will be awarded
to the team having the highest
number of points in the six game
tournament. Psi Gum and Gamma
Kap still have one game each to
play, but unless they are tied, the
winner will be announced Saturday
night.

Remember the skit of a Camp
Johnston week-end at the WAA tea?
At the Spring Sports Spree there
will be another skit, just as much
fun as the last one.

Refreshments Too

Folk dancing will highlight the
evening with the usual hilarity and
exhaustion. But the girls will not
go home tired and hungry, because
refreshments are also on the pro-
gram.

Kit Herdman and Win Jones have
charge of arrangements, Vee Leigh
and Teddy Jay, entertainment, and
Lois Dann refreshments. All these
people guarantee a super evening.

ALBANY, NEW YORK, FRIDAY, APRIL 10,194!

Delaney Asks
HousingEstimate
For Next Year

Miss Sara T. DeLaney, Dean of
Women, has requested that those
students who plan to reside in a
cooperative house next year return
their applications to her office not

later than April 11. Students who,‘

upon signing an application, ﬁnd it
necessary to withdraw from the col-
lege must inform the Dean of their
intention not later than August 15
if they wish their deposit to be re-
funded.

No deﬁnite price for cost of group-
house living has been formulated at
the present time due to the effect
of the war on student enrollment
and living expenses. The Dean
asserted, however, that the costs
will be kept as low as possible so
that group-house living will be
approximately $100 cheaper than
residence at the dorm.

Students, therefore, will not be
asked to sign contracts with a group
house until more deﬁnite informa-
tion may be obtained telenable the
students to state their choice.

Last fall the house which Juni-
pers occupied was sold. but since
Junipers had signed a lease, evacua—
tion was postponed until next fall.
The Dean announced that Junipers
will rent another house sometime
during August. Here again, this
cannot be accomplished until the
number of prospective residences
can be determined from applica-
tions of upperclassmen and from
the incoming class to determine the
size for adequate accommodation.

There will be no change, however,
in the type of work or the average
number of hours required of those
living in group houses. The Dean
requested that those who are plan-
ning to ﬁle an application for the
first time be acquainted with these
facts. The students will be asked
to contribute an average of one hour
of work per day, though the dis-
tribution of working hours differs.

Those who wish information con—
cerning cooperative houses are urged
to consult the Dean and, if possible,
visit each residence hall to gain an
insight on group-living in the col-
lege.

Cooper Completes Work
For Philosophy Degree

Dr. Edward Cooper, Instructor in
Commerce, has recently completed
the requirements for his Doctor of
Philosophy degree at Northwestern
University. Dr. Cooper received
his Bachelor of Science degree in
Education at the Whitewater State
Teacher's College, and his Master
of Arts degree at the University of
Iowa. Dr. Cooper will receive his
doctorate at the Northwestern Uri-
versity graduation this June.

It Will Only Lead to Bloodshed

It We Deed It -— Or II We Don’t

"It's an all-out charity dance for
victory—so let's show our hearts are
really in it by wearing defense
stumps instead of corsnges.” That's
the cry of the pro-stamp-corsagers.
Corsages are a luxury. unnecessary
to the welfare of dancers—in fact
they even “get in the way" seine-
times. Stamps would be much more
Wearable! And as for the cheupness
of flowers—well. a penny saved is
a penny for the government's de-
fense program. and pennies make
dollars and dollars make war.

Beauty lost? No, a girl shouldn't
need flowers to help her out. (And
if she's beyond help, not even liow-
ers will do any good). Furthermore
why stay in the rut our grand
mothers Were in? Start something
new and different—and useful!

Another thing  you can find
green defense stamps. So, plant
the ﬂowers in your garden and pick
’em for the county fair—but don't
wear 'em to State's fermais.

Maybe they’re not patriotic or
maybe it's just that they're more
practical. But. anyway, as the anti—
stamp-corsagcrs have it, "if you
really want to help the nation save.
why not save on something big and
worthwhile? Why spend from one
to three hundred dollars on an
orchestra and then. save a few
dollars on flowers. The real McCoy
in patriotism would be the abolition
of an orchestra."

Of course, there’s also the pain!
of beauty to be censidered»~nwn like
their dates to blossom forth at
formula in a way that only flowers
can provide. And the dresses which
need that extra touch—what about
them? If it's not a corsuge, it’s got
to be jewelry. Either way costs
money.

“So. let's not go funatically silly
over the stamp-corsugc idea.” the
opponents warn. "Anyhow, you can't
stop nature's production (of flow-
era) just for the war and the army
doesn't need 'cm, yet."

pen Seph Soiree at 10 P. M. tonight

Forum Presents
War Discussion

’Town Meeting’ Answers
Complaints and Queries

“State College Looks at the War"
was the subject of the discussion
held in assembly today. Sponsored
by the Forum and modeled on the
Town Meeting of the Air, it was led
by Fred Ferris. '42, chairman, with
the help of Nicholas Morsille, '42,
announcer.

The ﬁrst part of the program
consisted of four short speeches. two
by faculty members and two by
students. Dr. Robert Rienow, As-
sistant Professor of Social Studies,
gave the political aspects of the
war and the war aims; Dr. Louis
C. Jones. Instructor in English,
spoke of the actual conduct of the
war; Herbert Leneker, ’43. showed
what we, at State College, are do-
ing to help toward victory; and
Rhona Ryan, ’44, gave ideas about
what could be done.

These talks were followed by
questions among the speakers them-
selves and questions presented to
the speakers by members of the
student body.

The Forum felt that there have
been many complaints and mum-
blings among State College students
who have either felt that they were
wrongly accused of complacency or
i'elt that State College was not en-
tirely behind the war efforts. “The
idea of this meeting,” said Fred
Ferris, president of the Forum, “was
to clean the linen and ﬁnd out the
facts." He added that the Forum
has held discussions similar to this
all year on Tuesday afternoons and
would hold more in the future.

Hartley to Show Films
At Chem Club Social

Dr. William Hartley, Assistant
Professor of Education, will reel off
three General Electric sound films
in color. at the Chemistry Club
social next Thursday evening at
7:30 in Room 250, Huested Hall.
Jnnct Dixon, '42. Vice-president of
the club, is general chairman for
the event.

One 01' the films which Dr. Hart-
Icy will present treats the discov-
cry of and recent developments
will! the electronic microscope;
another is entitled “CurVes of
Light". and is about the refraction
of color and light. The third ﬁlm,
"Science vs. Magic", explains the
(iiii'crenpe between the scientist's
and the mugician's approach to
problems. Science attempts to make
baffling things simple. but magic
attempts to make simple things
baffling.

Robert Wesschnun. '43. will dem-
onslrutc developments in the ﬁeld
of tone photography; two comical
skits are the offering of sopho-
mores Adele Lewis and Alan Stone.
The evening will wind up with games
and refreshments under the direc~
tion of Frances Gracefi'o, ’42.

According to General Chairman.
Richmond Young. Soiree-goers have
a southern cruise in store for them
from 10 P. M. to 2 A. M. amidst
the nautical atmosphere of the
Aurania Club. Through the courtesy
of the Albany Yacht Club, life pre-
servers and 300-lb. anchors will lend
an authentic note to the atmos-
phere. Besides this, the meager war
budget allotted for decorations-will
carry the idea of S. S. Soiree still
further. Hannelore Schoen says,
“The Sophs really have shown loads
of ingenuity for doing so much with
so little money."

Sweethearts to be Chosen

Shortly after midnight, Red Car-
ine and drummer will choose the
Sweethearts of Soiree from among
all the couples present. The Sweet-
hearts are to receive awards as in-
dications of their attractiveness and
dancing ability. This is only the
second year that this idea has been
used. Previously the chaperones se-
lected “The Typical Twosome."

William Marsland of the music
committee predicts huge success for
Carino's 9-piece band. The orches-
tra was extremely popular at both
Russell Sage and Union.

To ﬁt in with the war sacriﬁce
spirit of the dance. the campaign
for war stamp corsages started be-
fore Junior Prom is being continued.
Trece Aney and Rhona Ryan, in-
augurators of the idea, urge all
girls to wear corsages composed
either completely or partially of
war stamps.

Fun, War Saving Combined

“Despite the fact that this is
State’s ﬁrst war-time Soiree, it is
setting a precedent for other dances
combining both fun and war sav-
ing." says Young.

The sale of bids which started
Wednesday will continue until 4
P. M. today in the lower hall of
Draper. Bids may also be purchased
at the Aurania Club.

Chaperones for the dance are: Dr.
J. Allan Hicks, Professor of Edu-
cation, and Dr. Donnai V. Smith,
Professor of Social Studies.

Heading Soiree committees are:
Arrangements, Mary Studebaker;
Programs, Carmelina Losurdo; Pub-
licity, Hannelore Sheen; Decora-
tions, Doris Lichwart; Chaperones.
Mildred erosloff; Music, William
Marsland and Patricia Latimer.
