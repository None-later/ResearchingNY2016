Mumaw to Give Fraternities Plan

Dancing Recital

Formerly Chief Soloist
With Shawn Company

Barton Mumaw, for seven years
the principal soloist for Ted Shawn
and his company, who toured the
United States, England, Canada,
and Cuba, and who is new con-
sidered one of the best dancers in
America, will be presented by the
Dramatics and Art Association in
Page Hall Auditorium, Wednesday
evening, April 15, at 8:30 P. M.

Most of the dances that Barton
Mumaw will perform at his recital
show his intense happiness in danc—
ing and a thorough relish of pre-
cision and emphasis in rhythm and
of the dramatic emotion of the
moment. One by way of contrast
has stark tragedy for its theme, that
most immediate tragedy of the de-
struction of beautiful cities with
which the whole world is now pre-
occupied. This dance is Mumaw's
Pierrot in the Dead City.

Story of Pierrot

For hundreds of years Europe
has been building beautiful cities.
For as many years a legend has
grown up in them of a mythical
character called Pierrot, who is
the spirit of romantic life and love,
the central character of many a
ballet and pantomime. Mumaw
portrays Pierrot returning to the
city in search of a lost sweetheart,
but finds the city dead, destroyed,
empty of life.

The program has a wide range of
material based on the dance arts
of ancient and primitive peoples.
These dances partly reflect the in-
fluence of Ted Shawn who collected
such materials among the Indians
In America. among the gypsies in
Spain, and in the islands of the
Pacific.

‘Auihentlc Costumes

Many of the details in Mumaw's
costumes are of authentic origin. In
The Mongolian Archer he wears a
pair of Chinese shoes, thickly soled
and as cumbersome as peasant
wooden shoes. Another costume
detail of particular interest is the
nine-yard banner used by the dancer
in his Banner Bearer (pictured
above) which is based on the tra-
ditional ceremony opening the
Olympic Games.

Student tickets may be obtained
in exchange for student tax tickets.
Reserve seats are $1.10.

Panel Discussion Slated

The informal discussion procedure
initiated at the last Forum meeting
will be continued at a meeting Tucs~
day at 3:30 P. M. in the Lounge.

feit money. A campaign making use

be started soon.

Siovin Proplmm Victory
With Trouser Coifs’ Exri

They weren’t bombed, they
weren't rationed, and they didn't
shrink—Slavin's pants. Nope,
they just came in for their share
of Slavln's private campaign for
victory.

You see, one day Dave was
sitting on a pile of newspapers,
stacked in the midst of the
tooth-paste tubes in his room.
Suddenly, over the air waves,
came a booming voice, “You
can help win the war—especial-
ly if you're five feet one and
a half (in stocking feet) with
red hair and a big vocabulary
-—-decuff those pantsii"

Slavin pulled off his gas-
mask and scratched his head.
He remembered Valley Forge,
the Maine, the Alamo, and even
Pearl Harbor. “Mon Dieu,"
parley-vooed Dave, “I will do
it!" Whereupon the patriotic
’43er took out his wooded scis-
sors (the steel ones had to go
in the last salvage) and snipped
off his trouser cuffs amid a
cloud of dust. So, whenever you
see two blue pillars approach-
ing, don’t think you’re in Dover
—it's only Dave who hasn't yet
got around to substituting de-
fense stamps for his cuffs.

 

  
    

Who Will Be Next?-—_

by the Sophomore Desk Editors M m

(Editors’ Note: The following is an expression of opinion a a

not necessarily reﬂect the views of the STAT Cosmos Nsws. The informa-
tion therein was correct at the time of printing).

When State College voters visit
the Commons balcony on Tuesday,
April 14, they must remember that
just as it is important that the
nation have an efficient war-time
administration, so is it necessary for
the welfare of the college to select
capable leaders.

A singular maneuver was made
on Wednesday when Thomas Fee-
ney, a formidable contender for
President of Student Association,
withdrew his name from the list of
candidates. He now plans to run
for President of the class as a “third
term" candidate. Howard Lynch is
a newcomer to loom on the political
horizon. Not a politician, he, how-
ever, is well-known as a reliable
committee worker. His popularity
has aided him in attaining the pres-
idency of Potter Club for next year.
Still, if Potter fails to withdraw Re-
gis Hammond, the Club’s vote may
be split, and Lynch will undoubtedly
be defeated. All this seems to in-
dicate the swing to Vanas on the
political pendulum. Aside from the
support of the loyal SLS fraternity

DO YOU DIG IT?

he is also backed by a powerful
College House combination.

There seem to be many conﬂicting
opinions concerning the Vice-Pres-
idency, which may ultimately result
in a political upset. Pat Latimer,
the only woman candidate, is bene-
ﬁted by political experience. Vice-
President of the class in her fresh-
man year, she then gained the key
position of secretary of student As-
sociation. Her most powerful op-
ponent was found in Bob Combs.
who withdrew in favor of a try for
class president. The possibilities of
Fred Beyer and Hal Ashworth are
deemed equal; both are backed by
their fraternities, and will be aided
by their likeable personalities and
large feminine following.

As for the Secretaryship, Fran
Mullin will doubtlessly afford strong
competition, since he is backed by
the powerful Potter Club, and aided
by the expected division in women’s
votes. Martha Sprenger was a cap-
able and popular songleader and
may offset the excess feminine can-
didates.

Faculty Bows to Amazing Saphomore Agregaﬂ

By Jeanette Shay

“If you don't pat yourself on the
back, nobody else will." This say-
ing may apply to some people, but
its author never met the Sophomore
class of State College. The mem-
bers of the class of '44 don't have
to pat themselves on the back, for
their admiring teachers realize how
modest they are and do it for them.

Dr. Hartley, when approached by
a News reporter and asked to ex-
press his opinion of said class,
opened his class book and upon
perusing its revealing pages, re-
marked, “My principal objection to
the Sophomores is that they are
such a unique group that I find it
difficult to find anyone to give C's
to. I have to give all A’s and B's.
However, I have found them ex-
tremely generous, especially the
boys who gave me a red bow tie
for Christmas. As far as the girls
are concerned, their pulchritude is
only excelled by their keen intellect,
wit, and charm of personality."

Although the commerce teachers
holding sway on third floor Draper,
have encountered only a small pro-
portion of the class, they have very
positive impressions of the group
they have met. “The Sophomores
seem to be very peppy," said Miss
Avery. “From my very limited con-
tact with them," stated Mr. Cooper,
“I am of course impressed by their
general appearance and the diligent
effort displayed in their class work."

STATE COLLEGE NEVIS, FRIDAY, APRIL 10, 194!

Even Mr. Gemmeii, the latest ad-
dition to the commerce faculty, ap-
preciates the superiority of the
Sophomore class. He said, “My
three months at State College have

not all been spent in orientation. In.

fact, I have been conducting a bit
of research ‘as it 'twere,’ comparing
the intelligence and ingenuity of
college Sophomores with that of
high-school Sophomores, and, con-
trary to educational fact and popu-
lar belief, the college Sophs are just
a mite quicker on the downbeat!"

A lot is heard about the lack of
men at State but according to Miss
Futterer the class of '44 does not
suffer from such a deficiency. En-
thusiastic in her praise of the soph-
omores, she declared, “I think it’s
a swanky class. I could have made
two Advanced Dramatics classes
this year. I’ve actually had to strug-
gle over my choice. What's more
I'm going to have some men.” Miss
Hopkins labeled the Sophomores as
dependable and resourceful. She
even went so far as to say, “The
Sophomores are the best workers in
my stagecraft group."

Dr. Croasdale, who does not see
many Sophomores this year says
she remembers them from last year
as “the most dynamic, stimulating,
and up-and-coming crowd—a chal-
lenge to any teacher!”

Maybe it's a compliment, maybe
not, but Dr. Rienow says he can't
distinguish between the Sophomores,
Juniors, and Seniors. At least it

shows that the ‘  "

Rienow said, "Any class wt
more years ahead in

for its courage, foresight, remit .
and willingness to work for a goal
(and shift while they approach it) .”

Although Dr. D. v. Smith says
that he “always liked Sophomores
anyway," he agreed that this Sopho-
more claas is a little better than
:sual, “especially in the talking
no.”

To avoid the possibility of some "

freshman's thinking the above arti-
cle is colored by prejudice on the

part of the writer, a few of Dr.

Jones' quotations are included. He
describes the Sophomores so “a
charmingly daft gang of brilliant
madman" and “lovable idiots."
“The beauty of the men" said he,
“is only surpassed by the brilliance
of the women."

Mademoiselle Conducts Poll

In a nation-wide poll conducted
by Mademoiselle, 25 women from
this college were selected at random
to state their preference in campus
styles. Some of the questions asked
concerned the type and color of
sweaters preferred, the style and
color of shoes customarily worn,
and an estimate of the price paid
for both articles. Results of the poll
will be published in the college is-
sue of the magazine in August.
