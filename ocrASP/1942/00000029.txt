With the opening of the intra-

to school last fall the Sophs im-
mediately shotved up as the bulwark .

spectacular runs were sure groun'd
gainers for REP, while Bob Combs
passing and Rich Young's receiving
ware constant scoring threats. .

‘ The Ramblers were held together
by our Bert Kiley, who both played
and coached. Now and then Bill
Marsland snared a pass from Ray
Verrey’ to score for KDR. A team
composed of this unique combina-

. tion walloped the fresh gridders
13-12.

Forty-four's power was also
shown as they bowled over the fresh-
men in push ball 18-10.

At about the same time the Soph
girls under the leadership of Mary
Domann and Kit Herdman gar-
nered two out of three points in
the girls' obstacle races to lengthen
the Soph rivalry lead to 7-1.

Sophs In Basketball

Varsity basketball was also de-
pendant on, several Sophomores.
Bill Marsland was invariably in there
under the basket, taking rebounds
time and again. Set shots were
“Robin” Comb's specialty as he
netted many points for the Alma
Mater. Two of the most spirited
boys on the whole squad were Rich
Young and Bill Miller, inspirations
to any team,

The varsity’s loss was College
House's gain in the person of Hank
Ruback, ’44. Hank was definitely
the most vulnerable scorer of the
intramural league, as he took indi-
vidual high scoring honors easily.
He was aided by Clarence Carr and
Henry Wise. both Sophomores, in
leading College House to the top
of the league.

Red Evans. Charlie Capel, Hal
Ashworth, Avrom Koblenz, Bert
Kiley. Fred Beyer. and Paul O’Leary
were all Sophomore “ﬁnds” for
their respective intramural basket-
ball teams. The squad composed of
these men walked over the fresh-
men hopefuls 38-33.

Females Shine Also

posed of Kit Herdman, Mary Do-
mann, Leda LaSalle, Marge Breunlg.

Latimer, Dot Simmons. Lois Dann,

contests to add three more rivalry
points.

And if you think the women of
’44 are sissies. you should see Pat
Carroll and Teddy Jay fence!

The only two '44ers out for tennis.
Bill Marsland and Bernard Bern-
hardt, are bound to be a great help
to State's prime spring sport.

The opening of the softball sea-
son will see the usual athletic Sophs
standing out for their group teams.
Their ability to defeat the fresh-
man softbaliers can only be told
by time.

Men's Ping Pong Tournament

The men's annual ping-pong
tournament is well under way, two
matches having been completed at
present. The difficulty in finding a
time when all four men may be able
to play is the main reason why more
matches have not been played.

Newman Drops One,

Draws Second Place

The girls’ basketball league ended
Wednesday afternoon with Dorm
A on top by virtue of defeating
Western Hall, 14-4. Due to the
shooting of Herdman. Henessy. La-
Salle and Domann and the very
effective guarding of Latimer and
Sanderson. this team ends the sea-
son with the honor of being unde-
feated. Pickert took care of the
scoring for Western.

The second game was decidedly
one-sided. Newman Hall defeating
Dorm C by the topheavy score of
17-0. Garfall and Giavelli ended
the season in top form. Giavelli
rang up 9 of Newman’s points and
Garfall ran a close second with 8.
The bottom rungs will have to do
without Newman Hall for this year
as they ended in second place with
only one loss against them.

Junipers forfeited to Dorm C leav-
ing them tied for third place with
Dorm B.

AnotherGood Man Gone

Van dooed it. The lad who led
the freshmen into some of the
bloody rivalry battles last year,
Van Vliet Schultze, went and got
hitched!

Miss Harriet Valentine of Os-
cawana is the lucky girl, and we
wish the both of them the best
of luck in the years to come.

We Sophomores remember
Van as an up and coming ath-
lete last year and as a fellow
who was always ready for rival-
ry—organized or unorganized.

l-M Softball League
To Start Next Monday

For these “wizards of ooze” who
have been rushing the baseball sea-
son despite the rain and mud, the
awaited word has come—the intra-
mural softball schedule will begin
Monday if the weather permits.
Intramural Council has. received
permission from President Sayles to
use the college campus. With this
and the ﬁeld between the dorms as
diamonds, they have made plans to
stage two contests on every day
possible. each starting at 4:30.

The league will be composed of
the same eight teams that recently
completed the basketball schedule:
College House, Kappa Beta, Kappa
Delta Rho. Potter Club. Sayles Hall,
Sigma Lambda Sigma, Thomas
More House and the Ramblers.

Potter Club, last year's champs,
have virtually the same team.
Kappa Beta, 1941 runner-up. posses
the same vaunted power they dis-
played in football and basketball.
The other six teams appear both
strong and confident.

1942-43 Basketball Schedule
The completed basketball sched-

ule for next season. recently released

by Coach Hatﬁeld, is as follows:
December 4—Clarkson.

With the ﬁrst match of . State
College’s 1042 tennis campaign less
than three weeks away, Captain
Hank Brauner sent 23 candidates
for the squad through Indoor prac-
tice sessions on Tuesday and Thurs-
day in preparation for cutting the
group to workable size. Brauner
and Harry Kensky, the only veter-
ans returning. and newcomer Fran
Mullin, who showed class in the
fresh tournament last fall, form the
nucleus around which Hank plans to
build the team that will go after
State’s first undefeated season in
history.

Of the 20 men ﬁghting for the.
remaining four berths on the seven-
man team, the top-ranking six after
about a week of stiff workouts will
be placed in ladder competition
along with Brauner, Kensky, and
Mullin for selecting the occupants
of the remaining open places.

Saturday will see the hopefuls
holding their ﬁrst outdoor session
of the year at Ridgeﬁeld Park. The
ﬁrst cut will be made Friday morn-
ing. Ridgefield will be the home
courts of the Statemen.

The ten-game schedule, which
opens here against Plattsburg on
April 23, includes a long-sought
home game with RPI. The latter
comes up with almost the some
powerful squad which shackled the

in Captain Brauner’s opinion, the
Poly team, of the known quantities,
constitutes the major threat to an
unbeaten year.

Slena and Cortland, though no
soft touches, should, Hank thinks,
be made to fall in line. No informa-
tion has been obtained concerning
the material at Plattsburg, Clark-
son, or Brooklyn Polytechnic Insti-
tute. all State tennis rivals this year
for the ﬁrst time.

New with the tennis team is the
problem of transportation for away'
games. Captain Brauner indicated
that he intends to ask further aid
of MAA to meet the situation. In
previous years the netmen travelled
with the baseball squad to play
games on enemy courts. Baseball
has been dropped for the season.

Representatives of Organizations
Resolve to Maintain $14 Tax Ticket

Next year’s student tax will remain at $14, as provided in a tentative

budget, formulated last Tuesday at a
diﬂ’erent extra-curricular organizations.

meeting of the representatives from
The purpose of this meeting was

to cut the appropriations to an absolute minimum and to set the price of
the student tax as low as possible. despite the rise in costs of many items

included in the budget.

 

Students to Pay One Dollar
For This Year’s Pedagogue

Dear students . . . do you want a
lingering memory of your carefree
college days? If so, save your dimes;
save your nickels for the 1942 Peda-
gogue will make its appearance on
Moving-up Day, May 9. Instead of
the usual $.50 charge of previous
years, this year's publication will
cast student tax holders $1.00. This
increase is the result of the in-
creased production costs and dc-
crcascd student enrollment at State.

Shirley Kyle, ’42, editor-lu-chief
of the Pedagogue, declined to reveal
the theme of the book, saying, “It is
traditional that the theme of the
Pedagogue not be revealed until
Moving-up Day."

Juniors trying out for next year’s
PM]. board have to plan several
pages of a model yearbook.

Another meeting is planned for
Tuesday, 4:30. in Room 109, at which
time those interested in the budget
should attend either to express opin-
ions or ask questions. Next Friday
has been set as the date when the
budget will be presented in Assem-
bly, and an additional Friday will
be used, if needed. in order to have
the budget for 1942-43 adopted by
the Student Association.

The allotted appropriations shown
above are only temporary estimates.
Final estimates have not as yet been
made. Representatives from such
activities as Music Council, Women's
Athletic Association. Men's Athletic
Association, Debate Council, and the
Part Time Employment Bureau
were not present at the Tuesday
meeting and. therefore, estimates
could be made only from their last
year's appropriation. The News on
the other hand. has not as yet
signed its printing contract, and
the appropriation which the News
needs will depend on this contract.

Some of the appropriations could
not be cut at all; such as Inﬁrm-
ary. which gets $3 from each student
tax sold. Freshman Handbook. the
'l‘rcusurcr's Bond, and Secretarial
Contingency fund (a reserve fund).
The Pedagogue. however. had its
r'rppropriation tentatively increased
from $900 to $1800. This acts to the
benefit of the student. since the
Pedagogue could then be obtained
without a further charge by a pos-
sessor of a student tax rather than,
us this year, by paying a dollar in
addition to the purchase of a stu-
dent tux.

In addition to cutting $500 froru
the M.A.A. budget because of the
discontinuance of baseball from the
college sport program. a cut of $375
was made.

The question of whether or not
(Continual on page II. column 2)

New Budget May Include
Next Student Directory

Nicholas Morslllo. '42, Editor of
the 10-11-1in 1)irm'tory, says that
tcnliulva plans are being considered
to huvo the directory included in the
annual budget this year at $100 "If
the. students desire and back such
a change, they will be able to secure
their directories free of charge,"
Morsille stated

The directory has been a ﬁnancial
success to date. the profits from the
sales amounting to $5.50. From the
1300 copies printed. 1126 have been
sold. Copies of the directory are
still available in the Co-op.

Repairs Planned;
Programlncludes
Terrazzo Floors

The recently released allotment
from the New York state budget‘for
State College provides $17,000'to be
used for the installment of anew
chemistry laboratory; $4200 will be
spent on- new floors in the lower
corridors of Draper and Husted.
while the Commerce department
will receive $5,000 for new equip-
ment. The administration plans to
make the improvements sometime
during the summer recess.

Budget Is Not Cut

State College received the same
allotment from the New York State
budget as was received last year.
There has been no budget slash in
spite of the present emergency be-
cause this budget was submitted to
the state legislature for considera-
tion before the beginning of the
war. The exact ﬁgure of the State
College allotment as released by Dr.
John M. Sayles. President of the
College, is $453,345, to be used for
administration and operation ex-
penses. The budget for the entire
state was signed during the first
week of April by the Honorable
Herbert H. Lehman, Governor of
the State of New York.

Since it was necessary to allow
a portion of the funds for needed
improvements and repairs on the
campus, the allotment which pro-
vicled for staff salaries has been re-
duced to the minimum.

WIII Modernize Laboratories

The room. now used as a chem-
istry laboratory, is to be completely
made over. A new wooden floor will
replace the old one; and the room
is to be furnished with new labora-
tory tables. The lighting system
will be modernized to provide better
working conditions for students.

The administration plans to con-
tinue the project, started this year
in Husted Hall, of ﬂooring all the
college buildings with terrazzo. The
lower corridors of both Husted and
Draper will be rejuvenated with
new ﬂoors. It is thought that these
ﬁoors will prove an aid to cleanli-
ness—especially in the Annex area.

The outside of the college campus
will take on a new appearance with
shrubber'y planted in front of sev-
eral of the buildings. The residence
halls have already come in for their
share of the redecoratien program.
At least ﬁfty French lilac bushes
have been planted around the
dormitory.

Mysltania to Conduct
Elections on Tuesday

The elections for both class and
student association officers have
been scheduled for Tuesday. April 21
between 9 AM. and 4:30 PM. on
the balcony of the commons. On
Thursday the ﬁrst set of revotes
will be taken. The results of the
elections will be revealed Moving-
Up Day.

The height of the political battle
of State College was reached in to-
day's assembly when the candidates
for Student Association offices and
their respective managers delivered
their campaign speeches

The candidates who were heard
this morning are President. Howard
Lynch and Don Venus. seniors;
