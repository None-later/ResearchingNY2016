Mumow States
Ideas on Dancing

by Jeanette Shay

State students might have appre-
ciated Barton Mumaw's perform-
ance more if they had realized that
he went without his dinner Wed-
desday night just so that he might
entertain them. No, it wasn’t for
lack of time; it was to prevent his
being “bogged” down. He never eats
before a performance, his only sus-
tenance being a glass of honey
which he drinks thirty minutes be-
fore he goes on.

Mr. Mumaw’s reason for going in-
to the dancing field is the same old
story, he “always wanted to dance.”
Dancing in his opinion embodies a
knowledge of science, of math, of
history, and of all the other arts.
“It brings the whole of life together
in one spot,” he declared.

With so much emphasis being
placed now on physical ﬁtness for
defense, Mr. Mumaw sees in danc-
ing a means of gaining this ob-
jective. “In addition the dancer
derives beneﬁt from the overtones
of spiritual value. One cannot dance
without feeling something,” he said.

Inspiration for the creation of
a dance may come from any direc-
tion according to Mumaw. He may
be stimulated by a painting, a poem,
a strain of music, or even a costume.
After the inspiration a dance may
be created in as short a time as an
hour while others may take months
or even years.

When asked to tell what he thinks
about the future of dancing, Mu-
maw said, "Right now we're in a
hell of a fix." He is fearful of the
great amount of unfavorable publi-
city that has been given to dancing
in newspapers throughout the coun-
try. However he hopes that this
will serve as a stimulation since it
is making dancers ﬁght all the
harder for recognition.

“I think all arts should be pre-
served in war time," he declared,
“for art is one thing by which a
country is remembered."

Budget

(Continued from page 1, column 1,)
the Directory should be included in
the college budget was considered,
but it was desided that this problem
would have to be decided in As—
sembly by the Student Association.

The W.A.A. Handbook was elim-
inated from the budget, thus cutting
the W,A.A. appropriation by an ad-
ditional $230. Since Press Bureau
had to be given $35 extra in Janu-
ary of this year, their appropriation
was increased this ycar. P.T.E.B.
was also given an increase of $10 in
their appropriation.

However, it must be emphasized
that this budget was only tentative
and that the budget must be ap—
proved by the Student Association.

State Radio Guild To Present Drama Over WABY

The story flashes to the haunted
Forbes Mansion, complete with
ghosts, and we find Miriam Quinlan,
’45, as the beautiful heroine (Alice
Forbes) in this drama. Morris Ger-
ber, '43, is the villain (Dunshun)
who was the unsuccessful suitor for
Alice’s hand two year’s previous.
Nick Morsillo, '42, plays the part of
the devoted husband whom Alice
loves “more than anyone".

The plot progresses as the dis-
gruntled Dunshun frequents the
punch bowl at the Forbes’ New
Forbes Mansion, "1 “advishe” him Year’s Eve party, and as he refuses
not to proceed ulo to road in the to dance with anyone but the “rav-
dark. ishing" Alice. Dunshun and Dick

The State College Radio Guild
will go on the air Monday at 4
PM. over Station WABY (1360 k.)
with an original folk-drama written
by Byron Benton, ’43.

Benton narrates the background
for this drama and sets the scene
for Paul Der Ohannesian, ’45, and
Rolf Toepfer, ’43, drunks, who start
celebrating New Year’s Eve at six-
thirty in the afternoon. Paul and
Rolf warv ’ hn Luber, '45, about

Forbes start quarreling over who is
to dance the Midnight Minuet with
Alice. Frivolous Mrs. Blake (Ellen
Swartout, ’43) and malicious Mrs.
Anderson (Josephine Trumbull, ’42)
add spice to the thickening plot.
Comes the quarel between husband
Dick and rival Dunshun. Steel
flashes. Alice the wife rushes in,
little-fellow Junior clutched to her
breast; she screams—

“Listen in to find if Dunshun
kills husband Dick, or if Dick
Forbes rallies in time to save his
home".

Hale Plans Retirement From State;
To Teach One Year At Wesleyan

by Janet Baxter

U “Naturally I've enjoyed working
With State students, or I wouldn’t
regret leaving so much. I think
that sums up my feelings very well.
You know we scientists and mathe-
maticians aren‘t very good at ex-
pressing our sentiments.” With these
words, Dr. Clarence Hale, Professor
of Physics at State since 1911, bids
farewell to his duties here. He is one
of State's four oldest faculty mem-
bers in point of service.

Following this school year, Dr.
Hale will go to Middletown, Con-
necticut, where he will serve as vis-
iting professor for one year. Since
he has at least one more year of
teaching ahead of him, he does not
feel as if he were actually retiring.
“Instead. I feel as if I were going
on to a new job,” said Dr. Hale. He
added that he and his wife do not
Intend to give up their Albany home,
but expect to return following his
year at Wesleyan.

Going to Connecticut is like re-

 

turning home to Dr. Hale, since he
is. a Connecticut native. He received
his BS and MS. degrees at Wes-
lcyau. and served as instructor in
physical chemistry there from 1906-
1908. His Doctor of Philosophy de-
gl‘cc was conferred on him at Cor-
nell University, where he has also
taught during several summer ses-
sions.

' Dr. Hale is undoubtedly the most
familiar figure in the Physics lab-
oratory of Huested, and there is
ample evidence to justify his long
service here. His most outstanding
scientific contribution was his work
ill the development of the Perani-
l-lnlc Gauge, an instrument for
mcuslh'lng extremely low air pres-
sure.

Dr. Halo is also the President of
Albany's Monarch Club. Dr. John
M. Snylcs. President of the College,
sold [but there would be a faculty
(llllllt'l‘ given as a formal farewell
to Dr. I-lnlc, although no deﬁnite
doic has been set as yet.
