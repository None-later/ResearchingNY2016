' CARL MITCHELL

In keeping with the trend of sports
curtailment in American colleges
comes the announcement that MAA
has, decided to abolish freshman
basketball when next year rolls
around.

This does not necessarily mean
that the fresh will not be able to
participate in basketball. but that
MAA will not give the sport its
ﬁnancial support due to the de-
creased male enrollment expected.

However, just as we predicted
a short time ago, there is a great
possibility—that freshmen will have
to be used on the varsity outfit in
order to pull the team up to full
collegiate strength.

An interview with Coach G. Eliot
Hatﬁeld reveals that, if necessry,
he will use any freshman who comes
up to varsity standards. This un-
precedented step is actuated by the
fact that other colleges are follow-
ing similar measures.

Page Basketball

It's regretable that many of the
present sports fans will not be
around next year to see State's
basketeers go into action with some
of the finest competition available.

Due to the efforts of Coach ﬂat-
field over a period of years, State
has at last carded a game with the
Union College Dutchmen. In the
past the Sehoneetadians have
been reluctant to engage in sports
with State.

Another extra-special feature of
the basketball schedule is the in-
augural of basketball games with an-
other Metropolitan quintet. Cooper-
Union, a New York Technical col-
lege will stop-over for a game with
State on its Northern tour. Cooper-
Union is a highly rated outfit.

Bull Session Sports

While carrying on an informal
discussion with some of State’s wide-
awake National League followers
the following took place:

“The Dodgers would stand a
better chance in their opening
games if those three men were not
suspended for ‘conduct unbecom-
ing to Dodgers’.”

Said the pert little girl nearby,
“What did they do—tlp their hats
to a lady?”

The payoff in reality comes with
the following story. which has been
checked and found authenticated:

A girl from Rider College was
invited to attend Soiree. When
she arrived at Union Station she
could not find her man. When
she called up his fraternity. the
lad on the phone gave directions
to take a taxi to their house. and
then added as an afterthought—
“better bring a baseball bat to
heat off the wolves."

Snow Delays Start
Ol'Soitball League

Due to Sophomore Soiree’s snow-
storm last weekend. the start of in-
tramural softball has been post-
poned until next Monday. April 20.
This is one week ahead of last year's
opening day

Regis Hammond and Bill Mars-
land are in charge of the league.
They have arranged a 28-game
schedule for the eight teams com-
posing the league. Each team will
play against each of the others
once. Permission has been given to
use the diamond in front of Page
Hall. Hammond has announced
that "as things are planned now. we
will play at least three afternoons
of the week—more if possible. The
ﬁrst game will begin at 4:30 and
the second at 6:30 PM. Final ar-
rangements will be completed by
Monday."

War Reduces Men's Athletics,-

 
Sea's'On Thursday
Brauner Will Cut Squad

To Six Men Tomorrow

The first match of the season for
the tennis squad will take place
Thursday against Plattsburg Normal
School at Ridgeﬁeld Park. Captain
Hank Brauner feels that the State
men available will provide adequate
competition for the invaders.

With the recent improvement of
weather conditions, the tennis team
has taken to the Ridgefield courts
for its practice sessions during the
past week.

The three certain berths are occu-
pied by Brauner and Harry Kensky.
the only veterans who have re-
turned; and Fran Mullin, the fresh-
man who showed up so well in last
fall’s frosh tournament.

After Hank has selected the other
three team men, a ladder will.be
drawn up, which includes those who
did not get a berth. The top six
men on this ladder will compose the
team. The others may move up by
defeating the man above; and may
even work up to a team position.
Men who do not have a ladder posi-
tion may gain one by beating one
of those in one of the lower rungs.

Siena Loses to
State's Bowlers

State's intramural bowling champs
added another feather to their re-
spective caps by defeating Siena
College last Wednesday, 2372 to 2262.
This win avenges the defeat suffered
at Siena’s hands earlier in the sea-
son. The match was rolled on
Schade's alleys.

James Gillan was the hot man of
the afternoon. smashing the pins for
a 224 high single. He also garnered
the high total honors with a neat
541. He was closely pressed by Fran
Mullin who toppled 520 pins for his
triple. Top scores for the opposition
were earned by R. Sherwood, who
piled up a grand total of 489 pins,
including a 177 single.

WAA Plans Elections
At Polls Next Week

Elections for Women’s Athletic
Association officers will be held
Monday. April 20th. Lois Haﬂey
and Winifred Jones are competing
for the presidency.

Candidates for the office of vice-
president are Marjorie Ackley, Jane
Greenmun and Marie Luberda. Due
to a revision in the WAA constitu-
tion the position of Office Manager
has become an elective one for the
first time.

This office carries such numer-
ous responsibilities that WAA coun-
cil found it to be as important as
that of secretary or treasurer. Teddy
Jay and Leda LaSaile are can-
didatcs.

Competition for the scerctaryship
is divided among Helen Bushnell,
Mr ry Now. Mary Sanderson and
Leah Tischler

Contestants for the position of
treasurer are Adele Bucci, Kay De—
Kine. Kit lierdman. and Jean Kaf-
a.

Nominees for the job of song-
lcadcr are Marjorie Breunig, Peggy
Dec, Pat Frey and Joan Smith.

GINNY POLHEMUS

“If winter comes, can spring be
far behind." So said somebody
(Shelley, I am told). but what hap-
pens when winter comes and goes,
but comes back again?

However. optimistic WAA has
crossed its fingers, said a few prayers
for cooperation from the gods in
charge of the weather, and has in-
augurated its spring sports season.
As Shirley says. “physical fitness is
our aim”—“our” referring to the
femmes of State, and the country as
well. The bill of activities offered to
the local gals includes softball, bad-
minton, archery, golf, swimming,
riding and tennis.

Congrats, Dorm A!

A little belatedly, this column of-
fers its congratulations to the un-
defeated Dorm A team, which gar-
nered a silver cup and the WAA
championship. Last year this team
was a leading contender for a ﬁrst
place tie with the champs, Dorm B,
but through a misunderstanding
showed up for its last game forty-
ﬂve minutes late. This tardineSs
caused a forfeit to their rivals.
However, their unbeaten campaign
this year has certainly made up for
it. Congratulations!

More Felicitations

As a contrast to the lukewarm
reception to bowling last year, the
recent bowling tourney swept the
college. Psi Gamma won a beautiful
new trophy as a reward for showing

its superiority in the highly con-
tested matches in the Inter-house
Bowling League. Congratulation go
to the team as a whole and the
individual members for their taking
the individual honors as well.

Emphasis On WAA Sports

by Ray Verrey

The war and the draft are steadily
taking their toll. Men's athletics in
State College are bound to take a
sharp drop next year, due to the
lack of men, and if the war con-
tinues. they will be severely ham-
pered for the duration.

Some of our basketball competi-
tors. Clarkson, RPI, Brooklyn Poly,
and Pratt, will not suffer a lack of
athletes because of the draft since
their technical courses exempt their
students from the draft until they
ﬁnish college.

Next year Coach Hatﬁeld will
have to draw from intramural
squads in order to fill out varsity
basketball berths On the other
hand. the war has stressed the need
of sports for stronger and healthier
bodies which should prove a boom
for intramural activity

Though not many athletes — or
men for that matter—are expected
in next year’s freshman class, the
intramural program should be ex-
panded in order to keep State’s men
active in sports.

This is a serious problem facing
intramural council and MAA. Men’s
athletics must undergo a change for
the duration.

As physical education men are be-
ing taken into the service, there is
an acute shortage of coaches and
physical instructors in high schools.
Couldn't State revive a “Theory of
Coaching" course in order to pre-
pare prospective teachers for coach-
ing jobs? It was done in State
College in 1918, why not now?

by Shirley Wurz
Maybe it's the decrease in the
male population of State College
which gives the girls more time for
sports or maybe it’s just the increas-

ing interest of American women in-

physical ﬁtness—but the list of thos'e
in WAA is growing day by day. ,

While MAA is facing the problem
of decreased membership, WAA
faces that of increased responsi-
bility. As Anna Cattuti says,
“with fewer parlor games, the girls
will have to turn to outdoor sports
for recreation.”

Physical fitness, important at any
time, is especially important in war
time. Every girl who isn’t active in
WAA isn’t necessarily a physical
wreck but those who are active in
WAA are for the most part in bet-
ter shape. (No cracks. please.)
Alice Marble, National Director of
Physical Education, is in favor of a
program of active sports for every
woman in the United States. This
is the part that WAA must play in
our national emergency. Every girl
at State should participate in at
least one sport. WAA offers a va-
ried program which should appeal
to every feminine fan.

What a place State will be—with
feminine Amazons bouncing health-
ily around the institution. After
all, many of our girls will lose their
main extra-curricular activity when
the men go marching away. And
their interests might better turn to
archery and badminton than to “sit-
ting under the apple tree wit
somebody else." '

Committee Plans
Aviation Classes

For State, Milne
Five Members Attend

Conlcrence at Syracuse

Dr. John M. Sayles, President of
the College, has appointed a faculty
committee for the purpose of infus-
ing aviation consciousness into the
curriculum of State College and the
Milne High School. Dr. Robert W.
Frederick, Principal of Milne, is
chairman of the committee; Dr. D.
V. Smith, Professor of Social Studies,
Dr. Ralph G. Clausen, Assistant Pro-
fessor of Science, Dr. Carleton A.
Moose, Assistant Professor and
Supervisor in Science, and Mr.
George M. York. Professor of Com-
merce. are committee members.

The committee met Wednesday
morning to plan an “air-minded”
program. Dr. Frederick outlined the
points taken up at the meeting:
(1) Get all the available books in
the field and place them in the
school libraries; (2) Method of in-
fusing aviation consciousness into
each course; (3) Problems of more
specific new courses which will be
taken up later.

The five committee members at-
tended a conference at Syracuse
University on Saturday. Five rep-
resentatives from each teacher—
training institution in New York
State met to discuss the place of
aviation in the modern world and
its implications for teacher educa-
tion. Dr. Orton. head- of Stockton
College in California, delivered the
keynote address. He stressed the
fact that the present war will be
won in the air. and that secondary

Forum to Elect

Officers Tuesday

At the Forum meeting planned for
Tuesday at 3:30, many lines of busi-
ness are in order. First of all elec-
tions for the positions of speaker,
clerk and treasurer will be held.
However, for those who cannot at—
tend the mecting. a table will be set
up in the lowor hall of Draper to
enable them (.0 vote.

After the elections have been dis-
penst with. the Forum group will
break up into three sections: one
section to discuss whether or not the
United States can take the offensive
in the war; another to discuss
charges of inefficiency and waste in
the Federal government; and a
third to discuss the war legislation
before Congress.

The Forum also plans to draw up
a list of all those former State Col-
lege students who are in the service
of the country. in the army. navy.
marines, etc.. and to mail to those
former students papers and mogu-
zines telling them what is going on
at State College.

Since this is the fifth year of the
Forum at State, a committee will
be organized to evaluate the work
done by the Forum in its five years
of existence. The plan for the
Forum was uriglncted by Dr. Robert
Ricnow to supplement the work
done in his Political Science classes.

'Pirates' Success; Budget Blues -- An Editorial 7

We have a job before us today; the jobof seeing that we
are treated fairly. We must make sure that our money is
being spent the way we want it to be spent. By instituting
a uniform set of books we have gone a long way toward
cleaning out our ﬁnancial cellar; now we must ﬁnish 'the
project by seeing that the right amount of money goes into
those books. Last year Student Association was hoodwinked
into passing an oversized budget. This year the State
College NEWS is making every effort to see that this does
not reoccur. This time there can be no itemized budgets left
at home. There can be no evasion of the issue. The entire
assembly must take it upon itself to know the fact and to

Songs Outrank

Dramatic Eilorts

By Bernard Perlman

Despite the information in the ,

program, last night's performance
did not begin until Jean McAllister
made her first appearance upon the
stage. Both the singer and acting
lacked conviction and motion, albeit
the motley costumes of the pirate
chorus and virginal maidens pre-
sented interesting tableaux at times.

As a whole. the singing of the
evening, both solo and chorus parts.
was of an exceptional nature. al-
though the opening was too tame for
a pirate band. It wasn't until the
second act that Max Reeves found
his voice. but Jean McAllister was
surer of herself than ever before.
The stage business of her ﬁrst solo,
Poor Wandering One, demonstrated
immediately that she had matured
measurably in control of her voice
and manners. The talented if some-
what gawky sensation of last year’s
Pimnfore is now a seasoned trouper,
having full command of any part
she essays.

Brooks Roberts, as the pirate
Chieftain. acted most authentically.
as did Ruth, the bane of the pirates’
lives. However, their contributions
were antithetical, Roberts acting
the part and singing as best he could.
with Schlesinger doing a good job
on the music. Kunz’ entrance was
impatiently awaited and right roy-
ally received—and rightly so. There
was a ﬂavor and style to George's
performance as the Major-General
which did much toward providing
the Operetta with the drive and
verve so characteristic of Gilbert
and Sullivan.

Dingman’s comic eﬁorts were pre-
sented so sparingly as to leave the
audience desiring still more. Except
for an understandable reluctance in
the opening numbers, the chorus did
a uniformly excellent job throughout
the evening, emphasizing however.
that for this first night at least. the
singing on everybody's part quite
outshone the acting. Too often. Dr.
Candlyn and the student directors,
in this case, Hirsh and Lee. have
had their contriinitions slighted.
Last night's performance. by its
cohesion. pace, and musical excel—
lcncc, was good evidence of the con-
siderable talents of the triumvh'ntc
in command.

act with justice toward itself.

It is time that the students of this college became aware
of the fact that they hold the power of allocation of Student
Association funds. Last year the budget in many cases was
“liberal” to say the least. Budgets were padded and passed
because the students had little time in which to discuss the
budget and little information on which to base their discus-
sion. This year there is no excuse for the mistake of last
year. Today in its regular editorial column, the NEWS has
printed the tentative itemized budgets of all the major
activities. Thus you have all the information in front of
you. Two Association meetings are being devoted to budget

hearings.

As you will notice when you examine the budgets on page
two, there has been a deﬁnite effort on the part of most
organizations to cut their requests. However, the NEWS
feels that some organizations have not cooperated in this
effort. It is the task of today’s meeting to ferret out these
organizations and items, and to cut or eliminate them. It
must be understood that what the Association says today
can only carry the powers of recommendation, but the
organization that will not weigh seriously the Association’s
recommendation in the budget hearings during the coming
week is indeed biting the hand which feeds it. Furthermore
the organizations which have already cooperated in slashing
their appropriation will see to it that the offenders toe the

line.

It will be noted that several of the items reproduced on
page two of the NEWS are set aside with an asterisk. These
are items which the NEWS would like explained to the
satisfaction of Student Association.

 

State Gets 'Sfuck' by Fast Sales Talk
From War Stamp Backers Aney & Co.

Stump collecting is indeed the
latest fad at State College. Investi—
gation and observation have shown
that this is becoming a favorite
student hobby—that is. the collection
of war stunnis. The sale of war
stamps started last Monday noon in
the lower hall of Draper; already
the sales hiWc reached the $47 mark.

Trees Aney. '44. super stamp sales-
glrl and originator of the intensi-
flcd student drive says. “I think this
drive has been successful because
many students have been willing to
sacrifice desserts in order to invest
their money in the war stumps. It
certainly show their patriotism.”

One hundred and fifty have joined
the ranks of the stamp collectors;

 

Dorm Will Usher in Spring
With Tuxedo-less Formal

Don't bother taking your
tuxes out of the moth bulls,
boysl The Pierce Hull girls are
entertaining from 9 P. M, to
1 P. M. tomorrow night, but
their annual spring dance is
semi-forum] liiis year.

Since old man weather foiled
the sophomores. it's up to the
dorm girls to usher in the spring
season, and they are planning
to do just that. The theme will
be a strictly feminine one. “No
red, white. and blue for u
chancel" declared Emily Bluiscr.
'48, chairman of the dance.
Pink lights will play on the
faces of the dancers and they
are guaranteed to make the girls
beautiful—or rather, more beau-
tifui.

Music for the affair will be
furnished by Charlie Randell,
formerly of the Edgewood. who
has just come back from a suc-
cessful southern tour. His hand
handles both sweet and swing
exceptionally well.

 

Miss Aney and her cohorts person-
ally distribute books for 10 and 25
cent stamps and even “lick” the
stamps upon request. Besides this.
those who have begun their stump
collecting previous to the drive inl-
tiatcd by the students have added
to their albums by patronizing the
little table located in front 01’ the
P. 0.

Miss Aney urges that all students
make an attempt to buy at least one
stamp a week.

Tentative Budget
Will be Debated;

Cut is Imminent.

AssemblyHearingReaults
Will Dictate Cut Policy

After two organizational budget
hearings in the past two Weeks,
tentative budgets have been com-
piled for all organizations and will
be presented to the Student Associa-
tion for discussion today.

This assembly discussion is the
first of two such hearings planned.
The instructions which come from
Student Association today will be.
reconsidered by organizations in
further hearings in Room 28 of
Richardson during the coming week.
The revised budgets will then be
returned to Student Association for
further consideration and possible
acceptance.

Representatives of extra-curricu-
lar activities realized that although
the costs of many items in their
budgets have risen considerably and
although the administration expects
an enrollment of only 900 students
next year. it would be unwise to
raise the student tax tickets higher
than $14.00.

Somewhere in this budget, $1325
still remains to be cut, unless the
Student Association votes to raise
the tax to $15. The total amount to
be appropriated has been set at
$12,600. but the totals of the tenta-
tive budget are $13,193.75.

Seniors Must Buy
College Diplomas

Dr. Milton G. Nelson, Dean of the
College. recently disclosed arrange-
ments made by the administration
for the purchase of diplomas and
teaching certificates for the Seniors.

This rear the cost for embossing
the d.piomas amounts to $2.35 per
person. This amount will be paid by
the students themselves, the money
being collected by the Treasurer of
the Senior Class. Benson Tybring.
All seniors must pay $2.35 to their
treasurer not later than May 15.

Also. by state law, each person
must pay $3 for a teaching certifi—
cate. This must be paid to Mr.
Clarence Dcyo. Treasurer of the Col—
lege. by May .15.
