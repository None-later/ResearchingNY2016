STATE COLLEGE NEWS, FRIDAY, APRIL 24, 1942

 

 

By Herb Lenckor

Keep ’Em Falling . . .‘ Don’t forget that every war
stamp you (my helps to furnish planes for the pilots,
bullets for the gunners, bombs for the bombadiers,
and ﬁre extinguishers for the navigators. . . .

Wendell Cady. last semester’s scribe of this column,
writes that he has been accepted by the Air Corps,
and is awaiting call. Due to a lack of training facil-
ities, all enlistments have been temporarily suspended.
Cady is working at the Locomotive Works in Schenec-
tady, using the interim to feather his pockets with
shekels. . . .

0f Men and Mooses

Bunny Ryerson’s big brother Bill. who was graduated
way back in '40, is in the diplomatic service, serving as
Secretary to the Naval Attache at the Embassy in
Havana. Cuba.

Bill’s job is to interpret Spanish, and he works
anywhere from 16 to 24 hours a day on the job. One
day he was forced to give up his dinner hour and
worked 25. Someone has to be on duty at the Embassy
every minute, so it looks as if Bill was the last Secre-
tary appointed.

However, the job has its advantages. affording a
free study of Cuba, as well as a knowledge of the
“inside” of governmental affairs. Favorite recreation
of the blond giant of the Ryerson clan is listening to
the Cuban Symphony Orchestra. which Bill claims is
really excellent.

Helmuth Schoen reports that Dutch Island, where
he is now stationed. is full of Mooses. and the standard
bearers of Teddy Roosevelt, like the old boy himself,
are not at all shy. The soldiers are considering produc-
ing a play . . . “The Moose Who Came To Dinner." . . .

The Fault, Dear Brutus?

As part of his election platform, Don Vanas advo-
cated a change in the War Activities Council, bring-
ing it more closely under the supervision of the
Student Association.

Now this year the S. A. has done nothing about the
matter. In fact, it was Forum which started the
whole idea of a War Activities Program, and this in
itself is a blot on the record of the Chief Executive
of the student body. who passed up a splendid chance
to exhibit dynamic leadership.

While a modiﬁcation of the present council might
increase its value. any radical change in its organiza-
tion should be seriously resisted by the students—
and probably would be resisted by the administration.

The present set-up is ideal for efficient cooperation
of the students and the administration, but any drastic
change will destroy this efficiency. and perhaps—a
fate worse than death—turn the council into a log
road, to be driven over at will by State's political
machines. . . .

Surely Don, who himself has felt the impact of a
political machine (driven by one motor, and not two
as he imagines) would never wish the War Activities
Council to degenerate in this manner. . . .

With Malice Towards None

Best news of the week was the 11th hour nomination
of Butch Feigenbaum to challenge the continuance of
the “Virginia Dynasty" in the class of 1943.

Now the powerful clique that has control of the
Junior class has been every efficient. and no one can
question their sincerity. However. we are ﬁghting to
maintain democracy, and that includes a two party
system.

When the presidency of a class of over 250 persons
is about to be handed uncontested to the prime min-
ister of a group, it just ain't good. Let’s hope Feigcn-
baum offered a strong opposition—the tonic without
which our democratic system can never survive. . . .

War Fronts

‘ —by Feigenbaum

The biggest mystery of the war: Where did the
American planes which bombed Japan last week come
from and where did they go? No one seems to know,
and those who do know aren’t telling. But who cares?
Americans don’t want to know where the planes took
011’ from or where they landed. They just want to
know when Tokyo and Yokohama are going to be
bombed again. Regardless of reports coming out of
Japan to the contrary, the damage was heavy and the
Japanese are scared.

The British Commandos had a ﬁeld day one night
last week. Shooting the one German sentry who
challenged them, they landed on Boulogne on the
French coast, shot the place up, damaged anything
they 'could get their hands on, and returned to their
boats with only a few minor wounds. Only after the
Commandos were on their way home did the Germans
send up flares and help signals. The fact that they
were only challenged by one lone sentry on that part
of the French coast which is nearest to England is
signiﬁcant, for when the British start looking for a
weak spot in Mr. Schickelgruber's armor in which to
open up a second front they may ﬁnd it nearer home
than they expected.

The Japanese are copying Berlin’s style. The little
yellow Aryans are making peace overtures while they
are on the top. The United States government warns
all Americans not to be taken in by these big-hearted
o ers.

The British and Chinese troops in Central Burma
are unable to stop the Jap drive toward India. The
Qlli‘es are ﬁghting a delaying action and slowly falling
ac .

Corregidor is taking a heavy pounding from the big
guns which the Japs have set up on Bataan, but the
fortress is still holding out.

CARL MITCHELL

For the ﬁrst time in the history of
State College, the men can boast a
golf team.

Because of the removal of base-
ball, Coach Hatﬁeld has undertaken
to form and coach a group of in-
terested men who will comprise the
current, precedent-shattering team.

This is indeed a welcome addition
to the State sports curriculum. Now
the mighty mites of State will have
an outlet for the excessive energy
contained in vitamin-ﬁlled bodies.

Since the trend among underclass-
men is for greater sports collabora-
tion between the sexes, it might be a
good idea to plan a match between
the best in the men’s and women's
divisions.

One person (name withheld) said
the plan might not be accurate in
terms of validity since the local golf
courses have too many shady spots!
The Royal Order, Etc.

All members of the Royal Order
of the Ebony Sphere are hereby
requested to drop a note to Corres-
ponding Secretary Dolores Brege
containing information as to the ap-
proximate date of entrance. reason,
and class year.

A message to those members who
will ﬁnd themselves in some branch
of the armed forccsdparticularly
the Air Corps--Will you try to form
in your contingent. a branch of the
Ebony Sphere Club? There should
be many bellicose individuals who
will qualify at once. For further
information see mewdon‘t know
where, don't know when—but try.

Ping pong hit the high spot dur—
ing the recent match featuring
Dickson and Coombs versus Stolbof
and Bernhardt. The spectators liter-
ally drapcd from the curtains.

One practical individual who was
too lazy to clean his teeth. simply
held a tooth brush in front of his
mouth and watched the ball!

The intramural softball schedule
ﬁnally got underway last Wednes-
day. Pottcr Club, defending champs,

Over Plattsburg
In Season Opener

With one victory under their belts,
State’s tennis squad is looking for-
ward to their match this afternoon
with R.P.I. This match is considered
the toughest one on the schedule by
Captain Hank Brauner.

Yesterday, the netsmen breezed
through to an easy 6-1 win over a
weak Plattsburg Normal squad. The
only loss was the doubles match.
This was the hardest fought match
of the day, going the full distance of
three sets.

The results:

Singles:

Kensky vs. Grover........
Brauner vs. Fessette.
Mullin vs. Potter
Finer vs. Allard ...... ..

 

Doubles:
Kensky and Brauneigvs.

Johnston Get: Stuck

Last week—end in a cold
drizzle, thirteen of State’s out-
door girls trecked the well
known trail out to Chatham to
Camp Johnston. The camp
looked a little crumby, so Satur-
day morning the giris decided
to creosote the outside. Accord-
ing to reports. it was an awful
job. But the results were worth
the efforts.

Miss Johnston arrived Satur-
day, and got her car stuck in the
mud. A11 thirteen girls pushed
and pulled with all their might,
but the car was still stuck.
Finally. they went down to
Chatham for the tow car. Much
to their disgust, the tow car
extracted the car with one slight
tug.

Everyone agrees that the
week-end was wonderful. Great
food, a great rest, and a great
time made it very successful.

 

With physical education taking an
important role in this fast-changing
world, we, as prospective teachers
and community leaders, should give
the subject due consideration. Let's
not just think about it. What can
be done about it?

New York State supports but one
college for training physical educa-
tion students —— Cortland State
Teachers. However, the only two
other departments in the school are
health and elementary education.
The opportunities given to a physi-
cal education student are very slim
in that he can not qualify to teach
in secondary schools as a. minor to
his physical education course.

And to top it all off, the draft
took better than 75% of the physical
education men that graduated from
Cortland last year. only recently
have these students been deferred—
and that is only until they ﬁnish
school, at which time they may still
be inducted.

It's true that private colleges and
universities. such as Syracuse U. and
lthaca College, are putting out
physical education graduates. but the
number is compartively small. High

the new trend toward betterphysl-‘r
cal development and take steps to'
meet the demand for month this
ﬁeld? ‘ '

There are probably two possible
ways through which this could be
accomplished. The state could give
grants to colleges and universities
already training physical education
instructors. whereby these schools
would allow students from New
York State to follow this course
tuition-free. Or a physicial educa-
tion department could be added to
such a state-supported collgee as
State College.

Progressive educators see the de-
mand for physical instructors.
Progressive legislators should do
something about it.
