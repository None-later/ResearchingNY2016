, , SessiOn at State Col-

begin‘ July 0 and will con-

til; August 15. Many courses

vs boon added to the summer cur-
um which do not appear in the

" session. The greatest change,

however,_has been made in the pro-

 of the Social Studies depart-
ment.
‘__“In regard to the Social studies

. ‘ department", Dr. Milton 6. Nelson,
'  of the College, stated, “the

trend has been away from the study
of more history alone to the study
of the social sciences, philosophy of
democracy, community organization,
sociology, development of family and
of marriage institutions, etc.

Add Social Sciences

“With this'trend in mind, numer-
ous courses have been added to the
summer curriculum dealing with the
social sciences. These courses will
not be added to the regular session
curriculum, however. Some exam-
ples are: History fill—Development
of Democracy as 9. Philosophy and a
Way of Life; History 150—Recon-
struction of the Social Studies; Soc.
loo—The Family; History 126—In-
tellectual Backgrounds of Modern
Culture; History lza—Machine Age
Culture; History 127—The Rise of
Autocracy.

During the summer session, a can-
didate for the degree of Master of
Science, who has completed the re-
quirements established by the state
for a teacher of commercial subjects,
may select commerce as his field
for graduate specialization. This is
not possible under the four year

. plan now in effect for the Class of

'42 in regular session.
Literature Emphasized

Some new courses have been added
to the curriculum in English. These
courses emphasize the literature of
the United States and emphasize the
evaluation of literature for adoles-
cents. The new courses are: English
28 —- Literature for Junior - Senior
High School students; English 100—-
The Middle West, Its Culture and
Literature; English 101—Literature
of Shakespeare’s London; English
127—Studies in Poetry.

In the science department, a
course is planned which will be
entirely devoted to laboratory and
field work in biology—no lecture
periods. Dr. Clausen will teach this
course and the explanation in the
catalogue states: “Hip-boots will be
of special value."

By Gordon Dustin

When the intellectuals of the
New York State Debate Conference
at Skidmo’re College could not per-
ceive an impostor in their midst, it
immediately became apparent to the
members of State’s debate team now
relatively simple it would be for any-
one of ulterior motives to do equally
as well on a larger scale.

Amidst a tremendous ovation, Ira
Hirsh, '42, introduced Glen Wal-
rath, '42, to the gullible young rep-
resentatives of every college and uni-
versity of New York State—not as
Glen Walrath but as Senor Gleno
Gomez, an exchange student from
Venezuela. Proceeding to the speak-
ers' platform, Senor Gomez ejected
a‘ conglamoration of curses, abstract
questions,rand insults to every one
present. The audience was amazed;
they sat spellbound listening to each
individual syllable with admiration.
As Glen returned to his seat, he was
cheered, applauded and respected.
The audience had not understood
anything Senor Gomez had said—
he spoke in Spanish.

schools could make a contribution
in preliminary pilot training. “The
last shots in this war,” said Dr.
Orton “will be ﬁred by boys who are
now sophomores and Juniors in high
school."

In the second part of his speech,
Dr. Orton emphasised the signiﬁ-
cant place aviation has taken in the
life of today. Due to the mail sys-
tem, rapid communication, and
social effects, aviation's scope will be
similar to that of the automobile.
Its progress has brought about an
immediacy of relationship with
European countries, and has pro-
moted the study of foreign lan-
guages. After the war, Dr. Orton
said that aviation would have a
profound effect on everyone, and
influence housing, safety, juvenile
delinquency, and crime, as the auto-
mobile already has.

Newman PlansAnnual Trip
Candidates Introduced

At Newman Club’s meeting yester-
day at 3 :30 P. M. in the Lounge, plans
for the Annual Pilgrimage to the
Shrine of North American Martyrs
in Auriesvllle were discussed. Mae
Whiting, '43, is General Chairman of
the affair, which is scheduled for
May 1'7. Candidates for the New-
man offices next year were intro-
duced at the meeting.

A discussion on religious and
mental health was led by the Rev-
erend William Cahill, Professor of
Philosophy at the College of St.
Rose. Two honorary members, Miss
Agnes Futterer, Assistant Professor
of English at State, and Miss Mae
McCarthy, house mother of Newman
Hall, have been initiated by the
Newman Club Council.

Friday evening at a banquet for all
the debaters, and the hoax remained
unrevealéd throughout the follow-
ing day.

Glen, one of State's best on the
dance ﬂoor in the art of “modern
swing interpretation," strengthened
his reputation as a genuine Latin-
Amerlcan by performing with real-

istic Spanish grace the intricate

rhumbas, congas, and tangos which
are so illustrative of South America.

State College Students not only
created the humorous aspect, but
also provided the convention with
considerable aid in the formulation
of the important bills that were
considered. Saturday morning they
participated in the debate and
passage of four resolutions concern-
ing the economic, political, cultural
and military relations of the United
states and South America. After
complete drafting, they will be sub-
mitted to the United states Con-
gress and the state department at
Washington.

In appreciation of State students’
abilities, Shirley Wurz, ’43, was
elected secretary of the Committee
on Economics and Sol Greenburg
presided over the meetings of the
Committee on Military Affairs.

In Spanish Preparation

Speaking 'at the annual spring
meeting of the American Association
of Teachers of Spanish held at Syra-
cuse University last Saturday, Mr.
Roy Mosher, Supervisor of Modern
Languages of the State Education
Department reported on the in-
crease of Spanish in the high schools
of New York State. He declared,
“State College is doing a fine Job in
beginning to supply these teachers."

This meeting was the culmination
of Pan-American Week which com-
menced April 14. Dr. James W.

Spanish, accompanied Mr. Masher

Intersorority Plans

Navy Pins Sale
At Tonight's Ball

Luncheons, Vic Dances
To Climax Weekend

The Navy Relief Drive will make
its ﬁrst appearance in the Capital
District at the annual Intersorority
Ball to take place at the Aurania
Club tonight from 10 PM. to 2 AM.

To further illustrate the theme of
an all-out victory dance unneces-
sary expenditures have enabled the
bid to be fixed at the low price of
$1.75. All decorations will be elim-
inated save the traditional sorority
banners.

Navy Pins to Be Sold

Thus far the Navy Relief fund
has not yet begun in Albany. Mr.
William K. Stanford, Vice-President
of the Albany Chamber of Com-
merce, has agreed to the sale of
Navy Relief pins which may be pur-
chased at the door at a minimum
price of $1.00. All the money re-
ceIVed from the sale of the pins
will be given to the fund for aiding
the families of men in the navy,
coast guard, and marines, who have
been killed, lost, or injured in the
war. Once more, State College is
urged to refrain from buying cor~
sages to aid this intensive drive.

Freddie Gray and his orchestra
will furnish the music for the al-
fair. Gray, who comes from Sche-
nectady, is a well-known musician
in the Capital District.

The nine men and a girl in the
orchestra are noted, especially at
Union and Skidmore, as talented,
sophisticated artists.

In March they played for the
Freshman-Sophomore dance at Un-
ion College where they were receivod
with acclaim and their music was
declared “super.”

Both “Sweet and Swing"

The program will be a variety of
musical numbers including “sweet
and swing" for both dancing and
listening pleasure. Helen Lynn will
accompany the orchestra as chiel‘
soloist.

Guests at the Ball will be Dr.
John M. Sayles and Mrs. Sayles,
Dr. Milton G. Nelson and Mrs. Nel-
son, and Miss Sara T. DeLaney.
Chaperones are: Mr. and Mrs. Paul
G. Bulger and Mr. and Mrs. James

AD Spring Play

Satire on Barrymores
By Kaufman- Ferber Team

by Trece Aney

 . . . you can even laugh. I have
always found that an inane laugh
covers all emergencies . . , Look at
your role ‘poeticaily' We’re
going to do this scene over and over
again until we get it right . . . You
shouldn't hurt your throat; I didn't
hurt my throat . . . Glare in your
best upstage manner . . . You are
supposed to go in the door; goodness
only knows if you ever exit .
Little more volume, Jo. You’re so
good we want to hear you . "

Thus Miss Agnes E. Futterer, As-
sistant Professor of English, con-
ducted her 13th rehearsal of The
Royal Family which is to be pre-
sented in Page Hall May 15 at
8:30 PM.

The play, produced by the Ad-
vanced Dramatics class, is a satire
on the Barrymore family. It pic—
tures the escapades of Tony (played
by Jim McFeeley, ’44) who is con-
stantly trying to escape the police
and the mobs that gather together
whenever he is expected to arrive on
the scene. He seems to have a fac-
ulty for getting mixed up in breach
of promise suits and letting his sis-
ter, Julie (played by Jane Curtis,
‘43), and manager ﬁnd a way out.
An excellent characterization is
done by Betty Barden, ‘43, who plays
the part of their old mother.

The play has one set throughout.
The scene, laid in a duplex apart-
ment in the East 50‘s in New York
City. The action takes place within
a period of a year.

This play was presented here
about eight years ago with Lucille
Hirsh playing the part of Fanny.
“People who saw the play at that
time considered it the funniest com—
edy we had ever put on," Miss Fut—
terer told the reporter. “One of its
line points is that it is an insight to
theatrical life that people wouldn‘t
get in any other way.”

Miss Futterer has had her share
of bad luck in producing the play.
June Melville, '43, one 01' the minor
leads. was sent home because of :In
appendicitis attack and may not be
able to continue her performance

Holstein, Bombard Become
Members of Naval Reserve

“Blood pressure o.k. Pulse
ﬁne. Heart going.”

In this case, the two lucky
recruits were Ed Holstein, '42,
and Owen Bombard, ’43. These
two passed their physical exam-
inations for entrance into V-7
and were sworn in as members
of the United States Naval Re-
serve.

Holstein will go into training
this summer; Boinbard will
have preliminary training dur-
ing the summer, but will be al-
lowed to return to college in the
Fall to complete his Senior year.

At the same time word has
been received that Class V-7 has
been extended for college Jun-
iors and Seniors. Since the clos-
ing of this classification in the
last of April, students have had
to apply under the V-l plan and
then transfer to V-‘l.

Criticisms Are Made
At Three Hearings;
WAA Is Questioned

The Student Association budget
for 1342-1943 will be formally sub-
mitted to the student body this
morning in assembly by Nick Mor-
sillo, ’42, Senior member of Finance
Board. With last week's motion
eliminating the Statesman from the
budget and the deletion of NSFA,
the budget ﬁgure now stands at
$12,552.75, $641 less than the original
sum. The removal of these two or-
ganizations places the price of stu-
dent tax tickets at approximately
$14 dollars, computed on a total en-
rollment of 900 students.

Despite the slash in the budget
figure, a large percentage of the
student body is still unsatisﬁed with
several items listed on the itemized
organization budgets published in
last week’s News, as was evidenced
in the hearings this week. Every
organization was called on to ex-
plain one or more items on its bud-
get.

Tax Price Discussed

“What difference does it make
whether We have a $14 or $15 stu-
dent tax?" was one of the questions
asked at Monday‘s hearing. Con-
sensus of opinion
indicated a lack
ol’ concern on the
part of the stu-
dents. However,
they felt that the
possibilities of
padding would be
greater on a bud-
get tired to re-
quire II  tax,
