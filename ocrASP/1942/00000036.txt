Dorm, AAUW Conﬂict;
Moles Hove Field Day.

By Betty Gravelle

What's your idea of a perfect
blackout situation? It may not fit
in with the motley events of Men-
day night's lights-out program, but
a lot of unusual situations cropped
up in State's various group houses.
For example -

Pierce Hall girls that night. There

army's conﬁdence and therefore
chose that particular time to meet.
The confused girls, wondering if this
were some celestial (or otherwise)
meeting-place, hesitated in aston-

Psi Gamma was caught in the
middle of choosing its next year's
vice-president, and a pack of cig-
arettes went through a mash ses-
sion in the process. Hank Ruback
found himself the sole male among
60 girls in the rec of Newman Hall,
while Rich Young held the fort at
Gamma Kap. And ﬁve young co-
eds held forth in a secluded spot,

State’s versatility, it must prove

Scotland Praises

Recent Blackout

Husted Hall's Facilities
Still Found Inadequate

“Albany’s fourth blackout found
State College completely cooperative
and prepared," reports Dr. Minnie
B. Scotland, Chief Air Raid Warden
and Assistant Professor of Biology.
Blackout procedure in the group
houses was followed without. mis-
hap and activities continued in the
college during the blackout. How-
ever, some light did show through
the blacked-out rooms on the sec-
ond floor of Husted Hall where dc-
fense classes were being held.

Dr. Scotland was attending a
meeting in the Ingle Room of Pierce
Hall when the blackout warning
sounded. She says, "I was extremely
impressed by the rapidity and order
with which the girls vacated their
rooms." She also praised the coop-
eration of the Sayles Hall men for
reporting a light in one oi" the upper
floors of Pierce.

As for blackout preparations in
the college, Dr. Scotland believes
that nothing more will be done until
next fall. Because the days are
longer at this tithe of the year and
because more activities take place
outdoors. blackout equipment is not
an absolute necessity.

Many Opporiun
To EnlislL in War

by Bernard Skolslty

To those males of the species who
are considering going to the aid of
their country. it seems advisable to
present a survey of the opportunities
in the service which are open to
them. A hasty choice without a
careful survey of the necessary
qualifications and without a thor-
ough knowledge of all opportunities
for war-time service may result in
total misplaccmcnt of man power.

The Civil Piioi training is divided
into two courses: elementary coursi-
and secondary course. The require-
ments for the cictncntat'y course are
