Club and the Ramblers were also
undefeated, each having two wins
and no losses going into their
am last ni ht.

g SIFS beatg Sayles Hall, Thomas
More, and College House in that
order. Max Reeves proved himself
the surprise of the new season as he
set down Sayles Hall with seven hits
and won 16-15. SLS, lacking two of
its regular players, committed num-
erous errors in the ﬁeld. i

In defeating Thomas Mares
green but enthusiastic team, SLS
banged out 25 hits to score 30 runs
as the Morians were held to five
runs. Reeves, pitching for SLS, al-
lowed only four hits and struck out
nine men.

College House provided SLS its
third victory by a 29 to 4 score.

WAA Moves
Baseball to Page

With a ﬁnal acquisition of the
front lawn for use on Tuesday,
Thursdays and Fridays for softball,
the WAA spring program of six
sports has gotten well under way.
Instead of playing in back of the
library, the girls will be able to
have organized teams in front of
Page Hall. Tuesday afternoon sev-
eral teams were formed for league
playing, with Sylvia Teft and Leah
Tlschler in charge.

Expand Archery Program

An expanded archery program has
been inaugurated by Honey Schoen
by trying to build up an urchcry
range in front of the library. Both
men and women have shown an iii-
creased interest in this sport, which
has proven highly popular in other
colleges. Monday and Wednesday
from 3:30 to 4:30 PM. are the hours.

Since the Washington Park Courts
have not opened. there will not be
enough time to acquire ten hours
credit. 'l‘hcrcforc, credit will be ob-
tained on a girl’s own time reported
to the captain.

Outdoor Courts Morde

Outdoor courts have been marked
in back of school for badminton
play. Captain Kay Devlne is plan-
ning a tournament which will be
played on Monday and Wednesday
afternoon.

Golf, under captain Ellen Holly,
who is a skilled player, is also ex-
panding its program. Practices will
be conducted in back of school on
Tuesdays and Thursdays from 3:00
to 4:00 P.M., and later the girls will
make the rounds on a local course.

Reminiscing in Sports

Have you noticed the pack of
waives that have been hungrin tak-

sports near hawrey. Some of the
bOider lads from the Albany area
now have started to pull up to the
curb with their newest retreads and
hang out the windows—drooling.

Kit Herdman was pitching a hot
game of softball. It was almost bell
time (no, we didn’t say bolle) when
she faced the situation With one on

Getting very excited, the little
girl tried to outfox her opponents
by making an unexpected toss to
catch the girl off second base. It
almost worked except the recipient

Ferocious Famine: of '45

“And another Freshman bit
the dust.” This according to
Mary Domann, captain, will be
the battle-cry of the Golden
Horde team in the rivalry soft-
ball game today. The stalwart
damsels of the class of ’44 have
forsworn their hot fudge sun-
daes and multitudinous cokes
for the past week in training
for this event.

“The Crimson Tide surges on
to victory,” says Nora Giavelli,
captain of the fresh team. With
a gleam of pride in her eyes, she
claims that her team could lick
its weight in sophomore men.
Thus, why should it tremble be-
fore the might of the soph ferns,
the so-called weaker sex.

Which team will gain the env-
eted three points in rivalry?
Come to the game today at 4:15
in front of Page Hall and learn
the answer to this burning
question.

 

Neimen to Play
Cortland Today;
Lose RPl Match

With the records showing one win
and one loss, the State netmen
have spent the past week practicing
for their match with Cortland Nor-
mal this afternoon. The match is
scheduled to take place on State‘s
home courts at Ridgeﬁeld, starting
at 2:30. Captain Brauner feels con-
fident of State’s chances of winning,
for last year‘s i‘acqueteers defeated
Cortland handily by a score of 6-3.
Lose to RPI

After breezing through to an easy
win over Plattsburg in the season’s
opening match, the squad took a ra-
ther bad heating from the flashing
racquets of RPI last week. The
match was played on RPI's home
courts. The score was 6-2.

The players who won Were Mullin,
playing in third spot, who won his
singles match, and Finer and Mul-
lin in their doubles match. The
hardest fought set of the day, go-
ing to 28 games before it was de-
cided, was between Stiller and his
man. Stiller ﬁnally lost 13-15.
Schultze Replaces Steinberg

The only man who was successful
in replacing a team man was L.
Walter Schultze, who defeated
Steinberg at Ridgeﬂeld on Sunday.

Since no more challenge matches
can be played, the squad has been
finally set. It consists of Harry
Kensky, Henry Brauner, Fran Mul-
lin, Norman Finer, Bernard Bern-

hardt, Alfred Stiller, and L. Walter

Golden Horde Leads Red Raiders
As Final Week of Rivalry Nears

by Clarence Oarr
With only one week remaining, in-
terest in the traditional trash-soph
battle is keyed to a high pitch. At
present, the tradition-breaking cla5s
of '44 is well in the lead of the
Crimson and White “Torrent” (so-
called). If the contests which have
so far been staged, the Golden
Horde has garnered 15‘/.- points, the
frosh, Slit. However, there are 18
more points to be decided, so the
frosh may be considered as having
a slim chance.
The Rivalry points to date are:

3U.- 15%

The ﬁrst of these events, the wo-
men’s softball game, will take place
this afternoon in front of Page Hail.
Mary Domann, ’44, and Nora Gia-
velli, '45, are the representative cap-
tains of their teams. The Men’s
softball contest will take place
Tuesday, May 5, at 4:30 P.M., under
the captainshlps of Hal Ashworth,

GEORGE D. JEONEY. PROP.

 

 

i
’44, and Buck Hippick, '45.

The tug-of-war, captained by Ray
Verrey, ’44, and Zollle Privett, ’45,
will occur at 12 noon, May 8. At
4:30 the same day the pushball con-
test will be held under captains Bill
Marsland, '44, and Don Sayles, 45,
followed by the women's field events
at 4250.

Naturally, both classes have very
partisan points of view, each main-
taining that the other will be
slaughtered. However, that is a
point that but one thing can settle
—time.

The remaining points are:

Girls Boys Both

Softball ................ .. 3
Tug-of-War  2
Pushball 2
Stunts  3
Sing ..................... .. 3
Women’s races  2

Looking at the frosh record so far,
there seems to be nothing much that
serves to back up their rash state-
ments other than a determined
fighting Spirit. Last fall’s pushball
and football games were easily won
by the sophs.

And another thing to consider is
the spirit evidenced in the soph
theme song—“We did it before, and
we can do it again!"

'Pirates' Operetta

To be Televised

From Schenectady

Abridged Cast to Act
Within 40-Foot Front

State College strikes out into a
new ﬁeld May 16 at 8:00 P. M. when
the Operatic Society's presentation
of Gilbert and Sullivan’s Pirates of

Peiizance is televised from WGEA,
Schenectady. An abridged cast will
try out the new medium in response
to an invitation extended last Mon-
day by the Television Station in
Schenectady.

A director from the studio has
been engaged to instruct the players
in the art of acting for a television
audience, since there are many tech-
nical aspects involved in a televised
production. The cast has to prac-
tice moving in a space of 400 square
feet, and all movement must be to
left and right to keep the characters
in focus. The production is an ex-
perimental one for State, since the
group is pioneering for the college
in this ﬁeld. Visitors are admitted
free of charge to the studio.

To conserve space, the cast has
been considerably cut down. A chorus
of ten men and ten women will
appear in the television production.
Max Reeves, '42, and Jean McAl-
lister, '43, head the cast. Other
principals are George Kunz, Harley
Dingman, Betty Marston, Juniors,
Eleanor Schlesinger, Brooks Roberts,
Seniors, and Jane Southwick, Ger-
trude Bove, and Verne Marshall,
Sophomores.

Budget Adopted;
Annual is Planned

The 1942-43 budget was passed at
the Student Association meeting
last Friday after being submitted
to a number of changes at two
student association meetings de-
voted to discussion of the budget.

The most controversial proposal
adopted was one to eliminate the
Statesman. The motion was carried
by a vote of 345-240.

But the literary efforts of State
College could not be dampened so
easily for the Statesman was re-
vived in another form at the May 1.
meeting when Edwin Holstein, '42,
moved that $300 be appropriated for
the publication of u college literary
annual. There was little objection
to this motion and it was piissed
with an amendment providing that
elections for the Board of the mug—
uzine be held annually at an open
public meeting and also that all
materials belonging to the States-
mmi be turned over to the new or-
giiiiization.

Myskania Goes

by Janet Baxter

Maybe they haven’t done it be-
fore but Myskania has done it this
year. By this, We mean that the
1941-42 Myskania has really accom-
plished some definite objectives. Be-
sides the routine tasks they have
handled, they have an impressive
list of accomplishments to their
credit.

Firstly, Myskania was the lin-
pelling force behind the Student-
Faculty Discussion Group until war
activities stole the limelight.

It was Myskania which promoted
the Student Union idea and the
utilization of the Farrell Mansion.
And it was Myskania that conducted
the cafeteria investigation.

Throughout this semester, Mys-

Places in '42

kania has met many times with Dr
Sayles to discuss student problems.
Administration and faculty alike
have praised its work in establish-
ing better relations and cooperation

between students and faculty.

To top this stellar record, the lead-
ing group of the campus dofi’ed their
caps and stored away their black
robes in favor of sweat shirts and
shorts for the Myskania-Faculty
basketball game. The rough and
ready contest netted $110 for the
Red Cross and the War Activities

Council.

So it is to this brilliant career that
Myskania writes ﬂnls when they tap
their successors tomorrow. They've
“started something,” so, new Mys-
kania, what’re ya gonna do about it?

Stale Orchestra, Students Select Staff for Annual-

Choral Society
Concert Success

by Mary Studebaker

Last night, to a small but respon-
sive audience. State College Choral
Society, Operatic Society, and Sym-
phony Orchestra presented an ex—
tremely ambitious and highly suc-
cessful program concert. The serious
regret of the evening. and it is a
deep one, was the small attendance.

The Symphony Orchestra climbed
steadily from s high—schoolish pre-
sentation of the Toreador Aria to u
it brilliant interpretation of Encsco’s
Rimmuimi Rhapsody. Although the
rendition of the Hiiydn Symphony
was adequate, it wus in Profkol‘flev's
Triumphul March and Moussorg-
sky's Grout (late of Kim Unit the
orchestra reached its full stride.
'l‘he Bach Fugue showed the or-
chestra's increased maturity in
technique and emotion.

The Choral Society presented
their port of the program with
delightful wurmtli and sincerity.
Especially stirring Were the two
Iiiitiii selections in the lfith Cen-
tury group, the ever-popular Wit/(r:
’I'Iu'c Now, [Juan's-I and the bcuuti-
in] English folk song" May Dill]
Carol were exceedingly well done.
it was the refreshing Negro spir-
itqu Ho‘s 1 Can Write My Name,
sung with all flip gusto of it. revival
meeting, that completely won the
uudlencc, lichvcr.

’I'ltc l’irulcs of PUNIJUIUU made u
huppy return in the presentation of
some of its scores by the Operatic
Society. Needless to say, the selec-
tions were boiled with the some
degree of enthusiasm that they re-
cuivcil iii their debut. ’l‘hut “The
Very Model of a Modern Major
General," George Kunz once again
wulked away with the audience's
heart in his solo. McAllistcr and
Hooves were its professional as
usual, and l-iurlcy Dlng'mun once

again “cousinbuliiried" successfully,
although it is to be regretted that
Mr. Dingmon could not complain
about his policemiin‘s lot. The fi-
nules of not one and not two gave
the entire Choral Society on oppor-
tunity to show its talents to the
full.

With an attendance of about fifty
students, the staff for the new liter-
ary annual was chosen by popular
vote. This annual will replace the
present magazine, the Statesman.
The relatively large number of peo-
ple who attended the meeting shows
that a vital interest is being taken
in the annual by the student body.

Kay Martin, ’43, was named
Editor-in-chief by a large majority:
Shirley Jennings, ’43, as literary edi-
tor, will consider the material sub-
mitted by staff members. Emma
Baccari, ’43, was unanimously
elected Business Manager, and Mari—
lyn Rich, '43, was chosen Art Editor.
All of these positions are and must
be filled by incoming Seniors, uc-
cording to the plan drawn up by
members of the Statesman staff
under Mary Klein.

Betty Barden and Janet Wood
were named Senior Literary staff
members; the four Junior stuff
members for the coming year in-
clude Rhona Ryan, Mary Stude-
baker, Robert Loucks. and Eunice
Baird. The six staff members, chosen

from the incoming Sophomore class.
are Harold Geldsteln, Ruth Fine,

Muriel Feldiniin, Roselyn Slote,
Barbara Putnam, and Margaret
Dee.

As yet no name has been chosen
for the publication which will appear
once a year in the spring. No policies
have been named, except that the
whole staff will be divided into an
Executive Board.
