Ours Not to‘Rcason Why . . .

The “masthead” which appears above this
editorial will never be reproduced again, for
tomorrow in assembly new hands, new minds,
and new energy will be chosen to produce the
STATE COLLEGE NEWS. That is as it has
always been. Tomorrow in assembly many
other new people will assume all the guiding
roles in this institution. That, too, is as it
has always been. Tomorrow in assembly the
Senior Class will go into mourning for itself
and will ﬁnally pass away on Commencement
Day. Nothing in this is unusual either. The
situation that is different, the innovation on
the scene is that the words “safe now in the
wide, wide world” belie the actual circum-
stances. The Seniors are not safe.

For the ﬁrst time in 24 years a Senior
Class walks forth from this campus into the
jaws of death. For the ﬁrst time in 24 years,
no member of the Senior Class will be allowed
to go on with his or her normal plans for life.
The class of 1942 strides out into a world that
is ﬁlled with fear, destruction, privation, and
decadence of all sorts. It strides into a world
that needs its leadership and its manhood
badly, because the very premise upon which
its education has been based is in danger of
being crushed by a most formidable foe. Do
not take your situation lightly, Class of 1942,
for you are in a nasty spotII But do not let
your situation get you down, for you have
within you the desire and the means for
ridding yourself of the pestilence that plagues
you. Accept your lot as it is cast upon you.
Adjust yourself to it and bend every effort
to make it a better one. Only by such a
philosophy will you be able to live now and
after the Victory without warping your
mind beyond repair.

The task of the men is clear. They must
defend, with their blood if need be, the home
that is ours. If possible, they must train
themselves to lead in the armed forces, for
there lies the greatest need for college men
in the service. Others will find that the tech-
nical skills which they have acquired are of
value. They must exert these skills to the
utmost, to produce for war.

Women have a different sort of war task.
They must continue their chosen 1')rof'cssion
of teaching, but they must teach the prin-
ciples of Internationalisrn in a new and inten-
siﬁed light. They must indoctrinatc a code
of life for the world which is to follow and
that world will he a radically diil’ercz‘lt one.
It will require new ideas for its inhabitants
and these ideas can come only from liberal,
farsceing teachers.

These are your tasks, Class of 1942. Spe-
ciﬁcally stated for the men, ambiguoust
stated for the women. A large and difficult
task and a chance to see a new world in the
making are a privilege that is given to but

few. Accept this privilege, Class of 1942.
Do your job well, so that State College will
be proud to have borne you. Good luck to
us ailll

 

 

STATE COLLEGE NEWS, FRIDAY, MAY 0, 1942

Exam Schedule—SECOND SEMESTER

Exclusive to the STATE COLLEGE NEWS

The Office of the Dean has released the Examination Sched—
ule for the second semester of the college year. The exams will
begin on Thursday, May 21, and continue through Wednesday,
May 27. As in the ﬁrst semester, the exam periods will last
for only two hours, regardless of the number of credit hours.
Each day will be divided into three exam periods.

(Ed. Note: This schedule was complete and accurate at press time for
the Shire COLLEGE News. For possible changes in time and/or room. of

examinations consult the official bulletin board in Draper Hall. Assimi-
mcnts for conflict exams will be posted on the various bulletin boards

By' Herb Lcnckcr

John L. Lewis wants to protect the farmers, and
the farmers want to be protected from John L.—but
to the cows (the real producers), contentcdly chew-
ing their ends, it’s just a lot of bull. . . .

ADDED CRITICISM—In the library, where a pre-
mium is placed upon quietness, someone would do well
to apply some axle-grease to the wheels of the push
book-cart. The rattle of this cart, as it frequently
makes its rounds, is far more annoying than the
whispering which is so strenuously frowned upon. . . .

Vocal Boy Makes Good

Moe Stevens, good looking red head of the class of
’41, spent last weekend here at State, visiting his old
haunts. . . .

Moe was inducted last July at Fort Bragg, N. 0..
where he "enjoyed" the basic training plus specialists
work in instruments at the Field Artillery Replace-
ment Center. After his basic training, “red-dog” was
transferred to the 28th Field Artillery Battalion at
Fort Jackson, South Carolina—a 155 millimeter How—
itzer outfit—where he took part in a month of
maneuvers.

Moe describes the maneuvers adequately with a
laconic, but eloquent “Ugh!”

Following Pearl Harbor, Stevens started working
toward Officers School and the Air Corps. Naturally,
he was accepted for both, but chose the Air Corps,
"Because it offered more action.”

Virtue does not go long unrewardcd, and Moe is no
exception. Our Hero is now addressed as Technical
Sergeant Stevens, whose job is, in his own words,
“trying to fool the Colonel into thinking I'm a smart
guy."

Sergeant Stevens is having an extended vacation
due to the fact that training facilities in the Air
Corps are overcrowded at present. Sergeant Red per—
suaded his superior officers that the Army would be
better off if he got out of the way till the situation
cleared up a bit—and both he and the Army would
enjoy a rest. . . .

Moe has advanced commendany in the armed forces.
and gives his formula for any who might be interested
—or drafted—“You can get anything you want in the
Army with some brains and lots of hard work and
ambition.”

ADDED lltONY—The canes to be wielded by the
Juniors moving-up day were made in Japan! How-
ever, Ira Hirsch, purchasing agent for '43, explains
that the canes were in stock long before the war broke
out, since it has been impossible to import bamboo
after Hirohito’s henchmen snuck in the rabbit punch
on December 7.

This is an ironical situation, but should in no way
interfere with the use of the props which will hold
up many weary juniors throughout the day . . .
especially those who might be feeling the innnodcratc
adoption of a liquid diet. . . .

Any possible clamour against the use of the canes
would be prompted, in our opinion, by petty or sordid
reasons, and should be ignored as such.

All we have to do is follow Pete Marchetta's logic
that the canes were made in China and conﬁscated by
the sons of nippons. . . . However. anyone with any
qualms can ease their conscience by buying a war
stamp——and thus help keep someone marching who
hasn’t got a cane to support himself with. . . .

BEST SPEECH OF THE WEEK was Dr. Hartley's
after dinner job at the Junior Banquet, where he
stuck a hypodermic into some old jokes and put them
across in his own subtle way.

Dr. Hartley spoke on how to keep sane during war
times, prescribing that all students keep busy, develop
new interests, and do thoroughly the job at hand.
“Don’t live for the day, but live fully each day.”

So chalk one up for the jolly prof. of the attitude
building dep't. . . .

Bulger Reports
Increase in Calls;

Commerce Leads

142 SEB Placements
Correspondineg Lower

“There have been more calls for
teachers this year than in past
years, but there has not been a cor—
responding increase ln the number
of placements,” said Mr. Paul Bul-
ger, director of the Student Employ—
ment Bureau. “Most of the calls We
have received have been for women,"
commented Mr. Bulger, “but princi-
pals still want to employ men teach-
ers, if they are good enough. In line
with this, there is a slight shortage
of teachers due especially to the
drafting of men teachers, and to the
fact that defense industries are of-
fering such high wages.”

57 ltcccivc Appointments

Approximately 57 seniors, out of a
class of about 260, have received
teaching appointments, and of these,
56 were women. Mauritz Johnson
from Westford is the only male in
the class of ’42 to obtain a teaching
position. He will teach Science and
Mathematics in Bombay.

Out of 142 placements which the
SEB made or assisted in making this
year, Commerce was by for the most
popular subject, receiving 33 calls.
English was next in popularity With

13 calls, the Math—Science combina-
tion running a close third with 10
placements. Nine social studies stu-
dents were placed by the Bureau.
chcn students obtainch library-
English placements. The old stand~
bys such as Mathematics, Science,
French and English—Social Studies
have received only 3, 2, 1, and 1 calls
respectively so far.

Notify of Summer Address

Seniors should notify the SEB of-
licc of their summer addresses and
sunnncr telephone numbers, and of
any changes in their permanent ad-
dresses. ll seniors receive any sort
of employment or if they no longer
desire teaching positions, they
should notify SEB, so the records
can be kept straight. .

New placements are as follows:
Marion Kurlansik, '39, Millerton,
Commerce; Elizabeth Baker, ‘39,
Billinorc, L. l., Commerce; Marga—
ret Clapp, ’42, ll'lcischmanns, French-

RAIL-AIR IIRVICI

by Janet Baxter

Many and varied are the thoughts
that cross the human mind as the
college year approaches its height.
Now only short hours intervene be-
fore the student body will know
ALL. Tomorrow the poll of secrecy
will lift from State's ivied walls, and
everyone can draw a deep breath
without looking around to see if he
is being observed.

Let’s join the roving reporter and
find out some individual reactions
on the big show. Bob Leonard, '43,
commented: “I’ve got to make a
speech, so right now I think it’s
lousy." Mary “Abby” Domann, ’44,
said: “At last my curiosity will be
satisﬁed. It’s the high spot of the
year. Incidentally, our blouses
$!%-**cl”

“Moving—Up Day is elevating,"
was Don Vanas’. ’42, cryptic remark.
Short and snappy too was Ruth Leg-
gett.'s, ’43, comment: "Curiosity and
tension,” and “Moose” Gerber, ’43,
said: "It'll be interesting." “My, but
I’m excited—for my friends,” hu-
mor-izcd Helen Bruckcr, ’44.

Speaking as one who is about to
experience his ﬁrst Moving—Up Day,
Joe Rouller. ‘45, said, “It’ll be a
diversion after all these months of
cramming." And on the other side
of the ledger is this comment from

a Senior, Glen Walrath, who looks
to his last Moving-Up. Oddly enough,
one thought fills Glen's mind: "It’s
that damn Ivy speech I have to
give. Of course I feel a little senti-
mental, considering that I’ll prob-
ably be in the war next year, but,
hell, that speech!"

Saul Stolbof, ’44, recalled the
events of last year when he said
“I hope that our class speaker will
mount the stage with hair all there."
Shirley Kyle, '42, says “My first
thought is: wear comfortable shoes.
I speak from three years of bitter
experience. You enjoy the day most
as a Junior; it seems like an anti-
climax to a Senior. It makes you
feel sad to see all the young sprouts
coming up to ﬁll your shoes—for
the Seniors are moving out.”

Marilyn Rich, ’43, says: “I look
forward to Moving-Up Day as a
time of fun. My thoughts don't go
any deeper. I appreciate it more as
a freshman and sophomore, but now
it doesn’t mean so much."

“I am thoroughly bored with the
whole procedure," concisely stated
Harry Passow, '42. (Note: Harry is
one of THOSE people who already
know ALL.)

So there we have a cross-section
of the thoughts State College is
thinking the day before THE BIG
DAY.

ments for the Ball, Nicholas Mor-
sillo is band chairman, Delores Gal-
onian will handle the bids, and
