’Royal Family’ is Satire
On Barrymore Family

A satire on the illustrious Barry-
more Family takes the spotlight May
15, when The Royal Family makes
its appearance at State for the sec-
ond time in eight years. The play,
written by Kaufman and Ferber,
will be presented by the Advanced
Dramatics class at 8:30 P. M. in the
Page Hall auditorium. Miss Agnes
Futterer, Assistant Professor of
English, is directing.

The play concerns a family of
actors whose lives have been bound
by traditions of the theater. It is
an attempt to display the difference
between two generations: the older,
as represented by the charming
elderly “trouper,” Fanny Cavendish,
who is determined never to cease
acting. while the younger genreation,
portrayed by Julie and Gwen Caven-
dish, rebel and temporarily relin-
quish acting, but ultimately return
to the stage through their innate
love of the theater.

The cast is as follows: Fanny
Cavendish, Betty Barden, ’43; Julie
Cavendish, Jane Curtis, ’43; Tony
Cavendish, James McFeeley, ’44;
Gwen Cavendish, Trece Aney, '44;
Herbert Dean, Jack Vose, ’44; Kitty
LeMoyne, Kathleen Martin, ’43;
Perry Stewart, Harold Ashworth,
’44; Oscar Wolfe, Morris Gerber, ’43;
Della, Janet Wood, '43; J0, Milton
Adams, '44; Gil Marshall, George
Seifert, ’42; McDermott, John Lubey,

June Melville, ’43, was slated for
the part of Gwen, but due to an
appendicitis attack, was unable to
continue the performance. Trece
Aney has taken over her role. John
Lubey has also substituted for Luke
Zilles, '43, who was called for the
draft.

Corner Ontario at Benson St.

ganization in State College will end
its ﬁrst semester’s work today. The
sewing room was furnished and be-
gan to function January 26. During
the thirteen weeks following this
date, the college girls made various
articles including rompers, several
different styles of skirts, snowsuits,
dresses, convalescent robes, boys’
pants and nightgowns.

Sally Beard, '42, chairman of Red
Cross sewing at State, feels that the
organization “really accomplished a
lot." Those girls who sewed enjoyed
the variety and the recess from
studying.

Activity in the sewing room was
supervised by faculty members. Mrs.
Tiezen organized the group and
spent two days a week sewing with
the girls. Other faculty members and
faculty wives who aided greatly were
Mrs. Barsam, Mrs. Brimmer, Mrs.
Cooper, Miss Dobbin, Miss Lester,
Mrs. Sisk and Miss Stokes.

An average of thirty girls worked
fifty-two hours per Week during the
semester. Madeleine Fagan, the most
faithful sewer; worked ﬁve hours
every week. Girls who missed no

Dust Off Old Magazines;
Keep Soldiers Up-to-Date

The Faculty has done it
again!

This time, the Faculty has
contributed magazines for the
enjoyment of those soldiers sta-
tioned at Albany; and the mag-
azines have been so numerous
and of such good quality, that
Dr. Robert Rienow wishes pub-
licly to thank the Faculty for
their contributions.

There are many soldiers sta-
tioned in the vicinity of Albany
with lots of time on their hands.
Nothing would suit them better
than reading about the theatre
in the New Yorker or looking at
the pictures in Esquire.
