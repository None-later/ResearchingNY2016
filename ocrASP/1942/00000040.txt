CARL MITCHELL

The old order changelh, yielding

place to the new. . . .
lily"! of the King, Tennyson

Amid nostalgic reminiscences, your
sports editor sits down and pens his
last column.

But we've achieved at least one
ambition. State College can now
boast at long last, a FIGHT SONG!
After our brief campaign to ﬁnd
someone in school who would write
such a song had exhausted itself;
and we had given up all hope, up
pop two enterprising seniors with
the goods.

The sports department takes its
wig off to these lads and heartily
extends a congratulatory ﬁst full
of digits. We‘re behind them 100%
and we’re sure their names will live
with the song at every sports con-
test to comei
Keep It Clean

But there's one more ambition
that we'd like to see fulﬁlled. And
that’s an absolute minimum in fra—
ternity sacriﬁces under the guise of
sports.

In the few vears we’ve been here
we were more than a little disturbed
to ﬁnd that the impetus to excel in
sports has not been pure love of
athletics, but a sprinkling of adulter-
ated politics to the greater glory of
the fraternity!

This year we've made every pos-
sible attempt (and quite success-
fully) to keep fraternity politics and
loyalty out of the sports page. The
sports page is a vital element in
giving proper recognition to out-
standing athletic events. To date.
sports reporting has been kept clean
-—and we sincerely hope that par-
ticipation in sports will be on the
same basis.

On To Victory

And now one final tribute to those
young fellows who will soon put
away their books and pick up the
sword.

We wonder if all appreciate the
fact that there are many among us
who will be in the armed forces
within a few weeks.

However, despite this. not one
single objection has been voiced in
protest. Not one lad has sought
sympathy. Instead there is a will
to go on and perform the duty which
is so necessary at this time. To
those who remain behind the full
signiﬁcance of this situation is as
yet unrecognized. Not until the
casualty lists come back with the
names of close ones will they realize
what is really taking place
perhaps. not until there is another
plaque in the Rotunda . . . Dulce

Two Seniors Write Words, Music
OI Long-Awaited State Fight Song

by Ray Vcrrcy

The sport department is happy to
ﬁnd that after a prolonged cam-
paign to get some of the local talent
to write a ﬁght song for the sports
contestants, this ambition has been
ﬁnally consummated.

Les Graves. '42. trumpet teacher
at Vincentlan Institute and a mem-
ber of the State College Orchestra.
reccntly wrote a melody for the
piano and made several arrange-
ments for different instruments
which now constitutes the official
State College Fight Song. “We Can
Win."

Words to accompany the song
were written by Edwin J. Holstein.
vcrsatilc editor of the Nuws.

The melody is printed above with
the following words:

“He l‘ltll will. If \vn light.
If \u- roully NIHIW our Inlulll
\h- min plmil Ilmi scori- nkr IIIKII-
town on .Vi-ll, they run lull.
'I‘Iiui \W'll giu- tin-m merry hull.
For old Hlnio bus the will to defy.
We will give oil in» Tune.
.\ml no effort in lo grout,
For our ivum Inn» llu- strength to sin).
The Purple uml IIII' tlold lights to
\Ii'lory
.\ml in» urn ullll ihmn nll III-u why!"

The words and melody will be
sung by the Student Association this
morning when tin.- song is introduced
by Presidcnt John Ralph Tibbctis.

[hiring today's slug Shirley Moslici'
will play the piano arrangement,
while i‘lnrl Snow will load the slug-
ing,

However. the song which will be pre-
sented to the student association to-
day compares favorably with any
one written.

The fact that the song was writ-
ten by two men in actual attendance
at this college is probably more bcnc—
llclal than having one who is far
removed from local needs compose
such a song.

Baseball Lead
Goes to Potter

Potter Club took over ﬁrst place
in the intramural softball league
Wednesday when Kappa Beta de-
feated the former leaders, Sigma
Lambda, by an 8 to 4 score. Max
Reeves. pitching for SLS. yielded
only six hits but errors at crucial
moments allowed the winning runs
to score.

Meanwhile, Potter Club won its
games with Ramblers and KDR by
scores of 15-8 and 15-4 respectively
running its win skein to four. KB,
Ramblers and SLS are tied for sec-
ond place with three wins and one

Clay Sprowls pitched a 110-bit

attempt for a shut-out was spoiled
when two errors and a walk allowed
two unearned runs to score in the
ﬁnal inning.

Pitcher George Seifert smashed
two home runs Wednesday to lead
Sayles Hall to victory over College
House. The game was called at the
end of the rlfth inning because of
rain. The score stood at 11-8.

Thomas More lost two more
games. The ﬁrst went to Kappa Beta

KDR by a 14 to 11 tally.

State Gollers Lose to Siena

In their ﬁrst attempt in inter-
collegiate competition, the newly 0r-
ganized golf team wound up on the
losing end of a 11-4 score. The State
golfers ran up against a well experi-
enced Siena squad and only Bitt-
man and Sussina were able to garner
points for the locals. The State rep-
resentatives in the order in which
they played are: Bert Kiley. Howard
Lynch. Dave Griffin, Dave Blttman.
and John Sussina.

 

 

GINN Y POLHEMUS

In line with all the announcing
of honors tomorrow during the tra-
ditional M-U-D ceremonies. let me
say today that praise should go to
Kay Peterson for a swellegant job
this year as prez of WAA. With
enthusiastic leadership, she has pre-
sented an expanded program which
has resulted in an increased num-
ber of girls turning out for the
various sports.

Bowling to the Fore

One activity which has spurted
into the limelight during the past
year is bowling. Seventy girls bowled
twelve or more times to receive
credit, and a countless number didn’t
quite make the credit. A bowling
league of seven teams was organized
and the tournament was completed
with alacrity. All of the participants
regretted seeing the contests end.
What more can be said?

Fencing. too, has received more
attention. A big factor responsible
this year was the introduction of
Saturday morning instructions by
an expert. The exhibition given by
the girls showed the excellent results
of their practice.

These are but two sports—how-
ever, ask any active WAA’er about
this year’s swell program.

Posters Please

The value of publicity cannot be
denied—the eye-arresting posters
which have decorated the WAA
bulletin board this year have played
a great part in reminding the mem-
bers about each activity.

TIME MARCHES ON DEPT.—
Tomorrow we seniors will relinquish
our places to the juniors selected as
our successors. Naturally, we shall
do it reluctantly. but with conﬁ-
dence that they will probably do a
better job than we have.

So long, seniors—see you at the
Alumni affairs.

VanasTriumphsbyéTVotes Slavinl To Edit
In Association Presidency

Ashworth, Roulicr Take
Maior Election Berth:

Staving off a last minute chal-
lenge by a surprisingly strong can-
didate. Don Vanas was elected to
the presidency of Student Associa-
tion for next year to succeed Ralph
Tibbetts. The announcement of
Vanas’ election to the highest under-
graduate office in the college was
greeted by a tumult of cheers from
a Moving-Up-Day gathering which
included students, parents, and fac-
ulty.

In winning the crowning laurels
of a long and popular political ca-
reer, Vanas defeated Howard Lynch
by a vote of 343 to 276. a majority
of 67. Lynch entered the contest
against the vice-president of Student
Association an under-dog. having
never held a major popularly-elected
office in the college; he emerged
with a strong following.

Climax of Vanas’ Career

For Vanas it was the climax of a
successful political career which be-
gan at the end of his freshman year
with his election to secretaryship of
Student Association. Since then he
has climbed almost with ease the
traditional ladder to the top. He
won the vice-presidency last year
by a 2 to 1 vote and until Lynch’s
strong bid this year he appeared to
be an invincible candidate for the
presidency.

The hotly contested race drew 619
undergraduates to the polls to vote
for their choice for president.

The other two major elections for
Student Association office were not
nearly so clear cut. Two males de-
feated opposition which included
women to round out the masculine
trio which will run the Student
Association next year. Harold Ash-
worth was elected vice-president and
Joe Rouller, secretary.

Women’s Bloc Split

Ashworth trailed Pat Latimer in
the ﬁrst vote for the vice-presi-
dency, but in the revotes Ashworth
gathered enough strength to defeat
Miss Latimer by a margin of 63
votes. The defeat of Miss Latimer
indicated cracking of the women's
bloc which helped sweep her into
the secretaryshlp last year. The only
other candidate of any strength was
Fred Shoemaker. Rhona Ryan made
a fair showing, while Fred Beyer and
Pat Carroll never had a chance.
The last minute write-in ballot
movement for Miss Carroll was be-
gun too late to have any effect on
the election.
ltoullcr Surprises

In the race for secretary. Joe Rou-
licr made a surprising showing. In
the original vote, he ran third to
Peggy Dee and Fran Mullin. In the
ﬁrst revotes he succeeded in elimi-
nating Miss Dee. despite his drawing
of only 8 more votes than she. In
the ﬁnal revotes he defeated Fran
Mullin by‘ 5 votes. The only other
candidates of any consequence were
Elaine Harris and Martha Sprcnger.
both of whom had only about a half
dozen votes less than Roulicr in the
first vote. but Were nevertheless
eliminated.

Competition was fairly keen in
other student association elections.
three votes being ilccessury to decide
the NSFA rcprcsmitativc for next
year. William Mnrsland, even though
the post had been abolished before
the third voting.

The Forum of Politics has ap-
pointed the following to its Board
for the coming year: Speaker.
Shirley Wurz. '43; Clerk. Rhona

Feency,‘ Garlall,
Young Elected

In the Class of 1943 with 143 peo-
ple marking ballots, Thomas Feeney
rode into the presidency with a
decisive plurality of 83 votes. Mildred
Mattice was uncontested for the po—
sition of vice-president of this class.
Oddly enough exactly 143 members
of the Class of 1942 also participated
in their spring elections last year.

Richmond Young gained the presi-
dency of the Class of 1944 via the
slightly more difficult revote route.
With 154 ballots cast in the
ﬁrst vote and 134 in the second vote.
Young nosed cut Sovik by a scant
seven vote margin. Young is a new-
comer on the presidential roster as
is his vice-presidential running
mate, Fred Shoemaker. who won
with a more decisive plurality of 31
votes.

The incoming sophomores. 170
strong, voted conﬁdence in the pres-
ent administration of the Class of
1945 by reinstating both Florence
Garfall as president and Curtis
Pfaff as vice—president. Garfall
came through with a plurality of 31
votes in the ﬁrst effort on the bal-
cony of the Commons, while it took
Pfaff a revote to draw out of a six-
candidate ﬁeld with an identical
plurality.

The complete listing of the new
class officers is as follows:

Class of 1942.: Class Poet, Mary
Klein; Class Prophet, Loretta Ser-
vatius; Class Historian, Jeannette

seemed that all was over as Paul Merritt left his place, walked '
across the stage and returned to his position. A murmur rose
from the assemblage, however, as Jeanette Ryerson stepped
out to make another journey to return with Lois Haﬂey. Once
again, _the crowd sat back, only to be roused again as Edwin
Holstein left the stage to “tap” Winifred Jones, thus complet-
ing the maximum number that could be selected. Passow’s
final tour signifying the formal ending of the tapping cere-

mony came as an anti-climax.

Old-New Myskania Speak

Opcning this morning’s program
were speakers from each of the four
classes. Junior class speaker was
Robert Leonard. tenth man to be
tapped for Myskania this morning.
Speaking for the class of 1942 was
William Dickson. a member of the
outgoing Myskania. Barbara Put—
nam and Betty Gravello also spoke.

It is coincidental that only once
in recent years has a. thirteen mem-
bered Myskania been selected and
this Myskania presided during the
freshman year of the outgoing Mys-
kania. Coincidental also, is the fact
that the 1938—1939 Myskania also
consisted of seven men and six wo-
men just as does the Myskania
selected today.

A. Harry Passow opined the cere-
monies with a slow delberate jour-
ney. escorting back to .he stage the
newly elected MAA president. Owen
Bombard. director of freshman
camp. Paul Merritt followed. sur-
prising the assemblage and convinc-
ing them that the “office to oﬂice”
and “brother to brother" procedure
had been deliberatley neglected once
again. Merritt named Howard,
Lynch, defeated candidate for the
presidency of student association.
William Dickson then chose as his
successor Thomas Feeney. three-
year class president and captain of
basketball.

Ryerson Taps First Woman

Jeanette Ryerson was the ﬁrst
woman to leave the stage and the
ﬁrst to return having chosen -a
woman—Junior Prom Queen Mil-
dred Matticeuvice-president of her
class and member of Music Council.
Kathryn Wilson followed Miss
Ryerson’s lead and will be succeeded
by the NEW’S Muriel Scovell. The
NEWS then contributed its second
member to the campus leadership
society as William Dorrance returned
to the stage wrth the newly elected
editor-in-chief. David Slavin. Kath-
