 

Due to circumstances over 
theyrha‘d— no control, many colleges

in, the country Were forced to drop

intercollegiate baseball from their
sports program. state was among
the schools who put their bats and
balls in storage. The situation was
regrettable but there was no alter-
native.» . '

m- viewing the college baseball
situation, We can well understand
the lasing. ﬁght that the sport is
facing today. The war situation
has created conditions which made
in some places the maintenance
of the diamond sport an impossi-
bility.

war Effects

most without exception every
college has abbreviated its semes-
ters and consequently shortened the
already short college baseball sea-
son. Traveling difficulties, with
emphasis on the shortage of rubber
and rationing of gasoline offers an-
other obstacle to collegiate baseball.

With the exception of New York
City. colleges are not located within
close range of each other and trans-
portation is a very important ele-
ment in their schedule.

The past few years have found
baseball steadily decreasing in pop-
ularity as a college sport. The ath-
letic moguls who direct the college
sport program have for years eyed
baseball reluctantly because it was
not a paying proposition. The dia-
mond sport does not compare with
their million-dollar football busi-
ness; nor does it approach their
Madison Square Garden proﬁts of
the winter. Instead it cuts a large
hole in their sports budget.

Doubtful Future

The present war situation struck
a staggering blow to collegiate base-
ball. a blow from which it may not
recover for some time. After De-
mocracy has conquered and the war
will have been won. baseball will
ﬁnd it very difficult to re-enter the
college sport curriculum. Interests,
other than sports. will oppose base-
ball for the various colleges. Unless
a method is found whereby the
great American game can become
a business-like. professionalized.
money making proposition, its fu-
ture as a major college sport is
very doubtful.

50phs Overcome
Frosh in Rivalry

The ﬁnal curtain has fallen on
the frosh—soph rivalry for this year
with the class of '44 emerging as
the winner for the second consecu-
tive year. Overcoming their adver-
saries in a much harder manner
than is exhibited in the final tabu~
latlon. the Golden Horde came in
on the long end of a amt-(ii;-
score.

With 18 points still left to go. the
freshman women. under Nora Gia-
velli, come thru with a 17-11 win
over the sophomore softball team.
The men of '44. however. avenged
this loss and put an end to fresh-
man hopes when they won the
men's softball game. garnering 14
runs to their opponents three.

The day before Moving-Up Day.
the sophs again sollied into the
fresh camp and came out victor-
ious. At noon. their Tug-oi-War
team outpulled the Crimson Tide in
two out of two attempts. At 3:30
that afternoon the soph women
struggled through the obstacle and
handicap races winning two out of
three and gaining the rivalry points.
As a finale they knocked down and
rolled over the fresh men to a 15-3
victory in pushball.

College Home Wins,-

Poiier Noses Out K

by Stan Gipp

The intramural softball schedule
suffered serious setbacks this week
due to rain, darkness. and a tie
game. Of the eight scheduled games
only three were officially completed.

As this report goes to press the
eight teams appear to be arranged
in the order they will ﬁnish except
for the possible interchange of Kap-
pa Beta and Sayles Hall after their
meeting in the near future.

The Ramblers. though not exactly
a dark horse aggregation, have
played better ball than expected.
Their position appears to be due
mainly to their hitting. and to the
pitching of Clay Sprowls.

SLS Takes Early Lead

SLS enjoyed early season domin-
ation but does not really possess
the power which would entitle them
to such a position. In Ashworth.
Guarino. and Griffin they have
three stellar performers but their
talent does not include many more.

Kappa Beta has the power but
lacks the pitching. The fact that
many of their players have been

pre-occupied with tennis must be
considered in their showing, and
with this in mind their play must
be commended.

‘ Sayles Hall has failed to live up
to its expectations, showing its pos-
sibilities very rarely. The defense
of this freshman team has sparkled
at times and glared at others.

KDit, with a lack of available
players. has also played spotty ball.
Its pitching has been its big weak-
ness. and Al Stone and Marsland its
main strength.

College House and Thomas More
have presented few players or plays
to rave about, but all representa-
tivm of these teams must be com-
mended for their spirit.

EEP Noses Out KB

The results of the games of last
week were all close and exciting.
Potter Club retained its lead by
virtue of its narrow 11-10 win over
KB. Bob Seifert walked '1 men in
the first inning and spotted KB a
10 run lead. Evans relieved him and
pitched masterful ball. Meanwhile
his teammates peeked away at the
10 run lead until Dickson climaxcd
the contest with a two run homer
to put Potter in the lead.

College House and Thomas More
battled to the SCilSL‘ll'S only tie.
ill-18. Monday night, being forced
to leave the outcome in balance be-
cause of darkness. in a repeat per-
formance. College House won a 26-
10 victory behind the hitting and
pitching of Oarr.

In another Well played. exciting
contest the Ramblers overcome a
7-1 lead to defeat Saych Hull ll-il.
Sprowis did not pitch the type of
ball that he did in his recent “no
hitter." but his timely hits told the
story.

Signum Leudis to Buy War Bond

Signlun [nudis will purchase a

of the association, announced. This
decision followed a meeting which

0hr memories are perhaps our
most precious possession. Yet we
cannot live in the past—we must
plan for the future. This has been
a good year for the feminine sport
fans of State College. WAA has
done a splendid job ‘—- yet it isn't
completed. There is much that can
and should be done by WAA’s new
officers next year.

We would like to see WAA em-
bark on a more intensive Inter-
house competitive program. There
is a keen spirit of rivalry here at
State among the sororities and
dorms. WAA can use this rivalry
to advantage by sponsoring various
leagues in which house teams may
compete.

Why doesn't WAA have the va-
rious houses on campus hold elim-
ination ping-pong tournaments.
thus choosing a houSe champion to
represent the house in an Inter-
house Ping-Pong Tourney?

The coming year offers a chal-
lenge to WAA—a challenge to pro-
vide many types of sports, an in-
creased number of Inter-house
leagues and more tournaments for
the women of State.

We might as well begin our so-
journ in this column in an atm05-
pherc of sweetness and light. tos-
sing bouquets hither and you, but
only where deserved. We give a
large one to Ginny Polhemus of
“Gin Mill” fame. Ginny contributed
many hours of her time and gained
a few gray hairs in endeavoring to
let the State College fans know
what went on in feminine sports.

We're well aware of the fact that
the words and opinions of a wo-
man's sports editor are not going to
sway the world or change the fate
of nations. But we will do our best
to keep you informed about life as
led by the lady athletes of State.

Hard luck in Weather conditions
has been riding the Statesmen's
shoulders for the past week. Both

past week were rained out. the ones

of time there will be no chance to

At the time of this writing.
State's record for this season is
slightly better than that for lost

ASK-tote Linksmen
Lose by Stroke

With high winds and driving
rains greatly hampering play, an
under-dog State College golf squad
came within an inch of upsetting
Siena’s touted linksmen in a return
match last Tuesday afternoon when
Bert Kiley, State’s number one man.
saw his 20-foot putt idle past the
rim of the cup on the water-soaked
18th green of the Albany Municipal
giolf Course. The ﬁnal score was

-'7.

Kiley, putting brilliantly on the
back nine, took the tenth, tying his
match with “Red” Flynn, moved
into the lead two holes later with a
birdie two, lost his advantage when
Flynn parted the 14th and birdied
the short 15th. re-tied the contest
on the'next hole with a par. and
then matched Siena’s top man
stroke for stroke the rest of the way
in a heavy downpour, splitting the
three match points.

In the earlier engagements, Dave
Griffin had little difficulty with Joe
Brennan. disposing of the Siena in-
coming senior class president. 5 out
of 4. and John Sussina nosed out
Syl Rahab. 2 and 1, after having
been held even for the ﬁrst nine.
Griffin garnered three match points
and Sussina two and one-half. Dave
Bittman and Howie Lynch ran afoul
of Pat Peartrce and Stan Kerbelis
and lost.

ASuccessiuI Year
With the college year coming to a‘
close, intramural council can look
back upon a very successful year.
They have sponsored intramural
football, basketball, bowling,
softball as major sports, and fea-
tured ping pong singles and doubles
tournaments. and a freshman ten-
nis tournament as minor sports.

They were able to welcome a new
member into their circuit, as Sayles
Hall. the new dorm, elected a mem-
ber in its ﬁrst year of existence.

The lion's share or the honors
were carried off by Potter Club as
they won the trophy in football, and
bowling, tied College House for ﬁrst
in basketball only to lose in the
play-off. and seem headed for al-
most certain honors in the softball
league.

This did not mean. however. that
there was a lack of interest dis-
played by the other members of the
council.

The council has announced the
individual representatives for 1942-
‘43 will be Ed Reed, for Potter
Club. Hal Singer, nominated by the
Ramblers, Hank Ruback, represent-
ing College House. Art Flax. chosen
by Kappa Beta. Gene Guarino. for
SLS. Bill Marsland. representing
EDR. and Stan Glpp for Sayles
