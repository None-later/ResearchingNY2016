Construction Work
To Continue 2 Weeks

An extensive program of physical
improvement to the campus has
continued through into the first
weeks of the new semester. Many
projects begun during the summer
have not been completed on sclicd—V
ule mainly because of a scarcity of
skilled labor and the inability to
obtain material.

In the lower halls of Draper work-
men are finishing putting in new
terrazzo floors which run from the
Commons to the Annex. First floor
Draper has newly painted walls and
sanded floors. Repairs have been
made to the water heater and pi c;.
'l‘lic chemistry laboratories have new
floors and new equipment is order - l.
The walk in front of Huestcd and
the ledges on the Hill of Milne have
been repaired. Fluorescent lights
have been installed in the Publica~
tions Oflicc and more shrubbcry has
been planted in front of Draper,
lluested, and I‘lawlcy.

The administration believes that
the construction program will be
completed within two weeks.

ALBANY, NEW YORK, FRIDAY, SEPTEMBEIf

 

So, Fresh—You’re Here;
Welcome, and Have Fun

Where oh where are the ver-
dant freshmen? Your guess is
as good as anyone’s, what with n
fresh camp etc. It seems it is
going to be a little more difficult
this year to get to know these
charming additions to the student
body.

They come from North, South,
East and West. From the sound-
bound shores of the Hudson
River to the falls-sprawled banks
of Niagara. Some are tall, some
thin, some cute, and a multitude
01' other adjectives. And one and
all they have come to add their
contributions to the halls of State.

We'll get to know you in time,
fresh. The upperelassmen are
glad to see you. So, far the ump—
tecnth time, welcome to State!

 

Sikorsky Speaks
At Workshop

Educators Will Stress
Aviation in Schools

In an effort to incorporate avia-
tion into the existing curriculum of
colleges and high schools, Dr. Her-
man Cooper, Assistant Commissioner
for Teacher Education in New Yorq
State, introduced a Faculty Work~
shop in Aeronautics at State College
H'Ulll June 2.2 to June 27, 11142.

Presenting not only capable but
also colorful and renowned instruc-
tors, the State Education Depart-
ment was able to secure Igor I.
Sikorsky, Engineering Manager of
Vought-Sikorsky Aircraft, Alexan-
der P. deSeversky, author of the
current best seller, “Victory Through
Air Power," Lawrence D. Bell, Pres-
ident, Bell Aircraft Corporation, and
Roland H. Spaulding, Professor of
Aviation Education, New York Uni-
versity.

One hundred fifty teachers from
universities, colleges and high
schools of Connecticut, Rhode Is-
land, Pcnnsylvania, and New York
State attended these lectures and
discussions with the purpose of re—
turning to their respective schools
with new ideas concerning aviation
in education.

“With the war as an impetus," re—
lated Dr. Donna] V. Smith, head of
State Social Studies Department,
and chairman of the Workshop,
"aviation will become not only a
medium for destruction, but also
will become an important cog in
the progress of peace after the war."

In recent reports received by Dr.
Smith from participating members,
everyone of the teachers have been
successful in introducing aviation
into their own individual educa-
tional facilities.

Newman Honors
Freshmen at Party

Newman Club opens its 1942-3
season with a reception in honor of
the class of 1946, tonight at 8 P. M.
at Newman 11: ii. A benediction by
the Reverend Father William F. Ca-
hill, will precede the meeting. There
will be refrcslnncnts and dancing.

"Everyone is invited, so frosh or
scnior, or cvon Grad student, come
and havv a grand time!" says Wil—
liam 'l‘uckcr, '44, President of New-
man.

The annual membership drive of
Newman Club is now under way.
Other oliicors aiding him are Vice-
l’rcsident lVlac Whiting, ’43; Secre-
tary Florence (larfall, '45; and
'I‘i'easurcr Loretta Sundstroni, '43.

spiritual life of its members and to
increase the knowledge of their re-
ligion. Newman Chili is afliliated
with the Newman Club Federation.

Enrollment Size

May Demand
Slash in Budget

With the reduction in masculine
enrollment and the enforced curtail-
ment of many proposed phases in the
extra-class program of State College,
it is expected that the budget for
this year, $12,887.76 as passed last
May by me Student Association, will
be drastically cut.

To date, Finance Board reports the
sale of 737 student tax tickets. Last
year the total tax sales were 825.
if the budget passed last year is to
be maintained, although a cut seems
inevitable, it will be necessary for
every student to purchase his $14
tax as soon as possible.

War Curtails Activities

The effect of gasoline and tire
rationing has already been felt by
MAA with the elimination of sev-
eral of its important basketball
games. WAA, also, was forced to
drop plans for its annual Indian
Ladder hike, and substitute a Play—
day at Pierce I-Iall instead. Fresh-
man camp was discontinued this
year, probably for the duration, due
also to lack of transportation.

Finance Board members from
whom tickets may be obtained are:
Mr. George M. York, Professor of
Commerce, Dr. Edward L. Cooper,
Assistant Professor of Commerce,
Robert Bartinan, ’43, Verne Marshall
and Ben Reed, Juniors, and Nancy
Hall and Kay Moran, Sophomores.
Financial Report Released

Dr. Cooper has released the offi- "

cial Finance Board report covering
the period from July, 1941 to July,
1942. Last year, $12,882.25 was
taken in from student tax sales.
Additional money was taken in
through duplicate ticket sales, back
tax cc-ilections, and organization re-
turns. Total funds were $13,116.58
plus a cash balance of $717.10, mak-
ing the total funds available $13,-
833.68.

During the past year, Finance
Board has paid out $11,773.47 to
student organization. This total
amount, as stated, is less the re-
turns made by these organizations
to the general fund. On June 23,
19112, when this report was drawn
up, the total cash balance was $2,-
161.21. This amount has since been
decreased by the payment. of hills
and other expenses.

Finance Board will hold its first
meeting of the year in Mr. York's
oflicc, Room 303, Draper Hall, on
Wednesday at 12 noon. All mem—
bers, especially those newly—elected,
are requested to attend.

SCA to Hold

Freshman Frolic

SCA will entertain this year‘s
freshmen, all of them, at a “gigantic,
super-super” Fresh Frolic Saturday
evening in the Commons from eight
to ten—thirty. Inforinality will be
the keynote of the evening with
games, music, and skits to aid in
amusing the fresh. Upperclassmen
are definitely not invited. The First
and Second Cabinets of SCA are not
only invited, but are expected to at-
tend this evening of frivolity. Eunice
Baird and Robert Combs, Juniors,
are chairmen for the affair, and
Helen Bushnell and Curt Pfafl'.
Sophomores, are sub—chairmen.

A talent show featuring the frosh
will spotlight the evening. Since
there was no freshman camp at.
which SCA could uncover freshmen
talent, Miss Baird has requested
that members of the class of ’46 who
would like to perform Saturday con-
tact her at the dorm. The rest of
the acts for the talent show are now
in rehearsal.

There will be several get—
acquainted games, including skits
and charades. Earl Snow, '44, will
lead a community sing featuring
college songs so that the frosh may
learn all about the “Cannibal King"
and the “Huyler's Chocolates."
Dancing to the Commons' vic will
conclude the evening.

SCA will convene the first meet—
ing of the Freshman Clulr Club '46,
October 22, at which time freshmen
will be invited to join.

 

 

Smith Cheers Lonely Soldiers
With News of Pals at State

Tell it to the marines-«and the
soldiers and the sailors. That's Dr.
Donnal V. Smith's idea. Tell 'em
about State College; keep 'eiii posted
about their pals in college and their
pals iii the service.

Dr. Smith, Professor of Social
Studies, has just mailed his second
letter to some sixty odd State men
in the service. He tells them about
each other and relates all the “go—
ingson" at State besides. So don't
be surprised if He. John Doe, State,
class of thirty something, knows all
about the terazzo floors in Draper
or the absence of the coke machine
outside the Annex because D. V.
has given them all the gossip.

The Social Studies professor is
quite a Pollyanna -~he admits it
himself. “Here at State things have

gone along prctty much the same,"
he writes, “cxccpt for the war of
course." In the Marriage section of
Letter Number One, he relates,
"Wilfred 'l'hoinas, who expects one
day to pilot an airplane for the
army got married last winter to
Janey Williams. Tynan and Spraguc
did too. Also I'm afraid that
.lolnniy Alden and The Wessels gal
baVc idcas." (For a more complete
list, borrow a letter from a friend).
And in the “Wherze” Department
We learn that Mike Walrath is in
Alabama, that Jim Quinn is sta~
tioned in New Orleans. Plus iii—
formation about dozens and dozens
more scattered all over the country
~ Bob IIertel. Jack Gardephe, Fred—
die Day et cetera. et cetera.

Numerous Applicants
Create New Demand
For Greater Facilities

One of the important problems
that confronted the Alumni Asoeia-
tion last year has been solved. The
Farrell Mansion on Western Avenue,
a gift to the Alumni Association, has
been given a place in the life of
State College.

At this very minute this mansion,
once the residence of Mrs. Margaret
Farrell, is now the home of 20 fresh-
men women. And yet another fact:
the conversion of the Farrell Man—
sion into Alumni Residence Hall No.
3 has brought nearly every freshman
woman under the direct supervision
of the college housing program. In
seven short years, the dream of Dean
Annie E. Pierce has been realized.

The decrease in the number of
requests for room and board posi-
tions caused the last minute decision
to convert the mansion into a dor—
mitory, Mrs. Bertha Brimmer, Ex-
ecutive Secretary of the Alumni
Associal, announced. In two short
days, the mansion was converted
from a shadow of past glories into
comfortable and liveable quarters
for the freshmen women.

Junipers’ Furniture Used

Miss Mildred V. Shorday, head of
State's cooperative houses, has been
employed by the Alumni Associa—
tion to manage the residence hall.
However, this dormitory is in no
sense a cooperative housing experi-
ment, being under direct supervision
of the college housing authorities.
Furniture from the Junipers, a co-
operative house which did not re-
open this year, has been used to fur-
nish the third Alumni Residence.
Hall.

The bequest of this mansion was
the cause of much discussion last
year. Many plans were proposed as
uses for the mansion, the most im-
portant being its conversion into a
student union. A discussion group
was appointed by Myskania to look
into the student union possibility.
Other colleges were contacted and
other student unions visited. The
plan never matured, however, and
State College's war activities com-
pletely overshadowed all other ac-
tivities the last semester. There-
fore, the conversion of the mansion
into a dormitory came as a complete
surprise.

Time Marches On

Seven years ago, State College’s
women students lived in private
homes in Albany. The erection of
i’icrcc Hall, Alumni Residence Hall
No. i started the trend toward
group living and the Alumni Resi—
dence “all No. it completely finished
the job. Every freshman girl except
four cithci' lives at home or in a
group house on the campus. Pierce
Hall and its four cottages, the Far-
i*.ii Mansion, sorority houses, Wren
Hall and Newman Hall all house
women students. Moreland Hull
and the James Fenimore Cooper
House are Cooperative housing
projects.

Not only women's housing has ad-
vanced in the past seven years. Only

a few years ago, the majority of
male students livod in private homes.
Now, with the Alumni Residence
llall No. 2, Sayles I'lall, opened for
the second year, the majority of
male students either livo there, or
at a fraternity house. This year
Thomas More House which formerly
houscd male students houses Mil-
drcd Elley students, bringing the
male students into even closer group
living quarters.

Nelson to Discuss Reserves

Dr. Milton G. Nelson, Dean, will
meet all men in college Friday after—
noon at four o'clock P. M. in room
21) to discuss the Army Enlisted Re-
serve, V-l, V-5, V-7 and Army Air
Corps. Dr. Nelson will attempt to‘
aiichr any questions concerning
the draft problems of the men.
