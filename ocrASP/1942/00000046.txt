18, I942

 

  

By Pete Marehetta

 

It is with a deep trust in the vir-
tue of hope that the men of the class
of 1946 have started their freshman
year here at State. With this coun—
try in need of manpower, college
men arefinding it more and more
difﬁcult to ﬁnish what they started
in their freshman year. Yet, still
they come, undaunted and hopeful.
Hopeful that, even though hell is
loose on earth, they may obtain a
college education.

a ,1 It is with this in mind that we
extend a warm hand of friendship
to welcome the frosh into the sports
life of State College.

. a at 1i! it!

Starting a school year for the
'ﬁrst time since this country entered
the war, we ﬁnd that the athletic
program of the college is once again
feeling the effects of a nation at
arms.

Last spring varsity baseball was
wiped out of the State College pic-
ture principally because of trans-
portation difficulties. Now the has-
ketball schedule ﬁnds itself in a
hazardous position. Coach G. Elliot
Hatﬁeld admits the basketball situa-
tion is grave but added, “As yet we
know nothing.”

if' it it: lit

Here’s how the situation
present:

1. One college has already can-
celled its scheduled contests with
State, reducing the number of
games listed from twelve to eleven.

2. Transportation difﬁculties will
be encountered in the trip to Pots-
dam and Canton, where State is
scheduled to meet Clarkson and St.
Lawrence, respectively. This may
reduce the season’s contests to
seven, since these colleges will in
all probability cancel their games
scheduled for Page.

3. Certain Reserve Corps forbid
their members' participation in var-
sity sports. The effect of this rule
on State’s cage squad is as yet un-
determined.

4. A good number of the varsity
members who have Reserve status
are liable to call to active duty at
the end of the semester—right in the
middle of the court season.

A meeting of the Athletic Direc—
tors of the college was scheduled
for yesterday. At this meeting, the
results of which have not yet
reached us, was determined the fate
of State’s most popular sport.

We can only wait and hope.

Faculty Works/Joli)

Is Successful Venture

Dr. John M. Sayles, President of
State College, has released the com-
plete report on the Faculty Work-
shop held at State College during
the month of June. Participants in—
cluded faculty members of various
colleges throughout the state. Dr.
Saylcs, Dr. Robert Frederick, Prin-
cipal of the Milne School, and Dr.
J. Allan llicks, Professor of Educa-
tion, were the State College repre-
rcntatives on the planning coin-
mittees.

Participants in the workshop en-
rolled in one of three groups: I
Human Development and Behavior;
Il Reading, Writing and Speaking;
111 ProfeSsional Education of Teach—-
ers. The topics were discussed
through general and group meetings,
conferences with consultants and in-
dividual study.

Group I rated individual respon—
sibility, flexible schedules, pre-
planning for meetings and having
resource people available as the most
valuable of the workshop techniques.
Recreational and art opportunities
were deemed useful as balances for
other activities, for developing crea—
tivu skills and for coming to know
other people. The pro and con of
various educational beliefs was dis-
cussed, and a larger use of discus-
sion, preferably prepared discussions,
was advocated.

Group [I discussed u‘iotivatioos,
materials and procedures in regard
to its subject of communication.

Group III on teacher education
discussed procedures, philosophy, the
utilization of community resources.

The workshop accomplished its
purpose, and its sponsors, the Com-
mittee on Teacher Education of the
Association of Colleges and Univer-
sites of N. Y. State Were satisﬁed.

WAA Schedule
Offers Students
Variety of Sports

AnnuaIITennis Tourney
_ To Open Fall Season

The tfiicial WAA fall sports pro-
gram opens Monday. Win Jones,
president of WAA, plans a varied
and extensive list of sports which
should appeal to every woman stu-
dent at State.

Tennis under the leadership of
Mary Domann and Nora Giovelli
should be one of the most popular
sports of the fall season. The ten-
nis tournament, which was success-
fully completed last year for the
ﬁrst time in several years, should
ﬁnd many interested participants.
Any girl who would like to see her
name preserved for posterity on
WAA’s tennis trophy below that of
last year’s victor, Flo Garfall, should
start practice immediately.

Under the expert tuteledge of Kit
Herdman and Marion Duffy, hockey
should have an extremely successful
season. Both captains attended a
hockey conference during the last
week in August and have returned

with valuable pointers towards
forming a well—trained winning
team. The hockey season is ex-

pected to start soon.

State women will have an oppor-
tunity to enjoy archery, that sport
which is taking a major place
among the country’s pastimes. Helen
Bushnell will direct the archers.

Riding classes will be held as
usual on Saturday morning and will
be directed by June Clark.

Latimer, one of 44’s glamour incr-
maids, will be in charge of swim-
ming but, unfortunately for the men
Public Bath No. 3 will be open only
to women.

Badminton under the leadership
of Aime Ludington completes a pro—
gram of sports which should satisfy
every feminine athlete in State Col-
lege.

Definite days and hours for these
sports have not been announced but
will be posted on the WAA bulletin
board.

Piaydoy Features
Fashions, Frolic

Freshman—Pluyday will be held
tomorrow at 2:30 behind Pierce
Hall. The Freshmen Camp coun—
cilors will attempt to create for the
fresh the atmosphere of camp.

Sports will be the first order of
the day. The freshmen will have
an opportunity to show their prowess
at badminton, archery and tennis.
After a hot supper there will be a
bonfire and a sing. Then all will
go to Page Hall where the annual
fashion show, one of the highlights
of camp, will be presented. The
candlelight service on the campus
will end the festivities for the day.

Uppcrclass women are invited to
attend for the slight charge of twenty
cents. Freshmen will be admitted
free.

Cancel Pros/9 Cum/1;
No 73mm Available

The inability to secure busses for
transportation caused the cancclla-
tion of the freshman camps for tin.-
class of 1940.

This marks the first year since
frosh camp was started that an
entering class to State College did
not spend the weekend before mat-
riculation at Cossayunu Lake and
Burden Lake.

The omission of frosh camp, which
had developed into an established
tradition), came as a surprise to most
of the undergraduates. Owen Bom—
bard and Lois Hailey, seniors, who
were in charge of this year's outdoor
weekend for boys and girls. respect-
ively, regret that plans could not be
carried out as scheduled.

The freshman suffered the greatest
loss when their weekend camp was
cancelled. It offered them an ex-
cellent opportunity of getting acqua—
inted with other members of their
class in an informal atmosphere.
Here, too, the fresh would receive
a preview of the State way of doing
things.

ABSENT

 

Tom Feeney, ’43, will be among
those missing from the State Col—
lege basketball squad when the sea—

son opens this fall. The “Duke” is
stationed at Fort Monmouth, where
he is receiving training in the Signal
Corps.

Feeney was captain-eltct of the
1942-43 basketball campaign after
having played two years as a varsity
{‘cglular and one year of freshmen
)a .

 

Frosh Net Tourney
Begins Next Week

The third annual tennis tourna-
ment for the men of the freshmen
class is scheduled to begin early next
week. Harry Kensky, ’43, captain
of this year’s varsity tennis squad,
has posted a list on the men‘s bul-
letin board in lower Draper and in—
terested fresh are expected to sign
up immediately so that the matches
may be played before unfavorable
weather sets in.

This event is held each fall to
search out possible material for the
varsity squad in the spring. Added
initiative is given to this year’s
group with the necessity of filling
the berths of former Captain Henry
Brauner, and Al Stiller who were
graduated last June.

The “racketeers” will play their
games at the nearby Washington
Park courts which are still in condi-
tion. At the completion of the tour-
nament a trophy will be awarded to
the winner.

Looking the frosh ever, seeing
their healthy _red cheeks and bright
eyes, we gather that there should
be plenty of rccuits for WAA. We
certainly hope that this will be so
for the sake of both the fresh and
WAA. WAA needs active members
and the fresh will benefit in two
ways—health and friends.

As we said last year, WAA has an
important job this year. The war
makes many college activities seem
a waste of time, but now more than
ever before WAA supplies a worth
while program. Every woman in
college should be physically fit.

We hope that WAA will expand
its tournament program. We’d like
to see more Inter-House Leagues.
The success of the Bowling League.
last year warrants the expansion of
this policy. A inter—House Ping—
pong Tourney would lend zest to the
fall season.

rI'o-morrow WAA is sponsoring a
playday for the frosh. There will
be food, fun and frolic for all—free
for fresh—twenty cents for upper—
classmcn. So come and have a good
time with the other women of State.
You frosh who missed freshmen
camp this year missed one of the
most memorable events of your
college career. So come and meet
the uppcrclassmen this way.

If you're the type who likes to
take its sports in passive fashion,
sitting on the sidelines watching
others knock a ball around—then
going back to a desk to comment
in a critical vein for the world to
read, come to the Sports Department
and be one of us. We need you.
We work in enviable luxury with

fluorescent lights and everything.
Freshmen, Sophomores-apply and
you will be welcomed with open
arms.

MAA Debates
Basketball issue

Men’s Athletic Association opened
its 1942-1943 activities with a meet-
ing on Tuesday of this week. The
big issue, and practically the only
issue, was the debate over the reten-
tion or the discontinuation of inter-
collegiate basketball.

After a lengthy discussion con-
cerning the factors both pro and con
to this problem, the meeting ad-
journed without any deﬁnite decis-
ion. It was hoped that a decision
could be reached at a meeting with
the faculty athletic council. Such a
meeting is planned for the near
future in the office of Dr. John M.
Sayles, President. Owen Bombard,
'43,! does not wish to commit him-
self at present as to what the decis-
ion will be, since the spreading of
tiny more rumors would be destruc-
No.

A thorough investigation of trans-
portation facilities and other factors
involved in the basketball season is
being conducted by the athletic
council in order to insure that a
correct decision may be made in
regard to basketball. Bombard
would like to assure the student
body that a wrong decision will not
be made.

Regardless of the outcome of this
situation, Men’s Athletic Association
and Coach G. Eliot Hatfield have
decided to enlarge and extend the
intramural program. This policy is
being adopted by a great many
schools and colleges in order to take
the place of an intercollegiate pro-
gram. Boxing, wrestling, and soccer
will be new additions to the intra-
mural schedule. This is all part of
the program to help the national
government in producing men that
are physically fit, the type of man
that the country needs.

World War ll
Army Veterans

To Speak Today
English, Chinese, Dutch

Russians Represented

A miniature World War II will be
waged in Page Hall in assembly to-
day as four of the United Nation’s
active servicemen congregate to re-
count their harrowing experience on
the various battlegrounds of Europe
and Asia.

Among the heroes is an English—
man, Captain Peter Cochrane, 23,
D.S.O. and bearer of the Military
Cross of the Cameron Highlanders.
He has been in the army since the
beginning of the war fighting in
Libya and Italian East Africa.

The Netherlands’ representative
is Raden Kadir, a knight of Orange—
Nassau, who was born in Java.
Barely escaping with his life at the
fall of the Dutch East Indies, he fled
to the United States where he is now
attached to the Netherlands Inform-
ation Service.

The Chinese delegate is unique in
that she is a woman and an actress.
Miss Yung Wang received her edu—
cation at a university in Tokio but
returned to her native China to
raise funds for China's wounded
soldiers at the beginning of the Japa—
nese invasions.

There is only tentative informa—
tion available to date as to the iden—
tity of the Russian. Either Nikolai
Krasavchonko, with the thrilling de—
tails of his hair—breadth escape
through 250 miles of enemy occupied
territory, or Vladimir Policlintsev,
one of the best snipers at the Lenin-
grad front will give the vivid picture
of the Russian war arena.

These men and woman have had
reserved seats in the great Collos—
seum of International Disorder.
They have seen their trench-mates
shot down in action, their countries
ransacked and demolished, their
armies victorious and vanquished.
Their purpose is to sow the seed of
war consciousness here in America.

This group is one of several teams
sponsored by the International Stu—
dent Service and National Student
Federation of America whose job it
is to send out similar representatives
throughout the colleges and univer-
s‘iies of the world.

The group will arrive Friday
morning in time for assembly and
will remain in Albany until Sunday.
They will make their headquarters
at Saylcs Hall until their departure
for Bennington College in Vermont.

McAllister Heads
Music Council

For all intents and purposes, Jean
McAllister, '43, is President of Music
Council although she lacks the for—
and approval of the Council. Mil-
dred Mattice, "13, only other senior
member of Music Council, is not
eligible for the oflicc as long as she
maintains her office as Vice—Presi—
dent of her class. By virtue of the
fact that only Seniors who have been
Council members for a year are
eligible for the Presidency, Miss
Mattlce and Miss McAllistcr are the
sole candidates for the oflicc. Miss
Matticc stated that she considered
Miss McAllislcr a splendid person
for the position.

In the past tWo weeks, State Col-
lege has become confronted with
many problems in connection with
its major-minor oflice system, due
largely to selective service action in
regard to the men of the college.
The present problem arose when
George Kunz, ’43, President of Mn-

la," sic Council, was drafted.

No mechanism has as yet been
establis ed to cope with the prob—
lilling the ofﬁces left open.

gportant positions have produced

N YA~—Imporfant

Students desiring NYA as-
sistance must confer personally
with Miss Sara T. DeLaney,
Dean of Women, no later than
3:30 P. M., Monday.

War appropriations have cut
deeply into funds allotted to
NYA in colleges; therefore, de-
tailed reports of students’ needs
must be compiled immediately,
and handed to NYA officials, if
State College is to receive any
money this year.

It is advised that students who
do not actually need NYA as—
sistance in order to remain in
college do not make applications
in view of current conditions.

When and if the N.Y.A. ap-
propriation comes through, no-
tices will be sent to all those
students who have applied in
Miss Delaney’s office, and at that
time more detailed applications
will need to be ﬁlled out.

 

Sororities Plan
Open Houses

Frosh to Visit Houses
For Half-Hour Periods

The open rush period for sorori-
ties, the first step in their campaign
for freshmen, will draw to a close
Thursday and Friday when the ser—
orities, seven in number, hold their
open houses. From 7 to 10 p. m.
Freshmen women will visit the
houses in three groups divided al—
pliabetically. They will be enter-
tained with dancing and refresh—
ments for one—half hour at each
sorority. A fifteen minute interval
will be allowed for reaching their
next destination.

On Thursday night open houses
will be conducted by Kappa Delta,
Alpha Epsilon Phi, and Phi Delta
in that order; on Friday by Psi Gam—
ma, Chi Sigma Theta, Beta Zeta, and
Gamma Kappa Phi.

After Friday night Freshman are
asked to observe carefully the rules
in the Handbook regarding non-
rush period which extends until the
beginning of formal rushng on De-
cember 4. Verna Snyder urges up-
perclassmen to brush up on rules
which have been added this year.

Delis Calls Finance Meeting

Ellen Dells, "48,, Student Auditor,
was appointed by the Student Board
of Finance, has called a meeting of
the treasurers of all organizations
receiving Student Association sup-
port. The meeting is to be held
Tuesday, in Room 209 at 3:30 P. M.

Fraternity Smoker
Tomorrow Night

Parties for Freshmen
Scheduled Next Month

The ﬁrst red-letter day on the
fraternity rushing calendar is to-
morrow. At that time the annual
Interfraternity Smoker will be held
from 8 to 11 P. M. in the Lounge.
Joseph Levin, ’43, is in charge of ar-
rangements, and promises a good
time for all. Freshmen men will be
be introduced to ofﬁcers of various
campus organizations, sing “ye olde
college songs,” play cards and smoke
free cigarettes.

The smoker is only the beginning
of the rushing season. Rushing
rules are quite uncomplicated for the
men as compared to those for the
women, since among other things,
the lucky males have no “silent
period.” However, they will be kept
busy and entertained by the many
fraternity parties to be held in their
honor.

KB and KDR will start the ball
rolling on October 10. SLS extends
an invitation for the 16th Potter
Club for the 30th. KB and KDR
will again hold parties on the Blst
respectively. On November 6, Pot-
ter Club again entertains SLS on the
7th, KDR on the 13th, KB on the
14th, SLS on the 20th, and Potter
Club the let. Bids will come out
on the 23rd, the day before Thanks-
giving vacation, so that Freshmen
will have a few days to make up
their minds.

Forum Members
To Hear Rienow

Dr. Robert Rienow, Assistant Pro—
fessor of Social Studies, will speak
to members of the Forum at its first
meeting of the year Wednesday at
2:30 P. M. in the Lounge. He will
talk informally on the value of
Forum meetings to every college
student. Dr. Rienow has further
confirmed his opinion that Forum is
worthwhile by making it compulsory
for all his political science classes.

Forum Board will be introduced
and plans for the year discussed.
These include a “rumor clinic" to
be directed by Rita Hickey ’43, and
the County Assembly of Hi-Y under
the supervision of Verna Snyder '43.
Forum also plans to investigate the
budgets of various college organiza—
tions so that there will be definate
facts and figures to present to the
student body at the annual budget
meeting.

Free Advice Given Fresh Girls
For Sorority Welcomes Next Week

By Lucille Kenny

"May 1 cut in on this charming
Freslnnan‘.’” Lights will burn
brightly in campus sororities Thurs-
day and Friday evenings when
women of '46 tread hitherto forbid—
den tcrritory at "open houses.”
Without doubt, they will meet more
different types of people and drink
more different kinds of punch than
ever before in their young and bril-
liant lifetimes. A chat with one, a
dance with another, this one blond,
that one brunette, some with glam—
orous long bobs, others with sporty
feather cuts, but all soiling—for
gaiety will be the theme. There
will be no solitary corners into
which a bashful freshman may re-
cede. Those sorority gals are in—
sistent persons and they'll gather
her to their midst, blushes and all.
Even those Fresh who shed tears on
their pillows nightly will feel at
home. They will explore from gate
to garrct, from spacious parlors to
the “little hells." And, for heaven's
sake, Fresh, admire all! Many a day
was spent taking up bright new cur-
tuins and dubbing paint brushes on

woodwork to make the place what
it is, Believe it or not those sophis—
ticated upper class women, now
clad in smart high heels and Vogue's
latest arc marvelous house keepers.

Another tip- -if it's chilly your
coau will be a valuable article, so
rcmembcr where it is placed, for in
the rush that concludes each visit
no one else will.

Also, fair young maidens of the
class of '46, you are warned to be—
ware of local boys while traveling
to your next destination, who whistle
when you pass. Don't stop. Stick
to the soft drinks and cookies.

After the last door closes at 10
l-'. M. Friday evening, you'll yawn
conteiitcdly and discuss "bests" on
the way home, But there are Weeks
and weeks ahead before the Judg-
ment Day, so relax for a while and
digest the punch. Those evenings
will be important besides entertain-
ing, so tuck away all memories and
impressions for future reference.
Remember, perhaps you are destined
to be some happy sorority's Christ-
mas present.

 

Fred Shoemaker, ‘44, will be Gen—
eral Chairman of the Junior Recep—
tion for the freshmen tonight.

 

Part-Time Jobs

SI'IOW increase

Labor Shortage Offers
New Job Opportunities

"With a definite labor shortage
threatening the Capitol District, op—
portunities for students desiring part
time employment shall increase," ex-
plained Harold Feigenbaum, ’4'3, Di—
rector of Part-Time Employment
Bureau. Students, freshmen. as well
as upperclassmcn, desiring part—time
positions should make arrangements
immediately to file applications and
secure interviews with his staff at
the PTEB desk in the Dean of
Women’s oflicc. No leads shall be
given to any student who does not
comply with regulations concerning
applications and interviews.

A social security number is re-
quired, but applications may be
made before securing one. They
can be obtained in room 622 in the
National Savings Bank Building at
90 State Street. Each application
should contain at least two refer—
ences, preferably ones with Albany
addresses.

Students are reminded that the
result of every lead, whether it be
a success or failure, must be report-
ed to the PTEB immediately follow-
ing interviews with employers. Sub-
sequent rccoinmendations will not be
given to any student who does not
report his results. A schedule of
the hours available for interviews
with members of the PTEB staff is
posted on the desk in the PTEB
ofﬁce.

Deadline Today
For Tax Payment

Student Finance Board, through
its clmirman, Robert Bartman, "13,
states that all students must pay
their student tax today, or a list of
the names of those in default will
be sent to Dean Nelson's oflicc and
suilahlc action will be taken.

Of the total collcgc enrollment of
886 students, only 749 have pur—
chased studcnt tux tickets. This
ticket entitles the holder to free ad—
mission io the Advanced Drannitics
plays, subscriptions to the State Col—
lege News, membership in Student
Association, etc.

The student budget was made out
last spring in anticipation of a full
enrollment of one thousand, and
consequently all budget appropria-
tions have been necessarily givun a
blanket cut of more than 10"...

Last year 850 tax tickets were
sold, with 85 students to default.

Juniors Schedule ‘
Frosh Reception
For This Evening
War Eliminates Many
Orientation Activities

The class of 1944 will play hosts
tonight to their sister class, the
freshmen, when they meet and greet
them in the Gymnasium at 8:15.
Richmond Young, class president,
will start the ball rolling with a short
welcome. The Juniors, in ex—rivalry
style, will then display their in-
genuity in the presentation of a skit,
originated, directed, and consisting
entirely of ’44 members. According
to custom, the plot will be enveloped
in secrecy until presentation. The
remainder of the evening will be
left for dancing and refreshments.
Music this year will be furnished by
the “vic” in contrast to other years
when music was by an orchestra.

Richmond Young points out that
this is the last such affair that the
Juniors will produce and therefore
he urges everyone in the freshman
class to attend. Fred Shoemaker,
chairman of the affair, promises all
a gala time.

Inasmuch as this is the first re-
ception tendered to the new class
yet this year, Young urges, “This is
your opportunity to meet your sister
class, Fresh, so let's see you all there
tonight.” The war has made many
inroads into college activities and
none more than freshman orientation
plans. The new class this year have
not had the same opportunity to
meet the upperclassmen and faculty
as past classes have had upon en-
tering the college. First, Freshman
Camp was cancelled and more re-
cently the President’s reception was
written off the list of freshmen ac-
tivities this Fall. Therefore, remain-
ing are the Junior and Sophomore
receptions and the church welcomes
which are slated for Sunday night.

Committees include, skit, Han-
nelore Schoen; music, Bill Marsland,
Gil Snyder; refreshments, Herb
Brock, John Mould. The cast of the
skit includes Rhona Ryan, Dora
Aungst, James McFeeley, Harold,
Ashworth, Gil Snyder, Paul Bar-
sclou, Rod Frazer. Bob Loueks, Art
Soderlind, Mary Studebaker, all-
Juniors.

S C A and Churches
Hold Frosh Receptions

Student Christian Association,
in cooperation with the Albany
churches, will hold its annual recep-
tions for Freshan Sunday. Ac—
cording to Emily Blasiar, ’43, Presi-
dent of Student Christian Associa—
tion, this year the receptions will be
in conjunction with the regular
evening Young People’s groups.
These churches entertaining Uie
