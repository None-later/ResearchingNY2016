vIntramural lbs for, some time -

been no, more thana name to many
of_'tft§ male students of ’this college.
Although Intramural council pre-
sents a'yaried 'spdrts program, the
same group of students play football
in‘the' fall, basketball in' the winter,
 softball in' the spring. The
0 ,e'r'sf' prefer to remain just spec-
tators. ‘ g ,
:Tli‘ese non-active students fail to
realize‘ the“ importance of participa-
tion in' sports.‘, In previous years
there have ‘been entirely too many
spectators here at State. '

- Intramural Council found it neces-
sary at times to cancel some of its
activities. Last year the men's
dorm, housing about ﬁfty men,
found it impossible to maintain two
squads in intramural leagues. This
would have necessitated a response
from only one quarter of the mem-
bers, but even' this small percentage
could not be attained. A similar
situation evidently existed in those
fraternities with thirty or more
members, since they also were able
to ﬁeld only one team.

Place for All

Bill Marsland, president of Intr; -
mural Council, has assured this de-
partment that there is a place in
their program for every man in the
college. “More teams can certainly
be formed," he said, “and if there
are too.many teams, we can run two
leagues in any one sport.”

The building of a strong, healthy
body while in college is just as im—
portant as the.’ development of the
mind. With most of the men as
prospective. soldiers, sailors, or ma-
rines, physical ﬁtness is no longer
a personal matter, but a national
need. ‘3' '

Very few students receive mus-
cular. exercise outside of the college.
Therefore, intramural sports offer
an excellent opportunity for every-
one to help themselves and Uncle
Sam physically. There should be no
reason why every man. in the col-
lege is not physically ﬁt.

‘But why did' it take the war to
remind State College students that
physical training is essential? It
seems .rather ridiculous to us that
the necessity of this training was
not realized before.- Let us hope
that after the war a more extensive
physical training program than has
been followed in the past will be
emphasized by the administration.

Basketball to Stay

State College will have a varsity
basketball team this year. The deci-
sion was made late last week at a
joint meeting of MAA and the
faculty athletic council in the presi—
dent’s office. It came at a time when
rumors had most of the college con-
vinced that there would be no bas-
ketball this coming season.

The lone game that was cancelled
by Cooper Union was scheduled with
RPI, with whom the New York city
school also cancelled its game. Other
transportation adjustments were
made and State will open its basket—
ball season as scheduled.

Frosh Tennis Opens
Fall Sport Activities

The annual frosh tennis tourna-
ment got under way yesterday of-
ternoon at the Washington Park
Courts. Some promising netsmen
have been bracketed and talent for
next year’s varsity squad will prob—
ably reveal itself.

Harry Kensky, who is in charge
of this event, stated that he believed
the matches would be as successful
as the last one although greater dif—
ficulties have been encountered this
year than in the past.

The lack of frosh camp, the tradi-
tional "event-forecaster” and the ab—
sence of a men's bulletin board in
lower Draper have made it harder
to contact all the freshmen aspir-
ants.

It is hoped that the present good
weather will continue so the tourna-
ment may be brought to a comple—
tion quickly. Following the pre—
cedent set last fall, a trophy will be
awarded by Intramural Council- to
the final victor.

Coach Hatfield Plans ‘
Difficult Obstacles
To Defy State Men

The most extensive physical edu-,
cation program ever to be presented
on the State' College campus is be-
ing considered and planned by the
administration and Men’s Athletic
Association. Heading this program
will be commando training as pre-
scribed by the State Department of
Education, all regular intramural
sports on an enlarged basis, and em-
phasized physical training in the gym
classes. The object, of course, is to
toughen the male attendants of State
College who, according to President
Sayles, “have had for some time a
reputation of the opposite nature."

Hatfield in Charge

Coach Hatﬁeld, who will have
charge of this program, will have his
hands full, for by order of the State
Department of Education, every man
in college must participate. When
boxing, pushball, wrestling, wall-
scaling, and rail—running begin,
there will be no spectators among
the men of State.

Bruises and aches are expected to
be plentiful for some time, but it is
the opinion of the college adminis-
tration and the State Board of Edu-
cation that these will be of more
value than harm.

“Everything Goes”

Roughness in the “everything
goes" manner will characterize the
gym class games, but calisthentics
will also be stressed. Condition, not
enjoyment, will be the purpose.

The college campus will be the
scene of this commando training
throughout the year, rain, snow, or
shine. The trainees will be ex—
pected to climb or vault the peri-
style walls, and run the length of
the cement rails in front of Draper.

Other Obstacles Planned

Besides these obtacles, the coach
is planning hurdling, rope-jumping,
ditch-leaping, ladder-climbing, and
barrel-crawling and everything else
which will defy the muscles of
State’s men. Coach Hatfield answers
all those who doubt their ability to
do these things with, “You’d do it
if the Japs were chasing you with
bayonets.”

MAA asks the cooperation of
the student body in this endeavor,
and in turn pledges its aid to the
administration. State is not a
pioneer in this project since both
R. P. I. and Union in this district
have successfully introduced this
program. The authorities are deter—
mined that State, too, will be suc-
ccssful.

WAA Program
To Begin Monday

The WAA fall program swings
into action next week. At the
council meeting last Tuesday, defi-
natc days and hours were assigned
to tennis, hockey, badminton and
archery.

Dot Townsend, junior representa—
tive on council, was appointed re-
porter. She will act as liason officer
between council and the News. This
is a major step towards keeping the
Woman student properly informed
of their sports program.

Hockey will be played every Mon—
I’. M. on the Pierce Hall field. Kit
I'lerdman, '44, and Marion Duffy, '45,
are in charge. Ten hours are neces—
sary for credit in this sport.

Tuesday and Thursday from 3:30
to 4:30 P. M. will find the women
playing badminton on the lawn bo-
hind the library under the direction
of Anne Ludington, '44. Those de-
siring credit in badminton must
spend ten hours batting the bird
about.

Archery is scheduled for Monday,
Wednesday and Friday at 3:30 P. M.
under the leadership of Helen Bush-
nell, '45. The girls will have to
spend ten hours on the lawn of the
library to gain credit for archery.

BatvFrey, '44, has been appointed
head of Lotta Bunkers, taking the
position of Teddy Jay, who has
transferred her allegiance to Middle-
bury College.

G. Elliot Hatfield, athletic coach of

new commando training program.

 

Grogan to Groom
Milne's Athletes
For Coming Year

By Ernest Mcnnillo

Recently appointed coach at Milne
High is tall, blonde and handsome
Harry James Grogan, an all—round
regular guy. He is taking the place
of Kooman Boycheff, last year’s
coach, who is reportedly in the
Army at the present time.

However, girls, don't get excited
over the description, for Mr. Grogan
is already married and has a nine
months old baby boy. Asked if he
had any plans for the young one, he
replied, “He'll be playing on the
varsity in about a year."

When finally located, he was hard
at work with his managers, arrang-
ing his basketball schedule. He has
high hopes for a full season, plan—
ning sixteen games. He expects to
take the team on one long trip. Mr.
Grogran is deeply impressed with
Milne and expects to stay at least
till the end of the school year since
he has a 3-A draft rating.

Born in Schenectady, he attended
Halsey, Washington Irving Inter-
mediate School, and Nott Terrace
High. He attended Cortland State
Teachers' College and graduated in
1940. While there he played varsity
basketball and baseball. When
asked why he didn't play football,
he responded that one of his cousins
was seriously injured at the sport
and, in addition, he, himself, was
hurt while working on the parallel
bars. These two events brought an
emphatic "no" from his family to-
ward his designs on football. On
leaving Cortland, Mr. Grogan taught
at Kinderhook High and later at
Tully Central.

At the present time he is living
at Sayles Hall. However, he plans
to live with his family in Delmar
a little later in the year. “There is
only one thing wrong with this,"
says Mr. Grogan. “Since Bethlehem
Central and Milne are such deadly
rivals, I don't know whether or not
I'll be able to travel back and forth
between the two places."

Intramural Council
Plans to Expand

Athletic Program

Dorwaldt Will Examine
Football MenWednesday

Faced with the job of expanding
intramural athletic activities to keep
in tune with the times, Intramural
Council held its first meeting of the
school year under President Bill
Marsland last Tuesday and proceed-
ed to lay the groundwork for its
program.

Art Flax and Charles Capel, re-
presentatives to the council from KB
and SLS respectively, took charge
of football and met with Coach Hat—
field this week to put a schedule
together.

Examinations Wednesday

Dr. Dorwaldt gave notice that
examination for all intramural foot—
ball players will be held on Wednes-
day between 6:30 and 7:30 P. M. At
positively no other time, he‘stated,
will examinations be made. Repre-
sentatives to the council from all the
intramural teams, Marsland from
KDR; Reed, Potter Club; Wood—
worth, Sayles Hall; Ruback, College
House; Kiley, Ramblers; and Capcl
and Flax, will make up the lists of
those to be examined.

It is important that those inter-
ested in playing football see the
proper representative immediately.
Boxing Planned

A step toward greater intramural
expansion was taken with the ap-
pointment of Bert Kiley to the post
of organizer of intramural boxing.
It is expected that boxing will start
with the close of the football season.

Not in many, many years has
physical fitness through physical
exercise been as important as this
year. To quote President Marsland,
“With the war situation as it is, the
fellows should get behind this thing
and make this a banner turnout
year."

Expansion of the intramural pro-
gram has given rise to the suggestion
that medals representative of the
sport engaged in be awarded the
members of the winning teams. Ed
Reed was appointed to look into the
matter and report to the committee
at its next meeting.

Hi there, frosh. By this time
everyone else has greeted you and

urged you to join one thing or an-.

other; now I’m in the mood. You’re
probably swamped at this time with
clubs and more clubs. And still
maybe you haven't allotted any
hours for war work yet. So there’s
that to think about. It’s all true.
You're busy and you can’t do every-
thing. But here I am with still an-
other ‘activity for you—~WAA. When
you're making out that busy sched-
ule of yours, give two or three hours
a week to athletics. Go riding—-
horses are nice individuals even
when you fall off. Play hockey—-
you'll probably meet some of your
best friends by banging them in the
shins. Why not go swimming?
There’re always guards to make cer-
tain that what goes down comes up.
Badminton is a great sport, one of
the few that gives you a chance to
bat the bird instead of getting it. So
be athletic, frosh, and then when
you want to join the WAVES or the
WAACS, you'll be l-A in the Army.
By profess of devious channels of
reasoning you are sabotaging the
war effort at State if you do not
look at the WAA bulletin board.
Want us to explain? We thought
that you would. This is how we
reason. WAA ls keeping what seems
to be a minor part of a ton of
thumbtacks from the scrap metal
drive just to pin up signs for the
women of State. Thus, if you neg—
lect the bulletin board, you are mak—
ing valuable metal serve no purpose.
Or don't you see it that way?
Anybody want to bet a thin dime
that bowling won't be the most
popular sport at State this winter?
We'll take on all comers 'cause by
the way the wind of talk is blow—
ing, people are even more interested
last year when bowling brought out
in bowling this year than they were
so many active keglers. We’ve
heard rumors that even Chi Sig
which isn't the most athletic soror-
ity on campus, plans to have a team
this year. Psi Gamma, winner of
the bowling trophy last year, has a
good chance to repeat since Win
Jones and Pat Gibson, star bowlers,
are back this year. Newman Hall
and Gamma Kappi Phi, who tied for
second place, will again be there in
the bowling for the handsome
trophy. But no matter who proudly
bears it home to place on the shelf,
there will be fun for all the keglers.

WAA Tennis Matches
Open to Contestants

The annual tennis tournament
sponsored by WAA is now open to
participants. All those wishing to
enter should either contact Mary
Domann, ’44, or Nora Giavelll, '45},
tennis captains or sign up on the
WAA bulletin board. Eight girls
have already entered the contest.

Last year the victory of Flo Gar-
fall, Soph class president, marked
the first completed tennis tourna-
ment since lfl37. (larfall and Cliav—
elll, last year's runner-up, are both
in competion again.

As usual the matches will be
played on the Washington Park
courts. (fumes will begin as soon
as possible.

Mattice Named
Sen.or President
By Myskania

Nominations for Officers
Made Yesterday Noon

Myskania has proclaimed Mildred
Mattice President of the Senior
Class. This office was vacated by
the drafting of Thomas Feeney, ‘43,
into the United States Army. Be—
cause of' the absence of a class con—
stitution, the question was thrown
in Myskania's lap. Thereupon, Mys—
kania observed natural custom and
elevated the Vice—President in this
case, Miss Mattlce, to the presidency.

There are several other offices
which have to be filled for various
reasons. Some of the office-holders
left school; others hold duplicate
offices and must resign from one.
Vice-Presidency Vacant

Miss Maltice's appointment to the
presidency leaves a vacancy in the
office of Vice-President of '43. A
Representative to Finance Board
must be chosen from the class of
'43, as Jack Smith has transferred
to Cornell. Winifred Jones, '43, was
elected President of WAA and WAA
Manager, and as it is impossible to
occupy two offices on WAA Coun-
cil, a new manager must be chosen
from the class of '43.

The office of Sophomore Repre-
sentative to WAA was vacated by
Mary Now, '45, who is the Secretary
of WAA. The class of '44 needs a
new secretary because Kay Doran,
elected to that office last May, is no
longer in school. Collin Barnett,
chosen secretary of '45 last spring,
has left school also, creating a va—
cancy in that office.

Classes Ilohl Nominations

Class meetings at which nomina-
tions were held for these offices took
place yesterday. Lists of the can—
didates will be posted for two weeks.
During this period additions may be
made by contacting any member of
Myskania.

Mysknnla also announced that. it
has certified the election of Jean
fVIcAlllstcr, '43, to the presidency of
Music Council. Miss McAlllstcr
was chosen president by that council
on Wednesday.

Forum Pledges
Full War Effort

“Forum will be the recruiting
body for college war activities," do-
clared Dr. Robert Rienow, adviser
to Forum in the meeting Wednesday.
This is to be the theme emphasized
throughout the year. Dr. Illcnow

speech, also an—
nounced [but all

pected to make

democratic organ-
ization by pre-
scnting and dis—
cussing lhclr in-

No Tax Payments

To Be Refunded

New Ruling Will Stop
Drastic Cuts in Budget

Finance Board has stated: "There
will be no refund of the Student
Tax during the year for any reason
whatsoever," as a result of its meet-
ing held Wednesday.

The final budget, after debate
and a vote by the Student Associa-
tion last year, was fixed at $12,852.75.
At that time it was proposed that
a higher Student Tax assessment be
imposed for this year. However,
the tax remained at $14, and with
an enrollment of 386 a further bud—
get cut became imminent. At pres-
ent count 78:") students have pur-
chased their tax tickets, and already
some refunds have been made.

Taking into consideration the
number of students who will soon
be inducted into the Armed Forces,
the Finance Board estimates pay-
ment of a total of 800 taxes and is
planning accordingly.

Further refunds of tax payments
to students leaving school would
necessitate drastic cutting of the
budget which has already been
given a blanket cut of more than
lflﬁl. In this event many organiza—
lions Would be forced to cease their
activities.

In explaining why the student
body has not been consulted in
this action, Mr. George M. York.
Professor of Commerce and Advlsor
group. "The students on Finance
to Finance Board, spoke for the
Board, elected by the Votes of their
respective classes, arc representa-
tive of the student body," said Mr.
York. "While such a ruling may
seem arbitrary, it was necessarily
passed before a large number of
tax payments had bccn rcfumlcd."

the f‘ollogc, npplovcd the action of

Chino Again Represented Here;
_ Miss Kuo to Lecture in Assembly

By J. Michael llippick

Beauty and brains—with the ac-
cent on both. That’s what Debate
Council is offering to those attending
this morning’s assembly. Miss
Helena Gin-Chiu Kuo, a native of
China, ﬁts the above description.
Unique also is the fact that Miss
Kuo’s appearance will mark the sec—
ond time within a week that a vet-
eran of Japanese invasion will have
spoken to students of State College.

Well known as a journalist, author,
and lecturer, she draws her material
from extensive travels in Europe,
Asia, and the Americas. Students’
interest will not only be held by the
material content of her lecture, but
also by the delightful, enticing (not
curves) method of presentation.

Since driven out of her homeland
by the Japs, Miss Kuo has been sec—
lng the world on her own for the
past two years. Her enviable career
has included writer for the London
Daily Mail, two visits to the White
House, study in the University of
Shanghai, and association with many
important officials now serving the
United Nations.

Other achievements by this joyous
example of young emancipated Chi-

nese womanhood include writing

two books entitled “Peach Path”

and “I’ve Come a Long Way.” The
former is a discourse on Chinese
women and the philosophy of these
interesting people. The other is her
life story. “Peach Path” was Writ-
ten in three months in a little village
in southern France. Her autobiog-
raphy has been acclaimed by many
as an enthralling and eloquently
told account of a varied life.

Many points of her lecture will be
of supreme interest to the fairer sex
of the college. Miss Kuo gives a
keen comparison of the role played
by the women of China and America
in the home, business, and their
legal status. A vivid and fascinat-
ing story of China's new spirit, com-
bined was an excellent interpreta-
tion of Chinese art should contain
the answers to unspoken questions
which we all harbor. The searching
challenge she gives to American
womanhood is downright thrilling.

Debate Council has instituted this
feature of its program in answer to
criticism pointed at the council last
year to the effect that not enough
students were gaining benefit from
its activities.

 

Air Raid Suggestions

If State had really been sub—
jected to an air raid in week ago
yesterday, it is assumed that there

would have been a considerable .

number of casualties. The pre-
cautions prcscribcd by the War
Council were not entirely heeded
and in many cases reality would
h:ch iHVolvcd disaster.

Gas attack may have been fatal
to many, as windows in several of
the class rooms were not closed.
Books should not be carried from
classes, but students should rc-
movc their pocketbooks.

An air raid drill is not com-
pleted until students have filed
back into classes; therefore, the
return must be just as orderly as
the departure. Speed and silence
must be scrupulously observed.

War Activities
Work Resumed

In an effort to correlate all college
activities with the war effort, the
War Activities Council has resumed
its work for the year 1942-43.

Stress on actual war activities as
opposed to a predominance of col-
lege war courses will be made in an
attempt to accomplish something
tangible. Every opportunity to par-
ticipate in realistic measures drawn
up by either national or local civilian
defense organizations will be given
first cullsldl-i'nlloll. All scrap drives
as Well as conservation measures
will lH' minutely observed.

A schedule of complete plans for
the ycar will bc revealed by Miss
Sara '1‘, l)cl.nncy, Dean of Women
and Fondly Member of War Council
as a port of next Friday's assembly.
Immediately following the assembly
program a pamphlet will lu' dis-
lrlbuled outlining the War Activities
(‘ouncll rcc:mmn-ndntions for stu-
dent war Work. Registration for
Ihc wnr Work will Inkl- place on
the following Monday, allowing
students the weekend to cullnlllt't‘
Iln- lypi- of Work they anticipate
doing. All prlnlcd lnfornullion lbal
the Council wishes to disseminate
will be complch through line efforts
of the Soup Iio.r, its olliclol news
organ.

Various collcgc organizations will
be oskcd to take on actIVe part in
the Council Work. 'l'he Albany
Boys' Club requested a dramallcs
director; Advanced Dramatlcs may
be able to give them some help.
Art slmlonts will be given an op-
portunity to express their talents
by painting posters pertaining to
war conditions.

 

D & A to Elect
2 New Members

Nils Hogncr, Artist,
Will Be Fall Lecturer

Drmnatlcs and Art Council an—
nounces that two new members are
to be selected from the Junior
Class at its meeting Wednesday.
The new members are to replace
Doris Lichtwart, ’44, who did not
return to school, and Arthur Sodcr-
lind '44, who will be inducted into
the army within the next month.
Sodcrlind is also the treasurer of
that council, so that position will
also have to be filled. The new
members of the council will not
only be chosen from those who
have tried out in past years, but
from those members of the Junior
(floss who are earnestly interested
in dramatics and art.

Dramatics and Art's fall presen-
tation will be an informal lounge
ion at which Nils Hogncr, the em-
inent artist and book illustrator,
will be the speaker. This is one
of the few pure art displays that
I‘) 8' A presents. Mr. Hogncr is
particularly an illustrator of chil-
dren's books. He is a friend of
our Dr. Stewart of the Social
Studies Department. Perhaps the
students may remember the exhibit
in the library last spring of charm—
ing Mexican drawings that were
given to Dr. Stewart by Mr. Hogncr.
Mr. l'Iogncr's lecture will be as near
"Book Week" as possible, He will
have an exhibit of his art ill the
lounge lo illustrate his lecture, All
Stale students especially interested
in art are invited lo the lecture and
