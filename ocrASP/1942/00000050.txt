Intramural Football

Page Hall campus will be the
scene of football activities in the
afternoons as the intramural touch-
tackle football season got its start
yesterday. This inaugurated the
intramural program for the college.

Among the missing from this
year’s league members will be
"grand old” College House._ The
Central Avenue group found it im-
possible this year, to put a team
on the field for the first time smce
the league was started, back in the
fall of ’38.

Sayles Hall has entered two
squads again this year, and as re-
liable sources have it, the two
teams will be maintained through-
out the season. Another addition
to this year's roster of teams is
“The Finks.” Though the name is
new, the faces are familiar as they
are the remnants of the former
Thomas More lads.

Rules and Referees

Elsewhere on this page are pub-
lished the rules which will regulate
the football games. It was request—
ed that all players, especially the
fresh, read them carefully. In this
way it is intended to avoid any
controversy that may arise during
the contests.

Art Flax and Charlie Capel, who
are in charge of football, are on
the lookout for more referees for the
current season. A list will be placed
on the MAA bulletin board, and
all juniors and seniors desiring to
arbitrate contests are asked to sign
up.on that list or see Flax or
Capel personally.

Cross-Country

We hear from the freshmen that
cross-country, a varsity sport of
two years ago, is returning to State,
well, maybe not as an intercollegiate
sport, but as a routine of gym
classes.

Instead of the soccer-football
schedule of previous years, Hatfield
has switched over to running. The
lads can be seen over at Washing-
ton Park scampering up and down
hills and jogging ’round the lake.

The introduction of running in
the gym class period is in keeping
with the physical fitness program.
To this department no better sport
than running could be chosen to
keep the men of the college in
the best physical condition. Plus
strengthening the legs, running dc-
velops heart, lung, and intestinal
muscles. Participation in this sport
also results in long-windcdness and
stamina, very important to us, as
future men of the Service.

Some men, under their own in—
itiative. have already taken up run—
ning for a physical conditioner. We
hope that many more men will
follow their cxmnpic.

Commando Course

Under Construction

Preparations arc ulrcody under—
way for the construction of the
commando course to be used in
training all State College men.
Coach Hatfield says that thc nutter—
ial has been ordered and that train—
ing will start as soon as the course
is completed.

The course is being built in n
sizu uniform with other colleges nntl
with military specifications. In this
numncr, the students may receive
whutcvor military credit may be
offered by the services for partici-
pation in commando training.

'I‘hc course is to be both large
enough for two men to run at once.
That is, the event will be more or
less competitive. Also, the time it
takes ouch man to complete the
course will be recorded. In this
way there will be on individual
record of progress in physical con-
dition and ability.

The arrangement of the course is
not yet complete. Whon it is, the
administration will require each man
In college to enter at least 75% of
the events. hoping at the some time
for 10% participation.

Commences Fall

Football Schedule

KDR, Potter, Ramblers,
Dorm A Play Opener

Intramural football made its debut
yesterday afternoon under the di-
rection of Charlie Capel and Art
Flax. Four of the eight teams open-
ed fthe 28 game schedule with
Kappa Delta Rho facing Edward
Eldred Potter Club, and Dorm A
meeting the Ramblers. The other
four teams in this six man two-
hand-touch league are Kappa Beta,
Sigma Lambda Sigma, Dorm B, and
the Finks. This is an increase of
teams in the league for although
College House dropped out, the
Finks and another Dorm' team en-
tered the competition.

All men who passed the physical
examinations conducted by Dr. Earl
J. Dorwaldt on Wednesday night
are eligible to play as long as they
remain with the teams with whom
they signed.

Play as Scheduled

Two games will be played each
Monday, Tuesday, and Thursday
starting promptly at 4:30, and this
year the “mail-toters" of State will
deliver, rain, snow, or shine. The
schedule has been drawn up and will
be played accordingly.

Last year the cup was won by EEP
with KB and Sayles Hall placing and
showing respectively. Many of last
year's players are still performing
for the fraternities or other organi-
zntions.

KDR boasts Marsland, Verrey,
and Beyer from last year's regulars
and Beach from the Dorm; EEP re-
turns with Evans, Young, Lynch,
and Combs plus Singer, Kullman,
and Gipp who played against them
last year; KB, usually a powerhouse
team, has Fcigenbaum, Levin. and
the Flax Brothers, four of last year's
six; SLS will build its team around
Guarino, Capel, and O'Connor.

Dorm Has Frosh

The Dorm teams have only Tas-
soni as a lettcrman, but the fresh--
men will flock to support their resi-
dence hall. The Ramblers, who lost
several of their first string men, still
have Marchctta, Kiley and Miller,
besides Dooley from the Dorm, and
Ruback and Wise from College
House.

The rules will rcnunn the some as
in other years, but may not be on-
forced quite so strictly because
"toughness" is now the passWord at
State.

Freshmen Racqueteers
Start Trophy Contest

With suitnblc tennis weather
rapidly growing scarce, thc frosh
tennis tournament has yet to really
got under way. To date only one
match has been playcd. Bob Fcr-
bcr decisively trounced Lazicr by

Sophs Threaten Frosh on Rivalry,-
Juniors Come to Rescue of '46

By a Sophomore

“And the condemned men ate a
hearty meal."

This epitaph will soon find a
new meaning within the hallowed
halls of State, so declared Flo Gar-
fall at a meeting of the Class of
'45 a week ago yesterday.

For, my door little frosh, you
are to be battling for your very
lives in a precious few weeks! And
you are to be fctcd once more
before the "Reds" begin to mop the
floor.

One week from today the Sopho—
more will hold their annual rc—
ception for the “greenhorns”. At
this time the two rival classes will
have the opportunity to look over
the opposition and plan thcir
methods of attack. As in the past,
the '46’crs will also have Myskania
inform them of the traditions of the
college and the inter-class rivalry
rules. How well will they learn
the true facts about the "unknown"!

The day before Campus Day,
which will be on October 17th
this year, will mark the opening
of "new business on hond~~to be
disposed of quickly and completely."
The feature event of the men's
division will he the trcnting of the
l'rosh to a “little game of muscle-
rclnxing", commonly known about
the school as pushbull. The next
afternoon the Sophs will provide at
final resting plncc for thosc who
still remain. on the football bntilc
flcld.

So frosh bcwnrc!

in thc mclmtimc you orc cordially
invited to assemble your forces,
make your low Inst ncqunintnnccs,
order n 'l‘ooy-'l‘ombstonc by simply
sending tcn box tops nnd thc mum-
of your next of kin to any mcmbcr
of the class of '45, and wait. 'l‘hc
"(.‘rimson 'l‘idc" will soc that you

RICE'S ALLEYS

Western and Quoil
15c a Game for Srhool League
From 9:00 A. M. to 6:00 P. M.

 

By a Junior

Hey there froshli It's your turn
to launch a blitzkrieg on those gay
but foolish sophomores. We did
it last year and we mopped the
halls of State, rolled the grass in
front of Page Hall, and collected a
few pairs of trousers. Only this
year, we think that you should go a
step further and dunk a few of them
in the icy waters of Washington
Park Lake.

From the looks of your class, it's
a cinch. You have the brains and
you have the brown, while the
sophs are a different type. They're
too heavy for light work and too
light for heavy work.

Let us give you a few hints on
how to beat those cocky sophs.
When you got into the pushbail
game, grab their cars, Ihcy'rc large
enough. Hit 'cm hard; they'll fold
up like on old bench chair. Then,
while they're dazzled by this dis~
play of force, roll that large pill over
them and over the goal line.

All you have to do in the foot-
ball game is to hit 'cm hard and
low, and you can breeze over them
with the grace and case that we
did. Since they warble like a chorus
of frogs on n sultry summer night,
you will sound like nightingnlcs in
comparison oi the song contest.
They are all very tongucaticd and
incxprcssivo when it comes to de—
bntc, so just stand up there and give
a fair argument and you will clinch
it. As for stunts, their skits rcmind
onc of u bunch of ham nctors doing
their strut. Just put on n poppy
stunt and you will have thcm bowing
their heads in shame.

And so, frosh, while wc hold no
bitterness in our hearts for thc
Sophs only pity; our puticncc is
about cxhnustcd by tbclr wisc ways
and cracks. Wc want you to knock
lbcir curs down and win for good
old '-'IIi. Wc. your .‘ilh‘lt't‘ ('lnss lli't‘
bucking you oil the way, so go to it.
it's all yours.

 

It Could
Be

WUI‘Z

 

From where we sit, viewing the
sports parade, WAA has missed the
boat regarding the tennis tourna-
ment. School has been in session

more than two weeks and still the '

tourney hasn’t begun. We realize
that the weather has been bad, but
there have been some good days on
which matches could have been
played.

The fall tennis season in Albany
is so short that no more time should
be lost. So, come on, WAA, get on
the ball. The interest shown in
last year’s successfully completed
tournament and in this year’s
tourney by the number of those
signed up for it, warrants immediate
playoffs. We'd like to see last year’s
newly begun record of a finished
tourney unbroken.

Short of the Week

People never appreciate what
others do for them. We of the
sports department don’t ask for
praise, however, we want you to
know the lengths to which we go to
bring you the true facts about WAA
and its sports. Two members of
the sports staff volunteered to go
riding last Saturday. Everything
went smoothly as they jogged along
over hill and date until Byrne fell
off the horse. She claims that she

jumped—but we know that ain’t,

so. After standing up through her
noon meal, she said—quote—Holy
Joc, do the WAA girls do this every
week? So you can see that we don’t
JUSl sit around all the time but
really participate in the activities
offered by WAA.

Ride at the Range

Riding is fun and grand exercise.
it is, perhaps, the most expensive
sport on WAA's list since it costs one
dollar an hour. But if you go ten
times, WAA gives you a five dollar
refund. This reduces the charge to
fifty cents an hour, a small sum for
the pleasure you receive. WAA
riding is done at The Ranch on Col-
to handle, yct spirited. If you've
vin Avenue. Their horses are easy
never been on n horse, ask for Silver
Queen, a gentle more, shaped like u
blimp, with n gnit like a milk-wagon
horse. The bridle path wcnds its
way through meadows and woods,
backyards and chicken runs, across
four-strip highways and along the
main line of the Control. And you're
accompanied by a MAN—age 15,
name Bill.

Each wock we, tho members of
the Woman's Sports Staff, are going,r
to try nnothcr of the sports offcrcd
to thc women of thc collcgc. Watch
for our amazing rcnl-lifc ndvcn—
turcswto be continued next week.

Seriously though, let's get out
there and back WAA. in these
times we should all be as physically
fit as possible. Anyone whose
stnmino is low cannot meet tbc
dcnnmds tlml thc war will bring.

Five Will Seek

Title of Queen
For Campus Day

Freshmen to Nominate
Officers at Orientation

Five girls will vie for the title of
Campus Queen, 1942 model, Mys—
kania stated today. Elizabeth
Bax-den, Psi Gamma, Emily Blasiar,
Kappa Delta, Dorothy Cox, Chi Sig-
ma Theta, Shirley Eastman, Kappa
Delta, and Mildred Mattice, Kappa
Delta, are the five nominees. Mys-
kania will supervise voting in the
Commons Monday, not only for
Campus Queen, but also for those
class offices which were vacated for
various reasons.

Five Nominees

Five is the traditional number of
nominees for the Campus Queen
honor. The only exception to this
being two years ago when an un-
precedented tie resulted in six girls
being nominated. From these five
girls who received the most votes in
Assembly last Friday, the student
body will choose one—whose name
will not be revealed until the Coron-
ation ceremonies Saturday, October

Nominations for all freshmen
offices will be made Monday during
freshmen Orientation meeting. These
nominations will then be posted for
the required two-week period (dur-
ing which time additions may be
made to the lists), and fresh-
men will cast their ballots for their
ofﬁcers on October 26.

Past Statistics

Three of the five nominees for
Ca opus Queen were also nominees
last year for Junior Prom queen:
Shirley Eastman, Dorothy Cox, and
Mildred Matticc. The other two
nominees have since left school:
Marilyn Rich and June Melville.
Mildred Mattice was chosen Junior
Prom Queen and this may give her
a decided advantage over the other
nominees. For at least the past
three years that girl who was chosen
Junior Prom queen has also been
given the honor of being Campus
Queen. Will history repeat itself?
Time——and the student body——will
decide.

Sophomores Will Entertain
'46 at Reception Tonight

Soph Plays Tarzan Role

In Hair-Raising Escapade

Oh, “He floats through the air
with the greatest of ease." Who?
Anyone in stagecraft will tell you
—it’s Dan Regan.

It’s this-a-way. Dan and four
others were sent up into the loft
after an imitation fireplace. They
attached pulleys and lowered it
with breathtaking precision. Soon,
fellow students from below saw a
figure swinging out into space a la
Tarzan. It was Dan.

Everything would probably have
worked out perfectly if the pulley
hadn’t got stuck half way down.
Have you ever dangled in space
for about 15 minutes?

Somehow, Dan feels it was
worth the nerve-wrecking tension
——just to hear Miss Hopkins sym-
pathetically inquire, “Do you
REALIZE you might have broken
that fireplace?”

Greeks to Fete
Frosh at Parties

Opening the fraternity rush party
season, Kappa Beta and Kappa
Delta Rho will play host to fresh-
men men and their guests tomorrow
evening.

Kappa Delta Rho will dress the
fraternity house in carnival colors
for the annual KDR’cade at 8:30.
From the cellar which boasts a real
bar to the top floor, there will be
booths, concessions, and special
attractions besides dancing. Her-
bert Leneker, ’43, and Fred Beyer,
'44, are co-chairmen of the event.
Said Leneker, “We'll have lots of
mysteries and surprises along with
the fun."

Inﬂuenced by the recent visit of
Vladimir Pchelintsev to the college,
KB has adopted a Russian theme
for its vic party which will begin at
8:30 in the Commons. However, the
U.S.S.R. army uniforms and vivid
tales of the war front will give
way to wooly beards, long robes, and
Russian comedy. Harold Gold-
stein, '45, Master of Ceremonies,
promises to entertain the freshmen
with “a view of ‘Roosha' in a defi-
nitely light mood.” Ira Freedman,
’43, and Gilbert Snyder and George
Erbstcin, Juniors, have charge of
arrangements.

 

Music Council
Plans to Produce

Musical Comedy

Studebaker Requests
Try-Outs for Research

Music Council will enter a new
ﬁeld when it produces on Decem-
ber 10 a musical comedy written, di-
rected by and starring college stu-
dents. Final details are not yet
complete, but the main plans have
been approved. This is the ﬁrst
time anything of this kind has been
attempted by the Council.

The theme of the comedy will be
Life at State College during the
“Gay 90’s.” To gather material for
the venture, Mary Studebaker, ’44,
in charge of the affair, announces a
research staff is needed. The job of
this staff will be to collect facts on
college life here during the last
decade of the last century. After
enough material has been gathered
a writing committee will start
work on the show. Members
of Operatic Society and freshmen
who are trying out for Music Coun-
cil are especially urged to help
gather material. Miss Studebaker
states, “After research is completed,
try-outs for parts in the musical will
be held, but nothing can be done
until we have the material gath-
ered.” She further stated that these
try-outs will be open to every stu-
dent. Rehearsals will begin as soon
as a story and music have been de-
cided upon. Miss Studebaker points
out that, inasmuch as this is a new
venture, every student should get
behind it and help make it a success.

Music for the comedy will con-
sist of “old-timer” songs of the
Bicycle Built for Two variety. There
is even the possibility that some
original music will be especially
written for the affair. However,
nothing definite has been decided.

Music Council has planned tenta-
tively to give half of the proceeds to
War Relief. This feature will re-
place the usual Music Council pre—
sentation of an outside guest artist.
Final plans for the affair were for-
mulated at a meeting of the Council
last Wednesday.

Myskania Will Read,
- Explain Rivalry Rules

The Sophomores extend their last
friendly overture to the class of ’40
tonight at 8:15 with the Sophomore
Reception, to be held in Page Hall
auditorium. This is the last big
reception this year for the honored
freshmen, and in past years has
been one of the most entertaining.

Flo Garfall, President of the Class
of ’45, will open the program with a
short speech of welcome, to be de-
livered from the stage. Myskania
will also be seated on the stage,
robed in the traditional black
gowns and caps.

Rivalry Rules To Be Read
Myskania’s part of the program is
to announce and explain the fresh-

singing of the .Alma Mater by both

classes. .

The highlight of the program will
be the presentation of the sopho-
more skit, an annual event. The
plot of the skit has been kept
secret, but the sophomores have
revealed that they have an all-star
cast, including Nora Giavelli, Sunna
Cooper, and Harold Goldstein. The
skit is under the direction of Ruth
Hines, assisted by Margaret Bost-
wick and Elsie Whipple.

Dancing, Refreshments to Follow
Following the skit the audience
will adjourn to the gymasium, where
there will be refreshments, games,
and dancing. Name tags will be
given out at the door. The floor
has been freshly waxed, and music

will issue from a vic rented for the»

occasion. In former years the danc-
ing has been held in the Commons,
but has been transferred to the
gymnasium this year because of
difﬁculty in blocking-out the Com~
mons.

“We expect a 100% turn-out of
both classes,” says Flo Garfall. “Be-
sides, the refreshments are really
goodwice cream and cookies."
