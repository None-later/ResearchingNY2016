Rivalry For Sale?

The days which were characterized by fresh-
men-sophomore rivalry in its wildest, most un-
restrained forms are gone—perhaps forever, but
at least “for-the duration." Such frivolity has
no place in an institution for higher learning
while our country is at war.

 

 

But rivalry will go on—with some of the
events changed, but it will continue. The ques-
tion now before us‘ is, what to substitute for the
mascot and banner hunts which were discon-
tinqu and which counted ll) points. It has been
suggested that rivalry points be awarded to the
class contributing most to the war effort—in
various ways, among which is the buying of war
bonds and stamps. Diverting enthusiasm for
rivalry into productive work, work that will aid
the war effort is all well and good, but. the
minute you place emphasis on buying, even
though it be war stamps, you place rivalry on a
commercial basis, something it was never meant
to be and something it should never become.
Rivalry in the past has been won by the class
that was superior in both physical and mental
prowess, and by the class with the most enthu-
siasm, not by the class whose individual mem-
bers had the most spending money.

Let's give State students. freshmen and sopho-
mores iu this case, credit for some patriotism.
And if they do have some patriotism they are
buying as many war slitnlps and bonds as they
can afford. Is it [air then to (‘.\l)(.‘(l these stu-
dents to satrilitc their lunch money, their recre-
ation money in order to win rivalry?

Let’s IIot thrust :III added financial burden on
their shoulders and let's not (.oInIIIeI'tiali/c a
long-established tradition.

General Billy Mitchell, formerly of
the United States Army, was an en-
thusiastic exponent of air power, and
of the airplane’s superiority over the
battleship. He also contended that
the country which controls Alaska
holds a dagger at the heart of con-
tinental United States. Mitchell was
a little before his times, and he was
court-martialed by those men in the
army who had not his vision and
foresight.

The Japanese, however, took his
lesson to heart, and at the ﬁrst op-
portunity landed troops on the two
most western islands of the Aleutian
chain. Despite bombings by Ameri-
can aircraft the Japs soon started
their progress to the east by occupy—
ing another island. Last week
American troops moved west to meet
this threat by landing on the An-
drcanof Islands from which Ameri-
can bombers pummeled the Japs un—
ceasingly. Yesterday morning the
Navy announced that there had been
no sign of the enemy on two of the
islands for several days, and that it
is possible that the Japs had with-
drawn all their forces to the lone
island of Kiska.

General MacArthur announced
that the Japs had also been forced
to withdraw on the Island of New
Guinea. Australian troops pushing
through the gap in the Owen Stanley
mountain range had been forced to
slow down because of the difﬁcult
terrain.

The Japanese attempted a coun—
terattack in the Solomon Islands
when they tried to land a force on
the Guadalcanal Island. Allied
bombers broke up the invasion fleet,
but the Japs did succeed in landing
some troops. I

The Russian communique says
that the city of Stalingrad is still
under heavy German assaults, but
that the lines of the defenders are
still holding ﬁrm.

Norwegian uprisings and the fear
of an allied invasion have caused the
Germans to clamp a rule of terror on
Norway. Hostages are being seized
to force Norwegian workmen to
labor on German coastal fortiﬁca-
tions. In Trondheim fifteen more
Norwegians were executed by the
Germans in connection with charges
concerning a plot to sabotage the
Trondheim naval base.

 

m and eat-M

by Ithona Ryan

 

Not too far from Albany there is a
small section of the country popu—
lated almost entirely by artists,
writers and people of such ilk. Be-
cause of the heavy percentage of
men and women who are “odd”
enough to think that some things
are more important than money and
social position, this same area is one
of the best examples of a working
democracy to be found. In fact,
there is a Saroyanesque quality
about it allsz small town banker
who pays mortgages out of his own
pocket, a grocer who refuses to col-
lect bills, a farmer who is fanatically
interested in the ballet,

I happen to have a peculiar inter—
est in South Mountain Road as the
colony is called, because Mary Mow-
bray Clarke, the founder, is my
aunt. Thirty~fivo years ago or more,
she settled in one of the pro—Revolu—
tionary farms on the road with her
sculptor husband, and proceeded to
work out It life devoted to the arts,
but based on fundamental elements,
such as farming and handicrafts.
Gradually, tnore and more artists
and writers were attracted there till-
til now the telephone directory reads
like a Who's Who Among America's
Ari Circles. The most widely»
known name is Maxwell Anderson’s.
but there are many others such as
Waldo-Pierce and Maurice Cuntot‘,
the painters, and Iiuth Reeves, the
textile designer, who are admittedly
top-rank in their special fields.

I have been fortunate enough to
stay at the “Brochen,” my aunt's
home. several times, and through her

to know and appreciate the signi—
ficance of South Mountain Road.
For this small area probably holds
Inore talent and genius per square
tnilc titan any other comparable spot
on the earth's surface. For Inore
definite proof, I invite anyone to
visit Maxwell Anderson’s home, as I
did, and to gaze spell-bound at one
of the most beautifully unified and
exquisite houses existing outside of
Frank Lloyd Wright’s Inmgination.
And every stone, timber, and piece
of Wood has come from the road it-
self, the labor was given by the
farmers and young artists, and the
furniture, paintings, rugs, etc., have
been fashioned and designed by the
South Mountain Road art colony.
Even a good portion of the books
have been written on the road.

But, to me, the most ;lIt.-artcning
result of my stay there was the final
proof that a full, i'lt'll lift-'1 depends
not on money or even intelligent-e,
but upon living as one wants,
though in eo-opcrntion with others
for the general good. It goes with—
out suying, that in most communities
this doesn’t work out at all, but
somehow it has on South Mountain
Road. But I can feel II tremendous
pride because once average citizens
scoffed at my mint for thinking that
life was more than just earning
money, and that it must embrace a
high idealism combined with a
knowledge of hard realities-~I’d like
to tell you some other time of the
hard realities she faced while South
Mountain Road became what it is~
u landmark to her own personality

and the vital truth of her beliefs.

LEST RUMOR REIGN

Dame Rumor is having a ﬁeld day with this pro-
posed commando training. As a matter of fact, the
course must be constructed before it can be deter-
mined how many are to take part; while priorities, etc.,
make it impossible to predict the date of completion.
Until then nothing is certain—that recent journalistic
gem of the Sports dep’t. notwithstanding. . . .

 

 

However, any reservist who doesn’t take advantage
of the training is being (and we quote a bigwig in our
faculty Wigwam) “soft in the head.” So, as yet, no
one knows who will comprise the State College bat-
talion of Colonel Annie's Junior Commandos. . . .

To Give Plans
ForWar Effort

Delaney Will Request
Aid of Student Body

The War Activities Courtcil, in
an effort to provide an impetus for
student war work, will present Miss
Sara T. Delaney, Dean of Women
and faculty members of the Council
to speak before the Student Asso-
ciation as part of today’s Assembly
program.

Miss Delaney will outline and
explain plans formulated by the
War Council which will take affect
as soon as student cooperation is
secured. Immediately following the
program, its members will distribute
mimeographed sheets of suggestions,
plans and regulations as applied to
students and faculty.

A personal interview by a mem-
ber of the War Council will be
afforded to each student through-
out next week from 9 AM. to
4 P. M. every day in the rotunda.
This will aid in determining the
particular aptitudes of students for
war work.

Actual participation in war work
will be emphasized this year, differ-
ing from last year’s stress upon
war courses.

As part of voluntary war activities
for which no ﬁnancial reimburse-
ments will be made, the Office of
Civilian Defense, Albany Division,
has issued a call to the War Council
for men or women to serve as part
of the night interceptor commands.
Students who have special abilities
in art will be given an opportunity
to display their talents by paint-
ing many important posters per—
taining to war conditions.

Assisting Miss Delaney as faculty
members on War Council are: Dr.
Louis C. Jones, Assistant Professor
of English, Dr. Minnie B. Scotland,
Assistant Professor of Biology, Dr.
Robert Riencw, Assistant Professor of
5.. def Studies, and Mrs. Anna K.
Barsam, Supervisor of Home Eco-
nomics in Milne. Student partici—
pants in the Council are Owen

and Rhona Ryan.

Tragedy, Comedy Open
Year's Dramatic Season

Advanced Dramatics will open its
fall season Tuesday night at 8:30
in Page Hall auditorium, with the
presentation of two one—act plays.

The first play, a tragedy, is di-
rected by James McFeelcy, '44. It
is the story of a young man who
commits murder for the sake of his
sweetheart, and of the selfish mo—
lives which activate his elder
brother when he destroys a suicide
note which would havo saved the
life of an innocent man. The play
stars Mary Studebaker and Hal
Ashwot‘th, Juniors, as the young
man and his sweetheart, and Art
Soderlind, also a junior, portrays
the elder brother who is "within
an ace of u judgeship."

The second play directed by
Trece Aney, '44, is a Russian com—
edy-romance, featuring Paul Bar-
sclou and Lois I‘lampel, with Robert
Loucks, Juniors.

The set designs were done by
Miss Vivian Hopkins, Instructor in
English, in collaboration with the
student directors; the sets were
erected by Miss Hopkins with the aid
of her stagecraft class.

Freshmen, Yerdanl  impatient,
Tap Themselves for Myskanio

By Jane Heath

My salad days,
When I was green in judgment.
"TSHAKESPEANE.

He did some soliciting, the
Sophomore who went to the Com-
mons on Activities Day. No samples
did he have to show the anxious
frosh; no table room could he beg
from the committee in charge of
arrangements. Nothing did he have
but a convincing line, a pencil and
a sheet of paper.

“You’ve seen them, freshmen, the
eleven most important, most re-
spected, most, shall we say, intelli-‘
gent members of the student body."
He ranted on, praising~the eleven,
urging the freshmen to “gather
around and sign up for Myskaniai"

Three wide-eyed youngsters lis—
tened. One swallowed hard and
whispered, “Got a pencil?” The
others became enthusiastic and Don
Kircher, Jean Ferris, and Sylvia
Proper wrote their names, added an
imposing “‘46.”

Clara Skavina tugged at the
speaker’s coat sleeve and asked,
“Really, can we become members
so soon?"

“Yes, Ma’m," he assured her,
shoving the paper and pencil in
her direction.

Down went eight more names:
Eileen Moody, Patricia Dunn, Helen
Eurczak, Winnie Lulkoski, Marie
Liebl, Arlene Skinner, Gloria Mc-
Ferran, and Eleanor Smith.

Art Russell demanded, “Give me
proof!”

Sophs, Frosh Wailing—-
Bonner Hunt Is NO More

It’s the night for Banner rival-
ryl There’s a gang of Frosh and
Sophs in the far corner of the
“Fresh Roost", (balcony to some
of us). . . .

“Soph-o—mores!” comes a long"
drawn-out yell. . .“Sophomoresl”

That Was last year. This year?
Well—there’s a war going on.
There are blackouts, air raid alerts
and though the Sophs can take
all that, Myskania isn’t very sure
about ’46, so—o-o, for 21/2 of' the
rivalry points, the working ma-
jority (ferns to you) will play
a hot ﬁeld hockey game. As for
the rest of the 10 points, Myskania
hopes to announce them before
Campus Day.

word to the wise, Frosh
“Watch ’45, they're really super!"
And, Sophs--—vice-vcrsal

 

Commission Lists
Rules, Regulations

III an effort to keep the College
buildings in good appearance and in
a cleanly condition, the Student
Council has appointed a nine-mem-
ber group directed by Harold Ash—
on'th, '44, to the 1941—1942 Campus
Commission.

Taking immediate action, the
group presented the following rules
with the reservation that “penal-
ties have no place in an intelligent
student body:"

(1) Smoking shall be permitted
only in the Commons, Publications
Oflice, or Cafeteria, not in the An—
nex area.

(a) Cigarette butts should be
placed only in provided receptacles.

(2) All waste materials shall be
placed in refuse containers.

(3) All eating shall be limited to
the Annex and Cafeteria areas.

(4) All notes in student mail—
boxes that are not at least 2 x 4
inches in size and dated on the
outside will be removed.

(5) All posters not approved by
Campus Commission before being,l
posted shall be removod.

(a) Posters to be approved should
be left in Publications‘ Ollice on
desk behind door. Regulations
governing poster placement are
posted in the I). 0.

(ti) Campus Commission may be
contacted through its ollicial mail—
box.

Assisting Ashworth are: Kit
Ilerdman, Elaine Gt'ogtm, Jane
Soulhwick, Bert Kiley, Ruth Hines,
Nora Giavelli, J. Michael Hipplck,
and Joseph Tossoni.

 

The Sophomore, taking. Russell
into his confidence, pointed to a
Senior and said, ‘.‘See her? Well,
she signed up foui‘ years' ago. Just
watch her sporther cap and gown
at next Friday’s assembly."

And another name was added to
the list.

That made thirteem Didn’t the
Freshman Handbook say that not
more than thirteen Myskania mem—
bers were chosen annually? The
freshmen weren’t to be fooled—oh
no, not they. So they left and
wandered over to the tables.

ButShirley Ford, willing to take
a chance, returned. Not satisﬁed
with her role of class marshal], the
greedy girl signed up with the ex—
pectation that someone might drop
out. Betty Williams became No. .15
on the list, and Bradley ScrafTord,
third boy to add his name, was the
last embryonic Myskania-ite.

He collected names for an hour
and a half, the Sophomore who
went to the Commons. Then he
spent another hour and a half
chuckling to himself.

William Pawlucki, who didn’t see
the solicitor, thought he'd missed
his opportunity. But when he went
home to Sayles Hall lamenting,
some helpful upperclassmen told
him they might “arrange it, but
it'll probably cost you ‘hush money.”

Three days later, the denials of
freshman verdancy came from Kir-
cher and Russell who claimed they
did it “just for fun.” To which
the soliciting Sophomore replied,
“Oh, yeah!"

Re: SEB Assistant Director

Dr. John M. Sayles, President of
the College, has announced that Miss
Doris Kelly will fill the vacancy left

Prepare Program;    .

Orchestra to Continue-
Under Snow’s Direction

College musicians and vocalists
are already tuning up in preparation
for their annual presentations which
will comprise a major part of the
college activities program this year.
One organization will be missing,
however,—-the State College Band.
Last. year’s leader, Charles Reynolds,
’42, is no longer here and, as yet, no
one has risen to replace him. The

orchestra is continuing under the.

direction of Earle Snow, ’43. Bernard
Pgrlman, ’42, last year’s conductor
and founder of the State Symphony,
has recently been inducted into the
armed forces. The draft has taken
a number of Inale vocalists from the
college also, but the Choral and
Operatic Societies are still function-
ing under the direction of Dr. T. F.

H. Candlyn, Assistant Professor of'

Music. ,

The Chorus and Orchestra will
give a joint concert in January.
Choral groups, this year entirely
composed of women’s voices, are
now blending English and Russian
folk tunes sung in three and four
part harmony. - '

The Operatic Society, meanwhile,
has been practicing the airs of Gil—
bert and Sullivan’s “Gondoliers.”
About twenty male voices, surpris-
ingly enough, are included .in the
cast. The date for the ﬁnal’perfor-
manee will probably be, late in
April.

Mr. Snow repeats that the orches-
tra is open to anyone who is inter-
ested, especially freshmen. They

are invited to attend next week’s

rehearsal.

conducted Tuesday afternoon, in

week, at the same time and place,
