Football Race Clone
‘Football is only one week old
here at State, but, after a glimpse
of all eight squads in action, we
ﬁnd that no- one team is outstanding.
There is no squad which outclasses
all other loop members as was
the case in past years. Potter
Club, last year’s champions, was the
class of the league then. They
were hard pressed in only a few
gaines to go undefeated for the
season. The same can be said of
KDRin previous campaigns. .
The 1942 race, however, promises
to be as close a ﬁght for the cham-
pionship as the recent St. 'LOUIS-
Brooklyn pennant chase in the
National League. ’
According to last weeks play
Potter Club and Dorm “A” (Tro-
jans) appear as strong contenders
for the Intramural Cup. Potter
Club has a flock of good experienced
players and are tops defensively.
They have a well balanced squad,
but they seem deﬁcient in some-
thing just as important—and that
is spirit. (Remember the World
Series?). Perhaps the 6-6 tie with
KDR last week.has aroused the
Potter lads from their lethargy.

Trojans Heavy

The Trojans have weight to their
distinct advantage and so far they
have put it to good use. They have
good running and blocking, al-
though they are weak on the pas—
sing. 'It will be quite a battle when
the Trojans meet Potter Club and

e winner of this contest will
have a lot to say about the cham-
pionship.

KDR, with their new shift, is
the dark horse of the league. Their
chief worry is material as there
are no capable substitutes to re-
place the starting six. Kappa Beta
and SLS will be battling it out
for the other ﬁrst division spot.
KB looks very weak on the offense
being able to connect with only
short passes, while missing pitifully
on running and long passes. SLS
has a fairly good attack but is
charged with some loose playing.
Both teams are only average on the
defense.

Dorm “B”, the Finks, and the
Ramblers are the three weak sis-
ters of the league. All three squads
lack experienced players. However,
they are pushovers for no team
in the league as they are ﬁghting
all the time and may cause upsets.

As a surprise to many was the
play of the Finks. Rated as hope—
lessly out-classed, they have put up
good battles before bowing to de-
feat in their two contests so far.
Incidently, the longest run of the
campaign was made by a Fink, Art
Olivet, when he scampered the
length of the ﬁeld to a touchdown
in the KB game.

Rule Changes

A few changes have been made
on the rules governing the Intra-
mural League. A play is stopped
when an opposing player touches
the ball carrier simultaneously with
two hands any place on the back,
above the legs and below the
shoulders. The other change is
that in order to stop the ball car-
rier, the opponents must touch him
in the designated space and not
push or block him out of bounds.
Penalty for breaking this last rule
is a ﬁrst down for the offensive
team at the point of‘the infraction.

1‘ t

This week we would like to pay
tribute to a first class frosh—a man
sporting the name of Dan Gillan.
Dan plays football with the Dorm
“B” squad. He is not an outstanding
star, but only an average player»

of he receivas our vote as the
moat spirited dplayer that we have
been privilege to see.

When a youth, he was a victim of
infantile paralysis, which caused the
shortening of his left leg by a few
inches. However, despite this
handicap Dan is very active in
sports. Besides football, he plays
basketball and softball and is a
very enthusiastic bowler. If this
is the symbol of the spirit that
l the chm of '46, the Sopho-
mom had better beware.

Week in? Attack;
Strong In Defense

Trojans Are Undefeated
To Take League Lead

By Stan Glpp

The intramural touch football
league opened on schedule and all
games have been played as planned.
The games were featured by weak
offensives, strong defenses, and low
scores.

At the present, Dorm “A”, pop-
ularly known as the Trojans, pos-
sess a top position in the league by
virtue of two wins without a loss.
Several others have not yet been
defeated but rank below the Tro-
jans in points on a two for a win,
one for a tie basis.

In Thursday’s openers, the feature
game between KDR and EEP ended
in a 6-6 stalemate. The excellent
pass defense thrown up by KDR
and Potter’s weak defensive resulted
in this early upset. Bob Leonard
intercepted a pass to score for KDR
from twenty-ﬁve yards out. For
three quarters EEP fought desper—
ately, finally scoring as Evans hurd-
led center. Both teams failed to
score the extra point.

Trojans Top Ramblers

The Trojans defeated the Ramb-
lers 14-0 in a one—sided contest
on the other gridiron. Although
they failed to capitilize on the
breaks the Dorm boys had by far
the better team.

On Tuesday Kappa Beta was
forced to the limit to defeat the
Finks in what was supposed to
have been a breather. KB recov-
ered a fumbled punt and scored
immediately. The surprisingly fast
Finks tied up the game on a goal
to goal run by Olivet, with the
aid of some beautiful down-ﬁeld
blocking by Carpenter. This game

also had all the appearances of an
upset tie until the last quarter,
when KB scored a safety and then
clinched the game on a touchdown
pass to Art Flax.

SLS defeated the inexperienced
Shieks, Dorm "B", by a twelve to
nothing score. However, the score
would have been much more de-
cisive were it not for frequent
SLS offside and other penalties.
Weight and experience seemed to be
the factor which stopped the Dorm
team despite the efforts of young
Dick Chillemi.

Fatal Fourth

Again on Tuesday the Finks pro-
duced the major attraction although
they again lost in the last quarter.
The heavy Trojan team was held to
a safety until the last quarter when
the smart quarterbacking of captain
Fay Weleh, the elusive running of
Joe Tassoni, and the huge frame
of Mike Ganakus set up two touch-
downs.

KDR won their ﬁrst contest on
Tuesday, defeating the Ramblers
19-6. There was no doubt about
the victor at any point in the game,
although Max Braun of the Ramb-
lers worried KDR considerably.
Leonard and Beyer, received nu—
merous Verrey passes for both long
gains and touchdowns.

If the scores and play of these
first games are at all indicative of
the future games, the championship
will be well-earned and the champ-
ions well—named.

LATE SCORES

Yesterday afternoon the Kappa
Beta team downed the SL5 aggrega-
tion by a score of 14—7. The winners
took an early lead by scoring two
touchdowns on passes in the ﬁrst
half. SLS rallied in the final quar-
ter and tallied on an intercepted
pass-Dave Grifiin going over the
goal line.

In the other game Potter Club ran
and passed at will to score on easy
38-0 victory over an outclassed but
ﬁghting Dorm "8" team.

WAA Program
Hits Full Stride

Hockey, Swimming
Archery, Riding Popular

WAA hockey days have been
changed to Tuesday, Wednesday and
Friday. So few people reported for
practice on Monday that the change
had to be made. Games are played
at 3:30 in front of Page Hall on the
above days. Ten hours of super—
vised play are necessary for credit.
Many girls are out for this sport and
at each session new teams are
chosen. Due to transportation dif-
ﬁculties, it is rumored that there will
be no hockey conferences this year.

Swimming, under the captaincy of
Pat Latimer, will start soon at Pub-
lic Bath No. 3 on Thursday nights.
As usual, the time will be 7:30 and
the cost will be ten cents. Last
summer Pat was sent by WAA to
a school where she received her
Red Cross Lifesaving Certiﬁcate
and will teach Life-Saving this year.
Mary Sanderson will have charge of
the regular swimming. It is hoped
that many girls will take advantage
of this opportunity to learn lifesav-
mg.

Mondays, Wednesdays and Fri-
days at 3:30 Betty Clough and Helen
Bushnell are in command of archery.

The fall season ends at Thanks-
giving. All those desiring credit in
a fall sport must have their hours
completed by then.

Frosh Tennis Tourney
Proceeding Slowly

Another week has passed and still
the Fresh tennis tournament has
failed to start rolling. All ﬁrst
round matches were scheduled to be
played by Monday, September 28;
second round matches by Thursday,
October lst; third round matches by
Saturday, October 3rd; and the ﬁnals
were to have been played Tuesday,
October 6th.

As yet, only four matches have
been played. Walt Block defeated
Les deWeerdt, Mark Blunt topped
Block 7-5, 4-6, 8-6; Dick Chillemi
bested Irv Finger 6-2, (3-0, and Bob
F‘erbcr beat Luzer 6-0, (3-1.

Harry Kensky, director of the
tournament, is deﬁnitely disap—
pointed in the progress so far. He
urges all players to get in touch with
their opponents and arrange to play
off their matches.

Tennis Tourney.
Matches to Begin

Plans for the WAA tennis tourney
have been completed. Fifteen girls
have entered the contest. SeVen
matches are scheduled for the ﬁrst
round. These must be played and
the results must be submitted to the
captains, Giavelli and Domann, be-
fore October 14. Not a single match
has been played yet due in part to
the inclement weather which has
kept the Washington Park courts
in a boggy condition.

The two contests of major interest
in the ﬁrst round are those between
Nora Giavelli and Helen Hennessy,
and Flo Garfall and Kay Devine.
The winners of these two matches
play each other in the second round.
Thus, if both Nora and F10 win their
games, the two ﬁnalists of last
year’s tourney will again meet.

The ﬁfteen girls who are playing
in the tourney are Pat Latimer,
Joan Smith, Mary Domann, Nora
Giavelli, Eileen Shoup, Helen Hen-
nessy, Flo Garfall, Kay Devine,
Dotty Huyck, Leah Tischler, Arline
Polsky, Winifred Luikoski, Sunna
Cooper, Josephine Simon and Alma
Beckerle.

Domann and Giavelli are hoping
for fair weather so that the tourna-
ment may be completed before the
park courts are closed for the sea-
son. All contestants should play
their matches as rapidly as possible.

Freshmen Squad
TO Start Practice

Coach G. E. Hatﬁeld has issued
ﬁrst call for all frosh interested in
playing intercollegiate basketball
this season. Preliminary training is
to begin early next week. Coach
Hatﬁeld is calling out the frosh
earlier than the upperclassmen in
order to get some idea of the
quantity and quality of the basket-
ball material contained in the fresh-
man class. The frosh are especially
important this year as they are
eligible for positions on the varsity.

The entire basketball set-up at
State, as has been previously an-
nounced is to be changed this year.
Instead of a Varsity-Fresh arange-
ment as of former years, a Varsity-
Junior Varsity system is to be em-
ployed.

All frosh interested are urged
to attend the ﬁrst meetings. High
school experience, while helpful, is
not essential. Nothing very strenu-
ous is planned for the ﬁrst few days.
Calisthenics and general loosening
up of the frosh is to be the first
activity. In this Coach Hatﬁeld is
to be helped by student assistant
coaches.

The schedule of the J. V. team
has not yet been announced, but is
expected to follow more or less
closely that of last year's frosh
team.

Class Nominations

ln Orientation

Election Day to Be
Oct. 26 in Commons

Nominations for officers of the
Class of ’46 were held last Monday
during the weekly Orientation meet—
ing. F‘ivc men and four Women were
nominated for the Presidency.

In the last two years in spite of
their fewer numbers, there have
been a majority of men entering the
presidential campaign. The women,
however, wary of male domination,
have successfully pooled their votes
to elect women presidents. Pat Car-
roll was elected Frosh President for
’44 by a slim margin, the first femin—
ine executive in ten years. The
Class of '45 elected Flo Garfall in the
first rcvotc by an overwhelming
majority.

According to the annual custom,
voting for Freshman officers will be
held in the Commons by secret bal-
lot, with Myskania supervising. The
date set is October 26, before which
every candidate and voter must have
paid his class dues.

Nominations can still be made by
contacting any member of Myskania.
When the News went to press, the
following candidates had been nonr
mated:

President: Stanley Abrams, Rich-
ard Chelleni, Jean Ferris, Beth Har-
per, Donald Kirchcr, Robert Merritt,
Sylvia Propper, Lynn Wolff, and

Doran who was originally elected
to that position but left school.

For the Sophomores, Nora
Crumm defeated Gordon Baskin
