K 5': Passing

The most important development
in the football league during the
past'week has been the rise of the
Kappa Beta team from just another
league member to a contenderfor
the championship.

The reason for KB’s fast climbing
upwards in the league race is their
deft passing attack. Using short fiat
passes, in most cases, KB has had
amazing success by the aerial route.
With Joe Levin doing most of the
pitching and any of the other five
players receiving, these boys have
been able to combine accuracy with
deception to complete at least 70"»f.
of their ﬂat passes. It will take more
than some carefully laidout plans to
stop their short passes. So far the
Finks, SLS, and KDR have failed.

The running form of Sol‘Stolbof
in this week’s contests has strength-
ened the title hopes of KB, who as
yet have not shown much of a
ground attack.

Rule Change

Intramural Council has found it
necessary to amend one of the foot—
ball rules. The new rule reads that
if a player of the defensive team
tackles the ball carrier, the defensive
. . .. u; ,c‘ii.li ed ten yards
from the point of infraction and the
offensive team will be awarded a
ﬁrst down.

As the rule stood before this week,
only a ﬁrst down was awarded to
the offensive team. However, in a
number of instances ball carriers
have been tackled after they had
ran the ball for a first down. In
this way the offenders had been able
to escape penalty as the referee had
no alternative. It was a wise and
just move to make, even though the
season’s schedule is about half com~
pleted.

ill 1! ill

The fresh tennis tournament is
progressing very slowly this year.
Individual contestants are not play—
ing their matches on schedule. We
have been fortunate this fall to be
favored with playing weather. How-
ever, this may not continue.

What do you say, frosh'.‘ How
about doing something about it‘.’

III ’II ll!

Basketball has already found its
way into State College as frosh bas-
ketcers answered the call this week
for practice in preparation for the
coming season. Only a few have re—
ported as yet. However, more are
expected next week when practice
sessions will be held every afternoon,
Friday excepted. It is too early,
though, at this stage to make any
predictions as to possible hoopster
material contained in the class of '40.

Frosh Net Tourney
Nearing Completion

The it’i'osli tournament has appar-
ently been aroused from its lclluirgy.
More matches were played last week
than in ill! the preceding weeks of
the tourney.

Rob Ferber, who deft-tiled llai'i'y
Lazcr, 6-0. 6-1, to gain the second
round, trounced Jim l'lowm'th on
Tuesday by n score of 0—2, 6-0. This
victory advances Harbor to the filial
round. llowarth gained the second
round by virtue of it (lcl'iiull from
Jim lliirder. In the other match.
Bob Merritt, after a slow start, won
over Jim Miners by it scorc of Il-li,
6-1, 8-0.

Mark liluut and Dick Chillcni
must lllt't'i to determine who shall
play in the send-finals. The winner
of the Mart liortnick-Murph Paul
match will vic with Bob Merritt to
fill in the other senil-lliinl bracket.
As yet, neither Bortnick or Paul
have played a mulch.

Harry Keiisky, chairman of the
tourney, was well pleased with this
week's play. and is very hopeful of
having the finals played within the
coming Week.

 Dorm  Ties  For Lead”

Disputed Game Ends 6-6
Potter Club Scores 7-6 Over SLS in Tight Battle,

KDR and SLS Removed from Undefeated Ranks
While the Finks Win by Defeating the Ramblers

by John Sussina

‘Scoring on “borrowed” time on
the last play of the game, Dorm
“A” tied KB 6-6 yesterday after-
noon, and moved into a tie with
the latter for the league lead.
On the play, which KB declares
would not have occured if time
had not been stopped, Welch ship—
ped a short pass to Cummings
down the middle.

KB’s score came early in the
first quarter as a result of a short
pass from Levin to Art Flax.

In the other game, a ﬁghting
Rambler squad held a powerful
SLS sextet even for three quarters,
and then proceeded to toss the game
away when Caple blocked a kick.
The passing combination of Hippick
to Guarino clicked from ﬁve yards
out for the score.

Maintaining its pace of at least
two touchdowns per game, a beauti—
fully passing KB team downed SLS
by 14-7, and KDR by 19—0. A 20-
yard pass by Joe Levin to Art Flax
scored the ﬁrst touchdown against
SLS in the first quarter, and another
pass, this thrown by L. Flax, set the
stage for a 15—yard romp to pay-dirt
by Stolbof in the second quarter.
Both extra points were made good
on passes from Levin to A. Flax.

In the third period SLS roared
back to within striking distance of a
tie or victory on the wings of an in—
...i'ce,.tcd pass and run by Dave
Uriflin from mid-field. However, the
entire fourth quarter was played
around the mid-ﬁeld stripe, where
the ﬁnal play ended.

Holding unbeaten KDR to only
one first down, and moving ahead on
sharp Stolbof passes, KB scored once
in the second period and twice in the
last quarter, the last touchdown
coming on a pass interception and
run covering the length of the field
by Stolbof, to conquer KDR, 19-0.
Levin clicked with A. Flax with ii
five-yard bullet pass for the touch—
down in the first quarter, and Leo
Flax ran over from the three after
two pass plays had failed for the
second score. Stolbof’s interception
was the last play of the game.
Dorm Beats Dorm

Dorm "A" kept its slate clean and
its goal—line still uncrossed as it
mowed down Dorm "B" by iii-0.
Both teams took to the air early but
the first score came in the second
period as ’l‘assoni flipped to Cum—
iniiigs on the very first play of the
quarter. Half—way through the same
period 'l‘assoni again connected, this
time with Sinythe, for another six--
pointer. The third quarter was a
nightmare of interceptions, six of
the ten in the game coming then.
Play was concentrated around mid—
field. The fiiinl period was a few
minutes old when 'l‘iissoni, behind
cxccllenl blocking scored on a run
from mid—field. Dorm "A" was again
threatening at the final gun.

Hansen, and Kullman catching, Pot-
ter scored at will.

In its second game this week, Pot-
ter had a rougher time of it, barely
nosing out SLS, 7-6. Its offense
completely stymied most of the af—
ternoon, and shoved back on its
heels by inspired SLS team, Pot-
ter depended on the right arm of
“Red” Evans for its touchdown and
also for the winning extra point.
Midway in the second quarter, Hip~
pick, a good back all afternoon,
flipped a flat pass to Guarino who
out—raced the Potter secondary to
the goal line. The run for the extra
point was halted and SLS led at
half—time, 6—0.

Potter Scores

Three plays after the second half
started, Evans faded to mid-field
and threw to Sussina running along
the right sideline, connecting with
the latter just as he crossed the goal
line. In the all—important extra-
poiiit try, Evans shot a sharp flat
pass to Lynch in the right corner of
the end-zone, putting Potter ahead,
7-6. SLS moved to Potter’s six-
yard line in the third quarter, and,
aided by Hippick’s 40-yard return
of a punt, marched to the Potter
three in the fourth. Both times EEP
field for downs and took possession
of the ball.

Capitalizing on a blocked kick in
the final quarter, the speedy Finks,
formerly known as the Thomas
Moore boys, scored a touchdown five
seconds from the end of the game to
down the hard—fighting, now thrice~
beaten Ramblers, 12-6. Starting with
a thirty-yard run by “Red” O’Leary
shortly after the start of the second
half, the Finks, aided by a fifteen-
yard holding penalty, moved to the
Rambler six-yard line, from which
point Olivet threw to Schumacker
for the score. The pass for the point
was batted to the ground.

Finks Score

Three plays after the return kick-
off, Max Braun, Rambler, run to his
right and threw to Ray Howard
running all alone down the left side-
line. Howard gathered it in on the
20 and sped across untouched. A
run for the extra point was stopped,
and the score remained 6—6. There-
after, though the Finks threatened,
they could not score until the closing
seconds. Having taken a Fink punt
on their own six the Ramblers tried
three plays which lost a few yards.
The fourth-down kick by Braun was
blocked by Jim Dunning and the
Finks took over on the Rambler
three. On the second play Olivet
rifled a pass down the middle to
Dunning for the winning score. The
extra point try failed and the game
ended on the next kick—oil.

’45, '46 Begin
Rivalry Games,-
Pusliball Today

by John Dooley

The hour for great men has ar-
rived at last!

On to the ﬁeld of spirited battle
the proud members of the freshman
and sophomore will march to uphold
the honor of their classes, each
striving, each straining to make his
an effort long remembered.

As both sides go to the pole to
await the opening gun an evil and
desperate look is found in many an
eye. To your right you can see a
solid “Crimson Tide,” bent on
avenging last year’s showing and
keeping the present group of green-
horns in the old corral. On the left
is a formation of' “Blue Devils,” in~
experienced, yet game and always
fighting—as the underdog does-—
with everything to win and nothing
to lose.

The men of the two classes will
open the program this afternoon at
4:30 on Page Field, when they line
up their choice “bone-ci'ushers” for
a mauling game of pushball. Buck
Hippick, captain of the ’45’ers, pre-
dicted a clean and eflicient sweep of
rivalry and said, “We’ll start the
bandwagon rolling in pushball.” Op-
posing his charges will be Marty
Bortnick and his “rambling amblers"
who have plenty in weight and
brawn, but lack in the “know—how”
department. As a matter of policy.
a special section will be set aside for
visiting med students and eager
first-aiders so that they may get into
action soon after the opening whistle.

The "Crimson Tide" will plan to
continue their feud at 3:30 when
“Smiling” John Sussina's six-man
cleanup squad roars into high gear
against Dick Chilleni's "men of the
year" in touch football. From the
opening kick-off to the final play
this game promises to be one of the
best, with new formations and
razzle-dazzle ball handling promised
by both sides. The soph captain de-
clared his stand in these words—
“One of our boys bet we’d win by 5
touchdowns and we’re not letting
him down." The freshmen have
adopted the motto “Our gang will
write their history as they march!"

The women’s obstacle races will
follow this event. “Ginger” Shoup
will lend the fresh to the white line
and Nora Giiivellintate’s choice for
the role of Tiii'zan's mute, will set the
pace for the soph team.

in the evening both classes will
conclude their efforts with skits and
new corn will be cut from the old
cob while the “actors” laugh and the
audience groans.

Girl's Tennis Tourney
Completes initial Round

The WAA tennis tournament has
finally gotten under way. Six
matches have been played in the
first round. Liitimer defeated Smith,
6-], 0-2: Simon was victorious over
Cooper, 0—2, 6—0; Gurf’all beat Dc-
vinc, 0-2, 0—1; Lulkoski was dc—
l'ciited by Polski, 6—], 6—1; Giavelli
won over lIeniicssey, 3—2, 6—2, 6—3;
Schoiip bcal Doninim; Bcckcrlc drew
ii bye.

in the one iiiiilcli of the second
round, (lichlli triumphed ovcr
licckcrlc, 0-0, 6—0. Giavelli is
therefore, the only tillt' to be ready
for hcr third match. She Would
have played (ini‘l'nll tll this stage,
but to make lllt' lt)lll'lltlllil,‘lll more
interesting, the players llil\'t‘ been
switched.

Now that these iiiiitclics are over.
it is hoped that the tournament will
be played ofl’ soon.

A stitch in time saves nine is an
old proverb. We’ve a feeling that
apologies are going to be due from
us in a week or so. This being the
case, we might as well make them
now. Two weeks ago, we spoke
some bitter words about the slow
starting of the WAA tennis tourney.
“Never will it be finished, cold
weather will come and the tourney
will remain uncompleted.” We don’t
for a moment imagine that either
Nora Giavelli or Mary Domann,
captains, worried or lost any sleep
because of our gloomy prediction.
But they’re doing a ﬁne job with the
tournament now. Unless the snow
comes long before schedule, the
tournament should be completed and
the trophy presented to the winner
again this year. It is too early to
predict the victor but Flo Garfall
and Nora Giavelli, finalists last year,
have both won their first matches.
Sport of the Week

In accordance with our promise
of giving you the inside information
on a different sport each week, we
now discuss the strenuous sport of
hockey. There’s only one way to
really know a sport and that is to
play it. It was a cold day and damp,
one of those days when it’s more fun
to think about sports than to play
them, so we sent the two sophomore
members of the woman's sports staff
out to discover what it’s like to play
hockey. But they were weak, not
made of the stern stuff that. sent the
senior members out to climb on
horses and gallop through the wood—
land pntlis of The Ranch. 'They
went, they saw, and they did not
play. "Gosh," said on, “they all had
sticks! It looked rough, the other
agreed, very rough. We decided we
were more valuable as writers with-
out broken arms. So we sat on the
sidelines and watched. It looked like
fun and no one was hurt, at least not
permanently. And they certainly
did look healthy.” So now you
know what we know about hockey.
Kit I-lerdman says that it’s a grand
game. And who are we to disagree?
Play hockey Mondays, Wednesdays
and Thursdays ill 3:30 on the Dorm
field.

Camping Out

New to the frosh—but dear to the
hearts of many upperclassmen--~-is
WAA's Camp Johnston located in
the Chatham hills. Do you like to
\VL‘ftl‘ old clothes, go for long hikes
in the open country and eat delicious
food? All these pleasures and many
others cnii be enjoyed any week—end
at the camp. No men will be there
-r~just peace and quiet and long
talks before n blazing fire. If you're
not the athletic type, you can spend
the time in a comfortable hunk with
a good book, watching your more
hardy friends wear themselves out
on long hikes. Camp life is fun so
notice of a week-end. Or gather
watch the WAA bulletin board for
together six of your pals and tell
Win Jones that you'd like to visit
the camp.

Students Register
For War Work

First Aid and Air Raid
Courses Most in Demand

According to a report of the War
Activities Council, more than 60
per cent of the students enrolled
have volunteered to aid in the war
effort. To date 531 students have
signed up.

Of the 27 activities offered, the
Elementary First Aid course re-
ceived the most entrants, a total
number of 141. The Advanced First
Aid Class will be conducted for 35

houses and college buildings are re-
quired to take this course. Another
air raid course emphasizing com-
munity problems received only 15
registrants.

Eighty-six women signed up to
knit and to act as knitting instruc-
tors. Another handiwork service,
sewing, received 54 women appli-
cants. Besides making garments for
the Red Cross, students who sign up
for sewing may use the course as a
"make over” lab [or old clothes.
This feature has been added in an
effort to encourage conservation of
material. Katherine Cousins, ’43, is
in charge of this activity; a co—ehair—
man will be selected at a later date.

Typing and ofﬁce work registra-
tion totals 79 and 65, respectively.
Students who signed up for office
work helped during the week in or-
ganizing and ﬁling the volunteers'
cards.

Only four men signed up to act
as hospital orderlies, while 74
women enrolled as nurses' assistants.
These services offer minimum wages
of 30 cents per hour. Forty-five
women have begun this activity in
Albany Hospital.

Campus Chest
Will Start Drive

An appeal is being made to State
College students for generous con-
tributions to Campus Chest. The
drive will last from November 2 un—
til Armistiec Day, November 1!.
Each student is expected to give at
least fifty cents because they will not
be approached at any other time
during the year.

The contributions from the cur-
rent campaign will be divided
among the Red Cross, World Stit—
dcnt Service Fund, USO, Naval Rc—
licf, and tuberculosis and paralysis
funds. The fifty dollars pledged to
the NEWS is iilrciidy being used to
send the paper to undergraduates
and graduates now in the armed
forces. I

So! Grecnberg, ’43, Chairman of
the Campus Chest Committee, said,
"We hope that every student will
contribute as generously as possible
because of tlic (lccrcased enrollment
and the prcscnt urgcnt situation.”
Last year the committee collected
four hundred dollars. It is hoped
that this year’s drive will not as
much or more because of the added
needs.

Volunteers are needed to solicit
every student. Any Sophomore or
Junior who desires to help the com—
mittee should see Greenberg some-
time this afternoon.

The silence in the auditorium was
profound and unusual. Then the
lights grew dim and the two Sopho-
more pages, Lucillc Still and Lois
Drury, appeared on the stage. They
sounded their trumpets and the 1943
Campus Queen entered to the
strains of Pump and Circumstance.
The suspense of the past weeks
ended when it was found that Mil—

As for rivalry, the fresh look over
the Class of ’45 by the score of lS—(i,
in pnshball. it’s the first iinic in
ycnrs that the froin won the first
pushball game; even the mighty
Class of "ill didn’t do that.

But then came the football game
and the Sopbs came out on top to
avenge tlicinsclVes Willi a score of
27-6. What it game! The Sophs
had both Bl‘tlllll and brains. added to
Sussina and Gipp why lhc coin-
biniillon set-med iiiibciifnblc, to the
freshmen anyhow. 'l’licrc were a
great many pcniiltlcs against the
Sophs, bill the passing and blocking
of the "Ci‘iiiison Tide" ovci'ciiiiic
these disadvantages. Oh yes, before
we forget, that soinci'snult of Joe
'l‘nssoni’s was ill] cxnnipli- of how
for the Sophs will go to win rivalry
this your.

insofar as Ciuiipus Day goes, the
Sophs are ahead by one point. There
are still many points left. The
“Crimson Tide” fully expects to
come out on top, but the “Blue
Devils" have shown a lot more
spirit llnm ’45, and spirit is what
"brings home the bacon.” So go to
it all of you, and the best class will
surely win!

Sororities Plan

Parties, Tomorrow

Four Classes Participate,-
Two Bands to Entertain

Tonight will usher in a tem
intellectual blackout as State (STREET;
goes glamorous in honor of the All-
State hop. Two orchestras have
beenengaged from 9 P. M. to 1 A.
M. to sound out the mood for the
evening’s gala festivities. The bands
are those of Joe Metzger, who
played recently at Siena, and Charlie
Rendall, well~known to all State
College swing fans. The bands will
feature two vocalists.

A large crowd is anticipated to
add color to State’s first big social
event. Everyone from the lowliest
fresh to the grand old seniors will
be there, for this is a four-class
dance, intended for every State stu-
dent.‘ The All-State was an innova—
tion introduced last year to replace
the fall Senior dance. It was a suc-
cess both socially and ﬁnancially.
War Economy Evident

Sayles and Pierce Halls have been
chosen as the home grounds for the
dance. In the interests of economy
for national defense, class banners
will be used for decorative purposes
instead of the customary more com-
plicated entanglements.

With economy as a keynote, bids
have been placed at the low price of
$1.65, a price no one can take excep-
tion. to especially since the dance is
semi-formal and tuxedos do not
comprise a problem.

The chaperones are: Dr. and Mrs.

C. Jones, Dr. and Mrs. D. V.
Smith, Dr. and Mrs. R. G. Clausen,
and Mr. and Mrs. James Gemmel.
