Re-Open Sesame-—

No one can deny that probably the tnost im-
portant unit of any college or university is its
library. State College is no exception to the
rule; the library plays a tremendous role in our
educational process.

It can, howcvcr, be said that a library whose
doors are closed is of no value at all. Such is
the inescapable fact with which the student body
of the collegc is faced.

From 5:30 P. M. until 8 A. M. the use of the
library is prohibited to all. The reason for this,
as has so often been stated through the columns
of the News, is that the cost of blacking out the
library is great and that its glass ceiling makes
it unsafe in case of a bombing attack.

But Albany High School, whose building is
located on the same block as the buildings of the
college, remains brightly lightcd nearly every
cvcnii'ig oi the week. It is hereby demonstrated
that it is not Iicccssary to black out public build-
ings at all. Although it is truc, that in thc casc
of an alcrt. all Work would have to cease in the
library, thc infrcqucncy of blackouts docs not
warrant thc cxpcnditurc of large sums of money
to providc blackout curtains. If the ofﬁce build-
ings of thc State of New York can remain lighth
throughout the early evening, so can ours.

Concerning thc dangcrs bcsctting those in lhc
library bccatisc of the glass ceiling, they can bc
cliniinatcd by a removal of thc pcoplc prcscnt to
a saicr placc, c.g. tlic lowcr corridor of Drapcr,
as was donc last year. This procedure would, of
coursc, (all for tho opctiiiig of tilt: lockcr rooms

harm is tho-rt: in this?

A lai‘gc portion of tlic student body can do its

Senator Josh Lee (D., Okla.) is
the author of a prohibition amend-
ment to the bill lowering the draft
age from 20 to 18. The amendment
would ban beer and liquor from
Army camps and naval establish-
ments, and from communities adja-
cent to such military centers.

Meanwhile, in the House, which
passed the draft measure last week
without a prohibition amendment,
Majority Leader Representative Mc—
Cormack said, “If the other body
puts on amendments and changes the
character of the bill, of course that
presents a situation that is going to
be difficult to evaluate as to what
our (the House) course of action
will be. But it is my opinion that if
the other body radically or drastic—
ally changes the character of the bill
we sent over, the probability of any
action before election day is re-
mote.”

Secretary Stimson, expressing his
views on the proposed amendment,
said, “It. is my view and that of the
War Department that temperance
among soldiers is obtained by the
application of practical and tolerant
measures . . . rather than from pro—
hibition. Prohibit this and those

who desire such beaerages will in—
evitably resort to the Speakeasy and
bootlegger outside the military
reservation.”

Members of the Senate continued
to voice indecision as to how they
would vote on the proposal, which is
viewed by many as a ﬁrst step in a
drive for country-wide prohibition.
Senators were frank in saying that,
with the election near, the “politi—
cal” vote for the amendment would
be “aye.” Others expressed the be-
lief lhat it would be voted down.

Many New Zealand boys are now
going into military camp from high
school, the National Vocational
Guidance Association revealed in a
report on a survey covering the ﬁrst
seven months of 1942.

The twenty-ﬁrst amendment re-
pealed prohibition, but the blue-nose
pressure groups were far from dead.
Backed by philanthropic trust funds
they bided their time until the day
when they would be able to impose
the era of bootlegging and organized
gangs on the country.

Should the amendment be ac—
cepted it would have to be voted
upon by the House, entailing more
and more delays. .

 

Satirical Squeegies

 

To the Editor:

Sykick, the great prognosticalor,
has come to State. 'l‘ucsday he set
up his little crystal in the rotunda,
ordered a blackout, and proceeded
to reveal to a tolerant and broad-
mlndcd audience—the FUTURE!

Into the mood with Sykick—lhc
lights dim, a haze of smoke eddies
up frotn the crystal. But there is a
smile on Sykick's face as he ogles
into the crystal, for the crystal is
clear. Slowly he begins to intone
his mystic ritual as everyone grows
slightly purple from holding his
breath lost an apoplcclic eruption
break the spell.

"Women of State College, prcparc
yourselves, for your hour of trial is
at hand. The world is locked in a
mighty struggle. 'l‘housands of
young men have a vital part in this
conflict. And, since events will take
their normal course, a certain por-
ccnlagc of those valiant youths will
come from your Alma Mater. Which
means but one thing as far as you
are personally concerned. Oi course
I advocate, war woi'kr—u-il's good for
yoti! But the personal anglcmlliat’s
what I'm interested in helping you
with. (Some guy, Sykick).

“Now within a Very few months
there will be a startling change in
our college life. In place of the
ordes of males that surround you
every waking hour, there will be few
——I might even say that there would
be that appalling thing—a ratio.

This will be a strange experience
for you. But it is definitely coming.
(Deep purple).

“Women of State College, what is
going to be done? You deﬁnitely
have a problem—the crystal says so.
Now of course you will make the
most of your present situation.
Don’t be reluctant—accept every
date that comes your way. Soon Joc
College will 'be only a memory. And
when you are with one of these fu—
ture ltcrocs, keep up his morale.
Don'l object to paying for a couple
of cokcs now and then, but rcmcm—
her, everything in moderation. Don'l
overdo it, though of course, you’re
on your own.

"So much for the present. The
future is in a little difiot‘citl light.
The adjustment will be hard—«from
a constantly ringing lclcphonc to an
apparently disconncclcd one. But
you must substituch Gcl used to
having fctn frolics, inaugurate big
Saturday night licn sessions. Takc
correspondence courses so you will
be well prepared to write letters to
your homes in the service. Enroll
in worthy causes, such as lhc USO,
atid lhc TGIF.

“This is your opportunity to show
your mettle. Fling yourselves into
the teeth of the impending emer-
gcncy and fight, ﬁght, fight. Re—
member, girls, Violet's our color.”
(And then the lights came on, and
there lay Sykick entranced by his
feminine audienCe).

1! Congress passes that prohibition amendment to the
18 & 19 year draft bill, they’re liable to find a. second
from sooner titan tempected . . . The locale—Washing-
ton, D. C . .

War Activities Council, quite perturbed over recent
criticism and a prevalent attitude of vague hostility,
has decided to open its meetings to all students who
may come, offer suggestions, and join in the discussions
as they see ﬁt . . . This should save a lot of criticisms,
as well as time in Assembly. . . .

Meetings, to be held in the inner sanctum of the
Dean of Women, will alternate weekly from 8 A. M.
Thursdays to 4 P. M. Wednesdays . . . While 8 is a
horrible hour, it’s still a step in the right direction. . ..

ELLERIN AND MESCHTER

Pvt. ARNIE ELLERIN sends a graphic description of
his duties at Aberdeen Proving Ground, Maryland . . .
“At the present time I am working in the training sec-
tion of the transportation department—this sounds like
a lot, but all we do is train all drivers of army vehicles
—from kiddie cars on up.”

The popular Varsity basketeer of ’41 adds this en-
vious bit: “This is the garden spot of the army—no
guard duty, no K. P., no detail, no nothing. . . .”

Midshipman AL MESCHTER writes in protest to be—
ing called a wolf—«but it still goes . . . After deleting all
material unﬁt to print, this remains—“I am very much
pleased with my selection of service. I like the sea
life very much, however, I ﬁnd it a very hard life. You
have to be able to take it, as well as well as dish it out."

QUOTES FROM THE OUOTABLE

Here’s what the boys who are doing the job for you
think of in their spare moments:

BILL FORREST—somewhere not in the USA—“I've
seen quite a bit since I left State last December and
it has all helped to make me decide that when this is
all over I shall go back and ﬁnish college . . . If I can
get an education, I intend to do so.

“I’m certainly proud to be out here doing my small
part in this way. I can think of much pleasanter ways
of life, but in order that we may enjoy them we have
to make sure that no one will try to take them away
from us. . . .”

JOHNNY ALDEN, Flying Instructor (acting Ser-
geant) at Camp Luna, New Mexico—“I've got to do a
little housework, Sunday is the maid’s day off—«of
course.

HOWIE ANDERSON—In the land of the Wild Irish
Rose—“I’m going back to complete my education with
eyes that are opened and a mind more critical . . . I
consider a live soldier a good soldier if he didn’t fall
in his job while protecting his life . . . The English
coinage, I’ve tried to consider it without prejudice and
I still think the USA has a simpler & more efﬁcient
system . . . I’m in the pink and d———-— glad to be here
where I can be of value. . . ."

ODDS & ENDS

THAT YOU WON’T FIND IN THE NEWS
COLUMNS—Gel out your Absorbine, Junior—they’re
putting up the commando course . . . paging Colonel
Annie . . . George Kunz wants a copy of the ﬁrst issue
of the News, if you have one bring it to the P. O. . . .
War Activities registration hitting 60"., is deﬁnitely

soon and probably ﬁgured they would be doing enough
. . . Takas’ draft board advised him against going back
to Michigan . . . he takes his prelim Tuesday. . . .

Main reason Forum cancelled the United Nations
dance was that the committee thought there have been
too many conflicts with fraternity activities already this
year—a rush dance was listed for the same night . . .
For our money Dean Nelson & D. V. Smith are doing
the tnosl for the War effort . . . and saying the least
about il, too . . . But that’s the way it ‘usually is. . . .

AYBE YOU PLAN ON BUYING WAR STAMPS
for your date tonight, and maybe you plan on buying
flowers—that is purely a matter the individual must
decide—but whatever you decide be sure you have a
good reason for il, and are not merely trying to climb
on tho bandwagon of social conformity. . . .

Corsages made of war stamps cleverly arranged can
bc bought practically anywhere, and your girl should
be proud to be seen wearing onc,»~bul if flowers arc
to you a definite dz essential part of the dance—well
then, gel flowors . . . After all, it's your dough and
your dame, so we don’t see any reason wlty we crack-
pots should tell you what to do with either one. Just

STATE COLLEGE NEW/willow, OCTOBER 23‘, I'm

 

 

Slate Students Express Views
On CurrentL I'8'I9 Draft Question

 

With the rapid turn of events, the
question of drafting 18 and 19 year
old males is fast becoming a reality.
Never before in the history of our
nation have the people been con-
fronted with quite the same prob-
lem—a problem whose scope in-
cludes every walk of life, whose en—
action will have a most decisive ef-
fect on the war.

The people have voiced their sen-
timents, the newspapers have “pro’d”
and “conned” their views with
vehemence. The next step, the ﬁnal
step lies with Congress. However,
th realization that these are abnor-
mal times will be, without a doubt,
the dominating factor in any and
every decision.

So Stale lakes its stand along side
thousands of other colleges. And
this is what the students of NYSCT
say: Joe Tassoni, ’45, asserts, “It’s
0. K. as far as I’m concerned. I’m
ready if and when.” Stan Gipp, fel-
low classmate, leaves a lot to the
imagination with his mysterious, “It
can’t be printed.”

We get a touch of the paternal
with Paul Barselou, '43, “You see,
I’m not 18 or 19. I’m an old man of
20, but in some respects I think the
new conscription plan is a good
thing. There’ll always be men of
that age, and since this is a young
man's war, start taking them now."
Jane Roolh, ’45, after listening to Mr.
Barselou, hastily disagreed, “No, give
them at least a year of college and a
chance to live."

But the frosh are not to be over—
looked. Among the verdant class of

by Sunnu Cooper

 

’46 is one Bo‘b Wilcox who afﬁrmed,
“I think it’s a good idea. I want to
join the air force; I can’t get my
parents’ consent, and this way, I'd
go regardless. We can’t win without
the young fellows. They’ve always
won a war.”

Peg Bostwick, ’45, gives her an-
swcr thus concisely, “It’s 0. K. as
long as they let college kids ﬁnish
their education.” Action typiﬁes the
words of Flo Garfall, Soph Presi-
dent, “The 18 and .19 year olds are
more prepared to meet the situation
than older men. Statistics prove
that older men break down faster.
We’re out to win this war.”

Terry Smythe, ’46, starts off rather
gruflly but concludes with his usual
eloquence, “I’m just at the age
where I probably wouldn’t think a
heck of~a lot of it, BUT—considering
conditions, 1 think it’s the best. way
for winning this war.” Howie Lynch,
Myskania, believes that the elderly
married men should stay at home.
(Does that let you out, Howie?).

As usual, the women have the last
say. Tony O’Brien, ’46, believes it
is better to take the 18-ycar olds
rather than more of the elder men,
many of whom would consist of
World War I veterans. The Queen
of the Campus makes the concluding
speech. Millie Mallice, ’43, insists, “I
still don’t approve. If the younger
men want to enlist, that’s one thing,
but I do not believe they should be
compelled to leave their education.”

Will this new conscription draft
remain in the “unprecedented” cate-
gory of our government? The an-
swer does not lie with us.

 

Milne Films Start
Fourth Week Run

Presentations of sound tnolion pic—
tures to help student teachers in
their work at Milne will continue for
the fourth consecutive week. Pre-
views are given on Monday, Tues-
day, and Thursday in room 130 of
Milne at 3:35. These ﬁlms are
sponsored by the Audio-Visual De-
partment under the direction of Dr.
1". E. Henrickson.

Monday’s showings will again be
given over to ﬁlms of the sciences.
Reproduction Among Mammals, us—
ing the pig as illustration, will por—
tray thc various phases of propaga-
tion. The structures and functions
of various parts of flowers make up
Flowers at Work. Following that will
be Roots of Plants, which will show
examples of tap, fascicled and ﬁ-
brous rools.

The Borbers of northern Africa
depict the stagnation which accom—
panies isolation of peoples in Back-
ward Civilization, on Tuesday. Ani-
mals in Modern Life will reveal the
present slatus of domesticated ani-
mals the world over, while Conser-
vation of Natural Resources will de-
scribe the waste in the lumbering
and agricultural industries.

Thursday’s ﬁlms offer a variety of
subjects. Tile Westward Movement,
by means of animated drawings, will
show in ils geographic setting the
main points of that movement
front 1790 to 1890. The amazing
phenomena of chemical rcaclions

AD Will Present Plays
Directed by Baird, Bailey

'l‘Wo now plays will be presented
by Advanced Dt‘ttinalics oit next
Tuesday evening at 8:30 P. M. in
Page Hall auditorium. This will be
their second prcscnlalion of the year.

The first play, directed by Eunicc
Baird, '44, Is an cxprcssionislic
drama. The plot concerns two
sophisticated Women, Marion Sovik,
'44, and Betty Marslon, '43, and their
priinilivc or true selves, Marjorie
Brcunig, '44, and Martha Joyce, '45.
This pltiy is unique in that no fool-
liglils will I)t.' used and a diil‘ci'cnt
lighting system will be tried which
will produce all effect with color and
lights.

The second, Escape by Moonlight,
is a psychological play directed by
Jeanne Bailey, ’44. Lucillc Kenny,
'45, stars as a sensitive girl whose
fiance, John Lubcy, ’45, has died six
months previous. Art Collins, ’45,
the family doctor and Rosanne
Hadyn, ’46, complete the cast.

Finks Preparing to Win,
Add Dungarees, Hayseed

No, State has not turned agri-
cultural! Those blue-denimed
figures you see running around
are the Finks. Do you know what
a Fink is? According to Webster's
latest, a Fink is a night howler
with a rovin' eye for his best
friend’s little bundle of sweetness.

But don’t let that gruesome de-
scription frighten you! They are
really just the Thomas More boys
as of last year, with an eye toward
publicity for their football team.
They think that with the aid of
dungarees and a little haysced,
they may have a chance for the
championship. Well, there's no
harm in Finkin'!

 

Student Council Secures

Films for Assembly

Student Council has secured llircc
films from the Ofﬁce of War Infor-
mation for today's assembly. Two
of them are “Keep ’Em Rollin' ” and
"Bombers of Britain.”

Two weeks from today Debalc
Council will continue their policy of
helping more students to boncﬁl
from their activities by the presenta-
tion of Major Thomas A. B. Dillon,
renowned newspaper reporter.

Major Dillon plans to offer an un-
ccitsoi‘cd account of the Dieppe Raid
which he had the opportunity of ob—
serving firsl—hand. Also as part of
his program, the flyer reporter will
speak and answer any questions on
the feasibility and preparation for
tho second front.

Ablc to move freely throughout
the British Isles bccausc of his asso—
ciation made during his career in
the First World War, and in sub—
scqucnl service in China, India,
Africa, and Russia, Major Dillon has
been able lo obscrvc front special
poinls oi vantage lhc initoi' working
of American and Bi'ilish flying
heroes in bomber commands and
coastal operations.

Major Dillon will be lhc second
speaker who has been brought to the
sludcnl body through lIic cil'ot‘ls of
Debate Council.

Dean's List

The addition of three names which
were inadvertently omitted frotn the
Dean’s List, makes the list total 123.
This increases the number of Junior
honor students to 43; tile women on
Dean's List to 103.

Those students are Patricia Frey,
Ruth Friedman, and Mary MacKay,
Juniors.

Clubs Formulate Who’s Who in the Reserves

Plans for Year

Commerce Club, Pan Amigos
Moth Club Hold Meetings

Departmental Clubs started a year
of activity last week with meetings
at which plans for the year were
formulated.

Alma Jewell, ’43, President of
Commerce Club, said that there will
be regular monthly meetings on the
ﬁrst Tuesday of each month. She
further stated that those interested
in joining should sign up on the
third floor of Draper Hall.

Math Club, under the leadership
of Walt Grzywacz, ’43, has planned
regular meetings every month and
special meetings when they are
needed. Talks by students or a
member of the faculty on subjects
not covered by the curriculum will
be featured. An innovation this
year will be social meetings which
will ‘be given over to games and re-
freshments. Membership in Math
Club is open to all those laking
analytical geometry or a higher form
of mathematics.

Pan Amigos, the organization for
Spanish students, is this year led by
Ira Freedman, ’43. Committees for
the year were chosen at a meeting
held last week. The program com-
mitlee consists of Mildred Kirshen~
bluin and Theresa Miscrelli, Juniors,
and Marshall Ackerman, ’46; refresh—
ments, Dorothy Falk, ’45, Gloria
Catnarrolta, and June Semple, Se-
niors; publicity, Gene Mullen, '46,
and Irene Myers, '44; records, Ever-
son Kinn and Arthur Russell, fresh-
men, Irene Myers and Theresa Mi-
screlli, Juniors. The next meeting
will be held in two weeks and will
feature an outside speaker as yet
unknown.

French Club is planning a meeting
on November 4. This will be purely
a social meeting with French games
and songs directed by Wilfred P. Al-
lard, supervisor of French in Milne
forming the entertainment. An added
feature will be a Battle of Wits. with
questions on current events phrased
in French. French Club is open to
all French students or any student
interested in France or French cul-
ture.
