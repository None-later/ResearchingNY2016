The football season is fast coming
to a close, and a hard ﬁght for the
championship looms for the coming
week. (Until yesterday there were
teams tied for the lead. Dorm A,
Kappa Beta, and Potter Club have
each won three and tied once.

On Tuesday afternoon, the occu-

pants of top spot in the. football
league, the Dorm A Trojans and
'Potter Club meet in what wrll un-
doubtedly be the deciding contest
for the championship. Both Potter
eind the Trojans still have one con—
test remaining after Tuesday. . -
, This game promises to be a
“natural”. Potter, defending cham-
pion, has its eye on the ‘second
consecutive football championship,
and in keeping the trophy another
year. The Trojans, however, would
like nothing better than to change
the football trophy’s address from
495 State Street to their Partridge
Street Mansion.

Both squads should be at full
strength for the contest. The Dorm
boys boast weight and a good run.-
ning attack centered about Tassom.
Their passing attack, with Smythe,
Cummings and Bortnick as receivers
has been good for long gains. Until
yesterday the Trojans goal line had
been crossed only once and that
by KB in their 6-6 tie.

Potter, on the other hand, has
many capable substitutes who can
Wear down and tire the opposition
for the ﬁrst stringers. Their passing
attack was further augumented by
the recent innovation of spread
formation in the backﬁeld.

Ruling on Protested Game

The protest in the KB-Trojan
game of last week was over-ruled
by Intramural Council and the
game remains‘as a 6-6 tie. The
protested play oécurred when with
about 4 seconds remaining John
Ricardo went out of bounds after
being tagged. Singer, the time-
keeper, stopped the clock. Dorm
A trailed KB at the time 6—0. The
stopping of the clock gave the
Trojans a chance for a ﬁnal play
and they scored on this play to tie.
KB protested that the watch should
not have been stopped and the
game tieing play was started after
the game was ofﬁcially over.

Referring to the rule book to
Rule 3, Section 4, Article 1; “The
timer shall stop his watch when a
signal indicates that: the ball is out
of bounds,” the members of intra—
mural council rejested the protest
by a 4-2 vote. There was some
opposition because the offensive
team carried the ball out of bounds
after being tagged. Certainly Ri-
cardo did not run out purposely to
délay the game, not when they were
ﬁghting for precious seconds.

WAA Tennis Tourney

KDR Scores Over Dorm B For Second Win

As Finks Suffer Losses To Potter and 5L5,-
Shielts Gain First Victory By Defeating Ramblers

Scoring at will, and stopping KB’s vaunted attack, Potter Club

yesterday scored an overwhelming 43-6 victory. Red

Evans, a superb

passer in this game, threw passes that scored 5 of Potter’s 7 touchdowns.
The EEP boys scored in eVery period. KB’s only touchdown came in the
third quarter when an Evans’ pass was intercepted by Leo Flax on the
KB goal line and run back by him the length of the ﬁeld.

Behind 6-0 at half time, a spirited KDR went to town with a passing
attack that temporarin gave them t 7-6 lead, but they ﬁnally succumbed to
the sharp shooting of Tassoni to lose 12-7.

In its ﬁrst game this week, Potter
Club, resorting to a spread offense,
pushed over two touchdowns against
a hard charging, aggressiVe Fink
team and came away with a 14-0
triumph.

Starting the second quarter with
a 40-yard punt return by Evans to
the Fink 23, EEP moved to its ﬁrst
score. Evans flipped to Reed for a
ﬁrst down on the 8. After a pass
was smothered, Evans ran to the 2.
Two plays later Sussina hit Evans
with a pass into the deep left corner
of the end zone for the score. Evans
clicked with Combs for the extra
point.

Potter’s other touchdown came in
the last quarter when a kick by
Olivet was blocked by a surging
EEP line and downed on the Finlr
20. Sussina threw down the middle
to Hansen for the score. Hansen
then took a pass from Gipp for the
extra point to conclude the scoring
for the day.

Coasting on a thirteen point lead
built up in the ﬁrst half, KDR found
itself up to its neck in Dorm “B”
threats throughout the second half
but kept its goal line uncrossed to
win, 13-0.

Midway in the ﬁrst period, Leon—
ard passed to McNamara on a play
covering two-thirds the length of the
ﬁeld to bring KDR its ﬁrst touch-
down. The second period was four
plays old when KDR hit scoring ter-
ritory for the second time. '

In the ﬁnal period a Chellimi in-
terception on the KDR 25 started
Dorm “B” on its way again. Chel-
limi and Sullivan clicked on a pass
to the KDR 5. A run pushed the
ball to the 2, but here KDR held and
took possession of the ball on downs.

Dorm “B” made its new—found
attack felt in its next game, on Tues-
day, when it gained its ﬁrst triumph
of the year, 13-6, over the still vic-
tory—less Ramblers. In the ﬁrst
period, the Shieks, at ﬁrst stopped
by a Duncan interception on the
Rambler 4, scored on a 20-yard
Chellimi-to-Sullivan pass.

In the second quarter, a Shiek
pass to the Rambler 6 was inter—
cepted by Max Braun and run back
for a touchdown.

Smitten for the third time by a
fourth-quarter jinks, the speedy
Finks saw a 13-12 victory suddenly
and swiftly turned into a crushing
24-13 rout at the hands of a hard-
charging SLS outﬁt. Striking the
second time they had the ball, the
Finks moved into the lead when
Olivet faded to the SL8 twenty and
threw to Tucker for a touchdown.
Guarino, who had to reverse his
field twice before scoring.

The fourth quarter jinks overtook
the Finks and in quick succession
two punts were run back for SLS
touchdowns, the first by l'lippick,
who did a neat tight—rope act along
the sideline, and the second by

'CommandoCourse

Near Compleation

Course Will Comply
With NYS Regulations

Coach Hatﬁeld recently released
the information that the commando
course now under construction in
back of the school will be completed
next week. So far, the ﬁrst two
obstacles have been completed, and
the remainder of the course has
been marked out with stakes.

The course will comply with
speciﬁcations set up by the New
York State Department of Education.
The over all length will be one
hundred yards. The ﬁrst obstacle
is a two and one-half foot hurdle.
Next is a wall which must be vaulted
with the use of one or both arms.
Eighteen feet past this is a maze
of upright dodge—poles set in a
Zigzag pattern through which the
meen mut go. The climax of the
trial will be the eight—foot wall
means within the runner‘s power.
which must be surmounted by any

Beyond the wall will be a rope
stretched two feet above the ground
under which the men must crawl.
After getting up, the men must
leap over an eight foot ditch. In
addition to this, awnarrow, snake—
like catwalk set two feet from the
ground must be negotiated. Then
the contestant must run ten yards,
up and over a ramp measuring four
feet at the highest point. From
there , the runner will run the
remaining ten yards to the ﬁnish
line. The course has been built
to allow two men to compete at the
same time. If a contestant should at
any time exceed the bounds of the
course, he would be disqualiﬁed
immediately.

Coach Hatﬁeld quoted the admin-
istration as saying that every man
who is physically fit, regardless of
size, will be required to negotiate
the course. Each man will be timed,
and will be expected to make the
fastest time possible. “Of course,”
the coach added, “judgement will be
made according to the individual's
athletic ability and body coordina-
ti m.”

WAA Banquet Postponed

Win Jones, president, announces
that the annual WAA banquet which
was to have been held on Tuesday
October 27, as was stated in the
Freshman Handbook, has been post-
poned. No New date was decided
upon.

There will be a week-end at
Camp Johnston soon. Pat Frey
is in charge of the camp and all
thosce interested should contact her.

Leads in Rivalry

The class of ’45 has managed to
take a short but early lead in rivalry.
With the present score standing at

-3 to 2, the ﬁnal outcome, of course,
[still to be reckoned by Fate and if

the spirit shown by both so for con—
tinues, it looks as though it will be
touch and go until Moving Up Day.

The freshmen started strong a
week ago today when they cut-
smarted, outran and outpushed the
Sophomores in pushball to the tune
of a 15-6 victory. Using his men to
good advantage, Marty Bortnick
swung an expert clearing squad be-
fore the ball and a mass of muscle
behind to cross the goal line once
in the ﬁrst half and twice in the
second. Although the Sophs tried
hard to stem the tide they could not
gain enough momentum to score.
gaining their points by virturc of be—
ing over the line in enemy territory
at the half and ﬁnal whistle.

The next afternoon, however, a
revived “Crimson Tide" smothered
the helpless “Blue Devils" in touch
football, turning in a 27—6 score. The
frosh took the lead by scoring late
in the ﬁrst quarter, but the Sophs
swiftly tied in the second and the
score read 6-6 at the half.

During the second half, despite
numerous penalties, the Sophs
passed and ran to score three more
touchdowns and an extra point.

Frosh Hoopsters
Continue Practice

The freshmen basketeers continued
daily practice this week in prepara-
tion for the coming season. Coach
Hatﬁeld and‘his assistant coache's
are still stressing essentials only,
with scrimmages to come sometime
later. All the frosh aspirants are
very enthusiastic, hoping not only
for a place on the Junior Varsity,
but also Visioning the possibility of a
varsity birth.

Many difﬁculties have been en-
countered in drawing up a schedule
for the Junior Varsity. Union Col-
lege Frosh, and Albany Academy
opponents of the Frosh in previous
years, cannot be played this year.
Union College will hav'e no Frosh 'or
JV team this year. Albany Academy,
in order that it might compete with
local high schools, decided to abide
by the NYS scholastic rules, which
do not allow participation in games
with college teams. However, games
have deﬁnitely been scheduled with
the RPI Frosh, and a full quota of
games will be scheduled with other
area teams. Probable opponents in—
clude Siena, JV, Albany Pharmacy
College, Albany YMCA, and Albany
Business College.

The freshmen will have a better
chance of winning this year than in
former years. They will be playing
with upperclassmen on the JV and
so will benefit by their experience.

Annual Campus
Drive to Start

Coming Monday

Greenberg Will Use
Solicitor System Again

Campus Chest, under the direction
of Sol Greenberg, ’43, is conducting
its second annual drive from Novem-
ber 2 through November 10. This
plan was instigated last year to avoid
the confusion of small insigniﬁcant
drives carried on by the various or—
ganizations.

The system of solicitors will again
be followed this year. Students will
be contacted through their group
houses Certain sophomores and ju-
niors will be especially designated
to get in touch with commuters. As
a ﬁnal check, a table will be set up
across from the student mail boxes
for those students who have been
unapproached.

Distribution of Funds

Some of the money will be con—
tributed to the World Service Fund
which aids those students who are
now war prisoners in different coun-
tries. China Relief is included under
this category. Funds will be donated
to the Red Cross War Chest, Infan—
tile Paralysis, Tuberculosis Drive,
the United Service Organization,
Naval Relief, and the Cancer Fund.
Fifty dollars has already been
pledged to the State College NEWS.

Receipts will be given for all
amounts of money collected. Tags
will be placed on students so that
no one will be approached twice.

$500 Goal of Drive

Sol Greenberg, ’43, chairman, says,
“These are times when the money is
vitally needed, more so than ever
before. Our goal is $500.00. We’d
like to see the students respond in a
big way. We'd like to have them
give just as much as they can, at
least ﬁfty cents and more if possible.
We're likely to surpass last year’s
record, if we get the co-operation
that we should."

Assisting Grecnbcrg are Emin
Blasiar, ’43, Don Vanas, '43, Harold
Ashworth, '44, and William Tucker,
'44, Sara T. DcLaney, Dean of
Women, is the faculty advisor.

Group to Probe
Annex Situation

As a result of recent action taken
by the State College News and
Forum regarding the quality of
sandwiches served in the Annex, Dr.
John M. Saylcs, President of the
College, will appoint a joint faculty—
student committee to investigate the
situation. The purpose of this com-
mittee will be to determine the ac-
tual facts regarding nutritive value,
prices, and appearance of sandwiches
which are sold there.

At its Wednesday meeting, Forum
passed a resolution to support the
News in any action which it might
take. The News will publiin the
facts of the situation and then take
steps to bring about a condition must
agreeable to all parties concerned,
Various informal questioning among
the student body brought out the
(.Ilﬁl'ilVUl' which most had about the
Annex food.

In making the survey, the com—
mittee will meet with Miss Laura
'I‘hompson, Manager of the College
Cafeteria, to determine what can be
done to alleviate undesirable condi—
tions in this respect. SUch factors as
rise in food priccs, ditliculty in ob-
tnining certain types of foods, and
labor invoIVcd will be considered,

Signum Laudis Members

Dr. John M. Saylcs disclosed
the names of the first group of
Sigma Laudis members. The fol—
lowing were choscn: Owen Bom-
bard, Ellen Dell's, Marjorie Halstead,
Laura Hughes, Muriel Scovell, and
Sylvia Tefft.

On November 10, Hal Singer,

leaving State College. Destina-
tion: United States Navy.

Reporting at Northwestern, he
will receive four months of

him to the commission of ensign.

When asked why he didn‘t
transfer to the air corps, Singer
replied, “I can swim without a

KDR, Potter, KB
Will Hold Parties

Informality, Comfort
Keynote of Fun Frolics

Pulling rabbits from a hat,
breaking unbreakable bonds, and
even making a freshman disappear,
will be the simple task of the
magician obtained by Potter Club
to provide only a portion of
the entertainment at their smoker
on this evening from 8:30 to 12 p. m.,
for their first rush affair of the
year. Roy Williams, ’44, Chair-
man of the event, exclaimed, “With
no women present to hinder oper—
ations, you can't tell what will
happen!"

Glaring pumpkins, rosy apples,
brown corn stalks, and terrifying
witches will provide the atmosphere
for the KDR and KB “Halloween”
parties, 8:30 to 12 pm. tomorrow
night at the KDR house and the
Lounge respectively.

“We will take you back to those
wonderful days of your childhood
when you had not a worry in the
world!" explained in unison Harold
Goldstein, '45, KB Master of Cere-
monies, and Fred Beyer, ’44, Chair—
man of the KDR party. Informality
and comfort will be the keynote.
Guests will be asked to dress as
they were when they received in-
vitations. Hard cider and old
fashioned doughnuts will satiatc
hearty appetites, stimulated by the
quickening tempo of the parties.

Ray Vcrrcy, Glen DeLong and
Richard Beach became members of
Kappa Delta Rho recently. Potter
Club pledged Carr Pangburn, Fay

Slogan of Campus ChestL Drive

by Sunnu (.‘oopcr

Are you one of those who would
like to do more in the war effort,
or do you just talk about it Are
you the Joe College who drives his
car unnecessarily, or do you take the
bus when possible? Docs indiffer—
ence characterize your attitude or
real concern? Is your name John
Doe, Americanﬁ-or John Doe? Here
is the chance to show your colors.

From November 2 to November 11.
Campus Chest is conducting its sec—
ond annual drlvc. Each student will
be expected to contribute fifty cents
wor more. State College will be
talking in terms of money to aid in
a war that speaks in terms of lives.
As Sol Greenberg, ’43, Chairman,
says, “This drive is conducted but
once a year. It is a war activity in
which each and chry student has
a duty to perform. More than ever
before, we need CID—OPERATION to
the utmost. Get out your ﬁfty cent

piece, and then see how much of
your 'con money' you can toss in
with it."

Where will your money go'.’ It
will go through the World Service
Fund, to students who are now War
prisoners. Your money will help
buy bandages and medical supplies
for the Red Cross. Your money will
contribute toward the fight against
tuberculosis, infantile paralysis,
cancer. And some Chinese soldier
will look at a box labelch C,W.li.
(China War Relief), and for all any—
one knows, it might be the box of
supplies State College bought.

The Campus Chest committee has
done its part. The rest is in the
hands of the student body. Begin—
ning Monday, eight days will be set
aside to tally up the score. Remem-
ber when you’re approached~~you
may be giving fifty cents while
someone, somewhere, is giving his
life.

Debate Council
To Discuss War

The College Debate Council is to
sponsor a discussion before the War
Education Forum of Albany on Wed—
nesday night, November 4 at 7:30
in Joseph Henry Memorial Hall.
The theme of the evening’s speeches
will be mainly the second front in
Europe with particular emphasis on
Russia’s part in this proposed move
in the war.

Four members of the Council will
speak, considering the different
anglcs of the military plan. Joseph
flights, '44, will discuss the military
problems which confront Russia to—
day. Maric Soule, '43, will devote
her speech to the part the United
States is playing in the war, includ-
ing the aid America has given Rus—
sia and her allies. What the United
States could do and where a second
front could be opened will be con—
sidercd by Sol Greenberg, '43. Thcse
three factors will be balanced by the
final speaker, Harry Wurtz, '44, who
will review our past relationships
with Russia and our hopes for future
bonds of amnity. He will sum up the
evening's topic with remarks on the
general affect of an immediate front
on the total war. Dorothy Huyck
will act as mediator and the meeting
will be opened for discussion, debate
and questioning.

Snow Issues Appeal
For More Musicians

"The orchestra must bc a balanced
organization,” according to Earle
Snow, '44, director; therefore outside
players from Vincentian Institute,
Albany High School and lVllInc lligh
School will be used to round out
the orchestra. The response to a
call for more players in the sym—
phony, cspccially in certain sections,
has not been satisfactory and there—
fore this method must be used in
order to make an orchestra possible
this year.

()n the other hnnd, there has been
too large n response of clni'inctists.
Snow announces that competitive
try—outs will be held shortly to limit
the Clarinets to two.

At present the orchestra is re-
henrsing for a concert to be held in
the future. "Prelude to the 3rd
Act of Lohengrin," “Emperor Waltz."
and the "Grand March from Aida”
are among the numbers. These are
in the original editions.

Frosh to Parade,
Sing in Assembly

The traditional frosh parade
around the auditorium to prove
their talents, musical and otherwise,
will be the highlights of today’s
assembly program. At a signal
from Harley Dingman, ’43, college
songmastcr, the frosh will rise in
their places, 259 strong, to sing the
Alma Mater. After this, the frosh
will sing "Life is Very Different"
over and over again, trailing their
class marshals up and down the
aisles of Page l'lnll. Sophomores are
oflicinl Itccklcrs for the program,
while Juniors will follow the for-
ciblc appeasement policy

Feature of last year's frosh sing
(Class of 1945) was the funeral
march and burial of a belated Soph—
omorc (Class of 1944). The your
previous, the freshmen (Class of
iii-ti) added to the general mer-
rhncnt by composing tricky verses
to the tune of “Life is Very Differ~
cut”. As yet, the Class of 1946 has
issued no bulletins as to what they
have plumch for today's program.

During the assembly Forum and
the State College News will conduct
a poll on current events and student
opinion. The results will be pub-
lished in next week's issue of the
State College News.
