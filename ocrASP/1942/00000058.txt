r Tuesda , oot 8 wt e
thiﬁgeof the palslt for State College.
With the coming of the end of the
season congratulations are in order,
and ﬁrst in line is, of course, the

-winner, Potter Club, .The State

' Street lads played brilliant ballun
their last four contests, after starting
rather , slowly.

' Potter really showed its mettle in
defeating KB and Dorm A, and all
but clinched the title in these con—
tests. It is. true that both Dorm
aggregations were seriously bandit-i
. capped by injuries when they playe
Potter. However, this cannot detract
from Potter’s might.

I The Trojans carried only eight
men on the squad, but only 51x. were
of ﬁrst squad calibre. A Similar
situation existed with Kappa Beta,

» who, while carrying more men on
the roster, had only srx or seven

I good players. These regulars were
forced to play the whole of every

‘ contest. As the season wore on,

' injuries depleted their ranks. Hav-
ing no capable substitutes they were

' forced to patch up their teams as
best possible.

On the other hand, Potter Club
had at least two full teamsat every
game, eleven of whom Were'ofufirst
string calibre. Therefore, aspne of
their men tired, he was eastly rey~
placed without hurting the teams
chances. It was this wealth of ma-
terial plus a neat passing attack that
brought the football title to Potter
Club again this year.

We also like to congratulate Intra-
mural Council, especially Charlie
Capel and Art Flax, for running the
league so smoothly. Rule changes
were quickly made when needed.
and refereeing, although spotty at
times, was the best in years.

Most Valuable

Before we turn our attentions to
basketball, we like to present the
men whom we think were most
valuable to their football squads.

Potter Club—Frank Hansen. He
played brilliantly, defensively, charg-
ing hard and fast to rush the op-
position. I-Ie also proved a good pass
receiver.

Trojans—Joe Tassoni. As a run-
ner Joe was very hard to stop all
season long. He can also kick and
pass well.

Kappa Beta—«Joe Levin. He had
KB geared into high with his pass—
ing until injuries moved in. He is
also a consistent punter.

SLS~~I3uck l—lippick. Buck has
been an elusive runner and con—
sistent runner for the SLS squad
all season. Many a time he has
neatly evaded charging ends to whip
a long pass or start a run.

KDR wBob Leonard. As leader of
his team he made KDR a consistent
threat, though not a consistent win-
ner. IIe kicked, ran, and passed for
KDl't and played excellent ball dc-
fensively.

Pinks-«Art (.)IIVct. As a smooth
runner and passer and an excellent
kicker, ()livct sparked the Finks all
season long. I'Iis playing ability
made the It‘luks in throat all season.

Dorm "B" ~Dick Chillemi. One of
the smallest players, Dick made
some nice runs for the Dorm Juniors
along with organizing them into a
lighting outfit.

lininblers Max Iirnun. Braun was
the only spark of the hopeless
Ramblers. lie did all the punting
and Inosi of the passing and running.

We realize that win-never a list,
as the nbch, is made thcrr.I is always
disagreement. We do not. think that
this list is an exception. We may
be wrong, but these are our vich.
If you disagree with us, sorry.

To Keep I-M Football Title

KDR Vanq'uishes Finks,
Drops Game To SL5,-
Potter Takes Dorm A’

This week’s action on the intra-
mural gridiron saw Potter Club
clinch the title for the second con-
secutive year, by winning over both
the Trojans, 21-12, and the Ramblers,
19-7.

The first score in yesterday’s
game against the Ramblers was made
by Potter on a pass from Evans to
Hansen soon after the game’s open—
ing play.

Early in the second quarter, Pot-
ter again broke loose with a pass
to Kullman for their second score,
but the pass for this extra point
was batted down. On the second
play after the kickoff, to the Ramb-
lers, Duncan threw a pass to
Dooley who then ran half the
length of the ﬁeld to score.

Late in the fourth, Potter scored
the ﬁnal touchdown of the game on
a run by Evans.

Last Tuesday, Potter took a hard-
fought 24-12 win over the Trojans.
The only score in the ﬁrst quarter
was made by Potter on three suc-
cessive passes by Evans. The try
for the extra point was unsuccess—
ful.

Again in the second quarter, Pot—
ter scored two more rapid touch-
downs on passes, one Evans to
Hansen, the other Sussina to Reed.
Both times the try for the extra
point failed.

Starting the fourth quarter. Pot-
ter scored on the first play, a pass
from Sussina to Lynch, but the
extra point play was again unsuc-
cessful.

With about five minutes playing
time left, Merritt carried the ball
to Potter's three yard line after
picking a fumble by Hansen out
of the air. Two plays later, the
Dorm boys scored on a snappy
Welch to Cummings to Tassoni lat-
eral play, but missed the extra
point.

Two minutes later Bortnick in—
tercepted a pass from Gipp on the
Potter 15 and carried the ball over
for the Dorm's second score. Again
the extra point trial failed and the
game ended 55 seconds later with
the ball in Potter's possession.

KDR also played two games this
week, losing the first to SLS, 13—7,
and winning the second from the
Finks, 25-0.

In yesterday's game against the
It'lnks, KDR's vaunted shift and
power were working well, as two
of their touchdowns were scored
on running plays. KDlt led all the
way after their first touchdown
was scored early in the first quar-
ter on a pass from Leonard to
MaeNamara.

In the third quarter, the Lake
Avenue lads again broke loose and
scored [WU touchdowns on running
plays. The filial touchdown was
scorutl in the middle of the fourth
quarter, again on a pass from
Leonard to MacNauuu‘n.

Last Tuesday, SLS battled its \u.iy
to a Iii-7 victory over KDR. Taking
the lead in the first quarter with a
touchdown pass from liippick to
(Irillin and a successful extra point
conversion, the SIS six held on to it
until the third quarter. 'l‘hcn KI)“
brokc through to lie the score, with
a pass from [monard to Maannmrn
and a successful extra point trial.

Twice in the final stanza 51.5
threatened before they were ablc to
score again.

CommandoCourse
To Start Program

Every male of the college who
is physically ﬁt will soon ﬁnd him-
self negotiating the newly completed
commando course which has been
built behind the school. Coach
Hatﬁeld expects the full program
to get under way within the next
week.

With the return of better weather,
work has been ﬁnished on the
last few obstacles during the past
few days. Constructed according
to standard specﬁications, this train-
ing is expected to prepare the men
for the more intensive instruction
which they will receive in the
services. With an eye to the fu-
ture, the administration has there-
fore decided that every male student
should compete whether he is in
the Reserves or in immediate pros—
pect of joining the armed forces.

The freshman and sophomore gym
classes have already started the
course and, despite spills and
bruises, have generally expressed
approval of the program. Coach
Hatﬁeld said that other classes will
be held at nine and ten o'clock to
take care of the rest of the upper-
classmen. A third class may also
have to be arranged for later in
the day to insure attendance from

Rivalry Hockey Game
Scheduled for Today

The girls’ rivalry hockey game
is scheduled to be played this after-
noon, at 4:30, in front of Page Hall.
It will undoubtedly be an exciting
game, as three rivalry points are at
stake.

The sophomores signed up to play
under the captaincy of Marion Duf-
fy, include Mary Sanderson, Mary
Now, Nancy Hall, Leah Tischler,
Lucille Gerg, Jean Winyall, Flo Gar-
fall, and Nora Giavelli. The fresh—
men playing are “Mike” Butow,
“Bobby” VanAuken, Winnie Lul-
koski, Lil Abrams, Eileen Shoup,
Helen Slack, and Beth Harper.

The game, which was supposed
to have been played last Tuesday,
was postponed until now because
it was decided that both teams
needed more practice.

At present, due to the sophomore
women's victory over the frosh in
the obstacle races held last Thurs—
day, the rivalry score is now 6—2, in
favor of the sophs. A large turn—
out and much enthusiasm livened
up these races. Those participating
were Flo Garfall, Nora Giavolli,
Mary Sanderson, Alma Beekerle,
Joan I-Iylincl, Marie DcChene, Peggy
Dee, Mary Now, Leah Tischler, and
Jean Bcrkhardt for the sophs. Fresh-
men contestants were Eileen Shoup,
Marie Scudder. Winnie Lulkoski,
Helen Slack, Peggy Casey and
“Bobby” VnuAukeu.

Coach Calls,- Condidoies Respond,-

Heighf, Speed, Spirit PresentL

 

by Stan Gipp

The ﬁrst call for varsity basket-
ball candidates was issued Wednes—
day and twentyﬁve aspirants includ-
ing six freshmen answered. Seven
of last year’s Iettermen: Combs,
Flax, Gerber, Hansen, Marsland,
Miller, and Young; and three of last
year’s Frosh: Hippick, Kullman, and
Olivet, looked ready and willing to
play and win for State.

Conspicuous by their absences
were Bora, a letterman two years
ago, and Mullin, leader of last year’s
bi-victorious freshmen, but they are
expected to appear at practice soon.
In order to help patch up the
breaches left by the graduation of
Dickson, Brauner, Siefert, and the
drafting of Tom Feeney, honorary
captain, several of last year’s intra—
mural stars were present in uniform,
notably: Capel, Kensky, Lynch,
Reed, Ruback, and Wise.

Coach G. Elliott Hatfield has an-
nounced that the freshmen are
eligible for varsity berths and has
hinted that the chances are fair for
one or two of them. Judging from
the high school experience of several
of them, they may aid the teams,
both the varsity and junior—varsity,
considerably.

Hatﬁeld retains his usual pesimis-
tic views despite the speed, height,
and spirit he has at his command,
but maybe this is a coach’s right.

Over—conﬁdence is bad for any team,
but let’s at least have conﬁdence.
Wednesday’s debut was character—
ized by exercises and passing drills
for condition and fundamentals are
all important in basketball as in any
other sport. Erratic passing and
creaking muscles will disappear
gradually with time and diligence.
The “figure eight” appears to be
the type of offense to be employed
by Hatfield’s prodigies, who may this
year have the stuff to make it suc-
cessful. However, both the offense
and defense will be subject to
change depending on the style and
threat of the various opponents.
With the memories of last year's
St. Lawrence and RPI games still
before us, we are hopeful and con—
fident that the team will attain and
display that kind of form and spirit
throughout the new campaign.

Latimer Wins Tennis Match

Pat Latimer defeated Eileen Shoup,
{5-0, 6—1, in the only match played
this week in WAA’s tennis tourney.
Because of the poor weather, the
Washington Park courts could not be
used most of this week. Therefore
the closing day of the tournament,
which was to have been last Tues-
day, has been postponed so that the
three remaining matches may be
completed.

Assembly Today
Will Head-Line

Dieppe Witness
Major Ditton Brought As
Debate Council Guest

Traditional soldier-of-fortune, spe-
cial correspondent for the Baltimore
Sun, the receiver of eight medals for
bravery—Major Thomas A. B. Dit-
ton will give uncensored information
in assembly today on his eye-witness
observance of the Dieppe Raid.

Major Ditton is being brought to
assembly as part of Debate Council's
policy of helping a greater number
of students to benefit from their
program.

A native-born American, Major
Ditton ran away from Virginia Mili-
tary Institute in 1914 to volunteer in
the Canadian Forces. Thereupon
began his World War I feats which
marked him as the youngest Cap-
tain in the British Army in addition
to his distinguished record in the
Royal Flying Corps of which he was
an oilicet'.
l’ast Experience

After the war, he went as a Brit—
ish soldier to China, India, and
Africa; on a secret service mission,
he visited Russia. His experience,
gained so extensively in the past.
enables him today to view from
especial points of vantage the inner
workings of the American and
British flyers in Fighter Sweeps,
Bomber Conmmnds, Coastal Opera-
lions.

With the forceful impact, Major
Ditton’s efforts today follow through
his reputation of merit in World War
I. In 1940, as a flying reporter, be
rendered the first complete account
of the naval and air bases obtained
from Great Britain. In September,
1941, as an ofﬁcer on an armed
British Merchantmen, he learned
through personal experience what
the Allied forces are doing to clear
the sea lanes and eliminate the
submarine threats. And in 1942, he
was ﬁghting with the Rangers, Com—
mandos, and the “forgotten heroes"
in the historic Dieppe Raid.
“Second Front"

The Major has witnessed all the
preparations being made for the
“Second Front," which two years
ago, he foretold would not become
a reality until the spring of 10-11.
His conception of the clock-like
mechanism of the army, navy, and
air force is all too vivid. The de—
centralization of industry in England
is an actual reality to him. Dicppe
is a weird dream that. is not a dream.

This morning, State College has
the opportunity to hear from this
dynamic personality, and have World
War [I set beforc them in all its
uncensored clarity.

Annex Committee

Reveals Purpose

Group Will Propose
Bigger, Better Lunches

Responding to an invitation from
the President of the College, Dr.
John M. Saylt‘s, a committee for in—
vestigation of the operation of the
Annex and Cafeteria met Monday
afternoon in the Faculty Lounge.
The committee in its entirety is com-
posed of Mr. George M. York, Pro-
fessor of Commerce, the chairman;
Mrs. Anna Barsam, Instructor in
Home Economics in Milne; Dr. Caro—
line Croasdale, Professor of Hygiene;
Dr. Louis Jones, Assistant Professor
of English; Dr. Robert W. Frederick,
Principal of the Milne School; Dr.
Minnie Scotland, Assistant Professor
of Biology; Dr. Robert Rienow, As-
sistant Professor of Social Studies;
Don Vanas and Shirley Wurz, Se-
niors; Mary Studebaker and Ber—
nard Skolsky, Juniors; Natalie Mann
and Harry Mosher, Milne.

Shortly after the discussion was
opened, the committee made it clear
that their purpose was not to bicker
about the amount of cheese in a
cheese sandwich, but rather to in-
sure the best possible lunch for State
and Milne students at the least pos-
sible coat. The present program of
rising cost of food has made it dif—
ficult for Miss Laura Thompson,
Manager of the Cafeteria and An—
nex, to maintain the same prices and
standards of previous years. The
committee wished to help her with
this problem.

Not all of the committee was
present, but enough members were
there to make it representative of
the vieWs of the faculty, and State
and Milne students. The discussion
was very inforuml, and it was found
that the participants knew little
about thc cost of food and help in—
volved in planning for the school
lunches. Accordingly they invited
Miss Thompson to present them with
these facts at a mceting on Monday.

Dr. Frederick also pointed oul
that while both Millie and State are
supposedly confining their eating to
the Annex and Cafeteria area, the
high school students have noticed
State people taking food outside
these areas and naturally resent the
fact they cannot do the same. This
is the fault of the college students,
who should obey the rules of the
C'unpus Commission, and eat only
in the area Llcsignatcd.

Photographic Show Planned

Miss liuth llutchins, Assistant
Professor of It'lnc Arts, has an—
nounced that the Art Department
will hold its Annual Photographic
Show in li‘ehrunry. Those who
wish to enter the contest should
bring back photographs after Christ-
mas Vacation.

Work must be mounted on 11 x 14
inch paper or cardboard. Students
may submit as many photographs
as they wish, and more than one
can be mounted on the same sheet.
The judges will be selected later.

Guest of D & A
Nils Hogner to Exhibit

Illustrations In Lounge

The prominent illustrator and lec-
turer, Nils Hogner, will come to
State College Monday afternoon. As
the guest of the Dramatics and Art
Council, Mr. Hogner will speak at
3:30 in the Lounge, where a set of
his drawings are on exhibit.

Mr. Hogner was born in Boston of
Scandinavian descent. He attended
the Boston School of Fine Arts and
Painting and the Rhodes Academy in
Copenhagen, Denmark. After the
last World War, in which he took
part, he went to New Mexico for his
health, and taught in the University
of New Mexico for four years. While
there, Miss Dorothy Childs, a Con-
necticut school teacher, came to New
Mexico for the summer to escape
boredom. She returned the next
summer and got her degree in
Archeology and a husband—Nils
Hogner.
ilogners Collaborate

The Hogners work together on
their books; Mrs. Hogner writes
them and Mr. Hogner illustrates
them. Among the books they have
written for adults are. South of
Pndri, Westward, High, Low and
Dry, and Summer Roads to Guspe.

They also have written many
books for children. Some of these
are Ladybird, Stormy, The First
Mustcny, Pancho, Don’t Blame the
Puffins, Navajo Winter Nights, Edu-
cation of a Burro, Children of Mom—
ico, and Little Esther. Pancho, which
is on exhibit in the library, contains
a pen and ink sketch of a capering
goat drawn especially for Dr. Wat-t
Stewart, Professor of History, a pcr~
sonal friend of Mr. Hogner.
Combines Cookery and Art

Nils Hogner is very versatile. He
built his own home in Litchfield,
Connecticut. He can cook, and
boasts that once he took a car apart,
put it back together again, and drove
across the desert in it with only the
aid of a compass. He and Mrs.
Hogner usually spend their summer
traveling.

Among the awards received by
Mr. Hogner are: the Block Printing
and Landscape Prize of the Museum
of Northern Arizona in 1931), the
Prize Portrait from the New Mexico
Art League, and Honors at Al—
buquerque, in 1933.

day evening at 8 P. M. in Newman
Hall. The evening's program will
follow the custmnary benediction
service given by Father Cahill at
'1230 P. M.

The discussion is based upon the
new Social Studies Curriculum for
.Iunior and Senior High Schools.
The purpose of this plan has been to
follow the developments of world in-
stitutions through the ages, such as
the family, manufacturing, and edu-
cation. Newman Club's program will
evolve around the progress of re-
ligion and its importance in the life
history of man. What the various
religions have taught, what protec-
tion they have offered to man, and
how they have been used will be
some of the points included.

The discussion will begin with in—
formal talks given by Mac Whiting,
Betty Bailey, Shirley Wurz, and
Lucy Massimilllan, Seniors, who will
act as chairmen. A period devoted
to questions and debate will follow
and thus give all a chance to par-

Symth Elected;
Shifts Numerous
In Revote Polls

By a margin of five votes,
Stanley Abrams triumphed over
Dale Wood in the second revote
for the Freshman Presidency,
held in the Commons last Mon,-
duy. One hundred and seventy-
.scvcn ballots were cast in a
strong showing for a second rc-
rotc. The numerical results of
the elections (published in full
on pages I and 3 today's State
(Zollcgc News) show that Abrams,
although the lowest ranking can-
(lnlalc on the two previous bal-
luls, was able to muster enough
strength to pull himself through
to final victory.

Myskania, Senior Campus Honor-
ary Society, released for publication
by the News, the complete results
of the two—week long election. Can-
d1dates elected in the last two re-
votes are: President, Stanley
Abrams; Vice-President, Terrence
Smyth; Secretary, Anita Pedisich;
Treasurer, Robert Wilcox; Song-
leader, Mary Lou Casey; Cheer-

were held yesterday to determine
the final choices of the class for
Treasurer and Songleader.
