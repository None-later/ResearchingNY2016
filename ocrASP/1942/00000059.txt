that the committee appointed by Dr. john M.

have been set for it. Not looking at the situa-
tion as one itt which the chief complaint is
merely the scarcity of ample filling In the sand-

The complexity of the problem before them
was the first poittt recognized by the Committee.

these were unable to be answered by the (Lom-

son, Manager of the Cafeteria attd Annex, answer
them at a meeting of the Cottmtittcc planned for

War Fronts by Feigenbaum

Beginning of Second Front Seen

In Allied Victory Over Rommel '

General B. L. Montgomery, in
command of the British 8th Army in
Egypt, laid his plans well. He did
not not underestimate the ability of
his foxy opponent, and he knew the
deadly effectiveness of Rommel’s 88
mm. ﬁeld guns which practically de-
stroyed the entire tank strength of
the British army last summer.':

For twelve days General Mont—
gomery’s artillery tenaciously ham—
mered all along the strongly forti-
ﬁed Axis line from El Alamein forty
miles south to the Quattara Depres-
sion. His heavy guns and infantry
kept up a ceaseless day and night
assault which gradually produced a
soft spot in the Axis defenses.

This spot developed just north of
the center part of the line—and
Montgomery was quick to seize his
opportunity. Last Sunday night, at
2 A. M. he sent Australian infantry
forward in a shattering attack on
Axis slrongpoints.

The Aussies cleaned out a gap in
Rommel’s line and plunged seven-
teen miles into his depth defenses.
Allied infantry was followed closely
into the gap by massed tanks which
broke out into the open desert be-
hind Rommel's positions. The Nazi
commander was forced to throw in

his reserve tank forces in a last ef-
fort to prevent a definite break-
through. It failed.

Rommel was forced to order a re—
treat so that he would not be en-
circled. No respite is being given
the fleeing Axis columns. The full
weight of Allied air strength in the
western desert is being brought to
bear, blasting the closely packed mo-
torized units and stumbling infantry.

Now that he has started his re-
treat, Rommel must keep falling
back until he reaches a defendable
position, and such a spot cannot be
found until he reaches the Libyan
border.

This smashing preliminary triumph
by the 8th Army under General
Montgomery may be the Allies' an—
swer to Stalin's demand for a second
front. However, if the Axis can be
eliminated from North Africa, the
undefended coastline of Italy will be
very vulnerable to invasion by com-
bined land, air, and sea forces from
African bases.

The United States High Command
announced that 7,000 American
troops which included air force,
ground crew, mechanics, tank out~
fits, and the first American nurses to
reach the Middle East were in the
convoy. The convoy did not sight
any enctny ships or submarines and
landed without a single casualty.

 

Milk and Meows

To the Editor:

I congratulate you on your stand
concerning the Annex sandwich sit-
uation. Traditional State gripers
will have to change tactics now
and search for a new “gripegoat” to
fasten their tentacles upon. As I
am a member of that class of “gripe-
scapisfs," I know. BUT, I have still
one minor point to be brought up
in regard to the Annex.

Every forcnoon I sit through my
class watching the clock and wait
for the hands to come together at
twelve. Why? Because I am look-
ing forward to my sandwich and a
nice cool refreshing half pint of
milk. Rushing down to the Annex
after class, I squeeze through the
door and fight my way up to the
counter. I grab a sandwich, a bot-
tle of milk and find—what? That
cool drink I have been looking for-
ward to is not to be had. Instead
is a warm while beverage.

I realize this is but a minor point,
Mr. Editor, but please, can't sotnc—
thing be done about a situation that
is fast becoming tragic?

An Annex Sandwich Eater.

 

To ilie Editor:

A State College Freshman is sit-
ting alone on one side of a train,
on the other side is a Sorority girl.
Neither knows anyone else on the
train. They can not talk! Inter-
sorority Council savs so! Even when
they arrive at their hometown they
can't talk! Personally, I think that
is carrying,, things too far. What
right has a State College associa-
tion to tell us what we're to do
at home? It will only lead to dis-
aster. Rules arc like rubber. If
they're too tight, they'll be broken.
I don’t believe in revolt, but with
two weeks of silent period including
vacation—~phcw—I’ll go nuts!

I agree that a short silent period
is necessary to give the bewildered
frosh time to collect their senses
and make the right choice, but
I don't think it is even practicable
i.) try to keep people from talking
to their friends in their home town.
After all, there probably won't be
anyone to check up and if a few
can get away with breaking a rule,
it. might better be lifted. Or else,
as the Russians would say, "Then
comes the revolution!"

Bulger Reveals

Teacher Shortage
ln Many Fields

Army, Navy, Industry
Vital Drawing Factors

“The present shortage of teachers
is exceedingly acute,” stated Paul
Bulger, Director of the Student Em-
ployment Bureau, in an interview
earlier this week. “Due to existing
teacher supply, or rather the lack
of supply,” said Mr. Bulger, “some
schools have had to double up teach-
ing schedules, and even, at times,
to drop courses, such as industrial
arts, for which there are almost no
available teachers. We have many
calls for teachers in mathematics,
science, physical education, indus-
trial arts, and commerce, which we
cannot even hope to fill.“ And even
as he spoke, Mr. Bulger received
another long-distance request for a
teacher.

Assembly Appeal

It was because of this serious
teacher shortage that Mr. Bulger ap—
pealed to the student body a few
weeks ago in assembly, in an at-
tempt to unearth former teachers,
married or otherwise, who would be
willing to help out in the emergency.
Twelve contacts were the result of
this appeal.

'I'hc call of industry with its al—
most legendary "time and one-half,
and double time" is but one of the
causes of the present teacher short-
age. The draft, cnlistmcnts, and
marriage are also important draining
influences on the existing teacher
situation, And then, the source of
teacher supply (teacher-training
students), is dwindling. Students
are leaving college before certifies—-
lion, because of the draft and be—
cause of thoughts of the wages paid
industrial workers. In this manner,
both tltc present and future supply
of teachers is lessening.

Industrial Arts Teachers

Breaking down the bars against
married teachers is bttt one of the
means that princtpals and state edu—
cators are using in an attempt to
provide an adequate teaching staff
for the schools. According to a re-
cent newspaper article, persons who
have had five years experience in
industry and who are willing to
undertake a certain short course are
being temporarily certified to leach
industrial arts. There has been much
agitation to raise the level of teacher
salaries itt another attempt to hold
teachers in their positions against
the lure of industry and the army.

Wcrc graduated from NYSC'I‘ last
June, llif) wcnt ittto teaching posi—
tions; (ll into the army. and 44 into

Mr. Patti Bulgcr

 

Club 46 to Meet;
Panel Scheduled

The first meeting of Club '46, the
SCA organization for freshmen, will
be held next Thursday, at 7:30
P. M., in the Lounge. There will be
a panel discussion on etiquette in
general.

A complete reorganization is being
conducted within SCA. Instead of
the separate committee meetings,
general meetings will be held twice
a month in the evening at which
the programs which would formerly
have been offered at the committee
meetings will be presented. The
first of these meetings will be field
on November 18.

BOA is planning a series of
:z,.cakers for their general meet—
ings. Paul Harris, well—known news
commentator, is scheduled for an
appearance. In December they hope
to present Mrs. Way-sung-New, of
Shanghai, China, who will speak on
China in reconstruction. In March,
SCA plans to obtain Miss Ruth Sea-
bury, Christian Internationalist.

There will be a special marriage
meeting at which Dr. Caroline
Croasdale. professor of Hygiene, will
speak. Later in the year, SCA wil
present a speaker on marriage from
an..ther college.

 

War Council Pleads Return
Of Stolen Air Raid Signs

Women Keep Right, Men This
Way, or ’l‘o Locker Room, while
they make for humor when
placed lit sotncone's private
rootn, are needed where they
were placed by Ilte War Activ-
ities Council for aid raid drills.

Uttiil such time as revamp-
ing of the builJing, or some
similar cttstaslrophc takes place,
these directional signs were
meant to remain in their posi—
tions pcrmanently.

'l‘hc urge to rentch them for
personal use is great, but their
need is greater in directing stu—
dents during air raid drills. Dr.
Minnie B. Scotland, Assistant
Professor of Biology, promise.
that aftcr the war is won, any
one mttv have them for souven-
irs. But with this comes the
plea, "Until then, let lltettt slay!"

 

Forum Poll Discloses Student Opinion

The investigation titio the annex

in the State College News and car—
ried on by a committee headed by
President Sayles, has the almost
complete backing of the students.
()nly Alli voted against it.

If lllc studcnt body has its way,
the lights will come on again for
night study iii the library. A tita—
jority of 3515 votes supports tltc rc-
qucsi to that effect made by the
Stnlc College NEWS ttbottl IWo
weeks ago.

Changing horses lll mid—stream
may be dangerous lntl according lo
the poll State is not afraid of that.
If lhcy are a consensus of national
opinion, President Franklin Roose-
velt will ttot be the first man lo
run as presidential candidate and
win an election for a fourlh lcrtn.

Science will predominate in Page
Hall tomorrow morning at 10 a. in.
when the American Physical So-
ciety of New York State will hold
its fall meeting. Dr. John M. Sayles,
President of the college, will open
the program with an address of wel-
come. Recent developments in
fluorescent materials, electron dif—
fraction studies, the creep of metals,
and the million—volt industrial X-ray
unit are among the topics which will
be discussed by representatives from
the General Electric Company. A
luncheon will be served in Sayles
Hall to those who have made lunch-
eon reservations. The day’s activ-
ities will be continued in Room 317,
Albany High School. There elec-
troplating will be demonstrated, and
other discussions will concern the
evolution of color vision, electron
microscope studies, and social im-
plications of physics. These will be
presented by members of other elec-
trical corporations and a professor
from Cornell University.

The local committee on program
and arrangements consists of E. L.
Manning, State Education Depart—
ment; F. J. Studer, Union College;
and C. L. Andrews, New York State
College for Teachers.

The meeting will be open to
all students free of charge. “The
material to be discussed will prove
of great value to those taking
courses in Physics," Dr. Sayles
stated.

The purpose of this meeting will
be to further acquaint the public
with the new inventions and devel-
opments in the line of physics as
applied to electricity.

last week‘s State College NEWS.

 

The following is a picture of
State College in the year of 1944. It
is not a prediction, not fiction, nor
is it superstitution. It is merely
the result of multitudinous students
receiving letters beginning, “The
President of the United State Greets
You.” Or the malfunctioning of the
draft board.

Dr. Dorwaldl and Coach Hatﬁeld
will be enjoying their first retire-
ment checks, Miss Futterer still
looking for a play without male
parts.

Campus fraternities will be
taken over by the feminine element,
and given a few appropriate new
touches. KDR's cellar tavern will
be decorated with frilly pink cur—
tains and embroidered table cloths.
The bar will be used to concoct
beverages even tnorc original than
those of today's vie parties. The
hearts of lonely State gals will
flutter once more as the camera on

1942 College football games. “Those
were the days of men,” they'll sigh,
and a reminiscing part will follow
when the former heroes of the
Purple and Gold will be recalled in
their glory. ‘

In Potter Club feminine taste will
end the frequent decorating of State
Street with blue and red bed covers
out for an airing. The forceful
dunking of members in the bathtub
will be replaced by bubble baths,
taken willingly. The fraternity
piano will resound to a delicate
rendering of some sonata instead of
the proverbial Indian War Dance.

The white front of SLS's house
will be draped with a huge service
flag, an enlargement on today’s'with
its 30 stars. “Hi, Crud," will no
longer be a password since the gals
will dust well under the beds and—
nO more pants cuffs.

The old KB house will be occu-
pied once more. But feminine rule
will discontinue many of the old
practices. Beer cans will no longer
be thrown from the Tower Suite.
The gals will use empty perfume
bottles.

But they will be waiting for the
then to return, for they realize that
though you can't do much with men,
you can't do anything without them.

 

Slate Males Become Men “my
Much to Delight of Femmcs

"Okay, boys, over the top!" says
Coach Hatfield, and they're off to
a racing start. Hurdle one, hurdle
two, climb an eight foot wall, roll
on the ground, walk a plank, walk
another plank, and then look around
and see how tnany fellows fell by
the wayside. To your sttrprisc. you
are the only one to finish tltc course!
You start to shout your victory,
when suddenly the stars come out,
you hear strange music, attd all is
blackness.

Yes, the girls are there cheering
you on, bovs, while you go through
the “toughening up" process known
as the "commando course" This
is destined to change State men
into State MEN, and the women
gaze with ill-concealed delight while
the fellows drip sweat.

Dean's Office Denies Rumor
