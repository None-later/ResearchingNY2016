mmando Loop
cola a meeting yesterday afternoon
MAA discussed the probabilities of
forming a new intramural league,
the teams of which will compete in
running the now completed com-

ndo course. _
mel‘he men of the college Will be
taking commando training, regard-
less and an intramural league would
certainly create a competitive spirit.
Five or six men will most likely
comprise a commando squad.

The league will of course, be
handled by Intramural Council. The
time when team meets can be play-
ed may be an obstacle. However,
this can be easily overcome if the
members of each team attend .the
same gym class. This will allevxate
the difﬁculty which is encountered
in other intramural sports, where
same team members are unable to
participate because of late classes,
labs, or other activities. Moreover,
when two teams compete with each
other, both squads need not be
necessarily present. One team could
run over the course in the morning
and its men timed, while another
could be timed in the afternoon.
then the recorded times of the in-
dividuals be compared and scored.
Intercollegiate Commando?

Coach Hatfield also has plans for
telephone meets with the nearby col-
leges as RPI, Siena and; Union, all of
whom have standard size commando
courses similar to that constructed in
back of Draper.

As yet no attempt have been made
to contact State’s neighboring col-
leges. The commando course here
is comparatively new and we have
not had an opportunity to form a
group or team which will be strong
enough for inter-collegiate competi—
tion. HOWCVer, with practice work-
outs in gym classes or the intra-
mural league a fairly strong squad
could be developed to compete with
other colleges. The men running
the course in the fastest time will
undoubtedly represent the Purple
and Gold in intercollegiate competi-
tion.

Plenty of Spirit

Although the opening contest for
the basketball season is still one
month away, the varsity aspirants
have settled to serious practice ses-
sions. After watching the boys go
through their paces we were well
pleased with the spirit of the squad
as a whole.

This main factor, which had been
partly lacking in previous years, is
present in over-abundance this sea-
son. We certainly hope that such
enthusiasm and desire to win will
continue to be an integral part of
all State squads, not only for this
year but also in future years.

Closing Park Courts
Stymies Fresh Tourney

Since the nets at the Washington
 "; . ii' i"." llf‘t‘J taken down,
thtrz- i: linlc hope that the Frosh
tennis tourney will be completed
this semester. liowcver, chairman
Harry Kcnsky plans to have the
remaining matches played off next
spring.

As in last year's tournament, the
difliculty has been in getting con-
testants to arrange to meet their
opponents. This year, it was especial-
ly difficult as most of the fresh-
men wcrc working Saturdays and
had little time to play during the
school week. Many of the men
were also playing inli'annn'al foot-
ball, and this activity took one or
LWo afternoons from their spare
time.

STATE COLLEGE NEWt, FRIDAY, NOVEMBER 6, .1942
Captains Select All-State Team;

To Tie for Third
As Season Ends

Ramblers Win First;
Trojans Forfeit to SL3

In a savagely—fought game last
Monday, that saw two men, Chil-
lemi and Gerber, forced to leave the
ﬁeld because of injuries, KB turned
its long-range guns against Dorm B
and came away a 19-0 victor.

In the ﬁrst quarter a Stolbof—to-
Kensky pass from midﬁeld put KB
on their opponent’s 10-yard line. A
running play pushed the ball to the
ﬁve and then Stolbof shot a pass to
L. Flax over the middle for the telly.

In the third quarter another
Stolbof—to-Kensky pass from mid-
ﬁeld put the ball on the Shiek 5,
from which point in two plays, KB
scored on an end run by Levin.

KB’s ﬁnal tally came in the last
period, when Stolbof passed to Levin
who, behind good blocking by L.
Flax, raced half the length of the
field to the goal-line.

In its second game this week, KB
ran up against a spread offense
thrown at it by a rejuvenated
Rambler team, and lost 19—14. This
was thc Ramblers first win of the
season.

Ramblers Click

Starting with the opening kick-
off", the Ramblers moved steadily
down the field on basketball tactics
and scored on a Braun-to—Duncan
pass. KB’s own tricky offense was
met by an effective Rambler defense,
and, until the closing minute of the
first half, the latter’s goal line was
uncrossed. Then, with the Ramb-
lers threatening again, Swire picked
a booblcd Rambler lateral out of the
air on the KB three and raced the
remaining distance to a touchdown.

The second half was a replica of
the first. Plays from the spread Of—
fense put the ball on the KB three
from which point Braun ran over
for a 13-7 lead. Near the end of the
third quarter, a Duncan pass to Mc—
Laren clicked for the final Rambler
score.

Mixing a speedy ground game
with sharp passes and successfully
defending their goal—line against a
surprisii'igly hard-running Dorm B
sextet, the Finks closed their season
last Tuesday by taking their second
victory of the year, 25-0.

After stopping a Shiek threat on
their own 10, the Finks, relying al—
most entirely on their ground game,
moved the bail to the Dorm l3 five,
from which point Olivct threw to
Dunning for the pay-oil".

The Shicks, with Porcino block-
ing and Wall carrying, constantly
thrcalcncd to break loose, but the
l"inl;:; held on and lead at half~tinie,
7-~o.

Second Half Slaughter

In the third quarter, Mennillo
passes set up runs by Olivct and
Tucker to bring the Finks knocking
at the door again. Olivct tallied on
a pass from Tucker to increase the
Pink lead to thirteen points.

Seconds later, the Finks struck
again as Mennillo pounced on a free
ball in the Shick end-zone following
the next kick—off.

In the final period, ()’[.cary intcr—
ceptcd a Dorm B desperation pass
on the latter's 10, and Olivct passed
again for a touchdown.

Failure of Dorm A to field a team
last Monday when it was scheduled
to meet 51...“. gave the latter a for—
feit victory and second place in the
final standings of the year.

For Varsity Five

The first week of basketball prac—

with both teams still indefinite and
no cuts having been made. 'Ap—
proximately 15". of the male popu-
lation has put in its appearance at
the Page Hall va at afternoon ses-
sions, and since only twenty will be
kept the competition has been and
will be keen.

The annual All-State football poll
of the captains of each team in the
intramural football league was made
this week following the completion
of the last games of the season.

On the first team, Potter Club, in-
tramural football champions landed
two representatives, Hansen, end,
and Evans, in the backﬁeld. Dorm
A also placed two, Cummings, the
other end, and Tassoni, another
backﬁeld man. Capel, of SLS, at
center, and Levin, of: KB, backﬁeld,
complete the outﬁt.

Each captain named his choices
for a ﬁrst and second All-State
squad based, of course, on perform-
ances during the past campaign,
and results were tabulated allowing
two points for each ﬁrst team nom—
ination and one point for each sec-
ond team nomination.

Botfi end positions were taken as
a unit, so that it was possible for
two left ends to be named to the
ﬁrst squad, as did happen. The
three positions in the backfield were
also taken as a unit; in other words,
of all the backs named, the top three
in total points were named to the
All-State ﬁrst team. Consequently,
the backfield positions and players
as arranged below do not necessarily
correspond correctly, but. the three
players named do hold bcrths in the
All-State backfield.

 

Dorm A, Potter Place Two Each

  

No one received an unanimous
vote in this year’s balloting. Red
Evans, and Frank Hansen, however,
received ﬁfteen out of a possible
sixteen points to lead all players
mentioned.

Hansen, EEP RE

Soph Women Win Hockey Game

Last Wednesday the Soph girls
added three points to their class
rivalry score by defeating the fresh-
men girls in hockey to the tune of
3-1. The Sophomores scored two
points in the first half and another
in the second while the one Frosh
goal came in the second half. A
game which was held Friday, Oc—
tober 31, ended in a 1-1 tie neces-
sitating Wednesday's playoff.

Rivalry score, as a result of the
hockey game now stands at 9-2
in favor of the Sophomores.

Rienow Answers
Charges Against
War Activities

Student Body Displays
Lack of Cooperation

Because of the numerous com-
plaints of various members of the
student body concerning the actiVi-
ties of War Council, Dr. Robert
Rienow, Assistant Professor of Soc1al
Studies, and one of the faculty mem-
bers on War Council has decided to
answer these complaints all at once.

Council Assembles Suggestions

The War Council of State College
is a purely administrative body. It
is a clearing-house for all the ideas
and suggestions of the student body
about the war activities at State. It
was not created to control the stu—
dents in any way; but to co-ordinate
their ideas and make them practical.
Many students have entirely mis-
understood War Council; this should
correct their impressions. Every-
thing should be student initiated.
Each student organization should
have a representative at War Coun-
cil meetings on alternate Thursdays
at 8 A. M. and Wednesdays at 4:30
P. M.; in fact, the representatives
should be “clamoring for action!"

Because of this lack of co-opera—
tion by the student body, War
Council has formulated some plans
for further war work without con-
sulting the students.
Scrap and Rubber Collected

First of all, there is a plan afoot
to make the fraternity and sorority
houses into V homes. That is to
make sure that all the available rub—
ber has been turned in and that
there is a minimum of waste all
around.

Then a criticism was made by a
member of War Council concerning
the writing of letters to men in the
armed services by members of va-
rious sororities. It was stated that
the project is not sufficiently organ-
iZed or distributed widely enough to
be known as an All-State affair.
Sewing Projects Underway

The Stamp Booth has been put up,
and so far has been quite successful.
The Sewing and Knitting Groups
under the supervision of Katherine
Cousins, '43, and Patricia Frey, '44,
have begun their work. They meet
in Milne because there is no place
for them to meet in Draper under
proper supervision. It was suggested
that sorority houses, fraternity
houses and the various group houses
begin sewing projects of their own.
There are 45 girls at present who
are working at the Albany Hospital
as Nurscs' Aides.

War Council has finally come to
an agreement as to uniform arrange-

Music Council

TO PresentRevue

Studebaker, Ryan Write
Gay Nineties Production

The Gay Nineties Revue, a Music
Council production, is already being
hailed as one of the big musical
events of the second semester. It
is unique in that it was written by
two State College students about
State College students and will be
enacted by State College students.
Mary Studebaker and Rhona Ryan,
the authors, chose for their setting
the State Normal College in 1894.
The plot will consist of some actual
incidents in the history of our col—
lege padded with plenty of Gay
Nineties songs and banter. There
will be a superﬁuity of bustles and
bow-ties, rufiles and striped jackets.
To make it authentic the playwrights
have even conducted a detailed re-
search to ferret out the most fash-
ionable Horatio Alger slang of the
day.

The show will be strictly local
talent. Men's tryouts were Tuesday
and the principal roles were given
to the following: James McFeeley
Harley Dingman, Harold Goldstein,
Edward Krupp, Curtis Pfafi, Robert
Loucks, Ned Timpane, Paul Barsclou
and Daniel Reagan. Tryouts for
women were held after the News
went to press. Rehearsals will begin
in earnest next week.

Mrs. Bulger has been drafted to
direct the dance routines. Dr. Cand-
lyn and Helen Elgin are in charge
of music and Dr. Jones and Dr.
McIlwaine will supervise everything
in general.

The proceeds from the show will
be given over to War Relief as a
contribution of Music Council.

Music Council Elects
Southwick Treasurer

Music Council recently elected
Jane Southwick, '44, to ﬁll the va—
cant position of treasurer. In order
to do this, the council was forced
to amend their present constitution.

According to the constitution
whoever fills the position of treas—
urer must have had a year's experi—
ence in the Council. Al the present
time there is no one thus qualified
who could take the position since
all the potential applicants already
hold major positions. The consti-
tution was amended to the effect
that in case of such an emergency
as now exists, a student who did
not have a year's experience may
be chosen. All major positions in
Music Council are now filled.

Campus Chest Extends Drive;
Additional Funds Needed

“As things stand, it will be
impossible to meet our budget,
and as a result the deserving or-
ganizations that are in dire need
of funds will suffer," declared
Sol Greenberg, '43, chairman of
Campus Chest Committee.

As far as can be determined
at present, tabulations show that
students have not contributed in
suﬂicicnt amounts to fulﬁll the
expectations of the committee.
In addition, there are numerous
cases in which no contributions
have been received.

In an effort to partially make
up the deﬁcit, the official date
of the campaign has been ex-
tended until today at 5 P. M.
As originally planned, the cam-
paign would have been com-
pleted last Tuesday.

Students who have not yet
made contributions and who
wish to do so are urged to con-
suit any of the solicitors or Sol
Greenberg.

Forum Will Show

Motion Pictures

Forum's motion pictures on the
war effort originally scheduled for
last Wednesday will be presented at
this week's meeting in the Lounge
at 3: 30 P. M. It is expected that three
ﬁlms will be shown: one on tanks,
another on army training, and a
third on getting wings in the Army
Air Corps.

Included in the meeting will be
the report and discussion of the An-
nex committee's investigation.

Forum also issues an appeal for
those interested in the Hi-Y model
assembly to contact Verna Snyder,
’43. This will be held sometime in
the Spring in the New York State
Assembly chambers.

The United Nations dance, which
was originally planned for this sem-
cslcr but postponed because of con-
flict with fraternity rush parties, will
be held next semester. It is possible
that this event will take place on the
night of Moving—up Day.

in relation to Forum’s proctor sys—
tem, any person who desires credit
for Forum work should contact some
board member. Each will then take
a group and organize the individual's
work.

 

lntervarsity to Sponsor Rally

The lntcrvursity, the new chapter
of an international Christian Fellow~
ship organization, invites everyone
to a good time at its rally held at the
Y. W. C. A. tomorrow night. The
festivities will Silll'f at 8 P. M. Ac-
cording to Ruth Shanly, '43, Presi-
dent, tlicrc is no admission charge
except “a cheerful countenance."

 

Etchings and Punch Combine to Make Hogner Lecture 0 Success

 

 

The lounge was packed. Some
people were there to taste the
punch: others were there to hear a
speech. But nearly everyone had
come with one aim primarily: to see
the etchings of Nils Hogner.

On two large screens by the fire-
place were original drawings and
illustrations. The artists of State
College viewed the masterpieces
with the speculative accuracy of
connoisseurs "Fine line; tremendous
form."

Others were instinctively ini-
prcsscd by the liveliness and anima-
tion of the characters.

As always, there were the gapcrs
--—who gapcd,

But chryone, regardless of his
artistic background, could not help
but perceive the fine quality and in—
dividuality of the illustrations. In
black and white, there were no tWo
alike. The few colorful book illus-
trations were an interesting contrast.

Although caricatures or animals
Were predominant, the straight
sketches of people were as polished

By Sunna Cooper

and as highly enjoyable. In every
work, the artist seemed to develop
a mood. in the sketch of the fisher-
wonien, dcspoiidciicy was achieved
through the droop of shoulders and
the dull colors. It is interesting to
note that in this picture, the artist
did not rely on faces for expression.
I‘lc conceived the effect he desired
with the backs of the characters
turncd away,

So much for the etchings.

Since he was a lecturer as \vcll as
an artist, he lectured. l'lis manner
was charming. There was a boyish—
ncss and earnestness about him
which captivated all. To evci'yonc‘s
amazement, hc sketched as he
talked. But his sketching far out-
shone his speaking.

Perhaps it was modesty, but Mr.
Hogner scarcely mentioned himself
or his fascinating experiences. How—
ever, he does have something in
common with all students (or is
it profs) of State, having himself
played a part in the teaching pro-
fession. For four years, he taught

in the University of New Mexico.

He is a man of great Versatility.
Not only has he built his own home,
i'ccniisll'uclcd his automobile, but
he has also delved into the cul~
innry field. He can cook, and his
concoctions actually turn out. (See
Mrs. llogncr for further verifica—
tion).

Early in life, the lure of travel
cnptlvulcd him. Not only has he
“soon America first," but he has
truvoled and studied in many for-
eign countries as well.

At the close of his lecture and
exhibition, Mr. llogner autographed
books and picturcs in his usual
unassuming manner, his sincere
geniality.

Art plays an important part in
any background: college, business,
the home. One does not have to be
an artist to appreciate the finer
things. Culture is not born within
a person; it is acquired. Nils Hog—
ner‘s lecture and illustrations com-
prise one more step in the right
direction.

Sub-Committee Appointed
For an¢$ii§1ti0n of Annex

 

New Chem Ldb
Nearly Finished

Three More Weeks Needed

For Installation of Equipment

“When it is ﬁnished,” said Dr.
Oscar E. Lanford, Professor of
Chemistry, “we will have as modern
a laboratory as can be bought, and
it will be as ﬁne as any in the
country. It will be absolutely up
to date and complete."

This is the picture of the new
Chemistry laboratory, which, when
installed in three weeks, will pro-
vide students with one of the best
laboratories in the country. Al-
though the $17,000 worth of equip-
ment was purchased several months
ago, it arrived only last week, and
the engineer will start installation
this week. The delay was due to
war priorities.

Rooms 251, 252, 256 and the stock
room in Huested Hall will receive
the major part of the equipment.
In room 251, new center tables will
be installed, and fume hoods for the
walls will be put up. Room 252
will receive practically the same
quantity of new furniture. In
room 256 there will be a wall table,
fume hood, and control temperature
water bath. Two storage cabinets
also will be placed in this room.

The stock room, 254, will have
a fume hood, center table, and serv-
eral storage cabinets. Hitherto the
stock room did not have these
pieces, so they will not be replace-
ments in this case.

Another important addition will
be an air compressor in the base-
ment. This will decrease the pos-
sibility of explosion occuring from
nearby ﬂame, as the compressed air
will be obtained from a faucet on
the tables, as is water and gas.
The tables in room 252 will be furn-
ished with steam outlets in the
same manner.

This new equipment is the re-
sult of an appropriation made by the
legislature in April. It marks part
of a program for improvement of the
college which included terrazzo
floors, various repairs, and land-
scaping around the dormitories.

Literary Publications

Announce Late Plans

Rolf 'l‘oepfer, '43, editor of the
1042-43 State College Director an-
nounces that it will be “of' the
presses" on Novomber 18. He also
reminds students that galley proofs
are in the lower half of Draper
“all. They should be consulted and
any necessary corrections reported
to the stuff. The freshman staff
for the current Directory includes
Mary E. LaFuro, Stuart Beycrl,
Douglas Barnum mid Agnes Young.
They were appointed by Student
Council.

Two of the other publications
of the college, the i’cdagoguc and
the as yet unnamed literary animal
are preparing for publication. Jean
Tracy, '43, editor of the PL’tfﬂf/OUUL’,
announces that. proofs for “Pod”
pictures absolutely must the back

SEB Requests Senior Pictures

All Seniors and graduate students
who are interested in securing pic-
tures for SEB should go to the Cen-
tral Studio, 181 Central Avenue.
The price will be two dollars for
nine pictures.

Groups to Collaborate
With Cafeteria's Head

At ‘the second meeting of the
committee for investigation of An-
nex and Cafeteria conditions last
Monday, several recommendations
and policies were voted upon, and a
sub-committee was appointed for
the purpose of deciding if these
resolutions were of practical value,
and if so, how they could best be
applied.

Dr. Robert
Reinow, Assistant
Professor of Social
Studies, was des-
ignated chairman
of this sub-com—
mittee. The other
members are Dr.
Minnie B. Scot-
land, Assistant
Professor of Biol-
ogy, Bernard
l)r.|tlcnow Skolsky, ’44, and

Natalie Mann,
Milne. This group will concern
itself with facts, ﬁgures and solu-
tions, acting upon and making prac-
tical the decisions of the main com-
mittee. They will consult with Miss
Laura Thompson, director of the
Annex and Cafeteria.

It was recommended at the main
committee meeting that improve-
ment be made in the calibre of the
Annex sandwiches; that is, that the
sandwiches be made of uniform and
satisfactory size and quantity; that
the ﬁlling be spread more evenly;
that the bread be fresh; that the
sandwiches be entirely cut; in other
words, that much more supervision
be given to the making of sand-
wiches.

Lower Milk Price

Another suggestion was that the
price of milk be reduced to the
lowest possible point, as Milne stu-
dents feel that more would buy milk
if it were $.05.

If this is not possible, it might be
practical to raise the price of less
essential products such as candy
and cake so that milk might be made
available to all students.

More Atmosphere in Anich

It was also suggested that the
physical conditions of the Annex
and Cafeteria might be changed,
so that the room will be more
inviting to lunchers. Another sug-
gestion was that the menu of the
Cafeteria be streamlined so as to
include only sandwiches, soups, and
one hot dish.

The sub-committee will act on
these suggestions in collaboration
with Miss Thompson and will pre-
pare a report to submit to the main
committee at a later meeting. They
hope to work out a program which
will be satisfactory to the customers,
and still insure a reasonable profit
from the sales.
