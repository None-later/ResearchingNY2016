' ‘tlli‘d'r' most people, the intramural
football season is past and forgotten

" diver ‘as State College. is concerned.
-' Hoyt/ever," this. year’s football cam-
-v‘~-‘paig'n'is not so easily eclipsed from
 f the minds of. two. intramural foot-
 = ball. players lying in a bed in Albany

Hospital. The .two. men, “Moose”-

3'" - TGerber and“ Terry: Smyth, head a
 . -~large list of injured. players during

», the past season. .

.With the exception of Gerber .and
Smyth, the injuries were of a minor
nature and everyone is back to
normal physical condition. These
two, however, had to be removed
to a hospital to undergo operations.

" " ,With hospitals come huge hos—

“pital bills and this creates quite
a problem to the whole of_ State
College. The total hospitalization
and 'doctor bills for the two students
amount to about $250. This ex-
ce‘e‘ds by far MAA’s usual inﬁrmary
fund of $300. Therefore, under
present conditions it is impossible
for MAA to pay the hospital bill.

Funds Lacking

This is the’ ﬁrst time that such
a situation has presented itself in
the college. Previous injuries to
students participating in athletic
events have been minor ones, and
within the limit of MAA’s intirmary
fund. In fact, every year the ath—
letic Council has been returning
most of the $300 of its infirmary
fund back to the Student Association
surplus.

It is true that students partici-
pate in intramural sports voluntarily.
However, we feel that it will be un-
fair to let the students pay the bill.
The student body as a whole can
pay it a lot easier than can the
private families of the two injured
students. MAA-has promised to pay
$150 of the bill, but this amount falls
short by a large margin.

Under present conditions there is
no other agency with the exception
of the .budget surplus, through
which the money could be obtained.
The surplus is to be used in case
of emergencies. If this isn’t an
emergency, we would like to know
what is.

A motion to obtain this money
will have to be made in Assembly.
When this is done, let every student
cast his vote with this in mind:
.How Would you vote if you were
in thelhospital bed instead of Gerber
or Smyth‘.’

What of the Future?

State College was caught flat-
footed when the two students suf—
fered major injuries. Such a situ-
ation-..cannot be allowed to happen
again. With special emphasis placed
on‘physical fitness in the college, es-
pecially the commando course and
more spirited gym classes and in-
tramural contests, the chances of
injuries have increased appreciably.
Steps must be taken to insure
that enough money is being set aside
to provide for such casulties.

We Would like to suggest that
MAA and WAA be empowered to
start a combined infirmary fund so
that if any college man or women
is injured in athletic events, funds
are available to take care of any
hospital bills. One way of starting
this fund may be to put gthc re-
"mains of each year’s infirmary
quota into this combined fund un—
til an arbitrary amount is reached.
say $1000.

Another suggestion may be to
investigate the possibilities of in—
suring the students participating in
sports. The premiums could be
divided proportionally and paid by
MAA, WAA and the college admin-
lstralion. The administration is in-
cluded because we believe that
everyone who is taking gym should
be insured if it's financially possible.

I-M Race Meet
.WOn by Guarino,
Tucker Second

,By virtue of his victory in the
ﬁnal heat of the 80-yard dash, the
main event of last week’s intra—
mural meet, Gene Guarino was pro-
claimed the fastest man in the I—M
football league. This meet, the ﬁrst

' of its kind ever held at State, took

place on the Page Hall ﬁeld. It was
sponsored by Bart Kiley through
Intramural Council for the purpose
of determining the fastest man, the
best place-kicker and punter, and

a the longest and most accurate passer
. in the league.

Nosing out Bill Tucker by a two-

‘ yard margin, Guarino won the title -

of the fastest man in the Intramural
League. Dave Griffin took third
place. Tucker beat Tassoni in the
first heat, turning in the fast time
of 9.2 seconds. Griffin won the sec-
ond heat over Guarino in 9.4 seconds.
The ﬁnal heat was run in 9.5 sec-
onds. Frank Hansen, one of the
pre-race favorites, was nosed out in
the ﬁrst heat.

Rich Young booted the oval
sphere 57 yards 2 feet and 9 inches
to win the kicking contest. Johnny
Sussina with a boot of 51 yards 2
feet and 8 inches placed second in
the event.

Place-kicking the ball 41 yards,
Joe Tassoni nosed out Rich Young
whose best try was 40 yards.

Fay Welch tossed one into the
basket to defeat all rivals in the
accuracy-passing contest.

Triple threat man Tassoni, who
did quite well in each of the four
contests, climaxed an “on” day by
winning the long distance passing
contest. His best heave was good
for 51 yards. Ernie Mennillo and
Red Evans tied for second place,
each getting a toss of 48 yards.

Chess Club Sponsoring
New Membership Drive

A movement is now underway in
the undergraduate body to revive
the Chess Club, an organization
which has gathered fame to its name
in years past with its impressive
victories.

At present Jim Wahler and Clar-
ence Oarr are seaking out possible
members to form a new nucleus to
replace the fine players lost in last
June’s graduation. Plans are un-
der way to hold meetings and dis-
cussions on play, as well as to give
aid to any who may lack sufﬁcient
skill or experience.

An initial step in this direction
came in the form of a match be—
tween Sayles Hall and SLS players
a week ago yesterday which ended
in a draw, each team winning three
games. It is hoped that similar
meetings between other groups will
uncover more talent and lend im—
petus to the movement.

Any student who might be inter-
ested or desires further details
should consult Oarr or Wahler as
soon as possible so that the ground-
work may be started immediately.

Tennis Tourney Incomplete

The closing of the Washington
Park courts has made completion
of the WAA tennis tournament im—
possible, and the remaining three
matches will be played in the spring.

The main factors of the delay were
poor weather conditions and the in-
ability of the contestants to arrange
the playoffs of their matches. Alsq
the tournament got off to a later start
than last year's.

it is expected that the semi—
linalists will complete their matches
and that the victor will secure the
cup as soon as the courts are again
opened.

It Could
Be

Wurz

 

 

At this point there are few things
so intriguing to the women of State
as the Commando course. While
most of the girls are content merely
to talk about it, three intrepid souls
decided to try it. Flo Garfall,
leader of the Sophs, Marie DeChene,
glamorous sports writer, and Peggy
Bostwick, dynamic mite, appropri-
ately clad in faded dungarees and
plaid shirts, set out to try their
luck.

So the three lined up to take the
hurdles. Up and over went Garfall
and DeChene—up but not over
went Bostwick. Peggy, never giv-
ing up, climbed the hurdles in a
fashion hardly approved in the
best Commando circles.

Up and Over

The wall presented the real prob-
lem to our lady Commandos. Once,
twice, three, four times they tried
to mount it. No luck. Then they
went into a huddle and decided to
boost Bostwick to the top of the
wall. So Dee and F10 lifted Peggy
to the top. Then the mighty Gar-
fall braced herself and made the top
by her own power. Dee, with as—
sistance from above and below,
soon joined her pals. “Let’s wait
here a moment or two,” gasped Flo,
“just until I start breathing again.”
So they rested, perched gingerly on
the narrow top. Then down they
jumped, at least F10 and Peg did,
but Dee insisted that she was stuck
and would never be able to get
down. But at last, she too, hit
the ground and the three completed
the course.

The Woman's View

“What do you think about it?” we
asked. “What do you mean—what
do we think about it—are you kid-
ding?" said Dee. “I’ll never be able
to walk again.” “I don’t think that
it would give any man in the college
any trouble,” was Garfall's contri-
bution. Bostwick just groaned.

On the next day all three of our
Women Commandos said that as far
as they were concerned, the Com-
mando course could be given to the
men, but permanently.

WAA Fall Program
Rolls Along Smoothly

There is not much new going on
in the feminine sports world. The
various sports offered by WAA are
all running smoothly.

Julie Clark, captain of riding, has
announced a new policy. Riding
credit can now be obtained at any
time throughout the year, by having
the stable manager write a note ad-
dressed to June Clark stating that
you have ridden.

The end of the fall sports season
and the beginning of the winter
sports season occurs at Thanksgiv—
ing. So, check up and see that
you have your fall sports credit,
there's still time to finish tip an
incompleted sport. And get ready
to enjoy the winter sports which
include swimming, basketball, bowl—
ing. ping-pong, ice—skating, and of
course, weekends at Camp John-
ston.

Hatfield Attends
NYC Conference

Last Thursday and Friday Coach
G. Elliot Hatﬁeld attended a joint
Armed Forces conference in New
York City. This conference was
held by the Army, Navy and Air
Force in order to acquaint physical
instructors of the various colleges
and universities with what training
the undergraduate men students are
expected to receive. Coach Hatﬁeld.
in his capacity as physical director
of the men of State College, repre-
sented this institution.

In general, the ideas outlined at
the conference are already in use
here. The different methods of ob-
taining the best results in the short
times allotted in most college curri-
eulas were discussed. Coach Hat-
ﬁeld brought back a list of recom-
mended calisthenics, and plans to
use them in the gym classes. Run~
ning was shown to be the best
conditioner for stamina and long-
windedness.

Military training, it was empha-
sized, is not desired in the colleges.
If the student is in good physical
condition when he enters the Army,
his military training can be much
shorter and easier. Training in co—
ordination and timing, however, such
as can be obtained by running over
an obstacle course similar to that
which State has, is desirable.

  

Varsity Cagers‘
Sforf Scrimmage

The second week of varsity bas—
ketball practice brought about few
changes, except for the smoothing
out of the technical defects in the
candidates. The drilling on passing
and other fundamentals is bearing
fruit, as evidenced by the disap—
pearance of the erratic passes and
faulty dribling which characterized
the earlier sessions.

An innovation in the past week
was the start of the scrimmage
practices. Strong emphasis is still
placed on the fast break ﬁgure
eight offense, and the man to man
defense.

All of last year's lettermen in
school at the present time are out,
with the exception of Combs and
Gerber, who are still on the in-
jured list. However, Combs is ex-
pected to be able to go very shortly.
Gerber’s chances of being allowed
to return are considered very slim.

After a good showing earlier in
the year, freshmen candidates were
noticably lacking last week, no more
than two being present for any
one practice.

Since there are only a total of
two and a half weeks remaining for
practice before the ﬁrst contest, with
the break for Thanksgiving vaca—
tion coming right in the middle,
Coach Hatﬁeld has plans for some
strenuous sessions to come.

NEWS Elects
Six Sophomores

To Desk Positions

Board Also Chooses
Business, Sports Staff:

The Board of the STATE COLLEGE
News released this morning the re-
sults of the election held this week
to determinr- which of the competing
reporters should succeed to the
positions of Sophomore Desk Edi-
tors. Others were also elected to
the Sophomore Sports and Business
Staffs.

The Desk Editors for the year
1942—43 are: Gordon Baskin, Sunna
Cooper, Jane Heath, J. Michael Hip—
pick, Dorothy Meyers and Barbara
Putnam. In this election, the News
reverted to its customary policy of
electing six to the Sophomore Desk.
Last year the Board created two
special positions to provide an ade-
quate working staff required for the
expanded program under which the
News operated. With six-page is—
sues necessarily eliminated this year
to a large extent, it was felt that
eight Sophomores were not needed.

Business, Sports Add to Staffs

At the same election, additions
were made to the Sports and Busi—
ness staffs.

The Junior Business Staff is com-
posed of Herman Blumel, Mary Cor-
bett, Georgia Hardesty, Carmelina
Losurdo and Jane Pickert. Clarence
Oarr is Junior Assistant Sports Edi—
tor, and Margaret Byrne is also on
the Junior Sports Staff

Lois Drury and Dorothea Smith
have been named to the Sophomore
Business Staff; Sophomore Sports-
writers are Margaret Bostwick,
Marie DeChene, John Dooley, Stan—
ley Gipp, Joan Hylind, Eugene
McLaren, Ernest Mennillo and John
Sussina. Edna Marsh and Mary
Sanderson have been appointed
Sophomore Feature Writers.

As We approach the gym, We stop
suddenly. The sound effects are
really amazing! Is that a herd of
elephants trampling back and forth?
But no, elephants don't titter and
giggle it's the girls' all right! We
go on, and as we step onto the bal—
cony, a strange sight meets our eyes.
Advancing across the floor comes the
regiment but what kind of a forma-
tion is that? It must be a new
technique, guaranteed to fool the en-
emy into believing it is ti retreat,
not an advance. Why, they even
had us fooled for a minutel How-
ever, we hate to see the girls
try anything so complicated, so We

that she by straight marching first.

“Ssslil” she replies. "That's what
they're doing!"

Willi that we retire to our corner
and remain there in Wondrous
silence for the rest of the period

“Forward, march!” barks Miss .l,
The line trcnlbles, and finally a
brave soul breaks loose and strides
forth. The rest follows her, skip—
ping constantly to keep in step
with the person on their right and
the person on their left, a task
which is virtually impossible.

“Right wheel!" Each girl does a
little maneuver of her own, and
tries to persuade everyone else to
do the same.

"Backward, march!"

“Look out, you!" "You stepped
