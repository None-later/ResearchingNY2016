Court Schedule Tough

It will be but a mere two weeks
before the varsity basketball squad
will trot out onto the Clarkson court
to inaugurate the 1942-43 basketball
campaign. This year’s schedule
promises to be as difﬁcult as any
previous one encountered by State
College quintets. I

As has been the custom in pre—
vious years, the team will open the
season away, Clarkson Tech playing
the host at Potsdam on December 4.
The Eagles will meet St. Lawrence
on the following afternoon and re-
turn to play RPI and Clarkson be-
fore the Christmas vacation. Thus
the basketball squad will play one-
third of its twelve-game schedule in
two weeks.

Besides the “Larries” and the
“Techmen” the Eagles will meet
such formidable foes as Niagara,
Brooklyn Poly, and Pratt, all of
whom boast teams of better calibre
than the Statestnen. RPI and Union
also expect strong squads for the
coming campaign. The strength of
Middlebury and St. Michael’s, the
two remaining State fees, is un-
known to us as yet, but you can well
expect that they will not be push-
overs.

Candidates Few

Colleges with a small number
of male students ﬁnd it difﬁcult to
compete in intercollegiate circles.
To this, State is no exception. Al-
most all of its opponents have many
times the number of men in this
college. Moreover, State attracts
few, if any, of the student who
played varsity basketball in their
High School career.

This year will be a unique one, as
far as basketball is concerned as it
will probably be the ﬁrst time that
Coach G. Eliot Hatﬁeld will not be
forced to cut his basketball squad.
Approximately thirty men answered
Hatﬁeld’s basketball call a few
weeks ago. The Coach planned on
keeping twenty for the varsity and
jayvees, combined. However, sev-
eral candidates have abandoned the
idea of practice, thus decreasing the
number of aspirants to about twenty.
Therefore, there will probably be no
cut this year.

The situation is serious, however.
The response for basketball was very
poor, especially so among the fresh-
men and Sophomores. The bulk of
the basketeers is comprised of Ju~
niors and Seniors;

Upperclassmen On JV

Juniors and Seniors are desirable
on the varsity but their presence on
the Junior Varsity is far from ac-
ceptable. The purpose of the Jayvee
group, as far as we can see, is to
develop players which may be of
use to the varsity in future years.
Seniors therefore, are of no import—
tant value in playing on the Jayvee.

It would be tnuch better if they
were replaced by frosh or Sophs
even though these are less experi—
enced. However, as the situation
stands this year the uppcrclass-
men cannot be replaced as there are
not enough freshmen or Sophomores
trying out for Jayvce posts. Only
three of last year’s yearlings are still
practicing, while the fresh boast a
more live aspirants, compared to at
least twelve in previous years.

McLarcn On l-M Council

Intramural Council has recently
had a change in membership. Gene
McLarcn, ‘45, replaced Bert Kiley,
'44, as representative of the ltamb-
lers. This change was due to the
fact that Kiley this year is going
to play ball with Potter rather titan
the Ramblers, making him ineligible
to represent the latter team.

 

STATE COLLEGE NEWS, FRIDAY, NOVEMBER 20, 1942
Basketball Schedule 1942-43

l-M Council Plans
Basketball Season
To Open Dec. I

Games to be Played
Each Tuesday, Thursday

Intramural Council is at present
making plans for the fall opening of
basketball. Bill Marsland and Ed
Reed are in charge of arrangements
and hope to have the ﬁrst games
played by December ﬁrst at the
latest.

According to present plans the
games will be played on Tuesday
and Thursday nights on the Page
Hall court. Two games will be
played each night; the ﬁrst begin-
ning at seven and the second get-
ting under way at eight.

The league will probably be
stronger in manpower this year due
to the emphasis put on sports in the
new athletic training and a deep
feeling of rivalry already being set
into motion by several groups.
However, a strong loss will be felt
it the College House cagers, who
have won the trophy for the past
three years, fail to enter a squad.

The number of teams is not known
deﬁnitely as yet, but at least eight,
and possibly ten, will appear. Each
“frat” is expected to display its
talent with individual teams as in
the past. The men’s Dorm will have
one team at least, and plans are
being made for a second if sufﬁcient
players respond to the call. A new
group will form an independent
team, tentatively known as the
“GDIB’s”, according to present plans.
The Finks and the Ramblers will
round out the quota, with College
House making it ten if they enter.

Captains of each of these groups
are urged to turn in their lists of
players as soon as possible to Mars—
land or Reed so that the schedule
of games may be arranged. Men
who would like to referee the games
are asked also to contact the above
two in the near future.

To those players who wish to get
in some pre-season practice, the
gym will be open tomorrow after—
noon from one to ﬁve. A large num-
ber of men are expected to take
advantage of this chance.

MAA lProbes

Player Insurance

MAA council is now investigating
the possibilities of providing insur-
ance for varsity and intramural
athletes. The council is determined
to make some provision whereby
medical funds will be available,
should anyone be injured while par—
ticipating in any sport supervised by
MAA.

This investigation has been begun
because of the recent hospital cases
incurred in intramural football
games. Serious injuries of this type
had never before occurred, and no
one knew just exactly how to meet
the circumstances.

As explained in assembly last
week by MAA, the president, Owen
Bombard has set up in its annual
budget a fund to cover injuries to
players of varsity sports, the main
one being of course, basketball.
This fund at the beginning of the
year amounted to $300, but it has
been cut in half by the payment of
$150 toward the expenses of the
above mentioned ease. MAA has
annually turned back to Student
Association part of this fund, since
it has never before had any serious
injuries. It is now invostigating the
possibility of insuranclng athletes.
This insurance Would include intra-
mural as well as varsity players.

As yet, no definite decision has
been made, but MAA promises that
every possible means will be
thoroughly investigated and what
appears to be the most favorable will
be adopted.

Gerber Wastes No Time
With Bevy of Pretty Nurses

After kissing some ten or
eleven of his nurses goodbye,
Moose Gerber left the Albany
Hospital on Tuesday afternoon.
Along with the smear of lip-
stick, Moose could be seen sport-
ing a corset made of plaster of
paris (due to the shortage of
rubber). Moose was persuaded
to leave only after the hospital
authorities consented to let a
pretty nurse escort him home
in a doctor’s car.

Just before leaving, Moose bid
goodbye to Terry Smith, who
has been his roommate for the
past few weeks. Terry, who is
recuperating from a knee opera—
tion, will be released sometime
next week.

Basketball Squad
Dwindling Rapidly
AsHopefulsDrop

With three weeks of fundamental
drills and light scrimmages already
past, Coach Hatﬁeld has his rapidly
dwindling basketball squad practic-
ing diligently for the December 4
opener at Canton. Only about seven
more practice sessions remain before
the annual northern trip which
heads a tough schedule.

Of the thirty odd candidates who
answered Hatﬁeld’s ﬁrst call, only
twenty—two remain, permitting a
maximum cut of two men if both
varsity and junior varsity schedules
are maintained. However, there is
enough material at least for a fairly
strong varsity team headed by Han-
sen, Bora, Marsland, and Combs
who have all played regularly for
State at one time or another. Be—
sides these lettermen there are Mil-
ler, Rubacb, Lynch, Young, Flax,
and Mullin, with the possible addi—
tion of Braun.

Because of the small number of
aspirants the strength of the junior
varsity is going to depend greatly
on the strength of the varsity. The
greater number of experienced men
on the varsity, the fewer there will
be on the J. V.‘s. However, as it
stands, Kullman and Hippiek, two of
last year's fresh, and Reed, Wise.
Capel, and Asbworth, intramural
performers last year, will be left to
add experience to the spirit and
ability of the frosh, Riccardo, Ryan,
Powell, Bortnick, and Woods.

The “fast break" and shallow and
deep figure eight systems are being
stressed to provide a varying oflensu
for the Eagles players.

WAA Plans Program

At WAA's council meeting last
Thursday, the captains for the win-
ter sports were selected. They are
as foIIOWS: Lois Dann and Mary
Now, bowling; Pat Latimcr, swim-
ming; Leda LaSallc and Florence
Garfall, basketball.

The number of hours which each
student must have to obtain credit
in any single sport have not been
decided as yet and neither ltave the
specific days and periods for each
activity been arranged. The cap~
tains will make out their own pro-
grams and schedules will be posted
on the WAA bulletin board soon.

Thanksgiving vacation will end
WAA’s fall program and usher in
the winter sports. Among these are
ping-pong and bowling. We would
like to see WAA inaugurate an
Inter-house Ping-pong tourney as
well as continue last year’s success-
ful Inter-house Bowling League.

We would suggest that the Ping;-
pong,, tourney be conducted in. this
way. Let each house hold a- pre-
liminary tourney to pick a house’
champion. Then, these girls would
compete and the trophy would be
presented to the Victor’s house.

At this point, we would like to
say a word to the directors of WAA.
The manner of conducting tourneys
could be improved. The tennis
tournament might haVe been, com-
pleted this fall if the competitors
had either played matches on time or
else forfeited their right to compete.
If participants would understand
that although the tournaments are
played for fun, they are also con-
ducted according to certain rules.
the matches might have been com-
pleted on time. We would hate
to see the Bowling and Ping-pong
tourneys come to an ignominious end
and we hope they will begin as soon
as the students return from Thanks-
giving vacation. So, get a group of
your friends together, make deﬁnite
plans for the whole season and good
luck and fun to all who enter into
the spirit of the game.

Impresses Commissioner Stoddard

 

Dr. George D. Stoddard, Commis—
sioner of Education in the State of
New York, is a human, extremely
amiable man, yet one of dynamic
action. At a banquet held in his
honor at Saylcs Hall Tuesday, the
impression which he gave to over
ISO educators of the state was one
of a man who knew his field
thoroughly and would not hesitate
to act as he saw fit in any matter.

Considerany impressed by Saylcs
and Picrcc l'lalls, lhc Commissioncr
said that thcsc
dormitories per—
formed a true
and one of the
most valuable ed-
ucational f u n c-
tions of a college
institution, "They
should be extend-
ed to all lcacltcr
institutions in the
state", he said.
Hc was particu—
larly pleased with
the spirit of thc
men of lhc dorm.
The social aspcct
of the place was
one of great im—
portance to his
way of thinking.
His connncttl was,
"'1‘ h c dormitory
provides much
morc than artis—
tic accommoda—
lions."

As a tncmbcr
of the Committee
of [he Association
of American Uni~
vcrsilics several
years ago, Dr.
Stoddard at that
limc along with
his associates,
formed a very
favorablc opinion Dr (icot'gc
of Sittlc Collcgc.
its students, and organiralion.

Wlun asked about the fcnsibility
of a Student Union in thc l‘ittt't'cll
Mansion. bc luul lbc grcutcsl t‘cspcci

By J. Michael llippick

Speaking about education in rela—
tion to present war conditions, Dr.
Stoddard said, “The present five-
ycar plan should deﬁnitely remain.
However, we are at present working
toward an accelerated program,
which would reduce the time to
four years. This could be accotn—
plishcd only through the use of
summer sessions. It would be a
temporary measure and Would no
be compulsory, since only about
ottc-fotlt'llt of the students \vould
take advantage of
it," He also was
in favor of pro-
viding temporary

Icacbing licenses

present teaching

C o m m issioncr
Stoddard oil'crcd
pleasing outlook
on the cfl'ccl of
the war upon ed-
ucation and op—
portunities for
teachers in the
post—war world.
“The outlook for
members of the
teaching profes-
sion after the war
is excellent. There
will be 11 Ire-
mendous dcmand
on the part of
soldicrs and civ-
ilians for school—
ing and learning.
Teaching will al-
ways remain one

added.
