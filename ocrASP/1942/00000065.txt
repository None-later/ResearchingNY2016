War Fronts by Feigenbaum

Japanese March Into Manchuria
Marks True Beginning of War

On Monday the newspapers and
magazines of the United States will
carry editorials and feature articles
entitled, “Pearl Harbor Day". “Pearl
Harbor—A Year After,” ctc. Why not
write some articles called, “Warsaw
Day", or “Manchuria—Elcvcn Years
After"?

The Japanese attack upon Pearl
Harbor was the next logical, inevit—
able siep in a war which was started
in 1931—a war in which the United
States was willing to have other
countries ﬁght her battles for her.
This war in which the United States
has participated only one year began
in 193] when Japan seized the pro—
vince of Manchuria from China.
This was the start of the march of
the fascist philosophy whose ulti-
mate aim was world domination.
America sat back and foolishly
watched country after country sac—
rifice itself in a futile attempt to
stop this devastating onslaught.

Remember, Pearl Harbor is a drop
in the bucket camparcd to the
present battle in Russia or China's
six-year fight with Japan. A great
many events happened before Pearl
Harbor. and a great many will
happen after. Why will the news-
papers of our country use the occas—
sion of the first anniversary of Pearl
Harbor to recount the decds of our
fighting forces. while ignoring the
sacrifices of the other freedom—
loving pcoplcs before Pearl Harbor?

The United States of America is
potentially the most powerful conn—
l.l'_l/ in the world. but it is NOT the
only country in the world.

Japan became the first aggressor
by seizing Manehuriu from China on

September 18, 1931. The democra—
cies remained neutral.

Italy‘s conquest of Ethiopia four
years later dealt the League of
Nations its death blow. The dc-
mocracics remaind neutral.

July 7, l.937—Clash of troops near
Peiping, China, brings on present
war between Japan and China. The
democracies remained neutral.

In 1938 Germany occupied Aus-
tria, and Germany, Italy, England,
and France sign an agreement at
Munich giving Hitler his “last. ter-
ritorial demand" in Europe. The
United States remained neutral.

Germany invaded Poland on Sep—
tember l, 1939 after demands for
territory had been refused by Poles.
backed by Britain and France. The
United States rcmaincd neutral.

Bciwccn April I) and May 29,
1940, Germany occupied Denmark
and Norway, launched a great
“blitzkrieg” attack against The
Netherlands. Belgium, and France.
and forced the British Expedition-
ary Force to withdraw from Europe
on the beaches of Dunkirk. The
United States remained neutral.

With the fall of France and the
bombing of Britain, the United
States could no longer remain dis-
interested. On March 11, 1941
President Roosevelt signed the
lease-lend law providing for unlim—
itcd U. S. supplies to England and
other nations fighting Germany and
Italy.

December 7, Milli—Japan opened
the war in the Pacific by attacking
Pearl Harbor. The United States
could no longer remain neutral.

 

Critical Comments

 

The Tuesday evening before
’I‘hanksgiving vacation, Advanced
Dramatics class played host to an
encouragineg large audience. Dc-
spiic the horrible weather, State
students onally trooped into Page
Hall to be entertained by Trccc
Ancy, Bcrt Kiley. and Buck Hip-
pick in "The Ace Is ’l‘rumpcd",
directed by Marjorie Bi'cunig.

The play. having a flexible struc—
tui'c, left the success or failure of
the performance entirely up to the
actors. This was unfortunate since
Miss Ancy alone kept and held
a definite character As usual the
"invincible 'l‘recc" threw hcrscll'
wholeheartedly into her part. and
even throughout her long, emotion—
of speeches she kept her staccato
“East Side" accent clear and
rhythmic.

Mr. Kilcv's pcI'l'orIiunice was good

that Bert himself was acting. Mr.
Hippick tried. He did succeed
in rising to character during emo-
tional peaks, but the intervening
slumps were said indeed.

The set was commendable. The
illusion of spaciousncss on Page
Hall stage is a feat in itself. bth
there it was, complete with bril—
Iiantly stripped walls and gaudy
trappings. A typical gangsicr's
lair.

Preceding the play Ida Roscn
played the piano and Hal Ashworth
and Harold Goldsicin indulged in ii
clever bit of pantomime. Ashworth
as the straight man ust the precise,
clipped movements of panioininc
with understanding. Goldstcin fol—
lowed Asliwoi‘tli's lead with his
own casual charm,

()n the whole, it was it good
evening's entertainment. and in
spots hard work and honest t‘fl'lil'l
slioiic through clearly.

 

 

 

 

____———by Herb Leneker

ONE REASON THE LIBRARY is not open nights is
that necessary help is unavailable . . . Also, not enough
students made use of their opportunities when it was
open, its chief function being a high class date bureau
. . . One 01' the “frustrated females of the P. 0.," dis-
cussing stooge—heaven, vitriolizecl thus: “When the
lights go on again, all over the world, I hope they shed
some of their brilliance in the- li‘brary—our intellectual
dimout. . . ."

THERE ARE TWO SIDES TO EVERY QUESTION:

1. The recommendation of the Annex committee to
have all sandwiches 10c & milk 5c may have to wait
until alterations, insuring more patronage, are com-
pleted—which will be undertaken as soon as pos-
sible. . . .

2. Miss Thompson is very agreeable about the whole
thing, especially the alterations, but as yet no high
authority has spoken to her concerning pt'iCc changes

. and she will have to wait. until they do so. . . .

Don't give up hope—Rumor has it that the quality
cf the sandwiches has lately taken a mysterious turn
for the better . . . The-re are two sides to every ques-
tion. . . .

And why are they coming this

They're only human. They want to

Varsity Debaters Will Attempt
To Put Skids Under Skidmoriles

 

little intelligent discussion never
hurt anyone. . . .

Upholding the Purple and the
Gold in this momentous meet will
be Louis Rabincau, Gordon Baskin,
and Verna Snyder. They will at-
tack thc subject from three angles:
economically, politically, and dip-
lomatically. Maric Soulc. president
of Debate Council, will act as chair-
man for the discussion.

Now for a few words about our
illustrious representatives: the ora—
torical cloqucnce of Rabineau was
recently witnessed in the rivalry dc—
batc; Vcrna Snyder is a veteran in
thc debating field of State. As for
Baskin, he coinplcicly demolished
Colgate and Hamilton in one blow
on the Freshmen team last year.

This is an idea what's in store next
week. They promise to act most re-
spectfully and to refrain from vio—
lcncc. Now come and sec.

World Telegram, the presidents
of 200 institutions of higher
learning. co-operating with the
United States Military Service,
have been notified that the fed-
eral government will either take

tional facilities Only those stu-
dents cngagcd in courses vital to
the military effort (engineering,
pro-medical, and pi'c-dental)
will be reassigned to the various
co-opei'ating campuses.

According to this plan. 250,000
men will be distributed through-
out thc 200 colleges.

mation this does not include

Women Criticize Silent Period
As Being Annoying, Embarossing

 

It’s here again. Silent period with
all its taboos and injunctions is back
once more. Silent period, when
freshmen are forbidden fruit for
sorority girls. That silent period is
a bitter pill for upperclassmcn is
evident enough but to garner frosh
opinion we conducted our own un-
official census among some of the
female members of '46.

Carolyn Brumm who was our first
guinea pig, decided that “it is all
slightly confusing and I will be glad
when it is over." Alicc McGowan
thinks it's OK. for a couple of days,
but two weeks is too long. Mildred
Wolf comes out with the positive
verdict that "it is stupid and doesn't
make for friendliness."

Most of the girls conceded that it
was necessary, but a nuisance, as
Lillian Haighi who termed it “incon—
vcnicnt" whilc her room mate Jean
Whitney chimed in to say that
"wc'vc got to make the best of a
bad situation."

Crashing into a frosh “bull ses-
sion we heard 2i variety of opinions.

by Dorothy Meyers

 

Marie Liebl ihiiiks it’s a good idea,
but stupid to continue it over vaca-
tions. Rennie Brittain calls it “em-
barassing" at times and Pauline
Clevcn, Peggy Casey, and Joyce
MacDonald all joined in to say it
was "0. K., but had too many re-
strictions." Everyone agreed it gave
a chance for unbiased opinion.

Joan William, Gerry Van Allen
and Betty Hamilton agreed that “it
makes one feel snooty." Dotty
Myles gave the consensus of opinion
when she said “it’s a pain in the
neck."

Just to make our census complete
we extended it to include some up-
pcrclassmen. Confronted with the
question Agnes Fitzpatrick volun-
tccrcd, “It gives the rushees a
chance to see the girls impartially."
Dolores Ropke thinks it's a good
idea. prevents dirty rushing and
gives the frosh time to decide on
their choices On the con side,
Anita Leone says, “it is useless, in-
convenient and doesn’t help mat-
tci's." Jane Rooth added emphatic-
ally. "I think it's foul!"
