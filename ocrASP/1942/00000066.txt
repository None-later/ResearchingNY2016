Tough Weekend for Eagles

Coach Elliott Hatﬁeld will lead
his basketball charges into the
season’s opener tonight at Potsdam.
The varsity squad will face a tough
assignment this weekend as it
journeys to Northern New York to
tackle two formidable opponents,
Clarkson Tech and St. Lawrence on
succesive days.

The boys are in top shape physi-
cally and expect to put up good
battles with the more experienced
and highly talented northerners.
State will enter both contests as
the underdog; however, this is no
indication that the Purple and Gold
aggregation will come out at the
short end of the score.

Whatever the Eagles lack in play-
ing ability is compensated by 'l‘tlglt
competitive spirit and fight indi-
cated in practice sessions and in
scrimmages with Siena. The vars-
ity members have been playing to—
gether as a team more than. any
other year. This team play is an

indication that this winter State
students will witness some hard

fought contests on the Page court.
’l‘eam May Win

It is because of this spirited
attitude of the team that we think
the basketball squad will win more
contests this year than State stu-
dents have seen won in past cam-
paigns.

The Eagles will take the floor
tonight with its official captain
for this season many miles away.
Captain—elect Corporal Thomas
Feeney, who was drafted during the
summer vacation, is now stationed
at Fort Monmouth, N. J. It was a
very sportsmanlike act on the part
of the varsity members and MAA,
and at the same time an honor
for Corporal Feeney, to let him re-
main as the captain for the 1942-43
basketball campaign. The squad will
now have a game captain for each
contest. He will be appointed by
the coach previous to the game.
Here and There

We see that in the only cut of the
basketball squad made this year one
of last year’s better yearlings was
eliminated. Not that we want to
cast any aspersions. but it seems to
us that there were others on the
squad more worthy of cut, namely a
junior or a senior.

Now that iliere are only two nights
per week devoted to intramural
contests, we are looking for an early
opening of the bowling lcaguc.

Basketball inaugurates

Although the WAA winter sports
season has now started there are no
new developments since the last
council meeting. The captains have
not yet decided on the hours needed
for credits in the various sports.

STATE COLLEGE NEWS, FRIDAY, DECEMBER 4, 1942

I Varsity Cage Squad Travels

Eagles Meet Larries
At Canton Tomorrow
Afternoon In Followup

The State College Eagles will open
the 1942-43 basketball season tonight
at Potsdam where they will oppose
Clarkson Tech. Last year Tech had
one of the best teams ever to repre-
sent their school, a team which won
a great majority of its games. The
Techmen defeated State twice last
year. Although advance notice has
been lacking, it is reported that this
year’s team will be a strong one.

After tonight's game with Clark—
son, State’s courtmen will entrain to
Canton where they will meet St.
Lawrence in an afternoon tilt. The
Lari'ies, who defeated State last
year in Canton, were later the re—
cipients of a stunning 49-46 upset
as "Bye" Benton pulled a Frank
iVlerriwell for State. Reports have
it that they too have a comparatively
strong team this year.

Scrimmage with Sicna

Coach Hatfield took his charges to
Siena again for a preparatory scrim—
mage on Wednesday. Although the
resulting scores of these Siena
scrimmages were not too encourag-
ing, their value in providing prac-
tice on a large court against first
class opposition may prove valuable.
Scrimmages on thc Sicnu court have
shown that our reserves are no—
ticably weak, and that the spirit and
stamina of the starting live will be
a major factor in the coming season.

In both practice scrimmages the
Statesmen were able to hold their
own until the starters, tired by the
three varsitics of Sicua, were forced
to give way to the reserves. The
reserves, however, should improve
considerably throughout the year
since it is not talent but experience
that they lack.

Ten Make Trip

As the squad stands at present,
Coach Hatfield, Manager Gcnc Mc—
Laren and the following ten will

make the Northern trip. Bora,
Combs, Flax, Hansen, Kullman,

Lynch, Mullin, Marsland, Rubach,
and Young. These tcn will compose
the varsity until jayvec talcut merits
var—positions which will be very
possible after a few games to experi—
ence the Eaglcts

In all probability, the starting
line-up will include Combs and
Hansen at forwards, Young at cen-
ter, and Born and Marsland at the
guard positions. However, due to
the size of the courts and reserves
of their opponents, State‘s reserves
will probably see plenty of action on
this trip.

 To Clarkson for Opener

 

KDR, Ramblers
Win l-M Contest

Competition Runs High
As Campaign Opens

The intramural basketball cam-
paign got under way in Page Hall
gym on time last Tuesday with KDR
and the Ramblers gaining victories
in games featuring hard play and
somewhat loose ball-handling.

In the first game of the season
KDR and KB battled it out in a
hard fought game with the lead
changing hands several times. With
but a few points separating both
teams at all times, the Lake Street
team managed to go ahead in the
final minutes of play and to win by
a 15—14 count. With privett feeding
the ball down the alley and Leonard
and Bombard dropping them in from
underneath, the KDR aggregation
played fast ball and finally out-
niatched Flax, Rabincau and their
fellow cagers.

The Dorm and Rambler teams met
in the second game with the latter
coming out on the long end of a
15-6 score. Both tennis played a
last game with the ball often being
handled loosely in the excitement.
After the Dorm had made good a
foul shot and a field goal in the
early minutes, the Ramblers came
back with five points and maintained
this lead till the half. Still out in
front 6—3 at the end of the third
quarter, the winning quintet put on
a final burst in the final stanza to
cinch the victory. Mcinrcn, and
Kirchcr were thc big guns of the
winners, while Sullivan, Merritt and
Gillcn added much to the loscr's
cause.

With scven teams entered in the
schedule, the current season promises

to yield many surprising games.
Each group is exhibiting a keen

spirit of competition and all feel
confident that they’ll be strong con-
tenders.

Games have been regularly sched-
uled for Tuesday and Thursday
nights and will be played as planned.
except when other events bar this
possibility.

Blisters Reward Big Feats;

Honorary Society Formed

After the ball (game) was
over, the intramural basketball
players limped a handi'apped
'ace to the showers.

Few participants could boast
the absence of blisters from
their first strenuous workout on
the gym floor, but who wanted
to boast of their absence any—
way? There seemed to be more
glory in boasting their presence,
for several were seen exhibiting
their largest and placing small
wagers on them.

Both victors and vanquished
alike have suffered from their
exploits, for as it has been ex-

pressed by some, “Even vic—
tories have turned to de—
(feets)." ’

It is alleged that a new so-

ciety is being formed about
school in honor of those who
have received such injuries and
in order to include girls as well
as boys who play basketball, if
is to be called the Blisters of
I-M Basketball.

 

Gym To Be Open Tomorrow

The Page Hall gym will be open
tomorrow at 3 P .\l. for anyone who
wishes to practice basketball. This
procedure will be followed through—
out the basketball srnsou, provided
that it is not bcing used for other
ptll'poscs. llowcvir. before the gym
can be opened on Saturdays sonic—
onc must sign for it in the Dunn of
Women's oflicc.

Eogfels to Play
At ABC Tonight

The State College Eaglets, the
junior varsity basketball team,
opens its season tonight simultane-
ously with that of the Varsity. The
team opposes the Albany Business
College at 8:00 P. M., tonight on the
YMCA court. No game is sched-
uled for tomorrow night.

The jayvees, although hampered
somewhat by having to watch while
the varsity practiced, has never—
theless worked diligently under the
watchful eye of assistant Coach
Owen Bombard, '43. It has shown
many times in scrimmages against
the varsity that it has the stuff to
make a winning quintet.

Assistant Coach Bombard is very
confident that the Eaglets are open-
ing a successful season. According
to him. “the experience of the upper-
classmen. such as Braun, Capel.
Reed, and Wise will blend with the
spirit of the Frosh, such as Bori-
iiick, Powell, Rucardo, Ryan, and
Woods. to form a winning coin-
bination. I am sure that we will
have a much better all around squad
than the freshmen have had in the
past few years."

The last time a State College team
heat the ABC was in 1939, the
class of 513, doing the trick. From
present appearances, however, our
Eaglcts sccni able to bring home a
victory Friday night.

attractive, but will enable students
to earn extra credit for themselves
Work will be on posters which havc
usually been done as an cxlra-
class activity. The instructor will
will be Miss l'lutchins.

Two courses in drafting. Mechan-
ical Drawing, a basic engineering
study, and 'l‘opographic Drafting.
a course in map making will interest

Miss flutchins says of these
new courses. "I Would like to stress
the \'.llll(' of thcsc new opportuni-

war effort since the beginning of the
current ycar'.’

Students were called upon to
register soon after school convened.
Sixty per cent registered for war
work These registrations were
filed and students notified of classes
and war work. Four first aid classes
and one home nursing class are
underway. Forty—six students are
helping in the Albany Hospital.
Twenty four people are working
rcgularly at the desk in the Dean
of Women's olliccs, sorting and
filing War Council ciirrespondcnce.

Au undetermined number of stu—
dents are acting as translators for
the State War Council. Their work
is with the Polish, French. Jewish,
German and ltaliaii. Those who
signed up for air raid precautions
work have had interviews with the
County War Council and may expect
culls soon. A stamp booth in lower
half of Driqrcr is maimed by stu—

Out of 96 freshmen who were en-
tertained at formal dinners and buf—
fet suppers, 92 have pledged sorori-
ties, This is fourteen more than
were pledged last year, the first year
the 15 quota was put into effect. It
was the privilege of the sororities to
specify on their lists the number,
under 15, of pledges that they
\vishcd. This would allow room for
future members from the class of

There were many and varied
themes for last week-end’s enter—
tainment. KD took its supper guests
to "Old China," then came back to
the present Christmas season for its
formal dinner. Psi Gam entertained

Candlelight Inn." Buffet guests of
Chi Sig also heard a “radio pro-
grai‘n,‘ and a "hotel" was the scene
of formal dinner AE Phi had no

buffet supper, but dinner decor—
ations were done in green and
white. Gamma Kap called Friday's

program "Bullyis Tavern ‘-— Cltez

gave a "television broad 'ast." BZ
held first a "Stage-Door Canteen,"
thcn ate dinner the next night in
"Club B-Zombic." Phi Delt was
