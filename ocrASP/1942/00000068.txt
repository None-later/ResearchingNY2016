Sports
Chatter

By
Pete Marchetta '

On Wednesday night the varsity
basketball squad will inaugurate its
home season against a strong Clark-
son quintet. This will be the ﬁrst
and only appearance that the Eagles
will make on the home court before
the Christmas furlough. .

Because of intervening Circum-
stances it will be impossible to have
a pep rally in Assembly today. How-
ever the team is deserving of all the
support that the students can give
them, and a pep rally will show the
boys that the students are really
behind them.

Pep Rally in Commons

Therefore, the cheerleaders have
decided to have a pep rally Wed—
nesday noon in the Commons.
Mimeographed sheets with the var-
ious cheers on them will be dis-
tributed. These will include the
State College Fight Song. Everyone
should make an attempt to be
present to arouse the basketball
players to a fighting mood, which
they will need against Clarkson that
evening.

Although the squad returned
victory-less from last week's north-
ern trip, they nevertheless played
as well as could be expected. We
must realize that both Clarkson and
St. Lawrence have teams of much
better playing ability.

Muscles Stiff

Then, too, we must not forget
that the players rode all day on
the train and then were playing even
before they realized that they were
in Potsdam. Their muscles were too

stiff to offer their best for the
game. In the contest with the
Larrics, the Statesmcn played better
ball than the score indicates. Only
a half dozen points separated the
opponents throughout most of the
game.

During the past week all squad
members have shown considerable
improvement in ballhandiing and
cutting, and they hope to redeem
themselves in front of local fans.

The fast break, which was to
have been one of State's main
offensives, was used ell'ectively
against them in their trip north.

Moose Gerber was informed by
his physician that he will be physi-
cally lit to play basketball .vithin
a few weeks.

Lemkc, who starred against State
last year in the RPI game, will
captain the Engineer otitfit tomor-
row night.

Casers Oppose R.P.l. Tomorrow Ramble“ Lead

Eagles Meet Tech Takes Team

in Home Contest
St. Lawrence, Clarkson

Trip Quintet in North

The Purple and Gold Eagles will
be seeking their ﬁrst win tomorrow
night when they tackle the RPI En-
gineers in Troy. Returning from an
unsuccessful trip, the team has been
practicing new plays and correcting
their mistakes in order to obtain
better results in Troy.

Besides boasting a strong quintet,
the Engineers offer their annual ob-
stacle, the size of their court, often
termed “the miniature prairie.”
Workouts at Siena and last week-
end's contests should have condi-
tioned the players for this game.
This will be the opening contest for
RPI and it will give them their first
chance to test last year's brilliant
freshman team in varsity competi—
tion.

Meet Clarkson Here

Next Wednesday evening the Page
Hall gym will be the scene of State's
first home contest, when Clarkson
makes its annual appearance. Though
the Techmen proved vastly superior
at Potsdam, the Page Hall court and
recent drills may change the aspects
of the game.

Arriving at Potsdam an hour and
a half late, the players put tip a
hard-spirited fight, which was
nevertheless, unequal to that of the
Tech team. A wide breach in the
score held throughout the game, as
the home team swamped State by a
53—29 score. Smith and Navarro of
the locals SCOlt sixteen and ten
points i'cspcctiVe._. to take scoring
honors for the evening, and nearly
duplicate the total score of ten State
players who saw action. Combs,
Marsland and Bora divided cightccn
points equally to make tip the major
portion of the offense.

Lose ’l‘o St. Lawrence

After a short night at Potsdam,
the team entrained to Canton where
they met St. Lawrence in an after
noon tilt. The Larries took their
measure AIS—35 by virtue of an early
first quarter l7--’l lead. Though the
Statcincn, led by Hansen who netted
twoive points and Marsland who
garnered 7 closed this lead to 22-17
at halftime. they were unable to
emerge victorious.

It was a big Irishman named
O'Connor who dropped, tapped, and
tossed in eight baskets and a foul
shot for a total of seventeen points.
Of course, Varsokc's thirteen points
didn't hinder the Larries' cause, but
it was the former who spelled defeat.

All of State's reserves were pressed
into service and several of them,

especially Iiubach, showed flashes of
ability and spirit.

JV's Drop Game
in Extra Period

In a wild but closely contested
game last Friday night, the junior
varsity tied the Albany Business
College at 72 all, only to lose 76-75
in an overtime period.

Both teams played wide open ball.
with emphasis on the ofl'ensc and
very little defense. as the score iii—
dicatcs.

Bortnick was high man for the
Eaglets, scoring one-third of the
total points garnered. This was
tempered somewhat, however, by
rather poor defensive playing. Ric-
cardo helped by throwing in fifteen
points, and Cape], playing especially
well under the basket, added twelve.
Stt'ectcr with thirty-two and Ed-
wards with twcnty-five were high
for the Businessmen.

Although the game was lost, there
was value in it for the jayvces in
that it brought to light weaknesses
which must be worked on and cor
rcctcd. The team showed both that
it has the basketball skill and com-
petitive spirit necessary for a win-
ning team.

Max Braun and Ed Reed, both of
whom would probably have been a
great help to the Purple and Gold,
were not able to play, Bratni was
ill while [iced suffered from a leg
injury.

An addition to the Eagiet roster
is lied Evans. who started practicc
last week

The next game f'or lilt' junior var—
sity is tomorrow night in Troy 'l‘hcy

fairer 6490: SW

 

The ﬁrst personality to be coit-
sidered in this column, which is to
be a regular feature, is the man who
was acting captain of the team for
the first game of the season, Frank
Hansen.

Frank is a seasoned varsity play-
er, having played on the varsity for
three years, as well as on the Fresh
team, and at the Troy Orphan Asy-
lttin before coming to State. Ath-
letics has been his big extracurri-
cular activity at State; he is a
member of MAA, and plays in all
the intro—mural leagues, except of
course. basketball.

As to his private life, we are
sorry to have to report that there
is absolutely nothing for a scandal-
monger to sink his or her teeth
into. In fact, Frank is almost the
epitome of perfection. He doesn't
smoke to excess, drink to excess, nor
does he have any steady girl—friend
apparently (And what can a
scandal—monger peddle unless it is
something about wine, woman, or
song?)

Like the majority of men in State
he has joined a reserve, specifically,
the Marine Corps Reserve.

At present, he is working at the
Albany Home for Children, in order
to ptit himself through college.

intramural Loop

With 2 Victories

Last Thursday’s action in the
intramural league brought the ﬁrst
of the year‘s upsets as the Ramblers
defeated the once victorious KDR
five, 22-17, in the second game.
In the first contest a strong SLS
quintet downed the Finks, 28-14.

Playing spirited ball against KDR,
the Ramblers dropped in the first
counter, and went on to take an
11-9 lead at the half. During the
second half, they increased the lead
and rolled in to the victory, much
aided by Dingman, who sank sev—
eral spectacular one—handers. Beach
and Pfafl' stood otit for the losers
with 7 and four points respectively.

In the opening game of the eve—
ning the Finks fell as helpless vic—
tims to SLS, who put forth the
strongest team to be seen yet in the
league. With Hippick dropping in
10 points alone and Guarino con—
stantly breaking tip the Fink's of
fcnsivc. Art Olivet and his charges
did not stand a chance from the
opening whistle on. It was a case
of a strong offensive and defensive
squad playing against a team which
had neither.

No games were played Tuesday
night due to the Advanced Dram-
atics productions

Greetings To All Students

(Emma’s Nora: To the students
of State College, Dr. John M.
Sayies, President, extends his
wishes for a happy holiday. This
year's message provides an idea
for post-war construction, ideals
of a “White Christmas.” His
full message follows):

Everywhere this year they
are singing “I want a white
Christmas.” And what do they
mean—certainly peace in this
time of distress, kindness in
these hours of trouble, good will
for this erring world. And so
with this pause in our duties,
time comes to provide oppor-
ttinity to think of our part in
contribution to a new world
which we shall help construct;
peace on earth and good will
to all.

A Merry Season to each of
you.

John M. Sayles,
President.

Stokes Appointed to Post

Sisk Will Leave Soon
For induction in Army

News of the resignation of Miss
Sara T. Delaney, Dean of Women,
which came so suddenly last week,
was conﬁrmed Monday, and Dr.
John M. Sayles, President of the
College, announced the appoint-
ment of Dr. Ellen C. Stokes, In-
structor in Mathematics, to that
position. Another important faculty
change is the release of Dr. Henry
L. Sisk, Instructor in Education,
who will enter the army.

Duties Begin January I

Miss Stokes, who received word
of her tentative appointment from
Dr. Sayles several weeks ago, will
assume her duties  Dean‘ of
Women on January 1, when Miss
DeLaney's resignation becomes
effective.

The new Dean received her
Bachelor and Master Degrees at

versity of Chicago. She has been
a member of the State College fac-
ulty for 16 years. She is a member
of Phi Beta Kappa Society, Sigma
Xi. Mathematics Society, and a fac-
tilty member of Beta Zeta sorority.

Commenting on her position,
which will be permanent, she said,
“1 am looking forward with great
pleasure to working with the stu-
dents. I hope they will give me
as much confidence and help as has
been given other deans. Having
had a close association with many
