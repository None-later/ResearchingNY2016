Reserve Fund ‘ I

If MAA does nothing else this
year, it will have more than served
its purpose for the year. we say
this because we believe that in the
creation of a $1000 reserve to ‘pro-
tect the students who part1ctpate
in athletics. The council has
started something which may prove
of great value as the years go by.
"This fund” stated Bombard, MAA
president, “will not interfere With
any fund now existant in the_col—
lege. It is merely an additional
fund under MAA control."

The need for such a control fund
was brought to light this fall when
Terry Smyth and “Moose” Gerber
were hurt while playing intramural
football This emergency was met
by taking money from the Student
Association surplus.

Realizing the necessity for some
sort of precaution, MAA investiga-
ted possibilities of insurances. How-
ever, it came to the conclusion that
although an insurance company off-
ered better security, the premiums
were in News of MAA’s means.
Therefore. this scheme was advo—
cated whereby the left-over from
each year's MAA and WAA con-
tingency funds will be deposited in
the reserve fund rather than re—
turned to the Student Association
surplus.

The existence of this fund will
improve previous conditions which
made no allowance whatsoever for
a source of income with which to
pay for any serious accident which
might occur during participation in
athletics.

Ramblers, Potter

Still Undefeated

The intramural league standings
are beginning to take a deﬁnite
shape as a result of the games
played during the past week. The
Ramblers and Potter are now tied
for ﬁrst with two and one victories
respectively against no defeats.

Potter Club's 35-22 victory over
SLS in the opener last Thursday
showed that they definitely have the
material to make them contenders
for final honors, Led by Gipp and
Singer with 11 and 10 points re—

spectively, the State street lads
led all the way after matching
SLS's opening field goal. I‘Iippick

was high for the losers with 13.

[n the second game KB displayed
a much better combination than it
did against KDR and swamped the
inexperienced Dorm team 48-18.
Both their ball—handling and floor
game were much improved and Bitt—
inan and Leo Flax struck high
form with 33 points between them.

STATE COLLEGE NEWS, rH'uiisoAY. DECEMBER 17, 1942

State Quintet Down RPI;

Young Sinks Clincher
In State's Initial Win;
Players Earn Pants

The unpredictable Eagles chose
RPI as their ﬁrst victim of the year,
and upset them 33—32 at Troy last
Saturday. A last half rally beyond
expectation was necessary to ac—
complish this feat as RPI succumbed
to State for the first time in their
new '87 gym.

The ﬁnal score, even though it
was c105e was no indication of the
excitement and thrills of the game,
from the State viewpoint, of course.
The 33-32 score certainly doesn’t
suggest an eight-point State deficit
at the half and a 23—11 score a few
minutes later, before the spirit and
conditioning of the Eagles closed
this lead.

New Pants!!!

Clad in the royal purple “warm-
up" pants, for which they had been
clamoring so long (the last State
team to wear them was the team of
'4], the squad entered the “parade
grounds," and after a disappointing
start earned the right to wear them.
Hatﬁeld's promise to let them keep
them if they won may or may not
have had its psychological effect,
but nevertheless, these purple togs
did add to the appearance of the
squad.

The defeat was bitter medicine
to RPI, for it was their second con—
secutive loss at the hands of Hat-
ﬁeld's charges. This defeat also
resulted in expressions of “sour
grapes" to last year's RPI alibi re-
garding State's "bandbox" gym, as
the Statesmen turned the trick on
their opponents own eccentric court.

No Individual Stars

Individual stars were lacking in
State's lineup, but the main threat
in the RPI squad was their tall
center Hccht, who scored ten points
and played excellent defensive ball
to keep the Engineers in the game.
Hansen's seven points were enough
to garner scoring honors for State,
leaving twenty-six points which
were distributed rather evenly
among the other ﬁve scorers.

The Eagles finally gained the
lead in the closing minutes of play
 Comb's basket from mid—court
was duplicated by Young's clever
lay-up shot. This gave the Purple
and Gold a 33-30 lead which was
protected well enough despite one
final Engineer goal. as the players
"froze" the ball.

Credit must be given to Coach
Hatfield who anticipated the need
for conditioning and scheduled
practices at Sicna The effect of
these drills was obvious at the end
of the game as State's starters fin—
ished strong.

 Overcome Lead to Win

 

STATESMEN DROP PAIR
TO CLARKSON, Y.M.C.A.

When the nets had ﬁnally cooled
off last night, the score showed the
Statesmen behind Clarkson 63-39.

State enjoyed their only lead of
the evening when 8010 Marsland
tapped in a pair of rebounds, The
visitors then put into action their
spot pass offense and were never
threatened leading at the half 25-12.

Big gun for the visitors was
Mavarro who dropped the 28 points
which proved the margin of victory.
Despite the sparkling play or Han—
sen, Bora and Mullin, the Statesmen
were unable to master enough
strength to dampen the ﬁre.

In the preliminary game, the
jayvees. lacking any creditable
offense, came out on the short end
of a 54—35 score. Capel paced the
losers with a dozen points.

Every basketball team must have
its floor general, and this year it
is indubitably Harry Bora. With
good reason does he hold this posi-
tion, for he has had many years
experience with a basketball; four
in Scotia High School, and three in
college.

 

As was the case with Hansen,
Harry's extracurricular activities
have been strictly athletic. He
was a member of MAA, and a par—
ticipator in some intramural sports.

He is now a senior and a member
of the Air Corps Reserve. Of course,
this means that he will be called
soon after graduation, and for this
reason we extend him our deepest
sympathy. He will be leaving much
more behind him than other State
College men since he was married
last August. His wife is the former
Mary Colfels. Remember her, '44?

Incidentally, he is known in most
quarters by the somewhat melo-
dramatic nickname of “Handsome
Harry."

Jayvccs Lose Game
To Engineer Yearlian

The State junior varsity lost its
second straight game last Saturday
night, 35-27, to the RPI Frosh. Only
in the ﬁrst half did the jayvees
even stay in the running; still they
were trailing 1'1—1‘4 at the inter—
mission. During the second half
the Engineers took control of the
game and were never further
threatened.

At no point in the game did the
State team display the ability of
which it is capable. It had the
advantage of playing the Techmen
in their ﬁrst game. The opponents,
however, had that one essential
which can make the difference be-
tween a winning team and a team
that hasn’t a chance against com-
petition, teamwork. In the JV team
this quality was sadly lacking.

For the Eaglets, “Big Ed" Reed
was high scorer with a total of eight
points made on spectacular one-
handed shots. Anderson was high
for the victors with 14 points.
