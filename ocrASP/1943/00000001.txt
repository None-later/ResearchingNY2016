WAC State Fair Elementary Dramatics Class

Stokes Likes Student Cooperation,-
Optimistic About Wor Activities

 

“I'm fascinated by them," re—
marked the new Dean of Women
who stopped gazing skyward long
encuin to communicate a welcom-
ing smile; then she invited, “Just
come to the window and watch.”

After a few seconds of respectful
silence during which three Army
planes soared eastward out of sight.
Miss Ellen Stokes oflicially said,
"Hello." Btit her eyes still showed
excitement and a wistful fondness
for adventure. Apologetically she
explained. "Airplanes really do fas-
cinate me Although I've never
ridden in one. I'd love to."

We noticed a pair of wings on
her lapel which. she told us. was
awarded for her work as a member
of the Interceptor Command. the
nearest she had gotten to air travel.
Only recently has Miss Stokes stop—
ped these activities. and she plans
to resume them as soon as she feels
"at home" as the new Dean of
Women

Miss Stokes' has aii avid interest
in the war effort and is optimistic
about the future of the War Ac-
tivities Council. Having never
atttnded a meeting of the Council
previous to her appointment, the
new Dean does not feel competent
to act as advisor to the WAC im-
mediately “However, I feel the
Council should be aided by the

Forum To Hold
Quiz Program

Forum is planning a “lie detector"
program for next semester at which
time true and false statements will
be made concerning the war. By
pronouncing a statement true.
false, or biased, a rough estimate
may be obtained of one‘s knowledge
of current events.

At the meeting Wednesday. Verna
Snyder. '43. suggested that Forum
supervise Americanization classes
for new citizens. Shirley Wurz, '43.
Speaker of Forum. says concerning
this. "If we can see our way clear
to conduct such classes. we would
he cooperating with the community.
which would please us very much.
We should like to concentrate to a
much greater extent on school and
local activities next semester."

At present. It‘orum committees are
doing research on Congress. Dc-
Gaullc. Giraud. and the Republican
Party.

Since this semester is nearly over.
Miss Wurz urges that all people
desiring credit for Forum to please
send her a note next week enumer-
ating their committee work so far.

is now acting as temporary chair-
man." As soon as the semester is

froin her teaching duties; then she
feels she will be “well enough ae—
quainted to begin wholeheartedly.“

During the few days that she
has sat behind the large desk in her
new oflicc. Miss Stokes has found
the friendliness and cooperation of
the students encouraging. “I felt
when I accepted my appointment
that I would have a very fine
student body to Work with." she
said. “Otherwise I would not have
taken over the responsibility," In
reply to a query as to how she
felt as Deati. Miss Stokes replied
sincerely and simply. "I like it very
much."

first desire is. She estimated that
her present acquaintancesliip is

invitations.

Miss Stokes will also reveal her
plans and expectations of the stu—
dent. body in this morning's as-

trated map showing salient features
of Orange County during the revo-
lutionary period. Included also is
the information which formed the
basis for research. The whole dis—
play was organized by the art de-

Jerks ln ERCs Will Get the Works

Slated for Feb. 6
Booths, Stands, Skit

IL Entertain Students

'1"! .t important event of the
second 'mCSlOI‘ will be the State
Fair. sen lulrd for Saturday eve—
ning, February 6. This Fair. spon—
sored by War Council. is to be a
college-wide activity for the pur—
pose of unifying the faculty and
the student body, as well as to raise
money for War activities on the
campus.

Each of the eighteen group—
houses will have charge of a con—
cession. By Wednesday, final plans
will be submitted for approval. thus

enabling concession plans to get
under way immediately.

Tentative plans include a bur-
lesque show. kiss booths. weight

guessing. pitching pennies. and hot
dog and ice cream stands. Dr.
Louis C. Jones. Assistant Professor
of English. is oll'ering thi black
puppies. six weeks old. as a prize
for the most ingenious concession.
Dr. Jones says. "These two black
puppies are males whose names are
Yipper and Yammer. The mother
is a thoroughbred collie; the father.
a traveling salesman "

Booths will be set tip in the
lower corridor of Draper. in the
Lounge. and in the Commons. The

faculty will also have charge of
concessions. Dr. Lester says. “We
urge everyone to spend as little

money as possible. to exercise orig—
inalin at the least possible cost.

It would be wonderful if conces-
sions could be set up without
spending any money at all."

The highlight of the evening

will probably be the skit. written
and enacted by the faculty. which
is to be it take-off on the student

body.
There will be no admission fee
since sutlicient money is expected

from the patronizalion of the var—
ioLis concessions,
