NO Tax On Spirit

This is a plea to State (Zollegc students. It is
a plea because there is a situation here that.
demands tiltciitiIiIi——-iioii' more than ever.

 

In a few weeks. a goodly percentage of the
male students of this tollcge will be leaving
to enter a phase of life far different from any-
tfi iig they have known before. They are leaving
a mode of life to \\'llf(ll we are all accusioincd.
a mode of life \\'l|l(ll they shall miss more and
more. a mode of life which we who shall still be
here for many weeks to Ionic do iioi appreciate.

Nearly cici'y single blatc man in service who
has come back to tollcge has expressed his
pleasure for the days he has spent here and his
regret that they are over. Nearly everyone of
them has also conimcnicd on the value and the
significance of the lliltixgl'UIIllfl and ilic assoiia-
tions that his college life gave him.

Yet we who have the inestiniablc priiilcgc of
(ontiiiiiing otir eduation in our prcsent envi-
ronment fail miserably to grasp the mean ng of
‘I'\ file that is ours. We all go through the
motions of tollege life: we go to classes. we see
our friends. we take part to some degree in
tollegiatc activities. lint we do not go far
enough.

To entirely too many of ii». college is simply
a means in an end That. and nothing more.
loo few of us think of Stale (Iollegc as a plate
that is an integral part of our cxisleinc. How
many of us think of ourselves as a student of
State (lollcgc with a true feeling of pride and

Russians Trap German Troops;

[Carrying the Ball]

Russia is still carrying the ball
for the United Nations. Josef
Stalin. voted ilie man of the year
by Time Magazine. took everything
that Hitler could give during the
fall and early winter. and then or—
dered his own armies to counter-
attack. ‘Somchow. somewhere. the
the Red Army massed a huge re-
scrve army which launched a tre-
mendous counter—attack while the
Germans were still ﬁghting in the
streets of Stalingrad.

The Russians first encircled the
Germans around Stalingrad. and
then enveloped the German army
which sought to break the trap
f'Iom the west. A third drive was
started in the Caucasian Mountains
region and is making slow headway.

Vclikie Luki. northwest of Mos—
e..w. fell to the attacking Russians
who are continuing toward the Lat-
vian border. Should the Soviets
succeed in reaching the Latvian
border. the supply lines of the en—
tire Nazi army in Northern Russia
will be severed.

Lord Strabolgi. writing for the
United Press. estimates that the
bulk of German reserves of 70 divi—
sions have been sent to the Russian
front because the Red Army has
been inflicting heavy losses as well
as capturing strategic positions. He
says the German casualty rate on
the Eastern front during the last

For Allies

nine weeks of 1942 was higher than
in the decisive battle on the West—
ern front in 1918 which preceded
the German collapse.

Wcat‘hcr conditions on the North
African front has brought military
action to a virtual standstill. Deep
mud has prevented all armored
units movement. and the mud will
not dry for another five or six
weeks.

Rommel is still retreating into
Tunisia pursued by General B. L.
Montgomery's British Eighth Army.

The Nazis in Tunisia are strong.
It is estimated that they have
massed at least 100.000 men and
possibly 3.000 planes. They‘ll be
much stronger when and if the
Afrika Korps joins them with be—
tween 35.000 and 40.000 seasoned
desert. fighters. The chances of
thrusting a wedge between the two
Axis forces before they meet seems
remote at the moment.

General MacArthur reports that
thc extermination of the Japs on the
island of New Guinea is proceeding
satisfactorily. Allied airmen are
breaking up every Jap attempt to
enforce their units on the island.
Director Elmer Davis of the Office
of War Information said reports in—
dicated the Japanese were massing
an armada in the Solomons but
that bombers from General Mac-
Ai'thur's command had done “a
very good job on that fleet."

 

Notes and Hoff-Notes

by Mary Studebaker

All five of State College‘s music
lovers ttiriied otit last night to hear
a very worthwhile concert which
was presented. incidentally. under
great handicaps. unbeknownst to
most of lllt' public,

In the Words of Edgar H Van
t)llll(lit. music critic of the "'l‘iiiics—
Union” the girl's chorus was “ex-
ceptionally line" and the orches-
tra "surprisingly food.” llc rc—
gi'etted. as did the News critic.
the lack of interest shown by the
Albany public and State College
students in such a presentation

The one weakness of the evening
might be said to be the violins
and the soprano:1 'I‘liis weakness,
however. was Iiiore it case of lack
of quantity rather than quality.
Also must be considered the tin—
avoidable absencc of male voices
in the chorus (Cost In guerre)

Among the bt-si of the orchestra
selections were the fortunate choice
of the opening number, the "Grand
March” from "Aida". and the "Em-
peror Waltz" which was played
with great sincerity and technical
skill under the capable direction

of Earle Snow. Mr Snow. by the
way. deserves special praise for his
arrangement of fi‘raiiek's "Panis
Angelicus” which held the audience
from beginning to end. and the
presentation of the national anthem.
Unfortunately, the delicate prosa-
iciicss of llaydii was once again
forced upon the audience.

The ehorus' group of Christmas
songs was Very moving. Especially
should be lauded the Laiicashirc
folk stillL’. "Christmas day in the
morning." which was sung with
great spirit 'l‘hcir best group.
li|I\\'t'\'l'i. were the Moussorgsky
numbers. "Prayer from Boris Godu—
now." and the "Chorus of l’i'iest—
csscs from Salammbo" The out-
standing choral feature of the eve—
ning was l‘ilgnr's "The Snow" in
this selection the chorus lititl full
opportunity to demonstrate its pro-
fessional skill in tone control and
emotional interpretation This tone
control was evident. in the beautiful
"Peat—fire sniooring prayer ”

Personal praise goes to Harry
Kensky's playing of the tympaiiy
and Jane Southwick’s 'cello solos.

One of the gayest events of the year for this column
was the reunion of the inmates of second floor front
right; us. the more or less dashing Beyer. and Ensign
EDWIN J. HOLISTEIN, back for a day or so awaiting
future orders. ED recounted the usual interesting
activities (between reminiscences) but offered an
added attraction. describing the time when Kelly. of
PTB and Bataan Nurse fame. spoke to the middies—
giving a blow by blow account of the exploits of his
mosquito boat.

Contributing factorettes to the evening’s gaiety:
Janet Baxter. the little girl who simultaneously
changed her hair and her fortune; and Shirley Ford.
ultra-attractive "wow" girl of ’46. . . .

leader got back safely. despite concentrated Nazi ef-
forts to the contrary. . . .

him slightly, since it will delay his graduation—and

parative luxury of a liberal arts education for the
arduous restrictions of military training. MARION
SOVIK caused a mild bombshell by the announce-

LETTERS TO SOLDIERS

War Activities Council is sponsoring an exteiisch
drive to get everybody writing to at least one State
soldier every week. and we think it is one of the best
ideas coming out of the august body in a long time.

You may be buying bonds. yoti may be working
hard to make the State Fair a success. you may be
dcploring the general attittide of your classmates Icon-
ccriiing the war. you may be flooding the place
pcriodieally with trite oratory. you may be building
the tank l'c runs. you may t'\'til make posters by the
score but just remember that the soldiers are doing
the .dirty work the real Work and your efforts and
sacrifices are puny cotiiparcd to theirs.

Sports
Chatter

By
Pete Marchetta ,

 

With the basketball schedule only
one—third completed. the Eagles will
start the new year under the
tutelage of Coach Harry Grogan.
This is still another change imposed
upon State College by the war.

MAA must be congratulated for
the way it took this hurdle in its
stride. No time was lost. On Mon—
day morning MAA learned that
Coach G. Elliott Hatfield had been
ordered to report to Chapel Hill.
On Monday noon. MAA and the
faculty Athletic Council met and
made its decision.

MAA Cooperales

The willingness with which MAA
and other members of the student
body cooperated with the adminis—
tration in taking over the Gym
classes is indicative of the way
State College students are taking
the war and its consequences. We
are postive that the Gym classes of
1943 will be as spirited and benc-
ficial as they have been thus far.
and that they will meet with the
approval of both the Army and
Navy.

The basketball schedule was ar-
ranged so flexibly that the campaign
may be discontinued at any time.
However. Owen Bombard. president
of MAA. promises that the athletic
governing body will make every
attempt to maintain intercollegiate
competition. Only when no other
solution is possible. will this single
remaining varsity sport be dropped.

Thus the 1942—43 athletic program
has already survived two severe
trials: it fought for its existence in
September and is now smoothly
functioning despite the change in
staff in mid-.sLasoii. The sports
program of the college. like the
male students of the college who
aI in reserves. is living day'by
day. never knowing what tomorrow
holds in store.

Hatfield Says Farewell

lii saying farewell to the basket—
ball playcrs last Monday. Lt. Hat—
field expressed his regrets at leav—
ing State College. Both MAA and
the basketball team presented him
with gifts. in appreciation of his
services. III thanking the men for
the gifts. the former coach replied:
“The bLst. gift you can give me is to
beat RPI next. Friday night."

The principal trail which charac—
terized the I'laificld-coachcd State
teams was the tendency to fight to
ilic finish. In every game. whether
won or lost. the Purple mid Gold
men were in there lighting. and giv-
ing all they had tiiitil the final
whistle blew.

STATE COLLEGE NEWS, FRIDAY, JANUARY 8, 1943

‘ Hatfield Enters Navy; Grogan New Coach;

Varsity Plays Brooklyn Poly Tomorrow

Coach Hatfield
Enlists In Navy;
Grogan to Coach

G. Elliott Hatfield, athletic di—
rector and teacher at State College
for over six years. left last Tuesday
in order to begin active service in
the Navy. Coach Hatfield received
a commission as a Lieutenant (s. g.)
during the Christmas recess.

The sudden departure of Coach
Hatfield. coming so unexpectedly.
left MAA and the Administration
with a great problem. concerning
the whole athletic program. An
emergency meeting of MAA was
held with tch departing coach last
Monday in Dr. Sayles' office in
order to decide what should be
done in regard to the situation.
From this meeting came the an—
nouncement that Harry Grogan.
athletic director of the Millie
school. would take over the job
of coaching State’s inter-collegiate
basketball squad. and have nominal
charge of the physical education
program. The actual carrying otit
of this program is to be done by
student leaders. selected by MAA
for their leadership and sense of
responsibility. The Infra-Mural
program has not been affected.

Coach Hatfield came to State in
1930 from Union College. He has
here been both athletic director
and. for a short time. Instructor in
History. From Ohio State Univer-
sity he obtained his B. S. in Edu-
cation. M. A.. and Ph. D.. the last
obtained only last year Previous
to his coming to State. he coached
and directed the athletic programs
at Lowell (Wyoming) High School.
Elgin Junior College. Dakota Wes-
leyan University. Rochester Uni-
versity. and Union College.

Although youthful in botli age
and coaching experience. Grogan
has already proven at Milne that he
has the qualities necessary for a
successful coach. He has built a
team which promises to hold its
own against the larger schools which
it is playing this year, Coach
Grogan scheduled these larger
schools with the remark that he
didn't want a winning season if it
bad to be against weak competition.

Potter Takes Lead
In luM League

The intramural basketball season
was resumed last Tuesday with
several changes resulting in the
standings.

Potter f‘hib's 34-24 win over the
Ramblers in the first game of the
evening pushed the latter from the
undefeated ranks and left the vice
tors in undisputed possession of
first place Leavingr no doubt as to
their strength. they led all the way
and managed to increase their lti-l-l

Varsity to Meet
Brooklyn Poly

In Page Hall Gym

The varsity quintet reopens its
schedule this Saturady when Brook-
lyn Polytechnical Institue invades
Page Hall. As has been the case
throughout the year. MAA Press
Bureau has failed to obtain in-
formation regarding the opponent.
but other sources disclose the fact
that they have been none too suc-
cessful this year. Last June‘s grad-
uation and the transferrance to
Niagara of Yesavich, a standout
player whom State will face later.
lcfi BPI weak in comparison to
their usual strength.

This condition plus the acqui-
sition of a new coach. new tactics.
and new spirit should give State an
excellent chance to score its second
victory. Those who have seen the
recent practice sessions share the
squad's enthusiasm. for it seems the
days of the “figure eight” are over.
and the fast breaking collegiate
style of ball is to make its debut at
State this week.

Coach Grogan has forwarded on
starting line up as yet. but little will
be ventured in predicting it to be
the same as in State's previous con—
tests

The Siatcsmcn have two other
games before another schedule in—
terruption due to examinations. Next
Wednesday they will be visited by
Middleburg for the first. time in
several years. Middlcburg has
played fair ball up to date. so this
too should be a hard fought game.

Saturday. the 15th RPI, victim
of the Eagles once this year. will
appear here for a return engage—
ment. Though they lost two sen-
iors by graduation, one of whom
was llccht. standout performer in
their earlier defeat. RPI will be
tough ainl vengeful from start to
finish.

Ito-Inning play after exams.
the Eagles will face Union. who
played their opener this week. at
Schenectady This game is sched—
uled for Feb. fl.

MAA and WAA wish to announce
their annual sports carnival which
will take place immediately after

It Could
Be

WUTZ

 

 

Officially the WAA winter sports
season opened the week after
Thanksgiving vacation. This, how-
ever. is only according to the
written record. In performance the
winter season has yet to begin
since very little has been accom-
plished in regard to the three
main features of this season.
These are the bowling league, the
basketball tourney, and the ping-
pong tournament. Let’s see what
has been done concerning each of
these.

Last year the WAA bowling
tourney was the most successful
feature of the sports program. Also
last year the bowling tourney be-
gan the second week of December.
This year it will not get underway
until February. Only the cap-
tains have been chosen.

The basketball tourney is still
in a formative stage. Nothing
definite has been accomplished. Yet
last year games had been played
by December 12.

No Ping-Pong?

Last year we had a very suc-
cessful ping—pong tournament; this
year one has not even been planned.
We wonder why not? We have
an extremely enthusiastic group of
woman ping—pong fans. They
should be given an opportunity to
display their ability.

We know that it's easy to criti-
cise. but we also feel that there‘s
a time and place for criticism and
that this is it. WAA is not de-
livering as active a sports program
as the women of State should
have. Every organization which
is supported by Student Associa-
tion owes a duty to the student
body. WAA receives slightly un-
der a thousand dollars each year.
This is quite a bit of money for
the lukewarn‘i type of sports pro-
gram which has been offered this
year.

Efficiency Missing

There seems to be a general lack
of efficiency in the organization.
Things should be completed on
schedule The tennis tourney
could hth- beeii completed. if play—
ers had been made to forfeit missed
games. WAA needs less red tape
and more red blood.

Past performances prove that
tournaments are the most popular
features of the sports setup at
State. Yet WAA ignores this de-
mand. Rivalry mid the spirit of
competition create interest. Why
doesn't WAA promote a swimming
meet‘.’

Every other year WAA has spon—
sored a fall banquet There was
