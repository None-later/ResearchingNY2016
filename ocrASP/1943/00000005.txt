Junior Prom Will Be Farewell Fling for ERC’S

The class of ’44 will enjoy its last
mad fling before the boys go march-
ing off when it celebrates the tradi-
tional Junior Weekend. The date is
shoved up and the price is shoved
down so that every little lad and
lassie can attend this gala affair for
an evening of fun to remember for
the duration.

Arrangements for the weekend
are under the direction of Fred
Shoemaker, general chairman.
Chairmen of assisting committees
are: Music, Saul Stolbof; Decora—
tions. Hannelore Schoen and Paul
Barcelou; Arrangements, Mary Do-

mann; Publicity, Trece Aney; Pro-
grams and Bids. Patricia Latimer;
Chaperones. Paul Ferencik; Invita—
tions, Carolyn Lively. Committees
have been working overtime since
the date for Prom was moved up.

The weekend will open officially
Friday night with the banquet.
Juniors will dine from 5:30 to 7:30
P. M. in the familiar surroundings
of Herbert‘s, well known to all State
socialites. Janet Baxter will give
the class prophecy and Betty Gra-
velle and Hal Ashworth, the class
history. The main speaker of the
evening will be Dr. C. C. Smith.
Tickets will be sold for $1.25.

Saturday night Beauty and the
Beast will don best. bibs and tuckers
to waltz and fox-trot from 9 P. M.
to 1 A. M. Gas rationing will change
the scene of the festivities from
the Aurania Club where former
proms have been held to the popular
Ingle Room of Pierce Hall. Since
pleasure and comfort are the key-
notes of the evening dancers will
come in semi-formal attire. Bids
will be $1.65 as compared to $3.30
bids sold last year. Prom Queen
will still hold court with four other
“glamour gals”as atttendants. Hur-
ried plans will not diminish the
gaiety and enthusiasm of the crowd.
It’s all-out for Junior weekend.

Chatter

By
Pete Marcheffa

 

The effective use of the Zone de—
fense by State's basketball op—
ponents apparently has shown Coach
Harry Grogan that. a zone can be
an effective defense on the Page
Hall court. After watching Brook-
lyn Poly, Middleburg, and RPI
topple the Purple and Gold. the
Eagles' mentor switched his team’s
defense from a man to man to a
2-1—2 zone.

rI‘hc adjustment that the bnskct-
ball squad had to makc under a
different lutelagc was evident in thc
Brooklyn Poly contcst, lltt'lt‘ first
under Couch (lrognn. 'l‘hc Eagles
appciu'cd hclplcss. They didn't
know what to do with the ball and
rarcly followed up thcir shots.

Statesman Will Meet Pratt

Eagles Bow to Union,
Zone ls Ineffective

As Foe Scores, 60-25

The resumption of normal school
activities brings back to the spot—
light. State's remaining basketball
schedule, and to Page Hall tomor—
row at 7:30 the Cannoniers from
Pratt.

The only possible comparison be—
tween Pratt and State as far as this
year‘s play is concerned is that that
they nost out the same BPl team
that defeatch us 42—34. They have
a more impressive record than State
so far this scason. but some team
must get the benefit of the stored-
up rcvengc which is boiling over in
thc Eagles.

I’ratl Strong

Pratt has a starting aggregation of
sharpshmitcrs, each of whom is 'in—
oblc of winning scoring honors in
any game. Raphael. Knplowitz,
I’lollwcdel. MncPhcc. and Cavatuio
have all averaged eight points or
bcttcr so far this season. They use
the “man to man" and "zone" dc-
fcnscs with equal succcss, and lulvc
the ability to pop, fast break, or
"work it in" as thc occasion dc—
moods.

The game prcviously scheduled
for Friday night was changed in
order flint Sicna might schedulc
them for their open (late tonight.
Pratt's performance tonight against
Sicna will do much in rcvcaling
their strcngth for many of Stafc's
varsity will have the opportunity to
watch them bcforc they play thcni.

Butch Walker, Al Stone, Dutch
Erbstein. Fred Shoemaker, Art
Cornwall, and Stan Gipp, donned
packs and camper-'5 clothes for
their annual camping trip. Re-
laxation after a hectic exam
week?

Their destination was Butch
Walker’s hunting lodge in the
Berkshire Mts., eight miles from
Chatham. The six walked eight
miles in the dark, Butch miracul-
ously finding the camp.

They were welcomed with buck—
shol. amusineg arranged by
Butch and two of his friends who
had opened the lodge for him.

Hardly did their bones get used
to wooden beds, cold floors, and
AI Stone's cooked “meals” when
they had to return to the old
grind. Eight miles walk plus 30
minutes train ride and the six
were back in Albany.

Willi the schedule over half coin-

in pltlycrs, crutches, and systems has
had much to do with State's un-

JV's Hil Stride;
Beat Pharmacy
For Fourth Win

State College's Junior Varsity
basketball team came through with
its fourth win in the last five games
last Tuesday night by taking the
measure of the Albany College of
Pharmacy, 45-36, displayinng the
same balanced style of play which
has lately been carrying them to
Victory.

The Purple and Gold took an

early lead, then lost it, and finally
pulled ahead of a desperately ﬁght-
ing Pharmacy five. Bortnick tallied
19 counters for the Eaglets, while
Sweeney poured 13 through the
hoop for the losers.
_The Jayvces have also played
four other contests since the last
issue of the NEWS. winning three
of these. On Saturday, January 0.
they took the measure of Siena's
Junior varsity, a previously un—
beaten tcum. It was a hard fought
game, the teams being separated by
only a few points all during the
game.

'I‘hc third quarter was the decid-

ing period. for State outscored its
rivals 14-9 to lead by six points.
35-20.
. The final score was 45—4] in
favor of the Purple and Gold. Bort-
nick and Riccardo were high non
for State with It) points apiece, while
l-lippick contributed 10 counts.
Knaugh sank 10 for the losers.

The following Wednesday, Jami-
My 13, the Eaglcts, remembering a
70-75 defeat in their first game of
the scason, gained revenge by dc-
lcatiug ABC 40-22 in a return game
played in Page Hall. In this game
the team's potential offensive ability
cxplodcd in such a manner that the
outcomc of the game was never in
doubt. Bortnick, high man with 23
