STATE COLLEGE NEWS, FRIDAY,

Bulger, SEB Director, Writes
On [Why Remainlin Teaching,

This is the ﬁrst in a series of ar—
ticles written by prominent ﬁgures
at State College on “Why Remain in
Teaching?” This article was written
by Mr. Paul. G. Bulger, Director of
the Student Employment Bureau
and Assistant Principal of the Milne
School. Subsequent articles will be
contributed by Dr. John M. Sayles,
President of the College, Dr. Milton
G. Nelson, Dean, and Dr. Robert W.
Frederick, Principal of the Milne
SchooL

There are one million teachers in
the United States at present. Of
this number. there are about 84,000
in New York State. New York City.
Buffalo. and other large cities cm-
ploy about 45,000. leaving 39,000 in
smaller cities and rural communities
of the state. There is a shortage of
teachers at present. Different esti-
mators have reported this shortage
to be from 50,000 to 75.000 in the
country. New York State has its
proportion of this shortage, although
the shortage in the state is not as
critical as in other states because of
the better salaries that it pays to its
teachers.

At State College we train people
to teach in New York State schools.
Our graduates are placed in some of
the best schools in the state.

Salaries. in this state, for teachers
are on the upgrade. This year many
teachers are beginning at salaries of
$1400 to $1500. The maximum sal—
ary in some school systems for
teachers with a master's degree is
about $2400. I believe that these
increases will continue. In addition
many schools are giving bonuses
and increments this year to meet the
increased cost of living. What other
profession offers $1400 to a begin-
ner‘.’ Lawyers until recently rc-
ceivcd a weekly salary of $0 to $8

when they were starting practicing.
All doctors don’t drive Packards.
However, you must realize that al-
though salaries are being raised at
present, there will soon be a stabil-
ization period.

During the last depression, teach-
ing was the only going business.
Even skilled mechanical laborers
entered the teaching profession and
secured certification.

I also believe that teaching is a
public service. Most of us want to
perform some public service and the
answer to this search can be found
in the teaching profession. In addi-
tion. we have often heard that youth
is the hope of the future. Teaching
affords that. opportunity to deal with
youth.

The social standing of teachers is
good. It’s a clean job~a job where
you are constantly growing intellec—
tually.

In a recent. survey of over 2000
graduates of State College. it was
found by the Student Employment
Bureau that many graduates are in
the service About 98".. of these
servicemen indicated that they
wanted their folders to be carried
on in the SEB files since they
wanted to return to teaching after
the war is over. This point alone
signifies to me that there is some-
thing in teaching that gets hold of
a man and keeps him in the field
with teaching as a life position.

We'll always have schools and
children. The people of the State
of New York alone spend 365 mil-
lion pcr year on education. New
York State offers some fine schools.
comparatively high salaries and
worthwhile security to those who
remain in teaching.

After his graduation from State
College. Dr, Dorrance attended Al—
bany Medical College and ranked

National Board Examinations which
are given annually to Senior inedi—
cal students. He then served a tom
and a half year internship at Mt.
Sinai Hospital in New York City
and won a fellowship in medicine to
Johns Hopkins Hospital.

At State Dr. Dorrance was a
member of Myskania. Edward El-
drcd Potter Club. and voted the

Students Wishing Teaching Jobs
Urged to File Data With SEB

Mr. Paul G. Bulger, Director of
Student Employment Bureau, re-
quests all Seniors who wish jobs for
next year to hand in their folders
and‘ pictures immediately. In order
to facilitate interviews, they should
also hand in schedule cards so that
they can be contacted at any time.

Openings for jobs to be ﬁlled im—
mediately and in September are
coming in rapidly. To date most of
the openings are in the Commerce
ﬁeld. There are 15 jobs open for
Commerce students and only 18
students actually registered in the
Commerce department. Other posi—
tions to be filled are as follows; Sci—
ence, 12; Mathematics, 5; Library. 2;
English. 3; English—Library. 5; Eng-
lish—Social Studies. 2; Social Studies.
7: Social Studies-English, 3; French-
Latin, 2: French—Spanish, 1; Latin-
Spanish. 3.

Mr. Bulger stresses the problem
which the graduating student faces.
On one hand there is a definite need
for teachers in the schools. How—
ever those who apply for a tempo-
rary license must remember that,
they will be at a disadvantage when

the war is over and they are forced
to compete with teachers who have
received their masters degree. Mr.
Bulger feels that it is a personal
problem and he will be glad to talk
to any Senior confronted by these
alternatives.

Student Employment Bureau has
also placed the following people:

Lloyd Clum, Tuxedo Park, Science;'

Elizabeth Chamberlain, Thiells, Li-
brary; Harold Ferguson, Chester.

ville. Social Studies; Betty Gordon,

wood. Walton, Latin; Sam Cooper,

ERC Air Cadets
Receive Orders;

Leave March 1
Math-Science Majors
May Stay for Semester

The future of State’s enlisted men
took on a new turn this week with
the receipt of orders by Enlisted
Air Corps men and also the possi—
bility of ERC men majoring in
science or math remaining for the
whole semester.

The Enlisted Reserve Air Corps
members received notice for active
duty sometime before March 1.
These orders came through Tuesday.
Although the army continued their
usual vagueness with these orders,
the members in this reserve can
be expected to leave anytime within
the coming three weeks.

Another phase of the situation
was presented Wednesday when Dr.
Milton G. Nelson, Dean of the Col-
lege, met with the 16 math-science
majors. According to one of the
many communiques received by the
Dean. those students in the ERC
who are pursuing approved tech-
nical engineering courses may com-
plete any semester which they be-
gan since January 1.

Although this is not certain, the
wording of the report is such that
these few students may fall into this
category. And a taboo is put on
the idea of changing a major since
the record in possession of the army
has the major of a student as of the
beginning of the semester in Sep-
tember. It applies alike to Sopho-
mores. Juniors and Seniors.

"Meteot'ogical acceptees most like—
ly will not be called to active duty
before beginning their course,” said
the Dean at the meeting. However,
if they should be called, they will
indulge in basic training until the
course opens.

The remaining ERC students are
living in hourly expectation of re-
ceiving their orders. These may
come with 24-hour notice or 1.0 days.

State College has also been put
on the approval list for training of
aviation cadets. 281 training in-
stitutions of the country were
named. However, this does not
mean that cadets will enter the col-
lege. Only a relatively small num-
ber of those named will be used for
such purposes. and the odds are that
State will not be one of them.

tO-piecc orchestra will furnish
music for the Prom. Featuring Lee
Sherman as vocalist, Parker’s band
is one of the most popular of the
district. having played at Colgate.
Hamilton. Union, R.P.I.. Russell
Sage. St. Rose. and the Albany
Country Club. The outfit plays fox
trots. waltzcs, rhumbas and other

Bids are at an unusually low

yet have not obtained theirs, they
will be sold at the door.

Following the rule of most pre—
vious dances this year. the affair
will be semi-formal, lasting from
9 P. M. to l A. M.

The Coronation

The haunting crescendo of a tenor
sax—41 boogie-woogie beat an ivory

a slippery lloor—»--ull these will be
part of the Junior Prom tomorrow
night.

To one girl this dance will be a
great occasion—perhaps the most
thrilling episode of her college
career. It will be HER night, for
she will be crowned Queen of the
Junior Prom. selected for her beauty
and popularity from all the women

 

of the Class of '44. It is an honor
dreamed of by every entering co-ed.
destined to become a reality to only
one. And who that one will be is
a secret guarded by know-all Mys-
kania, not to be reveach until time
for the coronation.

This year there are six aspirants
to the coveted throne. chosen by a
preliminary vote of the class. They
arc: ’l‘rcce Aney. Georgia I'Iardesty,
Pat Latimer. Ginny Moshak, Mary
Studebaker. and Mildred Wirosloff.
Certainly we can’t go wrong with
such a pulchritudinous group as
that!

It is even possible to compare
these bcautcous contestants to the
queens of history. Petite Georgia
I‘lardesty brings- to mind Mary of
Scotland. envied by Elizabeth for
her auburn hair. the proud tilt of
her chin, her sincere friendliness.
Wonder what Bothwell would have
done if Georgia had been around?

Something about 'l‘rece reminds
us of—«yeS—Cleopatru! Now there
was a woman with beauty and
brains and ambition, all rolled in
one snappy package. She managed

Don Cossack Chorus
To Appear Feb. 27

Music Council will present the
famed Don Cossack Chorus under
the direction of Serge Jaron on
February 27th in the Page Hall
auditorium. The program begin-
ning at 8:30 P. M. will include thir-
teen numbers and two intermissions.

The chorus was formerly the
Cossack Guard under the old Czar
in Russia. For twenty years the
men have been travelling under the
strictest army discipline. These 32
White Russians have kept to their
former routine as much as possible,
but were forced to cut their beards
because of the protested abuse.

This group is characterized by
their extreme vitality and exuber—
ance and their remarkable choral
technique has won for them the ap-
proval of large audiences. Besides
the group dances their repertoire
includes liturgical music, and un»
usual rhythms in the gay songs of
gypsies, and boatmen.
