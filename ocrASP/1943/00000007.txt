SCT Comes Through

Great was the speculation as to the outcome
of the WACsmotivated State Fair. Great were
the apprehensions and the difﬁculties. But the
results proved that the worry had been in vain.
Once more the student body of State [College
turned out lull force to make yet another project
a complete social and ﬁnancial success. Faculty
member and student alike pulled together for
an evening of fun and painless contribution to
the war effort.

The rpessimists who gloomily predicted tlte
failure of the project were sadly off tlte beam.
State has spirit and lots of it! Congratulations
are in order to the students for their cooperation
and willingness. The achievement unquestion-
ably warrants art annual repetition of the event.
in the opinion of many, the affair was second in
importance to nothing but Moving-Up Day.
And the triumph was in no small measure due
to War Activities Council. More lxnver to ill

Ode to the Junior Class

In many ways, at many times, the praise has
sounded loud

For the mighty feats of ’44, a most unusual
crowdl

We think the applause is well deserved

At this or any time,

To you we’ll raise our hearts and cheers

in prose, in song, in wine.

'lhe past has been brilliant, the present the

 

 

same,

.\lay the unattaincd future keep stainless our
name.

State will long remember the record we leave
behind,

()ur match lll spirit and intellect will be very
hard to find.

To those who've gone, to those wlto will leave.

'l‘o those who will remain,

'l'o each attd every "ill—

(loud lurk—we'll meet again!

Should Auld Acquaintances

Midst tlte singing of songs and the recalling
of such memories as the time (lambs and Forrest
were "hog-tied” and thrown on the stage during
Assemtbly or the time the Sophs locked tts lit the
balcony during Assembly and the key remained
mysterioust lost until in. Nelson miraculously
turttcd it up. the (Jlass of ill-M will banquet this
cvcning at I“I(.‘l‘l)L'l'l.'§.

'l'his banquet will be the first get-togctltcr
that the present Junior (liass has ever spott-
sored; it will also be the last get-together for
some of the men with their classmates for a
long time.

The (.‘lass of “M has never lacked spirit; it has
possessed it in abundance. Let’s make the ban-
tuet a roaring success, a pleasant memory for
those men to tarry with them until they return
to the bosom of their Alma Mater.

 
 
 
 

Emits Fet' Inbaum

The Russians are proving that
they can capture towns faster than
people can pronounce them. Al-
though daily Russian communiques
announce the capture of more and
more towns and villages these local—
ities are not important in them-
selves, but are valuable because
they are railroad junctilons and
control the lines of supplies. Rus-
sian frontal assaults against German
strong oints last Spring were un-
success I. This time the Red Army
is advoidlng costly attacks against
the enemy's front, and is ﬁghting a
battle of encirclement and cutting
the Germans’ supply lines. The
Russians are advancing upon Kar-
kov from the North and South but
not from the East. The southern
drive is reported within 22 miles
from the city. The Germans are
offering stiffer resistance at Rostov
while the Russians are attempting
to encircle the city from the North.

North Africa

General Alexander, British Mid-
dle East commander, reported from
Cairo that General B. L. Montgom-
ery’s powerful 8th Army was now
advancing into Southern Tunisia.
Rommel is feverishly working to
prepare the Mareth Line in attempt
to stop the British advance.

Although some of its units may
be sent elsewhere and many of its
veterans may be returned to Britain
or the Dominions, the British 8th
Army will remain a ﬁghting force
after Africa falls and will be avail-
able for an invasion of Europe
where and when the high command
thinks best. Augmenting this po-

 

Russians Stage. Frontal/Assaults,-
Capture ‘ Many Railroad Junctions

tential striking force will be a
large proportion of the British and
American units now ﬁghting in
Tunisia. This, in effect, was what
General Alexander told correspond-
ents. He acknowledged the_ diffi-
culties caused by heavy rams in
Tunisia, but he is certain that the
Allied operations in North Africa
will end in the expulsion, capture,
or destruction of the Axis forces
there.

South Paciﬁc

The Japanese High Command~ ad-
mitted that they had evacuated their
forces from Guadalcanal and from
the Buna area of New Guinea.
General MacArthur had announced
three weeks ago that Australian and
American forces had killed.15,000
Japs and captured that important
Jap beachhead. Allied aircraft had
prevented the Japs time after time
from landing reinforcements on both
these positions. General MacArthur
also reported that the attacks against
the Japs on the Island of New
Guinia are progressing satisfactorily.

Peace Forums

The PM newspaper has been de-
voting several of its pages to Peace
Forums. Prominent men and women
have expressed their views and
opinions on such subjects as what
to do with the conquered territories,
post-war economic problems, and
reconstruction. Our big job right
now is to concentrate on winning
the war, but let’s break the ground
for some heavy concentrating on
winning and maintaining the peace
after the war.

 

Orchids and Onions

 

Two plays were given
The one I liked:
T‘other I did’n,

The first play of the evening, un—
der the direction of Ruth Sehmitt,
was a noble attempt to create some-
thing from nothing. The paramount
defect was the play itself; it died a
painfully slow death caused by ex-
cessive use of drugs. Still, the
actors might have realized that they
were playing to an audience. They
all had their moments, but there
were times when they might have
pulled the play from the doldrums
and didn’t, especially during the
ﬁnal scene.

Harley Dingman startled the
audience into good humor during
intermission. His, shall I say,

by Betty Marsion

 

“unique” interpretation of the “In-
dian War Dance" should echo into
a State tradition.

The second production was di—
rected by Vera Willard, who has my
congratulations for attempting an
expressionislic play and making it
successful. The acting of both
Elaine Drooz and Marie Joyce was
superb, particularly in respect to
their voice projection. And the
two male voices, being Bert Kiley
and Fred Crosby, expressed their
characters beautifully. Above all,
a curtain call should be taken by
the sets and lights. Both were per-
fect adding atmosphere and mood
through the symbolism in design to
the drama.

Quite pleasing entertainment.

 

We Can’t Take It

We’re not trying to imitate the
Seniors, albeit our odes, prophecies,
and histories. On the contrary, we
are simply recognizing that this is
a war year, that, therefore, things
are different, and that to many of
us the events of the past few weeks
will be the last of our college days.
So here and now, we, the Class of
1944, wish to make and declare
this to be our semi-final will and
testament in form and manners as
follows:

To the Seniors—our thanks for
many pleasant memories, many
good friends. Our best wishes for
good fortune no matter what the
future holds.

To the Sophomores we wish to
leave the example we have set for
them in sportsmanship, spirit, and
wit. We think that '45 has possi-
bilities; we hope that they will
develop them.

To the froshwwell, they're still
sort of an unknown quantity, but
they’ve showed fight. they've got
brawn, so we leave them our brains.
After all, with '44 as a sister class,
'46 can’t go wrong. (Or can it?)

To the Sophomore Desk Editors,
the Junior Associate Editors leave
their efficiency, their initiative, their
ingenuity. May they keep high the
torch we throw to them. To the
freshman Aspirants, well, we be—
queath the “ashes and sparks” that
fall in the course of our meteoric
careers. They may only become
little comets, but we can’t all be
planets.

To future dramatic artists, the
greasepaint crew of ’44 leaves its
record of Page Hall triumphs. May
they equal, if possible. the achieve-

Wifh Us

merits of Hal Ashworth, Paul Bar-
selou, Trece Aney, Mary Stude—
baker, Lois Hampel, Shirley Mills,
Eunice Baird, Ruth Schmitt. Vera
Willard, Marge Breunig. Catherine
Smith, Jeanne Bailey, Jim Mc-
Feeley, and the rest of the Junior
dramatic wizards.

In the athletic department, we
leave to up and coming muscle men
and women the prowess of Mary
Domann, Kit I'Ierdmtm, Jane Pick-
ert, Dot Townsend, Rita Duly, June
Clark, Dollie Simmons, Bob Combs.
Bill Marsland. Rich Young, Hank

and Charlie Capel.

’I‘o neophyte musicians we. be-
queath the artistry of Earle Snow,
Nancy Wilcox, Helen Elgin, Jane
Southwick, Carm Losurdo, Verne
Marshall and Gerry Merhofl'.

’l‘o embryonic wits and intellect—
uals, we leave the humor and brains
of Rhona Ryan, Bert Kiley. Ray
Verrey, Betty Gravelle, Ruth Yutzi-
ler, Graham Duncan, I'lelcu Bruc—
lcer and Fred Beyer. lt‘or ambi-
tious paint-daubers, we set forth
the palettes used by Honey Schoen
and Sally Richards. To future
glamor-girls. the beauty of Georgia
Ilardesty, Pal Latlmcr, Millie Wir-
osloll', Ginny Mostthak, Lucille
Cranls, Carolyn Lively, and Shirley
Reed. I

The executive ability and leather-
shtp of young. Shoemaker, Ash—
worth, and Laiimer we bequeath
to present and future presidents
and organization heads.

Having exhausted our resources
and patience, we, the class of 1944,
affix our signatures to this docu«
merit and call it quits.

Sayles Stresses Teacher's Role

During Post-War Reconstruction

This is the second in a series of
articles which will appear in the
News on “Why Remain in Teach-
ing?” They are written by eminent
members of the faculty. This article
is by Dr. John M. Sayles, President
of the College.

“The educational process is a pro—
gram by which ideas are spread,
by which plans are formulated,
through which directions are given,
and by which institutions are or-
ganized and planned results ob—
tained.

“There are two things immedi-
ately ahead of us, both of which
have to do with winning. First, we
have to win the war. Second. we
have to win the peace. After that
peace is gained, we have to recon-
struct a society.

“The educational process by
which society will be reconstructed
has many approaches. It will be
done through the pulpit, public
platform, daily press, moving-pic-
ture, and through the very formal
process of the daily classroom. That
gives to teaching a very formal
function and makes the teacher a
very important person.

“That person who is going to
be the teacher in our future so-
ciety should be well-informed and
socially—minded about his commun-
ity, state, and nation. He should
acquire deﬁnite ideas and ideals
about the kind of state which he
wishes to have and concerning the
formation of which he wishes to

 

have a part. That is why I believe
that the teaching process is impor-
tant.

(When Dr. Sayles was asked why
he had remained in the teaching
profession instead of pursuing a
promising career as a hotel admin-
istrator, he replied that it was a
rather difficult question for him to
answer.)

“Most of us chose more or less
unconsciously. I believe that there
is an innate search for beauty in all
of us. We strive to express beauty
in many ways.

“Each day’s program is one of
choice. We must choose to do
something worthwhile, not just
whims. We are responsible for some
things, and we have to direct that
responsibility. With this daily
choosing we have to have the abil-
ity to decide on a plan which may
be modiﬁed from time to time, and
also the ability to adhere to our
plans although others may criticize.

“Our choice is the result of this
innate search for beauty. The edu-
cational process is slow. You can’t
becotne discouraged or you’ll lose
the process. To express this beauty
is often a process of planting and
the repetition of varied approach
not only to achieve satisfaction for
ourselves but also to educate others
to appreciate what we have sought
and obtained.

“It is part of our program as
teachers to direct this daily choice
and to cultivate more desirable and
a higher sense of beauty.”

By Sunnn Cooper

Dr. Lester is the first woman
faculty member to join the United
States Coast Guard Reserves. She
has always wanted to be in the
navy. and now she is about to fulfill
this desire that once seemed so
fantastic.

[)r. Lester, a graduate of Cornell.
got her Phi). at the University of
Wisconsin in l937. Her college
days were full of the same activity
that characterizes her here. She
was a member of the Cornell Dra—
tnatics Society, manager of hockey.

Dr. Lester received her orders
Monday afternoon, as much sur-
prised as everyone else. She is
quite proud of the fact that the
SPARS are particularly favored by
being trained at the same place as
the men Coast Guard oiliccrs.

Anxious to get to New London
and to get "into the fight." she will
ttch-rihcless miss her friends here.
But it is with a challenging flip—
paney that she says. “This is not
good-bye. It's au revoir, I'm com—
ing back."
