‘ mm -

, is one of

bers of 'th' 3 Army '

 

that State? College sports has. re

'ceived this year. Added to the cer-

tain callipg‘of the ERC’s in the near

’ future, It seems to us to sound the

death knell of varsity sports. The

results on the intramural setup are

.ju‘npredic‘table. .

,, In other words, it seems to be a
pretty ‘safe- bet that sports at State
for he duration-will co'nmst of gym
,classesg‘wonXen's, and possibly some
intramurf jl'action' by the 44""5, 2-
’ s‘iand'freshmen.   ..

f“; We“ choc-include this yeartin
this sweeping prediction, for there
is» nothing yet which will prevent

 

: the Completion of- this year's sched-

ule. (For ‘such small crumbs. as
this we must be duly appreciative.
C’est la guerre!)

S rts in Particular

l)lgowlinga—last year’s addition 
the intramural program—is again
due to get going. At the last coun—
cil meeting, the representatives all

-, promised a team. Rice’s alleys are:

being dickered for. In about three
days the league should be ready to
roll. Let’s support this league as
well as we do the others and as
well as was done last year.

‘ Basketball—Varsity

The general concensus of opinion
is that the boys were missing some-
thing besides the basket last Satur-
day night. Speciﬁcally, the old 21p,
drive, heart, whatever you want to
call it, was lacking. For the ﬁrst
time this year, the team didn’t seem
to ﬁght.

And we say, “Don’t blame only
the varsity.” We have never seen
more lethargic stands than those at
a State basketball game. It really
helps a team a lot to know that
spectators are rooting or them. How
about forgetting our professional
attitudes and dignities for a while
and letting out a good old-fashioned
yell? '

Add a Bit of Humor

We really climaxed a none too
successful basketball career last
Thursday when we did our best to
score a basket for the opposition.

, We thank our lucky stars that, as

” 'usual, the shot rolled around the

rim and dropped outside.
Council Organizing
l-M Bowling League

Intramural council has announced
its intention to begin the bowling

-' league as soon as possible. Although

confronted with the growing prob-

» lem of lack of men athletes, all the

' Johnston and promises

present intramural teams expect to
have entries in the competition.

Clancy Carr, who has been ap-
pointed head of the bowling league,
expects the ﬁrst matches to be
playednext week. He added a dour
note, however, by saying, “Of course
the calling of the EKG and the
Aviation Cadets renders impossible
any predictions as to how the season
will eventually culminate."

The teams expected to enter are
Potter Club, last year's trophy win-
ners. KDR, KB, SLS, the Ramblers,
the Finks, and the Dorm.

Art Flax was placed in charge of
organizing an elimination ping-pong
tournament.

Ben Reed is a new member of in-
tramural council. He has taken
Ernie Mennillo's place as represen-
tative of the Finks, and has also
taken Mcnillo's place as council
treasurer.

Camp Johnston Weekend Planned

WAA is planning a special week-
end at Camp Johnston over Wash—
ington’s Birthday, from Friday,

 

February 19, to Monday, February
' 22.

The price is $1.50 per person,
which includes round-trip trainfare.
This is an increase of only $1.25 over
the usual price for a three-day

‘ weekend. The girls leave at about

5:30 RM. on Friday and return
Monday afternoon.

Pat Frey is in charge of Camp
that the
principal recreations will be loafing
and winter sports. The major
change from other seasons is the
curtailment of the grocery boy’s
gasoline, which provides the girls
with the added exercise of toting
their provisions out from the nearby
town.

Tonight the Eagles will face the

most formidable foe they have yet .

encountered, for Niagara. Univer-
sity, beaten only three times this
year in competitionwith the best
teams of the nation, is slated to ap-
pear on the Page Hall court. If some
miracle happened, even greater than
that one three years ago, by virtue
of which State won a one point vic-
tory, it would be the major basket-
ball upset of the year. I

Next Wednesday St. Michaed’s
will pay its annual visit to Albany
to play the Eagles, who defeated
them handily last year. St. Mich~
ael’s has had little success this year
so far, having a record similar to
our own.

There is a great deal of doubt
concerning the presence of some of
the varsity players at this but sev-
eral of the JV’s will be able to take
their places, perhaps more ably than
they.

Last week the Statesmen played
one of the most pathetic contests
ever witnessed on the Page Hall
court, losing 61-35. The blame for
this failure can hardly be placed en-
tirely with the players, for when
what is known as the “varsity”
players had a chance to perform—
the ﬁrst, third, and fourth quarters
—Pratt was pressed to the limit.

The height, impregnable zone,
and ability to score at will against
State’s feeble reserves produced a
run-away before the half. A pep
talk, the return of the ﬁrst string
players to the lineup, and despera-
tion, however produced a much
closer second half and prevented
the complete loss of prestige.

Raphael and Kaplowitz, a Pratt
substitute, took scoring honors for
the night. Hansen, Combs, and
Mullin netted the lion’s share of
State’s points, which was only a
mouse’s share of the games.

 

Psi Gamma Wins in Bowling

The WAA bowling tourney which
got off to such a good start last
February 2 is still rolling along
smoothly.

Last Thursday, two more league
games were played, only one of
which was completed. Psi Gamma
defeated Cooper House, in two out
of three games. The Kappa Delta-
Moreland Hall game was not com-
pleted however, and this game will
be ﬁnished up by tonight.

Renaming their schedule last
Wednesday, the Junior Varsity baa-
ketlialllét‘eiam lost to the Slena Col-~
to e J; V. team, 29-18, for. their
ﬁ ', loss of the season.

The Eaglets, ﬁghting for their

ﬁfth win of the campaign, manage

to keep close enough during the
initial half, trailing by only two
points at the intermission, but, tired
by a large unfamiliar court, failed
to match the opposition’s counters
during the ﬁnal period. Hippick
and Riccardo were high for State
with ﬁve points each.

In a previous meeting this year,
the Purple and Gold handed Siena
its lone loss of the year.

The'jayvees resume activity to-
night with a return match with
Pharmacy College. '

Finks, KB, Potter
Win One Each

During the past week three games
were played in the Intramural lea-
gue and interest in the outcome is
growing as the half-way mark ap-
proaches. The various squads are
working together much better now
thanearlier in the season and the
next few weeks may show many
changes in the standings.

In the ﬁrst game played a week
ago yesterday KB scored a 16-10
win over SLS to take over third
place. The winners made the most
of Rabineau and Koblenz’s height
to control the ball off the backboard,
while the losers missed the services
of Buck Hippick who is now with
the JV’s. The game was featured
by a new low half—time score of 4-3
when a great number of shots were
missed by both, but the tempo be-
came slightly faster in the ﬁnal
quarters.

In the second game Potter Club
maintained its winning streak with
its ﬁfth victory, but found a ﬁght-
ing KDR team constantly at its
heels. The winners enjoyed only
a slight 15-13 margin after two
quarters and were almost tied early
in the fourth stanza when quick
baskets by Evans and Gipp put them
out in front for a 31-24 victory.
The State Street quintet showed
again its power to wear down its
opponents and it looks as though
they wind up the ﬁrst half of their
games without a loss. Gipp led the
scoring with 15 points, while Evans
and Baden garnered 9 apiece.

In an early game Monday evening
the Finks again hit the winning side
with a close 19-18 conquest over the
Dorm.

Gamer Rolling Along

As are the'rest of the WAA tour-
neys,.the basketball tournament is
in full swing. A great deal of in-
terest is shown in the sport, for a
la: ge number of girls come out for
the league games, held Wednesday
nights in the gym.

Last Wednes ay night, three more
league games were played. The
ﬁrst was a afst exciting game be-
tween Newman Hall and Beta Zeta.
With good guarding ‘and Garall’s 11
points leading them on to victory,
the Newman contingent emerged
victorious from the struggle with a
19-13 score.

The second game was a battle
between Cooper House and Delta
Beta Chi (formerly known as the
Dorm A team) Due to LaSalle’s 11

points, and the six points each of

Domann and Herdman,, Delta Beta
Chi triumphed to the tune of 23-18.
Much‘ interest is shown in this team
which won the trophy in last year's
tournament, and is well on its way
to a repeat performance of this deed,
being tied for ﬁrst place in the
league with Newman, both teams
having won their ﬁrst two games.

The third and ﬁnal game 0 the
evening was that between Wren
Hall and Moreland Hall. Much ex-
citement ensued in the ﬁnal quarter,
because of a tie score of 12-12. In
an overtime period, Wren gained
the lead with a foul shot and em-
erged triumphant over Moreland,
13-12.

WAA is getting up something new

' and different—a sleighrlde. All de-

pends, of course, on the weather, so
if you are interested, send up a
few prayers for some nice ﬂuffy
snow. The sleighride (if it goes
through) may take the place of
WAA’s annual banquet, plans for
which are somewhat frustrated by
the labor shortage and food prices,
(signs of the times). It hasn’t been
decided whether it’s for gals only.
(Although it Ercs us to say so, how
could it be otherwise?)

Pat Latimer also has a cheerful
bit for the would-be senior life
savers. Ten cents is to be refunded
for every hour of attendance in the
seventeen class course. This is a
fairly good cut of the twenty-cent
fee.

Nicest score of the weeknGarfall
bowls 199.

Added irony—in an outside-the-
league game.

It appears that some of you ping-
pong players haven’t noticed that a
tourney is on. Surely, more than a
dozen people want to enter. Don’t
forget that only three supervised
hours are needed out of the ten re-
quired for credit. Let’s all get be-
hind the ping—pong tournament and

make it something for future sea--

sons to aim at.

WAA is really on the half this
season. Have you seen the list of

Lady Macbeth has the most beauti—

two iridescent saucers.

She is grand of stature, and seep-

issues Appeal

For Volunteers
Student Help Needed

For Local Ration Boards

At its Wednesday meeting, War
Council discussed the need for more
participation in War Activities by
students of the college. Albany or-
ganizations have issued an appeal
for help, and patriotic students are
asked to volunteer.

There is on immediate need for
guides in next week's rationing cen—
ters. The interceptor Command
and the Information Center both
need helpers; the Red Cross wants
typists to prepare for next month's
drive, nursery schools need assist—
ants. bandages are being rolled
daily in the Courthouse from 2-4
P. M., and 7—9 F. M.

Schedule (.‘omplications

Schedulc complications often make
it (liliicull for students to do as
much war work as they would like.
A wide variety of war work is of-
f'crcd so that students should be able
lo find one convenient time for
work. This applies especially to
commuters who find it hard to at-
icnd evening meetings.

All voluntccrs for war work will
plousc scc Miss Stokes, Dean of the
(‘ollcgu in her Room 210 office. Im—
mediate hch is vitally needed.

War Council also plans to start
scrap drives for stockings, rags, fats,
and olllcl' molt-rials in the near fu—
turc.

Student Council has appointed a
commiltcc lo invcstigatc means of
distributing the money, totalling
$100 profit. rcccivcd from the State
Fair. The committee consists of
Patricia Latimer. Hannclorc Schoen
and Fred Shoenuikcr, juniors, and
liolf 'l‘ocpfcr. '43.

This committee was appointed by
Student Council as a result of a
un.lion in lusl Friday's assembly to
that effect. Since the student body
could not ngrcc last Friday as to
how the money should be disposed
of, this committee was appointed for
lllt‘ purpose of investigating various
t'cllcf funds in which the money
could be donated.

in rcgurd to helping in the ra-
uoning program next week, any one
who is inlermlcd should contact
Miss Stokes as quickly as possible.
Since both Albany High School and
llic Milnc School are ccnlcrs for thc
inlioulng program, students will not
lch lo go loo for out of their way
It! order to help in llll.‘ war effort,
