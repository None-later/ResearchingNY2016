STATE COLLEGE NEWS, FRIDAY FEBRUARY 19, 1943

War Fronts by Feigenbaum

Rommel Offense in North Africa
Makes Bid for Elbow Room

Nazi Marshal Erwin Rommel has
smashed an American attempt to
isolate his Africa Korps in Southern
Tunisia, and has attacked in Cen-
tral Tunisia, driving the American
forces back thirty-ﬁve miles in
three days. Led by veteran tank
fighters and using ﬁfty-ton Mark VI
tanks, the Germans have forced the
AEF to evacuate three advanced
airfields in Central Tunisia.

Rommel and the German army in
Northern Tunisia are lashing out
in desperation. They are still trapped
between the jaws of a powerful
nutcracker. In the southern Tunis-
ian sector the powerful and victori-
ous British 8th Army of General
Sir Bernard L. Montgomery was
reported to be moving toward the
Mareth Line preparing to crack it
in the center. An assault upon the
Mareth Line would force Rommel
to recall those forces which have
driven the Americans back in the
central part of the line.

The German offensive against the
AEF has gained some more elbow
room for the Nazis. and has pre-
vented the Americans from dividing
the German forces in Tunisia. How-
ever, this local victory does not
change the military situation very
Inuch except to make the job of
driving the Germans out of Africa
that much harder. The entire Ger-
man campaign in Africa now is to
delay the Allies until Hitler can
prepare his defenses in Europe
against a United Nations' invasion
of the contingent when Africa has
been completely conquered.
ltussiu

The Red Army is still pushing thc
Nazis back on the central front, and
are slowly but relentlessly closing

a gigantic pincers movement around
the Nazi forces in the Donets Basin.
The Russian columns which cap-
tured the city of Kharkov have
rolled on thirty-two miles west of
the city. The speed of the German
retreat in this section indicates that
they are falling back to prepared
defense positions. The Red Army
is trying to turn the retreat into a
disorderly rout. but unfortunately,
the Germans are withdrawing in
good order taking the major part of
their equipment with them.

In the Donets Basin it is a differ-
ent situation. The resistance of the
Nazis is desperate and hard but un—
availing. A Russian force is driving
on the city of Stalino the anchor of
the German defense in the Donets
Basin. Should the Russians succeed
in taking the city the 250,000 Nazis
would be entirely surrounded.

A German Dunkirk is being on-
actcd in the Caucasian Mountain
district. The Germans are trying
to evacuate their forces across the
Crimean and Kerch Pcninsulas, but
the Russian Black Sea fleet in con-
junction wuh the Red Army air-
force is taking a tci'rific toll of the
retreating army.

‘A

Madame Chiang Kai—Slick has
come to the United States to ask
for aid for China. Thc wife of
China’s Gcncralissimo told the
House of Representatives that her
country will uphold the principles
of the United Nations' Declaration
and will light to the end. Shc
warned the chrcscntzitives that
Japan luis greater resources than
GcrInIIny,nnd if allowed to dcvclop
them the Japanese will make them—
selves almost impossible to defeat.

Like the Milleritcs of non—ascension fame. the ERCs
(being informed by the experts as to the chosen day)
put on their robes and awaited the call—but not on
the top of a mountain. Some. desiring a pre-induction
vacation, obtained leaves of absences, and later found
themselves up the well known crick. For the day
came & went, but still no sign. So the ERCs (except
those getting the abscntia now non gratin) still cling
to their robes, instead of textbooks. and await the
call-~but not on the top of a mountain. . . .

Had thc bnskcthnll team played
as good ball against all their op-
ponents this year as they did against
Niagara last Friday night. their win
and loss record would be far more
imprcssivc.

Niagara, as expected. proved too
much for them and they showed
that before the game was half over.
In the second quarter they out-
scored our varsity 25-9 as they
throw in deadly pops over State's
zone defense.

The Eagles played just about the
best brand of basketball that they
were able. That they lost was ill-
cvitablc. However, this was one
game in which we lost no pride in
watching II antc tI-Iim go down in
defeat.

Sincere thanks must be I‘Xlil'l‘bhl’tl
to Mr. Bulgcr who acted us "couch

because Milne also played that night
and Coach Grognn was needed In

K-B Hands Potter
First I-M Defeat

Intramural Basketball saw the
first half of its schedule completed
during the past week and the second
started in spite of a predicted man-
shortage.

A week ago yesterday the Ram-
blers broke a 6-6 halftime tie with
SLS to turn in an 18-14 win as
MacLarcn found the basket for 8
points. In the second game KB
handed Potter its first defeat to the
tune of a 31-26 victory. The win-
ners. led by Rabineau with 9 points
turned the trick in the final minutes
after the lead had changed several
times to gain a third place berth.

It Could
Be

WUI’Z

 

 

Long and loud have been the re-
marks made by the women of State
about the physical prowess of State
men. Now. judging by an article
which recently appeared in Life, the
men have the right to call the State
women, "Sissies."

The article pictured the strenUOUS
activities of the girls at a New Eng-
land collegc. Garbed in shorts and
sweaters, these Amazons hiked
through the snow, did exercises in
the cold outdoors and climbed over
Commando walls.

Arc Statc women following the
example of these mighty maids?
No, they are not. Here the girls, if
they participate in any sports, find
pleasure in the good old pro-war
games of basketball. bowling and
fencing, and ping-pong. Should we
copy them? Certainly not—the wholc
thing sccms more than mildly silly.
Who cares if we never march across
the pages of Life? Let the men say
what they will. Wc'rc content to
be the intellectual typc.

Though WAA is not following
such II Spartan program, the winter
calendar i: full. This week the
ping-pong IIIIrncy takes its place
with the bowling and basketball
tournaments.

Little news arrives from the
Bowling front. None of the matches
played on Tuesday were completed.
Phi Delta won its first two games
from Cooper; Psi Gamma and Gain-
mII Kappa Phi each garnered n
gIImc.

WAA Court League
Completes Third Set

The third set of gzuncs of thc
WAA basketball league was played
off last chncsduy night in thc gym.

The first game was a fast and
furious bIIltlc bctwccn Newman Hall
and Coopci' House. There was con-
siderable rivalry in this gamc. with
both thIms playing as hard as pos-
sible. Cooper won by four points,
the score being 24-20. The winners
were pIIccrl by Hcrlihy who had 14
points, while Garfall, earning 9. was
high scorcr for NcwmIIn.

Wrcn Hull and Beta Zeta met in
the second game. Hard-fought IIc—
lion chIIrIIctcrich the play which
l't'htlllt‘d in II 13-11 victory for thc
Wrcn thIm. High scorers Wcrc
Make for BZ. and Seymour for the
Wren contingent.

The final game which was one
hctwcen PSl GIIInmII and Morclnnd
llnll. started off very slowly. At the
end of Ilic first quarter only three
points; had been scored. However.
the III-lion was soon spccdcd up and
II lively slrugglc developed. Murc—
lIIIId IlnIIllv emerged victorious with
it score of 2-1-Iil. Breunig starred
for the winning IeIIm. earning 18 of
the lI-IIIII'S Bl points. IIIId Pickcrt
won high scorer for l’si (.IIImInII.
