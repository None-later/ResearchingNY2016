STATE COLLEGE NEWS, FRIDAY,— FEBRUARY 19, 1943‘

Better Opportunities for Students
"With Master Degree, Says Nelson

This is the third in a series of
articles which will appear in the
News on “Why Remain in Teach—
ing?” They are written by eiitin'ent
members of the faculty. This article
is by Dr. Milton G. Nelson, Dean
of the College.

“After a superintendent of .a
school, where a teaching position is
vacant, certiﬁes to the state depart-
ment of education that he is unable
to ﬁnd a licensed teacher to ﬁll that
vacancy. he may hire a promismg
person who has completed her se—
nior year in preparation for teach—
ing. This person receives a tem-
porary license and thus becomes a
teacher. She receives an immedlate

    

return on her investment and gains
experience which will make ad-
vanced work more meaningful. She
helps to ﬁll an emergency situation
and has her chance to decide if
teaching is worthwhile. In addition
she becomes a year or more older
depending how long the emergency
continues. During this time, she
may become acquainted with the
young man sooner. so that advanced
work doesn't mean so much.

“There are certain disadvantages
to leaving college after four years
of training. As soon as the emer—
gency ends. temporary licenses ex~
pire. The teacher with a temporary
certiﬁcate must return to college to

complete her advanced work be-
cause the shortage will cease to
exist. After she has completed her
ﬁfth year of work, this same teacher
will enter the market when persons
returning from military and naval
service and industry will probably
form a glut of secondary school
teachers. This will mean that when
she finally comes out with her life
certiﬁcate, she will be competing in
a buyer’s market for teachers and
not in a seller’s market.

"However. if a student does her
ﬁfth year work immediately, it is
highly probable that she will earn
her life certiﬁcate to teach and will
enter the ﬁeld in a seller’s market.
All indications point to a continu—
ance of this world emergency be-
yond June 1944.

holds a life license to teach. and who
is doing satisfactory work can be

Forum Will Preview,

WAC Radio Program

“What is going to happen to Ger-
many and the German people after
the war?” This is a question that
has puzzled many, and in order to
start students thinking and discuss-
ing the problem. War Council has
planned a radio program early next
week which will take the form of
an extemporaneous panel discus-
sion.

To aid the students who will take
part in the discussion, the next
meeting of Forum will be a sound-
ing board. The members will hear
the discussion as proposed and offer
criticisms and suggestions for 1m-
proving it. The meeting will be
held next Wednesday in the Lounge

Some questions and answers of interest

to every patriotic college woman

The drilling sounds so strenuous—l

The, most beautiful women in America today

are the girls in khaki! Some calisthcnics and drilling are
vital to general good health, discipline and tuned-up reflexes.
After a few weeks at Fort Des Moincs, Daytona Beach or the
new Fort Oglethorpe training center you’ll feel better than

ever in your life.

Maybe I wouldn’t like the work?

People are happiest doing what they do well. Every effort
is made to place you where your service will count most
toward final Victory. You may have some latent talent that
will fill a particular need for work interesting and new to
women—such as repairing the famous secret boiiibsight,

rigD

ﬂing parachutes, operating the fascinating new electronic

devices —~ or driving an Army jeep over foreign terrain.

Then I have a chance to learn something new?

Yes, indeed. And the list of \VAAC duties grows constantly.
The training and experience you get in the WAAC may
equip you for many stimulating new careers opening up

for women.

What are my rhanees of promotion?

l'ixccllcnt. The Corps is expanding rapidly and needs new

officers, bolli commissioned and noncommissioiicd. Those

who join now have the best chances. All iicw officers now
come up thronin Illf' ranks. If qualified, you may obtain a

commission in I3 wccks after beginning basic training.

What in the aye ranye and other requirements?

Very simple. You may join if you arc. a U. S. citizen, aged
2| to If, inclusive, at least 5 feet tall and not over (i fact,

Professor of Education and Director
of Audio—visual Aids, will demon-
strate a Western Electric Mirro-
phone in Room 207 of Draper Hall
from Monday till Friday, 3:45 to
4:45 P. M.

"I would like," said Dr. Henrick-
son. “particularly to invite the stu-
dents of speech. music. and modern
language to attend. The machine
has great possibilities, I think,
especially in these fields. Also, any
members of the faculty who might
be interested are welcome."

The h/Iii‘i'ophonc. which records
sound for one minute. is a special
type of recording machine in that
it. uscs a metal tape rather than a
wax disc. This metal tape can be
used repeatedly.

In a Sophomore Ed. 10 section
Tuesday. Dr. Henrickson demon—
strated the machine so that students
could test their speaking and Sing-

also recorded during the demon—
sti'atioii.

The powerful Cossack chorus is
now making its thirteenth tour of
the United States. They last ap—
peared on the Page Hall stage in
October, 1938, at which time they
sang to a full house and received a
tremendous ovation.

This unusual group had its begin-
ning in a military camp of the Don
Valley. Serge Jarofi organized these
stalwart caviili'ymen into what. was
to become one of the most famous
choruses of the world. The Cos-
sacks havc travelled all over the
globe. having to date made almost
five thousand appearances.
Praised by Critics

Critics in every city which their
extended tours have included, have
praised them highly. The Toronto
Daily Star called them “the most
startling dynamo—choir that ever
sang in 'I‘oronto". The Dayton Daily
News said they were “a perfection
of sound and beauty". The San
Francisco News described them as
"truly superb singing organiza-
tion".

Tall. dressed in Russian costumes,
the Cossacks make a stirring ap-
pearance. Their songs are arranged
in six or eight parts, touching the
limits of the voice range. Their
voices are so powerful, it is said
"they can turn Madison Square
Garden into a telephone booth "

To Become U. S. Citizens

’I‘hcse Muscovitc melodists have
become very attached to the land
in which they have toured for the
last thirteen years. During the
summer they are quartered on the
Jersey coast where they prepare
their programs for the next season.
Last summer they had daily classes
for the entire company devoted to
the study of the Constitution of the
United States. Soon all of these
Don Valley natives will be U. S.
citizens.

State College students are priv—
licucd to hear the Cossack chorus
on their Student Tax tickets. Regu-
lar tickets are still on sale for $1.00.
Mindy Christians

Born in the gay and colorful
Vienna of yore. Miss Christians
iii-s1 stage appearance was in her
father's theater in a very minor role
as a princess. Both parents had
tried to discourage her theatrical
tllllli.fl<ill.\ and after tlial perform—
:iiicc, her father firmly stated that
she would make "an ideal house-
wife. cook. and mother of many
children but an ncti‘css 7 no". The
