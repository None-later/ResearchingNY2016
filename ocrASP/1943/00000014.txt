‘ Last Frida ’s Pratt contest wrote
This to th: Varsity basketball
schedule for this year and perhaps
for the duration. On the bass of
a win and loss record the basket-
ball season was far from impressrve.
On the basis of maintaining a team
and completing the schedule, it was
a complete success.

From'~ the very beginning the
1942-43 basketball schedule has
been “walking a tight rope”. Sched-
ule and transportation difficulties.
change in coaches, and the call of
players in the armed services have
all at one time or another threat-
ened .to disrupt the proceedings.
Despite these difficulties the sched-
ule was completed, and just in time.
Eagles Had Spirit

Though the Eagles were victori-
ous in only one contest, it was not
because they lacked a ﬁghting
spirit. In only one game did they
give up the ghost (the Brook-
lyn Poly game). Every contest found
the Purple and Gold representatives
ﬁghting to the very end. The
Eagles seemed to play their best
ball when they were behind. In
fact, they acquired the title of
second-half team.

Sincere gratitude and apprecia-
tion. are due to Coach Harry Gro-
gan.‘ At a time when the main-
tenance of basketball was seriously
threatened by Coach Hatfield's de—
parture, Mr. Grogan. upon request,
willingly undertook the job as the
Eagle’s mentor in addition to his
already full time job as Milne’s
physical instructor.

Grogan’s Contribution

For his extra duties as State’s
coach, Mr. Grogan is receiving no
monetary reward. His work with
the Purple and Gold cagers has
been entirely a personal contribu-
tion. Nor did he spare any efforts
in his new duties.

The present coach made arrange-
ments so as to devote as much time
to coaching the Varsity as Coach
Hatﬁeld did. Starting in the middle
of a season with a new squad is not
an easy assignment for anyone.
Without losing precious time, Coach
Grogan assumed his new duties the
very next day after former Coach
Hatﬁeld resigned, and has done a
swell job of it, even though victories
did not come this way.

Congratulations. C o a c h, and
thanks a lot!

Feminine Sextets

Fight for Lead

Basketball continues to be the
most popular women’s sport of the
season. The games this week were,
as usual, fast and were played with
a spirit of friendly rivalry pre-
dominating.

In the first encounter, the seeiii—
ingiy invincible Delta-Beta—Chi’s,
led by Domann who rolled up 24
points, defeated a peppy Psi Gam
team. The score, 34-27, is closer
than any made by D-N-C so far.
The game was exciting with both
teams sinking wild and impossible
shots. Slack was the star for Psi
Gam with 14 points.

The second contest had more ac-
tion than its low score would in-
dicate. Moreland eked out a 14-10
victory over Beta Zeta with Daly's
5 baskets pacing the winners.

The final game of the evening
saw Cooper House defeat Wren by
the score of 24-19. Hurlihy of
Cooper with 10 and Seymour of
Wren with 13 points led their re—
spective teams.

As the season progresses more
and more interest is shown in the
outcome of the league

M P's Defeat Potter

Albany MP's came to State last
Saturday afternoon and handed
Potter Club a fill—47 defeat. Fuch,
with 22 points and Dec with 18
points starred for the Army which
got off to an early lO-point lead
but Were held down the rest of the
game. Both of these men liaVe
played college basketball. Mullen,
Evans and Singer were the bright
lights in Potter with 13, 12 and 12
points respectively.

'EEP Leads L00p

Dorm Upsets KB,- 18-15,
Loses Io KDR ln Overtime

Monday eve the Finks topped the
winning crest of the Ramblers by
downing them 30-12. This defeat
dropped last week’s league leaders
to second spot, Potter moving to
top position. Getting the lead soon
after the tip-off, the victors took
a 12-7 halfway score and length-
ened it in the ﬁnal periods as they
ran through their opponents. Olivet
led his squad with 15 counters.

Last Thursday the Ramblers eked
a win over KDR in a rough and
tumble overtime battle. The Lake
St. quintet led at halftime but late
in the ﬁnal quarter the Ramblers
tied the score with two foul shots
at 15-all and in the extra three
minutes they got four points to their
opponents’ one to win, 19-16.

In the second game the Dorm
provided an upset in outscoring the
KB team 18-15. The winners were
held scoreless after the intermission,

but found their 18-7 lead sufficient
to allow them to coast along while
the losers played a poor brand of
ball, boih cflcnsively and defen—
sively.

In Tuesday's games Potter Club
regained its first place position by
scoring an all-out victory over the
SL8 aggregation. They established
a comfortable 31-12 lead in the ﬁrst
half and ran it into a 61—30 ﬁnal
score. “Red” Evans set up a new
individual scoring mark for a single
game with 23 counters, while two
teammates, Kiley and Singer, col-
lected 15 and 14 apiece. Ashworth
stood high for his team with 11.

In the other contest KDR scored
a thrilling overtime win over the
Dorm. After the lead alternated
each quarter and the winners gained
a 14-11 nod after two periods, Bom-
bard scored a hair—raising field goal
with three seconds left to knot the
game at 30-all.

Beach scored a lone basket in the
overtime to give KDR its 32-30 ad-
vantage. He also led the Lake
Sireeters with 11 points while Chel-
lemi put in 20 for the losing cause.

WSW

Last but not least, the Cagei'
Spotlight includes “Moose” Gerber
and Max Braun. Although neither
of the two have seen varsity action,
their presence on the team proved
helpful on many occasions. Moose
was incapacitated by an injury suf-
fered in the intramural football
season, while Max lacked the
necessary height and experience.

"Moose," playing for the third
year on the varsity, is the man who
showed his value by scoring eight
points in New York last Weekend.
It’s too bad we didn’t have him
around more often this year. His
left-handed ability would have
proved very valuable, He's in V-7.

Max showed his ability particu-
larly well in the Brooklyn Poly
game when he kept stealing the ball
from the opposition. A last man,
his natural ability was aided by a
year of experience with Sicna JV
before coming to State.

Max is a member of the EKG and
will probably be here until the end
of this semester.

 

 

 

RICE'S ALLEYS

15c a Game for School League
From 9:00 A. M. to 6:00 P. M.

 

 

Win One of Twelve;
Four Players Standout

The migrating Eagles have re-
turned from Brooklyn defeated in
their ﬁnale with the powerful Pratt
quintet. It was the second time
this season they succumbed to the
Techmen but this performance was
much more commendable than their
last. Instead of bearing a thirty-
point deﬁcit when the fortieth min-
ute passed, the Eagles were ﬁghting
and threatening Pratt’s nine-point
lead.

For the first time in many games,
State played “first half” ball reach-
ing the intermission in a 26-26
deadlock. In the third quarter they
assumed a two-point lead which
they held for some time, ﬁnally
relinquishing it as the ﬁnal period
began. Partly due to lack of sub-
stitutes and partly due to the size
of the court, the Statesmen tired,
and Pratt won.
ltuback Stars

Ruback displayed a little of last
year’s form as he netted ﬁfteen
points to surpass the 13 and 11 of
Hansen and Mullen. However. as
in the earlier game, the sharpshoot—
ing of Raphael and Kaplowitz
spelled disaster to the Eagle de—
fense, and constituted the difference.

The 51 points the Statesmen were
able to garner in this game swelled
their season’s total to 444 points as
compared to their opponents’ 644.
This 200~point difference tells the
story without a doubt for the points
meant 11 loses in 12 games; the
only win being a one-point victory
over our arch rivals, RPI.

Bright Spots

Throughout the twelve games the
only bright spots were the victory
over RPI and the showing against
Niagara. to whom victory was con-
ceded far in advance.
ceded far in advance. At times the
team showed ﬂashes of first rate
basketball with Combs, Hansen,
Marsland, and Mullin forming the
spearhead of the Eagles’ sporadic
attack. Since one of the scorebooks
was misplaced, the box scores of
several games are not available.
but as far as can be ascertained,
Hansen, Combs, and Mullin, in that
order, were the high scorers of the
season.

The second girl’s Rivalry bas-
ketball game is over. Excite-
ment has died down and ’45 and
’46 are friends(?) again. And
who are the better players? Well,
don’t ask a soph or a frosh if
you want an unbiased answer.

So. just let the facts speak for

emselves. The Crimson Tide
defeated the girls in blue with
a score of 33 to 25. Garfall. the
“vim, vigor and vitality” gal of
’45, was the star of the game,
gaining 24 of the Sophomore
team’s points. The sparkplug of
the Blue team was Helen Slack
who annexed 16 points.

The future looks very blue for
the fresh—but, cheer up, ’46!
You should have seen what ’44
did to the frosh last year.

As the race for the Intramural

other race, that for scoring leader—
ship, shares the spotlight. Dick
Chillemi, sparkplug of the Dorm
cagers, took over the lead in this
race when he scored 20 points to
bring his season’s total to 81.
His closest rivals are Dingman
of the Ramblers with 67 points, and
Gipp and Olivet of EEP and the
Finks respectively with 59 points
each.

In considering points scored it is
important to note also the number
of games played. Chillemi’s 10.2
average for eight games is also high.
although in four games Evans has
maintained almost the same aver—
age.

Publicity Group
Holds Meeting,

Formulates Plans
Schroon Lake SeniOrs

To Make Tour of State

The committee appointed last
Week by Dr. John M. Sayles, Presi-
dent of the College, for the purpose
of publicizing State College and its
facilities, met twice this last week.
This committee. after considerable
discussion, turned out several ideas
which, if put in working order,
should help the college to attain its
goal of 400 freshmen next fall.

Inspiration for one of these plans
was the impending arrival in Albany
of a group of Schroon Lake high
school seniors, who are making
an annual Spring trip to Albany
rather than to Washington. In ad—
dition to the usual sight—seeing
tours, they will be shown through
State College. The Junior Guides
will show them through the build—
ings and point out places of interest.
Patricia Latimer, '44, as chairman
of the Junior Advisers, will be in
charge of this project. The high
school seniors will be entertained
at Sayles Hall and cat Sunday din—
ncr there. The project is scheduled
for this week-end.

High School Visits

The Publicity Committee intends
to contact the Albany Chamber of
Commerce to suggest that. other
high school classes in the state also
make Albany the destination of
their annual trips. The college
would then go through the same
procedure for those other schools,
giving itself valuable publicity by
placing itself before the eyes of high
school seniors.

Dr. Milton G. Nelson, Dean, has
submitted the list of applicants for
admission before the Committee and
plans are being made to contact
Stale College alumni residing in the
towns where those applicants live,
in order to inform and interest these
applicants in the college. Mrs. Ag—
nes Underwood. Sccrctai‘y to the
Alumni Association, has prepared a
form letter which will be typed out
by members of the Commerce De-
partment. Mr. James Gcnimoll, Iii-
slructor of Commerce, will be in
charge of this typing project.
.luiiior Guides Will Aid

In addition to the itinerant inter-
views which will be conducted by
Dr. Nelson, there will also be inter-
views here at the College itself.
The Junior Advisors will aid in
this by taking the applicants on
lours of the Collcgc. In regard to
admission requirements, Dr. Nelson
wishes lo emphasize the changes
which will allow more students to
apply for admission

Another plan for publicizing col-
lege facilities consists of sending
more articles Io home town and

Student Assembly to Vote
On Three Amendments

 

DR. WATT STEWART, Professor of
History, who will replace Dr. Don—
nal V. Smith as Chairman of the
Department of Social Studies next
September.

 

Stewart Named

Department Head

Will Succeed Smith

in Social Studies Post

Dr. John M. Sayles. President of
the College. this week appointed
Dr Watt Stewart. Professor of His-
tory. as Chairman of the Depart-
ment of Social Studies. The
appointment will become effective
ncxl Seplcnibcr and will fill the
vacancy created by the appointment
of Dr. D. V. Smith. Professor of
Social Studies. as President of
Cortland State Teachers College by
the Board of Regents of the Univer—
sity of the State of New York.

Dr. Stewart came to State College
in the fall of 1940 from Oklahoma
Agricultural and Mechanical Col-
lege where he had been teaching
for twelve years. He earned his
doctorate at the University of Chi—
cago. It was there that he developed
his intense interest in South Anieri—
can history and affairs. Since com-
ing to Stale College this interest has
culminated in a book, Builders of
Latin America. written in collabora—
lion with H. F. Petersen of Buffalo
Slate Teacher’s College.

Prior to entering the teaching
profession, Dr. Stewart was editor
of a small town newspaper and an
officer during World War I. His
teaching experiences have varied
from teaching a back hills grade
school as a hiin school student in
earning a teaching fellowship and
directing a teacher's college history
department.

ERCS to Receive Orders
Within Week or 10 Days

Dr. Milton G. Nelson, Dean of
the College, yesterday received a
communication from the Head-
quarters of the Second Service
Command. which read in part as
follows:

"Members of the Enlisted Re-
serve Corps who will be ordered
to duty by this Headquarters will
begin to receive their orders
within the next week or ten days.
There will be approximately two
weeks time between the date of
issuance of such orders and the
date upon which they will report
for duty.

“If students remain in College
awaiting receipt of these orders,
they should make definite ar-
rangements at their homes for the
immediate forwarding of all offi-
cial correspondence.”

What will be the fate of stu-
dciits who are majors in Science
and Mathematics is iiol yet de-
cided. The directive received yes-
terday seemed to apply only to
those in fields other than those
mentioned above. Nothing can be
determined until the actual orders
arrive.

vanced Dramatics plays will be pre—

VOL. XXVII. NO. 20

Resolution: to Propose

Finance Board Changes

Members of Student Association
in this morning’s assembly will pass
judgment on three amendments to
the Student Association Constitu-
ioii. introduced on February 26.

The ﬁrst of the two resolutions
introduced by Harold Ashworth, ’44.
for Student Council pertains to
Finance Board. This resolution
would completely abolish Article IX
of the Constitution. substituting in-
stead three separate sections which
would also include the material now
in the Article.

Section 1 of the Amendment
reads: “All expenses of the Asso-
ciation and all authorized indebted-
ness shall be met by a per capita
tax, levied annually." This is as
the Constitution now reads.

Section 2, however. introduces
new material. Under the amend-
ment. Finance Board would “pre-
vent the transfer of runds by any
organization . . . from one line of
its budget to another." This would
prevent the expenditure of money
on items which are not mentioned
in the organization's budget.

Also, “Finance Board shall pre-
vent the transfer of funds from any
organization . . . to any other or-
ganization.” Two years ago, an
organization exceeded its income
somewhat, and traiisfered this ex-
cess to another organization. Should
the bill be passed, this procedure
would be prohibited.

Further Restrictions

“The Finance Board may at any
time impose further restrictions on
the finances of organizations receiv-
ing support from the Student Tax."
Should the amendment pass with
this clause, it would give the
Finance Board power to cut any
budget of any organization, increase
if, or withhold funds already ap-
propriated by the Student Associa-
tion. It would indirectly remove
the prerogative of the Student Body
to accept or reject items or whole
budgets of any organization.

However, the last clause of the
whole amendment reads: “decisions
of Finance Board may be appealed
to the Student Council and thence
to the Association as provided in
the By-Laws of the Constitution,
Section 4, which states that upon
the petition of 25 members of the
Association against a ruling of Stu—
dent Council, an appeal may be
made to the Association and the
latters's ruling accepted.

May Question Items

The new amendment further
grants Finance Board, through the
medium of the Student Auditor to
question any expenditure of any
organization receiving funds from
the Student Tax.

The second Student Council reso-
lution pertains to the relation of
Student Council and the Budget.
“Article V. section 2 of the Consti-
lution . . _ entitled Duties of Student
Council be amended by adding, ‘To
formulate and submit the Student
Association Budget in such a man-
ner as it sees fit, acting coopera—
tively with organizations receiving
funds from the Student Tax'”

This proposition was offered in an
attempt to curtail the great con-
fusion and "the passing of the
Budget without the full considera-
tion of its merits." Under the pres-
ent system, the tentative budget of
cacli organization is submitted to
Finance Board. The heads of each
organization then mch and reduee
