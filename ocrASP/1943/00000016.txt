Run. Eat. Pay Bill

 

 Super Sport; Spree ‘

ByMargo Byrne‘

v Girls of State—shake a leg—wig-
gle your ears (it helps your sinus
anyway)—-limber up those atro-
phied muscles in preparation for
that rowdy rumpus—Harps Riot
(plug) or just in expectation of
Spring, beautiful Spring. Where?
Why, at WAA’s annual Sports Spree
which is going to make the steel
beams of Page Hall Gym tremble
from 8 to 12 P. M. tonight.

At the door tags will be given
out to assign the girls to teams (this
to build up a healthy, happy spirit
of competition). Then they wander
about and amuse themselves as
fancy dictates. Badminton, basket-
ball, volleyball, dodgeball, ping-
pong and darts should cater to the
varied tastes of WAA’s guests.

For those whose talents run to
watching rather than playing, the
Saturday morning martyrs will offer
a fencing exhibition. Is it for noth-
ing that these brave souls have
routed their sleepy heads out of
bed on practically the break of day
every Saturday? If only to prove
that we appreciate them, let us give
them riotous support this evening.

Those girls who can really take
a beating may join in the folk danc-
ing. However, WAA assumes no
responsibility for injury.

To ﬁttingly climax an exciting
evening, a free lunch will be served.
Need more be said?

Dot Townsend and Mary Domann
are co-chairmen of the affair. Dot
urges all girls to come “for fun and
frolic.” She says, “Perhaps you’ll
discover that some sports you never
have tried are loads of fun. Be-
sides, who’d want to miss our Round
Robin Ping-Pong game?”

For the uninitiated this is played
by several girls on each side in-
stead of the usual one or two. Each
girl attempts a return and then
passes the paddle on to the next.
Novel, yes? Don't forget you are
invited to join in and enjoy your-
selves. Come one; come all.

Psi Gamma Leading
As Bowling Nears End

The WAA bowling tournament is
drawing to a close and a great deal
of interest is being shown in the
last games.

Psi Gamma, which has lost no
match as yet, holds a strong lead in
ﬁrst place. Cooper House is second
and Newman Hall is in the third

place. Tied for the fourth rank
are Kappa Delta and Gamma
Kappa. Moreland Hall and Phi

Delta are tied for the ﬁfth position.

Tuesday, Cooper House beat
Newman Hall in two games, and
Kappa Delta won two games from
Gamma Kappa Phi. These contests
will be finished this afternoon, in
order to get the final scores.

The team standings are ﬁgured
according to a point system based
on scores. Cooper, in second place,
is only three points ahead of More—
land and Phi Delta, (tied for last
place), so it is impossible to predict
which team will ﬁnally come out
second, due to this slight difference.

Credit goes to Helen Stuart, '45,
for her league game of 213~the
highest score turned in so far.

Lois Dann, captain of bowling,
says that so far, this has been a
very successful season and that she
hopes to see the completion of the
tourney next Friday.

Singer Leads In
Scoring Turmoil

The increased tempo of the intra-
mural schedule has caused changes
in the race for scoring leadership.
Hal Singer forged into the lead, dis-
placing Chillemi, who was idle this
week, as both individual and team
scoring record were smashed re-
lentlessly.

EEP set what is perhaps an all
time high in intramural competi-
tion with 61 points. Two nights
later Singer tallied 28 points against
KDR to smash another all time
record.

Other statistics show that SLS
has either played the cleanest ball
(or covered up the best) for they
have committed only 48 fouls in
eight games. Potter still holds the
offensive lead with 383 points in
ten games, while the Ramblers
claim the title of best defensive
team.

EEP Wins Trio,-

Potter Club practically assured
itself of the intramural basketball
championship Wednesday afternoon
when they defeated the second place
Rambler team. One win in their
next two starts will bring them the
trophy, now in College House’s pos-
session.

In gaining its third victory in as
many days, the State Street quintet
outpointed the Ramblers 32-23 in a
hard fought game. The losers kept
within striking distance during the
ﬁrst two periods, but brilliant teams
work and passing enabled the vic-
tors to draw away in the second
half after leading 16—12 at inter-
mission.

Monday night Potter Club avenged
an earlier defeat by overcoming
KB 38—26. The opponents were un-
able to show the power that they
did in the ﬁrst encounter, and EEP
held a comfortable lead throughout.
At halftime they were ahead 21—13.

Dr. John M. Snyles, President of
the College, paid tribute to Mr.
Bronson‘s scholarship and recalled
him as a man “greatly beloved" by
his students. Said Dr. Suyles, “He
was an authority on dictctics, and
was the author of a book. “Nutrition
and Food CIi.einist.r,i/', which is tised
extensively here and abroad.”

on birds and other aspects of natural
history.

He was also a fellow of the
American Association for the Ad-
vancement of Science.

Mr. Bronson also held member-
ship in the American Ornithological
Society. Audubon Society, Ameri-

Dewey Emphasizes Importance
Of Teacher-Training Institutions

Special Session

Begins June 26

Eighty-seven freshmen have to
date signiﬁed their intention of re-
turning to college for the 1943 sum-
mer session under the accelerated
conditions recently oerred to the
Class of 1946 by Dr. Milton G. Nel—
son, Dean of the College. The ses—
sion is also open to Sophomores. This
session, which begins June 26 and
ends on August 21 is entirely sepa—
rate from the regular summer ses-
sion which is this year scheduled
for July 5 to August 15.

One section of the accelerated
session will be made up of sub—
freshmen, members of the incoming
freshmen class. There will probably
be from 25 to 30.

Those freshmen who continue the
eight—week course for three succes-
sive summers eliminate one full
year from their college schedule.

The Sophomores who attend this
session for the next two summers
will reduce the time until gradua-
tion by one semester besides gaining
six additional credit hours.

The regular session is open to all
whose records will permit. It is
usually attended by those who wish
to lighten their regular college pro—
gram, and teachers who have only
ten—year provisional certificates.

 

Freshmen, Sophs to Sing
For Rivalry Points Friday

A week from today. during
assembly. the freshmen and
Sophomores will compete for the
two points awarded for Rivalry
sing.

The contest shall be judged on
the singing of a class song and
the nhnzi mater. This latter song
must be original in words and
music.

’l‘hrec faculty members will
act as judges. Although last
year's losers, this year the class
of '45 is ahead in rivalry. The
present Rivalry score is 171/: for
the Sophomores and 2 for the
freshmen.

Women Seek

Revision of Rules

Poll Voices Complaints
Against Residence Council

In an attempt to determine the
basis and extent of the complaints
against Residence Council, a poll
was taken of ﬁfty girls chosen at
random. A majority of the girls
interviewed were from the main
dormitory, but there were also
rczrcsentatives from other group
houscsﬂMoreland, Farrell. Newman
and sorority houses. The form was
distributed equally to each class.

Forty—three of the 50 girls felt
that some revision of Residence
Council organization should be
made. A majority of the girls
were in favor of proportional rep—
resentation.

In reply to the question “Do you
think that there should be a re-
vision of Residence Council rules?H
49 out of the 50 replied in the
allirmative. Of this number. 10
girls were in favor of the revision
merely for purposes of clarification.
Others mentioned specific rules
which they felt were unfair. The
twu rules to which they most ob-
jected wore the ones about calling
the president of Residence Council
for late permission and the rule
banning blanket permissions Men—
tioned less frequently were the
rules about having no late permis-
sions after a warning, and dismiss—
ing men from the houses an hour
before final curfew.

The girls stressed the fact that
it great deal of the difficulty seemed
to arise from a misnnderstunding
of the rules and their interpretation.
On one of the forms was the sug-
gestion that some method be found
whereby girls could air their cont—
plnints and ideas A report of the
poll was compiled and sent to
Residence Council.

Broadmindedness

Necessary Factor

Students Are Reminded
Of Part In Democracy

Taking time out in one of the
busiest weeks of the present legis-
lative session, Governor Thomas E.
Dewey issued a special statement to
the STATE COLLEGE News from his
office in the State Capitol. Accord-
ing to the Governor, State College
and all other institutions that are
training young people to become
teachers are playing a major role
in the furthering of democracy and
citizenship.

Governor Dewey believes that it
is the duty of student teachers to
acquire as much knowledge as
possible to ﬁt them for their role
as educators of future American
youth. He stresses the importance
of broadmindedness on the part of
future teachers, and the need to
realize the vast scope of their re-
sponsibility as members of their
chosen profession.

Following is Governor Dewey's
complete statement:

State College can be a vitally
important factor in the years that
lie ahead. The 850 members of the
student body will in the future be
teachers for thousands of young
American boys and girls.

Maintaining the high standards
of American education will take
extra effort and sacriﬁce in war-
time. Bnt the result will determine
the quality of our teachers of the
future.

It is the duty of all those who
have chosen teaching as their pro-
fession to avail themselves of every
possible means, not in conflict with
our war effort, to receive the widest
training on education. They must
keep an open mind on the prob-
lems of our rapidly-changing world,
always remembering that they will
be responsible in the years to come
for the education of a new genera-
tion of American citizens. They
must remember that American boys
are now dying on battleﬁelds
throughout the world to preserve
our free institutions. It is their
special privileges to instill in the
youth they will teach profound de-
votion to the principles of our free
republic.

Thomas E. Dewey.
Governor.

Not only does Governor Dewey’s
statement complement the opinions
of Dr. George D. Stoddard, Com-
missioner of Education in the State
of New York, but also those ex-
pressed bv mnny of the State Col-
lege faculty in the series Why
“condo in 'I‘mchiny'.’ now being
featured in the NEWS.
