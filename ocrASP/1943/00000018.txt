Sports
Chatter

By
Pete Marchefta

 

It seems as if Intramural CpunCil
missed the well known boat in re-
gards to a bowling league. .There
has been talk about starting a
league since last December, but ap-
parently it was Just talk and no
action. The starting date was post-
poned so many times that now its
too late in the season to begin.

Perhaps the uncertainty of a call
to active duty had created an
I-don’t-care attitude, but if the
league had been started when it
was first proposed, it would have
been completed by now. The ten-
sion due to uncertainty among the
reservists is great. Some of this
tension can be relieved by partiCi-
pating in organized sports.

Sports for Diversion .

Now that the ERC are gomg there
will probably be a tendency to drop
softball from the Intramural pro-
gram. We hope that this Wlll not
happen. However, if the number
of participants necessuates the
abandoning of a softball league,
Intramural Council or whoever is
left should attempt to have some
sort of organized sports.

Tennis, ping-pong and horsehoe
tournaments should be arranged so
that the men who are still here may
have a diversion from the uncer—
tainty of active duty in the serVices
and from the memories of their
school chums who have already left.

In winning the intramural bas—
ketball championship, Potter Club
showed that it was in a class by
itself as it handily defeated all but
one of its opponents. This lone de-
feat, at the hands of KB, was a
closely fought contest in which the
dorm fraternity played its best ball
of the season to earn the Win.
High Scoring Quintet

In the second round. however,
Potter moved at a fast clip, scoring
at will against most teams. In no
game in this half were they ever
pressed. '

With Evans and Kiley taking pop
shots, Gipp, hook shots, and Singer
dropping them in under the basket.
the State Street champs had a high
scoring combination. Their attack
was rounded out with a deft under
the basket passing attack which
played havoc with their opponents
zone.

Potter is now in possession of the
intramural football, basketball and
bowling trophies. The Ramblers
have the fourth (softball), having
won it last spring.

Sportsmanship

Although not very high in the
race, in our estimation SLS also
won a championship, that of having
the most sportsmanlike team, While
other players yelled and griped
whenever the referee called one
against them, (most of the times
the referee was in the right). the
SL5 boys took the adverse decisions
with a smile or shrug of the shoul—
ders and kept on playing.

Apparently they realized that
referees are not infallible,especially
student referees that we have here.
Others neglected this fact and ex-
pected every game to be called
perfectly. We do not wish to justify
the mistakes of the referees, for
they made many, but rather we
would like to see these mistakes
taken in a sportsinanlike iiuuiiicr
because after all, sportsmanship is
the real objective in every athletic
event.

Chump to Play Champ
ln Ping-Pong Tourney

florc Kuhn defeated qunnc Mul.
liii in a fast and skillful game to be—
come the "champH in the WAA
ping—pong tourney. She will play
the "chomp" to determine this
year's feminine ping-pong chain-
pioii of State College. _

'l'ho:.c who will battle it out for
the title of "chunip" are Jeanne
Mullin, Claire Schwartz, Sylvia
Brook and Nora Giavelli They are
all cxpcrt players, anyone of whom
is capable of giving the "champ" a

Potter Club Takes
Basketball Title

In Intramural Loop

During the past week Potter Club
became the indisputable champs of
the intramural basketball loop. .As
a result, they will gain possesswn
of the trophy now held by College
House and will retain it until an-
other season is completed. Other
positions are uncertain to date as
several games are yet to be played.

Last Thursday KB eliminated
Potter’s last possible opponent when
they handed the Ramblers their
third straight defeat. KB took an
early lead and were out ahead 14-7
at the intermission before gomg on
to win 31-23. The losers were un-
able to click offensively or defen-

sively. Scoring honors went to
Rabineau with 10 and Dingman
with 17.

Earlier in the evening KDR
scored an easy victory over SLS as
both teams played with four men.

Sometimes life seems very futile.
This is one of those times. I re—
member that when I was a fresh-
man, I thought it would be grand
to have a column of my own. Now
I’ve got one and what good does
it do me? Absolutely none.

Can I write what I please? No.
Can I hand down gems of wisdom
and wit and deal with history and
life at State in the manner of David
Slavin? Certainly I can’t. Me,
I can only relate the doings of WAA
and its athletic members. Can I
go blithly along the path of Herb
Leneker, making enemies and los-
ing friends with my verbal shafts?
I can only say that the winter sports
season is about to reach, has
reached, or has passed its height.
Can I sneak in a plug now and then
for Forum, my favorite organiza-
tion? I hate to think what Pete
and David would say if they found
anything unathletic in the column.
And the thing that really hurts is
that they would be justified.
Nothing New

It's not that I dislike writing
about sports; it's just that there's
pracically nothing new to say about
them. You write the story once
and then you say the same thing
about another team the next week
and then the next year you begin
all over again. More has been said
in the same vein by the Assistant
Woman's Sports Editor, Margo
Byrne.

"1 have become a cliche expert
as you have probably observed by
this time, if you are the observing
type (and if you aren't you should
be and had better mend your ways).

In saying that one team defeated
another in ten different places on
the same page and still incorporate
a measure of variety, I have re—
course to the series, beat, won, con-
quered, downed. cowed, was vic-
torious over, licked, overcame, out—
fought. triumphed over, etc, I re-
sort to horrible makeshifts such as
hoopstcrs. kegler, raqueteer, loop—
ster.

Repetition?

Occasionally when I’m typing my
assignment, I say to myself, “Didn't
I just finish this story? But no,
that was last week." With a reali-
zation of the utter futility of it all,
I consider that I might be, in fact
will be, doing the same story a year
from now. At this point I scream
loudly.

Since I have been in the sports
department, I have watched the
stifling of my originality, the inur-
dci' of my initiative. Occasionally
they come to the surface with dy-
ing cries, but relentlessly, I push
them down. With a firm hand I
smother their dying struggles. I'm
an intellectual dead end kid.

But enough of this meaningless
chatter, I must go back to the busi-
ness of this column. The WAA
winter sports scason is rolling along
and reached its height last Friday
with its super-doopcr tops Sports

Psi Gem Leads

Bowling Tourney

The WAA bowling tournament is
now in its last week, and it seems
that Psi Gamma is the uncontested
winner, having a lead of 11 points
over its nearest competitors, Cooper
House and Kappa Delta. Psi Gam
has 20 points, as compared to the 9
points earned by the other two
teams.

It is interesting to note that Psi
Gamma has lost only one game of
the many played.

State's Achievement in 100 Years

18‘14-1944n'l‘iine marches on and State College has marched with it,

the students did their own janitor

graduated the next August as the
class of 1845, attendance at the
school had risen to over 100.

The student at State Normal
School before the Civil War went
to a school where there were
"separate entrances for the sexesH
and where a "young man could be
expelled for peristing in breaking
the rule which prohibits gentlemen
ol the school from 'iilling upon

couples will celebrate the close of
the "Golden Era" when men were
men and not 1A.

The theme of the dance, in step
with the EBC's will be u Pic'ce

mosphere, the universal if not popu-
far one at the moment, creative
freshmen will hang gayly-colored
flags and banners. Programs will
also bear out the theme. Charming
canteen hostess will be Eunice
Baird, who will greet the guests as
they arrive.

Twri special features will high-
light the dance. Enticeinent num-
her one will be informal dress, a
custome inaugurated last year at
the request of condor—loving miles.
Second and spotlighted feature of
the evening will be the talent show,
copied from the famous Stage Door
Canteen, where actors and artists
stroll leisurely in at odd hours to
entertain the soldiers with their
sparkling wit and personality.

Committees for the dance are as
follows: Evelyn Putnam, house;
Mary Sanderson, decorations; Erma
Olmstead, refreshments; Audrey
Cushman, orchestra; Vera Willard,
programs; and Marie Soule, chap-
erones. Guests will be Dr. and Mrs.

And So Begins
The Alma Mater
Of State College

It’s a friendly place we have here
at State College and, like bread cast
upon the waters, at little friendliness
will be repaid thousand—fold. State,
like any other place in the World or
like the world itself, is just what
you make it. Come prepared to
make friends and you will find
them. Come with a chip on your
shoulder and someone will knock it
ofl. But the students at State will
do more than meet you half way.
Each and every person is given a
chance to find his niche, to dis-
cover the circle he is happiest in,
to do that task for which he feels
himself best suited. Sex, race, re-
ligion, or creed are no barriers.
Each is given his chance. and not
only do the fittest survive, but the
weakest are aided and made more
fit. State is what you make it.

Thou tlie iuoulder of our Fate

Thee we sing today

New theories of education place
the teacher in the classroom as a
guide and mentor rather than a
jailer. Thus is the classroom re-
organized and demoeratized. State
College shoWs it believes in these
theories by allowing the students
almost complete freedom in their
own governmental affairs and in the
running of their own organizations.
What better practice for Democracy
in the Classroom? And as for new
theories, wp practice them all, from
the new SricidI‘Studies program to
six-man football.

If it's fun you’re looking for,
we’ve got plenty of it here. You
can dance in the Commons, take
part in rivalry games, go out for
sports, eat, drink or be merry. And
fellows, there’s a ratio here, too. It
used to be 4 to I (that is, four
women to one man) though at the
present time circumstances beyond
our control have increased the
ratio. Dormitory life is fun, too.
You can always find someone in

your group house who thinks as
you do, and who is interested in the
same things you are. Then there
are "bull sessions” and then some
more “bull sessions.”

What's more, State College is a

thing to say about a college? It
shouldn't be. They actually teach
you things you can use after you
graduate, and also give you a li-
ccnse to leach these things,
