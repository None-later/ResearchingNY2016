STATE COLLEGE NEWS, FRIDAY MARCH 26, 1943

Down the Line

 

by Lyn Burrows

They’re always with us, the
faculty. More power to them who
have to cope with us, seekers of
wisdom. First I give you the “big
three.” President Sayles has ideas.
If the war hadn’t come,— but why
say that? Underneath he’s just a
kid who enjoys the informality of
a Hallowe’en noisemaker at a for-
mal dance. Dean Nelson is just a
boy, too. I’ll tell you a secret. If
you can keep your knee bones from
knocking together in that sanctum
of his, if you can keep your teeth
from clattering, if you can just
pretend he doesn't scare you~—-well,
he won’t! Dean Stokes adds the
feminine touch looking after our
morals and morale. Right out of
the math department, her analysis
isn’t half so cold as you might
think. (I wonder sometimes when
i talk to her if she remembers that
she flunked me in Trig.)

It’s hard to know where to begin
with those pedagogical geniuses,
Nobody should come first, and no—
body should come last, but because
I'm prejudiced I'll start with So-
cial Studies. Democracy is his
theme; democracy his way of life.
Grads call him “God,” and they al-
most mean it. To whom do I
refer? D. V. Smith, of course.
“Everytime I want him he’s down-
stairs peddling eggs,” says Dr.
Saers of Dr. Rienow. This legi-
timate farmer tears down your ideas
and makes you think up better
ones, just to make you a better citi-
zen. I don’t see how Dr. Stewart,
that “man about college," escaped
the South American belles 'eausc
he's “all out" for the good neighbor
policy. The faculty complained
about our lack of study last scm-
ester. Wcll, Dr. Baker found a
solution for his lazy sophomores.

Next comes English, the mother
tongue. You'd think after all these
years it would be all learned. The
department Is filthy with budding
talent. Take Dr. Hastings. every
inch (an there must be 78 inches)
a suave gentleman. It's hard to be-
lieve there was a day when cub rc-
portcrs dared to follow him and the
lady he made Mrs. Hastings into the
park for stories. You can grow up
in his novel courses if you'll give
yourself the chance. Dr. Jones is
all you will evcr want In the "typi—
cal college professor". Another
farmer, It doesn't seem to detract
from his cntlitisiasm for State stu—
dcllts‘rrthc fact that he has to get up
and feed the animals before he
makes his ninc o’clock class. Bill

 

 

Hardy, his other half, will be back
next year, we hope, to ﬁll the gap
he certainly left. No one has more
interesting classes than Dr. Me-
Ilwaine, the critic. His drawl and
his poetry are inseparable from the
man. Make way for the drama
(and no flat “a,” mind you). Miss
Futtcrer is directing. All who
aspire for the stage, take a lesson.
Curtain!

Mr. Mahar of the French Depart-
ment gives “A’s” to Seniors or re—
citers of the Rubi/tat. Dr. Smith,
more discriminate in her marking,
makes you wonder when she smiles
at your feeble explanation of why
your homework wasn’t done. Herr
Decker is an expert on femininity
and puns—at his age, too! Senor
Childcrs Inodernizes Cervantes like
Miss Dobbin modernizes Racine.
The gentle scholar of our ﬁrst Mys-
kania, Miss Wallace, makes Latin
and Greek a liberal education.

Dr. Beaver proves that one and
one do not equal two, in a most
convincing manner, and that it
makes no difference whether you
prefer blondes or brunettes. Mr.
Birclicnough injects his philosophy
into his math courses and watch
out—he hears as much as he wants
to! Dr. DoBcll can forget math for
photography, but his calling wasn’t
missed. He's good at both.

Dr. Clausen and Dr. Scotland mix
national defense with science. On
their field trips, one sees pine trees,
algae—and P—38’s. Dr. Lanford's
wife is as bright a light as he is.
Dr. Douglas is happy with her dog-
fish shark. She also drinks two
bottles of milk every noon.

The science of commerce is aptly
expounded by Mr. York in Com. 4
classes to students of Social Studies.
For Mr. Cooper we have another
love. He tries to balance our books.

The Fine Arts we appreciate
thanks to Miss IIutclIins, the de-
mure lady of the art department,
and Dr. Candlyn, master of music
Iu'pcggios.

Education is what I'c are here for.
Sapicntiit non slut scd (lIIchIdi
cuitsa. Illcks will ever be immor-
talized when State students sing the
Moving-Up Day song. C. (,‘. Smith
argues with no one better than with
himself. His discussions on life,
love, and religion, are Inspiring. Dr.
Morris doesn't argue—she knows all
the answers.

This Isn't till. I could have writ—
ten II book. I didn't want to leave
anyone out, but time and space
were limited. Here's II toast to the
Faculty!

by Herb Leneker

Both of our readers have approached us during the
last week, wondering who was to continue these
dainty little dispatches, and thus have the honor of
“making enemies and losing friends,” to quote II
sports columnist who couldn't think of anything else
to write about last week . . . Our two readers also
wanted to know if there was any truth as to that
rumor concerning our successor. . . .

This column has nominated no specific successor,
hoping—and it might appear in vain—that the powers-
that-be will utilize the beneﬁt of four years’ education
in making their choice. . . .

PAST, PRESENT a FUTURE

Tom Breen & some of the big city boys, have set
April 3rd as the tentative get-together date for State
College soldiers in that area . . . If interested, write
Tom at Concourse Plaza Hotel, NYC, or call Jcromc
7-4700, Room 510 . Tentative attendees include
lVlchregor, DuMont, DiGioa, Niblc, Powell. Saddle-
mire, Van Kucran, Bull and Dryden. .

Frank Ilardmeycr, No. l soldier of fortqu of Statc
College, is now working in a sugar beet refinery In
Germany . Was captured at Dicppc raid . . . Has
lavish praises for work of Red Cross . . . Made
Christmas cheery. etc. “One way and another
I am seeing a bit of Europe . . Jerry respects llIc
soldier's rights and privileges to the letter so don't
worry too much about Inc. . . ."

More about Ryan, reported missing last week . .
Was one of first American fliers to bomb Wilhclms-
haven Cited three times previous to award of
Air Medal for outstanding services Got this for
bombing St. Nazaii'c, most strongly defended spIII
In Europe . . . Crew refused to jump when controls
went to pieces . . . So local boy put out fires in cock-
pit and got her home someway . . . Remember Ryan
vividly as leader of local orchestra, wcarcr of dirty
saddleshoes & bright socks during practice lunch;
mg . . . Made sign that hangs in Milne math oflicc. . 4 .

Second Lt. Vibert 0. Fryer got jiltcd by lady luck
in the New Guinea area . . War dcp't sent con-
firmaiion (‘huck Franklyn, flying in the snow
area, is, as yet. still going steady with the chIIIc

Dorothy l'. Ihamlow got her WAAC commission
last Friday LII. Frank Evans, in North Africa

Sports
Chatter

By
Pete Marchetta

 

 

The war has absorbed the inter-
collegiate sport program of State
College. Cross-country, baseball,
and college tennis have dropped by
the wayside during the past year.
Although the Varsity basketball
schedule was completed in full this
season, all indications lead to the
temporary abandonment of this for
next year.

Such a trend in Varsity sports
is inevitable.

However, no major sport has been
allowed to disappear without mak-
ing some planning toward revival
after the war. Varsity sports have

prevail at State, you can be sure
that the Purple and Gold will again

Nor Is post-war planning simply

Completes Season

Intramural Athletics
Continue Despite War

by John Dooley

In spite of constantly growing
difficulties, Intramural Council has
successfully completed the basket-
ball program begun last fall. All
but three games were played this
year to complete one of the biggest
seasons so far in this sport.

Potter Club gained the champion-
ship spot with ease, winning 11 out
of 12. The Ramblers and KB
ended in a tie for second with 7
wins and 4 losses apiece. The
Finks, KDR, SLS, and the Dorm
filled out the other positions in that
order.

In the final games played a week
ago yesterday, Potter Club de-
feated the Dorm 33-22 and the
Finks overcame KDR in an over—
time game 25-23. The Champions
had little trouble in taking the
measure of the cellar-dwellers and
led Iii-10 at halftime. The second
encounter was much closer with
thc lcad changing hands several
times. The Finks held a 10—9 lead
at the intermission and scored a

Today in a world at war, healthy
bodies are more important than ever
before in our history. Now we need
the muscular co-ordination, agility
and strength that are gained through
participation in sports. It is a new
trend at many colleges, this encour-
agement of women's sports. Not so
at State; here the need for a full,
well-rounded sports program has
long been recognized. Sports of all
types are provided for the women
of the college.

All sports at school are under the
direction of the Women’s Athletic
Association. The one exception to
this rule is the compulsory gym
classes for the sophs and fresh.
Dean Nelson, himself, governs at-
tendance at these.

Every woman at State becomes a
member of WAA upon payment of
her student tax, but becomes a vot-
ing member only after she has
earned credit for one sport. WAA
is governed by a Council composed
of eight representatives from the
classes, two from each, and the
officers, a president, vice-president,
secretary, treasurer and song-
leader.

WAA not only directs campus
sports but owns a camp in the
Chatham Hills. This is called Camp
Johnson, in honor of Miss Johnson,
physical education teacher and
guardian angel of WAA. When the
Women of State grow weary of city
pavements and air, they may pack
their old clothes, board the train to
Chaiham and go native (in a nice
way, of course) in the woods.

There is a huge fireplace, peace
and quiet, at least there would be
peace and quiet if people didn’t
want to talk all night. Huge meals
long hikes, loafing in the sun, send
the women back to State, tanned
and full of energy, ready to take up
the intellectual grind again.

Any girl who enters college this
year, whether it be State or seine-
place else, will have to budget her
time with care. Today's freshmen
must be prepared to evaluate extr' -
class activities with a mind fully
awake to the problems and needs
of our present day world.

Therefore. each freshman should
allot a portion of his time to ath-
letics. What sport you choose is
Immaterial. Team sports will add
to your knowledge of people; indi-
vidual sports will give you poise
and ability to entertain yourself.
All will aid in the development of
II strong. healthy body and mind,
ready to Incct any call your country
may make on you.

 

“I shot an arrow Into the air"—
Arrlici'y Is one of the popular sports
around State.
