STATE COLLEGE NEWS, FRIDAY, MARCH'Qb, 1943

Dime Tour Shows Albany

As City of Progress,History

Many Interesting Points
Dot Map of Capital City

All aboard, folks! Only ﬁve min—
utes till tour time. See Albany,
the capital of New York State and
the home of State College. All
aboard!

On the left is the waterfront with
its sluggish barges and faster steam-
ers. Anyone here from Kingston?
There’s the night boat tied up at
the clock. The narrow, brick streets
that wind up to the heart of the
city have an ancient ﬂavor that
leads back to the memory of Wil—
liam Henry Hudson and the Dutch
settlers.

Shopping Center

And now, folks, the main shop-
ping center. There's the Strand
Theater where “Air Force” is play-
ing and here are Whitney’s and
Myers, two of the largest depart-
ment stores. No, the bus driver
can't stop this time, girls. The Ten
Eyck Hotel, famous for the music
from the Flag Room. Try it next
Saturday night.

Here is the steep hill leading up
to the Capitol. There it is, the
home of the State Legislature, with
its long approach of steps that lead
to the ornate, granite building which
covers three acres. Yes, the Mon—
day night sessions are open to the
public. One might even see the
Governor walking down the famous
million dollar staircase which is
lighted by an immense, glazed dome
and a cluster of lights. In back,
connected by an underground tun-
nel, the State Ofﬁce Building towers
133 stories into the air.

On the right the State Education
Building, with its graceful, Grecian
columns. Yes, that‘s where the
Regents papers are corrected. Visit
the State Library here, one of the
largest in the country. Visit the
museum on the fifth floor with its
dinosaurs, tree fossils, and lifelike
scenes depicting the daily toils of
the Indians of the Five Nations. No,
not real Indians, just wax. On the
street floor is Chancellors Hall, the
largest auditorium in the city,
where Vincent Slicean and Thorn—
ton Wilder have spoken and where
the Albany Symphony Orchestra
presents many of its concerts.

Art Institute

Up the street is the Albany Insti—
tute of History and Art, complete
with collections of painting, sculp-
ture and photography.

And now Washington Park. If it
were warmer there might be some
State students strolling chr the live
miles of elm and maple shaded
drives, playing tennis or boating in
the hike.

Today's tour must end on thc
outskirts of thc city. In the distance
tower the Ilcldcrbct‘g Mountains.
with 'l‘hatclicr Park, picnic grounds,
ski trails, and the Indian Ladder
l’atli. Want to go'.‘ You bring the
gas.

lone basket in the extra period to
gain the nod.

The completion of this sport may
see the activities of Intramural
Council curtailed somewhat for the
duration due to the decrease in
male students, but its past per—
formances cannot be dimmed by
what may come in the future. Be—
fore ex—Coach Goeway inaugurated
this new athletic program in 1935,
such sport events had been in the
hands of an intramural manager.
The increased demand for contests
among the various groups on cam-
pus soon made this arrangement too
burdensome.

Under the new plan Intramural
Council was formed. The first of-
ficers were elected at large, but,
under the present organization,
each team represented in the loop
appoints a member and from these
the ofllccrs are selected.

The Council receives funds each
year from the Student Association
through MAA and, with this money,
has provided an athletic program
well appreciated by those who do
not play varsity sports.

At present it sponsors loops in
football, basketball, bowling and
softball and givos awards to the
outstanding players of the year. In
the past it has held leagues in base-
ball, swimming, volleyball, tennis,
badminton aiid other sports when
the demand was great enough. It
has also sponsored inter-class
events.

Its importance cannot be stressed
too much for it provides a program
which reaches almost every male in
the school,

  

Dorms afoofe
Built by Alumni

“2-9612 please.” That’s the most
popular number in the telephone
directory of State College. It’ll get
you any one of 100 intelligent or
beautiful girls, maybe even both.
For it’s Pierce Hall, the classic
Colonial building, which is the cen-
ter of group life, an essential and
integral part of our life here at
State.

It's impossible to forget our
brother across the way—Sayles
Hall. These two buildings, sepa-
rated by a playing field and a Greek
theatre, form as attractive a quad-
rangle as can be found in any east-
ern college. $300,000 was required
to build each dorm and it was a
proud day, indeed, for Doctor
Sayles, “Dean Annie" (Former Dean
Anna E. Pierce) and the whole
college when the cornerstone for
the second building was laid and the
realization of a dream had been
made possible by the generous con-
tributions of a loyal alumni.

No doi'mite will ever forget the
"bull sessions" at midnight or the
tearing out of bed at nine for a 9:10
class, chatting with the housemother
or the "houscfatlier", hammering
one’s thumb while decorating the
Ingle Room for a big dance, sleep—
ing in Brubacher Lounge with a
good book—«these are memories that
will linger long after the "log of
zero" is forgotten.

Forum to Back

War Aid Dance
Friday, May 7

Entertainment Will Close

Russian Clothes Drive

The “grand finale" of the Old
Clothes Drive for Russian War Re-
lief will be a Forum-sponsored
dance Friday evening, May 7, in the
Commons from 9 P. M. until mid-
night.

Admission to the dance will be
in the form of old clothes. In addi-
tion to the regular dancing, there
will be games and square dancing.
Harold Goldstciii, '45, is in charge
of the entertainment which is to be
a mixture of vodka and "Kazatsky."
Refreshments will be served also.

Dr. Louis C. Jones, A sistant
Professor of English, is lending his
collection of Russian Cossack and
folk songs to blend in with the eve-
ning's atmosphere.

Drive a Success

The Old Clothes Drive has al—
ready brought vast results. In ad-
dition to a huge box in lower
Draper, three large boxes have
already been filled at different
group houses. Sunna Cooper, ’45,
Chairman, says, "The Drive so far
has been most successful. We’ve
had swell cooperation. If this
keeps up I won't be surprised if
we'll need a special ship to carry
all of State's 'old clothes' to the
USSR." Miss Cooper also requests
that “all group house presidents,
who have not already done so,
please start immediately their own
little individual campaign in their
own house."

Assisting on the committee are
Agnes Willett, '45, and Marion Beu-
tow, '46.

Radio Broadcast

Tuesday afternoon at 3:15 over
WABY, a “Letter to Russia" was
presented by a cast consisting en-
tirely of State College students.
Those who took part were Morris
Gerber, '43, and Trece Aney, Lois
Hampcl, Fred Shoemaker, James
McFeelcy, and Vera Willard, Jun-
iors. The program was broadcast
under the auspices of the City and
County War Council to promote the
Old Clothes Drive throughout this
arca.

Millie High School will collabo—
rate with State in this activity. The
high school campaign is under the
supervision of the Millie War Couri—
cil.

'Edna' Leaves Annex

Since vacation, a change has been
made in the Annex pcrsonncl. Mrs.
M. Philpoi has been made manager
to rcplacc Miss Edna Wasscrbacli
who now holds a position with the
State Dcpartmcni ofAudit and Con-

Pierce Is Not Dormant;

Girls Plan Fun Frolic

“Psst . . .hey, have you got a
date tonight? You haven’t? . . .
Uh, well, uh, neither have 1.”

That‘s how the whole thing
started. With all those empty
evenings—no Black Market on
men, you know—the Pierce Hall
gals just had to cook up some-
thing to do. ..

The whole conference was con _
ducted with the utmost secrecy,
but it has leaked out that the
dorm is planning a major cam—
paign to assist both themselves
and the war effort.

Just what form this contribu-
tion will assume is not certain
as yet, but it has been reporte
simuelaneausly that it will be a
circus, a revue, a varsity show,
and a minstrel. Take your pick,
for whatever goes. the college is
promised a full evening of fun
and frolic. IL is also rumored
that the admission fee will be
a mere war stamp. All the pro—
ceeds go to WAC.

Finance Board to Check
Organization Budgets

The new resolutions concerning
budget reform which were passed in
Assembly several weeks ago are
now being put into motion by
Finance Board. The college organ-
izations have been asked to hand
into the Board their tentative
budgets for the year. Those line
budgets, which cannot. contain any
abstract items such as "miscellane-
ous" will be reviewed by Finance
Board and Student Council before
being brought before Student Asso-
ciation iii Assembly, April 30,

As far as can be ascertained now
no raise in the student tax will be
necessary. This is possible because
certain items in the budget, such as
MAAdicrctoforc fairly large, will
be lowered because of current con—
ditions. The Board is figuring this
year's budget on the basis of 800
students niatriculating next year.

Finance Board at present consists
of six members, four of whom are
students and two faculty.

A.D. Schedules
Play for May 2|

"A new experience" is what Ad—
vanccd Drainatics students say will
be in store for State College on Fri-
day, May 21, in Page Hall Auditor-
ium, when the A.D. students will
present their annual spring produc-
tion, which is this year, Ladies in
Retirement by Percy and Denhani.

The cast, which as usual is made
up exclusively from Advanced
Draiiiatics classes, includes Rhona
Ryan, Trece Aney, Lois Hampel,
Mary Studebaker, Marjorie Brcuing,
and Harold Ashworth, Juniors.
Another character, which will ap-
pear in body but not in the flesh is
an Old Dutch Oven which will rival
its human counterparts for the
audiences' attention. Miss Agnes
E. Futterer, Assistant Professor of
English, is directing the play.
Ilorror Melodrama

The play is a horror melodrama
and its cast of mad or eccentric
characters finds the inspiration for
the mood of the play in its setting
of a late Victorian household of
three maiden ladies. The weird at-
mosphere will be a decided contrast
to more recent final productions.
Last year's, The Royal Family, offers
an unusual comparison to this play.
Ollicially called a "melodrama", the
plot involves three maiden sisters.
Two sisters are mad and the other
is a murdcrcss. Miss Ancy plays
the part of the murdcrcss.

The play has been a success on
Broadway, on the road and in the
movies. Flora Robson made the
stage play a hit wliilc Ida Lupiiio
played the Millie part in the movie
\ci'sion.

'l'lic casl will give a special dress
rehearsal performance for the Army
on 'l'liiirsday, May 20, previous to its
regular [it't'l'til'llltlllt'l‘ on Friday.
May 2i. At the rcgiilar production
admission will be by student tax
lickct.

tics but also social functions. Miss

Wilcox Suceeds
Despite Present
Man-Shortage

Repetitions of last night’s perform-
ance of The Gondoliers will be
offered tonight in Page Hall at 8:30
P. M. and at a television broadcast
over Station WRGB of Schenectady
at a date yet to be determined. As
evidenced by curtain calls, laughs,
and encores, the Operatic Society's
showing of last night was received
with enthusiasm.

With the shortage of available
male talent as a handicap, Dr. H.
Frederick T. Candlyn, Assistant Pro-
fessor of Music, and Student Direc-
tor Nancy Jane Wilcox, had an even
more difficult task than co—workers
of former years. By casting women
as gondoliers in the Gilbert and
Sullivan Operetta and by injecting
humorous references to the present
war conditions into the dialogue and
songs. Dr. Candlyn and Miss Wilcox
overcame their troubles.

McAllister Scores Again

Veteran Jean MacAllister, ‘43,
plays her third consecutive lead role
on the State College stage as Casilda,
a maiden who is in love with her
father's attendant but who had
been promised in infancy as the
wife of the son of the king of Bara-
taria. Her lover is portrayed by
Verne Marshall, '43, who was a
minor lead in the 1941 presenta-
tion of HMS Pinafore.

A newcomer to operetta and a
veteran of D and A productions is
James Mcheley, '44, who plays the
Duke of Plaza-Tore, father of Ca-
silda. Mary D. Alden, '45, as the
Duchess is in her first operatic lead.
State Grad Imported

Returning to State, David Kro-
man, ’39, did an outstanding per-
formance last night in his role of
Don Alhambra Del Bolero, the
Grand Inquisitor. Mr. Kroman, a
member of Advanced Dramatics and
Music Council while in college, is a
teacher in Schenectady.

Earle Snow and Roderick Fraser,
Juniors, as two gondoliers, add
complication to the story; one of
the two is presumed to be the
searched-for husband of Casilda,
and both are married. Their wives
are played by Agnes Young, '46, and
Joan Chapman, “'15.

The cast also includes Walter
Ui‘iﬁ)’\\’th'/. and Elizabeth Combs,
Seniors, Jane Southwick, '44, Bar—
bara Putnam and Janet Donahue,
Sophomores, and Waldemar Block,

»l.i.

Shirley Wow, '43, is in charge of
rt‘lh for the production. The first
act backdrop was designed by Sally
Richards and Gcorgia Hardsety,
Juniors. Julia Gorman, '~l3, was
second act designer.
