Sports
Chatter

By
Pete Marchella

 

The Men’s Athletic Association
Council has hung out the “ now
familiar sign around State, Sus-
pended for the Duration.

We are all sorry to see MAA off
campus, but it is like that bridge
we often see far bin advtaizce, but
which we decide est no 0 cross
until forced to do so. NIAA has
ﬁnally crossed its fatal bridge.

Although not in action until State
men return from their “world tour
trip,” MAA Council, under the wise
and foresighted leadership of its
president, Owen Board, has de-
vised a plan whereby some sports
activity will be maintained for the
male students next year.

Prepare For Future

More important is the asking of
an additional $100 on the budget.
(MAA’s other item on the budget is
$50 for intramural athletics.) This
$100 is to be stored away as a start
of a contingency fund. This is to be
increased by $100 annually so that
when the Athletic Council can re—
sume its activities they will have
some money to purchase equipment,
uniforms or whatever may be
needed for a resumption of an ath-
letic program.

A student-governed athletic pro-
gram was introduced into State in
1936. In the few short years that
followed, MAA gained the prom—
nence and prestige that it holds
today by doing its job exceptionally
well.

Its programs have proven attrac-
tive to participant and spectator
alike. It is not exaggerating to say
that MAA has given the students
more for their student tax than any
other organization with the possible
exception of the STATE COLLEGE
News.

Let’s Have Gym Classes

Even with the great exodus of
men that State has experienced
there are about ninety men still
registered in the school. (Yes, that’s
true girls.) However, there is such
a large number of previously as—
signed gym classes, that now only a
few men are in each class. Not
enough men are in any one gym
class to form two teams to play
basketball or any other sport.

We think that it’s too late in the
year to completely reorganize the
gym classes as was done last semes-
ter. However, it could be arranged
whereby tw0 or three of the present
gym classes can be combined into
one and regular attendance taken.
This will be somewhat better than
having less than a half—dozen men
doing calisthcnics in the commons
or in the gym.

Intramural Council

Plans Softball Race

Despite the scarcity of men around
State College now, MAA is making
plans for the continuance of this
year’s athletic program.

With softball season in the offing,
intramural Council is in hopes of
presenting a league. Although notlr-
ing is definite as yet, a four or live
team league is probable. Potter
Club, Pinks and the Dorm are cer—
tain to put teams on the field, while
KB may possibly be able to compete
and an independent team moire up
of the rest of the men will probably
be represented.

The chances are very slim that
there will be any more than thirty
men here next year. MAA Will be
discontinued for the duration and
only a small remnant of intramural
Council being lcft to carry on the
good work llll‘: organization has
done in the post.

Tentative llliillr. for iii-xi year will
result in the abolition of MAA
Some sort of Intramural Council,
however, will be set up wiilr about
fifty dollars in their budget to covor
their expenses

It is expected that those men who
are Interested in sports next year
will call a general meeting among
themselves and decide what organ-
izcd sports they can have.

STATE COLLEGE NEWS, FRIDAY, APRIL 16, 1934

Final l-M Statistics

Uphold Champion

Old Records Fall As
Singer Paces Aces

For the ﬁrst time since its pur-
chase by I—M Council, the basket-
ball trophy has left the possession
of College House, and will now re-
main at Potter Club for the dura-
tion.

The Ramblers and Kappa Beta
ﬁnished in a tie for runnerup honors
with 7 wins and 4 losses apiece, and
were followed by the Finks, KDR,
SLS, and the Dorm, in that order.

In winning 11 of 12 games, EEP
averaged 38.4 points per game, their
offensive being stopped only once by
the KB's tight zone. Records of all
sports were smashed, as their excel-
lent pass work set the stage for high
individual and team scores.

Kappa Beta, with virtually the
same team they had last year,
played inconsistent ball, incurring
several unexpected defeats which
squelched their bid for first place
honors. The Ramblers, who scored
fewer points than their opponents,
nevertheless managed to win a ma-
jority of their games.

The Finks, after a slow start,
began to play first division ball and
passed the squads from KDR and
SLS, whose greatest weaknesses lay
in their inability to replace drafted
men. Despite several good players,
the Dorm was handicapped by in-
experience, which means something
even in an intramural league.

The race for scoring leadership
was also completed as Hal Singer's
100 points barely topped Chellemi’s
99. Singer’s one-point lead was
greatly abetted by his participation
in two more games, one a brilliant
28-point performance, but on the
other hand his average per shot
was undoubtedly higher.

Hippick, who left the I—M League
after three games to play jayvee
ball, attained an average of 13 points
per game for the highest in this
department. The honors, however,
go to Chelleini, who compiled an
average of 9.9 points per game for
10 games.

It Could
Be

WU I'Z

 

Gone are the days when the
women of State could get their ath-
letic exercises and enjoyment in
vicarious fashion by watching men's
sports. Now with all the men. in the
service or practically all of them,
the women will have to provide ath-
letic excitement at State.

Why don’t we have a feminine
tennis team formed to compete with
other colleges? Nora Giavelli and
Flo Garfall make a capable nucleus
about which such a team could be
built. Perhaps they could play St.
Rese, Skidmorc, Sage, or even Siena
and Union if they are still function~
ing next year.

Intercollegiate Competition

In the past years WAA has made
many attempts to have athletic con-
tests with women's colleges in the
vicinity. Such attempts have not
been very successful, yet since the
athletic program of State will un-
dergo radical changes next year.
such a program might well be tried
again. Although St. Rose does not
offer a very extensive sports pro—
gram, both Sage and Skidmorc
should be able to produce teams
capable of offering stiff competition
for State players.

Soon the budget will be presented.
to the student body. It is to be
hoped that when WAA's budget is
considered that the students will
remember that next year WAA will
have a greater responsibility than
ever before.

Trophy Io I)B(“s

Today in assembly the new bas-
ketball trophy will be awarded to
DBC by Win Jones. DBC is com-
posed of lilcnibcl‘s of Kappa Delta,
Beta Zeta and Chi Sigma Theta so
the clapping should be long and
loud at the presentation of the
trophy.

Members of WAA were given a
pleasant surprise just before Spring
vacation when the WAA Flashes
was issued. This is a mimcographed
sheet intended to tell what WAA is
doing in each season. Written in
informal style, it is very readable.
Orchids to Win Jones who did all
the work.

One of the features of the WAA
Flushes was the selection of an All-
Stars Team. DBC and Newman
Hall dominated this team. The
three members chosen from DBC
are Mary Domann, Chi Sig; Leda
LaSallc, Beta Zeta; Mary Sanderson,
Kappa Delta. Newman Hall is
represented by Flo Gnrfall and Nora
Giavelli, Georgette Dunn, the re—
maining All—Star. plays for Bela
Zeta.

WAA Begins"
Its Spring Season

As the WAA Spring season be—
gins, softball, its main sport, comes
into its own. Practice has already
started. Last Wednesday at 3:30
about twenty girls came to the Page
Hall gym for the ﬁrst practice.
Saftball will continue to be held in
the gym until weather permits mov-
ing outdoors.

This year there will be an inova—
tion——a girl's softball league. Houses
will form teams and games will be
played all in the same manner as
the basketball league. For those
who are not on particular teams
there will be a game on the Dorm
ﬁeld simultaneously with the league
games.

The captains, Dot Townsend and
Mary Now, promise that there will
be an opportunity for all girls to
participate and urge that teams be
formed as rapidly as possible. There
will be another practice today at
3:30 P. M. and every Monday,
Wednesday and Friday from now on.

It is predicted that hiking, a new
sport this year will be popular,
healthful and a lot of fun. The
program includes a long hike Satur—
days with the girls bringing along
their lunch. If all those interested
will sign up immediately on the
WAA bulletin board a captain will
be appointed and the sport begun.

  

Five Teams Place

MenOnAll-Slars

Following the usual procedure
upon completion of an intramural
sport, representatives of the seven
intramural teams submitted their
choices for an All-Star team.

The well balanced outﬁt from
EEP dominated the squads as they
placed two men on the ﬁrst ﬁve and
three on the second. Kappa Beta
placed one on each, the Finks and
Dorm were each represented on the
first team, and a Rambler garnered
the remaining second team position.

Voting was close among these ten,
although only two men, Flax and
Singer received unanimous ballots.
The electors cast their votes with
consideration for offensive value,
defensive value and team value.

The teams are as follows:

First Team
F Olivet, Finks
F Chillemi, Dorm
C Singer, EEI’
G Flax, KB
G Evans. ICEI’
Second Team
F Gipp, EEI’
F Kiley, EEI’
C Hammond. EEI’
G Dingman, Ramblers
G Kensky, KB

Honarable mention goes to Hal

Ashworth and Lou Rabineau.

ALBANY,

IINo Ersatz In Milne,"—D. V.

EDITOR'S NOTE

Monday’s “New York Times" published (1. news story stating that the
committee on American History had telegraphed Governor Thomas E.
Dewey requesting that an investigation be made of the teaching of history
in the State—sponsored Milne school at Albany. Hugh R. Fraser, chairman
of the committee, contended that at the Milne school “ersatz” history had
been substituted for the story of the United States. Governor Dewey has
ordered an investigation of the situation and detailed reports from the
Social Studies department of the Milne school. Dr. John M. Siiyles, Presi-
dent of the college, has publicly refuted the statements made by Mr. Fraser

in the “Knickerbocker News”.

Below are excepts from the “New York Times" which contain charges
brought by the committee and excerpts from (L lecture defending the Milne
program made by Dr. Donnal V. Smith, Professor of Social Studies, and

originator of the new program.
FRASER

“Milne at Albany, is the State-
sponsored six-year laboratory school
of New York State College for
Teachers. Here instruction is given
by the senior students of the col-
lege. They work under the sharp
eye of faculty members especially
trained in the latest methods of
Teachers College, Columbia.

"The student at Milne comes into
first contact with the history of the
nation in the eighth grade, where he
learns about the National Coin—
mui'iity'. This is a social studies
word for the United States. Here
his instruction is divided into seven
parts. But only one of these seven
parts concerns the development of
our political democracy!

Division of Program

"Grade nine is devoted to "l‘lie
World Couiniuirily.' grade ten to
‘Man's Advancing Cullui'c,’ the
twelfth gradc lo 'Sociirl Relation—
ships.' That leaves the eleventh
grade for the history of this coun-
try. Yet only one-third of this
course level is devoted to what may
be properly called American his—
tory. In fact, strictly speaking, the
amount deVoted to the events and
the personalties and philosophies of
the men constituting our history
may be said to fluctuate between
one—fifth and one-third.”

'l‘he telegram sent to Governor
Dewey reads as follows:

“The effect of certain sir—called
“laboratory schools" on the curricula
of the high schools of the nation is
far—reaching.

Milne—No. 1 Guinea Pig

“One such school, largely under
the domination of the Teachers Col—
lege, Columbia, and lhe National
Council for the Social studies, is the
State-sponsored Milne School of Al—
bany. ll is the No. l guinea pig of
llre education extremists. Here an
crsatz history has been substituted
for the drama that is America. In
fact, in [he one grade that renders
even ll})->It‘l'\'lt'(' lo the subject, the
school announces officially that ‘the
emphasis is placed on contemporary
aspects of American ci\'ililulion.'

It is l't"r].l't'fl\‘(‘ly suggested that
you dirch an investigation on the
curriculum content of this school
to the cud fill” in the Eastern and
New l‘luglzmd States the increasing
li'ciul iouzrrd llri- neglect of the
history of IliI‘ United Slirlcs bc
curbed."

SMITII

“It isn't necessary for us to use
German words to discuss any course
given in Milne. Mr. Fraser's tele-
gram lo the Governor, like all the
rest of his ridiculous charge, is
entirely false. State and Milne
have only one person of the entire
staff who ever attended Teacher's
College. She was there one year.
How then can we be influenced
by Teachers College? Our fac—
ulty are graduates of institutions
that did not go in for fads: Chicago,
Wisconsin, lowa, Johns Hopkins,
Columbia are not schools noted for
extremist philosophy.

Matcrial Well Covered

"In Millie two years of American
History are taught, in Grade 8 and
in Grade 11. In Grade 11, Wirth's
'l.)cvelopnienl of America', which
is a chronological presentation of
events of American History, is used.
III the Social Studies Department
of the college, 21 courses of Amer—
can History are offered.

"In each of these courses, every
attempt is made to make the his-
tory of the United States real and
vital and a part of the lives of the
pupils. If nothing of value is
taught, then we might expect to
find many pupils failing the Regents
examination.

I’roof in Facts

"it is a matter of record that we
have only a small percentage of
failure. in the past five years, 332
out of 344 passed the History C
examination. As for other socia'
subjects which Mr. Fraser says we
teach, such as the World Commun—
ity, we confess that we do. So
does every other secondary school
lll New York and most other states
as well.

"Mr. Fraser employs the prop—
aganda technique of newspaper
men. While we would be the fast

orrc should point out to Mr" l"ru:—.er

You must have heard of Percy
Granger. That's right, he did
write Country Gardens. But
more important than his compos-

Versatile, that's the word for
Mr. Granger. He's quite an out-
door man and several times has
astounded everyone by putting
his dress clothes in a bag and
hiking to his recital. His recitals

A D Play Uses
Eerie Selling
For ’New Effectl

By Dorothy Meyers

There's a different atmosphere
around school these days. We de—
cided to find out what it was and
so, following our noses We wound
up in Page Hall. where the AD.
play was in progress of rehearsal.

The “different” turned out to be
the eerie atmosphere which was
emanating straight out of the late
Victorian setting of the play.
Right in the middle of this setting
of heavy furniture and dark drapes,
Aney, Breunig, Studebaker, Ham-
pcl, Ryan and Ashworth were prac-
ticing. And it was then that we
really noticed something different.

For there on the stage, Brcunig
and Studebaker were going through
the most convincing "mad" scene.
Can you imagine Bruenig and
Studebaker as "mad"? Neither
could be, but there they were.

As the rehearsal went on we got
more and more surprised. There
was Ryan who is usually so active
lying there murdered, and what's
worse, there's ’l‘rece who had just
done the “dastardly deed" standing
over her.

But here was the pay—off. As the
play progresses it becomes evident
that Ashworth is a CAD, one of
those miserable creatures who in-
habit all Victorian plays. And there
was llampel making the most per—
