Sperts
Chatter

By
Pete Marchetta

 

One full month remains _in the
men’s athletic program. This pro-
vides plenty of time for the comple-
tion of a softball schedule. Now
that a four-team league is deﬁnitely
decided upon, there should be no
time lost in organizing a schedule
and setting the opening dates.

Time is a very important element
and the sooner the softball league
can start, the better. Inclement
weather can play havoc with almost
any outdoor sport schedule. This
is especially true with softball.

Third Round Possible '

Then too, only six games will
comprise one round. By starting
the league at an early date it Will
be possible to play at least two
rounds with a good possibility of
a third, how about beginning before
next week is on?

Every year the people in charge
of softball find it very difﬁcult to
get men to volunteer for umpiring.
This year the need for umpiresas
greater than ever. It is essential
that competent persons are aSSigned
to govern games. However, this
cannot be done unless enough peo-
ple sign up and can be instructed
in the ground rules. In order to
facilitate matters and elminate pos-
sible arguments, we will publish
elsewhere on this page the ground
rules that will govern the softball
league this year.

Starting Time a Problem

The starting time for games this
year will present a problem to Gil—_
len and Reed, who are in charge of
the softball league. Allowance must
be made for those players who have
labs in the afternoons, and there
are many. The absence of one or
two players will probably mean the
postponement of the contest as
every squad will have few replace-
ments, if any.

We would like to suggest that
the starting time be set for 5:00-5:30
P.M. This will allow sufficient
time for those having late labs and
also the games will be ﬁnished at a
time which will not be too late for
supper.

Women's Swimming

Nears End of Coursel

With the end of the swimming
season in view, Pat Latimer. cap—
tain, has given a report on the re-
sults of its activities. The season
was very successful, both in athletic
and practical accomplishments.

Twenty girls have received credit
in the sport. Life—saving tests will
be held after Easter, and those who
succeed in passing will be qualified
as instructors. Tlii. will ln‘UVL' a
great asset to the fled Cross pro—
gram of advancing swimming safety
through instruction.

Sonic girls may be interested
enough in the sport to continue
after the season is completed. For
these pcoplc, WAA will sponsor
swimming parties to the Six Mile
Waterworks, a lake at llli' end of
Western Avenue. as soon as the
wcailicr iiiipi'ovcs. Expci'lcncc in
fresh water will be a wclcoinc relief
after swimming in a highlv chlori-
natcd pool all winter

STATE COLLEGE NEWS, THRUSDAY, APRIL 22, 1934

SoftballiSchedule
Awaits Approval
Of Sayles and Sun

DirectOrs Decide Rules

As Players Workout

At present the only thing pre-
venting the immediate advent of the
Intramural softball season is that
unpredictable factor called weather.
However, directors Ben Reed and
Dan Gillen are prepared to begin
the schedule as soon as the condi-
tion of the diamon in front of Page
Hall meets the approval of Presi-
dent Sayles.

The four teams are ready and
after-effects of last week end's first
eager to “play ball,” although the
work out left many stiff and cau-
tious. With the trophy at stake,
the competition among the four
teams representing EEP, the Pinks.
the Dorm, and an independent team
composed of the remaining males at
State should be keen. Last year's
champions, the Ramblers, have com-
bined with EEP, the runner-up
squad.

From all appearances the league
is going to be a batter’s paradise
this year unless some new pitchers
are discovered. Even the disappear—
ance of the lively ball necessitated
by shortaage of materials will not
be enough to allow the present crop
of hurlers to check the hitters.

The regular softball rules shall
apply to all games played in the
Softball League with the addition
of the following ground rules.

1. A batter may not riui on a drop-
ped third strike.

2. On an overthrow which strikes a
spectator or any otiicr obstruction
the base riuiiii-rs autoniuticnlly ad—
vance one base.

3. A runner on third base can not
score on a pass.d ball or wild pitch.

4. A ball falling'through the trees
in right and center fields it caught
will be registered as a put out.
(This rule applies to right and ceri-
ter fields only.)

5. Bali hit to right of designated
tree marker in right ticid and into
Western Avenue will automatically
be a double.

It Could
Be

WUI’Z

 

 

Walking down the hall our eye
play of paper on the WAA bulletin
board. There in longhand covering
eight sheets of paper was the WAA
constitution. A change has been
made. The WAA Flashes is to be—
come a permanent part of the pro-
gram, a paper to be published or
rather mimeographed once a month.
WAA will have plenty of publicity
next year, what with its own paper
and probably the entire sports page
of the News.

A Plea for Beauty

Comes spring; comes the finish
of the tennis tourney. Money is
scarce. btit beauty is important.
And just what are all these words
leading too? In a few plain and
simple ones—-—we need a new trophy
for the winner of the tennis tourna—
ment. There is little of grace or
beauty in the present one, which is
the slightly battered figure of an
athletic girl clad in bloomers. Surely
the budget could stretch that far.
To the victor belongs the spoils,
but in this case the spoils, except
for the honor, are hardly worth
winning. Let’s not let the episode
of the Stanley Cup be repeated here
at State.
Paging Silver Queen

Yesterday someone asked us
about the horses out at the Ranch.
"i'd like to go riding, but I’m a
trifle afraid, since I've never been.
Are they very spirited?” That in-
noccnt query brought Silver Queen
to mind. Dear, staid Silver Queen,
never willing to move faster than a
slow walk, snatching at every ex-
cuse to pause and sleep, she’s a
horse that we would recommend for
any novice. Of course there are
other horses for those who like to
ride not just sit on a horse. There
are Captain and Ginger and King.
But Silver Queen with her placid
calm is the horse with the colorless
personality at The Ranch.

State to Hear

Moving-Up Day

Gi'eig heard him and called him
“a genius such as we Scandinavians
must love;” the Titties Union. re—
viewer attended a recital and lauded
his "unusual dynamic effects;" on
May 8 a State College audience will
have an opportunity to add their
impressions of the Pianist-Coni-
poser-Condtictor—Percy Graingcr.

Music Council will present Grain-
ger with the College Chorus in a
40-minute program which will com-
prise the afternoon entertainment of
Moving-Up Day. The recital will
be held in Page Hall Auditorium at
4 P. M.

For more than half a century,
Percy Graingcr has been devoted to
the piano, having made his first
public appearance at the age of ten.

ustraliaii-born, he was cdticated
in Melbourne and in Germany,

The keen - c y cd. fluffy-haired
pianist may well be called the
“patriot-musician,' for he claims
his passion is "English-speaking
music" which includes works by
composers of the United States,
Britain, and his own Australia.
Ameiican audiences first heard
Graingcr in 1915. Three years liit\i',
while he was serving as a hands—
man in the United States Army, the
musician became an American citi-
zcn.

Tours of England, Australia,
South Africa, iiolland, Scandinavia,
and other European countries have
introduced aiidicnics to his talent.
Graingcr's recitals 'o'c Well sprink—
led with work o the modems-u
Debussy. Ravel. I; )cliiis, Albeniz,
C-iipciiiri. lJL'it, tii‘ii UUIUH.

"Molly on the Shore." "Shep—
licrd's Hey," and "Irish Time from
County Hey." as well as the more
famous "Country Gardens" are
among Gi'aingcr's compositions.

Strident of folksoi'ig, Graingcr has
collected melodies from lands as
distant as the South Seas.

Admission to the recital is by
student tax tickets. General admis-
sion tickets may be purchased at the
Co-np or at McClure and Dorwaldt's
for 85 cents.

Diploma, Certificate Deadline

in order to graduate. Seniors
must ordcr and pay for their diplo—
mas by 3230 today. The deadline

day. Orders must be placed at Ilic
lnblc in lower hall of Draper.

Diplomas cost $2.50; teaching ccr—
iiflcatcs. $3.00.

Seniors caps and gowns for Mov—
ing—Up Day will be distributed at
the Co-op ucxt wcck.

Forum Wants Old Clothes

Admission ain’t gonna cost you
nuthin'! No sir, all you have to
do to get into Forum‘s Party
Friday, May 7, is to drag along
some old clothes.

Dames, games, dancing, enter-
tainment, and concessions will
highlight the evening’s fun. In
addition to this, arrangements are
being made to procure seine extra
men.

Harold Goldstein, '45, will be
the Master of Ceremonies. Osnif
Serabian, '44, is in charge of
games. and Mary Betty Stcngel,
‘44, is taking care of the publicity.

A food ticket may be purchased
for 15 cents, which will entitle
the holder to sandwiches. coffee,
and doughnuts.

All proceeds will go to Russian
War Relief.

3:30 p. in. will clear up all last—
inintitc details concerning this
party. There will also be a
"hashing" of matters of current
interest.

Student Tax Reduction
Will Also be Considered

The 1943-44 Budget will be pre-
sented in Assembly this morning
for consideration by Student Asso-
ciation. This Budget has already
been carefully considered by Fin—
ance Board before being turned
over to Student Association. The
total budget is $10,824.30 or a de—
crease of $2,028.45 over last year.
Such a decrease will insure a lower
:tudent tax for next year.

Large MAA Reduction]

The lower figure is due to may
factors. the chief of which is the
VIIUI‘al discontinuation of MAA.
The comparison of the MAA appro-
priation for last year of $2,238.75
and that of this year, $150, shows
li‘ow the decrease was possible.
'ihis lowering in male enrollment
Will be inatciied. it is hoped, by a
subsequent rise in the enrollment,
of'women thus accounting for the
raise in the WAA budget. This,
however, was not enough to upset
the difference in the two budgets.
The $150 allowed to MAA is thought
to be sullicicnt to provide a sports
program for the men who will be
here and also a reserve, until the
war is over.

Other organizations who lowered
tiicir requests were Mtisic Council,

Debate Council. Pedagogue, and
Pl‘EB. The STATE Corrscr: News.

D. & A. Council, WAA, Student
Council, Myskania and Fresh Hand-
book raised their appropriation.
'l‘welve or Thirteen Dollar Tax

This decrease makes possible a
$12 or $13 student tax for next year;
which is to be determined by Stu-
dcnt Association. A representative
of Finance Board, in addition to
presenting the Budget, will suggest
two plans for a lower tax The first
would simply authorize a $13 tax
which Would fullv cover the Budget
as it now stands. The second
would suggest a $12 tax. It would
br- covered by a surplus which Fi-
nance Board expects to realize
from this year's Budget. A motion
from the floor by a Student Asso—
ciation member will be necessary
for putting into motion either of
these plans.

Many of the appropriations from
the 1042-43 Budget are being turn-
cd hack to the Board. If a $12
sltltlt‘ill tax is authorized by Stu-
(li‘ill Association, it will necessitate
using $624 of the surplus. This is
based on 850 students and will not
ilt‘lllL‘lL‘ the surplus drastically.

'l‘hc intirmary fund and the
l‘i-(luoognc appropriations are based
on the assumption that 850 students
will bc :iiti-nding State College next

This is the last budch to be pre-
