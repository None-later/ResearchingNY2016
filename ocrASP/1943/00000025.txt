Of Men and Money

At this point, it looks as if the ttirritilt and the
shouting were going to die turexprcs‘scd. 'l'hc
.-\ttivities Budget for the college year 1913-1le
is not otre that should provoke much contro-
versy. There will be the usual fault-finders, bttt
with a 513 tax alr*ady assured, without arty
bttdgct alteration whatsoever, their protests will
probably be only a small part of the budget
meeting.

 

A very few organizations raised their budgets:
they are for the irrost part attivitics whose
expenses have been nctcssarily raised by present
economic conditions. in the case of \I'.r\.-\, the
increase iir feminine enrollment more than
justifies the money asked. 111 the main, how-
ever, most activities are either askitrg for the
same appropriation or are lowering their items
considerably. A’I.\:\'s budget explains itself. .\
drop from $2,238.75 to $1.30 seems extreme; it
is also inevitable. Moreover, the plight of .\l.\.\
greatly sitrrplifies this morning's protedttrc.

With the present $10,821.30 budget, students
will be assessed .513 next year, and a small
surplus will be left. Willi very little trouble,
the budget (ould be cut to allow a 512 tax.
What the final assessment will be, will be deter-
mined by the interest, or latk of it, of the s111<
dent body. Budgetary discussions iii the past
have been spirited. They have been exciting.
perhaps the (onfusiott did not athlete the proper
result; we kirow it did trot iii many tascs. But
its lil’e‘sHHC was far more valuable than the
passitily that may very easin llatttrt itself itr
today's .\~sernbly.

I’ppertlassrnen irt today. .\ssctnbly will miss
the heat and furor of past budget meetings.
it may be that the budget will irate been passed
when the noon-hour bell tings, an almost tttibe-
lie\tible orttttrente. It may be that students,
already far stttik iii the sands of apathy, will
retnaiu pltuidh in tlteir state of lethargy
throughout. limes ha\e (hanged.

War Fronts by Ryan

And in this week of the war the
head-lines frotn North Africa
gripped the minds of Americans.
The Axis armies reeled utrdcr the
cotnbiircd attacks of the Allied
Armies. Air ominous notc followed
the communiqucs, as correspond—
ents warned that every yard gained
was being paid for heavily iir enor-
mous casualties. The British Eighth
Artrry, once the butt of ridicule
frotri the world at large, cairre into
its own as comparable to some of
the Russian armies. It is now one
of the toughest, most fluid, and ex—
pcricirccd armies iii military history.
The almost fanatical General Mont-
gonrcry had done his job well.
There is still much to do, of course.
The Germans are by no means dc-
fcirtcd, and are forming Ircw litres
constantly. But that they will have
to withdraw soon, or perish wtllr
their backs to the grey Mediter—
ranean, is ti foregone eoiicltision.

Arid the Aleutians, forgotten for
a while, entire into the llt'Wn with
a vengeance. There were whispers
of a possible .fap offensive there,
while Army bombers relentlessly
continued pounding at the air bases
iii Kiskti. For the first time since
Novctrrbcr, it was irretrtiouod iii the
Navy dispatches that Canadian fliers
had joined in 111 heavy raids. That
raised the mouths total to the slug-
geriiig sum of 142

There was some diplomatic coir-
traicinps to watch for those who
realize the importance of such

doings, even though battles steal the
headlines. Certainly, Nazi propa—
gatidists do. They have almost suc-
ceeded irr alienating the Polish and
Russian governtrretrts itr these criti-
cal months by demanding an inves—
tigation of the fitrditrg of Polish
bodies that once were strewn over
the fields about Warsaw; it seemed
more itrtportrrnt than the starved
faces, working its slaves iii German-
coiitrollcd industries; it seemed
more important than the horrible
fate of Jewish Poles, fit all, the
Nazi propaganda machine was still
functioning cflicietttly in its- most
itrrportatri task stirring tip hatreds
arid rrristitulerstatrdtugs among ilrc
United Nations. But at latest re—
ports it secured the Polish extle gov~
crnrrierrt was coming to its .scItst-s
and droppitrg the Investigation

The old story of the grim lflls'
.siori battles continued with lllllt'
change, and with the some error-
motis loss of life on both sides

“To the men of Sayles Hall:

Greetings,

I was sure glad to receive that long letter from
Sayles Hall. That letter was better for my morale
than a dozen movie stars—well, a half dozen anyhow.

Before I started this letter I had intentions of mak-
ing it serious, but today's movie—an Abbott and
Costello picture——sorta knocked me out of the mood.
I was going 10 tell you what I personally am going
to fight for. I was going to tell you I was fighting
for all my college memories. State College ones
mainly. The open houses at Sayles and Pierce, the
wonder of a first dance, the midnight snacks at the
20th Century Diner, the damn funny ballads and
ditties we san during blackouts, racing for the marl
after the 3:25 class, and, oh, so many other swell
things. I'm not ﬁghting to free the seas, to break
tip world cartels, to bring international security
No! I'm fighting to step on a girl's toes again, listen
to a juke box record of Bing Crosby, over a coke.
I'm fighting for my nronr and dad and sister and
brother.

Please write again. I nearly cried in my cake over
that last letter.

Sincerely yours,
Irv.

STATE COLLEGE NEWS, FRIDAY, APRIL 30, 1943

Dr. Walker to Resign Position
After 35 Years As State Prof

 

Venez ici . Come here, cherie,
And sit down by me so,
And I will tell you storee,
Of the old tent long ago
When everything is louelee
And all the birdies sing
And me, I’m young and strong like
moose,
Not afraid of netting. .

Then there followed a gay poem
in French-Canadian dialect by a
narrator with pepper—colored bushy
eyebrows. His eyes laughed and
his hands made gestures as Dr.
Walker talked. He finished the
poem, and then told us about his
old "old icms long ago."

Dr. Adam Walker will leave State
College at the end of this semester.

The French-Canadian poem was
a belated encore to Dr. Walker's
similar perforirrancc in the faculty
skit for the State Fair, at which
time he also played the violin iii
the orchestra. Dr. Walker explained
both of these talents in an litter—
view Wednesday. He made it hobby
of collecting the poetry frotri
French-Canadians who worked on
his father's farm itr northern New
York and who lived in the vicinity.
His orchestra showing he explained
modestly, “I'm not a lliUs‘iCllill; I
just fiddle a little."

Dr. Walker came to State in 1908
to teach economics and sociology.
He took out ti pencil, subtracted,
and announced, “Thirty-five years
——awful long time." Those years be
summed up as “most interesting to
meet classes each day and to enjoy
the fcilowslrip and, 1 think, the coir-
fidenec and certainly the stimula-
lion of young l.l_'.l|)lt‘ iii college.‘

Dr. Walker's eyes laughed again
as he suggested the story of his life
could be written iii "the simple
annals of the poor." Brought tip
on a fartrr itr St. Lawrence County,
Dr. Walker explained he was prac-
tically grown tip before he saw a
Democrat; tltcrr he added hastily
that he is, however, open—minded
and that he quite often “kicks over
the trtrecs to vote for another
party."

Soon the Professor of Economics
and Sociology w.ll resign with art
eye to the future. Till now he has
made no plans, but asserted, "I
ought to find something to do in
assist in tire war work, and I shall
errdt-ttvoi' to do what I can to corr-
tr'ibuic to the needs of the nation
at this time."

[Gondoliers’ Cast
Televise Operetta

The cast of The Gortdolicrs gave
its televisioncd versitrn of the Gil-
bert .urd Sullivan opcrotta chncs-
day afternoon from the General
Electric experimental studio. This
is the second time the Operatic So—
ciety has given a television broad-
cast. the first being last year whctr
they gave the shortened version of
The Pirates- of Pettzurtce.

Giving a televised broadcast irr—
vofvcd presenting air abbreviated
version of the opcrctia seen by Static
College students several weeks ago.
The area itr which the action goes
or. is about 15 feet wide. Two
cameras are used in recording the
action, one for close—ups and one for
longer distance shots. A portable
rrrierophorrc sci ttpon a crane fol—
lows the principals around the
stage. One central control man
directs the action of the camera
from a booth overlooking the scene,
telling the camera men when to
record it close-up or a long shot.

The make-up necessary is very
slight That which was used for
most of the cast was pancake
make-up. Those who were for—
tunate enough to see the broadcast
probably recognized the satire cos—
tumes used in the presentation here
at school.

The small area allotcd to tire
player's tirade it necessary to use
half of the cast in the First Act and
the other half iii the Second Act.

One of the principals, Jcan Mac—
Allistcr, '43. cotrrrrrenting on how it
all felt, said, "It's just like being
III the rriovics."

Swamps SEB

A 1505",, increase in demand for
secondary school teachers has been
noted in the Student Employment
Bureau, according to Paul C. Bulger,
Director.

To meet his demand, SEB had ap-
proximately 100 Seniors who are
preparing to teach on Provisional
certificates. The possibility of older
teachers, who have retired from the
profession, is now being investigated
as a means of relieving the shortage.

The urgency for fulfilling present
demands is evidenced in the in-
creased salaries offered. The average
is $1,450. This past year, many
teachers received bonuses in recog-
nition of the rise in the cost of liv-
ing.

Mr. Bulger says of the situation,
“We need teachers in New York
State and good ones. Students in
the College should keep this in
mind in realizing their responsibil-
ity on this campus, and iii influenc-
ing high school Seniors to enter
the profession.”

Student Employment Bureau has
recently placed more people in
teaching positions. The following
are from the Class of 1943:

Marie Bailie, Aliamont, English-
Latin—Spanish; Karlene Luff Dc—
Palrrrti, Roesslevillc, Math-Social
Studies; Jane Walsh, Edmeston,
Coirimer 1:.

SEE .ras also placed a number of
graduates:

Mary C. Brierion, '42, Rcmson;
Mary Carpenter, ‘42, Coeymans;
Jean Erath, '42, Callieoon, English-
Social Studies; Theresa Hunt, '40.
Greenwich, Commerce-Social Stud—

Rienow Writes

Book On Civics

“You can't write a textbook for a
nation, btii the students iii a school
should have a textbook that they
can apply to the community in
which they are living," said Dr.
Robert liienow, Assistant Professor
of Social Studies, of his recently
published book, (.‘ttfling All Citizens.

Calling All Citizens is intended
prirrrrtr'ily as a textbook for eighth
and ninth grades in a course gen—
erally termed Civics, and it may
be filled into the seventh grade
Social Studies curriculum of New
York State. The text book is de—
.signed to meet the needs of a full
year course, but the author suggests
that with proper selections, ti otte-
setitestei‘ course, based on this book,
t'utt be taught.

l)r. Ricnow wrote the book over
a four-year period, It is his second
publication, hit-t first book being it
technical coirrpilatiotr. The new
book is under the editorship of
llownrd li. Anderson, Associate
Professor of ‘ltiucntiori of Cornell
University and Director of Social
Studies iii the lthnerr Public Schools.

Dr. lfietiow explains his theory
itr writing the book; "In pt'iiriitive
tribes the cerctirotty and trtritrittg of
youth ill the time of udoicscncc is
entrusted to all the people in the
eotntirtutliy. It is a tribal matter
bringing the young people into tire
tribe Thus, the local banker, the
local post man, the local trtrck
driver, ttttd the local party leader
should have an opportutiity to train
the young people iii our communi-
ties.” With this purpose in mind,
Dr. lticnow wrote Calling All ('111-
was with it direct address to the
pupil and with tr local approach.

By Jane Heath

 

She writes poetry, she loves to
travel, she’s a psychologist. A
glance into the MATH office will
indicate that she is also. . . .

Mrs. Fee came to State in Febru-
ary to help relieve the vacancy left
by Dr. Caroline Lester and Dr. Ellen
Stokes.

Mrs. Fee began teaching imme-
diately after her graduation from
high school, at which time a college
education was not required.

Site left the pedagogical profes-
sion when she married. (Her pur-
itanical moiher-in-law believed
married women shouldn’t teach.)

But one fine day, her village
school desperately needed a vice-
principal. The Board of Directors
had been left in the lurch, and they
pleaded with Mrs. Fee to come to
their assistance. She did, with the
intention of helping out until the
principal could go to Albany to get
a teacher. He went. But instead
of bringing back a teacher, he
brought a temporary license.

This unexpected position resulted
in Mrs. Fee’s staying there six
years, sans contract.

When her husband’s work brought
him to Albany, Mrs. Fee decided to
attend NYSCT and get her longed—
for degree. She completed her edu—
cation in three years, receiving her
B.A. in 1927. In the fall of that
year, Mrs. Fee substituted at State
while waiting for Dr. DoBell to ﬂing
open the portals of the math depart—
ment.

With Dr. DoBell's arrival, she
went to St. Agnes school to “sub”
for a few days; and that, too, lasted
—for ten years.

Mrs. Fee says her hobby is adopt-
iirg children. But she also admits
her love for travel, having toured
from the Paciﬁc Coast to Florida.

Mrs. Fee is fond of State and
thinks the students very friendly.
Of State College as a college, she
says, "I think State docs—as well
as any college I know~—what it was
designed to do: turn out good
teachers".
