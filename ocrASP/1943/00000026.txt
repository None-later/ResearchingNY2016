Sports
Chatter

By
Pete MorcheMa

 

 

In spite of the many obstacles
furnished by the man shortage at
college and the inclement weather,
Harry Kensky, entirely through his
own eﬂorts, has fashioned together
a tennis squad to represent the
Alma Mater in intercollegiate com—
petition. When all hope was lost
for another varsity sport in this
year's program, Kensky came
through with what Will undoubt-
edly be the last varsity sport at
State for the duration. _

His love for tennis and his inter-
est in keeping State College in the
sports world inspired the captain-
manager-coach to make tentative
arrangements with other colleges
for a schedule, even before a team
had been organized.

We wish to congratulate Harry
Kensky for his indomitable spirit
to keep sports functioning. It is
this kind of spirit that must be
maintained in these times, not only
in sports, but also in every other
activity in the college. This ex-
ample is best set for us by the
"Business as Usual" signs which
adorn the front of bomb-wrecked
stores of war-torn Europe.

* tit Iii

We were very much disappointed
to hear that the remants of Intra—
mural Council have decided that the
softball trophy will not be awarded
to the winner of this year's soft-
ball league. Council claims that
teams contesting are to few.

A four team league may be a
small one, but when there is a
handsome trophy lying around not
being used, we fail to see why it
should not be presented to the
team that emerges champion. The
cup will also create a greater incen-
tive for participation and help to
keep the league organized.

The individual prizes that Intra—
mural Council has planned to give
the members of the winning team
instead of the trophy may replace
the cup as a reward. However, we
still would like to have the “Bus-
iness As Usual” policy mentioned
above to be mentioned in State
College sports as long as possible.

Two weeks ago we mentioned
something about the reorganization
of our gym classes. So far no
action has been taken by anyone in
authority. Soon we hope, the
spring weather will arrive and the
gym classes can be held outdoors.
However, some deﬁnite plan must
be arranged before gym classes can
prove of any value outdoors. We
would like to suggest that periods
available for gym classes be listed
in the men's locker room so that all
men can sign up for those periods
which are convenient to them.

There may be some men omitted
by this scheme, as not all may have
free periods at the designated time
for gym classes. However. we are
sure that it will prove an improve-
ment over the Iackadaisical proc-
edure now in effect.

Rain Cancels Hiking;
MAN at Ball Practice

The spring season is having a litle
difliculty in getting started. About
twenty girls signed up for hiking
but the outing arranged for last
Tuesday was cancelled on account
of rain. Leah Tischlcr has been
appointed captain

Softball practice was held this
week behind the Dorm, but the
teams are still unformed. An added
attraction to the natural appeal of
the sport was contributed last Mon-
day by Ensign Dill Dickson, U.S.N.
who joined in the game. Dot
Townsend and Mary Now, captains,
again urge teams which wish to
participate in the tourney to submit
the names of their members before

Statesman Meet
BPI Racketeer:
In Opener Today

This afternoon marks the opening
of the 1943 tennis season as the
representatives from State meet
Brooklyn Poly on the Ridgeﬁeld
Courts. This should be a fair
opener for the Statesmen since
Brooklyn Poly bowed to Columbia
last week 9-0. After this contest
the team will prepare to invade
New York tomorrow where St.
John's will play host.

It would appear as though only
seven men at State are still deter-
mined to keep this college repre-
sented in intercollegiate athletic
circles and uphold the tradition of
winning tennis at State. These
seven men, the only candidates for
the six-man tennis squad, are all
who responded to the call of Harry
Kensky, captain, coach, business
manager, and only veteran among
the seven.

His prospective teammates now
include “Dutch” Erbstein, “Riz”
Hansen, and four yearlings, Chil-
lemi, Ferber, Miner, and Hand, but
more will be welcomed.

Kensky‘s interest and efforts have
been rewarded as far as attainment
of a schedule is concerned, but the
unsettled weather of the capital
area has opposed outdoor drilling.
Despite lack of practice, the poten-
tial racquetteers hope to upset these
opponents.

Then if weather permits and
practice becomes possible, they hope
to confront RPI, Cortland, and the
others pending. The several out of
town contests should make this sea-
son a success in one sense of the
word at least.

The tennis schedule which has
been arranged to date is:

April 30 Brooklyn Poly (home)
May 1 _ . St. John’s (away)
May 14 R. P. I. (home)
May 21 . R. P. I. (away)

Two matches are also scheduled

tentatively with Cortland.

Softball Trophy
In Not at Stake

Intramural Council decided at a
recent meeting that because there
are not enough teams contesting.
the softball title of champion would
not be challenged. In accordance,
the title cup will remain with last
year's winners, the Ramblers, until
State College gets running smoothly
on a post-war schedule.

The Intramural softball trophy
has had a relatively short history,
being in existence for only three
years. SLS won the cup the first
year and the Potter Club team
claimed it the year following. Last
year the Ramblers took over.

Ilowcver, softball will still be
played. Dr. Saylcs has given his
approval and the field in front of
Page Hall is available from 5:30
p. lit. n every day but Friday. The
only drawback is the weather.

The typical Albany wetness has
llllls fnr retarded actual league play,
although many of the fellows have
already been practicing.

Intramural Council find asked for
umpires and to-date, eight have
signed up. There are four teams
altogether. Gillen and Reed, in
t'lhlltlt', have decided that two
round. of six games each will be
polycd, with one game going on
inn-h night.

Rivary Game Wednesday

'l'hr- Freshman-Sophomore Wo-
llll‘l rivalry softball contest will be
[noted Wednesday afternoon on the
hop ficld 'I'lie winning team will
to awarded three rivalry points.

At last the literary merits of the
women's sports staff have met with
recognition. Joan Hylind of the
sophomore sports staff has been el—
ected Editor of the Freshman Hand—
book. This breaks the hold which
the editorial side of the NEWS has
had on this position for many years.
Joan, however, promises not to let
WAA dominate the Handbook. On
the staff, too, is Marie DeChene,
the other member of the women’s
sports staff. Congratulations to Jean!

If it wasn’t that there's so little
point to adding any more water to
the atmosphere of Albany, we might
well shed a tear for WAA and its
spring sports season. Plans are all
made, captains have been chosen,
the girls are eager to participate,
but Mother Nature refuses to co—
operate. There hasn't been any
good weather since spring arrived.
Only one ray of sunshine appears
and that is but a faint gleam. It
can't go on raining forever. Or
can it?

Some fair day in May, the stu-
dents of State will be treated to a
unique sight. The girls in blue
and the girls in red (in other words,
the freshmen and sophomores in
their gym suits) will battle for the
enviable (1’) title of "Queens of
Calisthenics". lVFIS Johnson an-
nounced this plan to the accom-
paniment of groans from the mus-
cle—bound members of '45 and '46.

Seriously though, we think the
idea is good. As we have said in
a recent column, it is important
now, as never before, that American
women keep themselves physically
strong and healthy. Calisthenics,
with its emphasis on muscular co-
ordination, is one of the best me-
thods of accomplishing this result.
If the girls will support Miss John-
son in her efforts and will take the
exhibition serioualy, the idea can
be developed into something really
worthwhile. In fact, we would go
as far as suggesting that rivalry
points be awarded to the winner of
the exhibition.

Women Athletes Start
Spring Sports Series

Golf, one of the new sports ol'fer-
ed this spring, has begun. Practice
was held last Wednesday at 3:30 p.
m. in the gym. From reports on
the turnout, it seems that this will
be a very popular innovation Miss
Isabelle Johnson, instructor of phy-
sical education, is supervising the
sport. When the weather clears
and the ground dries, practice will
be held on the field in back of
Draper.

The following is by way of a

Myskania Tapping Climaxes
Page Panorama Tomorro_w__

 

 

What is Myskania‘.’ Almost any—
one in college will give you a dif-
ferent answer. "It's the most pop—
ular and brilliant group of students
in school," “the chosen few, chosen
by a few," “The leaders of the Col—
lege." No matter what we may
think of it, Myskania is here to
stay, it. seems. Or at least twenty-
scven years of existence wt)qu
seem to warrant some Justification
for its continuation.

The Day of Judgement for Mysk-
ania is Moving-Up Day. The hopes
and fears of three years are, or are
not realized, as the case maybe in
a few minutes of suspense unrivaled
by anything else in college exper—
ience.

The crowning of a king of Eng—
land has scarcely as much. pomp
and ceremony as the Myskama tap-
ping has. Freshmen, peering over
from their balcony heights, are 'in—
itiated into the most colorful im—
pressions of their college years.
The Class of '45 was the last ‘10
taste its excitement, the Class of 46
will soon know it.

Last May when the present Mys-
kania was tapped, the suspense was
as high as ever. One by one the
out—going Myskania descended from
the stage, arms encased in their
long black robes, circled the aud~
itorium, stopped and a new Mys—
kania member was born. Then
came the return trip, this time
there were twu, up the steps, and
onto the stage to receive the plati-
dits of the assembly. Eleven times
was this repeated, until each mem—
ber of the old Myskunia had tapped
his successor. But this was not
the end, cxcilcmciit rose even high.
or as two members rcturncd once
more to round out the number of
new Iiiembcrs of thirteen, the full
quota allotcd to the organization,
a quota that is not often filled
'l'lien if was finished and the new

years ago. ,

Pre-Moving-Up Day lhoughfs

By Barbara l'u tnain

At a table in the Commons this
morning sat four girls, each with
an open book in front of her. Not
an unusual sight - but a close ob-
servcr Would notice that not a page
of any of the books was being
turned, and that four pairs of eyes
were staring vacanlly iiilo space.

Let's don our lclcpatliic ear-
phones and time in on the minds of
these four co~cds. First the fresh—
man. . . .

" . So tomorrow is Moving-Up

The Sophomore wears a compla-

It ought to be fun . . . I've got
Myskania all figured out, I think

The Senior looks serious and

some way, after listening in. . .

"M“ving-Up Day! It doesn't seem

It will be queer, seeing those kids

New Myskania,-
Election Results
Out Tomorrow

By Jane Heath

Aged by 29 years of tradition and
lavish with ceremony, Moving-Up
Day tomorrow will summarize an-
other year of college activities. An
all—college pageant, the tapping of
the New Myskania, the announce—
ment of Student Association and
organization leaders for the coming
year, and a ﬁnal showing of inter—
class rivalry form, in the main, the
day's program.

The four classes will assemble at
8:30 A. M. in Draper and Huested
Halls and in the connecting peri—
style. At 9 A. the cap-and-
gowned Seniors will lead the color-
ful procession to Page Hall audi-
torium where the ceremonies are
scheduled for 9:20 A. M.

Members of each underclass will
appear in uniform dress in their
respective class colors.

Class Speakers Open

Student Association President
Don Vanas will conduct the Page
meeting, first order of business
being the class speeches. Terrence
Smyth, ‘46, will speak for the fresh-
man class. The Sophomore Class
Speaker will be Marge Curran.
Trece Aney, will represent the
Junior Class; and Cliff Swanson, the
Senior Class.

Some of the suspense of the day
will be lessened by the announce—
ment of awards and election results,
which follows the class speeches.
The incoming officers of Pi Gamma
Mu, Pi Omega Pi, Commerce Club,
Forum, Spanish Club, Newman
Club, and Hillel will be given recog-
nition. The awards include the
scholarship cup by Interfraternity
Council, and Press Bureau and
Potter Club honors.

The Seniors' farewell song, led by
Jean McAllister, '43, will precede
the Moving—Up ceremony. Hal
Singer, '43, Grand Marshal, will
conduct the classes to new seats in
the auditorium. This procedure is
the epitome of Moving-Up Day's
symbolism.

Myskania Taps Next

The tapping of next year's Mys-
kania will follow. Tomorrow's tap—
ping will mark the beginning of the
twenty-eighth year of Myskania's
existence.

The final announcements will
conclude the morning order of busi-
tiess. The News Board, and the
Primer and Pedngugite staffs will
be named. Also Debate Council
and Music Council ofﬁcers and
i1icinl.>ei's, Residence Council mem—
bers, mid ofﬁcers of Dramatic and
Art Association. Student Christian
Association, and WAA and MAA
will be announced. At this time
result,- of Student Association and
class voting will be given.

After singing the National An-
them, the student body will file
from the auditorium and onto the
lawn in front of Page Hall. There
each class will form its class num-

Supplementary Issue Tomorrow

The Moving-Up Day supplement

undo of Draper Hall at 12 p. in.
tomorrow afternoon after Moving-
Up ceremonies.

The supplement, edited by Muriel
