Cooper House

Will Be Closed
For Next Year

When this year’s Senior Class
leaves State’s campus, with it will
go James Fenimore Cooper House,
the cooperative house which Was
new when the class of 1943 were
freshmen. According to a state—
ment made by Dean Stokes, the
cost of upkeep has become too
great to make the maintenance of
the house practical.

The building was erected by
Thurlow Weed, Republican political
boss of New York state in the time
of William Seward, for the use of
his family. The room which is now
used as a house mother’s room was
occupied by Mr. Weed’s study. Later
the house was purchased by James
Fenimore Cooper III, grandson of
the author, who resided there until
his death. At one time the college
tried to purchase the property for
offices, but it was not until 1939 that
Miss Mildred Shorday leased the
property to house the cooperative
group which had formerly been
known as Junipers Junior. For two
years the apartment over the barn
was known as Cooper House Annex
and served as a home for six girls.
When Junipers, the oldest coopera-
tive on campus, was forced to close
last June, eight of the girls moved
to Cooper.

The house contains thirty rooms
and this year housed thirty-three
girls, two houseboys, and a house
mother. Mrs. Mary MacDonald. The
work is done by the girls under a
voluntary system with Muriel
Hughes, ’44; Patricia Christopher.
'45, and Martha Shaver, '46, serving
as work captains. Two of the six
Seniors in the house, Mary Mac—
Manus and Jane Greenmun White,
have lived there since the house was
established. Mrs. White is house
president. and the other ofiicers for
the past year include Muriel
Hughes, vice-president; Virginia
France, '45. secretary, and Iona
Skinner. ’45, treasurer.

Underclassmen Chuckling
As Seniors Hope for Prize

Why have the Seniors got that
“eat that swallowed the canary"
look these days? Rumor has it
that they're sure that the first
prize for the Moving-Up Day
Song Contest is in the bag.

"Oh yeah". say the Frosh and
the Sophs and the Juniors collec-
tively. giving each other a know-
ing nudge.

“YEAH”, say the Seniors and
they, too, give each other a know-
ing nudge. "You bet we're going
to win". pipes up Jean MucAllis-
tcr. Senior Song Leader.

Well. we'll see. and it'll be a
great day when this Senior class
wins the song contest on Moving-
Up Day.

 

Composer-Artist Percy Groinger
To Be Moving-Up Day Star

 

As every year rolls around, so
another Moving-Up Day goes by.
Tomorrow Music Council will pre-
sent a valid argument for the re-
membrance of Moving—Up Day,
1943. At 4 P. M., in Page Hall, State
College students and their guests
will have the distinct pleasure of
listening to the music of a man who
speaks, writes, and acts as he
pleases—the foremost American pi—
anist, Percy Grainger.

The secret of Graingcr's success
lies in his utter disregard for con-
vention. If he is so inclined, he will
walk cross-country from one con—
cert engagement to another, rather
than take a train. On many occa—
sions he has unobstrusively walked
into the side door of a spacious
auditorium, a small, quiet man with
a knapsack on his back. He is an
amazing athlete, and despises rich
food and soft beds. For being an
outdoor man with a lust for life
and an appreciation of his art, he
has been classed as an eccentric:
but his dislike for easy living and
his love for the open air have added
an invigorating and ambitious lift
to his compositions.

Percy Grainger has been an out-
standing pianist, composer. and con-
ductor for over fiftv years. and still
remains completely unsclfconscious.

by Marion Buetow

 

Says Glenn Dillard Gunn of the
“Country Gardens" man, “He comes
to make music and is eager to be
about his assignment.”

Grainger will be supported by
the State College Women’s Chorus
in his piano recital tomorrow. High
spots of the program will be his in—
terpretations of “Polonaise in A
Flat", by Chopin; “Islamey”, Bali-
kcriff; “Fantasia”, a Fugue in A
minor, Bach; and "Clair dc Lune",
Debussy.

In days gone by the afternoon of
Moving-Up Day has been reserved
for the class stunts, each of the
classes taking part. Some of us re-
member with nostalgia, the sight of
Bea Dowor and Freddy Day, gid-
dily careening off the Page Hall
stage on a tandem bicycle after rid-
ing a precarious course over various
obstacles; the same Dower, as the
“Blue Myskania", swinging through
the air on a frail piece of rope: and
the slap—happy presentation of the
class of '43, a parody on “Pinaforc”.

True. these stunts are buried with
the past, but they are the forerun-
ners of the rivalry skits. The
Grainger program comes as an in-
novation in the annals of State. and
Music Council is setting a precedent
which State shall possibly continue
in the coming decades.

Chatter

By
Pete Marchella

 

 

Tomorrow —— Moving —— Up Day!
This day marks the first of a series
of ceremonies which indicates that
the Class of 1943 is nearing the end
of its stay in the Alma Mater.
Along with the rest of the robed
seniors will be ye ole Sports Editor.

While the rest of you undergrad-
uates are moving up, we are moving
out; moving out to take our places
on the battlefields of the World and
in schoolhouscs. In this, the last
issue to be edited by the present
NEWS board, we will try to make
our last feeble attempt at “Sports
Chatter."

Among the many persons and
things that will be absent at State
next year is intercollegiate com-
petition. Such a situation is not
only not inexcusable but manda-
tory under present conditions.

Sports of State College have since
their introduction been on an up—
,iade. Athletic competition prob-
..my got its start with intcrclass

..s and soon developed to var—
..._, oaskctball. Intercollegiate foot-
ball for a brief period, cross country,
baseball and tennis were introduced
in that order to State.

Sports ﬁnally reached their peak
in 1935 with the introduction of
the Men's Athletic Association.
This placed administrative power
of sports in almost complete control
of a Student Council. Two years
later this council was further aug-
mented by a sub-division to regu—
late intramural sports. This system
persistcd until the present war dis-
rupted proceedings.

State College prides itself in being
one of the few colleges in which
the entire sport program is sub-
sidized with student funds. It is
unlike those colleges where the
school supports athletics and vice-
versa.

Now that sports are definitely out
for the duration we would like to
offer a few suggestions of what to
do during this interim.

1. Keep an athletic program
functioning. This may be organ-
ized as the men next your best see
fit. They may keep the present
system as used by Intramural Coun—
cil or appoint an athletic committee
to arrange and plan sports events.
Have a sports program if at if] pos-
sible,

2. Keep the sports organized.
It's spirit of competition that makes
sports so interesting and enjoyable.
Have team competition whenever
possible. If not, then use tourna-
ments or other forms of individual
competition in carrying out what-
ever sport program is established.
It's by organization that competition
is best achieved.

25. Attempt women's intercollegi-
nte sports. Women's varsity sports
have existed in colleges for some
years. We Would like to see State
wumcn take the initiative to make
arrangements with other colleges
for contests in various sports. If
nearby wouu-n's collcgcs do not
cooperate at first we hope that the
State women will be persistent and
make attempts to convince them.

4. Make a list of the sport rec-
ords of State. At present there are
no records of any kind to be found
in any of the files of MAA or Intra-
mural Council 'l‘hc files of the
NEWS could be used to obtain the
data and organizc a record book.

5. Do some post—war planning.
This period of sport inactivity
can wolf serve as a preparation for
a post—war athletic program. The
possibilities of a six mun football
league could be seriously consider-
ed. lIcttcrs can be sent to other
small colleges and normal schools
who find themselves in the same
pi'cdicnincnl as Stutc in regards to
football. 'I‘hcir opinions can be re—
cclvcd and ideas exchanged.

Basketball, baseball and tennis
will be returning after the war and
it will take proper planning to
reinstate them in a sport program.
Improper planning may cause delay
which may postpone these sports
unnecessarily for a season or two,

STATE COLLEGE NEWS, FRIDAY, MAY 7, W43

Dorm, Finks Score Victories

As Softball Season Opens

Thirteen-Run Outburst
Decides First Game;
Finks Pummel Gerber

The softball season opened auspi-
ciously Tuesday, as the Dorm wal-
loped Potter 16-8. The following
day Rho Beta Sigma succumbed to
the Finks, 10-6.

The Dorm greeted Potter with a
thirteen~run outburst in the first
inning, and with Smyth on the
mound, coasted to an easy victory.
Seventeen men faced Welch, the
Potter pitcher, as the entire Potter
machine fell apart in this first in-
ning. After that, however, it was
a good ball game, as Weleh settled
down and pitched a creditable game.
Potter tried desperately to get back
in the ball game, but Smyth, after
a couple of rocky innings, never
allowed them to threaten.

Get Thirteen Hits

The Dorm collected thirteen hits,
only two of them, however, f'or
extra bases. Potter garnered twelve
off Smyth, six of them being for
extra bases, but runs still determine
the winner.

Bert Kiley got the first home run
of the season in the second inning,
with one on. Hammond led the
Potter attack with a double and two
singles. The Dorm attack was well
spread out, with Chillemi, Reichard,
Wood}, Smyth, Miner, and Laurie
each garnering two hits.

The Finks jumped to a five-run
lead in the first two innings, and
never were headed. 'I'uckcr pitched
all of the way. having the game well
under control at all times. Gerber
pitched a good game for the Rho
Beta Sigma team, but sewed tip too
three extra base blows.

(.‘ollect Fourteen Blows

The Finks rapped out fourteen
hits oll‘ Gerber. with eight of them
being for extra bases. Tucker scat-
tered ten hits and allowed only
three base blows.

Olivct led the Fink attack with
a double and two singles, Doc
Beyer] also had a triple and a
double. Gerber and Abrams had
two hits apiece for the conglomera—
tion outfit.

The Dorm ﬁeld was the scene of
these first two games, but it is
expected that the Page Hall field
will be used for the remaining
games scheduled. All games this
year are scheduled to start at 6:30,
but there is a possibility that a few
may be played at 4:30 PM.

 

Slate Rocketeers
Lose First Game

St. John’s Too Powerful;
Cancel Brooklyn Poly Match

State tennis squad was swamped
by a powerful St. Johns' sextet to
the tune of 9-0 in their match last
Saturday in New York. As the
score indicates, St. John's had a
vastly superior team, with two of
the players ranking on the ﬁrst ten
nationally. Though badly defeated,
the State racketeers put up a still'
battle.

To-datc, the St. Johns’ team has
beaten Columbia. They will play
Princeton (one of the top teams of
the country), NYU, and No. Car—
olina, among others.

Not only were the men tops, but
also the coach. One year he rea-
ched the semi-finals of the national
single championship, finally being
eliminated by the great Donald
Budge.

Ninety-Mile Gale

As if this were not enough, a
ninety—mile gale was blowing.
Quoting Kensky, “Other than the
above, everything else was equal."

Bob Ferber, frosh, came closest
to winning. He had his man “mat—
ched point", but lost in a gruelling
three set match.

Their number two man, James
McGuire. is the intercollcgeatc
champ and easily defeated Jim
Miner 6-0, 6-1.

Captain Kensky had an early lead,
but also lost. His man, Bunny
Smith, is undefeated in intercol-
Icgeatc competition.

The squad was hit with a tough
break when Frank Hansen tore a
ligament in his right leg and will
be out for the remainder of the
sea'on. This leaves only six men
on a six man team!

Play Next Week

A heavy schedule is tenatch for
next weekend. Friday afternoon
State will play RPI and Saturday,
Cortland. Both games are away
and practice will be held at Ridge-
field during next week.

Brooklyn Poly. scheduled for last
Friday afternoon, was rained out.
Instead of the game, they toured
the school.

Interesting to note is what they
said about their visit. “The school
as a whole is really tops," said one
of thorn. They enjoyed the tour
and marvelled at the campus.

Rabbit Chasing Funny—-
For All Expect the Bunny

Meatless days were nearly over
for some State men when Oscar,
the Rabbit, an erstwhile softball
fan decided to attend a softball
game at the dorm field. Sunday.
The players, desiring to appease
their appetites attacked en masse.

However, the Steak, I mean
Oscar, loudly protesting that he
was not the umpire, staged a
beautiful broken ﬁeld run to
wend his way through a gauntlet

Now after receiving the bless-

bewails the life of a rabbit and
curses Hitler.

Sophs Triumph _
In Rivalry Contest

The Fresh cause is a lost cause
and the rivalry softball game did
little to bolster their fast-fading
morale. The score was 34-25 in
favor of the Crimson Tide'but
neither side played a good game.
Both teams were rusty, plainly dis-
playing their fack of practice this
season. The fielders fumbled the
ball—missing flies and grounders.
Pitching was sloppy and more runs
were gained by walking than by
hitting.

Seymour, '46. and Valente, ’45,
made some skillful stops which
brought cheers from the crowd.
Giavclli, '45, brought the spectators
to their feet with two smashing
home runs.

The game would undoubtedly
have been more exciting if the girls
had had more time for practice.
There has been only one day when
the weather permitted practice.

The victorious Sophomores were
represented by: Bostwick, Fillman,
Garfalf, Giavclli, Hall, Now, San-
dcrson, Stewart, ’I‘ischler and
Valente. Lineup for the Class of
'46 was, Buetow, Casey, Elgie, Sey-
mour, Herlihy, Lulkowski, Bullock,
Lo Faro, Quinn,Shoupc and Harper.

 

Now, Townsend Disclose

Teams In Tournament

Dot Townsend, '44, and Mary Now,
'45, captains of softball have an-
nounced that the following teams
will participate in the spring soft-
ball tourney: Beta Zeta, Cooper
House, Dclta-Beta-Chi, Kappa
Delta, Newman Hall, Psi Gamma,
and Wren Hall.

It is hoped that the weather will
stay clear and the ground will be
in condition for the tournament to
Limit next week. The captains are
still undecided as to how the games
will be played off as there is not
enough time left for each team to
play every other team.

    

It Could
Be

Wurz

 

 

’In time of spring a young
mans fancy may turn to thoughts
of love, but judging by some of the
farewell columns in past years, a
sports writer's thoughts turn to
poetry. Just what brings on this
noble impulse, I’m not quite sure.
Perhaps it’s a desire to prove to the
world. that there are hidden depths
even in the heart of a sports writer
——a desire for beauty crushed by
the demands of a stylized form of
writing.

Yet why should this be true of
writing about sports? It is not
the material . Most sports are
interesting and alive. They are
played in surroundings that are
often beautiful in colorful costumes.
People are shown at their best or
their worst when they participate
in sports. It is the fault of the type
of writing that has become the
standard for sports writers to copy.
Willi Malice Toward None

Few parts, if any, of a newspaper
are written with any concern for
literary merit. This is as it should
be. Production of the great Ameri-
can novel is not the purpose of a
paper. But is this any excuse for
the triteness and poor writing that
has long been a characteristic of
the sports page?

I may be treading on sensitive
toes, but I'm also treading on my
own. It is my hope that those who
have preceded me will not think
that I'm condemning them. Such
» not my intention. Probably they
I 't the same feeling of satisfaction
that I'm feeling. It's only at the
end of the year that I can see what
I'd like to have done.

Toward the Future

Next year I’d like to see a new
philosophy adopted by the sports
department. Let them forget the
easy cliches. the ready tricks of
pluasing. Let them ignore the list.
of meaningless expressions that ruin
any chance for good writing.

It is easy to fall into the habit
of writing the same story each
week, merely changing the names.
But each game is different, no twu
people play in exactly the same
way. The sports writer should at-
tempt to combine enthusiasm with
knowledge and critical judgment.

Anything we do possesses only
the merit that we give it. As long
as sports writers continue to believe
that theirs is a type of writing to
be done in a sterotyped manner,
they will produce poor writing. I
hope that next year we will see an
attempt at a new type of sports
writing for State College—a type
worth writing and reading.
