Brock and Hines
To Head Guides

The office of the Dean of Women
has released the appointment of
Herbert. Brock, ’44, and Ruth Hines,
’45, as Student Guide Co-Chairman’
for 1943-44. -'

Dr. Stokes explained that because
of the shortage of men in the class
of ’45, it was necessary to select a
man from the incoming Senior class
as one of the chairmen.

This appointment of a Senior
the customary “Junior Guides" to
necessitates the change in tile from
“Student Guides”.

' The duty of Guides is to meet and

escort the freshmen in their ﬁrst
week of college. Each Guide has
three or four “freshmen sisters” or
“brother” to whom they write before
the semester begins, describing
State and its extra-class activities.

There will be a list posted on the
bulletin board outside of the Dean
of Women’s office for Student Guide
volunteers to sign up. Dr. Stokes
says, “More women Guides will be
needed for next year. All students
interested please sign as soon as
possible".

A quota will be selected from the
list of volunteers. These students
will be informed of their duties be-
fore the end of the semester.

Guides this year have assumed
additional duties by assisting at
present with freshmen interviews
and escorting prospective students
to the various faculty members.

Senior Pictures Due May 15

Frances Bourgeois, ’43, Director
of the State College Press Bureau
has announced that all Seniors must
have their pictures in to Press Bu-
reau before May 15.

This is necessary if the Seniors
wish notices put in their home—
town newspapers about graduation
and contracts.

STATE COLLEGE NEWS, FRIDAY MAY 7, 1943

AD Presentation Predicatcd Ratio for Next Year

5 C A Office Cools Off
After 200 Degree Heat

Last Saturday the SCA-Newman-
Hillel office was destroyed by hot
steamer from a broken valve under
the Commons.

The valve broke about 4:30 A. M.
Saturday morning, but was not dis-
covered by the janitors till 9 A. M.
the same morning. Since the win-
dow was closed, the steam had very
little outlet and the office had
reached a temperature of 200 de-
grees at the time of the discovery.
A great part of the SCA library was
either watersoaked or burned by
the steam. The walls were blistered
and the paint burned from the desk
tops. Fortunatelv the SCA ballots
were in the steel file cabinet, which
was left intact.

It will be necessary to refurnish
and redecoratc the entire office, but
it is doubtful if this will be done
till next year.

Alumni Pledge Blanks
Ready for Class of '43

Jane Edmunds, '43,has announch
that alumni pledge cards are now
available for members of the Senior
Class. This year. because of the
war, only the women are asked to

tion of Sayles Hall and the main-
tenance of both Alumni Residence
Halls. The usual amount requested

convenience, each contributor may

Slated May 2i

The Advanced Dramatics play,
Ladies in Retirement, scheduled for
presentation in Page Hall on May 21,
is now in advanced stage of pro—
duction. Miss Agnes E. Futtcrer,
Assisstant Professor of English, and
director of the Percy and Denham
play, says “It is shaping up very
nicely." ‘

The cast, comprised entirely of
students from the Advanced Dra—
matics class, includes such veterans
as Rhona Ryan, Trcce Aney, Lois
Hampcl, Mary Studebaker, Marjorie
Brcunig, and Harold Ashworth.

The play is essentially a melo—
drama, though not of the “Curse
You, Jack Dalton” variety. Miss
Aney plays it murdcrcss, Misses
Studebaker and Breunig two mad
sisters, Miss Ryan a lady who “gets
around", Miss Hampel a flirt, and
Mr. Ashworth a two—faced schemcr.

This play has been performed on
Broadway and in the movies by top-
notch actors.

Admission may be gained by slu-
dcnt tax tickets.

 

Budget Survey

The Student Association, at the
Budget Session last Friday, voted to
inth the Student Tux lowered to
$12.

This reduction is possible as a
result of the $2,024.45 decrease in
the 1934-44 budget, as well as the
anticipated surplus.

The budget was passed with little
comment and no alteration.

The STATE Course News, D&A,
WAA. Infirmary Fund, Student
Council, and the Freshmen Hand--
book sought slight II'lCl't‘ilSCS. The
other activities all took cuts with
the exception of the Literary Au-
nual, Secretarial Contingent, Treas-
urer's Bond, and the Press Bureau,
which kept their present status.

   
 
 
 
     
     
       
      
      
 

Nine Women for Every Male

 

If Wednesday’s showing of high
school seniors applying for college
is indicative of the trend of next
year’s freshman class, the ratio of
women to men will be 0 to 1. One-
eighteenth of the women, we pre-
dict, will submit to a vigorous
glamorization program outlined by
sophisticated roommates. Dr. Croas—
dale will prescribe monocles for at
least five per cent of the women be-
fore the Veronica Lakcs receive
their mid—semester grades. Next
year's remaining upperclassmcn
are expected to lose fraternity pins
to at least one-ninth of the frosh
women, if indeed we can predict at
all. A Marine Corps Reserve mem-
ber whistled and lamented his June
graduation at this particular one-
ninth. Said he, "Moving—Up Day
will certainly mean Moving-Out for
me. I should like to stay for that!"

Predictions for the man-power of
the Class of '47 are not encouraging.
Evert worse than the position of its
riva‘ class will be the Class of '47's.
according to Wednesday's survey.
Shortly after their eighteenth birth-
days. both men interviewed
Wednesday expect lA classifica-
tions and invitations from lhcir

draft boards. Since those inter-
viewees will leave before January,
the second semester will ﬁnd the
Class of ’47 manless, if, of course,
the showing of two days ago is an
accurate representation.

Berton Feldman of Troy and
George Frank of Scotia were the
men interviewed. With a brush cut
and pocketed hands, Feldman pon—
dered the present set-up of State.
One hand came out of his pocket
long enough to rub his chin and pat
the brush cut when he talked about
the overflow of women. Frank, em-
bryonic BMOC with a wide grin,
stated, "The ratio? It doesn’t bother
me in the least."

Among the women was a trio
from Nott Terrace with a long list
of extra-curricular activities and a
comfortable honor roll record. They
were Eleanor Williams, Virginia
Drums and Irene Prazak whose in—
lt'i'csts Would commandeer the en-
tire faculty's instruction and mom—
bcl‘sltip in almost every extra-class
organization.

Jeanne Cavnnugh was the stu—
dent predicted to be the pin—wearer
of next year's l't'osli.

not only the eight. black-gowned
members of Myskania rise from
their chairs, but George Kunz, a

has been reduced. The lost Mys—
kaniu lo have len members was that
of 1040-41. This year the women
outnumber lhc men eight to lwo.
