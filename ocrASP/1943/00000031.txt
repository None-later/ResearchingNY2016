lAnd So Tomorrow,

Once again, our captains and otrr kings have
departed, leaving behind therrr a trail of his-
tory and rrremory, and once again their succes-
sors have stepped tip from succeeding classes
into the positions left vacant by them. This is.
as always, self-evident and perennial, and it is
tints for the sake of tradition.

 

Whatever otir opinions rrray be, it is not for
us or for anyone to criticize, at this time, past
errors and clisions. What has gone before is for-
C\C1‘ gone, and a new year. a new regime and
new circumstances present to State College a
clean slate. At this time it is for its to express our
gratitude to the class of 1943, for from them we
have received friendship, assistance, and leader-
ship. 'l'hese things we have appreciated, and
these things we shall miss. To the class of 1913
we cart only say, irr order to escape sentimen-
tality, “Au rcvoir. thank you, good luck." The
usual things.

\Vhat is to corrrc will, in no sense of the word,
he usual. This we can say with assurance. State
College is entering its second ftrlltirrre war year.
The past year has been a transition year. its
situations have bccn difficult, for they have been
new. (In this basis have been its procedures.

in thc year to corrre, we shall know what to
expect. and. through experience, we shall 1lit\t' a
much better idea of what can be done. '1 here
are dcirrritc things which must be done.

litrilurc in the past to accomplish certain aims
has been cirtc to lack of cooperation front the
student body. .\ tlrorottgir and determined boy
cott of tlic .\rrrrcx rrright hatc- brought about it
rcrrrc-dy for ﬂu oit-criticilcd situation. 'l'hc
corrrplriiuts lodged against Rcsidc-ricc (Lourrcil
rrtiglrt hatc bccrr atrswcrcd satisfactorily if those
who complained had taken adiarriagc oi tlrc op
porttrrrity oilcrcd ihc'm in the council's opt-rt
meeting.

'1 hcsc situations may still bc [acctl if the stu-
dcrrt body so dcsircs. Ycl :rrrothcr casc which
has not been ltiiltllt'll is that of t‘lt'tittilts. 'l hc
apathy toward toting for class and Student .\s
sociatiorr oilrccrs was rrrotc- prorrourrcc-d than (‘H‘t
this year. 'loo icw students rcali/c: that posscs
sion of a sitidcrrt tax and its consort pritilcgc-s
are also dutics. No candidate for an oiircc can
bc fairly clcctccl urrdcr pic-scrit conditions.

llci‘c: atrcl now, or ask the student body to
consider these questions, seriously and impar-
tially. and form decisions its to their part next
year in a program for Ihc- corrrplcic dc-rrroct'ati/a-
tiorr of State (Lollcgc. 'l belt and only their can
we look for ward to next year with the hope and
anticipation We must have in order to create a
collegiate life We cart point to with pride.

’LO, SOLDIERS ’N’ SUCH,

The tapping is over, the 281/g-41/g rivalry losers have
put away their blue ribbons, and over-cutters are at-
tending classes with pre-examination fervor. The
ofﬁcial results of Moving-Up Day have all been
printed, but there’s more you must hear. There are
r'erstui’fed “other” memories to be included. Listen.

"Kip" Swanson with pedagogical solemnity, Trece
.re time still untapped, Marge Curran in Soph red,
1 Blue—Bowed Terry Smythe made their speeches
for Vioving-Up Day before a member of the largest
class of State College—your class—was introduced.
KUNZIE was back! A grin, a blush, and “Gee!”
began your representative’s short, unrehearsed speech.
For shame, Soldiers! However, at less formal gather—
ings since then, George has told us the stories we were
waiting to hear—typical Kunz tales. Now he's al-
most at the end of his furlough and will return to the
“Avon Park everglades" to earn a First Sergeant rat-
ing. Before he leaves, George intends to check off
the names on the self-propagated list in the P. O.
Eleadirig “For Kunz . . . Kissing Goodbye . . . Sign
ere.

BOB PATTON, '41, who has just received his star
and stripe upon graduation from Annapolis, came
back too. At night AL MESC'HTER helped the Sophs
win first place in rivalry sing, while BOB sang with
the third-place Seniors. RALPH FREDERICK and
GENE McLAREN, despite the parade at NYU, ar-
rived in time for the evening’s festivities. After the
sing, Pvt. PHIL MURPHY, Air Corps man from
Springfield, Mass; PFC VINCENT PAPE home from
technical school in New York, and LT. MIKE GROSS
found their way to the Commons to provide much
needed manpower.

LOUIS RABINEAU and BERNIE ARBIT bounced
home this week. Louie expects to be at Upton
for a while; he's been assisting the Chaplain at
the Post Chapel BILL DICKSON wandered
around Wednesday on a pass after many confused
Naval orders which resulted in scattering Bill's be-
longings in several spots. Forty—eight hours to collect
'em . . . CHARLIE REYNOLDS, still in a band, came

to see us too.

State's contingent at Ft. Bragg includes ART
CORNWALL, GRAHAM DUNCAN, VITO BR‘ENNI.
DICK BEACH, BERNIE BERNHARDT, ART and LEO
FLAX, JOE HIGGINS, JOE HARDER and AVVIE
KOBLENZ. Leo penned on a postcard, “Wouldn't be

South Carolina, where he complains formal introduc—
tions must precede dates with eo-eds. ERNIE MEN-
NILLO and FRAN MULLIN are roommates at Buck—
nell Jr. College in Pennsylvania. BOB LOUCKS is
at Waynesburg College, Pennsylvania, and JOE
AMYOT is at Syracuse. ART COLLINS and DANTE
ZACCANINI write from Miami. The seven of them
will learn to fly.

PAUL BARSELOU'S mail from Syracuse is differ-
ent! By the time the war ends, Paul will probably
have found a few additions to Roget’s compilation.
In the upper corner of his letters are scrawled
“Gratis,” “On the House," etc. . . . “BIG ED" REED
is stumbling over ct‘yptology at Miami . . . It’s Radar

JOHNNIE MOULD has a tale of woe from Utah.
The voice of authority demanded volunteers for work.
Johnnie passed up two menial KP jobs, but conde-
scendcd to accept a “stamping” position. Stamping
did not involve ofl'tcc work as Johnnie had supposed,
but reducing to ashes half burned lumps of coal . . .
JOHNNIE RICCARDO, who's learning to drive trucks
in Camp Sutton, North Carolina, has a success story.
In one month he became a PFC; in another he gained
a Corporal's rating . . . PFC COLLIN BARNETT is an
instructor at Quantieo . . BOB LEONARD ts attend-

Three Religious Clubs

Sponsor Lester Granger

Mr. Lester B. Granger, one of the
most distinguished negro leaders in
the country, has been secured as
the assembly speaker today through
the combined efforts of the three re—
ligious organizations, SCA, New-
man, and Hillel.

Mr. Granger is the executive sec-
retary for the Urban League, a na-
tional organization which was first
formed to mitigate th eindustrial
and social plight of the negro in
formed to mitigate the industrial
about 28 years ago during the ﬁrst
migration of negroes from the South
to New York City, at which time
jobs and living conditions were so
desperate as to necessitate some im-
mediate action.

League‘s Activities Expandch

Partly because of Mr. Granger's
valiant fight for the colored people.
this League, which was once re-
stricted to New York City, has now
expanded to embody 41 branches
throughout the country. It also
serves in an advisory capacity to
various United States employment
bureaus, and it conducts an exten—
sive research department to corre—
late with its investigations of large
industrial plants.

Mr. Granger, as present Executch
Secretary for this Urban League,
has directed a national program of
workers' education to instruct
Negro labor in history. problems
and techniques of collective bar—
gaining and trade unionism. He has
worked to make the negro an in—
tegral part of the community in
which he lives.

Dr. Louis C. Jones, Assistant Pro-
fessor of English, who has made a
stud of inter—racial conditions,
says, ‘Probably few people in the
country realize the negro problem
as much as Mr. Granger".

A. B. at Dartmouth

Mr. Granger received his A.B. at
Dartmouth and did graduate work
at New York University, the New
York School of Social Work, and
Dana College. He has also taught
in St. Augustine's College in Ra—
leigh, North Carolina, and in the
North Carolina's State Teachers
College.

While in Bordentown, New Jer:
scy, he organized the State Boys
Conference, annual State Choir
Contest. and the Annual Colored
Farmers' Institute.

Mr. Louis Bruce of the Albany
Inter—racial Center says of ‘Mr.
Granger, "He is one of the finest
workers and lecturers that we have.
He has been active on the labor
front for the past. 15 years. He is it
sincere man. it zealous fighter, and
he possesses a personality that en—
ables him to accomplish his end
without antogonizitrp, other people
involved."

Four Appointed
To SEB Committee

Fottr new members have recently
been added to Student Employment
Bureau Committee. They are Eve-
lyn McGowan, '44; Ruth Blake, '45;
Agnes Young and Ruth Elgie,
freshmen.

Student Employment. Bureau
Committee is a relatively new stu-
dent activity, foundcd in 1938. At
the time of its inception it was de-
cided that it would consist of two
members from each class. Its du-
ties were to act as a go-betwccn
from the student body to SEB. Tire
membership from each class. it was
felt. would make for closer liaison
between the placement bureau and
student opinion.

Since the time of its inception
SEB Committee has greatly en—
larged its activities. It has spon-
sored cdueaiion meetings and
round—tables and supplied the
Bureau with information about jobs
which are open. Forums and dis—
cussions have featured such sub—
jects as “How to Get a Job", “Let-
101‘s of Application" and "Interview
Techniques". They have also
brought speakers to the college.
Perhaps one of its most important
jobs has been the auditing of the
SE13 books.

Paul Bulgcr, Director of SEB,
acts as a member ex officio at corn—
rrriitee meetings. New members are
chosen by the present committee.
The current members, other than
the ones mentioned above include
Owen Bornbrrrd and Lois I‘laflcy,
Seniors, trrrd Patricia Ltriimcr, '44,
and Eleanor Hayeslip, '45.

Alumni Reunion
Set for June 12

More than 6.000 alumni of State

tions for the annual Alumni Day to

cause of wartime conditions, the
program has been shortened and
most of it will be conﬁned to the
Residence Hall Campus.

reunions this year include 1893,
1898, 1903, 1908, 1913, 1918, 1923.

1942. The Half Century Club,
whose members include all those
alumni who have been graduated
for more than fifty years, have been
extended a special invitation by
their president, Dean Annie E.
Pierce. Class councillors have been
keeping in touch with all their
classmates. Each year before
Alumni Day, the councellors write
to all the members of their class.
Their replies are published for the
ofﬁcial Alumni magazine, “The
Alumni Quarterly".

Graduates from as far back as
1875 have in past years attended
Alumni Day and many have been
present who were graduated in the
1880 and 1890 decades.

Student Guides
Organize Under
Hines and Brock

Under the leadership of Ruth
Hines, ’43, and Herbert Brock, ’44,
the student guides for next year are
being organized. Sophomores and
freshmen who wish to act as guides
next year may volunteer by signing
up in the office of Dean of Women.

The name of the group has been
changed from “Junior Guides" to
“Student Guides” because it will
consist of members of all classes,
since few men will be able to re-
turn. The class of ’46 will act as as-
sisiants.

The duties of the guides begin
long before school re—opcns. They
write to their "freshmen sisters"
during the summer, giving them
some information about the college.
Tire first few weeks of school in the
fall. the guides help the freshmen
get acquainted with the college it-
self. conducting them through the
various buildings.

According to a statement by Co—
chairman Miss Hines, bigger and
better ideas for the frosh program
are being planned for next year.
After it is completed selection of
guides will be made and a meeting
will be held at which new ideas and
reforms of past procedures will be
welcomed.

Comprehensive Exams Stopped

The Social Studies comprehensive
examinations, which were given in
previous years, have been discon-
iinucd.

The purpose behind this exami—
nation was to assist Social Studies
majors in choosing for their Junior
and Senior years electives which
would strengthen their weak points.

Since the rigidity of the present
Social Studies program allows for
very few electives or optional sub-
jects, comprehensive examinations
are no longer necessary.

Pies: Bureau
Prepares Report

Press Bureau has been preparing
a report of their year’s activities to
present to Milton G. Nelson, Dean
of the College. Francis Bourgeois,
Director of the Bureau for this year,
has been in charge of the com-
pilation.

The major part of the work of
the Bureau since September has
been in sending notices to the home-
town n ewspapers of students here
at State. These have included news
of enrollment, play casts, class ac-
tivities, dean’s lists, honors. In ad-
dition to this the Bureau has made
arrangements with Gustave Lorey
Photography Studios in Albany
whereby they will submit pictures
of students at the College to the
Times-Union in return for copy
from the Bureau. In this way both
sources attain publicity.

Fair Added Publicity

The State Fair afforded the Press
Bureau a chance for added publicity
for the College. Life magazine was
contacted in an effort to get. a pilo-
tographer here for the event, which
would have been used in the “Life
Goes to ” feature. Unfortun-
ately other plans had been made for
the weekend in question. However,
the affair was pictured in one issue
of the Collegiate Digest, a syndi-
cated service which is distributed
to many colleges throughout the
nation.

The changes in entrance require-
ments and the accelerated program
were stories which were sent over
AP and UP wires throughout the
state. These service not only news-
papers, but also radio. The series
of articles in the NEWS. “Why Re-
main in Teaching," written by
prominent faculty members, was a
Press Bureau project.

Since its inception a few years ago
Press Bureau has been constantly
enlarging its activities. From its
small corner in the Activities Office,
stories of State students go out to
all parts of the state.

The Btrrcau will be guided next
year by Adele Bucci, ’44.
