K . Nora: For those to whom a stake

horse is a meal and not a creature
Jiohose vagaries and moods, when
successfully predicted, mean ill-
g'otten gains, we oﬁer the following
eaglanatirin of out: eigutcheon. t.
ti am» the oat- in one prac r.-
calﬁijr from the nag himself. and
hence symbolizes inside, esoteric m—
;formation of the highest order. And
so—the Oat-Bin.

We' find ourselves in the foulest
predicament that ever befell an em-
bryo sportscaster. It has been hal-
lowed tradition for the sports editor
to criticize the policies of MAA and
its subsidiary, Intramural Council.

A malignant fate plus a tendency
towards a centralization of power
has made the director of this col-
umn’s destinies also the Fuehrer of
MAA. Self—criticism is doubtless
good for the character, but makes
poor sports copy. Greener pastures
must be sought.

A brief statement of policy might
be in order. MAA will put on as
extensive and inclusive a program
as a ﬁfty dollar budget, available
equipment and undetermined per-
sonnel will permit. The policy of
the sports department will be to re-
port, embellish, and interpret the
machinations of this program, and
in general, to give the remaining
reservists, freshmen, and 4F’s a
chance to see their name in print.
The enlarged WAA activities will
be duly presented by our! fair and
capable women’s sports staﬁ.

The remaining portion of today’s
column will be taken over by a
young man who, come Moving—Up
Day next, was to inherit it. Other
more important chores will have
called him by that time. OK, Stan—
give.

By Stan Gipp

Speaking of policies, we have al-
ways found it a bad one to attempt
predictions or even discuss plans in
process. This belief, coupled with
the absence of material of current
interest, leaves only the past as a
subject, but sports and sporting
thrills are always good subjects for
reminiscence.

Campus reunions invariably in—
clude their “bull sessions” in which
the only requirement to gain the
floor is the recollection of an over-
time basket, a successful play or a
wavering putt. When the fellows
who have left this year get together
once more, it won’t be their tales of
overseas adventure but the recol-
lections of the old experiences—the
ones the “gang” remembers that will
inspire these sessions.

There‘ll be talk of Benton’s basket
against St. Lawrence, the upsets of
R. P. I., the first quarter against
Niagara. The “gang” will be talk-
ing of Combs 17 points, Hansen's
delayed shot, Marsland’s tagged-out
visage. They’ll repeat their stories
so often with such enthusiasm that
even the cornered student of the
class of ’53 will remember the exact
details and feel compelled to repeat
them himself—with the proper ad—
ditions.

'l’here'll be tales of intra-mural
trophies, and the rivalry they pro—
voked, of the Frosh-Soph feuds, the
pushball games, the football games,
the "games" under the lights in
Washington Park.

The younger listeners will hear of
the “greats of old", their superior-
ity, individually and as a team, their
invinclbility in comparison to the
class of ’53.

In E. ll) these listeners will learn
that such reminiscence is living in
a world of fantasy. But we’ll enjoy
it. We’ll rehash these old memories
we had together until we can manu-
facture new memories together.

Golf Program Underway

Taking advantage of yesterday’s
clearing skies, Carr Pangburn and
Herb Brock fired the opening shots
of the golf program. The remaining
members of the squad will swing
into action next week. They are:
Ken DuBois, Russ Blythe, Joe Bivl-
ano, Bert Kiley, Stuart Beyerl and
Terry Smyth. Competition will he
on an intramural basis.

Rain Hampers
Softball Program
in l-M League

Last Thursday evening R88 and
EEP groped their way through four
innings to a 2-2 tie. Each team
played with eight men instead of
the regulation ten and neither
showed much in the way of real
softball.

“Meatball” Gerber and Gene
Guarino stood out in defense for
BBS while the only bright spot on
the Potter line-up was Stan Gipp
who banged out two singles for a
perfect day at the plate. At the
end of the fourth it began to sprin-
kle, and before the next inning
could be completed the game was
called, thus nullifying a ﬁve-run
splurge by RBS.

Tuesday evening EEP sloshed
through the muck and mire of Page
Hall field to an easy victory over
the Finks. Welch held the losers
to four hits and three unearned runs
while his teammates ganged up on
Tucker and Olivet for fourteen hits
and twenty-one runs.

Bill Dickson ﬁlled in at third for
his old team. Singer, with four
hits for five times at the plate, was
the big gun in the Potter barrage,
while “Doc” Beyerl pounded out a
double in the ﬁfth inning to furnish
the only scoring punch for the
Finks.

The IM softball league will con-
tinue its losing battle against the
weather next week. Persistent
rains have so hampered the sched-
ule to date that only three games
have been completed.

Softball to Start Today
if Weather Permits

Rain, which has hindered WAA
activities all year, again caused the
postponement of the softball league
games scheduled for Monday and
Wednesday. Mary Now and Doro-
thy Townsend, captains, hope to
start playing oil' the league games
ths afternoon at 3:30 P. M. on
the field in front of Page Hall. This
will not be possible if weather con-
ditions are bad and the ground is
still wet.

Practce for the tournament has
been held regularly in the gymna-
sium. About twenty girls have
come out for each practice period
and it is expected that much more
interest will be shown when play
begins outside.

There is some doubt as to
whether sufficient time will be left
to finish the complete round of
games. Each team entered in the
league may not have an opportun-
ity to play every one of the other
teams. as has been the custom in
previous years. Closest coopera-
tion among the contestants is re-
quired to efficiently use the time
remaining.

Fem Aquatic Course
Successfully Completed

WAA'S swimming season is now
completed. Last Week, 19 of the 25
girls who started the course, passed
the tests. ’I‘hose suceesslul include:
Ilclcn Bushnell, Peggy Dee, Jane
I'ldmunds, Nora Giavelli, Jean Gro-
den, Elaine Grogan, Elaine Harris,
Kit Ilerdrnan, Lucille Kenny, Lore
Kuhn, Gloria Marcantonio, Mary
Now, Phyllis O'Connor, Arline
I’olsky. Mary Seymour, Dot Smith.
iiclcn Stuart, Dot 'l‘ownscnd, and
Edythe Weaver.

’I‘hcse girls are now qualified as
hie-saving instructors, a position
which should prove useful. They
can take jobs as life—guards at
bathing benches and pools this
summer. And, due to the present
rnnn shortage, there will probably
be many such jobs open.

A great deal of enthusiasm was
shown for swimming this year. i’nt
Lathrmr, captain, hopes that next
year will be as suecesslul. Says
l’nlt, "I'l‘ht- fee is small and you learn
a ot.’

STATE COLLEGE news, FRIDAY MAY 14,1943

Margin
far
Error

by Margo Byrne

Well, this issue sees the News'
year out ,and at this point the
women’s sports staff is pretty well
jaded. The gals sit around with
their chins in one hand and a
chawed—ofi pencil in the other and
chant,"

“Win, beat, conquer, down,

“So and so gets done up brown,

“The paper just comes out, and then

“We use the same durned words
again.”

They call us the V-girls because
we know so many synonyms for “to
be victorious over”. Of course, our
own private organization is the J
Js., meaning Jaded Julias. In our
own way we rival Dorcas Societies
and Antivivisection Leagues.

Seriously though, our chief has
done a typical Wurz job. How
could a person upholding the ideals
of the Woman’s League of Voters
be otherwise than honest, indus-
trious and reliable? She has really
recognized the responsibilities of her
position and acted always as she
thought would best benefit women’s
sports at State College. So, in the
name of the Staff, we assure her
that she has left a high standard for
us to aim at next year.

WAA has also made a good record
for the year despite the fact that
weather was again ’em. We heard
a captain unbalanced by a couple of
set-backs, wallowing around the
playing field muttering “Rain last
fall, rain this spring—rain, rain,
rain,” Last fall one of her com-
patriots stood on the tennis courts,
ankle deep in mud and broke her
racquet into tooth picks.

WAA had a particularly good
choice of captains for the individual
sports. Every sport that was offered
drew out a very respectable num-
ber of girls, and the proof of the
effectiveness of WAA is the effect it
has on the student body. Win Jones
deserves credit for starting WAA
Flashes. This is the most significant
contribution WAA has made this
year.

Net Team Seeks Win
On Cortland Courts

State’s tennis squad will journey
to Cortland tomorrow to seek their
first victory. For the past three
years, Cortland has bowed to State’s
rackets and Captain Kensky is con-
fident that this year will be no ex—
ception.

There will be a slight revision in
the line—up, due to Hansen's inabil-
ity to play. Since Hansen h: i been
playing in the number three slot,
his absence will somewhat weaken
the team‘s power.

Rain has thus far hampered prac—
tice, mut the squad had a good
workout last Sunday and is in good
condition for the contest. The fol-
lowing men will make the trip,
playing in the order named: Harry
Kensky, Jim Miner, Bob F’erber,
Dick Chillemi, George Erbstein and
ltoy Rand.

NOTHING ELSE SO GOOD

IS SO GOOD FOR YOU

 

 

 

Sports, Food (Bring Your Own),

Will Highlight WAA Ploy Day

Every day, in every way,

Girls grow towards WAA.

What the heck can you expect, when
Uncle Sam has priority on men?

Last fall, when MAA was a power
on this campus (remember when
State was a co—ed college?). A
joint play-day was held with WAA.
Those days are gone forever (sigh)
for war has eliminated the attrac-
tion (?)—or distraction of the
ERC’s. The women, however, will
bravely carry on (though not in the
same manner as other years) by
holding their annual playday tomor—
row, May Leda LaSalle, in
charge of the festivities, predicts
that “With the fine cooperation and
the interest shown, the day promises
to be one of the greatest in WAA’s
history—weather permitting (but it
probably won’t).”

A varied program, featuring soft-
ball rivalry among the four classes
has been arranged. The girls of ’45,
unbeaten in softball, challenge all
comers (nothing like getting some
good hard feelings in here)——oh,
well, Albany’s climate never did
agree with us anyway. If softball
doesn't appeal there will also be
archery, volley ball, badminton or
any other outdoor sport in which
the girls wish to participate.

by Joan Hylind

 

The fun begins at two o’clock on
the ﬁeld behind the Dorm. Those
in charge, expecting that, once the
girls get there they won’t want to
leave, extend this cordial(?) invita-
tion, “Stay for supper—you bring

the food.” (The CPA is so stingy
with those little blue and red
stamps.)

If it’s fun, entertainment and com-
panionship that you’re looking' for
(and who isn’t) come around to-
morrow. Give your corpuscles a
work-out, dust ofi’ those muscles
—oh, yes, you have them—(maybe
you don't believe us now but you
will Sunday). But cheer up so
what if you can’t move the next
day—Sunday is a day of rest.

Girls Hike Tuesday

For four weeks in succession
hikes planned by Leah Tischler
have been canceled by inclement
weather. But, “Come what may,”
says Tischler, “there will be a hike
this coming Tuesday.” So all those
hardened souls who enjoy walking,
rais or shine, show up at 3:30 P. M.
by the girls locker room in Lower
Draper.

As a starter a walk in the park is
scheduled, with a longer jaunt, per-
haps from the end of the bus-line
to Indian Ladder, to come later.
