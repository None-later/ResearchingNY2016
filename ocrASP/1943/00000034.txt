In the past the News has been
instrumental in campaigning for
reforms and alterations in the con-

The Critic.—

by Cooper
Eyes blurred perhaps with mem-
ories, searching the halls for fa-
Iniliar faces. they were looking for
something . . . something that was
missing. They were looking for a
year that had passed.

lIc‘s darling cro‘HIumrd.’

He, too, must feel that things
would be okch if only he could
catch aliold of something tangible.
Something like the green bound
volume that humbly reads “To the
men of State—those now with us
and those who used to be—~we dedi-
cate this book.”

The ’43 Fed is not sophisticated

Icessary contrast. the photos present

There's lcss patter, and more pic-
tures. What printed matter there
is, is natural and varied. One can
read it effortlessly. There is none

The print and titles are plain and
clean-cut. easily read. The cap-
tions under the pics are tricky. and

The distribution of material is se-
lect. From page to page, the Fed

Ped is kaleidoscopic.

For once. the pies look like
the people.

Bouquets go to Trace and her
staff for “what they did with what
they had." for turning out a com-
pact, weli-balanced issue.

what the first year is.

THE MUTABILITY OF THINGS

It’s not just the violent shade of green on the PO. walls nor the
fact that a certain fraternity house is now misleadingly called Sayles
Hall Annex. Nor is it the absence of familiar faces on the faculty and
oh so Inain freshman girls . . . Btit they represent the real changes —
another year under increasingly difficult conditions and the proving
ground of a new feminine regime under Princess Pat.

We find that about 10% of State's glamour and at least 4 "t of its
activity has “flew the coop" in the person of Mary Studebaker, who is
moving to Maryland and who plans to attend college there. WL would
like to toss Ii well-deserved orchid to this bclIind-tlIe-scencs lady. one
time contender for the Crown. “Studic,” in her own cyclonic way. has
figured prominently in dramatic class, war and student activities. Ver-
satility and beauty all in one armi‘ul
