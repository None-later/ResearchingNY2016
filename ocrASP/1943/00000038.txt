Philanthropy

A six-year old, dreaming, dream-
ing, “I’d eat ice cream and suckers
all day and buy a live goat," then
listening enthusiastically to an
equally dreamy companion making
plans for the million dollars that
hung suspended from some tall
green tree . . . wasn't that you? Or
an adolescent, thumbing through the
dictionary to find the correct four
syllables, finally announceing, “I’d
help humanity; were I rich, I’d be
a phil-an-thropist!” . . . . wasn‘t that
also you?

Humanity then had a vague mean-
ing. Perhaps it meant everybody
who needed help, perhaps those
afflicted with cancer or tuberculosis;
perhaps it just meant people with
whom we weren’t acquainted. But
"rich" and “philanthropist” were
clear in our mind and Were truly
delightful words. Rich—a hundred
million dollars!

Quite suddenly a war of nations
made us rich. The dollars never did
tumble from the dream-tree, and we
forgot the goat. But we became ricn
while hate battles were fought, rich
enough to keep our adolescent
promises of philanthrODY. rich
enough to serve and save humanity,
rich enough to give away our wealth
and never miss it.

We have blood to donate.

We’re a iittel frightened when we
think about defining humanity now,
especially when blood and war must
somewhere be worded into a current
defiinltion. War and blood and peo-
ple we know, people who are in need.
in pain. The Armed Forces overseas.
the men to replace men, the men
soon to be sent, over to increase the
Forces—they are humanity and must
be served and saved.

And we have blood to donate; that
will save more of our fighting nun
than we can count. We can give
something that we will never miss
and proudly call ourselves philan-
thropists.

Last year, fewer than one hundred
State students signed up for this
service. Twelve per cent of the stu-
dent body made trips to the Blood
Bank, while the rest hoarded their
wealth.

This year, the call for donors is
even more urgent, for the year is a
more crucial one. To us, the call
is more urgent, for more of our

lt'l'l its view.

Editorial

At 11:00 in the Auditorium this
morning, you will witness a prelude
to the evening's events of Activities
Day.

It is customary for the Activities
Day Program to reach its pinacle at
the Bonfire in the evening when the
four classes join together in singing
the traditional songs of the Alma
Mater, shouting the school cheers
and watching the entertainment. The
underlying surge of enthusiasm and
sentiment on this day is probably
second only to that of Moving-up
Day.

In recent years. there has been a
lag in school spirit. We students
have chosen to take the easy way.
We have pursued a course of passive-
ness, which when practiced too much
can become harmful, for passiveness
leads to disinterest.

In spite of the ratio, the men of
State have always been the ones with
the most spirit in the college. They,
unlike the women, have usually been
able to maintain their enthusiasm
all through their four years.

This year, it is up to us students
to compensate doubly, both for the
absent man and for ourselves. It is
up to us to participate actively in
all college affairs. It is up to us, not
only to bring alive the spirit that
was a part of the men, but to do it
tenfold.

With the pep rally this morning in
Assembly, Student Council is hoping
to stimulate the students to action.
If we give our complete backing,
it is not unlikely that Activities Day
will be one of our first important
moves in rehabilitating and reani-
mating the attitude of the student
body as a whole.

If tomorrow night sees a healthy
display of student interest of invigor-
ating and sincere school spirit, we
will know that we are beginning to
accomplish our task~that of making
State the College our men will want
to return to.

 

The [Big Ten,

The idea of the “Big Ten." origin—
ated by Myskanla and Student
Council offers a soluton to at least
one of the problems concerning the
"different state of affairs" at College
this year. That problem, which ap-
peared to be worrying so many peo-
ple last spring when the men of thc

 

friends and family members have
been sent to battle. _

With a larger student body, thcj
College can and must multiply thc'
number of donors by at least five.
Anyone who is eighteen or over and
who weighs at least 110 pounds has
the opportunity to sign up tomorrow
to donate blood. The War Council
Office in the Commons will furnishl
blanks.

This phase of Activities Day makes
it an all-college affair, not merely
one to accommodate freshmen and
transfer students. And “try-outs”
will be arranged for each registrant's
convenience. A

We can consider tomorrow War“
Activtiles—Philanthropy Day.

 

College began leaving, was just what
was going to become of Statc's social
life. The dances, Jimior wcckcnd
and fraternity functions seemed to
be fading into the distance.

Now, at one stroke, a solution
which can give the students their
social life and also it part in the war
effort is offered.

Perhaps the best part of the plan
is that it at last utilizes the effort
given so freely in the preparation
of Proms and Soirces something de-
finite Iind worthy as a goal. Instead
of sporadic efforts at doing some-
thing to help, State College has
before it a plan that will insure a
definite contribution to the war

 

Communications

To the Editor:

I am not what is known as a
drinking woman but I do like a re~
freshing drink of coke between
classes. It is my only vice and I
consider it a mild one. Therefore it
irks me considerably after drinking
milk for breakfast and eating it
with my lunch to find that I am
forced to drink some more milk by
the kindergarten expedient of tak-
ing the coke machine out. After
all if I am old enough to come to
college I am old enough to decide
whether or not I can have a. coke.
Every day I run two more inches off
my legs going to the store for a
bottle of coke.

Well, what are they going to do
about it?

Cokie-less Cookie.

 

To the Editor:

What has happened to the Alumni
Residence Halls?

First of all, the room and board
has been raised to $360, an increase
of $40 a year. What is there to show
for this increase? The food is worse
than it ever has been, in spite of the
fact that there is more money to
spend. We realize that food prices
have risen considerably in the past
year, but the meals served in the
dorms are not worth the 70c per
plate they are supposed to be worth.
And a constant diet of starch isn’t
considered essential for good health.
Since the ration books have been
taken away from the inmates of the
houses. it is now even impossible for
them to buy decent food to prepare
themselves.

Next on the list is the question of
heat. Last year we were promised
that we would get more heat after
the conversion from oil to coal had
been completed. That change has
been made, and we are still trying to
find the warm rooms in the dorm.
Why?

Lastly—the condition of the Greek
Theatre and the terraces between
Sayles and Pierce Halls. Both figure
prominently in college activities, and
their upkeep is an essential. At
present they are covered with long

 

grass and weeds. If the dorm field
can be kept in good condition, surely
it would require little effort to care
for the rest of the grounds.

We fully realize that gripes are
cheap these days, but we think that
these are problems about which
something can be done. How about
it, Alumni Association?

An Interested Inmate.

effort. If the proposed plans go off
as scheduled, and interest does not
wane before the completion of the
program, State College will be able
to sit back and consider a job well
done.

The plan to include all organiza-
tions should give every student in
the College an opportunity to do his
part. Even those not doing any
extra-curricular work may be drawn
in on the presentation to be given
by the group houses. This plan can
become a truly ALL-STATE project.

INDICTMENT OF STATE COLLEGE

In this year's Pod there appears two pages with pretty pictures ironically
captioned, “We are proud to present . . . ” describing State’s war effort.
It certainly needed no more than two pages. It seemed singularly apropos
that the same people should appear over and over in the photographs
since it is only a small group that takes any rabid interest in the war

unusual course of reading editorials

New Deal circles. The President, in

that the editorials bitterly condemn-
