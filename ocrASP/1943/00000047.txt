Where There’s Life . ..

Today we‘re not going to dwell on the factor that
two-thirds of the student body failed to sign up for
War Activities. We shall dismiss it by saying
that State's servicemen tnust be quite proud of
their Alma Mater, and undoubtedly their hearts
will skip a few beats in appreciation of this fine
cooperation on the “College front."

We're not pleading on bended knee to the ()6
and 2/3 per cent to redeem themselves. Oh no,
this is a democracy, isn't it, where the individuals do
what they deem fit. It's not tip to its to tell them
whether or not they should sit in the stamp booth,
whether or not they should take a little time out
for rolling bandages, whether or not they can make
a mere poster. it’s an altogether different voice
from ours that does the dictating.

But at this time, we can present a completely
new war activity to the student body~--»to do with
it, not necessarily what IS fitting, but as THEY
see fit. Perhaps we're sailing around in a cloud
of optimism by taking the time to explain it here,
but we are still living under the assumption that
where there's life, there’s hope.

War Council has a job ahead of them this year
which not only is a highly important one, but
which is an extremely Significant one as well. War
Council has solicited Forum’s and the entire student
body’s assistance in carrying out the task of keep-
ing in constant contact with every single State
College man anti woman in the armed forces.

There are two purposes behind this: the first
is that the files will be tip to date, by recording
the address, or change of address, of every "soldier."
This can be achieved through individual correspon-
dence, which immediately leads to the second or
underlying aim making sure that every person iii
the armed forces frotn State receives letters. Letter-
writing is one of the tnost effective means there is
of boosting morale. A statnp on a letter to camp
produces results that can hardly be attributed to
the three cent trialling cost.

Forum will undertake this project by asking every
student iii the college to sign up to write to one
soldier, keeping consistently iii touch with liitti. This
will be done systematically. Students will not
write to soldiers of their own choosing. Rather,
the names on the student volunteer list will be
stacked against thc “soldier list" of lit'. join-s,
names arid addresses tht-t‘cfort- itcing allottcd i‘l‘\~
pct tivcly.

'i‘iic difficulties iti itccping thc soldicr and \lili'h‘
flies to date will thus be sotticwliat eliminated.
More litt‘liritty ill rctords is cxpct tcd. to say noth-
ing of tlic ttioralc attglc.

Forum will lautttli this program within the ill.‘.\'l
two weeks, centralizing tlic l'ilit‘i rt-sponsibiiitics
with ten students (incidentally in the Hi bracket).

Perhaps this shouldn’t be tailed a war activity
since figures show that the majority of students are
allergic to the Word. iiut where there’s iifc there’s
hope.

STATE COLLEGE NEWS, FRIDAY, OCTOBER 19, 1943

Drizzle: and Fizzles

 

If critics must stand fifteen min-
utes in the rain, get drenched, and
sit shivering for an hour and a
half in the back of the auditorium,
then the least that can be done is
to make their time well spent. The
very least.

There were some few good things
to be said for the Tuesday night
plays. Fred Wolensky who played the
piano in intermission was wonder-
ful. He's a professional. Let's have
more of him. Otherwise your critic
has a jaundiced eye about the whole
proceedings.

Let’s take the first play. It. is
said, by those who should know,
that this play has always been well
received by the State College aud-
ience. What happened to it then?
It was, I take it, supposed to be
funny. Hah, hah. It turned out
slightly on the pathetic side. But,
lest we be entirely acidic, there are
some few things to be said for it.
Martha Joyce as the Irish cook. turn-
ed in a fine workmanlike job and
brought a strange air of reality to
what otherwise looked like nothing
more than some State College stu-
dents done up in fancy clothes.
wandering ill at at case about the
stage. Clyde Cook had a good Eng-
lish accent. we almost forgot to say,
and since this is his first appear-
ance on the Page Hall stage, can be
forgiven a certain stiffness. Other—
wise ’twas sad, 'twas sad.

by Ryan

 

The second play was much the
better. When Aney steps on a stage,
there always comes a miraculous
breath of real theatre. But, and it
pains us to mention it, but as a
critic we must, even Aney stumbled
on some lines. But she shall be for-
given, because who wouldn't stumble
when those pictures on the wall
kept tumbling down in mad con-
fusion? Nail ’em on next time,
stagecraft. Elaine Drooz, the di-
rector, should be congratulated for
keeping up a swift pace in dialogue.
Ancy, most of all, should be con-
gratulated for another one of her
always outstanding performances.
We forgot how Wet and miserable we
were, watching her in those tantrum
scenes and envying her complete
command of nuance and inflection.
Thank you, Aney—for being Aney.
At times Fred Fancher delivered his
lines with all the firm conviction of
Adolf Hitler congratulating Winston
Churchill on recent Allied successes.

His accont didn’t remain very
stable either. But the boy has a
voice, a stage presence that may
develop, and a sense of satiric deli-
very. There was some very beau-
tiful timing iii the dialogue and some
expert ad—libbing when the phone
didn’t ring.

Dr. Hardy did a “brilliant bit" as
the off-stage voice of Briggs, the
butler. Watch that boy!

By RHONA RYAN

Let's talk about Westbrook Pegler
this week! Now here we have a
character. He gets as apoplectic as
that Burton Wheeler about the ad-
ministration, labor, the conduct of
the war, and all other such things.
but still you have to have a certain
respect for the man.

Pegler hates two people most of
all in all the world. Mrs. Roosevelt
and Harold Ickes. He hates them
with a fine unreasoning fury. It's
fun to watch him get started on an
“Eleanor” column. He begins in
what you might call modulated
tones. Then. the more he writes the
more his blood—pressure rises, and
at the end he's practically screaming
over his typewriter. The man’s a
three-ring circus.

Of course, he’s an arch conserva-
tive. He's the bulwark of Wall
Street, and all the well-vested busi-
ness men, and you can just see them
hastily ripping open their papers to
see what he’s said last about Roose-
velt, or labor. Pegler is an almost
pitiful remnant of the type of red-
‘oaiter that garnished this fair land
in the 20's. To him, anyone who
tried something new, or feels we
might have some advantageous
changes in our government, is dis-
tinctly a saboteur, traitor, and
criminal of sorts. That sort of un-
reasoning dislike of the new and
the untried might be a danger in
the post-war world.

Now you’ve got to respect the man
for the obvious sincerity, don’t get

me wrong. It just strikes me as a
pity that he spends all his time in-
vestigating the past crimes and past
misdeeds of a few favorite public
figures, and labor unions, instead of
once in a while giving some con-
structive thought to future problems.

For instance, to Pegler, labor is
the anethema of anethemas. He goes
purple at the very thought of ti
union. He investigates with glee
any of the more notorious racketeer-
ing unions. True, there are some
bad operators among the unions.
But what of the 95% of American
labor unions that have struggled
along to get better wages land just
talk to one of the old taxi-drivers
in Albany who wasn’t paid a living
wage ’till he organized, and you'll
realize the virtue of unionS), decent
working conditions, and fair labor
practices for their members? It
doesn't seem to be the same attitude
of mind, that constant heckling of
labor because of some of its unde-
niable faults, while completely ignor-
ing some of its just as obvious vir-
tues. To me. anyhow. it doesn't
seem the frame of mind in which
one should judge important ques-
tions.

So we’ll leave Peglcr. If you don't
read his column, I recommend it to
you. He's a reporter, and a good
one. Deserves that Pulitzer Prize
he won. But. also, if you're even
faintly liberal, it will do you some
good to get good and mad at him.
Try it.

 

Lament to Summaries and Spirit—

’I‘o the Editor:

I am one of the students in this
College who find it difficult to do
all the things which are demanded
of me. I have designs on Myskania,
the girls need me oti WAA, I have
spent every noon hour looking
through my mailbox for notes, I
walk all the way over from Farrell
Mansion cvci'y morning. I wish for
dates and enjoy the 'l‘ucsday night
limits. I got classes too. By Satur—
day l'in just too exhausted to work.
But just, for a llllllllit' l cart take
time to rcad War Fronts.

I, too, may sacrifici- Myskanin.
Wcll. maybe the girls don’t ttccti titt-
on WAA, my mail is dropping off
now, I‘m planning on moving nctircr
lht- school. and of dates anti lllt'
’l'ut-stiav night play, i do not speak.

Wltat docs this leave? (iltli’l‘lH.
iicc War Fronts in my biascd opin-
ion, this coltitiitt is invaluable to
students who wish to get their chk-
ly dose of llt‘Wfi its painlcssly as
possible. While the style oi lilt‘
writer would do credit to llot'olhy
'l'lioitipson. I find that the content
does not. always follow out the prom-
fat: of tin: titic, iiurtoii K. Wilm'ltll'
is an interesting personality but
that week I missed hearing of
Allied gains or 10555125. I don't to-
member now which,

I find it impossible to ptit in as
tnuch time reading this column as
the space it consumes requires. I
could follow precedent and content
myself with ignoring it as I do the
omission of my mime on Dean‘s List,
but Ryan deserves a better break
than that.

To you, Ryan, I'm sorry, but let's
have more opinion on Will" fronts.

Resigned
Dear Editor,

I tltiitk yott wasted a lot of Vill-
uubic titttc mid space when you
printed lhosc editorials about school
spirit. As far as l Ciill see, the only
result. was swt-ilcd hetids. Everybody
thought titat illt‘ year was off to a
good start so tin-re was no ticcd oi
knocking himself otit to do things

Of course. llli‘l't‘ arc the cxccp—
tiotiai few who do things and go
places. itivm'y year it is the same
olti story, soint- three hundred stu-~
tictits attend all tltc pluys, btty all
Ihc tickets, sign up for War Acthi-
tics Council, go to all the iticctntgs
and. in general, keep the school on
its feet. What’s the matter With
the other five or six hundred? Arc
they dead and don't know it?

it would be nice to sec some new
faces at the Ail-State Hpcciai. After
all, the age of mirucics hasn't puss—
ted- they say.

Spirited Sally.

MEMORIAL

We would like to congratulate John Gardephe, ’41
He is the first soldier that we ever heard of who
had ten dollars that he didn’t know what to do with.
It arrived at the P0. at an opportune time, when the
ans Board was considering the question of rejecting
their part of the curtain appropriation. The curtains
are on their way—the John Gardephe Memorial Cur-
tains. If it weren’t for the late lamented decree that
no loungers Were to be allowed in the News office, the
P0. might have been renamed the John Gardephe
Memorial Lounge.

OVER THE FENCE

The Seniors, it seems, think that being a
Senior is a full-time job. Anyhow. they were scarce
as hen's teeth when registration day for War Activities
came . . . Forum is talking about writing letters to
State soldiers. That personal touch from the ferns
. . . There have been letters from the student body
asking about the coke machine. Just to make things
complicated why can't the coke machine be put
in the Commons.

on campus claniored for her. Her climb to fame was
inevitable.

During her freshmen and sophomore years she Wits
liked and admired by everyone. Itt her Juiiior ycar,
hchver, things began to change. Ugly little rumors
floated around. It was taken for granted that she
would make Myskania. Sonic whispered that sorority

STATE COLLEGE NEWS, FRIDAY, OCTOBER

College’s Ratio-Conscious DAFs Forum Organizes
"lo See Reorganization This Year Letter-jﬂting

The ‘T ‘n’ T," the "TGIF's," the
Maladjusteds -— and now the
“DAF’s!” Never let it be said that
the Roosevelt administration has
a monopoly on the alphabet! State
College (as in everything else) is
right in the thick of it. During the
past few years. clubs and societies
have sprung up over-night—and
died down . . . but the DAF’s live oni

This year. State women welcome
the reorganization of the “DAF's"—
“Dates Aren’t Fashionable” Club—a
group that was first organized last
year with ten charter members. If
one can roll bandages, write letters
to service men. or wangle her way
into the USO, she will be a prized
and honored candidate for the
DAF's. The very small allotment
of two hours per week—~Saturday
night, preferably—at one of these
tasks is sufficient to make a woman
an official and proud member of
this great, if small, organization!

The DAF's pride themselves on
their hardy, hearty patriotism. With
love of country burning fiercely in
their hearts, they gallantly shake
their heads and murmur “No” to
the throng of men clustered at their
doors clamoring for a date on Sat—
urday night!

And now, a word or two of ex-
planation about those other old and
honored institutions in State . . . .

The “T 'n‘ T”wTucsday and
Thursday Club~boasted as its inciti—
bers State Juniors who met after
the Tuesday and Thursday 8:10 A.M.
Methods classes. The students met
in the “Boul,” gathered in a huddle,
and scribbled news bulletins to ser-
vice men.

An what of the "TGIF's?" What.
are they—who are they? Last year,
a group of high-spirited Statcrs met

every Friday afternoon in an atmos-
phere of geniality and good-fellow-
ship. Why? We—ll, for the purpose
of holding—shall we say—~secret bull
sessions? See a former member for
full particulars!

Did people really join a “Mal-
adjusted Club? Yes, my doors, peo-
ple did! After the personality quizzes
were given in Junior Ed. 10 last year
the poor unfortunates receiving a
score of definite moi-adjustment
banded together for company . . .

Now, back to the DAF’s — How‘s
your patriotism. Wotncn of State?
Are you game? A good representa-
tion of last year’s PO loungers made
an enthusiastic appearance at the
organization's meetings and may be
“drafted” again this year.

How about starting now? This
week's work will undoubtedly tux
your time and patience. All enrolled
DAF’s have pledged themselves
to go to the “All-State Special" to-
morrow night tot/hon! on ('sr'orl.’
tAh. me! What a sacrifice! What
one will ttot give tip for one's
country!)

Well, there's the story in a nut-
shell. .ioin up now! Your country
needs you! (By the way. it's it won-
derful face-saver oti Saturday
nights . . . .

Photo Exlbii Scheduled

Pictures for the photo exhibit
on the second floor of Draper, sched-
uled for December 6 to December
16, should be placed in the box op—
posite the P0, or given to Leah
’l‘ischler, '45, or Mary Stengcl. ‘44,
before Nov. 20. Pictures may be on
any subject and must be 2 x 3, or
tirgcr.

New System increases

Soldiers’ Address File

By next Friday. Forum expects to
have specific organized plans for get-
ting every studcnt in the College
writing to a State man or woman in
the service. Backed by War Council,
Forum hopes to secure student-wide
participation in this new war activ-

There are two reasons dominating
this action on the part of Forum and
War Council. Both organizations
state that if each student, through
letter-writing, can keep in touch with
and record the change of address of
one serviceman' Dr. Jones’ file and
the News file will automatically be
kept current. Writing letters will
simultaneously play a part in mor-
ale.

Forum will post a large list in
lower Draper next week where stu-
dents may sign to write to a soldier.
Soidlcrs' names and addresses will be
handed out alphabetically. Students
will receive names according to the
order in which they have volunteer-
ed.

A committee of ten. to be appoint-
ed by this afternoon. will be res-
ponsible for efficiency, accurary,
and breadth of scope in maintaining
this activity.

Dr. Harvey Rice. Professor of So-
cial Studies who is faculty repre-
sentatch 011 War Council as well as
being faculty adviser to Forum,
states, "This is a tremendous task
which we have before us. But if
000 to 800 names of service men and
women are divided among the stu-
dent. body, not only is the work in-
dividualized, but the necessary con-
centration is minimized."

Girls to Masquerade, Parade-
ln Yearly Hollowe’en Escapade

It is very likely that any queer
sight roaming the streets tomorrow
night is a by-product of the wild
schemes planned by Sayles and
Pierce Halls.

Both dorms will celebrate the oc-
casion by dinner parties on Saturday
night. Not letting the All-State
Special stop them, Saylcs Hall will
begin with a masquerade banquet
at 5:30. followed up with skits, games
and refreshments in the gym. Dor-
lene Moshak and Elaine Uffman‘
freshmen, are in charge, which
should give the lowly class a chance
to show their much-talkcd-about
talent and spirit.

Pierce, too, will start with a din-
ner. and frotn Jane Rooth. ’45, chair-

Teacher Shortage
NotedSurvey

The nation‘s shortage of teachers
is estimated at 75.000, according to
a survey of the National Education
Association. The group held its
twenty-third annual meeting last
month in New York City, at which
time the problem was discussed and
statistics were presented.

Science and mathematics teachers
rank among the first on the list of
shortages, partly because many of
these educators have found impor-
tant and higher paying positions in
defense industries and partly because
these courses are taught, in the
main. by men who have been in-
ducted into the Armed Forces.

Dr. Alonzo M. Meyers. Chairman
oi the Department of Higher Edu—
catloti of New York University, gave
statistics to show about one-fifth
of the nation's 30,000,000 school chil-
dren returned to new teachers in
September. These new teachers
number 250,000. of whom more titan
100,000 have sub-standard qualifica-
tions. They received etnployment
oiily because of the shortage of
teachers.

The Assistant Director of the
National Education Association's
research staff. Dr. Ivan A. Booker,
estimated that one of every five
male teachers has left his work
since Pearl Harbor, while thousands
of educators left their school work
to take higher paying war jobs.

An appeal is made to teachers
who have left their positions who
are not employed in essential indus—
tries to return to their former work.
Students in teacher training institu-
tions are included in the appeal to
fill the shortage of qualified educa-

one will be incognito, and the tables
will be decorated in keeping with
the day.

Corn stalks, pumpkins, barrels of
cider, and popcorn will be the
background for the grand march
and the stunts in the Ingle.
Each cottage is planning a stunt,
and various groups in the dorm will
perform. Western Hall, with its
traditional “wild bunch," promises
some hair raising escapades, even
suns Serabian.

This is the chance the girls have
been waiting for, that of dressing
as they please (as if they don’t).
Original get-ups in winter flannels
and curlers are anticipated, but one
never knows. Some ingenious or in-
genuous female might win the
freak prize by coming minus her
make-up.

Departmental Clubs
Plan New Program

The Departmental Clubs have
opened the season’s activities with
full programs including discussions,
games, folk songs and practical pro-
jccts.

The programs of French Club for
the year will feature music, dis-
cussions and refreshments.

Last night, Dr. Mary Goggin, In-
structor in Latin and Dr. C. C. Smith,
Professor of Education, led Classical

be Dropped from the College Curri-
culum?"

At it meant ineetliig of the Pan
Atiiigos, Dr. James W. Chllders, Pro-
fessor of Spanish, presented films
taken on a recent trip to Mexico.
Also, iii connection with the “Good
Neighbor Policy," the Pan Amigos
are now corresponding with college
students in Mexico, South America
and Cuba. Future plans of this or-
ganization include the presentation
of a Spaniin film for the benefit
of War Council.

The slide-rule was the main topic
of discussion at the last meeting of
Math Club. Ethel Heterllne, ’44,
explained the uses and operation of
this apparatus to the organization.
