Bert Kiley

Don’t be surprised if we digress
from. sports occasionally, children.

The following is a bit of semantics
on a word that there seems to be
some confusion about.

Amendment: In parliamentary or
legislative procedure, any alteration
made or proposed to be made in a
bill, motion, or constitution, or
clause thereof, by adding, changing,
substituting, or omitting.

New Student Service

Those two lovable old characters,
Wurtz and Kiley have inaugurated
a new service for students.

Entitled “Kiss of Death, Inc.” this
organization offers its unselfish ser-
vices to any group or individual who
needs it—for a price.

It’s purpose is to see that legisla-
tion, appropriations, etc., is passed,
tabled, killed or whatever fate the
client wishes for it.

Perhaps a simple illustration
would aid in helping the lay mind
grasp the intricacies, ideals and price
scales (mercenary brutes, aren’t
they?) of K of D. Inc.

Let us take a hypothetical bill to
appropriate a hundred dollars for
murals for the faculty washroom.
Since the students love their faculty
deeply, and realize the need for the
Building Beautiful, this bill would
slide through that good time Charlie,
the Student Association, on ball
bearings.

Enter K of D

Just to make sure that it goes
through, the bill's sponsors may con-
tact K of D, Inc. This bill probably
would not require more than one
speech condemning it and the charge
would be the base rate of one dollar.

Should there exist, hOWever, people
so base as to wish this appropriation
defeated, K of D would cheerfully
go to bat for it—for a larger fee.

To defeat such a public spirited
measure, both members of the firm
would probably have to speak at
least once. Two speakers (Iii $1.00
equals $2.00.

In fact, they might have to speak
in its praise more than once. There
is a charge of fifty cents each for
every speech over the initial declam-
atlon.

Since two orators have their hand
on the public pulse as well as in
the public pocket, they might sense
a need for more stringent action.
An amendment might be necessary.
Amendments are seventy-five cents
a rip. Tabling is fifty cents.

The firm operates on a money
back guarantee. If its efforts fail
to produce the promised result, the
expended effort is on the house and
the statesmen will subsist on grilled
frankfurters for another week.

Hansen Sparks

GI Combination
To Cow in

The GI. Gherks eked out a 37-35
victory over the State All-Stars last
Tuesday on the Page Hall floor. The
game went to two overtime periods.

Leading the GI attacks with 19
points, Frank “Rizley” Hansen was
more of a one-man team than he
was on last year’s varsity. It was
Hansen’s drive and heads-up play
in the last half that enabled the
GI outfit to overcome a 21-7 half-
time deficit.

With Cote stealing the initial tap
and dribbling in for the first count-
er, the All-Stars took a lead which
they did not relinquish until Han-
sen's pop knotted the count at 31-2111
with seconds to go.

Abandon Zone

The GI set up a zone defense at
the outset which the Stars found
full of holes. Pops by Hammond and
under the basket scoring by Tabner
and Kiley ran the count to 10-1 at
the quarter and 21-7 at theh alf.

With the start of the second half,
the Gherks abandoned the zone in
favor of a shifting man-to-man and
began pressing the Stars in the back-
court. This maneuver throttlcd the
Stars' attack so thoroughly that they
scored but ten points the second half.

With Reed and Hansen intercep-
ting the early season spotty passing
of the Stars, the Gherks closed the
gap point by point with pops and
following-up. The GI’s controlled
the ball the second half.

In the first three minutes over-
time a Hansen field matched foul
points by Dickinson and Kiley. In
the second epilogue, Terry Smythe’s
lay-up was the deciding marker after
both teams had scored fields.

with bated breath awaiting the
outcome of the “battle of the
Century.“ The!) tragedy struck,
there was the sound of rcnding

middle of a smashing drive. it
definitely piiincd expression
spread over her features. An
uncxpcndablc article of clothing
had expended! A reporter,
covering the game for the S’I‘A'l‘li

her stricken comrade with a
safety pill.

The match continued but Gar-
fail did not do her best. Not
only did she lose the match and
the championship but she ripped

Tourney Completion Doubtlul

As the WAA Tennis 'l‘ournamcnt
goes into its final stages. there
is doubt as to whether all the
matches will be played off. The
courts are scheduled to close over
the wcck-cnd and many matches
are still unplaycd,

Skidmore-State
ln Hockey Clash

WAA Council contacted Skidmorc,
Russell Sage, and Emma Willard,
inviting them to participate in a
hockey game with the State eleven.
As yet, Skidmorc alone has replied
in the affirmative. The game will
take place tomorrow at 3:00 on the
Dorm Field.

At prcscnt. the line-up is as fol-
lows: Goalie—Garfall, with Burzak
as alternate; F‘ullbacks—Bohcn and
Sanderson. with Davidson and Ver-
noy as alternates; Halfbacks—Now.
LaSailc. and Margot. Townsend al-
ternating; Wings—Malloy and Mas-
trangclo, with Hcrdman alternating;
lnncrsmShoup. Duffy. and Baker
as alternate; Ccntcr~Slack, with
McCormick alternating.

Mary Now will captain the team.
She should prove very capable in
this position. due to the refresher
roursc she had at “The Hockey
Camp," this past summer. Mary
will undoubtedly make use of the
new techniques she learned there,
so the game will most likely have
some novel twists.

The contest tomorrow should prove
to be of mllch intcrcst to all sports
fans at Stalc. and to hockcy cnihu-
slusls in particular.

Margo Byrne

The cold, gray, gloomy Fall has
descended on Albany to dampen the
playing fields, tennis courts and
consequently, our spirits. The usual
autumnal notices of postponed games
sprinkle the sports page and we sit
chewing our last pre-war eraser.

Insecurity is the lot of the sports-
writer in this climate when that
ghastly limbo between fall and win-
ter rolls around, with its frequent
promise of fine weather, which,
incidently, never maicrializes to the
point where definite action in the
field of sports is possible.

Never [)0 Today

On all sides we are met with as-
surances that games will be played
positively tomorrow—always tomor-
row. But ‘tomorrow’ we find that
the tennis courts are bogs and the
hockey field is knee-deep in mud.

Coupled with epidemic mid~semcs~
tcr blues, the sports reporter is
forced. in addition, to cope with
frustration. We are filled with self-
pily which is exemplified by the
fact that barely fifty percent of the
stuff make Dean's List, despite our
mighty intellects.

Conditions are in such a state
that even a nasty swipe at W.A.A.'s
tennis tournament would not soothe
our depression, so we will refrain
from using such good material until
such time that we ourselves relish
our own efforts.

Meanderings [lave Motive

At any rate. in looking over the
files of the News, we have found
that the only sports columns which
we read With avid interest were
those dealing with sundry topics far
removed from the drudgery of sports
writing. Obviously a flight of fancy
such as we are indulging in, is nec-
essary periodically as a safety valve.

Our immediate predecessor stated
quite truthfully that few parts of a
newspaper can be written with re-
gard for literary merit. And sports
writing is peculiarly stylized, Every—
one recognizes and usually dislikes
the accustomed jargon. Perhaps
any attempt at what is commonly
known around this institution as
‘crcatlvc writing,’ is one step away
from standardization. John Kicran
has deviatch from the formula and
we shall make an effort to emulate
him.

So, forgch us our digl'cssions oc-
casionally. Ii, nmuscs us and in
them we try to amuse you. It's all
in the llilLlll‘i‘ of an attempt to escape
this sicrcolypcd.
