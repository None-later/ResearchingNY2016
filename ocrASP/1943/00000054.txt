Chest Drive Sets
$500 For Goal

Charity Campaign Plans
To Break '42 Record

The third annual Campus Chest
Drive will get underway Wednesday
and extend through December 17.
with Marguerite Bostwlck. ‘45, as
Chairman. The $500 goal which has
been set can be attained if each
student contributes 50 cents or more.

In other colleges it is customary to
request one dollar from each student.
However, since the “Big Ten” is al-
ready receiving money for the war
effort from members of the College,
the minimum student contribution
for Campus Chest has been kept
at 50 cents as in previous years.
Group Houses. Commuters

The president of each group house
will be in charge of the drive for
that respective group, several stu-
dents in the house acting as assist-
ants. To reach the commuters, ap-
proximately thirty of the students
who commute will contact their own
group for contributions.

Inasmuch as the faculty is reached
by the Albany Community Chest,
they will not be solicited by Campus
Chest. but a form letter will be sent
to them.

There will be competition between
Sayles and Pierce Halls, and any
group house which achieves a 100%
contribution will have its name
placed on an Honor Roll. All de-
partmental clubs, religious organiza-
tions, and sororities will be asked
for donations as well as the four
classes of the student body.

Miss Bostwick is assisted by the
following Juniors: Leah Tlsclilcr,
Publicity; Margaret Dee. Facility
Letters; Jean Winyall. Group Con-
tributions; Mary Now, Progress of
Campaign.

The total amount received in the
drive will be given to the National
War Chest which in turn will appor—
tion the money among various or-
ganizations such as Infantile Par-
alysis, ’l‘ulmreulosis. Greek. Chinese,
and Russian relief, and Bundles for
Britain.

Last year's Campus Chest goal was
also $500, but the returns failed to
attain more than the $325 mark. in
spite of the tremendous increase in
war needs.

Mis Bostwick emphasizes. “Those
students who contribute to the Cain-
pus Chest. will not be solicited by
any outside organization. Fifty
cents is a relatively small amount,
for if cuch studan were asked to
contribute to every organization.
the mnoiint spent would greatly ex—
coed whiit Cumpus Chest is request-
ing this your."

central committee are Eunice Baird.

last Call for Old Clothes
Shoes in Greek Relief Drive

Winter’s set in: snow has
fallen; the temperature’s drop-
ping—Yes. contrary to current
belief, even Greece. the land of
sunshine and gaiety. becomes
cold and bitter in the winter!

What are the Greeks to do
when there is no coal or fuel?
Fighting alone does not keep the
blood warm! Clothes are needed
—warm. woolen clothes and
good shoes. The Old Clothes
Drive. sponsored by Classical
Club, will continue until next
Friday. The biggest demand is
for skirts, sweaters. trousers,
suits, and all types of children’s
clothing.

There is still time to send
home for any old clothing or
outgrown clothes of kid brothers
and sisters. Next to the Stamp
Booth in the lower hall of
Draper is a large box in which
all contributions are to be placed.

 

Sophomores Plan

contribution to the war effort. the
Class of 1946 will present an Auction-
Dancc on Saturday. December 11,
at 8 PM. in the Commons. General

This affair is the first of the two
major war projects which the Soph—
omores are conducting for the United
War Effort as outlined in Rivalry

rivalry points will be awarded to the
class which is most successful in its
United War Effort. Judges will de-

the student body will be auctioned.

items as clothes, jewelry. pictures,

dancing at a price ranging from one
cent up. General auctioning will
begin at 9 PM. There will be a $25
War Bond given away. along with

Feldmahn Speaks

Before Assembly

Speech Will Launch
Campus Chest Drive

Alexandra Feldmahn. Assistant
Executive Secretary of the World
Student Service Fund. will speak
today in Assembly. Her purpose
here this morning is to point out to
the students the possibility of co-
ordinating college fund-raising ac-
tivities with the united national
drives. Her speech today is the in-
troduction to the official opening
of the Campus Chest Drive which
begins Wednesday.

Miss Feldmahn. a Russian. came
from Russia about three years ago
at which time she enrolled as a
Junior in Pembroke College. grad-
uating in 1942. She here received
the Student Government Association
award for the girl making the most
outstanding contribution to the life
of the college.

Before coming to America, Miss
Feldmahn attended the American
College of Sofia for two years. Her
varied experiences in college life
make her unusually well-fitted to
talk to a group of college students
while her life in war-torn Europe
enables her to understand student
problems in war-time.

The World Student Service Fund
writes of Miss Feldmahn: “Her fine.
strong and unselfish sense of values,
her organizational ability and her
experience and gift as a speaker fit
her exceptionally well to interpret
to American students the cause of
World Student Relief."

After Miss Feldmahn‘s speech. the
business of the meeting will take
ace. The proposed two amend-
ments introduced two weeks ago will
be voted upon. The one amendment
concerns changing the Board of
Aiidlt and Control back to the old
name, the Finance Board, and the
second provides for an appropriation
of $10 to be used in buying linoleum
to be placed beneath the coke
machine.

students enrolled on or before Nov.
12. Although sewing or knitting can-
not be cnrried on at present. the
Council will have substitutes for
them so that every student may par-
ticipate in seine war work.

There is also an urgent need for
office workers at the Russian War
Rclicf headquarters. Those people
interested in either Surgical Dress-
ings or R.W.R. should consult the
bulletin board outside the Dean of
Women's office for directions. They
should let War Council know about
this outside work in order that a
record may be kept.

Plans have been made by War
Activities Council for the State Fair
—~t.hc first of the Big Ten for the
new year. All group houses have
been notified so that work may begin
soon. Any group on campus which
is not included in the houses may
also participate. should they so
desire.

Whither To Go: P.

120 Women Get Invitations;
Bids To Go Out Monday

The sorority rushing season will
reach its climax with Buffet Supper
tonight from 6 PM. to 9 PM. and
Formal Dinner tomorrow evening
from 7 PM. to 11:30 PM.

Formal invitations to these affairs
were sent out on the Monday pre-
ceding Thanksgiving vacatlon. The
190 invitations sent out were dis-
tributed among 120 girls.

Frosh To Be Escorted

According to information released
by Helen Brucker, ’44. President of
Inter-Sorority Council, the Buffet
Supper and Formal Dinner will
follow the same procedure as last
year. Sorority girls will call for
freshmen for Formal Dinner, and
accompany them home after it.

Silent Period will be lifted for
these occasions. In keeping with the
policy of the last two years. no
decorations of any sort will be allow-
ed.

Sororities 'l‘o Submlt Lists

The rules concerning bidding are
also similiar to those of last year.
Each sorority must hand in a list of
the girls whom they are willing to
accept for pledgeshlp by 9 o’clock
Monday morning. Blanks will be
sent to all freshmen women through
the Student Mail on Monday morn-
ing. On these cards the freshmen
will list the sororities they wish to
join. in order of preference. The
cards must be returned to the office
of the Dean of Women by noon,
Monday.

Kids To Be Sent Monday

After comparing the freshmen
preferences with the lists handed in
by sororities. Dr. Ellen C. Stokes,
Dean of Women, will send lists of
names of girls who may be pledged
to the sorority presidents by 5 PM.

Bids will be mailed out Monday
night to girls living in group houses.
and the commuters’ bids will be sent
via Student Mall.

When the pledges assemble at the
sorority houses on Tuesday at 5:30
P.M.. the Silent Period will officially
come to a close.

According to the policy set two
years ago. each group may pledge no
more than fifteen members of the
freshmen class, and the pledgeship
may be extended for one year.

Upperclussmen may be bid
throughout the year, but for the
Junior mid Sophomore classes. the
fifteen maximum must not be ex-
ceeded. This is because the fifteen
limit rule went into effect two years
ago when the present Juniors were
freshmen. The Class of '4-1, the
present seniors is the only one which
is not affected by this ruling.
