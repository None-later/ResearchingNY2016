College Students
Learn Russian

Nicholas Siniapkin, a native Rus-
sian is conducting classes in Rus-
sian at the College every Monday
and Thursday from '7 to 9 PM. in
Huested Hall. Approximately twelve
State College students attend the
classes.

Mr. Nicholas Siniapkin was born
and educated in Russia. He taught
engineering before coming to Amer-
ica around 1921. At present he is
an electrical engineer for the City
Public Works. His son, who also
attends the classes, is a student in
the Milne School.

In his classes, Mr. Siniapkin
teaches about the geopraphy and
civilization of Russia as well as the
language itself. Discussions of such
things as the Cossacks and White
Russia add interest and humor to
the classes. Paintings and artists
will be discussed in the future, and
songs, beginning with Dark Eyes,
will be learned in Russian.

, Since it is not too late to begin the
Russian lessons, students who are
interested are urged to attend. There
is a small fee of ten cents per hour.

Photo Club To Be Organized

Precipitated by the unusual dis-
play of student interest in the recent
Photo Exhibit, a photography club is
now in the process of organization.
A short meeting of all those interest-
ed in joining will be held Wednesday,
January 4, in Room 109, Draper.

Those interested who are unable
to attend are asked to contact Anita
Feinstein or Helen Stuart. Juniors,
via student mail.

"No Mail For Serviceman”
ls Forum’s Plainlive Cry

“I haven‘t time to write."
“There’s nothing to say."
“But he’s married!"

Oh, yes. there are plenty of
excuses and alibis—plenty of
supposedly good reasons a State
girl can give for not yet writing
to the serviceman whose address
was given to her by Forum.

What is all this raving for?
Several hundred girls signed
their names on a sheet of paper,
thus pledging themselves as
college correspondents to some
former State man. They were
asked to write immediately to
keep the servicemen posted on
State news. They were asked to
make sure that the address was
correct and to keep Forum post-
ed on changes of address.

To date, at least half of the
girls who signed up have not
written.

.lolm Niles—

(Omifinucd from Page 1/
hillbillies. Moreover. he is the only
folk singer who is rated as a re—
cording artist for RCA-Victor Com-
pany along with Toscanini. Caruso,
and other music notables.

Niles feels that the United States
has failed to make use of its folk
music to build up a strong national
spirit as Germany, Italy, Russia, and
England are doing now. Because
Americans do not realize the import-
ance or beauty of their own folk
songs, Niles feels it is his job to help
write them down and keep singing
them so that the ballads will not be
lost to people of future centuries.

Dr. Louis C. Jones, Assistant Pro—
fessor of English, will have Mr. Niles
as a guest in his folk lore class. The
singer will give a program of his
ballads for the students.

 

State Comes To Aid
0i Destitute Greece

Although last Friday officially
ended the Old Clothes Drive, stu-
dents continued handing in coats
and other articles of clothing as
long as the box remained in the
lower hall of Draper. Geraldine
Merhoff, ’44, President of Classical
Club, the group sponsoring the drive,
announced that the campaign was
successful.

Old clothes and still new “old-
fashioned" clothes have been liber-
ally contributed by the student body.
Warm coats, suits, and woolen
dresses and sweaters composed the
major part of the collection.

The clothes received were in good
condition and will satisfy the need
that originally stimulated this drive.
The clothing will be sent to the
Greek Church on Lancaster Street
which is the head of the Greek War
Relief Association.

On the last day of the drive, Miss
Merhoff said. “By their cooperation
and enthusiasm in this project. State
students have shown their willing-
ness and ability to help on another
of the many present war fronts of
Civilian life.”

 

College Banner Arrives

The State banner. given to the
school by the four classes, arrived
last Saturday, according to Patricia
Latimer, President of Student Asso-
ciation. The banner will be hung in
the Commons.

 

HERBEHT’S

1054 Madison Ave. Albany, N. Y.

A line in the State College Dir-
ectory reads “Sayles Annex, 203 On-
tario Street, 2-2013,” listing the lone
residence hall for men on campus.
Complete with eighteen men, a pool
table. and Bob Sullivan, house man-
ager, Sayles Annex is the remaining
incentive for Pierce girls to hold
open houses for college men.

As even the gay young sophomores
will remember, last year's already
weakening ratio of men was scat-
tered in KDR, Potter Club, Sayles
Hall, College House, and SLS to
mention a few. 203 (the former
SLS house) now stands alone with
approximately 40 per cent of the
State men under its roof.

For those unfortunate souls who
haven't seen the interior of the
"Modern Man‘s Mansion," a tour
will acquaint them with it. The
living room has in its center a large
pool table, or should it be said the
living room centers around the pool
table? Incidentally, a pool tourna-
ment open to all male students was
held this falli so the pool table is
still in the middle of the living room,
of course. ’l‘here‘s Jim Miner and
A1 Beninati sitting on top of the
piano supervising the "eight-ball"
players.

Dick Smith and Jim Conley, fresh-
men, are official hash-tosscrs when

anyone is hungry between those
comfortable, cold walks to Pierce
at 7:15 in the morning and six at
night. As entertainment between
courses, Manny Miller comes out
with his Miaeolu Shuffle, it combin-
ation of She Had to Go and Lose It
at the Aslm' and Why Don't You Do
Right.

“Happy is the day when the An-
nex gets its pay.” At the beginning
of the year, poker was the favorite
pastime of equalizing those what
has with those what hasn’t. A
Communistic system of share and
share alike is now in order, what
with Christmas holidays and the
usual empty jeans drawing near.
“If one fellow has the money, we
eat," is the motto.

Art Kaufman‘s ‘32 Chevrolet af-
fectionately dubbed “Queen Vickie"
carries the weight of many a night-
ly visit to the Boul. Before starting
on their nocturnal life, all the men
rush for one of Clyde Cook's sport
coats and Mark Blunt's red, white,
and blue tic.

Former State men now in the
Service have popped in now and
then to be welcomed by McF‘cclcy,
Russell, and Sullivan. George Kunz,
Pete Porcino, Clancy, Oarr, Ed. Hol-
stein and Dale Wood are a few of
the visitors to the home of the
low end of the 15:1 ratio.
