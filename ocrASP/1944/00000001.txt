to a smashing close Wednesday with
the aggregation of $433.01 via stu-
dent association contributions. The
returns this year exceeded iast year's
intakes by approximately $108.

Taking into consideration the pres—
ent enrollment of the student body,
the actual goal expected by a 50
cent contribution from each student
was $443, but according to chairman
Marguerite Bostwick. '45. this sum
had been jacked up to $500 in order
to achieve a round number for pub-
licity purposes. As there are still
a few scattered returns to be made.
the $443 may yet be attained.

and school organizations, as well fBS

Drive. $236.86 was given by the group
houses. $73.65 by the Commuters.
and $125.50 by the various organiza-
tions. the faculty, and the depart—
mental clubs.

Seven group houses were successful
in reaching the 100% mark in con-
tributions. The Psi Gamma sorority
house was the first to report that
the 1009; level had been arrived at,
and they have also pledged them-
selves to contribute $100 to the
City Chest. Chi Sigma Theta, Nel-
son Hall. Kappa Delta, Gamma
Kappa Phi. Alpha Epsilon Phi, and

Music Council Guest
To Sing Ballads, Carols

John Jacob Niles, singer, player,
and collector of folks songs in this
country, will be the guest of Music
Council in Page Hall at 8:15 on
Wednesday in a recital consisting
of folk music including English and
Scottish carols and folk songs, and
American folk ballads sung by the
mountain folk of Tennessee and
Kentucky. He is an authority on
American folk ballads written by
unknown musicians.

Niles‘ father initiated his son's
career by teaching him seventeen
verses of Barbary Allen which Niles
sang in a school contest in Louis-
ville. At this time. he was encour-
aged by a music critic to continue
his singing.

Plays Ancient Instruments

Mr. Niles has received more rec-
ognition as a player of ancient
instruments than any other present-
day musician. The dulcimer on
which he plays resembles an over-
sized guitar. He always sits in a.
chair while playing, with the dul-
cimer on a table in front of him.
With a clear, keen voice. Niles has
the remarkable ability of reaching
notes well above high C with case.

As a result of his war experiences
in World War I. Niles compiled two
books of songs; the first. Singing
Soldiers, a collection of Negro war
songs. and Songs My Mother Never
Taught Me, containing forty—three
verses of Mademoiselle From Ar-
iiicnlicrcs. As a ferry pilot under
the leadership of Captain Fiorello
LaGuardia, he was able to visit var-
ious soldier units. making notes on
their singing.

"as Sung Before President

Niles has sung programs of folk
songs. ballads, and carols before the
President and audiences in Paris
and London and at Oxford where he
is recognized as an authority on
the English carol.

Critics have noted that Niles'
audiences are more stirred than
ever by his songs now that the war
has brought music by Americans to
Americans much closer. Neverthe-
less. the United States has failed to
make use of its folk music to the
great extent that Germany, Italy,
Russia. and England are doing now.
Mr. Niles' job is to help record the
songs and keep singing them so
that the ballads will not be lost to
Americans of future centuries.

Besides his recital in Page Hall,
Niles will appear in Room 20 at
12:30 PM. on Tuesday before the
English 40 tFoiklore) class conduct-
ed by Dr. Louis C. Jones, Assistant
Professor of English. Any State
student is welcome.

Students will be admitted by stu
dent tax ticket for the \Vcdnesday
evening recital. Regular tickets
are $1.10. higii sciiooi students being
admitted for $.55 mid servicemen
free.
