Well, here we are hitting the old
time clock again and burrowing our
sly way along the same old ruts.
Monday saw the same, the oft-
repeated greetings. The 1944 model
greeting leaned to the peck on the
cheek and the “Why darling, you
look stunning!" rather than to the
firm hand-clasp and the “hello, old
man, how are you?" However, the
bright yellow bantam of “Have a
nice vacation?” “No, thanks, I just
had one." was as popular as ever.

What two roomate-members of

Christmas cards?

Whilst on the subjects of the sea«
sons greetings we should like to fol-
low the reasoning of Lt. Pete Mar-
chetta and AC Dutchy Erbstein who
left unsealed their "free" Christmas
cards. Perhaps they thought that
they were saving the government
money.

The Student Association wound up
one up on MAA the Thursday before
vacation when they reacted the
wrong way to a psycoiogical experi-
ment in the way of Assembly an-

do just that by Kiss of Death Inc.
There is a grisly fear stealing over
us that we don’t understand women.

A certain stiffness in the Joints
reminds us of something we were
going to say. To wit, that the winter
sports picture hereabouts has been
sadly lacking in those calling for
activity in the great out-of-doors.
Oh, come to think about it we do
vaguely recollect something about

mean something a little more access-

gone before.

Since tobogganing and skiing re-
quire hills and hence transportation
to said hills we had best put them
into that hazy land of “after the
war.” That leaves ice skating as one
of the more neglected forms of
muscle bruising and building.
Skating No End of Fun

The art of propelling oneself about
the ice‘ with a minimum of wear
and tear on the back pockets is one
that can be enjoyed by one’s lone-
some or with a group. The game of
hockey is one of the better games
that the continent offers. Not to
go too deeply into the fantastic
but the dating possibilities of skat-
ing are profuse and are decidedly
on the good clean fun side. a point
which is worthy of serious consider-
eratlon in a town that exhausts its
entertainment facilities with a few
movies and myriad taverns. Of
course, there is always the “studying”
date.

Washington Park is available, but
possesses several disadvantages,
chiefly the fact that after a day's
skating by the populace of Albany.
any new ice is ruttcd. slushy and in
general not pleasing to your sensitive
skater. Also, the More-mentioned

STATE COLLEGE NEWS, FRIDAY, JANUARY 1, 1944

State Basketeers Hypothetical Susie Eats Wheaties,-
Vs. ABC Tonight They Let Her Down--But Hard!

Tonight State’s fly-by-night bas-
keteers will fly downtown to the
YMCA where they will take on the
Albany Business College five in a
return contest.

The team will go into tonight's
fracas in somewhat better shape than
they were in for the pre-vacation
game with the Business men. Regls
“Hepper” Hammond has recovered
from the seige of the flu which laid
him up for the first encounter.

The team has had the benefit of
a few practice sessions since return-
ing to school. Despite the difficulty
of getting enough men together who
can make the five o'clock practices,
the key men of the attack have been
showing a decided improvement in
ball handling and scoring punch.

Tonight's starting five will prob-
ably consist of Hammond, Dickin-
son, Beninatl, Fancher and Kiley.
Others who may see action are Mll-
ler and Lehman. The latter may be
unable to make the contest.

Win Initial Contest

On Thursday December 16, the
State basketball team succeeded in
upsetting a supposedly stronger ABC
team, 26-24, on the court in Page
Hall. Although handicapped by lack
of practice and reserves they came
from behind to win in their initial
contest of the season.

The contest was close all the way
through with no team at any time
leading by more than 3 points. Led
by Lehman and Beninati, the State
men kept up fairly against the ABC
quintet. The mid-point found them
trailing by 2 points. In the second
half the ABC men took the lead
under the leadership of Enos and
maintained it up until the final 3
minutes. Then. with a sudden spurt
during which Dickinson contributed
4 points, the State five came from
behind to win 26-24.

High scorer for the home team
was Beninatl with 8 points. Dick-
inson trailed him with 7. The indi-
vidual high scorer for the game was
Enos of ABC with 12. Lehman’s
clever ball-handling and generally
good floor game also made them-
selves felt in the State victory.

 

populace is too numerous for the
State mob to drop the inhibitions
and cavort in a manner most pleas-
ing to their little hearts.

There is a large field between the
Dorms that lies idle and useless all
winter. Ineffectual attempts have
been made to fix the place up into
a skatery but due to one reason or
another they (the attempts) fell
through.

It would be nice if someone who
knew the right people would see
what could be done towards turning
a little water out to freeze. We are
sure that the girls would coooperate
and chip the ice off their radiators
to start the puck rolling. Perhaps
the symphony orchestra would play
the Skaters Wait: for matinees.

————By Audrey Johnston

State’s hardy sports' enthusiasts
seem to have enjoyed many and
varied adventures during their all-
too-brief Christmas vacation. Skat-
ing far out-ranked all other fields
of outdoor entertainment, with bow]-
ing and sledding as weak runners-up.

Suppose we let Susie represent this
ambitious group of athletes. Bright
and not too early on the first day
of vacation. after a hearty meal of
Wheaties. she started off for that
ubiquitous mill-pond. She prob-
ably decided that it would be best
if she went in the morning when
traffic wasn't too thick.

No doubt. her first act after test-
ing the ice with various branches,
boulders, etc., was to attempt to put
on last year's skates over nine pairs
of socks and a foot that had quite
amazingly grown two sizes. As a
concession she removed three pairs
of the socks and crammed her feet
into the skates, regardless of their
obvious deficiencies. ‘

Then came the really interesting

part. Her first few steps, to say the
least, were faltering. As she was
picking herself up from a horizontal
position for approximately the 18th
time she began to suspect that she
was a little out of practice.

Four hours later as our heroine
wearlly walked home on her ankles.
she contemplated her unhappy fate.
She was willing to sacrifice her time.
her energlI. her dignity, her all—
but nothing could compensate for
the loss of that very vital bicuspid.
No sport was worth THAT!

And so on the next morning, bright
and not too early. and for many
mornings afterward, Susie could be
found cozily sleeping her days away
in quiet security—which is some-
thing like a bed, only cozier.

A week later, as a rather feeble
gesture of good sportsmanship, she
deigned to bowl one whole game.

Well, maybe she wasn’t so hardy,
or enthusiastic—but she has return-
ed refreshed, invigorated and ready
for a banged-up finish to the first
semester of sports for this year.

 

Chi Sig Victors
In First Cage Tilt

Chi Sigma Theta began WAA’s
1944 basketball season auspiciously
by defeating Gamma Kappa Phi,
27-2. The Chi Sigs were sparked
by the fast, clean-cut playing of
guard Fran McCormick, ’47, a new-
comer to the Page Hall court—one
who deserves watching. High scor-
er of the game and captain of the
team, Mary Domann, garnered eight
points in the last five minutes.

Gamma Kap earned its two points
by making two out of four foul
shots. Betty Philips and Alice
Young, captain, accounted for these
two points.

The second game was a spirited
contest between Beta Zeta and the
Pierce Hall “Rares”. Beta Zeta, the
more experienced team, won 30—21.
Gloria Baker and Leda LaSalle. cap-
tain, of the BZ team, were high
scorers of the evening, both earning
fourteen points for their team. Jean
Davidson, captain of the “Rares,”
was high scorer of that team, mak-
ing a total of eleven points.

The two games were spirited ones.
a good sign, portending a successful
year for WAA basketball. However
all four teams were definitely in
need of practice. Fumbling, missed
foul shots, and sloppy playing in
general were the predominant fea-
tures of the games.

Only one game is scheduled for
next Wednesday night. Moreland
Hall will play Farrell House at 7:15
in the Page Hall gym.

Table Activities Hit
Stride With 3 Going

The ping pong tournament. which
is one of the main features of the
winter sports program, has been
making rapid progress. This week,
plans are being made for the open
doubles. Pairings have been posted
on the MAA bulletin board and to
date twenty contestants have signed
up to play in the tournaments. From
all accounts the games will be hotly
contested and the final outcome is
unpredictable.

The names of a few dark horses
appear on the list along with several
well-known proponents of the sport.
Bob Ferber, champion of the men’s
tournament is slated to play with
Beninati, The teams of Garfall and
Herdman, and Lashinsky and Gia-
velli, are also among those listed to
compete in the battle for champion-
ship.

The first round matches will begin
this week and they must be over by
January 12. The finals will take
place on January 31.

The MAA pool tourney is tempor-
arily inactive. Before the Christmas
recess began the contest was near-
ing its final stages but due to the
fact that the Sayles Hall pool table
is unavailable the tournament has
been postponed.

The women's ping pong tourna-
ment has not yet been completed.
The first round matches were all
played before vacation but up to
this time only one of the matches
of the second round has been played
off

 

Margo Byrne

Life comes to WAA’s bulletin
board! We debated with ourselves
the advisability of saying “WAA
bulletin board comes to Life," but
the board itself hasn’t moved. The
point we are trying to make is that

you can still view it daily in the-

lower hall of Draper. It has not de-
parted to the offices of a certain
widely-read magazine.

And it has become something to-

vlew. First of all the pencilled scrib-
blings that the girls have been con-
tenting themselves with have been
transformed into large,
posters. We would belittle them if
we confined ourselves to the ad-
jective “readable.” For they are
works of "posterart."

Gone the sorry spectacle of the
would-be athletic sophomore getting
a stiff neck trying to decipher, over
a table and eight heads, the 2X2
notice for Wednesday's basketball.

The posters are now being held
up by as many as four (count them,
four) thumb tacks out of WAA's
precious store instead of the former
spit and prayer.

This leads to a professionally neat
appearance, but gives us reason to
wonder if we have come to the right
spot.

It is the same feeling of vigor that
hit ping pong before Christmas.
Kiley actually jcannon-balled the
men’s tournament to completion in a.
matter of days. And we have been
insisting, all a tournment needs is
administration.

From here he could take over the
doubles which has remained in a.
state of quiescence. Doubtless with
a little effort it could be finished up
in a matter of hours.

As regards the progress of the
woman's tourney, Gal-fall, for one,
was heard to state that she was
waiting to be challenged. Exactly
what she meant we are not certain
since she is scheduled to play Eger-
ton in her next match.

But we are eagerly awaiting the
arrival of a few inches of snow to
witness the enthusiasm for winter
sports shown by the student body
on Activities Day. This promises
to be something rare, but, oh well.
it's a female perogative to change
her mind. Activities Day was way
last Fall, before the leaves fell and
along with them, the temperatiure.

The bowling captain, Clara Hill,
cannot make up a schedule for the
inter-house tournament until all the
teams have been turned in. Those
girls in the individual houses who
are responsible for doing this. might
stir themselves into action.

Breunig Plans
Poster Panel,

improvements
Commission To Install

Coke Machine Soon

The revised Campus Commission,
under the leadership of Marjorie
Bruenig, ’44. newly elected Grand
Marshal, has launched the primary
plans for fulfilling the purpose of
reorganization: “to make and enforce
regulations pertaining to the general
upkeep of the College."

A plan whereby all posters will be
mounted on a six-inch panel. instead
of being pasted anywhere along the
halls, is underway. Temporary bulle-
tin boards will be put up for the
posters until the panel is up. This
complies with the effort to bring the
posters up to college level by im-
provement in the size of posters and
their distribution.

Coke Machine

Dr. John M. Sayles, President of
the College, reported to the Commis-
sion that the coke machine will be
installed in the Commons before
examinations begin. Campus Com-
mission will have charge of the coke
machine. and will draw up rules
governing its use. The group will
also issue warnings to students who
fail to observe the regulations.

Campus Commission now consists
of the former members and the
class marshals. The large number
of members and the additional work
brought by reorganization will neces-
sitate the election of a secretary and
a treasurer.

Freshman tryouts, similar to
those of other Student Council or-
ganizations, will be held under the
new system. At the end of the
term. the outgoing members will
choose the new members for the
following year.

Constitutional Meeting

There will be a meeting of Campus
Commission Monday at 7:30 PM. in
the Pine Room of Pierce Hall for
the purpose of drawing up a consti-
tution. Those students on the 001m
mittee for drawing up the constitu-
tion are Herbert Brock and Bertram
Kiley. Seniors; Florence Garfall and
Martha Sprenger. Juniors: Helen
Slack and Marie Licbl, Sophomores;
and Elsie Stockinan. '47.

The co-operation and interest of
every student is sought by the Com-
mission to improve the appearance
of the College.

The Chairman of Campus Com-
mission. Grand Marshal. will be
chosen from the Junior members in
the spring election.

performance «frequent enough to
be an annoyance. but not too fre-
quent to be tiresome) Helen Slack,

commodities after the best form of
national advertisers.

As the program is nearing an end,
the All-Star Cast will spring one
last surprise on the expectant aud-
ience. Shrouded carefully beneath

Club To Present
Spanish Picture:

The Waves, a realistic film story
of the fisherfolk along the Gulf of
Vera Cruz, will be presented by
the Spanish Club, Pan Amigos. on
Friday, January 21, in the Page
Hall auditorium at 8 P.M. The
story of the film is based on the
struggles of these people against
their surroundings and man-made
objects. In addition to the movie
is a short, entitled Pun-American
Bazaar.

The first film is a sixty-six min—
ute presentation. For the benefit
of those who are not Spanish stu-
dents, there will be subtitles in
English, explaining the plots.

Since it is becoming increasingly
difficult to obtain foreign films, this
presentation is perhaps one of the
last opportunities to see an authen-
tic Spanish movie.

Catherine Rice, ’44, and Janet L.
Smith. '44. are in charge of publicity.
and the distribution of tickets for
the performance will be conducted
by Jeanne Rosct, '46. and George
Paulas. '47; Ruth Calvin and Helene
Nichols will set the atmosphere with
attractive arrangements. Several
State senoriias will usher in Span—
ish peasant costumes.

Pan Amigos intends to send invi-
tations to all the high schools and
nearby colleges where Spanish is
taught, us well as to students in the
extension school. The performance
will begin at 8:00 P.M., and tickets.
which are 25 cents plus tax. will be
sold at the door.

The proceeds from the presenta-
tion will be used in various ways
depending on the degree of success—
if it is cspccialy well attended, the
money will be divided between use
in the group itself, and donation for
the War Activities Fund; however.
if the latter is not possible. the Club
intends to sponsor another activity
some time in the future.

has left college. Lucille Gerg has
been elected to fill the secretarial
office which Miss Hall formerly held.

Usually the members of the BAC
are elected by the student body. but
as the semester is almost over, the
Student Association decided it would
save an appreciable amount of time
if an appointment were made rather
than an election.
