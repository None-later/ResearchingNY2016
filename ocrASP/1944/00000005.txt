Organization of the Majority . . .

'l‘he metaphorisis of extra-curricular and social
activities at State is almost complete. The scholas-
tice year of ’42-’43 brought slow and barely per-
ceptable changes—student leaders were unable to
make definite substitutions for abandoned activities.
This year the cycle is more complete; State’s activ-
ities are now completely adapted to war-time de-
mands; social affairs combine both entertainment
and patriotism. And the results to date have been
highly satisfactory.

Other social activities are organized by the soror-
ities. These, too, are different from those of last
year, but they are still very definite and worth-
while supplements to State’s outside entertainment.
These groups would succeed in rounding orrt the
social and extra-cirricular picture if their member-
ship included more than 330 students. True, the
number is more than one-third of the student en-
rollment, but as compared with the 500 girls who
do not belong to sororities, it appears slightly un-
balanced. Outside of general school events, what
provision is there for the social activities of non-
sorority girls? The group houses offer somewhat
similar affairs for residents, but not all non-soror-
ity girls live in group houses. And sorority girls.
too, participate in these. For commuters, there is
a Commuters Club. But here again, only 75 stir-
dents benefit by its offerings.

With independent students in the majority, surc-
ly there are several student leaders capable of or-
ganizing all into a group which can manage and
direct affairs just as capably as any sororal group.
in many other colleges independents have organ-
ized with very successful results.

To become a \vorkablc organization, this group
would have to iravc a central meeting place. How—
ever, with strong leadership and a sizcablt- mem-
bership, this would not be too difficult. The (‘orn—
rnirtcrs Club bcars out this point. The club, ill five
months, has accomplished several worthwhile ob-
jcctivcs with the commuters interests at heart. ;\nd
here again an old gap in students' organizations
has been filled. Perhaps. an independent group
might use the Commuters Club as a starting point
for organization since most of the members are
non-sorority.

Such a .‘it‘[) would complete State's [)l‘tigl't‘» in
exttit-curricular and social activities. It's worth
looking iirto, since the potential powers of an indc-
pcndcnt group are innumerable. Non-sorority
members nright do well to investigate such an or—
ganization instead of sitting back and complaining
about being pushed iirto llrc Inickground by thr-
sororities.

ways, the remaining week of the semester should
be utilized well to prove that we realize the valui-
of education. The attempt to make up lost time
can do no harm. Or is the warning superflurtus?

STATE COLLEGE NEWS, FRIDAY, JANUARY“, 1944

At the performance of John Jacob
Niles last Wednesday evening, this
listener was introduced to something
new and different. Undoubtedly
this experience was shared by a
large number of the audience. These
impressions are. then. those of one
not versed in the art of folk-singing.

It is fortunate that there is a
John Jacob Niles in America. He
is one of the few students and ex-
ponents of an art that is fast dis-
appearing. A generation from now.
and this particular aspect of Amer-
ica’s culture will be but a vague
memory.

The style of delivery of this folk
music by Mr. Niles is absolutely au-
thentic. No one could listen to his
rendition of the songs without being
impressed by his unusual voice. Mr.
Niles himself called it a "male alto”
voice. emphasizing that he did not
sing falsetto. Especially remarkable
was the wide range of his voice and

WW

 

In those intervals of brooding.
mutterings to myself. and hasty gerr-
eralization that I grace by the name
of thought. there are seine continued
problems which tense my fuddled
mind. And one. oh fellow students.
is the growth in college of what I
label “intellectual fascism." Beside
the American fascist, I know of noth-
ing more dangerous to the growth of
the admirable institution known as
the American way of life.

To me, intellectual fascism is the
fond belief that because we’ve had
the luck to get what is laughineg
called “higher education." and learn
some ill-assorted facts and fancies.
we’re more fitted to be citizens than
those who haven't gone to college.
Without further prelude I say such
a theory is pure nonsense.

If anything about the American
tradition gives one an incoherent
sense of pride. it is the tradition of
the New England farmer who
brought the new Constitution with
him as he ploughed his field. and
memorized it, thinking meanwhile
of its implications. before he would
vote for it. Or the tradition of the
townspeople gathering together in
a tavern as the village schoolmaster
read them Tom Paine's latest pain-
phlct. In other words, that thought-
ful consideration of national prob-
lems regardless of education or
position.

And that is as it. should be. In
America one has been rather proud
of the fact that there is no need to
go to the "right" school to get a
government, position. or come from
the “right” sort of family to go into
politics, or have the “right” sort of
an accent in order to meet “people
that count." That is something one
is supposed to have left behind in
the Old World.

Tlrcn wiry, I keep asking mysclf.

the perfect control he displayed in
reaching the really high notes.

The carols, in which Mr. Niles
seemed most interested. were beau-
ful in their simplicity. To hear his
rendition of “The Seven Joys of
Mary” is a real experience. In terms
of audience interest, the ballads by
far were the most popular. The
Ballad of Barbary Allen, perhaps
because it is more generally known,
was especially enjoyed. However.
in our opinion, the highlight of the
evening was his singing of “The
Hangman." which demanded all of
his artistry in the execution of its
wide range. and in conveying the
deep. simple emotion inherent in the
song.

His accompaniment on the dulci-
mer rounded out the strange and
beautiful charm of an evening lis-
tening to the songs and ballads of
early America.

 

 

That is, I repeat. pure nonsense.
Those of us who have the stuff.
would have had the same potentiali-
ties whether we'd gone to college or
not. College has perhaps given us a
superficial knowledge in some fields
of learning. but it has no mysterious
faculty for making us superior
beings. That must come from with-
in us.

Our faculty has been kind in not
pointing out several unassaillabie
facts. One, that our courses here
are a mere g’ieaning. We seem to
think that one semester of econom—
ics, and a few phrases like “marginal
utility" sprinkled through our con—
versation makes us. erga. great

covering 1500 years. We are sup-
posed to know one or two works by
each author there is room to include
in the course. almost completely skip
the great tradition of English prose.
and whoops. my dear, we know all
about English literature!

None of its knows really anything
but a few facts and sortie hazy
theories, and yet so many of us seem
to think we have some miraculous
right to consider ourselves “deep”
thinkers.

The more reading of a few books,
and the memorization of certain
all—too-obvious facts gives its no
strangle-hold on common sense or
clear thinking. Too often. when
coupled with smug complacency. it
just confuses lhc issue. Oh, fellow
students. if we learn anything irr
college let it be the divinely simple
fact that knowledge is cvcrytr'lrerc.
free for the taking: that triillr is
universal; that philosophy abides in
gutters and class-rooms alike.

Here in America we have believed
that each man may cducirlc himself
as hr- sees til; we have thought that
the straight clciir' mind abides on
every street. and may be claimed by
anyone. whether he once rrradc 124

AN OPEN LETTER TO A SOLDIER
Dear Joe,

I finished your socks and mailed them off to you
yesterday. I’m sorry that your sweater didn't fit but
after all you can’t learn knitting in a day and any-
how who is going to notice that one sleeve is a couple
of inches shorter than the other? If anyone had ever
told me that in my Junior year in college I would go
into a decline and spend my Saturday nights knitting
and going to the movies I would have ...................... .. I
would have bought a parrot and cat to bring along
with me.

Your letter pretty well burned me up. Listen. Joe.
if you think I get any kick out of the things I'm doing
now. you'd better think twice. Why from the way
you talk you'd think that my life is simply one un-
mitigated round of pleasure after another. And what
is it really? Well. let me tell you.

Next Saturday I'll go down to school and spend all
day in the cold fixing a booth for the State Fair.
Then at night are and about three other girls from
the house will go down. stay in the booth for awhile
and wander around the place till we get bored and
then go down to the corner and get a sundae. All
this and movies too is about the extent of my social
life. We play so much bridge that I'm beginning to
look like Horatio‘s Last Stand. Exciting? You're
not kidding.

I get a letter from you once a week. You tell me
about irow the food stinks. how far you had to march.
how you hope you‘ll get a furlough soon how you just
got your medal for marksmanship and you end up
with a six—paragraph discussion on the gun you use.
Maybe at the end you stick a couple of xx’s. Sure I
like to hear about what you are fi'llllLl. birt every time
I get a letter you seem to be farther away. You're a
stranger writing about things that I don’t tinder-
stand and can't associate with the Way you could
shoot a basket or the loud shirts you used to wear or
the sweet things you used to say sometimes when we
were alone. I'm just the girl back home.

And I get dissatisfed. I see all the girls come back
with wedding rings and their excited talk makes me
feel out in the cold. Jane joined the Waves and she
writes about all the wonderful things she‘s doing.
And ine—I s‘t home and write you a letter or study
my Spanish or get a headache wondering how any-
body can put on shows without men.

The school is different. Everybody is just existing
until they pass through this period and things go back
to normal. Classes are just class-es. You feel that
you could be doing so initch more somewhere else.
The routine is irritating and the adjustments diffi-
cult.

So you see. Joe. I‘m not having such a good time.
Many times I envy you. At least you‘re living.

LOVE. SALLY.

Famo’us Educators Shows, Booths Slated for Fair,-
Group Houses Plan Concessions

In Radio Forum

In cooperation with Education
For Freedom. Inc.. the Mutual
Broadcasting System is presenting
a series of distinguished speakers
every Monday night from 10:15 to
10:30 PM. These discussions seek
to awaken all Americans to their
country’s educational problems and
to stimulate an active interest
toward finding its solution.

Education for Freedom. Inc.. is a
non—profit organization which has
been formed by a group of American
citizens deeply concerned with the
educational situation. In the last
quarter of a century. the democratic
principle that man is fit to govern
himself has received its most serious
challenge. When this war is ended,
democratic peoples will have to work
with each other and with other
nations of the world to secure peace
and to advance mankind. To do this
well, a complete and thorough know-
ledge of modern American educa-
tion is necessary.

Some of the evidence that the
problem exists is startling as re-
ported by this non-political organi-
zation. Out of the 7,000 students
of 86 colleges questioned in the
New York Times History Test. April.
1943. 66 per cent could not name
even two of the functions of Con-
gress: 55 per cent weren’t able to
give as many as two of the specific
freedoms guaranteed to the individ-
ual in the Bill of Rights; 85 per cent
were unfamiliar with Thomas Jef—
ferson’s contribution to our history.

A high-ranking Adrnirai, speaking
of high school graduates says: “Of
the 4200 freshmen wanting to enter
the Naval Reserves Officers’ Train-
ing Corps who were given a carefully
prepared selective examination at
27 leading colleges, . . . 62 per cent
failed the whole test. Tire majority
of cases were far below passing
grade."

Education for Freedom. Inc. be-
lieves that Americans should ser-
iously examine our educational sys-
tem and see if it. cannot be improved
so that our children may become
better fitth to make the hard
choices that the citizens of a demo-
cracy must make in the interest of
the common good.

State Fair. fourth of the Big Ten,
will flash across State's campus
complete with peanut and popcorn
stands, magic shows, and bee-yoo-
ti-ful girls. Under the direction of
War Activities Council, every group
house will have some concession to
raise the “mercury” in the money
thermometer way over the boiling
point of $1200.

A cry of “Helpl” ringing from
Huested to the Commons comes
from the unholy halls of the House
of Horrors. Boris Karloff in his
most chill-producing role. or Kiley
ieering in "Othello" could not be
paralleled with the skeletons to be
pulled out of the closet the night of
the 12th.

will do a take-off (not in Gypsy Rose
Lee style. of course). on that People

gather a crowd that would make
any Stat Fair win blue ribbons.

Yo’ lil‘ “Black Bombers” will shuf-
fle their feet in the Minstrel Show.

bringing the dusky South way up
No’th to the State Fair. The end
men and minstrel songs will produce
an unbeatable combo of music. dan-
cing. and laughter, “Rufus. Raatus,
and Johnson Brown” providing the
slapstick.

For those who have the aim of
Jesse James, the strength of Samp-
son (before Delilah) and lots of
copper coins. the Penny Arcade with
Gamma Kaps as hostesses will be
an ideal hangout for the evening.
The one who can toss a penny in a
floating dish 300 feet away is lying;
the fellow who hits Hitler in the
head with a dart should be Presi-
dent; but everyone will have a try
in pitching and tossing the U. S.
mint in the Penny Arcade.

One might think that the bearded
lady is a thing of former'days, but
with Sayles Hail staging a freak
show, even she may not be extinct!
The man with 15 toes. Maizie the
Midget. and the fellow who walks
through boiling oil may be hidden
behind the secret curtain of the
Sayies concession.

“And now. ladies and gentlemen,
step right up for the big surprise of
tlze evening. The students and
faculty on the WAC will present
something novel, unusual—some-
thing that will hit between the eyes,
ending with awards and prizes to
the best concessions of the Fair.
That's it, folks. Take your time.
Plenty of seats down front . . . . "

 

McAllister, Watchman
At College Died Monday

James McAllister, night watch-
man for State College. died sud-
denly of a heart attack at his home

hours for extra—curricular activities.

Burial services were held Wed-
ncsday.

watchman who worked in the col—
lege from 12 midnight to 8:00 A. M.

came acquainted with him.

Card Sharks,-

Will Sponsor Bridge Tournament

“Who'll be fourth for a couple of
hands of Bridge?" is the far flung
cry. In the News Office. in the
Lounge, in the Commons. in almost
any nook or corner. at any time. can
be found a quartet busy with the
eternal battle of bidding.

In Ed. 10 it's called substitution,
but, it might. be called a desperate
attempt to cling to fire few remain-
ing threads of college spirit and
morale. First. it was the ping~pong
torrrrninrcrrt. their the women’s foot-
ball i“lll;il(’. and now. lo—irnd-bchold,
a bridge it'llli'llllllll’lli.’

Alu‘ Phi will sponsor the said tour—
nament the second week of the sec-
ond semester. Claire Schwartz. '45,
in charge of the "bridge brigade."
urges all the ducts who have gained
tnmi- its card sharks to sign up in
pairs on the poster which will be in
the lowcr lnill oi llr'npcr'.

The extension of scattered bridge
games irrto a unified group is likely
to provide some intellectual stimu-
lation. turd at the same liinc din-rt
onc‘s rrrirrd from "the boy I was left
behind by." Compared to figuring
otrl a way to make the bid. a problem
lll llilir-rcrrlial Calculus is a cinch.

’l‘hrouahont the tourminrcnt, the

contestant will keep the same part-
ner. All games will follow Culber-
tson’s rulc. Score-keeping is to be
conducted on the honor system. with
players keeping their own scores,
since there will be no proctors.

Most of the playing will take place
in the Commons, but there will prob-
ably bc tournament games conduct—
cd in the evening at. the dorms.

At the close of the bridge tourna-
ment. the pair with the highest.
score will be awarded a prize.
What more beside the cnjoymcnt,
and competition, and prize to the
whining couple could one demand
for the ten cents that will be charged
its entrance fee? Wnr Activities
Council will be the recipient of the
dimes.

Yes. the gap in State's activity
partially caused by the shortage of
rrrcrr. is gradually being "bridged."
