The miserable condition of the be-
mumped and chicken-poxed inmates
of the Sayles Hall isolation ward, 116
the game room. is an abrupt re-
minder to all of us that there is
noorganized system of taking care
of the sick at school. We have seen
really sick boys in group houses lying
in bed all day with nobody around to
give them a hand. The present epi-
demic of epidemics could have hap-
pened any time in the history of
the school. It is reasonable to expect
similar ones in the near future and
for a few years after the war. Yes.
we know. times are tough all over,
but makeshift methods cannot satis-
factorily solve temporary nor per-
manent problems.

Hi, Neighbors

The recent activities of the Colle-
gians have widened our scope and
caused us to take a brief look at our
neighboring institutions of the high-
er 1.

First we’d like to congratulate
those four RPI'ers who made the
All-American soccer team. That’s
about as good as you can get. Sim-
ilar congrats to their two teammates
who made the second squad.

In contrast to the talent famine
at State, RPI is enjoying one of the
best years in its athletic history.
Their football team was good and
their basketball squad is a powerful
aggregation. and has dropped but
one game. to Colgate. Wonderful
thing, this Navy program.

The V-12’s and V-5’s have also
given our Schenectady neighbors.
Union. strong athletic squads. While
not undefeated. their basketball team
is very good and a real tussle is in
prospect when the rivals from way
back tangle tomorrow night. We
pick RPI.

The Siena basketball squads. which
zoomed into local and national prom-
inence with a couple of really sen-
sational clubs, have brought us the
best basketball we have seen here-
abouts. Not receiving a greal deal
of aid from its Naval trainees. Siena
has been struggling along with a
predominantly freshman squad and
the difficulties of a last-minute
schedule. With men like the fiery
Dan Cunha and Father Maurice
Fitzgerald looking out for their bas-
ketball future, we predict that Siena
will hold her own at present and
will make her goal—big-time basket-
ball. when the globattie is over.
Cunha Has Plan

Coach Cunha puts forth a sugges-
tion that we think worthy of serious
consideration. It is that the Athletic
Associations of Union. RPI. Siena
and State get together and put on
double header basketball shows. He
believes and We agree that such an
attraction would draw well and pay
dividends to the schools. As well as
the financial gain lnvolvod, good
basketball shows are good publicity.

Cunha's plan calls for weekly or
bi - weekly doubleheaders in a
plant large enough to accommodate
crowds of four or five thousand.
With the local schools playing rcp-
resentatlvc colleges from the Eastern
area, a program would be put on
that should draw well from the stir—
rounding cities.

Whether State plays double head—
ers or by itself. we think that most.
of the students and faculty will agree
that a winning basketball team is
more desirable than a losing one.
Since our arrival the State teams
have played about .100 ball. And
that dismal record has been largely
compiled against schools in our own
class.

STATE COLLEGE NEWS, FRIDAYJANUARY 14, 1944

WAA Doubles,
Women'sLeague
In Early Stages

In the past week definite progress
has been made in the girls’ ping
pong tournaments. To date there is
only one game left to be played in
the second round. This match,
scheduled to be contested between
Giavelli and Nielsen should be com-
pleted in order to close up the second
round.

In the second round, Peg Atkins
was defeated by Bernice Cohen.
These girls are scheduled to meet
once more~this time in the third
round of the table tourney due to
Atkins win over Shoupie who was
left without an opponent in the
second round.

Semi-Finals Coming Up

Next week the matches scheduled
to be played in the third round of
the contest should be completed and
the semi-finals ready to begin. Up
to this point. Kit Herdman is the
only contestant lined up to play in
the semi-finals. Herdman finished
up her match of the third round
with a win over Lucille Rapp. This
placed Herdman in the semi-finals.

WAA urges all contestants to
come out and play off the remaining
matches of the third round so that
the semi—finals can be finished up.

The open doubles ping pong tour-
nament is making excellent progress.
According to schedule. all first
round matches have been completed
and undoubtedly the second round
will terminate on the appointed
January 19.

Competition Strong

Sullivan and Kaufman defeated
Doctor and Rapp. 21-15, 24-26. 21-11,
and thereby move into the second
round to play Hammond and Brock,
placed there due to a bye. The
Braithwaite sisters lost to Weber and
Winyall. 25—20. 25-23. The latter are
scheduled to play Giavelli and Lash-
inksy. now in the second round as a
result of their triumph over Fancher
and Lively, 25-17, 20—25, 25-18. Fine
and Schwartz defaulted to Beninati
and Ferber. making them the second
round contestants of Herdman and
Garfall. who defeateci Shoemaker
and Balk, 25-13. 25-19.
selves hoarse, they deserve a team
than can hold its own with colleges.
with similar enrollments to our own.
The boys who practice several hours
a day from November to March de-
serve more return from their efforts
than watching rival basketecrs run
around them.

We believe that a team needs
three things to win: Good material.
good coaching and adequate prac-
tice and game facilities.

We have been promised a new
gym: good coaches should be plenti-
ful after the war. Players are at—
tracetd to other schools by the
offerc of what State gives to all
students W free tuition. We stig-
gest that some sort of system be set
up to award entrance credit for
athletic ability to male applicants.
Regents marks are but one criterion
for judging the future teacher's
chances of success or failure in the
profession. We do not advocate a
disregard of marks. but suggests a
relative weight for marks. person-
ality. athletic ability. etc.

As a future member of the alumni,
We should like to read in the
Squodunk (fowl/c that good old
State has a team worthy of the
school.

State Collegians
Lose to YMCA

Sicna's chvcc's' Win
Easily on Home Ground

In a close contest the State Col-
legians were defeated by ABC by a
score of 45-42. The game took place
Friday at the YMCA.

The Collegians, led by Kiley with
9 points. took an early lead to go
ahead at the half 24-23. The teams
played equally well in the third quar-
ter and ABC led at the 30 minute
mark. Early in the fourth period
the Business College quintet went
ahead by five points and maintained
this advantage despite the efforts of
the Collegians.

The scoring race was close all the
way. Lindsay’s spectacular shoot-
ing, which gave him a total of 16
points. really provided the margin of
victory. The Collegian scoring honors
were divided between Dickinson and
Kiley with 9 points apiece.

The State Collegians met the
Siena Jayvees at the Siena gym last
Saturday. They were overwhelmed
by the JV's by a score of 30-16. Lack
of reserves and the fact that the
gym was larger than the Page Hall
court affected the decision.

The game was a slow contest with
both sides being guilty of many
errors. The Siena team led through—
out and the outcome was never in
doubt from the beginning.

Connors. guard on the Siena out-
fit was the individual high scorer
with 10 points. Kiley and Lehman
were the best for State with 5 each.

Fencing Season Begins;

WAA Hires Teacher

Marguerite Bostwick. '45. captain
of fencing. has received a communi-
cation from Brother John. modera-
tor of fencing at LaSalle Institute
in Troy. He informed her that Vin-
cent Poleto. Cadet Colonel of the
school is available for the hitherto
unfilled position of fencing instruc-
tor. Poleto is recommended as being
not only an excellent fencer. but
also the outstanding boy of the
school; therefore. he should be well
worth the negligible expense.

WAA’s fencing season opened of-
ficially last Saturday morning. with
Peg instructing the would-be fencers
in the art of the “en-guard“ posi-
tion. the “advance,” the “retreat”
and the "hinge."

Fencing is held every Saturday
morning from 10-12 A.M.. in the
Page Hail gym. There will be no
charge for at least the first eight
lessons. After that. there may be
a slight charge of 10 cents to help
defray the cost. of the instructor.
WAA furnishes all the needed cquip-
ment. such as foils. chest. guards.
and masks.

 

Georgie Plays Impartially
Glad to Share His Talents

The freshman class, whose
powers of logic were displayed so
charmingly in the recent rivalry
debate. has added another great
Thinker to our midst. With logic
worthy of a Critique of Import;
Reason, the verdant philosopher
said to himself:

“Why should I fight my way
through those five Sienites to get
a shot at that old basket. when
in back of me and not too far
away. is another basket that is
every bit as good as you hoop.”

So saying, the Fiend, alias
George Poulos, turned and was
off on a mad dash towards the
other (and wrong) basket.

Neutral observers said after-
wards that they suspected the
rcferee of being an accomplice.
for. despite the fact that George
went back of the ten second line
and took a few double dribbles,
whistle tweetled not.

With a two length lead and
the field strung out behind him,
and with the shouts, of “Hey,
George.” and "Stop George." ring-
ing unheeded in his ears. the
intrepid Poulos dribbled relent-
lessly into the basket and shot.

He missed.

Moreland Hall

Bestows Defeat

On Farrell House'

A speedy Moerland Hall team de-
feated the Farrell Hall aggregation
last Wednesday night to the tune
of 23-16.

The Farrell team scored within
the first few seconds of play. But

Moreland. regaining possession of '

the ball. held their opponents for
the rest of the quarter while piling
up eight points of their own.
Moreland Scores

Spurred on by Marcia Hollis, the

Morelanders continued on their"

scoring spree in the second quarter.
The playing was wild. with both
teams making poor passes. At the
half. Farrell was on the short end
of an 18-8 score.

The second half saw both teams
settling down. Moreland developed
some beautiful passwork and the
ball seemed generally to be under
more control. Each team scored but
once in the third quarter.

Farrell threatened once more in
the final quarter of play. garnering
six points to Moreland’s three. The

 

 

 

Bowling League
Continues Course

The bowling tournament is mov-
ing along at a moderate pace. For
matches were scheduled for this
past week. On Tuesday. January 11,
Newman Hall forfeited a game to
KD by reason of their failure to
appear.

Gamma Kap bowled the required
games but Moreland was forced to
postpone the completion of their
match until Thursday. Chi Sig was
set to oppose Phi Belt and the Beta
Zeta team to play off their match
with Psi Gamma.

Hazel Ravelle (bowling for Gam-
ma Kapt has the highest individual
score of the league—189.

The results to date are: a win for
Psi Gamma over Kappa Delta and
a victory for Farrell over Beta Zeta.

There are ten teams participating
in the WAA bowling tournament.
They are: Kappa Delta. Phi Delta.
Psi Gamma. Gamma Kappa. Beta
Zeta, Farrell. Chi Sig. Moreland.
Newman. and a Commuter’s team.
The schedule for each week is posted
on the WAA Bulletin Board every
Monday.

It is necessary to bowl fifteen
games to receive WAA credit. Games
bowled in matches count as credit
games.

So far. sixty-one people have
bowled in the WAA league and are
on their way towards obtaining
credit—this includes the pcople from
Ihc various tennis. A totul of 108
games has bccn i‘ollcd up.

Madison Avenue team was handi—
capped by lack of reserves but man-
aged to maintain their lead and
win 23-10.
Individual Honors

Hollis was high scorer for More—
land. gaining 16 of the team’s points.
Sagar led Farrell with eight points.

The freshmen on each team de-
serve watching. Mastrangclo. the
afore—mentioned Sagar and Hollis.
play like court veterans. Weaver.
one of last year’s dependables, was
not up to her usual game but will
undoubtedly improve as the season
goes on.

Receive New Monicker

The team representing State on
the basketball court has decided to
go under the name of the State Col-
legians rather than represent them—
selves as an official varsity. Bert
Kiley in announcing the decision,
stated that since the team was not
playing a formal schedule, nor teams
which were of the calibre of past
opponents. and that since the few
possible practice sessions were held
without benefit of a coach that it
would not be fair to the school’s
athletic prestige to have this year's
team represent. it. on the courts.
Games Under Negotiation

Games for next week are under
negotiation. with the Siena and RPI
Juyvccs us the most likely opponents.
In the cvcnl that any home games
are obtained. announcement will be
made of them in order that any
interested students may attend.

Uniermeyer to be D & A Guest,-
Auihor to Speak on Feb. I9

by Betty O’Neil

He was a businessman. all the way

from office boy up; he lectures;
he farms: he entertains; and
he writes too! He is the ver-
satile Mr. Louis Untermcyer. regard-
ed by Willian Rose Benet as “the
American Heine"; by Amy Lowell as
“the most versatile genius in Amer-
ten": and by Helen Grace Cnrlisie
as “the liveliest. personality" she has
ever known. But. besides these afore-
mentioned hobbies of his. Mr. Untcr-
meyer has found time to be the
second guest of Dramatlcs and Arts

urday. February 10 at 8:30 PM.

Mr. Untcrmeyer is a simple Amer-
ican. born. reared. and as he fondly
says. “mlscducated” in New York
Even his rise to fame is typical to
type. After a failure in high school
geometry kept him from college. he
began his series of varied occupa-
tions. At this time. he abandoned
his desire for a career as a pianist.
and became successively on office
boy. a salesman. and finally business
manager of a jewelry manufactur-
ing plant in New Jersey. Then. at
the age of thirty-seven. Mr. Unicr-
mcycr retired from the role of busi-

Debate Council
Sponsors Meets

A formal debate and two discus-
sions, under the sponsorship of
Debate Council. have already taken
place in the second semester with
members of the college debate team
and students from nearby colleges
participating. The first of these was
a formal debate with Middlebury
College. Tuesday afternoon.

Edith Johunson and Josephine
Kirk. representing Mlddlcbury. de-
bated with Anita Fcinstein. ’45. and
Barbara Crockcr, '47. in the Millie
Little Theater on the subject “Re-
solved: That the United States
should form a permanent alliance
with Russia at the close of the war."
Miss Fcinstcin and Miss Crocker
had the ncgntivc side of the question.
while the two girls from Middlcbury
upheld the affirmative. No decision
was reached.

Last night. two discussions were
held with Union College: one in the
Lounge. and the other in the Little
'l‘hcutcr. The topics of these discus-
sions concerned liberal education in
the post—war curriculum, and the
United States‘ luck of an adequate
foreign policy to meet post-war pro-
blems. Mary D. Alden and Edna
M. Marsh. Juniors. rtmrcsented
State in the first discussion. while
Rosario ’l‘russo. ‘45. and Jean Gro-
(Icu. ‘46. spoke for State in the
second discussion.

On February 16. March 15 and 29,
and on April it). inicrmurul debates
