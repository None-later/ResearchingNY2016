Bert Kiley

All the tales of woe that have
been floating eastward from On-
tario and Partridge Streets way
make us rather glad that we are
commuting, after all. We shall
never again say an unkind word
about the Osborne Road bus.

Mllne Wakes Up

Our red pantied friends. the Mllne
basketball team became inspired
last weekend and defeated the two
Albany public high schools on Suc-
cessive nights. Any of the basket-
ball-starved State sports fans
might do well to invest 40 cents
some night and watch our little
wards perform.

One of the most effective cheers
we have encountered is RPI’s
“Cherry and White, fight, fight"
repeated over and over by different
sections of the stands. It must
really get the boys. Cut cheers are
just about useless. The primary
purpose of inspiring the local boys
seems to have been neglected by
the composing talent of most of
our schools. Since it seems to go
with their colors. (we’re a little
vague about the exact shade) Milne
might do well to adopt it. Perhaps
State could work on some variations,
such as “purple and gold. (hold.
bold, cold, fold. sold). Or “gold and
purple, burple, burple.” That’s the
trouble, we can't take these things
or leave them alone.

MAA lost a member. the Colle-
gians lost about half their talent,
and the school lost a darn nice guy
when Hep Hammond tucked his dip-
loma under his arm and trekked off
to Hudson Falls to teach bookkeep-
ing and unearth a future Big Ed
Reed.

Kiley Selects

Having that occupational disease
of all sports writers who are worth
their NaCl (well, we can have the
disease, can’t we?) of picking all-
star teams, we herewith offer our
All-State team for the past four
years:

Forwards: Hansen and Dickson.

Center: Brauner.

Guards: Marsland and Mullin.

Marsland, Mullin and Combs were
about even in our book. but we give
the nod to Marsland because of the
old 8010 fight. and to Mullin for
his smoothness and all-around sav-
vy. Brauner, Dickson and Hansen
are in hands down. For the best
player of the lot. we’ll take Hank
Brauner. Henry was a big boy who
knew how to use his size and could
be relied on for ten or twelve points
a game.

Honorable mention goes to Combs
and Ellerin.

Off the Cuff

The ping pong table should get
a service star, now that Skolnick
has left us. . . . One of the more
wasted articles of furniture on the
campus is the pool table at Sayles
Annex. The boys just don't seem
to take to it. . . . WAC loses by not
keeping the coke machine filled. . .
We now have three honorable dis-
charges in the school, the Marines
and Army contributing one each.

Kaufman, Hess B 2 Tops Farrell; Horried by Sailors and Fatigue
Juniors Find Sanctuary

Reaching Finish
in Pool Tourney

—— by George W. Hess

“Hey, you Jerks, it’s after 7:30, so
put them cues away.”

"Aw shaddap, this is a tourna-
ment game. Where did you think
we’d play it off, in the Commons?"

Thus beset by tribulations the
pool tournament to decide the man
with the most misspent youth has
staggered into its final stages. There
remains but a short bit of play to
determine the winner.

End in Sight

At this writing George Hess and
Arthur Kaufman are embroiled in
a vicious struggle for the crown.
The doughty Mr. Kaufman holds a
slight edge over his redoubtable op-
ponent, Mr. Hess, in this uncom-
pleted fracas. After this battle is
over Sayles Hall Annex might well
be referred to as “Dark and Bloody
Ground.”

In reaching the finals, Kaufman
beat the third-seeded player, Bob
Sullivan. It was a rather decisive
trouncing, but the score has been
lost in that limbo designated for
semi-final tallies. All through the
contest Kaufman exhibited the
steady style of play that has been
his strongest point throughout the
whole tournament. He is probably
one of the coolest shot makers that
State has seen in quite some time.

In the other semi-final, Hess took
Bert Kiley into camp. This proved
to be about as easy as taking pea-
nuts away from an aroused bull
elephant. Neither of the contest-
ants had shot any pool during the
Christmas holiday and because of
this they were both a bit off their
usual form. 555 managed to pile
up an early lead only to have Kiley
pull a garrison finish that nearly
put him in the lead. Hess held on
to his initial advantage and won.
It Was a Tough Fight, Ma

In the final game Kaufman is
leading Hess by 13 balls with the
game at the half-way mark. but it
is reported, with good authority.
that Hess proposes to fight to the
bitter end. If, however, Kaufman
goes on to win. the result will ful—
fill a prediction made in this paper
at the beginning of the tourney.
When and if this happens, the auth-
or of that bit of augui‘y need only
apply at the PO. to receive his
award of “Prognosticator of the
Year."

 

 

Games N. I. For Collegians

MAA head Bertram Kiley an-
nounced that no games are schedul-
Cd for the State Collegians in the
near future. This condition is caus-
ed by the graduation of one of the
cage stars. Hep Hammond, and the
gradual disappearance of several
others of the squad.

Run-Away Scoring Seen
In WAA Basketball

On Wednesday night six intra-
mural teams contested for WAA
basketball league leadership.

The first game of the evening
brought Beta Zeta and Farrell
House to the fore and the result was
a smashing victory for the more
experienced BZ's, with a score of
66-5. Gloria Baker, of the BZ team,
was high scorer with 15 goals to her
credit. Following close behind was
Leda LaSalle, also BZ, who tallied
twenty-four points, and Dolores
Ropke of the same team, who piled
up twelve points, all of which made
the grand total of 66 points. Mary
Lou Haines led the Farrell squad
with three points.

In the second game of the even-
ing, Wren Hall fell before the KD
team to the tune of 26-6. Wren was
a loser from the beginning with the
skillful opposition offered by Camp—
bell, Shoup. Herdman and Smith.
Joan Smith of KD carried off scor-
ing honors with a total of ten points.
Two other KD‘s, Shoupie and
Campbell, were next in line with
each making ten points.

Newman on Defensive

In a hard and roughly fought
contest. Newman Hall dropped a
victory to the Chi Sig squad by a
24-8 count. The game got off to a
slow start with neither team scor-
ing until the first quarter was well
under way. Domann came through
with the first goal for the Chi Sigs
and Dunlay retaliated with two
points for the Newmanites. The Chi
Sig team, featuring veterans of the
basketball court and the competent
Garfall-McCormick-Domann com-
bination. gave the speedy Newman
sextet, some stiff competition. How-
ever. Straub. Groden and Guido,
playing as guards for Newman,
proved a powerful defense and held
the Chi Slgs to twenty—four points.
Dunlay. Slack and Russo put up a
hard struggle on the Newman of-
fensive but were thwarted in every
attempt by Latinier, Hylind and
Smith. Domann led her team with
sixteen points and Dunlay and Rus-
so each tallied four points for the
Newman score.

Ten Juniors—weary In soul, ditto
in mind, sought solace last Weekend
in the great outdoors, communing
with nature, etc.. at Camp Johnston.

On the appointed day, the “sa-
fari,” Cooper, Fillman, Bostwlck.
Dottie Smith. Giavelli. Now, Car-
many, Mason, Tischlci' and Hylind,
armed with skates, blanket rolls in
various stages of ‘.ecrepancy,—and
four packs of cards, descended on
the Albany station. At 1 o‘clock
they boarded the 11:40 for Chat-
ham. Sampson. en masse, was tak-
ing the same train. Our little
campers had quite a struggle . . .
but the sailors got away. Upon ar-
rival at Chatham, it was discovered
that there was a taxi in town. It
must be confessed that in their
weakened condition our heroines
succumbed to the temptation.

After the cabin had been cleaned
and bunks assigned, some hardy
souls went skating and the rest just
smiled lndulgently,
bridge game closer to the fireplace.

The food was served with gener»
ous helpings of cinders, but, because-

of, or in spite of them, was wonder-
ful—pancakes and sausages, ham-
burger, baked potatoes, apples, fried
ham, etc. Sayles was never like this!

Only once was the peace and sol-
itude disrupted. The little group
was gathered around the fireplace
quietly talking when the door burst
open and three bows and arrows ap-
peared, followed by the same num-
ber of little boys—Shades of Milne.

By 8 o'clock our heroines were
ready for bed but managed to hold
out till nine. No one will believe
this next—but it actually was too
hot to sleep. Giavelli built a fire
that even Dante would be jealous of.
The pajamaed group was forced to
gather in the main room while the
bunk room cooled off — fugitives
from a pot-belly.

Sunday, weary, but no longer in
soul or mind, our ten Juniors made
the long trek back to civilization
ready and eager to take up the
work of the new semester?

Ferber-Beninati
Capture Doubles

One of the highlights of this
week's ping pong news was the
sweeping victory of Beiiiiiati and
Paper in the mixed doubles tour-
nament. They defeated Skolnik and
Miller three games to one, 23-25,
25—22. 25-23, and 25-18. in the final
round. This tournament was hotly
contested all the way and there was
doubt as to who would be the
champions up to the last matches.

The Girl's ping pong contest is
speeding to a close. The original
number who signed up for this
tourney was unusually large, but

' the matches were quickly tossed

off. They are now in the semi-final
stages. Kit Herdmnn is set to op-
pose the winner of the Kuhn-Gia—
velli match. Final results should
be in by our next issue.

February 22 Marks D-Day
For State College Students

He swung his ax and the im-
mortal cherry tree tumbled to
the ground—~and February 22 be-
came a red-letter day for all
Americans . . .

He threw an ink-stand at a
weak-willed officer who had said
it was impossible to cross the ice-
clutterod Delaware—and We took
him to our hearts as a human
being . . .

He led ragged. tired farmers in
a victorious battle against the
haughty redcoats—nnd became a
great General and a great hero.

He helped organize the govern-
ment and accepted the first
presidency of the landwand be-
came the Father of our Country.

And so. Tuesday, February 22.
ihc birthday of this man is cclc-
bi'ulcd.

What does this mean to State?
—A day off—a long and glorious
day of l'i'ccdom in honor of the
mun who introduced frccdom into
