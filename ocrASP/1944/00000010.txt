Bert Kiley

Well, the secret is out. We are

 

exposed by Lt. Dillenbeck via
Klppy’s Krud. Since there’s no use
in further pretending, we may as
well tell you that the Oat-Bin is
really written by two Milne Sopho-
mores.

P. S. What prizes?

It Is with something of the feel-
ing of 'I‘schaikowsky hearing his
Sixth. Symphony rendered by the
Jerktown High Philharmonic that
we view what happens to the im-
mortal (if they mess that one up,
we're through) utterances of the
Oat-Bin, between the time it is
typed and assembly. Last week we
had a very profound observation
about cafe cheers. It appeared as
“cut cheers." If we had a grave,
we'd turn over in it.

Higher Mathematics

At the end we said that the school
now had three honorable discharges,
the Army and Marines contributing
one each. If the next two words
“this semester" had not been lapped
off, perhaps the more astute Oat-
Blnnees might have deducted that
there was one already here. Since
the statements of the Oat-Bin are
accepted without question by the
clientele. there doubtless now exists
a general misapprehension to the
effect that one and one makes three.
Sometimes we are tempted to drag
our two readers into the P. 0. every
Friday, show them the original
manuscript and fill up the space
with Earth Science notes.
Morale-lluilders

The Civil War seems to be well
out in front of the others so far
as songs go, lid/lie HI/IILII of Ilic
Republic, Wlien Jolinni/ Collies
Mare/icing Hollie, and I)i.i:i'c tower
over the current offerliigs. World
War l‘s ()Ill‘l' There has not been
touched either. The Army Air
Corps’ song (what is it's right
name?) seems to be the best that
the current tiff has produced. The
Marine I'll/lit”, though not new, did
a. great morale job that first had
winter. Come to think of it, the
lyrics to a song called The HIar
Spain/It'll. lilIIIllIJI' were written dur-
ing the War of lHlZ.

As stuff that coi'iies strictly under
the Heading of Horrors of War,
we put ’I'Iiei'e's a HIar—Hpanpled

member of the school that believes

nolic of them to be current. Por-
Iiaps the earlier efforts were at
morale and nostalgia, and the pres-
ent at escapism. (lr perhaps. and

Challenge Men
To Mixed Game

Who ever heard of mixed doubles
in basket-ball? Well. your reporter
never did either. It's one of those
things that pop into people’s heads
when they are suffering from post-
exam jitters. The situation is this:
the champion girl’s basketball team
of last year has challenged our own
Collegians to a game. Some un-
lettered soul upon asking if they
would play under girl's or men's
rules was told it would be half-and-
half. He wandered away in a daze
wondering what pipe tobacco had
to do with a basketball game. We
then stuck in our oar and wanted to
know if it wouldn't look a little
odd for the men to be running
around in bloomers for half a game.
All we received for our pains was a
fishy stare. Let 'em thrash it out
themselves. We're through trying.
Leaders Comment

Of this proposed set-to, Sandy
Sanderson says. "We'll murder them
guys. if we can only get them to
play. Personally. I think they are
scared."

This tidy sentiment is, of course,
backed up by the rest of the team.
From this corner the combination of
Sanderson, Domann, Latimor. ’l‘own-
send and LaSalle look like a tough
nut for any team to crack.

Dickinson has only this to say.
“When the women of State can do
anything but out-number the men.
I will say that someone is crazy.
.lust leavo us at 'em." Kiley, cus-
todian of the vanishing Collcglans.
mumbled something about catching
a bus and slunk off. There arc
vicious rumors to the effect that thc
Colleglans are planning subversive
activity. It has been suggested that
“fearless Fred" Puncher could be
used for demoralizing purposes.
Sinatra records are also under coil-
sidcratlon. Imagine what the voice
rendering "What u Lovely Way to
Spend an lilvcnlng" could do.

Some flnc afternoon this game will
be played ﬁnd when the smoke and
noise clear We iiilglit huvc lhc an-
chr to an age-old question.

Pool Toumey Tonight

The Kaufnuni-llcss pool final will
he played off tonight at llillll PM.
This game has been postponed sev-
eral tlnics. Kaufnuin is leading in
the match and it is about half over.
The tournament. has been dragging
along for about six weeks now.
Christmas vacation is the reason
given for not finishing it sooner.

The WAA basketball games are
now rolling along at a better pace.
Five games were played on Wed-
nesday in order to speed up the dc-
layed schedule.

In an afternoon game, Moreland
Hall was defeated by a powerful
Pierce Hall team—better known as
the Rares. Victory for the Pierce
Hall gals was almost certain from
the first quarter of the game and
was ascertained by the final score of
28-9. Dube led the Rares with 12
points and was closely followed by
Davidson of the same team who
earned a score of ti. Kuplak tallied
6 counts for the Moreland team.

The highlight of the afternoon was
a contest starring the Psi Gammas
and the Sayles Hall squad. Daly
and Bruenlg proved to be the main—
stays on the Saylcs Hall team, with
15 and 10 points respectively. The
competent Glavclii with fourteen
tallies and Plekcrt with thirteen
were lilin scorers for the Psi Gains.
who nosed out by a 30-24 lead over
Savlcs.

Activity was once more resumed
at ’7 o’clock when K1) conquered
(lamina Kup by a score of 34-22.
The KD's were in their usual form
llll(l despite the constant strllgglc put
up by the Gamma Kaps in the per—
sons of Pedisich and Phillips, they
took the lead hi the first half with
a score of 22—“). Shoup and llcrd-
mun carried off high honors for the
KD’s with it) counts cueh, whllc
Pcdlslch topped llll' (,‘iainmii Kups
with 14 points.

The closest game of the session
took place between the Phi Dells
and thc Newman squad. 'l‘hc coli-
test was hard fought from the very
start, inul by lhc lmll', Nl'Wlllllll had
a ill—12 lead over the Phi Dells.
l'Ichvcr, the duiintlcss Seymour was
not to be held down and, In spite
of the opposition. rendered by the
Newman defense, she succeeded in
lhc third quarter hi bringing the
Phi Dells lo a Bil-23 finish over New-
lllllll llull. Diniluy gained four goals
for the Ncwmanilcs and Slack liilllcd
with chcn points. Seymour walked
off with flying colors having chalk-
ed up ‘Jil points.

half the score was 22-0. Sonic flnc
pass work was displayed by the
lliikcr-lilakc-l..uSullc trio. The final
score was till-7.

 

Herdman Tops
WAA Tourney

The Women's ping pong tourna-
ment came to a smashing close Wed-
nesday afternoon when WAA’s Kit
Herdman defeated Lore Kuhn in the
final match.

Both finalists seemed nervous and
showed some reluctance to strike out
on any long shots. The scores are
the best indication of the type of
game that. was played: 21-17, 21-18,
21-19.

Kuhn was very steady and return-
ed some of llcrdnian's best efforts
with annoying calmness. The play
was, on the whole, not very flashy.
l-lowcvcr Kil was the more ventur-
ous of the two contenders. Her
cccuslonal slashes were the deciding
factor in her victory.

Margo Byrne

When in the course of inhumane
events, we arrive at that form of
mayhem known as the frosh-soph
rivalry basketball game, we pause to
call to the alleged minds of both
classes that three points ain't hay.
And just as worldly goods fall to
the lot of Godly, those three points
will go to the good little girls who
practice hard beforehand.

‘Tls said that the freshmen are-
havlng their first practice session
today, and February 25th is the dies-
irae. Bodcs ill. The sophs boast a
tried and true organization starring
Dunn, Groden. and Straub as guards
and Seymour. Shoup and Slack as
forcwards.

Shades of Horatio, Sink or Swim

And when the outcome of that or—
deal has been decided. one class will
go to a watery grave to the tune of
two points in the rivalry swimming
Illt't'i on the eighth of March.

“She is amusing for a number of
reasons, for her wit which is as
sparkling as it is kind. for her point
of view, which is blessed with a
quality of freshness and buoyancy,
and for the amazing things which
are always happening to her." Such
is Emily Kimbrough. author. editor,
publicist. and lecturer who will
speak in Page Hall, March 3, under
the sponsorship of Student Christian
Association.

The things that happen to her
could never happen to anyone else
and she is one of those rare women
who can laugh at herself and mean
it. Call any reader of Our Hear/s
Wci'e leIlIII/ and (lay forget the iii-
cideiit of a certain young woman

A great imirk of distinction for
Miss Kimbrough is her uttulnnicnt

cordcd in Bryn Muwr College while
she was a student there.

In addition to being amusing, she

As her best friend says of her,
“Emily is the only really smart

sibly because her smartness is as
unstudied as her humor. her good
nature, and her joy of living."

the Main Line outside Philadelphia,
Emily spends all of her spare time
doing war work. She has two child-
ren, A. and 13. who interrupted her
career rather abruptly when she
was fashion editor for a nationally

Colbert, Marian Anderson, Alfred
Lunt and Lynn Fontanne are among
the names on her liist of friends.
Having watched the beginning and
growth of various personalitics'
