Bert Kiley

“We’d just like to say ‘thanks' to
Cart- Pangburn. for passing up a
cozy 4-F for the Merchant Marine.
He didn’t have to go.

The Oat-bin, Dec. 16, 1943

“You didn’t have to go."

Vitriol, Feb. 18, 1944

Well, that makes three readers.

Impelled by morbid curiosity to
peek at page three last week, we
observed that Kippy objects to hav-
ing her column referred to as
“Kippy’s Krud.” Moved by an al-
most obsequious desire to please, we
proffer “Methane” as a substitute.
Webster defined the word as follows:

“a gaseous hydrocarbon, CH, a
product of decomposition of organic
matter in marshes . . . ”

It's a saturated hydrocarbon, too.

The first one of our colleagues
to discover that an cat is a crude
reed instrument will squelch us no
end.

Confined Genius Dept.

It has been interesting to note
the mutation of three of the ans'
columns. The script called for a
War Fronts, a Service and a sports
column. In selecting the personnel
for these efforts, the omniscient
News board doubtless said, “Kiley
loves sports, Ryan loves the war
and Kippy loves soldiers." The
News” future seemed assured.

But your creative genius chaffs
at and oft rebels against the con-
finement of prescribed forms. Keats
left the sonnet for the ode, and
Whitman came up with vers libre.

To drop a step in the literary
world, Ryan came up with Vitriol,
Kippy came up with her Thought of
the Week department, and Kiley
went down with MAA.

How Time Etc. I

Last Friday afternoon a disturbing
thought broke through our usual
Olympian calm. As the repercus-
sions from Assembly boomed and
re-echoed through the P. 0., we be—
came aware that we were more or
less cut out of things; that we were a
second semester Senior: that we had
one foot in the exit and Time was
crowding us out the door. Assuming
we pass our 17 hours plus make-up,
a very pleasant phase 01' our most-
ance is shortly to be terminated.
Sad Sack Dept. I

Re the MAA major office business
we take a sad look at the two D's
and an E that the mailman brought
us and come to the conclusion that
perhaps it would be to the best in-
terest of our successors to put the
old dictatorship back on the major
office list. It's a full time job for
a husky fellow to pry the gym away
from Milne and the girls; it's
another to get the fellows over there.

Hess Captures
Pool TournamenlL

Last Friday night George Hess
beat Arthur Kaufman to win the
MAA pool tournament. When the
game was postponed Kaufman was
leading by 57-44. Hess' winning
score was 100-92.

The game was resumed with
Kaufman increasing his lead with
8-6 rack. Hess then began to warm
up and successive rack scores of
12-2, 9-5 and 10-4 gave him a lead
that he never relinquished.

After the first rack Kaufman's
game began to fall apart and he
did not regain his eye until it was
too late to catch Hess. Hess played
a careful game and seemed to take
more pains with his shots than he
usually does.

In the last two racks Kaufman
shoWed evidence of the type of play
that had carried him into the finals.
In the next to the last rack he out—
scored Hess 10-4, and he had secur-
ed more than half of the last one
when Hess ran the four that he
needed for victory.

Individual champs so far this
year are:

Men's singles ping-pong: Bob
Ferber.

Women's singles ping-pong: Kit

Rivalry Basketball Tilt
Hints Close Competition

The Frosh—Soph rivalry basket-
ball game is set to take place this
afternoon. It should prove to be
one of the most interesting events
of the season.

The Sophomore team will prob—
ably be comprised of hardy veterans
of last year‘s wars. with the possi-
bility of a few newcomers who have
been outstanding—Mary Bess Ver-
noy and Bobbie Carrier, for exam-
plc.

Mary Sanderson. who is coaching
the Freshman team, would make no
definite statements regarding her
tram. However, Gloria Baker and
Fran McCormack have already
proven themselves. playing respec-
tively for BZ and Chi Sig. It is
also rumored about State that Edna
Sweeney is one of the host guards
that has been seen around in a
long time.

Giavclli, Baker Arc
Top Scorers in Games

Every game played in the WAA
basketball league this week was a
completely one—sided encounter.
From the opening plays it was ob-
vious which team was to be the
winner.

32, lead by Baker with the as-
tounding total of 29 points, scored
a decisive win over the Gamma Kap
team. Playing their usual steady
capable ball, the Beta Zetas easily
gained a 52-13 victory.

The Chi Sig-Phi Delt game was
notable mainly for the number of
fouls accumulated by both teams.
About 16 were called. The pass-
work of the Madison Avenue squad
was particularly effective, with Gar-
fall as the sparkplug of the three
forwards. Seymour was off her
usual brilliant style of playing at
first but later rallied. The game
ended in a 31-8 win for Chi Sig.

In another near-shutout game,
Psi Gain established a 42-10 victory
over Moreland. The Psi Gam team,
supported by such court veterans as
Giavelli. Pickert, Drury and Hen-
nessey scored easily against the
scrappy but less experienced More-
landers. Giavelli, gaining 22 points.
led her team. Mastrangelo, More-
IilllCI frosh, deserves ineiitlon for her
speed .and ball control.

The Rares defeatch Farrell to the
time of 33-10. Davidson, all-around
l'l'osh athlete. sparked her team with
19 points, in a fast. hard fought
game. The Hares, though an en-
tirely freshman group, show great
teamwork and spirit,

The filial game. between Newman
and Wren resulted in a 28-8 win for
the former. The playing was wild,
with neither team settling down to
business. Shots were taken from
every spot on the floor. Slack was
the star of the game and seems to
be back in her last season form.
League Standings

Though not many games have
been played so far. the league
standings are taking definite shape.
BZ, Chi Sig, KD and Psi Gamma
are undefeated. Wren, Morcland.
Farrell and Gamma Kap have yet to
win a game while. of the remain-
ing four teams, Rarcs. Sayles, Ncw-
man and Phi Delt appear in that
order.

Fencers Practice Saturday

Peg Bostwick nnnounccs that
fencing classes will take place as
usual on Saturday morning in the
gymnasium at 10 11. Ill. ’l‘hci'c arc
only five or six weeks left in which
to obtain WAA credit for fencing.

Margo Byrne

Sometime way back last April,
some ambitious member of WAA
wrote out in longhand, for the world
to read, the constitution of WAA.
It must have been quite a chore.
And we doubt if the document was

 

widely read. since it turned out that,

it covered a full eight pages or so.

In it however, the powers-that-be
of WAA had recorded a change.
WAA Flashes was to become a per-
manent part of the program, pub-
lished periodically.

This was a swell idea. There were
over eight hundred women at State
College, and while all had become
members of WAA upon payment of
the student tax, a relatively small
proportion were active. Logical dc-
ductiOi —- WAA needed a publicity
campaign.

The $64 Question

So what happens this your? The
Fldsllcs which according to the Con-
stitution, was a part of the program
and which was surely an important
means of arousing sonic spirit. made
a single appearance.

The debut occurcd sometime in
October and we have bccn waiting
ever since, first for the November
issue or even a handsome winter
sports number. Now March is upon
us and we are still waiting for Vol II.
No. II of WAA's little sheet.

It was a swcll idea Inst April. we
figure, bill even a one-page mimco-
graph ncws lcllcr is sonic work and
evidently there were other chorus
that lhc editorial staff considered
more pressing.

Maybe ihcrc's a reason why we are
still waiting. There's always the
war—or lhc paper shortage—or cvcn
the labor shorlagc. although with
eight hundrcd odd members of an
organization wc are a bit skeptical
of this lost cxcusc. Maybe there’s
just no news.

We adiuil, that if WAA's publica-
tion was lo be primarily a means of
motivalion, the necessity for it has
lessened. WAA has never had a
more uclivc ycnr lhan this one. But
until WAA has a majority of the
sludcnls as voling members. they
hnvc n nicnibci'ship quota to fill.

’l‘hcrcl'orc. ’I‘lu‘ Il'loshcs still hits
a rcuson lo cxisl. if only as a means
of rccruiling, But it should be u lot
niorc than that. It should bc a
vilol l'l'('()l‘(l of an important organi—
zalion.

Wc halc lo kccp harping but that
slcigh—ridc is still coming off, if the

"My l'h'sl iuimc is Gottfried. It
means Pcocc of God." If one had no
knowledge of his nationality. one
could dclcrmiuc it immcdialcly from
thc slow, smooth German accent of
the pleasant, fi'icndly man who came
to Stalc last ’l‘ucsdny. Hc is Dr.
Gottfried Mcrkcl, who will take the
place of Dr. Horvcy Ricc as Professor
of Social Sludics.

Born in Saxony, Germany, Dr.
Mcrkcl has somcthing in common
with Slutc studciits; hc graduated
from thc ’l‘cuchcrs College in Ger—
many. "where the training." hc says,
"is a bit more intcnsc.” From
Teachers College. he wont to the
University of Lclpzlg lo gct his
Doctorate.

Dr. Mcrkcl taught in Gcrnuiny for
some time. He wus Profcssor of
German History and Culture at the
University of Leipzig until 1030. In
1931, he lruvolcd to Gi'cccc to be—
conic a Professor at the National
University of Athcns, a German
Graduate Rcscill‘cli Institute. It was
during the six yours he taught at
the Univcrslly of Athens that he
met his wife, a graduate of Hunter

College. She was a member of the

American School of Classical Liter-
ature and u Phi Beta Kappa. At
present, she is u part-tune instructor
of Greek and Latin at Hunter Col-
lege.

Since his first visit to America in
1937. Dr. Mci'kel has traveled around

Upsala College hi East Orange. New

Jersey. After a leave of absence,
during which he served as a special-
ist on Central European and Balkan

affairs for the Office of War Infor-
mation. hc conic to State.

Dr. Mcrkcl is a versatile individual
with an amazingly wide scope of
hobbies and talents. On his farm in
Connecticut. where he and his wife
and four children. two of whom are
German-born and two American,
spend the summer, he practices his
skill in carpentry.

He had an extensive education in
music at the Lcipzig Music School
and was a mcmbcr of the New Jersey
Symphony Orchestra, playing the
viola. It is not at all difficult to
understand his keen interest in
music, for his family were violin
nuikers in Gcrniuny. Hc owns a
valuable violin, mode in 1720 by his
ancestors.

Like many scholars, hc also writes.
He has published about ten books,
among which are books in Modern
Greek and studies concerning Balkan
History. He deals, in his writing,
mainly with the cultural fields. He
has also written articles on the his-
torical development in Germany.
At present, he is working on a book
on Greece.

When asked lils opinion of State.
Dr. Merkel smiled and said he was
very pleased with the curriculum
and the sincerity with which the
students seem to pursue their studies.
He says that State, unlike most
teachers colleges, stresses strongly
the scholastic side of a teacher, thus
preparing teachers who are well in-
formed in their particular fields.

Bostwick 7 Reports
On Chest Drive

Rclurns from the third animal
Campus Chcsl. Drive throughout the
College last Full, show that the goal
of $443, or 50 cents from each stu-
dcnt. was topped by $4.01.

Marguerite Bostwick. ’45, General
Chairman of the drive lins released
a _rcport on the distribution of the
$447.01 lzikcn in. The Infantile Par-
alysis Fund will receive $25; $100
will be given to the American Red
Cross. and $310 to thc National War
Chcst.

sians, Greeks. British. French, Bel-
gians, and Norwegians; Refugee

Miss Bostwick wishes to thank the
student body for their cooperation
in making this year's Campus Chest
Drive a success. Last year, one
dollar was requested from each stu-
dent but the goal was not attained.

Students Will Discuss
Merits of Organization

Whether or not Myskania. Senior
Honorary Leadership Society, shall
continue to exist. is the question be-
fore the Student Association ln this
morning's assembly. This issue has
been brought to the front by Mys-
kania due to current criticism of the
27-year-old traditional body, similar
to that which has circulated sub-
verslvcly in past years. The final
decision will demonstrate the will
of the student body. and its ability
[0 control cvcry agent of student
government.

Myskanin, originated in 1917. was
the result of a plan for student gov-
ernment cngcndcrcd by a faculty
committee bonded by Dr. Harry W.
Hastings. Prol'cssor of English. This
first Mysknnla, the nucleus of our
present form of student government,
drew up the constitution of the Stu-
dent Association. It continued as a
group selected partly by the faculty
until 1925, when the so-callcd
“Grcat Revolt" took place. At this
time, Mysknnin become entirely a
sclf-pcrpetiiating society, and the
Student Council was formed.

What Is Myslmnin?

Myskaniu is an honorary body
composed of from eight to thirteen
Seniors, topped traditionally in the
spring of their Junior year, and
chosen for their qualities of leader—
ship and the record of accomplish-
mcnl. they have attained through-

’I‘odny's Decision

Myskania has met with varied
criticism in the post. Former Mys-
kanlas have chosen to ignore this
criticism; the 1943-44 Myskanla has
elected to bring the issue before the
students. Undcr the Student Asso-
ciation set-up. Mysknniu feels that
its existence as a secret and self-
perpetuatlng body fills a need that
no other organimtlon can fill. Stu-
dent opinion ls. however, a thing
that Myskanla feels is necessary for
carrying out the democratic ideals
of State College.

Today, the student body will have
the opportunity to discuss the merits
of Myskania. If the students do not
feel that Myskauia Justifies its exis-
tence, they may exercise today their
power, by deciding whether or not
Mysknnia is to continue.
