Now that the faculty has a Stu-
dent Tax. or. more properly, a
Faculty Tax, we can expect scenes
like the following:

A man wearing a grey suit enters
the office. He walks up to the coun-
ter and says. "Is Dr. Nelson in?" A
woman answers, “Yes, but he's busy.
Won't you sit down a moment?" The
man sits down on a leather-covered
settee. He removes a three by five
card from his pocket and nervously
twists it in his hand. A close ob-
server might see the name “Brain-
well" upon the card and the legend,
“Do not fail to keep this appoint-
ment."

A secretary says, “You may go in
now. Dr. Bralnwell.” The man rises.
hesitates a moment. then with some-
thing reminiscent ef Sidney Carton.
walks manfully into the sanctum.
The Dean is working efficiently at
his desk; from time to time he makes
a calculation on a slide rule. He
does not notice the man standing
diffidently before him. The Dean
looks up. “Sit down. Brainwell,” he

 

sa 5.

Brainwell sits. “About those cuts.
Dr. Nelsen—" he begins. “No. we'll
take care of them later." the Dean
says. “This matter is even more
important than that. You havent
bought your Faculty Tax."

“Yes, well. uh. you see—I was
going to buy it last month. but the
payment of my Buick was due and
1—”

“Now see here. Brainwoll—you
have your obligations to your fellow
faculty members. Why don’t you get
a little job somewhere if you or
your family can’t afford to pay your
way through here. Unless you pay
your tax. we won't let you be in the
faculty skit this year.”

“Oh. no. not that. anything but
that." I

“I'm sorry. Brainwell. but in these
times we cannot tolerate any shirk-
ing. Come. no dough. no show."

The man's shoulders sag. A beaten
look comes over his face. “How much
are they?" he asks.

“Six dollars.”

The man hands over a ten dollar
bill. The Dean hands him back a
one.

“The other three?" the man asks.

“Your wife.”

The man looks wistfully at the
dollar bill. ‘

“A one. only one left out oi ten.
What can I buy with a one dollar
bill?"

The great man smiles. He knows
the answer to that one. too. "A ham
sandwich at the Boulevard." he says.

Freshmen Win
Rivalry Basketball

The freshman class, last Friday
defeated their arch-rivals, the Sophs,
34-31, in one of the cleanest-played,
most exciting games seen this year.
It was the kind of a game that was a
pleasure to watch. The shrieks of
delight and horror that alternated
between the two sides of the floor
were the best indication of the way
the scoring took place.

Neither team ever had a substan-
tial lead. The fresh guards were
amazing at times. Time after time,
their interceptions broke up the Soph
attack and they even managed to
disrupt the usually perfect pass-
work of Slack and Shoup.

Baker Scores 18 Points

Gloria Baker scored 18 of the 34
points for her team. Fran McCor-
mack. streaking across the floor at a
terrific pace. was the fresh play-
maker. Gloria Russo played a steady
game. Despite their lack of prac-
tice together, the ’47 team was Well
coordinated and fast.

The Sophomore team was not en-
tirely passive while the frosh ever-
came them. Groden, Straub and
Dunn made a valiant effort to hold
down the irrepressible Baker and her
cohorts.

Slack was high-scorer for ’46. with
15 points. Seymour and Shoup play-
ed well. Herlihy did a very good Job
in forward position for the few min—
utes she was in.

The three rivalry points will be
obtained by the team who is victor-
ious in two out of the three games
played.

Gettc Dunn. captain of the Soph
team promises quick revenge. but
the freshmen plan to thwart such
action by taking the next game to
make it a clean sweep for '47.

Aililelic Doings
For Slate's Men

By George W. Hess

Strange as it may sound, MAA has
exclusive use of the college gym from
7:00 to 10:00 on Thursday nights
as long as attendance warrants it.
There has been a tuh-riffic centro-
versy raging about this all year. It
seems that some of the girls and
more than a few Milne students
didn't want to relinquish any of
their precious time to the hard-
pressed men of State. There are
people who will begrudge a penny
given to a beggar.

Now that it has been arranged, it
is hoped that the boys don't give
their big chance the old heave-ho.
Even being there will give the ferns
the idea that someone is interested
in building himself up from a
97 pound weakling into something
that would look good in marble.
Don‘t mistake that marble for the
type that small boys use in their
games of chance.

For Morning's Assembly

 

O Tempora, O Mares,-
Feline Molriculolion Endorsed

How much would it cost a cat
to see an AD play? Would it be
worlhwhlle to have a “cat tax"
—--and if so. would we let its com-
panions in for half—price? What
is lhc status of cat affairs of New
York State College For Teachers?

It seems that in the past. a
friendly creature affectionately
referred lo as the “Annex Cat" or
Alex. has been allowed to attend
our sludcnt functions. free of
chargc. However. duu to the
recent lax innovations. it has
bccn suggested that the honored
ircui be categorized as either
l'acully or student member. This
would make it possible for Alex
to have an official standing. and
a diplomatic acknowledgment
of his presence at these affairs.

Those who advocate the stu—
dent classificatimi of Alex point
out that his attendance in the
French classes has been fairly
good. while his Maih attendance
is 95"; better than those of his
enrolled coll ‘agucs: on the other
hand. the pro—faculty faction re—
hiliatcs by explaining tliai on
several known occasions. Alex has
sat al Dr. X’s desk. with an iii-
tclligcnt demeanor expressing
his teaching inclinations.

So lhc question is still a moot
onc: Is Alcx. lhc Annex Cut. a
siudcni or faculty member?

Students To Propose
Govt. Revision Plan

Student government. and more
specifically Myskanla. will be under
fire this morning in Assembly. The
discussion on the Senior Leadership
Society begun last week by Mysk-
ania itself will be continued and
it is expected that plans for the
revision of not only Myskania but
also Student Council will be intro-
duced by various members of the
student body. The continuance of
the discussion was made possible
when Debate Council offered to re—
linquish the lime alloted to them
this morning for a scheduled debate.
Myskania Opens Discussion

The initial step for the whole
question was taken by Myskania in
last week‘s Assembly when Patricia
Latimer, President of Student Assoc-
iation. announced that the floor was
open to discussion on the issue of
whether or not the existence of
Myskania as an organization was
feasible and compatible with the
wishes of the student body. Miss
Laiimcr stated that it was the cen-
scnsiis of the opinion in Myskania
iliat opposition to that body had
been steadily growing among the
students and that therefore Mysk-
ania itself believed the question
warranted open discussion on the
Assembly floor. Trecc Ancy. ’44,
then stated Myskania's case, enum-
erating their accomplishments this
year and justifying. in her opinion,
why Myskania should remain on
campus.

Myskania's Case

Miss Ancy said in part. “Myskania
has for its purpose three things:
1. to serve as a judicial body for the
Student Association; 2. to preserve
the traditions and interests of the
student body; and 3. to provide a
means of bettering student-faculty
relations." Mis Ancy further stated,
“Some people have been heard to
say that Myskania is not a demo—
cratic organization and therefore
ought not to exist in a democratic
society. Before you can analyze this
point you really have to think, ‘What
are the implications of democracy
here in our own organization?
1. That the existing form he made
up of students; 2. that it work for
students; and 3. that the final con-
trol be vested in all the students . . .'
In everything we have deiie this
year we have tried to be completely
democratic. Since Myskaniu is a
group of activity heads, ideas for
change come spontaneously. We
didn't sit down and say to each
other, ‘Now let's think of an idea.
Let‘s change something.’ All the
ideas that came to us sprung up
from 3 to 3';- yeurs of working in
school affairs."

In summary she said. "We believe
in Myskaniu. We are very sincere
when we say that Myskaniii is it good
orginiizalimi. We think that a body
made up of seniors who are activity
heads hus constructive ideas. has an
interest in the student body and is
willing to work hard. Do you, in a
democratic society. abolish an or-
gunizution lhut is good for society?"
Putnam Presents Case

Barbara Putnam. '45. is expected
to try mid refute these arguments
in this morning's Assembly. Her
points will include, “If any group
liikc upon itself the right to inter-
prct the sentiment of the entire
group and to follow its interpreta—
tion with action. that group should
be democratically represented in the
student body. I feel that Myskauia
is not democratically representative
of the student body, and therefore
should not be allowed to exercise
those rights. These are some reasons
