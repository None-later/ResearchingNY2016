Progress of a. column

Miss Ryan devoted her column to

the following imposing list:

Oct. 8—Wheeler Dec. 3—Hearst

Oct. 29—Pegler Dec. 10—Ryan

Nov. 5—Ryan Jan. 7--Guess Who

Nov. 12—Ryan Feb. li—MacArthur

Nov. iii—Ryan Feb. 18—Two Ryans
March 3—Kiley

Stop. Ryan! You have reached the
crest. The rest of the way could
only be down.

Here we sit home on a Saturday
night. gnawing pencils and tearing
out great handfuls of hair. writing
what was to be a super Oat Bin—~
and what happens? That old Mys—
kania has to go and put their little
item in and nobody evcn reads the
Oat-bin.

The Inevitable

Since we’re on the distasteful sub-
ject. we'd like to say that the afore-
mentioned story was as nice a bit
of journalistic deck-stacking as
we've seen in some time—and we
live in the land of the Times-Union.
and the Knickerbocker News.

Not having our protractor handy
we couldn't measure the exact de-
gree to which the story was “slant-
ed," but ‘twas mighty oblique. No,
you oaf. not opaque. definitely not
that. Following the best sports
page tradition. the box-score was
included, but due no doubt to lack
of space. the other team's score was
omitted. If we will be pardoned
(and we're sure we will) a little
class pride. we'd like to point out
that that box score also represented
the total accomplishments of the
past four Myskanias. Things can
be done by an iiilcrcslcd body, with
or without robes.

Since the blackfrockcd ones asked
for opinions (that was the purpose
of it. wasn't it?) it would be rude
not to comply. And. since we'd
sooner go without our morning
Hemo than be rude. we state

In our opinion. State would be a
better educational institution with-
out Myskania.

Why? To” you some other time.

What in its place? Anybody ever
hear of Student Council'.’

And The Inevitable

We have been neglecting that
portion of our public which relies
on the (Jul-bin for information
about the future. Having been
gazing more of late upon the pos-
terior regions of ball No. 8. rather
than into thc old crystal ball. we
have gotten slightly out of touch
with the infinite. We hasten to
make amends.

MAA Oiicrs
Various Sports

Last Thursday night MAA held a
open house for the boys. It was a
huge success. Seven guys were there.
These pioneers looked as if they
were enjoying themselves. even if
they did appear lost in the vastness
of the gym. The boys played at a
form of basket-ball known as
Offense and Defense. This game is
played by dividing the players into
equal sides with the play revolving
around just one basket. The other
night the boys played three to a
side with the odd man acting as
referee.

Box-master Beninati wasn‘t there.
but the boys went ahead and put on
gloves in spite of his absence. Bob
Dickinson appeared to do all right as
did Bert Kiley. The punching bag
did not receive much attention be—
cause the boys seemed to prefer a
moving target.

Two or three of the more powerful
werc tossing a medicine ball around.
From the medley of dull thirds and
anguished walls that issued from
those boys. the going rnirst have been
tough. The mats were kept rolled
up all evening. so no one attempted
to do any wrestling. The presence
of a couple of gi'unlers and groanei's
would have livcncd up the whole

MAA wishes to aiiouiicc that on
next Thursday and March 30 no pro-
gram will be offei'cd. The Monday
Musical and ’I'Iic Milmdo are being
presented in that order in Page [-liill

the gym Monday night.

Newmanitcs,

Rares Lose Twice;
Sayiesmen Rout Chi Sig

The program of WAA's basketball
league was interrupted this week by
the tests Monday afternoon. Only
l'our games were played off.

In the first of these games Chi
Sig maintained its undefeated status
by a 33—9 victory over the Rares.
The Pierce Hall team put up a stiff
struggle. led by Davidson. but the
more experienced passwork of the
Chi Sigs proved its undoing. Garfall
and Dornann of the Madison Avenue
squad played their usual capable
ball but it was evident that they
missed the speed and dcpendabiliy
of McCormick who was out due to
a knee injury sustained in the Chi
Sig—BZ game.

Newman Defeats Pierce

On Wednesday afternoon the
Newman Hall sextet gained a 30-15
victory over the Pierce Hall team.
The game moved along at a rapid
pace and at the end of each pcriod
lhc Newman Hall team held the
lead. Russo was top scorer l'or lhc
Ncwmanilcs with Ill points and
Mal-lino hcld second placc with a
score of 9. Davidson lcd lhc Pici'cc
Hall Rai'cs with 6 tallies.

Beta Zeta walkcd ol'f with a vic-
tory as a result of an encounter with
a hard-fighting Morelaiid squad. A
valiant sti'iigglc was displayed by the
Ivlorelanders and the usually power—
i'ul Baker. LaSallc. and Ropkc were
constantly held down by lhc More-
land dcfcnsc on which Wheeler
seemed to be the mainstay. Baker
led the BZ's to victory with 22 points
while Maslrangelo rallied with 10
points foi' the Morclandcrs. The
final score was 35-25 .

Despite the difficulty of having to
carry on for three quarters of the
game wilh only five players, the
Psi Gains came lhrougli with a
23-12 win over the Wren I-Iall girls.
Pickcrt and Giavclli shared top
place with 12 and 10 points respec-
livcly.
li'arrell [forfeits (lame

F‘arrcll was scheduled to play the
KD's but the contest was forfeited
as Farrell l'ailcd to appear.

'l'hc final clash of the series look
l‘lllCt‘ when the undefeated Chi Slgs
were forced to bow before the Siiylcs
I-Iall troop to the time 01' 20-15. The
Siiylcs sextet had a strong dcl‘cnsc
in the persons of Clark. Dann and
Margot which held the invincible
Domaiiii to a score of 12. O‘Grady
spark-plugged the Sayles offense
with 10 counts and Daly scored 6.

As a result of Chi Sig's defeat by

bcalcri learn in the league. A loss

Poor fmsh! 'I‘hcy looked so pitiful.

This causcd some slight confusion
whcii lhc Sophs were iiivciglcd into

WAC Places Wonl Ad
For Blood Bank Chairman

Wanted by War Council: a
chairman from the Junior or
Senior class for the 1944 Blood
Bank Drive.

The Sophomores and freshmen
have been outstanding in blood
donations to the Red Cross Blood
Bank this year. But . . . the
Juniors and Seniors are yet to
have their names listed as blood
donors for' 1944. And why? Mainly
because there is no chairman to
organize a drive for the classes
of '44 and '45.

War Council has a remedy for
the problem. It asks that Juniors
and Seniors submit. their names
if interested in organizing this
year's Blood Bank Drive. From
lhc list of volunteers. War Couri-
ell will sclcct a chairman.

Isn‘t lhcrc one Junior or Senior
who would answcr War Council's
want ad?

College Students in Denmark
Bicycle, Speak Four Languages

by Marie

Denmark . . . . before the war . . . .
white-washed houses and Hans
Christian Anderson . . . . coffee and
pastry at 4 PM. . . . . folk dancing in
the evening . . . .

These were the impressions of
Pauline Foster. gym instructor. while
studying in the Gymnastic People's
College at Ollerup. ninety miles from
Copenhagen.

The Gymnastics College was in
charge of" Neils Bukh who intro-
duced gymnastic systems because
he felt that the farming boys and
girls needed cxcrcisc to relax the
body and make it flexible. People
considered it a great honor to have
graduated from Bukh‘s school. Bukh
traveled around the world with a
group. giving demonstrations of his
alhlclie work; in fact. Troy was one
of the cities which he visited while
in the States.

Since farming was the chief oc-
cupation. the boys had to work in the
fields during the summer and attend
school in the winter. The girls
sludicd while the boys worked. al—
lhough some of the boys were so
eager for an education that. they
went to classes very curly in the
morning. swciilcd in the fields. then
poui‘cd ovci' books in night classes.

Scudder

Many students who attended the col—
lege at Ollerup slung their duffle
bags on the handlebars and peddled
the ninety miles from Copenhagen
without wilting. Miss Foster her-
self remembers only too well a ten-
mile ride to the movies in driving
rain. Then. after wetly collapsing
in the theater. she found that the
actors spoke in German and the
translation was in Danish! Women
were often seen blithely bicycling
with a child on the handlebars and
another jouncing along on the back.

Farmers (being the wealthiest
class) and teachers were highly re-
spected in Denmark. After receiv-
ing a college education. girls re-
turned to their communities and
taught for nothing. They consider-
ed whut they could give. not get—-
a salary being a trivial thing to
them since they were satisfied with
a very simple existence.

Those students in America who
are struggling in el cspmrgiiol and
lc frdiicrri's would be speechless be—
fore Danish girls who spoke French.
German. and English besides their
own native tongue.

State studentsivwithout bicycles
and three languages through the
experiences of “profs” such as Miss
Foster who have studied abroad. ac-
quire a “hands across the ocean"
fraternity with college students of
other countries.
