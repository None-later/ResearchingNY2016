Not that you won or lost

But how you played the game.

The above is one of the two sports
maxims that have stuck in our
mind. It seemed particularly ap-
propriate in its original setting——
hanging in the room of one of the
best sportsmen and nicest fellows
ever seen hereabouts—Bill Haller,
’41.

The other slogan was also apro-
pos of its setting. Perhaps more ap-
plicable to war tactics than the for-
mer, it being in the dressing room
of the Albany High football team.
It said:

Results, not excuses.

Gripe, Vintage ’42

An item came up in the recent
Myskania tiff that is of enough
universal import to warrant rehash-
ing. We refer to the reading of
Bernie Skolsky's letter. This letter,
or parts of it, was read in assembly
and reprinted in the G1. column.

We hope Bernie didn’t know what
he was doing. He was using his
position as a soldier to give an emo-
tionalized appeal for a status quo
State. He did not hesitate to speak
for the entire group of State stu-
dents in the service. The fallacy
becomes more apparent when one
considers that Bernie was never a
typical State student. However. he
would have made Myskania.

Any individual who uses this
“soldier” devise is guilty of cashing
in on the war. Rickenbacker did it
last year. Others have pulled it
since. It will be used in national
and world politics in the near future
to gain selfish ends. It’s easy to
spot if you're looking for it. Watch
out—it’s dangerous.

With all this quavering-voice
“boys out there" business floating
around, we can't help recalling a
day in the fall of ’42, when some of
our “patriots” were quite nasty
about refunding a half year’s Stu-
dent Tax to State students who
would leave for the Armed Forces
before the end of the first semester.
The purpose of the “no refund" was
to protect the secret surplus, which
since has been clipped for its items
ranging from curtains to Kilcy's
picture. The total refunds would
have amounted to about 35 dollars.

An interesting epiloque is the fact
that when one student left this
year, she asked for and got her
refund. -

Suggestion to the girls of '44:

"You're getting out this year. Un-
like Combs, Forrest, McCabc, Bar-
selou, Ashworth and the rest, you
have been permitted to finish your
education. Join up or shut up."

 

 

Our chief, once removed, Carl
Mitchell, ’42, checked in. Didn't
seem to like our efforts. Scnscd a

lack of sports. Suggestd the Out
Bin quit the fooling around and

get some V-12's here so we can have
some sports. "ch, sir."

Our immediate predecessor, Pctc
Marchctta, ‘43, was around a few
weeks ago for some dancing, ping-
ponglng, basketballing and Danish
pastrying. Maintainer! a tactful
silence on sports page topics.
Challenge

Wcaricd of trick motions, ambigu-
ous terms, etc, Messrs. Wurtz and
Kilcy hereby challenge any
members of the Studan Association
to a debate on the topic: Resolved:
that Myskania be abolished.

STATE COLLEGE NEWS, FRIDAY, MARCH 11, 1944

Sayles Hall Triumphs Twice

Psi Gam, Phi

Newman, Gamma Kaps,
KD's, Rare: Conquer

The WAA basketball league had
a busy week with seven games being
played off and the league standings
becoming more definite.

Hollis proved the star of the Gam-
ma Kap - Moreland game. The
spunky Moreland frosh led her team
from an almost complete shutout at
the half to within '7 points of the
winning Gamma Kap squad. The
game started off slow but livened
up after the halfway mark to end
with the Morelanders trailing 23-16.
Rares Triumph

Wren met the Rares in a slow-
moving encounter. Davidson turned
in her usual capable job to pace the
Rares to a 20-11 win.

In a fast, rough game, Sayles came
from behind after trailing for the
first three periods to eke out a 25-
23 victory over Newman. The Sayles
aggregation showed some Well de-
veloped passwork. Daly and O’Grady
sparked their team, while their
guards did some hard fighting on
the other side of the floor.

Phi Delt. led by Seymour and
Braithwaite, came from behind
after trailing Gamma Kap for three
quarters, to win 30-24. In the last
period of play, the Phi Delt squad
played excellent ball, holding their
opponents down to 4 points while
gaining 12 of their own.
Superwoman Giavelli

Giavelli, in the Psi Gam, Farrell
game, reached the realm of the bas-
ketball great by scoring 30 points
in one game and beating all indivi-
dual records in the league so far
this year. The game had little else
to distinguish it. Farrell played
hard but was doomed from the start.
Sayles Upsets BZ

The Saylesmen defeated BZ in
another of their upset games.
Breunig starred for Sayles with 18
tallies to her credit. The Partridge
St. squad has developed into a fast,
capable team. Their victory over
BZ puts the latter into the twice
defeated column and maintains
Sayles’ record of but one loss. The
game was a hard fight all the way
through, with the guards on both
sides doing creditable work.

Moreland's game against Newman
was uninteresting. From the begin-
ning it was obvious that Newman
was to be the winner and the score
of 26-5 in favor of Newman bears
this out. Moreland showed flashes
of brilliant playing but could not
sustain these lOlig‘ enough to be any
real threat.

An Epic Struggle

Chi Sig and KD waded into each
other to produce an exciting game.
KD scored first and lost the lead
only once when Chi Sig pulled
ahead by one point. Both tennis
played a hard. driving game. but
KD‘s gliﬂl'dlllg was effective when
the chips were riown. Domann and
Hcrdman were respective high
scorers for Chi Sig and KD with 12
points apiece.

Last Fencing Class Tomorrow

Mr. Vincc Poictla will not be
present for fencing classes tomorrow.

Soil-Boll Added
To MAA Book
Players Wanted

by George W. Hess —

 

 

Softball is just around‘the next
thaw. That is, if MAA can find
enough talent. In normal times there
are ten men relegated to each team.
On occasion players have been heard
to complain that the other team was
using eleven. However, an umpire
should never be considered a player.
The Roving Reporter

Several men have been interview-
ed as to their desire for tripping
over the sod diamonds. Herb Brock
said that he had too much to do.
Dave Lehman was sent by the idea
and expressed his willingness to
play. Bert Kiley, who hit the first
home-run in last year’s intramural
play, was also agreeable to the sug-
gestion. This is three, but there
should be some men among the in-
coming freshmen who like to wave
the willow wand at a high hard one.
If there are, please get in touch with
Kiley at the P0.

In former years, softball was one
of the big athletic events of the
Frosh-Soph rivalry. Because of the
shortage of men last year no game
was played. but in 1942 the sopho-
mores roundly trounced the fresh-
men 14-3 and won the three points
that were then awarded for the
game. If the sophomores could
scrape together a team the fresh-
men fellows might have a chance
to win a few points for their class.
Them Were the Days

Intramural softball has seen some
rather interesting races in the last
few years. The type of games that
were played is best shown in the
EEP—KB fracas of May, 1942. KB
was off to a 10-0 lead in the first
inning only to have Potter win it 11-
10. The climax of the game came
when Bill Dickson of EEP hit
story-book home-run with a man on
base to win the game.

Softball is quite different from
baseball in many respects. In out-

In outward appearances softball
looks very much like baseball. bill
in addition to the ten mcn pcr lr-um,
it is played with a larger ball, a
smaller but and bases that are lhirly
feet nearer to each other than lln‘y
are in hard ball. The players also
wear sneakers instead of spikes. All
these things inukc u fasl, cxr‘illng
game. Also, it gives the l'cuunc
fatnles of Static something 10 swoon
about.

Stale Is Out To lunge
With Swords At 20 Feet

Foiled again! They say fencing
is an invaluable asset to any well-
rounded, er, personality. After
all you never know when you will
be called upon to fight a duel, you
know. It’s best to be prepared!

Tomorrow morning at 10 AM.
State’s dashing damsels are plan-
ning to “touche” their rivals to
pieces in the Page Hall arena.

The rules will be regular, but
not so the contestants. The men
(yes, read it again) from La Salie
Institute in Troy are set to oppose
our girls on the field of honor.

All those with gory temper-
ments are invited to come and
watch the proceedings and may-

Sophs Capture
Swimming Event

On March 9, the rivalry swim meet
was held in the Public Bath No. 3
on Central Avenue. It was a victory
for the class of '46.

There were six races to which a
total of 40 points was allotted. The
first, netting 5 points for the Sophs.
was a relay. Janc Mills and Jean
Groden brought this event to a
neck and neck" finish, out. of
which Groden emerged thc victor.

The next event was a novelty
race, in which all contestants had
their hands tied behind their bricks.
Gloria Russo and Jay ’I‘rnvcrs.

Basketball Points“
Taken By, 47

Last Friay afternoon Page Hall
court was the scene of one of
the hardest fought games of the
rivalry series. The green and white
squad came through with a 37-32
win over the Sophs as a result of
an overtime period.

The well organized teamwork of
the Frosh sextet gave Dunn, Gro-
den and Vernoy, and ’46‘s defense,
a great deal of trouble. Despite the
difficulty encountered by the Soph
defense, they were sucessful in
holding Baker to two baskets.

The Frosh score ran up as they
dropped one free throw after another
due to eighteen fouls committed by
the Sophs.

Russo was the spearhead on the
Fresh offensive and led her team to
victory with 23 points. Margot and
Sweeney, guards on the Frosh squad,
obstructed the scoring efforts of
Seymour and Slack. In spite of this
opposition, Seymour walked off with
15 points followed closcly by Slack
who tallied 11.

At the close of the regular con-
test the score was deadlocde 31-31.
In lhe overtime period the Gremlins
gulncd six points. forcing the Sulli-
vnn sextet to bow out in defeat.

This victory was the second for
Fresh out of the three games played
for rivalry points. Three points were
awarded to the fresh making the
rivalry score 8'2-5‘2.

may expect to take at State and the
type of faculty and student mem-
bers he will come in contact with:
these are a few of the topics on
which the members of the commit-
tee will enlighten the high school
students when they meet them in
their geographical groups. The road

Vote on Big Ten Motion
To Assembly Today

After an absence of nearly four
years, Dr. Harold W. Thompson,
former Professor of English and
vibrant State personality, will return
to speak before the student body at
the request of Signum Laudis in
today’s Assembly. The remaining
items of business on the program
will be the reading of the names of
the newly-elected Signum Laudis
members by Dr. John M. Sayles,
President of the College, and voting
on the Big Ten motion which was
tabled until this week.

Twenty Years at State

Dr. Thompson or “Dr. Tommy" as
he was affectionately referred to by
students and faculty is one of the
legends in State College history. For
more than twenty years. Dr. Thomp-
son was one of the most beloved
teachers at State. His history is
briefly and factually summarized in
Who’s Who in America, giving his
birthplace as Buffalo, New York,
1891. In 1912, he obtained his Ph. B.
at Hamilton College, his A. M. at
Harvard in 1913, and his Ph. D. at
Harvard in 1915. In addition to
his other honors, he is a Fellow of
the Guggenheim Foundation, and
the recipient of numerous honorary
degrees including those from Edin-
burgh University, Union Coilege and
others.

What Who’s Who in America can-
not describe can best be supplied by
the professors and students who have
known him. Dr. Thompson was
specifically listed in the catalogue
as “Harold William Thompson, Pro-
fessor in English,” but in substance
he was the founder of the Music
Department at State and managed
to find time to be its music director
from 1920-24. A man of many diver-
sified talents, Dr. Thompson is also
an outstanding critic of church and
organ music.

Authority on Folklore

“Dr. Tommy" of Body, Boots, and
Brilches reknown, has by this pio-
neer work in folklore, made the world
and State students aware of this
territory's background and lore. Dr.
Thompson is the author of several
other books on folklore among which
was “Anecdotes and Egotisms of
Henry Mackenzie" (1928) which
became one of the greatest contri-
butions to Scottish literary scholar-
ships coming from any American
author. Also included in this exten-
sive literary repertoire are “A Scot-
iish Man of Feeling" (1931), editor
of Robert Coffin’s Last of the
"Logan" (1941).

Dr. Thompson, formerly a summer
school instructor in Cornell, left in
1940, to become a Professor of Eng-
lish and American Literature of
Cornell Univcrsily in Ithaca, where
he is touching at present. Signum
Luudis expressed a desire that the
faculty nu-mbcrs be invited to the
assembly to hear Dr. 'l‘hompson's
address.
