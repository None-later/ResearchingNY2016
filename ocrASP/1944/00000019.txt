Oil We Go—

'l‘his, State College, is a breathing space. There
will he, to be trite, one more storm a final cata-
clysmic gasp on the part of the already gasping
Senior class, accompanied by the inournfully joyous
sigh of Moving-i'p llay and concluded by the death
rattle of graduation.

hit forgive us, we become facetious. Somehow,
this seems to be the oiily possible note to sound, for
we are Seniors. Behind us is a growing w -ariness,
bred in the melting pot of politics and that great
institution, the extra-curricular. We are tired. and
so we gripe. But ahead of us is the time when we
will no longer be tired of it all, and then we shall
be sorry.

For we, in spite of our groans and grumbles, have
loved State College. We have seen our Alma Mater
in pre-war days, when we danced and dated: we
have seen the transition, painful stretching to the
realization that the indefinable something that
meant State to us was gone, for us, forever. And
now, at last, we have seen a new State emerge from
what seemed hopeless remnants.

Those who have never known the State we loved
have found much in this new college that has never
lost its strangeness for us. We have felt sorry for
them, but our pity has fallen on unresponsive
shoulders. This we have not fully understood; it
will be a sad day when we do finally understand
that the yearling classes are reasonably content.
For then, it seems, the appellation “lost generation"
will cloak its only too aptly.

The things we knew are gone: this is a deadening
reality, an easy phrase that falls meaninglesst frotu
so many lips. lint, for us, it cannot be said that
they existed iii vain. A hundred lost details haVc
integrated themselves into our personalities, our
own philosophies of life: they reveal themselves
daily in every action, every gesttirc, every thought.

it is hard to say what Wt‘ mean. and yet We feel
that we have much to say odd fragments of sense
and nonsense that will make their how on this page
sometime before the final swan song. This is a
prelude, a prefate to some yet unknown toiit'lusioii.

STATE COLLEGE NEWS, FRIDAY, MARCH 24, 1944

some CCLLEGE NEWS 3W“ Paqclwcled

 

Well, at last, at long last. comes
a modulated criticism-——the last
plays of the AD season made a
satisfying evening on the whole.
Cheers! I can be my own sweet
self.

The first play concerned itself
with the famed Alcott family, given
to the young in heart forever in the
book, Little Women.

Unfortunately, the play is badly
t'xri'ten, extremely badly. The
warmth of the book is lacking.
But on the whole 7 the play turned
out rather well. It was refreshing,
to use an overworked word, and
reached its climax with the wonder-
ful Christmas play, as Baxter stood
on a chair those famous legs envel-
oped in pnntaloons and made with
all four gestures. Quelle wonderful.
I laughed myself ill.

Baxter was the stand-out in this
play, looking cute as a bug's ear in
pantaloons and hoop-skirt. The
scene with Fred Shoemaker, who
played Laurie, where the two folded
blankets, and Janet got coy when
their hands touched, was the best
bit of business in the play. if forgot
to add that Baxter was Amyi.

Putnam was Mrs. March, and in
attempting to be calm. and quiet,
lost some projection, I say, stating
it clumsily. There is such a thing
as itiidcr-under-playing, and i
think that’s what happened. Bren-
iiig did a strong .10, biit unfortun-
ately, one remembers the coltish
and somewhat beautiful Hepburn in
the part. The rest. of the mat was
adequatemand the play turned otit
to be a restful period piece. Con-
grats to Kippy, my revered fellow
columnist, for not burlesquing it,
and keeping a sweetness, that’s the

only word, in the staging and inter-
pretation.

The second play, directed by Irene
Heck, was definitely one of the
stand-out productions of this year
of AD. Concerning itself with the
French Revolution, it managed to
be completely convincing, and cer-
tainly there was the best stagcful
of characters that's been assembled
this year to joy the heart of an
embittered old critic. Martha Joyce
and Ruth Schmitt were completely
harrowing as "searchers," looking
for aristoc'ats. Miriam Quinlan
was porcelain-like in her interpre-
tation of the aristocrat, disguised as
it Breton peasant, who is almost (lis-
eovercd. ’l‘eddy Fine did it whee of
it eharactcrization as the mad young
girl. dashing in and out of doors.
and cowering in corners. But 'l‘cddy
seems to be able to do any sort of
a part with the conviction of :
professional. I liked Mnlcahy as
the embittered young girl, who fears
her Republican fiancee will betray
the aristocrat she is protecting.
And Kenny was at her best as the
old peasant.

The plot is too tangled to explain
here, but. a fine feeling of suspense
was built tip through the scene. and
the alternation of screaming scenes
of accusation, with quiet scenes of
fear and terror, was most effective,
i stayed on the edge of my seat
till the final curtain.

Stage craft should be congratu-
latcd for both sets, and whoever
thought up the music in the second
play to denote the passing of the
tumbrils was clever. i imagine Miss
lleck should be congratulated for
that.

it. was a good ending to a season
that wasn't exactly sensational.

What is the matter with Myskania and the full-

that are being broken every day, :iiid I think it's about
time someone put the practice to an end.

Freshmen are supposed to comply with these tradi-
tions, and yet I have seen many of them tunfortunately.
I do not know their names: wearing high school rings.
athletic letters. and high school sweaters. I had to
l'orego the above privileges when 1 His :1 "verdant

good many people consider tradition a lot of hog—wish.
but the majority says tradition is here to stay. it the
present freshman class is too ill-natured to stick to
the rules of the game. and their rival class is too lll-
dolciit to see that the Gremlins bow down. why not
throw the whole mess back to the Indians?

let. me tell you something you would yell too if you tried to keep all
the soldiers in this man's army straight. that’s not bad enough

i got to chase people out. of the po every thursday morning of course
there is a sign otitsidc the door which coiiid not be any pliiiner that
they are supposed to keep out. but. they walk in anyway and look as
injured as anything when i kick them ottt putting oitt the news is a pain
in the neck without people standing around screaming about their prac-
tice teaching practice. teachers are subhunnm anyway there is something
about iiilliic which makes people go around tearing their hair but
i could not be any crazier illtlll them if i tried and i am trying hard right
now i am col-g nuts what. with all the sophomores running around hill.
1 'as iia'”.ig fun reading the old stutt- college news and i run across this
thing so i am putting this in my column i revolt against soldiers this
week maybe after i come. back i will have the courage to run all over
the college hunting up what. happened to my soldiers it is very difficult
nowadays to find out about all my spies have gone overseas but pretty
soon i will get more i hope
