Once upon a time there was a
very pretty little country. It was
not only a pretty little country, it
was a very democratic little coun-
try. It had been founded. after
much oratory and bloodshed. upon
the proposition that all men are
created equal.

The children of that country, like
the children of other countries, liked
to shoot sling-shots. Sling-shot
shooting was such an integral part
of the children’s development that
the wise men who ran the country
decided that a school he set up,
supported by the public funds, to
instruct promising young men and
women in the art of sling-shot whit-
tling. Since a poorly whittled sling-
shot might easily cause a child to
develop a warped attitude on things,
and indeed, might conceivably
wreck his life, great care was exert-
ed ln setting up this institution.

. . . . a more perfect union

Said the wise men: “we must not
only exert the greatest pains in
selecting outstanding students for
our school, we must give them the
best kind of training within our
power. We must have nice build-
ings and adequate grounds. We
must have the best professors
money can buy.” '

The wise men agreed to this
wholeheartedly and had the nice
buildings built and the grounds ac-
quired. The best professors that
money could buy were bought. Stu-
dents were selected from large
numbers of applicants.

. . . establish Justice

Then the wise men had another
inspiration. ‘

“This is not enough,” they said.
“Since we are training these people
to be sling-shot whittlers in ‘a
country based upon the democratic
ideal and the proposition that all
men are created equal. we should
let them set up their own little
society at the school and thus edu-
cate them to hold the important
position of s.s.w. in the country at
large. We must, in short, educate
them for life. Yes, that's itwwe
must educate them for life."

. (lomcslic Irdiiquili/i/

And so the embryo s.s.w's were
encouraged to set up a student so-
ciety and develop the habits that
would fit them for life in a demo-
cratic and all-men-are-equal coun-
try.
They set up little groups based
upon religious and racial differ-
ences. The people discriminated
against by one group didn't seem to
mind at all; they set up little groups
of their own which said "so-there"
to the other groups. Of course
some good friendships were broken
up by this system, but that was
considered a small price to pay for
such fundamental prejudices.

. . . . lll(‘ common dcjrnsr

These little groups soon learned
to form political parties and make
little deals with each other and to
always vote for their own candidate.
regardless of his qualifications for
the office. They also were adept
at getting their members to he
heads of various organizations.

KD,ChiSi9, Sayles, Psi Gam
ln Four-Way Tie For Lead

Sayles Irounces KD,
Lose Contest To Rates

As a result of this week’s series
of upsets, the WAA basketball league
is tied up with KD, Sayles Hall.
Psi Gain and Chi Sig vieing for first
place with two losses each. At the
beginning of the week Sayles and
KD were leading. each having lost
one game. The defeat of KD by
Sayles put them on top, but in one
of the major upsets of the year the
Rares eked out a two point win over
the Saylesmen to deposit them in the
twice beaten column along with KD,
Chi Sig and Psi Gain.

Bares Upset Sayles

The Sayles-Rares game was a fast
rough affair. The game got off to
a fast start but considering the
amount of action there was not too
much scoring, as the 18-16 tally in-
dicates. Daly of Sayles deserves
credit for her spirit and endurance.

KD, in another of their overtime
games, finally gained a one point
win over BZ. From the opening
whistle it seemed to be BZ’s game
with KD trailing all the way. With
a desperate burst of scoring, in the
fourth quarter, the Western Avenue
squad fought its way back into the
running and the game ended at 27
all. The first overtime period also
ended in a tie. each team scoring
once. In the second period. KD net-
ted four points to BZ’s three to win
33-32.

Newman Hall played twice this
week. In neither game did they
show the ability displayed earlier
against KD and Sayles. The game
with BZ saw BZ's guards holding
Maggio and Slack down successfully.
LaSalle turned in an excellent job,
totaling up 18 points for BZ. The
Psi Gain—Newman contest was a
close one. with Psi Gam trailing for
three quarters and then coming
through in the final period to win
29-24. Giavelli sparked her team
piling up 20 points, twelve of which
were gained in the exciting last
quarter.

Sayles ’l‘ops Kl)

The action in the Sayles Hall—KD
game was not as fast or rough as a
game of such importance might have
been. Each team was wary of the
other and it reflected in their play—
ing. After the first quarter, therc
was not too much hope for KD.
The forwards put up a stiff fight
but the Saylcs guards were always
there. The game ended in a 26—16
win for Sayles.
the country wasn‘t really demo-
cratic, they set up a mysterious
group called Paranoia at the head
of the student government. The fact
that some things ale above criticism
and beyond the comprehension of
the lay mind was considered a good
thing for the students to know.

All in all. the students lcnrncd :ill
thc things necessary to life in a
democratic. and idealistic socicty.
And so they were t'tlllcutcd for lifc.

State Team Defeated

In Final Fencing Fracas

On last Saturday morning the
women’s fencing squad engaged in
the second and final match of the
season with a Well coordinated team
from the LaSalle Institute at Troy.
The LaSalle men won the match
by a score of 16-10.

Despite the fact that the State
team was defeated, the contest gave
them a good deal of experience in
competitive fencing and an oppor-
tunity to improve their technique.

This match brought the unusually
short fencing tournament to a close.
Peg Bostwick. captain, has announ-
ced that several women have merited
WAA credit for fencing. Those who
have completed the number of hours
necessary for obtaining the credit
are: Chuck Axelrod. Carolyn Berg,
Peg Bostwick, Mary Carey, Helen
Cisek, Trudy Kasper, and Fran Mc-

As Men Pursue Their Rivals

by I TOLD YOU SO!

Last Friday night the men's bas-
ketball team scored a run-away 63-
21 victory over a hopelessly out-
classed girl team. The girls did have
the lead at one time, they scored the
first basket of the game. From that
point on it was merely a question of
how high the score would go.

The first half was played under
girl’s rules and it was expeced that
the women would make a better
showing than they did.

Easy Day

The fact that the girls were lucky
enough to score the first basket
seemed to act as a starter for the
men. They waltzed by the guards
and stink basket after basket. By the
end of the quarter the tally stood at
18-5 in favor of the men, and the
half time score was 37-15.

The third quarter was a complete
rout with the girls on the receiving
end. They were helpless to stop the
feints and fast dribbles of the hard—
charging males. Several times Dick-
inson went the length of the floor
without a serious attempt to stop
him. The third quarter found the
men tickling the lwinc for 21 points.
The best the girls could do was two.
’l‘lirce’s Enough

In the fourth and last quarter the
guys had a stroke of pity. Instead
of playing the conventional five.
manager Phil Lashinsky sent out
only three. With this advantage the
girls scored only four points to five
for the men. This brought the score
tip to the final count of 63-21.

High scoring honors fo" the men
went in Dickinson with 15. The best
for the girls was seven by Mary
Seymour.

-by AN UNPREJUIHCED FEMALE-

In a well-fought, hotly contested
etc. basketball game last Friday. the
unbelievable happened. The women
of State lost their FIRST game of
the entire season to the men of
State.

It is rumored that the only rea-
son the fellows managed to conquer
was the fact that they were allowed
to play with only three men against
five girls. Formerly. they had been
tripping all over themselves but with
the smaller team they had less
trouble.

It was evident even to an un-
informed spectator that the girls for
outclassed their opponents. The
score may be explained by the fact
that perhaps the girls were flusl.ered
by the presence of so much mas-
culine pulchrilude and their usually
eagle-like eyes found more intcrcst-
ing subjects.

Forbidden Fragrance

’Tis rumored that one of the girls
applied a few drops of Suivcz—mol
beforehand. Unforlumuely. they
did. Perhaps a little Tubu might have
been more effective, if it liycd up to
its name i'athci‘ than its advcrlisc-
nicnts.

operation was amazing.

It has been shown that the girls
came out on top in class, elusivcncss,
allurc, form and co-opcralion. The
only point the men topped them in
was the score. Our conclusion is that
the girls were the intellectual, moral
and aesthetic viclors. How do the
men darc hold tip their heads under
the stigma of it all? For shnmcl!

Margo Byrne

We want to bring a new tradition
to WAA, this being the season to‘
make or break traditions, (see Web-
ster’s Collegiate and weep). Any—
way to keep Myskania from being
needlessly booted about, we suggest
an annual egg rolling to relieve pent
up feeling.

Scrambled Two

Every Spring when the grounds in
front of Page have solified to the
point where they will not completely
absorb the eggs, a merry band of
young people might gather and with
shouts of happy laughter. kick hen
fruit from there to her. It would
be as sensible as anything that has
been going on around here lately,
anyway.

There are a few burning issues
facing the student body of which
said body doesn’t seem to be proper-
ly aware. From them a tense. grip-
ing sports opera might be developed.

Characters:

Pearl Button; a gay young soph-
omore in straitened circumstances.
Major. bridal paths.

Patty Kake; resident of Farrell
House. plagued by o'er-leaping am-
bition.

Rhoda Letter; gallant, valiant
junior, facing life with a smile. Of
course. this is just a foundation. The
usual complications, ramifications
and family connections would be
worked out in time and—space. The
prevailing mood would be tragic.
Trouble would rear its curly head at
every turn and there would be plenty
of turns.

But. back to the burning issues.
Will Farrell win a basketball game?
Will WAA have a sleighride this
year? Will the tennis tournament;
be finished this Spring? Will them
what has credit in riding get their
five bucks back?

Perils face Patty, Pearl and Rhoda.
Pearl will have to hitch-hike home
if WAA doesn't cough up her fin.
Miss Shorday is going to give Patty
an extra helping of dcsscrt if Farrell
ever wins a game, and Patty's hun-
gry soul sure cruvcs that extra little
lid—hit. lilioda needs some diver-
sion to help her keep 1.. her valiant
gallantry. Hence the life and death

interest in the tciniis tournament.

And so, children. will Patty‘s boy—
friend's cruel stepmother let him go
on the sleighrid if there is one?

SOph "Big lenll
ls PoignoniSlory
:93: To Music

by Joan Berberieh

" ’Tlll We Meet Again . . . "

A girl and a boy in love—a trench
and a hurtling bombshell—blackouts
and thousands of miles of ocean—
State then . . . and now . . .

In an attempt to sidestep the slap-
stick comedy acts of former months.
the Sophomore class is presenting as
its “Big Ten” a musical in seven
scenes~scenes that touch both the
poignantly sad and the gloriously
happy memories of State as the
servicemen knew it before the war.
This musical which will be held in
Page Hall on April 29 at 8:15 PM.
will be composed of the most beauti-
ful and reminiscent songs of the
past few years.

After the reading of the dedication
by Arlene Polsky, the first scene,
“All the Things You Are,” will begin
the evening's performance. “Eni-
braceablc You,” Scene 111 is a highly
amusing anecdote of State College
life in 1944. Both Dr. J. Allan Hicks,
Professor of Education and a young-
ster from Milne will aid the Sopho—
more cast in this scene.

The beloved blackfacc chorus will
frolic gully through scene IV. on-
titled "Rufus Rastus Johnson
Brown" for this is the scene wherein
much of the rich humor of the
musical is concentrated.

Just as most college girls have a
theme song all their own—a song
that causes lonely tears and heart-
break whcn the man she loves is
overseas—so “My Shining Hour" be-
e..mes the theme song of the young
and very real heroine.

But it isn't until the sixth scene
that the climax is reached when
Agnes Young. soloist, sings " 'Til We
Meet. Again." the song around which
the musical hos grown. As a fitting
ending for a musical that inspires
delight, humour, and reverence, the
chorus will sing “Holy, Holy, Holy
as the lighting changes and the cur-
tain closcs on what could well be
called the first college opcrctta that
has been written in Amcrica!

Intricate bullet arram.acments.
chorus harmony and expert han-
dling of lights. props, sclling. etc.
have been carefully developed dur-
ing the past two months at intensive
practicr scssions by the fifty—five
man cast. all of whom are Sopho-
mores. ’I‘hc sccncs are closely knit
togclhcr by a common lhcmc which
winds its way throuin lhc cnlirc
musical. Participating soloists arc
Flo Conca. Suc Yugcr, and Agnes
Young.

Tickets of ndi‘nission arc 35 cents
for studcnls and 50 ccnls for the
gcncrnl public.

Angna Enters, Mime, Guest of D & A, Hastings Reports

TO Dance In

by Marion Buetow

Angna Enters, the mime who has
made the dance a mirror of human
experience, will present her “Epi—
sodes and Compositions in Dance
Form" tomorrow at 8:30 P.M. on
the Page Hall stage, sponsored by
Drumatics and Arts Council.

Miss Enters began her theatrical
career in 1926 in New York's Green-
wich Village 'I‘heatre, introducing
her now-famous Modernist inter-
pretation of the dance. Two years
later she made a successful London
debut, followed by a transcontinent-
al tour and a triumphant. appear-
ance in Paris. Acclaimed by such
august critics as Paul Rosenfield,
Louis Untermeyer, and Gilbert
Seldes, today she is one of the most
vital and interesting personalities
on the stage.

Her dances are far from the con-
ventional theme; she projects her
creations by a theater composite
of sculpture, painting, mime, and
movement. Miss Enters allows her-
self but two limitations, which she
constantly keeps in mind: Pluto's.
“The beautiful movement is that
which produces the desired effect
with the least effort." and her own

credo, “Dancing is a composition

Summer Sessions
Begin July 5

The 1944 summer session, lasting
for a period of six weeks, will begin
July 5 and conclude August: 16. This
scssion is not connected with the
acceleialcd program being offered
to freshmen and Sophomores.

As in previous programs. the suin-
incr session will be available to
undergraduates who wish to lighten
their college program, although if
is planned primarily for the Senior
and graduate students. Service to
teachers and other educational
workers will be the chief concern
of the summer session of 1944.

The session is planned to meet
the needs of secondary school teach-
crs who hold the 10-ycai' provisional
[caching license or the war-timc
temporary certificate and wish to
qualify for a pernmncnl teaching
certificate. It will also be of interest
to holders of the Bachelor of Edn—
