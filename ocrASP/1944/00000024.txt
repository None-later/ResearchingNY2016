Bert Kiley

The soldier hunched his shoulders
against the rain. His toes curled
unconsciously against the cold damp»
ness seeping through his sodden
boots. It seemed that he had been
forever on that hill, crouching in
the mud behind a wall that had
once been a terraced farm. The
Germans were spasmodically send-
ing over a few shells. He would hear
the whee-ee and fall into the fox-
hole he had dug by the wall. Some-
times the explosions pelted him with
mud.

There hadn’t been any shells over
for quite a while. Over to the right,
he could hear the mortars rhythm-
ically crunching away. An airplane
roared low overhead. Looking up, he
saw the eternal grey and smudgy
black of the rain clouds. Absently.
he began to hum. He sang softly
an old half-forgotten tune. . . .

“Somewhere over the rainbow, way
up high . . ."

A glow came slowly over him. The
muscles. tense from the strain and
cold relaxed.

“ . . . there’s a land that I dreamed
of, once in a lullaby . . . "

The pencil of memory flicked over
his brain cells. back to the summer
of 1939. He was sitting in front of
his tent; the sun was sinking behind
a. row of pines to the west, salmon
clouds stretching delicate threads
across the sky; from the portable
radio came the voices of Fred
Waring’s Glee Club singing . . . .
“Somewhere over the rainbow, blue-
birds fly . . . ”

Somehow the peace of the scene
reached out through the chemistry
of the old melody reacting on his
memory. He saw again the lake in
the warm, almost palpable calm of
sundown. He saw the little white
triangles of the sailboats slowly
weaving far up the lake. He heard
the mournful “quawk” of a flight of
herons as they swung along in the
gloom of the western range of hills.

1939—just before the war started——
a convertible purring along a country
road, the gang that used to go on
the hot dog roasts, the steady thump
of the waves against the hull of his
speed-boat. He smiled and contin-
ued humming, lost in the nostalgia
of the revery.

He didn't hear the warning
whistle. The explosion tore up the
wall about ten feet from him. A fly-
ing brick struck him in the face . . .

He lay in a hospital. His shattered
nose no longer pained him. but a
heavy ache in the back of his head
throbde steadily.

“That lousy song—" he thought.
"Well I suppose I can‘t blame it on
the song. It was just plain foolish—
ness to be day dreaming with Jerry
throwing shells at. Inc . . . Well, I
guess that’s what happens when
you go moping around dreaming of
a jolly little past. Maybe if I'd been
fighting then like I am now it. would
never have got Inc. I guess We‘re
going to have to keep lighting in one
way or another on this pebble. I
wonder how much I could get for
that Chris-Craft? . .

Want To Take A Chance?
Umpire The Game Sunday

Next Sunday afternoon the
.Dorm field will be the scene of
a world-shaking event. Jarrin’
John Coulter, '47, of Newton
Hook, is bringing his Coulter
Athletic Club en masse to Al-
bany with the intention of play-
ing softball. In reply to his
high-handed challenge Bob
Dickinson has corralled a goodly
collection of players to oppose
the J.C. A.C. aggregation.

This game is the first of what
might well turn into a first-
rate blood feud. All the players
on the State team have quick
tempers that could flare at any
time. To prevent spike wounds
all players are requested to wear
sneakers.

 

 

 

Maiors Open,-
Pitching Glitters

by George W. Hess

For the boys in service; men who
can’t get (my other paper.

With line-ups that looked like
they had come straight out of some
class D league, fourteen major
league teams swung into their third
war-time season. Tuesday was
opening day and about the biggest
surprise was the fine brand of play
in both the National and American
loops. Cleveland and Chicago were
frozen out.

The games were all extremely well
pitched, even if it was opening day.
In the National the Giants gave
notice that they were much im-
proved over the tail-end club of last
year. They played Boston and won
2-1. The Brooklyn Dodgers appear
to have no batting punch and were
subdued by the recently christened
Philadelphia Blue Jays. Chicago
and St. Louis shut-out Cincinnati
and Pitsburgh respectively. Bucky
Walters, pitching for the Reds, had
exceedingly tough luck. He gave
the Cubs only three hits, but each of
these were turned into a run and
he lost 3-0.

In the American the Yankees
seemed to disbelieve the fact that
they have a poor team and proceed-
ed to hang a 3-0 white-washing on
the Boston Red Sox. Here again it
was hurling that grabbed the spot-
light with l-lank Borowy furnishing
a superb five hit effort for the
Yankees. The St. Louis Browns
stopped the Detroit Tigers 2-1 and
the Philadelphia A's clipped the
Washington Senators 3-2 in 12
innings.

Spring I944--We Hang From
Subway Straps As Snow Swirls

Boy-o-boy, we said gleefully, as
we planned our Spring vacation in
the best sports’ page tradition. Vi-
sions of long hikes, bicycle rides,
picnics, and other healthy outdoor
activities danced before our eyes.

50, bright and early our first
morning home, we donned our
snow-suit, ear-muffs and fur-lined
stadium boots and armed with a
determined look set out to indulge
in some Spring sports.

After building two rather puny
snowmen we retired to our hot-
water bottles and lemonade for sev-
eral days.

Our first attempt at a picnic re-
sulted in a dismal failure. Our
sandwiches froze solid and even the
ants wisely remained in hibernation.

However, we have one accomp-
lishment of which we are justly
proud. We went through the sub-
ways at four o’clock on a Sunday
afternoonll And we have the brok-
en bones to prove it. Recalling that

Chi Sig, KD, Saylesmen
Rank In Tie For Lead

In the first of the play-offs for
the basketball league championship
Chi Sig defeated KD, 25a11. Chi Sig
scored first and never lost the lead.
The passwork and guarding of the
Madison Avenue squad proved the
downfall of the KD team.

Chi Sig defeated Psi Gam, 29-15,
to eliminate them from competition
for first place in the basketball
league. The game was fast and
rough. Chi Sig scored first and for
the first two quarters the game was
all theirs. Psi Gam rallied in the
second half but it was too late to
catch the Madison Avenue squad.

Sayles finished up its schedule
successfully by winning over Phi
Delt, 28-20. Phi Delt put up a stiff
fight but the superior passwork and
guarding of Sayles counted in the
end. Bruenig and O'Grady share
honors for Sayles with 12 points
each while Seymour was the guiding
light of the Phi Delis.

New Yorkers are noted for their
sense of humor, we muttered in best
Reader’s Digest style, to one of the
13 people standing on our left foot,
"Pardon me, is my rib crushing your
elbow?" Well, maybe he was from
New Jersey.

We have not given up all hope of
Spring, though. In fact, we're down
to only two sweaters under our win-
ter coat now.

Notwithstanding our miserable
showing we hear rumors that lots
of people were really energetic dur-
ing their vacation. One girl played
a tremendous game of badminton.
Another person (one of the Sports’
Dept.'s ablest members) played some
fast and furious card games. We
have decided after taking a careful
census that the following are the
most popular of the Spring sports:
sleeping, eating and long rides, pre-
ferably in maroon convertibles, rank
highest in that order.

Phi Dell Captures Title
In WAA Pin Tourney

The 1944 WAA bowling tourney
has been completed and the Phi
Delt are the new champions, with
Psi Gam as runner—up and Chi Sig
in third place. The season was a
successful one. with seven of the
original ten teams completing their
matches,

The standings of the teams and
total pinnage is as follows:

WAA Reveals
Spring Program

WAA has recently announced a
tentative program for the spring
season. Softball will undoubtedly be
the highlight of the schedule. This
year. due to a shorter spring sea-
son the usual league will not be
formed. Instead, contests will be
held among the four classes. In
this series the Soph-Frosh rivalry
game will be contested. Rivalry
races are scheduled for the Wed-
nesday before Moving-Up Day.

Tennis is next in importance on
the program but will not get into
full swing until sometime in the
middle of May when the courts will
be opened.

Riding, the outstanding feature
of last year's program, will once
more have an important place on
the spring schedule. Providing that
the weather continues to be pleas-
ant, riding classes will start on Sat-
urday.

Last year golf was offered as a
new spring sport but little interest
was displayed. Mike Buetow has
been appointed captain and is now
trying to obtain the use of the Mu-
nicipal Golf course at a reduced
rate or better still—free of charge!

Bike riding is being initiated as a
spring sport and is under the super-
vision of Helen Jennings and Lu-
cille Kenny.

Archery. badminton, hiking and
volley ball complete the sports cal-
endar for the coming season but
will not get under way until the
weather permits participation out
of doors.

Speaker, Voting,
Business; Slated

For Assembly
Hillel Presents Rabbi;

Elections Share Program

In accordance with its policy of
extending its activities to benefit
the entire student body, Hillel will
present in today’s assembly Rabbi
Levi Olan who will discuss "Disci-
plines of Freedom. Ada Snyder. '44,
President of Hillel, will introduce
the speaker. An important business
meeting will follow.

The first amendment in the busi-
ness meeting to be presented by the
Board of Audit and Control will
strike out “b” of Article 9, Section
1, of the Student Association Con-
stitution which reads “The Board of
Audit and Control shall prevent the
transfer of funds by any organiza-
tion from one line of its budget to
another. The Board shall also pre-
vent the transfer of funds from one
organization to another," to read
“The transfer of funds by any or-
ganization from one line of its budget
to another or from one organization
to another shall not be permitted
except with the approval of BAC.

This change will aid all the college
organizations who formerly had to
receive approval from Student Asso-
ciation when the amount allowed in
their line budgets was exceeded.
Student Association business will be
alleviated since every financial item
of any organization will not have to
be presented for the students' vote.

A financial amendment proposed
last week will request 75 dollars for
Student Council keys. The enlarged
Council will demand more money
for its operation, as Miss Latimcr
stated.

Marjorie Brcunig. ‘44, Grand Mar-
shal, will read and explain the
Moving-Up Day procedure.

At the conclusion of assembly. stu-
dents will cast their ballots for
Student Association and class offi-
cers. Students Inust have paid their
student. tax and class dues to vote in
both elections.

Absentee Voting Deadline
Set For 4:30 P. M. Today

Absentee voting for all stu-
dents who will be unable to at—
tend this morning’s assembly
will be conducted between 12
noon and 4:30 P.M. today at a
table in the lower hall of Draper.
This will be the last opportunity
for absentees to cast votes for
Student Association and class
officers.

Student teachers who conduct
classes during the assembly
period may vote any time before
4:30 P.M.

In past elections, absentee bal-
lots required the signature of
the Dean or college physician,
but it was felt this semester that
the voter’s signature on the bal-
lot will suffice.

centralize and put over our activi-
ties?

3. Let's find out what other col-
leges are (loing-v—let people know
about: us talk about ourselves. Sell
State!

(is Goldberger

A determined program to have
State assume the role of leader in
liberal thought, for being a com-
posite of future teachers, it should
be right now!

A welcome to constructive criti-
eism.

What 1 should expect from you:

Active thought on all issues your
government sponsors.

Barbara l'utniun:

My idea concerning the purpose of
govrcnmcnt are stated quite COlll-
pletcly in the Prcumble to the Con—
stitution. in applying them to State
