Strictly Social

by Betty O’Neil

The little things about State are
what make the big things big, make
State more than a school of atl-
vanced learning. The success of
State's grads has been due to the
social progrm as much as to the
intense scholastic training.

Despite the war, or perhaps be-
cause of the war, social life at State
has been particularly spirited this
year. As a unit, the student body
has succeeded in making the Big
Ten something to be not—too- soon
forgotten.

This year is not the first time
State has sponsored strictly femin-
ine dances. On December 18, 1918,
the Junior class sponsored a party
promising men. and men they had“
8 or 10.

Comparable to the Intersorority
I-Iop, at which there were actually
men presentmenough too, was the
Battalion Dance and Company Ball
in 1918, marking the cessation of
Army Activities at State College.
No doubt the women were in gootl
form from the dancing classes of
1016, conducted with the purpose of
teaching students to be "good con—
servative dancers."

Social life at State has been some-
what stifled for students by Resi-
dcncc Council rules, but way back
in 1018, women were allowed to
entertain men three evenings a
week, provided it was in the par-
lot' with it chapcron nearby and the
men were ottt at 10:30 PM.

\Vc may have lost otir formal
dances, bttt cvrn a war -an't pre—
vent the bttll sessions, dancing in
the Commons, lunches at the Bold,
atttl the growing pep anti spirit iit
rivalry. Il‘s lltc lilllc lltt’ity/s Ilttil

Along. The Way

by Colller and Dube

Besides learning Avagardo's law,
theorem XXXVI, and that Carl
Sandburg is a poet, there is some-
thing morc that the Alums of State
College will always remember. There
is that “extra something” that they
picked up along the way—the cul-
ture that they acquired, not through
books and Profs alone, not neces-
sarily through the sidelines of col-
lege life—but through the choral
singing of the Don Cossacks, the
sculptttring of Madame Silvercrups,
the monologues of Cornelia Otis
Skinner, th lectures by famous per-
sonages such as Lous Untermcycr
and Mady Christians.

Lunch at the Boul or learning
dance routines is obviously easily
arranged, btit bringing leading cele-
breties to State each year is not
quite so simple. For just this ptir~
pose, we have here such organiza-
tions as Dramatics and Art Council
and Music Council.

It was Music Council that brought
to State this year the famous opera
singer and radio star, the man who
boasts of perfect pronunciation in
five different languages Conrad
’I‘hibttult.

She threw roses at Bob Hope!
This is one of the novel character-
istics of Emily Kimbrough, co-
author with Cornelia Otis Skinner
of Our Hctti'ls Wci'c Young tntd Guy,
who came to State through the
courtesy of SCA.

One of the many culture contri-
buting activities of Drzinttttics illltl
Art Cottiicil this year was bringittg
Angtta lCntcrs, .‘llllt‘tl by the Mac
l’fll'ft‘t‘l, “The First Mime of ()ur

STATE COLLEGE ANI) FOUR WARS

It is only fitting that we pause on the occasion of
State’s hundredth anniversary to reflect on State in
the three wars which have preceded this one.

CIVIL WAR

In 1861 under the leadership of Professors Kimball
and Huested, 179 men formed the 44th New York
Volunteers. These men fought many battles and won
many medals for their valour. In the rotunda of
Draper Hall is a plaque celebrating the dead of these
men.

SPANISH-AMERICAN WAR

'I‘he Spanish-American VVttr occurred during State's
history bitt is given no mention in the annals of the
college.

WORLD WAR I

In the first World War a military company was
established at the college. The idctt was presented
by President Brubachcr and several tncn t'rom the
college enlisted. A "State College Signal Corps" was
organized under the direction of Dr. Brubachcr and
Dr. l-Ittle . . In June 1017, the Srvru Connor: Nuws
published the names of Alfred Dcdickc, l'ormcr editor
of the NEWS and Edward Potter, for whom Potter
Club was named, as serving in the Officer's Reserve
Corps at Madison Barracks . . . In November 1017. the
college was urged to contribute to the Friendship \\'ttr
lt‘und ttntlcr the sponsorship of the Y.i\’l.(:.t\., since "it
is the. only organization working today it] all the
Allied Nations" latter in the saute mouth the
college heard an address by Dorothy ’l‘rcal Arnold
who hitd been at the frottt. Said Miss Arnold “'l‘i:c

In the one hundred years that

account was presented in the year-
book. ’l‘he program lasted about two
hours, beginning at ll A.M. with
addresses by the President of the
College and the President of the
Senior Class: college songs were
sung, the classes movctl tip, and
then marched outdoors
