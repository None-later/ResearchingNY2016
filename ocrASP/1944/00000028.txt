State College—Past, Present, Future

Faculty Remembers Days Milne School
0‘ Fewer Men, Activities To Commemorate

We fear it would be indiscreet to
disclose the name of the faculty
member who has taught here at
State for the longest time. Besides.
we dislike being sued for libel.
However. we did interview several
professors who probed back in their
memories to tell us a few changes
that have taken place since their
arrival.

Room 203 is foremost in the mind
of Dr. Ellen C. Stokes. Dean of
Women. because all the members of
the Mathematics Department and
the History Department Were once
crowded into that one room. When
Miss Stokes first came to State. the
Library was the auditorium. and the
Commons was the gymnasium.

There were no dorms. but since
then several halls have been built.
“The Alumni Residence Halls."
says Miss Stokes. “draws the college
closer together. We have the Alum-
ni. Miss Pierce. and Dr. Sayles to
thank for these halls. Students of
today do not realize what a prob-
lem the question of dorms was. and
they should be very grateful to the
people who had foresight enough to
see the need for such buildings.“

In 1911. when many of our pres-
ent teachers came here. there were
few student activities of any kind.
Mr. Clarence Hidlcy. Assistant Pro-
fessor of History. says that coili-
pared to the present day. “extra
curricular life was as quiet as a
ccmctcry."

The student body of 1911 was
made up mostly of women. There

many memories of the first World
War.

Dr. Winfred Decker. Professor of
German. remembers the time when
there were less than 240 students.
many of whom came from smaller
towns. Albany. Schenectady. and
Troy were the large cities repre-
sented. Many of the girls were
daughters of ministers. lawyers,
doctors. and dentists. Most of the
students had exactly the same high
school preparation; and. therefore.
there was more uniformity in their
manner of study and learning.

When the Milne School was ex-
panded. there was more opportunity
for practice for the student teach-
ers. There was also more method-
ology in the "old days."

Dr. Beik feels that one of the fin-
est changes since his coming has
been the development of music aiid
drainatics. There is. of course. a
great. deal more freedom of activ-
ities today than in 1911.

(For Youth. and the State)

This year marks the 54th anniver-
sary of the Milne School and the
99th anniversary of the existence of
the practice school operated in con-
junction with the college now
known as New York State College
for Teachers. The laboratory or
experimental school has existed
since 1845. operated under various
names and establishing various
levels of scholastic work.

In 1890. when Normal School he-
came known as New York State
Normal College. the present Milne
was known as The High School De-
partment of the College. and retain-
ed the name until 1916. at which
time it became the \Villiam .I. Milne
High School. after Dr. Millie who
was President of the College fo' a
generation. It was under his admin-
istration that the old Normal school
\ 'as transformed to collegiate status.
When the Junior High grades were
added to Milne High School in 1920.
it became known as thc Millie
School. It was from this beginning
that the present Milne evolved.
High School in IBM)

In the 54 years of its existaiicc.
Milne has witnessed various loca-
tions. traditions. curriculunis and
a fairly steady increase in enroll-
lllt‘llt. ln I890. when a high school
was added to the practice school.
with Dr. William V. Jones as prin-
cipal. there were about 30 high
school pupils.

From \\'illct Strect. to Lancaster
and Lark streets. to the third floor
of Draper Hall. and finally. to Millie
Hall in 1929, Millie has become more
tiiid more a part of the college.
Juniors in college invaded the halls
of Millie for the first time in 1931.
Previous to that time. oiily Seniors
were allowed to teach in thc prac—
ticc school.

Signum Laudis Honors

Signuin Laudis. the scholastic
honor society of State College. will
be fourteen years old on May 23.

Plans for the fraternity. the pur-
pose ot' which is to encourage and
reward scholarship. were drafted in
1930 by a student-faculty commit-
tcc. aiid the constitution was drawn
and ratified by Student Association.
Facility members were Dr. Gertrude
E. Douglas. Assistant Professor of
Biology; Dr. Harold W. Thompson.
former Professor of English; and
Miss Elizabeth Van Dciiburgh. Reg-
istrai'.

For the first induction. the entire
imdcrgraduaic membership was ali-
noimccd on Senior Class Day. Dr.
A. It. Brubachcr. President of the
college. aiid Dr. William H. Mctzlel'.
Dean. were named the first two
honorary members of the organiza-
tion.

Signiiin Laiidis was formed as a
local scholastic honor group be-
.‘ansc Phi Beta Kappa. trying to
disperse their chapters more equal-
ly and thereby starting them in the
south alid west.

State F ormulates

Post-War Plans

Improvements liar SCT

Will Cost $400,000

A post-war construction program
having been presented for the
Teachers' Colleges of New York
State. definite plans are now being
formulated for the expansion of
State's campus. The total building
program as developed by the Re-
gents Board will cost approximately
$5,200,000.

The first appropriation of $400,-
000 for State College has been set
aside for a proposed commercial
education building. providing space
for a commerce department of 400
students together with classrooms
for other departments of the col-
lege. The present facilities are anti-
quated. allowing little room for the
expansion of enrollment in normal
times. The department now housed
on the third floor of Draper was
transferred from the State Normal
College at Plattsburg immediately
following the destruction of the
Plattsburg building by fire in 1929.
In normal times. the enrollment va-
ries between 225 and 300 students.
the college graduating each year
about. 60 students prepared to teach
commerce in the public schools.
New Administration Building

With the stun of $100,000 provid-
ed by the State. a new administra-
tion building will be constructed.
The administration oﬁices housed
in Draper Hall are not suitable for
office purposes and will be remodel-
ed to supply additional classrooms.
At present. property may be pur-
chased which will make aii excel-
lent site for a new administration
building.

Under the present auditorium. a
small gymnasium used by both men
and women students can not be
made to serve the needs of students
in physical fitness and recreation.
A new building at the cost of $300.-
000 will be erected on a site large
enough to provide suitable playing
fields.

Library Facilities Extended

$150,000 will be tiscd in an ex-
tension of the present library build-
ing. The library. remodeled from
the former chapel. consists of a.
large reading room with stack rooms
in the basement. The proposed 11—
brar.’ addition will house classrooms
for a library school of 200 students,
together with reading and study
rooms. and stack rooms for the stu—
dent body as a whole. The total
book capacity of the library aiid its
extension will not be less than 100.-
000 volumes.

’I‘bc purchase of additional prop-
crty will be provided in an appro—
priation of $250,000.

This state-wide post-war project
will present facilities for people re-
turning t'roni the armed forces aiid
adults released from production on
thc home iroiit who will have time
and need tor continued instruction.
