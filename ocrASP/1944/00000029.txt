State, Keeper of

Learns Story of '

Without traditions, a college is
merely a stark skeletal structure—
a mammoth creature without a heart
or soul. With traditions, it becomes
a living memory to be cherished and
loved—~to be remembered forever . . .

Tomorrow, the greatest tradition
of all will continue as the 29th
Myskania is tapped. The procedures
of Moving-Up and the singing of
“Where. on Where" are also tradi-
tion—one State wouldn't know how
to do without.

The hectic day of the Banner-
hunt. the field day contests, the
farce debate, the class skits and
class sings. the basketball and soft-
ball games, the uproarious cheering.
and finally the silver rivalry cup
are all traditions that are written
down in black and white to ascer-
tain their preservation.

Besides these. there are many little
traditions—traditions that may seem
small and insignificant to the on-
looker. but are really important in
maintaining a special feeling for
State among the student body. Some
of these are the traditions that
Myskania should march out of as-
sembly first. that freshmen might
not enter or leave the college by the
front door of Draper 01- Page Halls.
that deference should be paid by
freshmen to upperclassmen. that
there should be no cutting across the
lawn of the campus at any time. that
frosh should be required to know
“College of the Empire State" by
November 1. and that freshmen
should not wear high school insignia.
such as rings. pins, etc. Penalties
or violation of these traditions
seldom need to be administered as
most students respect them and
realize their importance.

There are other traditions also—
traditions that linger as beauty
lingers in after years. For twenty
years. the Senior on going out into
the wide, wide world on Moving-Up
Day have sung the “Great Fire"—a
song that might be better called a
hymn—a farewell hymn as the
Seniors wander into the night . . .
Recently a letter from Dorothy
Davidson Simonson. ’24. found its
way into the hands of Myskania.
This letter explains the Tradition of
“Great Fire." She writes:

"I wrote it for our class to sing
on the steps on the evening of
Moving-Up Day in 1924. our Senior
year. Martha Doody of our class
wrote the music.

“Because our class entered in 1920.
the terccntenary of the landing of
the Pilgrims at Plymotuh. the. lacul-
ty called us the Pilgrim class. When
I wrote the song. the name “pilgrim”
came to my mind. but I interpreted

it in a larger sense. that of a seeker
after an ideal, an inspiration, which
we found in our college. Like a
great fire. that inspiration burned
for us steadily. When we were about
to leave it forever. that fire of in-
spiration which it had been to us.
which was peculiarly ours and ours
alone. died down to embers. The
dream of its beauty went with us
into the outside world.

“So the College kindles anew for
each class . . . a fire of inspiration
which is peculiarly its own, the
memory of which it may cherish
throughout life.

“On Commencement Night. our
class marched out of the Campus
tearing torches, the first senior class
to do so. and singing “Great Fire.”

Yours sincerely.
Dorothy Davidson Simonson, '24

Stories just as mystic and full of
beauty lie behind Inost of the tradi-

Remember When—

. . . Wohelo. the Camp Fire Girl's
watchword was suggested for State
College girls by Dean Pierce?

. . . Attendance was compulsory
at the 8:30 chapel services every
Friday morning?

. . . In 1917. we had the first college
sing and "The Cannibal King" was
introduced for the first time?

. . . The freshmen women refused
to let their hair down (literallyi on
Moving-Up Day because it was un-
womanly?

. State women went “wild”
about the Suffrage victory?

. . . “Go fight for Freedom. War-
riors of the West!"

At last the world has spoken: Go!
Lay on for Liberty!“ rang out in the
corridors of State?

. . . Women started the movement
under Dean Anna Pierce for curtail-
ment of men‘s liberties and hours?

. . Class rivalry was organized
with Myskania in charge—Pipes and
mustachcs were tabooed among
underclassmen?

. . . O‘Mills Society—Banjo Orches-
tra furnished the music for the
class of 1920?

. . . Prohibition move was defiantly
upheld by students of State College?
"Let us join in the Movement and
gain in one of the greatest victories
of all times."

. . Slate women lamentcdv

In 1921 the college was granted
membership in the American Asso-
ciation of Universities. It was the
proposed plan 111' the Alumni Asso-
ciation for the erection of dormi-
tories that led to this action. Con-
timu-d endeavor in this line led
to the recognition of State College
dcgrccs for membership 111 the
American Association of University
Women in 19:11. However. it was
not until four years later that their
dreams were actually realized and
the cornerstone of Picrcc Hall was
laid. The Inosl recent step in 1111-
Iong range program was completed
with the dedication and opening of
Snylcs H1111 for men in 11141.

’l‘hcsc noteworthy accomplish-
ments were the result of the high

New Twist To Old Story

Is your man as handsome as
Gable? Can he sing like Sinatra?
Then sacrifice the picture on the

doesn’t have to jitterbug—maybe
he can’t even dance. and. as for
looks, anything short of Franken-
stein is accepted.

Of course you knew it long ago.
but now. all State will acknowl-
edge your Joe as the No. 1 “pin-
up.” He may be on the seven
seas; he may work in G.E.; or
he may dance with you in the
Commons every noon. “La bonne
chance" for everyone.

Rules for the contest will be
posted on the bulletin boards
around school. Place your Prince
Charming in the box provided in
