The student body of State College
gave to Florence Garfall the office
of President of Student Association
by an overwhelming vote cast in last
Friday‘s clcction. Iii defeating her
two opponents. Barbara Putnam and
Cccilc Goldbcrgcr. Miss Garl‘all
amassed over half the total number
of ballots cnsl. sky-l'ockcting far over
the established quota of 3'73 on the
first dislribuiion of votes.

Significant also. is the fact that
the number of sludcnts voting is
probably the greatest proportional
numbci' ever to participate in a
Student Association election. Seven
hundred and forty-five ballots wcrc
cost. This increase can be attributed
lo the revised voting syslcm that
went iillo effect last fall.

was prcvalenl as the large audience of students, faculty and spectators
:iwziilcd the proclamation of inch newly-chosen member.

The tapping of the first twelve—members Myskania since the 1937-38
