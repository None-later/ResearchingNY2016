"F ull Speed Ahead”

A week ago today a challenge was hurled into a
gay, red-hat-sttidded mist of Juniors-~a challenge
to leadership theClass of '45 intends to answer with
reverberations perhaps someday to come throughout
the world.

To work as a tinit, to rise above prejudice, to
make the world a better one is our goal, and our
t’)fCll. We realize the overpowering significance of
this statement, as we realize that the war is our
indestructible and potent concern.

We know, too, that we are an insignificant hand-
ful of people, with perhaps, minds manifested in the
principles of free men our only attribute. But it
is also otir heritage.

Most of the men, and some of the women who
started out. with the Class of ’45 are privileged to
go out and carry into battle this stvord of their
pioneer patriotsma sword which has now assumed
the fortn of torpedoes, bombs, I’-40‘s. We have
confidence in these members of the Class of ’45.

The rest of us must remain here-carrying on,
educating ourselves, drawing the people together,
combatting the war of words, intolerance, and sel-
fishness—-»—firmly rooting democracy here.

Freedom of choice, freedom of student govern-
ment is ours regarding otir own college lives, a free-
dom which in the great future to come may see tiic
light on a world-wide scale.

Power to lead is a Wonderful gift. Wisely used,
it may guide into the way of better things.

Yes, wc‘rc yotiiig, we‘re hopeful. wc‘r‘e ciithus-
iastic, wc‘rc immature. in otir heart and soul, we
know we liavcn‘t let ourselves become discouraged.
if that is immaturity, we want to stay that way.

It‘s going to seem strange filling tiic places of our
once-rivals. Wc‘vc rather gotten uscd to fighting
with them, kidding with them, relying on them . . .
And now they‘re moving otrt. and we‘re moving up,

’l‘hcrc's no use pretending. Wc‘ll fch lost for
a while. .-\nd then we‘ll go right on ahead onward,
forward, upward to our goal carrying on where
lllt'_\' it‘ll (ill.

The ccntury mark for State has [lil\.\t‘tl. .\uothci'
century is beginning where we >llttll all we dcrno—
cracy as the only gm'criit‘ncnt under whir h ttllllll't‘
can freely c\pand. learning proceed. ii'ccdom sur-
\’l\'c. and institutions like Slatc (‘ollcgc c\i~|~' ‘l‘lic
tllltlt c rests with us. if we tittcpl lcadcrsliip and
temper our power with tarct‘iri judgcmcnt, (’tlllﬁltlt'b
ation and valuation, then we arc good lcadcrs,
ilicoi‘cltt‘ally.

'l‘lic practiliility of otir attempts and dctisioiis
remains to be seen. The verification of our leader-
ship ability lies not in what we say, but how much
we accomplish. We have set our goal high enough
so that effort and aggressiveness arc iiidispcnsiblc
in order to mcasurc up. liccausc at the present,
we are just enough of a realist to note that effort
coincides with achievement.

by RHONA RYAN

Last column no inspiration . . . no nothin'.
What to say? What’s the use, anyway? Who cares?

Btit still, there ought to be some last word—prefer-
ably about college. Last words are so difficult, though.
But remember that column you wrote once, about the
type of college student you disliked the most? Joe
Doakes, I think his name was.

Ummmm, let's pull out the old Newses of two years
ago . . . sure enough, here it is. My, you were ambl-
tlous as a Sophomore—free verse, no less. Wonder.
Wonder if it would be a proper thing to do to reprint
it. Sttre, go ahead. You know you can't think of
anything else to write. You know your mind's a
blank. Go ahead, reprint it! Okay. Always sort of
liked that column, anyway. No one else did. But.
heck. this is the last time, your mind isn’t working—
and here's that old column in front of you. Come on.
come on—the people you've always written this col-
tunn for will react it over patiently. The others. you
don't care about anyway. Nuff said—here goes—the
sad and true story of Joe Doakes, college student. . , .

This is the story of Joe Doakes—

Who always did everything- Right.

He did the Right Things as a Freshman;

He wore the Correct Clothes and he

Moved only in the most Approved Circles.

He avoided all the people who did the

Wrong Things, like Reacting Books and

Having ideas, and worst of all,

Doing something about them.

Yott can bet your lit'e Joe didn‘t

Have anything to do with Them.

Nossir, he joined the Right Fra—

Teruity. with the Right Fellows,

And. Boy. was he glad!

Sometimes he used to wonder,

Because he didn‘t seem as happy

As some of the people

Who did the Wrong Things.

But. then. he used to think.

You can‘t have Everything.

Joe was real original.

Joe never Failed a subject. btti

You can bet your life he wasn‘t

Dumb enough to get A‘s. Why,

He knew that only Stooges get A's.

He didn't pay much attention in

Class. either. because everyone know

That was dry stuff for a Regular Guy.

That stuff was for high-brows.

Yeah, Joe was a really good guy.

Right down to earth. and none 01' the

Highfalutin .tuft' some kids affected

About him. He made Myskania, too.

Always doing the Right Thing

That was Joe for you.

And when Joe got a job, he got.

$1800 a year. Of course he

Stayed at that salary for ten years.

Btit Joe used to think to himself.

You've got to work for what you get.

Joe was real original.

He used to hear once in a while

About how some of the guys

Who joined the wrong fraternity

And didn’t pay attention to the

Right Thing to Do

Were getting places fast.

Then he'd get the tiniest sort oi'

Twinge somewhere deep in his soul,

And Wonder if“ he was Dead Right

After all. But. then, he‘d think”

They're just flashes in the pan,

A good solid guy like tire is

(loing to get places, yessir.

After all. they weren‘t anything

in College, Joe was always original

So

He kept right on plugging, and after

Ten years he got a $50 raise.

Yup, .ioc always did the right tlitngw

llc‘d tell you.

And with that last word. which gives you satisfac-
tron, ll no one elsc~ you put tiic cover on the type-
writer. takc a last long look around the PO. and
depart.

The wide. wide world is waiting. Ave atone rule
to lllt‘ .Joc lloakcs. to the ones who liked the colitiiiii.
the ones whc didn't, to the Nt-:\\'.~'. to State,

Juniors Recall

Rare Old Times
In Class Story

Dear Fellows of '45

Junior girls reporting! It‘s been
hard work carrying on without you
to share the work and the fun. We
missed you at the Junior Banquet
and at the Junior Weekend which
might have been. But most of all
we missed you this Moving-Up Day
when we carried our banner down
the steps of Draper to the spot
where every Junior class has stood
looking forward to their Senior
year. We've seen some of you
around and walking down the halls
in your brand new uniforms, the
same halls in which you helped us
lose rivalry in our freshman year.

We've had Guff and Crumm and

all same as before and in addition
we've had Buyck who has added
zest and a merry chuckle or two
at our meetings
official and other—
wise. They've done
a good job, these
kids; they and a
lot of other people
who never get
their pictures in
the headlines.
That‘s part of the
spirit of ottr class.
this cooperation
and sharing of
little things.

\‘Vc've been busy this year. we've
pitched in and helped with all the
Big 'l‘ens; that's t'or you fellows.
In between classes and sometimes
in classes we've written letters tcll-
ing you about Methods at 8:10, Ed
10 on Friday, our green sister class
and all the little pics we've had our

fingers in. Our
biggest pic is the
"Junior M i s s "
coming up this
week-end. when
five of our most
bcutit‘ul girls will
vie for the title of
May Queen. We‘re
looking forward to
a great year next
year btit mean-
while we'd like to
reminisce.

We coukln't help thinking back
to ottr freshman year this Moving-
Up Day. We kept thinking back to
the time when we froze at Fresh
camp and one of the fellows offered
the Dean a candy bar . . . our first
orientation meeting . the open
houses at fraternities and sororities

. our first All—State dance with
the music ot‘ Bob Reid and Bill
Grattan . . . the
time the Red 
Raiders nabbed

and '44 bt‘uisci's

Frosh Become Port Of‘Siaie—
Standard Moving-Up Day Legend

by Vivien N ielson

“It's a great big puddle and I‘m
just a little frog.”

Lunches at the Boul, pledge duty,
iindying with Lashinsky, broaden-
ing our A's, cutting that last class,
and viewing the austere Myskania
was our freshman fate. State seem-
ed just a succession of baffling and
wonderful interludes. Each moment
was filled with suspense, admira-
tion, fellowship and fear—fear that
we would never be truly a part of
this wonderful new world—State.

We attended assemblies and were
duly initiated to Myskania, Slack's
announcements, Casey’s smile, and
the Alma Mater. We slaved over
posters, counted headlines, ushered
and hopefully went to AD tryouts.
'i‘hespis smiled when we undertook
our first musical—the freshman
Big Ten. “Heaven Waited" as we
resurrected minstrel jokes. made
Zorina’s out of the boys. and drifted
to heavenly music at our star-
sttidded dance. State having been
taken by storm by our collossal
achievement, we proudly displayed
oitr life-raft aloft the stamp booth
for \'\’.A.C.

Along nbottt now, the rumors we
had been hearing about a mysterious
tradition known as Moving—Up Day
became stronger. What was this
ceremony that brought smiles and
tears to those participating?

'l‘hc smiles and tears became
reality when we sang thrc, Oli
li'hcrc and slowly began our trek
from the balcony. Every pulsating
heart nearly stopped as Myskania
began its slow walk around the
stage. .loy filled our hearts as we

saw three years of endeavor recog-
nized by a slim purple and yellow
ribbon that meant so much.

We filed proudly out of Page
Hall, to be greeted by two rows of
smiling Juniors and Seniors—they
were smiling at us, and we smiled
right back, proud of them and of
State. Come the dawn, a Sophomore
line and their theme song was, one,
two, three, snatch, as we ran
through the Soph mill.

Sweet revenge ensued when Sul-
livan and his “Rough Riders"
emerged from our line with ruffled
hair-do and disheveled blue and
white. The afternoon brought fam-
iliar faces and places in “To-
morrow's Teachers.”

With a last minute tra-la and a
dash of the eye brow pencil, we
rushed off to the skits that evening.
Having enlightened our audience to
the plights of the class of 1844, we
assumed our places on the campus
for the Sing.

Melodies floated out of the hushed
campus as each class rendered its
musical tributes to State. And then,
it was only the Senior voices which
rose as the Class of ‘44 began its
stately walk away from their Alma
Mater.

Moving-Up Day was officially
over. Looking back at Page Hall
brought the sudden realization that
we, just a group of fresh, were a
part of State. We belonged. Every
song, every tradition, every hope
and heartache was ottrs. We were
no longer the "fresh" of State, but
a living vital part of her. We had
accepted State and State had ac-
cepted us, for better or for worse.

All in all, 1944-45 should be a
