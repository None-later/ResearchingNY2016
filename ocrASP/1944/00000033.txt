Surprise.
all Kiley enthusiasts who have turn-
ed eagerly to the hallowed page 4
spot to learn what words of wisdom
the master has uttered. Your dis-
appointment must have been great
at finding no smiling, friendly face
beaming at you from among the
cats. Yes, we‘are sorry for the two
of you but the Junior issue is upon
us and ’45 takes over.

We would feel out of place as a
columnist if we did not try our
hand at reminiscing. especially in a
junior issue. It’s a time-horrid tra-
dition and who are we not to follow
in the assorted footsteps of Byrne,
Kiley, Ryan, Marsh—and even Mc-
Grath and Johnston.

In the field of Junior athletics
we'll never forget . . . Garfall streak—
ing across the finish line, yards
ahead of her fellow sack-racers . . .
Nora Giavelli’s name appearing on
the list of entries for the men’s ten-
nis tournament. The sport’s depart-
ment had enough copy for weeks . . .
Rivalry. Our freshman year, a
moral victory; in '43, a real one . : .
the fresh defeat of '44’s women in
softball—~the highlight of our Rivalry
career . . . that now famous trip to
Camp Johnston made last winter.
The spirit was willing—but a taxi
from the station was only 50 cents
. . . and then there was that ad we
answered. WANTED—one sport’s
writer—female. There should be a
law. Maybe the brand new student
council could investigate the possi-
bilities.

The Great Loss

But no recital of memories would
be complete without a few of the
men of '45. At the risk of being even
more trite than We have been al-
ready. we shed a tear for the days
when there were such things.

There's the story of how Zaccag-
nini kept the fellows at Fresh camp
awake till three one morning telling
corny jokes.

We’d like to pay tribute to Stan
Gipp, who would be writing this
column now, if it weren't for greet-
ings from the president. All we can
say. Stan. is, “Haing an awful time,
wish you were here."

Dave Griffin was the fast lad who
lost money for practically everyone
at State, except the oat-binner. _

People are still chuckling over “Big
John” Sussina’s generosity. It seems
that John was beating his opponent
very badly in a golf match. Being
a noble soul. and noticing what said
opponent was doing wrong. Sussma
corected him. John lost the match.
Remember how down everyone was
when a report came that the lad had
been lost in action in Africa? Two
months later Johnny was back at
school, very much alive. His only
comment was. “I guess that report
must have been wrong."

Mullin. ’45’s fair-haired boy, took
a lot of good-natured kidding in his
day but he was more than a good
athlete; he was a good sport.

Who can forget Goldie's efforts?
Softball was his forte and his rou-
tine was in 5 back 4. to the side 3
and a graceful flop. But he usually
caught the ball.

Typical of Hippick was his squar-
ing off with the 6' 3" iceman in the
Frosh-YMCA game. We had our
money on Buck.

Last but definitely not least We
had Tassoni. Joe. more than once
saved the day. He never gave up.
We remember the day he anchor-
maned on the frosh tug of war team.
He just dug in his heels and stuck.

We wish there were more room to
expound on the prowess of “15’s mzin-
hood. State misses them all.

A story printed elsewhere on this
page concerning a certain defeat of
n ccitaln class lll softball is either a

malicious rumor or an attempt to
sabotage the Junior issue.

'45 Demonstrate WAA Softball League
Begins Season On Schedule

Pep And Drive

Since ll’s Arrival

—— by Marie DeChene

 

The class which arrived at State
in the fall of ’41, has consistently
shown the “pep and drive" lauded
in one of its pep songs. “The Crim-
son Tide" has been, and is, an out-
standing class in all ways, athletics
included. In fact, we began our
athletic career at Frosh camp on
Burden Lake. with swimming. row-
ing. hiking, and tennis enjoyed by
157 girls. Dirty-faced, footsore. and
weary. we returned to State, only
to find that WAA had arranged a
picnic at Indian Ladder for us. We
remembered the bruised shins,
aching muscles. et al. of camp, yet
’45 carried on and entered whole-
heartedly into the rigors of soft-
ball, more hiking, and the uncork-
ing of countless coke bottles.

Now. being fully orientated. we
promptly began athletics in earnest.
Nora Giavelli. the first '45'er to
hit the sports headlines. created a
sensation when she competed in the
men's tennis tourney and put up
an amazingly good fight. The so-
called superior sex came to the fore
however. and Fran Mullin finished
as the victor. Flo Garfall began her
athletic career by winning the
women's tennis tourney cup, which.
by the way, she still has. since the.
past two tourneys were never com—
pleted.

Rivalry Was Sad

We admit that when it came to
rivalry against ’44 we Weren‘t so good.
although we did win softball and the
obstacle races.

It was in our sophomore year that
the “Crimson Tide" really went to
town and overflowed the “Blue
Devils." Sussina's six-man squad
smothered Chellemi's aggregation
in the rivalry touch football game.
Fran Mullin led his men to a 49-29
victory over the class of '46, in the
rivalry basketball game, and the
women came out on top by winning
two out of three cage games 36-32.
35-25, to add six more points to our
rivalry score.

And who can ever forget that
hockey game when the intrepid Flo
as goalie used her experience on the
tennis courts and stopped the fly-
ing puck in veritable Alice Marble
style? This unorthodox procedure
saved the day however, for '45 won
the game 3-1, and gained three more
rivalry points.

Rivalry Was Glad

Yep. the class sporting the colors
of red and white shone in rivalry
last year. And we took good care
of that cup. too-ask any Junior!

This past year, probably due to
increasing age. weary bones and
various and sundry other com-
plaints. ‘450rs have not been outs
standineg active in sports. Now, of
course. it‘s imposibic to brag of
Tassoni‘s touchdowns. Mullhi’s
court (basketball and tennis) tac-
tics. and Glpp's home runs. So. we
shall have to content ourselves
with women's sports alone. These.
by the way. took a masculine turn
last fall. when the girl’s football
game featured the athletic season.

We predict a great and glorious
senior year for the "Crimson Tide."
Willi practice teaching us a iict'cs-
siii'y sideline. we'll carry on in
sports!

Loy Thai Baseball Down,
Babe, Put Thai Bal Away:

The unforgotten men of State
have challenged the slugging
women of the softball leagues to
a little game. If all goes well,
and the male constitutions hold
out. the game is expected to take
place this Sunday morning on
the dorm field.

Catchers' masks. shin guards,
chest protectors, gloves for both
hands, and bomb-proof helmets
will be part of the attire that
each participant will include in
his defensive equipment.

The results of this tilt are
looked forward to with no little
interest. Spectators are urged
not to throw coke bottles, pro-
grams aiid other articles which
may tend to annoy the players.

WAA Ollers
Spring Variety

Now that the spring sports sea-
son is in full swing. the lists on the
WAA bulletin board display the
names of a considerable number of
proponents of the various sports.
During each entire week, the dorm
field will be the scene of a great
deal of WAA activity.

Badminton. under the direction
of Flip Malloy and Irene McCor-
mick. may be played on the dorm
field on Tuesday and Thursday
from 3:30-5:30 p. m. and also on
Saturday from 10-12 a. m. Volley-
ball also takes place on Tuesday
and Thursday at 3:30 p. m. at the
dorm field. Students who are in-
terested in archery should see eith-
er Saily Whitcombe or Marge Wor-
sley. captains.

Hiking seems to have drawn a
large number of WAA enthusiasts
and several girls have already ob-
tained WAA credit. A group of girls
have scheduled a hike to the Helder-
burg mountains. The group will leave
from Pierce Hall on Saturday at. 10
a. m. All those interested in going
should see Jean Davidson, captain.

Riding again takes its place as
an important feature on the spring
program. Anyone interested in this
sport may call the Ranch for res-
ervations or see Peg Schlott. cap-
tain.

Seniors Top Freshmen

Sophs Surpass Juniors

The girls’ baseball league has get-
ten off to an unusually good start
this year. The first two games were
played without mishap on the day
they were scheduled.

Last Monday. the freshmen play-
ed the Seniors. to get the season off
to a rousing start. Hennessey pitch-
ed a good strong game for the class
of ‘44. Fielding on both sides was
rather sloppy with the Fresh team-
play just a little worse than that
of their opponents.

Powerhouse Stuff

Hitting throughout the game was
strictly of the slugging kind. The
Senior girls managed to group their
hits more successfully and garnered
a neat 22-8 victory. Mary Domann.
playing for the class of ‘44, was not
the star player for her team.

On Wednesday. the Sophomores
defeated their rivals of last year,
the Juniors. in a well-played and
very enthusiastic game.

Giavelli and Garfall pitched for
the Juniors. Fillman made the
play of the afternoon on a hard-hit
line drive. There was some doubt
as to whether the spectators or the
star was more amazed to find that
the ball had actually been caught.
Seymour Stars

The Sophomores. behind the sur-
prisingly finished pitching of Mary
Seymour. plowed through at a
steady pace. In the first inning. '45
was put down 1-2-3. in the best Big
League style. Garfali made the
only home run of the game. Our
amphibious. undaunted girls refus-
ed to let rain or storms stop them
and waded through the last two in-
nings to bring the game to a close.
The final score stood at 25-20 in
favor of the class of ‘46.

It was apparent. that all the
teams were badly in need of prac-
tice. There was. however, noticeable
improvement over the brand of play
exhibited in the rivalry game of last
week.

Today, the Sophomores are set to
oppose the Senors. The last game
in the league will be between the
F'rosh and the Sophs. It is expected
to be one of the highlights of the
season, since a spirit of friendly ri-
valry has characterized all events
between these two classes through—
out the year.

WAA Credit

Georgette Dunn. ‘46. and Lois
Drury. '45. are co-captains of base-
ball for this year. Those interested
in obtaining credit for baseball may
do so by turning out for the three
games in which their respective
teams will play in the league. Even
acting as a substitute makes you
eligible for credit.

Dickinson Elected
As MAA Head

That happy smile that has been
seen floating around the place all
week belongs to none other than
our own Robert Dickinson, ’47. new-
ly elected head of MAA. Bob, as
his friends call him, is the first in-
coming sophomore to hold this of-
fice. He won over Art Kaufman,
also '47, who will be his assistant
for the coming year. When learning
of his election, Bob said in his slow
drawi. "Gosh!"

Well Qualified, Huh?

In moving into such an important
post, Bob has many talents that
qualify him. so he says. In high
school he played third base on the
baseball team and also forward on
the basketball squad. Here at State
he gained his first fame by having
his picture smeared all over the
sports page. With all the momen-
tum that lie must have gained with
that jump pass. it is little wonder
that he landed his present job.
From football he got back into his
first love. basketball, playing sev-
eral games with the Collegians.
That crowning night he was high
scorer in the classic game against
the girls. He also got a team of
State men to oppose John Couiter's
A.C., but his efforts in that game
weren‘t too spectacular. In six trips
to the plate he hit only one ball out
of the infield.

Great Plans

Bob has already formulated a
vigorous athletic program for next
year. He plans to have the usual
football league in the fall and bas—
ketball in the winter. Basketball
will start in the fall if there aren't
enough men for football. Another
item on the docket is the continua-
tion of gym once a week for those
who are interested.

State Play JCAC

In Return Encounter

The last time the JCAC came to
Albany they lost a softball game to
state. Ready for anything they have
challenged the boys to another
game and will be on hand again
this coming Sunday afternoon. The
last game was a thrilling affair
that was close all the way. The
final result was State 4, JCAC 3.
Arnold (Hot LiDS) Brown. new man-
ager of the Teachers. promises that
the results of the impending en-
counter will be even more satisfy-
ing to the sport fans of the college.

Brown expresses hope that the
dorm field will be opened for use
so that the boys will not have to
face the vagaries of weather for a
second time. He would again like
to enter a plea for a competent um-
pire.

On Memorial Day

D. V. Smith To Deliver
Day's Principal Speech

Memorial Day will see the climax
of the entire Big' Ten Program—
the Presentation Service. The ser-
vice will be held at 2 PM. in the

age Hall auditorium.

Mary Curran. '45. Head of the
Big Ten Committee. will present the
bond. bought with the Big Ten pro-
ceeds. to Col. Stuart R. Cni‘swcll.
Second Service Command. Albany.
New York. Col Cni'chll. in turn.
will present the bond to Dr. John
M. Sziylcs. President of the College.
to be used us it scholarship for a
veteran oi' the child of u vetci'nii of
World War 11.

Dr. Domini V. Smith. President of
Cortland College and former Profes—
sor of Social Studies at Shite. will
be the principal speaker. The title
of' his speech will be “From Failing
Hands." The program will close
with the singing of The Star Spun-
glcd Banner.

Big Ten Goal

The original purpOsc of the Big
Ten was to purchase ii field umbul-
nncc. Since it was impossible to
pay for the c" lllllCt‘ directly. due
to Army rcgultitpns. it was decided
that a bond be purchased to cover
the cost of the ambulance. Student.
Association later decided that the
money that will be received from the
bond in ten years he used as a
scholarship fund.

Last fall, the Big Ten Commitce
set the Lion] at $1200 When. ut the
half-way mark. the proceeds had far
surpassed the goal, a new goal of
$1780 was decided upon. Since the
$120 goal for each presentation has
been topped by all of them so far.
the Committee expects to exceed the
$1780 net goal. The entire sum
turned in to the Big Ten Committee
will be invested in the l‘ ud.

The field ainbulunci which the
bond will pay for will be on display
in front of Page Hall on May 30,
ill 2 P.M.. for students to view.

Miss Curran urges that the stu-
deiil body attend the service. "since
it was the students who raised the
money through supporting the Big
Ten. and it is the students who are
spending it." The faculty is also
invited to attend.

ln Assembly Discussion

A composite program including
the presentation of a movie on cur-
rent :iffnirs and t1 discussion on the
possibility of a Student Union will
be in order today in assembly.

Dr. Michael Dorizuf of the Whar-
ton Scliool of Finance and Commerce
n the University of Pennsylvania
appeared in the Page I’lull auditor-
ium lost year with his l'('t'l on World
Wnr ll. Dr. Doi'lxnl' received so
great illl ovation from the student
l)( dy which evinced much inlcrest in
his movie that SCA invited him to
return to Stiitc with his lull-st up-to—
dutc films. The movie will include
scenes from the various battlefields
in Europe and At'i‘icu. botli still mid
action shots.

Student l‘nion Discussion
li‘ollowing the showing of the
movie. there will be it short discus-
sion on the cstubiishincnl of Student
Union or the expenditure of the sur-
plus iii soiiic ollier manner. A Slu-
dcnt Union would call for an enlarge-
ment of Fiii'rcll House for the pur-
pose of' providing ti place of recrea-
tion for the student body. Student
(luiicis. receptions and offices would
beheld in this hall. The approximate
cost of such :1 project would be $200.-
000 of which the $1,800 ill the surplus
would be the first investment. Each
senior upon graduation would be
asked to pledge $100 to be given to
[he college during his first ten years
us fill :iluninac. The balance of the
would be paid back in subsequent
necessary revenue could be obtained
by :i loun mode 0:. the present pro-
perty ol' Farrell flail. This icon
will be rcpuid in future years by
the student body of state who
use the Student Union. Each
student would have to pay a $10 tux
ill the beginning of each semester
for the maintenance of the Union.
Such inaintcniinCe would provide
for a salary for ilie Hostess. for
cleaning. etc.

Since most colleges have a Student
Union incorporated in the associa—
tion. the probable necessity of one
at. State will rest temporarily with
the current student group. 11' the

it may be utilized for the reduction

Frosh Week-End

Frosh cnnip once again will give
way to Frosh weekend t'or 1944—‘45
due to war-time transportation con-
ditions and facilities. Last year’s
three days of informal orientation
for the Class 01' '47 proved success-
ful. and will be repeach this Sep-
tember in Pierce and Saylcs Hails
illl(l the surrounding field.

The weekend's program has not
us yet been officially released. but
will doubtlesst include softball
games. tennis. pillow-fights. and in-
troductions to upperclassmen and
faculty members. The list for coun-
sellors for Fi‘osh weekend is nested
in Dean Stokes' office. Interested
upperclassmen may sign up dur-
ing the next few days.

Last week over 110 people signed
up for the position of Junior and
Sophomore guides. Student guides
were begun to provide a specified
group of upperclassnien whose duty
it would be to acquaint the incom-
ing freshmen with the college and
extra—eurricular activities. During
the first few (lays ot' the new sem-
ester, several of these guides con-
duct tours through all the college
buildings explaining the set-up. A
meeting will be held the early part
of next week to choose the leader
for the Student Guide group and
to make the necessary plans for
next year.

Since the Class of '48 will prob-
ably equal the size of the present
freshman class. it is expected that
:1 larger Student. Gulde group and
couiisclloi's' outfit will be needed
than last year.
