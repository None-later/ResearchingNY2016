By Joan Bylind

We would like to deplore some-
thing, and. surprisingly enough, it
Isn't WAA. It is. rather, the lack of
student interest in WAA activities.

Whether the general public real-
izes it or not. we here at State Col-
legc have an unusually varied and
complete athletic program manag-
ed hy an alert and capable group of
officers. Our equipment is adequate.
facilities are near at hand and. yet,
sports do not assume the place they
should and could have in State Col—
lege life.

No Spectators

Last fall only four spectators saw
the final match of the mixed tennis
tournament. Two of these sport
fans just happened to be going
through the park on their way hotne
from school.

This winter state had two fenc-
ing matches with LaSalle. The cap-
tain was able to count the audience
each time without taking her shoes
off.

Even the recent playoffs of the
basketball league which attracted
more comment than any other af-
fair athletic has in quite some time.
could have been better attended.

And who. or what is responsible
for this situation? We believe that
the blame cannot be placed on any
particular person or organization.
Probably more interest would have
been evidenced IF students had
known the when and where of these
events.

WAA must take part 01' the blame
and the sport's department, too.
comes in for its share. We realize
that there have been pOsters an-
nouncing events but obviously these
have not been too effective. For
example. last fall. there was a very
good-looking poster giving the set-
up of the tennis tournament but
the times when these matches were
to be played was nowhere to be
found. If the captains had noted
these on the sign. or. even better.
if separate posters had been made,
the tennis tournament could have
been made more popular. .
'lroutie. ’l‘ioulilc

Next year. to be frank with all
concerned. the sport‘s department
is going to have a difficult time
ﬁlling up page four. We are in the
position to give WAA and MAA all
the publicity they want. If we can
have their close cooperation in pro-
viding the where. when and why
of everything going on. we promise
complete and full coverage. We
will even have our reporters there
to watch the events they are to
lwrite about and that should help a
0t.

Another suggestion we would like
to make is that our athletic associa-
tions offer more competition in
sports. We have all watched arch-
ery. hiking. and golf die a natural
death and we cannot help but feel
that if competition could be worked
in somehow these sports would be
more attractive. A proof of this
is in the current softball league,
By placing the sport on an lnterclass
contest basis more enthusiasm has
been aroused for it than ever before.
Such Sweet Sorrow

With this parting observation. we
fold our typewriter like the Arabs
and silently steal away. We've en-
joyed our stay on page four this
year and hope that next year you'll
enjoy yours.

 

 

 

Men Massacre
Girls By 30-8

In Slow Game

Continuing on their unbeaten way
the men handed the girls a 30-8
shellacking in softball. The game
was played Sunday afternoon on
the Dortn field. The game wasn't
close from the first time that the
men came to bat. Garfall hurled
for the girls and while she did her
best, the superior hitting power of
the men made itself felt. Long flies
were constantly eluding the female
cutfielders with the result that 15
errors were chalked up against
them. Several of these miscues
Were made by the inflelders. but
were not as costly as those made by
the outer gardeners. Six errors
were committed by the men. but
with the lead that they constantly
maintained there was no danger in-
volved.

The girls managed only five hits
although many drives that would
have been good in competition with
members of their own sex wore turn-
cd into easy put—outs by tiie men.
This was especially true of high
flies of which only one was muffed
by the male outfield.

The girls went down in order in
the top half of the first inning. One
strike-out featured this stair/.a, Mel—
ville being the victim of Kiley‘s soft
tosses. The men scored four times
in their half on four hits. a walk
and two fleldcr‘s choices.

I’ike Hits

The girls got their first. hit in the
second. but left two men stranded
on the base paths when Dunn filed
to Miller in short field. The men
scored four more times in the home
half of the second. Pike. second
man tip. hit the only home run of
the game when his smash to left.
field eluded Dunn.

The girls went down in order for
the second time in the game when
Sanderson struck-out and Garfall
and Pickett grounded out. The men
pushed five rims across the dish on
six hits, including doubles by
Brown and Dorn. and three errors.
Kiley ended tht tuning by popping
out to Garfall.

The fourth inning found the girls
pushing over their first tallies. All
of them were scored without the
benefit of a hit as Kiley gave up
three walks and four errors were
made behind him. As if angered by
the four rtins they gave to the girls.
the fellows racked up six runs on
three hits. three errors and one
fieldcr‘s choice.

Girls Get Break

By this time the game was get-
ting into a rut. so Bob Sullivan
went in as umpire. He proved to
be a little psychic for he was calling
balls and strikes almost before the
ball left the pitcher's hand. He
leaned a bit towards the girls and
in the remainder of the game Kiley
gave up five more walks.

The girls scored once more in the
seventh and three times in the top
half of the ninth. The men dented
the plate once in the sixth. three
times in the seventh and five runs
crossed the rubber in the eighth.
This ended the scoring as the men
did not come to bat in their half
of the ninth.

"Terrible Thirteen” Strikes,-
Bui Newman Stands Ready

The women of State have really
become desperate for something
to divert their over-worked and
exam-conscious minds. Big Ten
Affairs are over, Francello’s hair
does not need a shearing, study-
ing is out for the duration and
so the "Terrible Thirteen" were
at a loss for something exciting
to do when they happened upon
a group of hardy Newmanites and
challenged them to a softball
game. The fierce Newmanites.
proud of their athletic prowess.
displayed no qualms at the
thought of facing the "Terrible
Thirteen” on the diamond and
immediately accepted the chal—
lenge. The final outcome of the
game is unpredictable at this
point. nevertheless. we :an safely
predict a “hard-fought and holly-
conlcsted" sessioii--»-ihc list of
players should prove this.

The gory tilt is scheduled to
lake place this Sunday on the
Dorm Field.

 

 

 

WAA Inaugurates
New Credit Program

Due to a recent misunderstand-
lug concerning credit. which is given
for all women's sports. WAA wishes
to make an announcement. in order
to clarify the situation.

In previous years. WAA has re-
quired that all women who desire to
obtain credit in any sport must par-
ticipate in that sport for a total 01'
ten hours. However. that system
has been altered somewhat this
year since some of the sports have
not been offered for ten hours. In
place of the former system. WAA
Inns i;iai.,,ii';.t,c.. a new plan. This
plan will work in such a way that
WAA credit for all sports will be
determian on a percentage basis.
Credit will be given to all those
participating in a sport for a cer-
tain percentage of the hours that
the sport is offered.

MAA Buys Bat, Balls

Bert Kiley announced today that
MAA has purchased four new soft-
balls and a new softball bat. With
this new equipment Kiley would
like to arrange for a few games in
the next couple of weeks.

If WAA wants a return engage-
ment or if any of the sororities
wish to play a game. just leave a
notice in the MAA mail box and a
game will be arranged.

Seniors Trounce Sophs
Froin Bow To Juniors'

The girls' softball league is still
moving forward at a steady pace.
The weather man has been unusual-
1y kind and only allowed it to rain
at the end of the games. which is
a welcome relief from the general
trend of Albany elements on State
College sports.

The class of '44 has once again
strengthened the suspicion that it
is possible to combine beauty and
brawn to get unexpected results.
They are undefeated in the two
games they have played in the lea-
gtie.

Seniors Shine

Last Friday. fresh on the heels of
their victory over the Fresh. the
Seniors thrashed their way through
to win over their sister class. Filial
love was lorgottcn as Daly slashed
vigorously at Seymour‘s best efforts
and l-leuesscy gave her all for the
cause of dear old '44.

Despite the fact that she chalked
up three strike-outs. Hencssey‘s
pitching left much to be asked. Site
gave an average of two walks p-cr
iniilng. all of which were utilized.
Scyniour's pitching was also spotty.

The umpires finally clamped down
on the illegal pitching stances. and
official rules will be strongly en-
forced from now on.

The final score was 15-12. in fav-
or of the class of '44.

Monday. the Juniors swarmed
over the freshmen to the tune of
27-9. Braithwaitc and Tcliiin were
powerless to stop the hard-hitting
Crimson Tide. Together they yield-
ed 37 hits. Russo (lid not live tip
to expectations. Campbell played a
strong game.

Gal-fall Stars

Flo Garfall was in her usual good
form. Hcr pitching was steady and
although she gave up quite a few
hits they were safely scattered
throughout the innings. She man-
aged to collect six of her team's hits.
including a IlOllll' run and a triple.
Most of her teammates collected
foilr hits apiece.

The freshmen lost. their chalice to
catch up when they went down 1-2-
3. in two successive timings.

The games are umplred by mem-
bers of WAA. The number of spec-
tutors who decorate the sidelines
are always well-equipped with strong
lungs and an inexhaustible store of
insults and impromptu cheers.
Vengeance

The Seniors are slated to oppose
the Juniors this Monday. In their
freshman year the class of '45 de-
feated ‘44 in rivalry softball and
the Seniors are looking forward
eagerly to sweet. revenge.

WAA Festival
To Be Held Soon

WAA’s annual Awards Festival
will be held next Wednesday in the
rear of Farrell House. The mem-
bers of old and new council will
meet for a supper at 5:30 in the
summer house.

All members of WAA are invited

begin at seven o'clock. These will
include the installation of the new

urer. Mary Seymour, '42. and Office
Manager. Georgette Dunn. ’46.

After the installation. keys and
class numerals will be presented to
those people who have earn-ed the
necessary credit. hours in sports.

The bowling trophy will be given
to Phi Delta. champs of the bowl-
ing tournament. Chi Sigma Theta
will receive the highly coveted bits-
kctball trophy as a result. of win-
ning the recently completed cage
tourney.

Gettc Dunn. '46. and Frances Mc—
Cormick. '47, are in charge of ar-
tangemrnts for the festival and
urge till WAA‘z'r» to attend.

WAA-MAA
LooI< to Future

Mary Now. '45. newly-elected
President of WAA. in an interview
yesterday. released a few of her
plans for next, year‘s activities of
the organization.

Miss Now wants to have more iii—
formal piaydays during the year.
These will be "Just spontaneous af-
fairs wherc a bunch of girls can
come out and have fun playing
various games."

She would like to have more
people bring back bikes from home
so there can be more bike hlkcs
than are now offered.

In addition to the sports presently
offered. WAA plans to have a fail
hayride.

With these plans. and more to be
formulated yet by the new council,
Miss Now is looking forward to a
bigger u..d better year than ever.

Bob Dickinson. new MAA director,
has released a definite sports pro-
gram for next year. In keeping
with former years he announced
that. there would be an lnlra-n'uu'al
football league next fall. However.
if there aren‘t. enough men in the
incoming freshman class, basketball
will be started in the fail and con-
tiiutc through to spring.

In regards to the basketball. Dick-
inson is going to try to have a semi-
varslty. playing such teams as the
Slena. Union and RPI junior var-
sitles. If he can arrange for these
games. new uniforms will be pur-
chased for the team. He believes
that with the fellows coming back
and the new additions. State will
havo good basketball during the
coming year.
