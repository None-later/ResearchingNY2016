of approximately $1800.. enough
to purchase a war bond that was
used to buy a field ambulance. The

This year the “Big Eight" will
make it appearance as the backbone

tee for the "Big Eight." Other mem-
bers on the committee are Mary Lou

Class of '48 was introduced to Miss

idea of what one wears around State

the l'uct that the Class of “‘18 is sur—

what. but it was necessary to place
about 46 freshmen in private homes.

Dean Stokes corrected the rumor
