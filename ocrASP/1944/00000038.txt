Spurt's department it has been a
‘ standard policy for the new editor
to spend his or herfirst column
 analizing the talents athletic of the
incoming frosh and predicting the
future of WAA and MAA according-
ly. And as each of the aforemen-
tioned editors has done, we are
about to issue a glowing report.
Yes, Football v»
From accounts we’ve heard, the
future looks good—to be conserva-
tive. When there is hope for an
all-man Rivalry football game we'd
venture to say that things are look-
ing up. The last time such an event
took place was in ’42. Most of the
boys who gave their all that day
are now giving their all on another,
different, field Of action. But be-
fore we digress too far, we want to
wish MAA lots of luck‘ with their
football plans; and the various local
draft boards. Our motive is slightly
ulterior, we must confess. . . Th
more MAA does. the better We like

CD

it.
About WAA

From where we sit, this looks like
WAA's year. They have excellent
leadership, a full schedule. and.
certainly, plenty of material with
which to work. We hear that two
of the frosh have played softball
with a professional league team.
Much interest was shown in the
sport last year. Now with this ad-
ded incentive We are expecting great
things.

It even begins to looks as if Gar—
fall will have to do some stepping
this year to k eep the tennis trophy.
There finally is some competition
lined up. For the benefit of the
“uninitiated” and those with short
memories, Flo won the tournament
when she was a fresh. Since then
the weather and the Albany Par-I:
Dep’t have conspired to end the
season before the tournament could
be. We're keeping our typewriters
crossed for this year.

Suggestion of the Week

And. by the way. sport fans. these
tennis matches make really worth-
while watching. We'd like to put in
a plug for better attendance. You
can see a good game. enjoy the
senic beauty of Washington Park.
and get your daily quota of Vitamin
D via direct contact. all in one
afternoon. Here's hoping that the
captains will publish the times of
matches. It will give us a chalice
to check up on the effectiveness of
our advertising.

Now for the usual word to the
frosh. Ever since you arrived you've
been handed all brands of advice.
It's an upperclassman's privilege.
You’re probably immune by now but
here are some bits of wisdom we
hope you will at least consider. A
teacher to be successful must de-
velop a well-rounded personality.
Your studies are important—don‘t
neglect them—but anyone who do-
votes all her time to study is misr-
ing out on an important part of
college life. She loses out as far
as forming friendships and keeping
in touch with the outside world is
concerned. The rude awakening
comes when the young teacher finds
herself totally out of sympathy with
the interests of her students. She
finds no common ground on which
to meet them.

This build-up is leading to an
appeal to the frosh to be active in
sports. We find no better method
for keeping fit, working off excess
energy and forming valuable f‘ricnd-
ships. In high school. it seems that
only the athletic super-women are
considered and encouraged. The
honor of Podunk High is continually
at stake. Here at State. however.
everyone who likes a sport is urged
to come out and have some fun.
There are opportunitics for the
“average” player.

Help

As we look about the News office.
we are chccrod by the cleanliness.
the cosy atmosphere, the quantities
of space. The only thing that wor-
ries us a little is the absence of
people. The Sports Corner seems
particularly empty. Frankly, we
miss the happy throng and would
greatly appreciate the presence of
any new and interesting faces. In
short. if anyone would care to try
out for the sport’s department. We
would love to have them.~—-The only
requirement being a knowledge of
the English language. A slight in-
terest in sports would naturally be
appropriate.

STATE COLLEGE NEWS, FRIDAY, SEPTEMBER 15, 1944

 

Rumors oF Football Circulale
As Slate Rediscover: Men

“We have men again!”

“Football? Real football? Not
Just the Serabian kind?”

“Ah, yes. 1944 has brought
thirty-three more members of
that rare species "men" to State,
the “co-ed" home of females, and
with them come rumors of foot-
ball and intercollegiate basket-
ball games to thrill the hearts of
all good statesmen.

Rumor also says that Kaufman
and Dickinson are getting to-
gether, with Hess, men’s sports
reporter listening in. . . And that
basketball games among the
stronger sex may yet become a
part of rivalry this year.

But the wise will wait and
hope, before singing a prayer of
thanks. . . .

 

 

 

Frosh Campers
Rugged BulRighi

— McGRATH and JOHNSTON —

Amidst flying balls, the crack of
bats, creaking bones, and general
confusion. the class of '48 was off
to a flying start. Not only are they
super-athletic, agile and spirited,
but our newest additions took all
that frosh week-end had to offer—
and came back for more.

In true sport’s page style, the
events were both hard-fought and
hotly contested! See, you can tell
Kiley’s gone.) Out of the kindness
of our hearts we feel it our duty
to warn the Green Gremlins that
they are in for some pretty stiff
competition.

Rumors, rumors

Action on the baseball diamond
was fast and furious. The hitting
was surprisingly good although the
fielding will probably improve in
time. There were even two pro-
fessionals to lead the way. Rita
Shapiro should spark-plug the frosh
attack throughout the season. Ru-
mor has it that she is a hardened
veteran of a big city league: This
same rumor bug neglected to divulge
the name of our other pro. How-
ever. it is not too early to predict
that with customary freshman acu-
men. they arc probably saving her
as a secret weapon.

Mary Bess Vernoy ’46 and Peg
Bostwick ‘45 had charge of tennis.
Prospects look exceptionally good
this year according to their glowing
reports.
ﬂight this way, ladies

One of the highlights of last
week—end was a grand tour of Al-
bany. the college, and environs—r—on
foot! We thought this was particu-
larly considerate of the counsellors.
since a jaunt or two up State Street
should be sufficient to put any
freshman into the invigorated and
(levil-may-cnre condition that is a
prerequisite to withstanding rigors
of the Johnston-Foster regime in
lower Page.

It was agreed that fresh week-end
was indeed a gay and not too pain-
lul initiation into the routine of
State. It is an cxpcricncc that will
not soon be forgotten by the fortu-
nate participants.

Frosh Frolic Postponed

Due to inclement weather, WAA’s
Frosh Frolic, which was scheduled
to be hold on last Wednesday. was
postponed. If the weather permits.
the affair will take place on the
Dorm Ficid, tomorrow. between
2:30 and 5:00 p. m. llcicn Slack and
Eileen Shoup arc in charge of the
activities and they promise a full
program including plenty of refresh~
moms! All students are invited to
attend.

Infra-Mural Football Loop
Charted For This Year

Men’s Rivalry Game
Discussed As Feature

In his first press conference of
the year MAA director Bob Dickin-
son announced that there would be
intra-mural football at the college
this fall. He plans to have a four
team loop and more if humanly
possible. He stressed the fact that
the league will be open to members
of all classes and urged the fresh-
men to take part.

Intra-mural football has been a
fixture at State College for many
years. It can’t take the place of
inter-collegiate competition. but it
does give a greater percentage of the
male students a chance to partici-
pate. As the game is played here it
is a cross between touch and tackle.
The rules state that before the ball
carrier is downed the opposing player
must have laid both hands on the
runners seat. Also, sneakers are the
only type of footwear permitted on
the field. This cuts out all chances
for cleat wounds and speeds up the
game if the ground is hard.

Art Kaufman. assistant MAA head
wants the students to support the
league by turning out in large num-
bers for the game. He said he didn’t
care where it was, but that the sight
and sound of a cheering mass of
co-eds always seemed to spur the
players on to greater efforts.

Dickinson brought up an idea is
gaining much favor throughout the
school. That is, a soph-fresh rivalry
football game. Last year there
Weren’t enough soph men for such a
game and consequently the men
were unable to directly add to the
rivalry score of their classes. He
added that rivalry basketball would
be possible if the football deal goes
through.

Whatever decision is made on the
rivalry question the air will soon be
ﬁlled with footballs. cheers. groans.
et al, heralding the advent of an-
other scasorr of pigskin parading on
the Page Hall field. Those wishing
to sign up for the league may do so
on the MAA bulletin board by the
men’s locker room.

Lockers To Be Distributed

There has been a change in the
policy for handling lockers this year.
Miss Johnston, rather than Mr.
Dcyo. will be in charge of their
distribution. Freshmen. transfer
students. and grads will be able to
get lockers about the middle of
next week.

Further notice will be posted on
the door of Miss Johnston’s office.
The cooperation of the student body
is asked in keeping the newly clean-
ed locker rooms that way.

 

Four Tourneys

On MAA List
To Slorf Soon

— By George W. Hess

 

A long time ago some enterpris-
ing gent thought up the idea of
having tournaments. Times have
changed a bit, though, since lum-
bering giants in coats of mail went
knocking around the countryside
battering similarly clad and equally
cumbersome chums from the backs
of horses. In these enlightened
times we are much more interested
in proving our superiority over our
fellow men with such implements
as ping-pong paddles, pool cues,
tennis racquets and bowling balls.

Last year the lack of men cur-
tailed the tennis tourney to the ex-
tent that it was made an open af-
fair for both sexes. However, a
man did win it. Bob Ferber trounc-
ed Flo Garfall in a wild and wooly
game. With numerous sophomore
men returning and over thirty male
frosh on hand. chances are very
good that MAA will sponsor its own
tennis round-robin. With the frosh
as an unknown factor and with Fer-
ber not coming back. it looks like
Jim Minor will be the man to beat.

In ping-pong it was again Ferber
who romped home in front. Phil
Lashinsky gave him a terrific battle
in the finals before bowing in three
out of five games. Of last year's
contestants many have improved
their game and are already casting
greedy eyes on the championship.
Lashinsky and Dickinson now look
like the class of the competition.
Shades of Kiley ' ’

Pool last year found Art Kauf-
man and Three Guesses knocking
each other out for the title. We
finally won in a “hard fought, hotly
contested" game. A new freshman.
Bob Sorenson. shows the most prom-
ise of all the incoming cue critics.

Bowling was neglected by MAA
mainly because no one was terribly
hopped up over it at the time. Bob
Dickinson has promised to do all he
can to promote a bowling league or
tourney if enough fellows want it.
He suggested that all those inter-
ested in competitive bowling get in
touch with him through the stu-
dent mail or in person. He can
usually be found in the Commons.

The starting dates of all these
events will be published on this page
and will also be postcd on the MAA
bulletin board.

captain.
‘ Tennis tournaments, which have
always been the main event of the
fall season. will take place again
this year. Eleanor Durbeck. Virginia
Efflcy and Katherine Glavin are in

important place on the sports pro-
gram as WAA is working on ar-
rangements for several inter-college
games. All hockey enthusiasts will
have an opportunity to get some
practice on the Dorm Field every
Monday. Wednesday. and Friday
afternoon. Ann Mastrangclo and
Helen Slack arc co-captains.

New Prof. lnlr'igues Classes Wifh Tales ollhe Orient

With the mystic wonder of tho
Oricni still rich in her mcmorics. Dr.
Ethel E. Ewing. new Assistant Pro-
fessor of Political Science and
Economics. comes to State. Small
though she may be, Dr. Ewing has
behind her a wealth of experiences
and a treasure of knowledge of for—
cign countries that promises to make
her courses here at State “something
different."

Hailing from western Pennsylvania
Dr. Ewing has been on the go a good
part of her life. Muskingum College.
Ohio. granted her a BA degree;
Radclyi‘fc College in Cambridge,
Massachusetts awarded her a Mus-
tr-rs of Arts, and some time later,
she gained her PhD. in Cornell Uni-
versity. Ithaca. for extensive work
done in the field of the Far East.

But mcrcly studying the Far East
in American Universities was not

enough for this enthusiastic lover of
the Orient. In 1937 and ’38. Dr.
Ewing travelled through many of the
lands of the “yellow folks." Those
years. before the beginning of active
animosity between Japan and the
United States. proved to be the ideal
time for such research work as Dr.
Ewing planned to do. In the actual
wur areas. it was almost impossible
to travel but in all other sections.
travelling was still comparatively
safe and free.

As an eye—witness in Japanese
controlled territories and after living
in lhcm for a while. Dr. Ewing states
what We have so often heard but
chalked up to propaganda that the
policy of such controlled areas is
definitely one of stem exploitation.
Formosa. Korea. Munchuriu, and
Northern China wore all included in

Dr. Ewing‘s Far Eastern journey.
Later she went to India. Indo-Chinu.
Siam. and Malaya.

Stntc first met Dr. Ewing lust
spring when she lectured here to
many of the history and political
science groups. Students ltstcned
with interest to her graphic descrip-
tion of China and her all-expansch
knowledge of China's history. A
chronological list of the emperors of
the Chinese dynasties is just part of
the day's routine for this learned
scholar.

Although Dr Ewing conceals hcr
rurc experiences beneath a quiet. un-
ostcntutious attitude. State students
are looking forward to a full year—~
a year of lectures that will not be dull
because the “Prof” will not be quot-
ing "book-lamina" but will be speak-
ing from her own experience.

 

Music Council

Mary D. Alden. ’45, President of
Music Council, has announced the
