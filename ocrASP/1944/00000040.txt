Ramblers Win

  25-9 Against
‘Wea‘k Falcons

 

— By Joan Hylind

Hey! We’re going to quit school
and come back when that deluxe
edition of a Sports Lover’s haven is
no longer a “post-war plan.” Having
had one year of political science. we
considered ourselves an authority on
P.W. planning. As such. the stamp
of approval is put on the statistics
for the new gym.

Old Business

Didn’t we decide last year that
the meeting of the Student Associa-
tion was the backbone of democracy
at State? Wonder. then, why so
many upperclassmen took advantage
of the fact that no one was checking
up on them to cut Assembly, Friday?
Or. is democracy important only
when someone “threatens” it by in-
troducing a new idea?

For the benefit of the above-
mentioned. last week in asembly
Dr. Sayles presented plans for a new
gym complete with full-sized basket-
ball court. overhead bleachers, six
regulation bowling alleys, an indoor
swimming pool, more bleachers.
Outside, will be a baseball diamond
and a football field—if there’s room.
What the athletes of former years
couldn’t have done with a set-up
like that!

Digrcssion,No. 1

Let’s take a flyer into the future
and look in on a typical State scene
sometime after the duration plus.

We find Lotta Guff. she is the
senior who neglected gym during her
earlier years and who is now taking
the course every other period to make
up enough hours to graduate. Lotta
thought she could talk the Dean into
waiving the requirement when the
proper time came.

Now Lotta rushes up the stairs to
the roof of Draper. knocking over
three commerce students and a can
of paint on the way —— steps into her
Model T heliocoptcr. and is off. Ar-
riving at the sports palace, she hops
into her gym stilt. rolls ten straight
frames of gutter balls. plays a fast
and furious game of basketball,
changes into her bathing suit. swnns
the pool three times—from side to
side and is back in school in time
for her next class.

Back to Sports

We are cheered indeed, to learn
that hockey practice had such a
large attendance last week. This
sport has just recently come into
its own here at State. Since it has
been raised to the dignity of a
Rivalry sport. we feel that interest
in it will keep up. We confess to
a distinct awe of the mighty ones
who wield the sticks. They never
fail to amaze us by their speed and
endurance. Conclusion of the week:
Hockey is a bios game to watch.
All That Glitters

Last spring. in a flight of phan-
tasy, our esteemed colleague, George
Hess, spent 19 whole lines inform-
ing his public of inst which teams
in the American league were going
to end up in what positions. Here
is our boy‘s list:

1. New York
2. Chicago

8. Washington
4. St. Louis

Nothing donated, by our hero‘s
words. Detroit went right ahead to
come out on top of the league. St.
Louis, New York and Boston are
finishing in that order. Washing—
ton, in spite of Hess' burning faith
in its ability. is in the cellar posi-
tion at the moment. A word of en~
couragcmcnt. though. George. don't
let this temporary setback blight.
your career. We will undoubtedly
be needing mere spacc filler, come
next spring and you can try again.
Bye. Ifye. Bub.

It is sad to learn that Bob Dick-
inson will be leaving State soon to
enter the Navy. Bob's stay here has
been short but it was long enough
for him to show the athletic and
directive ability that led to his ap-
pointment as Director of MAA in
his Sophomore your. Dickinson had
a full program lined tip for the
fellows and was able to set: the start
of his football league. We'd like to
wish Bob lots of luck in the Navy.
Our best also goes to Art Kaufman.
new director of men's athletics.

 

Pike Runs Sixty Yards
Alter intercepting Pass

The offensively weak Falcons
went down to defeat at the hands of
a slow-but-sure Rambler team in
the initial game of the boys intra-
mural league football schedule
play-ed last Wednesday. The final
score was 25 to 9.

Ramblers Take Early Lead

Starting early in the first quar-
ter of the game the Ramblers took
the lead on a pass from Bob Dick-
inson to Harry Inglish and then
continued on their winning way
when Inglis caught another pass in
the same quarter to send the
Ramblers ahead 12-0.

The Falcons tallied in the secoan
quarter on a slow. ground gaining
attack when Bert Pike, husky back
of the Ramblers. was tagged behind
the goal line for a safety bringing
the score at the end of the ﬁrst half
to 12-2.

There was little doubt left at the
beginning of the third quarter that
the Falcon aggregation could hold
the superior Rambler team.

Again Pike intercepting a pass
and with the help of strong inter-
ference spurth 60 yards to tally in
the day’s outstanding play. The
Ramblers then lead with an 18 to
2 score.

Coming back in a last ditch at-
tempt to stay in the ball game Hal
Webber. Falcons leading backfield
man. spiraled a 40-yard pass into
the arms of Steve Sidebottom.
Falcons Fail To Score Again

This 6-pointer and a converted
point—after-touchdown was all the
scoring the Falcons did for the rest
of the day as the third quarter
ended.

At the opening of the last quarter
Bob Dickinson. one of the day's
best offensive men and the Ram-
bler's passer sowed up the game.
Back in pass formation Dickinson
shot a short pass to Bob Sorenson.
freshman, who took the ball across
from the Falcon forty yard stripe.
The attempted point after touch-
down was successful making the
score 25 to 9 in favor of the Rain-
blcrs who kept the lead.

The remainder of the game was a
see-saw of ground gaining and a
series of uncompletcd passes.

As the whistle blew the Ramblers
strode from Page Field victors an-
xiously awaiting today's encounter
against the Sheiks in what will
prove to be a rugged battle. The
contest starts at 4 P. M.

T948 Primed For Sports
With TWO Pro Sofibollers

Oh happy day! There are two
(count 'em) girls in the freshman
class that have actually played
softball before coming here. Do
you relize what that means? Do
you comprehend the significance
of such a statement? In case you
don’t. it means that the fellows
can play the females another soft-
ball game without worrying about
holding the score down.

Last spring such a game. if a
farce like that can be called a
game. was played, and the fellows
politely walked all over the fair
critters. This year it should be
different. The score should be
around 29 to 8 instead of 30 to 8.

Now if only a couple of basket-
ball players can be found . . .

This week we are beginning one
of a series of columns which will
feature a report on the athletic
prowess of seine of the outstanding
WAA members. Our personality for
this week is Mary Now ‘45 President
of WAA.

This energetic and vivacious per-
sonage came to us from Poughkccp-
sic with a Well rounded athletic
career. In high school. Mary took
an active part in all the usual ath-
letic activities offered. Here at
State she joined the “Crimson Tide"
and proved to be an enthusiastic
and advantageous opponent in
every contest against the "Blue
Devils" (so that‘s how they beat
‘46). In that same year. Mary was
captain of bowling and did her
share on the Psi Gain team which
won the bowling tourney. In the
spring of her sophomore year an
innovation was made in women‘s
sports—n soft ball league. and Mary
was co~captuin of soft ball. Speak-
ing of soft ball. her name appeared
on the list of sophomores who
represented the “Crimson Tide" in
its triumph over the fresh on the
soft ball field.

This may seem like a heavy
schedule but our heroine found time
to successfully complete the female
aquatic course rulalifylng her to be
a life—saving instructor.
llcckcy Enthusiast

However. Mary did not limit her
athletic. ability to this one your.
Last year she came back with re-
newcd vigor. Hockey began to in-
trigue her. As we browse through
the back issues of the NEWS. we hit
upon the headlines which acclaim
Now‘s enthusiasm for hockey at
State. She had been sent to a
hockey camp in the Poconos to
learn the latest techniques and rules
for State's fair stick-wieldcrs.

We should not fail to mention
that this week‘s chosen athlete also
keeps in form during," her summer
vacations. We gasped when We dis-
covorcd that she ventured to take
a trip from Poughkeepsic to Troy——
pedalling all of the 150 miles! l
The journey included the Berkshire
Mts forcing our fair truvclcr over a
pass which was six miles high!
Professional l’rowcss

This past summer Mary had an
opportunity to bring her soft ball
skills to the fore. She was catcher
on a team which was in a Women's
soft ball league.

As it closing note. we feel that we
can safely predict a successful year
for WAA under the capable leader-
ship of Mary Now.

Tennis Tournament

The annual WAA tennis tourna-
ment will get under wuy next Mon-
day. Flo Clurfull. ‘45. bus been the
defending champion since the Full

Koulmon Named
Athletic Head

Several changes in the set-up of
MAA's executiva control have taken
place this week. Monday, Robert
Dickinson enlisted in the navy. va-
cating the post of MAA Director.
To fill this vacancy, Arthur Kauf-
man was promoted from assistant
director to director. To complete
the circle Kaufman appointed
George Hess to the assistant direc-
tcr’s spot. Kaufman announced
that no changes were to be made
in the athletic program and that
all sports would go ahead as
planned. This means that the foot-
ball league will attempt to complete
its schedule and that there will be
basketball of some kind during the
winter.

During the student council meet-
ing Wednesday night it was decided
that the soph-l‘rosh rivalry football
game should be held on October 2nd.
This will give the class of '48 an
opportunity to organize a team, hold
practice. and get in shape generally.
This also applies to the sophomore
men, who will be advised as to de-
tails during the llCXt class meeting.

Campua Day will be the day for
another all-male rivalry contest. A
series of track events will take place
in connection with the rivalry ob-
stacle races which will start at ten
in the morning. The exact number
of points that will be awarded for
the track has not yet been decided.
but will be announced in the near
future.

Clough, Sanderson Up
In WAA V.P.El¢ctionv

Last year Peg Bostwick, ’45. was '

elected to the post of vice-president
of WAA. Miss Bestwick was also
elected to the presidency of New-
man Club which is a major office.
Under the major-minor office plan
no person can hold a major and
minor office at the same time. This
meant that Bostwick must give up
one or the other of her two posi-
tions. She gave up the vice-presi-
dency of WAA. leaving that office
vacant.

As a result WAA is holding an
election next Monday and Tuesday
to fill the vacancy. The voting will
take place in the lower hall of
Draper from 9:00 10 12:00. In or-
der to be eligible to vote each girl
must have a years credit in at
least one sport. This is business
held over from last year. the fresh—
men will not be allowed to vote.

The girls up for election are Mary
Sanderson and Betty Clough. both
seniors.

week the following nominations were
made:

Song Leader: Mary Telian. Audrey
Cox, and Dorothy Silvernail.

WAA Representative: Jean David-

assembly and will not be per—

mitted to reenter.

"He Took All Their Money
And He Leff Them Fla!”

“In the wigwam of the Etas. ."
The sorors had given themselves
up to sweet repose — sable night
reigned — the stillness was pro-
found —— et tout cela. Suddenly
there came a burst of light akin
to the aurora borealis or what
have you. The light came to rest
on the sleeping countenance of
one of the inmates. In answer to
a gently intoned, “Who is
there?" came a squeeking falsetto
insisting “It's Jane who always
comes in late." Enter chaos ——
after all. there’s no Jane in the
AE Phi house.

Upstairs, downstairs, pitter, pat-
ter. hi-diddle-diddle. avast mates
——”It’s a man! — $26.00 is missing
—call the police-—” and on into
the night.

Alpha Epsilon Phi has settled
back on it haunches into the
dull routine of college life. Hoot
mon, what a boring world it is.

 

 

 

 

Music Council
Elects Members
For 1944-1945

Mary D. Alden, ’45, President of
Music Council, has announced thrée
vacancies created in the organiza-
tion by members not returning to
school this year. Their positions
will be filled immediately.

Jean Chapman Snow, '45. will be
replaced by Elizabeth Cottrell, '45.
who was elected by Chorus. Can-
didates for the vacancy left by
Eunice Wood. ’45. are Nora Crumm.
’45. and Jean Offhouse. ’45. This
opening will be filled at Student
Association meeting today. Miss
Wood was elected to the Council as
a freshman under the old system.
Rosalind Ginsburg. ’46. has replaced
her as Secretary.

The Class of ‘47 will elect a new
representative to take the place of
Marilyn Mullin. ’47. who became a
member of Music Council under the
new system last year.

This your Music Council will pre-
sent two muslcal programs. an
Operetta. “Chimes of Norway." in
lieu of the usual Gilbert and Sul-
livan opcrettn. Lucille Kenny. '45.

dramatic part of the production.
and Dr. Charles F. Stokes. head of
the MuSic Department. will direct
the music. The Council also plans
to present a cantata entitled "Mag-
nificat." composed by Vaughn Wil-
linms.

Frosh! Sign Now! Be An FOB; Dean Res-trains

Activities Galore Will Floorish

“Sign up here for the FOle”
“By fixing your signature on this
line. you too can be a Myskania
member!"

Mid the hub-bub of chattering
chairmen and rushing rogues, the
frosh will withstand the pulling and
hauling bestowed upon them by
publicity agents of every organiza-
tion State has'ever seen. and end up
with their names on more papers
than they'll ever remember. And so.
Activities Day is launched.

Activities Day is, for the benefit
of the frosh, —— well, it’s a day of
activity. It all begins at 2 PM. on

October 7 when frosh will sign up

for the vari. us precarious organiza-
tions they are interested in, and
some they aren't. in the Commons.
As usual. the last sparks of rapidly
dying organizations will flit des-
perately around trying to light on
some obvious fresh, but as usual. the
latter will be scooped up by the long
spoon-like arms of the flashes of
the year and dipped gently. but
firmly. into the boiling blood of their
activities.

Raggeld and befuddled by now.
the frosh will see the banner cere-
mony for the first time (upperclass~
men for the second). They'll even
hear “Slackie” give a speech. It’s
unpredictable what message the

whims and witticisms of the Junior
President will convey, but we. do
know that the freshman banner will
pass from her protecting hands to
those of the frosh. Not to be out
done by the Juniors, Flo Garfall will
unroll the Senior banner in true
WAA style.

But the day has only begun!
There’ll be singing and dancing and
a slight intermission in which
students may attend to such busi-
ness as laundry, room-cleaning and
eating. (Oh. yeah!)

In the evening by the light of the
Bonfire. there’ll be cheers, sneers
and songs as State does a wee bit of
pep-rallying. Then. when there are
no more logs to be thrown, the
Seniors will lead the traditional
snake-dance around the dorm field
and parade back to the gym. Josie.
Umbrella Girl. Simon of the sophis-
ticated—it says here—Senior class.
will present the evening's entertain-
ment in the gym.

But like all good things. Activities
Day must come to an end sooner or
later and according to Residence
Council rules, it'll have to be sooner.
There'll be dancing in the gym in
the latter part of the evening until
upperclassmen go their merry ways
and fresh go home.

 

President's Reception
Tonight ln lnglc Room

President Sayles has announced
that his annual reception 1 or fresh-
men will be held tonight ln the
Ingle Room of Pierce Hall at 8:15
PM. Junior and Sophomore Stu-
dent. Guides have arranged to meet
their freshmen sisters and to take
them to be introduced to President
Sayles. This will also be an oppor-
tunity for the freshmen to meet the
other members of the faculty and
of the administration as well as
their own class members.

This event has long been known
by the members of the student body
as an outstanding occasion of their
freshman year. Its success has been
largely due to the genuine friend-
lincss and interest of all of the
faculty members in making the
newcomers to State feel at home.

The guide system of Juniors and
Sophomores, headed this year by
Joan Mather and Robert Sullivan.
Juniors, will culminate its formal
program of guidance to freshman by
this reception.

,lnlorinol Riyalry
To Insure Safety

"Rou h-ncch” Stunts
Arc lgui On Blacklist

Culminating many months of un-
restricted and unrestrained infor-
mal rivalry. Dr. Ellen G. Stokes,
Dean of Women. announced this
week that all» unorgaan rivalry
will be henceforth prohibited. Ac-
cording to Dean stokes. however,
the term “rivalry” has been mis-
used and miscontrued to pertain to
rough-neck activities in the group
houses. "Rivalry," as Dr. Stokes
defines it, “will continue as usual.
That is, such things as ordering
freshmen to use back stairs. taking
out mail. greasing door knobs, and
the like will be allowed. There will
be no upsetting of rooms or dunking
of students in showers or other
such pranks which may result in
injury to students or destruction of
property."

Dean Stokes has issued warnings
several times in the past years, sug-
gesting that rivalry in the group
houses be modified and limited to
certain time periods. Notice of the
discontinuance of informal rivalry
constituted a surprise for the two
participating classes who had al-
ready begun the annual inter-class
struggle. Dean Stokes contacted the
group houses during the week, con-
cerning the temperance of rivalry.
All-time High

According to Dr. Stokes, unorgan-
ized rivalry reached an all-time
high. Joseph Francello. former
President of the Class of '47, re-
ceived a not too moderate scalping
by members of the opposing class.
Inter-dorm raids were conducted
resulting in jam-smeared hair and
clothes liberally marked with lip-
stick, some of which proved unre-
movable. Pails of water were taken
into corridors and rooms and
thrown carelessly on individuals,
occasionally causing damage to the
furnishings and clothing.

Early and Late

Since September. quiet hours have
been violated several times as rival-
ry went beyond the half-hour lim~
itation. The crisis occurred when
some of the group houses were dis-
turbed at mid~nlght by the Sopho-
mores who seized freshmen and
threw them into tubs of cold water.

For the first time in many years,
unorganized rivalry will have no
place in college life. The official,
traditional rivalry will now have
complete control over freshmen and
Sophomore classes.

 

State To Entertain
Students From Potsdam

From October 18 to 20. State will
play host to sixty women and twelve
men from the Music Society of
Pottsdam State Teachers’ College.
During this time. they will sing and
play in an orchestra at a teacher's
convocation held in Albany.

The President of the College has
solicited the help of the group
houses on campus in caring for the
visitors.

The sorority houses will accola-
modate approximately 30 of the
girls. Group houses will take care
of the rest.

Anyone who has relatives in Al‘
bany can stay with them Wednes-
day and Thursday nights so that
guests can occupy their rooms.
Those who would not be incon-
vonlenced by doubling up with their
friends can also leave their rooms
for guests. Anyone willing to m-
lease his room should loavo a note
in Student Council mailbox.
