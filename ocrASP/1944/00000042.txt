Come Out, Come Out

In spite of eloquent appeals to the
female element to come out and
cheer for the intramural football
leaguers, the games remain practi-
cally spectatorless. Last week two
people and several assorted Milnites
saw the game. The men really would
appreciate some enthusiastic rooting.
They put on a good show. So, pick
your team, place a bet or two on
your favorite and come out to pro-
tect your investment. State, as a
college in wartime, is missing a lot
as far as the Rah, Rah type of col-
lege spirit goes. The intramural
league is an attempt to maintain
some degree of normality. We think
it is an attempt that would have
greater success if the girls would
show more interest.

Once Again

Once more the WAA tennis tour-
nament comes in for its share of
censure. The slim amount of time
alloted by the Albany weather is
fast running out and as yet no action
has taken place on the tennis court.
By now the situation has become
such that we do not scold WAA with
any malice aforethought, but,
rather, as the regular duty of the
Sport’s department. Every year, it
seems that the editor spends his
first five columns reviling WAA for
its conduct of the tournament and
his second five lamenting the fact
that the tournament was not con-
ducted more efficiently. The sacred
trust has been passed on to us and
we take up the torch.

Contrary to the STATE Common
News Bob Dickinson did not leave
“soon.” It may even be that the
Navy will not give the word until
after the Rivalry football game. We
. understand that the sophs are quite
elated at the news. A permanent
“committee to keep our fingers
crossed till after the game" has been
formed and is now holding daily
meetings.

Suggestion Dep’t.

A suggestion has come from an
alum now out in the "field." This
public spirited citizen proposes that
the student tax be raised to 21
dollars—the extra sheckels to go
into a fund to take a new picture
of Dr. Sayles. We support the
measure. Not that We object to the
present pose. It's just that a change
of scenery is always appreciated.
Intervarsity Football

The latest neWS on the MAA front
is startling to say the least. The
powers that be in the athletic field
have succeeded in getting together
enough of that rare species, male.
to play a touch tackle football game
with Sicna. For the sake of those
who were as surprised as we were
we repeat that this is a real-live
football game.

played a week from Sunday on the

Falcons Threin Shieks V

The first round of intra-mural
football games has been played and
all three teams are tied for the
lead. Each team has played two
games, winning one and losing one.

Last Friday the Ramblers and the
Shieks tangledin a tight, well play-
ed game 'that found the Shieks
winning 14-12. The Shieks’ margin
of victory came early in the game
when Bert Pike was caught behind
his own goal line and charged with
a safety.

The Ramblers fought their way
into the lead shortly after Pike’s
safety with a sustained drive down
the field that was climaxed when
McCarthy took Dickinson’s short
pass in the flat and went over for
the score. Weber's attempted pass
for the extra point was batted
down.

The second quarter was all for
the Shieks. They scored once on a
pass from Sullivan to Ingaiis and
were on their way to another one
when the half ended.

The third quarter was filled with
fireworks from beginning to end.
The Shieks kicked-off and the
Ramblers ran it back to their own
30 yard line. After an incompleted
pass, Dickinson faded and shot a
mighty heave all the way down to
the Shiek 20 where the ball bounced
off Sullivan and Ingaiis into the
waiting arms of Weber who carried
it over for the score.

Again the pass for the extra was
batted down and the Ramblers
kicked to the Shieks. They started
a sustained drive that fizzled on the
Rambler 12. After the Ramblers
had advanced the ball to mid-field.
the Shieks took over and scored
their last touch-down when Sulli-
van ran around left end for the
score.

Final Score

Wednesday afternoon the Falcons
showed much better form than they
did in their opener and took over
the Shieks in .a close game, 25-20.

The Falcons started fast and piled
up a 12-0 advantage before the
game was hardly under way. Their
first tally came when Dickinson
flipped to Weber in the flat who
went 20 yards for the score. Weber’s
pass for the point was wild. The
Shieks then received. but on the
first play Heinan fumbled and Hess
recovered for the Falcons. The
Falcons wasted no time cashing in
on their break. 0n the second play
from scrimmage. Weber threaded
the needle with a pass to Dave Leh-
man who smashed over for the
touch. The try for the point was
no good.

With a 12 point deficit staring
them in the face the Shieks opened
up with a running game that car-
ried them to the Falcon five yard
line where “Sparky” Vaughn scam-
pered off tackle to score. Sullivan's
pass for the conversion was knocked
down. This ended the scoring until
mid-way through the second period
when Sullivan took a pass from
Vaughn to tie up the game. They
broke the tie by converting on a
pass from Sullivan to Heinan.

The third period was compara-
tively quiet with only one score.
The Falcons regained the lead with
another pass play, Lehman taking
one from Dickinson. Lehman also
scored the extra point on a pass
from Weber.

In the last quarter the Shieks
and the Falcons both scored. The
Shieks' coming after Heinan faked
a pass and ran through the entire
Falcon team. Heinan also con-
verted. With only two minutes re-
maining in play Dickinson passed
to Weber for the winning six points.

 

Rivalry Football
Set For Monday

Monday afternoon will find rivalry
football returning to State after a
year lapse. Not since October 1942
has the Page Hall field resounded to
the cheers of rival classes as they
urged their men‘to greater and still
greater efforts. That day in 1942
found the Red Raiders of ’45 storm-
ing through the Blue Devils of ’46
to win 27-6. Then came Uncle
Samuel and off went the men of
’46. This left the athletes of ’47
with no opponents and no game.
This year, however, ’47 has enough
husky men back to make up a pretty
fair team, and will attempt to show
the fresh what is what.

The Opponents

The frosh at this writing appear
to have a fast, light team with a
good passing attack. They plan to
mix in a running game with Ray
Cocusi and team captain “Sparky”
Vaughn doing most of the ball toting.
Both men have had experience in
high school football and will be hard
to stop.

The sophs have a definite edge
over the fresh in weight and have
several fast men. They have a strong
passer in Harold Weber who has
uncorked some gargantuan heaves in
intra-mural games so far this year.
The running game of the sophs will
probably be built around Bert Pike
who startled everybody with a 60
yard runback of an intercepted pass
in the first intro-mural game of the
year.

Both teams are hepped up at the
prospect of winning undying glory
for both themselves and their re-
spective classes. The freshmen want
to show the world that they aren’t
the Joe Cruds that everyone makes
them out to be and the sophs want
to prove that the fresh are just that.

The game itself will be played
under the official intra-murai rules.
Most of the player are already
familiar with these and those that
are not should contact their team
captains and learn the rules.

In choosing a referee it was de-
cided that Dave Lehman, a senior.
would be the most unbiased in his
decisions. Lehman has played foot-
ball for several years at State and
knows the regulations as well as
anyone in the school.

Again the cry goes out for moral
support for the players. Both the
sophs and the fresh should remem-
ber that points will again be award-
ed for the best cheering class at the
various athletic events.

Sanderson New V.P.,__
Tennis Season Begins

l

As a result of the voting which
took place this week, Mary Sander-
son ’45 was elected to the office of
Vice President of WAA.

Next week. as the tennis tourney
gets under way, tennis will resume
its predominate place on the fall
sports program. A schedule of the
matches has been placed on the
WAA bulletin board stating that the
first round of matches must be
played off by next Monday.

As we look over the list of players,
we find the names of several vet-
erans of former tennis tournaments.
Among these are: Flo Garfall ’45,
J0 Simon '45, Peg Bostwick '45, El-
leen Shoup ’46, Betty Rose Hilt ’47.
and Molly Cramer, ’47. This year
the names of only three freshmen
appear on the schedule.

Garfall and Simon, due to former
prowess on the courts, are recog-
nized as the two strongest con-
tendants for the cup, but since the
inle-up shows several other hard-
ened contestants, the final outcome
is unpredictable.

Due to the fact that the Sayles
Hall gym is no longer available for
WAA use, badminton and volley
ball will take place in the Page Hall
gym on Tuesdays and Thursdays at

p.m.

Lti Saving Class

Featured Soon

Lifesaving will be offered as a

part of the regular WAA sports
program. Classes will start on
Monday. October 8. It has been
suggested that those who are inter-
ested, try to get their meals early-—
by five o’clock if possible—since
it is necessary to begin class
promptly at seven.

The Jewish Health Center on
Washington Avenue, between the
White Tower and the State Educa-
tion building will be the scene of
activities. There will be no cost to
State College students.

Junior Lifesaving is net a pre-
requisite to the course. The only
difference between Junior and Se-
nior Lifesaving is the age group.
A Junior badge may be obtained
between the ages of twelve and
seventeen. After seventeen you may
work for a Senior Lifesaving badge.

All who wish to take this course
may sign up on the WAA bulletin.
board. WAA credit will be given.

Everyone interested in swimming
or who desires to indulge in a pleas-~
ant, practical sport is urged to sign
up.

larity.

The rules of Campus Commission
will be read by Leah Tischler, ’45,
who is Grand Marshal. Florence
Gurfall, President of Student Asso-
ciation, will announce the complete
Activities Day schedule. During the
entire assembly, the class banners
will be hung on the backdrop of the
stage. These will also be used in the
Banner Ceremony tomorrow.

War Council’s Resolution

A financial resolution introduced
in last week’s assembly by Sunna
Cooper. ’45. will be voted upon today.
The resolution reads as follows:
Resolved: that $100 be given to War
Activities Council from the surplus
of the Student Asociation Budget
for the year 1944-45 to cover the
cost of mailing Dr. Jones' service
letter.
Cheers Presented

Since the Pep Rally ‘5' this morn-
ing’s attraction. most of the program
will be concentrated toward this
end. In addition to introducing
several new cheers, songs will be
sung including the “State Fight
Song" and “We’re the Gang from

Student tax was increased to $20, members of the

Class of ’44 signed pledges, and it was suggested that the
proceeds from the 1944-45 “Big Eight” and ensuing “Big
Eights” be turned into this Student Union Fund. Popular
vote sanctioned this turn of events.

However, a few weeks before the plans for a Student Union
were introduced into Assembly, the student body was asked
to make a decision concerning the subsequent distribution of

the 1943-44 “Big Ten” money.

A bond had already been pur-

chased to cover the cost of a field ambulance, but in 12 years
that bond would reach maturity, and $2500 would be turned
back to the Student Association. It was up to the students to
decide into what channels this money would be promulgated.
Their decision was to put the $2500 into scholarship money
for a veteran or child of a veteran of World War II. At the
time, there was little discussion and almost no opposition to

this proposal.

The fact remains that this is a State College and therefore

tuition-free and inexpensive.

In addition, utilization of the

funds for scholarships will affect only a few students in com-
parison to the number enrolled.

If so desired, Student Association can have this motion

rescinded, and vote to place

the $2500 toward a Student

Union—a project that is imperative, that will add prestige to
the College, and that will reach, not only a few, but every
single member of Student Association!

Music Council
Features Stokes
In First Concert

Music Council. headed by Mary
Dorothy Alden, ’45. is sponsoring a
Faculty Concert in the Page Hall
Auditorium Thursday at 8:30 P. M.,
featuring Dr. Charles F. Stokes,
Professor of Music. assisted by Mar-
garet Anderson Stokes, pianist.

This is the first of a series of
musical programs to be presented
by Music Council in the coming sea—
son. including the annual Operetta
now in rehearsal. There will be no
admission charge for the event. and
Miss Alden has announced that both
the student body and the general
public are cordially invited to be the
guests of Music Council. The con-
cert will be followed by a reception
for all in the Lounge.

Dr. Stokes. who will play selections
for both the violin and viola. entered
the faculty of State last year. He
was formerly in charge of music
education at the Cincinnati Con-
servatory of Music. where he received
his musical training and also did
gruduntc work. Dr. Stokes was in-
troduced to the student body when
he directed the Operatic Society in
its production of The Mikado. This
oporcitn was the first ever accom-
panied by 11 State College orchestra.

Mrs. Stokes, who will accompany
her husband at the piano, was for-
merly Director of Music at the
Redford School For Girls, El Peso,
Texas. She was graduated from the
Cincinnati Conservatory of Music
and also studied at the Curtis Insti-
tute. Philadelphia.

This concert marks the first local
appearance for this duo, who have
appeared in recitals in Ohio, Kon-
tucky. Arkansas, New Mexico, and
Texas in previous years.
