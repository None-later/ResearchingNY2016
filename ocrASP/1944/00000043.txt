"This, Our Generation"

This, our generation, is a lazy one. In comparison
to the rugged living allocated to our forefathers, and
even our fathers, we have been swathed in an exist-
ence of luxury. We have been pampered, and soft-
ened, and exposed only to those things which require
but a minimum of energy.

Our life has come too easy, and our set of values
has changed. Five cents in a subway, and ten cents
on a bus will take us a reasonable distance. We
think no more of picking up a telephone and dialing
a number than we think of stopping to greet a person
on the street.

Inventions doubtlessly are marvelous things, but
sadly enough, their entrance has made our life easy,
and in making our life easy, it has made us com-
placent. It is regrettable to cast a backward glance
and witness the consistent shifting of emphasis onto
the material side of things. Where the dollar is all-
important, and a good heart or a conscience is a
sideline.

It is disheartening to realize that this is a world
of mammon where people believe that money can
buy anything worth havingﬂonly there are no
price-tags attached to the higher ideals in life.

We’re afraid of work; we might as well face it.
There are millions like us, easily deflated, easily
enthused, and we think we‘re wonderful. We think
we can take life on the chin, but we can’t. We lack
a certain stability and a definition of purpose.

The only peoples of our generation who can mea-
sure up are the men in service who are now fighting
on foreign soil for the preservation of our kind of
life. in their minds, the American way is an ideal
which they expect somc day to find tangible.
'l‘hcy’vc built plans. 'l‘hcir eye is to the future.

It’s these men we’ll have to answer to. They’ve
been hardened to life, and we’re soft. They happen
to be the better of the two. \‘V'c’ll have to tell them
how we suffered. how we rolled bandages, gave
blood, read the newspapers, bought bonds, and
rcminisced. And probably, the latter will be the
only statement worth its weight in truth.

You can’t lie to men who risked their lives for you.
You can only disappoint them. You never bother-
ed to find out where 'l‘arawa was, you couldn’t give
your blood, you hated to spend your evenings roll-
ing bandages, and you let somebody with more
money buy the war bonds.

Victory is in the not-um-distant future. America
has been less touched by the war than any other
country, and we the Americans are not grateful in
the fullest extent of the word. We haven’t seen
lives tossed to the winds without charge.

We’ve been spoiled, protected. We're a lazy gen-
eration, and our minds, as of putty, can be molded
into any direction. ()f only one thing can we be
sure. When the boys come marching home, a certain
generation is going to have to grow up in a hurry.

'We'yor been alondered! Rivalry
spirit? We have it! The sophomores
hare felt iton'nd will feel more!

We shall begin by recounting the

- tale of another night in the dorm.

,It was hardly a dull thud that shook
Pierce Hall on the night of Septem-
ber 28. The halls rang with the
battle cry of ’48—“Geronimol” The
Sophomores quaked—we saw them
run! Organized, en masse, the
Yellow Peril bore down on the scat-
tering Green.

In fright, many took refuge in a
Sophomore room and, With the
phenomenal power known to be pro-
duced by terror, they held the door
against our onslaught. Soon we
were rewarded in our thirst for
battle and revenge by a slight rally-
ing on the part of the Sophs. When
they were ready to fight, we prompt-
ly went into action and thoroughly
doused the Sophs who were vainly
struggling to maintain some of the
“Fight and Pep" they sing about.
Many of their once proud leaders
emerged from the showers drenched
and shaken. It was '48 that ran
through the halls which had seen
frosh victory with their triumphant
cry—“Geronimol” Yes — ’47 felt our
spirit that night, or do they refuse to
remember?

In regard to the propaganda “a
night in the dorm” of the STATE Cot.-
Luon News of September 29, written
with obvious malice, we have this
to say. The article seems to build
the entire rivalry spirit of ’47 and
what they erroneously call lack of
'48 spirit on the one incident of their
attacking two sleeping fresh and of
their seeking revenge for a display
of '48 spirit on one freshman. This
incident hardly seems proof of their
claimed superiority of spirit.

Another thing—we were new and
inspired by the ideal of fair rivalry
regulated by the rules presented to
us. We are a little older and wiser
now. At first the ideal shook on its
pedestal and threatened to fall when
we viewed a few of the '47 tactics
of rivalry. However, in kindness
and tolerance, we shall pass over
this phase of our education to
rivalry.

To the Editor: I

We don’t want money. We don't
even want your blood. All we want
is a little‘ spirit, Sophomore girls.
Last week, for the first time in two
years, the freshman and Sophomore
men had a chance to really partici-
pate in rivalry. So what happens?
Nothing.

We realize the football game wasn't
a professional job, but we tried and
would like to feel that you appre-
ciated the attempt anyway. Fresh-
man women turned out in swarms to
cheer their side on, but they out-
numbered the Sophomore women
terrii'ically. We won the game, but
the frosh men were in much higher
spirits after it was over. Why?
Because they had their women out
there pulling for them, telling them
they were doing okay, win or lose.

We realize that we constitute only
a small part of '47 and that our part
in rivalry is limited to that propor-
tion, but we would like to know that
we are not ignored because there are
so few of us. We’d like to know
that you will accept the little we
have to offer . We don’t expect you
to slaam to us. Just a little backing
at the events we participate in
would do the trick very nicely. In
addition to what it does for us, your
cheering may help us win a few extra
rivalry points.

Think It over, Sophomore Women.

Thanks,
The Sophmen

 

You saw our spirit at the rivalry
football game and you certainly
heard it! Our boys didn’t win, but
they knew we were right there
behind them and that, win or lose,
we were proud of them. We realize
the cost of that lost game, but it
couldn’t dampen our spirit and our
pride in '48. We promise you a con-
tinuance of this undefeatable spirit!

We hope we have shown you that
freshman spirit is high and will stay
high. Just watch it! Let us shake
hands, '47. May the best class win
(and there Is no better class than
’48).

Geronimo!

The Freshmen

 

saturated

 

Long, long ago we dreamed. A
kind lady gave us, State College, a
beautiful mansion anda key. The
door swung open and we entered,
walked knee-deep In the soft rugs
and explored each room, finally
selecting just the right corner for a
pleasant nap. State settled down to
many an idle hour’s dream of life
In the big mansion.

This spot for gaiety, that one for
an hour of restful music, and here
an office. there another—a whole
houseful of dreams for a student
Union. The magic words were shout-
ed and we awoke to plan and to in-
vestigate. How was such a union
run? What did other shoots do?
How much would It cost? How im—
portant to the student body?

We found out: At that time a
Student Union was considered imu
practical. That was four years ago.
a year later Farrell Mansion was
turned into a women’s dormitory,
and today there are about thirty
women housed therein.

Four years ago We turned our
pockets inside out and scrutinized
budgets. Well, a Student Union had
been a pleasant dream and a penni-
les venture. And until last May no
one dreamed again.

Now We haVe a housing shortage.
a mansion for thirty women, and a
good round sum of $6,000 laid by for
Student Union plans. How long to
keep on dreaming?

We're not quite sure we want to
pay six dollars per year until we
graduate for something we'd like to
have but shall never see till long
after we leave school. Unless the
Student Union In born In Farrell
House. It must be shelved along with
other post-war plans for expansion
of the College. Pest-war building
will not begin with the rounding up
of the war criminals nor the day
after that. Were we to count tho
years until a Union building could
be constructed. there would be many,
probably enough to make us forget
the whole project.

There's another thing to be con-

 

sidered. Assuming that we are so
beneficient that we will give a Stu-
dent Union building to those who
will enter College years from now,
should we not decide whether they
would prefer a white or pink ele—
pliant? Kindly old ladies often give
away snuff-boxes and frilled petti-
coats that Were in fashion In their
day. A Student Union was in vogue
when ‘41's grand old seniors walked
out and evidently Is In good taste
today.

It has been written that returning
veterans who now attend colleges In
this country are objecting,r to certain
required courses . . . and . . . [micr-
nilics. Just another case of the men
who have seen a world and cannot
confine themselves. Though wo
shudder. the old order chungcth,
or would like to. But a Student
Union, that wonderful dream mn—
terial-future generations will cry
for it! Come. now. let's be Intelli-
gent.

Too, Student Council tonintlvoly
places the post-war Stunt-lit. Union
building In the vicinity of the Alum-
ni Residence I'ltlllS. When State
College moves out of the Commons
and News Office. It must. perforce
congregate between classes blocks
away from the school buildings with
the exception of the post-war gym—
nasium. ’

Please, then. can't \ve open wide
the doors of Farrell House seine your
soon? Let the conunltteo of four,
chosen to search the mansion for
creeks and cracks, Investigate thor-
oughly and announce: A Student
Union, housed In Farrell. ls deemed
practical, possible, and probable.

For a consldcrably smaller sum,
the Student Union could begin to
function and prove itself agreeable
to thoso who will enter State. Then
We would fear loss that come—upon-
n peacetime there would be a bonu-
tlful new building which students
would rather leave empty.

—by KIPPY MARSH

You are a senior. You may hate the sound and sight
of What there it is. Like death and taxes It's always
with you and like long dresses and your first corsage,
it always sneaks up on you.

Underclassmen consider the word Senior as a syno-
nym for an advanced state of senility. These healthy,
virile young creatures bestow looks of pity upon you.
open the doors lest you collapse of fatigue, shut the
windows lest you die of exposure. Bent backs, bifocals
and that harassed look are regarded as familiar traits
of the Senior.

To compensate for these overwhelming odds, there
are a few attendant advantages. Seniors, like tottering,
childish wrecks of eighty, may pull out their cherished
memories of a past Golden Age without being
socially ostracized. This advantage I would like to
claim. I want to take all of you back to December,
1941, when the class of '45 sat In the Rogues Gallery,
thought; that a trot was no more than a meaning for
gallop, and wondered which sorority they would join.
We were babies. We were the transition class — from
peace to war.

From peace to war. December 7. 1941. And now
December 8, 1941 at noon — the President of the United
States to declare that a state of war has existed be-
Lweent the United States and Japan.

Eleven o’clock classes are over. From Spanish and
Hygiene. Calculus and Ed 10 pour hundreds of students.
The slow line begins to the Assembly Hall. There is a
low undercurrent of talk, the rattle of seats, the wave
of freshmen to the gallery —— familiar sounds of a col—
lege assembly. But now a hush begins to fall upon
the audience. The students settle in their seats and
wait with sharp, focused attention. There is the shrill.
quick blare of the radio, a pause, and then the final
sound~—the voice of the President of the United States.

There is not a sound In the Assembly save that
quiet, steady voice. Every face Is set as if in a mold.
For It Is not until this moment that every student
realizes the full and horrible meaning of the unintel-
ligible reports which he heard the night before. Last
night there was the Algebra test and History home—
work and the stockings to be washed. Now there is
only the steady drone of a voice and the pinched.
beaten look upon the faces of those who are older
and have seen another war. Now there Is only a
sudden panic and an overwhelming sense of loneliness.
Now there is only the boy next to you with hunched
shoulders and an Intent, concentrated seriousness. All
of them sweep over you In a sudden rush of feeling
which will come to you again and again — when you
say goodbye to the fellows and when you salute a flag
with six golden stars. Golden stars engraved upon the
heart of a college.

"Council Reports
.IOn- Union Plans

investigation at Farrell
To Start immediately

Student Council meeting Wednes-
-day resulted In appointments to
the Election Committee and a re-
port on the activities of the Student
Union Committee.

Florence Garfall, ’45, President of
Student Association, announced the
following appointments to election
Committee: Helen Stuart, ’45,
Chairman, Mayola Thayer, '45, J0-
sephine Maggie and Georgette Dunn
Juniors, Eunice Golden and Edna
Sweeney, Sophomores. Miss Garfall
also announced that the curtains
will be put up in the Commons in
the near future. They are already
up in the cafeteria.

Union Committee Meeting

The committee for Student Union
will meet with Dr. John M. Sayles,
President of the College, and Dr.
Ralph Beaver, Assistant Professor
of Mathematics, Wednesday at 3:30
PM. in Dr. Sayles' office. The com—
mittee ls composed of Dr. Sayles
and Dr. Beaver, representing the
administration and the faculty; Flo-
rence Gal'fnll and Robert Loucks,
Seniors; Flora Conan and Kathryn
Kendall, Juniors; and Marjorie
O’Gl'ady. ‘47.

According to Miss Garfall, the
consensus of opinion so far is that
Farrell House will not be adequate
for a Student Union. A full report
will be given to Student Association
at a later date. Whether or not
Farrell can be used depends upon
the engineers report. Students are
welcome and urged to inspect the
house tIi-cmseIVes.

Student Union Fund

The Strident. Union fund to date
totals $6,622 In cash. This figure
does not; include the pledges from
the Class of '44 which will be col-
lected in February.

After the Inspection, If Farrell
House is found to be inadequate,
Student Union may be built In the
vicinity of the dorms. Out-going
Senior classes and recent. alumni
will be contactch for contributions.

Manda Warns Frosh
For Second Offense

Paul Vaughn. ‘48, has been report-
ed twice to Myskania by members
of the Sophomore class for entering
the door before an uppcl'classman.

This constitutes a violation of
Tradition 3, which states that when
two or more students of different
rank enter a building or any room
of a building at the same time,
deference must be shown to tipper-
classmcn.

The penalty of a first offense Is
a warming; from Myskanla. The

"CrimoIDoes Not Pay ll!” '
Guilty Sophomore Repenis

Has anyone heard the latest
ascapade of a certain Sophomore
who recently honoured an item
from a local night spot? It seems
a group of young ladies from the
dorm went out one night. Now
all of the ladies thought each of
the other young ladies was also
a lady, but in their midst was a.
damsel who hadn’t read her
Emily Post or listened to her
mother, or something. This little
lass happened to be a glass col-
lector, and the minute the waiter
turned his back, she popped a
little glass into her bag and left
ahead of the rest.

The waiter, who was a very
wise man, quickly upped to their
table. Quoth he, “Give with the
glass or a dollarl”

The rest of the ladies couldn’t.
see why they had to pay a buck
just because their friend was a
klcptomaniac, so they paid the
bill and ran out the door.

A minute later, a lone figure
crept stealthily into the night
club and over to the table the
ladies had occupied.

A pocketbook was opened ——
there was a flash and a bang.
"Didn't want your old glass any-
how!" she mumbled as she slunk
out the door.
