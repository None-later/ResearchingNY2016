The prophets of doom, who last
week . Were eulogizing over the
"dead" class of ’48, can put the
sack-cloth and ashes away in moth-
bails for the duration. From the
huge numbers of fresh who turned
out for the Rivalry football game,
We’d‘say that obituaries were a bit
premature. If you have no spirit
you don’t sit on the damp grass
while the cold October winds have
their way with your coiffure just to
cheer your team on. You don’t
shout at the top of your lungs for
a solid hour. You don’t make up
cheers and send three of your
peppiest member out to lead them.
You don't walk away from a defeat
saying, "They won this time, but
NEXT time . . ”

It’s unfair to judge’ the fresh on
their performance during the first
few weeks of school. They have no
organized leadership. Getting ac-
quainted, attending the numerous
receptions, buying books, writing
letters home, take up most of the
24 hours alloted to a freshman each
day.

In time, however, the fog lifts. The
freshmen learn what Rivalry is all
about. That's when someone in-
variably decides that unorganized
Rivalry has gone far enough. Nu-
merous people write letters to the
editor, upperclassmen drag out the
gory tales of Rivalry when they
were freshmen, they sigh for the
godd old days when a ducking in
Washington Park lake was the ac-
cepted. inevitible lot of the fresh
president. But life can be beautiful.
they say, and we must try to make
it so, mustn’t we?

Bulletin-Happy

We never thought there would
come a time in our young lives
when the sight of a WAA bulletin
board would thrill us, change our
whole outlook on life. But leave us
face it. Seeing the long lists of
people who have: signed up for life-
saving and hiking gaveus a special
glow. We are looking forward to
much of interest from these two
departments in the near future.
Life-saving, a comparative new-
comer on the WAA scene, has gain-
ed rapidly in popularity. It has the
advantage of being practical as well
as good exercise. Many of the for-
mer pupils have spent enjoyable
and profitable summers rescuing
hometown folk from local pools.
Have you noticed the tans some of
these people have acquired? And,
what's this we hear about swimming
being oh so good for the figure.
Esther Williams is doing all right as
exhibit number 1.

There are not quite as outstand-
ing endorsements for hiking but we
can strongly recommend the sport
as a basis for all other athletics.
Egad, Tennis

It begins to look as if maybe the
tennis tournament is going to go
against all sports department tradi-
tion by getting itself completed on
time. We are willing to publicly.
and in print to apologize for all
slurs against the fair name of ten-
nis. when and if the contest is suc—
cessful. We will spend reams of
paper extolling the virtues of the
sport. the contestants, the winners,
the captains, WAA, etc. Give us a
champ and we‘ll do the rest.

Bob Dickinson will probably go
down in history as the only man to
make a column three weeks in a
row but we want to wish him luck
(since again—«he’s really gone this

me.

 Wits: Stors’ior '47;
Scores on interception

The Sophomores drew first blood
of the 1944-'46 rivalry when they
toppled the freshmen in football,
7-0. This game marked the return
of rivalry football, after a lamented
lapse of two years. Both teams had
pointed for the game for over two
weeks and were raring for action.
The result was the toughest con-
test of the year. Hard running,
sloppy but vicious blocking, inter-
cepted passes and booming punts
furnished thrill after thrill for the
colorful crowd of girls that saw the
battle.

Rough and Tough

The game opened with the fresh
doing the honors by kicking off.
Hansen did the booting and got off
a good one that carried almost to the
Soph goal line. Pike took the ball
and ran it back to his own 35 be-
fore being tagged. From this point
on the game settled into a quiet
siii'gfest that furnished plenty of ac-
tion, but no scores until the third
period when the Sophs manufac-
tured their only score of the game.

Mid-way through the second pe-
riod the Sophs made their first bid.
With the ball on the frosh 30, Pike
slashed off tackle and went tearing
through the line for a touchdown.
Sullivan called the play back be-
cause Pike left the ground when he
reached the line of scrimmage. This
was called “unnecessary roughness”
which resulted in a five-yard penalty
for the Sophs and took the punch
out of their attack.

Fresh Bid, Sophs Score

The frosh threatened to score
several times, but only once did they
really come close. Early in the third
stanza they had first down and goal
to go only to be hurled back by the
hard-charging Soph line and finally
lost the ball on downs.

The big break of the game came
at the end of the third quarter when
Jim Brophy of the fresh passed
from his own 30 and Hal Weber
intercepted for the Sophs. He
caught the ball on the mid-field
stripe and with beautiful blocking
streaked down the sideline for the
score. They made it 7~0 a few mo-
ments later as Bob Dickinson ran
through the frosh for the extra
point.

Take a Bow, Boys

Individual stars were lacking. but
there are some that should be men-
tioned. For the fresh it was
“Sparky” Vaughn and Jim Brophy.
Vaughn for his nice running and
Brcphy for passes that would have
been great if he could have had
protection.

The Sophs had Bert Pike and
Harold Weber to brag about. Plkc
did some rugged blocking, the one
he threw on Sorenson after Weber’s
interception probably won the game
for the Sophs. Weber was a bul-
wark on defense in addition to scor-
ing the only touchdown. Bob Dick—
inson had tough luck in his last
game here. He completed only one
out of nine passes attempted.

Slate Favored
To Detect Siena
In Tili Sunday

An inexperienced, raw but favor-
ed State College touch-tackle team
will face an invading Siena College
juggernaut this coming Sunday at
Beaverwyok Park.

State is accepting a Siena chal-
lenge. Each team will have six
men. The men of State have been
trying to mold a heavy and power-
ful team to deem the boys from
Siena.

State will go into Sunday’s fray
minus the passing arm of Bob Dick-
inson who left for the navy and
whose herculean heaves will be
sorely missed.

Hal Weber will be relied on to
step into Dickinson’s shoes and do
most of States passing.

Pike and McCarthy are State's
best bets in the blocking depart-
ment.

“Sparky” Vaughn, shifty and
light, may start in the backfield
along with Weber on the offensive.

Dave Lehman and Ray Cacuzzi
willt probably occupy the other line

as s.

Thus State meets Stone with a
hodge-podge of material, inexperi-
enced but willing and ready to fight
for a hard victory over the warriors
from Siena.

If the statesmen can capitalize on
its heavy line, it can be counted on
to give Slena a hard fight and if
it can’t. it will meet with a lot of
trouble.

Slcna claims a light and thus
fast six-man aggregation that may

,prove too much for State on the

offensive.

The Sieneans have been in con-
stant practice for the last Week
shifting their positions on the line
and backfield and looking for the
most powor they can muster.

Sicna is outweighed on the aver-
age by State but what they lack in
the weight department they hope
to make up in speed and aggressive—
ness.

Hansen. Sorenson. Inglis, Brophy.
Koblcna, and Bollres will provide ad-
ditional material for the State six.

All of State's strength is being re-
cruited from the intramural league
ranks.

As this is being written all indica-
tions point to a close battle with

State slightly favored.

Attendance figures are estimated
to reach five hundred cheering fans.

 

MAA Sponsors Sister-Clem
Tilt On Page Field» Today ‘

Page Field today. will be the
scene of a sister-class rivalry
game that will feature the com-
bined talents of ’48 and ’46
against the strength of '45 and
'47

The gridiron still smoldering
with the memories of ,Monday’s
Frosh-Soph rivalry tilt, (Yes, the
Sophs won 6-0) promises to ex-
hibit one of M.A.A.s outstanding
events of the year in this game.

The ’48 and 46 combine has
been designated at Team 1 and
the '45 and ’47’ers as Team 2.

Team 1 will no doubt have a
much lighter but shiftier team
and will have to resort almost
totally on their passing talent.

cam 2 will outweigh Team 1
nearly 50 lbs. per man and as a
result will have both passing and
running power at its use.

D&A to Present

Famous Mimic
Friday, Page Hall

Ruth Draper To Portrey
Variety Oi Sketches

Dramatics and Arts Council, head-
ed by Martha Sprenger, ’45, will
present Ruth Draper, the “electrify-
ing mistress of the monologue,” to-
morrow evening at 8:30 P. M. in the
Page Hall auditorium.

On January 20, 1920, she gave her
initial performance on the stage of
the Aeolian Hall in London. She
trouped throughout England and
Scotland that year, doing recitals and
headlining on variety programs. She
appeared on one bill preceded by a
tame sea—lion act, and often recalls
her one on that particular occasion:
it consisted of the soft padding of a
seal’s feet by her dressing room door.
After her successful English debut,
she went on to conquer new worlds.

Ruth Draper

 

Miss Draper. internationally
known for her solo-dramas is now
on tour of the United States after
appearing in North and South Amer-
ca and Europe. In May of 1940, she
played South America, adding one
performance to her regular schedule
for the benefit of the Red Cross.
Returning to the U. S., she made
joint appearance for two weeks with
her famous dancer nephew. Paul
Draper, in New York, Boston. Phila-
delphia, Washington, and other
cities.

This unique artist has been termed
a monologist. rcciter, diseuse, im-
personator. and even an elocutionist,
but she prefers to be known as a
character actress. Her repertoire
includes 5'7 characterizations and her
dialects include French. Spanish,
Italian, German. Scandanavian.
Egyptian, and Japanese. All of Miss
Draper's sketches are her own crea-
tions, a few taken from actual ex-
periences. but most of them drawn
from her lntentivc understanding
and observation of people—an un—
conscious record oi‘i mprcssions of
types and locale.

Stale Convocation To Bring
’The Pause Thai Refreshes'

Teachers meet in Albany!
Shake out the welcome mats! On
Thursday and Friday, October 15
and 16, N.Y.S.T.C. will be host to
hordes of teachers from all over
the state.

In honor of their arrival, and
due to the fact that many teach-
ers and students expressed a de-
sire to attend the conferences, the
administration has announced
that classes will not meet during
the convention.

This may be sad news to the
student who already has done his
assignment for Thursday and Fri-
day, but to the rest, it will prove
a refreshing “pause from the
semester’s occupations."

Myskanio Plans
V-Doy Service

In preparation for V-Day, Mys-
kania has released a plan for a ser-
vice to be held on the day victory
over Germany is announced. Since
such plans can only be tentative,
only the service itself is definite.
However, the plans thus far are as
follows. If the news comes before
5 P. M. on any school day, students
should assemble in Page Hail audi-
torium. If the announcement should
be made at night, the service will be
held at 9 A.M. the next morning in
Page. If the news should come over
a weekend, the same directions will
hold true for the following Monday
morning.

Tire order of the service is as
follows:

Polish Up The Welcome Mat,-
'44 Returns To Herald QUeen

Trumpet blow—blow it loud and
blow it strong, for tomorrow we her-
ald our new Queen! Surrounded by a
court of beautiful lasses, Queen X
will be crowned to ascend her regal
throne. Old Father Time has once
again delivered the day of days——
Campus Day. With that comes
glamour for us here at State, moved
by the sensational thrill of the
moment. Amidst all this emotion,
let's remember those who have gone
before us and have come back to
celebrate too.

Tomorrow. some may look about
with a questioning glance. wondering
who the vivacious. blondc WAC
Private is. Upperelassmen will know
Pat. now Pvt. Latimer, and greet
her with a warm welcome. For the
benefit of the frosh, “our Pat" was
last year's Quceu~our queen, always
beautiful and beloved.

Many strange faces will be
glimpsed in the crowds. Strange to
us now. familiar a year or two ago.
Rulers of the P. o. in ’44, Mary Betty
Stcngel and Janet Baxter, promised
to join “old home week"——not even
teaching in Kerhonkson can keep
old Staters away.

Wandering to and from from the

lower hall of Draper to the Commons,
We see Sgt. George Kunz from the
Class of ’43. He’ll be here to repre-
sent his class, as will Betty Bailey
and Ruth Dee Newton.

If your eyes should go searching
and see a pair of brown, horn rim-
med glasses, that may be Helen
Brucker behind them. It won't be
exactly a surprise to have some of
the home-comers back, but it will be
super to say "‘hello" again to Kit
Herdman Wilson and Ozzie Serabian,
'44. candidates for last fall's Campus
Queen title.

We’re hoping and expecting the
arrival of more personages from '44.
June Clark. Mary Domann. Dolly Di
Rubbo, Jane Southwick Hansen.
Elaine Grogan Leahy, Virginia Mos-
chak and Janet Smith plan to be
here to represent the grand old
Seniors of last year. Perhaps—don't
let your hopes soar too high, sister
females—we may even have present
a few of State’s men from '44. If the
Law of Probability is on the up and
up, Herb Brock. Fred Shoemaker,
and Regis Hammond will be back.

Campus Day. from all appearances.
is fated to be a reunion of State’s
old-timers.
