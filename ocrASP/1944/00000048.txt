Nothing ever happens. Time passes
but each succeeding day brings only
another vary similar one. The recent
reprieve was welcome. In fact, we
hereby take our stand for bigger and
bettr convocations. But, it was a
letdown to come back to find every-
thing the same. A quick tour of the
‘ lower hall convinced us that no dras-
tic or far-reaching changes had
taken pace. The signs on the various
bulletin boards hung each one in its
accustomed place. The slightly worn
poster announcing the tennis tourna-
ment still surveys the scene—still
with its last two brackets empty. So
much a part of State has it become
that it gradually fades into the back-
ground. Like the wall, it’s always
there but its presence ceases to be
a matter for comment or notice.

We still cling to our rather naive
belief that the, tennis tournament
can be completed. We admit, how-
ever, that our faith is becoming a
trifle frayed around the edges.

We Take It Back

Perhaps we were a bit hasty in our
previous generalization concerning
the lack of change hereabouts. We
have noted that the water fountain
across from the P. 0., which regularly
dispenses warm water, now does so
with all the efficiency of a geyser.
Naturally, this provides a constant
source of amusement for the inmates
of the P. 0. What an opportunity for
some enterprising soul with the
necessary capital to open a soap
concession.

Voting Proceedure

It has been rumored around that
WAA’s constitution is about to un-
dergo considerable revision. The
changes are designed to make
nomination of candidates to office
a more democratic proceedure—
one in which there will be more
direct participation of the organ-
ization as a whole. In the present
set-up, the senior council of WAA
meets at some specified time in
the spring. When the door to the
inner sanctum opens again the list
of candidates is prepared. Thus
some four or five people have
arbitrarily decided what names
shall be put up for the rest of the
200 or so voting members of WAA
to choose from. Even if everything
were done in a strictly legal man-
ner. such a system is bound to
arouse suspicion. And there seems
to be evidence that at times these
suspicions have been justified.
0n the other hand

In the case for

 

WAA, there is

the fact that qualifications for
office are strict. For example. to
be eligible for president, a girl

must have credit in four sports a
year for the past three years.
Usually there are only three or
four girls who have been faithful
enough to athletics to be eligible.
It could be argued that the Senior
council know who among these
girls are best suited for offices.
This argument breaks down how-
ever when we consider that the
“masses” of WAA know these girls
and their capabilities too.

If and when WAA does revise
its constitution. we will regard it
as a step in the right direction——
the direction of fair play and good
spirit which an organization suoh
as WAA should seek to foster.

Two Weeks ago an underrated
and under-dog State team fought
its way out of a 6-0 hole to clip
Albany Medical School, 19-18.
Playing on Page Hall Field, the
Med School pulled one of the
prettiest plays in football on the
opening kick-off. Goldblatt took
the ball on his own five-yard line
and with beautiful blocking by
useppens‘head and Poiirafkee he
tore up the left side-line all the
way for a touchdown. Marshall
attempted a run around right end
for the extra point, but he was
tagged before he reached the line
of scrimmage.

The State team quickly drove for
a score. Pike did some fine run-
ning in this drive and culminated
it by scoring from the Med twelve.
The score at the end of the first
quarter was 6-6.

The second quarter found State
turning on the heat. In quick suc-
cession they pushed over two
touchdowns and one extra-point.
The first was due to the efforts of
“Sparky” Vaughn who ran the ball
from the Med 40-yard line to the
10 and then took it over on a
straight line buck. Sullivan’s pass
for the State’s last score came aft-
er a Med fumble was recovered and
Bob Heinan took the ball down the
field on a. series of brilliant runs.
Bob Sullivan passed to Bert Pike to
put the ball on the Med two-yard
line where Heinan took it over for
the score. This time Sullivan’s
pass was good, and the score stood
at 19-6.

After the kick-off Goldblatt pass-
ed to Marshall on the State five
and Kessler took it over for the
score. The try for conversion fail-
ed. The half ended 19-12.

The second half consisted mostly
of defensive play which was inter-
rupted only when Med scored its
last six points. Goldblatt was again
the hero by running 40 yards to
pay-dirt. The crucial try for point
was stopped and the clock ran out
with State winning 19-18.

The following Sunday, State
played its second game with Siena
College. The results of this battle
were much different than the first.
It was a wild and wooly affair all
the way. The conflict was started
by Siena kicking the pigskin into
the arms of the mighty Bob Sulli-
van on State’s 35-yard line. The
ball was halted on the 45, for a
gain of 10 yards for State was held
for four downs giving Siena poss-
ession of the ball.
down Tracy received the ball and

reversed to Gaffney, who ran
around right end for the first
score. Gaffney failed to convert.

Weber received the kick and travel-
ed to Siena's 43, where he was
knocked out of bounds. On an
intercepted pass Siena again came
in the lime light. when they streak-
ed up the field to State’s 20. By
another interception Pike. of State,
trotted freely up the field for their
first touchdown. and took the lead
when Sullivan made the extra point.

Lehman. of State. began the ac-
tion in the third session. vhon he
recovered a fumble in the oppon-
ent's end zone, giving State the up-
per hand. Sicna raised the score
2 points by driving State back for
a safety.

Tracy gave Siena the edge when
he took a reverse around left end
for a score. This finished the
scoring for the rivals. With a
spectacular crash through the line.

Fresh Feeling Frustrated

Come Thursday, the Rivalry
classes will once again be set
free to wreak vengeance upon
each other with all the malice
aforethcught at their command.
In other words. the freshmen
and sophomores will have an-
other banner hunt. Myskania
will hide the irosh banner and
both classes will look for it. All
this activity takes place between
the hours of 'l .and 9:30, making
it the first time since 1941 that
a banner hunt will be held at
night. Dimout regulations since
then have made daylight hunts
the rule.

As a result of the Campus
Day hunt, ’47 managed to keep
its banner inviolate. The frosh
sandard was discovered but in
the words of B. J. Bittner, soph
president, “To remove it from
its hiding place on the stage
would have meant only un-
necessary less of life and dam-
age to stage property.”

 

 

 

WAA Invites
'48 to Reception

Next Thursday, WAA plans to
hold :1 Reception Tea for the class
of ’40. This will be the first social
event of the season. The Tea will
be held in the Lounge between 3:30
PM. and 5 PM

All women who have paid their
Student Tax automatically become
members of WAA and are invited
to attend. It will also be an ex-
cellent chance for any freshmen
women who are interested in WAA,
to meet the members of WAA
Council and ask any questions they
may have concerning the sports
program which has been planned
for the season.

Faculty members have been in-
vited to attend and entertainment
will be provided by WAA members.
Peg Bostwick, in charge of the
entertainment plans to present a
fencing bout, in which members of
last year’s fencing team will par-
ticipate.

Edna Sweeney, ’47, has been ap-
pointed General Chairman of the
Tea.

The following committees have
been appointed to assist her: Ar—
rangements, Phyllis Carpenter and
Jean Griffin; Faculty Invitations,
Ann Masti'angalo; Refreshments,
Betty Rose Hilt and Betty Jane
Bittner; Clean-up. Jean Davidson
and Bertha Wakin. ,

As Stale .lills Hike, Chose Bulls

“The whistle blew then
. The train. drew nigh.

We all hopped on,

And said good-bye.”

When eight State girls go to
Camp Johnston, things start apop-
pin’ and the bulls start alookin’.
Excitingf—and howl That is if
ferocious, friendly, bulls can be
called exciting.

The fun didn't start until Betty
Margot with her confederates Doris
Doran, Virginia Effley, Gloria Pi-
rowski, Gloria Russo, Barbara Reiff
Mary Telian, and Bobby Van
Auken limped off the train at .a
friendly little town called Chat-
ham. From there began a mile
hike to the camp.

“From the station

To Camp Johnston,

Is a hike to tire the feet.

But in our case—Dear Readers

The wooriness was in the seat.”

P.S. They took a. Taxi.

It was a beautiful sight to see
Camp Johnston perched serenely
on top of a hill in the wide open
farm country—serenely that is un-
ti —

“Cleaning began,

The dust flew free.

It grow so thick,
We couldn’t see.”

What really dismayed the girls
and accounted for fatigue duty was
cleaning the camp. After all Thurs-
day to Sunday was a long time and
that was just necessity.

Spirit is wonderful, but there is
nothing like some clear, icy cold
creek water to dampen the best of
it. The girls went camping and
they did it in the rough. Seems
teachers education doesn’t prepare
one to be a plumber——what is there
to be done when the pump won't
work?——Use creek water of course.
That wasn’t too bad until three girls
fell in.

It rained for a while. so the girls
sang. A few hikes were scheduled—
and WAA members once again en-
joyed themselves.

“The dishes were finished,

A hike was started.

Over the creek—

Pirowski was carted.

The wafer was high,

Her seat was low,

How she got so wet—

We wouldn’t know."

In short—

Wc sure had fun

And we’re telling you.

You will too!

War Activities Councill has an-

council composed of one member
to be elected from each group
house. It will be a much larger
group than the main council which
has only two representatives from

meet separately and is designed to

create greater interest in War

houses.

The Council is planning an ex-
tensive publicity campaign for the
Blood Bank. Approximately 50
students have already signed up to
donate their blood on Nov. 10, and
11 more will donate on Nov. 17.
Those students who are going to

give blood may be excused from

The council has also slated an

Paradox Shown,-
Eligible Voters

Elect Roosevelt
Forum Will Hold Rally

In Commons Tuesday

Governor Thomas E. Dewey was
elected as first choice candidate for
Presxdcnt by the student body. In
the straw vote conducted by the
S'l‘A'l‘l-l COLLEGE News last week. Stu-
dent Association gave Dewey a
margin of 1.0% over President
Roosevelt. However, 56.8% of the
student eligible to vote in the
national elections are in favor of
Roosevelt for the next president of
the United States. Only 78.9% of
the student body voted in the straw
vote. 10.3% of whom are eligible to
vote.

This election was a close race,
with Dewey polling 25 more votes
than the President. The actual
figures were: Dewey. 405; Roosevelt,
380; Thomas. 3; disqualified. 2; and
blanks, 3. The total number of votes
cast was 793.

Republican Traditionally

The vote this year is in keepino
with the tradition that State Col-
lege is Republican in its politics.
Only one in the twenty years that
polls have been conducted at State
has a Democratic candidate for
President been elected by the stu-
dent body. Of the five times that
Roosevelt has been voted upon at
the college he was favored by the
student body only once.

In 1928, the college chose the Re-
publican Albert Ottinger 2—1 over
Franklin D. Roosevelt for governor
of New York. Roosevelt won the
State election, however. The student
voters gave Herbert Hoover a 2-1
majority over Roosevelt in 1932, but
Roosevelt came through in the
elections with a landslide vote.
Democrat Selected

Student Association guessed cor-
rectly in 1936 when they polled
Roosevelt a 14 vote majority over
the Republican candidate Landon.
It was noticeable. however, that al-
though Roosevelt won by a meager
majority in the college elections,
he won by an unprecendentedly
large one in the nationals.

State swung back to the Repub-
lican side again in 1940 when the
straw vote favored Willkie by a 17
vote majority. This year's elections
remained Republican when the stu-
dents gave Dewey u 25 vote edge on
Roosevelt.

It is evident that elections at
State have very little bearing on
the national elections and that the
results of this ballot would fore-
cast a victory for Roosevelt since
the polls in the previous years have
almost invariably acted as negative
indicators.

Forum will sponsor an election
rally Tuesday evening from 8 to 11
P. M. in the Commons. The pur-
pose of the rally is to promote na-
tional emphasis.

During the evening. there will be
stump speeches for each of the
candidates by members of Forum.
James Crandall. ’40, will give one
of the speeches in favor of Roose-
velt and Anita Leone and Dolores
Ropkca, Seniors, will present argu-
ments in favor of Dewey.

Throughout the rally, there will
be portable radios and a loud
speaker system so that students
may hear the results as they are
broadcast.

The program will also consist of
dancing and cards, but the via will
be shut off whenever a report
comes through so that everyone
can hear it.
