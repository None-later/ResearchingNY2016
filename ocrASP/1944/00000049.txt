 Platform

In these times of political campaigns and plat-
form we cf the STATE COLLEGE N aws Board would
like to present our platform for the year 1944-1945.
This platform is in theform of a resolution to the
Student Association of State College as follows:

WHEREAS:

We of the STATE COLLEGE NEws Board
believe in the fundamental principles of
democracy and the'freedoms expressed in
the Bill of Rights, i. e. freedom of speech
and freedom of press;

And whereas we believe that a group
whether majority or minority has the right
of freedom of expression and that suppres-
sion of these rights is alien to those ideals
for which we are fighting;

Therefore be it resolved:

That the STATE COLLEGE News Board, as
long as it is serving the Student Associa-
tion, shall do so impartially and in accord-

’ ance with the above principles and shall

not be influenced by any group, majority
or minority, student or otherwise.

The STATE COLLEGE NEWS has been one of the
most democratic organizations on the college
campus. This has been partly due to the freedom
of expression allowed by the administration to the
students. There has been no faculty supervison, a
feature which is unique among state colleges. The
NEWS has been proud to live up to the faith of the
administration and has never wilfully violated the
trust of the administration or failed in its obligation
to the student body. in times when it has been
impossible to reconcile its dual obligation, the News
has followed its conception of the principles govern-
ing a student organ which represents the best in-
terests of the student body. It has endeavored to
reflect student opinion, whether it has been of a

‘minority contrary to prevailing interests, or those of

a majority group.

We realize that this is idealistic. We do not feel
however that these ideals are “juvenile” but that
they are the ideals which reflect the highest form
of “freedom of the press” and the rights incor-
porated in the Constitution.

In operation, these principles may become dis-
torted or misinterpreted. However, the newspaper
fails in its moral obligation if it allows these devia-
tions to turn it from its principles. It can only
attempt to reflect all sides of all questions, to bring
the burning issues of the day to the attention of the
public and let them decide for themselves.

These are the ideals of the press as we interpret
them. This is our obligation as we see it. To sub-
ugat these principles would be to forfeit our
integrity.

The Case Rests—Or

 

In the October 27th issue of the
STATE COLLEGE News there appeared
an article, “The Case Rests" by
Sunna Cooper.

Now far be it from us to under-
take to defend Governor Dewey, be-
cause it is generally agreed by now
that the Governor can v;ry well
take care of himself. But let us take
a look at these “official facts.” We
are told that the reader will not
read on when he sees the Republican
campaign called a campaign of
falsehoods. Well, it seems that the
words “misrepresentation and falsi-
fication" were used by the New Deal
candidate in his first speech “in the
usual political sense” at the Team-
sters’ Union dinner.

It is very easy to make the state-
ment that Gov. Dewey is evasive
about his foreign policy, but that
doesn’t make it true. Surely Gov.
Dewey hasn’t been evasive about
Dumbarton Oaks. He hasn't been
evasive about joining a world organ-
ization, backed by force to keep the
peace. Nor has he been evasive
about our representative to that
body.

But what really brings tears to
our eyes is the concern of the New
Deal candidate for the soldier. both
regarding his welfare upon return-
ing borne. and his right to vote. As
of October 28. 1944, New York State
with its Stu/c ballot has received
368,030 voted War Ballots, or 61%.
New Jersey with its Federal ballot.
has received 31%. Which works the
better? Now how does the New Deal
candidate feel toward the returned
soldier when he isn't running for
office? Well. you asked for it w
here it is!

ON. 1.9.1.1: President Roosevelt
tnot running for office now» before
the American Legion Convention
declared: "No person, because he
wore a uniform, must. thereafter be
placed in a special class of benefi—
ciaries over and above all other
citizens. The fact of wearing a uni—
form does not mean that he can
demand and receive from his gov~
cl'nmont a benefit no other citizen
receivrd." 'l‘hroughout his three
terms in the White House. 11':
years, Mr. ltotmovelt. has adhered to
this hard-boiled, unsympathetic
policy in dealing with the Vt‘lt't'llllli
and their problems.

The Roosevelt Record
in the guise of government econo—

uly, although there was no ecollomy

in the New Ht'tti (lovernnu-nt, he
sent to Congress the so~euiivd lileon—
omy 11111 which was passed by Con—
gross and signed by him on March

20, 1933. Those Were some of the

results:

1. War-tune service-connected dis-
abilities ware reduced 20%. t'l‘hc

cut from $100 a month to $80. The

disability was cut from $50 a
month to $40 a month.)

2. 55,000 combat casualty cases were
abolished.

3. Civil War veterans and widows
(benefits) were reduced 10%.

4. $460,000,000 was taken from the
veterans of all wars.

5. Allowances to 145,848 veterans
were discontinued and the balance
reduced 10%.

Some of the Reasons

Why We Need A Change

Promises against performances:

1. Mr. Roosevelt said, "I still know
that the fate of America cannot
depend on any one man. The
greatness of America is grounded
in principles and not on any single
personality. I, for one. shall re-
member that, even as President."
This was said in 1932 when he was
running for office.

2. Mr. Roosevelt said. "With refer-
ence to the Federal Government’s
guaranteeing deposits in all Na-
tional banks. I believe that such
action would be quite impossible.
It would lead to laxity in bank
management and carelessness on
the part of both banker and de-
positor. I believe that it would be
an impossible drain on the Federal
Treasury to make good any such
guarantee. For a number of rea-
sons of sound government. finance,
such a plan would be quite dan-
gerous.” He said that in 1932 when
he was first a candidate for Pros-
ident. and when Republican Sena-
tor Vandcnberg of Michigan was
advocating Federal guarantee of
bank deposits. The New Deal now
claims credit. for Federal Deposit
Insurance.

And Who Was An Isolationist?

Let‘s look at. the record. On De-
cember 28. 1933. President Roosevelt
said of the League of Nations, “We
are not members. and we do not,
contemplate membership."

On January 3, 1034. he said “I
havr made it clear that the United
States cannot take part in political
.u'rangenu-nts in it‘lll'tipe."

(in October 25, 1935, he said,
“Despite wind happens to continents
overseas, the United States of Amor—
icn shall and must remain unen-
tungied and free."

STATE COLLEGE NEWS, FRIDAY, NOVEMBER 3, 1944

GW—

Dear Editor:

Last Friday morning we had a
guest speaker invited to our college
by one of our college organizations.
During Mr. Wiswall’s talk there was
a disturbance behind his back
caused by two members of Myskania.
It was a disgraceful performance for
an adult. But what concerns our
student body more is the fact that
these girls were acting in an official
capacity; they represented State
College!

I know that there were many
other members of Student Associa-
tion who felt ashamed for our col-
lege as I did, and we hope this never
occurs again.

Sincerely,
Jean Winyall

Dear Miss Winyall:

Had I been sitting in the audience
last Friday, I would have acted as
“unseemly” as I did on the stage.
If you feel that I, as a Myskania
member, must have a duo personal-
ity I will do my best to develop the
other phase of my character.

Very sincerely,
Jane Rooth
To the Editor:

In last week's News appeared a
two-column feature by Sunna Coo—
per in which she criticized the Re-
publican candidate for President of
the United States.

It has been rumored that because
of this article, various members of
the News Board were highly criti-

cized by the administration—to the

Newman Club Sponsors
Communion Breakfast

The annual Communion Break-
fast, primary fall event in Newman
Club's social calendar, will be held
Sunday at 9:00 AM. in Newman
Hall, 741 Madison Avenue. Reverend
James Pritchard of St. Peter’s Hos-
pital will be the principal speaker.

Preceding the breakfast. all mem-
bers will hear Mass at 8:15 AM. in
the Grotto of Our Lady of Lourdes.

B. J. McGrath, chairman of the
affair, is assisted by the following
committees: Food, Priscilla Hayes,

Any members who wish to attend
the Breakfast should sign on the

3:30 PM. this afternoon. The price
is fifty cents.

extent of a “Cease and Desist” order
on further articles of this type.
Platnly put~we here at State Col-
lege must sacrifice one of the cardi-
nal principles of the Bill of Rights—-
the right of FREE SPEECH—so.
that we might insure the post war
plans for State College.

Does this mean that teachers
training in a State institution must
forget that Tarawa, Salerno. Guam,
etc. were ever fought, and why these
battles were fought.

The Atlantic Charter is an empty
collection of fine diction as far as
State College is concerned, for if we
speak our minds on political issues,
we are committing an offense and
therefore must expect retribution of
the narrowest, bigoted variety.

Can we stand up to the ideals for
which 11,000,000 of our men are
fighting? Students of State College,
the issue is clear——are we or are
we not to have our constitutional
right of free speech!

Yours for Democracy,
Jim Crandell

 

Dear Miss Winyall,

I do not feel called upon to ex-
cuse my actions as an individual
since I do not feel that they were
disgraceful. However, if you and
any other member of the student
body feel that I, .as a member of
Myskania, garbed in a robe. have
no right to be a person or an in-
dividual, then indeed I do OWe you
an apology.

Sincerely,
Edna Marsh.

STILLWELL CALLED HOME

General Stillwell's recall from
China as Chiang’s chief of staff.
has been attributed by the Presi-
dent to a request by the Generalis-
simo. It would be disastrous if
this prejudiced Americans against
China. The unhappy story or
China. at revolution and fighting
an outside war has been known to
many insiders for more than a
year. Inflation, corruption, Army
inefficiency and the party conflict
between Kunmintang reactionaries
and democrats, added to minors
that arms are being diverted from
Japs to Chinese communists. are
depressing out new news. China
has endured eight heroic war years
of almost tingle effort. She needs
friends more. desperately today
than ever. How America reacts to
StiIIWell’s dismissal, how America
responds to China’s desperation, are
matters not of sentiment but of
self-interest. China today holds
the one hope for a democratic Asia.

Meanwhile, the Japanese are
pressing harder about Kweilin.

HITLER’S MISTAKE?

In Roetgen, 15 miles south of
captured Aachen, townspeople told
the American victors that Hitler is
to blame for losing the war. His
greatest mistake, they add, was his
persecution of the Jews. When
asked why, five condemned the
policy on moral grounds; the great
majority said the Jews were “too
powerful and internationally influ-
ential a nation.”

This comes as tragic irony com-
pared with Nazl Europe’s murder
of some 8 million Jews—whom no

. force was able to rescue.

visor of Languages in the Milne

From 1939 until last February,

on his Ph.D., Mr. Allard was a facul-
ty member of Milne.

When the office was deactivated
because of the progress of the war

ington to be interviewed by the War
Department, but accepted the offer
to work in the Consulate Service
under Secretary of State.
