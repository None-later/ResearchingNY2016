Question of the week:

Why is it that whenever there is
a dance in the gym the floor is so
highly waxed that no one can dance
on it? Or could it be that some
economical soul is trying to prevent
wear and tear on the boards.
Great News

Enough to warm the heart of any
Sports editor is the new that State
will have varsity basketball this
year. The plan is somewhat hazy at
present but Art Kaufman, MAA
director, says that two games have
already been scheduled. That’s
enough for confirmed optomists like
us to go on.

A few reminiscences are undoubt-
edly in order. We could go on at
great length about the teams of old.
But let's not. The “good old days”
were good. We wish they were back.
But we should not minimize what
we have now in the light of those
memories. It is worse than futile—-
it is unfair—to compare anything
today to the same thing three or
four years ago. Our men will be out

there this season with the same
spirit that motivated a Hansen. a
Dickson,‘a Brauner. Just as those
boys deserved our support and ad-
miration. so do our boys in ’44.

In a certain sense, we owe them a
great deal more of the aforemen-
tioned credit. A few years ago the
organization of varsity sports was
well set up. It ran smoothly. The
individual player had no responsi-
bility other than practice and play-
ing in games. Now however. the
picture is different. There is no
provision made for varsity. These
fellows have taken the initiative.
The league is their brain-child. It
is something for which they are
willing to work and make sacrifices.
Money, Money

In view of their expanding pro-
gram it is necessary that MAA have
a further appropriation. Fifty dol-
lars does not go too far when it
must be spread over a year’s activi-
ties. It is our humble opinion that
any money given to this purpose will
be money well spent. As We have
said many times before, sports are
good for a college—good for the
spirit they arouse. the sense of pride
they give the publicity they afford.
Excitement?

As a follow-up to our gripe of last
week about nothing ever happening
—-with special reference to the ten-
nis tournament—we would like to
report that something did. No, the
tourney isn't finished. But there is
only one more match to be played.
A vague suspicion is gradually forc-
ing its way into our tired minds——
a suspicion that once more the WAA
tennis tournament will be relegated
to the realm of unfinished business.
If we had not spent so much space
and printer's ink in airing our views
on the affair, we would most cer-
tainly do so now.

HATS OFF TO MAA

The wonder of the year is the
remarkable activity of MAA. When
we compare the two athletic or-
ganizations as to budget. equip—
ment. material and achievements.
we find MAA fur outwclghlng its
female counterpart in achievements
while trailing them badly on the
other three counts. We hate to
point out the obvious—but some—

thing is wrong with H system which
works out like that.

At any rate. orchids go to MAA
for doing so mllch with the little
they have. State owes the men
thanks and continued support.

Al Slale Again,-
Prclclice Slorls

By George Hess

 

“All good things come to those
who get out and do something
about them.” This might have
been the guiding light in the re-
birth of varsity basketball at State
College. When the year started no
one thought much about basketball.
It was just another war casualty,
lamented but accepted. To some
people, notably Jack Hathaway,
Milne High coach. and Art Kauf-
man, MAA director, it would not be
impossible to form a team. They
were supported by the men in the
school who were ready, willing and
able to play.

Support From Above

At first everything was nebulos
and hazy. Informal practice was
the rule. Fellows grabbed minutes
from between classes and lunch
periods to get in a few shots at the
hoop. A few of the boys that are
on the inside were informed and
told to sign up. The list kept
growing, the boys kept working
and finally it broke. Coach Hath-
away and Kaulfman approached
Dr. Sayles with the proposition.
There was no bickering or hedging.
Dr. Sayles was all in favor of it
and even promised his support in
getting the team uniforms. Thus
the idea has the OK. of the ad-
ministration.

With such backing as they have
received so far the boys are off on
the right foot. but there is still
lunch to be done. There is the
problem of games. A school can
have a wonderful team and no one
to play against. There are several
things that must be taken into
consideration here and the fore-
most is the lack of funds at MAA's
disposal. The total appropriation
for MAA was only $185.. and $100.
of this is set aside for post-war
sports. If we are to get games with
other schools we must have money
for transportation. No games are
being considered with other than
teams relatively close to us. But
the item of transporting ten or
twelve fellows to. for example. Cort-
land would run quite high. This
must be met by additional appro-
priation or by some other method.
Sounds Good, Hub?

The games themselves will have
to be with teams of caliber close to
ours. In other words. we can‘t
expect to be playing teams like
L.I.U.. Canisius. St. John's. Seton
Hall or the North Texas Aggies.
Colleges like Cortland. Hartwick,
A.B.C.. Oneonta. and even. per-
haps. R.P.I. would be closer to our
level and still closer to home. These
schools are not too large and pre—
sumably have open dates still left
in their schedules. The ideal ar-
rangement now seems to be a se-
ries of home-and-lmme games with
the teams that We have mentioned.
With a set-up like this no guar-
antee has to be furnished. again
cutting down tentative 'outlay. A
home-and-holne series also gives
cithcr team a chance for revenge.
which builds up interest in the
games.
ll‘irst Practice

The first practice is set for Mon-
day.Novcmbcr l‘. and all the boys
have invitations to come. This is
not a clOscd practice and the girls
can come and watch. if they want
to.

Myskania has announced the
Rivalry sports events for the
next two weeks.

The winners of tournaments
in each of the Rivalry classes
will meet in a ping pong match
this afternoon at 4:00 in the
Commons. 1“; points will be
awarded to the winner of two

WAA Bulletin

The WAA full program has been
expanded to include roller-skating.
The first session for the devotees
of the silver wheels takes place to-
morrow night at Hoffman’s roller-
skating rink.

There is only one match left to
be played in the tennis tourney.
But due to a hand injury of one of

Owls Face Bier—la—
In Final Game

The Owls of State College will
close a successful G-man touch-
tackle football season when they
pit their strength against Sicna
College on Bcverwyck gridiron
Sunday.

Decisive Game

This battle will decide the win-
llcr in the 3-gamc series. Sicna
took the first game 19-13 and State
came back to trample Siena in the
second tilt 31-14.

The Owls will go into this all-
important contest the underdog due
to the loss this week of Bert Pike.
Pike was a backfield sparkplug
throughout the entire season and
more than once drove State to
tally.

With Sullivan. Lehman and Pike.
State boasted a better than average
backfield that with a stalwart line
gave State a fine club. The ball
playing of Weber and Vaughn on
the line was especially commend-
able.

Siena will meet State with the
same team that has faced them
the past two tilts. Marcelle will
again spark the Sienacans and
Malone. a scrappy little end, will
have to be watched.

Whether State comes out of this
session a winner or not. the team
has accomplished near miracles
with the material on hand.

Good Average

The lncn of State will at least
boast a .500 average and possibly
better when they ring down the
curtain on the abbreviated ’44 sea-
son.

 

‘7/V‘7’4 a] W144

This week We have chosen Mary
Sanderson, ’45. Vice President of
WAA. as our outstanding WAA per-
sonality. Sandy’s athletic career at
State College has been an all-
round one based on plenty of high

school experience. She took an
active part in the usual athletics
which were offered in her high
schoolwand then some! Sandy was
the Student Manager of the Intra—
mural program and participated in
Varsity basketball until it was dis-
continued. We also learned that
Sandy had energy to spare in high
school but as a pacer for the high
school track team, she soon found
an outlet for this surplus.

’45 Mainstay

At State College, Sandy joined
the athletic ranks of the Crimson
Tide and her steady prowess con-
tributed much to the rivalry con-
tests which brought her class to
final victory over the Blue Devils.
Her name appears among those of
the Sophs who were prominent in
rivalry basketball, hockey, softball,
and obstacle races. During this
same year Sandy was chosen to
represent the Kappa Deltas on the
All-Star basketball team.

The basketball court proved to
be the place where our star's abil-
ity really came to the fore. In her
junior year. she was captain of
basketball and sparkpluggcd the
defense on the powerful KD team.
Girl‘s basketball began to get too
tame for Sandy and We found her
among the other venturesomc in—
:lividuals who challenged the State
men to a basketball contest. It is
the general opinion that Sandy is
one of the “fightenest” women on
the basketball court. Just to see
her in action proves this. It was
Sandy who coached the frosh to
victory in their court tilt against
the Blue Devils. Not only has she
acted as a coach but she has also
refereed many of tho intro-mural
games.

Not Only Basketball

Sandy has not limited hcr sports
career to basketball alone. The
softball diamond also has a similar
charm for this demon of all sports.
As a fielder she is unbeatable and
her hard hitting can not be over-
looked.

Besides these two sports. Sandy
participates in almost every other
sport—even a weekend jaunt to
Camp Johnston!

However. WAA is not all pure.
unadulterated fun for Sandy. Her
indefatigable efforts on WAA
Council go toward helping to pro-
vide State women with itll adequate
sport program.

From all observations. we feel
safe in predictingr that Sandy's
athletic career will go on after she
leaves State for wasn't Dick Beach
one of the outstanding athletes in
the Class of ‘45?

WAR COUNCIL OPENS '44-’45 DRIVE

 

Moody Heads
Campus Chest
In Annual Drive

The annual Campus Chest drive
sponsored by Student Association
begins today after assembly. and
will continue until November 20.
Eileen Moody, ’46. Chairman. an-
nounced that the goal is $1 per
person.

Each student will be contacted
through representatives from their
own group houses. There are also
committees to contact communters
and extra-curricular organizations
for their contributions to the fund.

Miss Moody wishes to remind the
students that the fund will be
divided among the World Student
Service Fund. Red Cross, and In-
fantile Paralysis Drive. The part
which each organization receives
will be small even if everyone gives
the amount solicited.

Goals Unattained

Last year the requested contribu-
tion was $.50 per person. but the
committee feels that there are a
number of students who would give
$1. and feel proud to be able to help.
Seven houses on campus last year
contributed 100%. and this year it
is believed that more people will give
more money. so that all the houses
can be “100 houses." This year's
large enrollment also foretells larger
returns.

Upperclassmen will recall that for
the past two years, the drive has
fallen short of its goal. In ’43. the
goal of $500 was missed by $175.
and in '44. by $67. For this reason,
no goal, other than $1 per person
has been set. The chairman hopes
that this year's drive will top last
year's. and also set a figure to aim
at in next year’s drive.

Campus Chest Committees

The following are the committees
appointed for the drive: publicity.
Betty Rose Diamond. ’46; faculty.
Georgette Dunn, ’46: comlnuters.
Pulricia Feellnn. ’46; organizations.
Dorothy Knapp. '47; extra activities.
Mary Straub and Marianne Davis,

Slaie Goes Soulh American

In "Newspaper Exchange”

South Of The Border. down the
University of Santo Domingo way
has come to State College a few
copies of their University paper,
“El UniverSitario," as part of a
“Good Neighbor Plan.”

Eduardo Jimenez Martinez.
“Director-Fundador" of the paper
has requested that we distribute
the copies among student bodies
and organizations which might
wish to establish connection with
his University.

“El Universitario,” written en-
tirely in Spanish, is a 20 page
tabloid containing articles, stories.
photographs and poems. On page
one is a message from the Uni-
versity students of the Dominican
Republic to the University stu-
dents of North America. The
Americas’ principles furthering
the “Good Neighbor Policy" is
the main object of this story.

State will reciprocate by send-
ing back several copies of the
S'rilrn COLLEGE News to, as Mr.
Martinez expressed it, “come to
a closer understanding and esti-
mate amongst the groups of
students in this country and
yours."

Fcldmalln, Cooper
To Speak Today

Campus Chest Drive will be of-
ficially opened today by Miss Alex-
andria Feldmahn, secretary of the
World Student Service Fund. who
will speak in assembly. Sunna Coo-
per, '45, will enlighten the student
body on war activities for the col-
lege year.

Miss Feldmahn, who opened last
year's Campus Chest Drive, came
from Russia three years ago. She
matriculated at Pembroke College.
entering as a Junior. Graduating in
1943. she received the Student Gov-
ernment Association award for the
lnost outstanding contribution to the
life of the college. Miss Feldmahn’s
experience as a European student
during the maelstrom of war aids
her in discussing student problems
in time of war.

The World Student Service Fund
says of their secretary. “Her fine.
strong and unselfish sense of value.
her organizaiion and her experience
and gift as a speaker fit her ex-
ceptionally well to interpret to
American students the causc of
World Student Relief."

Ellccn Moody. ‘46. head of this
year’s drivc. states that the purpose
of the drive is to collect funds from
the student body and to distributc the
proceeds among the various chur-
iil‘lbll' organizations according to
the wishes of lllc student body. The

Seniors Selected
In Poll Direcled
By Press Bureau

From a wide variety of nominees,
six Senior women were elected by
Student Association in a poll con-
ducted by Press Bureau in last
week's assembly to represent State
in Who‘s Who Among Student’s in
American universities and colleges.

Florence Garfall was selected
most popular by a marked majority
in the first distribution. Queen
Mary Now was nominated most
beautiful by a 66-vote majority over
Dorothea Smith on the second dis—
tribution. The choice for most ver-
satile was a close race with Edna
Marsh winning by '7 votes over Joan
Smith on the third distribution.
Sunna Cooper gained a majority
over Eleanor Hayeslip on the second
distribution to be chosen as the one
who has done most for State. In
landslide votes and both in the
second distribution, Lucille Kenny
was voted most dramatic and Mary
Sanderson selected as most athletic.
Nominees Considered

’l‘hcsc nominees have been sent
in Who‘s Who Among Slmlcnls for
consideration by the board. If the
board agrees to accept the nomina-
tions for representatives from State.
each of the nominees will be noti—
fied and sent a form to fill out
concerning her activities. They are
not. however. obligated in any way
to purchase the publication. but
illcy may do so if they wish.

State To Register

In Draper Today
And Next Week

International Student Day
Will Be Celebrated

War Activities Council today of-
ficially launches its program for the
year in an effort to stimulate 100%
student support and participation in
the war effort. In an attempt to
counteract apathy among the stu-
dent body, there will be registration
at a table in the lower hall of
Draper all day today as well as
Monday and Tuesday where students
may sign up for the various phases
of war work.

In addition to registration. today
and next Friday are official State
College Blood Bank days and those
students who signed up will donate

_ their blood between 11 A. M. and

2:30 P. M. For both these days only
72 out of approximately 1000 stu-
dents, or 7% of the student body,
have signed up to give blood. The

Old Clothes Drive

On Monday an extensive Old
Clothes Drive for Russian War Re-
lief will begin under the supervision
of Sunna Cooper. '45. Mary Bess
Vernoy, '46, and Shirley Gross, ’47,
will be co-chairmen assisting her.

urged to contribute any old cloth-
ing that is still wearable but of no
use to them. A box for this pur-
pose will be placed in front of the
Stamp Booth in Draper Hall and
representatives to War Activities

group house. A similar drive con-
ducted two years ago yielded 2000
pounds of clothes and that figure
has been set as the goal for this
year’s drive. The Russian War
Relief agency in Albany has sent
out an appeal for volunteers to
pack the clothing already contri—
buted that is at headquarters. Ac-

needed desperately and without
volunteers for packing they cannot
be sent overseas."
