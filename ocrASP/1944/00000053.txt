TROUBLE-SHOOTER

Donald Nelson's assignment to
create'a Chinese WPB suggests that
America has finally decided which
horse to back in Asia—particularly
postwar Asia. Elements in the
multi-faceted Kuomintang and Am-
erican industry were known to
carry a secret torch for Japan. We
now seem headed for concrete co-
operation with China. The Stilwell
episode is temporarily shelved. and
peace feelers may yet heal the es-
tranged Communists and Kuoming-
tang. Meanwhile, the Japs are
menacing Liuchow, having taken
Kweilin. Threatened is an Ameri-
can B-29 bomber base. one of the
few we still control in China.
NEAR METZ

The American Third Army is
hurling back powerful German
counter-attacks in its drive to en-
circle Metz. The British Second
Army also advanced in its sector
south of the Noorden Canal in the
Netherlands.

LEY’I‘E RESISTANCE

Vague reports from the Philip-
pines say American troops on Leyte
have “practically severed" the Or-
moc road in a movement to cut off
enemy units near Limon, Ameri-
can-held village. There have been
hints but no further statistics on
losses in that area. Japanese re-
sistance is unabated.

BUSINESS vs. WAR AIMS

Testifying to the insulation of
world businessmen against the re»
allties of global war. the Interna—
tional Business Conference at Rye.
N, Y.. has bogglch along into a maze
of deadlock. This is not news for
a conference conducted by repre-
sentatives of private industry and
cartels in 51 nations. and predict—
ed on the Gimme standard: Spokes-
man for Britain dcclalms, "Gimme
preferential treatment." America's
chairman responds. "Gimme tar-
iffs." Cartel makers whisper loud-
ly. "Gimme America. Gimme
France." And the Soviet delegation
continues to "observe."

Contrast this performance with
the Kllgore report this week to the
Senate committee. on military af-
fairs. Charging bluntly that Ger-
man imperialists are already “do-
ploying their economic reserves
throughout the world in prepara-
tion for a third attempt at world
domination." the report urged
smashing the cartels (a type of
internatlmutl monopoly), secret
treaties and other trade barriers.
It urges dismantling of Germany's
war industry and [mnlshmcnt of
its economic leaders; and the es-
tablishing of free trade and exten-
sive reciprocal treaties for all
nations.

Business Week comments, "If our
political insularity has been neu-
tralized, our economic lnsularity
has not been diluted nearly so
much. "Affection for Britain is not

warm and the dislike and fear of
the Russians, though slumbering,
are strong. Farmers are still strong
protectionists, and by no means
the whole of industry believes that
industrialization of foreign coun-
tries will create larger export mar-
kets. “The United States will un-
questionably engender active anta-
gonism abroad if it refused to be—

Who is fighting which "'ar, any-

KIN WE PLAY?

Argentina wants to be friends
again—or so says the Farrell gov-
ernment in a note to Mr. Hull sug—
gesting a Pan-American conference.
The U. 8., who, of course, doesn’t
recognize the pro-Nazi Farrellites,
is on the spot: we either capitulate
to South America’s black sheep and
erstwhile leader, or enforce our
present stand through severe eco-
nomic sanctions. The latter course
could draw frowns from Britain.

LIBERATION IN EUROPE

Three million Jews have been
murdered in Tremblinka death
camp, Poland. Thousands were
killed and mutilated. by wild dogs,
cremation, rap. hanging and shoot-
ing in the death camp near Vught.
Holland. We would like to identify
Allied victory with liberation for
all peoples. This. of course, would
be blinding idealism. Liberation so
far means nothing to anti-Franco
Spaniards, Indians. or above all——
if We consider Europe—to the Jews.

Roumunla proves what Zionist
leaders have foretold: that Allied
conquest alone will not eradicate
the Nazi-sanctified hatred of Je\vs.
Zionists understood that before the
JeWs could regain citizenship. there
must be economic reconstruction;
re-cducuticn. probably by govern—
mental force; and time. With that
incentch, they aided Palestine to
absorb several hundred thousand
refugees. while it also developed it-
self into the single Middle East
arsenal of the Allies.

YOUNG SI'ROll’l‘S

A suite of offices in Washington
is heudqtmrtcrs for AMVE'I‘S,
cableized diminutive for American
Veterans of World War II. The
boys are out to consolidate the
hundred or more groups of War II
vets, bidding frankly against the
American Legion. Some new vets
say they nchr did like the Legion's
swing toward reactionary politics.
Others feel the current vets face
problems distinct from the older
organization.

New Start, Maybe . . .

Today War Activities Council is going overboard
in an effort to get the entire student body to
participate in one of its projects. Their method is
to organize stamp-buying in the college for one day
and through coercion, persuasion or any other ef-
fective method get every student to buy a stamp.
In their project they have the cooperation of
Student Council and Myskania. Though a little
late in starting, such a drive should be indicative of
future War Activities Council plans.

After a false start earlier in the year, War Coun-
cil promises this year to be more prominent. in
student affairs than it has been since the year it
was inaugurated. This is as it should be, with the
country geared to action for the war, the college
should follow Stilt. To date it hasn't and it is
questionable whether or not it will yet. Such
organized drives as the Stamp Day today show that
State College has to be talked to action. Students
were supposed to have signed up for activities
several weeks ago. An extremely small number did
so. This was partly due, undoubtedly to poor
publicity on the part of War Council, but a great
deal of the blame belongs where it has in past
years, with the student body. All this has been
pointed out: before, but fails to make an impression.

War Council has rejuvinated itself, it would be
well if the student body did also.

Men Again

State College is about to witness the first or-
ganized men’s group on campus since the (lis-
solving of the fraternities two years ago. This
group will not exactly take the place of the fraterni-
ties nor will it make the college like “the old days”
when Potter club, SLS, RDR and KB were names
which were synonymous with social life here at
college. We have become a woman’s college for the
duration, the few men we have must organize or
be lost in the enthusiasm of a women‘s administra-
tion of the school‘s extra-class activities. As the
organizer of the new club himself said. “The pur-
pose of this organization is to keep the male mem-
bers of the student body from feeling as if they
were intruders in a harem.“

The long-range purpose of the club at present
seems to be that of a wedge by which the men in
the college may get their our in on the various
activities around school. A dance is planned for
the near future and indefinite plans center around
some activity which will make a contribution to
the war effort here at college. Thus the men of
the college have organized so that they may be
allowed to participate in student affairs. Any or-
ganization this year, with the exception of MAA, is
headed by a woman and the predomimtting member-
ship is mode up of Women. The only way for the
men to make their contribution seems to be through
organization. This is a far cry from the day when
a woman in college (lid well to hold her own in
competition with the men.

Rushees Urged Christmas Packa

To Follow Rules
For Silent Period

Frosh To Receive Bids
For Formal Weekends

Elizabeth Germany, ’45, president
of Intersorority Council has an-
nounced that invitations to sorority
houses for buffet supper and for-
mal dinner will be in the mail
today and in the hands of the
rushees tomorrow.

Silent period formally begins at
12:00 midnight today and lasts
until 5 P.M.. Tuesday, December
5. During this period sorority girls
and freshmen should in no way,
whatsoever. attempt to communi—
cute with each other.

This year the silent period will
include an extra weekend, due to
the fact that in former years invi-
tations were sent out the Monday
before the Thanksgiving recess.
The purpose of silent period is
mainly to give the rushee an op-
portunity to collect her thoughts
in regard to sororities in general
and specific sororities of her parti-
cular preference.

Formal Week-End

The sorority functions include a
buffet supper on December 1, at
which the rushees are entertained
by sorority members from 6 to 9
P. M. Formal dinner, a more aus-
tere occasion. on December 2. will
last from 7 RM. to 11:30 PM.
These functions are usually based
on some theme or motif which is
carried out in the programs and
menus. Sorority women provide
transportation for rushees to and
from formal dinner.

Formal Rush Rules

The Office of the Dean of
Women in conjunction with Inter-
sorority Council desires that the
rushees keep the following rules in
mind:

1. You are receiving invitations
for parties at certain sorority
houses. Check the party you wish
to attend. These are to be re-
turned by mail to the various
sorority houses. If you do not
care to attend any of the parties
given by a sorority. return the
invitation unchecked.

2. From 12 midnight. on Friday,
November 17 until 5 RM. on Tues-
day, December 5, you will not at-
tempt to communicate with sorority
girls. This pertains to traveling
vehicles and places of business also.
The silent period must also be
maintained if the rushees and the
sorority member have residence in
the some community over Thanks-
giving vacation.

Debate Series Planned
By Freshman Squad

l‘wo members of the debate squad
of New York State College for
Teachers will meet in assembly to-
day with two students from the

ge to Arrive

As Third Big Light Presentation

You’d better watch out!

Santa Claus is coming to.Statei
State will open her Christmas
Package. When? Wednesday. De-
cember 13. Where? Page Hall.
Why? It’s State’s third Big Eight,
of course!

There will be really two distinct
parts to the evening's entertain-
ment. Those who saw the Christ-
mas tableaux last year are looking
forward to the impressive Christ-
mas Pageant that Elizabeth Mc-
Grath is planning for us . . . No
loss memorable will be the solemn
Jewish Candlelight service called
the Cliamtkdlt which is under the
direction of Judy Boxer. So mem-
bers of all religious faiths will
participate in the program, sym-
bolizing the unity of the season of
“Peace on earth, Good Will toward
men."

There will be a lighter side to
the entertainment too, which is
planned specially for the part of
State’s population that never in-
tends to grow up, the ones who
sneak up in the attic to run their
little brother‘s electric train while
the rest of the family is out.

There will be a real toy shop
with real. life-size toys. right on
the Page Hall State. A Jack-in-
the-Box will take over as two
sleepy little State girls wander into
the store. and when they doze off.
the toys will come to life. We’ll
see the tin soldiers (remember the
man shortage), Raggedy Aim, and
a very cute little French doll who
promises lots of entertaimnent.
But the Jack~ln-the-Box will re-
main master of the situation.

After visiting the enchanted toy
shop, all State‘s kiddies will go

down to the gym for the party
that’s being arranged by Helen.
“Everything’s perfect, but could you
spare a Christmas tree?" Slack.

Everyone will give out with
Christmas carols until they're
hoarse and then they'll hear that
old favorite, The Night Before
Christmas. At this point, all those
who don’t believe in Santa Claus
will find out the real truth and
those who have faith will hang up
their stockings in hopes that St.
Nicholas will soon be there —— and
he will. which just goes to show
you that State has a good record
in his little red book.

There will be refreshments. too,
and dancing for State’s jitterbugs,
or those who just like to dance.
So come on out and help open
State's Christmas package!
