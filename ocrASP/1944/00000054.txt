WAA Plans
Varied Program
For New Season

This week WAA brought it’s fall
program to an end and plans were
announced for the winter schedule.
The new program will go into ef-
fect after Thanksgiving vacation.

As in previous years basketball
will high light the schedule of
events. This year WAA expects to
have a large number of teams par-
ticipating in the league. This will
mean that the teams must get
organized immediately in order that
the league games can be played
off before the season closes.
Georgette Dun ’46, Mary Seymour
‘46, and Edna Sweeney ’47. cap-
tains of basketball, urge all those
who wish to enter a team in the
league. to do so before Thanks-
giving vacation. Practice will be
held in the gym on Monday and
Thursday from 4:15 pm. until 5:30
pm, Tuesday and Thursday from
7 pm. until 9 pm. and from 2
pm. until 4 pm. on Saturday.
Bowling Popular

Bowling rates next in popularity
on the sports calendar. Members
of the various group houses and
organizations on the campus, who
are interested in bowling, may en-
ter a team in the bowling league.
Nelli-e Glod ’46 and Judy Dube ’47
are co-captains.

Ping Pong has always been an
important phase of the winter sea-
son. Tournaments are scheduled to
start right after vacation. and con-
tests will be held iii both the
singles and doubles. Betty Rose
Hilt ’47. will be in charge.

Fencing, which drew quite a num—
ber of ardent supporters last year.
is again being offered on the pro-
gram. Chuck Axclrod '47 will su-
pervise this activity.

Swimming also plays a major
part in the winter program.
Basic courses in swimming and life
SflVillg will be offered for begin-
ners. Last year swimming was
initiated as a rivalry sport and
points were given for superiority
in speed and endurance tests. Two
rivalry points will again be award-
ed this year to the which is suc-
cessful in the rivalry meet. Jean
Grodcn ‘46 and Gloria Russo ’47
are co—captains.

The mid-winter season will begin
next semester and will be in ef-
fect until the spring vacation.

WAA Walk Waylaid
Fems Not Equal To- Equine

Camp Johnston that well
known haven in the hills which
is so dear to the hearts of hardy
Waa’ers. became the scene of
bustling activity last week end.
Ten of our more vigorous
members really took a trip up
there—and what a trip! The
highlight of the whole week end
was a hike to Massachusetts -
or rather an intended hike.
Somehow our dunigaree-clad
lassies got waylaid en route. It
seems that they came upon a
very interesting farmhouse
and a little boy with a horse. Of
course horseback riding was lots
more enticing than a long hike—
after all college routine is pretty
tiring.

 

 

 

Hockey Exhibition, St. Agnes

This Saturday and Sunday a
hockey meet will be held at St.
Agnes school in Albany. Teams
from all over this section of the
State will compete in a field hockey
tournament. This will be an excel-
lent opportunity to see some expert
playing.

MAA Opens
First Tourney

‘Art Kaufman, ’47, director of
M.A.A., has announced that the
annual men's ping-pong tourna-
ment will start on November 29. To
facilitate registration, a sheet has
been posted on the M.A.A. bulle-
tin board for those who wish to
sign up. The match will be run
off as those in the past. A list of
pairings will be posted and then it
will be up to the players to ar-
range their own matches.

The tournament itself will con-
sist of singles and doubles com-
petition. The singles will be lim-
ited to men, while both sexes will
be allowed to take part in the
doubles. This latter provision is
made because the number of ping-
peng playing males might not be
enough for a good doubles play-off.

Last year it was Bob Ferber that
dominated the tourney. He won the
singles championship from Phil La-
shinsky, three games to two. In the
doubles he and Al Beninati won.
Since Ferber has left college Lashln—
sky and Bob Horseman, '48. rivalry
ping-pong winner. are favored in the
current tournament.
