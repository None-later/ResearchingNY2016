STATES-MEN

We feel that it is part of our best interests to protect
the best interests of the fellows that are here at
State now so We should like to present this letter.

Dear” Editor:

The other day I happened to overhear several fellows
complaining about the living conditions at Sayles
Hall Annex. Said one “The living conditions for men
of this college are absolutely terrible; the worst of any

college in the State."

He went on to grumble about

having to walk over to Sayles Hall for his meals.

I contend that such criticism is a serious mistake
and will point out the luxuries of living at the Annex.
I think I should first mention the bathrooms (both of
them). Did you know that we actually had a surplus
of sinks? Well we did. We had four of them so one
day, two fellows, considering this, ripped a sink right

off the wall.

It fell on the floor, naturally, and there

it’s been for six weeks. We have two toilets here. For
sixteen fellows that's plenty. We also have a bathtub,
with shower attached. So you see, with all of these
facilities there is plenty of room for everyone and
anyone cleaning the bathrooms is consplcious by his

absence.

Another way in which we are very lucky is that
each of us has fifteen fellows to keep him company
(there were twenty in the house; we really hated to

see the other fellows leave).

There were three others

besides myself in a twelve by fourteen foot room. and
as I always say “The more the merrier."

And of course I can’t forget our bedroom, the attic.
There. in one long room. whose walls are wallboard
nailed onto the rafters. and which is fully illuminated
by one fifteen-watt light bulb (about the size of a
golf-ball. and very useful, because by the light of it, we
can almost see the front of the room, a good thirty

feet). fourteen of us have our beds.

In order that the

odor that always rises from our beds might not become
overpowering and, so that we won’t be suffocated, the
three windows on each end of ther oom are opened.
Then those soft, refreshing westerly breezes that we
are getting these days have full access to every part of
the room. through which they ripple all night picking
up a few blankets etc. on the way). But we don't mind
this at all because we’re rather used to low temper-

atures.

A temperature of fifty degrees in the Annex

isn’t unusual and keep us from getting sleepy while
doing homework, thus keeping our marks up.

The highlight of it all is that we are privileged to
go to Pierce or Sayles Hall (half of us go to Pierce,

half of us go to Saylesi for our meals.

Who can en-

vision anything more delightful to get up to than a
short walk to breakfast bucking a forty-mile wind in
the pitch blackness of night andw ith the mercury
parked at zero? This will be especially wonderful when

the snow is hip deep.

For all of this we pay the same price as the girls
who live at Sayles and Pierce do. For the same price
we get this added luxury. It gives us quite a surprise
because from what we read about the place in the
catalogue We thought it was just another group house.

We should certainly not complain and anyone who
does simply doesn’t know when he is well off.

Sincerely.

STORY OI" THE WEEK

We were in the postofficc the other day when a
prominent member of the Student body, a member of
Myskania and various other organizations walked in
to buy a stamp. Her very presence excited the admir-
ation of the group gathered about. probably because
they had been standing in line a while and had noth-
ing better to look at. As her turn come lit the window
she leaned through the window. nearly knoekiug over
the startled postmaster to wipe her stamp on the pad.
The postmaster scratched his head and sold to the
next customer in line, "Boy, I've seen ll lot of people
in my day but never anything like that."

THE FOURTH DEC. 7

Radio Tokyo (writes our favorite
correspondent in the Marshall Is-
lands) hammered away the days
before December 7 on the subject
of “The Note.” The Jap, says the
State Department communication
of December. 1941, was an ultima-
tum forcing Japan to attack and
save Asia from U. S. imperialism.
Results have proved the truth of
this. says Tokyo—and we concur,
you distortionlsts. On the third an-
niversary of the war which on-
meshes us, victory is distant. The
only good news from China in
months is that the Communists and
Kuomlntang seem to be nearing
agreement; this would release 500,-
000 Communist soldiers to fight the
Nips. The 14th Air Force has lost
nearly all its air bases in China.
MacArthur‘s brilliant invasion of
Lcyt-c has been succeeded by agon-
izing inch-i‘or-inch Jungle fighting.
A total of 227,000 Japanese and 21.-
000 Americans have died since war
began. while the Chinese dead is
in the millions. The Jap army of
4,000,000 has reserves of 2,000,000.
We have conquered an-hclci islands
in the Pacific, but officials admit
ollr main drive will have to come
from China-\vhich is more Tokyo‘s
than Chungklug's. The old strategy
of denying China aid—of immobiliz-
ing thousands of troops in Britain
and Stntcslde_while we “finish off"
Germany, has been stretched to the
ripping point. Japan is still boss in
Asia.

PROGRESS IN THE WEST

Lt.-Gen. Patton's Third Army is
inundating the Saar industrial re-
gion. Troops are now within sight
of Snarbruecken and have entered
Saareguemincs, after crossing the
Soar River at six points south of
Merzig.

The Red Army is by-pllssing Lake
Balaton in Hungary. 44 lnllcs from
Austria and 29 from Budapest.
Hungary is ripe for its knock-out
blow, following the surrender of
Roumanla and Bulgaria.

18 PEACE II‘ADING?

Germany is not yet a scalp on the
Allies' war belt. bllt today there
are cracks in her cuemies' united
front. Not on the battlefield. where
unity continues to corn success, bllt
in the crucial field of political and
social-economic relations. The ad-
ministration of liberated nations has
evoked disturbing portcnts. Corl—
trast British policy in Italy and
Greece with American and Soviet
reaction to that policy. as Well as
Soviet diplomacy in Yugoslavia and
France. Justllylng Britain's refu-

sal to accept as Italy’s Foreign Min—
ister the fighting anti-Fascist,
Count Carlo Sforza, Anthony Eden
told Commons Britain “has a right
to express an opinion to another
government about a Minister un-
der conditions such as these.” To-
day. Churchill and Eden will prob—
ably face a debate in Commons on
British intervention in Italy, which
caused the resignation of the Bon-
omi cabinet: and in Greece, where
British troops are fighting on the
government side against ELAS. the
militia of the anti-Nazi partisans,
EAM. Churchill branded the EAM
as Communist—no doubt a misun-
derstanding on his part, since only
two members of the liberal govern-
ment supported by EAM are Com-
munist—and therefore authorized
Lt. Gen. Scoble to lead Britons in
the Greek civil conflict. There is
fatal danger in Britain's dictating
the form of government the liber-
ated nations shall support. For
nearly a century. England has used
the nulintenance of law and order
as an excuse for instituting gov-
crmncnts in territories she con-
trolled. The tradition collided
sharply this week with the course
announced by the U. S. State de-
partment; henceforth. we will up-
hold the right of liberated countries
to elect governments of the people‘s
choosing. We are partly to blame
for the Greek dobnole. since last
summer we gave Britain right of
management in Greece. (Good
question: why?) Blll. it is not too
late to reunite.

Even sharper a rebuke of Britain’s
billndcring is Soviet Russia’s en-
lightened behaviour ill Yugoslavia.
A month ago, the Red Army rolled
into Belgrade, receiving an enthu-
siastic ovation from the people. The
USSR sent supplies and arms to
'I‘lto‘s partisans. even when Bri-
tain was trying to foist Millniio-
viteh as tho Yugoslaviuu's saviour.
But since liberation, the Soviet
Union has not once dictated the
govel'lunent the country shall have.
Yugoslavia has engineered a Feder-
ution containing six autonomous
districts. with their own schools,
local government and customs. Tito
will probably head the control gov-
ernment with its 28-lneinbcr cabi-
not. Mlleh of industry and agricul-
tllrc will be nationalized. and the
Welcome mat is definitely not out
for King Peter. Chaos in starving
Greece —r- order and progress in
Yugoslavia: which laboratory will
the World choose? And when will
Allied leaders reunite their political
thinking?

The First 100 Years . . .

Two recent events point to the fact that State
College is growing. One is the appropriation for
the postwar improvements planned for the college
which include a new gym, library and commerce
building. The second is the transition of a Student

Union from a possibility to a probability.

These

two things indicate that in 15 or 20 years State
College will be quite different.
With the new buildings an increased student body

may be expected.

The region wherein the two

dorms, Pierce and Sayles are now nocated will be-

come virtually a college quadrangle.

The Student

Union, if present plans are continued, will occupy

the space facing Western Avenue.

A gym and

possibly another dorm will replace what is now

Beverwyck Park.

These, plus the two present

dorms, will constitute a second campus.

The center of school activities will change from
Western Avenue to Ontario Street. A much larger
student body means more activities and more sports.
The concentration of living quarters in one vicinity
will mean more participation for more students.
The present, more—or-less provincial cast which
extra-curricular activities have, will be changed to
that corresponding to the larger universities.

We are at present unique among teachers colleges
‘3“. the slate and country. There are very fey slate
colleges wherein students are allowed to completely
handle their own extra-curricular activities with
little or no supervision from the faculty. The STATE
COLLEGE NEWS is alone among the teacher college
newspapers in the state which has no faculty ad-
viser. Our student body has grown from a small,
self-sufficient group to one which for scholarship
and activities can match any larger college.

All these changes have come about in the hundred
years since the College was founded in 1844. Last
year we celebrated our ccntenniel.. We marked the
transition from a Normal School to a Normal Col-

logo to a State College.

Our vision did not stop

there and we did not sit back feeling that all that

could be done had been done.

We can scc within

the next quarter century new progress. is the next

step University?

Where There's Smoke . .

Smoke!

ll‘ire!
great forest of the \\'cslcrn \V'orld \ ..

The smell of burnng flesh. The
ablaze. In

a moment (last Friday) long lines of (lager youths
poured out $108.80 worth of liquid fire-killer in
“stamp” old the flames. The fire choked, splullcr—
(-(l, fizzled. but didn't quite go oul. And now, the
forest is once again :1 roaring, blasting furnace. .r\n
urgent call for fire-fighters has been issued.

Stole Students!

"Slump" olll that fire today.

STATE COLLEGE NEWS, FRIDAY, DECEMBER I, 1944

 

60W—

To the Editor: .

Several active WAA enthusiasts
were unobtrusively taking a poll last
week. The topic was, “Do you read
Miss Hylind’s column?" and, sur-
prisingly enough, approximately ten
per cent of those asked did. The
reason for the neglect of that col-
umn, they said, was because it was
about everything but athletics and
what there was about sports was of
a critical nature.

I guess it‘s just human nature to
rebell against a write-up which
squelehes all the enthusiasm you
had, and spoils all the fun you had
at basketball practice the night be-
fore. Then also at hockey games
only the people who score points
get honorable mention, not the gal
who smoothly passed that ball to the
politically prominent wing or inner.
01' don’t the reporters know enough
about sports to make such an
analysis?

Everyone is not interested in
sports as everyone is not interested
in dramatics; but we who have that
inclination are all in favor of a
change in the policies of the sport
page. We suggest that either some-
one on the sports staff comes out

for sports or that someone really

Hillel Prepares Program
For Chamukah Holiday

Hillel will usher in the tradi-
tional Chamukah holiday Sunday
from 3 P. M. to 5:30 P. M. at
Tlfereth Israel Institute with a
program that will include singing.
dancing, entertainment. cards. and
refreshments.

Chamukah is the Hebrew cele-
bration commemorating the retak-
ing and reclennsing of the temple
following its looting and defilement
at the hands of the Syrians. In
order to rededicate the temple. the
Hebrew high priests rekindled the
oil they had burnt before. but found
only one vial. This vial lasted for
eight days where it had been ex-
pected to last for only one day.
Until this very day. the Hebrew

nation burns eight candles, one
each night, to commemorate this
miracle.

To the Editor:

“Lack of interest on the part of
the men, too little publicity, and a
late start," quoted the sports de-
partment of the STATE COLLEGE News
as the causes for the death of men’s
basketball. I think the following
facts should be presented to the
Student Association instead of mere
rumors accepted as facts.

You must have five men to make
a basketball team. Practice was held
by eleven. not seven as reported
in the News. Eleven out of
61 is a better percentage than 52
out of 1004 that gave blood. These
eleven men had had some experience
in high school and college basketball.
Yes, due to medical decree, only six
out of the eleven could play. five of
whom had to wear annoying "glass
guards.” There was the will to play
but physical defeacts can't be over-
come.

The last week in October the News
carried a fine story on the return
of basketball to State. How much
more publicity can we have?

Due credit should be given those
who wanted to play but could not.

tact all heads of school activities by
this time each week. Vera Kozak,
'45, Director, requests the coopera-
tion of all students concerned so
that State may receive its share of
publicity.

Miss Kozak also requests that all
uppcrclnssmen check on their Press
Bureau cards before the Christmas
holidays.

Scream Crash, Murder!
As The "Face" Stalks On

“Hey. repulsive! Oh — faux
pas! How do you do, Mr. Gar-
fall?” -

With screams emanating from
every corner of Draper and fe-
male students fainting to the
right and to the left of him,
the P.O.-born Mr. Garfall prom-
enaded through the halls of
State with his daughter, Flor-
ence. His glistening bald head
crouched deep in his coat collar.
his great, sunken_ eyes staring
fanatically into infinity, and his
jagged teeth jutting from his
gaping mouth, the FACE stalk-
ed on.

“Eeek's” were the thing but
the FACE was no mouse. Ah,
no — his true wolfish instincts
soon showed through as he
chased a poor, frightened little
“chicken” around the P0.

With a final free-for-ali, the
masquerade was over and the
FACE disrobed. The rubber mask
slid off easily and there stood
Al Bingham, Esq. — hastily
adopted father of “Guff.” The
gleeful crowd dispersed and the
monotony of living again
shrouded State. . .
