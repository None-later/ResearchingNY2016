“Peace on earth to men of good
‘ will." The season of yuletide cheer,
fellowship and good feeling is once
more upon us. The Christmas spirit
descends upon State, the PD. and
even upon the sports department.
In keeping with this customary Jol-
lity, we emerge, Scrooge-like into the
realms of sweetness and light —-
extending MAA and WAA each one
hand in friendship. An invitation
goes with it — an invitation to for-
get all outstanding difficulties and
start the new year in peace and
harmony.

To be practical, the situation boils
down to this. We are all working
toward the same end — the further-
ing of athletics at State. Naturally
we can accomplish this best by work-
ing together. We are frank to admit
that we cannot exist without MAA
and WAA—and conceited enough to
believe that we can help them.

Our suggestion is that our AA's
each appoint a representative to the
sports staff. The duty of this repre-
sentative would be to keep in touch
with activities of his organization
and communicate same to us at a
certain specified time each week.
This system was used by WAA and
worked out very well. We don’t know
why it was dropped but we would be
glad to see its resumption. News
would be authentic. accurate and
complete. Everyone would be happy.
Life would be beautiful.

Congratulations go to the clever
designer who is responsible for the
decoration of the WAA bulletin
board. It is attractive and neat ——
a great improvement over the sheet
of notebook paper type of poster.
We also think it a good idea to have
authority for use of the board come
from one person which is the new
WAA policy. If all organizations
would cooperate as well with the ef-
fort being made to improve the ap-
pearance of our halls, the powers-
that-be would have cause for Joy.
Camp Johnston Plug

Camp Johnston does not seem to
have come in for its usual publicity
on the sports page. The snow and.
believe it or not, a sled parked in a
corner of the RC. have reminded us
of the attraction of that place. A
week-end at camp is really a unique
experience. It offers an opportunity
to get away from it all and come
close to nature a la Thoreau. The
winter season is perhaps the best
at camp. A pond nearby provides
skating on non~dug up ice. a rarity
which is not to be found on local
ponds. The surrounding scenery is
whiteness unmarred by the soot and
grime of the city atmosphere. Hik-
ing. tobogganing. eating, sitting
around the fire and sleeping suc-
ceed in filling up the rest of the
week-end sufficiently and to the
satisfaction of all concerned.
Presents For All

Continuing in the foot-steps of
last year’s edition. we distribute our
Christmas gifts via our column. It
does save such a lot of wear and
tear—and money.

First, to the beloved P.O.. goes a
quantity of brand new. shiny, type-
writers—that work.

The 00-01) gets a big sign reading
“Out of Cigarettes. hershey bars.
and gum."

We present MAA and WAA
sports page that really “understands”
them.

Myskanla gets lots of good things
in its stocking in return for their
work in providing a merrier Christ-
mas for 140 Albany orphans.

All students with tonges hanging
out for cigarettes receive a package
of Bull Durham and a rolling
machine complete with wrappers of
their favorite brands to give that
certain illusion.

To the library goes a staircase ten
feet wide leading from the lower
hall of Draper.

Practice teachers get skates for
that long trek to Milne and snow-
shoes for when the door to the audi-
torium is locked.

State college audiences are given
more first—rate entertainment like
the “Damask Cheek."

 Teams Compete

ln  Hoop League

‘1 Schedule Announced;
League Rules Compiled

Sixteen teams have signed up to
compete in the WAA basketball
league, according to Edna Sweeney,
captain of the sport. Last year only
eleven teams were formed. The
schedule will be full and teams will
have to comply strictly with the rules
of the tournament in order that all
gamse can be fit in the season. Fol-
lowing are the rules for the league:
League Rules

1. A team which is to play must
be on the floor at the scheduled
time, 7:00, 7:50, or 8:40.

2. Five minutes lateness means
forfeit of the game.

3. Three forfeits eliminates a team
from the league.

Tournament games are scheduled
for Monday and Thursday after-
noons and Tuesday and Wednesday
nights. There will be practice ses-
sions on Saturday afternoons from
two till four for all those wishing to
come.

Captains are warned to watch the
WAA bulletin board for schedules of
dates and times and keep their teams
informed of their playing schedules.
Teams

Teams participating are: Stokes
Hall, Newman Hall, Moreland Hall,
Chi Sig, Wren Hall, Kappa Delta,
Psi Gam, Phi Delta, Beta Zeta, Al-
pha Epsilon Phi, Sayles Hall. Rares,

Dynamiters, Whiz Kids, Tommy
More. and Gamma Kap.
Outcome?

The outcome of the league is ex-
tremely unpredictable at this point.
All the established teams have lost
valuable players and have added
unknown quantities to their rosters
since last year. The new teams
which have been formed this year
AE Phi, Tommy More. Whiz Kids,
Stokes, Dynamiters, have of course,
never been seen in action on State
court and add even more to the un-
certainty of the outcome.

The Freshmen and Sophomores
are coming out quite regularly for
practice and a spirited Rivalry bas-
ketball game looms in the offing.
Schedule

The schedule of games from the
end of Christmas vacation until ex-
ams is as follows:

Christmas Recess Is Here, .
Aihelefes Siori HIbernofing

“Dashing through the snow,

In a one-horse open sleigh.”

Those world always send a
warmning thrill down the backs
of all the lovers of the “good old
days.” To the more modern
minded of the present generation
it means bitter, freezing rides
that seem to have no destination
as well as no reason. Those up-
to-date individuals much prefer
the cozy comfort of a sleek sedan.
No gas!

Where does all this digressing
lead? To the realization that the
members of MAA and WAA are
either going to spend their Xmas
vacation storing up heat for the
rest of Albany’s wicked winter or
get out the sleighs. It is the
astute guess of the sports staff
that a great deal of heat will be
stowed away. Hoardersl

 

 

 

MAA Pool Tourney
To Begin Competition

Ping-pong is still hanging fire as
far as the doubles matches are con-
cerned. Even with the ping-pong
unfinished MAA is turning its spot-
light on pocket billiards. Art Kauf-
man has announced that his assis-
tant, George Hess, will be in charge
of this tournament. Hess beat out
Kaufman for the championship last
year and is well qualified to promote
this one.

Hess plans to start the tournament
directly after the Christmas holi-
days. The usual sheet will be posted
on the MAA bulletin board to
facilitate registration. Everyone who
wishes to compete should sign up as
soon as possible.

The tournament will be conducted
along the same lines this year as it
was last. The individual contestants
will be paired off and the number of
qualifying rounds will depend on the
quantity of men that are interested
enough to sign up. If the players
tear into their matches the tourna-
ment could be over before the Jan-
uary exams. If not. it will have to
be held over into February.

Bowling League

Will Start Soon

By BOB SORENSON

Art Kaufmann has just completed
a survey which will rock Draper
from its cornerstone. By posting an
innocent sheet of paper on the MAA
bulletin board he found that 22 men
of State have at least three fingers
on one hand and can lift the sum
total of 16 pounds.

Quick to capitalize, Arthur, who
at this writing is still in his knight-
hood, has started to organize a
league. Four masters of the manly
art have been chosen as captains.
They are, namely: Bob Sullivan,
Bruce Hansen. Harry Inglis and
some proud fellow who possesses a
carton of R. J. Reynolds coffin nails.

It is hoped that the teams will be
chosen and arrangements made so
the first latex sphere may be sent
hurling at the pins soon after St.
Nick makes his annual trip with his
old bag (no one as yet has ever found
out her name.) The games will
probably be bowled at night.

It might do the fellows good to
take a few hour each week to lull
in the alleys and roll a game or two.
I can forsee that this column will
be quoted in classes by unprepared
bowlers.

There Is Some Talent

Many of the men will probably
remain “dark horses" until after the
league is under way. It has. however,
been rumored in reliable pin boy
circles that State has a few very
good keglers to send to the foul line
(oh let’s leave that foul line out
of this)*

Harry Inglis. who led the State
men to victory over Med School last
week, should rank among the
leaders. Silent Jim Farley isn’t ex-
actly a pin boy’s dream, while Bob
Sullivan seems to be the best of the
southpaws. If Bruce Hanson can
keep his mind off the girls on the
next alley he may press the boys for
individual honors.

Here’s a hope for spirited compe-
tition and may the best team win!

*(George Hess would like to know
which is the foul line.)

WAA Bowling Laegue

WAA bowling will begin immedi-
ately after Christmas. Teams have
already signed up and are all set
to go. The season is full and the
competition is expected to be
tough. A trophy is awarded to the
championship team at the end of
the season. Last year’s winner was
Psi Gamma. Rules will be an-
nounced after vacation.

GREETINGS

 

‘7/V‘7‘a a] 41/2414

As this weeks TNT’er. we have
chosen Peg Bostwick. ’46's represen-
tative to WAA Council.

Who would ever think that little
Peg would have the energy to take
part in so many and such varied
sports? Yet this is just the case.

High School Activities

At high school, in Amsterdam, Peg
was active in most of the sports of-
fered at the school, being especially
interested in softball. skiing and
tennis.

Here at college, Peg has earned
credit in four sports every year. Last
year she was awarded the WAA key
for participation in college sports.

As captain of fencing last year,
Peg rose faithfully at nine o’clock
every Saturday which is enough to
put her name down in history. And
then there were the work-outs with
the linament Just as fiathfully every
Saturday night.

All of the Seniors and Juniors,
who witnessed last year’s softball
game between the Seniors and
Juniors, will recall that Peg worked
so hard during the game that she
broke her finger offering it up she
said, “for a good cause." And, then
there was her brief—but spectacular
basketball career.

Elected V. P.

Last year, Peg was elected Vice-
president of WAA. Since she was
also elected to the presidency of
Newman Club. which is a major of-
fice, it was necessary for her to
give up WAA vice-presidency. She
is still representative of her class
however, on WAA Council.

In reviewing therefore, Peg's par—
ticipation and achievements in the
field of sports, we feel qualified in
choosing her as this week's out—
standing WAA personality.

 

Fencing Classes Slated;
Better Turnout Requested

The first fencing practice took
place last Saturday morning at 10.
Only six girls showed up but it is
hoped that WAA'ers will come out
more strongly for the sport after
vacation when there is more time.

The next class will be held on the
first Saturday morning after vaca-
tion at 10 AM. There will be an-
other sign-up sheet on the bulletin
board the week before for all those
still interested.

Season Plans

Included in the plans for the sea-
son. as announced by Chuck Axel-
rod. will be contest bouts with La
Salle Academy. The instructor for
the classes is a senior from the
Academy. He is well-known to
those in last year's fencing classes.
In the bouts held last year with
LaSalle. he was a prominent and
skillful opponent.

WAA is offering, in fencing, a
chance to indulge in a healthful,
poise-building sport. Chuck hopes
that more girls will take advantage
of the opportunity.
