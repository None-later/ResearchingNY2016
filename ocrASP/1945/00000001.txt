"Crimson TideHHolds
Class Banquet Tonight

The annual Senior banquet will be
held this evening at lho 'l‘cn Eyck
lioth ul ti PM. Miss Joan Smith.
'45, President of the class, is general
chairman of lhc ul‘i'uir.

As in former years. the class will
pay a portion of the bill. amounting
this year to $1.00. The remaining
$1.125 will be paid by the members
of the class ultending the banquet.

The following committees have
been appointed: cntertuinmeut. Pu~
tricia Mulcuhy, assisted by Robert
Loucks and Edna Marsh; welcoming
of guests, Anna Dillon. assisted by
Margaret Schlott, Pauline Klein and
Betty Kay Walsh.

There will be two members of
the faculty present, but these have
not been announced.

Tetley-Kardos, an American born
and made musician, early began his
music studies. At the age of eight
he was writing melodies and at
eleven he gave his first recital.
From then until he was fifteen, Tet-
ley-Kardos managed and arranged
his own annual concerts on his
native west coast. During this time
he became an accomplished accom-
panist and was later to be engaged
by such outstanding artists as Lily
Pons, Lotte Lehmen. Gladys Swart-
hout and Grace Moore.

When he was thirteen, Tetley-
Kardos had his first song “Spanish
Serenade" published. Following this
in rapid succession came a radio
contract, a widely acclaimed recital
at the Hollywood Bowl, and several
solos with the Los Angeles Philhar-
monic Orchestra.

Still in his twenties, Tetley-Kardos
is called a “musical institution” on
the west coast where he is accus—
tomcd to play thirty concerts a
season —— a five and six times re-
peater, by popular demand. Of his
appearance in the Hollywood Bowl it
was said. "Musically sensitive. Rich-
ard Tetley-Kardos chose a work of
hidden beauty for his Bowl debut . ."

When he appeared with the
Los Angeles Philharmonic Orchestra
for the first time, a music critic
wrote. “The Los Angeles Orchestra
chose Richard Tetley-Kardos to be
soloist and the large audience ap-
proved the choice enthusiastically.
At. the conclusion of his performance
of the Beethoven (Emperor) Concer-
to. he was recalled again and again.
Distinctly important among the
younger generation of pianists and
equal to the best of them, he has
lhc gift of beguiling his hearers."

Admission to the Choral Concert
will be by student his ticket. Regu—
lur tickets will be $.00 and student
tickets $.85.

Simon To Direct

Satirical Comedy,

"The Pot-Boilers"

Assembly To Witness
One-Act Melodrama

“The Potboilers," a one-act play.
by Alice Gerstenberg, will be present-
ed in today’s assembly, under the
direction of Josephine Simon, '45.
It was to have been a presentation
of last year's Advanced Dramatic’s
Group, but Miss Simon’s illness
prevented its presentation.

The play is a satirical comedy
concerning the problems of play
directing. The cast includes: Miss
Sud, Marion Buetow '46; Miss Wood-
by, Joan Alverson, '47; Miss Ivory.
Patricia Mulcahey, '45; Mr. Ruler,
James Crandall, '46; Mr. Inkwell,
Wilbur Shelf, '47; Mrs. Pencil,
Irene Heck, '45; and Mr. Ivory’s
father, Clyde Cook, '47.

The plot deals with the wicked
machinations of Mr. Inkwell and
Mrs. Pencil who hope to lure the
cool, demure heroine from the bea-
ten path. Since no villainess is
threatening without a foreign ac—
cent, Miss Heck will render her
lines in that manner. Not only does
the plot include an actual strike
threat but it will be highlighted by
the fatal shooting of one of the
main characters.

Miss Buetow will be heard as the
director-author of the “most stu-
pendous drama of the century."
The cold, calculating villain intent
upon gaining the pure heart of the
heroine, come what may, is por—
trayed by Wilbur Shift, while slink-
ing across the stage as the wordly-
wise temptress involved passionately
with the villain will come Miss
Hecht. The innocent center of chaos
will be Patricia Mulcahey who is in
the throes of despair until she is
snatched from fate's clutches by the
handsome hero, James Crandall.

The remainder of assembly will
be devoted to announcements.

In “The House Divided,” Mary Te-
lian, ’47, a young German girl repre-
sents the anti-Nazi element among
the German people themselves, in
her opposition to the fanatic ten-
dencies of her Nazi family. The
mother, Betty Rose Hilt, ’47, wavers
between her maternalistic desires
and her devotion to the Cause, while
the sister, Joan Mather, ’46, is in-
doctrinated so completely with the
philosophy that she has become a
Nazi machine. Frau Schiller, Lois
Fillman, ’47, is the powerful leader
of the Nazi women, ruthless, dicta-
torial, and ever-increasing the con-
flict in this divided family.

Expressionistic Drama

“Overtones,” the earliest of the ex-
pressionistic drama, presents an in-
teresting situation when Marianne
Davis, '46 and Ellen Maloney, '47, en-
gage in women's eternal conflict,
the fight with the inner self. The
one, a model, beautiful and wealthy,
desires the love and affection of the
other’s husband, while she in turn
lives only on love, and hungers for
riches and security. The inner selves
present an unusual stage struggle in
their constant attempt to dominate
the real self. Julia Boxer and Shir-
ley Gross, ’47, portray these intrigu-
ing inner selves.

An entertaining play bringing out
the farce of bachelorhood will be
seen in “Why I Am A Bachelor."
Clyde Cook, ’47, the lecturer, gloat-
ingly watches the progress of this
seemingly happy marriage. From
romance and wedded bliss, through
discordant harmony on anniversa-
ries, the enamored pair finally end
in actual physical struggle, pleasing
the bachelor beyond all bounds.
This transition from wedded bliss
offers plenty of opportunity for
humor and comedy.

Emotional outlet, internal strug-
gles shown vividly on the stage, and
the disadvantages of romance will be
brought out in this variety of un-
usual dramas.

Intermlssion Entertainment

Entertainment between plays will
feature Helen Lengyell at the piano
with Helen Kissel and Alice Wil-
liams, '48, as vocalists. The heads of
committees are as follows: House,
Joan Alverson, ’47; Sets and Lights,
Marion Beutow, '40; Props. Mary
Sanderson. '46; Costumes, Priscilla
Weinstein, '47: Publicity, Patricia
Sheehan, '47. The prompters for
the three plays are: Dorothy Knapp,
Elizabeth Margot. and Ruth Lilian-
t‘eld, Sophomores.

fore all students will be admitted by
