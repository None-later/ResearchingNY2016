_ There are, in State College, some frustrated in-
. dividuals who love to make life miserable for every-
one else. Usually they are students who have failed
to attain their original objective in college activities.
The first semester is a prime time for these sadists—
with a crop of still new freshmen and a goodly num-
ber of Sophomores who suddenly realize that their
college life is passing rapidly. Their psychology
is simple—like throwing bricks.

“Hello, Frosh. Did you get a bid?” The fresh- ‘

man shakes her head negatively. “Too bad. Guess
that fixes you. No use even trying out for an
activity. The sororities have them all wrapped
up!” Triumphantly she marches off. The dis-
illusioned little freshman takes a last long look at
the activities’ offices. Sorrowfully she wipes away
her tears and, with a sigh, opens “The F undamen-
tals of Physical Science.”

Of course, a pledge or new member of the so-
called weaker sororities is often game sport. But
even sororities get monotonous after awhile, so
Frustrated Hunter is off to new hunting grounds.

“You Jewish?” she asks. A nod. “Myskania’s
something you can dream of, chum. Don’t you

know State is famed for its religious prejudices?” ,,

As she sweeps off in a trail of sulfurous fragrance,

she leaves behind a girl, bewildered, puzzled, who ‘
solemnly places a chip on her shoulders for pro- 9
tection from a rumor, and, likely as not, keeps it .s-.

there for four years. .
Now—the sororities are unhappy (for being
painted in such a black, blalck shade), the fresh-
men with bids are unhappy, the freshmen Without
bids are unhappy; the Jews are unhappy (because
they don’t have a chance) and everyone else is un-
happy at being falsely accused of religious intol-
erance . . . But, oh, the Frustrated Hunter is happy!
She thinks joyously of the Mock Turtle dropping
salty tears into the prospective Mock-Turtle soup,
and she laughs and laughs . . . _

But somewhere along the line, our charming
sadist had misplaced her glasses, and, being far-
sighted, she couldn’t see the things happening right
in front of her . . . that is, she couldn’t until the
Ghost of State College Present took her on a tour.
And so . . .

“But it can’t be” she screamed, pointing to Mys-

kania. “They're all from different sororities—and
from different religions, too!”
, On and on went the tour until all the activities
had been seen . . . and in the majority there were
independents and sorority girls, and there were
Catholics, Protestants, and Jews. In some few she
saw her sad tales of woe in action—the few where
State students lacked the courage to attempt to
break a sorority ring and left them in undisputed
possession—«and rightly so, for St. George’s dragon
was never slain by the rabbit-hearted.

Frustrated Hunter awakened with a sob as her
ears rang with the rattling of chains, and shackled
students threw off their bonds of mental slavery;
and little independents and sorority girls of all
faiths, entwined arms and tripped merrily off to
school.

lilorul: 99% energy, ambition, talent.

WM 4W

By SHIRLEY PASSOW

“Happy New Year!” echoed with rare irony when
1945 took over. The German counter-offensive was
beating our forces back into Belgium and in the Saar
region. Budapest withstood the Red Army and war
news from China trickled into nothing. British and
American newspapers were luxuriating in mutual
mud-slinging—-—the British mocked our missing foreign
policy, we flayed the Churchill disaster in Greece——
when abruptly we discovered Von Rundstedt's near-
blltz. The mud splattered out, and thaw who had
been calling for greater unity among the free world’s
leaders were heard again. In this country, the new
aides to Secretary of State Stettinius were sworn in,
unscarred by Congress’ attack; all but Archibald
MacLeish had been accused of monopolist business
and pro-Fascist records. Henry Wallace remained the
man without a job, though hopeful rumors linked
him with the Commerce department. The American
press scored Labor for provoking munitions shortages
on the Western Front. though Senator Mead and
others had blamed shortages on inadequate supply
lines and other military factors. As the filial dash o.
arsenic in our post New Year‘s cocktail, Rep. Rankin
moved the resurrection of the Dies Committee ("Red
Herring's on the line — down payment required?)
Something like reason returned with Pres. Roosevelt‘s
National Service Act demand on Jan. 6. Industrial
manpowor is needed in war plants—-whosc executives
last week were whistling about reconversion to civilian
production. Today's estimate is 900,000 workers, to be
recruited from 4.000.000 deferred men. The President
urng a draft of 10.000 nurses. but professional lead-
ers frowned on a bill which wouldn't draft all women.
(Watch to see if the color line on thousands of eligi-
ble Negro nurses is now relaxed by the pending draft.)
Finally. nearly 11 inilllon men will be inducted into
the Army in the next six months—double earlier fig-
ures. Unless Congress stalls with gap-filler bills (like
Rep. May‘s Work or Fight Bill) the National SCl'Vlcc
Act will carry this nation into the war at least waist
ccep.

Now that charges and counter-charges have lost.

Discussion of Union

Slated for Friday

Student Council’s resolution for
the organization and administration
of a proposed State College Student
Union, based on three reports al-
ready published in the Sum Cor.-
LG Nws, will be presented to the
Student Association for discussion
Friday. The whole period will be
devoted to this purpose, and no an-
nouncements will be made.

Voting on the proposal will not
be held until the first assembly in
the second semester. Florence Gar-
fall, ’45, President of Student Asso-
ciation, has stressed that the stu-
dents will be voting on the proposal
to turn all funds over to the holding
corporation and to form a Student.
Board. The voting will not concern
the location or building plans of the
project, as these factors will be de-
termined at a later date.
Organization of Student Board

The important thing now, Miss
Garfall stated, is to get the Student
Board organized so that they can
begin work immediately. They will
start work with the collection of
pledges from members of the Class
of ’44, and will conduct a vigorous
campaign to interest members of
recent graduating classes in the pro-
ject also. The board will have the
power to name its own committees,
and will draw up a constitution for
approval by members of Student As-
sociation.

The resolution provides for a board
of eight people — five students, two
faculty members, and one alumnus.
The funds will be turned OVer to the
New York State College for Teachers
Benevolent Association, Inc., (the
holding corporation of the Alumni
Association), as a trust fund. The
board will take care of records, col-
lect pledges, and in general govern
the organization. The Benevolent
Association will direct the use of
the money and will make reports of
its activities to a Student Union
Board. In preparation for the dis-
cussion, Dr. John Sayles, President
of the College, spoke in assembly last
week about the operation of the
association and answered questions
(if the students.

Student Council,
Big 8 Committee
Discuss Goals

Members of the “Big 8“ Committee
attended the regular Student Coun-
cil meeting Wednesday night to dis-
cuss the goals of the project and a
plan for the distribution of the pro-
fits. This was the last council meet-
ing of the semester.

Last spring the Big Ten netted
approximately $1,800, and Student
Association voted to invest. the
money in War Bonds and event-
ually use the funds for war vetcrnns‘
scholarships. This year, again. the
committee will present several pos—
sible uses for thc profits and State
students will vote on the proposals.

It was announced at the Couiicll
meeting that a permanent. chart of
school organization offices will be
put up in the Student Couiicll office
In the Commons by the end of this
semester or the beginning of next
semester. The chart will be ur-
raiigcd so tliai the names of office
holders may be changed from year
to year.

STUDENT UNI-ON.....

Method of payment as suggested by the Student Union Investigating

Committee.

According to the report: “If the student Union is combined with a
residence hall as suggested in our second report, it should be possible to
build the entire building at a cast of $300,000. With the Union occupying
half of the space. we (the student body) would contribute $150,000. That
amount of money could be collected in a ten year period outlined as

follows :

Possible receipts up to March 1, 1955:

between the two dormitories. Proper-
ty not already owned by the school
may be purchased at the time of
building. Two wings will be attached
for use as dorms. This arrangement
will be made in order to secure a
definite income to help defray the
cost of upkeep. since the union itself
will not bring in any large amount
of funds. The two projects, the dorms
and the union, would be run sepa-
rately. and money from the Student
Tax will be used for the year’s
operating cost.

Rumpus Room Provided

Many of the facilities now lacking
in the school will be provided in the
Student Union, if they are not in-
cluded in the program of expansion
which the college has planned for
the post-war era. The building will
probably be two or three storys high.
A cafeteria, grill, soda fountain. and
kitchens will provide meals and re-
freshments for the larger student

he whispered hoarscly, “The an-

he thumbed through a book of

Inter-Varsity Fellowship

will be held tomorrow at 0 P. M. in
the Wellington Hotel at 130 State
Street, Mr. Paul Bcckwith, who
formerly worked with Billy Sunday.
noted Evangelist minister. will be
the principal speaker of the evening.

An inspiring song service will open
the meeting. Special music will also

dents urc invited to attend this

dents l‘rom several other colleges in
this area.

body. Plans also include a central
lobby or reception rooms, lounges,
game or rumpus rooms, a room for
dances (the new gym will be avail-
able for large dances), browsing
rooms, a large dining room for ban-
quets. private dining rooms, meeting
rooms. offices for active organiza-
tions, and rooms for alumni. com-
muters, and guests.

Farrell House Not Suitable

At the end of school last year,
when the original resolution for a
Student Union was passed. it was
suggested that Farrell House might
be used now for that purpose and a
fund started for a permanent union
to be erected in 1955. A committee
was appointed by Student Council
to determine the advisability of such
a move. and a thorough investiga-
tion of the facilities available at
Farrell House was made. The com-
mittee, in a report made in late
October. stated that the cost of up-
keep and repairs would not make a
Student Union in the house worth
while.

Included in the resolution which
will be voted on next semester is a
proposal for joining the Association
of College Unions. :1 national or-
ganization which acts as a clearing
house for tips and suggestions from
Unions already active to colleges
which are planning such projects

for the post-war era.

Coin arison of Unions
To (give State Ideas

Although the phrase “student
Union" is something comparatively
new here at State, the idea behind
it is fairly well established in Ameri-
can Universities and Colleges. Not
only are there Unions on numerous
campuses in the United States and
Canada — there is also a national
Association of College Unions whose
purpose is to provide an opportunity
for member organizations to co-
operate in advancing their common
interests,-and to assist in the forma-
tion of new student groups.

The picture “A Day in a Student
Union" shown during assembly last
Friday, gave a general idea of the
main purposes and uses of such a
building. There are many similar
institutions at colleges about the
same size as State which may serve
to guide those planning State's Stu-
dent Union.

Union Activities

The activities encouraged by the
various Student Unions seem to be
endless. The Willard Straight Hall
at Cornell University, for example,
is especially proud of its theatre.
which is said to be one of the most
modern amateur theatres in an
Eastern college. There is also a
special room for Music and Art. in
addition to numerous offices and
well planned recreational facilities.
Kansas State College, like State, is
planning for a new Union. They
will spend about $860,000 and hope
to begin construction as soon as war
conditions permit.

Included in the plans are a large
ballroom and a smaller dance hall,
separated by a large service kitchen
so that the rooms may be used for
banquets; a large general lounge;
three lounges for faculty and alum-
ni; an art and music lounge; at
browsing room; a cafeteria; a col-
lege postoffice where all students
will receive mail; a game room; a
suite of offices for student publica-
tions; 12 bowling alleys; 16 activity
rooms; a religious center; and six
private dining rooms. These are ob-
viously very lavish plans, but it does
give a good idea of what students
will want and expect in the post-war
union.

War And Business

A variety of activities go on in the
typical college union from morning
to night. Last March an auction for
the benefit of the Red Cross was
held at the Illini Union, University
of Illinois, as part of a day—long
Mardl Gras. The auction consisted
of privileges donated by deans, pro-
fessors, and students; shoe shining
by a professor of engineering; a
manicure by a French professor: a
cut in any class. offered by the
dean of women to the highest bid-


OI Sororities

nounced a mass meeting of all the
sororities on campus on Monday, at
7:30 P.M., in the Commons. All
sorority members are obliged to
attend.

Following the business meeting
each sorority must present one act
for the entertainment. Dorothy
Falk, '45, member of Alpha Epsilon
Phi is chairman of the entertain-
ment. Bridge and dancing will also
be enjoyed.

Miss Carmany states that the pur-
poses of the joint meeting are to
introduce new pledges to the group
as a whole, to foster inter-sororal
fellowship and to plan for the com-
ing Inter-sorority Big 8 on April 21.

During the first few weeks of
rushing, freshmen become faces and
names under the constant strain of
weekend entertainment and silent
period. Sorority members seldom
are acquainted with the names and
appearance of all the pledges of
other sororities. Their presentation
to the group as a whole will eliminate
this situation.

The fostering of inter-sororal
spirit, another purpose of the meet-
ing, is necessary since inter-sororal
cooperation composes a large part
of college activity. Such activities
as The Inter~sorority Ball were suc-
cessful because of this cooperation.

Many unions are doing their part
in making the accelerated freshmen
feel that they “belong” by encourag-
ing these students to participate in
different activities.

Just in case there are some who
feel that unions place too much em-
phasis on social life to the detriment
of studies, there follow some quotes
about the value of such organizations
from men who are in a position to
know.

“College is an esthetic experience.
This memorial union project would
raise the scholarship of the college
by adding to this experience.” ——
Professor M. Olson, Milwaukee State
Teachers College.

"The real thing for the student
is the life and environment that
surrounds hlin. Students must live
together and eat together, talk and
smoke together. Experience shows
that this is how their minds really
grow.” ~« Professor Stephen Leacock.
