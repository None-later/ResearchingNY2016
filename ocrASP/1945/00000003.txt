Bowlers Double In Brass
When Pin-Boys Disappear

Any fagged men around school
should be shown compassion by
all. The bowling last Tuesday
night proved to be much more
strenuous than any one ex-
pected.

First of all, they were speeded
up by a tyrannical alley oper-
ator who wanted to get the al-
leys cleared for the next league
to follow. Secondly, there was
a dearth of pin boys and the
one under-sized waif who was
posing as one often was on the
brink of disaster with all his
jumping from one alley to the
other.

Time after time, as soon as
he had thrown his second ball,
one of the boys would dash back
to the pit to give the harried
sticker a much-needed hand. At
the end of the match most of
the boys were beat.

Ah yes, bowling is a rugged
sport.

 

 

 

Sport of KniglilL
Open to All

Pool—for years men have bent
over a green table and with
lengthy sticks have been poking
these woods at innocently colored
balls only to watch them plink into
deep holes at the tables edge.

Since the days of yore this kingly
pastime has enchanted the might-
iest possessors of muscles who,
rather than being out jousting in
the fields, would bend in knightly
attire over feudal oak tables and

chop at these spheres with their 4

cues.

The present-day sport has come
down with slight innovations. Even
now tuxedoed males still fight for
the various pocket-billiard crowns.

With artistic talent and dilated
pupil of the eye you can walk into
any pool emporium of the nation
and there watch the inheritors of
this majestic game.

The lights hang low with their
diffused rays piercing the smoke of
these nicotiners as the shiny balls
go caroming off the sides of the
table and their resounding clicks
echoing throughout the parlor.

Here at State there dwell several
connesieurs of the art such as Hess,
Kaufman. Sorensen and Lehman.
No, you may not see them play in
the knightly attire of yesteryear
but they nevertheless take their
game serious being true yogic.

In Third Match

Bowling captured the MAA spot-
light for the first post-vacation
week. Last Saturday afternoon Al-
bany Med opposed State in the third
renewal of their series. Med, sparked
by the brilliant bowling of Hank
Wolfe, walked off with the match
2301 pins to 2210 for State. Wolfe
was the big gun all the way for
Med with a high single game of 198
and a three game total of 570.

States best effort came in the
second game when George Hess
cracked out the afternoon’s high
single game of 208. Following close
behind was Bob Sorensen with 179.
Sorensen’s three game total was
high for the State keglers.

League Under Way

Tuesday night was the inaugural
for MAA’s newly formed bowling
league. Four out of the five teams
saw action, Dave Lehman's gang the
only one to be left—out. His team will
do its work-out next week.

Bob Sorensen’s Flashes started
strong, winning the first game of
their set, but they faltered after
that. Bruce Hansen’s Whiz Kids
came back strong to take the next
two games. and total pins. Soren-
sen battered out high scores for the
Flashes with 178 and 490. Bob Horse-
man was the big man for the Whiz
Kids with 186 and 420.

In the evening’s other match Har-
ry Inglis’ Strikers subdued Bob Sul-
livan’s All Americans three games to
one. The Strikers had the high team
game of the night with 795. Bill
Baldwin of the Strikers had the only
200 game of the night, hitting it
exactly on the nose. Farley has the
best three game series for the
Strikers with 463. Sullivan's 190 and
Whytok’s 450 were high for the All
Americans.

Campus-ed Queen Crowned
Behind Lavish Prison Walls

Ta-ta-ta the trumpet’s blare,
the torches gleam. old King
Sayies is ushered in. His mag-
nanimous presence celebrated the
crowning of the campus-ed queen.
Which daintly night - gowned
beauty would bear the title,
Campus-ed queen of Sayies Hall?
Everyone held her breath while
King Sayies walked Myskania-
like around the candidates. Fin-
ally he paused and placed the
trembling crown atop the golden-
haired Virginia Day.

The story behind the news de-
veloped when “Keeper of the
Quiet” Elsie Whipple handed out
engraved campuses to Betty Phil-
lips, ’46, Mary Carey. Virginia
Day, Dorothea Silvernail, and
Jenny Driphas, Sophs. Amid
cursing and screams of rage
O’Grady and Mac Carthy incub-
ated a ‘hot idea.’ They would
sponsor a campus-ed queen con-
test. Beauty and brains com-
peted alike until the eventful
night of January 30. Now in
Sayies Hall over an imaginative
fireplace this motto appears:
“Silence may be golden; but hub-
bub yields a crown.”

 

to the students in assembly this
morning to replace the original
motion concerning Student Union

sented. The Student Union Investi-
gating Committee with the ap-
proval of the students who proposed
amendments has added six new
provisions to the original motion
