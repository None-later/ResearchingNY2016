- By Joan llylind ——-

 

Not snow, nor coal shortages, nor
lack of news can stop the Sports
staff from completion of Its accus-
tomed round of duties—the news
must go through.

I A tough break for the WAA win-
ter program is the coal shortage and
resulting cancellation of basketball
and bowling contests. The loss of
a week’s time from an already
crowded schedule presents serious
difficulties. Maybe last years dire
prediction that team members would
have to stay on for summer school
in order to finish up the tourney,
may yet come true.

The Silver Lining

The only consolation we can see
for WAA is that at least this is one
thing that nasty Sports editor wont
be able to blame on them. Even a
person so obviously unintelligent
must come to the same conclusion
on the subject as did Mark Twain.

Seriously though, we sympathize
with te WAA program makers. News
that the gym will be open tomorrow
and that games can be made up at
that time is an encouraging note.
We’re sure that everything will
work out all right. There are some
mighty energetic gals in charge of
the basketball league.

So Sorry

It seems as if we were slightly off
in our predictions concerning the
outcome of the league. . .Apologies
to the Gamma Kap squad for their
being overlooked in the list of pos-
sible cup-winners. Anyone who has
seen these gals burning up the
boards must admit that they are a
remarkably smooth and powerful
team. Their victory over KD has
raised their stock and been the
cause for considerable juggling of
odds and probabilities. Locker room
gossip has it that the cup will grace
the Gamma Kap livingroom at the
end of the season. We would not be
at all surprised, but still hold out
for Newman Hall's chances. At
least they will give them a good run
for their money.

Game Time

The Myskania-freshman game
proved just once more what a great
drawing card sports events can be.
It is our thesis for the year that
sports are important and should be-
come more a part of general college
life. What we are loking forward to
with great interest is the proposed
Milne vs. Practice Teachers game.
If it does come off, we bet the
Madison Square Garden alone would
be able to do justice to the crowd.

Personalities

The welcome mat is out for Frank
Woodworth, formerly of class of ’45
and the U. S. Navy. Frank was a
mainstay of MAA and we are glad
to see him back.

KD is having a bit of hard luck
in the injury to Sandy's knee, —
and incidentally so is Mary. Sym-
pathy goes to both and the hope
that Sandy will be back on the
court again soon.

Just about the most energetic
fresh to hit Statc~in the athletic
field, that is. is Adrienne Iorio.
Already she has credit in four
sports —— tennis. badminton. hockey
and volley-ball. Nice going. Would
that more people would show as
much enthusiasm. WAA would
benefit materially.

STATE COLLEGE NEW 5, FRIDAY,FEBUARY 9, 1945

Thomas More
Defeats Stokes
In Overtime Lap

This week, due to the fuel short-
age, WAA has been forced to post
pone its schedule of league games.
However, n Monday one of the
scheduled games was able to be
played off. This proved to be fast
moving and exciting contest between
the girls from Stokes Hall and the
Tommis More lassles. From the
very‘first whistle both squads began
a determined fight for final honors.
The contest finally resulted in a
16-16 tie. In the two minute over-
time period Sylvestri broke the
deadlock by tossing up two points
for the Tommy More team leading
her squad to an 18-16 victory.

The new schedule for the WAA
basketball league games is as
follows:

Saturday, February 10

Myskania Warns Frosh

Two freshmen, Dorothy Bird and
Dorothy Causse. have been reported
to Myskania as having broken rival-
ry tradition number seven of Satte
College which states: freshmen shall
not wear any high school insignia,
such as rings, pins, keys, athletic
awards, etc., until Moving-up Day.

Miss Bird has committed three
offenses and will make an apology
in public before the Student Assoc-
iation. This is the second offense
for Miss Causse.

Ping Pong To Start

Betty Rose Hilt, ’47, captain of
Ping Pong has announced taht all
those who wish to participate in
the Ping Pong tournament should
sign up on the WAA bulletin board.
Several people signed up last semes-
ter but during the rennovation of
the bulletin board the old list was
misplaced. All those who are inter-
ested must sign up before next Wed-
nesday. A schedule of the matches
will be posted and the contestants
will be notified about the matches
by student mail.

As soon as the tournament begins,
matches must be played on time,
in order to finish the tourney be-
fore the end of the season.

Bowling League

Loses Top Men

Uncle Sam blew the whistle again
last week and four of MAA's
bowlers Were whisked away. Bob
Sorensen, Cliff Thorne, Bob Horse-
man and Bill Barrington, all fresh-
men, are the ones who have left
the holes in the MAA bowling
teams. The Flashes were hit the
hardest. They lost Thorne and
their captain Sorensen, who was
leading the league with an average
of 154.3. Horseman was a consis-
tent performer for the Whiz Kids,
and Barrington was a mainstay of
the strikers. All four are going
into the navy.

The last match before exams
found Bruce Hansen's Whiz Kids
taking undisputed possession of
first place. They took four games
from Dave Lehman's Thunderbolts
in that team’s first league ap-
pearance. There was some very poor
bowling on both sides. but the Whiz
Kids hung on and won easily. The
caliber of the matches can best
be shown by the high games of the
night.’ Jim Crandell turned in the

Amendments Proposed

When Florence Garfall, '45, Presi-
dent of the Student Association, pre-
sented the motion to the students
at the last assembly, Shirley Pas-
sow, '46, proposed the following
amendment to the motion:

In order that the Student Associa-
tion may retain as niuch control
over the finances and affairs of the
proposed State Cllege Union,
through its representatives, the Stu-
dent Union Board. which will be
Working with the Benevolent Asso-
ciation. I propose that the student
members be elected by the Student
Association; that election be on the
basis of a major office; and that
the students best qualified to fill
these posts be sought.

Also. I propose that one member
of each class from 1945 to the year
the Student Union is constructed, be
elected to the Student Union Board.
It is likely that this board will not
exceed 20 members, if the Student
Union is constructed at the end of
ten years.

Martha Sprenger then proposed
an amendment to the above amend-
ment stated as follows: I propose

will not be heated in the evening
until further notice and all activi-
ties scheduled for this time have
been cancelled. In addition, the
gymnasium and library were closed
the first two days of the week.

Statement to Press

Dr. John M. Sayles, President,
sent a statement to the newspapers
last week in answer to those who
had criticized State College for re-
maining open during the emergency
period when all other schools were
closed.

The statement explained that
exams were in progress all week, and
that the heat was turned off every
day as soon as possible. It said also
that the closing of the school would
have further complicated the trans-
portation problem, for the students
would have to return to their homes
on the already over-crowded rail-
roads.

Dr. Sayles added that our fuel
supply was adequate. and anyone
bearing proper authorization would
be welcome to a share of it.

fessor of fine arts, announces an

The other match of the evening
also ended in a shut-out. Bob Sul-
livan's All-Americans turned on
the heat to take four games from
Bob Sorensen’s Flashes. The bowl-
ing was better in this match than
in the other. The team scores were
higher as were the individual
scores. Weber had the high game
of the night with 188, and Sullivan
had the high total for his team
with 464. Sorensen’s 163 and 436
were the best for his squad.

Nelson Releases
Tentative Plans

For Summer, '45
English, Math Courses

Included In Curriculum

The schedule for the eight-week
accelerated program for summer,
1945, has been announced by Milton
G. Nelson, Dean. This schedule is
quite definite as it stands and will
be subject to almost no change.
Classes will begin on June 25 and
examinations will be held on August
17 and 18, with July 4 a holiday.

Last semester accelerated students
were asked to indicate whether or
not they planned to attend the sum-
mer session. Those who thought
they would offend were sent a tenta-
tive schedule and instructed to mark
the subjects they would take.
Summer Schedule

As a result'of the information col-
lected the present program was
evolved, and it varies only slightly
from the proposed schedule. Dean
Nelson said that students who have
not signed up f'or the summer ses-
sion but decide to attend before it
begins can probably be accomodated.
No fees or other charges are levied
for the accelerated session.
Six—Hour Courses

Each student should register for
one of the following courses:

Ch. l8——Inorganic Chemistry

Ed. 10—Jr. Psychology and Ed.

Eng. 3—Gen. Survey of Eng Lit.

Eng 113—Poetry and Prose of the
Romantic and Victorian Periods.

The above courses will meet Mon-
day through Thursday from 11:10 to
12:30 and 1:10 to 2. and Friday from
11:10 to 12:30. Each course will give
six hours credit.

Nelson NuIIifies 'Rumors;
School To Recess In Spring

The rumor floating around the
halls of State to the effect that
Easter vacation will be eliminated
this year has been “spiked” by
Dr. Milton Nelson, Dean.

Dean Nelson said Wednesday
that present plans call for ad-
herence to the schedule in the
catalog—that is, spring recess
from noon, March 28, to 8:10 AM.
April 9. There is, however, a
possibility of a change in the
dates.

Washington’s Birthday, which
is on Thursday this year, will
not be a holiday. The Dean ex-
plained that the holiday would
be too short to warrant the strain
on the railroads which would
result from students going home
for the long week-end.

The speculation about Easter
vacation was also based on the
transportation problem. and it
was suggested that keeping stu—
dents in classes during the Easter
season would further relieve the
situation.

returns to his ancestral home on the
occasion of the great annual fair.

Scandal and Scheme

In the first act the curtain rises
on a gathering of village gossips,
spreading scandal. Serpolette is
the chief topic of conversation
among the belles of Corneville. She
comes in just in time to turn the
tables on the others, and to change
their Sheers to expressions of rage.
Gaspard. an old miser. wishes to
marry his niece, Germaine, to the
principle magistrate of the district,
The Bailli. This does not. however,
suit Gremaine nor a young fisher-
man named Jean Grenicheux, who
pretends to have saved her from
drowning. To escape the power of
old Gaspard, Germaine takes advan-
lage of the privileges of the fair and
becomes a servant of the Marquis.
Her example is followed by Greni-
cheux and Serpolcttc.

Treasure And Tunes

Supernatural visitors who for a
long time have made the Castle of
Corneville an object of dread appear
in the second act. Henri determines
to find out the real character of
these ghostly appearances and dis-
covers fhnt the old miser had kept
the castle haunted l'o protect his
hidden treasures.

The third act is the grand fete.
Scrpolelfe arrives with seine papers
found in the chateau which she
claims indicate that she is the lost
heiress. The miscr. however, re-
covers his rcuson in lime and shows

Purim Celebration

Hillel has scheduled their Purim
party for Sunday, March 11, at the
Tfircth Israel Synagogue on Part-

Albany are all invited to this party.
Molly Kramer, ’47. and Charlotte
Goldstein, ’48, are chairmen of the
affair, assisted by Irma Rosen, Ruth
Bessel and Rita Shapiro, freshmen.

Purim. which means ‘by lot,’ cele-
brates the time when an ancient
king drew by lot the appointed day
for the slaughter of the Jews. How-
ever. they were saved, and thus the
holiday is celebrated.

Desire Dance

Hillet will hold a ‘suppressed
desu'e‘ dance at the gym on March
17. All are urged to cavort in the
costume habitual to the realization
of their suppressed desire. There will
be cnlcrfnimnent and refreshments;
music will be furnished by a victrola.

Slated To Seek Today

Discussion Will Include
Postwar Racial Aims

Student Christian Association will
present Julius A. Thomas, Director
of the Department of Industrial
Relations in the National Urban
League, as the principal speaker in
this morning's assembly. His topic
for discussion concerns "Social Goals
for Postwar America, a foremost
problem in world events of today.
Eleanor Hayeslip, ’45, President of
SCA. will introduce Mr. Thomas.

Engaged in social work for twenty
years as a staff member of the
Urban League, he has served as
Executive Secretary of local affil-
iates in Atlanta, Georgia; Jackson-
ville, Florida; and Louisville, Ken-
tucky. He was appointed Director
of the Department of Industrial
Relations for the national organiza-
tion in 1943.

Articles on Negro Life

In addition to a varied and suc-
cessful experience in community
organization for social welfare. he
has been closely identified with pro-
gressive interracial programs and
activities throughout the nation. A
frequent contributor to magazines
and neu’spapers. he has written sev-
eral articles on various aspects of
Negro life in America. He is also
a popular speaker and lecturer on
these social and economic problems,
particularly as they affect race re-
lations and the Negro population.
Born In South

Mr. Thomas is well qualified to
stress the Negro problem, having
been born in North Carolina and
having received his education in the
public schools of Charleston, West
Virginia. A graduate of Howard
University. he did additional work
at Columbia University.

Race relations and social problems
are ever increasing in this civiliza-
tion of today and there has been
world-wide discussion of this grow-
ing menace. Mr. Thomas will un-
doubtedly give many new and diver-
sified points.

In lhis same relationship, Forum’s
speaker of last Wednesday who dis-
cussed a particular locality and its
racial prejudice, should be men-
tioned. Mr. Paul de Albuquerque
from RPI. a native of Latin America
stressed such troubles arising in
Brazil alone.

Student Union Passed

With a unanimous vole of the.
student body the finul motion for
setting up u definite Student Union
Plan was pusscd in lusl week's us-
scmbly. curling a long and careful
period of“ rcseurch by the Student

Wiuyull, ‘45. :1 member of the Com-
millcc. clarified the objectionable
cluuscs of the preceding week’s dis-
cussion uud iulroduccd the motion
in its finul l'orm. Jumcs Whylock,
‘47. propole u new amendment
which would give the Student Asso-
ciufloli powcr lo challenge or veto
no net of the Sludcnl Bourd but the
umendnwm was dcfcnlcd in the
resulting vole. The Student Bodv
fcll lhul enough clusllc powers had
ulrcudy been given to Student Asso-
ciulion to enable them to nullify on
not of the Board and that further
amendment. of the motion would
only cripple [he iuiliufivc of the
Bourd ilsclf.
