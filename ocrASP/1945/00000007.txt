There may be some discussmn on settle down to their usual even style

the question of whether the Mys-

kaia-Frosh game belongs on the rallied

sports page. But if TGIF can be
represented—so can Myskania. Ser-
iously, it was a game well worth
watching. The black-robed ones
made a better showing than anyone
thought they would—including Mys-
kania. Smith, Garfall, Now and
Cooper, the “regulars” of the team,
were right in there. Meyers, of the
“conscripted” members was the sur-
prise of the day. Her guarding and
smooth interceptions helped save the
venerable seniors from worse than
a 53-21 defeat. In the freshman
lineup all members distinguished
themselves. By the way, does Tilden
ever miss?

Myskania’s provision of two
stretcher-bearers turned out to be
more grim than anyone intended.

made in an earlier column that
State College students do not receive
adequate medical protection.

Winter Wonderland

For the last month or so we have
been watching the little ones romp
in the snow—skiis and sleds flying
——no cares. Washington Park has
become a miniature Sun Valley, of-
fering all the winter sports. State
students might be able to use the
facilities if they can negotiate a
non-aggression pact with the juve-
niles who are now undisputed mas-
ters of the scene.

Then there was the little boy who
preferred to use the icy sidewalk
for his sleigh-run. We stopped to
give him a lecture on consideration
of the rights of others —— but we
really didn't mind walking in the
road.

About Milne

Last week-end we saw our first
Milne basketball game—but not the
last. Those kids really put on a
good show. One thing that im-
pressed us about the game was
the enthusiasm of the audience.
They were never still. After grow-
ing up on the utter passivity of
State College spectators, it was
quite a shock. There are only two
or three times we can remember
when the Eagles received the vocal
support they deserved.

Yea Lincoln!

the long list of reasons why we
honor Lincoln. His birthday on-

steady form and were unable to
check the strong Baker-McGinnis-
Ropke combination. Guido seemed
to be the mainstay on the Newman
defense while Russo led the offense
with four points. Baker gained scor-
ing honors for the B2. quintet.

A spirited session between Phi
Delt and Sayles resulted in a 30-22
win for the Phi Delts. Both teams
put up a valiant struggle last year
to remain on the list of those chosen
for league championship. Phi Delt
has retained much of its former
strength in the person of Hamilton,
Seymour and Barnhart while Leng-

adds to its powerful offense. Sey-
mour was high scorer for Phi Delt

14 for the losers.

'Lock OI Smokes

Scored By All

— By George Hess —

We decided to disgress from the
field of sports this week and write on
a matter of universal interest. We,
like all other fiends, have been run
ragged trying to find cigarettes.
Time after time we have arrived too
late. “Sorry, Mac. Just sold the last
pack,” has rung in our cars so often
that we are growing just a bit tired
of it.

Rumors, Facts

In the back of our mind was
always a nagging little thought. We
were always trying to figure just
where all the cigarettes were dis-
appearing to. There Were lots of
hints and rumors, but no definite
information. Then Monday night
we saw an item about a new cigar-
ette that is to make its appearance

soon. Quoted in the article, as an
afterthought, were a couple of
figures on current cigarette pro-
duction. '

Terrific Production

We learned that Phillip Morris
produces no less than 33 billion
cigarettes each year, and that Lig-
gett & Meyers lChesterfields) makes
just twice that many. With these
figures to work on we decided that
R. J. Reynolds (Camels) whipped
out 75 billion; American Tobacco
Company (Lucky Strikes), 65 billion;
and P. Lorillard Company (Old
Goldl, 22 billion. This makes a total
of 261 billion popular brand cigar-
ettes produced in this country in
one year. Then we used 130 million
population to determine the number
consumed. If fifty percent of the
people in this country, 65 million,
were to smoke a pack a day for a.
year 23,725,000,000 packs would go
up in smoke.

By dividing 261 billion by 20 we
discovered that only 13.050.000.000
packs were produced. This leaves a
deficit of 10,675,000.000 packs a year
and, seemingly, a solution to the
shortage. But, and here is the hitch,
we haven’t even tried to estimate
the number of lesser known brands
that are produced. There are so
many small sellers on the market
that they must make up the dis-
crepancy between production and
consumption of popular makes. And
another factor is the figure we used
for the smoking public. There are
many men who will never touch a
fag. sticking faithfully to pipe or
cigar.

Got A Hutt, Pal?

The foregoing still leaves us with
the perennial question: WHERE
ARE ALL THE CIGARE'I‘TES?

Students Attend
State Legislature

At the New York State Assembly
open meeting held last Tuesday at
l P.M., at the Capitol, Speaker of
1110 House Ivt-s. in conjunction with
Assemblyman Quinn, introduced an
Anti—Discriminaiion bill. This bill
would set up u five-man commis-
slon to bar discrimination in cm-
ploymcnt in the state by using 1301'-
suasions and penalties, to influence
education and the spirit of
brotherhood. It has us its objec—
tive Lhc concept of freedom from
all racial and religious discrimina-
Lions.

Arguments against the Anti-Dis—
crimination bill lncludc that it
would set up u Gestapo, would on-
courugc block-mail to employers
by members of the racial groups
discriminated against, and would
drivc business out of the state bo-
cuusc New York would be the only
state where this bill would apply
and business men would take their
business clscwhcrc. Those who
'uvor the proposed bill say that
it would not in any way compel
the employer to hire anyone he
doesn't want but that it would
prevent any discrhnlmitlon in hir-
ing bccuusc of men, creed or color.

(,lovcrnor Dewey, Mayor Lu-
Guurdln and Eric Johnson, presi-
dent of the United States Chumbcr
of Conuncrcc, have all spoken in
favor of this bill. Dcwcy endorsed
it saying, "that it will insure equal—
ity of opportunity to all" and “will
place our state in the forefront of
the nation in the handling of this
vital issue."
