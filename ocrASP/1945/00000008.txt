STATE COLLEGE NEWS, FRIDAY, FEBRUARY 13, 194!

Communications
An open letter to the Student Body

Last fall when the class of '48
came to State some of its members
were amazed, and not a little dis-
appointed, to discover that State
had no band. A few of the group
wanted to see our college with a
large active band and so they did
the best they could by forming such
an organization from among these
they knew, their fellow-classmates.
After a long struggle, this group
finally began rehearsing and play-
ing, but this was not really what
the ’48 musicians wanted. Surely,
they were in a band; yet, it wasn’t
a "State College” Band, and that is
what every member hoped to have.

The so-called "Frosh Band” is a
successfully working organization,
and its members feel that it is time
something was done about that for
the college. Therefore, we would
like to invite all musicians from
any class to join us in forming a
“Shire COLLEGE” Band.

Some on, you ’47’ers, '46’ers, and
'45’ers who play instruments, let’s
see State with a band of its own.
Drop a note in the Student Mail
giving your name, instrument, and
when and where we can contact you.

A. .‘ ‘." .'
- - -

Hoping to hear from lots of you,

Marie Agnew ’48
Director, Froah Band.

To the Editor:

Do you have the correct time? We
at State do not. Last year it was
necessary to call to the attention of
the administration the inaccuracy
of the Page Hall clock; now our
plea for correct timepieces includes
all the clocks in every building.

After much ado about being late
for classes, practice teachers at-
tempting to be on time for Milne
classes, or getting back late for
their own, the cause has been dis-
covered. For the benefit of those
who believe what they see, don’t.
After a tabulation it was found that
the library clock is three minutes
slow, the P0. clock is five minutes
behind the times; all the rest are
four minutes fast. These figures are
based on a three days’ comparison
wiht radio time.

Let’s start all over and see if we
can’t do something to get our day
on schedule again.

Tired of being late or early,
Lois Holstein

Men who glared in civilized wrath
at each other all invoked demo-
cracy to bolster their arguments for
or against the Ives-Quinn anti-
discrimination bill, at Tuesday’s
public hearing in the State Assembly
chamber.

More than 200 representatives of
Chambers of Commerce, the Rail-
road Brotherhoods, real estate asso-
ciations (opposed); labor unions,
Jewish, Negro, Catholic and educa-
tional groups (favoring) spoke before
the Ives commission and a packed
Assembly. Since November open
hearings have been conducted on the
measure, and public opinion through-
out the state has been roused to a
high pitch. Before examining the
backstage political scene, a brief
summary of the bill is in order.

A commission appointed by the
governor. with the advice and con-

- sent of the Senate, is proposed. Its

powers and duties will be to estab-
lish local and regional offices to in-
vestigate complaints that discrimin-
ation because of race. creed. color or
nationality prevented a person from
obtaining or keeping a job. Labor
unions (notably the Railroad
Brotherhood, with iron-clad restric-
tions against Negroes> are equally
culpable with employers. The com-
mission will havc power to penalize
defendants convicted of i'lscrimin-
atory practices after a full hearing".
Those protesting a decision have the
right of appeal to the Supreme
Court. Penalties are imprisonment
up to one year, a fine of not more
than $500, or both.

As Assemblyman William Andrch
pointed out in his talk at the. col-
lege Wednesday, this is the latest
and best constructed of several at~
tempts ot eliminate discrimination
in employment. The bill has teeth;
it is irrefutably democratic in its
concept: and it establishes in law
a new American tradition: oppor-
tunity for employment without dis-
crimination shall be a civil right.

Nevertheless. there are valid ob-
jections»~loopholcs which time and
experience alone have corrected on
other social degislation. The much-
iiici'y of the commission is clumsy.
Legislation alone will not extermin-
ate inbrcd, personal prejudice. Op-
ponents stress as their chief argu-
ment that business will suffer
through passage of the law. Job
hunters from all over the country
will flock to New York. Simultan—
cously, employees will quit their jobs,
rather than work with a Jew or a
Negro. And furthermore, business-
men will pack up and inovo to states
where such discrimination (as they
desire, presumably; will remain
legal. Most opponents 'I‘ucsday pre-
faced these contradictory charges
with the insistence, “thc social ob-
jectives of this bill meet with our

 

full approval.
ization opposes
but—-”

One serious bottle-neck, some say,
will be the difficulty of proving dis-
crimination. But this is not the am-
biguity. unfortunately, that a strang.
er might think. Discrimination is
the personnal manage’s “No help
wanted, thanks,” to the Negro phar-
macist who applies for a war plant
job. Discrimination sets the level
of advancement far down the scale
for Jews, Negroes, Catholics and
Orientals, depending on the com-
pany or part of the country con-
cerned. Discrimination barred many
from some labor unions, forcing
would-be unionists to become strike-
bi'eakers, in pro-Pearl Harbor days,
or keeping them out of work in a
closed shop.

In time of economic sterility, with
jobs few and men hungry, discrimin-
ation sets “white Protestant” Amer-
icans against Catholics, Negro and
Jewish Americans. Democracy, as
the attractive Air Corps lieutenant
told me at Tuesday's hearings, be-
comes "an over-rated exaggeration.
Prejudice is fanned to hatred, and
the ersatz, deadly catalyst of dis-
crimination causes race riots, bread
lines—but no cure for the job short-
age. This never CLll‘CS a depression,
but it does give the unemployed
other thing's to think about than the
‘real resaons why there are not
enough jobs for everybody who
wants to work. We refer you to
Nazi Germany. where the scape-goat
technique was perfected to the point
of total war.

The bill does not seek to “legislate
discrimination out of the hearts of
men." It does purport. to guarantee
every citizen the right to work. As
such it will implement the Presi-
dent’s wartime Fair Employment
Practices Commission, which has
the same end but less force. Lack
of prosecution power has balked the
EEPC's efforts most of the time, it
was admitted here this week.

Opposition to the lvcs bil found
voice in the representatives of up—
state New York farming districts
and districts where the Railroad
Brotherhood is strong (such as Mid—
(llciown. whose Assemblyman Vim
Duscr was frank in condemning the
llicnslll'ci. It also was supported by
anti-Dewey Republicans, a condition
which makes for a peculiar almos-
phcre at the Cnpi'ol these days.
liowuy has been steadily antagoniz-
liig a growing number of Republi-
cans. by supporting legislation they
sought to kill, by it disregard foi-
personal sensibilities and by lnjudi-
clous distribution of patronage.
'l‘hcso will all be factors when the
vote on the anti—discrimiiiation bill
is called onday. At preesiit indica-
tions, passage will be by an ovar-
whclming majority.

Of course, our organ-

all discrimination,

It Says Here. .- .

In the February 9 issue of the STATE COLLEGE
NEWS, there appeared a letter to the Editor, signed
by “conscientious objectors,” concerning the pay-
ment of the $20 Student Tax. In this letter, the
“conscientious objectors” stated that the “charges
leveled against them were manifold and grave.”
They implied that the action taken against them
by reading their names in assembly was flimsy,
general and unfair. They further stated that they
did not intend to pay the Student Tax fee because
it is “an omnibus tax, including not only fees for
services which he might receive, but also a contri-
bution to the Student Union, a philanthropic cause
for which he might, or might not want to give."

Our “conscientious objectors" asked if the NEWS
would grant them space to defend themselves since
they were not allowed to speak in assembly. lie-
cause of the nature of the letter, they were granted
the space, even though it carried no signature,
which in itself might have disqualified the letter
since one of the policies of the NEWS is that all
communications must be signed, with signatures
withheld upon request. (See bottom of the page).

Contrary to the implications of the letter, ilic
charges against the negligents were not flimsy,
general and unfair. The defenses they prcscnlcd,
however, were flimsy, general and inaccurate. (in
page 18 of the Freshman Handbook, there is a
clause which reads: "A tax of $20 is assessed and
collected by the student body at the time of
registration. Payment of this tax is mandatory be-
fore the student will be admitted to any classes in
the college." In other words, our "juvciiilc dclin—
quents," as they deign to label themselves. are
granted a privilege for which the rest of us pay $20.

The first item of defense is entirely underslaiul-
able. it is true that some of us have to work our
way through college and can neither afford lhc
money nor the time extra-curricular activities
would require. However, by simply talking’ to lir.
Sziyles or Dean Nelson and explaining the situation,
the student involved could be excused from paying
the fee for financial reasons. The second item is
weak. They complain that some of them received
but one notice. just one comment on that point
exactly how many notices does one require before
he catches on?

And the third item . . . "Whatever the Spokes—
man of Student Union may believe, whatever ini-
pression he may have given, the Student Tax is
not a legal obligation upon State Students. It is a
voluntary payment." We refer you going, to pugc
IS—Frosli handbook. As for the philanthropic
known as the Student Union, we had our choice lusl
May of $6 or an investment in the first great
studcnt-sponsorcd undertaking that has hit Stale
College in many years. Did all of our delinquents
vote against it? We are inclined to believe that they
against it? We tll'C inclined to believe that they
didn't for even some of them harbored gi'cai hopes
for a Student l.'nioii. But if they (lid ull voic
against it last May, we would like to point out lllill
by passing the motion by such a majority, we are
favoring the majority of the students which is one
of the foremost principles of the “democracy upon
which we pride ourselves,” mentioned in the letter.

State Aid, Teachers

The American people have always
considered education on important
part of the growth of the good Cltlf
urn, and New York Slate is one of
the lenders in this field. In keep-
ing with this progressive policy, llic
State Legislature is now considering
proposals which would considerably
niodcrnlzc and enlarge the State
Aid method of equalizing education.

The answer to this brain-twister
is State Aid-«u term which is fain-
lliar to rural pupils and almost un-
known to residents of large cities.
In simple terms, State Aid is a plan
which cnublcs the State to collect
money through indirect taxes mid
return it to communities on the
basis of their needs. This plnii
shifts the tax burden to those who
can afford to carry it. for the in-
direct levies are on luxury items,
automobiles. beverages and the like,
and not on property.

Each county collects these tuxcs
and turns them over to the State
for redistributimi. A few of the
larger counties pay out more than
they receive, and the rest get more
back in State Aid than they con-
tribute in taxes. The money is up-

Wolf In Racoonis Clothing .
Will Wear Sealskin Hai

“But a wolf in racoon's cloth-
ing!"

“Why not? The sealskin hat
will neutralize the effect. . ."

And so it was argued as the
Soph banquet crept closer and
closer. The day finally arrived
when the four TGIF skit writers
came to an agreement. Red Rid-
ing Hood's wolf would be at-
tired in racoon and sealskin.
But from whence would these
semi-precious props come?

Accusing eyes maliciously lit
on one who prefers to remain
anonymous. "See Dr. Jones and
Dean Nelson tomorrow,” came
the order. Hat in hand, the lowly
one went home to nightmare.

The day dawned damp and
gloomy. Visions of expulsion and
disgrace beset the unfortunate
one. Jones was a pushover. One
racoon gained.

“Good morning, Dean Nelson."
The story has a happy ending.
Frank Woodworth, alias the wolf,
will be clad tonight.

Williams Wins

Freshman Election

Alice Williams is the new vice-

now in the Navy.

Aid for each such unit is $1,900.
This is not, howover. the final
amount the county will receive.
The number of units, multiplied by
llli‘. grant pcl' llllll, is applied to a
formula involving the valuation of
llic county; thus the poorer a dis-
trict the more State Aid it reccivcs.

Education is not static, mid neith-
('1‘ are the processes which cause it
to function. At the present time
the Legislature here in Albany is
considering several measures dc-
sigm-d to lake the "kinks" out of
State Aid mid equalize education
to an even greater degree.

The most important measure is
the Milmoe-Young state aid bill,
which is the Educational Conference
Board proposal for the revision of
the state aid formula based on the
attendance of pupils and the cost

of transportation. The bill further
states that any district maintain-
ing adult classes, night school and
other part-time classes will receive
the same amount of aid as it would
for regular classes in high school.
One very important point is that
in the future the basis for aid shall
be the average of the average daily
attendance for the three years im-
mediately preceding.

’l‘hc Mllmoc—Young salary bill in-
creases lhc annual minimum of
teachers in union free school dis—
tricts and fixes the minimum for
teachers in common school districts
at $1,500. A second Milmoe-Youiig
bill increases the salaries of touch—
ers in citities of at least 50,000 and
not more than 150,000 to a mini-
mum ol‘ $1,600 in secondary schools.

A third important part of the leg-
islative program is the extension of
tenure to non-tenure areas. It is
expected that these bills will be
acted on late this month, and
should be of interest to all students
here at State. These measures, if
passed, will do much to equalize
and improve education in the entire
state.

Debate To Decide Dolly's Dulles

With the melting of ice, bright
sunshine and the coming of Spring,
a young man’s (or to be contem-
porary, a young woman’s) fancy
turns to Spring cleaning of school
property, just helping Campus Com-
mission. wide open spaces and, of
course, Love. At this time, however,
at State there is no love lost be-
tWeen the Soph and frosh classes,
they are running neck in neck, (not
necking) competing for the remain-
i..g rivalry points.

At present, the Sophomore class
is officially ahead with a score of
ii to 41-; points. Since neither class
has yet been successful in seizing
the rival class‘ banner, five points
for this contest is still pending un-
til Moving-up Day when the victor
will be announced.

The Sophs won 4%» points on
Campus Day, 31%.: for the games and
1 for the skit; 2% for the sing; and
2 for hockey, I for archery. and 1
101' football. The frosh gained 1 for
ping-pong and 31.1.» for Campus Day.

The next event in rivalry which
will be next Friday in Assembly is
the hurtle of words between the
rival classes on the poignant reso-
lution: "The freshmen should be
free from homework." True to the
spirit of the green, the Soph squad
has taken the negative and will try
to prove without doubt to the dai-
fodils “that you come to college to
gain knowledge—by doing home-
work."

Perhaps the daffies aren’t so daf-
fy, because they have undertaken to
convince everyone that fresh do not
need homework—lucky people! Sad
for the classes who have gone be-
fore and worked, if '48 should suc-
ceed in their endeavor.

For this battle of words, the vic-
tor class will receive 2‘9 precious
rivalry points. Quoting a little
gremlin, “We expect to chuckle up
our sleeve as grim frosh struggle
vainly to prove why they, as priv-
ileged characters, should not have
homework in an institution like
State." Dr. Louis C. Jones, Assistant
