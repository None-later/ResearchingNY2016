STATE COLLEGE NEWS, FRIDAY, FEBUARY 23, 1945

Dynamiters, Gamma Kap . Sophs
BZ, Still In League Lead

Win First
Game By 25-23

The freshmen are going to get
another chance Monday afternoon.
They will tackle the Sophomores in
the second of the rivalry basketball
series. The round-robin is sched-
uled for two out of three. The Sophs
have a one game edge in the short
series. The second game will be
played Monday afternoon at 4:30,
and the third game, if necessary,
will be played off Wednesday.

The first game that was played
a week ago today ended in a close
victory for the Sophs. Both teams
were somewhat handicapped be-
cause it was the first game that
they had played as a unit this
year.

Sophs Are Good

The game was fast and rough,
but quite clean for a game
where feeling was running so high.
The game was marred by very few
fculs. The frosh looked very good
at times, even spectacular, but the
speed and drive of the Sophs proved
too much for their guards. Several
times the frosh had chances to
hold the Sophs down, but the Sophs
went on to score.

The game itself was close through-
out, with the lead changing hands
several times. The frosh had the
better of the going in the first quar—
ter, leading at the whistle 514.
During the second stanza Gloria
Russo got hot for the Sophs and
the score at half time was 16-12 in
favor of '47. , ’

The third quarter was mostly 485
and they caught up 19-19. Tildcn
tossed in three field goals to tally
six of the points herself
Sophs Take Lead

In the last quarter the Sophs
grabbed the lead which they never
lost. The game ended with the Sophs
in possession of the game and

threatening to score again.

Bowling Rivalry
Will Begin Soon

Jim Brophy, ’48, announces that
the rivalry bowling match will be
a two game affair with the win-
ner garnering 3 rivalry points. The
contest is scheduled for the 16th
of this month but if the teams split
in the games, it will be necessary
to play the deciding match at a.
future date.

The freshmen are at a definite
disadvantage due to the loss of
three of their top men to the Navy
—Bob Horsman, Cliff Thorne. and
Bob Sorenson. The latter led the
league in average, and all three
will be greatly missed.

Probable Teams

Unless there is an unknown
bowler who will be discovered in
the tryouts of competing classes,
relying on the M.A.A. tournanment
scores the probable line ups will be:

Sophomores:
1. Jim Whytock
2. Cal Zippen
3. George Hess
4 Hal Weber
Al Balk

5
c
1 Bruce Hansen
2. Harold Vaughn
3 Jake Farley
4 Bill Baldwin
5. Bill Barrington.
Something New Has Been Added
This is the first time that bowl-
ing has ever been a part of the
competition for Rivalry points.
With the interest shown in the
sport this year it was decided to
add i'. to the list of Rivalry events.
further incentive for the move
was filling in the place of pushball
in the competition.

Students Spoil Hick’s Plan;
Fail To Carry Out Point

Dale Carnegie may have hit
upon a good thing. but he can’t
sip the Five Point Program for
influencing marks introduced by
Dr. Hicks at the Soph Banquet.
it might be well to explain that
high on his list was this gem:

“Always come to class late,
slam the door, say ‘Good Morn-
ing‘ to the teacher, have an
idiotic excuse ready, and be sure
to drop your books. This helps
the teacher to learn your name."

It wasn't a complete shock,
therefore, when two “innocents”
waltzcd into Dr. Hicks’ 10:10
class Tuesday at 10:11“: and very
casually slammed the door.
"Good morning, Dr. Hicks." they
purred in unison, as they banged
their way to their seats.

Their excuse was suggestive of
the very one offered at the ban-
quet and there was just a hint of
a self-satisfied smile as the two
settled back in their seats.

They were a trifle chargrined.
however. when Dr. Hicks re-
minded thcm, “You forgot to
drop your books! "
