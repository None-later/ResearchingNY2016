Ebbmg Time
This is 1945. March. This is a time which a
few years ago seemed in the hopeful future—the

post-war future. And now this post-war future is
still a dream, a dream to which we all cling.

When people attach their minds to a hope, either
consciously or unconsciously, they can endure the
strain to a certain point and then there is the ebb,
the relaxing. This feeling is a kind of a fatigue,
something of a conglamoration of despair and in-
difference. This is even more tragic when one
realizes that he musn’t relent.

Even in normal times, this state of mind is
evident, but in war-time its consequences are more
drastic.

Every year about March, this ebbing occurs.
This year, signs are already visible. And yet we
must force ourselves to hold on to that kind of
spirit which was seen in embryonic form in a group
of freshmen who formed a band. The nucleus is
there, within sight.

As the soldiers keep to their pace, so in miniature
comparison, must we. But then, another factor
enters the picture-—the encouraging war news. In
this instance, the reverse procedure is necessary,
for we must clamp down our spirits from rising too
high, which inevitably leads to complacency.

We get excited when only so many planes were
lost, and then we stop and remember that there
were men in those planes. And we realize that we
are living in a paradoxical state of mind. But
nowhere, are there people priveleged to live in easy
thought.

Our service flag bears thirteen gold stars. More
than thirteen lives have been affected by the death
of these men. They died for certain democratic
principles which we have the nerve to disregard in
our small-time college life.

In 1941, the present Senior class entered
State and called itself “The Crimson Tide.“ Its
cry was victory. How far these people were from
knowing that within a year or so, another kind of
Crimson Tide would be flowing over all the earth.

This is March. It’s time for the charac-
teristic reflux. This letting-up leads to apathy in
college. But let’s take it on a world-wide scale.
As young hopefuls four years ago gave eager shrieks
for the surge of the "Crimson Tide," may the
Crimson Tide of today be ebbed!

These Honored Dead

At the junior Class banquet last week, Dr. jones
suggested that some building be dedicated to the
memory of the men from State College who have
died in this war. He believed that it should be a
permanent useful building which generations of
State College students will be able to use and which
will stand as an ever-potent memorial to the State
College men who will not come back.

At the time, Dr. Jones suggested that the new
gymnasium provided for in the post-war plans he
considered as a possibility. However, another idea
took root in this when a member of the junior
class suggested the Student Union.

As it stands now, the Student Union is one of the
most vital assignments ever assumed by the stu-
dents of State College, or the student body of any
college. If plans continue as already established,
the fruits of this enterprise will be a significant
step in the progress of the College. It. is most fit-
ting that a building crcctcd as a culmination of
student initiative, dreams, and efforts of the finest
calibre be a symbol also of the efforts of men who
fought ami died in the present world strife.

A dedication is no easy thing. An inanimate
object can never even attempt to replace the lives
of people. Static objects do not even approach the
expression of our deepest and inner-most thoughts.
(iold—inscripled plaques, momnnents» they're sta-
tic, lifeless. l’eopic look at them, momentarily im-
pressed.

liut here is something we are creating with our
own hands, our own minds. Here is something that
will be life, that will be filled with people. The
Student Union is a construction conceived and
built by students, financially independent of the
State of New York.

It will be a building that is useful, that will go
on making people better because its purpose is the
betterment of people.

As the Student Union is our goal, let the memory
of these men be our inspiration, our dedication.

 

STATE COLLEGE NEWS, FRIDAY, MARCH 9, 1945

 

Series 1 Answered 

To the Editor:

Last week a column by Kippy
Marsh appeared in the Nws. This
letter has been written to clear up
a few points.

In this column Kippy criticized
several so-called organizations or
cliques. Among these was the TGIF,
a social club whose members are
predominately Sophomores. Kippy’s
criticism was based on her belief
that the TGIF divided the Sopho-
more class against itself, and im-
plied that the club could become a
political force.

In reply to the foregoing charges,
we would like to present the follow-
ing facts:

1. TGIF started on November 3 as
an escape mechanism from the
strain of classes; its only purpose
was a weekly meeting where we
could relax and be thankful that
the next day was Saturday.

2. In our enthusiasm we purchased
our trademarks, the green caps. We
were proud of our club and wanted
everybody to know about it.

3. This enthusiasm, by its own
momentum, carried over into school
and class functions. By working as
a club, we gradually became known
as a clique throughout the school.

This is to inform everyone who is
interested that the TGIF has no
political aspirations. We have sev-
eral members who hold various of-
fices; obtained through their own
efforts and not pushed or sup-
ported by TGIF.

We agree with Kippy that dif-
ferentiating one small group from
the whole by means of a symbol
is a bad practice. and one which
causes dissention: therefore we will
no longer wear our caps in school.

We will do our best to keep our
enthusiains confined to the limits
of our meeting place.

Sincerely.
TGIF's

 

 

Dear Editor:

My blood is not boiling and I’m
not hot under the collar. In fact
I feel quite cairn. cool and dejected
about the article by Kippy Marsh
last week.

May I land I think you'll let me),
congratulate her for writing and the
Nizws for printing it. The article
showed thought as well as being
honest and sincere. Also it inacie me
think. and some people claim that's
a difficult job to do.

Now to become serious. I ineli-
iioned Kippy's article as being hon-
est and sincere and I hope this let-
ter will be taken in the same light.

She mentioned (among others)
three groups of which I am a mem—
ber. This seems to be pretty bad
for I am. or in danger of becoming
a “damning influence" or a “me-
nace.” They are "Western Hall
gang," "Zorks" and Kappa Delta. As
far as I know. no deliberate discrim—
ination has been done in any of

When people find they have some-
thing in common, they like to get
together and talk, or meet and en-
joy each other's company. Is this
harmful discrimination?

They may not offer anything con-
structive except to themselves, but
bridge-clubs, sport’s organizations or
church organizations offer nothing
constructive unless you have an in-
terest in them.

Zorks and TGIF wear “discrim-
inating marks." I don’t think they
do it for that reason. It merely
shOWS what group those people be-
long to. I don’t think any one will
dispute the fact that TGIF definite-
ly has the soph class at heart.

The Zorks are new but they are
definitely for the Fresh class. Well,
are either of those two groups any
less loyal to their respective class
than the non-members? I think not.

I wonder if the student body
would favor doing away with sorori-
ty pins be cause they are discrim-
inating marks? This would be stu-
pid and ridiculus. Well, what about
Myskanla then?

Myskania—or is this subject dy-
namite? As I understand it, Mys-
kanla is a judicial body. It is made
up of people who have proven their
leadership and ability. There are
people who believe they don’t need
robes to “discriminate themselves.”

I say, they are not discrimination
unless you make it so. I look upon
those robes with respect. much as
lawyers respect the robes of the Sn-
preme Court, whose members cer-
tainly are leaders enough not to
need robes to prove that fact.

In my viewpoint. Myskania obtains
more respect and dignity with these
robes than they could without and
that’s why I think they should con-
tinue wearing them.

Perhaps they could sit in the
audience as members of the Student
Association when they are not no-
cessary for the assembly program.

Well Nuws, this is a problem
every student in this College should
think about and you deserve lots of
credit for bringing it to light.

Dear Miss Marsh:

We read with deepest concern
your column in last week’s Nicws.

If. by running the class. you mean
officers fulfilling their obligations
and class members supporting them,
indeed we. Sophomores of Newman
Hall have been doing just that. and
we‘re proud of it. We came out last
year, we‘re coming out this year,
and we‘ll keep coming out as long
as we're at State.

Any member of '47 can do the
stunt).

IN MEMORIAM ,

This Week, State College’s service flag is being taken
down so that three more gold stars may be added to
the eleven that are already patterned on its surface.
Perhaps this is the time for a sentimental speech or
emotional flow of the pen. but there isn’t any play
on words that could ever come near the feeling that
one gets deep down inside upon learning that some-
one he knew no longer exists in any other form than
just a gold star embroidered onto a piece of cloth.
So perhaps just listing the names of those declared
killed in action would be more fitting: Frances Lip-
pold, ’33, Al Trehanon. ’38, Major Alfred Dedicke, '18.
Vibert. Fryer, Graduate Student. Sgt. William G.
Scholz, Graduate Student, Major Bernard Gaft‘ncy,
'39, S/Sgt. AI Parker, ’40, Sgt. Robert Gleason, ’44.
Donald W. Eddy, ’34, Lt. (jg) James R. Maloney, '41,
S/Sgt. Glenn llaushaultcr, ’40. Pvt. Harold E. Lind.
’45, Li. Will Valley, ’40, Lt. Frederick F. Wohlstcin. The
State College Honor Roll says, “They gave their lives
in honor of their country.” Maybe we can make these
more than just gold stars on a service flag by
keeping them in our hearts and not forgetting for a
single moment why it was that they gave their lives.
and by vowing to do just a little—01' perhaps a lot-—
more than we have been doing to help get this war
over faster. Let us remember the gold stars—and let
us pray for the blue ones.

Timorous Maiden Reveals
Midwinter Night’s Dream

Do you dream of your profes-
sor? Yo you ﬂinch at his scru-
tinizing gaze?

Dr. Henrickson after a barrage
of questioning by inquisitive
Sophs bashfully admitted that he
enjoyed a bit of mixed social life.
Upon this divulgence a timid
Soph female volunteered the
taboo information that she had
dreamed of Dr. Henrickson the
night before. Pressed further,
she told of the night of nights
encompassing the movies and
“the long way home.” At the
end of this jaunt the fair maiden
bestowed a bit of osculatory af-
fection upon the prof of the
hour.

The secret confession revealed,
the “pink” lady resumed silence.
Dr. I-Ienrickson, regained his well-
known composure after a hard
struggle with tdare we say)
blushes. Needless to say class
resumed.

Lesson of the Day: The sup-
pressed desirel.

Press Bureau

Present Stall

Vera Kozak, ’45, director of Press
Bureau, announces that new mem-
bers from the Junior and Sopho-
more classes will be elected to the
Board in the near future. Further
plans were also formulated by the
Bureau to foster publicity in the
city papers.

"There has been a great deal of
confusion among the students over
omission of press notices in the Al-
bany and hometown newspapers,”
according to Miss Kozak. This was
mainly the result of banding in an-
nouncements to Press Bureau for
too late to subinlt to the Albany
press. All notices sent to local
paper are used at the convenience
of the newspaper and thus in larger
papers often can not be. printed.
News Deadline

given to members of Press Bureau
one week preceding the event.
Heads of organizations and classes
are urged to cooperate in enforcing
this time element. Individuals
should also check to make certain

by the Bureau.

There are still Seniors who have
not turned in their three agency
pictures anci students are urged to
do so immediately if they wish to
derive publicity beneﬁt.

of the committee: and that these
members could be replaced by the
class by those who would be in-
terested and capable. While most
of the revision work would be done
in committee, the group should have
the right to call for the help of
any other campus group. Weinberg
stated that the committee should
be formed of people outside Student
Council because the council is the
executive body of the college and
has no legislative powers. He also
feels that the large committee would
be nearer to the student body.

Council Refutcs Weinberg

.In an attempt to defeat the mo~
tion of Weinberg, Cecile Goldberger.
“to. representing Student Council,
wrll propose the following scheme
for setting up a constitution revi-
sion committee:

The entire committee would con-
sist of seven members; our mem-
bers from Student Council, consist-
ing of one representative of each
class, and three outside of council
members to be appointed by Stu-
dent. Council. These members could
be anyone from the student body.
Student Council provided that the
outside member be appointed by
Student Council because it feels
that the council will be able to ap-
po 11‘. the most interested persons
who would do the most work on
the committee.

Other provisions are that the
chairman should be elected by the
commission itself, that five members,
or 2/3. must approve all changes.
that the commission should meet
once a week. report to Student
Council at least once a month. re—
port the changes in the constitution
to each class and take a vote on

Council States Reasons

The reasons for taking the ma-
jority of the committee from the
Student Council are that it has an
active interest in student affairs.
was elected by the student body to
act. in an advisory capacity to the
legislative body of students, it al-
ready exists as a functioning body.
the total representation of the col-
lege groups is already in the coun-
c11. and that although Student
Council is an executive body. it also
has the power to bring up amend-
ments. This revision is considered
by Student Council as an amend-
ment. because amending means
that one item may be stricken out.
and another retained. Student
Council will also ask help of the
groups on campus.

Student Council feels that the
plan proposed by Weinberg is too
idealistic and too unwieldly to be
effective.

A splash of green, a. lightning
streak of yellow, and rivalry goes
on. Colors clash, competition rages,
temporary victory flaunts its flam-
ing banner.

Greedy, grasping, green-eyed
gremlins gruesomer grapple for il-
lusive victory while daring, dainty
Idomes dash dauntlessly into the
ray.

Heaven is scorned and Hades ls
glorified as the ’47 Helllons ruth-
lessly advance their last feeble at-
tempts to pile up the rivalry points.
Their score mounts slowly as their
inflated ego rises by leaps and
bounds.

O fatal, self-destructive vanity!

The invincible frosh fighters unite.
fight and plot with minute precision
the disgraceful downfall of their
oppressed opponents. They neither
fear. flee nor fancy the strong-arm,
do or die, and ill-fated methods
of their traditional enemy.

Like battle-front generals, they
mapped their road to victory. Ral-
lying their cheering sections, boost-
ing their bond-buying, massing their
famed talents for seat in heaven
and a super show at State. the vic-
tory-seeking daffs have gained the
roving school spot-light.

The gracious gift of ceding the
Rivalry Debate to the loquacious
Sophs (or Gusty Gremlins) was
made by the generous freshmen who
advocate the ancient proverb, “ac-
tions speak louder than words," and
practice what they preach.

Having shown their chief prowess
and closest competition in active
sports, the yellow youngsters vi-
ciously await the approaching bowl-
ing and swimming meets, on which
hinges the fate of '48. 'Tis rumored
that one of the illustrious frosh fel-
lows modestly flaunt the moniker,
lhc Icing of ten plus. Nor is it
without rhyme or reason that the
land-docked loafers call the daffies
the fishiest class at State.

Come late spring. come the Bon-
ner Hunt. come tough situation for
the sad-sacked Sophs! Theirs will
be the inournful garb of sack cloth
and ashes, as with eyes finally free
from .Utopian illusions and victori-
ous Visions. they yield to their su-
periors. Being engulfed in a tidal
wave of maize, they will forfeit
their "daffy" dreams as the on-
ru'shmg golden horde sweeps into
triumph.

The Die ls Cast, and while. like
proverbial gophers, the gremlins
seek peaceful concealment, the daffs
will flourish in enveloping victory.
