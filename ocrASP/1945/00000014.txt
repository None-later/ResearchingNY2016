STATE COLLEGE NEWS, FRIDAY, MARCH 16, 1945

Communications - - -

To the Editor:

Last week I sat in Assembly and
watched Democracy at work. Yes.
I saw Democracy in action but I
feel this action was in the wrong
direction and the following facts
should have been explained. I know
it's too late but I must get this off
my chest.

Last March a spirit of Democracy
also ran through State College.
Some wished to throw out Myskania
while others wished to form a good
Student Council. The Student As-
sociation saw that the ousting of
Myskania was wrong and they start-
ed work on a bigger and better Stu-
dent Council. So after many long
and exciting bosiness meetings a
new child was born. A Student
Council of 23 instead of the usual
'7 with many new powers. (These
powers were not taken from Myska-
nia since Myskania never had them).

This September our Infant start-
ed to live. We learn in Ed. 10 that
an infant has lots to learn and
makes plenty of mistakes in the be-
ginning. So what did the Student
Association do its own child. who
would have been one year old on
March 1'7. We told it, of course in
baby talk, that you are very in-
efficient, you have made loads of
mistakes. and you are made up of
people who are not leaders. but
people who won a popularity eon-
test. (At least I know I voted for
7 people and if I voted for popular--
ity. I’ll take the blame of being a
lousy and uninterested voter). We
continued and said “although you
are a representative group of us. we
feel you aren't good enough to re-
vise our Constitution. It's a big job
and we're going to let 11 from Stu-

dent Association do this enormous
job.” (Yes. I know some of the in-
tellegent members of Student Coun-
cil might get on the committee).

Some say we didn’t mean it that
way. But when you think it over,
I feel you will have to admit we
took away the big chance our in-
fant had to advance and start a
bigger and better life. After all,
Student Council is our representa-
tive and I would like to know “Why
in h——— can’t we learn to trust
somebody???"

I feel we have taken our infant
and cut its stomach out and just
permitted its heart to beat slowly.
Why let it suffer at all? Why not
kill it and be humane?

I think it would be nice of Stu-
dent Association to appropriate
money for a tombstone which could
be placed on top of the Student
Council desk in the Commons with
the following epitaph inscribed:

Student Council
Born — March 1'7. 1944
Died —— March 10. 1945
It was started in hope of
bettering Democracy. but
killed when it was begin-
ning to see the light.
Sincerely,
Philip Lashinsky. ’47.

To Whom It May Concern:

A letter was sent to the editor
this week which was not signed.
Since it is not our policy to publish
letters which have no signatures.
and since we should like to publish
this letter as well as furnish an
answer, we request that the author
submit his name by Tuesday.

Sincerely,
The Editor.

 

 

In view of the intensity with which
its protagonists view Palestine, and
the concern of President Roosevelt
and Winston Churchill, it came as
a mild shock this week to hear a
usually informed person ask. “But
is there a Palestine problem 7"

There not only is a Palestine
problem but it is the key to many
of the strange developments in the
Middle East recently. Those exotic
stories of President Roosevelt's
tete-a-tete at Bitter Lake with King
Ibn Sand of Saudi Arabia—he of
the hundreds of sheep. the burnoos-
ed. grinning aides and the dignity
of '70 years—portend more than the
belated declarations of war which
followed. Shortly after Egypt's
King Farouk visited the President
aboard his destroyer. Egypt declar-
ed war on the Axis. Extraordinary
that a conference can achieve what
Nazi invasion of Egypt failed to do
nearly three years ago. As German
defeat crystallizes. why do these
nations suddenly become belliger~
ent? Because. we read. they were
told their admission to the San
Francisco conference would cost
them a war declaration. What kind
of inter-allied conference will en-
sue from this premise of bribery.
applied to South America as well
as the Middle East, we will not
venture. We prefer to keep a few
hopes simmering.

Yet that segment of Palestine—
the Zionist Jews—which opened war
on the Axis when England did, must
plead to be heard in San Francisco.
Chaim Welzman. the Zionist leader
and brilliant English chemist whose
research in the last war moved
England to reward him with the
Balfour Declaration. may not even
be allowed to speak. Loyalty to the
Allies seems irrelevant, judging
from Palestine. Jewish fighting
brigades, young women in uniform
(the PATS) have carried the Zion-
ist l'lag through North Africa. Italy
and France. Their Arab neighbors.
tmlni’luenccd. not only ignored but
in Egypt and Iraq sought to sabot-
age the Allies. Not until 1941 and
1942, when England cracked down
on fifth columnists in those coun-
tries, and war began to veer toward
the Allies, did the Arabs soften
their pro-Axis rumbling.

Arab politicians are good poker
players. By staying out of the last
war and dangling oil concessions
before the British. their leader,

Hussein. secured transfer of nearly
1,000,000 square miles of territory
from Turkish to Arab domination.
No other group gained so much
from the war—and at so little cost.
Britain then issued the Balfour Dec—
laration. promising to further the
establishment of the Jewish Na-
tional Home in Palestine. On this
basis she obtained the League of
Nations Mandate for Palestine. She
now felt her economic dominance
secure; the lifeline to India and
Asia. termed the most important
factor of empire by the London
Times." was thoroughly protected
by English bases in friendly terri-
tory; huge profits were envisioned
from oil, shipping. export trade and
side lines. Whatever else has hap-
pened in Palestine. this policy suc-
ceeded. Nazi propagandists threat-
ened it seriously, but that threat is
gone. American competition for oil
flared up last year. but a deal seems
to be in progress. Everybody is hap-
py but the Jews and Arabs who
want to live in Palestine.

This column could never do jus-
tice to the 25-year history of Arab
nationalism and Efl'endi (land-
owners) vs. Zionism. Two gigantic
facts stand out: 1. Zionism has de-
veloped Palestine into the most
modern. healthful and progressive
country in the Middle East. Since
1939. 400 new factories have been
established and war production
(madrupled. The British Army. chief
purchaser of these supplies, now
owes Palestine about 15400000900.
2. Arab nationalism today has the
blessing and encouragement of
Great Britain, whose policy in. Pul—
estine is undeniably anti—Zionist.
This nationalism has as a common
aim among several disunited. jeal-
ous Arab rulers the destruction of
the Jewish National Home.

Protesting that the Jews seek to
dispossess the Arab natives of Pa]-
estine, Arabs scoff at figures show-
ing that the Arab population of
Palestine has doubled since Zionist
reconstruction begun. “Propaganda!”
they reply, to statistics on the high-
er economic and health status of
Arabs in Palestine compared to
Arabs in the other vast territories
under Arab control. The JeWs.
meanwhile, are as desperate as a
group could be which has poured
"blood, sweat and tears" into both
the rebuilding of a country and the
attempt to rescue millions of fel-
iowmen from the Nazis.

Revise And Prevent . . .

In spite of the fact that a resolution was passed
in Assembly last Friday which set up a commission
for the purpose of revising the Constitution, the
question is far from settled. There are two theses
which have arisen to complicate the situation. They
are l.—-That those present at the Assembly and
voting were forced by the nature of the Student
Council resolution to vote for or against the Coun-
cil in making their decision; and 2.—that Student
Council has been handed a direct insult by the
defeat of their amendment.

In regard to Thesis I, Student Council in present-
ing their amendment stated that a "vote for our
plan is a vote of approval for the work we have
done.” They were prompted in this statement by
the fact that they believed the powers given them
last Spring were elastic enough to include the
power of revision of the Constitution. Mr. Wein-
berg‘s motion implied the Council did not have
that power. Student Council thus took the op-
portunity to bring the question before Student
Association.

In regard to Thesis II, we are attempting the
impossible by trying to analyse the temper of
Student Association. Uncontrollable factors such
as time, speakers and attitudes influence voting.
We believe all these entered into the voting Fri-
day. By this we do not mean to say the students
did not know for what they were voting. However,
it would seem that the students did not consider
their vote as for or against the Council.

Such a controversy as this should never have
occurred. Student Council is not certain of its
powers and Student Association is not sure of the
powers it wishes Student Council to have. While
the work of the Council is not seriously impaired
by last Friday’s vote, the Council has been handed
a set-back. The question of Student Council power
15 becoming more urgent since the formation of
the working. interested body we now have. It is
therefore necessary that some decision be reached
as to what the Council will and will not be em-
powered to do. This should certainly be one of the
most important considerations in the revision of
the Constitution.

Not Yet . ..

State College seems to have been hit by a wave
of over-optimism. WAC has gone out whole-
heartedly to expand war activities at the college.
but there has been a very definite and verv notice-
able slackening of interest and enthusiasm among
the students this year. The Red Cross drive is not
going over with one tenth of the enthusiasm it
should.

The Stamp Day. sponsored once a month. has
been steadily falling off. Do we think that. be-
causc the war seems a little brighter for us. the
boys will no longer need guns and looks and um-
munition?

Today is the filth Stamp liav. WAC is singing
an Irish show in the (.‘onunons'at noon. If evcrv
student bought a ten cent stamp, it would help 
lot to boost our War Activities and it needs
boosting. .

Powell Eludes Inquiring Reporters New

STATE COLLEGE NEWS, FRIDAY, MARCH 16, 1945

Mindy Didn't Take The Hint

—-- By MINDY

Dick Powell is a movie star with
a philosophy on life. He doesn’t
like people who think the self is
important. Since he is no hypo-
crite. Mr. Powell is neither con-
ceited nor affected in any manner.
He wanted to give us that inter~
view all the time—ho can’t help it
if he has a manager and three body-
guards who are the shoving type—

When first We arrived at the
theater. Mr. Powell was just being
ushered out to a radio broadcast.
So, instead of an interview. we got
an autograph, along with a sincere
.apology. Perhaps the apology
shouldn't have been quite so con-
vincing—we took him up on it and
raced his big black limousine to
Albany's radio station—only to find
the door there locked.

After realizing there was no fire
escape we could climb up to get into
the station. our gaze came to rest
upon Mr. Powell's chauffeur who
was sitting nonchalontly outside.
patiently awaiting his employer.
Here was our intermediary! A fer-
vent Won’t You Please Give Us An
Interview plea was inscribed upon a
sheet of copy paper and thrust into
the front seat with a honeyed re-
quest to the chauffeur to make sure
Mr. Powell received it after the

 

Debate Try-outs
Will Determine
Council Members

Jane Rooth. '45. president of De-
bate Council announces a special
try-out meeting today at 3:30 PM.
in Room 31. This meeting is pri-
marily designed to interest fresh-
men. although. upper classmen are
also invited to compete. Monday
there is an open meeting at 3:30
P.M.. Room 31 during which a de-
bate between Rita Shapiro. Ruth
Bessel. freshmen. and members of
the Council will be conducted. The
topic will be “Federal Aid to Edu-
cation.”

The council feels thai a decided
lack of interest in the forensic field
has been exhibited by the freshmen.
In order to remedy this situation
these try-outs will be conducted.
The Council also feels that a more
skilled rivalry debate could be fos-
tered if the freshmen were trained
this year. From the group trying
out will be chosen two council mem-
bers and a varsity squad that will
be eligible for membership on coun-
cil.

Debate Council is also interested
in organizing a varsity squad repre-
sentative ol‘ the student body and
apart from the Council. This squad
will conduct inter-collegiate and
infra-collegiate debates. Plans are
also underway for inter-class debates
other than rivalry debates.

A debate with Skidmore is sched—
uled for March 26 at Skidmore. The
topic will be "Federal Aid to Edu-
cation" with Jeanette Sonic. ’47, and
Marianne Davis, ‘46, representing
State.

The next contest will be March 28
at Wells College. Aurora. New York
on the same topic. June lioolh. and
Dorothy Faulk. Seniors. will speak.

broadcast.

Suddenly the door to the radio
station opened. The three body-
guards emerged. The manager
emerged. Mr. Powell emerged. The
crowd began pushing and we were
sulmwrged. With much arm-wav-
ing and a cry to our crooner-actor
friend of “Remember the Interview!
We'll meet you at the Palace!" we
took to our heels and ran back to
this aforementioned theater.

We arrived before Mr. Powell and
breezed backstage with an explana-
tion. "We have an appointment," to
th open—mouthed doorman, and a
tolerant reply of. “The press. you
know." in answer to the madding
crowd’s protests of “Some noive,
some crust!"

We got our interview. After his
last appearance. Mr. Powell spoke
to us man-to-man fashion and told
us everything we wanted to know
(well. he answered all our questions
anyhow. . .i

As for the Facts of his Life, he
comes from Arkansas. has been
singing ever since he was five years
old. made his first movie in 1932.—
and the rest is cinema history. He
really sends his audience with his
latest screen interpretation—~that of
a hard—boiled detective in his new
movie chiller. "Murder. My Sweet."

Mr. Powell is even better looking
off-screen than on. and he thrilled
us in answer to one of our more
personal questions by saying. "Why.
Ladies. I like all women . . ." He
was handsome. polite. and full of
personality—in short. a cavalier!

For Discussions

Meeting Places Named
For Various Groups

A complete reorganization of
Newman Club will be underway at
all future meetings. Small groups
will replace the former general
meeting to some extent, by conven-
ing twice a month for one hour to
discuss foremost religious. political.
and social problems. According to
Marguerite Bostwick. ’45, President
of Newman Club, the new organiza-
tion gives an opportunity for more
informal and practical discussion.
and affords an opportunity for every
student to select a convenient time
and place for such club meetings.

Group llouse Discussions

The subject of the discussion
groups will be determined by the
participants, and topics may extend
for several weeks or new items can
be introduced at each meeting. A
chairman and vice-chairman for all
meetings will be elected and Rev-
erend William Cahill will assist dis—
cussions and act as advisor at all
meetings.

In addition groups will participate
in a general social meeting once a
month which will be devoted ex-
clusively to entertainment. dancing
and refreshments. Harps' Riot will
take the place of the social meeting
for the month of March and on
April 19. the first general meeting
under the new plan will be spon-
sored. Except for a short business
discussion the affair will be entire-
ly for pleasure.

Program For Groups

The following program has been
outlined for such discussion groups
including the time, place and group
houses for which the particular
meeting place is intended. Thomas
More House and Newman Hall have
already adapted this new plan at
their meetings this past week.

First and third Mondays of each
month—3 :BO—Lounge— Commuters,
Sayles. Pierce and the Annex.

Every Tuesday —- 6:30—Thomas
More House. Psi Gamma and Gain-
ma Kappa sororities.

Second and fourth Thursdays—
6:30—Newman Hall and Wren Hall.

First and third Tlmrsdays-—6:30—-—
Chi Sigma Sorority House.

Rules Not Iron- Clad

In regard to other group houses
such as Nelson. Morcland, Farrell.
and Stokes. the individual houses
themselves may decide to which
group they wish to belong. It is
suggested by Miss Bostwick that
they attend the Newman Hall or
school meetings; however, it is en—
tirely up to the members. The sug-
gestions for other group houses are
not iron—clad and if one group can-
not make the suggested house. they
may join any other assembly which
is convenient. to them.

It is up to every member to make
these new groups an integral part of
their Newman Club activities. The
meetings last only one hour and
many prominent and important
questions will be discussed.

No longer need we toss fitfully
upon our self-made beds. No longer
sigh languorously for the unattain-
able. Mental pictures need not diz-
zin confuse our muddled brains.
It's here! Like the dawn—Hillel's
suppressed desire dance will unsur-
reptiously creep into the gym, to-
morrow night 8:30 PM. to 12 PM.

Delving into a unique field of en-
tertainment. the brains of Hillel
came up with the 'suppressed desire'
idea. Many people harbor deep with-
in their breasts a hidden flame or
wish. Saturday night’s their golden
opportunity. No form will be strange
to the naked eye as cigarette and
match march silently down the gym
stairs. Hints of a fan dancer are
dampant. No hurricanes allowed!

Cruising around State We find
that the elite and bourgeois alike
cherish hidden desires—examples—
‘to be a tree.’ ‘to be a bat women.’
‘Gypsy Rose Lee," ‘to be a man
hater.’ These few printable desires
will appeal. to say naught of the
others.

Supervising the 'parade of the soul
dreams' will be Shirley Gross. ’47.
herself. long a master of the sup-
pressed desire. Rumor has it that
the entertainment for the eve is a
burlesque entitled ‘Hillel's A Pop-
pin.’ The Horah. traditional Pa-
lestrinian dance will be taught to

all present by several masters of the
terpsichore—guaranteed to tax the
waistline and take a heavy toll of
shoe leather. Hillel also has in
their possession the epic-speech
which Dr. Allan Hicks delivered at
the Soph banquet. Just how they
intend to utilize this masterpiece of
‘scholastic' writing is a secret even
to the author.

The gym will be bedecked with
the suppressed desires of the faculty
in effigy. In the east wing the typi-
cal suppressed desire of a school
teacher will hang—effigy of Errol
Flynn.

Only inhibition connected with
said affair is the admission price of
25 cents. Tickets may be purchased
from members of Hillel or at the
well guarded door on the fitful
night.

Committees for the affair include:
Shirley Gross, general chairman;
Publicity. Sylvia Jediken, ’47, Betty
Diamond. ’46; Entertainment, Pris-
cilla Welnstein. '47; Tickets, Leila
Sontz, Blanche Parker. Juniors;
Refreshments. Muriel Rosen. Shirley
Taylor. Sophomores, Rita Shapiro,
'48; Decorations. Leah Tlschler. Lau-
ra Kuhn. Seniors. Marilyn Warshaw,
'47; Clean-up, Leanord Koblenz, ’48.

So dress up or dress down in your
desire.
