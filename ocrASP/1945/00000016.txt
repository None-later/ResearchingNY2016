The Patriot . . .

There are none so blind as they who will not
see . . .

The war doesn’t mean a thing.

It’s March, 1945 now and a simple matter of
subtraction brings to light the dull fact that for
four years and three months we have been battling
a seemingly inexhaustible foe. Four years and
three months. Seems like a long time, doesn’t it?
But it hasn’t been - not for us here at State. Only
for the 130,000,000 people who have worked and
prayed and given. We have not given.

This week the blood bank of the Albany County
Chapter of the American Red Cross stated that
in the future it would take a State College group
no larger than ten. The reason is simple, alto-
gether too simple. We have signed up to give
blood, appointments have been made With the Red
Cross, and we have not gone. In one outstanding
instance, nine out of twenty five ‘fvolunteers
showed tip. Besides shirking an obligation and
fainting the college name, by this act we prevented
others from donating their blood. Others who were
willing and anxious to give one pint of life to a.
wounded fighting man.

Nobly raising money for the war effort, we
subscribe to the various programs sponsored by
War Activities Council. Every Big Eight goes
“over the top.” Each State Fair has a record-
breaking attendance. Sophs and frosh alike btiy
War Stamps in rivalry competition. The coffers
are overflowing and success is ours. Btit let‘s face
it. Would one tenth of this money have been
raised if a prize or an entertaining evening had not
been in store for the patriot? A glance at the
number of students who have taken on the “dirty
work” —— knitting, canvassing for the O.U’.A.,
rolling bandages, and working as Nurses’ Aides in
the hospitals - might well be the fact that
proves the theory.

Granted there are those of us who are physically
unable to give blooc who have not the time to
canvass or roll bandages, but in a student body of
1000, there is no excuse for the ridiculously small
minority who volunteer their services. It all boils
down to this. State is ignoring an all-out war pro-
ject and living within its own narrow little con-
fines where Big Eights and War Stamps are amuse-
ments and potential rivalry points, rather than
contributing factors to future victory. The war is
a thing far away from our busy world. It means
nothing.

Four years, three months and torn limbs. We
have not returned the blood that has been and
is still being given for us.

For Posterin . . .

Traditions have always played an integral part
in the life of State College students. liar back in
1917 there grew up a body whose main purpose was
to keep intact these very cherished and revered
traditions.

However for the past two years strong antagonis-
tic feeling has arisen against these time-homn'ed
customs. More radical students see nothing but
nonsense and sham, others are indifferent—~—pagcan-
try and ideals mean little to them. We don't deny
that State is indulging in a bit of sentimentalism.
But what keeps alive these hearts, these feelings,
these very buildings. if it isn't these small excur-
sions into the field of sentimentality and rever-
once.

The war does this to State. It turns students‘
heads to the concrete and realistic, everything must
be on a practical and efficiency basis. Meanwhile
spirit soars out from freshman hearts, activity be-
comes more and more meaningless, and college is
but an empty building in which cold, hard pro-
gress marches on while ever-lingering memories fade
into oblivion.

Let us tiling to our few remaining cus-
toms, preserve thcm for posterity so that our sons
and daughters may come to State and feel the
sacred reverence of an immortal institution, living
with beliefs to be passed down eternally. That is
true college loyalty, and it was built up by revered
traditions. The whole system of Nazi propaganda
came as a result of the fact that Hitler destroyed
his people’s tribal customs and ideals.

Yes, for you State we feel intangible onalty~~~~
a loyalty fostered in our early years by seemingly,
silly, nonsensical traditions. These traditions, how-
ever, proved they were far from insignificant for
it is through them, dear State, that we toward
youwthe mouldcr of our Fate—“cherish, love,
always.”

FRIDAY, MARCH 23, 1945

Point Of Information

By SUNNA COOPER

The fluttering of the NEWS, half-
hearted attendance at Assemblies,
rapid passage of legislation, the
usual emotion, a pinch of reason—
that’s what it takes to be a Student
Association in session. any old Stu-
dent Association.

Careful scrutiny will reveal that
it is as easy to type the people in
our Student Association as it is to
type blood. For instance, there are
three main categories into which
you can shelve them.

A.—-The one who would as soon
devote two business meetings
to hashing out a problem.

B.—-The one who drags his body
to assemblies but wants to get
things over with and out at
the first possible moment.

C.—The thrid group of individuals
prefers their assemblies at
the Boul.

However. even if the newspapers
were not distributed until 12 noon,
or even if there were 100% attend-
ance in this Utopian assembly tra-
la. we would still not necsesarily
have a good Student Association.

This is because human beings
with a minimum of either 13 or 15
hours of studies are not the sole
factor. Otu' Student Association is
comprised of organizations as well.
There is this constant interplay
between council and group. Every
other factor might be conducive to
a smooth-working Association. but
if the people are ignorant of the
way their councils work. all is fu-
tile. It is almost as incongruous
as trying to wade across a river
which is 12 feet deep.

This series of articles is being
written to enlighten the student
body on the inner-workings of the
various organizations. It is fitting
this week to start with an organiza-
tion which we all come in contact
with. which we all have an indirect
say in, and which we all probably
know the least about—Student
Council.

Up until a year ago. Student
Council consisted of seven people——

 

The President, Vice-President, and
Secretary of Student Association,
and the four class presidents. This
was the so-called executive branch
of the student government. How-
ever, the student body felt that
Student Council should be made
more representative and in that
way, the organization would also be
strengthened. Therefore, last year’s
Student Association voted to have
four representatives from each class
in addition to the above mentioned.
This enlarged the Council to twenty-
three members.

If the duties of Student Council
are followed to the letter, allowing
little leeway in interpretation. Stu—
dent Council is actually a passive
organization, and its powers are as
follows:

They arrange the assembly pro-
grams, makes sure that the Direc-
tory is published; charter all boards,
committees, et cetera receiving sup-
port f‘rom the Association through
the budget; regulate and supervise
interclass rivalry; and direct four
specific social activities of the col-
lege: Moving-up Day, Campus Day,
Freshman Reception. and Activities
Day. Student Council also has the
capacity to act as an advisory board
to Student Association. and they
formulate and submit the budget for
approval.

Student Council meets every Wed-
nesday night unless otherwise ar-
ranged for by the President. The
meetings are open to all students;
however. a very small percentage
takes advantage of this opportunity.
More outside interest was shown in
the affairs of Student Council
when they volunteered to work on
the Student Union. However. even
then the number of students at-
tending just because of interest was
negligible.

The students should realize that
they are welcome at the Student
Council meetings. Their interest in
their college government, it seems,
is an indication of the part they
will play as a citizen!

Say "Chapultepec" to a Mexican,
and the reaction would be almost as
violent as saying “Pearl Harbor" to
an American. Until several days
ago. that place in Mexico symboliz-

ed the martyrdom of the six Boy

rom Chapultepec Castle rather
than submit to the American in-
vaders In 1847. The choice of Chap-

By MINDY WARSHAW

One day last week. I was sitting lackadaisically in
the PO reading everybody else’s notes on the board
and breathing blissfully of the smoke laden air.

The lull was interrupted by a loud, eager voice.
“Pile in, fellows." I heard vaguely. “We’re here!”

At first I saw a sea of blue and thought the Navy
was dropping anchor. Then the khaki uniforms of the
Army filed in in a seemingly endless procession. They
were coming in so fast, I could hardly keep track of
the number. Then I realized what was happening.

“’47!” I screamed. “Welcome home!”

“Not much time," they said. “We just stopped in
for a look. We're out on an important mission!” Then
they looked up at the clock. “Come on, gang;" they
sighed, “we can’t stay.” They left with slow dejected
steps, hating to leave the old Alma Mater.

I jumped up and on tiptoe, I followed.

After a bit of riding the billows. the mast was
lowered as the jeep rolled up onto the sands of some

tropical shores name of which turned out to be Ima
Dedjap Isle.

The boys got out. I remained seated upon my perch.

Suddenly I saw a frightened-looking yellow face
peering out at me from atop a cocoanut tree.

“Okay,” he grinned weakly at me. “I sullendcr.
Solly, no rough stuff, please."

‘Suddenly another yellow face popped out from be-
hind a neighboring tree. “Hey. Hari.” he called, “we
no sullender. Remember what Empelor says, ‘I chop
you up in hundled pieces and eat with salt and
pepper if you sullender to Yankees.”

“Okay,” said the first Jap, shivering at the thought.
“Cannot give Honalable Empelor indigestion. I
fight!”

’47 rolled up its sleeve.

Joe Francello climbed up the nearest tree and
grabbed one Jap by the locks. making with a knife
as if to scalp him. Being by now a eonnaisseur of this
art, Francello made a chopping motion so realistic
that the Jap fell dead of fright and tumbled out of
the tree before any act of violence actually occurred.

AI Beninati then climbed tip the same tree. At last
he could put to use the diving motions taught him at
the New York Pier. With one leap. he left the
branches of the tree and dived down on a poor

Prologue

Lo, many a tale has been writ

Of the spirited Sophomore fame,
Of the greatest hero and wit—
The mighty Greinwulf, by name.

Descended from Heaven to Earth

In all his celestial glory.

He stripped of their power. and
mirth

Blue and gold, in battle gory.

Part I
(Greinwulf and the Blue Devil,)

Like a yearling he entered frosh
camp

Awed and yet fearless he stood,

A full head above all he did tower,

To fight the Blue Devil he would.

In his first battle he fell

By signing an unholy pact.

For black-gowned glamour he sought
Because of the knowledge he lacked.

Seeking the Blue Devil’s banner.
Courageously, he held his own,

But thirteen serpents seized him.
Shearing hair, as he struggled alone.

Up from this fray he did rise.

Defending his lock by word.

To part. with his hair he said
“never”

And won this debate absurd.

On the athletic field he starred.

Outstanding in basketball and
hockey.

His spirits soared to the skies

And even higher—at Ockie's.

It was time for Greinwulf to show

His talent. on State's hallowed stage.

“Heaven can wait." said he to the
Devil,

As he gave his Big 10 in Page.

But his day of final glory,

The memorable fifth of May.

He gained that valorous title—
A Sophomore Supreme on this day.
Bedecked in garb of green

He chanted his war song bold:
“I'm the spirit of '47

Who will keep alive traditions old."

Part [I
lGl'CTIllUlle among the Daffy-
Demons)

Time passed for our warrior bold
And more wisdom he had acquired.
Then a new foe took up his stance
By brother Blue Devil inspired.

Daffy Demon, all yellow and ugly,
Enveloped in sulphurous flame.
Dared approach our datuitless hero.
The mighty Greinwulf by name.

At first he received the foe kindly

In his lofty green haven at Page.

But. the Demon turned on him
brutally

And Greinwulf showed force in his
rage.

“Encroacli not on my dwelling!

Take off that ring of gold!

Beware. of powerful Greinwulf

Who guards the citadel old!

FltESlIMEN TO SEE MOVIES

There will be a freshman orien-
tation meeting in Room 20, Richard-
son, Monday at 3:30 PM. Two ino-
tioii pictures, ’l‘omorrows’ Teachers.
the State College film. and Combat

ture of American bombers over

From black cave he beckoned tlig—T‘o-Sliakespeai'd—lie then turned

Demon
On that fateful Activities Day.
And stripped him of silver and
honor
In a most ingenious way.

In a region both dark and obscure
The Demon hid his banner,

But Greinwulf quickly spied it—
And retrieved it in bloody manner.
As Campus Day dawned fair,
Royal homage Grem did pay

To the Queen of Grace and Beauty,
With the skit that won the day.

Heavenly music resounded

From our warrior's lips on the day,
When he excelled the Yellow Demon
In spirited song and lai.

Club; Formulate
Future Activities

Students To Correspond
With Foreign Countries

Several departmental clubs will
undertake new projects in the next
few weeks.

The Spanish, French. and Ger-
man organizations are sponsoring a
drive whereby students of foreign
languages may correspond with
people in foreign countries. This
drive was officially set up by the
Youth Committee of the Interna-
tional Youth Organization.

Those interested in corresponding
with French and German speaking
people should contact Constance
Titterington, ’45. president of
French Club, while Josephine Va-
lenle, ’45. president of Pan Amigos,
will take care of the Spanish cor-
respondents.

Forum has planned a movie on
"Swedish Cooperatives" for its
meeting in April. Along with the
movie Nonia Vimmerstedt, '47, will
introduce further comments on
Sweden. This program was set up
to correlate the work of social study
classes with that; discussed in Forum.

Rosario Trusso, ’45. president of
Forum also announced that Shirley
PQSSOW, '46. has recently been elect.-
ed to Forum Board.

 

We Toast The Sophomores - - Best In Beauty, Brains And Wit

“Sophomores? Why they're the
most intelligent. best—looking, and
best-behaved class I've seen in
years.“ Thus spoke Dr. John M.
Suyles on the Class of '47.

Having heard such a sweeping
statement from the President of
State College. our inquiring report-
cr was encouraged to look further
in search of more comments on her
favorite class.

The first stop was across the hall
of. Dean Nelson's office. where the
Dean was phoning his wife about
attending the woek—cnd's big ovmit.
The Soph Big it? Well. what else?

Our reporter grew anxious as the
Dean hesitated. but. their fours were
dispelled when she was told that
the Sophomores were so sell-stifli—
clcnt and independent that Dean
Nelson never secs any. “I'm lone-
some for them," quotli he.

Drying her tears, our loyal 47'er
slipped down the bull to the office
of the Dean of Women. Miss Stokes'
remarks servod to increase our re-
porter's confidence.

"Your class has enthusiasm and
perseverence with which you carry
out any exti'a-eiirricului' project."

Overwhelmed at the sngacity of
the administrative officers, this
honorable Gremlin felt the need of
a rest~ so she went to class.

After an envlgorating session with
Miss Futtercr. she discovered (with
the usual ’47 fast come-back) her
former stability. Miss Futteror
uddcd her bit by recounting her ex-
periences with said class, "the most
courteous, polite group of students
over ussciilbled In one class.” She
especially noted the manner in
which their banquet was conducted.

’l‘hroughout the remainder of the
day, other tidbits were collected,
from the activity offices in the
Commons to the faculty offices in
Richardson. Some of the quotes
follow.

Dr. Hicks:

“1 was particularly impressed
with the pep and spirit of this ex-
traordinary class. One evidence of
this was the Soph banquet which

had the largest and most spirited
attendance in years."

Dr. Kenncy:

“I have always enjoyed teaching
Sophomores, and have found in the
Class of ‘47 enthusiasm. loyalty,
and professional interest which nu-
gurs well for the teaching profes-
sion."

Florence Garfull:

"The class of '47. without a doubt.
has some of the best potential
leaders of the school."

All of this our faithful Sophomore
could take in her stride, but when
a freshman, Aim May by name,
stated, "Sophomores are so smart.
they don’t have to study for mid-
semestcrs." she had had her quota
of shocks. The “inquiring one" is
now In retirement, gathering energy

to burst forth at Soph Big 8 t0-
morrow.

  

Vivien Nielsen, Kay Hagerty, Mary

And wrote an Ozark play
To swell War Council’s funds
And hasten Victory Day.

A sumptuous feast was given
Like banquet was never seen,
Landing the glories of Greinwulf
In his loyal fight for the green.

He will meet his greatest challenge

With a triumph of the stage

In glittering “Highlights and Foot-
lights"

Tomorrow night, in Page.

Epilogue
So should ’47 give praise
To their Gremwulf’s venturous deeds
Who fights with green banner on

high
And in all endeavors succeeds!

 

Dandelions Or Buttercups.a
No Question With Jones

Many a profound question has
been debated in the classrooms
of State. but none will ever ap-
proach the level of the contro-
versy that was waged recently in
Dr. Jones Folklore class.

The subject of Child Lore was
under discussion. and Dr. Jones
explained that youngsters have
many rituals which they per-
form. For example, he said,
there is the practice of holding
a dandelion under your chin to
see if you like butter. The stu-
dents exchanged puzzled glances,
and finally a few brave souls
ventured to say, “Buttercups. not
dandelions."

Dr. Jones frowned, leaned
across the desk. and phrased
emphatically the one work,
“Dandelions.” The class straight-
ened as one man and roared back
“Buttercups.” After a few sec~
onds of stunned silence. every-
one, including Dr. Jones. col-
lapsed with laughter.

Debate Council
Plans Discussion;
Radio Broadcast

Jane Rooth, ’45, president of De-
bate Council has announced that
State will participate in its first
radio debate in three years. The

discussion on “Federal Aid To Edu-

cation" will be broadcast over sta-
tion WMBO in Auburn on Tuesday
at 3:30. The round table discussion
will be held with Wells College. Ger-
hart Weinberg, ’47, and Dorothy
Folk, ’45, will represent State.

The order of speeches will begin
with the Wells College speaker dis-
cussing the need for equalization of
educational opportunities. Citing
such examples as the influence of
racial prejudice and unequal econo-
mic states, the Wells speaker will
enlarge upon the need for the solu-
tion of the problem of unequal edu-
cation. Following the first Wells
speaker, Gerhart Weinberg will out-
line the means by which education
