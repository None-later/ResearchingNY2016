downed“ them ’21-13 in one of the
most surprising] upsets of the sea-
son. Seymour's handling of the ball
was the despair of the BZ sextet.
Making all but two of Phi Delt's
points. she made basket after bas-
ket and the half found the score,
15-3. In the last half the BZ for-
wards tried vainly to stem the Phi
Delt assault and added five more
points to their score but Seymour
undaunted dropped in six more be-
fore the final whistle blew. The
final result was for Phi Delt, 21-13.
This decisive victory left Gamma
Kappa the only undefeated team on
campus with BZ and Newman
sharing second honors with one de-
feat each.

It looked as if Gamma Kappa
was going to be the victim of the
second surprise attack of the even-
ing when the Stokes squad played
them a close contest. Regularly a
guard, Mahoney played forward in
Boyington's absence and made three
of Stokes' seven points in the first
half. The second half opened with
the score 10-7 in favor of Gamma
Kap and the Quail Street squad
was determined to make it a more
decisive victory. Young led her
team with five baskets and Gamma
Kappa emerged victorious with the
final score, 24-9.

Wednesday night’s games started
out quite uneventfully with the Dy-
namiters bowing to the pOWerful
BZ quintet to the tune of 26-4. The
Dynamiters tried hard, but they
were checked before they could get
underway. Baker led the BZ offen-
sive by tossing in 12 points and
Herllhy chalked up 4 for the Dy-
namiters. It was a hard-fought
game all the way, but BZ held a
steady edge.

The Gamma Kap-Newman ball
game was perhaps the most excit-
ing game to be played on the court
so far this season. It was a close
game all the way, and both teams
put everything they had into the
game. Not even the final whistle
gave any indication of the superi-
ority of either team. The score was
18-18. A three-minute overtime
was decided upon, and once again
the battle began. Young tossed in
four more points for Gamma Kap
bringing her total score up to 15.
Newman failed to score during the
overtime. Cooper led the losers by
tossing in 12 points for Newman.
Maggie was kept down by Cheney
who is one of the best guards this
season. The loss of Russo is also
believed to have affected the close
clicking Newman combination. Hon-
orable mention goes to Mary Straub
of Newman. and to Louise Winters
of Gamma Kap. Both played a
splendid game and were invaluable
in recovering and passing the ball
to their teammates.

 

    
 

   
 
    
  

  

The defeat of the Newmanites puts
Gamma Rap on top of the league
with only one game left to challenge
their lead. If 32. should win over
Gamma Kap Tuesday night, the two
teams will be tied for first place.
However. a Gamma Kap win will
establish their unrivaled suprem-
acy, and will mean for them an
undefeated season. This should
prove to be, the best game of the
season. andwitA would like to see
all the fans out to cheer for their
avorlte teams. All evidence points
a an evening of excitement. and a
chance to see some of the best bas-
kctball players at State in action.

deciding Newman’s place in the big

Rivalry SWIm

The rivalry swimming meet,
which proved to be a popular inno-
vation on the rivalry sports sched-
ule last year, will again make an
appearance on the WAA program.
The meet is slated to be held on
next Monday at 3:30 at the Public
Bath‘No. 3. Two and a half rivalry
points will be awarded to the class
whose contestants are victorious in
three of the five events.

Program

It has been announced that the
program of events will consist of a
speed relay between two members
from each of the rival classes, a
straight race and two novelty races,
one of which will require that the
participants swim the length of the
pool while reading the State College
News and the other that they jump
into the water with their clothes on,
undress and hand all their clothing
to the referee. The first person to
be out of the pool with their clothes
will be the winner.

Although the Class of ’47 was de-
feated in last year’s contest, the
outcome seems to be pretty hopeful
for them this year. Many of their
participants are now experienced
swimmers and alt-round sport de-
mons. Jane Mills, ’47, although a
beginner in last year’s’ meet, dis-
played a great deal of aquatic
prowess in a “neck and neck” race
with ’46's powerful Groden. This
year she will undoubtedly star for
the Gremlins. Jean Davidson and
Jinny Day also appear on the list
of hopefuls and should add plenty
of strength to the Soph team.

Soph Loss

The biggest disadvantage which
the Gremlins will have to face is
the loss of their mainstay, Russo.
At last year's meet Russo came
through with flying colors. However,
due to a sprained back, Russo has
been compelled to drop all sports
for a while.

Kay Booth. Janet Inglehart and
Connie Lesler are some of the other
Sophs who will take part in the
contests.

Fresh Team.

Very little has been said about
the fresh squad. but perhaps there
are a few dark horses in store for
us. We find that Tilden‘s name ap-
pears on the fresh line-up and that
should prove to be a deciding factor
for the fresh. Fedler and Osborne
also show great promise. 0n the
whole very few predictions can be
made at this stage.

Have you heard about the
blessed event? WAA and the

Well. it's expected around Fri-

As yes. Camp Johnston, the
heavenly haven of escapists from
college toll and drudgery. There
the girls get a chance to have
complete relaxation. Not a care
in the world! All they have to do
is chop their own wood. do dishes
three times a day. sleep on nice,
soft. rustic planks, and carrying
on the good old WAA tradition
of participation in at least thir-
teen sports a day. There's plenty
of running water for all. Just
pray fervently every night for
rain, hold a pull under the caves,
and the water runs right in]

Of course, the girls never mind

A 
.  lt‘}  Siena--
Set Fer Sunday

— is, stress and woonwoa'rn —

With vigor' stored from a pro-
longed vacation, and with vitality
brought forth by the unseasonable
weather, the men of State College
have been unlimbering their creaky

muscles in the ancient game of.

softball. The dorm field has been
the scene of their spring training
efforts. This has been no easy task
because spring training has long
been the most gruelling of all work-
outs. It is even rougher than foot-
ball because the kinks of the winter
must be worked out‘ of their ten-
dons.

Even Charley Horses

It is even tougher for the men of
State because of the curtailed win-
ter sports program. Basketball was
outlawed and bowling was the only
thing open from an athletic stand-
point. It must also be considered
that now with spring apparent that
the statesmen have other extra-
curricular activities to demand
their time and efforts.

For the past week the boys have
been diligently practicing all phases
of the game in preparation for the
first home game on Sunday, April
15th. Their worthy opponents will
be the Siena Gaels and they show
promise of bringing a strong team
to State. The statesmen are confi-
dent that they can put ten men on
the field who will endeavor to carry
State's banner to a triumphant
start in the softball season. The
team boasts some heavy hitters and
a fine array of defensive talent.
Johnnie Bolles and Hank Farley
have showed up good in batting
practice and Jim Miner and Jim
Brophy handle the ball well in the
field. Bob Sullivan, captain and
manager, has not yet determined
the starting .lineup but it is pretty
certain that the following men will
see action in Sunday's game: Hal
Webber, Jim Miner, Bob Sullivan,
Jim Broth. Hank Farley, John
Bolles, Phil Lashinsky, Sparky
Vaughn, Bill Barrington, Bill Mal-
lery, Gene McCarthy, your by-liner,
and that's about all.

Free Admission

These stalwarts represent the
greater proportion of the male pop-
ulation of State. They have turned
out in such droves to prove that
they are still as good as anyone. If
they are willing to put forth the
effort to play a stiff seven innings,
the least the girls could do is to
come out in droves to cheer the
boys on. In the past State's ath-
letic efforts have been rather poorly

 

This is the time'for all good
Staters to come to the aid .of a
varsity basketball team for next
year. If the student body really
wants one, will support it—beth
financially and with moral back-
ing—there can be a team repre-
senting State .in intercollegiate
circles. Impossible? No, there is
already a movement under way
to form a team and arrange a
schedule.

A great deal has been missing
from college life with the ab-
sence of a team to root for. It
has been recognized that ath-
letlcs play an important part in
creating a spirit and lifting the
morale of any group. Anyone who
knew State before the war agrees
that something has been lacking
since varsity basketball was dis-
continued.

State students can have a team
next year if they show the in-
terest and the enthusiasm NOW!

 

 

 

Ping Pong Contests
Approaching Finals

The WAA Ping Pong tournament

will soon be in the semi-final
stages. Eileen Shoup’s smashing
victory over Tommy Raymond

brings her to the table to contend
with Ray Weiss in the semi-final
matches. There is still one match
left in the second round to be play-
ed between Helen Bushnell and
Helen Lengyel. The winners of the
Shoup-Weiss and Bushnell-Lengyel
frames will vie for the Ping Pong
championship.

Betty Rose Hilt, ’47, captain of
Ping Pong, announces that all we-
men interested in receiving credit
for Ping Pong should play all their
required hours this week. All credit
will be turned in next week. Credit
will be given after three hours of
playing in the Commons and seven
hours of outside playing.

Many of the people in the tourna-
ment have not bothered to obtain
the other hours necessary. It is
suggested that they do so since
credit in one sport enables mem-
bers to vote in the WAA election of
officers.

If possible. play-offs will be held
Monday. The time for these
matches will be posted today on
the WAA bulletin board.

By Joan Hylind

Surprised to ﬁnd us over on this
side of the page? It iSn't May ﬁrst;
we decided to move a little early.
For a wild moment, considered mov-
ing to the sixth colum, but gave up
that idea.
How We Know

Signs of Springs seen since the
return to Albany—girls playing soft-
ball on the Page Hall ﬁeld, rowboats
on the lake, little boys who should be
in school out in the rowboats, a mar-
ble on a desk in the P.O., classes on
the lawn, nominations in today’s as-'
sembly.

Concerning the above-mentioned

softball—prospects look good for an

active season. Before the season of-
ficially began, kids were out practic—
ing and just generally having a good
time. Interest in softball at State
has been steadily growing in recent
years. All that’s needed now it seems
is the cooperation of the weather
man—a very unpredictable fellow in
Albany circles.

Ancient History New

It’s all over but the shouting in
the basketball league. ‘Phi Delt’s de-
feat of BZ was the major upset of
the saeson. But then, that’s nothing
for the Phi Delt gals. Last year they
spioled the record of the unbeaten
KD team thereby knotting the
league all up into a four way tie for
ﬁrst place. The resulting play-off
made basketball history.

Now, with a tear in our eye, we
report the defeat of Newman Hall
by Gamma Kap. You did a swell
job though, kids and have justified
all our faith in you. We do not
mean to minimize the efforts of
Gamma Kap——they have a superb
team. Their passwork and plays are
worked down to a science that has
not been seen on a State court in
many a year.

This bang-up ﬁnish of the league
is reminiscent of last year's struggle.
Anyone who comes to the Gamma
Kap-BZ tiff is bound to come away
knowing that they have witnessed
some excellent basketball.

Deadline for WAA Credits

WAA would like to remind every-
one w.th outside credit in a winter
or mid-winter sport that they must
give their names to the sports cap-
tain by next Friday. Credits must

‘Assembly Will Open

 

With Campaign Speeches

Crandell, Shore, Sullivan
Nominees For President

To underscore the speeches of the
nominees for Student Association
offices in today’s assembly, the
News has secured statements of the
platforms of the various candidates
for President and Vice-:President.
James Crandell, Helen Shure. and
Robert Sullivan, Juniors, are the
nominees for President of Student
Association.

Crandell

In his statement to the Newa,
James Crandell stated: “Abraham
Lincoln once said: ‘A man who
makes campaign premises is
as worthless as his promises.’
We, as fellow students, have come to
know one another too well to place
our combined integrities in the bal-
ance by insisting upon childish pro-
mises. We might better discuss our
combined responsibilities for next
year and that necessitates a 100%
interest and attendance at Student
Assembly to handle, 1. New Constitu-
tion, 2. Firmly guide Student Union
Plans. I am independent — expect
no favors—but rather a fair admin-
istration.

Shure

Helen Shure’s platform states:
“In response to the request which
you sent me, I submit the following
as principles of student government
which I endorse: .

Carrying out the decisions of the
majority, and protecting the interests
of the minority.

Encouraging participations by the
many rather than delegation to the
few.

Striving to insure and protect a
democratic form of student govern-
ment.”

Sullivan

In his platform statement, Robert
Sullivan says: “The platform I am
propOSing in my candidacy for Pres-
ident of the Student Association is
a three point program dealing with
1. Student Council, 2. Assemblies, 3.
State College’s position among the
other colleges of the States. It is
my opinion that in the past Stu-
dent Council has only warily used
the few powers, granted to it under
the Constitution. The plan I shall
present in my campaign speech will
call for a powerful executive coun-
cil which will in time become also
a 1-2g.slative body.

In regard to assembly programs,
my plan will call for a more varied
and interesting program. From the
few conferences I have attended I
have discovered that State is per-
haps the leading college in regards
to Student government in the State.
I am sponsoring a plan to amplify
this position and to keep State al-

Racial Problems
Tepic For Forum

Noted Arab, Zionist,
Upheld Dillcrcni Views

Two unusual and contrasting
speakers, one an Arab, the other
a Zionist, will present a discussion
of the Zionist situation in Palestine
at the next meeting of Forum to be
held Wednesday in the Lounge at
3:30 p. m. A member of the New
York District Zionist Organization
will introduce the Zionist program
for a Jewish state in Palestine, while
Peter George, President of the In-
stitute of Arab-American Relations
will uphold the Arab point of view.

About twenty-ﬁve years ago the
Mandate to Palestine on the basis of
the Balfour Declaration guaranteed
a national home for the Jewish peo-
ple in Palestine. According to the
Zionists the Arab leaders promised
full cooperation; however, through
the past few years strong opposition
has arisen, especially among the
Arab terrorists and aristocrats. The
movement has now spread until to-
day there is unmistakable animosity
to the Jewish state from all Arabs
except the ordinary laborer.
Zionists vs. Arabs

It cannot be overlooked that the
Zionists built up Palestine to the
ﬂourishing nation of today. They
drained the unyielding marshes, be-
gan a collective farm organization
and in addition to boosting shipping
and commerce, fostered a “back to
the soil" movement to insure Pales-
tine production. On the other hand
the Arabs claim they are being
driven out of their country, they sup-
port their somewhat primitive civil-
ization, and the wealthier men do
not enjoy the looming Jewish compe-
tition which this growth of Zionism
will bring about.

Relation to Future Peace

These two speakers will fully dis-
cuss and weigh these two contend-
ing viewpoints. Mr. George is a
former Palestinian Arab and his
aims on this matter are well estab-
lished.

Fredrick, Seniors Will Meet

Dr. Robert Fredrick, principal of
Milne High School, and Miss Mary
D. Alberts, head of the Student Em-
ployment Bureau, have announced
that they will meet today with all
Seniors who haven’t signed contracts
but who are interested in a teaching
job. The meeting, which will begin
at noon, is scheduled for the Little
Theatre in Milne.

Student CounCil
Discusses Plans

With New Group

Representatives of a new State
College organization. a committee
of 15 interested in inter-cultural
problems, appeared before Student
Council Wednesday night to out-
line their plans and explain why
they believe they should have a
place on the budget. The group,
which has no official name as yet,
was indorsed by the Council mem-
bers- and advised to submit their
budget to the Student Board of
Finance.

Formation Explained

Jean Groden. ’46, explained that
the committee was formed when
nine students and six faculty mem-
bers met last semester to discuss
problems of racial and cultural
groups. Some of the work done un-
officially by the committee includes
the securing of speakers such as

Julius Thomas, who addressed the '

assembly, and a legislator from
Harlem who explained the Ives-
Quinn Bill. -
Radio In Lounge

Dr. John M. Sayles, who met with
the Council Tuesday, announced
that a new radio could not be se-
cured for the Lounge and has of-
fered the radio now in his office
in its place.
Arbitration Report

It was- decided at Wednesday’s
meeting that starting next semester
the mimeograph machine and the
Used Book Exchange would be un-
der the supervision of Campus
Commission, instead of being un-
der the direct control of Student
Council. A feature of the evening
was an informal report on the Am-
erican Arbitration Association Con-
ference, held in New York over va-
cation. Florence Garfall, president
of Student Association, and Cecile
Goldberger, Seniors, and Robert
Sullivan, ’46, will attend a meeting
in Syracuse over the weekend for
a further discussion of Arbitration
with representatives of other State
Colleges of New York.

The Student Council
will be held Wednesday, May 9, the
last meeting before the new council
is announced on Moving Up Day,
May 11.

The meeting in Chancellor’s Hull

ute to our lute President. Franklin

in his honor.

As Mr. Mowror begun to speak,
his wide lmowicdgc. unulytlcul pow~
ers, and keen judgment become more

so that everyone can help in formu-

lating world peace. If the common
man cannot make u lasting peace,
no one man can do it for him.

The Dumburion Oaks proposals,
continued Mr. Muwrer, represent a
conun'omisc between the powerful
super-state and the voluntary organ-
ization resembling the League of Nu-
lions.

One of the reasons that Russia
is holding out for her promised three
votes at the Sun Francisco Confer-
ence is her four that the American
nations will vote as a block, follow-
ing the example of the United States.
Mr. Mowror. having had practical
experience with these republics at
the Mexico City Conference, stated
thui this is untrue. These small
status have only their soverignty on
which to rely. sovereignty-—tho "i‘rce-
dam to wage war.” it will take great
diplomacy, lust. and probably years
besides to accustom them to the
idea of u Dowcri‘ul intornutioxml or-
gunlsution.

Because even the final pluns for
this security organization will be
weak. due to pressure from small

states, and because there will be
many cimngos needed with the pass-
ing 01‘ time, Mr. Mowrer feels that
tho amending process is too rigid,
since any one of the ﬁve big powers
of the Security Council can stop the
passage of an amendment. He pro-
poses u standing committee to sug—
gest changes and that the whole
procedure be loosened.

Are We going to go nationalist
again? usks Mr. Mowrcr. National-
ism, in this age, is the opposite of
patriotism. If the organization is to
work we will huvr to stop our con-
descending attitude toward ruciul
minorities. How can We have com-
ploto cooperation with u people who
will not be allowed in our best ho-
leis?

Peace is lndivisible; prosperity
and democracy are becoming indi-
visiblo. Freedom cannot be allowed
to be suppressed anywhere. The fu-
ture is in the hands of Youth.
