v f. The. proposed plan to increase the

{male ’enrollnient at State College has
aroused a, great deal of curiosity as
well as ridicule. Therefore, the pur-
‘ pose; in writing this article is to bet-
ter acquaint youwith the plan and
to enlist , year aid in making the
venture successful.

Plan For Publicity V '
Our plan is to. send letters to re-
-4 cent graduates of State who were
prominent here and are interested in
the Welfare of the college. Many of
these Alumni are teaching in the sec-
ondary- schools of the state from
which we draw many of our students.

These letters will be in the mail
by the end of this week. The Alumni
will bring State College to the atten-
tion of prospective freshmen before
the Intreviewing Board meets in key
cities of the State. By sending these
letters to our Alumni, more can be
accomplished than if the Principals
of different high schools were con-
tacted. In this way the letters won’t
be thrown in wastepaper baskets and
forgotten.

WhatTo Do
Your part in supporting this plan
is personally to encourage high
school seniors in your own home
town who areundecided about their
choice of a college. We are author-
. ized to make it known that students
with a Regents average of 85% may
be eligible for admission and these
people are encouraged to write for
an application blank. We are espec-
ially interested in athletes or those
who had experience in that line. For
them State College offers an excel-
lent opportunity to further their
athletic interests under the new pro-
posal.

Ground work

We decided that we should ﬁrst
consult Dr. Sayles, Dr. Nelson, Dr.
Dorwaldt, Dean Stokes and other
key faculty members to seek advice
and endorsement before going ahead.
This we have been able to do. and we
are glad to say that we enjoy full
support from the Administration.
Now our problem is to convince you,
the students of State College. that
we have something worthwhile, and
to gain your support in this imme-
diate undertaking.

We realize that the male enroll-
ment has slumped, due mainly to the
war. but we feel that State in the
past ,has not enjoyed enough pub-
licity in the secondary schools of
New York State. In short. we have
had nothing to offer prospective
freshmen in comparison to the fea
tures that we are now in a position
to publicize. The new $500,000
gym and athletic field will be com-
pleted as soon as the building sup-
plies can be released from govern-
ment contracts. A complete line of
athletic supplies will be purchased
and State will once more be on an
intercollegiate athletic basis. Next
year we hope to schedule a limited
basketball season with neighboring
colleges who enjoy approximately
the same male enrollment that State
now has. '

ln Conclusion

We sincerely feel that our plan will
be successful and we are willing to
put the necessary time and effort on
it to achieve our ultimate goal. We
ask your enthusiasm and coopera-
tion to put State College on the map
to stay.

 

 

 

ln Soliboll'Closh

This afternoon at 3:30 the Sopho-
more and freshmen softball teams
will once again try to boost their
respective classes in rivalry. This is
the first scheduled softball game to
be played this year, and it promises
to be a real thriller.

The freshmen loom as a real
threat to the experienced Gremlins.
From watching both teams practice,
it is impossible to tell which has the
edge. Both teams are very evenly
matched. Diehl and Tilden are the
most powerful hitters for '48, while
Baker and Margot seem to be on
the ball for ’47.

Freshmen

Looking over the teams individu-
ally, the frosh lineup first—either
Lengyel or Archito are probabilities
for pitchers. Valentine, Maginess,
and Shapiro are all veterans of the
ﬁeld and promise to look more than
good from the sidelines. Boynton
(of basketball fame), Young and Os-
borne are other prospects for '48.
However, this is only tentative as
anything could happen. There’s lots
of hidden talent around and many
48ers hitherto undiscovered will put
in an appearance.
Vs. Sophomores

Now for ’47—the ﬁrst and only
bad thing is the loss of Russo who
was a powerful hitter last year.
Nielsen, Sweeney and Davidson
from last year are still going strong.
Positions on the ’47 team have not
been announced at present, but it
looks as though either-Sllvernail,
Day or Telian will pitch—O’Grady,
Doran and Wakin are all strong hit-
ters and are more than efficient in
the ﬁeld.

Swimming Meet Wednesday

Week-ends at Camp Johnston will
be scheduled later on. Times will be
posted on the WAA bulletin board.

The rivalry swim meet, scheduled
to be played this week, was again
postponed. The play-off will take
place Wednesday evening, 7:30, at
the Public Bath number three on
Central and Ontario. Those intend-
ing to participate, are asked to be
there by 7:15. The teams would ap-
preciate it if all those who are able
would come to cheer.

Pi Gamma Adds 5 Members

Carolyn Hasbrouck, ’45, President
of Pi Gamma Mu, national honorary
social studies fraternity, has an-
nounced the addition of five new
members to the organization.

Those students who maintain a B
average in a social studies major or
minor throughout three years of
college are admitted to Pi Gamma
Mu. Recently admitted to the so-
ciety are: Ruth Coivin, Jeanne Ro-
set. Jeun Sivers, and Abbie Swycx‘,
Juniors.

Phi Delta Wins
Bowling Title

The bowling championship was
decided as Phi Delt triumphed over
KD in one of the closest matches of
the season Tuesdays afternoon at
the Paladium. The ﬁnal score re-
sulted in a 635-602 lead for the Phi—
Delt team.

One Pin Game

The first game revealed how even-
ly matched these two squads were
as KD emerged victorious with the
score 717 to 716.. Trudy Smith was
high scorer with 159 and Skinner,
Seymour and Glevin were just a pin
behind. It was a tense game with
the ﬁnal outcome questionable un-
til the last frame.

Scores Slump

Both teams were eager to win the
second contest and in their deter-
mination lost the sure, steady bow1~
ing that had characterized the earl-
ier game. The team scores fell so
noticeably that there was almost a
hundred pinnage difference in the
ﬁnal result. The most outstanding
increases in individual scores were
by Harris and Crumm who were
high scorers for their teams.

Tuesday‘s game was necessary to KD

decide the ﬁnal championship.
The individual scores for

games are as follows:

In answer to popular demand—all
four names will be furnished on re?
quest—we return to fourth page
where we may continue to dispense
our gems of wisdom uninhibited. It.
is good to be back—eépecially when
we realize that there are only three
more issues of the NEWS in which
we may inﬂict our particular brand
of torture on an unsuspecting public.
With the end of the year and of our
college career in' sight. we ﬁght back
an impulse to reminisce—but decide
to save that for a later date.

WAA voting, of course, belongs to
history. Officers for the coming year
were decided in yesterday’s election.
From the looks of the ballot a lively,
interested group of gels was up for
the various offices. As we see it,
WAA can't go wrong next year. We
particularly want to compliment.
WAA on the passage of an amend-
ment to its constitution providing
that president and vice-president be
listed on the same ballot. The girl
receiving the larger number of votes
will be president, second highest,
vice-president. In this way, a girl
who has worked for WAA three
years is not dropped in her senior
year because she happens to be elim-
inated in the contest for the presi-
dency. It is an effective method of
insuring continuation of interest in
the organization and of keeping good
‘people within the set-up.

Speaking of history brings to mind
the tennis tournament. If memory
serves us correctly, there is one
match left to decide the winner
of the trophy. A tennis champ
would be a nice thing to have
around school. Here‘s hoping
that the weather clears up, the ten-
nis courts open and both contes-
tants remain in good health.

Seniors-R960” "Famous Firsts” Democratic inter-Grout!) Politico!

As Last Year Draws To'Close-

Next week the “grand old Seniors"
will advance to the safety of the
wide, wide world in the best Moving
UpyDay tradition. Recorded on the
pages of the STATE COLLEGE News
for the past four years are stories
of famous first which will earn the
Class of ’45 a high place in the
history of the school.

The Crimson Tide first burst upon
State in September of 1941 and
went the way of all freshmen. They
went to Fresh Camp, attended
smokers and open houses, and
were orientated every Monday in
the usual way. Nora Giavelli
brought forth a torrent of praise
and wrath when she—a mere fresh
and a woman to boot—~wont out
for the varsity tennis team. Flo
Garfall gained fame that year as
the first woman fresh president in
twelve years.

The orntorical powers of the
class became evident when three
fresh successfuly upheld the af-
firi‘native in a debate with the
Sophs.

And 1041 was the year that
Eleanor Hayslip gained further
glory for her class by accumulating
the staggering total of six A's for
the first semester.

The next September found the
Class of ’45, now hardened veterans.
playing host to a new group of
fresh. With all the practice gained
the year before, ’45 led in rivalry
all the way and gained an easy vic—
tory. Hal Goldstein and Kippy
Marsh, other famous members of a
famous class, will long be remem-
bered as the authors of many of
the Sophomore skits that year.

But all activities took second place
to the war. Men who had enlisted
in the reserve corps were being,
called for active service, and the
ratio of three women to one man
soared upward rapidly. Everyone
wont nil-out for War Activities, and

Weinberg,
Plan New Ballot

The subject slated for discussion
this week by the Constitutional
Committee has been announced by
Gerhard Weinberg, ’47, chairman of
the commission, as the Preferential
Voting System. This will be one
of the last major discussions.

According to Weinberg the com-
mittee will seek to correct two out-
standing flows which the committee
feels exist in the application of the
system now in use. These difficul-
ties occur chlofly in plural voting
when more than one person has to
be elected for the same office. The
first difficulty lies in the distribu-
tion of the surplus, since in the
present system only those votes
which are over the quota When a
candidate has been elected are re-
distributed.

This leads to a second difficulty
since in a recounting of ballots it
Would be possible that a different
portion of the surplus might be re-
distributed and in a very small
number of cases might make a dif-
ference in the candidate chosen.

A correction of these flaws has
been suggested by Weinberg and by
Bob Hardt. '48, who have been work-
ing on this portion of the Consti-
tution. The most recent plan work-
ed out eliminates more than one
distribution so that it will improve
the single voting procedure in addi-
tion to correcting the plural voting
difficulties. In the proposed sys-
tem the ballot would be marked
with us many first choices as there
are candidates to be elected for
that office. The remaining candl-
dute would be marked preferenti-
ally us before. In counting the bal-
lets a system of points would be as-
signed to each candidate so that a
candidate Would receive the same
number of points as the number
marked before his name.

His points would be added and the
number of candidates to be elected
would be chosen on the basis of the
lowest number of points. In case

l'iardt‘

 

‘45 established another “first” by
voting to give up plans for the
annual Sophomore Soiree.

Rivalry was now over for ’45, but
the new Juniors still maintained a
full program of activities. The Class
of ’47 was welcomed by its "big
sister" with a genuine Kentucky
Mountain ‘musicai in Page.

In spite of all this activity, however,
it was the Class of ’45 which led the
Dean’s List at the end of the first
semester! Dr. Louis Jones, State's
own authority on spooks and haunts,
spoke at the Junior Banquet of the
“Ghosts of '45”—men from the class
who were scattered over the entire
globe in the service of their country.

But '45 had a reputation to main-
tain, and they again led the Way as
the first class to crown a May
Queen. Eunice Wood was the choice
of the school, and she reigned su-
preme during the Junior Big 10.

Ch the more serious side of the
ledger, the entire class is proud to
share with ’44 the honor of starting
plans for the Student Union which
will soon. be a reality. And it was

Cecile Goldberger who last year in-'

stigated plans for the reorganized
Student Council which we now
have.

The Class of ’45 began their
Senior year with an old-fashioned
Minstrel Show—and with no cur-
tain on the stage! Out-doing all
former feats, the Crimson Tide
made history by presenting the
school with its first all—women
l‘dyskania. The Seniors are going
all~eut for Stucco-.2 Union.

A class such as this can never be
forgotten by those who have ‘-: iown
iliem and worked with them. Nest
Friday the Seniors will move up
from State, but they will ne'vei
really move out.

 

Three Slate Religious Clubs
Plan Joinf Picnic Af Dorm

Hey, Joe, have you signed up
yet? For what? Where have you
been this past week? For the pic-
nic that the Religious Clubs are
throwing at the Dorm Field on
May lS—natch.’

There won’t be any invocation
at the beginning or benediction
at the end either. Fun, and plea-
sure will be the motif—strictly.
So everyone is invited—that is,
practically everyone. There is one
prerequisite which may elimin-
ate a few people—one must have
the grand total of 15 cents. This
is simply to cover the expenses
of food. publicity, entertainment
and all the other things which
may be used to attract crowds of
people.

From 5:30 to 8:00 P.M., the
wanning hours of the day, twi-
light time, etc., there will be food,
fun. and festivities for all who at-
tend the Religious Clubs picnic.

Seniors Schedule
Final Activities

Class Night To Close
College Career Ol '45

The traditional Moving-Up Day
exercises and a Senior Weekend
from June 15 to 18 will feature the
activities of the Class of ’45 for the
renmiuing weeks of school. Joan
Smith. '45. class president, has an-
nounced a general schedule for the
period.

he main event on Moving Up
Day will be the presentation of the
Ivy Speaker, Martha Joyce. A class
banquet at Jack‘s Restaurant will
open the Senior Weekend on Fri-
day, June 15. Guests will be Dr.
and Mrs. J. Alan Hicks, Dr. and
Mrs. Louis Jones, Dr. Margaret
Hayes, Dr. Watt Stewart, and Dr.
Matic Green. Entertainment will be
given during the evening.
Class Day

Saturday, June 16. is designated
as Class Day. The ﬁrst event on the
program is a skit written by Edna
Marsh and Ruth Fine, Seniors. The
basis of the plot is a recollection of
the time when the men of ’45 were
here at State and then a panoramic
view of the places where they are
now. The various acts, each repre-
senting a different country, will be
set in such places as Hawaii, France
and Italy. The skit will close with
the chorus singing three numbers—
“My Heart Stood Still," "There's a

‘ Long. Long Trail Awinding," and an

arrangement by Martha Sprenger of
a new song “The Weary Road” writ-
ten by Miss Marsh.

'l‘orchliglit Service

This will be followed by the class
historian. Gertrude Yanowitz; class
poet, Ruth Fine; and class prophet,
Edna Marsh. In the evening the
traditional Torchlight Service will
be held in front of Draper.

As the service begins the Seniors
march out of Page Hall carrying
their torches. Each torch is lit as
the person comes out of the door,
and on the steps the torch bearers
join their Seniors. The group pro-
ceeds to the Page Hall lawn, and
the Class of '45 is officially welcom-
ed into the Alumni Association by
the president of the organization.
This is symbolized by a large torch
presented to Jean Smith. class pres-
ident. At this time the Seniors
hand their torches to the bearers,
while the group sings “Follow the
Gleam." As the procession moves
off the torches are extinguished one
by one,

Herald, '48. the butler.

Marianne Davis, ’46, will also pre-
sent a short play whose plot revolves
around the struggle of two women,
one married, one single, for the at-
fection of the same man. The cast
includes Mary Ellen Dicner, '47, as
Katherine, the single woman, Gloria

Edith Dell, '48, the maid.

- The Inter-Group Council, a stud
dent faculty committeeirecently or,-
ganized to offer opportunitieswfor
culture contact and understanding
among members of every 'race and
nationality in the college and in
the community, today will apply for,
its initial budget appropriation from
the Student Association. .

At present there are ten students
and six faculty members comprising
the executive board. Student mem-
bers are Edna Marsh, Joan Groden,
and Eleanor Hayeslip, Seniors, Shir-
ley Passow, Helen Slack Schure and
Marion Carter, Juniors, Celena Ax-
elrod and Kay Hagerty, Sophomores,
and Phyllis Witt Penn and Sue
O’Connell, freshmen. Faculty mem-
bers are Louis C. Jones, Dr. Stand-
ing, Miss Mary E. Conklin, Dr. Watt
Stewart, Dr. Allan J. Hicks and‘Miss
Margaret Hayes. Membership in the
Council is open to all students in:
terested in working on one of the
five standing committees.

In February, a group of students
who recognized the growing empha-
sis on inter-group cooperation met
with several faculty members to
plan the best method to put these
ideas into best equipped to carry out
and to find out what local, civic and
national organizations it could co-
operate with in the most beneficial
way. Dr. LeRoy Bowman Jr. direc-
tor of adult education in New York
State, suggested that the council
meet with local culture groups and
exchange ideas. He also recom-
mended channeling of democratic
principles through cirrieulum of the
college. The council has contacted
as many Albany organizations as
possible and also certain national
organizations, since one purpose of
the organization is to bring State
College into a closer cooperation
with these organizations which work
for democratic, principles.

Following this a tea was held at
Sayles Hall for Langston Hughes,
prominent Negro author and poet.
Shortly after, the State College
group wrote to Majority Leader Ir-
ving Ives asking how State College
could help supplement the educa-
tional provisions of the bill. Mr.
Ives congratulated the college group
for its awareness of the need for
public education and stated that the
students would be called upon when
proper machinery has been estab-
lished.

The committee itself will be open
to membership by every interested
member of the college. A central
committee has been set up in the
constitution which will carry out the
executive and legislative duties of
the group. This committee is com-
posed of fifteen people representing
every class and incorporating as
many races and religions as it can.
Seniors members of the Council will
be replaced by election of the
Council from those people who have _
show the most interest in the work
of the society. The Council will
also take into consideration the
afore-mentioned composition of the
committee practice.

Provision is also made in the Com
stitution for rotation every year of
the faculty that the same six mem-
bers will not compose the faculty
section of the group. Students who
join the organization will work on
one of the five standing committees.

The committee has contacted the
Faculty Committee appointed by Dr.
John M. Sayles. President of the
College, since it was felt the two
organizations were working for many
of the same aims.

The committee has extensive plans
to set in operation next year. Sev-
eral speakers will be brought to the
school. some in classes, some in small
groups, and others for the college
as a whole. The committee will at-
tempt to channel as many of its so.
tivities as possible.
