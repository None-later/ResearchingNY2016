Funny thing. I catch myself smilin at more     .. .. .
people lately. And still more often I’m cgught with s” “MI MN“ mum
my memOry down. Faces beam friendship at me

. with features somehow familiar . . . and I’m
ashamed to ﬁnd out that they, too, are ‘45.

All of a sudden I want to know all of them bet-
ter, and ﬁnd myself asking almost-perfect-stranger's
(people I never even bothered for the time last
month) terribly personal questions like “How much
money you getting next year?” or even “Why don’t “"5"”; WWW”: NEW?“
you get married instead?” . . . and getting a decent fiﬁfl'ifhiﬁﬁu,
answer instead of the slap in the' face I deserve. Malling . - ~ - - - . - . ~ . - ~ ~ . - . -~

Sure, we’re allvsick of studying. We can’t wait '
to graduate, so that we can dish it out for a change
. . . But once in a while we catch ourselves thinking
a little fondly of the poetry course we meant to
take, or the early lit class we wish we hadn’t slept
through. Less

It’ll pass, I guess. We’ll slip back into the im-
portance of our own everyday matters, and the re—
grets won’t matter so much as time goes by. But
not till way after June.

Teddy Fine, ’45
' 1945 has been far from a dead and listless class;
it seems to muster up an overwhelming spirit, a slap-
happy skit, or a “Big 8” in a few hours. And re-
member the hilarity of putting on the great pro-
ductions by Kippy and the “Immortal Yo Yo.”

It was a member of ’45 who suggested the en-
larging of Student Council which took over this
year. Most important is their contributions to. States
place among other colleges. Council attended three
conventions; became acquainted with other coi-
leges and has started to establish State as a leader

of ’45, for it is the class we love so well—it’s the J i L i I ‘

for all, and all for one” with we '45’ers.

Talking Turkey... '

By MICHAEL

‘ .

It is the policy of the state Col-
lege New to review the theatre as
produced on the Page Hall boards.
and this, for the record, is a re-
view. Last Friday night's fiasco,
howover, could hardly be regarded
as theatre though buried under that
pretense.

Patrick Hamilton’s Angel Street
survived Broadway’s storybook
whimsy and blurbed its way to the
smash line on a wave of applause,
spot. deficiencies in the script put-
tied in by the adept acting of Leo
G. Carroll and Judith Evelyn. For
the melodrama’s punch lies in the
two protagonistic forces, Inspector
Rough and Bella Manningham.

The Wee Theatre’s production of
Mr. Hamilton’s story of gasllt New
York (Revised from its original
London setting) was indeed a sad
apple. One may generalize and lay
claim to its many flaws in the one
charge, stiff acting, a coverall for
major and minor theatrical crimes,
and one for which the size of a
stage is not to blame.

Charles Leo Miller, as Inspector
Rough, the detective with a twinkle
in his eye, twinkled a bit too much
and thereby lost; a flow- of audience
response. He was out of character
a great deal of the time, changing
his walk and the quality of his
voice at intervals. In spite of this,
nevertheless, it must be admitted
that. Mr. Miller provided the few
refreshing moments to be found be-
fore the footlights that evening.

For Robert; Johnson’s Jack Mann-
ingham, not much can be said. He,
as both actor and director, appar-
ently forth that a change of pace
in the play, especially in almost the
balance of the first. act, depends
heavily on voice inflection, volume
and speed. As a result, it dragged
considerably. Mr. Johnson also dis-
regarded convention in the misuse
of his downstage foot in walking,
and crossing in front of an actor
doing a long line, unforgivable sins
that even an Elementary Dramaties
student would hesitate to commit
before the most unobservant audi-
ence. And his gestures, which were

infrequent. were artificial. I also
suggest that Mr. Johnson’s future
wardrobes be pocketless.

Bella Manningham, portrayed by
Annette Johnson, follows a. similar
pattern. It was a high-pitched.
over-emotional Bella that was seen
in her interpretation. When one
savors the memory of Judith Eve-
lyn and Ingrid Bergman as the
phycho-neurotic, in a performance of
suspended restraint that made the
emotionalism outstandingly real
and plausible, it is with distaste
that one thinks of the hysterics
scene of Mrs. Johnson. It was ter-
r.ble.

About the other two members of
the cast, the same is true.
beth, the housekeeper (I forgot the
name cf the woman who played the
part) was synthetic, especially in
the scene where she spied the blank
space on the wall where the miss-
ing picture belonged. And Ellen
Fay, as the maid, turned in a flaw-
less jeb of overacting.

Yawn.

llC'lrem Cafe,l o Raise
War Activity Funds

Dancing, Coke Bar, Bridge
Will Provide Entertament

The Greln Cafe, sponsored by the
Sophomore Class, will hold its
opening night celebration in the
Commons this evening at 8:00 PM.
Lorna Kunz, '47, chairman of
Sophomore war activities, is in
charge of the event.

Dancing, bridge, and entertain-
ment will be enjoyed throughout the
evening with floor shows starting
at 8:45 P.M., 10:00 RM, and 11:15
PM. Betty Brennan, chairman of
the entertainment committee, will
direct these shows with George
Hess acting as master of ceremonies.
Two wandering fortune tellers dis-
guised as Swami and Balmy prom-
ise to be available throughout the
evening to reveal the patrons' pasts.

Prominent performers from the
Sophomore Big Eight and the
Sayles Hall Canteen have offered
their talent for the cafe shows.
Eleanor Binn will render a novelty
selection “Nobody Makes A Pass
At Me" while Muriel Reubin is
slated to sing that memorable song
“Temptation.” The unforgettable
Can-Can girls, Julie Collier, Judy
Dube, Janet Inglehart, Gertrude
Smith, Celina Axelrod and Carol
Berg will once again make their de-
but with a clever dance routine.
Spike Silvernail will also include a
few appropriate selections and a
background of boogie woogie music
will be prevalent during intermit-
ting performances.

Miss Kunz announces that “sev-
eral hostesses and waitresses have
been procured to give special serv-
ice to all students." The Sopho-

Ebrary For Rhoods Hospital Possible Use

As the '44-'45 series of Big Eights
draws to a close with the Junior
Production on May 19, the problem
arises as to the expenditure of pro-
fits gained. Today in assembly each
vote cast. will be a determining fac-
tor in the allocation of approxim-
ately $1800 to one of the three major
possibilities. Since the Big Eights
were instituted in State as the col-
lege's biggest single war effort, all
three are, of course, “war—minded."
but in varying degrees.

For exul‘nple, number one provides
that the money be invested in a War
Bond which, on maturity, will be
handed over to the Student. Union
Fund. If this action is decided
upon, the money will be an added
source to the regular Student Union
Budget as set up last year. A! the!
film: the tux-prairf'ilurc of the profits
of UN: Big Eights was not decided
upon; such. expenditure was to in:
loft lo llic lilacrotloli of the student
body of ouch. succeeding year.

Another possibility is giving $1000
to Rhoads Army General Hospital
for it library and the remainder to
the Student Union. At first glance
this seems the most advantageous
to all parties concerned. After flir—
ither consideration it is obvious that
‘this plan too has a strong loop-
‘hole. A beautifully furnished li-
brary is worth little unless it is
well provided with books. The toll-
totlve cost of furnishing the library

By B. ,l. McGRATlI, O’BRIEN
is $1,000. Therefore, under this plan
there would be. no money left for
the purchase of books.

The final possibility is perhaps
the most logical and the most
worthy of careful consideration.
This status that the entire proceeds
of the Big Eights be given to
Rhonda Hospitulrrrthc first $1,000
for furnishing, and the remainder
for books. In this way a complete
and well-equipped library will be
established for the use of over—sens
invulids recuperating from battle
wounds.

Many arguments have been given
against this latter plan. and liltin-
erous questions have been asked as
to why Rhoads General Hospital
should be the recipient of State's
money.

it has been asked why the Fed-
eral Government does not provide
the hospital with the much-noticed
library. At present, the government
is in the process of building army
hospitals all over the country and of
equipping those hospitals with the
best medical equipment. There is
neither time, money. our interest
for building a library iii Rhonda.

The question has been raised as
to why Rhonda Hospital should be
chosen. Several State girls have
visited Rhonda during the past few
months as members of an enter-
taining troupe. Willie there, they
were taken on a tour of the hospital

Bldg 3 Profit:

and buildings and were both as-
tonished and shocked at the small,
and almost useless, library. There
present library is about the size of
the State 00—01); yet, the library
must be used by 2500 men. The
books are few and cover a very
small range of interests. Books are
one of the most valuable forms of
mental therapy and are needed bad-
ly.

Most of the cases are orthopedic
patients suffering from shrapnel
and leg wounds. Their main form
of entertainment is reading. One
fellow shecplslily admitted that he
was reading the same comic book
for the fourth time because he had
nothing else to read. Many of the
men wish to continue their educa-
tion while they are convalescing.
For them, deucntional texts and
factual books are necessary. A.
store of good light readingr is also
essential.

Little more can be said. The need
is there perhaps even the duty is
there, and State has the money . . .

Sawdust Caesar lies in a pauper’s
grave, executed by his own Coun-
trymen. Those who once hailed
him as creator of the new Latin em-
pire dumped his body in the public
square, spat on him and his mis-
tress, cursed him with the passion
which once impelled their allegi-
ance, buried him in potter’s field.

We, who scarcely knew of Matte-
otti or the Rosselli brothers, liberals
murdered by the Italian Fascists;
we, to whom Fascism was Verdi
farce on a realscale—untll Italians
began bombing Ethiopians, killing
French, siding with Nazis—we were
horrified at the gutter death of
Benito Mussolini.

Within this week, Adolph Hitler
has been pronounced dead. Hero,
suicide, hoax? The world is skep-
tical and even indifferent. The
chaos which Hitler helped to loose
has numbed too many minds for his
exit to bring joy, Not even the
Jews, whose destruction was Hitler’s
prime aim, nor the Russians, whose
promised defeat won Hitler support
among respectable businessmen in
Allied countries, can find any pleas-
ure in his passing.

After a time, history will evaluate
the forces and misery which urged
Germany to make a deity out. of a
neurotic. From this, the preventive
may be learned. A prescription may
be in the making new in San Fran-
cisco.

The first week at; UNCIO has

testified to the mounting influence-

of the Soviet Union and the United
States. At the same time, there is
evidence that the great hurdle—
maintaining American-Soviet-Brit-
lsh teamwork—is being met. skill—
fully. Despite pressures which could
split the conference into an Anglo-
American and a Soviet camp, the
delegation leaders of the Big Four
seem keenly conscious of and pre-
pared to dissolve the dangers of
disunity.

These dangers include the Polish
question. still a question mark; the
entry of Argentina into the confer-

Frosh Scuttle ’47 Banner
Under Spreading Oak Tree

Saturday afternoon the Cam-
pus of State College became a
“happy hunting ground"—-—Daf—
ﬁes versus Gremlins —- Golden
Supremacy versus Green Envy——
and two banners at stake.

The Daffy team, highlighted by
Spark-plug Sparky’s excellent
“scout-find-and-capture” tech-
nique rose to their full. unpreced-
ented power as they whisked the
coveted green treasure to safety.

Meanwhile the Greedy Grem-
lins Were rampaging the halls
of Ye Olde Alma Mater but to
no avail. Wishing to console
themselves—or maybe they can’t
read yet—they made off with the
’44 banner, raced through Draper,
an avalanche of Dail‘ies, a bloody
brawl. and the Daffles again
reigned supreme.

Now that this event is so glor-
iously etched in the history of ri-
valry and the Green Gremlins
fallen from their high horse of
supreinilcy, the outcome of ri-
valry is more than promising for
the Golden Class. Beware. ’47——
this is the forecast of things to
come!

“The Fresh"

 

 

the American amendments to the
Dumbarton Oaks agreement. ,

Argentina was admitted to per-‘
ttclpation at the insistence of the
Latin-American nations. The U. 8.
now stands in the pivot point' of
the 21 American nations at the con-
ference, and along with the British
Empire could outvote the Soviet
Union on any issue, if it so desired;
Al; preSent the Soviets have three
votes in the conference. plus those
of a sympathetic nations. They
have already been outvot‘ed on At-
gentina and are still arguing for
admission of the Warsaw Polish
government. However, Molotoff is
said to have influenced Stettinius'
statement that Argentina must
prove its sincere adherence to the
cause of United Nations before the
conference grants that government
an important position.

Twice this week Molotoff, Eden,
T. V. Soong and Stiettinius met at
private suppers to talk over the
basic issues as friends. Such meet-
ings will do much to maintain the
good will which so far has prevent-
ed arguments from becoming too
final. Thus, after Russia’s set-
backs this week, Molotoff reaffirm-
ed the USSR’s desire to see the
conference succeed in its aim of
launching the security organization.
News that Molotoff planned
leave for home in a few days came
as an unpleasant surprise, at first:
it; has since been pointed out: that
Germany's disintegration may well
demand the presence of more than
one foreign minister at his own of-
fine.

Finally, the American delegation’s
proposed amendments are being
presented at the keynote to secur-
ing the U. S. Senate’s ratification

of the conference decision. Never-
theless, if this college junior may
be allowed a few pessimistic guesses,
we have a sinking sensation at the
sound of some of the amendments.
Briefly this is what Senators Van-
denburg and Connally are urging:
1. An amendment that a constitu-
tional convention be called Within
12 years to amend or revise the
proposed constitution of .he organ-
ization. 2. Greater power for the
general assembly, to revise regional
agreements, hear grievances, enforCe
the Atlantic Charter. 3. Machinery
for the “orderly Withdrawal" of a
nation from the security organiza-
tion.

We agree with the opponents of
this last proposal that its adoption
will react negatively on the psycho-
logy of the organization builders. It
may be a realistic appeal to mac»-
tionary senators but 45 nations will
also interpret; this, each in its own
way. Their reaction is quite as
vital as the U. S. Senate's.
