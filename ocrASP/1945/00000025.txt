 “The ideas on which democracy

‘ v is based‘were being undermined in

.the democracies long before they
were, uprooted in the totalitarian
countries.” , , r 7 >

At first glance, the proposed
council to further relations among
races. cultures and religions seems
to be the very essence ofa working
democracy.- Closer “examination,
however,‘ brings out implications
that are fraught with danger—not
only, for democracy, but for the very
cause which the council seeks to
champion.

To get down to a common denom-
inator—there is a very small per-
centage, if any, of the students at
State College who are opposed to
the basic ideal of such a group.
The fallacy of preaching interna-
tional equality and brotherhood
when some races and religions
within our own borders are not
treated as equals, has long been
recognized as a. weakness of our
democracy. Clearly, too, something
must be done to correct the contra-
diction before it becomes too much
of a talking point for enemy pro-
paganda along racial. lines.

State College is more free from
prejudice than most other colleges
in the country. An attempt to root
out all prejudice would disclose the
fact that most of what exists, either,
arises from personality differences
rather than from any deep-seated
prejudice; or, is an attempt to ra-
tionalize his own failings on the
part of the supposedly persecuted
individual. In bringing out these
reported prejudices, however, the
situation will have been exaggerated
and enlarged upon to prove a point.
Actually more feeling will be gen-
erated than exists already.

Pressure, legislation, and propa-
ganda can, in a short time, produce
the outward signs of tolerance.
Education is the only method by
which complete and lasting under-
standing is attainable. But, this
education must be slow and subtle.
Trying to force an idea upon peo-
ple, allowing no other course of
action than the one mapped out
by a central committee is a guar-
anteed method of arousing anta-
gonism for a.. idea—among intelli-
gent, thinking people. Looking
back over assembly and club activ-
ities of the past few years, it be-
comes obvious that the program of
education has been going on —-
without benefit of label or steering
committee. SCA, Newman Club
and Hillel have sponsored such
speakers as Lester Granger. Father
Fisher, Julius Thomas, Rabbi Gold-
berg. Students have worked with
the Booker T. Washington center.
Forum has conducted discussions
and debates on racial and cultural
topics. D&A and Music Council
have brought to the college people
of other cultures. There is no mon-
opoly on tolerance. All this comes
about naturally. Equality is the
coming trend in Social thought—it
is what students are interested in
and it is what their leaders must
supply in order to remain leaders.

Organizations are already func-
tioning in the college to do the
things which the inter-group coun-
cil proposes to do—Student Council,
Debate, Forum, the religious clubs,
etc. By their very name and pur-
pose the Council assumes a higher
authority than the established
groups whose activities they seek to
coordinate. It would seem that for
such a council to operate. it would
need the permission of the organ-
izations it plans to advise. As for
the power of the sub-committee on
student-administration relations. it’s
only fair-play that some member of
the administration be included.
After all. if one reasons logically, it
follows that it is just as undemo-
cratic for students to dominate the
administration as it is for the ad-
ministration to dominate the stu.
dents.

Anything new has the tendency
to be carried away by its own en-
thusiasm and momentum. Maybe
that is why an organization which
seeks to perfect democracy has
chosen undemocratic means to ac-
hieve its purpose. The group could
allay many fears of the students by

 

 

  

Ally-Stole Star Team
Selection Of. Squad Ends
Successful Basketball Season

The tregular basketball season is
over for another~year and time for
the annual selection of a mythical
All-star team. The‘WAA basketball
league had an ‘active season this
winter and the choice of a repre-
sentative team was difficult. Mary
Now, president of WAA announces
the following players:

Forwards:

Mary Seymour

Eileen Shoup

Gloria Russo ‘
Sub: Mary Quinn

Guards:

Edna Sweeney
Georgette Dunn
Jayne Cheney

Sub: Wilma Diehl

a unanimous selection. Shoupie,
KD’s passing and shooting ace, kept
opposing players guessing her every
performance. No one questioned
the all-round ability of Newman’s
star, Gloria Russo. Her shooting
and floorwork are beyond compare.
Quinn, during her ﬁrst year on the
Gamma Kap squad, dribbled and
moved around with the ease and
skill of a player very much at home
on the WAA court.

Edna Sweeney, Psi Gam’s bomb-
shell, and unanimous choice as best
guard, incurred the. admiration of
players and spectators alike for her
smooth perfromance. BZ's repre—
sentative, Dunn, deserves praise not
only for her superb playing, but also
for her fine sense of sportsmanship.
Cheney was’ Gamma Kap’s “fight-
inest” player this season, intercept-
ing passes. taking the ball off the
backboard, spurring the team to
league leadership. Wilma Diehl,
frosh star and all-round good sport
rounds out the selection of a power-
ful squad.

As is well known to all spectators
of WAA basketball this year. these
girls gave excellent performances
and each was a spark-plug for her
teammates. The line-up picked this
year could easily hold its own with
any team seen in these parts.

Softball Progressing;
Senion To Form Team

Once again softball season has
started with an enthusiastic and
somewhat damp beginning. The
rain has put a damper on softball
activities, but not on the spirit of
the players.

Monday Wednesday and Friday
practices have been well attended
according to Shoup and Baker sport
captains. There is. however, one
flaw in the picture of vim, vitality
and enthusiasm—the decided lack
of Juniors and Seniors. In fact. to
date, there has been 2 Juniors and
no Seniors at all. Since the Seniors
are scheduled to play '48 next week
they must form a team. Those in-
terested please contact Bostwick.

Some of the freshmen look like
veterans in the field. Either Young
or Boyington on first look as good
as some of the old timers. Diehl.
Diffen, Magginis, Valentine, Dolley,
Tilden and Archido are all excellent
in their respective positions.

or course, the Sophs are living
up to their athletic reputation.
Margo. Baker. Wakin, and Swee~
noy of lost years fame are still on
the ball. Newcomers Nielsen, Ray-
mond. Lucsok and O'Grady are
powerful hitters and have been
coming out regularly.

throwing off its aspects of a secret
society and by broadening its pro-
visions for membership, From a
practical standpoint, even. the pres-
cnt committee and sub-committee
set-up appears inadequate to hon-
dlc the endless ramifications in the
fields of labor, economics. social
welfare. etc. that will arise in such
work.

Above all. should, the student
body he asked to support a self-
appointed council. when there are
existing organizations scokin the
some ends that are represen ative
of the students?

 

Thrills, Suspense '
During Contest

The Sophomores chalked up an-
other athletic triumph Wednesday
evening as they won three out of
ﬁve races at the Public Bath and
copped two rivalry points alloted to
the swim meet. The ﬁnal result
came as a surprise to many who
favored ’48 to win.

Fresh Win Relay

The frosh exhibited their strength
in the ﬂirst race, a speed relay
matching Pat Tilden and Sue
O’Connell against Connie, Lessler
and Janet Inglehart. The whistle
blew. the meet was on, and Tilden.
was off to a good start. She led
Lessler down the pool and on the
return trip, O‘Connell kept the
fresh lead, ﬁnishing a length ahead
of Inglehart. The freshmen team
really looked promising, .

Most Exciting Race

Conﬁdently, ’48 prepared for the
second race which was another re—
lay involving the transportation of
a lighted candle. Victory depended
upon a fast side stroke and excellent
kick control to avoid splashing the
candle. Jane Mills and Barbara
Harris started off in the most ex-
citing race of the evening. As Mills
gradually increased her lead the
Sophomores hopes rose; but their
hearts stopped. when in transfer-
ring the candle to Inglehart, the
flame went out. While it was being
relighted Harris came in and Fledlcr
started down the last lap for the
frosh. Her candle lit, Inglehart
resumed the race and excitement
rose as she overtook her opponeni
at the halfway mark. They were
even for a few seconds. and then
in a burst of speed. Inglehart drew
away and won the race by inches.

A Lost Shoe

The third race saw Jean Davidson
and Barbara Harris donning extra
clothes for the plunge. The first
one to swim to the other side, shed
their outer clothing, toss it up on
the tile and return, would be
awarded the race. Harris got off to a
better start, while Davidson seemed
to be having a little difficulty.
However, in her haste, Harris lost
one of her shoes and while she was
still trying to retrieve it. Davidson
returned to the starting point and
won the second race for the Sopho-
mores.

Soplis Win Third

To swim the length of the pool
reading the State College NEWS.I
was the next obstacle race. and the
Sophs. matched Inglehart. against
Ruth Osborne. Inglehau’s steady
up and down kick proved stronger
than Osborne’s scissors and she won
by a wide margin.

Fresh Show Speed

The Sophomores had won the re-
quired three but it was decided to
run off the fifth race anyway.
O'Connell, Osborne and Tilden
swam for the frosh. and Lessler,
Mills and Davidson for the Sophs.
The race was for one length and
would be credited to the ﬁrst team
to be completed on the other end.
Here again the frosh displayed their
superiority in free style speed.
O‘Connell. Osborne. and Tilden
placed first. second and third. giving
the race to the freshmen.

Softball. Field Stunts Left

The swim moot completed, only
softball and fileld stunts remain on
the rivalry sports calendar and
these total ten points. The stunts
are scheduled for May 10. and notice
of the softball game will be posted
on the class bulletin boards.

Merrily We Ride Along

In the spring, the thoughts of
some turn to horse-back riding. So
for about 13 girls have received
enough bruises to obtain credit in
riding.

Experienced riders are allowed to
go as they please, beginners are un~
dcr the cure of Andy. who knowa
his job and has his students riding
to music and doing formations.
Some People

And, of course, there arc the
over—enthusiastics. like acrobatic
Thomas who did a double flip over
her horse's head. ,

But riding is a. great sport. Cap-
tains 01011in and Kochu invite all
interested or prospective people to
come out Saturday mornings and
join them in a brisk ride.

   

 

Students Respond
Wholehearfedly
To MAA Plea

The general subscription for op-
erating funds in the man-power
drive was a great success. When the
take had been tabulated, the col-
lectors found that State had shelled-
out to the tune of $51.00. This repre-
sents roughly a nickel from each
person in the student body, but to
those who contributed $4.50 in quart-
ers a special commendation is con-
veyed. Thanks, however, goes to all
those who chipped-in, no matter how
small the offering. If the spirit
shown in this initial effort is kept
up, there is no reason to fear that
there will be poor support for the
team.

Letters Sent

The first item bought by the fund
was $2000 worth of stamped ,enve-
lopes. With these the fellows sent
out the plea to alumni all over the
state. This letter outlined what is
being planned in the way of ath-
letics, the advantages offered by
State, and what was expected of
them. This method will bring the
campaign even closer to prospective
freshmen. It will also reawaken the
grads interest in the doings of their
Alma Mater.

To follow up the letter to the
alumni each man who already has
applied will receive a personal let-
ter from one of the men in State.
As more names are received. more
letters will be sent. It is hoped that
the personal approach will draw
even more students from towns al-
ready contributing. To augment
the mailing list now in the hands
of the men it would be appreciated
if each student in the college would
turn in names of athletes that they
personally know.

The ﬁnal plea is that the student
body will do vigorous recruiting on
its own over the summer vacation.

New York Teams

League Favorites

Last year we went way out on a
limb to predict; the outcome of the
major league baseball. Not only did
we forecast the winner. but we even
went so far as to list the teams in
the numerical order in which we
expected them to finish.

The American league really played
as dirt. Detroit, whom we had pu
in fifth position ended up on top
of the league. New York, our boys,
finished up in third place. The
Boston team which We had delegat—
ed to the cellar put forth a spirited
drive which landed them right ur
with the Big 4.

The National league was a little
more responsive to our suggestions.
Right there on top at the end of
the season just as We had predicted.
were the St. Louis Cardinals.

But, practice makes perfect, they
say. so rather than being overcome
by our failure last year. we go out
again on our limb. This time we
take the New York club in each
league. The Yankees have the mast
patent pitching staff and still have
some of their old power left. The
Giants seem to have the strongest
team in the National.

So for our boys have been doing
fine. The Giants took their fourth
stl'illllllt Wednesday while the Yun-
koos. tho sumo day. took the
nwusurc of the Athletics.

In Close Game

Woodwoilh's Loss; 11-10
Brophy's Bolling Slots

Bouncing back from their twin
shellacking two weeks before, Siena
nosed out a fighting State College
team 11-10 last Sunday afternoon.
The scene of the game was changed
from the seclusion of the Dorm Field
to the wind-swept heights of Bever-
wyck Park. It must have’ been the
wide open spaces that upset the con-
trol of the usually steady Frank
Woodworth. Whatever it was, his
pin-point hurling, which had held
Siena to two runs the last time out,
deserted him, and as a result he
was hit freely. He wasn’t wild to
the extent that the siena boys were
presented with a flock of walks, it
just meant that he had to throw fast
pitches to get the ball over the plate.
Siona Opens Scoring ~

Siena was off to a flying start in
the very ﬁrst inning. The combina-
tion of a walk. two errors and two
hits was good enough for three runs.
They made. it 4-0 in the second inn-
ing when Jones was safe on an error,
stole second, and scored on Gold-
blatt’s long single to right.

State narrowed the margin in
their half of the second. Woodworth
walked, went to third on a wild
pitch, and scored on Keen’s hit.

Siena made it 6-1 in the third
when they scored twice on four solid
hits. State came back for one in the
third, but they soared into the lead
in the ﬁfth. When HI.“ smoke had.
cleareci from the barrage of base hits
five State runs had dented the rub-
ber and State was leading 7-6. The
big blow of the inning was when
Brophy drove one of Fidelle's fast
balls into Partridge Street for a
home run. No one was on base when
Jim delivered his hit.

State’s lead lasted until the sixth
frame when two more Siena runs
were scored. They added another
brace in the ninth to give them an
imposing 10-7 lead. State made its
last bid in the bottom half of the
ninth when it tied up the score with
three runs. Brophy again provided
the punch with a two run single.

Siena won the game in the top
half of the tenth stanza. A walk
and two hits provided them with the
necessary margin of victory. State
went down in order in the last half
of the tenth and also went down to
their initial defeat of the year.

Off the Cuff

State again showed its most glar-
ing deflect—sloppy ﬁelding. The boys
are hitting well, but when they get
out on the ﬁeld they seem to lose
a lot of their polish. A little more
practice would make a formidable
team out of them. Siena looked bet-
ter than before. hitting when it
counted and taking advantage of
every break. The next game, when it
comes, promises to be good.

Our boys have it in them but per—
haps a little more encouragement
from the female population at State
would spur them on to future tri-
umphs. Certainly a larger turn-out
especially at the home games would
help the team considerably.

Tapping Tomorrow

It happens every year. Comes May
and State blossoms out with a new
Myskania. For the freshmen, Sophs,
and Seniors, the preceding month
is a time 101' voicing predictions
and prejudices; for the Juniors it
is a silent period to be broken only
by an occasional click of the “bited”
nail and a now—and-then release of
the bated breath.

This year, tapping of the new
Myskania will remind us of the
changes that have taken place in
the past year. Perhaps the great-
est change is the abandoning of the
caps and gowns except on special
occasions. However, there is one
thing that “’4” never change as long
us lvlyskunia exists—the group of
Juniors that are tapped.

'i'l'iCi'c is always a beauty, brains,
brawn combination Now; a bomb-
shell Cooper and a pair of capable
pl'csidentsuGarfnll and Smith. The
finer arts are represented by the
fine—~Alden. Rooth. and Sprengcr,
while a Hoyeslip and a Bostwick are
around to boost inter—faith rela-
tions. Then, on the literary side,
there‘s always a versatile Marsh, a
smiling Gorg. and a “where did you
get those dimples. Dot" Meyers.

The class of '45 has had a record-
brcaking Mysknnla. For the first
time in its history, Myskania was
composed of all womenw one dozen
daisies. They've performed under
revised power and duties, but it
hasn't dampened their spirit. We
all remember the dungaroc-nnd-
sweat-shirt-clad twelve selling
chances on a bond.

Tomorrow. they’ll march from the
stage in the traditional way to tap
the thirtieth Myskanin. How many?
Bctwccn eight and thirteen. Pop-
ular opinion holds that there will be
thirteen this year. It is always a
new and wonderful experience for
the freshmen, but the uppcrclass-
men are usually more interested in
who will make up the new "select
few."

Every year. the decision is ques—
tioncd and this your will not be an
oxcoption. Moving-Up Day is a day
for the bitter and the joyful, never
for the indifferent. 'I‘hc balcony
will be jammed with mothers, all
with the some question, "Will my son
or daughter . . . i’”

There is another question which
no one thinks of. “Do these people
correspond with the usual leaders
with their beauty. etc?" 0 well,
there must be one dimple in the
Junior class!

V-E Day Herél
Nazi Downfall
Hearlens Wor

Like the rest of the world, State
students wept, prayed and cele-
brated when Nazi Germany uncon-
ditional surrender was announced
to all the Allies in all the fronts
May 7. 1945. Official “Victory in
Europe Day” waited only for con-
firmation at 9 A.M., May 8, as the
Big Three leaders simultaneously
spoke to their people. The procla-
mations declared history's most tra-
gic conflict at a victorious end.

News of Surrender

In the little red schoolhouse some-
where in France, the headquarters
of General Eisenhower, the German
,(iommander Foertch surrendered
unconditionally to the Allies at 2:41
A.M. French time and 8:49 P.M.
EWT. General Eisenhower's Chief
of Staff Lt. General Smith signed
the surrender with the French and
Russians. “Fighting Ike" Eisenhow-
er, who was not present at the sign-
ing, later asked the German gener-
als who were brought before him
if they understood the terms of
unconditional surrender. The ene-
my's answer was, “Yes.” So the na-
tion, that st: ted the purge of
blitzes, V-bombs and U-boat war-
fare when they attacked Poland and
caused world disorder for five years,
eight months and six days, has
gone down to defeat.

America greeted the uncondi-
tional surrender with a variety
of emotions sweeping from coast
to coast. New York city’s reaction
was a cascade of waste paper from
buildings while people sang and
shouted in the streets and publicly
prayed.

Upstate New York welcomed the
news with civic celebrations and
prayers of Thanksgiving.

State's First Reaction

State students, at first uncertain,
walked about in a state of expect-
ancy or overflowed the News Office
listening to the latest news flashes
to confirm the rumors. News came
from all sources and truth came to
the fore. Military victory in Europe
was certain. The V-E Day Service,
orangod by Mysknnia. was held at
9 A.M. on May 8 as the only official
celebration. Classes continued and
the College remained in session.

The United Nations conference,
accepting Germany’s surrender
with calm rejoicing, continued bus-
iness conferences as usqu in this
momentous time of Nazi surrender,
but on the lips of every delegate was
the happy word that “now it's over
in Europe."
