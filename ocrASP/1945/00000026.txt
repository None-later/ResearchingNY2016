performance of the three one-act
plays, however, proved, that rumors
are only rumors. From any seat in
the house, they are a delightful af-

The first offering was directed by

'.Shirley Gross,’ ’47, and was a tri-

angle drama concerning an emin-
ent surgeon, his wife, and a pa-
tient-friend, portrayed, in order, by
Joseph Palevsky, 1’48, Mary Carey,
’47. and Roger Nielsen. ’48. As far
as the individual work goes, Palev-
sky turned in the best piece of act-
ing, warming up after an unsteady
beginning. His voice and gestures
seem-2d, to mature with the pace
of the play, and I think character
parts will become him in forthcoms
ing productions. Nielsen also shOWs
promise, although he was a bit un-
sure of himself in this, his first
dramatic attempt. Carey was at
her best in the telegram scene, and
seems to indicate that more work
lies ahead, with a bit more polish,
althoughshe may be limited in
ange. ‘

and play. another heavy, set in a

The ' actual ‘

 

has a road ahead other in college
'_eatricals as soon as she loosens
;-r gestures and becomes easier on
the stage. The only unfortunate
thin-r about the play was the play
itself. It is an extremely wordy
bit. and out of date, both being dif-
ficult to rise above; the cast did
well considering these obstacles.
The extreme pleasure of the critic
lies. however, in the last perform-
ance of the evening. a comedy
drama directed by Marianne Davis,
’46. It was with the lovely feeling
of relaxation that the entire audi-

ence. I am sure, allowed itself to.

be swept under a haze of theatre.
To Mary Ellen Diener, ’47, and
Gloria Jaifer, ’48, go the acting
laurels ‘ of this season at State.
Diener, for her amazing gift of be-
ing able to become a decorative
part of a chair, with no effort at
all; if she dived into one. it would
still bewith an easy. graceful mo-
tion. Jafl’er, because of her inex-
plicable voice and inflection. and
her facial mobility. Add to these
their beautiful sense of comedy
timing, and you have actresses. Too
many superlatives? Ah, they’re so
enjoyable.

I’m looking forward to the next
season of the College Playhouse.
There has come to State this year
a good lot of theatre material that
A.E.F. and the Playhouse produc-
tion classes can mold. Last Tues-
day night was the beginning of
something that promises to have no
end. in acting and directing.

But. after all. as the Great Lady
said not so long ago. “You were my
chicks.”

This is the legacy of Adolph Hit-
ler:

A war which exhausted all the
superlatives in the vocabulary of
horror.

A war in which more than 40.-
000.000 people were killed.

A war which left no corner of
peace in this agonized globe.

Twelve years which transformed
the German nation into worshippers
of cruelty. bestiality. greed and ir-
resistible conquest.

Twelve years in which knowledge
and humanity were debased and ob-
literated.

Twolve years in which the doc-
trine of racial superiority poured
thru the life blood of a people. nul-
lifying the small wisdom men have
gained in their attempts at living
with other men.

An era which began with the eco-
nomic restrictions and gradual des-
truction of Europe‘s Jews——

And ended in Buchenwaid. Maid-
enek. Dachau and Belsen, whose fur-
naces. gas chambers. mass graves
made no distinction between Jews.
Poles. Americans. French, Russians,
English or Germans.

An era in which. as Roosevelt
taught the Americans. this world
could not survive half-slave and
half‘frcc.

When Adolph Hitler was clcctcd
vice-chmicellor of (icrnn‘uiy. the
country was economically shaky:
worldwide panic and (he debiliiuiion

There is not one hint of eompunc-

one group has emerged as responsi-
ble leaders of a native, iillllellzl

movement. We are being forced.
says Willi Frischauer in the New
York Times, to use “experienced
Nazi administrators and experts."
because not “enough conﬁrmed an-
ti-Nazis“ can be found “to carry
out their orders, to deal with the
mass of German people, to under-
take vitai repairs to sewers and
power plants and to organize food
distribution. sort out the popula-
tion and regulate traffic."

This is part of Hitler's legacy
to a world that has much to do to
kill the Nazi legend. the memory
of the Nazi blood-bath. The anti-
Nuzis are non-existent. bodies or
minds crushed. Not until we take
up our task of governing Germany
will the full implications of this hit
the world.

paper and "trying toke‘ep up your'mark's. on
the side, one is apt, to feel Somewhat relieved
to know that there will be no more deadlines
to meet, no more hasty trips to printer when
the copy becomes lost, and no more worry
about either too much news or not enough.
Curiously enough, however, the feeling of
relief is somewhat overshadowed by a sense
of nostalgia, for printer’s ink, headlines, and
copy paper are not easily erased from one’s
Imindt. They move, instead, it seems to the
ear .

A year of a college newspaper must needs
record once more the same things which have
filled the columns many times in preceding
years. Campus Day, Activities Day, elec-
tions, Moving-Up Day are landmarks in the
college year, and as such ﬁnd space in the
college newspaper. There are other things

however, which make up a college, namely

students and the spirit with which those stu-
dents respond to a college program. It is the
duty of the newspaper to record these in the
same manner in which it records the already
established events. Only in this way can it
completely serve the student body.

.This has been our aim this year. We have
tried to present the week at State College in
four pages every Friday. For us, it was more
than a ﬁrst and second story for the front
page and a box for third. It was a panorama
of college life for the week. Twenty-eight
issues togther make up the college year of
1944-45. If you feel that we have presented
college life and spirit to you adequately, we
have succeeded, if not, we have failed.

Next week, a new News Board will assume
the responsibility of the paper for another
year. There may be a new masthead, but the
policy of the News remains the same. A stu-
dent conceived and organized newspaper, it
remains solely a student organ. The person
who tries out for the News learns this as
thoroughly as he learns how to write stories
and headlines. We never forget it, and it is
your duty not to let us.

Voice OF The People

To the Editor: .

The intensity of the argument in assembly
concerning the Inter-Group council certainly
indicates that the student body is on its
toes. On the other hand the very existence
of this Council is evidence that our leaders
aren’t asleep at the switch, either.

I feel that this group is representative of
the student association, inasmuch as the
members are those of us who have already
proved themselves in the other organizations
and offices of the college. Furthermore.
membership is open to every interested stu-
( out.

For the benefit of those who complain of
the “secret beginning" of the Committee.
may 1 point that the group followud flic ud—

To date, there have been pre-
sented seven programs in the “Big
8" series. The first of these was
in Page Hall on October 28. a musi-
cal minstrel show sponsored by the
Class of ‘45. Its “Five Chocolate
Drops” and “Mr. Gallagher and Mr.
Sheehan" acts spurred the show to
its final goal of $219.50. -

This was followed, on November
18, by the Faculty “Big 8." This af—
fair made $178.

Christmas time was the season

for the third “Big 8” under the
joint sponsorship of Student Chris-
tian Association, Newman Club. and
Hillel. The “Toy Shop” with its
Raggedy Ann and Raggedy Andy
in conjunction with Chanukah Ser-
vice earned $126.
' Number four of the series was the
“State Fair," in which were repre-
sented all of the group houses on
campus. The varied attractions and
originality presented here netted
$445.50. 1, I

The most recent event of the “Big
8” program is the Intersorority af-
fair. This was a social evening
composed of bridge playing and
dancing with an orchestra. Its re-
ceipts totaled $155.80.

These amounts totaled to $1,124.60.
but complete results have not been
tabulated, as both Sophomore and
freshman “Big 8" returns are to be
withheld until after Moving-Up
Day. and the Junior class “Big 8’
has not taken place. Betty .1. Mc-
Grath. '46. chairman of the “Big 8",
estimates the filial results at $1,800
as a. minimum.

Myskania To Serve Tea
Ai Moving-Up Day SoCiaI

An innovation in the regular Mov-
ing-Up Day program will be the tea
given by Myskania for parents and
friends of State College students in
the Richardson Lounge from 3-5
PM. on May 11.

It was felt that the Moving-Up
Day programs of previous years were
not complete in that there was no
scheduled program between the
morning activities and the program
in the later evening. ,

This year the Lounge will be open
to all parents and friends of stu-
dents attending the Moving-Up Day
exercises. Myskania will preside over
introductions to faculty and other
students. and there will be bridge,
refreshments and dancing.

Millie and State have things in
common and the main thing, at the
moment. is lack of time. How can
a person‘s schedule be so full?
There seem to be a million things
to do before graduation in the way
of social activities. sports, music,
dramatics and even a little school
work.

If you happen to see Milnites
tearing their hair, it is only because
they are frantically trying to finish
up plans for our “big-time" QTSA
formal.

Milncs’ nightengales have joined
forces under the direction of Miss
Gwendolyn Brown, our music direc-
tor. They are rehearsing day in
and day out for the Spring Concert
which takes place on the eventful
evening of May 18. Everyone is in-
vltcd.

\Vc haven’t quite gotten as far as
Shakespcor in dramatics. but the
gals of Quin and Sigma Literary
Societies: are alolwing their talents
to come to the public eye in “Let‘s

their latest hit production “Through

ness, this performance hits an all-
time high for originality, unique
arrangements and master sets.

Mike, the creator and director of
this Broadway production, staged
and planned the entire show.

Do you enjoy mystifying experi-
ments—tests for reactions, temper-
ament. color and‘character? (No
this isn’t Chem .18) But experiment
is the exceptional characteristic of
“Through the Years." Last year the
Juniors made their ﬁrst new test
with “Till We Meet Again.” This
year we see them delving into deep-
er and more complex stunts of en-
tertainment. Original lyrics and
music. modern dancing, and color-
ful sets accentuate this Junior per-
formance. Toni O’Brien, instigator
of all Junior choruses, oversees the
music and dance compositions
while Muriel Navy, State’s pugna-
cious pianist, will bring out their
rhythm tempos.

To really put over an A-1 per-

Even a prohibition cafe comesin
for Its" share in” set portraits. The
Juniors expand a little at Coney Is-
land. where we glimpse blissful
bathing beauties, umbriago umbrel-
las and that charmin' chanter, Syl-
via Trop, singing “By the Sea."

A few of the lllutrious Junior
soloists make their debut in this
musical revue. Agnes Young will
introduce Mike's original number
"Now and Then." while Sue Yager's
renditions, "Now" and “Love Walk-
ed In" will please even the balcony-
last row center. But the biggest hit
of the evening will bring to light
the unknown but well heralded vir-
tuoso in her supreme parody of that
soul stirring selection “Daisy.”

This unusual study of American
music and dance will be one of real
tribute to the Junior class. A chron-
ological study of vaudeville, it in-
cludes no dialogue, scenic and set
changes occur within themselves.
The modern choreographic number
is built entirely around a sky-
scraper theme. bringing out the
Junior's desire to excel in this ﬁnal
Big 8.

If this Big 8 you would visit they‘ll
guarantee you’ll crow and coo.
