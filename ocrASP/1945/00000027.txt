Not Again

But our apologies are not yet
complete. Last week the News
copy was lost again. With a dead-
line only an hour away. we were
forced to compose a story on Major
League baseball, originally written
by George Hess—which reporter was
. nowhere to be found at the moment.
We uncovered one person who knew
the winner of last year’s American
League and with that to go on, plus
the invaluable assistance of the
Sports page of the Times, We bat-
ted out what will probably go down
in history as the worst news story
ever written. Added to this, we
find that Detroit did not top the
National League. If any St. Louis
Brown fans were insulted by_ last
week’s issue, we include them on
our list of P'I'AT'.

‘People To Apologize To.

Spring

This is the time of year when
every respectable Senior is seen to
wipe away a furtive tear at the
mere mention of Moving-Up Day or
graduation. It's the time of year
when things you’ve known for four
years suddenly seem new and you
feel as if there is no time to have
your fill of seeing them. Some
friends you have made you know
you might never see again and you
try to crowd the lifetime of them
you may miss into a few fleeting
weeks that remain.

But this is a time, too, of a pull
in the other direction. College is a
phase of life much as childhood and
adolescence» are. And, like them, its
passing closes the door on one
world, but at the same time opens
another on a broader, wider world.
Mixed with the reluctance to leave
the old. is the desire to taste the
new. 0n the adjustment the indivi-
dual makes between these two
forces, rests his future happiness
.and contentment.

’45 is the war-time class, the
last class which remembers State
before she lived in the shadow of
war. We’re the solemn-faced kids
who listened to a firm but sad voice
announce that the United States
was at war. Now we are the class
that graduates on the threshhold
of peace. We graduate knowing
that part of us—the part of us that
marched off to battle—will be re-
turning soon to resume its place.
We are happy knowing this.

also in the athletic world which will

Good Start

Starting off with a hang, the first
week they were at state, Nora Gia-
velli signed up for the Tennis tour-
nament. Little did she know that it
was the men’s tourney she had let,
herself L in for. MAA officials
searched frantically in the books
but there was no rule against girls
entering—it was just that no one
had ever tried it before. Nora dis-
tinguished herself in the tourney,
reaching the semi-finals before she
was defeated — by‘ another '45’er,
Norm Finer. Fran Mullin, also of
the illustrious class, walked off with
the final honors in the tournament.

The fresh made a clean sweep of
the tennis court that year, with Flo
Garfall earning the crown in the
Women’s division. By a set of cir-
cumstances—including the weather,
broken fingers, etc., Flo still has the
cup as no tournament has been
completed since 1941.

’45 Lost But

As so many other freshman
classes, ’45 lost rivalry, but in‘some
of the individual encounters, they
came off very well. Girls' basket-
ball was the heartbreaker. The frosh
took the first game, but a two-point
victory for the Sophs in the second
put them back in the running and
in a hectic final game they came

Rivalry Classes
Race For Points

Women’s and men’s rivalry con-
tests this week will end the Rivalry
sports program for the year. Seven
points are involved and may be de-
cisive in the final results.

Wednesday afternoon the wo-
men’s contest took place at 4:30
on the ﬁeld in front of the college.
Features were a three-legged race.
straight relay race, sack race, suit-
case race and team relay races each
carrying one rivalry point.

The frosh participating were:
Ginny Young, Barbara Harris, Ruth
Osborne, Sheila Maginess, Scoop
Gilbert, Sue O'Connell and Mary
Quinn. Young and Harris took
part in the suitcase race, Osborne
and Maginess in the relay race.

The sophomores were represented
by Edna Sweeney, Martha Dunlay,
Gloria Baker, Louise Rollema,
Marge O’Grady, Vivian Nielsen,
Betty Rose Hilt and Ann Ma-
strangelo.

In the men's division. the events
consisted of accuracy in baseball
throwing, distance in hitting and
speed in running bases. Frosh fel-
lows were: Jim Brophy, John Boiles,
Sparky Vaughn, Bruce Hansen, Bill
Baldwin. Ray Cocuzzi, Rodney
Felder and John Hammond.

Representing the Sophs were:
Frank Woodworth, Hal Weber, Jim
Whytock, Gene ‘McCarthy and Bill
Mallory.

 

Personally, we give the nod to:
Sullivan. Casey, Dunn, Griffin. Mc-
Grath, O’Neil, Berbrich, Miner,
Cronin, Buetow, Brinkman, Hamil-

'46 didn't have a'chance in the
athletic world againstthe might of
’45. The blue devils Were smother-
ed in football as the Soph men
ramped off with a 27-6 victory tuck-
ed away. The men's basketball was
just as decisive. The 49-29 score is
sufficient evidence of that fact. The
girls, too, made a clean sweep in
their department. Points for bas-
ketball were earned by a 36-32 win
in the first game—an exciting over-
time aﬂair—and by a decisive 33-
25 score in the second. Softball fell
to the Sophs in an easy 35-25 win.
It was‘Dave Griffin, ’45, who proved
to be the fastest man at State—on
the track, of course—in a race that
was the talk of the college for
weeks. .

As Juniors, ’45 continued to be
sparkplugs in WAA. They watched
over the fresh at camp, got point-
ers on hockey from Mary Now, just
returned from hockey camp. Then
there was the girls’ football inter-
lude with Juniors sparkplugging
many of the teams. At a Camp
Johnston week-end a group of them
aided the cause of WAA. 'Sander-
son was behind the Mixed basket-
ball game, in which the gals were
massacred but had a swell time
anyway.

The infirmities of old age and
the trials of practice teaching have
taken their toll on the Seniors but
they have kept up their interest
and skill in WAA. They have been
the mainstays of many a basketball
and bowling team.

’45 may have lost its men, its
youth and its carefree attitude but
its “pep and drive” are still in
evidence.

Fros'h Take Softball,-
Add To Rivalry Tally

Sophs Bow To Frosh, 13-1
In Exciting Scoring Spree

A determined freshmen squad took
the held Thursday afternoon and
finally broke the Sophomore winn-
ing streak by triumphing in the
rivalry softball game 13-7.

Peg Daly starred as the frosh
pitcher. In the ﬁrst inning Jean
Valentine, Lydia Boynton and Pat
Tilden brought in runs for ’48, but
the Sophs were unable to connect
with Daly's slow, steady ball and
the second frame opened 3-0 in favor
of the freshmen.

The next inning was one of sloppy
ﬁelding for the Sophomores but nei-
th'er team made any runs and at the
top half of the third the frosh still
held their lead. Forty-seven struck
out again and as the possibility of a
shut-out game loomed the freshmen
sought a more decided victory. The
daffy cheering section roared their
delight as Valentine, Shapiro, Boyn-
ton, Tilden, Diehl, Lengyel, Young
and Daly all come home in the bot-
tom of the third and the score was
11-0.

The Sophomores thwarted ’48’s
hope for a ciphered game when
Sweeney and Margot came home in
the fourth. But the frosh evened up
their lead bringing Young and Daly
in and the last inning opened 13-2
for. the freshmen.

The Gremlins now seemed to ﬁnd
Daly‘s pitch and made a final valient
try to even up the score. Sue Camp-
bell, Edna Sweeney, Jean Davidson
( a triple), Vivien Nielson and Ber-
tha Wakin completed the diamond
and the game closed 13-7.

 '  a

" Have you ever heard of Camp.-
beil? No? V _ _
'ca‘use not many people have heard
of it. The same. can’t be, said tho'
for its star resident and this week's
TNT’er — Gloria Russo. Campbell
declared a holiday and went into

mourning when she left. You know I

one person in a town of 200 means
a lot. There she participated in all
the' major sports offered in the
high schoolebasketball, softball and
track. Track, however. should not
be taken to mean just track — at
Campbell it was all inclusive, and
relays, dashes, broad jumps and
ingh jumps, came under this head-
ng.

Gremlin Gain

“One man’s loss is another’s
gain,” they say and Russo was def-
initely a gain for the Gremlins. In
her freshman year, she obtained
credit in three sports—softball, bas-
ketball and hiking. She took part
in rivalry swimming, basketball,
softball and track events. Early her
skill in basketball was noted and it
was undoubtedly one of the main
factors in helping ’47 win rivalry
basketball last year against some of
’46's seasoned players. She also
participated in swimming and ping
pong not receiving credit, however,
in either of these sports.

In her second year, Russo was ap-
pointed co-captain of WAA swim-
ming and captain of the rivalry
swimming team (which won inci-
dentally). She obtained credit in
four more sports — ping pong,
hockey, life-saving and again the
old stand-by, basketball. Most of
her fame this year, has come as a
result of this sport. She was in the
line-up of Sophs who played in the
rivalry game this year. She came
to the aid of the Gremlins in both
games with 19 and 17 points
All State Forward

No one can deny that she was
one of the mainstays on Newman
Hall’s squad this year. And didn’t
they end. up in the big three of bas-
ketball? Recognition of her out-
standing playing was awarded last
week. when she was chosen as a.
forward on the All-State Star bas-
ketball team.

Turning to her swimming record,
we find that she took part in the
rivalry swim meet last year, win-
ning one of the novelty races. This
year, she went out for live-saving,
obtaining a life-saving certificate as
well as enough hours to receive
credit.

Just before Easter vacation,
something happened to her back,
which, unless some quick mending
takes place, will prevent her from
participating in any more sports,
this year or next. This would not
only be a loss to the class but to
State as well. A good all-around
sport is always missed. Somehow
we feel tho', that this is not the
end of her spectacular sports ca-
reer. Good mending Russo!

ALBANY, NEW YORK, FRIDAY, MAY, 11 1945

VOL. xxrx no. 2'5

 

Myskania Taps Thirteen

 

Weinberg Wins
Vice Presidency,

O'Brien Secretary

By a substantial majority of the
votes cast in last Friday’s election
Helen Slack Shure gained the office
of President of Student Association
for next year. Out of a, total of
818 votes cast, Mrs. Shure gained
an easy margin for herself on the
first distribution, polling 457 votes,
47 votes over the quota.

Robert Sullivan, runner-up in the
race with a total of 279 votes, failed
to equal his record of last year
when he captured the vice-presi-
dency of Student Association by ap-
proximately the same margin that
Mrs. Shure carried this year. James
Crandall, the third candidate, failed
to even show in the election, trail-
ing Mr. Sullivan by 198 votes.
Weinberg On Third

The Vice-Presidency election was
more hotly contested, the main con-
test being between Mr. Lashinsky
and Mr. Weinberg. Weinberg’s
majority in the third and last dis—
tribution was only 8 votes. Lorna
Kunz and Gertrude Smith both
drew small totals.

O'Brien Wins Easily

The Secretarial race narrowed
down to two candidates due to the
previous preferences of both Justine
Maloney and Gloria Gilbert for
other offices. Jane O’Brien easily
won over her opponent. Hilda Field-
er, piling up a 297 vote majority.

The Grand Marshall election was
never long in doubt as Betty Ham-
ilton took the lead on the first dis-
tribution and reached the quota on
the third distribution. Her nearest
competitor was Marianne Davis.
Casey Is Songlcadcr

Other Student Association elec-
tions resulted in the victory of Peg-
gy Casey as Songieader and Betty
Brennan, Mary Carey, Rita Cole-
man and Genevieve Sabatini as
Cheerleaders. In explanation of
the last distribution for the Song-
leuder election, it will be noted that
Miss Casey needed only a few votes
to reach the quota of 410 so that
only enough of Mary 'I‘elian's votes
were distributed until Miss Casey
got the required total.

The newly elected members of
the Student Board of Finance for
next year are Judith Geroisky,
Gloria McFerran. Betty J. McGi'ath
and Joseph Paicvsky from the class
of 1946; Justine Maloney and Trudy
Smith from the class of 1947.

New members of the Student
Union board are Katherine Ken-
dall, and Jean Whitney of the class
of 1949 and Carol Berg and William
Mallory of the Class of 1947.

year will consist of the following

ciation officers and the class presi-
dents: Class of 1940, Eileen Moody,
