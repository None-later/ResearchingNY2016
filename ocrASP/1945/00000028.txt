Future Fresh Invade Draper
To Face Fatetul Interviews

Thirty anxious faces with
searching eyes were guided
through State’s corridors to fate-
ful interviews held from Mon-
day ’ti1 Friday for prospective
49'ers from local high schools.

The greatest majority for one
field are going all out for plenty
of work—Math majors. However.
the newcomers also promise to
bring talent to every extra-cur-
ricular activity.

Favorite comments from the
interviewees are: “I never ex-
pected a State school to be so
nice, a place where students have
fun." or, “These girls don’t look
like schoolteachers.”

 

 

 

Collegiate Press

Classifies News
As First Class

The Associated Collegiate Press
has announced that the S'rATn COL-
LnGt: News for the year 1944-45 has
received a first class rating in the
thirty-second All-American Critical
Review of college publications. In
its class there are nineteen other
papers to attain a first class rating
which is second only to the All-
Amcrican rating reached by nine
papers of its class.

The purpose of the critical serv-
ice of the Associated Collegiate
Press is to analyze and rate every
college publication] which is entered
in the yearly contest. Every college
staff knows by its rating how its
work stands in relation to the work
of others in its classification. To
make competition as fair as possi-
ble, papers are classified according:
to method of publication. type of
school. enrollment of school and
frequency of issue. This system of
rating attempts to create a year by
your effort to improve the quality
of the school publication.

Fla-Exam Conference

Will Be Inaugurated

Thursday noon. May 31. will mark
the official closing of the 1944-45
school year. according to an an-
nouncement by Dr. Milton G. Nel-
‘son. Dean of the College. During
the afternoon on this day a new
type of student-faculty conferences
will be inaugurated.

In an attempt to cement closer
student-factulty relations. it has
been arranged for faculty members
to be in their offices to give pre-
exnminntion aid to all students who
wish it. This is the first time that
a definite plan has been advanced to
enable students to confer with the
professors who are actually teaching
the courses instead of a single ad-
visor.

The entire faculty will cooperate
with this plan. and students may
obtain a conference any time after
noon by going to the professor‘s
office. No appointment will be nec-
essury.

and directed by Marion Buetow,
with musical direction under Toni
O'Brien. The choral arrangements

Tony Pastor—18854900

Its unity lies in the chronological
sequences placed by time,' since
there is no dialogue in the script.
The first curtain opens on the in-
terior of Tony Pastor’s 585 Variety
Hall in New York, and covers the
years between 1885 and 1900. Solo-
ists in this group are Sue Mont-
gomery. Sylvia Trop, and Bill Mal-
lcry. ’47, on Sweet Rosie O’Grady
and The Great Invention Called
Electric Light, the latter an or-
iginal song written by Miss Bue-
tow.

The second scene is set on the
beach at Coney Island during 1900-
1915, opening with By the Sea, ren-
dered by Miss Trop. Peggy Casey
and Jim Miner couple to do Has
Anybody Here- Seen Kelly?, and
Marianne Davis, backed by the
chorus, will sing And Let the Rest
of the World Go By. From Coney.
the show swings to Times Square
and the war years, 1915 to 1918,
and the representative music of
Give My Regards to Broadwai , For
Me (will My Gal, and Ballln’ the
Jack. Another of Miss Buetow’s
compositions. Forty-Second Street,

numbers.

about a prohibition cafe, 19204932.
Flo Conca, Joan Mather. and the
chorus are featured in arrange-
ments of Bill. Whos’, Pretty Baby,
and My Wonderful One, among
others.

Moving to a balcony terrace off a
Waldorf-Astoria Ballroom, the
mood turns a 1932.19.15 mellow in
Sweet and Lonely, Lone Walked In,
Now. Strange Music, Through the
Years. and New and Then, the last
also by Miss Buctow. The soloists
in this are Sue Yager. Agnes Young.
