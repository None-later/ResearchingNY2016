o‘whether the Com-.

th’ budget fer 194  ,
bjections, weregconeerning the" origin of the group.
V t by some-that theorganization was kept
e etrtoo' long and that it could notbe called
‘ representative of the :Student'Body. Others ob-

.' je‘cted to bringing Inter-group Council into the

open as much. They felt the group Would ac-
complish more if they worked quietly. The whole
j discussion was governed by suspicions until every-

* ‘ ,O'neiseemed to lose track of the whole point.

“Last. Tuesday, Dr.» ,Watt Stewart, chairman of
the faculty representatives on the Inter-Group

,  Council received a wire from Dr. Lloyd Cook, of
,‘L’VOhio State University, interming him that State

was one of 'nine' colleges chosen frOm a group of
80 to participate in a'National experiment for inter-
group education. This selection resulted from inter-
views by Dr. Cook" of eighty colleges throughout
the country and the impression State made with its
already organized inter-group council. Dr. Cook
was very pleased with the work State was doing.
He remarked, “This is one of very few schools that
I have visited where the movement was started by
students instead of faculty members.” He had
already visited the other seventy-nine colleges. We
were selected unanimously and very highly recom-
mended by the National Conference of Christians
and Jews.

This national recognition of the’College must

:prove that the idea of the Interagroup Council can- ‘

not be at fault. Maybe those who objected to the
method were right. Maybe members of Inter-group
'council themselves feel they made a mistake by
bringing it into the open. Maybe they wouldn’t
have been accused of being too secretive, but would
rather have gotten the full cooperation of organiza-
"tions. But even. if they made and recognized the
mistake, it is not too late.

We cannot and must not allow this to defeat our
purpose. Instead, since we have seen where the
'fault is likely to lie, we should take advantage and
avoid further error. Nothing can be accomplished
if we sit back and brood over the method in which
the council was formed. We all say we agree with
the fundamental idea. If this is so, we will not
allow petty grievances to interfere. We will look
for faults in the organization, not for the sake of
~ﬁnding fault, but as a means of bettering the
group. We will make mistakes, sometimes serious,
but our greatest mistakes can btiild our strongest
foundation.

Easy Does it . . .

One of State's perpetual gripes is State‘s teachers.
-Few students can point out a definite fault in
any special teaclter——it’s just general griping. usu—
ally after having received an “ill” in some exam.

tin the other hand, even teachers are lunnan,
and possess faults. They can do little to correct
‘these until they know what they are, but most
students fear to approach them with suggestions.
V'I‘hat varying mark is always lurking in the back-
ground.

'l‘o correct this situation, the Silulent-li‘aculty
Ctnnmittcc of Student (‘onncil has made out a ques-
tionnairc for students to answer anonymously.
The questionnaire covers all phases of teaching 7—
subject matter, methods, and assignments. It will
be distributed in most classes and is to be answered
in regard to the individual teacher.

Despite the fact that this sounds iikc a good
idea, it can be a miserable failure. There are al-
ways the college wits who think humor is the only
thing in iilt‘ . . . the prejudiced ne‘er-do-n’clls who
will take this opportunity to heap scorn on some
pedagogical victim . . . and the ciosml-lnituled profs
who will ascribe any criticism to the ignorance,
rather than the wisdom, of the students.

The committee has already amn-oached the lua-
jority of the faculty and has found them very
cntl‘iusiastic about the proposition. it remains with
the student body to write an “A” or an “if” to this
plan. It is exactly what everyone has been wail-
ing foundries the tcachcr lecture in too low a
\’nit’t‘?‘:\i‘t' the assignments loo long«~--or too short?
,Are then-sis of value as a liicllioti of instruction?
l'l‘he entire list of questions is printed on this page
'of‘ the S'I‘A'l‘lii‘ COleﬁiili . 'EWS.

The questionnaire will he handed out next. week.

you, but it sure

peanut gallery
and gazed with
awe and open

kania. We were
certainly a green
bunch. Remem-
ber when seine of

the Sophs beat us so miserably in
rivalry because we really had a lot
of spirit. We managed to shock
you, didn't we? Oh, our averages!
We had to have something though.
We were the hard luck class as far
as activities went. It seemed that
everything, including frosh camp,
was abolished that year. Who
wouldn‘t be socially minded! We
practically drowned the Soplis at

the faculty Inter-group council,

was notified by Dr. Lloyd Cock. of ‘j‘
Ohio State University that this col-r: ’,

Student Iniatiative I

Dr. Cook explained that State
College was unusual in that; the

idea for organization came entirely

from the students and was not in-
troduced by the administration or
outsiders. Dr. Cook was a guest of
the Inter-Group Council and other
interested faculty members at
a tea last week. ~

Dr. Stewart also announced that‘

an Inter-group workshop would be
field for a week this summer at:
Columbia University. During the
workshop. people of all races and
religions live together in the same
dormitories and attend classes and
lectures. They discuss racial rela—
tions and related problems and try
to achieve practical application of
their beliefs.

Membership on the ~ Committee
will be open to all interested mem-
bers of the student body.
