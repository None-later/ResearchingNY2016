the spirited competition displayed
by the basketball league. The skep-
tics who insist that the main activi-

Poly Sci homework should have been
thoroughly squelched by the appear-
ance of not merely one but often
two, three (and one night live) said
bridge players in the Page Hall gym.
The contest thundered to a close
“ amidstthe cheering of the most en-
' thusiastic spectators to greet our
eyes since the days of State Vs RPI.

Another bombshell exploded when
plans were introduced for bringing
a real live basketball team to State
and to recapture the days of Han-
sen, Marsland and Ruback. We
think that this is a step in the right
direction to boost State College. If
the campaign accomplishes nothing
else it will add a long list of addres-
ses to Lashinsk’s little red book.
Sports Editor Makes Good

Basketball, Student Union and
Big Eights were rudely shoved'into
the background when .we received
some startling news from the gay
metropolis of Heuvelton. The Heu-
velton High boys clinched a “hot-
ly contested basketball champion-
ship. Yes—they were coached by
none other than our boy Bertram!
“ “ ’Twas on a Tuesday bleak and

dreary .

As we pondered weak and weary—3’
There we sat immersed in copy pa-
per and an over abundance of WAA
news when our unbelieving eyes
beheld an unending line of appli-
cants replying to Hylind’s plea for
sports writers. They were begging
on their knees and screaming out
qualifications. It was friend against
friend—survival of the fittest! We
sat in dazed silence and made firm
resolutions to get a minimum of
four hours sleep henceforth—but no.
it wasn't a dream. After days and
nights of torturous indecision Hylind
finally made a choice. The honored
few who were to be permitted to
join the sacred intelligentia which
weekly gathers about the sports desk
are Shoup and Stiles, '46; Day and
Sheehan, ’47 and Shapiro ’48.

In our Sophomore year our spirits
were battered by the combined in-
vectives of Byrne and Kiley. We sur-
vived—not stronger but wiser! This
year our most strenuous exercise
consisted in picking Hylind’s bruised
and battered body up from the PO.
floor each Friday shortly after the
News appeared in the Rotunda. Will
we ever forget the day that it took
twenty minutes to revive her as she
muttered madly in her delerium
casting horrible aspersions at MAA,
WAA and us?

A Fond Farewell

It is with another sigh and more
tears that we painfully remove our
athlete's feet from the hallowed
desk. 80 now we will fold up our
typewriter and silently stagger
away. Long live Mary Lizl!

~ . Last Wednesday night the Juniors
literally slid their way to a 4-2 vic-
tory over the Frosh. The muddy
dorm field provided spills and thrills
for the players and spectators re-
spectively. ‘
Score Tied

Valentine and Diehl scored for
the Frosh in the first and fifth inn-
ings while Buetow and He'rlihy did
the honors for the Juniors in the
first and fourth respectively. This
tied the score until the last inning
when Seymour made a grand slide
into first. The umpire called it out,
but the opinion of the spectators
made her reserve her decision in
favor of the Juniors. This was all
the Juniors needed. Bullock got a
hit into right ﬁeld, then Shoup got
on ﬁrst. This loaded the bases and
Dunn came up to bat. She hit Sey-
mour and Bullock home, but Shoup
was out on second. This brought in
two more runs for the Juniors bring-
ing their score up to four to heat the
Frosh.

Pitching Good

This game was the best played to
date in both organization and skill.
It was close all the way. Both pitch-
ers were on the ball. Daley pitched
for the Frosh and Seymour for the
Juniors.

The Milne Frosh game was nearly
rained out—a. continuation of the
softball weather jinx. .The teams
were evenly matched, but our Frosh
came through with a 13-12 win.
Tilden stared for the Frosh doing
a bang-up job for the fresh at bat
and in the field. Instead of her us-
ual position on second, she played
right field, a very lucky change for
the fresh. The whole mechanics of
the teams improved. Lest we forget
—Peg Daley also caused consider-
able comment when she decided to
take a mud bath on second base
and right in the middle of the game,
too. The rain didn’t help matters
too much, and oh, those white shorts.
Steady Performance

Both pitchers turned in a steady
performance, but both seemed a lit-
tle unsure of their ability. Daley
tossed for the Frosh, and Arnold for
the Milneites. Some of the Milne‘
girls show a lot of athletic prowness.
We couldn't help but notice the
‘close to spectacular playing of Kil-
by, Wilson, and Richardson.

We’d also like to comment on the
sportsmanship of both teams. It
takes a lot of spirit to laugh off
the rain these days.

The Senior-Soph game scheduled
for last Wednesday ‘was called off
because of guess what! The first two
guesses don’t count. The game has-
n’t been scheduled definitely for an-
other time, we’re all waiting for a
little sunshine on the subject.

Inspite of the warning the Frosh-
Milne game should have been,
Stokes and Farrell decided to tangle
on the Page field in an after supper
game.

Farrell Trailing

In the first four innings. Farrell
trailed 17-11. It looked as though
the ball game was going to Stokes
hands down. Pooler turned in a good
performance as did Boyenton. It's
really a treat to watch Boyenton
play ﬁrst —- she is spectacular in
catching wild throws from all parts
of the field.

In the fifth inning Farrell caught
a spark from someplace and surged
ahead with nine additional runs.
This was the last of the ﬁfth. There-
fore Farrell captured the game 20-
17. Haines and Weiss were good all
through and DiGregorio hurled for
the winners.

Seymour Elected;
Aides Chosen

Women’s Sports will be directed
next year. under the leadership of
Mary Seymour, who has been elect—
ed president of WAA for the year
45-46. She will be assisted by the
other officers who are as follows:
Gette Dunn, vice-president; Edna
Sweeney, treasurer; Wilma Diehl,
secretary and Betty Margot, who
will act as office manager.

Elections

The class of ’46 elected Nat Bul-
lock for WAA Manager. The office
of WAA representative for this class
is as yet unfilled since the four per-
sons originally qualiﬁed to fill this
office have either been elected to a
WAA office or to another office.
More Elections

As their officers ’47 elected Baker
as WAA Manager and Mastrangelo
as Representative. while ’48 chose
Tilden as Manager and Fiedler as
Representative.

Good Work

Since everyone on this new group
has been so active in sports this
year, and has shown their ability to
work together on other occasions.
certainly it will be safe to say that
an interesting and varied sports
program will be planned for next
year. There will be this years excel-
lent record to live up to and per—
haps a new record to establish.

Frosh men’s tennis and the inter-
collegiate basketball opened the
sports season.

Men in Rivalry

Rivalry came to the fore when the
fresh broke the record ‘of many
years, as Marty Bortnick and his
men of muscle led the frosh to vic-
tory over the Sophs‘ in the pushball
game. However, the Blue Devils
bowed to the Crimson Tide in the
touch football and in women’s hoc-
key.

Our gal Shoupie held her own as
runner up in the WAA tennis tour-
nament semi-finals. Jean Turner
and Gette Dunn were elected as
WAA Representative and Manager
respectively.

Rivalry Basketball

Frosh men won the hockey game
and “Fantasies,” Ryan and Bort-
nick couldn’t hold back the Crim-
son Tide in basketball. Heriihy
scored 18 points to spark the Blue
Devil team but the fresh girls lost
their rivalry basketball game.

’4ll’er Lore Kuhn won the “champ
or chump" ping pong tournament.
Gette Dunn was placed on the
All-State basketball team. We lost
the girls’ softball game despite the
skillful starring of Seymour.

The Devils Return

For a bigger and better year in
rivalry sports, Gette Dunn was elect-
ed WAA Manager and Shoupie WAA
Representative.

We admit the rivalry sports scores
were pretty bad in our freshman
year but we were really loaded with
pep and spirit when we came back
as Sophomores and won rivalry! No,
they couldn’t keep a good class
clown!

Forty-six Triumps

The Blue Devil made a sweeping
victory over the Green Gremlins in
the WAA rivalry obstacle races and
smothered the fresh team in the
hockey game led on by Tini, Slackie
and Van Auken. Yes, the frosh girls
did win two out of the three basket-
ball games, however, the Sophs cap-
tures the swimming meet and de-
feated them in softball.

Nor can we forget Ferber’s win-
ning over Garfall in the two tennis
tournaments. All in all, it was a suc-
cessfui year.

1 Career * ‘RainPostpones  . a

Pharmacy Game

‘ By GEORGE'HESS ,_

Jupiter Pluvius knit his brow
Wednesday afternoon and shed tears.
copius enough to rain-out the sche-
duled softball game between State
and Albany Pharmacy College. The
game had been planned for quite
some time, but the double-crossing
Albany Weather had held it up so
manytimes that the fellows decided
to play it anyway.

Two O’clock [litters

At game time the skies were a
bit threatening. Batting and fielding
practice went all right. Everybody
was pounding the ball at a terrific.
clip. Long drives were far outdistanc-
ing the best efforts of the frantic out-
ﬁelders. The infielders were being
bowled-over by screaming liners
that defied all attempts to catch
them.

After about a half hour of this
pleasant pastime the thunderheads.
were piling up so fast that the boys
decided to play a game. Woodworth
stood on the mound, the batter was.
at the plate, Kaufman was ready to
call balls and strikes when the first
warning drops began to fall. Waving
the rain aside, Woodworth started
to throw them in. The ball was a bit
slippery and the first man walked.

A wild pitch and a passed ball put

the runner on third. He scored
when Brophy failed to hold onto a
fly into short right field. A wild
throw by the State third baseman
scored the second Pharmacy run.
Woodworth brought things to a.
stop by striking out the next man.

By this time the rain was pulling
no punches. Everybody made a dash
for Pierce Hall where a hasty con-
sultation postponed the game until
another day.

Sparta ’Rouud—ﬂdaut

Someone should write an “Ode to
the Rain" or something, and maybe
if they made it good and sarcastic
the rain would take a hint and go
away. Then we could play our regular
spring games like softball for ex-
ample, without the fear of getting
our nice clean, white shorts all
dirty~isn’t that right Peg?

There are really only about two
weeks more of school before exams
start, and that means only two
weeks more to get in credit for
these sports—of course there is al-
ways the possibility of playing vol-
leyball or archery in between exams
when there is nothing else to do.

Archery practice is Tuesday and
Thursday from 4—5 on the Dorm
field. Palmatier is captain of this
sport.

Badminton is also played on the
Dorm field at 3:30 every Tuesday
and Thursday. This sport is com-
bined with volleyball and Diehl and
Van Vranken are co-captains.

Used Book Drive

A used book drive will be spon-
sored by War Activities Council,
Monday and Tuesday of next week
to secure books for American pris—
oners of war. Marie Leibl, ’46,
president of War Activities Coun-
cil, has announced that a box will
be placed in the lower hall of Dra-
per for the collection of the books.

If enough books are collected, it
will be possible to send them to
students in the Philippines, China
and other liberated areas. All kinds
of books are needed, especially text
books. No text books concerning
advanced physics. chemistry, geo-
graphy and radio published after
1938 can be accepted. Books criti-
cizing the German military regime
or NllZi activities have also been
banned.

The drive, which netted forty
thousand books last year, is being
conducted in American colleges
throughout the nation. According
to Miss Liebi, “Anyone who wishes
to keep his books until after exams
may donate them then. Let's climax
a successful year in war work with
this drive."

Juniors Crown Stiles May Queen

The climatic closing of the Junior
Big Eight, "Through the Years,"
last Saturday was the crowning of
Genevieve Stiles as May Queen. The
tense anticipation of the audience
ended as Miss Stiles entered, at-
tended by Agnes Young and Shirley
Ford. Eunice Wood, last year‘s May
Queen, attended by Elizabeth I.
McGrath and Lynn Wolff. placed
the crown on the new queen of the
Junior class.

“Through the Years” was a retro-
spective view of America's musical
career, written and directed by
Mike Beutow. Chorus and choreo-
graphy were under the supervision
of Toni O'Brien. As the acts un-
folded the progression of American
music was revealed in colorful re-
vue.

This program culminated the
year‘s Big Eight schedule of W.A.C.
benefit presentations. Student As-
sociation has voted to assign the
Big Eight proceeds as follows: $1,000
for the purchase of books and fur-
nishings for Rhouds General Hos-
pital and $745.07 to the Student
Union Fund. A check for $1.000
will be presented to a patient repre-
seiiting Rhoads Hospital at a Me-
iiiorial Day ceremony in Page Hall
at 1 o’clock on Wednesday.

The following is the financial re.-
port of the Big Eight series for the
year:

Veteran's Troupe
Will Entertain

Scrotogc To 3: Scene

Oi State Production

The State College Veteran's
Troupe will perform for the first
time tonight at the Saratoga Vet-
eran's Hospital. This group, which
was formed early in the year by
Shirley Seigal Passow, 46, has un-
dergone a series of rehearsals and
is now ready to display its talent.
At noontime in the Commons, the
student body will have an oppor-
tunity to see portions of the Green-
wich Village Show for a slight ad-
mission. The money collected will
be used to cover the group’s travel-
ling expenses.

The“ show, directed by Dorothea
Silvernail, ’47, and Elaine Navy, {48,
is a combination of the outstanding
acts of the major college produc-
tions of the year. The directors
have succeeded in creating a. unity
of impression .-and spontaneity of
action with a Greenwich village
street scene as a setting.

Evening’s Program

A street-side artist, a poet and
writer, portrayed by Anne Ricer,
Barbara Otto and Ellen Fay, fresh-
men, will add that spark of realism
to the various sight—seeing singers,
dancers, and comedians. Muriel Ru-
bin, ‘47, singing “My Man,” and
Mary Jane Giovannone, ’48 vocaliz-
ing “Stormy Weather," head the list
of performers. A bit of "Rum and
Coca Cola" will be offered to the
servicemen on behalf of the ever-
popular Sayles Hall Trio composed
of Sylvia Trop, ’46, Helen Kiesel
and Helen Lengyel, freshmen. Dor~
eon Holand, ’48, singing “One For
The Road.” and the Statesman duet
of Jim Minor. '46, and Bill Mallory,
'47, rendering “Anatole of Paris,”
complete the singing numbers of
the evening.

Variety Dancing Included

Tap dancing, can-canning, jitter-
buggiiig and interpretive dancing
will undoubtedly help to brighten
up the spirits of the wounded sol—
diers. Vivian Nielsen, Betty Bren-
nan and Marilyn Warshaw, Sopho-
mores, will be featured in a. tap
dance to the tune of the "Darktown
Strutter's Ball." The alluring quar-
tet of Judy Dube. Janet Iiigiehart,
Trudy Smith, and Julia Collier,
Sophomores, will go into their Ta-
Ra-Ra-Boon-ti-a routine.

Marianne Davis, ’46. will deviate
from the jive-theme with her Gypsy
and Latin-American dances. A
display of jittei'bug talent, including

Joyce To Direct Dram”.
Shieii Will Play Lead ‘
In Psychological Study '

College Playhouse presents its

second production of the season. ‘ '

Night Must Fall by Emlyn. Wil- r
liams tomorrow night at 8:30 p. m.
in Page Hall auditorium. Martha
Joyce, ’45, president of the Play-
house, will direct the play.

Night Must Fall is a drama tak-
ing place in England, complete with
British accent and Scotland Yard,
portraying a psychological analysis
of Dan, woman charmer and killer,
played by Wilbur Shieff, ’47. Lu-
cille Kenny, ’45, plays Mrs. Bram-
som, a querilous, selfish invalid
who is completely captivated by
Dan and his debonaire ways. Mar-
gery Cronin, '45, in the role of
Olivia, shields Dan since she, too,
is strongly attached to him. From
bell-boy in the hotel, he becomes
star boarder in the Bramson house-
hold, even though he had origin-
ally been called there to answer
for having seduced Dora, Eliza-
beth I. McGrath, '46, a dull but
pretty maid. Suspicion centers on
Dan when a murder is committed
in the vicinity and Inspector Bel-
size from Scotland Yard, Robert
Loucks, ’45, is assigned to the case.
All-Emotion Mystery

The plot unfolds as Dan,
grateful to Olivia for concealing
evidence against him, but power~
less in the grip of his homicidal in-
stincts, plans the murder of Mrs.
Bramson for her money. Mrs. Ter-
rence, portrayed by Elaine Drooz,
'45, adds a humorous touch to the
seriousness of the plot by her in-
dependent and haughty ways with
her employer, Mrs. Bramsom. Sus-
picion is concentrated not only on
Dan, but also on Hubert Laurie,
played by Robert Hardt, ’48. Laurie
is a calm, digniﬁed character who
loves Olivia, who in turn is com-
pletely bored by him. Mystery and
suspense, with romance and hu-
mor, combine to present a baffling,
but inevitable conclusion.

Scene Set in Modern England

A Victorian set is used through-
out the entire play, placing the set-
ting in the Bramsom household.
The action takes place in modern
England—«which lends suitable at-
mosphere for the drama.

The complete cast is as follows:
Lucille Kenny, '45, as Mrs. Bram-
som; Elizabeth L. McGrath, ‘48, as
the maid; Wilbur Shieff, '47, as
Dan; Robert Hardt, ’48, as Hubert
