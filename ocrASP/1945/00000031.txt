Looking, Ahead . . .

About this time every year, someone attempts to
sum up the work of the preceding semesters. Us-
ually, we overlook the drawbacks and dwell solely
on the accomplishments. This year the surge for-
ward left the delaying influences far behind. But
the delaying influences did exist. In the ﬁrst week
of the college year, there was a definite complacency
and lack of cooperation evident in the Student
Association. There were several conflicts among
the students; between students and the administra-
tion; between organizations.

With new projects brought before the Student
Body, there came an increasing interest and our
assemblies were often favored by heated but healthy
controversy. Student Council enacted its powers
and duties to the limit of its ability. These factors
brought about new ideas for a more efficient and
more active Student Association. .

Revision of the Student Association Constitution
was not an idea, but a job to be done immediately
and a committee was formed for that purpose. The
size of the task of such a revision became evident,
and the committee realized the need of new ideas.
So it was that Student Council arranged three Ar-
bitration Conferences which, aside from furnishing
a firm basis for a revised constitution, carried State
into the light of recognition by other colleges.

Inter-group Council won the financial support
of the students, an indication in itself that State was
behind them in their work. It was the formation
of this group, instigated by students, that caused
State to be unanimously chosen one of nine col-
leges out of eighty by the American Council on Edu-
cation, whose purpose is to conduct an experiment
on inter-group education. Undeniably, this national
recognition will boost State even further.

War Activities and Student Union were support-
ed, not by all, but by a good share of the stu-
dents. The results are obvious, as are the effects
of the Student—Faculty teas, sponsored with the
set purpose of bettering student-faculty relations.

If such noticeable advances occurred in light
of delaying influences, we cannot help but wonder
how much further we can go with complete cooper-
ation with the leaders of our own choosing next
year. Magnificent steps have been taken this year
and the standards we have set are high. it is up
to us to dwell wholeheartedly on living up to
and surpassing them in the semesters to come.

Contrast In Blue . . .

The 1944-’45 Big 8 season closed not with a.
bung~~~but a whimper.

After months of looking forward to what was pro-
claimed as “the biggest show that ever hit State,”
little but disillusion and disappointment were in
store for the audience of “Through the Years.” it
was particularly disheartening because the revue
contained some really professional acts and a num-
ber of musical arrangements that were expertly

  

 

 

In the revue in its entirety, however, the lack of
a theme was a formidable mistake.
little like a series of dress rehearsals without con~
necting links between acts and even scenes.

There were other errors also-errors obvious
enough to be seen by the most unprofessional of ,
the spectators. llut . . . the milk is already spilt. simian. .\

in our opinion, “'I'ill We Meet Again” remains,
now more than ever, the best musicalalrama prc-
sentcd in State's current history.

III New Schedule

Shirley Rice, '46, second term pres-
ident of Commuter's Club, has an-
nounced the club’s plans for a larger
membership and increased activi-
ties during the coming year. The
group has a potential membership
of more than three hundred stu-
dents and intends to increase the
acting members to at least one hun-
dred. .

A large scale membership drive
among the new freshmen has been
planned. Speakers for Commuter's
Club at Fresh Camp will emphasize
the fact that all students who do
not live in group houses are classed
as commuters. Stress will also be
laid on the benefits of the club to
each individual member. During the
first weeks of school a. contest to
determine the best caricature of
Transfer Tommy will be held among
’49ers. The Fresh Tea is to be the
primary social function. Two other
social events are scheduled for the
first semester. One of these will
probably be a Commuter's Big Eight,
which is expected to reveal the mul-
tiple talents of their group.

Plans for an active membership
have been formulated and the com-
muters hope to complete successfully
all the projects leading to their goal
for next year.

The United States stands in ser-
ious danger of losing her inimitable
position as mediator between Great
Britain and the Soviet Union. This
has become apparent since the San
Francisco conference when, for the
first time, we took definite sides
on a. number of political issues. The
Polish issue is the outstanding ex-
ample which comes to mind. With
the disclosure that Russia has in-
terned 1'} Polish officials who had
been flown to the Soviet Union,
allegedly for negotiations about a
government, the American State
Department announced that it
would back up England in her dc-
mnnd that the Warsaw provisional
government be scrapped. Shortly
after the Kremlin refused to dis—
cuss the matter any further.

Even more startling was the rev-
elation last week by the Herald-
Tribune that President Roosevelt
had written Prime Minister Chur-
chill that this government disap-
proved of the British stand on P0-
land. That we intended to follow
the Yaltn agreement to set up a
provisional government which
should have as its basis the the
old Lublin lenders. 'l‘hcsc letters
were never publisher]. however, and
the shift in our foreign policy oc-
curred bcforo they were made
known to the nation.

Such about-face by our govern-
ment lends to the coiwlusion that
the. State Department, wns. indeed,
the spokesman for President Roo-
sevelt's policies. The happy results
of this arrangement. seem bound for
iiiisi’ortinic, with the removal of
our grout. statesman.

An even more important. factor
is the coming general election in
England, her first in 10 years, Mr.
Winston Churchill. who has made
his reputation as n grunt \vur lead-
or. comes up against, popular vote
for the first time since he took over
the war coalition cabinet. The cub-
lnot has refused to maintain its
coulition iiiitll the. end of the war
with Japan. and August seems to
be the probable date of elections.

Mr. Churchill wants to be re-
clcctcd. His wnr record may scarce-
ly bo \vcighty enough for this. l-lo
must present it platform which Will

tinued war effort and reconstruc-

cabinet was Mr, Churchill's reason

chances reflect on the world situa-
tion?

To begin with. he has endorced
a progressive program of social se-
curity. Albeit the war has smashed
Britain into disaster, the proposed
program of modern housing, educa-
tion. child care, etc., to be subsi-
dized through government funds is
far superior to anything pending in
the United States. (While we have
not been disrupted by war as tra-
gically as England. we still have a
shameful record in these field in
too many sections of the country.)
A wave of enthusiasm is sure to
glorify the leader of such a far-
sccing program.

Nor is it hard to understand why
this week. there were rumors that
England was sending troops into
Yugoslavia “to quell disorder.“ as
they did in Greece. Still more om—
inous. the British are reported to
be sending General Anders’ anti-
Sovlct Polish troops to patrol the
border of Germany next to the So-
viet-controlled portion.

British self-interest is some-
thing to which one can be sympa-
thetic, up to a point. When that
scltklntcrcst nullil'ics the hard work
of United Nations' diplomats in San
Francisco: when that self-interest
is allowed to turn guns toward a
nation which is still an nllymin
direct contradiction to the ideals
of this \iur and the horrible suffer-
ing of this war, that. self-interest
becomes a real menace to the peace

News Bulletin, Movies

Newly installed officers of the
there college religious clubs have
announced plans for the forthcom-
ing year.

Joseph Palevsky '46, president of
Hillel, has announced that plans
are being discussed to present a
movie, a three act play, and a dance
in conjunction with the other two
religious clubs. Hillel will also spon-
sor a movie on Jewish culture for
the interests of their own group.
Tentative plans are underway for
a radio broadcast over the Albany
network. Exhibits explaining Jew-
ish customs and culture will be on
display in the college at intervals.
throughout the year. According to

«If, 1'

the president, next year's Hillel.

meetings will be devoted more to
the Jewish problem at State College
than to the national theme as in
former years. The organization also
plans to publish a monthly news
bulletin to report events at the bi—
monthly meetings.

Newman Plans Masses

Newman Club members will attend
Mass and receive Holy Communion
at 8 o’clock Sunday morning in the
small grotto in the church of Our
Lady of Lourdes. Father William
F. Cahill, chaplain of Newman Club.
will officiate at the Mass. In past
years a breakfast has followed these
services and although this year the
shortage of food makes the break-
fast impossible, Newman Club mem-
bers voted at the last meeting to
have the Mass as usual.

Betty Jane McGrath ’46, newly
installed president of Newman Club,
also announced that the plans for a
Mass for the graduating Seniors
previously scheduled for June 18 at
7:30 o'clock in the small grotto have
been changed. Definite arrange-
ments have not yet been made.
Plans will be announced as soon as
they are formulated.

SCA to Hold Picnic

Plans are underway for an S.C.A.
picnic at the Six Mile Water Works,
Tuesday. May 29. Harriet. Brinkman,
president of the group has an-
nounced. The purpose of the picnic
is to discuss plans for the coming
year, but final plans will not be de-
cided until fall.

Sung to themad'muaic of arvfu»
neral march, this‘cheerful little
ditty has become the by word of the
oppressed slaves and slavesses who
stalk the halls where angels fear to
tread. Such trite and naively sin-
cere expressions as “crud” and “T.
S." have become obsolete, merely
mementoes of a by-gone era when
hearts were happy and-fancies were
free. That carefree time . . . pre-
exam paradise.

brightly bound stacks beckon the
poor, the cripple, the maimed and
the wretched into this soothing in-.
terior of the college’s domain of

Curfew lifting has brought back
the revival of. an ancient and time-
honored custom . . . burning the
midnight oil. This timely tradition
must be attended with great and ap-
preciative ceremony. Wide awake
interest, absence of fleshly fantasies
and an eagerly avid desire to learn
are prime prerequisites in the pur-
suit of this custom. All else is for-
