Nice Going ' v
"H'yiites was a column for WAA
..andngrA. We feel sure that there
r‘must‘have’ been many times when
the ed. would have preferred to

write on some other topic of genn

‘eral interest, but. instead devoted
the column to sports. This very
nicely did away with the former
criticism that the sports editor’s
column dealt with everything but
AA news. This year more construc-
_ tive criticism was offered instead of
the usual "line" that everybody
used to gripe about.

This year it should be noted also
that the rating given sports page
by the Associated Collegiate Press
was the highest it has been in some
years. We were rated very good on
coverage and treatment, very good
on display, and excellent on sports
writing. A total of 100 out of a
possible 120 points was scored. The
credit should go to Hylind. She re-
ally worked on fourth'page to make
it what you would like to have it.
It has been a pleasure working un-
der her this year.

Rain Again

At this writing we are seriously
considering writing in large, black,
letters RAIN . N J SPORTS
PAGE. It’s simply gone beyond the
stage of \being s laughing matter.
In one way it’s a good thing that
this issue is the last one or this is
exactly what would happen. We
have high hopes of seeing all the
games and reporting on them and
what happens—well you know as
well as we do. This A.M., because
there was a softball game schedul-
ed for tonight, we laughineg pre-
dicted rain. Little did we know at
the time that truer words were
never spoken. Believe us — this
ends our predicting!

Good Year

All in all, we should say that it
has been an interesting sports year.
The beginning of the year saw the
State Owls open the football sea-
son opposing and defeating Siena
in the first game of the season.
Games with Med. followed and for
an inexperienced, touch-tackle
team State did all right. At the
end of the season, the fellows could
boast a .500 average, which is not
bad, considering that it was the
first time they had ever worked to-
gether as a team and that they did
not get too much cooperation from
the students. The ping-pong, pool
and bowling tourneys followed with
MAA taking the hardest 'blow as
Uncle Sam kept calling and calling
for more MEN! Of course he wasn’t
the only one calling, but look who
Won out!

WAA began it’s year as usual
with the basketball league contests.
Approximately 16 teams signed up
in order to compete in the league.
Gamma Kap topped the league in
its final encounter with BZ. This
league succeeded in showing State
some exciting basketball. Bowling
and ping-pong tournaments follow-
ed with Ray Weiss capturing ping-
pong honors and Phi Delt winning
the bowling league.

It's been work this year. but its
been fun. too. We've enjoyed work-
ing on fourth page and we're really
looking forward to next year. So—
until then, so long, easy exams and
have a nice vacation.

, Fresh To. Milne,
Game Will ad Series
The Jolly juniors did it again.
They beat the Seniors,_8-4, in the

first game the Seniors have played
so far this year. ‘

In the beginning it looked as the
though the Juniors had the game
hands down. However, Bostwick
had other ideas, and was the first '
Senior to get on base—this was in
the third inning. This was all the
Semors needed, and from then on
it was anybody’s ball game.

Mud Disasters .

The Purple Heart goes to Garfall
who sacrifices a perfectly clean pair
of jeans when she sat directly in
the dedle of the largest mud pud-
dle in the field. Oh. yes, she was
after an infield fly. Anita Fien-
stein stole the show. While running
from second to third, she lost a shoe
——she had to run—what was she to
do? She did the only thing an ath-
lete could do—she' left the shoe and
risked the cold, muddy foot which
she got. Wading through the puddle
on third, she finally got home where
she was welcomed enthusiastically

  

Do You‘hke Gym Classes!
Softball Prowdes Answer

Interested spectators line the
peristyle to Gideon Hawiey Hall
(the Library to you) to watch the
girls bat them around in the
physical education classes’ soft-
ball games.

The seriousness with which
these athletes take. their intra-
ciass contests was evident in the
unusual game staged Tuesday by
the 10 AM. gym enthusiasts.

One Sophomore woman hit a
long one that sailed over Robin
street, bounced off the roof of a
parked car and continued on its
merry way. A conscientious
outfielder returned it in a wild
throw that caught the Sopho-
more miss ln the back of the
neck Just as she completed the
diamond.

If the class hadn't already fill-
ed out questionnaires for the hy-
giene department, one answer to
that query “Do you like gym? If
not why not?", might have been.
—“Softbail gives me a pain in
the neck!”

 

 

 

 

 

by her classmates.

The Juniors? Sure, they played
too, Beutow, Shoup, Bullock, Sey-
mour, they were all good, but the
Seniors got a kick out of playing,
that only Seniors could get.

State vs. Milne

Competdsion has run high this
year between Milne and the State
College freshmen, since each team
won one basketball game and the
frosh won the softball game played
last week. The Milnites will have
a chance to even up the score when
the final softball game of the series
will be played next Tuesday on
Page Field at four o’clock.

Arnold will pitch for Milne with
Kilby catching while Daly will toss
the ball for ’48. Valentine will re-
ceive for the frosh. The bases will
be guarded for Milne by Heiden-
r-elch, first, Wilson, second, and
Brehm, third.‘ Martin, short-stop,
and Paxton or Pelletier in short
field will complete the infield back-
ing Arny up. Murray, Richardson
and Fletcher will catch the out-
field flies.

Frosh Team

Boynton will hold down the in-
itial sack for the fresh with Tllden
at second and Young playing third.
Diehl will cover the territory be-
tween i‘lrst and second, while Shap-
iro. playing short-stop will snag the

remainder of the grounders to the
infield. Maginess in left, A. Fisher
in center, and Osborne in right will
complete the freshman team.

Richardson, who is a Senior, is
Milnes heaviest hitter and is ex-
pected to give Daly some trouble.
However, Arnold. Kilby and Martin
have been known to come through
in the pinches when a hit was des-
perately needed. It was only the
ram that helped State to hold them
back at their previous encounter.
Tilden, Boynton, Valentine and
Maginess will attempt to hit Arn-
old out of the box, as this will prob-
ably be th-eir last game of the year.
The fresh have been noted for tight
fielding and if luck is with them
they might overpower the Milne
team, which is not too steady on
fielding.

Juniors Win

Only the Juniors have completed
their WAA softball schedule for
the year. because the rainy weather
has postponed all the other games.
As yet, the Sophomores have to
play the Seniors and the fresh. The
Seniors also have to play the fresh—
men and this game will probably
decide the team that will fill sec-
ond place. as the Juniors have been
declared the winners after three
straght wins.

  

Stresses Minor. .' Seem,

'49 Reception. improved.

We though it might! be a‘ good
idea to take a look this week, into
the future plans of WAA, which
Mary Seymour has formulated for
next year. In our interview with
her, we got a pretty good idea of
what kind of a program will be of-
fered, and so we pass it on to you.

“My one 'hope," says next years. '

WAA president, “is to carry out the
WAA program next year under the
able leadership of this year’s coun-
cil and with the aid of a well picked.
council for ’45-’46."

“Already we have formed some
new ideas to encourage WAA mem-
bers to come all-out for a successful
year.”

Frosh Welcome

“We intend to start off with our
usual frosh welcome in the fall—

but with an extra touch. All of you’

who have credit in four sports and
are wondering" what has become of
your award, will be happy to know
that these awards have not gone un—
heeded. They will be awarded at the
welcome. This will show the frosh
what they have to work for and at
the same time help to introduce
WAA to them.”

“We have plans for a splash party
at the. Public Bath for anyone who
can splash. It's something new and
we’ll complete the plans later.”
Camp Johnston Again

“All you campers who were disap-
pointed at not having enough week-
ends at Camp Johnston, can get
away from it all more often next
year, because we plan to have more
week ends at that haven."

“If the weather permits, we’re also
planning a couple of sleigh rides.”

"This year we started work on a
sports night, so if over the summer
you’ll practice your tumbling, we’ll
be able to stage a real gym exhibi-
tion.”

Sports Captains

“The sports captains for next fall
have been elected and two repre-
sentatives have been chosen to go
to hockey camp. They are Diehl '48
and Margot ’47. One representative
has been chosen to attend swimming
camp this summer.”

“We are also planning to have
hockey games with other colleges."

“These ideas combined with this
years program, should provide a full
schedule and we hope to culminate
it with a banquet or festival in the
spring."

Sounds like a full year doesn’t
it? Good luck Seymour and Coun-
cil. here’s hoping that you are able
to carry out those plans.
