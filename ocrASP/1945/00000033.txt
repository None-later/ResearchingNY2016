Welcome I949

Hello Fresh! You have come to State in a transitory period.
Just as the Class of 1946 began amid the hubub of recon-
version to a war—time world, you have ceine to take part in
getting State back into a peacetime college. Conditions will
be uncertain this year just as they were that fall three years
ago. You must feel that you are part of State and welcomed
by us. You must devote your energy toward making our re-
conversion a swift and efficient task, rather than a jumbled
mess.

as;

The Class of 1949 is an intelligent and spirited group, j
judging from the conduct at Freshman Camp. There is an ‘
abundance of talent of an unusual variety, a sample of which ;

We tasted at the fresh talent show. These qualities are not _
something to be regarded lightly and then allowed to rust. ,
State College needs you, 1949. We feel grateful that you are §

the class to help us get back to normal.
Perhaps you are wondering how you can influence State
so much. You feel like a green bunch that doesn’t yet know

Sayles To Stress Aims
For Balanced Curriculum

The first Assembly of the year
will open this morning with the tra-
ditional singing of the Alma Mater
and an official welcome to the stu-
dent body from Helen Slack Shure,
'46, President of Student Associa-
tion. Myskania and Student Coun-
cil members will then be introduced

 and Dr. John M. Sayles. President

" of the College, will speak.

exactly what it’s all about. But you are the first peacetime f;
class. You must keep both eyes and ears alert. You will be : -
subject to all kinds of propaganda. You must learn to sift .

all that you see and hear. You will be the deciding vote on
many of the major issues. It is vital that you really think
about them as they come along. Learn to listen to the facts
presented by a speaker rather than the pathos with which
they are presented.

For four years, State students have been suffering from a
touch of war hysteria. It has not gotten too much out of
control, but it has been the cause of a lot of unnecessary bick-
ering and loss of view of the goals before us. You have not
experienced this disease so you have a head start on us.

Three years from now, the class of 1949 will be the leaders
of the college. It is important that you prepare yourselves
for that task, beginning now. You are welcomed by State
college because you are part of State college. Show us 1949;
we’re depending on you.

Weicomcs, addresses, rehear- butic modern dancing to a German

fife echoed through the walls of
Ingle. Fresh singers, pianists, and
monologues prove that '48 will have

Even the counselors added their lit-
tle tidbit with Casey and Subatini
shaking up the "Dark ’l‘own Strut-

Sleep did eventually descend upon
all campers though it be upon one's
elbow and though it (lid take con-
siderable time to persuade the fresh
that bull sessions are frequently
indulged and that "the Hortoise and
the Tare" could easily revive in the
morning.

Sunday brought farewells, and
with these farewells came the re-
gret that Fresh camp could be but
three days out of the short 365.

cess, thanks to Jean Griffin who
despite a swollen foot managed to

Following Mrs. Shure’s Welcome
to the new freshmen class, each
member of Myskania, College hon-
orary society, will rise and be in-
troduced to the Assembly. Student
Council. composed of the elected
representatives of each class, will
also be introduced. Mrs. Shure will
then announce the Class guardians
who are: Harriet Brinkman and
Shirley Passow for the Class of ’46;
Elizabeth O'Neil and Mary Seymour
for the Class of 1947; Elizabeth Mc-
Grath and Robert Sullivan for the
Class of 1948; Betty Hamilton and
Marie Liebl for the Class of 1949.

Sayles’ Welcome

Dr. Sayles, main speaker, will
open his talk with a greeting to the
freshman class. He will continue
his speech, outlining the aims of the
college student as he begins his
new year. Stress will be laid on
the importance of striking a “happy
medium" between school work and
extra-curriculum and of thus eb—
taining the maximum benefit from
both through an intelligent balance.

Assembly will close with the sing-
ing of the star Spangled Banner and
a recessional of Myskania, with each
class following in order of seniority.

Students are requested to be in
their seats by 11:05, as the doors
