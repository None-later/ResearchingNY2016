Dear servicemen from State:

We all» miss'you—come on home. If the thought
of us old goils waitln’ here back home don't trill you
enough to make you wanna come back, tell ya what
I'm gonna do. You’ve heard of Bess Myerson, the Miss
America for 1945. Well, she was New York City's
entry (comes from the Bronx) and I got a relative
livm’ in New York City and sure enough if she don't
live in the exact same apartment house as Miss
America herself. If. you come back to State and
you’re over six feet tall (Bess is 5 ft. 10 in. in her
stocking feet) I'll'ask my relative who lives in the
selfsame apartment house as Miss America herself
to give me Miss America herself's phone number for
you. And not only is Miss America beautifulﬂshe's
also a college graduate and a TEACHER (well. she
gives music Iessons——that makes her a teacher, don’t
idt?) So seine on home, fellas. and I'll see what I can

0.

 

 

With love,
Mindy

.Well, all youse, how does it feel to be reading the
first issue of the STATE COLLEGE News printed after
the end of the war? Everything looks rosy now (rosier,
anyhow) and the happiest thought of all is that the
time has come once more for the State College corri—
dors to be enhanced of men. Yes girls, you can get
out your Iipsticks and dust off that formal . . . it’ll
take a little while. of course, but we will get our
men back. you know. Why already we're hearing
that Carr Pangburn expects to be reconverted from
a Merchant Marine to a State College in no time at
all. And what's more, he's bringing a friend with
him! Now there’s a man who’s got ideas. Supposing
every ex-Statesman came back and brought a friend
With him. Why, then we'd have just twice as many
males around as they did in the “good old days" and
then maybe some of the oldtimers who have seen the
days of yore will quit gloating about how different
it was when they went to State—and we could even
make them jealous! So write your boyfriend (or write
somebody else’s boyfriend . . . what’s the difference 7)
and tell him all about the “Carr Pangburn Plan”
And oh, by the way (said very casual like as if this
is Just incidental) . . . when you do hear from those
boyfriends, how about letting us in on it?

For those of you who didn't have the good fortune
(or the eighty dollars) to attend the accelerated (and
otherwise) summer session, let us have a brief ac-
count of the effect of the “eve of surrender" on us
here. Summer session students had been observing
ten o'clock hours on week nights. Then the surrender
news was flashed across the wires. “Tonight.” pro-
foundly stated a housemother. “you may stay out
until eleven!"

A group of State cclebrants were at the Playdium
the night of the surrender (bowling. of course). In
the midst of the gala celebration. they noticed three
big sailors in very high spirits (or perhaps I should
say three very high spirits in big sailors). Through
the entire evening, the three Men of the Fleet stood
in a huddle in the middle of tli floor, while from their
vocal chords floated the mellifluous strains of “When
the War Is Over. We Will All Enlist Again” Three
days later the same aforementioned State students
returned to the same afl'n'cmcntioncd place (to do 21
little of the some aforementioned bowling, you are
supposed to presume), ’l‘hcre stood the three sonic
aforementioned sailors singing the some aforemen-
tioned song. “Oh. I say there,” suggested one of the
State students, “why don't you fellows go home and
get some sleep now?" “Now,” answered one of the
sailors, “we're waitin’ here ’till we gct our (lisrhnrgc
papers." And they continued singing. the old opti—
mists las aforementioned . . . l '

President Trmnan's abrupt can—
celafion of lend-lease to England
evoked waves of comment through.-
out the country. Some thought it
signified shrewd business, others
rated it a direct blow to England’s
new Labor Government. This week.
a. former resident of England, Gcr-
hard Weinberg, ‘lﬂ, (viralyws the re-
ccnl election in terms of its signif-
icance to America.

During the summer, most of us
were surprised by the overwhelm-
ing victory of the Labor Party in
the British elections. Obtaining
nearly 400 seats in Commons to the
Conservatives' 200, the Labor Party
for the third time in its history was
called by the king to form a gov-
ernment. It was the first time that
it could do so alone; before. it had
had to form a coalition with the
Liberal Party the party which
gave Britain its New Deal in the
first if) years of this century.

In the recent elections, thc Lil)—
crol Party itself was almost cliniln-
oted from ’nrliuincnt; both of its
shining lights, Sir Archibald Sin—
clair and Sir William lcvcridgc,
\vcrc defcntcd at the polls. So wcrc

NEWS. THURSDAY SEPT. 21. 1945

 

British have ellcted reformers. not
revolutionaries.

Nationalization of the railways,
telegraph, mines, and perhaps a few
other industries may provide the
needed push to get Britain through
its troubles. In that case, the Unit—
ed Statcs will profit greatly since
England has been our best customer
in the post and may again be able
to furnish us with a favorable trade
balance. If this program fails, Brit-
ain will suffer further economic
hardships while we will lose a lot
of trade. Nationalization of the
Bank of England will probably not
affect this country very much. since
most of its assets were loaned to the
British government for the prosecu-
tion of the var.

It is almost certain that there will
be no important constitutional
changes in England. The House of
Commons is supreme. and the King
is very popular; that's that.

As far as the Empire is con-
ccrncd, there. too, few chnngcs :irc

Alibi Vs Action

Well, State, we’ve lost our favorite alibi. We
can’t blame our complacency in important matters
and our quibbling over trifles on the war anymore
because the war no longer exists.

We appeal to the freshmen to do their part to
help us get back to normal, but it is up to the up-
perclassmen to show them the way. How can we
show them the way? We can stand tip on our two
feet and think like the intelligent and adult individ-
uals that we are supposed to be. We can accept
the responsibilities as students of State College by
helping to maintain its standards. By that we do
not mean that one should become a “Stooge.” That
is the farthest thing from our minds. We feel, and
we think the administration would agree, that one
should not submerge hiinseli so far into the business
of getting an education that he forgets to learn
anythin r; nor, on the other hand, should he divert
his efforts so much toward being a social butterfly
that he forgets the whole essence of education and
its possibilities.

That is the first and most important phase of our
example to the freshmen. The second is an intelli—
gent participation in assemblies. Many students
have good ideas on various subjects that are men-
tioned, but hesitate to bring them up for fear of
starting something. Others have nothing to say but
waste a good deal of our time by quibbling over
unimportant and sometimes ridiculous points. This
should not be the case. An intelligent debate, no
matter how controversial, is 21 healthy Sign in any
college. It points toward an alertness among the
students. A heated argument over nothing is a tru-
gedy. Freshmen are usually confused in assembly
anyway and a general confusion among the upper-
classmcn does not help any.

ACT THREE: The theme is the old and worn
out expression, “class and school spirit". Rivalry
has definitely wavered a bit in the past two years.
We‘ve had an excuse for that too: limitation of
the dorm rivalry. Aren‘t we above the stage where
cold showers and wrestling are our only means of
fun? Outwitting the rival can be more fun than
just plain trickery by pranks. There is an abund-
ance of opportunity for mental exercise and applica—
tion of natural talents in the rivalry debate. the
sings. and the main presentations, all of which rc-
quirc creative ability.

Then. there are class elections which always
‘iiusc a lot of talk of dirty politics. 'I‘zilk, Iiowcvcr.

By ncxt yczir we will probably Iizlvc many of our
nicn back with us. Arc we going to gi‘cct thcin with

Active Program
For Coming Year

Plan Seminar Course,
Inter-Group Conference

Inter-Group Council, an organi-
zation formed last year to offer op-
portunlties for culture contact and
understanding among members of
every race and nationality in the
college and in the community, has
announced an active program for
1945-‘46. Plans include a conference
for the eleven State Colleges in No-
vember and a special seminar course
which will begin in October.

The council began last February
when a group of students interested
in inter-group cooperation met with
several faculty members to plan the
best method for carrying out their
ideas. Dr. LeRoy Bowman, Jr., di-
rector of adult education In New
York State. suggested that the
council meet with local culture
groups to exchange ideas and rec-
ommended channeling of demo-
cratic principles through the cur-
riculum of the college.

Inter-Group Seminar

In accordance with these sugges-
tions a seminar on Inter-Group Re-
lations for the Teacher will be
started in the middle of October. On
the committee in charge are Dr. T.
G. Standing, Professor of Econo—
mics and Sociology. and Gerhardt
Weinberg. ‘47. Outside speakers will
be obtained and a student commit—
tee to plan the program will be
named.

Student Conference

The First Student Conference on
Inter-Group Relations. one or the
main projects of the council this
year, will be held at Stats on Fri—
day and Saturday. November 2 and
3. Helen Slack Shiu‘e, ‘46. is chair-
man of the event and noted speak-
ers will be present to address the
delegates. All meetings will be
open and students may attend any
of the sessions. The aim of the
conference. according to Inter-
Gi‘oup Council. is to interest dele-
gates in developing councils in their
own collL‘gcs and to form :1 slate—
wicle council. Dr. Wntl Stewart,
Professor of History. is also w )I‘klllg
on the conl'ci‘cncc committee.

Two delegates will attend from
the 11 Stillc Triiclici's Collcgcs in
Albany. Potsduni. Plntlsburg, Onc-
onla, Gcncsco. Ncw Pnltz, Oswcgo.

Gadeye Glade-«7M

By CULLINAN and HILT

Have you ever thought about your
college? Do you know how it com-
pares wlth other colleges? What
improvements would you propose
for your college?

We would like to present these
questions to you. discuss them. an-
alyze them, and eventually perhaps
even solve them. We don’t pretend
to be experts, we don‘t have ultra-
radical leanings—we're just at-
tempting to provoke interest in
making State number one on the
college hit parade.

Take for instance our Junior
Guide program. This was set up to
give the freshmen friends who
would guide them through their
first weeks of confusion. shyness,
and uncertainty. and watch over
them during, their first two years
in college.

The present set-up has progressed
a great deal toward this goal. Even
within the past two years much has
licen (tour to strengthen this pro-
gram. Thc Siiidcnt Guide lcn held
131.5 post \vcck was llli example of
this growth. Wc fccl. howcwr. that
the maximum bcncl'lts possiblc un—

freshmen.

IIiil‘t' Mill“

As we see it, there are three

faults under this program:

i. The Guide has far too many

freshmen to adequately fulfill their
individual needs.

2. The methods of selecting such

Junior Guides excludes many po-
tential big sisters.

2. The idea of the sister class is
completely lost with the inclusion
of the Sophomore Guides. More-
over. the spirlt of rivalry under-
mines the influence that a big sis—
tcl‘ should maintain.

Every Guide this year was given
ill least two. if not three. little sis-
ters. The Guides' duties included
writing letters. meetings at the sta-
tion, and introductions at various
receptions.

It is impossible to give this nec-
Camry attention to each freshman.
\‘Jhy not incorporate the plan used
 Mdnhatinnville College in New
York City, whereby each member
(:1 the Junior class so desiring is
21' on a little SileI'. This interferes

linosin: our Junior Guides. Let
