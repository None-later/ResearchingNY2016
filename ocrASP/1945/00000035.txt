— By MARY LIZ SULLIVAN -—-—-

Cross the "Farewell" part of the
phrase “Hail and Farewell", add
Welcome and there you have it. ,We
of the sports page “Hail and Wei-
come” you with open arms. From
the expressions on faces and yells
of Hi! followed by blood curdling
screams, we guess that everybody is
rather glad to be back. And all those
new faces—they certainly look like
a super class—those froshi

But still, there are a few faces
that we do not see. These are the
ones we ask about and feel sorry
when we here that they are not
coming back. Sports Page has in
this way lost one of its Junior eds.
George Hess, who has worked on the
Sports page for two years and who
was to be one of this years Junior
editors, won’t be with us this year.
We’ll certainly miss him and hope
he’ll be with us again next year.
Rain Again

It seems as though our cry might
be RAIN again this week. We’re
seriously contemplating making
someone on the Sports page the
weather man for Albany and the
vicinity so that we would have noth-
ing but nice weather during which
MAA could start getting fellows out
for sports and WAA could have all
the frolics they wanted. Speaking
of frolics leads us to mention the
little fact that last year the WAA
frolic for the frosh also had to be
postponed because of the weather.
One more year and it probably will
become a tradition around State.

From all reports, and comments
made by frosh, it certainly seems as
though frosh camp was enjoyed by
all. Congratulations are in store
for those in charge for doing such
a wonderful job, and keeping all
those frosh from getting homesick
their first weekend at State.
Maybe Basketball

Yes, there are rumors going
around to the effect that we may
have a basketball team, that is if
luck stays with the fellows who are
trying to keep this idea alive. There
may also be a football team—then
we could get some of our State sci-
entists together and develop an
atomic pill so that all our fellows
could win every game . . . State’s
own field-smashers. Wouldn’t that
be wonderful? Everybody would go
to every game—what spirit!

About ’AA

WAA and MAA are the athletic
associations at State. Sports play
an integral part in the life of any
school year; without some type of
sport life, a college would not be
considered worthy of note. This is
one of the reasons both of our as-
sociations have worked so hard try-
ing to offer to you, the students of
State, a, worthwhile sports program.

MAA for the past few years, has
merely existed because of the lack
of men on the campus. Last year.
State began to see the results of
some organization and concentrat-
ed effort on the part of a. group of
interested fellows at State. We had
football games with Siena and Med.,
ping-pong, bowling and pool tour-
neys and State gradually became
interested in MAA's sport life. This
year with the start MAA had last
year, and the cooperation that is
expected from the frosh fellows, we
should see even more action.

As for WAA, it certaile looks as
though a full year has been plan-
ned. There is no actual joining of
WAA for you frosh gals, you know,
as you automatically become asso-
ciate members upon payment of
your student tax. So avail your-
selves of the opportunities present-
ed to you by this organization, and
go out for sports, gals, you won’t
regret it!

Then Too . . .

Incidentally, this page is part of
a paper that is yours. Any sugges-
tions that you might have concern-
ing improvements or new ideas for
Sports page. will be cheerfully ac-
cepted. We would naturally rather
have constructive suggestions, since
they would help rather than hin-
der any work we might try to do.

Again this year, We will welcome
any frosh who would like to work
on Sports page. The quiet and se-
rene atmosphere of lower Draper
should be enough incentive to send
hundreds of volunteers rushing to
the News Office. immediately. So
come on fresh, and let’s have a
frosh’s viewpoint on sports at State.

Frosh To Frolic
On Dorm Field

Continuing its yearly custom,
WAA will play host at a reception
for the women of 1949 tomorrow on
the dorm field from two o’clock un-
til five.

Mary Seymour, ’46, president of
WAA, has urged that all frosh at-
tend so that they will better under-
stand the work that the Athletic
Association is doing. This first get-
together will introduce the frosh to
the athletically minded girls of
State and at the same time intro-
duce the Crimson Tide to WAA.

The day has been divided into
four sections. Each girl, upon reg-
istering, will be given one colored
card, which represents a certain
team. From two until three-thirty,
softball and badminton will be
played. These sports will be under
tille direction of the Athletic Coun-
c1.

After the games of prowess are
over, numerals will be awarded to
the girls of 1948 who earned them
by participating in four sports dur-
ing their first year in college. At
this same time the Sport-lite Flyer
will be distributed to all the frosh.
WAA has presented its year’s ac—
tivities on this mimeographed sheet
in an effort to clear up any further
questions about its extra—curricular
work for the year.

Elinor Binn and Edna Sweeney,
juniors, are in charge of the enter-
tainment, and have promised ’t
half an hour of fun and frolic. Re—
freshments are being served, under
the direction of Wilma Diehl. '48.

Introductions "’49
Meet WAA

The WAA officers for this year,
were elected last year under a new
and stricter program. Each officer
is, therefore, exceptionally qualified
for the office that she holds on
WAA council.

Mary Seymour, ‘46, President of
WAA, has been an active member
smce she was a freshman at State.
She excelled in every sport ill which
she participated. Seymour is us-
sisted by Gcorgcttc Dllllll, '46, an
able vice-president of the Council.
Gette‘s name could usually he soon
in practically every write-up on bus-
kctball games and she is noted for
her excellent sportsmanship.

Tile Junior class this year, is well
represented on Council with two
outstanding members of WAA. Ed-
na Sweeney is treasurer and Betty
Margot acts as officc lluulllgcr.
Sweeney is especially noted for her
guarding on the basketball court:
Margot for her ability to keep both
her scholastic life and her sport
lifc “tops.”

I Representative from tile class of
48 is Wilma chlll, who holds the
office of Secretary. Wilma spark-
pluggcd the ’48'crs last year in most
of the rivalry sport games.

It’s a really grand Council this
year. one on which State is placing
“a hope for an active and success-
ful your.

Frosh Join In Fun“ At Week-end Camp

Softball, Archery
Highlight Sports

The lnost successful frosh week-
end to be held on the Dorm field
began last Fri-day as one hundred
and ninety-eight frosh women mov-
ed into the dorms and began their
college careers.

Spinted ‘49‘ers ignored the rain
that counselors feared might spoil
the weekend, and brought enough
warmth and friendliness with them
to coax the sun out. Saturday morn-
ing. When the weather cleared, the
sports program that had been plan-
ned for them got illto full swing and
the frosh evidenced athletic possi-
billties that will cause some con-
cern in Sophomore circles.

Rivalry Possibilities

The softball game that was ar—
ranged with an intermingling of all
the classes brought to light some
potential sluggers for the future
rivalry game between freshmen and
Sophomores. The teams will prob-
ably be very well matched.

Versatile frosh tried their hand
at archery, another rivalry sport,
and though there are not many
experienced archers among them
there is plenty of time for them to
train for the match and the forty-
