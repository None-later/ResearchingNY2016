Frosli Material

liows Promise

Plans are being completed this
week for intramural football. A11
appeal to the Frosh has been met
with a great deal of enthusiasm in
spite of numerical inferiority. To
date over a dozen eligible fellows
have given their names to Bob Stil-
livan, Men’s Athletic Association
football director. From this list, two
teams will be chosen to compete
against each other and these teams
will be merged to play additional
games with other colleges in the cap-
ital district.

Representatives of Pharmacy Col—
lege. Albany Medical College and
8101111 have assured us that they will
be willing to play regularly schedul-
ed games. Although there is 110111-
ing definite 111,. this time. we hope
to form a league with these schools
which would mean 11 full schedule
this fall.
