T- Formation Plans

I Myskania announces another Student Faculty
Bridge and Tea to be financed with the proceeds
' from the Myskania-frosh football game. The idea
of a Student Faculty Tea was new to State last
year. when itgained approval. Formulated for the
purpose Of furthering student-faculty relationships,
it succeeded in at least starting the ball rolling.

State College has an obvious disadvantage with

a lack of the conventional faculty row where stu-
dents are received socially, and with the scattered
are not members
of organizations that entertain faculty, go through
college thinking of their professors as
talking encyclopediae”, instead of the friendly and
understanding human beings they are.

Seeing the need for more friendly relationships
between the faculty and students, Myskania spon-
sored the first Faculty Bridge and Tea last year,
and then came a second. This showed obvious
interest since it was financed by student contribu-

dormitories. Many students, who

tions.

Myskania has challenged the frosh to a football
game, and will use the proceeds from the admis~
sion to finance the next Student-Faculty Tea to be
held soon. Both teams are preparing for a bang-up
game; in fact, they’re getting banged up in prac-
tice. They're doing it for your entertainment and
your benefit, asking only for cooperation in return.

State's democratic practices are constantly ex-
panding to cover a wider field, and this plan for
meeting the faculty socially is just
in that democratic chain. There is as much to learn
from friendly discussion with professors as there

is from class lectures.

The multifold benefits are plainly seen and
should be appreciated. Here’s your chance to chal-
lenge your- favorite faculty member to a g
bridge, or hear him crack a joke or two.

Each step of improvement in college life, such
as the Student Faculty Tea, brings us nearer the
goal of an ideal college; students should recognize
these opportunities and take the steps whole-heart-

edly.

Goal In Sight

Last night State College once again saw a gleam
of light in the sports program when twelve State
men began basketball practice for the f

We want a basketball team; we’d like a football
team. Other near—by colleges have again initiated
a men’s athletic program, and MAA is offering the
opportunity to State College—~that means you.
However, players alone cannot sustain a sport’s
program, they must have the cooperation 'of a
united student body with spirit and a willingness

to finance the program.

The fellows are willing to organize and give us
a football team to compete in an Intercollegiate
Sports program. Perhaps if the usual State coin-
placcncy is replaced by an cagt-rni-s
improvement, and optimism is the word of the
day, State can soon arrcpt challenges already re»

STATE COLLEGE NEWS, FRIDAY. OCTOBER, 5, 1945

 

‘  Glade-4714

By CULLINAN 85 "1LT

 

For the past few years, the ques-
tion of sororities has been hotly con-
tested on the State College campus.
Sorority women defend it; indepen-
dents question it; always the issue
results in presenting the pros and
cons with no aim in view to improve
the situation. Last week’s colum-
nists adequately presented the con-
troversies involved in this matter.

Following the plan employed in
other colleges and universities——that
of delaying rushing until second or
even third semester—We would like
to present an adaptation of this
idea for State College.

We believe that a plan could be
devised to postpone all sorority rush—
ing until second semester. It seems
to us that this delay would elimin-
ate to a great extent, the fallacies
of the present system.

Each day, particularly at noon and
after college functions, one can see
examples of the superficial “front”
displayed by sorority members dur—
ing these two Weeks of limited. iii-
tense rushing. How misleading this
must be to freshmen, when after
rush period closes, the ever-con-
stant smiles begin to fade! Why not
let the freshmen form their own
friendships and establish true feel-
ings of fellowship before the maze
of sorority confusion descends upon
them? Furthermore, the freshmen
infatuation for student leaders may
lead to their blindly selecting a sor-
rity, merely because of these upper-
classmen.

From the moment a frosh arrives
at State, she is struck by the hush-
hush of sororities. Why keep the
who’s. where’s and what‘s secret?
Let them know who the sorority
members are. where they live, and
what the sorority itself stands for.

Let us now take up the question of
independents. Over half the women
at State remain independent. The
secrecy of sorority rushing lends
undue significance to the part play-
ed by sororities in our college. Many
students, who—given more time—
would prefer to remain non-sorority,
are swept along with the over—pow-
ering wave of sorority socials.

In the scholastic field the fresh-
men suffer even more. Classes and
books become a. minor thought

Perhaps liu- most. significant and
foreboding invent. oi the week was

amidst all the flurry of the social
swirl. Mid-semesters are here be-

fore the freshmen have an oppor-

tunity to realize that the main idea
is to make the grade—not the sor—
ority. True—that marks may suffer
even more by the extended pro-
gram, however we suggest a method
used at Purdue University and oth-
er colleges to eliminate this factor.
Let every freshman maintain a spec-
ific average before being considered
for sorority. We don‘t intend to
make sororities a group of geniuses,
nor does the minimum have to be
particularly high—it would merely
safeguard freshmen from attaching,
an unreasonable amount of signific-
ance to the social life.

Here again we would like to make
use of the Student Guide program.
It is they who should take over
freshmen the first few months—not
the sorority members. Under the
present set-tip Strident Guide activi-
tivity is partially nullified with the
influx of sorority rushing.

Naturally the delayed rushing per
iod could easily lead to a great deal
of "dirty rushing" but with a few
adequate rules it could be cut to such
a minimum as to render it insignifi-
cant. We would like to present the
following rules as a possible basis for
this new program:

1.No definite rushing periods un-
till second semester.

Allow free discussion of all sor-
orities.

.Freshmen should not be allowed
to enter sorority houses or the
private homes of sorority mem-
bers.

.No restrictions on sorority en-
engagements throughout the se-
mester.

No money shall be spent on the
freshmen women by sorority
women.

At the close of first semester
regular rushing periods should
ensue as now stated in sorority
regulations.

We feel in closing, that any va-
grancies committed by sororities dur-
ing this extended period, not only
would be ineffectual and insignifi-
cant but tend to destroy the sorority
they’re trying to promote.

Q}

~—_————- By MINDY wansnaw ——
GUEST COLUMNIST

If you want to know just “what goes” inside Japan,
read the following exerpt from a letter fi'om Ens. Stan
Gipp, ‘45. first State serviceman to set foot on Japan-
ese soil:

“I don’t know the effects the peace will have on
NYSCT’s enrollment this year except that there won’t
be many of us returning under the point system for,
this semester. As anxious as I am to return though,
I believe the powers that be are attacking this prob-
lem the right way—"ind most of the right men are
getting home first. We’ve sent 16 from our ship now;
that’s about 6 per cent of the crew. The Third Fleet
is sailing to arrive in New York on Navy Day, and al-
most every ship will be loaded with Ai‘my and Navy
personnel making their last. trip at government; ex-
pense.

 

 

The old “Patroclus” has had quite a summer cruise.
We left Norfolk sometime in May, stopped off at Pan-
ama. San Diego, San Francisco (for two weeksl,
Pearl Harbor (bumped into Art Olivct, and searched in
vain for John Dooleyl, Guam, Saipan (lay there at
anchor when the peace was declaredl, and then on
to Tokio. We arrived here for the occupation, the
peace signing tin fact we had a berth less than 1000
yards from the “Missouri” during the ceremonies—
saw “Dugout Doug” and “5 Star Nimitz" piped aboard
and everything else that 15 binoculars among 250
men would allowl, and have now settled down in
expectation of a long stay.

Had the thrill of going ashore the first day of occu-
pation, but there wasn’t much opposition—just debris,
stench, and a strong wind. Just about two weeks later
we began granting liberty, and already I’ve seen every-
thing I want to see. There is nothing to do, buy, or
steal left in Japan. I don’t know whether inflation
began with our arrival or not, but right now the
Japs are buying cigarettes from the sailors for 30 yen
a pack (the equivalent of $2 if exchanged aboard
ship), and the few shops that are still standing won't
sell a chopstick for less than 50 yen. Every Jap has a
pocket full of yen, probably because there is nothing
for him to buy—the only food and clothing available
is what he raises or makes himself.

A number of the fellows have probably written you
of the ruins of Tokio and Yokohama, but I’in sure
you haven’t any idea of their extent. I was told two
days before I visited those places just what they
looked like and still was surprised when I saw for
myself. In Yokohama there isn’t a house standing
. . The buildings are leveled off to the ground,
only the stone foundations remaining. and the na-
tives have salvaged the corrugated tin roofs and
thrown them together to resemble shelter. The pov-
erty and filth are unimaginable—the eyes can‘t see the
whole story; it’s the nose that realizes.

We‘ve run into several English speaking Japs (one
who graduated from Cornelli. and a few American.
English, and German civilians trapped or imprisoned
here at the outbreak of the war. Their stories are
wicrd. but all agree in claiming that despite the condi-
tions here they were surprised when peace was de—
clured. It. seems that. four dnvs before, thov were told
that the Japs were at. the gates of“ the Cnpiiol «guess

Dr. Blodgell'lnlroduces Miracle! l’

«are» ' ‘

Of "Invisible" Gloss To Students '

Nylon, penicillin, plastics, and
other such terms have become a
part of our daily life, through the
inventiveness of Science, and still
another has been added—“invisible”
glass. State was formally intro-
duced to this term at a lecture
Tuesday night by Dr. Katherine
Burr Blodgett, the woman who
gave the world “invisible” glass.

Dr. Blodgett accomplished this
miracle of Science by working with
molecules, and films with the thick-
ness of eight millionths of an inch.
It is difficult enough for most peo—
plc to grasp the idea of molecules.
But Dr. Blodgett not only under-
stands molecules, slie make them
obey her commands! Invisible as
they are. she builds them up in
layers like bricks held together by
mortar. And then, when the wall
is built. she whisks the mortar
away, so that each particle is in
suspension. If that isn’t magic,
what is? Scientists believe it a
near miracle.

Dr. Blodg'ett is a, very feminine,
charming person with a most pleas-
ing voicel. To meet her .you’d
never guess that this petite, mod-
est person just six years ago dis-
covered a method of coating glass
which makes it invisible and which
put her name at the head of the
list of outstanding women of 1939.

The result of Dr. Blodgett’s ex-
periments will be of great use in
everyday life. Although the pro-
cess is still in the laboratory stage,
it is hoped that it will soon be of-
fered to the public. When the new
glass is placed on the market
will make it possible to see pic-

Katerina Blodgett was born in
Schenectady 42 years ago. After
attending a private school in New
York City and then Bryn Mawr,
she received her Master of Arts de-
gree at the University of Chicago.
Her first position was assistant to
Dr. Irving Langmuir of the Gen-
eral Electric Company in Schenec-
tady, where she first came in con-
tact with the molecular film. Seven
yenrs later she won the privilege of
studying at the Cavendish Institute
of Cambridge University, England,
and was the first woman ever to be
awarded the Degree of Doctor of
Philosophy by that Institute.

Dr. Blodgett has achieved out-
standing recognition as the discov-
erer of a long-souglit-for process
for making invisible glass. Before
long the public will add this term
to their list of new scientific mir-
holes!
