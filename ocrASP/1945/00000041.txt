PROGRAM SPONSOR.

Since this week's column is being written from a
sick bed (the housemother says the bed is sicker than
me) the only material available to write about is the
content of the early morning housewife's radio pro-
grams. Dld you know that “Life Can Be Beautiful?"
Well. it can; ask your grocer all about it; it comes
in six delicious flavors. “John’s Other Wife” is food
for thought. but if you really want to get a practical
education. stay home from tomorrow morning’s classes
and tune in to. “Nora Naughton—The Girl Who Didn’t
Know What She Wanted Until She Got It.” You'll
really learn something.

STAMPEDE

Did you know that on Wednesday morning, while
you were taking notes in class. Albany housewives
were knocking each other's teeth otit over 300 pairs
of nylon stockings that were unexpectedly delivered
to a downtown department store? The sign “NYLONS”
was placed in a comspieuous spot in the store win-
dow and at first (for the first two seconds) no one paid
any attention to it. Then one eager beaver rushed
inside to see if it was true, and the mad scramble
was on. (Put that bus token back in your pocket and
pull in your fangs, Hagerty it’s too late now—-they
were all sold out in five minutes . . . l

INTERNATIONAL MOVEMENT

There are a group of women over in a certain part
of England who are forming an organization called
the “Angry Wives Club.” They are the wives of
American soldiers, and they are angry because they're
having a lot of trouble trying to get to the United
States where they can become re-united with their
husbands. Would you like to know just how many little
lassies there are over in England who have become
the better halves of American boys? Probably a
couple of hundred. you think to yourself (well. I did,
anyhow! This is a slight understatement. There are
54.000 (fifty-four thousandi of them . . . that‘s all.
Well. don't fret—you believe in internatiormlism. don’t
you? This is all one world, you know. But I feel sorry
for the fifty-four thousand of us that got gypped . . .
ioh well, we can always become sehoolteachers—i

LOST AN I) FOUND

Didia hear the one about the embarrassed fresh—
mani It seems she had a little trouble finding her
gym class and so she walked and walked through all
the buildings until she found someone to direct her.
“The gym is that way.“ said the informer, and the
freshir-an followed. As she lined up with the rest of
the girls. she noticed a certain youtlifulness about. her
comrades. in fact. she was embnrrused to note that
she was the only one wearing lipstick. "Say." she
whispered to the girl on the left of tier. “do you mind
if I ask you a personal question how old are you?"
"Fifteen!" whispered the girl on the left of her.
“Fifteen!” said the frosh. “and they let you into State
college‘.” "Strife College?" lliundrcd the girl on the
left of her." for cryin‘ out 1(lllfl this is Milne High
School." The freshman left the room.

ITATE COLLEGE NEWS. FRIDAY. OCTOBER 12. 104!

 

eachqu 7004M

Apparently not satisfied with the
complete reports submitted individ-
ually by the Army and Navy. the
U. S. Congress has now appointed a
Congressional Joint Pearl Harbor
Investigating committee. One would
have difficulty finding a committee
which will have more trouble ac-
complishing less.

To Start Hearings

The committee members are to fly
to Pearl Harbor, the scene of the in-
famous attack. and start committee
hearings this month. Both the Army
and Navy committees did their in-
vestigating immediately after the
disaster when the men present and
possibly responsible Were still avail-
able, when there was a need for such
probing.

What the present committee hopes
to accomplish is indeed a puzzle.
Having spent over a month in that
immediate region back in 1944 and
having flown over the region again
a few weeks ago. I got the impres-
sion that the terrific damages sus-
tained by the U. S. in the December
7th attack have long since been re-
moved. Only a few extremely minor
scars still remain. The island has
become one of the greatest fortresses
and strongest arsenals in existence.
serving as a major base for the great
Pacific offensives. It requires no
military observer to appreciate the
strength that has been concentrated
nor the prodigious job the U. S. has
accomplished in erasing the damages
inflicted by the Japanese.

Few Men Remain

In all probability. few of the men
present on December 7th are still
there—most of them having gone
elsewhere and made distinguished
service records.

In short. about the only thing rc-
inaining is the name. Perhaps the
congressmen are flying to Hawaii for
the atmosphere and the Pearl Har-
bor background. for they will cer-
tainly have difficulty fixing re-
sponsibility for the attack. In this
respect, they might, do better to
stay home and read thc Army and

—— By LT. HARRY PASSOW —

Navy reports which are complete
and accurate. failing in only one re-
spect—they name no scapegoatl The
responsibility for the attack on Pearl
Harbor still remains with the Jap-
anese and the responsibility for the
degree of success they met must
rest, not with the scapegoats, but
with the American people for un-
preparedness.

It is to be hoped that the Con-
gressmen enjoy Hawaii—it's nicest
this time of the year.

Discuss Bases

More to the point. the Pacific
should shortly figure in another de-
bate—What to do with the Pacific
bases?

The Navy has submitted a plan
for a string of major bases extend-
ing from Okinawa to Hawaii plus a
number of minor basis. It is difficult
to reach a decision as to the dis-
position of these atolls and islands.
Having been won at a staggering
cost in blood and materials. it seems
inconceivable that these potential
military bases—many with anchor-
ages equal to that of Pearl Harbor,
and most with airstrips capable of
handling fleets of aircraft — shall
now be returned to Japan, who
either owned or mandated the is-
lands and atolls. On the other hand.
to acquire these bases. to maintain
and build them up, is to commit the
United States to a military program
which would be greater than any-
thing we have yet conceived.
Suggested Solution

The solution would be to interna-
tionalize these islands and atolls and
turn them over to a United Nations
organization capable of adequate su-
pervision. The decision might be
easier were a strong United Nations
organization already present. ready
to accept responsibility for the ad-
ministration and welfare of these
economically poor but potentially
powerful military bases. This is an-
other obstacle to peace which can
best be eliminated by honest. con-
certed action of all the responsible
nations involved.

To The Fresh

Tomorrow is the time for the freshman class to
launch its career in the extra-curricular world of
State College. Activities Day is opportunity
knocking, and the ClaSS of ’49 must answer the
summons. '

For many years State College has been one of
the few colleges widely known for its democratic
student government, freedom of the press, with a
newspaper managed entirely by students, and
many other college organizations which compose
the intricate machinery of campus life.

However, the organizations on campus must be
efficient and purposeful in order to remain; this
is difficult to accomplish with a yearly changing
student body. Upperclassmen can keep alive trad-
itions and group policies while they are here, but
there must be trained people to fill their positions
When graduation times comes all too soon.

Heads of organizations will be stationed at tables
in the Commons tomorrow to explain the workings
of the dlfferent groups to the freshmen. They will
willingly answer questions, but, remember they
have a place in the extra-curricular field and can
only help you, the fresh, to find yours. The indivi-
duals of the Class of ’49 must show the necessary
interest.

Four years of college, perhaps even five years,
seems like a very long time, and the usual human
procrastination calls out “that time will wait until
you are ready to start." That is not true, fresh, as
you will see. in order to develop a true interest
anti ability in an organization, training and experi-
ence should begin now. For Sophomores it is a bit
difficult to find a niche in an already working
group, for Juniors it: is very difficult, and for Sen-
iors. practically impossible to break into the extra-
curricular activities.

The freshman year is a trial period for deter-
mining whether or not an organization fulfills ex-
pectations and aspirations. College life with its
traditional Activities Day gives students a chance
to sign-up for activities and glimpse each; then
settle in one or two.

The exti'a-Ciiri‘iCiilzir participation of freshmen
has l\\'t)l()l(l advantages, that development in per-
sonality and character which it gives to the student,
and the new ideas and spirit which the frosh can
give to the organization. ‘

Ho sign-up. frosli. and let's have an lit‘lin‘ vczir
lll'll w'll keep State College right tip on top.

lGC Conference

Stoddard Will Introduce
Mrs. Roosevelt NOV. 3

Dr. George D. Stoddard, Commis-
sioner of Education, will introduce
Mrs. Eleanor Roosevelt. closing
speaker, in Page Hail Saturday.
November 3, at the first Student
Conference on Inter-Group Rela-
tions sponsored by Inter-Group
Council. The conference will bring
delegates from the eleven New York
State Teachers Colleges.

The opening speaker of the con-
ference will be Dr. John W. Davis,
President of West Virginia State
Teachers College. West Virginia
State Teachers College, like State,
is one of the nine teachers colleges
chosen by the committee on Teach-
er Education of the American Coun-
cil of Education to participate in
the College Project in Inter-Group
Relations.

Mrs. Helen Slack Shure, Presi-
dent of Student Association, and
Mrs. Shirley Passow, Chairman of
Inter-Group Council. will represent
State College. Both Seniors were
elected by the executive board of
Inter-Group Council at its meetin
Wednesday.

Mrs. Shure is also chairman of
the conference. Mrs. Passow will
explain to the delegates the place
that State is taking in Inter-Group
planning.

When Dr. Stoddard was inter-
viewed this week by members of
Inter-Group Council, he expressed
approval of the objectives of the
organization. He commented that
the effort to democratize inter-
group living is one of the necessary
features of teacher education. Em-
phasizing this job of education, he
declared that future teachers
should know and treat their pupils
as Mary and Abie—people—instead
of judging them according to where
they come from or how they wor-
ship God.

Committees working on the con—
ference are: Invitations, Shirley
Gross. '47, chairman, Betty Rose
Diamond, Joyce McDonald. and
Mary Bess Vernoy, Seniors. and

Minor Serenade Nightly:
By Four Mysterious Fumes

“Come on, girls, get around
the phone—it’s time to call our
own Jim Miner." And so it
starts—“Umbriagol"~the night-
ly serenade given by four beau-
tiful B.T.O.’s. The object of
these phone calls to the Annex
every night is still a deep mys-
. tery. Maybe they just like Jim’s
red hair -— whatever it is, the
girls are faithful about their re-
hearsals. Everybody suffers
while the croon'ers croon with
limited repertoire consisting of
“Skidamore Rink a Dink” and
“Swannee.” with a slight change
of words.

Jim must be taking the whole
thing seriously. giving a recip-
rocal performance on one occa-
sion. when he and his buddies
sang 'a song that would inspire
any quartet to the artistic
heights of performance.

So, come on kids, keep your
eyes and ears open—maybe you
can find out who the four girls
are whose motto is “A way to a
man’s heart is with song.”
