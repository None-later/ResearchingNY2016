- That was a nice game—it must

have been—everybody says so. The
' frosh-Myskania game we mean. Of
course. we would have liked it much
Wbetter if one of the teams had
scored but maybe that will happen
another time—and from the looks
or the fresh challenge this morn-
ing, we may expect to have another
soon. But there’s the possibility
that these two teams may have to
take two or three weeks off before
tney can play another game. From
the groans heard as we walk along
the corridors, and- the sight of black
eyes (which incidentally are rather
embarrassing especially when the
kids in the classroom look wistfully
up and say, “Miss Ber- - -, didn't
we see you playing football yester-
day?”) we would judge that maybe
a rest period would not be laughed
at. Then there are those we call
professionals . . .

If we may, we’d like to make a
little suggestion concerning the
throngs that watch the games. It
seems that several times in the
course of the game, the runner was
forced to run into the crowd in an
effort to get by the secondary. The
crowd had moved in and narrowed
the field, so that side plays were
almost impossible to make. The
field wasn‘t marked, and that may
have been the excuse.

About Predictions

Notice please the wonderful pre-
diction that Hess made in his col-
umn this week—he predicted that
Detroit would win the World Series.
This is even more astounding since
his column had to be in Tuesday
morning. Witness all those other
horrible predictions in former years
that made our faces so red, and
maybe then it will be understood
why We were so happy for George
when the Series ended the way it
did. We must confess, however,
that it didn’t end the way we want-
ed it to end—yes—the awful truth,
we really wanted Chicago to win.
Oh, well, maybe next year the team
we bet our perfectly good nickel
on will win.

Football Fun

There seems to be some kind of a
football craze that’s hit several of
the group houses—and that's good
or is it? Everybody is challenging
everybody else to a game of foot-
ball and it sounds wonderful. One
of the group houses has figured out
a system—«each of the four classes
represented in the house is getting
a team together. The fresh will
play the Sophs. the Juniors play
the Seniors and the winners of these
games will play each other. This
seems to be a very good idea. This
way, the whole house is disabled at
the same time, simplifying matters
greatly. The doctors could make
the rounds in the same day. Psi
Gain is also thinking of challenging
Chi Sig to a game which will prob-
ably end up as a free for all with
V.I., Milne and Med. subs.

Sports should be played as they
tend lo foster a relaxed feeling on
the port of the purlicipmils~ build
up muscles. and promote sports-
munship.

Nice game football!

Don't forget—sill those frosh who
are interested in trying out for the
Sports Staff of the News. sign up
tomorrow —— Activities Day, in the
Commons. Those who have already
stated they wish to tryout. must
also sign up. Later in the semester
these people will be notified with
regard to cub classes and actual
sports writing. Remember—sign up!

(Continued from p ,1. I], Col. /,)
nearest it has ever come to actual
completion. The players nurroivod
down to Gerry Callahan and F10
Gari‘nll. Because of numerous mix-
ups in dates, this game was never
decided. If the tournament was
completed this year. the tennis cup
might again come into circulation.
Playoffs Urged

Since only one game has been
played so far. Gerry Callahan. ‘47,
and Wanda Tomasik, ’49. urge that
all first matches be played off by
the middle of next week.

Watch the WAA bulletin board
for further notice of the progress of
the tournament.

 rash _ootball Game
 Score Tied O - O,

Seymour, Seaman
Sparkplug, Team'

' By ART KAUFMAN

In a. hotly contested football
game the Myskania Marauders and
the high spirited Crimson Tide of
’49 played to a scoreless tie. The
opinion of the spectators showed
that the Crimson Tide was the su-
perior team throughout. They cut-
played Myskania in every field and
had control of the ball most of the
time. Their running attack was
cleverly executed only to be slowed
down by the sloppy condition of the
field.

Stittig kicked off for the Crimson
Tide and the ball was taken by
O’Neil on the Marauders’ 35-yard
line. She carried it to the midfield
stripe where she was swarmed over
by the whole frosh team. Here the
Crimson line held and Myskania
was forced to kick on the fourth
down. On the exchange of punts
Myskania gained 10 yards. The
fresh then took over and made the
first down of the day on a pass
from Seaman to Glover.

Second Quarter

In. the early part of the quarter
Seymour returned Stittig’s punt to
the 20-yard line of the Crimson
Tide. Myskania began to move
goalward and made their only first
down of the day, moving the ball
down to the 5-yard line. At this
point, the Crimson Tide line, con-
sisting of Cook. Harris. and Glover,
made a goal line stand and held
the Marauders back. Here. the
Crimson team took over, forced to
kick from the end zone. Stittig got
off a beautiful kick that carried to
the 49-yard line. Myskania began
to move once again only to be
thwarted by the superb defensive
ability of the entire fr05h team.
Third Quarter

The second half opened with Sey-
mour kicking to the 40-yard line of
the Crimson Tide. The frosh then
began to move on a series of spin-
ner and reverse plays with Seaman,
Whelley and Sittig carrying the
ball. Whatever gain made was
nullified by holding penalties. Later
in the quarter. the Crimson Tide
put on a scoring threat when Molly
Whelley recovered a fumble on the
Marauders' 25-yard line. This
threat was dampened by another
penalty for holding.

Fourth Quarter

The early part of the last quarter
found the Crimson Tide penetrating
deep into scoring territory. The
Marauders stayed off the march
with Berbrich and O’Neil sparking
the defense. The climax of the
game came in the closing moments
when Stittig returned Seymour‘s
punt for what looked like the win-
ning touchdown. only to have it
recalled to the point where the ball
was caught.

Hats Off Department

Hats off to both teams for the
sportsmanship shown in benefit of
the Student-Faculty Tea.

Ditto to Bob Sullivan. Frank
Woodworth, and Jack Tabner. who
gave their time to mold the teams
into shape.

()nlookcr's Viewpoint

Mickey Seaman was the outstand-
ing player of the day. She (lid an
excellent job of field goneraiship us
well as running the bull.

Molly Whelley played a fine de-
i‘vnsivc game and deserves mention.

liev Stittig was outstanding as u
punter. It was Mr punting from
behind the goal line that saved the
Crimson Tide from being scored
upon.

Seymour sparked the Mnrunders'
offensive. lIer passing and kicking
kept them alive.

Griffin. llerlirieh and O’Neil were
all outstanding on the dei’ensivo for
Marauders.

Football Tie May
Be Played Soon

The following challenge will be
presented to Myskania today in
Assembly:

“The Class of 1949 challenges
Myskania to a return football match
to be played on the 23rd day of
October, 1945. The same rules shall
prevail as for the game played on
the 9th day of October, 1945, with
the provision that no less than two
referees be in attendance at all
times."

This resolution was signed by
both Mickey Seaman. ’49, Captain,
and Frank Woodworth, ’47, Coach.

Thus, it seems that even the frosh
were not satisfied with the results
of the game this past Tuesday.
Whether Myskania will accept the
challenge remains to be seen, but
from the looks of things another
game is forthcoming.

As both teams sustained numer—
ous injuries (mentioned elsewhere
on this pagel. it is doubtful if
either one will be able to field a
satisfactory team. Myskania is at
a decided disadvantage because of
lack of substitutes.

So, come out, see a good game,
and listen to the bones break.

Margot Requests Students
To Call For Their Numerals

Betty Margot, ‘47. has asked .111
those who have not us yet received
their numerals for inst your. to
drop her a note via the student mull.

These numerals \vere awarded to
a few students at the WAA Frolic
for the frosh several weeks ago, but
th°re are still many entitled to the
numerals who lulvc not recch'cd
them.

Numerals are given for participa-
tion in fun sports for one your.

Sproins, Strains Highlight
Unscheduled Football Match

It was a cool, brisk day. Just
ideal football weather. So . .
six hardy, stalwart Saylesites
slipped and sweated on the dorm
field Sunday afternoon, to offer
some opposition to Sullivan’s
Myskanites.

Trick plays and snappy passes
gave the Seniors an advantage
over the disorganized Sayles
squad.

“Slacki-e" passed to Seymour
for the first touchdown. But
their joy was short-lived as
Sylvestrie snabbed a long pass
from Shapiro and ran the field
for a tally. The ball see-saWed
back and forth with the “sales-
men’s" backs against their goal.

Myskania started to roll and
rushed down the field making
three first downs. Griffin snar-
ed a pass for a long gain and
set her team up in SCOl‘llig posi-
tion. Slackie ran the ball over
for the final touchdown.

The girls rose battered and
bruised. but satisfied that their
scrimmage had been both sooth-
ing and satisfactory.

We’re not calling this column a
guest column, because George Hess
is not a guest—he just has a “leave
of absence” for a while. Also before
reading the column, fix firmly in
the mind that it was written before
the final playoff of the World Scr-
tes, in order to get here in time for
this week’s NEWS!—E’d. Note.

When Ye Editor Sullivan asked
us to contribute a guest column we
immediately decided that here was
the opportunity to deliver a long
needed apology. So here goes. . . .

Last Spring Messrs. Woodworth,
Lashinsky. Vaughn, Sullivan,.Bro-
phy, and about every other male in
State. including Yours Truly, had
a brilliant idea. We had visions of
hordes of men cavorting on foot-
ball field and basketball court. We
Were so entranced with that vision
that we actually thought it would
work. Then, like the dreamers we
were. We publicized the whole busi-
ness. It caught on and seemed to
spread like wildfire. The News
carried a story, with a banner head,
no less, that forecast the return of
intercollegiate basketball.

That wasn't the end of it by far.
on no, we had to have money to
work the thing out. When we cast
about for ideas on raising funds the
thought struck us that perhaps the
whole student body would like a.
part of it. The light had dawned;
there were no more worries. One
lovely Spring morning a collection
was taken in the student assembly.
We garnered enough nickles. dimes
and quarters that Friday morning
to finance a half dozen such cam-
paigns Well, one at least).

The enthusiasm we had was un—
bounded. Form letters were writ-
ten, stenciled. signed. sealed and
mailed. Ah yes! The graduates of
N.Y.S.C.'I‘. would send athletes to
their clamoring Alma Mater. There
wasn't a doubt in our minds. But,
as everyone knows, something went
wrong, and there's where the apol—
ogy comes in. We want to ask for—
giveness for ourselves and our col-
leagues. We ask forgiveness for
only 23 males. good as they may be,
in the Class of '49. But may the
war-cry of the Brooklyn Dodgers
ever be in your hearts: “Wait'll
next year!"

'l‘hree Errors

As we write this tears course
down our face, for the Detroit Tig-
ers are leading in the World Series
three games to two for the Cubs.
We had suffered much during the
sczison just passed. The Giants,
who we had picked to win the Na-
iiunnl League flag. had stayed far
out of the lead and eventually fin-
ished fifth. Insult was added to
inortnl injury when our other pen-
nant selection, the Yankees. finish-
ed fourth in the American League.
But. we thought, the stumbling.
groping Tigers will never beat a
smooth ball club like Chicago, hence
the tours. Perhaps. with the two
chances the Cubs still have. . . .

A meeting of the Business.
Advertising, und Circulation
stuffs of the S'rn'rn Comnun News
will be held Tuesday at noon
in Room 111. This meeting is
compulsory for all staff mem-
bers and heads.

 

To Climax Campus Day Events

“Calling all Sophsl Calling all
fresh! Man your battle stations!"

Inter-class rivalry will commence
officially as State’s twenty-sixth
Campus Day begins with the ath-
letic events—before the freshmen
and Sophomores are maimed, and
maybe mournful over a lost banner.
Ladies first will prove their am-
bidexterity and prowess in three-
legged relay, shoe, blindfold, old
clothes, and sack races. All Sophs
and frosh will participate, and
there is an opportunity for each—
if one isn't very good in the other
races, she gets the sack. Then the
men of '49 will pit their football
finesse and sports spirit against
that of the Sophs.

When the rival classes have re-
cuperated from the field events,
they will return to the fray to
search for the hidden banners.
Here the Red Devils will find them-
selves in the midst of a “crowd—a
host of Golden Daffodils.” Never-
theless they are required to leave
their pitchforks home. Only the
most subtle methods of mayhem
will be missed by Myskania. Sparky.
John, and MeClintock will try to
conceal the ’48 banner in such a
way as to baffle the green Red
Devils and send them home feeling
very blue.

In the evening. Queen Mary, last
year’s campus sovereign. will leave

that chem lab (in Rensselaer this
time, not Huested), and place the
circlet on the newly elected queen.
Only at 8 P. M. will the student
body learn the identity of the one
chosen, as the strains of “Pomp and
Circumstance" usher her in with
her court. From her vantage point
on the stage, the new queen, radiant
in satin, ermine, and sparkling
crown, will reign over the class
skits in state.

In describing the Sophomore skit,
the chairman said, “It will be ab-
solutely the most scintillating,
stimulating, stupendous, super-col-
ossal display of Sophomoric talent
ever presented to the reigning
queen. The frosh won't even need
to give a skit—" Here she ran out
of breath, and a freshman, ready
with a fresh supply, exploded with,
“All of us are working hard on ours,
and it can’t help but be a rip roar-
ing success. judging from the suc-
cess of the past appearances of the
frosh.”

Statements like these are known
in the Old English period as the
heroic boast, and are in line with
the best heroic tradition.

After the presentation of the
skits, the students will receive the
decision of the judges, and grand
finale will be dancing in the gym.
where the classes will celebrate the
outcome of the day’s events.

 

 

Junior Class Will Feature
Traditional Spring Formal

The Class of '47 will bring to
State next spring one of its lost
traditions.

For the first time since 1943,
the green is coming through to
reinstate the custom of their
predecessors. In fact, plans are
now underway for a Junior
Prom Weekend to be held next
spring.

Coronation of the Junior Class
Queen will take place at the
Prom as in the past rather
than at the Junior Big 8.

Once again, State College
maidens may don billowy skirts
and maybe even a corsage for
the good old Junior Prom and
weekend events.

 

Gemmell Leaves

in Commerce. will leave State Col-
lege November 1 to take up his new
duties as Associate Professor in

State in January, 1942. He received
his Bachelor of Science in Coin-
merce at the University of Wyom—
ing and obtained his Master of Sci-
ence degree in Education here at

enjoyed my work at State very
much and I consider the State Col-
lege student. of high caliber. It is
my opinion that there is going to
be a tremendous change in all the
departments. particularly in Ensi-
ness Educution. For a State Col-
lege, an instructor enjoys a. degree
of academic freedom here that is
not found in most State institu-
tions."
