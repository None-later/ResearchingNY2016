   ‘ Shrivenllam UniverSity § In England

 

During the summer while the
State students1 were blissfully en-
joying their Vacations. Milton G.
Nelson, Dean’ of the College, left
for“ England to take up the tempo-
rary position as a member of the
Shriveimam Army University, Eng-
land. which is located between Ox-
ford and Bath.

The University is now in the
second eight-weeks term. The first
term, which began August 1, term-
inated at the end of September.
Between semesters there was a
week vacation. which Dean Nelson
used .to the best advantage by
taking a trip to Scotland. Harry
W. Hastings, Professor of English,
who is also located at the Univer-
sity, accompanied Dean Nelson on
this trip to Edinburgh, Loch Lo‘
mond and other points of interest.
On their return to England, they
stopped at Chester to visit Profes-
sor Bradbury, who is now teaching
at the Liverpool University and has
previously taught three Summer
Sessions at State.

Week End Trips

Weekend trips supplied further
opportunities to take in the sur-
rounding points of interest. Such
trips were made to Windsor Castle,

Eton College, Winchester College.
Oxford University, London, and
Stratford. During their visit to

Stratford they were fortunate
enough to see a presentation of
“Much Ado About Nothing” in the
Shakespearean Theater.

The Shrivenham Army Univer-
sity enrollment consisted of 3,600
American soldiers for the first
semester. Soldiers stationed in the
European Theatre may obtain per-
mission to attend one term at the
University. Since his arrival in
August, Dean Nelson has met
several men from State.

School Schedule

Although Dean Nelson has had
the opportunity to do quite a bit
of sight seeing, his stay in England
has been by no means all play and
no work. The school day begins
with reveille at 6 A. M. Afterwards
Dr. Nelson goes to his office where
he remains for the entire day ex-
cept when he is teaching. He
teaches three classes each day—
one in School Administration and
two in Principlcs of Secondary
Education. "

According to Mrs. Nelson, the
Shrlvcnham University is the first
school of its kind. The purpose of
the University is to permit the sol-
diers stationed overseas to continue
with their 'educatlon. The enroll—
ment is open to officers as well as
enlisted men.

Expects Returns

Although Dean Nelson went to
England exj‘iccihul to slay
semesters, as thinis look now ll.
is expected that Ihc University will
close at the end of Iin- second tcrm.
If this is the casc. he will lI-avc
Enralal‘ul before Christmas and will
probably rcLIu'u to Albany bclorc
the first of the your.

Shakespeorion
Exhibit To Open
In Droperlodoy

An exhibit of Shakespearian pic-
tures and materials will open in
Room 207, Draper, today under the
sponsorship of Dr. Vivian C. Hop-
kins. Miss Ruth Hutchins, head of
the Art Department, has announc-
ed that her department will also
display a collection of photographs
of Peruvian silver of the Spanish
colonial period at this time.

Dr. Hopkins’ Shakespeare Class
will set up the portraits and pic-
tures of her exhibit. The photo-
graphs of the Peruvian silver con-
sists of several plates from the
collection of Dr. Watt Stewart,
head of the Social Studies Depart—
ment.

Shukespearian Exhibit

The Shakespearian exhibit in-
cludes picture post cards of London
and Stratford, views of the Eliza-
bethan stage, pictures of Eliza-
bethan costumes, and modern cos—
tumes and staging. Some prints of
the life and times of Shakespeare
will also be shown, including a
portrait of Queen Elizabeth, typical
sailing vessels, and court scenes.
Views of the Folger Library in
Washington. District of Columbia,
including the model stage and
murals, will be displayed with a
few pictures of such modern
Shakespearean actors as John Giel-
gud and Maurice Evans.
Photographs

The exhibit sponsored by the Art
Department consists of photo-
graphs ol‘ Peruvian silver from the
16th, 17th, and 18th centuries. Sil-
ver craftsmanship at this time was
a very skilled art and many ornate
and intricate designs were created
then which are often used for table
services today. There will be plates
of Permian incense burners, eating
utensils, spurs and stirrups and
many other articles which were
used in colonial times in homes of
the wealthier people. Some of these
p.eces today are to be found in
antique shops in Lima or are owned
by the very wealthy.

Dr. Stewart obtained this fine col-
lection of plates from Dr. Taylor,
21 former instructor here, who pur—
chased them while in the service in
Italy.

Intelligent Voting
Prevents Quote

In Late Election

'49 Cast: Blank Ballots
Nullilying Voting Results

The Student Board of Finance
election which was held last Friday
resulted in one of the oddest and
most unusual set-ups that State Col-
lege has ever experienced. Results,
as they now stand, are open to in-
terpretation from several different
angles.

State College's Constitution states
that votes are to be re-distributed
until some candidate has achieved
a quota In last Friday’s election.
no candidate received a quota;
therefore, no candidate has been
elected to the position of Junior
member of the Student Board of Fl-
nance.

Quota Presents Problem

This is a situation seldom en-
countered since the quota is (the
number of votes cast) divided by
(the number of people to be elected
plus one) plus one—or 736 (votes
cast) divided by two (one candi-
date to be elected plus one) plus
one, which equals 369. In this elec-
tion, however, the total number of
blanks in the last distribution num-
bered 82, approximately eleven per
cent of the votes cast. This large
a number of blanks prevented any
candidate from receiving a quota.
The majority of these blanks occur-
red after the first distribution. many
after the second distribution.

At first glance, this seems to in-
dicate a lack of knowledge concern-
ing the operation of the preferential
ballot and a lack of interest in vot-
ing among members of Student As-
sociation. Further study of the sit-
uation. however, leads one to draw
an entirely different conclusion.
Blank Ballots Kill Election

Since the blanks seemed to fall
in definite groups, it is logical to
assume that the majority of blanks
were cast by the freshmen. In other
words, the freshmen, not knowing
several of the candidates running
for the office, listed the ones they
knew and left blank all the others.
This is intelligent voting since votes
should be cast only when a knowl-
edge of the candidate’s ability is
known to the voter.

Although the large number of
blanks prevented any candidate
from receiving a quota, and a re-
election will have to be held, the
extra work and time that will be ex-

Faculty, Students
To Attend Tea

Myskania Will Direct
Tllird Event In Series

Myskania will sponsor a student
faculty tea Nov. 1 in the Lounge
from 2:30 PM. to 5:00 P.M. This will
mark the third event of a series,
initiated last year to further stu-
dent-faculty relationships.

The first tea, held as an experi-
ment last November, was also spon-
sored by Myskania. As it was con-
sidered a success by both the fa-
culty and the student body a second
meeting, made possible by student
contributions, was held in February.
Following this precedent, the pro-
ceeds of the Myskania-frosh football
game will defray the expenses of
the first tea this year. There will
be at least two more gatherings of
this sort next semester.

Students will have the opportunity
to speak with the members of the
faculty whom they already know,
and to meet those with whom they
wish to become acquainted. They
are invited to challenge members of
the faculty to a bridge game, or to
discuss their problems with them.

Dr. Caroline Lester, Instructor in
Mathematics, Miss Annette Dobbin,
Instructor in French and Spanish,
Dr. Mary Goggln, Professor of Latin.
and Miss Ellen C. Stokes. Dean of
Women, will pour.

These events are a part of a pro-
gram, inaugurated two years ago in

 

 

Clubs To Hold
lnitial Meetings
For This Year

TWO departmental clubs have an-
nounced their plans for coming ac-
tivities The French Club will hold
its first meeting of the year Wed-
nesday at 3:30 PM. in the Lounge,
and Chemistry Club, at a meeting
this week, formulated plans for the
initiation of its new members.

Laura Heermance, '47, president
of French Club, states that Miss
Constance Titterington, a former
student of State College. will speak
at the meeting of "Le Cercle Fran-
cals" on her experiences as a Stu-
dent at McGill University in Ottawa.
Canada. Following the lecture, the
group will sing traditional French
songs and popular American songs
with French words. Games will be
played and refreshments served.

In the future, the club expects to
show several movies on Canada.
Tentative plans are also being made
for a joint Christmas Party with
the Spanish and Classical Clubs.

At its meeting this week, final

He started out as a teacher and
ended up in the Canadian Army!
So began the trials and tribulations
of one Frank Hardmeyer. former
State man, class President of '36,
and member of Myskanla.

When September, 1940, rolled
around. Frank, firm in his belief
that the U. S. would enter the war,
went to Montreal to enlist in the
Black Watch Regiment, a crack
infantry unit in the Canadian
Army, and became a "Lady From
Hell." After intensive training. he
was sent overseas to England.
There he took part in the historical
raid on Dieppe. Captured in 1942
by the Germans, he spent two
years and eight months in a prison
camp near Breslau. While there,
Frank reported that the German
officers in charge kept the captives'
hands chained together for one
year. Alter that things cased up a
bit. The prisoners were given sup-
plies scnt by the Red Cross and
were told to amuse themselves.

So. to quote Frank. “We became
sharks at bridge, chess and poker."
They were allowed to go to school
and get college credit or work for
the Germans—but at 7 cents a day
“not many of the fellows took to
that idea." He said that at one
time many of the prisoners went
around spouting verses from the
Bible. predicting the end of the
war. Being an ardent fan of the
Drama, Frank enllstcd the aid of
a fellow prisoner. Jerry Johnson.
Mae West's leading man at one
time, and together they directed
and acted in camp plays put on by
their fellow internees. Frank was
discharged from the Canadian Ar-

clvlllan’s privilege for one day. He
then enlisted in the U. S. Army-—
but was again discharged when
Japan surrendered. The former

Former Classmate Of  > I 'y

Broadcasts German Prepaganda

It is strange to think that one
of your classmates might turn out
to be a traitor to his country. Yet
this is exactly what happened to a
classmate of Dr. James A. Hicks,
Professor of Guidence.

While Mr. Hicks was attending
Grinnell College in Iowa, there Was
also a bright young student there
named Fred Kaltenborn. Kaltenborn
was a' very lively, quick fellow, ac-
cording to Dr. Hicks, and was an
expert debater and a very active
member of the debate team. He
seemed to be well liked by his fel-
low-students except for a certain

air of arrogance about him which ‘
made close friendships difficult.

Dr. Hicks knew Kaltenborn quite
well. They Were graduated together
and both served as officers in the
U. S. Army during the first World
War. Kaltenborn then taught for
a while in Iowa.

In the early 1930’s Mr. Kaltenborn
went to Germany for a summer trip.
It was then that he became ac-
quainted with the Nazi party, their
ideas and their plans for conquest.
While in Germany he met a young
German girl. a member of the Hitler
Youth movement, whom he married.
Perhaps it was his marriage to this
girl, perhaps it was his German an—
cestry, or perhaps it was just that
the Nazi system appealed to his sense
of arrogance. but whatever the rea-
son was he stayed in Germany and
became a German citizen.

When the war broke out Kalten-
born began a. series of broadcasts
from Germany attempting to spread
German propaganda. He used much
the same method as the famous
"Lord Haw Haw", calling individual
people by name and praising the
military strength of Germany.

American soldiers have attempted
to locate this famous propagandist,
but according to the last reports
they have as yet ben unable to do so.
His wife has been questioned but de-
clares that she does not know where
her husband is. It is certain that
when he is found he will face trial
and probably death as a result of
his part in the war. '

However, it must be remembered
that the case of Fred Kaltenborn is
an exception and by no means a.
usual occurrence The vast majority
of American citizens of German an-
cestry remained loyal to the United
States during the war. Fred Kalten-
born was just one of the few people
who found that they fit better into
life in the homeland of their fore-
fathers.
