And what super things the fresh
have planned for the Sophs tomor-
row and vice verse! We expect
Dorothy of the frosh squad to come
looking rather gray because she
didn't realize that the Sophs were
going to dress for the occasion. But
she will undobutedly overcome her
shyness and really enter into the
spirit of things when she notices the
happy expressions on the faces of
the rest of her class—who expect to
win the cup.

These events mean a lot in count-
ing towards rivalry points and so as
many as possible from both classes
should turn out to help their class
get those points. Each of the lead-
ers of the sports events is more than
able to lead her group in game par-
ticipation.

About Tourneys

MAA is stepping right along in
their playoffs in the ping-pong tour-
ney—-must be their really interested
in finding out who the champ is
from the rest of the names on that
list. As we recall. MAA finished
their ping-pong tourney last year
too. and that last game was certain-
ly worth waiting for. We hope the
last playff this year is as good—and
it probably will be!

P.S.—The WAA tennis tourney is
still being played as far as we know.
And then too . .

We were walking along the hall
the other day with a dear friend
when all of a sudden some water
spurted out of her left eye. Not
wishing to seem to impertinent. we
let the matter ride. A few seconds
later the same thing happened. This
time our curiosity got the better of
our good judgment so we politely in-
quired. “Well dear, and what seems
to be the matter with you today?”
To which a very un-courteous reply
was given. To make what could be
a long story short (if we had enough
room. ha ha) this is what the trouble
was. Seems as though the dear girl
was walking through the lower hall of
Draper, sighted the fountain near
the fellows lockers and became thirs-
ty—all in an instant. She went over.
turned the handle and that's where
the trouble started. Seems as though
the “fountain” is incorrectly termed.
It should be called a geyser. The
poor girl unfortunately got in the
way and now has what is known as
H20 spurtitis. All in a days work.
Crushes Crushes

A little out of our line—but note-
worthy. Looks as though one of the
Chemistry 18 profs (or is there only
one) has made quite a hit with sev-
eral of the Sophomore students in
his class. They uncovered a cut that
was printed some time ago in the
NEWS of this prof. and immediately
set it up on one of the files in the
P. 0. Before anyone can pass by the
file he must turn. face the picture
and smile—not leer—smile. It's a
case of doing one thing or another
—-the other thing being crawling on
the floor past the file. Things like
that always helps pass the time of
day.

No More Suggestions

OK. OK. so we won't have a
Joke section—honestly things aren't
so bad that we have to have one—
when ze public doesn't want it.
We have heard more people say,
“No. really. we don’t think we
would like it too-toolsh." Now
when We figure out what tooisn
means. we'll let you know. Anyway
that takes care of the suggested
joke section. Any more suggestions?
Football

The football game last Wednes-
day ended in defeat for the team
that won the week before so now
everybody is happy. That is every-
body ls happy except the Junior-
frosh team and they feel terrible
because one of the Junior players
made two touchdowns. Now why
should the Juniors feel awful? Well
the Junior wasn't playing for the
Juniors. he was playing for the
Soph-Senlor squad. Confusing isn't
it? But that’s the way those guys
are—they’ll always hel out. Nice
workwif you can get i.

’46  . Takes VictorY

To Even Series Score

Superior Pass Attacks
Higlight Football

‘The Soph - Senior aggrega-
tion evened the series by defeating
the ’47-'49 team 19-12, Wednesday
afternoon at 4:30 on Page Field.

The return of “Red” Evans to the
line-up proved to be the deciding
factor of the game. as he ran, passed
and blocked for the winning team..-

Up to the present day, this has
been one of the cleanest, hard-
fought football games with only
three penalties being called.

First Quarter

The Seniors-Sophs won the toss
and elected to kick. Evans kicked
and Dunn received. On the first
play. Bolles intercepted a pass in-
tended for Nichols and was downed
immediately. The ball was now in
the possession of the ’46-’48 team.
Sullivan faded back. threw a pass
to Evans, but the ball feel to the
ground as an incomplete pass. Evans,
on a reverse, ran twenty-five yards
around left end for the first touch-
down of the day. Sullivan completed
a jump pass to Vaughn for the extra
point.

Dunn made a spectacular run back
of Evans kick, carrying from his
lawn goal line to the mid-field
stripe. Griffin made eight yards
around left end and on the next
play Nichols carried for the Fresh-
Junior for a first down.

Nichols threw a pass to Griffin
which fell incomplete. Failing to
gain in the air, the team took to
running plays. Here the opposing
line held and took over the ball on
their own thirty. Evans on the first
play went around right end for five
yards. A pass from Sullivan to
Bolles put the ball in scoring terri-
tory and on a tricky reverse Evans
scored his second touchdown. The
try for the extra point failed. The
score was now 13-0.

As the quarter ended the Fresh-
Junior squad started rolling, making
two successive first downs.

Second Quarter

An intercepted pass by Evans put
a stop to the drive of the ’47-’49
team. Sullivan completed a pass to
Bolles. but on the next pass, Dunn

State To Play
Med, Pharmacy
Football Squads

Sparky Vaughn, acting President
of M.A.A. since Frank Woodworth's
recent resignation. has scheduled two
State encounters next week with
Albany Med. and Albany Pharmacy
Colleges.

Due to the unexpected occurrence
of Woodworth’s resignation, the ex-
act dates of these games are not
certain. It is probable. however.
that State will play Albany Med.
on Wednesday and Albany Phar-
macy on Thursday.

Also. the set lineup for the games
has not yet been determined. The
following, however, are the possibili-
ties for these encounters: Weber,
who starred last year against the
Siena team, will play left end: 'I'hay-
er, will be in center position; Sulli-
van. who played last year on the
State team against both Med and
Siena. will play quarterback:
Vaughn. proving shifty and light in
several of the contests last year,
will probably also star in the line—
up this season. Several other possi-
bilities for line positions are Nichols,
Griffin. Mills. Holllday. Tabner.
Dunn, and Zanchelli. all who have
taken part in the intramural games
this year.

If these games come through for
the start of inter-collegiate football.
it might well be the start of a series
similar to the one held last year.

intercepted. He ran around right
end for a first down and then Wood-
worth passed to Griffin for nine
yards. Here the defense tightened
and took over the ball. A reverse
from Sullivan to Bolles netted ten
yards, and on the succeeding play
Dunn intercepted and ran in back
ten yards. In the closing minutes
of the first half the ’47-'49ers filled
the air with passes in order to bring
about a score. But this was to no
avail as the half ended 13-0 in favor
of the Senior-Soph group.

Third Quarter:

The second half opened with
Woodworth kicking to Vaughn who
returned the ball to the thirty-five
yard line. Here, a series of passes
with Sullivan doing the pitching
were batted down. From this point
the Junior-Fresh team took over
and made the first first down of
the second half, on a pass from
Nichols to Weber. After completing
this pass, Nichols failed to connect
on the next four attempts and the
Senior-Sophs took over. On the
next play a long, high sailing pass
thrown by Evans nestled into the
outstretched hands of Bolles who
scored the final '46-’48 touchdown.
This play carried sixty-five yards.

After receiving the kick-off, the
’47-'49 squad marched to a touch-
down in three successive plays.
Woodworth passed to Dunn for a
first down and then carried for six
yards putting the ball on the op-
ponents 40 yard line. Then a long
pass from Nichols to Weber re-
sulted in pay dirt. The extra point
failed. The score now, 19-6, Wood-
w0rth kicked off to Sullivan as
the q uarter ended.

Fourth Quarter:

The ball see-sawed back and
forth from one end of the field to
the other. Both teams tightened
their pass defense and it looked as

the game would end without
another score. With the ball in the
possession of the '47-'49 team. Dunn
faded back to throw a pass, and
seeing the defense spread apart,
streaked down the middle of the
field for a touchdown. The at-
tempted run for the extra point
failed. The game ended with the
score 19-12.

'MAA Speeds
Ping Pong Sets;
Posts Winners

MAA swings into the lead this
week with the ping-pong tourney
as eight games have been com-
pleted in the first round. Judging
from the speed with which they
have played these games, the final
championship game should be
played within the next two weeks.

The regular games are played 2
out of 3, the semi-finals 3 out of
5 and the finals 4 out of 'l.

Miner Wins

Considering the games which
have been played so far. the Miner-
Woodworth game has been the
most exciting. Each of the players
won one of the games and so the
third game had to be played. In
this game Miner succeeded in beat-
ing Woodworth in a fast 21-14 third
game.

The results of all of the games
are not available as they were not
recorded on the sheet. The fol-
lowing, however are the winners of
the matches that have been played:

Sullivan beat Mills, Dickinson
lost to Lashinsky, Wagner tri-
umphed over Dunn, Feldman was
defeated by Crandall, Weinberg
and Minor won their matches from
Palevsky and Woodworth, respec-
tively, Weiner beat Herold and
Weber defeated MacCarthy.

The winner of the match between
Wagner and Lashinsky will prob-
ably play Kaufman in the semi-
f.nals. Kaufman is the defending
champ this year having beaten
Zippin in the final game of the
season last year.

Kaufman Favored

Kaufman is the favored player in
both of the matches and will play
with Kaiser and Sullivan. Neither
of these games, however, have yet
been played.

Judging from last year’s results,
Zippin, Weiner and Maliery all
have chances of showing up in the
semi-finals. The match between
Zippin and Maliery has not yet
been played. Both of these players
are more than proficient and the
game should be a good one. Unless
Maliery has some unexpected plays
he intends to use, Zippin will prob-
ably win this match.

Athletics Start
interclass Rivalry

On Campus Day

Dashes, Races Spotlight
Morning's Activities

The rivalry sports events will get
underway tomorrow morning as the
Sophs try for their first rivalry
points against a determined frosh
squad.

The two teams will participate in
a number of races and dashes.
These will include a three-legged
race, an old clothe race, wheel-
barrow and sack races and a
straight dash. There will be, as far
as it is now known, no relays.
Practices Held

The frosh have held two prac-
tices so far and another is sched-
uled for this afternoon. Mickey

Seamen, ’49 who is in charge of

these events for the frosh class,

says that the final teams will be

picked today and that those not
coming to this final practice will
be eliminated.

The frosh are counting on speed
in these races and the frosh who
have come out for practice have
showed, according to their captain,
“lots of enthusiasm and willingness
to really get in there and work."
Frosh Possibilities

Some of the fresh who look like
possibilities for these races are
Anderson, Pless and Hawkins along
with Fitzgibbons and Rodak who
because of their speed, will prob-
ably run in the three-legged race.
Califano and Owens are also pos-
sibilities for either the straight
dash or the sack race.

Says Captain Seamen, “it's won-
derful working with kids who show
so much enthusiasm and who are
willing to plug all the way to see
the fresh come out on top. With
kids like these. we can’t help but
win!"

Sophs Confident

The Sophs are also confident
that they will be the winner of the
cup to be awarded to the winner
of the most rivalry points tomor-
row. Pat Tilden, '48, captain of
the Sophs, has also received co-
operation from the athletic minded
women in her class. Among those
participating for the Sophs will be
Fischer. Osborne, Tichy and Young.

Tilden also had a statement to
make, “All I have to say is that
maybe the frosh have spirit, but
we’ve got the skill. Victory is ours!"

 

Volleyball Practice

Volley 'co-captains Ellen Roch-
ford and Jean Connors announce
that approximately forty girls have
signed up to play and have turned
out for practices. Due to the fact
that the gym is being used on
Tuesdays and Thursdays by MAA,
volley ball cannot take place in
case of rain. Otherwise. it will be
held on the dorm field, as usual.
Because of these inconveniences.
being present at least two thirds
of the required time will suffice,
if it occurs that an insufficient
number of practices are held to
gain the usual ten hours credit,
according to Rochford.
