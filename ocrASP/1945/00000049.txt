At this writing, tears are slipping
out of the corner of our eyes. The
war '.5 supposed to be over and yet
what happens—the “boys”,are still
leaving much to the consternation
of MAA. The one we are thinking
of in particular is the well known
“Sparky” Vaughn otherwise known
as the “queen” of the Sophomores’
Campus Day skit. He expects to
leave for the Army Tuesday. Well
we hate to mention names—but
certain people are really going to
met. that boy.

We also hear that Bob Dickinson
is planning on coming back next
semester to take up where he left
off last year. More added news
that counts towards the final
thought that we may have a won-
derful basketball team for second
semester.

Rivalry Remarks

It seems appropriate to mention
here what rivalry is supposed to be
——since it was in connection with
the rivalry sports events that so
much furor arose. Last week on
Saturday morning, several sports
events were held to determine the
winner of four rivalry points. The
fresh won two of these without
question, the Sophs won one and
there seems to have been a question
as to which team was entitled to
the other point. The trouble arose
over the fact that one of the teams
claimed not to have received the
complete instructions for the old
clothes race. A trial was held to
try and determine who should re-
ceive the point or whether the race
should be disqualified. It was de-
cided that the point should be giv-
en to the frosh because both teams
had received the same rules. This
was, as far as we can see. a per-
fectly fair way of awarding the
point. Yet seine of the members
in the Soph class wore complaining
about the judges, about their presi-
dent "who should have fought for
point” and about everything in
general. It should be emphasized
that rivalry as such should not be
a cut—throat affair. We actually
find some fresh and Sophs refusing
to speak to one another because
they happen to be a member of the
rivalry class. This is too petty to
keep happening all the time. We
would think that a little better
show of sportsmanship is in order
on the part of the classes. The
hockey game is coming soon—~hcrc
would be an opportunity to show it.

The tennis tournament is, we
hear officially over—not that it was
completed of course, because that
would be too revolutiomtry. There
goes that cup again. Seeing the rc-
sults of this tournament or rather
the lack of results makes us won-
dcr whether or not We should mon-
tion the fact that there may be a
volleyball tournament. When. where
and how are interesting questions
aren‘t they?

We were noting that last year at
this time. the fellows had a rivalry
hockey game. If wasn‘t played for
rivalry points but it was it really
good game. Nice to have some-
thing like that this year but there
is an excuse. Aiiyyvuy the gals are
making up for the games the fol-
lows aren’t playing and thcn some
«in hockcy crin'ybody is playing
cyci'ybody cisc. ’i‘hc MllllC-li‘Ohll
game is going to be quite an uilair
and though we don't like to be
pessimistic for the frosh it does look
like Mllnc's game. ’i‘hosc kids have
an exceptionally finc team. The
frosh on the othcr hand have had
little or no experience in the sport
or in working together as u tcnm.

Well. we never know how those
rumors start, but lhc latest is that
Joan Hyllndw—lust year's Sports 112d-
ltor is about to take thc intul stcpw
in other words. we hour from roll-
cblc ‘9 sources that she is going to be
married. If anyone knows any-
thing further about this would they
please let us knoww-btecinso it it
isn't true  can you imagine how
surprised Joiu'iie is going to be when
she reads this? If it is true, well
We want to start taking up a col-
lection right away to buy her a
presentwsomething like a four-year
subscription to the News.

STATE COLLEGE NEWS, FRIDAY, NOVEMBER 2. 1945

Rivalry Hockey Game
To Be Played Thursday

Frosh And, Sophs
Vie For Pomts

Now that the foot races are over
and hockey is coming into the lime-
llght, the byword is “Oh, my aching
shins" as the fl‘OSh and Sophs bat-
tl-e against each other at hockey
practice in preparation for the
coming rivalry game. Thursday,
November 8, at 4 P. M. on Page
Hall field the two teams will meet
and. decide which is the better of
the two—or the luckier.

The freshmen seem to have a
well balanced team even though
they’re playing together for the
first time. Einson and Pless are
leading the frosh in stickwork and
co-ordination, Owens and Josiin
will keep the Sophs stepping with
their steady even playing while
Stittig sparks the backfield with
her fighting spirit. This seems to
be a winning set-up but let’s look
at the Sophomore line-up.

Ctr-operation Shown

Co-operation describes the Soph
team perfectly and Magginess and
Hegginger as inner and wing are
excellent examples of this. As is
expected, according to last year's
line-up, Quinn will play center
fullback and Pascuzzi left wing.
Diffin, center halfback. and Rand
and Tichy. left and right halfs,
will supply the ball to the attacking
forward line and to the wings doin-
onstrating their ability for long
drives. The backbone of the team
Just as she was last year, Diehl, in
top condition from Hockey camp,
is expected to give the frosh good
cause for worry.

Frosh Players

The freshmen this year seem to
have n few brand new players—
menning new to the game of hockey.
Donncily and Marsher are playing
hockey for the first time but seem
to be natural hockey players. Of
course. a lot of credit for their
training should be given to Betty
Ann Margot. ‘47, who is coaching
them.

According to an unbiased opin-
ion ihc Sophs havc a slight edge
over the fresh. The edge seems to
be based on the fact that the Sophs
have played together before but
1th week the frosh will get a good
work out by playing Millie and the
Juniors.

Remember fresh and Sophs.
hockcy isn't the only thing for
which rivalry points are awarded
on ’f‘hursday. If you want your
team to win come out and cheer
them on.

Frosh Lead 3-7
In Sports Evenls

Oh. Campus Day. will that never
be forgotten? it was n sad day for
thc Sophs but oh how the frosh rc-

Milne - Frosh
Hockey Game
To Be Played

Fresh-Junior Game,-
Skidmore Tilt Schedule

“Milne vs. the Frosh” again is
echoed through State College as
the fresh pick up" hockey sticks to
battle Milne's prize team this aft-
ernoon on Page Field at 3:30.

This game is a warm-up session
for the ’49’ers but it will test their
skill and teamwork as Milne has
one of the outstanding field hockey
teams in this section of the state.
Kilby, Milne’s outstanding forward.
will be the person to watch as she
teams up with Fletcher in an at-
tempt to score. Tainter, on the
defensive, will probably break up
any attempt to score on the part
of the frosh.

The frosh, on the other hand,
will have a formidable team. Picss,
center forward, will be flanked by
Owen on the left and Josiin on the
right. Marsher and Ineson will
play the right and left wing posi-
tions respectively. Stittig, Monroe,
and Donnelly will hold down the
positions of half-backs. Avaiear
and Harris. fullbacks, will aid goalie
Anderson in thwarting any attempt
for points on the part of their op—
poncnts.

The fresh squad has been prac-
ticing from sun-up to sun-down
(literally) as the Dorm Field has
been a hive of activity. They have
been up against some stiff competi-
tion, in the form of the upperclass-
men. but have shown a lot of spirit
and pop in their drives.

Al. another practice session the
frosh will tackle their sister class.
‘47. on the Dorm Field, Monday aft-
ernoon at four o‘clock. The Junior
team will be made up mostly of
the squad who defeated ’48 in the
rivalry game last year. They play—
ed rough and tumble hockey in the
lust rivalry game and will probably
field a team that will offer good
opposition lo the ‘40‘crs. The for-
ward line will have Campbell as
ccntcr and Sweeney and Bakcr as
lnncrs. Margot and Van Franklin
will play as half-backs and Wilklll
w,ll stand bcfwccn the goal posts.
iIilf, Mastrangclo. Davidson. and
chorralnc will be illl ziblc bunch
of subsfifuics to field. This should
prove an interesting game as ihc
Juniors have had little practice this
year and the frosh have hard to
make up a team from comparative
strnngcrs.

The women of State will unite
and form ilil All-Slate Hockey team
to play Skidmorc on November 17
on Dorm Field. Miss Foster and a
Skidinorc rcprcscniatlvc will mn—
plrc and rcfcrcc the game.

Quinn. '48. will play ccnlcr for-
ward and chcncy. ‘47. and Camp-

Ping PongNeors
Final Ploy-offs

The MAA ping pong tournament
is steadily swinging into its final
rounds. The competition is keen
and the fellows are showing a lot
of interest and enthusiasm. To
date all the first matches have been
played off and several of the sec-
ond matches are over.

In the rest of the games in the
first games completed this week,
Kaufman beat Kaiser, Mallery lost
to Zippin, and O'Meara defeated
Favreau.

Second Round

Four of the matches have been
played in the second round narrow-
ing the list to some of the most
proficient players in school. Kauf-
man defeated Sullivan in the first
two games played. winning both of
the games by a clear margin. One
of Kaufman’s best assets is his ab-
ility of placing the ball in almost
any position he wants and he usual-
ly succeeds in keeping his opponent
busy returning balls. Wagner
defeated Lashinsky in the second
round. Zippin took Miner in both
games played Wednesday afternoon.
There wasn't much doubt as the
games started as to who the victor
would be—as Zippin gained a sub-
stantial lead in the beginning of
each of the games and kept right
in there to beat Minor 21-13 and
21—8. Weiner topped Weber in two
out of three games. Weber took
the first game 10—21 but Weiner re-
turned to take the next two matches
21-10 and 21—17.

Semi-Finals

Crandeli and Weinberg have yet
to play off their match in the sec-
ond round. This match will com-
plete the round. The winner of
this match will play Zippin in a

  

 

Women Blitz Naval Force ~
Ask WAA Hiking Credit

Several of the more ambitious,
curious and athletic members of
the “weaker” sex, decided to
take a look at the ships at an-
chor in the Port of Albany.
They started out early Saturday
morning—in fact too early so
they waited until the gates open—
‘ed. After reaching the ships,
they kept with their guide to
try and learn something about
the workings of ships, subs,
etc‘. . . . and boy did they learn
about the ships. Did you ever
try wrestling with a gyroscope,
make coffee and climb up and
down the side ladders—No? Well
you haven't lived!

Anyway their problem Doctor
Seymour is—“Can we get WAA
credit for walking?”

 

deciding game in the third round.
The winner of this game will play
Weiner in the semi-finals. The
Kaufman-Wagner match will com—
plete the semi-final stage. Again
Kaufman is favored in this match.

The semi-final will probably be
between Kaufman and Zippin and
the outcome of this game is un-
certain. Both of these players are
steady—relying not on slams but on
even. quick returns.

Entering the semi—finals it is
necessary for the player to win
three out of five games played. In
the finals four out of seven games
must be won.

Side Rental-ks

Words of encouragement are
really not needed here. but some
kind of congratulations are —— for
those boys are showing lots of en-
thusiasm in playing off these games.
Nico spirit.

New Shortage Hils Stole;

Christmas Vacation Rafioned

“Some news is good news!”
Cigarettes have come back, ny-
lons are coming back, and so
are we coming back—early.

Dr. John M. Sayles, President
of the College. announced that
the faculty has voted a change
in the Christmas recess. Col-
lege will close at 5:25 P. M. on
Tuesday, December.18, and will
resume on Thursday, January 3,
at 8:10 A. M.

This change was brought
about by a petition devised by
some members of the student
body. Since many of the stu-
dents work during the pre-
Yule rush. they felt that they
could use the three extra days,
and this, in their opinion, was
enough to warrant a change in
the previous schedule.

So get out your buckets and
weep — here goes your New
Year's celebration. Tough—but
that‘s life.

 

Appoint Harvey
To D&A Council

Mary Harvey, '47, President of
College Playhouse, has been named
a member ex-officio of Dramatics
and Arts Council from the Junior
Class. Marie Liebl. ‘46, President of
D&A. announced that the appoint-
ment was made this week as the
result of an amendment to the
council constitution.

The amendment states that the
head of College Playhouse shall
automatically become a non-voting
member of D & A for his or her
term of office. Miss Liebl explained
that this move will coordinate the
activities of the two dramatic
groups and enable the Playhouse
director to “sit in" on council meet-
ings. Miss Harvey will be presented
a council key in assembly today.

A second constitutional amend-
ment states that any tryout for D
& A must; actively participate in
some phase of dramatics or art
production or be enrolled in a dra-
matic or art course. If a tryout has
.already completed such a course
the requirement will be satisfied.
Those seeking council membership
will still be required to make post-
ers. usher, and do other work in
addition to the new requirements.
This will not affect tryouts from
the Class of '48.

Two plays are scheduled by Col-
lege Playhouse for the near future.
Clyde Cook and Joan Alverson,
Juniors. are co-diroctors of one
drama, while Betty Rose Hilt. ‘47.
is in charge of the second one.

sociation in writing twenty-four
hours before the hunt of the loca-
tion of their respective banner and

and that the books be open to in-
spection.

Freshmen Vote Down Sororities 68 '65 In Poll

To the question “Do you want to
join a sorority?". of; freshmen room—
cn unsiocrcd. yes. (18 answered No,
eight were undecided. and nine left
the query blank. ’l‘his iiuinbor rep-
resents thc opinion of new. of the
class of '40 in the News poll on
sororities taken this week.

For the first time in yours, u
freshman class was presented with
a program designed to help them
understand the workings of the
seven sororities on campus. The
udvunlugcs und dlsrulvuntuges were
outlined in u debate botwuon two

A non-sorority member then spoke,

The main purpose of the new
venture was to offer the class of "iii
a fair view of what sorority life and
independent life have to offer bo-
foro the answer to “Shall I join
a sorority?" must be given. Since
it has often been suld that the

freshmen women know too little
about the situation as it whole be-
fore bids are sent out, Orientation
authorities put their respective
bends together and planned what
they considered the fairest pre-
sentation of filcts -the debate.

Considering that the program it-
self bred much heretofore unheard
discussion on tho sorority ques-
tion, the News felt that a poll on
frosh opinion was in order. Ballots
were distributed (see page 3) and
the frosh thereby given an oppor-
tunity to have their side told.

On the first question. an almost
unanimous opinion was expressed
