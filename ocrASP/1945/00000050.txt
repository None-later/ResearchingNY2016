— By MARY LIZ SULLIVAN --—

At this writing, tears are slipping
out of the corner of our eyes. The
war is supposed to be over and yet
what happens—the “boys” are still
leaving much to the consternation
of MAA. The one we are thinking
of in particular is the well known
“Sparky” Vaughn otherwise known
as the “queen” of the Sophomores’
Campus Day skit. He expects to
leave for the Army Tuesday. Well
we hate to mention names—but
certain people are really going to
m.ss that boy.

We also hear that Bob Dickinson
is planning on coming back next
semester to take up where he left
off last year. More added news
that counts towards the final
thought that we may have a won-
derful basketball team for second
semester.

Rivalry Remarks

It seems appropriate to mention
here what rivalry is supposed to be
—since it was in connection with
the rivalry sports events that so
much furor arose. Last week on
Saturday morning, several sports
events were held to determine the
winner of four rivalry points. The
fresh won two of these without
question, the Sophs won one and
there seems to have been a question
as to which team was entitled to
the other point. The trouble arose
over the fact that one of the teams
claimed not to have received the
complete instructions for the old
clothes race. A trial was held to
try and determine who should re-
ceive the point or whether the race
should be disqualified. It was de-
cided that the point should be giv-
en to the fresh because both teams
had received the same rules. This
was, as far as we can see, a per-
fectly fair way of awarding the
point. Yet some of the members
in the Soph class were complaining
about the judges, about their presi-
dent “who should have fought for
point” and about everything in
general. It should be emphasized
that rivalry as such should not be
a. cut-throat affair. We actually
find some fresh and Sophs refusing
to speak to one another because
they happen to be a member of the
rivalry class. This is too petty to
keep happening all the time. We
would think that a little better
show of sportsmanship is in order
on the part of the classes. The
hockey game is coming soon—here
would be an opportunity to show it.

The tennis tournament is. we
hear officially over—not that it was
completed of course, because that
would be too revolutionary. There
goes that cup again. Seeing the re-
sults of this tournament or rather
the lack of results makes us won-
der whether or not we should men-
tion the fact that there may be a
volleyball tournament. When, where
and how are interesting questions
aren’t they?

We were noting that last year at
this time. the fellows had a rivalry
hockey game. It wasn‘t played for
rivalry points but it was a really
good game. Nice to have some-
thing like that this year but there
is an excuse. Anyway the gills are
making up for the games the fel-
lows aren't playing and then some
—~—in hockey everybody is playing
everybody else. The Millie-fresh
game is going to be quite an affair
and though we don‘t like to be
pessimistic for the fresh it does look
like Millie's game. Those kids have
an exceptionally line team. The
fresh on the other hand have had
little or no experience in the sport
or in working together as a team.

Well. we never know how these
rumors start. but the latest is that
Joan Hyllnd—last year's Sports Ed-
itor is about to take the fatal step—--
in other words, we hear from reli-
able '9 sources that she is going to be
married. If anyone knows any-
thing further about this would they
please let us know—~becnuso if it
isn’t true n- can you imagine how
surprised Joanie is going to be when
she reads this? If it is true, well
we want to start taking up a col«
lection right away to buy her a
present—something like a four-year
subscription to the News.

STATE COLLEGE NEWS, FRIDAY. NOVEMBER 2, 1945

Rivalry Hockey Game
To Be Played Thursday

Frosh And Sophs
Vie For Paints

Now that the foot races are over
and hockey is coming into the lime-
light, the byword ls “Oh, my aching
shins" as the fresh and Sophs bat-
tl-e against each other at hockey
practice in preparation for the
coming rivalry game. Thursday,
November 8, at 4 P. M. on Page
Hall field the two teams will meet
and. decide which is the better of
the two—or the luckier.

The freshmen seem to have a
well balanced team even though
they’re playing together for the
first time. Einson and Pless are
leading the fresh in stickwork and
co-ordination. Owens and Joslin
will keep the Sophs stepping with
their steady even playing while
Stittig sparks the backfield with
her fighting spirit. This seems to
be a winning set-up but let’s look
at the Sophomore line-up.

Co—operation Shown

Co-operation describes the Soph
team perfectly and Magglness and
Hegginger as inner and wing are
excellent examples of this. As is
expected, according to last year’s
line-up, Quinn will play center
fullback and Pascuzzi left wing.
Diffin, center halfback, and Rand
and Tichy, left and right halfs,
will supply the ball to the attacking
forward line and to the wings clem-
onstrating their ability for long
drives. The backbone of the team
just as she was last year, Diehl, in
top condition from Hockey camp,
is expected to give the fresh good
cause for worry.

Fresh Players

The freshmen this year seem to
have a few brand new players—-
meaning new to the game of hockey.
Donnelly and Marsher are playing
hockey for the first time but seem
to be natural hockey players. Of
course. a lot of credit for their
training should be given to Betty
Ann Margot. ‘47. who is coaching
them.

According to an unbiased opin-
ion the Sophs have a slight edge
over the fresh. The edge seems to
be based on the fact that the Sophs
have played together before but
tth week the fresh will get a good
work out by playing Milne and the
Juniors.

Remember fresh and Sophs.
hockey isn't the only thing for
which rivalry points are awarded
on Thursday. If you want your
team to win come out and cheer
them on.

Fresh Lead 3-l
In Sports Events

Oh. Campus Day, will that never
be forgotten? It was a sad day for
the Sophs but oh how the fresh re-
jo.’ced with the cup taken that
morning.

The Sophs seemed to be jinxed
from the start as Fisher and 'I‘iehy
running the three-legged race,
stumbling about 3 feet from the
starting line, and unable to get up.
allowed the two fresh to come in
without any competition. Williams
and Lavender in the wlicelbarrmv
race \vere leading by 15 feet when
Williams doubled up with a terrific
pain in her side which resulted in
the collapse of the wheelbarrow and
left a clear field for Seninnn and
McIntyre. The clash was the
crowning disappointment to the
Soph ego us ’f‘ichy crossed the llll~
lshing line already broken by Sea-
man. the i'rosh stur. Apparently
the Sophs are used to bags since
that was the only race they won
that day. Heggenger was the out-
standing Juinpcr in this race by
him-casing the Soph lead at least
20 feet. The last race of the day
was the old clothes race in which
Emmerllug started for the fresh
and Young for the Sophs. The fresh
also won the race marking the first
standing of the rivalry score at 3 to
1 in favor of the fresh.

Milne - Frosh
Hockey Game
To Be Played

Frosh-Junior Game,-
Skidmore Tilt Schedule

“Milne vs. the Fresh" again is
echoed through State College as
the fresh pick up‘ hockey sticks to
battle Milne's prize team this aft-
ernoon on Page Field at 3:30.

This game is a warm-up session
for the ’49’ers but it will test their
skill and teamwork as Milne has
one of the outstanding field hockey
teams in this section of the state.
Kilby, Milne’s outstanding forward,
will be the person to watch as she
teams up with Fletcher in an at-
tempt to score. Tainter, on the
defensive, will probably break up
any attempt to score on the part
of the fresh. ,

The fresh, on the other hand,
will have a formidable team. Pless,
center forward. will be flanked by
Owen on the left and Joslin on the
right. Marsher and Ineson will
play the right and left wing posi-
tions respectively. Stittig, Monroe,
and Donnelly will hold down the
positions of half-backs. Avalear
and Harris. fullbacks, will aid goalie
Anderson in thwarting any attempt
for points on the part of their op-
ponents.

The fresh squad has been prac-
ticing from sun-up to sun-down
(literally) as the Dorm Field has
been a hive of activity. They have
been up against some stiff competi-
tion. in the form of the upperclass—
men, but have shown a lot of spirit
and pep in their drives.

At another practice session the
fresh will tackle their sister class,
'47. on the Dorm Field. Monday aft-
ernoon at four o‘clock. The Junior
team will be made up mostly of
the squad who defeated ’48 in the
rivalry game last year. They play-
ed rough and tumble hockey in the
last rivalry game and will probably
field a team that will offer good
opposition to the ‘49‘crs. The for-
ward line will have Campbell as
center and Sweeney and Baker as
lnners. Margot and Van Franklin
will play as half-backs and Wakin
\v.ll stand between the goal posts.
Hilt. Mastrangelo. Davidson, and
deflorraine will be an able bunch
of substitutes to field. This should
prove an interesting game as the
Juniors have had little practice this
year and the frosh have had to
make up a team from comparative
strangers.

The women of State will unite
and form an All-State Hockey team
to play Skidmore on November 17
on Dorm Field. Miss Foster and a
Skidmore representative will um—
pire and referee the game.

Quinn, ’48. will play center for-
ward nnd Sweeney, ‘47. and Camp-
bell. '47. or Owens, ’49. will flunk
her sides. Heginger, ‘48. right
wing. and Ineson. '49, left wing will
complete the forward line. Diifln.
'48. or Margot, ’47. will play center
half and ’l‘ichy, ‘48, and Campbell.
'47. will complete the half-back line.
Rand and Diehl. Sophomores. will
fill the fullback positions. aiding
Boynton. '48. in her gonl guarding

This All-Stnr squad is the best
that has been i'ii-lded by Slate in
many ll your. Skidmore, on the
other hand. hus had excellent
hockey teams for the lust few years
and this game promises to be one
of the best (contests that State has
ever seen.

Ping PongNeors
Final Play-offs

The MAA ping pong tournament
is steadily swinging into its final
rounds. The competition is keen
and the fellows are showing a lot
of interest and enthusiasm. To
date all the first matches have been
played off and several of the sec-
ond matches are over.

In the rest of the games in the
first games completed this week,
Kaufman beat Kaiser, Mallery lest
to Zippin, and O'Meara defeated
Favreau.

Second Round

Four of the matches have been
played in the second round narrow-
ing the list to some of the most
proficient players in school. Kauf-
man defeated Sullivan in the first
two games played, winning both of
the games by a clear margin. one
of Kaufman’s best assets is his ab-
ility of placing the ball in almost
any position he wants and he usual-
ly succeeds in keeping his opponent
busy returning balls. Wagner
defeated Lashinsky in the second
round. Zippin took Miner in both
games played Wednesday afternoon.
There wasn’t much doubt as the
games started as to who the victor
would be——as Zippin gained a sub-
stantial lead in the beginning of
each of the games and kept right
in there to beat Minor 21-13 and
21-8. Weiner topped Weber in two
out of three games. Weber took
the first game 10-21 but Weiner re-
turned to take the next two matches
21—10 and 21—17.

Semi-Finals

Crandell and Weinberg have yet
to play off their match in the sec-
ond round. This match will com-
plete the round. The winner of
this match will play Zippin in a

 

Women BIilzNavol Force v‘
Ask WAA Hiking Credit

Several of the more ambitious,
curious and athletic members of
the "weaker" sex, decided to
take a look at the ships at an-
chor in the Port of Albany.
They started out early Saturday
morning—in fact too early so
they waited until the gates open-
ed. After reaching the ships,
they kept with their guide to
try and learn something about
the workings of ships, subs,
etc. . . . and boy did they learn
about the ships. Did you ever
try wrestling with a gyroscope,
make coffee and climb up and
down the side ladders——No? Well
you haven't lived!

Anyway their problem Doctor
Seymour is—"Can we get WAA
credit for walking?”

 

deciding game in the third round.
The winner of this game will play
Weiner in the semi-finals. The
Kaufman-Wagner match will com-
plete the semi-final stage. Again
Kaufman is favored in this match.

The semi-final will probably be
between Kaufman and Zippin and
the outcome of this game is un-
certain. Both of these players are
steady—relying not on slams but on
even, quick returns.

Entering the semi-finals it is
necessary for the player to win
three out of five games played. In
the finals four out of seven games
must be won.

Side Remarks

Worcis of encouragement are
really not needed here, but some
kind of congratulations are — for
those boys are showing lots of en-
thusiasm in playing off these games.
Nice spirit.

New Shortage Hils Slate,-
Chrisimos Vacation Rafioned

“Some news is good news!”
Cigarettes have come back, ny-
lens are coming back, and so
are we coming back—early.

Dr. John M. Sayles. President
of the College, announced that
the faculty has voted a change
in the Christmas recess. Col-
lege will close at 5:25 P. M. on
Tuesday, December.18, and will
resume on Thursday, January 3,
at 8:10 A. M.

This change was brought
about by a petition devised by
some members of the student
body. Since many of the stu-
dents work durlng the pre-
Yuie rush, they felt that they
could use the three extra days,
and this, in their opinion, was
enough to warrant a changein
the previous schedule.

So get out your buckets and
weep — here goes your New
Year's celebration. Tough—but
that's life.

 

Appoint Harvey
To D&A Council

Mary Harvey, ’47, President of
College Playhouse, has been named
a member ex—offieio of Dramatics
and Arts Council from the Junior
Class. Marie Liebl, '46, President of
D&A, announced that the appoint-
ment was made this week as the
result of an amendment to the
council constitution.

The amendment states that the
head of College Playhouse shall
automatically become a non-voting
member of D & A for his or her
term of office. Miss Liebl explained
that this move will coordinate the
activities of the two dramatic
groups and enable the Playhouse
director to “sit in” on council meet-
ings. Miss Harvey will be presented
a council key in assembly today.

A second constitutional amend-
ment states that any tryout for D
& A must actively participate in
some phase of dramaties or art
production or be enrolled in a dra-
matic or art course. If a tryout has
.already completed such a course
the requirement will be satisfied.
Those seeking council membership
will still be required to make post-
ers, usher, and do other work in
addition to the new requirements.
This will not affect tryouts from
the Class of ’48.

Two plays are scheduled by Col-
lege Playhouse for the near future.
Clyde Cook and Joan Alverson,
,Juniors, are co—directors of one
drama, while Betty Rose Hilt, '47,
is in charge of the second one.

Student Council has appointed
Philip Lashinsky, ’47, Chairman of
the troupe show. with Lorna Kunz
and Muriel Rubin, Juniors, and
Eloise Worth, ’48, as committee

The rivalry committee of Student
Council has made a number of
changes in the banner rules.
Banner Rules

The banners of both classes must
be hidden twenty-four hours before
the hunt, and both classes must
notify the president of Student As-
sociation in writing twenty-four
hours before the hunt of the loca-
tion of their respective banner and
when it was placed there.

No banners of previous classes or
other organizations shall be taken
from their locations during the
hunt.

The Lounge. ventillating system,
projection room. and lavatories
have been added to the places ban-
ned as hiding places for the ban-
ner.

Student Council must inform
both classes of all banner rules be-
fore the hunt.

The revisions will be posted on
the bulletin board in Huested.

Student Council has made the
recommendation that all classes
have their class treasurer make a
report on the financial condition of
the class two weeks before elections,
and that the books be open to in-
spectlon.

 

Freshmen Vote Down Sororities 68 ‘65 In Poll

To the question “Do you want to
join a sorority '2”, (l5 freshmen went--
on answered yes, 68 anorecrcd no,
eight were undecided, and nine left
the query blank. This number rep-
resents the opinion of 029-27.. of the
class of '49 in the News poll on
sororities taken this week.

For the first time in years, a
freshman class was presented with
a program designed to help them
understand the workings of the
seven sororities on campus. The
advantages and disadvantages were
outlined in a debate between two
pro-sorority and two con-sorority
girls lust Monday in Orientation.
A non-sorority member then spoke,
giving a picture of independent
life ut State. On the affirmative
were Gloria Gilbert, '48, and Gloria
McFerrun, '46; on the negative were
Evelyn Dorr, ’47, and Georgette
Dunn, ’4“. The indopendents‘were
represented by Kay Hagerty. '47.

The main purpose of the new
venture was to offer the class of '49
a fair view of what sorority life and
independent life have to offer be-
fore the answer to “Shall I join
a sorority?" must be given. Since
it has often been said that the

freshmen women know too little
about the situation as a whole be-
fore bids are sent out, Orientation
authorities put their respective
heads together and planned what
they considered the fairest pre-
sentation of facts~the debate.

Considering that the program it-
self bred much heretofore unheard
discussion on the sorority ques-
tion, the Nsws felt that a poll on
fresh opinion was in order. Ballots
were distributed (see page 3) and
the fresh thereby given an oppor-
tunity to have their side told.

On the first question, an almost
unanimous opinion was expressed
mute ’Jlil’crs did feel that the pro-
gram helped them to understand
the sorority question here at State.
Which is, in itself, a gratifying
boon to the morale of those who
took part in and those who spon-
sored the debate. It would seem
that this sort of thing, or a similar
program, is gratefully received by
a newly enrolled student and
should be continued.

In answer to the second query,
few of the fresh. considered that
the fer speakers were prejudiced.
An orchid to these gals who tried

and succeeded in being objective
about the matter. despite any per-
sonal feelings they may have had.

Tabulation of the third question
showed a paradox. On the first
part, although the majority said
that the program did not influence
them either for or against joining
up with the Greeks, a contradim
tion was seen in Hie very much
larger number who reported that
the program influenced them a-
gainst accepting a bid, on the
second part of this question. A
logical explanation of this ambig-
uity might very well be that a
great many of the fresh left either
or both parts of the answers to the
query blank.

The two parts of the fourth-—
the main reason for wanting or
not wanting to join a sorority-«—
showed interesting results. The af-
firmative nmjoriiy expressed a de—
sire for more social life, “getting
to know the girls really well" and
forming closer friendships. Other
reasons given were that sororities
“are an advantage to the commu-
ter," “enable you to meet more
men" (l) and “help you to get to

tively new organization, all the work
done with this group will be recrea-
tional. Joseph Palevsky. '46, is or-
ganizing a Youth Forum at the
Booker T. Washington Center.

Students who volunteer to work
at the Albany Home for Children
will have the opportunity to direct
a nursery group or an older group.

There will be a meeting of the

Faculty Big-8 Cancelled;
Next Event In December

Ruth Bentley, '47, Student Director
of the Big-8 Series. has announced
that the proceeds obtained from the
Senior class program totaled 3117.
Miss Bentley also stated that the
Faculty Big-8 program previously
scheduled for November 17 has been
cancelled.

Expenses and a federal tax must
be deducted from the sum obtained
from the Senior Big-(i, making the
net proceeds considerably less than
$117.

The cancellation of the Faculty
program resulted from the difficul-
ties cncountered by the faculty in
scheduling rehearsals for time when
all could be present. This leaves only
six Big-Eight programs scheduled
for the remainder of the year.
