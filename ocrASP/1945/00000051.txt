PITY THE POOR NAVY

Maybe the American civilians had a good time
exploring the ships anchored in New York harbor.
Maybe they enjoyed imitating a sardine’s compressed
existance. But pity the poor sailors aboard ship! Once
they were out to sea fighting a nice peaceful war.
Now they're mobbed by aggressive civilians who “wan-
na see de ship." As one fagged out officer of the U.S.S.
Missouri stated after a hectic day of showing civil-
ians around, “I am sick of people.” (He wants to go
back out to sea . . .)
IS THIS PATENT NECESSARY

Betcha didn’t know that Hedy Lamarr just patented
a radio-steering device for aiming torpedoes
Now, why can't she let some nice homely teacher get
credit for patents? (Does Hedy Lamarr need inven-
tions yet?)
PEOPLE ARE FUNNY

A little while ago, we read that the American GI’s
stationed in Germany were tending to be “taken in"
by a feeling of pity for German civilians, and at the
same time, they developed a negative attitude tow-
ards the Russians stationed there. This atmosphere
does not develop merely because of a whim on the
part of our GI’s. Saul Padover has written a series
of articles for “Nation” showing how our Military
government officials made wholesale use of Nazis in
the early stages of occupation, partly because of their
fear of bolshevism. They shied away from anti-fascists
on the grounds that they might be Reds. samuel
Grafton, columnist on the New York Post, makes a
good Point when he says these same Military govern-
ment officials are not always so ready to shy away
from anti-Russians on the grounds that they might
be fascists . . .
MARRIAGE BUREAU

Latest ex-Stater to join the matrimonial institu-
tion is Nora Giavelli, who is now sporting the surname
Mrs. Elze . . . now, let that be an inspiration to the
rest of you—one day we will all be married (so some
of us have to wait a little longer; is that anything
to get excited about?)

Will Inter-Group Council be of any value to State:
can it effect changes in racial prejudices present in
the college? Can any of its activities bring about
more changes than our inherent spirit of democracy
has already done; is this another expression of this
spirit? Can State‘s inter-group efforts diffuse through-
out our state or country, which shows obvious inher-
ited prejudices of longstanding? Has Inter-Group
council proven its right to be a school organization?

These questions have been floating around the
campus since 100 was established last year and,
more intensely, since the first week of the new se-
mester. We’ve been waiting to give the newest or-
ganization on campus an opportunity to demonstrate
its purposes. The past weekend has at least in part
given the answers.

Hearing the convention speakers, especially Dr.
Davis, and Mrs. Roosevelt, we have come to change
our definitions of inter-group prejudice, tolerance.
inter-race and inter-religious relations. As a result of
the past weekend of discussion with students and
leaders from other colleges we can now give the words
a practicable meaning. It took the weekend speeches
and discussion to consolidate the ways and means of
achieving the aims of an Inter-group council by com-
parison with the progress made by other schools and
colleges in furthering inter-group harmony.

There is no doubt but that the members of Inter-
Group Council have done their best to provide the
school with varied programs featuring speakers on
all aspects of race and religious problems as they are
now in operation throughout different parts of the
state and country. In the weekend program we found
the dominant theme to be the attempt to get all peo-
ple to recognize and respect the differences in race
and religion among all people and to allow the right
and room to express those differences.

The questions asked in the first paragraph cannot
all be answered at this time. Benefits to State's own
inter-group relations and the effects on N. Y. State
communities and other places where we may teach
are yet to be proven. Effects from work done by
State's Inter-Group Council may not at once make
themselves evident Changing or improving race rela~
tions will be the result of long and constant work, by
all groups who can be interested in the change.

A Very real 'csult of an inter—group council is the
engendering of interest and the promotion of inter-
group activity in a college. By the cstabiisinncnt of
Inter-Group Council on campus, State was acknowi~
edged as one of the leaders In N. Y. State and was
made a part of the Nine College Experiment in inter-
group relations. Inter-Group Council has provided
speakers of various races and crccds and It has made
possible a conference with students and prominent
leaders interested in group relations. if inter-group
relations are to be improved, it will be because of
activities like these.

 

STATE COLLEGE NEWS, FRIDAY. NOVEMBER 9, 1945

THE CRITIC 

By MARGE CRONIN

 

This year’s dramatic season was launched Wednesday

night by the presentation of

two one-act plays under the

direction of Lois Fillman and Julia Boxer. The beginning
was laudable and sets a respectable standard for future

thespian endeavors.

First our hat’s off to Harvey and her crew, that group of“
backstage beavers who never get any mention unless he

sets and lights are all wrong.

Well, Wednesday night they

were all “right.” The overstuffed chair on stage, right in
the first play, could have been covered a little more neatly
but the general effect was pleasing. Sets added much to

the background of both plays.

To the Editor:

Last Monday freshmen were or-
iented into State College sororities
with a rough jolt. Several State
women, supposedly representative of

 

- pro-sorority, con-sorority, and pro-

independent factions. gave vent to
their personal opinions for fresh
absorption. The whole affair was a
ludicrous, unjust attempt by the
authorities in charge to do away
with sororities in general. Whose
sororities in general? whose sorori-
ties are these—the women’s in State
or the administration’s? We pride
ourselves on our student government
and student participation as a whole
—a logical conclusion would seem
that when we decided we no longer
want sororities, we will take matters
into our own hands.

Sororities were first established at
State for the purpose of housing—
i. e.. pre-dorm. Now, as then, sor-
ority women live together in closer
and more compatible friendship
than is possible in larger units where
all personalities are thrown together
with no regard to future pleasant
associations and relationships. And
what is college for if not to meet
new personalities and form desir-
able and durable friendships.

You say that is possible without
sororities? True, but then you run
immediately into the problem of
cheques—circles smaller and tighter,
the very properties of which limit
the contacts and broader acquaint-
ances you gain through sororities.
To put it specifically, you know per~
sonally and in varying degrees of
intimacy sixty or more people, which
is quite an impressive number when
you stop to think about it, plus the
new twenty or more bidding sorority
each year. Friendly competition and
mutual admiration between sorori-
ties add countless more to the list.
That's a pile of friends for any one
woman.

Requirements for sorority? Noth-
ing that's inborn or exclusive—a
friendly likable personality. and
what more do you ask of any indi-
vidual for any other purpose you
can name? Sorority pin? A symbol
of an organization comparable to a
firm’s letterhead or a family's mon-
ogrammed silver. Obligations? Vol-
untary, at any time they can be re-
signed. Monetarily insignificant be-
cause State sororities are local, not
national. Participation in school ac-
tivities? Sorority women feel closer
to State through their wide knowl-
edge of the student body and their
subsequent live interest in what goes
on here. Without trying hard you
will find that the number of sorority
women leading and working In State
activities outdlstances by for any
other group. Denominational pref-
erences? Thl'owbacks from earlier
years designed originally to narrow
down rushing because State is such
a large school. As far as i can see,
this is the only objectionable part of
them. and this can be done away
with at any time through mass agi—
tation of sorority womcn. Involved
there, however, are the deep, age-old
religious differences imtwocn Catho-
licism, Protestantism, and Judaism
about which (every Individual is con—
cerncd. It will have to be accepted
as It is until more tolerant und less
secular-milnlcd individuals come to
the fore.

There you have the situation as it
standswsororitit-s, open, comrndcly
groups of State womcn, loosely or-
ganized us social functions serving
to add to college life the particular
flavor and zip the American way of
life boasts.

(inc-who-is-proud-io-lie-sorority

The first play of the evening, a
farce “Surpressed Desires,” received
its share of laughs. Beverly Cop-
lon, as the apostle of psychoanaly-
sis. was definitely the bright light
of the cast. Her character was con-
vincing and consistent, and for the
most part she was at ease on the
stage. Glad to notice she used her
body to help ekpress emotion as so
few beginners do. Bill Blasberg, as
the loving but exaspcz'c ted husband,
was pleasant, composed, and de~
livered his clever lines very well.
However, his character lacked the
maturity that I thought the part
called for. This lack was evident
in the repeated poor gesture of
clasping his hands in front of him;
and in the unconvincing manner in
which he made love to his wife. Bill
should also remember to use more
volume when speaking upstage in
order to be heard. The cast was
completed by Dottie Swegar as the
gullible “country cousin.” Her ges-
tures and movements were awk-
ward. Perhaps my whole impression
was colored by the fact that I
couldn’t hear many of her lines.
The character of Mabel, however,
was consistent throughout.

As the houselights dimed for the
second time there was no mistak-
ing the mood that the fantasy
“Will 0’ the Wisp” meant to create.
That eerie music captivated the
audience and they weren’t released
until the curtain closed. I wonder
if We couldn’t have used more of it
as background for the final scene
at the window? Micky Navey, as
the old country woman, was a pleas-
ant surprise to us all. Her charac-
ter was so convincing that I forgot
it was Micky until her accent slip-
ped. Too bad you had to wait till
your Senior year to be discovered,
Mickey. Mary Card, as the Weird
sp.rit-like creature, did a very dif-
ficult job well. Although she was
graceful in the dance I think she
could have been more forceful;
could have made her gestures more
meaningful. That red hair was
terrific.

Gloria Jaffer, as the sophisticated
poet's wife, turned in a commend-
able performance. Her stage pres-
ence is something to be envied. In
her big scene with the “Will 0’ the
Wisp" she could have built up too
better climax. We’re expecting big-
ger and better performances from
Jaffer. Virginia Day, as Nora the
maid, just couldn't have looked
cuter. Her performance in the first
part was much more praiseworthy
than that in the last. It is diffi-
cult to reach a point of hysteria—
that is probably why she dropped
her accent too.

Directors, actors, and “Backstage
beavers" are all justified in popping
a few buttons off their vests.
Thanks for a swoll evening, Kids.
Curtain, please.

And Miles To Go . . .

Why is it that the Commuter feels like an out-
cast as far as Student Activities are concerned?
The fault lies in several directions.

The students living on Campus are completely
oblivious to the fact that such a thing as a com-
muter even exists. They are so wrapped up with
themselves that they give no more than a passing
glance in the direction of the Commuter problems.

One of the greatest problems for commuters is
housing. In order to stay over for a late meeting
or any College function, it is necessary for the
commuter to buy her dinner and then fool her
time away until the meeting. Afterwards, she must
wait around on some corner for a late bus or stay
at the Y. This would obviously discourage many
from attending College functions or even supporting
the others that are conducted at a convenient time.
Thus, the commuter feels completely left out of
college affairs. Some have been asked: “What is
Residence Council?” They’d never know it existed
and don’t know its purpose.

For the benefit of these people, we would like
to explain Residence Council and Housing Com-
mittee. The Housing Committee was established
to provide housing for State College Students. Does
that include Commuters? Residence Council form—
ulates and enforces the rules of College residence
halls. Is it possible for Residence Council or
Housing Committee or both to provide housing
for commuters who would like to participate in
college activities? If the situation has already been
investigated, we stand corrected. However, we
don’t believe it has.

The greatest fault for the outcast feeling of com-
muters lies with the commuters themselves. True,
we who live on campus can help, but a general
air of complacency among commuters and a per-
petual state of griping will not help matters any.
They lack leadership. Those commuters who have
the ability to put Commuters Club on its feet so
that State has no alternative but to take notice
aren’t interested. They regard the obstacles as in-
surpassable without the least effort to surmount
them.

Commuters Club cannot hope to maintain a
recognized status on campus if they themselves
are disunited. One good leader, and there are sev-
eral, among the commuters can boost the Club.
That leader could see about housing and if she
keeps after it, she will probably succeed. Why
doesn't Commuters Club sponsor activities that
will include all of the Student Body instead of just
the Commuters? That in itself would arouse inter-
est. The Commuters would then be exposed to
what goes on and who‘s behind it as well as to
some worthwhile suggestions from other organiza—
tlons. As it stands now, we hardly know Commu-
ters Club exists and they know very little about
Campus activities.

It is up to the Commuters to take the first step.
If they jtlll us hard enough or keep after us long
enough, we are bound to notice them. They alone
are really aware of the problems that confront
them. lfiheyunake no effort to rectify them, no
:platealfpe (ljlliiii)::iigr)iiltllrliolllel‘. How about it'Com-

.- i, and get on the ball. I‘hat’s
the only way you'll accomplish anything.

Sweater Swooners Form
Sorority To Worship Hero

“Arta Kaupha Beta Than The
Rest" — under this impressive
little title a new “sorority” has
arrived at State.

The activities of this group
of damsels center around pes-
session of two sweaters, and a.
jacket belonging to one Mr.
Kaufman, sole inspiration for
the little congregation. Lucky
is the girl who obtains posses-
sion of the dynamic blue or the
gorgeous yellow sweater and re-
ceives the unsurpassable honor
of parading through the halls
of the college donned in these
sacred garments, singing softly,
tenderly to herself:

“AisfortheAin.....”

Meanwhile her colleagues look
on in envy anticipating the day
when the list will show that
their turn has come to share
this great honor.

Hey, girls, it’s my turn tomor-
row. Isn't that black and white
shirt s-i-m-p-l-y gorgeous? And
it belonged to himl Ahhiil

Student Group

Organizes Club

For Photography

Kasper To Address
Math Club Members

Camera Club, recently formed by
a group of students interested in
learning the fundamentals of pho-
tography, has released tentative
plans for future business and social
activity. Classical Club has sched-
uled a card party Tuesday, and
Math Club will hold its regular
meeting next week.

Camera Club Elects

Paul Meadows, ’48, has been elect-
ed President of the newly organized
group. Other officers are: Vice-
President, Alice Beckers, ’47; and
Secretary-Treasurer, Marion Mi-
eras, ’48. The members met at the
home of Dr. Floyd Henrickson, As-
sistant Professor of Education and
faculty advisor of the group, for
dark room work and instruction in

composition. Lenses and time ex- -t

posures were discussed at another
meeting, and the club considered
joining the Photographic Society of
America.

Meadows has stated that the
members are largely beginners. but
declared that when they have gain-
ed in experience, they will sponsor
an exhibition of their work.

Plan Card Party

Classical Club will hold a card
party on Tuesday from 3 to 5 P. M.
in the Lounge, according to Bar-
bara Chaffee. ‘46, President. There
will be a door prize, games, refresh-
ments. and tables at which card
games will be conducted in French
and Spanish. Admission will be
fifteen cents.

Pauline Myers, '46, President of
Math Club, has announced that the
next meeting will be Tuesday at
7:30 P. M. in Room 101. The meni-
bers will be addressed by Miss Adele
Kasper, ’46, following which plans
will be made for the Christmas
party next month.

Freshmen Vote
Down Sororities

know girls of your own religion.”

A rather startling response was
received from the frosh who ob-
ject to accepting a sorority. The
main objection raised by nearly
all, including many of those who
still intend to join, was on the
basis of the lack of democracy in-
volved. It would seem that the new
Crimson Tide very seriously con-
siders this the most important
question. Such words as "cliquish,"
"snobbish," "unfair selection," and
most of all “undemocratic,” were
used. One frosh made the state-
ment that “such cliquish organiza-
tions have no place in a public in-
stitution.”

Answers to the last question were
the most revolutionary—do you
want to join a sorority? Out of the
62‘/2%, 65 answered yes, 68 no, eight
were undecided and nine left a.
blank. The ballots ran neck and
neck right to the end of the tabula-
tion and the final result seemed to
be a draw, with the “nayes have
