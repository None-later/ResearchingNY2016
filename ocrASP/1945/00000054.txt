— By MARY LIZ SULLIVAN -'—
Yes—and a happy Thanksgiving
to you too! We just know how sad
everyone is at the thought of hav-
ing to go home for a few days’ vaca-
tion but try and bear up under this
trial with the thought that we'll be
back in a matter of a week—or
shouldn’t we have mentioned that?
To bring up a matter that has
already been mentioned on this
page, we would like to say some-
thing about the game betWeen State
and Skidmore. The game is tomor-
row afternoon.
fore, have many State rooters
there. Excluding those who work
on Saturday, there is still left a
substantial number so that if 20%
came to the game tomorrow, we
could have a nice rooting section.
How about it kids are We going to
get out there and give our team
some support? The bets are ten to
one that there will be quite a few
from Skidmore there that won’t be
playing but cheering.
' To keep in line with the cheering
idea, something was definitely lack-
ing with the fresh cheering at the
rivalry hockey game last week. The

1 cheerleaders did their best but

either the frosh weren’t yelling or
else they all weren’t cheering to-
gether. Could even be they didn’t
know the cheers. The Sophs, on
the other hand, had well organized
cheers and most of the Sophs at
the game seemed‘to know them. Of
course the fresh have the excuse
that they weren’t really organized,

but that’s all over now and We‘

should really see some good cheer-
ing at the rivalry games.

“Hockey Cheers '
"‘“Incidentallyg the referee at the
{rivalry game was heard to say that
the frosh 'team showed excellent
form and that the best teams do not
always win hockey games.

We wish people would stop men-
tioning the fact that Army beat
Notre Dame last week. O.K., O.K.,
we listened to that game too—it
must have been Notre Dame’s off
day or something. Boy—and gee,
were we heartbroken—still sniffling.
So, this leaves the Army-Navy
game as the big tiff now. Various
sources say that Army will win and
we are inclined to agree with this
opinion. They should win by two
or more touchdowns. The game
isn’t until December first. so each
of the teams will have a, chance to
rest up—ah, so like the games
around here.

We want to give a few lines to
the letters to the Ed. department.
We receive them and providing
that there are no slams against the
constitution or government of the
United States, no swearing and the
name or names of the writers are
included, then we will print them.
Now that's not hard is it? And as
for not liking to receive them—that
is a malicious rumor started by our
dear fourth page enemies. So—
any time you have a gripe (and who
hasn't) that concerns in any way
sports here at college, you can air
it by writing it out, signing your
name and sending it in. The really
important item is signing your
name, in case you do write in be-
cause it kills us to have to disregard
a perfectly lovely wild letter simply
because it's not signed.

We would also like to mention the
co-operat-ion we have received from
WAA this year with regard to giv-
ing us information about the events
We report on. In this way. We are
able to have one of our very able
reporters (plug) on hand to watch
the games and write up the stories.
Then everybody is happy - WAA
because we're reporting on their
events and us because we have
some news to print!

But what about MAA’s elections?
The current excuse is that not
enough fellows show up for meet-
ings to have an election. 50 does
that mean that MAA will go along
for the rest of the year because not
enough fellows are interested in
getting together to elect another
director? MAA is sponsoring enough
activities to warrant. direction by

- an MAA director. '30 how about it

fellows-let’s get on the ball and
get that election over with.

We should, there- 0

 

'.i‘ STATE COLLEGIINEVVS} FRIDAY. NOVEMBER 1'6." 1045

iii Play-off
All StarTeamPicked;
Secon-dSquad'l'ol’lay.

Skidmore is coming to State to-
morrow for a hockey field day to be
held on the Dorm Field at 2:30 P.M.

This event has been a long time
coming, but the eventful day is now
hear at hand. This is the first time
that a play day has been arranged
with an out of town team in many
a year, and win or lose,‘WAA has
started something that should go

 

n.

Considering that approximately
sixty women turn out for hockey,
more play days should be planned,
not only in hockey, but also in oth-
er sports. If hockey is important
enough to be taught in the gym
classes twice a week for a period of
eight weeks, it is important enough
to hold the interests of the students
in intercollegiate rivalry.

Two Games

It is expected that two teams will
be playing at the same time as this
is one of the prerequisites of a
play day.

The Sophomores constitute a
majority of the first team number-
ing six. The Juniors follow with
three, and the Seniors are not far
behind with two representatives.
The frosh as yet have not produced
any outstanding hockey players, but
four ’49ers will play on the second
team. Four Sophomores, and two
Juniors will complete the team.
Skidmore’s Team

Skidmore has had excellent teams
in the last few years and is expect-
ed to live up to its reputation this
year. With its course in physical
education, sports are stressed, and
this game promises to pit State’s
best against Skidmore teams.

The lineups for State:

First Team Second Team
Seymour, ’46 LW Ineson, ’49
Dunn, ’46 LI Tilden, ’48
Quinn, ’48 CF Owens, ’49

Maginess, ’48
Hegginger, ’48
Diener, '47
Moberg, ’49

Sweeney, ’47 RI
Pascuzzi, ’48 RW
Campbell, ’47 LH
Margot, ’47 CH

Diﬂin, ’48 RH Tichy, ’48
Diehl, ’48 LF Yeardon, ’48
Rand, ’48 RF Harris, ’49
Daly, ’48 G Wakin, ’47

Ricci, '48, Joslin, '49, and Pless,
’49, will fill in the forward line with
Stittig, '49 in one of the halfback
positions. Anderson, ’49, will sub-
stitute in the goalie spot.

Communication . . .

To the Sports Editor:

For the past two or three weeks
there has been a rumor going
around that MAA isn’t living up to
its “promises.”

As far as we can see there is no
truth in the statement because up
to the present day MAA has been
carrying on some form of activity.
What about the football games and
the Ping Pong tournament which is
now in its final stages? Or don’t
they count?

We also feel that MAA should be
allowed to leave “the dungeon of
suppression” and be given the same
freedom any other organization on
campus receives. A current exam-
ple of this was the State-Siena. foot-
ball game. When State was to play
Siena. MAA was told either to play
it elsewhere or cancel the game as
the field was taken. This seems to
be the same answer received when
other MAA events had been ar~
ranged for the field.

We think that preference should
be given to these intercollegiate
sports events over lntramurals since
it is the only opportunity that this
college has for competition with
other schools in the field of sports.

Since the men are willing to up-
hold State traditlons~why not sup-
port them in their efforts?

Tomorrow

Athletic Points
Spotlite Rivalry
Sport Score Tied

Sporting events constitute twenty-
two and one-half points of the final
rivalry score. Since this is almost
one-half of the total sixty points
awarded, it is of great importance
that sports should hold the interest
of not only the rivalry classes, but
also the entire school.

Considering that the sports
events have been almost evenly
split so far, we can see that each
classic will be fought to the bitter
end. This year both competing
classes have shown outstanding
skill in all forms of athletics.

Campus Day

On Campus Day, for the first
time in many years, the freshmen
topped the Sophs in the one hun-
dred yard dash, the three-legged
race and the old clothes race, win-
ning three points. ’48 trailed With
a score of one point acquired by
crossing the line first in the sack
race. The, Sophs also failed to win
the relay races last year.

However, on November 8, ’48 in-
creased its score by beating the
freshmen, 2-0 in the hockey game.
Both teams were excellent on de-
fense, but ’49 lacked that extra
drive the Sophs had. The ’48ers
had played together for a longer
period of time and this gave them
a slight edge over the frosh.

Rivalry Score

The rivalry score then stood 3-3
as far as sports were concerned. Of
course the frosh received one and
one-half points for the Campus Day
skit, bringing the total score to 41/2-
3 in their favor.

Basketball season starts directly
after Thanksgiving and after tWO
months of practice, the rivalry bas-
ketball game will be held. Three
points will be awarded to the class
whose team wins two out of three
games. Last year ’48 was defeated.
This year because of practice with
the house teams and added practice
with the class team, '48, is favored,
but the frosh are not lacking in
spirit and teamwork and great things
are expected of them.

Winter Sports

The winter sports, ping pong,
swimming and bowling will net a
total of six and one-half points. In
the bowling matches the three
points will be awarded to the class
which is successful in two out of
three matches. This is an event in
which both the men and women will
participate, since there will be a
team of each.

Softball will be featured in the
spring season. Forty—nine showed
great promise during frosli camp
and at that time, working as a
unit, it has an excellent chance to
beat the Sophs.

Cheering Counts

Cheering at all these events are
scored and on Moving-Up Day five
points are awarded to the class that
originated and presented the best
cheers. Even if you don't partici-
pate in the athletic events you can
still help your class by showing up
at the games and cheering your re-
spective team along.

WAA Maiden Hayride
By light of Silvery Moon

. “We are old cowhands out
in Slingerlands! '

Oh, the moon is bright and
the hay is grand!

But there ain’t no men to
hold our hands!"

Such tear-jerking melodies
were raised above the clipety-
elop of horses hoofs during the
WAA hayride. Occasionally a
piercing scream rang out when
the hores pulling the second wa-
gon hungered for a strand of
Binn’ soft, once fragrant hair.
Ellie, you look simply devastat-
ed—oops, I mean devastating—-
in short hair, however uneven!

Wasn't that hot chocolate de-
licious, gals? Yes, it looked
slightly anemic and smacked of
apples, but it was hot choco-
late. The entertainment was
super and definitely tied in with
the informal theme of the eve-
ning.

A great deal of formerly unre-
vealed prowess and skill was dis-
covered during the volley ball

. game. Athletes, where have you
been hiding your talents?

 

Zippin Defeated;
Weiner - Wagner
Meet In Finals

The last game of the semi—finals
of the MAA ping-pong tournament
was played off last. Wednesday. Herb
Weiner downed Cal Zippin three out
of four games. This leaves only the
final match between Wagner and
to be played off.

In the match between Zippin and
Wiener, it looked as if Zippin was
going to give Weinei‘ more than a
little trouble. Zippin has a style that
is hard to beat. His main asset is
that he keeps his opponent on his
toes by his variety of surprise
strikes. On the other hand, Weiner
has no special outstanding feature,
but plays an offensive or defensive
game equally well. His style is con-
sistent, and his strokes do not vary
a great deal in force.

The first game was very even.
There was little difference in the
score right from the beginning. Both
players were nervous and not up to
their usual form, but it looked like
Zippin's game from the very begin-
ning, and he followed through by
taking the game 21-19.

In the second game both players
gained confidence and started out
with determination. Both players
worked into top form. and for a
while it looked like anybodys game.
Unlike Zippin who gains confidence
when he is winning, Welner plays
better in a clinch. Weiner led at
first, but the score evened up at 16-
16. Zippin tried to keep on a par
with Weiner, and for a moment
there was great indicision. They
volleyed for a period of two min-
utes. Weiners steady defensive fin-
ally proved superior to Zippins sur-
prise plays and Weiner set Zippin
back to the tune of 21-16.

The third and fourth games were
Weiners from the start. However,
toward the very end of the fourth
the tension was once more built up.
Welncr started off with a three
point lead which he maintained un-
til the very end of the game. Zippin
caught up to make the score deuce.
For a moment it was again any-
bodys game. Zippin rallied to make
the next point. but Weinor came
through with two smashing drives,
and made the next two points in
succession taking the game and pro-
moting himself to the finals.

Council Selects
Basketball Heads

Games Start In Dec.,

New Members Initiated

WAA held a Council meeting,
Tuesday, November 13, to plan the
fall sports program.

It has been announced by Mary
Seymour, ’46, President of WAA,
that the basketball tournament will
be started directly after Thanks-
giving vacation. Sweeney and Bak-
er, Juniors, and Quinn, ’48, have
been named captains of this sport.

These girls have asked that all
teams wishing to participate in the
intramural basketball tournament
should hand in their names before
vacation begins. The schedule
will be planned during the recess.

Each house on campus is request-
ed to field a team as this will cre-
ate rivalry and spirit between the
groups. Last year sixteen teams
participated in the league. They
were Stokes Hall, Newman Hall,
Moreland Hall, Chi Sig, Wren Hall,
Kappa Delta, Psi Gain, Phi Delta,
Beta Zeta, Alpha Epsilon Phi,
Sayles Hall, Rares, Dynamiters,
Whiz Kids, Tommy More, and Gam-
ma Kap. Pierce Hall dropped out
of the schedule but it is hoped that
it will combine some of its groups
and form a team that is representa-
tive of the dorm.

Gamma Kap won the basketball
cup last year taking it from Chi Sig
who won for the ’43-’44 season. In
order to keep the cup permanently,
a team must win the tournament
for three consecutive years, so com-
petition among the group houses is
strong.

Muriel Owens and Margaret Sea-
man, newly elected Representative
and Manager of the Class of '49,
Were installed as members of the
Council.

The freshmen representatives
were appointed as the committee in
charge of refreshments for the

lay day tomorrow against Skid-
more. All of the Council will act
as members of the Reception Com-
mittee.

WAA Tea Held;

Freshmenlntroduced

Tea Time was here again! WAA,
under the leadership of Mary Lydia
Seymour, ’46, President, sponsored
a tea yesterday for the faculty and
members of the student body, in the
Lounge.

The freshmen were introduced to
the athletically inclined upperciass-
men and those sport enthusiasts of
'49 were met by State.

Last year Women’s Athletic As-
sociation also sponsored a tea and
this proved so successful that it.
has now become a tradition.

Edna Swoeney, ’47, and Wilma
Diehl, '48, spoke on their experiences
at hockey camp this summer and
Chuck Axelrod, '4'7, staged a fencing
exhibition.

Miss Johnston. Miss Foster, Mary
Seymour and Gettc Dunn poured.

Lucky (?)‘Car Owners Have
Hazardous Journeys Home

There are those that enjoy
their trips home for vacation
and then there are others . . .

It seems as how a couple of
lucky car owners had some
trouble on the way to New York
a week ago Tuesday. Dauntless
Minnie was put-putting inerriiy
on her way when “\vhain!
squish!" and that was one tire.
Before long it was two tires and
the end ofypoor Minnie.

Kaufman’s car apparently de-
cided it was not to be outdone
for it. was rolling into New York
when “Wham! squish!”—yep, you
guessed it. And then there’s the
little mailer of getting back to
Alvany—no, no flat tires, it. was
the clutch lhis lime—it slipped.

After this calamity, the be-
dragglcd occupants sacrificed
their meager fortunes for a ride
to Poughkecpsic where they
struggled into the railroad sta-
tion. The fitting climax would
be to have the train break down.
but honest, it didn’t.
