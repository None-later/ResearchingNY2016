-— By MARY LIZ SULLIVAN ——

It’s amazing, but outside of a few
minor casualties where the turkey
got the better of the hatchet, every-
body seems to have had a wonderful
time over the vacation. Isn’t it won-
derful to be back to school working
again? Now we begin thinking about
Christmas and it’s only 18 more
days ’till we have another vacation.
Speaking of the glorious season
leads us to think of the WAA bulle-
tin board which is all decked out
again in the Christmas colors. ’Lil’
Mindy is the cleverest gal! So please
take heed of the signs on the board
and “be athletic while you wait.”

Something happened to the volley-
ball tourney—just exactly what no
one can seem to agree on, but it
did fizzle out. The fresh and Sophs
played their game and were waiting
for the second game with the Winner
of the Junior-Senior tilt and they
are still waiting. That’s where the
trouble came in. The other teams
either couldn’t get enough kids who
were willing to play or else they
couldn’t agree on a time to play.
However another tourney is being
started by WAA, it’s the ping-pong
tournament which should begin
soon; If this is as successful as the
MAA ping-pong tourney was, we Will
have nothing but praise for those
participating. Last year the tourna-
ment was won by Ray Weiss and we
note from the sign-up sheet that she
has signed up for this year’s tourna-
ment.

Army-Navy

Side-tracking for a minute or two,
we hear that quite a few people are
getting new tubes for their radios
so they will be able to listen to the
Army-Navy game tomorrow. We are
renting a radio for the afternoon.
We hold to the statement previously
made in this column (a week ago)
that Army will win by more than
two touchdowns. They will win. that
is, unless something drastic happens
to three or four of the members of
their team.

About Spiders

And then we would like to recom-
mend that those sadists who go
around picking up spiders to tor-
ment people with. be given a list of
the other sports we have here at
State so they could spend their lei-
sure time “doing something con-
structive" for a change. And some
people wonder why we wake up in
the middle of the night screaming,
"Take them away, they have 32 legs
and they're crawling all over me!"

Basketball Starts

The season starts again as prac-
tice for one sport in which most of
the. college is interested. begins. Wc
are, of course. talking about the
basketball tournament in which
there is usually so much keen compe-
tition. Last year. approximately sixv
teen teams participated in the league
and the rivalry spirit evident from
the beginning was carried through-
out the season. ll. is expcclcd thal
as Luany teams. if not more. will
again enter this your. The schedule
would go along faster, if the teams
would have all their players prl-senl
on lime and if they could avoid
postponing games. 'l‘hcsc were the
main faults in lhe [day-offs last
year. The eommulcrs are also plun-
ning on having a team participate
in the league this your. If so, il will
be the first time For our money.
this shows more spirit than some
of the houses that are "on campus."
It seems like a difficult project as
most of the games are played at
7:00 in the evening and lhc commu-
ters either have to go home ralhcr
late or in some cases arrange in slay
in some group house or at the dorm.
There are many commuters that
have also come out for sports this
year. So far, the commuters have
shown spirit, at least in this depart-
ment and We wish them a lot of
luck with their basketball team.

s'rArI: COLLEGE NEWS, FRIDAY.’ NOVEMBER 30, 1495

Basketball Season Starts;

Squads Are

Baker, Sweeney, Quinn
Take Over Practices

WAA officially opened the bas-
ketball season this Week when prac-
tices were held Monday afternoon
and Wednesday night.

Sweeney and Baker, Juniors, and
Quinn, ’48, were in charge of these
scrimmages and ably directed the
proceedings. About fifty women
came out for practice on each of
the days, with the fresh outnum-
bering the upperclassmen about two
to one.

Frosli Guards

The fresh have an over abund-
ance of good guards, but are lack-
ing forwards. Of course, not all of
’49‘s basketball players showed up
for the practice scrimmages, but
they will have to work hard to de—
velop some point-scoring players.

Last Wednesday, the outstanding
group of forwards was that of New-
man, composed of Maggie, Straub.
and Cooper. Maggio played an out-
standing game putting the ball
through the 1100p from the halfway
mark several times.

Pedisich, Baker, and Quinn made
up a snappy set and outplayed
their opponents. Dunn, Diehl, Dif-
fin, Shapiro. and Sweeney, last
year’s returning veterans of the
guard posts were ably holding down
goal tending positions.

Anderson and Joslin were the two
most promising forwards of the
fresh group ‘vhile Midgely. Hawkins,
and Moberg were excellent on de-
fense. "

Teams Enter

Fourteen teams have been enter-
ed in the WAA tournament with
one new addition from last year.
Western Hall. the new team, is a
squad composed entirely of fresh-
men. Psi Gamma. Kappa Delta,
Beta Zeta, Gamma Kappa Phi, Al-
pha Epsilon Phi, Rares. Chi Sigma
Theta. Phi Delta. Newman Hall,
Wren Hall. Commuters Club. Sayles
Hall and the Whiz Kids. have also
entered the league. As yet Stokes
Hall, Farrell House, and Morcland
Hall have not entered but it is hop-
ed that they will do so, so that
every house on campus will have a
team representing it. The list of
players and the captains must be
in the hands of one of the captains
no later than today at 4:30 so that
the schedule may be planned.

Practices are being planned for
the next few weeks and the tourna-
ment will probably start the week
before Christmas vacation on the
fifteenth. The next general prac-
tice will be tomorrow at 2:30.
New Rules

The captains have given out the
following rules which will regulate
the schedule:

1. Each team must have one ex—
tra person to act as timokccpcr or
as scorckecpcr. This person will be
considered a. regular member of the

Wagner Takes
Ping Pong Game
In Final Match

The MAA ping pong singles came
to an end this Week as Paul Wag-
ner, new at State this year, came
out on top by beating Herb Weiner
Wednesday afternoon. Wagner,
dark horse of the tournament,
\veeded out his opponents and
steadily worked himself up into the
finals. The results didn’t come as
too much of a surprise since Wag-
ner had beaten such formidable
fees as Phil Lashinsky and Art
Kaufman, def-ending champ.

Both Wagner and Weiner Were in
top form but after Wagner got
warmed up he couldn’t be held
down. Weiner got the serve in the
first game and obtained a beautiful
lead with 4-1, increasing it to 14-3.
Then Wagner popped up and really
started to play using a terrific slam.
Nevertheless Weiner took the game
21-18. In the second game the first
six points went to Wagner and the
next four to Weiner. Weiner pull-
ing his score up from 15-7 to 15-11
only to lose, 21-12. It seemed that
this would be a close filial but
Wagner took Weiner 21-8 in the
third, using a terrific cut that kept
Weiner reaching to all sides of the
table. The first 16 points of the
fourth game were evenly split. This
time Weiner turned the tables on
Wagner and had him hopping all
over to retrieve his trick shots but
Wagner again won, 21-12. The
score now stood three to one, the
finals being a four out of seven
match. The tension was high be-
tween both players, since if Wagner
took this game he would be the
new champion. In the fifth game
Weiner put forth his best effort by
slicing both during volleys and on
serves. The first six were Weiner's
and it seemed that he would win
this game but Wagner pulled out of
his slump and won. 21-18.

All five of the games were excep—
tionally fast lasting only four to
five minutes each. The opponents
played continuously from 3:30 to
3:55. taking time out only to change
sides after each of the games.

This by; brought the ping pong
series up [0 the half way mark. The
singles are over with and the
doubles are beginning next week.
Much enthusiasm and interest has
been displayed this year for ping
pong during the singles and should
crnlinuc on during the second part
of the tournament.

In the last issue we predicted
that Weiner would probably beat
Wagner . . . anybody can make a
mistake. Here and now we offer
our congrutulations lo the new sin-
gll“; champ.

Repair:

The following was given to us to
write in feature opinion form, rath-

 

, er than as a communication. Sports

Ed. Note.

It’s good to see MAA get under-
way, but the question still remains:
“How long will MAA last on camp-
us?” Only seven fellows showed
up for elections. This is a very
small percentage of the fellows here
at State. There is no reason for
this small attendance at the meet-
ing which was given due publicity.
It is impossible to keep an orgas-
ization of this sort on campus and
appropriate money for it when it
benefits such a small number of
students. How can MAA expect the
student body to become interested
in an organization in which fellows
themselves show no interest.

MAA has its arguments too.
There’s talk about not being able
to get the gym because the girls
had signed up first, and late classes,
and lack of opposing teams. We‘ll
grant the first point, but the fol-
lows that uscd to be here had
classes too. There is enough oppo-
sition, but could MAA put a team
on the floor right now?

The number of fellows coming
back in January is certainly en—
couraging, but it looks like ath-
letics here at State will be at a
minimum until then. It is im-
possible to have an athletic organ—
ization without athletic material,
and it must be admitted that the
follows in general are not interest—
ed or aren't able to play sports. For
those who aren‘t able. there’s an
excuse. However, for those just un—
interested, it's about time they de-
veloped seine school spirit and did
their bit to put State on top again.

Hats off to the few fellows who
are showing an interest and mak-
ing an effort to boost MAA. Per—
haps the fellows who come back in
January will set about to put State
back in the athletic world—it does
not look as if the fellows here now
are going to do too much about it!

tains of those teams intending to

Sayles Summons Sfudenfs
To Discuss Assembly Cuts

Because there have been too
many vacant seats in assembly
lately, Dr. John M. Sayles,
President of the College, is sum-
moning a rather lengthy list of
students to his office to discuss
their assembly cuts.

Assemblies were inaugurated
for both social and government-
al purposes. It is only through
the assembly program that the
student body, as a Whole, has a
chance to voice its opinions on
the issues at hand.

This year, the same as every
other year, all students are re-
quired to attend every assembly
program. Only those Seniors
who are practice teaching at ‘
this time are excused. v

All those who make an-
nouncements in assembly should
contact the delegate appointed
by Student Council for the reg-
istering of their attendance.
The name of this delegate will
be announced in the near future.

Waldo Defeats
Five Candidates
In Close Battle

Bertha Wakin, ’47. was elected
Junior member to the Student
Board of Finance in the revote
which was held last Friday in as—
sembly. Miss Wakin won the elec-
tion on the fifth distribution by 32
votes.

A revote for this election was nec-
essary because in the first election
no candidate succeeded in achiev-
ing a quota. It was felt that this
was partly due to the extraordinary
number of blank ballots (82). For
the latter reason, plus the fact that
certain preferential voting experts
believe that the achievement of a
quota is essential for election to an
office, Myskania, the Judicial
Branch of the State College govern-
ment, passed down the decision that
revoting was necessary.

Christmas Season To Open Wlll’l "Tinsel And Tobleoux"

With glistening tinsel and spark-
ling songs. State will welcome the
holiday season with their annual
Big-8.

State's Christmas season opens its
doors next Thursday night to usher
in peace, harmony and good will
with the religious elubs' annual
Big-8, “Tinsel and Tablcaux.“ A
true spirit of Christmas will reign
as each religious group displays the
tale of their interpretation of
Christmas.

A hushed audience will gaze upon
the reverent scenes of Christ's birth
in Bethlehem as Mary and Joseph.
Gloria Mchrran and Bill Mallory,
plod along their yearly Journey to
Nazareth.

As Newman's, “Venitc Adoremus"
reinacts the events of the first
Christmas Eve. a chorus of voices
oarolling Christmas Hymns. will
ring out in His praise. Then the
house lights will grow bright and

State. will retrace its steps from
Bethlehem back to Page, still nour-
ishing a tender spirit of Christmas
in their hearts.

But there are other types of
Christmas celebration, and when
the house lights dim once more, a
sleepy child. played by Muriel Ru-
bin, slumbers peacefully on oblivi-
ous to her surroundings. Her
grandfather appears and with
tender twinkle in his eyes as he
gazes upon the sleeping child, he
begins his tale.

A chorus of voices sings softly in
the background as the story of
l-lanulcuh. the Jewish holiday
which coincides with Christmas, is
unfolded in the child's dreams.

When the house lights go down
for the third time, the program
takes on a lighter vein. Good old
Santa, Joe Palevsky. laughs his
jolly way onto the stage in the SCA
skit. In traditional good heart-

:3

ed manner, he shall brighten the
lives of two orphaned children and
become lord and master of the SCA
toyshop.

A traditional American scene will
highlight this part of the entertain-
ment and Snow White and the
seven dwarfs will supplement the
ducts, trios, ballet number and tap
dancing which make up the pro-
gram. The SCA presentation will
feature mostly individual acts.

As the third animal Christmas
Big-8 draws to a close. a general
holiday atmosphere will prevail
War the audience. State's Christ-
mas comes early in the season and
the Big-8 helps to launch it well on
its way.

At the close of the evening, State's
population will leave for home.
marching briskly over the snow.

cil meeting Wednesday night

plans were made for a Student

Union Day to be held some time in December.

The Sophomores will open the assembly program with their
fight song and the freshmen will follow with theirs. Next
will come the rival songs to each of the two classes and the
program will end with the singing of the Alma Maters to

original words and music.

Judging

 

Comrades Of Sisterhood

The originality, appropriatness
and execution of the song will be

Proclaim "on To Smolensk” used as a medium for the judging

“You are a snowflake;
You are a pie-crust;

You are a raisin wrinkle;

You are a frog‘s right car;

You are a caraway seed;

You are a pigeon feather;

You are a Bab-O label

If you are able . . . "

Comrades, you too may chant
the inspiring anthem of the
Sisterhood of the Smolensk (not
insk. pinsk or minsk) Sirens and
and the affiliated orders of the
Mermaids of Murmansk and the
Comrades of the Caucasus.
Join the new order and take
part in the solemn initiation
ceremony of treading vodka in
a samovar for two hours; then
drink your wag. to dry land
while the choir sings a cheer-
ful chorus:

“I despise you,

I loath you.

I detest you.”
