—;- By MARY LIZ SULLIVAN ——

Some kind soul keeps track of the
number of days until Christmas and
then records it on the P. 0. board
every day. You are wondering, no
dsubt, why we should mention this
trivial matter. Well, as we look at
the board while typing (which incl,-
dentally accounts for the typogra-
phical errors on this page) we no-
tice that there are only 11 more
school days and 17 more days until
Christmas. Now this makes a great
difference in our life. When any
member of the staff becomes dis-
couraged, (a thing which very rare-
ly happens) we refer them to the
board and they brighten up imme-
diately. Wonderful morale builder

We bet that a lot of people
thought that because Army won the
game last week, they would play in
the Rose Bowl. This, however, is
far from true. Army was the first
choice of the Rose Bowl committee
until almost as late as Thanksgiv-
ing but because of that well known
tape, colored red, the Army decision
was not given in time and the com-
mittee invited Alabama. The moral
to this story is—lf you want to have
sugar in your bowl, go where the
cane is!

Snoop Explained

Incidentally, the Sport Snoop is
the other half of the inquiring re-
porter and it knocks itself out try-
ing to outdo everybody else in the
snooping field to inquire into the
inner parts of the minds here in
school. The purpose of the column
is to give the kids a chance to air
their opinions on various sports
questions to see how some of the
students feel about a certain topic.

About Mayo

We were wondering whether or
not to include Eddie Mayo's seven
“musts” in this week’s issue (see the
last col. over). The reason was
that we didn’t know whether or not
enough people would know who Ed-
die Mayo was. So we asked one of
our illustrious columnists, “Do you
know who Eddie Mayo is?“ “Why,
of course, don't be silly, he's the one
that runs the clinic with his broth-
er." Now that really floored us!
By the way, we are not in the hab~
it of divulging names and so we
wouldn't dream of saying who told
us that. but we have only three col-
umnists and it wasn't Mindy, lt
wasn't Kilt—so look and see who's
left. Now we wouldn't dream of
telling but . . .

Athletic Pledges

The sororities are glad to have
their pledges for more than one
reason. It seems that in quite a
few cases, these pledges are filling
in the necessary spaces on their
sorority teams. This is a good idea
as in this way probably several
frosh who would otherwise not get
to play on regular teams will have
an opportunity to play in the lea-
gue.

Sports Director

Monday, Betty Margot. '47, was
elected Sports Director of Saylcs.
As far as we know, this may be the
case in a few of the dorms and
group houses but it is not true of
all of them. We think that on the
whole. it is an excellent idea. Too
often, in the smaller group houses
especially, there is no one person
who is made responsible for the
sport teams in which the house
participates. If each house had one
such director. who would keep track
of the games the team was suppos—
ed to play. it would eliminate the
confusion which often arises be—
cauac of the lacs of such a director.
Congratulations Margot! Maybe
some of the other group houses will
follow Sayles' example and elect
their director soon.

Oh. you're dreaming of a white
Christmas—well on. sleep on.

STATE CbLLEGE NEWS. FRIDAY; DECEMBER 7. 1945

First Results

In Bowling:

Phi Delta Wins Game

Seymour, Meyers Star,-
Causse Leads cwmcn

The WAA Bowling tournament
got underway this week with two
games played Tuesday and two
rolled off on Thursday.

Phi Delta overtook Newman with
a lead of 95 pins. Seymour, ’46, hit-
ting 169 and 142, was high scorer of
the afternoon. Causse led for New-
man with an average of 123. Only
two games were rolled instead of
the customary three. Phi Delta is
credited with a win by taking two
games. The results of the Sayles-
Psi Gamma game were incomplete
since neither team had five players
who completed two games. These
will be bowled some time before
Tuesday. From the games bowled
Tuesday, it is hard to tell who’ll
tome out on top in this contest.

Results Incomplete

On Thurday, Stoke met Wren
while Moreland bowled against BZ.
The results of these games have not
yet been completed.

Next week finds KD vs. Wren Hall
while Gamma Kap.will bowl against
AEPhi.

According to Captains Louise
Winters and Sue Campbell, Juniors,
if a team does not appear without
contacting the captains, that game
is automatically forfeited.

Games Called

Games are called for 3:30 on
Tuesday and Thursday afternoons
at Rice’s Alleys. It would be well
if those who expect to bowl on
teams get to Rice's by 3:45 at the
latest so that games will be finish-
ed on the scheduled days.

From the results of this week's
games, it looks as though bowling is
going to come into it‘s own here at
State College. The team that comes
in first in the YVAA tournament will
have to do some hitting. This game
of ten pins is no cinch. The com-
petition is going to get stiffer as
the teams get more practice.

Many people wonder now State
compares With other colleges in the
sport iieid. Such quesnons as what
sports do other coueges have whicn
we do not have and the sports we
have that other coiieges do not
have, oiten arise.

We have read through the sport
seetiuns of other papers in an ef-
fort to answar Diiese and other
questions about sports. below we
present our findings—how do we
compare?

Polytechnic Reporter, Brooklyn

Allotments were made for sports
amounting to $3,815 101' basketbail,
r.11e, tennis and wrestling. Here
we should remember, however, that
this school is made up entirely of
male students which accounts for
the large budget allowance. Well
we could have wrestling here — or
maybe we are better without it!
This same school is also offering
$$$$$ prizes to the person who comes
closest in guessing the scores of the
Poly basketball games. Now if we
can find some kind benefactor, we
will also do that.

The Campus, Univ. of Rochester

Here the main emphasis is placed
on basketball. Wrestling again
comes into the picture as the wrest-
ling teams entertam the audience
between basketball halves. This is
designed to give the audience a true
picture of college wrestling.
Indiana Penn, Indiana, Pa.

Indiana has a Winter Sports Club
which takes care of the winter
sports activities at the college. Ski-
ing, tobogganihg, hiking and roller
skating are the prospects. Ice
skating if suitable ice can be found
will also be sponsored. These are
familiar sports around State, that
is all except the skiing and We
really don't have time for that any
way.

Tempo, Chicago State Teachers
College

This state Teachers College feat-
ures swimming classes, basketball
and a description of a WAA party
given for the frosh really sounded
like fun. A miniature golf course
and bowling alley was set up in the
gym. Highlighting the program was
a swimming exhibition featuring a
water ballet.

Well so much for that—sports at
State compare well don’t they? In
fact we seem to have a wider vari-
ety of sports than many other col-
leges. Nice going!

5110414 ﬂied compact

Things on the water front have
yet to bubble, but Marion Kragh,
'48, Captain of life-saving, says
that all the comer-outcrs have re-
ally entered into it. Right now the
girls are learning how to save sub-
merged victlms This year over
twenty girls have joined. which is
quite an increase over last year's
classes.

Pat Tildeii, '48. has decided not
to start the swimming classes until
after the Christmas vacation. Then
the classes will probably be held on
Tuesday and Friday afternoons.

Meanwhile. those who wish to
sign-up are urged to do so.

“Questions, questions, always more
questions" . . . but this one is really
good. “How would you create more
interest in sports here at State. It
seems that the question has pro-
voked more interest than anything
else has, so let's move on to the
answers.

In between ping-pong shots Alice
Eisner, "its, and Joe zianchelli, ’49,
had time enough to agree that
State should set Lip teams in sports,
sucn as bassetbail, to play other
colleges and also more intramural
teams. Joe wants more men's
sports and Molly Wliclly, ’49, agrtes
With him wholeheartedly. Then
Wilma Diehl, ’48, said if more up-
perclassmen would come, maybe it
would spur the freshmen to turn
out.

Peg Daly, ‘48, “I’d have more men
coacnes like us Whiz Kids have!”
if that doesn’t create a lot of in-
terest nothing will.

Down at basketball practice the
players had a lot of ideas. Rosalie
Pooler, ’47—The interest is strong
in basketball and softball but not
in the minor sports such as arch-
ery, swlmming and volleyball. I
was never interested in ping-pong
beiore the tournament but now I
am. Try and build up the minor
sports like that."

Pat Tilden, ’48—“More emphasis
on sports and less on books." Helen
Honcycombc, ’47 —— “I’d encourage
everyone to come to practice Just
for fun not only to get on a team.”
Jean Munro, ’49—“Make sure all
the freshmen know what the WAA
awards are. Attach more honor to
the ceremony of presenting the
awards.” "Lovey" Tronsor, ’48—
“I‘d like Saturday night games with
a dance afterwards.” Ho hum, we
can all dream.

Gloria Baker, '47—“Sponsor more
play-clays. A lot of the kids feel
that only experienced players have
a chance to get on teams. The be-
ginners should be encouraged.”

Muriel Owens, '49—“Oi‘ganize a
system of graduated classes and
have kids advance from one group
to the next until they’re good enough
to play on a team."

Dot Diffin, ’48—“More competitive
sports will arouse spirit and incen~
t.ve to play.”

Molly Mulligan. ‘49 —"Cut out
everything else." She's got some-
thing there.

Louise Winters. '47—“Let the two
top teams in the different sports
put on exhibition games before the
whole school."

“M.ckey" Navy, '46—"Have a vari-
ety of' sports taught in gym classes
so everyone will know how to play
a lot of sports. This will bring
more people out for WAA events."

Mary Quinn. ’48-“Serve punch
1?) between halves."

Evelyn Stephan, '48—“Give more
awards for the amount of time put
in."

Mindy Warshaw, ’47~—”Get lots
of fellas to cheer. Offer one man
free with every ten hours spent
athletically." Now that's a very
good suggestion.

And having asked. the Sports
Snoop moves on.

‘Sporls Advice ‘

Given By Mayo;
Slates 7 Musfs

By PAULA TICHY

In last month’s issue of the St.
Bona Venture, Eddie Mayo, whose
excellent work in promoting the
Detroit Tigers to World Champion-
ship won him the Sporting News
“Oscar” last season, in a speech
given at the college, listed the fol-
lowing seven “musts” for success in
athletics:

1. First, you must have an abid-
ing interest in baseball. In his es-
timation abiding, all-consuming in-
terest in baseball, was of primary
importance. The budding sports-
man must bear patiently the breaks
of the game, wait patiently for the
big chance that is bound to come
his way, and keep his ambitions
alive and fixed on a goal.

2. He stressed physical condition
and put particular emphasis on the
fact that good living habits and a
well-rounded routine are character-
istics of an athlete.

3. This point called for self-
study—a young athlete should take
stock of his abilities and assets to
that he can gauge his way and rate
himself accordingly. By recogniz-
ing his faults and shortcomings, he
can correct himself and better his
game.

4. He must hustle all the time.
Speed, on the ball field, in all his
actions, and thoughts, in making
decisions, is desirable.

5. Mayo stressed the importance
of continuing in school until one is
finished with his education, wheth-
er he be in high school, college or
in the minor leagues.

6. This was a plea to the young-
sters to heed the words of wisdom
and advice of their parents and
others in a position to guide them.

7. With this final point, Mayo
was deadly serious, without elabor-
ation he admonished the youthful
members of his audience, "Always
keep faith with God.”

Basketball Starts
Alter Vacation

Basketball has soared to new
heights this week. when more than
seventy-five women turned out for
practice on the scheduled days.
‘l‘hese open practices will continue
until after Christmas vacation,
when leagues games will be sched-
ulcd.

Sweeney. '47, co-captain of the
basketball league. has stated. "So
many of the students have request-
ed these practice sessions that we
have found it necessary to plan
them until vacation."

Some Additions

Latest addition to the basketball
scrimmages were Mickey Navy. '46,
Golden and Owens, freshmen, and
Tronser, '48. Krumkoltz, ’48, a
transfer, has proven to be an out-
standing guard. and will bolster up
AEPhl's team on the defense.

Gamma Kap's team. with Pedi-
sicli, Young and Quinn. will prob-
ably be the team to beat. They are
out to keep that cup and will be a.
hard combination to upset. 82 will
have a strong setup with Baker and
Maglnnes in the forward spots and
Dunn and Difiin in the guard posts.
They came in second last year, in a
close fight, and will have experienc-
cd substitutes.

Wlii'l. Kids

The Whiz Kids. ll comparatively
new team, will be in the fight right
to the end, with Tilden tossing
them through the hoop and Ricci
performing on the defense. KD
has a strong. experienced team this
your and will be up with the Will-
hers.

(iciicrul practice will be held
again tomorrow at 2:30. Captains
Sweeney, Baker. and Quinn have
lllekal that all women please be on
line.

Myskcnic -- A Reform -' B s '

The MYSKANIA cry has gone up again; However, it is no

longer the “to be or not to be” cry, but rather, shall we re-

form our Judicial body?

An open meeting was called on Wednesday to discuss this
question and to formulate tangible plans for reformation
that would later be presented in Assembly as a motion. Os-
tensibly, the meeting was proposed to garner a maximum
of student opinion on the subject. Sadly enough, however,
attendance was almost nil. Approximately twenty-five stu-
dents exhibited enough interest in the session to be present.
Nine of these were Myskania members. Here was the re-
sult of a whole semester’s griping—a 2%% interest in a
vital issue that is the concern of every student of State Col-

lege.

Despite the dearth of people, there was not a lack of ideas
or of frank discussion. The first concrete plan for reforma-
tion yet to come out of the Myskania embroilment was of-
fered. Its realistic approach to the problem and logical con-

clusions make it '1 plan that
by Student Association.

deserves serious consideration

It is this: Take from Myskania its power of self-perpetua—
tion and (110036 our Judiciary by popular vote. Popular
vote with qualifications, that is. Myskania would draw up
two slates of nominees and present them Ito Student Associa—
tion for vote. This would eliminate the popularity pool re-
sults of open nominations and insure a fair choice. The first
slate would list five to eight names of Juniors who, Myskania
feels, deserve this honor first. The second, a longer list,
would name other Juniors who are eligible. On the first slate
there would be yes or no voting and the second would entail

the preferential ballot. if a

member of the student body

feels that further nominations should be made, this would

be allowed.

in this way, the present breach that exists between Mys-
kanizi and Student Association would be spanned by popular

election of the body.

Here, at last, is a concrete plan. What is your opinion?

 

Veterans, Show
Will Entertain
Orphans Tonight

The Rhodes Hospital troupe show
will send three of its acts to the
Myskania Christmas Party at the
Albany Home for Children today
and part of it will perform on Stu—
dent Union Day. The Directors,
Lorna Kunz. Philip Lashinsky, Mu-
riel Rubin, Juniors and Eloise
Worth. '43. have sent out a plea for
hostesses for the show.

Marilyn Warshaw, Betty Brennan
and Vivien Nielson, Juniors, dressed
in regulation sailor suits, will pre—
sent a military tap dance for the
orphans at the Home and Muriel
Rubin. '47. will sing a solo. Agnes
McIntyre. ’49. will narrate fairy
tales. Other members of the show
who have not yet been chosen will
displin their talents in a show on
Student Union Day.

Hostesscs

 Kunz and Miss Worth have
sent out an urgent plea for hostesses
to help with the troupe show. 11:-
teriCWS have been scheduled for the
past few weeks but so far no one
has volunteered. Anyone wishing
to hostess must contact Miss Kunz
or Miss Worth anytime before
Christmas vacation.
lthodes Show

The troupe will leave state as
planned on Friday, January 4, at
3:30 PM. The show will be pre-
sented to the veterans at Rhodes at
7:30 RM. and the cast plans to be
back in Albany by i AM.

A chartered bus will transport the
troupe and two buses will be used
if hostesses are obtained. War Ac-
tivities Council treasury will defray
part of the xepcnscs but each incin-
bcr of the cast will contribute $1.00
to thc fund.

Indian, Revolutionary Relics
Comprise Display In Library

Miss Mary E. Cobb, College Ll-
briiriun. has announced that an ex-
hibit. of indiiiu and Revolutionary
War relics has been placed on dis—
play in the library by Yvonne Bou-
lla ’47. The articles in the show-
case, collected in the Fort. George
area. are explained by labels.

They include various types of bul-
let molds, shot. a bayonet. powder
horns, and a type of spade which
'was used in the Colonial and Revo-
lutionary period.

Miss Cobb requested that stu-
dents feel free to bring collections
of general interest in to the library.

 

Drooping Morfals Grasp
Al Precious Xmas Vacation

“Show me the way to go home
I’m tired and I wanna go to
bed."

As a soft, quiet spirit of
Christmas falls over the atmos-
phere at State, drooping indi-
viduals dragging their bags be-
hind them, slowly wend theh'
weary way to the station.

After three and a half weeks
of long hard work, State can at
last relax, breathe a sigh of re-
lief and allow its battered books
to gather dust. Fifteen prec-
ious days of freedom await
them.

State's rapidly failing health
will be given a chance to recu—
perate. And then on “that day"
when State will again resume its
college life, its population will
return minus the bleary eyes
and red noses so prevalent now.

With spirits stimulated and
cobwebs swept away by Yule-
tide gatherings, the students
will wade into their studies with
renewed zest. energy and am-
bition~

Former Film Reviewer Crilicizes
Frivolous Movies Shown Today

By CAROL CLARK

After ten months as motion pic-
ture reviewer for the New Yorker,
Wolcott Gibbs has resigned. His
reasons, given in an article in the
Saturday Review of Literature were
briefly those: “The cinema resists
rational criticism almost as firmly
as a six-day bicycle race, or per-
haps love . . . ninety per cent of
the moving pictures exhibited in
America are so vulgar, wit10ss and
dull that it is preposterous to write
about them in a publication not in-
tended to be read while chewing
gum."

Mr. Gibbs' article was written
from the viewpoint of u critic who
has been trying madly to find some-
l.hini; intelligent to say about pres-
ent-(lay movies, but the criticism
might have come from any thought-
ful movie-gocr.

Ostcnsibly, movies are purely for
entertainment, but their educational
and propaganda values are well rec-
ognized. Escape from realities
seems to be the dominant trend in
film production tpdny. even in some
of the most violent of war-inspired
movies. Adventure propaganda of—
fered in such a film as “The Span-
ish Main," for instance, would hard-
ly be taken seriously by any adult.

but a similar plot transferred to a
modern setting in it picture like
“Confidential Agent" might be
considered a true portrayal of an
espionage system.

Sometimes the propaganda is
harder to detect. as in “You Came
Along" but the same inference is
always there . . . the conflict is re-
solvcd and the hero completes his
task in a blaze of glory.

Not only do movies distort life in
general, but they do away with his-
toricul facts in an effort to make
life bright. Lately there has been
a trend towards the production of
biographies, of which "A Song To
Remember" and "Rhapsody in
Blue" are notable examples. Actual
events and Well—known character-
istics of the central figures are dls~
regarded and the movie-going pub-
lie is deceived into believing that
they have gained a true picture of
the person's life.

Mr. Gibbs made an exception of
documentary films and frank melo-
drama, as the first has very little
opportunity for distortion, and the
second is not intended to be taken
seriously. He blamed the public for
believing that "anything is possible,
even perfect happiness."

Riccio’s Band To Play

The midnight crowning of the
State College Snow Queen will high-

Armand Riccio and his orchestra,
a group from Schenectady. will sup-
ply the music for dancing which
