More Serious Dlgressing

On to a more serious topic, that
of the lack of infirmary facilities.
There have been epidemics similar
to the present one at State in the
past. Each year this question has
been put aside and disregarded as
the epidemic declined. Each year
students have become victims of
this illness and no infirmary large
enough to accommodate them all
is available. Dr. Green and .Dr.
Dorwaldt are rushed to death, paint-
ing throats and writing out pre-
scriptions. Just last week, nearly
one hundred dollars was spent on
doctor bills. This fact, alone, should
be sufficient to warrant bringing
the issue to a head this year or at
least to make definite preparations
for the near future. An example of
this need can be clearly shown by
an instance at one of the group
houses. There are four girls in one
room. At the beginning only one
girl was ill. Dut to these close liv-
ing quarters. two of her roommates
came down with the flu. This
means that three sick girls still
share the room w.th one other who
has. :1: far, escaped infection. If
the one first afflicted had been iso-
lated, most likely her roommates
would not have been infected.

Back to Sports

In a recent copy of “The Foot—
ball News," there was an article
which attracted our attention and
stimulated many opinions. The re—
porter noticed some soldiers wait-
ing outside the dressing rooms—
waiting for “their heroes, the Army
football players.” Thoughtfully, this
reporter went into the Army dress-
ing rooms and asked the manager
to ask the players if they would
stop and say a few words to these
war veterans. He said he would.
Half an hour before game time, the
Army team came out. None stop-
ped, but trotted right by the vets.
A few nodded, but nothing more.
I’ll quote the rest because I coulth
possib.y tell it more effectively.

"The war vets were plainly disap—
pointed. We apologized and said
perhaps the team was under orders
not to stop to talk to anyone before
a game.

“The three Vets said, ‘thanks,
anyway,’ and then went away — in
their wheel chairs.

“Each boy was without legs. One
has 'em .amputated at the, .mp8,
Another had stumps. The third
had ’em off below the knee."

They enjoyed the game very
much for Army won, 61-0, and after
all, “Army is their team.“

 

WAA Begins '45-’46

Ping Pong Tournament

KD) Grimm Kap

'Gain Victory In

WAA Matches

Worth, Pedisich Lead
With Individual Scores

WAA’s Bowling Tournament gain-
ed momentum this week as four
more teams engaged in mid-week
playoffs. 'Gamma Kap took the
first two games in a match with
AEPhi, and KD out-pointed Pierce
to gain a victory.

In the first game, Gamma Kap
ended with a margin of 91 pins to
defeat their opponents, 597-506.
Worth was high in this game with
a total of 147, while Alice Fischer
sparked the AEPhi team with a
score of 118. Gamma Kap rolled
up a lead of 177 to gain an over-
whelming victory of 671-494 in the
second game. Pedisich led Gamma
Kap this time with 145, and Stern-
feld led AEPhl with 116.

Locked Experience

AEPHI had good material in this
match, but lacked the experience
and control of the Gamma Kap
five. This advantage is obvious in
the scores, which show that no one
on the Gamma Kap team bowled
below 103 in either game. Gamma
Kap is holding its own in the race
for the cup this year, but AEPhi
may come out from under as the
team gains experience.

KID-Pierce

KD also topped Pierce in the first
two games of the match, thus elim-
inating the need of a third set. This
game prov.ded greater excitement
because the teams were more even-
ly matched, but neither group equal-
ed the quality of Gamma Kap's
play.

Alverson headed the winning KD
group with a total of 136 pins, al-
though her score was topped by
Rollema, who rolled up 156 for
Pierce. Ginny Anderson of the dorm
team also made a good showing with
a score of 133. The first game end-
ed 558-522, giving KD a lead of 36.
High Scores

KD honors in the second contest
went to Elgie, with 127. and Shoup,
who bowled 122. Ardito scored
high for Pierce with 138, but the
teams lost this game also.

KD gained the second victory by
a narrow margin of 16 points and
the game ended 544-528.

In both games the highest indivi-
dual score was rolled up by a mem-
ber of the Pierce Hall team, but the
more consistent rolling of the KB

 

 

Spam Siaff, (.90qu Teams
Depleted By Mild Epidemic

The gym is quiet and desolate.
It’s Tuesday .night and not
even a speck of activity. Wait a
minute—there's something go-

ing on in the middle of the .

floor. It’s not the State kids,
but a meeting of the mice who
inhabit the gym. Something is
wrong There’s no basketball
practice. Where’s Sweeney?
Where’s the basketball teams?
Where are the basketballs?

It really isn’t too difficult to
come to a conclusion. It seems
that eyeryone in school has the
flu, grippe, a bad cold or a bad
case of pre-vacation slump.
Anyhow, it all ties in. Sweeney
and several team members have
the flue—consequently there is
no basketball schedule or story.
This leaves the Sports Staff
minus not only personnel but
minus writeable material. How
can anybody write about what
isn’t?

Have a nice vacation everyone,
and here’s hoping the flu won’t
get you, tool

Fencing Practice

Celena Axelrod, ’47, Captain of
Fencing, has announced that the
first fencing practice of the year
will be held tomorrow morning from
ten o’clock until noon in the gym.
Since an instructor has not yet
been secured, Miss Axelrod, one of
State's most capable fencers and
last year's captain, will teach the
group for the first meeting.

Approximately eighteen girls
have signed up thus far. The sign-
up sheet is still posted on the WAA
bulletin board, and additional per-
sons may still join the group by
signing up before tomorrow.

WAA credit will be given to those
who complete ten hours of work in
the course and who have shown in-
terest and willingness to work.

In fencing, WAA is offering a
chance to take part in a healthful,
poise-building sport. Chuck has
urged that more girls come and take
advantage of the opportunity of-
fered.

It is hoped that more interest will
be shown in fencing this year than
has been taken in the past. If all
who sign up come out to practices.
this is insured.

By PAULA ‘TICHY

“When the boys come home"—-the
Sports Sn00p has been hearing this
for the past few Weeks in connec-
tion with MAA sports and its pro-
gram, and that‘s the reason for this
week’s question: “How can MAA de-
velop a pregram that will create
more enthusiasm for men’s sports?”

MAA’s activities have long been
a topic of d.scussion but the return
of veterans to the campus seems to
be bringing everything to a head.
The long and varied answers prove
that there is a lot of interest if it
can only be stimulated.

Jim Crandall, ’46—"I’d make an
obligatory mens gym class and this
class is to cons;st of calesthenics. If
they don't want to go to their as-
Signed gym class, they’d have to
participate in a certain amount of
extra-curricular sports equal to the
number of hours scheduled for gym.

“Secondly, if this is not possible
don't kill what sports activity we
have even tho’ it be in an em—
bryo stage, by canceling previously
scheduled use of athletic fields and
gym. The most avid male sports
fans will not continue their inter-
est long if after wa.ting till 4:30 to
use the Milne field they are told
that the field will be used for some
other event. The policy described
above has cost us the services of
Frank Woodworth. who was per-
haps the best potential MAA presi-
dent that wartime State has had.
Let’s make up our minds as to
whether or not we desire men’s ath-
letics and if so in the future to
cease the halfhearted sabotage
which has heretofore been the fate
of MAA.”

Paul Wagner, ’48—“Start off with
some sports that aren’t too highly
specialized so that the fellows who
haven't played them too much
won‘t feel inferior."

Jack Tabner, ‘49—“Better organ-
izat.on and more support. MAA
ought to get some concrete plans—
get going now so when the veterans
come b..ck in January they'll have
an organization to start a team
w.th."

Rchrrt Sullivan, 't16——“In the first
place you must have more men,
then more money."

Frank Woodworth, ’47 — “There
are roughly 90 guys enrolled in
State College including a dozen
grad students. There are probably
25 fellows interested, or vaguely in-
terested, in athlet.cs. Because of
abnormal conditions this figure is
not low. Also, athletically minded
men do not come to State because
the college has never been able to
offer an athletic program to com-
pare to other colleges and univer—
sities. In the past State was con-
sidered to be primarin a school for

 

teacher training. and athletics, al- .

though encouraged to some extent.
were secondary in importance.
Therefore, few good athletes came
to State.

“I believe that athletes will re-
turn in strength to State only after
the new gym is built. There is a
long standing controversy over the
use of the present gym. During the
day and evening both Milne and
State have to share the same small
gym. which is too small and inade-
quate for the college alone."

Clyde Cook, ‘47—-——"Tlie interest has
got to come from the fellows. Inter-
elass rivalry, a men's coach. and
gym classes would help get things
started."

Incson, Jones Winners

In First Round Matches

WAA swings into the lime light
this week with the beginning of the
ping-pong tournamentu It has at-
tracted an unusually large number
of participants this year. Forty-
three people have signed up so far,
thus equalizing the enthusiasm
shown for the MAA bouts.

Bertha Wakin, ’47, captain of
ping-pong, has announced that all
first matches must be played off by
December 18, or else both players
will be automatically eliminated.
This is very important, because the
matches must be played off quickly
and on schedule if rivalry splint and
present enthusiasm is to be kept up.
Two Matches Played

To date two matches have been
played off in the first round. Con-
sidering the number of people who
have signed up this is not a very
good percentage. (There are only
three more playing days until
Christmas vacation!) Jean Ineson
beat Mary Seymour in the first
game of the season.

Ineson showed unusual prowess
for a freshman, and is another of
the many unknowns who may be in
the race for the title. Mary Alice
Dines was defeated by Betty Jane
Jones in a very fast moving game.
For a while it looked as if it was
anybody's game, but Jones’ offen-
sive smash proved superior to Dines’
more steady defensive forehand
drive. The final scores were
Defends ’l‘iile

It is much too early to predict
winners, as the tournament has
hardly taken shape. However, the
interest of the freshmen cannot
help to reveal hidden skill. Ray
Weiss, last year’s champ, is a strong
contender for the title. Will she
retain it? Time alone will tell.

A suggestion for a Champ vs.
Chump game has been handed into
the staff. In such an arrangement
the losers would continue to play
the some as the winners. In the
final game the Champ would play
the person who had lost the most
number of games for the title.

 

Sandy Monro, ’49—“Have a large
and varied program so that every—
one can f'nd something they‘re in-
iercs.ed in."

Art Kaufman, '47—“The promise
of more men for State next semes-
ter w.li help get things started.
Once the "ball is rolling." I feel
that all the fellows will get behind
Ll.e movement 100%.”

Hal Webber, '47, newly elected
president of MAA, has this to say:
‘Right after Xmas, we’re going to
start a bowling league. In second
semester we‘re going to attempt to
get .nto an inter-city basketball
league with such teams as Sena,
Pharmacy, Albany Med. and Albany
Business College. There’s going to
be another ping-pong tournament
and a hi-lo doubles tournament.
We’re getting new ping-pong equip—
ment and MAA is going to subsidize
the bowling games.”
