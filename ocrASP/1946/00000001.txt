Sterling Brown
To Lecture Here

Friday, January 18
Noted Poet To Speak

On Negro Question

Sterling A. Brown, noted modern
American poet and a member of the
English faculty of Howard Univer-
sity, will be presented in Page Hall
at 8:15 P. M. on Friday, January 18,
by the Inter-Group Council and
Student Council of State College,
the Inter-Cultural League and the
Inter-Racial Council of Albany, and
the American Association of Uni-
versity Women.

This is the first community-col-
lege project to be attempted in sev-
eral years. It was brought about
largely through the efforts of the
Inter—Group Council of Albany and
of State College.

Depicts Negro Culture

Brown has presented in his writ-
ings the folkways of the American
Negro. Through his study of their
songs and way of life he depicts
their culture, which he considers an
important task in furthering under-
standing and appreciation of the
Negro.

In December, 1940, he spoke be-
fore another State College audience
which received him enthusiastically.
At this time, he stressed the danger
of stereotyping races or groups of
people such as the Negro. With Dr.
Louis C. Jones, Professor of English,
he recorded some of his folk songs
and poems which are now in the
college collection of recordings.
Lists Activities

Educated in Washington schools,
Brown later went to Willaims Col-
lege and Harvard University. He
taught at Virginia Seminary, Fisk
University, and Lincoln University
before going to Howard. He has
also been visiting lecturer at vari-
ous times at Vassar, New York Uni-
versity, and Atlanta University.
From 1936 to 1939, he ws the editor
on Negro affairs for the Federal
Writer’s Project.

Following this, he was a staff
member of Carnegie-Nyrdal.

Brown has written several books,
notably Southern Road, an attempt
at folk portraiture of Southern
characters, The Negro in American
Fiction, and Negro and American
Poetry... He was also editor of the
Negro Caravan, a collection of works
by Negro authors. In 1937, he was
awarded the Guggenheim Fellow-
ship for his achievements.

Admission is free to students and
the public.

 

The Student Union is one of the
newer additions to the campus of
Colgate University. State's Student
Union Board has contacted the Col—
gate group and received informa-
tion about the organization and
maintenance of the building there.

On October 23, 1923. the buildhig
was officially opened and dedicated
to James Colby Colgate. It was es-
pcsiully designed by the architect
Walter Chambers to be a second
home for the students with ample
space for recreational facilities and
on the third floor publication of-
fices, club rooms and enough wind-
lllg passage ways to give the place
an atmosphere. At the present time
the first floor is also used as quar-
ters for the i\' vy, Army and Marine
officers.

The dining room is the main part
of the Union for the most part, with
mailboxes, pool tables, soda foun-
tuin and lounge. Civilians may also
patronize the Union cafeteria. Play-
ing a vital purl. is the Student
Lounge, where students may relax
after meals to thcir favorite swoon
crooner Vlii records or listen to their
local talent,

Paradoxical Results Discovered D 8t A 

As News Board Interprets Poll

Paradoxical results are confusing,
but statistics in black and white are
more reliable than suppositions.
Operating on this assumption, the
State College News sponsored a poll
on Myskania—a poll that consider-
ed every major controversial point.
The results are revealing—though
occasionally contradictory. The
questionnaires were tabulated by
the editorial staff of the News
Board; the following interpretation
is given by the News Board.

The answers to Question 1 are
self—explanatory. Question 2 is en-
lightening in many ways. It is ob-
vious that the large majority of
students do not feel that Myskania
has too much power. Those who
do base their answers on several
diff‘erent points. Fifty-five students
feel that the organization has too
much power for a self-perpetuating
group; 23 feel the excess power lies
in their power to interpret the con-
stitution; 12 in handling elections;
16 because thcy have a secret con-
stitution; and 12 think that Stu-
dent Counc.l should handle some of
the dutics 01' Myskania. Censui‘e
was handed to the organization in
this question for being too influen—
tial, for wearing robes, for exercis—
ing jud.c.al power. for using implied
powers, and for being too influential
with Student Association. Each of
the aboxe merited one to five votes
each.

State ViewsStudent Union At

"Do you think Myskania is the
best-qualified student organization
to handle its various powers" was
anSWered in all cases by a majority
vote in the affirmative. Two of the
duties, however, were closely disput-
ed. Myskania was approved as the
best-qualified student organization
to handle student-faculty relations
by a vote of 416 to 370. This duty
is not legally delegated to any or-
ganization at present. Myskania
has been in charge of this phase
of student life for approximately
th.rty years . . . it was created in
1917 for this purpose. and since then
has enfinued its practice, author-
ized by tradition. Student Council
has begun to take a minor part in
this field in the. last year or two.
The other power or duty disputed
was that of constitutional inter-
pretation. This was approved in
favor of Myskania by 366 to 322, a
small majority of 44 votes. This
power, too, has been constitution-
ally granted to Myskania since the
institution of student government
in this college. It is possible to in—
terpret this particular result as an
effect of the motion of censure dis-
cussed in the fall of 1945 and di—
rected against Myskania's inter-
pretation of the Constitution in re-
gard to the Student Board of Fin-
ance election.

Question 4, "Are you in favor of
the present system of choosing Mys—
Rania?" was answered rather em—
phatically in the negative. Opposed
to the 252 who are in favor of the
present system, there are 415 stu-
dents who disapprove of it. The
plans suggested by the students who
disapprove of the present systems
were numerous. Straight popular
Lls'ction topped all other suggestions
“1.11 1125 votes cast in its favor; sec-
LllCl ecst-liked plan was that of
selection plus election as printed in
the State College News the issue
before Christmas recess and pre-
sented the Wednesday before that
by Gerhardt Weinberg and Philip
Lishinsky. Other plans with a
scattering of one to five votes cred—
ited each were Faculty Board selec-
tion; Jtiiiior Class election; Senior
Cl.iss election; automatic election 01'

leudci's of definite organizations;
popular election with faculty ap-

Veterans’ Troupe Praised

For Rhoads’ Entertainment

The veterans’ troupe show
may well be proud of the part
it took in entertaining the vet-
erans of the Rhoads General
Hospital last Friday evening.
Evelyn Jennings, Head Recrea-
tional Worker at the hospital,
has written the following in a
letter of appreciation to the
group:

"Will you please convey our
thanks to the members of the
Albany State College Troupe for
the wonderful entertainment
which you brought to the pa-
tients of Rhoads General Hos-
pital last evening.

“Your group has a great deal
of talent and they offered
enough variety to keep their GI
audience well engrossed. We can
assure you that this is an art
in itself.

"Sometime before too long,
we hope that you will return to
the hospital and bring them
some more pleasant diversion.”

Orchids to the entire troupe
for a good job well done.

To Give Lecture

On Mexican Lite
Varied Talk To Include

Colored Illustrations

Oi Culture Customs

Marie Liebl, '46, President of
Dramatics and Arts Council, has
announced that Betty Gatchell,
traveler and lecturer, will be pre-
sented in Page Hall tonight at 8:30
P. M. She will give an illustrated
lexture on Mexico.

Miss Gatchell has traveled in
Mexico for two summers, where she
studied the art and custom of the
Mexican people. Because of her
successful interpretation of Mexi-
can ways of life, she was sent to
Mexico City last summer by an or-
ganization called Experiment In
Mexico, a group interested in pro-
moting good relations between Mex-
ico and the United States.

Miss Gatchell is interested in not
only the ancient and modern paint-
ing, sculpture and architecture of
Mexico, but in the historical and
geographical backgrounds of culture
which have formed a basis for the
art of this people. She is an en-
thusiastic student of the Spanish
language and of modern Spanish
music. Both amateur artists and
photographers will be interested in
the slides which accompany her
lecture. since the art objects are
well chosen and the photography
the result of years of experimenta-
tion.

A graduate of Wellesley and the
University of Michigan, Miss Gat-
chell has also studied painting un-
der well-known artists in New York,
Florence and Mexico City. During
one summer of her study abroad
she was in charge of Miss Child’s
School for Girls in Florence, Italy.
Teaches Art

At present she is a teacher of
art at Miss Hall's School in Pitts-
field, where she has done much to
correlate the study of painting with
cosfuining and stage design. Among
her experiments in tempera, a me-
dluin which appeals to her very
much. is a school seal whiclrshe
designed for the Lenox School in
Lcnox. Massachusetts.

The lecture which Miss Gatchell
will give at State College has been
presented to various groups in the
vicinity of Plttsfield, in New York
City. and at Williams College.

Tickets can be obtained at the
Van Curler Music store for $.60.
Students may be admitted by Stu-
dent Tax.
