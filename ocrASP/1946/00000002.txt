Facts And Effects

A few weeks ago State sponsored an Intergroup 

Conference with representatives from the eleven
Teachers Colleges of the State. We have been
curious to know just exactly what, if anything, was
accomplished. An editorial in the Buffalo State
newspaper was gratifying. The editorial appeared
after Dr. Jones gave a talk there on inter-group

relations. At the time there was a serious contro— ]

versy resulting from the prohibition by the admin-
istration on the advice of a student committee of
the presentation of Negro minstrel show.

The editorial pointed out the fact that “There
is almost no such production which portrays an
intelligent, educated negro.” This is true and often
the cause of much unwarranted prejudice since
the faulty characteristics are largely exaggerated to
make the show laughable. it is the same in any
sort of folk presentation, but not to such an extent.

It goes on to say that, “No label of religion,
nationality, economic status or political affiliation
tells very much about the individual. The label
tends only to make us judge ‘the group as a whole’
as if it. were an organic being. “The gi'oupﬂany
group——as a whole’ is non—existant. inevitably,
each group is comprised of many individuals, each
in some ways different from all the others.

“Because of this, we must judge individuals on
their own merits, not as members of a group. in
doing this, we have no right to feel that we are
‘being nice’ to any group or that we are ‘granting
equality to inferiors.’ 'Squality cannot be granted;
it can only be recognized. Any equality that car-
ries with it a sense of condescension is false. Equal-
ity that is given with too self-conscious a nobility
is equally false and dangerous.”

This editorial presents what we believe to be
the whole purpose of an organization interested in
inter-group relations. it does not call for an aban-
donment of your own religious and political beliefs:
but rather a complete understamling of the indi-
vidual. Until that understanding is present in each
of us, we have no place in any high school in Amer-
ica.

inter-group Council owcs itself a put on the hack
for conducting the conference and trying to promote
inter-group cooperation in Statc and other colleges.
Buffalo is among those Colleges who have sci, up
lntergroup committees since thc confcrcncc.

Crime Wave

We have uscd various cxcuscs for our actions
here at State for the past fcw yours. 'i‘hcrt- is no
excuse, howcvcr for smiling. \\'c rcuiizc that no
one at State is exactly wcii-lo-tlw Inn that in itsclf
should prevent anyone from taking from another.
We seem to have had a rcguiar crimc wavc at State
this year. As much as forty dollars has hccn stoicn
from a single person forty dollars which was in-
tended for room and board or books. 'i‘hc lint-st
that has come to our cars is tin~ thcfl of twenty—
five dollars from a wallet. illt‘ltltilllly, that twcnty-
five dollars was saved from hard Work at tWo or
three after-school jobs. ()or scholastic standards
are high. Let‘s not let our moral standards plunge!

Before we fade into the background temporar-
ily while the spot seeks out a new iegree,_we would
like to catch up on a few gripes and suggestions
ignored thus far for lack of space or a prolific
pencil.

' We have staring us in our bebagged and smiling
faces, a new semester. The interested ones are
bulging with resolutions and revolutions. How-

' ever, we do not expect anything Spectacular until

the smoldering haze of that old tradition—exam-
inations, has passed and we can drag our sooty
selves back into the fire. There’s no need for luck-
wishing since the results will depend on how much
you have done in the past semester or on how much
you can squeeze into how small a space in how
small a time.

First, there‘s the matter of the Class of ’46—the
Grand Old Seniors who took the saying to heart
and walk around with canes and wrinkled faces. We
hope the second semester can miraculously inject
some of the old vitamins so we can manage to
stumble to the stage for our diplomas. Other classes
have lived through it and we didn’t expect the
frisky forty-sixers to die from a sudden stroke. We
had it and lost it.

Then there's the item of the freshman and
Sophomore classes. From their vague expressions,
and passive attitudes, you'd never guess rivalry ex—
isted. From the number of warnings that appeared
in November, we don't believe it is because State is
gong strictly scholastic.

Maybe we're expecting too much, but it doesn’t
seem that this year: more than the past three years,
should be such a (lull one. Certainly, there is more
social life. Aside from a few heated assemblies

- there has been very little enthusiasm demonstrated

about anything. From where we sit, the past semes-
tcr has showed little progress, except perhaps in in-

_ , tcr~group relations in which only a few are active-

Speaking of assemblies, next semester will be
an important one. The new constitution and the
budget, both of which will require a lot of intelli—
gcnt discussion and thinking, will be brought up.
if everyone makes a point of knowing a little about
what‘s going on, before voting, maybe next year
will not be darkened by foolish questions and ob-
scure objections. You already know You should
attend cvcry assembly and you may as well be~
causc some unpleasant steps will probably be taken
if you don't. After a while, the voices of author-
ity rcschi being taken lightly. Assemblies make
more sense to those who attend more than every

_ knowicdgc of the matter at hand. Before anyone

takc it upon himself to spout on democratic prin-
ciplcs or constitutional rights, may we suggest he
take somc consideration of the words of experienced

STATI COLLIGI NEWS. FRIDAY. JANLlARY H. 1946

Albany Council Nelson To Speak Editor Terms "Lest Weekend”
To Direct Local To Student Body Progressive Step in Film History

Housing Plans

The Albany Consumer’s Council
will sponsor a series of public lec-
tures and panel discussions con-
cerning the Albany housing prob-
lem. Dr. Richard H. Hill, Head of
the Research and Statistics section
of the New York State Division of
Housing, will speak at. the first
meeting on Tuesday at. 8:15 P. M.
in the Joseph Henry Memorial on
the topic “The State's Part, in
Housing.”

Explain Purpose

The general purpose of these
meetings is to interest the citizens
of Albany in working with the local
government. in forming a Public
Housing Authority for the city.
This body would work with the
State Housing Commission to ob-
tain aid from the State's Legisla-
ture or Federal government. for
housing projects. Albany and Roch-
ester are the only major cities in
the state which do not. have an or-
ganization of this kind.

Students Participate

The students in the Social Sci-
ence classes of Russell Sage College
and Oswego State Teacher’s Col-
lege made surveys in their commu-
nities to help in projects of this
sort. Dr. Theodore Standing, Pro—
fessor of Economics and Sociology
and chairman of the Albany Con—
sumer's Council, has suggested that.
the same plan may be used here. as
the local housing problem directly
affects State students.

Miss Alice Kirkpatrick, Assistant
College Librarian, has announced
that, material which pertains to this
problem has been posted on the
bulletin board in the library.

Two more meetings will be held
on January 28 and February 4 in
the YMCA. Little Theatre at. 8:15
P. M. The topics to be discussed
are “Slum Clearance and Public
Housing" and “Middle-Priced Hous-
ing." The speakers for these meet-
ings will be announced at a later
date.

In his “Address to the Nation”
broadcast on January 4, President
Truman stressed the enormous im—
portance of public housing and slum
clearance programs throughout the
nation, and indicated that each
citizen of a community must do his
part.

On Shrivenham

Dr. Milton G. Nelson, Dean of the
college, who recently returned from a
leave of absence in England, will ad-
dress the assembly this mornnig. The
next. assembly program on January
18 will consist of a musical program
under the direction of Dr. Charles
F. Stokes, Profesmr of Music. Stu-
dent Council is also making plans
to present the newly-revised Con-
stitution to Student Association in
a series of assemblies early next
semester.

To Speak on Experiences

Dean Nelson, who has been serv-
ing as an instructor in Shrivenham
University, an American school for
Army personnel in England, will
discuss his experiences teaching
American GI’s there. Dean Nelson
and Dr. Harry W. Hastings, Pro-
fessor of English, were asked to
serve on the University faculty last
June and have been doing so until
last, month when the University
closed since it. was no longer need-
ed. In his address Dean Nelson will
attempt to explain the Army Educa-
tion program and its methods of
instruction. A financial report will
also be made by a member of the
Student Union Board in order to
inform the student body of the pro-
gress which has been made by this
group.

Student Council

At a meeting of Strident Council
Wednesday night plans were made
for an open meeting of this body
which will be held early next sein-
ester. At this meeting the prob-
lems of the returning veterans at
State will be discussed and the pos-
sibility of establishing a Student
Loan Fund will be debated. Stu-
dent Council is also making plans to
present the newly-revised Constitu-
tion before Student. Association
during next semester. At, this time

Having spent the last five months
trying to wake up State and inci-
dently ourselves. we thought before
the first. semester crawls into sec-
ond, before GE. sends us back to
gas, 01' Tommy Manvillc takes his
ninth wife. and before the old atom
bomb puts an end to everything,
we'd like to take inventory of the
future.

Student Association meetings
seem to be dribbling along in placid
unconccrn doing their extraordinary
jobs in an ordinary way, except. for
a few of its leaders who seem to be
leading us all by the nose. Have
you noticed that the problems given
the most time in assembly are prob-
lems between clashing personalities
and not problems of the student
body. If, for example. more time
had been devoted to dealing with
the concrete problems of' Myskuniu.
instead of burdcnlng the assembly
schedule with more tcchnical forms
of censure and counter-censure. pcr-
hups student. government problems
would be nearer solution at this
time. Let‘s hope that. when the
new Constitution comes before us
in second semester. students will
weigh the importance of‘ the vari—
ons points and leave insignificant
billllllillg for thc Commons, Lounge,
and P. 0.

Talking about the P. O. let’s see
how the Nows is making out«uftcr
oil it is one ot' the most potent
forces in influencing student opin-
ion. Despite its diminishing stuff.
tin: Nows is still up—to—tin'nminutc
in the latest. developments. By the
way » pour-quot the diminishing?
People do not. sumo to realize thc
untold amount of time and effort
required for a first class college
newspaper.

Many people are forced to give up
this activity because of burdensome
and difficult schedules —- others,

 

particularly the freshmen, indicate
lack of interest—as is evident from
the comparison of the number of
frosh who were with the News in
September, and those who are still
faithful to the old grind. We cer-
tainly have 49‘ers capable of main-
taining the high standards set. for
academic subjects plus those set by
News Board policies. Where are
those frosh?

One of the hardest hit. war casu-
alties, Advanced Dramatlcs, has
been smoldering from lack of Dr.
Hardy—yet drama has been more
than kept alive by another new 01‘-
gnnizatmn, College Playhouse. Here
again we find students sacrificing
other interests and devoting huge
amounts of' time keeping the cur-
tuln raised in Page Hall.

All in all we've had a fairly suc-
cessful semester. A great deal has
been done but there is a great deal
more to do. So let's not rest on our

lanrcls but plunge into the new
semester with bigger and better
ideas and objectives.

Taking a hint from this. your

cohunnists feel they should join the

masses who annually cultivate new

aspirations and resolutions for the
bcticrmcnt. of themselves and man-
kind. in plain wordsMWc need an
overhauling too.

Resolution:

1. We rcsoh'c to always got the col-
umn in on Tuesday night to re-
iicvo the frantic fronzics ot' Hug-
crty and 'l‘cssicl'.

13. Wt‘ resoch not to dismember the

bodics of those who criticize our

column.

Scriousiy. we resolve to make this

column more conducive to under-

standing State's role as compar—
ed with other colleges.

NOTE: Any or all of these resolu-
tions may be broken in the near
future.

“I’i never take another drink as
long as I llvel" (or/and) “I'm head-
ing for the nearest bar!"

It. all began when my venerable
colleague in combat, O’Neil, receiv-
ed a double pass from Ray Milland
for the premier of “Lost. Weekend"
in the Delaware Theater last Friday
afternoon. The atmosphere was
perfect — a dark theater, a small
number of people scattered about
among empty seats. The projector
began to hum (1naudlbly)—the first
scene flashed on the screen . . .

"Lost. Weekend,” 9. new step in
the development of the motion pic-
ture, features Ray Mllland and Jane
Wyman in two of the most. dram-
atic roles in cinema history. Mill-
and did a beautiful job of dramatic
acting. He neither over-played nor
under-played the numerous highly
emotional scenes. The photography
reached an all-time high, in my
opinion. in such scenes as the one
featuring the battle between the
bat. and the mouse, and the close,
almost still, shot of the eyeball of
Mllland. Both scenes imparted a
contagious terror and fear to the
scarcely breathing audience. Direc-
tion was more than adequately clone
——lt changed from a mere craft. to
a fine art.

“Lost Weekend" is the story of a
would-be writer who gave up his
typewriter for liquor. Don Birnam,
swears that he has a double per-
sonality—Don Birnam, the author,
and Don Birnam, the drunk. When
he began writing in his youth, he
had talent, personality, imagination.
But like all young writers, he was
dissatisfied with his first, literary
creations. Discouragement followed
dissatisfaction, and despair follow-
ed discouragement. At. length.
tired, without money, and defeated,
he turned to liquor, that double-
faced hypocrite of hope.

Drinking. the easiest habit to de-
velop. the hardest to conquer, soon
overwhelmed his personality, his
will. his talent. himself. He pro-
gressed from bad to worse. Before
long, he was forced to accept board
and room from his brothel“, and so-

lace and comforting words from his
sweetheart. The combined efforts
of the two were not successful in
coping with his first love, "liquor.

One day he is picked up and
taken to an alcoholic ward. The
scenes shot. in the alcoholic ward
show patients in the grip of dell-
rium tremors —— the proverbial
“DT’s”. The doctor talks to Don—-
"It isn't pink elephants you see.
It’s the little animals—tiny tur-
keys and insects. It‘s the little ani-
mals. One man I know saw beetles
— beetles all over him — beetles
crawling all about him. But they
only come at. night—in the dark—
remember, that, Don Bfrnam. They
only come at night.” (Quote not.
guaranteed to be accurate.)

Don Birnam escapes from the al-
coholic ward, and after much wan—
dering about, finds his way back to
his room. He locks himself in with
txvo bottles of rye to keep him com-
pany. The night. comes on —— the
liquor is gone. Don Blrnam hears
a weird, squeeklng noise. He sees
a mouse on the wall. Then bats be-
g.n to fly about-tliey swoop down
over his head—hover above him——
encircle him with terror.

The bat. plunges upon the mouse
and a tiny trickle of blood seeps
down the wall.

Jane Wyman enters as Don's
sweetheart, gives him black coffee,
and forces him to bed. In the morn-
ing, she awakens to find him gone
—her leopard coat is also missing.
A quick trip to the pawn shop re-
veals that Don has exchanged the
leopard coat. for a pistol. The girl
remembers that he had once men«
tioned his desire to end his life.
Panic-stricken. she races to his
apartment.

The ending? We’ll pass over that.

"Lost Weekend" is a tremendous
story, and it is filmed with great
accuracy and realism. It, has al-
ready received several awards for
the acting. the directing, and the
photography.

There are, perhaps. two points of
criticism which may be mentioned.
The ending is weak in comparison
to the rest of the story. It. falls
from brutal realism to a melodram-
atic emotional farce, which to the
over-wrought spectators seems on-
real and fictitious.

The other criticism is one I set
forth in conjunction with far great-
er critics. It. is the height of cruel-
ty to force to audience to sit. for two
solid hours in a dark theater (dry)
while the leading character finishes
one drink after another. The rye
flows like water: throats grow
parched and over-tensed mlncis
yearn for comfort. in good night’s
sleep. of course!)

All in all, however. it is a five-
star picture—an ace among aces—
a splendid beginning for the career
of the cinema in 1946. Hats off and
orchids to the actors. the director,
the photo: ‘aphel‘. and the author.
