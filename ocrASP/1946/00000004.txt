And so begins another year . . .
We have been snooping around try-
ing to see if anyone has made any
New Year’s resolutions and surpris-
ineg enough a few people have. We
were talking to one person today
who told us a story of the thin per-
son and the plump person who go
around together. The reason for
this is that each of them keeps the
other from doing the things they
really shouldn't do anyway. To ex-
plain — this is in reality a small
scale “health”? program in which
“thinnie” keeps “plumpie” from eat-
ing more than one helping of des-
sert, candy, etc. Plumpie recipro-
cates by making thinnie wear her
glasses (she has bad eyes because of
Vitamin deficiency) eat more, take
her “Be Built Up Quick The Easy
Way" pills and many other things.
This is really something to watch—
probably in eight or ten weeks thin-
nie will be plump and plumpie will
be thin, if so we’ll let you know. As
for any other resolutions, as far as
we have been able to find out, most
of them have been broken already.
Tsk, tsk and we’ve only been back
one week.

No Snow

Well, last year at this time, WAA
was planning a sleigh-ride. Almost
everyone around here knOWS that in
order to have a sleigh-ride—that is
successful at least, there must be
snow. Right about now the only
thing we could have is a mud ride
with atmosphere lent by rain and
sleet. It has been suggested as a
possible reason for the weather con-
ditions as they are now, that a sea-
son reversal may be in process. Pic-
ture WAA notices going up in June
to the effect that skating and sled-
ding will be held on Wednesday and
Friday and softball notices going up
in December. Well, we all like a
little change now and then.

Basketball Stars

The basketball play-offs have fin-
ally started and from the games so
far, it looks like another good sea-
son. The only drawback this season
is that this is the last issue of the
News for this semester and therefore
We will not be able to report on any
of the games played tomorrow or
next week. Many of the most im-
portant games will probably be play-
ed then and therefore not as much
publicity will be given to the bas-
ketball season this year as was given
last year. Also a gripe we would like
to mention concerns the scorekeeper
who is actually considered a member
of the team. If the person on the
team is to be given WAA credit for
keeping scores, it seems only logical
that the score should be kept cor-
rectly. In several instances last year
the total individual scores did not
tally with the team score, and so
when any question arose as to in-
dividual scores some kind of a guess
had to be made. This guessing could
be eliminated if the scores were
kept correctly -- so how about it
scorekeepers let’s get on the ball!

Some Apologies

A few weeks ago we mentioned the
sadist around the PD. who went
around putting spiders down our
back. Well things are getting worse
instead of better~—~—seems as though
these people are better athletes than
we are and now their favorite pus-
tlmes are picking us up and throw
ing us on the floor——just for fun of
course. We also hear along this line
that this sudist’s father noticed the
previous little item and knew right
away that it was his daughter. Well,
we really didn't l‘ueuu to get this
dear person into trouble but if it
helps to discourage the commando
tactics that are resulting in our
gradual physical breakdown—then
hurrah!

Of First Round

The first round of the WAA ping
pong tournament neared completion
this week as several more of the
games were played off.

As now stands, thirteen games
have been completed. The winners
include Ineson, who defeated Sey-
mour, Hollis defeating Callahan,
Dunn over Hilt, Jones defeating
Diner, Standish over A. Zeilengold,
Tilden over Sweeney, SOWa defeat-
ing Simon, Connors winning from
Iorio, Fisher over Hellman, Midgley
defeating Melewicz, Fisher over Gil-
ver, and Fenenboch winning from
Steinbach. Weiss drew a by to en-
ter the second round without meet-
ing competition.

Among the close games which
marked the first round were those
played by Dunn and Hilt. Dunn
came out on top by winning the
first two games although the com-
petition was extremely stiff. B. J.
Jones recovered after losing the
first of three games to Mary Alice
Diner. The two which followed
were hotly contested but Jones
came through as victor. Taking
easy victories were Alice Fisher, who
won with no effort from Nancy
Hellman, and Ray Weiss, who de-
feated Judy Fenenboch, 21-5 and
21-6.

The game betWeen Fenenboch
and Weiss marked the opening of
the second round. Fenenboch is
therefore eliminated from the com-
petition.

Four more rounds must be com-
pleted before the ping pong cham-
pion is selected. In the second
round, five winners will be chosen.
The third round will narrow this
number to three. Two contestants
will be left at the completion of the
fourth round with just one more
round needed to determine the
tournament champion.

Several games in the first round
have not yet been completed. Un-
less these games are played off in
the near future, both contestants
will be automatically eliminated.

 

Tilden Announces
Classes Started

A new class is beginning and ad-
vanced swimming will start this Fri-
day, January 11, from 3:30 to 5
o'clock and will be held every Tues-
day and Friday afternoons there-
after in Public Bath Number 3.

Patricia Tilden, ’48, captain, an—
nounced that fifteen members have
already signed up for the class. A
sign up sheet has been placed on the
WAA bulletin board for anyone iii-
tcrcstcd. Although most of the peo-
ple who have signed up want to
learn to swim, others who just want
to come for recreation are invited to
attend these classes. It has been
suggested that all who plan to at-
tend wear bathing caps. WAA credit
will be given to those who come to
the class ten times.

RAH! RAH! RAH!
TEAM TEAM TEAM!

Such were the sounds that at-
tracted the Sport Snoop to the
depths 0i Richardson. It wasn’t the
same as last year. We couldn't help
out nouee, so we inquired about the
change. it would seem a new has-
ketball system has been initiated.
Thus the origin or this week's ques-
tion: "What do you think of the new
baSketball system, and why do you
think it is more efficient than last
years?” (The following opinions are
from those in the know." The sys-
tem is explained through the an-
swers.)

baker, ’47: because of the shorter
playing tune, iour minute quarters,
more games can be played off in
one night. lnscead of last years two
and three games, four are played
011 in the same amount of time. A
team losmg three out or four games
is automatically out or the league.
'Il'ilS makes the season less drawn
out, and a steady interest is main-
tained in the games rather than in-
terest in the iinals only. It is only
logical that the more teams elim-
inated, the better teams are left and
the games are more exciting
throughout.

Quinn: With 325 games to be
played off in 13 weeks, something
had to be done. There just wasn't
enough playing time that could be
scheduled. It was ridiculous for a
team in first place to be playing
a team at the bottom near the end
of the season. There Just wasn’t
interest in these games. With the
new elimination system, there is
more incentive to stay in the league,
and the games build up to a climax
from beginning to end.

 

Sweeney: Sickness has already
done more than its share to hold up
the basketball schedule. What we
want most is to get the games off
on schedule and end the season be-
fore it has a chance to drag. Sat—
urday is to be kept open for prac-
tice, and to give those kids who want
to play and who are not on a team
a chance.

Now Basketball Sol-Upf

Efficiency WAA By-Word
, The new system for playing
on the basketball games is
a gain ui WAA efficiency. With
the elimmation of a team los-
ing three out or four games,
the league cannot drag like it
did last year. Basketball is of
major interest in State College,
it being the major winter sport
on campus. A long, drawn out
schedule over a period of years
would discourage the intense in-
terest at present. WAA must be
given credit for iorsight, and
thanks ior saving basketball at
State.

In order to get WAA credit
9. player must come out ten
times. What happens to the
players on the disqualified
teams? WAA again proves its
new efficiency. Saturdays are
left open for practice only. This
gives those disqualified a chance
to get WAA credit. Orchids to
WAA.

 

Fencing Clm
Toﬁc Continued

Celina Axelrod, ’47, captain of
fencing, announced that the last
class for this semester will be held
Saturday, January 12, at 10 o’clock,
in Page Hall gym. Classes will be-
gin again with the new semester.

Last Saturday, the class practiced
advancing, retreating and lunging;
all basic steps in fencing. The cor-
rect position of' the body and the
correct use of the foil were stressed.

Fencing as a recreational activity
is an excellent medium for combin-
ing training in grace and poise with
a wonderful time.

Basketball Results

(Continued from Page 6, 001. 2/
ness dropped two points each
through the hoop for BZ. Sittig
scored two points for Stokes as the
quarter ended.

Casey made two pushups, then
Baker and Maginis scored one
apiece making the score 14-2 in fa-
vor of BZ.

Joslin matched Baker’s two bas-
kets as the half began. Baker and
then Casey scored.

Maginess scored four points and
Casey pushed through the last bas-
ket to give BZ the game 27-6.

Psi Gam’s' team produced the
high-highest scorer of the week
when Lengyel scored 22 points. Their
defense was tight allowing Tommy
More to score only seven points. The
final score was 30-7 for the South
Lake team.

The Whiz Kids defeated AEPhi,
8-6 in the fastest game of the week.
AEPhi was ahead until the last
quarter when Ricci scored the two
deciding baskets.

In the last game of the evening,
Newman turned back the Sayles
squad, 13-4. Sayles put up a good
fight but Newman's trio of forwards
outpointed them.
