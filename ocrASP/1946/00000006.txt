Spirit Of Co-operation Predominates
In Presenting College Wide Dance

A whirl of skirts and a blur of dis-
charge buttons will fill the gym and
Lounge next Friday as State's six-
teen lending organizations unite for
the first college wide dance in re-
cent years.

Since February 22 in the date, cher-
ry trees and hatchets will predom-
inate in the theme for decorations,
with other patriotic trimmings con-
tributing to the Washington’s Birth-
day atmosphere.

Festivities will begin in the gym at
8:30 but it is expected that on over-
l'low crowd will bring the Lounge
into use.

A unified State will present a solid
backing for the dance. All of State's
lending organizations have joined
forces to make the affair a gala
event. There will be a friendly spirit
ol’ cu-opol‘utlon prevailing us mem-
bers of each organization work to-
gether to make the evening a suc-
cess. The work and the money are
being shouldered equally by all the
campus groups, since the executive
committee directing the event is made
up of two members representing each
of the organizations.

Fun through dancing will be the
idea of the evening as strains of

“Vic” music fill the Lounge and drift
up from the gym. There will be
periods of rest when a lull will pro-
vide a suitable opening for the pro-
gram of entertainment—a program
which has at its disposal the best of
the talents which State has to offer.

And weary and breathless from
energetic dancing, the guests will
gratefully accept the cooling cokes
which will be on hand.

State girls have eagerly awaited the
return 01’ proms and parties, and
now that normally is on its way back,
State’s leaders realize the vast unl-
l‘ying power of the war and are spon-
soring the dance in hopes of maln~
tilillillg the spirit of close co—opera-
tion. The staffs of the three college
publications, the religious clubs. Stu-
dent Council. Myskania, Inter-Group
Council, Press Bureau, Music Coun-
cil, the States-Men. Dranmtics and
Arts Council, Forum, Campus Com-
mission, ond Debate Council have all
pooled their time and efforts to make
the evening a success. The event is
being financed by a contribution of
three dollars from each organization,
which will be refunded from the
money taken in at the door. Admis-
sion will be $.25 per person.
