Basketball is ’baekvat State and we
‘ haves team thatweean brag about
to anyone! The .“s'etback that was
scored last Wednesday may have
been a Win for Siena. but’the State
fans saw just what they came to
' see — their team. putting up a real
fight against a team that had one
more thing in its favor—more time
for practice. If State had had more
time to work out their, plays and
practice as a . team. it would
have been a win. Since there is an-
other game coming up Thursday of
next week, and several more sched-
uled for the following weeks, how
about speeding up the WAA basket-
ballgames a little more to leave the
gym free for the team. The irregu-
lar practice hours are one of the
big disadvantages to the team. If
the team can get in a lot more time
for practicing and working out a few
more plays, then the return game
with 'Siena which is scheduled for
.March 6 may show the same squad
piling up the score over Siena's head.

Sports are beginning to mean a
more around State than they used to
—or‘_{ hadn't you noticed? It must be
that people are beginning to take
those vitamin capsules insteadof just.
looking at them. Well the shot in
the arm is certame helping to bring
out. alittle of. .the spirit that we
knew was. around here. anyway—it
was iust‘ hiding.

,‘Would you believe that we were
threatened right after the Myskania-'
Soph game, Wednesday night. Well
after the game, Berbri— oops sorry
we really not mention names, well
anywa , she dashed madly up and
said...._‘Remember—we beat the fresh
lastwecki Be sure to mention that!"
Well when we recovered from the

‘ shock... we merely, batted our eyei
lashes. and said that we would men-
tion. it. ,‘ So you see—that's how some
news gets into print!

.Put down that hatchet Ber----.
Washington’s birthday isn’t until
next week.

Sophomore Team
Trips Myskania
in Fast Game

The Sophomore team had its first
workout when they trounced the
hard fighting Myskania six in the
preliminary contest at Wednesday
nights State-Siena game. Winning
by the convincing score of 43-16, the
Sophomore team displayed a great
deal of skill on the court and proved
{Self a team that will be hard to

a . -

The Sophomores skyrocketed into
the lead in the first quarter when
the Myskania guards Were unable to
stop the fast pace set by Tilden,
Cooper, and Quinn, outstanding Soph
forwards. Leading 14-2 at the end
of the first period. the Sophomores
continued their onward advance
having netted a score of 24-4 when
the half mark was reached. The
second half found the plucky Mys-
kania basketecrs hard at work in a
vain attempt to gain aginst the
Sophs. It was Seymour that starred
here with placement shots from mid
court and Black, who did a great
deal of excellent passwork and cut-
ting. Howevor, it was the Sophs
game all the way as Tilden sank
shots from all parts of the court
aided by the excellent team work
which supported her. The final
score found it a Sophomore victory
as the scoreboard read 43-16.

The Myskania team beat the
Freshman basketeers 17-16 in a. hard
fought game on Friday. Howaver.
the Fresh proved that they have a
good deal of basketball material and
when they have had more practice.
will prove a challenge to the thus
far superior Sophomore team.

Still Undefeated

Sayles Bows To 32,-
Phi Deli, KD Also Win

On Monday afternoon, KD and
the Rares staged a fight all the".
In the beginning of the fourth quar-
ter the score was tied 13-13. Siackle
spurted ahead, leading her team (I
to a 23-14 victory. Although Siackie
served as the winning spark, 0'-
Grady's performance throughout the
game was outstanding.

In the second game, the Whiz Kids
defeated Chi Sig 13-9. The teams
were tied 4-4, until the third quart!
when the Whiz Kids took a ‘10-6 lead.
Daley was high scorer for the Whiz
Kids and Moberg played a notable de-
fensive game.

Phi Delt Wins

Tuesday night’s games got off to
a fast start when Phi Delt downed the
Powerful Psi Gam squad to the tune
of 13-19. It was a fairly close game
with Psi Gam rallying periodically
to keep the game interesting. There
were quite a number of fouls on both
sides. Lengyel, Collier, and O’Neil
made 4 points each for the loosers,
while Tilden paced the victors with 6.

Newman Loss

The most thrilling game of the
evening was the Gamma Kap-New-
man game. Gamma Kap had wm
every game they played, and New-
man had only one loss. However,
Newman was considered to be a heavy
contender for the title. Gamma Kap
opened the game when Young scored
twice in succession. It was fast mov-
ing all the way through, but from
the beginning it was Gamma Kap's
game. The Newman forwards could-
n't seem to get started. At the half
the score was 14-3 in favor of Gamma.
Kap. They kept piling up points
throughout the remainder of the
game, to win by a final score of 23-0.

The third game of the evening was
between Sayles and Bz. It was a slow
game for the most part with the nz
squad outplaying the Sayles six.

Baker starred for BZ and got in

some amazing shots. The final score
was 18-4.

 

Ping-Pong Till
Nears Final Play

The WAA Ping Pong Tournament
has reached the final stages of the
play offs. In games held this week.
Alice Fisher defeated H. Zcilengold,
B. J. Jones topped M. Hollis in a
highly contested game and Fran
Sowa won over Ad. Fisher.

With only two more games to be
played until the finals are reached.
predictions from all parts are being
received as to whom will become the
ultimate victor. Ray Weiss, last
year’s champ, seems to have the edge
over Fran Sowa although the game
will probably be one of the toughest
played games of the tournament.
In the other game which will put
Alice Fisher over B. J. Jones, a very
close game is expected with Fisher
having a slight advantage over Jones.
If Fisher should win her match and
Weiss wins. the game betWeen the
two should be filled with surprises
and a display of very good playing.
