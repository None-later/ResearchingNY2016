When we think of the basketball
games played by the WAA league
teams this year, the one thing that
stands out differentiating the games
from those played last year is the
lack of spirit with which these
games are carried through. Last
year, if we remember correctly,
other members of the houses came

along to cheer their teams along.
Some even had cheers and a cheer
leader. This year the spirit has
definitely died down. There are act-
ually only a few people who come
to see their teams play. We hope
to see more of a showing at the
final play-off of the two top teams.

Helpful Friends

Sports that various people are now
taking up are resulting in an en-
larged collection of skeletons for the
biology department. The skeletons
are mainly bat skeletons caught by
specialists in this line. In fact, the
specialist in the lead who has now
caught at least nine bats says,
"Well, if I fail practice teaching, I
will spend my life collecting bats
to further the cause of — — Well
there must be some cause it would
further!” This we thought was quite
an unselfish aspiration. At this
point may come the question of why
all this is happening now. Well the
reason is that something happened
to the thermostat so that the house
was warmer than usual. The bats
hibernating for the winter, notice
the sudden change in temperature
and‘thinking that it is spring, come
down and begin to fly about at dusk
—causing, as you may Well imagine,
no end of consternation to the dear
fenimes living at the house. Well.
after all, life would be dull if there
were not winged creatures around!

A Gripe

Seeing ihe head on this will prob-
ably cause a lot of people to skim
over but if only a few of the in-
volved people see it then we will be
happy. It's about the score books
again. Could we humbly request
that the scores be kept according to
the spaces and in the spaces that
are provided in the book and also
that a slight amount of energy be
used in pushing the pencil that is
used. Some of the scores are writ-
ten in so lightly that correct or not
wthey can't be read without the
aid of an arc lamp. The scores are
being kept much better than they
were last year so that's consolation
—pretty soon we ought to have per-
fect score books—Allah!

Then there's the story of Cinder-
ella and the glass slipper. The 1946
version is, however, somewhat dif-
ferent. Seems as though the mod-
ern Cinderella is a cute little blondc
with u lot of luck and a foot just
the right size to fit the slipper! We
were nil in the P. O. slaving away.
when we heard that one of our

STATE COLLEGE NEWS. FRIDAY. FEBRUARY 22. 1946

‘State To Meet ABC

Next Wednesday Night

Techniques Developed
From Added Practices

By the show of attendance at the

' two previous games, State is going

all out for MAA intercollegiate bas-
ketball. The men have worked
hard trying to put a winning team
on the floor and to put State in the
winning column.

The game last night with Albany
Law school, showed not only the
teamwork, but also the doggedness
characteristic of our team. Captain
Feeney showed his ability for lead-
ership and Mullen was excellent on
both defensive and offensive. An-
other of State's outstanding floor
men was Combs who intercepted
many a pass.

Red Evans, who was one of the
high scorers of the Siena game,
again showed his ability for tallying
points. Marsland and Bortnick
played their steady dependable
game throughout the entire contest.
Coming Games

Next Wednesday night, February
27, in Page Hall gym, these men
will take on the best Albany Busi-
ness College has to offer. ABC has
had an excellent team during the
past years and this year has one of
the fastest teams in the section.
State will have to play a hard game
to defeat this group.

There is a possibility that State
will have a return game with Siena
in the near future. Since this team
was the first one that the Purple
and Gold had ever played, there
are great hopes that State will come
forth a victor in the return match.

The game with the YMCA which
was to be played tomorrow night
has been cancelled. However, this
game is expected to be played soon.
The Y has a quintet of tail men but
with further practice State has an
excellent opportunity of setting
them back.

Other games will be scheduled if
these encounters will fit in our op-
ponent’s schedules.

MAA Plans
Ping-Pong Series

MAA’s second ping-pong tourna—
ment of the year has been started
this week. Both the singles and
doubles have been lined up and the
play-offs are now in progress.

In the MAA singles only one of
the ten scheduled games has been
played so far. This was the Palev-
sky-Sullivan match. Palevsky won
the first set 21-11 but Sullivan
quickly turned the tables, topping
Palevsky 21-12 and 21-19 in the
next two sets. As winner of this
game Sullivan Is listed to play the
victor of the Weiner-F‘eeney match
in which Weiner is the favorite.
Ping-Pong Doubles ’

Eight combinations have signed
up for the ping-pong doubles: Mc~
Carthy-Mincr vs. Kauman-Bohln-
sky, Wugncr-Oarr vs. Bolles-cher,
Mullin-Wcincr vs. Bortnick-Fccncy,
and Combs—l..ushinsky vs. Dickin-

servations of ihcir ability, the Kauf—

 

Ping-Pong Finals
Won By Weiss

For Second Year

On Tuesday afternoon, Ray Weiss,
’48, defeated Alice Fisher, ’48, in the
WAA ping-pong finals, taking two
straight games, 21-16 and 21-18.

From the beginning, Fisher play-
ed a defensive game. She usually
is very good on the offense and
probably would have had a better
chance to win if she had started
out on the defensive.

As a rule, a tricky server, Weiss’s
playing was not up to par on that
count. Whenever she volleyed the
bail to any point on the table, Fish-
er was adept at picking it up and
returning it.

Weiss’s steady gain was due to
her using heavy slams and slashing
the ball news the table. This has
also been a definite reason why she
has been the WAA ping-pong cham-
pion for two successive years.

Although many more signed up
only thirteen showed enough inter-
est and enthusiasm to actually play
in the tournament.

Weiss, being the odd number,
moved into the semi-finals after
playing only one game. Fisher had
three previous matches before en-
countering Weiss in the deciding
contest.

With the closing of this tourna-
ment, State has seen the last of the
WAA ping-pong competition for
this semester. From now on, the
spotlight will be directed towards
the second MAA tourney.

RIVLARY BASKETBALL

Rivalry spirit has been revived by
the basketball series. One game,
which was played last night, started
it off and another rivalry basketball
game has been scheduled for next
week. If neither class wins the two
games a third clash will be played.

Mickey Seaman, WAA manager of
‘49, has great hopes for her squad.
Even though the Fresh have come
from far seperated schools, they have
put in two weeks of intensive prac-
tice, under the watchful eye of Ba-
ker. ’47.

The Sophomore team. which is
captained for the second year by
Quinn, has the advantage in the
series because they have played to-
gether as a unit for the past two
years. With 'l‘ildcn, Quinn, and
Cooper or Maginncss in the forward
slots, and chhl, Diffin, and Troun-
ser or Shapiro in the guard posts
the class of ’48 has the height that
will count in the long run.

Smiling Swordsman Sees
Fencing Femmes Flutter Foils

Since last fall some of State's
femmes have been striving to de-
velop proficiency in one of the old-
est arts of defense. There was
something so romantic and chal;
lenging in the command, f‘Engarde
that ten little girls climbed out of
bed early Saturday morning.

Until last week every thing seem-
ed to proceed according to plan.
Form, balance, coordination and
footwork were uppermost in the
minds of the fencing enthusiasts.
Then, the new instructor appeared.
Joseph Messier of LaSalle is a skill-
ed swordsman with “curly brown
hair and twinkling blue eyes." It
isn't his fault that every time he
strides into view his charges become
so distracted they fumble and drop
their foils, but that’s the way it Is.
The new instructor has caused a
sensation. _

Honestly girls, you can’t have
your cake and eat it too! YOU con-
centrate on fencing.

Two Squad Top

Basket League

Phi Delt, Gamma Kap
Only Undefeated Team:

The WAA basketball leaguecon-
tinues this week as five more teams
played their games with several
others yet to be played-off. The
Wednesday night games were post-
poned and this slightly delayed the
games scheduled this week.

Two teams have been eliminated
from the league because of failure
to win at least one out of four
games. These are Wren and Com-
muters. AEPhi and Western have
dropped out of the running.

Four games were postponed this
week and will be played off in the
near future. The scheduled matches
were KD vs. Phi Delt, Psi Gam vs.
Rares, Tommy More vs. Sayles and
Moreland vs. Farrell. With the
completion of these four games the
second round of the basketball lea-
gue will come to an end. All teams
that have lost four games have been
eliminated from the league.

There are only three teams which
are undefeated so for. These are
Gamma Kap, Phi Delt, and Beta.
Zeta. KD and Psi Gam have only
been defeated once, indicating that
five strong teams will be fighting
hard as the tourney pulls into the
semi-finals.

Last Monday afternoon, the Rares
literally swamped Tommy More
with a score of 26-10. The game
didn’t really get going until after
the half when the Rares tightened
their defensive. From then on it
was their game. Davidson was high
scorer for the winners, and Herlihy
paced the loosers.

On Tuesday night the Newman-
BZ tilt took the spotlight. It was
a close game all the way to the fin-
ish. Up until the half, Newman
kept a two point edge over BZ. At
the half the score was tied 11-11.
In the third quarter the BZ squad

rallied when Casey started the ball .

rolling by tossing in a field goals
BZ managed to keep the lead from
then on. It was a hard fight but
BZ came out with a win of 18-13.
Casey was high scorer for the vic-
tors with a total of 11 points. Cooper
tossed in 5 for the defeated Newman
squad.

Gamma Kap chalked up another

win to their record of all wins by ‘
downing the Chi Sig team 30—10. The ‘

powerful Gamma Kap six launched
a relentless attack and didn't let up
until the finish. Young put in 16
for Gamma Kap nnd Sylvestri star-
ed for Chi Sig.

Snyles Hull took the Whiz Kids
to the tune of 12-8. This game was
the upset of the evening and the
Snyles six seems to have received
it shot in the arm in the person of
Marge Crumcr.

'l‘hc KD-Stokcs game was slow
moving with very little scoring
throughout the entire game. Thc
scorn was ticd ill. the hull, but KI.)

tcr 11nd dci‘cuicd lhc hum—fighting

Ruth Bentley says, “As a candi—
date for the office of Vice Presi-
dent of Student Association, I pro-
pose and will attempt to carry out,
if I should be elected, a platform of
constitutionality, cooperation, and
recognition — a constitutionality of
student government on the basis of
the newly-revised constitution; co-
operation toward our common goal,
the Student Union, cndeavoring to
keep it constantly before us as an
aim; and recognition of State, urg-
ing all other organizations to join
hands with MAA in paving the way
to popularity and prestige among
other colleges."
Smith

Richard Smith‘s platform states:
“If elected to the office of Vice-
Prcsident 01' Student Association,

to uphold: To work to make the new
constitution a functioning organism
of student life instead of merely
eight pages of mimeographed paper;
to further more social activities spon-
sored by the Student Association as
a whole; to publicize State College
to a greater extent through more
active student co-operation with the
State College Press Bureau, to in—
clude MAA in our budget without
increasing the student tax and with-
out hindering organizations through
too drastic reductions.”

Ililt

The statement obtained from Miss
Hill. is as follows: “My platform for
Vice-President of Student. Associa—
tion evolves around the following
three points or aims: 1. To carry on
the work of helping Student Council
to become the all powerful and yet
democratic body provided for in the
Constitution. Moreover, to help guar-
antee that this body should be made
subordinate to no other group than
that of Student Association, and
that it continue under the revised
Constitution to become the import-
ant functionary body of Student
Government.

2. To aim for more intercollegiate
recognition by attending more inter-
collegiate conferences, publicizing to
a greater degree our own events, and
sponsoring more intercollegiate nf—
f’uirs hcrc :11 our own college.

3. To strengthen college unity.
particularly bctwccn different school
organizations, between commuters
and dorm students, and between stu-
dcnts and faculty."

Balloting

Absentee balloting will take place
'i‘hursday and Friday at the Stamp
Booth in lower Draper. Any person
who has pnid his student tax and

sonoc from assembly may obtain a

To Be Discussed

Articles VI, VII Slated
For Assembly Debate

Discussion of the revised consti-
tution of Student Association will
be continued today in assembly.
Articles I through V were passed
tw0 weeks ago without discussion.
Article VI was started. Section 4
of Article VI concerning Student-
Faculty Relations was hotly disput-
cd, and finally passed in the favor
of Student Council. Today the rest
of Article VI and the beginning of
Article VII will be under discus-
sion.

Points for Discussion

The main topic of discussion for
this morning's assembly will prob-
ably be the method of selection of
Myskanin. due to the omission of
