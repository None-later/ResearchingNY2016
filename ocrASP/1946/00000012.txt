MARY'le SULLIVAN

‘r-irst we think it only right to
give apologies where they are due.
One of our very dear friends seems
to have been very much offended at
something we wrote last week. The
one time friend is Tichy who spent
a perfectly miserable afternoon
Friday because of curious people
who wanted to know what size shoe
she wears—the horrible part of it
is that she had to tell them that
she wears size nine. That isn’t so
horrible when you stop to think of
how high the sizes go in shoes. The
part that really killed her was when
some fellow in the Commons decided
to try on her shoe to see_just how
big it really was—well it fit him, so
now he knows. The moral is—either
don’t go to the Commons or else
if you must go then go in your stock-
ing feet.

Some Memoirs

Remember Camp J olmston — this
is just to remind you that it is still
there. At least we think it isi Fourth
age seems so odd this year with so
little mention of Camp Johnston. We
can remember the days when that
was a source of one of our main
stories. Well we better not say any-
thing—we may have to rely. on
Camp Johnston yet. Anyway smce
we really haven’t heard anything—-
could be that the dear old camp is
snOWed under. One good thing that
the snow is bringing is an oppor-
tunity for a new sport club at State.
' If enough people are interested, a
skiing club may be organized. If
some cars can be obtained, then per-
haps some skiing trips to Vermont
may be made. The only suggestion
we have to make about this is that
the organization be a little on the
speedy side. When something of
this type is discussed the snow usu-
ally begins to melt, so maybe if the
members of the club hurry up, at
least one or two trips can be taken
before the spring thaws!

Complaint Dept.

So many things came ill under
this heading that it is sometimes
hard to try to talk about the ones
that are the most important. One
thing that was brought up this week;
concerns the gym floor. The kids
are supposed to wear sneaks when
they have gym, but ill some way
or other, the floor is becoming
scratched. Also both tile fellows and
the girls are registering complaints
as to the dust on the floor which
leaves them. as one of the girls put
it, “coal black." When the girls
finish gym and the fellows finish
basketball practice. they are lllorc
than ready for the showers—4n fact
baths would be more to the point
and do more good. Couldn't some-
thing be done about this-«like swish-
ing a mop back alld forth once ill a
while?

Gamma Kop’s
Bowling String
Leads ln League

The WAA bowling-league continued
this week as two more matches were
rolled off. They resulted in an up-
set for Moreland, beaten by Gamma
Kap, and a draw in the Psi Gam-
Chi Sig match as each team won
one game.

In last Thursday’s match, Gam-
ma Kap beat Moreland by over 100
pins in the first game, the total
score being 654-543. The second
game also went to Gamma Kap by a
score of 616-589. Dikeman of the
Moreland squad, rolled the highest
single of 167 with Pedisich of Gam-
ma Kap following close behind with
a 162.

The second tie of the season oc-
curred Tuesday when Psi Gam and
Chi Sig each bowled winning games.
There were no exceptional scores
during the match, the high single be-
ing rolled by Regan of Psi Gain with
142.

Nolan was Chi Sig’s high scorer
downing 135 pins. Yel‘don of Psi
Gain, holding the record of 186 in
the tournament, evidently wasn’t
up to par, bowling only 102 and 92.
si Gam took the first game 566 to
531 alld.Clli Sig the second, 583.

Ari/M _
em

By FRANK WOODWORTH

There seems to be considerable
agitation over the ping-pong situ-
ation. Recent practice has shown
that there are far too many ping-
pong enthusiasts than present fa-
cilities can accommodate. The best
p0ssible solution to this problem
seems to be the purchase of a new
table. We suggest that a Men's
Athletic Association committee in-
vestigate the cost of a new table
and equipment, then present this
information to Student Association
with a recommendation that we
buy a new table. We are sure that
the members of Student Association
would approve this purchase.

We also have had maintenance
difficulties. Recently MAA bought
four new paddles and they are al-
ready in a deplorable condition. It
has been the habit of participants
to throw the paddles down on the
benches after they have finished
using them. This is probably done
more in carelessness than in malice
but it results in rapid deterioration
of equipment. Paddles are not made
to stand such rough treatment. The
cork covering becomes loosened and
chips. MAA cannot afford to re-
plenish athletic supplies that are
worn out by carelessness. Let’s
make an effort to be more thought—
ful of the equipment that we now
have.

 

 

Athletic Questionnaires

We would like to devote a little
space here to the athletic question-
naires that have been circulated
among the men of the college. The
purpose of these questionnaires is
to find out where the male athletic
interest lies so we can devote our
new athletic program to your needs
and desires. We, therefore, would
appreciate a 100% response to these
circulars. In that way only can we
adjust our program to fit your likes
and dislikes. Please fill these out
conscientiously so we can judge
what you really want. We now
have enough men to formulate a
:lllj.'s.(-:ll education program but it
is illll‘lcruilvo llilll. we have your
full cooperation to lntikc i! u well
organized progralll.

Intramural Basketball

Tile illli‘llllllli‘ill basketball list is
mounting rather slowly. At the
present writing illL‘l'C are only 21

“ names sgnrd. If (‘llOll’t'll of you

follows are interested we will be
able to set up all intramural sched—
ule for the remainder of file sea-
son. Otherwise. file list will merely
be another sheet of wasted paper.
Due to various activities ill the gym
it will be available only one night
per week but it will be possible to
schedule two on more games iil one
inght. As soon as the list increases
to a workable mullbcr. teams will be
selii ed and games will bcgfn. Don't
hesitate because you feel that you
aren't skilled enough ill basketball
to play. Our purpose ill selling up
this program is to give you an op-
portunity to make yourselves more
proficient alld to erase some of the
abdominal lumps that have made
themselves prominent. Qllli hitting

‘Gamma Kap Six
Hold Top Place

In Basket League

Newman Tops Phi Deli,-
Rares Upset 82 13-11

There were surprises in the air
Tuesday night as two unconquered
teams bowed in defeat and left the
Gamma Kap squad undisputed lead-
ers of the basketball league. The
number 13 seemed to have a magic
spell as Phi Delt lost to Newman
13-10 and the Rares downed BZ 13-
11 in two exciting, well-fought
games.

The Newman-Phi Delt contest was
the lively curtain-raiser on these
mid-season upsets. Each team wary
of the other, the first quarter lacked
precise playing and ended 2-2. The
next period saw Newman gain the
three point lead they held for the
rest of the game. Maggio and Tilden
each made eight points for their
respective teams but Cooper’s steady
pass-work and Sulicll’s clever re-
coveries balanced the scales in New~
man’s favor.

BZ Upset

The game between the Rares and
BZ did not indicate an upset in
the early stages as the BZ team
opened their drive. They managed
to keep the spirited Rares in check
until the last quarter when Davidson
evened the score to 11-11. In the
closing minutes of the period a foul
was called on BZ and Olmstead sank
the two winning foul shots for the
Rarcs.

Gamma Kap Tops KI)

The league leaders themselves
gave an exhibition of the team-work
that put them on top when they
overwhelmed the KD squad 23-5.
True, they didn’t meet with too
much opposition but they proved
that all who plan to challenge their
crown will meet a determined well-
knit team.

Tile other game of the evening
was a match between iho Whiz Kids
and Tommy More. The Whiz Kids
lri‘ullplled ill-12 ill a close but
sloppy game. League games played
on Saturday saw the Rares will—
rillg ovr‘r Psi Gamma 14—6, with
Davidson making nine of the points
for her team. A decisive Moreland
victory was evident over Farrell ill a
near shut—out gullle 27-1. The other
two gullle that were scheduled were
awarded by forfeit, KD to Phi Dell,
and Tommy More to Sziyles.
