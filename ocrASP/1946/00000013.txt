STATE COLLEGE NEWS. FRIDAY. MARCH 8. 1946

 

"The. Glory That We: Greece-n
The Grandeur ThetWas Rome"

In accordance with STATE COLLEGE NEWS policy
FOR THIS WEEK—~“Let’s be Mugwumpsl”———we
present the following dissertation, the contents of
which we gleaned in Latin 108 class (Roman Civil-
ization) and which concern events that occurred
approximately 2,000 years ago. Certainly such a
span of years would guarantee that any issues men-
tioned must be non-controversial, unless we are
so superstitious as to the believe that old adage:

“History repeats itself.”

It seems that at the peak of Greek civilization,
a time when all men were intelligent and civilized,
there existed in Greece the Olympic contests. These
contests included a large variety of games in which
the Greek spectators delighted because of the skill
and knowledge of form that were shown therein.
There were chariot races——judged on the skill of the
charioteers . . boxing bouts—judged on the
skill and form of the contestants . . . athletic games
-—with awards given for technique rather than for
winning.

Then came the Roman conquest of Greece, and
the consequent infiltration of Greek Culture into
the Roman Empire. The chariot races, boxing
fights, and athletic contests were incorporated into
Roman amusements. But, as usual, overwhelming
power caused a period of decadence in the City
of Rome. The chariot races became events spon-
sored for the color and glamour; the boxing bouts
turned into charming expressions of brute force;
and since all this still not satisfy the huge crowds,
the institution of gladiatorial combats in amphi-
theaters was originated. For long hours, the hon-
ored citizens of Rome would sit in gold—and-silver
glittering halls watching, with happy horror, one
man killing another. One day, at the height .of
moral and cultural decadence in Rome, 200 wild
beasts were imported into the city, and it was With
great glee that the Roman citizens observed these
animals tear each other apart. It was the savage
lust of mankind exulting in the hurts and wounds
of others; it was the smug, self—satisfied humans
fighting personal fear of death by glorying 1n the
gory deaths of their fellow-men.

And it was thus that the Greeks, defeated as
they were in physical combat, actually gained a
victorv over their conquerors. It was because of
this that Horace, in praise of Greece, could sing
the following words in a sincere and all—truthful
spirit: “Captive Greece took her rude captor cap-
tivc.”

It’s an old story engraved on the dusty pages
of Roman and Greek text-books, and told in
melody by the Attic poets. It happened so long
a time ago that one feels quite certain that such
ruthless human behavior could never occur today.
Mankind no longer feels the need to make others
suffer, because mankind is no longer uncertain and
fearfiil—-—our philosophers say that the commission
of torture and cruelty is a natural result of fear.

Isn’t it pleasant that ’th‘ firm in (l ricilizcrl arc."

Joyce McDonald, ’46

To the Editor:

Shall we choose Myskania by pop-
ular election or shall they continue
to choose Myskania in the former
traditional manner?

Myskania as formed by faculty in
1917 (later choosing their own
membersi was responsible for form-
ing the Student Association. Today
Student Association recognizes Mys-
kania. but Myskanin is not technic-
ally part of Student Association.
You may speak of Democracy in
Student government and yet if you
strictly apply it. I don‘t see how it
is possible for Student Association

(‘D

to decide how any organization is
to choose its members unless they
in the organization agree.

The issue could be said to be
cold reality vs. sentimentality. The
seeming cold reality is, in truth, the
sentimental product of the times.
We want democracy down to the
point where the entire family takes
a standing vote on how many min-
utes the breakfast eggs should be
cooked. The sentimental side of
the picture—realisticaily may cause
STATE 15 years from now. if we

change the method of selection, to «

sit up and say—“where’s the tradi-
tion (other than Frosh beanies, etc.)
that sets STATE apart from other
colleges?” It boils down to this:

which method, in the eyes of the - i -

student body, is more practical?

Freshmen are impressed by Mys-
kania because they take the or—
ganization as a whole and do not
judge by individuals. On the other
hand, groups of upper elassmeii
want a popular election—it's the
Democratic way—because they have
another candidate. Regardless of
how you choose Myskaiiia there will
always be gripes wherever personali-
ties enter iiito it.

Popular election is not the soili—
tion. particularly this year because:

1. The merits of returning stu-
dents ai'e not known to the general
student body~tiherefore it is unfair
to them.

2. The seniors are the only class
actually qualified to vote. having
an unbiased over-all picture of 3
years’ work.

3. There would be more ill feel—
ing and hurt feelings if an open list
of candidates were published.

4. Group politics would have an
open field to operate.

5. You can post a list of com—
mittees that a person has worked
on, but unless you were there, how
can you know he deserves credit
for the job?

6. The man who talked, the job
would stand a better chance of
making Myskania than the man
who did the job. It would turn out
to be a, free for all popularity con-
test with half of the Junior class
nominated.

It’s a known fact that a small
group operates more efficiently than
a. large one and Myskania as the
small body with many contacts in
school is the only group to make the
selection.

We don't need an elected Mys-
kania to prevent them from getting
too much power. Remember—Mys-
kania’s actual power is very small.
They’re not a bunch of cut throats!

Sincerely,
Bea—Jay Schoonmaker, ’48

Little did they think that. back
in the days when an airplane was
the dream of two brothers iiamcd
Wright, that its world importance
would bring about flight instruc—
tion in college curriculunis. Yet. all
over the country colleges are be-
ginning to prepare students for this
cvci'-liici'casing era of aeronautics.

('lswi-go niid Cortland Slate 'i‘cacli—
ci's‘ Colleges ill‘t' making claboi'uic
plans to further this movemciit. The
administration of Cortland plans to
prepare trained icuchci's for this
field in a summer school session
conducted on a seminar basis. The
program consists of "touching meth-
ods and flight techniques suitable
for the secondary school, including
a non-technical consideration of
[lift theory of flight, air—craft. struc-
tures, cugiucs, flight techniques,
navigation, wciithr-r. coinunu’iicn-
lions and control, and allied sub—
jccts. In addition cigiit hours of
flying instruction will be given iii.
the )ortiand airport. Though not
yet certified, the course will carry
six hours of credit.”

With the facilities of the Albany
Airport so close at hand it would
appear reasonable for such a course
to be inaugurated here at State. The

AN & IIIL'I‘

trend in hiin schools is definitely
toward the injection of flying
courses iiilo their program, and the
need for trained instructors will be
acute.

(’ompi'omiscs

Speaking of Cortland we noticed
flint one of our former profs. Dr.
I). V. Smith. President of Cortland
College, is chairman of a hospital
arbitration coiiiiiiiitcc which is ut-
tciupllug to with u pi'oblciii aris-
ing from difficulties ovcr :ciici'ul
hospital care and private nursing.

Last year Stale (.‘oiicgc sponsored
scvci'ul cvciiis to make students
more aware of arbitration methods.
whereby two dissenting groups call
on u disinterested third gmin to
settle their differences.

These. events included: Sending
delegates to an arbitration confer-
cuce in New York, presenting guest
speakers to t'.\'])litlll arbitration pro-
cedures, and organizing discussion
groups on campus to popularize this
practice.

FROM THE HALLS OF . . .

Fred Fancher, ’47, has been a Marine—stationed
at Parris Island. South Carolina—for some time now.
. . Mr. Slack-Share, President-In-Law of Student
Association, returns home, a full-fledged civilian this
week . . . (.l-Iavc yeti got friends from State still in

FROM THE RIDICULOUS-TO THE STORK CLUB

The Kreml Hair Tonic Co., is sponsoring the. snoot-
icst advertisement these days. featuring 21 “red hot
tip" from the Stork Club's barber, John Auzulone.
on what the “scalp requirements" are for :i guest to
be admitted past the famous red rope in the Club's
lobby into its lavish interior. Says Mr. Aiizalouc, be-
low a picture of ii man with it mossy nuiiic. “Watch
the. red rope go up on the mini with tousleil, llllkcli’ipt
hair. He certainly doesn’t belong in the Stork Club."
(use Krmnl . . . t Then we see the ltomeo with
plastered-down locks of whom Mr. Aiiziiloiie says,
“He plastered his hair down with grease and found
himself socially taboo. Posted down hair stumped llllll
as a gigolo." (use Krc'nil . . . ) Next: is portrayed the
bird's nest type of hair-(lo, and the charm-fer sport-
ing it is also barred from the inside of the. Stork
Club because they won’t let the red rope down for
him. “How uncouth he looks," says the harbor, “with
his shoulders littered with dandruff flakes. So care-
less about his appearance!" (use It'ri'ml . . . l Col-
umnist’s Note: I don‘t l)(.‘ll(l’i.‘(.’ 'il.’ Can't you just pic-
ture Tommy Maiivillc being ejected from the Stork
Club because his dandruff is showin? (Speaking of
Tommy Manville, I wonder if he has his dandruff
monogrammed . . .)

OPINION

Why is it such a great part of every year is spent
bickering with Mysknnia on relatively unimportant
issues. The question, “How should Myskaiiia mem-
bers be chosen" is a relatively unimportant one be-
cause Student Association can make as many "mis-
takes" choosing new Myskania members as Mysknn-
in. itself can. Believe it or not, there are other fea-
tures of State College life that might be given some
of the large amount of time allotted to Myskaiiia
“bull scssions”—such as:

1) The “Spiral Staircase” that 1100 students have
to climb at a 45 degree angle to get into a library
which, when you get there, is too poorly ventilated
to study in anyhow.

2) slightly nauseous students piled three deep on
back-breaking cots in an ugly, thin-walled recovery
room flint once you try to sleep in it. you require
a week's recovery to get back into the. state you
originally came in . . .

3) overcrowded conditions in a too-small Commons
at noontimc

Etc. Etc. Etc.
There really are important issues with which we
should be concerned other than Myskaiiia arguments.
Since these arguments come up. time and again,
the question should be reduced to a basic one: Dot-s
Student Association want ii Myskania? If tho :iii-
swcr is in the negative, carry out your convictions
and do something about it: if it is in the ai't'i‘mzuivc.
and you want it, don‘t try to find fault at every pos-
sible occiisfon leave the minor problems alone and
spend time on more vital questions.

The first thing’ we would like to
do is give a terrific pat 0n the back
to our basketball team for the game
they played against. Sieiia last Tues-
day night. It was the best game of
the season and the boys certainly
did a wonderful job.

The crowds of State. routers that
were there serve to show that State
supports its team not. only at home
games but also when the (cam plays
away. ill fact. S‘dit‘ had almost as
minty iiill'i lll’f"'x(‘ll it}; did Sit-1m

Next Item

Second on the list of things to dis-
cu...‘ is what has happened to the
so—cullcd rivalry spirit around here.
We can remember when the Soph-
fi'osli rivalry basketball games were
something that people (meaning
representatives from all the classes
with main emphasis on members
from the two rivalry clnsscsl really
attended. This doesn't seem to be
the story this year. From the at-
tendance at. the last Soph-frosli ri-
valry game we would say that some-
thing had definitely happened to
the rivalry spirit between the two
classes. Rivalry events this year
seem to be things flint are carried
off because they have to be—not be-
cause rivalry is a tradition at State
which up until this year was some,-
ihing that. everybody used to be iii—
intcrcsted in. What‘s happening to
all of our traditions?

By FRANK WOODWOETH

*Oh, my aching back!

Such were the cries and means of
intramural basketball aspirants
after the first night of "informal"
practice. Informal practice-that’s
a nice polite word for an ugly con-
glomcrntion of arms, legs. cuts,
scratches, bruises, floor burns and
small bits of skin that results when
ten people want the same object——
a, spherical hunk of leather. Fooled
you, didn’t we?

At any rate practice was a huge
success. Someone threw in a ball
like a zoo keeper throwing a single
herring to a bunch of seals. Im-
mediately all the players, includ-
ing the referee—Sullivan, the rob-
ber—stood on their hind legs and
barked. This, figuratively and lit-
erally. started the ball rolling and
the heat was on. We hereby wish
io publicly denounce one Harry
linden as a disreputable wretch—
and ii dirty player to boot. The
game proceeded in a gentlenianly
mumici‘ which was pleasing to all.
By z..'.oiiiiciiiaiily manner we mean
that fouls were committed openly

‘ iii the face of the person attempt—

lug~ ii shot. When all ieii cOiit'.est.~
ants llilfi progressively crawled to
the sidelines leaving- the “referee
(here We are misusing English v0—
tiibiilui‘yl holding the ball, it was
quilc unanimously decided flint the
two teams (five players who are
theoretically on the same side make
up a team) should substitute. Again
play rcsuiiicd and this time things
were dillercntmone of the teams
scoi'i-d a basket when the referee
wasn't; looking. The manslaughter
continued until time for varsity
practice and the Lin. boys left the
floor with the glowing satisfaction
that they could at last have a leg-
itimate excuse for taking a cut.

slightly exaggerated.
More About Intramurnls

Irrespective of the report written
above, practice went along very
Well and a good number of fellows
showed up. Howaver. we do need
more players to form a league for
the remainder of the season and we
appeal to you fellows to come out
whether or not you have had ex-
perience. Men's Athletic Associa-
tion is your organization and we
need your active support. MAA is
not a club of a select few. Every
man in school can become a mem-
ber by simply expressing the desire
to do so. If you have paid your
student tax or are enrolled under
the “GI. Bill" there is no indivi»
dual expense involved. The amount
of your activity depends entirely
upon you.

This is iioi. only a school ruling but

it constitute a fire hazard but. also

Psi Gem Wins 

Scoring Upset

BZ Defects Chi Sig,-
Sccond Game Delayed

Wednesday nights basketball
games got off to a slow start when
out Sig was, forced to bow to the
powerful BZ squad to the tune of
25-6. Baker started off with a field
goal for B2 and Sylvestri put one in
for Chi Sig. Chi Sig missed several
foul shots while the BZers main-
tained a steady pace. BZ’s height
proved too much for the Chi Sig’s
to battle despite their quick recov-
eries of the ball on the part of the
guards. Baker was high scorer for
the victors, Dunlay for the losers.

The Gamma Kap-Psi Gam game
proved to be the upset of the eve-
ning. It was fast moving from the
beginning, and until the final whis-
tle. blew it was anybody’s ball game.
At the outset of the first quarter,
Quinn opened up by scoring a field
goal for Gamma Kap. Not to be out-
done. sown dropped one in for‘Psi
(lam. From then on both teams
tightened up their defenses and the
quarter ended in a tie 2-2.
Lcngycl Stars

Lciigyel opened up the second
quarter with a field goal and Os-
borne followed suit for Game. Kap
and added a foul shot to it. Lengyel
followed through with two more
field goals and the second quarter
ended 8—5 in favor of Psi-Gum.

After the half, Gamma Kap
buckled down and enthusiasm was
high when Osborne dropped in an-
other. However, Psi Gain had an
eye to victory and Lcngyel dropped
in two more to make it 12-7 at the
end of the third quarter.

The fourth quarter was fast but
both teams had steadied and it was
impossible for either to score. The
game ended 12-7 in Psi Gems favor.
Game Postponed

The third game was between New-
man and Moreland, but it was poet-
poned at the beginning of the sec-
0nd quarter when Tronsor was hurt.
Newman had the lead, 16-0.

After Saturday’s games, each
team wil have played a total of eight
games. This will end the second
elimination. Any team loosing four
straight games again will be elimin-
ated. The remaining teams will
play off the league and the team
standing will be posted on the WAA
bulletin board Monday.
