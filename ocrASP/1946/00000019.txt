Three months late, nevertheless,
we have decided to make a resolu-
tion! At this time feeling in a bene-
volent mood, we are resolved never
to make a nasty remark about any-
one, say anything at all that would
make anyone feel embarrassed or
tell any secrets that people wouldn’t
want told. Isn’t that wonderful?
Now you may read on without fear.

The game last Wednesday night
between State and Hartwick saw
the end of the basketball season for
this year. A marked contrast was
seen between the number of people
attending the first game of the sea-
son and this game. What happen-
ed to some of those rooters who
usually come to all of State’s games?
This week of mid-sems must be the
answer. It does seem however, that
for the final game of the season,
more people could have come . .
We even noticed some of the faculty
here for the game—well you say,
they only make up the mid-sems—
we have to pass them!

Apologies Department

First of all we want to apologize
to Tichy . . . we haven’t been men-
tioning her feet lately and we hear
that she feels deeply hurt. From
now on, in our effort to please
everyone. we will put feet at the
end of the column as a token of
friendship and to show our dear
Tichy that we are thinking of her.

Next on the list of those we wish
to apologize to is Bolo M. whom
we mentioned last week. Friday
was his bh‘thday—and here we were
making all those nasty cracks about
him4wasn’t that awful? We really
shouldhave waited until this week.
Incidentally, while we are on the
topic, Bolo tells us he can’t imagine
why "everybody thinks he’s cute. So
if you know please drop him a note
via student mail and let him in on
the deep dark secret. We know it
would help him a lot and we’re sure
he’d love to find out.

Tears and Sorrows

With tears in our eyes we see the
end of the basketball season. State
saw the beginning of the season
with the return of the vets and
watched the team play long before
they thought they would. Many
thought that there couldn’t possibly
be a basketball season for State
this year.

Others were pessimistic about the
record State would have if we at-
tempted to have a team this year
when there was so little time for
practice. Yet the fellows and Coach
Hathaway went ahead and State
once again had a basketball team.
Thanks—it really was something for
those of us who like to see men's
basketball. it was a good season.

Not More!

There are more additions to those
clubs we were telling you about last
week. The new additions are the
KB. BC. and MB. clubs. ' Ah—
they grow and grow—4t must be the
spring sunshine.‘

Guess What

We received a letter from Camp
Johnson the other day telling us
that she feels deeply hurt. Remem-
ber the “Back To Camp Johnson
Movement" that was started last
semester"? Well there is now a
“Climb The Indian Ladder Move-
ment" going on. We have u suspi-
cion that the expeditions going
there are not going for the purpose
of looking for fossils. Oh well fresh
air is good for thclungswit is good
for the lungs isn’t it?

Next week comes the surprise of
the semester. We are going to read
fourth page without the slightest
idea of what is going to be on it.
You see next week the Sophomores
are taking over the issue. The only
thing we can say is. “Please Shapiro
‘ no matter how much Tichy pays
ou, don't let her write this whole
column about her feet!"

 Hartwicltépeieats State
in Final Game, 54-41

Evans High  1515;
Game Climexes Session

Bowing to the tricky Hartyick
cagers by a score of 54-41, the State
Varsity wound up its season on
Wednesday night before andgen-
thusiastlc crowd of fans. Although
the score books proclaimed Hart-
wick the victors. the State team
proved to be a challenge to the ex—
perienced Hartwick players.

The first quarter saw both teams
moving the ball up and dowr. the
court in rapid succession. The Hart-
wick five showed unusual skill in in-
terception as time and again" they
stole the ball from the State. play-
ers. However. it was nipf and tuck
through the first quarter as 'Hart-
wick led at the end 11-10. The Hart-
wick invaders opened their thrust
in the second period as long and
short shots alike made their way
through the hoop. Not to be out—
done, the State five tightened their
defenses and tallied eight points to
bring the score to 24-18 Hartwick. as
the half ended.

Third Quarter Thrilling

The third quarter held the thrills
of the game as Evans, sparkplug-
ging the State team, sent along shot
from center through the basket to
start the scoring for State. Feeney
followed through with two baskets
bringing the score up to 26-25. As
the quarter ended the score stood
37-31 in favor of Hartwick.

For the remainder of the game,
Hartwick led although Mullin. Fee-
ney and Evans found the mark sev—
eral times to bring the score to 41
points for ,‘State, while Hartwick
had succeeded in accounting for 54

oints.

The State team was hampered by
the absence of Bob Combs who was
put out of action due to an injury.
Despite the fact that the victory
was not ours. the players displayed
basketball technique, good team
work, and that neded fighting
spirit. And so, State College takes
off its hat to Coach Hathway and
the fellows on the team who have
proven that State College has a firm

place in the athletic world.

attend. The official play-day open-
ed at 1:30 sharp. Each side had
three teams which they alternated
throughout six quarters. The score
was totaled and State won 43-31. It
was a good game, and evidences of
sportsmanship Were very obvious on
both sides.

After the games, Skidmore gave

Mullin Winner,
Defeats Wagner
In Final Match

The MAA Ping-Pong Tournament
was completed last Tuesday as
Fran Mullin beat Paul Wagner. This
brings to an end the second MAA
Singles tourney of the year. In the
ﬁrst contest Wagner gained the
championship by beating Herb
Weiner, ’47.

Fran Mullin moved up into the
finals by topping both Lashinsky
and Oarr. In the Mullin-Lashinsky
match, Mullin took every other
game, the first one going to Lashin-
sky. The fifth game ended 21-15
for Mullni, bringing him up into
the finals.

The finals proved to be a tough
fight for both contestants as it took
all of seven games to decide the
winner. Wagner had won the first
game easily and it looked as if he
would take four straight. Mullin
seemed to lose the steadiness he
usually displays. Several times
during the second game he missed
shots and was slower than usual on
the return. Wagner kept a steady
stream of shots going over the net
and ended up by taking the game.
Mullin picked up on the third game
and both boys played a hard, steady
match with Mullin ending up in the
lead. Wagner couldn’t be downed
that easily and retaliated in the
fourth. Once more it seemed as if
Wagner would come out on top.

Mullin kept up his steady game
and even pace and got back into
true Mullin style by the fifth match.
Wagner really had to move and did
so from then on, but Mullin held
the upper hand all the way through.
His shots remained steady as Wag-
ner lost his proficiency and return-
ed fewer and fewer. By winning
the fifth and sixth games, Mullin
tied the score 3-3. Mullin remain-
ed in top form using some shots
which he had perfected since his
last match. These seemed to stop
Wagner and the game ended to the
tune of 21-17 in Mullin’s favor.
This finished up one of the tough-
est matches in the whole tourna-
ment.

Gem Kap Five
Remains Only
Undefeated, Team

Louise Winters and Mary Van
Golder, Juniors, captains of the
WAA bowling league, have hopes
that the games will all be played
by Easter vacation. As yet, Gamma
Kap is the only undefeated team
left in the league. Phi Delt and
Sayles are tied for second, each
team losing one match.

For the first time this year, two
Learns have tied one game. AEPhi
and Chi Sig performed this almost
impossible sol, and since Chi Sig
won the first game they will have
to take the next one to win the
game. In the other game Thursday
Pierce defeated Stokes in both
games winning easily by one. hun-
dred points in each match.

In ’l‘ucsduy's matches, BZ forfeit-
ed to Gamma Kup, and Psi Gum
topped Moreluud by small margins.

By FRANK WOODWORTH

Before the war the men of State
had a very popular institution
known as “Frosh Camp.” It was a
large camp site on Lake Cossayuna
and it belonged to the,Y.M.C.A. It
was a good opportunity for upper-
classmen and fresh to become ac-
quainted. Camp started on the
Friday before registration week and
ended on Sunday night and
has been sorely missed by the fel-
lows that remember all the fun.
Now there are no more restrictions
upon travel and it would seem we
may be able to resume this pleasur-
able institution.

Varsity Baseball?

Many students and faculty mem-
bers have asked this department if
there is any possibility of re-estab-
lishing varsity baseball at State.
We believe that it will be possible
if there is enough male interest and
ability to put a team on the field.
It is true that we have little, or no
equipment and we lack a ball park
but the enthusiasm of the students
toward basketball leads us to be-
licVe that they would be favorably
inclined toward ii. We could hold
practice on Beverwyck Park and
could play a few home games at
Bleecker Stadium if our home
schedule coincided with that of oth-
er teams using the field. It looks
like a big job for MAA to tackle but
basketball also looked pretty diffi-
cult. It is the opinion of this de-
partment that it can be done.
More Expansion .

In keeping with our aim to re-
store MAA to its prewar status, it
has been suggested that a tennis
tournament be sponsored this spring-
with a possibility of matches with
nearby schools. This, and the pos-
sibility of a golf tournament, will
be discussed in the meeting of MAA
Council which will be held soon.
The Call of the Wild

Have you got troubles? Are you
getting sick and tired of poring
over books under the pretense of
studying? If so, come out for our
hiking club which is being organ-
ized. (Bortnick wants to know if
it will be co-educational.) MEN,
this is your chance to get away from
it all. If a sufficient number are
interested we will be able to take
little trips up to Indian Ladder and
other nearby places of interest. We
regret to say that it won't be coed.

Basketball Season
Nearing Finish,-
To Encl April 2

. Stokes,Morelencl, Seyles
Lose Week's Games

On Tuesday night, four more
games were played off in the has-

ketball league. Gamma Kap de-
feated Stokes 25-10. Last year's
victors played a sloppy first half,
but Young and Quinn rolled up the
score to lead their team to another
victory.

Beta Zeta trounced Moreland 27-
6. Baker was high scorer for the
winners with 15 points, followed by
Casey with 8.

In the third contest, Phi Delt
beat Sayles to the tune of 27-13.
Michel had 13 points for the winners
and Pulver made 7 for the losers.

Newman added another victim to
their list in defeating the Rares in
a hard fought contest. The final
score was 15-9. As usual, Maggie
lead her team, with eight points.
The Rares’ star player Davidson was
high with seven.

Final Round

Most of the league teams will play
them final games next week. The
Monday afternoon games will prob-
ably not be too exciting as the con-
clusions are foregone. Tuesday
night, however, schedules what
might prove to be a very interest-
ing contest. The BZ-Phi Delt game
can hold surprises if the BZ squad
rallies from its last defeat and
challenges Phi Delt‘s league stand—
ing. The Wednesday tilts are de—
batable but results will probably
not seriously affect final league re-
sults except to determine the rela—
tive standings of Newman and Psi
Gain. Barring possible upsets the
game of the season will be played
Tuesday, April 2nd, between Phi
Delt and Gamma Kap.

The schedule for the final games
is as follows:

Monday, March 25

Phi Delt vs. Tommy More 4

Moreiand vs. Psi Gam 4:
Tuesday, March 26 .

Gamma Kap vs. Tommy More 7 :00

This finishes up the league for
this year. The basketball captains
have announced that anyone who
is not on a regular team must have
come to ten practices and those who
played on eliminated teams must
have a total of ten times from
games and practices for credit.
Scorers and timers must have ten
games credited to them in order to
obtain WAA recognition, all of
these do not necessarily have to be
recordings of their own team.
