   Review

 

 

A near me snarmo
Now that we have recovered from
those: "Quiz Kid" examsu‘), We’ve
decided ‘0 take over Mary Liz's
column. But before we start, let’s
e So he.
hgiﬁlcrffglﬂmllthhﬁi RTAH! RAH!
Now to the business at hand, or
should We say feet. (Attention
Sullivan!)
Have you passed the WAA bulle-
tin board lately? Well . . .
' “Spring is sprung,
The grass is riz,
I wonder where

The treeses 12?”
P. S. Refer all queries to Mindy,

Commissioner of' Bulletin Board.
We don’t know what expectorate
means but we do know some big
words too, like delikatesin.

Riddle of the Age
Last year the question was

“where are all the men?” The an-
swer is all around you, in the math
department, the science lab, the
science lab, etc. The halls are now
generously sprinkled with birds on

the wing—(Vets to you).
After last week’s editorial even

the balcony ‘brigade has moved

 

.
.;.i

,down to the main floor of the Com-

mons. Of course, this would have
nothing to do with the ping-pong
table being moved up on the bal-
cony.

Sentimentality has come to the
fore as jive is on the wane. The
vets must like slow. smooth numbers
from the music drifting out into
the lOWer hall.

Get on the Band Wagon

MAA sofa-wrestling has some
stiff competition from those sturdy
members of WAA who have recently
developed hitch-hiking into a new
science. It’s not a local affair as
some of the girls have ventured as
far as Cornell and Vermont. Every-
body’s doing it now and it isn’t safe
to drive these days. In fact it’s
cheaper to hitch.

Basketball

The game between Phi Delt and
Beta Zeta was refereed and um-
pired by outside women. State was
the meeting place for those who
were to take their final local and
national ratings as basketball ref-
erees and umpires. Mrs. John Rol-
lins of Russell Sage and Ellen
Overbaugh of Bethlehem Central
blew the whistle on the game. Rep-
resentatives were here from Delmar,
Emma Willard, and Convent of Sa-
cred Heart.

It’s all up to the Quail Street
stars to stop the hard-fighting Phi
Delta when the game is played April
2. If Gamma Kap wins and Psi
Gain tops BZ there will be a three-
way tie for first place. Of course
this is still in the “if” stage and
it’s still anyone’s trophy.

MAA

In thumbing through the News
for the last few years, we found
mentioned a baseball team. tennis
team, and a track squad. This
year, with the fellows back, there is
no reason why State can’t. have
matches in all these events. On
checking the MAA bulletin board,
We found lists of fellows who had
signed up. In fact there were 14
signatures on the baseball list. If
a few more will only sign up, the
fellows will be all set for a heavy
schedule.

With Washington Park so close to
the school, enough courts will be
available for the men to practice on
and State will be in the tennis
limelight again for the first time
in many years.

Bowling And Swimming
Next Rivalry Games

Even in their freshman year. State
College was amazed at the potential
athletic abilities of the Class of ’48.
Working together with skill and en-
thusiasm, the Sophs were all but
crowded out of the rivalry sport-
light.

Ping-pong, bowling and softball
were crowning achievements for the
yellow daffles. The results of the
ping-pong tournament was a smash-
ing victory for ’48 through the out-
standing skill of Bob Horseman.

Not to be outdone by the stronger
sex—’48’s women took over softball
with a. bang. With Peg Daly as
“queen of the mound” and Lydia
Boynton hitting the top with her
batting average, the Sophomores
reached in vain for those precious 3
points. The fresh also gave a nod
of approval when WAA announced
State’s All-Star basketball team
with ’48 holding the 2 sub positions.

So started '48's spirited sports
career that was to rise to new
heights during their second year.
Soph Year

The Campus Day events consti-
tuted the official opening of rival-
ry for ’45-’46. Here the Sophs start-
ed their ciimb to victory when
"Feet' Tichy won the sackrace and
gained a point for the rivalry score.

Three more points were added as
the Sophomores emerged victorious
in the hockey game. With one of
the strongest teams in State’s his-
tory, the game ended in a 2-0 shut-
out, Tilden and Quinn sharing the
scoring honors.

The basketball games, however,
confirmed without a doubt the
qualities that make ’48 “best class
at State." Cooperation, skill, team-
work and good sportsmanship, best
describe the yellow powerhouse that
defeated the red devils 36-28 in the
first encounter and 38-28 in the
final playoff. The steady working
combination —— Diehl, Diffin, and
Tronsor supplied a defense that
could not be penetrated by the fresh
basketeers. In the forward positions
——Cooper, Tilden, and Quinn dis-
played a perfected system of pass-
work, plays, and shooting that would
provide a serious challenge to the
best of teams.

In the Future

The balance of the rivalry points
in sports is still to be determined
and from all aspects it seems that
the Sophomores have a rosy future
ahead.

The next event will probably be
bowling. Following bowling comes
ping pong~—incldenta11y, Mullin and
Wagner, this year’s champs, are both
members of the Sophomore class—
swimming and softball.

Which Just goes to show that the

Sophs know what they’re saying
when they yell—“so for victory, in

the end. better send for ’48'crsii"

First Camp Johnston Visit
Or, Info The Wild World

The Back to Camp Johnson
Movement has brought several
stiffs back to State on recent
Mondays. (“Stiffs" being used
in connection with those who
carried the pails up the grade.
from the creek.) Up until last
weekend we brave souls thought
that Albany had more than its
share of hills; however the
Chatam roads were built with
the idea in mind that we all
would be better off with a bet-
ter view of heaven.

We trekked up and down the
nearby hills with the thought
in mind that we could always
sooth our smarting feet in the
creek. Every time we attempted
this, more than half of us lost
our balance and were sure we
were lost to humanity (in all of
two feet of water!). While our
feet were turning blue, our faces
were acquiring that rosy shade
which comes with spring’s sun
and wind.

Yes, we came back burned,
scratched and tired; but we
wouldn’t have missed it for the
world. It was the first visit for
several of us, and we were well
impressed. The laughs we had,
the food we ate (?), and the
sleep we didn’t get, make up a
good part of our memories of
last weekend. We’re all looking
forward to the next time when
we can get up there to raise
cain, and to forget the woes of
State tests.

 

 

 

Bowling League
Nears Semi-Final

The WAA Bowling Tournament
continued this week with only one
game being played off. Last Thurs-
day, Sayles Hall outpinned Wren
Hall by 182 pins.

Lewis and Van Gelder led the
winning team to victory, each bowl-
ing an average of 141 in both games.
For the losing team Ward led with
an average of 119. Both matches
Were won by a wide margin by the
Sayles squad. In the first game
they led with 82 pins to spare. and
in the second game they had an
even hundred over Wren.

Louise Winters, '47, has announc-
ed that at the end of this week all
teams which haven’t won any games
will be eliminated. Also, Miss Win-
ters said that the bowling tourna-
ment should be over by the end of
April.

An announcement has been plac—
ed on the WAA bulletin board stat-
ing that any team that does not ap—
pear at the bowling alloys at the
scheduled time must forfeit. All
games must be completed the same
week scheduled or they will be for-
feited. These rules have been on-
forced lately in order to speed up
the completion of the tournament.

The new swing band, organ-
ized just a few weeks ago, has
been rehearsing furiously in
secluded spots (Sayles Hall gym
included). It's been strictly on
the hush-hush side until enough
numbers had been learned to
give a good show.

Sometime next week, the
group will drop anchor in the
Commons at noon to give out
with the jive for the jitterbug
fiends and swing for the swoon-
ers. There will be a charge of
ten cents to pay for new music.

If enough interest is shown
in the band, it may play for
school dances or other enter-
taimnents.

Since the year ’41-‘42, there
has been no successful attempt
to organize a swing band, un-
til some members of the class
of ’49 got together this year.
Things are looking plush!

 

Open Lovenheim
Literary Contest

All undergraduate students are
eligible to enter the annual Leah
Lovenheim Literary Contest which
is now in progress under the direc-
tion of Dr. Shields McIlwalne, Pro-
fessor of English. May 10 is the
deadline for the submittance of all
articles.

Faculty to Judge

A faculty committee will judge
poetry, short stories, and non-fic-
tion articles, the latter class includ-
ing personal essays and biographical
sketches. Twenty-five dollars
prizes will be offered for the best
selection in each field. Five dollars
will be awarded for the best poem,
and ten dollars each for the best
short story and non-fiction article.

Each piece of work entered must
be typed double space, signed with
a pseudonym and accompanied by
a separate sheet designating the
entrant's name, the pseudonym us-
ed and the title of the paper. There
are no restrictions either in form
or length for these entries, which
should be brought to Dr. McIl-
waine's office, Room 36, Richard-
son. One entry of each type may
be made.

Seek More Entries

In other years the response to
the contest has not been very great.
This year, Dr. McIlwaine hopes
that more students with creative
ability will submit articles.

Poetry will be Judged by Dr. Mc—
llwulne but the judges for the
short story and non-fiction have
not yet been chosen.

Alaska Explorer

Sayles To Announce
New Signum Laudis

Harold Elde. an explorer recently
returned from Alaska, will present
an address in assembly today fol-
lowing an announcement by Dr.
John M. Sayles, President of the
College, of the new members of Sig-
num Laudis. At the Student Coun-
cil meeting Wednesday evening, the
Moving-Up Day speakers were chos-
en for each class and plans were
discussed for the scheduling of a

special assembly period to consider 1

business matters.

Dr. Sayles will introduce the
principal speaker. Mr. Eide, who
will discuss his travels and experi-
ences.

List Speakers

During the Student Council meet-
ing the Moving-Up Day speakers

chosen to represent the Sophomores
and Betsy Franks will speak for the
freshmen. All speeches are to be
from five to ten minutes long, with
the Junior and Senior addresses
presented from a serious angle. The
freshmen and Sophomores will add
a humorous touch to their talks.

Mrs. Helen Slack Shure, President

sembly session. The article to the
constitution suggested by Philip
Lushinsky, ’47, during assembly on
Friday. March 22, which provides
for the formation of a temporary
judicial board, must still be acted
upon. The article will be brought
before Student Association some
time soon.

Lack 01‘ Help
To Keep Library
Closed Evenings

In response to the News poll three
weeks ago, the majority of students
approached expressed a desire for
the re-opening of the library at
night. Miss Mary E. Cobb, College
Librarian, has explained the ob-
stacles in the way of returning to
the pre-war schedule, discontinued
four years ago.

Until that time, the library re-
mained open from 7:00 until 9:00
P. M. on Monday through Thurs-
day. There were 150 hours of stu-
dent help available under the Na-
tional Youth Association, which
aided students working their way
through college. Most of the work
done by the students was of a rou-
tine nature, such as filing, return-
ing books to shelves, etc. As this
program was discontinued about
two years ago, no provision has
been made for another plan.

At the present time, only about
five hours of student work per week
are available. According to Miss
Cobb. this time is taken up in doing
clerical work. All the work former-
ly taken care of by student help is
now done by the general staff.

In addition to the lack of help,
an increase in the difficulty in pur-
chasing new books has intensified
the problem, due to the necessity of
sending in some orders two or three
times and greater care in checking.

If the library is to remain open
at night. two of the regular staff
will have to be in attedancc, one
at the out-going and one at the re-
sci'vc desk. The suggestion has
been made that students taking li-
brary courses might help, but this
plan is not feasible at present, as
the some amount of supervision
would be necessary.

At the time when the library was
open, there was a large number 01'
students working from 7:00 until
11:00 but the number dropped sharp-
1y after 8:00 on nights when other
activities Wil'C scheduled in school.
II was licocssul'y to keep the library
()Ili'il for the very few who remained
until 9:00 PM.

in the event of u rc«opening, re-
serve books. which may be taken
out for overnight use. would have
in be lclt in the shelves for evening
reference work. This might work
hardship on those who are unable
to got to the library at night, Miss
Cobb says.

In addition to these factors, Miss
Cobb believes that the library
lighting would have to be improved
to facilitate evening study.
