Day

 

 

By Jinny Day

Sometimes life seems very futile.
This is one of those times. I feel
completely enveloped in the vicious
cycle. My freshman year, last year,
and even this year I cherished the
idea that someday I would be able
to write a column of my own. The
time has come . . . I have 100 blank
lines to do just what I please with.
I thought. So what happens! I
say to Sullivan, “Can I really write
about anything I please?" The look
scared me half to death, but she
didn't have to yell way across the
PO. where all the Sophomore desk
editors could hear, did she? So I
can't talk about the fan club I’m in,
or how hard I work on my comp
(honest I do, Miss Hopkins), or how
much fun my room-mates and I
had on a picnic at Indian Ladder,
or the new stink pinks I learned
this week. (I’m gonno stick ’em in
later when Sullivan isn’t around.)
I’ll write about sports, I’ll be so ath-
letic that I’ll say one team defeated
another in ten different places in
ten different ways . . . in some oth-
er issue, of course.

About Softball

Reading over the ’42 files we dis-
covered that the question of soft-
ball was even then hanging pre-
cariously in the balance. . . Shall
we or shan't we have a team? Gee
Whiz tellers, you don’t want our
very first attempt to be the obitu-
ary for what could be one of State’s
major sports, do ya, huh? Every.-
body is so discouraging though . . .
Maybe they wouldn't be if they had
seen the softball game on the dorm
field Saturday afternoon. (Softball
is significant because anybody good
in softball would be good in baseball
too because baseball and softball
are sorta related, aren’t they?) Any-
way, both fellows and girls played,
and at least the girls admit that
they're stiff, aching, and practically
unconscious this week . . . not men-
tioning any more than a few names,
Lashinsky, Woodworth, Feeney,
Reed and Evans. Seriously though,
State has the man power now, and
equipment could be rounded up,
couldn't it? Sure!

Tennis Is the Subject

In the spring a young man's
fancy is supposed to turn to
thoughts of love . . . everywhere but
at State College it happens like it
ought to. Here it’s softball, volley-
ball, tennis, or tennis, or tennis.
Speaking of tennis, an incentive is
always a good thing, like a cup for
instance. There was one once—it’s
been out of circulation for so long
that it's probably old and rusty
now. How about a nice new shiny
one hmmmm? Also, a sheet on the
bulletin board for both the fellows
and girls to sign up on. . . One for
MAA. one for WAA. then the win—
ners of each could play for the
championship. Anybody interested?
Not for Classification

Now for the newest addition to
the athletic program—Astink Pink.
Here's some “sporty” ones for your
consideration.

letic monster? (Stinky Pinky)

2. What is a conversation between

3. What is a good looking ath-
lete? (Stink Pink)

4. A fight betwwn slnall athletes?

5. A well-knmvn athlete's shoes?

6. The long trip sports enthusiasts.

7. The pastime of the sports ed-
itor between issues? (Stink Pink)

Delta forfeiting to Psi Gamma and
the Sayles, Chi Sig strings split.
The deciding game will be played
next week.

544. In the second game Chi Sig
surged ahead to 704 while Sayles
fell down to 620.

32 Sta 3 Psi Gem,
Three ied For Second

Phi Delt defeated Gamma Kap,
Wednesday night, 42-34, to gain the
basketball trophy and the cham-
pionship for this year. Seymour,
with 18 points and Tilden with 15
points led the winners, while Quinn
tallied 17 for the Quail St. six.

In the first encounter BZ set back
Psi Gamma, 22~11, to make a three
way tie for second place. ,These
two teams and Gamma Kap have
each lost three games.

In the Phi Delt-Gamma Kap en-
counter, Seymour started the at-
tack off by scoring in the first ten
seconds. 0n the next play Malo-
ney fouled Osborne and she tallied.
Tilden and “Ozzie” matched bas-
kets. Michael missed a foul shot
and Tilden scored on the rebound.
On a nice set-up, Quinn tallied and
then added a foul shot. Seymour
sent one through the hoop, and
“Ozzie” matched her two points.
Seymour made a basket and Tilden
added a foul shot as the quarter
ended with Phi Delt ahead, 9-8.
Both teams were scoring with ease
in this period as the defense was
lacking for the squads.

Phi Delt’s defense tightened and
Gamma Kap could do little to hold
them down. Tilden and Michael
each sent one through the hoop
but were matched by Quinn's bas-
ket and foul shot. Tilden tallied a
basket and Gamma Kap tried to
tighten its defense. Seymour toss-
ed a long one through, and Young
scored. Ozzie and Michael tallied
for their respective teams and Ti!-
den, receiving the ball from Sey-
mour, tallied. Time was called by
the referees. Seymour and Tilden
each pushed two points through,
and Michael added a foul shot as
the quarter ended with Phi Delt
way out in front 26-15.

Michael scored a basket, Quinn
tallied twice, and on a nice play
through center Seymour added two
more points. Michael scored two
foul shots and Young retailiated
with a basket and a foul shot as
the quarter ended 32-24 in Phi
Delt's favor. The teams were even-
ly matched in this quarter and sev-
eral jump-ups were called.

Quinn scored on a lay-up as the
quarter started. Tilden tallied and
Young matched her basket with a
one-hander from the side. In rapid
succession Tilden and Seymour tai-
licd and Quinn put in a foul point.
A double foul was called on Seymour
and Winters. Seymour made her
point and Quinn matched it. Time
was called.

Seymour made and missed foul
shots as the game continued. Pedi-
sich fouled Michael, and as this
was her fourth foul. Egan took her
place. Young tallied and on a play
through center Seymour scored.
The whistle blew as Ozzie pushed
the last basket through, giving Phi
Delt the game and the champion-
ship 42-34. The combination of
Tilden. Seymour. and Michael in
the forward spots, and Maloney,
Vernoy and Striphas in the guard
positions were too much for Gamma
Kap’s fast moving team.

In the first game of the evening
betwocn Psi Gum and BK. Sowa was
high scorer for the losers and Bak~
er. with 8 points, high scorer for
the Madison Ave. team.

The first quarter was sprinkled
with brilliant playing. both offense
and defense, on the puff. of the Psi
(lam team. With Sewn and Leng-
ye! scoring and Sweeney stopping"
the lJllllllCl‘ passes Psi Gum pushed
ahead 0-4 as the period ended.

Traditional Rivalry Bowling
Set For Today At Playdium

The rivalry bowling matches
will be played off this afternoon
at the Piaydium Bowling Alleys
at 3 :30 P. M.

As yet the teams of both ’48

and ’49 are tentative. The frosh
have narrowed the field of try-
outs for the girls down to six.
They are Audrey Adolphson, E1-
eanor Ames, Dorothy Anderson,
Louise Cargill, Mary Jane Peris,
and Beverly Sittig. The men
who are going to bowl for ’49
have not yet been chosen. The
’48ers have had quite a time
narrowing down their teams to
the limited five. So far Mar-
garet Ardito, Alice Fisher, Mary
Regan, Claire Sylvestri, and
Eloise Worth, make up the
Sophomore team. The Daffies
are all out with their men bowl-
ers. John Bolles, Marty Bort-
nick, Fran Mullin, Henry Far-
ley, and Paul Wagner comprise
their team.

From the results of Wednes-
day's practice bowl, the fresh
have a slight edge on the Sophs.
But from the Sophs scores from
last year the Devils will have-
more than a comfortable share
of competition.

WAA Doubles

Nearing Finals
In Table Tourney

The WAA doubles ping-pong
tournament has been making con-
siderable progress. Four out of five
matches have been played off in
the first round and by the begin-
ning of next week the second round
should be well under way.

In the first frames, Alice Fisher
and Ray Weiss defeated Judy Fen-
enback and Mary Steinbach, Betty
Jane Jones and Mary Alice Dines
won over Jean Harris and Midge
Groesbeck, Jean Conner and Tess
Mahoney lost to Sylvia Fisher and
Helen Lengyel, and Wilma Whitney
and Tess Salomone bowed to Fran
Sewer and Adeline Fischer. The
Collier-Dube and O’Grady-Wakin
match remains to be played yet in
the first round.

Bertha Wakin, ’47, captain of the
sport, asks that all the participants
in the tournament play their
matches on time, in order to finish
the tourney before the end of the
season.

Credit for the sport may be ob-
tained and used towards an award
in WAA. Hours other than those
acquired through tournament; par-
ticipation are necessary to gain the
credit.

By FRANK WOODWOBTH

Agitation seems to be the driving
force of this column, so this week
We have something that we think
is worth your serious consideration.
The idea was brought up this Week
in MAA Council meeting and we de-
cided to place it before the student
body for approval.

State has needed a general recre-
ation place where students could go
on dates, or othrewise on weekends.
Under present conditions we feel
that the Commons is the logical
spot for informal weekend get-to-
gethers. Students could dance,
play bridge, ping-pong, or just re-
lax. Open nights would be arranged
so as not to conflict with school
functions. We are quite certain
that the faculty would be glad to
be ohaperones for these events be-
cause they too know that outside
recreational facilities in Albany are
not desirable for the most part.

Another strong argument for this
arrangement is the expense of rec-
reation in Albany. In this plan the
only possible expense involved
would be for the janitor.

Of course, this plan like anything
else would fall through if the stu-
dents failed to support it after the
novelty wore off. At any rate, we
think that. it would be worth a try.
Intramural Softball

Plans for the coming softball sea-
son are still in the embryonic stage
because there is so much indecision
concerning the make-up of the
teams. This is a problem because
we do not have organized group
houses or fraternities as we did be-
fore the war. Also we are not sure
of arranging teams because we do
not know in some cases whether or
not fellows are physically able to
play. Until we can find the an-
swers to this problem we will not be
able to arrange a schedule.

Softball Smalltalk

This is partially in reply to Jinny

Day’s column in which she stated
that “at least the girls admit that
they’re stiff, aching, and practically
unconscious this week . . ." Our
answer to this statement is that we
did not have to admit anything; it
showed all over us. Mute testimony
is sometimes the most effective.
Intramural Council
We have referred above numerous
times to the Men’s Athletic Associa-
tion Council. Perhaps it would be
well to explain the nature and
function of the council. Its pur-
pose is for the arrangement of the
expanding athletic program. For
the sake of better organization it
was decided that the council should
be divided into committees, each to
perform a specific function. The
council is made up as follows:
President—Hal Weber.
Secretary—John Boiles.
Treasurer—Bob Nichols.
Varsity sports—Red Evans.
Intramural sports—Bill Marsland,
Tom Feeney, Frank Woodworth.
Publicity-~r—Phil Lashinsky.
PfAffl'illlg‘l‘lltt‘llls—MBOb Sullivan, Curt
ll .

 

Baker pushed BZ’s score to 19
points while the guards allowed Psi
Gain to score only one point.

In the last quarter the Psi Gains
tried desperately to score, but to no
avail. as the game ended with BZ
on the winning side. 22-11.

lniersororiiy Rouncl Robin Dance

Will Preface Junior Weekend

Traditions come and go—lnld in
the cycle, the Round Robin Dances
appear on the scene again for the
first Lillie since the Fall of '42.
Inter-Sorority Council will sponsor
the comeback as part. of the Big 8
scrics and the Junior Weekend on
Friday. April 26, from 8:00 to 12:00
P. M.

in a flashback to years gone by——
in '30. a part of the big Senior
Weekend was the already traditional
Round Robin Sorority Dances on
the night. before the Senior Hop.
Two o'clock. hours for the girls pre-
vailed. with dancing from 9:00 to
1:00. and it was a strictly sorority
affair . . . no independents allowed.
In April. '41, the annual affair went
high but with tails and formula in
demand for the sorority open houses.

The Ali~State Weekend took the
place of the Senior Hop in '42. To
conlplete the weekend, the seven
sororities on campus held their
house dances. Those Were the
pahny days when some of the
houses hired orchestras while oth-
ers stuck to the via. Game '43, and
‘lntcrfratcrnity Council sponsored
the lust affair before the war. flours
were no longer a question. for the
dances were held in the afternoon.
Then, along with the man shortage.
or maybe, because of it, the Round
Robin Dances faded into the past.

Remembrance of things past will

shift. to anticipation of things to
collie as Inter-Sorority Council pre-
sents the scvvnth Big 8, and starts
off a gala Junior Weekend.

Girls who are lucky enough to
have dates for the prom can surely
persuade their males to arrive a day
earlier if they 001110 from out of
town. Because the dances are
sponsored by the sororities. girls are
expected to make the dates—one
time that the girls can take over
the business end of the deal.

For a more fifty cents. a couple
may make the rounds of all the
sororlty houses on campus. 'A typi-
cal itinerary might include: start-
ing off at Chi Sig on Madison for
a couple of dances, then under the
secret passage to BZ and refresh-
lnehts before the trek over to Quail
and Gamma Kap for some more
dancing. Doubling back to Phi Delt
on Myrtle or Psi Gum on South
Lake will provide opportunities to
sample different refreshments and
prepare for the journey out to AE
Phi on Washington or KD on West-
ern. On second thought. maybe a.
bus ride would be easier on the
feet. At AE Phi a couple hands of
bridge will finish out the evening.

Joyce MacDonald, '40, President
of Inter-Sorority Council, is general
chairman of the affair, and tickets
may be obtained from Jean Whit-
ney, '40.

Kiefer To Play

In Pierce Halli

Pages Will Herald
Entrance Cl Queen

After a lapse of three years, the
traditional Junior Prom will be
held Saturday, April 27, in the Ingle
Room at Pierce Hall and the gym
at Sayles Hall from 9 to 1 A. M.
At the stroke of midnight, a Junior,
chosen as the most beautiful in the
class. will be crowned Queen of the
Coronation Ball. Marian Vitullo is
general chairman of the event.

The Junior Class will vote for the
Queen today in Assembly. Those
nominated include Marty Dunlay,
Mary Harvey, Jean Hembury, Sally
Johnson, Gertrude Kasper, Mary
Reynolds, and Edna Sweeney. The
identity of the Queen will be a
closely guarded secret until her en-
trance at midnight. Seven candl-
dates were nominated this year in-
stead of the usual five because of a
three way tie among the last three
nominees. This will necessitate the
elimination of two nominees as at-
tendants to the Queen.

Music by Tommy Kiefer

Music for the dance will be furn-
ished by Tommy Kiefer and his or-
chestra. He will play in the Ingle
Room, while music at Sayles will be
provided by the via. There will be
a boardwalk between the We dorm-
itories which will be illuminated by
spotlights.

At midnight, in the Ingle Room,
a blare of trumpets will mark the
entrance of last year’s Junior
Queen, Genevieve Stiles, and two
attendants. They will proceed to
the stage and after another blare
of the trumpets, the Prom Queen
will appear with her two attendants.
After the Queen has reached the
stage, she will be crowned with a.
tiara of flowers by Miss Stiles. Fol—
lowing this, the escorts of the queen
and her attendants. will dance the
Coronation Waltz.

Coronation Decorations

Decorations will consist of light
green and pink streamers surround-
ing the Queen's throne. There will
be a red carpet on the steps lead-
ing to the throne and pink and
green streamers will come from each
chandelier to meet at a point in
the center of the ceiling. A canopy
of pink and green will decorate the
entrance to the Ingle Room.

Clnlperones chosen for the even-
ing include Dr. Louis C. Jones, Pro-
fessor of English, and Mrs. Jones,
Dr. Harvey R. Rice. Professor of
Social Studies, and Mrs. Rice, Dr.
Ralph G. Clauscn, Professor of Bi-

lan Hicks, Professor of Guidance,
