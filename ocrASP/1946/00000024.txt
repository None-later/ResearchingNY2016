Congratulations! A moi: Enjoy-

? meetings at~‘200.~ Is this a new power of Student able evening:

“Couﬁéilii'Fiom “Which of its delegated powers does
‘itireceive.the'authority to set a quorum for a Stu-
. dent Assdciatim assembly? We feel that Student
Council has over-stepped its power. I .

Robert’s Rules of Order states: “The quorum

Wednesday night Harold Gould
again proved that he is a master
of burlesque. Joseph Palevsky and
Gloria Jaffer are good seconds. Two
distracting elements were overcome

of any other deltbratme assembly with an enrolled by the sheer foolishness __ garbled

membership (unless the by-laws provide for a
smaller quorum) is a majority of all the members.”
The by-laws of the Student Association Constitu-

‘ tion do not provide for a quorum; obviously, unless
otherwise decided by the asSembly as a whole, the
quorum is a majority of the enrolled members.
Beside the fact that it is illegal for one group

to set a quorum for another, a quorum of 200

' seems ridiculously low. The enrolled membership

of Student Association is approximately 1100. If
200 students turn out for one of these special as-
semblies, a simple majority will be 101——-and a
isimple majority is all that is required to pass any
of the parts of the revised Constitution. Any small
pressure-group, any faction upholding special in-
:lerests, could pass a motion in the name of the
‘ entire Association.

Final voting on the entire Constitution will take
place in a regular business meeting. A 2/3 vote is
then required to pass the Constitution. A section
of the Constitution that was passed by 101 mem-
bers at a special meeting may not be passed by 2/3
of the full group. This will mean that another
discussion will have to take place and another
vote taken.

One of the most important items in the revised
Constitution is still to be discussed. This is prefer-
ential voting. The new method of proferential vot-
ing requires an accuate and complete explanation.
If 101 members accept or reject it, are the rest
of the students to follow along abediently like a
flock of sheep? The student body cannot, with in-
tellectual honesty, pass the Constitution unless
it has a complete knowledge and understanding
of each section of the Constitution, including that
on preferential voting! Anything as important as
voting should be discussed by the entire student
body, and voted upon by the entire student body.

The idea of having special meetings to complete
discussion of the Constitution was an excellent
and efficient idea. The quorum, however, should
be either a majority of the enrolled members, or
"should be set by the Student Association itself, and
the quorum should be large enough so that any
vote taken will represent a satisfactory cross-sec-
tion of the student body. If special meetings are
held, each member of Student Association should
realize his personal obligation to attend these meet-
mgs.

Granted that the Constitution is important, and
that, if possible, it should be passed this semester.
Let us not pass it haphazardly, or in haste, how-
ever. We are taught that nothing is indispensable—
if the Constitution is not passed this semester,
State could probably manage to exist until first
semester of next year at which time discussion
could be continued in an intelligent and adult
manner.

Homogenous Grouping, that is
ONCE UPON A TIME . . .

there was a little girl. Her name
was Hepzlbah Peabody, and she was
five years old. On the day of reg-
istration, Mrs. Peabody, mother of
Hepzlbah, brought her daughter to
school to be homogeneously group-
e As they entered the building
which was Public School Number
Forty-Four (and a fourth), Mrs.
Peabody carried her daughter Hep-
zlbuh over the threshhold into the
office of Miss Minnie Slotkin. Miss
Minnie Slotkin was the principal,
and she wore white angora knee
socks. Hepzlbah did not like white
angora knee socks. Hepzlbah did
not like Miss Slotkln.

“Say hello to Miss Slotkln,” said
Hepzibah‘s mother.

“ elio to Miss Slotkln,” said Hep-
zlbah.

“Hepzlbah,” said Miss Slotkln,
rubbing her knee socks the wrong
way, “you are not hep.” And she
grouped Hepzlbah homogeneously
with the retarded kindergarteners.
Hepzlbah did not like being grouped
homogeneously. Hepzibah did not
like being a retarded kindergartcner.

In the advanced intelligent kin-
dergarten section, thought. Hepzl-
bah, they probably did lots of ad-
vanced-intelligent things, but here,
in the retarded kindergarten sec-
tion. it was all very dull and strictly
a matter of routine. Every morn-
ing they came into the classroom
and Miss O'Snyctinyousee, the
teacher, played “Welcome, Sweet
Springtime," on the piano. Then
they sang, “Good Morning, Dear
'l‘cnchcr,” bollywoppcd down the
slide, \vovo straw baskets, and strung
colored bonds until Ton o’Clock ro-
coss. At. Ton o‘CIOck recess, 11 tall
skinny boy from Norman's Kill coffin
in and sold nickel bottles of Homo-
geneoused Milk which Hepulbah
drank through a macaroni named
Mlnnlo (in honor of Miss Slot-kin).
After the milk, Miss O'Saycanyousce
passed out little rag rugs. “Now,”
leored Miss O'Saycnnyousee, "let us

all curl up in our little rag rugs and
take a nap.” Hepzibah always won~
dered why Miss O'Saycanyouetcetra
didn’t curl up in a little rag rug and
lie on the floor too, but she was
afraid to ask. She just rolled her-
self lnto a little ball inside her lit-
tle raggedy rag rug, squeezed her
beady eyes shut, and made believe
she was sleeping. After an hour
spent in this crippling position, she
heard "Welcome, Sweet Springtime"
played on the piano again. This
was the signal to unroll and start
functioning retardedly again. So
they unrolled and started functioning
retardedly again. They bellywopped
down the slide, and wove straw bas-
kets. and strung colored beads.

After one month of this nonsense,
Hepzibah made a very startling an-
nouncement in class, “1.” she said
proudly, cracking her knuckles in
Miss O‘Saycanyousee's direction,
“refuse to be a damn beadstringer
for one minute longer.” And she
dropped her equipment and left the
room.

If she couldn’t be an advanced-
lntelllgcnt kindergartener, thought
Hepzlbah to herself. she wouldn't
be a klndergartener at. all. She
would go out and get married. These
and various other evil thoughts
sifted through Hepzlba'h’s little sup-
posedly retarded brain as she walk-
cd across the hall to the advanced
klndergartcncr’s side. Now she
would see how the other half lived!
Quietly she opened the door and,
unnoticed, she stood in the doorway
and watched. This was the moment
she had been waiting for. She was
getting a chance to see the advanc-
cd-lnielllgcnt pupils at work. Quick-
ly Hopzlbah surveyed the room, and
after a glance, her eyes opened wide
with wonder and amazement. Here,
in the class for uthnnccd-intelligcnt
klndcrguricncrs, the kids were
grouped about the room, and with
their brilliant llttlo faces and bands
they were . . . bollywopplng down
the slide, and weaving straw bus-
kcts, and stringing colored beads.

Hepzibah was very disappointed.

D&A is also to be congratulated for refusing to
sell reserve tickets to this performance. This is
something for Which State students have been fight-
ing for years, and at last one Council in college
has had the courage to take a chance and sell gen-
eral admission tickets only. Consequently, it was
a case of “first-come, first-served,” and the student
body had an opportunity to get some of the best
seats in the house.

. . . The Religious Clubs for accepting the sug-
gestion made by the STATECOLLEGE NEWS to spon-
sor the campaign for canned goods for French stu-
dents. The drive is over, and several cartons of
canned goods are waiting to be shipped to France.
This campaign has shown the ability of the Relig~
ious Clubs to work together as one unit, and has
given State students an opportunity to show good-
will to their foreign colleagues.

Another vote of thanks goes to these organiza-
tions for the cooperative Religious Ciubs’ tea that
they sponsored last Sunday. More social affairs of
this type would stimulate a better and more united
campus spirit, particularly if more than the usual
handful of students attended!

Traditions Triumph! . .

Traditions are the essence of life—in traditions
lie the beauty and memories of college years. Lack-
ing them, there is progress in scholarship without
the parallel progress in humanity.

During the weekend of April 26, two former State
College traditions, temporarily suspended during
the war, are being revised by the Junior Class and
Intersorority Council.

On April 27, the Junior Class is sponsoring the
Junior Prom, and as a part of it, the Coronation
of the Junior Queen. This will be the first time
this has occurred in three years. Another tradi-
tion hinging on the tradition of the Junior Prom
is 3 o’clock hours. Few State students have forgot-
ten the thrill received when he read in the Fresh-
man Handbook in the section discussing hours:

“After any formal State College dances—Junior
Prom, Sophomore Soiree, lnterfraternity Ball, In-
tersorority Ball and Senior Prom—students who
attend these dances must be in their houses by
3:00 AM.”

Well, the Junior Prom is back again! Will the
rest of the statement hold true?

The other “brought-back” tradition is the In-
tersorority Round Robin Dance the night before
the Junior Prom. Sororities and fraternities often
held impromtu Round Robins in the pre-war years.
Intersororiiy Council has decided to revive this
tradition as its annual Big 8. The idea is excel-
lent and promises to be completely successful. There
is, of course, one requirement that is essential for
success . . . and that is, that sorority girls and
independents forget their affiliations for the night
and travel around to all of the houses.

College spirit, social life. and timeless traditions
are finding their way back into State once more.
Junior Week-end, with old memories renewed, is
the harbinger of good news. The response and c0—
operatioh of all the students to the events of this
weekend will determine whether or not State is
still willing to accept ti few of the little things that
make life better than mere existence.

WAA Softball

 Begin Seo'son
After Vacation

Izhsoftba‘ll season has rolled around
once again. The same old problem
of rainy weather seems to be domin-
a‘nt- once again this year. The first
practice was scheduled for last
Monday, but due to a change in the
weather, official practice did not
get underway until Wednesday.

.Marjorie O'Grady, ’47, and Peg
,aly, ’48, co-captains of softball,
have announced that practice on
the dorm field will continue after
Easter vacation. On Monday and
Wednesday, practice will begin at
3:30 and last until 5. On Fridays
it will begin an hour earlier at 2:30
and continue until 5.

Houses Respond

A league is already in the process
of formation. So far Pierce, Sayles,
Stokes, and the Whiz Kids are the
only group houses handing in a list
of their players. It. is hoped that
enough interest will be shown to
make the softball league as success—
ful as the basketball league turned
out to be.

Afternoon practices are general
and it is not necessary to play on
a team in order to get credit in
softball. Ten hours at practice is
necessary to get WAA credit. Two
hours at the field on the same day
will be counted as two hours credit.
Rivalry Game

The rivalry softball game is sched-
uled for some time shortly after
Easter vacation. It is a little too
soon to start any predictions, but
Judging from last; year’s game, the
frosh had better get to work. The
Sophomores will be spark-plugged
by such stars as Diehl, Rand, Syl-
vestri, Tilden and Daly. So far,
the frosh turn out has been very
slight.

Judging from the little time they
have had to show off their talent,
it looks as if Joslin, Lytle, Whelly,
Ineson, Hawkins, Fltzmorris and
Midgley are a few who will repre-
sent ’49.

LaSalle Defeats

State Fencers

Meeting the LaSalle Junior Var-
sity fencing squad on Saturday, the
WAA foilsmen lost the match by a
7-5 score. This marked the second
encounter with the LaSalle fencers.
In their first match of the year, the
WAA fencers defeated the LaSalle
Freshman squad by an 8-6 score.

In the opening match of the
morning, Peggy Eggert, '48, State's
captain. defeated the LaSaIle cap-
tain by two points. In the match
which followed, June Fabric, '48, was
unable to successfully parry the ex-
cellent work of the second LaSalle
fencer. Mickey Seaman. '49, lung-
ed her way to a victory over her
opponent while Anne Soullch, ’49,
fencing in her unique “Corncl
Wilde" style, lost to her tricky La-
Salle opponent. However. State
soon lost its lead in thc completion
of the first round when Pctrie, Eg-
gert, Seaman and Soulich succes-
sively lost the next four matches.

State Scores

The second of the two rounds
which comprised the bout got 011
to a fast start when Molly. Whollcy,
’49. displayed cxil'omo agility with
the foil to defeat. the LaSulle entry.
Using her left. handed method of
attack, Mui‘lc Fernandez, ’49, addc
another fully to the State. score. In
the final two mntchcs, Mary Ellen
Dinner, ’47. split hor matches, win-
nlng in the first with n skillful dis-
pliiy of fine fencing form, and los—
ing lln' second by the narrow nuii'gm
of 5-4.

Fresh Women Score
lter Soph Men Win

The rivalry bowling matches
which took place last Friday at the
Playdium resulted in a" tie for
polnts. The Soph men won their
two games but the Soph women
dropped their matches.

The highest game was 238 by
Wagner, ’48. who hit eight consecu-
tive strikes. Bortnick rolled 203. In
the other match Rerris. '49, hit 168
and Yerdon 149.

Games Tied

In the men’s game the dailies
were far superior to the devils as
they won the first game by 143 and
the second by 167 pins.

In the women’s matches the first
game was won by over a hundred
pins while the second was lost by
the Sophs by only 43 pins.

Points Added

This way the Sophs and frosh
each added three points to their
rivalry score.

MAA Softball
Still In Oiling

Last Wednesday MAA held a. bus-
iness meeting where plans for the
present softball season were discus-
sed. A tentative basketball sched-
tile for next year was also consid-
ered.

The softball season is calendared
to start immediately after the
spring recess. The tournament is
to be an intramural affair. the
teams being Seniors, Juniors, Soph-
omores and freshmen. There is to
be a game every afternoon at 4:15,
Monday through Thursday on Page
Field. If the game is rained out or
for some other reason cannot be
played on the scheduled day. it will
be played the following day in a
double-header.

Letters Written

MAA has written several letters
to other colleges in the State con-
cerning basketball games for next
year. So far, Oswego and St. Ml-
chucl‘s are the only two that have
returned an affirmative answer. The
matches are worked on the two-year
basis whereby the visiting school is
assured $100 if a return match at
their own college is not played that
your.

The budget of $4.600 has been ap-
proved by the Student Board of
Finance but must still come up be—
fore the student body.

After much argument and inde-
cision a 301th schedule is finally
getting underway. It was de-
cided to organize the teams along
class lines. Due to present housing
conditions it is next to impossible
to set up beams in any other way.
Under the present system the Junior
Class would seem to have a decided
advantage while the Senior Class
may have difficulty in filling out a
squad. A possible solution to this
problem would be to select certain
members of the Junior Class who
have advanced credit to put them
ahead of the other Juniors and yet
not enough credits to be considered
Seniors; these men to play on the
Senior team. Another solution would
be to combine Seniors and Grads in
the event that the Grads do not
have a complete team.

It is our sincere ambition to make
the arrangement of teams as fair
as possible because we feel that
there will be more interest if the
teams are fairly matched. No one
wants to play on a team that has

_ a slim chance of winning due to

poor organization of the league. On
the other hand, there is no sport
derived from playing teams that do
not offer sufficient competition.

Lists Posted

There are five lists posted on the
MAA bulletin board according to

' classes. Please sign the lists under

the class that you are actually in
with respect to school requirements.
That is, if you lack the required
hours to be classed as a Soph, even
though you are taking some Soph
courses, sign under the Frosh list.

The following men are responsible
for the organization of each team.
Grads . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .. Jim Crandell
Seniors  Bob Sullivan
Juniors .. .. Al Stone
Sophs . . John Bolles
Frosh  .... .. Bob Nichols

If you are at all interested, sign
one of the lists. Do not sign unless
you intend to play. We want to get
the schedule underway immediately
following Easter vacation so do not
hesitate.

Recreation Opportunity

Combined efforts of MAA and
WAA have resulted in the advance-
ment of plans for opening of the
Commons on open dates between
now and graduation. The Admin-
istration was consulted and our plan
has been approved. There are still
some minor problems to erase but
these are merely functional and will
not constitute a. barrier. Therefore,
the success or failure of this plan
depends entirely upon the reaction
of the students. If we find that
only a few people will take advant-
age of this opportunity. it will not
be worthwhile to continue it.

Probably there will be less enthu—
siasm at this time of year, especially
as fast time will go into effect short-
ly after we return from vacation.
During the winter months we are
driven inside for our recreation and
it follows that this plan Would be
most beneficial at that time.

Rivalry Contest

The Sophomores gave a deoisiva
exhibition of ping-pong superiority
Wednesday afternoon when they
added two more points to their. riv-
alry score by copping all six of the
singles contests. The points were
to be awarded. to the class that won
five of the nine scheduled matches,
each match to be decided by two
out of three games.

The men’s singles were played off
early in the afternoon. Bob Bowe,
’49, lost two successive games to
Paul Wagner, ’48, to the tune of 21-
12 and 21-15. The Mullen-Bortnick
clash was a closer match. Mullen
won the first 21-11 but Bortnick
came back in the second for a deuce
game. losing finally 24-2’.

Women’s Singles

If the frosh women had been able
to hold the Sophs down to only two
of the four women's singles they
might have been able to postpone
what seemed to be a certain Soph
victory until the doubles were plays
ed off. But. lady luck and champion
players were on the other side. In
the first tile Mary Cheatham bowed
to Adeline Fischer 21-7 and 21-15.

The first game between Judy Fen-
enbock and Alice Fisher raised the
fresh hopes high. Fenenbock took
an early lead and held it until vic-
tory was in sight. But like the
Mullen-Bortnick contest the deuce
game ended in ’48's favor 24-22. The
second game was Fisher's all the
way through and the final score
was 21-11.

Decisive Game

Ray Weiss won the decisive match
for the Sophs by downing Arlene
Zeilengold 21-10 and 21-9. The last
singles contest was between Fran
Sowa and Jean Harris. Again the
Sophomore won 21-11 and 21-12.
The balance of the scales was in
’48's favor all the way since both
of the present holders of the sin-
gles titles and their closest compet-

itors in the race for the champion- i

ship are members of the Sophomore

class.

Several people have mentioned
the fact that they were happy for
the two weeks during which tithe
this column was taken over by other
members of the sports department.
Now, they stated that they would
begin to worry and stew again won-
dering what was going to be in the
column on Friday. Well sleep tight,
hold tight or what have you . . .
fear no more! From here on in we
will endeavor to make every mm
to keep these attempts from degen-
erating into anything resembling a
personal column—that is really not
what we are trying to (lo—believe
it. or not. The only purpose we had
in doing anything of that sort was
inject some humor into the every-
day llfe here at school. Relatives
and otherwise — please accept our
apologies.
