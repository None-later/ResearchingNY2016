“O!” cried Betty Rose Dia-

“But the books were donated to

fell.)

"HOWever," she added encour-
agingly,” Russia didn’t want it.”

A cloud appeared on the pro-

“Where is it?" he asked hope-
fully.

“We sold it,” came the glib
reply.

So Dr. Jones’ En 230 students

 :—HeterogeneousGrouping

' In reply to the question, "Do you
believe that’sehools should segreg
gate students according to their
level of intelligence into~groups of:
A's, B’s, and 0’s," asked in a recent
News Poll the general concensus
seemed to. favor heterogeneous
grouping. Only Seniors and Juniors
were approached, because it was
felt that the freshmen and Sopho«
more classes were not qualified to
answer. Seniors have done or are.

Juniors have two years of Ed 10
plus methods to back up their ideas.

The most common answer was, “It
causes complexes. The A group
feels superior and the C group in«-
ferior.” As Barbara Reiff, ’46, said,

‘ “It makes for an ‘I’m in upper first

and you’re only in lower first’ atti-
tude." One student remarked, “It
forms an uppercrust of intelligence."
Many thought it was an undemo-
cratic procedure giving way to bul-
lying and snobbishness. Another
point mentioned was the danger of
the social attitudes which might
develop from such a situation. Many
thought that if segregation was car-
ried out, there would be a tendency
for the whole school to go back-
wards socially. Catherine Guido,
’47, added that in a mixed class the

the higher intelligence seem as son
cial life went; thus compensating
for their lower marks. Eleanor Dur-
beck, '46, summed up her thoughts
with, “It creates social frustration.”

A few opinions were offered from
a teacher’s point of view. “Segre-
gation is just an easy way out for
the teacher,” stated Nona Vimmer-
s'tedt, ’47, and one of the Seniors
remarked that such a situation of-
fered no challenge to the teaching
profession. Betty Rose nut, ’47,
thought that teachers could spon-
sor individual work in the class-
room to aid the A group. MlSS Hilt
felt that the advantages of indivi-
dual work outWeighed the benefits
of segregation.

Some of the students made re-
marks to the effect that such a
practice would be undemocratic.
Ruth Bentley, '47, stated that the
purpose of education was to pre-
pare the students for life, and seg-
regation creates an unreal situa-
tion. Joseph Palevsky, ’46, felt
that it was unfair to the students
because in later life they would not
always be working with people of
their own level of intelligence. They
must learn to live and associate with
all different types of people. One

idea brought up by Ada Jane Mar;
tin, '47, was "It its more important
to have children of like emotional
age tugether rather than like intel.
lectual age." 

Molly Kramer, ’47, summed up
the feelingsof those on the negative

side when she said, “Segregation.

tends to hurt some of the students,
and that is not the,purpose of edu!
cation." Only nine of the fifty peo-
ple questioned answered in the af-
firmatlve. Some felt it would de-
pend upon the size of the school be-
cause in larger schools segregation
might successfully be carried out
without the students’ knowledge.
Some felt that in certain subjects
like mathematics and science segre-
gation was imperative. In these
courses it was felt that the higher
level students were retarded and
the lower level students didn’t learn
enough to warrant this holding
back. Others felt that segregation
would offer an opportunity to train
the slower students.

According to the poll, the students
questioned disagree with the segre-
gation policy. The general trend of
thought seems to be that it would
cause too many complexes and oth-
er psychological pitfalls.

Intersorority Council will open
Junior Week-end tonight with a
Round Robin Dance from 8 to 12
PM. Anita Pedisich, '46, is in charge
of arrangements for the dance which
constitutes the seventh Big-8.

Vic Party

Each of the seven sororities will
have a vic party in its house and
couples will travel from house to
house during the evening. Refresh-
ments consisting of coke and cookies
will be served at each stop.

The cost of the affair will be fifty
cents per couple which entitles
them to the use of all seven sorority
houses. Although the dance is
sponsored by Intersorority Council,
it is not a sorority affair and all in-
dependents al'e urged to attend.

Jean Whitney, ’46, is in charge of
tickets and each sorority has one
person in charge of tickets and one
in charge of house arrangements.
These respective committee heads

Sigma Theta, Anne Donavon and

Renew Tradition

The sorority Round Robin Dance
is another of State’s traditions
which terminated as a result of the
war. This is the first dance of this
sort since the fall of ’42. lntersor-
ority Council sponsored the dance as
their contribution to the Big-8 pro-
gram to fill out the Junior Week-
end.

Joyce MacDonald. President of
lntersorority Council, has asked that
all those who attend circulate among
the sorority houses and not remain
at one place all evening.

Last Wednesday, the Temporary
Judicial Board held its first meeting
to elect officers and to provide for
the general organization of the
Board. This Board was voted into
existence by a motion passed the
Fr.day before Spring vacation, be-
cause of the dissolution of Mys—
knnia. the former judiciary body of
State College. The purpose of the
Board is to carry on the duties of
the former Myskania. and to submit
a list of ten names to Student Asso-
ciation for approval for membership
on the 1946—1947 Judiciary Body.

The twelv-e Seniors who have ac-
cepted positions on the Board are
Harriet Brinkman, Georgette Dunn,
Jean Griffin, Betty Hamilton, Pris-
cllla Hayes, Josephine Maggie,
Gloria McFerran, Joseph Palevsky,
Shirley Passow, Mary Seymour.
Helen Shure, and Mary Straub. At
the Wednesday meeting. Miss Grif-
fin was elected Chairman; Miss Mc-
Ferran, Secretary; Miss Hayes,
Treasurer; and Miss Dunn, Publicity
Director. Mis's Seymour was ap-
pointed Chairman of Rivalry.

Evidently the following classes
decided that the practice of choos-
ing the most beautiful and popular
girl of the class to reign at their
annqu ball should be added to the
long list of college traditions, and
today the high point of the Junior
Prom is the coronation of the queen.

In 1935, the coronation of the
queen took place serenely on sched-
ulc in spite of the serious handicap
of the Very late arrival of the or-
chestra engaged for the evening.
That was a bull unique in the an-
iiiils of Junior Proms. In '87, the
best reason for going to the prom
was givon by a former queen. Said
she, “It will be a crowning situa-
tion.” Can you imagine how the
