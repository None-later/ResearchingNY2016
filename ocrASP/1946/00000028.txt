a majority of Student Association)

bly as to how Myskania should be
selected. We should like to sum-
marize the arguments given on both
sides so that this controversy will
take its place in the history of State
College Student Government. These
arguments are listed as objectively
as possible. _

Justification for changing
Myskania’s method of selec-
tion:

1. That since Myskania is a part
of student government at State and
is so listed in the Student Associa-
tion Constitution, Student Associa-
tion has the power at any time to
change Myskania.

2. That in a democratic govern-
ment, the people have the final say.

3,. That the organization is sup-
ported byStudent Association funds
and should therefore be subject to
Student Association control.

Justification given by Mys-
kania for keeping Myskanla
as it has always been:

1. That since Myskania was in ex-
istence before Student Association,
and that since it created Student
Association, not Student Association
it, that, therefore, no one but Mys-
kania could change anything per-
taining to the organization.

2. The Student Association Con-
stitution lists the legislative and
executive branches of the govern-

“All Legislative power shall be
ment thus:
vested in the assembly of the Asso-
ciation."

"Executive power of this Associa-
tion shall be vested in the Student
Council.”

In Article VII, the Constitution
states that “Student Association
recognizes Myskania as a secret.
honorary society the members of
which of chosen in accordance with
its own Constitution." The word

“recognized” is sufficient proof that m Note;

Myskania is not under the control
of Student Association. Also, since
merely recognition (not creation) is
given, when some part of that rec-
ognition is taken, away, the recog-
nition is void unless ratified by the
organization concerned. Therefore.
the omission of the word "secret"
or of the clause “the members of
which are chosen ni accordance
with its own Constitution" would be
changing the type of recognition
without the permission of Myskanln.
and would thus be void.

Arguments given for chang-
ing Myskaniu:

1. It is undemocratic, since it is
self-perpetuating and secret.

2. It's method of selection is open
to corrupt politics because it is a
small group.

3. Leaders should have popular
support in order to work effectively.
Such support can only be obtained
by some type or degree of popular
election.

4. Unless Myskania is chosen by
the student body. it will not have a
sense of responsibility to that or-
ganization.

Arguments against chang-
ing Myskunia:

i. It is undemocratic in theory.
but in practice it is thoroughly dem-
ocrutlc.

2. Any type or degree of popular
election Would not serve as it met-
hod of selection for Mysknnln for
several reasons:

:1. Popular elections are
swayed by political groups.

b. Popular elections would of nec-
essity be based a good deal on the
popularity and personality of this

Herc Recorded

Democratic Plan Stator

ciation shall upon election to oﬂice
automatically become a member of
Myskania.

submit to Student Association a list
of no more than ten individuals rec-
ommended for membership on Mys-
kania by at least a majority of
Myskania. Should more than ten
be able to obtain a majority recom-
mendation, the ten receiving the
highest recommendations shall be
listed.

3. The outgoing Myskania shall
submit to Student Association a list
of all those whom any of its mem-
bers, individually or together, wish
to suggest for consideration for
membership on Myskania. The sug-
gested list shall contain at least
four names, and shall be kept sep-
arate from the recommended list.

4. The recommended and sug-
gested lists together shall contain
no less than fourteen names.

5. Myskania shall publish both
lists at least 18 days before Moving-
Up Day.

6. Members of Student Associa-
tion may, within '7 days, add other

cintion shall, one week before Mov-

9. The members of Student Asso-
ciation shall, one week before Mov-
ing-Up Day. elect by preferential
ballot as many of the nominees of
the suggested list as are needed to
complete the membership of Mys-
knnia.

10. If in any year. selection in ac-
cordance with these provisions does
not result in the selection of 13
members, the Myskania for the next
year shall contain all who have been
selected, and shall have all powers
and duties regularly assigned to it
by this Constitution and its By-
Laws.

11. Any other vacancies on Mys-
kaniu shall be filled in accordance
with the provisions for succession to
office. Myskania suggesting at least

(Bodega Blade-W71
By CULLINAN & HILT

Challenge

Parallellng our nation’s role in the
complex turmoil of reconstruction
and transition is State‘s venture in-
to its new political set-up to be ill-
ouguratcd just one week from today.
As our leaders idealize and formu-
late plans for the future. voices of
disscnsion still rise from discordant
groups. Grave responsibilities must
be shouldered by these loyal citizens
to insure a smooth running, stable
government.

Change without leadership is ruin-
ous, leadership without popular sup-
port is futile. Next week classes will
be moving up and ’46 will be moving
out. Let's keep for them the State
tradition of unity. integrity, and
solidarity
Student Union

Money is the root of all evil but
thch certainly is no evil in pledg—
ing for the Student Union Fund.
Now that pledges are being solicited,
how about reviving the enthusiasm
of the past two years. Many as—
somblics have been devoted to this
question—here‘s hoping they were
not wasted. Syracuse University is
also on the march for a new Stu-
dcnt Union.

DL‘lll' ()ld Dad

Utah has us all bcat according to
lllc College Exchange recently pub-
lisllcd in “The Campus" at Roches-
icr University.

“11' your dad thinks a college cd-
ucuiion is expensive he should try
to find out how Brigham Young
i'ootcd the bill for his children at
lllc Univcl'siiy of Utah.

“Judging from the records in the
chisirur's office. the early Mor-
mon colonizcr should be as famous
for his cduculcd children as for his
mully wivcs. Ill one semester in
1060, Brigham Young was listed as
llli‘ iulhcr of 23 students. Inci-
dcniully. only 150 students were
rcgisicrcd that scmcsicr, so 11 con—
sidcrublc portion oi' the student
body was living under the Young
roof.

As midnight drew near last Satur-
day night. the Green Room at Pierce
Hall became more and more crowd-
ed as couples deserted Sayles to look
for a good position to watch the oil-
max of the evening—the coronation
of the Prom Queen.

After the last dance, just before
midnight. the couples moved back to
form a pathway for the queen and
her court, and the din quieted to a
rustling broken only by a whis-
pered, "Who is it?" Quieter and
quieter—then a trumpet blare broke
the silence as last year's Queen Gen,
wearing a white gown embroidered
with gold sequins, entered, followed
by her attendants Mary Harvey and
Mary Reynolds. Then came this
year’s monarch. Queen Edna I. The
royal purple, ermine trimmed robe
covered her aqua blue gown and
matched her orchid corsage.

As she moved forward regally, the
crowd gave her the traditional ac-
claim of "Long live the Queen!" She
knelt to receive her crown of iris
and cornflowers at the top of the
velvet covered steps and rose to
accept the bouquet of red roses giv-
en by the loyal subjects of her class.
At the close of the impressive cere-
mony she danced the Coronation
Waltz with her escort.

Queen Edna has three firsts to
add to her fame—the first Edna.
the first Prom Queen since ’43, and
ﬁle first redheaded monarch in
Prom History! May her reign be
long and happy.

kania and the Seniors forming a
double line through which each
class passes in order. The freshmen
once more bring up the rear and,
under the constraining care of Cam-
pus Commission. contend for the
pathway and their ribbons through
the lowered archway of Sophomore
hands.

Weather permitting, the classes
will then form their numerals on
the lawn, and when still another ivy
shoot has been added to the climb-
ing vines of other years, the ivy
speaker will address the group. This
will conclude the morning Moving-
Up ceremonies.

In the evening Page becomes again
the scene of action as ’48 and ’49
take their last fling at rivalry with
their skits. The crucial moment
when the winner of the rivalry cup
is announced is deferred until after
the night sing on the steps of Dra-
per.

When the flaming torches of the
Seniors move up Western Avenue,
the Commons will open for dancing,
and all students will be welcome to
drop in on their way either to or
from the unofficial celebration at
“Ackie’s.”
