  for the enlightenment of those
Who may find themselves unduly
troubled by your Thirteen Points.

(Secrns you lost one of them, as well
as Myskanla, since 1917.)

1. Why do our venerable profes-
- sors feel that term papers, long and
short, are the essence and delight
of a State College student’s life?
The fallacy is that we are not ex-
 to—only sadists enjoy sa-
dism; the victims are passive.
‘ 2.a)Why did the Student body of
L 1917 petition the administration for
weekly assemblies. instead of cha-
pel? They were choosing the lesser
of two evils.

1)) Why does the student body of
1946 cut assembly, and show a pro-
found indifference to that which
occurs in Assembly?

it) Even with the new manage-
ment, the Soul is the lesser of the
two evils, or b) You mean you really

 don’t know?

 College a farce diln

p 4. Why have the three crises in
Myskm'la's'f " ' been parallel to
the political or eco-
nomic  crises? This one
took a lot of thought, because I
couldn't find any points in common;
finally I looked up the definition
of parallels—they never meet how-
evertfargtextended. So there should-
nltbemy points, in common, should
then? . .

.5. Why are there fewer candi-
dateskfor Student Association of-
fices‘thall , mylous years? The
return cue. ‘ Iv. enlisted men ap-
parently  uenced many stu-
denpagains't officers.

' {Just what is the definition of
" ocracy"? Now you're getting
lazy; why should I look it up for
you? See Webster.

'1. Why was the last student-fa-
culty tea so poorly attended when
the students have been clamoring
for more student-faculty gatherings?
Because the students like the lem-
ons in their tea, not with it. Or may-
be vice-verse.

«Bil; Why do we so consistently
,ahout “democracy” and then con-
{Zsist'ently ignore the Constitution?
Im't,thie ambiguous? I'm an Eng-
"lish mgjrr, and I insist you cannot
consistently do two things consis-
tently which are so inconsistent.
awry is there such a complete
lack of interest in elections this

To the Editor:

Concerning the Student Union,
so called, will the College get what
it wants in the project or will it
come to the same end as Brubacher
Lounge in Sayles Hall? Several
years ago money was contributed
for furnishing said lounge for‘the
use of all college students for meet-
ings and other get-togethers. Since
that time, the use has become grad-
ually more restricted until it has
reached the point of selling one’s
soul for its use. Its use is practic-
ally forbiden, except for formal af-
fairs or people who apply the right
polish. This lounge was proposed
for and furnished by the students
for their use, yet they are practically
excluded.

The proposed Student Union is to
be built by student funds and fur—
nished and maintained by them.
Will they be able to use it, or will it
be bound up in similar rod-tape?

Moving-Up Day ’46! Perhaps this
is the moment for reminiscing or
predicting but everything seems
over-shadowed by the nearness of
State’s most colorful days. Past
pettiness, conflict, and perverseness
should merge together on this one
day when freshmen, Sophomores,
Juniors, and Seniors move up in
their traditional ceremony. ’Nuff

Are You A Leader?

The question of leadership has
been bashed over a great deal late-
ly. Our friends at Russell Sage
seem to have taken 11 lnore progres-
sive attitude toward this omnipres-
ent topic by recently sponsoring a
leadership conference for all col-
logos in this area enrolling less than
1,000 students. Out-going leaders
of all campus organizations met
with in-comlng leaders to discuss
their current problems. Ill meeting
with these various delegates prom-
inent speakers such as Irving Ives,
former majority leader of the New
York Assembly and present. head
of the Cornell School of Labor, were
obtained to help the students with
these questions.

The conferences were by no moons
restricted to bonds of organiza-
tions but all students Were invited.
even urged to attend. Freshmen
could thus better glean the lllonnlng
of leadership. Sophomores could
become more practical in its appli-

' cation. Junior; might incorporulo its

qualities into specific organizations,
and Seniors might well curry its
true value into their pl'ofcssiotm—-~~
home. business, or community.

of the need for improverner.. Could

TO SING, THAT 18

Tomorrow in Page Hall, after the traditional Moving—Up cere-

mony has been completed, we will,

as usual, all stand, lock arms, and

make the rafters ring with our hearty rendition of “Arm In Arm.”

 

Arsenic Plus
Old Lace Yields
Gay Homicide

From deadly poison to dainty lace
troop the College Playhouse cast in
their annual spring production.
“Arsenic and Old Lace" bOWS into
Page on May 25, creating contrast
between the extremes of love and
murder.

Mortimer (Curt Pfaff) loves
Elaine (Barbara Dunker), (even
across the eerie barrier of a ceme-
tery) and the atmosphere makes a
fitting setting for the gory deeds of
Abby and Martha. These sisters, in
the persons of Alice Prindle and
Marianne Standing, are sweet old
ladies with such a sympathetic slant
that they commit homicide out of
the genuine kindness of their hearts.
The objects of their solicitude are
solitary old bachelors whom they
consider too lonely to live and con-

, sequently comfort with their special

brand of brandy wine.

Tense moments are built up by
the furtive, fearful appearances of
Jonathan (Fred Baron), who is en-
raged by continual references to
himself as Frankenstein. His only
soul mate seems to be Dr. Einstein
(Bill Biasberg), a gentle genius in
plastic surgery.

Teddy (“Proposal” Gould) touches
up the presentation with a bit of
humor in his “Charge!” up San
Juan hill every time he goes to his

“ room, and unwittingly aids his sis-

ters in their weird accomplishments
by digging locks for the Panama
Canal in the cellar. Graves, that it.
With his family overridden with
maniacs, homicidal and harmless,
Mortimcr’s mind becomes a battle-
field bccuusc of his desire to marry
Elaine and the constant dread that
he is tainted with the family ten-
dency.
eventual outcome will be
reached under the direction of Mari-
llllnc Davis, assisted by Grace Jones.

Since all of us know the words
so well (which is obvious from the
volume with which the song is al-
ways sung) it is really not necessary
to print them here. However, in
due consideration to the Mothers
in the audience, who will probably
want to sing along with us, here is
a copy of the refrain. (Cut it out
and give it to Mother, and then, in
case you get nervous and forget
some of the words, maybe she’ll
lend it to you):

N.Y.S.C.T.

Arm in arm thro’ friendly ways,

Press we on these College days,

Common bond we OWe to thee.—
nysct

Stunts and sings and ramny walks,
Frolics, dances, weighty talks,
All of these we owe to thee,

nysct

Eager are we in this youth

Foll’wing wisdomed minds to truth.

Strong old elms will shield no more.

Open roads will stretch before.

Courage we shall gain from thee.

sung at. the end of each stanza.)

PLEA

We have a request from a dc-
formod Grad Student that the rows
please all sway the same way while
they sing. It seems she got. stuck
in the middle of her row each Mov-
ing-Up Dny while she was here, and
the people on opposite sides of her
pulled two different ways and
stretched her out of Sllllllc. (Warn-
