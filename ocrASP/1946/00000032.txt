cross the “Hail” part out of Hail
and FareWell, add it’s been wonder-
ful and there you have it. As this
is our. last issue pardbn if the type
is blurred by salty tears. Next
week’s issue will be taken over by
the new News Board and we will be
out shivering in the cold. Has any-
body an old fur coat they won’t be
using next year? Seriously though,
it certainly has been wonderful
working on Sports Staff all these
years especially with the super staff
this year. We certainly will miss
all these grand kids. It also has
been tops working for you, and try-
ing to make the page something you
would be interested in during the
year. So “thanks for the mem-
ories” . . .

At this point we hear a remark be-
ing made about the Coach, Coach
hathaway that is—to the effect that
things have been running OK. as
long as he is here. Seems with

: most of the fellows who know the
coach, satisfaction is running high.

Also appropriate now would be
a remark about wnat we have been
discussmg around here for a few
days. 'l‘i'llS discussmn concerns WAA
and MAA. We have been advocat-
ing 'a certain amount or coopera-
tion between the two organizations
wnicn would lead to members or
both WAA nad MAA supportmg eacn
other in the various activities they
undertake. One sidengnt of this

. _, could.be .taken under the "Spend

your Friday Evenings In The Com-
monS" concern. This, as we be-
lieve was stated beIore on this page,
was not originally started to be a
"bring your own man, sister, we
have our troubles too,” idea, but
rather an affair where both fellOWS
and girls could go for an evening
of fun and relaxation (that’s a joke
son). Anyway it has been rumored
that there will probably be at least
two more of these get-togethers~—so
how about it kids—Tgrab some laughs
and come along. It should be fun
if more kids come.-

Continuing. with this train of
thought—we would like to get per-
sonal for the last tim (tear, tear).
Some people are reall, slaving for
this idea of cooperation (working
together, that is) and are knocking
themselves out trying to achieve the
sought after goal. In connection with
this, we would like to mention that
one member of the staff was working
rather feverishly Tuesday night and
didn’t even get as far as the tele-
phone number —— which we (ever
ready to lend a helping hand) will
print here—24144. That's O.K. dear
you’re welcome. ~,

Open Letter to the Timid Soul '
Dear Mr. Soul,

Do you have inhibitions—hmlnm’l
Do you have nite mares—(not horses
that is)? Do you find that when'
you really would like to do some-
thing some force beyond your con-
trol thwarts you-—hmmm? Do wom-
en in general bother you? Well,
you're maladjusted brother~-go see
a psychiatrist.

Signed,

An ardent admirer
And if the above refers to you
then don’t stand there with your
mouth open, do something!

In Concluding

Well, that's all folks—~and ill clos-
ing we would like to thank both
WAA and MAA as well as the var-
ious sport captains for the help
they have given us this year. We
wish you luck for next year and
hppe that the organizations will be
as efficiently taken care of next

year.
BYE NOW

By Winning 4 Races

The Sophs boosted their rivalry

' score three more points Wednesday

afternoon winning four of the five
Moving Up Day field events. The
fresh upped their score by one point,
winning but one of the events.

The first race was hte three-leg-
ged race and gained the Sophs V.»
point. Taking part for the Sophs
were Adeline Fischer, Alice Fish-
er, Rand and Tichy, Peckham, Fitz-
morris, Lytie and Seamen ran for
the frosh.

Fellows Even

The fresh and Soph fellows broke
even as each team won one point.
The Soph fellows took baseball and
the frosh came out on top in the
mens relay.

Winning another point for the
Sophs were Tichy and Heglnger who
beat Pecham and Seament in the
bag relay. Still another point was
taken by the Sophs when they won
the volleyball game. On the Sophs
side. Sophs Lavender, Tilden, Heg-
inger and Tichy turned in some
nice playing, while Seamen. Lytie.
Evans and Kloster tried hard for the
frosh.

Spirit Shown

As evidence of some rivalry spirit
1ft at State was the fact that there
was a crowd watching the races.
Since the Sophs did win, there is a
good chance that they have rivalry
for the year. The score so far at
the present time is Sophs 19% to
the froshs 10.

Hawkshaw was at work again this
week. The question: “How can MAA
and WAA develop closer coopera-
tion?” The Order of the Purple Ba-
nana is awarded weekly for the best
answer—This week the medal goes
to Mary Lou Haines for "No com-
ment, I only wanted my name in
the paper." What a question, what
an answer, what intelligence—Oh,
why did I ever leave the farm, Ma?

Now, to get on to some more in—
telligent answers. (That’s no joke
son)

Fran Mullin ’48: “Combined spon-
sorship of events such as dances,
hikes, or a tennis tournament for
the fellas and one for the girls
where the winners of each play each
other. About the gym —— It’s not
trouble with the girls as much as
it is with Milne. When we get the
new gym the matter will be alle-
viated."

Gette Dunn '46: "They could have
closer cooperation by running events
similar to last Friday night for
which committees from both or—
ganizations work together."

Two Sophs. Sowa and Mulroney,
collaborated on this little brain tid-
bit, “Formation of a joint mens
and women‘s sport sport club of
those who are really interested and
able to play. They should have the
unsupervised use of any equipment
of WAA and MAA at all times. This
club should have membership on the
basis of active participation only."
. Red Evans ’47, believes that “there
is the necessary amount of coopera-
tion. The men moved back into
their share of the gym and ulhlclic
facilities with no troublc all all,
something that would not, huvc hap-
pened in the past."

the third consecutive year. Accord-
ing to the rules set up by WAA
council, the cup will continue to

for names to be engraved. Then
the cup will return to its rightful
owner, Phi Delt, the first bowling
team to win the cup three years in
a row.

Last Thursday, Phi Delt broke the
three way tie which had existed be-
tween Gamma Kap, Phi Delt and

Osborne was high scorer for Gamma
Kap with a score of 162 while My-

Phi Delta was 596 in the first game
and 584 in the second while the los-
ers trailed with 527 and 569. Pat

Rivalry Softball
Taken By Sophs

Two points were gained by the
class of ’48 as their softball team
trounced the lowly frosh 53-27 on
Page Field last Friday afternoon.

Duly, the Soph‘s winning pitcher
was opposed by Soulich who was
replaced by Pulvcl' in the fourth
inning. Peg gave only 2 bases on
balls while the. two frosh pitchers
gave up 13. The Soph’s had their
53 runs to the 23 the Fl'osh had
guincd at the end of" Lhc fifth inn-
mg.

Numcrous Cl'l'Ol'S were commlthd
by bolh teams. but the ones made
by the frosh gave '48 a grcui. ad—
vantage. Sicphclls and Harris each
scored fivc runs apiece for ’49, but
Lhc hitting power of Eoynlon who
sclll'l‘d seven in cighl. times at but
and Shapiro who SCUI‘l‘d seven for
seven was loo much for thc i'rosh.

party was over, everyone had
left, there was nothing to do
but create a party. After break—

plans were quickly drawn up.
Margot was nominated chief

Then there was another problem
that had to be faced—the cup—
board was bare. What to do?
Well, anyways, they went to
town, bought some food, made
coffee in an old tin can, did up
the dishes in the creek, boarded

The old camp settled back on

the softball league went its merry
way this week. On Monday the
Sophs, outhit by the frosh 15-10.

Tuesday as the Juniors took an easy

In this game also came the first

note with regret that neither the

to play without outside help each

some 200 men in school . . .

Things sound fairly promising
in that they expect to play a few

The WAA Fencing Squad ended   A V;
 I. . VOL. xxx NO. 27 ‘

its season in defeat when they met
the La Salle Varsity Team on Sat-
urday morning. Although none of
the State foilsmen were able to de-
feat their tricky and more exper-
ienced La Salle opponents, the team
showed a great deal of progress since
their last match.

The La Salle team, with three
years of experience behind it, found
the State team no easy mark. In
the opening match, Peggy Eggert
’48, Captain of the State team, put
forth an excellent defense against
her skilled opponent. Loosing the
match by a 5-3 score, the State en—
try evenly matched the La Salle
contestant in a fine exhibit of fenc-
ing skill.

Second Match

. In the second match of the morn-
ing, Mickey Seaman ’49, lost by a
5-4 score in the closest contest of the
morning. Molly Whelley ’49, was un-
able to out-fence a fast, competent
opponent. A close match followed
in which June Petrie, ’48, was de-
feated 5—3. Ann Sulich and Marie
Fernadez, freshmen, State’s last two
fencers both lost to the La Salle
enteries in 5-3 contests.

Interest Shown

All those who participated in
fencing this year have shown a great
deal of interest in it. According to
Molly Whelley ’49, “It's been a lot
of fun. It’s too bad their isn’t more
general interest in it because it is
really worth the effort.” Captain
Peg Eggert suggests that the fel-
lows here at State take an interest
in fencing so that competitive fenc-
ing between MAA and WAA may be
fostered. while Ann Sulich backs
her up when she states, “Fencing
appealed to the boys as well as the
girls who took part in it." Marie
Fenmldes echoes these opinions in
saying. “Sure was lots of fun, es-
pecially with masculine opponents."

Sabbatical Leaves Lure Professors Davis To Direct Assgmbly  Feature
To South Sea Islands For Research Mystery Drama

According to Webster, a Sabbati-
cal leave is granted to a college pro-
fessor every seven years for the pur-
pose of “rest, travel or research.”
For at least two members of the
State College Faculty taking their
seventh year in ’46-’47, it should
read only “travel and research.”

Dr. Elizabeth Morris and Dr.
Louis Jones are not dreaming of
the “summer isles of Eden lying in
purple spheres of sea,” except as a
place to work—away from classes
and the thousand odd students who
pop inquisitive heads into their of-
fices every other minute of the day.

Dr. Jones, who received a Gug-
genheim Fellowship for his work in
Folklore, will leave Albany in July.
He said that he was looking for a
warm, quiet hideout, with the ac-
cent on the warm, in which to work
on his book about the supernatural
traditions of New York State. From
a relative who had been there dur-
ing the war, he heard of the Virgin
Islands which seem to possess both
qualifications to the nth degree. Dr.
Jones has secured a house on the
beach in Fredricksted, St. Croix.
There he will put together the ma-
terial gathered by State students in
his Folklore classes, covering a
study of witchcraft, devil tales, In-
dian banshees. the Jewish Shedim
and just plain ghosts. Before he
leaves in July, he hopes to complete
a children’s book, also based on
folklore, and he will continue to edit
the New York State Folklore Quar-
terly from his home in the islands.

If the steamship companies and
airlines co-operate, Dr. Morris

ferent races.” She will investigate

gether.

Both Dr. Jones and Dr. Morris

Study Of Plumbing Proves
Fruitful In Housing Survey

“Nothing today, thanks!” was
the greeting the sociology stu-
dents received much too often
when they attempted to invade
Albany homes in a housing sur-
vey. At other times they Were
frozen rigid by an icy “Certainly
not!" when they timidly asked
if they might view the plumbing.

But the world being a friend-
ly place, the students got an
insight into many Albany homes.
They heard all about Jimmy
overseas, and held Baby Tommy
while his mother ran next door
for a “moment.” The students
claim they met all the charac-
ters in Allen's Alley, and many
more who could qualify for a
home in that area.

Their official final reports
show they know all about the
plumbing and lack thereof in
Albany and rumor has it that
they have met many of Albany’s
most interesting citizens.

On Constitution

Bentley To Assume
Ollice Oi President

Student Association officers for
next year will be installed in assem-
bly today, and discussion of the new
Constitution will be continued up to
the section on preferential voting.

The procedure for the installation
of officers will be as follows: at the
beginning of the program the tem-
porary Judiciary Board and the
new Myskania will be seated on the
stage. Helen Shure, ’46, retiring
President of Student Association,
will make her farewell address. The
new secretary of Student Associa-
tion, Catherine Donnelly, the Vice-
President, Eloise Worth, ’48, and
the President, Ruth Bentley, ’47,
will take the oath of office. The
temporary Judicial Board and Mrs.
Shure will then leave the stage and
go to the back of the auditorium,
and Miss Bentley will proceed with
the program and announcements.

The discussion of the Constitution
will be limited to about fifteen min-
utes in order to leave time for this
ceremony, and will cover Articles

up to the By-Laws. These articles
include the provisions for Election
Comlnission, minor Student Associ-
ation offices, impeachment of offi—
cers, succession to office, the veto
power, amendments and student-
faculty arbitration. Next week Stu-
dent Association will complete dis-

Wayne, leader of the “State Stars,"
requested that the band be allowed

Commons is supposed to be open to
all students at any time, and be-
cause the band has already charged

poscd is l'ivc cents per person. and
