THE FACE IS FAMILIAR
Amid all the other excitement permeating the rit-

mosphere on Friday last was the added attraction

of seeing old friends return to watch the Moving—

Up Day procedure so familiar to them all. During

the week—end. we noticed I’at Latimer. ’44 (in rip-

sweep and WAC uniform), Flo Garfail, and Peg

Bostwick, ’45, Winnie Jones, (in Navy blue), Terry

Smythe, ’46 and Rodney Folder, ’48. Also Stan Abrams,

’46. Max Braun, ’45 tboth of whom will be back in

September), Dave Siavin, ’43, Hank Brauner, '42, Ber-

nie Periman, Gad Bodrier, and Arnie Eilerin, ’41,

(You’d never know there was a K B reunion. would

you?)

At the Moving Up Day formal. once more enjoying-
the rustic of taffeta upon the dance floor and the,
feel of a starched collar about one’s neck were ex-
Statcrs lierb Leneker. ’43. former NEWS columnist
and Mary Betty Stengei, ‘44, former Co—Editor-in-
Chief of the NEWS, Buck llippick. ’45 (who is already
enrolled in the Summer Sessionwcouldn't wait until
September), Mr. and Mrs. Bill llaiier tricc Shirley
Eastmanr ‘41 and ‘43 respectively, George Ponies. ‘17
and Jerry Dunn, ’49.

Comes next semester and some of these ex~G. L's rc-
turn to State. The situation looks very promising tfoi'

It was 1 A. M. May 16, 1942. The
lights of the Colonic Country Club
dimmed and the music of Freddie
Gray’s orchestra faded into the
night as lingering couples danced
the last Senior Ball dance for many
a year. That was four years ago!

On Friday, June 14, a local orch—
estra will take up the strains of the
music Freddie Gray dropped, and
the Seniors will resume the old pre-
war eustom of dancing a farewell
to State at the Senior Ball. There
won't be a queen; there won’t be
entertainment. Just a semi-formal
way to say goodbye to four memor-
able years.

The programs distributed at the
door will serve as fitting souvenirs
to be proudly displayed along with
the other mementos collected along
their four-year journey through
State.

It‘s a Senior affair and Seniors
will reign biit others may come to
help them make their last college
fling a success. There is a slight

catch as to the attendance of un-
dergraduates. The women may not
have a‘ root over their trends, for
the dorms won’t stay open to' ac-
commodate Baiigoers. Only ,torch
bearers, chorus and orchestra memi-
hers and of course the all-important
Seniors will rate a room at the
dorm.

Betty Hamilton heads the com-
mittees for this first post-war Ball.
The only qualifications for en-
trance are a date, $2.40, and a de-
slre for a' good time. The Seniors
will take care of the rest of the
evening and make sure that every-
one has the best kind of time. Alice
McGowan is searching frantically
for an orchestra and Betty O'Neil is
still delving into her imagination
for a decoration theme. Ruth Elgle,
Gette Dunn, Patricia Buckley. Marie
Liebi, Mickey Navy, Tini Sabatinl,
and Jean Whitney are standing by
to aid with the decorations. Leila
Sontz heads the program commit-
tee, and, while Rose Beidl sees to
it that the tickets are printed, Es-
ther Will will take care of the sell-
ing enci. Doris Ives with the asssit-
once of Betty Rose Diamond will
take care of publicity. Tickets go
on sale about June 1, so Seniors,
grab your partners!

It’s been a long. long time since
State witnessed a Senior Ball but
the return of peace and of course
men seems to transform such events
from dreams to realities.

Tire Seniors have waited four
years for this event. A night—full
of music and laughter, signifying——
peace and farewell.
