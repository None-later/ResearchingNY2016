Rapid Review . . .

As usual, the end of the semester has crept up
with the startling suddenness of the final date for
a forgotten term paper. Its time to tie up the loose
ends of 1945-46 and slip another year into its place
in the file. But it will be a long time‘ before State
forgets this year.

We returned to classes last September in the
surprised atmosphere of unexpected peace to re-
stime the established campus activities. NEWS
Headlines read “Seniors To Present First Big 8
Tonight,” “l'Irs. Roosevelt Will Speak In Page
Hall,” “Rival Classes Will Sing In Assembly Con-
test.” And then, in the final issue of last semester,
came the first hint of changes to come. In the
best manner of Shakespearean foreshadowing, the
headline read, “Poll Discloses Desire For Change
In Method of Choosing lVlyskania.”

The next paper heralded the second major change
at SCT, “State Men Take Over Arnold House" and
“Varsity (lagers Open Attack On . ’age Court
Against Sienna." For more than three years the
student body had been marking time under an-
usual war conditions, waiting for a “return to nor-
mal” . . .lﬁvei‘yone complained about the ratio
and used it as an excuse for temporary half—meas-
ures. Now the time had come when there didn’t
seem to be any excuses for inactivity or ]:irocrastina-
tion.

And surprisingly enough, Student Association did
get down to work. The Myskania issue came to the
fore again and a 20-year tradition was scanned in
the light of a Renaissance of student interest.
Changes were called for and changes were made.
The battle was brief and brisk, but when the (lust
settled a new Myskania rose from the ashes of tra-
dition to carry out the will of the student body.

It tOok a whole semester to set the stage, but
when college reopens in the Fall there should be no
more pointless bickering over principles and no
more substitution of rationalization for action.

A Vote Oi Thanks - . -

During the events of the past few months we
have been so concerned with issues and principles
that it has been very easy to lose sight of indi-
viduals. liut through all the controversy and argu~
ment, Student Association has bccn lucky enough
to have a capable group of officers looking after
its interests.

We owe a vote of thanks to Slackic for her
capable work with the gavel cvcry l’riday in
assembly and for her behind-thc—scciics cfforl dur<
ing the rest of the week. With the ablc support, of
the other officers and the members of Student
Council, State has enjoyed a banncr ycar of stil-
dent government.

Our best wishes and complctc support go to ilic
new officers and Studcnt ('oimcil for lililoll.

THE FACE IS FAMILIAR

Amid all the other excitement; permeating the at-
mosphere on Friday last; was the added attraction
of seeing old friends return to watch the Moving-
Up Day procedure so familiar to them all. During
the week-end, we noticed Pat Latimer. ’44 (in up-
sweep and WAC uniform), Flo Garfall, and Peg
Bostwiek, ’45, Winnie Jones, (in Navy blue), Terry
Smythe, ’46 and Rodney Folder, ’48. Also Stan Abrams,
’46. Max Braun, ’45 (both of whom will be back in
September). Dave Slaviii, ‘43, Hank Braiincr, ’42, Ber-
nie Perlman, Gad Bodner, and Arnie tiller-in. ‘41.
(You'd never know there was a K B reunion, would
you?)

At the Moving Up Day formal, once more enjoying
the rustle of taffeta upon the dance floor and the
feel of a starched collar about. one’s neck were cx-
Staters llei-b Lcneker, ’43, former NEWS columnist
and Mary Betty Stcngel, ’44, former Co—Editor—in-
Chief of the NEWS, Buck liippick, '45 (who is already
enrolled in the Summer Session—couldn't. wait until
September), Mr. and Mrs. Bill [taller inc-c Shirley
Eastman) ‘41 and '43 respectively, George Potllos, ‘47
and Jerry Dunn, ’49.

Balance of $15,649.30
in Student Union Fumd

Dr. Ralph A. Beaver, Professor of
Mathematics, and Treasurer of the
Student; Union Board, has submitted
a financial report of the Student
Union Fund.

For the first semester, money tak-
en into the cash account amounted
to $15,098.30. This included re-
ceipts from the student tax tickets
for both the years 1944-’45 and
1945-‘46, the sum voted from the
Student Association surplus, the
money paid on alumni pledges, pro-
ceeds from the Student Union Day
and the Junior-frosh party held to
raise funds. and bank interest.

Disbursements for membership in
the Association of College Unions,
miscellaneous supplies, and a lunch
to interest influential men in the
Student Union, amounted to $36.56
which brought the total to $15,061.74.
Except for a nominal sum of cash
on hand, these funds are in the
custody of the New York State Col-
lcec for Teachers Benevolent Asso-
elation.

Bonds which were purchased from
proceeds of the Big 10 for the year
1943-44. and the Big 8 from last
year. plus two individual contribu—
tions. have a maturity value of
$3.550.

Pledges from the Classes of ‘43,
‘44, and ‘45. and a contribution from
u former member of the Class of
'47, amounted to $7,190, of which at
that. time $120 had been paid, leav-
1115:, a balance of $7.070 yet a: be re-
ceived. During the second sem-
cslcr $355 was paid into the pledge
account. decreasing the credit bal-
ance to $6,715.

The cash account. for the second
semester was increased by $587.56,
raising the total to $15,649.30. The
money was gained from the pro-
ci-cds of the second Student. Union

were admitted to the Commons, the
treasury surplus of the Class 01' ’45,
amounting to $181.46. and $6.25 from
the Class of '45), collected by the
Class of ‘~iti on Activities Day. This

At First Peaceiime Senior Dance 

It was 1 A. M. May 16, 1942. The
lights of the Colonie Country Club
dimmed and the music of Freddie
Gray’s orchestra faded into the
night as lingering couples danced
the last; Senior Bail dance for many
a year. That was four years ago!

On Friday, June 14, a local orch-
estra will take up the strains of the
music Freddie Gray dropped, and
the Seniors will resume the old pre-
war custom of dancing a farewell
to State at the Senior Ball. There
won‘t; be a queen; there won’t; be
entertainment. Just; a semi-formal
way to say goodbye to four memor-
able years.

The programs distributed at; the
door will serve as fitting souvenirs
to be proudly displayed along with
the other mementos collected along
their four-year journey through
State.

It's a Senior affair and Seniors
will reign but others may come to
help them make their last college
fling a success. There is a slight;

catch as to the attendance of un-
dergraduates, The women may not
have a; roof over their heads, for
the dorms won’t stay open to” ac-
commodate Ballgoers. Only ,toreh
bearers, chorus and orchestra mam?
bers and of course the all-important
Seniors will rate a roOm at, the"
dorm.

Betty Hamilton heads the com-
mittees for this first post-war Ball.
The only qualifications for en-
trance are a date, $2.40, and a de-
s;re for a‘ good time. The Seniors
will take care of the rest of the
evening and make sure that every-
one has the best kind of time. Alice
McGowan is searching frantically
for an orchestra and Betty O’Neil is
still delving into her imagination
for a decoration theme. Ruth Elgie,
Gette Dunn, Patricia Buckley, Marie
Liebl, Mickey Navy, Tint Sabatinl,
and Jean Whitney are standing by
to aid with the decorations. Leila.
Sontz heads the program commit;-
Lee, and, while Rose Beidl sees to

ther Will will take care of the sell-
lng end. Doris Ives with the asssit-
ance of Betty Rose Diamond will
take care of publicity. Tickets go
on sale about June 1. so Seniors,

,grab your partners!

It’s been a long, long time since
State witnessed a Senior Ball but;
the retain of peace and of course
men seems to transform such events
from dreams to realities.

The Seniors have waited four
years for this event. A night—full
of music and laughter, signifying—
peace and farewell.
