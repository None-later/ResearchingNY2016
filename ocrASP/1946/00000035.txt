'ir‘o 'saynthat this has been an un-
usual. year. for the Sports Page
wwld. be'a masterpiece of under-
statement. It was certainly a year
without precedent in more" ways
than one.~ '

Of course Mary Liz was an. un-
usual editor. Her smiling face (con-
trary-to the unlikeness that topped
her column) was «much a part of
the PO. as the variety of scribblings
found onthe blackboard. She be-
comes part, of Tuesday and Wed-
nesday nights that we will-never
forget. '- If due to the complete ex-
haustion of the members of the
campus's fourth estate conversation
lagged and a blanket of silence set-
tled over all, it was Mary'Liz wh
stood: on the desk and shouted . . .
“It’s too quietin herel”

In her column we maintain she
mentioned the word “feet” more
times than any other contemporary
columnist with the possible excep-
tion‘of Dr. Sclioltz.

. Despite the revolution she started
when she added “cute” to the lie
of “Adjectives for Sports Writers”
she managed to escape without in-
jury and continue to see to it that
men’s athletics were properly ap-
preciated on the most important
page in the News.

Men! !

It was an unusual year all around.
There was sports news that was
News” With the return of men to
these hallowed halls of learning,
varsity basketball took the sport’s
spotlight. Letter men of the days
of yore returned to give us the thrill
of cheering for a team that was re-
aliy ours. Coach Hathaway shifted
from Milne to State and varsity
sports were really here.

People stopped thinking of In-
dian ladder as a site of fossils and
visioned picnics, excursions, etc.,
instead. Camp Johnston really had
some visitors and a birthday party
to boot. WAA and MAA sponsored
a Commons party on Friday nights
and another social aﬂair was add-
ed to the college calendar.

It was an unusual year in more
ways than one. We never knew
what would happen next. The end
of the year was a fitting climax as
Mary Liz bowed out to he succeeded
by the first co-sports editors in
News history.

Under New Management

With fourth page under new man-
agement, things are going to be dif-
ferent next year] For example, there
will always be cigarettes for the
whole NEWS Board in the top draw-
er of the Sport’s desk, the editors
will write all stories to be approved
by the fresh reporters, no copy will
be turned in before 1 o'clock on
Wednesday night—soundst like big
time. doesn’t it?

To get on with our chatter we
would like to hand a big bouquet to
the new WAA leaders. There isn’t any
question about the ability of either
Sweeney or Margot. and a smooth,
efficient year seems to be in the off-
ing for WAA next year.
Cooperation necessary

Next year as part of our policy we
would like to have even closer co-
operation between WAA, MAA, and
the Sport’s staff. Fourth page is in
reality a service of these two or-
ganizations A large share of the
student body belongs to one or the
other of these organizations. We
want your suggestions. your ideas,
and above all, your support. We are.
dependent upon you, and you can
count on us to give both WAA and
MAA the best publicity possible.

To do some more crystal gazing—-
we see on Phi Delta’s mantel the
beautiful bowling trophy, and on
next Moving Up Day. we see a brand
new trophy awarded to . . . oopsi
The name is blurred and we can't
make it out. Anyway what we’re
trying to say is that a team who
wins the bowling league three years
in a row certainly deserves to keep
the award.

We would like to close with a plea
for the little sports like badminton.
riding, hiking etc. Great things could
be done with these sports if only
there was more student interest in
them.

The success of next year's WAA
and MAA proarcm lies in your
hands. Here’s to a bigger and a bet-
ter yeari

Next  A
I Plan Winter Carnival,
Playdsy,’"50 Reception

Edna Sweeney, ’47, newly-elected
President of WAA, released the fol-
lowing statement about the plans
for next year.

First, and most important of all,

iss Sweeney wanted the most co-
operation obtainable between MAA
and WAA. “This could be fostered
by the ‘Noontlme in the Commons’
parties which I think will develop
into a working asset to the whole
college." She stressed the import-
ance of everyone taking part, be-
cause WAA is for the majority and
not the minority. There might
even be a possibility that both ath-
letic associations would sponsor a
frolsh reception and play-day, next
a .

Jack Frost permitting, and enough
snowtime athletes” to make a good
show, Sweeney wants to hold a
Winter Carnival. In other colleges
and universities throughout the
country this has proven to be one
of the headline events of the year.

More Referees

The most widely participated win-
ter sport is basketball, and Sweeney
hopes that many more will take
part. “The women will be able to
obtain referee and umpire licenses
which would help them here and
also then they go out in the teach-
ing profession.” With more students
learning the rules, the standards of
play will be raised in the college.

“Intercollegiate play-days were a
source of interest to the students.”
More of them were advocated by
Sweeney, as this helps us to meet
other schools, and get an idea of
what we can do in athletics in com-
parison to their sports program.

Miss Sweeney stated, "I think we
have a wonderful council for next
year. There are experts in al-
most every sport WAA offers,
and this will give us good
captains to keep all of the sports
going smoothly and efficiently.
They are all enthusiastic and inter-
ested and I know that they will help
to keep WAA on the high plane that
it has been in the past. It's a good
feeling to know that you’ve got a
tip-top organization behind you.
Mary Seymour and Gette Dunn
have done a good job this year and
we are going to follow in their
foot-steps.”

Rivalry‘lClimoxed
As Doifys Win

‘M.clst wild cheers and shouts of
joy, the Rivalry cup was handed to
the class at State that has proved

its worth—'48! Of the probable to-
tal of 52 points, the Sophomores
copped 37—16 of which were won
through rivalry sports. Seven of
the 13 that Were won by the fresh
wore also added through sports.

The sports points parade started
on Campus Day when the fresh
gained 3 points to the Sophs' one
in such fate-tempting races us the
three-legged and old-clothes race.

But with the rivalry hockey
game came the beginning of ’48’s
race for victory. Cnptained by Wil-
ma Diehl, the team raced on to
glory and the coveted two points.

Next followed basketball with his-
tory repeating itself as the Yellow
Daffodils swamped the Red Devils
30 to 11 in the first game and 38 to
28 in the second. Plenty of athletic
ability came forth from the fresh-
man ranks but the experienced skill
of the Sophomore combination was
an unsurmountuble factor.

The bowling tournament resulted
in a tie batman the two classes as
the Sophomore men added 3 points
to the rivalry score and ‘49’s women
also iullicd 3 points.

With skill itself personified in
such '48’ers as Fran Muilin uud
Adie Fischer it was inevitable that

A Council

WAA
_ Sportlite

As the final season of WAA activ-
ity nears an end, several fans are
still taking advantage of the spring
sports program. Among these sports
are tennis, hiking, archery, badmin-
ton, volleyball, riding, ping pong
and softball.

Two Sports Combined

Despite poor weather, there has
been a fair turnout in the various
athletics since Spring vacation. This
year, due to the short period of time
left and because of uncertain weath-
er conditions, badminton and volley-
ball will be combined and credit will
be given in these sports jointly.
According to Muriel Owens and
Jean Harris, freshmen, co-captains,
the season was slow on the take-off
but things look brighter now as the
weather has improved. About ten
girls are striving for credit. Per-
haps the renewed interest may lie
in the fact that a new volleyball is
new in use, which incidentally is
the only bail WAA owns. As yet no
badminton has been played because
of windy conditions.

Hikes Planned

Archery is at a similar stand still
since there have been no days as
yet suitable for use of archery
equipment. Hiking plans are being
formulated. Anyone interested in
a Saturday stroll should contact
Jean Heginger, ’48, Captain.

Tennis fans can be found busy in
Washington Park. For the most
part, the same players who earned
WAA credit last fall are again at
the courts this spring. Perhaps the
reason for so few new turnouts lies
in the shortness of the spring sea-
son. Captain Wanda Temasik, ’47,
has announced that a tournament
will be planned if enough interest
is shown.

Ping Pong Continues

Softball practices continue on
Monday. Wednesday and Friday
afternoons at the dorm field. Al-
though rivalry softbail is over,
players are urged to continue prac-
tices. The WAA ping pong tourna-
ment remained in its final stage
this Week as three teams still held
top place. The winner of the Fisch-
er-Weiss—Lengyel-Fisher game will
automatically enter the finals
against Sewa and S. Fischer.

Thus far, despite attempts of rid—
ing Captains V. Nielsen, ’47, and
Ruth Bessel, '48, to organize riding
events, no interest has been shown.
Riders who are interested are urg—
ed to sign up on the WAA bulletin
board. The group will meet at the
corner of Madison and Ontario
Streets.

 

 

the 2 points for ping pong should
end up in the possession of the
Sophomore class.

The two classes next met in the
swimming meet with Hawkins win-
ning the newspaper race for the
fresh—the rest of the races being
tukcu by the Sophomores. Krugh
and 'I‘ilden starred for ’48 us Ethnl,
Hawkins and Puiver spark-plugged
the freshman swimming squad.

The Moving-Up Day ruces ended
the rivalry sports evenls and the
Daffodils wound up their athletic
career by snoring 3 out of 4 points.
Tichy, ’48, proved worthy of her
name "Feet" aided by Fisher and
Lavender with Seaman and Peck—
ham running for the freshmen.

So ends another your of tradi-
tional good sportsmanship and
teamwork in rivalry athletics. Hats
off to both classes—long may your
banners wuvell

By FRANK WOODWOIITII

Here we go again for the last
haul of the year. This columnist
has been warned that there will be
no more “fooling aroun " with the
so-called side sports next year such
as the one referred to this year as
“sofa-wrestling." No sir, fair read-
ers. there has been a housecleaning
regarding subject matter of all
sports columns; these unreasonable

sports editors require the sports

columns to concern themselves
largely with sports. This rather
cramps ourstyle but we will try to
bear up under the strain.

Seriously though, we are planning
a new and better sports page for
the coming year and we will wel-
come any suggestions at any time.
We expect that with the new male
enrollment, sports activities will be
greatly increased, thereby giving us
more room for comment. MAA has
large plans for next year in the way
of Varsity basketball and the re-
birth of other varsity sports as Well
as the advent of new ones.

Sports Rehash

It is customary in the last issue
to present a summary of the year’s
athletic events so we will comply.
Last Fall we enjoyed a very meagre
touch football schedule. The sister
class games resulted in a split. The
fresh-Juniors took the first game
and the Soph-Seniors retaliated to
cop the second. Against Med School
we got started pretty slow and were
on the short end of a 19-13 score.
The second and last game was
played against a Siena army and
we were overpowered by sheer
weight of numbers.

The next item of interest was the
MAA ping pong singles tournament.
This caused quite a bit of specula-
tion with most people picking
Weiner or Zippen to win. It was a
surprise to most of the “experts”
when Paul Wagner, the dark horse,
waded through all opposition to
make and take the finals from Herb
Weiner.

Basketball

Nothing much happened until 2nd
semester when the varsity basket-
ball schedule got under way under
the tutelage of Coach Hathaway.
Both the students and faculty were
very much pleased at the results of
the season. We won two games
from Pharmacy College, one each
from ABC and Law School. We
dropped three games to Siena and
two to Hartwiek. It was a good
season, although short, and we are
anticipating a good season next
year.

Spring softball has evolved into
u fqu li-ugue composed along class
ihuw, Alillfllllg'll there are only four
mum, in the league there has been
quite u bit of spectator interest, at
least illlili supper time. At the
pn-svu: lime the. Juniors ure icud«
mg- the league with 4 straight wins.
Thu: brings us up to the present on
lhe ycur's program of men's athletics
so we bid you all "Casablanca" until
llf‘K" i‘f‘lil‘.
