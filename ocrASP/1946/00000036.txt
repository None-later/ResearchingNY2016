Fund For Siudenl Union
Hiis Total of $19,850

The fund for the proposed
Student Union for State College
has reached a total of $19,850.
This includes $16,300 in cash,
and bonds having a maturity
value of $3500.

Last year’s senior class pledged
a total of $2485. The class of
’46 voted to donate the balance
of the treasury to the fund.‘

Receipts from the Big-eight
last year were $1342.61. This
sum will be presented to the
Student Union Board, this fall.

During ’45-'46, $9070 was
raised for the fund. This is al-
most half of the total amount.

The Student Union Fund was
established three years ago with
a. $1300. gift from the Student
Association surplus. Plans are
being made for the new build-
ing which. it is hoped. may be
started within ten years. The
building, when completed. will
provide rooms for the commut-
ers, and a place for student ac-
tivities.

Albany Answers
To Open Homes

With approximately 400 male stu-
dents erirollcd in college this semes-
ter and with only two organized
group houses for men being cur-
rently run by the Alumni Associa—
tion. the question “Where can I
live" presented an important obsta-
clo in many of the returning vet-
erans and non-veteran freshmen.

This housing situation became so
driqicrate. especially late in August.
that many of the students who had
already been accepted for the fall
semester wore advised by Mlllon Ci.
Nelson. Dean of the College, to re-
muin at home until some suitable
arrmigement could be made for
them.

It was the pics of tho iulniinlstra~
tion to convert the Commons into
a barracks pending the completion
of the construction of veteran hous-
ing on St. Mary’s Park. Furniture
and equipment which was to be us-
ed for the St. Mary's project would
have been used in the Commons.
However. because of the trucking
strike and difficulty in obtaining the
equipment from the War Assets Ad~
n'iinistration, this plan was tempor~
arily abandoned. ‘

In lieu of converting the Commons

Bentley To [introduce
Myskania, Guardians

Dr. John M. Sayles, President of
the College, will speak to the. stu-,
dent body this morning during the
first assembly of the year. Ruth
Bentley, '47, President of Student
Association, will welcome the fresh-
man class and introduce the mem-

bers of Myskania, Student Council

The student guide office, which _

has been located this week in Room
111. Draper. will be opened Monday
in Dean Stokes’ office across the
hall. Freshmen who were unable to
attend the official guide tour last
Monday may ask at the office for
information concerning the build-
ings. Printed guides to Albany shop-
ping facilities, and class ribbons, are
also available. A guide will be there

at all times to answer any ques- .

tions.

Each freshman will be introduced
to the officers of the administration
and the faculty by his or her stu-
dent guide at the President's recep-
tion next Friday from 8:00 to 10:00
PM. in the logic Room at Pierce
Hall.

Stress Commuters

Miss Mieras said that this year’s
program is emphasizing the com-
muters and urges that student
guides make a particular effort to
see that freshmen who live outside
Albany or in private homes in the
city have an opportunity to meet
the upperclassmen and attend col-
lege functions. She also suggested
that guides acquaint their freshmen
with points of interest in Albany as
soon as possible.

Other duties of the guides include
aiding the freshmen in finding their
faculty advisers, taking them to
lunch, seeing that they have a
chance to meet upperciassmen and
other freshmen. and accompanying
them to the receptions given to in-
troduce them to State’s extra-
curricular activities.

Myslcania Announces Rally
For Freshmen On Monday

Myskana has announced that a
Fresh Rally Day will be held Mon-
day afternoon in Richardson Hall
immcdaiteiy after the orientation
program.

The purpose of this meeting is to
get the Frosh together and to start
practice on class songs and cheers.

College Plea
To Veterans

into sleeping quarters with all the
inconvenience that it would entail,
the administration made appeals to
the people of Albany and nearby
villages by newspaper and through
the facilities of WABY and WOKOI
local radio stations. to make all pos—
siblc effort. to take shutouts of the
college into their homes until the
St. Mary's housing project can be
completed.

This plan was successful to the
extent of providing places for llil
students. Said Dr. Nelson. “As u. re-
sult of the cooperation of tho citi-
zons of Albany, we now have in
sight sufficient accommodations for
keeping all veterans out of the rain.
Thirty married men, however, will
hero to leaves their wives 'home on
the farm’."

A number of veteran students have
been able to obtain rooms by ring-
ing doorbciis in the city. The Salva-
tion Army has allotted a section of
their dormitory large enough to take
care of another (it students. Still
others are fortunate enough to live
within commuting distance of the
college. All in all. practically every
veteran student is finalized of a place
to stay.

Add Equipment
To Science Labs

The summer months brought
many changes in the science depart-
ment. New labs, new equipment and
new personnel have been added.

Improvements in the biology (18-.
partment were completed before the
end of last spring session but the
chemistry and physics- department
are still in the prooess of being re-
modeled.

Chemistry Department

A small room has been constructed
next to the chemistry stockrodm on
the second floor of Huested to house
the analytical balances. The bal-
ances were previously kept in Room
258 but the change will enable more
students to work with this equip-
ment at the same, time.

Room 258 is being furnished for
a physical chemistry laboratory and
is expected to be ready for use by
next semester when laboratory ses-
sions in physical chemistry are re-
quired. According to Dr. Oscar E.
Lanford, head of the chemistry de-
partment, $5000 worth of furniture
and equipment has been ordered to
equip the laboratory.

A new distilling system had been
installed whereby distilled water will
be on tap in all the labs. Previously
the distilled water had to be carried
and stored in the laboratories in
bottles which proved to be some-
what inconvenient.

Physics Dept.

Dr. Charles L. Andrews, head of
the physics department, has an-
nounced that the General Electric
Company in Schenectady has re-
scntcd several thousand dollars
worth of equipment to the depart—-
meat as a gift. The equipment will
be put to inunediato use in alter-
nating current and radio commu-
nication courses. Dr. Andrews stated
that the gift was especially welcome
at this time because shortages and
priorities make this type c! equip-
ment difficult to obtain. ’
