rs Combat Cold

By Consolidating Bunks, Bedding

To the tune of an apparently
perpetual-motion pump outside the
lodge and an unquestionably per-
petual-motion group of songsters
within, women of the Class of ’50
were initiated into the companion-
ship of their fellow State students
last weekend.

Neither blankets and baggage held
up by the truck strike nor buses off
on the wrong road blighted their
stay for the campers. Square danc-
ing and lusty singing kept them
warm before bedtime, and after——
Well. sleeping in your clothes helped,
and bunking with your cabin mates
helped a little more. but even more
drastic measures were required to
combat the cold the second night.
So into the lodge came the bedding
and mattresses from the cabins, and
counselors and flash slept side-by-
each and foot-in-faoe on the floor.
while the fireplace was kept blazing
all night long.

After original song contests, in
which the fresh gave a promise of
the individual ability which came
out the next nl ht ill the froth tal-
ent show, the C ass of '50 was intro-
duced to Miss Agnes Futtcrer and
Shaw's Pygmaiicn simultaneously.
She gave only We scenes and ad-
vised reading the rest. Librarians!
Stand by for a run on Shaw‘s plays!
And 0.0. and his guitar summed up
Friday’s adventures quite appropri-

ately with “When You Come to the
End of a Perfect Day.” But the and
wasn't quite at hand for there was
yet to be a candlelight ceremony ill
which a fiery “S” for State was
formed beneath crystal stars.

Saturday brought Dean Stokes,
Dr. Green and Dean Nelson to wel-
come the fl'osh, and ill the after-
noon puiuma-lincd slacks and six
shirts gave way to shorts as the sun
came out to broil the groups of
fresh listening to counselors ox-
plnining State's various extracurri-
cular activities.

In the evening the fresh were
given a preview of their four years
at State through the college movie,
and the counselors, not to be out-
shone by tile fl'osll presentation of
stars. threw a pajama party as vehi-
cle for their talent.

A sunrise ceremony at the foot of
a cross of birch and evergreens set
a Sunday mood, and then, to save
Dr. Snylcs from addressing ll. mat-
tress-laden floor, self appointed
squads totcd bedding back to the
cabins. The boys ill the kitchen
cooked up a royal send-off of roast
turkey and ice cream, and Camp
Vanschoonhoven settled down for
its long winter's nap while five
special buses set out for State with
a cargo of drowsy campers and their
ions of luggage.
