By Frank Woodworth ——

This week we are concerning our-
selves with some old problems that
have reared their ugly heads as
well as the inevitable new ones that
have arisen. It has been suggested
in Student Council that freshman
veterans who wish to take active
part in rivalry wear some class
token for recognition. In spite of
the fact that the “GI Bill" stip-
ulates that veterans are not re-
quired to observe traditions, it seems
only fair and reasonable for a per-
son who takes active part in tradi-
tions, in this case rivalry. to observe
the rules. We feel that freshmen
veterans should at least wear their
class ribbons or blue name tags if
they wish to take part in rivalry
events.

The next item of business is con-
cerned with ping-pong. The table
and equipment that we have at
present is inadequate for the needs
of the student body. This table was
purchased by MAA several years
ago and has taken a terrific pound-
ing ever since. We feel that a new
table should be obtained in the very
near future, if not sooner. Until
such time, we would like to urge the
people who use the table to be fair
about the length of time they play.
There are many people to use the
table and it is not good sportsman-
ship to monopolize the table during
the school day. If everyone cooper-
ates in this matter, we are sure that
the situation will be somewhat
eased.

Football Prospects

After some indecision, intramural
council has arrived at a football
schedule of sorts. The main trouble
has been the organization of teams.
It has evolved into a catch-as-catch-
can organization which appears to
be the best possible solution. The
main obstacle lies in the fact that
many of the men who signed for
football do not know each other
and, therefore, have had difficulty
in organizing teams. It also appears
that the men of the freshman class
have been especially slack about
signing their names to the list. We
would like to take this opportunity
to remind the fresh that football
is worth three (3) rivalry points
which might make a great deal of
difference one way or another when
the day of reckoning comes around.
The whole school will be watching
the game. No one will overly criti-
cize a lasing team, but your repu-
tation and class prestige will suffer
if you make a poor showing. The
score isn’t as important as the spirit
shown. So, let’s get on the ball,
boys. and turn in your names to
Ken George. who is in charge of the
team. He needs more recruits.

Small Talk

We have been interviewing vari-
ous and sundry (sultry) people in
regard to their opinions of the new
seating arrangement in Brubacher
Lounge. The first person We en-
countered was none other than the
cVer smiling (now sad) Irishman,
Bob Sullivan. Mr. Sullivan is quot-
ed as saying, “uribfuiii”. Graham
Duncan was equally pleusod. He
said, “I hear that they are reserv-
ing (n'ange crates, complete with
names, over in the St. Mary‘s hous-
ing dchlopment.” After hearing
these testimonials we are convinced
that there will be a new housing
problem at State College.

Honestly, folks, we’ll print the
football schedule next Week.

Football Season Opens
On Page Field, Monday

Seven Teams Orgeinzc
ln Intramural League

This Monday will commemorate
the return of a regular intramural
touch football league to the State
College campus. Although several
informal games were played last
year there was no organized sche-

e.

For the past few days teams have
been practicing from 4 to 6:30 pm.
to get in shape for the coming sea-
son. Starting Monday at 4:30 pm.
two games will be played every
afternoon except Friday on Page
Hall Field. With seven teams com-
peting it will take approximately
three weeks to complete one round
with each team playing six games.
Teams Organized

With the season just starting not
much can be said about the rela-
tive merits of any team but most
of them have some players who were
outstanding in the old intramural
league. The Ramblers led by Red
Evans should have plenty of drive
with Feeney, Kullman and Hansen
in the line-up. The Van Derzee
Hall (formerly Arnold House) team
will be captained by A1 Stone. Train-
with lots of high school experience,
should be one of the mainstays of
the team. Stan Gipp and Art Olivet,
co-captains of the Finks, promise a
light fast team with a wide open
offense. Howie Lynch’s Grads with
Bull, Levin and Munson on the squad
have a potentially powerful nucleus
to begin with if they can regain
their former prowess after their long
layoff. Kenny George is organiz-
ing a freshmen team. They're dark
horses since none have played at
State before but with a large fresh-
men class from which to choose
there should be some experienced
men. Bolo Marsland’s Raiders with
Ashworth, Hippick and Kittridge
have an untried combination of
speed and height. Sayles Hall An-
nex. with George Poulos as captain
and Zanchelli and Jackson as po-
tential spark-plugs, completes the
seven team league.

Rules

There may be some changes, but
the main points of the old six-man
touch rules were as follows:

(1) Two hands on rear below belt
for a tackle.

(2) Four downs to make fifteen
yards for a first down.

(3) Other rules as in regular elev-
en-man football.

Men who aren‘t on any team and
who would like to play or who would
be interested in officiating should
contact Coach Hathaway, A1 Stone,
or Bolo Marsland.

Tichy Forms New Class

Paula Tichy, '48, has announced
that all interested persons may sign
up for driving classes Monday from
7 to 8:30 AM. at the stamp booth.

Miss Tichy reports that lessons
will be given in "Minnie" (also
known as that yellow ‘car’?). Since
space is limited, only one student
can be accomodated in the front
seat.

However, a large registration is
anticipated and Miss Tichy has
made arrangements to poke a hole
through the top of the vehicle so
those sitting on the roof may have
an unobstructed view of the dash-
board.

 

MAA Council
Holds Meeting,-

Slaies Season

Roll out the goal posts, dust off
the balls, and clear the field! Men’s
sports are back at State to stayl
State’s first full post-war men’s
sports program is slated to get in
full swing early next week.

At a meeting of the MAA in
Draper Hall Monday evening, a vig-
orous sports program was outlined.
Bill Marsland. ’47, MAA President,
welcomed the new members to
MAA and spoke briefly outlining
State's athletic program. He explain-
ed that the MAA constitution has
been rewritten and revised and sub-
mitted to Student Association for
approval. Following this, Merlin W.
Hathaway, faculty director of Ath-
letics, was introduced. Mr. Hath-

away declared himself optimistic of
a successful athletic program for
both varsity and intramural teams.

Touch Football

Leading the parade of fall sports,
a “touch” football league made its
bow this week. Nearly a. hundred
men have expressed enthusiastic in-
terest in the six-man “touch” lea-
gue. Teams, made up of squads of
nine men, are scheduled to play aft-
er class games on Draper field.

For tennis enthusiasts, singles,
doubles and mixed doubles tourna-
ments are soon to get under way.
Soccer, archery and golf leagues are
also being planned.

Varsity, intramural and freshman
basketball will ring in the late fall
activities soon after Thanksgiving
recess. For the first time in several
years a freshman basketball squad
will be organized to strengthen fut-
ure varsity teams. State's basket-
ball future scems to be a bright one.

Also Bowling

Accompanying the swish of the
basketball hoop, the staccato bang-
ing of ball hitting pins will resound
from neighborhood bowling alleys.
Bowling leagues are being planned
and a tournament will round out
bowling activities. Ping pong tour-
naments, swimming and volleyball
leagues are other highlights of an
energetic fall athletic program.

Baseball, Track

Spring will find the varsity base-
ball squad kickiug up the dirt of
Ridgeficld Park on the first fair day
in late February. ’I‘rack. a newcomer
to the field of State varsity sports,
is tentatively being planned it
enough interest can be aroused
among the men. Tumbling and box-
ing clubs and a softball league will
round out it truly banner your in
State's athletic history.

“Rain, rain go away,

Don’t come back ’til Thursday."

There you have the sport’s ed1-
tor's idea of heaven.

A "recurrent headache” for the
sports staff is the problem of filling
up the “holes” reserved for contests-
that have been washed-out. Albany
has the most unpredictable weath--
er. You are likely to have perfect
sailing weather on the day you
planned a winter carnival, a ski
season without snow, or winter
blizzards in the middle of May.

:i' ’0‘ ill

“Sent on Wednesdai,

Printed on Thursday,

Delivered on Friday . . . ”

Either our newspaper instincts or
the natural impulse for self-preser-
vation prompts us to try to cover
all sports events. But it is impos-
sible for us to cover any athletic
events scheduled on Thursday. The
copy is sent to the printers on Wed-
nesday and the paper is in the pres-
ses before any Thursday results
can be reported. We hope that the
presidents of WAA and MAA as
well as the rivalry managers will
keep this in mind when scheduling
events throughout the year.

“Sauce for the goose,

Is sauce for the gander . . .”

We mentioned that the WAA bul-
letin board was beautifully kept
last year. Mindy did a fine job and
this year Elie Binn is following in
her footsteps. She has already start-
ed decorating with enticing notices.
But MAA was not to be outdone.
Notices, invitations and sign-up
sheets overflow their allotted space
and get plenty of attention from
passers-by.

Never before did a pink slip—
u piece of paper, that is—mcan
so much in the lives of State

Tuesday morning a notice was
posted on the bulletin board.
“College classes will be dismiss-

tober 9, and will reassemble at
8:10 A. M., Monday. October 14."
It's almost unbelievable, but by
golly. for once it‘s true.

Amidst the jumble of packing
and looking up train schedules,
the Seniors watch with envious
eyes remembering the rest of
the bulletin, “Milne School re-
mains in session and Senior
teachers in Millie are to meet
their Milne School appointments
during lhis period."

Seniors, Juniors

Seek To Clarity
Fall Dance Plans

'47 Votes Approval
Oi Nov. Semi-Formal

Seniors and Juniors will meet on
Monday to make final decisions on
the i‘ortlwoming dances next month.
Frank Woodworth, president of the
Class of ‘47, has announced that
Seniors will meet in Room 206,
Dl'upcl', while Alice Williams, Jun-
ior president. will conduct a session
in Room ‘20, Richardson.

At :1 meeting last week it was de-
eidcd to hold a Senior semi-formal
on November 2. Frank Woodworth
stated that as yet no further plans
have been made.

Quorum Lacking

Lust week the Juniors voted to
interchange the Junior Prom and
the Big 8, causing the dance to fall
on November 23. However. it was
later discovered that a quorum was
not present and a second meeting
was held 'l‘ucsduy. Again the quo—
rum was not present. The quorum
sci. by Student Council in assembly
lust Friday makes it necessary for a
lolul of 58 Juniors to be present be-
fore any business can be carried on.

Junior l'rom
The possibility ol~ holding the Jun-
ior Prom during lhc weekend of the
WAA Winter Carnival has been con-
slclcl'cd. The ‘urnlvul is scheduled
for the weekend of February 8, 1947.
Holding the Junior Prom at this
limo would eliminate having three
dances in succession; namely: Sen-
ior scmi-i‘ornull. Junior Prom one
the annual Slatcsnum‘s Christmas
li‘oruml. it is for the purpose of
scllling lhcsc dcluils that the meet—
ings are scheduled for Monday.
Clues presidents urge the attendance
of nil numbers in uvoid further dc-
iuy in making definite plans.
Il()\\'c\'cl', lhcsc suggestions are not

taken on tlu'm.
