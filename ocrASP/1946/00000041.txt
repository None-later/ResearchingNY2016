freshman associates herself with an organized group
for four years after a brief and extremely inade-
quate acquaintance with those in the group.)

The pledging system at State is stagnant and
inefficient. Sorority members and independents
alike have expressed disapproval. of the practices
involved, but still the system staggers on With no

Elsewhere in this issue appears a
letter to the editor suggesting the
formation of sonic sort of veterans’
organization. This. to us, seems an
excellent idea. Vets have problems
which are pcculiar to thorn alone.
With an organization. headed by a
committee or council, i'licsc coulci be
brought to the attention of the ad-
ministration and action taken.

There are 278 vcts in school now.
The breakdown: 62 grads. 60 Seniors,
3'7 Juniors. 52 Sophs, and 67 Fresh-
men.

COURSE NO. III—~HEPZIBAH EATS HUMBLE PIE
Synopsis

Last year, into the annals of the NEWS wandered
a strange child who answered to the name of Hepzlbah
Peabody. Her hair was short; her legs were long;—and
she didn’t know what to do with her hands. We last
encountered Hepzlbah in a kindergarten class at Public
School No. Forty-Four (and a Fourth), pedagogucd by
Miss O’Saycanyousec, principaled by Miss Minnie Slot-
kin, and homogeneously grouped by her intelligence.
This week Hepzibah is making a return engagement——
She has now advanced to the exalted position of First
Grader, Section B (dull pupils). As our scene openS,
the little lady is sitting diligently at her desk, chew-
ing away at a mouthful of black marketed bubble

gum...

 

There was one very dominant feature about the
first grade that intrigued Hepzibah. Miss Laffingwell,
the new teacher, appointed pupils to be things called
monitors. The monitors sat up in the front of the
room when Miss Laffingwell had to leave on official
business. and they wrote down the names of every-
body who talked. It was great, thought Hepzibah.
to be a monitor. There was only one thing that both-
crcd her—she was never appointed. Hepsibah made up
her mind to find out just what were the require—
ments for one to be appointed to this worthy position,
and then, one day in class, Miss Laffingwell told.

“A monitor," said Miss Laffingwell, “must first of
all be a leader. He must be able to control his fellow
men, not by force, but by the consent, and even volun-
tary desire. of those aforementioned persons” “Thai
is why," said Mss Laffingwell, as she got up to leave
the room, 1 am appointing Walter Snuglip to monit
while I am gone." And she went.

Hcpzibah did not like Walter Snuglip. He was
mean and bossy. “Hal” jeered Hcpzibah us Waller
leaned back and filled up half of Miss Laffingwcll's
swivel chair, “Look at the leader of men!" At this.
Walter Snugllp, who was mean and bossy, whipped
a. revolver-like object out of his breast pocket and
aimed it at Hcpzibali. "You're gctlin' it right 130-
twccn the eyes!" he growled, and pulled the lriggcr.
Then he went outside to the water fountain to reload.

Just as Walter slid back into the swivel chair, Miss
Laffingwcll returned. “Very ﬁne monitoring. Walter,"
she smiled. “I didn‘t hear a sound outside.” Wallcr
prctcndcd to bc bashful and Hcpzibah wiped her face.

After this little incident, Hepzibali became even
more obsessed with the idea of becoming a montor.
I1 Wallcr Snuglip could be a monitor, so could she. If
only Miss Laffingwcll would leave the room on of—
ll('lill business and appoint Hcpzibah to sit at llcr
dcsk, slic would be the best darn monitor Public
School No. Forty-Four land a Fourtlii ever had.

For four months she wuitcd~nnd then the day
came. “I am going out to the playground for ll litllc
whilc," said Mss Laffingwcll. "Hcpzibali Peabody will
you please be the monitor?" Hcpzibah flew into llic
swivel chair. Then she looked up and said, “Yrs.”
 Lip'fiugwcll tlicii gave Hcpzibali a pencil and :1

1-0 i paper. "No tulki 1' i r 1" ' '
said And She 10“. ng whllc I am gout. sin

The minute Miss Luffingwoll left the room cvcrv—
body began to talk. “Quict, plcnsc," suid Hcpzibiill soft—
ly. "or I will put your iiilmcs on the list." But lllc
talking continued. It. got. loudcr and loudcr. l‘lt‘DZlbllll

Activities Day To Begin Baffle
Between Bluejays, Red Devils

The noise of bustling, bewildered
frosh will again ring through the
Commons, this year, as Activities
Day once more rolls around. The
affair originally scheduled for Co-
tober 12, has been postponed until
Saturday, October 19, because of the
unexpected vacation. Once again at.
1:00 o'clock, a barrage of bunnies
will descend the narrow stairway to
the Commons. This year the beanlcs
arc bluc, instead of red, but from
all indications, spirit will lean more
toward the brighter tones.

Activities Day will begin the life
of cxlrii—curricular activities for the
fresh, when they may sign up for
publications, departmental clubs.
Debate Council, religious clubs,
sports, Dramatics and Art's Coun-
cil, 1.G.C., and Music Council, to say
nothing of Myskania, or blind dates.

Now the mad world of extra-curri-
cular activities begins for the class
of '50. and they can sadly bid good-
bye to their free time.

Activities Day also ushers in the
beginning of the end for the green
and white. That’s the day the Sen-
iors hang their class banner in the
Commons. It may be dirty. or
slightly manliandlcd, but there it
will hang~—thc symbol of another
yi‘rir. another class.

At 7:30 P. M. the students will
meet on the dorm field between
tillylcs and Pierce. ’l‘licrc everyone
will asscmble with their class before
LllL‘ bonfirc, where the Songleadcrs
will lcild their respective classes in
singing. Maybe the fresh don't
know it. but rivalry will officially
blgin. For Activities Day they will
rcccii'c their banner; and that.
means lroublc. With tlic freshmen
behind their banner, unofficial riv-
alry singing also begins. All that's
nccdcd are good lungs and lols of
spll'll—wllfil, yolccs fit. for opera. In
lhls c.1sc 11's quantity as much as
