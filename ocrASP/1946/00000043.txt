Students To Teach

German Classes

For the first time in State history
the German Department is over-
crowded, according to Mr. Wil-
liam Meyer, Head of the Depart-.
ment. The German I class, con-
sisting of 78 students, will be divid-
ed into three sections, tw0 of which
are being taught by student assist-
ants, Mrs. Arlene Vetter Paetow. ’47,
and Luke Zilles, ’48; the German II
class, in which 52 students are en-
rolled, will be cut in half and Mr.
George Kunz, ’47, student assistant,
will teach one of these classes.

All three of the assistants are ma-
jors or minors in German and are
pursuing further the study of the
language while teaching it. Mrs.
Paetow will have a double major
and minor in German and mathe-
matics. When asked whether or not
she enjoyed the prospect of teach-
ing the German class. Mrs. Paetow
replied that she couldn't say just yet,
but she finds German both an in-
teresting and an enjoyable lan-
guage.

Zillcs

Zilles, a veteran of World War II.
was stationed in Germany during
the war. He commented that being
in the country gave him a more
practical knowledge of the language,
and also a chance to see what the
people and country are like. He has
studied German for six years, and
is working for an AB. degree with
a major in English and a minor in
German.

Kunz

Kunz, also a veteran of the re-
cent war, has a proficient knowledge
of the German language. Included
in his Army jobs was the position of
interpreter for the Office of Military
Government in Berlin during the
early months of occupation. He is
also working for an AB. degree with
a major in Social Studies and a
minor in German. Kunz says that
he is privileged to be able to teach
a college class while only a student
himself.

themes, one vigorous, the other
quieter. The usual procedure is a
vigorous, quick allegro followed by
an andante or adagio in contrast. It
is slow and lyric in character. The
third movement is strongly rhyth-
mic in character and provides relax-
ation for the listener. Most sonatas
follow a form similar to this.

The first sonata on the program
is Sonata opus 30, No. 2 for violin
and piano by Beethoven. It is a
militaristic sonata in four move-
ments. The first movement has a
march theme and a plaintive theme
developing which is followed by the
adagio and the sherzo movements.
This sherzo movement was one of
Beethoven's own inventions in the
sonata form to lighten the general
mood. In conclusion. the allegro
movement is the rhythmic rondo
with the sounds of drums and trum-
pets mingled in the victorious theme
in a final presto.

The second sonata on the pro-
gram is Sonata opus 21 ‘by Dohnanyi.
Dr. Stokes has expressed his belief
that this is one of the finest modern
works written for violin and piano.
The quiet first movement is follow-
ed by the second movement without
a break and after a calm trio, leads
to a powerful climax. A soft repeti-
tion of the first allegro theme ends
the sonata.

As a closing selection, Dr. Stokes
will play the Sonata No. 1 for viola
and piano by York Bowen. 0f the
very few selections composed for
viola, this is one of the best works
of its kind, according to Dr.
Stokes. The themes of the sonata
are accompanied by sentimentally
expressed harmonies. The first
movement gradually gains in force
and a graceful cantabile movement
leads to the finale containing pas-
sages of dramatic emphasis.

State Stars Seek Tenor Sax

ALBANY. N. Y

A trailer doesn’t have all the
advantages of dormitory life, but
there are other points to com-
pensate for the midnight “bull
sessions," and campus capers.
Victor Miller, a graduate stu-
dent at State. didn't know what
he was getting into when he took
the marriage vows, this summer.
It's hard enough to find a place
to live, minus a loving wife; but
with one—well, the fates seem
to be against .the unfortunate

person. Wives seem to be an ex-
cess commodity in this modern
world of veterans and college
students. That’s what poor Vic-
tor found ou-t. HoWever, with
hopeful heart. he proceeded to
shop for a home—a trailer, to
be exact. And one fine Septem-
ber morning, Mr. and Mrs. Miller
set out from Cortland in pursuit
of education. Now they are set-
tled comfortably eight miles out-
side of Albany.

ousing Dilemma Continues As Stale Vef Occupies Trailer

Thirty-five of our more fortu-
nate Vets—those without wives-—
have had the good luck to find
accommodations in a cigar fac-
tory. After Dean Nelson's appeal
to the people of Albany for
rooms, the Salvation Army offer-
ed the use of an empty building
for a dormitory—a former cigar
factory. Someone should write a
book. “Life at State, or How to
Live in a Cigar Factory."
