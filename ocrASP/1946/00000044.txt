Necessary Evil? . . .

Another wartime casualty has returned to State.
All fraternities were disbanded a few years ago
when college reserves were called to active service,
but KDR has made the first move toward general
reorganization by meeting officially and electing
officers.

The natural assumption is that Potter Club, SLS
and KB will begin similar action in the near future.
The issue at present is this: How will the return
of fraternities affect the school in general?

It is common knowledge that before the war both
fraternities and sororities constituted a large pres-
sure group in college activities, particularly in im-
portant elections. This practice almost disappeared
during the war years, when it was no longer
necessary to be backed by a so-called social organ-
ization in order to receive a school office.

It is to be hoped that such conditions will not be
resumed when fraternity reorganization is complet-
ed. Greek-letter groups can serve a useful purpose
here if they conﬁne their activities to a social level
—which is supposedly their only reason for exist-
ence. Although frets will not have houses this year,
they will eventually be able to acquire quarters
and augment inadequate college housing. It is only
when such groups go beyond their primary functions
and seek to exert pressure on the college as a whole
that they become undesirable.

Now that the swing toward reorganization is def-
initely underway, we can only ask that members
stay within the ethical bounds of their groups. Fra-
ternities have been known as a necessary evil in the
past. Will they become so again?

Mr
For the last two years the regis-
tration at this College was at a
point where no traffic difficulties
existed. At the present time we
have a maximum registration with
the result that the corridors are
filled with people. particularly the
lower corridor of Draper, at the
time classes are passing. In former
years it has not been of particular
concern that students enjoyed smok-
ing a cigarette while passing
through the lower hall of Draper be-
tween classes. Now, however, the
press of the crowd is so great that
the smoking of cigarettes has es-
tablished a dangerous situation.

I am appealing, therefore. to all
students-4veterans and others—to
refrain from smoking in the corri-
dors. This request has come to me
from Campus Commission, and I
believe that they are presenting a
very good point of view. They have
assumed that at the present time,

8W, V ’-. .

while we are establishing a new be-
bit of procedure. some people are
apt to forget, and, while engaged in
conversation, t a cigarette.
Members of Campus Commission
have, under this assumption, ap-
proached those who have lighted
cigarettes; but certain students have
refused to dispose of the cigarette
or go elsewhere.

In any type of democratic situa-
tion the welfare of the entire body
should be the concern of each in-
dividual, and it seems to me to be
socially intelligent for anyone to
refrain from smoking in the cor-
ridor and more particularly, if a
person forgets and does light a
cigarette to accept a, request to re-
move same with good grace.

The cooperation of the entire stu-
dent body is a. matter that will be
greatly appreciated by Campus Com-
mission and, I may add, by myself.

To the Editor:

During a. period when ethics for-
bid the mention of sororities between
freshmen and upperclassmen, we
wonder if the State College NEWS
has not become the “Voice of the
Independents?”

The editorial “Open Season on
Fresh" must have been precisely the
inﬂuence needed to convert the us-
ual rushing tension into an un-
bearable friction. And how many
freshmen must have been shocked
to read about the insincerity of “be
nice to frosh".

Rushing is certainly just as trying
for the upperclassmen as it is for
the freshmen who is being rushed,
for tension between classmates as
well as bitter disappointment at the
loss of a rushee is unpleasant, to
say the least.

We deﬁnitely agree with the edit-
orial that “this is a challenge to
Inter-sorority Council": a matter to
be discussed by sorority members
and revised, if necessary, for the bet-
terment of college life. But we also
firmly believe that sorority topics
should be brought to the floor dur-
ing the second semester, when the
sorority system is no longer a mys-
tery and can be discussed openly by
the entire college.

The fact remains, however, that
meanwhile upperclassmen will be
"rushing" fresh, not for the arti-
ficial motives of cute kid” or
“smooth” as stated by the editorial,
but because the rushee is the type
of woman with whom the sorority
member would like to live for her
remaining college years; the type
of person whom she knows will keep
faith with and work for her sorority.
The selection of new members is
the only means the sorority has of
protecting its future.

The Editorial’s last paragraph has
theoretically stated its purpose: “The
simple act of postponing pledging".
It is, however. impossible for us to
overlook the former parts of the edi-
torial, the words of which must have
bewildered many freshmen as it
described the “twenty-day friend-
ship" and “the old story with all its
original fallacies". We cannot re-
strain cur indignation at such at-
tacks and would like to have “fal-
lacy” explained.

Meanwhile, during this “silent
period", please, NEWS, let our news-
paper practice the ordinary decency
by not debating an issue which can-
not be openly discussed. until the
functioning of sororities is under-
stood by everyone.

A Sorority Member

To The Editor:

In response to a letter which ap-
peared in the October 4 issue of the
NEWS, I should like to avail my-
self of your pages to state my opin-
ion of veterans' organizations among
the student body.

Granted that the majority of
State’s present traditions, pranks,
and extra-class activities are juven-
ile to most of us, it is for us to aid
their maturation. not to out our-
selves off from the rest of the stu-
dent body. We might call the non-
Veteran students at State adoles-
cents if, and I believe I interpret Mr.

Sultan correctly, they are not ma-
ture; the business of the adolescent,
according to a sophomore text, is to
stop being one. At the same time,
the duty of the veteran is to stop
being one. It would be ridiculous
for parents to refuse to associate
with their children merely because

they are juvenile; it is equally ri-
diculous for men calling themselves

mature to withdraw from associa- ,

tion with others. It is an anti-so-
cial attitude, and easy proof that the
maturity which this group prides it-
self in having attained is a pseudo-
maturation. similar to the pseudo-
sophistication to be found in many
high school sets. The crux of the
whole problem of adjustment (a
mountain which has been made in-
to a mountain range by well-inten-
tioned people trying to isolate some
neurosis for every ex-soldier or sail-
or) lies herein; and the problem
calls for a solution rather than seg-

regation of those men who have

“interests in common which they
do not share with the remainder of
the student body.”

And I would appreciate some in-
formation on this type of interest:
Is it beer guzzling and reminis-
cences? I should think that [Ameri-
can Legion or Veterans of Foreign
Wars would supply this sort of in-
terest for those who desire it. It
seems rather incongruous that any
group of men who supposedly grew
very tired of seeing one another
constantly all through the years of
the war should now wish to pro-
mote an organization which would
insure that very state of affairs.
Furthermore, any such organization
runs every risk of becoming a sel-
flshly introspective group sessions
merely of safeguarding to them-
selves that part of glory of war
which they earned; it runs every
risk of becoming an association for
the promotion of the mutual bene-
fit of its members. Any lessons or
experience gained by servicemen
during the war belong to the coun-
try as a whole and should be shared
with the entire population as much
as possible, for the better interests
of the nation and the world.

In the final analysis, any veterans'
organization on the campus becomes
a discriminatory group, since by
definition membership is limited to
those men chosen by lot to wear
uniforms, provided they were physic-
ally fit. The campus of State Col-
lege is at present blessed with the
disappearance of college discrirnin-
atory groups misnamed “fraterni-
ties”. and I for one am opposed to
move to discriminate against fresh-
men who were too young to be
drafted. or those upperclnssmen who
were not physically fit, or those of
any class whose contribution to the
war effort was in some capacity
other than as members of the arm-
ed forces.

I agree with Mr. Sultan that no
veteran will rejoice in having a pa-
per tag tied around his neck to sub-
stitute for a metal one: but Mr. Sul-
tan apparently wishes to use the
discharge emblem as another tag,
and for me that one is as unwei-
come as any other.

COURSE Ill—THE LAST SUPPER

(Taking it for granted that the significance of the
Nuremberg trials is understood by all of us—)

According to the Associated Press, the last supper
of the condemned Nazis consisted of Cooked por-
ridge, bread, and coffee. On the other hand, the
United Press released the menu of the last supper as
sansag, potato salad, bread, and tea. The discrepan-
cies in the menu start us off on a. train of thought,
and before we know it we arrive at the following alter-
natives: (1) the Associated Press reporter thought
that the American people would resent hearing that
Nazi murderers lunched on sausage in these meatless
Weeks, and so thoughtfully changed the menu; (2)
the UP reporter was an amateur tea leaf-reader while
the AP man was a Brazilian, (and there’s an awful
lot of coffee in Brazil); (3) the UP reporter had been
raised on the theory that a child should have some
hot cereal each day of his life and as a result had be-
cpme conditioned against even seeing the word “por-
r dge.”

The fact that bread appears on the menus seems
to disprove the adage that bread is the “staff of life.”
It would be interesting to learn the various types of
bread that were served.

In an effort to remain an individual to the bitter
end, Hermann Goering alone had potassium cyanide.
No one, except perhaps Senator Taft, can deny that
the 11 Nazis received their just desserts.

0f Checks and Balances

The Common-Stator is given the widest latitude as
author of this column. His viewpoints do not neces-
sarily reﬂect those of the State College News.

A SAD NOTE

We bring sad news this week. Monday we Dragoned
to Watervliet and injuired about the possibility of
receiving substinence checks by Xmas, and the true
word was spoken in jest. Our contact man had no
idea that school had begun here, and several indi-
viduals inquired about were not even on record. So we
left. Tuesday brought a brief interview with Mr.
Townley, VA representative at State.

Much woe. His inside opinion was that checks would
not arrive in any near future—six weeks to three
mqnths before the postman would bring the good
no e.

 

Reasons: The some staff that last semester handled
3,000 cases in this district has now 15,000 cases to
contend with; the finance office moved and the
old “lost in transit” applies to many records, et ciru-
dera ad nauseam.

So, in collaboration with the Part-Time Employ-
ment Bureau, we shall publish available jobs as they
come up. Here's what’s to be had now:

Man for fountain service. Split hours. Food & pay.

2 men for outside work. No details.

Telephone operator, nites. Meal 8; money.

Man to clean apt. 2-3 hrs. weekly.

Ushers. All theatres.

For complete information on these jobs sec Mrs.
Malseed in the Dean of Women’s office.

OUT ON A LIMB

We recently checked into that seasonal football,
the St. Mary’s Housing Project—perish the thought.
From first-hand observation and what little un-
official information there was, we start sawing. Some
apartments should be available for familied vets by
1 December. The dormatory section. 2 a room, with
the grace of supplies and an unknown element, may
be open by 15 January. The matter of preference re-
mains one of those mysterious “we have no informa-
tion" secrets. ' ' ‘

With so many students eating out and not having
personal facilities at their disposal, Common-Stator
will run from time to time “finds” which we run
across. We are plugging no one. We have no affilia-
tions with any of the places mentioned. The informa-
tion is given for your acceptance or rejection.

Eating houses. The Pewter Pitcher at 115 Lark of-
fers well-balanced. tasty dinners at very reasonable
prices. Takes an hour to eat, but is well worth it for
those who must eat out most of the time.

For Chinese and American food, the Canton Res-
taurant at 23 South Pearl is good. Prices reasonable,
fast service. Never too crowded.

O U 0

Although a little late in the season, we like to
comment on th officiating at the intro-mural football
games. Adversely. We don't mean to criticize the
individuals, for as such they deserve praise for un-
dertaking the job. But the job done is and. If gym
classes concentrated on producing officials for games
instead of whatever their object is. the classes would
have a purpose other than a consuming time. and
our intro-mural leagues would be more inviting.

Rivalry Football Game Today
On Page Hall Field At 4:30

I Freshmen Team

 

Favored To Win

Today at 4:80 the Frosh Blue Jays
will meet the Soph Red Devils to
determine three of the coveted ri-
valry points given to the win-
ner of the rivalry football game.
The game will be played on Page

Hall ﬁeld and is the ﬁrst of men's ‘

rivalry games held this year.
From the present outlook, the
frosh appear to have some advant-
age over '49 in that part of the team

intramural league. Kennie George,
captain of the Blue Jays, is a fast,
shifty player formerly known for
his football career at Philip Schuy-
ler High School in Albany. Sup-
porting George, is a team that has
proven itself a strong and steady
combination. Left-handed Sy Fresh
has earned his reputation as ’50’s
best passer while Hoyt and speedy
Tom O’Brien will be on the receiv-
ing end of the pigskin. Caroselln. al—
though he is shorter than the aver—
age football player. makes up for
his lack of height by his speed on
the ﬁeld of play while McGrath—
fast and shifty, and Fried—heavy
lineman and excellent blocker make
up the remainder of the team having
previous playing experience. Ben
Jackson, now playing in the intra-
mural league for Sayles Gentle-
men, is a man to watch in the game
today and Tom Trainer with former
high school experience to back him
up also appears as a threat to the
Red Devils.
However.
their lack of experience in playing
together have been holding practices
to polish up their working combina-
tions. Bob Kittridge will lead the

Blue-Jays Defeat
Myskania Line
In Tug- of—War

Outweighing the members of Mys-
kania by twenty-nine pounds, the
Fresh out-tugged them to win the
tug-of-war last Tuesday on Hues-
ted Field.

The fresh used a system of pull
and rest, which appeared to the
many spectators a reenactment of
the Volga Boatman song. Morley,
in the front, gave the signals which
were passed along the line to Tom
Trainer who had about three feet
of rope to work with on the end.
Not only did the men of ’50 “lend
Weight" to the line, but the women
were no slackers either.

Myskania, on the other hand,-
(or we should say on the other end
of the line) had nimble Lashinsky
in the front, while Combs brought
up the rear. Telian, the feather-
weight of the team, was behind
Lashinsky, followed by . Sweeney,
Bentley, and 121 pound NEWS edi-
tor Tessier. Middleweight Cocky was
in the center of the line followed
Alverson, Mrs. AKR, Hutch, Conley,
Hilt, and “Champ” Margot.

The weighing-in ceremonies start-
ed at four-thirty with Phil officiat-
ing and members of all four classes
checking the weights.

The center of the rope was “ap-
proximated” (with Myskania get-
ting the short end) and the tug-
of-war was started. The freshmen
started pulling and Conley (in Mr.
AKR’s white monkey-suit) was lit-
erally and figuratively pulled and
dragged over the “established” fin-
ish line.

many drawbacksthis fall; thb't 
hope to see avoided during the com-
ing basketball season. The first
thing that is causing trouble to all:
teams in the fact that very for
teams are starting their games on?
time, _ with the result that. these
games have to be played after it gets
gqu dark to see either players or the
a .

Another glaring trouble has been
the matter of referees. We recom-
mend that MAA adopt a resolution
to reimburse referees with the stip-
ulation that those referees engaged
be well informed on all rules and
technicalities. We realize that it
is not all the fault of the fellows
who have done their best to call
games as fairly as they knew how.
In many instances referees were
pressed into service from the side-
lines which is seldom a good policy.
In several games it has been appar-
ent that the players have charge
rather than the referee and it was
a. case of the team who had the
best lungs winning the decisions.
Not only has this constant bicker-
ing held up the games, but it has
tended to make the games unneces-
sarily rough and dirty. We realize
that football is not a lace pantie
game but it has been obvious that
many of the games would have been
better played if they had been un-
der better control.

At the present time the league is
being led by the Ramblers who have
powerhoused their way over all op-
position to date for a record of 4
wins and no losses.

The Fresh are in 2nd place with
3 wins and 1 loss. Van Derzee Hall
has won 2 games, lost none and
tied one.‘ The Finks have won 2
and lost 3 games. Next in order are
the Sayles Hall Gentlemen who have
won 1 and lost 1. The grads have
yet to score a win but have one tie.
The Raiders are in last place with 4
defeats.

‘Ranking is determined on a point
system. Wins are awarded 2 points:
ties, 1 point; and losses, 0 points.
