 72.350 Rivalry Pushballl
"catered On Page Field Today

 

 

sophs Experience
May Turn Tide

The two rivalry classes will field
ten men each this afternoon when
the pushball game is held at 4:30
on Page Field.

The Sophs have the edge as there
are about eight men who played
here in previous years. Bob Mer-
ritt, ’49, one of these men, is cap-
tain of the Soph team. Ben Jack-
son is in charge of '50’s aggregation.

When the last rivalry pushball
game was held in the fall of 1942,
the fresh defeated the Sophs. These
men, Kinn, Monroe, Merritt, Bibi-
ano, Powell, Amyot, Wilcox and
Howarth, now members of the ’49
team, were members of the winning
group.

Frosh Spirit

Even though the Sophs have the
experience, the frosh have the spirit
and that “do or die" air that was
evidenced in the recent football
contest. According to the trash
captain, Jackson, “the team will be
fighting for those three points to
keep them in the lead.” At least
one-half of the freshman tea-m is
composed of veterans, namely Lang,
Trop, Borten, King, Fersh, and
Margolin, whose weight may be the
deciding factor for the Class of ’50.

Frank Woodworth and William
Marsland, Seniors, Chairman of riv-
alry and President of MAA respec-
tively, have released the following
rules for the pushball contest.

By Frank Woodworth

Avant la guerre there existed on
the State College campus an organ-
ization known as Epsilon Tau Ome-
ga. It was in the form of a service
fraternity composed of fellows who
had previously had Scouting ex-
perience. The main purpose of this
club was to promote hiking and
camping as regular extra-curricular
activities. The only possible objec-
tion to this organization was that
it was selective and limited in mem-
bership. Consequently. it has been
recommended that this club be in-
corporated into MAA as an outing
club. We heartily endorse this pro-
posul and we feel that many mom
men could profit by this plan than
was previously possible. Also there
is a possibility that MAA and WAA
could combine their camping efforts
—undcr proper supervision. that is.

Today some of the former Epsilon
’I‘ou Omega members are starting
the bull to roll by embarking on a
week-end camping venture in the
Berkshire Hills. This trip will start
late this afternoon and will and
Sunday night. The group will take
the train to Chathain and than will
hike six miles up into the hills to a
lodge which is owned by a man who
generously permits its use by State
College campers. We are assured
that the cooking, under the direc-
tion of Butch Walker, will be copes-
thctic. At any rate, this venture
is a step in the right direction and
We are sure that it will no followed
by many more tri is of this sort and
including more is lows than is pos-
sible at this time.

Women's Athletic Association
Council held its second meeting of
the year last Saturday, October 19.
Plans were drawn up for a hayride
and a new intramural WAA Coun-
oil.

The annual hayride is scheduled
for Friday. November 1. Bev Sittig,
’49. Chairman of the event, has an-
nounced that all who are interested
are to moot in school and then pro-
ceed to Western Ava. where the
"hay" (it's not definite what type
of vehicle the hay will be in) will
be waiting. After the ride there
will be entertainment and “cats”
in the gym.

Something New

In order to create more interest
and activity in all sports an intro-
murul council has been formed oom-
posod of all sport captains and
headed by members of Honor Coun-
all who are not President of WAA.
Betty Ann Margot. ’47, is chairman
of tho intramural council since she
and Edna Sweeney. ’47. are the only
two members of Honor Council and
Sweeney is automatically eliminated

Ramblers Defect Fin 9

Long runs, bulls-eye passes and
good blocking featured improved
play in intramural league games
this week. The Grads copped two
games and the Ramblers one. The
Sayles Gentlemen-VanDerzee game
was called with five minutes left to
be played.

With Bob Sullivan hitting his re-
ceivers with bullet passes, the
Grads ramped .to their first league
win Monday with a 19-0 win over
the Raiders. The Grads scored
early in the first period and never
lost the lead.

Darkness intervened in the other
Monday contest before the Sayles
Gentlemen-VanDerzee game could
be completed. VanDerzee led at
the time. The game will be com-
pleted Monday.

Ramblers Edge Finks

The long-awaited, much-discussed
Rambler-Fink match came off Tues-
day with the Ramblers on the long
end of an (18-13) score. Displaying
the classy passing attack and tight
defense which has kept them unde-
feated in six league games, the
Ramblers eked out a one-touchdown
win over a. stubborn Fink team that
refused to be brushed aside. Taking
the kick-off, the Ramblers scored
quickly on an end run by “Red”
Evans. Several plays later Hansen
snared an Evans pass in the Fink
end-zone for the second Rambler-
score. The Finks bounced right
back to tally on a Gipp-to-Olived
aerial. Second-half play was high-
lighted by “Tuck” Tucker's share
of a blocked pass and a thirty yard
run to pay-dirt. The Ramblers end-
ed the scoring when Evans scoreci
from the three. Brilliant punting

in Football Game
By 32-76 Tally

Tuesday afternoon the Blue Jays
of 1950 started the fight for rivalry
points by winning the rivalry foot-
ball game, 32-16. Although the
Sophs made a good showing, they
seerried llféglﬂe to cope with the
pass ng a ack of -
team. the freshman

At the beginning of th
quarter, the ball changed ehglilgg
several times deep in frosh terri-
tory, but the Sophs were unable to
push the ball across for a touch-
down. The frosh, however, were un-
able to move the ball out of the
danger zone with the result that
Ken George was downed behind the
goal line for a safety to give the
Sophs a 2-0 lead. This was to be
short-lived as the frosh passing at-
tack began to click with Fersh do-

O Brien took a short one for the first

Only the Beginning

The frosh kicked off, but the
Sophs were unable to get their at-
tack moving and the frosh regained
possession of the ball. Fersh hit
the bulls-eye again as he dropped a
long one in O'Brien’s arms over the
head of the Soph backfield. An-
other pass, this time to Jackson
added the extra point putting the
count at 14-2 and ending the scor-
mg m the first half

The Sophs began to move early in
the second half, but Jackson inter~
cepted to get the frosh temporarily
out of danger. The Sophs, not to
be denied, regained possession and
moved downi'ielcl with Zanchelli fin-
ally hitting the pay dirt on a. wide
end run. The try for the extra
point failed and the score stood at

further scoring.
Grads Score

With Hal Weber and Bob Sullivan
engaging in a pitching duel, the
Grads edged by the Sayles Gentle-
men in the other Tuesday game. The
Grads clicked for a tight victory,
winning (14-13). Walt Schick and
J. Zanchelli grabbed Weber’s heaves
to keep the Gentlemen in the run-
ning in the slam-bang contest. The
Grads scored once when Howie
Lynch snared a Sullivan heave, and
again when they shook loose their
halfback after driving to the Gen-
tlemen’s fifteen. The Grads con—
verted both their scores, and the
second extra point provided the
margin of victory.

To the Editor:

I would like to answer the letter
in which Mr. Collins has taken issue
with me over the question of a vet-
erans' organization at State Col-
lege. Since the publication of my
letter, an unsuccessful attempt has
been made to establish just such an
organization. This attempt suffer-
ed a, moral setback when a majority
of the veterans present at that
meeting refused to even consider
such a proposal. Many of them
were frightened off by the radical
outbursts of a few. It is not a trib-
ute to the spirit of Democracy at
State College that these men did
not remain to help steer this group
into the path of moderation where
its energies could have been well
directed.

A great part or the resentment
came from those who felt that such
an organization would serve to de-
stroy the wealth of tradition pre-
served at this school. Others, with
more selfish intent, were afraid that
a veterans’ organization would tend
to upset the political balance so
firmly established on the campus.
Both of these beliefs are extremely
fallacious. After due reconsidera-
tion, I would like to withdraw the
suggestion that such a group have
representation on the student coun-
cil.

Mr. Collins has attacked this
movement as being a separatist
movement. He has said, “that it
runs the risk of becoming an asso-
ciation for the promotion of the
mutual benefits of its members.” I
must confess, in all honesty, that
this statement is true not only of
this organization but every other
organization in school. I suggest
that Mr. Collins put down his Edu-
cation textbook long enough to read
Kornhauser and the seven motives
that he has advanced for the ex-
planation of man’s tendencies to-
ward organization. People do not
organize for negative purposes but
for the positive expression of mutual
interests.

Mr. Collins prematurely rejoices
in the absence of the fraternities at
State College. We can all agree, I
am certain, that fraternities are at
least as separatist as a veterans'
organization would be. and yet I
hear no voices raised in loud pro-
test at their return.

To Mr. Collins’ query as to the
interests of the veterans as a group,
I can only say that he has wilfully
distorted my thought pattern. The
interests of veterans are the inter-
ests of society as a whole. I do not
elect to use the discharge emblem
as a distinguishing badge. Society
has designated me a veteran and I
am only adjusting myself to an ex-
istent situation.

I would like to suggest an alter-
nate plan of organization. I recom-
mend the election of a council, with
no formal organization behind it,
to serve us a liaison between the
fellows and the administration and
also to serve as a medium of dis-
pensing information. This group
would never be empowered to place
the interests of the veterans above
that of the entire student body. A
second alternative would be the for-
mation of a completely partisan

Harvey Announces

New Residence Rule

Mary Harvey. '47, President of
Residence Council, has announced
new regulations concerning hours
for women.

Tile new rules are as follows:

I. Alumnae or visitors, visiting a
group house, will 111ch the latest
hour prevailing at that group house
at the time of their visit.

A. Students who are out late with
Alumnae will be reported to Judicial
Board immediately.

II. All students are allowed one
half“ hour after all civic and school
activities to return to their group
house. The official closing time will
be hosted on Donn Siokc's bulletin
board on the morning after the
event.

To clarify the second part of the
rule. it is up to the lilfllVIfIliliI stuw
(lent to get to her group house one

tions. The Administration will check
on the time of completion of the
affairs and the official time for be-
ing back at the group houses will be
posted on the bulletin board.

group such as the AVG. I person-
ally favor the latter.

And to the man who raised the
question, “what are the problems of
veterans?" I can only say in re-
sponse, “What are the problems of
Mankind?"

Martin Sultan, ’49.

To the Editor:

I cannot rejoice, as some men at
State do, over the reappearance of
fraternities. It would mean that I
would be forced to drop a concept
of collegiate democracy that was
formed over three thought-filled
years.

Such organized social groups.
which have proved far from an in-
nocuous influence in previous years,
seem to have little reason for exis-
tence in this era of the new Mys-
kanla, Inter-Group Council, and the
strong feeling against secret or-
ganizations that has surged back
and forth across the campus during
wartime.

I have known a State in which
the men were not la'bled by Greek
letters, or were labeled as not pos-
sessing fraternity connections.
have known a time when the States-
men, which, I believe, still admits
any man wishes to join, seemed to
satisfy the need for an all-male so-
cial group.

It may be that reorganized frat-
ernities will not reinstate, which ap-
pears to me, a barbaric routine for
pledges. It may be that with the
reappearance of fraternities, the
quiet bookworm, the shy newcomer,
the socially unadapted man will be
ferrited out and set on the path of
proper development. I don’t doubt
but that the men who really need a
more extensive social life have been
neglected by the fraternities in the
past. And could it be possible that
college politics this time will not be
a football kicked around by a few
tightly organized groups? Frankly,
I think that some men wish merely
to relive a period of their lives heed-
less of certain changes that the war
has brought to the campus.

If these changes were proving a
detriment to the college, they might
have some justification. But is it
wrong to unite the student body by
removing artificial, man-made la-
bels? Is it wrong to attempt to
give each person here an equal
chance for social as well as intellec-
tual development? Is it not wrong
to limit a student's acquaintances to
those he or she has made in the
freshman year?

If we are to be teachers, we will
undoubtedly deal with many differ-
ent types of people. If as under—
graduates wc see] ourselves into one
group. I feel we have done some-
thing that really defeuts a phase of
our training.

Naturally. I am open to arguments
from the other side.

Martin Displays
Water Colors
In Draper Hall

Water color sketches by Grace
Martin, instructor of art, are on dis-
play in Room 207, Draper Hall. The
exhibit, sponsored by the art de-
partment, will be held through No-
vember 1.

The number of pictures exhibited
totals 22, including a few detailed
pencil sketches. Miss Martin left
Chicago and went to Spokane,
Washington with one of her friends
in August of the summer of 1946. It
was during that time that the pic-
tures were painted, averaging about
two a day.

Miss Martin has studied at the
University of Chicago, the Univer-
sity of Pennsylvania. the University
of Vienna and the Art Institute in
Chicago. At the present time, she is
a member of the Albany Artists
Group.

The Washington Park Bridge is
sketched twice: once at noon and
again at sunset. Miss Martin re-
marks that the nice part about
painting in the park is that there's
always someone who comes along
and says. “Cheezl Artists!“ The
homes, churches, and bridges beside
the Hudson river and the children’s
pool on the Swan Street Hill are
pictured exactly in two other sketch—
es of Albany. In addition to these,
there are paintings of the Coulee
Dam. Mt. Grinnell, a back yard in
Cheney, Washington, wheat fields,
Chapman Lake, Washington, and
even the two bridges near Lucerne,
New York.

The pictures of the west are in
purple, gold and black while those
of the east are predominantly green.
Miss Martin explained that she en-
joyed the contrast of colors.

Freshman Fellows Fm Fifty
From Fierce Foo By Force

Cheering and yelling galore
could be heard last Wednesday
night in Draper. It’s dangerous
to interrupt frosh skit practice.

While the freshmen were in
Room 206, Draper Hall, a few
Soph girls were "minding their
own business" just outside the
door. With discovery came the
not! The fresh men fostered
the idea that if the Sophs-
couldn’t go peacefully, there was
no law against removing them
by brute force. Agnes McIntyre,
’49, added fuel to the fire by
asking why they didn’t try it.
Dolores Kloster, ’49. came down
the stairs feet first, her mouth
stuffed with her own bandana.
Frances Flanagan, ’49, was more
outraged over the loss of her
shoe and sock than the rough
treatment.

Just as a News reporter be-
gan to question Beverly Sittig,
'49, a mob of men dashed back,
threw her over their shoulders
and out the door she went!

Budget Increase
$1000 Will Lesson
Deficits”: Coveneugll

In Assembly last week Jean Ca-
vanaugh, ’47, business manager of
the Pedagogue, introduced a motion
asking that $800 be given to Peda-
gogue from the Surplus Fund. Ac-
cording to Miss Cavanaugh the in-
creased cost of producing the Ped-
agogue made ther usual allotment
of $2500 insufficient.

After introducing the motion.
Miss Cavanaugh explained that the
increase is necessary because of
the rising cost of labor and meter-
ials, additional copies, incl-eased
size due to greater number of Sen-
rare.

In the discussion following, Miss
Cavanaugh said, “If this money is
not taken from the surplus, you will
