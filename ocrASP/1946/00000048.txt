of the freshman class to unite it
into a smoothly working machine
that will operate efficiently and ra-
pidly to obtain the rivalry cup.
Romulus’ Platform

Now is the time for all good fresh-
men to come to the aid of their
class. In order to make the Class of
’50 outstanding, you freshmen must
select your leaders wisely. Choose
those whom you think will repre—
sent you as you should be repre-
sented. And after you have selected
your leaders, give them your ut-
most co-operation. Let your good
judgment guide you and may the
best man win.
Teitelbaum's Platform

Whatever the freshman class de-
cides upon, I will back to the fullest
extent and devote all my energies to
fulfill that desire. I am particularly
interested in establishing credit for
phys. ed. for veterans due to service
experience.

Big 8 Proceeds

The Big-Eight series, originally
consisting of ten major affairs, was
instituted as a wartime measure to
replace the formals and social activ-
ities that disappeared from the
campus with the war. The proceeds
were used to buy war bends and aid
in the Rhodes Hospital project. Last
year, however, the students voted to
contribute the money obtained from
these presentations to the Student
Union fund. The [four classes, and
the major organizations of the col-
lege sponsor the Big-Eight series.
T e next one for the year will be
the Commuter’s Club presentation,
November 16. This year Jane
O'Brien, '48, is Chairman of the Big-
Eight committee. ,

Everyone has been invited to at-
tend the Senior dance. Miss Zumbo
has stated that anyone may bring
his friends. Tickets will be sixty
cents, including tax.

Plans Frosh Sing
For. Assembly

The traditional freshman sing
will take place in assembly today.
Following the sing, freshman elec-
tion results will be given and several
announcements will. be made.

The program will open with the
singing of the “Alma Mater," the
State College Fight song, and “Arm
and Arm” by the freshmen standing
in the balcony. At the conclusion.
the class will march downstairs and
through the auditorium as they sing
“Life Is Very Different."

Election Results

The results of the freshman elec-
tions which took place last week in
assembly will be made. The newly
appointed members of Student Coun-
cil will receive their keys.

At a Student Council meeting
Wednesday night, Adrienne Iorio,
’48, was named chairman of the
Bridge Tournament.

New Fight Song

The suggestion was made by a
member of MAA Council that, as
part of rivalry the freshmen and
Sophomore classes write a new fight
song with original words and music.
There will be two points given to the
class who is successful in composing
the «best song. A board consisting of
Dr. Charles Stokes, Professor of
Music, and MAA representatives will
act as judges. The addition of these
points makes a possible rivalry
score of 65% points.

Sayles Extends

_ Library Hours

Until December

Miss Mary E. Cobb. College Libra-
ian, has announced that the library

will continue on its present evening

schedule for another month. Presi-

‘ dent Sayles and the Library Com-

mittee have been able to reach no
definite decision for the future un-
der the circumstances.

Inadequate lighting is the main

difficulty. The moment an ample 1

supply of lights is turned on, the
fuses are blown, due to an over-
load on the circuit. President Sayles
is taking steps to have temporary
repairs made until such such a
time as the general remodeling of
the library building can be done.
The possibility of the use of table
lamps to bridge the gap is being in-
vestigated. However, Miss Cobb
feels that since fluorescent bulbs
must be ordered and extra. wiring
done, this project will also take
some time.
Help-Necessary

Student help must be utilized if
the library is to stay open evenings.
There are some college libraries
which stay open with a complete
staff of students. In this case, Miss
Cobb says there must be some one
to help the students with reference
work and to maintain discipline. For
both the repair of the lighting sys-
tem and the hiring of student help,
additional funds must be obtained.

Zumbo Names 1946
Campus Chest Slogan

“Don't Pass the Buck, Give One"
has been chosen as the slogan for
the Campus Chest Drive according
to Concepta Zumbo, ’47, Chairman
of the slogan contest. No suitable
were submitted to the contest, and
the one chosen is a combination of
all the suggestions.

Since no one won the contest, the
prize, which was to be the picking
of 10 records for the Commons, will
not be awarded. Campus Commis-
sion will choose the records instead.

Queen Sally Dons Royal Robe To Reign On Campus Night

An air of expectancy hovered
over the anxious audience as the
revelation hour drew nigh—the hour
when the doors would open, the
curtain would part, and the pages
would herald the arrival of the 25th
Campus Queen.

As the shouts of “It’s Sally” rose
from the audience, the Queen, wear-
ing the traditional white gown and
carrying a bouquet of American
beauty roses, walked down the aisle
followed by her court of eight at-
tendants and 9-year old page to the
solemn strains of "Pomp and Cir-
cumstance.”

Amidst the loud applause of the
audience, Queen Sally walked to the
stage where she was crowned by
her predecessor, Helen Slack Shure.
Mounting the throne of purple vel-
vet the Queen, radiant and lovely,
reigned throughout the Campus Day
skits on her majestic pedestal.

Once again the crowning was over.
the Campus Day skits were given.
and the audience looked forward to
neigt Campus Dag when sally would
traditionally place the, crown on an-

other queen’s head.
