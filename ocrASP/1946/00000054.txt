By Frank Woodworth —-
The subject of our little discourse
this week can be called “enthu-
siasm.” MAA is planning a big in-
tramural basketball schedule this
year and we have the potentialities
for a good league. Some fellows
have already been down in the gym
Working out between classes. How-
ever, the enthusiasm of the hand-
ful of men is not enough — the
troops have got to participate to
make the league successful.

Intramurals provide a good op-
:ortunity for those of you who
would like to play but are un-
experience'i. The more men we
have out. the better league we will
have. We hope to have at least
10 teams in the program which
means that at least '70 men will
have to show up around the bulletin
board when the team rosters are up.
Again we urge you to show up for
games if you have signed the list.
Games will be played on week
nights, starting at 7:00 immediately
following varsity practice, and will
continue until the games are com-
pleted. It is absolutely necessary
that you be on time for games
because more than one game Will
have to be played in one night.
Pep Rally

John Dooley, MAA publicity man,
just dashed into the NEWS office
with a hot release to the effect
that MAA will hold a college pep
rally in the near future. Dooley
stated further that more informa-
tion would be given in assembly
today as to time and place. Let’s
see all you cos and coeds there.

The varsity has a tough schedule
ahead and they need your support.
Not only do you let your team down
when you fail to cheer or show up
for games, but you also cast a re-
flection on the student body as a
whole in the eyes of visiting teams
and rooters. Remember. we are not
a bunch of drab, outdated school
teachers —— at least not yeti Re-
member this — the team works
hard to provide entertainment for
you and to increase State’s pres-
tige; it is no picnic to run your
legs off for an hour and a half on
5 nights in the Week, especially for
an unapreciative student body. Also
remember that a good portion of
your student tax money goes to
NAA and it is your loss if you don’t
realize some return on your invest-
ment. With all those conclusive
arguments you can’t very Well af-
ford to miss any of the games.

Football Dirge

In passing, we will say a few
obituary remarks about the final
curtain for football this past sea-
son. First in importance in nation-
al sports circles was the Siena-
State 6-man classic which was
played last Saturday. It seems that
the “Gentlemen”??? spent the
evening before in true cavalier
f shion here and there and every-
where and were consequently cruis-
ing in heavy weather along about
game time on Saturday morning.
The usual accurate passing of Hal
Web-er was missing. (His dark
glasss were broken on the first
pay.) The passing attack bogged
down at the other end when Walt
Schick was hurt. At any rate, the
final score was 34-0. Guess who
won in three tries — the first two
don't count. I might say in closing
that you guys can blame Bcnlnati
for this; he gave me the dope.
When I need 108 lines for a story,
I'll give anybody the business.

Second in national importance
was the muchly vaunted Notrc-
Dame-Army game which bogged
down into a 0-0 tie. Many sports
experts expected and predicted a
tie —— but not a scoreless game.
Both teams had been scored on
many times and experts predicted
the game to run into the high scor-
ing brackets. As it turned out. the
sparkling defensive play of both
teams was the outstanding feature
of the game. Both teams' offense
proved to be ineffectual and
clumsy at times.

Last Minute Flash

"Geiitlemen" of Sayics flail An-
nex will replay Siena tomorrow and
promise that they will atone for
last week’s defeat.

MAA Revises
Basket League

At a meeting this week of the
MAA Intra—mural Council the pro-
cedure for organizing the intra-
mural basketball league was out-
lined. The Council is setting up
the league so that a maximum
number of statesmen may partici-
ate.

p It was decided that each squad
will consist of eight men. In this
way each team will be assured of
adequate replacements in case some
are unable to play every game. The
first game will be played December
9. Sheets will be posted today on
the MAA bulletin board and any-
one may sign up. All are urged to
sign up early so that the league
may be organized immediately.
Two League Set-Up

There will be two separate leagues.
In arranging a two league schedule
the Council hopes to include those
teams already organized and sub-
mitted and new teams to be formed.
Fraternity teams will make up one
league consisting of four teams.
The other league will be made up
of six departmental teams. The
English, Commerce, Language, So-
cial Studies and Science depart-
ments will be represented. Cap-
tains of these teams will be ap-
pointed by the Intra-mural Coun-
cil and teams will be made up from
the roster of submitted names.
Play-Off Plans

An interesting play-off card is on
tap after the completion of two
rounds of play. Teams finishing in
first, second. third, and fourth
place in the Fraternity league Will
vie with the leaders in the De-
partmental league for the intra-
mural title. In this way teams in
one league will get a chance to
play teams in the other. All in all,
the plan is a sound one and if
everyone cooperates this should be
a banner basketball year.

To Hold Classes
ln Lilo Savings

So many members of WAA have
signed up for swimming and life-
saving, that two classes will be held.
Marian Kragh, and Patricia Til-
den. juniors will supervise the
groups.

The first group will meet every
Tuesday evening from seven until
eight thirty. while the second group
will convene on Thursday evenings
from seven to nine thirty. Both will
meet at the Jewish Community
Center on Washington Avenue.

Preliminary requirements are the
ability to swim ten lengths of the
pool, do a surface dive. front dive,
and swim underwater.

The purpose of the course is to
prepare registered Red Cross Life—
Savers. who may obtain summer po-
sitions as life—guards or instructors.
“Even though you don’t want that

type of work, the course will give

you good training, so that if a sit-
uation ever arose you would be ca-
pable of handling l't'. Miss Krugh

stated. while outlining the aims of

the groups.

Make Single Score
During First Quarter

Despite the bad weather, namely
the storm clouds gathering over-
head, a. large crowd turned out to
see the rivalry hockey game playoff.
The fresh 11, who made such a good
showing during the first game that
the odds changed from Soph to
Fresh favorites, did not disappoint
the fans. The fresh downed the
Sophs to the tune of 1-0.

'50 once more rallied to the field
the team they used in the first
game, but the Soph lineup showed
considerable change. The Sophs us-
ually bank on their year of experi-
ence as a united team to give them
the edge over the less experienced
Fresh; therefore it was somewhat
of a surprise to see '49 change its
lineup.

Fresh Score

In the first half of the game the
Fresh got on the ball immediately
and demonstrated no weak ability
to stay right there. The crowd went
wild as the Frosh streaked down the
field and landed the ball on the
right side of the goal making the
score 1-0 in their favor. The pass
from Keleher to Adams had done
the trick! The Soph fullbacks seemed
to lack hitting strength in opposi-
tion to the long well placed drives
of the Frosh.

The Fresh were forced to relin-
guish the ball in the second half as
the Sophs came back into the game
with renewed determination.

This forced the now confident
team of ’50 to change quickly from
an offensive to a defensive game.
They battled up and down the field
with some outstanding passes made
by Sittig and Moberg, Owens and
Joslin. Sophs; and once again the
Keleher-Adams duo clicked. Hotai-
ing made several long drives for '50
which almost threatened to make
more scoring for the Fresh possible.
In the latter part of the last half
the Red Devils had the ball in their
territory most of the time but failed
to score due to the wardng off plays
of Mary Lou Henkel, left half, and
Ruth Smith, right fullback.

Crowd Enthusiastic

Neither team played as well as
they had previously demonstrated,
and it was somewhat of a disap-
pointment to the enthusiastic crowd.
However certain plays which proved
to be of almost professional prow-
ness more than made up for the
generally mediocre playing. The
line-ups for both teams as used in
Thursdays game are as follow:

Sophomores

Pless. right inner
Joslin. left inner
Owens, center forward.
Pulver, right wing
Avalear, left wing
Moberg, center halfback
Sittig. right half back

Sheath yourself in a shirt,
Jump into your jeans, don’t
wash out those socks from Sat-
urday night put them on again
and this time make sure those
tootsies are cavered and with
big strong sturdy boots. What
for? HaVen’t you heard or
don’t all of you sport enthu-
siasts read our WAA bulletin
board? T.S. (terrible shame) if
you didn't notice that sign-up
sheet for the Greylock Moun-
tain outing.

The Rensselaer Outing Club
of RPI (knew that would open
two more eyes) is sponsoring a
big “legstretchlng shindig" this
Sunday. Not only RPI will be
there but Mt. Holyoke and
Russell Sage too — more girls,
more men. more competition
and more hiking!

8:30 is the time, 3500 feet is
the destination. the top of
Greyloek that is. From logical
astronomical deductions there’s
bound to be snow and from
further deductions there’s bound
to be fun.

 

 

 

WAA Reports

Varied Program
In Winter Season

Women’s Athletic Council 'held
its third meeting of the season last
Wednesday night at Sayles Hall.
The first item of business was the
inauguration of the new freshmen
members on Council -— Ruth Mat-
teson, WAA Manager of ’50 and
Eleanor Adams, WAA Representa-
tive of ’50.

Edna Sweeney. President of WAA,
introduced to the Council members
a pending plan through which ath-
l-etic equipment could be sold to
State students at a discount. This
project would be conducted through
the combined efforts of WAA and
MA/.. Councils. Betty Ann Margot
’47 and Margaret Seaman, ’49 were
appointed to represent WAA at the
meeting of Men’s Athletic Council
where further plans will be dis-
cussed.

In order to facilitate future WAA
events, it was decided that the
chairman of each event is to hand
in a detailed report to Beverly Sit-
tig, '49, secretary of WAA.

The WAA constitution was dis-
cussed and revised — the revised
edition will be posted on the WAA
bulletin board for two weeks. At
the end of this time. voting will be
held in lower hall of Draper for
its approval.

Miss Sweeney read a letter from
the Athletic Federation of College
Women. an organization to which
WAA has been a member for many
years. The decision was made to
renew membership which had
lapsed last year.

As the official winter sports sea-
son will open December 2. the win-
ter captains Were elected by the
Council. These new captains will
meet with Edna Sweeney. Betty
Ann Margot, and Miss Johnson next
Wednesday noon in order to get
plans started. They are as follows:
Basketball: Mary Quinn, '48. Wil-

ma Dichl, '48. Dot
Midgiey. '40.
Ann Ethai, ‘49.
Marian Kruig, ’48.

Since the column “Back Talk"
was last week devoted to comment
upon Women’s Athletic Assoc., in
order to clarify the situation for
the benefit of all interested mem-
bers of the student body, we should
like to make public the following
facts:

1. Our official winter
opens this year on Dec.
closes April 3.

2. The use of the gym for bas-
ketball, as planned under the win-
ter schedules of both Milne and
State is not possible until the
opening of the winter season.

3. As has been our policy, cap-
tains for winter sports are appoint-
ed at the council meeting preceding
Thanksgiving vacation, which gives
all captains ample time to organize
their respective sports.

4. The responsibility for organ-
izing and supporting any team lies
with the group which it represents.

5. Participation in intra-mural
sports is entirely voluntary.

We can see no reason for criti-
cism of the present organization
for Womens Athletics by comment
upon the situation in previous years.

Constructive criticism is always
welcome, and whenever possible, is
acted upon.

Basketball Rules
Undergo Change

BASKETBALL RULE CHANGES

Absent from the basketball rules
for the 1946-47 season are any
major changes according to the
guide recently released by the
National Basketball Committee.
Four minor revisions were listed.
Pivot Change

1. A slight change in the pivot
rule now permits a player who
comes to a stop on the count of
two with neither foot in advance
of the other to pivot on either foot.
Formerly, he could lift either foot
but was required to get rid of the
ball before the lifted foot was re-
turned to the floor.

Jump Change

2. If the jumpers on a jump ball
simultaneously tap the ball out of
bounds, the ball is to be tossed
again six feet from the boundary
instead of being brought back to
the spot of the original jump.
Substitution

3. A player who has withdrawn
from the game after the official’s
intermission may return once. If
he withdraws again, he may not
return unless the game goes into
overtime.

’l‘imer Change

4. The watch is to be stopped
each time the ball becomes dead
after the last period officials’ in-
icrmlssion.

To the Editor:

Last week’s “ex-sorority letter
writer" stated, “It seems to me,
however, that replies were too gen-
eral, and specific answers were
avoided." ThezzstHCdff—wado-cm
ceeded to discuss the financial
obligations.

In the meeting when this sub-
ject was brought up, the freshmen
were told that it would be discussed
in a later meeting with Dean
Stokes. This was not to avoid the
question. The topic of discussion
was “Pros and Cons” of sororities.
Certainly, if finances were a "Con."
it was not the place of the “Pro”
speaker to bring it up. And if it
were as drastic as “ex-sorority
claims ,then it certainly would have
been brought up by the indepen-
dents. Since it was not brought up
as an argument against sororities.
it must not be a great issue.

This is a State College. Every
person attending it is causing some
financial pull on her family. It has
been this way since the college
began. The purpose of a State Col-
lege is to give education. tuition
free. And yet — sororities have
been on campus for forty years. Ex-
sorority didn’t approve of sororities
so she resigned. That privilege is
given to all.

As for living in a sorority house
all I can say is — you’ll never
realize how wonderful it is until
you’ve lived in one. It’s chummy.
true, and you’ve got a whole house
to study in. You don’t live in a
bedroom. Breakfast is at anytime
you want it. But if (ex-sorority
wanted to use the “house” as an
argument, she should have said.
“The sorority houses only hold
thirteen at the most. and all mem-
bers aren't fortunate enough to get
a chance to live there."

Discusses Art
Of Sculpturing

(Continued from Page 1,Colimm 3)

During an illness she was presented
with some sculptering material by

a friend. and with that gift she
made a likeness of the head of her
dog which won her a scholarship
to the Yale School of Fine Arts.
Since then she has done much
along the lines of portraiture anci
religious art, and has traveled all
over the country on lecture tours.

"I enjoy meeting so many dif—
ferent people, and have made sev-
eral friends in the places that I
visit often," she said. Her work has
also taken her to Mexico and Can—
ada, where she appears before
American groups, and she has
crossed the ocean 45 times.

The Belgian sculptrcss has a deep
regard for refugee children of this

tion when she came to America
during the lust World War, Mme.
Silv-el'cruys recalls that she did not
want to leave this country after
the end of hostilities because she
found much more freedom here.
“The younger children do not mind
going back. but the older ones, who
have begun to think. do not want
to leave."

The mighty edifices of State

But now a new precedent

for this tradition will symbolize

Not only will it serve as a token

This year, Mr. Maurice Weiss

Attribute Teacher Strikes Protests

PAOI 3

To Low Wages In Education Field

Conferences, storms of protest.
walkouts. demands for higher wages
and strikes have been sweeping
education circles during the past
few months. All these problems are
basically the results of extreme low
teacher salaries which have pre-
vailed throughout the country for
years.

According to the United States
Statistical Abstract for 1930 the
average salary of teachers in ele-
mentary and secondary schools
back in 1870 was $189 a year, which
gradually rose to $1364 in 1926. The
National Education Association
published figures in 1927 showing
that the average annual income of
all gainfully employed persons in
the United States was $2,110.

In 1935 the Association found
that of the most favored group,
teachers in large cities, the average
woman after 40 years of service,
might hope to have an annuity
yielding $58 per month. The top
5 per cent of teachers had an
annual salary of $1800. Thousands
were earning less than $1000. Sta-
tistics in 9142-43 for high school
teachers in cities of over 100,000
population showed an average of
$2.887 per year.

increase During War

During the war. salaries showed
a slight increase and the median
salaries of teachers was raised
twelve per cent. Though Boards of
Education recognized the problems
with which teachers were faced the
30 per cent rise in the cost of living,
made the raise unnoticeable.

Last spring a campaign was
waged by the National Education
Associations. individual teachers
and laymen to bring to the at-
tention of the State Legislature the
necessity for increased salaries for
teachers. This campaign was back-
ed by organizations such as the
State Congress of Parents and
Teachers and the School Boards
Association, the American Associa-
tion of University Women. and
other groups interested in better
schools.

aid to the 1939 level. but even so
the State assumes not quite one
third of the obligation to support
schools. Since the State mandates
teacher preparation and certifica-
tion, the question has been raised
as to why it does not mandate
minimum salaries also.

During the last twa weeks in
August. delegates from thirty na-
tions met in Endicott, New York, to
consider ways in which organized
teachers in all lands could help
build a peaceful world. This con-
ference was planned and organized
by the National Education Asso-
ciation and a draft constitution of
four points was drawn up for the
world organization of the teaching
profession.

Platforms Support Increases

Both the Democratic and Re-
publican state platforms for the
recent election contained definite
statements on education and the
teaching profession.

Perhaps these developments are
the ben‘innlng of a stronger educa-
tional system. Nevertheless, in an
address at the close of the Endicott
Conference Dr. Willard E. Givens
hailed the action as the beginning
of a new era in education in the
field of world understanding and
good will.

“Let us work together in building
a strong, effective organization of
the teaching profession. It will
not be easy to do this. but, God
helping us, we can follow no other
course."
