Green To Urge

Flu Innoculation

Dr. Matie L. Green, College
Physician, will speak in assembly
this morning urging all students to
be innoculated for influenza during
Thanksgiving vacation in order to
prevent susceptibility to the epi-
demic which is expected this win-
ter. Nominations will be made for
a MAA Representative at Large,
voting will take place for the
Junior Prom Queen, and a short
movie will be shown.

According to Dr. Green, people
in the medical profession are ex-
pecting an epidemic this winter and
the general opinion is that stu-
dents should be innoculated to
prevent later illness. During the
past few weeks, many schools, col-
leges. and industrial plants have
been urging their students and em-
ployees to have these innoculations.
MAA Representatives

Nominations for the MAA Repre-
sentative at Large will be open un-
til the Wednesday after Thanks-
giving vacatlon, and they must be
scaled and signed before placing
them in the Myskania mailbox.
