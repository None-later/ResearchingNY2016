Basketball Season Returns

With the end of Thanksgiving vacation comes
basketball season. The team has been practicing
for some time and now all they need is the full
support of the student body.

 

Last year the raspy voices and sore throats after
each game bore testimony to the spirit displayed.
The spirit shown at the beginning of the season
overwhelmed even the players. However, towards
the end of the season, the enthusiasm, although
good, did not equal the initial attempt.

A basketball team presented a novelty to State
students. Things like basketball teams went out
with the war. Let’s take advantage of their peace-
time return. We supported them fast year, but
they’ll need just as much and more support this
year.

Working against great odds, State‘s team played
a terrific season last year. This year with condi-
tions back to normal an even better season presents
itself. With schools like Hartwick, Slcna, St, Mi-
chael’s, and Brooklyn l’oly Tech appearing on the
schedule, the season shows great promise. In pro-
portion, according to mathematical logic, the dis—
play of spirit should be greater.

Let’s get back of our team and keep 1111 the spirit
throughout the season!

Protection From Fallacy

Lately, we have heard adverse criticism about
the validity 11f items appearing in the Nitws, cent-
ering mainly about incorrect presentation 11f facts.

liach news item is checked carefully many times
before its final appearance in the paper, for content.
as well as typographical errors. 11111 we can pre-
sent only those facts which arc givcn to our rc-
porters. If they are handed to as incorrect, that is
the way they will appear in the ans

it is imperative that those who supply the i11-
formation be sure of the correctness 11f their facts
as well as those who write and check them.

VITA'I‘I COLLIGI’ NIWI.

FRIDAY. Novena“ :2. rue

 

 

We hate to return to reality when

VWe find the portrayal of humanity

at its best on‘the stage. Tuesday
evening the curtain rose, the gamut
was run, we applauded. We saw
flashes of acting plus directing at its
height in Page Hall Auditorium.

Lee Chetham, interpreting the his-
torically famous Juliet, took advant-
age to the full of every emotional
moment with warmth and truthful-
ness. Her Juliet was extremely
young, but also extremely consistent.
She moved with an inspired impulse
right up to her death scene.

The Romeo created by Collins
was graceful and sincere during his
first two appearances. However, not
once did we see that spark of fire
so essential for the concluding scene.
His suicide was an incongrulty be-
cause Romeo, as we saw him, was
incapable of the pain and intensity
needed for his last act. In the first
stanza Romeo became an "actor"
with a prop in his hand.

Friar Lawrence could not have
been the character Martin'Bush gave
us. The very words and obvious kind
purpose of the Friar were contra-
dicted by this pompous and affected
“quoting” of Shakespeare.

The give and take between the
actors generally, was excellent. An
example was the nurse’s scene when
Chetham and aunting, ailing Ar-
leen Riber built a delightful cres—
cendo. The tableaus, Mary Rose,
were splendid. The balcony, Jaffer,
was the prop of the play.

Next we shot with a boom of
thunder into fantasy. We shook
hands with the gods, made merry
and learned a lesson.

KENNY

The message of the play, of course,
was the authors, but the adapta-
tion and method of delivery were
Hal Gould’s. We would like to thank
Hal for an exciting and highly com-
mendable production. Advancement
would be impossible without path-
finders. Hal gave us an experiment,
not a completely finished perform-
ance. Lighting killed transitions,
prop moving broke moods, beautiful
fade outs came a moment too late
or too soon. But still, it was a suc-
cess because of its unity. Every
sound effect, every characterization
moved with a purpose. This play
could easily have become fanical at
high moments, but it never did be-
cause it was guided by too strong
a hand.

We liked everything about the
play. The off-stage voices propped
up among us in gay reparte. The
tempo cluttered along smoothly. The
bolt of lightening and the army
manouvers were masterpieces. We
liked the musical backgrounds. In
fact, John Lube deserves special
mention as sound effects man.

Barcelou’s unperturbable Nick,
with his flute, was a fellow we’d like
for a next door neighbor. The three
gods fulfilled their regality and
their depth of understanding until
they became more “human” than
the men and women on stage. Fred
Barron, as a prosecutor. again stole
the scene. Warren Reich gave us an
hilarious characterization. Indeed,
every personality on stage was an
individual. We liked the contrasts.
Yet no one dominated. Descent of
the Gods was a purposeful unit.

We come. we saw, we were con-
quered.

reorganize Myskania into something

explained that this was merely to

Synopsis of Course No. VIII

When HEPZIBAH PEABODY, dull pupil in Miss
MINNIE SLOTKIN’s Public School No. 44 (and IA)
decided she would like to be ASSEMBLY SPEAKER,
she encountered a little OPPOSITION (In the form
of ANGELINE ALLBRIGHT and BENNIE BUR-
LAP. HEPZIBAH, confidant that she would win,
was out in the anteroom testing her voice when Miss
ROSETTA STONE (the teacher) announced the
victory. As the STUDENTS marched into the As-
SEMBLY, Miss STONE walked up to the nervous
candidates and opened her MOUTH. “The Speaker
for the week,” said Miss STONE, “is” . . .

. . . “Bennie Burlap."

Angeline Allbright congratulated Bennie Burlap.
Hepzibah said, “Drop dead." and walked out.

She stood reluctantly as Bennie led the group in
the Oath of Allegiance (which was what she aspired
to do most of all), and she slumped deep into her
plush-lined Assembly seat as he introduced Miss
Minnie Slotkin. After Assembly she went home.

At home, she brooded. It wouldn't have been so
bad, she mused. if Angeline got elected—Angeline was
a girl—but that Bennie Burlap—he was a. boy if she
ever saw one.

Why, wondered Hepzibah, did a boy get elected when
the girls had two candidates and the boys had only
one? Don't the girls have twice as much chance
of winning with tw0 candidates as they would have
had with just one?

She voiced her convictions to Angeline the next
Monday in the lunchroom. Bennie, who was sitting
at the next table ovorheard and began to laugh.
"Halt!" jeered Bennie in Hepzibah’s direction. “Are
girls stoopld!”

On Thursday, hte girls of the Third Grade did
something during nominating period to show the
boys that; Girls of the Third Grade were not stoopid.
They nominated three girls. This time they were con-
fident of winning, especially since the boys had nom-
inated only one candidate again.

Hepzlbah, whose name was on the slate once more,

 

' was a little dubious this time. And she had good rea-

son to be—she lost. (So did the other two girls.)

It was over the week-end, which she spent in bed,
that Hepzibah wised up. She was studying Florin-
sky’s "Law of Election Returns in the Elementary
Schools” when it came to her. She picked up the
telephone from her little plaid night table and dialed
tl‘o girls of the third grade.

During the next nominating session, the boys nom-
inated one candidate. Billy Bullflnch. The girls, hav-
ing been enlightened by Miss Hepzibah Peabody, nom-
inated Miss I-.epzibah Peabody—and then they nom-
inated Joe Smith. Joe Smith's mouth fell open. The
boys' mouths fell open. The nominations were closed.

The next day, five minutes before Assembly, Miss
Rosetta Stone announced the results. “This week,” she
said, "we have our first Woman Speaker of the As-
sembly!" And her eyes were merry (for was she not
a woman herself?)

The first Woman Speaker of the Assembly mounted
the stairs to the stage and proudly introduced Miss
Slotkin. Then she led the Oath of Allegiance. Her eyes
shone and her lips quivered as she shouted, (in a
patriotic fervor.1 “I PLEDGE A LEGION TO THE
FLAG OF THE UNITED STATES, AND TO THE
REPUBLIC OF RICHARD SANDS. ONE NATION
AND A VEGETABLE . . ."

Holding her gently by the hair. Miss Minnie Slotkin
removed Hepzlbah from the stage.

The next week the girls of the Third Grade retired
permanently from public life. Politics, they decided.
was a man's game after all.

students, debated for Hartwick.

required courses.”

The RPI band greeted the State

out 01' their car in Troy. Rita Sha-
piro. '47. and Samuel Scott. '47. de—
batcd on the negative side: Resolved:
“That Technical Education fits one

Red Bulls Plus Purple Balls
Yield Molecules Of NoCI

Who ever heard of a mole-
cule of sodium chloride com-
posed of little red and purple
balls? That is the latest project
in Dr. Oscar E. Lanford's Phys-
ical Chemistry class.

It would appear that it takes
atoms of sodium (the little red
balls) and atoms of chlorine
(little purple ball) put together
in a special sort of way to make
a molecule of sodium chloride—
.salt to you. Confusing, isn’t it?

They are planning to photo-
graph the finished product in
colors, so if you want to View
the appearance of a grain of
salt take a look at that picture.
01 course, that matter in your
table Shaker may not be quite
as bright and colorful, but looks
can be deceiving! Anyway, if

This year. as every other year,

To The Editor:

A bunch of fresh are headed
toward the Lounge. They want to
discuss plans for the weekend date,
parties. movies and such trivia.

"Ah," [hey if urc, “those nice
comfortable couches will feel so
comfortable after those hard, gran-
ite-like chairs."

On clltci'lng the Lounge, these
50‘crs find each of the couches o:-
cuped by 11 sleeping figure. Undis-
11111ycd, they collect 11 low chairs
together and begin to talk. The
discussion ends soon as the group
gropos for the (1001'. Their lungs

Of course everyone knows that
thc Lounge is to be used for social
groups 11nd 111111. sleeping, is not 111—

Why do 111-1111111 slot-p, and not con-

A very simple answer is that the
