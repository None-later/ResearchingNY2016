class.

Marion Zlmmer wrote her poem
one night this summer while she
was working at. the Thousand-Is-

Campus Coeds Considered
Charming, Cooperative,,Cuie

Do Union and RP! men pre-
fer college or non-college girls
for their dates? What do they
think of the Skidmore, Sage,
Albany State and Vassar coeds
as date material?

Monday night on Campus Re-
view men from RPI and Union
aired their feelings on the above
topic. Cheer up girls and let
that light shine forth from your
eyes! They are very much in
favor of the coed as a compan-
ion for an evening of fun! Why?
Well, it seems that the average
college girl is more friendly,
definitely a better conversa-
tionallsts, broader minded and
note: they have a definite sense
of cooperation. A girl’s person-
ality counted more than beauty,
but the fellows do not care to get
stuck with “Lena the Hyena”.

It seemed that Union liked
Skldmore best because it is their
"sister college," but mainly be-
cause the girls are more friendly.
(The master of ceremonies pre-
ferred the Vassar Girls!)

 

 

 

Moose Attends
Science Meeting

At Columbia U

Dr. Carleton A. Moose, Assistant
Professor and Supervisor in science,
attended the Conference on Educa-
tion of Teachers in Science at the
Teachers College of Columbia Uni»
versity Friday and Saturday, No—
vember 15, 16. The Eastern Zone of
the New York State Association will
held its conference in the Lounge
at 10:00 A.M. tomorrow.

There were representatives from
colleges from Maine to Alabama at
the conference at Columbia. This
was the first conference held since
the outbreak of the war. Before the
war there were two conferences held
yearly, one in the spring and the
other in the fall. One of these is al-
ways hech at Columbia, the other
being held at some other college
campus in the northeastern U. 8.

Although the general purpose of
this first conference was that of
reorganization. the main purpose
of all of these conferences is teach-
er science education. The spring
conference of 1947 will be held eith—
er ln Trenton, New Jersey or in the
District of Columbia.

There were two main speeches,
one concerning the peacetime uses
of atomic energy. and the other on
the medical and physiological uses
of atomic radiations which dealt
with the biological effects of the ra—
cliations.

The National Society for the
Study of Education will publish its
46th issue which will discuss science
education.

Professor H. Emmett Brown, of
Buffalo College gave a report on
the new science building which Buf-
falo College is undertaking.

It was announced that a Field
Conference will be held at Plymouth
College June 9-Jnly ~i for anyone
who is interested in the field scien—
ces. Last summer this conference
was held at. Bard College.

in regard to the ranking of State
College with other colleges in Scien-
ce Edttcution, Dr. Moose said, "Our
program colnpurcs Very favorably
with the programs of other colleges
represented at the meeting. I think
our people lmvc a much better back-
ground in straight science."

At the Eastern Zone Conference
of New York State Teachers Asso—
ciation, Dr. Moose will report on
the progress of the committee on
curriculum improvements in New
York State. which is financed by the,
(icncrul Electric Company. llr. Curl
('luthc, llircclor of the State Mll-
scum. will speak on the educational
St'l'vlt't-s offered by the museum.

Signum Loudis
Elects Members
To Organization

Thirteen additional members of
the Class of 1947 have been elected
to Signum Laudis, the honorary
scholastic fraternity composed of
those Seniors who rank among the
highest ten per cent of their class
in academic standing. Announce-
ment of these new members was
made in assembly last Friday by Dr.
John M. Sayles, President of the
college.

These thirteen members, together
with ten named last spring, consti-
tute 8 per cent of the Senior Class.
The new members are Joan Alver-
son, Edward Cohen, Ettore Gradoni,
Dorothy Hladlk, Justine Lewis,
Gloria Pirowski, Rosalie Pooler, Ruth
Reynolds, Alan Stone, Mary Tessier,
Warren Walker, Helen Ziembic, and
Calvin Zippen.

List last year‘s nominees

Those who were named last spring
were Ruth Bently, Thelma Carlson,
Helen Caughran, Gertrude Casper
Girvin, Shirley Knights, Elizabeth
Margot, Elizabeth McDowell, Doris
Quinn, Charlotte Roscoe, and Her-
bert Weiner.

The Signum Laudis Scholarship
prize of $20 is awarded annually to
the Senior with the highest scholas-
tic average, this student automa-
tically becoming the president of
the society for the next year. This
year the prize went to Thelma Carl-
son, whose average is 2.89.

A reception for the new members
was held in the library at Van Der-
zee Hall last night from 7:30 to 9
P. M.

Exhibit-ﬂame
Plant Drawings

La Plante Exotique, a collection
of reproductions of drawings and
paintings of foreign plants by the
French artist, Mathurin Mehcut.
will be on display the week of De-
cember 2 on the second floor of Dra-
per. Ruth I—Iutchins, Head of the
Art Department, will arrange the
exhibit.

Mt. Meheut, a naturalist as well
as an artist, travelled a great deal
and studied plants from all parts of
the earth. Many paintings of the
plants he studied were compiled in
this collection. Among these are
paintings of the bamboo of Indo—
China. India and Japan, the dasyl—
lrion of Mexico, the phllodcndron of
Brazil, and the yucca of Texas and
Mexico. All the paintings are vivid
in coloring and represented in de-
tuil.

This exhibition will be valuable
to both botany students and art
students. according to Miss Hutch-
lns. Botany students, who arc in-
terested in the study of foreign and
tropical plants, have the opportunity
to see representations of many rare
plants whose pictures are seldom
found in the textbooks.

 

State-Mint

By HARLAND

There was many a blue expression
in Syracuse last weekend as the Col-
gate Red Raiders reigned supreme
after their annual game there. Syra-
cuse, definitely the favorite follow-
ing their victory over Cornell the
week before, bowed their heads and
came back to earth again.

With only a few more games left
in this year’s gridiron season the
eyes of sport fans are already turn-
ing to the New Year's day classics.
The Orange Bowl committee hopes
to be able to present an Army game,
but it will not be known definitely
until after Thanksgiving whether
the Cadets will accept. If so, Army’s
opponents will probably be either
Georgia Tech or Tennessee.

Speaking of sports, a varsity bas-
ketball team is being formed at

none other than Russell Sage. No,
it's not the tactics in the spotlight
this time. It's their new masculine
section ready to take their share of
glory along with the feminine popu-
lace.

Looking to the social side of the
picture I notice that the freshman
class at Brockfort State Teachers
College is already making plans for
its Christmas formal. The Sophs are
also basking in the glory of a very
sucsessful dungaree dande a short
while ago. It seems State isn't the
onlf place to go rustic with its in-
formal dances.

Now for the lighter side of the
picture here’s an item from The St.
[Rona Venture:

“There are three classes of women,
the intellectual, the beautiful and
the majority."

Obituary

Kilroy is dead, or at least so re-
ports the “Daily Texan." It seems
that Kilroy was enrolled at the Uni-
versity of Minnesota under the G. I.
Bill but one day he met his death,
trampled under the saddle shoes of
a surge of co-eds leaving class. Min-
nesota students said of him that he
was “one who had made his mark in
the world, whose signature is more
familiar than that of John Han-
cock.“ Kilroy was buried on the catn-
pus with these words marking his
grave. "Kilroy is here."

Facts and Figures

The Chicago Teachers College pa-
per, Thc 'l‘cmpo, recently published
an editorial discussing teacher sal-
aries in Chicago as compared with
other cities. Here are a few of the
statistics: Starting grammar school
teachers there earn $1850 as com-
pared with a starting pay of $2310 in
Los Angcles; maximum elementary
school salary, Chicago—$2850, St.
Louis—$4100; high school maximum,
Cliicago——$395t), New York—$4850,
Newark—$5200.

This being Junior weekend we are
naturally interested to note that
proms are being held elsewhere this
month. At. the University of Roches-
ter fourteen contestants competed
for Junior prom queen last week-
end. the men going to the poles Fri-
day to vote for the lady of greatest
pulchritudc.

'l‘omorrow night it's our own Jun-
ior prom with dancing till 2 A.M. t0
the music of 811 Hannon. his clari-
HM. and his orchestra. Then too,
there‘s a square dance and a real
old-fashioned hayride tonight to
really put you in ll, mellow mood.
And then too there are two whole
days to recover before Thanksgiving
vocation appears on the scene.

By Quinn, Shapiro and Tichy

a Catasthrophe struck the PD. this
cek — reason -— THE JUNIOR
‘SUE. The Junior issue means
any things to everybody, but to
; e following members of the Sports
Staﬂ’ it means this:
' Sheehan, semester editor, a week’s
rest in the quiet and solitude of
Sayles Hall.

Day, co-editor, a bad break be-
cause she won’t have the week off
next semester,

Quinn, Shapiro and Tichy, an
additional “daffie” headache.

The sophomores, more troubles.

To the students at large, a new
experience in the field of literature

~ and reporting.

The Future
Seriously though, we sometimes
wonder if people around here re—

.twal e just how wonderful the Juniors

rally are. For instance, did you
, know that:

1. The Juniors of to-day will be
.the Seniors of tomorrow, the Sc-
.niors o‘f tomorrow will be the teach-
ers of the next day who will teach
children soon to be the leaders of
the new world. It therefore follotvs
‘ (logically, of course) that the Jun—
iors determine the future of the
world.

2. A Junior will be Junior Prom
Queen.

3. The Juniors of to-day will be
the Myskania members of next
year.

4. A Junior will be WAA presi-
dent next year.

5. The Juniors are looking for-
ward to a Senior Ball next year.
The Past

We hope this will giVe you :1.
slight idea of what a colossal class
the Juniors really are.

We feel at this point that it is
time to be more specific with re—
gard to the gigantic athletic
achievements of the class of ‘48.

Ping-pong. bowling, and softball
were crowning achievements of tho
“Daffies” in our freshmen year.
Let it be noted that two “iii-crs Wcrc
chosen that year to spark—plug
State’s WAA All—Star basketball
team.

Leaving “prescribed mathematics"
and troubled by Ed. to, we soplls
were not too confused to bc prevent-
ed from swumplng the class of ’49 in
rivalry. Hockey, basketball. ping-
pong, swimming, bowling and soft—
ball tallied the points for ‘48. The
softball score looked like u f0ot.-~
ball final as the sophs trounced tho
frosh 53-27, in only fivc innings of
play. Moving Up Day brought joy
and the Cup as we proudly bccunlc
"jolly juniors" and marched cn
masse to Punettu‘s.

Even though We jumors aren’t
in rivalry this year, we showed our
prowess by beating the seniors in
volleyball, and coaching the t'rosh
hockey team to a. victory over ‘40.

It has been brought to our ut-
tentlon that all of State Colu- u
may not be so enthusiastic about
this column as we are, so w to
satisfy them we have t‘tllltllst‘t'ndt‘d
to end this unproludiccd rcvicw of
athletic junior class, and turn to
other minor matters.

Noting the lack of interest in the
proposed lntra-mural basketball
league we set about to try to as-
certain what Were the reasons. We
asked a few statesmen what was
their opinion on the plan to or-
ganize the league on a departmen-
tal basis in hopes that we could find
out just what the men wanted.
Here are their comments and sug-
gestions:

’l‘erho: “It works better to have
the fellows make up their own
teams rather than have MAA or-
ganize the teams."

R. Merritt: “The Departmental
set-up will Work only if everyone
cooperates.”

Schick: “The departmental plan
is a stupid one. Use the method
used in the football league."

Gipp: “The fellows have been
waiting three years to play to—
;rethcr. Under the departmental
plan they will not be able to do so.”

R. Sullivan: “Will not operate
for the success of a competitive and
interest league.”

. Lang: “The departmental plan
is a good idea and should work.”

McGrnth: "There would be lack
of organization in a departmental
setup. I suggest the football league
plan be used." <

L. Taylor: “I think the depart-
mental plan ls definitely workable
because newcomers as well as the
majority of the men will have a
chance to play.”

J. King: "I don‘t see any ad-
vantage in the departmental plan
since there is little choice with
whom you will play.

Karpiak: “I think the class and
group team plan is better than the
departmental plan, One thing in
lover of the latter plan is that the
fellows would probably know the
others in their departments well.”
'Southard: “I think all should
sign up and the teams be picked
from this list to be of as nearly
equal strength as possible.”

George: “It tthc departmental
plan) doesn't. seem to be attracting
much interest."

llippick: “The departmental plan
seems to be a more just method of
organizmg the teams than a plan
such as the football league method."

’l‘uckcr: “I am definitely opposed
to the proposed plan. I think it
wouch be better for follows to pick
their own teams.”

McNamara: "Put me down as
vehemently opposed to the plan in
question. It is unworkable. Fel-
lows will not go all out for a de-.
partinan tcum."

Amyot: “I‘m against the pro-
posed plan. Men aren't evenly dis—
tributed in the departments.”

liottomlcy: “I think the class
teams are better than departmental
trains,"

Holstein: “Will work in some de—
purlmcnts but it scents to me there
is u. better system to be found."

PS. “Ernic-the-llcrmit. refused to
comment."

Smunmry: Of 23 interviewed, 17
expressed their disapproval, while
it were in favor of the plan.

Talk And Rally

John Dooley, ’47, publicity direc-
tor of MAA, has announced that a
pep rally will be held in the Page
Hall gym on Wednesday, December
4. This rally will mark the un-
official opening of the State Col-
lege basketball season as members
of the Varsity and Junior Varsity
appear for the first time as work-
ing units.

Coach Hathaway will give the
welcoming speech followed by a
short talk on the minor changes
which have occurred in the game
this year. The finer points of the
game will be outlined and explained
—giving a. clearer understanding of
the teamwork and co-ordination
needed to produce a fast-moving
and high-scoring team.

The members of the Varsity and
Junior Varsity will be introduced,
after which student Association
cheerleaders will lead the student
body in cheers and song. In con-
clusion, a short scrimmage will be
played by members of the teams.
a scrimmage that will bear the
fruits of a long, hard period of
practice. It is hoped that there
will be a large turnout for the pep
rally and that the old State College
spirit of the past will once again
resound through-out the walls of
Page Hall.

trying to top the time-tested
SOPHS. (That twisted the tounge
terrifically.)

Seventeen to nothing, frosh fa-
vor——that was the score—when
the Soph stars unleased the pent-
up power which they had held in
reserve while the fresh optimis-
tically held visions of victory.
Two, four, six, eight—up mounted
the Soph score as they held the
unwitty frosh from further scor-
mg.

Seventeen to seventeen, tension
tightened, 21-21, score still static.
Then the skillful Sophs stopped
the playful parly and batted the
ball with vivacious vigor to score
twice in succession. It was an-
other Sophomore victory as the
bewildered blue beanles bowed
in decisive defeat.

(Written by an unprejudlced
Soph)

PS. In case anyone's interested,
the fresh theoritlcally won the
game having held the Sophs to
an 11-0 shut-out.

With football slowly fading from
the sports limelight, basketball is
beginning to be the center of in-
terest. Evidences of this fact we
noted in the sports columns of the
local dailies with the announcement
that professional basketball is to get
under way as early as next week.

Also emerging from the obscure
corners of the sports sheet to take a
"front and center" is news of area
college cage teams.

Siena Stacked

Our scout reports that siena with
a varsity squad of twonty-eight, more
than half of which are experienced
performers, is showing classy form in
its scrimmages. The Loundonville
quintet are using the "zone" defense
almost exclusively and with an
abundance of six-footers will be a
tough evenings assignment for any
college five to tackle. Union has a.
veteran squad and judging from
early reports, are sure to have a
crack team.

Trojans

Moving over to Troy we find RPI
hard at work to win back the has-
ketball prestige it enjoyed in pre-
war days. A tough schedule is on
tap for the Engineers but reports
from Troy indicate that they are
pointing for a big season.

State Faces Union

Back home we find an aggressive,
hard-working squad eager to give
State a worthy representation in
its fast-approaching cage season.
Coach Hathaway has been experi-
menting with a “set” defense but is
hampered by lack of height. Dally
scrimmage sessions have been leng-
thened to prepare the squad for a
practice scrimmage with Union at
Schenectady, slated for late this
week. Coach Hathaway has been us-
ing a first squad made up of Mars-
land, Evans, Marzello, George and
O'Brien against several combina-
tions in an effort to get a smooth-
xorking and high-scoring starting

ve.

Merrit Jayvee Coach

In a move to improve the Junior
Varsity squad by personal super-
vision Coach Hathaway appointed
Paul Merritt, a grad student, to the
post of Jayvee coach. The Jayvee
squad have shown enthusiasm for
and eagerness to cooperate with
their new mentor.

NOTICE

Minnie, the yellow car wishes to
announce, contrary to the statement
made several weeks ago on this page
that she will not be available for
driving lessons. She extends her re-
grets to all those who have put in
applications.
