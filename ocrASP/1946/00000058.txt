Then, to the tune of musica
strains, the candidates, chosen only
for beauty, will enter. The queen
is supposedly the representative of
all winter activities, carrying out
the theme of the whole affair.

Christmas has its place in the
decorative scheme because if pos-

sible, a huge Christmas tree will

occupy a place of honor in the
middle of the floor. The brilliant
lights and decorations should serve

to accentuate the glistening white

of the rest of the background. In
fact. every winter sport and activ-
ity will have its own special place
except for Santa Claus. He will
be elsewhere preparing for his own
"big" night.

The headaches of being chairman
of the dance and of the decorations
have gone to Harold Weber, while
Philip Lashinsky took over the task
of securing Gus Metro’s orchestra.
Arrangements are completely in the
hands of William Baldwin.

Bids will sell for $2.40 at the
stamp booth in the lower hall of
Draper next week. Remember, they
represent your,entrance to a gala
evening and the girls have until
three o'clock to enjoy themselves.

 

Bans Not Banished, Bellows
Angry Campus Commission

Campus Commission is worried
again. (By June there should be
a surplus of grey hairs.) Don't
you know you can't smoke in the
lounge, or the gym, or the lower
hall of Draper? And speaking of
Draper, that’s where the mail-
boxes are. For heaven's sake, as
well as Mary Jane Carver's, don’t
put 3 by 5 cards in the student
mail. (Hillel, Primer, and Inter-
Varsity, hint. hint!)

Now we will take up the little
matter of the mimeograph. There
comes a time in the life of all
good students, practice teachers,
longer obtain service for free
longer obtain the service for free.
“Those who wish to use the mim-

quired to pay 3.25 for the first
hundred copies, and $.10 for every
hundred after that. Please con-
tact Beverly Slttig. And accord-
ing to the notice, “This means

pleasant thought. Lost and Found
