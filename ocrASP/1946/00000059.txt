Thanks -- For Nothing . . .

All but a handful of the intellegentsia here seem
to think that “pep” is a breakfast cereal and noth-
ing more, judging by the large crowd of 30 specta-
tors which dribbled into the gym for Wednesday’s
rally.

With the first game of our ’46-’47 season only a
few days away, a mere 2.3% of the total student
body considered it worthwhile to show up and
support the team in its first public appearance.
When an important sports event comes out second
in competition with the library, which attracted
about 75 during the same time, things have reached
a pretty low ebb.

We grant that Wednesday night is not the ideal
time to drag people away from their homework. The
same applies of Tuesday, however, and yet the
AD plays never seem to lack an adequate audience.
And furthermore, it didn’t take 20-20 vision to
read the posters and news stories publicizing the
event.

We are forced to conclude that in spite of the
fact that most students knew about the rally, they
did not choose to devote an hour of their time in
support 0/ State’s second varsity team since the
end of the war.

If this is an indication of the spirit that will pre-
. vail throughout the year, the team might as well
give up now instead of playing to half-empty bleach-
ers for,therhext four months. We believe that sports
are an important part of any college program both
as a unifying force and as a tangible evidence of
school spirit. This is especially true here, where
a heavy emphasis on scholarship needs some non-
academic complement.

What has happened since last year to make
more than 1,000 students do such a complete about
face? For if you will just recall- last May’s budget
assembly you may remember that MAA received
over $4,000, the largest appropriation granted to
any organization, to develop its sports program.
And $2,598 was slated exclusively for basketball!
If the sport was worth that much money last Spring
there is no reason why it is not worth our active
support this winter.

There is still time to make up in part for Wed-
nesday’s farce. The Alumni game will officially
open the season tomorrow night in the gym, and
the turnout—in spite of fonnai dinners—will be a
clear indication of what we can expect in the future.
It’s up to you—what’s the verdict?

Presents, Please . . .

State’s third annual drive to provide gifts and
entertainment for children at the Albany Orphans’
home opens today under the sponsorship of Mys-
kania.

The last two events have been very successful,
and we have it on good authority that the kids
really appreciate the effort. Excellent cooperation
has made it possible to provide each child with at
least three or four small presents, refreshments and
an evening of entertainment.

We do not believe it will be necessary to urge
anyone to purchase his gift during the next week
Therefore, let this serve merely as a reminder that
prompt action in buying a present and accuracy
in labeling it will make things much easier for
everyone concerned.

The Common-Stator to given the widest latitude as author of this

column, although his Mempoiute do
State College Newa.

(Add to above: nor do they nec-
essarily reflect majority opinions,
and in many cases, not his own.)
But opinions are important factors
in any society in which an individ-
ual can be known a such.

In another column in this week's
NEWS can be found some notes re-
garding veterans and assemblies.
The fact that a number of people
this week received notices from the
office because of excessive assembly
cuts makes this apropos.

Waste of Time

The majorty of our assembly pro-
grams are but a waste of time. Wit-
ness our last two abortive programs.
Last minute substitutions were made
when Davis the Magician was un-
able to appear, and again when an-
other organization failed to put on
its program. There may have been
a legitimate reason for this, but the
fact remains that we were compelled
to attend and waste two hours at
these make-shift affairs. 2,000 man
hours of study, that is.

Complaints are made that the
vets sit in assembly and disturb that
which is going on by not paying at-
tention, by talking during announce-
ments and speeches, etc. We do not
tolerate this, nor is there any jus-
tification for it from a seemingly
mature group of people.

Nor are we able to accept the com-
pulson to attend the low-calibre,
nonsensical, time-wasting programs
in assembly with an open eye on our
time budget.

Need Business Meetings

Admittedly there are times when
it is expedient for the whole stu-
dent body to meet in order to con-
duct business, or hear reports from
members of the administration. We
believe that such meetings should be
compulsory for everyone, practice
teachers not occupied during that
hour, vets, and also graduates.

Our suggestion is this: [act's cut

not necessarily reﬂect those of the

out the unnecessary gallimaufry in
assembly. The NEWS may not be
able to sing announcements, but it
will print them. If assemblies must
be compulsory (a bitter word, that).
let's make them interesting enough
so that those awful veterans won't
sit back there and mess things up.
Or if this is impossible, let’s make
assembly optional, and have a com-
pulsory monthly business meeting.

(Oh yes, the Com-Stat doesn't
have a seat for assembly, so drop
that indignant colored pencil softly
now.)

“Unkind to Vets”

This being Unkind to Veterans
Week, and with your kind indul-
gence, may we cement on another
matter . . .

It seems to be the opinion held
by more than one person in school
that the vets are automatically given
the upper positions on the marking
curves. “Oh, you’ve been thru the
wars, you’ll get your A or B."

Pick up any commentary on the
status and application of vets to
their studies on any campus, and
read that they are applying them-
selves to their work much more dili-
gently than they did during their
first try. Dean Nelson mentioned this
fact several weeks ago when he said
that undoubtedly the majority of
the men are anxious to make up for
lost time, that they are applying the
experience they received from mili—
tary service, and that many have
additional responsibilities which
they didn't have before.

The current coal strike is just

QWW

 

 

To the Editor:

The time has come for State Col-
lege to examine its inter-collegiate
program. To act now is to leave room
for improvement this year — not
sometime in the future.

For many years, State college ath-
letics have been hampered by an at-
titude of complacency. The students
have half-heartedly supported a
program that has been inadequate
and as antiquated as the buildings.
This program is rapidly losing mo-
mentum and coming to a halt.

Why does State have varsity ath-
letics? Is it just because it is con-
ventional? Or do we want the school
to be represented by a team which
would be worthy of the financial and
moral support of the student body?

If we assume the former, the day
is not too for distant when State will
be forced to withdraw from inter-
collegiate competition. Why? Be-
cause the day has gone when we
can depend on a hit-and-run sys-
tem for procuring athletics.

If we assume the latter to be
true, what is wrong. and what can
we do about it?

Prior to 1940, State College put
a fair basketball team on the floor.
It won its share of games and even
managed a sensational victory over
Niagara. But. with the advent of
1940....sad days. The remaining pre-
war teams were pathetic. They lost
to an average Siena team by forty
points. I hope I never see another
game like that. Niagara beat State
by fifty points. They were good
teams, yes, but they weren't that
much better. SEVEN YEARS AGO
State had a fairly good team. Since
then, they won three, and sometimes
only one, game per season. Where-
upon the school quit the team cold.
Empty seats were in evidence at a
victory over St. Michael's.

That was the scene at State. What
was the story at other state col-
leges? Plattsburgh drubbed us twice,
while Onconta gave Siena a terrific
battle and they have far less men
on campus than State.

What can we do about this? We
can organize a program to make our
alumni conscious of our needs. Any
successful school has a loyal, vig-
orous alumni that points athletic
material our way. Let's use our

alumni association and its quarterly.

Success won't come quickly. nor '

easily, but it will come.

We must provide incentive for fel-
lows to play ball at State. We must
get them here, and then make it
possible for them to stay here. That
means a close relationship between
the P'I'EB and the physical educa-
tion department. A good example
would be to contact assemblymen for
the same jobs that have meant so
much to so many men at State in
the past.

Do I recommend subsidization?
No, I mean an intelligent and prac-
tical approach to a problem that de-
mands attention. To provide fifteen
men this way each year would be the
answer to our problem. No big-time
athletics. But respectable teams that
can meet our opponents on an even
basis.

One more point. We need a tradi-
tional rival. Our schedule this year
provided a succession of teams to be
played. No high points. Just names.
We need a traditional rival to liven
interest.

Some years from now. maybe
sooner, a new gym will come to
State. That means 2800 seats. If we
have a respectable team, the Albany
people would attend the games. And
there you have a source of revenue.

Sports will come high in the fu-
ture. Losing teams will provide a
terrific strain on the student bud-
get. A winning team could help it
immeasurably. Is that not incentive
enough for action?

It is time for the students to do
something about these conditions.
We allowed a rotten situation to be-
come progressively worse. Don't be
deluded by a few victories last year
over opponents that didn't belong on
a college court. And we can't (it-pend
on another rush of returning vet-
erans. Things won't improve by
themselves.

MAA. Student Council. and Mys-
kania are logical choices to head
this program. If one of those groups
doesn't not soon. backed by an inter-
ested student body, alumni, and ad—
ministration, tho class of 1050 is
doomed to some awful dcbaclcs on
the Page Hail court.

just let him ride perched on a suitcase in that sec-
tion of the train labeled “Passengers are prohibited

To protect yourself from the blazing blizzard. the
recommendation is one‘ pair of long white johns—
slightly speckled with grey. These can be purchased
from the Army War Surplus store, 001812 Union Street,
Chill Blane. You won't be the first to try them.

In running through the Atlantic’s list of Christmas
books (we was desprit) we find that they suggest for
Father—“Lost Men of American History;" for Mother
——-“People Behave Like Ballads" (the Martin's and the

for the whole family—“Thieves in the Night!"

While everyone breathed a silent prayer for Army
(or maybe Navy) last Weekend, few eyes were focused
on a team that has a record that even outshines that
of Army a. The Blue Hens of the University of Dela-

This may be a little out of our line, but several quer~
ies have attracted our attention. Why do most votcl‘ml‘i
pick assemblies to assume their “holler than thou"
attitudes? Faith withoit good works, as enjoyment
without participation, is of no avail . . . maybe we're

The Albany weatherman greeted
us with a cold wintry blast, our profs
welcomed us with plain hard work
and WAA brightened up our lives
with a grand new display on their
bulletin board.

It’s a, “lovely bulletin board” (un-
quoteWAA) with rely-poly snow men
skiing down snow-covered hills and
fancy ice-skaters gliding about in
swirling snow flakes. In view of the
frigid weather in Albany. we might
say that WAA understands the
meaning of “the psychological mo-
ment". Congratulations on a really
fine effective display H

We Were hoping we could extend
our congratulatory department to
include the Wednesday night pep
rally, but, unfortunately, it lends
itself more to criticism than to
praise. We hope that members of
the student body who disappointed
the team, then, will make up for it
by attending the opening game to-
morrow night in great numbers.

Ordinarily, the college halls are
a beehive of activity these nights
with crowds of people running about.
In addition to the “fourth estate”,
casts and directors of the AD. plays,
crews from the stagecraft class,
gym-bound traffic of both sexes, and
S. L. candidates headed for Gideon
Hawley Hall provide constant traf-
fic. There is always a group of in-
terested spectators besides. who come
to see what ’5 going on. Yet, only a
few dozen students managed to at-
tend the pep rally. The team de-
serves our support. Let's give it to
them!

Fast McEncny Oilers

Get out your scorecards, dust off

Basketball’s back and State has got
it! Tomorrow night is the night,
and 8:30 the time when state un-
veils the 1946 editions of her cage
teams. The first whistle will ring
in the season when the Purple and
Gold of State clash head-on with
the State College Alumni All-Stars.
The Junior Varsity will get their
first workout at 7:00 when they
meet the McEneny Oilers in the
preliminary.

Probable Starting Five

In the right back court holding
down one guard position will be
William D. (“Bole”) Marsland, ’47.
The rangy Amityville, Long Island
star, is counted on to be the main
cog in State’s defense plans. Start-
ing his third campaign in the Pur-
ple and Gold of State's Varsity.
“B010” is out to make the '46-’47
season his best. Twenty-three years
of age and standing 5’ 11”, the Air
Corps veteran can outjump and out-
maneuver opponents of
greater height, under the boards.

Paired with Marsland in the left 

back court will be Malcolm (“Red”)
Evans, '47. Tipping the scales at
175 and standing 5’ 9”. “Red” hails
from Yorktown Heights, N. Y.,
where three years’ competition in
the fast Metropolitan Area Lea-
gue, with Rye High School. preped
him for college play. A hard fight-
er and team-man, the Army vet—
eran is sure to be a valuable asset
to the team in this, his second,
Varsity season.

In the center slot Saturday night
will be John L. (“Long Jack") Kir-
by, ’48. Fredonia State College’s
gift to State holds 170 pounds on
a lofty 6’ 3” frame. Coming from
Remsen. N. Y., where he held down
a varsity basketball position, “Long
Jack" will give State's opponents
plenty of trouble with his skill in
getting the ball off the boards. Jack
saw service in the Naval Air Corps
before donning the Purple and Gold.

Playing In the front right court
at the first whistle, Walter J.
("Walt") Schick, '49. starts his first
game in State livery. The former
Bay Shore, L. I.. captain and star,
brings to state a service record
which includes action with the
crack 'ilst Signal Group Team.
champions of the Southern France
Theatre in the E.T.O. Twenty-two
years of age and tipping the scales
at 169, the 5' 9” veteran specializes
in one-handed push shots from the
corners.

In the other forward post Ken-
neth L. ('Ken") George, ’50, will
perform. The 5’ 6” freshman
makes up in speed what he lacks
in height. Coming to State from
Philip Schuyler High. Ken played
veteran of Navy service. "Karp'
was a star eager for Averill Park
High of Watervliet and was selected
for the all-league team two years
running.

Supplying valuable reserve
strength at the other guard slot is
Nolan R. (“Nolo”) Powell, '49.
“Nolo” saw plenty of action in
three years play for his home high
school at North Rose, N. Y. Twen-
ty-two years of age. the rangy
guard puts his 6’ of height and 180
pounds to good use in keeping the
opponents away from the State
goal. His service of three years
was with the Army pnratroops.

Slated For Action

Backing up Kirby at the center
post, is Thomas P. (“0.3.”) O'Brien,
’50. Towering 6’ 1”, the twenty-
year-old “O.B." gives State a classy
reserve at the key center slot. Tom
played two years of varsity ball at
Van Rensselaer before Uncle Sam
offered him Navy service.

No. 2 right forward is another
freshman, Seymore (“Cy”) Fersh.
Packing 180 pounds on a 6’ 1”
frame, the 20-year-old “Cy” can
play a full game without apparent
loss of energy. The former Pough-
keepsie High captain kept his bas-
ketball "eye" sharp while in the
service by performing with the fast
Ft. Knox. Ky. Post team which
played the best college competition
Kentucky had to offer.

Abraham L. (“Link”) Marzello,
'50, is State's other reserve forward.
Fast and shifty on his feet. the
twenty-year-old, 5' 6” forward is
valuable to a team employing the
fast break such as State plans to
use extensively. Hailing from
Troy, "Link" played two years of
varsity ball at Lansinghurgh High
before entering the Navy.

Basil R. (“Karp”) Karpiak, '50,
supplies one-half of State’s reserve
strength at the guard posts. The
youngest member of the squad,

Blanket Invitation

In an informal letter sent to all

male grads this week, MAA invited
its former members to help get the
basketball season underway in true
State style. The invitation stressed
the fact that Athletics have once
again reurned to the State campus.
With the greatly increased male en-
rollment this year, M.A.A. is inaugur-
ating an all-out program to place
the college on an athletic level com-
parable to that enjoyed by schools
of similar size. To acquaint each
loyal alumnus with the various
phases of reorganization and expan-
sion now under way. M.A.A. extend-
ed to each alumnus an invitation
to attend the slated alumni week-
end.

Saturday Program

The informal gathering will get

under way at 2:30 in the Lounge

basketball games, the preliminary
game between the State Jayvees and
the McEney Oilers slated for 7:00.
The Alumni guests will cheer on
their own State College All-Stars as
they clash with the State Varsity.

Pep Rally Cancelled
Due To Small Turnout

Page Hall was the scene Wed-
nesday night of the first basketball
pep rally. The rally unofficially
marked the opening of the 1946-17
cage season at State, as the stu-
dent body had lts first glimpse of
the Varsity Squad.

An informal scrimmage between
the first and second Varsity teams
provided the small gathering with
its first cage thrills of the season.
The play was fast and the two
teams evenly matched as the squad
went through its practice scrim-
mage. However, because of the
small number in attendance the pep
rally ended with the scrimmage.
The scheduled cheering practice
had to be postponed.

That the pep rally was far from
a success is no secret. There were
