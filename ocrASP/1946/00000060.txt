Statesmen Weekend To lnclUde
Winter Semi-Formal, Date Party

 

Jones Points Virgin lslancls
ln teller To Stale College

How would you like to spend
a year away from the telephone,
radio and the world news? Right
now it probably sounds pretty
good. From Dr. Louis C. Jones,
assistant professor of English at
State College, comes a letter de-
scribing his impressions of the
Virgin Islands. where he is doing
just that.

In his letter Dr. Jones speaks
of the tropical atmosphere, of
strange plants, tropical fish,
clear and sunny skies, a climate
in which he goes swimming every
day, and above all where “time
doesn’t matter." (All good State
College students go to the Virgin
Islands when they die.)

The letter may be found on
page 3.
