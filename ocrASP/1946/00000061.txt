Bombs Away . . .

Target for this week is the assembly program bttt
before we open fire, a preliminary briefing on the
nature of the beast might be in order.

Assemblies are not required by state regulations,
nor imposed on the student body by the arbitrary
decision of the administration. Nor are they one
hour a week when Student Council is responsi-
ble for our entertainment. They are supposed to be
an opportunity for the students to meet for the pur-
pose of carrying on the student government, but the
one meager business meeting conducted since school
started in September seems a rather sad commen-
tary on student participation in that sphere.

State has a far-reaching reputation for rttnniug
its government and extracurricular activities with
a maximum of student initiative and a minimum
of faculty supervision, bttt magicians and fill-in
movies are a poor substitute for active leadership
at the one time the student body is convened.
There is a predominant feeling around State Col-
lege that there should be more business meetings.

Now to set our sights for the non-business assem-
bly. In other years, outside speakers have been
brought in to discuss current vital topics affecting
students both as citizens and as teachers. This
year, an increased percentage of State’s population
was entitled to vote in the state elections because
of the return of the veterans, but representatives
from each party were not obtained to speak, as they
have been in the past.

N0 recognition has been made of the struggle of
New York State teachers for higher salaries, either,
although it is being carried on five blocks away. if
some participant in this movement could be found
to inform us what is being done and what we could
do to help, it wouldn’t be an hour misspcnt.

Before we creep back into our camouflage, we
will discharge our remaining ammunition. Who
has charge of enforcing the ruling that no announce—
ments shall be tnade in assembly which are included
in the News? and would whoever made the regu-
lation that every publicity committee for every
organization stand on its head and serenade the
students with “tomorrow night in Page, tra in",
please repeal it?

"Peace On Earth . . . N

This year the simple words, “Peace on earth,
good will towards men," express not only the
essence of the Christmas season, but the crying
need of the World today. That State accepts this
challenge for constructive action, the colorful boxes
lining the corridors are proof positiv '.

At a time when the warmth of the family group
means tnost, Myskania with the help of the stu-
dent body is adopting the youngsters out at the
Albany Home, and making it possible for them to
wait up for Santa Claus with the same breathless
eagerness as other children. incidentally, Santa is
keeping his shop open to contributions until 4:30
today, and in case that surprise exam kept you
busy right up till now, it's only a short trip over to
the five and ditne on Central.

Another part of State heading towards the (‘lu'ist-
nuts ideal is the religious organizations. l‘ooling
their resources, SCA, iiillcl. and Newman have
been working together to make sure that Wednes-
day night is worth reserving for a joyous (‘lu‘istnttts
sendoff vacationwards.

 

STATE COLLEGE NEWS. FRIDAY. DECEMBER 13. 1946

 

Study In em

 

'A large group of State College
theatre goers. composed in the main
of freshman “daughters” and their
new sorority "mothers", arrived at
Page Hall on Tuesday last in high
spirits. After enjoying an evening of
good theatre fun, both farcical and
serious, there was every reason that
they should leave in the same state
of mind.

One element which contributed to
the success of the evening was the
interesting contrast between the two
productions, or rather, between their
two authors. The target for the
night was marriage. The bombard-
ier in the opening piece was the Rus-
sian heavy demolition expert, An-
ton Chekhov, whose lusty strike at
the vagaries of man to woman rela-
tionships brought forth many a
broad guffaw from an appreciative
audience. The afterpiece,, one of the
most effective jobs of the superbly
clever pinpoint bombing technician
GBS, approached the objective from
a more serious angle but provoked
frequent chuckles in the bargain.

The first play was, for the most
part, accurately and imaginatively
interpreted by Miss Dunker and her
cast, who must be complimented for
their sensible treatment of quasi-
burlesque comedy. The acting hon-
ors were Barselou’s by a nose. Es-
pecially commendable was his abil-
ity to control the audience for some
four minutes virtually unaided.

Gestures and voice inflections were
well handled, save for some spots
where clarity was sacrificed for speed
in delivery of lines.

We felt that Miss Dell, impeded by

By HAL ASHWORTH

————-

the sluggishness of her ageless and
arthritic man-servant, had difficul-
ty in getting started. As the action
orescendoed. hOWever. so did Miss
Dell. Aided by an expresive face,
Miss Dell succeeded in spots in being
hilariously funny. Her servant com-
pletely overlooked the comedy in his
character, nor do we think he had
definitely decided how to use his
voice.

Miss Fillman’s production included
just enough of the mysterious to en-
able us to scan Shaw’s argument.
The action was held together by the
completely natural and amiable in-
trepretation of the understanding
wife by Miss Jaffer. We gained con-
fidence that matters would resolve
themselves logically from our im-
pression that Miss Jaffre was entire-
ly at home on the stage. Her hus-
band obviously had more on his
mind. Mr. Reich's characterization
was convincing, if not consistently
clear. In attempting a difficult role,
that of the amorous poet, Giff
Wingate occasionally came close to
the overly-sincere. Shaw’s subtle
comedy was projected well by the
entire cast.

An additional word of encourage-
ment is given to those responsible
for the two effective sets. The de-
tail in Miss Dunker's set was ob-
viously well-planned. At the same
time mention should be made of the
unfortunate lighting situation in
Miss Fillman's play. Moving spot-
lights and the fact that shadows
were often cast against the French
doors. as well as across the faces of
the actors, proved quite distracting.

3. We resolve to criticize any-

number of people.

-i. We resolve to do our lessons

of equipment for a lady's handbag and, if your girl

STATE COIaLEGE NEWS, FRIDAY. DECEMBER 13. ‘1946 _

 

Newman, Hillel, SCA—To Present, 

Holiday Package
To Be Delivered
Next Wednesday

Entertainment and the creation
of seasonal spirits is a promise of
the “Holiday Package”. SCA, Hillel.
and Newman Club invite you to
come to the Page Hall Auditorium
Wednesday night at 8:30 P. M. to
watch one of their biggest and best
Big-8's.

The processions] by the 99 girls
in the State College Chorus will start
the performance. They will wear
dark robes and carry candles, such
as found in church on Christmas
Eve. Along an even more serious and
religious nature will be the two
scenes. “Tableau of Nativity" and
“Feast of Lights” presented by New
man Club and Hillel respectively.
The “Feast of Lights" is a study
in light and darkness, and the dra-
matic significance of the story will
be completely worked out with lights.

Well-known carols sung by the
chorus will provide the entertain-
ment during the intermission. A
little lighter vein will be injected
into the program when SCA depicts
a visit to a toy shop by Santa Claus.
As the curtain falls on this last
scene, the chorus will participate in
the Recessions]. The evening will
finish in the Gym where music will
be provided for all students who wish
to dance.

The “Twenty-third Psalm” op. 132
by Schubert and “The Slumber of
the Infant Jesus" by Francis Au-
guste Gevaert have been selected
by the Religious Clubs as the music
to accompany the occasion.

Tickets for the third Big-8 per-
formance of the year will be on sale
at the stamp booth next week for
fifty cents.

where to begin. Perhaps in the
plane that morning in early .iuiy

San Juan, Pit. and started the
last lap of our journey. Below its
we could see thousands of green
dots in the water, which arc the
Virgin islands, then the swelling
hills of St. Thomas with Churlotto
Amalie snuggled in their arms, thou
the forty miles over still blue occnn
nnd the rising mountains on the
north coast. of St. Croix.

The fields below were brown and
dry, the white ruins of dcscrtcd
plantations reflecting hot and arid
in the morning sun. “'l‘itnc doesn't.

friendly to the strangers; they have
the ways of an independent peo-
pic. The women walk with a gliding
ercctness. great bundles or pails
of water on their heads; the men
stride down the road swinging a
matchet, or gnllopping on their
little tnulcs. ’l‘heir politeness is in-
stinctive, bttt it never grovcls; tho
politeness of self respect.

And the town that looked so dusty
and drnb thut July morning is filled
with friendly streets now. the houses
