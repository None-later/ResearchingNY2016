O'Brien And Ferin
High Scorers For State

Displaying consistent scori‘rg
punch and a tight defense the State
Varsity opened their 1946-47 cam-
paign by drubbing the Alumni All-
Stars Saturday night. 68-29. In the
prelirning, State’s Junior Varsity
bowed to a fast Lippman’s Pharmacy
team 47-74.

sparked by the sharp shooting of
“Tom” O’Brien and “Cy” Fersh, the
Purple and Gold jumped off to an
early lead and stayed out in front
all the way. O’Brien collect seven
field goals and one foul while Fersh
was dropping in six field goals to
lead the attack. After a slow start
against their taller opponents the
Statesman began to find the range
and soon put the game on ice.

Kirby Leads Off

‘Play was not two minutes old be-
fore Jack Kirby retrieved a missed
foul shot and started State on its
scoring spree. O’Brien and Ken
George followed with push shots be-
fore Paul Merritt scored the Star’s
first with a foul shot. Ed Reed and
Vern Lehman tucked away goals to
end the first quarter scoring with
State ahead 9-5.

“Link” Marzello opened the second
period scoring with a beautiful over-
head shot from the deep left comer.
“Bolo” Marsland set from the cor-
ner and followed with a lay-up be-
fore Reed and Merritt tallied for the
Alumni. Taking a pass from Mars-
land, Fersh dropped in a one-hander
from the foul line and followed with
a lay-up. Half-time: State 29. Stars
10.

Frament Thrills Crowd

The Stars caught fire for the fires

few minutes of the third quarter
with Lehman. Lynch and Dickson
dropping in field goals. Taking a
pass from Amyot, Frament pivoted
and flicked in a sensational one-
handed. back-to-basket goal. State
then took over with Walt Schick
and “Karp” Karpiak tossing in
goals before Ken George found the
range for two scores.

Drugglsts Over Jayvees

Playing their first game of the
season, State's Jayvees were out-
classed 47-74 by a veteran Lippman
team paced by Joe Enos who tallied
fourteen field goals and two fouls.

Although handicapped by lack of
height, the Jayvees fought the Drug-
gists right down to the wire. Tom
Lisker and Al Beninati divided scor-
ing honors, each scoring six field
goals with Llsker also chipping in
with three foul shots.

By FRANK WOODWOR'I‘II

Here we go again after a two
weeks’ vacation without remunera-
tion It looks as though the IM bas-
ketball schedule will finally get un—
derway by the end of this week. It
has been decided that the teams will
be organized into two leagues.
League “A” will be composed of class
teams mainly. while league “B” will
be represented by fraternity teams.

There have been conflicting phil-
osophies as to the manner in which
the teams should be formed, and
this system that has evolved seems
to be the best possible solution to
the problem. It allows both for the
fellows who don’t have a team to
play with and for those fellows who
wish to play with their frat teams.

,At the risk of eating our own
words iwith carbon copies), we
would like to venture an opinion as
to the relative strength of the two
leagues. It is our opinion that the
Frat league will produce better bas-
ketball because the follows are ac-
customed to playing together. Don‘t
get us wrong; we are not assuming
that the frat league will produce
the champs. because the other league
will become better coordinated as
the season moves along. However.
the frat league should produce bet-
ter games in the earlier part of the
season.

A lot has been said already this
season about the matter of support-
ing our Varsity team this your. and
a lot more needs to be said. The pep
rally the other night showed the
lukewarm interest that prevails in
the college. If you want to keep a
team on the floor. especially a win-
ning team. you have to come out
and give them your active support—-
not your vcrbul support in the lowur
hull of Draper.

VAltSl'l‘Y SWIMMING?

There is it good chance that Stuic
will have u Varsity swimming team
this Winter if enough follow. are in~
tcrcstcd. Couch Hathaway has in—
formcd us that ii miulnuun of
twcnty follows will bc ncccssury. If
you are interested in swimming and
want to go out for this train. wc urge
you to sign the list that will be post-
cd on the MAA bulletin board.

Plattsburg, “Long John” Kirby will
serve as acring captain. The
Teachers of Plattsburg in their only
other game to date bowed to St.
Michael's by the aforementioned
score of (72-30). State‘s rivals of
northern New York always provide
stiff competition and the Purple
and Gold will be ready for a tough
game tomorrow evening.

Sierra Game At Armory

In a move to assure adequate
seating capacity for the large stu-
dent bodies of both Siena and State.
Mr. Hathaway has shifted State's
scheduled home game to the Wash-
ington Avenue Armory. The large
court will afford plenty of room on
which the two fives may cavort
without being hampered by a
crowd overflowing onto the court.
The first game betwoen State‘s
Junior Varsity and the Albany
Pharmacy Jayvees is called for 7:30.
State should be well represented in
the gallery since a hot rivalry is
fast developing between the two
colleges.

Varsity Pointing

The Purple and Gold are defin—
itely “up” for the long-awaited
clash with Sicnn. “Bolo” Marslond
will load an aggressive State team
that would iikc nothing better
than to dump the Indians. With
emphasis on [0111 shooting, Coach
Hathaway has been holding long
intensive drills this week in prepar-
ation for the big clash. Kcn George.

STATE COLLEGE NEWS. FRIDAY. DECEMBER 13. 1940

-M£n¢

 

By MARJORIE [IARLAND

Knit one, purl two, Skidmore has
its problems too. It seems that knit-
ting has become such a fad there
that assembly speakers are actually
concerned about it. The student
body continues merrily on. however,
knitting articles of handiwork to
send home along with that curse of
9. students llfe-their mid-semester
warnings.

Skidmore also has a. new addition.
a men’s basketball team. The ath-
letics are the veterans attending
Skidmore College Extension. They
were to open their season last week
with a game against Albany Phar-
macy.

Common Stock

Glancing through our NEWS files
the other day. I noticed the follow-
ing little anecdote. It seems a Long
Island potato married an Idaho po-
tato, and soon they had a little
sweet potato. The little one flour-
ished, and in due time announced to
its parents that it wanted to marry
Lowell Thomas. "But you can't
marry Lowell Thomas.” declared the
parents. "He‘s just a commentator."
Poly's Debut

One of State's rivals in basketball
this year made its debut in Madison
Square Garden December 3. The
team was that of Brooklyn Poly—
technic Institute in Its traditional
game with Pratt Institute. Although
your reporter has been unable to
find out the rcsulis of the contest
reports prior to the game pointed
to plenty of excitement.

The Senior class at Syracuse hold
its Senior ball last Friday night. and
it was a gala affair indeed with one
thousand couplcs attending. The ball
was strictly formal with music being
proviclcd by Randy Brooks and his
orchestra. The ihcmc was an Eye-
ning in Paris with the armory, the
scene of the dance, transformed into
a version of the famous Champs
Elysee. Trcs bicn. n‘csicc pas?
Army Surplus

Syracuse students were rather
amused lately to llOlI"C the large
proportion of G. l. clothing which
has reappeared on campus with the
appearance of cold weather. One of
tho chicf reasons for this is. of

that sorority silent period has fi-

So on behalf of all the Sorority

good to be back on speaking terms
with you all again.

Three State Vets Dislocated

Life was proceeding calmly
enough for Harold Ashworth
and Arthur Soderlind. Seniors,
and Jacob Schuhle, ’49. Com-
fortably settled in an apart-
ment at 151 Lancaster Street
they were free to pursue knowl-
edge without another care in
the world.

Into this idyllic existence a
short circuit made its merry
way. and undaunted by the ici-
est of obstacles, set fire to the
refrigerator. The use of the
apartment for a few weeks
Went up in a blaze along with
$.50 worth of bacon. a pound of
cheese and a few oranges. The
housing shortage became an
acutely personal matter.

Could an extra week of vaca-
tion be a possible solution to
this dilemma?

Not at all. Kind friends gave
refuge to the homeless until
such time as the insurance in-
vestigators could survey the
damage and make the apart—
ment livcable.

Will Distribute
Gifts At Home

Myskania will carry out a custom
initiated two years ago providing
Christmas entertainment for the
orphans of the Albany Home for

dren from 3 to 6 will hear stories
by Eleanor Binn. '47. and receive
their presents from Santa. The
second half of the evening is to be
devoted to the entertainment for
those children aged 7 to 17.

Two trios have been formed to
sing. the first composed of Eloise
Worth. Helen Kisiel, and Susan
Hildreth. Juniors. and the second
of Lois Bassett. Joan Keyton. and
Ann Morgan. freshmen. There will
be tap-dancing by Vivien Nielson.
Betty Brennan and Marilyn Skul-
sky. Seniors, and acrobatic dancing
by Margaret Hoefner, ‘49. and Shir-
ley Sheets. ’50.

son. '47. has been named chairman
