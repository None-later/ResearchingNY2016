tenders, the school teachers, some
of the clergy, and the plain folks
who do the ordinary unexciting jobs.

In this connection, certainly,, I
ought to mention our brilliant and
ext-emer able Governor. William
H. Hastie, former Dean of Howard
University Law School, and an out-
standing leader in our times. The
people of all colors and in all levels
of society admire him tremendous-
ly, and the effect upon morale must
be very great when every native
here knows that the chief executive
is one of their own race, and bids
fair to being their best governor.
Even the powerful little group of
white men who hold the largest
economic stake in the Island see
it that way now.

For us life is very quiet and very
busy. The book progresses and is
now about a,third done. The sun
and sea have tanned us all and we
eat like famishcd pigs. Christmas
morning, as we go into the sea for
our dip, it will not be the same as
other years, but then this is our
different your. A year without tele-
phone or radio or world news, it
year when eight hours of every day
is spend peeking at a typewriter,
rather like Archy the Cockroach.

in May I hope to see many of you
no I stop off in Albany before going
to my new duties at Cooperstown.
Untll than, a Merry Christmas and
a. healthy and happy New Your.
