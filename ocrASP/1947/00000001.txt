Christmas Party Succeeds,

Thanks To Well-Wishers

Think back, all you with that
“vacation’s-over” look, to the
second assembly before Christ-
mas and liberation, and you’ll
remember dropping your last
pieces of silver into the box pass-
ed among us for contributions
for the Christmas party given to
the kids at the Albany Home for
Children. Well, Myskania w“ould
like to let you all know what a
big success this affair turned out
to be, thanks to your own gen-
erosity, co-operation on the part
of many students, and also to a
bit of the Christmas spirit re-
vealed by Albany merchants con-
tacted for refreshments.

Special recognition goes to
'Paul Anast’s store, which con—
tributed fifty-four pounds of
candy absolutely free of charge,
and to Brook’s- Doughnut Store,
which donated one-half of all
the doughnuts purchased.

And in case you were wonder-
ing about the final resting place
of those odd nickels and dimes
that always turn up after such
affairs, the probable outcome,
says Myskania, will be their re-
turn to Smiles, the organization
responsible for such heart-
warming enterprises as- this one.

lege. a member of the New York
State Commission Against Racial
Discrimination, has been scheduled

Tradition! Relaxation! Corona—
tionl Such words can only begin to
describe the big Junior weekend

planned for February 6 and 7. Yes,
'40 is at it again. At what you say?
Well, it is like this.

Following in the footsteps of the
classes of 1047 and 1048, the present
Junior class h. combining its ambi-
tion and determination to carry on
the traditional Junior Weekend. We
said traditional in the first line be-
cause the entire Weekend is centered
around tradition. Certainly the
custom of a Weekend completely
taken over by the Juniors is as old
and respected a trmliiion as any at
State. State would not be college
without its Junior prom and ban-
quet

The weekend activities will be in-

itiated on Friday evening by the
semi~formal dance at the Auranla
Club. Larry Auilette and his orch-
estra will furnish not only the mu-
sic for dancing but also the accom—
paniment while State‘s own Fran
Mullin voculims. General chair-
man, Dale Wood, has promised that
the orchestra will play from f) p. m.
until 2 it. ill. with an hour for inter-
mission. All girls will have 8 o'clock
hours.

Just a minute! That is not uiil
The evening will reach its climax
as the Prom Queen enters 'mid the
strains oi' "Pump and Circumstance."
Rita Coleman, occupant of last
year’s throne, will return to crown
this year's regent. chosen as the
iiiOst beautiful girl in the Junior
class. Tickets for the dance, priced

at $2.40 a couple, will be on sale
in the Commons Tuesday through
Friday, February 3 to 6.

Plans are tentative as yet for the
informal gathering Saturday after-
noon, but Saturday night will be
devoted to the traditional Junior
banquet. Elizabeth Aim Gibson,
Chairman of the banquet, has stat-
cd that as yet the place has not
been chosen. but announcement
will be made when a decision is
reached.

The "Red Dcviis" seem to be de—
termincd to start the second scin-
csier off in the right frame of mind.
The sophistocated beauty of the
prom combined with the friendly
atmosphere of the banquet should
result in a bung-up weekend long
to be remembered by all who share
in its fun and good times.

The final steps in the interior
decoration of the Commons are un-
derway. Campus Commission has
obtained gray and maroon material

Council.

ing that the Commons was com-
pletely painted. Besides a com-
plete paint job on the walls and

18 Seniors To Practice !
ln Six Area Schools

During Second Semester

A new plan for cadet teaching in
area schools will be introduced into
the English department next sem-
ester. Beginning in February, nine
English majors from the Senior
class will go as practice teachers
into the Watervliet, Bethlehem Cen-
tral, Roesselville, Voorheesvllle, Ra-
vena, and Coeyman's high schools.
They will teach for eight weeks.

The plan will probably be expand-
ed to include at least three other
departments next fall, according to
Dr. Robert Frederick, Director of
Training, and a member of the
planning and adjustment commit-
tee. other members of the com-
mittee are Dr. Watt Stewart. tPro-
fessor of History, and Dr. Harry
Hastings, Professor of English.

Cadet teachers will act as assist-
ants to a master teacher, a regular
teacher at the high school. They
will carry a full day’s schedule and
responsibilities. After the eight
weeks, the nine cadets will be re-
placed by other practice teachers.

To Receive Eight Hours Credit

Eight hours of credit are given
for the eight weeks. Special courses
and adjustments will be made in
the English and Social Studies de-
partments for those who will miss
school time. All departments are
cooperating. .

Mary Elizabeth Conklin, Instruc-
tor and Supervisor in English, will
act as field supervisor of the six
area schools, which have promised
fullest cooperation.

The tentative list of Seniors and
the schools at which they will teach
follows:

First eight weeks: Eugenia Bara-
nowskl, Roesselvllle; Eloise Worth,
Roesselville; Ruth Bessel. Voorhees-
ville; Dorothy Diffin. Bethlehem
Central; Mary Fleming, Bethlehem
Central; Bette Jayne Jones, Water-
vliet; Gloria Gilbert, Watervliet;
Marjorie Lotz, Ravena; Jane Mc-
Guinness, Coeymans.

Second eight weeks: Muriel
W o o d s, Roesselville; Madelyn
Breich, Roesselville; Wanda Toma-
sik, Voorheesville; Shirley Webb,
Bethlehem Central; Mary Quinn,
Bethlehem Central; Hazel Engdahl,
Watervliet; Barbara Druschel, Wat-
ervliet; Carol Clark, Ravena; Mary
immett, Coeymans.

To Supplement Milne Program

The purpose of the program is
to supplement Milne practice teach-
ing by giving more practical experi-
ence, and to promote closer rela-
tions between State College and
the high schools of the state.

The present set up represents the
results of many years planning, but
is entirely experimental. explains
Dr Frederick. Although the pro-
gram will continue noxt year, it is
subject to many changes. Dr.
Frederick states, "The class of 1948
is witnessing a very significant de-
velopment in the history of the
college, one for which We have long
been planning. The class of ’48 can
be proud of the fact that it is the
class which inaugurated cadet
titiaghing in the high schools of the
s a e."
