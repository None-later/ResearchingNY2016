More Cooperation . . .

Committees are not formed to be imoredl
Yet, the general attitude around State seems
tocbe that committees were formed to be heckled
and those on the committees are malicious characters
attempting to embezzle money from the surplus.

This year, two issues in particular have de-
manded committee work and when both commit-
tees presented their final reports to assembly after
months of hard work and investigation, other
plans, directly opposing theirs, were offered from
the floor. We are-not trying to stifle free discus-
sion. Healthy discussions are the growth vitamins
of any organization but too many vitamins can
be dangerous.

If people have definite plans on the issues at
hand. why can’t they present them to the com-
mittee during the months they are working on
the problem? Why is it always so necessary to
wait until the committee appears before assembly
to drop these little bombshells?

The names of the members of these committees
are all announced in assembly and it would be an
easy matter to contact them. In case we should
forget the names, we do have a president for our
Student Association and she does keep a record
of such things. All ideas and suggestions are more
than welcome to these committees, but when ideas
aren’t expressed until the committee has finally
reported the results of their labors, they only serve
to antagonize and to postpone any action on the
problem in question.

The insurance question and the work on the
remodeling of the Commons brought the issue to a
head. Plans presented in assembly when these
questions were brought up only resulted in a post-
ponement of any definite action. Issues should be
discussed during the meetings but not to the point
where a whole new plan if suddenly thrown into the
laps of the student body and activities must cease
to discuss the new plan.

Much time and many rises in blood pressure
would be saved if such plans were presented to the
committees beforehand so they may investigate the
possibilities then. Committee members aren’t long-
haired orgies ready to spit in the eye of the first one
to venture a suggestion. Committees are formed
merely to organize work on a certain question. Any
student may offer plans.

In the future, what do you say we try to be a
little more considerate and instead of slamming a
committee’s work 'and offering a brand new plan,
consult the committee first. The committees formed
in Student Association work hard and sometimes
under handicaps. They deserve all the coopera-
tion we can give them.

Editor’s Note:

Many requests have been made
for some explanation of the theory
behind the preferential voting sys-
tem. We believe that student dis-
satisfaction with this system ec-
ists because of the lack of under-
standing of its fundamental prin-
ciples. In an attempt to clear up
misuderstanding, we are printing
the following explanation.

The preferential system We use
is essentially very simple, in spite
of what you may have heard. In an
election for a. single office, like class
president, it is designed to enable
the class to vote on as many can-
didates as it may want to, and still
to put into ofice the one who act-
ually has the support of the class.

Whenever more than two people
are nominated for one office, it is
quite possible for no one candidate
to get a majority right away, i. c.
more than half of the votes. That is
what usually happens here. Of
course, we could declare the person
with a. plurality elected, i. e. the
largest number of votes; but that
would hardly be a. democratic meth-
od. For example, in the recent Fresh-
man election, the largest number of
votes obtained right away by any
candidate for Secretary was 47 votes
out of 266.

Some way must be found which
gives a clear-cut majority to one of
the candidates. One method which
is commonly used, and was used
here once, provides for a. run-off
election between the two candidates
getting the highest number of votes.
In the run~off one of the two must
get a majority. That is quite true,
but there is a serious fallacy in this
line of argument. The fallacy lies
in assuming that one of the top two
will always get the support of a ma-
jority before any of the other candi-
dates who have been eliminated in
the run—off. The example I have
cited before—the Freshman elec-
tion for Secretary—shows the utter
foolishness of this assumption.
such a run-off had been held among
the top three or the top four, it
would have been mathematically
possible for either the third or
fourth candidate to receive a ma-
jority of the vote. Starting with the
run-offs at the top is therefore not
a sound method.

Start At Bottom -

If the solution does not lie in start-
ing the run-offs at the top, it ob-
viously lies in starting at; the bot—
tom; that is, in having a run-off
among all but the lowest candidate,
and in continuing to eliminate the
lowest candidates one by one in each
successive runoff. This can be done
very easily by marking just one bal-
lot preferentially and taking care of
the run-offs in the count.

H
H

How and why is this done? If you
have voted for one out of a number
of candidates, you will naturally
vote for him again each time ills
name appears on the run-off ballot;
all the more so since there are fewol'
and fewor other candidates compet~
ing for your vote. Only when the
person you have voted for is clim-
inate do you have to switch your
support to one of the other candi-
dates. You do this by indicating
a second choice on your original
ballot. Thus, as long as your first
choice is still running your vote
counts for him on each run-off,
called a distribution. When he is
eliminated because he has the small-
est number of votes, then you trans-
fer your votc to the one of the re-
maining candidates whom you fa-
vor. Should he, in turn, be elimin-
ated, your next choice is considered,
and so on. All this is done step by
step, or run-off by run-off, by those
who count the ballots. This idea is
called "the single transferable bal-
lot". That is the pl'ei’crential'll
term for a series of run-offs which
starts with all the candidates, con-
tinues by eliminating the lowest can-
didates one by one and transferring
their ballots to the next choice mark-
ed on those ballots, and stops as
soon as one of the candidates either
has n lnaority or is the only one
left. In each run-«off, or distribu-
tion, your vote is counted for that.
one of the candidates whom you pre-
fer to the others still running.

In this manner the preferential
system determines with complete
accuracy and without the slightest
opportunity for flnagllng which one
of the candidates can most readily

V,Wa.io~um

get the support of the majority of
the voters. . ,
Explain Multiple Elections

We now come to elections like
those for Student Council in which
more than one office must be filled
from one list of candidates. In this

case. the voting system used dependi'

entirely on the general objective of
the election. The present voting
system was set up with this objec-
tive—to provide for representation
of all sections of class opinion in
proportion to the strength of those
sections within the class. By this
way it is hoped that a Student
Council truly representative of the
four classes can be obtained. If you
agree with the objective, the pres-
ent voting system follows easily.

When several people are to be
elected, they obviously cannot all
get a majority of the votes. There-
fore, a number of votes must be
found which four and only four of
the candidates can get. This num-
ber is called a quote. For one office
it is one more than half the votes;
for two, one more than a. third; for
three, one more than a fourth; for
four, one more than a fifth; or, the
number of votes divided by one
more than the number of offices to
be filled plus one. When 300 vote
for 4 class representatives the quota
is therefore 61. Notice 4 times 61
equals 244; the last candidate de-
feated can get only 56 votes. If you
lower the quote. to 60, five candidates
can be elected.

Once a. quota has been set, the
ballots are counted in essentially the
same way as for one office. The low-
est candldates are eliminated one
by one until four candidates have
the quote. or only four are left. Since
the sum of the quotas is 244, almost
everyone in the class contributes to
the election of a Council member.
Furthermore, half of the class elects
half the representatives, one quar-
ter elects one quarter and smaller
groups have their scattered votes
concentrated on one candidate in
the run-offs. This is the idea called
proportional representation or P.R.
Distribution of Surplus

The only real complication lies in
the question of what is called a.
surplus. It might happen that some—
one gets more than 61 votes or what-
ever the quota happens to be. For
example, in last year's election for
Student Council, the Class of '49
gave 133 out of 256 first choices to
one candidate. This excess over the
quota, called a surplus, must be
distributed somehow if the other
candidates are to be able to get a
quota also, and if large numbers of
ballots are not to be wasted. Form-
el'ly, we distributed the surplus by
taking the exceSs ballots off the
top of the candidate‘s pile and re-
distributing thcm according to the
next. choice marked on those ballots.
This method is evidently not much
good.

Quite aside of the temptation to
help your friends by taking the
“right.” ballots, it. is absolutely im—
possible to select ballots completely
representative of the candidate's
whole pile. It is therefore necessary
to redistribute all the ballots but at.
a lower value. ’l‘hus. under the pres-
out system, if your vote is marked
for 11 candidate who needs only
9/10th of the votes he receives, you
will give him il/lotlls of your ballot
and the other l/lOth to your second
choice. Ill this way the element of
chance, introduced by the selection
of only some of the ballots for count.-
illg, illld formerly decisive ill about.
half of our elections, is eliminated.
At all times, your ballot is fully
counted.

Elimination of Candidates

In the multiple election, there-
fore, your balllot goes to your first
choice as long as he is running and
to the extent. that. he needs it. If
he is eliminated, your ballot goes
to your second choice; if he times not
need all of your ballot, he gets what
he needs and the rest. goes to your
second choice. The same proocduro
is used if 11 candidate gets it sul'pllis
after one of the other candidates
been cllllllllilttid in n run-off.
Splits in Surplus Distribution

When ballots are split ill a surplus
distribution very cumbersome fruc—
t.iotls may be produced. For example,
ill last. year's election for Mysknllin,
one candidate had a surplus of 30
votes out of 163. That would mean
splitting each of those 103 votes into
two parts—mm of 133/163 for the

Since this is the first issue of the New Year, it is
customary to list our own resolutions and make a
much longer list of resolutions which other people
should keep. It is always good to haVe a certain
time to stop, look briefly back, and take a few min-
utes to reflect on accomplishments and failures, the
happy and the unhappy moments, with a view toward
improvement. However, we have never believed in
hard and fast resolutions, but merely think it is bet-
ter to do what is believed to be right as seen at the
time, with no apologies. We quote the translation of
the proverb We learned this Week in German class:
“The road to Hell is paved with good resolutions."
Since no one would pay any attention to the resolu—
tions anyhow, space may as well be conserved.

New Practice Teaching Set-up

We’ve heard both pro and con criticism of the new
full time teaching deal. While it will undoubtedly
prove invaluable to the student, the complaint has
arisen that it will, from a practical viewpoint, cause
quite some inconvenience and monetary outlay for
the people concerned. Carfare adds up, and seniors
who hold student offices will be seriously handicapped
in the performance of their duties. Maybe these com-
plaints can be straightened out when the plan begins
operation.

A Freshman Speaks

Since sometimes a newcomer will see many things
an older resident has become so accustomed that he
is blind to them, we have asked a freshmen to give
his impressions of State College. It follows:
State College—My Diary

Sept.—F1'Osh Camp—what a swell way to get ac-
quaintedi But too many Long Islanders; still had lots
of fun. on those beanies but we’re proud of them and
what’s that Myskania? Who do they think they are,
but I guess they can’t help it. Well the college seems
good but it hasn’t any football team and where's the
campus? Most of my teachers seem okay but oh that
pre-med course from Dorwaldt.

Oct. Gee, the longer I’m here, the better I like
it. The Commons, Lounge, the Bull. Glad to see that
CampUS Day had a. queen worthy of the title. Don’t
miss the big—time football anymore. Rather spend
Saturdays in the library anyhowll How come the
upperclass girls are so nice to the frosh girls? Al-
ways taking them to lunch at the Bowl.

Nov. Just think~only a few weeks to Thanksgiving
and home. No book work then. Found out what St.
Mary‘s is. I do feel sorry for the boys 11p there cause
girls aren’t allowed in. That rushing gets me, espec—
ially some of those rules. I overheard one of them
say, “Sorry, I can't; speak to my roommate—she’s sor-
ority." Oh those elections. Dunn has just started——
the truth is we are going to back our officers until
the green gremlins finally whl rivalry. Vacation is
getting closer and term papers are assigned too. It’s
here—11nd gone.

Dee. Heard Mumbles Thornhiii is coming to State.
Stan Abrams says so. Basketball team is okay. Plan to
see rest. of the home games. College work is hard
but social life is more than enough to make up for it.

Jan. Hit tune of the week. “Serenade of the Bells"
bells to classes. Vacation was so good, but what is
the gleam coming out of the Commons? What is
that new look? I guess the girls want to carry around
more weight. Alld what. is that white stuff on the
,ground? (Ed’s Note. There was a. heavy frost ill New
York and Long Island according to 0111' friends from
the North country.)

I guess I’ll close now cause I‘ve got to finish that
term paper.

Jr. Prom Corning

Although it hasn’t. been advertised lunch, the next
big dance here will be the Junior Prom, on Friday.
February 6» just four weeks from tonight. Most. of us
will be over the effects of Claude Thornhill by then
and can enjoy the music of Larry Audeile nlld his or-
chestra from Schenectady. featuring our own Frau
Mulliu as vocalist. (let. your dates early!

’48 is file year

Our own private poll on the question. “When tilc
old your passed out?" iillli established the fact that
the average State College student celebrated snllcly.
but managed to stay out to 5110. the first sun of 1040
Mac. Happy New Year.
