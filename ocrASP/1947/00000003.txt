Roguish Resolutions Rois'e'fCoinf‘f' n e

Revealing ' Resolvers Do Some

New Year’s came again this year,
and as usual brought resolutions
with it. However, either the people
at State are too bashful to admit
that they have made and broken
many already, or else they were
just too wise to make them in the
first place. As a result, the follow-
ing represent the work of only a
few students.

In keeping with the spirit of the
season, exam season, that is, Gloria
Sottile, ’50, expressed the sentiments
of many when she said, “I’m going
to classes every day now so that I
can use mycuts during exam week.”
Along the same line, Rhoda Riber,
’50, remarked that she wasn’t going
to cause the librarians any more
trouble—she plans to spend all her
free time in the Commons. Not to
be out-done, Helma Rosenberg. '50,
quoted Benjamin Franklin, when she
said, “Don’t let studies interfere
with your college education."

0n general campus issues, Renee
Harris, ’50, was overheard telling a
friend that she planned to buy a
pair of rose-colored sun-glasses es-
pecially for the Commons. Sara-
Caruso, '50, said that she intended
to make the most of Leap Year. Her
motto is to “Grab a mate at State
in '48."

From the male element the reso-
lutions were varied. Robert Freyer,
'50, has decided never to stir his
coffee with his left hand—he re-
ceived a spoon for Xmas. Earle
Jones, ’50, has announced that he
won't be walking in the rain bare-
foot because he might grow. Har-
vey Milk, ’51, has promised not to
look at the “New Look."

In the opinion of many the fol-
lowing are a few of the resolutions
that should have been made. but
weren't:

i. The president of Signum Lau-
dis will not make Dean’s List.

2. Assembly attendance will not
be compulsory.

3. State will become nationally
famous.

4. Our new president will be tall,
dark, handsome, and Stately.

5. Sororities and frats will not
"rush" through their first semester.

6. We will have formals every
weekend with a different “name
band" at each for those who can't
make the holiday mm.

7. Exams will be scheduled only
for those who want them and at
the stooge's own convenience.

6. The library will be made into
a swimming pool, so that more peo-
ple will see the inside of Hawley
Hall.

9. The buildings will be made
smoke-proof and students will learn
to inhale so that cigarettes will be
seen in lowar Draper and the PD.
once more.

lVCF Sponsors
Food-Clothing

European Drive

A used clothing drive for European
students is now being conducted by
Inter-Varsity Christian Fellowship
under the supervision of Robert Pet-
ers, ’49. IVCF is also sponsoring the
CARE drive for cash contributions
for food to be sent to European
countries.

Contributions for the clothing
drive must consist of clean, usable
clothing of any size; it should be
placed in the box located in the lower
hall of Draper. Money for CARE
may be given to any IVCF member.

The weight of all clothing con-
tributed will be doubled by the War
Relief Commission, national promo-
ters of the program, before being
sent out of the United States.

Editor's Notes. . ' ' - I
The editorial referred to be
appeared in a December issue of
the Evangelist, the Catholic news-
paper for the Diocese of Albany.
Students wishing to read this edi-
torial may do so on the P0. Bulle-

tin board.

According to an editorial in the
Evangelist of December 5, 1947, the
State Department of Education and
our parents have “cause for alarm".
We are being exposed to "crass ma-
terialism” and “sniping at religious
beliefs" here at State. Furthermore,
we may now find a “left-wing
strain" in our sociology classes.

The first of these charges
the editorial does not attempt to
support by any evidence whatsoever.
The second charge is derived from
the fact that our Professor of Socio-
logy, Doctor Theodore Standing, is
acting chairman of the Albany
Chapter of the Progressive Citizens
of America. This, according to the
editorial, gets him “the accolade of
praise" from Moscow through Henry
Wallace as intermediary. Since, ac-
cording to the editorial, the "PCA
is anything but 100% American in
its convictions and purposes", there
should now be fear of “the evident
danger of infiltration of radical
thought and foreign ideologies into
the American way of life”. Against
these dangers, the editorial con-
cludes, our educational system must
be safeguarded.

While I have myself attacked the
PGA in public meetings, including
one of State College students, there
are some things in this editorial with
which I cannot agree. Upon careful
examination my sociology notes re-
veal no dangerous “left-wing
strains". But suppose they did. Is
a restriction of academic freedom
likely to help us in arriving at solu-
tions to the complex problems of

 

’ Ao-‘A
N .m/
n -'.-d

modern societyi' Is not seem. oftional Catholic.Rural Life Confer-

expression, on and off‘the'campjis,
a prerequisite 'of real progress? Sure-
ly the editor of the Evangelist would
not demand or expect that a profes-
sing Catholic instructor at State
adapt the “strain” of his teaching
to ideological standards determined
by others.

What about the “danger of infil-
tration of radical thought and for-
eign ideologies"? It might be pointed
out that practically all "ideologies"
in the United States, from Catho-
licism to Keynesian economies, are
importations. Even the Statue of
Liberty comes .from overseas. The
growth of some foreign ideologies in
this country is due to their free ac-
ceptance by some of the people; the
lack of growth of other foreign
ideologies is due to their rejection.
This free process of acceptance and
rejection, together with native modi-
fication and growth, has produced
the ideological part of “the Ameri-
can way of life”. If that way of life
is to persist and grow, that process
of acceptance and rejection must be
allowed to continue freely. The idea
that academic freedom must be re-
stricted to what some one or some
group considers to be in the best
interests of society, with criticism
allowed only if it is completely with-
in the existing order ~- the idea
lauded by Stalin as intra-party
democracy — is one which we can
safely leave to the Russians.

The solution for today’s mass con-
fusion does not lie in mass hysteria.
In a discussion of communist se-
mantics on the same page of the
Evangelist, the Reverend James M.
Gillis says. “The Word most fre-
quently used by communists to con-
demn all who disagree with them
is “fascist”. Let us not follow this
path and call all with whom we dis-
agree, communists. or imply that
they are. We might profit more from
adopting the attitude evidenced in
the column by the Reverend
George G. Higgins adjoining the
editorial. “The Conference (Na-

ence), as His Eminence (Cardinal
Stritch) pointed out, behaves that
farmers ought to be organized into
their own economic associations, not
alone to advance their own economic
interests but to promote the general

economic welfare. This part of the
Conference’s program is unpopular,
of course. in certain influential quar-
ters and will be bitterly resisted.
But the Conference will not be de-
terred in the slightest by phony
charges of ‘communism', for it knows
only too well that among the best
friends the communists have in the
United States are those greedy in-
dividuals and corporations which are
concentrating land ownership in the
hands of the few."

Gerhard Weinberg, '48. We agree
with Mr. Weinberg's statement and
request its publication in the State
College NEWS.

Now that 48 has taken the place
of dear old 47 on the calenders it
looks like a good year, what with
the presidential election, Leap year
and a winning basketball team.

The Varsity has gotten off to a
promising start in this ’47-'48 sea-
son. The team has already won
more games in the 4 Weeks of play
than it won in the entire ’46-’47
season. Counting the Alumni open-
er the squad w0n 3 out of 17 games
last season and have already topped
4 out of 5 opponents this year. From
all indications the remainder of the
season should follow its opening

 

 

 

 

pattern.

Probability is high that there are
to be busses to take students to at
least one of the “away” games after
exams.

With the change in weather also
came a change in the WAA bulletin
board. Granted it looks like a work
of art but may we here and now
make a small criticism. We believe
a bulletin board is mainly for the
purpose of announcements and
items of general interest. If it loses
its functional purpose it should no
longer masquerade under the name
of “Bulletin” board.

As it stands now all announce-
ments are tacked about 2 inches
above the bottom and drape over
the baseboard. This is especially
poor if the paper happens to be a.
sign-up sheet. The signatures of
the students become so illegible that
even they can’t read them.

The appearance of the Board
would also be greatly improved if
the announcements posted were
more standard in character.

Outing Club is holding a meet-
ing at 7:30 Monday nite to make
plans for a ski trip to North Adams
on Saturday, January 17.

Jayvees Clash With
ABC Five Tonight

Pointing for their third win of
the season, State’s Junior Varsity
will meet Albany Business College at
the Albany Y.M.C.A. at 8 o’clock.
Tonight’s game will be the Jnyvee's
seventh of a nineteen game sched-
ule.

After bowing in their season
openers to Potter Club, and Lipp-
man’s Pharmacy, the Jayvces took
two from Skidmore. Next on the
cage card was the overtime loss to
Pharmacy by a 40-39 count. Mal
Falleck paced the Junior States-
men in this thriller, chipping in
with five field goals and a foul.

Traveling to Middlebury, the Jr.
Varsity pushed the Vermonters all
the way in losing 49-43. The Mid-
dics grabbed an early loud. but were
forced to play out the string with
their first team to keep ahead of
[he fnst-s:i.epping .iuyvccs. Jim Wor—
dcn, Paul Carter and Mal Fallcck
paced the Statesman.

With four long drills behind them
the Jiichos are set to give A.B.C.
a battle tonight. Coach “B010”
Marsland has been scrimmuging the
.lityvccs in long sessions in order
to have the Junior statesmen at
their best for tonight's oncminim'.
Davc Wothei'by, Bill Dunn with
Worden, F‘ailcck and Carter make
up the starting five.

Sayles, Phi Deli
Pace HOOp Tilis

On Tuesday and Wednesday even-
ings, January sixth and seventh,
Phi Delta defeated Beta Zeta, 12-7
and Kappa Delta, 18-6 to hold first
place with a record of 4 and 0.
Gamma Kappa Phi held on to sec-
ond place with a record of 3 and 0.

At the same time Sayles took pos-
session of the dorm league lead by
defeating North Hall, 24-4; and
Tommy More Hall, 34-5. This gives
the girls from Partridge Street a
record of 4 and 0. Pierce took Wren
Hall, 18-9, to retain second place.

Other games played this week in-
clude Newman's win over Tommy
More house, 17-5, and Chi Sigma
Theta’s defeat of A.E.Phi, 14-12, on
Tuesday and, on Wednesday night,
Wren‘s 18-13 defeat of Newman
Hall.

Both of Sayles’ games were free-
scoring affairs in which they had
the advantage over their opponents
from start to finish.

In the Phi Delta Beta Zeta game
the winners trailed 2-5 at the end
of the first quarter and 4-7 at the
half; however, they held the BZ for-
wards scoreless in the second half
and went on to win with Tilden
tossing in six points and Koch two.
The contest against KD was all in
Phi Delt's favor, with them leading
11—4, at the half.

The only “close” game of the week
occurred when Chi Sig guards held
Gamma Kap to a 5-4 score at the
half.

Novel Ski Club—Adds
To Winter Program

Plans for the creation of a ski-
ing club have been under discussion
between Coach Hathaway and en-
thusiastic sportsters. Beginners are
welcome, since a class for instruc-
tion in the art of skiing will be con-
ducted by Coach Hathaway.

As yet, hours for meetings have
not been set in order that they may
be arranged most advantageously to
the greatest number of these wish-
ing to participate. From all ap-
pearances, it is most likely that the
club will go into action Saturday
afternoons.

Classes will probably be held in
Washington Park. There is a pos-
sibility that trips to the Heidelbcrgs
might be arranged. Other possi—
bilities urc weekend juunts to Camp
Johnson or use of the municipal
golf course.

Personal possession of equipment

is not necessary since the WAA has ‘

four pairs of skis with harnesses
and poles accessible to those who
do not own such equipment. Those
desiring to purchase skis can take
advantage of the opportunities ul-
i‘ordcd by the WAA store for ob-
taining equipment at. wholesale
price.

Bow To Pharm;

Tie For Second

state's varsity kekgiers dropped
their match with the Albany Col-
lege of Pharmacy Wednesday, bow-
ing by a 2-1 count. The loss sent
State into a second place tie with
R.P.I. in the inter-collegiate lea-
gue. Siena retained its first place
position, and R.P.I. swept its match
to stay in the lead-challenging
position.

Pharmacy lead-of! the match by
evening’s opener. Houck’s 185
paced the Pharmacists in their
185 jaced the Pharmacists in their
opening win. Coming into the sec-
ond game, the statesmen began to
hit the alleys with more accuracy.
Marty Bortnick chipped in with a
208 game and Joe Carosella hit
the timber for 205. State‘s winning
margin was thirty-six pins. In the
third and ﬁnal game the Pharma-
cists rolled to a 775-722 win. Adsit
lead the Pharmacy five with 176,
while Diz Dickinson’s 187 was tap
