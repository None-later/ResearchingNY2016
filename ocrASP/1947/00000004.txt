sists of Joseph Roulier ’48, Chair—

Deli and Annalee Levine, Seniors,
and Peter and June Youmans, Jun-

elected candidate and one of 30/l63
for each second choice. To avoid
such complications, each bal-
lot is made equal ot 100 points. In
this case that meant that 81.33
points from each ballot were re-
tained by the elected candidate while
the voter could give 18 points to his
second choice. Since no ballot value
can be created, fractions of a sur-
plus point are always omitted. This
loss does not affect the election as
long as a small number of offices is
being filled. In tho Myskania cicc-
tion used as an example here. the
average loss per ballot was .001672.
Thus, you get proportional repre-
sentation correct. to all intents and
purposes, to two decimal places.
Texts Claim System Accurate

You may see from all this any the
system we have adopted Is referred
to by the texts on preferential vot-
ing as the best and most accurate
in existence. Remember. though.

that it does not guarantee intelligent
voting. That is your job. Your in-
telligent or unintelligent voting will
give you intelligent or unintelligent
results correct to two decimal places.

A final word to those who may be
running for office sometime. Often
in rccouit years candidates have
claimed that seine other candidate
had found a way to beat the sys-
tem. Don‘t worry. Under this sys-
tem, Ihci'o is no mysterious way of
marking or not marking one ballot
which makes it count more effec-
tively than any other ballot. Those
who believe they have found an
opening for finagiiiig are i'ooiing
neither you nor the system, but
themselves.

Mark your preferences carefully in
exactly the order in which you con-
sider the candidates. If that is what
you put into the ballot box, that is
what will come out.

Commuters Club
Brings Speaker
To Assembly

Mr. Leo R. Noonan, Representa-
tive Assemblyman from Cattaraugus
County, and a former superinten-
dent of schools, will be presented in
assembly this morning by Commut-
ers' Club to speak on the pending
legislation on teachers' pay which
is now before the Assembly. Vot-
ing will take place on the MAA
resolution concerning line trans-
fers which was discussed in the last
assembly before vacation. Next Fri-
day, January 17. a concert by the
chorus and orchestra under the
cirectlon of Dr. Charles Stakes, Pro-
fessor of Music. will be given in as-
sembly and a plaque is to be pre-
sented in memory of Donald White.
a former member of the Class of ’48.

Mr. Nocnan studied at Boston
College, Harvard and at Blackstone
Collage n” Law. lie has worked as
a newspaper reporter and later was
city editor of the Quinery Tele-
grai‘n. For eighteen years he was
principal of Farmersvillc High
School and at the present time is ii
member of the Assembly Committee
on Public Educatiin.

In addition to the concert in next
Week’s assembly. there will be the
presentation of a bronze plaque in
memory of Donald White, a former
member of the Junior class. who
died last summer. This plaque is
to be presented by Alice Williams,
President of the Class of '48, in be-
half of the class. Both the Junior
class and Myskania are responsible
for the instigation of plans for this
memorial. The money was taken
from the Student Association sur-
plus and the plaque is to be affixed
to the piano in Page Hall.

At a Student Council meeting
Eloise Worth. Alice Pi’indle, Juniors,
Jean Pulver. '49. and Geraldine
Cooperman. ‘50, were appointed to
take charge of State Fair.

A report was made by the com-
mittee that was appointed to see
about the possibilities of a new
mimeograph machine that a mach-
ine will be purchased as soon as
one is available.

In the last assembly before vaca-
tion, it was pointed out that when
the Men‘s Athletic Association sub-
mitted its budget last spring, many
of the items were very indefinite
since there had been no budget for
a period of several years on which
to base estimates. and that it has
been necessary to make several
changes thus far this year and that
more are anticipated. Because it is
often desirable to make line trans-
fers on short notice without waiting
for the weekly meeting of the Stu-
dent Board of Finance. a resolution
was made to amend the Consti-
