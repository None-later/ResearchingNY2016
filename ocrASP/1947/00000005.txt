Erehwyna . . .

A traveler from a far-off land was asked why he
had come to this country. “I come,” he answered,
“to bring news to your people of my country.”

And so it was that we first heard of Erehwyna—
for that was the name of this far-off land. And so
it was that we first learned of the Erehwynians and
of the ways in which they lived.

The government of this land of Erehwyna was
a democracy, for the people of that land were wise
and had had much experience with other forms of
rule—much to their regret. For their monarchy had
been too absolute, their communist state too reso-
lute, and their corporate state too dissolute. They
had found that the democratic way was, after all,
the most satisfactory, and it was a pleasure, this
traveler related, to see the citizens on the great-
est national holiday, Election Day, standing in
line to make use of their privilege of voting.

The traveler then spoke of the industrial revolu-
tion which the people of Erehwyna had just exper-
ienced—it had consisted of rechanneling all of the
labor and energy expended in the manufacture of
guns, battleships, poison gases, and tanks to the
construction of modern homes for all, hospitals.
schools and colleges. This industrial revolution had
been made possible because of the new extensive
use of atomic energy in industry, and it was now
possible for everyone to possess an autt‘nnobile, an
autogyro, and a combination toaster-and vacuum
cleaner.

“Tell us more of your land," the traveler was
asked. And so it was learned that in this land
each person was the equal of the other, both before
the law and in the eyes of his fellow citizens. This
was not so because every man was of the same
color or the same religion or the same nationality,
but rather because each person understood these
differences in their proper relationships, and did
not over-emphasize them in the conception of
man as an individual.

The coming of the Atomic Age to l‘Irchwyna had
brought with it the formation of the Atomic Labor
Unions——at first. an exclusive fraternity of only
those men and women employed in atomic indus-
tries; but as the number of atomic workcrs had
increased, so had the membership in the atomic
unions. The symbol of the tinioii was an Atomizcr.

Industrial trife was non-existent in this land,
for all disputes that arose wcrc amicably scttlcd
by representatives of labor and nuinagcmcnt and
the government working fogt'llli'l' to ari'ivc at a
peaceful settlement.

This traveler from a far~off land was askt-d thc
secret of this distant land where dcinocracy was
so effective and prosperity so universal. "Wt- liavc
no secret," answered the man. "At the licginning of
every New Ycar, cach citizen looks about him, dc-
cidcs what needs to bc changcd, and Ihcn makes a
resolution to take an active part in attempting to
improve the country."

“'l‘hcrc’s nothing backward about l'li‘chwyiin,”
we commented. A

“No, nothing,” said he, “cxccpt thc spclling."
And he left, (expressing thc thought that lllt' fitl--
vancemcnts his country had madc III/Ill, happcn
here . . . .

According to the latest, practic-
ally every college in the country
ended their pic-vacation slump with
balls, proms et cetera. or else are
starting their after vacation-slump
with balls, proms et cetera ,— and
many punctuated by the band of
Claude Thornhill (at Skidmore),
Shep Fields (at Brooklyn Polytech),
Duke Ellington (at Slena), Freddie
Slack (at Syracuse) . . . Give us an-
other beer.

Well, we didn’t get engaged over
vacation but we were busy pol-
ishing up on our bridge playing—
after the Inter-collegiate Bridge
Tournament. Since then we've found
out that there may be some tough
competition next year. “The Cam-
pus" published by the University of
Rochester illustrated some very
sharp bridge playing as demonstrat-
ed by four of their players and eight
kibitzers—to wit:

Dealer: Fleckenstein.

Shaugnessy
Spades 10, 9
Hearts 7, 6, 5, 4
Diamonds 10, 9, 8, 7
Clubs 10, 9

Hearts 10, 9, 8 Hearts A, K, Q, J
Diamonds void Diamonds A, K,
Clubs K, Q, J, Q, J

8, 5, 4, 2 Clubs A
Fleckenstein
Spades 8, 7, 6, 4, 2

Diamonds 6, 5, 4, 3, 2

Clubs 10

The Bidding:
Fleckenstein Flowerday
Pass 2 Diamonds
3 Clubs Pass
5 Clubs Pass
Double Pass
Shaugnessy Berthold
Pass Blows nose
4 Clubs Scratches ear
6 Clubs Pass

“Notice the tricky bidding in-
volved here. Flowerday opens with
his void suit just to throw Shang-
ncssy and Fleckenstein off guard.
Berthold answers Flowerday by
blowing his nose which shows that
he is catching a cold and therefore
may not be up to his usual fine per-
formance. Very quick to catch on,
Flowerday passes. At the last mo-
ment, Fleckenstcin doubles his own
partner's bid, showing that he is
stronger in clubs than he had really
let on. When the cards were played.
Berthold took every trick. The hand
ended with Fiowerday leaping at

Berthold’s throat, and Fleckentein
and Shaughnessy slashing at each
other with table legs.”

Probably many readers remember
Dr. Daniel W. Snader who was the
mathematics supervisor here last
year, and who is now the director
of mathematics at the University
of Illinois’ Undergraduate Division
at Galesbui'g. Dr. Snader is mak-
ing history, having recently written
three books, two on algebra, and
one on trigonometry for high school
and college. No doubt few readers
know that Dr. Snader turned down
a baseball contract with the St.
Louis Cardinals in order to concen-
trate on mathematics. He was also
widely known in Albany, having or-
ganized the Capitol District Mathe—
matics Association.

Gifts totaling many hundreds of
thousands of dollars have been re-
ceived by the Univerity of Texas
over the years, but, although they
are small, there is perhaps no more
regular contributor to the Univ-
sity than Herman Schmidt of Be-
zar County.

Every few months Schmidt makes
a contribution. His most recent gift
of $2 is, he indicated, to be used in
“experimental work with farm and
ranch products or other medical re-
search, just so long as it benefits,
materially, humanity."

Seine time ago the University
Board of regents accepted appre—
ciatively a $1.31 check from Schmidt
which the donor asked be used “for
development of new products."

Progressive Pratt

Pratt Institute has not only given
a 4-point protest against final ex-
ams, but also a 3-point program of
reform. Their main objection seems
to be that a test of crammed knowl—
edge often is 505'; of the final mark
in a course despite all. For a solu-
tion they prefer short interval quiz-
zes depending on the credit hours
given in the course. At this point,
we have gone progressive along with
Pratt.

And here‘s an idea from Massa-
chusetts State College which doesn't
seem too bad for those as would be
interested—a group of students have
formed a baby—sitters club. The
members answer calls for baby-sit-
ting from the faculty and nearby
communities. The organization rc—
eeives calls between four and five
PM. daily and anwcrs to the name
of John Setter.

In case you've forgotten. we print

Up to the end of l.lll' fiscal year

We urge all members of student
association to vote against this
amendment and offer our reasons:

In the first place, we pride our-
selves in running our various or—
ganizaiions, clubs, publications, etc.
with not only a minimum of faculty
control, but. in most cases with no

Students Choose
State University

For Debate Topic
Plan Meet With Drew

For Labor Discussion

The poll on topics for future de-
bates conducted December 20 in
assembly revealed that the ques-
tion on a state university was the
most popular. Debate Council will
invite Syracuse University to de-
bate here ln assembly either Febru-
ary 14 or 21 on this topic, “Re-
solved: That there be established in
New York State a state supported
university.”

The topic, “Resolved: That Greek
letter fraternities be abolished,”
ranked second in popularity. The
other topic suggested in the poll
was “Resolved: That Labor be giv-
en an active part in the manage-
ment of indusnry."

Drew University Debate

The latter topic will be used for
debate with Drew University, Feb-
ruary 28. Tryouts for this debate
will be held February 7 in Room
100 at 7:30 P. M.

Maiy Ellen Diener, ’47, President
of Debate Council, has announced
that Betty Rose Hilt, ’47, has been
appointed chairman for the annual
Collegiate Debate Conference. This
conference will be held for the first
time in four years here in Albany
in the spring. About fifty colleges
will be represented by the two hun-
dred student delegates who are ex-
pected to attend. Many questions
covering the scope of state affairs
will be discussed. Further plans
regarding this conference will be
formulated and released later.

Levin Announces
Panel Discussion

The Chi chapter, Kappa Phi Kap-
pa, the national educational frat-
ernity, will sponsor a panel
discussion Monday, at 8:00
P. M. in Room 20. Richardson.
Joseph Levin, Graduate Student,
President of the fraternity, has an-
nounced that the topic will be,
“Should teachers be members of a
teacher‘s union?"

Members of the panel include:
Dr. Harrison H. Van COLL, Chief of
the Bureau of Secondary Instruc-
tion, Mr. John Wright, C.I.O. rep-
resentative, and a member of the
New York State Teacher‘s Associa-
tion, who has not as yet been
chosen.

Paul Merritt, Graduate student,
has been nniiied chairman of the
panel which will be open to all
faculty members and students.

Letters - -

To the Editor:
I would like to ask: what is the

intended purpose of the Student
Board of Finance? Dr. Cooper,
faculty-appointed treasurer of the
Board, told MAA that it was main-
ly interested in auditing the books
of the various student itnanced or-
ganizations, but it would seem that
some of the student board members
think their main job is control. If
the main purpose is really intended
to be control, then certainly the
board should be a. larger, more rep-
resentative grazup.

It was stated that passage of the
MAA amendment would ruin the
whole finance system built up in the
past twenty years. This does not
seem logical. MAA would continue
to keep records as prescribed by the
Finance Board, and MAA’s books
would still be open to audit. The
Student Association constitution
says that Student Council may “re-
quire the Student Board of Finance
to examine and report on the fin-
ances of any organization receiving
support from the Student Associa-
tion budget and to withhold funds
from any organization violating any
rule.” Thus, if MAA sought to
spend money foolishly, this money
could be withheld and there would
be no loss to the Student Associa-
tion,

Failure to give MAA the freedom
it needs will hamper our varsity
athletic program to a great extent.
In order to run such a program it
is an absolute necessity that we be
able to work in close cooperation

and harmony with the Faculty Di- "

rector of Athletics. If We must al-
ways be faced with the necessity of
running to some one else to get per-
mission to make changes, even
though the Finance Board approv-
ed all changes, we still could not
achieve this close cooperation. In
addition, no other organization ex-
cept WAA must change its program
yearly to satisfy changing student
interests, and no other organization
must deal with as many outside bus-
iness concerns,

It was argued that it‘ MAA be
given this freedom, so should other
organizations. I agree, Dr. Cooper
told MAA that at; one time seine
organizations used to pad budgets
and then spend the surplus money
on banquets, trips to conventions,
special awards, etc. Therefore, the
line transfer ruling was introduced.
By keeping such a rate we intimate
that if it were removed. organiz.-
tions would again seek to squander
money.

Whether or not the resolution is
passed rests with you. the Student
Association. I ask you to put. your-
self in the position of an organiza-
tion head, think things over, and
then vote as you see fit.

William Mai‘slaiid, '47,
President MAA.

General View On Resolutions:

Don'tL Make ’Em -

Did you make any New Year‘s
resolutions, or did you consult Web-
ster too, and get the staggering lil-
forniution that a New Year's reso—
lution is it decision made on New
Year's Eve to remain constant; to a
definite purpose during the coming
your. State students on the whole
did not. go all out for the custom.

Joseph Bivinuo, '49, voiced the
sentiment. of thc majority of the
students with the answer that he
made a resolution five years ago
never to make any more and he's
kept it. Patricia Fisk. ‘47. went
practical with a vow to always have
her French done. The same idea
occurred to Mary Otluk. ’49, but,
since she believes Ncw Ycar‘s reso-
lutions are useless. shc made a scc~
ond scincstcr resolution to study
hard. The. most original one came
from John King. '50, who has dc-
cldcd to brush his hair ‘ltltl strokes
