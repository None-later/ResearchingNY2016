action unless additional consideration is given to
their demands this Spring.

A $2,400 minimum' with eight annual increments
of $150 each is asked, in a measure reportedly
introduced by Assemblyman Orlo Brees, Rep.,
Binghamton. This was the-aim of similar bills
previously introduced and defeated in the same
chamber.

While the fight continues in an effort to gain
a living wage for those now in the teaching pro-
fession, it seems that other equally important points
are being overshadowed by the “standard of living”
issue. A recent issue of the State Teachers’ Assn.
publication points out that registration in teacher
training institutions has fallen off in recent years
and is continuing to follow this trend.

 

 

 

 

 

 

  
 
  
     
    
 
 
 
 
 
 
    

The same publication reports that in a recent
survey of high school seniors only a few indicated

 
  
  
 

tenth on the list.

From these few facts it seems fair to conclude
that money—0r the lack of it—is at the root of the
trouble. At prescnt teachers are too often regarded
as a cheap commodity to be bought and sold at
the whim of a school board and are expected to
observe a code of inhibitions that pass as morals.

If teachers are to preserve the dignity and high
repute associated with their profession in other
countries, they must have the means (i.e. cash) to
maintain themselves on at least an equal basis
with average wage earners in less skilled, but, at
present, more profitable jobs.

        
   
 
  
 
   
   
    
 
 
    
 
 

In view of such conditions, it is important that
students here add their small drop in the bucket
in every possible way. Seniors can cooperate by
asking in a reasonable salary for jobs — especially
those that require a lot of extra-curricular work
in addition to four or five preparations 3 day.

And everyone can take the time to send a few
letters where they will do the most good. Don’t
forget, too, that having your parents write to the
local assemblyman is an effective means of securing
action. Another method of giving active support
in this controversy is attendance at Assembly ses-
sions devoted to educational matters. This prac-
tice has been followed by other colleges in Albany
and is just as feasible for students here.

Don’t expect to sit back and relax now while
others do the hard work and then step into a $2,400
job after securing a bachelor’s degree next year or
the year after.

Think it over.

By osmosis tramp

Although it's still a little too ear-

. , , ' ly to Judge how the new semester
bills designed to provide fur- has begun on other campuses we
‘ can, at least look around and see

how the Old one ended.

In Syracuse the semester blazed

to an end when the 40 year old Ar-

c bold gym was destroyed by one
_,  , _ of the worst fires in the history of
groups in other/arcas have threatened further the University,ArcIubo1d gym, bum

as a monument to Syracuse athle-

tics housed the trophies and records
of the teams, and though most of
these were salvaged from the flames
the Physical Education program for
the remainder of the term will be

practically halted. This is due main-
ly to the destroying of the equip-
ment required for the courses and
also to the lack of facilities.

Education from the Funnies

From Syracuse comes also the
story of a Persian engineering stu-
dent who loves to spend his free
time reading comic books. It seems
this young man has been having
trouble mastering American slang,
and has found our American comic
books an excellent way to do 50.

Sing for Your Supper?

At Russell Sage appears that
problem so common to dormitory
dining rooms — that of sing-
ing at dinner. It seems that at

any desire to enter the field, and among their Sage singing is restricted to Thurs-
reasons the “dignity of the profession” ranked day evenings and that songs may

be started only by Seniors. The

others may use this privilege only

if they obtain permission to do so.
What would our poor freshmen and
Sophomores do then?

Wise Remarks

If any of you were rather blue
during exams you should have
browsed through the exam Issue of
the Rensselaer Pup. After several
attempts I have chOSen a few con-
servative little items of interest:

“It is not natural to shrink from
kissing. If it were, most college girls

would be nothing but skin and

bones.”

t
“The old-fashioned girl would

take two drinks and go out like a
light. The modern girl takes two
drinks and out go the lights.”

“Because a girl c105es her eyes
when she is being kissed is no sign
she is not wide awake."

Just one more bit of RPI wisdom,
fdlks—“Conscience gets a lot all
credit that belongs to cold feet."

 

Home Sweet Home

Twelve families at State Teach-
ers College in Trenton, N. J., are
very happy and relieved these days
for the Veterans Housing Project
has at last been completed. Every-
one seems very happy in these
model apartments which are de-
scribed as “roomy and delightful."
similar moving days were taking
place on other campuses too. At
Syracuse, twenty families have tak-
en up residence in the new homes.
Here, contrary to the policies of
most landlords these days, veterans
with families come first, and the
occupation is going on at a merry
pace. As one painter said, “As We
go out the front door the furniture
comes in the back door.” '

Science

Students at Canisius college were
amazed awhile ago to find excava-
tion going on in the science depart-
ment. The solution was soon dis-
covered —— the excavation was part
of the installation of new seismo-
logical equipment to be used in
studying the internal structure of
the earth.

Canisius college has come to the
front with another new idea. They
have been holding a baby contest
for all the doting parents attending
the college. The prize will be an
engraved silver spoon plus $10.00 in
cash which will be awarded to the
winning parents at the Junior
Prom tonight.

Speaking of contests, another
rather interesting idea was pre-
sented by a student at Forodham.
He proposed that a contest be held
to select the “best-dressed" teacher
on campus in order to “raise some
prestige among the faculty.” What
people won't think of next.

Winter Carnival

Fredonia, Syracuse, and even
State have been planning Winter
Carnivals during these past few
weeks. Fredonia held her celebra-
tion the 28th—while most of us
were still struggling with exams.
Syracuse will join us in holding
their carnival this week—end. Here
at State WAA looks forward to giv-
ing the student body a week-end
of fun and frolic to restore our lost
youth and vitality of pre-exam
days.

To the Editor:

With the question of increasing
teachers’ salaries so dominant on
the local political scene, it is dis-
tressing to view the apparent disin-
terest by the majority of the student
body of State College. Although
there are thirteen hundred poten-
tial teachers enrolled at this in-
stitution, scarcely one per-cent
found it expedient to attend the
recent panel discussion on teach-
er organizations conducted by the
education fraternity.

Students at this institution are
in an extremely favorable position
to consider this problem and to
participate in its solution without
fear of economic or social coercion.
State College contains the largest
aggregation of potential teachers to
be found anywhere in this state.
Moreover, proximity to the heart of
political action in this field. should
stimulate a positive attitude toward
this crucial issue.

Somehow. a program must be
devised to inform the student body
of the progress being achieved by
the various organizations engaged
in this campaign and the part that
the individual student, himself, must
play. The recent assembly program
fell far short of this mark!

The student teacher must be made
dynamically conscious of the chang-
ing situation in the field of Educa-
tion. It is not only to our economic
interest. but it is our responsibility
to the community and to our in-
tended profession that we recog-
nize and support this obligation.

It’s unfortunate, but all jokes about Ga.’s two gov-

Admittedly the column isn’t any better than the
rest of the paper this week, but we do have a good
word once in a while and here it is: A new policy in
the Co-op allow a GI to purchase any necessary
supplies “within reason." This el-iminates a lot. of
criticism that was directed against the Co-op. All
(31’s are urged, however, not to take advantage of this
by stocking up on papers and supplies both for your-
selves and the girl friends. Let’s not mess up a good
thing . . . .

About twenty men have moved to the St. Mary's
housing project recently, thus hitting our predic-
tion of 18 Oct. almost on the nose. This is directed at
that lowly individual or group of same who are nested
safely somewhere in the intricate machinery of ad-
ministration of that place. Why does a double room
of approximately 150 sq. ft. rent for $35 per month
to college students (future teachers of your children)
when a three-room apartment of double that area
equipped with refrigerator, stove, ete., rent for $36
per month????

The college administration has nothing to do with
this situation. They and the Alumni Association did
a good job of bringing that figure down from the
skies to where it is now. The blame falls on some
one or some group of people in our local government
who prefer to remain anonymous. We don’t blame you
for wanting to, when such a situation exists. Shame.
Shame. Shame.

But the men who must live there need some fumi-
ture. This is to all sororities and group houses on
campus who have lamps, tables, chairs, pictures, etc.
with which to furnish a day room. If you have any-
thing that you can spare, please drop a note about
it to Stan Abrams. He’ll arrange to pick it tip, and
the recipients will be most grateful. Action.

Pearl Primus and her group rendered a neat. per-
formance Wed nite as evidenced by the huge turnout
and repeated curtain calls. The only criticism of the
night sponsored by D&A and IGC was that it
was too huge of a sell-out. It’s nice to have Albany
people present at such affairs, but not to such an ex-
tent that a hundred students have to view the per-

By VIRGINIA DAY

It happens every year at least
once. and this year it’s going to
happen twice. Yep, we of the
Sports Staff are hanging out the
“Under New Management" sign
and looking forward to a semester
of sports galore, and just as much
fun. In case our predecessor should
happen to cast a glance to the fast
blurring past, we’d all like to take
this opportunity to wish. her the
best of luck in her teaching career.
It’s rather sad to think of all the
gripes we are left to contend with,
and we do mean the Weather. Try-
ing to keep the use of the horrible
word down to a minimum should
prove a job in itself. Getting back
to Pat Sheehan, all we can say Pat,
is that our loss is someone else’s
gain. . . .

Winter Carnival

In case you haven't seen the
various write ups in the NEWS
about the coming Winter Carnival
we’d like to add to the already
thousands of words. Whether
(please note spelling of preceding
word) it rains or whether it snows
whether it's hot or cold, it’s going
to be a gala week-end. Those in
the know say there's one thing in
surplus, and that is lots of fun for
everyone.

Basketball

Basketball has taken it's usual
center in the affairs of college
spirit . . . the rah! rah! type, that
is . . . and the first thing We no-
tice is that the cheerleaders have
blossomed out in some brand new
uniforms .. .. It’s right; sharp they
look, too. However, the student body
still isn’t backing them to the ex-
tent that they should.

cret prize to the group which has
carved the best figurine. The fig-

Psi Gam Heads
Court League;‘

Ploy-Oils Near

With the basketball play-offs ap-
proaching, Psi Gam is in the lead
with three wins and no losses and
Gamma Kap is right behind win-
ning both of its games.

The Group House league has some
close contests in the offing as Far-
rell has won its four games and
Sayles and Pierce have each won
three.

In the latest contests played, New-
man defeated Stokes, Sayles won
over the Commutors, Gamma Kap
beat Chi Sig, Pierce conquered Tom-
my Moore, Farrell topped stokes
and Phi Delt subdued Kappa Delta.

The Newman-Stokes game was
Newman’s right from the begin-
ning as they allowed Stokes only
four points in the first. half while
they tallied 13. The last half was a
repeat performance as both teams
doubled their scores to give Newman
the game 26-13. Golden, Newman's
forward, was high scorer for her
team while Dubert tallied Stokes’
eight; points.

Sayles battered the Commutors to
the tune of 30-2. Engdahl, of Sayles,
scored freely throughout the con-
test to lead her team with 15
points.

Gamma Kap tripped Chi Sig 30-
12 in a slow moving contest. Quinn,
Gamma Kaps stellar forward, was
top man scoring twelve points.
Freel scored eight points for the
Madison Ave. group.

The Pierce Hall aggregation top-
ped Tommy Moore 24-5 to stay up
with the leaders. In the first half,
Pierce had a runaway game, but;
in the latter part of the game the
Tommy More guards tightened their
defense and held Pierce at a stand-
still. Pierce’s Davidson was high
scorer with 15 points.

Boynton scored 13 points to lead
Farrell to victory over Stokes 28-11.
Farrell led right at the beginning
and was never threatened through-
out the game. Dubert again was
high scorer for the Stokes team.

In the last game of the evening
Phi Delta triumphed over Kappa
Delta 18-9. Phi Delt could not get
started and the KB guards held
them down to two points the first
quarter, but as the game progressed,
Phi Delt scored freely with Tilden
taking top honors. Joslin was high
scorer for the Phi Deli: team with
nine points.

What's Camp Johnston? Why

ask any of we twelve State fern-

amist muck and mire, heat and

The weather outside was chi-

it was warm because something
new had been added—a great
big pot-bellied stove, full of heat.
Not only was there heat enough
to pay bridge a good share of
the night but even the usual
chillblanes were missing. But
then there was too much heat
under the beans, which suffered,
no aspersions cast upon the cook.
Speaking of food we’d still like
to know how a certain fresh be-

Sugar flowed and so did the
