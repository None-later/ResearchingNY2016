Clarily Changes
in Big-8 Rules

Myskania has announced the me-

has been done in an effort to clar-
ify the confusion which has arisen.
There are three major considera-
tions on which each production will
be judged: originality, execution,
and audience appeal. After these
points have been determined. a mi-
nor consideration will be given to
class participation and enthusiasm.
Eight points will be given to the ri-
val class winning the Big-8.

ers from the legislature.

Larry Murray, a reporter for the
"Schenectady Gazette” stated that
he felt the only thing accomplished
by the meeting was a display of
disunity among the New York
State teachers, which will hinder,
rather than help, the efforts for
legislative action on salary boosts.

State Students Answer Charges
Oi LocolNewspoper On Cheating

“There is not much cheating here
at State as compared to other col-
leges." This is one response given
in answer to a query by News re-
porters who conducted a survey
among one hundred students.

This poll was motivated by an
article which appeared recently in
one of the local papers. stating that
in regard to cheating at State. the
freshmen seldom cheat, the Sopho-
mores and Juniors cheat a little.
some Seniors become skilled at it,
and the Grads are the worst of all.

It is the general opinion of the
students interviewed that there is
some cheating, but nothing to be-
come alarmed about. Two students
who were approached with the ques-
tion gave out with, “I do not think
cheating at State is extensive.
Everyone is intelligent enough to
know that is not worthwhile."

An answer similar to the above
was, “If you do cheat. it does not
get you far on the exams we have
here." Still another reply that
came out was, “II. all depends on
the teacher’s attitude toward the
students and also the way in which
the course is treated."

When asked if he cheated. one
student replied, “Well. if someone
puts a paper in front of you, you
are not going to ignore it, are you?"

In answer to the same question an-
other reply was. “Yes, I cheat once
in a while, but only on some stupid
exam.”

The NnWs survey revealed that
the distribution of opinion is as
follows; based on 100 students.

Much Some None
59 "/c 41%
77% 22%
83 ‘54. 16"..
60W. 33 "c
50 ‘7“ 40 ‘7!)

By the above figures it is clearly
evident that most students think
there is some cheating going on.
The Grads responded highest among
those who stated that there is no
cheating. and were the only ones
who did not feel that much cheating
is going on. The freshmen seemed
to feel that there is quite a bit of
it, but many, on being questioned
replied. "I really have not been
here long enough to know."

According to the above survey.
the students do not feel that State's
to-be teachers are destined to be
professional cheaters. Students also
expressed the opinion that there is
cheating among all college students,
but the amount here at our own

Declares Policies
On British Stand

In Palestine Issue

Molly Kramer. '47, President of
Brandeis Club, wishes to state the
aims and purposes of the club in
connection with the fact that the
organization has planned no active
program in collaboration with
Brotherhood Week sponsored by the
National Conference of Christians
and Jews.

Miss Kramer states: “American
students of seventy-five colleges
and universities protested Britain‘s
policy in Palestine this past Wed-
nesday, cutting classes to partici-
pate in rallies led by faculty mem-
bers and student leaders of the
Intercollegiate Zionist Federation
of America.

“The Palestine issue flared up
anew as the British clamped mar-
tial law on Palestine, terrorizing
the county in search of members
of the underground, and forcibly
departing Jewish immigrants on
two European ships to Cyprus. a
British deportation camp.

"Although Dov Gruner received a
stay of execution, the evacuation of
British civilians and the reinforce-
ment of the troops in Palestine.
created a new, tense situation, es—
pecially in Jerusalem and Tel Aviv.
When the “Athlit” was sighted near
Haifa. the entire city was placed
under curfew while troops boarded
the ship to seize the immigrants
for deportation. injuring several
people in the ensuing fray.

"We are a nation who believe in
every man's right of life and lib-
erty. We do not believe in using
force when other means have not
been tried. Therefore. let us pro-
test this tyranny of a defenseless
minority by one nation. Let's write
to our Senators Ives and Wagner,
or to General Marshall and urge
them to take action and prevent
more infringements on personal
rights by Great Britain in Pales-
tine. Act now to get notion!"
