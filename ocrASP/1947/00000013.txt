By VIRGINIA DAY
Grim Tale '

Once upon a time there lived in a
large building on Western Avenue
a very large family-aver a thous-
and in fact. Now there were a lot
of other families just like this one
in all parts of the state, country,
and world; and just like all other
families of this particular sort it
was a set rule that the family repu-
tation was upheld by a very few——
five members, in fact, who used to
go out onto what is known as a
court and throw big balls at hoops
that hang on the wall.

Once It Was Different

At first all the members of the
family went to watch the Big Five
every single time they were going
to throw the big balls at the hoops
on the wall, but gradually they lost
interest, and therein, dear reader
lies the tragedy of the tale. The
Big Five thought they just werent
getting the rah! rah! from their
brothers and sisters they should be
getting, and this made them verl’
sad, then very mad.

The real fault did not however,
lie with the Big Five. Like all
families, this particular family al-
ways wanted to keep up with the
Jones's. Since our family had al-
ways been rather poor economically
and athletically, it wasn't always
easy to keep up with the Jones’s. In
fact. in this particular year the
Jones's won 'most all the time. And
how did the Big Five feel about
this? They didn’t like it any bet-
ter than the other members of the
family. but they kept right on
throwing the big balls at the hoops
hung on the wall just as if they al-
ways put more points into the hoops
than the Jones’s.

The Little Five

Our story wouldn‘t be complete
without mentioning the Little Five.
Four of the Little Five are girls.
and one is a boy. At first the dis-
lntcrestecl members of the family
made fun of the clothes the Little
Five wore. and laughed louder each
game because the Little Five stuck
by the Big Five. The Little Five
felt worse and worse. They were
tired of the jeers and comments 01
the family so they bought new
clothes thinking this would surely
make everybody happy. It didn‘t.
And Then There Were None

One particular Friday night thc
Big Five was throwing its usual
party in the largest room of this
large house. and when they got out
on 'ihc court and looked around it
was plain to see the Little Five was
there. the Joncs‘s were there. but
where were the other Dill) members
of the family"?

This was just too much! It. was
the Big Five who had to stand out
on the court and try to beat ihc
.loncs's not the other iiilil nu-mbcrs
of the family. If thcv could talu-
it and keep coming back for morc
with the same dcgrcc of enthusiasm,
why couldn't lhclr broihcrs and
sisters? Wcll. why?

War or Peace?

The story has not yet ended.
The test will be this Friday night.
Arc wc as an lntcrgraicd family unit
going to let our llig l"i\'c down?
Shall wc continue to try to lump up
with tho .loncs's this your. and lcarn
from cspcrlcuca of this season?
Why not do it the easiest and lhc
best way: back thc lily. Fivc, back
the Little F‘lvc, prcscrvc thc unity
of our family unit.

excellent fight against a team com-
posed mostly of former varsity men.
Feeney, in his usual form, was high
scorer for EEP with 16 points fol-
lowed by Combs and Bortnick with
12 points each. At the half Potter

Knit-KB

KDR swamped KB in a fast-mov-
ing game. Monday the 17th. This
victory ties KDR and Finks for
sccond place, figured on the num—
ber of wins. The outstanding play-
er of the evening was Al Stone.
KDR. who tallied 17 points in the
first half and 8 more in the second
half.

In the departmental league the
two games. Sophs Vs. Sr.-Jr. and So-
cial Studies vs Grads, have been

AEPhi Win in

in the first match 575-457. Young
of K1) has to bowl the s"coud game,
but she has to top 173 to bring KD's
ﬁll up to Gamma Kaps 687. so it
seems that Gum Kup has won its
third mulch. Pcris, another man for
1am Kap bowlcd 133 and 174.

AEPhi was hard pressed to take
its match from Phi Deli. and was
forced to bowl tlu'cc gamcs. Fishcr

in Basket League

With the playoffs of Wednesday
night, the championship of the sor-
ority league was won by Gamma
Kap and the championship of the
group house league was copped by
the Pierce Rares. The Washington
Avenue squad met Psi Gamma in
a 19-14 win and the Rares-Sayles
game resulted in a score of 12-6.
Playoffs Draw Near

In approaching the playoffs, Phi
Delt triumphed over Psi Gamma last
Saturday, 18-13. in a contest that
was brilliantly played by both teams.
Tilden, ’48, starred for Phi Delt,
scoring 18 of the final 18 points for
her squad, while Daly, ’48, was high
scorer for Psi Gam with a total
tally of six points.

In the second game. Farrell House
toppled Sayles Hall, 24-18, making
a three way tie for first place in
that league. Boynton, ‘48. set the
pace for Farrell with a top score of
9. while Pless, ’49. sparkplugged the
Partridge Street six scoring 10

The final game of the morning
was won by Gamma Kap as that

the sorority league. Quinn, Gamma
Kap Junior, cleared the hoops for
thirteen points and the high scor-
ing for Beta Zeta was lead by Ma-
glncss, '48.

Championships Decided

The two duckling games which
were played Wednesday night were
close. fast games with each team
displaying outstanding basketball
skills. The first game of the eve-
nlug between Psi Gam and Gamma
Kap found both teams determined
to come out on top. Although Psi
Clam played excellent ball with Sul-
ich, ’49. holding top scoring hon-
ors with 9 tallys. the green and gold

a win of 19-14. Quinn, '48. lead the
victors with a total of 9 points.

Saylcs Hall. Davidson. '47. stellar
player for Pierce. maintained her
scoring reputation with a tally of
7 points. Saylcs Hall, keyed on by
Plcss, '47, highscorer with 5 points,
played a superb defensive game but
failed to overcome the Pierce
champs.

Both productions succeeded very
well in capturing the fancy of the
audience, a fact which was reflect-

presentation to the tenseneSS of the
last.

Mr. Baldwin could not have chos—

People walking in and out. talk—
ing, and smoking . . . Scene: the
State Assembly in session.

The Assembly chamber. lighted
by four chandeliers, was filled with
cigar smoke and the hum of voices
as representatives gathered in
numerous groups to carry on dis-
cussions. ’I‘he Speaker's voice was
heard above the noise of people
entering and leaving the chamber
to bring documents to the repre-
scntatiyes.

The Chamber itself is a high-
ceilingcd room with arched stained
glass windows. The long desk of
the Speaker ls locatcd on a high
platform below the gallery in the
front of the room. wl iii' the Assem-
blymcn‘s desks arr- ;rouped around
the Speaker in u semi-circle.

During chncalay morning's ses-
sion, the Speaker was reading
anicmlmcnts to various bills. stop-
ping only to call for a vote. This
sccmcd to be nothing more than a
lorumllty. as no response to the
question was hcard. und each
amendment was curried. During
the order of business, the Speaker
called for order and read Governor
Dewey‘s resolution to proclaim the
fourth Sunday in September, lntcr-
li‘uith Day, for the furtherance of
inter-racial relations.

After the iuijournmcnt of the As-
sembly at 11:45. our guide conducted
as through the marble halls of the
Capitol, to the chamber of the Sun-
uic. In contrast. to the informality
of the Assembly scsslon. we found
the Senate quietly carrying on
the day's business of law—making.

The house was with Granny. in
the person of Archie Riber, all the
way. The use of a few well-placed
gestures would have added greatly
to an otherwise completely laugh-
able character. The other members
of the cast, we feel, missed a great
deal of the comedy in their char-
acter. Mr. Lisker seemed to have
mistaken stiffness for awkwardness
and missed that part of the humor
in his characterization that addi-
tional action would have provided.

Miss Schoonmaker is to be con-
gratulated on the sensitive handling
of a very difficult play. The use of
background music. something which
we see all too infrequently on the
Page stage. helped a great deal in
establishing the mood and in get-
ting the audience ready for what
was to come. More subdued light-
ing throughout would have been
more in keeping with the play's
funeral theme and would have
made the make-up less noticeable.

The Oscar of the week goes to
Edith Dell for her superb character—
lzation of the old mother. which
was consistent and convincing at all
times. It is gratifying to see that
Miss Dell is as competent in trag-
edy as she is in comedy.

Miss Hllt and Miss Rubin were
unconvincing in their big scene.
though the rest of their perform-
ance was adequate. Mr. Lubey and
the Kconers are to be congratulated

on their intelligent interpretation N

of small but important roles.
