award of 50 fellowships known as
“The General Electric Science Fel-
lowships for Teachers." These fel-
lowships can be held from June 28
to August 9. at the college, in the
fields of chemistry and physics.

Because of provisions made by the
General Electric Company. the fel-
lotvship grants cover tuition fees.
maintenance at the college during
the six weeks, and traveling ex-
penses. Applications will be con-
sidered only from experienced high
school teachers with a bachelor's
degree representing undergraduate
courses in chemistry. physics. or
mathematics.

State Students Eligible

Dr. Oscar E. Lanford, Professor
of Chemistry, wishes to call this an-
nouncement to the attention of all
upperclassmen majoring in Science,
because after a year of teaching
they will be eligible for these fel-
lOWshlps.

Aims of Courses

The course of study is designed
to enlarge each student's grasp of
new developments in physical sci-
ences. It is believed by the educa-
tion committee of the GE. that the
experience on the campus and at
the GE. plants will inspire the in-
structor’s teaching of fundamental
principles. The course includes trips
to the manufacturing plants of the
GE. Company at Schenectady and
Pittsfield, and demonstrations of
apparatus on most recent develop-
ments in the Engineering and Re-
search Laboratories.

Childers Visits

LanguageCenter

Twenty-three students took the
oral credit examination in Spanish
Friday afternoon. February 14.
from 1:15 to 4 PM. and those who
were successful will take an oral
examination. later. Dr. James Chil-
ders. Professor of Spanish. left to-
day to inspect the new phoenetics
laboratory at Harvard University,
as well as the new Language cen-
ter there.

Dr. Childers. in referring to the
exam. expressed the view that it
was quite fair. with emphasis
equally divided between Spanish
and Spanish-American topics. He
stated. however. that training in
conversational Spanish would have
helped. Those who are successful
in the oral exam which will be
given later, will be awarded a cer-
tificate of permanent acceptance.

 

 

Princlle Releases"

State Fair Date

Alice Prindle, ’48, Chairman of
State Fair. has announced that the
date has finally been set at March
15 from 7:30 to 11:30 P. M. The en-
tertainment will consist of a show

Cooperman. '50. Members of com-
mittees. which will include prize,

   

concession, finale, publicity. and

Library Requests.
Aid Oi Students

Miss Mary Elizabeth Cobb. Libra-
rian. has requested the aid of stu-
dents in preventing further removal
of magazines from the college li-
brary. “Magazines have been dis-
appearing at an increasing rate,"
she said. "and are practically im-
possible to replace."

The librarian explained that cur-
rent periodicals are left on the
shelves for six months or a year.
when they are removed to the
stacks and eventually bound. The
library has only one copy of each
issue, and because of limited edi-
tions during the current paper
shortage it is often impossible to
secure a second copy.

The thoughtlessness of those re-
moving periodicals eliminates the
possibility of anyone else using the
magazine in school. Miss Cobb add-
ed. She urged all students to sign
out for magazines and return them
when due in order to facilitate cir-
culation and insure a complete file
for future use.

 

Until this is given. temporary cer-
til'icates will be issued.

Dr. Childers. who is 'm Cam-
bridge. Massachusetts. was invited
to inspect the phoenetlcs labora-
tory and Language center by mem-
bers of the Harvard faculty. The
language center has a number of
new buildings. with reading rooms
and separate libraries.

Carnival Capers

To Crown Fair

As College Converts To Bazaar

With shouts of “Peanuts, Popcorn.
Cigarettes" reaching every ear. the
annual State Fair will open its'
doors on March 15, with all the spir-
it of a carnival prevailing.

Hungry? . . . Just look around for
a. few minutes and you’ll be full
without that traditional trip to the
Boul. How could this be, you ask!
Here is the secret . . . booths, food
booths all over the place. Across
from the P. 0.. the Wren Hall girls
will gladly sell you all the ice cream
you can hold. and down the hall a
few steps you'll get cheerful service
and plenty of candy and apples
from the Kappa Delta cuties.

Better still, if you‘re worn out
after a tough week in school or
just plain lazy. all you have to do
is stand around and wait for the
Gamma Kappa girls to come around
with their trays full of wares. Mys-
kania members will also be glad to
serve you with peanuts from their
stock.

Perhaps you would like a little
something to wash down your meal.

ment of my resignation as President
of the class of 1949. I have, for the
last three semesters. used as an ex-
cuse for my poor grades. the alibi
that holding this class office takes
too much of my time. The only
way I can prove to myself that I’m
capable of college work is to give up
my excuse, and that means resign-
ing the office.

“The success of the class of ’49
in rivalry lies in its student coun-
cil, and I feel that this council will
continue to lead the class as it has
in the past. I want to thank you
for the privilege of working with

Campus Queen Now Reigns
As "Miss Fancy Pants,” ’47

Campus Queens have a pretty
soft life. after all the fun is over
with. It has even come to the
point where their clothes are
supplied for them. Last week.
a package arrived for Sally
Johnson, this year’s Campus
Queen, containing a pair of
"fancy pants," made by a well
known firm. This latest example
of what the well dressed Campus
Queen wears. are a lovely shade
or pale chartruese. measuring
about three yards around the
waist line. The bottom-is fring-
ed like a curtain. and a draw-
string is the only belt. They are
jrecommended for beach wear
and as a substitute for slacks.
though some say they make an
excellent teaching costume. This
latest innovation in women’s ap-
paral can also be worn by the op-
posite sex for lounging and as
an accessory to smoking jackets.

Yes. the bioomer girl has re-
turned . . . returned in chart-
l‘ucse “iuncy pants." My. how
gl‘ﬂlTCllTlﬂ would blush.

Faculty Supports
Teacher's Drive

The unanimous action of the
Faculty Council in backing the cam-
paign of the New York State Teach-
ers Association was supported by a
large majority of the faculty as
shown by the return of the question-
naires sent last week to each faculty
member. Dr. Minnie B. Scotland,
Assistant Professor of Biology and
Chairman of the Council, has noti-
lied Dr. Al'vie Eldred of the New
York State Teachers Association
that the Faculty Council is in com-
plete sympathy with the program
and is willing to aid in securing its
objectives.

The specific legislation, proposals
which are the basic features of the
program are the Young-Milmoe
'l‘oachersSalury Bill and the Young-
Milmoe State Aid Bill which pro-
vide respectively for a minimum
salary of $2400 with regular incre-
ments up to $3600 and the state aid
necessary to put the salary schedule
into effect.

Enclosed in the letter to the As-
sociation from the Faculty Council
were contributions in checks and
cash amounting to $118 as a begin-
ning in the support of the campaign.
