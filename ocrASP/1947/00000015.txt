SAVE-OUR TREESbut SGUTTLE OUR TEACHERS.

Wednesday a large group of P011 Sci students took
off from classes and attended a hearing in the State
legislature. The bill in question would allow trees
on public lands to be cut in order to provide skiing
facilities, etc. The tum-out was commendable. The
subject choosen was sad.

Yesterday morning when the committee on teach-
ers’ salaries reported to the legislature there were
but a few brave class-cutting individuals present.

Our guess is that when the Young-Milmoe Teach-
ers Salary bill gets to the floor, there won't be a
single State College student present.

This is both a prediction and a condemnation.

Anyone, we are told. is welcome to contribute ar-

This publication will publish the results of a sur-
vey which a Sociology class is undertaking. Although
complete returns are not yet in, one question pro-
vides interesting study.

25 per cent answered “never”. 3.5 per cent said
"immediately". and '10 per cent replied "only as a last
resort" to the question on teachers striking. This rep—

Word reaches us that after last Week's infra-mural
slugfest between SLS-KDR, one referee is running
into considerable trouble trying to cash checks "r

Recent ultra-mural and inter-collegiate games
seen on the Page Hall floor don’t leave much to be
said for the sportsmanship angle of the game. It
might sound like high school stuff, but if teams can't
win games there isn’t much reason for their not be-

ff By FRANK WOODWORTH

t. “This week we have been asked to
crusade against some alleged dis-
crepancies in the intramural pro-
gram of MAA. To make a long
story short, what the boys have
been asking is whether or not we are
going to have an IM bowling lea-
gue and ping-pong tournament. It
seems that with the relatively heavy
male enrollment in the college and
the amount of interest shown in 1M
basketball, that We should be able
to organize both of these other
sports activities successfully. Of
course there is the handicap that
the calendar is pretty full at pres-
ent and that the time is running
out fast for indoor activities, but if
we did get started immediately we
could possibly still include both ac-
tivities. At any rate, let's not have
a repeat performance of the base-
ball meeting held last week. It has
been decided that there is a lack of
interest due to the absence or a play-
ing field. If this lack of interest
continues, MAA will be in a diffi-
cult position ln regard to IM sports.
Perhaps it would be a wise move to
give baseball some much needed
publicity. Maybe some of the blame
can be thrown back on us of the
sports staff for not having given
the meeting a little fanfare. To our
knowledge there was no notice given
of the recent meeting other than
the bulletin posted on the MAA
board. We suggest that the base—
ball committee post a list on the
MAA bulletin board which candi—
dates may sign. Let us make this
clear: baseball means intercollegi-
ate Varsity baseball. We had teams
up until 1940 with fewer men than
we now have. Let's make more
than 11 half-hearted attempt this
time.

Last week Sigma Lambda Sigmn
upset Kappa Delta Rho in a wild,
dirty, poorly-played game. This
game was probably the worst exhi-
bition we have witnessed to date.
Its main features were a slugging
match, a broken wrist. water on the
knee and general hard feelings. It
was impossible for either team to
work the ball into the basket be-
cause of the promiscuous fouling.
This type of basketball not only
makes participation hazardous, but
also spoils the grime, both for teams
involved and for spectators. There
was no high individual scoring for
either team.

it looks as though the Grads and
Senior-Juniors will have to play a
rubber game to see who will play
Potter Club for the championship.
From where we sit the the nod goes
to the Senior-Juniors because the
Grads have played inferior ball
since Jim Coughlln left school.
With it little ambition the Sr.-Jr.
aggregation could play good ball.

Battling a stubborn Fink five that
threatened all the way, EEP eked
out a 49-45 decision to hold their

Frat League lead Monday night. ,

The JR.-SR. team upset the Grads
in :1 Departmental League game the
same evening, winning. 24-20.

Led by Bortnick, EEP started fast
but with Olivet pacing the Finks
neither team was able to draw away
and the first quarter ended with
EEP holding a 13-12 edge. Second
period scoring was even also with
the EEP team in front at the inter-
mission, 26-25.

Fouls Decide Fray

EEP's ability to cash in on fouls
proved the deciding factor as a total
of 27 fouls were charged against
the two teams. Third period scor-
ing showed the EEP's still clinging
to their one point margin, 36-35.
Bortnlck was high man for EEP
with 8 goals and 5 fouls for a 21
point total. Olivet led the Finks

with 12.

1n the Departmental League con-
test, the JR.-SR. team upset the
favored Grads, Barber and Sullivan
divided scoring honors with tile lat-
ter dropping in nine while Barber

Friday night. a strong State Col-

contest that proved to be one of
the best games of the season. Al-
though State outscored their oppo-
nents in the last half, the game was
lost in the second period slump——
the final score standing 56-53 in
favor of the visiting team.

State started the scoring as
George chalked up two points on a
lay-up shot. Guter. St. Michael’s
forward. retaliated with a set shot
from the right corner of the court
followed closely by two more points
by Akey of St. Michael's. The
score was tied, 4-4, as Evans of State
made a long shot from the floor.
The scoring wavered between the
two teams until the second quarter
when St. Michael's rapidly took the
lead. led by Yankowski. The score
at the half was 30-19.
