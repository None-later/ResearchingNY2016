Bridge Games In Lounge
Make Spanish “Interesting”

Dos oros, un basto, paso, dos
sin triunfos—that, amigos, is one
way of opening a bridge game in
Spanish.

And por Dios why would any-
one want to play bridge in Span-
ish? Well according to all the
college catalogues, one of the
aims of a modern language
course is to enable the student to
converse fairly well in that lan-
guage. Dr. Childers, Professor in
Spanish, decided that, since most
college students can play bridge,
this would be a good way to ac-
complish the purpose. And so
the alegres companeros were in
the Lounge this week during
their class periods to apostar
contra adversaries, (or in other
words the joyful partners were
in the lounge to bid against
their opponents.)

Ah well, we don't do anything
like that in Greek class, but
then, the Latins always did have
a. reputation for doing work the
easy way.

 

 

 

Nelson Attends
Administrators,
Annual Parley

Dean Milton G. Nelson has been
attending the annual convention of
the American Association of School
Administrators in Atlantic City this
week. A four-year college educa-
tion requirement for teachers and
higher pay were among topics key—
noted at this conference.

In connection with the minimum
education demand it was brought
out that over 500,000 teachers in the
United States have less than a col-
lege degree, and that over 60,000
have not gone beyond high school.
Dr. Donald DuShnne of the Na-
tional Education Association pro-
posed that teachcrs make theirs a
profession equal to that of law and
medicine. To gain that stature, he
said it would be necessary to main-
tain higher standards and that one
of the major problems in education
is to puss law requiring a college
degree for teachers.

Other educators agreeing with
him said that less training is a.
hardship to the children under sub-
mission to incompetent instructors.

Educators agreed that along with
more stringent requirements went
higher salaries. Generally accepted
at the convention was a range from
$2,400 to $5,000 annually.

Dr. Willard Goslln, superintendent
of schools in Minneapolis and chair-
man of the school udinlnistrnt0i"s'
planning committee, said that more
men must be attracted to the pro—
fossion, and that this can be done
only if salary schedules are set up
which would enable a man to sup-
port his family adequately.

Other topics under discussion were
the single salary schedule for cic-
mcninry and high school teachers
and the inadequacy of emergency
teachers.

State Delegates Rival Debaters To  

Attend Session
At Plattshurg

Ruth Bentley, Philip Lashinsky,
Seniors, and Alice Williams, ’48,
left last night to attend the second
Intro-State Teachers' College Con-
ference which is being held at
Plattsburg state Teachers College
and at which each of the 11 colleges
will be represented by two to four
delegates. The conference opens
this morning at 9 A. M. and will
continue until late Sunday morning.

The three-day program will be
divided into two phases. Among
the social activities scheduled for
the weekend are buffet dinners,
banquets, and a dance at Chain-
plain College tomorrow night, and
topics for student discussion will
center around social machinery, en-
forcement of rules of standing com-
mittces, and hazing, both freshman
and sorority.

Topics for Discussion

Other subjects that were suggest-
ed include: plans for new buildings
on campus, campus for State Teach-
ers Colleges, a cut system, financing
of athletics, budget systems in the
schools, housing and a collegiate
syndicate of newspapers.

Exchange Views

The general purposes of the con-
ference are to exchange views of
college life, to keep informed as to
what other colleges are doing, and
to talk over problems which have
arisen on individual campuses and
their solutions.

The Northern Light, the bi—weckly
newspaper of Plattsburg State, has
also made plans to act as host to
an intercollegiate newspaper con-
ference to be held during the Intra-
Colleg'e Conference. At this meet-
ing, delegates representing the vn-~
rious colleges will consider the ma-
chinery of their newspapers and
round table discussions will be held.
The aim is to form a closer bond
between journalistic students of the
state colleges in order to promote a.
more closely-knitted exchange sys-
tem among college nempapers, and
to form a collegiate syndicate.

Students Obtain
SEB Placements

Miss Mary Alberts, head of Stu-
dent Employment Burcau, has an-
nounced that five students have re-
ceived placements through the bu-
reau. Four Seniors and one grad-
uate students have received pesi-
tions.

Elizabeth Harding, '47, will teach
English and Latin at Speculator.
Earl McGee, Grad, has obtained
a position teaching social studies
at Morrisville. Florence Melcsky, '47,
is scheduled to touch French and
English at Lake Luzorne. Albert
Barbary. '47. will be an instructor in
social studies at Mlddlebury. Ben-
jamin Reed, ’47, will teach com—
merce in Cincinnutus.

 

Music Classes To Produce Comic Operetta,
"Ermine," Story Of Vagabonds ln Society

The cscnpndcs of two vngubonds
in polite society in the production
culled, "the most successful opor-
citn of modern times" will be pre-
sented Mnrch 21 and 22 in Page Hall
at 8:30 P. M. Dr. Charles F. Stokes,
Professor of Music, will direct the
Operetta class and the orchestra in
“Erminic,” by Edward Jocobowskl.

Two thieves portrayed by Harry
Mills. ’49. and Stuart Campbell, ‘48,
are very clever in their knavory and
account for their deeds in the most
plausible way.

Erminie, daughter of a Marquis
and played by Jean Snow, ’47. is
about to be betrothed to Ernest, a
young noble whose part is taken by
Curtis Plait. '60. He is on his way
to the betrothal ceremony when he

has the misfortune to meet this
philuntln'opic pair, who. after de-
priving him of his wardrobe, tie him
to a tree. and go in his place. They
explain their inappropriate apparel
by a tale of a holdup and robbery
at the hands of n highwuyman. One
of them is hqu intoxicated and his
remarkably bad manners and lan-
guage nearly bring their whole plan
to a bad end.

Tho music is unusually tuneful
and pleasing throughout. Some of
the better known and greater favor-
ites are the "Dream Song" sung by
Erminio, “The Darkest Hour" sung
in despair by Eugene, and the song
and whistling chorus, “What the
Dicky Birds Say." A full orchestra
will be used.
