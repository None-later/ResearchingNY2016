According to Rae Gluckstadt, '49,

the State College Chapter of the
Intercollegiate Zionist Federation of

consist of a program with Palestin-
ian songs and dances as its theme.

erican square dancing, to the Pales-
tinian songs. Rae Gluckstadt and
Adele Gerow. ’50, are co-chairmen
of the event. Refreshments will be
served during the program.

The S.C.A. speaker, scheduled for

Bridge Games In Lounge
Make Spanish "Interesting"

Dos oros, un basto, paso, dos
sin triunfos—that, amigos, is one
way of opening a bridge game in
Spanish.

And por Dios why would any-
one want to play bridge in Span-
ish? Well according to all the
college catalogues, one of the
aims of a modern language
course is to enable the student to
converse fairly well in that lan-
guage. Dr. Childers, Professor in
Spanish, decided that, since most
college students can play bridge,
this would be a good way to ac-
complish the purpose. And so
the alegres oompaneros were in
the Lounge this week during
their class periods to apostar
contra adversarios, (or in other
words the Joyful partners were
in the Lounge to bid against
their opponents.)

Ah well, we don't do anything
like that in Greek class, but
then, the Latins always did have
a reputation for doing work the
easy way.

 

 

 

Nelson Attends
AdministratorsI
Annual Parley

Dean Milton G. Nelson has been
attending the annual convention of
the American Association of School
Administrators in Atlantic City this
week. A four-year college educa-
tion requirement for teachers and
higher pay were among topics key-
noted at this conference.

In connection with the minimum
education demand it was brought.
out that over 500,000 teachers in the
United States have less than a col-
lege degree, and that over 60,000
have not gone beyond high school.
Dr. Donald DuShane of the Na-
tional Education Association pro-
posed that teachers make theirs a
profession equal to that of law and
medicine. To gain that stature, he
said it would be necessary to main-
tain higher standards and that one
of the major problems in education
is to pass laws requiring a college
degree for teachers.

Other educators agreeing with
him said that less training is a.
hardship to the children under sub-
mission to incompetent instructors.

Educators agreed that along with
more stringent requirements went
higher salaries. Generally accepted
at the convention was a range from
$2,400 to $5,000 annually.

Dr. Willard Goslih. superintendent
of schools in Minneapolis and chair-
man of the school administrator's
planning committee, said that more
men must be attracted to the pro-
fession, and that this can be done
only if salary schedules are set up
which would enable a man to sup-
port his family adequately.

Other topics under discussion were
the single salary schedule for ele-
mentary and high school teachers
and the inadequacy of emergency
teachers.

State Delegates Rival Debaters To Vie ' 

Attend Session
At Plattsburg

Ruth Bentley, Philip Lashinsky,
Seniors, and Alice Williams, '48,
left last night to attend the second
Intra-State Teachers’ College Con-
ference which is being held at
Plattsburg State Teachers College
and at which each of the 11 colleges
will be represented by two to four
delegates. The conference opens
this morning at 9 A. M. and will
continue until late Sunday morning.

The three-day program will be
divided into two phases. Among
the social activities scheduled for
the weekend are buffet dinners,
banquets, and a dance at Cham-
plain College tomorrow night, and
topics for student discussion will
center around social machinery, en-
forcement of rules of standing com—
mittees, and hazing, both freshman
and sorority.

Topics for Discussion

Other subjects that were suggest—
ed include: plans for new buildings
on campus, campus for State Teach-
ers Colleges, a cut system, financing
of athletics, budget systems in the
schools, housing and a collegiate
syndicate of newspapers.

Exchange Views

The general purposes of the con-
ference are to exchange vieWS of
college life, to keep informed as to
what other colleges are doing, and
to talk over problems which have
arisen on individual campuses and
their solutions.

The Northern Light, the bi-weckly
newspaper of Plattsburg State, has
also made plans to act as host to
an intercollegiate newspaper con-
ference to be held during the Intra-
Collegc Conference. At this meet—
ing, delegates representing the va-
rious colleges will consider the ma-
chinery of their newspapers and
round table discussions will be held.
The aim is to form a closer bond
betWecn journalistic students of the
state colleges in order to promote a
more closely-knitted exchange sys-
tem among college neWSpapers, and
to form a collegiate syndicate.

Students Obtain
SEB Placements

Miss Mary Alberta, head of Stu-
dent Employment Bureau, has an-
nounced that five students have re-
ceived placements through the bu-
reau. Four Seniors and one grad-
uate students have received posi—
tions.

Elizabeth Harding, ’47, will teach
English and Latin at Speculator.
Earl McGee, Grad, has obtained
a position teaching social studies
at Morrisville. Florence Melesky, ’47,
is scheduled to teach French and
English at Lake Luzerne. Albert
Bcrbal'y, ’47. will be an instructor in
social studies at Middlebury. Ben-
Jumin Reed, ’47. will teach com-
merce in Cincinnatus.

 

Music Classes To Produce Comic Operetta,
"Ermine," Story OI Vagabonds In Society

The escapades of two vugubonds
in polite society in the production
called, “the most successful oper-
etta of modern times” will be pre-
sented March 21 and 22 in Page Hall
at 8:30 P. M. Dr. Charles F. Stokes,
Professor of Music. will direct the
Operetta class and the orchestra in
“Erminic,” by Edward Jacobowski.

Two thieves portrayed by Harry
Mills, ‘49, and Stuart Campbell, ’48,
are very clever in their knavery and
account for their deeds in the most
plausible waY.

Erminie, daughter of a Marquis
and played by Jean Snow, '47, is
about to be betrothed to Ernest, a
young noble whose part is taken by
Curtis Pfaif, 18. He is on his way
to the betrothai ceremony when he

has the misfortune to meet this
philanthropic pair, who, after de-
priving him of his wardrobe, tie him
to a tree. and go in his place. They
explain their inappropriate apparel
by a tale of a holdup and robbery
at the hands of a highwayman. One
of them is hali’ intoxicated and his
remarkably bad manners and lan-
guage nearly bring their whole plan
to a bad end.

The music is unusually tuneful
and pleasing throughout. Some of
the better known and greater favor-
ites are the “Dream Song" sung by
Erminie, “The Darkest Hour” sung
in despair by Eugene. and the song
and whistling chorus, “What the
Dicky Birds Say." A full orchestra
will be used.

for which they Vere borrowed.
