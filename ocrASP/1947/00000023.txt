‘ I s, i n ,
 Another Week-«another gripe. This one has been
aired before, but with such little effect that it seems

"to merit repitition.

‘ "Delegates to conferences at other colleges in the
state have brought back reports of immaculate
hails,_tiday classrooms, and other indications of
neatness and, order. Even after taking into ac-
count a special house-cleaning in preparation for
such conferences, it is clear that something is def-
initely lacking here.

Approaching the problem from a scientific view-
point, we. have accumulated a discouraging list of
facts. First, there are the butts~—and these can
be found just about anywhere. They litter the
hallway, the floor in the PO, the Commons and
the Annex, and can even be found in classrooms.
The next item is paper, which comes in assorted
types. Scrap paper, lunch bags, candy wrappers,
etc. can be found at any time of the day or night
arranged in tasteful disorder around any waste-
baskct. And this is not the fault of our janitorial
staff 1

And then there‘s smoking—which is carried on
in any part of the school you care to mention. Not
a day goes by when someone doesn‘t light a Cigar-
ette in the lower hall of Draper during the 11
o’clock jam around the mailboxes. Friday is dou-
ble-feature day, because there's also a nicotine
addict in the rush to assembly.

There is one primary reason for such conditions.
and we cannot rationalize by bencvolently blam-
ing them on carelessness. Going a little deeper, we
come up with selfishness, which explains a lot of
things.

We think too much of our own convenience and
comfort to move the extra two feet that mean the
difference between a butt on the floor and a butt
in the ashtray. We can‘t wait for the extra minute
it would take to walk to the Commons or the An-
nex. but have to light up in the hall of lower
Draper regardless of the crowd. And it‘s too much
of a strain to retrieve the paper that falls short
on a fifteen-foot toss to the wastebasket.

lt‘s pointless to appeal to school pride in this
case, \lIICC the offenders either don‘t have any or
conceal it very well. Being a little more practical,
therefore. we‘d like to point out that more drastic
measures will be forthcoming from higher up. It
was brought out at Student Council meeting Wed-
nesday that Dean Nelson, now acting president of
the college. will back up Campus Commission in
its crusade against smoking in the halls and the
general lack of iieatness around school.

The matter has ceased to be a standing joke. and
the t‘oiism’piences could easily be serious. Remember
this the next time you butt a cigarette.

Side-MM! ‘

 

By MARJORIE HARLAND

Students at Devens College, Fort
Devens, Mass, have been campaign-
ing desperately with letters, tele-
grams. and radio broadcasts to
maintain the college which the state
set up for the post-war emergency.
Victory seems to be in the offing
now as public opinion appears to
be strongly behind the student body.
Single Bliss

The bachelors of Syracuse have
organized a club limited to single
men who are planning to remain as
such' indefinitely. The purposes of
the organization are as follows:

(1) To sWenr undying devotion to
the single man.

(2) To issue constructive hints
to women for their self-improve-
ment.

(31 To read papers extolling the
virtues of single blessedness.

(4) To expose the folly of the
bail and chain.

(5) To advise members as to how
to avoid the pitfalls of married life.

Members of the club may have
dealings with those of the opposite
sex provided there are no entangl-
ing alliances formed.

Lady or Tiger?

One eager young swain at Syra-
cuse in order to prove himself as
true as the hero of the well-known
“The Lady or the Tiger" put the
following in the classified adds:
"Wanted—One wild ferocious tiger—
Imniediately. Phone 

The phone number in the add was
that of the cottage where the young
lady lives. There was no peace in
the cottage thereafter for by 2 that
same day at least 20 people had call-
ed to offer everything from tiger
pups to two-tailed lions. Meanwhile
our hero is wondering what. he has
started.

New Dorms

The first of RPI‘s new auxiliary
dorms for single men was opened
a while ago. giving housing to 38

students. The project when com-
pleted wil contain 36 such dorms
and will take care of 720 men.

A national service fraternity. Al-
pha Tau Omega. has been organized
at Rensselaer. This group is com-
posed of former Boy Scouts who are
now in college. and no other re-
quirement than this is necessary.
There are now 104 chartered chap-
ters nnd 16 preparatory chapters of
the frat throughout the country.
New Students

Our neighboring College of St.
Rose admitted two Chinese students
recently. the first to attend that
college. Dressed in their native cos—
fumes the two girls have created

ewmdiaad

To the Editor:

This year a new class of fresh-
men came to State College . . . new
in the sense that they are different.
For instead of finding the usual
class of some geniuses. a few dull
ones and a majority of average. ac-
tive. young adults. we have a class
of scholars.

This I am not decrying. for no
one will venture to say tinii schol-
ars are not useful. and rcrniinly
studios must come first. Iitht‘Vt‘I'.

quite a sensation on the campus.

In the St. Rose Recover-Ian we
also came across the following:

“Early to bed and early to rise

And your girl goes out with other
guys."

“Wolves are like railroad trans—-
you like to hear the whistle even if
you don’t want to go any place."
Rally Day

Russell Sage has completed its
election of new student association
officers and recently held it’s an-
nual Rally Day celebration. This is
similar to our Moving-up Day with
all four classes taking part in inter-
clasa competition.

Sophomores in various colleges
throughout the country are not ex-
actly looking forward to next Tues-
day and Thursday. The reason for
this is easy to see for those are the
days when the annual National Col-
lege Sophomore testing program will
take place with 6 hours. 15 minutes
of working time devoted to the
tests.

Turn-about '

Pierce Hall has always been a fa-
vorite “hang-out" for the men of
State, but it promises to be an even
more popular one this summer. It
seems that the Alumni Association.
noting the attraction which Pierce
has for the men, has decided to
make it their home this summer.
So if you notice signs of a mas-
culine presence in the Pine Room
or the Ingle long after 12 o'clock
this summer remember it‘s all ac-
cording to the rules. As for the girls.
they will dwell in Sayles Hall. I
rather think that some of the
grads are going to be rather amaz-
ed at this turn-abount in affairs.

 

Focus on Future

 

The "State Stars" will play for
the semi-formal dance to be held

A SLIGHT PLEA
TO THE FACULTY

Several weeks ago a letter appeared in the State
College NEWS to the effect that too many classes
were being kept beyond bell time, etc. Evidently the
NEWS dosn’t reach the entire faculty. because we
have heard the same complaint from different quart-
ers since then. v

We won’t hedge. We will say that once in a while,
in the passion of an interesting topic, the zero hour
approaches unnoticed. But when a class is consistently
held over every time it meets. a legitimate complaint
is forthcoming.

Last week in one such class a person who and left
the room when the bell rang. while the instructor was
still lecturing. That may be one way of bringing at-
tention to the fault. Here‘s another: Assignment to be
given at the beginning of the class period, notice to
be given to the restlessness that manifests itself in
a class near the close of the hour. and classes to be
excused Within a minute or so on either side of the
hour. Please?

 

 

III 6' ill

Members of the state legislature zipped up their
brief cases this week after putting in about two
months work and left for home. The anti-strike bill
was passed, the new salary schedule for teachers
passed. the soldier bonus bill passed. Governor Dewey
let it be known that he plans presidential aspira-
tions next year. and the Senators and Assemblyinen
voted overwhelmingly a constitutional amendment to
increase their own salaries. with additional compensa-
tion for those who have additional duties. Oh Well,
wait until next year . . ..

ii ill :1:

For the record: there are 27 school days until Mov-
ing-Up Day and a scant 42 school days left until the
beginning of exams. That's right. that‘s all .

Iii ill ill

A word of congratulation is due to Student Coun-
cil on the new mimeograph machine. Before assem-
bly was over last week the representative from the
inimeo company was putterlng around the Publications
Office. by 12:15 the machine was installed. and in
less than an hour instructions had been given and it
was ready to go. That's the kind of action that we
need more of.

m o at

And it appears that the Commons is undergoing
some sort of revamping. At the beginning of the Week,
it was blacked out while a fuse box was being altered.
heads of organizations having their headquarters
there have received notices about their furniture. etc.
And that's the kind of action We need more of.

t it ’1

Word has reached us that the Class of 1950 is plan-
ning to discontinue rivalry come next year. Some
of the feeble reasons heard is that it is childish.
(check with the pushball players on that one) that it
was instituted by the girls during the war years when
there were no men about. (we will verify personally
that rivalry was in full swing in 19401 and others.

As we see it .the most that can be done by the
present freshmen class is to protest. Next year, if they
refuse to enter rivalry. it will be the first time in the
history of the sport that one team shut out the other.
for they will lose by default.

Aside from this discussion. rivalry has many good
features. It acqualnts the whole class with ii feel-
ing of spirit which, although it dwindlcs to almost
nothing in two or three years. is important when we
begin to look for spirit at State. Many lusting friend-
ships ni'e formed on the field of rivalry. and that's an
important part of an education. It‘s a lot of fun. too.
which you freshmen who contemplate this lllll\'t' IilIIAI
admit.

Think it over. F‘rosh. So what if you did take it
booting from the judges Ill tho (lubnio‘? If your ("illit-
pliiini happens to Ilt' in the way it is l‘llli. check
with your officers. Don‘t buck run of it. You'll miss a
lot of liiii with next year‘s crop of yzi‘wnios ll you do.

dlans tripped the Purple and Gold
Saturday as each team closed their

the two teams cavorted on the big
court.

Lending off the scoring Ken
George hooked a one-hander be-
fore Zellie and Sagendorf set. Jack
Kirby sank a pivot and “Bolo

In the free scoring second half
Tom O'Brien clicked for four field
goals to lead the Statesmen. Zellie.
Drngo and Thompson alternated at

Red Devils Stop
Blueiays, 26-20
In Rivalry Game.

In a thrilling. hard-fought bas-
ketball game, the Sophs triumphed
over the from. 26-20 last Wednes-
day evening to take the first rivalry
match.

The frosh drew first blood on a
foul shot by Free]. Pless and Freel
matched shots and Cookingham
pushed a fotil shot in for the frosh.
Picss throw one in from the side
and Koch added a point to ‘50’s
score. Soulich made a beautiful
basket from the side and time was
called by the Sophs. Cookingham
and Plcss matched foul shots. which
both missed. and Sittig threw a
basket in to end the quarter. 8-5,
in favor of the Sophs. Both teams
were sizing up their opponents. with
the Sophs having a slight advant-
age.

The Sophs got the ball in the
second quarter and it changed
hands four times until Soulich sunk
a foul shot. Smith matched her
point and Piers pushed one in froth
the side.

After the. ball changed hands
again Picss finally put in a lay-up
shot. Time was called by the Frosh
and when play was resumed Free]
ran away from her guard to put in
two baskets. Both teams were
fighting for possession of the ball
when the half ended with the score
13-10.

The frosh took the ball and Freel
scored as the second half opened.
Fast playing was clone by both sides
until Koch sunk a foul shot to tie
the score 13-13. But the Sophs
started to pull away as Pless and
Soulich pushed through baskets.
The fresh took another time out
but failed to halt the Sophs as Sit-
tig tallied to end the third quarter.

Sittlg scored to open the last
quarter and Soulich added a field
goal and a foul shot. Pless and
Smith matched shots and Sittig
added a point. F‘reel scored. Koch
tallied a point and Smith ended the
game with a basket to bring the
filial score to 26-20.
