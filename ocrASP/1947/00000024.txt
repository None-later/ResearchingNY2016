AAAAAAALAAAAAAAAALAAAAA

Judging from all rumors that
have been ﬂoating around the halls
these past few weeks, We may come
back from Easter vacation with the
halls of Draper permeated with the
odor of fresh paint from a newly
colored, newly decorated. and newly
arranged Commons.

Many suggestions have been made
in the past as to the possibilities
for improving the Commons, and
Wednesday night at Student Coun-
cil meeting, Judy Dube and Phil
Lashinsky. Seniors, Were named to
act as co-chairmen to take over the
Job of renovating the Commons. If
the proposed plans are accepted by
Dean Nelson at a meeting Tuesday
afternoon, the co-chairmen together
with their committee, which con-
sists oi‘ Earl Jones, Richard Feath-
ers, Diane Weber, freshmen, Cath-
erine Donneily, ’49, and Alice Wil-
liams and Marian Mieras, '48. will
begin work at 1:30 P. M. Wednes-
day, April 2, and will stay over one
day of Easter vacation to complete
as much as possible at that time.

Suggestions to date are that all
the offices be placed on the right

side of the Commons, with the desks‘

back to back along the wall. Also,
the ping-pong table and coke ma-
chine might be placed in the other
end of the Commons.
