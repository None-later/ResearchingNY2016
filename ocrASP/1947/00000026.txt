We cub reporters are a peculiar
clique. One evening a week we slip
‘seli'Lconsciously into the P.O., break
out our Jumbled notes and proceed
to record for posterity (and our
dear, dear editors) the sports events
of the Week. Our Work is really
simple. All we have to do is dig
thirty, forty or fifty lines out of a
game or match that lasted at. best
an hour's time; or trip through
the dark halls of Draper to phone
an MAA or WAA representative, hop-
ing that they can furnish some
much-needed info.

Let Freedom Ring

A persecuted lot are we Soph
cubs, chasing over to the “Boul” for
Ginny's hot “joe.” or trying to add
up the Finks total wins to Woodie's
satisfaction. There’s always Quin-
ny’s pencil to be sharpened and
Tichy's jalopy to be pushed. Ours
is a routine of slavish drudgery. Ah
. . . but comes the revolution (and
the Soph edition) and the tables
are turned. Our ego is elated as
we move into the editor's chair (and
a rickety one at that), lay out the
assignments, give the orders and
make the fresh reporters dig, dig,
digl

Any basketball fan who missed
the double-header benefit games
Tuesday evening robbed himself of
a whole evening’s enjoyment of ex—
citing basketball. It will be a long
time before any of us witness two
games as action-packed, hard-
fought or close-scored as the games
Tuesday. Both games provided
more thrills per second than any
games played this year in Page.

Congratulations to Edward Eld-
ridge Potter Club (we’ll write it out
once for the benefit of those who
may have been Wondering just what
the "EEP" on the sports page stands
for) for winning the intramural
title and playing out the season
without defeat. In winning the
title game EEP displayed good
sportsmanship and were genial win-
ners.

Before we consign the basketballs
to the moth balls to make way for
spring sports we should like to dis-
cuss the varsity picture. Firstly,
orchids to Coach Hathaway and his
able Jayvee assistant, Paul Merritt,
for their hard work and effort in
making varsity and junior varsity
ball a reality at State. Coaching a
college squad entails quite a bit
more than merely showing up Fri-
day night, breaking out a new game
ball and making substitutions. The
games are really only the climax of
a whole week of long drills and
hard work. It’s your turn, coaches.
Take a long, low, bow.

Soph Salllcs

As is customary. we athletic
minded Sophs usually take this op-
portunity to review the glorious past
and predict the stellar future of the
Sophomore Class in our SOph col-
umn. Not wishing to break tradi-
tion, we too shall boast of the
laurcls which our athletic prowess
have merited us. What other class
of freshmen (that's us one year re-
moved lever plunged into the spirit
of rivalry like we did? Not only
did we win the Campus Day events,
but we took the girls' bowling match
as well. Although we lost the bus-
ketball game, no one who saw those
devils in action can ever say that
they lacked spirit. Our Soph year
has not been without honor as can
be seen by our many victories. We
could go on eternally upon this
favorite subject of ours, but since
we are determined to confine our-
selves to the limits of this column,
we shall force ourselves to write-~-
Finis!

STATE COLLEGE NEWS. FRIDAY. MARCH 28. 1947

EEP, Cops " Loop Title;
Ends UndelcatedSeason

Subduc Grads, 38-30
Taking Eighth Encounter

Pecking away at an early Grad
lead, EEP rallied in the last half to
down the Grads 38-30, capturing
the MAA intramural league title
Tuesday evening. In beating the
Grads, EEP kept a perfect season's
record intact by notching their
eighth win of the campaign.

Play was slow getting underway
in the first quarter and the period
was minutes old before Fran Mul-
len found the range with a push
shot. Miller added a foul before
Hermans set shot started the Grads
on their scoring ways. After Mul-
len converted a foul try, Bob
Coombs set and Bob Bennett con-
nected as the first quarter ended:
EEP, 6; Grads, 4.

Leading off the second quarter,
Fran Hansen notched a foul, and
Quinn set. Coombs followed his
own rebound with a layup, and Her-
mans set as the Grads got under-
way. Bob Sullivan followed his foul
conversion with a layup of a Ben-
nett pass. George Miller set, Bul-
lis ringed a foul before Mullen hook-
ed a nifty overhead toss. Bullis
followed with a set before Bennett
scored a layup to end the half as
the Grads took the lead, 16-13.

Second half play started with
Hansen pushing for two and fol-
lowing with a clever overhead hook.
Feeney layed up,a Coombs pass and
the latter followed with a dandy
one-handed push from the foul line.
After Coombs again scored, this
time via the set shot route, Miller
and Feeney set as EEP edged ahead,
28-23. Hermans connected for two
goals but Mullen, Miller and Fee-
ney kept EEP in the lrad with goals.
Howie Lynch, whose defensive play
was outstanding all evening, con-
nected with a set to end the Grads’
scoring. George Miller was the
main cog in EEP's defense as he
repeatedly got the rebounds under
the Grad basket. Final: EEP, 3B;
Grads, 30. EEP

Flash! Precedent Broken

Sophs And Frosh Agree

Time: 10 p. in. Date: Tuesday,
March 25. Scene: the men's shower
room. Midst odours of "lifebuoy,"
wet towels and steaming bodies,
midst shouts, cheers, yells and crys
History is taking place. Not one,
not two but each and every frosh
agrees wholeheartedly and with no
reservations with not one, not tw0
but each and every Soph that (1)
"it was a tough game,” (2) “I’m
tired."

Never in the ancient history of
State College. let alone in the his-
tory of rivalry, have the two rival
classes come to such unanimous ag-
reement, on any issue whatever.
And there was no doubt about the
unanimity of the concordat as prov-
en by the profound testimony issu-
ing forth from the shower room.

From Joe Amyot was heard: “ 'twas
indeed a tough game and I’d be
more tried than I am if six fouls
were allowed per game.” And Link
Marzello: “I was saving that one
all season, I'm exhausted after that
rough workout." The less talkative
members of the historic assemblage
had this to say. Ben Jackson:
“What a game. I’m ready for bed."
And even shorter but none the less
pointed was Bob Kloepful's: “Wow!
I'm licked."

Rivalry Ping-Pong
Set For Monday

The rivalry ping-pong tourna-
ment will be held Monday. March
31. at 4:30. The event will take
place in the Commons with three
rivalry points at stake.

Betty Winkler, ’49, Captain for
the Sophs, has listed Plcss, Cheat-
ham, and Simon as top players for
the Sophomore team. They will be
practicing over the Weekend in pre-
paration for the rivalry tussle.

The only players announced for
the Sophomore men are Dickcnson,
who is in charge of the Soph team,
and Zanchclll. Undoubtedly, the.
names of the other players are be-
ing withheld for the Sophs are to
i'ace the two MAA tournament
semi-finalists, Margolin and Noble.

The freshman girls, under the
leadership of Adams and Mattlson,
WAA representatives, had tryouts
1n the Commons on Thursday. Their
team will also practice over the
workend in preparation for Mon-
day's contest.

Noble, Coach for the frosh, will
join with Mm'golin to form the
frosh doubles team while L. Walsh
and R. Horsnian will furnish the
other fresh competition.

Frosh Edge '49
In First Frocos
Oi Hoop Rivalry

Cllmaxing a brilliant fourth pe-
riod rally with a thrilling last-min-
ute win. the fros'n Blue Jays edged
the Soph Red Devils 41-38 in the
first of a best-of—three men’s rival-
ry series Tuesday night. Fast, diz-
zy, nerve-tingling play had the
rooters on their feet throughout the
fourth period as both teams fought
bitterly right down to the wire.

Finding the range soon after the
opening whistle, the fresh took an
early lead as Ed Gordon and Pierce
McGrath converted foul trys. Tom
Lisker tallied a goal and a foul.
Walt Schick layed one up and Joe
Amyot set before "Bas" Karpiak
ended the period with a layup.
Sophs, 8; fresh, '7.

Sophs Edge Into Lead

Sparked by "Link" Marzello, the
frosh grabbed the lead and held an
18-14 edge at half time. With
Schick chipping in with five points,
the Sophs came to life to move into
the lead they held at the three-
quarter mark, 26-24.

Leading off the hectic last pe-
riod, Kal'piak looped in a foul try.
Bob Kloepfel scored a layup before
McGrath connected with two beau-
tiful set shots to put the frosh
ahead, 29-28. Joe Zanc‘helli coun-
tered with a layup as the Sophs
moved ahead. "Cy" Fcrsh then
found the range before Bob Kitt-
1'edge took a Lisker pass and laycd
it away. Sophs. 32; fresh. 31.

Marzello Wins Game

Marzello pushed from the foul
line before Zanchelli connected to
maintain the Soph's one point lead,
33-32. Fersh converted two fouls
and followed with a push. Score:
36—33. The Sophs countered as
Zanchelli tossed in a foul and Schick
looped a nifty set to once more tie
the score. The Sophs edged ahead
on Liskcr's foul shot but Marzello's
dazzling set shot from mid court
decided the heated contest and
Karplnk added :1 clincher.

Don’t the varnished floors and

This nciion is prompted by the
loci that smallpox has been brought
into New York State within the

Inter-Group Council To Stage
Folk Festival Tomorrow Night

 

Rivalry Classes
To Hunt Bonner

The freshman and Sophomore
classes will participate in the third
banner innit of the year tomorrow
afternoon from 1 to 5 P. M. Mys—

kania will hide the banner of ’49. ‘

and both classes will search for it.

The ruling on the new banner n
hunt was made by Myskania after ’
the second hunt when the freshmen "

found the Sophomore banner and a
fight ensued. In order to prevent
further violence, the hunt was stop-
pod and a rc—hunt agreed upon.

The revised rules for the Banner
Rivalry, released before the second
banner hunt, will be read just be-
fore the appointed time for the
hunt in the lower hull of Draper.

According lo members of Mys-
kania. the banner will not be hid-
den on the second or third floor of
Draper, in the Auditorium, or the
gym, as well as the other locations
stated in the rules.

As the revised rules stand, after
the day 01' the Illllllll‘l‘ hunt, the
banners in possession of a class
must be kept within the limits of
the city of Albany.

The President of Student Asso-
ciation must know at all times
where those banners are, and must
be notified of any change in the
location of the banner.

Banner rivalry shull close at mid—
night preceding Moving-Up Day,
and not before. Both banners must
lll' given to the President. of Stu-
dent Association between midnight.
and eight o'clock on the morning of
Moving-Up Dny.

Whoever is in possession of both
banners, at midnight preceding
Moving-Up Day. has thus gained
for his class fch points.

A class shall not move the billl-
nexus of classes or orgunlmtions not
purllcilmling in the innit, i.c. bun-
ncrs in the Commons.

No outside help is allowed, whal-
sol-yer.
