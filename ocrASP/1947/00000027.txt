The Time Is Now . . .
. Today in Assembly, nominations will be opened
for the officers of next year’s Student Association.
EVery person there will have an opportunity to
put. up for election the person he thinks can cap-
ably fill an office. Serious consideration should
be given to both nominating and voting, for upon
the shoulders of the winners of the coming election,
rests the government of State College next year.

The school year of l946-’47 is on its way out
now. No one can deny that the officers this year
have done a superb job, unaccustomed as they
might have been to the revised constitution, includ-
ing the new Myskania set-up. They executed their
duties efficiently and well and it will be up to the
new officers to keep the ball rolling.

While the leadership material is available, the
essential ingredient for choosing the leaders—loyal
and alert voters—is not quite so prevalent. The
question is, how many students realize their duties
as students at this State Teachers College? In so-
cial studies classes, in Ed. 10, many words are paid
to. the respect that “children in school should be
taught their duties and privileges as citizens”. When
applied to themselves however, the tendency is to
disregard any awareness of duty as rubbish or is
admitted, ignored.

Often is heard the complaint that with so much
school work little time is left for active participa-
tion in student government. Admittedly, this may
be so and naturally, school work is of primary
importance. Yet if all the time wasted was utilized
in constructive outside activity, time could be
found for everything.

Every student at State College is first and fore-
most a member of a largely autonomous student
body. Tuition is paid by the State. I return each
student is expected to be the best in the teaching
profession, willing to accept reasponsibilities. He
is expected to have a certain pride in what he is
doing as a molder of the minds of future citizens.
Teaching is an important job, influential in the
country, a profession to be respected as any other.
But responsibility cannot be assumed unless one
is accustomed to it. It is not like a cloak—to be
thrown on and then off. Now is the time to act
positively in the right direction.

In the offing is something which requires the
interested participation of each and every person.
The wise selection of officers will prove that
we want State College to progress and not re-
trogrcss. Sororities, fraternities, and even personal
friendships should be forgotten when you nominate
your candidate today—and definitely, when your
vote is cast in two weeks.

By ELOISE WORTH

Before Spring colds set in (or
get caught—and that's your own
business) let me remind you that
it’s too early to cast off your winter
cloaks. However, if you are the
unfortunate recipient of a cold-—
wrap your head in a thick woolen
cloth, get into a steaming hot bath—
get out—drink one glass of boiling
water mixed with two parts horse-
radish, and three parts of your own
brand, and go to bed. (If you find
breathing difficult, loosen the cloth
around the nose and mouth.

Did everyone have a nice vaca-
tion? In her grammar class a prac-
tice teacher wrote on the board,
"I didn’t have no fun during my va-
cation”, and asked, “How should I
correct that?"

“Get a boyfriend”, was the reply.
It says:

In the New York State Driver's
manual, “If you lose your license,
change your name by marriage or
otherwise—J’

In Mark Twain’s biography, “In
September he started Roughing It,
and in November his son was born.”

In the Statesman of Devens Col-
lege, “Girls know who they marry
before boys."

But the one that shocked me most
was a headline in the Oswegonian,
“Lens and shutter exhibit in Gal-
lery.” Such goings on! They should
be expelled!

Campus to Campus

Nothing Inuch exciting is happen-
ing in other schools—«the post-vaca-
tion slump has already set in. They,
too, are busy balancing their bud—

gets, and holding elections.

The Daily Texan says, “The prof.

“And your name, son?"

“Jule, sir."

“You shouldn’t abbreviate. Your
name is Julious.” The prof. went
on to the next student.

“Billions, sir."

Looking for a job?

Says Mademoiselle: “As for jobs

on steamship lines, the number of
openings is very limited and even
waitress jobs go to union members
this season."
Journalism: “ . . . if you want long
hours, hard work, a small salary,
and a lot of fun, take a. job on a
country weekly.”

Volunteer work overseas: “If you
are a pioneer at heart and have
$500 to $600 to spend during your
summer vacation, you can go on one
of the American Youth Hostel
Work Projects to Europe.”

Playground work: “As a play-
ground assistant you might . . . su-
pervise games, break up fights, pre-
vent the kids from standing on the
swings.”

Dude ranches: “. . . a young
healthy, pleasant-looking girl with
summer hotel experience might
prove, with a good letter and a pho-
tograph, that she’d fit in.”

There's always summer schoolll
Summer schools abroad are offer-
ing special courses for Americans
this year, as over 20 European uni-
versities open their doors to under-
graduate, and graduate students.
Veterans may study under the G. I.
Bill. One hundred - twenty - four
hours do not a teacher Inake——nor

To the Editor:

This is just a last (lying yell
against the women's gym classes at
State College, I'm making Iip all
my cuts in gym so that I won‘t
have to take it. next year. Let’s hope
that by then that I can forget the
inconvenience and the l'utility of
the physical education program.

It. isn't the poor lone instructor’s
t'aiilt that the classes are a waste of
time Shc docs licr bcst to make
things go so that at least a. pro—
gram is prcsciitcd but tlicrc isn’t
much slic can do against the (wor-
\vliclinlng odds.

Every gym class has something
like fil'ty woiiicn, the gym is small
and about all the class consists of
is u scrics of wliistlcs to which
the squads inch around trying out.
tiic various gym facilities and got-
tiiig a taste ot' what it real gym
class is llkc. ()ilti plays basketball
for fch inlnutcs, llli'il ping pong.
thcn shuffle board, thcn something
cisc. Altcriiatc classes bowl at Rice's
tat $.25 II gamut.

The point. is nclthcr tho fucllilics
or the supervision is adequate. it‘l-
thcr gym classes should be abolished
ttlien we could study during those
pcriodst or else the gym should be
cnlargcd or a bigger staff hired. And
speak not of money to ma. If the

date party in

 

 

state wants us to take gym it can
put up the money. This is the Ein-
pire State and we are its teachers.

Overent
To the Editor:

The list for Myskania is out. Peo—
pie spent all day Tuesday looking
at it but we wonder if they have
looked carefully. On both lists there
are names followed by a long list of
activities. They look very impres—
sive, but are they?

Looking over some of the activi-
ties we noticed things which are not
the least indicative of leadership
ability. What these activities are
doing on the list we don’t know. It
seems that very little discretion was
used in selecting people l'or the
two lists.

There is nothing to be done about
placements to the two lists, but

Student Association can still do
something.
Look over the two lists again,

carefully! Weigh carefully the ac-
tivitics under cacti name and make
your choice not by “suggested” and
"rccommcndcd” but by thinking
carcfuly and voting accordingly.
Disillusioncd

To the Editor:

A new plan has been suggested
for tlic annual Moving-Up Day exit

step towards removing another tired

liook.

Regretful

The Common-Slater is given the widest latitude as
author of this column, although his viewpoints do not
necessarily reflect those of the State College News.

With Easter vacation now but a fond memory (gone
are those good old pre-warning days) ye olde scribe
wishes to remind his pair of readers that there’s only
twenty-nine school days until next vacation—Memor-
ial Day—and exams. Before you know it, exams win
be pressing and you won’t have to choose betWeen
the lesser of We evils and read this trash during
Assembly.

For the info of those wondering if we gave up
the ghost last issue, the Sophs put out the paper
all by themselves and did a nice Job.

Orchids
’49, incid, deserves a nod of approval for their

show “And Four to Co.” We have our fingers crossed
in the hope that some check was taken with the
Broadwayites on the melodies used. The cast will
present the show again for the veterans at Mt. Mc-
Gregor.

Several members of the student body did a. nice job
in helping to remove from our presence a threat to
morals. To those of you who remember Dr. Sayles'
address in Assembly last fall, we are pleased to report
that the person to whom reference was made in that
talk has been discovered, removed from school and
from his job, and is now allegedly being handled by
the federal authorities.

Several comments overheard (with apologies to Mr.
Cafaro) in the Corrnnons, that old all—traction room

ping pong players can exhibit their skills without
the risk of tangling with a pillar when retiu'ning a

the way in inter-collegiate activities to any degl'cc.
In addition to meeting debate squads from all parts

NEWS Needs
Variety, Men,
Poll Reveals

Have you any gripes about the
News? Had you been in the lower
hall of Draper or the library or
elsewhere in this industrious hall of
learning Wednesday night you
would have had your chance to ex-
press them.

The general concensus of opinion
seemed to be that there was not
enough of the male element on the
staff, particularly in sports. This
came from girls as well as fellows.

The style of stories was a much
mulled over topic. Many thought
that the News should use more fea-
ture articles. Others stated that
the stories were too stereotyped.
Bill Dumbleton, ’50, vehemently
said, “Why don’t they use nick-
names? It's too formal."

Some kind soul suggested that
there was too much alliteration in
the headlines, a condition which did
not lend humor to the paper.

Lois Hutchinson, '47, remarked
that there should be more of a per-
sonal touch, that is, “So-and-so's
engagement, you know."

To augment Miss Hutchinson's
suggestion, Jean Ineson, ‘49, sug-
gested the News run a personal
notes column without letting it be-
come what is commonly known as
a “dirt” or gossip column.

Miss Ineson also recommended
eliminating the stereotype style of
the paper whereby everyone knows
what is going to be in the News
for the week. More coverage of
past news would add a little varia—
tion «meaning a review of the Big-
8's, skits, criticisms of dances, plays,
and conferences).

The point upon which all inter—
viewed seemed to agree was that the
News needs more controversial
material, "Hot issues, to you."
Cathrine Donnolly, ’49, suggested a
weekly column in which students
\vcrc given a chance to express op-
inions on a particular matter which
was “on the fire" for that week.
Miss Donnelly also commented that
the News have a real cartoon con—
test among art students and have
a cartoon in every week.

There are always a few humorists
in the crowd and Wednesday night
was no exception. Heinz Engel, ‘50,
would like a weekly recipe. He also
gave a serious comment stating that
tho Common-Statci"s name should
bc on his column.

Urncc .loiics, '40. rcqncsls a cross-
word pnlec every week (“to do in

Request Senior Attendance
Frank Woodworth, President of"
tlic Scnior class, has requested all

Seniors to attcnd future class nicct-
lugs as they concern graduation.

Ht Iidclit .\hh0(‘illl ion
. . , . . . . . , . .. 527,313.“)

Seniors may order their gradua-
tion aIinounccnicnts. personal cards,
and graduation booklets, Monday.
April 21. in the 00-01). There will
be a poster on the Co—op bulletin
board for all those who wish to or-
der their torches. They must sign
up in order to get them.

State College has a star in its
midst, and even Ingrid Bergman is
worried about her future. For Eli-
zabeth McGrath, ’47, is going to
play Joan in Maxwell Anderson's
play, “Joan of Lorraine,” at Siena
College, May 19, 20. and 21.

This is the first amateur produc-
tion of Anderson’s play, since its
presentation on Broadway with In-
grid Bergman in the title role. The
play has a dual role to keep the
poor actress busy; that of Mary, as
the lead in the play “Joan of Arc,”
and the actual role of Joan. The
transition between the two charac-
ters makes the role very difficult to
play, requiring a versatile actress.

There is a good chance that Max—
well Anderson will direct the last
rehearsals of the play. According
to the original plans, Anderson had
planned to direct the play, but
when the production was temporar-
ily cancelled, he was notified not to
come. However, Father Francis
Reilly, director, has been trying to
contact him since.

Try-outs for the Siena play were
held Monday night at the college.
Miss McGrath, the only contestant
for the part from State, was com-
peting with several women from lo-
cal colleges. When asked how she
felt about the part, “Liz” replied
she was very surprised when she

was selected and “there's lot of
work in it."

Miss McGrath was originally a
member of the class of 40. In her
Junior year, she enlisted in the
Woman's Army Corps, as a private.
After her discharge at the end of
the summer, she returned to State
to complete her fourth year. During
her first three years at State, she
was on Dramatics Council and par-
ticipated in college dramatic pro-
ductions. Miss McGrath played the
lead in the Elementary Dramatics
production, “The Princess and the
Page," in 1943.

The play, “Joan of Lorraine,’ has
as its theme, the production of
“Joan of Arc' by a cast of very
modern people, including the star,
Mary. Through gradual transition
in scenery, the story of Joan her-
self, becomes the dominating theme,
and the play ends as Joan goes to
her death. Mr. Anderson has at-
tempted to compare the religious
and philosophical ideas of today
with those of Joan’s time. Experi-
mental in its nature, it has been a.
great success on Broadway. How-
ever, Mr. Anderson is trying to prove
that it is the play, as well as the
star. that has been successful. Two
other colleges, one in the midWest
and one in the west will also pre-
sent "Joan of Lorraine” this year.
