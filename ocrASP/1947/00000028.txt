The following letter was received
from the Superintendent of the Al-

tion of "Ermine."

Dear Music Council:

I am told that you were largely
responsible for making the arrange-
ments for our children to attend
the Operetta “llrminie” at State
College last Friday evening. Al-
though I know you appreciated
watching their enjoyment, not only
in seeing the Operetta but in being
taken back stage, I want you to
know that their comments here
indicated that it wa s a big experi-
ence for them and one which they
will all remember.

Kindly pass on our expression of
real gratitude to the others in your
group who assisted in fostering this

The Jonquil Jump is back . . . for
the second consecutive year, and
spring is really here at last. This
time the Pierce girls will dance to
the music of Metro Myresko and his
orchestra, with a background of
fresh jonquils and yellow canapes.
The logic Room is ready to blossom
forth for the annual Pierce Hall
formal.

The dance, scheduled for Saturday

night, April 26, will last from 9:00
PM. to 2 AM. in the famed Ingle

Room, with decorations of yellow
and green canapcs, to set off the

yellow jonquils. Sheila McGinnis,

spring formal, with Dorothy Caugh-
rcn, ’47, acting as co-chairman.

tempt to establish a tradition for
the Pierce Hall spring formal. In
other words, this is a gentle hint for
next year's chairman. Jonquils re-
mind one of spring, don’t they?

According to Miss McGinnis,
only women living in Pierce Hall,
and their escorts will attend the
dance. A limited number of tickets
for guests will be available through
women living in the dorm. It really
isn't fair to build you up and let you
down, but maybe you can start
apple-polishing your friends at
Pierce. It might be worth a try.
When spring is here, and a young
man‘s fancy lightly . anyway,

Dorothy Walejsio, Juniors.
