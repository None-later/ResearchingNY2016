News Poll On Budget,-

MAA, Ped Provoke Discussion

In answer to last week's request
for a column in which students are
given an opportunity to express
opinions on matters which are "on
the fire" for the week, the News
conducted a poll this week on the
question, “What are your objections,
if any, to the student Association
Budget?”

Alas, we really started something.
According to most of the students
whose opinions were requested, no
one, unless he has studied each or-
ganization and its particular needs
with much care, is qualified to
speak on the subject.

Joy Simon, ’49, expressed herself
as follOWS: “I have no objection to
the budget as it stands, because I
do not think that any organization
on campus would try to ask for
extra money, unless they needed it
or planned to need it. However, I
do object to the needless throwing
away of money just because Assem-
bly comes before lunch periods."

Of course, MAA was thoroughly
bashed over, said Sandy Heslin, ’50.
“It seems an awful lot of money for
MAA. There are a lot of associa-
tions who deserve it more, like Ped."

Bob Kittredge, ‘49, thinks the
MAA budget should be discussed
most thoroughly. Mickey Seaman,
‘49, believes that MAA has too much
money for minor sports and that
WAA has not enough because more
students take part in WAA than in
the men’s sports. Bev. Sittig, '49,
agreed vehemently with Miss Sea-
man. ‘

Eugene McLaren, ’48, gave this
statement: “I have no objections. I
do think that must students take
too little interest in it, apparently
taking the attitude that since they
have to pay their student tax any-
way, it makes little difference who
gets the money. In regards to the
MAA budget, students should re-
member that the largest part of it
is for varsity athletics which repre-
sent all the students not just the
men."

 

Alumni Calendars

Annual LUHCTICOI‘I

The Metropolitan Branch of the
Alumni Association has scheduled

The opinion of Gifford Wingate,
, and of many others was that
MAA is spending too much on var-
sity athletics and not enough on
intramural sports.

Alvin Feldman, ’49, ends our dis-
cussion on MAA and begins our
next item of business by saying that
Pedagogue’s budget should be item-
ized and that we’re giving too much
to MAA. “This is not an athletic
college and we’ll never get into ‘big
time’ anyway.”

Catherine Donnelly, ’49, expressed
her opinion on the topic of Peda-
gogue with the following, “Ped has
got to have money in the thousands
to publish a college yearbook. Give
your money now so they won’t have
to ask for more later on.”

Senior Jean Elting, who, incident-
ly, is also Editor of the Pedagogue,
said, “I don’t have any objections,
I’m all for Ped naturally. The more
money you give them the better.”

Erna Burns, ’48, commented that
there should be more money for
Ped so the students wouldn’t have
to pay for it at all.

J. Michael Hippick, ’47, gave us
the following statement: “The bud-
get is not broken down sufficiently
both as to expenditures and receipts.
It’s a big waste of effort to let each

State To Attend

Sage Conference

Gerhard Weinberg, ’48, and Jean
Pulver, '49, have been appointed to
attend the annual spring confer—
ence at Russell Sage College. The
main business of this meeting will
be to discuss various campus activ-
ities.

Besides the customary discussions
concerning Student Government,
Publications, Inter-Faith, Drama-
tics, and Athletics, a new emphasis
will be placed upon the method and
desirability of stimulating participa-
tion and interest in campus activ-
ities. Attention will be paid to the
importance of enlightened citizen-
ship ln all phases of life. as it may
originate in and expand from the
nucleus of an active campus life.
The proposed National Student Or-
ganization will also be discussed at
great length.

Five discussion groups will be held
during the morning and afternoon
of April 26, scheduled so that each
delegate may attend as many meet-
ings as he wishes. These discus-
sions will be led by visiting stu-
dents who have done outstanding
work in the various activities under
consideration.

Crusade Against Smallpox
Causes Scratching Epidemic

Prompt action by Dean Milton
G. Nelson has probably averted
any possibility of a smallpox epi-
demic at State but has caused an
epidemic of another sort. Ever
anxious to carry out the wishes ,
of the Dean, students are begin-
ning to go around with the white
patches on their arms conspicu-
ously exposed. And conversa-
tions run something like this,

“How much did it cost you?”—
2 bucks! Why the . . . soaked
me 3!

But aside from providing a re-
freshing change from discussing
elections the Vaccinations are a
nuisance. The truth of the mat-
ter is that they itch. It is ru-
mored that students are asking
to be excused from class saying,
“Please may I leave the room?
My vaccination itches."

Colonial Theatre
To Show French
Motion Picture

“Les Enfants du Paradis,” called
by critics France’s answer to “Gone
With the Wind,” will be shown at
the Colonial theater during the
week of May 5. Special rates will
be established for students who
wish to attend the third U. S. show-
ing of this film.

French dialogue has been supple-
mented by English subtitles for Am-
erican audiences, and the movie has
been cut from its original length to
a running time of two hours and
twenty minutes.

The title “Children of Paradise"
refers to theater audiences in what
would correspond to American
“peanut galleries,” and action oc-
curs in and out of theaters lining
the “Boulevard of Crime” in Paris.
Although reviewers have charged
“Les Enfants” with vagueness of
theme and lack of unity, they are
in accord on its general excellence.
Characterization is the chief at-
traction of the story, which is in
the “laugh-clown-laugh” tradition,
and it has been suggested that
looseness of plat was intentional.

Now in its second year in Paris,
“Les Enfants du Paradis" had its
U. S. premier in Los Angeles and
is also showing currently in New
York.

Sophs Capture Plattsburg Team To Face

 

 

RITA SHAPIRO

Since the last of my term papers
had been handed in and since
Spring had come to Albany (joke),
I thought that now would be the
ripe time to take Sports Page. But
Jack Frost double-crossed me and I
started pulling my hair Sunday
morning wondering if there would
be any neWS to print this week. Of
course I had reckoned without our
efficient snooping sports staff and
John Dooley, and this page Is the
result of their hard work.

When?

During the war years State barely
fielded a six-man touch-tackle foot-
ball team. The students were re-
membering the days when State had
its name high on the lists for In—
tercollegiate play. Everyone was
asking the question when. When
will the basketball team be organ-
ized again? When will Tennis and
Baseball be back?

Basketball came back and attend-
ance at the first games ovci'flowcd.
We admit that the basketball sea-
son wasn’t as successful as anyone

had hoped for, but this wasn't
Coach Hathaway 's or the follow
fault. It was heavy competition

and lack of material. If the stu-
dents had supported the team. as
one of State's teams could have been
supported, maybe some of those
close contests could have been luck-
ed up in the win column.

Spring- sports are the topic 01 flu-
day now and several tciiiiis imitchcs
have been arranged with loading
schools. Baseball is still on an in-
formal schedule but games hch
also been planned. Let's not have
only the substitutes oul. lhci'c

Bowling Match,-
Lead In Rivalry

The Sophomore women copped
two rivalry points Wednesday when
theydcfeated the frosh women in
bowling. Rolling on the Pladium
alleys, they led by 134 points as they
took the first two games.

In the first game, the Soplis land-
slided to a 101 pin victory. Led by
A. Adolfson, hitting 154 in an eight
murk game, the Sophs had little
trouble downing the frosh. In the
second contest of the series, the
frosh led through the seventh frame
111 a much closer match. A seventh
frame spare series for the Sophs
brought about the last minute rally
which netted them a 33 pin win. M.
Southwick was high scol‘cl' for the
fi-osh, chalking up u 153 game.

Noble Captures
Ping Pong Series

The last game of the MAA ping
pong tournament was played off
Wednesday. Warren Noble ’50 down-
cd last year‘s winner, Paul Wagner
‘48, to become the new champion.

Wagner proved to be little compe—
tition. He was outclassed by Noble
who remained undefeated through-
out the tournament.

The winner took three out of five
games, the first game being the
closest. Wagner was off to a good
start but Noble pounded through,
winning 21-19.

Both the second and third games
were Noble's from the start. Wagner
proved to be weak in his drives and
Noble made the most of it, grass—
hopping from side to side of the
table, making every shot count. The
last two games were easy victories
of 21-16 and 21—15.

Other Competitors

Noblc began his winning spree
by defeating Gordon and Oarr. This
left Millcr, Mai'golin and Wciiier
iii the field. Miller kept Noble on
his locs. giving some stiff compe-
tition, but Noble was the better
man. Margoliii won over Wclner and
became Noble‘s competition and
conquest.

In the other set Wagner gained
his place in the finalist bracket, sci.-
liug buck Louder, McCllntock and
Zippiii. His win over Mullin, who
look third place in the tournament
qualified him for the finals.

. : At a meeting held Tuesda noon
Five-Man Tenn: SQUOd the captains of the Intramural

Tomorrow afternoon State’s Var-
sity tennis campaign gets under
way as the Purple and Gold net-

Softball league revised some of the
existing rules. The Intramural
schedule was also drawn up.

The following changes have been

men meet the Plattsbui'g Teachers made in an effort to bolster the de_

at 3 o’clock on the Ridgcfield courts.
Fran Mullin. veteran State campaig-
ner, is acting both as captain and
coach of the varsity squad. This
is the first match on an inter-
collegiate schedule which already
lists three games with two other
matches pending.

The weather has played tricks on
the tennis squad in particular, leav-
ing the outdoor courts in poor con-
dition for fast matches. Several
scheduled practices had to be can-
celled with the result that the squad
is far behind in its training routine.

To Name Team:

In playing its first intercolle-
giate tennis since 1942, State opens
against the same opponents with
which they got the ball rolling in
’42, Plattsburgh. That year State
breezed to a 5-1 victory over their
northern rivals.

Handicapped by lack of practice,
the squad enters the Plattsburg
matches practically cold. Mullin has
indicated that the men playing
against Plattsburg tomorrow will
not necessarily compose the five
man squad he plans to carry. He in—
timated that the squad is in the
formative stages. To date Bob
Merritt, Fred Root, Clancy Oarr,
Sy Fei'sh, Bob Kloepfel and Bob
Van Damm have shown promise
of holding their own against inter-
collegiate competition. Doc Hoyt,
Don Dickinson, Lou Rabineau and
Cal lepin are battling the afore-
mentioned candidatcs for the five
positions.

Mullin. stalwart of the ’42 squad
which boasted victories over Platts-
burg, Cortland State and Hartwick,
is set to lead the courtmen into
action tomorrow. The rangy junior
has given every indication in prac-
tices to date that he will be hard to
beat once he gets his deadly ser-
vice clicking.

fenses:

l—A ten man team instead of a
nine man team.

2—The base lines will be sixty feet
long instead of 55.

3—No bases will be issued to a
batter struck by a pitched bail.

4—No man can transfer after
playing two games with one team.

5—Sneakers will be worn; no
cleats will be allowed.

6—Names of new players must be
given to Al Stone, '47, six hours be-
fore game time.

7—Eligibility is the same as for
football.

Weather Retards Schedule

Games were scheduled for last
Tuesday but due to the snow did
not start till Thursday. The games
will be held on both Page field and
the Dorm field at 4:30 on Tuesday,
Wednesday and Thursday. If at
least 8 men on a team do not show
up on Page field by 4:40 or on the
Dorm field by 4:45 the match will
automatically be forfeited.

The following teams have signed
up for the league: Van Derzee Hall,
EEP, KDR, Gents, Grads, St.
Mary's, KB, SLS, and the Finks.
Rifle Club

A Rifle Club is being organized
as an intramural club under Lewis
Sumberg, ’48. The club is being set
up as a permanent club this year
so it can become affiliated with the
National Rifle Association.

A qualifying shoot is tentatively
scheduled for April 26. To date six
men have responded. Rifles must
be furnished by individuals.

Anyone interested should contact
Sumberg or Stone.
