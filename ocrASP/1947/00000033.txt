Down The Drain . . .

Today marks the culmination of three hectic
weeks of nominating, campaigning and various
other activities associated with annual elections——
all directed toward the few minutes that it takes
to mark a ballot and drop it in the box.

It is unfortunate that all the planning and energy
put forth by individuals and groups during recent
weeks can be poured down the drain by the care-
less voting chaructcristic of Student Association.
We grant that the first encounter with preferential
bailotting may be very confusing, but everyone—«-
including the ireslunenv—slzould be familiar with
the system by now. Unfortunately, this is definitely
not the case.

Voting in alphabetical or reversc-alphabetical
order, or using any of the other indiscrimimtnt
systems employed here with dismayng frequency,
docs note—~and never \vill—w-constitutc intelligent
voting. Copying your neighbor‘s preference is no
better.

Those individuals who have so little interest in
student affairs that they cannot take a few min-
utes to read the nomination lists and do some
advance thinking are throwing the whole system
out of balance. Such people would be doing the
whole school a big favor if they did not vote at all.

'i‘hcre's another fly in the ointment that should
be eradicatul. The very name "preferential" indi-
cates that the voter is given a chance to express his
second, third, etc. choice in casc his first. prefer-
ence is eliminated in an early distribution. Yet
even the most hardy souls seem to give up after
reaching the llth or 12th choicc and succumb to
the temptation of filling in thc remaining blanks
imphazardly. These latter votes, however. have
just as much value as the first ones, and it may
be your 17th vote that is responsible for putting
a candidate in office with a slim majority. Keep
this in mind when marking your ballot it may
save a lot of rcgrcts next year.

What Can You Lose?

Among othcr things in assembly this morning
will be discussion of a resolution, intrmiuccd Inst
wcck but tabled tlltc to luck of timc, calling for a
committee to investigati- our Voting systcm.

The main objection to this rctlucsl sci-ms to llt‘
that a similar cffot‘t was made last year in coluu‘c-
lion with constitution I'cvlsion, and furthrr work
along that line would only bc a rcprlilion. Limiting
ourselves to the scopc of ﬂu rcsolulion. lIl)Wt'\’t'|‘,
wc‘tl likc to point out that thcrc is a lot of confu-
sion among thc studcnts concerning various intru-
cacics of the incthod now in tow. \\'c arc not at.
tempting to cvnluutc tllc systcm itsr-If in any
way, but only its application Iu-rc.

Student Association will not be committing it-
self in any way by approving this l‘csultllhill. Noth—
ing will be lost, and a lot may be gaiucd. What how
you got to lose?

To the Editor:

As elections approach, we hear
many complaints on campus about
our voting procedure. The Mys-
kania lists are attacked on two
counts: there are too many candl-
dates, and much irrelevant data.
is given. The latter of these two
is mainly Myskania's fault — the
Constitution provides “Myskante
shall publish a list of the offices
held and the scholastic average at-
tained by each nominee.” Note the
word “offices”; that does not in-
clude two years' membership in a
required math course. The blame
for excessive nominating lies else-
where. This is also true of com-
plaints about other parts of the
election process. For example, our
counting system is now under at-
tack on the novel charge of being
too accurate.

Anyone who compares our elec-
tion process with that of any other
college will immediately be struck
by one thing—We are completely
unfettered and unrestricted, others
are not. Most colleges have strange
devices like nominating committees,
petition nominating, and plurality
elections. The first of these often
leads to the dictation of a slate, the
second to an elimination of inde—
pendent candidates, and third to all
sorts of tricks like “splitting” the
opposition’s vote. We are free to
nominate, campaign for, and vote
for whomsoever we please.

With this unlimited opportunity
goes unlimited responsibility. The
free system we use Is I. challenge
to us. Apparently some among us
have doubts. These doubts must
be answered by an intelligent use
of the free system We have evolved.
Let us not blame our own short-
comings on an election process
which merely records our own de—
sires. If we want Intelligent nom-
inating. campaigning, and voting,
then we must nominate, campaign,
and vote intelligently. During the
last two years the Student Associ-
ation and its Constitution Commis-
sion put the spotlight on the Con-
stitution and have freed elections
from all restraints of procedures
and mechanics. Now the spotlight
has moved. and it Is turned squarely
——on us.

To the Editor:

In regards to last week’s poll on
the budget. I would like to clear up
the following items of discussion:

1. The Pcdagoguc does not have
to submit a line budget because they
have only two expenses (printing
and photography) and two incomes
(space and advertising) lines. Be-
cause these lines are extremely
variable (depending on the number
of Seniors, extra activities, etc.) and
because there are so few of them. it

STATE COLLEGE NEWS.

ALICE PRINI)LE

 

 

Candidates State
Election Platforms

Because time run short last week
in Assembly the Student Body was
unable to hear the complete speech-
es of the candidates for President
of Student Association. Since this
is one of the most. important offices
in the college. the candidates have
submitted their speeches to the
NEWS so that the principle points
in each person’s platform may be
brought out.

Alice Prindle wishes to see great-
ly enlivened Assembly programs
next year at which current issues
would be intelligently discussed and
definite resolutions on them passed.
Five-Point Platform

Alice Williams has five points in
her platform: 1, the furthering of
a greater interest in current prob-
lcins; 2, a more genuine and wider
interest in student government; 3.
the furthering of a greater (:0—
operation with other colleges; 4, a
greater appreciation of State in the
community of Albany; 5. a main-
tonnncc of the friendly atmosphere
for which State has so long been
noted.

Worth Emphasizes Assembly

Eloise Worth particularly empha—
sizes the fact that Assembly pro-
grams should be reorganized in her
platform. She would like to see a
program planning committee made
up of rcprcscntatives from all col-
Icgc organizations. She feels this
will enable coverage of all student.
ilitcl'csis and eliminate duplication.
Silc cmphusizt-(I further that she
I'ccls that the .‘\le1 of the students
should be tllc will of the lender."
and that this is the motto under
which sllc would work.
