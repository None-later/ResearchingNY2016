Features Talks
On Student Lile

At the sixth annual conference
for the discussion of campus activi-
ties at Russell Sage last weekend,
at which Patricia de Rouvilie, '47,
Gerhard Weinberg, ’48, and Jean
Pulver, ’49, were present, discussions
were held on the newly-proposed
National Student Organization and
on various phases of campus life.

The conference opened Friday
evening, April 25, with a round table
discussion on the N80 Plans for the
new organization were introduced
to the delegates and a, later discus-
sion from the floor revealed that;
there was a general split in the opin—
ions of the colleges represented as
to the purposes, aims, and plans of
the organization.

The topic which aroused the most
interest was the advantages of the
honor system which has been adopt;—
ed by many colleges all over the
country. Students generally felt
that this system was very success-
ful to the point where students had
to report on each other, and where
some of the faculty were still hesi-
tant about completely accepting
the system. In most colleges, an
Honor Board is set up consisting of
a President and the presidents of
each of the group houses. The Board
is a secretive organization and the
identity of students who appear be—
fore the board is never revealed.

The delegates reported that in
general terms, the amount of pow-
er which any college has is in di—
rect proportion to the amount of
extra-curricular activities in which
the students participate,
