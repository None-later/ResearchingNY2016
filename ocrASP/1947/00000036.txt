Budget Blues . . .

For a group of supposedly intelligent and respon—
sible students, the assembly-goers at State exhibit
a remarkable atnount of rudeness.

Eating lunches and reading is bad enough, but
greeting budget items with hoots and whistles
marks a new low in misconduct. In the first place,
a great deal of time and thought has gone into this
budget. The people who draw it up receive no coin-
pensation for their efforts, and the attitude of Stu-
dent Association is nothing less than a kick in the
teeth for them. Fine compensation! Everyone who
contributed to last Friday‘s display is no doubt
very proud of himself-such people usually are.

We envy those who care so little about money
that they can afford to make a. joke out of more
than $20,000. Sincere questions are always we]-
comed; that is why we have a budget assembly.
But stupid queries that have no relation to the
subject under discussion and are obviously intended
to be funny are out of place in a serious meeting.

There are only two assemblies left this year. The
budget must be approved by the end of the month
if campus organizations are to continue function-
ing. Wasting this short time with unnecessary fool-
ing will profit no one.

It is time that a small group of students dropped
the attitude that officers of budget—supported
groups are trying to get next year's room and board
money out of Student Tax. If you have a legiti-
mate question, ask it; if not, don‘t waste the assent-
bly‘s time with pointless nonsense.

 

Memo on Rivalry . . .

\Yith Moving-Up Day only 24 hours away and
Rivalry almost at an end, we'd like to devote some
space to a. memo for the freshman and Sophomore
classes.

The Sophs know, and the frosh have no doubt
heard, that tomorrow’s activities attract a great
many parents aml guests to the school. 'I‘hcse out-
siders who come to watch our traditional ceremonies
will carry away a dcfinitc impression of State. Will
it be good or bad?

That, obviously, dcpcuds on our conduct.
throughout the day. If things continue to go on
as they have for the past few years, State's rcputa~
tion will sui'fcr a serious setback. l’arcnts do not
enjoy watching the rival classes crawling along the
sidewalk and fighting ovcr bits of ribbon or bcauics.
It is, to say thc lcasl, a disgusting display of child—
ishncss and lack of dignity.

This year both classes have promiscd to forget
about the "rough stuff” on Moving-Up Ilay. it’s
safe to say that most mcmbcrs of the classes in
question will stand by thcir plcdgc. It will only
take a few people, ltmvcvcr, to spoil everything.

A few unfortuluuo incidents last fall proved that
it does not take many "non-conformists” to thwart
the best of plans. Since that timc the conduct of
rivalry has been very good, with little cause for
complaint.

This is a request to both ilic Sophomores and
ircslnncn: confine your activities to official com-
petition tomorrow and forget. about the. rest.

Our round of the cmnpuscs bc-

A Word of (‘onsoiiltlon

As exams approach an [.00 quick-
ly We find this note of consolation
in tho (diutnpittiher of Champlain
College.

"For those wno consistuntly
flunk math there. is the. record of
’l‘homus Edison whoso highest. math
mark hovered around tho upper
forties."

April 20 murkr 'i the tree planting
ceremony over at Russell Sago. Tree

guardians were appointed, and the
first, step toward replacing the trees
which have had to be removed was
taken.

In Potsdam plans are underway
for the second public world per-
formance of Patti Hiudemilh's "Re-
quiem". The Crime mixed chorus
under the direction of Robert Shaw,
renowned American conductor, will
present. the number during its an-
nual Spring Music festival on May

CONTRARY TO THE STATE COLLEGE NEWS

Contrary to the State College NEWS. the open
meeting of the committee investigating a new voting
procedure will not meet in Room 2, but rather in
some room not yet determined.

The fact that the student body voted for the ap-
pointment of the committee is a. good sign. Much of
the discussion in Assembly last Week was not relevant
to the proposal. As was pointed out by the proposer,
this committee will only determine whether or not
some other system or systems are superior to the
one now in use. For people actually understand it,
and this meeting will clear up a lot of obscure points.

Everyone, with or without a better system of his
own should attend these hearings. It's interesting to
note that we have graduated to the point where
work is done in committee and not before a lethargic
student body.

A reminder. It would be a good idea for all possible
to bring the NEWS issue of April 18 to Assembly
next week. Also last week's. Tito first has the budget
outline which is convenient to refer to during dts-
cussion. Last. week's issue has the three possible plans
for financing the Student Activities Center.

0 Now for those vultures who plowed through
the above and are waiting for the predictions for
Myskania.

We wish to make it clear that the following is mere
1y guesswork. We have no official information. The
only scientific angle used was the formula:

Quota equals number votes cast (948) divided by lines
per ballot multiplied by number of volumes on third
shelf front in library plus the mtmbcr of faculty ment-
bers. A full exploitation of this formula can be found
in the 800 pages report filed with the janitorial staff.
We defy the student body to profcr a. better, more
efficient system.

Since we have been hiix‘rnating in the PO for most.
of the year, the other candidates for Miscellaneous

four additional members will come from the follow-
ing names: Kisiel, Rochl‘ord, Shapiro, Williams, Cole-

Tomorrow, Tomorrow and Tomorrow

Tomorrow ’47 outwardly breaks
its tie with State. There’s nothing
left but final exams, and it’s possi-
ble that we speak for quite a few
of y’all when we say we hope to
heaven it will be final. As a fresh-
man, moving-up day was very dis-
tant and far away; as a soph it
meant drinking out of the rivalry
cup at the 119—111 passing we'd like
to mention the name of George Hess,
one of our number who won’t be
here this moving-up day —— as a
junior, it was still in the futurem
not close enough for any pangs of
anticipation—but, now it's here——
a step toward the oblivion which
beckons to every class before its
moving-up and out. it‘s been a class
story well written: the mark of '47
leaves a definite imprint on State
College, and you know what. I mean.
Keeping It Clean

It's quite obvious that. fraterni—
ties are back to stay. This is good.
One thing that can’t be stopped too
quickly is participation in sports to
increase fraternity prestige as a po-
litical machine. This is bad. In
spite of severe criticism from the
left wing we have made every possi—
ble attempt to keep fraternity poli-
tics and loyalties out of the sports
pages. It; is our policy to give proper
recognition to outstanding athletic
events. To date to the best of our
ability, sports reporting has been
kept clean. We sincerely hope that
particlpitation will be on the same
basis.

Orchids

Congratulations to Edna Sweeney
and Bill Marsland for doing a swell
job as respective heads of WAA and
WA. The foundation is strong let‘s
hope ’48 can build on it.

And now the time has comegvlike
the rain, it. comes, but it. has to
stop.

WAA Bowling
Won By Farrell

W.A.A. bowling drew to a close
this week with Farrell House cup-
turing the top pluce.

scheduled wore played off, Farrell

losing as many games as any other
team, although they did not win
any more Limit (lamina Kappa Phi

Remember the good old song
of our free. pre State College,
happy, pre Sports Staff, child-
hood days? It started out some-
thing like this: Old McDonald
had a farm—and then after this
'themical introduction a whole
mess of ei-el and 0’s wore
thrown in. The rest consisted of
an enumeration of the animarlan
pursuits of this garcon McDon-
aid.

So what's this to do with

doing a little Archie Gardiner job
