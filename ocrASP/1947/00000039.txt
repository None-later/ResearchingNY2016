ALBANY. NEW YORK. FRIDAY, SEPT. 19. 1947

 

Frosh Flll Lower Draper
In Old Erin’s Green

Wearing of The Green. Erin Go
Bragh and Hall to The Loyal Sotis
of Ireland!

With spirited enthusiasm the
Class of '51 takes over the colors of
the Class of ‘47. Brandishing their
bright green "little boy caps" and
ribbons, the frosli, although sortie-
what confused and dazed. are mak-
ing their mark on the State College
campus.

Gayer than the emblems of last
year's freshman class. these new
spots of color mark the wearer be-
yond question and gives cause to
varied comments from upperclass—
men. From the sneering sophomores
they hear, “just wait"; the ever-
loving Juniors promise. "We‘re be—
hind yotl" and the long—suffering
Seniors say: “Go to it. kids."

For the first time the freshmen
are wearing an Eaton style cap. and
it is the popular opinion that this
change from beanies is nutch for
the better.

It‘s a great tradition and the
green-decked ft‘osh are doing their
part in upholding it.
