Increased Enrollment

Necessitetes benge

During the summer the three
modern foreign language depart-
ments, German, French. and Span-
ish, Were combined into one depart-
ment with Dr. J. Wesley Childers as
its head. The new department of
modern foreign languages has 10
instructors and a total registration
of 1034 students.

The purpose of this department,
according to Doctor Childers, is to
provide a more flexible program so
that an increased enrollment in any
one of the three languages can be
taken care of. The instructors of
the department can be assigned to
classes of any one of the three
languages. This will make for ease
in scheduling classes and will allow
the instructors to be put where they
are most needed.

The teaching personnel, includ-
ing Doctor Childers are:

Dr. Edward P. Shaw,
of Romance Languages.

Dr. Marion E. Smith, Assistant
Professor of French.

Dr. Annette Dobbin, Assistant
Professor of French.

Dr. Stewart Denslow, Assistant

BERYI. DAVIS'S NEW DISC FOR RCA VICTOR

* It’s a groovy group of notes—done to a tum by one of the
top of the new crop of singers.

Yes, Beryl Davis knows how to pick a tune . . . knows how
to pick a cigarette too. “I tried many different brands and
compared,” says Beryl Davis—“I found Camels suit me best.”

That’s how millions learned from experience that there
are big differences in cigarette quality. Try Camels in your
“T-Zone" (Taste and Throat). Let your own experience
tell you why more people are smoking Camels

Coed Rifle Club

Starts Practice

On Wednesday, September 24th,
the sharpshooters of State College
met for the first time to discuss
ways and means for the first Co-Ed
rifle club on this campus.

More than twenty people have
expressed an interest in the activity,
although disappointment was ex-
pressed ut the relatively small
turnout of sight, at the first meet-
ing.

Co‘Ed Competition

Those already working on the
project hope to have a competing
team of six men and four women in
the field by the start of the second
semester. This team would partl-
cipate in shoots with other colleges
under the affiliation of the National
Rifle Association.

High hopes are being held for a
time when the club will own five
or six rifles themselves. At present
llOWCVEI‘, the club members will
have to use their own guns. The
present members also hold a far-
ofl vision of the time when beneath
a new gym, State might have a fine
rifle range.

Practice Next Week

Until that time the club can be
found, starting Saturday, the 4th
of October. on the New York Con-
trol rang-o, twenty-seven cents
worth, outside of town. Those in-
torcslod will find the fun starts at
one. in the afternoon.

Provisional president, Lew Sum—
bci'g extends n welcome to all in-
toroslcd and it is to be understood
that everyone is welcome. Even if
you know nothing at all about how
in hold or illlll a rifle. the more
informed members will be ready
with guidance.

WAA Council
Holds Meeting

The Frosh Piayday, sponsored by
WAA, is scheduled for October
fourth. Mickey Seaman, 49, gen-
eral chairman, states that the ac-
tivities will take place on the dorm
field between the Pierce and Sayies
Halls. .

The refreshment committee, so
vital to every project is in compe-
tent hands, namely, Pat Tilden 48,
and Lucy Lytle, ’49. Jpanita Evans,
and Bev. Sittig, Juniors, are in
charge of entertainment and games,
respectively, while Ruth Mattescn
and Elly Adams share honors on
the clean-up committe. It promises
to be a hilarious and invigorating
day, freshmen, so let's see you
there.

WAA Store
A store, mainly for Freshmen, is

“being opened by WAA, shortly, to

deal in sneaks, tennis balls and
rackets, ping pong balls, etc. As
there is always a demand for ath~
lctic equipment during the begin-
ning of the year, this store, below
Conch Hathaway‘s office, will be
open one period every day for the
ﬁrst few weeks. Watch the WAA
bulletin board for the exact date
and the periods it will be open.
Fencing, Soccer, Tennis

Here’s a chance for all those
really interested in fencing. Mickey
Seaman, '49, is going to start prac-
tice soon in order to etnch the pre-
liminary tactics before the instruc-
tor comes during the winter. This
will savo u lot of valuable time and
enable the particinants to learn
more.

Because of the demand for soc-
cerball, it will now be played every
Tuesday and Thursday afternoon
from 3:30 lo 5:30. Joanne Joslin,
49, and Shirley McCuen, 50, are
planning a tennic tournament to
start immediately. General prac-
lice is held on the Washington Park
