New Plan To Alter School Crisis—,-
Name Bulger Head Oi Program

"Our country has progressed and
prospcrcd in direct ratio to the
growth and strength of our Ameri-
can educational system.’

Recognize that quote, sliidcnts of
New York State College for Touch-
crs. Iii cnsc you don't. the words
are Now of President 'l‘lllllidll; the
issue is one of major impc'tnncc to
each college student, each person
dirccily or indirectly connected with
the Leaching profession, and cs-
pccinlly to each prospccllvc teacher.

"No businessman in tho United
States can afford to ignore the
dangerous possibilities uhcud if the
)‘l‘cscllt crisis in our schools is not
incl and solved."

Ccriulnly we have all known of
thc crisis; our interest has been
diuwn by 1111 aspects of the prob-
lclli. lliu just what has been done
about it?

On Scpiciiibcr 2, 1047. a new pro-
gram was begun at Slain to help
solve some of the pioblcms con-
fronting ilic cducuiioiud systems
of the immediate area and of the
state as n whole. In charge of the
plan in. our college is Mr Paul C.
Bulger. Coordinator or Field Serv-
ices and Public Relations. This
service has now been added to the
programs of tile ten other ieuchers'
colleges in New York State, making
New York one of the leading states
in the venture. Dr. Hermann Cooper.
assistant coiuiiiissioncr in charge of
teachers. ‘

Education, State Education Dc-
purtncnt. was responsible for the
birth of the idea; having presented
his plan through contacting col-
lege prcsidcnts. a legislative act iii-
scricd the item in the budget of
New York‘s State Colleges for
’I‘cnchcrs. Thus we have been for-
tunntc enough to gct a start. —— and
u good start w toward n plan which
will be for our mutual benefit; a
plan which has as its aims an im-
provement in tcuchcr education;
the improvement of teachers ul-
rcndy in service; an offering of aid
to school systems of the state, with
spcciul intention lo the administra-
tion mid admission programs,

In conncction with the statewide
program, Mr. Bulgci' has been plac-
ed on the Joint Committee on Pub—
lic Relations of the American As-
sociation of ’l‘cuchcrs' Collcg‘es,
which further emphasizes the ex-
tent to which this is a (no-operative.
rather than an individual under-
taking. The whole program calls
for co-operution; this means not
only in reference to other colleges,
but to the individual student. For
instance, each member of Student
Assoeiatiou serves as an advertising
agent for the college; each must
ucccpt as his own personal respon-
sibility the furthering of public re-
lations; it must be made clear that
this is both a faculty and a student
job. '

To-morrow Night

Giants to Tour Europe
Alter U. 5. Concerts

The Original Don Cossack Chorus
and Dancers, under the direction 01'
Serge Jaroff, will appear at Page
Hall tomorrow night at 8:30 P. M.,
under the sponsorship of Music
Council.

Following their campaign through
the United States, the Don Cossacks
will drive on to Europe in the
spring, their first unsupported ac-
tion on the Continent in 9 years.
Their last appearance was under
USO auspices, during which they
entertained 95.000 GI’s stationed in
England, France, Holland, Belgium,
and Germany.

Travel 700,000 Miles

According to the National Con-
cert and Artists Corporation, they
know as much about America’s
“Purple mornitain majesty" and
“fruited plains" as National Geo-
graphic, plus many things that
magazine does not report. In 1930.
the chorus of Muscovite giants ex-
changed the traditional steed of the
Steppes for train and bus and have
since covered over 700,000 miles
from Tallahassee to Vancouver. ,

The Artists Corporation added
that by the time World War II
forced them onto trains, they learn-
ed the first name of every hot-dog
stand owner west of the MiSsissippi;
were the favorites of hotel clerks
everywhere and had traded recipes
with bartenders at oases from the
Atlantic to the Pacific.

Hold Inspection

Many stories have been released
about Serge Jaroff, director of the
Don Cossacks. It is said that be-
forc every performance Jaroff holds
full inspection. The singers might
be fined anywhere from $1 for un-
shincd boots or a creased tunic to
$25 for liquor-breath. If a man is
late for a concert. he stands to lose
$25. If he is absent without cause,
he parts with $50.

However, in 27 years no man has
ever received a major fine. Jaroff's
favorite pastime on tour is the way
they account for their exemplary
behavior. Their lender loves to play
gin-ruinmy; and he loves to win.
Whenever he does, reports claim,
the concert that night excels the
previous one. His choristers prefer
losing to him in gin-rummy to get-
ting fined. “More fun; costs less,"
they say with Cossack brevity.

Mr. Jaroff would like to organize
a similar troupe with United States
Army soldiers and exchange con-
certs with the best choruses in Eu-
rope. Thc choristers are looking
forward to the United States Army
singing in Moscow's Bolshoi The-
atre while the Red Army Chorus
sings at Radio City Music Hall.
