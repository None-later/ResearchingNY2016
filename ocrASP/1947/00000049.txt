Dr. Shields McIiwaine, Professor
of English, will represent the
Rhodes Scholarships this year for
State College. Each year, according

thirty-two scholarships are awarded
to the United States from the Uni-
versity of Oxford. Dr. McIlwaine
will take charge of application
blanks and information on how to
apply for the scholarship. at this
institution.

Previous to this, thirty-two schol-
arships have been available. How-
ever, in view of the fact that stu-
dents were prevented from apply-
ing during the war years, sixteen
additional scholarships will be
awarded this year. These forty-
elght appointments will be divided
between candidates for regular or
War Service Scholarships, at the
discretion of the Committee of
Selection in accordance with the
merits of applicants. At this time,
the scholarship is for two years
with a value of 500 pounds. Stu-
dents who can maintain a scholar-
ship rating at Oxford will be
awarded a third year.

Candidates eligible for a scholar-
ship must be single male citizens of
the United States and between the
ages of nineteen and twenty-five on
October 1, 1948. They must also
have completed at least the Sopho-
more year by the time of applica-
tion. Those candidates who come
under the War Service Scholarship
need only have completed one year
of college work and may be thirty-
three years of age on October 1,
1948. They must have one year of
war service or war work for which
Draft Boards have granted defer-
ment. These men will not find
marriage a bar.

Applications must be in by the
end of October, 1947. Scholars se-
lected will enter the University of

TeocherColleges

Cathrine Donnelly,‘ ’49. elected

last spring to the Board of Con-.

trol of the Eastern States Associa-
tion of Professional Schools for
Teachers, to represent all students
of New York State Teacher's Coi-
leges, and Gerhard Weinberg, '48,
student representative-at-large from
New York State, will attend the first
board meeting to be held October

York City.

It will be a one-day meeting to
plan the entire association meeting
next March. at which time all cam-
pus problems brought up will be dis-
cussed by the representative facility
members and students.

The Eastern States Association of
Professional Schools for Teachers, a
faculty-student group designed to
improve curriculum methods and
other worth-while projects, formed
this Board of Control composed of
one student and one faculty mem-
bre of each participating state.

Formerly. this Association was
composed solely of faculty members,
but it is now endeavoring to gain
student members. Dr. Harvey Rice,
formerly of Albany State Teachers
College faculty and now President
of Oswego State Teachers College,
is the {faculty representative for
New York State. He was asked to
have the students of Albany state
Teachers College elect a student
representative for all State Teachers
Colleges in New York.

cation blanks for absentee ballots

Men To Elect New Officers

For St. Mary’s

At election to be held October 17
at State College the men who live
at St. Mary’s will elect two counsel-
ors from each barrack and a gen-
eral chairman. Due to the lack of
any resemblance of organization at
the St. Mary's project, Myskania
has been asked to conduct the elec-
tion proceedings.

The general picture at St. Mary's
now is one of disorganization. The
responsibility for the proper func-
tioning of the project is left almost
entirely to one small committee,
composed of a few of the St. Mary’s
men, whose duties are manifold.
The chairman of this committee
must act as houscmothcr. clean-up
committee and general overseer all
rolled into one.

Rents are paid into a regular
agency which furnishes some sort
of janutoriai service. but, in case
of an emergency. the situation
would call for some immediate ac-
tion by the St. Mary's man them-
selves. To meet such an emergency
and to prevent cvcyday problems
from reaching major proportions

Housing Project

 

some form of organization is need-
ed.

It is difficult to even begin to
organize the group because since
the men do not cut at St. Mary's,
there is no actual way of getting
them all together at the same time.
For this reason the coming election
will be held at the college. Where
all the men will have a chance to
vote for the chairman and counsel-

l'if.

Dr. Ralph Baker, head of the
housing committee has been mak-
ing every effort to make the group
into one well-organized unit that
will be able to meet the new prob-
lems that arise and to solve them.
The present system at St. Mary's
is not adequate. It is hoped that
once the now chuirmim and coun-
selors are elected they can work
as 21 group that will provide for the
proper functioning of the St. Mary’s
project. The responsibility for how
the project functions will then rest
entirely in the hands of the men
and the representatives they have
elected.

Students To Nominate
Campus Queen Today

 

Freel, Tucker
Represent State
At Conference

Robert Tucker and Bernadette
Freel, Sophomores, were delegates
to a Red Cross Conference, held
last weekend at the College of New
Rochelle. at which 35 colleges were
represented.

The primary purpose of the con-
ference was to interest students in
all colleges in organizing college
units of the American Red Cross.

The following suggestions may be
considered by the students of State
College in planning. with chapter
assistance, their college unit:
Service to Camps and Hospitals

Help is needed in veteran's hos-
pitals, army camps, navy installa-
tions and hospitals. In the near
future, Albany will have one of the
largest veteran's hospitals in the
state. Students can arrange ward
parties and musical or dramatic
presentations such as the Big-8.
Men are needed for the compan—
ionship of men—to share their hob-
bies. to be instructors. and to ar-
range outings.

Service to Veterans on Campus

Veteran‘s wives may enroll in
homemaking courses, nutrition
courses, and learn of facilities for
child care and guidance. By offer-
ing these opportunities, the college
unit could help to curb the veteran's
expenses.

Home Nursing and First Aid

In the home nursing course. there
will be a chance to practice simple
nursing skills, to learn when to put
the patient to bed, how to make
him comfortable. and how to give
simple treatment ordered by the
doctor.

Water Safety

There is an opportunity for train-
ing for leadership at a camp or
at a pool as a water safety instruc-
tor.

A concge unit requires a board of
if) members, including a Chairman.
Vice-Chairman and a Secretary-
Trcasurcr, and the active partici-
pation and co-opcrntion of the stu-
dent body.

 

Coleman To interview Tryouts

Ritn Coleman, ‘48, Advertising
Manager of the State College News
has requested that all Juniors and
Sophomores interested in working
on the advertising staff contact
her ilnmcdinteiy.

ties." Beverly Bistoff, ‘48, Director
