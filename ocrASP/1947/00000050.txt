Stunted Growth

For some time now, State has tried to extend
its fame beyond these hallowed halls and make the
rest of the collegiate world know that State really
exists.

So far nothing spectacular has brought atten-
tion beating its way to Draper Hall. The News
is but a small echo for it never goes much beyond
the newspaper staffs of other schools. Music Coun-
cil and the dramatic groups on campus help some
towards spreading the good word about State
around this area but even these reach out to en-
compass a rather small radius. Debate Council,
IGC, the religious clubs and athletics, to some ex-
tent, carry on intercollegiate activities, but there is
still much to be done.

Finally, realizing the need for something big on
the State College campus, Inter-Sorority and l'n~
ter-Fraternity Councils put their heads together
and out came the idea for a big all-State Ball. A
name band publicized throughout the area would
put State before the public eye. But the public eye
has been closed.

According to the latest reports, no bids will be
sold outside of State College. Most. recent reports
from the high office state that except under special
circumstances, one half of each couple must be
from State. This buddy, buddy atmosphere may be
very cozy, but a few outsiders would do much
to add to the prestige of State.

We realize that we have a high academic rating,
and its nice to be known as an institution of
“brains”, but we’re almost sure that it wasn’t the
geniuses graduated from Notre Dame that put
that college on the map.

A high scholastic rating is very admirable but
a little prestige from the other side of college
life might do much towards classifying us as “all-
round” teachers. .An opportunity has presented it—
self for State to gain a little recognition from other
circles and as usual, the opportunity has been
squelched.

Is it the danger of outsiders corrupting our mor-
als, that brings this ruling? If so, why allow us to
tread outside these sacred halls at all? Why not
invite a few outsiders to the iiall and introduce
State to the cold, cruel world. We must meet this
great obstacle sometime. Are we hiding from some-
thing?

Please, Fellows

As long as we’re on the topic of the Inter—Sorori-
ty, Inter-Fraternity Ball, we might just as well
devote the whole of the editorial column to the
issue.

We’ve all heard the statement that State has
never done anything and done it right. State goes
all out for the Bali, and then it is announced that
the affair will be semi-formal.

The fellows complain about the expense, but
I’m sure that when some of the girls invite a fellow
from home and bear the expense, their expense will
be as great if not greater than that of the fellows.

Come on, fellows, give us a break and go all the
way just this once.

The Gospel According To St.
Student

1. Then up spoke Archaic, he of
the lost Paradise. and saith to his
son Erudite, the academic one; yea
verily, it is time that thou enterest
the Kingdom of Lost Souls.

2. Do thou go by the waters of
the Hudson to the Temple; it
standeth by the Western pathway,
and is encompassed about by many
strange and wonderful places.

3. Beyond Mount Sign-out lieth
the fair fields of Washington Park.
Wherefore slttest thou down in the
ninth and tenth months, which are
the months of Registration and fad-
ing tans, and count unto thyself
thy many blessings of Baby Parties
and fair smiles upon the faces of
sorority women.

4. Let not the Pharisees, they of
the uppcrelasses. lead thee into
temptation, which is at the place of
Octavius, the Olendorfian one,
where there is much imbibing of
the Juice of the grape, yea beerily.

5. Nay, stay not there, but arise,
my love, and come away to the
blessed hall of the Son of Richard;
let thy soul rejoice in the frag-
rance which cometh forth from the
multitudes, who have not long since
partaken of loaves and fishes in the
Tomb of Cafeteria. as these same
multitudes press upward to the

 

INESON

Twentieth Room,

6. Descend from there into the
Valley of the Commons. at which
shrine are gathered two or three
hundred in the Name of the Mail-
boxes. Call to thy remembrance
that this the spot where the great
white gods of Campus Commission
did, in their rage and fury, battle
mightin with the Green-Robed
Ones, they that are of the tribe of
freshmen, and did slay many with
barbed warnings from the War
Council of the Sons and Daughters
of Myskania.

7. Turn again from the fair coun-
tenances of thy professors, which
are plentiful as olives in Mount
Martini, and enter the temple of
the money—changers, which shall
henceforth be known to all men as
the Boul. In this vale of tears thou
must forsake all others and, for
forty minutes and forty cents,
cleave unto the Fried Single Over.

8. There abldeth with thee always
cuts, warnings. and assemblies;
and of these. the most important is
assembly. If a student maketh
straight A and hath not attendance
at assembly. it avalieth him noth-
ing, and upon his roommate, and
upon his roommatc's roommates
shall be visited the expulsion by the
dean.

To the Editor:

Last Friday Mr. Abrams. repre--
senting Myskania, read an an-
nouncement of the decision reach-
ed after the public hearing held for
Paul Kirsch. ‘51. The nature of
the statement was definitely in-
sulting and derogatory, as evidenced
by the reaction of the audience to
the statement. Myskania. as the
judicial body of Student Associa-
tion, has the right to render deci-
sions in scholastic affairs. How-
ever, they do not have the right to
publicly insult or deride any man
no matter what. the charges against
him.

I am wholly aware of the nature
of the case and the attendant. cir-
cumstances at the hearing before
Myskania. Nevertheless. I feel that
Myskania has over-stepped itself in
assuming it has the right to pub-
licly shame any individual.

The decision (it Myskania was not
tlull of a legal body. Rather, it
sounded like a note. of revenge. The
actions of Myskania are serious
enough for consideration of im-
peachment charges. Insttlting any
man publicly is not in the legal
code. of conduct for Myskania.

if the statement. is not retracted
and an apoiigy rendered to the
party concerned, 1 shall be forced
to present impeachment charges to
the Strident. Association for the
failure of Myaknnia to conduct ii.-
aell’ in a manner befitting its posi—
tion in the college hierarchy.

By EUGENE McLAREN

The Common-Stator is given the widest latitude as
author of this column, although his viewpoints do
not necessarily reflect those of the Sum COLLEGE
News.

 

We had intended, since this is a new column, to
start off with a statement of policy and let our read—
ers have an idea of what to expect in the future. We
have, however, decided not to commit ourselves, but
rather to take advantage of the “widest latitude" of-
fered us, and to write about anything we feel may
be of interest to the students of State. While we will
do our best to bring out all news, we must admit
we have no spies around school, and will welcome
facts and suggestions from all.

We will be satisfied if the readers think of this
column what we say of the previous one; that, while
not necessarily always agreeing with it, that column
was one of the first things we always turned to each
Friday when we picked up a NEWS.

Biggest news this week concerns the proposed All-
state Christmas Semi-Formal. Financial trouble has
popped up to give the committee a collective head-
ache early this week. The story behind this follows.

Plans and ground work for this dance have been
drawn up by a combined committee representing In-
ter-Sorority and Inter-Fraternity Councils, on the
assumption that no expense would be encountered
before the sale of bids commenced. However, it was
found a couple of days ago that in order to secure
the services of the band agreed upon as the best
available at the price which could be paid,. Claude
Thornhill and his orchestra, a down payment of 5094,
$900 in this case, would necessary. Since the coun-
cll treasuriCs do not have that kind of money, before
the sale of tickets commences, this committee may
have to turn to Student Association for help. We
say "may" because it is possible that the organiza-
tions involved may be able to raise the money them-
selves.

Since this dance was originally planned for the.
whole school, one idea being that it would add to the
prestige of the college. and since a lot of work has
gone into its planning so that it would be sound fl-
nanclally and at the same time assure a good time
for those attending, we feel the students should stip-
port the motion if it is brought tip and in any case
the dance. Approval has already been obtained from
Student Council to introduce the financial motion.
There will be more on this. next week.

As far as the proposed Insurance Plan, we illl(i('l'-
stand that the whole business is to be narrowed down
by the elimination, because of an administration rul—
ing, of any locally administered plan. Our informa—
tion is that the present infirmary fund will be al-
lowed to continue, for the present, at least, simul-
taneously with the new plan, if approved. The infirm-
ary fund benefits, in view of past surpluses, may be
increased by a small amount, with no increase in
cost to the student. Any general expansion of the
plan, however, will not be permitted by the admin--
lstratlon.

As we see it, in view of the general agreement. which
has prevailed that some type of security be offered
to the students, with discussion being merely as to
the best method of obtaining maximum coverage

_ for minimum cost, this apparently leztvcs little choice.

In spite of the poll taken this week which un-
covered the surprising fnct that nearly 50% of the
representative group polled were covered by other
policies, in view of the committee‘s report, We. don't
believe these policies can be comparable to lhe one
offered to us as a group in coverage or cost. There-
fore, although we are on record as having opp0scd
this plan, we now see no alternative except to vote
for it, and by it. We'll undoubtedly use it. too. if the
football season lasts much longer.

A complaint was registered to Student Council Wod-
nesday night that fifth year students are not allowed
to speak at. Student Association Meetings. This is be-
cause it. has been ruled that, even though they pur—
chase Student Tax tickets, as griuluutes they are not.
active members of the association, but. are not merely
allowed to enjoy some of the privileges. The present
understanding, that a Grad can speak only when per-
mission is granted by a resolution introduced by an
undergradmtte. seems rather unwieldy and quite silly.
There should be some action on this soon.

in closing, we do hope that Albanians passing the
front. of Page Hall realize that. most State College stu-
dents do NO’l‘ bring their own lunch.

Blood on the sidewalk,

Blood on the ground,

And bloody football players
all (trottnd.

Pity the ref bloody and dead,

Where the great big athletes
stamped on his head.

It's almost too late this year to
do anything about the football field
but let’s keep it in mind for the
future. Let's try to preserve State's
manhood as long as possible. Any-
one witnessing the close calls this
week will readily agree that the
present set—up leaves much to be
desired. ~-—~M«

While on the subject of football
a neat bit of sportsmanship was
displayed on the field recently. The
wnistle blcw just as one squad was
coming out of the huddle. A mem—
ber of the dei‘cnsiw team called
“let ’em have one more play." The
play fez-tilted in a touchdown. Foot—
ball would be a lot more enjoyable
for both players and spectators if
more of this type of sportsmanship
were displayed rather than the
type which has more often been
noted since the season began.

 

WAA has organized a Riding
Club and is scheduled for Satur-
day morning. Thc initial outlay

is $1.50 per ride but WAA will re—
fund half the price at the end of
10 rides. Sounds like a good deal
for anyone who wants to master a
style of riding. The horses need
exercise so let's give 'em a break.

Remember 1. h a t sensational
hockey game last Friday, well here‘s
the financial result. The grandee
total was $45. The fellows from St.
Mary's would like to express their
sincere gratitude and thanks to all
their supporters and especially to
the WAA team for their bravery
in the face of danger. We would
like to mention here that all the
danger was not faced by the coeds;
the Saints also had much to cope
with after the girls decided “every-
thing goes."

The $45 will be divided between
the three lounges and even if the
bottom dropped out of the market
overnight this amount would only
furnish a few lamps and ash trays.
We urge St. Mary's to sponsor a
few more of these events both to
line their own pockets and also for
general enjoyment.

Outing Club S—ponsors
Hike, RPI Speaker

On Sunday. October 19th. at a
quarter of nine. the RM Outing
Club will sponsor a mountain
climbing expedition to Mt. Cilnscen-
bury near Benningion, Vermont.

The cost of the trip will be ap-
proximately $150 and all those in—
terested are to meet in front of
Pierce Hall.

This is one of the first. of a series
of outings to bl- backed by the RPI
organization, and on Tuesday even-
ing at 7:30 a representalive from
Troy will be here to encourage ne-
liVe participation from State and
explain the acllvllies and advant—
ages. in a l‘t‘f"‘t‘tll.i()lllli way. of this
plan.

Bowlers Enter
Collegiate League

On Wednesday. October 15th, a
team of State-men took to the al-
leys in the return of Inter-Collegi-

ate Bowling to State College. In a
newly formed league, six teams

competed at the Playdlum.

This new league is under the
sanction of the American Bowling
Congress and consists of teams
from: Albany Business College, Al-
bany Pharmacy. Law School, Sicna,
RPI and State. All six teams will
compete every Wednesday night at
9 p. m. on alleys 1-6; and a cheer-
ing section from State would be
welcome.

Motion To lie Introduced Today

As yet. Lin-re. is no MAA line to
take care of the expenses of a
bowling team, therefore the fee for
this week's match will be taken
care of by the petty cash fund.
However, a motion will be made in
Assembly today for an appropria-
tion of $150. from the surplus for
the purpose of supporting a Var-
sity Bowling team. The money is
needed for the following purposes:
a sanctioning fee. to the American
Bowling Comm. of $.50: the bowling
fee of $4.50; a team tip of $.50; and
$1.25 per game toward the end of
the season banquet and awards.
With a season of twenty weeks
planned, to last. from this post
Wednesday until Easier, with the
exception of December 24th and
31st. this will run into a budget of
more than $135.00.

Seven lllgh Men to Bowl

The team which bowled for State.
this week was composed of those
state-men who had the highest av—
erage in last. season‘s Intro-mural
Bowling. As soon as the Intra-
mural scason gets going this year
trials will be held for any member
of MAA who is interested. From
then, the seven men with the high-
csi cumulative scores will bowl that
week. .

two touchdouuis came in the fourth
period, both on passes from lrlort-
nick lo Schick.

in u fret- scoring contest, the
iiluublers won their first. game at
the expensf ol‘ Villli’lt‘t‘, iii-M. The
game was close all the way with
t‘at'i' ll'ulll having many opportu—
nities to score.

Will Justice Triumph?

The current squabble over the
eligibility of an inter-collegiate
athlete brings to the fore the yearly f
rhubarb over the amateur status of 
the big-time college footballer. Just i
as regularly as the football seasoni
rolls around, the old “amateur-or-i
pro” question pops up. i

We refer to the case of Charlie
Justice, ace half-back of the U. of 
North Carolina. It seems that
“Choo-Choo", as Justice is known:
in football circles, signed a. pro}
football contract while in the Navy. 
Now along comes the lawyer of a:
U. of Richmond player who had?-
been suspended from the football;
squad because as a boy of fifteen 3
he had signed a pro baseball con- 7
tract. Said attorney, "if my John-
ny is suspended, then your "Choo-
Choo" should also be given the
heave-ho." All well and good. But -‘
let‘s look at the whole football pic-
ture.

to get reservations for wagon space.
These will be on sale in the Com-
mons. The nominal fee of seventy-
five cents will admit a couple to
the hayride and to the dance which
will follow. Ditllce tickets will be
thirty-flVe cents.

The group will leave Pierce Hall
at seven-thirty sharp. All those
planning to attend are asked to
“pieezc” be on time as late comers
are liable to miss the attraction.

College football players of the
present day are no more amateurs
than Joe Dlmag or Joe Louis or
Sid Luckman. They are well paid
for their services whether it’s in
the form of free tuition or the fat
check the Alumni slips Johnny
Touchdown for his “expenses.”
Johnny is well fed, well housed and
well taken care of. No less an au-
thority than Patti Gallico, ace
Sports Editor for twenty years, says
of college footballers; "Amateurs

. there ain't none." Gallico calls
the false "amateur pretenses put
up by the big-time colleges "the last
stronghold of hypocrisy."

No Justice?

Don’t get us wrong. We're all for
better college football and better
breaks for the college players. But
we just can’t see why the name
colleges continue to kid the public
along by making a big issue of a
player's eligibility every so often.
For if “Choo-Choo" is suspended
you can rest assured that there
just ain’t no JUSTICE.
