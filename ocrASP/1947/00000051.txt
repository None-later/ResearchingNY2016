Council To Schedule
St. Mary's Elections

Certain groups on campus mis-
interpreted the articie concerning
the St. Mary’s Housing Project
printed in last week's News.

Previous to the fall semester, a.
temporary council was appointed
by the Men's Housing Committee.
George Poulos is Chairman of the
Council, which consists of Walter
Schick, Charles Frail, Francis An-

~dreone, and Peter Taiorico. Three

vacancies were filled on a tempor-
ary basis by Lincoln Marzeilo, Mor-
ris Gerber, and Alton Millen.

The temporary council has effi-
ciently handled the problems in-
volved in the preliminary organi-
zation of the dormitory, and it is
disorganized only in that the coun-
cil is not student-elected. Accord-
ing to Dean Stokes, the election of
a permanent council will be held
this week at St. Mary's, under the
supervision of Myskania.

Students Nominate Queen

preceding count. At the present
time, it is referred back to the first
count.

4. Sample ballots of the coming
election should be posted three days
in advance on Myskania. D&A, and
Draper bulletin boards.

5. The elections should be moved
out of Page into the Commons. This
will be tried Monday when fresh-
men will vote for class officers.
