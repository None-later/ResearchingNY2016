Cap First Match
Against R Pl

State’s bowling team copped its
first victory of the inter-collegiate
campaign Wednesday night down-
ing RJPI by two games to one. Next
Wednesday State meets Albany
Pharmacy.

In the first game against RPI,
paced by Cramer's high single of
280 which was high for the match,
the engineers topped the Statesman
by eighteen pins, winning 869-851.
Joe Carosella’s 187 was high for
State in this first game.

Farley High Man

In the middle game of the even-
ing State beat the Trojans by a de-
cisive eighty-eight pin edge, winning
876-788. Hank Farley's 187 was
high for State while Cramer again
paced the Engineers with a 185
game. Joe Carosella and Fran
Mullin chipped in with good games
to give the State keglers the edge.
State Wins Rubber

By taking the third or "rubber"
game the representatives of State
were able to take the match. Fran
Mullin continued his steady rolling
and came up with a 199 to pace
State. 'The edge in this game was
again a decisive eighty-five points.
And again it was RPI‘s Cramer who
took individual honors with a nifty
200 game. This game gave Cramer
a 665 for the three game match
while State's best was Fran Mul-
lin's neat 555.

ltCould Happen Here . . . ‘
There was once upon a time a
sport that was called tennis. It
required skill and endurance but it
seemed that tennis would be “writ-
ten off the books." Only one en-
thuslast, by the name of “Bye”
showed great interest. He constant-
ly entered all tournaments and de-
monstrated exceptional ability.
Nevertheless the ‘ game gradually
died out. . . . ‘ ' I
