A goody-goody appeal is no good. Nor is it a
help to intimate that, as the largest Teachers’ Col-
lege in the state, we should give, as a whole, more
than the smallest amount, as we did last year. But
a spark of9internationalistic feeling will produce
results beyond our limited concept of the value
of a dollar. That spirit results in saying, willingly,
“I’ll never miss a buck if it means food or some-
thing for some character studying at French State
Teachers’ College, majoring in English!”

    
 
  
   
 
 
   
  
   
 

Supply and Demand

   

What has happened to Press Bureau? No Camp-

spite of their desire for news from State; little or
no information in home town papers about some
students with important positions here; and in-
expert, if not incorrect procedure in the Who’s
Who ballotting add up to a minus in efficiency or
interest. The demand for news of State students
is there; the machinery for production is estab-
lished; why aren’t the goods forthcoming?

In regard to the trees recently planted along the Walk
in front of Page Hall, and in view of the fact that
this has been the only convenient place for intramural
football games, the question is raised, which is the
more important—the beauty of the campus or the
Tealth of our future teachers?

RED CROSS

The proposed Red Cross Chapter here could offer
among other things monetary and other aid to vets,
home nursing and home economic courses and aid to
anyone in an emergency. It might be well to attend
the meeting next week.

INSURANCE AGAIN

U. S. Life Insurance Company is sending out letters
explaining the recently adopted plan to the parents
of all State College students, so maybe if they‘re con—
vincing we’ll all have insurance before We know it.

PREFERENTIAL VOTING

Unfortunately there is no space available to keep
our promise of an explanation of preferential voting.
However, for several reasons, it does seem to be the
best and most democratic method available to us and
its greatest draw back is the fact that it is not under—
stood by a great majority of the student voters. For
instance, in the past some people have voted for their
favorite candidate and then placed last on their ballot,
the person they thought would give the moat competi-
tion to their first choice. This does not work because
second choice is not even considered until their first
chotce is either eliminated or elected. Why does not
the voting committee draw up and publish a detailed
explanation in non-technical language, on explana—
tion of the theory and mechanics of the system and
make it available to the entire student body? Other-
WISe not only will this system not be used to its great—
est benefit but will probably eventually be replaced
by a simpler though less democratic system to the loss

The Winter season is nearly up-
on us. By Winter season we mean
as far as sports are concerned, As
yet WAA has not appointed its
Captains for the coming season but
it is highly probable that such
news will be forthcoming within
the next week.

Why don’t the various group
houses, sororities, etc., start think-
ing about their teams now or at
least decide as to whether or not
they will enter one in the leagues.
Just as it seems fashionable to be
late for a play so also it seems to
be fashionable to enter a team and
then withdraw it. We realize that
there are many reasons for such an
act but it does give rise to many
otherwise avoidable difficulties.
The captains have enough to do
'without continually changing an
already complicated schedule and
rearranging games.

 

Looks like St. Mary’s is in for
another benefit. If all goes well the
money received from the State vs.
Alumni basketball game will go to
“The Angels." This is the opener
of the season and will undoubtedly
attract a large gate. The game
should be a. good indication of how
the “home boys” wil look during
the following season.

Coach Hathaway is giving the
fellows plenty of practice but the
team will also need a lot of moral
support from the rest of the school,
so let’s "give ‘em all we've got."
Some of last year’s turnouts
wouldn’t even be a credit to a
school of 400 much less a college of
1300.

 

IN MEMORIAM
We wish to extend our con-

dolences for all those who died

attempting to perform their

duties on the Tennis courts.

George Poulos took State's first
Cross-Country meet last Saturday,
running the two—mile course in
10:12.6. The runners plan another
meet for tomorrow.

 

Our newly formed Tumbling Club
is off to a good start. 25 enthusi-
asts have turned out, promising a
good future.

Frosh-Sophs To Meet
In Rivalry Volleyball

The Soph-frosh rivalry volleyball
game will be held on Wednesday,
November 12. This game will mark
the fifth contest between the
classes and the first time that vol-
leyball has been played for rivalry
credit.

The freshman team defeated
Myskanla in a preliminary contest.
The fresh displayed ability at the
basic skills of the game and may
well give the Sophs a tussle.

Team Captains

The Sophomore team will be cup—
taincd by Ruth Mattison. WAA
Manager for the Class of '50. while
Lucy Lytle, '49. will coach the frosh
team. Miss Lytle has announced
that practice will be held on the
Dorm field from 10-12 on Tuesday,
Armistice Day. She urges all fresh
who are interested in playing in the.
rivalry game to come.

in Hockey

Winners Score Twice
in Second Period Drives

Bowing under the superior force
of a fast, well coordinated Sopho-
more team, the plucky frosh hockey
squad was defeated 2-0 in Wed-
nesday's rivalry contest. Sparked
by center Ellie Adams, the Sophs
captured the three rivalry points
offered.

Despite poor field conditions due
to rain, both teams played excellent
hockey. The game was one of the
best hockey contests played here in
some time.

Sophs Score

The Sophomores opened the game
by continually putting the gremlins
on the defensive. They were able
to keep the ball deep in ‘51‘s terri-
tory throughout most of the first
half. The defensive work of the
frosh, however, prevented scoring
during the period.

The second half saw the frosh
drive into the offensive. The Sophs,
however. tightened defenses and
again drove into Gremlin territory.
Following a beautiful down field
play, Adams succeeded in scoring
the first Soph point. The ball
changed hands repeatedly as each
team strove to score. The Blue-
Jays moved into the greinlin strik-
ing circle and after two attempts
blocked by goalie Pat Jal, Adams
again scored for the Sophs.

That “Bo” McMillan, now the
celebrated coach of the Indiana
Hoosiers, was one of the chief par-
ticipants in history’s most famous
football upsets? Playing fullback
for tiny Centre College in their 1921
meeting with Harvard, McMillan
scored the touchdown that spelled
defeat for the previously unbeaten
Crimson, in a game that rocked
the world of sports to its founda-
tions.

That George Strohmeyer, the
sterling Notre Dame center who
was mentioned on several All-Am-
erica teams last year, was one of
the nation’s best schoolboy ath-
letes? During his four-year high
school career, Strohmeyer earned
no less than forty~four sports
awards.

That sports experts are in a state
of confusion concerning the recent
statement from the British Minis-
try of Information which makes
the sport of lacrosse the national
game of England? What has the
dopesters stumped is that lacrosse
is the only distinctive sporting event
which was contributed to the White
man by the American Indian!

That while the official Olympic
high-jump record stands at a lit-
tle over fourteen feet, eight inches,
Cornelius Warmerdam, the "Flying
Dutchman,“ has beaten the mark
in every meet he has appeared in?
Warmerdam, who is the only man
who has ever high-jumped fifteen
feet or better, has set an indoor
record of 15 feet, 6 inches, and an
