Van, Denburgh
.Reiires Position
Held 27 Years

State College has lest another
member of its administration dur-

. mg the past week. Miss Van Den-

burgh resigned her position as
Registrar, after having served the
college in this capacity for the past
27 years. During her time spent in
the office, she worked under the
administrations of Dr. A. R. Bru-
backer and Dr. J. M. Sayles.

This resignation last week was
not a complete surprise to the
school, because Miss Van Denburgh
planned to leave at the end of sum-
mer session. However, the date that
she was leaving was unannounced,
so that her departure was unex—
pected. As a result, the State Col-
lege News was not able to secure a
personal interview with Miss Van
Denburgh. We were able to secure
some information about our ex-
Registrar from Dean Nelson, how—
ever, and the following are a few
facts about her life outside the
office.

Miss Van Denbui'gh was a mem—
ber of Phi Beta Kappa, the na—
tional honorary fraternity, and on
campus. she served on the faculty
of Psi Gamma sorority.

Before leaving the school last Fri-
day, the faculty held a farewell tea
in her honor. Dr. M. L. Hayes. As-
sistant Professor of English, was in
charge of the affair; Mrs. Saylcs
and Mrs. Nelson poured. There
were a large number of faculty
members present, and they present-
ed Miss Van Denburgh with a
leather traveling bag, as a going-
away gift. Miss Burbank, Dr.
Sayles' secretary, was also guest of
honor at. this tea.

At present, Miss Van Denburgh
is visiting in Utica. She will re-

turn to Albany on Nwember 10, to

prepare for her trip to Florida.
After spending the winter there she
plans to reside permanently in Al-
bany after next April.

Art 6 Students
Arrange Displays

Members of the Classical and Art
6 class. "Design Through Visual

chins, Assistant Professor of Fine
Arts.

Members of the class have been
assigned to the bulletin board of
their major or minor subject. They
choose topics and try for a bal—
anced. colorful presentation. The
experiment has the triple purpose
of presenting information. giving
experience to the Art students, and
providing examples of good 13111101—

Sandwiches, Prices, Over-Crowding, Scored By Students
In College-Wide Dissatisfaction With Cafeteria Conditions

General dissatisfaction with the
State College Cafeteria was indi-
cated this week in a poll taken by
the STATE COLLEGE NEWS. Stu-
dents who were interviewed showed
either extreme dissatisfaction, in-
difference. or mild approbation, but
there were very few who rose to
the defense of the cafeteria.

The questions asked by the poll
takers were these: "What is your
opinion of the State College Cafe-
teria?”, and “What changes, if any,
do you think should be made in the
cafeteria?" .

From the one hundred eighty-
two people questioned. sixty-eight
per cent definately believe that. the
cafeteria is not functioning satis-
factorily, that the prices are too
high, that the food, particularly
the sandwiches, is poor. Twenty-
sevcn per cent are indifferent. They
either don‘t eat in the cafeteria,
or else they have nothing to offer
one way or the other about con-
ditions. Only eight per cent of the
students think that the cafeteria
does a good job. that the food is
good and the prices fair.

One Sophomore thinks that the
food is as good as possible, consid-
ering the prices the managers have
to pay. and the low prices at which
food is offered to the public. An-
other remarked that we don't re-

 

Brimmer Speaks
At Conference

Mrs. Bertha E. Brimmer, Secre—
tary of the Alumni Association at
a fall luncheon meeting of the Na-
tion‘s Capitol Branch of the State
College for Teachers' Alumni Asso-
ciation, held in Washington. D. C.
After the meeting the Branch made
a money contribution which com-
bined with a money gift from the
class of 1941 makes the amount suf-
ficient to buy the china which will
be used for the first time at the
Sayles Hall ten next Sunday.

Elizabeth Cal-many, Dorothy Mey-
ers and Aime Ludington, recent
graduates, were president and ac-
cepted responsibilities for the May
meeting. Several other members of
this Branch have teaching posi-
tions or fill important government
positions. .

The Capitol Branch has in the
past undertaken projects to help
the Residence Halls, which were
built by 1110 alumni in 1935 and in
1941. Last summer they sent mon—
cy to 110 used for cups and saucers
for 1.011 parties at Snylcs Hall.

for coffee.

allze how prices have gone up.

One of the main gripes, however,
is that prices are too high. Partl-
cularly resented is the fifteen cents
for sandwiches, and the seven cents
Some feel that soup

could be sold for less than twelve
cents.

A 49'er says that she used to eat
there when she was a freshman.
and other upper classmen commen-
ted that the majority of cafeteria
patrons are freshmen who don‘t
know their way around yet.

Several people would rather see
the cafeteria management raise the
prices and improve the food. One
Sophomore says, “I think it’s dis-
gusting that some people should
have no choice but to eat
They should raise prices and give
us decent food. We need more var-
iety—the sandwiches are awful and
they should try to offer more in
the way of a balanced diet, in-
cluding particularly more fruit. A
sandwich and a cup cake do not
make a good lunch."

A Junior suggests that two cash-
iers would speed the line at noon,
and that the sandwich counter line.
in crossing the dinner line causes
confusion.

“You stand in line for a long time

there.
