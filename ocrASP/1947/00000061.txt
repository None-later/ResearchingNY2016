Time Will Tell

State College has been the possessor of a unique
institution called Rivalry almost as long as it has
had freshman and Sophomore classes. Sometimes
the forms of the Rivalry institutions weren’t good,
but always, the spirit behind them was of the
highest.

This year a great question has arisen—not as
to the form but the spirit—namely, where is it?
Rivalry has always been something that Juniors
and Seniors look at interestedly and, at the same
time, reminisce about their “good old days". Its
essence is remembered long after graduation.

Will this year be different? Definitely, if last
Friday in assembly, is to be a typical example.
Apparently the only one who knew any of the
words to the songs in the entire frosh class was the
songleader. As for the Sophomores, they didn‘t
even look as if they cared.

Admittedly, it was near the lunch hour but come
now—was it lunch or a cigarette and the Commons
that produced the sudden anxiety? Some members
of our illustrious student body even went to the
pains of almost annihilating the marshals in their
haste to get out of the auditorium.

We often sit in history classes here and smirk-
ineg discuss those ignorant masses of humanity
who take no interest in their local, state, or na-
tional government. We pride ourselves because
we are cognizant of the fact that the backbone of
democracy is an intelligent anti alert electorate.
We are not of those ignorant onesi

No? The majority of the members of this Student
Association sit in assembly merely because they
will have to take a cut if not there. The govern-
ment with which we have the closest contacts, our
own school government is the one in which we ap-
parently take the least interest. When we have
been graduated from this institution, we will not
change overnight. The interest taken in school
affairs is indicative of our interest in the civic
affairs of our future life and at this point, it doesn‘t
look too good.

The most common complaint seems to be, “As-
semblies are boring to one such as I.” Naturally,
when you have no interest in them and exert no
efforts in their behalf. At the risk of being repeti—
tions of other editorials, you get out of a thing pre-
cisely what you put into it.

Dean Nelson allows Student Association the
widest latitude in planning and conducting their
assemblies. If we did not have such a, self-govern-
ing body. cries of (liszu'mroval and disscnsion would
be heard far and wide.

Whether last week’s fiasco with the Rivalry sing
was a result of boredom in assembly or a lack of
spirit on the part of the frosh and Sophomores, no
one knows. The two lower classes never lacked
spirit in previous years~—lhc two lower classes
must have spirit DOW—SOIIICWIICI'C. At, any rate,
they will have other chances to display it under
more favorable circumstances in the near future.
Here‘s hoping!

Sorority Rules . . .

Editors note: Because of the con-
fusion resulting in the new rush
rules, we are reprinting the revised
rules for the silent period as they
stand now.

 

Article IV. The formal rush period
is one of silence between rushees
and sorority members except for
two parties to be given by sororities
for invited rushees. It begins at
midnight on the Friday preceedlng
Thanksgiving vacation and extends
until the 5 o’clock pledge service
on the second Tuesday following
Thanksgiving Vacation.

Article IV, Section C. Invitations
to rush parties shall be in the office
of the Dean of Women by 9 o’clock

of the Thursday before Thanksgiv-
ing vacation and shall be mailed
the Friday proceeding the recess.

This year formal rush period will
begin at midnight November 22.
Freshmen will receive their invita-
tions on November 22 and should
return them in the next mail. The
rules have been changed so that
freshmen can make plans to attend
and so that sororities will know
how many people will attend in time
to make adequate preparations.

Freshmen may not travel to or
from vacations with sorority women
unless special permission is granted
by the President of Intersorority
Council.

To the Editor:

This letter is being written with
no association to the Intergroup
Council. but as an individual mem-
ber c, the Student Association.

Sa urday evening, Dr. J. L. More-
no presented a sociodrama to a
State College audience. Dr. Moreno
is a specialist in the field—it is a
new field — the sociodrama is a
comparatively new technique. In
fact, the majority 01' the college
representation was completely tin-
inltiated — even the word “socio-
dramn" had become a mystery.

At. any rate, the auditorium was
full. It was a curious audience,
curious to find the answer to the
publicity campaign that had reach-
ed a major height. ’l‘ht‘rc was one
difficulty the group (lid not know,
or was not prepared, for the result-
ing program.

The purpose of the program was
to introduee to an assembly of fu—
ture teachers, a process that they
would be able to use in their class-
room. if they deemed it advisable.
it was to inform them about. some-
thing new in the field.

l-iowcvcr. I admit, that it was un-
fortuiuitc that the "skit" had a
negative approach. The situation
was a personal one. thus resulting
in the factor that the subject was
unable to project hcrscif complelcir
and freely. llecausc of the incom—
pletc response twhich was the
fault of no one concerned), the
audlcncc was dissatisfied, for no
dirch cmcluslon could be drawn,
nor any correlations made. It cer-
tainly was a natural reaction.

But. let us not forget also. that
the ].u'ograin was not. vuluclcss -tllc

objector with his intense objection
will admit. this.

The students deserve to get what
they expect. Even in retrospect, if
Morcno's handling of the situation
was not. pleasing stop and remem-
hcr that you have LEARNED. A
week ago many would not even have
been qualified to discuss a such) or

The discussions are good both

This is in the form of a complaint.
For the first time ill years. some at-
tention is being givcn by the ad-
ministration to the conditions of
safety and health in the lo\vcr hull
of Draper. Smoking has been pro-
hibited. anything that. might. lead
to congestion has been eliminated
and the halls havo been painted.
th thcrc still remains a very dau—
gerous hazard . . . hot. pipes! (,‘ould
n't. something be done to eliminate
the dungcr involved in steaming ra-
diator pipes, in the lower hall of
Draper? Aside from being uncom-
fortublc when you brush against
them, they constitute a fire hazard.
Since we are making every nilctnpi
to eliminate smoking hazards, why
not. go all the way?

Wlillt‘ on the subject of health.
how about the temperature of the
rooms We spend most of our time
in. It. ranges anywhere from below

BM Mm‘d 3%
By EUGENE MOLAREN W

This Reporter is given the widest'latitude as author
of this column, although his viewpoints do not neces-
sarily reflect those of the STATE COLLEGE Naws.

Congratulations are in order this week to Inter-
Group Council, and Joy Simon in particular, for the
extremely successful conference held here last week.
Too bad, partly because of the inexperience of the
audience and partly because of the poor cooperation,
that sociodrama conducted by Dr. Morena was far
over the heads of most of the audience.

LET’S SING AGAIN

Pertaining to last week's assembly, equal blame goes
to the freshmen, for not knowing their songs and
poor organization; the student body, for inexcusable
rudeness and lack of cooperation; and Student Coun-
cil for trying to schedule both a speaker of unknown
lung capacity and the freshmen sing at the same
assembly. Crowded as the assembly program is this
fall, in fairness to all concerned, this sing should
be re-scheduled. The preservation of a grand old
tradition is surley more important than some of these
speakers and events no one listens to anythow.
COME TO THE DANCE

Misconceptions about the coming Christmas semi-
formal should be cleared up. First it is semi-formal.
Second, it is for all the college, its main purpose being
to hold a dance in which the whole college can par-
ticipate and attend. Any independent who would like
to help. and that help is definitely needed, should see
one of the committee, named in another section of
the NEWS.

STATE SPIRIT

Orchids to Gamma Kap for keeping its open house
last week a strictly State College affair. Several men
from other colleges were politely refused admittance,
and a good time was had by all.
CONGRATULATIONS

Best wishes to President “Twink”, now Alice Princile
Walsh, on her recent marriage. The happy event oc-
curred on October 18 in Peekskill, with the lucky man
being Don Walsh, formerly of the class of ’45 here
at State, and now attending Albany Law School.
NEW CO-OI‘ MANAGER

There will be a change of managers of the State
College Co-op come January first. Mrs. Bull is re-
signing due to the fact that her husband has re-
ceived a permanent commission in the Air Forces.
The new chief book-seller will be Ray Verrey, Grad—
uate, who is also house manager of Van Der Zee Hall.
ROUND AND ROUND

The Who's Who situation has degenerated to such
an extent that. it's almost impossible to look at it ra—
tionally. The importance of being in Who's Who has
been blown up all out of proportion to its true value.
Actually. it‘s undoubtedly a money making scheme
for the publishers. and. outside of the temporary glow
of self-satisfaction and the possible value it may
have in an employment folder, it doesn‘t mean much.

Since everyone agrees that the election was unfair.
th obvious thing to do is hold a re-election, under
the proper supervision. if it develops that there is
time to do so. Plans have been made to do this today.
if it develops that the publishers will delay the dead-
lme. If not, the whole matter should be dropped, and
the decision left. up to the individuals involved as to
whether they send in their forms. with no pressure
either way.

(‘AIFE’I‘ERIA REPLY

Miss Shordny, manager of the cafeteria, feels that
the criticism expressed in the NEWS poll last week
is unjustified in that. she feels that the students pol—
led wcrc for the most part uninformed as to the actual
situation which exists. Although she admits that the
cafeteria lacks the so-called "atmosphere" which some
of the local cstablisluncnts m'c reputed to have. she
feels that the average of 750 persons who eat at the
cafeteria each day are provided with good food. prc-
pnrcd under cleaner conditions, and at prices which
compare vcry favorably with these other establish-
ments. Sevrn cont coffee is necessary to oft-set the
l'ilStl‘ in ()\’t‘l'Il(‘tl(I, including the salary increases, she
c u ms.

At present, We have an open mind in the absence
ot' any specific figures on the subject. but. in order to
detcrminc just what is what, Miss Shorcduy has com—
plied with a request that a t'ull months itemized ac—
count of receipts and cxpcnscs be furnished t'or pub-
lication. which will be presented in next Week‘s NEWS.

PAOI a

 

 

Sic/elated

By JACK BROPHY

 

 

 

Baseball stuck is head out from
under its winter wraps for a few
minutes the other day when we had
the pleasure of a chat with Dick
Fowler of the Philadelphia A's. We
came upon the big right-hander in
the men‘s store where he is em-
ployed during the winter months,
and proceeded to bombard Dick with
questions.

Sat Out No-Hittcr

Dick Fowler is one-third of the
A’s starting trio of Marchildon-
Christopher-Fowler, considered one
of the better hurling staffs in the
American League. The quiet, unas-
suming, 195 pound six-footer wound
up the ’47 campaign with a 12-10
record which included two 2-1 losses
to Feller and the Indians. A veteran
of Canadian Army service, Dick as-
tounded the baseball world in 1945
by throwing a 1-0 no-hitter against
the Browns only three weeks after
returning to the diamond. When
asked the inevitable question, “when
did you first know that you were
pitching no-hlt ball". Dick related
that he knew as early as the fifth
inning, and was sitting in the club
house after retiring the side in the
ninth when the A’s pushed over the
only score of the game in the last
half. Dick continued to hold his
spell over the Browns last season by
beating them in four of their five
meetings. While on the other hand,
the Washington Senators are Dick's
particular nemesis, beating the A‘s
hurler in three out 01' four games
last season.

“They’re All Tough"

Turning to more personal facts
we asked Dick just how he threw
his stuff and what his most depend-
able delivery was. "You soon learn
in the major leagues“, he answered,
“that the baseline. coaches will call
your pitches for the batter unless
you use the same grip for every
pitch. I grip mine across the seams.
When I‘m in a tight spot I always
rely on my change of pace." And
who was the toughest batter to pitch
to? “For me. two hundred of them!
They‘re all tough."

Notice

On Monday. November 17th. in
Room III of Draper Hall, the
Tumbling Club will hold a. meeting
for the purpose of electing officers.

State Bowlers
Roll To Win

Over Lawyers

State‘s bowling team moved closer
to first place in the intercollegiate
bowling league with a 3-0 win over
Law School Wednesday night. The
same evening Siena moved into
first place with a 3-0 victory over
Pharmacy, as RPI downed ABC, 2-1.

Paced by Fran Mullln‘s 201 game,
the statesmen rolled to a 850-668
win over the Lawyers in the first
game. This margin was the largest
edge of the match as the two teams
began to hit the alleys with more
accuracy.

Single Pin Edge

Moving into the middle game of
the match, the State keglers came
out on top with a 150 pin edge.
Hank Farley's neat 224, high single
of the match. paced the State pin-
men. The third and final game
went right down to the last frame
before State‘s one pin advantage
gave them the game. The score of
the closest single game to date was
852-851. Chipping in with a 191
single “Diz” Dickinson led the
statesmen to the close win and a
sweep of the three game match.
Marty Bortnick's 560 triple was high
for the tilt.

Goes To British

On Armistice Day a crowd of
about 1590 people, representing all
the colleges in the vicinity, gath-
ered at Emma Willard school to
watch the amazing British team
defeat a womens‘ team from Mo-
hawk: 16-0.

The British team plays a “heads
down" game. It is fast and aggres-
sive play which never gives opposi-
tion a chance to get on the offen-
sive. Playing with the forward sec-
tion of their sticks, the English
team, composed of women in their
middle ages, pushed forward with
long, hard drives; playing to pre-
arranged positions they had their
plays down to a  and never made
a lost motion.

Mary Dix, center-forward for the
team of the boyish haircuts, was
by all odds the outstanding star.
She scored, perhaps, 10 of the goals
and led her line in perfect forma-
tion.

Although Mohawk has one of the
foremost teams in this section of
the country, they were able to do
no more than the other teams which
the English girls have met. They
have met approximately twelve
teams since arriving in this country
and no team has been able to score
against them.

Many examples of superior play
were evidenced by the Mohawk play
ers. In fact as an American team
they would probably be one of the
toughest: however, against the con-
sistent skill of the entire British
team, which played as one man,
they went to no avail.

As soon as an All-American team
is chosen. from all the United States
teams. it will face the visitors.

Rivalry Volleyball Tilts
Rescheduled For Wed.

Both men and women will meet in
Rivalry Volleyball, on November
19th in the Page Hall Gym. This is
the first time either of these events
have been played for points, and the
first time the men have engaged in
this activity at all.

Last year the Sophomores of ’49
defeated the frosh of '51; but the
contest was not played for rivalry
points.

Sport Captains

Sport Captains for the winter sea-
son were appointed at a WAA Coun-
cil meeting held Monday. These
Captains will begin work on their
[respective sports lnnnediately.

Captains in charge of basketball
include Juanita Evans and Bev. Sit-
ttg, Juniors, and Ruth Smith, Sop-
homore. They have requested that
all teams wishing to enter the league
this year supply them with a list
of team members before Friday,
November 21.

Ann Ethal, '49. has been appoint-
ed as captain of lifesaving while
swimming will be under the direc-
tion of Alice Reiman, ’49. Sopho-
mores Dee Weber and Sue Miller
will have charge of Ping Pong. Mic-
key Seaman, '49, will captain fenc-
ing and Earline Thompson, '50, will
lead winter sports.

Bowling Captains appointed were
Angie Ricci, '48, and Audrey Ado-
phso, '49.

Starting this week we are going
to give a. short- write-up each week
of two varsity players. This week our
players are Cy Fersh and Kenny
George.

Cy, playing his first year at State,
was high scorer on last year’s squad.
He measures six foot one, weighs
180 pounds. and can play a. long time
at a good pace. Cy started his bas-
ketball career at Poughkeepsie High
School. He continued his basket-
ball career in the Army, playing for
a strong Fort Knox squad. His best
performances last year were 22
points against E?! and seventeen
counters against Plattsburg.

Kenny is another second year
Varsity player, and he playedfresh-
man ball at State prior to his tArmy
service. He is 5 ft. 6 inches tall,
and weighs 150 pounds; and is the
speed-merchant of State’s team.
Kenny has a good eye and was sec-
ond high scorer during the 46-47
season; besides being an excellent
play-maker. He comes from Philip
Schuyler High where he was a four-
letter man in sports.
