Our Business? - .‘

Two weeks ago the Srm: COLLEGE News pub-
lished a poll of student opinion'on the cafeteria
uestion. We. do not claim to be Gallop experts but

we do feel that the poll. expressed the general at-
titude of the student body towards the cafeteria.

Realizing that this story, like every other story,
had_two sides, we took our complaints to Mrs.
Shoreday who was prompt to exclaim that the stu-
dents had -no conception of the real situation. We
quickly agreed and waited patiently for a little en-
lightenment so we might gain some conception of
that situation.

In a small way, we do realize that prices have
gone up and we are of the opinion that most of
the students expected some rise in their cost of
living this year. But the main gripe seems to be,
“Why can we eat for less at the profit-seeking res-
taurants in this vicinity than we can at our own
non-profit cafeteria?”

 

The manager of the cafeteria was approached
again and an itemized list of monthly income and
expenditures was promised a staff member 1’or
publication to prove to the student body that the
cafeteria has its problems too. The time approach-
ed for the publication of the figures and no figures
were available. They were considered, to put it
politely—“Of no interest to the student body.”

Granted we don’t have subsidies from the state,
granted that bread has gone up two cents, and
granted that we may seek those more “atmospheric”
places of eating if we so desire, but there are those
of us who are unfortunate enough due to schedule
difficulties to be forced to eat at the cafeteria. We
of this select group, consider the type of food we
receive for our money of the utmost importance to
us.

Maybe the way in which the money is spent is
none of our business, but the quality of food and
the prices we pay, definitely are.

But then it is not our due to complain, is it?
We are merely the insignificant, little people who
must retire like good little children and do what our
elders think best for us.

A New System

Front page this week carries a story concerning
new appointments to the News staff. In addition
to our regular number of Sophomore desk editors,
we have appointed three Seniors and four Juniors
to work as reporters.

In past years the three Sophomore desk editors
who were not advanced to associate editors, were
dropped from the staff entirely. Under the new
system, these people will remain on as reporters
through their Junior and Senior years. The News
has felt for some time that there was a needless
waste of experience and talent under the old sys—
tem and we hope to remedy that with our new plan.

The new plan will go into effect after 'I‘hztnks-
giving and we hope it proves successful.

No critic could have the consum-
mate gall to stand against Advanc-
ed Dramwtlcs, the little seizer of
triumphs, that, with its standards
and egos raised on high, comes on
lnvlncibly, strengthened by the ap-
plauding legions of its State College
following. One might well say that
histrionlcs is being written now, and
that -AD 1947 begins to have a spec-
ial significance. No critic could now
have the gall to be cocky enough to
crow over the deficiencies of AD,
even though having cause . . where-
upon, cries of “chicken” go up on
all sides.

Not so—though I might facetlous-
ly refer to the “Pox Dramatica” that
seems here to stay, let me acknowll-
edge that the productions of Kinn
and Mills presented last Tuesday
night are deserving of praise. Yet let
there be no talk of unconditional
surrender of esthetic values. If I
have heretofore thrown my criti—
cisms into bold relief, it was only to
make apparent the fact that a. great
deal was to be desired and could be
attained. There is no stench like the
stench of mediocrity.

Very little odor clings to Everson
Kinn. His use of a truncated set
was not without effect, definitely
unconventional and good. Lee Chea-
tham’s work, as always, had a love-
ly perfume to it. “Stew” Camp—
bell showed remarkable improve-

 

ment over his previously muscle- ‘

bound performances. As for the
newcomer, Tony Prochilo did a
bang-up job, although there was
about him the inevitable air of
body - and - voice - conscmusness, of
stage-awkwardness, of not playing
the make-believe as if it were the
truth. Those whom I interviewed
rated this as the best play thus far
this year.

We shall praise Harry Mills to the
sky for aspiring to produce anim-
mensely difficult tragedy, but we
shall damn him for misconceiving
the greater part of his lighting ef-
fects and presenting us with a ka-
leidoscopic display that confused
not only the light crew but the spec-
tators. Warren Reich failed to re-
alize that there is more to being,
fiendish than having a good voice.
There were also other disembodied
voices on the stage that did not
make as telling an effect as Reich.
Without a doubt what success the
play enjoyed is almost solely attri-
butable to the efforts of Giff Win-
gate. He was the whole fire of the
play; yet, if he had burned less
fiercely at times, he might have
succeeded in making the climaxes
of the play more the blazing high-
points they should have been.

But I must concur that they are
beginning to conquer.

Enwye S. Seetea paraded boldly
up to the door of Phi Pho Phum
and gave worth with a loud whistle.
As the Phi Pho’s were having open
house that night, and as it was ex-
tremely cold outside, they let him
in. The receptionist greeted him
with animated disinterest.

“Oh, hello Enwye." At this, all
those radiant little Phi Pho faces
which had been peering out from
the kitchen, down from the stair-
way, and up from behind the um-
brella rack, suddenly clouded and
disappeared from sight. “Take off
your mackiuaw and go on in the
other room; they’re having a lot of
fun.” Enwye recognized this as a
standard phrase employed by all
sorority bell-hops, but he tossed his
pink plaid coat and gold car-muffs
on top of the heap of racoons, and
advanced confidently to the living
room.

Indeed they were having a lot of
funl Stunned, Enwyc clutched for
support at the clean white door
frame with his dirty little hands.
Hundreds of strangers had invaded
his domain. There they were —
screaming. singing, dancing, and po-
go-sticking around the room on
slide-rules.

“What manner of spirits be
these?” quoth Enwye aghast, but
his voice was lost; in a chorus of
"To the Mudflats of Cohoes." Alas,
the worst blow of all was that the
girls-~HIS girls, seemed to be en-
joying themselves. He slumped inio
u chainin the corner already occu-
pied by five couples, and brooricd
over the fickleness of women. Why

O’BRIEN .____-.___.__.._____
only that noon those some girls
while dancing with one another in
the Commons had smiled sweet
nothings up to him as he posed
masculiner on the balcony. Now
there they were choosing to dance
with those gabardine-clad gamins
rather than to discuss the socio-
drama with him. Where was their
school spirit, and who were these
foreigners who did not wish to see
the Union preserved? Digging him-
self out from the pile of arms, legs,
punch glasses, and cookie-crumbs
in which he had been reposing,
Enwye sidled over to the group
eonguinted at the piano. All the
songs were dedicated to Arple Aye-
a person whom they all loved very
dearly, and to his sweetheart, Polly
Tek. Summoning up some of the
old'Seeteu courage that had made
him the lion of the touch-football
gridiron, Enwye accosted one of the
meekcr intruders.

“Suy~who is Arple Aye anyway?"
A great silence fell upon the gather-
ing, and all faces turned in his cli-
iection. One of the foreigners drew
a blueprint from his vest poeket,
and handed it to Enwye, speaking
in a quiet but. ominous voice.

“Tomorrow at sunrise—T squares
ut the square root. of 10 paces." Poor
Enwye glanced at. the leering circle
around him, then fled from Phi Pho
Phum into the night. Along the
windswept Western Way, and across
the frozen river Purtridge he sped,
in hopes that. the angels who dwell-
ed beyond in their Celestial Shucks
might. champion his cuuse in their
next. cplsile to the people.

SILENCE REIGNS

As of five o’clock today, open season on freshmen
women draws to a close, to the relief of everyone
in college, particularly those directly concerned with
such an objectionable rush system.

The whole purpose of a. rush system should be to
acquaint the freshmen with ALL the various sorori-
ties, but on this campus it has degenerated to a case
of each sorority trying by clever notes, force of person-
ality, or just plain hanging on, to monopolize a. fresh-
man’s time. Just how is a. freshman to become widely
acquainted under these conditions, except by the
dog-eat-dog methods which they naturally invite?
The sororities could well take a lesson from the fra-
ternities in this, who get along far better under far
simpler rules, though admittedly under somewhat
different conditions.

We hope that the freshmen this year will make
their decisions logically rather than emotionally. We
think that. they should join a sorority on the basis
of which one contains their best frcinds and their
most friends, and only on this basis. More importance
should be attached to members of the lower classes,
as the seniors will soon be departing. As these are
merely social organizations, any other basis than
friendship put forward is a mere rushing tool, and
should be disregarded as such.

Regardless of assurances to the contrary, there will
be hard feelings as usual on the part of some indi-
viduals, but freshmen shouldn’t even consider that
in making their choice. Any true friend will remain
so, even though he may disapprove of a. decision. A
true friend, that is. So, freshmen, don't lose any sleep
over any lost "temporary" friends.

RAH! RAII! RAH!

The varsity cheerleaders are working out these days
in preparation for the coming season.

In regard to cheerleaders, a very poor system of
selection of the varsity cheerleaders is in effect here.
Rather than being selected for merit and ability, they
are elected, which is not good to fill a job which re-
quires certain skills. Here there is no incentive for
an underclassman to work hard, as there is no as-
surance they will be advanced or even be a cheer-
leader the foliowing year. This should be changed, and
also WAA and MAA should award points towards let-
Ler awards for the cheerleaders. Present cheerleaders
desire these changes so let's back them up and give
it to them.

N0 BUDGET

The cafeteria budget promised us last Week was not
forthcoming this week, the explanation being that it
really was no business of the students. Maybe so,
as the college students don't have to eat there, but
why have a cafeteria at all if it’s of no concern to
the students? All we were able to obtain was the
fact that. of the total income, salaries account for
about 33%, food nearly 67% with only 0.4% as sur-
plus to use as overhead for equipment etc., plus
the Well known,fnct that all the food prices have
risen. If an actual budget is desired, it will have to
be requested from the President of the college. Any-
one intercsicd had best form a committee.
INTERIOR DECORATIONS

Now that we have beautificd the front lawn of Page.
how about the lower hall of Draper"? In particular, how
about finishing the paint job that was left incomplete
at the end of the summer. That ragged edge along
the black line looks bad from here and certainly does-
n't. impress visitors.

Also it. has been suggest.ch that a few well placed
pictures hung in lower Draper would improve the
appearance quite a bit. Graduating classes might pre-
sent a picture or two and here‘s a chance for the
States-Men to get rid of their surplus.

The purpose of the new Retail

is to prepare teachers who in turn
will prepare high school students
for store positions, according to
Rena S. Knouse, Professor of Mer-
The Retail Merchan-

semi-formal dising course previously culled Dis-

tributive Education, was added to
the curriculum to fill a definite
need.

It includes a background, sub-
course in marketing. one In retail
store operation, and one in selling.
In addition to the school course of
twelve hours. summer experience
and cooperative part-time positions
in local stores are required in order
to be certified to teach merchandis—
ing in High School. This is to give
experience to the prospective teach-
er. Possible aetivities in coopera-
tion with local stores include the
following: interviews with sales-
persons, interviews with customers,
tours of stores, tours of manufac-
turing plants, analyses of merchan-

Co-op Manager
Resigns Position

probably know. if you
read last week’s edition of the
NEWS, the Co-op will start the
new year under new management.
Mrs. Bull has announced that she
will resign from her position at that
time; Raymond Verrey will replace
her.

Mrs. Bull. 111 a recent interview,
stated that. she pltlllS to travel with
her husband, who has accepted an
appointment wfih the U. S. Army.
He served in this capacity during
the war, but hits been :1 civilian for
the past two years.

The Bulls both graduated

According to Mr. Knouse, consid-
ering the fact that the greatest op-
portunities for high school gradu-
ates lies in the merchandising field,
there is a great need to further pro-
vide planned instruction in retail
selling in the high schools of New
York State and nationally. Since
more graduates go into the field of
retail selling than any other, the
need for teacher preparation is very
great. ,

only commerce majors can take
the course for teaching credit, but
it is open as a third or fourth to
majors in other subjects.
