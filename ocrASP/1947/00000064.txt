Pettit To Introduce Radio Critique
Monday On Station WROW

Radio critique, a new idea in
dramatic, artistic and literary re--
view, 'will be introduced over WROW
by Mr. Ralph Pettit, a member of
the State College English depart-
ment. This public service feature
will be presented from 6:45 to 6:55
P. M. every Monday through Fri-
day. The first program is to be
given this Monday, November 24.

This ten minute program will be
devoted to reviews of current
movies. plays, musical events and
art displays shown in the Capitol
District. Mr. Pettit emphasized
that reviews will be completely
honest, without outside influence,
and has no theatrical connections.
In the event of no film or other
reviews, there will be a general dis-
cussion of theatre or film matters.

The first play review will be of
“My Sister Eileen," which is to
be presented November 26 at the
Lodge Street Playhouse. Also next
week, a review will be given of the
works of Samuel Segaloff, English
artist, whose work is on display at
the Albany Institute of History and
Art.

Mr. Pettit also plans to give the
results of an exclusice interview
with Mr. Robert Frost, eminent Am-
erican poet. Next spring the Ad-
vanced Dramatics play at State
College will be reviewed.

This is Mr. Pettit's second experi-
ence in such a capacity. While at
Cornell University, he did a series
of similar broadcasts over WHZU,
Ithaca, New York.

To Face Alums

 Opening Tilt

Coach Hathaway takes the wraps
off this year’s Varsity and JayVees
the first Wednesday after vacation,
at the Page Hall gym. An alumni
squad will provide the opposition for
the Varsity and the JayVees will
tangle with Potter Club.

This year, the Alumni squad will
consist of "Speed" Koblenz, Bob
Combes, George Dixon, Will Fra-
ment, Stan Gipp, Regis Hammond,
“Bolo” Marsland, Ed Reed, Hank
Ruback and Frank Woodworth. This
group is expected to give the Var-
sity plenty of competition.

In last week’s scrimmage against
Pharmacy, State was clearly the
superior team on the floor. Coach
Hathaway was more than satisfied
with the team’s showing. State will
hold another informal scrimmage

*“‘ Bragainst RPI Saturday.

 

The “Old” Question

Last year State scheduled quite

a few teams out of their class and

fit-he inevitable result was only two
wins. Also, on the loss side there
were some pretty bad defeats.

This year should be different, but
whether it is or isn’t, the team is
entitled to better support than it
received last year. There were too
many vacant seats in many of last
year’s games.

Attendance at vicinity games was
limited to a few brave souls ventur-
ing to Siena. There were no facili-
ties to venture any further. This
year the idea is circulating to char-
ter busses and get a group to go to
the “away” games.

On December 2nd, the night be—
fore the Alumni game, there will be
a pep rally held on the Dorm Field,
under the auspices of Student Coun—
cil.

Intramural Program Ready

The deadline for turning in ros-
ters for Intramural Basketball is to-

Lday. Monday and Thursday are the
only available nights so three games
will be played each evening.

According to Joe Zanchelli, ’49,

'- manager, the opening game will be

on Dccembr 4th. The league will
operate in two sections. A meeting
rof team (‘uptnins will be scheduled
soon.

WAA Forms Leagues

tion again this your. The teams will

squad Wednesday in Page Hall gym.
The boys of ‘51 needed just two

team begun to roll. The freshmen
racked up nine points, while hold-
ing the Sophs scoreless and took
the first by the score of 16-6.

'50 came back strong in the sec-
ond game and fought the freshmen
point for point. With the score
Sophs put on a spurt and took a
tied at eight points apiece, the
12-8 lead. The score then moved
to 13-9 with the Sophs serving but

Banging over a touchdown and a
safety early in the first quarter, the
fresh footballers downed the Soph
team in the, rivalry tilt 9-7. Played
in a brisk wind. the game featured
puss interceptions and superior de-
fensive play.

Taking the opening kick—off, the
frosh moved deep into Soph terri-

Here the Sophs took over possession

COLLEGE FLORIST FOR YEARS

——-Special Attention to Sororities and Fraternities

 

7/111“ 7/” all/cop

 

 

Our varsity cagcrs for this week
are three veterans of Coach Merlin
Hathaway's squad of last year;
Tommy O’Brien. Walt Schick and
Basil Karplak.

O'Brien. who hails from across
the river in nearby chsselaer, made
State‘s varsity last fall as a frosh.
He played two years of varsity bas-
ketball at Van Rensselaer High and
played plenty of service ball while
doing his stretch in the Navy. Tom
is 6’1" tall and weighs 160 lbs.
"O.B." is a clear playmaker and his
height makes him valuable for play-
ing off the backboards.

Walt Schick calls Bayshore, Long
Island home and played varsity ball
for Bayshorc HS. Walt played ball
in the E.T.O. for the U. S. Army
and had plenty of experience be-
hind him when he came to Page
Hall gym last your He stands 5’10”
and tips the scales at 170 lbs. He is
one of Coach Hathaway’s "best
“floor” men and possesses an al-
ways dangerous set shot.

Basil Karpiak is another soph
on this year’s Varsity. “Bas” stands
six feet tall, weighs 165, and comes
from Burden Lake. He played high
school ball at Watervlict and played
service ball in the navy. Karp is
proud of the fact that he played for
the “Midway Ramblers" and was
the “id” of last year’s squad. He is
a good ball handler and is big enough
to mix it up under the basket.

Ler pass to Al Holiday allowed the
frosh line to break through and
swear the play for u safety and two
points.

Intercepting a pass thrown by
"Lefty" Blavotnick soon after the
kick-off, the frosh drove to their
second score. A pass from Santora
to Ken Ludlum set up the touch-
down, as the frosh went over on
fake pass play. The Sophs tallied
when John Duffis broke from a
“sleeper” position and gathered in
a long heuve from Bluvotnick.

E Soph Girls Wiri—

Volleyball Fight

Getting oil to an curly and a long
lead. on Wednesday night in the
Page Hall gym, the Soph girls beat
the freshmen by 21 score of 21-6
and 21-15.

Taking the icud—oi‘f points the
Sophs piled up an advantage of
about 15 points before the fresh
girls were able to gain a point. Jean
Hotaling, paced the '50 team, scor-
ing six points on her first serve and
five on her second. From a score

of 14—3 Jean raised it to 19 and Cl'ﬂmel'

then the fresh came back to score
three more points when Elly Adams
took the sc‘rvc. However. she was
nimble to gain the points, although
her serves were well-placed and
long rallies succeeded each one.

The Sophs had the serve in the
second, best two out of three con—
test, and they led off with two
points before giving up the serve to
'51. Again, they forged ahead to a
comfortable lend before the fresh-
men recovered themselves and be—
gan piling up the points. Trailing
12—3, the frosh started to overhaul
the weakening Soph team and
forng ahead to a 15-12 lead before
relinquishing the servo. Their ad-
vantage was short-lived. however,
as tho Sophs returned hard passes
to win the game: 21-15.

The victory in this event gurncrs
3 points for the Sophomore class.
Coming after the defeat of the men
by scores of 15-6 and 15—13 the riv—
alry score now stands at iii—9.

 State Bowlers

Take 3 Games
From Rensselaer

State’s bowling team moved into
third place in the intercollegiate
Bowling League by downing RPI in.
3 matches on Wednesday. Siena
maintained its league lead with a
2-1 win over Law, as Pharmacy
won 2 out of 3 from ABC.

Paced by “Diz” Dickinson’s 183,
the statesmen rolled to a 835-784
first game win. Vatsos’ 179 was
high for the Engineers in the open-
ing game. The 71-pin margin. was
the largest the State keglers rolled
for the three-game match.

Anchor Men Decide Final Game

In the middle match of the even-
ing, the Statesmen came out on top
with a 792-725 edge. Dickinson
again led the state representatives
with a 186 game. Coming into the
final game with a two-game edge,
the State bowlers gained a sweep
of the match by capping the final
game. The finale went right down
to the last frame as anchor men
Bob Reno and Cramer of RPI vied
for the edge. State's winning mar-
gin was an eight-pin edge. Dick-
inson's 560 was high triple for the
match.
