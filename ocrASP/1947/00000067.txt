Insurance Inquiries

Many inquiries have been re-
ceived by the Insurance Committee
in regard to the proper procedure
for the filing of insurance claims.
In answer to these inquiries, Don-
ald Lansky. '49. Chairman of the
committee, has outlined the proce-
dure.

If a policy holder is taken ill at
home and treated by his family
doctor, or any other doctor. he

should secure an itemized bill from .

him. Upon the student’svreturn to
school, he may obtain a claim blank
and an envelope, addressed to Ar-
thur R. Kapner. from the Medical
Office. located on the first floor 01‘
Husted. Within a week after mail-
ing the blank. he will receive a
check for his expenses.

The Insurance Committee has
announced that policies have been
distributed to some policy—holders.
Others will follow shortly. Any
State College students who have
further questions should contact
Lansky, through student mail. or

The =.end of Thanksgiving: vaca-
tion may mean back to a lot of
“toll and trouble" but~it also means
the opening of- the basketball and
winter 1 sports, season. As far as
basketball is concerned, it got off
to a big'bang with the varsity play-
ing three home games and Intra-
mural WAA and MAA leagues
starting practices. '

Winter sports ought to be getting
under way now that Jack Frost has
taken a permanent residence here
for the next few months. This nat-
urally brings up the point of where
such sports WIIi take place. In the
past, Washington Park has been
the center of what activity there
was in respect to skiing and skating.
Tsk, Tsk . . .

A few ski enthusiaststried to or-

ganize a groupat the beginning of ‘

the year to hire a bus and spend
weekends further north for the sole
purpose of skiing. Naturally such
a plan would arouse much criticism
and after several slanderous re-
marks about a co-ed weekend the
plans were dropped. If we are too
immature in mind and skill then
perhaps the hills in Washington
Park are high enough, but we be-
lieve “Ski Weekends" would defin-
itely add much to our winter sports.
program.

“Gay” Blades

Now let’s take a look at the skat-
ing situation. Most important is a
convenient location; one that a ma-
Jority of the students eould get to
without too much trouble and a
place that would always be in a
condition for use. As far as Wash-
ington Park goes we feel that it
fails in both respects. A satisfac-
tory solution lies in flooding the
field between the two dormitories.
Accessibility for students has been
demonstrated in the past by its
use for hockey, softball, volleyball,
etc, all of which have had excellent
turnouts. The main difficulty is
the first flooding but there is little
doubt that the good Fire Depart-
ment of Albany would come to our
rescue. Flooding the field semi-
weekly would thereafter be a sim-
ple matter.

The “rink” would offer excellent
opportunities for skating parties
plus a good foundation for the Win-
ter Carnival later on in the year.

The problem and the solution has
been presented, what we need now
is action!!! WAA. MAA attentionil

Food For Thought

section along on Varsity trips.

 

Come Out For Life Savingl

The announcement of senior life-
saving has been made by WAA cap-
tain, Ann Ethal. This sport will take
place on evenings and it is hoped
that it will start before Christmas
vacation. If enough girls sign up
on the WAA bulletin board the
date for the first meeting will be
set. Frosh especially, come out.

Varsity Defeats Alums
In Que-Sided Contest

Fresh from their so-sa‘ rout of ~

the Alumni, State’s Varsity basket-
bailers . are pointing for their inter-
collegiate opening games: .tonight
and tomorrow. Massachusetts State
Teachers will provide the competi-
tion tonight. Tomorrow evening
Plattsburg State invades Page. The
Jayvee squad faces Lipmann's to-
night at seven-thirty. Cage action
gets under way tomorrow evening
at six o’clock as the Frosh Jayvees
face the Skidmore J.V.’s At seven-
thirty the Jayvees meet Skidmore
followed by the Piattsburg-Varsity
clash.

Fer-sh High Scorer I

Sy Fersh, high for the evening
with 19 points, dunked in eight
points in the opening quarter to
give State a four-basket lead. In
the second period State increased
their lead six points and led at the
half, 31-27. The game turned into
a rout in the third period with
State on the long end of a 55-26
score. The teams played about on
even terms in the last period.

Tom O’Brien. second high with
nine points, and “Link” Marzello
turned in good floor games for
State. The Alum’s big gun was
Sam Raub, who dunked in two
field goals and six free throws.
Massachusetts New Foe

Facing the Massachusetts Teach-
ers, who are making their first ap--
pearance at State, will be a veteran
squad of Statesrnen. The opening
whistle will probably find “8y”
Fersh and Tom O‘Brien in the
front court, Jack Kirby in the cen-
ter slot and Walt Schick and Ken
George at the guard posts. Backing
up the starters to give State its
best reserve strength in some time
will be “Bas” Karpiak, Marv Lan-
sky, Lenny Coles. Dick Wheeler and
Link Marzello.

Face Northern Rivals

Moving into Page tomorrow even-
ing will be an improved squad of
cakers of Plattsburg state. State's
old rivals from Plattsburg bring an
entire new squad this year and will
be gunning to avenge their 51-43
and 69-52 losses to the statesmen
last year.

Slated to see picnty of action
with the State Cagers, who open

their intercollegiate season tonight.

against Mass. State. are two of last
year‘s veterans, Jack Kirby and
“Link” Marielle. '

John Kirby, who makes his home
in Remsen, is one of the two sen-
iors on the team. Jack Went to
Fredoniu State before coming to
State last year and also played var-
sity ball in High School. Standing
6'3" he is the biggest man on'the
squad. Jack usually plays the
"bucket" where his height serves
to best advantage.

Abraham L. Marzello was one of
the freshmen that played varsity
for State last year. “Link” comes
from Troy where he played feet-
ball, basketball and baseball for
Lansingburg High. He is 5’6" tall
and weighs 160 lbs. and more than
makes up for his lack of height by
his speed and skill in ball handling.

llVarsity Club" Formed

For State Lettermen

Before Christmas vacation, it is
expected that the constitution and
elections for a Varsity Club for
State College will be held. Formed
to promote interest and advance-
ment of intercollegiate athletics,
the club will not be a part of MAA.

An automatic invitation will be
tendered to all those State College
men who receive their Varsity "S."

The constitution. which is now
being written contains the provision
that, while it is not to be a direct
part of MAA, still it will assist
through publicity and by promoting
varsity athletics.
