Kisiel Releases
Plan To Remodel
Slate Commons

Plans for improving the Commons
of State College were released Wed-
nesday by Helen Kisiel. ‘48, Grand
Marsha]. The Administration has
agreed to paint the Commons and
the renovation will be made by
Campus Commission as soon as this
is done.

The Commission proposes to place
an absentee voting booth on the
balcony of the Commons that will
be in a permanent location and
designated accordingly. This desk
is also to be used for organizational
activities when it is not needed for
voting purposes.

Class banners will be arranged
on the wall so that the most recent
banner will always be nearest the
stairway. Further plans call for
the painting of cabinets which are
to be identified and grouped ac—
cording to the organizations that
use them.

The relocation of student mail—
boxes is also planned by the Com-
mission and if possible they will b
placed in a single line on the wall
in lower Draper where the organ-
ization boxes are now. If this can
be done the organization mail serv-
ice will be transferred to the Com-
mons.

Miss Kisiel also announced that
the walls of the Commons will be
decorated with murals and carica-
tures depicting the various activl-
tics and organizations of State Col-
lege. It is planned that art stu-
dents und all interested parties
shall paint the themes suggested
by the representatives of the or-
ganizations participating.

The Commission has recommend-
cd to Student Council that the stu-
dent body purchase additional
chairs and tables to replace those
that are broken or so far depreci-
utcd that they are unusable.

State Delegates

Jamcs Brophy. '49, and Heinz
Engel. '50. will leave Saturday. De-
ccmbcr l3. for Rochester. where
they will represent State College
at a regional convention to discuss
a National Student Association Con-
stitutlon.

This is the first time State has
been invited to send delegates to
the National Student Association)
Convention] and the purpose of their
attendance is to discuss an overall
constitution for all colleges in New
York State. The Alfred delegation
has submitted :1 draft constitution
which will be the main topic under
discussion.

This constitution will in no way
conflict with our own Student
son-lotion constitution. According to
Section Three of the proposed Al-
lrctl constitution. “the sole purpose
of the Ncw York State Nuiionul
Sludcnl Association shall be to
llllllt‘ lhc studans of New York

teen-piece orchestra, who will feat-
ure Fran Warren and Gene Wil-

Before World War II, the Christ-
mas ball was planned as an affair
sponsored exclusively by Inter-Frat-
ernity Council; at that time this
was a formal dance given the week
before Christmas. This year Inter-
SOrority Council decided that they
wished to join the fraternities in
producing a college-wide dance on
a larger scale than has ever been
attempted at State. This was the
way the idea originated for an Inter-
Sorority Ball.

Provide Initial Costs

Initial costs of the ball have been
provided by pledges from various
individuals and organizations. At
present an extensive publicity cam-
palgn is in progress, having result-
ed in articles in both Albany news-
papers, the Knickerbocker News
and the Times-Union, and also in
radio announcements.

Decorations in the Armory are to
be furnished by a professional dec-
orator from Cohoes. Other pro-
fessionals concerned are the photo-
graphers, one who will take photos
of couples who desire prints and
one from the Hague studio who
will take pictures for the Ped.
