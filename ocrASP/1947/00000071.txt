Christmas Party Succeeds,

Thanks To Well-Wishers

Think back, all you with that
“vacation’s-over” look, to the
second assembly before Christ-
mas and liberation. and you’ll
remember dropping your last
pieces of silver into the box pass-
ed among us for contributions
for the Christmas party given to
the kids at the Albany Home for
Children. Well, Myskania would
like to let you all know what a
big success this affair turned out
to be, thanks to your own gen-
erosity. co-operation on the part
of many students, and also to a
bit of the Christmas spirit re-
vealed by Albany merchants con-
tacted for refreshments.

Special recognition goes to
Paul Anast’s store, which con-
tributed fifty-four pounds of

candy absolutely free of charge,
and to Brook's Doughnut Store,
which donated one-half of all
the doughnuts purchased.

And in case you were wonder-
ing about the final resting place
of those odd nickels and dimes
that always turn up after such
affairs. the probable outcome,
says Myskania, will be their re—
turn to Smiles, the organization
responsible for such heart-

18 Seniors To Practice
In Six Area Schools
During Second Semester

A new plan for cadet teaching in
area schools will be introduced into
the English department next sem-
ester. Beginning in February, nine
English majors from the Senior
class will go as practice teachers
into the Watervliet, Bethlehem Cen-
tral, Roesselville. Voorheesville. Ra-
vena. and Coeyman’s high schools.
They will teach for eight weeks.

The plan will probably be expand-
ed to include at least three other
departments next fall, according to
Dr. Robert Frederick, Director of
Training, and a member of the
planning and adjustment commit-
tee. Other members of the com-
mittee are Dr. Watt Stewart, lPro-
fessor of History, and Dr. Harry
Hastings, Professor of English.

Cadet teachers will act as assist-
ants to a master teacher, a regular
teacher at the high school. They
will carry a full day's schedule and
responsibilities. After the eight
Weeks. the nine cadets will be re-
placed by other practice teachers.

To Receive Eight Hours Credit

Eight hours of credit are given
for the eight weeks. Special courses
and adjustments will be made in
the English and Social Studies de-
partments for those who will miss
school time. All departments are
cooperating.

Mary Elizabeth Conklin, Instruc-
tor ond Supervisor in English, will
act as field supervisor of the six
area schools, which have promised
fullest cooperation.

The tentative list of Seniors and
the schools at which they will teach
follows:

First eight weeks: Eugenia Bara-
iiowskl, Roesselviile; Eloise Worth,
Rocssclvlllc; Ruth Bessel, Voorhees-
villc; Dorothy Diffiii. Bethlehem
Central; Mary Fleming, Bethlehem
Central; Bette Jayne Jones, Water-
vlici; Gloria Gilbert. Watervliet;
Murjorie Lotz, Ravena; Jane Mc-
Guiiincss, Coeymans.

Muriel

Sccond eight weeks:

Beihlehcni Central; Mary Quinn,
Bethlehem Central; Hazel Engdahl,
Wiitcrvliet; Burburn Druschel, Wat-
crvlici; Cill‘Dl Clark, Ravens; Mary
liniiiett. Cocymans.

'l‘o Supplement Millie Program

The purpose of the program is
to supplement Milne practice teach-
ing by giving more practical experl~
cure, and to promote closer rela-
lions bctwccn State College and
the hiin schools of the state.

The present set up represents the
results of many years planning, but
is entirely expcrimcniul, explains
Dr Frederick. Althouin the pro-
gram will continue next year, it is
subject to many changes. Dr.
Frederick states, “The class of mill
is witnessing ii very significant de-
i’ciopincnt in the history of the
college, one for which We have long
been planning. The class of '48 can
be proud of the fact that it is the
class which inaugurated cadet
teaching in the high schools of the
stale."

Applications Are Available
For lnllrmary Fee Refund

Forms for making application for
refunds of Infirmary fees are now
available in Room 300 A. All those
students holding the new insurance
policies must make application be-
fore March lst. according to Nancy
