More Cooperation . . .

Committees are not formed to be ignored!
Yet, the general attitude around State seems
to be that committees were formed to be heckled
andthose on the committees are malicious characters
attempting to embezzle money from the surplus.

This year, two issues in particular have de-
manded committee work and when both commit-
tees presented their final reports to assembly after
months of hard work and investigation, other
plans, directly opposing theirs, were offered from
the floor. We are not trying to stifle free discus-
sion. Healthy discussions are the growth vitamins
of any organization but too many vitamins can
be dangerous.

If people have definite plans on the issues at
hand. why can’t they present them to the com-
mittee during the months they are working on
the problem? Why is it always so necessary to
wait until the committee appears before assembly
to drop these little bombshells?

The names of the members of these committees
are all announced in assembly and it would be an
easy matter to contact them. In case we should
forget the names, we do have a president for our
Student Association and she does keep a record
of such things. All ideas and suggestions are more
than welcome to these committees, but when ideas
aren’t expressed until the committee has finally
reported the results of their labors, they only serve
to antagonize and to postpone any action on the
problem in question.

The insurance question and the work on the
remodeling of the Commons brought the issue to a
head. Plans presented in assembly when these
questions were brought up only resulted in a post-
ponement of any definite action. Issues should be
discussed during the meetings but not to the point
where a whole new plan if suddenly thrown into the
laps of the student body and activities must cease
to discuss the new plan.

Much time and many rises in blood pressure
would be saved if such plans were presented to the
committees beforehand so they may investigate the
possibilities then. Committee members aren’t long-
haired orgies ready to spit in the eye of the first one
to venture a suggestion. Committees are formed
merely to organize work on a certain question. Any
student may offer plans.

In the future, what do you say we try to be a
little more considerate and instead of slamming a
committee’s work and offering a brand new plan,
consult the committee first. The committees formed
in Student Association work hard and sometimes
under handicaps. They deserve all the coopera-
tion we can give them.

"he Read, 71..., 3W1. . . 

Editor’s Note:

Many requests have been made
for some explanation of the theory
behind the preferential voting sys-
tem. We believe that student dis-
satisfaction with this system ex-
Ists because of the lack of under-
standing of Its fundamental prin-
ciples. In an attempt to clear up
misuderstanding, we are printing
the following explanation.

The preferential system we use
is essentially very simple, in spite
of what you may have heard. In an
election for a single office, like class
president, it is designed to enable
the class to vote on as many can-
didates as it may want to, and still
to put into ofice the one who act-
ually has the support of the class.

Whenever more than two people
are nominated for one office, it is
quite possible for no one candidate
to get. a majority right; away, i. e.
more than half of the votes. That is
what usually happens here. Of
course, we could declare the person
with a plurality elected, i. e. the
largest number of votes; but. that
would hardly be a democratic meth-
od. For example, in the recent Fresh-
man election, the largest. number of
votes obtained right; away by any
candidate for Secretary was 4'1 votes
out of 266.

Some way must be found which
gives a. clear-cut. majority to one of
the candidates. One method which
is commonly used, and was used
here once, provides for a. run-off
election between the two candidates
getting the highest number of votes.
In the run—off one of the two must.
get a majority. That. is quite true,
but. there is a serious fallacy in this
line of argument. The fallacy lies
in assuming that; one of the top two
will always get the support of a ma.-
jority before any of the other candi-
dates who have been eliminated in
the run-off. The example I have
cited before—the Freshman elec-
tion for Secretary—shows the utter
foolishness of this assumption. If
such a run-off had been held among
the top three or the top four, it
would have been mathematically
possible for either the third or
fourth candidate to receive a ma-
jority of the vote. Starting with the
run-offs at the top is therefore not
a. sound method.

Start At Bottom

If the solution does not lie in start-
lng the run-offs at the top, it. oh-
viously lies In starting at the bot.-
tom; that Is. In having a run-off
among all but the lowest candidate,
and in continuing to eliminate the
lowest candidates one by one in each
successive runoff. This can be done
very easily by marking just. one bal-
lot preferentially and taking care of
the run-offs In the count.

How and why is this done? If you
have voted for one out of a number
of candidates. you will naturally
‘\'ote for him again each time his
tiamc appears on the run-off ballot;
all the more so since there are fewer
and fewer other candidates compet-
Ing for your vote. Only when the
person you have voted for is clini—
inate do you have to switch your
support to one of the other candl—
datcs. You do this by indicating
a second choice on your original
ballot. Thus. as long as your first.
choice is still rtttmlng your vote
counts for him on each run-off,
called a distribution. When he is
eliminated because he has the small-
est number of votes, then you trans-
fer your vote to the one of the re-
tnainlug candidates whom you in-
vor. Should he. 111 turn. be elimin-
utcd. your next cltoicc ls considered,
and so on. All this is done stop by
step, or run-off by run-off, by those
who count the ballots. This idea is
called “the single transferable bill-
101“. That Is the prcfcretitlai's
term for a series of run-offs which
starts with all the candidates. con-
tinues by eliminating the lowest. can-
didates one by one and transferring
their ballots to the next choice mark-
ed on those ballots, and stops as
soon as one of the candidates either
has a minority or is the only one
left. In each rutuoff. or distribu-
tion. your Vote Is counted for that.
one of the candidates whom you pre-
fer to the others still running.

In this manner the preferential
system determines with complete
accuracy and without. the slightest
opportunity for flnagllng which one
of the candidates can most. readily

get the support of the majority of
the voters. _
Explain Multiple Elections

We now come to elections like
those for Student Council in which
more than one office must be filled
from one list of candidates. In this
case, the voting system used dependl‘
entirely on the general objective of
the election. The present voting
system was set up with this objec-
tive—to provide for representation
of all sections of class opinion in
proportion to the strength of those
sections within the class. By this
way it; is hoped that a Student
Council truly representative of the
four classes can be obtained. If you
agree with the objective, the pres-
ent. voting system follows easily.

When several people are to be
elected, they obviously cannot all
get. a majority of the votes. There-
fore, a number of votes must: be
found which four and only four of
the candidates can get. This num-
ber is called a quote. For one office
It is one more than half the votes;
for two, one more than a. third; for
three, one more than a fourth; for
four, one more than a fifth; or. the
number of votes divided by one
more than the number of offices to
be filled plus one. When 300 vote
for 4 class representatives the quota
ls therefore 61. Notice 4 times 61
equals 244; the last candidate de-
feated can get only 56 votes. If you
lower the quota to 60, five candidates
can be elected.

Once a quota has been set. the
ballots are counted in essentially the
same way as for one office. The low-
est candidates are eliminated one
by one until four candidates have
the quota or only four are left. Since
the sum of the quotas is 244, almost.
everyone In the class contributes to
the election of a Council member.
Furthermore, half of the class elects
half the representatives, one quar-
ter elects one quarter and smaller
groups have their scattered votes
concentrated on one candidate in
the run-offs. This is the idea called
proportional representation or PR.
Distribution of Surplus

The only real complication lies in
the question of what is called a
surplus. It. might happen that some-
one gets more than 61 votes or what.-
ever the quota happens to be. For
example, in last. year’s election for
Student Council, the Class of '49
gave 133 out of 256 first choices to
one candidate. This excess over the
quota. called a. surplus, must. be
distributed somehow if the other
candidates are to be able to get a
quota also, and if large numbers of
ballots are not; to be wasted. Form-
erly, we distributed the surplus by
taking the excess ballots off thc
top of the candidate’s pile and re—
distributing them according to the
next choice marked on those ballots.
This method is evidently not» tnuch
good.

Quite aside of the temptation to
help your friends by taking the
"right" ballots, it is absolutely Im-
possible to select ballots completely
representative of the candidate's
\vhoic pile. It is therefore necessary
to redistribute all the ballots but at
a lower value, Thus, under the pres—
ent system, if your vote ls marked
for a candidate who needs ottly
11, lUths of the votes he, receives, you
will give him 0 Wills of your ballot
and the other I 10111 to your second
choice. In this way the element of
chance, introduced by the selection
of only some of the ballots for count-
lng. and Iortncriy decisive in about
half of our elections. Is eliminated.

At all times. your ballot is fully
counted.
Elimination of Candidates

In the multiple election, there—

fore, yottr ballot. goes to your first
choice as long as he is runttlng and
to the extent that he needs it. If
be Is eliminated, your ballot goes
to yottr second choice; tf he docs not
need all of your ballot. llt‘ gets what
he. needs and 1110 rest. goes to your
second choice. The same procedure
is used If a candidate gets a surplus
after one of the other candidaies
been elltumutcd in a run-off.
Splits In Surplus Distribution
When ballots are split In a surplus
distribution very cumbersome frac-
tions may be produced. For example.
in last year’s election for Myskania,
one candidate had a. surplus of 30
votes out of 163. That. would mean
splitting each of those 163 votes into
two parts-—one of 133/168 for the

Since this is the first issue of the New Year, it is
customary to list our own resolutions and make a
much longer list; of resolutions which other people
should keep. It. is always good to have a certain
time to stop, look briefly back, and take a few min-
utes to reflect on accomplishments and failures, the
happy and the unhappy moments, with a view toward
improvement. However, we have never believed in
hard and fast resolutions, but merely think It is bet-
ter to do what; is believed to be right. as seen at the
time. with no apologies. We quote the translation of
the proverb We learned this week in German class:
"The road to Hell is paved with good resolutions.”
Since no one would pay any attention to the resolu-
tions anyhow, space may as Well be conserved.

New Practice Teaching Set-up

 

 

We've heard both pro and con criticism of the new
full time teaching deal. While it will undoubtedly
prove invaluable to the student. the complaint has
arisen that; its will, from a practical viewpoint, cause
quite some inconvenience and monetary outlay for
the people concerned. Carfare adds up, and seniors
who hold student; offices will be seriously handicapped
in the performance of their duties. Maybe these com-
plaints can be straightened out. when the plan begins
operation.

A Freshman Speaks

Since sometimes a newcomer will see many things
an older resident; has become so accustomed that he
is blind to them, we have asked a freshmen to give
his impressions of State College. It follows:

Commission Members

To Assemble Monday

State officials, contacted by the
NEWS last Wednesday, declined to
comment on the New York State
University Commission’s recom-
mendations affecting the Teachers’
Colleges of New York. Oswald D.
Heck, Speaker,of the State Assem-
bly and Commission member, ex-
plained that all information rela-
tive to the findings of the Com-
mission is withheld by a gentlemen’s
agreement and could only be re-
leased by the body as a Whole.

Recommend Colleges Be Cut

The research staff of the Univer-
sity Commission, according to the
N. Y. Times, recommended that the
eleven teacher training colleges be
cut to a half a dozen and that; the
enrollment of those six be doubled.
Also proposed was that Albany
State College be enlarged to facili-
tate the training of elementary
teachers and possibly students go-
ing into government; work.

Commission to Convene

The two-year-old commission will
convene here in Albany on January
12 to adopt final recommendations
to submit to the State legislature.
Confronting them is the task of
deciding between two drafts on pro-
grams to be initiated in higher edu—
cation.

The original draft submitted to
the Commission concerned the es-
tablishment of numerous commu-
nity colleges throughout New York
State. John E. Burton. State Bud~
get Director, feeling that “undue
emphasis" was being placed on
community colleges, presented an
alternative draft to the Commission.
This draft presented a four-point
program as follows: Acquisition of
an existing university by the state,
extension of financial aid to medi—
cal schools. enlarged scholarships
thw York State has for years
granted 4.000 scholarshipsI, and
state aided community colleges '—
manag'cd and Initiated locally.

Among the objections is that
either recomtncttdation. if accepted
by the state. will add an expense
of hundreds of millions to an al—
ready $750,000.0(10 state budget.
There is also Ihc question of fitting
the proposed plum. Into the present

State.

Fewer Teachers

It. is important that all Seniors
and Graduate students come to the
bureau of Teacher Placement in
Milne, in order to indicate their
preference for being employed as
Elementary or High School teach-
ers. According to a communication
received from the office of Elmer
G. Mathews. Director of Student
Employment, the SEB expects to
receive numerous demands for all
kinds of teachers trained in ele-
mentary school work.

The communication reads as fol-
lows: "There has been an increas-
ing demand over the past two years
for teachers in the elementary and
junior high levels and this year
seems to be no exception. Now that
the state has a salary law which
has increased the benefits to most
teachers the chance of making a
reasonable salary in the lower
grades of the public schools has be-
come state-wide.

The war babies are beginning to
show their numbers in our schools
and the superintendents and prin-
cipals are hard pressed to meet the
demand with qualified personnel.
These fields hold promise of brisk
development and advancement for
those who are qualified and wish to
participate."
