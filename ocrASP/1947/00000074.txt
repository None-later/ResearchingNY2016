elected candidate and one of 30/163
for each second choice. To avoid
such complications, each bal-
lot is made equal ot 100 points. In
this case that meant that 81.33
points from each ballot were re-
tained by the elected candidate while
the voter could give 18 points to his
second choice. Since no ballot value
can be created, fractions of a sur-
plus point are always omitted. This
loss does not affect the election as
long as a small number of offices is
being filled. In the Myskunia elec-
tion used as an exmnple here. the
average loss per ballot was .001672.
Thus, you get proportional repre-
sentation correct. to all intents and

that it does not guarantee intelligent
voting. That is your job. Your in-
telligcnt or unintelligent voting will
give you mtclligcnt or unintelligent
results correct to two decimal places.

A final word to those who may be
running for office sometime. Often
in recent years candidates have
claimed that some other candidate
had found a way to beat the sys~
tem. Don‘t worry. Under this sys-
tem. more is no mysterious way of
marking or not marking one ballot
which makes it count more effec-
tively than any other ballot. These
who believe they have found an
opening for finagling nrc fooling
uoiihcr you nor the system, but
themselves.

Mark your preferences carefully in
exactly the order in which you con~
sider the candidates. If that is what
you put into the ballot box. that is
what will come out.
