Post-Exam Hysteria Threatens
As Students Mob Instructors

For the information of those
who are in doubt. the cafeteria
line has not extended from third
floor Draper to the supervisors
offices in Milne—those crowds
of Stockingless Seniors and hys-
terical underclassmen are looking
for greater rewards than a mere
pickle and peanut butter sand-
wich. They were merely trying
to discover if they received the
credit points which would keep
them off the “D” list.

The lines began to form early
Tuesday morning. Students leap-
ed hysterically over piles of pa-
per, blocking the offices of the
professors, only to find a shell of
the man who, but two weeks ago,
looked normal, healthy and hap-

i

Some students left triumphant-
ly, some dejectedly, some grab-
bed ll stack of about 100 papers
and threw them in the profes—
sor‘s face. but most hastened to
Dean Nelson to reqnesc changes
in the administration.

“Speedy Recovery" cards may
be secured in the Registrar's of-
fice and forwarded to the Dean,
O/O Pougiikeepsie State Hospi-
tiil.

Stote To Acquire New Dorm Cottages On Western Ave.;

Plans For Site Of State-Owned Dormitory Near Completion

Hordes of new students descen-
ding upon State College each sein—
ester have created a problem-—
where are they going to live? A
solution to this enigma is now be—
ing evolved by the. Alumni As—
sociation with the cooperation of
the State Dormitory Authority.

li‘ive houses. located at 293, 295,
297-0, 303 and 307 Western Avenue,
are being purchased by the College.
to be used as additional women's
housing for immediate use during
the housing shortage and high col—
lege enrollment. There is a pos—
sibility that one of these build—
ings \\‘lli be utilized as a dorm for
graduate women students. At pre-
sent these buildings are still oc—
cupied by the tenants, but the deed
to one iNo. lltlili has been obtained,
and liltii building will be i'eiiiodel-
ed for use as ll dorm as soon as
possible. The. acquisisition of the
other buildings is expected to fol-
low shortly, although the eviction
of the tenants of all of the build-
ings may cause some delay.

Since these houses are only toni-

porary housing, however, the really
important project is the new State
dorm and recreation hall which will
be biillt on this site sometime in
the future. Upperelassmen will re-
member last. year’s lengthy dis-
cussions of these projects; they
might be interested to note that
these plans are still in operation
and are heading toward fulfillment.

At present, however, there is
some difficulty in the completion
of plans tor the building, due to a
dispute over the proposed site be-
tween Ontario iiiid Partridge
Streets, backing lieVerwyck Park.

According to Dr. John M. Say-
ies, former President of the College,
the Authority and the Alumni As-
sociation have. not come to terms
on the price of the land. despite
six months of discussion. (The A5-
sociation owns the land, together
with Pierce mid Saylcs halls.) The
difficulty has occurred in the trans-
action of the property from the

hands of the Association to those
of the Authority. ,

"As I niiderstaiid it," Dr. Sayles
stated, "the state thinks We should
give the Authority the land. We
feel the state should pay for it
and we have asked what We be-
lieve is ii reasonable sum."

"We paid for the bind and we
would like to use proceeds from
selling it to help liquidate the
debt on our present dormitories,"
Dr. Sayies explained.

When some decision is reached
by the two orgnniaiitions, work
will begin on the contract, and the
plans then will go forward to com-
pietioii. Progress in dormitory
erection elsewhere in the state has
resulted in buildings near the con-
tract siiigc at Genes-w, Fredonia
and Oiiconta State Teachers' 001-
leges. The dormitories are being
built under a 1044 law permitting
the eight-nine State Dormitory
Authority to go ahead with the
puojcct and liquidate the costs
through rental charges.
