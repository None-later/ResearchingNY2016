Says New Student From. England

By SHIRLEY WILTSE

From New Castle-on-Tyne, Eng-
land, has come an addition to the
student body of State Teachers' Col-
lege. She is Miss Jean Sherlock, ex-
teacher of German and French in
England.

Jean came to State to take her
Master’s degree in French. Her B.A.
in Modern Languages she took at
Kings College (The University of
Durham). In line with the English
system, she got her degree in three
years, and then studied a year for
her teaching diploma.

Before coming to America, Miss
Sherlock taught French and German
for three years, two of them in a
co-ed high school, and one in a
girl's school at Ripon in Yorkshire.

A year ago, she gave up teaching,
took a business course, and went to
Switzerland to work. It took several
months and much red tape to clear
the way for her studies in the
“States”.

After a rough trip on the “Queen
Elizabeth”, her reactions to New
York City were varied. In her own
Words, “I am quite overcome by New
York, buildings, cars, shops, traf-
fic! Times Square and Broadway are
unbelievable.”

With Albany, the ‘hostel’ (dorm)
and State College, Miss Sherlock is
greatly impressed. She is surprised
because so many houses here are
made of wood, for in England they
are mostly made of brick or stone.
She admires the traffic management
and system of road clearance.

“And the food," she exclaimed.

 

To Plan Murals For Commons

Helen Kisiel '48. Grand Marshall,
has announced that a meeting will
be held in the Commons at 3:30 p.
in. Wednesday, for all organization
heads or representatives to discuss
plans for murals and caricatures for
the Commons. Reassignment of desk
space in the Commons will also be
discussed.

“After what We get at” home! We are
very strictly rationed, and have less
of many things than we had during
the war. Clothing coupons must last
for a longer time, no ‘petrol’ is al-
lowed for private use, and cigarettes
are almost one dollar per pack.”

Miss Sherlock likes the dorm, the
girls, the school. In short, she is glad
she came.

Gigantic Years

the men. The war was on and the
Red Devils with Baker leading were
out for their quotas. We gave nearly
as many warnings to the class of
'50 as Dean Nelson gave to the Class
of '49.

Activities Day we sailed into the
fray and '50's candidates for Mys-
kania grew, as did our treasury.
Then came Campus Day and we
printed '49 on the cup once more—
with only two more banner hunts
ahead. Fifty gave us a tough fight
in football and hockey, while we
saved our strength for pushball.

At the Soph banquet we gathered
enough spirits and cheer to bring a
circus to State a month later. And
what a big-8 that was ill Remem-
ber, that was the night that Wilcox
brought Broadway to Page.

We marched into Moving—Up Day
with Lisker as our president. (We
took elections as well as banner
hunts in our stride.) This was the
climax of our days in rivalry and we
came in victorious, with two cups to
our credit.

With rivalry behind us we are
settling down, but not to oblivion,
for it is our job to initiate our
green sisters and brothers.

Now we are out for another vic-
tory—this time to prove that Junior
Week-end can still be a tradition.

[mum 

ay naornv and SEAMAN

 

This week we Junior members of
the Sports Staff of your NEWS wish
to speak our piece on a few of the
sports activities here at State.
Therefore. with pen in hand (or ra-
"vwn-iter in tow we set forth
our, ,lccd opinions as follows:

The .arsity bowlers have quietly
and inauspiciously rolled themselves
into top brackets in the Inter-colle-
giate bowling league. The aggres—
sive squad refused to let a poor
start in league competition throw
them off their game, and have
moved into the league first division
by steady bowling and an even bet-
ter spirit. Wednesday evening is
their bowling night, beginning at
9 o’clock. Any night you would like
to see the State team in action drop
in at the Playdium.

Coming Attraction

The Varsity basketball squad sees
its first post-exam action tomor-
row night as they meet the Oswego
Teachers there. With three wins in
their first seven games, the squad
could round out a successful season

by taking the remaining seven
games.
Let’s all get behind the team!

Heard that line before? Well, it's
worth repeating. The squad is do—
ing its part, let's do ours. Tentative
plans are being made to charter a
bus for the North Adams-State
game in March. It promises to be
a good game and one that you won’t
want to miss. Our suggestion is that
you start saving those pennies and
reserve Sat. March 5th for the trip.
Watch the bulletin board and this
column for further details.

While we are on the subject of
team support, we want to put in a
plug for all those loyal fans that
have done such a terrific job of
backing the team thus far. The
cheerleaders report that the cheer—
ing this year has been right up to
par. And since this is Junior issue
we can't help but mention the hit
the '49 Fight Song has made at the
games so far.

More About '49

Speaking of '49 naturally leads us
to multi other athletic data, about
that Class. Remember when they
came. to State? They took the Cum-
pus Day events without an effort
from the Class of ‘48. and who can
forget the push-bull game last year
when the '49crs fought their way
to a bloody victory? Or the girls’
basketball triumph and the l‘cllow's
softball victory.

We could rumble on for the length
of this column about the laurels of
the Class of '49, but since We are
dclcrmlned to bring to light as many
sports as possible, we move on to
other things.

WAA Plans
Junior Weekend
Winter Sports

In connection with the Junior
Weekend, WAA will conduct their
annual winter carnival this week-
end. Activities will commence with
a figurine contest tomorrow morn-
ing. The afternoon will feature
skating, skiing and tobaggoning.
Group houses have been invited to
enter the figurine contest which
will close at 2:00 p. in. when Ear-
line Thompson ’50, chairman of
WAA winter sports, and members
of WAA Council, the judges of the
contest, will make their rounds.

Last year Farrell House won
first prize with a penguin and ig-
loo exhibit. Gamma Kappa Phi
was second and Kappa Delta Rho
third.

After the morning events on Page
Hall Field all winter enthusiasts
may adjourn to Washington Park
for the sports of pond (frozen) and
slope. The feature event of the day
will be an athletic struggle between
the sophomores and the class of
'51. This tilt will be entirely in
keeping with the spirit of the sea-
son.

Last year WAA held an entire
weekend which began on Friday
evening with a sleighride and an
informal dance in the Commons.
On Staurday Washington Park was
the scene for the traditional win—
ter snow sports following the mom-
ing contest on Page Hall Field. In
the evening formalized couples at-
tended the “Snowbnll,” an elabor-
ately decorated affair with a snow-
man in the middle and Marty Bort-
nick, ‘49', crowned “King of Win-
ter.“

This year the college calendar
was too crowded for the presen-
tation of two long,r weekends. There-
fore WAA is combining their tal-
ents with those of the Junior Class
by taking over the sports side for
the occasion.

J.V.’s vs. Siena
Tuesday Night

to their credit since vacation, the
State J. Vs encounter the Siena
Frosh Tuesday night at the Armory.
This will be the second meeting of
