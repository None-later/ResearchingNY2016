_ “The purpose of this organization is to offer the
students and faculty of New York State College
for Teachers a newspaper, efficient and unbiased,
which Will present them each week with the latest
news inside and outside of college which will be of
interest to them.” -

- Theseare the principles upon which the NEWS
. was, founded and these are the principles which we,
the present NEWS staff, are striving to maintain.

.Today in assembly the voting committee will
present its report to Student Association. One of
the items in the report reads something like this:
Election commission is entitled to one-eighth of
the space of all budget financed publications for
the two week period during spring elections to pub-
licize election news, and one-eighth of the “news”
space during the week of. freshmen elections in the
fall.

As things stand now and as has been the policy
in previous years, the NEWS Board has published
election news both before and after the actual elec-
tion, using its own discretion as to what and how
much should be printed. Past NEWS Boards and
the present one have tried to maintain a rigid im-
partiality, being certain to list all names alpha-
betically, or by classes, and allotting equal amounts
of space to each candidate.

Now the question has arisen as to what might
happen should a NEWS Board at some future date
decide not to publish election news. That there
'should be rules to cover such an instance, we agree.
That a commission outside the NEWS staff be dele-
gated power to censor what goes into such issues,
we disagree. We maintain that the final say on
what is printed in the newspaper should be left to
.the discretion of the NEWS Board.

We will concede that the NEWS Board is not an
infallible body any more so than election commis-
sion. However we do try to the best of our abili-
ties to present unprejudiced views to the student
body. Many times in our striving for impartiality,
we have been accused of refusing to take a stand
on definite issues.

It is true that at some future date we may have
an excessively inefficient NEWS Board but have we
any guarantee that election commission will not
also suffer correspondingly lean years? A provision
merely requiring the publication of election news
and results would insure Student Association of
publicity of these events and still leave NEWS
Board in charge of the selection of the items.

The NEWS has had a free press for over thirty
years. We believe we will accomplish tnore good
for the students in general by retaining this free
press. However, the final decision rests with you,
our readers. We have stated our beliefs. Our future
policy will be determined by the decision of Sin-
dent Association.

An egg was laid this Week—and it
was the audience who laid it. Ad-
vanced dramatics, who has worked
long and hard, was undeserving of
the reception it got. When actors
on a college stage get flustered by
cat-calls from the gallery, it’s no
longer amusing. It becomes a case
for Emily Post.

In the past, criticisms have been
leveled at the types of plays pre-
sented, and yet, when Sincere effort
is put forth to present a mature
drama, it is received in an insult-
ing and Juvenile manner. It's about
time we realized that “hell” and
“damn” are oft-quoted words on the
stage and not a completely shock-
ing display of profanity. The audi-
ble “gasps”, "ooh’s" and “ah's”
would seem to indicate that the
majority of Tuesday night specta-
tors Were witnessing their first stage
clinch. It seems a shame to think
that in the future a director might
be tempted to fine-comb his play
in order to insure its proper re-
ception. It’s about time We grew up.
This is a college, not a high school.

The first production of the eve-
ning was an adaptation of a form-
er Broadway success and was di-

n! meme, moan

_——————

rected by Fred Baron. Mr. Baron,
a little nervbus and unsure of him-
self in the beginning, turned in a
convincing performance. Gifford
Wingate, true to form, gave a gen-
uinely appealing presentation as
the young fighter and was ably as-
sisted by the characterizations creat-
ed by Arthur Collins, Tom Lisker
and Harry Mills. Tink Wittpenn,
somewhat stiff at tlrnes, did Well in
a difficult role. The fault' does not
seem to rest with the performers,
but rather that the scenes presented
appeared to be a series of climaxes
that started at too high a pitch and
did not allow the audience to build
up to a final point at the end.

The bad lighting and awkward
timing of the production directed by
Betsy Franks, must be attributed to
an accident that forced a last min-
ute restaging of the play. Joe Cru-
cilla proved his ability to handle
the lead although at times it was
felt that he gave too full sway to his
emotions.

One cannot help but feel that the
dramatists were at a definite dis-
advantage this week. I am sure that
A. D. will agree that in the future
it could do very well without the
“visitors” with the spitballs in the
balcony.

Quarter to eight, fifteen minutes
to go. I dash madly between the
john and my room. Drat! Now I
can't find the soap. This is awful,
how can I go out on a heavy date
when my face isn’t clean? Is it on
the desk under my Poli Sci book?
No. Aha, there it is, peacefully rest—
ing on an ashtray. Must’ve left it
there when I went down to borrow
Flo's dress. It's a nice dress, hope I
don't spill beer all over it.

“You go to my head like the

The radio must be psychic, or else
how would it have known that’s
what always comes to my head
when I see that man? God, That
Man will be here in twelve minutes,
and here I am, half naked, look-
ing something less than charming.
It’s this girdle that's slowing me
down. Who was it that said, “Ga-
ther unto yourself that which is
your own.” He should know it’s not
always so easy. What the heck,
when I dither into that dress and
call up rc-inforcements of Tabu I’ll
slay him, I tell you, slay him. That's
stupid. How can I slay him when
I don't even know what to say to
him. Dr. Anthony, I have a prob—

one is nuts about, especially when
he's so witty, so charming, so . . .

"Drop dead."

“Thanks, dear, I‘ll take good care
of them." 'l‘hc hell i will. She's
lucky if she ever sees them again.
But. I mustn't bc unkind to poor
Roommate. she's bitter. She does—
II‘t have a date.

you wouldn’t get so completely drunk
so frequently you might have a

That nasty little clock says it's

is bloody where I've been beating

The house phone rings. I clever-
ly trip Roommate so that she falls
gracefully over the typewriter case,
and beat out nosy Margie by a care-
fuly-powdered nose.

"Hello?"

"This is the girl on desk. You
have a caller.”

“Thanks, I'll be right down."

A final glance in the mirror. Kid,
you’re dynamite, even if you don’t
have a fuse. With control remark-
able in one so young, I cut the gallop
to a casual stroll.

Like Eisenhower, I set forth to

Lust week-end State hcld its Jun-

THE CHANGING TIMES?

While glancing through some issues of the STATE
COLLEGE NEWS of the early thirties recently, a
topic was noticed which is discussed as much today
as then. This topic, as an aptly entitled editorial
of a 1930 issue, is “Actives vs. Passives”. The answer
to the question, “What’s wrong with State College?”
is often given as being the fact that there are too
many passives in school. This particular editorial
goes on to quote figures to Show that most of Signum
Laudis was on the active list, thus supposedly prov-
ing that inactivity was not the result of excessive
study, though we’ve usually observed that the people
on Signum Laudis don’t have to spend as much time
on studies as do ordinary mortals;

Be that as it may, it’s a good subject for debate.
Take our college elections, for example. In spite of
the degree of mechanical perfection devised for the
voting system, there will still be poor voting because
of the general lack of interest.

This is true also even for some of the office holders.
Every spring some candidates are nominated who,
while they would like the office and sincerely believe
that they can fill the job as well as anyone, don’t
fully realize the amount of work and time required.
Comes the next year and the job is neglected. While
this is perfectly understandable, it is still too bad.
We don’t know the remedy, because We’re guilty orn—
selves. But it's something to think about.

We think we have it tough

In the same issue, the editor was complaining that
only four page issues could be put out because of
lack of revenue due to the fact that cigarette ad-
vertisements could not be published. A far cry from
last week when free cigarettes were handed out to
students.

You can still get them

It has been noticed that copies of the “Nation” and
“Soviet Russia Today” have been removed from the
library shelves. A note on the former reposing place
of “The Nation" informs the would-be reader that it
may be obtained at the desk.

 

Credit for last week's NEWS belongs entirely to
the Junior editors. They should be congratulated for
the well laid out and general excellence of the Junior
ssue.

We like SCT

Too many people have been panning dear old State
College lately, belittling it in comparison with other
colleges and we don’t like it because we do like State
College. It may not be perfect but it’s better than
a lot of others we‘ve had contact with. For a general,
all-’round education it. can’t be beat, and remember,
that the next time someone looks down his nose at
teachers' colleges. And the students. They may not
all be perfect either, but as a group we’d match them
With any comparable group of any college of any
type. And we’ve found here a much larger percent~
age of people that we sincerely like and with whom
we would like to become and remain 010se friends,
titan in any other group. That above all is the strong-
est point of SCT—lts students. They may be passives
and not give a hang about how anyone is elected
president or even if there is one, but nevertheless
they're real people. And remember that when any-
one starts panning our school,

Loyalty is the product of sincerity, and these are
two of the finest qualities in mankind. So let's be
loyal. to our friends, and so to our school. And let's
not just be passively loyal, but actively proclaim we
think our school to be the best. And if anyone does-
n'L think so, let him depart to the place he thinks to
be better.

Rah, rah, ray, ray,

Hip, hip, sway, swaytl

The foregoing is just an attempt
to set the scene (loosely speaking)
for a few lines about the way the
Varsity Cheerleaders are chosen.
This has nothing to do with the
present cheerleaders with whom we
are more than satlsifled. As a mat-
ter of fact the method to be out-
lined came as a suggestion from
one of the cheerleaders.

 

 

 

 

In the past the girls are nomina-
ted from the floor of the assembly
and then voted on by the entire stu-
dent body. The four nominees with
the greatest number of votes be-
comes the varsity cheering squad.
With the nominating and electing
in the hands of the studnt body,
the whole affair turns out to be a
popularity contest with the stu-
dents voting'not thinking of the
squad as a whole but only of the
individual members. Granted the
girls are skilled but so are the chor-
us line fems. Yet it is very seldom
that we see a conglamerated chor-
us line with girls of various heights
and sizes tunless a few of them
happen to be related to the di-
rector).

Now that we've torn down the
present system here's something
that might be done about, it as
suggested by some members of the
WAA council and one of the cheer-
leaders.

Cheerleadlng would become a reg-
ular WAA sport. There would be
tryouts in the Fall for-those attempt
ing to get 10 hours credit as re—
quired for other sports. Of the
girls receiving credit 6 would be
chosen before the varsity basketball
season begins. At the end of the
second fall only three would be se-
lected. The three teachers and the
new cheerleaders would comprise
the squad for the following season.

The persons to do the selecting
would Inost likely be the president
of WAA and MAA, Miss Johnston
and Coach Hathaway.

WAA Basketeers
Enter Second Round

On Wednesday evening, Febru-
ary 11th, the first games of the sec-
ond round of the W. A. A. basket-
ball schedulc was played in the Page
Hall gym.

In the first game of the even-
ing Kappa Delta emerged victor—
ious over Beta Zeta by a close
score of l4-9.

The second tilt found Saytlco
Hall displaying their high-scoring
powor to trounce a five-girl North
Hall team: 25-4.

Phi Delta, after a slow start,
came out over Pierce Hall: 24-16,
with Pat Tilden scoring 18 points
for the Greek letter girls.

The Commuters floored a five-
girl team and were trounced by a
strong Gamma Kap team: 30-9, led
by twelve point scorer Mary Cooper

These games are the start of the
second round in a new system spon-
sored by the Womcns' Athletic
Association. The first round was
two leagues in action. in the dorm-
itory league Pierce came in first
with six wins and no losses; Say—
lcs came through with a record of
5 and l, losing only to Pierce. In
third place came the Commuters
and North Hall also placcd. This
eliminated Wren l-Iull, Newman Hall

Purple 8: Gold Drops
First Contest, 55-39

After dropping a 55-39 decision
to Oswego last Saturday, State will
endeavor to break its four-game
losing streak tomorrow night at
Page Hall. OsWego Teachers will
be the opponent again, following
a preliminary game between the
Junior Varsity and the Delhi Ag-
gies.

State jumped off to an early
lead, heading Oswego 9-7 at the
end of the first period. In the sec-
ond quarter the home team out-
scored the !Purple and Gold by
five points and took the lead at
half time, 17—14.

State faltered in the second half,
Oswego increasing their margin by
37-25 at the end of the third period.
The home team finished strongly,
outscm'ing State 18-12 in the last
quarter and took the game.

Kenny George sank five field go-
als and two foul points. Fersh and
Tom O‘Brien notched nine apiece
for the runner-up honors.

Statesmcn Ready

Tomorrow night’s game should be
a toss—up in spite of last. Saturday‘s
score. The Varsity missed more
than a week's practice during ex-
ams and should be in much better
shape for tomorrow nights con—
test than they were last Saturday.
Also, State will have the advantage
of playing on their home court.

Paul Caret, Mal Fallech, Jim
Worden, and Dave Wetherby have
been practicing with the Varsity
this week and may see action to-
morrow. There are several vacancies
on the Varsity, due to the recent
withdrawals of Basil Karpiak and
Dick Wheeler. Carter and Wether-
by saw some action in last Sat-
urday's game.

leap Year "Open Season
Begins Al Valentine Dance

Beware, brother, beware when you
go to tomorrow night’s Valentine
Dance in the Lounge: remember
this is Leap Year. W. A. A. is spon-
soring the event after the State-
Oswego game.

The best thing about the dance
is the cost, thirty-five cents for
couples and tWenty cents for stags.
They're serving refreshments, so
even if you got two left feet, come
around and eat anyway.

Believe it or not, all the coeds
(yea-even the freshmen) can stay
out until 1230. They say it snowed
in Miami this week, too.

Incidently, the fellows from Os-
wego's team have been invited to
stay for the dance. Remember,
don't carry hospitality too far. On
the other hand, if we lose, assault
and battery carries a minimum
sentence of sixty days. But it’s
okay: we predict State by three
points. And We pride ourselves on
the fact that we have never been
wrong yet. Joke!

 

Potter's Varsity Takes
Lead In "A" League

On Thursday, February 5th, the
Potter Club Varsity stretched their
winning streak to four games to
take over undisputed possession of
first place in the “A” League. In
the first game of the evening the
Potter Club Gents handed K. D. R.
their first defeat of the season with
the short end of a 30-21 score.
Bortnick Scores

In the Potter Club-St. Mary’s
Angels encounter Marty Bortnick
tossed in twenty-two counters while
George Glenday put through seven
for the losers. In the early game
Jim Hines, with fourteen points,
was high while Al Stone tossed in
eleven for K. D. R. The third game
was forfeited by Potter Club to
Van Derzee Hall.

Finks Defeat S. L. S.

Monday nights contests saw the
Potter Club Finks trim S. L. S. by
a 33-21 count with Ken Ludlam high
for the Finks with fourteen points;
and Dick Wheeler and Chuck Chase
each counting for five for S. L. S.
The Beavers flooring a four man
team took the measure of the
Shamrocks, 47-28. The loss of their
fourth man in the fourth quarter
did not deter the Beavers, paced by
George Lampman's 25 points. Ger-
ry Griffin and Ash Berton each
chipped in 8 for the losers. The
third game of this trio was forfeit
with the Screeps repeating their
Monday night performance; this
time the Carpetbaggers reaping
the benefits.

With the Potter Club
holding first place in the
League. the Ramblers round out
the standings by holding the “B”
League.
