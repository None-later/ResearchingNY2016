I _ night at Page Hall, 49-41. Although

tomorrow night’s game with St.
Michael’s has been cancelled, the
Junior Varsity will play the Union
frosh. There will also be a pre-
liminary game.

State found it tough getting
started against Oswego last Satur-
day. Oswego led 16-7 at the end of
the first quarter and increased their
lead to 30-14 at the half.

Statesman Finish Strong

In the third period the Purple
and Gold began to find the range.
The score at the end of that period
was 40-26. In the last period the
Statesman really turned on the heat
to outscore their rivals by six points
and make the final score 49-41.

 

 

 
 
  
   
 

offered for rivalry basketball. The
girls' division games will be played
on Wednesday, February 25th, and
Thursday. February 26th, as will the
men‘s play-offs.

The Wednesday games will find
the-men leading off at 7:15 with
the women‘s contest to be played
immediately afterwards. On Thurs-
day night, the women will start the
play with the men’s game to follow.

The women’s games will be rCf-
ereed by Miss Edith Cosgrave of
Columbia Central School who has
an All-American rating, while Mary
Quinn '48, will umpire.

Although the starting line-ups

are confident and are looking for-
ward to the games with great hopes.

Coaching the teams are Ben-

Jackson of the Sophs and Paul
Carter is mentor of the frosh. Both
coaches are looking forward to stiff
drills over the week end to get their
squads in shape. The starting
teams have not been picked as yet.
On Saturday the “Green Gremlins"
will hold their major practice. Early
next week the two teams will hold
their last practices, after which the
starting line-ups will be announced.

The coaches seem to think that
they have an equal chance to take
the game. Paul Carter says via Bob
Baker '51, “We‘ll Kill 'em.” Ben
Jackson notifies us that the Sophs,
“are confident, but somewhat han-
dicapped by the ineligibility of the
J.V. and Varsity members."
