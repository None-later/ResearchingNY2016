GroWin'g is just as much a part of existance as
stagnation is of death, for when you stop growing
' you’re on the decline. The trend at State College

‘_f§lia”§j__definitely been one of expansion, for we’ve

gone'a long ways in just the past two or three years.

V mWitnes's the; development of organizations like IGC,
'  Forum, and Primer, as well as the religious groups.

f Those already imbedded here as a part of tradi-
1 tion haVe kept pace with the trend in development.

' I'- Music Council has furthered the work of the chorus

ridglee club; D. and A. has brought back with
'fewedvigor the pre-war activities in cooperation
with Advanced 'Dramatics; and one has only to look

-  at the Commons to find the effects of Campus

‘olyrtrrivissiph’s work. To complete this picture, we
have liOpes of seeing the academic facilities almost
doubled within a few years. The future seems very

 ‘ bright.

This is going to impose an obligation on the
students to keep pace with the trend, however, for
,the minute we stop growing, stagnation is immi-
nent. Are we willing to pay the price of growth?

 'we will have to answer that question
., jh‘enthe budget comes up for discussion. It is dif-
.~.ficult, to put in terms of money, such an idealistic
“picture as “the future,” but we’ve got to face re-
f Lality. How much do we want State College to con-
}:tinue this present trend? We may have the op-
: portunity to reduce the student tax fee, since the
lrInfirmary fund no longer exists . . . or we may have
reliance to leave it as it stands now. We should
‘xeep ih"'mind, however, the fact that we will not
due able to depend on the surplus for additional
ri‘ftindsrinztthe future, since the Infirmary fund has
7‘si‘tp’pliedI' the largest percentage of income to the
ffs'urpiu‘s in the past. That fund is now cut off.
, If we’re going to give our organizations the tools
"(to work with so that they can expand, we’ve got
Ei-tod'ecide now. This is the time when we must
f‘_,}‘face the issue . . . Growth or stagnation?

in czlt~~is true, as students in a progressively inclined

,' lj'college, we should be able to accept the Tuesday
' 5 evening performances with a mature attitude, and

V ‘ appreciate the deeper significance of the plays. But

v when the audience finds that suggestive dialogue
is getting to be a regular occurrence on Tuesday

 evening rather than an exception to the rule, there

is bound to be some comment. To date, it has been

  to the effect that audiences are immature and in-
' considerate. Bttt does the fault lie entirely with the

 
  

  

1 audience? Perhaps we have failed to consider the
impression this has made on students within the
college. A good percentage of the audience on
Tuesday evening is composed of freshmen, less
than a year out of high school. How does that
effect them? We’ve been very fortunate in escap-
ing censorship. The plays that have been really
good, have not been mutilated, but unless a more
careful choice is made in the future, the Tuesday
evening audiences are not going to have the chance
to display their broadmindedness.

1 Tuesday Night Triumph

 

If the star of Harvey may be said
to be a rabbit, unseen and unheard,
it is equally true that the star of
John Lubey’s Tuesday- night pro-
duction was his set; and as anyone
in the_ audience will tell you, it
spoke for itself. It’s richness, soli-
dity, and novelty decidedly merited
the round of applause accorded it
at the opening of the curtain.

The second surprise of the eve-
ning followed almost immediately
upon the first: Gloria Jaffer, it be-
came apparent, had adopted a new
voice, Although at moments the
shrill, quavering tones suggested the
ladies of Arsenic and Old Lace, and
although it seemed incongruous that
so tiny a voice should proceed from
Miss Jaffer’s tall frame, she de-
served a curtain call for her consis-
tency and her honest endeavor to
present a characterization precisely
distinct from anything she has pre-
viously done. Fred Baron’s role,
while convincingly played, was un-
fortunately similar to that of two
weeks ago; the portrayal suffered
slightly from a tendency to mug-
ging and an uncomfortably strained
note in his voice. While the other
roles were definitely subordinate,
John Keefe turned in an easy and
amiable performance, as did Bob
Lynch. The final speech of the play
seems, in retrospect, rather flat,
but I daresay the fault law more

with the playwright than with Paul
Barselou, whose case on the stage
is always impressive.

Lacking the interest of decor, the
second play was forced to rely upon
acting; that such reliance was not
misplaced was ably proved by Stuart
Campbell’s cast. In spite of a line
missed here and there, the acting
in the second play surpassed that
in the first. Liberated at last from
the two or three line bits he usually
is handed, Arthur Russell turned in
a consistent and credible character-
ization, properly restrained. A heav-
ier make-up might have aided him
in overcoming the impression of
youth which inevitably associates
itself with his slight physique, but
everything which an actor could do,
by way of bodily movement, carriage
and voice. Mr. Russell had done. A
pleasant restraint was demonstrated,
too, by Ellen Fay, who has, in the
past, tended to overact her roles. Of
the other performers, Asher Borton
was the most convincingly Irish,
with Betsy Franks a very close sec-
ond. Stuart Goldman’s words were
occasionally lost, whether due to
the brogue or to the usual Page Hall
acoustics, it would be difficult to
say. The entire cast is to be con-
gratulated on the consistency and
amazing clarity of the Irish dialect,
a difficult and rarely so well realized
task.

O'BRIEN

Guest Columnist

“Stew” Dent stepped out into the
merry stream of scholars flowing
through the lower hall of Richard-
son and eventually found himself
flushed out in Page Hall, where all
were assembling for assembly. Bear-
ing the dignity befitting true schol-
ars of higher learning. they solemn-
ly filed into the spacious auditorium
chanting "Up You Go to Your Teak-
WOod Tower”, with a counter-melody
of “We’ll Kick 'em and Bruise 'em
and Spit on Their Nasty Little
Heads” blending in with ecstatic
harmony.

After the alma mater, a little
blond gh'l climbed up on the stage
and hid behind a big black box, upon
which she proceeded to hammer vig-
orously. At first Stew though she
must be caught inside and was try-
ing to break her way out. Hazel Har-
piac, sitting across the aisle from
Stew must have thought the same
thing because the louder the little
girl pounded, the louder Hazel
laughed.

From behind her big black box‘.
the little girl introduced the per-
son, who introduced the person, who
introduced the principle speaker for
the day. Stew’s tiny heart jumped
up into his sinuses with glee when
he found that the gathering was to
be blessed with the eminent world
traveler, lecturer, and contortionist,
Minny Mussels, of whom naturally
all the students had never heard.
Her timely topic was "Building Bet-
ter Bodies by Backflipping in the
Belgian Congo". She began her de-
lightful dissertation by explaining
how her backflip exercises might
be employed by “the future teach-
ers" to straighten all vertebracs
twisted on the trambouline. The en-
raptured audience, eager to learn
new ways of self-destruction, com-
picter ignored her. Ignor Raimus
burrowed his pea—sized head in the
News; Lou De Cruss, the veteran,
drawtng on his experiences in the
Congo refuted the lecturer's asset'-
tion that the Ubangi were much
more adept at the Burping Backflip
than were the Aborigcnes; Mona
Logg sat back and listened to her-
self talk, while Hazel Harpiac tuned
in Moscow on the Stromberg- Carl-
son which she kept strapped on her
back.

When Miss Mussels mentioned the
cannibals, Stew suddenly became
aware of the fact that he hadn‘t
had a bite to eat in six weeks, and
was a trifle hungry. But one glance
down the aisle at the empty seat of
his old friends, Ghoe Tubull, quiet-
ed him down considerably.

lecture by Whiediddi, the magician,
and since he would have been un-
able to keep up his studies with out
that prerequisite, the administration
had no other choice than to cast him
into exterior darkness.

Several times during the lecture,
Stew was aroused from his slumber
to fill out preferential ballots for
such things as Counselor for the
Keeper of Campus Commission’s
Keys, Most Obnoxious of ’52 (to be
based on hideousness and sorority
alone), and candidate for the 1954
issue of “Who Cares”. Since Stew
was unfamiliar with all of the can-
didates, he voted euphonically.

Miss Mussels was such an inter-
esting speaker that it only seemed
like three hours had passed when a
great ovation indicated she had
ceased her mumbling. From within
the big box the little blond girl
could again be heard hammering
away, It was now time to decide the
issue of the day: Would the stu-
dents of NYSCT spend $5,364.65 for
wallpaper in the men’s lavatory, or
would they spend $5,364. '75 for an-
other type with little igloo designs.
Phil Ibuster claimed it was an ex-
travagance since igloos were out
of season six months of the year;
but Loe Kwayshus argued that it
would greatly improve the mental
health of the male enrollment, and
ended his speech by saying, “Noth-
ing—even wallpaper with igloos, is
too good for our grand old alma-
mater, NYSCT". This brought the
loyal student body to their feet,
cheering and wiggling their ears in
wild approval.

By this time Stow was ready to
leave, but. there were several hun-
dred announcements yet to be made »
One girl remarkably disguised her-
self as an eiephont to advertise an
intersororlty tea; another gurgled.
giggled, and hummed her way
through six choruses of “Take Me
Out to the WAA Weeny Roast".

‘At long last, after a swing ver-
sion of the national anthem, the
program was completed, and the stti~
dents began to file out in logical
disorder, with those farthest from
the exits walking on the heads of
those in front of them. Many im-
patient oncs tried various ingeni-
ous methods of escape, such as
crawling under the seats on their
stomachs, swinging out through the
back window via the stage curtains,
and chopping a tunnel through to
the gymnasium. All were very eager
to gain the sanctity of the Commons

This Reporter is given “the widest latitude as author
of this column, although his viewpoints do not neces-
sarily reﬂect those of the Srm COLLIN)! News.

What was it George Washington said about the best
preparation for war being the preparation for peace?
But, sonny, it doesn’t look as though people are lis-
tening to G. W. these days—why, once upon a time . . .

PARADOX

. . and it wasn’t very long ago, when an assembly
speaker spoke on the internationalistic theme—love
me, love my dogma—and the papers are usually just
devoted to U. N. principles BUT last week, Mr. Marine
Officer told us that we'd better start getting our com-
missions so that when the war comes, we'd be nice and
“comfy.” Student reaction was, generally speaking:

1. Laughter (or general rejection)

2. Crying (or general hysteria)

3. Speechless (or general indifference or shock)

4. “Well?” (general acceptance)

A fellow just doesn’t known what to think . . .
PRE-DIGESTED WISDOM?

One professor in a, class last Week announced: “A
standard of living determines the degree of happiness
of a people."—Ah, the low, the poor, the “have-not”
nations are doomed, then, to the neurosis of the manic~
depressive. We always thought that it was a point to
take into consideration BUT as at determining factor!
Tchl Tchl Even Emerson knew better!

CLARIFICATION, PLEASE!

Last week, in Assembly, the Student Association (I
use the term freely—well, there was a quorum) voted
to continue to have a campaign speech for Grand
Marshal. Perhaps the issue has been missed entirely.
Certainly, if the student body in its entirety is to
ELECT the grand marshal, this group should hear
an election speech. BUT should the grand marshal
be chosen by the student association? To advocates of
the present system, I direct the following questions to
clarify the situation:

I—Do you really believe that Student Association is

qualified to vote?
a—Do we know how long the candidates spent
in approving posters, filling the coke-ma-
chine, and mimeo-graphing?
b—Do we know how efficiently or inefficiently
these tasks have been carried out?

Why, then, do we vote? Do you not feel that Campus
Commission itself is better qualified to make this se-
lection? After all, it is not different from what is
being done in the other campus organizations—the
fact that your organization is more “widely-spread"
makes the aforementioned only more valid. “A word
to the wise . . . ”

OF MAJOR IMPORTANCE

State College has a Major-Minor office plan to
distribute collegiate positions more democratically.
Did you know that:

1. SPEAKER of FORUM is a minor position, while
Commuter’s Club president is a Major office. (Cast-
ing no reflection on the validity of the Commuters’
Club position.)

2. That if you feel an officer is not doing a job well,
Provision has been made for impeachment (Con-
stitution—Section 5 . . . h-3) for failure to fulfill
adequately the duties of the office.

SEEING IS BELIEVING
Suggestion: Since there are usually only several

candidates for presidency of Student Association,

would it not be practical to let each candidate direct

ONE assembly program before voting takes place? A

preview always proves valuable.

“MONEY IS THE ROOT 0F . , . ”

It has been announced that organization budgets
for 1948-49 are due March 5. Perhaps, we need an
explanation of terms: l-A budget is not something
that can effectively be composed the night before the
deadline. 2-Certainly, it is impossible to know exactly
how much money you will need, but surely a close
approximation cart be made. 3—Check your budget
lines. Make sure that they are broken down efficiently
to enable expediency in handling funds. 4~—Ii‘, because
of unfortunate circumstances, your budget does not
meet your needs adequately, you have the privilege of

might say that the additional appropriations for this

Through the fervent effort of sev-
eral members of MAA we have fin-
ally obtained a bus to take gals and
fellas to the Varsity game at North
Adams.

When We say a bus, we mean one
and only one, so if you’re eager for a
ride make sure you get that ticket
early next Wednesday. There is now
a sign up sheet on the MAA bulle-
tin board and all who wish to go to
the game on the bus should sign up.
The cost per person will be $1.35
round trip for the bus and admis-
sion to the game will be approxim-
ately 50 cents.

The bus will leave at 4:30 pm. and
should return before 1 am. but
if not, the Dean of Women has
okayed it, and the uomen will not
be campused for the rest of their
natural lives!

Written permission should be ob-
tained by the women from home
just in case of “delayed explosions."
Everyone who goes is expected to
carry their student tax tickets.

Remember there are only 35 seats
so get in there and get your seat
yearly. . . .

Communique From the Front

What’s wrong with rivalry? Can
it be that the women aren’t interest-
ed and the men are too old or don‘t
the frosh and Sophs have class spir-
it and pride? Those few members
of both classes who did show up for
rivalry basketball games saw good
games but the cheering was “sad”
on all sides. It was a good thing
that the sister classes attended and
participated in the cheering, so that
the teams could have some backing.
Why so many of the Sophs left after
the boys played Wednesday night
still remains a question in my mind?

Rivalry isn't over yet! Many points
have yet to be awarded . . . let’s
have some real “old fashioned" at-
tendance, Gremlins and Jays, to
Show the school you can do it!

morrow for a game with Hartwick
at Hartwick. The statesmen return
home Tuesday night to play Massa-
chusetts State (Fitchburg) at Page

Varsity vs. Utica

Thursday, February 19th, State
dropped a free-scoring contest to
Utica, 92-73. Utica took a 18-12 lead
in the first quarter and increased
it to 42-22 at half time. The Var-
sity got rolling in the third quarter
to decrease Utica’s lead to six
points and make the score 65-51.
Utica started hitting again in the
fourth and took the game.

Kenny George ran wild for State
notching 23 points on eleven field
goals and one foul shot. “Sy” Fersh
took second honors with 16 points.
Six men in the Utica line-up hit
the double figures. Martiniak was
high with eighteen.

J.V.‘s played an inspired ball game
and tied it up 57-57 at the end of
regulation time. Five men were out
on fouls at this point. Union was
able to come out of a hectic over-
time period two points on top.

Bill Dunn, Jim Warden, and 'Paul
Carter were high for the Jayvees
with 15, 13 and 12 points respec-
tively. Davis and Fanbel paced
Union. Union won the game from
the foul line, State outscoring their
rivals from the field.

Myskania Takes A Licking
As Frosh Take First Win

The Majestic Myskania fell
victim to the might of ’51 on
Tuesday last in a contest of
skill and stamina. The frosh
girls, paced by nine points toss-
ed in by Ellie Rociewicz, easily
overcame the scintillating Sen-
lors.

Leading at the half by a safe
margin of 14-6, the frosh sub-
stituted a second team and the
Mighty Mates took heart. Worth
shifted to forward, in order to
make passes, and rode-a-Shap-
iro for a dashing attempt at two
points.

Mitch admiration must be ac-
corded the grappling guards
whose praises are never sung
loudly enough. “Tickling” Scoop
Gilbert was cheered loudly from
the bench and if she committed
every foul in the book, at least
she didn’t shoot for the wrong
basket. Moans and groans could
be heard from the Myskanla
bench where battling Ann May
recovered from the rigors of
war and a cut lip.

We don't want to say that our
revered Madame President is
small, but, Myskania played ten
tninutes with four forwards be
fore the refs noticed her.

Coach Williams- strictly en-
forced training rules and no
smoking was allowed between
the quarters. Trainer Bill “dump
’em in from over the top" Bald—
win was only slightly more effi-
cient at throwing in the towel.

By the way, the score was
30-12.

 

Pierce Eliminates KD,
Retains Unbeaten Spot

One more team was eliminated in
the WAA Bowling Tournament this
Week while Pierce Hall maintained
its no loss lead. Kappa Delta,
bowing to the Sayles Hall squad,
was dropped from the league.

In games bowled on Tuesday,
February 24th, Phi Delta and the
Newman five tied. each taking one
game. The third game in the series

4 was not rolled off. This third game

will decide which of these two Learns
will be eliminated from the league
competition as both Phi Delta and
Newman have lost three games.
Team Standings

Thus far in league matches,
Pierce Hall has alone maintained a
no loss record while Psi Gamma and
Gamma Kappa have both dropped
one. Phi Delta, Newman, Wren,
Sayles, and South, each with three
losses, face elimination from the
league if one more match is lost.

The Wren Hall team was not
dropped from the league as report-
ed in last week's NEWS. Thus far,
Chi Sig and Kappa Delta are the
only two teams eliminated.
League Announcement

Angie Ricci ‘48, Captain of WAA
Bowling, has announced that team

first basketball games for rivalry
points. On Wednesday, in Page ‘

up a hotly contested 50-49 decision

to pull up on them. The last min-
ute and one half of play saw the

the flophs at any time.
