' ' Competition For $3000

ZTThe Tamiment Social and Eco-
nomic Institute is offering a first

. prize of a thousand dollars with ad-
ditional awards totaling two thou-

, sand dollars to college students sub-
mitting the best 5000 to 6000 word es-
says on “An American Program for
World Peace in the Present Crisis"
to its second annual contest.

The contest is open to all under-

graduate college students in recog-
nized colleges of the United States.
Entry blanks may be obtained on
request from the Tamiment Social
and Economic Institute, '7 East 15th
Street, New York 3, New York.
;'According to Louis Waldman,
Chairman of the Institute's Essay
Committee, the purpose of the award
is to “stimulate college students to
constructive thought on matters of
social and economic importance.”
Mr. Waldman points out that it is
their desire to have college students
realize the necessity of having a
point of view. The response to the
first contest held last year on "Roads
to Industrial Peace” was proof that
today the student is interested in
the social and economic world prob-
lems.
’ The prizes for this contest include
first prize $1000; second prize
3500; two third prizes, each $250;
ten fourth prizes, each $100. The
closing date of the contest is April
23, 1948. -*

HUnt Addresses
Social Studies
Teachers Group

“Facts are a means to an end, and
though I respect facts I believe that
too much emphasis is placed on
textbook information that is never
Used or remembered”, stated Dr. Erl-
ing Hunt, Chairman of the Depart-
ment of ‘ Social Studies Teaching,
Teachers College, Columbia Univer-
sity. Dr. Hunt was addressing the
Capital District Association of So-
cial Studies Teachers at a meet-
ing held last Tuesday at State Col-
lege. V

The address entitled "What’s
Wrong With The Teaching of So-
cial Studies?" stressed the need for
definite action that must be made in
the educational field. Particularly
emphasized was the gap that exists
between the high school graduate
and his attainment of full political
rights. Active community partici-
pation was suggested as one remedy.

Another outstanding point made
by Dr. Hunt was the need for un-
biased presentation in school text
books. As an example he cited a re-
port made by the American Council
on Education. After a study of
American textbooks on South Amer-
ica they concluded that in many
instances Latin-American Culture
was looked down upon and misin-
formation was predominate . . .

Features Men’s Glee Club;

“College of the Empire State,
mother of . . .” No, it wasn’t an
Assembly program at which
these words were sung; this
time the audience was a radio
audience and the only assembly
was that of the kids at the Al-
bany Home as SMILES spon-
sored their broadcast from the
Home last Wednesday.

State’s musical capabilities
were revealed under the leader-
ship of Mr. Karl Peterson, In-
structor of Music, as the Men’s
Glee Club, the “Choralettes” (a
special voice group) and Tink
Witt Penn presented their speci-
alities. The Men’s Glee Club
opened with State’s Alma Mater
and then sang “Stout-Hearted
Men,” “Stars of the Summer
Night” and, appropriately,
“Winter Song.” “Quiet” issued
forth from the Choralettes, who
also ended the program with
"Begin the Beguine." Miss Witt
Penn's solo was “Singing Vine.”

During the program Charlie
Miller told of the work of
SMILES at State and urged
other colleges to follow our ex-
ample.

the future, in order that in case
unoihcr nccidcut occurs, the organ-

named as the most likely candidate
for President by the student body in
a poll taken by the State College
NEWS this week. Harold Stassen,
however, will receive the most num-
ber of votes from the students of
voting age. The questions asked of
the students Were: “Who do you
think will be the next president?”,
and “Whom would you like to see
elected?”. The tabulation of results
is as follows:

State Shows Republican Tendency

It appears that State’s Republican
tendencies have not changed. Only
once in the twenty years that polls
have been conducted at State, has
a Democratic candidate for Presi-
dent been favored by the student
body. This was one of the ﬁve times
that Roosevelt was voted upon at
the college.

 

State to Broadcast
Debate With RPI
Over WHAZ

Two debates, one of which will
be broadcast, are scheduled by De-
butc Council for this week, accord-
ing to Rita Shapiro ’48, President
Lac-.11 colleges R. P. I. and Union
will be the oponcnts in the dis-
cussions.

Monday evening from 7:30 to
8 pm. a debate will be broad-
cast over Station WHAZ between
R. P. I. and State College. The
topic will be, "Resolved, that a
systcm of socialized medicine
should be established in the United
States." Patricia Spencer ‘49, and
Mary Alice chu '50, will present
the negative for State; R. P. I.
will take the affirmative. Each
speaker will make a three minute
«pouch, after which the meeting
will be opened to discussion from
the uudicnco and contestants.

Wednesday evening a round
table discussion is planned to bc—
glu in thc Lounge at 7:30 p.
The topic will bc. “Rcsoh'cd. that

Choose Republican ’28

In 1928, the college chose Republi-
can Albert Ottinger 2-1 over Frank-
lin D. Roosevelt for Governor of
New York. Roosevelt won the State

election, however. The student vot- '

ners gave Herbert Hoover a 2-1 ma-

jority over Roosevelt in 1932, but-

Roosevelt came through in the elec-
tion with a landslide vote.

State favored the Republican side
again in 1940 when Willkie was fa-
vored by a 17 vote majority. They
remained Republican in 1944 when
Dewey received a 25 vote edge on
Roosevelt.

It is evident that elections at
State have very little bearing on
the national election and that the
results of this poll would forecast a
defeat for Dewey since the polls in
previous years have almost invaria-
bly acted as negative indicators.

Offer Opinions

Some deﬁnite opinion was of—
fered; some unusual opinion was of-
fered, and some opinions indicated
that the choice does not lie with
anyone now apparently in the run-
ning. The following statements are
indicative of this:

Mary Earle ’51—“Dewey should be
elected because he is young, has
new ideas and has the faith of the
public.”

Sparky Vaughn '50—"My choice
is Vandenburg‘h because he is the
most capable man in a position to
run.“

Audrey Koch ‘50 ~— “A dark
horse will get it and my guess is
Eric Johnston.”

James Cafaro ’50—“Errol Flynn
will win if all his children vote for
him.”

Nancy Mowbray ‘49—"Dean Nel-
son is the man for the job".

Betty Hutton ’50—“Dutch Schul=
tze”.

Council Writes
Protest letter

To N. Y. Bureau

As :1 result of the dissatisfaction
shown by the student body in re-
gard to the performance of Eddie
Dowling lust Friday night in Page
Hull, Dramatics and Arts Council
has written to the Columbia. Lec-
till'c Burcnu expressing their dis-
pleasure.

In this letter, according to Cath-
criuc Douuclly '40. ’I‘rcusurer, the

- Council slulcd that thcy did not

fool the pcrformuucc lived up to the
wrich and verbal agreements the
Burcuu mode at the time the con-
iru-ct was signed in May of last
ycur. The Council does not feel that
the inflow of the lecture was due
to Mr. Dowling but. rather to the
misrcprcsrniulion of tho Lecture
liurcuu. This is the first time. that
this burr-nu has ever proved un-
suilsi‘uctm'v lo Stutc College.

The letter also stated that. unless
soniclhing was done to compensate
for tho financial loss of the Dra-
muiics uiul Arts Council they would
be forch to discontinue their busi-
ness rrlullonshlp with the company.

Students, Treasurers Speculate,
"Who Pays Veterans’ Dues?”

Around the State College
campus, the question of the
week is: “Who's paying the
veterans’ class dues?” Class
treasurers say that due to a
recent ruling of the Veterans
Administration, the veterans
must pay the dues themselves.
Yet, the vets know little, if any-
thing, about the situation.
Many of them claim that the
VA has paid them in the past
and would presumably pay
them now. However, class treas-
urers are getting worried. The
Sophomore class has already
allocated money that they ex-
pected from the VA but now,
due to the recent ruling, the
class will go into the red unless
the veterans pay out of their
own pocket.

Clarification of this situa-
tion as to the why and what
may come later, but at the
present time all student
veterans are held responsible for
class dues. Those who have
not paid their dues should con-
tact their class treasurer and
see just where they stand.
