the script at more than one meet-
ing. The two girls who sing “But-

soon grew wary ‘of being pushed by
the captain into the arms of Dick

always get caught. Mr. Petersen,
directing the lead singers, ﬁlled in
all missing parts from soprano to

siaa... . State Defeats Fitchburg; 1
Season To  Tomorrow

 

_____.By JACK norm

The Varsity rings down the cur-
tain on their ’47-‘48 campaign with
their ﬁnal two games this week-
end. To date the Statesman have
copped ﬁve of their thirteen con-
tests. Not an enviable record to be
sure, but certainly a far cry from
our mediocre ’46-'47 season.

Starting off with wins over No.
Adams State, Plattsburg and Mid-
dlebury, the Purple and Gold hit the
skids and dropped seVen in a row.
What threw this ‘winning combina-
tion into a terrific slump all of a
sudden is the $64 question. Tougher
competition? Probably. For the
schedule was geared to ease the Ca-
gers into their harder games, as all
schedules should be. But whatever
the cause, the Hamilton game mark-
ed the beginning of the slump.
MORE "ABOUT HAMILTON

First of all, Jim Coles missed the
bus for Clinton and three regulars
got the “rider’s Cramp’s" and were
unable to play much at all. The
squad got off the bus and went
right into the game with practically
no warm-up.

All this added up to a hectic show-
ing and a forty point loss to Ham—
ilton_lAnd the losing streak followed.
Our point is that it takes only one
series" of bum breaks to throw a
winning combo ihto the doldrums
of an extended string of losses.
snoox‘ JINK TUESDAY

Whatever the bugaboo was. the
Varsity shook it Tuesday in the
Fltchburgh tilt. The Statesman
clicked for their long-sought after,
slump-breaking win. And they did
it handily, winning 70-56. Tonight
and tomolrow. the Cngers will be
out to make it three straight before
closing shr‘p. And North Adams and
Utica better be at their best. For
the statesmen have found them-
selves.
