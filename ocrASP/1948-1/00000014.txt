t , eint ose

Upon invitation from the Soci-
ology Club of the College of Saint
Rose,-a group of Inter-Group Coun-
cil members went to the college
Wednesday night to discuss inter-
group relations. John Jennings '49,
acted as general chairman for the

State College group. About thirty
people attended the discussion.

Give secial Distance Test

Barbara Smith, President of the
Sociology Club, called, the meeting
to order, after which Peter and
June Youmans ’50. gave both the
State College group and the Saint
Rose group a Social Distance test.
This test is similar to the one which
was' given to the sociology classes
here at State- last year. The results

‘ were compared to last year's test

results and they were found to be
both favorable and similar. The
group broke up into a panel dis-
cussion, the title of which was
“Spheres of Activity in Modern
Group Relations." Joy Simon ’49,
was the first speaker of the evening.
Her topic was “Personal Responsi-
bility" through which she pointed
out that until you understand your-_
self you cannot objectively or skill-
fully understand inter-group prob-
lems. Molly Mulligan ’50, was the
next speaker. addressing the stu-
dents on racial problems in employ-
ment. Pat Devlin ’49, then spoke
on inter-group problems in edu-
cation and discussed strategies used
to cope with them. She also dis-
cussed the Quota System and prac-
tices applicable to classroom usage.
Concluding the program John Jen-
nings discussed the Ives—Quinn
Bill, concerning discrimination in
employment.

To Present Panel Discussion

As a result of Wednesday's dis-
cussion, it was decided that two
Saint Rose delegates would go to
the Troy Y. M. C. A. next Wednes-
day with a group of Inter-Group
Council members to take part in a
panel discussion with high school
students. They will use the direct
process method which presents a
problem in a semi-dramatic form
and, allow for a stop at the cli-
matic point in action to ask indi-
viduals their reactions.
Begin Work On Seminar

A group of Saint Rose students
will work on a seminar and Com-
munity Project headed by Bob
Haidt ’48, and Molly Mulligan '50.
The seminar will include a study of
the problems of the Clinton Square
section. Members working on this
project will go down for personal
interviews and come back to dis-
cusa their findings, working into
the Community Service Program.

Snowbolls, Mittens Reiiim
To Coinpur As Spring Exile
“If winter cometh, can spr-
ing be far behind?” seemed a
little far fetched this week.

These students who were de-
veloping a good case of spring

fervor saw their shadows and

went back in the moulding for
a few more months. The fresh
green shoots of young grass
that were rearing their beauti-
ful heads, quickly disappeared
.under a blanket of that very

common white stuff. Boots.
mufflers, mittens, anti-freeze,
Ired flannels . 'which had

not seen use for at least three
days, were dragged out respec-
tively.

Snow ball bombardments of
the “Milne Students Revenge”
returned in full swing in front
of Albany High. (NOTE: Prac-
tice teachers please exit through
the back door of Draper.)

Student morale fell with the
snow ' . but, cheer upi——you
may get to wear your Easter
outfit yet. (Well, at least the
Long Islanders will.)
