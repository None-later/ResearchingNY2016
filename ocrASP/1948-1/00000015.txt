Frankly Speaking . . .

This is a year of changes for State and for the
world. MacArthur said he would run for Presi-
dent; Dewey took a stand last week; an outside
auditor is auditing the books of Student Associa-
tion; there will be no infirmary fund next semes-
ter. Everybody is making changes—everybody ex-
cept Press Bureau, that is. Yes, they’re still in the
same rut of disorganization. '

They started out with a hang with the Who’s
Who “election”. Not only was the election NOT a
success, but the entire contest was illegal in that
the names of those elected were not supposed to be
disclosed until after approval was given to them
by the central authority of Who’s Who. A mere
triﬁlei .

Next in line is the Junior Prom Queen. Oh, yes,
photographers were called to take a picture the
night of Junior Prom, photographers from the local
newspaper who are few and must cover such unim-
portant things as murders, accidents, and ﬁres in
preference to OUR Junior Prom. Eventually, the
Wednesday after the Prom, a picture was sent to
the local paper. Naturally, no paper wants to print
anything quite so stale as that.

Before looking over the Constitution, we thought
perhaps the members were fulﬁlling their obliga-
tion to the Student Association by merely sending
out notices to hometown papers. The purpose of
the Bureau, and we quote from the organization
constitution, is: “To publicize activities of students
of the college and the college itself in newspapers
throughout New York State with the view in mind
of placing New York State College for Teachers in
the ranks of major higher education institutions.”
After reading this we erased our former thoughts
and took a pessimistic view of the matter.

Obviously, the Bureau has not fulﬁlled its pur-
pose, and if any publicity has appeared in the
local papers, we would like to acknowledge that it
was due to the new Co-ordinator of Field Services
and Public Relations. No, the papers will not
print news if items are sent in the morning of the
day they are to be published.

Certainly there is a lack of leadership and good
judgment when one person counts the ballots from
an election by herself with the help of no one,
regardless of the fact that the constitution desig-
nates as a duty of the director “to count all ballots.”
What a faux pas when a member of Student Asso—
ciation releases such false and damaging informa-
tion to the local papers as “SCT Who’s Who Vote
Illegal; Too Late To Act.” But is it all the fault
of one person? In talking with a group of Board
members, we discovered that about four or five
members were actually working for the Bureau.
Words to the effect that the Constitution was not
read to them at the beginning of the year as it was
supposed to have been, so they did not know their
duties, were the main excuses. We were privileged
to read the Constitution, and we assure you, it didn’t
take much effort or exertion. Anyone with a little
initiative could have obtained and read it, if not
through Press Bureau itself, then through Student
Council.

Granted leadership is not at its best, but it cer-
tainly shows a lack of co-operation, a lack of spirit,
and a lack of common sense to permit an organiza-
tion which could be so important and could do so
nurch more than it has done for State, to become
so defunct, to disintegrate so entirely. There is still
a very important part of the school year left. There
is still time to pull together the broken strands
and make a solid chain.

Leader, if you do not deem yourself capable, you
have an out. Board members, if you cannot or will
not do your job, you also have an out. You are
all responsible. Look within yourselves. Are you
going to let Press Bureau‘s pants get too big for
it, or are you going to burst their seams? if. you
do not step lively, someone else will do it for you
and you will be nonexistent-extinct.

Mal/tea Qua“

(Revised Edition)

 

By ARLIENE RIBER

Guest Columnist

Once upon a time

There was a country—far away,
Where everything was peaceful
And the people all were gay.

They lived behind a tall stone wall

That was as high as it was wide,

And they often walked right up to
the edge,

But they never looked outside.

Back in the hills of this happy land,
In a swamp you could hardly see,
There was a scary little man

Who lived in a hollow tree.

He sat in the mire all day and all
night

And polished little tin toys.

An‘d he'd laugh and chuckle and
jump with glee,

And make some awful noise.

Late one night, when it was very
dark,

He left his spooky nook.

He quietly climbed the bleak grey
wall

And cautiously took a look.

He saw a great and big new world

And people by the score.

And he saw lots and lots of shiny
tin toys.

That made HIM want some more.

So he let out a whoop and a hoop
and a yell,
And ire jumped three times in the
ar.
Then he ranted and fumed and
cursed and swore ’
he people—they got awful

'Tlll t
scared.

He shouted and screamed while they
gathered around,

Then he spit and he pulled his hair.

An he said vile things in a big, loud
voice

’Till the people—THEY jtunped in
the air.

Then THEY ranted and fumed and
whoopcd and yelled,

gAnd got clubs and guns by the score.

THEY knocked out a hole in the
high stone wall,

And let out a mighty roar.

Oh, the guns went boom and the
guns \\ ent bang,

But the little man just sat down to
stare.

Then he let out a giggle—than a
high screechy laugh,

And ran back home to his lair.

He played in the mire all day and
all night, ,

Until there was no more noise.

Until he was sure all the people
were gone.

And all that was left, his shiny tin
toys.

A word of caution just at the end,

For stories I've heard told,

That some of these men still live
back in the hills

Just like in days of old.

And they still laugh and jump and
shine their toys,

In corners that WE can't see,

And if We don‘t catch 'em pretty
darn soon,

There won‘t, be much left of YOU
and

me.

To the Editor'

From the various nchpupet‘s I
have gathered that a great rejuven-
ating campaign is underway to raise
the standards of the touching pro-
fession and at the some time make.
way for better teachers in boiler
schools. It seems that this will be
done by encouraging exceptional
students to enter the profession and
by enlarging the teacher-training
program.

The principle involved is corri—
.mcndable but hasn't it occurred to
the “cdiicntionui dio—lrards" that all
their programs: and advertising can
lilt.il?lt.‘l‘ do the job that a dollar can
(0

It, all boils down to the fact that
lucrativu positions will always on—
tice qualified personnel to leave low-
paying ])(lf~‘l1.i(ills. Oh, it's trite timt
a few would stay in the profession
because they preferred it (more
likely. teaching is all they know)
but when a teacher finds his margin
between livmar expenses and income
is too narrow, he starts looking
around . . . and it's l-lio host who
are asked.

I think that much more could be
accomplished if the legislators
agreed on giving financial aid that
its financial aid. so that when the
Education Department tacks on

their additional requirements the
teacher will still have an increase.

0mg, 

This Reporter is given the widest latitude as author
of this column, although his viewpoints do not neces-
sarily reflect those of the Sum COLLEGE News.

 

 

Watch your step! Our ivory tower is padded so Well,
that the collegiate aura seems to cloud what we really
should be worrying about: The World—remember?
And this specimen, our world, is in a peculiar state
of paradox.

LINE-UP

Just take a quick look at the presidential line-up.
Why, the American way of life must have a way of
giving rare assurance—even MacArthur, this Week,
has shown that he actually feels himself capable. Al-
though not actually seeking the vote, it would be posi-
tively “recreant” to balk the call of the lAmerican
people . . . Hmm, sounds familiar . .

A SLICK GAME

One of the “hottest” issues of recent times, was
the current deportation crusade against trade-union
leaders who happened to be members of the Com-
munist party. Wake up! You who fear this “infiltra-
tion” . . . how sad your line of reasoning is. IF you
want to further the cause of Democratic thinking,
remember that in our set-up, you must accept not only
OUR. political ideas, but the conflicting ones—unless
of course. they result in violence. You’ve played into
their hands, when you stop thinking and talking and
READING. So, before you heave those cherished
democratic principles out of the window. stop and
ask yourself: “Am I being any different than these
“totalitarians” that I’m trying to purge?”
UN-AMERICAN IS RIGHT!

The House Uri-American Activities Commmittee
seems to have its eye on civilian control—poor Dr.
Edward Condon, noted Atomic scientist, it has been
announced. is not "loyal." I‘chl ’l‘chl They seem to
forget.that these smear-campaigns accomplish noth-
ing, but impeding progress. Is it that they are so
worried about the "loyalty" angle, or is it just an ob-
vious attempt to transfer the atomic commission to
military's outstretched arms?

MILITAEILY SPEAKING

As the hearing of UM'I‘ begins in the Senate. I
shudder w ren I hear that the cost is being put at
$1,541,900.000. It's a frightening sum—and if you
want something to be afraid of, this is your “meat.”
And, oh. what just a morsel of said “meat” would look
like in a starving educational diet. And they scoff at
“trucks. not tanks.” Evey man to his own opinion.
but at least admit that the sum spent for education
is minute in comparison. They say that you get what
you pay for.

MARSHALL-INC THOUGHT

When gathering your momentum for backing ERP.
there's always the question wlicther its aim is—“what's
good for Europe'K-ror “what's bad for Russia." The
classic “comeback” is-—“Well, what do YOU suggest?"
Is it really being idealistic to think that it might
be UN's job—no political strings attached? You know,
sometimes an organization needs an all-compassing
activity of coordination to make it work. I said-
sometimes.

WHERE Oil WHERE?

It doesn‘t seem as though there‘s one neWspoper
left that fulﬁlls its duties adequately. The Times has
an amazing way of giving coverage—ditto for the PM.
What one has to do nowadays. is to read one stan-
dard newspaper per day and supplement it with as
many others within onc's rcuch. It's almost incredible
- —wlurt on crtrth has happened to our inciting-pot of‘
diverse talents? But maybe there’s a stronger "want"
for partisan papers. Might be.

NO’l‘ l‘ltliAClllNG

This week's column has not been an attempt to set
the. weak on sturdy i‘cctmyou‘rc old enough to do your
own appraising—ii" you fool the world situation is finc.
for be it, from this writer to discourage you‘vif you'd

uizzes "Man In Commons

Well, the “Man On The
Street” Was in the Commons
last Wednesday, but neverthe-
less he was able to express his
opinion as WROW made a tape
recording of interviews with
several habitues of this State
rendezvous.

Any and all available at 10
a. m. were seized by the an-
nouncer and questioned as to
major subjects, extra-curricular
activities. favorite dance-bands
and the usual interrogations.
Generally the replies were quite
conventional but one might
have wondered over Bob Frey-
er’s reply to the question of the
week, "Where would you want
to go if all your expenses were
paid?” The man said Icelandi

To those who heard the play-
back at 1:30 p. m. the same day,
one explanation for the general
accoustical atmosphere (which
resembled that of Grand Cell-
trai) might be suggested by an-
other question—who fell under
the ping-pong table?

Bill To Create
State University
Raises Protest

(Continued from Page 1, Column 4)

ers, in a joint statement, rejected
the regents’ protest. The leaders
noted the regents wanted the power
of the trustees limited to “planning
and recommendations" at least un<
til next year and added, “We feel
strongly that the Young commission
did not intend the state university
board of trustees to be another
planning body. After two years of
debate the time has come for ac-
tion.” ,
Catholics Oppose Measure

Charles J. Tobin, legislative rep-
resentative for the Catholic Wel-
fare Le-ugue, declared opposition to
the bipartisan measure in its pre-
sent form as it came up for passage
in the Senate Wednesday. A spokes-
man for the league also stated that
private educators feel the state uni-
versity bill gives “practically no pro-
tection to private colleges."

Mr. Tobin stated that the state's
22 Catholic institutions were con-
cerned with the matter solely as
members of the Association of Col-
ieges and Universities, headed by
the Reverend Robert I. Gannon,
president of Fordham University.
Private educators. Mr. Tobin added,
feel bills establishing a $200 million
decentralized state university sys—
tem “go beyond" recommendations
of the Young Commission on the
need of a state university. Repub-
lican and democratic sponsors con—
tend the legislation is a "faithful
implementation” of the Young
Commission report.

He also said the objections were
not concerned with the bill outlaw-
ing racial and religious discrimin-
ation in admittance of students to
colleges and universities in the
state, the measure exempts religi-
ous or denominational educational
institutions from its religious pro-
visions, though the racial provi-
sions still apply.

Lawyer Fears Politics

Frank Picrrcpont Graves, Albany
lawyer who formerly served as
State Cormnlsslonor of Education,
expressed fear that the proposed
new plan might some day provide
it foothold for politicis in the state

 

Student-Faculty ’
M emorial Report

A report of the Student Faculty
War Memorial Committee discus-
sion of the present system of selec-
tion of cheerleaders, and announce-
ment of a meeting of organization
heads constituted the main busi-
ness at Wednesday’s Student Coun-
cil Meeting.

The Student Faculty War Me-
morial Committee reported the sug-
gestion that the Lounge be redec-
orated as a Memorial project, and
named the War Memorial Lounge.

Student Council discussed the
present system of election of cheer-
leaders by Student Association, and
agreed to approve if action should
be to eliminate this section from
the Student Association Constitu-
tion. Members of WAA would be
willing to assume responsibility for
training and selection of cheer-
leaders in such a case.

A meeting of heads of organiza-
tions- on April 14, at 7:30, was an-
nounced. At this meeting, organi-
zation heads will explain plans for
next year, and discuss criticisms
and suggestions from the members
of Student Association present.

It was suggested at the meeting
that the Student Faculty Committee
should continue working throughout
the year, instead of functioning
only as a planning organization.

ested in lending one of the groups—
sports, drainatics, handicraft or
home urts——between the hours of

dlcuted that while he had complete
faith in the integrity of and state
university board set up by Gov-
crnor Dcwoy he felt the present
proposal giving wide administration
powers to a board named by .the
Governor might lead to future a-
busc. ,
“Newborn universities are partic-
ularly susceptible to political uran-
cuvcring," he said. noting that in
some states where control has been
vested in a governor educational
scandals have resulted.

your community colleges: two medi-
cal centers and absorption into the
