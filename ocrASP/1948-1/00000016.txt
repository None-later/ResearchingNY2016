The. Iowa Child welfare Research
Station, University of Iowa, is offer-
ing several graduate half-time
teaching appointments. These posi-
tions :‘last‘ for '. eleven months and
tuition, «medical and student fees
are-freer :~  s. _
Although initial appointments are
for: a term of one year, these assist-
antships usually extend over a- per-
iod of tw0 years during which the
holders carry up to ten hours grad-
uate'work each semester.Since the
pre-school groups have only half-
day sessions. each student fully par-
ticipates as a teacher of that group
in which she is working. In the
coii'rsei of her appointment, she
teaches in all four age groups—two
through five years—and works in
an. educational program for hos-
pitalized children.

Child Welfare is a graduate de-
partment in the University of Iowa
and presents training programs lead-
ing to the MA. and Ph.D. degrees.
In the ﬁeld of early childhood edu-
cation there are two basic curricula
from which a“ student may choose
her‘ training: 1) A terminal masters
program’ designed to prepare the
student for a. professional career as
a teacher and supervisor in pre-
schooleducation. This program does
not require a thesis. 2) A doctoral
program in which training and ex-
perience are provided in the areas
most commonly'needed professional-
ly. It includes both theoretical and
practical approaches to the study
of child development and behavior,
the theory and content of the cur-
riculum in early childhood educa-
tion, family relations, nutrition,
physical growth, and school super-
vision and administration. Special
laboratory courses for teachers re-
lated to the use of plastic materials,
to the content of general science ap-

_.__By JACK norm
The Varsity Cagers ﬁnished up

Bow To A. B. C.,-
their season’s hardwood activity in   
a blaze of glory, copping their last

three games. Rebounding from a gicn.’  Deadlocked

seven game losing streak, the cag-
ers knocked off Fitchburg Teachers, of Second Position
State’s Intercollegiate Bowling

and didn’t stop until North Adams
and Utica had been taken into camp.
Over at North Adams last Fri- League representatives dropped their
match to A.B.C. Wednesday even-
ing 2-1. Siena's 2-1 loss at the hands

day the statesmen won their tilt

statesmen to retain their hold on

first place. The Engineers' victory

 

 

 

and they didn't really get under way
until late in the ﬁrst quarter. But
our Bay State rivals never were in
the game and closed in on the
Varsity’s long lead only after the
second string had played most of
the second half. The Worth Adams
College with an enrollment of less
than two hundred students were
represented by an aggressive cage
team and should be permanent
members of our cage slate. The
inter-state rivalry might well grow
into an interesting highlight of the
State Cage schedule.

They Came, We Conquered

Saturday night the Varsity Cagers
brought their season to a ﬁtting
close by turning in the best per-
formance of the year. The States-
men led all the way in downing the
classy Utica College live 75-71. Em-
ploying the three-man weave intro-
duced by Coach Hathaway just be-
fore the first Utlca tilt, the Var-
sity played sparkling ball in win-
ning their ﬁnal game. The Cagers
had to play great ball to down the
fast-stepping Uticnns who could nev-
er be considered out of the running
until the closing seconds.

Each and every Cager turned in
his best games of the season. Sy
Fcrsh was particularly brilliant in
the key pivot slot and chipped in
with twenty-six markers. But you
could go right down the line and
single out the scintillating floorplay

with the Loudonvlllers. Albany Law
downed Pharmacy 2-1 in the other
match.

Leading-off bowling activities for
the match. A.B.C. nipped the Var-
sity 787-781. The Businessmen
rolled to their six-pin advantage de-
spite Fran Muliin’s high single of
the opener.

Cop Middle Game

Rebounding from their first game
setback, the statesmen scored a win
in the second game. State’s winning
margin was 863-840. Joe Carosella
paced the Varsity bowlers, while
Dundham of A.B.C. came through
with the high single of 202. Moving
into the “rubber” game, the States-
men were dropped by the Business-
men to the tune of a 851-791 count.

Utica Five 52-51

Lyle Walsh, rolling his first match.   

Last Friday and Saturday nights
saw the end of the Junior Varsity
seasons. On Friday night the Jun-
ior Varsity Journeyed to Pharmacy
to play the Pharmacy J. V.
Leading all of the way the "Drug-
gists" took the game by the score
of 36-27. Branche of Pharmacy
held the scoring honors for the
evening with 14 points. Bill Dunn
led the State J. V. with 6.

Saturday night Utica visited State
and engaged in a hard fought game.
The contest saw the lead change
hands several times throughout the
evening. State held the edge at
half-time, leading 24-22. In the
close. hard fought second half Utica
showered baskets from the field.
but the State J. V. came out of the
game victorious. The final score
was 52-51. Paul Carter" and Jim
Warden took the scoring honors for
Stiito with 18 and 10 points respec-
tively Winter of Utica was high
mun with 19 points.

.liiyvecs Show Improvement

The game also saw a battle be-
tween two hometown boys. Paul
Carter and "Windy" Winter, both of
North Tonawanda. The boys have
played together on hometown teams
before leaving to go to college. Paul
and “Windy” formed the second
base combination for the North
Toniiwmidn Dodgers, ll semi-pro
busebnll team, during the summer.

Despite the loss of Carter, War-
den. and Weathcrby to the Varsity
in the middle of season for road
trips the J. V. showod steady ini-
provcmeiu. throughout the season.
The three boys could play for the
Junior Varsity at home. but for the
gumci. on the road they accom~
piuiied the Varsity.

'Divide Cage Rivalry

The Sophs and the Fresh
tangled it up for two more
games (fellows and girls, both,
that is) before they could de-
cide who to award the six points
to. So what did the boys and
girls of blue and green do? They
split 'em.

After the Sophomores had
taken two on opening nir ill. the
Frosh came back Thursday,
February 26th. to sweep the bill.
The rejuvenated Freshmen girls
took the measure of their older
opponents, 34-21. Green guys
followed up with a rousing 50-
35 victory.

The following Thursday, the
4th of March, saw the girls take
the floor for a hair-raising
“fight-off" in which the grem-
lins squeezed through 31-29. Fol-
lowing them onto the floor, but
not into the win column. the
Fresh fellows dropped their
play-off: 45-33. After a tight
first. half, in which they trailed
16-15, the Sophs came back to
salt the game away in the third
quarter. The third period score
was a 13-point edge for the
Blue-jays. Fighting hard '51
closed it up to four points at
one time but were never able to
best the Soplis, paced by Ros-
setti‘s 10 and MoGi'nth's l4

utscores Mm. State:

State’s basketball team closed its
season successfully, downing Mas-
sachusetts State and Utica in final
games. The score of the State-
Massachusetts state game was 50-

'45, while the Varsity outscored

Utica 75-71.

Massachusetts State fell before the
Purple and Gold for the second time
this season last Friday at North
Adams. The Varsity led all the
way, although they had to stave
off a_ last-quarter rally by their
opponents.

Take Lead Early

State took the lead early and led
12-9 at the end of the first ten
minutes. The Varsity increased its
lead to 12 points in the second
stanza and walked off the court at
half time with a 28-16 lead. e
winners went way out in front at
the end of the third period, 38-22.
North Adams rallied in the last
quarter and pulled up to within
four points of State with a minute
left to play. State employed suc-
cessful "freezing" tactics during the
last five minutes, although they
were pressed hard by the losers.

Kenny George and Walt Schick
paced the State's scoring with twelve
points apiece. Jim Coles hit double
figures with ten. Whalen paced Mas-
sachusetts State's last ditch stand
and was high scorer of the game
with thirteen points. State won the
game at the free throw line, sink-
ing twelve free throws to the laser's
seven. Each team scored nineteen
baskets from the field.

Utica Defeated

Saturday’s game ,with Utica at
Page Hall was a hard fought con.-
test. The officials called the gamé
very closely and kept the game unj-
der control. State began hittin
early and grabbed a ten point lea
in four minutes of playing time.
Utica rallied, but State led 19-12 at
the end of the first stanza. S'
Fcrsh paced State's first quarter
drive, dunking in eleven points. ‘

The Varsity, paced by Jim Coles
and Tom O'Brien sported to a 27
14 lead as the i'lrst half ended;
Utica, led by Klefer and Martiniak,
rallied again and State took a 37.-
31 lead as the first half ended' ‘

Utica pulled up to within two
points of the home team: 50—48, iii
the third quarter. State hold their
slim lead, and the score at the end
of the third period was 50-53;. Ken-
ny George paced the Statesmen'ls
scoring in this period. ,.
Losers Rally Again

Utica made its last bid early in
the fourth quarter. Paced by Dynak,
the visitors again pulled to within
two points with seven minutes to
play. The rally failed and State
