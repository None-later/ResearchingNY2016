Discussion Clubs

The American Friends Service
Committee, working in the United
States, Mexico and Europe, offers
plans for volunteer work, and study
projects each summer. These serv-
ice opportunities are sponsored by
the Quakers in the belief that peace
is more than the absence of war;
through co-operative study and
work they attempt to solve some of
the problems existing today.

Such plans as peace caravans,
institutes of international relations,
wcrk camps, internatiolal service
seminars, interneship and institu-
tional service units form their pro-
gram.

Hearquarters of the American
Friends Service Committee are at
20 South 12th Street, Philadelphia

RAY MCKINLEY‘S styling of the

" is

New Orleans ditty, “Airizay,” is attracting

lots of fans. If you ask Ray about it, he says:

“I’ve found from long‘experience what style of

music we do best—just as I’ve learned from

experience that Camels suit my ‘T-Zone’ to a ‘T.’ ”
Try Camels! Learn for yourself why, with

smokers who have tried and compared,

Camels are the “choice of experience.”

And here’s another great record-

It seems.- that one of our star

field. We were more than pleasantly
surprised at the operetta last week-
end when We noticed one of the
sailors in the “chorus” line doing
his dance with a distinctive bas-

proper to'award to Mr. Kenneth

At one of the recent WAA meet-
ings, the Council voted to take
over the election of college cheer—
leaders. This, however, has yet to
be passed by Student Association
before it can legally be added to the
WAA constitution. The matter is
to be brought up in assembly today.
VOtilig' on this amendment will take
place on the first Friday after va-
cation.

To continue in the same vein may
we make a slight suggestion for
next year. The rules and set-up for
the tournament should be posted
before the tourney begins and forums
should at least know how many
games they may have to play.

That's all for this year, folkSlCS. . .
