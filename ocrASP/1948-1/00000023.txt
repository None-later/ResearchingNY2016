Milne Spring ConceriL ‘Promises

By COLETTA FITZMORRIS

You’ve all heard about Milne’s
Spring Concert—if not why did you
cut assembly last week? However,
that is beside the point; the point
being that from the sampling we
had last Friday it promises to be
a production worth attending.

Just in case you’re not convinced,
here is a hillt of what you’ll hear
if you take the tip. The program
is divided into four parts . . . each
original and very different, accord-
ing to Dr. Roy York, Milne’s di-
rector.

The following scene is Dr. York’s
pride and joy. Acording to him, it

Religious Clubs

Plan Meetings

.Plans announced this week by
religious clubs include: a confer-
ence at Hobart College, a meeting
and ll Communion breakfast sched-
uled by Newman Club; a speaker
sponsored at a Tri City meeting by
IVCF; :1 Capitol District Student
Christian Movement Banquet slat-
ed for Saturday by SCA. In addi-
tion, SCA has announced plans for
nomination of officers, and New—
lllilll has released nominations al-
ready made for next year‘s officers.

The Central Province of Newman
Club Confederation will hold a con-
fcroncc at Hobart College this
week end. extending from today un-
til Sunday. The following people
from State will attend: Eleanor
Holbig ‘48, Shirley Caslcr '50, Paul
King and John Lchr, freshmen.

The Saturday program will ill-
ciudc student panel discussions, a
biiilqllL‘L at Club 86, tulks by college

is the first time that this has even
been staged in Albany. He has en-
titled his pmdigy, “Vale of Shang-
ri-La", and just as the title suggests,
the theme will be oriental. The de—
tails are not for publication, but
here is a teaser. When the curtains
are opened the Milnettcs and a col-
oratura soprano will be on stage
providing the back-ground music,
while a ballet group dances to “Song
of India." There's more to the scene,
but that’s to be seen.

The finale will be staged against
a modernistic back-drop. At this
time the Milnettcs will sing a
group of three songs, followed by
three others by the Male Ensemble.
All of this will be topped by the
two groups singing together. The
conclusion will feature “Oh What a
Beautiful Morning", “Country Style"
(in tnxcs, incidentally) and the
well received “Battle Hymn of the
Republic."

The entire production is being
dedicated to Dr. Robert Fredericks,
who founded the Milne music de-
partman in 1941.

Class Of ’51 Aims Sky-High,-
Slale’s Affairs Looking Up

Yep, things are certainly
looking up around State these
days. Part of the reason is that
spring is in the air, of course,
but the other part might be at-
tributed to the fact that Spring
Rhapsody is in the making.

The NEWS realizes that it’s
not making any profound state-
lnent by printing the above fact,
because the results of the frosh’s
work is already obvious . . . cs-
pccially in lower Huested and
Hawley. Here the Class of ’51 is
carrying out their spring theme
as far as possible.

Atmosphere is being blended
into the fresh tan paint by the
use of traditional festive ob-
jects . . . butterflies and bees
and flowers among other things.
Music fills the air as quietly as
possible and descriptive words
are posted there to add to the
daze. A column decked with
life-like roses completes this
picture of a spring wonderland.

All of this is to be followed by
more, according to Jean Sand-
burg. publicity director, so quit
cutting classes. kids; the fresh—
men huvc cooked up a home-
made spring lever for you.
