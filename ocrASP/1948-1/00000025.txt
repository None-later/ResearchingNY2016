IM Volleyball Leagues
Near Hallway Mark

The Ham 8.! Eggers gained a foot-
ing on the intramural volleyball
league title nipping the Faculty
15-7; 15-13. Because of a cancelled
game Potter Club remained inac-
tive thus dropping to second place,
a half game behind the Ham &
Eggers. .

After a slow start, KDR shows
great potentialities by their vic-
tories in the last two tilts. Their
last victory was gained over KB by
the scores of 15-1 and 15-8. Stan
Abrams sparked a fourmiin KB
team in it lost cause.

In the junior circuit, a tight race
looms between the Celtics, Ment-
hcuds, and Farmers Amalgamated.
Each team boasts two victories so
far in the early season.

On Monday night the Ham 8.:
Eggi-i‘s uiid Fottcr meet in a battle

inter-Collegiate
Sports ' Program

When Mr. Truman tosses out the
first ball to officially open the
baseball season on Monday, he’ll be
using his “south paw." But it won’t
mean a thing compared to the two-
fisted plan which the ICA Confer-
enc': adopted here last week end.

The Conference, through its
Inter-Collegiate Sports Division,
has started the ball rolling toward
an athletic program between the
Teacher Colleges which may prove
to give a necessary transfusion to
the status of Teacher College ath-
letics. The plan, long the hope of
Inter-Collegiate fans, will give def-

inite impetus to Varsity sports andv

to activity in the women’s division.

:ihzly, tile 1_ll'\)2;,'1‘2llll would in-
cluiu- tile formation of a basketball
league between the State Teacher
Colleges with a circulating trophy
to be awarded to each season's
winner. For women, play days be-
tween the WAA groups of the col—
leges would be arranged.

To get the program under way,
the Conference elected our own
Jerry Dunn ‘51, as Coordinator of
the Sports Program. He will send
letters to the Athletic Associations
of the various colleges, to the Col-
lege Presidents, to the Student As-
sociations, and to the faculty direc-
tors of athletics. These letters, to
be sent this coming week. will ex-
plain the program in the hope of
guaging opinions on the formation
of such a union. If favorable rc-
plies are received, ICA, at its next
meeting to be held at Brockport
early in the full. will make definite
plans for the program.

Such a program as this, proposed
by the conference delegates can be
put into operation only through the
full cooperation of the student
bodies of the colleges concerned.
From here it looks like a good deal.

Faces Pharmacy
In First Game

With it’s opening game scheduled
for one week from today, state’s
baseball team is hard. at work iron-
ing out last minute wrinkles. The
first opponent of the State nine
will be Pharmacy, who is renewing
last year’s rivalry with the home
team.

Bad weather has held up the
team's practice early this week.
Monday the pitchers and catchers
reported to the gym while the rest
of the foam was idle. On Tuesday
there “as no practice at all. Coach
Hathaway is carrying all twenty-
nine tryouts but plans a out either
today or early next week. Eventu-
ally the team will be pared down
to fifteen or sixteen men.

Right now main emphasis is on
getting in shape, especially the all-
iinportant arm. In addition: field-
ing, pitching and hitting are also
being stressed. Of the first-year
men, Carter, Englehardt, McDon-
ald, Stevenson and Warden look
good in the hitting department.

This year’s schedule consists of
ten games. rather than last year's
four. Of the six teams on the
schedule, State played only three
last year: Siena, ABC, and Phar-

macy. Seven games will be played
at home at Bleccker Stadium.
