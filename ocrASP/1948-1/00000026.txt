Supreme Court

Religious Rule

Causes Controversy In Systems

Compiled from March 9-10, edi-
(ions of the “New York Times”
and an article in the April issue of
the "American School Board Jour-
nal”, by Herbert B. Mulford.

By RUTH COOKINGHAM

Religious instruction in public
school buildings was declared un-
constitutional by the United States
Supreme Court March 8, but ac-
tion taken as a result of this deci-
sion has been such as to question
the effectiveness of the decision.
Several administrative officials for
the city and the state of New York
have voiced their opinions on the
incificacy of the declaration in
changing the New York system.

Dr. William Jansen, Superintend-
ont of Schools of New York City,
announced no change in the city’s
program of permitting children to
leave the school building to receive
religious instruction during school

time. He “guesses” that the ruling

would not affect the New York '

school system “very much.” Nicho-
las Bucci, law secretary of the
Board of Education, said that an-
other Suprcme Court decision would
be necessary to affect New York’s
city system. Charles A. Brind,
counsel for New York State Educa-

tion Department, announced that l

the current practice of allowing
children to take religious instruc-
tion outside regular school classes
would be continued unless the law
permitting it was held unconstitu-
tional.

At the monian there are, accord-
ing to Mr. Mulford, scvcral contro-
versial situations which continue to
confuse the problem. First, emin-
ent counsel holds that the decision
has not merely stopped released-
time training within school build-
ings; rather the long-time practices,
heretofore lawful, of renting space
in school buildings for any reli-
gious purpose must stop. Argu-
ments of justices conflict with brac-
ticcs so much that if they were
pressed into practice it would take
ten years to clear the decision.
Communications are going to all
the 3,000 cotninunity councils on
religious education in the United
States urging them to strictly ob-
serve the law but not give up hope
that the problem will be solved. A
new group of approximately 30
leaders has formed to try to imple-
niont the recommendations of the
American Council on Education to
create an “awareness” regarding
religion in the public school curricu-
lum. And lastly, grcntcr publicity

To Feature Satire
Directed By Ely

Birds, Bees, Flowers

Will Herald Arrival
OF Timely Production

“Spring Rhapsody," the freshman
Big-4 production, which will be held
tomorrow night in the Page Hall
auditorium at 8:30 p. m., is an or-
iginal musical comedy in two acts
written by Donald 'P. Ely, Georgina
Maginess, Alice Gersh and Charlotte
Skolnick. The play is under the
direction of Donald P. Ely.

All events are played up in a
satirical manner with the setting in
a park of a European city.

Relate Spring Plot

The plot concerns two young girls
who take a walk in the park to
soothe their “spring fcvcr." One of
the girls, played by Greta Glad-
stone, is intrigued by a peanut ven-
dor, played by Benjamin Santot‘a,
but his affections toward her are
quite restrained.

The other girl, Claryce Jeanne
Pci'i'cttn, is overwhelmed by the
swift passes 01‘ a traveling sales-
man, Frederic Knocrzer, but due
to unfortunate circumstances, her
opinion of him soon changes. Soon
afterwards, she meets a young phil-
osophy studan, played by David
Wcthcrby, and thus unfolds the
plot.

Feature Theme and Orchestra
Among the special features of the
show is an orchestra under the di-
motion of Richard Thorne who also
plays the piano. Other members of
the orchestra include Joan Whit-
criii‘t, Michael LaMunna, Donald
Burt, Edward Johnson and Donald
McDonald. Music composed es-
pecially for the show by Richard
'l‘hoi'no, is “Love at First Sight" and
