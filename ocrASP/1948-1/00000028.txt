Of Newman Club

30 Colleges Convene
o Revise Constitution,

Slate New Officers

The Newman Club Federation
Convention of the Central New
York Province was held at Hobart
and William Smith Colleges in Gen-
eva, New York, last week end. Ap-
proximately thirty colleges, includ-
ing 250 delegates, were represented.
Delegates from State were Eleanor
Holbig ‘48, Shirley Casler ’50, and
John Lehr and Paul King, fresh-
men.

State Purpose of Meeting

The Central New York Province
includes all the colleges of the cen-
tral part of the state, and Buffalo
and Albany State Teachers’ Col-
leges as well. The purpose of the
convention was to revise the Con-
stitution of the Province, set up a
new slate of officers, decide the lo-
cation of next year’s convention,
and to enable the Newman Clubs of
the Province to meet each other
and exchange suggestions for the
improvement of the clubs.
Reddington Addresses Group

The program included registra-
tion and an informal reception at
Hobart College. On Saturday, a
panel discussion occupied the morn-
ing, followed by a banquet at the
Club 86. Principal speaker at the
banquet was Reverend John Red-
dington, s.T.B., of Geneva. An-
other panel discussion was held in
the afternoon, and the delegates
attended an informal dance in the
evening.

Results of the convention include
the drawing up of a new constitu-
tion for the Central Province of
New York. A Province neWspaper
with headquarters at Sampson Col-
lege will be printed and sent to all
colleges in the Province. The con-
vention in 1948--’49 will be held at
Syracuse University in April.

Officers from Syracuse and Cort-
land were nominated and elected.

“Camels suit my ‘T-Zone’ to a ‘T.’"
Millions of smokers agree with

Find out {or yourself why, with

Camels are the “choice of experience.”

MICKEY SEAMAN

 

We hear so much about the “new
look" in fashion these days, that it
is time we took a “new look” at the
World of sports. This new look will
take us beyond the athletic pro-
gram of State College and will
branch out into the fertile field of
other college activities and national
sports on the outside.

ICA, at its recent conference, has
taken a good look into the possi-
bilities of starting an inter-collegi-
ate program. It is definitely a step
in the right direction.

’Tis rumored that State may act
as host to a woman’s basketball
play-day next winter. This could
give WAA a tremendous boost in
prestige and interest. Let's not let
the idea die on third!

The Problem

The proposed Varsity League be-
tween the Teacher Colleges presents
multi problems, but none of these
are too big to overcome IF we are
determined to do so. The money
question rears its ugly head as the
distance between the colleges is
much greater than that usually
travelled by the Varsity. Coach
Hathaway suggests an East-West
division with play-offs between the
winners. Well . . . why not?

It is a known fact that all Teach—
er Colleges are not of equal ath-
letic strength. We suggest that if
a functioning league of this type
gets under way, the Teachers Col-
leges will attract students who wish
to participate in sports. And if
basketball seems like too big an
undertaking, let's start a League in
minor sports where the ability dif-
ferences are not so great. The point
is, LET'S GET STARTED SOME-
WHERE.

We hear a great deal about Pub-
lic Relations lately. Can you
think of a better way to get the
public interested in State College
than to become members of a
Teacher College League? The hit
and miss scheduling which it has
been impossible to avoid under the
present system does not spread our
fame. The ICA League could.

Speaking of scheduling, this plan
would certainly save Coach and his
assistants a powerful number of
headaches.

The Other Half

Turning to the national scene,
the major leagues got under way
this week. Of course it is too early
to make any predictions, but we‘ll
put our money on “Dem Bums."

The Albany Senators, whom rc-
portcrs seem to think will put up a
good team this year, will open their
season Tuesday against Hartford
at Hartford. The Club will go into
the Eastern League pennan; race
with the oldest club in the Richard—
son loop. Thc combined player av-
erage is 26 years.

Millie High will play eight home
games this season. This should
give us a chance to see some of our
perspective students- in action.

The Big News

Since the biggest news of the day
is the debut of our own 1948 Busc—
baii Varsity. we can't help but urge
iill you who would like to scc lhc
team in action to join us at Blcckcr
Stadium at four o‘clock. Today's
the day. Admission by student tax.

The long awaited results of tho
WAA Ping Pong Tournaman givc
the championship to Addie Fischer
'48. She downed Elsa Mobcrp, "iii,
in the finals to cop this ycur‘s
woman‘s titlc.

As a closing thought, though it
is with us all of the time, \\'i‘ iukc
this opportunity to compliment
Paula, our venerable editor, on the
swell job shc has done on Sports
Page this year. It's been real, Tichy.

Paulo Tichy Plays Heroine
Ai Comp Johnston Weekend

Thirteen outdoor minded gals
started out for WAA‘s Camp
Johnson Friday. They sure did
not know what fate awaited!

“Scoop” Gilbert got the week-
end off to a rather warm start.
She put three logs in the pot-
belly stove in the bunk room so
that they would burn one at a
time all night to keep a con—
stant comfortable temperature.
But that courageous ‘4801‘,
Paula Tichy, came to the rescue.
When the others left to cool
off, Paula remained and vali-
antly regulated the drafts.
Someone suggested she throw
cold water on the stove to cool
it off but she knew better.

Saturday morning those full
of vim and vigor took a hike.
Poor Audrey Weller '51 10st lTCl‘
shoe in the mud. Our heroine
Paula saved the day. After div-
ing into the mud, head first,
she cxtricatcd tiic shoc.

Ray! for Paula!!!
