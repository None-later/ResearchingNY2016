” You Can’t Take It With You"

Does your sorority or frater-
nity house need pinochle cards?
Are you having trouble finding
ping pong balls in the dorm?
Then, please sponsor a silver tea
to furnish the money to pur-
chase them, but don’t borrow
(and we use the term loosely)
them from the Commons.

Campus Commission has pur-
chased new bridge and pinochle
cards' for use in the Commons
and they would like to see them
remain there. The cards will be
located in theldraWers of the new
tables. When you remove a pack,
leave the name and address of
your closest relative, your so-
cail security number, a pint of
blood and the name of the
beneficiary of your insurance
policy. Campus Commission will
not divulge any of this inform-
ation without a petition from
fifty members of Student Asso-
ciation.

Ping pong balls have also
been purchased. One ball will be
put out every Monday and
should be left on the table when
not in use. The motion to hide
it under someone's foot was de-
feated.

WHY...I smoke Chesterﬁeld

(FROM A SERIES OF STATEMENIS BY PROMINENT TOBAKO FARMERS)

“Chesterfield is my brand. I 've been smoking them for
about 16 years. I like them because they’re mild and
really satisfy. I know the kind of tobacco that’s in
them . . . it's the best.

“Chesterfield buys the beat grades of tobacco. It's
mild. light, ripe, sweet-smoking tobacco. ’l'hcy pay the
highest prices for their tobacco. It's top quality leaf.

"Rhapsody" Presents Encore
' At "Smiles" Children’s Party

No, you’re not seeing double—
it was just a repeat performance
of the Frosh Big-4 at the Albany
Home for Children. At an invi-
tation of the "Smiles" committee,
those who hadn’t seen the show
before and those who wanted to
see it again joined the youngsters
last Tuesday evening.

Georgina Maginess took over
the direction in Don Ely's ab-
sence. Greta Gladstone, C. J.
Peretta and the rest of the cast
adlibbed their ways into the kids
hearts. The performance lacked
nothing that was enjoyed here
last Saturday night. With at
least 98% of the cast there, it
was not necessary to cut any
scenes and the production was
just as spirited in its encore as
it had been as a “first-nightcr."

 

Wish To Abolish Frosh Science

Students, totaling one hundrcd and filly in number, voiccd their
opinions through (i poll taken by tho Stale College NEWS, in rcfcr—
('llt’i‘ to what courses lhcy thought should be added to thc collch

y thought should be eliminated.

Suggcslul courses varied from poiicl'y making to “how to get a man."

by u landslide majority.
