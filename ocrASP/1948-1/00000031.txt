Anthony “Twink” Prochillo,
dressed in full attire, presided
over the mock Student Council
meeting held Wednesday night
at Herbert's.

The first order of business
was the presentation of a mo-.
tion to send to “$000 "'Qilbert
a "get worse" card.‘ into. this
would require an appropriation
from the budget. the motion
would have to be tabled for a
week, according to Robert’s
Rules. A motion was then made
to suspend Robert's Rules and
use Cummings’s rules. After one
hour of discussion, someone re-
membered that there was no
surplus. Mr. Prochillo was call-
ed out of order. Caught off
guard, he leaped under the table
to adjust his custom built
sweater.

A motion was made to insert
coin machines in the women’s
locker room in order to raise the
money. This was defeated in de-
ferencc to a motion to leave it
up to “John”.

Robert's Rules of Order, which have
served as the basis of the Student

adoption, suspension of a By-law is
unconstitutional unless provided for
