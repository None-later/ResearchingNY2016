elected from St. Francis College,
New York City. and the Secretary
from Champlain College. after which
the delegates adjourned to commit-
tee hearings on bills and to hear ex—
pert testimony on housing. juvenile
delinquency and education.

Fundamental goal of the model
session was to develop techniques
by which a number of individuals
can discuss a common problem and
arrive at a solution reflecting the
best of which that group is capable.
This was carried out when the con-
vention convened Saturday morning
and the three bills were passed
without too much discussion.
Propose Non-Discrimination

The bill on housing included pro—
visions for housing for migratory
workers. subsldation of private con-
struction of multiple dwellings for
low income groups. no discrimina-
tion in providing- housing. exten-
sion of rent controls. and state en-
couragcmcnt of conversion of build-
lngs for further housing.

Juvenile delinquency recommen-
dations included community plan-
ning of community centers 01' recre-
atioh under state subsidatlon.
graduate schools in 3 universities
for training youth counsellors. year-
ly physical cxmnlnatlons of all

school children to discover tenden-
cies that. would lead to unacceptable
social behavior. restoration of de-
llnqucnts to homes and approval of
home conditions of delinquents by
investigators. If parents are found
delinquent and not able to provide
homes for the children. parents
could be charged Willi a felony.
