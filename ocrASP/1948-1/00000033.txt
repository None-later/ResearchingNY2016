 ._Lool<ing Back . . .

Another Moving~~Uo “try brifi‘gs the close of
another year. The Seniors look back with a most

nostalgic sense of happiness never to be regained,
while the Juniors look forward to a Semor year,
their climactic year, with hopeful eagerness.

Whether or not this has been a good year, no
one person can say. Each new set of officers enters
into its duties with revolutionary ideas of super
efficiency only to find that the small details of
routine hold them back. And when the routine
matters are finally mastered and new ideas ready
to be set forth, h'loving-L‘p Day approaches and
another year has ended.

But in spite of the routines, new ideas have
been set forth this year. The new insurance plan
to replace the old and very inadequate infirmary
fund is another step in State’s growth to maturity.
The voting committee advanced more ideas with
their improvements in the election system and the
heated arguments in assemblies offered substantial
proof that Student Association was wide awake.

This was a year for special assemblies, covering
everything from the legality of Who‘s Who elec-
tions to financial troubles. It was a year filled
with surprises—threats of Myskania impeachment,
realization that the Student Association surplus
ran into negative figures, even the declaring void
of a whole election.

For some of us, a glance backward will bring
a comfortable feeling of satisfaction in a job well
done, and for others of us, it means a slight twinge
of apprehension wondering if the job might not
have been done better.

Time will erase the bitterness brewed in hot
assembly disputes and wrath inducing discussions,
but time will not erase the bonds of friendships
gained here.

As the Seniors leave for higher goals, their cloak
If experience will settle over the shoulders of the
Juniors who must strive for even greater things

next year.
Thanks . . .

As the last issue of the old Board goes to press
we ask license to become personal.

We've tried to present honest, unbiased views
of news at State and hope we have accomplished
our purpose. This is our last issue. Next week,
a new Board with new thoughts and new ideas
but always the same principles of good journalism
will take over.

To the whole News staff, thanks for the hard
work and cooperation. May the next editor be
as lucky in the quality of her staff.

STATE COLLEGE NEWS. THURSDAY. MAY 6. 194B

 

l  Mam.W/tyte flag

By CHRISTIAAN LIEVESTRO
Guest Columnist

 

When asked to write this column,
I remembered that, on publication,
we would be in the holiday atmos-
phere of Moving-Up Day when the
names will be revealed of those peo-
ple who have been chosen to direct
our student activities next fall. It is
extremely unfair, unkind of me to
inject a. note of discordant unpleas-
antness while our student body is
in such a festive mood. Much bet-
ter, perhaps, to close our minds to
disturbing thoughts. But what are
the possibilities of our being to-
gether in the fall? Will we be per-
mitted to return, to continue our
normal and, we hope, constructive
activities? Will our new president,
Myskania and the other new offi-
cers even be given the opportunity
to work for our common efforts and
ideals?

I am not a patriot. Nationalism,
Americanism, is a hateful disease,
usurping not alone such large con-
cepts as democratic international-
ism and world peace, but our own
campus life. It is impossible that
we shall return in the fall to the
college life we share this Moving-
Up Day. America’s preparations
for war—both material and psycho-
logical—assure us of that.

Democracy and its ideals—liberty,
justice, truth—have been betrayed
by the despicable acts of a govern-
ment which, by its repudiation of
policy, has been instrumental in
exploding the Palestine powder keg
into a full-scale war, a government
that interfered in a most disgrace-
ful and selfish manner in the Ital-
ian elections, that refused to ratify
the Constitution of the World
Health Organization because it
fears socialization of medicine. All
this to serve the illiberal interests
of despotic groups that strive ruth-
lessly for power and profit and im-
pose their will upon our govern-
ment.

Faith and loyalty in such a gov-
ernment falter in the face of its
humiliating and shocking behavior
that abuses the very essence and
original purpose of our American
ideals and traditions. The Russian-
American conflict has diverted vi—
tal and indispensable economic aid

to Europe from its original objective
to a new pre-war lend lease.

But what choice remains to State
students? Bound by social pres-
sure, we are condemned to a pat-
tern chosen for us by the counsels
that prevail in our government and
their insane militarlstic philosophy
that murders world democracy while
pretending to.defend it.

The mass attitude is simply a
dismayed, numbed submission to
share our government’s belief that
an ideological struggle can be de-
cided by atomic weapons in default
of the ability of sane, democratic
methods to create social conditions
impregnable to Communist infilt-
ration.

I despise of“: political and eco-
nomic system of Russia and I do
not argue for appeasement. But
the whole concept of victory through
national military power is obsolete,
since it is an accepted fact that
another world war means the de-
struction of civilization as we know
it. We do not need more arms and
men. We need social and economic
action which will meet the needs of
a destitute Europe. Any armed
forces which are required should be
internationally owned. Directed by
its most selfish impulses, America
has been loathe to sacrifice its na-
tionalistic interests for the creation
of a real and working international
organization.

What possible hope is there for
the young men of this college who
are forced to become imbued with
a military attitude which no longer
permits them a sense of individual
moral and human values? The
deeper the penetration of military
influence into our educational sys-
tem, the more readin our whole do-
mestic structure becomes geared to
a military economy and We shall
become aggressive to a point where
we will prefer to solve our problems
by military rather than by political,
economic, or moral means.

But we students at State do have
a choice. We can plead for ways
other than military for bringing or-
der and justice into our lives or—
we shall be forced to make our posi-
tion clear by threatening civil dis-
obedience.

i fﬁfif‘lifwaai

This Reporter is given the widest latitude as author
of this column, although his viewpoints do not neces-
sarily reflect those of the STATE COLLEGE Naws.

 

I was informed by the editor that it is customary
for the presiding columnist of this section of our
scandal sheet to predict the outcome of the elections.
My first impression was that it was a good idea,
since it would cut down the amount of genius I would
have to pour into the column (genius comes at a
premium, you knowi. However, when I sat down at
this typewriter, I began to realize what a task I had
cut out for myself.

Predictions
Be that as it may, here I go:

For Vice-President of Student Association, I pre-
dict that Heinz Engel will win despite a strong write-
ln vote for Tony the Janitor.

.For President of Student Association, I think Cath-
rine Donnelly will edge out by a narrow margin both
Langsley and Jennings.

For Myskania, from the recommended list, I believe
all will receive the necessary yes votes; from the stig-
gested list, I predict success for Bob Baker, Don
Langsley, Joe Zanchelli, and Bob Wilcox.

For Presidents of the respectable classes ‘49—.lim
Brophy; ’50—Earle Jones; '5l—Jay Miller... And last,
but far from least, I not only predict that “Bubbles”
Dombrowski will win Cheerleader hands down. but
if he doesn't—I'll personally demand a recount!

We Cry For Vengeance

There is a grave injustice being perpetrated on
the male element of State College. I feel a firm
conviction that it is my duty to leap to the defense
of my comrades in pants, and expose the whole sor-
did affair. Let me conjure up for you a picture of a
plight so sorry that tears will surely flow from each
and every eye.

It is a busy day, and our typical State College male
is earnestly in search of knowledge, rushing upstairs
and down, from one class to the other. His schedule
calls for him to attend a class in Richardson, and
he is on his way, when suddenly he feels a call even
stronger than that of Minerva. So he quickens his
pace, hoping by this to save himself a few extra mo-
ments of enjoyment.

Now he is in Richardson. Ah, there's the room
he wants—but no, that’s a broom closet. Maybe on
the second floor. Women Faculty. Nooo-o. Music.
Noo—O! God, only one floor left. It has to be here.
I can't go on with this heart-rending narrative. Suf-
fice it to say that this unit of Joe College goes to
class—without having that long desired smoke. Why?
Is it an old, long forgotten section of the State Con-
stitution that prevents the authorities frotn installing
a men's rest room in Richardson? I can‘t rightly
say. but it is a sin that cries out to Heaven for ven-
geancel

Let's Philosophize

Tomorrow the news wil all be out about elections,
and I'll be looking ruefully at my predictions. It's a
day with enough pleasure for everyone if you go into
it with the right attitude. Any student office you
win is well worth working at. and working hard. But
none of the offices is worth shedding a tear over if
you don't win. Fame, especially the collegiate vari-
ety. is a very fleeting- thing. This is your homely
philosopher signing off for now, with good luck to
everyone, except Siena and Plattsburg.

Varsity Faces Plattsburg
 ~—— in TomorroW's Encounter

State Drops Siugfest
To Utica Nine, 27-11

Tomorrow afternoon State con-
tinues its season facing Plnttsburg
at Lincoln Park. In last week‘s
games, the Varsity dropped an 18-5
decision to Sierra and 27-11 game
to Utica.

With Utica leading 6-1 going into
the fifth inning in last Saturday's
game, State‘s defense fell apart
temporarily and Utica pushed across
13 runs. In this inning, the Utes
put together nine hits and were
aided by two walks and three errors
by State.

State Gets 7 in Ninth

The home team’s best inning was
the ninth when they plated seven
runs. Englehart walked to open the
inning and moved to second on Car-
ter's single. Dickinson was safe on
an error, after which Englehart
scored on it passed ball. Glenday
and Marzello walked to force in
State’s second run. George singled
home Dickinson, and Glenday scor-
ed when Warden was safe on a
Utica error. Farley walked to score
Marzello, and Englehart singled in
George and Warden to end State’s
scoring.

Tucker started for state and was
relieved by Clearwater in the sec-
ond. Dalton came on in the fourth
and was relieved by Blavotnick in
the ninth. Belzak was the winning
pitcher, Tucker the loser. Marzello
hit a long home run for State in
the seventh, but failed to touch
second base.

Indians Score 11 in First

State had one bad inning last
Thursday against Siena when the
Loudonviilers scored eleven runs.
Discounting the eleven-run first in-
ning it was a close 7-5 ball game.

The team got a run in the second
when with two down, Marzello.
Glenday, Farley and Monroe walk-
ed. They added four more in the
fourth when Marzello and Glenday
walked to open the inning. Farley
singled home Marzello, and Glen-
