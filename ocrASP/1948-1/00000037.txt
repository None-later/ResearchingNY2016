It is a busy day, and our typical State College male
is earnestly in search of knowledge, rushing upstairs
and down. from one 01am to the other. His schedule
calls for him to attend a class in Richardson. and
he is on his way. when suddenly he feels a call even
stronger than that of Minerva. So he quickens his
pace, hoping by this to save himself a few extra mo-
merits of enjoyment.
