. The Primer staff is faced with a financial prob-
ie and aproblem which if not considered intelli-

"geiitly by Student Associatibn' {this «morning

. 'ay” have serious effects on State‘College. - .

' I 'With the end of the semeSter,'the second issue
of the Primer has not yet been published. There
are several reasons for this situation. Though edi-
,_torial copy has been in the hands of Capitol Press

1 for several weeks, the lack of funds 111.1116 Primer
budget has made it impossible to publish as plan-

:T, ned. However, according to a provnion. in the

 contract, the publication must come out in June.

 {In the early part of the week, the remaining amount

‘1 "in? Primer’s budget of $80 was paid the printer who

‘has at the present time begun work on his own

responsibility. According to the contract, with each
issue $250 should be turned over to the PI‘ll'IleI'.fOI'
ads by the advertising agent before publication.
This amount was given to the staff for the first
issue but in the form of a rubber check which bounc-
ed. Consequently, to pay the printing fee for the
first edition, money appropriated for the second
edition had to be used. Because of this lack of
tum-in on the ads for the last issue, the staff does
not have the money for the second. .

Before condemning anyone, let us wander the
facts and what can be done. First of all, we must
print the second issue with all ads that have been
contracted by the advertising agent or be liable
to the advertisers for refunds which might amount
to as much as $2,000. Secondly, other campus pub-
lications may suffer in the future as a result of
poor business dealings. Thirdly, we would be
guilty of a breach of faith to the advertisers if
we proceeded to print a cheaper Primer which
might appear as some sort of comic book.

A motion will be introduced this morning for
an appropriation of $520 from this year’s surplus
to cover the additional cost of printing this second
issue. With the request, they will propose to delete
$864 from the Primer line in next year’s budget.
The purpose of this contingency fund is to pro-
vide for liability in case the need arises.

Student Association should remember that even
with this $520 the staff will have to spend the
greater part of the next few weeks working at.the
printers in order to get the publication out on time.
The staff is sacrificing their next year’s budget to
get themselves out of a jam—let’s try to go along
with them and understand the situation.

As a solution to these problems, let us review the
budget figures and recognize the necessity for a
1948-’49 tax of $17. The submitted budget calls
for a total of $19,198.

Let us assume that on the basis of 1,300 under-
graduate students, we add the $1.25 per person
increase for the Pedagogue and estimate an ap‘
proximate $750 for the possible amount of liability
that may be incurred from the Primer ads. This
total of $21,573 divided by the number of expected
fully-paid student tax fees sets the tax at $16.60
for next year. However, since it is the procedure
that the tax be set at the nearest dollar in order
to avoid mistakes in making change . . . thus a tax
of $17 for next year. This is the only logical solu-
tion to a serious financial problem.

Dear Mom: I wonder too how much they’ll

That song is all wrong. Spring
doesn’t go busting out all over, at
least not at State. It kinda creeps
in at all the apertures, like windows,
doors, and the hole in the Dean’s
head.

I wonder if the Seniors will miss
the same things I will? Like watch-
Ing the effects of the season on the
faculty? F'r‘instance, a Poll Sci
teacher abandoned Federal Regu-
lation and delivered an hour's lec-
ture on the best fertilizer for rose
bushes.

Another one must have gotten
jealous of Toni’s whistle, so he's
trying to compensate by wearing a
dynamic yellow tie. emblazoned with
a gorilla. He has a definite interest
in one of the young woman instruc-
tors. She, however. with academic
sexiness. keeps trying to lure the
coach into schedule conferences.
This, Mom, Is Education!

miss Moving-Up Day. a day of para-
doxes and contradictions. It‘s a day
when much cynicism disappears.
It’s also a day many learn first
hand what disappointment is.

Most of us move up in more ways
than one, principally to a greater
degree of maturity, Yet that’s a
contradiction too. For on that night
many of us choose to forget our
hard-won maturity, and go out and
make drunken fools of ourselves.
Don't get me wrong, Mom. “I love
parties!” But I don’t at all love
this attitude that Moving-Up Day
gives one the right to chuck all
personal responsibility for a few
hours.

Open Letter to the Student'Faculty
Committee of Student Council:

State is a teacher-training insti-
tution. It is also a college. and as
such, sitppOsedly offers a college
curriculum (with emphasis on sub-
jects of practical value to teachers).
Gradually, students are becoming
more and more aware of the des-
perate lnadequacy. indeed of the
actual myth. of educational prep-
oration.

According to the present system,

three years of “education” are in- 1"

chided in the State College curricu-
lum: one year is devoted entirely
to psychology. According to all
available educational authorities. Ii.
sound psychological background is
Imperative to successful teaching. A
teacher must not only understand
his own psychological function: lie
must be able to understand . . . and
to counsel his students.

The "State" student. nevertheless,
finds himself in a genuinely om-
barnssiiig position. His training in
psychology, as well as being far
below college~levcl generally, is even
below hiin school psyc-course
standards. His Sophomore psychol-
ogy class was not a class; it was a
"forum", a discussion group. Here
the instructor vied with students on
questions of ethics, morality and
"human-nature". The student was
equipped with text books that were
at the same time out-moded and
tin-scientific. Student and instruc-
tor oxehanged anecdotal incidentals.
. and the student was permitted
to conclude that "psychology" is
just common sense. At the same
time, in colleges throughout the
country. (both technical and lib-
eral arts.) students are attending

basic. required courses in scientific
psychology.

In short, the "State" graduate has
not even been exposed to valuable
principles of personal psychology.
Topics such as emotional deviation.
sex and family life, have been, if
not minimized . . . completely lg-
nored, How is he going to approach
his profession with a “sound. psy-
chological outlook"?

As students of a State Teachers
college. we feel that we are entitled

l. A college-level course in empir—
Ical psychology.

2. Modern. scientific text books
and reference material.

3. Laboratory sessions in prac-
tical psychology.

We feel that constructive criti-
cism of the curricula should be
recognized by the administration:
and that the Student-faculty Com-
mittee should represent us in this
matter.

We hold that as students, we
are being deprived of necessary.
available knowledge: and that as
citizens of New York. our educa-
tional system Ls being Jeopardized

Back-stage the affairs of' State
are running just as smoothly. Grieco
spent hours the other night mixing
paints in order to get just the
right shade of brown for some?!
the scenery. Miss..1i‘utt,erer was..er
from pleased with the.",'results,’;lint
before the endj of the ‘con'fer‘e'iiiih.
she gave a. cry of glee and shouted,
“Marie. the colorv.of your __shoes.,.,is
just what We need.” The problem
was solved, so don't criticize Marie
if she doesn’t change her foot ap-
parel from now on.

ence has proven that a bad re-
