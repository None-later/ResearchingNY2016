Movind-Up Day may now be
Just a thing of the past but we
cant letdt'slip back into oblivion
(don't let the word bother you—-
we Just happened to pick it up)
without recalling some of its su-
preme moments. A short resume
of these would include . , . The
disappointed looks of the “Blue
Jays" as the Freshmen passed
through the Junior lines instead
of- under their friendly (we use
the word only under the great-
est pressure from the Sophomore

from the somber Seniors as

the traditional “As You Sow, So

-Shall You Reap” and a baby

‘ crawled out on the gym floor . . .
The dirge-iike walk of Myskania

impression that they were lead-

they marched up the aisle to tap

Intercollegiatle competition this year
The basketball
team came up with a 7-8 record
a inst two wins the year before.
N...th Adams dropped two to the
Statesman while Utica and IPlatts-
burg split with the home team. The
Varsity took wins in single games

Fitchburg.‘ Varsity bowling made its
debut. State took a good third, only
two games behind league-leading
Siena.

This spring there is Baseball,
Tennis, and Golf. Coach Hatha-
way’s nine took its opener 3-1, from
Pharmacy. Since then the compet-
ition has been a little rougher but
several of the games have been
close. The golf team had one win
to their credit over ABC and the
tennis team is improving fast.

State To Meet
ABC Ball Team
This Afternoon

Varsity Bows To Siena
In Return Game, 9-4

State's baseball team is ready to
unleash its power against ABC to-
day at Lincoln Park-43:30. The
statesmen, behind Farley’s pitch-
ing, are out to avenge an early sea-
son defeat by ABC. Last Wednes-
day Siena topped State 9-4.

In the Siena tilt Farley pitched
for State and Tawsey toed the
mound for Siena. With Siena up
first, Farley got into trouble as two
men got on base with only one
away. However, Hank got Stopera
to hit into a double play—Carter to
Duffus to Warden to end the inn-
ing. 1n State‘s hulf B111 Englehart
singled with one away but was left
on the basepaths, as George and
Warden failed to connect. In the
third Siena scored on an error, a
fielder‘s choice, and a hit. State
took the lend when Engiehart got
his second of three hits, George
walked, Warden singled, and two
runs came in on Duifus' hard hit
ball that got past the sli01'tst0p for
an error.

Siena Takes Lead

Siena then tied up the game and
went out in front as they scored at
least one run in most of the final
innings. Their big blast came in the
sCVcii'h when the first two men up
got on base and then Riccio, Siena’s
shortstop, belted a home run that
sailed over Marzello‘s head in deep
left, field, Slate came back with a
tally in the eighth on Carter's tri-
ple with Dickinson on base, and one
in the last on hits by Farley and
Mai'zollo and Englehart‘s long fly
to right.

On last Friday, State's game with
Piuilsburg was rained out. Yester-
duy State met Pharmacy in their
second meeting of the season. State
won the previous game 3 to 1.

In today's battle, Farley will prob—
ubly pitch us the varsity will try to
wipe out the 7-6 defeat that the
ABCcrs handed to State behind
Philo‘s pitching. Monday State plays
(.nion at Lincoln Park—3:30.
