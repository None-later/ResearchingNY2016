tisement at the time of publication.

,Student Association budget, based
on an expected 1300 undergraduate
enrollment, will cover this amount
with the proposed #17 student ac-
tivities fee. The submitted IMO-’49
budget minus the Primer line is
$19,198.00. With the proposed in-
crease oi‘ $1.25 from Pedagogue, to
insure a yearbook for every student
who pays the student activities fee,
there will be $1,625.00, based on 1300
undergraduate enrollment. The pos-
sible amount which may be needed

which may not be printed in the
second issue 0! Primer has been es-
timated at 8750, since 0760 in ad-
vertisement copy has been received
by the staff. These figures total
$21,573.00. which would be divided
among a.1300 enrollment to $16.60.
or a $17 student activities fee, which
will provide $527 breakage. This
$527, plus the $750 refund estimate,
will give us a minimum planned

WHY...I smoke Chesterﬁeld

(FROM A SERIES OF STATEMENTS BY PROMINENT TOBACCO FARMERS)

“I think Chesterfield is a good-smoking cigarette
and I like them. They have a good, ripe-tobacco taste

“Nobody pays a higher price to get good-smoking
tobacco than Chesterfield. They buy sweet, ripe tobacco.
Looks like a gold dollar in the bane. ”
