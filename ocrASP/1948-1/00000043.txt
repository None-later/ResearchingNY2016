English Professor Glimpses
Life In These United States

On campus this week was Miss
Shirley Gordon, of the history
staff, University of London, who
is touring the United States
visiting American teachers' col-
leges. She finds the system here
(at State Institutions for future
teachers) comparable to the
system now being pursued in
the British Isles.

She tells us that although the
English campuses land com-
monsi are not quite as popu—
lated with the highest form of
life, (homo sapiens, that isi vets
on campus are numbered among
the many.

Like us. future teachers en—
rolled in the University of Lon—
don spend three years on their
stamping grounds, icampus, to
those who know but, unlike us,
they all spend their senior year
practice teaching somewhere out
in the great nowhere.

Emphasis on social fitness and
inaturiiy. rather than on aca-
demicism, is greater. thinks
Miss S. G.
