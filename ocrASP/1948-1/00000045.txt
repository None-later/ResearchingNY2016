Religious Club
To Hold Meeting

The Christian Science Organiza-
tion will open a year‘s program of
activities with its first regular
meeting Tuesday evening in Room
109, Draper Hall, at 7:30 PM. A
business meeting will follow.

The regular meetings of this or-
ganization are conducted on alter-
nate Tuesdays of the term, and its
members extend an invitation to
the entire student body and faculty
to attend. For the information of
those not acquainted with the na-
ture and purposes of this organi-
zation, the group functions prim-
arily as a religious, and not a social
body. According to Wayne Pal-
mer ’49, President, the organization
desires to aid the Christian Sci-
entists of the college, and any
others who are interested, to gain
a better understanding of the truth
about Christian Science as set forth
in the Bible and the Christian Sci-
ence Textbook, and, accordingly,
conduct meetings after the order
for Wednesday evening meetings
set forth in the Manual of The
Mother Church, by Mary Baker
Eddy.

Smiles Schedules
C hildren's Party

At the first meeting of Smiles.
plans were formulated for a party
to be given by the children of the
Albany Home for Children for the
students of State College, Sunday,
October 10. The children have sug-
gested such a party as a token of
appreciation for the efforts put
forth in their behalf by the stu-
dents of the college. They have,
however, asked for help from the
Smiles Committee and Susan Panek
’51 has been placed in charge of
this function. At the party, those
students who have never visited the
home will be taken to the various
cottages so that they may meet the
children.

Also under discussion at the
meeting were plans for continuing
the Saturday morning trips to the
WROW radio program for children
The tentative date for the start of
this program has been set for Sat-
urday, October 9, with Claramartha
Brown heading the committee in
charge of chaperones.

“I want something New York
knows nothing about." This was Mr.
Roswell Fairbanks speaking to the
Junior Ed 10 class Wednesday aft-
ernoon. Mr. Fairbanks, Commerce
Supervisor at Milne, with five other
supervisors of departments of Milne
presented his ideas of what the av-
erage student needs in subject mat-
ter before graduating from any Ain-
erican secondary school.

Mr. Fairbanks presented the idea
of compulsory commerce courses in
junior high in the field of con-
sumer education of one semester
and more in high school. He stated
as one of his arguments that stu-
dents who might fall victim of the
advertising system would know more
about it by taking these courses.

Every child should have a social
studies class every day he‘s in high
school, said Dr. Wallace Taylor,
supervisor in Social Studies. He bc-
lieves that thirty-five minute pe-
riodv should be lengthened to sixty
and that knowledge of social stu-
dies is necessary for everyday liv-
ing and for. better human relations.

According to Miss Mary E. Conk-
lln, Supervisor in English, a stu-
rh-nt should develop skills, habits
and attitudes in English that will
continue to be hclpful throughout

a high school student should learn
and develop skills in speaking, writ-
ing, and in reading of literature.

Miss Florence E. Rannes, Super-
visor ln Foreign Languages, convey-
ed the idea that in junior high
school pupils should take two years
of some foreign languages in order
that they might discover their own
abilities. and reulizc that there are
p-ople in the world speaking other
languages than English.

“A pupil should understand the
knowledge he consumes and the
commonplace things which surround
him in life.” Dr. Carleton Moose,
Supervisor in Science, at the meet-
ing stated that compulsory science
courses of this practical nature are
necessary in the junior high curric-
ulum and that higher science cours-
es should be available for those
with leadership qualities in the scl-
cntlfic field.

Dr. Randolph Gardner, Supervi-
sor in Mathematics. stated that a
student in junior high should learn
about practical mathematics and
get some idea of higher mathema-
tics. Howcvcr, those taking higher
nuithcmutics should have ability and
inicrcsi.
