PAOE 2

Seesaw .  .

The Presidential election draws nearer . . . hot
and heavy are the discussions in the halls and a-
round Campus . . . the students at State College
seem to have the greatest variation in their opinions
concerning the suitable person for the Presidency.

Groups of students went to hear Truman speak
this morning; many others attended the Wallace
rally a few weeks ago; some feel that the New York
Governor is the man for the job: and then, there are
the others who have loaded our mailboxes with
those important sheets of yellow matter. Student’s
names have appeared on these yellow sheets as
sponsors of the Norman Thomas meeting in Chan-
ning Hall. Onlookers have questioned whether this
sort .of thing should be placed in our school mail-
boxes. It’s the old story of future teachers
of America which may seem a bit trivial to some
students but which is still something with which
there must be concern in a teachers’ college. '

Teachers must be open-minded but they cannot
afford being open-minded to the point of harming
the profession. Outsiders . , both former students
of State College and educators of the State . . . show
a great deal of interest in the polls which are con-
ducted concerning such questions.

To determine the political stand of the Student
Association, a straw vote will be conducted in as-
sembly Friday, October 22. This election will give
those people a chance to vote who are not yet of
age and will also be of interest because of the num-
bers of those who will be voting in the national e-
lection. Statistics will be Computed according to the
voters, non-voters, and individual classes.

The NEWS is the last organization in the world
to tell anyone how they should vote but general
opinion seems to have it that there are a few people
who should consider their ballot a little more wisely
rather than diving head-ﬁrst for a. new idea, a new
party, a new candidate . . . anything to be different
and to shock the more conservative straight-laced
members of the student body and faculty.

Your ballot is yours both in the school and na-
tional election. Regardless of what is said in this
editorial, people will vote as they please . . . but
at least, those who are swaying from one candidate
to another, don't be swayed until you are convinced
of the reasons you are voting for a candidate . . .
don’t be swayed by other individuals but only
through your own thoughts and opinions.

Attend, Please I

Students of Albany State will be. guests of the
children at the Albany Home this Sunday afternoon
for the ﬁrst time since the SMILES organization
was originated.

All the work that has been done in the past could
be undone by the failure of representation from
State. Publicity has been given the party over
WROW and Mayor Corning and a representative
from the Knickerbocker News are expected to
attend.

The very least we can do is to give them the sup-
port they must have and attend the party Sunday.

’ 71.. he,» mi 7/... Arm

By SPARK! VAUGHN

 

I wuz sittln' in the store the oth-
er day playin' checkers an we wuz
all had up ’bout this comin’ 'lection
fer Presedent of these Yewnited
States. I ups and says to my ole
neighbor. Bill Barnstead, "Bill," I
Seas, “how yew ﬁxin’ ta vote cum
’lection day?”

"Wall," he sezs, “don’t rightly
know; who’s runnin'? Teddy Roose-
velt was gud 'nuff for Paw and I
recon he oughta be gud ’nuff for
me.”

“Wall, I had a noospaper with me
an I tole Bill an my other neighbors
there was sum young whippersnap-
pers runnin’ this time; namely Tru—
man, Thomas, Dewey and Wallace.
Sowe thot it wuld be rite schrewd
of us’uns to investigot how godd
they wuz.

So, we ups and gits us the school
master, us nacherly ﬁggurin' 1m to
know the mostest—and we asks im,
“Homer boy, yew ben edjecated an
yew knows sumthln' 'bout this
wurld. It wuld be rite kind if yew
wuz to clar we'uns up on this here
‘lection."

“Well boys, the more you know
the more confused you can become.
Let’s start with Dewey and his Re~
publicans. He seems to be a very
capable administrator, and at this
point it looks as if he’s a sure bet
to win."

“Wall thar,” pipes in Clem, “jest
whut‘s the use in votin’ then?"

“You see Clem. we not only vote
for candidates, but also for princi-
pies and ideals. You must also know
what the Republicans stand for,
Civil Rights, relaxation of govern-
ment controls—-"

“Duz thot mean the government
wuld stop supportin’ the price of my
grain? I wuldn't vote fer thot.
“Whut 'bout this here Henry Wal-
lace? He's a farmer jest like us
ain’t he?"

"We can’t be sure what Wallace
stands for; He probably isn‘t sure
himself. He just doesn’t trust the
people to go through war and de-

pression and remain a democracy.
He does not know the strength of
the people."

“Whut wuld the Democrats do fer
us? We like Harry fine but we ain't
happy 'bout the way things are."

“There is little difference. The
major one is that the Democrats
stand for repeal of the Taft-Hart-
ley Law."

“Whut's that,” asks Silas Sr.

“That was an attempt by our
Congress to balance the scales be-
tween labor and capital."

Ole Bill jumps up and seyz, “My
Paw tole me ’bout the times when
he wuz a jest startin’ out in this
country: 'Bout the soot and sech
’fore he come to be a farmer. La-
bors been nigh on a hundert yars
glttin' nuff wages to hev a family
and some time to ﬁsh now an then."

“Them that labor unions got tew
big fer thar britches," says Silas.

“We haven’t yet found how big
to make britches for labor and how
big for business."

“Kin we be shure that if'n we do
vote fer a party, they'ns 71 do whut
we'uns 'r votin' fer 'em to do?"

“As for the President, Woodrow
Wilson Is quoted as saying that
campaign platforms are just cam-
paign oratory. That's usually about
the sum of it. The philosophy of our
major parties is a philosophy of
meeting the situation of the ino-
ment—and of getting votes. For
philosophy of government we must
look elsewhere. for it has been in!-
nor groups and minor interests who
from time to time have stood forth
and altered the course of the Re-
public. .

"Norman Thomas, a minor candi-
date with a major platform, repre—
sents such a group. His platform of
a generation ago is adopted and ac-
cepted today. However. it is still a
gamble to vote for him and prob-
ably lose the vote."

“Wall, thank'ee kindly Homer: I
ain't ready to vote but I'm gonna do
sum thinkin' ‘fore I do.

FOR. STATE

Tomorow is Activities Day, when the freshmen are
given the opportunity to enroll themselves on the ros-
ters of tryouts and members of State’s extra-curricular
organizations. Working for these different outﬁts can
be of great value to you. It’s the beginning of your
college social life and one heckuva good time. This is
your chance to help yourself while you work for State
College; let’s see you take advantage of it.

Incidentally—you Sophs and Juniors—it's not too
late for you to start doing your part. It’ll certainly
never hurt you to know how to run an extra-curricular
activity when you get out teaching. Why not give
yourself a break and drop around tomorrow between
i and 4 pm?

GIVE THE KIDS A BREAK

Sunday, the kids at the Albany Home for Children
are throwing their ﬁrst party for outsiders. Every
other time they've been the guests; now it's their
show. Lots of Albany B.T.O.'s have been invited to
attend, but we, the State students. are the ones the
kids are so anxious to see again.

I dropped over there a couple of weeks ago to see
my little three-year old friend, Terry Shultz. Terry
says, “I wanna see Kay an' Jeannie an’ Lyle an'
EV'YBODY!"

At the last Smiles party I saw only about ﬁfteen
State students, each trying to be a pal to a dozen
kids. Let's all go this time, so that there will be a doz-
en of us to each child; it'll make them ever so happy.

LEAVE WELL ENOUGH ALONE

Some students aren't satisﬁed with last week’s de-
cision on Myskania‘s ruling that freshmen will not
vote in the Vice-presidential election. Obviously,
something is missing in our constitution. when such a
heated controversy arises. As it was carried out last.
week, the 2/3 majority ruled that Myskania's decision
be upheld; this is the democratic way to do it. Steps
are now being taken to fill up the loopholes in the
constitution, so that this may not happen again. It's
our duty to follow the ruling of the majority and to
take the necessary preventative measures. The unsat-
isﬁed members should not be foolish enough to hold
up attempts to rectify matters any longer.

LOOKOUT: RAILROAD

Lots of remarks are going the rounds about ‘poli—
ticians" who are "operating" for candidates for the
coming Student Association Vice-presidential and
freshmen presidential elections. I don‘t know to what.
extent these remarks are true. but I'd like to make. a
comment before the candidates are even nominated; 1
don‘t want to throw any bad light on the wrong
people.

A way to check on the candidates is to watch for
the clean campaign. the person who will talk straight
organization business to anybody and everybody. Look
for the nominees who make a full campaign; they're
the ones who are showing that they're really inter-
ested and have the initiative to carry out the job.

Keep your eyes and ears Wide open. Don't be taken
for a ride on the well-known railroad.

WHO'S WHO

While we‘re on the subject of elections, a word
about the Who's Who nominations should be meri—
tioned. Last year, in this writer‘s opinion, several pco-
plc, unconsciously or otherwise, offered the names of
some completely undeserving individuals. Let's not
make a farce of this one. Give credit where credit is
due; award this honor to those seniors who have
really earned it.

I‘LEASE:: . . .

I have a little persona! plea. While in possession of
the Class of '50 last year. the Campus Day cup dis-
appeared. If any 01' you know of its whereabouts, will
you please contact. me or Sparky Vaughn as soon as
possible.

BACK TO NATURE

A couple of weeks back I urged everybody to do his
best to help Campus Commission in its job to keep our
campus clean. That still goes, but now that their reg-
ulations are published. I find it necessary to disagree
partially. Get a load of sections DJ) and 0-5. I don't
know. but I learned in Ed 10 that. it‘s all quite normal.
Should such things be put in writing? We're grown up,
now, C. C. V

.Beoi Siena Five

The Varsity Bowling quintet in-
augurated the 1948-49 Intercolleg-
iate season last Wednesday night by
taking two out of three games from
Siena at the Playdium. After grab-
bing the ﬁrst two games by a wide
margin, State dropped the last one
by twenty-six pins.

Fran Mullin put together games
of 219-171-195 for a three game tot-
al of 585 to lead both teams in that
department. His 219 effort was also
high single game for the evening.
Following Mullin were Joe Carosel-
19. who rolled a neat 525, and Don
MacDonald, with 375 total for two
games.

Carosella Elected Captain

Before the match, Joe Carosella
was elected captain of the varsity
ﬁve, and will guide the team
through its second season in the In-
tercollegiate League. Several prom-
ising new-comers have tried out
for State along with last year's vet-
erans: Fran Mullin, Hank Farley,
Lyle Walsh. Joe Carosella and Diz
Dickinson. Tryouts continue this
week.

Next week, State will meet RPI
for the ﬁrst time this year. Strong
college support will be appreciated,

Take St. Mary's
Rockets 32-0,6-0

SLS and Van Derzee started the
Intramural football season on its
way by taking games from the
Rockets and St. Mary’s last Wednes-
day. The Finks met KDR. and the
Angels took on the Ramblers
Thursday.

Van Derzee, sparked by a fast
moving back field of Wiley, Peene.
and Morlarity, and a fast moving
line, easily took St. Mary's in hand
by the count of 32-0. Using the “T”
formation. Van Derzee proved to
be too fast and smooth for the los-
ers. Taking to the air time and time
again, the winners marched up the
field on sustained drives. The
smooth passing was offset by the
fact that three of the five touch-
downs were scored by long runs
with Moriarlty carrying.

Score Twice on Passes

The route was sparked by a
short touchdown pass, Wiley to
Powell, in the first quarter. The
final scoi'e was made by Stevenson
on the receiving end of a long pass
from Peenc.

 

Rugged Athletes Make New
Changes At Camp Johnston

Ammonia! Brooms! Rags!
Armed with these things, six
ambitious coeds set off Sunday
morning in “Honeybunch” to
clean Camp Johnston—WAA's
weekend retreat in Chatham.
New improvements promised to
make a stay there more com-
fortable, that is, as soon as a
key is found for the front door
and the pump works.

Dust lay thick on everything,
but three hours were long
enough to sun mattress, pile up
wood. and even dislodge the
hornet nests. Lunch was served
in true Camp Johnston style—
peanut butter, and jam sand-
wiches. The drinking water was
slightly flavored, not tea bags,
21 grasshopper!

Returning to Albany, the
weary workers noticed autumn’s
glory (apple season). “It’s a
shame to let all this out here
go to waste!” It wasn’t wasted.
What a delicidus apple pie
Mrs. Nye madel

 

SLS won its first game over the competition UHdCTWiY

Rockets of Saint Mary's at Bever-
wyck Park by a 6-0 score. The
heavy hard hitting line of the victors
combined with the accurate pass-
ing of the backfield. proved too
much for the Rockets. Roulier and
Towcy did the passing while Grif-
fen received for SLS to account for
the SL8 victory.

The lightness of the Rockets was
very noticeable against the heavier
line of the SL5 squad. Cummings
and Lein of the Rockets showed in-
dications of becoming a good run-
ning and passing combination.
Week's Schedule

The schedule for next week's
games is as follows:

MONDAY
Saints vs KB
Ham & Eggers vs SL8
TUESDAY
KDR Vs Gents
EEP vs Finks
