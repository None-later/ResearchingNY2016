State Teachers Activities Day 3W“

 

To The Editor:

A painting, in my opinion, is a
moving sensation and an enjoyable
moment—if it is a painting. It is
disconcerting, to say the least, to
see how low the human torso has
dipped as is evidenced by that atroc-
ity hanging in the student cafeteria.
Beach scenes, by nature, are usually
rather happy ones; to be taunted
by that spindle-shanked, ‘gaunt ho-
mo-sapien passing himself of! as a
male is more than the ordinary lov-
er of art can countenance. He ap-
pears to be modeling for a sand
statue, or else, waiting for the sea.
to put him out of his misery.

Why, even the most elementary
rules of safety have been ignored:
to wit, a banana peel is strewn near
the path of the running girl at the
left of the pseudo-mural. And what
apears to be a boat, resembles more
closely a mummie’s cofﬁn—which
incidentally should have been en-
larged so as to encompass the en-
tire eyesore. It wouldn’t surprise me
to see some morning a doughnut
hanging close by that gaunt and e-
maciated male’s lips.

Why not replace it with something
a bit more easier on the peekers?
Burt Jablon. '51

Frosh Buy Dates, Sign For Seals, Religious Clubs To 
Annual Picnic Thursday

During Colorful

The Freshmen were “taken in"
to the activities of State College
last Saturday—and in more ways
than extracurricular.

The Class of '51 took in an all-
time record of $56. It seems that
their only difficulty during the day
was discouraging unknowing up-
perclassmen from being fleeced.
Past records prove that the class
of '50 made only $25.05, and the
Red Devrls of '49 got a mere $12.40.
Statistically speaking, the Yellow
Jackets ought to crack $100 next
year.

$26.80 worth of Frosh paid ad-
mission to the Commons and the
Soph skit, $3.59 worth took chan-
ces on a toy dog which was won by
Eleanor Butler, '51. A donation of
$1.55 was made for the movement
towards inter - sorority — fraternity
housing.

ter coeducational relationships, re-
