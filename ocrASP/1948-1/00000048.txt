In Reply . . .

Editor’s note.‘ This editorial is written as a fat-
low up of last week’s editorial and also as a reply
to the letter to the editor printed below.

Editorials as well as columns are written for the
purpose of expressing opinion. Any newspaper has
as its goal the reporting of news but it also has its
duty as far as the editorial page is concerned. It is
not expected that there will be complete agree-
ment concerning any one person’s opinion in any
instance. If there were agreement with all edi-
torials, the editorials would be pretty poor. How-
ever, the reading public is theoretically supposed
to discuss, disagree, and debate opinions with the
idea that in turn their own 'opinions will be formed
either in agreement with or contrary to that of the
editorial writer.

Last week an open picture of the situation as it
exists within our walls was presented and there was
a plea for each and every student to decide how he
feels politically. The Socialist Party bore the brunt
of the attack simply because its actions had been
the most obvious example of the demonstrations
which are disturbing to the general public. It was
the idea that was being attacked, not the Party
itself. If the Progressive Party had caused similar
talk at the time, it would have been the one
attacked. As is stated in both the editorial and the
letter below, the focus was on those people
tinged with radical views who blindly “dive head
first” for something new, and who do not in the
least recognize themselves as teachers.

Anyone who has been the least bit interested in
the promotion of State College has been fully 21-
ware that relations between the college and the city
of Albany have not always been what they should
be. It is only in the past year that the local papers
have begun to cooperate in any way to publicize
State College and not constantly to have somethingr
derogatory to say about that State institution up
on the hill. Anything that has been done could be
undone very easily. Teachers are subject to criti-
cism throughout the world but Albany itself seems
especially prone to this sort of thing.

In America we supposedly can express our views
as we wish. But in what profession can individuals
who want to be successful at all feel free to speak
on "each and every issue" they wish? Let's be a
little more realistic. People will disagree with this
statement but common sense is the key towards
realizing that we do not have complete freedom
of speech.

There is another eason for watching our step
just a little bit more. Our bread and butter lie
down the street only about four blocks away. Com-
plaints have been heard in the past concerning ra-
dical statements which have gone forth from “ye
olde Draper Hall". This paper is more widely read
than many people imagine, and we are laying our-
selves wide open for criticism.

Generally tolerant attitudes of the majority of
SA members have prevented us from taking a deft-
nite NEWS Board stand. in many college papers.
deﬁnite stands are taken for or against political
candidates.

However, the opinions expressed in last wcek's
editorial were not the mad ideas of one individual
but the ideas that have been discussed by various
representative groups from the college. Those of
you who have been so concerned about the edItor-
ial should for a moment turn back to the “broad-
mindeduess” and at least listen to the arguments
of another side before flying off the handle.

STATE COLLEGE NEWS. FRIDAY. OCTOBER '15. 1948

 

 

. Let as cost aside those happy as-
persions that the lines of differen-
tiation between the major political
parties are striking—no, the party
platforms are too parallel for votes
to be determined in so facile a
manner. Excepting those faultless
few who will vote according to
heritage, 1948’s voters will vote ac-
cording to issues.

I—INTERNAL

“Labor” and “inﬂation” are nec-
essarily the political footballs of
an election year. As ‘protected’ stu-
dents, we IUCklly do not need to
consider our sociological category as
a guide to our voting. We can NOT.
however, forget Truman's pseudo-
veto of the Taft-Hartley law—a ve-
to which was paradoxically con-
ﬁrmed by Barkley’s advice to the
Senate—“to vote as you please.
The president. pre-supposing an
“override,” had accomplished a pol-
ished political maneuver. BUT the
result is a bi-partisan labor stand:
Dewey and Truman stand side by
side on the political axis—preserv-
ing a minimum of corporate tax
and a maximum of corporate proﬁt.
Unlimited proﬁteering is the main-
spring of inflation.

II—INTERNATIGNAL

Somewnere in the nucleusof con-
fused policymakers, we have ceased
critical analysis of world affairs.
ALL parties have advocated whole-
hearted ENDORSEMENT of the U.
N. That; endorsement has been ac-
companied by a bi-partisan foreign
policy which calls for an “American
Front" within the UN and a Mar-
shall Plan which, even according to
a very conservative GOP from Ver-
mont (Flanderst is . . . “diverted
from its original plans of European
Relief into a means of rearmlng
Europe.” Such a bi-purtisan policy
accomplishes a false national “Uni-
ty”—a unity involving “hate Rus-
sia" as the foothold for world pol-
icy. To approach an international

conference with an organized front
is to divide the world and to dis-
avow even the opportunity for
world peace.

Soobsessed is this front, that we
have ignored tremendous interna-
tional happenings. Vishinsky’s at-
omic control plan and his disarma-
ment. proposal represent, surely, an
effort at compromise. (A compro—
mise that. could as easily have been
issued from American lips) —— this
plan exhibits fabulous recessioan
from original USSR attitude. We
have “debunked” them with the
skeptical categorization of “tricks”
—and have proceeded to concen-
trnte outﬁefforts on greater military
development.

Nor, can we forget that the very
existence of the Marshall Plan’s

~unllateraiism nulliﬁes any positive

U. S. interest; in an International
organization.

So while the GOP Congress and
Democratic administration played
at killing our most wonderful liber-
ty in creating negativism of a vir-
tual spy hysteria, Henry Wallace
stood alone in advocating negotia-
tion with Russia—41 positive effort
toward world peace and assuredly
tangible support of the United Na-
tions.

“But Wallace can‘t Icinwwhy
throw (“any a vote . . ." That is
naive thinking: a substantial Dem~
ocratic vote in the face of an inev-
itable GOP victory would not no-
ticeably affect the policy of the
party in power. False veins and bi-
partisanism contradict that. theory.
ONLY a strong Wallace vote can
prove to our policy creators that
American people want—or rather
NEED peace.

We must; shy away from “stick-
to-home" blindness. We echo Dr.
Rienow's plea that—“to put anoth-
er nation before your own is to be
a traitor BUT hardly is it that to
put the WORLD above personal
identity."

To the Editor:

Last week as I read the NEWS, I
was shocked to discover that the
editorial columns of our student
paper had been used to advance a
.personal. partisan attack against
the campaign techniques and the
individual irresponsibility of mem-
bers of one of the more alert. and
active strident political groups on
our campus. I ﬁrmly believe that
points of disagreement with this
party and all other parties should
be discussed publicly and publi-
cized fully. I further believe that
any strident, however high and re-
sponsible his position in the student.
body. should feel perfectly free to
speak out. both on and off campus,
on each and every issue. no matter
how controversial It may be: but I
am opposed to the use of the name,
prestige, and privileges of an e-
lccted or appointed office by any
student to advocate that a stand
should be taken for or against any
political candidate or party.

In spite of attacking the pro-
prlcty of editorial presentallon of
this important; issue. I hope that.
every student of this college will
turn to that editorial again. and
study its message very carefully. I
hope that as students read the re-
mark, “It's the old story of future
teachers of America which may

seem trivial to some,“ that they will
feel obliged to discover exactly who
the “some” are that. have the triv-
ial attitude and superficial ap-
proach to the problems of education
and social organization. Are they
the people who have become bogged
down in the swamps of habit. cau-
tiousness. and past mistakes: or are
they the people who have the cour-
age to come out for “a new idea. It
new party, a new candidate“ with
the determination to end the ex~
ploitntion of man by man? Are
they the people who interpret the
actions of others in terms of
“shocking people" or are they the
people who believe that the Amer-
ican ideal of striving towards great-
er freedom is just. as important to-
day ns It was in the revolt against
the tyranny of English kings or the
struggle to destroy the power of
Southern slave—holders?

Unless some of the "more con-
servative straight-luced members of
the student body and faculty" start
"diving head-flrst for a new idea"
to meet new atomic-age problems,
they may soon find themselves, in
unprofesslotutl haste. diving head-
first for a new bomb shelter.

Sway oh you wont. Your ballot;
is yours. don't be coerced or intim-
iduted.

THE SMOKER

I’m certainly glad I could make the Inter-Fratern-
ity Smoker last Friday. There was a good turnout of
fraternity men and freshmen. The boys put, on an
hilarious show, and demonstrated the true spirit of
fair play and good fellowship that comes with fra-
ternity membership. It. did something to me to watch
the various groups get together and sing their re-
spective songs, all as though they honestly meant the
words.

The Frosh are being wise in making an effort to
get acquainted with everybody this time; they won't.
have to be sorry later on for any mistakes in judg-
ment now. So far, so good. Give it everythth you’ve
got, boys. but keep it; clean.

BETTER AND BETTER

Good news from D&A Council: Not only are we
getting Margaret Webster’s production of “Macbeth”,
but they are giving a matinee-evening performance
of both “Macbeth” and “Hamlet” on November 5.
This will give everybody an opportunity to indulge in
Shakespeare, directed by the woman who is con-
sidered just about the best director of Shakespeare
in the States.

BE NOT COVETOUS

There's nothing more irritating than to go to the
cafeteria at noon, only to ﬁnd a dozen or more. empty
seats all saved for somebody’s friend or her friend’s
friend. So you stand up and eat your lunch. You ﬁn~
ish, and the seats are still being saved. probably for
someone who has suddenly decided to eat at the
“Boul”. Never again will I ask for a chair. Unless it.
bar. food before it, it's mine if I get there ﬁrst.
CONGRATS!

It looks as though we backed a really good outﬁt.
in our Ped staff, when we alloted it money to carry
on last Spring. Our yearbook tied for first place with
that of the College of St. Rose in an evaluation of the
annuals of the teacher education colleges in New York
State recently. Here‘s to bigger and better Pcds!
WHAT A SIIINDIGI

It was really a treat to attend the picnic at the
Home last Sunday. I would venture to say that there
were about seventy-ﬁve State students there, all hav-
ing a wonderful time amusing themselves and the
children. You should have seen Earl “Muscles” Sipe
make a sixty yard touchdown run right through a
whole team consisting of Koeky Donnelly. Jenn Mc—
Cabe. Bernie Frcel and a. big-l'or-his-age ﬁve year old.
What. a powerhouse! Terry says, "When is everybody
coming again?"

State’s Varsity Bowling squad
met; R.P.I. for the ﬁrst time this
season in intercollegiate play
Wednesday night. at the Playdium.
After a. close battle, State emerged
the victors. Gaining a split in the
first: two contests, the varsity came
back to take the last. game by the
very narrow margin of six pins.
By taking two out of three in this
match, the statesmen temporarily
eliminated R.P.I. as a ﬁrst place
contender. Before the contest. RF.
1., Albany Business College, and the
State keglers were sharing a three-
way tie for the lead.

Captain Joe Carosella garnered
high individual honors for the ev-
ening with a three game total of
521 including games of 202 and 192.
In the number two spot was Don
McDonald with 498.

Action will resume next Wednes-

Football got. underway again this
week with E.E.P. beating the Flnks
on Tuesday 29-0 and, the Gents
taking K.D.R. 12-6. Rain postponed
the Monday games till a later date.

E.E.P. ran over the Finks with
strong blocking and eloquent pass-
ing which was new to the Finks.
Patti Carter did the pass work for
E.E.P. with Schick and Lansky re-
ceiving. Warden and Lansky also
gained several first downs on long
runs. one which led to a touch-
down in about two minutes of play.

The Gents struggled to victory
over K.D.R. in the last quarter,
making the finishing score 12-6.
Bob Eich carrich and passed for
the Gents and George -Poulos re-
ceived for the last. touchdown which
put them ahead.

Kenny George played fullback,
running anti passing [or the Ham
and Eggers, while Roulier passed
for S.L.S. Both teams had splendid
defensive lines.

Several times the Ham and Egg-
ers penetrated deep into SLS. ter-
ritory only to be held within a yard
of the goal line. Large gains were
made by runs by Kenny George
and O'Brien received several long
passes for added yardage.

S.I..S. pulled a surprise punt on
the first dowr of the third quarter
which put the Lam and Eggcrs on
their own goal-line. However, they
worked out of this without mishap.
and returned the ball to SLS. ter—
ritory.

Van Derzee took off again this
week against the Saints, winning
18-0. Thursday. Although they won
by forfeit. the game was played
with the aid of some pick-up piny-
crs for the Saints.

Spider Pcenc passer] the three
touchdown passes: two to John Ste-
venson and one to John Chagares
who run them over for the TD.
Van Derzcc‘s line seemed too much
for the Saints on the defense.

The, Saints had Bob Brown and
Rny Sanderson carrying the ball
for them in the running plays. Al-
though Brown's pasSing was up to
par little yardage. was made on puss
uys.

RPl Outing Al Greylock Stare
Competition, HIkIn'g And Men

Do you feel glum and tired
out? What you need is fresh air
and exercise. So—into a pair of
jeans and walk over to Pierce.
What for? Don’t tell me you
have not heard. Why it’s the
R.P.I. outing at Greylock, which
means men, competition and
hiking. What more could you
ask for?

The Rensselner Outing Club
(interested now?) is sponsoring
a big "legstretching shindig"
this Sunday. Naturally, the en-
gineers should prove to be ex-
cellent competition for the en—
thusaistic sports women of
State.

The action is slated to start
at 9:15 a. m. and the destination
is the top of Mt. Greylock. Put
your name on the sign-up sheet
which is on the W.A.A. bulletin
board. Bring your lunch, a bun-
dle of energy, and you are guar-
anteed to have fun and two
mangled legs by 12 o’clock.

Tennis And Golf

Intramural tennis anti golf tour—
naments got off to a splashy start

one week to play off each round.
He hopes to finish by November 8.
Coach Hathaway has announced
that the winner will be given a
medal, and his name engraved up-

BOB VAN DAM

After listening to three differ-
ent football games and the world
series, we put in two hours of work
and sent in the ﬁrst Weekly ballot
for Collier’s All-American team.
From now on we’ll send in a weekly
ballot each Saturday night. Each
ballot includes player’s performance
to date. '

 

 

 

 

LE Hart Notre Dame
LT O'Reilly Purdue
LG Fischer Notre Dame
C Yeaman Army .
RG Henry Army
RT Wisert; Michigan
RE Keresulis Illinois
B Tripucka Not‘i‘e Dame
B Justice South Carolina
B Walker S. M. U.
B VanBrocklin Oregon

We chose Hartand Keresulis over
several other outstanding ends, es-
pecially Morten of Notre Dame.
The tackle spots were hard to pick.
However, O’Reilly and Wisert. are
the strong spots in their respective
lines.

Fischer is a demon on defense
and a terriﬁc offensive guard. Some
may disagree with our choice of Yea-
man and Henry, yet in every game
they have led Army’s offense. All
of Army’s large gains have been
through the center of the line.

Though Tripucka may not pass
as well as former Notre Dame quar-
terbacks, he is a cool ﬁeld general.
Justice and Walker have paced
their teams to date. Though South-
ern Methodist lost; last week, Wal-
ker still shone. Van Brocklin paces
an otherwise average Oregon team.
His performance against Michigan
was outstanding.

We tried our best to turn in a.
good ballot. Maybe we’ve missed a
lot of good players so we’ll appre-
clnte any comments or suggestions
from you. Send them in through
the Student Mail or leave them in
the NEWS mailbox.
