New Commons’ Mail Boxes StUdent ASSOCTOtion  
For State's Campus Queen Today

Alleviate Mob Conditions

Have you seen the absolute
latest and by far the greatest
improvement on Campus?

Yessss . . . we mean the mail-
boxes. Daisies to Campus Com-
mission (We can’t ailord or-
chids this year, S. A. hasn’t
allowed for them in the budget.)

Outside of the fact that the
green does not compliment the
present wall color, and also the
fact that their present position
at eye level causes a student to
catch his nose on the top or
bottom every time, the new
mailboxes constitute the most
needed improvement since
metal chairs replaced wooden
ones, saving the nation's nylon
supply.

But, seriously, (sober, that is)
now that we've got real mail-
boxes instead of sawed-off ill—
ing cases with their drawers
missing, let’s- standardize our
notes. It would be nice, too, if
people picked up their mail at
least daily. It may grow mellow
(also moldy) with age, but it
sure clutters those mailboxes!
