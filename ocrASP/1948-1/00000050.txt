Policy . . .

Rehashing something that has been thoroughly
mariticated and digested by the student body dur-
ing the last few weeks is not the wisest thing in the
world to do. However, another letter has been re-
ceived and is printed in this week’s issue pertaining
‘to the subject under discussion—whether or not we,
:as students in a teachers’ college should knock our-
selves out publicly for political ideas and radical
parties.

The NEWS has once again been attacked and
this week more strongly because of its “conserva-
‘ tive, bogged down, political adolescence.” That’s all
a matter of opinion. The NEWS has tried to main-
tain a fairly broad-minded attitude as far as the e-
lection and politics are concerned. Since school be-
gan, we have endeavored through our guest col-
umnists to secure writers each week who would
present a different political opinion and represent
a different party. Last week immediately adjacent
to the editorial attacking radical demonstrations
in a teachers’ college was printed a column which
backed the Young Progressives and Wallace. On
that same page was printed the letter to the editor
expressing a different point of view. This is pre-
cisely what the NEWS is trying to do—express dif-
ferent points of view through its editorials and col-
umns so that the reading public may accept these
opinions for what they are worth and form their
opinions through their own thinking and analysis.

Criticism was made in the letter that “undeﬁned
and skittish references” had been used in the edi-
torial. Likewise, generalizations were made in the
letter. How can any person say that “from their
past record the NEWS editorial writers apparently
feel that anyone revealing any distinctive variation
from their own phlegmatic stolidity has slipped
into the abyss of rank radicalism?”

In the first place, it is not our opinion that rad-
ical ideas are right or wrong. We simply feel and
wish to express once more that we do not think
that those people in TEACHERS COLLEGES can
avail themselves of as many radical ideas as the
average individual. A teacher would not be a real
teacher if he did not look into the various ways of
political thinking. Grant you that each person will
have his own opinion. However, as has been stated
and re-stated, there must be more caution exercised
by those in the teaching profession.

Complaints have also been heard that the edi~
torial column of the NEWS should not have been
used for the purpose of replying to the letter print-
ed last week. The letter was not a personal letter
to the editorial writer but to the NEWS Board as
a whole. It represented the reaction to the opinions
of a percentage of State College students as did
both the letters printed last week and this week.

This may seem like the old flag-raising technique
but there is an insignia which has been used on the
cover of the Alumni Quarterly and which will be
used next semester on all envelopes leaving the
Alumni Office which reads "Our teachers mold
our nation’s future.”

Do you believe in idealism? The
answar is probably yes, for'you, as
future teachers, are depending on
a certain proportion of idealism to
compensate for the new Packard

you won't be driving. A great many
Americans are idealistic. That has
been the dominant factor in the'

founding and eventual rise of this
nation among the other nations of
the world.

On November 2, the American
people will once again have the op-
portunity to decide the type of
idealism they want by the vote they
cast. However, that decision should
be rendered only after critical an-
alysis of the issues, the facts and
the arguments. Therefore as ideal-
ists and potential voters, it is well
worth the time to consider these
three factors before you reach your
decision.

THE ISSUES

The issues of this presidential
campaign are expressed not only in
the candidate but also in the plat-
form of the parties. The following
are the seven most important
planks of the democratic and re-
publican parties. They are foreign
policy, civil rights, inﬂation, labor,
social security, education and busi-
ness.

THE FACTS

The issues have been presented.
Now, what are the facts concerning
those issues?

Foreign policy: Dem.— Pledges
full support to the United Nations;
promises necessary funds and a
sound administration of the Mar-
shall plan; advocates adequate
armed forces to protect all coun-
tries' security.

Rep—Promises ﬁnancial aid
within prudent limits to help other
nations restore their economic in-
dependence.

Civil Rights: Dem—Calls on Con-
gress to support the President on
the civil rights issue. Pledges party,
through legislation to eradicate all
types of discrimination.

Rep—Favors enactment of legis-
lation ending all lynching and mob
violence; favors abolition of the poll
tax.

Inﬂation: Dem—Blames the Re-
publican-controlled Congress for
not adopting President’s compre-
hensive program of price control..

Rep—Asserts Truman adminis-
tration deliberately encouraged high
prices; pledges attack on basic
causes of inflation by cutting gov-
ernment spending.

Labor: Dem.~—Advocntes the re-
peal of Taft-Hartley act because it
has failed to bring industrial peace;
favors increasing minimum wage
from 40 cents to '75 cents per hour.

Rep—Pledges continued study to
improve labor-management rela-
tions in light of changing social
conditions.

Social Security: Dem—Favors in-
creasing old age and survivors in-
surance by 50%: reduction of elig-
ibility of women from 60 to 65
years.

Wat's ‘4” 1/0444 maxi

By ARTHUR FURNIA ______.—————

 

Rep-Urges extending old-age

survivors insurance program to a

more realistic leVeI.

Education: Dem—Supports fed—
eral appropriation of 300,000,000
dollars to start federal aid to edu-
cation. ’

Rep—Favors equality of educa-
tional opportunities for all.

Business: Dem—Pledges intens-
ive enforcement of antitrust laws
with adequate appropriations.

Rep—Declares small business
must be encouraged by correction
of tax abuses.

THE ARGUMENTS

The American people have been
too ready in the past to vote for a
candidate and ignore the platform
of the parties. Therefore before
consideration of any more of this
article return for an instant and
study the major planks of both
parties.

Observe the education plank, the
social security plank, the labor
plank, the civil rights plank and the
foreign policy plank of both parties.
Then answer these questions. Who
advocates a 300 million dollar fed-
eral support of education? Who
wishes to increase social security to
an adequate level? What party
dared to approach the disgraceful
civil rights issue? What party pro-
duced a necessary and aggressive
foreign policy? In short what party
has produced a platform of social
planning for the betterment of the
American people? If you are sin-
cere, there can be only one answer,
the Democratic party.

This debate must be equally pre-
sented, therefore consider the same
planks of the Republican party.
They appear to be worthy of little
consideration for they deal only in
vague generalities. The party is
making no promises because prom-
ises are based on plans and the Re-
publican party of 1948 has no plans,
at least none that its industrial
backers wish to show the Public.
The Republican party of 1948 has
the ability to present one face sav—
ing item, inc-too. However, you loy-
at followers of purple elephants will
cry that in the labor and business
planks, one ﬁnds some substantial
promises. Deﬁnitely these promises
are substantial to the moneyed in-
terests and dare you deny this with
the inflation caused by non-price
control and the attempted paralla-
ing of labor with the so-called e-
qualizing clauses of the Taft-Hart-
ley Labor Act? The record of the
80th Congress Is too recent to deny
or to be forgotten and the idealism
too sadly lacking to be praised.
YOUR DECISION

When you cast your ballot, re-
member that the candidate is only
part of the party. Remember the
platform is the basis upon which
that candidate will act. Remember
the ideals that America must fol-
low if we are to survive in this
world. Remember and vote for your
ideals.

To the Editor:

Every year in the NEWS some
student has had a good deal to say
about the manner in which the li—
brai'y rules are enforced. They seem
to resent what is, to them, a child-
ish "patrolling.'

The fact remains that in spite of
this vigilance, it is next to impos-
sible to work quietly and in peace
in our library

Studeuisv- especially freshmen——
simply do not. realize how madden-
ing the sound of a whispered con-
versation can be. Especially when,
across the table, seine poor bcdcv-
illed uppcrclassman, lingers in cars,
is trying to cram a little history
through a jaded briiin.

There are a hundred places on
campus to (:oi'Verse or study-by—
two’s. ’l‘hc pcristylcs, the COillll’ltlllH,
the Lounge, have no restriction
whatever. The tables in the cafe-
teria are always available, there are
benches in Draper hall, and under
the cimrs. The library is the one
place on campus where it is possible
to find relative peace and quiet for
working. If the students who want
to fraternizo would carry their con—

versations outside, so many stu-
dents wouid not have to go all the
way to the state library to work on
it term paper.

It is actually quiet there, and until
our students have n more adult at-
tii.udc, I will be the first to scream
for more and better monitors and
policemen to throw out. the gubbcrs.

Sincerely,
Betlevillcd Student
To the Editor:

How many instances of the. fol-
lowing comments have we heard u—
mong students? “Do you know
where the Form“ niccis?"or"Where
docs llol'ci' Club play this after-
noon?"

Such questions as these are. asked
cht‘ and over again and usually
otic must must search for the an—
su'ct‘s among the labyrinth oi' post-
ci's, nuouuccincuis, and clippings.

A solution could be ll wcck-
Iy bullc'iu listing in advance "iill"
the particular activities, what time
they commence, and Where they
meet. Many copies placed conspic-
uoust about the school Would end
this confused confusion.

WAR MEMORIAL

FOr a couple of years now there has been consider-
able agitation for a. State College War Memorial.
Committees have been appointed, only to end in a
deadlock because of lack of funds, incomplete re-
search, etc. Once again, a committee has been put
to work, and it's really anxious to get something
concrete going. It is considering the possibilities of
some suggestions and methods of ﬁnancing them at;
present, but to insure our having a memorial which
has the sentiment of the whole student; body behind
it. they must have your help. Next Friday in assembly
you will have the opportunity to make recommenda-
tions and to explain them. If you don't have an as-
sembly seat, drop a note to Shirley Wiltse '50, or my-
self. The committee is working for you; show it your
interest in a worthwhile State College project.
STRAIGHTEN UP

There’s a stick in the spokes somewhere. The Jun-
ior Student Council representative nominations
weren't posted until almost one week after those nom-
inations were ofﬁcially closed. For many legitimate
and otherwise reasons, a good many of the class mem-
bers could not attend the class meeting. They had no
way of knowing ofﬁcially the names of the nominees,
who had declined, or the time nominations were to
be closed. This was Myskania's own little secret. It’s
important that everybody have his full say in class
government; to do so he must be informed. Where
was the slip-up?

While we're at it—In the past. the rules have been
set up to allow for the closing of nominations at pre-
cisely the same time. Last week Myskania was run~
ning around frantically trying to get acceptances of
a couple of last-minute nominations. In all fairness
to the nominees, it was necessary to break the rules.
Why not be sensible? Let's change the regulations
concerned to allow an extra day for declinations.
VOTE WISELY

That was a good, clear explanation of the use of
the preferential ballot that we saw in assembly last.
week. It's too had some of the "clever kids" had to
try to make a farce out of' the system by turning in
“that's me's" and Mickey Mouse write-in’s.

I Today. We vote for a .lt‘W vice-president. It's an
important job, requiring a hard working, conscien-
tious person to ﬁll it. Think carefully, and vote only as
far as you're sure of yourself.

PROGRESS

Well, the administration is really started now in
its efforts to improve student facilities. Those hand—
some looking mail boxes strung out in a line are a big
step toward breaking up the congestion that had made
such a ﬁre-trap of the Commons. Let's not make this
progress useless by blocking the entrance, using the
space to stop for our between-classes chatter.
THE RIGHT LIST

Seems as though lots of students prayed to Minerva
last semester. Check the Dean's List in today's NEWS;
it‘s longer by for than the one released a year ago.
This stiould be very gratifying news to Miss Stokes
who last wcck expressed her concern over students'
apparent disdain for scholarship. We are showing that
we do know the real reason i'or our being here, and
that we are striving for a good balance between our
scheduled and extra-curricular education.

a powerful tragedy. Having :ccii the previews in class,

Nylons and high heels, or the blue
pin-stripe suit will deﬁnitely be out
of place in Page Hall next Friday
night, for Commuters Club is pre-
senting its annual Soc-Hop. Books,

inate at the affair as the Commuté

Immediately after paying the
small but necessary price of 50
cents for admission, the public will
run into the shoe checking booth,
which is under the direction of Hel-
ene Patten ’52. From here they will
proceed directly to the gym floor
where round and square dancing
will be in progress.

If time can be taken from danc-
ing to admire the decorations, we
would find that Marlon Oliver '50
and her committee have given the
gym the appearance of an old-style

barn with pumpkins and cornstaiks
liberally and literally scattered a-
round.

Not to be outdone in maintaining
the Halloween atmosphere, the re-
freshment committee under' the
leadership of Lois Cruden ’51 has
provided free older (a keg no less)
and donuts for all.

During the course of the dancing,
a brief break will be taken and
special entertainment will be pro-
vided. Included among the special
features, arranged by Joyce Plat-
ner and Helen Marie Moeller, Soph-
omores, will be songs by a male
quartet, monologues by Delphine
Verch and Jackie Mann, Sopho-
mores, ond a tap dance by Miss
Moeller. Master of Ceremonies for
the evening’s program will be Mit-
chell Burkowsky '52.

The dance is open to all students,
so put the day, October 29, down
in your little black book, find a
date, and come down to Page Hall
gym.
