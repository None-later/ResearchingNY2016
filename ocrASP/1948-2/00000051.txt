To the Editor:

'I'ihe NEWS‘editorial writers have
once again succeeded in shocking
the intelligence of its readers by its
unfair and irresponsible attacks on
the political opinions and activities
of: members of the studentbody.

First, however, I would like to
point out an inaccuracy made inthe
editorial of two weeks ago. “Those
sheets of yellow matter" referred to,
did not publicize the reception held
for Norman Thomas at Channing
Hall. The circulars announced that
Samuel Friedman, a spokesman for
the Socialist Party, would speak at
the Forum of Politics, our campus'
non-partisan political discussion
group.

Last spring, Forum of Politics an-
nounced its program to present a
spokesman from each political par-
ty to represent their respective
points of view. By the time this is
printed both the Democrats and
the Republicans will have had equal
opportunity to present their views.
It was also decided that each meet-
ing would be turned Over to that
group in the student body support-
ing the political party represented
whether they be Young Republicans,
Youth For Thomas, Young Demo-
crats, or what-have-you.

Accordingly, when Mr. Friedman
of the Socialist Party was expected
to speak, the Youth For Thomas
group on campus assumed responsi-
bility for Mr. Friedman's meeting.
In order to sufficiently publicize the
event, Youth For Thomas placed
personally addressed circulars in
the mailboxes announcing the
meeting and its sponsorship.

Now according to the affronted
editorial writers of the NEWS. this
is an “obvious example of the demn
onstrations which are disturbing to
the public." In all fairness, we must
expect the NEWS to make similar
editorial accusations against New-
man Club, SCA, Hillel, IZFA, IVCF.
Commuters‘ Club, French Club and
all other organizations on campus
who have been guilty of similar
forms of public “demonstrations.”

From what divine source the ad.-
torial writers of the NEWS assume
their guardianship of the political
morality of the student body is
quite puzzling. Nevertheless, they
have taken it upon themselves, with
immodest self-righteousness, to
“focus” editorial denunciation on
“those people ‘tinged' with radical
views who blindly ‘dive head-first'
for something new." From their
past record the NEWS editorial
writers apparently feel that anyone
revealing any distinctive variation
from their own phlegmatic stolidity
has slipped into the abyss of rank
radicalism.

If the above quote refers to the
Socialist Party platform, as a sup-
porter of its program, i must pro-
test. The Socialist Party has never
felt that their program was "tinged
with radicalism." The Socialist pro-
gram is a radical program and
avowedly so. If the NEWS editorial
writers feel that there is any perni-
cious congenital evil in a radical
position, then let them say so, and
debate the question freely and

openly. The editors reveal their own
political adolescence by such unde-
fined skittish reference.

But, as the editorial develops. we
see that the above quoted comments
are merely rationalizations of a
more "realistic" argument. We come
to the meat of the matter which
consists of fore-warnings on outside
influences. With blatant cynicism
we are told to “watch our step. We
do not have a complete freedom of
speech.” In order to be "successful,"
We are advised, We should not feel
free to speak out on “each and
every" issue!

Indeed! What are we teaching
for anyway? This not-so-gentle
hint to curb any attempt toward
advanced social thought is quite
disturbing. This is the counsel of-
fered to teachers in whose respon-
sibility lies the sustenance of our
democratic way of life.

A lot of people, it seems, read
our paper: more than “many .peo-
ple imagine!” “Teachers are sub-
ject to criticism." (Albany is es-
pecially guilty of this dubious ten-
dency.) “We are laying ourselves
wide open for criticism.” My, my,
of all things, criticism in a democ-
racyi What will we come to next?

When are we going to grow up?
Certainly we are subject to critic-
ism. For What reason should We be
above it? Right here at State Col-
lege there is a deserving need for
criticism. Where are the basic phil-
osophy courses necessary for a well-
rounded intellectual outlook? Where
are the psychological laboratories
necessary to a teacher-training
curriculum?

It is just this sort of servility and
social timidity which has gained
the teacher profession its low rating
in the public eye. When are we go-
ing to assume the responsibilities
both as citizens and as teachers
necessary for professional respect?
Observe the lawyers in their bar
associations, the doctors in the
AMA. You will find no timidity
there. ‘

The fore-warnings continue to be
brought closer to home. All veils
are shorn; the final threat is un-
sheathed: "Our bread and butter lie
down the street only four blocks
away."

Last year, an outside source made
the invalidated charge that “cross
materialism" was being taught. in
the curriculum. We who have ex-
perienced the curriculum here know
that this is untrue. But the atti-
tudes noted above certainly confirm
its presence on campus.

If the NEWS editorial writers
must engage in partisan attacks,
would they please offer some alter-
native with ideological substance
rather than the puritannical de-
pravity presently exhibited.

As for “flying off the handle,"
the editors have already displayed
a distressiul need for their own ad-
vice.

Very truly yours.

The Varsity Bowlers continue to
click as they swept three games
from Albany Business College Wed-
nesday night at the Playdium. By
smothering the ABC. five, the
State keglers assured themselves of
a first place tie with Siena. Each

PICSS Leaders

With the Intramural football sea-
son half-way over Potter and St.
Mary‘s Angels lead the “A” League
while Van Derzee leads the “B”
League. KB and the Finks won in
their last. outings to tighten up the
race for the league’s leadership.

Rain and mud made Wednesday‘s
games close and slow-moving. The
opening kick-off accounted for the
ﬁrst score, in the ‘VanDerzee-SLS
game, as Moriarity grabbed the ball
near his own goal line and when he
tried to evade the charging line of
SLS he stepped into his own end
zone where he was tagged for a
safety. VunDerzee pushed over a
second period score on a short pass,
Wiley to Moriarity, to go ahead of
SLS: 6-2.

KB Takes to the Air

After the VanDerzce touchdown
the game was almost a standstill
due to the slippery field and wet
ball. Willlf' VanDcrzec and SLS
were battling in their close game
KB edged out the Ham and Eggers:
14-13. With Sy Fcrsh in the back-

field KB took to the air time and ,

time again and scored its touch-
downs on passes to Milk and Wax-
man. The extra points were added
on passes to Berger and Milk. The
Ham and Eggcrs struck back with
touchdowns by Ludluin and Dun-
rombc. O'Brien made the first extra
point, but the lilggcrs failed to con-
vert after their second TD and
that decided the outcome of the
gilllll‘.

Last Tuesday the fur started ﬂy-
ing. "I'll then differences of opinion
had only reached the argument
stage.

It’s easy to flare up in football
and hard to cool off. But to any-
one who stops and watches the
games. the ﬁghts leave a bad opin-
ion of State College. More import-
ant is thc fact that recreation is
the primary aim of Intramural Ath-
letics. Next year, restrictions a-
gainst ﬁghting should be added to
the rules.

When the lights start, the rec-
reation is gone. When the recrea—
tion is gone it's time to quit.

Tennis, Golf Rained Out

Tennis and golf have run against
bad weather. No matches have been
played this week. With the cold
weather coming, it looks as if the
tournaments won’t be ﬁnished.

All-American Team

Our weekly ballot for “Collier's

changes this week. Here's the team:
C Yeoman Army
Mnrusic Missouri

uin people around State who feel
that we need Varsity athletics dur-

the absence of a Varsity football

Pat Jo! and Phyllis Harris, co
chairmen, have announced that one
hundred girls will attend the event.
A bonfire will be built and outdoor

za where they will board a Sling-
erlands bus to the Slingeriands
Garage. The three hay wagons are
scheduled to leave from that point
at 8:15 pm.

Audry Weller, chairman of the re-
freshment committee, has assured
that there will be food for all at-
tending. The party will end at elev-
en to give freshmen time to return
to their dorms before 12 pm.

A charge of ten cents is to be col-
lected to help pay for the costs of
the hayride.

Potter Downs Scrubs
in Soccer Opener, 4-2

Competition in Intramural Soc-
cer resumed this fall with Potter
defeating a stubborn Scrub team
4-2. The game was hotly contest-
ed from the opening whistle to the
filial play.

Jim Warden started the fireworks
by scoring a goal early in the peri-
od. Throughout the rest of the first
period both teams displayed brilli-
ant defensive play.

Midway in the sccc..u period, E
E P's offensive clicked again as
Jim Jiusto scored a goal from a
few yards out. Again the Scrubs
fought uphill and also scored at
close of the second period. Jim Mar-
siglio was awarded a penalty kick,
which turned into a Well-executed
play with Nolan Powell doing the
scoring.

Second Half Tight

The final two periods saw both
teams display a tight defense with
the Scrubs dominating play in the
third period.

Events “ Scheduled
For Campus Day

Plans for field events to be held
on Campus Day were completed on
Monday by the Rivalry Committee.
Races for both men and women
will be conducted.

In the men's categorie, football
passing for distance, a tug of war,
a relay, and high jumping will be
featured. Pat Dooley will take
charge of Sophomore entries while
Robinson, Peene, Wiley, and San-
derson will lead the freshmen team.

Esse Juengiing has been appoin-
ted to supervise the freshman team
in the women's events. A three-
legged race, an old clothes race,
fifty yard dash, tug of war and a
three man relay will be included in
the women's division.

The field events will be held at
ten o’clock on the morning of Cam-
pus Day. Twa points will be award-
ed for the victorious men’s team
and two for the women. If any
one class takes both events, the
campus cup is assured them.

Practices by both classes will be
conducted throughout the coming
week. '

Tumbling Team Plans
For Future Exhibits

The Tumbling Club, which meets
Thursday nights at Page Hall Gym,
welcomed a large group of fresh-
man men and women this week
Quite a bit of new talent presented
itself. A varsity squad was picked
and they will work out Saturday
afternoons on new routines in ad-
dition to regular session work.

The trampoline is the big attrac-
tion, and is of great interest to the
new members, who are anxious to
try it out. This will be the main
apparatus in any exhibition put on
by the Club.

The possibility of an Assembly
and a few outside exhibitions is
good this year. according to Coach
