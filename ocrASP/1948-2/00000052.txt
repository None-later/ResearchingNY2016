Voters Maintain

College Precedent

Socialists Piece Third,
Evidence New Strength
Among Campus Parties

Governor Thomas E. Dewey. for
the second time m a State College
NEWS straw vore, was given pref-
erence in the Presidential Poll.
Lmvernor Dewey's margin of vic-
tory over his chief opponent. Presi-
dent Harry S. Truman, was in a ra-
no of almost 3:2 of the total vote,
wnich included 816 students. or
62.7% 01 the Student Body. 21.9%
of whom are eligible voters. This
Iigure is more than double the 10.3%
wno Were qualified to vote in 1944.

Unlike the 1944 race, however.
this election was not close to the
ponit of being decided by only a
low votes. The actual figures were:
Dewey, 396; Thomas, 71; Truman.
2'19; Wallace, 62; and Thurinond,
(by Wl‘lbt-lnl. 2. These figures in-
dicate Lhat 48.5% of the student
body or 45.2% of the voters me in
layer of Dewey. while 34.2% of the
former group or 33.5% of the voters
are hopeful for Truman.
Republican Traditionally

The vote this year is in keeping"
with the tradition that State College
is Republican in its politics. Signi-
ficant, however, is the fact that Mr.
Norman Thomas this year polled
8.7% of the total vote, or 13.4%
01 those of the qualified voters. In
1944 Mr. Thomas could garner only
3 votes out of the 793 which were
cast.

Only once in the twenty-four
years that the poll has been con-
ducted at State has a. Democratic
candidate for President been chos-
cn by the Student Body. This was
in 1936 when the Association chose
the late Franklin D. Roosevelt by
a very narrow margin, but he went
on to win at the national polls by
an unpreccd‘entedly large majority.
The Republicans returned to favor
in Students Polls, however, in 1940
and 1944 by narrow majorities each
time.

It is evident that straw polls at
State have very little bearing on
the national elections. however. and
by all indications this year a Tru-
man victory would be predicted.
since polls in previous years have
acted almost invariably as nega-
lch indicators.
