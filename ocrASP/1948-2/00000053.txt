NOTIING FOR NUI'IIING

We're getting gypped, friends. mo years ago, con-

tracts were signed for. supplying .of class rings up
through the class of 1953. The idea behind signing so

.far ahead of time was to insure (i) that the Gleason

Com would keep selling State College rings, and
(2) th’ﬁystudents would be protected against soaring
prices. At that time, we Werepromised that there
would be no change in the quality of the jewelry. Now,
dozens of our Seniors are coming to the sudden reali-
zation that the rings aren't so good after all—stones
scratch, chip and loosen very easily. Apparently, we
aren't getting as good service as in pre-long-term-
contract da 5.

Before lollg, Gieason's representatives will be here,
foisting on the Class of ’50 the same junk jewelry
they sold to the ’49’ers. They should be forewarned
that the quality of the goods will have to improve be-
fore w'e’ll sign any more contracts, and that now is the
time they'll have to show us they can do better. We’ve
received many favorable offers from other companies,
and we won't hesitate to change over if they don't
do right by '50. In the meantime, you dissatisﬁed
Seniors ought to go down to Broadway and raise Cain
with Gleason and Co. Maybe they’ll make amends.
WAR MEMORIAL

Don't forget—be ready to make some suggestions
in assembly today for the War Memorial. It won’t
be a State College War Memorial without everybody's
backing.

GEEV A YALL:

Our bowling team is hot again this year; they’re
at the top of the local college bowling league. This
is the one sport in which State can compete favorably
with the more sports-minded colleges, such as Siena
and RPI. Yet, they’ve been playing to “crowds” of
a half dozen rooters.

The boys roll at the Piaydium every Wednesday
night at 9 o'clock. Let’s go over there and cheer for
them. At least they'll know we appreciate their ef-
forts and are really backing them.
BRUSH-SWINGING DAY

The Chapel at the Albany Home for Children is
sorely in need of a new paint job. Smiles and Mys-
kania are out to do something about it, so they've
proclaimed November eleventh Brush-Swinging Day.
They’ve got to have muscle available. though, and
that’s where you State fellows come in. Reserve that
day for the kids.

Drop a. note in the Myskania mailbox, telling them
you'll be available, so they can figure on just how
many brushes and paint pails they'll need. It’s anoth-
er chance for you to lend a hand where it’s really
appreciated.

NEWS FROM THE OUTSIDE

In acknowledgement of your interest in other col-
leges, the NEWS is setting up an exchange library in
the P0,, next week. In it, there will be represented
th newspapers of some one hundred colleges. All stu-
dents are welcome to drop in any time to browse
through these journals. If, by chance. the one you
want isn't there, contact Rosemary Stoddard, News
Exchange Editor, and she'll see to it that we get it.
LA-LA-LA

Monday is November ﬁrst, the day on which all
freshmen are required to be able to sing “Arm in
Am," "College of the Empire State," and the “Fight
Song." Be sure to know i'hem, little brothers and
sisters, 'cause those big, bad Sophomores will get you
if you don't watch out!

SOMETHING TO THINK ABOUT

Here’s a little poem I came across in a magazine
the other day. It made me think, and it‘s sure to do
the same for anyone who hopes some day to guide
young people.

LAST WORDS OF A COLLEGE PRESIDENT
by Charles Angoff

I walked and sat erect for thirty years,

A proud merchant of correct ideas,

Cold gladness and unsullied decorum.

I fashioned cautious men without souls

And brittle women with measured passions.

Behold a traitor

To his Creator.

More Power

Press Bureau has redeemed itself in the eyes of
Student Association. This statement reflects the
opinion of large numbers of the student body who
feel that once again our press organization is on

its feet.

Last year the Bureau suffered during the entire
year as a result of an, unfortunate occurence con-
cerning the conducting of the “Who’s Who” elec-
tion. Their attack was even carried to the local pa-
pers and whatever attempts were made by this or-
ganization to regain its prestige seemed futile.

To some students the organization is just a name.
However, the Bureau handles many more jobs than
the majority realize. It handles all publlc1ty for
Student Association and Student Council in addi-
tion to outside publicity for various organizations
such as IGC, SMILES, D81A, and Music Council.
Graduation notices together with pictures of the
graduates and job notices are mailed to the home-
town papers. Notices are sent each tlmc that any
person’s name appears in the NEWS for wmlllllg
an election or being head of a committee or school
function.

In addition to these duties, Press Bureau coll-
ducts a tour of the campus for freshmen when they
come to the college for their personal interviews
during second semester.

Since the appointment of the Coordinator of
Field Services and Public Relations last year, Press
Bureau, the Coordinator and the NEWS have been
working together for the purpose of getting as
much local publicity as possible for the college.
Each Thursday afternoon a representative from
the Knickerbocker News meets with ll representa-
tive from Press Bureau to get all news for the week.

For the moment, let us be a little more positive
and realize what has been done so far this year. A
Public Relations booklet for the purpose of re-
cruiimellt is being edited by the members of Press
Bureau; notices have been sent to the hometown
papers of all those people who were named to flu-
Dean’s list for second semester; Press Bureau’s
bulletin board has been fairly loaded with Clippings
from the local papers—this, in itself, proves that
our publicity is steadily increasing.

Attempts are being made by the Bureau in So-
cure a full-page spread on Campus Day ill the
Times Union Sunday. liven if this publicity czlllnol
Iii' arranged, at least the attempt is being, made.

Other State teacher colleges are way behind us
us far as public relations and press bureaus are con-
ccrncd. As 21 result. of [he Press Conference at New
I’llltz last weekend, it was learned that only Pots-
(lzlm lllld Albany have working Press Bureaus. ()ill—
era are ill the process of being organized lit the
present time.

Our Press Bureau is on the ltlcrtw—illrougll their
efforts Sillic College is beginning to be recognized
a: it should l)C—v-(i()llgi'flllilillIlmS for ll your well-
sillricd are ill order.
