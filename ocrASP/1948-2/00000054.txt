Credit? is due Marty Bush for 

direction of a play we all know
well, and one for which it is ver-

effective lighting were the only aids
to Richard Gutta and his leading

shoulders and came through with

Ham 8: Eggers Nip VDZ I

Tight Races Loom
ln Both Leagues

Due to the upset victory by St.
Mary’s over SLS and the Ham and
Eggers’ win over VDZ, the “B”
League race has grown tighter be-
tween VDZ, KB, and the Ham and
Eggers, while Potter took over the
"A" League leadership by beating
the Angels. 19-0, last Thursday.

SLS opened their game against
St. Mary's by kicking off and forc-
ing St. Mary's to kick on their own
five. The kick was blocked and as
the ball scooted into the end zone
Lamanna fell on the ball for a
safety and two points for SLS. (The
same score they led VDZ by last
week before they lost 6-2). After
both teams fumbled and SLS got
off a poor punt, St. Mary’s got pos-
sessmn on SLS’s seven. A quick
pass, Lamanna to Burt, clicked for
a touchdown but the try for the
extra point failed.

SLS Threatens

SLS camc charging back but a
brilliant goal line stand stopped
them only a few feet from the goal.
An intercepted pass by Dombrow-
ski again put SLS deep in St.
Mary's territory, but again they
failed to score. The second half
saw a sec—saw battle with many in-
terceptions by both teams. The
galllc ended with St. Mary's in pos-
session of tlic ball as they ran out
the clock in thc closing plays.

The lium and Eggors tripped
VDZ 6-0 to drop them from the
unbeaten ranks. The Eggcrs scored
midway in the first period when
O'Brien passed to George for six
points, the extra point atocmpt
failed. A blocked kick by Ludlum on
VDZ’s it“ not up the score. VDZ.
tried to tie up the game by throw-
ing short passes to Stevenson and
Morlm'lly, however, a Light dcfcnso

With Georgi-“s running and the
blocking of his forward wail, VDZ
had a tough time in stopping the

their territory. (.icol'gc's perfectly

Large Turnout
For Cage Squad

Students at SCT can look for-
ward this year to a short but full-
of-fight cage team. Coach Hathaway
has the crying towel out over the
loss of some of last year’s key men
but hopes that the new aggrega-
tion can measure up to last year's
squad when it hit its peak at the
end of last season.

Important cogs in this year’s
team seem to be returning players,
especially Captain Kenny George,
Tom O’Brien, Seymour “Sy” Fersh,
last year high scorer, “Link” Mar-
zello and Marv Lansky. Two new
men, Jim Warden and Dave Weath-
erby, up from last season’s reserves,
will be counted on heavily in this
year's plans.

The schedule, as printed below,
lists 21 games. of which ten
are at home. A full month rc-
malns before the team will swing
into action.

Free Admission to Students

Students will not have to buy
tickets to see the games. They will
be admitted when they show their
student activities cards at the door.
No urrmigcmcnts have been made
for students traveling to away
games with official sanction of the
school. (But why not, it's a good
idcu?!!?l Those who want to go
out of town to see the games must
provide their own transportation.

The squad has been working out
for the past two Weeks, and for
those who think basketball practice
is just a “snap affair," come on
down to the gym and sweat out a
couple of practice sessions with the
hard working “Pods.” A fast, split-
sccoud game like basketball rc-
quircs hours of constant drill, and
Coach Hathaway has been working
the team strenuously in an effort
lo turn out a winning combination.
The squad is still large, and an un-
lucky l'cw will lch to be cut to
briug the [cum to the limit of 14
Vmslty and 12 J.V. men.

IPetter Club’s vauntdd; 
again soared into high gear as they
drubbed the Angels, 16-0. In every
instance it seemed that Potter men
were in the right ,place, at the right
time. The game started slowly and
both teams thre'atenéd throughout
the first period. Toward the end of
the first session Potter registered
its first goal with Jim Warden mak-
ing the marker.

Potter Runs Wild ‘

In the second and third period
Potter ran wild, scoring freely with
Jim Jiusto, Joe Biviano, Austin
Monroe, Mel Lansky each adding
one goal and Gene McLaren
pushing through two. In the last
session the game slowed up consid-
erany but Potter managed to score
another goal through the eﬁorts of
Gene McLaren.

This Saturday is Campus Day, so
the games that are scheduled for
that date will be played Friday.

Sayles Hall Amazons
Club Pierce Hall Rivals

Pierce Hail bowed down before
the overwhelming forces of the
Saylcs Hull Amazons. Challenged by
Pierce, Sayles rallied their number
for the game Saturday at l p. m.
The result—a 2-0 score for Saylcs.
The star player of the afternoon
was goalie Evans. Usually goalies
guard with their feet or sticks. Not
Evans. She llcs across the goal! But
even that couldn't stop the gals
from Suylcs. Marie 'l‘liurlow and
Betty Hicks each slammed a goal.
The girls from Pierce tried hard,
but even tluir high swinging center
and their powerful ccntcr half
couldn‘t keep back the Saylcs derC.
Cl‘lCCi‘lOlldCl's from both dorms were
out to spirit the girls on to victory.
Evou Mrs. Mac guvc encouragement
from her window. With all this
backing the SllleS gals couldn‘t

Taking advantage of Plharmacy's
’vl'ctory‘oyer Siena, .the State keg-
lers rolled into first place in the
Intercollegiate bowling league Weds,
ncsday night. While the statesmen.
were mauling the cellar-dwelling
lawyers from . Law school three
times, the phannaciets turned the
tables on the Siena squad by taking
two out of three games. Before the
match, the Varsity five and Siena
shared first place, but Wednesday’s
victory gave the State quintet a
two game lead.

Tumbling the lumber at a 552
clip, Don McDonald copped the in-,
dividual high three honors for the
evening. Diz Dickinson rolled 202
for the weekly high in the singles
department.

Besides taking over first place
the statesmen also dominate the
league in several other departments:
including team high three game to-
tal and team high single game to-
tal for the season. Fran Mullin’s
seasonal average is tops in that
division as well as his 625 three
game effort and his 2’31 high single.

Next week State will meet the
Pharmacy five.
