Five College Poll
Shows Confrary
Election Results

Reviewing the straw polls taken
in four colleges other than State—
namely, the University of Rochester,
Skidmore. Geneseo State Teachers'
College, and the University of Geor-
gia—it was found that, like the
State poll, and unlike the final
election outcome, Dewey was most
favored in these schools.

That the straw polls taken in the
five colleges (including State Col-
lege poll) were contrary to the re-
sults of the national presidential
elections field last Tuesday, is con~
clusively proven in the accounts of
the polls taken in the colleges in
their respective school publications.

According to national tallies, in
the national polls. 49 per cent of
the popular vote went to the Demo-
cratic candidate. President Harry S.
Truman, and 46 per cent of that
popular vote was given to the Re-
publican candidate for office. Gov—
ernor Thomas E. Dewey.

This differs from the college straw
vote wherein Dewey was given the
majority vote in all five colleges.
For example:

01‘ the 477 ballots cast in the Uni-
versity of Rochester, Dewey took 49
per cent, and Truman 35.6 per cent.
Skidinore straw voters gave Dewey
78 per cent of 605 votes, and Tru-
man 14 per cent. At Geneseo State
Teachers’ College. Dewey got 47
per cent of 335 straw votes cast,
and the President 16 per cent. The
University of Georgia gave the
Governor of New York State 34.5
per cent of 1127 votes and Truman
31 per cent.

Broadway Players
To Bring Hamlet,

Macbeth To State
Schedule Afternoon,

Evening Performances
In Auditorium Today

D&A Council will present today
two of Shakespeare's plays, “Ham-
let” and “Macbeth,” performed by
the Margaret Webster theatrical
troupe. “Macbeth” is to be given
this afternoon and will commence
at 2:45 p. m. “Hamlet” will begin at
8:30 p. in. this evening.

For many years, Miss Webster
states, she has dreamed of bringing
the works of great dramatists to
people who do not ordinarily have
a chance to see the legitimate the-
atre. If the tour is successful, she
believes it may open a new field of
employment. implement the acad-
emic course of study by tying it in
with the regular curricula and,
most important, stimulate local ac-
tivity, which, Miss Webster believes.
is one of the ways to decentralize
the American theatre. Sending out
inquiries to more than 500 colleges,
she found out what Shakespearean
pieces were most in demand. Around
these results she based her pro-
cedures. Auditioning more than 300
actors, particularly younger ones
from the American Theatre Wing
and the American Repertory The-
atre, she selected Carol Goodner to
play the Lady Macbeth role; Al-
fred Ryder, who appears as Hamlet;
and Joseph Holland and 24 other
players.

Feature Projected Scenery

The sets. designed by Wolfgang
Roth to serve both productions,
illustrates the theory that scenery
should not be a built background
but an active part of each produc-
tion. The audience's imagination is
relied upon a great deal because Mr.
Roth believes that the major ac—
cent is on the actor and on the
work itself. The sets are compact
and may be set up in an hour, but
they are unique in the last that an
automatic slide changer from the
switch-board projects the mood and
atmosphere of the scenes on a
screen serving as a backdrop. The
shadows of the three witches, for
instance. will look like trees on the
screen.

Miss Webster has cut out lines
with care, leaving “Macbeth” sub-
