For Off-Campus

By EVELYN WOLFE

Milne ran a poor second as a
practice teacher's playground when
compared to the schools of the oil’-
campus program, according to a re-
cent NEWS poll. Of the fifteen
practice teachers contacted, four-
teen preferred the training of sur-
rounding schools, while the lone
Milnite suggested that both types
of training would be helpful. “You
get to know the students better
through daily contact, than by the
single period system of Milne”, was
the sentiment of several. Several
mentioned that they feel like gen-
uine teachers rather than the part-
time students of Milne.

Almost half of the students were
amazed that expenses are actually
lower when off-campus than on.
That means that by buying meals
through the government subsidized
cafeterias, money saved on meals
more than makes up for the trans-
portation fares to the schools. Sev-
eral students have not been fortun-
ate in drawing one of these schools.
but though the fare is moderately
expensive, the extra experience
gained is well worth it, according
to these practice teachers.

At the present time. only those
who are English or History majors
are included in the off-campus pro-
gram. When the questioned teach-
e.s are in charge of teaching pro-
grams, they intend to send teachers
from all departments to brave the
classrooms of Schenectady and
Coxsackie. “Why should English
and Social Studies majors get all
the breaks?” seemed to be the
query.

Eight Weeks is too short a time
to become int. grated into the school

and communit, according to the
poll. Most of he practice teachers
were made to feel that they be-
longed to the faculty, and through
PTA. groups, they have become
familiar with the students and their
home life. Learning students’ names
and observing various types of pu-
pils makes life more fascinating, ac-
cording to one masculine member
of the poll. Most reported that the
eight Weeks have passed too soon
and that they will miss their re-
spective schools.

General problems ran mostly to
overcrowding of rooms, difﬁculty in
making bus connections and lack of
contact with college activities.
When two activities coincide at the
high school and State, often the
one at the high must be attended
in preference.

Since the favorable reactions have
been so unanimous among the pres-
ent group of Seniors. perhaps the
roads to Ravens and East Green-
bush will lure away more students
than the well-beaten hall through
Page in the next few years. Who
knows?

Conlesl Entries

Robert Kittredgc ’49, has an-
nounced that a, contest is being
conducted to choose a seal for the

contest is open to all students of
the various State Teachers' Col—
legcs.

The art classes are working on
seals to be submitted, and any one
else who is interested in entering
the contest should plan to have his
drawing ready to hand to Kitt—
redgc by November 15. All entries
will be taken to Brockport for the

In Campus Drive

For Student Aid

Campaign Will Open
Friday, WSSF Slated
To Receive Collections

“Contributions to the Campus
Chest Drive which opens here on
November 12, will directly beneﬁt
university students and teachers in
war devastated nations all over the
world,” declared Ruth Smith ’50,
Drive Chairman at State College.

The World Student Service Fund
receives the majority of the funds
collected during the Campus Chest
Drive. This is the only national or-
ganization pledged to give aid to
university people in all parts of the
world, regardleSS of race, color, or
creed, and it is working today in
Europe, China, and Southeast Asia.
The WSSF is the American repre-
sentative of World Student Relief,
and all of the “relatively prosper-
ous" nations of the world have sim-
ilar national committees to raise
funds for student relief.

England and the Scandinavian
countries subscribe more money per
student for relief than the United
States. China also raises a given
sum for aid to European students as
a token of student solidarity around
the world.

Students abroad have inaugurat-
cd and are carrying on ingenious
and comprehensive self-help pro-
grams. Mimeograph cooperatives in
universities throughout Europe and
Asia are reproducing the textbooks
destroyed in the war. and student
laundries, shoe repair shops, rest—
aurants. banks, have been created
by the students themselves.

The World Student Service Fund
constitutes the only American
source of help to university groups
abroad.

Wad-allot:

By PAT J AI

Jean Hotaling ’50. and Babe Pat-
erson ’51, are doing an excellent job
as hockey captains, but they can’t
do much with only a few girls out
for practice. The weather has made
many practices pessible, :but a rela—
tively small group of girls have
gone often enough to get ten hours
credit. Why not make these last
few practices really good? And
please return the hockey sticks and
balls that have been borrowad.
Rivalry for Whole College

Let’s have a few more upperclass—
men out to see the rivalry events.
As soon as the Sophomore year is
over, the students seem to think
that they no longer have to bother
with it. Rivalry is an expression of
the college pep, and it’s not up to
the Sophomores and fresh-men alone
to exhibit this spirit.

Why Foot the Bill?

WAA has been asked to pay for
a part of the ping-pong balls used
in the Commons. When don‘t the
girls ever get a chance to use the
table? A few minutes before the
bell, maybe. when the feIIOWS have
finished. Can WAA be expected to
pay for something they have no op-
portunity to use?

Contact Your Manager

Representatives and managers to
WAA council are elected by the dif-
ferent classes. Their duty is to pre-
sent the ideas of the class at the
council meetings. For any informa-
tion or suggestions about WAA con-
tact your class representatives!

Sayles is still waiting for the
Pierce girls to take up their volley-
ball challenge.

Confusing Committee

Not only is the Rivalry commit-
tee itself mixcd up but now the
student body is confused as to who
won the rivalry football game, 01'
is it still to be played? No one
seems to know when the event is.
Maybe the class presidents lRlVilll'y
Committee) are too busy to let us
know. If a girl was appointed to
represent WAA at the meetings,
maybe this committee would find
it easier to schedule the girls'
games. It would be even better if
the rivalry events were lined up for
the rest of the year so both the
Sophs and fresh may have a
chance to practice.

A point of information? Who has
arranged for a referee for the Riv-
ulry Hockey game?

Potter Crushes Ramblers;

KB Wallops Van Der Zee

Take A813 Loop
TitlesRespectively

KB clinched the “B” League title
Wednesday. by downing VDZ: 26-6.
Potter finished a perfect season by
trouncinu the Ramblers, 38-0.

In the VDZ-KB game, KB scored
early in the first period, when
Fcrsh intercepted a VDZ aerial at
midfield. On the next series of
downs Berger hit Gornbein for the
first score of the game. The try for
the extra point was good, and KB
led 7-0.

Lone VDZ Score

Van Derzee came roaring back in
the second period with Moriarity
slicing off two large gains on the
ground. A Wiley to Moriarity pass
set the ball on the KB goal line. On
the next play Lisker intercepted a
pass which stopped Van Derzce‘s at-
tack momentarily, then Hausner
played turnabout by scooping one
of Fersh's passes out of the air and
again placing the ball on the KB
goal line. Wiley then passed to M0-
rinrity in the end zone for a TD.
Tho try for the extra point was
blocked, KB still out in front: 7—6.
KB lengthened their lead late in the
second period when Waxman
caught one of F'crsh's passes in the
end zone.

As the second half opened, KB
through the eﬂ‘orts of Fersh started
a march downfield. Fcrsh passed to
Waxman for a long gain and then
hit Gornbein in the end zone for
another TD. This time the extra
point try was good and KB led 20-
6. KB scored again midway in the
third period on a pass interception
by Lisker only to have it nullified
by a penalty for the illegal 1151: of
the hands. Their penalty did not
thwart the scoring efforts of KB
and they continued to clle and
scored one more TD before the
final gun. F’ersh threw a long pass
to Liskrr who carried the ball into
the end zone making the filial
score: 26-6.

Potter Unscorcd Upon

Going through another season
undefeated and untied upon, {Pot—
Lcr also chalked up another record.
This year they were unscorcd upon.

Against the Ramblers, after Pot—
ter took the opening kickoff on
their own 30, Lansky went around
cm! for a touchdown jaunt that

'- gave Marv his first of two scores.

Potter kicked——hcld the Ramblers—~—
threw a pass—led 12-0. This time
the score was on n 50 yard Warden
to Carter pass. Warden caught
Carter pass for the extra point.
Eli‘l’ crossed the Ramblers“ goal line
twice more in the first half. Once
on :1 short run by Warden climax-
11g :1 dowuficld drive and the other
time on a long pass to Amyot.
Scorcless 3rd Quarter

In the 3rd quarter the Ramblers
held Potter scoreless. although Pot—
tcl‘ had possession of the ball for
most of the period. In the final
quarter Poltcr's offense opened up
nunin aflcr Wurch intercepted a
pass of midfield. After a series of
plays Lunsky scoofcd 10 yards for

place Stole quintet bowed twice to
the Pharmacy five to lose their two
game advantage over second place
Sicna. Tho Londonvillers swept
three games and their match. Each
tczun has now won eleven while
dropping four. Pharmacy is in sec—
ond place, only one game off the
pace.

The second game of the Static-
Phurmacy contest was decided in
the last frame by the anchor man
of the Pharnuicy squad. His unusual
pick-up 01' a baby split provided
enough pilllluge for his tcam to
nosc out the statesmen by one pin.
799—708. By this one pin margin
State was dropped out of first.

Currently RPI stands near the
bottom of the league standings so
Stale has a good chance of breaking
the first place tic.

BOB VAN DAM

Plans are being formulated to
present something concrete on the
proposed Athletic Union of the
Teachers Colleges at the Annual
Inter-Collegiate Association Con-
ference to be held at Brockport
State Teachers College, November
19-21.

Tentative proposals to be present-
ed by Jerry Dunn, one of the State
delegates, include a trophy to be
awarded for basketball competition
this year. As of now, the plan calls
for each college being able to sched-
ule its own games, with the only
requirements being that they must
play at least six games with four
different State Colleges. At the end
of the season, the award will be
made on a percentage basis. and in
case of a tie, perhaps a playoff
game will be scheduled.

Another proposal to be presented
is a plan to stage a series of com-
petitive evonts on an Intramural
basis. Such events could include
bowling, volleyball, table tennis.
swimming, and badminton. Attempts
“ill be made to get one of the more
centrally located colleges, such as
Oswego or Cortland. to stage such
an event, but if this fails, a week-
end in the spring has been reserved
on our own calendar. and M.A.A.
Council is already working on plans
to stage it here.

It is recognized that all types of
proposals are going to meet with
opposition from some quarter, but
our objective is to get the ball roll-
ing so that future plans can be
made on more than hopes and
dreams. We must start somewhere.
and a logical beginning would be
some plan which will bring together
as many follows as possible so they
can “see how the rest of us live."
chkly All-American

WC'V-o received a lot of comments
about our weekly All-American bal-
lot for Colliers. Each ballot is bas-
ed on the player's performance to
date. not the preceding week only.
Here's the ballot We sent in last
Saturday :

C—Bcdnarik. Penn.

Cir—Healy, Georgia Tech.

G—Tomasi. Michigan.

T—Muddock, Northwestern.

'l‘—-—Wlsi.crt, Michigan.

E» "Poole, Mississippi.

E—-lecnburg, Michigan.

Q4Galifl'n, Army.

Isl—vSifko, Notre Dame.

l-I~Jus.ficc. North Carolina.

F—Wuikcr, S.M.U.

There are many good centers to
choose from besides Bednarik ——
Woman of Army and Sarkisian of
Norihwcslcl‘n. We‘ve switched to
Bctinurik because of his perform-
ance uuulllsi. Columbia and Navy.

Al l.i;c guul'ci posts, We switched
from li'ischer of Notrc Dame and
Henry of Army to this week's nom-
inations. 11's a tough choice to
molar. Any two you pick are All—
American.

The same goes for the tackle
spots. Add O‘Rcilly of Purdue. De-
Rogutis of Duke. Nomcnelli of Min-
nesota to the above and you have
five top—notch tackles.

Rifcnburg is one of the big keys
to Micliiuon‘s offense. Poole is still
rollingr along in his seventh year of
collch foolbuli. There are so many
outstanding backs, it's a constant
shuffle from week to week. We fig”-
urc We have four top bucks. You
may diflcr with out opinion—we'd
like to hcul‘ about it.
