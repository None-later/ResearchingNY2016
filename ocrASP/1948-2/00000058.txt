tions per sorority is due primarily
to the large number of girls in the
freshman class.

Teachers Are "Eager To Marry",
Psychologist Tells Male Population

An International New Service
release found in the Watertown
Daily Times, Watertown, New York,
recently, was headed, “Psychologist
Recommends School Teacher as
Bride." The young hopefuls of state
College should well heed the words
of Dr. James F. Bender, director of
the National Institute for Human
Relations who listed, in the press
release, ten reasons—purely intel-
lectual—why schoolmarms make
better wives than women who don't
teach school.

Dr. Bender, a widely-known psy—
chologist, urges men to marry
school teachers because his studies
have led him to the conclusion that
they are “lovable. eager to marry,
and less ‘yak-ity-yak-ity' than most
other women.”

These are the reasons he gives:

1. They are above average in
health. beauty and intelligence.

2. They have a deep affection
for children.

3. They are eager to marry, and
wish to bear two or more children.

4. They have Well-protected jobs,
safe during a recession.

5. They have nice voices and
don't talk t00 much.

6. Their regular hours and fre-

quent vacations permit them to be
good housekeepers.

'7. Their studious habits and
common sense are invaluable to
young men starting in business or
a profession.

8. Their high ideals make them
lovable, tender, sympathetic and
understanding beyond the average.

9. They are established in jobs
and ready for marriage at the gold-
en age for it—«22 to 25 years.

10. Divorce is rare among teach-
