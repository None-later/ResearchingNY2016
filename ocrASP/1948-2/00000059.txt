Charity Abroad

“Don’t pass the buck. Give it to Campus Chest."
This is the familiar slogan which is heard all over
the country during Campus Chest Drives. This is
also the slogan to which we should hearken during
State College’s Drive which starts today and con-
tinues until next Friday.

The argument maybe advanced that charity be-
gins at home but the cause for which this money
is intended should make us realize the importance
of our individual contributions. The World Stu-
dent Service Fund uses the money to send books,
equipment, and medical aid to those students en-
rolled in colleges abroad. Certainly, we need such
items in our U. S. colleges but it’s a matter of com-
parison. The WSSF is unique in its help to stu-
dents and receives the largest portion of its income
from American students and faculties.

However, this money is not only given to WSSF.
Last year it was divided among the Red Cross, In-
fantile Paralysis Foundation, Albany Community
Chest, American Cancer Societies, Tuberculosis As-
sociation and SMILES.

The canvassers have been appointed for each
group house and throughout the school. Last year
approximately $700 was collected and this year the
goal has been set at one dollar per student. The
drive has already gotten off to a good start—$46
has been collected. How about it, State College?
Shouldn’t we give one hundred percent to support
the drive?

“Don’t depend on your neighbor.
Dollar.”

Mind Changed?

Toward the beginning of the year, two editorials
were printed which urged the students, graduates,
and faculty to take advantage of the new cafeteria
plan which was suggested by the administration.
With this plan, meals could be secured in the cal-
eteria for $100 per semester.

At the time, 88 persons registered to participate
in this program. The general feeling was that they
could take care of themselves and feed themselves
at the times they desired and at the places they
desired. Those persons eligible did not want to
feel that they would have to lose their freedom and
tie themselves up for institution food.

Two months have passed and those people eli-
gible for the program have had sufficient time to
make up their minds and form their opinions as to
what they would like to do. The same advantages
as were presented early in the fall are available if
a sufficient number of persons are interested.

At least reconsider and think it over . . . perhaps
it was not such a foolhardy idea after all. Only
lSO persons in the program are necessary for its
operation.

Thanks . . .

Dramatics and Arts Council should be congratu-
lated for bringing to the State College audience
the Webster troupe and performances of “Mac-
beth” and “Hamlet.”

D&A was criticized last year alter the perform-
ance and flop 0f the I‘deic Dowling show. This
year they concentrated their efforts on one big per-
formance and certainly secured for us one of the
best possible guest artists that they could with
their current budget.

Despite the downpour Tuesday
night a considerably large crowd
came out to see the AD plays. Those
who were honestly interested were
rewarded with an evening of good
entertainment.

The first play, a comedy directed
by Tink WittPenn, had some good
moments and certainly a fine un-
derlying theme of brotherhood.
However Miss WittPenn's offering
fell down because of a minimum
of action for such a large cast
and the length of time necessary
to change sets between scenes.
The audience, consequently lost
the mood. Nevertheless, Tom
Lisker gave the play vitality, and
Ross Federico endowed the title role
with a humane quality; the comical
faces of Ed Garvin Were enjoyed by
all.

Then came the shock of the even-
ing: 8...): reared its unfortunate
head in Page Hall. Perhaps we were
in the wrong, but we interpreted

the play as a drama; but all around
us fellow students still had water
gurgling in their ears and gargle
in their mouths. It’s too bad that
Dave Shepard didn’t change his line
to “Goodbye out there” so the au-
dience might. have taken the hint
and left. In spite of this, the play,
ably directed by George Christy,
turned out successfully with excel-
lent. performances by Dave Shepard
and Joan French.

If this mass hee-ha‘wing contin-
ues, the nasty rumor may get about
that. We are all a. bunch of Mongol-
ian idiots. It could be that AD ought
to oﬂer Mother Goose for the un-
initiated and Mack Sennett for the
more “advanced” humorists in the
student audiences; or are these too
deep?

“. . . At least they enjoyed it,”
said Dave Shepard. “They laughed.”
Sure, they laughed, but then so do
hyenas.

By DAVE

Overconﬂdence has lost a football

game; and now it. seems that over~
confidence has lost. an election.
However, disregarding all theories
on why or how it happened the fact
remains that you, the voter, did it.
To use the words of Edward J.
Flynn, “you’re the boss."
‘ Two remarkable points about the
political upset; are that the presi-
dent carried the ball, unlauded and
alone; and that he made very few
commitments. It's the latter that
will make his inauguration unprec-
edented in U. S. history. As it
stands now he can either say to hell
with the Dixiecrats 01' coerce them
back into the Democratic fold; he
can apoint his chiefs and depart-
ment heads with a free mind; but
above all he can look up the avenue
and say. “now we can go ahead.”

Yes, he can say that, but will he
do that, or more specifically, will he
be able to do it? Though he has a
Democratic majority in both the
House and the Senate there is
the Republican and Southern Dem-
ocrat coalition to be feared—a pos-
sible team-up on the Taft-Hartley
and Civil Rights issues. Although
the Democratic party fervently
pledged repeal of the T-H law and
a continued fight; for civil rights, a
majority of only 2 million votes does
not indicate that the former should
be immediately thrown out or that
the latter should be hastily summed
up and incorporated into law. It’s
definitely true that action is needed
on these two points and many 0le
crs carried in the Democratic plat-
form. but the closeness of the popu-
lur vote should signin that: precau-
tion and analysis are sorely needed.
One alternative of the President's
is to call a “cooling off" period" bc-
twccn management and labor in
which both sides can get together
in an even—sided conference. and

 

DURKEE

formulate a modiﬁed labor law. The
same can be done in regard to the
Civil Rights issue—by appointing a
two—sided commission willing to lis-
ten to all representative views. A~
mong the other problems confront-
ing the new administration is the
one of pricc control. With labor
claiming that they put the new
president: into office, will 110 be able
to accomplish an effective price
control without wage control? Ouc
alone is not sufficient.

Then with the expected federal
aid to education, housing bill, and
extended foreign aid, plus a billion
dollar (lCIlCit coming up next June,
the tax situation will make even a
New Dealer's licad swim.

Yes, if the new administration
plans wisely and acts wlscly it may
not only mean tllc continued suc-
cess of the Democratic party but.
the demise of the GOP. if the
platform of the party—clout is car—
ried out, it will attract more Social-

CORRECTION, PLEASE

Everybody’s on my neck asking “where this boy
gets his nerve” writing about taking it. easy on the
parties. This calls for an explanation. It seems that.
the proof reader at the printer’s didn’t. think I could
mean such a thing, but. my statement was, “I‘m all
for a little imm'oderation in the way of celebration."
He knocked off the “im” on the word. I could never
have been in a position to say otherwise; because I
like a “good time” as well as the next guy.

Now, this is the point: We were careless; we made
too much of a good thing. Be sure you don’t. over-
imbibe. Know when to stop,, so that you don’t make
a fool of yourself before outsiders.

AND, while we're at; it, I‘d like to make it clear that
the article was not referring to the Sophomore class
only. Ever since I wrote that little letter concerning
warnings (which I meant in all sincerity), you Sophs
seem to think that I’m out for your skins. I’m not.
I’d have nothing to gain in so doing. The article was
directed to every class. We should all get. the low-
down; that’s why I used the word “We”. I included
myself, who am as much to blame as everyone else.
So let's make up; shake and be friends.
SUCCESSFUL COMEBACK

Well, D and A has certainly vindicated itself in the
es es of State students. The Margaret Webster group
was terriﬁc in the performances of “Macbeth” and
“Hamlet.” Orchids go out especially to Joseph Holland
and Alfred Ryder, who played the two title roles.

After the evening performance, we sat and chatted
with the members of the cast. over punch and cookies
in the Lounge. I was amazed to discover what. really
swell eggs they are; it was quite a shock to ﬁnd real
people after the impressions they made on the stage.

They expressed their appreciation for such ﬁne
audiences and for what they considered a warm wel—
come. Hope we see them again next year.

DON’T STOP HERE

I have always been very intolerant of intolerance
in social organizations on campus. To my mind, the
place for religious expression and segregation (one
oi many regions of intolerance) is in the religious
clubs, such as Hillel, Newman and SCA. But. this
segregation has extended to other campus groups.

In the past, some of these groups have made at-
tempts at changing their basic precepts so that ev-
erybody can be included in their society, but due to
the influence of outside organizations, alumni, ctc.,
their attempts have been thwarted.

Now, ﬁnally, the Phi Delta girls have announced a
change in their pledge requisites, so that they may
admit Catholics. That’s swell. Maybe their lead will
be followed by others who have the giunption to do as
they feel they should, rather than be bullied by out-
side pressures. Arc social groups for Americans or
are they for minority groups only?

The ball is rolling. I li(l[)(‘ it doesn't hit a stone wall.
lift-TIME

Dr. Nelson has given permission to the Senior class
to investigate the possibilities for moving the com-
nnrncemcnt exercises to a place more suitable than
Page Hall. This is a move that has been all too long
in coming. It will certainly be nice to have at least.
both your parents see you graduate, and it‘ll be even
nicer to be able to invite a couple of friends besides.
Get a great. big place, Seniors.

A REAL FRIEND

I had an interview today with Dr. Morris, the Col—
lrgc Psychologist, about my curriculum, extra cur-
riculn. future possibilities. etc. She doesn’t give out
with any of this "you should, or ought to, or you'd
l)( ttcr not," stufl‘. She puts everything in such a way
that you find yourself doing just what she has found
out for you.

Why (lo I bollicl' writing about. it? Because I want.
i.) recommcnd her to anyonc else who‘d like some
good solid advice. Whether it's poor grades or for
some personul problem, go to her. She'll welcome the
chance to help you.

"Wha’ Happens AI RPI" Answered By NEWS INNOVOIIO"

As Exchange Issues From American Universities Flood P.O.

Been feeling a. bit lonely lately?
Has the atmosphere of ye olde cap-
ital city been making you feel par-
tially buried, or at least isolated?
Then why don’t you drop down to
the P.O., if you’re not one of the
regular habituees? Of course there’s
always a certain amount of atmo-
sphere (if that’s what you call it),
what with notes and drawings on
the blackboard, Forum holding its
informal debates in the corner, and
everyone in general shouting thru
the windows (barred, incidently, for
protection, not detention). How-
ever, now something new has been
added. Leaning massively against
the far wall is what is known as
an Exchange Rack.

This latest addition to the P.0.’s
limited capacities includes the jour-
nalistic endeavors and masterpieces

 

of colleges all over the U.S.A.,
though principally from our own
old New York. And if you're the
type of person who has friends, per-
haps you’d be interested to see
what their college's rag is like.
Anyway, it wouldn’t do any harm.

If they attend a teacher training
institution in this state, you may
be sure their collegiate curricula are
being covered, for all eleven New
York State teachers' colleges’ news-
papers are received, as well as one
from Trenton.

But of course there are other
schools, which must; not be ignored.
The story of State College women
may be followed in the current files
of RPI, Siena, Union—even Syra-
cuse. And though our men’s doings

don’t create quite as much disturb-
ance (due principally to geograph-
ical distances of major female insti.
titions), the papers of Vassar, Rus-
sel Sage and Bryn Mawr might also
be of interest.

Out-of-state colleges range from
the University of Georgia to Walla.
Walla, Washington, and include
Bennington, Notre Dame and the
University of Southern California.
However, this list: can be just as
long as you want it. If there is any
college whose paper you would like
to see, just drop a note to Rosemary
Stoddard, Exchange Editor of the
NEWS, telling her the name of the
school and its address; if there is
any spirit. of cooperation in the
college, immediate action is prom-
isedl

 

Ghummbahmi

To the Editor:

 

Having been personally affected
myself, I feel it's about time this
problem, which has faced the en-
tire student body for a long time
(particularly now!) should be
brought to our attention. It’s a dis-
grace! A shame!

I am referring to the strange dis—
appearance of numerous posters,
which have been put. up at. consid-
erable effort and work, to adver-
tise various affairs. Just because a
poster is "cute," would look nice in
someone's room, brings back a pleas-
ant memory, etc., etc., is no excuse
for that person to come along at
some inconspicuous time and “lift.”
the poster. If he wants it, the least
he could do is to ask the party who
put; it up, or at any rate, have the
decency to wait until the affair in
question has occurred.

It" you doubt that; this problem
exists—just tell inc—what. happen-
ed to all the posters advertising the
hockey game between the Dog Patch
Dames and the Slobbovian Bachelor
Boys? Where have all the coke bot—
tics telling of the WAA coke-er
gone?

Not only is this thievcry inconsid-
erate of those who make the post-
ers and might like them themselves,
but it also ruins entire advertising
schemes.

So come on—— let's cut. it out.
Okay?

Spanish Club Hear
Guatemalan Gypsies

At the next regular meeting, which
will be held Thursday at 7:30 p. m.

sistant Professor in Mathematics;
Dr. Margaret Hayes, Assistant Pro-
fessor in Education; and Miss Ma-
bcl Juckmnn, Instructor in Library,
will present a humorous account of
their travels last summer. Included
in their travels was a trip to Guat-
umaln and a short stop in Havana,
Cuba.

Also lnclmlcd on the agenda are
singing, (lain-inn, and rcf‘rcslnncnts.
All faculty members and Spanish

RPI Judges Choose Zelanis
Maid Of Honor AI IF Ball

Beautiful girls in swirling
gowns, distinguished looking es-
corts in tuxedos and dark suits
stood still and tense in the
crowded ballroom awaiting the
decision of the judges. Eyes were
bright with anticipation, faces
flushed with excitement. Who
was going to be queen? Who
was going to be the maid of
honor? Who were the most
beautiful girls attending this
ball from communities far and
near? And suddenly the harm
anticipation turned into cheer-
ing applause as the judges an-
nounced the winners. And who
could describe the feelings of
the State College girls as they
saw State's own Janette Zelan-
is ’51, ascend the stage, escorted
by the judges, as Maid of Hon—
or to the Queen of R.P.I.'s an-
nual Inter-Fraternity Ball. In
commemoration of her beauty
Janette was presented with a
large bouquet of yellow tea roses.

And then. to the music of
Duke Ellington and his orches-
tra, the Queen and her court
waltzed with the judges, clim-
axing the coronation ceremony.

To the Students:

 

We’re hard-working people here
at State—we don’t stay long if we
aren’t willing to knuckle down. On
the whole, we appreciate efforts dis-
played by fellow students, but
Tuesday night at. the AD plays was
hardly an example of any such
sportsmanlike appreciation. The per-
formance put. on by the audience

was such that the performance on
the stage could not. be followed or
enjoyed.

Granted, the disturbance was not
entirely the fault of State students.
The outside trouble can and will be
curbed. However, the disturbance
caused by members of our own SA
is not understandable nor is it to
be tolerated. Lack of intelligence on
the part of students might be at
fault—but we believe it. was rather
a case of very bad manners.

All members of SA are invited to
attend the Tuesday evening work—
shops of AD. As invited guests they
should behave as such! AD is a
miniature theatre lab—the AD stu-
dents and their casts are working
week after week to learn the many
theatre crafts. They are NOT pm-
ting in long hours purely out of
vanity, as some students seem to
believe. The grind of presenting two
plays every two weeks- requires
more real interest and hard labor
than a desire to make a public dis-
play of oneself.

If those students who persisted in
being "rude" Tuesday night had
spent; one hour working on the pro-
ductions, or if they had come back-
stage afterwards in time to see the
conflicting anger and disillusion—
ment of the casts and crews, per-
haps they would understand why
the AD students are completely dis-
couragcd today.

The members of AD refuse to
continue to expose liard~worklng
casts to the treatment received by
Tuesday night's performers. Wheth—
er or not the workshops continue

depends upon the. audience behavior '-

dnrlng the rest of this season. You
am all welcome, IF you‘ve come to
learn with your fellow students up
there on the stage.

Wingate Resigns,

Keefe To Head
Primer I48-149
Stall Plans To Bond

Printer, Fills Vacancies

Upon the resignation of Gifford
Wingate ’49, as Editor-in-Chief of
Primer, the staff, at its last meet-
ing, amended the constitution in
order to enable the junior staff to
be eligible for the office. In the elec-
tilns following, Joseph Keefe ’49,
was chosen as Editor—in-Chief to
succeed Wingate.

As a result of this election, the
office of Business Editor was left
open. Arline Zeilengold ’49, was
elected to fill the position. To take
over in the capacity of chairman of
the committee investigating the new
constitution, the staff chose Jean
Ineson ’49. Christiaan Lievestro ’50,
of Public Relations, will cooperate
with IGC and other campus activ-
ities.

Posters, which will define the
standards by which the manuscripts
submitted for publication in Primer
will be judged, will be hung
throughout the buildings Monday.

Activities intended to acquaint
interested freshmen with the maga-
zine and its functions will be con-
ducted by Alvin Feldman ’49.

Primer has announced that the
printxrr of this year's magazine will
be bonded so as to avoid any re-
currence of the trouble last year.

The Primer Staff Wishes to pub~
licly thank Gifford Wingate for the
service he has rendered. Wingate
will take a position resembling that
of editor-emeritus. In this way, the
staff feels that it may use his
knowledge and still leave him free
for his work.
