Green Gremlins
Take Hockey Tilt
For Three Points

Defect Freshman Girls,
Scoring 3 In 2nd Hall

The Sophomore girls garnered the
class of 1951 three more rivalry
points when they defeated the
freshmen Tuesday in the annual
hockey game, by the score of 3-0.

Page Hall field was the scene of
the highest scoring rivalry hockey
game in years as Hicks and Thur-
low teamed up to push acrOSs three
goals for the green and white team.

The first half opened with the
fresh in green territory until the
middle of the period when a call of
sticks against center half back, Ful-
ler, seemed to turn the tide and the
Sophs took command of the ﬁeld
and never again relinquished con-
trol, except for two shortly-sus-
tained attacks by the yellow team
in the second half.

First Goal Scored

The second half got under way
with still no score and two teams
which looked as balanced as those
which fought to 0--0 ties and 1—0 and
2-0 victories in the past two years.
With the beginning of the second
half came the substitutions and the
commencement of the Soph attack.
Betty Hicks came in at right inner
(that’s on the forward line) and in
the ﬁrst few minutes of play pushed
across the initial score from the
center of the ﬁeld, past fullbacks
Farwell and Juengling and goalie

Haggerty.

Thurlow Scores No. 2 _

Following her up in a few mm-
utes, left wing “Hee—Hee” Thurlow
took a pass at the edge of her al—
ley, brought it across the striking
circle, dangerously close to the end
line, and shoved it across the goal
for the second score for the Soph
girls. Hicks came through in the
closing minutes of the game With
another tally again down the center
of the field.

Muddy Field

One of the lighter moments of
the game came in the second half
when Thurlow came over to the al-
ley fast to take a drive from Harris
and slipped into Sonia Stcpanian,
left halfback for the fresh; the two
went down together and Weller,
rushing in to recover the ball en-
thusiastically executed a backward
swan dive full in the damp, damp
earth.

Some of the more outstanding
features of the game, on the abili-
ty side. was the defensive work of
the backs of both teams. The score
for the team shows not poorer
defense work for the fresh back—
field but the strength of concerted
teamwork which comes to the Sophs
with the experience of having play—
ed together for a year. This was
evidenced by the straight line that
advanced when the Sophs were in
control of the ball as opposed to
the irregularities In speed of the
fresh line; although it was easily
noted that individually the fresh
are skilled players and should run
all over the class of ‘53.

Who's Who

teams as they started the first half:

3y HARVEY MILK

 

As the IM football season ﬁnished,
many comments have been made
as to the merits of this year's
league. Likewise there were many
criticisms.

Trying to summarize these have
resulted in the following sugges-
tions and opinions.

We have to go a long way back to
find when any intramural football
team went undefeated, untied and
unscored upon. Looking through the
NEWS ﬁles we could only ﬁnd
vague reports due to the lack of
space devoted to sports; however, it
is rumored that in 1937 or '38 some
team went unscored upon. This
year Potter Club was unscored upon
in the regular season. However, this
year Potter played ﬁve games and
did not meet all of the fraternity
teams. We are not taking any credit
from Potter but the way the foot-
ball schedule was made all rivalry
between the frats came to a halt.

The last time all four frats were
in the same league was in ’42 when
Potter nosed out SLS for the cham—
pionship.

What I am trying to say is that
I think one of the faults of this
year's football league was the way
the teams were picked for the
leagues. It is true that many inde-
pendent teams have fielded better
outﬁts than the frats, but it has
been a common fact that more of
a rivalry exists between the frats.
For this reason I would like to see
as the ﬁrst improvement for next
year's IM football league the sched-
uling of the “big-4" in the same
league.

Suggestion No. 2

Something should be done to stop
another “forfeit” league as we had
this year. Every week one could look
forward to one or more forfeits.
Why don't the captains make some
kind of a rule that any team who
forfeits two games be dropped out
of the league. It is a shame for one
team to get all set for their game
only to ﬁnd the other team could
not field six men. It can be noticed
that the forfeits were mostly by
teams that had already lost several
games. The only answer to the ques-
tion seems to be that a lot of men
only want to play for winning teams.
Can we all win?

Suggestion No. 3

It has already been forgotten
that several "incidents" arose dur-
ing some of the games. Right after
the games talk started of how to
correct this—as yet no action has
been taken—why?

The last suggestion is about the
scheduling of games. I know the

rain had a lot to do with the chang-
ing of games. But there is no ex-
cuse, as was stated last week, for
the Rivalry committee not schedul-
ing their events early in the year
so we can schedule ours. Also why
can’t we play several games on Sat-
urdays?

There is the other side of the
picture, too.

This year the overall quality of
the teams was high; for the first
time more than one team used set
plays and they helped "organize
the games. The rules have been
changed to make the game faster
and smoother. Although there were
several complaints as to the calibre
of the refs we have to give them a
hand, for the ﬁne job they did and
we can say they were a great im-
provement over last year’s whistle-
tooters.

Enthusiasm Lacking

Looking back at this year's games
as compared with last years, one
would find one thing mISSing—en-
thusiasm. Last year, one can re-
member, large crowds were at each
and every game, even the games
that decided the cellars of the
leagues. This year you could have
counted the amount at any game
on your fingers.

As the case has been with every
sport there have been many “un-
sung” heroes. I'm not going to name
all these “unsung” heroes but I
would like to mention that the
great passing and running that took
place this year could not have hap-
pened if backs like Amyot and Sad-
oway decided not to block 01' if the
forward walls decided to take it
easy. It must be remembered that
the Schicks and Powells made vic-
tories possible. Another fact that a
lot of people forget about is the de-
fense play of the line. These men
make up the "unsung" heroes and
they make football.

Rain Postpones
Playoiis, Rivalry

Due to the sudden outburst of
rain Wednesday the play_off game
between KB and Potter Club has
been postponed. Also the game be-
tween the “A” League stars and the
“13" League stars, and the rivalry
football game were washed out. As
yet the new dates for these games
have not been set.

The teams for the “A” League-
“B” League game were chosen by
the captains of the respective
leagues from all the teams in each
loop except the We first place
tcanis (KB and Potter). The rosters
are as follows:

“A” League
Captain—King

State Drops Two,
Slides To Second

The Engineers from RPI squared
matters for the season by taking
two out of three games from the
State keglers Wednesday night at
the Playdium. This defeat dropped
the statesmen into second place,
two games behind pace-setting Si-
ena. The varsity squad rolled 9. tot-
al of 936 to take the ﬁrst game, but
RPI came back to grab the last
two games by a wide margin.

This setback was a costly one for
State because it dropped them out
of the lead for the ﬁrst time in four

weeks. Siena took advantage of
State's misfortune by sweeping
three games from Albany Law

School. This three_game victory as-
sured them of undisputed posses-
sion of ﬁrst place.

Individual honors went to Lyle
Walsh who rolled a three game tot-
al of 538 including high single game
of the evening, 214. Bob Dickinson
was the only other Statesman to
crash the 500 circle although Hank
Farley's 206 effort was second best
in that division.

Next week, State will battle Siena,
and this will undoubtedly be one of
the better matches of the season.
It will be an all-out duel for first
place.

Walsh Clarifies

Contingency Fund;
Lists Procedures

Lyle Walsh, Vice-President of
MAA, has issued the following in-
formation rcgarding the MAA-
WAA contingency fund.

The MAA-WAA contingency fund
is set up within the Student Asso-
ciation to render financial assist-
ance to those members of MAA and
WAA who are injured in athletic
events sponsored in whole or In
part by either organization and who
require medical attention. Rivalry
is not an MAA-WAA sponsored
program.

Obtained From Surplus

This fund is obtained from any
surplus of MAA or WAA budgets
each year. Running on a tight bud-
get for the past few years, the fund
has not been increased and at pres-
ent it amounts to $542.64. It is
easily seen that the fund cannot
stand too many major injuries.
Serious injury can be avoided so
.please participate with caution.
Prior to making claims for bills
through this fund it is suggested
that the Medical Insurance plan, if
possessed by the claimant, be used.

Procedure Outlined

The procedure for any members
of MAA or WAA injured, or who
suspects lie/she is injured, while
participating in any athletic event
officially sponsored, in whole, or in
part, by MAA or WAA, is as follows:

1. He should report the injury, as
suspected injury, immediately to the
official, or officials, in charge.

2. Efforts should also be made to
report the injury to Miss Johnston,
Mr. Hathaway or Mr. Gibson, or, if
unavailable, to a member of MAA
or WAA Councils so that competent
medical care may be provided.

3. If immediate medical attention
is necessary and it is not possible
to report the injury as mentioned in
“2" above. medical attention should
be obtained and the injury reported
as soon as possible.

Method of Payment

Payment for medical expenses in—
curred and charged under this fund
shall be handled as follows:

1. The bill shall be made out by
the doctor rendering the medical
attention and shall be given to, or
mailed to, the person receiving the
medical attention.

2. The person shall present. said
bill to Miss Johnston, Mr. Hatha-
way. Juanita Evans or Charles
Frail at his/her earliest. convenience.

3. Any bill loss than $100 may
be approved in a joint meeting of
MAA and WAA Councils.

4. Any bill in excess of $100
must be approved in a joint meet—
lift); of MAA and WAA Councils and
also must bc approvcd by Student
Association in a rcgular or special
assembly.

By PAUL BUCHMA"

If you're trying to ﬁnd Kenny
George, captain of this year’s bas-
ketball team, just look for a large
group of people that are laughing
uproarously; he’ll probably be right
in the middle causing it all. That
is the impression Kenny gives when
you ﬁrst meet him, and a very
pleasant meeting it was.

George is a native Albanian; he
grdauated in 1943 from Philip
Schuyler High School, where he
was president of the Senior class.
He immediately went into the U. S.
Army Air Corps. was in for two and
one-half years, and when discharg-
ed, returned to his studies at State.
Now a Junior, he is majoring in
Mathematics, and minorlng in Phys-
cs.

Made All-Albany Teams

He was active in athletics both in
High School and here at State. He
played three years of varsity base—
ball, basketball and track at Schuy-
ler, and in his Senior year, All-Al-
bany teams in those three sports.

 

 

His participation in sports at
State is not limited to Varsity
teams, for he is a member of “The
Ham and Eggers Association," and
plays intramural athletics with
them. But he is known best about
school for his outstanding work as
a team player in Varsity basketball
and baseball. He has played Varsity
ever since his freshman year, but
doesn't particularly care to talk a—
bout the first two years, when "we
had just about enough boys in
school to field a team—but nothing
more."

Remembers Utica Game

Kenny likes to remember last
year's Utica game. as the "Feds"
beat the "Utes" in a hard fought,
close contest in which team work
made the difference between victory
and defeat.

“We were at our peak for that
one. But this year‘s team ought to
be better yet. Our spirit has never
been higher, and if the student body
will get behind the Loom, they‘ll
have something worthwhile to cheer
for. This year they‘ll see u better
brand of basketball.

George bemoancd the fact that
most students at State have it dis-
torted conception of the part ath-
letics plays In the school program.

"Anyone," he said, “can go out for
a Varsity sport. But once you go
out for that sport. you are barred
from Intramural competition in
that sport. When you come right
down to it, Intramural athletics are
more exclusith than Varsity sports."

George works nights at thc down-
town 'l‘rlnity Boys Chib. and coupl-
cd with his school hours, bnskclball
practice, and work, he has a very
full schedule.

Ken got uuirricd in 1045. just be-
lorc hc rctin'ncd to school. He says
that his wife is expecting it "son" in
March. “Don't just write child," he
pleaded. “Wlnil, do you want to do,
jinx inc?"

Potter Boaters
Nip Angels, 2-0

A highly touted Potter soccer
team had their offense curbed last
Saturday as they squeezed by a
strong Angel team, 2-0. Potter's of-
fence clicked early in the first per-
iod as Jim Juisto treated the ball
through the goal posts. The play
started deep in Potter territory with
the ball being advanced to Angel
territory; then Al Kaehn passed to
Juisto who scored.

The remainder of the ﬁrst period
saw the ball change hands many
times with neither team being able
to score. The Angels' defense tight-
ened considerably and Potter found
it difficult to advance the ball be-
yond midﬁeld.

Angels Threaten

Midway in the second period the
Angels began to sweep downfleld
and for the remainder of the period
knocked at Potter's door but were
unable to score. During the diary
a perfect try for a score was thwart-
ed by the erorts of Harvey Clear-
water, Potter goalie. who deflected
the ball which just missed going
through the goal-posts.

Last llalf Deadlock

The second and third periods
found both teams in a virtual dead—
lock. Defense became the outstand-
ing feature of play in these two
periods with both teams threaten-
ing but unable to score. By winning
this game Potter needs only one
more victory to clinch the champ-
ionship.
