at the Chinese Auction. The
Honorable Sparkee Vaughn will
be Auctioneer.

Cross To Give
Concert-Lecture

Music Council will present Mil-
ton Cross, noted commentator, au-
thor, and music critic, in a concert-
lecture, on the evening of Decem-
ber 2, according to Jean Munro ’49,
President.

Cross is known from the Satur-
day afternoon radio program, which
he conducts from the Metropolitan
Opera House. He also has several
other programs, including “Metro-
politan Auditions of the Air” and
“Piano Playhouse.”

Miss Munro states that in the
program given by Music Council,
Cross will discuss the opera and
take his listeners behind the scenes
of the Metropolitan with his ex-
periences and anecdotes of the stars
that he has known. In this project
he will be assisted by a quartette of
young opera stars who will sing
excerpts of the opera he discusses.
The audience will learn something
of life backstage.

Your name doesn’t have to be
Hwang H0 or Peking 'P‘ete to
make you eligible to bid. The
only reason they call it a Chi-
nese Auction is because you
won’t know what you’re getting
until you get there. (It’s a well
known fact, you know, that the
Chinese are short on words and
long on surprises.)

Rare bits of paraphernalia
and privileges will be virtually
given away to the highest bid-
der, so don't miss a single sweet
second. The buy of the day is
a surprise package. the contents
of which will be known only aft-
er purchase. A word to the wise
is sufficient, so, if you go steady,
have your nickels ready.

A goal of ten dollars has been
set up. which will be used to
purchase a rivalry bulletin
board.

Mary Fennel played the lead
with touching reality. and Jerry

stayed dead during the entire

giggled as they became aware
of slight similarities between
