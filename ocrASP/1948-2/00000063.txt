To the Editor:

Last week an article appeared in
the NEWS. summing up the good
and bad points of the past Intra-
mural Football season. The article
was written by a member of the
NEWS staff who was an active par-
ticipant in the league as a player,
referee, and one of the ﬁve team
representatives consistently present
at meetings. For this reason, it de-
serves attention. As manager of the
league I would like to air a few of
my views on the topic, for what
they are worth:

1. The most important factor is
the choice of a league manager. I
don’t feel that I was completely
aware of the responsibilities in-
volved and I hope to orient our
manager elect on some of the pit-
falls involved.

2. Next in line of responsibility
are the team captains. Except for
the ﬁrst meeting, attendance never
reached 100%. Most of the time I
had to be satisﬁed with six or seven
of the thirteen possible. This makes
all administration ineffective.

3. The freshmen need an orien—
tation on football as well as how to
ask for a date. Because of ignor-
ance, many signed to play, and la-
ter had to quit for various reasons.
Others did not sign up, were not
organized and just didn’t play, al-
though they wished to.

4. The refereeing, as a rule,
smelled. I know, because I was a
referee. So far, no practical solu-
tion to this problem has been of-
fered, but I welcome all ideas on
the subject.

Basically, I think these are the
four problems which tend to dis-
rupt the Intramural Football pro-
gram.

I now turn to the one suggestion
by Mr. Milk with which I violently
disagree. He suggests that the Frat-
ernity teams be put in one league,
because, “it has been a common fact
that more of a rivalry exists be-
tween the frats."

The teams for each league \vere
chosen by the “long straw" method
this year because I felt: 1. Any at-
tempt to classify the better teams
in one league, if successful, would
defeat the purpose of a play-off
game. 2. Leaving the selection of
leagues to one person opens him to
charges of fixing or “stacking” the
leagues.

If what Mr. Milk says about ri-
valry is true, then putting all the
frat teams in one league would
concentrate the interest on one
league to the detriment of the oth-
er—-lf it were true. As far as I can
see‘ putting SLS and KB in the “A”
league would only have increased
rivalry so far as KB was a good
football team which might be able
to topple EEP. Within the "A"
league, I believe there was more
rivalry in the REP-Angel game
than in the perennial feud with
KDR, simply because of the caliber
of the teams involved. As a ﬁnal
word, may I say that no place in
the aims of intramural sports is
there a sentence or a word which
indicates that dcvoiopmcnt of fra-
ternal rivalry is a goal to be con-
sidered.

My thanks to the fellows who
were so helpful the past season.
Over 100 fellows played ballA—and
that is the important measure of
success.

Basketball Pep Rally
Slated Before Opener

lntra-Sqdod Tilt
ls Feature Event

Tumbling Demonstration

To Open Activmcs

MAA will initiate this year's bas-
ketball season with the proverbial
bang, when on December 1, they
will hold a Pep Rally in the Page
Hall gymnasium from 7130-9 :30 pm.

The committee for the rally, as
appointed by MAA, is Lyle Walsh
’50, Chairman, Al Holliday ’50, and
Jay Miller ’51. A radical and badly-
needed departure from the overall
pattern of Pep Rallies of the past
is promised.

Program Planned

The program as planned is ex-
tensive. A demonstration of ad-
vanced tumbling stunts by the
Tumbling Club will start the activ-
ities. The faculty has been challeng-
ed by a student team to a Volley-
ball match, and if accepted, a lively
game is forecast. (But, who trusts
forecasts and polls today?). The
Cheel‘lcfldlilg squad will be present
to help lead the singing and cheer-
ing, and the evening will be topped
off by an intro-squad basketball
game.

No Charge for Rally

Thor-e will be no charge, and the
entire student body is urged to at-
tend.

The team itself has been busy
this past week in sharpening up its
game by means of two informal
scrimmage games. Wednesday they
traveled to Troy to play the RPI
Engineers, and yesterday, before a
small crowd of students, they scrim—
maged with the Cobleskill Aggies.
Coach Enthusiastic

Coach Merlin Hathaway has been
enthusiastic about some of the new
additions to the team. Bob Brown,
a fresl'iman, has been looking good,
and is playing on the Varsity. Ed
Matthews, a transfer, is another
new face on the Varsity. Up from
last year‘s J.V. are Albert “Killer”
Kaolin, Dave Wetherby, Paul Car—
ter, and Jim Warden Jim Jiusto,
although not new in the scnool, is
new to the team.

In general. the team is in good
physical shape. Starter Tom “O'Bic”
O'Brien, however, is out indefinitely
with a slight case of grip.

Tickets for otit of town games
will not ordinarily be sold in ad-
vance here at State, but if there is
a big enough demand for them,
there will be advance sales at re-
duced rates.

After the final cuts, the team
shupcs tip as follows:

Varsity Squad

Robert Brown, Paul Curl/er, Sey-
mour Fersh. Kenneth George, James
Jiuslo, Albert Kaehn, Melvin Lim-
sky, Lincoln Marscllo, Edward Mut-

WAA Council met at Pierce Hall
Wednesday night to choose sports
captains for the mid-winter and
winter sports. The fall sport sea-
son closes by Thanksgiving and all
credit must be earned in fall sports
by that time.

It was decided that because of
the weather conditions, riding, vol-
leyball, archery and tennis clubs
will be continued again in the spring
with the credit carrying over. There
was not a majority of girls who
were able to earn credit in these
sports.

Basketball League Planned

Elly Adams and Ruth Smith, Jun-
iors, and Phyllis Harris '51, were
appointed basketball captains. The
games will be played in the Page
Hall gym on Tuesday and Thursday
evenings and on Saturday mornings.
A sign-up sheet is on the WAA bul-
letin board for any team that would
like to be scheduled in the league.
A game schedule will be posted fol-
lowing- the Thanksgiving vacation.
It was decided that the grads would
be allowed to play in the league if
they are willing to form their own
team. They are restricted from
playing on any sorority or group
house team.

Chosen bowling captains were
Edythe Kelleher ‘50, and Audrey
Weller ’51. The scheduled games
will be played on Tuesday and
Thursday afternoons. A different
system of scoring is to be introduc-
ed this year. The requirements for
unsupervised games will be posted
later by the captains.

Lucy Lytle '49, and Mary Lou
Reed '51, were chosen ping-pong
captains. The ping-ping sign-up
sheet for the tournament is posted.

Ken Thompson ‘50, will head the
winter sports which include skating,
skiing, sleigh-riding and tobaggon-
ing. To earn credit in these sports,
anyone can report the hours she
has spent participating in them to
the captain.

 

 

Life-Saving Offered

The pool at the Jewish Commu-
nity Center is reserved on Thurs—
day nights for swimming and life-
saving. Swimming will mcct from 7
to 8:30, from the week following
Thanksgiving until February. At

'50. After i'lfte-cn hours of practice
and a test, the passing girls will be
awarded their life-saving certifi-
cuies.

A general mecting of all girls iii-
tcrcstcd in any sports program will
bc held on November 30 at 3:30 pin.
The captains will present their
plans for the scuson and hope to
hch additions or suggestions by
other students.

Tumbling ci'cdit is being kept for
WAA by Ruth Mutlcsoll '50, Score-
tui'y of the organization. A. total of
ten hours in one season must be
ucquircd for credit.

Bowling League

Intramural bowling was resumed
again this fall with the first games
being rolled on the Rice alleys Wed-
nesday afternoon. This week’s
games saw many teams jump to an
early lead.

Potter Subdues Gents

Potter Club took three games
from the Gents. Charlie Hubbard’s
163 single and Bob Reno's 467 triple
paved the way for Potter’s triple
victory. Doug Thorne's 148 was high
single while DeLucca’s 389 was high
triple for the Gents. Potter showed
a great deal of bowling ‘pOWer by
overcoming the Gents by a very wide
margin.

Van Dcrzee Takes Three

Van Derzee defeated the Fools in
three straight games. Ray Rapacz
took both high single and high tri-
ple honors with 190 and 521. Ben-
nett was high in both departments
for the Fools with 170 and 473. Van
Derzee jumped to an early lead in
the first game and was never head-
ed in their clean sweep of three
games.

KDR Downs KB

Kappa Delta Rho led by Morris'
156 single and 443 triple took three
from Kappa Beta. Goritbein had
the high single and triple for KB
with 144 and 400 respectively. The
last game was very close with KB
losing out by 26 pins. The first and
second games were KDR's safely, as
they swept them with large margins.
Beavers Whitewash Faculty

A strong Beaver team took three
games from the Faculty team. The
Beavers were led by Lainannn’s 202
single and 525 triple, which are high
for the season thus far. Although
the Faculty lost three games the
second game was very close, being
dropped by nine pins.

SLS Victorious

A highly touted SLS team sub-
dued a Fearless Five squad by two
games to one. 81.8 was led by Mon-
roe's 168 single and 480 triple. Bill
Dunn paved the way for the Fear-
less Flve squad with a 157 single
and a 401 triple.

The Faculty originally intended
to field two teams but one team
withdrew from league competition.
Therefore one team will draw one
bye a week.

Next week‘s schedule is as follows:
Alleys Teams

l-2—Jei'ks vs. Beavers.

5-6~—Van Derzec vs. Faculty 1.

Volleyball Team
Begin Activities

Volleyball started off Wednesday
with four games; two openers were
from the “A” league. the fraternity
teams, and the two games following
from “B” league, consisting of in-
dependent teams. Ten teams have
so far signed up to take part in the
tournament.

SLS started out fast taking the
first game from KDR by a close
score of 16-14. KDR reversed the
order, however, in the following two
games, to win them both with a
rather decided edge of 15-9 and 15-
7, giving them the necessary two out
of three games.

Potter Club was a winner when
KB failed to present a full team,
making a forfeit necessary.

VDZ Swamps Angels

Van Derzee took two straight
from the Angels by a wide margin.
The scores of the games were: 15-2
and 15-3, respectively. Both teams
were short a man for the first
game.

.Burts and the Mitey Mites volley-
ed for a long time before the serve
was decided. A close game followed:
first one team scoring and then
the other. Finally Burt's team pull-
ed ahead to win 15-11. The second
followed with more of the same
kind of playing. In this game the
Mitey Mites went ahead from time
to time; however, they were unable
to hold their lead and Burt's team
came forward to win 16-14.

Volleyball schedule for next week:

The age old, yet romantic Ameri-
can saga of marrying your high
school sweetheart; traditional win-
ning of school letter, and being
captain of the team; the corny but
real story of returning to school
after discharge from the Army; all
these are elements in the life of
Seymour “Sy” Fersh, veteran court
campaigner here at State.

“Sy” is a native of Eoughkeepsie,
New York, where he was a class
officer, and won his Varsity letters
in Basketball and Track. Drafted
shortly after he left high school.
even though he had been accepted
at State, he spent two years in the
army, where after service in Europe,
he was transferred to Fort Knox,
Kentucky. There he played basket-
ball for the Fort Knox team, play-
ing against such top—flight teams as
the University of Kentucky iRﬂth
Beard and Company), and Louis-
ville.

Enters State College

Next stop in his crowded life
was State. Here he became active
in school activities, including two
honor fraternities, Kappa Phi Kap-
pa, and Pi Gamma Mu. He is an
active member of Kappa Beta, cur-
rying' their color:; in intramural
football and softball. Not content
to play Varsity buskctbzill, he went
out for the tennis team, and made
that too. With the cxpci'iciiccd
gained in this way.  is looking
forward to coaching tho Milne ten-
nis team when he starts pi'uclicc
teaching there next scincslcr.

Late in August of 1947. while still
:1 Sophomore, "Sy" got married. He
lives now in an upui'tmciit lli‘lll' the
school, yci, since his marriage oc-
curred just after the closc of the
summer session, muny of tin- stil-
dents at State ncvci' lt'ill‘lll‘cl of 1110

expressed no desire to livc here,
and made it plain that his l'ondcsi
hope was to teach nowhcrc but in
Pcughkci‘psic, his “home town" and
“ninth mutt-r.“

Wednesday night, the statesmen
narrowed Slcna's pace-setting mar-
gin to one game by taking two out
of three in their battle for first
pIaCe honors in the Intercollegiate
Bowling League. Siena nosed out
the varsity squad in the second
game by thirty pins to prevent
State from sweeping the “like game
set. If the home forces had been
able to take all three games. they
would have been in first place with
a comfortable one game lead.

The best individual performance
turned in by the statesmen was a
three game total of 545 rolled by
Captain Joe Carosella. Bob Dickin-

Last Saturday saw Potter Club
clinch the Soccer League title by
turning back the Scrubs, 6-2. The
team This been undefeated during
the season.

Although Potter turned back
their opponents, they were unable
to score until the third period.
Early in the first period, Nolan
Eowell emerged from a fury direct-
ly in front of Potter's goal and
booted the ball through the goal
for the Scrub score.

Throughout the remainder of the
first and second periods, the ball
changed hands many times with
the Scrubs threatening time and
again but unable to score. Midway
in the second period, Potter push-
ed through its first fully and tied
the score. The play was originated
at midi‘icld, then in front of the
Sci'ubs‘ goal. Jim Jiusto oassed to
Al Kathn who scored.

Potter nctlcd illliilllf‘l' score near
the end of thc pcriod on a boot
by Austin Muiiroc. Again achn
i'igurcd in the scoring us he passed
from a. corner kick for the score.

Football Playoffs
Slated For Today

This afternoon Potter Club, win-
ner of the “A” League champion-
ship, will tackle KB, winner in the
"B" League. Tomorrow the Sophs
will tangle with the fresh in the
annual Rivalry game.

After long delays the play-off
game will finally come, at 4 p. in.
this afternoon. The two undefeated
teams will meet to decide the cham-
pionship of the 1948 Intramural
football season. From all indications
of the past season, it looks like KB
will be passing with Sy Fersh, while
Potter will be running with Carter,
Warden and Lansky. It should shape

up to be a fine game with neither"

team holding any decisive edge. Be-
si lcs riefendlng its title, iFotter will
also try to keep their unscored up-
on i'ccord clean.

Rivalry Game

With the Gl'CLll Gremlins, coach-
ed by Pat Dooley, and fielding a

under “119d” Sanderson will have
their hands full tomorrow, when
'51 and '52 mix in their rivalry
football classic. Last year '51 nipped
‘5J in a tight game. 9—7, and seem
to have a stronger team this year;
liowcvci', from the looks of this
year's Intramural league games the
frosh \vlll ficld a fast and smooth
running scxict.

The time of thc games will be
1:31) pm. and it will be at Page field.
