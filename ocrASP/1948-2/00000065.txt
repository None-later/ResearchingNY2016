Where Is it?

About a year ago the legislature of New York
appropriated money for new dormitories at teach-
ers’ colleges. This was done partly to alleviate
the crowded conditions of post war enrollment, but
more speciﬁcally, to correct the long-standing neg-
lect of dormitory facilities for state colleges. Since
that time, little or nothing has been heard from
the state.

In the meantime, Albany, as well as ten other
teachers’ colleges have had to struggle with greatly
increased enrollment. Every possible resource has
been called upon, with students being placed in
private homes, locker rooms and barracks. We
are not alone in this problem, and probably have
less to contend with than the majority of private
colleges.

Disregarding the swollen post-war enrollment,
however, you will ﬁnd that the dorm facilities of
the teachers’ colleges of New York State have too
long been neglected. If comparisons are needed,
take a look at Pennsylvania’s colleges and then
look at Cortland or New Paitz. What help Albany
has received with living quarters has come mainly
from the alumni.

N0, the problem of dormitory space is not a post-
war problem, but one that has existed and shows
every indication of growing considerably. Enroll-
ment in this year's freshman class far exceeds that
of either the Sophomore, Junior or Senior classes,
containing the so—called war students. But while
the state cuts through red tape and waits for prices
to go down, the immediate needs of “tomorrow‘s
teachers” are going sadly untended. As one gradu-
ate of State has so aptly put it, “You can't live in
blueprints.”

The state‘s cry for more teachers has been
answered with the increased enrollment of this
year’s freshman classes . . . and the need for new
dorms has been forcibly demonstrated. Unless
the state takes some action on the new dorms,
however, the need will cease to exist. You can’t
train teachers on the sidewalks.

Service . . .

in an attempt to coordinate the social service
activities of State and eliminate duplication, five
()iganizations on campus, SCA, l-liilei. Newman.
ICC and SMILES have combined their efforts in
an "All State Community Service." in coordinat-
ing their activities they are attempting to enlarge
the scope of their work.

This new Service organization will work with
Clinton Square Settlement House, Booker T.

the YMCA. and city hospitals. Here is a
chance to work with undcrprivilcged children
for the commnuity. . .a chance to obtain
experience, and to translate theory into action.
Aside from this, it pays off in better relations with
the city.

Each of the live organizations involved is open-
ing a drive this week to recruit workers. You can
sign with them. The people of Albany iiccd your
help. I)on't let them down.

STATE COLLEGE NIWS. FRIDAY.

By JOHN JENNINGS

 

 

Guest Columnist

Approach With Caution! Look In
All Directions! Proceed With Care!
The Life You Save May Be Your
Own! These are the signs, familiar
to those who travel the nation’s
highways, that warn of the impend-
ing dangers wherever one flow of
trafﬁc crosses another. Their value
lies in the fact that they call to
mind the necessity for individuals
to manifest an active interest in
their own and other's welfare.

As students. we are literally at
the crossroads of one semester‘s ac-
tivity on campus. The warnings, re-
garding our social and academic
pursuits have been given. and now
is the time to consider seriously
our collegiate futures. This period
marks the end of the initial ad-
justments that freshmen have had
to make to a new, and in some
cases. a not so wonderful set of ex-
periences. They are often subjected
to a great deal of personal tragedy
that goes unnoticed in our larger
school circles, yet if they can with
stand the pressure of these events
the changes in their outlook better
fit them for their status as adults.
Sophomores are beginning to un-

 

communicalwnd

 

To the Editor:

Now I believe it is good time to
ask where the fraternities and so-
rorities on this campus are going. if
they are going any place at all.
Tremendous changes are occurring
or are about to occur all about us.
Without going any farther than the
boundaries of this campus we can
see these changes.

State College is rapidly expand-
ing. We should be proud of that
fact, but more important we should
be making plans to enlarge, expand
and modify our social activities, as
they revolve around fraternity and
sorority life, to keep up with the
college growth.

This growth can mean several
things to the fraternities and so-
rorities. They can profit by it and
grow with it or they can be left
behind to die by strangulation at
their own hands. As the student
body gets larger the responsibility
of the social life among the stu-
dents is going to fall more and more
to these organizations. A large stu-
dent body makes it almost impos-
sible to maintain enough all—col—
lege social functions to satisfy the
whole body during the course of a
year.

Fraternities and sororities can
look forward to yet. another alter-
native commensurntc with the col-
lege cxpansion. When the college
completes its plans for dormitory
and academic expansion. which are
well in the blue print stage now.
there is the possibility that w
will lill(i our college life restricted
to the exclusive use of these facil—
ities. At flint time the fraternities
and sororities on this campus are
going to be forced to justify their
continued existence by being able
to present it strong, iiciiitliy, inu-
Lure and progressive attitude
toward college life and post-college
life. We must bear in mind that for
its the latter means the teaching
profession.

Beyond liic actiiai physical
growth of ilic college, however,
there are other changes occurring.
'l‘hc complexion of the student. body
has undergone a change. and if we
can judge by the present national
trends the change will persist. for
some time to t'tlllil'. The recent war
and present draft has meant. and
will Illt'itll flint. more and more of
ilic nicii students will be entering
Stutt- iii a later age bringing with
them a "world experience" above
and beyond that which is gathered
tioiii hiin school life.

What is it. flint. the fiutcrnilics
and sororities ('llll do in this year
ill-lit to aid and strengthen Iiicll'
litihllloii'.’ l have uli'cully ciiuiiicral—
cd oiic step lilitl can be taken. that
oi the increase ill their nuiiibcra it
is gratifying to see that u bciun-
iiiiig has already been iiindc in my
other i'ccoimncndniions. biil a in!
more can ln- tiiiili'

’l'hcy must continue to put their
bidding and rushing procedure on u
more rational basis thereby making

  

 

derstand the full meaning of Rival-
ry and its effects upon individual
associations. The Juniors are be-
ginning to feel, and rightly so, their
importance to the general scheme
of things. Speaking as a Senior, I
feel that a very important trans—
formation has taken place in our
ranks.

After almost four years of study
and contact with a world of new
ideas and personalities, it is right
to expect this group to give evi-
dence of maturity in judgments
and behavior. Of all the four groups
I think that their making adjust-
ments to new situations, and clari-
tying their specific roles in student
activities is most difﬁcult. for their
extended experiences have made
them highly critical of all group
proceedings. This is not in itself a
disastrous condition, but one to be
desired, if other values are not for-
gotten. The presence of some sort
of irritant always makes for better
administration, and this acts as a
constant reminder of our own limit-
ations and the need for cooperative
student action.

In another respect we have
reached the crossroads in relations
with members of the faculty. On all
levels we have evaluated the merits
of certain teaching procedures, and
in turn, our own claSS responses
have been carefully catalogued. Our
success or failure in college is large—
ly determined by the eﬂ‘ectivencss
of these personal contacts.

It is imperative that we preserve
our own personal integrity; how-
ever, this should not be done at
the expense of others. The way to
understanding is broad and is beset.
with many physical and spiritual
obstacles. We may not agree on the
methods or principles of living. but
there is nothing in the ﬁeld of hu-
man relations that should prevent.
our walking together in peace.

 

it possible for every man and wo-
man student to make his or her
choice after sane deliberation. The
exuberance and vitality exhibited
during the pledge period must not
die during four years of member-
ship because of an unfortunate
choice made in the first semester
scramble.

The potential pledgcs must be
given more time. Pledging during
the second semester at the earliest
will help alleviate this problem. The.
fralcrnitics and sororities must
modify their pledge procedures to
have them correlate more with the
attitudes that the pledges bring iii-
io the. organization. It is not fair
to expect the pledges of 1948 to
abide by the traditional procedure
of lti~ttl merely because such a pro—
ccdurc is traditional.

population. Fi'alci'nities and sorori-
ties must be prepared to alleviate
lhe resultant pressure for brief pcr-

degree of maturity shown by the
college population.

We can advance in yet another
realm and one with more far-

Common-Slated

By BILL LYONS

The Gammon-Stator Is given the widest latitude as
author of this column, although his viewpoints do
not necessarily reflect those of the Sena Common
News.

 

 

When I told someone the other day that I was
going to write this column, they compared the event
to Thanksgiving something about the turkey
not being the only thing that was stuffed. Here I go
anyway. and like my predecessors, I invite all com-
ments, criticisms and iieWs from the column's readers.

The delegates to the Inter—Collegiate Association
Conference have turned in their re )ort to Student
Council but the overall impression of that report is
worth mentioning. That is. when compared to the
other colleges, Albany can be proud of its pcsition.
Regardless of the gripers and detractors in our stu-
dent body, we make a pretty ﬁne showing as regards
student government. academic standards, curriculum.
and just plain know-how of organization. Students
from some of the other schools can't imagine a stu-
dent organization without faculty intervention. And
we may kid about our Dooleys and Langsleys with
their “Article 5. section 6 readings" at our business
meetings but when you see a Ineeting that doesn‘t
conform to any set procedure. you can appreciate
efﬁciency. Sure we have our faults. but looking back
we can see progress and we‘ll make more as time
goes by. The next time that you hear someone grip-
ing, ask yourself how much that person has done
to better things here at. State. You‘ll be surprised
at the conclusions.

One. of our weak spots is our Student-Faculty re-
lations . . . they're on a book-basis with little social
activity. Now a suggestion for their betterment
comes from the faculty itself. They have suggested
a faculty talent. show and froth the reports there
seems to be a good deal of talent among them. Such
a show will hav: a second contribution. Any profits
derived will be donated to the War Memorial that
the student body decides on. Nothing definite yet.
but it sounds like a fine idea.

Hot Rock Idea: Why not put blocks under the
“shorty” lockers in the men's locker room, They
would be appreciated by the members of the Back
Benders Brotherhood who occupy those lockers.

There was a movement among sororities and fra-
ternities to move the pledging period into the sec-
ond semester. Its supporters felt that such a chungc
would eliminate much of the confusion among the
piospectivc plcdgccs and would also give the organi-
zations a better opportunity to judge the freshman.
What hapinrncd to it. and what are the arguments
against such a move?

The cafeteria plan that flopped (not cnough sub—
scribersi and has been resurrected sounded like a
good one, One of the reasons given for its failure
was that some students did not want. 1.) “tie them-
selves up for institution food.“ That may be, but
there is also an adverse i‘ccliiig toward tiic cal‘clcria
brought. on by its prices and by the amounts and
quality of its food. thilicr this attitude is founded
or not. possibly more knowledge as to how the sug-
gcsted plan will be set up would case many minds
and bring ill more customers.

lliiy 'cm. wrap 'em, and drop ‘eiii. Wc‘rc speaking
of the gifts for the kids at lhc Albany Home. (in
Monday, boxes will be put in lower Draper for re-
ceiving these gifts biil that's not all for you to do.
Make plans to attend the Christmas party at. the
Home on Thursday. December 16. Any inconvenience
that you may have will be amply rewarded by IilI‘
happiness that you can give to some youngster.

Sophs_ Hail Return Of Cup,-

Found in Men’s Locker Room

Hallelujahs and whadda-ya-
knoivs. the Campus Day cup
is back from its mysterious jour-
ney.

With conscience as its guide,
the cup decided to climb from
some dark corner on the day
before the old cup or a sim—
ilar one had to be returned to
the Rivalry Committee. A fresh-
man. nameless. found the cup
wrapped in nCWspupcr on top
of his locker in the men's
locker-room. He ISaints pre—
serve us) gave it to Tony Fro-
chilo who in turn informed Don
Ely of its recovery. Luckily.
another cup had iioi yet been
purchascd, although plans were
underway.

Of course, it is regrettable
that. the cup decided to leave
the Sophomore Party and go
into hiding. causing the Dean
to (‘t‘ll>,lll‘(‘ the Sophomore Class
and officers but. it. is back and
perhaps it. is best to say no
more about it.

It would be interesting
though. to know who had the
cup and where he had it. Pcr-
hops the cup was in the sum"
place :i‘-. the one that disap—
peared last year.

Experts Advise College Students To Give Exams

To Take it Easy

In order to make college students
more conscious of accident preven-
tion over Christmas vacation. the
Lumbernians Mutual Casualty
Company, in cooperation with the
National Safety Council is sponsor-
ing a safety drive during that per-
iod. In conjunction with this, an
editorial contest is being sponsored
at the same time.

Much literature has arrived at
the NEWS office during the past
week. emphasizing the need for
such a campaign. One survey cited,
made by the chief psychologist of
Lumbcrmans Mutual Casualty Com-
pany, involved 100 motorists who
were psychologically studied after
their arrest for a trafﬁc violation.
The following results were ob-
tained: “Onc driver was insane and
one was an active epileptic. Three
were handicapped physically, six
had serious hearing defects and 18
had vision defects.

"In addition, the psychologisis
found the following facts about thc
drivers: anti-social in three in-
stances: immature in 14: overly ex-
citable in 26; unreliable in 28; ego-
('cnli'ic in 31; not. normally alert in
41; inferior iiiIcllitn-ncc in 42; little
sense of responsibility in 4:3: alco—
holic in Alli: ovcrly suggestiblc in 48:

While Driving

age should be the world’s best driv-
crs. You are young, strong and have
keen. active minds. By actual tests
your eye-hand coordination as a
group rates first.”

"But, unfortunately, being young
means other things too. It means
that you're naturally cocksure, ov-
er-conﬁdcnt, and don’t care a, hang
about danger. It means that you
take chances and speed into tight
spots from which even your better-
than-average ability cannot always
save. you."

The, campaign has emphasized
the fact that people do not always
drive the same way as they did the
day they took their drivers test.
Many students will be behind the
wheel for the first time since Sep—
teinbcr, and will naturally be a lit-
tle rusty. Others will be trying to
make an impression on someone
and will take that extra little
chance that could be the last one.

The Campaign material pointed
out in conclusion: Drive as if your
life depended on it—it docs.
