Waa- Jan

’ly PAT JAI

WAA Council held its ﬁrst open
meeting Tuesday afternoon. This
meeting was called so that winter
captains could present their sched-
ules and ask for suggestions.

Basketball captains presented
plans for having two leagues chosen
at random to play. After winners
of these are decided two new
leagues will be formed. Two winners
from each of these leagues will play
for the cup. It was suggested each
of these leagues will play for the
cup and that a list of referees be
posted so that the teams will know
who they are.

Bowling System Set

A new system for the bowling
club has been worked out. Only
two games will be bowled and one
point will be awarded to the winner
of each game. Ofﬁcial days are
Monday and Thursday from 3:30
to 5 pm. Each team will consist of
ﬁve players and will roll once a
week. There are to be no elimina-
tions and the winner is chosen on a
percentage basis. Edythe Kelleher
'50 and Audrey Weller '51 are cap-
tains.

Swimming Thursday Night

The Jewish Health Center will
be open on Thursday nights for
swimming until February. After
February Lifesaving will be held at
the same time. Credit for these
clubs will be given on a percentage
basis of the number of practices
held.

Several suggestions were made
for Winter Sports with Ken
Thompson ’50. as captain. Two new
sets of sklis have been purchased
by WAA and they can be borrowed
for a weekend or any time during
the Week. Skating parties will be
planned to go to Cohoes where
there are good facilities. Washing-
ton Park can also be used.

Ping Pong Planned

A ping-pong tournament has been
arranged by Lucy Lytle and Mary
Lou RLed. captains. The ﬁrst two
rounds must be played off by
Christmas. When the singles cham-
pion is decided a doubles tourna-
ment will be played. Later it is
hoped to arrange a mixed doubles
tournament with MAA.

During the meeting, copies of the
WAA constitution were passed out
to those girls attending the meet-
ing. One will be posted on the bul-
letin board for anyone else who is
interested.

Holliday Heads Football

At a meeting of this year's foot-
ball captains Al Holliday was elect-
ed next year's manager for the In-
tramural Football program. The
play-off game between KB and Pot-
ter was also discussed.

It was decided that if at all pos-
sible the game should be played,
but due to many conflicting factors
no date for the game has been de-
cided upon as yet. Rain has caused
the postpOnement of the game and
darkness and the baskctball season
are two of the obstacles to be over-
come.

Farley Standout
For State Team

The battle for ﬁrst place in the
Intercollegiate Bowling league be-
gan anew Wednesday night at the
Playdium after a Week’s lay-off.
The statesmen started things off
with a bang by sweeping three
games from the Law School and
rolling into ﬁrst place.

Siena Defeated

Siena, State’s number one rival
for the top berth, dropped into sec-
ond place due to a 2 to 1 defeat at
the hands of the Pharmacy Squad.
This same Pharmacy ﬁve knocked
the State quintet out of ﬁrst place
four weeks ago. State's three-game
victory and Siena’s loss enabled the
statesmen to go in a one-game
lead.

For individual honors, Hank Far-
ley with a mighty 220 and a three-
game total of 526 was high man
for the varsity. Don McDonald was
runnerup with 486.

Four Teams Tied
For FirsiL Place
in Pin League

 

WAA Cagers
Form 16 Teams

Elly Adams, Ruth Smith, Juniors,
and Phyllis Harris ’51, basketball
captains, have announced plans for
the season. This year there are six-
teen teams in the leagues and the
scheduled games begin on Decem-
ber 11.

Two leagues of 8 teams each will
play during the ﬁrst half of the sea-
son. These teams will be picked at
random. When these games are
completed, the teams will be lined
up in each league according to the
number of games they have won.
Then two new leagues will be form-
ed of teams number 1, 2, 5, and 6
from the ﬁrst league, and teams 3,
4. 7. and 8 from the second league,
in League A; and the remaining
teams will be placed in League B.
These leagues will play and then
the two top teams in each will play
off for the basketball cup.

N0 Eliminations

There will be no eliminations this
year so all the teams will be able
to play a full schedule of games.
A team is to have at least five play-
ers on the ﬂoor and one scorer
within ﬁve minutes of the assigned
time. The game must be forfeited
if there is not a full team.

Team Lists Due Today

All lists of teams must be hand-
ed to one of the basketball captains
today. Any girl who starts on one
team at the beginning of the sea-
son is not allowed to play on any
other team.

Scheduled games will be played
Tuesday and Wednesday nights
and on Saturday morning. General
practices will be held on Monday
afternoon and at other times. Def-
inite information as to when these
practices are to be held will be
posted on the WAA bulletin board.

,By PAUL BUCHMAN

ALL US PEOPLE: Did you ever
play basketball in high school, Mr.
O’Brien?

TOM O'BRIEN: Yes .
well . . .

US: You have quite a reputation
as a writer, Mr. O’Brien. Just what
type of literature do you write?

O’BRIEN: (Blushing) Aw-w-w-

..Iuh...

W . . .

US: Mr. O’Brien, you‘re a sterling
basketball player, and you consist—
ently score in double figures. To
what do you attribute your success?

O'BRIEN: (Slightly redder) Oh,
I'm not that good . . . you see . . .
well,

It ﬁt it

“0'Bie.” I soon discovered, is a
little bit modest. His friends,
though, weren't so short on words,
and praised him to the skies. Some
quotes:

“‘O’Bie‘ is one of our standout
‘ham-and-eggers.’ He‘s also a char-
ter member of the club.”

“When he went to high school he
was one of the best players on the
basketball team: literally a star!"

Born In Albany

Tom is lucky enough to be a na-
tive of this area. He was born in
Albany, and Went to Van Renssel-
aer High School. While there he
starred in Basketball. Bast-ball,Soc-
cer, was elected presidcni of the
Sophomore Class. and was editor-
in-chief 01' the “Oracle,” school lit-
eiary magazine. He Went into the
Navy soon after graduation in 1944.

“I went to boot at Sampson, and
then to quartermastcr school atthe
Gulfport N.T.S. 1 made the basket-
ball team there, but the other guys
were so good that the only thing I
did was to blow up the basketballs
once in a while."

“Then.” I asked. “you used to dish
out wrong sized uniforms over the
counter?"

"NO! NO! NO!“ he shouted. “A
(piartrrinabtcr in the Navy isn‘t the
same as in the Army. I learned
Navigation and signalling: and
worked on the ship‘s bridge."

Well. you learn something
every day.

Discharged in the spring of 1946,
Tom came to State the following
September, spending thc summer
doing, as he called it, “absolutely

He has been on the starting var-
sity five ever since he came. and
this year will probably be one of
the outstanding players on the
trim, due to his uxpcricncc.
