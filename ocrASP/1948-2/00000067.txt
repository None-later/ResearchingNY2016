DeGormo Judges Potatoes,
Compefes ln National Contest

Farmers are not the only ones
to judge potatoes. Students do
it. too. In fact. one of State's
students is quite superior at it.
Lindley DcGarmo '50, came out
first in last year's contest for
prize potato judgers. and fifth
in this year's contest.

He doesn't just judge spuds.
though. He can actually tell you,
just from glancing at the eyes
(of the potato. that is) whether
that particular apple of the
ground is a sharp Long Islander,
or whether it is native Califor—
niall.

DcGarmo is connected with
the vegetable department of the
4-H club, ijou know, heat,
hunger. horror. ai.d hollandaiscl.
That's where he got his learn-
ing.

DcGarmo is now taking part
in a national contest for judg-
ing vegetables in Detroit. Mich—

competing in the contest rcp—
rescnting New York State.

ed in a theme fitting to the season
of the year. Everson Kinn ’49,
Chairman of the Decoration Com-
mittee, has made plans for decora-
tions for the effect of a snowy
Christmas.

Open To All Students

Miss Cook and Zeller wish to re-
mind students that the ball is not
restricted to sorority and fraternity
members. Any student and his guest
may attend. They also wish to ex-
plain the prcsentation of a smaller

orchestra was hired and the Christ-
mas Ball was held in a large place.
However, Inter—Fraternity - Inter-
Sorority Council lost money because
attendance was not large enough.
This year the Council wishes to
present a smaller dance and hopes
to remain financially in the black.

Tickets are still on sale at the
booth at the door of the Commons.
Persons attending the ball will be
able to purchase tickets at the door
for $3.00 per bid.
