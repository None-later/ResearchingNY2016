TheCGr‘e’ek Situation

Criticismro'f both the fraternities and sororities
in general and of their intolerance and rushing
systems in particular has been steadily increasing.

It would seem that certain groups are receiving
undue‘criticism-for' an existing situation which is
certainly no fault of theirs. The restricted mem-
bership policies in effect today were originated
about twenty years ago when State College was
not the progressive, tolerant college it is today.
Because of the discrimination at that time, fra-
ternities and sororities were organized in direct
opposition to each other. The active chapters are
aware of the changes in attitude since that time
and have endeavored to remedy the situation. They
have not found it easy, however, to convince the
original founders, who, in many cases, are the most
active alumni, that things are not the the same
and that times necessitate a change. Representa-
tives from local chapters of national fraternities
have appeared at the national conventions to ﬁght
for the removal of the discrimination clause but,
to date, they have not been successful.

The important thing is that the active members
are trying to make the change but the change, of
necessity, will be gradual.

Interfraternity Council plans to have a meeting
in the very near future to discuss the insertion of
a. clause, concerning the postponement of bidding,
in the Inter-fraternity Council constitution. If the
plan goes through, and there is every indication
that it will, freshmen men will not receive bids
until sometime before spring recess.

If the sororities will follow the lead, State Col-
lege will be well rid of the intensiﬁed rushing sys-
tem. The crowded schedules of the students of this
college will not permit constant rushing from Sep-
tember to March and by prolonging it, the rushing
will be gradual and better for all concerned. So-
rority women and freshmen will be given the op-
portunity to really KNOW each other instead of
being forced to judge on a false basis which has
been the case in the past.

Let’s face it! The situation has needed to be
remedied for a long time. Action is in order!

A Reminder . . .

Last week in assembly, a plea was made for
Christmas presents for the children at the Albany
Home. Cartons were placed in the corridors by the
members of Myskania and the various age groups
were published in last week‘s NEWS,

Less than one week remains before the party at
the home and the cartons are far from overflowing.
We're not asking the impossible this time.
Fifteen minutes of your time and fifty cents of
your money is very little when it is measured in
terms of the bang those kids get out of opening
your presents.

And if you'd like to get a little of the Yuletide
spirit before attending the (‘hristmas parties at
the group houses, come to the party and see for
yourself.

STATE COLLEGE NEWI. FRIDAY. DECEMBER 10. 1048

Last Tuesday being the seventh
anniversary of Pearl Harbor, it was
ﬁtting that the dramatic presenta-
tion for the evening should include
a war tragedy. Perhaps even more
appropriate was the audience reac-
tion to this tragedy. The student
body had considerable difﬁculty in
realizing that the play was a trag-
edy, and having realized it, they
were rather loathe to admit the
fact. The fault does not lie com-
pletely on the shoulders of our 11-
literate, however; the cast con-
tributed to the initial confusion.
Both Joe Keefe as a tough (I) G.I.,
and Martin Bush as the Captain
were unconvincing. Joe outshouted
the mildest Sergeant I have seen
outside 5-1, but I was left with the
conviction that they had both been
politely raised in a cultured atmo-
sphere. This is nice to know but
added nothing to the reality of the
drama. Let it be said that when
the audience was put in the mood
'by the better performances. the

production went amazingly well.
The entire supporting cast was ex-
cellent but special bows go to Mmes.
Lyons and Noonan for their prop
and set work, to Joe Purdy, Ellen
Fay, Tink Whitpen and Dan Rider
for excellent performances, and to
Joe Cruciila for the authentic cos-
turning.

The second production, a light
(almost nebulous) farce, was taken
to the audience‘s heart like a suckl-
ing baby. The redeeming factor in
an otherwise dull fare was Dick
Clemen’s performance as the hus-
band. Also, the girls were attrac-
tively dressed.

A brief word on the intermission
entertainment. Battling an impo-
lite audience, a clunking helmet
liner, someone hammering back-
stage, and a bad cold. Joe Crucilia,
accompanied by Pinky Smith, re-
galed us with four ﬁne tenor num-
bers. I hope we can expect more of
same in the near future.

 

 

 

Our contemporary, Soapbox, pub-
lished in this week’s issue an art-
icle entitled “AMA vs. Federal
Health Insurance Program." The
evidence used to back up the con—
clusions is an example of crass use
of statistics without showing what
statistics really mean. Take for ex-
ample, the fact that “75% of Amer—
ican Males are being turned down
by post-war draft boards.” Does this
mean that 75% of our men are un—
healthy? Why. it. only means that
World War II 4F’s are being called
up for rejection. Then We are told
that a 4% reduction from payrolls
will pay all costs of medical serv-
ice for workers. And does the 4%
come out of thin air? It will merely
be added to prices causing even
higher prices.

This author goes on to interpret
the Ewing Plan to be administered
by local committees of doctors and
“administrators"—-in other words,
politics and medicine. The case of
John Doe who can pick his personal
physician for illness is described.
but are we assured that Mr. Doe's
physician has enough political i11-
ilucnce to be on the local panel of
doctors? If you want more informa—
tion about panels of doctors, ask
your physician about Workmen's
Compensation racket in this and
other states.

Agreed that. medical service can
be improved (as can most other
thingsl. The government can (lis-
chnrgc its obligation to provide bet-
ter medical service at lower cost 111
the following ways—none of which
permit. the politician to tell the
doctor whom and 110w to treat:

1. Government subsidy of medi-
cal research.

2. Government subsidy of hospi-
tals»thcre's an acute shortage.

3. Government scholarships for
medical training with the provision

that recipients must practice for a.
length of time in areas which lack
sufﬁcient medical care.

4. Government subsidy of medi-
cal colleges.

The AMA. has tried successfully
a plan of mass health insurance 111
Michigan. The workers pay the
premium by payroll deduction and
receive medical care for selves and
family in return for this payment—
not for free! The government acts as
the insurance company or under-
writer and adjusts premiums to suit
actual costs of the program so that;
each person pays for his share of
medical attention.

The author of the Soapbox article
bases his enthusiasm for the Ewing
Plan on the fact that the AMA.
is opposing it. College level think-
ing can do a better job than judg-
ing a proposal by its enemies!

To the Editor:

“Campus heartache'bwycs, that's
a name that has been given to the
sorority. No one but one of those
who hasn't “made it." has any c011-
ccption of how it feels.

As it is true with many who come
to State, we had no experience with
sororities. We are not the type of
people who put on an act. so we just
went along our own way.

Naturally, We were bewildered
and shy. Gradually. we became ac-
climated to the college system.
Then. we noticed a peculiar phe-
nomena—other girls were being
asked to lunch—the mailboxes were
full.

Day after day we want. down to
the mailbox, hopefully, but. we al-
ways came away empty-handed.

After a time. we gaVc up looking.
It was apparently no use. Already,
some girls were being dropped.

Some, of course. are definite iride-

Then. we found that. we Were iii-

other. This confuses us.

The Common-Stator is given the widest latitude as
author of this column, although hia viewpoints do
not necessarily reflect those of the STATI COLLIOI
News.

COOPERATION NEEDED

Mr. Fulvio, tr: college treasurer, gave us the info
on the cafeteria plan. The NEWS covered the follow-
ing highlights back in September but for those who
missed them, here they are:

1. Any profits would be returned to the subscribers
in any way that they voted to distribute them. Divi-
dends. better food, etc.

2. The manager would be 011 a ﬂat salary basis.
No commission or proﬁts deal.

3. Administration and policy would be determined
by a. council composed of student subscribers with
faculty advisors.

4. It would be on a ﬁve day a week basis at $100
per semester. This is the best estimate that could be
set until the plan was operating.

It is strictly for the beneﬁt of the students but the
administration must have an adequate student sub-
scription before it can sign contracts, hire help, etc.
A full semester subscription is necessary because stu-
dents dropping out half way thru the program would
upset it. The administration will meet us half way
but the students will decide the outcome.

HOT ROCK IDEA

Can a deal be worked with one of the merchants
associations to give discounts on purchases with the
presentation of a student Tax card? It has worked
elsewhere.

SCHOOL SPIRIT

The basketball players appreciated the swell turn-
out for their first games but they were embarrassed
by the spectator reaction to the temper flare-ups
among the visiting players. State players will tell you
that; it can happen to anyone in the heat of a game
and they felt that the booing, especially during the
foul shots. was not sportsmanlike.

WIIA’ IIOI’PENED

. to the committee composed of Juniors and
faculty members to investigate the possibility of
working with the children's groups . . . with credit hours
given for such work? The student committee mem-
bers are still interested, the opportunities for such
work in Albany is plentiful, and the newly formed
All State Community Service has initiated the basic
groundwork. Support from our education department
is still lacking. Guess that it's easier to theorize in
lectures.
’I‘IIE IMPORTANT ISSUE

If you don't think that the frat-sorority question
is an important one, make sure you read this week‘s
Letter to the Editor. There are three solutions; re-
move the organizations from campus. form new or-
gamzations. or increase the present membership. The
human desire for organization make the ﬁrst 1111-
practical. New organizations would probably increase
the present financial problems. The third looks best.
More people would be taken care of. thereby decreas-
ing the “left out" hurt and it. would bolster the weak-
ened finances that the sororities in particular are
now feeling.

That frat and sorority members are aware of the
defects is shown in this week's editorial and Mike
Capuano's letter of last week. More active individual
interest will help clear up the question and benefit
the entire school. 011 the other hand . . .

. the sororities deserve a pat on the back for
their buffet suppers and formal dinners. These af-
fairs, that end tl'ic much criticized rushing period.
are indications of the cooperation and enjoyment that.
sororities can provide.

Merry Christmas and we‘ll see you all next year.

“Buildings are being made of
strange materials everywhere to-
day, but the beaverboards with
which Americans are becoming ac—
quainted seems like pre-war luxury
in comparison to the Hatzllkyriakon
Refugee Center here, where walls
are made of blankets and rugs."

The above quote was taken from
a release from the World Student
Service road and pertains to the
conditions under which students in
Athens, Greece find themselves liv-
ing. WSSF is supported by contri-
butions from the student bodies of
American Colleges and was one of
the services included under the
Campus Chest Drive, here.

The article goes 011 to say that
before the war, Hatzilkyriakon was
an orphanage— a large building
With long open dormitories tor the
children. Now converted into a
center for Greek refugees from
countries to the North, a shortage
of building materials has made it
impossible to partition off indivi-
dual rooms or living quarters for
families. In place of anything more
substantial, family units have made
private quarters for themselves by
hanging blankets and rugs in such
a l’ity that they form little square
cubicles. Inside these rooms. entire
families oat, sleep and manage to
do some cooking.

Hatzykrinkon. which houses most
of the refugee students from other
Balkan countries, has separate pro—
visions for single men and women,
who are housed in tents behind the
main building. Many of the students
there, since they tied with their
families. live in the “Woolen—walled"
rooms of the main building. 110w—
ever.

Thc center has a large central
kitchen. but no (iihlltg hall. The.
people living in the center go to
the kitchen each din to draw their
rations, and then return to their
own quarters to eat it. Only one
meal a day is served. and the food
is poor. 011 special holidays 11 little
meat. may be included in the ra-
