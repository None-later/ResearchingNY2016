Wea- 9400

____._By MICKEY SEAMAN

To date there have been exactly
six couples who have done their
part with regard to the ping pong
tourney. As yet there are still eight
rounds to be played before the ac-
tual play-offs can begin. We hope
these girls realize that all of the
ﬁrst round matches must be ﬂn-
ished before vacation or these play-
ers will be eliminated. Let's get
busy on this, kids, and see if all of
the second round can't be com-
pleted before vacation.

 

The fencing team is off to a good
start. Twenty-four girls, and very
enthusiastic ones, too, are giving up
their time to try their skill at this
sport. Practice is held every Sat.‘
from one to two in the Milne gym.
The instructor, who was formerly
a member of the La Salle fencing
team, is Gerry Firth, ’52.

As usual. WAA is looking ahead.
They are making plans for another
open meeting in the near future
so that plans can be made for the
proposed conference at State next
year and suggestions offered re-
garding winter sports. Watch the
WAA Bulletin Board for the date
of this meeting and come to air
your grievances there.

Which is the most attractive hul—
letin board in lower Draper? WAA‘s.
of course! Congratulations on such
an attractive set tip. It certainly
makes us stop—and look!

WAA Begins
Basketball Season

WAA basketball league games
will get underway on Saturday
morning in Page gym at ten o'clock.
The next scheduled game will be
played on Tuesday and Wednesday
nights. starting at seven o‘clock.

Keglers Top Pharmacy,
Open Lead Over Siena

 

State Drops Opener;
Defeats Willimantic

Making a brilliant comeback,
State's Varsity basketball team al-
most pulled a startling upset over
N.Y.S. Marltiine Academy last Fri-
day night. The cagers proved it was
not a “hotnlght” by taking Wil-
limantic State Teachers on Satur-
day night.

Trailing by the count of 22-6 in
the first period, State look-ed like a
beaten team, but then the Peds'
offense began to click and with
Tom O’Brien leading a second pe-
riod spurge, State came within hail-
ing distance of Maritime. The sec—
ond half opened with a “new”
State team, led by Sy Fersh, slowly
shortening the lead. A see-saw bat-
ti-e during the fourth quarter saw
State come within one point of the
victors only to have several breaks
go against them. The filial count
was 58-53 in favor of the visitors
who were paced by red-headed
Coogan and Jerry Timony.

Proving that they can fight hard,
the statesmen came back Saturday
night to take Willimantic in tow,
34-46. Although the score shows a
close game, State had no trouble
in gaining their first win of the
young season. After a close first
half, St.it.- slowly pulled away uti-
til they llilCl a comfortable margin
of 14 ponits. Seeing the game was
well Ill hand, Coach Hathaway
started to empty the bench to give
the second stringers a chance to
see what they could do. For the
second night in a row, Fcrsli led
liis team in scoring although Ed
Mattlicws gave the crowd a thrill-
inw timc at thc close of the first
half by ptitting on a scoring spree
01 nine points including several

cautiitil shots. ,

Mullin's High 3
Clinches Victory

McDonald Hits Season's
High Game With 233

Opening Wednesday night’s match
with a. tremendous 1003 game, the
Varsity Bowling squad went on to
sweep the three-game set from Al-
bany Pharmacy. In recent weeks,
the Pharmacists have been a rath-
er troublesome crew due to their
ability to knock off the top teams.
But the statesmen safeguarded
their first place margin by taking
an early lead and were never head-
ed. In fact, State now holds a three
game lead over second place Siena,
because the lads from Loudonville
dropped two decisions out of three
to A.B.C.

Iii compiling that 1003 single
game. some outstanding individual
performances were recorded. Don
McDonald's 233 and D12 Dickinson’s
220 wci'c the big guns of the State
attack. Fran Miillin put together
games of 199. 188, and 189 for a
total of 576 to lead in that depart-
ment. Also in the 500 bracket were
McDonald with 557 and Dickinson
with 537.

The Varsity will roll against
A.B.C. in their last match before
vacation. The match is scheduled
for Wednesday night at nine at the
Playdiuiii.

"Slate The Best”
Soy Delegates

Three tired but thoroughly satis-
fied delegates returned to Albany
from Syracuse after spending last
Week-end at the annual conference
of the New York State Woman’s
Athletic Association. Say Adams,
Matteson, and Smith, State’s rep-
resentatives, “In comparison with
the other colleges, our own WAA
has a much better program and
more participation and interest."

This year’s delegation marked
State College’s ﬁrst year of partici-
pation in the organization in which
some thirty New York State col-
leges hold membership. Although
plans have not yet been conﬁrmed,
it is hoped that the conference can
be held at Albany next year.

Our delegates enthusiastically re-
port that the woman’s athletic pro-
ram here compared favorably with
the majority of other colleges and
that, in most cases, ours offers more
varied and better organized activi-
ties. The state group led discussion
on the organization of intramural
sports.

In a speech given by the Vassar
Director of Physical Education, ﬁve
points Were listed as included in
the Association program: the so-
cial and psychological importance
of athletics, the continuance of ath-
letics beyond college life, need for
athletics for people of all ages,
maintenance of high sportsmanship
standards through sports, and the
maintenance of standards set up
by the National Athletic Federa-
tion.

New ideas on administrative
problems, on organization and
awards were found by the delegates
who hope to incorporate these into
State‘s Woman's Athletic program.

From all appearances, State’s

WAA Keglers
Get Underway

The initial games in the WAA
Bowling League were rolled on
Monday and Thursday afternoons
on the Rice Alleys. Matches will
continue on these days throughout
the winter season.

According to Edythe Kelleher and
Audrey Weller, Bowling captains,
each team in the league will bowl
two games in each match with one
point awarded for each game. Mon-
day's opener found Pierce Hall and
Gamma Kappa in the lead by tak-
ing two games from Beta Zeta and
Chi Sig respectively. Sayles Hall
and Phi Delta split, each winning
one point.

Team high was rolled by Gamma
Kappa, hitting 560 in both games.

Lee Cheatham, bowling for the
Sayles Hall team, was high bowler
for the day averaging 140.5. Joan
Keyton, of the Chi Sig team, aver-
aged second high with 136.

Next Week’s schedule ﬁnds Chi
Sig bowling A. E. Phi, Gamma Kap-
pa against Wren, and Sayles with
Pierce on Monday, while Thursday‘s
matches include Beta Zeta vs. New—
man, Kappa Delta vs. Psi Gamma,
and Phi Delta vs. the fresh.

Team scores:

participation in this organization
should lead to the long overdue iii-
terest in athletics beyond the nar-
row scope of one school, and should
go a long way toward bringing c.0—
ed athletics into the inter-colleg-
iate realm.
