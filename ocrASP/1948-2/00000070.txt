Hurry,'Buy Your Bid Today
For The Christmas Blowout

Hurry . . . Hurry . . . Hurry!
This is your last chance to go
to the Christmas Formal and
perhaps to get a date. If you
can‘t get a girl (or fellow, as
the case may be) why, Just ask
the first person you bump into
today. Don’t bump too hard or
they may not trust you on a
dance floor. If they say “NO”
then ask the second person.
What’s the matter, are you
proud?

Don’t be so grossly schmo-ish
as to say that you can’t dance.
Anybody can. Or at least every-
body makes a poor attempt. If
you‘re too weary after a, long
week of classroom drudgery,
you can always find a quiet cor-
ner to nap in. You don’t have
to stay long, anyway.

What! You don’t have three
dollars? That’s silly—everyone
has three dollars at some tinie
during their lives, and now hap-
pens to be the time.

And you‘re so lucky! There
just happens to be a few bids
left, and they saved them for
you alone.
