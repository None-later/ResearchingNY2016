3M4 0" 5W -’ -’ 1 Comedy Will Highlight

Repeat performances can be enjoyable if the action involved is
exceptional or pleasing to the audience but they can also be UNenjoy-
able when forcibly placed before an audience—the audience in this
case being State College students and faculty. The performance to
which this refers is the inconsiderate manner in which the examination
schedule seems to have been arranged.

Petitions have been circulating throughout the school this week.
The students are dissatisfied, the faculty is dissatisﬁed- and this dis-
satisfaction with exam schedules has been rapidly increasing since
1946. At this time exams were crowded regardless of the mad rush
between semesters. Mathematically speaking, there is great accom-
plishment in a short time but not half as great accomplishment as
there could be with a little more time.

As the situation stands at present, exams will be held from
Thursday, January 27, until Saturday, February 5. On the following
Monday, February 7, second semester classes begin. Let us examine
carefully the results of this situation.

1. No time is scheduled for conflict exams.

If the administra-

tion does not wish to hold conflict exams, why not really enforce the
catalogue ruling that no student may take two courses in the same
examination group during the same semester?

2. Second semester Milne and off-campus practice teachers will
be involved in preparatory conferences with their supervisors plus

L‘XillllS.

J. Borderline students must begin second semester classes with-
out knowing the results of their first semester courses.

4. Faculty members will not have sufficient time to correct papers
or determine marks for the registrar's office.

5. The Registrar's office will be swamped with the recording of
grades and second semester registration.

0. Janitorial staff members receive no overtime pay and Would

have to Work overtime to get the

chairs ready for the exam period.

This is an extensive job which most frequently goes without any

realization.

As a solution to this mess and confusion. may it be suggested
that this year and in years to come the mid-year examinations begin
on a Monday anti second semester classes begin two weeks from that.
Monday. This plan would still not give as much time as other col-
icgcs receive but would at least give a few days as a breathing spell.

Revising the schedule this ycar is the immediate problem. Why
not begin exams. Monday. january 24. and solve all of the problems
listed above? l’etitions are now in the office of administrationwtbc
problem has been brought to the attention of as many as it was pos-
sible to reach. i’crhaps this too will die in the hand of the authorities
but it certainly represents a great deal of disscnsion anti dissatisfac-

tion on the part of all concerned.
