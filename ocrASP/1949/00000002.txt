A '-I

By MULLIGAN

A city like New York with the largest municipal
budget in the world devotes a considerable sum to
the establishment and care of numerous museums
. . .‘intended for the education of its citizenry. It
maintains a standing art commission of big-game
specialists to regulate and encourage the “cultura-
tien” of the New Yorker. Surely somewhere in the
soul of the rural citizen, as well as in that of the city,
there exists a reassuring knowledge that he is the
part-owner of various great originals hanging in
the halls of the Metropolitan: Actually his contact
with,art is negligible. ‘w -

In this “museumized” scheme of things, art has
become at best a Saturday thing—lifted out of
the every-day experience of the citizen~and iso-
lated within a rather solid and foreboding clolster.
In New York “Art” reigns self-righteously on a
certain block of Central Park, it lights for another
moment on 53rd Street and again inoffensively. on
8th Street. In Albany, it occupies a singularly sa-
cred position between the Albany Academy for Girls
and the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to
Animals. ‘ '

Actually the average American doesn't live on
Central Park or lower Western Avenue. He works
in the Washington Market or General Analine or
for the “State.” He studies at a teachers' col-
lege. He spends one per cent of each day on sub-
ways or United Traction vehicles and his Saturdays
are devoted to lawn-mowing. baby-sitting, or court—
ing His contact with form and color consist of the
tan and darker tan of ofﬁce interiors. a rather gro-
tesque Draper Hall "Minerva" and a series of color-
ful Maidenform ads on the B.M.T. When his cultur-
al soul is hungry beyond endurance he steals an
hour or two to replenish it in an intense vitamin-
capsule vietuai. The new Art—born of the Borinage
and the evei-yman—rhas escaped the courts of the
Medici and jumped into its sanctuary ithe American
Art Gallery.

How—in such a segmented, classiﬁed system—-—can
Americans ever be more than a nation of dilettante
valves or a nation of complete, artistic sterility? ‘

During the century we have developed extensive
state or municipal systems of public libraries: Music,
and recording libraries. sickI-room appliances li-
brariesand even toy libraries. The only element we
have refused for circulation is-«Art. Why can‘t at
least part of the state or municipal art fund and
endowment be used to "expose" the citizenry to the
art that is its cultural birthright? Through branch
ofﬁces of the Museum, located perhaps in public
librarieswprints and plaster cast could be circulated
fox stipulated periods through: ‘

The city might even rent one or two United 'l‘rac-

Actually a city like New York would have no prob-
Icm of complex budgetary readjustment it would on-
ly mean cutting down onthc detail of standing cx-
hibits and museum personnel. sacrificing art accum-
ulation to art circulation. A town of limited muni-
cipul art funds might be able to integrate a program
with its libraries and get benefit from their nllot-
nicnt. Eventually one could hope for a state system

State Frat Gains New-Home

 

The rest 0f us had two weeks va-
cation for the holidays but this cer-
tainly wasn‘t the case with the SLS
men who returned to college four
and five days early to get their new
home ready. Yes. it was the first
time since the beginning of the
war. but it was worth it.

Sixty-two Willett Street was
buzzing with activity . . . within a
matter of a few days before the
holidays. SLS had located their
house. consulted the administra-
tion. and had taken their furniture
back from Saylcs Hall Annex where
it had been since the beginning of
the war. The Annex was then be-
reft of belongings but the SL8 men
were happy. .

There are three floors with the
kitchen and study room on the
ﬁrst floor. Twenty-eight men are to
be accommodated in the new house.
Some of the rooms are so large
that eight men can be accommo-
dated comfortably. ~

The fraternity was very lucky

STUDENT AFFAIRS

Last Monday the resignations of Joy Simon and
Don Langsley froom Myskania became official. We're
told that their reasons had to do with individual
principles. That may be so, but the idea of conflict-
ing personalities sounds more likely. It would be
interesting to see the reactions of student body if
the arguments at the three or four Myskania meet-
ings prior to vacation were made known. The policy
of “keeping things quiet" might have been wise for
a time. Two members have already resigned and
others have become discouraged with the set—up.
Maybe some sincere resolutions on the part of all
concerned will remedy the situation.

even include such a function under the student tux.

“Happy Journey to Camden” is a
comedy concerned with down-to-
earth. wholesome family life; its
troubles and joys. complete with
marbles and jalopies. The players
are Jacqueline Mann ’51, Ma; Fred-

Arthur; Jane Cook ‘51, Beulah; and
Thomas Lisker ’49, Stage Manager.

“Feast of the Ortolans" is a
drama showing a cross-cut of the
character of the French aristocracy
just prior to the historic storming
of the Bastille. The cast includes

docs not envision any such tottering

cr. it leaves to the local areas con-

Passing to another objection to
the Compulsory Insurance Plan:
that it will further augment the in-
flationary spiral. the obvious answer
is to the contrariwisc: the money
collected for the proposed Health
Program is actually dctoured from
the main consumption stream into
a Dci‘lationary Insurance fund.

mature nature. considering the
