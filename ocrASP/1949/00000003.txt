MAA' C‘agersl ‘l "Fates;I  r ‘ Beavers Leading

Begin Schedule

Three teams had to come from

.behind in the opening night of

men‘s lntra-mural basketball, Mon-
day, January 3rd, but with each
victory easier than the one before.
The Finks trailed the Carpetbaggers
until the last three minutes of a
fast game. In the second contest
Potter just came ahead by two
points at the half. The Gents were
trailing by three points at the half
but they went ahead by four points
early in the third period.

The opening game of the evening
found the Finks facing the Carpet-
baggers. The “Baggers,” with their
height: Duncombe, Yole. Lanni and
Heinze, got off to a fast start and
led the Finks‘at the end of the
quarter: 10-6. Dunc‘ombe and Clear-
water, at centers. balanced each
other; with Clearwatcr holding Dun-
combe to two field goals, at the ex-
pense of five fouls, sending him out
with three seconds left in the game.
Duncombe converted three of his
attempts into points. Heinze, of the
“Bags,” showed the way by dump-
ing in 13 counters; while the Finks
had four high scorers: Clearwater.
Moriarity, Vaughn and McLaren. all
with seven points.

The end-line mat spectators were
in for a surprise when St. Mary's
Angels led the tall. defending
champs, Potter Club. at the end of
the first quarter: 10-8. Ainlaw, new
to the Angels' team this year, stop-
ped Mullin for the first half of the
game and his guarding accounted
for the low Potter scoring in the
first half. Potter's bucket man
found the range in the third quar-
ter and paced his team to a score—
doubling quarter. Mullin was high-
scorer for the game with 14 points.
Frail, of the Angels. who sustained
the only injury of the evening, was
high for the Angels with six.

VanDcrzce could only bring out
five men. and the fact that they had
to go slow for fear of fouling out
or tiring out. gave the Gents an
edge which they took advantage of
to pile on the reserves in the second
half. Faced by Mike Rinsberg's
eight points. VanDerzcc's set shots
stayed ahead until the third stanza.
For the Gents, typically, Bullock.
off to a slow start. finally found the
range and dumped in 10 points to
spark the winners.

The three games w-erc easily spot-
ted as the first of the season, with
play fast and hectic, the ball often
booted from 0110 end of the court to
the other.

Of last year's outstanding scorers,
returning to their teams this year
Mullin was most noticeable; and of
the newcomers Heinzc of the Car-
petbaggcrs and Anilow of the Angels
looked like the best.

JV's Play Delhi
Saturday Night

This coming week State will op-
pose two teams on the road after a
two week layoff. Friday the team
travels to New Paltz to play the
Teachers’ College located there.
New Paltz is a new-comer to State’s
schedule and will provide the “Feds”
with plenty of trouble. Saturday
night State will journey to Wil-
liamantie to oppose Williamantic
State Teachers’ College of Connec-
ticut. Earlier in the season State
defeated the Connecticut school 54-
46 and the game Saturday night
is expected to be no pushover.

Coach Merlin Hathaway is sorry
to report the loss of Captain Ken-

ny George. George's drive, speed
and play-making will be sorely
missed by the team.

Varsity Drops ’Iwo

State College's Varsity Basketball
team dropped two games on the
road before the Christmas holiday.
to the New York state Maritime
Academy and then to Queens Col-
lege.

Maritime Academy surged ahead
in the first few seconds of the game
by virtue of a field goal by Coogan
and was never headed. Coogan led
his teammates in the one-sided vic-
tory over State with 29 points.
George was high for State with 9.
The final score was 67-32.

Also on the road that weekend
Queens downed the "Feds" by a 66-
42 count. The home live jumped
to an early lead and again a big
center was the chief problem which
confronted State's defense. Shering
led the home quintet with 20 points

On Road

while Brown led the Purple and
Gold 01‘ State with 10 points.

The Junior Varsity squad has
gotten off to a rough start winning
two of its five starts.

J. V.'s Face Delhi

They have beaten ABC, and Del-
hi while losing to ABC, Blanchard
Post, and Albany Pharmacy. In a
Weekend contest the J. V.'s will
journey to Delhi to oppose a strong
Delhi quintet. The following men
are members of the Junior Varsity:
Dolan, Bayer, Wander, Ryder.
Stearn, Colpoys, Englehart, Sand-
erson, Kaehn. Stevenson, Milne and
Hausner. The Jayvees are coached

_By PAUL BUCHMAN—

The “it” boy from Monticello is
pretty talented.

One of many of the “brain and
brawn guys” here at State,

“Slow Motion” Marvin Lansky oc-
cupies a unique niche in the stu-
dent body, viz.

Exhibit A: He's a member of the
starting Varsity Basketball five.

Exhibit B: As a speaker, “Mel”
is highly talented, witness his four
years on his high school debating
team.

Exhibit C: “Latherless” Lansky
(it's the heard that gets ‘em) ranks
high scholastically: he graduated
10th in his high school class, and
ranks in the upper quarter here at
State.

“Mel” lives in the Potter House.
and fraternally speaking, he is act-
ive in intramurals, football and
softball. In high school, he played
varsity baseball, basketball and ten-
nis.

Currently, he is working on a
committee that is laying the ground
work for a weekly radio program on
FM radio station WRWR, which it
is hoped. will give NYSCT some
much needed publicity.

When it was suggested that a
group of students accompany the
team in some of the nearer “away”
games, Marv was enthusiastic. “It
helps a lot to have a little group
of supporters at the game."

Commenting on playing condi-
tions, he said that he liked the
court in Page Hall, which is almost
a sixth player on our team. “We
always play our best at home. It's
probably the court. It's so small
that it generally throws the other
team off balance.

To his teamates. Lansky is quiet.
suave. They summarized it neatly:
“He doesn't talk much, but he gets
things done."
