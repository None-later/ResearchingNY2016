ALBANY. NEW YORK. FRIDAY. JANUARY 14." 1949

ewfw“ “J 71W Juniors, Sophs Schedule"

Democracy in action was demonstrated at the college this week
when as a result of the dissatisfactitm with the mid-year eamination
schedule, the administration took immediate steps to alleviate the
problems pointed out in last week’s editorial and the dissension among

the students and faculty.

According to the revised schedule, exams will begin on Wednes-
day, january 26, instead of Thursday, January 27. it was not pos-
sible to move the exam schedule back to Monday, January 24, be-
cause of the 75 class days required to be recognized as an accredited
college. However, the one day gained this semester because of ses-
sions held in October during the Lake Placid Conference when a
holiday was originally scheduled, made it possible to move exams

back one day.
