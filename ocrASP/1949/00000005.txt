THE ADMINISTRATION . . .

. . . took the wind out of our sails with its recep-
iton of last week's editorial on the exam schedule.
Many felt that there would be repercussions. We
were met half-way, however.

And we hope that the plan of informing the stu-
dent as to his course standing (satisfactory or un—
satisfactory) immediately after exams will not be
abandoned.

CHANGING TIMES

Time was when people cried if they made Mys-
kania and cried if they didn’t make it. Now the
tears don't run and neither do the nominees.

THEY SAY . . .

Capuano: In the NEWS issue of December 10 there
was an editorial on frats and sororities. The writer
agreed that action was necessary but gave a verbal
rap on the knuckles to the critics with, “. . . but the
change, of necessity, will be gradual." Last week the
editorial was devoted to a NEWS instigated project
and the summation was,  . . how many years and
how much dissension does it take to touch off any
action in this institution?" Kind of an inconsistent
policy, isn’t it?

Kloepfelz When the varsity basketball team visits
other schools they are sometimes treated to refresh-
ments after the game. Would it be possible for some
of the State organizations to institute such a policy?

GOOD NEWS

Upperclassmen will be glad to hear that Dr. Rienow
has consented to address the assembly on March
18. His topic titles alone are interesting. Last year
it was “Love Me, Love My Dogma.“ Wonder what it
will be this time?

WANTED: (MAYBE)

A parliamentarian (a Myskania member) for Stu-
dent Association meetings. The recent resignation
of the post has created a vacancy. If the majority
feel as Miss Simon who stated in her letter of resigna-
tion, “Roberts’ Rules are not God-like," then We
have no employment problem.

Miss Simon also said,  . . that almost any rule
can be twisted into another interpretation." I have
no quarrel with this but I am wondering to whom
DO we leave the interpretation?

THE MUSIC DEPARTMENT . . .

. . is the only department which ofﬁcially con-
tributes to our assembly programs. A great deal of
time and energy have gone into this week‘s program
which is sponsored by Music Council. Our thanks go
to Dr. Stokes and Mr. Peterson for the interest they
have shown and the work that they have done.

The participating students have also contributed
greatly to the program. One of the highlights will be
the Men's Glee Club whose preparation has been
supplemented by months of study at the Olendorf
Conservatory of Music.

THE GAG . . .
. . . to end all absent-minded profscsor gags . . .
“Have you forgotten to turn out . . .?"

GIVE ’EM A BREAK

The faculty members who show an interest in stu-
dent affairs 1and there isn't it plentiful supplyi
would appreciate it if the organizations would spread
out their chaperonlng duties 11 little more.

WE HEAR . . .

. . . that Coach Hathaway is going to sign up for
Dr. Gibson‘s Driver Education Course with the stress
being placed on the legal tcchnicnliiics (otherwise
known as ticketst of driving. The coach’s interest in
the course arose during the recent basketball [rips
to Long Island and New Paltz.

REMEMBER

Today’s election is important to each our of us 111
that Myskuniu is the judicial body of Student Asso-
ciation. Try to Choose wisely and remember 111111 you
DON'T have to put a number beside each name . . .

presented his play 111 a blaze of light
and a dash of dazzling color. Al-
though it took time to accustom
our eyes to the rare combinations
of light colors, we found the set to
be a very pleasant and appropriate
one; for it suggested to us a typical
Greenwich Village apartment that
any poet or other artist might own.

As for the play itself, the plot,
which is supposed to be a comical
one, contains many amusing lilies;
yet this viewer felt that the humor
of many of these lines failed to get
across to the audience. Whether
this was due to the iiiisinterprctu-
tion of the director or to the faulty
delivery of the members of the cast
is a question open to debate. Per-
sonally, we believe that it was half
a dozen of one and six of the other
in most instances.

Of the members of the cast, Ellen
Fay gave the most pleasing por—
trayal. Her performance was an
example of that rare dramatic gift
*that of being able to present to
an audience :1 flesh and blood per-
son; in short, she, was alive, not
just another person mouthing some-
one else's lines.

Not so. however, was the exhibi-
tion given by George Christy. We

By JOY SIMON

It’s a strange phenomena—~: people . . . (hurrying
forward or backward . . bearing proudly or re-
luctantly the labels that designate their beliefs.) If
one feels the need, one can always categorize—it’s
the easiest thing to do; It doesn’t talce much—a po-
litical theory—a religion—(he college one attends . . .
and that’s the category I want to talk about—4119
college I attend.

I am soon to leave State College, but with little re-
morse and no nostalgia. State was important. It was
an integral part of my development—a part that no
longer needs a college's sanctioning. It gave much,
and I took greedlly, and I am selfish enough to want
to go, now that I have taken. It is inevitable—this
feeling. I have no choice but to admit it. But I am
not me—I am a hypothetical situation—and I must,
have a new category—or at least that is the logical
solution to avoid stagnancy. But we hypothetical
situations are tired of categories and patterns—of a
society of predetermines—of prudities and mechanized
thought—we are tired of smiling compartments and
niceties, and in order to cope with them, we are dis-
covering socially appropriate phobias. We are disil-
lusioned with reallsms that are nothing but com—
pensatory pathways to personal satisfactions.

But we hypotheticalists (although tinged with the
dastardly idealism) can be practical, and we sigh and
accept the categories and the patterns—the validities
and invaliditles. for what they are to us. So we shall
build the strongest categorizations of all, in mere re—
action; and we shall strengthen them until they nul~
lify all the others into a melted nothingncss.
Category A:

Introspectorsz—We love and honor tl1e1n~—for they
are our thinkers. One cannot know the world without
ﬁrst knowing himself. Introspectors hate and love
themselves alternately. believe and disbelieve—they
are vacillators because every inch of mental expres-
sion is exaggerated beyond conception. They are
their severest critics and our most objective audience.
Category B:

PhilosophersI—They are just one step further than
the introspectors—~they are the thinkers who develop
the thought ti‘cndsmthey turn speciﬁcity into gen-
eralities—they twist the loves and hates into pictures
and they give it to the world. They have come out
of themselves and want to find others like them-
selves. They are necessarily d1‘eame1‘s——evcn the skep-
tics——for they always lean on a crutch of hope. They
are the attitude-makers and we must at least listen.
Category C:

Individualisls: They are the rational non-con—
i'ormists. the 101-Bohemian Bohemians, the iiii-chub-
licun Republicans. and the other delightful ctccterns.
Each situation requires 11 new response. They are
both iiitrospcctors and philosophers. They are not
lethargic and not appropriately. They are unhump-
ci'cd by crucltics and sadism and pumpkin munius.
They are conservatives and 1'11d11-1ils-—1111d middle men.
but would despise to be “labelled.” They are men of
conviction, rather than disiinction—mnstcrs of core—
monies rather than robots. They are always in danger
and grow in spite of it.

(‘iitcgory I):

I1itcrnatimialists:~Tlicsc are the composite of in-
irospcctors, pliilOsophors, 11nd individualisis who Ilill't‘
II‘III'IICCI that the whole is greater than the sum of its
parts. They live in a puzzle where each piece is striv-
ing to retain identity. and they are persistent in their
nttcmpt to jigsaw the pieces into congruity. Tlicir
f‘iivoritc painting is a map of the world—and they will
not settle for 11 surrealistic substitute. They know
that bloc and ycllow mukc green and wonder why the
recipe doesn't work. The} are mighty men who puru-

By CECELIA BATTISTI

As song and laughter rang
through Germania Hall, and Germ-
an chatter ﬁowed fast and furiously,
State men, strangely ressembllng the
German tavern waiters with their
long white aprons, hurried back and
forth from kitchen to buffet table
with trays carefully balanced. Now
a tray wavered precariously as the
waiter came in close contact with
a hustling student; now a sudden
peal of laughter pierced the air
from a nearby table. The room was
filled with gaiety; the air echoed
with the chatter and laughter. Sud-
denly, all sounds were drowned out
by voices rising in merry song.. Be-
tween relished bites of pumper-
nickel, ham, cheese, potato salad or
swallows of beer or soda, the stu-
dents danced.

Christmas decorations, still up,
added to the festive spirit. Ger-
mania Hall, typical of any hall that
you might ﬁnd in Germany, With
its wooden furniture. wooden floor,
decorated walls. and display of beer
mugs, was the perfect setting for
the Buravian-spirited Sisvitcsmcn.

The part was novel 111 its in-
formality and impromptu.

The audience was enthralled by
“Five American Girls In Germany,"
written and directed by Bev Huber.

There was no repressing the audi-
ence—especially Herr Meyer—when
Warren Reich‘s play, “Herr Hofer,"
satirizing Herr Meyer in the class-
room was presented. The climax of
the evening came when Herr Meyer,
accompanying himself on his guitar.
sang his song of 92 verses and re-
frain. There was a personal. verse
honoring each of his students, with
the 92 joining in on each refrain.

Guests of the evening were Dr.
Fuerst of Siena college and his
wife.

The turnout at Germania Hall
was more than anyone even could
hope, Ursula Neuhaus. chairman,
has said. At least 115 students at-
tended—admission being $1 per
person. Indeed so successful was
this feast, and so enthused were
the students that tentative plans
for another party in May are al-
ready being made.
