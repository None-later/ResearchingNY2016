This Bob Brown isn’t much dif-
ferent from any of the other play-
ers on the team. Hails from Pulas—
ki, New York; a typical town; and
a very busy background. Besides
graduating as Salutatioran of his
class, he ran the gamut of offi-
cialdom: Class President, Treas-
urer, Student Council, Student As-
sociation, Yearbook Business Man-
ager, even SPORTS STAFF on the
school newspaper. the “What-Not".
High School Athlete

Now then, what does he shine at
doing? Athletics, of course. In his
high school days, he played Var-
sity Baseball, Basketball. and Foot-
ball, (where an unfortunate acci-
dent to his knee nearly ended his
athletic career. So far at State it
has only necessitated his leaving
one game. the Willimantic contest
last Saturday). He was an outstand-
ing member of the Varsity Club, an
exclusive organization open only to
men who won their Varsity Sport
letter.

How about a humorous angle?
Bob Brown, (Campus Commission
try-out) is official Wednesday Com-
mons Machine Filler-Upper,

Back to high school days. Bob
was the Pulaski representative to

at Colgate University.
