room teachers are increasing far
above the 27 to 28 ﬁgures set by the
Division of Elementary Education.

Educators are concerned over the
shortage of qualiﬁed teachers. They
state that we are now entering the
fourth year since the end of World
War II and during this period the
teacher shortage has become. if
anything. more acute. New York
State has raised its expenditures
from $465 million to $495 million in
the past year. which is a large in-
crease compared with Alabama
where 300.000 children will report-
edly be without adequate schooling.
New York States’ enrollment in-
crease within the past year has been
some 27,000 pupils to educate with
the expenditure increase which
shows some improvement.

New York's education system re-
mains relatively well off compared

tlvities.
