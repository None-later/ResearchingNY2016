Dissatisfaction seems to have been the key word
for descriptions of activities at this college during
the past semester. Major gripes have come from
students complaining about the lethargy—not only
of theistudents holding political ofﬁces but of the
backwardness of the form of student government.

These gripes have not all been ill-founded and
the results of their loudness have been felt. A
Constitutional Revision Committee was appoint-
ed several weeks ago to investigate the con-
stitution and to report back to Council. This was
done Wednesday night, with the result that the
committee omitted discussing what should be done
to revise our Constitution as it is at the present
time, but rather set up a new form of government
divided into a legislative, executive, and judicial
organization similar to our federal set-up. This is
all well and good and perhaps it is whatthe stu-
dents want. But stock should be taken of exactly
what ideas and what philosophy of government we
are abiding by at the present moment. Consider
its faults and its good points and then analyze the
new set-up, weigh your opinions, and make your
decision.

Whether the group of people involved is located
in the mountain territory of the Rockies or in the
Student Association of State College. there must
be some organization. Too frequently, people fail
to take advantage of the opportunities and ad-
vantages that are wide open for exploration and
development at their feet and they strive madly
for the ideals, the “Green Pastures,” anything
which sounds good to them but which is a little
out of reach.

Needless to say. however. we have had many
concrete situations where this dissatisfaction was
shown. Not many of the students can forget the
recent assembly with the protest concerning the
replacement Myskania elections. There was no idle
talk or careless complaint here. The assemblage
almost resembled a bunch of howling animals
who were seeking revenge on their prey. Then too,
a lack of genuine interest is shown by the fresh—
man class, the class that ordinarily seems to have
so much energy and pep that it wears the other
classes out. Numerous examples could be cited to
illustrate this situation.

Here we are with everyone in the school think-
ing affairs are in an awful state. its been almost
like a gnawing disease which has spread like wild-
fire. it is not the reaction of just this year. but
the culmination came this past semester. The up-
perclassmen have not helped the situation very
much but rather have seemed to take pleasure in
their constant criticism.

There is no doubt that something must be done.
This something must be intelligent, however. if we
can hope to maintain it for any longer than a per-
iod of four or live years. ()pen hearings on the pro—
posed plan will begin Tuesday evening at 7:30
pm. in Room 20. The only way that a new gov-
ernment process can be adopted and set tip is by
the approval of the Student .~\ssociation. You're
restlessW—you're dissatisfied you feel that the old
spirit anti sense of work is gone take stock of
yourself" haven't you been affected by just talk?
Could you each give a five minute dissertation with
real arguments on why we are lethargic? Then
start thinking and by all means act as you see fit.

STATI COLLIGI NIWI. FRIDAY. FEBRUARY 11. 1949

 

J/ow Radical 6m 1/044 422?

 

Last Wednesday night, a commit-
tee of ﬁve, people presented a pro-
posed change in student govern-
ment to Student Council. What
were some of the changes suggest-
ed? =Are these changes really new?
Did this thorough revision come
from only ﬁve people?

What are the basic revisions pro-
posed under this new plan? Where
will we go under such a change?
The trail goes:

1. FROM Town Meeting Democ-
racy and minutiae assemblies TO
Representative government.

2. FROM a quasi-executive hon-
orary society TO a Judiciary ap-
pointed for judicial qualiﬁcations.

3. FROM a preferential ballot
for one office election TO direct
primary and direct election by vot-
ing machines.

For years Student Association has
complained of inefﬁcient assemblies.
Expanded enrollment has made Fri-
day mornings hurt even more. With
a larger Association there is even
more agitation for a. representative
government. “Do something about
that Friday morning stuff," has
been the persistent cry. The criti-
cism of Myskania has been the
criticism of the judiciary. Where
but at State College does the judge
act as prosecutor. judge and juror
with a little of the executive tossed
in? The desire has been for a sound

By MULLIGAN and LANGSLEY

 

judiciary—not quasi-executives; the
sentiment has been for a judiciary
selected for ability—not popularity;
the students have criticized Mys-
kania for being everything but the
judges. The African or preferential
ballot that applies preferential vot-
ing to one ofﬁce elections has been
criticized. Students know that of-
ﬁcers are being elected on 3rd, 4th
and 5th choice votes which count
the same as ﬁrst choice votes. In no
government situation is preferential
voting used when there are less
than five people to be elected. The
demand for this change comes from
you students.

A committee has put these sep-
arate demands for change together
into a complete system. Put them
all together and they look BIG.
Look at them singly an they are
things you have talked about—ask-
ed for—agitated for.

What can you do about it? You
can compromise by changing one
thing at. a time and by trying to
ﬁt it into an unsatisfactory system.
You can also organize an expedient
change that embodies. under a uni-
ﬁed plan, the very changes you
have asked for your growing stu-
dent body.

You can call it radical—if you
want—but it's what you've asked
for. . .

 

[haw ll’ew Wade!

By STANLEY ABRAMS

 

We were sitting over at the Boul.
pointing out the picturesque murals
to a group of mid-year frosh. when
someone brought up the matter of
exams and marks at State. Seeing
as how We had just cotne through
the biannual nightmare of exam
week. we were full of pertinent
ideas and invective. The newcom-
ers took it all in—the same could
be said for the murals. And as we
went down the line condemning in-
dividual teachers. one of the more
audacious of the new group the
must have been a vett blotted up
his coffee from the tabletop and
opened his mouth.

“Are exams really that bad?" His
tone seemed to indicate his hope
for a negative answer. “Do they
really flunk you on one exam .Can
they keep you from graduating?
Can they "

“Just. a minute." said the heav-
iest member of our party. “didn‘t
anyone tell you how such things as
marks and exams were worked at
State?"

The silence was music to the ears
of the neophyte practice teachers
present. It was obvious to even the
dumbest of us talthough, statistic-
ally speaking there are no dumb
students at Statet that the new-
comers had not the slightest inkling
of how these things really worked
out at State. Here was information
worthy of a place in the handbook
or directory or NEWSWbut found in
none.

“Well. it's not half as bad as We
may make it. out to be." The fat
one. still holding the floor. threw
out as if his heart were taking les-
sons elsewhcre. "Of course you've
come at a bad time: you should've
been eased liito this situation. But
I suppose that since the cat's out.
of the bag we should let you have
the benefit of our experience."

On signal the background music
tsoimding stratiger like So 'l‘lredt
helped supply the needed atmo-
sphere.

"Evoryone who comes to Shite
must. have proved himself ready
and worthy by virtue of his regents
record and his ability to speak Eng-
lish. We can be assured. therefore.
that “’0 always will get the cream
of the high schools in the. state
Now. to insure our turning out good
teachers We have set up certain
standards which must be met by all
aspiring pedngogncs. 'l‘hesc stand—
ards crop tip in the courses each
student must mid/or desires to take.
Actually Wt‘ have all sorts of“ cours-
es. Some are so important to the
well being of State Students that.
they just cannot be done without
tand you need to meet ii higher
standard for tlieset. Others are just
its well done without. mud. in order
to place full blame upon the. stu-

 

 

dents’ shoulders. these are called
electivesu Some courses must be
taken as an introduction to other
courses which are desired (these
are called Dragon‘s Teeth, after the
armament of the same namet. It‘s
a well known fact that a student
who doesn't have the proper intro—
ductory course will not do well in
an advanced course—he‘ll never ev—
en get a chance to demonstrate how
ill he would fare."

“Not. just anybody can flunk
courses. Since we had whole cream
to start with. flunking must result
frotn factors other than those re-
lating to mentality. Sotne students
get nervous and wash out early.
Sotne do so much for the school ac-
tivities that they can‘t quite meet
standards. There even was one case
in which an instructor just didn‘t.
get along with one or tnore stu—
dents and he . tat this point
someone ordered a fried single. and
who can compete with Petc?t Sotne
even refuse to do two hours of pre-
paration l'or each class period. The
cream gets spilt all along the way-
side."

“Yoii‘re probably wondering how
exams fit into the picture." The
listeners were letting their eyes
wander upward once againha sure
sign of boredom. "They‘ll tell you
that filial exams aren't the only
factors considered in the making of
your course grade. They'll tell you
that they'll be watching you in ac-
tion all year long and giving you
credit for your day by (lay accomp-
lishments. They'll tell you that
they're looking for Well rounded
people. ’I‘hcy'll tell you that. one ex-
am really doesn't prove or disprove
anything. Some of them will even
tell you not to cram. to get a Hood
night's sleep before all finals."

lie stopped to take II deep breath.
"They really don't menu it. Sonic-
liow memories grow short iiroiind
t-xnm time. Somehow a whole sc-
niestei"s work will stand or fall on
one illltll. Somehow it just doesn't
pay to get it good night‘s sleep."

It must have been because the
Iiiusic stopped. but. we all started to
put on our coats and wipe off our
cliiirges’ chins.

"in it way the whole set up is
screwy." I"llt was still nuttlering. "it
makes it. sort of hard to enjoy most
courses and it makes It more prolll-r
able. to conserve energy iIll semester
for the one big push. And in so far
as it conforms to psychological
principles of learning . "

Here he stopped. The irosh t‘lttllt'-
ly did not understand this last
phrase and chances Were good
that they never really would.

The Gommon-Stater is given the widest latitude as
author of this column, although his viewpoints do
not necessarily reﬂect those of the STA“ COLLEGE
Nuws.

WELCOME . . .

. . . to all the new freshmen and transfer students.
Glad to have you with us. We don't make any money
here but we sure do have our kicks.

THE PAUSE THAT REFRESIIED

Most people are in agreement on the value of the
two day vacation between semesters. We'll lose a day
at Easter. and again at Moving Up Day but the time
is more appreciated now. The only ones who lost out
were the practice teachers. They were all moping
around Monday and Tuesday . . . dressed up but. de-
jected.

BIG HELP

We've heard many a gripe about. the slow handling
of marks between semesters. the confused registration
procedure last September. etc. Now the shoe pinches
the other foot. Approximately 400 students didn't
see ﬁt to register on the speciﬁed days last week.
Sotne probably had good reasons but we doubt that
there were 400 good ones. We wonder how many out
of that 400 are the ones who gripe when the adminis-
tration won't cooperate.

BIG TIME

A few weeks ago I brought up the question of the
backing that the basketball players receive here at
State. The latest gripe is a lulu. Next Wednesday the
team plays away and won‘t return until 3 or 4 Thurs~
day morning. Nevertheless. the. players must meet
their 8:10 methods sections or any other class that
they might have at that time.

Yessir. boys. the administration is behind you . . .
‘way behind.

THE JUNIOR (‘LASS . . .

. has really been hard bit during its time at
State. We‘ve lost many of our outstanding workers.
The most recent to leave are Sue Miller. Ruth Cook—
inghain and Lyle Walsh. Site and Ruth probably
won't return but Lyle promises to be back as soon
as he is able.

(‘ONS’I‘ITII’I'ION REVISION (‘()MMI'I"I‘EI£

This committee is doing more than revising our
present constitution. It is creating a new form o
government. There seems to be little doubt that w
need state changes and this committee has t'tililt‘ It
with some worthwhile ideas. Some of the genera'
questions flint were asked at Student Council arc:

1. Can the new constitution l)t‘ drafch in Illitt'
for the spring elections? Don Langsley, t't)llllllllit‘l'
chairman. says that it can. The six meetings prior I )
moving tip day must be reserved for voting and for
consideration of the budget no matter what form o‘.
government we have. This leaves six assembly meet--
ings.

2. Under the proposed form. are the pre<idcnl's
powers of appointment too broad? He will appoint
the Student Court members Iwith the approval of
the Student SCtiaict.

3. In the case 01' single offices. voting will be done
by direct balloting. State College had direct ballot—
ing before our present preferential system. Is there
any assurance that the reasons that the direct bul—
lot didn't work before won't crop up again?

These arc just a few of lllt‘ questions that come
up at Student Council Wednesday night. Your opin-
ions flt‘t‘ important. 'I'I'y to attend the open meetings
that the cor niitce will have starting next week.

. . . . “I’m surprised State doesn’t

incoming transfer students. who.
in their confused innocence, fell
prey to a couple of roving tand we

quite readily. and were easily per-

You‘ve heard of graduates going
