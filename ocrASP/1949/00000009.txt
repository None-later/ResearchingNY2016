I Take Issue
. . . With those people who say that

Rivalry is dead. Sure, it doesn’t '

look like the "‘good old days” when
more kids turn up at an intramural
game than at a rivalry sport, but
maybe that's because no one is ex-
actly positive as to what’s going on.
It would be nice to have more pub-
licity. since publicity is what makes
or breaks any event around this
pasture. but we commence on the
vicious cycle of scheduling diffi-
culties. With Rivalry Committee
and the athletic organizations rail-
ing at each other over responsibil-
ity and initiative why not at least
think over tentative plans to have
an officer of MAA and WAA, pre-

ferany the V. P., on the Rivalry .

Committee; cooperation might bring

the united front that breeds interest.
I Take Issue

. . With those who fumble out
loud trying to lay the blame for
a State loss. “State is sharply limi-
ted in facilities (having neither
field nor gym, to speak of) equip-
ment (except for the generosty of
the students—the state is niggard-
1y), faculty (after all one man can
do only so much), and money (al-
lahi). In addition we have the usu-
al number of critics, regulations and
brass, plus the Milne darlings. With
all of this, it is fair to ask, "Do we
have any athletic program at all?"
(purloined with many thanks from
the memoirs of an ex-MAA presi-
dent). iAnswer—Yes).

Mostly

. . I took the issue now you can
take me to a stretcher.

Resume lM Basketball ,

Resuming play after a long lay-
off the Intramural basketball lea-
gues are. confronted wth .a freak
schedule.’At the close of last sem-
ester KB gained a tie for firsu
place in the “A” league and the
Bulls gained a tie for first in the
"B" League.

With the scheduling of the Sto-
kes-Peterson concert Monday night
two games and teams have been
changed to new times, as listed be-
low.

KB, paced by Jerry Berger, won
their second game in as many tries
by drubbing VDZ: 45-19. In a game
marked by fouls KB took an early
lead and was never in danger. VDZ‘s
scoring came mainly in field goals
by Rinsberg and George Lein.

The Gents won their second of
three games by handing the Angles
their second defeat: 42-26. Paul
Bullock’s 24 points (to give him 53

in three games) proved too much
for the Angels.

Following the Gent-Angel contest
the Redskins won their first game
this year by beating the Scrubs:
37-16.

The Beavers continued their win-
ning ways by dribbling over the
Mitey Mites: 45-11. The combination
of Burt and Lampman overpowered
the Mites.

By PAUL BUCHMAN

The gym seemed gloomier than
usual under its dim, yellow lights.
A heavy, sweaty fog seemed to
clamp and grasp at you as you
watched the human pogo-sticks
that were scrimaging in front of
you.

I grabbed Jim Warden from the
floor and started talking with him.
Sweat poured off his face, and he
was grasping in short, wheezy
breaths.

“Tired?", I asked.

“Plenty.”

“You played a good game Tues-
day against Hartwlck."

“Thanks. Eveybody was looking
pretty good that night. It‘s too bad
we had to lose."

He got back in line. Jack Marks,
a transfer from Brockport, fed him
a pass as he drove under the bas-
ket. He stopped abruptly, faked to
his left, pivoted like a machine,
and arched it through. Just like
that. His shot is graceful, his style
is smooth, yet tricky and dcciev-
mg.

Next time around he used a one-
handed push shot that he seems to
control with uncanny accuracy.

Jim, who calls Cornwall-on-Hud-
son home, is 21, an Army vet with
service in the land of the rising
sun, and has been playing basket-
ball nigh on to ten years.

The short, superbly conditioned
athlete has been playing the hoop
game since the sixth grade. He is
primarily a basketball player. and
the dark, curly haired follow is
probably the shortest first baseman
in the area.

Timed Backboard Man

His team mates call him one of
th: best backboard men on the
squad. This defensive phasc of th-s‘
game. while too often ovcrlookcd.
irrai‘se it is not as spectacular as
fzinr-v shooting. calls in precision
timing and spl‘lng—likc legs.

 

 

Hc sprung from the floor for a
rebound, and dribbled quickly into
i‘ie corner. He passed behind 10
Sr Farr h in the buckct. spun. dart—
i‘il through the center, look a hund-
oi‘f from Sy, and turning in mid-
air, pushed one easily through thc
basket. He grinned broadly us hc
run past.

Keep First Place Lead
With Two-Pin Victory

Although the NEWS staff closed
house during the exam period the,
Varsity Bowling squad continued
their winning ways in the Inter-
Collcgiate League during the past
three weeks. Two weeks ago, the
Statesman whitewashed the Law
School quintet 3-0, and on the fol-
lowing Wednesday, they took two
out of three from Pharmacy. Al-
though they suffered a two-game
defeat at the hands of R. P. 1.
Wednesday night, the squad still
maintains their slight first place
advantage over the runner-up En-
gineers. The teachers have a two-
game edge.

In this week‘s match the States-
inen dropped the first two games,
but they came back to take the
finale by a margin of two pins. Joe
Caroscllii‘s 213 single game was the
big gun that dccidcd ilic victory.

Don McDonald finished with a

Mark With 34 Points

A highly favored Hartwlck quin-
tct whipped a rugged State College
five: 83-67. Wednesday night in
Page Hall.

Hartwlck jumped to an early lead
in the first few seconds of the ball
game by virtue of a pair of field
goals by Vcrcrouse. From that point
on Hartwlck was never headed and
took a comfortable command of the
game.

Coach Bradley's aggregation dis-
played fine offensive and defensive
play throughout the ball game. Us-
ing primarily the fast break the
visitors were constantly getting the
jump on the ‘Peds". State was also
lunioicappcd by their lack of height
as (‘Olllllill‘;(l to their opponents.
Hartwlck had complete control of
both the offensive and defensive
backboards throughout the contest.

The visitors scored mainly from
about the foul line on direct plays
rcvolving around the bucket man
and by many one—handed tap shots.

Ccnicr Vcrcouse and forward Hi-
i‘i'u sparked the Hartwick attack
by dumping in 13 and 23 points re-
spcctivt‘ly; Hiffu scoring 14 points
in the third period before leaving
the gnmc for committing five per-
sonal fouls. State was led by Fcrsh
who st'orcd 16 points and sparked
by rugged Jim Wurdcn who chip—
