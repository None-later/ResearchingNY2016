Red Whistle Remains Silent,-
Tony Recovers At Hospital

Some of the students have
noticed that the sound of Tony
the Janitor‘s red whistle has
been absent from the usual
noise in lower Draper. Tony is
in Albany Hospital for an op-
eration and the removal of a
cyst from his face. It will be
some weeks before he again
goes through the crowded hall
with his broom, blowing his
whistle at the unwary or sing-
ing an Italian tune under his
breath.

Often at Fraternity Smokers
and dances. Tony would come
to watch from the balcony. He
exchanged jokes and made con-
versation. At the dances. when—
over he dropped in, he immedi-
ately became a popular target
for the girls.

All who know him value
his friendship. Student Council
has passed a motion to take up
a collection for Tony.
