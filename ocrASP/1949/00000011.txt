Perspective - - -

How much do we take advantage of what we
have? Dissatisfaction with conditions at State often
depends upon comparisons with colleges whose
purposes are different from ours. Due to State’s
position as an essentially vocational school, sup-
ported by the state, some unjust criticism arises
from comparison with privately endowed colleges
and universities.

If, however, we will compare State with other
schools which by superﬁcial deﬁnition have nearly
the same purpose as ours, we find that State has
many of the advantages, for the students, particu-
larly in respect to extra curricular activities.

Our present specialization in student activities
has arisen, generally, directly from the student
body. More activities are continually arising from
this same non-administrative source. Responsibil-
ity for successful administration and maintenance
of standards rests entirely with its—there is no
supervision, faculty or otherwise. This is a won-
derful opportunity. We don’t know our own power.

Perhaps we do not take advantage of the oppor-
tunities which we have procured for ourselves. Too
few people really participate in the organizations
for which they vote their money. It's not scotch
to waste time and/or experience.

Do you want to write—~creatively, factually, per-
suasively? Do you have the urge to speak—rhetor-
ically, forcefully, or in a foreign language? Would
you like to act, work backstage, or make costumes?
Do you need to understand community problems,
or problems of social tension? Do you want to
work with children? Are you interested in ath-
letics? Do you want to publicize the school, your
fellow students? Do you need to meet people? Will
you further your religious comprehension?

The student body of State College can. and has,
given itself the things it needs and wants. By the
same authority, it is the student body which uses
those things.

In Addition - - -

Our student government, as an important ex-
tra-curricular activity, has arisen froin the stu-
dents. A drastic change has been proposed now.
This change would move the mechanics of govern«
ment out of the rightful hands of the entire stu-
dent association, into the hands of their elected
representatives. The system of electing representa-
tives grew out of the necessity of keeping the gov-
erning group from becoming so large as to be un-
wieldy. It would seem that Student Association is,
so far, small enough not to need a representative
government.

Change in any government is essential to balance
and progress. Some parts of our system, including
the tradition of a jiidiciary-hontirary group, may
need revision. There are "loopholes" in other parts
of the constitution. Revision, however, or change
in any part of the system, should not necessitate
a complete turnover.

The whole power of change is, of course, in ilie
hands of the student body. Our present system
of government does not seem to warrant such a
complete change from it. Alteration and adjust-
ment, not a new set of clothes, are what we need.

Brotherhood Week—a farce, a
function or feasibly a function de-
veloped into a farce? Any reply is
opinionated and mine follow.
Brotherhood Week does have a very
good purpose but its meaning has
been confused by too many words
and a few futile actions. Its pur-
pose is “to obtain for others the
rights we want for ourselves.” It's
objective is an attempt at the so-
lution of the "tolerance" problem.
It is definitely a step in the right
direction. The solution is not in
carrying on campaigns against hate
but rather in establishing love. Hate
cannot be abolished without love.
Brotherhood Week seems to be a
hypocritical observance. One week
is set apart in which we get to-
gether to tell each other how un—
prejudiced we are. Then we go
back to our diverse paths—some
over-tolerant, some intolerant and
some purely tolerant (those who be-
lieve in acceptance of members of
minority groups as individuals).

Over-tolerance or hypocritical
tolerance does exist. It is mani-
fested by those people who have
been overcome by too much of a
good thing—a professed tolerance
which is neither believed in the
heart nor functions in action. It
is expressed in the person who goes
out of his way to display non-pre-
judice to others while unconscious-
ly he is attempting to prove it to
himself. (With him such words as
Jew. Negro, Catholic. Greek. Prot-
estant and Mongolian are taboo in
public but are perfectly presentable
to himself alone.) This person has
not the realization that he prob-
ably does have prejudices within
himself and if in some cases he has,
he may condemn them as faulty
and do nothing to rectify them, but
keeps them concealed within him-
self. Condemnation without cor-
rection is useless. The result is a
guilt complex and an extreme ef-
fort to prove to others that racial
and religious discrimination are
not a part of his personality. In-
tolerance is then confused with so-
cial discrimination. The hypo-
critical tolerant believes that he
must be overly tin reality falseiyi
friendly with anyone who is a mem-
ber of a minority group. This sit—
uation, particularly on our campus,
is the result of too many direct
attacks on intolerance.

In the intolerant group we find
two sections. First there are those
who are grossly prejudiced and ad-
mit it. They calmly confess their
intolerance and their indifference
to it. That's the way they're made,

To the Editor:
To the Class of 1950:

Twice in three years the student
government 01' State has been
judged inadequate and has been
cast aside for something more
workable. Many of its recall with
a certain amount. of foreboding the
circumstances and results of the
last change.

The Constii iitioiiiil R e vision
Committee has unquestionably
made it very intelligent approach
and the efficiency resulting from a
student government based upon
such it plan is nearly as unques-
tloiiuble.

ls such efficiency desirable? His—
tory teaches us that efficiency and
dcmocriiey vary inversely. This
stiiteiiieiit is ’

 

debatable but it is
worthy of consideration.

The Juniors. more than anyone
else, will be held responsible for
any decision the student. body
makes, because it is you to whom
will fall the. job of either organi-
zing it new government teither the
type proposed or some otlicri, or
making the present one work.

When you do finally make. your
collective choice, you will be your
own judges. Are. you, individually,
willing to unstiiiic the responsibili-
ties which a New England Town

poses. or, III the interests of effi-

ernment. technicians?

_____._——-
they say, and they refuse to change.
Here an attitude of defiance is the
outcome of continuous condemna-
tion of intolerance. (Under this
classification We often find the
“name callers" who shout "radical"
or "communist" at anyone who sug-
gests tolerance.) Secondly, and in
the majority, we find those who ra-
tionalize their intolerance. These
people are adept at finding reasons
why religious and racial distinction
are permissible. Again confusion
between social and religious or rac-
ial discrimination results from the
belief that intolerance is social dis-
crimination. However, these people
are frequently able to accuse
others of intolerance, not realizing
that theirs is of the same species.
No one has the right to condemn
intolerance unless he condemns it
wherever it is found. Involved here
somewhere we often discover the
fraternities and sororities that do
discriminate in their membership.
In some instances we find far-
fetched reasons as to why they
discriminate and in some iso-
lated instances why it should re—
main so. Thoreau had a thought
that I think applies here very well.
The essence of it poses the ques-
tion—“if you can't right a wrong,
why support it?"

In between the over-tolerant and
intolerant there is a pure tolerant.
True, it is difficult to acquire, how—
ever, its difficulty does not pose
its impossibility. Pure tolerance is
obtainable but we must strive for
it. Next week is an excellent op-
portunity for us all to start indi-
vidually—for tolerance must come
from the individual, not from leg-
islation which makes discrimina-
tion illegal or from social dictation
making prejudice wrong or from
one week which makes tolerance
right. Brotherhood is a year-round
job and to set aside one week in
which to confine it is futile. tIt
is a beginning of the establishment
of understanding among all races
and religions. We can approach
it that way and follow throughi

CAMPUS COMMISSION

Could extra ash trays be put on the tables in the
Commons? . . . and a. receptacle at the door leading
from the Commons for those who grab a between-
period smoke and don’t butt their cigarettes until
they are leaving the Commons? . . . and maybe some
new headings for the clam bulletin board?
CONSTITUTION REVISION COMMITTEE

Wouldn’t it be better to have a fairly decent consti-
tution to work under when the proposed constitition
is discussed?

In the first place. it would provide a fairer way to
judge our present set-up. In the second place, we're
working with a $20,000 budget here at State and at
that figure its seems that we should give the discus—
sion the best conditions possible.

WE WONDER . . .

. . . how long it will take the new constitution to
work if it is passed? Last spring. a class board of
ﬁnance was constitutionally created and was to start
operating last September. That Committee is still
not functioning. Would a new form of government.
or more interest on the parts of those concerned.
correct a condition such as this?

Any form of government will be no better than its
administrators.

GOOD COURSEII

So say the students who have taken Ed 131 . . . a
library reference course dealing with the variou..
major ﬁelds. Bob Baker '49 claims that it is t‘Hpcchilli
valuable for English and social studies majors.
ALL STUDENT ORGANIZATIONS .

whether supported by Student Asso-iaiion
budget or not, are required to register with Stiideizi
Council if they Lise college facilities. This applies to
such organizations as Students for Democratic Action
for World Federation.

There may be some opposition to this move but
one fact remains . . . State College is supported by
the state and therefore it is only right for the ad
ministration to know the organizations or people
who use the college‘s facilities.

PRESS BUREAU

This is a student organization btit its ilt‘('tilil“ll‘sli~

they're devoting their time to taking care oi' 1ip<

To the Editor:

During the past three weeks. four
State College Students have, asked
me to get them policies under the
Student Medical Expense Plan. You
see, they were already ill and need-
ed immediate expensive medical
treatment. Although I would like
to have been able to do so. it was
impossible to cover an already ac-
tive illness. At the risk of getting
corny, it's the old story of locking
the burn door after the horse has
been sioleii.

It's still possible to enroll in the
plan for the rest of the year up to
next Septciiibei' 23rd for a premium
of less than $15. l'd like to urge
all State College Students to enroll
before they need medical treatment,
not after it‘s too late. The value of
the plan is that one biiys protection
and when it's needed, it‘s available
tip to a $500 maximum per illness
or injury.

Just send name and check for
$15 to Arthur Kapiier, 75 State
Street. Albany. l'le'll do the rest and
return the proper change. Don't

26. Studentg roups will take over
the loWer halls of State College and
transform them into a carnival at-
mosphere. SLS will feature, this
year, a “dunking” booth instead of
its customary "sponging" booth.
KDR is planning a. very special
kind of racing and Beta Zeta will
operate a basketball shot booth.

Sayles Hall promises a» present-
ation of the problems in the “Life

tion to State Fair. Alpha Espilon
Phi promises to foresee the future
(for a sum) at their concession
“The Stars Speak," also in lower

StoieMCollgge'Sfudenfs Near Heaven, NEWS Poll Reveals,

If Money Is Considered T

not headed for purgatory, according
to a recent. poll taken by two NEWS
reporters. Obstacles included re-
luctant interviewees hiding be-
ind tightly clutched books ($7.50
worth for a two hour coursei and
the mud of St. Mary's. where. one
veteran gallantly declared on the
subject of the G. 1. Bill "You can
exist. on it, but you can‘t live on it."

for those male students who are
lucky t?i enough to live at one or
the residence houses. the estimated
cost of a semester of college life
ranges $400 to $700. This includes
not only room and board. regis-
tration fees, and books. but such
incideiitals as laundry and WOM-
EN. Most of the fellows rated these
last two items as their biggest. prob-
lem and expense.

For Fee Payment

Cooper, Folder Release
March 1 Budget Limit

Announcements concerning the
immediate payment of student fees,
diploma fees, and the submitting
of the budgets by the campus or-
ganizations have been released by
Rodney Folder ’49, secretary of the
Student Board of Finance.

All new students who enrolled
at State in February should report
immediately to Dr. Edward L. Coop-
er's office. Room 303 Draper, to pay
their student fees of $8.50.

All seniors and graduate students
are required to pay $3 for their
diplomas. Due to the fact that the
diplomas must be ordered in ad-
vance the students are requested
to pay their fee at Dr. Cooper's
office either Tuesday or Thursday
morning.

Felder has announced that the
G. 1. bill provides for the payment
of the diploma fees for the vet-
erans. However, the veterans are
required to go to Dr. Cooper's of-
fice to sign up.

All state organizations supported
by Student Association must have
deposited their budgets in Dr. Coop-
er's office not later than noon
March 1 because the open budget
meetings will be held during the
first two weeks of March. The bud-
get will be presented in Assembly
March 18, according to Felder.
