STATE COLLEGE NEWS. FRIDAY. FEBRUARY 18. 1949

Varsity Faces New Paltz Tonight, spa-ea

Meets Utica College Tomorrow

Team Drops Two
On Road Trip

State returns to Page Hall to-
night facing New Paltz Teachers.
This is the second meeting of the
two teams, with State holding the
edge. Tomorrow the Varsity tra-
vels to Utica to face Utica Col-
lege. This will be the first game of
a home and home series between
the twa clubs.

The Purple and Gold of State
dropped two games on the road,
last weekend to Fitchburg and New
Britain College.

Fitchburg Winner

Friday night, State opposed a
mediocre Fitchburg Five and was
turned back by the home team 68-
57. In the early seconds of the
game. Fitchburg's high scoring cen-
ter. Jerry Millane. contributed a
pair of field goals and forward
“Specs” Erickson dropped in a few
more to give the home team a 8-0
lead. After Fitchburg held the
8-0 lead, Tom O’Brien dented the
nets for State's first tally to make
it an 8-2 contest. From this point
to the end of the half, both teams
scored rather freely and State came
out at the short end of a 42-21
score.

Second Half Even

The second half was a repitition
of the first with both teams about
even in the scoring column. Fitch-
burg threw up a zone against the
visitors and won the ball game
through State's inability to drive
through it.

Saturday night saw a highly
favored New Britain Teachers Col-
lege of Connecticut trounce the
“Feds” 68-37. The teachers of
Connecticut combined a fast
breaking offense and a switching
man to man defense to thrash the
statesmen. Early in the game both
teams could not find the hoop and
not until 4 minutes had elapsed in
the ball game did New Britain
score. The home team went on scor-
ing and held a 29—12 lead at half
time.

’l‘eams Run Wild

In the second half the home town
ran wild. State. unaccustomed to
Ihe prairie-like court. could not
gets its offense underway. New
Britain used the fast break and
scored repeatedly from underneath
the basket. Johnson paved the way
for the home team with 13 points
while Fersh dumped in 14 for the
losers.

The remainder of the schedule
for the season is as follows:

Frl.. Feb. 18—Ncw PﬂiCZ—«HOIHL‘.

Humphrey Bogart Marzello
Cleans Up Fitchburg, Mass.

Abraham Lincoln Marzello
experienced two great events
this past weekend. both of which
are remarkable. The first was
his birthday and it was prop-
erly received. He was feted at
the New Britain contest and
addressed his guests in his na-
tive tongue.

The second was the acquisi-
tion of his pen name Humphrey
Bogart Burt Lancaster Mar-
zello. This, of course, demands
and explanation and this is
how it goes.

It seems that one fine day
in the gay city of Fitchburg.
Lincoln went shopping. He ac-
quired, by some unknown means,
a rubber dagger. On his way
back to the hotel he encoun-
tered a suspicious looking char-
acter. So. tough-like, Lincoln
walked up to the 12-year-old
Paul Bunyan and pressed his
dagger against IFaul's chest and
uttered these forceful words,
“Get out of my way, Mac." Mr.
Bunyan siezed up the situa—
tion and pulled out his 12—inch
collapsible stiletto and uttered
this answer: “Get out of my
way. Mac." As we hear it Lin-
coln quickly relinquished his
position.

Well, Humphrey Abraham

Lincoln Marzello Bogart is
back amongst friends once
again.

 

WAA Breaks Even
At Area Piayday

A team from WAA won two and
lost two at a playday at Russell
Sage. February 12. Elly Adams.
Phyllis Harris. Jean Hotaling. Ruth
Matteson. Elsa Moberg, Edie Pater-
son, Beverly Sittig. and Ruth Smith
made up the basketball team.

State defeated Middleburg by a
score of 3-2 and Mt. Holyoke 9-2.
The girls lost to Skidmore 11-10.
Vasar poured it on and dumped
the State team 19-3.

Vassar Wins Four

The teams were all very good, es-
pecially Vassar, which won all four
of their games by comparatively
large scores. Zone defense was used
by both Skidmore and Russell Sage.
Vassar varied their methods of
playing depending on their oppon-
ent. State, Mt. Holyoke and Mid-
dlebury consistently played a “man
to man" game. The peplest team
was Mt. Holyoke which was com-
posed entirely of freshmen. Coin-
plcting their exams on Friday, the
frosh were the only ones able to
make the trip.

Varsity Bowlers
Lose To Siena,
Tie For 1st Place

The battle for first place in the
intercollegiate League is all-tied up
once again. Paced by Campochlaro,
the Siena Indians trounced the
statesmen in two out of three games-
Wednesday night at the Playdium.
While the teachers were going down
to defeat, RPI grabbed three games
from the Pharmacy five. Before
Wednesday's match. the statesmen
enjoyed a slight advantage over
the Engineers, but due to their loss
and RPI's victory, the two clubs
are now deadlocked at 36 wins and
15 losses each.

Handicapped by late arrivals in
the first tilt, the statesmen were
no match for the onrushing In—
dians who tumbled the lumber for
a total of 913. In the second game,
the Varsity came back to even up
matters. but lost the edge in the
finale when Campochiaro turned in
a nice 243 to pace his squad to vic-
tory.

Bob Dickenson led the States-
men in individual performances
with a three game total of 519. Joe
Carosella was very consistent with
games of 181 and 182. The other
match in the circuit saw the law-
yers from Law School who have
only been on the winning side
in two games this season take three
from ABC.

Next week. State is scheduled to
face the Lawyers, and the squad
will be out to break the first place
deadlock.

By PAUL BUCHMAN

Give me the game that is swift,

With lay-up and pivot and set.

Give me the court game that gives
me a lift,

As the ball rops clean through the
net.

I love to drive. an hook it in.

I love to move and run.

The roaring crowd. a thundering
din,

The mob at the final gun.

. Anon.

Paul Carter rocked uneasily from
one foot to the other as he stood
talking with me. He smiled warily
with that shyness and caution al-
ways present in someone being in-
terviewed by a writer.

He is short, unusually short for
an athlete, especially a basketball
player. Perhaps it is this elf-like
stature that explains the agility and
grace that he displays as a second
baseman for the State baseball
team, as a guard for the basketball
squad.

His grey sweat shirt was wet with
perspiration from his workout dur-
ing the scrimmage in the gym. Tak-
ing off his glasses to clean them.
he grinned casually and remarked.
“I’m ‘it‘ this week, eh?"

Caught by surprise, I laughed
and started the “grilling.”

“Where are you from. Paul?“
“North Tonawanda. New York. And
spell it right. T-O-N-A. . 

 O.K.." I broke in. "I‘ll look
it up in the directory. How old are
you?”

“I‘m 21. I worked for two years
after high school. and then came
to Albany State.”

vl< iii .11

Paul makes up for his lack of
height on the hardwoods by his ex—
tremely aggressive. ball-hawking
type of play. His most effective of-
fensive weapon is a fading, onc-
handed push shot that. he makes
while in the air. it is a pretty shot.
similar in style to that of Captain
Bud Palmer of the pro Knicker-
bockers.

The Carter tradcnuu'k is a shrill.
piercing “betwom—the-teeth" whis-
tlc that he uses whenever he plays
ball. His face is covered with a per-
petual smile. and his good humor
and joking seems contagious to
those around him. When "Myska-
nia" and "Siiillcs" run their annual
Christmas party at the Albany
Home for Children this year. he
was asked to bc the Master of
Ceremonies. His jokes and gay
manner proved irresistablc to thc
clnldrcn. and he was an instant.

T.C.C. Downs
State Five 76-68

Wednesday night State Col-
lege‘s varsity journeyed to Endi-
cott to meet an underdog Triple
Cities College team. The home team
downed the visitors, 76-67.

T. C. C. jumped to an early 7-0
lead and with the exception of
midway in the second period were
never seriously troubled by State's
offensive tactics. Led by their pint-
slzad forward, Mnrechek, the home
ttam hit consistently for field goals
about the foul line.

When the second half began T.
C. C. had a 37-35 advantage and in
the third stanza lengthened the
score to a 56-46 count. From there
on in defense was forgotten and
both sums scored rather freely on
fast breaks. pivot shots and from
plays involving the pivot man.

Marcchck and Jackson paced the
home team with 22 and 20 points
respectively. Fersh and Marks con-
tributed 28 and 15 for the losers.
