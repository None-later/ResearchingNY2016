By EVELYN WOLFE

“Heave—Ho me liearties, and raise
the rowboat! Perch that seagull on
the highest rope so his White Leg—
horn i'clithers won’t show! And.
where did Sparky put the iner-
maids?"

A pop—cyed fish on the wall of the
Colonic Country Club overheard
Earliiic (Ken) Thompson and her
crew of decorating Juniors planning
to make the three rooms of the club
into a Neptune's paradise for the
annual Junior From, March 5.

In the eerie glow of the (1001)
Ocean. strange ﬁgures will glide and
dip to the mystic rhythms of Mal
Pappin and his orchestra, while
Fran Mullin will give with the vo-
cals, from 9 pin. to 1 a.ni.

In keeping- with the Marine
Theme, all guests might be expected
to swim to the club. but unfortun—
ulcly. Herbert Ginsberg is in charge
of a cut-rate taxi system that will
deposit the guests at the door
and then make the deadline.

will be opportunity to sign up for
this service at the ticket booth out-
side the door to the Commons. The
idea of group-taxi service is rather
new but be -mise the Colonie is be—
yond Howard Johnson‘s on Central
Avenue. the Juniors thought it wise
to instigate it.

In response to the publicity of
Edith Miiich and her committee,
several Albany stores offered mater-
ials to help with the decorating.
Guests may expect to trip over sea
shells and hang themselves in fish
nets as they crane ‘1)llll for the
feather-ed specicsi their necks zit
the Queen who will be crowned on
deck and throncd on a silver and
blue creation destined to enhance
her beauty.

Care to relax in the Captain‘s

that the rooms procured for the
dance will have space for 1illld lub-
bcrs as well as "able seamen.“

Bcii Jackson is Captain of the
Ship of ‘50 as general manager.
while Davc Glcnday acts as First
Male in charge of Orchestration.
Joanne Bowen is Ticket Master and
has set the "duty" per bid at $3.

The Juniors have been working
for almost two months to make this
dance a success. Get hop to the
Sailors‘ Hornpipe and report for
duty at the Colonic Country Club.
when '50 will prove that you can
