How About A Decision?

The rights of the people can be heard and
listened to under our present governmental setup it
the students of the college are willing to stand up
for them, discuss .them, and revamp them as the
necessity arises.

For two weeks editorials have appeared urging
the student body to ﬁnd out exactly what the
newly proposed constitutional plan consists of in
its entirety. The philosophy behind the new plan
stands for the loss of individual rights in the busi-
ness of Student Association and the development
of a representative government to handle all of-
ficial business. If this is what the students wish,
this is fine. but are the members of the assemblage
going to sit back when the proposed plan comes
before the assembly and say nothing?

Such an extreme lack of interest may seem im-
possible but this is the only conclusion that can be
drawn from the microscopic attendance at the open
hearings held by the constitutional revision corn-
mittee. Twenty-live persons were present at the
second open hearing Tuesday evening—this was
the PEAK of attendance. As the situation stands
at present, the proposed plan which would so rad-
ically change our student government would have
little trouble passing through our student assembly.
If sudden spurts of energy or curiosity were to be
shown, the preliminary questions concerning such
a proposed change which should have been asked
during the open hearings would take Iip assembly
after assembly.

There is the important element of time which
should be taken into consideration. Eight assembly
periods are scheduled between this morning and
Moving-Up Day. Two of these will be concerned
with the budget and three will be taken up with
elections.

If there is to be action, it has to come immed-
iately. If there is to be NO action, that decision
should be made. The Revision committee has done
a great deal of work. Some persons claim that
they have not carried out the purposes for which
they were appointed. but that is neither here nor
there. Let's investigate this situation and new
proposal or advise the committee to forget their
ﬁndings concerning a new constitution and get to
work fast on the revising of our present Constitu-
tion.

For What Purpose ?

The so-called War Memorial Committee will
make its report this morning. li‘ivc suggestions
will be made and explained as a part of this com-
mittee's report. There seems to be much dissen-
sion as to whether the name of this committee
should be the War Memorial (‘ommittee or the
Organ Committee. I’erhaps a committee of Student
(‘ouncil has once again strayed from the purpose
for which it was appointed. Perhaps we should
begin to call a spade a spade. and a heart a heart.
l’erhaps Student Council must be a bit more spe—
cific as to the purpose of their committees before
appointing them.

ITATI COLLIGI NEWS. FRIDAY. FEBRUARY 25. 1940

 

 

0m Man’s 0W

 

Tuesday night’s bill of fare was
highly successful, particularly from
the point of audience reception.

Joan French deserves special mer-
it for attempting the somewhat dif-
ficult Antigone. It was refreshing
to see so many of our Thespians in
entirely new and different roles.
The set was most functional, the
lighting, extremely effective, and
the make—up excellent.

It was an example of many people
working together to achieve a sin-
gle end. When a play “flops,” so of-
ten the blame is placed entirely up-
on the director. In contrast, a “hit”
is so often accredited to the leading
character. In the case of Antigone,
the whole was a well controlled cul-
mination of parts.

George Christy gave a convincing
performance—a nice comeback after
a few rather shallow attempts.
Special mention too, to Caroline
Williams. who commanded attention

with her excellent stage presence
and pantomime.

Much can be said too, for the
attentive attitude of the audience.

Joe Keefe did a nice job of direc-
tion as indicated by well worked out
stage business in his production.

Harry Mills came through as
usual with a most enjoyable perfor-
mance. Seemingly Without effort,
Harry never lets his public down.

Joe Purdy was 'a bit overdone, but
no one really objected as the effect
was most hilarious.

Of the women, Jean Valachovic
and Roslyn Lacks were by far the
best—staying in character through-
out, but not always holding for
laughs. This is annoying to the au-
dience as many good lines are lost.
The impression given was that of
trying to get through as quickly as
possible. Golly, kids—with an audi-
ence like last Tuesday, “milk” every
line. They love it!

CORRECTION

An item in last week's column gave the Impressil
that Students for Democratic Action and Studm
for World Federation were one and the same orgw

mine.

I was later informed by an indignant member
SDA that his organization was already charter
while SWF was still in a rather nebulous stage
formation.

COMMITTEES

The two big committees this year (War Mcmo'
Committee and the Constitutional Revision Cr.
mittee) have been accused of “railroading.” 12':
was set up with a certain goal and each is now wo-
ing toward a different goal.

The WMC was to look into the suggestions for
war memorial. Now that committee has stated II
it wants to get an organ for Page Hall and doc.-
care if it is a war memorial or not.

The CRC was created to revise the present consli
tion. No constitutional revisions have been sugac
by that committee and we're still working with
hole-ridden constitution. They are working on :I :.
form of government although this wasn't the .I.
mittee's original purpose.

The WMC cannot be charged with railroading ho
ever. It was directed to concentrate on an or
by Student Council and therefore any accusanon
railroading must be directed to Council.

Ed Kurlander told the Sophomore class that
CRC was directed to work on a new form of goir z;
ment. As far as I know. this direction did not (on

emu,“ Turks, Rockelfes, Straight Locks: State To Present
Invade Slate During Hell Week

 

To the Editor:

Both the writers of the editorial
and the letter on the Constitutional
Revision in last week’s NEWS de-
fend their conservative views on the
basis of precedent. Precedent is one
way in which a rule or principle may
be said to be commonly established,
but not the only way, and often-
times not the best way. To be pre-
cise, these writers are concerned
only with the past, a little with the
present, and not at all with the
future.

We know that in the past three
years Student Association has
grown and will continue to do so.
Change folloyvs growth as inevitably
in social concept as in the physical.
Those of us who do not admit to
this have ourselves ceased to grow.
Witness the increasing number of
standees at the Student Association
assemblies. This growth is unwieldy
and indicative of change.

Since this is a teacher-training
institution let us seek reality in any
way we can. Our local, state, and
federal governments are patterned
in the form of representative legis-
latures. I do not necessarily infer,
however. that this is. or that any
other type of democratic govern-
ment is the best. But must we ig—
nore this until we actually have to
teach it in the classroom? Who of
us could not more easily explain and
demonstrate democratic action if we
had practiced it as it is found? M0st
of us here are of non—voting age.
Is this a good reason to ignore our
future obligations not only as vot—
ers in our local, state and federal
governments, but also as more active
participants? Let‘s face the fact that
our present type of government does
not. prepare us mechanically or
practically for this role.

For the sake of linking efficiency
with Democracy, must we every Fri—
day. encounter loop-holes, time lim—
its. procedural difficulties, and non-
functioning dead-weight? Student
Associatim is not extra-curricular.
We must pay the tax and we must
be in attendance. This is the only
course, and non-credit to be sure.
about which we have a say as to
what will be taught. Let us make
certain therefore, that We get what
we want and what will do us the
most good and at the same time.
establish some post-graduate credit!

John Morley '50.

To the Editor;

The recent request made by peti-
tion and by the NEWS for better
treatment of students during exam-
ination periods brings to light an
interesting situation with regard to
student-faculty-administration rela—
tions.

One of the unfortunate situations
in this college is the lack of ade-
quate student-faculty relations.
Though we have an elaborate sys—
tem ol facility advisors. no student
feels it necessary to consult his ad-
visor except. as II last resort. infor—
mation is more generally picked up
Ii'oin the NEWS and fellow students
"uIuicrground.” The point is that
there is no way for students (as II
group with group interests) to meet
with instructors in their particular
fields, to discuss topics outside the
scope of ordinary classroom discus—
sion»-~-in short. we lack an opportu—
Iiity to hold informal gab fests that.
would go a long way in bettering
student—faculty relations. Where is
thc opportunity to t‘Ulllt' from? The
answer is relatively simple.

There Is no doubt. i believe. that
as for us congcnlalily goes. We have
a grand faculty. For the Inost part.
ilicy lll‘t' casual. wariIi—licartc'l in—

The same is relatively true of the
student body. The question. then. is.
"Why In all these years have the
two groups remained apart?" Why
not it chain of sliidi'iIt—l'uculty in-

By DOROTHY MANN

Last week was the open season
for a certain species of game. name-
ly. pledges. Sororities and fraterni-
ties on campus Joined to make the
week wholly entertaining for them-
selves. the independents. and the
faculty, and left as much room for
laughs on the part of the pledges
as was deemed advisable.

Outside of requiring the pledges
to sweat it out at the houses doing
an alloted number of hours of
sweeping and scrubbing ﬂoors,
washing dishes and curtains, wax-
ing furniture, ironing drapes, and
general reﬁnishing work, the Greeks
had their little hopefuls gather to-
gether colorful bits of trash, and
run on ridiculous errands. One boy-
pledge had to run over to a certain
sorority and ask for the largest you-
know-what in the house, signed by
all the ladies there abiding. Another
boy-pledge had to obtain a black
mesh stocking that had been seen
on a girl the week before. A girl-
pledge had to run down to the Ten
Eyck and get the signature of the

head-waiter there. and another
girl-pledge had to get a lock of hair
from a boy who has little or none
to give.

The Commons at noon was a. high
time for reVelry. Everywhere could
be seen young men with huge pa-
per bow ties and little ladies wear-
ing red skirts and white blouses or
dressed as waitresses or turks. or
some other notable costume. Make-
up was out. and the poor dears had
to let their glorious locks hang
straight all week. Of course, no one
looked as particularly gruesome as
they have in former years.

The girls had to cut in on the
men, and the boy-pledges had to be
on the dance floor, no matter with
whom they had to dance. There
were rockettes, harmonica. ensem-
bles. and even a little yodeling. One
day a group of pledges brought
blankets and box lunches and had
a picnic in the middle of the ﬂoor.

Summarizing the week. one could
say that despite the dishabile.
pledges and Greeks had a good
time.

“Ughl.... Foreignersl”

 

 

students get together in small
groups with their instructors In or-
der to develop those mutual rela-
tions that serve basically to build
sound student-faculty relations?
Students would beneﬁt by talking
out their problems and interests, and
instructors would benefit from the
varied views presented and also by
the heightened classroom interest
that would be attendant upon these
asociiitions. Also, by being closely
attuned to student interests the in—
structor could bring a new spirit
into faculty meetings. No longer
would the administration have to
act in a manner that seemed to deny
the human relations factor in the
student body.

Critics will say that such associa—
tions are impossible for such rea-
nUllS as: The enrollment is too high.
(Is it?) We don‘t have an on—
cainpus faculty. (80 what?) These
and other critic'sms are merely peb-
bles. not stumbling blocks. on the
road to better relations. There are
available such places as the Lounge.
lilcliardson. etc. for meeting pur-
poses. There is no reason why we
cannot develop such Inasociiitions to
our mutual betterment.

Perhaps this is a shot in the dark,
but i am in hopes that. some con—
sideration will be given to this inat—
tcr by boili students and faculty.

on campus, the first step in secur-
ing room space is to register with

has not been registered will iioi
have space made available for its
use.

organizations in the process of be-
ing formed will register before Fri-
day. March 4. in the following man-
nor:
