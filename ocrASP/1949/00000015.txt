: 1 By PAUL

From out of the wooded terrain of
Schenectady. New York, straight on
through Central AVenue, to Albany,
and over to State comes Jim Jiusto,
the Dorpian gift to the class of 1951.
“The City that Lights and Hauls
the World,” home of Mont Pleasant
High school, which graduated him
from that school in 1947, where he
was a member of the Varsity bas-
ketball team, probably his greatest
single athletic achievement.

His list of accomplishments here
at State reads like a list of activi-
ties at the school.

Varsity Tennis Player

His intramural bowling average
was second highest in the school.
last year, and he played for the
Varsity tennis team. In addition to
all these twanty-four carat accom-
plishments, V-IP Jiusto made the
Dean’s List (the one that they post
on the bulletin board).

Active in Rivalry

The short, dark, well-proportioned
athlete starred for his class in Riv-
alry bowling, basketball and Big-8.
After being elected Vice-President
of 1951, he ably directed. many of
this year’s first class activities, viz.,
The Activities Day skit, and the
class square dance.

Beavers Need Two
To Cop Bowling Title

With one Week to go, the Bowling
League is about to close with the
Beavers in the lead. Two more Wins
will clinch the crown for the Beav-
ers. They suffered a set back Wed—
nesday, however, when they drop-
ped one game to SLS, while Van
Derzee was idle. SLS held its own in
league standings although they lost
two of three.

The Faculty finally came through
to win their second game of the sea-
son. Potter took the other two to
remain high in the league standings.
Mr. Gibson led the faculty with a
156 single and 453 triple. Bob Eich
led Potter with a 166 and 435.

KDR had an unexpected set back
when the Fearless Five routed
them, 2 to 1. Bill Dunn led the on-
slaught with a 182 single and 511
triple. KDR‘s cause w s aided by
Santora‘s 190 and Schultze’s 164
single and 457 triple.

The Fools walked over KB with
ease, taking 3 games. Volz had a
175 and 473 for the Fools. The
Gents forfeited to the Jerks.

A new Bowling Tournament to
supplement the bowling season will
be opened up soon. There will be
sign up sheets for singles, doubles.
and mixed doubles. It will be set up
on a handicap basis so that every
one will be encouraged to take part.

BUCHMAN

ing cause last year, “J.J.” exhibited
brilliant basketball during the rival-
ry tussles. In a one point loss to the
class of ’50, he almost single-hand-
edly won the game for the frosh, as
he Stink twenty-six points.

On the Page Hall Field on West-
ern Avenue, he is outstanding as an
Intramural League player. His
sparkling play on the soccer field
helped Potter Club roll to the cham-
pionship of this sport. Roving the
outfield for his fraternity, he covers
a lot (literally) of ground as a de-
fensive star. His hitting helped his
team into the first division of the
league.

With a scintillating smile and a
fascinating line of gab, Jim has one
of the outstanding personalities in
the school.

Varsity Bowlers
Drop To Second

A very poor second game proved
to be quite an expensive loss to
the Statesman Wednesday night.
This defeat dropped the Varsity
into second place, one game be-
hind the pace-setting RPI squad,
who trounced ABC three times to
take the lead. Before the match,
the statesmen and the Engineers
were deadlocked to a first—place tie.

After taking the first game by 122
piizs, the teachers fell apart: and
rolled their lowest game of the
season. Williams of the Law School
five hit 212 in this game to add
insult to injury. in the finale. the
squad returned to thcir old form
and tumbled the lumber for a total
of 914 pins. Hank F‘ai'lcy‘s smashing
229 was the big gun in the attack.

The 229 game rolled by Farlcy was
the outstanding individual effort of
the evening, although Bob Dickin-
son crashed the 500 circle with a
neat 515. Newcomer Mikc LuManna
led the statesmen in the first game
with a total of 197.

While the State quintet was los—
ing ground in the race for first
place. RPI swept three to tukc un-
disputed possession of the numbcr
