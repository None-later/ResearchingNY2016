Rumor had it that AD had con-
sidered the possibility of not doing
Dan Rider's play of last Tuesday
night. A few of the members felt
that the play ll’llgllt be objection<
able to sotne of the audience. How-
ever. tvc feel that those of us who
were in the audience were very
phased to see that the old “bug—a-
boo" of sex on our stage wont down
to defeat. The over—all performance
was as stimulating as it was enter-
aining‘. There is no doubt in our
mind that the point tor moral, if
you willi of the play was made
very evident by a competent. inter-
pretation oi the director and cast.

The philosophy of lilxistentional-
ism requires an expert's interpreta-
tion in order to come within the
layman‘s grasp. and c~.ei'_\‘:liiiig con-
nected with Satre. the high lama
of this cult. is a difficult. undertak—
ing. Therefore. it is with great
pride that we point to Dan Rider
and the excellent cast llt‘ chose. for

striking and as unusual as the plot
of the play itself; lighting effects
were well-timed and used only in
appropriate spots.

Platidits go to Roz Lacks, Tony
Prochllo. and Caroline Williams.
not. only for tackling these exacting
roles but also for portraying them
with an almost professional ﬁnish.

Dari Rider must know that no
better compliment can be paid him
other than that which the audience
gave through their complete ab-
sorption and appreciative applause.
