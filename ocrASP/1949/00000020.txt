How About It . . .

It’s about time we started individual introspec-
tion and started evolving the “little wheel” under
our own individual volitions. We’ve had our ears
beaten almost to indifference by similar words.
But how about a little investigation before going
to assembly and listening to voluminous power-
politic speeches and making decisions on the emo-
tional appeal or repugnance of the words of others.

Then-pending PRTTSAC‘” presents a first-rate
opportunity for the suave characters to sway the
mobs with their smooth, fast talk. That type of
legislation may be tolerated in a place where the
power of the printing press is limited. Here Ill
the U. S., State College in particular, we don‘t have
to reso'rt to it. On the following pages of the
NEWS, you will find the PRTTSAC printed for
you to read, so you can analyze it for yourself.
Student Council has purchased the space so you
can read the proposed revisions, and determine
its merit's and fallacies on your own.

There will be much pressure from both sides,
as there always is. Form your own pressure group
within yourself. If you read the I‘RTTSAC as
here set forth, you’ll know as much about the
whole affair as anyone else does. Don‘t let them
fool you into thinking otherwise.

If the proposed revision is brought tip in as-
embly today it must be tabled for a week before
discussion. Use the week proﬁtably to do a little
investigation and thinking of your own. Go into
assembly next Friday with your course determined
and don‘t waver.

But let's broaden our perspective. The
l’RTTSAC is a minor part of your human exist-
ence. In fact just how much of what you're do-
ing today are you going to find of value to you
twenty years hence? In other words has your
present activity any relation to your future?
Which will be of more value to you, rivalry acti—
vities or “81A? Which give you more sense of
satisfaction, State I’air or your work with
SMILES.“ Think it over. Are yott analyzing your
life as you should analyze the l’l{'l"i‘.\‘:\('? If
not there‘s something wrong. You have the privi-
lege of determining your own life just as you have
the privilege of making your decision on the pro-
posed revision. Just as you can form your opinion
of the right course to pursue concerning the (‘on-
stittttion, you can make your life what you want
it to he, not what others think it should be.

You are the Master of your fate. and the (‘ap-
tain of your soul. \\'hatcver course you pursue.
stick to it. \\'haicver happens. come out with
your feet firmly planted and say “cheese”.

w. _..._. By TOM

On Friday morning all the little
democratic delinquents were herd-
ed into Page Hall. and the doors
bolted by Pless’ Peasants. as usual.
This was not unusual since the
democratic delinquents are herded
into Page Hall and the doors bolted
by Pless' Peasants every Friday.
However, it was not long before
it became quite evident that this

was not just anothdn assembly. for

when it came time for “God Save
the Dean,” the hummleader, Miss
Bosh, approached the podium with
a shiny new beryllium bazookal Its
magic tones touched the delin-
quents’ little hearts and hammered
on their little eardrums. and hid
the fact that many of them still
had not learned the words to “God
Save the Dean.” .

As soon as the song was ended,
The Stool (so-called for the posi—
tion he occupies on the stage)
stamped his foot for order. and an—
nounced that the Committee for
Determining a Suitable Memorial
for Those Unfortunates Killed in
Pushball would make their report.
The first speaker. Mr. Sparkle
Plenty, roller-skated to the front
of the stage.

"We could get a $1.000.000 gov—
ernment bond for $100. but that‘s
ridiculous," and he sat down. Mr.
Ho Hee Ho. the second speaker.
shuffled out in a clown suit and
everybody laughed. so he sat down
too. Then Sparkle Plenty re—roller—
skated to the front of the stage.
“We can buy a gargoyle that looks
like the coach and spouts cham-
pagne through its nose. but not
everyone likes champagne, so that's
out." No one laughed at this be-
cause they knew it was true. Then
Miss Bosh sauntered sexily to the
center of the stage caressing her
beryllium bazooka, and a wild cheer
went up from Sparkle. Ho Hee Ho.
and the members of the Bazooka
Board in the audience. At this sig-
nal. Myskania Birds [lapped their
wings and soared around Page Hall,
showering ballots on the popttluce
below. A communist asked The
Stool if there was going to be any
discussion, and The Stool reluc-
tantly admitted there was a possi-
bility of such. Suddenly. ever-ready

ing at Miss Bosh.

O’BRIEN
Milly Mitt came sliding down her
ﬂreman’s pole to the center of the
stage.

“I recommend we erect an out-
house in memory of those who died
so ignominiously on the pushball
field." she shouted. . .

“Good Lord," muttered Ho Hee
Ho. 4

"Don’t call me names," rotor-ted
Millie.

“Address your remarks to the
Stool." interrupted The Stool who
was quite hurt that he had been
ignored for some time. Ho Hee Ho

shoe with which he stamps for ord-
er. (indicating he was making be-
lieve he was somebody else) and
told the objector to shut-the-hell-

his shoe.

To the Editor:

People are beginning to take
sides on a biting issucrthc new
constitution There are those who
would reject. it from conservative
convictions, a few who find that
the proposal does not satisfy their
most liberal standards. The para-
dox of such a situation is indicative
of the weight of thought necessary
to act wisely on a very important
matter.

There are only a few assemblies
left this semester, and there is still
a budget to be considered. The
Constitutional "Revision" Commit.-
t.ee may propose that. the budget be
put aside until after Moving-Up
Day after the new govermnt it
takes office. Such procedtire. which
I find higth impractical. would ul-
so be unfair to the time and effort
which the committee has devoted
to its work.

i have studied the plan very
carefully and tutvc found the mem-
bcrs of the committee most coop-
erative in considering new sugges-

tions lint. the business of details "

has beeti. of necessity. endlessly
ttinc consuming Ilil(l the proposed
constitution is still far from ner-
t‘eet.. The measure cannot be treat-
ed lightly. I think botli liberal and
conservative will agree that. new
constitutions simply are not adopt—
ed cvcry secoitd or third year.

()in' present constitution does
need revision ill some iiistunees it
is weak enough that one might be
tempted to consider replacing ll.
lint the basic structure is sound
tully as sound as the .stiii faulty
proposed constitution.

i make only one plea. [in not
4ch way to needless pressure which
proponents oi the new constitution
may exert. ’l‘licre. simply isn't time
this semester to consider the coin-
tuittec's work luirly. Wiicu the new
constitution is presented to Student.
Association for a vote. I urge that.

its nicritable parts may be put be—
fore the student body early next
semester.

Each year we iiiid ottr agenda
loaded as time grows shorter. And
all of us call well remetnber pur—
t.icular instances in which we acted
under too great a pressure. Later
we found it necessary to reconsider
our undue haste.

If We feel a pressure on the is-
sue of a new constitution. it may
be largely artificial. The recent tin-
orthodox assemblies could be
enough to turn the screw. llutthink
back a year. two years confusion
in assembly has been unique with
this year‘s administration. not with
this system of gmcrntnent. If both
the student tulministrution and the
student body at large would strive
for closer cooperation within otir
present system oi government,
much of the confusion iand pres-
sure!» would be eliminated.

As a general comment. on a dent—
ocrutic system of imvernmcnt
tiiere will always be attempts to
reform" by those who cannot be-
collie accustomed to doing things
by committee. discussion. voting,
etc. It is foolhurdy to ptit llll Illi-
dtie preiiiliiiii on "efficiency" let‘s
not eliminate altogether the neces-
sity ior all-student participation.
There is u very practical point to
reineini.)cr. 'i‘he tnorc power stu«
dents have over their own affairs.
the more interest ill tiicin exists. I
know of no other college or lilll-
\‘i‘l'ally which hits as Iiiin a pro-
portion oi student partictpution in
such things as Art, Music, lllt‘l'li‘
ttll'c. publications and community
ciiairs. The simple ways oi gcliltii;
work rtoiic are not always the. best.
When the going is easy, it is oitcii
down-lull.

The Common-Stator is given the widest latitude as
author of this column, although his viewpoints do
not necessarily reflect those of the STATE Common
NEWS.

ATTENTION, CRC.

Since the Constitutional Revision Program is go-
ing into its last stages, a few minor changes regarding
the Student Board of Finance would be beneficial
to the Board.

One would be to llinlt membership on the board
to Commerce students. Since a great deal of the
Board’s work has to do with bookkeeping, this seems
like a wise request.

And there should be some clarification on the re—
fund of the Student Fee if a person leaves school
during the. year.

BROPIIY SAYS . . .

that there was more harmony in assembly
last week than has been seen for many a Friday
morning. The Queens of Harmony really have a lot
on the apple.

SENIORS

If you're worried about a job and if the type of
work appeals to you. there is an ever expanding
field in the teaching of handicapped children The
N. Y. Times of March 2 outlined the situation and
the dire need for workers.

If you're interested in specialized training for
such work, both Syracuse and Buffalo State T‘llCllt‘l‘S
are supposed to have line courses for this kind of
teaching.

FOR WIIOM ’l‘llE BELL ’I‘OLLS

The old gripe. that instructors are holding their
classes after the bell rings has cropped up again.
As usual. it is particularly noticed in Richardson.
where the between-period break is taken up by trav-
eling three flights of congested stairways.

STUDENT LOAN FIINI)

Although the WMC gave the impression that. every—
thing was jake with the student loan funds. there
is a group tdirected by Student Councili that is
looking into the situation . . . not, on a war inc-
mortal basis though. There is need for a general
fund that. will not have the limitations that the
present. ones have.

SMILES . . .
it is rtunorcd. is trying to get into Student
Association . . . with corresponding financial support
under the budget Smiles does some fine work. but.
some of its members feel that the lack of organiza-
tion in Smiles would make the more an unwise one.
Opposition also comes froin those who feel that
there is a duplication of work between Smiles and
Mic. The All-State Community Service. set up n
few months ago. was to do away with some of this
duplication.

a study of traffic conditions llt'ttl' the college. Wash—
ington Avenue. right behind Draper flat]. is a par-
ticularly dangerous crossing as is the intersection
at. Western Avenue arid State Street.

Ht‘AUS

State College Association of Graduate Students
is going before Student Association this morning to
ask for an appropriation of $100. One of the tin-
porthnt things to remember when voting on the mo—
tion is that the grads had no voice in determining
the budget last year. They merely payed tlte icc
set by the administration on the advice of the Stu-
dent. Board of Finance.

This $100 is only for this year. The grad organi—
nation has plans to make itself self—supporting next
year. It is a new organization that will grow in
the next. few years with the five year requirement
for certification. ’l‘his $ltlli would give them a lilt't'
boost. and wouldn‘t be hurting the Association‘s
pocketbook too inttcli.

Poll ReVeals Student Preference

To go or not to go. Sometimes,

——well, it was a choice-facing Stu-
dent Association ln a poll recently
conducted by the State College
NEWS. Comments received on the
ballots cast in last week's assembly
on the subject of whether or not
students would attend if assemblies
were not compulsory or if they Were
held on Wednesday nights (this is
a purely hypothetical case, you un-
derstandi constituted the most en—
lightening fenture of the poll. These
ranged from four emphatic exclam-
ation points after the “No” for
Wednesday night attendance to
"Always" on Friday mornings “if
they were a little more mature and
less of a personal clash between
certain members of S.A."

Statistical results of the poll show
790 votes were cast. Out of the 102
of those who voted always for Fri-
day assembly, 1'? voted yes and 29,
no, to Wednesday evening attend-
ance. There were two blanks. Out
of the 643 who voted sometimes to
Friday assembly, 68 voted yes, 9
sometimes. and 561 no to Wednes-
day evening. There were five blanks.
Out of 41 who voted never to Fri-
day, one voted yes and 38 no to

tinned. The general consensus of
opinion was not in favor of Wed-
nesday evening. In fact, violent re-
actions of “Impossible. people work
nights for bread and butter,"
“Sometimes. but not during Lent."
"Think of the poor commuters!"
were voiced. Others mentioned the
fact that Junior Methods is sched-
uled for eight o’clock Thursday
morning and other meetings are
often slated for Wednesday evening.

On attending Friday morning as-
semblies, if they were not compul-
sory, opinions varied from “Always.
I enjoy assemblies" to “Sometimes,
depending on the smoothness of
operation in procedures" to "Never,
if they Were as they are now."

Constructive criticism was also
voiced with the comment. "I think
compulsory attendance twice a
month is a better idea. This would
leave two other periods- free for
homework and lunch."

Submit Budgets,
Pay Student Tax

All students who entered in Jan—
uary, and have not yet purchased
their Student Tax Ticket. are ask-
ed to report to Dr. Edward L. Coop-
er‘s office. third floor Draper to
make this purchase. Graduate
tickets are priced at $3.50 and un—
dergraduate tickets at $8.50.

Seniors and Graduate students
who have not, as yet, paid their
diploma fee of $4.00, are asked to
report to Dr. Cooper‘s office to do
so.
