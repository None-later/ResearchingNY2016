To the Ediotr:

As a result of considerable agita-
tion for constitutional study and
amendment. a committee was ap-
pointed and so directed. After near-
ly a year of work that committee
has a completed report to be sub-
mitted to the Student Association.
This report is the result of not only
the committee's work. but also of
open hearings at which major
changes were initiated. Some of
these were: decision to exclude a
discontinuance of the preferential
voting system, decision to leave el-
igibility for the judicial branch
open to all persons not holding
other Student Association ofﬁces.
and several minor changes.

There is some question concern-
ing the best time to consider these
extensive amendments. The ele-
ment of time is an important one
D e c a u s c careful consideration
should be given the report before
a ﬁnal vote is taken. If this report
were postponed until next year. it
would have to be done in one or
two ways. The first would be to vote
on it as soon as would be expedient
and put it into immediate effect
if favorably accepted. This would
be a very undesirable situation in-
volving many extensive elections
and the loss of ofﬁce by many dc-
scrving people. A second possibility
would be to present the report as
soon as expedient with the provi-
sion that it would go into effect on
the following Moving-Up Duy. This
also would lead to an unhealthy
situation by providing a loss of
faith and subsequent morul disin-
tcgrution.

The very best time to enact 3.7V
wide scule change is during thI..
time of year. Moving-Up Day will
be May 14: The budget discussion
could, if necessary be curried over

until after that date. There is ad-
equate time for thought and dis-
cussion if the student body will read
the proposed changes. think and
discuss them constructively and
carry on an informed discussion in
open meeting of the Student As-
scmbly.
