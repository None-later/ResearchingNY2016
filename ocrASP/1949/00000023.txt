Merchandising Class Draws Fashion Conclusions
From Recent, Unofficial Stale Student Survey

By DOROTHY MANN

Last week the clothing of State
College students was carefully sur-
veyed by certain members of a
merchandising class. Although not
every member of the student body
was given a chance, certain con-
clusions with regard to the dress
of undergraduates were drawn.

Now we know, without room for
question, that 86 per cent of the
women on campus have the "new"
look, which was indoctrinated a
year ago, and 14 per cent still hold
to the “old” look. Since none of
the subjects was questioned, it is
not known whether this is due to
lack of funds or real fidelity to the

garb known in youth.

No per cent of our men have that
“hold” look. This is not to cast as-
persion, but rather only to report
the results of the clothing survey.

Starting with the girls, from their
pointed little heads down to their
painted crooked toes, we ﬁnd that
66 2/3 per cent of them Wear either
full or side bangs. This may be due
to a lack of forehead or an over-
abundance hair, and 57 per cent
have long. Sweaters are worn fre-
quently by a majority, and of these
55 per cent were the pull-over type,
and 45 per cent cardigan. 15 per
cent of the pull-overs were short-
sleeved sweaters. It is also a fact,
surprisingly enough, that more
sweaters were seen in the Library
than anywhere else.

For some reason, not stated in
the poll, and unlikely to be found
in writing anywhere else, girls pre-
fer. by a ratio of 3:1. blouses which
button down the front, rather than
down the back. Plaid and grey
skirts rank ﬁrst and second. re-
spectively on campus.

Shoulder-scrap bags are the most
popular, and approximately 60 per
cent wear black suede shoes rather
than any other type of footWear.

As for the men, 40 per cent wear
no ties at all. and of those who do,
large. colored design ties are most
frequently seen. White shirts are
most popular with upperclassmen,
and are usually worn with suits.
Sport shirts are far more popular
than colored dress shirts. Approxi-
mately 32 per cent of our men wear
sweaters regularly to school.

A survey of men’s socks shows
that 66 2/3 per cent Wear argyle
and 14 per cent wear white wool.
The abundance of argyle would be
backed up by the number of knit-
ting bags being carried by the wo-
men. Brown leather shoes are worn
by the men more than any other
color shoe. Two men were seen
wearing white bucks, and only one
was seen with saddles.

Operetta Thrills Audience,   
Constitution in Assembly

Proves "Howling" Success

Amid the clashing of swords
and sighs of the fair maidens,
the audience sat enthralled at
the performance taking place
on the stage last Friday and
Saturday nights. The “Pirates of
Penzance” was being given, and
the players fell into the spirit
with gusto, cracking jokes on
the stage and having a merry,
swashbuckling time. The sing-
ers strained their vocal cords
in an admirable fashion (al-
though Mills had a cold) and
everyone seemed to have a won-
derful time scaring each other
or blushing with maidenly mod-
esty.

The audience sat with rapt
attention, even when the scen-
cry started falling down. and
the dust from the floorboards
floated out to impair their vi-
sion. After it was over every-
one held the some idea—that it
was wonderful.
