"Dust Off Your Manners”
Says Texan Feature Writer

Attention, State men and
women. Are you in the know?
When Professor Smiley Schmatz
comes to dinner at your house,
do you introduce him to your
favorite housemother with
“Schmatz, this is Nautz, our
ruling hand?” According to a
feature writer of the "Daily
Lass-o” of Denton, Texas, in-
troduction “know how" is a nec-
essary thing in everyday living.
This writer also gives hints
about dating. Women, do you
keep your men waiting on dates?
You shouldn't. according to this
expert; you may be in danger
of losing him to that cute
blonde down the street! Don’t
throw rotten eggs at your man
by means of sarcastic remarks!
Instead of capitalizing on his
faults. praise his good points
and toss a few bouquets

EEP Takes Two,
Bulls Win One

In Cage Leagues

Thursday afternoon, March 10th.
Potter continued their romping by
taking the SL5 quintet, 50-15. With
the scoring well-divided among the
big men, Klopeful threw in 11 to
lead the way. In another free-
scoring contest for Potter, they took
measure of the Fillks on Satur-
day with 60 counters to 23. Mc-
Grath's 16 was high for this con-
test.

tinued their winning ways by giv-
ing the cellar—holding Scrubs a wal-
loping‘, 42-20. N-cil Ryder put in 11
for the winners. The closest game
was a tight battle between the Car—
pctbaggers and the Angels. In a
three-minute overtime period the
Bags finally pulled away to win,
40-37. With seconds to go Frail set
one to tie the score but the Carpet-
baggcrs tossed in six to the Angels'
3 in the three minutes.

Varsity Bowlers
Down ABC Five

Wednesday night the slipping
State Bowling quintet broke the ice.
and took two out of three games
from ABC in the Intercollegiate
League. In the meantime, Slena
trounced the league-leading Engi-
neers from REI twice to slice their
six game lead. As a result of their
two victories. the statesmen gained
a full game in their drive for first
place. The standings at the present
time give the Engineers a five-game
advantage over their nearest com-
petitors, the second place States-
men. In th.rd place, five games be-
hind the teachers are two teams all
tied up with thirty-five wins each.
Slena and Pharmacy. The Pharma-
cists have a postponed match to
roll off. so if they could win these
three games, they could provide
dangerous competition for second
place.

For the first time in several
weeks. four of the statesmen rolled
500 or better. Joe Carosella led the
squad by putting tog-ether games
of 185. 168. and 176 for a 529 total
Ton pins behind was Bob Dickin-
son with a total of 519. His single
of 196 was high in that department
for thc teachers, although Domin-
clli of ABC had a 241. Hank Farlcy
with 512. and Don McDonald with
508 wore the others who l'Oll‘l‘tl over
the 500 mark.

The aforementioned Dominclli
was the lad who spcllcd def-eat for
the Varsity in tho second game. His
241 eugid the Statcsincn by it nar-
row margin 01' eleven pins. 833-872.
Paliumidis, the ABC boy who bowl-
ed 299 a few weeks ago, contributed
a 205 slnglc in the sccond tilt and
ll 574 total.

cht \\'cck, the Varsity is schedul-
cd to mcct Siena. Only four weeks
of too playing schedule remain, so
all bllOSt' who can spare a Wed—
nesday evening are urged to turn
out and support tho team in their
last t\\'cl\'c games.

__By PAUL BUCHMAN—

Day after day, newspapers carry
reports of close, thrilling basketball
games that were won by the ad-
vantage one of the ball clubs had
wiih a “big” man. In no other sport
does a player hold such a distinct
physical asset that the tall man,
with his extra height, does in the
close game. Control of the back-
boards, essential to "winning bas-
ketball." height on jump-ups, and
the all-important tap-ins, are all of
great consequence in inking up ball
games on the “won” side of the
ledger.

Typical of the big men in the
game. Ed Matthews, tallest player
on the "purple and gold' squad, is
a gangling. six foot three inch
giant. When the powers-that-be
sent out a call for men early in
November. "Big Ed" reported and
promptly made the Varsity. Mat-
thcws. although new at the school
(he transferred this year from
Drcxcl Institute of Technology) be-
came widely known for his work on
the ball club.

The boy from St. Mary's Park
uscs a varied assortment of shots
lo good advantage. Playing out of
the bucket. he feeds off easily and
smoothly. and shoots a machine-
liko hook shot and a. spectacular
twa-handcd jump shot. Not partic-
ularly fast afoot. and perhaps a
t1‘.llc awkward, (which, sadly, is a
defect peculiar to most tall men)
Mnttlchs more than makes up for
this lack of coordination by stretch-
ing his big frame ovcr ball players
of lcsscr slature.

Matlhcws was one of the work-
horscs of the team, because he
drc:s_d for both Varsity and Junior
Varsity games. This meant that he
often was in uniform for almost
four hours at a stretch. During
pi'iicticc hc frequenin became a
gunca-pig. guarding the starting
c.nicr while Coach Hathaway 1n-
iroduc-cd a new play. or drilled the
team on correcting their mistakes.

“Big Ed" is a member of the
Sophomore class. He sends his let-
ters home to Foughkeepsie, New
York.

About Basketball

The 1948-49 Basketball Campaign
came to a close last March 9 with
a victory over Triple Cities College,

53-52. It was a brilliant climax with.

State winning in the last seconds
of play.

The past season wasn't a partic-
ularly successful season in the won-
lost column but, quoting Coach
Hathaway, “It was an enjoyable
one." State faceo‘ many opponents
out of their class but did unusually
well against them. Losing to Pratt
and Maritime Academy by four
points on the Page Hall court show-
ed that the “Peds” were not to be
under-estimated.

Team Started Slowly

State started the season rather
slowly having difficulty with offen-
sxve and defensive play, .but as the
season progressed the “Peds” im-
proved in both departments. A
starting combination presented dif-
ficulties to Coach Hathaway early
in the campaign. but as the season
moved on, Fersh, O‘Brien, Brown.
Warden, and Marzello usually start-
cd each game.

The end of the season two new-
comers began to fit into the Coach's
plan, Marks and Kaehn, and gave
the team an added scoring punch.
The loss of Captain Kenny George
early in the season proved to be
a handicap to the “Fed's.” Kenny
was well respected for shooting
ability as well as his fine defensive
play.

On the statistical side of the game
State did fairly well. They scored
a total of 1126 points as against a
1332 total for opponents for 21
games. In the individual column Sy
Fersh led the “Feds” with a total
of 277 points for 13.85 average in
twenty games. Tom O'Brien netted
185 points for the season and a 8.81
average per game. In the foul shoot-
ing department. “Linc” Marzello
converted 20 out of 27 free throws
for a .741 average. Fersh followed
with 73 out of 110 for a .663 average.

Two Things

 

was/la

By , PAT JAI

The bowling league rolled on this
week as three more games were
played last Monday. The Newman-
Cnl Sig game resulted in a win for
each team. A forfeit by Wren gave
iEierce two more victories. The frosh
gained tw0 more wins as BZ also
iorfeited. In individual scoring Mary
Jane Perls is high with 134.2, fol-
lowed by Lee Cheatham with 127.7
and Wilma Whitney 127.3.

Ping Pong

Any girls wishing to play in the
doubles tournament should sign up
on the sheet which is on the WAA
bulletin board. This must be done
by Friday as that is the last day
the sheet will be up. Girls should
also check as to the number of
hours they have played at this
time.

Basketball

Girls’ basketball was played Sat-
urday, Tuesday and Wednesday.
Saturday's games resulted in only
two being played. BZ defeated
Saylcs by a 10-2 score. A walk-
away was won by Sayles A over Psi
Gain. 25-2.

Three forfeits occurred Tuesday
night. AEPhl. Chi Sigma and Com-
muters forfeited to Sayles B, Kappa
Delta and Gamma Kap. The closest
game of the evening was between
Fierce A and Western. The spirited
Western team held the Pierce girls
down to a three point lead and the
filial score was 17-14. Phi Delta
downed Pierce B in the final game
of the evening, 23-7.

Wednesday night was a surprise.
Pierce A played Sayles B and won
17—11. Kappa Delta defeated New-
man by a 22-2 score. After the Com-
muters forfeited to Sayles A, Psi
Gamma played Chi Sig with only
five players against six for Chi Sig.
Fsi Gam won by a 17-16 score. The
last game of the evening was be-
tween Beta Zeta and Phi Delta.
The seldom defeated Phi Delta team
was conquered in a very close game
by a 11-10 score.
