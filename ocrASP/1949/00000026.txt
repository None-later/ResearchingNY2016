Conducts Night Classes At SCT

A new feature of the night
classes taught .at State College is
the series of courses recently intro-
duced as extension courses under
the supervision of the New York
State School of Industrial and La-
bor Relations of Cornell University.

Conducted more or less on an
informal basis, the courses include
discussions of Current Labor-Man-
agement News, the Role of the Fore-
man in Employee Relations, and
other topics pertaining to Labor
Relations. These classes are open
to the general public, labor groups.
and employers, and a certificate is
issued to anyone who attends 60%
of the meetings.

The history of the Labor Rela-
tions School dates back to 1944.
when it was authorized by an act
of the New York State Legislature.
The School began instruction at
Cornell University on November 5,
1945. It operates through three ma-
jor functional divisions: (1) resi-
dent undergraduate and graduate
instruction, (2) extension teaching,
and (3) research and information.
The Extension Division started its
operations late in 1946.

Among the courses listed, which

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

are offered on Monday and Tuesday
nights from 8 pm. to 9:30 pm, until
March 29, is one dealing with Cur-
rent Labor-Management News,
which analyzes current develop-
ments in industrial and labor rela-
tions as reported in sources of news
information. Current discussions
have dealt mainly with the Taft-
Hartley Act. Another course listed
is the Administration of Collective
Bargaining Contracts, which is led
by Mr. John A. Rooney, Commis-
sioner of the Federal Mediation and
Conciliation Service. Mr. Rooney.
who - was recently active in the
strike settlement in Schenectady,
sets up various situations each week,
with the solution being worked out
separately by groups representing
labor, employers, and consumers,
and the r suits then being discussed
by the entire class. -

Other courses offered also include
discussions on Working Under Col-
lective Bargaining Agreements, and
Industrial Accident Prevention, both
of which are led by officials who
are actively engaged in the field of
labor and mediation in New York
State.

“Story Hour," under the supervi-
sion of Miss Marian Hastings, As-
sistant College Librarian, is held
every week in connection with the
Clinton 8 q u a re Neighborhood
House. Under the specialized pro-
grams, stories are told by Miss Hast-
ings and volunteer students and
the children are allowed to act
tnem out. Puppet shows are pre—
sented and the children are en-
couraged in self-expression by tell-
ing their own stories.

According to Goldman, “Com—
munity Service is excellent training
for people aspiring to teach. It is
a basis for learning how to work
with groups. Not only docs the work-
cr benefit. but. the children who are
helped by the program learn to
know the teachers that they will
someday have. Not only do you
teach but you also help the chil--
dren to understand themselves as.
a group and by doing so. give them
a basis for life as an individual as
well as in a group."

This group is opened to anyone
who would like to work on a vol-
unteer basis. Clerical workers are
needed especially. Since the initia-
tion of this program. the enroll—
mom. in the community houses has
more than doubled. '

Keller Writes,

Produces Satire
For '51 Big Four
Will Feature Thorne,

Freedman Music Score

“For Heaven's Sake," the Sopho-
more Big-4 production, will be held
tomorrow night in the Page Hall
auditorium at 8:30 p. m. This fan-
tasy, satirizing the inability of hu-
mans to settle petty differences,
was written and directed by Walter
E. Keller who was assisted by 1131in-
lis Harris, general chairman of the
Big-4 presentation.

The locale of the satire is heaven,
and the plot' revolves around a bit-
ter controversy between angels
wearing gold halos and those wear-
ing platinum halos. Both factions,
though equal in every respect, main-
tain a constant argument as to
which group God prefers.
Dissension Reaches Climax

Donald Ely as Tam, the rabble-
rouser of the platiniun—haloed an-
gels, and Frederic Knoerzer. as Mat
of the golden—indeed angels, after
having a stormy dispute, return to
their groups and stir them to anger.
The angels rally back and forth,
resulting in the issuance of strict
injunctions against each other.
These harsh rulings full drastically
upon Jane Cook. as Tyresa, and
Eugene Webster, as Tyrone. the two
happy lovers. And thus unfolds the
plot.

Production Features Orchestra

Among the special features of the
show is an orchestra directed by
Joan Whitcrafi. Orchestra members
are Richard Thorne, Donald Mc-
Donald. William Reynolds. Michael
Lamanna, Donald Burt, mid Ed-
ward Thomson. The music com-
posed especially i‘or the show by
Richard Thorne is “I Love You So,”
“My Gal Is Mine." and "I‘m Going
Up to Heaven." Joseph Frecdman‘s
original is “Angel‘s Waltz." Lyrics
