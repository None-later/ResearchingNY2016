DropTwo Games,
Still Hold Second

Wednesday night, the Varsity
bowling squad lost an excellent op-
portunity to gain ground in their
drive for first place in the Inter-
collegiate league. By dropping two
out of three games to the rejuven-
ated Indians from Siena. the
statesmen failed to capitalize on
RPI's loss to Pharmacy. The Engin-
eers did manage to wrap up one
victory to protect their five game
lead over the Teachers.

Wednesday’s match was a hip
and tuck battle all the way. In the
ﬁrst encounter. Sicna, sparked by
anchor man Parks’ 214 single, came
out on top by a slim margin of
fourteen pins. The second game
provided a closer ﬁnish as the In—
dians edged the statesmen by elev-
en pins. But the ﬁnale proved to be
the most thrilling outcome of all as
the Varsity came from behind to
nip the lads from Loundonville by
a mere four pins, 795-791.

By putting together games of 165-
161—182 for a total of 508. Joe Car—
osella stole the individual honors
of the evening. Fran Mullin was a
very close second with an even 500
for his three game efforts. Carosel—
la‘s 182 was also the high single for
the statesmen.

The remaining league activity
was conﬁned to the ABC-Law
School match which was decided in
ABC's favor. 3-0.

Practice Sioris

Varsity Baseball practice got un~
dcr way Wednesday afternoon with
a turn out of twenty-four men. Ten
of those out are veterans from last
year‘s squad. The pitchers back
from last year are Ciearwater and
Santora. They will be supported by
several promising newcomers with
Ainlaw, Eich, Marks, Orner, Peene,
and ’I‘auroney leading the list.
Most of these men have had previ-
ous experience as pitchers in high
school or during the summer ses-
sion. Stevenson is back for the po-
stion of catcher with a couple of
other potentials. Zanchelli and
Marks look to be the outstanding
substitutes for the position. Carter
and Monroe are both back to fill
the 2nd base position as are Duf-
fus and Englehart for the short-
stop spot. Marzello is back for the
infield position on the team and
will be backed up by a couple of
veterans, Kaehn and McDonald. in
the outfield. Others out for this post
are Colpovs and Sonberg. The big—
gist job facing the Coach in form-
ing the team will be in picking a
1st and 3rd basemen. Men out for
the team who look promising for
these positions are Yole. Rutley.
an‘i Sanderson. It is still pretty
early to tell just what kind of a
team we'll have this year. but the
prospects are good with so much
material to choose from.

Coach Hathaway will be assisted
in the coaching of the team this
year by Farley and Dickinson; both
Grads who were on the team last
year. They will alternate nights for
the bractice sessions so that Coach
will have time to devote to the
tennis and golf teams.

Several of last year‘s squad will
not be back with us. George, our
center fielder. can't make it. Ward-
en will be absent from first. and
F‘nr‘cy will no longer be on the
mound. George Glcnday who was
hurl rcccntly in basketball will not
be out ."or the team for some time.
but we look forward to his return.

Mixed Doubles To Bowl

The mide double bowling tour-
nament will be held on Wednesday,
March 30. at Ricc‘s. It is open to all
students and will be on a handicap
basis. All those who wish to bowl
may sign up on the MAA or WAA
bulletin boards. Bowling will start
at. 4 p. m., but. those with 3:30 pm.

"A" League Title

With the IM basketball season's
finish around the corner Potter
once again has walked off with the
“A” league title, while the Bulls
and Beavers are battling it out for
the “B” league’s title.

By crushing KDR 52—28 EEP
went through another season un-
defeated. Fran Mullin was the top
man with 17 while Jerry Dunn hit
for 11 in a losing cause. Also on
Saturday the Redskins dropped one
to the Coughdrops 32-16 as Ryder
racked up 11. The Bulls continued
their winning ways by beating the
Mightymites in the day's closer.

On Monday night SLS took the
Carpetbaggers 41-37, in a. fast mov-
ing game that saw Dicks and Wy—
lier ﬁght it out for scoring honors.
Dicks came out on top by scoring
19 to Wylier‘s 14. The fast break-
ing and alertness of SLS proved
to be too much for the slower Car-
petbaggers.

Following this game the Mighty-
inites paced by Dombrowski's 11
points beat the Scrubs 25—17. The
Scrubs‘ points were evenly divided
with no one scoring more than four.

Another close game ended the
night as the Redskins nosed out
the Lovers by one point. 26-25.
White and Miller each scored 8 for
the Skins and Rutlcy tossed in 10
for the Lovers.

The remainder of the season's
games are as follows:
