"Ponclr Requests Cards
For Children In Home

SMILES is sponsoring a birthday
card campaign for the children at
the Albany Home for Children. Ac-
cording to Susan Panek ’51 a poster
will be put up in the peristyle be-
tween the Commons and Draper
announcing the birthday dates—
ages—names, etc. This campaign,
which will be initiated next week,
will continue throughout the re-
mainder of the semester.

Each week SMILES will post a
list of the birthdays for the follow-
ing week. MISS Panek speaking on
behalf of SMILES urges States
students to send cards: “You
who have birthdays while you are
away from home, and when no one
——either from home or from school
—remem.b.ers your birthday, or even
so much as wishes you a Happy
Birthday, how do you feel? Prob-
ably none of you have undergone
such an experience. But think back
to the days when you were but
‘kids.’ Remember how much the
birthday cake, the small birthday
presents. the fuss and bother made
over you, meant to you! Send
some children birthday cards;
Bring joy into the lives of others;
Remember others as you would
wish to be remembered."

 

Starlight, Stardust Highlight
Sayles, 82 Dance Themes

Starlight. starbright, where
shall we shine tonight? That
must have been the dilemma fac-
ing the heavenly bodies (stars,
that IS) last Saturday night. But
the starry atmosphere prevailing
over both the Sayles Hall and
BZ formals showed that the
problem had been solved without
partiality.

Under a canopy of blue stream-
ers and “celestial twinklers“
couples at Sayles Hall Formal
danced to the strains of soft
music rendered by Freddy Grey’s
orchestra. And in the Lounge,
132 reflected the glow as Harry
Littler and his orchestra added to
the general theme.

In keeping with the astrologic
effect, programs sprinkled with
stars were given at each formal.
Engraved match books were pre-
sented to the guests of the Sayles
women. The very atmosphere of
both formals seemed to send
forth a "breath of spring" which
came in officially the next day!

Spring—soft muslc~~soft lights
—and the stars. what more could
be asked for?

“Brooklyn is Swamped" read the
headline on page 8, so we continued
a little further down the page. It
turned out that the story happened
to be about basketball, and before
we reached the end of the column,
we had learned that State College
administered the licking, and was
to face Long Island University the
following week. a game ,which
would see a team who had won 36
out of 44 play for the last time.

It all appeared in the issue of
the State College NEWS for Febru-
ary 1, 1929, but it was enough to
make us curious, so we delved fur-
ther baclz In the ﬁles to see what
had been headline news ten, twenty,
or thirty years ago.

The first thing that struck our
eye was one which brings back
memories of events of the not-so-
far-back past. There before Us was
the story in black and white—
“Myskanla Decision to Start Con-
flict." The truth developed, how—
ever, that it was only the annual
banner hunt, which was slated for
the middle of December, 1929.

Thinking of the advertisers, our
glance soon fell on the ad which
announced “The Silent Drama—all
day, 3.25;”, After the show, our
thoughts immediately turned to a
cup of coffee, but we were last, until
our eye lit on a bold announcement
by “The Boulevard Cafeteria and
grill." “

Being forced to face the problems
of the day, our attention was at-
tracted by the two-column story,
which was headed with the startl-
ing words “Student Tax to Soar to
$13 if Budget is Passed Today."
This one interested us, so we pro-
ceeded to digest the content, and
found that the budget for the year
1929-30 called for an outlay of
nearly $2,000 more than had been
expended the year before. Increases
were due to a rise in the request of
D and A to enable them to bring,
among other guest artists, “a play-
wright. Michael Strange, divorcee
of John Barrymore.”

All in all, it appears that we are
beset by the same troubles today
as were our predecessors by twenty
years.

An off stage chorus. under the
