Don't Vote - - -

Students of State College, the situation is ser-
ious. No one is satisﬁed with the present set-up.
The janitors are dissatisﬁed, the faculty is dis-
satisﬁed, the pigeons are dissatisﬁed, Dr. Nelson
is dissatisﬁed, the Bluejays are dissatisﬁed, the
Gremlins are dissatisﬁed, the Daffodils are dis-
satisﬁed -BUT the Devils continue on in their state
of blissful ignorance—the “peasants” are still dis-
satisﬁed.

However, everyone knows the situation~—There
is no need to explain. If a quote may be taken——
“Arguments pro and con have been tossed on the
rocks, picked tip, and tossed again——no need for
re-tossing them in your laps." Let us continue to
convince you of our status.

Change 18 necessary— yes, I guess changes
MUST be made sooner or later. BUT this old
world goes on and on—-Progress MUST take place
AND as we are held tip on a pedestal as THE
TEACHER COLLEGE of the state——and oh, yes,
OUTSTANDING FOR OUR PARTICIPATION
in student government, we must participate. But
this IS a serious situation and there musr be a
serious reason. You MUST realize the serious-
ness of this serious situation.

Are we participating? This morning you will
get your ballots in assembly. Do with them what
you may. (In case of doubt. save them for the
paper sale for the War Memorial) If by some slim
chance. you decide to vote look first to the right.
then to the left and blindly check one of the
blanks—~Speaking of blanks. you can leave it blank
if you'd likeminakes no difference. l‘ll.l".("l‘l()X
BY MINORITY is the rage that‘s sweeping the
campus.

But remember that your vote does not really
count. AINAKSYM (the present judiciary) casts
a discerning eye over the election results. decides
what they want. passes legislation (legislative and
judicial combined in one) among themselves and
makes the assembly "take cognizance of." So have
fun this morning. isn't it great that otir vote
can not bring World-shaking cveiitslll! l'se the
scraps for booknuirks, for your tasteless (.‘hiclets.
or for spitballs to throw at the campus “filliliust-
ers"z~AHave fun ~vote or not makes no differ—
enccﬂ-r-sudden inspiration l)on't vote.

STATE COLLEGE NEWS. FRIDAY, APRIL 1. 1949

 

 

 

 

"I have come back!" With this
dramatic and touching line the citr-
tain dropped on the last (it was a
struggle) scene of the one act
drama entitled “April’s Folly.” The
play, (and we use the Word loosely)
was well named; it was a piece of
sheer folly to attempt to present a
dramatic program whose main aim
was solely to amuse. Evidently the
director forgot that the audiences
at this college are hungry for plays
with social and economic Signiﬁ-
cance—Saroyan, Sartre, O’Neill—
plays of the “deep” type whose gen-
eral effect is to leave the audience
with food for thought. Did he, the
director. believe that the tumul-
tuous ovation which met the pro-
duction of Saroyan last semester
was not a sincere expression of ap-
preciation on the part of a very at-
tentive and serious audience? If
this is the truth. let us be the ﬁrst
to loudly exclaim, “CAD!”

We would also hasten to inform
those connected with our own "lit-
tle theatre“ experiment that this is
a college composed of mature peo-
ple who are not afraid to see is-
sues concerning man‘s injustice to
man. politics. and SEX isshhhh ! ii
paraded before them on our stage.
Here. we feel, is the real reason for
his dismal failure.

As for the "play" itself. the less
said about that the better. The
power of the dialogue was nil, and
with tongue in cheek. we take that
into consideration when we consid-
er the acting. This acting ,such as
it was. was reminiscent of the grade
school "pageants." We had our
doubts when Sadie Lopcnhelmer,
playing the role of the glamorous
Myrna. tripped over the train of
her gown in what was supposed to
be the seduction scene. But when
that hum of hams. Jim Doughnut.

And what about the technical

even if we couldn’t see the char-

was better that way; but outside of
that and a few other incidents like

discover who was old Mrs. Throck-

everything was a huge success.

To the Editor:

Are “Roberts Rules" necessary?

Ant-r sitting through recent as-
semblies. glued to my seat (the sun
shines directly on my back), this
question has been foremost in my
mind. Robert's Rules. as they are
used today. are only a hindrance
to more efficient functioning of the
Student Association meetings!

Let me give one specific example.
Last week a motion was introduced.
After the motion was react. several
points of order. procedure. and ex-
clamation were raised. Without
"Robert's Rules," the explanation
of these points would not have
been necessary. since there would
have been no book to refer to. and
without the book. how can you tell
one member of Student Association
from another?

Thus our first objective should
be, not to debate the new constitu-
tion, but to throw out the Rules of
Order. and have one big. happy.
and friendly discussion.

Sincerely Yours

 

 

Dear Editor:

Eloquence being in order for let-
ters to the Editor. I would like to
insert my wordy opinion. too. A
motion catiic up in Assembly not
too king ago for an ink-fountain

I object eloquently. wordily. and

fountain? NO! NO! NO! Vote NO!

cign group which receives CARE
