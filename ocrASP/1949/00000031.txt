Basketball season is over for one
more year, and with it went a very
successful season for the State
J.V.‘s. They had an 8-11 record for
the year, with much of the credit
101‘ their success going to their cap-
able coach, Walter Schick.

The high scorer for the year was
A1 Kaehn with a 139 for a 9.2 aver-
age. Next came Ted Bayer with 133
points for a 7.3 avorage. Third
was John Stevenson with 107 points
for a 5.9 average. Joe Colpoys with
68 and Bob Hausner with 63 fin-
ished out the Big Five. Joe Col-
poys with a .667 average and Ted
Bayer with a .566 average led the
foul shooting race.

Honorable mention should go to
Eiiglehart. Wetherby, Dolan, and
Matthews for their participation in

The Albany Business College

by taking two out Ur three games.
by bownng their nest totais of the

place. While the State kcglcrs were

thb’i iivc trounced Sicna twice in
tore-e tries [-0 boost their first place
huvillltilge to SIX games. Only two
weeks or play remain and the sit-
uation looks rather sad for the
home team. The 'ieachcrs can tie
the Engineers for top spot if they
wni their remaining SIX games, and
rtPI drops six.

By rolling 896 in the first contest,
the Statesmcn appeared to be well
on their way to Victory Wednesday
night. But, in the second tilt, the
big guns from ABC began to blast,
and irom that point on the Teachers
didn't have a chalice. Faced by
McGowan and Dominclli, the ABC
squad teamed up to roll it 912 in
the second game and finished with
892.

Individually thc boys from lower

for the cvcning's activity. Although

Manhattan, 64-5,-
Springmann Stars

State College completely outplay-
ed Manhattan College of New York
Saturday night in a game devoid of
thrills. The Purple and Gold dis-
played a brand of basketball which
not only baffled their opponents
but was a marvel to their support-
ers. Their passwork was excellent
as was their game throughout.

Springmann scored the first bus-
ket for State after about three
minutes of play. After this State
continued to score. the half ending
24—2. SDI’illgniallll and Cassavant di-
vided honors, each scoring four
field baskets. Masson contributed
two white Lobdcll and Polt each
scored a basket.

In the second half State did not
seem to be content with the lead
already held and scored points
at the rate of three a minute.
llpringmahn and Cassavant
were taking turns at dropping
the ball in the basket until Cassa-
vant was taken out to allow a sub—
stitutc an opportunity. Springniann
dropped in ten baskets and four
foul points during this half.

In answer to thousands of re-
quests (Ail anonymous but all sign-
ed with the initials “M.W.H."); in
response to the clamoring voices of
the students of NYSCT, the NEWS
has successfully engineered an‘ in-
terview with Dr. Clem Hathaway,
M.D., D.D., Ll.D. (Malrzy Doats,
Doazy Boats, and Little Lambsy
Diveyi. During the interview, the
NEWS learned the following:

“Prof. Hathaway," we continued,
“is it true that you Were ‘Little
All-America when you played foot-
ball at Cortland?"

“Ya-as." he replied. “I have the
certificate right here on my desk
somewhere."

He disappeared under the papers
piled on his desk.

"Dr. Hathaway.” we called tini-
idly. when, after a few minutes he
had not appeared. No answer. “Dr.
Hathaway . .  we queried again,
this time a little bolder. As there
was no reply, and he still had not
come out from under the papers on
his desk. we began to get worried.
Five minutes passed six—seven.

“HEY CLEM!" We roared, almost
giving up hope of ever seeing him
again. Unfortunately, he appeared
in a moment, and, regaining his
composure, mumbled,

“Have to clean up that desk
someday.” A

We continued the interview.
“Have you any hobbies, Dn?" we
asked.

“Oh, yes,“ he proudly replied. “I
have a wonderful hobby.” His chest
visibly swelled with .pride, as he
beamed all over at the Question.

“What is it. Prof. Hathaway. Tell
us.”

"Well,——I bead bags."

“YOU WHAT'H'H”

“I bead bags.”

"Bead Bags?”

“Bead Bags."

“Do you think there is any future
in beading bags, Dr. Hathaway?”

“Oh yes. Definitely. In fact, I am
pressing now to have it‘ inserted as
part of the physical training curri-
culum for freshmen.”

“What are your plans for the
future. Prof. Hathaway?”

“Well. I have in my possession
an oﬂer to replace Casey Stengel
as manager of the N. Y. Yankees
for the 1950 season. But I'm turning
it down. I love it here at dear old
State."
