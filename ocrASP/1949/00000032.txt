In State Colleges

According to Dr. Clarence V.
Scalding, Commissar of Education,
an increased enrollment for the
year 1949-50, will necessitate some
drastic changes in life at State Col-
leges throughout the State.

One of the most outstanding
changes recommended by the Bored
or Regents. is that of moving Crane
School of Music to Albany and in-
corporatlng it in part of the Assem-
bly chambers. Reasons for the move
include the need for the Governor
to take piano lessons before aspir-
ing to a higher position.

Living facilities for the estimated
additional 1,000 students are under
consideration, with the State Arm-
ory being considered for men stu~
dents and a new construction for
women. Lowest bids for this edifice
have come from the T. P. and Tom
E. Hawk Co. of Troy’s Technical
Training Tenements, Inc.

professor, Dean, Vice-President and
Acting-President of some of the
leading universities of the country,
Dr. Enrich is eminently suited for
the position of chief-executive of
the Board of Trustees of the State
University of New York."

In an interview with Dr. James
E. Allen. Executive Assistant to Dr.
Francis ’1‘. Spaulding, Commissioner
of Education, it was learned that
the Board will consist of fifteen
(Liovcrnor—appointees, who will have
jurisdiction over the 31 State
Schools. Including the II Teachers
Colleges.

Under the new State budget, 12
million dollars has been set aside
to build two new medical centers,
with complete medical-training
programs. One center is to be in
New York City. and the other, at
least 155 miles from the “center
of civilization.“ Tentative plans
call for Syracuse or Albany as the
probable site.

Comments from some of the
State's inl‘liunllal newspapers seem
to inrilcutc l1 negative atlltudv.‘ rc-
gill’t’llllg; the new sci-up. According
to an editorial from the January
13. Iii-ii) Issue of the Rochester
Demon-at and Chronicle. "It is a
backward rill). fifty years back-
ward . . . It would put all State-
supporch institutions of higher
lr-urniuu, including the teacher
truln'ng coll-lgcs. under political
control."

"for tho first time In memory,
this stall- is witl‘out the full unity.
integrity. and harmony in educa-
tiomll control that could hurt» bccn
Its pridc," slates the March 15.
1.049 editorial of the New York
