PAC! 2

..Cominent - - -

Anybody seems to have a chance in the elections
for the college year ’49-’50. Comment has been
heard that the slates of candidates are poor, that
the “right” people are not running, that the re-
sults will be unsatisfactory for the beneﬁt of Stu-
dent Association.

The number of people running for the major of-
ﬁces in Student Association is at an absolute min-
imum. Two people are running for the Presidency
and two for the Vice-Presidency of the Associa-
tion. Sufﬁcient numbers from the respective classes
are not on the list for the Student Board of Fi-
nance. The freshman class came through with six
candidates for the secretary of the Association.

With the ’50 class nominations, we find mini-
mum numbers running for six offices, one person
running for songleader and one for Publicity Di-
rector and no candidate listed for class treasurer.
Perhaps it would be a little trite to say that this
displays a lack of interest. If this is so, then what
is it?

Though the freshman class has the largest num-
ber of candidates listed for their offices, their list
is much shorter than that of a usual freshman
class. At the class meeting in which the nomina-
tions were made, there were many declinations
from the floor. Others followed by mail within a
few hours. Many members of the freshman class
have been dropping out of activities because of
their scholastic difficulties. Perhaps this is the
same reason for some of the disinterest of the
upperclassmen.

Then, too. there is the disgust. the “distaste”
referred to in this week‘s “Letter to the Editor."
This "distaste" has become so strong that certain
members of the Association. even prospective lead-
ers from the present Junior class. have decided to
let the reins go :tt‘d get out of Student Association
affairs. 'l‘his l.‘ certainly not a healthy situation.

No concrete solution tnay be offered. However,
it was the intention of this editorial to point otit
some of the recent election trends and to make
Student Assoi ia‘ on more completely aware of the
situation.

No further nominations may be made nor can
any more (lcclinations be accepted for class or Stu-
dent Association elections. Again to use an ex-
presion. "the die has been cast." Acceptance of
the present situation is absolutely necessary. The
first Friday after we return from the much-needed
vacation. elections will be held in assembly. [from
those people who are being considered for election.
it is your responsibility and duty' to try to select
those who you think will try to get government
functions on the plane that they should be.

Remember. that everyone had the chance to
nominate any individual that be felt was capable.
Selection must be made from those people on the
ballot. lie sure that you vote for people who you
think have the welfare of the Association at heart.
Try to keep otit the influence of "personaliiies.”

Student Association has a real problem. Next
year's governing officers will also have a real proli-
letn. It‘s up to each individual to do all he can
to vote for llic most capable people and then to
support them after their election on Moving-l'p
llav.

BEST NEWS

The sororities. which are supposed to be bogged
down in more tradition than the frats. have taken
the lead and have moved their bidding period inn,
the second semester.

Inter-Fraternity Council has been working on the
some plans and once the difficulties are straightened
out, they too will have second semester bidding.

HOT ROCK IDEA

How about opening the door leading outside from
the underpass betwoen lower Draper and the Coin—
mons. Putting this entrance into use would be es-
pecially helpful to those students who live Oil lilt‘
downtown side of the campus.

IIAWH

Bob Frasea. one of our delegates at the Eastern
States Association Conference two weeks ago. thought
that there was a little too much hot air floating
around the discussion panels too many lfll‘tii:»
and too few practical suggestions. He made illir.
opinion quite clear to a woman who was on one oi
the panels with him.

Bob later discovered that the woman was the \lllt'
of the president of the Easiein States Association

ANOTHER BIG QUESTION

With the budget being discussed there are iiio
questions. other than financial. that have lit-t-i:
brought. up.

1. How much influence should a faculty titi‘-l oi

the overall policy of the oi'gaiiizatioii'.‘

a year, the four "hams" may ap-

To the Editor: .

The decision of the students last
week in Assembly to reject the
proposed revision to the Constitu-
tion by no means places a touch
of finality on the subject. On the
contrary, the problems of improv-
ing our student government re-
mains of prime importance to the
students and impending elections.

First of all, a clear analysis
should be made of what the voting
results last week indicate. It is
safe to assume that the rejection of
the new constitution was not an
indication of the fact that the stu-
dents of SCT are satisfied with the
existing form of government, that
the students Were opposed to any
forin of change. that. the revised
form of the Constitution was sim-
ply “no good." What the voting
of the strident body did display was
disgust with the inconsequential.
tiresome. and insipid proceedings
of the last few assemblies; (lis-
taste for the method used where-
by the new constitution was im-
posed upon thcm with no other al-
ternative but to accept or reject
the document with a minimum of
time for consideration; discontent
with the present system. but a dis—
content that (lid not justify so rash
and drastic a revision without the
necessary advantgaes of time for
ample consideration.

What now remains for the stu-
dents of State College to do about.
their strident. government? Should
they accept; the present form with
all its apparent short comings. or
should they come to the realization
that the failings of their Constitu-
tion and Assembly should be recti-
fied, that the extensive and sincere
work of the Constitutional Coni-
mittee should be duly reconsidered.
that next. year should not. envisage
1 student. government personified
by inefficiency alid contradiction?
The latter alternative appears to
be the more desirable. and it. can
be attained. it call be attained at
this very time by choosing; such
students for political office who will
commit fhemselvcs to just such it
program next year.
