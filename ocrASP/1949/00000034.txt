Sophs Sweep Rivalry Basketball;
Men Easily Triumph In Two Games Gomm‘o Kap Takes Pin Crown

Basketball made its last gasp for

headlines last week as the two,

classes played their rivalry basket-
ball. games. The Sophs won both
the men‘s and the women’s divisions
as the hard fought contests drew
large and loudly-cheering crowds
from both the freshman and Soph-
omore classes. .

Soph Men Take Two

The men won two games in a
row to quickly garner the rivalry
points for the green. They had very
little trouble in either game. as
they Jumped to an early lead in
both games.

Bill Dunn sparked the ’51ers with
his deadly shooting in the first
game. He had 1'7 points. and was
followed by Paul Bullock and
George Dicks with 8 and 6. Ken
Rutley had 15 points for the fresh-
men. as the game ended at 37-30.

The second game followed the
pattern of the first, the Sophs win-

ning 53-35.. Paul Bullock, Bill
Dunn, and Ken Ludlum each had 12
points. Tom Yole had '7 to lead the
frosh.
Girls Play Three

’52 extended the Gremlins to 3
games before losing, 39-28; 43-45;
and 56-48. Betty Hicks led ’51 with
a 67 total. while Babe Paterson had
51 points. Jeanette Zelanis was out-
standing on offense. as her pass-
work, play-making, and all-around
ability led the Sophs to their wins.
Francis Skldmore, Joan Whitcraft,
and Phyllis Harris were outstand-
ing on defense. The freshman de-
fense also looked good against a
taller Soph team. Mary Borys, Helen
Pilcher. and Phoebe Fuller led the
defense work of the yellow-jackets.
Evelyn Kampke had 2'? points in
the 3 games, and her floor play led
the '52 team. Evelyn Erdle had 41
points and Joan Haggerty 45 to
lead the frosh offense.

The final phase of WAA Bowling
came to a close last week as Gam-
ma Kap became 1948-49 champs.
Taking second and third place hon-
ors were Pierce and Sayles respec-
tively. Mary Jane iFeris with a 138
average had the highest individual
average for the entire season.

After four months of bowling ap-
proximately 68 girls have earned a
minimum of 10 hours. The final
standings and individual averages
according to the number of games
each team has played are: Gamma
Kelp—624, Pierce—571. Sayles—
564. Chi Sig—541. Newman—526.2,
Fresh—521, Kappa Delta—529. Psi
Gamma—491. Phi Delta—514, Beta
Zeta—450. Wren—459, Alphi Epsilon
Phi—withdrew.

By defeating the Pierce A team
17-11, Beta Zeta became the 1948-49
basketball champs. Undefeated in
the play-offs. BZ finished strong

with victories over previously unde-
feated Sayles A. and Phi Delta.
Sayles Takes First Loss

The final standings were based
only on the results of the play-oil’s.
In the first games BZ defeated
Sayles A 14-9, and Pierce A beat
Phi Delta 13-8. This was Sayles'
first loss after an undefeated sea-
son.

On the second series of games
Fierce A and BZ remained in the
lead by taking Sayies and Phi Del-
ta. The scores were Pierce 13. Sayles
12; BZ 17, Phi Delta 8.

The deciding games saw Sayles
defeat Phi Delta 22~li and Fierce
bow to BZ, thereby deciding the
championship.

Defend Trophy

Potter Club did it again this year.
On March 31st, in Page Hall, before
a good-sized crowd left over from
the last of the Rivalry games, they
defended their championship by
defeating the “B” League Bulls in
one of their typical free-scoring
contests.

The Bulls held their own during
the opening minutes of the game
and held Potter to a. 16-11 caunt
as rho first quarter horn blew. The
EEP men (including a few suspend—
ers gradually pulled ahead and
“id at nun-time: 26-16. The third
period saw the loss of Klocpfel i‘or
Potter and Hoyt for the Bulls on
fouls. Schick and Kirby started hit-
ting freely and Mullin converted six
out of six foul shots to push the
team way out in front. At the
close of the third period it was
36-20 and the final: 62-27.

In a typical Potter specialty six
men united to sink 20 out of 25
free shots, while the Bulls. better
than the average oi Potter's com-
petition, couid put in only 5 of 18.

Article IX of the MAA Constitu-
tion states: Supreme veto over any
action of the Association has ‘vith
the Administration of New York
State College for Teachers. Few
other organizations have this right
in their constitution yet they func-
tion smoothly. Since MAA is sup-
ported by Student Association, it
should be student controlled. Yet.
a program such as MAA, faculty
supervision is desirable and neces—
sary for a good program. The abso-
lute veto power seems the rub.

Right- now spring sports are be—
ing carried on informally with no
faculty supervision. The schedules
have been set and only the con—
tracts hare to be signed to be coin-
pletcd.

The money has already been ap-
propriated and there are plenty of
men out for each team. A commit—
tee has been appointed to investi-
gate the constitution. During this
time. we'd like to ask Coach Hath-
away to continue until a compro-
misc can be reached.

Stat:- teams are improving evcl'y
year in crei‘y sport. It won't be
long before they will be back to
those of the 1936-42 era. Something
like this can act things back

RPl Captures First Place

Begins Practice

State College's baseball players
appeared for practice sessions for
the coming year about u week ago
and are looking forward to a suc-
cessful season. Added to last year’s
capable holdovers are many new-
comers who have looked exception-
ally good ln the first few practice
sessions.

Many Holdovers

Among the holdovcrs from last
year's squad will b: Harvey Clear-
water and Ben Saniorn on the
mound. Returning behind the plate
and with a good deal of experience
is John Stevenson. The infield will
have such veterans as Paul Cartcr.
Ray Munroe. and Ken Lcin on sec-
ond; John Duffus at. shortstop and
Willie Englehart at third. Al Kaehn
and Line Marzello are the only re—
turning veterans in the outfield.

Among the newcomers are pitch-
crs Gcorgc Lein, Bob Eich and Len-
ny AllllJW. who show considerable
promise in that department. At first
base four newcomers, Don McDon-
ald. Tom York, Ken Rutlcy. and
Harry Kane, are working hard to
tic down thi- podiion. Ray Sandor-
son is Duf‘l‘us's undcrsindy at short
while Jack Marks. :1 good pitcher in
his own right. is trying; his hand
at third. Don Sonbcrg and Jon Col-
poys. two i'rcslnncn, urc working
out in thc outi'icld. Colpoys shows
ccnsidcrublw promisc and should
dcrclop into :1 good bull player.

Munugcir. for this scuson will bc
Mikc Fisk and Don Burl. Assisting
Conch Hathaway in tho coachingl
roles will be Bob Dickinson and
Hank Furlz'y. two of last ycnr‘s rar-

The RPI bowling squad clinched
the 1948-49 championship in the
Intercollegiate League Wednesday
night by winning two games from
ABC. Before Wednesday's match.
the only hope the statesmen clung
to was a possible tie. and in oi'd.‘
to achieve this. RPI had to lose
their remaining six games while the
teachers won all six. The varsity
crew tried hard by winning three
games from Law. but the Engineers
refused to drop three games: thus
eliminating all ﬁrst place coiitend-
crs. It was a bad break for the
statesmen. because they led the
league most of the season. in rc-
cent weeks, an unconqucrablc
slump cost the kcglers first place.

In Wednesday's match. the Law
School quintet were at their all-
timc low. thus State had an easy
time of taking the three-game sci.
Thc Siatcsmen rollcd 866 in the
opener and clinchcd ihc contest by
