Dr. Krumlo Relates Impressions
OI German Professor ln U. 5.

By BRENNER & FENZEL

Sprechen Si-e Deutsch? That was
the pertinent question at Pierce
Hall during last week. Dr. Hein-
rich Krumb, Professor at the Ped-
agoglc Institute at Darmstadt, Ger-
many, was occupying the guest room
at Pierce while observing classes
and teaching methods of the Speech
department at State College.

Dr. Krtunb is one of twenty pro-
fessors from Germany visiting Am-
erican colleges and universities to
study methods of improving curri-
culum in German universities. He
will have visited schools of all sizes
when he completes his three month
tour here. On his itinerary, besides
State College, are Geneseo State
Teachers' College, Northwestern
University, Columbia University and
several others.

After returning to Germany, he
will try to incorporate the best
points. that he finds prevailing in
these schools. in his program of re-
lating hearing and speech correc-
tion in German teachers‘ colleges.

Comparing German and American
teachers‘ colleges is difficult accord-
ing to Dr. Krumb. To becomeahigh
school teacher in Germany a stu—

dent is obliged to attend the uni-
versity for three years and the Ped-
agogic Institute for one year. To
attend the university one has to
have had completed studies com-
parable to those of American junior
colleges.

Entertained at dinner by several
State College German students, Dr.
Krtnnb left Albany saying: “I am
delighted at the behavior of the
students and We have spent many
nice hours tog-ether.”

By EVELYN WOLFE

One of the lnost recent contro-
versial bills to come up in the New
York State Senate was introduced
by majority leader. Benjamin Fein-
bcrg of Plattsburg. The substance
of the bill. which Governor Dewey
passed without. comment, boils
down to a few simple facts, which
have been said to have been
brought about by a tendency to—
ward rcd hysteria. which seems to
bc sweeping the country.

Says Time Magazine in its April
11 issue: "Under the Feinberg bill,
the Board of Regents. the top gov-
r-rning body of the State public-
school syslcm. will be the sole au—
thority for wccding out ‘subvcrsive‘
tcncltcrs. The bill requires the Re-
gcllts to draw up a list of all sub-
Vcl'sivc organizations and makes
membership in such organizations
sufﬁcient grounds for summary re-
moval. The Regents are also em—
powered to dismiss school employ-
ccs for the “utterance of any trea-
sonablc or seditious word or the
doing of any treasonablc or sedi-
tious act, regardless of their affilia—
tions."'

Dcspitc Vigorous protests of var—
ious tcachcr‘s organizations, this
law is now part of the State Sta-
tutes. No comment has come from
the National Education Association,
citllcr through verbal addresses or
written reports in the weekly rc—
vicw published by that organiza—
tion, save a brief commentary stat-
ing that such a law had been
passed.

Senator Fcinbcrg has been on tho
cducaliomrl committee until rc-
ccntly. Ho has sponsored such oth—
(’1' educational measures, as the
proposed control of publication and
sale of comic books. He considers
lllc prcscnt law restricting club

ﬁnest bill be has sponsored during
his long (16 years) career in the
legislature.”

According to the New York Daily
News for October 23, 1948, the
American Legion favored such a
piece of legislation, which at that
time was still in the proposal stage.
This organization strikes most
heavily against the “fellow travel-
er" rather than the outright party
mcmbcl‘.

Therefore, any person who is a
member of one of the organizations
Iistcd as subversive, may be classed
as a "fellow traveler," regardless of
his party afﬁliation.

The American Labor party has
promised to take the bill to court
in a lost cnsv trial, and to supply
counsel for the first person indicted
under its clauses.

Rcccnt hearings conducted by
the House of Representative Un-
Amcl'i ~an Activities Committee
have also tended toward Congres-
sionnl apprmal of the policy em—
bodi-cd in the New York State Bill.
