ANeed...

With spring in Europe has come a need for seeds.
and a draining of the warehouses before the crops
can be gathered. The same sunny weather which
has made many State students dreamy and rcst-
less as they look out the window brings no ccssa~
tion of hunger or any promise, as yet, to the people
in war—changed countries.

Appropriately enough, we are trying to help
them to repair a little of the war‘s damagcs.
through ottr War Memorial. liven thottgh this
memorial departs from the traditional memorial.
few things could be more appropriate.

552500 is a reasonable goal to set for a War Mc—
tnorial in a college of the size of State College.
$1.52 may seem like tnorc money than we havc
at the moment, bttt saved over three weeks. it
becomes a reasonable goal. 'l‘hc campaign for
money has differed from other financial campaigns.
More than being not compulsory, this drive has
depended upon publicity, and thc dcsirc of thc
students to create a successful War Memorial.
Although $513.32 from Student Council. through
the Big-4 fund, started the drive. undcr $200 has
been donated by the students. In othcr Words, only
about one third of the goal has bccn met.

The memorial was votcd by the assembly. Al—
though the vote was not unanimous. thc opposi-
tion was small. Most people personally fccl that
(.‘ARlC's work is worthy and worth thcir attcution.
l-lowcvcr, some have wondered just how it func-
tions in the scnsc of a War Mcmorial. mainly bc-
causc thcrc sccmcd to bc little pcrmancucy about
it. The (‘Athl organization has statcd that it
will scnd to Staic (,‘ollcgc lcttcrs of recognition

STATE COLLEGE NIWI. FRIDAY. APRIL as. 1946

 

4W? .7

By ROBERT FRENCH

I dropped in to see old Pharaoh
the other day, and surprisingly
enough the old fellow was hale and
hearty with an optimistic attitude
toward the future. We reminisced
a bit about old Egypt, "the good
old days" when community spirit
and cooperation were at a zenith.
Pharaoh said he had everyone
pretty Well convinced then that
planning was the secret of success.

“Geography helped a bit." he
said, “since it was obviously im-
possible to divide the Nile into pri-
vate holdings and as the land was
worthless without the water, most
folks went along with state owner-
ship and control. It took quite a
bureaucracy to keep things running
smoothly and of course they had
to be compensated with a higher
standard of living. All the rest of
the people were equal. The state
cared for them from the proceeds
of their labor and guaranteed to
all a minimum subsistence.

“We had one planner who was
a crackerjack. Name was Joseph.
if I remember rightly, and he saved
the bacon during the seven years
famine. For the seven years before
that he'd been piling tip grain in
storehouscs. I thought he’d get
lynched because people sure hated
to see that good food being stored
when they could eat it. But of
course you can't pay any attention
to their wishes when you're plan-
ning the greatest good for the
greatest number. It isn‘t so bad
now—a-days with newspapers. ra-
dios and son forth to twist them
around to your way. but Joe had a
tough time. I'll tell you.

“I never did figure out one thing
that happened after that. Joe's
people run out on Inc. They actual-
ly decided they'd rather live in the
wilderness than stay in Egypt. Of
course I had to chase them because
you just can‘t allow people to get
wild ideas in a planned economyri
throws the plans all off. I never
did catch them. had to swim back.
Much as I hate to admit it. there's
no accounting for folks“ taste.

“Things went along fair 1'y
smoothly after that for a while. I
didn‘t plan it that way. but maybe
it. was just as well they (lid lcavc.
Most of the other kings around run
their countries my way. When the
Romans took over. business got
rather bad for about seventeen
hundred years, but nobody really
challenged my methods until about
two lutndrcd years ago. Then they
split the property tip until each lit-
tle fellow owned a piece all by him-
self. I still shudder to think of it.

"Sonic Nobocy would gct an idca

house of cards. Confounded anar-
chyi I never would allow such go-
ings-on in a planned economy of
mine. Then this cockeyed Tom Jef-
ferson decided to let people vote on
things. Any damn fool knows the
people always vote for an appro-
priation and against a tax. Of
course people in the newer coun-
tries made a better living than we
did but it just made them more
restless and selfish.

“They're calming down now.
Anyone knows that the old ideas
are best. All We have to do is con-
vince folks to work for the good of
the whole state rather than for
private gain and things will settle
down again. They're doing it in
Russia now. 0ch Joe Stalin is some
shirt-tail relation of mine. He has
to be a bit tough with them but
after all. ‘thc greatest good for be
greatest number' demands some
sacrifices. Even old England (where
that old reprobatc John Locke liv—
ed, who talked so much about pri-
vate propertyi is coming around. I
understand they‘re trying to do it,
the easy way. but I‘ve been in the
business for nearly six thousand
years and I'm not so sure; I‘ll stick
to the tried and tested methods.

"But as I said. ‘things are look-
ing up.‘ I'm moving to America
soon. They‘rc about ready for a
planned economy. most, of the
spade work's done. I think I‘ll make
a great success of it bttt I wish I
had old Joseph back. Best planner
I ever had. I asked him once how
he knew what was coming and he
said something about (livinc guid-
ance from a i'cllow named Jehovah.
That's what you need for a real
planned economy—divine guidance.
11' yott see somebody that has it.
send him around. I'll give him a
good job in America. it‘s the biggcst
oiic so far.

The Common-Slater is given the widest latitude as
author of this column, although his viewpoints do
not necessarily reflect those of the STAT COLLEGE
News.

THE BIG PUSH . . .

. . . Towards the ﬁnals has begun. Those of us who
spent the vacation completing reports and term pa-
pers. studying, and doing some extra reading for our
cultural improvement will have an easy time of it,
but you people who caught up on your sleep and
spent the time carousing. will be sorry.

The Easter Bunny may have brought eggs to some
but it brought letters from the registrar's ofﬁce to
those who laid more than one egg on the mld-seins.

I heard of one letter that was sent to the home
of a vet who had received two warnings. His wife
gave him hell and he had to sleep in the bathtub
for a week.

THAT FURNITURE . . .

. in the hall between lower Draper and Hustcd
is surplus stqu from Mohawk College. No wonder
they had to close the place.

’i‘llE FRA’I‘S . . .

. made the big change in bidding that most of
their members were bucking for. Like the sororities,
bids to freshmen won't go in until second semester.

ANTHONY PROCHILO

Basically. my platform is that I
shall endeavor to develop a situa-
tion and attitude in Student As—
sociation that will be conducive to
a desire on the part of all mem-
bers to participate and to work for
the beneﬁt of the whole group.
Looking in this direction, I would
advocate:

i. That the student assembly re-
main as our legislative body; 2. A
clai‘ii‘t‘ation ot' the duties of Mys-
kania and Student Council, that
they may more efﬁciently operate;
3. A more flexible use of Roberts‘
Rules of Order. at the discretion of
the group; 4. Plugging up of the
holes in the constitution. and rising
it rathcr than abusing it; 5. Better
separation of busincss and enter-
tuinment. Incctings to avoid the
confusion of issues we have had to
bcar this past year: 6. Thorough
consideration of the pending bud-
gct: especially to resolve the ques-
tion 01' key presentations; 7. Inves-
tigation of the cafeteria situation.
pointing toward improvement of
food, prices and service; 8. The pos-
sibility of making our student tax
tickets good for a diseottnt on pur-
chases mud-c in Albany.

1. Our social calendar doesn't
meet the needs of the students.
This is evidenced by the number
who participate. benefit. or even
witness the events. The schedule
could contain a wider range of ac—
tivities and interests so that more
people will profit, from our social
schedule.

2. Business meetings of the As-
sembly should be conducted using
parliamentary procedure so that
we can have the most deliberation
in the smallest amount of time.
Ten business meetings a year could
dispense with all business. leaving
the remaining periods for presenta—
tions that are beneﬁcial and enter-
taining.

3. The constitution extends the
privilege of Myskania membership
to the President. I do not believe
he should accept this membership
since it, is the judicial body.

4. The constitution needs to bc
amended with two main considera-
tion. A. Myskania is not the prop-
er group to designate as a judic-
