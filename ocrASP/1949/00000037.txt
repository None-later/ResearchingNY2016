Next week, on May 3, the golf

Country Club against ABC. The
team will have Bill Bowen as its
coach, a grad from last year’s team.
He has informed us that four of
last year’s team are back with him.
The nucleus of his team will be
built around these men. Back from
last year are Al Beninati, Joe Bi-
viano, Joe Carosella, and Walt Wad-
ach. Several other men are out for
the team and show promise of aid-
ing the squad. Harry Kane shows
the greatest promise with several
70 games in practice. Others out
are: Ted Bayer, George Christie,
Marv Lansky, Ken O’Hara. George
Poulos, Ben Warrell, and Jack
Whalen. Bowen expects there will

be a six-man playing team.

team two years ago. will be trying

Frosli Girls Defeat Sophomores

The Sophomore girls bowed to
the freshmen for their first athletic
rivalry loss of the year. At 7:30
Wednesday night the two teams met
in Page Hall with the loyal support
of many of their classmates. The
rooters cheered both teams on by
singing and clapping.

Overtime Necessary

A tie was the result of the first
game, but in the overtime the frosh
pushed ahead and won the contest.
The score was 23-23 when the game
was over. Referees Lucy Lytle and
Betty Winkler called a six minute
overtime period to be played in two
three-minute periods. The frosh
were off to an immediate lead and
held it throughout the time with
the result that they won by a 32-29
count.

(In Rivalry Volleyball Coniesis

The second game showed the sur-
passing team work of the frosh.
Getting off to an early lead they
held it to the end. The Sophomores
were inspired with enthusiasm in
the second quarter of the game but
proved an unequal rival for their
opponents. When the time was up
the fresh had captured their sec—
ond victory and two rivalry points.
Superior Frosh Team Work

Throughout both gan as the frosh
played well together. The Sopho-
mores had several individual stars
but they failed to function as a
team. Betty Hicks was of great
value at the net and Ann Braash
did a good job of returning hard
smashes from the rear of the court.
Several others were also outstand-
ing in their serving and recovering.

‘PAOI I ..

 

 

[coking ﬂack

By HARVEY MILK

IM sports are coming to a close
for this year. There were many
"beefs" and many constructive cri-
ticisms about the IM program. I
would like to bring together some
of these opinions.

Rivalry

(1) The confiislon betwaen WAA.
MAA, and the Rivalry Committee
in ‘scheduling events. There has
been a lot of talk about doing
something for next year. How about
some action now-before it is too
late. Add one member from MAA
and WAA to the committee and
schedule all events at the start of
the year; there won't be any trou—
ble about dates and there won't be
any trouble like there was this year
in regard to volleyball.

Football

(2) The football season lasted
too long in the sense that too many
games were played half in the
darkness 0f the early winter nights.
It was suggested that the games
also be played on Saturdays. It
could be worked out.

Volleyball

(3) The volleyball league was to
be played in two parts: one between
the football and basketball seasons
and thc othcr between the bask-ct-
bnll and baseball seasons. Due to
lack of correct planning there was
not enough time for the second
round. Why not set up the com-
plctc IM schedule at the start of
the year so there will not be ally
qucstions in anyonc's mind as to
what sports are to be played and
when thcy are to be played?
Basketball

(4) The basketball season lasted
too long. Saturday games had to
be played. Should they be incorpor-
ated again next year? The opinion
seems to be yes. Have them
throughout the complete season.
but first ﬁnd out what teams can
play on Saturdays so there aren't
any forfeits.

Freshmen Orientation

if): Talk was started about ori-
cntating the freshmen on the IM
football rules and how “it is played
at State." It is a good idea. Send
any suggestions to A] Holliday,
next year‘s football manager.
Ofﬁcials

(6) The biggest "problem" was
the refs and the scorers. There were
no set regulations for the scoring
except bowling. Score books were
lost and there was just one heck-
of—a-mcss. Why not set up some
sort of rewards for scorekcepers
and set up :1 workable system? As
for the refs the less said should be
the best. but it is ii big problem
and should be attended to right
away. Even in the softball season
refs are assigned to cover a game
and never show up. Why not set
up some sort of a penalty if as-
signed refs don‘t show up?
Softball

I7) Thc softball season is off to :1
good start. Lenny Skolnick should
be congratulated for the ﬁne job
he is doing. Everyone is waiting for
the evening games.
Suggestions

(81 Al'tcr thc football
suggested something to bc done
about forfeits Nothing was donc.
Forfeits continued. Nothing has
bccn doiic. Why not? Do you want
more forfeits?

KB Downs Potter Opens Season Suller Defeats

Ccrosclla Holds KD R
In Wednesday's Game

The Suspenders increased their
lead on first. place Wednesday aft-
ernoon by dropping KDR. 10-3. Joe
Carosella toed the rubber for the
winners and had KDR in his hand
throughout most of the game.

Capitalizing- on Clark's wildness,
several errors, and speedy base run-
ning, the Suspenders walked away
With the game. In the third Ulﬂi‘K
was hit hard for five hits and six
runs that were aided by three KDR
eirors. This was more than enough
to win as Carosella was very stingy
in giving up base hits. Joe was also
in fine control as he issued only
one free. pass. coming in the fourth.
Zanchelli and McGrath both pound-
ed Clark for doubles and singles
while Owens laid down two perfect
bunts and added a single to give
him three for three. Clark was the
only one who could get anywhere
with Carosclla as be doubled and
singled.

The fine fielding of the Suspen-
dcrs aided Cill'OSCllﬂ in gaining his
second win. Schick covered center
ficld as if he owned it.

KB Downs Potter

On Tuesday KB downed Tottcr in
a slug—fest. 13-12. The fine rclief
pitching of Ganeles held Potter at
bay ilitL‘l' they had iced-oil on
I.iskcr for 10 runs in the first two
innings. Mixing, five hits. two walks.
and one error for eight runs in the
second. Potter seemed to be well on
their way to their second win. How-
ever Guhclcs held them down while
he helped his teammates slowly cut
down the lend until they scored the
winning rim in the last of the sev-
enth ns Gahelcs drove in WiiXlllﬂll
with a long fly to right.

Lisker Homers

A borne run by Lisker. three sin-
gles by Berger, two doubles by Gali-
cles. and three llli.\ hr i'a ll wci'c
pounded off of Powell. along with
eight walks and an error. Warden
and Lansky each hit for the circuit
for the losers.

Also on Tuesday the Angels. be-
hind the pitching of Glcndny and
Brown.took the NKVD's pitching of
Brayden and belted out eight runs
to win 8-1. The Beavers also won
on Monday by hitting for 18 runs
in a game marked by many crrors.
The Miter-Mites. the victims. bc-
hind Noble‘s tossing. scorczl eight
runs off anpmnn. Fisk drove in
four runs and Mathews hit 11 hom-
or for the winners.

This article has to be in before
the opening game of State's 1949
baseball schedule gets under way.
In case some of you were not
sine to attend the game Thursday.
here is a short preview of the team
and what is in store for it.

Things look better this year for
the statesmen since they seem to
have a better fielding and hitting
team. The outstanding part of prac-
tice sessions has been the work of
the pitchers. They have been some-
thing short of terrific. The mounds-
men this year will be Bob Eich. Len
Amlnw. and Harvey Clearwater.
This trio will be backed by Ben
Santora and George Lein.

The sore spot of the team again
this year is catching. Although
John Stevenson has improved great-
ly over last year, he still has a long
way to come. Another weakness in
the department is that Stevie is
the only catcher on the roster.
Infield Stronger

The infield promises to be much
better than last year's if Jack Marks
can come through at the first base
post. Paul Carter. John Duﬂ'us and
Bill Englchart round out the in—
field. Although Englehart seems to
have his job sewed up. “Red” San-

State’s Varsity bowling team
wound up the 1948-49 season in the
Intercollegiate league with a dismal
three-game setback at the hands of
Pharmacy. This defeat may prove
very costly to the statesmen who
are. at this writing. clinging to sec-
ond place by the very slim margin
of one game.

The final standings have not
been released as yet. due to the fact
that a postponed match between
Pharmacy and ABC has not been
rolled off. The outcome of this
match will determine whether the
statesmen will finish the season in
second or third place. If the Phar-
macy quintet takes two games or
more. they will take over undisputed
possession of second place, dropping
the State keglers to third. On the
other hand. if the druggists win one
game. the two teams will wind up
the campaiin tied for the runner-
up spot. ABC could make it pos-
sible for State to cop second place
by taking the entire set. Here are
the present standings:

In State's final match of the sea-
son. rolled at the Playdium on the
Sunday afternoon prior to vacation.
the Varsity keglers put on one of
their poorest showings of the year.
Bob Dickinson was the only incin-
ber of the squad who was able to
crash the 500 mark. He put togeth-
cr games of 164. 197. and 210 for a
heat total of 571. His 210 single
game was also high for both teams
in that department. For the oppo—
sition. four 500 totals were record-
ed includihg Abbott‘s 564.

As a reminder, the quintet from

RPI captured the first place honors
in the league this season. The
statesmen held down first place the
major part of the season, but, in
recent weeks, they encountered a
slump which they could not shake.
The engineers took advantage of
every break and sewed up the pen-
nant two weeks before the season
ended.

The match between Hartwlck
College and the Varsity crew sched-
uled for April 10th was cancelled
due to the failure of the Hartwick
lads to put in an appearance.

Sticking our necks out after the
baseball season has been officially
opened with a week of play already
under the wire. we will list our
views on the outcome of the cur—
rent major league campaign. Al-
though somc of the more rabid
Yankee and Red Sox fans may not
agree. we pick the Cleveland In-
dians and Bob Feller and his ach—
ing arm to repeat. The Yankees.
cpening the season with a string of
yi"t0ries against; Washington and
Boston. may encounter more diffi-
culty in the west. so we are giv-
ing them the number two spot.

In the National league. we predict
another sizzling race, the particip-
ants being Boston, Brooklyn. St.
Louis. and Pittsburgh. We are also
giving the Giants and the Phillies
an outside chance to crash the first
division if their pitching improves.
