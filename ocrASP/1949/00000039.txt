You Are A Citizen - - -

Comments concerning the slates of ofﬁcers and
the probable results of the spring elections will be
veriﬁed or disqualiﬁed tomorrow with the Movtng-
Up Day announcements. Regardless of what the
results are, there still may be some dissatisfaction
by certain groups iii the Association. Discord
rather than harmony has seemed to be the key-
note in Student Association affairs this past year.
Perhaps it was the ofﬁcers in power and perhaps
the rest of SA just didn't give their elected ofﬁcers
a chance. Someone made the suggestion that a
recording be made with all the ceremony of Mov-
ing-Up Day and all the announcements along With
the resultant cheerings and shouts of joy in order
that these recordings might be referred to next
December when the SA members are bewaiiing
their fate for having elected such and such a per—
son or such and such a group. Difﬁculties arise
many times because of ridiculous reasons. Very
often misunderstanding concerning deﬁnitions of
words or duties causes a huge mess over something
perfectly logical. Everyone that is elected toany
ofﬁce has a job to do and it is tip to each indiVid—
ual to accept that responsibility. If a person is
not willing to do this, he should not run for ofﬁce.
in the long run perhaps it is a good thing that so
many declined from offices this year. Perhaps
these individuals know themselves better than
some SA members have in the past.

We have people elected to publish a college
yearbook, individuals elected to work on the Stu—
ileiit Board of Finance and to handle the moneys
that the students are paying in their student tax.
atid students elected to produce plays of college
caliber. All these offices require diligence and a
sense of responsibility.

()ur choices have been tnade. Nothing we can
do will change these tiow. It is up to us as mature
college citizens to respect those tiewly~elected of-
ficers and to cooperate with them in the projects
they will undertake. if someone is in the wrong.
then tell hint-«but openly and tactf'ullwaor the
benefit of the entire Association.

Good Luck - - -

Another year has rolled by and new staff mem-
bers will take over the publication of the NEWS
for next week. This year has meant many diffi-
culties for the college paper, some resulting from
a few drastic stands on major issues which were
resented by some and respected by others. These
stands Were all a necessary part of a functioning
newspaper and will contitute to be a part of this
newspaper if it is to function as it should. The
same complaints have been heard concerning lcav~
ittg otit stories and not giving sufficient space to
certain organizations. It can honestly be said.
however. by anyone who has been familiar with
the workings of the staff. that they have tried their
best to present to the students ati hottest and fair
picture of the college activities.

The Work of the staff this year has been tniicli
appreciated. Next year's staff has ltad a great
deal of experience and will continue to carry out
the principles of journalism set up as representa-
tive of college newspaper caliber. Good luck.

WAR MEMORIAL?

What a splendid showing we have made with our
CARE contributionil More than one—half of the
total sum that we are contributing to CARE comes
from the Big Four Fund. The disposal of this Fund
was up to Student Council and the members of the
student body never felt it or had to sacriﬁce for it.
There were only 10 of the 23 representatives at the
Student Council meeting that decided to give $513
of that fund to the War Memorial Committee.

‘r_—-.

 

At any rate. all those who voted for a War Mo-
mortal. and all those who voted for CARE as a

memorial, didn‘t knock themselves out with sacriﬁces.

NEW GYM LIGHTS

We may have a lot of demands for improvement
in our college facilities but the state catne througn
this titne with new lights for the Page Hall gym.
The new lamps give ﬁve times as tnuch candlepowcr
as the old ones did.

Which proves that the administration doesn't frown

on everything that is “lit up."‘

Last Sunday there was a great conflagrafion ill

the Van Derzee kitchen. The steaks . . . which lllt'

For one year twelve people worked
at it! Result—nil! “Ah well. one

Remember? Myskania will never
forget its “musical aptitude." In
fact they had even planned a mu-
sical show for State College which
circumstances prevented them from
presenting. (They grudgingly adtnit
it's probably fortunate for the stu-

they. "Ask him to sing for you

dare?

but. he had no typewriter . . . . SO!
Bob also recalls the day when. dtie

Remember Joseph Zuttohelli? Mys-
kania can‘t rettiember hitii without.
remembering "referee" and “in-
nings.‘ He used to do his best to
squeeze in betwvcn innings etc.

Remember Jim Bropliy? How
could Myskania forget its biggest.
tease? Never could Jean or Kocky
speak about-you guessed it with-
out Brophy giving them the razz.

Remember Perry Piers and June?
“Sure do!" says Myskania. “They
came in late, but by gosh. they
caught on fast and certainly did a
fine job."

Yes. REMEMBER! They'll never
forget.
