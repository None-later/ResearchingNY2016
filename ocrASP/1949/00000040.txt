MOVING-UP DAY SONGS PTA Sponsors 

To the Editor:

Table tennis is a favorite sport
at our college. Recently Ted
Strauss, class of ’51. won an up-
state New York Tablc Tennis
championship held at Canojohaire,
New York. He now qualifies for
the national finals to be held in
Chicago on May 7. The total or.-
peiise would entail $75.

Ted recently won the table ion-
iiis here which was sponsored by
MAA. I firmly believe that. it
would be beneficial to our coll-"go
if we sent him as a representative
of SCT to the national finals.

Ted has explained that ho Will
put Lip one-third of the expense ii‘
the college will furnish the remain-
der. If he were fortunate enough
to win any cash prizes. hc explain—
cd that he would pay us back.

Various ai'guiiients were raised
against my proposal. I will attempt.
to answer these arguments now.

The question was raised of what
use it would be to sponsor Tcd to

Set Back In Opener 6_2 Take Frosh: 8-3

Eich, Amlaw
Star On Mound

Varsity Faces Adams
Pharmacy Next Week

The Varsity baseball squad has
opened the 1949 season with a
bang. taking two out of the three
games they have already played.
Although they suffered a 6-2 set-
back in the opening game at
Bleecker Stadium last Thursday.
they have since chalked up two
wins at the expense of Utica Col—
lege and ABC.

Poor Start

The Statesinen got off to a wob-
bly start in the inaugural against
North Adams by sporting the Mas-
sachusetts teachers a 4—0 lead in
the ﬁrst three innings. With liar-
vey Cleai'water on the mound for
State. Harrington. the lead-off man
for North Adams, opened the game
With a sharp single to center. Min—
ardi then waited out a walk to ad-
vance Harrington to second. who
later took third on a wild pitch.
J. Naglc skied to Mai'zcllo in left
with Harrington scoring after the
catch. With a runner on ﬁrst and
one out. R. Naglc sent a single
to left center. but Bill Englchnrt.
State third sackcr. turned Ticplc's
line drive into an unassisted double
play to put out the ﬁre. The opposi~
tion took advantage of a coupl cfo
inﬁeld terms to score a run in the
second stanza. In the third inning.
Amlaw was called on to take over
the pitching chores for the States-
mcn after .1. Nagle opened the
frame with a double. Before he re—
tired the side. two singles and a
hit-batsman provided two more tal-
lies for North Adams.

State Scores

In the meantime. the statesmen
couldn't do a thing against the
right-handed slants of J. Naglc.
pitcher for North Adams. Hc passcd
out three bases on balls in the sec-
ond inning. out no runs crossed the
plate. In the third inning. Amlaw
worked N'iglc for a free pass. thcn
Paul Carter broke the ice by driv-
ing a liner into ccntcrﬁcld for one
base. The center ﬁelder let the ball
go through for a tivo biisc crror
permitting Anilaw to score. and
sending Carter to third. Cartcr
scored a moment later on Englc'-
hart‘s bouncer to second.

Amlaw piiched very good ball un—
til he ran into lroublc in the scy-
cnth. The result was two runs for
North Adams. This closcd ihc scor-
ing for the ni'ici'noon as the States—
mcn were only able to garner onc
more liil. Cartcr‘s sccoiid single.

Saturday aftcrnoon at Uiici, Bob
Eich. newcomer to the squad. pitcli-

 

 

ed and batted the Varsity squad
to their ﬁrst victory of the cam-
paign. 6-4. After the third inning,
Eicli was in complete command as
he allowed no runs and only two
hits the rest of the way. His bat
was also very important in the vic-
tory. Coming to the plate in the
ninth inning with the bases loaded.
nobody out. and the statesmen
trailing by a score of 4-2. Eich
drove a drch into deep right ﬁeld
that went for three bases and
cleaned the sacks. Bob later scored
on Carter's inﬁeld out. to account
for the fourth run of the inning.
Although Utica threatened in their
half of the ninth. Eicb tightened
up and got shortstop Jeff to sky
out to centci'ﬁeld for ihc ﬁnal out
of the game.

On Wednesday afternoon at
Blecckei' Stadium. the Varsity once
again provided the spectators with
a thriller by scoring a run in the
last half of the ninth to break a
4-4 tie. and win the game. 5-4.
Coach Hathaway started Lennie
Amlaw on ihc mound. and Aiiilaw
found himself in hot waicr in the
ﬁrst inning. giving up two runs on
two hits and a frcc pass. The squad
picked up .i run in ibcir half on
singlcs by Bill Eiigichari and A1
Knchn. coupled with a base on
balls to Bob Eich. ABC picked up
another run in ihc second. and thc
honic tcaiii cziinc back in the fourth
to tie ihc scoi'c at. 3-11“. Joc Col-
poys singlcd. stoic second. advanced
to ihii'd on the coiclici"s error. and

son's boimdcr to shori. and rode
home on Aininw's sharp single to
center.

ABC scored run nuiiibcr four in
the sixth and Staic promptly ticd
ihc game with a run in ilicir half.
Things wont smoothly until the last
half of the ninth. Then the States-
men pushed across lhc winning run
as A1 Kaolin camc ihi'ough with
the tale-telling blow. Bob Eich. who
has proven himself a very valuable
member of ihc squad. had singlcd
and stole sccolid to sct ihc sccnc for
Kachn‘s single.

Bee’s Errors Lose
Close Pitching Game

“Play ball." was the cry from the
umpire and the pitcher went into
his wiiidup. "It was one! tw0!
threei strikes, you're out, at the old
ball game.” And so it was in the
men's rivalry game on Page Field
last Tuesday. The strikes were fur-
nlslied by Dave Clark and the outs
were furnished by the poor fresh-
men.

Showing excellent mastery of a
fast ball Clark struck out a total
of nine Frosli. Among his victims
were Lavey. Joy. Hausner, Bennett,
Yole. Stevenson. Brown and Son-
berg twice. Although the frosli co]-
Iectcd three rims off his pitching
none of them were earned due to
several mispla'ys.

Opening up the third with a
strikeout the frosli's pitcher Brown
seemed oi. be on his way out of
another liming without any troub-
lo. After Lampnian grounded out
to third. it seemed as though it
was going to develop into a pitch-
er‘s duel. Then it happened, Mor-
iariiy laid down a bunt and ad-
vanced to second when Wiley
through wide in a vain attempt to
firsi. Warden up next drew a pass
and both were driven in on Ganels'
double. Wctherby singled Gaiieles
home and on the first pitch to
Mathews he stole second. Bennett's
attempt to gel Wciherby was high
and rolled dccp into center enab-
ling Wetherby io come home with
the fourth run of ihe inning.

The frosli came back with two
in the fourth as Hausner and
Wilcy opened ihc inning with walks
and scored on an ci'l'OI' on Joy‘s
grounder and a sacrifice hit by
Owens. Thcy picked up one more
in ihc sixih on a single by Son—
bcrg and an error on Hausner‘s
single to right center. The Sophs
came back in the last inning with
a four run outburst. that was
marked as a comedy of errors. Five
frosh errors and one hit by Lamp-
mon gave ihc Gremlins more than
cnough insurance as Dunn. Bro-
phy. Clark. and Lampmaii all
('l‘OHSL‘d the plate.

Bob Brown who tocci the mound
for the Bccr; only allowed ﬁve hits
and iyvo earned runs during the
game. but ihc sloppy playing of the
frosli infield was their downfail.
Thc only member of the infield
who didn‘t booi a ball was Owens
who liaiidlcd ninc chances flawless-
ly.

State Outscores
ABC In Goll Tilt,

Biviano Shines

state's golf team came through
on their first match of the year to
win luvs-Va. All the members of the
team won 3 points except Al Benin-
ati who received 2% points.

Those who played for State and
the order they played are Harry
Kane. Joe Biviano. Al Beninati. Joe
Carosella. Ken O’Hara and Marv
Lansky.

Again we will try to explain the
scoring system used so that you
will know what we mean by points.
First, each team numbers its play-
ers in ability to play and those
players are paired with their cor-
i'esiiolidillg number on the oppon-
ent's team. It is this opponent whom
he must try to defeat. The game
is scored on the first and second
nine holes separately and on the 18
holes all together. One point is giv-
eii to the p‘ayer who shoots the best
score for the first nine holes. Then
they start all over again playing
the second nine holes which they
score the same way. A point is giv-
en for the best player of the 18
holes for the whole game. This gives
each pair of players with like num-
bers three points to vie for.

In case of a tie the point for that
nine holes is split between the pair.
There are six pairs of players which
gives a total of 18 points which the
team as a whole can get. As you
can see State did all right for itself
in their first match of this year.

The team wishes to thank Ben
Warrell for carting them back and
forth to the golf course.

 

Strauss Takes School Title,
Turns Back Mullin In Finals

In a shortly delayed notice
it is our pleasure to inform that
segment of the State College
population interested in ping-
pong that the 1949 cham-
peen is Ted Strauss of
the class of 1951. He de-
feated Fran Mullln. last year’s
champ. in the ﬁnals. Fran
had won by taking the ﬁnals
from Warren Noble. the '47
champ. The Sophs and fresh
will remember Mr. Strauss as
the man who paced the Rivalry
team.

Mr. Strauss is the sectional
winner of the ping-pong tour-
nainent.

 

 

 

 

Wea- J/‘oo

I! PAT JAI

Badminton practice is being held
in the gym on Tuesday. Wednes-
day, and Thursday nights. Anyone
who is interested can play at any
of these times.

Hiking Club

With the return of nice weather,
Audrey Eveleigh is anxious to get
her hiking club started. Contact her
if you want to plan a hike or par-
ticipate in one.

Class representatives have post-
ed lists of the sports that the girls
have earned during the year. In or-
der to win an award, credit must
be won for four sports during three
seasons. Check the lists now and
ﬁnish up your sports during this
season.

Softball League

The Baseball league has gotten
Well under way. The Would Bees
have already won two games, de-
feating Beta Zeta and Newman.
Newman came back and downed
Kapa Delta. The freshman team
from Western Hall beat Gamma
Kap and Chi Sig bowed to Wren.
General practice is held in addition
to the league games and a girl can
get ten hours credit without being
on a team.

With rivalry between ’51 and ’52
down into the last week, it‘s time
to look back over the year’s work.
The rivalry sports program was not
only weak but also confusing. The
class managers were told about a
game about a week ahead of time
which was not enough notice for
scheduled practices. Class presi-
dents. composing the rivalry com-
mittee. are too busy doing other
things to devote enough time to
rivalry. Why can't the WAA man-
agers and MAA representatives of
the rival classes be permanent
members of the committee.
Error!!!

The fresh girls have won swim-
ming. bowling. volleyball and base-
ball rivalry. not just the volleyball
games as stated last week.

WAA Council

Plans were formulated for a
spring spree to be held at Camp
Johnston on May 22. Ruth Matte-
son and Elly Adams are in charge
of the affair. Buses will be hired
and 50c will be charged to pay
for an outdoor lunch. A sign-up
sheet will be started when com-
mittee heads are chosen.

Bea Horth and Evie Kamke were
appointed badminton captains. The
gym will be open on Tuesday, Wed—
nesday and Thursday nights.

 

 

 

 

SL3 Nips KID-R, Ties For First,-
Beovers Down Angels, EEP Wins

Quality 01' play seems to be im-
proving with the weather as spark-
ling defensive work and strong
armed pitching chores highlighted
the week's activity in MAA soft-
bull.

SLS downed KDR. 2-1. with a
last inning rally. on the strength
of John Hopkins' 4-bit pitching.

The Suspenders dropped their
ﬁrst game of the year as Potter took
advantage of their slipsliod play
and rompcd to a 14-1 win. The still
undefeated Beavers came from be-
iiiiid to chew the Angels.

Pitching Duel

Hopkins and Dave Clark match-
ed each other with shutout pitch-
ing for six innings in what was un-
doubicdly ihe best game of the
year. Wednesday night. In the top
of the seventh. KDR bunched three
of their four hits and broke the
scoreless deadlock. SLS came back
iiurd in their half of the seventh.
After the pitcher put men on see-
oiid and first by an error anda wulk
Ted Brossoic came through with a
long single io left. When Gallagher
juggled it for a moment. "Stretch"
DcLyscr just kept running behliid
Hopkins. and slid home a second
before a well-aimed throw could
catch him. Clark only allowed 3
hits. and faced only 20 men in the
ﬁrst six innings. Winning pitcher
Hopkins i'iiccd only 19 men in the
first 6 innings.

Poitcr jumped in a 11—0 lead in
llic first two innings of their game
and coasted it) u win over the Sus-
penders chnesduy afternoon. The
"Black llil'l White" combined 14
biise~blows with 3 bases-on-biills
and 9 Suspender errors to plate 14

runs. Nolan Powell was wild. giv-
ing up 10 walks. but he was tight
when in trouble. He scattered 4
base knocks. and held the Suspend-
ers scoreless until the last inning.
Beavers Win

The main actolii in the "B"
league was between the Beavers
and the Angels. The Beavers eked
out a win. 5-4 in a fast played game
and thus gained undisputed posses-
sion of ﬁrst place with 4 wins and
no defeats. The Beavers are the
only undefeated team in the Intra-
mural league.

The Angels jumped to an early
lead with one run in the second.
This was accomplished by a walk
to O'Brien followed by a couple of
wild pitches and a single by Holli—
duy which brought O‘Bie home. The
Beavers came back with two in the
third-n buni single by Dolan,
a walk to 'I‘uuroncy and a well hit
single by Joy accounting for them.
A spurt of wildness by Kirby giving
up 3 biiscs—oii-balls, coupled with
it single by O‘Brien gave two more
runs to the Angels to put them in
the lead 3-2. The Beavers retali-
ated in their half of the fourth
with a single by Luinanna and u
long home run by Matthews to put
the Beavers back in the lead. Due
10 more wildness the Angels got
another run in the 5th to tie it up.
Then came the big ﬁfth in which
the Beavers winning run came
across with consecutive singles by
Dolaii. Tauroncy and Burt. The
Beavers held their own the rest of
the way. Matthews long homer was
the highlight. of the game.
