About Robes . . .

Today in Assembly, Music Council will ask that
the money which has accumulated in the Robe
Fund be used to buy tuxedos for the men’s sing-
ing groups (at present the men’s chorus, Operetta
and orchestra).

This Robe Fund has never been a separate
item in the Music Council budget. It was ﬁrst
started in 1945. The Council from ’44 had made
plans to include robes under the equipment line in
the next year’s budget. The amount of money not
used for equipment under this line it was hoped
would buy two or three robes each year.

In 1945 and in the three years following, no
delivery on robes was possible. In those three
years, $241.60 accumulated. In 1948, Music Coun-
cil had a surplus above the $500 amount which
its budget calls for it to return to the surplus.
$125 of this amount was requested by the mem-
bers of Music Council to be added to its Robe
Fund. After much discussion, this was granted by
SA. Now the members are asking permission to
use the total Robe Fund of $366.60 to buy tux-
edos. They plan to continue in the next few years
to save money from their equipment line until
enough tuxedos have been bought.

The aim in 1945 was for State to have a robed
choir. However, the trend in singing groups since
then has not been toward developing a choir, but
has been toward having separate groups. The need,
Council feels. is now greater for tuxedos for the
male singers. It. has been pointed out that. tuxcs
are practically a requirement for a concert by a
men‘s group, and that, while many girls have
evening gowns. few fellows have tuxedos.

Tuxedos for last year's concert were borrowed
from students and faculty, but this is a system
that cannot be depended upon year after year.
'I‘Iixes this year have been borrowed and rented
for the singers, and the money for this has come
from this year's equipment line.

A robed choir does not seem to be as practical
for State College as a tuxcdoed men‘s chorus.
There is not a question of whether .\lusic (‘ouncil
should have the fund or spend it for robes. That
was decided by the Assembly last year. lil'T, it
does seem that if Music. Council officers plan to
save for more taxes and for their upkeep, as they
(lo, their budget should have a line in it for tuxedos,
and an equipment line in which they estimate their
expenses as minutely as possible. A separate line
for tuxedos and one for equipment seems necessary.

To rent tuxedos year after year will mean a
needless loss of money. Cabinets for storing the
robes are already available in the Music Room.

The question is whether this fund should be
used for robes or for tuxedos. Perhaps on this oc—
casion SA is justified in not carrying out the orig—
inal intentions of the founders of the fund, and in
granting permission to Music ('ouncil to do the
timely thing, and buy tuxcdos.

SoLong....

'l'otlay's issue will be the last for this year. but
it is also the first for the new staff. The new
staff, whose members have worked this year under
the outgoing Senior board. wish to express their
thanks to those members. The ycai‘ has llt‘t'll our
in which we learned a lot. and had a lot of fun.
I'lspecial thanks go from us to Jean I’uivcr. who
in her capacity as editor has set a new high for
the NEWS. (ioodbyc and good lurk.

M “1: - - (MoaMy-Wp 35%)

By M. I. BERGER

Moving-Up Day comes but once
a. year. But when it..comes it brings
good cheer? No, that’s not a typo-
graphical error, the question mark
was Intentional. To be quite blunt
about the matter I am a bit dis-
heartened with what I saw Satur-
day. Of course, the moving exer-
cises on Moving-Up Day were fine.
They displayed a most commend—
able school spirit. People were hap-
py that morning. getting elected to
ofﬁce and what not—good clean
American college stuﬂ’, it was.

But the smiles, the “jolly songs,"
the spine-thrilling announcements,
and the consequential embraces of
joy and affection —- these were
merely the external, lily white fea-
tures of the day, the real pay off,
the clincher, the “blood and guts"
ﬁnale was yet to come—and it did
that evening. For Saturday night
at the steps of Draper amidst the
romantic setting of the stars and
sweet smelling flowers. the results
of the rivalry contest were an-
nounced.

That‘s all there was to it some
people might say, the results were
announced —— one class lost, one
class won. Yes. I guess one could
simply say that a class of fresh-
men were ovei'joyed. deliriously
overjoyed (and with just causei
and a class of Sophomores was de-
pressed.

Now that would be a valid and
even accurate analysis of Saturday
evening as seen by a stranger. But
to someone who has attended State
College throughout the year, who
has realized the prominent posi-
tion in school life that rivalry
maintained throughout the year—
to him, Saturday night had a
greater signiﬁcance. And that sig-
nificance lies in that intangible air
of gloom that was cast upon the
many students that evening. Those
girls sobbing. the deadncss that
characterized the supposed "dance"
in the Commons that night, the
things that were said—

R‘Ivalry in many respects is a.
ﬁne tradition—a tradition other
colleges can well be envious of—«but
the culmination of Rivalry on
Moving-Up Day. the climactic and
frenzied emotional peak this event
realizes once a year. nulliﬁes its
every commendable aspect. Rivalry

symbolizes a great deal to the
freshmen and Sophomores (yes,
even to the Juniors and Seniors);
and symbolizes a year of devoted
work, of hard-won athletic con-
tests, of sweat and toil in creating
a Big-Four and a skit, of labored
songs and cheer. And what does
all this honest and sincere effort
ﬁnally bring forth? An announce-
ment on Moving-Up Day declaring
one class the winner. the other the
loser.

The evil inherent in Rivalry is
most apparent: with the ﬁgurative
twist of the wrist a year’s effort
of a group of people is eradicated.
Instead of creating a greater
friendship and unity among the
classes. bitter animosities are cre—
ated. I am not condemning or
questioning the validity of the
freshman victory. My indictment
goes further; I challenge the pur-
posefulness of rivalry as it exists
today—I ask you to question the
matter yourselves, evaluate the
events that came to pass. Did the
joy that was ﬁnally bestowed on
the freshmen compensate for the.
Sophomores' discontent. their at-
titude of bitter revenge and their
contempt for their fellow class
tsister class. et ah?

I do not condemn Moving-Up
Day in its entirety nor do I ad-
vocate complete elimination of Ri-
valry. Both Moving—Up Day and
Rivalry are ﬁne institutions whose
inspired enthusiasm prove their
worth. But I do believe that the
one great. flaw that does exist. is
that matter of proclaiming the Ri-
valry winner.

1 therefore suggest that this
evil of Rivalry. this undesired con-
concentration and emphasis of re-
ward upon a single cup. be recti-
ﬁed by splitting the Rivalry con-
test into individual awards each
having its own significance. Iii-
stead of having one cup. have an
individual cup given for each event.
In this manner, it will be vritually
inevitable that, at the end of the
year both classes will have some-
thing tangible to show for their
efforts. Furthermore. the bitterly-
battled present point—system would
be transformed into a safer sphere
of competition.

Letter to the Editor:

I would like to apologize to the
members of Student Association
for not having the Vic in the Coin-
iiions after the Sing ()11 Moving-
Up Day. I know the blame has fal-
len on Campus Commission; and
it is our fault. for trusting the
Sophomore class. Upon the request.
by the Sophomores. for the use of
the vic in their Moving—Up Day
skit. l allowed them to take it.
with the promise that they would
be responsible for returning it in
Illllt' l'or lltt‘ dance. But. they failed
to keep this promise. Several Jun-
iors made every effort to get the
vic back. but (lllf‘ to difficulties
with janitors it was only partly rc—
turned.

Not iiiiiil Monday morning was
the vic returned, thanks to two
freshmen boys. Yes. it was C. (‘.'s
fault. because this was not the first
time the Sophomore class promised
to return the vic IIqu failed to do
so. I hope they Iillfl \yc llIth‘ lciii'ii-

The Common-Slater is given the widest latitude as
author of this column, although his viewpoints do
not necessarily reflect those of the STATE COLLEGE
News.

OUR QUEEN

Because she is not a resident of Albany, June You-
mans has been eliminated from the Tulip Queen
Contest. It's funny, but whenever Albany has asked
the college to aid in its Campus Chest and Nijmegen
drives, it never set up any residence requirements.
Contributions Were accepted from students from
Long Island and Buffalo as well as from those who
lived in Albany.

Oh well. as far as we‘re concerned, June. there
would have been “no contest" if you had competed.
OBITUARY

Since this is the last column that I‘ll be writing.
I'd like to apologize to those whose toes I have
stepped on and to thank those who have provided
me with news. And a special “Thanks” to Jean Pul—
vcr for sticking by the above statement, “The Corn-
mon-Stater is given the widest latitude . . . "

If I had more columns to write. here are some of
the things that I‘d plug for:

1. Re-evaluation of the conferences that student
money is spent for. A lot of the hot air that comes
out of some of the conferences is only good for
blowing Lip balloons.

2. Increased interest in a general
fund. ‘A grant from surplus
wouldn‘t hurt our Student
would help. along with
the Senior classes.

3. At. least one more formal added to our
calendar. Such an event around
would be especially appropriate.

4. A publicity campaign put. on by the Alumni
Association. The Association has Clone a great deal
for the school but a lack of some wise diplomacy on
its part has left a bitter taste in the mouths of than»
students whenever the Association is mentioned. I

5. Realization of a student-run cafeteria. plan. Ii
would bt‘ll-t‘lii those who eat all their meals out and
those who buy their lunches at school.

6'. An admissions committee composed of studcni:
and faculty members similar to the one at Potsdam
and ii better evaluation of prospective freshmen, W~
licar about all types of aptitude tests. Why not onc
for prospective teachers? ‘

ii. A repair job «or possibly just a daily \\'lll(llliu'
for the little green clock in the cafeteria,

'7. An investigation into the “Class Ring" situa-
tioii. All I can gather is that the Gleason Co. has
contracted to supply rings up thru flic class of 1314
How Li contract can be made for people who aren't
even here yet, is beyond mc. And if aizy Jilllltii'.s 
had trouble with their new rings. please contact Kay
Noonan or myself. i

8. A continuation of the plan. started by Ptifici'
Club this year. to provide rci‘reshincnts to the visit-
ing basketball teams.

9. Curriculum revision in our Educaiion Depart-
ment. Possibly an earlier and greater amount of
"exposure" to children's groups. In otlicr words. lIlUl't'
practice and less theory.

10. Commcrcc background reqiiii'cnicnt
one-half of the members of" Student
iiuiicc.

11. An Invitation extended to faculty iiiciiil)ci'.\ to
be guest columnists lll llli' NEWS every so often

13. And finally. I would like to see a horriblc piiii-
IsliniI-iit imposed on kidnappers.
