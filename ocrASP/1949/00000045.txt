"The Corn is Green” Promises No Cornsialks, No Hoes,-
WiitPenn Paddles Prochilo; Casi Acquires Welsh Acceni

By JANE COOK

Any great lover of the soil, or
farm life, or corn husking is going
to be disappointed if he expects
anything of the sort in “The Corn
Is Green,” the AD spring play.
There isn't so much as a cornstalk
in sight. When Earle Jones put in
the order for the window advertis-
ing signs, he definitely speciﬁed
that nothing relating to farming
was to appear on the poster. Na.-
tnrally, when the posters arrived,
there was a picture of a farmer
with a hoe, and cornstalks. Not
only the author. but now the print-
er. is out to confuse us. Just re-

member, no corn, no farms, no
hoes!
Earle’s misfortune is nothing

compared to what Tony Prochilo
runs into. Tink WittPenn is re-
quired to spank him, and she does
this with amazing skill and dex-

terity—as Tony found out. Quoth
he, after a typical seige of spank-
ings. “I’m very hurt at Tink's ac-
tions."

Don’t be surprised if someone
grabs your foot one of these days
for a footprint! Some absent mind-
ed, clumsy or lovesick person
tramped right on a freshly-con-
structed. freshly painted set, which
Joan Farrell and the sets commit-
tee had made. They are out to trap
the culprit!

The cast must be commended for
the sacrifices they are making to
insure the success of the play.
They have even agreed to rouse
themselves early Saturday morning
to be on the radio show, “Schools
on Parade" on WROW at 9:30 am.

Everything in the play is strictly
in keeping with the Welsh envi-
ronment. Miss Roberts has been
helping the cast with their accents,

and the songs which the choral
group presents, have been imported
from Wales. Authenticity plus for
this play.

Other members of the AD class
who help “hoe the corn" are Rho-
da Riber as Bessy Watty; Jeanne
Valachovic playing her mother,
Mrs. Watty; Kay Noonan portray-
ing Sara Pugh Postman; Joe Cru-
cilia as the Squire; Dan Rider
playing Mr. Jones; Marge Lyons
as Miss Ronberry; and George
Christy as Old Tom.

The play is open to the public
with top price of $1.20 for adults.
Students of neighboring schools
will be charged $.75 and a special
price of absolutely nothing is be-
ing granted to students of State
College with Student Tax Tickets.
Remember “The Corn Is Green,”
May 20 and 21, at Page Hall.

Meet Platlsburg Away,
Utica Home Next Week

By absorbing a 4-0 defeat at the
hands of Union College Wednesday
afternoon at Blocker Stadium. the
varsity bascball squad closcd a very
disastrous wcek in which they drop-
ped all three contests, This season‘s
record thus for shows two wins and
four losses for the squad.

At North Adams last Saturday
afternoon, the statesmen dropped a
heart breaker in the last half of
the ninth inning due to a streak of
wildness on the part of the local
mound corps. Bob Eich started on
the mound and appeared to be well
on his way toward his second win
of the season. Prior to the ninth
inning, hc had iillowcd only one run
on sevcn hits. and had not walkcd
an opposing baiicr. in ilic ninth,
he lost his cifcctivcncss, and hcl‘orc
the inning was ovcr North Adams
had scoi'ctl four runs without thc
bcncfii of a base hit.

the Municipal Golf course last
Thursday. The Feds emerged at the
short end oi a 9 to 0 score.

The visitors displayed an excel-
lent all round game of golf which
overwhelmed the home team. Their

and their superior ptitting on the
greens were terrific. Although

Endicott were a bit too strong.

KB, 9-8. After pitching one of the
pest games of the season on Monday
against SLS. Caroseila was nipped
for 8 hits and 8 runs by KB. How-
ever with Joe Zanchelii‘s seventh
inning home run off the pitching of
Lisker, and several fielding gems by
MaGrath. the league leaders proved
that they could come from behind.
Lang was the batting star. getting
a triple and a single and driving in
four runs.

Beavers Cop Two

The Beavers banged out a 13-12
win over the Flnks and a 20-11 win
over the Miteyinites to give them a
6-0 record and a strong hold on
first. Behind the pitching of Kirby
thc Beavers pounded the Miteymiics
all over the lot as Mathews paced
them with a pair of homers and a
siiiglc.

Potter came from behind to drop
KDR 5-2. behind the pitching of
Crookes. Yielding a run in the first
inning. Crookes bore down and
lll‘lfl KDR until the fifth when ll
single. a walk. and two outs gave
KDR their second run. Meanwhile
Potter slowly banged away at Clark
and touched him for 5 runs and ’7
hits. Besides the Suspenders slug-
fcst on Monday. in which some of
the best fielding plays of tlic ycai‘
were made by Jackson. Schlch, and
McGrath, KB belted KDR in a hit-
ting contest, 16—15. Once again Gan-
clcs had to come in to put out the
fire and although he was hit hard
several times he came through in
the end to win his second game this
year.

Finks ’l‘riumph

The Finks took two games during
the week by downing the Miteymites
iiilfl NKVD by the counts of 11—1
and 20-6 respectively. Pat Dooly got
credit for both wins. Last Thurs-
day NKVD went down to defeat at
