Dividend System
Oi Membership

Dollar Entities Payee
To Share Oi Profits
From Yearly Receipts

Under a new plan recently in-
itiated by the State College Co-op,
students. faculty members. and em—
ployees may now share in the prof-
its of the book store.

For one dollar. all eligible pet'-
sons may purchase a membership
iii the newly formed corporation.
This entitles him to the annual di-
vidend payment, which is comput-
ed by the Board of Directors.

To Discontinue Discounts

Under the new plan. students will
no longer receive a discount when
purchasing materials. but with pur-
chases of over twenty-five cents.
the amount will be recorded. and
dividends computed on these fig-
ures.

Back of the Co-op plan lies legal
difficulty with the Fair Tracie Prac—
ticcs Act which allows the maint—
t'act’urer to set the sale price for
the products. Mr. Raymond Verrey.
’.n‘.:‘..;t‘~‘.-i~" of the Co-op, continued
the policy «d‘ his predecessor in set-
ting the tiisefi.‘_‘xt percentage each
year. Not oiil_,”did this make in-
ventory difficult. but certain items
could not even be discounted be-
cause ot the Fair Trade Act.

 

Board to Set Dividend

As the C‘o-op actually has no
owner. the setting up of the actual
corporation will create unusual
legal difficulties in its creation.
’I‘his iion—protii corporation will
include a Board at Directors. to be
selected later. The Board will de—
cide the amount of dividend at the
end of the fiscal year. which ex—
tends from September 1 to August

u.

The dollar fee will be used for
the operating expenses of forms.
cards. and the IM machine. Addi—
tional help may be needed to keep
records. Undoubtedly. the dividend
return will be more than the initial
dollar. acmrding to Mr. Verrey.

Burden Lake Camp Succumbs To Welcome Frosh invasion

As Rain, Rusty Springs Fail To Daunt T

liy (‘olletta A. Fitzmorris

The Reds have landed . . . 185 of
their members took over Burden
Lake last Friday and held it against
a little rain and less sleep until
Sunday. Relax, statesmen. it isn't as
serious as it sounds. As a tiiatter of
fact. looking the class over. many
have said that this promises to be
a welcome invasion.

in this. their first introduction
to State. the Red Devils displayed
a great deal of pep and talent. The
pep just oozed out of them in all
activities, both planned and uti-
planned. ’I‘lieir other outstanding
characteristic became. obvious Sat-
urday night when they put on a
show for the tactilty and counselors.
Judging from their exhibition of
skills in music and acting. one
might say that perhaps, on second
thought, '52 will not welcome the
invasion so much.

Not only were their talents dis-
played on the stage, but also in the
way they treated counselors. ln
lit-oping with tradition. many upper~
classmen went in swimming ftilly
clothed . . . ask Sol-Lee and Aim
l,ee llrndsliuw what it feels like to
have your only change of clothes
l'ull ot llurden Lake water. incid-
entally. it you're ever minus a
clothes line use the nearest flag
pole we did. You can also ask
almost anyone what it feels like to
sleep on springs . . . it seems that
many freshmen slept on 2 or 3 inat—
tresses. while guess who went
without.

l‘i\'t‘l'_\'ll»llllu was taken in the spirit
of the game and even tho t'rosh had
to suffer a little. They Were very
liit‘e when our tired iiiliids ran out

’I‘he week-end had its serious
side. as well. '53 was formally intro—
duced to State through discussions

in group; with various leaders of
the ditl’eren‘ organizations on camp-
us and speeches by Dr. Collins. Dr.
Nelson and Dean Stokes. They also
ll'l'l the opportunity to meet their
tat-ulty advisors and other ineiiilicrs
on an informal busts.

Sunday's rain managed to damp—

lt’rosh Camp concluded with a lodge
meeting in which many of the new
additions here at State expressed
desires to return on the welcoming
committee next year.
