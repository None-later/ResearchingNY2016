Buy Security . . .

The insurance program which replaced our old
“inﬁrmary fund” system of taking care of State
students who are hurt or get sick is now going in-
to its third school year. The results have been so
uniformly satisfactory that they are worth airing.

On State College students last year, the insur-
ance company almost lost money. $8700.00 was
paid to the company in premiums, and $7176.70
was paid out by them for claims. When you ﬁgure
what the cost of keeping the books and sending
mail to‘ these people amounts to, plus other inci-
dental expenses of maintaining the service, it
seems that the insurance company must be close
to losing money.

Some four hundred and thirty-ﬁve people, in-
cluding a few members of the faculty, ﬁled three
hundred and forty-nine claims. Seventy-six of
these claims paid were either equal to, or more
than, the twenty dollar premium that had been
paid! And an average of the amount paid per
claim (counting the very high and the low) was
twenty dollars and ﬁfty-six cents. Claims ranged
from $.90 to $500.00. Two people collected the
full amount under the plan.

Of course, many people have paid their twenty
dollars for two years without collecting a cent.
But many others are still in school who might not
be, or merely have had welcome money to spend
that they would have paid in doctor‘s bills.
$7176.70 has been saved students and their par-
ents.

Art Kapner, the company’s friendly and help-
ful representative, has simplified claim ﬁling to
the ﬁnest degree. The instructions are now print-
ed on the envelope in which the policy comes. The
relationship with the company is friendly and in—
formal.

Last year one-half of the class of ‘52. one third
of the Class of ‘51, and a quarter of the Class of
‘50 took policies. Last year's mark of four hun-
dred thirty-ﬁve has already been topped by this
year's sales. increased publicity and growing real-
ization of the policy's practicality have been re-
sponsible for this.

Twenty dollars seems little to pay for the kind
of security this plan gives. Sspecially the fresh-
men may still be indecisive, because there are so
many other things that they need money for. But.
it is good money sense not to pass up the bargain
protection which some far sighted students brought
to State.

A New Leaf...

Last year the student body became more
aware than it had been for many years of
just what the student government is made. In the
airing of last year‘s debate on the proposed
changes to the Constitution which would have al-
tered the form if not the spirit of our State stu-
rlent governing system, many people made up their
minds and thought over this system which they
had never considered much before.

The decision was deﬁnitely to keep, with need-
td reforms. the existing system. This means that
this year's Association officers. having come into
their jobs with their eyes "wide open," are fully
responsible for an efficient government carried on
with interest and enthusiasm. And it also means
that the student body is responsible for its govern
ment.

Rm 0/ the Wallace

 

From all the hidden corners and
far-away places of this fair state,
a general migratory exodus was be-
gun this week. Sleek convertibles,
low-slung limoslnes, and new 1950
Studebakers. loaded with luggage
and bearing mysterious purple and
yellow seals. could be seen cruising
along on our ﬁnest highways, all
seemingly headed for the same
spot. In our modernistic railway
and airline terminals sophistocated
young men and women, expensive-
ly dressed. their two-foot cigarette
holders their badges of distinction,
could be seen casually making their
way toward our Super-Chiefs and
Constellations where they immedi-

ately took their seats in the ultra

deluxe club compartments; and 10.
there upon their baggage could be
seen the same mysterious purple
and yellow seals. A clubbier group
had not been seen for many moons.
Could it be that this lively and gay
bunch was bound for the same des-
tination? It could.

Far away in Albany. shop keep-
those in

ers. restauranteurs, and
the confectionery business were
merrily redecorating their empor-

iums as they happily whistled to

themselves their favorite tune,
namely: "Here’s to Good Old
State." And but a short distance

from all these dens of activity there
stood. tit still stands today), a ven-
erable building which was itself a
hive of energetic action. Upon this
ediﬁce did all these fellow-travel-
lers converge. their main objective
being to make chaos out of order.

Today. but a scant forty-eight
hours later. it can be said that
their mission has been accomp-
lished.

No doubt there were many ques-
tions in the minds of the casual ob-
server and the neophyte to these
scenes of complete havoc. Why.
they might Well wonder. did so
many handsome and burly mat-es
compete with one another for a
place in the unending line which
snaked its way around the corri-
dors and balls of this Inadhouse?
Why did the. elderly gentleman
keep shaking his head from side to
side as each individual stepped

eagerly up to his table? Why were
lovely.

ladies biting, scratching and kick-
ing at each other in their haste to
enter the huge green room? Could
it be that some celebrity was hold-
ing court? Was the cause of their
impatience a thirst—a thirst for
knowledge? Or could there be an-
other reason? Ther-e could.

The true cause for the mass trav-
el and subsequent scenes of man‘s
inhumanity to man was Registra-
tion Day at “Good Old State," a
day which holds nothing but hor—
ror for both faculty and students
alike. For there have been nasty
rumors that in previous years some
have entered the registration room
never to be seen again. Others have
entered only to give up in complete
despair. Rumor has it that these
same people later obtained posi-
tions in the ofﬁcial government in
Washington; in their bitterness
they have taken their retaliation
out upon the entire nation. for they
are the people who conceive of the
copious forms which other people
must ﬁll out in quadruplicate.

Our purpose here is not to pin
the blame on Maine or any other
individual or group; one cannot
blame them. Let us put ourselves in
the other fellow‘s position. It must
iwhaddya mean, it must???» be a
cruel experience to spend three
months believing that you are all
settled for the coming year. only
to return to ﬁnd out that one or
more of many mishaps could have.
and probably did. befall you. It
can be a very frightening experi-
ence to hear a professor say. every
time you step up to have a course
approved. "I got noos for ya. bub
. . that section's all ﬁlledll"; or
"That. section‘s been switched. split,
or cancelled." In this manner are
snap courses killed and phobias
born. And over on llll' other side
of the fence. how would you like
to hear. "Miss Slosh. do the girls
have to complete sbt‘j) six here on
the sheet. . where it says ‘See
Veterans‘ Administrator'???”: and
this every hour on the hour if not
more often!

So lrt's face it; some people are
thankful to i.’.l‘i out. of high school.
But noooooo . . . you. YOU had to
come to COLLECT!!!

Greetings and a big hell-o. pronounced backwards.
It's good to be backt?). Amazing how Well rested
the summer students look after all the stories of the
good times they had. Some of us worked and got
that green ﬂush, and we don’t mean the Junior Class
color. Some of the old friends are gone to other
schools because of ﬁnances. and then there are those
who fell by the weight of blue slips from the Dean.

COMMON COMPLAINTS

Seems as though registration was well handled
this year except for Seniors’ trial sheets which were
lost somewhere along the way and those endless lines
at some desks. But from all reports a slap on the
back for the Registrar and her staff for the thorough
screening that our schedules got.

STATE’S NEW LOOK
There's lots new this year . .
a newly painted auditorium . .
. new r-ed beanies . .

. a new President . . .
. a new Co~op plan
. new Ideas . . . new faces.

LOOKING 'ROUND

Some of the old faces are back—Lyle Walsh, "THE
Parliamentarian" Jim Brophy. Joe Zanehelii. Jean
Ineson. Pinky Smith. “Basketballer” Jim Coles. Bet-
ty Aim Gibson. Joe Francelio. . .

' Those little blue books that SA ofﬁcers are carry-
Ing are copies of Roberts‘ Rules. Could be our meet-
Ings will be run according to proper parliamentary
procedure this year.

That man in the ofﬁce next to the Registrar is our
old friend Dean Nelson. He‘s back at his old job
after shouldering the responsibilities of the President.
for the past two and a half years.

A WORD TO THE FROSII

You‘re new here and we know that everybody has
been giving you “the word." BUT . . . don‘t let any
“salty” upperclassmen snow you under with tall tales.
That goes for classes, politics. frats and sororities.
A good policy is to keep your eyes and ears open
and ask questions. Figure things ou for yourself.
Incidentally don‘t, feel that all the ti c taking tests
was wasted. Take advantage of the opportunity to
talk to Dr. Morris. the school psychologist. who uses
these tests to tell you about. yourself. 'Nuf said.
AN EYE ’I‘() THE FUTURE

Should have a good basketball team with both Jim
Coies and Jack Marks back. However. the team needs

support and that‘s you. Let's back them throughout
the season.

When the discussion for the inter-collegiate Soce-t-r
team comes up this year. think it over carefully be-
fore voting.

A solutloii to the graduation problem to mull over
. . . how about using the Dorm Field?
HEY YOU

Don‘t just sit back this year and let someone else
worry about. your student government. Our Pres.
Tony Pro. is initiating Ii system whereby SA mem-
bers can be a part of regular Student Council coin-
mittees. Let‘s take advantage of this chance to work
on our government. Remember. Council can use the
help and will appreciate it. Remember. too. that
there arc no closed SC meetings and it is your duty
to check on your officers. The place to voice opinions

Frosh Appear In Doubles;
Twins Create Confusions

It‘s double or nothing in ’53!
You don’t need to check your
bi-focals when you see four
blue-eyed blondes. all about ﬁve
feet. two inches tall and their
honey curls topped with devil-
ish beanies.

With the Leonard girls. who
who live at Western Hall, it’s
Joyce who rides horseback and
Janet who debates political is-

Well. they both come

used Jean and Helen Osborne
in breathless unison. "We want

up from there. “We want to

get in a plug somewhereli and
join the debating club and have
lots of fun." she concluded with
a grin.

Twins are unusual. period.
but two sets in one class are a
little short of phenomenal. Both
sets are completely identical
and faculty members will be
hard put if the girls don't. earn
duplicate marks. It‘s bad
enough getting your own warn-

Wiltse Reports
Schools Receive

CARE Money

The fund 0f $1,251.55 contributed
as a War Memorial by State Col-
lege to the CARE organization has
been spent, according to communi-
cations received during the surn-
mer from CARE. The money was
used to buy technical books for
schools in Neustadt and Vienna, in
Austria. and for schools in Bavaria.
Germany.

Receipts from CARE have been
received by Shirley Wiltse ‘50.
chairman of the CARE War Me-
morial Committee which began its
activities last year. According to
Miss Wiltse, the money was sent in
June. in check form, from the col-
lege to CARE Organization in New
York City. The fund was unallocat-
ed as to the purpose for which it
was to be used.

The choice of the organization
was to send books abroad under
one of their most recent programs.
Schools in Bavaria. one at Bam-
berg. one at Erlangen, one at Mu-
nich-posing, and one at Schwabach,
ruceived books. Direktorin Anna
.landa received books for her school

in Vienna. Austria, and Direkor
Herman Kncfer for his in Neu-
siadt. Austria.

A personal letter of thanks from
Paul C. French. Executive Director-
of CARE. to John Jennings. alum-
nus ‘49. last years president of Stu-
dent Association. rcads in part as
follows: “ . . Your funds are being
used to provide technological books
for Teachers Training Institutions
in Europe. During my recent tour
through Europe. I was impressed
with the eagerness to learn dis-
played by the students who are at-
tending schools. despite the lack of
technical books."

Additional infornmtion enclosed
with the receipts from CARE indi-
cated the lack of books which ex—
ists in Europe. One case cited by
the folder was that. of the Univers—

ity of Vienna which lost 150.000
\ohnncs.
’l‘hi folder adds: "Books are the

basic tools of rcconstrut-tion."

The book program of CARE was
(it‘\'.‘li)i)(‘(l in cooperation with UN-
ESCO. the Library of Congress.
and others.

The CARE War Memorial drive
took place last. spring. Money for
the fund (‘tiiile from contributions
by students. contriinitions by fac-
ility. and from the Big-4 fund. Fur-
ihcr receipts are expected. The re-
ceipts and letters will be preserved.
according to plans. and displayed
in the future as the record of the
War Memorial contribution.

Marcher: Storm Capitol
As Fresh Beanies Blaze

The thought of a march on
the State Capitol, scheduled for
last Wednesday afternoon. by
the pro-Robesonites, brought a
thrill to many students new to
the Capitol District.

Approximately 300 persons
participated in the demonstra-
tion which consisted of a march
up State Street hill from the
railroad station to the statue
of Sheridan. galloping on the
grounds of the Capitol Bulld-
ing.

The group presented a mu-
sical program by singing the
National Anthem and several
other selections. During this
period their placards waved
and a merry-go-round of cars
containing anti - Robesonites
added horn blasts to the din.

Amid the speakers advocat-
ing Americanism wandered sev-
eral State College freshmen,
resplendent in their new bean-
ies. As they pressed closer to
hear above the ringing oratory.
several persons began to ques-
tion the color of their chapeaux.
It was left to conservative State
to add the only “pink” tinge
to the gathering.
