Assembly will be held at 12:30 pm,
according to an announcement
made yesterday by Dr. Milton G.

arrangement, the Milne lunch hour
falls at 11 am.

Due to the fact that the auditor-

iStole Loses Shady Nooks,
Fungi [Destroy Elm Trees

Somebody cut down‘ two
large elm trees in the front
yard of Draper. It wasn’t foul
play. but some elm fungus
that seems to be spreading
throughout this area had so
decayed them that cutting be-
came a necessity.

It’s doubtful if any class ever
hid its banner in their shel-
tering branches, but every year,
come Campus Day, there are
a few hardy individuals who
“shinny” up to find out.

According to Dr. Cooper
who recommended Dr. Baker
as a source of information. who
in turn advised asking Mr.
Hidley. the trees Were at their
full growth in 1910. Mr. Hid-
ley assumes that they are very
old and anyone who doubts
this can count the rings on the
stumps. At the time when the
Albany Orphanage ocupied the
present site of the college, the
trees offered shade to children
playing underneath.

It is the hope of many that
the remaindc: of the trees on
campus will not have to fall
to the cry of “Timber!”

"Face-Lifting" For Howley;
Commons Replaces Library

So here We are in another tur-
moil. It wouldn't be State with—
out turmoils and this is a good
one. The library is going in for
a face-lifting, the library staff
is going crazy and the students
are just going.

From what can be gleaned of
the janitors and librarians ino-
body really seems to know what
is going on), the ceiling and
window casings in the library
are going to be painted. The
murals are going to be touched
up too. but who knows how or
by whom?

The librarians have a great
deal of trouble finding books
because all the call numbers are
