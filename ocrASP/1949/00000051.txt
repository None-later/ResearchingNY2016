About Newspapers . . .

“Freedom Goes Where the Newspaper Goes”—
or so says one slogan which has been adopted
for National Newspaper Week.

A special week for almost every subject imag-
inable has been named in recent years. A day for
this and a week for that have been set aside, until
the American public scarcely pays attention to
such announcements any more.

But National Newspaper Week, which begins
tomorrow, and lasts until October 8, represents
more than a commercial publicity attempt. The
week is set aside for the purpose of publicizing
what newspapers do, and the important place they
hold in our commercial, political and social life.

Governor Dewey, ofﬁcially announcing the week
in New York State, said, “There have grown up
and ﬂourished in New York State a powerful num-
ber of the greatest newspapers in the world.

“Some of them are read intensively in the re-
motest corners of the globe,” he said. “Even those
whose circulation is not so wide are cherished and
supported in their community for the high degree
of professional skill with which they gather and
present to their readers a steady and truthful
stream of news.”

The newspaper and the radio constitute the
main organs for spreading the events of the day.
They are important molders of public opinion
whose inﬂuence is not always realized. From the
great dailies in cities down through the country
journals (and college newses), papers cover the
country. At least once a week, almost every person
reads a paper.

Freedom may not exactly go wherever the news-
paper goes—nor is our “free” press necessarily
an unbiased one, but freedom is certainly not pos-
sible among an uninformed population.

College newspapers play a part, if not on a na-
tional scale, in this newspaper coverage.

And that‘s where the State College News
comes in. We‘re not influential on a very wide
scale—but still people read the NEWS in some
one hundred and ﬁfty colleges. In exchange for
the papers we send out, we receive the same num-
ber of papers from other colleges. Advertisers,
alumni, and graduates read the NEWS. Sixty of
last year's Seniors have subscribed, in order to
keep up on what goes on at State.

Most important, approximately 1400 State stu-
dents read the NEWS every Friday.

Like the pennies that make dollars, we‘re a
small part, but college newspapers are important
in the scheme of newspaper coverage in this
country.

And About Us . . .

We'll be a better spreader of information, if
we can arrive at a system for getting news from
heads of organizations. The Sophomore reporters
for the NEWS are assigned a certain “beat” each
week, including organization heads, faculty, the
Office of the Registrar. and so forth. Frequently
however, in this crowded school, people who are
in charge of an event are not to be found, or
don‘t answer their notes.

Most organizations want publicity. Why not, in
every organization, have one person designated to
get the news of its activities to the paper. News
can be left in the i’.(). or sent by student mail. The
word is cooperation.

Boom—Boom—and the needle of
the seismograph spun crazin from
side to side. . .

Opening the top of my steamer
trunk—rather a misnomer because
it has never seen a drop of ocean
water—I unconsciously disturbed a
sharp-fanged moth. gleefully di-
gesting a slightly worn sleeve of
my G. I. battle Jacket. Yet, my
reason for opening the trunk was
quite serious: The papers were
screaming “She's got it—too—Let’s
double our Security Measures—Arm
faster—stockpile more Hiroshima
ﬁre-crackers" and so on . . .

Were we really surprised? The
President of the United States
wasn't! The top military leaders of
the Atlantic - and - Non - Atlantic-
Pact-nations weren‘t! Even the
scientists weren't! And they stated,
again, that the common denomin-
ator of our supposedly superior
power had rested, till now. on a
four letter word—TIME. Now that
was gone—too.

Well, back to the half-ﬁlled moth

. Should I let him ﬁnish his
meal? Why not; it isn‘t often that
the little creature can have himself
a 100% woolen meal—on the sleeve
But my reasons for allowing the
little gourmet his Bout-ﬁll are bas-
ed on the following nsumptions:
One. that the Atomic Bomb poli-
ticians—on both sides—are fully
cognizant of the weapon's destruc-
tive power; Bikini is still unﬁt for
human habitation, approximately
three years after the blllowy mush-
room rose skyward . Two, if
either side is the least historically
minded—and today it is becoming

a decided virtue to achieve such
maturity —- they might thumb

Iand ,Ire-examine its deadly con-
clusions: When one side uses such
a lethal weapon the other side us-
ually retaliates. Result: Both sides

again . . . but. unfortunately, the
after effects of this brief indulgence
in mass-murder are still observable

man lung sanitariums. open. I am
sure. for inspection at all times . . .
And, lastly, discussions have al-
ready re-opened in the United Na-
tions Atomic Energy Group on
control of the bomb . . . with an
excellent chance that both sides
may become a bit educated on the
missile's life-preserving rather than
life-destroying possibilities.
Sooooooo——little moth! eat away:
for my belief is that you won‘t be
disturbed, again, for a long time.

To The Editor:

HATS OFF TO THE CO-OP.
Students report 60 second service
on all books. That's what Webster
called “COOPeration.”

It's interesting to observe that
labor has won its present fight for
longer vacations. It would appear
by the timely work on the library
the proletariat is now enjoying
summers of leisure.

Satirically yours.

Gammon-$141»

By EADE and SCHULTZE _—._

The Common-Stator is given the widest latitude as
author of this column, although his viewpoints do
not necessarily reflect those of the STATE COLan-III
News.

 

Judging from the return of the usual worried ex-
pressions and fading tans. college is going full swing
and a full week of Ye Olde Grind has passed.

IN PASSING . . .

Seems as though rushing for frats and sororities

during the first semester had some advantages after
all. It doesn’t look as though the upperclassmen are
getting as well acquainted with the frosh as in past
years. Or is it just that the years are taking their
toll and as Juniors, we don’t get around much any
mo'.
A record has been set by the seating chart com-
mittee this year in that they have the chart ready in
the ﬁrst two weeks of the year. Orchids or onions
are due to the committee according to how you feel
aiaout the attending of the weekly gatherings of the
c an.

MYSTERIES OF THE WEEK . . .

The case of the missing platters . . . Reports from
Campus Commission show that at least twenty ree-
ords used in the Commons by them for the noon-
hour dance sessions were found missing over the
summer. This will undoubtedly be noticeable when
the Commons is opened again for social gatherings
and “there ain‘t nobody here but us chickens."

What will be the drawing card at the President‘s
Reception this weekend? We‘re willing to bet that
a record number of people will be present.

THIS MIGHT BE CALLEI) A
FLUSH-FLUSH SUBJECT . . .

Paddy, after an investigation of the men‘s locker
rooms, reports that 6 out of 10 people apparently
don‘t know the workings of the plumbing facilities
and requests that the situation be rectiﬁed. .

SOCCER

Far be it from us to condemn or discourage inter-
collegiate sports that will put State into the spot-
light BUT , if soccer gets the appropriaion asked
for today in assembly. MAA will be receiving approx—
imately one~half of our budget. The question is—are
the returns from these games enough to warrant it?
It's up to you.

FRAME-UP . . .

Plans are being Inade for the “Frame-Up" of our
CARE project. No. it isn't as bad as it sounds. Lct-
ters received from the CARE organizations in New
York and also from the colleges in Europe who re-
ceived our books are now in the possession of Stu-
dent Council and it has been suggested that. when
the new Student Union is built that they be framed
and put on display. This seems to be a living as well
as a tangible war memorial.

A GANDElt AT ()Ult GOVERNMENT . . .

At Student Council meeting this week a stranger
walked in on the meeting and asked if he could sit
in on it. It turned out that he was a grad student
here and had been a scholar of student government.
at Northwestern University. The meeting in our esti-
mation was a good example of our student govern-
Inent. A lot was accomplished and all without train
whistles and tracks.

A LINE ABOUT LINES . . .

All of us no doubt are rather tired of waiting in
lines but we heard of some people who thought thcy
would beat the situation. The story goes thusly . . .
some jokester wrote on the Co-op blackboard that
the aforementioned place would be open from :3
am. to 12 p.m. midnight. Accordingly some students
were present. bright and early at 5 ant. outside thc
door waiting for books. What we'd like to know Is

. what time did they get in to get. thcir books.
Also on the same subject. Ray Vcrrey says that under
this new system of purchasingr books, many have
been found missing . . . and they're not. in the lost
and found items of Campus Commission.

Have. a nice wrwk-cnd,
too much tea at RPI.

Co-Op Moves Bookshop

To Tunnels Of Husied

It may be of interest to those
State College students who stood
on book lines for the ﬁrst week
of their 1949-1950 college year,
that on one day $5,000 worth
of books were sold. That meant
that approximately 1,250 books
on that day Were asked for,
checked off, and paid for. And
it just so happens that that day
was the one on which Mr. Verrey
well-known to the residents of
VanDerzee, as well as to the
customers of the Co-op, threw
the book-buying business out of
the Co-op. and into the tunnels
of Husted.

That it was a praise-worthy
toss. there can be little argu-
ment. Literally hundreds of
books and students can now get
together in less time than it
took to move one foot ahead in
the “book-line" of last week.

Part of the cause of this rec-
ord crowding for books may be
attributed to the fact that many
of them were ordered early, and
were here. ready to be bought,
before we students got back to
college.

If any students are still un-
willing to “buck the line" for
books. let them visit the cafe-
teria-style bookshop in lower
Husted.

Sororities, KB

Sororities on campus have elect-
ed additional representatives to the

Shaffer Indian Summer Daze

The British housewife “Queues

At State, it’s “End of the line, Bubl
I've been here since 1:30." Whether
at the Boul to catch Charlie’s at-
tention for a. cold combo on rye, or
at the President's reception tonight,
the one behind the other system
will prevail! Habit-forming. isn’t
it?

Indian summer at State seems to
have everyone exhausting the lo-
cal supplies of Kleenex. Even Joe,
the little man who ﬂxes State's
shoes, (girls' for free. men for
double) is sniffling. Speaking of
Joe, who else imparts a dose of
good advice with every pair of re-
claimed loafers?

This semester’s crop of practice
teachers have that “Milne look” al-
ready. Then there was the class in
typing when the kids took out the
rolls of their machines and played
catch. Yes, others have the bag-
gard look that comes from skipping
breakfast to make connections to
West Flatbush-on-the-Hudson. Ev-
en Junior Ed. 10, (OK, Ed. 22, but
tradition is strong at Statei) isn't
that bad. (But wait till next year,

SMILES Plan

Susan Panek. '51, President of
SMILES has released tentative
plans for the coming year for that
organization. Miss Panek has
scheduled an autumn picnic dur-
ing October to welcome and ac-
quaint all freshmen with the chil-
dren at the Home. This picnic will
also enable the children to see
their friends among the upper
classmen.

Work for SMILES will be carried
on by committees. each committee
being in charge Of a certain ac—
tivity. As in the past, each week-
end will be taken up with some
kind of entertainment for the chil-
dren—hikes, excursions to a place
of interest in Albany, swimming

groups, and picnics. Study hours,
during which SMILES members
will help the children with their

homework, are being planned for
the coming year.

Miss Panek invites any freshman.
woman or man. who wants to help
out at the Home, to join SMILES
and give the kids all the attention
they need.

Could be that the orders for Ped
pictures (where it says in small
print to look like a future teacher
when facing Dick Dickstein’s cam-
era) will continue after the Fed is
all autographed? Any stranger
might think this was Syracuse U.
judging by the white bucks and bold
looks parading through the upper
peristyle for a quick smoke before
that four hour lab.

The full program has invaded
even the august portals of the Mys-
kania apartments. Numbers one
and two provided a festive air
with servings of spaghetti, cooked
by said individuals last Tuesday
night. Rumors of lamb chops for
next week are circulating. Maybe
instead of English, French. Gil‘ls‘
Athletics and Industrial Arts for
$2,100, in Alaska, these enterprising
wheels can become cooks at Joe's
Bennery and retire in ten years.

A funny thing happened on the
third floor of Richardson the other
day. Seems a group struggled into
Room 34 hoping to be indoctrinatcd
with knowledge. A smiling lady of
dramatic fame entered and enquir-
ed in her “Twolve Pound Look"
voice if she were in English 162. To
which a Sophomore in the front
row replied,“No. this is French 18!”
A protest from those who expected
English 26 arose, and so did both
Professor and Sophomore. And
then they say only freshmen and
practice teachers get confused!

The P.O.'s exchange rack looks
sharp, only, if you want to find
the paper from Brooklyn College,
look under out of State. Why not
wander in and look it over? You
can't get in without falling over it,
so at least its’ handy.

So ends the daze of State in its
ﬁrst two weeks. Don't worry. it
could be worse.

 

Stokes Requests
