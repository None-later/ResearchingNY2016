__by ANDREW ROSSETTI

 

This week. just as last, we were
strolling through the halls seeking
athletic information. We tried once
again to get an interview but only
partially succeeded. For the most
part our information comes from
various available records.

It seems, by way of Binghamton.
State acquired a new athletic direc-
tor tabbed Merlin Hathaway. Mr.
Hathaway, born and reared in the
Blnghamton neighborhood, played
most of his pre-college athletics at
Greene High School, Just outside
of Binghamton. There he compiled
quite a record. He participated in
basketball, football. baseball and
track. Needless to say he was a
standout performer in all the above
mentioned sports, being also very
active in extra-curricular activities.
He was valedictorian of his class
and President of Student Associa-

on.

Enters Cortland

After graduating from High
School. he entered Cortland state
Teachers College. At Cortland. as
at Greene, he was an outstanding
competitor in football, baseball. bas-
ketball and track, setting a few
amazing records. Mr. Hathaway
holds the school record for the 100
and the 220 yard dashes. In 1939, he
booted the longest drop kick in col-
lege football.

Upon graduating from Cortland
he entered the professional ranks
in football and basketball perform-
ing for Pittsburgh and Wilkes-
Barrc respectively. Being forced to
end his professional career because
of an injury, Mr. Hathaway entered
State College at Albany to complete
graduate work. He then taught in
the Central Schools for a few years
and coached basketball, baseball and
football. Incidentally, in '41-'42 and
'42-'43 he coached championship
teams in football and basketball. In
1944 he came to Milne as athletic

At present they are practicing in
gym stilts. sneakers, and without
the aid of shin guards or shoes.
