Recommends Plan Throughlanguage For World CoOperation

When the United States post at
Casablanca was being closed in Au-
gust 1945, Naval Lieutenant (s.g.)
Willard E. Skidmore, was up for re-
assignment. His records showed-that
he had knowledge of German and
since the famed NueIrmberg trials
were in the process of preparation,
he was transferred to Paris.

There, aiter tests to determine his
fluency in the German language, he
was assigned to the translation of
documents, files, and records con-
fiscated from Nazi offices.

At present, Dr. Skidmore may be
found in Room 11, Richardson, a
far cry from Dachau.

Outstanding, in the opinion of
Dr. Skidmore. is the complete lack
of regard for the individual as ex-
pressed in the documents that he
translated. Forty volumes of rec-
ords, seized from the office of the
Governor General of Poland, show
the policy making behind the atro-
city campaign in that country. At
the trial, this Governor made a
statement that he never had been
an anti-Semlte, while in the trans-
lated records appeared a speech in
which he declared that the some
three and one-half million Jews in

Poland should be uprooted and lit-
erally abolished.

Few of the lawyers who prepared
the case were bi-lingual. Dr. Skid-
more assisted with both German
and a few French translations. Ob-
scure points, upon which the con-
viction of various men rested, were
sorted out of countless records and
books. One group, a pictoral record
of the atrocities of an S8. raid on
Warsaw, was condemning in itself.

Medical experiments carried on
at Dachau camp included tests of
endurance, according to doctors’ re-
ports. Prisoners Were subjected to
tests of pressure changes simulating
drops in altitudes, wet and dry cold
tortures, and to inocculations of
malaria for cure research. None of
these persons was given a chance
for survival.

The interpreters were given ample
opportunity to delve into the true
core of Nazism. Dr. Skidmore has
pictures of preserved human heads,
and memories of human-skin gloves,
pictures and book-bindings.

One alphabetized list of persons
who were medically certified as dy-
ing of heart failure. in regular five-
ininute intervals, led to the arrest

and subsequent conviction of the
doctors involved.

After recounting all these tales
of horror and crime, Dr. Skidmore
relaxed and with a tone of vast tol-
eration continued, “I think there is
a lot cf good in Germany yet.
There is definitely good in their
literature and philosophy of the
pre-Nazi era of 100 years ago. The
motivation for my return to teach-
ing German was this belief in the
fundamental good of Germany.

“If the people of the world don’t
understand each other, there soon
won't be any people. Language bar-
riers should be eliminated.”

To get along with or to combat a
people it is necessary to understand
them, in their own language, thinks
Dr. Skidmore.

Annex Elects New Cllicers

New officers for the 1949-1950 sea-
son were named at an election held
last week at Sayles Hall Annex.

Robert Derue '52, was elected
President. Social Director will be
Robert Bell '52. Robert Sinkeldam
'53, will serve as Treasurer.
