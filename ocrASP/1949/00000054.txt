I
Money Again - - .

The topic of the day seems to be whether or
not we shall add the game of soccer to our roster
of sports. It has been argued that we need a fall
varsity sport, and that we are not ready for foot-
ball to be that sport, not yet, anyway. Maybe in
ﬁve or six years—just dreaming—when we’ll have
a stadium, maybe. I .

Most people would think soccer was fine, If .it
didn’t cost any money. That seems to be the main
stumbling block. Other objections——coach, sched-
ule, interest, student participation, suitable op-
ponents—these can be taken care of. But nothing
can be done without money granted by Student
Association, and also its approval which is im-
plicit in the granting of money.

Student Board of Finance did not approve the
ﬁnancial request. Student Council took no action
when the proposal was brought to it.

Confusion has arisen with this request for mon—
ev. Many people are more concerned with the
fact that MAA‘s budget will be increased by this
addition to it, than by the addition of soccer to
our sports schedule.

A percentage breakup of our budget shows some
interesting distributions of money. Forty per cent
of the budget goes to publications, including the
News, [’crlagogue, Primer, and Soapbox. Thirty-
three per cent of the money is spent for athletics.
Only five per cent of the budget is spnt on stu-
dent government, including Myskania and Stu-
dent Council. Three per cent goes for publicity
for us and the college, that is, for the Freshman
Handbook and Press Bureau. Campus Commission
and Secretarial, which might be considered ad-
ministration, take two per cent.

It is true that these divisions are arbitrary and
the percentages are approximate. Many things
could go under more than one category. For ex-
ample, most publications also are publicity agents
for the school, as are varsity sports, [')&A, Music
Council and the rest.

One of the basic questions which comes up in
this soccer issue, then, is whether one third of the
budget devoted to athletics is justified in a school
like State, where varsity sports do not receive the
interest and ballyhoo they get in big name col-
leges. We should examine this one third. Only one
fifth of this goes to \\'AA. (Our uiulei'graduate
registration is approximately sixty per cent Wo-
men). But, it is true that girls can participate as
spectators in the varsity sports which take most
of the extra money, and WAA uses some MAA
equipment.

it seems that we can afford soccer with its $887
present cost, and its probable $600 yearly cost
after this year. f)llt‘ third of the budget is not too
much for athletics. A school that is growing as
State is should be able to get for itself things that
will really be good for llit' students. On the other
hand, We should not hesitate to drop unnecessary
expenses. li‘roni year to year, budgets are hardly
ever cut. .\[any of them could be, without slow-
ing down our progress.

Perhaps, for example, if soccer is passed, Stu-
dcnt Association ming think about dropping in
the future varsity sports such as tennis and golf
which llf‘Ilt'lll far fewer people, and cost, between
them, $512.

Does this editorial belong on editorial page or
sports page? Right here, because the spending of
SA money is everyone‘s concern.

STAT! COLLIGI NEWS. FRIDAY. OCTOBER 7. 1949

 

 

VhAEPSIw,

By DON MacDONALD

 

A few weeks ago the Justice De-
partment filed a civil suit under the
Sherman Act to split the grocery
empire of The Atlantic and Pacific
Tea Company into seven independ-
ent chains. If the Department is
successful, they will separate the
sales branches from the manufac-
turing, processing, and wholesale
divisions.

The Government is not denying
the fact that the A is; P has sold
more cheaply. Rather, it is charg-
ing that the chain sells more cheap-
ly because it has used its mass pur-
chasing power to force “secret pref-
erential prices and rebates from
suppliers." As an example, the trust
busters contend that if a supplier
of, say breakfast food, refused to
sell his product to the A dz P at; a
lower price than to other retailers,
the chain would make its own
breakfast food. The anti-trust law-
yers are also charging A 86 P’s sub-
sidiary, the Atlantic Commission
Company, with discrimination in
selling. They say the Commission
Company buys up fruit and vege-
tables, resells the best grades to A
& P, and then sells the rest at a
higher price to retailers competing
with the A & P.

A & P is not; a monopoly in the
ordinary sense of the word. In the
year 1933 it had 11.6 per cent of the
nation's business, and, according to
the anti-trust lawyers, this had de-
clined to 6.4 per cent: in 1948. From
the consumer's viewpoint, the “re-
straint of trade” has taken the
form of price cutting, reduced prof-
it margins by increased volume, and
eliminating costly distributive sys-
tems by mass buying and selling.
TheSe are the very goals for which
the Sherman Act was originally
passed. It is not the angry house-
wife. producer. or farmer who has
brought pressure on the Justice De-
partment, for in so doing they
would be harming themselves. On
the contrary it looks as though the
Justice Department is starting the
suit to suppress a relatively new
form of competition.

While the Government was get-
ting things underway, A & P (lid not
sit idly by. but instead launched a
huge advertising campaign. They
wanted to put their cause before
the consumer—~the one who has been
benefiting by their buying and sell—
ing plan.

Large posters and leaflets stating
the stand of A & P were distributed
to all the stores of the chain. They
appealed to the customers to think

To the Class of ’52:

Where's your pep?

Frankly, I’m disappointed in your
vim, vigorous show against the
mighty Devils when they so calmly
walked away with a certain body
in assembly, Friday.

Wake up and live! Get some pep!
I hate to see you lose Rivalry this
year.

about what would happen if the
trust busters were successful.

I am inclined to agree With the
company—namely, when has it be-
come a crime to sell goods to the
consumer at a reasonable price and
with a maximum of efficiency? Aft-
er all, statistics prove the A 85 P
does not have a monopoly but,
rather, has brought about some of
the very aims of the Sherman Act.
Whether this vast publicity cam-
paign, which A & P is putting out;
to influence the opinions of many
consumers such as myself. will be
of any help in the final result; re-
mains to be seen.

It is interesting to note that the
Justice Department won a criminal
suit from the A 65 P earlier this
year. It was under this same Sher-
man Act. A & P decided against
fighting the case to the Supreme
Court and paid a $175,000 fine in-
stead. Undoubtedly, at least two or
three other large suits will be filed
against chain store organizations if
the trust busters are successful in
this one.

Capital eampud

By BRADY & LIEPMANN

Since tomorrow is Activities Day,
we would like to take this oppor-
tunity to remind the freshmen and
upperclassmen of a. comparatively
new organization here on campus:
State College Radio Council.

Radio Council. originally formed
as a Student-Faculty Radio Com-
mittee. was officially re-organized,
complete with its own constitution,
late last year, upon the suggestion
of its student members. The change
was approved by Student Council
and the Council’s faculty advisors.
The rc-organization was an out-
growth of the need to cope with the
increased demand on campus for
an independent radio council. ’

It is now ready to undertake its
new task: to serve as an organiza-
tion through which radio programs
can be presented to inform the pub-
lie of college activities which per-
tain both to the college and com-
munity. The second major aim of
Radio Council is to offer State stu-
dents an opportunity for radio work
in script writing. as well as in ac-
tual radio presentation through
speech and dramatics.

Radio Council's two major pro-
jects last year were its weekly radio
programs, “Capital Campus,” which
served as a common outlet for the
efforts of city and campus organ-
izations which have similar func-
tions. and a regular column in the
News which served to inform State
students of other campus radio ac-
tivities.

The plans for the coming year
include the continuation of both
the radio program and the news-
paper column. The council also of-
feI's an opportunity to those inter—
ested to acquire experience in all
kinds of radio work.

Tomorrow you will find a desk in
the Commons for Radio Council, so
for a year of interesting, profitable
and gratifying work. why not sign

 

 

up with Radio Council?

LADEES AND GENTS, I HAVE HERE

One of the neatest publicity jobs of the year done
by Dave Wetherby and Bill Reynolds for the Soccer
Proposal. They worked hard to accumulate and an-
swer all the possible questions that might be asked
on Friday and have niim-eographed them. The four
pages of compiled data are now passing around
the school. Get; hold of a copy and read it over be-
fore assembly.

 

Incidentally, President; Collins has assured the

Coach of assistance next year if at all possible.

ADOPTED

One of the recommendations made by the Class of
'51 to the Rivalry Committee last year has been
adopted. Under a new Student Council ruling, there
will be a member of Myskania and a member from
both MAA and WAA at all Rivalry Committee meet-
ings. The class presidents and the Myskania member
will have the power to vote. Could be that this will
eliminate some of the judging problems experienced
last year.

STRINGS

Good connections have proved their worth again.
Mary Margaret McBride will give SCT‘s War Memo-
rial a boost on one of her programs in the near future.

YOU’RE RIGHT TONY

Tony Pro's prophecy is proving itself. Many thanks
to President Collins for making the Commons avail-
able tomorrow for the Activities Day Program.

’SCUSE PLEEZ

This column last week stated that the MAA budget
would be one half of the total budget with the soc-
cer appropriation. The correct figure is approximately
one-third.

IN TRIBUTE

Were certain upperclassmen mourning the arrival
of the fi'osh last Thursday by wearing red and black
ribbons? According to the best sources, they are
members of a secret educational-social I?I fraternity.

GOT AN ASPIRIN?

Your student government is having headaches.
With the new assembly time, our voting procedure
will have to be changed. Considering the time needed
previously for some elections. we wonder what meth-
od could be substituted that would still ensure cv-
eryone of an opportunity to participate in them.

On the brighter side, though, we don't have any
more assemblies that will run overtime.

SORRY

All attempts to close the school during the World
Series have met with failure . . maybe we should
have gotten a TV set for the Commons as a War

Memorial . . . oh. well. there‘s always Ockies. Phil‘s.

Thirty-three years ago, girls’
gym suits consisted of black
stockings and enveloping mid-
dies. a woman’s suffrage rally
was held at Harmsnus Bleecker
hall and the State College News
became a reality!

The work of several planning
years was culminated on Octo-
ber 4, 1916, when, under the edi-
torship of the late Alfred De-
dieke, Alumnus ’18. a four page
issue hit the stands.

Tentatively dubbed “The
News,“ a contest was announc-
ed to select a name suitable to
State. Among suggestions of
“Courier.” “Gazette” and “Bu-
gle." plain “News” won out.

One of the first issues an-
nounced that Miss Mary E.
Cobb had been hired as librari-
an. The library then was in
Room 206 and consisted of most-
ly government documents.

During the third of a century
the News has changed vastly.
There are bound copies of past
issues available for reading and
comparison in the PD.

For Appearance

Miss Cornelia Otis Skinner, known
for her character sketches. is sched-
uled to appear at the Jewish Coin-
munity Center Auditorium on Mon-
day, October 17. at 8:30 p. m. Tickets
for the performance are on sale at
the Center. 111 Washington Ave-

.vtiss Skinner appeared at State
College several years ago under the
presentation or the Dramatics and
Art Association. She is not only
famous for her character sketches,
but for her sequences of related
sccncs In the proportion of a full
length play. Among the latter, she
has pci'toimcu in “Edna His Wife,"
"The Wives of Henry VIII," “The
Empress EIIgeIII‘c." and “The Loves
oi Clanlis 11." Miss Skinner has
been hailed by critics as the great-
tsl single attraction of the Ameri-
can theater.

"Monologues." the actress states,
"have to be as true as a play as to
lilllt‘ and pl.Icc. They must have ex-
actly Lllt' right amount of material.
No more and no less. There must be
character without caricature. There

Communin Colleges, 'GI" Rights, Debate Council
Both In Dreams Of Educators .

Among the current plans to bring by the states with no question as

higher

more people are the plans of the need for
State Education department to cre- to make

ate two-year community colleges,
and the program of the National
Students Association to instigate a
“Civilian G. 1. Bill of Rights.”

Under the former plan, (partial-
ly outlined to the Junior class
Wednesday afternoon in room 20)
the state and the community share
original costs of building and from
there on in, the costs Would be di-
vided among the state, community
and pupil equally.

The object or this program is
that persons wishing specialized
training could get it near at home
and by commuting, reduce expen-
ses. As yet. no concrete evidence of
this plan is forthcoming.

Last July, a committee was ap-
pointed from the NSA to seek con-
gressional approval for Federally
financed scholarships for about
300,000 civilian students.

Grounds for this request are
based on statistics that a 10 per-
cent increase in tuition is expected
this year on top of a 28 percent
rise which has been piling up since
1939. Veteran enrollments are ex-
pected to end by 1956 and Federal
funds appropriated for the G. 1.
bill could then be turned over to
needy civilian students.

Any such funds so directed to
aid civilians would be administered

Grouped}.
Students Rates

The Foreign Policy Association
is offering a student member-
ship at a cost of $1.50 to all stu-
dents at State College, according to
131'. Watt Sbewart. Professor of So-
cial Studies. The membership en-
titles a student to free admission
to FPA meetings; student forums.
which are led by experts in allied
fields following luncheon meetings:
student conferences; and specile
meetings. Also, members will re-
ceive weekly the “Foreign Policy
Bulletin."

The ﬁrst FPA meeting will be
held Tuesday at 8:15 pm. at the
Albany Institute of History and
Art. The speaker will be Andre
Philip. administrator. statesman.
and economist and a member of the
French Bar. Mr. Philip will speak
on "Prospects for European Unity."
Dr. Albert E. Corey, Chairman,
will preside. Student admission is
fifty cents. All members are admit-
ted free. The public is cordially in—
vitlcd, according to Dr. Stewart.

Federal help and ability
use of it would qualify a
student to apply.

Even at state-supported colleges
like ours, the Federal plan could
work. Since so many pepole have

good could be derived from a sim-
ilar deal for students who were too

N vy Acquires
Pryor’s Invention

A Representative of the U. S.
Navy visited State College last
week to obtain details on a Stand-
ing Wavp Demonstrator used here
for instructional purposes. Marvin
J. Pryor, Instructor in Physics, is
the inventor of this device, which
is used to instruct physics students
on the nature of standing waves.

Mr. Pryor stated that work in
the perfection of this device Still
ed more than ten years ago and
ended in 1944. State Students have
had the use of it since 1945 when
Mr. Pryor became an instructor at
this college.

The Special Devices Center of
the U. S. Navy's Office of Naval
Research first heard of Mr. Pry-
or's device at a special scientific
conference where it was demon-
strated by Dr. Charles L. Andrews.
Professor of Physics. In need of
such a Standard Wave Demonstra-
tor, the U. S. Naval Academy's
Physics Department requested that
the Special Devices Cent/er furnish
them with one. The Special Devices
Center feels that Mr. Pryor‘s in-
vention can be of great value
instructing the cadet midshipmen
at Annapolis.

Request Payment Of Taxes

Dr. Edward L. Cooper, Professor
