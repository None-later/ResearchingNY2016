By ANDY ROSSE’I‘TI

 

 

Once again this week we were
traveling through the halls of State,
but this time with a purpose. We
were informed through the well-
known grapevine that a discussion,
meeting or debate—as you choose——
was taking place in one of the
meeting rooms. We dropped in to
see what was underway and this is
the way things seem to go.

It seems that before the war a
group of people got together and
created a Contingency Fund. This
Fund served the purpose of giving
financial aid to anyone injured
while taking part in an MAA. or
WAA function. As we wore inform-
ed this never included rivalry. The
Fund, received its finances from
the surplus in the MAA and WAA
budget each year. The problem en-
countered now is that the once
known surpluses in the MAA and
WAA budgets are no more. There-
fore after the present amount runs
out there seems to be no method at
present to replenish the Fund.

Of course, at present we must not
lose sight of the fact of Kupncr's
insurance. This program covers
close to half of the students enroll-
ed at State. Along this line propo-
sals or suggestions have been made
us to securing some method of hav-
ing all students take out this in-
surance. .

Well. we have offered no solution
and probably have no legal right to
say what has been said, but just
wuntcd to add the well-known two
cents and a few facts.

What About Soccer

It doesn’t matter where you look
lhcsc du'p, it seems that a proposal
is popping up all over the place.
This proposal has taken the name
"Soccer." Many students at State
are discussing the merits or de-
mcrils of having soccer brought into
tilute‘s athletic program on the in-
Lci'collegiutc level. At present State
is not represented in the full in-
lcrcollcgiutc picture Whether or
not soccer is going to be its fall
sport will probably be decided very
soon.

By way of review let‘s present
some of the things that are being
discussed at the present time. Some
pcoplc are thinking ubout the cost
of soccer and the effect it will have
on the budget. The unswcr to this
is that soccer will cost uppi‘oxim-
utciy $800 ruising the MAA budget
from 20"; to 29"; of the total bud-
gct. Of course these figures are just
upproxiinutions and we may be
wrong. Other people ure discussing
whclhcr enough people at State
Sznow soccer or are willing to pui'ti-
cipuic hi the sporl. The answer to
the question at present is not
known. bill of course. one cun tubu—
into the ycus ulld nuys on both
sides. Slill olhcl's are wondering if

WAA Starts
Hockey League

Hockey sticks. shin guards, and
girls en masse dotted the dorm
ﬁeld last week as the State girls
began their hockey season. It was
encouraging to see so many inter-
esting people. In fact the turn out
was so large that it was possible
to form four individual teams. As
an added feature last Wednesday
night. a knight in shining Gamma
Kap armor, preceeded by a trum-
peter. charged into the hallowed
halls of BZ to challenge these ath-
letic femmes to a game of hockey.
After the details of the contest
were agreed upon, the knight‘s
horse swished his tail, and the wierd
trio rode off into the night.

At the last council meeting fur-
ther plans were made for the forth-
coming conference, the New York
State Federation of College WAA.
The conference will be held here
at State December 9-11. Approxi-
mately thirty colleges are planning
to attend this event. The purpose
of the convention is to promote a
strong feeling of unity between the
various athletic associations in New
York State colleges. Last year three
delegates were sent to Syracuse
from State and these representa-
tives realized how important con—
ferences are in furthering inter-
collegiate relations.

Now. a last minute reminder for
the fi'osh—if you want that “all-
round" outdoor look, sign up for
WAA on activities day.

Frosh Defeat Myskania
In Battle Of Century

The tin-constructed Myskan-
ia terrors were defeated by a
score of 4 to 2 on the dorm
field Wednesday when the giant
Redwoods sliced practically ev-
ery blue-blood. “Happy Hips"
Noonan insisted on playing with
a cigarette n her mouth.
“lDimpl-es" D mbleton enjoyed
air since he had difficulty see-
ing without his glasses. The
“Golden super-woman" Adams
was ready to retire after ten
minutes of play, and “Tobac-
co” Rhoda Riber struck at any-
thing from grass to earth-
worms. “Sexy toes” Lievestro
kept his toes shining despite
the ﬂying debris while "I'll
drown you in ink" Wiltse
downed ref Bill Reynolds with
a line-drive. “Keep away from
me I’m married now” Holliday
proved a terror to the frosh.
and "Beauty babe" Thompson
stopped the fresh cold. “I was
brought up in a glue factory"
Koch tangled with a few more
players.

The help of “Let's stick to
parliamentary procedures" Jab-
ion. “Daddy long-legs" Jones,
“Do or die" Webber. and “I can
run even if I am bowlegged"
Prochillo might have contrib—
ilted much to the defeated
Myskania.

After all the controversy about
the solely female excursion to West
Point on the twenty-ninth of Octo-
bcr. the trip has been formally call-
cd off because of luck of interest.
Campus Duy activities might be
largely responsible for the failure
of the girls to sign up.

Attention, class of 1950! Last
week u challenge was printed in
the State College News from '51 to

the grand 'ole Seniors: Have you
all gone off campus to do your
practice tiuchilig‘? Certainly the

participation you showed lost your
in intramural hockey has decreased
u grout deal. ‘51 already has its war
puint oli—how about it, Seniors. are
you willing to uccept the challenge?
Expand Sports Program

Expansion of the sports program
hus long been one of the most
pruiscworthy principles of our Ath—
letic Association. This year several
things have been initiated that bear
mention here. Have you noticed the
attractive bulletin board in lower
Di'upcl' near the women‘s locker
room? Lois Prescott is responsible
for the artistic urrungcinont. und
she has posted rules for putting up
appropriate notices. It is hoped
that the bulletin board may con-
liiiiie to be us "cyc-culching" us it

Soccer Squad
Begins Practice

Soccer practice moved this week
from the friendly grounds of Page
Field to the stranger turf of Bev-
erwick Park.

Among those statesmen trying
out for the squad were several with
impressive records in high school
and semi-professional soccer. Bill
Reynolds boasts a ten year playing
career in high school, college. Navy,
and exhibition games. Dave Weath-
cl‘by. who with Reynolds is tempor-
arily directing the early workouts
of the squad. has been playing for
over six years. Two freshmen. Dean
Strickland and Bill Taylor. both
have reported four years experience
with their high school teams. Most
of the other men on the team can
qualify with equally impressive rec-
ords.

The list of men trying out for
the squad includes: Bill Reynolds,
Jim Marsigiio. Dave Wethei‘by,
Jim Warden, Paul Wilbur. Paul
Kirsch. Ben Santorn, Ed Kurland-
er, Don Burt. Paul Bullock, Davie
Duncombc, Juniors; Raoul Nunex,
Bob De Rue. Tom King. Arnold
Dunsky. Ed Costillo. Sophomores;
Bill Adams. Dean Strickland. Bill
Jack Farley. freshmen.

The soccer proposal brought be-
fore student association will be
brought to a vote in Assembly to-
day. The motion calls for funds to
support soccer as a Full Varsity
sport. It has received MAA sanc-
tion. and Coach Hathaway has
promised adequate and competent
coaching for the team.

Games have been tentatively
scheduled with nearby schools. RPI,
Sicna, Union and ABC have an-
nounced that they could play in-
formal games with State. They
would be on an informal basis be-
cause thvcir schedules have already
bccn completed for this year. but
official league games could be
scheduled for next year.

Fersh Badly Hurt
As KB Loses

Intramural football has started
and as usual there is the ﬁrst week's
confusion. But outside of the in-
jury suffered by Sy Fersh the sea-
son seems off to a good start.

Last year’s champ, Potter, won
its first game by taking KB 21-0.
The Suspenders, Angels, Finks,
KDR, and the Whiskers all won
their opening games.

On Monday KDR opened the
season against the Rocks and had
very little trouble in scoring a 21-
0 victory. Bill Wiley and Bob Haus-
ner did the running and passing.
while Dunn. Durkee, and Stephen-
son were on the receiving end. Scor-
ing late in the second quarter on
a pass to Stephenson, KDR took a
'7-0 lead as Brophy scored the ex-
tra point. Hausner scored on a line
buck and Durkee caught a pass to
make the score 14-0 as the third
quarter was under way. A costly
