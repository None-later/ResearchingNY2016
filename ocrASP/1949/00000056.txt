Remember those threatening
letters postmarked “Seattle”
that “potential old maids" at
State received last year?

A spokesman for the Postal
Inspector has announced that
the source of the flood of anon-
ymous letters sent to various
teachers' ceileges throughout
the country urging students to
give up the profession and ridi-
culing teachers has been found.

Sorry to disappoint all those
who imagined they were the vic-
tims of some Communist hoax,
but according to the postal au-
thorities, no trace of Commun-
ist backing has been found.

It’s all a big secret just who
the individual was who was re-
sponsible for sending State Ed.
10 classes into gales of hyster-
ical and maybe apprehensive
laughter at the reading of the
threats to future teachers of
America.

Since the enrollment hasn‘t
dropped, the letters must have
flopped!

Activities planned for this year
include lectures, skits, games, sing-
ing of popular and folk songs from

keynote is being considered.

Refreshments will be served at second act,

the meetings.

In Reaiow

 

“Home of the Brave” at the Al-
bany Institute of History and Art
last Friday and Saturday nights
was a bola stroke against festering
anti-Semitism. Changed from the
movie theme which dealt with Ne-
gro prejudice, it stripped all shreds
of pretension from a vital Ameri-
can problem.

It's one great lack is that of a
sequel to complete the story of the
private who ﬁnds he is “the same
is everyone else" after an agony
oi wavering sanity induced by this
feeling of inferiority instilled since
olrth.

Sponsored by the Albany Branch
of the National Association for the
Advancement of Colored People,
and adapted from the original play
by Arthur Laurents, the play was
cast from members of the Albany
Dramatic Group.

State College was represented by
Herbert Holland ’52, who portrayed
the role of Finch, an Army engin-
eer, who with his buddies, maps ou
an atol infested with 15,000 Japs.
Though Holland got shot in thL
his performance was
highly commendable.

Bad? 3. Inter-group problems in
Lucrature: A Study of the Litera-
tiii'c dealing with Inter-group rela-

play is being presented in modern
dress. out as a publicity stunt or in
an effort to improve on Shakes-
peare. but only to try to interpret
Shakespeare's thinking in terms
more familiar to us.

The ideii of a Shakespearean
Road Company developed because
of Miss Webster's desire to bring
"live" theater to the small commu-

1947. she wrote to 500 colleges ask-
ing if they would be interested in

see. In less than a week, hundreds
of enthusiastic letters jammed her
mailbox. Armed with these responses
Miss Webster negotiated with 801
Hurok. who agreed to back the tour.
In September, 1948, this unusual
cuvzilcade embarked on a success-
ful career. This year‘s trip will in-
clude sonic 300 perforinauces in 34
states.

The bare facts make it seem that
the cast is basking in the lap of
luxury. but there certainly were
plenty of snags in last year's tour.
For instance. at one college the
company had to play "Macbeth" in
a converted B-29 hangar. without
stage. proscenium. or dressing
rooms. Even the washing facilities
were half way across the campus in
the Music building. The back and
side curtains were composed of
)ieccs of material. strung. nailed
or pinned together somehow. At va-
rious intervals during the perform-
ance, the audience caught generous
glimpses of the Thanes of Scotland
in various stages of undress. with
their costumes laying on the earth-
cn floor bc'ausc there just was no
plucc to hang them. And we com-
plain uboui. our Siutc College stage
and facilities!

Admission to ihc plays is dirt
cheap. in fact. its absolutely free
to one pcriormancc if you have
your Student Tux iickcl. However.
if you happen to want to scc both
plays. you will havc to pay $1.20
and $1.80 in tlic ui'icrnooii. or $1.80
and $2.40 in the cvcning.

Tickets will be on sale outside the
Commons starting Monday. On
Monday and 'l‘ucsday only. tickcis

Frosh Gain Crimson Flog,
Show Sign-Up Day Spirit

Activities Day, 1949 variety
has come and gone and there
are few who would say that it
fell in line with others of its
kind.

One freshman related later
that he'd signed up for every-
thing the Commons had to of-
fer, and that he was only dis-
appointed to find out that he
couldn't direct the Operetta this
year. He was a rare devil but he
showed true Activities Day spir-
it when even upperclassmen in
the know pledged to guard Min-
nie!

After the mad sign-up was
over, the class of 1950 contrib—
uted its banner to the ornamen-
tation of the Commons and the
Devils received their crimson
flag.

Following the Sophomore skit.
"The Ivory Tower.“ which was
all polished for the day. the
snake-dance was a grand clim-
ax. Those who survived the fire
and briinsione danced in the
gym until “the stars. withered
and grow old,“ to the strains of
an orchestra paid for by the
day's gleanings.
