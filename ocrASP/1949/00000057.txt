Not as many freshmen attended Activities Day
as might have been expected from a class that is
the second largest in the history of State College.
It is the fault of all the upperclassmen that the
frosh were not better prepared for the true pur-
pose of Activities Day.

Activities Day should not be considered solely
a springboard for Rivalry. It is set aside in the
early part of the year so that freshmen can get
into extra-curricular activities. It is planned for
October so the frosh can find out as much as is
possible, before then, about. the different groups
that function here. Some frosh are sure of what
they want to do when they come, depending, gen-
erally, upon what they have done in high school,
or between high school and college. Most, however,
do not know. For that purpose they are informed
at freshman camp what each organization does. and
its place in State life. They are given Handbooks,
and one of the duties of the Student Guide is to
set his charge on the right track regarding what
he should get into.

A healthy Student Association shottld have almost
every member contributing in some way, other
than voting, to its welfare.

How much extra activity can be undertaken de-
pends on each person, of course. But, there are
very few people who are not better off for having
at least one extra-curricular interest. Besides giv—
ing a certain balance to the life. of the student,
most activities, particularly those involving re-
sponsibilities, contribute information and experi-
ence to the student. A surprising number of people
ﬁnd their jobs. in teaching and other fields. through
their outside interests and skills.

If you are a freshman or transfer. and you
stayed away on Activities Day. you haven’t lost
the chance to get into some organization. Yoti can
still sign for any organization. just by getting in
touch with that group. Why don’t you?

The most important thing to State's undergrad-
uate activities is interested and willing freshmen
and Sophs. An important element in the life of each
student should be an extra-curricular interest. Let's
get the two together.

"Twas the nite before Open House
When all through Greek land
Every creature was stirring

And feeling grand.

The drapes were hung
At the Windows with care
Ready for the Freshmen
Who soon would be there.

Then the girls finally settled
Down snug in their beds
While visions of Red Beanies
Danced in their heads.

Soon came the dawn

And later that nite

When the clock struck seven
Not a devil was in sight.

When out on the street

There arose such a clatter

That We ran to the door

Hoping the Frosh were making the
chatter.

We threw up the window
Threw wide the door
Started to sing
Welcome galore.

Stopped suddenly , . .
As we realized

There were no Frosh
With wide open eyes.

‘ Ey MARY BORYS

 

"How come?". we all wondered
What was the reason behind it all,
And gave vent to sighs.

Didn‘t they like us?
Didn't they care?

Didn't they wonder
Why We were there?

There must be an answer . . .
Ah. . . . could it be

Second semester rushing

Has killed the.

Interest in Sorority?!?

Oh. yes, there were a few
And to those we say—
Thank you!

For coming to our homes
And deigning to roatn
Through all our rooms
With no sign of gloom.

We Greeks are so proud
Of our sororities divine
And hope, Dear Frosh
That you will. in time . . .

Come out of your books
And fall into line

Behind those of us

Who think Sororities fine.

To the Editor:

It has been rumored that a cer-
taiti group of over zealous members
of the Class of '51 over-stepped
their bounds in their orientation Of
their sister class in regard to the
sales in the Commons on Activities
Day. It seems that their "Sisterly
Affection" made them over~step the
bounds of Rivalry tradition.

I hope these “Eager Gremlins"
are well satisfied by the oiitcotne of
their misdirected spirit.

As members of the Class of 1951.
we should like to apologize for those

managed to ruin Activities Day for
those concerned.

This week's spotlight goes off-

we think iill SCT students should
have an idea of what is happening
on area campuses. Secondly. this
news may be able to offer you stig—
gestions for improycmenis or new
projects on our own campus.

There's lots new in the radio

The question is Important to all oi

enjoyment the day could have af-
forded. It is also unfortunate camp-
us organizations had to stiffer at
the hands of these few people who
displayed their poor sportsmanship
We feel this is an example of the
current mismterpretation of Rivalry.

Rivalry was originally instituted
to give Incentive to Frosit to organ-
ize atid unify the class. In taking
upon themselves the duties and re-
nponsibilitics which beiotig solely to
freshnn-n, such as furnishing sortie
of the songs used in assembly last
week. a certain few Juniors are de—
feating this purpose. We stand
firmly in the belief that the duty
of a Sister Class consists of acting
in an advisory capacity and then
only when called upon.

To the action usual in assemblies? Gone are the
“heated discussions." the close decisions on appropri—
ation of money—at least if last Friday‘s assembly is
a basis for judging. Can we blame it on indifference?
That well-known group Of people referred to as
“they” say that if you want anything passed, bring
it up at the beginning of the year and no one will
care enough about it to vote it down. How about it?
Remember, if you don't care how your money is spent.
no one else does either.

RIVALRY AND '53 . . .

Voiced around school is the opinion that the fresh
aren‘t as interested in extra-curricular activities as
in previous years. So far. to substantiate this idea is
Activities Day. Very few frosh showed up on the
aforementioned day. Maybe it was because they h-cs-
itated because they thought they were being “taken.”
So. let‘s give the devils a chance instead of giving
them the devil. Remember. rivalry has just started!

and others throw fits—sound familiar? Well kiddoes.

good to us- so much freedom for so little money.

SOMETHING TO KEEP IN MIND

Quite a few people think it. would be a good idea
to take the Big—4 out of rivalry and present it as a
joint production of the fresh and Sophs at the end

in Close Game

As the IF football season nears
the half-way mark. we find both
league races narrowing down to two
main contenders. although it is still
early and anyone can still win. How-
ever. it seems as if the Suspenders
and KDR will fight it out for the
top berth in the American league.
and the Angels and REP will bat-
tle for the National league honors.
The Angels play Potter today at
4:30.

Both KDR and the Suspenders
won two games this past week to
move into a deadlock in first place
with three wins and no defeats.
KDR has scored more points than
the Suspenders. 64 to 44. but has
been scored on twice while the Sits-

The Gorgeous Glamazons of
Gamma Kap trounced the Bevy of
Beauties from Beta Zeta with two
goals to one touchdown by the
Beauts last Saturday on Page Field.
While the Gamma Kaps‘ air raids
in the defensive proved too much
for the BZers. the latter's offensive
tactics were very effective.

In this footkey. Ior was it hock-
ball?I the starting line-ups were im-
pressive. After a stire goal for the
Glamor/i.  "ourtcsy of Ann Lee
Bradshaw. Bz "‘voalic. the two teams
really dug in.

After several quick passes tin
the well-recognizable "T" forma-
tion of Notre Dame) Phyl Harris
doubled and run several yards for
the first touchdown of the after-
noon.

Celebrating their second goal with
a chorus line. Gamma Kap‘s joy
soon was diminished as Mighty
Mnginess of the Beauts was injured
to the extent that she 'as borne off
the field amidst curdling screan‘...
She was laid to rest under the em-
erald banner of her foe as everyone
observed a minute of silence in her
behalf.

Excellence in form was revealed
in the quick. precise passes from
McCucn to Haswell: from Ahr to
Kelleher; from Fuller to Zelanis
and back down the stretch toward
Hatch and Borys. The excellent de-
fense of Minch prevented Harris
from making any more touchdowns.

Self-conscious because of the at-
tentive audience. the modest maid-
ens called the game on account of
“Darkness” amid slionts of "WE

14 Newcomea’d What i

By JEAN SEYMOUR.—

When I came to State, my main
interest was the girl's athletic pro—
gram. After asking sotne of my
classmates about it. I soon discov-
ered that WAA was just what I was
looking for.

Last year I attended Beaver Col-
lege. a girls‘ school. where they had
a very good physical education
course. Many of the girls were just
as good in sports as some boys I
have seen playing. Every season
would find the same girls particip-
ating in all the sports. Beaver had
a great team and won most of its
games. but there was something
lacking. The experienced sportss
woman never gave the average
player a chance to compete for a
place on the team. Only physical
edu'ation majors were represented.
which seemed to keep the other
girls from supporting the team.

Everyone (‘alI Compete

Here at State, an entirely differ-
ent plan is in operation. It is cer-
tainly no understatement to say
every girl has a chance to play on
it te..in or go otit for a sport. Such
a variety of activities is Offered by
WAA. that I think any girl could
find her favorite among them. The
fact that anyone has a chance to
play a sport makes for greater
spirit among the classes. Many dif—
ferent types of students are repre-
sented by their friends on the
learns. and therefore take an active
interest in the games.

I believe that WAA realizes that
a healthy body produces a healthy
mind. Plenty of exercise helps any-
one to think more clearly and to
be alert. Original ideas for the ben-
efit of sortie class project are more
likely to cotne front a student who
is able to think in a straight line
and quickly.

Another thing Beaver was lack-
ing in was an organized systctn of
giving credit for sports activity.
They (lid not have an Athletic as-
.st‘.f'luilolt comparable to 0111' WAA.
and no point system based on the
hours of participation in sports. A
:tudcnt. to get any satisfaction
from a sport. would have to make
varsity. for only varsity members
received letters.

Point System Good

I think the point system at
NYSCT is something that WAA can
be proud of. It is truly an incentive
for anyone who loves sports. As it
student gets in her hours for each
sport. she can think that at the
end of her year. she will receive
an award that will be a material
representation of her work all
through the year.

There is only one sn'gcstion that
I have to make that I think would
Improve girl's athletics. I see no
reason why they cannot be ptit on
an intercollegiate basis. If this
could be done. student interest and
participation in the games would
be aroused to a greater level than it
is maintaining now. Competition htis
always been the main spring of
sports. the more competition. the
better the player. If any method
could be found whereby girl's sports
"Olll(l be placed on an Intercollegi-
lilt' basis. I aIn sure it would be up’
preciutetl by all.

Soccer Squad
To Start Play

Orders for equipment. for State's
newly organized soccer team have
been. placed. and plans are being
foraanated t‘ establish a fall sched-
ule with nearby colleges.

Merlin Hathaway. who is coach-
ing the. soccer team, has called
practice at Beverwyck Park. The
team plays at 4:30 every afternoon.
and on Saturday afternoons from
1:30 to 4.

The twenty odd players already
out for the team have been work-
ing on fundamentals, stressing spot
passes. heading (butting the ball
with the head. since soccer rules
prevent. touching the ball with the
handsi. and dribbling.

The team is young. but experi-
enced. always a desired combination.
There are no Seniors on the team.
hence. no losses by graduation, and
the players boast an average play-
ing experience of three years. some
having played frotn twelve to six-
teen years. Roster weights show
that the team is light, but practices
have proven it extremely fast.

Offensive tactICs will employ a
formation that in soccer parlance
is called a “Standard W" or a “Re-
verse W." The five offensive play-
ers are lined in so that they ap-
pear io form the letter W. The for-
mation is simple. yet readin adapt-
able to changing situations, and
very mobile as the entire unit can
move tip and down field.

The following men are out for
the squad:

Don Burt. Dave Wetherby. Bill
Reynolds. Patti Bullock. Paul Wil-
bur. Dave Duncombe. Paul Kirsch
IAeting Manager). Ben Santora.
Jim Marsiglio. Juniors; Raoul Nu-
licz, Ed Costillo, Bob DeRue. Torn
