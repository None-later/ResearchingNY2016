Who'll You Pick . . .

“What is the Student Facilities Board? What
does it do? What should it do?”

Much confusion about the Student Facilities
Board, and the Student Facilities Fund exists.
The nominations for this ofﬁce will be held today.
It is important that the job which these ofﬁcers
will do be understood before you nominate.

In 1944-45, Student Association decided to save
money for a Student Union which would beneﬁt
all the students. It was hoped that Farrell House,
which then stood across Western Avenue from the
college, could be purchased from the Alumni
Association.

However, it was decided that luxurious Farrell
House would cost too much to maintain.

When it was found that Farrell House was not
practical, other locations, and the building of a
Student Union were considered. The possibility
arose that the State might build a Student Union,
and the drive for funds was stopped.

In the meantime, beneﬁt affairs had been put
on, and money saved from the Student Tax paid
in 1945-46, and 1946-47. Seven dollars was taken
from the Student Tax the ﬁrst year, and four dol-
lars the following year (when the present Seniors
were freshmen). As late as January, 1947, a “Stu-
dent Union Day" was still being held. An ap-
proximate totai of $25,000, plus over $3,500 in
bonds, was accumulated.

in an attempt, apparently, on the part of SA to
be extremely careful of the money, it was voted
into a fund under the trusteeship of the Benevo~
lent (Alumni) Association.

The duties of the Student Facilities Board this
year will be very important. The past few years
there has been little to do, but this year, as a
result of agitation, theirs will be the duty of being
an active committee. They will need to find out
all the information available about what has taken
place in regard to Student Union, and the exact
wordings of business procedings concerning it.
They will need to ascertain the exact amount of
the fund. Legal channels will be needed to get
that fund back under student administration,
where (with proper safeguards, and faculty or
legal advice) it belongs. This committee will need
to find out the exact procedure to be followed to
regain student control of the fund. Many other
details will need attention.

We must see to if that this money be made
available, to be used by the students for some-
thing other than a Student Union, since that is
no longer necessary.

There is no question that the apathetic attitude
towards this committee (last year. not enough
people wanted to run for it) must be changed.
Students of high ability. and particularly with an
interest in student affairs and ﬁnances, must be
nominated.

 

Nominate good candidates for this important job
today in Assembly.

STATE COLLEGE NEWS.

FRIDAY; OCTOBER 21. 1949

 

0m Man's 0W

 

 

Tuesday night the Advanced
Dramatics class opened the 1949-50
season of laboratory plays with the
unveiling of two fine productions
which made for a well-balanced
program. If the Performances of
Tuesday last are any indication,
State first-nighters are in for a
satisfying theatrical year.

This viewer left Page Auditorium
with a feeling of elation dampened
around the edges by one unhappy
incident; namely, state audiences'
chronic malady—unwanted laughter.
It is, perhaps, to some a trifling af-
fair, but it has been tossed about
pro and can for years until the
arguments are as tattered as an
over-used script. We refer specific-
ally to the inability of some viewers
to sit through a tense dramatic
scene without becoming giddy; and
when the plot calls for an embrace
of any sort, certain members he-
come panicky and act like the un-
derstudy for the “Mad Woman of
Chaiilot." This may come as a
shock to some of you kiddies, but
those osculations are vitally essen-
tial to the interpretation of the
plot; that which took place between
Miss Mann and Mr. Clements was
not in a humorous vein and it would
take a clod not to see that this
essential portion of the plot was
beautifully done; it could have told
you much of the girl's character
and past if you were interested.

All of which brings us to the
question of the years, this one and

those gone by; when will our audi-
ences grow up? We would like noth-
ing more than to see this last sent-
ence listed among famous last
words.

Dunning our smiling mask, we
make haste to say that both Mr.
Kline and Mr. ‘Furdy can take a
lot of satisfaction in knowing that
they have brought to our laboratory
sessions two very promising play-
ers. In the first play the entire cast
was a competent one, but it was
Fay Richards who walked off the
stage with the honors for sheer
dramatics; We believe that this is
an opinion which was seconded by
the audience applause.

In the second offering of the
evening Donald Putterman had the
part which anyone who thrives on
comedy would love to sink his teeth
into. Mr. Putterman's handling of
his part was deft and sure; his
scenes with Sue Danzis revealed a
grade A comedy team in the mak-
ing.
Both directors may point with
pride to the sets of their respective
plays, for each was appropriate to
the mood they established. We no-
ticed too the excellent use of stage
movement and stage pictures in
both productions.

To summarize. we doff our ear-
mqus to George Kline, Joe Purdy,
and companies; they have set a
high standard for their fellow direc-
tors to live up to and possibly sur-
pass.

The escapade started on Thurs-
day night; one of the collegians,
appropriately designated as Hein-
rich Sinutzburger, stands in plati-
tudiness ponderousity in his abode
troom, to you) at one of the glam-
orous dormitories. He has just re-
turned from the monstrous dining
room where he had anticipated
quenching an unusual collegian de-
sire—hunger. One of his cellmates
is finishing treatment of a. fork
wound in Herm‘s left hand incurred
when he attempted to grab the
last cracker for use with the “soup.”
which he wished to drink incognito.
As Herman stands in front of his
business-like. paper-laden desk, he
realizes he must make a big de—
cision. There before him lies a note
Ivia student maill inviting him to
a meeting of the C.F.M.T.I.M.R.
(Committee for more towels in the
men's room).

Also on the desk lies a large (not
much usedl Biology book bearing
an artist’s conception of a chlckeii
and an egg. He reasons, "I‘m posi-
tive Dr. X would never think of
giving us a test tomorrow. There's
one teacher I’ve got all figured
outl"wF‘.L.W. (Famous last wordsl

Continuing his contemplation
Herman thoroughly resolves: “I'm
not going to let them talk me into
staying out late tonight!" How-
ever, hours after the meeting has
adjourned, we fltid our little friend
leaving the front door of the Gam-
ma Gamma Sorority House. After
bidding his friends a hearty “good-
Iiitc," he heads toward the dorm.
only to fliid he has forgotten his
key. The only solution is to ring
the bell and wake up one of his
friends who he knows will be glad
to get out of bed and let him in.
ilc goes to his room where he suf-
fers an attack of headaches. Coti-
sequently. he decides not to hit the
books and lifts the sack instead.
Next morning while strolling to
school, he finishes dressing with
one liIInd. while glancing through
the pages of it text held in the
other. t’l‘hc important stuff has al-
ready been underlined by the pre-
vious (lWllffl'J Naturally, ilerm has
on 8:10. His only other class is at
0:10. However, at 1:30 he has a
four hour lab. The bell rings just
as oIIr hero narrowly avoids dis-
aster at dead man's corners (Robin.
Western, etc. to you). Our friend
stops to get his breath and, decid-
liig it's not worth it. heads for the
Boul for a cup of coffee to settle
his nerves. Then We find him
searching for a partner for a game
of pingpong in the Commons.

425 class. At this point he starts
working on a date for the big dance
tonight. (Women have four o'clock
hoursl. Just as he is ready to pop
the question, Dr. X calls the class
to order and says that he has a
surprise for it, spelling out Herm-
an’s doom: t-e-s-t. Herm freezes
at the controls arid suddenly feels
nauseated. His heart resorts to
spasmodic palpitations when
“Smutz” concludes he has put on
his roommate’s shirt, and his own
slilrt, with six chapters of anatomy
on the cuffs, is hanging in the
closet.

By noon Herman has recovered.
He heads for the locker room to
get his lunch, just in time for the
1 o'clock rush. After seven minutes
of struggling he ﬁnally reaches his
locker only to find he has ripped
his pants in the brittle. After pick-
ing up the gym outﬁts. coats, and
tennis rackets which fall out when
the locker door is opened. Hcrm.

finish his lunch. tiicii he heads for

Milnites. The next stop is the Coni-

snaps! Like lightning the Maulers
sweep the right end and Herman
is thrown for 11 loss. Several men
help him to his feet and send him
on his way.

It's now seven o'clock at the dorm
where Herman is next in line t'or

HOWDY . . .

To the strangers in our halls and assembly today.
They are the delegates to the Annual Press Confer-
ence being held in the school today and tomorrow.
Let’s show the old spirit and really make them feel
welcome and at home. Added note: everyone is we]-
come at all discussions of the conference.

MEMORIES OF THE PAST . . .

Remember the “Campus Day Cup Scandal" of last
year? This year we have the “Case of the Missing
Frosh Banner." Som-e naughty individual is compli-
cating Rivalry because he has stolen it from a mem-
ber of the Banner Committee. The Sophs are anxious
to have it returned in order to avoid bad feelings and
keep Rivalry clean and fair. How about helping out.
and let's get the banner back.

POSTPONED . . .

Since the medical records for the pusliball lineups
were not checked in time for the game last Wednes-
day, as promised, the game has been indefinitely post-
poned. Too bad people can't find time to keep Rivalry
on schedule.
SOCCER (per usual) . .

Come next Wednesday at 3 pm. the Varsity Soccer
team meets ABC in its ﬁrst. game at Bleecker Sta-
dium. Now’s the time to get out there and support.
the boys and see how they are shaping up.

And in passing, not a single motion for additional
funds for MAA has been refused in the past 3 years.
BUDDIES . . .

Our bowling friends at Siena are trying to chalk
up a 3 game forfeit for the State chlcrs. Seems
State failed to receive its notice for the league in
time. Incidentally. the Secretary of the League is a
Siena student.

BIG LEAGUER . . .

And who said this school didn‘t have athletes.
The New York Giants have signed State‘s own Jack
Marks for next year's baseball season.

“WHO’S WHO MAKES MONEY. LITTLE ELSE“ . . .

That's the title of an article appearing in this
week's copy of a bulletin prepared by the United
States National Students' Association. commonly
known as NSA. It points out that “Who’s Who Among
Students in American Colleges and Universities" is
a commercial publication which is out to make money.
Also the 600 colleges represented are. on the whole.
small. and so do not represent the American college.
And ﬁiiaily. many of those chosen to appear in the
publication are selected by the Administration of
tlieri college and so are not necessarily trite leaders
but brains . . . well, well. well.

UI’ AND COMING . . .

Student Council's Book Exchange seemed to solve
the used book problem very well this semester. con—
sidering the number of used books available. We‘re
sure it will improve as students gain confidence in

 

the set-up and more texts are. used again in the
same courses the following year.
IN PASSING . . .

Did you see your friends on the bulletin board

cartoon next to MAA's board?

Did you have to wait. long in line for food ill. the
Religious Clubs‘ Picnic at the Dorm Field? Too bad.
the cooperation of the Alumni Association couldn‘t
be had as in past years.

The library is now brighter with the light off than
it used to be with them on last. year.

Students Dedicate Tidbits
On Husfen’s Radio Show

“To the ice-cubes of 299
Western Avenue from the de-
frosters at 62 Willett Street. To
Mary from Joe." From 10:30
p. m. to midnight these Juicy
tidbits of sentiment are dedi-
cated to State personnel by “H.
H., Harvey Huston” of WABY.

Every week night, Harvey be-
comes better acquainted with
State as students call him. for
dcdications, songs or just to
talk to the genial Cornell grad.

When he started his “P. M.
Platter ’arty" just before the
end of last semester, he became
acquainted with Mike Cortcsc,
who introduced him to the oth-
ers at Potter House. Though he
was a Tau Delta Phi at Cornell,
lie is now an honorary member
oi‘ I’ottcr Club.

Harvey is anxious to meet
other Sororities, Frats and
group houses. His program
gives the insight on State's
“grapevine.”

WABY will accept calls any
time during- the program, either
to name. the “mystery number"
or to say “Hi!” to “Baby from
Lover-boy!"

From the East, the West, the
South, and the North, college and
university newspapers pour into the
PD. daily. From big cities, and lit-
tle towns they come in all sizes and
at all times. And yet, though the
papers represent people at places
most of us have never seen, one
need only thumb through them to
recognize their universality. Their
hopes. their problems, and their
customs are our hopes, our prob-
lems, and our customs, even though
they don't always pursue or express
them identically. Are these fam-
iliar?

“Every failure to appear in class
or tardiness in exceSS of ten min-
utes shall be considered an absence.
. . . In the case of students partici-
pating in extracurricular activities,
their permissable absence shall be
increased so that the maximum
number shall comprise the total of
authorized absences due to extra-
curricular activities."

“There is one student on campus
whose hair has already turned gray
but not from worrying over mid-
term and final grades. Richard Do-
neit, age 52, who first came to this
country in 1929 from East Prussia,
says that he hopes the education he
receives here will enable him to
find a home and a Job after he has
completed his studies."

“If there‘s one thing I can’t get
enough of here at Syracuse, it's
sleep. . . . During classes is when I
really suffer. I haven’t heard a lec-
ture in three years. My one con-
tribution to the class discussion is
yelling “here” when my name is
called. . . . I straighten up in my
seat so much that most profs think
I have St. Vitus dance. . . . The
teacher said she didn't mind my
sleeping but my snoring disturbed
the class. I don't know. I sounded as
good as she did."

Didn‘t a lot of those sound fain-
illar to you? Well, why don’t you all
drop into the P.O., whenever you
can. and look over some of the
papers on the exchange rack. Our
exchange is profuse, and if there is

. any special college you would like

us to exchange with iii addition,
Just sign up on the list in the PC.
You never know what you find when
you unfold one of these papers.

Who's Got The Banner?
Frosh Puzzle Over Loss

O.K. fellas, own up! Who’s
got the banner? The red one
that cost about $20 and has
1953 in white numbers on one-
side, that is.

Seems like this is it: On Sat~
urday, last. the fresh in charge
of his class's pride and Joy, had
it in his room at St. Mary’s
l'ark. Much later. when he came
home, some cruel vandal had
made off with it!

Freshmen have been wander-
ing around, looking for good
hiding places for their banner,
tCIimpus Day, you know) and
now unless they hide some-
body‘s red flitnnels, they will be
out of luck!

Come on, if they get. it back
there'il be a legitimate hunt!
