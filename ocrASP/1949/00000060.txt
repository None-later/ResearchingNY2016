STATE COLLEGE NEWS. FRIDAY. OCTOBER 21. 1949

Rifle Club Gels Year Underway

Suspenders Nip SL5,

Beavers Trample Lovers

Potter Tops Bulls
To Widen Lead

Going into the final weeks of the
intramural football season the
league races have narrowed down
to two teams in each league. The
Suspenders and KDR are fighting it
out for the top honors in the
American League with the Finks
having an outside chance. Potter
seems to be racmg to an—
other championship with the An-

gels giving them a run for their
money in action in the other
league.

Tuesday saw the Suspenders take
SLS in their closest game of the
year. 7—6. It was the first time this
Scored upon and left EEP as the
only unscored upon team in either
loop. Scoring early in the opening
quarter the Suspenders seemed as
if they were going to have a fairly
easy time. however. SLS fought back
and fought hard almost gaining a
tie in the last 30 seconds of the
game.

George Scorer

The victors kicked off to start
the game and held SLS. forcing
them to punt in their own terri-
tory. George advanced the ball to

enemy grounds and on the first
play from scrimmage he took
tlic ball on a reverse and raced

into the end zone for the Suspen-
dcrs‘ touchdown. George ran for
Ill(‘ cxti'a point and on a close play
inadc thc try good.

Kicking off, llic “Spcndcrs”, again
took control as tlicy intercepted a
pass. However SLS held and gain-
ed passcssion of the ball. The
game then developed into a slow
moving but hard fighting contest.
Twicc more the Snspcndcrs threat—
cncd to score but once inside the
SL8 15 yard line they failed to
gain tlic necessary yardage. Out-
side of 1hr last minute of play
SLS approached the paydirt only
once but a stubborn linc forced
tlicni back. By far the outstanding
play of thc game was pulled by
the Suspcndcrs when Tom O‘Brien
taking the ball on an end-around
found tlic SLS linc coming in too
fast to go around. Thc only thing

he could do was to retreat and
lock for an opcning. Mcanwhllc,
Owcns. who had golic out for 11

pass as a decoy. was 1cft alonc when
a run was startcd. O'Brien spotted
Owens who took a twenty yard
pass and latcralcd to Buyer who
ran another five yards bcforc he
was forced out of bounds.

SLS Scores Late

SLS got tlicir score in the last
niinutc of play when they took
possession of ilic ball in Suspcndcr
tcrritory ai'tcr lhc Suspciidci‘s
falch to niakc a first down and
did iiol kick. Coinplcling two short
passcs SLS thcii scorcd on a twciily
yard Farmer-io-l)icks pass. The
cxli'a point attempt was no good.
'I‘hcrc was only thirty seconds 1ch
and the Suspcndcrs ran ihc clock
olit.

Varsity Keglers
Edge R.P.I. 2-I,
McDonald Slors

By taking the third game of the
three—game set by a scant margin
of eleven pins. the State Varsity
howling crew nosed out R.P.I. two
games to one in the second match
of the Intercollegiate season at the
Playdium. It was Don McDonald‘s
splendid "clutch" bowling that pull-
ed the final game out of the fire
and into the State win column.
His strike in the last frame as-
sured the Statesman of the vic-
tory. In the opener. both teams
fought neck and neck until the
tenth frame when the Engineers
scored their twenty-pin victory. The
second game was a runaway for
the teachers as Bob Reno and Mc-
Donald both racked up totals of
200 or better.

With games of 196. 200. and 187.
Don McDonald walloped a 583 trip-
le to hang up the high three game
total for the young season. Bob
Reno's smashing 227 helped to
boost his total over the 550 mark.
Coming through with an 183. Lyle
Walsh aided the teachers' cause
considerably in the last game.
Dojka was the high honor man for
the Engineers with a 577 and 200.

Prior to this match R.P.I. had
becn niidefeatcd in six games. The
only team remaining in the league
yet to suffer a setback is the high-
flying Indians from Siena. State
was scheduled to bowl the Indians
in the first match of the season.
but. due to a misunderstanding, the
match will be rolled off at a later
date. Next week. the statesmen will
tangle with Albany Business College
for the first time this season. Col-
lege support. thus far this year,
has been very encouraging. but a
larger cheering section would be
grcatly appreciated. So if you have
your homework done for Thursday.
conic out, because spectator sup-
port means a lot. The time is 9
p. III. on Wednesday nights. and
the place is the Playdlum.

“Lightning” Fisk. the manager of
the Varsity squad hcld tryouts
last week to determine the team
for this season. Besides those al-
ready mentioned. Bob Dcmcrs of
tlic class of ‘53 has been selected
as lllt(‘l"ll“‘.

WII‘I'I Record Breaking Sign-Up

 

Left to right—Walt Thompson, Herb Van Glubt. Joan Collins, Don Smith.

Your new. improved rifle club is
oil to a. bang-up start this year.
Encouraged by a record sign-up of
almost forty on Activities Day, the
officers have scheduled a very ac—
tive program. Although formally
limited largely to local shoulder-to-
shoulder matches, they intend to
hold. in addition, a good many pos-
tal and telegraph matches this year.

By virtue of its membership in
the National Rifle Association the
squad is able to shoot with any
other college. school. or group so
:ponsored. This includes almost
every notable squad in the coun-
try. N. R. A. membership also makes
available thc various prizes and
honors which the Association
awards its worthys; and. incident-
ally. interesting ltems of military
surplus such as Springfield rifles.

After many tears and much
gnashing of teeth they find them-
selves realizing a much sought aft-
cr goal; included in the proposed
addition to the College will be a
shiny new rifle range complete in
every detail. With this added facil-
ity they will be in a position to
give our new members and anyone
interested all the instruction he or
she cnli absorb.

Soccer Team, On

It has been called to the attention
of the club through the Coachs'
Office that there is considerable
call from summer camps for com-
petent rifle instructors. This,
coupled with the idea that it would
be an interesting activity to spon-
sor along with high school teach—
ing. leads them to feel that the
sport would be a very worthwhile
activity for any SCT student to
take up. .

Diversities from the ordinary bus—
iness of formal paper punching are
many. After practice meets. mem-
bers often try their hand with that
quaint little weapon, the pistol.
Come down some night and find out
what liars those movies are!

Other sidelines are high powered
rifle and skeet shooting when the
weather permits us to go outside.
And. if. in the course of natural
events, an outdoor girl desires to
meet outdoor boy, they will be very
happy to sponsor the whole affair
in a completely aboveboard manner.
In other words, outings and picnics
are also on the agenda.

The club is currently meeting in
Room 101. Thursday at noon. and
the welcome mat is out to all.

day at 7:30 pm. in Page Hall gym.
Mr. Duncan. of the English De-

men interested are urged to attend

A special practice has been call-
ed for tomorrow at 1:30 p. m.. for
the purpose of emphasizing maneu-
vcrs and offensive and defensive
tactics to be used in Wednesday's
game.

Coaching Conflicts

The Coaching situation is. at the
moment. slightly erratic. For the
past week basketball practice has
bccii limited to freshmen and trans-
i'crs. Hence. Coach Merlin Hatha-
way has been able to divide his
time bctwécn soccer and basketball
drills. Now that the entire basket-
ball lcam is practicing in the gym.
I-huhawny will have to split his
clici'gics in coaching two varsity
:ports. The NEWS. in cditorlaliz-
in; for a moment, questions whe-
ihcr this condition produces top
efficiency. or best results from all
conccrncd. We do not, liOchcr.
criticize Conch Hathaway. who is
doing his bcst in a shorthandcd
situation. His noble attempts at
handling the job arc. rather, to be
congratulated. but this does not
case an already strained condition.
Though a couch must have cap—
ablc players to produce a winning
tcam. so must a team have adc-
qmitc training. drill. and supervis-
ion, it it cxpccts to win.

'l‘lic situation appears to be oiic
whcrc Stutc can have a full-time
(lillli'll {01' (Hit! Lillllll. illlfl lilin‘ 11
good chance for a better than even
winning club. or a division of coach-
ing talents and probably no win-
ners at all. Since the Administra-
tivc budget has already been sub-
mitted for the coming year, it is
almost impossible to ask for an-
other coach to either assist or work
with Coach Hathaway. Yet. from
this admittedly biased vantage-
polnt, this seems the only way out.

Volleyball Begins

Intramural Volleyball is off A to a
flying start. Wednesday night
showed that the volleyball league
will really be a success. Games are
played between 7:30 and 9&30 and
this provides a good opportunity to
get practice for the rivalry game. If
we can build up our other sports as
much as this, WAA will really have
a worthwhile yearl

General practice for volleyball is
held every Tuesday and Thursday
from 3:30 to 5:30. League games
are played every Wednesday eve-
ning- at Page gym. To date the
Pushovers have no losses and are
leading in the league while the
Pierce Ladies are in second place.
WAA credit is given for participa-
tion in these games. Also. girls who-
wlsh to get their credit for ten-
his and riding should keep track
of their hours and hand them in to
the girls who are in charge of the
various committees. For tennis,
girls should contact Flo Paris ’51, or
Mary Lou Reed ’51; for riding. Lois
Prescott '51.

Camp Johnston Ready

Last Week Camp Johnston re-
ceived a cleaning and oiling so that
it is now in good condition for
campers. Any time that a group of
girls wish to go to camp. they
should sign up on the bulletin
board so that a member of the
camp can plan to be at the camp
during the weekend. Hiking credit
may be earned while at the camp
and the number of hours should
be handed into Evie Erdle '52.

Ride, Don't Walk

Are you tired of taking a train,
bus. or car? WAA has something
DIFFERENT to offer you. A HAY
RIDE! Tonight WAA is having its
annual hayride out to Slingerlands.
For the small sum of 250 anyone
can go on the ride which will end
up at Miss Johnston's farm. We will
meet at Pierce Hall at 6:45 and
from there will catch the bus out to
Slingei'lands where the wagons will
be waiting. After the hayride games
and refreshments will be offered at
the farm. Here is a good chance for
WAA members to get together and
have a good time talking and sing-

ing. Don't let the weather frighten
you—come out and have some fun.
WAA Votes

Today two very important amend-
nicnts are to be voted on by WAA
members. Do you want only three
sport seasons instead of four? The
result would be that your sport
credit could be earned in only two
seasons. Do you think that the men
at State should have a vote in elect.
ing WAA class managers and rep-
resentatives? The new proposal
would eliminate the male vote and
leave it up to the girls in the class
to make the elections. Whether you
approve or disapprove. vote today
outside the Commons between 9
and 4:30.
'50 Accepts Hockey Challenge

Hurray. '50 has accepted the chal-
lciige of 1951 to a hockey game. It
will be coming up in the near fu-
ture and both teams are eager for
the contest. Why can't other groups
get up teams to have similar games?
We have been trying to start a
hockey league but the interest is
certainly lacking. There are enough
girls at State who can play hockey
to make a good four team league. '
There is ample opportunity for
games and yet there has been no
response. The Seniors and Juniors
now have teams—how about the
Sophs and fresh?

Hathaway Holds First Practice

The first basketball drills of the
season were held this week in the
Page Hall gyiiniaslum. Coach Mer~
lin Hathaway, anticipating an ex.
pericnced by young team. has sche-
duled a week of preliminary light
training so he can get a line on
his new freshmen and transfer
prospects.
