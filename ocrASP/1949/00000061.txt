Debate Selects
New Members

On the basis of tryouts held last
week Miss Elnora Drafahl, instruct-
or in English, has announced that
seventeen students have been chos-
en for the debate squad. Charles
Grunelsen '52 represented State in
their ﬁrst debate on October 14.
from Siena. RPI. Union and State
debaters will be at RPI today at
4 p.m.

At last week's debate delegates
from Siena, RPI. Union and State
College discussed American For-
eign Policy in the Far East. The
main theme of the ﬁrst speaker.
Edward Wallen of Siena College
stressed education of the Chinese
and a stronger recognition of China
as a nation. Neither Charles Grun-
eisen of State or Klaus Eppler of
Union College considered the Com-
munists a major threat to the Far
East. They felt the United States
should work with this group. Jes-
se Ivanhoe of RPI disagreed with
these two gentlemen, believing that
the solution to the problem is de-
mocratizing China.

 

Cast Of ’Patience’ Lacks
Dragons, Lovesick Maids

Curtain going up! Wanted:
Dragons and Lovesick Maidens.

Barbara J. Smith ’50, Presi-
dent of Music Council, announ-
ces that “twenty Lovesick Maid-
ens" are needed for the operet-
ta. "Patience" to be presented in
March. The women’s chorus has
not reached the number desig-
nated by Messieurs Gilbert and
Sullivan; consequently, the de-
partment will welcome any fe-
males who would appreciate a
part in the chorus.

There is also a lack of “Dra-
gons” in the male chorus. If
there are any men who would

care to keep the "Lovesick
Maidens” happy, notify the de-
partment.

The operetta group meets on
Mondays in Room 28 from 3:35
to 5:25 p.m. Tryouts for the
leading roles will begin in a
month.

Delegates Return Home

As Conference Adjourns
Amid tears, farewells and
many yawns, the N.Y.S.T.C.P.A.
adjourned at Albany State last
Saturday ne‘er to return until
1960. The conference followed a
well planned program, with 50

tired delegates attending. .
There were speakers galore,
and the delegates had prob-

lems galore — how can you
get more money from faculty
controlled finance boards. what
do we do when the yearbook
isn‘t “official” because there‘s
a picture of someone with a
glass of beer? There was enter-
tainment at the Playhouse and
wonderful hospitality at the
dorm and sorority and frater-
nity houses even though quar-
ters were crowded and Albany
students slumbered in more un-
comfortable quarters. And sav-
ing the good wine until the last.
there was a banquet a la Herb-
erts with  Free] presiding
at the honored table with speak-
er Van Kleeck. It all totals an
excellent conference . . . Gene-
sco, here we come in ’50.
