“Who’s Who” books are very numerous. Few
more apt expressions have been found than this
“Who’s Who.” And “Who’s Who in American Col-
leges and Universities” is an example of the use
of ,the phrase.

Lately, there has been question among the stu-
dents concerning the validity of this publication.
Few people, it seems, have ever seen a “Who’s
Who in American Colleges and Universities” book.
Niether the State Library, the Albany Public Li-
braries, or our own library takes the book. It is,
according to one librarian, “obviously to tnake
money, and of no value as a reference book.”

It has been suggested that it is used as a ref-
ence book in businesses which hire people just out
of college: Due to the fact that it does not get
into most libraries, it doubtful how many princi-
pals can use it to look up the names of prospective
teachers.

Nevertheless, this is no ﬁnancial trap. There are
no obligations incurred by the people who are
nominated. In fact, they come out one paper cer-
tiﬁcate ahead. And apparently, in other schools,
students do buy the book. Six hundred colleges
elect people to “Who’s Who” every year, and the
venture seems to be such good business that a
“Who’s Who” of high schools is being planned.

The point is, that the book has little publicity
value for the school, it is printed mainly so that
the people whose names get into it will see them-
selves in print, and it has practically no place-
ment value.

This seems a rather hollow honor for the mem-
bers of the Senior class who are involved.

Steps Ahead . . .

Things are being done. The situation in Rich-
ardson has been notorious for the last few years.
Students and teachers, jamming the stairways,
have often had to wait four or five minutes, pro-
gressing step by step down one or two flights of
Richardson stairs. People going up have had to
push through the crowd. Increase in school en-
rollment brought additional crowding to the
single, turning stairway.

Campus Commission attempts, via posters. to
speed the process were not successful.

This year a Student Council committee was as-
signed to see what could be done. They suggest-
ed the necessity of action to Dr. Collins. The
student plan proposed was favorably received by
the faculty, and we can expect soon some ex-
periments with the schedule (a few minutes var-
iation of dismissal time on second and third
floors), to relieve the pressure on the stairs.

However, staggering dismissals would not help
much in an emergency. ()ne staircase (plus access
to the peristyle roof from second floor) could be
a trap for people on the two upper floors.

At any rate, if the classrooms are to be fully
used, another exit will have to be added to the
building, and should be soon. Perhaps it could
be included in the plans for the enlargement of
Draper and other buildings.

Smile Awhile . . .

The last SMILES sponsored afternoon, when
the children of the Albany Home Opened their
doors to State students, was not enthusiastically
attended. Just because SMILES is now included
under the budget, let's not forget that it rests
on student interest in the “Home”. The most int-
portant thing for the “kids” is the attention they
get. And, the funny thing. is that the experience
is better than six classes in Education on how to
manage and understand children.

By MOLLY

From the collective mouth of the
American collegiate bellowa a sa-
cred precept: “Bccome well-round-
ed.” In a teachers' college, the cri-
teria is doubly intense. In order to
teach high school students “well-
roundedly," it is presumed, one
must have attended college “well-
roundedly.”

It does not occur to the counselor
of education that the accepted con-
cept of a complete college life may
entirely obscure the experience of a
complete personal life . . . that the
“well-rounded" student is not near-
ly the “well-rounded" man.

It might be well to investigate
the “Well-rounded" idea as it is
currently applied to collegiate life.
Here are some of its requlrments:

1) You must be ACTIVE: This
is the core of the theory. You must
be active within the college. Ac-
tive. in this sense, means belonging
to things and working for things.
The things that you work for and
belong to must be organized, and
must have a group purpose. The
more things you belong to. the more
“well-rounded" you become. The
greater the variety of your organ-
ized experience the greater
your completeness.

2) You must be SOCIABLE: This
means you must be with college

people . . . people who are them-
selves “well-rounded.” or who
“count.” If you were alone for a

time. you might. after all, forget
that you were at all.

3) You must have a full SEX
LIFE: Explicitly. a full sex life is
essential to the scheme. It means
that you shall have dates on week-
ends. You shall attend proms and

functions, and be seen, escorted, at
college affairs.

The signiﬁcance is. that, at the
end of four years of eagerly con-
scious “wall-rounding." the diligent
student may ﬁnd himself fulﬁlling
only the rusty stereotype of col-
lege Joe.

But education is life experience.
and experience, the depth and the
width of it. does not conﬁne itself
to the Joe conception. Experience
travels in two directions: outward
to society and inward to self.

The outward process in the col-
lege picture embraces other col-
legiates. The outward of life seeks
the broader rivers of community
and persons. The outward of Joe’s
life looks toward his college hymn.

The inward experience of the
“well-rounded” is inert. Activity
has pushed aside his inner world.

I only contend that we have too
long worshipped the collegiate gods
of action and accomplishment. Too
easily laughed at the searching
process and the feeling that he who
declines the furor of the college
life need not be called inarticulate.
and that the quietness of with-
drawal may be an area of germina-
tion for the mind and the emo-
tions.

If the student who has passed the
four year test of well~roundedness
can ﬁnd a world that will accept
him gracefully . he has been
doubly successful. But if he is to
ﬁnd the meanings of life quite for-
eign to his school completeness. he
may look with regret to his school
days as heralds of emptiness and
malcontent.

Last Monday afternoon and eve-
ning. for the second time, Margaret
Webster's distinguished group of
Skakespearean actors swept into
State College. To add to the festiv-
ities, Miss Webster herself put in
an appearance and gave the audi-
ence a preparatory speech.

It is pretty generally agreed that
the performance of Julius Caesar
furnished the student with much
food for discussion and the pleas-
ure seeker with an afternoon of
good entertainment. “The Taming
of the Shrew" was even more skill-
ful and as full of good hearty

Once again our spotlight goes to
hPI. this time to pick up the first
of the series of “Town Hall' lec-
tures of this year. These “Town
Hall" lectures are sponsored by the
students of RPI and present to
their audience a number of na-
tionally distinguished authorities
who speak on subjects of vital in-
terest and concern to every alert
and intelligent individual.

The speaker tonight will be Mr.
Norman Cousins. the brilliant young
editor of the “Saturday Review of
Literature,“ who is a special con-
sultant on International Relations
to the American Broadcasting Com-
pany. widely travelled. and a keen
observer of world affairs. The topic
of Mr. Cousins‘ lecture will be a
very timely discussion on “Where
Do We Stand With Russia?"

Among the other outstanding
speakers for the year is Pulitzer
"rlze winner Dr. Benjamin Fine, a
nationally known outstanding edu-
cational authority who is Education
Editor of the New York Times and
the author of many books of con—
structive criticism on education. Dr.
Fine will speak on "What Is Wrong
With Our Modern Education?" on
November iii. This topic should be
a vital concern to all of us. both as
students and as future teachers.
Even if you can’t find a way to at-
tend these lectures, why don't you
do a bit of individual research and
thinking on the problem? What is
YOUR opinion on these problems?

All Town Hall lectures are held
at 8 p. m. in the '87 Gym on the
RPI campus. Student season tickets
are $2 and a Student Season Date
ticket is $1. Take 1 ecd and take ad-
vantage!

laughs as any modern comedy. To
anyone who had read the plays be-
forehand there was probably a good
deal of negative reaction. The wis—
dom of some of its techniques was
questionable and yet the ingenuity
of its production was indisputable.

The over-all effect of the im-
pressionistic sets was one of the
most brilliant parts of the entire
presentation. There has been a lit-
tle speculation about the visible
changing of the props and move~
ment of the furniture. In “The
Taming of the Shrew." however. the
continuity of the plot was much
more easily maintained because of
this feature.

To our mind the idea of modern
dress did not spoil the over-all ef—
fect of the work one bit. It in fact
stressed to us the everlasting qual-
ity of the play and its significance
even in this twentieth century. If
this was the intended effect we
once more bow to the ingenuity of‘
Miss Webster.

Finally we come to the actual
performances of the major char-
acters. Outstanding to us in both
performances was David Lewis. His
professional ability was unquestion-
able. The character of Brutus in
the afternoon was as clear to us
as if he were there himself recre—
atlng his deed and suffering its
consequences. In the evening he
proved his versatility beyond a
doubt. As the servant Tranio he
was satisfactory and when he be-
came a pompous snob his every
gesture was as full of fun as the
entire play. In contrast to Mr. Lew-
is. Kendall Clark‘s Anthony seemed
practiced and insincere. His very
fine voice did not compensate l'or
the shallow calibre (if his portrayal.
As the head-strong Petruchio he
was a little better. Louisa Horton
was appealing and fresh in both
performances. Her portrayal of
Brutus' wife was sincere but of
course her big moment was in the
evening as Katherina. the shrew.
Her hatefulncss in the beginning
of the play was a little weak but
when she was being mauled by
Petruchio and his servants she was
indeed a pitiful sight.

All in all we take off our hats
to the company. They did a diffi—
cult job in a most skillful manner.
Under the guiding hand of the
“wonder-woman" of the tnodern
theater this ﬁne group of talented
people brought to State College an
experience they will not soon for-
get.

 

The Common-Staten is given the widest latitude as
author of this column, although his viewpoints do
not necessarily reflect those of the STAT Contact:
ana.

“THE PLAY’S THE THING" . . .

At least as far as Margaret Webster is concerned.
Thanx again this year to D&A for another oppor-
tunity to see the Marweb productions.

We were glad to see our new curtains in the audi-
torium up in time for the big doins’. Sort of shows
outsiders that State is on the ball.

And . . . did you see Don Ely in Julius Caesar rep-
resenting SCT’s troupers? Six walk—ons were his at,
the request of Margaret herself.

GIVE . . . ENOUGH . . .

Campus Chest will be starting its campaigning
for this year soon. and the committee really has
some hot rock ideas. The best one we‘ve heard is
the possibility of having the classes compete for
the total amount contributed by individuals in the
class. The winning class would be given as an award
a “class day” where all members of the class would
be excused from classes on whatever day the class
votes for and would include such class activities as
a class breakfast, etc. Sounds good if the adminis-
tration agrees to it.

PAT ON THE BACK . . .

To Campus Commission for the job they did on
rearranging and labeling the desks in the Commons
and also the “You’re doing ﬁne . . . ” signs in Rich-
ardson.

To Commuters‘ Club for the publicity on their
Soc-Hop. Every time we turn around in lower Dra-
per we get a “sock” in the face.

To the NEWS and especially Berni-e Frcel on the
success of the Press Conference. All delegates we
talked to went away with the feeling of having gained
something and also got a good taste of State's trade-
mark . . . friendliness.

WHY DON’T THEY . . .

Schedule MAA intra-tnural bowling on another day
than Wednesday so more Juniors can get to the
match-es.

Stop complaining about the ratio 0f men to women
at State According to Mr. Sabol there are 856 men
(including vetst to 930 women. Not too bad. we.
would say.

Clean the banners hung in the Commons during
the summer so they don't sag from the collected dust
on them.

IN FAULT . . .

Last week We mentioned that rivalry pushbnll was
postponed because the medical records weren't check—
ed. The fault doesn't he in the medical dept. though.
because it's almost impossible with only one school
doctor to check all persons participating in sports.

R.P.I. (AND YOU’LL PARDON
THE EXPRESSION)

. . has offered the sale of the famous 101' in—
famousr Pup to State College. This might interest
some of the females here especially since the staff
has promised to “Change the quality“ of the mag-
azme. For ourselves we can't see selling another
college's magazine-v entertaining as it. might be.
NICE PEOPLE DEPARTMENT . . .

Mary Vaughn in Room 109 Draper . . . really help-
ful and always willing to take time to help students.

For you who POre over the newspaper exchange
rack. something new has been added . un ex~
change with Cambridge University of England.
AND REMEMBER . . .

Only about ten more study days left until mid-
sems.

WSSF. UNESCO. WSR. What does
this alphabet soup mean to you?
Maybe nothing. for you have the
privilege of being able to be in
college without their help. But, if
you had to go to college where the
campus was gutted with fire and
where only the foundations were left
of many of the class buildings, if
you had no books, only scraps of
paper to take notes on, no place to
live and very little food, those let-
ters might spell out hope for you.
WSSF stands for World Student
Service Fund. the branch of WSR—
World Student Relief—established
in this country for raising money
to aid students- of war-torn coun-
tries. UNESCO, the Unitcd Nations
Educational. Scientific and Cultural
Organization, enthusiastically backs
WSSF in its efforts to restore ed—
ucation as the builder of the world‘s
culture.

After years of' fighting and work-
ing on reconstruction. touay's stu-
dents are resuming their studies
with what few facilities they have.
Maybe they have no classrooms.
maybe they can only study from
meager village libraries, maybe they
have no labs or scientific equip-
ment to experiment with. maybe
they have to live with fifteen other
students in a small shock with lit.-
tie food and clothing. Yet they do
have the undauntcd courage to con—
tinue working under all hardships
until they get. a degree. Yet an un-
believable number of, them con-
tract T. B. i'rom lack of food.
warmth and rest.

With the funds WSSF is able to
raise on American campuses. it is
able to give some aid to these stu-
dents, It sends them books or helps
them mimeogruph their own. it
sends them clothing. it sets up rest
camps for those who have contract-
cd 'i‘. 13.. ()l gives it financial aid
to the neediesi.

However. they can only begin the
relief with their present. million
dollar budget. How about it. Stale?
Will you help another student to
continue his education? Your dollar
can mean he'll have a book to learn
from. or a pair of shoes to wear
to school. It‘s all up to us who
study under no handicaps. Will you
give to Campus Chest next. month?
The drive starts on November 14.
