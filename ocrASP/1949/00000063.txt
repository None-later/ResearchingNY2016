Architect’s Drawing of Proposed New Dormitory of State College

Work on the new combined dorm-
itory and Student Union will be-
gin as soon as the State acquires
title to the property now owned by
the State College Benevolent As-
sociation. on which the building is
to be erected, according to Dr. Ev-
an R. Collins, President of the Col-
lege. Early this week the sale of
the property, located between
Sayles and Pierce Halls. was auth-
orized by the Supreme Court of the
State of New York. It is expected
that the final transaction will be
completed some time next week.

The new building. designed by
Harold O. Fullerton. Albany. who
was also the architect fo Pierce
and Sayles Halls. will be of a style
similar to the two dormitories
which will flank it. The general
construction contract of the $1,300.—
000 project has been awarded to
Sana-Rubin of Albany.

A large share of the credit in the
origin of the State Dormitory Au-
thority. under whose supervision
dormitories are being constructed
at all eleven state teachers' col-

leges. belongs to the State College
Benevolent Association. according
to Dr. Collins. Under the leadership
of Dr. John M. Sayles. President
Emeritus of the College, the Al-
umni Association demonstrated
that a dormitory can be proﬁtably
run by a local organization. Utiliz-
ing the experience gained by Dr.
Sayles and his associates. the State
Dormitory Authority was created
to supervise construction of hous-
ing units at each of the state
teachers' colleges.

Not only has the authority the
duty of construction, it has also
conducted a nation-wide check to
determine the speciﬁc furniture
needs for college students. As a re-
sult of this survey. desks and beds
will be specially designed. the beds
to have specially constructed inat-
resses, and also two large storage
drawers biillt under them. Dr. Col-
lins has stated.

The dormitory itself will be con~
structed as shown in the above
drawing. with the exception of the
walk leading across the Dorm

Field. As the present contract reads.
the walk is not included in the
plans. The building will be four
stories high in the shape of a flat—
tened  with the two wings be-
ing 155 feet by 40 feet. and the
middle section extending 178 feet
between them. The building will
have a capacity of 300 students.
with all the rooms being built for
occupancy by two people. Strident
Union ofﬁces and lounges will be
located on the lower two floors of
the middle section, with space on
the third floor being set aside to
construct sleeping rooms and
lounges to provide overnight ac-
commodations for commuters or
weekend visitors.

It is expected that the building
will be ready for occupancy by next
September.

Dr. Collins has also announced
that the bids for the addition lo
Draper Hall will be opened Novem-
ber 2. and if a satisfactory bid is
received. construction will start bo-
forc Christmas.

ABC Trips Varsity Quintet,-

Sioie Maintains

They had to wipe the blood from
the field when it was all over. But
our infant soccer team emerged
from Wednesday's fracas with new
found experience and inspiration.
Anwyay, the fans had a good time.
Old timers rere at State had to
look twice when they saw the en-
thusiasm generated by the tradi~
tionally ultra-staid SCT rooting
section. And, if that weren’t enough,
the old timers must have been floor-
ed when the inost rabid (and loud-
est. incidentally) spectators turned
out to be a contingent of soccer
minded FACULTY members.

Maybe ihe game wasn't hard and
rough. but when the referee warned
the players not to hit on the break.
the managers started hunting
around for the eight ounce gloves.
And don’t let Ben Santora tell you
that he got that shiiier because he
walked into a door.

State Scores

Amicable relations between ABC
and State disappeared faster than
the '53 banner once the game start-
ed. The boys went at it fast and
furiously, and at the end of three
quarters. the score, thanks to a goal
by Dave Wetherby. was tied at 1-1.
If the game ended there. the peds
would probably have been as con-
tented as the proverbial cow. but
rules, suh. demand four quarters to

Third Place

a game. And in a decidedly ungen-
tleman-like gesture, the cads of the
opposition scored tw0 goals in the
last quarter while we scored none.
Wait until the Sporting News hears
about thisl

Defense Strong

Our backfield played an excellent
(sic) game, however, and the de-
fensive assignments were well car-
ried out. ABC must have scored
during the time-outs.

(The score incidentally, was 3-1.
Consult the school newspaper of
Albany Business College for more
complete details.)

Another game for the team will
tentatively be scheduled for next
week. As soon as final details are
arranged. the announcement will
be made via the bulletin boards.

The starting lineup for State was:

Tom King—Right Wing.

Dean Strickland——Inside Right.

Bill Reynolds—Center.

Bill Adams—Inside Left.

Ben Santora—Left Wing.

Dave Wetherby—Center Half.

Bill Taylor—Right Half.

Dave Duncombe——Left Half.

Bob DeRue—Fullback.

Paul Bullock—Fullback.

Arnold Dansky—Goal.

The substitutes were Nunez. Cos-
tillo. Wilbur and Burke.

Roundup

 

 

Wednesday night at the Playclium.
liltt‘l‘ the first grime totals had been
summed up and the game had been
lucked neatly in the local win col-
umn. the five men who comprised
the Albany Business College bowling
tcuin looked like pushovcrs for the
Siritcsineii. The State representa—
tivcs had hammered the maples for
a total of 852, bettering the lads
from lower Washington Street by
a margin of 188 pins. Things looked
rosy for the home team. but not for
long. Before the second game had
hardly gotten under way, ABC
bombarded lhc teachers with a suc~
cession of strikes, taking the lead
and never relinquishing it. In fact.
the Statesman. in u complete rc-
vcrsul of form. dropped the next
two games by margins of 34 and 28
pins respeclivcly. The only bright
spot in the second lilt was Mike
lainiiiiiia's classy 201. but tiie effort
was in \'lllll.

the 111051. consistent bowler on the

3! PAT JAI*

Have the State girls become im-
friendly? Why are the frosh un-
happy here at State? Why have
WAA activities this- fall proved less
entertaining than formerly? [Per-
from the sports column is not the
proper place to mention the atti-
tude of the upperclassmen, but the
WAA hayride has shown that the
situation is serious.

 

 

 

Groups Formed

Usually all informal affairs such
as a hayride proved to be an even-
ing of fun and friendship. This year
it wasn't fun. The upperclassmen
stayed in their own group while the
fresh did the same. Naturally, a
few interested upperclassmen tried
to break up the groups. but their
efforts were wholly unsuccessful.

Why should there be two distinct
groups? It seems to me that the
situation can be traced to our so-
rority rushing- rules that are newly
being tried this fall. I'm not saying
that our present system is good or
bird. However. the effect on the frosh
is definitely distressing.

Issues Made

If you stop to talk to a freshman
in the hall. or happen tomeet her
at the Boul for lunch, immediately
other sorority girls start talking. If
they don't make an issue of it, you
feel that they have. Because of this
insecure feeling. the upperclassmen
feel it is a lot safer and easier to
simply ignore the frosh. The result
is that the freshmen have found
State an extremely unfriendly col-
lege, and have had to turn for
friends to their own classmates en-
tirely.

Probable Solution

What can be done about it? A
great deai~and the first step can
be taken by WAA. This organiza-
tion is made up of all the women
here at school regardless of class or
sorority. When we are out on the
field playing hockey. volleyball, or
any other sport. we are only inter-
ested in being friendly with our
teammates. Attempting to win class
and sorority affiliations are com-
pletely forgotten. and only a feel-
ing of sincere friendship prevails.
This same attitude should carry
over into school. There is no rea-
son why the freshmen can‘t be just
us good friends as upperclassmen.

No matter how the upperclassmen
feel. it is the frosh who are suffer-
ing this year. Such a change in life
and curriculum from high schoo‘ is
sometimes hard to take. If the girls
in the three upper classes tried to
act fl little more friendly toward
the frosh and stopped ignoring
them. their freshman year would be
much liiippicr. WAA has always
stood for cooperation and friend-
sliip-—~lct's try to live up to that
objcctivc.

Que“ 49am

For the fourth week we have
been running 11 contest to see who
is the foolbull expert of State (ed.
note« this does not lncldue the
football bruins— on the News sports
stuff.) Al first not too much inter-
est was shown but for the lust two
weeks i'csponsc liiis been cxcclleht.
Anyone who hus not yet tried their
skill iil prcdicllng football scores we
will explain the rules. All you have
lo do is fill out lhc following cou-
pon. with wind you think will be
lhc correct scores. leur out the cou-
pon, put ii iii the News mailbox
outside lhe PC. by 4:30 today and
wuil. The one who comes closest to
the correct scores wins ii carton of
Clicslci'i’ields. Lust week John Cho-
gui'cs was the lucky winner—no. he
wus lhc foolbull export of Stirtc.
