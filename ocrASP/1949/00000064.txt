Another trend in the educational

Exchange Exchange Editor
In Albany-Paris Confusion

As one of the duties of Ex-
change Editor, Cecelia Battlsti
'51, sent out, letters to a number
of colleges requcsting exchange
issues of their papers.

One request was for the paper
from the Sorbonne, Paris.

It was with enthusiasm that
she opened their reply; it. was
with puzzlcment that she
scanned the numerous sheets;
and it was with incredulity that
she realized they had sent her
registration papers for enroll-
merit!

Who was planning to study
at the Sorbonne? No one in the
PO at the moment had ever
heard of the place.

Plans to. study there have not
been included in Cecelia’s crys-
tal bail outline. However, since
she has the application blanks,
she’s considering it.

Somewhere in the linguistic
confusion that must have re-
sulted in changing the NEWS
letter from “Albanian” to
French. the Sorbonne gathered
they were receiving the Ex-
change Editor as an Exchange
Student, rather than Exchange
papers!

votes until one person remained
and therefore was declared elected.
