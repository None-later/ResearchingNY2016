STATE COLLEGE NIWI. FRIDAY. NOVEMBER 4. 1°49

Stokes Releases Student, One-Time Dutch Citizen,
Receives Scholarship Nomination

Moving Rulings
For Page Piano

Dr. Charles 1". Stokes, Professor
of Music, has released rulings on
the .moving of the piano in Page
Hall Auditorium, and has explain-
ed the piano problem, as requested
of him in a statement by Dr. Evan
R. Collins, President of the college.

It is to be noted, Dr. Stokes

. states, that groups planning danc-

es or use of piano in the gym will
have no piano available to them
for use. This is due to the fact
that three pianos have been de-
molished in the past ﬁve years
during the course of activities held
in the gym. The last piano, pur-
chased ln 1946, was removed this
summer, after complete destruction.
Plans for the purchase of a new
piano are being made, but no ac-
tion has been taken as of yet. Pro-
tection will be necessary for the
next instrument purchased.

Piano moving is to be done by
professional movers and in the ev-
ent of moving, arrangement will
have to be made ahead of time.
and plans will have to include this
expense in the budget.

Panek Requests Volunteers Sign
To Escort Children To Festival

Susan Panek '51, President of
SMILES, has ask-ed that all stu-
dents who are planning to serve as
chaperones in escorting the chil-
dren of the Home to the Drama
Festival meet at the Home tomor-
row at 1:45 pm. Miss Panek has
requested that students who would
like to help in this work sign up
on the SMILES bulletin board in
lower Draper.

p.m., in Room 150, Husted, accord-
ing to Donald Cohen '51, President.

“I’ll remember you in my will,"
may very well become the favorite
expression of Christiaan Lievestro
’50. Lievestro has been unanimously
nominated as a candidate for a
Rhodes scholarship by the entire
faculty of State College, according
to Dr. Evan R. Collins. This would
provide two years tuition free grad-
uate study at Oxford University.

Cecil J. Rhodes, South African
statesman and ﬁnancier, establish-
er of the famed scholarships in his
will, emphasized the value of cre-
ating in American students an at-
tachment of such scholarships to
the country from which they orig-
inally sprang without weakening
their sympathy for their own and so
fostering the cause for English-
speaking people.

Something slipped, because Chris
was a citizen of the Netherlands
until he was 18. However, he ful-
fills the other requirements of be-
ing an unmarried male, between the
ages of 19 and 25, and a college
student.

These scholarships are awarded to
students in the British colonies and

the United States. There are 32 a1-
lotted to American candidates. The
states are grouped in eight dis-
tricts. There is a competition held
annually in each state, from which
its Committee of Selections nom-
inates the two best candidates and
from their total number, each dis-
trict committee selects the four
persons who will represent the dis-
trict as Rhodes Scholars.
According to Dr. Collins, any man
nominated for the honor of com-
peting for a Rhodes Scholarship
must show outstanding intellectual,
leadership, and interest traits.

On Commencement Day last June, -

Chris was notified that he was hold-
er of the Wheelock Scholarship
which is given to the Junior man
who “shows outstanding leadership,
scholarship, and potential adminis-
trative ability." This honor may
have helped in the unanimous fac-
ulty decision in his behalf.

Approximately twenty years ago.
the nominee from State was a fin—
alist and did win a Rhodes grant.
This year‘s winner will be announc-
ed in early spring.

Lehman Heads For Senate,
Corning Keeps Mayorship

Leading a general Democratic
victory throughout the state,
former Governor Herbert
Lehman was elected U. S. Sen-
ator last Tuesday by a substan-
tial margin. Indications were
that when the final count is in.
his margin will be close to 300,-
000. The victory is generally
trailed as an endorsement of
President Truman‘s “Fair Deal."

On the controversial amend—
mcnt 5, or Veterans Preference
I. a w, indications yesterday
throughout the state pointed to
its passage, although the local
voting was 2 to 1 against it.

On the local scene, Mayor
Erastus (‘orning was reelected to
his third term by a margin of
45,000. l’oliticul observers were
most intcrcstcd in Coi'ning's vic-
tory pluraliiy. sincc, it has been
()lISl‘l'Vl‘tl. ii liirgc margin would
place (‘orning in a favorable po-
sition for the next gubernatorial
campaign.
