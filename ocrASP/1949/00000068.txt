Campus Chest . . .

One member of the Campus Chest Committee
has said that the idea behind the campaign which
opens Monday is more important than the money
garnered. This idea, the feeling of sharing with
Albany and the nation, and of being a part of the
larger units, is basic to the drive. Here is another
chance to step out of our small Albany area (and
even smaller State College limits, since many of
us may not even have become a part of the Al-
bany area). We can, through institutions like
Campus Chest, get a broader perspective.

For that reason, when you go to contribute,
don’t just pull out another dollar and hand it
over because it is asked of you. You might better
keep the money and spend it for something which
has a meaning for you. While the drive will come
out better ﬁnancially if people just give without
thinking, the value to the student is lost unless
he considers that this is a chance to give to Cam-
pus Chest because he wants to, not because he
should.

Campus Chest is not an organization. it is
simply the title, nation-wide, under which it is
possible to have drives for several charitable insti-
tutions at the same time. The money goes directly
from State to the individual beneﬁciaries.

Student Council voted to send money from this
drive to the Albany Community Chest, to the
World Student Service Fund, and to the organiza-
tions for tuberculosis, heart disease, cancer, and
infantile paralysis.

Very good publicity has lead up to the opening
of the campaign. The committee deserves congrat-
ulations for the planning that has gone into this.
But the most important part of the drive is that it
has been aimed at an understanding of its purposes.

Let’s support this drive.

On Trial . .. .

Seems too bad to bring Rivalry up again, es-
pecially since tiie general friendliness and spirit
between the two rival classes is deﬁnitely improv-
ing. But, Tuesday’s trial brought up sotne prob-
lems which should be faced.

The speciﬁcations, regarding what "class iden-
tification” consists of, are not sufficiently cnu-
merated. While that is not pertinent right now, it
will be again in the Spring at Moving-Up Day
time, and also in the next few years. That the
regulation was vague concerning what to wear to
show membership in the freshman class in lieu of
a lost beanie is obvious.

()n the other hand, the rule (lid exist, anti should
have been interpreted in its intention and spirit
by members of both classes.

Two things should be done. Since people who
are fair and sincere may justifiably wonder when
to give a warning and when not to, a set of specifi-
cations should be drawn [1]), published, and duly
entered in next year’s li‘rcshman Ilandbook, cov—
cring as many exceptions to the rule as is possible.

Since, however, it is trtic that it is impossible
to cover every exception with a rule, and un-
necessary as well. this ycai‘s Sophomores, and
those in other classcs, should consider evcry warti—
ing before it is given iii the light of the spirit and
intention of this tradition.

{Libay.

Little Noodik opened his sleep-
ladcn eyes; reached out a searching
hand and shut the alarm off. As he
rolled over to resume his fond
dream of wallowing in exam pa-
pers with huge A‘s written on them,
a thought struck him. Today was
something special. What it was he
couldn’t quite remember, but he‘d
better get up and find out.

He grabbed his baby blue sport
jacket and hand-painted tie, be-
cause he knew this was an impor-
ant day! Rushing out on the street.
he saw long lines of people before
the local public school. A truck was
driving slowly up and down the
street blaring, “Vote NO on amend-
ment No. 5." Little Noodik clapped
his grubby hands in glee—today
was Election Day!

The ﬁrst thought that entered
his pointed head was that he would
have to vote. He ran up to a man,
who was distributing little pain-
phlets, 101 feet away from the polls.
of course. and asked him where to
go. A slow, snakelike smile punc-
tuated by a chewed cigar spread
over the man's face. “Why right in
there, Sonny," he said, “and vote
Row A all the way!”

Little Noodik politely thanked
him, thinking what a kind. helpful
person he was, and ran gleefully
into the schoolhouse.

Here he was confronted by a har—
rassed-looking man with a large
book in front of him. “Did you reg-
ister?" was the inquiry. Little Noo—

dik thought, and as this was a
painful process it took quite a long
time. He recalled registering and
enrolling as a Democrat because
someone had once told him that his
mother's grandmother was one, and
she was a brilliant woman. "Why
yes," he replied, “ and are the Dem-
ocrats Row A or Row B?" The man
took his name and muttered some-
thing about an "intelligent voter.”

Standing in line he overheard
two men in front of him discussing
the new amendments. All little
Noodik remembered about the
amendments was, “Vote NO on
amendment No. 5!" What amend-
ment 5 was he hadn’t the faintest
conception, but it was such a pret-
ty truck! The man at the desk had
called him an intelligent voter, so
he'd better find out what these
amendments were.

He asked the beci'y-smeliing man
in back of him. He replied, “never
read, its bad for the eyes. vote NO
on amendment 5.”

At this point little Noodik was
pushed into the voting booth and
confronted with a mass of levers
and writing He tried to read the
inscription above the amendments.
but he was late for his 10:10 class.
so pushed down the levers to form
a design.

Out in the crisp November air, he
heaved a sigh of relief. He had vot-
cd! This was Election Day. and he
was an intelligent voter!

To the Editor:

Concerning last w-cek’s editorial
headed “We Compete" which was
pertinent to Rivalry and obviously
intended as a reprimand to the
opinions held by some of the vets
enrolled at State. I should like to
make a few comments.

The statement “Until recently, a
block of disinterested veterans his
tended to slow down and discredit
Rivalry" scins unfair. I very much
doubt that the vets want. or iiavc
wanted, to discredit Rivalry They
".i'c apt, however, to be opposed to
parts of Rivalry.

How does the wearing of bcanics,
the demand that fr-tshmcn show
deference to uppcrclnssmen. the
barring 0f frosh from the Rotunda.
the custom of giving warnings for
violation of traditions, and thc tak-
ing of time during meetings of Stit-
dent Association f'or apologies con-
tribute to "school and classpridc,
organization of the class so that
it feels a part, as a unit, of Statc;
helping the i'rosh get to know each
other quickly, helping the fresh and
Sophs to mature by working with
people and by shouldcring respon—
sibility'.’" Why not check the l‘t‘('<
ords to determine whcthci' or not
the vets (lid their part iii sonic of
tho worthwhile phases of Rivalry
such its ntlilctic coinpctition. the
debates, and th-c skits. ’l‘lic rccords

accurate. That part rcnd “maturi-

iiccicd with Rivalry sci'yc this pur~
posc well." This i'ci'ct's. l cxpt-ct. to
the some itctivitics to which lilt'

CLASS RING SITUATION

The Junior class had a meeting to discuss the class
ring situation this week. Quite a few interesting
facts that came out of the discussion through the
Gleason Co. representative were that—last year’s
onyx stones were thicker than in previous years
since they are imported from Europe again rather
than being manufactured; no complaints have been
registered from the class of ’50 as yet tto the com—
pany, that is); our contract saves us 20% on the cost,
making the ring less than a high school ring would
cost; the rings are over contract weight now and any
workmanship defect will be taken care of free of
charge by the company. A better ring could not be
had as far as price goes unless we want to pay at
least $10 more per ring. So-o-o, it seems as though
the complaints are from the few who are hard on
ring Wt'fll' and thus chip or mar their rings while
the many satisfied customers are never heard about.
Also. by tradition, our ring design carries over from
year to year and tilcl’C isn't much possibility of the
design changing. From the facts prtscnted. it seems
as though we really have no cause to complain.

Horrorst Another drive to raise
moneyll Why do they want my
money this time?

Yes, there are a lot of organiza-
tions here on campus soliciting our
scarce dollars, and Community
Chest, to most people, is just an-
other dollar-snatcnmg organiza-
tion. But let us see how each of our
dollars will be put to use.

Thirty-two cents of each dollar
is used for 'givmg our youth train-
ing for citiaenship through inform-
al education, recreations, and group
programs. Albany Boys' Home, the
Boy Scouts, Clinton Square Neigh-
borhood Association, Catholic Youth
Organization, the Girl Scouts, In-
ter-Racial Council. Jewish Com-
munity Center. St. Elizabeth‘s
Guild, Trinity Institution, the Y.-
M.C.A., the Y.W.C.A. each have a
share in that thirty-two cents.

Nine cents goes toward child care.
Albany Home for Children, Camp
Scully, Fresh Air Guild, Albany In-
fant Home, Masterson Day Nursery.
St. Margarets' House and Hospital,
and St. Vincents' Home are includ-
ed in this list.

Twenty-one cents goes toward
Family Welfare, Travelers‘ Aid So-
specialiaed services for travelers
and providing professional nurses
who give skilled bedside nursing to
patients in their own homes. Cath-
olic charities. Jewish Social Serv-
ice. Legal Aid Society, Protestant
Family Welfare, Travelers Aid So-
ciety. and Visiting Nurse Associa—
tions are part of this division.

Six cents goes toward administer-
ing the year round activities of
Community Chest; ﬁve cents helps
pay expenses for the annual fund-
raising campaign.

A bunch of names and facts. to
be sure. but just realize that one
dollar helps thirty social agencies
carry on their activities. Surely we
can forgo one dollar's worth of
pleasurcwone movie and one stin-
dac—to help those in need.

6M1,- ’Communism Is Out Of Dale,’ Says WSSF Secretary Egerton

In Soyles Fireside Speech On European Student Conditions

“The Iron Curtain is a barrier of unrest because of the 2 million un-

the mind. News bounces oﬂ’. We in
England are not unduly disturbed
by Communism because it is out of
date. Ever since Benjamin Disraeli
disproved the theories of Karl
Marx, Communism has been out-
dated.”

This was Philip Egerton speak-
ing, to the crowded Brubacher
Lounge in Sayles Hall last Friday
night, after he had spoken to the
entire student body in assembly.

This young Englishman, a grad-
uate of Dublin College, now trav-
eling as a Secretary for the World
Student Service Fund, held the
Assembly audience in the palm of
his hand as he described world con-
ditions. Later that night at Sayles.
he expanded some of his theories
and answered questions.

In a discussion of Europe,
he said, “By living in Poland, an
American or an Englishman can
destroy two year's propaganda in
ten days.”

“In Italy, most of the students
are anti-U. S. and there is much

was not the case, We do not think
the faculty member in question cx-
ceedcd his authority. considering
that he is directly responsible for
all dramatic equipment in the an-
nex. much of which is purchased
for student use by student funds.
We feel that a little more discre—
tion should have been used in mak-
ing such a criticism and we think
a public apology is in order.

To the Editor:

We, the undersigned, after read-
ing the communication of one Ev-
ci'son Kinn. (trad, in the State Col-
logo News of November 4, 1949. are
greatly disappointed that. our col—
lege should contain such small and
narrow-mindcd people.

It is a recognich fact that the
btst way of learning to speak a
language well is by practicing it iii
the ordinary speech situation. A
majority of other colleges, realizing
this fact. provide tables within
their dormitories where only a cer-
tain language may be spoken, lead-
ing of course to a better mostch
of that language by the students.
A number of us. nicmbcrs of the
French Cliib. have felt this lack
here at Stnic and have set. out. to
i'cincdy this in ottr way. We do cer-
tainly think it would be an cxccl-
lciit idea if students interestcd lll
other languages would do tiic samc.
We have the approval and the full
authiorty of thc cafctcria manage-
ment to do so.

It. was also stated in the afore-
mentioned lt‘iit'l' that. rt‘sct'ving
scith was unjust and that tlic pol-

“French students hope, that in
case of another war, that they will
be occupied. because they will not
ﬁght anymore. They can only take
so much.”

Education in England is on a dif-
ferent level than that of the U. S.
British Co-eds are not primarily
biding time until they marry, ac-
cording to Egerton. As in the U. S.,
tradition is strong in England. A
thorough background in the class-
ics is necessary to the educated
man. “While the world has chang-
ed, the heart of man has not
changed.” Each student has a tu-
tor and all lectures are optional.
However. a good lecturer will have
his room so ﬁlled with students
that they will sit on the beams to
listen.

Among heartfelt thoughts direct-
ed toward the American collegiate
public he stressed:

“Don't lose sight of the fact that
the U. S. is the greatest pOWer in
the world. and far more is expect-
ed of you than was 12 years ago.
More than half the world is looking
to the U. S. for Americanism, and
yet. college graduates don't know
what it is.

China was the ﬁrst place that
Egerton heard about Syracuse.

American Universities have exten-
sions like Yale-in-China, Prince-
ton-ln-China. etc.

American students, by living with
Chinese students. have done much
in furthering the cause of Chris-
tianity. In China. too. the students,
ideas are respected because of their
learning.

Because of his wide travels and
learned insight into many world
problems. Egerton was able to bring
food for serious thought to State
students.
