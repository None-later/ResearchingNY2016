addition, there can be found an ex-
tensive coverage of university ev—
ents, art, theatre, and musrc cri-
tiques, humorous features, an ex-
change column, and on the sports
page, an article entitled, "What is

with their own sports events. Do
drop in and look it over; it is cer-
tainly a paper of high quality.

We have just received word from
the University of Zurich in Switz-

that a “lively interchange of ideas
will ensue.”

Coming back to the United States
we go to the University of Buffalo,
New York, where in The Bee is
found this item: “To those of you
who complain about the yearly
physical examination, here are one
or two items which might interest
you. Of the 6,252 students examin-
ed last year, there were 1,065 de-
fects found, of these there were 12
active cases of tuberculosis and '79

Grind Out 3

Warden, Carter
Star in Crush

Breaking loose with 25 points in
the last quarter Potter romped over
KDR for the Intramural Football
Championship last Tuesday. The
final score was 37-0 in the game
played for the benefit of Campus
Chest.

Playing before a fairly large
crowd on a warm day Potter was
able to show its might on the grid-
iron. It was the passing of Jim War-
den illul. made the big diﬁcrcnce.
Jim passed for thrcc of Potter's
scores while running over once him-
self. The other touchdowns were
scored on two plunges by Carter.
The only extra point was scored
on a Warden to Clcurwutcr puss.
Curler Scores

Thc game started with KDR kick-
ing off ulid Murks rclurncd the ball
10 yards. Four plays brought Pottcr
r'o yurds short cf a first down and
KDR took clcr. Howcycr they could

It seems appropriate toward the
close of our fall season to explain
just what WAA is and how it fits

into the life here at State College.

Sportsmanship i’romotcrl

According to the Constitution. our

purpose is to promote sportsman-
ship and a closer spirit of friendli-
ness among the students of the col-
lege and to help athlctics come to
have a lasting place of importance
ill the students‘ rccrcufion hours.
not only ill collcgc bllt throughout
the years uflcrwurd.

To carry out this purpose it takes
a great (l‘tll of work and friendly
cooperation. Sincc WAA was start-
cd. numcrous other activities have
grown up at Stillc and less time is

Slole Boolers Clipped By‘Sieno,
Will Engage ABC On Tuesday

The Purple and Gold hooters
traveled six miles to Loudonviile
last Monday and it was apparently
six miles too far, as they were hum-

bled by the Sicilamen by a 4-0 during the game Jack Burke ran

score in State's second soccer game
of the year.

The big Iavcl‘agc height, 6’ 1"),
fast Indians from the Northcoun-
try were the early birds, as, in the
first four minutes they built up a
comfortable 3 point lead, and coast—
ed thc rest of the way. A State er-
ror of commission “handed” the
Siena team its fourth poiilt, and
that was late in the last quarter.
State Plays Wcii

State's eleven, an obviously im-
proved squad, played the Green
tighter than thc score indicates.
Only one of tile Sicnu goals was a
legitimate mark. Even that was
scored after but llll‘cc minutes of
play. as the Teachers were forced
to start lllc game "cold," slucc lucir
lich urrivul ullowcd no film for a
prc—gumc warm-up.

Just a few minutcs lutcr a shot
at the Albany goal was stoppcd by
Arnold Dunsky, lhc Pcdugoguc ncl—
tcndcr. Dunsky. however. was play-
ing with an injnrcd thumb. and
the ball hi". lllut sorc fingcr. It
droppcd to thc ground, and rolled
buckwurd through tllc goal posts
for lhc :Lccolld Sicnu murkcr. To add
another brcak. lhc some thing ll'l])-
pcncd within a few minulcs, and u
third goal rcsultcd.

'l‘hc two teams fought crr-nly for
tho rcst of the half. and lhc scorc
was still 3-0 when the whisllc blcw.

It seems that the students of
Siena College have been slightly
misled as to the results of a recent
bowling match between State’s and
Siena‘s varslties. Firstly, State sup-
posedly lost three games to Siena
a few weeks ago. Secondly, State
has acquired five new bowlers.
Thirdly, Slate’s varsity can appar-

into Bob DeRue. the two smacked
into Osta and Beige of the Siena
team. and four men were flat on
the turf. Both Burke and one of
the Siena players Were out cold;
reinforcements from the bench al-
lowed continuance of the game.

ple and Gold play a .letlllll match mm, 1.011 a good game without set_
