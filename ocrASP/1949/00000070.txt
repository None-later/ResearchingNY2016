Myskania Opens Hearing [our TOW“ COST  PlCthOUSG

On ’Red' Women Prolesi

“Hear ye, hear ye—the court
is now in session." Shades of
red warnings but if it isn’t two
frosh protesting to Myskania,
on the afternoon of November 8.

Ken Thompson, acting as
chairman of proceedings, call-
ed Gwen Galllvan to the front.
She reiterated her statements
on the warnings and backed up
her claims with two witnesses.
Taking stock of the situation,
Pat Rathbun ’53 admitted she
was at fault and apologized.

But no such withdrawal was
forthcoming from Thea Neth
'53. Though confronted by the
claims of the three Sophs who
testified that they saw no vis-
ible identification, she continu-
ed to deny the accusation. Ad—
mitting her flippancy to the
two other Sophs who gave the
warnings, Thea claimed that
they did not ask for identifica-
tion In their opinion her rc—
marks left the many Sophs
who had been observing Miss
Neth closely since her recent
apology, wondering if they had
suddenly lost their eyesight.

The verdict has been posted
on the Myskania bulletin board.

Since its ﬁrst appearance on
Broadway, “Our Town” by Thorn-
ton Wilder has been, “a. perennial
favorite and a fine house-getter due
to its fundamentally human and
sincere qualities." The Atterbury
Playhouse‘s production will have
even more signiﬁcance to State
College students since a member oi
the faculty and two students have
been chosen to appear in it.

When casting for the part of the
professor, Mr Atterbury, Producer,
and Mr. Young, Director, thought
of Dr. Paul Bruce Pettit. They were
aware of his acting ability because
of his previous experience on stage
and radio. According to authorita-
tive sources Dr. Pettit does a de-
lightful and outstanding job as
Professor Willard.

Herbert Holland '52 and Gerald
German '51 have minor rol-cs as
baseball players who attempt to
break up the wedding scene. Hol-
land has had previous experience
in Schuyler High School, The Al-
bany Dramatic Group. The Jewish
Cruicr Playhouse. The Trinity
Players and The Community Play—
crs of Albany.

Siudenis Active

Gorinan is a transfer student
from St. Mary's College in Balti-
more, Maryland and has acted with
the Father Ryan Players at Brook-
lyn Cathedral College, Brooklyn.

"Our Town" is acted out before
the back wall of the stage and the
absence of scenery is one of the
revolutionary techniques in stage
production. The plot of the play r-c-
volves around the life of the Webb
and Gibbs families and, according
to Holland, combines genuine path-
os, ﬁne comedy and also, at times.
the three ring circus quality which
Thorion Wilder loves to introduce
in his plays. Sorrow, hope, and fear
enter into the psychology of the

poor and often misiabeled. Sugges-
tions were made to have a larger
variety of food, that it be made
more tempting and that soda could
be sold.

Most comments referred to the
very crowded conditions and some
mentioned that Millie students, by
going in before State students, get
preference on the food.

Suggestions for improvements
were that the cafeteria should be
made heater lash trays or some-
thing for ashes placed there) and
that a separate beverage bar should
be set up for those desiring only
something to drink.

Recommendations 101' the sand-
wich bar were that it should have
better food than the cafeteria now
has, and a wide variety of sand—
wiches. Other ideas were for soup,
salads and chocolate milk to be sold
for longer periods during the. day.

Some interesting comments in—
cluded: "Seats in the cafeteria.
should not be reserved. Seats should
be taken only when the party is
ready to use them. Who wants to
eat with one person sharing your
chair and another your lap, and
somebody's books on too of your
soup dish?"

Somebody also .1.g‘gcstcd adding
colorful posters for the walls, a
juke box, and placing waste paper
and dirty dish containers in less
compicuous places.

chcrai students mentioned that
perhaps the cafeteria could be stu-
dent-run.

in conclusion: “The efficiency of
the cufcicriu could be improved if
there \vcrc additional arrangements
for scaling in the dining room.
However. the cafeteria docs satisfy
student needs satisfactorily. I bet-
cha nobody reads this." iqtiote of a
skeptical one!)

That one Associate Editor is

know that the Soph NeWS try-

Talent is always rewarded on

given to “Mugsy,” (Ken Orncr)
for his serious, moralizing tales
of intrigue, as he displayed the
least lack of talent.

Honored for her greatest lack
of talent was Virginia Adams
who displayed her skill by stay-
ing home ill in bed!

The happy medium in talent
was shown by the antics of the
remaining ninc News neophyte
reporters and their efforts re-
ceived proper acknowledgment!

Hand—picked tics, Bay Shore
and Red Creek as home towns,
red shoes, the Conference Kid,
and a Glamour Gal served as
subjects for talent-less, humor-
