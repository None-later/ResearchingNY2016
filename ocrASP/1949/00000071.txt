Myskania Opens Hearing 'Our Town Cost At Playhouse

On ’Red’ Women Protest

“Hear ye. hear ye—the court
is now in session." Shades of
red warnings but if it isn’t two
fresh protesting to Myskunia,
on the afternoon of November 8.

Ken Thompson. acting as
chairman of proceedings. call-
cd Gwen Gallivan to the front.
She reiterated her statements
on the warnings and backed up
her claims with two witnesses.
Taking stock of the situation.
Pat Rathbun '53 admitted she
was at fault and apologized.

But no such withdrawal was
forthcoming from ’l‘hca Neth
'53. Though confronted by the
claims of the three Sophs who
testified that they saw no vis-
iblc identification, she continu-
ed to deny the accusation. Ad-
mitting her flippancy to the
two other Sophs who gave the
warnings. Thea claimed that
they did not ask for identifica-
tion In their opinion her re—
marks left the many Sophs
who had been observing Miss
Neth closely since her recent
apology. wondering if they had
suddenly lost their eyesight.

The verdict has been posted
on the Myskania bulletin board.

 

Finds Instructor,

By NORINE CARGILL

Since its first appearance on
Broadway, “Our Town" by Thorn-
ton Wilder has been, “a. perennial
favorite and a fine house-getter due
to its fundamentally human and
sincere qualities." The Atterbury
Playhouses production will have
even more signiﬁcance to State
College students sine:- a member of
the faculty and two students have
been chosen to appear in it.

When casting for the part of the
professor. Mr Attcrbury. Producer.
and Mr. Young. Director. thought
of Dr. Paul Bruce P-ettit. They were
aware of his acting ability because
of his previous experience on stage
and radio. According to authorita-
tive sources Dr. Pcttit does a dc-
lightful and outstanding job as
Professor Willard.

Herbert Holland ‘52 and G-crald
Gorinan '51 have minor rolss as
baseball players who attempt to
break up the wedding sccnc. Hol-

Gorman is a transfer student
from St. Mary‘s College in Balti-
more. Maryland and has acted with
the Father Ryan Players at Brook-
lyn Cathedral College. Brooklyn.

“Our Town" is acted out before
the back wall of the stage and the
absence of scenery is one of the
revolutionary techniques in stage
production. The plot of the play r-e-
volvcs around the life of the Webb
and Gibbs families and. according
to Holland. combines genuine path-
os. Fine comedy and also. at times.
the three ring circus quality which
Thorton Wilder loves to introduce
in his plays. Sorrow. hope. and fear

Committee Queries Student Body,

Takes Poll On Cafeteria Status

Under

Council a poll of student opinion served,

regarding State‘s cafeteria condi-
tions has been taken and a report
of the 15~student committee has
been submitted to Student Council.

The questions asked were:

1. Do you often, if ever. buy hot
meals in the cafeteria?

2. Are the prices in the cafeteria.
as they are now. satisfactory to you
in comparison to prices outside of
State?

3. Would a sandwich bar (sanct—
wichcs and bcvcragesl satisfy your
lilllchcoll needs?

4. Additional comments.

A good representation of students.
numbering 355.. were contacted.
Many thought that prices were too
high for a school cafeteria, while

the direction of Student too high for the quality of food

especially sandwiches. In
regard to the food in general. com-
ments came saying sandwiches were
poor and often mislabeled. Sugges-
tions were made to have a larger
variety of food, that it be made
more tempting and that soda could
be sold.

Most comments referred to the
very crowded conditions and some
mentioned that Milne students. by
going in before State students. get
preference on the food.

Suggestions for improvements
were that the cafeteria should be
made ncater lash trays or some-
thing for ashes placed there) and
that a separate beverage bar should
be set up for those desiring only
something to drink.

Recommendations 101‘ the sand-
wich bar were that it should have
better food than the cafeteria now
has, and a wide variety of sand-
wiches. Other ideas were for soup,
salads and chocolate milk to be sold
for longer periods during the day.

Some interesting comments in-
cluded: “Seats ill the cafeteria
should not be reserved. Seats should
be taken only when the party is
ready to use them. Who wants to
eat with one person sharing your
chair and another your lap, and
somebody‘s books on too of your
soup dish?"

Somebody Clsc :.ggcstcd adding
colorful posters for the walls. a
jukc box, and placing waste paper
and dirty dish containers in less
conspicuous piaccs.
