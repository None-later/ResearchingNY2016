Yesterday was “Career Day” for High School
students throughout the state. The reason for set-

Seniors, make up‘their minds what they will do
after graduation. Many colleges, as well as oc-
cupational groups, compete for the interest of the
High School students, and that competition is in-
creasing. Four State College Seniors went to a
typical county meeting, yesterday, under the aus-
pices of the Ofﬁce of Field Services, to answer
questions from the assembled students, and to
try to give them an idea of what State is like be-
yond the academic level.

What they should have had to refer to, and
what students in any high school should have
available to them in making up their minds wheth-
er or not to come to State College, was not there.
About half of the other New York Teachers col-
leges, and almost all private schools have illustrated
brochures, including pictures and write-ups for the
curious high school student to look at. State has
none. True, our catalogs are sent out, but their
interest is mainly in requirements, courses offered,
and so on. Nothing attractive is there to stimulate
interest in student activities, or to show what the
school looks like, or our wonderful dorms, which
should attract many students. As an addition to
l the catalog, a brochure is almost a necessity to
complete the over-all picture.

 

Last year, Press Bureau wrote copy suitable for
such a brochure, as there was agitation for it at
the time. Some of the original pictures from the
yearbook were made available after that book
i came out in the spring. All the materials for the

book were deposited with the Ofﬁce of Field Serv-

ices and Public Relations. The understanding was
 that the materials would be sent to the printers
l by that ofﬁce, and also that printing costs would
be paid by it.

 

Perhaps there is a good reason why it has not
been printed. Might we suggest that, since the
materials are available. the brochure be put out
and used for publicity.

The "Plan"

The “Richardson Plan" has helped but not elim-
inated the congestion on the Richardson stairs.
Classes on third floor are dismissed two minutes
early, those on second floor a minute or two after
the bell rings, with the intention of getting the
people tiff the top floor before those from the sec-
ond cotne piling out.

Although there is a deﬁnite itiiprovemeiit,
, crowds do gather. Students get together to talk
j on second floor who have been dismissed froin third
i illoor; teachers let. their classes out, sometimes,
not according to the “system.”

To get real efﬁciency iii clearing Richardson be-
tween classes, we need the cooperation of both
teachers and students on the “plan.”

By EADE and SCHULTZE —.

 

To the Editor:

The Busy Bee conducted an un-
ofﬁcial poll concerning the present
status of Rivalry at State. The con-
census is that Rivalry in some form
is necessary, but nearly all persons
interviewed insist that it should be
altered since it has strayed too far
from the original purpose of uni-
fying the incoming classes, and is
becoming a slightly disruptive force.
Some individuals expressed the
opinion that Rivalry had been im-
properly explained to the frosh and
that various members of the Soph-
omore class are also fairly ignor-
ant of the aims of Rivalry.

It is my personal opinion that
Rivalry does need a face-lifting,
and pretty soon. We don’t want the
same feelings that are fomenting
dislike of each other among classes
and disgust with the Rivalry sys-
tem to occur year after year.

For one thing. I think Rivalry
has become too “gentlemanly.”
while on the other side. it is be-
coming under-handed. Several peo-
ple have told me that coming out
for Rivalry events has taken on
the aspects of a tiresome chore. be—
cause of a general lack Of interest
in what is going on. We don't want
Rivalry to die; isn't there some way
to transfuse life into it?

Sincerely,
Mitchell Burkowsky
To the Editor and To the
“Personal Peeves” Column:

With all due respect to the noble

cause of the present Campus Chest

drive, circumstances render it ap-
propriate to inject a note here in
behalf of other organizations on
campus.

Granted, the committee deserves
a lot of credit for the thorough job
it is doing, but unfortunately, some
of its advertising tactics are in
question. I refer speciﬁcally to at
least two posters publicizing the
Stokes - Peterson concert, w h i c h
were removed from their apparent-
ly-coveted positions and subse-
quently replaced by the red seal of
“Quilly”—an oversight . . . maybe

. . and a discourtesy . . . certainly!
This is only one of many similar
incidents.

At any rate, kids (of the commit-
teei—would it be asking too much
of you to remember that there re-
main on campus other groups
whose publicity projects, though
less worthy and certainly less sen-
sational, are still important to both
that organization and the students
it concerns? It seems a small favor
to ask that these perhaps feeble at-
tempts, which willingly concede to
your superiority in the field of pub-
licity, be allow-ed to die at least a
natural death. ' (Please ﬁle this
away for reference to your succes-
sors. Thank you.)

P.S. To exonerate myself from
the forthcoming barrage anticipat-
ed. I make a personal plea to all
students to give generously to the
Campus Chest this year.

MUCH ADO ABOUT SOMETHING

The ‘Professional-looking” Art work of Fay Rich-
ards has certainly been a shot in the arm for the
annual task of raising funds for the Campus Chest.
No one can say that this committee has not done a
top-notch job of publicizing and promoting.

Do State men have more sex appeal than women?
Anyone who watched the women bid for "Lashes"
DeGarmo will swear that the men were the more
desired specimens . . . or was it that the women
were more ﬁush this week? Anyway, the fun netted
$22 for the Drive.

Are you one of the 42 State students who will suf-

CONFERENCE FOOTNOTES

While some of us spent the long week-endrecuperat-
ing from, and preparing for mids-ems, our delegates
to the Inter-Collegiate Association Conference at Os-
wego were orating in our behalf. Much was gained
and much was given.

Some outstanding points of the discussion were:

Our insurance is more comprehensive than those
offered at other schools.

Our student government ranks highest as far as
efficiency and participation go among the Teach-
er‘s Colleges.

Some schools have students participate in inter-
viewing prospectivc frosh.

Brockport and Fi'edonia have no sororities and fra-
ternities because of the lack of interest in them.

ICA went on record as favoring a uniform ring for
all colleges comprising the State University of New
York.

A very complete report on this conference will be
published in the next issue of the News. Promises to
be good reading.

REGARDING RUSIIING

At Wednesday's meeting of the Student—Faculty
Committee with the representatives from Inter-So-
rority Council, a discussion was held about the mis-
interpretations of the rushing rules as they were re-
vised last year and which have resulted in a feeling
of indifference in the frosh toward the sororities. This
will be hard to overcome if it persists. The solution
offered was that a big get-together, similar to the
annual Inter-Fraternity Smoker be held soon under
the sponsorship of 1.8.0. at which time the women
could become acquainted.

The rules as they now stand. provide for no "rush-
iiig" during the ﬁrst semester, but do not forbid the
developing of friendships through double dating. eat-
ing together, inviting frosli to the sorority houses
and other means of being friendly.

THE AIR

What with two regularly scheduled radio programs
under the sponsorship of Radio Council, State is
sure getting on the air.

Communists Hold
Former Student
Of State College

Meschter Disappears;
Jailed In North Korea

Capt. Alfred T. Meschter, for-
mer student of State, and chief
Engineer Albert E. Willis, Brook-
lyn, New York, are being held by
the Communist Regime in North
Korea. Meschter, whose hometown
is Kinderhook, New York, entered
State in 1941. The following year
he left to join the service. At the
present time he is a Captain in
the U. S. Marine Corps.

On September 22, 1949 the K0-
rean crew of the South Korean
ship, Kimball R. Smith, on which
Meschter and Willis were acting ts
instructors, inutiiiied and took the
vessel to North Korea. The Ameri-
cans have been held since that date

and are reported safe. The Soviet ~

Union has promised to assist in
freeing both men.

According to Minister Pok Il Woo,
the Americans will be released as
soon as this government “asde our
government officially about it." He
further states "We consider the
American government knows the
Americans are here, but it so far
has not asked our government of-
ficially about it.

There are those who interpret the
home minister‘s remarks as a bid
for the American recognition of the
Conimunistic goveri'mient, with the
release of Meschter and Willis as
bait. It is doubtful that North Ko-
rea would accept any request unless
it came from a government which
recognized it. according to coni-
iiientators.

The report came in a broadcast
from Pyongyang. capital of North
Korea. It said the two men were
receiving "humane treatment" and
might be returned if the United
States so requested. So far. the
United States has refused to have
any dealings with ill-c Communist
regime.

Dean Pierce Recalls Post Days

Of Old Albany Normal School

By JANE COOK

Let's go back to the horse and
buggy days of 1870——to Albany
Normal School. located at the cor-
ner of State and Lodge Streets.
This ﬁne building had been erected
at the cost of $25,000. to replace
the $500 reconverted railroad sta-
tion which had housed the school.

The prim ladies and the chival-
rous gentlemen (that is a rare form
of the species, which is almost ex—
tinct now) boarded in private
homes for about three dollars per
Week. Back in 1844 the first class
had consisted of four ladies and 29
gentlemen, but running true to
form, by 1870 the number of men
had dwindled to eight (the
number, not the men) compared to
29 women. To qualify for admit-
tance, students must have had an
elementary school education and
must have supplied satisfactory ev-
idence of a good moral character.
Tuition and books were furnished
free of charge, and at the end of
the year students were refunded the
amount of fare paid in coming to
school. During their two years of
schooling. the pupils took such
courses as arithmetic, algebra. ge-
ography, natural philosophy, evi-
dences of Christianity. Butler‘s an-
alogy and elocution. The adminis-
tration believed that the students
should receive a thorough drilling
in such studies shown to be best
adapted to discipline and develop-
ing the mind, for those who train
the minds of others must have
well-trained minds themselves.

Miss Anna E. Pierce, Dean Emer-
itus. in recalling her schooldays at
Albany Normal School. says that
as late as 1884. the belief that the

school was chiefly academic in
character still prevailed. Despite
the emphasis on subject matter.

Miss Pierce said flint Normal School

was more like a “Gloriﬁed High
School."

It was about 1890 that President
William J. Milne advocated that
the school should prepare the pu-
pils to think about the “why” and
“what” of teaching. Teachers had
too long been scholars who had
ﬁguratively “cut holes in the stu—
dents’ heads and poured in the
knowledge." Because of his efforts,
the school devoted itself to giving
instruction on the philosophy of
education, methods of teaching, and
other matters that had a direct
bearing on the teacher's work.

Since this program was so ad-
vanced. compared to other schools.
the Board of Regents decided to
confer the degree of Bachelor of
Pedagogy on the graduates. and to
change the name of the school to
The New York State Normal Col-
leg-e. Dean Pierce related that after
this new program was initiated. it
was difficult for the poor teacher
to keep one jump ahead of the pu-
pils. The subject matter was as
new to her a". it was to them!

But it was from this progressive
type of program introduced by
President Millie, that State College
was transformed from the nonde-
script Normal School that it was
in 1870. into the “ﬁne professional
school that it is today."
