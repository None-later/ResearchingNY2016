To the Editor:

We wish to rectify an error in
the letter published last week con-
cerning the “OR-bounds" sign. The
sentence “ . . . considering that he
is responsible for all the dramatic
equipment in the annex, much of
which is purchased for student use
by student funds”, should have
read, “ . . . much of which is pur-
chased for student use by State
funds."

Thank you,
Joan Perlne ’51

A Union In Your Future;
Dorm Excavation Begins

For those who haven't al-
ready beeome conﬁrmed dorm-
steps engineers, here’s how
things are progressing on the
new dorm. 0n the Pierce Hall
side of the project, two steam
shovels and about ﬁve trucks
have excavated the terraces
down to the level of the dorm
ﬁeld. Last Tuesday, the brick
wall leading to the dorm stairs
on the Pierce Hall side was
knocked down with the aid of
a. huge steel ball swinging from
the boom of a steam shovel.
Those who remember when
Sayles Hall was built have been
waiting for the ﬁrst signs of
quicksand or at least a ﬂoating
muck. But So far, the shovels
have only hit loam and blue
clay. There will be a sub-cellar
under the Saylcs Hall side of
the project, which means that
excavation will continue ten
or twelve feet below the level
of the dorm field. Actual con-
struction on the new dorm will
begin soon at the end where
excavation is already in prog-
I‘CSS.

STATE COLLEGE NEWS, FRIDAY. NOVEMBER 18. 1949

PAGE I

 

“Class will tell," runs an old
sports adage, and this proved the
difference as Albany Business Col-
lege battled from behind to tie the
State soccer team at 2-2 last Tues-
day.

The game, played in the cleat-
searred, muddy environs of Blecck-
er Stadium, ended just before dark-
ness clamped its murky hold over
the scene. Starting slowly, and
rather sloppily, the advertised
grudge" battle almost turned into
a ﬁasco as the plays-:3 politely
staged an “after you, my dear Al-
phonse" vaudeville act. Even the
livelier second half was slightly
stagnant, as but few flare-ups oc-
curred; thcse ﬁzzled when cooler-
heads squashed any potential ﬁghts.

State Scores First

The Purple and Gold boot-crs
dr w ﬁrst blood. The ball was kick-
ing around loose in front of the
ABC goal posts. Dean Strickland
smashed it cleanly past the goalie,
who had been drawn out of posi-
tion, and State grabbed the lead.

The Tcuchci‘s dominated play in
the first quarter, as they showed
more spark and dash than the dif-
ﬁdcnt Red and White, but the Owls
came to life in tlic sccond stanza.
and, although they wcrc unable to
score, taught the Pcdugogues a les-
son in soccer. The State defense
was particularly outstanding in the
second quarter. as they were hard
pressed by the flashy and more ex-
periciiccd forward wall of the
Washington Avenue clevcn. The
two Pnuls of thc buckficld. Bullock
and Kirsch, plnycd a brilliant. hard
game in rcpulsing tiic ABC thrusts.

()wl Grub l.cad

Most. of thc action and scoring-
‘fllllL‘ in thc lust quarter. The Busi-
nessmcn, running out of time, put
on n conccnti'ntcd drive to tie.
Their individual skill and ability,
and lack of sonic by the statesmen,
kept the ball in Bed territory. After
about ﬁve minutes of the quarter
had elapsed. a hard drive by one
of thc ABC foi'wul‘ds hit Paul Bul-
lock oii the chcst, and bounded
squurcly through the goal. The
brcak ticd the score for the Owls.
Less than one minute later, a slow
rollcr drivcn toward the Tcuchcrs'
goal by Tony 'l‘ufur, littl-c offensive
lineman for thc ltcd and White,
trickch through thc hunds of goal-
ic Arnold Dunsky. and the Busiiicss

Hockey To Be Attempted
As informal Winter Sport

The call is out for all ice-
hockey players at State. Sev-
eral State students who are
very interested in the sport
have gotten together to form an
ice-hockey team. They have no
official backing but would like
to be an unofﬁcial representa-
tive of State, and if they prove
themselves they would like to
be taken over as a varsity sport.
Anyone who has experience as
an ice-hockey player or any-
one who is a good skater and
would like to learn the game
should contact John Hopkins or
Phil Miller as soon as possible.

The team will practice at
either of these places; Buck—
ingham Lake. the Albany Acad—
cmy Rink, or the Delmar pond.
Practice will start  soon as
there is ice but the team will
meet sooner for organization.
The only equipment needed is
your own skates. A schedule is
planned for this winter, but it
depends on the turnout. Re-
mcmbcr, anyone at State can
try out for this team.

Pin-topplers Fail To Gain Ground
As Siena Racks Up 2-1 Triumph

The Varsity bowling squad met
the Siena Indians for the ﬁrst time
this season Wednesday night at the
Playdium. Judging by the way the
teachers greeted the athletes from
Loudonville, it appeared as if it
was going to be a highly proﬁtable
night for the locals. They began
the hostilities by racking up ahigh—
1y exciting victory.in the ﬁrst game.
Sparde by Mike LaManna’s com-
mendable 201, the Statesman easily
subdued the winning ways of the
Indians for at least one game. The
totals for the ﬁrst game indicated
a sixty-seven pin victory for the
teachers. But it did not take the
visitors long to alter the situation
in the second contest. Hindered by
a number of bad breaks, particular-
ly splits, the Statesman fell by the
wayside to the tune of eighty-five
plus. The ﬁnal game was somewhat
similar to the second as Siena
grabbed an early lead and never rc-
linquishcd it.

After dropping these two games,
the Statesman are still in third
plucc. but they did not lose any
ground in their bid for the runner-
up position as RPI lost a like num-
bcr to the cellar-dwelling Pharma—
cists. Sicnn bolstered their pennant
hopcs by gaining a full game on
tlicir closest rivals. The next match
will bc bowled the week following
’l‘hunksgiving vacation. and thc
l‘il(‘(‘ for second place will go into
full swing as the Varsity five meets
the Engineers.

Rcy Rnpucz garnered the individ—
ual honors for the evening with a
thrcc gamc total of 506. Just a pin
bchind wns Don Burt with a total
of 505 for his evening's efforts.
Mikc LnMannn registered the high
singlc for both teams with his
classy 201. The Sicnn totals were
not as impressive as usual. only one
mun bctici'iiig‘ Rapncz's 506. “Jake”
Jucol) lcd his team with 520.

Last wcck‘s match with the Phar-
macy quintct was one of the ban-
“(‘1' inulchcs of the season for tho

statesmen. Although they dropped
one of the three games, their all-
out efforts were very commendable.
Don McDonald registered the ﬁrst
600 total of the season for the 10-
cals in Intercollegiate play. He was
in top form as he crashed the
charmed circle right on the nose
with an even 600. One of his games
was a mighty 220 bettered only by
Bob Reno‘s 230 which is high single
for the statesmen thus far this
season. In the ﬁrst game of the
three-game set, the druggists nos-
ed out the home team in the tenth
frame by a very narrow margin of
four pins. but the varsity came
back to wrap up the other two.

The members of the squad are
very pleased with the great cheer-
ing support rendered by the college
in recent weeks. The enthusiasm
shown by fellow students has been
very encouraging, and the State
spirit has been commented on very
favorably by the other members of
the league.
