Stokes-Peterson Concert
Attracts large Audience

In the fresh setting of cool
green and rich blue velvet of
Page Auditorium, last Wednes-
day night, the annual Stokes-
Peterson concert attracted a
large audience. Many music
lovers, remembering previous
preformances of Dr. and Mrs.
Stokes and Mr. Peterson atten-
ded, including students and fac-
ulty families.

The expectations of those at-
tending were fulfilled and the
audience gave special approval
to Mr. Peterson‘s opening selec-
tion. Dr. and Mrs. Stokes’ play-
ing of the Prokofieff sonata
brought them back to the stage
for bows several times.

In his final selection, Mr. Pet-
erson struck an especially jaunty
note with his hands-in-pockets
rendition of the 2.:sty “Sea
Charity."

A beautiful bouquet of chrys-
anthcmums was presented to
Mrs. Stokes and it graced the
piano during the latter half of
the concert.

Supreme Court Nullifies
Bill To ‘Oust Subversive:

The Feinbcrg Statute which
directed the Board of Regents
to remove from the public
schools any teacher belonging
to subversive organizations was
declared unconstitutional Tues-
day by Justice Harry E. Schirick
of the State Supreme Court.

He claimed that the law vio-
lated the State and Federal
Constitutions in that it was a
bill of attainder and that it also
contravened the due process
clause of the Federal document.

As a result of this declara-
tion, the case will go to the
Court of Appeals, the highest
tribunal of the state, where At-
torney General Goidstcin will
defend the legislation.

Judge Schirick explained his
ruling in that a person can not
be presumed guilty simply be-
cause he belongs to an organi-
zation. Obviously, an individual
can not be responsible for all
the acts of an organization to
which he belongs.

This law has aroused much
discussion and controversy in
education classes here at State.

Remember Nijmegan? For the benefit of those who don't or have
no occasion to. it is the war devastated city in Holland which Albany
adopted back in 1947. At that time State College went all-out behind
the drive and the result was that food, new clothing and medical sup-

plies were sent to our sister city.

New State College is helping in another drive—relax. this will cost
you nothing but the price of a postage stamp. Various letters from tour-
ists in Nimegan have praised the progress that the city's people have
made with our help and their hard work. The need now is for psy-
chological strength in these uncertain times, the purpose is to keep
