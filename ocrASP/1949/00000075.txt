The Future . . .

The enactment of the Feinberg
Law, and the controversy over it,
only serve to point up the im-
portance of the teacher in inﬂu-
encing the future of the United
States. Nothing is more import-
ant to students of a Teachers In-
stitution than legislation which
will affect them when they begin
to teach.

We do not want any inﬂuence
in our schools which encourages
overthrow of our government or
changes in it in any way other
than the Constitutional provisions
for change according to the wish-
es of a majority of Americans.
Those who do not have the in-
terests of our system and princi-
ples of government should not be
allowed to teach.

But in the Feinberg Law, now
declared unconstitutional, there
are vague statements that might
possibly affect some innocent
teachers (and we will be teach-
ers), who are trying to do a good
job.

Some way to keep the teaching
of Communistic ideas out of our
schools is needed, but the Fein-
berg Law is not that “way.”

Thanks . . .

We owe thanks to the Adminis-
tration, particularly Dr. Nelson,
for being so cooperative in work-
ing out a way of lengthening
Christmas vacation. The request
to him came from Myskania as
a result of agitation from the stu-
dent body. Due to the fact that
The Trapp Family is scheduled to
sing Monday, December 19, it
was impossible to start the vaca-
tion any earlier than Tuesday,
December 20. The Administra-
tion has shown itself to be lib-
eral, and receptive to suggestions
from the students.

No Change . . .

One of the deﬁnite suggestions
that came out of the lCA Con-
ference (see this page) was that a
standard ring, with possibly dif-
ferent color stones for each school,
be adopted by all Teachers Col-
leges in the state. We are now
all part of the State University,
and theoretically have more in
common than before.

But actually, we are still as
separate an identity as we were
before, not centered in a partic-
ular locality.

There is no reason for the col-
leges to change their traditional
rings until a more definite unity
is established, and more in corn-
mon, particularly in regard to
aims (we prepare high school
teachers), is developed. Let's not
change our traditional rings.

STATE COLLEGE NEWI. FRIDAY. DECEMBER 2. 1940

The following series of reports are made by the delegates to the Inter-Collegiate Association Con-

ference, held at Oswego on November 11 and 12.

Throughout the discussions, it was generally agreed that the legislative system at Albany is the

Student Government

The Student Government Committee was compos-
ed of delegates from New Paltz, Oswego, Potsdam,
Geneseo, Fredonia. and Albany.

It was noted that New Paltz has a Student Council
composed of 17 members, four each from the fresh-
man, Sophomore and Junior classes, and five from
the Senior class. The Dean of Women is an ex-
ofﬂcio member, speaking on any measure, but having
no vote. .

The student Council of Oswego, Potsdam and Fre-
donia are similarly arranged. At Oswego, the Presi-
dent of the College is a member of the Council, while
Fredonia has a Faculty Advisor. Also at Fredonia
there is one representative-at-large from the music
department and one from the general academic de-
partment. The Secretary and Treasurer of student
Association are appointed.

Geneseo has a system very similar to ours, except
that assembly attendance is non-compulsory. This
has the resu1t of making it almost impossible to con-
duct business. Out of 640 students, the quorum is
50. However, the same 50 may not appear at successive
meetings so that legislation is often repealed or its
passage made impossible.

Public Relations

Potsdam first told of its set-up for the admissions
committee. On this faculty committee there are two
students who share equally in the admissions pro-
gram. They hold interviews with applicants, and
have an equal vote when the qualiﬁcations of the
applicant are reviewed. This is something that is not
found at any of the other ten colleges in the state.

The Geneseo delegate stated that any student in
school can bowl free of charge any or every Satur-
day morning at the local bowling alleys, the expenses
coming out of the athletic budget.

Various methods were discussed as to how a closer
relationship among the Teachers Colleges could be
fostered through athletics. The inequality of the
strength of the various schools was mentioned, but
it was recommended that a type of competition be
attempted in such sports as bowling which require
smaller teams, among schools which are located near
each other.

The subject of freshman handbooks was the next
topic discussed. Each school had on display copies
of its handbooks, and Albany's was found to be the
only one which was bound with a stiff cover. The
other schools stated that they can make general
distribution of their handbooks to every member of
the student body at a cost of less than the $544 al-
located here at Albany.

College Cafeterias

The Albany delegation was especially interested in
the. meeting concerning cafeterias. since we have been
trying to do something to make our own cafeteria
more worthwhile.

The general opinion of the group was that we
shotild try'flrst to make our rooms more attractive—-
a place With atmosphere, and second, to make it
available to more people for a greater part of the

day. Some suggestions made were:
1 Curtains on the windows
2. A juke box
3. Long, narrow tables instead of round ones
4. Caricatures of faculty members on walls
5. Invitations to faculty members to dine with

students
6 “Meal Tickets"
7. Dinners on a yearly basis
It was found that the prices in our cafeteria corn-
parc very favorably with those in other colleges.

Student Unions

Oswego considered the term “Student Union"
to include the entire social program, administered
there by a Student Recreation Association. This
committee has a line in its budget of approximately
$5,000 to use for Weekly dances, carnivals similar to
our State Fair, and for formals. For a week-end
dance, open to the entire student body, they spend
between $100 and $250 for an orchestra.

Switching again to another topic, the Buffalo rcp-
resentative mentioned that at each home basketball
game, each sorority and fraternity sponsors one game.
This includes providing signs and cheering for the
visiting team, and entertaining them after the game.
It also includes providing entertainment for the
spectators between halves. This sounded like one
idea which could be readily adopted here at Albany.

As is always the case, the question of where the
money comes from was brought up, and a discussion
of the amount of student tax paid at each school
followed. As usual Albany led the list, having the
lowest tax.

Taxes paid yearly by each school are as follows.
with those including extras from that used for stu-
dent budget purposes being noted:

Albany $17
Oswego $24
New Paltz $30
Potsdam $32 (including limited hospitalization)
Fredonia $36
Buffalo $38
Geneseo $55 Iincluding registration fees and

hospitalization)

Sororities And Fraternities

In the general discussion, it was brought out that
Fredonia and Brockport have no sororities or fra—
ternities. Albany and Oswego were the only ones
who encouraged scholastic standings in the sororities
by offering a scholarship cup. Most of the colleges,
however, required standings of a “C” average in
order to join and retain members.

It was decided that sororities and fraternities are
an advantage through the social life they oﬂ'cr, the
aids of rushing in getting acquainted with the fresh-
men. and the aid they give iir maintaining scholastic
averages.

Some disadvantages of sororities and fraternities
were also listed. One of these is the fact that some
organizations are segregated, clue to charter restric-
tions or otherwise. Also mentioned was the fact that
mairy people are excluded from membership, because
of the restricted size of the groups. Another fact
brought out was the fact that financial obligations
are in some cases too great to allow affiliation.

One of the biggest factors mentioned was that
pledging devices tend to make fools out of pledges
felt. was for the inter-sorority and inter-fraternity
and at times tend to hurt marks during pledging
period. One method of avoiding these rules, it was
councils to set limits to pledging devices.

Most schools had no rushing problems. The rushing
period usually consisted of parties given by individual
groups and then the preferential system of picking
new member; after the period was up.

Student Elections

At a Student Elections discussion meeting, prob-
lcms in the counting and casting of ballots arid the
voting on student business were brought forward.

The following general conclusions were reached:
The best place to hold elections is in the assembly
meeting. This has the advantage of reaching u greohl.
majority 0f llio voters, thereby avoiding the necessity
of invalidating elections because of a hick of enough
voters to reach a quorum.

Of the cheral ni-cthods of counting ballots. “II
were valid enough in that they required inujoi'ltv
votes for election. The advantage iii the Albany sys-
t-crn is that. it is ireVer necessary to hold i'cclectlons
or. pi'muu'ics: some of the other colleges are consid-
ering using it in the near future.

Book Stores

At the (lo-op discussion, the one school that lind
a problem was Potsdam. 'l‘heir co-op was strident,
run: open only when the students who Worked there
had free periods, trouble with getting books on time.
and a general inciticiency The group suggested lhnl
the] ask the niluilnlsii'utioii to hire u inunugcr sine:-
it“ the other colleges had one and We illl opei'nle
under the same. principles.

At Broclqiort, the Senior rings Wi'l'c sold through
the (Jo-op. The. average cost of the rings there and
at Potsdam was about. $20. Albany told of their new
Co-op system and urged the other schools to take
back the idea, since they Were all liable to be sued
because of the discounts given on their fair-traded
items. The group decided to suggest to the conference
that IUA go on record as approving it standard col-
lege ring for all the colleges under the new UniVersity
system.

Rested from the “Happy Turkey"
vacation, we turn our thoughts
toward another two weeks of activ-
ities and their—another vacation. In
the meantime, events and happen-
ings go on.

IS SCAGS A GAG? . . .

Last year, Student Association
appropriated $233 for the State Col-
lege Association of Graduate Stu-
dents for activities for this year.
So far, no organization as such has
appeared. For the benefit of all the
Grads here, we’d like to note that
it is to their advantage to use this
money and get organized; other-
wise, it reverts to surplus. Of course.
if the Grads decide not to have
such an organization, it would
probably mean a buck cut off their
student tax. The question is, Grads,
would you rather have a represent-
ative social body of yourselves or
the extra dollar next year?

FROM ACROSS THE SEAS . . .

Every now and then, our school
receives letters of thanks from the
schools in Europe for the money we
sent through CARE as a War Mc-
morial. The latest is from Lehr-
.m'beldungsanstalt (you pronounce
it», Bavaria. Sort of good to know
our boys are being remembered iir
this way.

ternity ribbons being worn by peo-
ple around school . . . the chart put

parison to about. 400 of last year.

WHAT DO YOU THINK . . .

In past years, the Big-4 was
sponsored by Student Council and
thus the money made from it was
spent according to how SC felt it
should be. Now, however, the Big—4
is a part of Rivalry and each class
more or less sponsors each produc-
tion itself. It seems that the classes
themselves should get the money
earned by the Big-4, and spend it
as they see it. Right now there‘s
about $700 in the Big-4 fund of SC.
How about it ’52 and '53—~lct your
representatives know how you feel
about the matter so they can speak
for YOU when the discussion comes
up.

The Albany Institute of History
and Art is in the news again this
week with two fine exhibitions. one
of the earliest portraits painted in
the Hudson Valley, that of Robert
Livingston, town clerk of Albany in
1765, has been placed on temporary
exhibition. The portrait was painted
about 1718 by an unknown artist.

The second exhibition, a one-man
show of landscapes and symbolic
paintings by Erica Brooks, is one
of a series of shows by regional
artists. The exhibition opened on
Monday. Miss Brooks is art director
of St. Agnes School and has been
painting in this country since 1921.
She has lectured at schools and
colleges in England and America,
was Art Chairman for the New
York Branch of the League of Ain-
erican IFen Women and at one time
served on the sketch jury of the
National Association of Women
Painters and Sculptors. She has also
had several one-man shows in New
York. In the exhibition are 1'7 sym—
bolic paintings interpreting the
story of creation. The landscapes
were painted in Idaho just before
Miss Brooks came to Albany four
years ago.

Next week has been designated
by Mayor Coming for the observ-
ance in Albany of Library Week.
In a proclamation the Mayor re-
called this year marks the 25th an-
niversary of the establishment of
the Albany Public Library which
includes Harmanus Bleecker and
Pine Hills Libraries. We know the
libraries are “old stuff" to most of
you. but remember Library Week
when it comes around.

In case any of you are interested
in staying up all night for a cram
session or otherwise, and want some
company, station WPTR has an-
nounced that a 24-hour program
schedule was started on Monday
night. This is the first such sched—
ule in the Albany area.

 

Inflation Hits Boulevard,-
Coffee Price Skyrockets

It may not be new to you, but
it was news to the Newsites
who had fifty cents only at the
Boul the other night. Coffee,
that indispensible liquid, is now
ten cents whether you order it
with a fried single or solo.
According to “Louie,” the chief
of the Boul, coffee has gone up
to about eighty-five cents a
pound retail and it may hit the
dollar mark by Christmas.

If you are apt to wander in
about 10:30, again at noon and
then grab a pick-tip cup again
at 4 p.m., you will be spending
about $.00 extra per week. With
that nine-tenths of a dollar. you
can buy two scrambled singles
and a bottle of chocolate milk!

The rising price of coffee that
must be all in Brazil may
become the subject of a Con-
gressional investigation. It
seems the $00,000,000 the Am-
erican housewife ls losing in
rising prices is vital!

ation in the Annual Anthology of

fied that his poem, “Candlelight
