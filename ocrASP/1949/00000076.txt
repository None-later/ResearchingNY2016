Statesman Overpower ABC,-
Lo Manna Records Mighty 257

The Varsity bowling team, all
dressed-up in their new shirts,
proved worthy of the name printed
on their backs by overpowering
ABC three games to none at the
Playdlum Wednesday night. In an-
nexing the three-game set. the
statesmen also set some new rec-
ords for the other members of the
league to aim at. Mike LaManna
racked up a brilliant 257 to set the
pace in that department. Prior to
Wednesday's match, Charley Parks
of Slena held high single game
honors with a 246, but LaManna
with only two non-strike frames
chalked up a new season high. The
other noteworthy effort turned in
by the teachers was a mighty 977
total in their third game. Missing
1000 by only twenty-three pins, the
statesmen bettered the previous
high of 955 recorded by Siena.

ABC provided plenty of compe-
tition for the locals in the ﬁrst
two games, but fell short by a con-
siderable margin in the finale. The
first game was decided in the tenth
frame with the Statesmen gaining
the edge by twenty-nine pins. Al-
though the opener was a hard-
fought battle, the second game of
the evening turned out to be the
thriller. The last ball thrown told
the story and the Varsity squad
was on the winning end by virtue
of a one-pin decision. It was the
closest game of the season for the
Teachers. The final-e turned out to
be a slaughter with ABC bowing
by a total of 168 pins.

The "grand-opening" of the In-
tramural basketball league fizzled
into just another game last Mon-
day night as forfeits marred the

The Bulls rallied to humble SLS,
32-30. and the Rocks and the frosh
gained forfeit victories at the ex-
pcnso of tho Commuters Club and

evening. Besides his 257, he regis-
tered a big triple of 601. His other
games were 148 and 196, but the
257 was the game that boosted this
total over the 600 mark, a goal
which has been achieved by only
one other member of the squad,
Don McDonald’s even 800. Lyle
Walsh tumbled the maples for a
classy 215 and an equally fine 545.
The other double century mark was
chalked up by Bob Reno, a 207.
Bill Spellman was high for the
losers with 518.

A verdict has been reached re-
garding the Siena-State postponed
match. Both teams submitted let-
ters to the Albany Bowling Asso-
ciation outlining their respective
arguments, and this week the sec-
retary of the association informed
the teams involved of its dccision.
It was awarded to the statesmen
and the match will be rescheduled
at the convenience of both squads.
