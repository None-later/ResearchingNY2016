By DONALD ELY

On the air; “It’s the Radio Coun-
cil Revue from the campus of State
College, Albany." This was the big
moment for the “RPI Committee"
of Radio Council composed of Donn
aid Ely ’51, Joe :Persico ’52, Patricia
Root and William Taylor, freshmen.

Amid the creaking floors of Drap-
er 210 the committee assembled for
its initial recorded broadcast over
Station WHAZ, Troy. Ideally the
conditions for broadcasting should
be a sound proof room with micro-
phone outlets and plenty of room to
move about without running an
obstacle race to get to the desired
microphone. But the broadcast, just
as the proverbial show, must go on.

After overcoming many hardships,
the microphones. recorders. and
other equipment were set in posi-
tion and the broadcast began.

The results cannot be revealed
here but they will be broadcast over
Station WHAZ, Troy, 1130 on the
dial, Monday evening, December 5,

‘at 8:30 p. m.

The whole program is centered

around the work of the committee
in trying to decide what kind of
show they would like to put on over
Station WHAZ and what the colle-
giate listening audience wants to
hear. Illustrative examples adorn
the ideas of the committee. In ad-
dition to the people mentioned
above, the loudspeakers will be
graced with the melodious voice of
Janet Wimbert '52, and a trio com-
posed of Eugene Webster ‘51, Gor-
don Bennett, and Donald Putter-
man, Sophomores.

Not to be outdone by the musical
contingent. the drama interest has
a spot in the form of a mock soap
opera and a dramatic reading by
Christiaan Lievestro '50

All in all there is .sriety galore
and in future programs the com-
mittee will endeayo; to present the
various musical groups of the Col-
lege along with. original radio
drama.

Why not tune in Station WHAZ
next Monday evening to see what
our would-be radio artists have done
and intend to do?
