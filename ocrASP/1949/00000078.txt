Are. They Justified ?

Once again Big-4s are the topic of our discus-
sion. We are 'still trying to ﬁnd one good reason
why they are, for the freshmen and Sophomores,
a part. of Rivalry, ‘or"for that matter, why the
myth of a Big-10 program is still carried out.

Before Thanksgiving, a committee to select a
script for the Sophomore production, which will
not be presented until March 25, was chosen. This
week a similar committee was formed by the fresh-
man class (production date, April 22). No matter
how we approach it, we cannot justify the amount
of time which will be spent in preparation for
these two events.

Even though an outsider would not always be
able to distinguish the fact, the primary function
of the student body is that of studying. Although
justiﬁcation can be seen for a few weeks prepara-
tion for an AD play or a class skit, we cannot
see where one half of the undergraduate population
(in theory, at least), can compensate four months
of their time by the winning—or losing—0f four
Rivalry points. Don’t get as wrong on this sub-
ject, however. We feel that Rivalry in itself is
a good and useful part of the student life. But we
are of the opinion that the Rivalry Committee
should not award points for a Big-4 production.

As an alternative to the production of the Big-4s,
several people have suggested that the two classes
combine their efforts and sponsor an All-College
Dance on Moving-Up Day weekend, which would
indeed seem to be a ﬁtting climax to a year’s
Rivalry.

Viewed as a whole, in fact, we wonder if there
is any justiﬁcation for a continuance of the Big-4
programs. The Christmas production has deﬁnite-
ly floundered during the past few years (although,
we hasten to add, the curtailment of this year’s
program is due in part to the revised scheduling
of Christmas vacation). State Fair is many times
considered as a weekend apart from the Big-4s,
and has become an institution in itself compar-
able to Activities Day or Campus Day; and the
class presentations have been perpetuated only as
another Rivalry event. (If you don't believe it,
where are the Junior and Senior productions?)

Therefore, we would suggest to Student Council
that, instead of debating over the disposition of
funds each year (incidently $700 would buy some
more good furniture for the Commons), they con-
sider the more fundamental question: Have the
Big-4s outlived their purpose?

Why The Secrecy ?

Six weeks ago the election for “Who's Who” was
held. Last week the results were finally announced
to the student body, and in certain instances to
the people who were chosen.

We wonder if there is any logical reason for
the long delay involved in this election.

In fact, we question the wisdom of not releas-
ing the results while the election is still a matter
of current discussion.

The time-worn argument is advanced that it
is not fair to embarrass a person by announcing
his election to “Who's Who” and then have the
reviewing board reject his nomination. However, to
our knowledge at least, no name submitted from
State College has ever been rejected, and there is
no reason to believe that such will be the case in
the future.

Since the appearance of one‘s name in “Who's
Who” is little more than an honor, is it fair to the
recipient to deprive him of the full beticiits of
being so selected?

()ne way to avoid this. and we would suggest
that the persons who conduct the election consider
the fact in rccommendalions to their successors,
is to drop the veil of secrecy and announce the
results immediately after the election.

I hopevyou’ll forgive my inexper-

ience if this calls to your memory 1

past discussions of one of those fa—
mous (or infamous?) Wednesday
afternoon sessions in Room 20,
Richardson. I’m just this week’s
sucker who’s consented to stick his
neck out for the beneﬁt of that en-
thusiastic bunch of Friday morn-
ing rabblerousers.

All of you, I think, have at one
time or another, either heard or
made comments concerning the de-
ficiencies in our school system,——-
looking at the situation from va-
rious angles. Well, I‘d like to con-
sider it from one particular angle—
that of a student at State College
who is earnest in his desire to learn
the art of teaching. Fortunately—
and maybe surprisingly—this spe-
cies of student is not completely ex-
tinct.

Primarily. as you know, this col-
lege was founded for the purpose
of training teachers for New York’s
secondary schools. Speaking. I
grant you, unscientiﬁcally, I can
safely say that the proportion of
enrolled students at State whose
ultimate intention it is to teach, is
deploringly small. The guiding light
of State College, ideally, should lead
in the direction of the teaching pro-
fession and no other. But does it?
If it does then why are there so
many students—even Seniors—who
still don't know what they plan to
do upon graduation? Why?—be-
cause these people have been gross-
ly deprived of a living knowledge

 

Fill Your Class Gift Box,
Attend Christmas Parties

Christmas — the time when
memories of a happy family
gathering seem extra important.
Some of our happiest childhood
reminiscenes center on our
Christmas celebrations.

And so it is with the “kids”
at the Albany Home who look
forward to their State College
Christmas party with almost
the same eagerness as a child
with a home anticipates Christ—
mas Eve. Mr. Howard, the new
superintendent, is also looking
forward to the party because of
the interest the children have
shown in it.

Your chance to get the “ole
Christmas feeling" is in buying
gifts for the children and depos-
iting them in the boxes desig-
nated and showing up at the
parties on Thursday.

Students who have attended
in years past claim that they
have almost as good a time as
the “kids” aml as one says
“when you leave you sort of
believe in Santa (‘laus yourself."

By ROSE MARY WILLSEY

 

of the aspects pertinent to teach-

rig.

The teaching procedures used by
instructors in this “teacher train-
ing" institution, you’ll find, differ
hardly at all from those used in
liberal arts colleges. of course the
two ﬁelds necessarily have common
grounds in the conveyance of sub-
ject matter, as such, but wouldn’t
it be possible for members of our
faculty to include in their class
plans a running commentary on the
why’s and wherefore’s of their own
techniques? And they might also
keep in mind that their students
will later have the responsibility of
teaching some of this same ma-
terial to high school students.

Another suggestion (which I
make very cautiously) is that less
time be required on extraneous ma-
terial in college. I refer spectfically
to the twenty-four hours spent on
"thirds" and “fourths” plus four
hours of gym, plus from six to
twelve hours of freshman science
and mathematics for non—majors
in those ﬁelds. If so much time and
effort of our college career must be
expended in completing our high
school education, then something is
radically wrong with both the cur—
ricula and the teachers of our sec-
ondary schools.

Well. I’ve laid my head on the
proverbial block. All I can do now
is hope that the executioner's right
arm will be suddenly afflicted with
a catatonic paralysis, affording me
the- opportunity to sneak out the
back door, unnoticed. Thanks for
listening.

LOST WEEKEND
This is the weekend of the All-College Christmas
Formal and all that goes with it . . . for everyone
except the basketball team (per usual it seemsi.
Through no one’s fault, the team is playing two
away games on Friday and Saturday. You can show
them that you haven‘t forgotten them by sending
telegrams and well-wishes to Coach Hathaway at:
Fri.—New York State Maritime School,
Fort Schuyler, New York 6, N. Y.
Sat—Pratt Institute Gym, 177 Ryerson St.,
Brooklyn 5, New York
Incidently, the team felt pretty happy about the
cheering and pep at the last two home games, and
did its best to bring home the bacon. How about
keeping it up?
Those new cheerleading uniforms are certainly OK.

LATEST RUMOR DEPARTMENT

Every year, the rumor passes around that Sigmnn
Laudis might become a chapter of Phi Beta Kappa.
However, this year it is a little stronger than usual.
Even with its drawback of excluding Commerce ma-
jors, it would be adding much to our prestige among
colleges in this area.

DOLLAR DICKERING

With an ever increasing student body that will
demand more activities, it becomes apparent that
previous budgets for organizations can no longer be
used as a criteria for determining how much each
group shall receive. Occasions have arisen. and will
continue to arise, when additional funds are needed
and which during the year can come only from sur—
plus. At these times we must judge the need and
then vote accordingly. The same reasoning holds for
budget hearings in the spring. It might mean an in—
creased student fee. but remember that we still have
the lowest fee among the Teachers Colleges. and we
get a lot for a little.

BUREAU OF MISSING PERSONS

The nature of our Student Association meetings
leads us to wonder whether SA has passed through
the era of “rabblerousers.” Could be that everyone
is satisfied with things as they are. or is completely
uninterested in the affairs of student government.
GOOD SAMARI’I‘ANS

The annual Christmas party for the children at the,
Albany Home will be held on Thursday. the iﬁih.
That gives you just seven days in which to get a

give them a good time.

Besides the two programs that
State already has over the air.
which we told you about last week.
there is another program written,
directed, and produced by State
College students. Rather than be-
ing an off-spring of Radio Council,
however, it is "homework" to those
students who are enrolled in Dr.
Pettit's Radio Script-writing and
Delivery Class. The program. which
goes on the air every Wednesday
afternoon at 4:35 p. in. over WOKO,
is sponsored by the Clinton Square
Neighborhood House.

This script-writing class is the
newest addition to our curriculum,
for it just started this year. It is
open only to English majors and
minors; every student in the class
is given an opportunity to Work on
the radio program. If you are in-
terested in writing. directing or
producing a radio program. or in
any other phase of radio work, why
not investigate this new offering.

The dramatic club of Union, The
Mountebanks, will present their
first major production of the year,
Fcrenc Molnnr's "Lilliam," in Han-
na Hall. December 14 through 17.

The play. a fantasy which has
been produced on the continent. in
England, and twice on Broadway.
and was also adapted as a musical.
"Carousel." concerns a barker on a
mcrry-go—rouml in Budapest.

Curtain time for each perform-
once is 8:30 p.111. with a 2 p.m.
matinee on Saturday, December 17.

For those of you interested in
National sports and tennis. Pan-
cho Gonzales will play Jack Kra-
mer in the Armory here in Albany
tonight. Frank Segura and Frank
Parker will also play singles. The
four will play doubles later in the
evening.

Trapp Family Will Give Varied Repertoire In Page Hall,-
Achieves Fame In Austria, Makes Tours In United States

By GRACE SMITH

“They made instant captives of
their listeneis. One seldom sees an
audience so utterly carried away by
sheer pleaciire,” says the Washing-
ton. D. (3., Now after the Trapp
family made its appearance in the
nation‘s capital. Yes, this well-
lmown family of singers which is
to appear in Page Hall December
19 at 8:30 p. m., is expected to bring
us a greatly varied repertoire.

Maria Augusta Trapp, who now
resides in Stowe, Vermont, came

with her husband and ten children
in 1939 from Austria to the United
States. Although they had been
famous as singers in their native
country. they were still a penniless
family. With Mrs. Trapp’s deter-
mination, they decided not only to
make the harmonizing around the
piano great fun. but rather a fine
living here.

The highlights of the program
which they will present in Page
Hall and which is the same one
that they presented in Carnegie
Hall in New York is as follows: “The
First Nowell." “God Rest Ye Mer-
ry Gentlemen." "Stille Nacht" and
other Christmas carols done in Ty-
rolean. and “Sumer is Icumen in"
which is a famous composition in a
Middle English text.

One of the prominent character-
istics of the Trapp family is their
ability to appeal to the thousands
who have never frequented the con-
cert hails as well as to the artistic.
Their programs consist of rollicking
folk songs of many lands, yodels
and mountain calls as well as the

Phi Beta Kappa
Fetes Mcllwaine

Dr. Shields McIlwaine, Professor
of English. has become a founda-
tion member of a new chapter of
Phi Beta Kappa at Southwestern
College, Memphis. Tennessee. Dr.
Mcllwaine war installed in the new
chapter. '1 .auua of Tennessee,
Monday.

This chapter is the first Phi Beta
Kappa chapter to obtain a charter
since 1941. A few Southwestern al-
umni who have made notable ac—
eoimilishments in their fields of
work were selected to become mem—
bers when the chapter was installed.

Dr. Mcllwaine has written “The
Southern Poor White" and “Mem-
phis Down in Dixie." The latter, a
regional study of the Southern city.
appeared last year as the third vol—
ume ill the Society in American Se-
ries of E. P. Dutton & Company.

Two other alumni who were in—
stalled with Dr. Mcllwaine are Abe
Fortes. who is a former Under Sec-
retary of the Interior; and Dr. Sain-
m-l Monk, head of the English De-
partment oi the University of Min-
iicsotn.

Dr. Mcllwaine remarked that he
(lid not receive notice of his being
made a member of Phi Beta Kappa
until the latter part of November
and that lie was taken by surprise.
lle had a very pleasant trip and was
amazed at the lovely sunny weather
the South is having. The installa—
tion ceremony was very impressive.
and Dr. Mcllwaine couldn't help
but be tllllllh‘t‘il since the photo—
graphers look up more time taking
a picture of the participants in the
ceremony than the ceremony itself.

Busy On Future Abode,

Going. going, going upl! Yes,
the price of coffee, but also the
new dormitory which is being
built full-speed-ahead in the
frigid mornings of early Decem-
ber. Looking out my window
from Pierce Hall. I could vague-
ly see through the bluish, foggy
atmosphere (caused by the ex-
tremely low temperature), men
busily carrying long, thin steel
poles and cement which will
comprise what will be our
future abode.

I ventured further to inves-
tigate the actual construction
arid learned that cue-half of
the footing of the building is
already in, and that all of the
foundations are to be finished
before spring with some of the
floors completed.

According to Harry Baird, sli-
perintendent of the job. the men
will continue to work all winter.
()nly forty per cent of the land
has been excavated so steam
shovels will attempt to finish
the digging before the ground
is frozen too solid.
