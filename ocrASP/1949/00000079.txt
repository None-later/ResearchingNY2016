When those of us who have been
through the dramatic mill at State
first heard of Caroline Williams’
proposed undertaking, cries of “Im-
possible” were heard. We are happy
to report that Miss Williams pre-
sentation was for us a highly satis-
fying one. Tuesday evenings are lab
groups, the place for experiments,
and we were glad to see that some
one accepted the challenge.

Obviously the director had lofty
ideals from the ﬁrst, perhaps too
many of them, for we felt that
technical tricks would have to be
added to the symphony Miss Wil-
liams almost succeeded in conduct-
ing. The performance of Donald
Collins could have carried the play
without many of the disturbing
lighting effects; our eyes still bear
the mark of that glaring, ill-placed
olivet.

In regard to Mr. Collins, his
somewhat stoical portrayal was
gratifying to the senses, an excel-
lent bit of casting.

The Choral group was an innova-
tion, but this was off-set by the
confusion which was set in motion
by the three tempters, particularly
their second appearance.

All in all, we were left with a
feeling of a proﬁtable evening thus
far, for in tins instance. “Valiant
was the word for Carrie."

In the second play, Henry Smith‘s
opening fumble proved to be a pre-
diction; the team lost the ball. The
polite laughter which was heard
was due to the visual situation or
the line itself. In none of the play-
ers did we sense an understanding
of the humor of the author, a man
who loved to make people laugh.
There were so many opportunities
where shading of character or han-
dling of line would have brought
out this humor. We could not es-
cape the uncomfortable feeling that
we were being hit over the head.
Mr. Purdy should know better; he,
at least. had the advantage of wide
experience.

We might add that the sets were

sufficiently gaudy, but in the last
analaysis, the Boor, as given, was a
Bore.

 

Although a layman may never
claim his laurels as a creature of
the cast, or at best, have his sun-
dry dramatic endeavors applauded
and abridged in this week's “Va-
riety,” his role in all theatrical per-
formances is a deﬁnite one.

When the quiet simplicity of inan-
ner and restrained eloquence of
Don Collins reached out like a
magnet, it was easy to imagine
yourself a part of that Christmas
morning congregation and listen,
not to an actor saying his lines, but
to an Ai'hcbishop saying farewoll to
his people.

Fifth row center
bit when Dick Clements was on
stage. A mastery of stage tech—
niques is his, coupled with a deft
use of the voice. As the music come
up and joined the chorus we shiv—
ered a bit. However. the chorus
fluctuated between the poetic fer-
vor of the Greek chorus and a te—
dious, at times monotonous drone
of a bee—hive. The popular cliche
“Too much of a good thing" might
be in order here. Yet. we liked it,
and feel that even the author him-
self would have approved. For a
change this layman forgot his ab-
horrcnce for details when he real—
izcd how much was gained from
the play by symbolic lighting cf-
fects.

The delightful histrionics of Joe
Purdy and Cecelia Battisti drew us
out of the 12111 century rut in a
hurry. Joe Purdy carried it with
puerile pomposity and intelligent
acting; cnch gesture was purpOsc—
ful and direct.

In the person of the widow. Miss
Battisti was given a chance to de-
velop an exceptional comedy part.
She did to a point. y-rt the contrast
beLchn hcr voicc as the half-wilt—
ed coqiicttc and thc rncuous rrndi-
tion of a bar maid's yell was :1 bit
incongruous.

D. Clark’s 232
Leads Bowlers

The Intramural bowling league
opened the 1949-1950 season with
a bang Thursday afternoon at
Rice‘s Recreation alleys. For the
inaugural match, the keglers did
extremely well with Dave Clark of
the KDR quintet blasting a tre-
mendous 232 to top the field for
the afternoon. Clark also led the
contingent with a big 566 triple.
Besides his 232 effort, he registered
totals of 147 and 187. '

As a result of the opening match.
five teams are currently sharing
first place. Potter recorded a 3-0
victory over the Commuters, while
KDR goose-egged KB, 3—0. Taking
advantage of no opposition, the Gy-
lnndcrs took three games from the
Faculty, who failed to put in an
appearance. The Fearless Five are
also among the undefeated. because
they eked out a one-pin victory over
VnnDcrzec Hall in the finale of
their three-game set. The EEFS
decided the first two games of their
match with the Coughdrops in the
tenth frame of each game. After
grabbing two four-pin decisions. the
squad turned around and trimmed
their opposition to the tune of 81
pins in the last game. The F‘inks
watched the Beavers bowl them
over in the first two contests. but,
come buck to take the third tilt
by a wide margin.

The Potter entry racked up the
team high single for the afternoon
with a commendable 846. KDR. iii-
spircd by Clark‘s impressive per-
formance, led the field in the team
high thrcc game totals with 2372.
The highest individual Lenin total
rolled by KDR was 821. The EEPS
turned in the third highest of the
afternoon with a 770.

Individual performances were cs—
pccinlly noteworthy. Clark‘s 232 cf-
i‘ort, was threatened by his team-
nintc, Bill Dunn. who toppled the
maples for a handsome 220. Tony
Darcy and Joe Bivinno oi‘ the Pot-
tcr tcnm racked up totals of 516
and 508 to remain 1-2 behind Clark
in the high triple totals. Other 500
cil'orts registered were Ben Wur-
rcll’s 504 and Earl Sipc‘s 503. War-
rcll had the only other 200, a classy
2114, Dnvcy‘s bcst single output was

1119. followed by Sipc's 1118, BM-
nno's 1114, Ken Rutlcy's 1114. and
Mikc Fisk's 132.

The SLS ciui'y drew n. byc the

opening week but. went into octioii
whcn llic lcngiic met this week.

 

 

Oi lM Leagues

Intramural basketball, apparently
forgetful of the passing of the foot-
ball season, blossomed out this week
in an orgy of rough and tumble
play.

Eleven games had been completed
by Monday, and three games were
played last night. The fresh met
the Commuters’ Club at 6:30, an
hour later KDR played the Suspen-
ders. and at 8:30, SLS battled the
Finks.

Powerhouse scoring dominated the
action as the Suspendei's and Los
Locos piled up points around the
half-century marker.

Los Locos Romp

Pete Giordano, a freshman sensa-
tion from Van chsselaer High
School, ran up 16 points to lead
the “B” League leaders to its sec-
ond consecutive overwhelming tri-
umph. Not content to coast after
building up a 22-9 half-time lead.
Les Locos piled it on in the second
half to outscore the Greeks 26 to 5.
Moore, Buchman, Ryder and Pet-
rule all had 7 points for the win-
ners, while Jerry Berger hooped 7
for KB.

The ilnshy and experienced Sus-
penders set a fantastic mark for
the rest of the league to shoot at
as they notched 61 points in an
easy 61-30 win over the predomin-
antly freshmen Lovers. Joe Gas-
pard. a speedy Cortland grad. led
the point-happy Suspenders with 18
points. as he impressed onlookei's
with his sound all-around game.
Jim O‘Brien had 10, Znnchelli, Mc-
Grnth, and Milk notched 8 for the
winners. Pete Teller, another good
i'rosh ballplaycr, led the Lovers with
twelve points.

()vcrtimc Period Decides

In other "A" League games, the
Beavers squcnked to a 34-32 victory
over the Finks. It took an overtime
period to cinch the win. Dan Tau-
roney put in 14 points for the vic-
torious Bcnvers. but Harvey Clear—
water set a high individual mark
for the season by swishlng 19 points
for n losing cause.

A similar score gave the Bulls a
win over the Lovers. Dave Wander
led the winners with 14. Tcli‘cr had
9 points for thc Lovers.

“13“ Lcnguc notion was more ex-
icnslvc. in on early game Los Locos
swcpt. thc lrtnms by 46—22. Giordano

For Second Place

The Law School bowling contin-
gent upset the Statesmen in a rath-
er surprising match at the Play-
dium Wednesday night. Currently
dwelling in ﬁfth place in the league
standings, the Lawyers, bowling
with only four men, tripped the
Teachers in twa out of three at-
tempts. In dropping the decision.
the local squad had their poorest
outing of the season. The ﬁrst con-
est was the only game the States-
men were able to salvage from the
three-game set. Although they put
up a valiant struggle in the finale,
they went down to defeat by the
very narrow margin of three pins.
The second game was a landslide
for the visitors as they chalked up
a winning total of 868 to the losers’
754.

Walsh, ltapacz High

Although the majority of the
team members had a very “rough”
night. Lyle Walsh and Ray Rapacz
bowled consistently enough to reg-
ister totals of 500 or better. Walsh
put together games of 182. 167, and
166 to record a pinnage of 515,
while Rapacz racked up a total of
502 for his three-game effort. It
was the ﬁrst time this season that
a 200 game was not rolled by at
least one of the members of the
Varsity squad. The best single
achievement of the evening was
Lyle Walsh’s 182. Rapacz had two
games in the 170's but the other
totals were not up to par. For the
victors, Buckley rolled a very con-
vincing 220 in the second game,
but, other than that the totals of
the opposition were not too im-
pressive.

Lose Second Place

If State had won three games,
they would now be in sole posses-
sion of second place. because the
RPI entry dropped three games to
the fourth place Albany Business
College. Next week ,the battle for
second place should be settled for
at least a week or two. because the
Teachers are scheduled to meet the
Engineers for the second time this
season. In their first clash, the
Statesman were victorious. two
games to one.

In the other match Wednesday
night. Slcna trimmed Pharmacy
three games to boost their first
place advantage by three notches.
