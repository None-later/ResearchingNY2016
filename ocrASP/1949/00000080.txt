Albanians Hear Concert
By All-Girl Orchestra

It was impressive . . . it was
enjoyable . . . it was an exam-
ple of a well selected musical
program. Such were the re-
marks of those State College
students who attended the Pal-
ace theatre presentation of Phil
Spltalny and his All Girl 0r-
chestra last Tuesday night.

The program lasted a little
over tw0 hours during which
time many of the girls were
featured as soloists. Naturally
everyone remembered Evelyn
and her magic violin playing
“H’Orostacata.” Other favoi'ites
were Jean singing in her con-
tralto voice “The Lord's Pray-
er" and “Adestc Fideles.” as
well as the Novelty Trio with
their animated rendition of
“The Flight of the Bumble Bee"
and “William Tell Overture."

The colorful ensemble con-
cluded their program with a
medley of Christmas carols. af-
ter which time the soloists
stepped forward and thanked a
well pleased audience.

Youthful Legislators Experience Confusion Of Legal Battle Bridge'CIub Names
As Pet Bills Face Defeat Or Victory On AssemblyFloor

By NORINE CARGILL

Perhaps there has been a time
in your life when you have had the
desire to express your ideas on bills
that should be introduced in our
Legislature. Saturday. at the Mock
Assembly, students from nine
schools in the Albany area had the
opportunity to bring their bills. dis-
cuss them in committees. and in-
troduce them on the floor of the
Legislature. The hour and fifteen
minutes spent in committees indi-
cated that the students were aware
of the flaws in their bills since
there was a great deal of revising
and amending. Student advisors
from State admitted that they too
learned about lawmaking procedure
in these committees.

The first bill. from Columbia
High School. which stated that
all persons who failed to vote
through negligence should be tax-
ed, was voted upon section by sec-
tion. or rather, was deleted
section by section since the only
part that passed was the clause that
Election Day shall be a legal holi-
day. However. this fared better than
the second bill. introduced by St.
John‘s High School. which was un-

animously defeated after the ar-
gument was used that it would be
impractical to build eight lane high-
ways between large cities.
Bethlehem Central High School
thought that the New York State
motor vehicle law should be amend-
ed in relation to the compulsory
inspection of motor vehicles by Il-
censed inspection stations and the
making of an appropriation to the
department of taxation and ﬁnance
to carry out this act. It was evi-
dent that extensive research was
done by the students. A sum of
$175,000. as used in the State of
Pennsylvania was speciﬁed in the
appropriation. The general opinion
of the body was that “graft” would
result on the part of the licensed
inspectors and the bill was def-eat-
ed. The next one. a bill to prevent
pollution of rivers and streams. had
as its main provision that the town
and/or factories using streams to
deposit waste material had to build
a disposal plant within ﬁve years
after the bill went into effect. The
penalty. for the factory. to suspend
its operations for a year. was con-
sidered impractical and was chang-
ed to a specific fine (even though

one delegate stated if Lewis could
cause the shutdown of factories she
didn't see why the State couldn't).

An act to amend the New York
State Law in relation to increasing
the number of scholarships offered
to High School students. from the
present number of 1,654 to 3,308.
had the support of the majority of
the Legislature and was passed.

True to legislative form several
bills were omitted clue to a lack of
time. as the closing hour ap-
proached.

State students agreed that Fo-
rum’s Assembly also increased their
knowledge as Well as that of the
high school students.
