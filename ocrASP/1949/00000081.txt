;,_0f the eleven fraternities and sororities on cam-
pus (social, not academic or educational), three
have constitutional requirements limiting their-
members to certain racial or religious groups. In
“all.but two, a' consistant policy over the years has
effected the same restrictions, even though they
are not included in the constitution of the group.

Simply long standing habit is responsible for
these situations, a habit of thinking as well as
the tradition of the fraternity or sorority. Old
habits that no longer serve any purpose or are
actually harmful should be changed for new ones.

How can we justify these restrictions, especially
in a Teachers’ college, under the sponsorship of a
state that has actual legislation to prevent dis-
crimination? We, in teaching, will be faced with
a classroom of mixed ancestry and background, and
will be expected to promote harmony among them.
Before we can teach it successfully, we have to
believe it.

While teaching may seem far away to all but
the Seniors, the Milne school is close enough to
touch. The sorority system at Milne allows a
place for every girl to become a member of a
sorority if she wants to. Yet the students do look
up to us, and they know what goes on at State.
As practice teachers, and practical examples, it’s a
“do as I say and not as I do” philosophy which the
school supports.

The reasons for the development of “specialized”
sororities and fraternities—"Protestant,” “Catho-
lic,” “Jewish,” “white”——may be obscure, but it
is safe to assume that they include: 1. prejudice
based on habit and ignorance, and 2. an attempt
at self-protection by minority groups. And now,
with popular opinion becoming more enlightened,
the archaic habits still hold.

Every sorority or fraternity can develop a cer-
tain character of its own, and attract congenial
members from all groups. Restricting the choice
by race or religion has no basis in improving the
fraternal group, or making it a “going” organiza-
tion. Any group should go further if it can meet
and choose from all the members of the incoming
classes.

Where there’s a will, there’s a way! If alumni
might oppose the “opening up,” (and alumni sup-
port is very important), it can be demonstrated to
them that popular opinion on a nation-wide scale
has swung toward unrestricted fraternal organi-
zations. Most alums want the best for their or-
ganizations. They can be brought around when
they are shown that such a limitation .is hindering
instead of helping the group.

Some frats and sororities, without written re-
strictions, have, by custom, not pledged other
groups. They coulc “open up” without even the
trouble of an amendment, by the simple expedient
of pledging one or two outstanding people—maybe
negro, maybe Jewish, maybe Catholic, maybe
Protestant, but breaking the restricting habit.

Tradition is the soundest reason that can be put
forward for retaining discriminatory (either in
practice or fact) fraternal organizations. That is
not reason enough for keeping some people out of
groups without an equal and fair consideration. on
the qualiﬁcations of personality and character
which are common to all humans.

This is what can be done: The groups can ratify
a constitutional amendment before rushing begins
second semester, if that is what is needed; or they
can talk out and honestly face the situation in each
group before then. It can be done; it only needs
to be tried.

STATE COLLEGE NIWI. FRIDAY. DECEMBER TO. 1949

’5a J/alidaf, see?

 

THE NIGHT BEFORE CHRIST-
MAS AS TOLD BY HUMPHREY
BOGART or DON’T CRY, JOE, IT
GETS YOUR- NOSE ALL MESSY.

Now it’s the night. before the big
Xmas deal, see? The Joint’s been
cased and there ain’t a peep outa
no one. The infants are all sacked
out, thinking of where their next
Scotch-on-the-rocks is gonna come
from. I'm all decked out In my
snooze-suit. about to catch forty
winks myself.

All of a sudden I hears this hell-
uva racket on the roof. Quick like
Sam Spade I goes to the window to
take a gander, see? There’s this
Joker in a. set of red flannels. He
looks like he’s about to pull a fast
one, so I lay low to watch his next
move. “A. second story man," I sez
to myself.

But he's definitely a smooth op-
erator, because he slips himself
down the chimney and out through
the fireplace. (That's a hot one!)
I figure I ain't got no time to call
up the boys and have a confab on
this manuever, so I gotta play it
solo.

I ankles over to him and sez.
“Hey, you with the foliage on your
face, what's your racket?”

“What’s it to ya?”

“Oh. it wisenheimer, huh? Listen.
bud, I got this town sewed up and
I don’t want any strangers in my
territory. What's your angle?
C'mon, sqeal!"

“OK. OK, don’t get your blood in
a bubble, sonny. Ya. see, I’m the
brains behind the biggest toy fac-
tory in the world. I work outa the
North Pole and I got agents all over
the world. You musta seen some of
my boys on the street corners. On

By JEAN INESON, Grad.

 

“OK, bud. I’ll string along with
ya. What’s your handle?"

“I got iotsa aliases. I got names
I ain't even used yet. You can call
me Santa Claus.”

All this while I'm giving the guy
the once-over. He don't pack no
rod, so I figure there’s no percen-
tage in me taking it on the lam.
While I am trying to figure out
the next move, he’s stashing all
these toys and gimmicks around the
rom. When everything is copasetic,
he starts to make his getaway. see?
But before he goes, he tips his lid
my way and sez. “Pleased to have
metcha. Maybe I‘ll see ya next
time I hit town. Merry Christmas!"

Jeez . . .

The “impending doom" mood was

The low front-center. green spot

along the bleak, cold, grey walls

mood intensification by means of
word. action, music and lighting
were not adequate. We were given
variations on the "grey" theme
rather than a gradual immersion
into the purples and reds of psy-
chological horror.

Because of the mammoth cast I
have to contend with, I'm going to
group names and cut comment to a
minimum. Sue Danzis. Madelon Av-

acting in the family portrayal that
as one died off (in the play) and
the next in line assumed her place
in the family circle. the manner-

had gone before seemed to be taken
up by the successor. You three act-

George Ciiristy were the family
men par excellence. Don and Fred
wedded splendidly a conception of

THIRTEEN HOURS ON A BUS . . .

That's a sad story of the basketball team last
weekend. Roads were so slippery that it took that
long to come from New York to Albany. By the way,
no telegrams were received by the team on Saturday
(first time in three years). How about this week?
The addresses are:

Fri—New Paltz State Teachers’ College
New Paltz. New York
Sat—Arlington Inn
Potsdam, N Y.

Potter Club started the ball rolling on the recep-
tions after home games. Now if the girls could get
later permissions for after the games, these recep-
tions would really be successful.

SCAGS AND FACULTY . . .

Are getting together at a social tonight. Glad to
see the Grad organization get started and hope the
ball keeps rolling for the 5th yearers.

LOVE THOSE BIG HEARTS . . .

In the class of ’52 who made their class the biggest
contributor to the SMILES Christmas Party Gifts . . .
on the faculty for contributing about $1 per capita
to Campus Chest. Sort of shows up the 31c per capita
of students.

THE RUMOR CLINIC . . .

Was working overtime last week about the date
we get out for the Yuletide holidays. Many people
seemed to think that if it were not for the Trapp
Family singers on Monday we could have gone home
today BUT—’tain't sodexactly—Music Council check—
ed the date of vacation on October 15 to make sure
the concert could be held then. Maybe we would
have gotten out today—but probably not. Anyway.
it certainly wasn’t the Trapp Family's or MliSli‘
Council‘s fault.

FOR ALL THE FREQUENTERS OF ROOM 20 . . .

All the talk of fire escapes in the new buildings
shouldn't bother you one bit~if there ever was a fire
there the Room 20 occupants wouldn‘t have to worry.
They‘d all be stewed students by the time that stick-
ing door there was opened!

REMEMBER THE LOAN FUND? . . .

Set up last year for 31500 by Student Association.
According to Mr. Fulvio, the ﬁnancial secretary of
the college, the legal wording is being worked on by
a State Committee and as soon as it is completed
will be submitted to Student Association for approval.
Just in case you‘ve been wondering what happened
to the money.

WE LIKE . . .

That coke machine in the Commons that makes
change when you buy a “pause that refreshes" . . .
the spirit shown at the rivalry volleyball games
Wednesday night (things are pickin’ iipi . the
saving of 20% on train fare on holidays if we ﬁll a
coach . . . the new mailbox addition of the Teacher
Placement Vacancy Notifications in Lower Draper.

K. K. K. . . .

No. not the famous tor infamous! group you‘ve
heard about. but a new motto—Keep Our Kainpus
Klean . . . a. plea worth remembering when smoking
in the Commons or the peristyles. This is your school
and it's up to you to help keep it neat and clean.

DUCK AND RUN . . .

That‘s the cry when crossing Western Avenue ill
the intersection with State and Robin on the corner
of the school block. Student Council is investigating
having a stop light put there so students crossint:
these streets won't have to have rubber legs to dodge
the onrushing cars.

@9044!“ Camp»!

By BRADY and LIEPMANN

 

Music and Music Council are
the key-words today, and let us
start off by mentioning that Music
Council is sponsoring the Trapp
Family Singers who are coming to
the Page Hall auditorium this Mon-
day night at 8:30 pm. We hope that
we will see you there for we’re sure
that you will enjoy the program.

Other MuSic Uouneii activities?
Well, last Monday night, members
of Music Council ushered at the
concert sponsored by the Civic Mu-
sic Association of Albany. This is
a. regular job of the Music Council,
if going to such a program can be
called a. job.

Then Music Council sponsors the
Operetta put on annually by the
Operetta class here at State. This
year, they are putting on another
Gilbert and Sullivan opperetta,
“Patience.” Work has already be-
gun on this production, and we Lin-
derstand that the lead parts are
already chosen.

Music Council also sponsors the
annual Stokes-Peterson concert, al-
ready given, their annual Spring
Concert, and other special pro-
grams, as their Trapp Family Sing~
ers.

Turning back to Radio Council,
have you heard any of their pro—
grams yet? Why not make it a
point to? As we told you before, the
purpose of "Capital Campus" this
year is to acquaint the public with
the activities of State, both curricu-
lar and extra-curricular. So far.
they have devoted a program to
the Education department and this
past Wednesday, they spoke about
Music Council. The week we return
from Xmas vacation, they will dis-

cuss the AD classes. Remember,
that's Wednesday nights at 10:15
pm. over WROW.

State Greets Yuletide Early
As Merrymakers Gather

Santa Claus still has nine
days to prepare his reindeer for
their long trip, but many State
students haVe already acquired
that Yuletide spirit. The An-
nual Christmas Ball found over
two hundred and ﬁfty couples
decked out in their best bib and
tucker, dancing to the music of
Steve Anthony and his band.
Vivid. pale and soft colored
gowns made a dazzling picture
for those who might have view-
ed the formal.

“The photographer will snap
you" was the order of the eve-
ning, for as the elevators clang-
ed open on the thirteenth floor,
bright lights of cameramen
greeted the incoming couples.

The Ballroom of the Hotel
Ten Eyck was decorated with
balloons strung in a net from
the chandeliers. At 12:30 a.m.,
Carroll P. Gallavan cut the
streamers and the decorations
floated into the hands of the
merry—makers. Many of the
balloons will take their places
beside blue and silver programs,
helping to preserve memories
of a wonderful evening.

four front ones after Christmas!

It’s really true that books rank
high on State lists, Santa. Do you
have a hot copy of Shakespeare’s
Songs for Marty Spencer or “The
Egyptian,” or “For Whom the Bell
Tolls," for Bert Jablon?

In the wishful thinking depart-
ment, Ben Jackson and Tom
Hughes want their BA and MA de-
grees, Mary Fenzel needs an “A”
in Physics and Marvin Poons could
use a trip to California!

Mitch Burkowski has been very
busy (trying to scoop the NEWS)
working on the Busy Bee, so how
about straightening out his next
years' schedule?

Just being home will make Ginny
Norton happy, but if New Year's
Eve is clear and snow—less, she will
be all set for a swell vacation.

All the gals here want clothes,
including such necessities as South
American Lamb coats, ski oufits and
nylons.

That's about all Santa. except the
toy department. Jerry Dunn wants
an erector set so he can build
bridges over the electric train that
you’re going to bring Eve Wolfe.

And, you won‘t have to visit Ken
Thompson this year. Santa, because
she got all she wanted last Satur-
day night! (it‘s an opalil.

We'll be waiting Santa—
