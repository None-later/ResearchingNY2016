Feature Oi Athletic Aesociaiionst“Conference ’

in mm HARRIS

With delayed messages, broken-
down biases and rescue parties at
Union Station, delegates from
twei'lty colleges assembled here at
State on December 9 for the an-
nu'alv‘ convention of the NYSFCWAA
(to-the uninitiated :— New York
State Federation of College Wom-
en’s Athletic Associations).

Themeeting was called to order
by 'our Iowh WAA President Ruth
MattesonI Holliday ’50. Notable to
the delegates from State, Phyl Har-
ris ’51 and Joan Haggerty ’52, was
the friendliness of all the delegates.
They. remarked that it helped to
launch the much prepared-for con-
vention and over-ride the “stuff-

tions tend to exude.

Miss Harriet Brown of the De-
partment of Physical Education of
Skidmore presented a rather chal-
lenging oratory in regard to WAA's,
their purposes. aims and achieve-
ments. In short, her speech was the
springboard for the afternoon dis-
csusions in which the individual
delegates presented their contribu-
tions.

After comparing our WAA with
the groups represented at the con-
vention. it was amazing to learn
just how well situated we are here
at State. Contrary to popular opin-
ion many of the State Colleges were
better off ﬁnancially than some of

NYSCT included.~

As usual, the question of Varsity
teams created quite a furore, with
nothing decided. when the smoke
cleared. The varleus delegates be-
gan to enumerate other problems.
One which seemed to be a com-
mon‘ complaint was the lack of
well-instructed refs. Some good
ideas were brought forward and
perhaps we shall be able to use
them in our own basketball season.

All in all the confab was very
enlightening, a closer fellowship
with colleges throughout the State
was formed, and in turn our mem-
bership in the National Federation
of College . Women‘s AA‘s was
strengthened.

Retain Third Place Position

RPI strengthened its grip on sec-
ond place in the inter-collegiate
bowling league Wednesday night by
taking tw0 out of three games from
State Teachers College. In drop-
ping the ﬁrst two games the States-
men missed a golden opportunity
to pass the Engineers in the league
standing. Prior to the match the
Teachers were only percentage
points out of the runner-up posi-
tion. At the same time, the pace-
setting Indians from Siena also
dropped a pair. Thus the gap be-
tween ﬁrst and third places re-
mains unchanged, a cool four
games. When the league resumes

the statesmen will roll off their
postponed match with Siena. This
will give the locals an opportunity
to crowd the Indians for top rung
honor if they are victorious. Wed-
nesday night the statesmen found
the going rough in the ﬁrst two
games but ﬁnally located the pock-
et in time to annex the finale. The
second tilt was the most humiliat-
ing defeat.

The Teachers have had experi-
ences this season. RPI trounced
them by a 106 pin margin, but the
varsity turned the tables in racking
a 77 pin victory in the ﬁnal game
of the evening!

Lyle Walsh was the only member
on the squad who gained a 500 to-
tal. In registering a sum of 507,
Walsh edged his teammate Mike
LaManna by 10 pins for high triple
honors. The high single for the
evening was Walters’ 185, collected
in the third game. Mara and Cush-
irrg were the big guns for the Engi-
neers. Each rolled triples of 530 or
better.

Jackson Returns

Scoring a 51-40 verdict over New
Paltz early in the season last year
State then dropped the second
game by the count of 61-50. Among
the men back from last year for
New Paltz are Jackson and Ross.
Jackson was was the big gun in
the second game, scoring 12 points.
New Paltz uses a zone defense, but
they do switch into a man to man
defense when Ross is out. So far
this year New Paltz has a. two and
one record and will be tough to
beat on their home court.

Not too much information is
known about Potsdam except that
they are of about the same caliber
as the other teachers colleges. They
play New Paltz and Plattsbul'g and
have about the same year round
record against them as State.
