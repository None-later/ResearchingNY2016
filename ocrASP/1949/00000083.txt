To the Editor:

The item on the workshop on
New York State—its geography,
government, and history, which ap-
peared in the December 9 issue of
the News. was most unfortunately
reported. Credit for putting on the
workshop should go to the Social
Studies Department of the Milne
School (not the College). and par-
ticularly to Miss Haines and Mr.
Snyder. They are the ones who had
the idea, who did the work. and
who deserve the credit.

 

 

Sincerely yours.
.1. T. Phinney

What is the annual epidemic rap-
idly rising to its peak throughout
all the colleges and universities?
Have you noticed the symptoms—
cheery faces, gayly wrapped pack-
ages, Christmas carols and pag-
eants? You’ve diagnosed it—the
Christmas Spirit! How are the va-
rious colleges furthering this wel-
come virus? Read on!

New Mexico Lobo, University
01’ New Mexico

Students seeking rides home for
the Christmas vacation may ﬁnd
them through the Sophomore class
travel bureau. The service is car-
ried on at no cost to students, and
is the annual" project of the class.
(’52, Note Wellil) ‘

Dave Burt will make a parachute
jump from the East Mesa Air Park.
He will be dressed as Santa Claus
and is being sponsored by a local
merchant.

Drake Times, Drake

University, Des Moines, Ia.
Capacity crowds are expected for

both performances of Handel’s

Messiah. —A 500-voice chorus com-

posed of Drake students and Des

 

 

Moines musicians will perform in
the annual presentation of the ora-
torio.

San Jose State College,

San Jose, Calif.

A white Christmas tree decorated
with angel hair and reaching to a
white crepe paper ceiling will es-
tablish the theme of winter beauty
at “Wintermist” tomorrow night.
Revolving lights changing colors
every three seconds will shine on
the tree.

Daily Orange, Syracuse University

It is unfair that the administra-
tion should ask students to stay
two days more before Christmas
vacation starts. How much will be
digested by the student when he
knows that all his friends from
other universities and colleges can
go home almost a week before he
can?

If we are able to leave the Uni-
versity on Saturday, the 17th, many
of those who do not have classes
that day will be able to go home
Friday. thus relieving the crowded
transportation conditions.
