“How much I have missed you
since last we were together." En-
dearing words such as these are
written in various letters posted
around the school. Anatol, the re-
cipient, has shown himself to be a
popular fellow. To help clear up
any mystery that might be con-
nected. in one of the Elementary
Dramatics three one-act plays, to be
presented January 17. Anatol. alias
Gerald German. is the great lover
in the comedy. “Episode.” He is an
all around fellow and a lady’s love
means little to him.

Gorinan has really given his
whole heart. soul, and blood to
make the play a great success. He
arrived one evening at rehearsal
and almost collapsed from lack of
blood. Actually. he gave this vital
substance to the Bender Laboratory
on South Lake Avenue.

Ren Dow, who has the difficult job
of Christianizing Albany. His main
trouble comes when he attempts to

Archibald Mac ._.-t.~a"". play "Air
Raid" is quite a ctr—finite contrast
to the other two productions. Orig-
inally written for the radio. it is
now being adapted to the stage. A
deep poetical drama. the setting of
“Air Raid“ is in a mythical coun-
try during a ficticious war.

Robert Donnelly is having diffi-
culty with tlic sound effects for
the play. At the end of the produc-
tion most. of the cast are killed by
machine gun fire and bombs. It also
seems that Donncliy allows the
players to die first. and then he
sounds the guns. He has been rc-
tircd to the rear of the auditorium
along with his sound effects and
has to use telepathy to judge when
the planes are to arrive.

Renewal Policy For '50

Student Council
OK’s Holiday

From Assembly

According to the year’s assembly
programs. a business meeting was
scheduled for this week's assembly.
Since there is no business to be
discussed and this fact was not
known in sufficient time to plan
entertainment. Assembly will not
convene today.

At the Student Council meeting
Wednesday evening. it was an-
nounced that the rivalry ping pong
games would be held next week.
and the bowling n'iatches would
take place the following- week.

As a token of sympathy express—
cd by tlic students for Dr. Evan
Collins. President of the College.
on the death of his daughter. Stu—
dcnt Council voted that a collec-
tion be taken up in the next assem—
bly. which would be donated to the
Rheumatic Heart Disease Ward of
the House of the Good Samaritan.
Boston where Miss Collins was
treated.

The council also discussed what
action should be taken with the
Big-4 fund, a sum of $700, which
has been accumulated from the
class Big-4's. the Christmas Big—4's
and State Fair contributions. The
general feeling was that the money
should go toward improvement of
tlic school. Suggestions as to a
worthwhile investment of the fund
include returning the money to the
classcs who contributed same.
starting a scholarship or loan fund
for students. and using the money
for decorations and improvement of
thc cafeteria. It was proposed that
ihc Commons be improved by add—
ing more tables and chairs. another
ping pong table and installing a
vcntilating system. In the next as-
sinibly students will be requested
to offer suggestions for thc cxpcu-
diiurc oi‘ the Big-4 fund.

Teacher Shortage
Causes Revision

The State Education Department
has decided to continue the issu-
ance of renewable high school
teaching certiﬁcates until March 1.
1951. These certificates must be re-
newed each year for a. period of
five years upon evidence of contin-
ued study on the part of the “in
service" teacher. This is a change in
policy only for the teaching year,
1950-1951. The department compil-
ed statistic". last fall. and recently
arrived at a point where ir could
make this decision.

The reason for this change is
that certain fields of high school
teaching have present-day short-
ages, even thouin State College
doesn't train for most of the fields
in which there is evidence of a
shortage.

Commerce. Library Need Teachers

The State Department does not
want to mandate the fifth year re-
quirement to one ﬁeld of high
school teaching at a time. They feel
that the high school teacher supply
and demand will close most aca-
dcmic fields to fourth year gradu-
ates except Commercc Will Library
by June of 1951.

This renewal 01 teaching certiﬁ-
cates means that all State College
fourth-year graduates this year. Will
be eligible to receive renewable cer-
tiiicates. and may register with the
T.P.B.. from which they were ex-
cludcd up to now.

Mathews Slates Meeting

Students should be reminded that
the holding of a renewable certifi-
cate does not mean that they can
go anywhere to touch. for schools
are still required to give preference

to the ilftli year candidate.
Elmer C. Mathews Head of
Teacher Placement Bureau. will

hold a meeting next Friday in Room
20 at 3:30 pm. for all those stu-
dents not registered with the bu-
rcau. who desire teaching positions
for '50-‘o1.
