presented on the 25. We take a
breather on March 31 with
Spring Recess and come back
in rainy April on the 13th for a
new period of events. Not only the
showers of the month, .but the

Three weeks ago today, we saw
what I consider to be the best AD
lab presentation so far this year.
It was a highly emotional melo-
drama that moved steadily to a
violent climax which was thorough-
ly satisfying and convincing to the
audience. As director, Joan Perine
should be congratulated on a fine
job of all around production, espe-
cially the casting.

I would hesitate to choose be-
tween Martha Downey and Dave
Shepard as a recipient for the
highest laurels. Both did an excell-
ent job of sustaining their char-
acter throughout the play, which is
a commendable feat in itself.
Especially pleasing were Dave and
Martha's facial portrayals and very
natural movements about the stage.

We all remember vividly the
breakfast action in the second
scene, the two parents as they
heard the news of their son’s death,
the struggle between the two for
possession of the paw, and finally,
the climatic action of the last two
wishes.

The rest of the cast was over-
shadowed by the two principals.
Joseph lFurdy was rather unconvin-
cing and weak in his part, Walt
Kellar was adequate. and John
Lindberg made us rely too much on

our previous knowledge of the play.

In the behind stage group, I
wculd like to single out the make-
up creator. Very frequently, I think
that this department overdoes it-
self, but even sitting as I was in
the front of the auditorium, I was
not aware of undue grease paint,
but only of a well done job that
added greatly to the character’s
and the play's success. Another be-
hind stage act that impressed me
was the excellent timing of tiie fi-
nal curtain. '

On the other side. I 11nd n "ew
comments. I would question the
blue spotlight on the fireplace ii.
the last scene. I have written after
the word sets, “adequate, but not
spectacular." and "disconcerting"
for the mechanical difficulty of the
door. But all these criticisms are in—
deed slight compared to the way I
criticized the audience for its un—
warranted laughter during the sec-
ond scene. Were the remarks of
members of the audience that pro-
voked this laughter really neces-
sary?

How these comments will agree
with yours is unknown to this spec-
tator, but I think it is safe to say
that we £111 felt this play to be a
fitting program for the last assem-
bly of the year 1949.

Engelbert Requests Prom Aid

William Engelhart. President of

Varsity Bowlers
Clip Siena Twice,
McDonald Stars

Coming from behind on two dif-
ferent occasions. the Varsity bowl-
ing tciini cased nearer first place
by taking two out of three games
from the league-lending Siena In-
dians Wednesday night at the Play-
diiiiii. In the first contest, the two
squads went into the tenth frame
all tied up with the locals gaining
the verdict utter a well-fought bat—
lie. The second game was a close
fight until the inter frames when
illi‘ Stutcsincn unleashed a power
llllll netted them a sixty-five pin
iictory, Bolh tcuins bowled well Ill
the finale with the Indians coming
out on top by il margin of twenty-
loiir pins.

’l'h.‘ iiidii'idiiiil performances of
the 'lciichci's were especially notc-
worthy with three members of the
sound recording totals over 500. Don
McDonald regained his early sea—
son form by smashing out a 570
ii'ipll‘ including games of 192, 195.
and 183. Lyle Walsh, after a shaky
start, came through with a three-
giinic total of 531 with singles of
143. 193. and 195. Putting together
games of 160. 166. and 187, Bob
Reno also crashed the 500 circle
with 5113. Welsh and McDonald tied
for high single honors with 195.

On Thursday afternoon at five
o‘clock the State kcglcrs rolled off
their postponed match with Siena
at the Playdium. If the Statesman
wcrc lll)i(‘ to rack up n whitewash,
ihc top spot in the league stand-
ings would be shared by three
teams; Sicna, R51. and State. The
three tennis would each have a to-

Sports Desk Black-Draped;

Ediois Held Us To Draw
Editorial staff finally accept-
ed a three-year old challenge
of the SPORTS STAFF to a
bowling match. On Saturday
evening. December 17, in a
small annex of Hoffman's soda
parlor, the spectacle was con-
summated by three sterling
wielders of the mighty pen,
five members of the editorial
staff, and one plebian that
SPORTS STAFF took as a
handicap (no offense Ruth,
you did better than most of us).
The generous SPORTS STAFF,
deciding to give the editorial
staff a chance, waived the ser-
vices of that champion perfor-
mer, and writer of your varsi-
ty bowling stories, Bob Reno.
Mary “the ball must have
been loaded” Fenzel, bowled a
mighty 203, for the three
games. that is. Evie, “was that
pin boy named Tom Collins?"
rolled 96, 89 and 78 (I wonder
what tired her out?i Goldie “I
found that room" Brenner, was
responsible for the relief of her
entire team; Shirley “not quite
high enough" Wiltse, head
ediot, had trouble keeping her
balance at the crucial moment
but by singing to the ball main-

tained a fine average. Jerry
“Pinhead” Dunn rocked and
roared in high but. Jerry—

does sliding over that foul line
mean anything?

As for the SPORTS STAFF
we can only say: Blind bowled
the best game but the laurels
go to Andy “if it hadn't been

ing really high.

We really loved every minute
of it and to prove our feeling
for the edicts we here and now
challenge them to a basketball
game.

As Undefeated,

Dave Clark paced the intramural
bowling league with a high triple
of 600 and the high single game of
246 at Rice's Recreation Center on
Thursday, December 15. Despite
Clark's magnificent performance
the E.E.P.S. downed K.D.R. two
games to one.

In the other games the Gyland-
ers eked out a one pin victory to
salvage one of their three games
with Potter. S.LS. continued their
whining streak by downing the
Coughdrops 3 games to 0. The Fac-
ulty team broke into the win col-
umn by taking 2 out of 3 matches
from the Beavers. The Commuters
blasted the Fearless Five 2 games
to 1 and the Finks goose egged
KB. 3 games to 0.

Other outstanding performances
were turned in by Tom Sinkledamn
who smashed the maples for a 579
triple and 209 single. Juisto rolled
a 546 triple for Potter while his
teammates Davey and Biviano
were hitting the pins for 513 and
509 totals. Vienncau got a 510 tot-
al and a 205 single while Ryder got
a total of 503 pins and a single of
201.

As a result of the matches S.L.S.
took over complete control of first
place with a 6-0 record. In hot pur-
suit are Potter and E.E.P.S. each

AI New Paliz, Potsdam State

New Paltz State Teachers College
and Potsdam State Teachers Col-
lege were the victims of a pre-va—
cation rally which evened up State's
basketball record to four wins and
four losses. The boys played good

serving of the final scores.

7-1 in the first five minutes. and
by the first quarter State trailed
20-8. but by half time they had
tied the score 24-24. In the second

in the lead. Kaolin and Brown con—
tributed two more foul shots b-c-
l'orc the game's end.

By HARVEY MILK

 

Varsity basketball was brought
back to State in '46 and the only
thing to change in its program
since then are a few of the teams
We play and the players themselves.
It’s about time for the much need-
ed changes -— finding a basketball
court to play on and the removal
from student control of all varsity
sports.

Although I have mentioned two
changes above, the first would be
taken care of if the second change
is brought about. Once varsity sports
are out of the hands of the entire
student body, plans can be made
for the expanding of our sport pro-
gram without the fear that one or
two “rebel rousers" will lead the
student body against this move-
ment. Now MAA is stopped from
making plans in advance because
it has to wait for 1200~students to
make up their minds as to how
much of their money they should
spent for each item. Under the
present set up we cannot schedule
basketball games in advance. If
control was separate. plans could be
made for five or more years in ad-
vance if we wish to. But not now.
Under our set up we have to fight
for every penny and at the drop
of a hat our basketball or baseball
program can be stopped. There is
no security whatsoever under our
set up that we will have any sports
program here at State next year or
not. And in plain words that
STINKS!

Improve the Conditions

If varsity sports are taken out of
student control it can be made into
a profit making organization and
turn these profits over for tile bet-
terment of the athletic program.
Permanent means of transportatoin
can be procured, a better plaCe to
play our games can be gotten—and
it's about time for that. Now the
team is playing on a court smaller
than most high school courts. Now
the varsity and junior varsity both
have to practice at the same time
in our “band-box” and that ain’t'
good! The conditions which are
forced on our team are no good
and the sooner the change the bet-
ter for all. If we had a field house
or Armory to practice and play in
maybe more men will want to play
on our team and the quality of the
team might then increase; the cy-
cle could repeat until someday we
might look around and find a top
notch team here at State. Also a
training table could be bad if
enough money is made.

No More Problems for You

Under our set up if a new sport
is wanted we have to bring up be-
fore S.A. reasons for this and that
and half of the people don't know
what is going on. only that Joan
Jones is going to vote against this.
because someone on the baseball
team voted against giving money to
her organization. If there is no
control and we want a new sport
and there is enough money for it
we start the sport. Under a separ-
ate organization there would be no
problems for the students to worry
their little heads about—everything
would be taken care of by a coun-
cil made up of several faculty mem-
bers and several members from
MAA council. All problems would be
taken care of -— your student tax
would be lowered—if you don’t want
to go see any games you won't
feel that you're losing any money
—and you won’t hear any argu-
ments as to how much the ping-
pong balls are going to cost you.

The time is ripe for action to be
taken and remove varsity sports
from the control of the students.
Our teams are handicapped. They
are playing under poor conditions.
Give them and yourselves the break
that ‘iill bring a decent athletic
program to State. Before the end
of the school year a proposal will
be brought up before SA. to re—
move varsity athletics from stu-
dent control—give it your support
mit‘s time to nmve to a bigger court.
The Case of the Lost Basketballs

Things get pretty bad when six
basketbiills and one clock are lost
from the intramural basketball
league. Six teams were suspended
—at this time three were reinstat—
ed. Maybe we should buy a watch
dog to keep guard of the equip-
ment - yes! things are bad when
college students can't keep track of

52 the equipment they use.
