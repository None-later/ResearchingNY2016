Teaching Varied-Language Pupils Announce Hours

Teaching on a Carribbean Island,
where there is no income tax and
where servants to look after facul-
ty members abound, sounds like a
pretty good deal, doesn’t it?

Such is the situation of Dick
Hayford ’49. who is new teaching
math and physics at Ruston Acad-
emy in Havana, Cuba.

Ruston is primarily a co-ed pre-
paratory school for students inter-
ested in engineering. Many of its
graduates eventually attend M.I.T.

One of the greatest difficulties
that Dick has encountered is the
language barrier. Since the stu-
dents are versed in Spanish. Eng-
lish, French and/or some other
European language, various termi-
nology has to be changed to fit the
students’ backgrounds. There is a
section for Spanish-speaking pu-

ils and one for those who speak
English, Dick teaching in the lat-
ter.

Overcrowded classes just don't
happen with Ruston’s 500 students,
64 teachers and '76 servants. Courses
and subject matter vary to the ex-
treme that a Cuban third year
Physics student may not be as well
trained as an American general
science student.

Havana is a cultural center to

the extent that its Philharmonic
orchestra is largely composed of
the best of European artists who
fled the war. The faculty itself is
rather cosmopolitan, and the stu-
dents have had war and travel ex-
periences to make them a distinc-
tive group.

According to Hayford. positions
in Cuba, and the mainland of
South America, are administered
through the United States office of
Education and anyone wishing to
gain foreign experience in this area
should write this office for further
information.

Puts Feather In ’51 ’5 Cap

It was Sattidy after-lunch
and the mob was draped around
the room and I sez to the mob
1 sea: “What’s with this burg
that there ain’t nuthln‘ cookin’
tonight?" And one of the boys
hands me the word that the
Juniors are holdin’ a blow-out
or sump’n at a place which is
being owned by some lush nam;
ed Herbert.

Always ready to snare some
i‘eerl, we ankle over and frame
some tables with our presence.

Now the meal is alright, see,
I mean it was jake. Herbert can
wield a mean cook book. Ami
while we has thus and so en-
joyed our meal, what should
come trottin' out but a skit!
Now a skit ain‘t nuthin’ like a
skoit, you get me. but this skit
was o.k. They dug up the rec-
ord on this Junior Class and I
got the clue that this class was
a pretty jake bunch of Joes.
Somebody said that the she-
bang was a feather in the Jun-
iors' caps. and the boys and I
put our dough on that one.
